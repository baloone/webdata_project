{"id":"334261902_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Dermatology-Where_We_Are_and_the_Way_to_the_Future_A_Review","abstract":"Although artificial intelligence has been available for some time, it has garnered significant interest recently and has been popularized by major companies with its applications in image identification, speech recognition and problem solving. Artificial intelligence is now being increasingly studied for its potential uses in medicine. A sound understanding of the concepts of this emerging field is essential for the dermatologist as dermatology has abundant medical data and images that can be used to train artificial intelligence for patient care. There are already a number of artificial intelligence studies focusing on skin disorders such as skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and onychomycosis. This article aims to present a basic introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence as well as present an overview of the current research into artificial intelligence in dermatology, examining both its current applications and its future potential.","authors":["Daniel T Hogarty","John C Su","Kevin Phan","Attia Mohammed"],"meta":["July 2019American Journal of Clinical Dermatology
