{"id":"324525309_A_Stakeholder_Approach_to_Strategic_Management","abstract":"The purpose of this chapter is to outline the development of the idea of \"stakeholder management\" as it has come to be applied in strategic management. We begin by developing a brief history of the concept. We then suggest that traditionally the stakeholder approach to strategic management has several related characteristics that serve as distinguishing features. We review recent work on stakeholder theory and suggest how stakeholder management has affected the practice of management. We end by suggesting further research questions.","authors":["R.
