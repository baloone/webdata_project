{"id":"257334470_Algebraizable_logics_with_a_strong_conjunction_and_their_semi-lattice_based_companions","abstract":"The best known algebraizable logics with a conjunction and an implication have the property that the conjunction defines a meet semi-lattice in the algebras of their algebraic counterpart. This property makes it possible to associate with them a semi-lattice based deductive system as a companion. Moreover, the order of the semi-lattice is also definable using the implication. This makes that the connection between the properties of the logic and the properties of its semi-lattice based companion is strong. We introduce a class of algebraizable deductive systems that includes those systems, and study some of their properties and of their semi-lattice based companions. We also study conditions which, when satisfied by a deductive system in the class, imply that it is strongly algebraizable. This brings some information on the open area of research of Abstract Algebraic Logic which consists in finding interesting characterizations of classes of algebraizable logics that are strongly algebraizable.","authors":["Ramon Jansana"],"meta":["November 2012Archive for Mathematical Logic 51(7-8)","DOI:10.1007/s00153-012-0301-z"],"references":["268550518_BCK-algebras_do_not_from_a_variety","228589293_An_Abstract_Algebraic_Logic_View_of_Some_Mutiple-valued_Logics","228353261_On_semilattice-based_logics_with_an_algebraizable_assertional_companion","220592531_Implicational_semilinear_logics_I_A_new_hierarchy","220388426_Logics_Preserving_Degrees_of_Truth_from_Varieties_of_Residuated_Lattices","220297879_A_Survey_of_Abstract_Algebraic_Logic","38355186_Algebraic_Study_of_Two_Deductive_Systems_of_Relevance_Logic","314037126_Introduction","285511531_BCK-algebras_do_not_form_a_variety","279957435_Trends_in_Logic_50_Years_of_Studia_Logica","268620428_The_Equational_Definability_of_Truth_Predicates","266704118_Correspondences_between_Gentzen_and_Hilbert_systems","265545869_Protoalgebraic_Logics","265438215_Algebraizable_Logics","243773437_A_General_Algebraic_Semantics_for_Sentential_Logics","239786329_A_General_Algebraic_Semantics_for_Sentential_Logics_2nd_Edition","225129652_Leibniz_Filters_and_the_Strong_Version_of_a_Protoalgebraic_Logic","223410204_Definitional_Equivalence_and_Algebraizability_of_Generalized_Logical_Systems","220298283_Leibniz_Filters_Revisited","220298256_Selfextensional_Logics_with_a_Conjunction","220297940_The_Suszko_Operator_Part_I"]}
