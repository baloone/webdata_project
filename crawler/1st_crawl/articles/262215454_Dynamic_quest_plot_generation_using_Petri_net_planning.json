{"id":"262215454_Dynamic_quest_plot_generation_using_Petri_net_planning","abstract":"In most cases, the story of popular RPG games is designed by professional designers as a main content. However, manual design of game content has limitation in the quantitative aspect. Manual story generation requires a large amount of time and effort. Because gamers want more diverse and rich content, so it is not easy to satisfy the needs with manual design. PCG (Procedural Content Generation) is to automatically generate the content of the game. In this paper, we propose a quest generation engine using Petri net planning. As a combination of Petri-net modules a quest, a quest plot is created. The proposed method is applied to a commercial game platform to show the feasibility.","authors":["Young-Seol Lee","Sung-Bae Cho"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1145/2425296.2425304","Conference: Proceedings of the Workshop at SIGGRAPH Asia"],"references":["266211095_Narrative_in_Virtual_Environments_-Towards_Emergent_Narrative","260658514_Experience-Driven_Procedural_Content_Generation","247168849_Petri_Nets_for_Game_Plot","228919622_Cellular_automata_for_real-time_generation_of","228782329_Dynamic_plot_generating_engine","228771322_The_quest_in_a_generated_world","228599842_A_declarative_model_for_simple_narratives","227336057_Automatic_generation_of_adaptive_educational_and_multimedia_computer_games","226544393_Search-Based_Procedural_Content_Generation","225663459_Exploiting_mobile_contexts_for_Petri-net_to_generate_a_story_in_cartoons","224229687_Context-Aware_Petri_Net_for_Dynamic_Procedural_Content_Generation_in_Role-Playing_Game","220978408_Automatic_Story_Generation_for_Computer_Role-Playing_Games","220851347_A_Role_Casting_Method_Based_on_Emotions_in_a_Story_Generation_System","2558539_The_Virtual_Storyteller_Story_Creation_by_Intelligent_Agents","291080805_Lecture_Notes_of_the_Institute_for_Computer_Sciences_Social-Informatics_and_Telecommunications_Engineering_Preface","290561961_Procedural_content_generation_and_level_design_for_computer_games","254003504_A_prototype_quest_generator_based_on_a_structural_analysis_of_quests_from_four_MMORPGs","221274387_Automatic_Customization_of_Non-Player_Characters_Using_Players_Temperament","221274355_Personalizing_the_Player_Experience_in_MMORPGs_Pre-print","220978324_Supporting_Dialogue_Generation_for_Story-Based_Games","7070973_From_linear_story_generation_to_branching_story_graphs","3776157_Petri_nets_for_modeling_and_coordination_of_robotic_tasks","3776145_Hybrid_modelling_of_transportation_systems_by_means_of_Petri_nets","2416017_Computing_Story_Trees"]}
