{"id":"314630028_ABET_accreditation_for_optical_and_photonics_engineering_the_why_and_how","abstract":"The authors have recently been involved with ABET (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and multiple professional societies, educational institutions and industry to develop program criteria for the accreditation of optical and photonic engineering programs at the undergraduate and masters level. These collaborative efforts have resulted in the first published criteria for university programs in optics and photonics. We will discuss the motivation for seeking membership in ABET, who ABET is and what it does, the process used to develop program criteria and the value of accreditation to both students and industry. This presentation will also include a segment addressing the steps involved for those optics and photonics engineering programs seeking ABET accreditation and resources that are available to assist them.\nABET has a long history of global engagement with the overarching goal of promoting and improving the quality of technical education worldwide. We will also discuss ABET’s international activities and how they support ABET’s mission of providing world leadership in assuring quality in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education.","authors":["Kathleen B.
