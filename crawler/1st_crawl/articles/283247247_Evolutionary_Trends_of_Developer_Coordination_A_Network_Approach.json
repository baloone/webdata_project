{"id":"283247247_Evolutionary_Trends_of_Developer_Coordination_A_Network_Approach","abstract":"Software evolution is a fundamental process that transcends the realm of\ntechnical artifacts and permeates the entire organizational structure of a\nsoftware project. By means of a longitudinal empirical study of 18 large\nopen-source projects, we examine and discuss the evolutionary principles that\ngovern the coordination of developers. By applying a network-analytic approach,\nwe found that the implicit and self-organizing structure of developer\ncoordination is ubiquitously described by non-random organizational principles\nthat defy conventional software-engineering wisdom. In particular, we found\nthat: (a) developers form scale-free networks, in which the majority of\ncoordination is primarily managed by an extremely small number of developers,\n(b) developers tend to become more coordinated over time, limited by an upper\nbound, and (c) initially developers are hierarchically arranged, but over time,\nform a unique hybrid structure, in which core developers are hierarchically\narranged and peripheral developers are not. Our results suggest that the\norganizational structure of large projects is constrained to evolve towards a\nstate that balances the costs and benefits of developer coordination, and the\nmechanisms used to achieve this state depend on the project's scale.","authors":["Mitchell Joblin","Sven Apel","Wolfgang Mauerer"],"meta":["August 2017Empirical Software Engineering 22(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10664-016-9478-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["312973190_The_Impact_Of_Human_Resource_Management_Practices_On_Turnover_Productivity_And_Corporate_Financial_Performance","301878650_Classifying_Developers_into_Core_and_Peripheral_An_Empirical_Study_on_Count_and_Network_Metrics","287506983_From_Aristotle_to_Ringelmann_a_large-scale_analysis_of_team_productivity_and_coordination_in_Open_Source_Software_projects","326710867_Hierarchical_organization_in_complex_networks","318574976_Classifying_Developers_into_Core_and_Peripheral_An_Empirical_Study_on_Count_and_Network_Metrics","308823779_From_Developer_Networks_to_Verified_Communities_A_Fine-Grained_Approach","292218038_The_social_structure_of_Free_and_Open_Source_software_development","291537922_More_on_the_measurement_of_inequality","285111988_The_empirical_mode_decomposition_and_the_Hilbert_spectrum_for_nonlinear_and_non-stationary_time_series_analysis","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","281352662_Impact_of_Developer_Turnover_on_Quality_in_Open-Source_Software","281263059_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaboration","279273719_Open_Source_Engineering_Processes","277468861_Familiarity_Complexity_and_Team_Performance_in_Geographically_Distributed_Software_Development","276935841_Introduction_to_Information_Retrieval"]}
