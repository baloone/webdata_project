{"id":"318652935_A_Multi-Scale_CNN_and_Curriculum_Learning_Strategy_for_Mammogram_Classification","abstract":"Screening mammography is an important front-line tool for the early detection of breast cancer, and some 39 million exams are conducted each year in the United States alone. Here, we describe a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a curriculum learning strategy that achieves high levels of accuracy in classifying mammograms. Specifically, we first train CNN-based patch classifiers on segmentation masks of lesions in mammograms, and then use the learned features to initialize a scanning-based model that renders a decision on the whole image, trained end-to-end on outcome data. We demonstrate that our approach effectively handles the \"needle in a haystack\" nature of full-image mammogram classification, achieving 0.92 AUROC on the DDSM dataset.","authors":["William Lotter","Greg Sorensen","David Charles Cox"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["311737086_Deep_Multi-instance_Networks_with_Sparse_Label_Assignment_for_Whole_Mammogram_Classification","304010711_Automatic_Microcalcification_Detection_in_Multi-vendor_Mammography_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","289585420_Representation_learning_for_mammography_mass_lesion_classification_with_convolutional_neural_networks","313037786_Automated_mass_detection_in_mammograms_using_cascaded_deep_learning_and_random_forests","311449305_National_Performance_Benchmarks_for_Modern_Screening_Digital_Mammography_Update_from_the_Breast_Cancer_Surveillance_Consortium","305825605_Large_Scale_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Aided_Detection_of_Mammographic_Lesions","305193512_Unregistered_Multiview_Mammogram_Analysis_with_Pre-trained_Deep_Learning_Models","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","283262727_Benefits_and_Harms_of_Breast_Cancer_Screening_A_Systematic_Review","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift"]}
