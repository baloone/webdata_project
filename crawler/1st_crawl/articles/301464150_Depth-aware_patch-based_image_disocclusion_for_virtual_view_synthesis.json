{"id":"301464150_Depth-aware_patch-based_image_disocclusion_for_virtual_view_synthesis","abstract":"In this paper we propose a depth-aided patch based inpainting method to perform the disocclusion of holes that appear when synthesizing virtual views from RGB-D scenes. Depth information is added to each key step of the classical patch-based algorithm from [Criminisi et al. 2004] to guide the synthesis of missing structures and textures. These contributions result in a new inpainting method which is efficient compared to state-of-the-art approaches (both in visual quality and computational burden), while requiring only a single easy-to-adjust additional parameter.","authors":["Pierre Buyssens","Maxime Daisy","David Tschumperl√©","Olivier Lezoray"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2820903.2820920","Conference: SIGGRAPH ASIA 2015 Technical Briefs"],"references":["261277195_Joint_texture-depth_pixel_inpainting_of_disocclusion_holes_in_virtual_view_synthesis","224242177_Depth-based_image_completion_for_view_synthesis","8264912_Region_Filling_and_Object_Removal_by_Exemplar-Based_Image_Inpainting","285906123_High-Resolution_Stereo_Datasets_with_Subpixel-Accurate_Ground_Truth","283093561_Inter-view_consistent_hole_filling_in_view_extrapolation_for_multi-view_image_generation","228747651_Depth-image-based_rendering_DIBR_compression_and_transmission_for_a_new_approach_on_3D-TV","224203600_Depth-aided_image_inpainting_for_novel_view_synthesis"]}
