{"id":"265128868_Extraction_methods_for_the_determination_of_phenolic_compounds_from_Equisetum_arvense_L_herb","abstract":"Polyphenols are a very important group of pharmacologically active compounds. The extraction yield of selected phenolic acids and flavonoids from Equisetum arvense L. herb has been determined by use different methods of extraction – Soxhlet extraction, ultrasound assisted extraction (USAE), and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Methanol and 80% aqueous methanol were used as extractants. The crude extracts were evaporated to dryness and prepared for fractionation of the analyzed compounds by solid-phase extraction (SPE). An alternative method used for the isolation and purification of analyzed polyphenols was matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD). Samples containing the phenolic fraction were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Quantitative analysis was performed by the external standard method and use of a calibration plot for each standard. The most effective technique was ultrasound assisted extraction. Only for caffeic acid the highest yield gave exhaustive extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The methods were validated in terms of accuracy, precision LOD and LOQ.","authors":["Anna Oniszczuk","Rafał Podgórski","Tomasz Oniszczuk","Wiola Żukiewicz-Sobczak"],"meta":["November 2014Industrial Crops and Products 61:377–381","DOI:10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.07.036"],"references":["261763267_Optimization_of_ultrasonic-assisted_extraction_of_phenolic_compounds_from_bovine_pennyroyal_Phlomidoschema_parviflorum_leaves_using_response_surface_methodology","244749125_Effect_of_sample-preparation_methods_on_the_quantification_of_selected_flavonoids_in_plant_materials_by_high_performance_liquid_chromatography","236165772_Maximizing_total_phenolics_total_flavonoids_contents_and_antioxidant_activity_of_Moringa_oleifera_Leaf_extract_by_the_appropriate_extraction_method","234104080_Comparison_of_ultrasound-assisted_extraction_with_conventional_extraction_methods_of_oil_and_polyphenols_from_grape_Vitis_vinifera_L_seeds","233939798_Optimisation_of_ultrasound_assisted_extraction_of_phenolic_compounds_from_Sparganii_rhizoma_with_response_surface_methodology","47520620_Plant_Phenolics_Extraction_Analysis_and_Their_Antioxidant_and_Anticancer_Properties","284053483_Ultrasonics_Sonochemistry","275094469_Antioxidant_capacities_and_total_phenolic_contents_of_infusions_from_223_medicinal_plants","267033619_The_effect_of_different_extraction_techniques_on_the_composition_and_antioxidant_activity_of_cherry_laurel_Prunus_laurocerasus_leaf_and_fruit_extracts","260013915_Antioxidant_capacity_phenolic_compounds_and_minerals_content_of_blackcurrant_Ribes_nigrum_L_leaves_as_influenced_by_harvesting_date_and_extraction_method","259957155_Comparison_of_various_techniques_for_the_extraction_and_determination_of_antioxidants_in_plants","259828662_The_effect_of_different_extraction_techniques_on_the_composition_and_antioxidant_activity_of_cherry_laurel_Prunus_laurocerasus_leaf_and_fruit_extracts","257371971_Influence_of_solvent_on_the_antioxidant_and_antimicrobial_properties_of_walnut_Juglans_regia_L_green_husk_extracts","255928918_Comparison_of_matrix-solid_phase_dispersion_and_liquid-solid_extraction_connected_with_solid-phase_extraction_in_the_quantification_of_selected_furanocoumarins_from_fruits_of_Heracleum_leskowii_by_hig","236074816_Ultrasound-assisted_extraction_of_phenolic_compounds_from_Laurus_nobilis_L_and_their_antioxidant_activity","235376987_Equisetum_arvense_hydro-alcoholic_extract_Phenolic_composition_and_antifungal_and_antimycotoxigenic_effect_against_Aspergillus_flavus_and_Fusarium_verticillioides_in_stored_maize","223300302_Antioxidative_activities_of_water_and_ethanol_extract_from_field_horsetail_tsukushi_Equisetum_arvense_L","222345407_Recent_Advances_in_Matrix_Solid-Phase_Dispersion","51819095_Effect_of_Equisetum_arvense_and_Stevia_rebaudiana_extracts_on_growth_and_mycotoxin_production_by_Aspergillus_flavus_and_Fusarium_verticillioides_in_maize_seeds_as_affected_by_water_activity","46010495_Matrix_Solid-Phase_Dispersion_with_Sand_in_Chromatographic_Analysis_of_Essential_Oils_in_Herbs","41189155_Recent_Developments_in_Matrix_Solid-Phase_Dispersion_Extraction","41012488_Matrix_solid-phase_dispersion_MSPD_in_chromatographic_analysis_of_essential_oils_in_herbs","24210907_Optimization_of_matrix_solid-phase_dispersion_extraction_method_for_the_analysis_of_isoflavones_in_Trifolium_pratense","12427680_Applications_of_Matrix_Solid-Phase_Dispersion_in_Food_Analysis","10917462_Matrix_solid-phase_dispersion_for_the_liquid_chromatographic_determination_of_phenolic_acids_in_Melissa_officinalis","7771744_Sedative_and_anticonvulsant_effects_of_hydroalcoholic_extract_of_Equisetum_arvense","7749817_Optimization_of_the_sonication_extraction_method_of_Hibiscus_tiliaceus_L_flowers","6689487_Matrix_solid_phase_dispersion_MSPD","5856197_Sample_Preparation","5812983_Matrix_solid-phase_dispersion_extraction_versus_solid-phase_extraction_in_the_analysis_of_combined_residues_of_hexachlorocyclohexane_isomers_in_plant_matrices","5595009_Trends_and_Recent_Applications_of_Matrix_Solid-Phase_Dispersion","5480202_Solid-phase_extraction_versus_matrix_solid-phase_dispersion_Application_to_white_grapes"]}
