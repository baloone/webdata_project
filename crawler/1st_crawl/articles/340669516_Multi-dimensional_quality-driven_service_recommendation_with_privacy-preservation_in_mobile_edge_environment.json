{"id":"340669516_Multi-dimensional_quality-driven_service_recommendation_with_privacy-preservation_in_mobile_edge_environment","abstract":"With the advance of mobile edge computing (MEC), the number of edge services running on mobile devices grows explosively. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to recommend the most suitable edge services to a mobile user from massive candidates, based on the historical quality of service (QoS) data. However, historical QoS is a kind of private data for users, which needs to be protected from privacy disclosure. Currently, researchers often use the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique to achieve the goal of privacy-aware recommendations. However, existing LSH-based methods are only applied to the recommendation scenarios with a single QoS dimension (e.g., response time or throughput), without considering the multi-dimensional QoS (e.g., response time and throughput) ensemble, which narrow the application scope of LSH in privacy-preserving recommendations significantly. Considering this drawback, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional quality ensemble-driven recommendation approach named RecLSH-TOPSIS based on LSH and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) techniques. First, the traditional single-dimensional LSH recommendation approach is extended to be a multi-dimensional one, through which we can obtain a set of candidate services that a user may prefer. Second, we use TOPSIS technique to rank the derived multiple candidate services and return the user an optimal one. At last, a case study is presented to illustrate the feasibility of our proposal to make privacy-preserving edge service recommendations with multiple QoS dimensions.","authors":["Weiyi Zhong","Xiaochun Yin","Xuyun Zhang","Shancang Li"],"meta":["April 2020Computer Communications 157(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2020.04.018"],"references":["336600837_Link_prediction_in_paper_citation_network_to_construct_paper_correlation_graph","336280504_Efficient_computation_offloading_for_Internet_of_Vehicles_in_edge_computing-assisted_5G_networks","334049829_High-dimensional_geometry_of_population_responses_in_visual_cortex","333175149_A_QoS-aware_virtual_machine_scheduling_method_for_energy_conservation_in_cloud-based_cyber-physical_systems","331683869_Task_Allocation_Model_Based_on_Worker_Friend_Relationship_for_Mobile_Crowdsourcing","329128709_A_caching_and_spatial_K-anonymity_driven_privacy_enhancement_scheme_in_continuous_location-based_services","327125651_Evaluating_Multi-Dimensional_Visualizations_for_Understanding_Fuzzy_Clusters","324752674_Privacy-Aware_Multidimensional_Mobile_Service_Quality_Prediction_and_Recommendation_in_Distributed_Fog_Environment","318184563_Adaptive_group_bridge_estimation_for_high-dimensional_partially_linear_models","275411612_A_k-anonymous_approach_to_privacy_preserving_collaborative_filtering","215642909_Selecting_Skyline_Services_for_QoS-based_Web_Service_Composition","339581428_Automated_Colorization_of_a_Grayscale_Image_With_Seed_Points_Propagation","339177444_Dynamic_resource_provisioning_for_workflow_scheduling_under_uncertainty_in_edge_computing_environment","337737974_Faster_R-CNN_for_Multi-class_Fruit_Detection_using_a_Robotic_Vision_System","337596698_Spatial-Temporal_Data-driven_Service_Recommendation_with_Privacy-preservation","336540225_Cognitive_computing_and_wireless_communications_on_the_edge_for_healthcare_service_robots","336343031_Multi-Modality_Behavioral_Influence_Analysis_for_Personalized_Recommendations_in_Health_Social_Media_Environment","336067620_Social_Recommendation_With_Large-Scale_Group_Decision-Making_for_Cyber-Enabled_Online_Service","335712428_An_Optimization_and_Auction-Based_Incentive_Mechanism_to_Maximize_Social_Welfare_for_Mobile_Crowdsourcing","335360205_Location-Aware_Deep_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Service_Recommendation","334723714_Stimulus-Driven_and_Concept-Driven_Analysis_for_Image_Caption_Generation","332928303_QoS_Prediction_for_Mobile_Edge_Service_Recommendation_With_Auto-Encoder","332482344_Adaptive_Fusion_and_Category-Level_Dictionary_Learning_Model_for_Multi-View_Human_Action_Recognition","330266049_Covering-Based_Web_Service_Quality_Prediction_via_Neighborhood-Aware_Matrix_Factorization","328948325_A_long_video_caption_generation_algorithm_for_big_video_data_retrieval","328307663_An_incentive_mechanism_for_crowdsourcing_markets_with_social_welfare_maximization_in_cloud-edge_computing","327735361_Multi-dimensional_data_indexing_and_range_query_processing_via_Voronoi_diagram_for_internet_of_things","326638505_Academic_Influence_Aware_and_Multidimensional_Network_Analysis_for_Research_Collaboration_Navigation_Based_on_Scholarly_Big_Data","325493590_A_Dual_Privacy_Preserving_Scheme_in_Continuous_Location-Based_Services","324811921_Efficient_Query_of_Quality_Correlation_for_Service_Composition","324496705_A_two-stage_locality-sensitive_hashing_based_approach_for_privacy-preserving_mobile_service_recommendation_in_cross-platform_edge_environment","323154093_Truthful_incentive_mechanism_with_location_privacy-preserving_for_mobile_crowdsourcing_systems","321041597_Integrating_Modified_Cuckoo_Algorithm_and_Creditability_Evaluation_for_QoS-Aware_Service_Composition","319231601_Bifurcation_of_periodic_orbits_by_perturbing_high-dimensional_piecewise_smooth_integrable_systems","317870852_Enhancing_privacy_through_uniform_grid_and_caching_in_location-based_services","308673316_A_Collaborative_Filtering_Method_for_Personalized_Preference-Based_Service_Recommendation","308048640_Thirteen_ways_to_look_at_the_correlation_coefficient","286490513_Enabling_Personalized_Search_over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data_with_Efficiency_Improvement","283431151_Hybrid_Collaborative_Filtering_For_High-Involvement_Products_A_Solution_to_Opinion_Sparsity_and_Dynamics","283281132_Periodic_orbits_in_3-dimensional_systems_and_application_to_a_perturbed_Volterra_system","276368901_A_Secure_and_Dynamic_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_Scheme_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data","272752152_A_Privacy-Preserving_QoS_Prediction_Framework_for_Web_Service_Recommendation","270773543_HireSome-II_Towards_Privacy-Aware_Cross-Cloud_Service_Composition_for_Big_Data_Applications","223039251_Evaluation_of_hazardous_waste_transportation_firms_by_using_a_two_step_fuzzy-AHP_and_TOPSIS_methodology","220422047_Using_collaborative_filtering_to_weave_an_information_TAPESTRY"]}
