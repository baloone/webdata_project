{"id":"332886780_The_Impact_of_Children's_Long-Term_Participation_in_STEM_Clubs_on_Their_Attitudes_towards_STEM_Subjects","abstract":"In this report, we investigated the impact of after-school STEM clubs on children’s attitudes to STEM-related subjects. 236 children aged 8-12 took part in this study. For the purpose of this study, a quantitative research method was adopted where a survey prior to the STEM activities and at the end of 30 weeks of the after-school club have been used to make sense of children’s perspectives on STEM-related subjects. The study also explored whether the age and gender of the children would influence their attitudes towards these subjects.Keywords: STEM, Engineering, Cross-curricular, Computer Science, Primary education","authors":["Cem Kagar","Teslime Kagar"],"meta":["May 2019International Journal of Computer Science Education in Schools","DOI:10.21585/ijcses.v0i0.51"],"references":["305418293_A_conceptual_framework_for_integrated_STEM_education","286200999_Advancing_STEM_education_A_2020_vision","283735575_Integrated_stem_education","273458545_Implementation_and_integration_of_engineering_in_K-12_STEM_education","220041633_Integrative_learning_for_liberal_education"]}
