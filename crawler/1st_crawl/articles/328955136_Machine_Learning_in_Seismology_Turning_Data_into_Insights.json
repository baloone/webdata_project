{"id":"328955136_Machine_Learning_in_Seismology_Turning_Data_into_Insights","abstract":"This article provides an overview of current applications of machine learning (ML) in seismology. ML techniques are becoming increasingly widespread in seismology, with applications ranging from identifying unseen signals and patterns to extracting features that might improve our physical understanding. The survey of the applications in seismology presented here serves as a catalyst for further use of ML. Five research areas in seismology are surveyed in which ML classification, regression, clustering algorithms show promise: earthquake detection and phase picking, earthquake early warning (EEW), ground‐motion prediction, seismic tomography, and earthquake geodesy. We conclude by discussing the need for a hybrid approach combining data‐driven ML with traditional physical modeling.","authors":["Qingkai Kong","Daniel Trugman","Zachary E. Ross","Michael J.
