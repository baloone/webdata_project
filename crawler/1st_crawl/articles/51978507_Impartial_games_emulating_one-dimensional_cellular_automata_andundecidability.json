{"id":"51978507_Impartial_games_emulating_one-dimensional_cellular_automata_andundecidability","abstract":"We study two-player \\emph{take-away} games whose outcomes emulate two-state\none-dimensional cellular automata, such as Wolfram's rules 60 and 110. Given an\ninitial string consisting of a central data pattern and periodic left and right\npatterns, the rule 110 cellular automaton was recently proved Turing-complete\nby Matthew Cook. Hence, many questions regarding its behavior are\nalgorithmically undecidable. We show that similar questions are undecidable for\nour \\emph{rule 110} game.","authors":["Urban Larsson"],"meta":["January 2012Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 120(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcta.2013.02.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["292703630_Take-away_games_games_of_no_chance","268200900_Universality_in_Elementary_Cellular_Automata","266439036_Take-away_games","250763903_A_mathematical_investigation_of_games_of_take-away","248071225_Theory_and_Applications_of_Cellular_Automata","239060186_Cellular_Automata_and_Complexity","236577756_A_new_Kind_of_Science","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","222437704_Universality_and_complexity_in_cellular_automata","220481184_A_Concrete_View_of_Rule_110_Computation"]}
