The-Expansion method is simple and powerful analyzed for getting some sets of exact solutions. To develop the theory and to visualize the graph, the mathematical software MAPLE was used. This method also gives us various kind of heat and wave equations which are implemented not only various types of heat and wave equation but also take a good decision from figure.","authors":["Muhammad Minarul Islam","Mohammad Sanjeed Hasan"],"meta":["October 2018African Journal of Mathematics and Computer Science Research 11(7):103-108","DOI:10.5897/AJMCSR2016.0643"],"references":["272657783_The_Basic_G'G_-Expansion_Method_for_the_Fourth_Order_Boussinesq_Equation","268524439_Study_of_exp-PHx-expansion_Method_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Partial_Differential_Equations","267131108_The_solution_of_TRLW_and_Gardner_Equations_by_the_G'G-Expansion_Method","265088873_Solution_of_Singular_Equation_by_He's_Variational_Iteration_Method","306150602_Homotopy_perturbation_method_for_solving_fourth-order_boundary_value_problems_Math_Prob_Eng_vol_2007","285112339_Exact_complexiton_soliton_solutions_for_nonlinear_partial_differential_equations_in_mathematical_physics","281688933_Traveling_wave_solutions_for_the_nonlinear_evolution_equation_via_the_generalized_riccati_equation_and_the_G'G-expansion_method","269864036_Exact_Solutions_of_the_BBM_and_MBBM_Equations_by_the_Generalized_G'G_-expansion_Method_Equations","265127820_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_of_Seventh-order_Generalized_KdV_Equations_Using_He's_Polynomials","264993307_Exact_solutions_of_the_modified_BBM_equation_by_modified_exp-function_method","259850754_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_Of_Nonlinear_Evolution_Equation_Via_Enhanced","259169413_Exact_and_solitary_wave_solutions_for_the_Tzitzeica-Dodd-Bullough_and_the_modified_KdV-Zakharov-Kuznetsov_equations_using_the_modified_simple_equation_method","259166043_Application_of_the_G'G-expansion_method_for_the_generalized_Fisher's_equation_and_modified_equal_width_equation","260869871_Enhanced_'-Expansion_Method_to_Find_the_Exact_Complexiton_Soliton_Solutions_of_31-Dimensional_Zakhrov-_Kuznetsov_Equation","259017543_Solitary_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_wave_equations"]}
