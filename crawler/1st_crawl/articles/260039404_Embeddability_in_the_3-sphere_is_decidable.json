{"id":"260039404_Embeddability_in_the_3-sphere_is_decidable","abstract":"We show that the following algorithmic problem is decidable: given a\n$2$-dimensional simplicial complex, can it be embedded (topologically, or\nequivalently, piecewise linearly) in $\\mathbf{R}^3$? By a known reduction, it\nsuffices to decide the embeddability of a given triangulated 3-manifold $X$\ninto the 3-sphere $S^3$. The main step, which allows us to simplify $X$ and\nrecurse, is in proving that if $X$ can be embedded in $S^3$, then there is also\nan embedding in which $X$ has a short meridian, i.e., an essential curve in the\nboundary of $X$ bounding a disk in $S^3\\setminus X$ with length bounded by a\ncomputable function of the number of tetrahedra of $X$.","authors":["Jiří Matoušek","Eric Sedgwick","Martin Tancer","Uli Wagner"],"meta":["February 2014","DOI:10.1145/2582112.2582137","SourcearXiv"],"references":["346674079_Almost_normal_surfaces_in_3-manifolds","344808504_A_Primer_on_Mapping_Class_Groups","344082978_The_computational_complexity_of_knot_genus_and_spanning_area","312750990_An_algorithm_to_recognize_the_3-sphere","306221715_Simplical_structures_of_knot_complements","303499030_Untangling_two_systems_of_noncrossing_curves","303490043_Knots_are_determined_by_their_complements","282715380_Classifications_of_sufficiently_large_3-manifolds","280173086_Polynomial-Time_Computation_of_Homotopy_Groups_and_Postnikov_Systems_in_Fixed_Dimension","267050078_Introduction_to_piecewise-linear_topology_Rev_printing_of_Ergebnisse_der_Mathematik_und_ihrer_Grenzgebiete_Vol_69_1972"]}
