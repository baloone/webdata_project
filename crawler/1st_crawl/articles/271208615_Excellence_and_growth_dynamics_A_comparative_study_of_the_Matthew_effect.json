{"id":"271208615_Excellence_and_growth_dynamics_A_comparative_study_of_the_Matthew_effect","abstract":"In the past two decades, centres of excellence (CoE) and other ‘research excellence initiatives’ likely to increase the cumulative\nadvantages and stratification of science, have been implemented in many countries. Based on empirical studies of CoE in four\nNordic countries, this paper examines how the resources provided by CoE schemes (generous long-term funding, prestige and\nvisibility) add to the success and growth dynamics of the CoE. The data indicate a modified Matthew effect with ceilings and\nlimits avoiding excessive accumulation of resources. Important impacts of the CoE are found, in particular in terms of enabling\nmore interdisciplinary collaboration and risk-taking and enhancing international recruitment to the research areas involved.\nBut, in contrast to what might be expected, the CoE grant seem to add less to the relative citation rate of those already\nperforming at the highest level, than for those performing at a somewhat lower level prior to the CoE grant.","authors":["Liv Langfeldt","Mats Benner","Gunnar Sivertsen","Ernst H.
