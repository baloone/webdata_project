And since human learning and development are the cornerstones of educational goals, the domains contributing to educational research rest on a vast number of areas, including in the following fields: learning sciences and cognitive science (psychology and neuroscience [behaviour and brain processes]); computer science (computer-based learning systems, learning analytics); economics; and social sciences (the learner and their broader context).","authors":["Julien Mercier","Iris Bourgault-Bouthillier"],"meta":["July 2021","Project: NeuroLab - the educational neuroscience lab at UQAM"],"references":["326456285_An_overview_of_realist_evaluation_for_simulation-based_education","326275066_The_trials_of_evidence-based_practice_in_education_a_systematic_review_of_randomised_controlled_trials_in_education_research_1980-2016","321256036_Policymakers'_experience_of_a_capacity-building_intervention_designed_to_increase_their_use_of_research_A_realist_process_evaluation","319021810_Publication_Bias_in_Special_Education_Meta-Analyses","310037919_The_Science_of_Using_Science_Researching_the_Use_of_Research_Evidence_in_Decision-Making_Technical_Report","309734926_Interprofessional_education_in_a_student-led_emergency_department_A_realist_evaluation","334891302_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Research_and_Practice_Predicting_What_Will_Work_Locally","333786314_The_key_role_of_representativeness_in_evidence-based_education","333630776_How_Evidence-Based_Reform_Will_Transform_Research_and_Practice_in_Education","301790537_What_Constitutes_Good_Evidence_for_Public_Health_and_Social_Policy-making_From_Hierarchies_to_Appropriateness","51860563_Realist_methods_in_medical_education_research_What_are_they_and_what_can_they_contribute","276054426_Trends_in_Theory_Building_and_Theory_Testing_A_Five-Decade_Study_of_the_Academy_of_Management_Journal","266731427_Realistic_Evaluation","233441333_Cutting_the_Gordian_Knot_of_Demarcation","51246144_The_Levels_of_Evidence_and_Their_Role_in_Evidence-Based_Medicine"]}
