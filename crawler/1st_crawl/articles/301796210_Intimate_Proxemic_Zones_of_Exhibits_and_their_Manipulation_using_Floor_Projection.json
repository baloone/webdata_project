{"id":"301796210_Intimate_Proxemic_Zones_of_Exhibits_and_their_Manipulation_using_Floor_Projection","abstract":"Today, more and more exhibitions contain interactivity. We investigate intimate proxemic zones of exhibits, which are zones that visitor will not enter. In a first experiment we show that exhibits have, like humans, an intimate proxemic zone that is respected by exhibition visitors and which is 27cm. Such zone that visitors will not enter can be increased through lines projected on the floor. In a second experiment we showed that for distances larger than 95cm, static lines will not protect the intimate zone of the exhibit anymore, but animated or color changing lines will do and allow for dynamically changing the zone size. This paper provides fundamental insight in intimate proxemic zones of exhibits and about how we can use interactive floor projections to manipulate these zones in the context of exhibitions. That can be used, for example, to increase the safety zone of exhibits if the room is crowded.","authors":["Katrin Wolf","Yomna Abdelrahman","Thomas Kubitza","Albrecht Schmidt"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2914920.2915012","Conference: The Fifth ACM International Symposium on Pervasive Displays"],"references":["289032527_RoomAlive","266391872_RoomAlive_Magical_Experiences_Enabled_by_Scalable_Adaptive_Projector-Camera_Units","262409530_IllumiRoom_peripheral_projected_illusions_for_interactive_experiences","226411202_Crossmodal_Ambient_Displays","221572607_Requirements_and_design_space_for_interactive_public_displays","221568612_Ambient_influence_Can_twinkly_lights_lure_and_abstract_representations_trigger_behavioral_change","221540146_Proxemic_Interaction_Designing_for_a_Proximity_and_Orientation-Aware_Environment","238047580_The_Effect_of_Lighting_Conditions_on_Personal_Space_Requirements","235361607_The_Hidden_Dimension","227992823_Space_Syntax"]}
