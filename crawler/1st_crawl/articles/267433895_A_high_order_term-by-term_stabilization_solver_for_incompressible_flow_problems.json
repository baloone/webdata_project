{"id":"267433895_A_high_order_term-by-term_stabilization_solver_for_incompressible_flow_problems","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a low-cost, high-order stabilized method for the numerical solution of incompressible flow problems.\nThis is a particular type of projection-stabilized method where each targeted operator, such as the pressure gradient or the\nconvection, is stabilized by least-squares terms added to the Galerkin formulation. The main methodological originality is\nthat we replace the projection-stabilized structure by an interpolation-stabilized structure, with reduced computational cost\nfor some choices of the interpolation operator. This stabilization has one level, in the sense that it is defined on a single\nmesh. We prove the stability of our formulation by means of a specific inf–sup condition, which is the main technical innovation\nof our paper. We perform a convergence and error estimates analysis, proving the optimal order of accuracy of our method.\nWe include some numerical tests that confirm our theoretical expectations.","authors":["Tomás Chacón Rebollo","Macarena Gómez Mármol","V.
