{"id":"330356792_Information_searching_and_search_models","abstract":"The emergence of the Internet has created millions of end-users who search for information themselves. Information searching can be defined as users’ purposive behaviors in finding relevant or useful information in their interactions with information retrieval (IR) systems. Despite their different foci, information searching can also be used as synonymous for IR, information-seeking, and information access.[1] While information-seeking refers to purposive behavior involving users’ interactions with either manual or computer-based information systems in order to satisfy their information goals, information-searching refers to the microlevel of behavior when interacting with different types of information systems.[2] IR is also a broad concept similar to information seeking, but is more limited to users’ interactions with computer-based information systems. Since research on information-seeking and IR has contributed significantly to research on information searching, some of the associated works are also reflected here.","authors":["I.
