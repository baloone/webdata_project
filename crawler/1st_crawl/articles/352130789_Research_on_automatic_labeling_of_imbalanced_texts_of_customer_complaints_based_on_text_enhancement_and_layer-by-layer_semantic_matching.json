{"id":"352130789_Research_on_automatic_labeling_of_imbalanced_texts_of_customer_complaints_based_on_text_enhancement_and_layer-by-layer_semantic_matching","abstract":"Due to its potential impact on business efficiency, automated customer complaint labeling and classification are of great importance for management decision making and business applications. The majority of the current research on automated labeling uses large and well-balanced datasets. However, customer complaint labels are hierarchical in structure, with many labels at the lowest hierarchy level. Relying on lower-level labels leads to small and imbalanced samples, thus rendering the current automatic labeling practices inapplicable to customer complaints. This article proposes an automatic labeling model incorporating the BERT and word2vec methods. The model is validated on electric utility customer complaint data. Within the model, the BERT method serves to obtain shallow text tags. Furthermore, text enhancement is used to mitigate the problem of imbalanced samples that emerge when the number of labels is large. Finally, the word2vec model is utilized for deep text analysis. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's efficiency in automating customer complaint labeling. Consequently, the proposed model supports enterprises in improving their service quality while simultaneously reducing labor costs.","authors":["Xiaobo Tang","Hao Mou","Jiangnan Liu","Xin Du"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91189-0"],"references":["343958685_Text_Augmentation_Using_BERT_for_Image_Captioning","340383721_Word2vec-based_latent_semantic_analysis_W2V-LSA_for_topic_modeling_A_study_on_blockchain_technology_trend_analysis","336999574_Cost-Sensitive_BERT_for_Generalisable_Sentence_Classification_on_Imbalanced_Data","316028143_Automatic_Keyword_Extraction_for_Text_Summarization_A_Survey","344127383_Automatic_and_Explainable_Labeling_of_Medical_Event_Logs_With_Autoencoding","340357111_A_novel_architecture_Using_convolutional_neural_networks_for_Kansei_attributes_automatic_evaluation_and_labeling","338167829_Multiclass_Imbalanced_Learning_with_One-Versus-One_Decomposition_and_Spectral_Clustering","337209304_A_Hybrid_Imbalanced_Data_Learning_Framework_to_tackle_Opinion_Imbalance_in_Movie_Reviews","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","2534308_Automatic_Indexing_of_Documents_With_Ontologies","224105274_A_Statistical_Approach_to_Mechanized_Encoding_and_Searching_of_Literary_Information","222746112_Experiments_in_Automatic_Indexing_and_Extracting","200773081_A_Vector_Space_Model_for_Automatic_Indexing"]}
