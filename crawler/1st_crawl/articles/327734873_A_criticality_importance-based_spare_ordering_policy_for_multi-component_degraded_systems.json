{"id":"327734873_A_criticality_importance-based_spare_ordering_policy_for_multi-component_degraded_systems","abstract":"With the increasing complexity and variety of production systems, more attention is being paid to preventive replacement on multicomponent systems. Each component is non-identical and has its own degradation process. In this paper, we propose a criticality importance-based spare ordering policy for a complex system, which consists of multiple series-parallel degrading components. Replacement action is triggered whenever the system reliability drops below a lower threshold and spares for replacement are available. Our policy mainly consists of two steps: (1) determine which components to be replaced; (2) determine when to order spares for components selected. In step 1, when the replacement action is triggered, we select components that most need to be replaced within the system in accordance with the optimum ranking of components until the system meets an upper reliability threshold. In step 2, a spare ordering policy for components selected is made and the optimal spare ordering time is obtained by minimizing the expected replacement cost during the once replacement cycle. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed multi-spare ordering policy. Moreover, the proposed policy is of significance for safety-critical systems such as substation automation system, bridge system, nuclear power plants and aerospace equipment.
