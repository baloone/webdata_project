{"id":"286513583_A_Randomized_Polynomial_Kernel_for_Subset_Feedback_Vertex_Set","abstract":"The Subset Feedback Vertex Set problem generalizes the classical Feedback\nVertex Set problem and asks, for a given undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\n\\subseteq V$, and an integer $k$, whether there exists a set $X$ of at most $k$\nvertices such that no cycle in $G-X$ contains a vertex of $S$. It was\nindependently shown by Cygan et al. (ICALP '11, SIDMA '13) and Kawarabayashi\nand Kobayashi (JCTB '12) that Subset Feedback Vertex Set is fixed-parameter\ntractable for parameter $k$. Cygan et al. asked whether the problem also admits\na polynomial kernelization.\nWe answer the question of Cygan et al. positively by giving a randomized\npolynomial kernelization for the equivalent version where $S$ is a set of\nedges. In a first step we show that Edge Subset Feedback Vertex Set has a\nrandomized polynomial kernel parameterized by $|S|+k$ with $O(|S|^2k)$\nvertices. For this we use the matroid-based tools of Kratsch and Wahlstr\\\"om\n(FOCS '12) that for example were used to obtain a polynomial kernel for\n$s$-Multiway Cut. Next we present a preprocessing that reduces the given\ninstance $(G,S,k)$ to an equivalent instance $(G',S',k')$ where the size of\n$S'$ is bounded by $O(k^4)$. These two results lead to a polynomial kernel for\nSubset Feedback Vertex Set with $O(k^9)$ vertices.","authors":["Eva-Maria C.
