{"id":"310049600_Verigraph_A_System_for_Specification_and_Analysis_of_Graph_Grammars","abstract":"Graph grammars are models that allow for a visual representation of both static and dynamic aspects of a system. There are several tools that allow the edition, simulation and analysis of graph grammars, each of them focusing on one kind of analysis technique or graph model. In this paper we present a new tool for simulation and analysis of graph grammars, called Verigraph, built with the following design principles: an implementation as direct as possible of formal concepts (to ease correctness arguments), a generic implementation of core algorithms (to allow its application for several graph models), and a reasonable running time. In this paper we present architectural aspects of Verigraph, together with a comparison with other similar tools in terms of available features.","authors":["Andrei Costa","Jonas Santos Bezerra","Guilherme Azzi","Leonardo Marques Rodrigues"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49815-7_5","Conference: Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods"],"references":["272200256_Rule-based_transformation_of_graph_rewriting_rules_Towards_higher-order_graph_grammars","268452099_AGREE_--_Algebraic_Graph_Rewriting_with_Controlled_Embedding_Long_Version","239580441_Handbook_of_Graph_Grammars_and_Computing_by_Graph_Transformation","221241290_Type_checking_with_open_type_functions","221116940_The_GROOVE_simulator_A_tool_for_state_space_generation","220713448_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_-_Part_II_Single_Pushout_Approach_and_Comparison_with_Double_Pushout_Approach","220713369_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","215610329_Fundamentals_of_Algebraic_Graph_Transformation","2819092_Graph_Grammars_with_Negative_Application_Conditions","2719249_Logic_in_Computer_Science_Modelling_and_Reasoning_About_Systems","307960239_Certifying_Rule-Based_Models_using_Graph_Transformation","242504126_Handbook_of_Graph_Grammars_and_Computing_by_Graph_Transformations_Volume_1_Foundations","232644595_Graph-Grammars_An_Algebraic_Approach","220713216_Conflict_Detection_for_Graph_Transformation_with_Negative_Application_Conditions","41032017_Certifying_Rule-Based_Models_using_Graph_Transformation","4175682_Benchmarking_for_graph_transformation","2468045_AGG_A_Tool_Environment_for_Algebraic_Graph_Transformation"]}
