{"id":"265383699_Iterative_deblending_of_simultaneous-source_seismic_data_using_seislet-domain_shaping_regularization","abstract":"We used a novel iterative estimation scheme for separa-\ntion of blended seismic data from simultaneous sources. The\nscheme is based on an augmented estimation problem that\ncan be solved by iteratively constraining the deblended data\nusing shaping regularization in the seislet domain. We for-\nmulated the forward modeling operator in the common-\nreceiver domain, in which two sources were assumed to\nbe blended using a random time-shift dithering approach.\nThe nonlinear shaping-regularization framework offered\nsome freedom in designing a shaping operator to constrain\nthe model in an underdetermined inverse problem. We de-\nsigned the backward operator and the shaping operator\nfor the shaping-regularization framework. The backward\noperator can be optimally chosen as half of the identity\noperator in the two-source case, and the shaping operator\ncan be chosen as coherency-promoting operator. The high\nperformance deblending effect of the iterative framework\nwas tested on three numerically blended synthetic data sets\nand one numerically blended field data set. Compared with\nalternative f‐k domain thresholding and f‐x predictive filter-\ning, seislet-domain soft thresholding exhibits the most ro-\nbust behavior.","authors":["Yangkang Chen","Sergey Fomel","Jingwei Hu"],"meta":["August 2014Geophysics 79(5):V179-V189","DOI:10.1190/GEO2013-0449.1","Projects: Reproducible researchSimultaneous source acquisition"],"references":["265873450_Beyond_alias_hierarchical_scale_curvelet_interpolation_of_regularly_and_irregularly_sampled_seismic_data","265383769_Imaging_incomplete_data_and_simultaneous-source_data_using_least-squares_reverse-time_migration_with_shaping_regularization","341010995_Sparse_Inversion_of_Simultaneous_Sources","285689852_High_Quality_Separation_of_Simultaneous_Sources_by_Sparse_Inversion","279969997_Changing_the_mindset_in_seismic_acquisition","269065181_Nonlinear_shaping_regularization_in_geophysical_inverse_problems","268455155_Improved_POCS_interpolation_using_a_percentage_thresholding_strategy_and_excessively_zero-padded_FFT","268455063_FX_plus_deconvolution_for_seismic_data_noise_reduction","268454190_An_Overview_of_BP's_Marine_Independent_Simultaneous_Source_field_trials","263720801_Attenuating_crosstalk_noise_with_simultaneous_source_full_waveform_inversion"]}
