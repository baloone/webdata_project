{"id":"299743077_Computer_Aided_Disease_Detection_System_for_Gastrointestinal_Examinations","abstract":"In this paper, we present the computer-aided diagnosis part of the EIR system [9], which can support medical experts in the task of detecting diseases and anatomical landmarks in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. This includes automatic detection of important findings in colonoscopy videos and marking them for the doctors. EIR is designed in a modular way so that it can easily be extended for other diseases. For this demonstration, we will focus on polyp detection, as our system is trained with the ASU-Mayo Clinic polyp database [5].","authors":["Michael Alexander Riegler","Konstantin Pogorelov","Jonas Markussen","Mathias Lux"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1145/2910017.2910629","Conference: Multimedia Systems Conference 2016"],"references":["299743075_Device_Lending_in_PCI_Express_Networks","299742994_GPU-Accelerated_Real-Time_Gastrointestinal_Diseases_Detection","264863264_Abnormal_Image_Detection_in_Endoscopy_Videos_Using_a_Filter_Bank_and_Local_Binary_Patterns","299742993_Explorative_Hyperbolic-Tree-Based_Clustering_Tool_for_Unsupervised_Knowledge_Discovery","299742992_Efficient_Processing_of_Videos_in_a_Multi_Auditory_Environment_Using_Device_Lending_of_GPUs","299742899_EIR_-_Efficient_Computer_Aided_Diagnosis_Framework_for_Gastrointestinal_Endoscopies","275366376_Polyp-Alert_Near_Real-time_Feedback_during_Colonoscopy","272008845_Expert_Driven_Semi-Supervised_Elucidation_Tool_for_Medical_Endoscopic_Videos","233799034_Near_Real-Time_Retroflexion_Detection_in_Colonoscopy","224605582_Detection_of_Quality_Visualization_of_Appendiceal_Orifices_Using_Local_Edge_Cross-Section_Profile_Features_and_Near_Pause_Detection","221318828_Late_fusion_of_heterogeneous_methods_for_multimedia_image_retrieval","224255258_Computer-aided_detection_of_retroflexion_in_colonoscopy","221573136_Content_based_image_retrieval_with_LIRe"]}
