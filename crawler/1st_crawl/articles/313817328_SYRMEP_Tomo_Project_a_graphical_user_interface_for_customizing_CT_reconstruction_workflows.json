{"id":"313817328_SYRMEP_Tomo_Project_a_graphical_user_interface_for_customizing_CT_reconstruction_workflows","abstract":"When considering the acquisition of experimental synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray CT data, the reconstruction workflow cannot be limited to the essential computational steps of flat fielding and filtered back projection (FBP). More refined image processing is often required, usually to compensate artifacts and enhance the quality of the reconstructed images. In principle, it would be desirable to optimize the reconstruction workflow at the facility during the experiment (beamtime). However, several practical factors affect the image reconstruction part of the experiment and users are likely to conclude the beamtime with sub-optimal reconstructed images. Through an example of application, this article presents SYRMEP Tomo Project (STP), an open-source software tool conceived to let users design custom CT reconstruction workflows. STP has been designed for post-beamtime (off-line use) and for a new reconstruction of past archived data at userâ€™s home institution where simple computing resources are available. Releases of the software can be downloaded at the Elettra Scientific Computing group GitHub repository https://github.com/ElettraSciComp/STP-Gui.","authors":["Francesco Brun","Lorenzo Massimi","Michela Fratini","Diego Dreossi"],"meta":["January 2017Advanced Structural and Chemical Imaging 3(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40679-016-0036-8"],"references":["308000054_Corrigendum_Virtual_unrolling_and_deciphering_of_Herculaneum_papyri_by_X-ray_phase-contrast_tomography","301854694_Enhanced_X-ray-phase-contrast-tomography_brings_new_clarity_to_the_2000-year-old_'voice'_of_Epicurean_philosopher_Philodemus","301741906_Integration_of_TomoPy_and_the_ASTRA_toolbox_for_advanced_processing_and_reconstruction_of_tomographic_synchrotron_data","292949004_Towards_breast_tomography_with_synchrotron_radiation_at_Elettra_First_images","283011407_Dynamic_intensity_normalization_using_eigen_flat_fields_in_X-ray_imaging","312941403_Simultaneous_submicrometric_3D_imaging_of_the_micro-vascular_network_and_the_neuronal_system_in_a_mouse_spinal_cord","304040014_Simultaneous_submicrometric_3D_imaging_of_the_micro-vascular_network_and_the_neuronal_system_in_a_mouse_spinal_cord","283468435_Enhanced_and_Flexible_Software_Tools_for_X-ray_Computed_Tomography_at_the_Italian_Synchrotron_Radiation_Facility_Elettra","281342544_Clinical_application_of_low-dose_phase_contrast_breast_CT_Methods_for_the_optimization_of_the_reconstruction_workflow","276075085_The_ASTRA_Toolbox_A_platform_for_advanced_algorithm_development_in_electron_tomography"]}
