{"id":"339052960_Machine_Learning_for_Pulmonary_and_Critical_Care_Medicine_A_Narrative_Review","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science in which statistical methods are applied to data in order to classify, predict, or optimize, based on previously observed data. Pulmonary and critical care medicine have seen a surge in the application of this methodology, potentially delivering improvements in our ability to diagnose, treat, and better understand a multitude of disease states. Here we review the literature and provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in ML as applied to these areas of medicine. In addition, we discuss both the significant benefits of this work as well as the challenges in the implementation and acceptance of this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes.","authors":["Eric Mlodzinski","David J Stone","Leo A.
