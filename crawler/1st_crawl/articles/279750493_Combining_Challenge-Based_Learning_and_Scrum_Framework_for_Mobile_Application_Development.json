{"id":"279750493_Combining_Challenge-Based_Learning_and_Scrum_Framework_for_Mobile_Application_Development","abstract":"The market for mobile applications has been growing dramatically, as has the complexity of the applications and the speed of the development process. These changes require a rethinking of the development process and of how developers are trained. In order to better prepare faculty and students for the emerging mobile application market, this study presents a new learning and software development framework that combines Agile methodologies with the Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) framework. CBL provides a student-centered learning framework that mirrors the modern workplace. Agile methodologies address the changing landscape of mobile development environments. A combination of the CBL learning framework and Agile methodologies can better prepare students for the development market. This paper presents an empirical study applying CBL and Scrum in a mobile application development course evaluated through a series of post surveys. The results indicate that a teaching and learning environment based on practical experience combining the CBL framework with the Scrum process is an effective model to promptly teach undergraduates how to be successful mobile application developers.","authors":["Alan R.
