{"id":"267089975_Goofspiel_The_Game_of_Pure_Strategy","abstract":"The game of pure strategy, sometimes called Goofspiel or Gops (see [2] and [3]), is played by two players, using a normal deck of cards, as follows. The 13 clubs are first taken out of the deck and of the remaining 39 cards the 13 hearts are given to Player I, the 13 diamonds to Player II, and the 13 spades are placed face down in the center. The spades are shuffled and one is turned face up. At this point, the two players choose one of their cards and then simultaneously discard it. The one who discards the higher card (ace being low, king high) wins from the other an amount equal to the value of the upturned spade (ace = 1, king = 13). If both players discard the same card, then neither wins. The three cards are then thrown away, a new spade upturned and the game continues. After 13 plays, there are no remaining cards and the game ends.","authors":["Sheldon M.
