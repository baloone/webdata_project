{"id":"299524183_Biomimetic_Hybrid_Feedback_Feedforward_Neural-Network_Learning_Control","abstract":"This brief presents a biomimetic hybrid feedback feedforward neural-network learning control (NNLC) strategy inspired by the human motor learning control mechanism for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. The control structure includes a proportional-derivative controller acting as a feedback servo machine and a radial-basis-function (RBF) NN acting as a feedforward predictive machine. Under the sufficient constraints on control parameters, the closed-loop system achieves semiglobal practical exponential stability, such that an accurate NN approximation is guaranteed in a local region along recurrent reference traj- ectories. Compared with the existing NNLC methods, the novelties of the proposed method include: 1) the implementation of an adaptive NN control to guarantee plant states being recurrent is not needed, since recurrent reference signals rather than plant states are utilized as NN inputs, which greatly simplifies the analysis and synthesis of the NNLC and 2) the domain of NN approximation can be determined a priori by the given reference signals, which leads to an easy construction of the RBF-NNs. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of this approach.","authors":["Yongping Pan","Haoyong Yu"],"meta":["March 2016IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems 28(6):1-7","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2527501"],"references":["262149090_Reinforcement_Learning_Output_Feedback_NN_Control_Using_Deterministic_Learning_Technique","238877237_Persistency_of_Excitation_in_Identification_Using_Radial_Basis_Function_Approximants","220183393_Heads_up_Biomechanics_modeling_and_neuromuscular_control_of_the_neck","7252838_Learning_From_Neural_Control","288020956_Hybrid_feedback_feedforward_An_efficient_design_of_adaptive_neural_network_control","282907139_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Identification_and_Control_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Pure-Feedback_MIMO_Systems_With_Unknown_Dead_Zones","281221531_A_Fuzzy-Neural_Adaptive_Terminal_Iterative_Learning_Control_for_Fed-Batch_Fermentation_Processes","278672927_Biomimetic_hybrid_feedback_feedforward_adaptive_neural_control_of_robotic_arms","277658959_Fuzzy_Approximation-Based_Adaptive_Backstepping_Optimal_Control_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Systems_With_Dead-Zone","275431602_Learning_from_adaptive_neural_control_with_predefined_performance_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems","274139516_Adaptive_Neural_Network_Control_of_a_Compact_Bionic_Handling_Arm","273833710_Peaking-Free_Output-Feedback_Adaptive_Neural_Control_Under_a_Nonseparation_Principle","268794444_Adaptive_Neural_PD_Control_With_Semiglobal_Asymptotic_Stabilization_Guarantee","266378213_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Systems_With_Backlash","264461114_Neural_adaptive_robust_output_feedback_control_of_wheeled_mobile_robots_with_saturating_actuators","262148661_Decentralized_Stabilization_for_a_Class_of_Continuous-Time_Nonlinear_Interconnected_Systems_Using_Online_Learning_Optimal_Control_Approach","260912117_Adaptive_neural_network-based_optimal_control_of_nonlinear_continuous-time_systems_in_strict-feedback_form","260354317_Dynamic_Learning_From_Adaptive_Neural_Network_Control_of_a_Class_of_Nonaffine_Nonlinear_Systems","260354193_Learning_From_ISS-Modular_Adaptive_NN_Control_of_Nonlinear_Strict-Feedback_Systems","259452329_Adaptive_Optimal_Control_of_Unknown_Constrained-Input_Systems_Using_Policy_Iteration_and_Neural_Networks","257392463_Adaptive_neural_complementary_sliding-mode_control_via_functional-linked_wavelet_neural_network","257351951_Composite_adaptive_fuzzy_H_tracking_control_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems","223034792_Learning_from_neural_control_of_nonlinear_systems_in_normal_form","222205369_Persistence_of_excitation_conditions_in_passive_learning_control","221936165_Adaptive_Approximation_Based_Control-Unifying_Neural_Fuzzy_and_Traditional_Adaptive_Approximation_Approaches","23872387_Adaptive_Control_Stability_Convergence_and_Robustness","23387245_Shared_Internal_Models_for_Feedforward_and_Feedback_Control","7349205_Contribution_of_Feedback_and_Feedforward_Strategies_to_Locomotor_Adaptations","5596176_Use_of_an_artificial_neuroadaptive_robot_model_to_describe_adaptive_and_learning_motor_mechanisms_in_the_central_nervous_system","3304097_Adaptive_Approximation_Based_Control_Unifying_Neural_Fuzzy_and_Traditional_Adaptive_Approximation_Approaches","3302495_Stability_and_approximator_convergence_in_nonparametric_nonlinear_adaptive_control","3302456_Robust_nonlinear_system_identification_using_neural-network_models","3302032_On_the_Persistency_of_Excitation_in_Radial_Basis_Function_Network_Identificaiton_of_Nonlinear_Systems","3206379_Intelligent_Learning_Control","3031877_A_Continuous_Asymptotic_Tracking_Control_Strategy_for_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Systems","2984901_Neural_Networks_for_Control_Theory_and_Practice"]}
