The cement industry faces many problems that contain reducing fossil fuel, lack of raw resources, continuously increasing requests for cement, rising ecological alarms connected with temperature change. Iranian cement companies, despite copious profits such as valuable mines, face many challenges. Difficulties such as ill use of the manufacturing capacity require investigating to this extent. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the Eco-efficiency determining factor in five different developing countries 22 cement companies over 2015-2019 with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). To find the superior model CCR-DEA (or Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes model), BBC-DEA (or Banker, Charnes and Cooper model) and additive DEA model for measuring the efficiency of decision processes are used. After applying the proposed model, the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is computed to evaluate the productivity of companies over 2015-2019. Finally, the results indicate that FDH model has the most productive results during all periods compare with other suggested models since it has outstanding effects on both inputs and output.","authors":["Fatemeh Jafari Golrokh","Gohar Azeem","Ahmar Hasan"],"meta":["November 2020"],"references":["343300055_A_Novel_Machine_Learning_Approach_Combined_with_Optimization_Models_for_Eco-Efficiency_Evaluation","343030743_Optimized_Wavelet-Based_Satellite_Image_De-Noising_With_Multi-Population_Differential_Evolution-Assisted_Harris_Hawks_Optimization_Algorithm","342862225_LDA-GA-SVM_improved_hepatocellular_carcinoma_prediction_through_dimensionality_reduction_and_genetically_optimized_support_vector_machine","341832614_Machine_learning_Clustering_Algorithms_Based_on_the_DEA_Optimization_Approach_for_Banking_System_in_Developing_Countries","341777130_A_Novel_Improved_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_Model_Based_on_SBM_and_FDH_Models","338621607_Presenting_an_expert_system_for_early_diagnosis_of_gastrointestinal_diseases","337405362_A_Feature-Driven_Decision_Support_System_for_Heart_Failure_Prediction_Based_on_ch_2_Statistical_Model_and_Gaussian_Naive_Bayes","336268733_A_New_Automatic_Method_for_Control_Chart_Patterns_Recognition_Based_on_ConvNet_and_Harris_Hawks_Meta_Heuristic_Optimization_Algorithm","335827055_Ranking_of_Heart_Hospitals_Using_Cross-Efficiency_and_Two-stage_DEA","335826889_Window_Analysis_Using_Two-stage_DEA_in_Heart_Hospitals","334780602_Reliable_Parkinson's_Disease_Detection_by_Analyzing_Handwritten_Drawings_Construction_of_an_Unbiased_Cascaded_Learning_System_Based_on_Feature_Selection_and_Adaptive_Boosting_Model","333706685_An_Adaptive_Multi-Layer_Botnet_Detection_Technique_Using_Machine_Learning_Classifiers","333244918_A_Novel_Optimal_Distributed_Generation_Planning_in_Distribution_Network_using_Cuckoo_Optimization_Algorithm","333128061_Control_of_Distributed_Generators_and_Direct_Harmonic_Voltage_Controlled_Active_Power_Filters_for_Accurate_Current_Sharing_and_Power_Quality_Improvement_in_Islanded_Microgrids","332869015_Presenting_a_Medical_Expert_System_for_Diagnosis_and_Treatment_of_Nephrolithiasis","332825336_An_Optimized_Stacked_Support_Vector_Machines_Based_Expert_System_for_the_Effective_Prediction_of_Heart_Failure","331276522_Developing_an_expert_system_for_diagnosing_liver_diseases","329044846_Eco-Efficiency_Evaluation_in_Two-Stage_Network_Structure_Case_Study_Cement_Companies","324978958_Control_chart_pattern_recognition_using_RBF_neural_network_with_new_training_algorithm_and_practical_features","321059174_Malmquist_Productivity_Index_Using_Two-stage_DEA_Model_in_Heart_Hospitals","317952833_Data_Mining_Apriori_Algorithm_for_Heart_Disease_Prediction","317952592_Heart_Disease_Prediction_with_Data_Mining_Clustering_Algorithms","344333669_Improving_Construction_and_Demolition_Waste_Collection_Service_in_an_Urban_Area_Using_a_Simheuristic_Approach_A_Case_Study_in_Sydney_Australia","331883402_Free_disposal_hull_efficiency_scores_of_units_with_network_structures","323243387_Survey_of_Image_De-noising_using_Wavelet_Transform_Combined_with_Thresholding_Functions","321197927_Thresholding_Neural_Network_TNN_with_Smooth_Sigmoid_Based_Shrinkage_SSBS_Function_for_Image_De-noising","321197919_Image_De-noising_using_Un-decimated_Wavelet_Transform_UWT_with_Soft_Thresholding_Technique","265852899_Total-factor_carbon_emission_performance_of_the_Chinese_transportation_industry_A_bootstrapped_non-radial_Malmquist_index_analysis","222443692_Measuring_The_Efficiency_of_Decision_Making_Units"]}
