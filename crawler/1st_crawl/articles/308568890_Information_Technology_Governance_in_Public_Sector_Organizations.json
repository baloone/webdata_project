{"id":"308568890_Information_Technology_Governance_in_Public_Sector_Organizations","abstract":"There is a huge paucity of empirical researches on Information Technology Governance (ITG) in public sector organizations even with the noticeable growing importance of IT in the public sector through several IT projects. ITG happens to be one of the most important levels of governance. It is an important approach to structure process through relational mechanisms. There is little evidence that success in implementing ITG reforms leads to more rapid and inclusive economics. This paper aims to study the importance of ITG in public sector organizations. The public sector is considered to be a set of organizations with the mission to serve citizens. Furthermore, this paper is going to come up with the answer to an essential question which is if ITG should rely on stable functions of a public sector organization, or should it consider broader and more evolving objectives touching the whole government?","authors":["Amine Laita","Mustapha Belaissaoui"],"meta":["September 2017Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46568-5_34","In book: Europe and MENA Cooperation Advances in Information and Communication Technologies (pp.331-340)"],"references":["41060535_Public_and_Private_Sector_IT_Governance_Identifying_Contextual_Differences","313502699_IT_governance_and_its_mechanisms","241143214_Introduction_to_the_Minitrack_IT_Governance_and_its_Mechanisms_-_HICSS_2013","224686943_Introduction_to_the_Minitrack_IT_Governance_and_Its_Mechanisms","5175420_Don't_Just_Lead_Govern_Implementing_Effective_IT_Governance","2490107_Comparative_Analysis_Between_the_Public_and_Private_Sectors_on_the_ISIT_Outsourcing_Practices_in_a_Developing_Country_A_Field_Study"]}
