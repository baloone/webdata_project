{"id":"318814762_Evaluation_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Predicting_Student's_Performance","abstract":"Abstract—This paper highlights important issues of higher education system such as predicting student’s academic performance. This is trivial to study predominantly from the point of view of the institutional administration, management, different stakeholder, faculty, students as well as parents. For making the analysis on the student data we selected algorithms like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, PART and Bayes Network with three most important techniques such as 10-fold cross-validation, percentage split (74%) and training set. After performing analysis on different metrics (Time to build Classifier, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Relative Absolute Error, Root Relative Squared Error, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, ROC Area) by different data mining algorithm, we are able to find which algorithm is performing better than other on the student dataset in hand, so that we are able to make a guideline for future improvement in student performance in education. According to the analysis of student dataset, we found that Random Forest algorithm gave the best result as compared to another algorithm with Recall value approximately equal to one. The analysis of different data mini g algorithm gave an in-depth awareness about how these algorithms predict student the performance of the different student and enhance their skill.","authors":["Mukesh Kumar","A J Singh"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science 8(8):25-31","DOI:10.5815/ijmecs.2017.08.04","Project: Predicting Students Academic Performance using Data Mining Techniques: A Case Study"],"references":["320298124_Literature_Survey_on_Student's_Performance_Prediction_in_Education_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","316921995_Literature_Survey_on_Educational_Dropout_Prediction","301734592_Towards_the_Integration_of_Multiple_Classifier_pertaining_to_the_Student's_Performance_Prediction","287718318_Predicting_Student_Academic_Performance_at_Degree_Level_A_Case_Study","335204163_Association_Rule_Generation_for_Student_Performance_Analysis_using_Apriori_Algorithm","317109378_Analyzing_undergraduate_students'_performance_using_educational_data_mining","306316861_The_prediction_of_students'_academic_performance_using_classification_data_mining_techniques","305361951_Student_Performance_Prediction_System_with_Educational_Data_Mining","300852781_Investigating_performance_of_students","288308960_Students'_performance_prediction_by_using_institutional_internal_and_external_open_data_sources"]}
