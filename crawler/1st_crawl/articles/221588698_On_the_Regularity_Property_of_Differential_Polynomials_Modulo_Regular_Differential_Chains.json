{"id":"221588698_On_the_Regularity_Property_of_Differential_Polynomials_Modulo_Regular_Differential_Chains","abstract":"This paper provides an algorithm which computes the normal form of a rational differential fraction modulo a regular differential chain if, and only if, this normal form exists. A regularity test for polynomials modulo regular chains is revisited in the nondifferential setting and lifted to differential algebra. A new characterization of regular chains is provided.","authors":["François Boulier","François Lemaire","Alexandre Sedoglavic"],"meta":["September 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-23568-9_6","SourceDBLP","Conference: Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing - 13th International Workshop, CASC 2011, Kassel, Germany, September 5-9, 2011.
