{"id":"282638422_Efficient_shape_optimization_for_fluid-structure_interaction_problems","abstract":"An approach for the shape optimization of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems is presented. It is based on a partitioned solution procedure for fluid–structure interaction, a shape representation with NURBS, and sequential quadratic programming approach for optimization within a parallel environment with MPI as direct coupling tool. The optimization procedure is accelerated by employing reduced order models based on a proper orthogonal decomposition method with snapshots and Kriging. After the verification of the FSI optimization, the functionality and efficiency of the reduced order modeling as well as the corresponding optimization procedure are investigated.","authors":["Nima Aghajari","Michael Schäfer"],"meta":["August 2015Journal of Fluids and Structures 57:298-313","DOI:10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2015.06.011"],"references":["236843208_Kriging_Models_for_Global_Approximation_in_Simulation-Based_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization","235709905_A_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Selecting_Vales_of_Input_Variables_in_the_Analysis_of_Output_From_a_Computer_Code","227315589_Shape_Design_Optimisation_of_Stationary_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Problems_With_Large_Displacement_and_Turbulence","321133827_A_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Selecting_Values_of_Input_Variables_in_the_Analysis_of_Output_from_a_Computer_Code","257281416_A_general_approach_to_sensitivity_analysis_of_fluid-structure_interactions","244492693_Quarterly_of_Applied_Mathematics","243083316_The_Convergence_of_a_Class_of_Double-Rank_Minimization_Algorithms","239375705_Grid_movement_techniques_and_their_influence_on_laminar_fluid-structure_interaction_computations","230468420_A_version_of_the_Aitken_accelerator_for_computer_iteration","229877140_Improved_linear_interpolation_practice_for_finite-volume_schemes_on_complex_grids","229751561_Minimum_drag_shape_in_2-dimensional_viscous-flow","229673654_Sensitivity_analysis_and_design_optimization_of_three-dimensional_non-linear_aeroelastic_systems_by_the_adjoint_method","229574922_Space_Conservation_Law_in_Finite_Volume_Calculations_of_Fluid_Flow","227899329_A_Class_of_Mixed_Assumed_Strain_Methods_and_the_Method_of_Incompatible_Modes","227661765_Improved_Numerical_Dissipation_for_Time_Integration_Algorithms_in_Structural_Dynamics","227281748_Conceptual_design_of_aeroelastic_structures_by_topology_optimization","227216707_The_Origins_of_Kriging","226780807_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_in_the_Context_of_Shape_Optimization_and_Computational_Wind_Engineering","226579789_An_Implicit_Partitioned_Method_for_the_Numerical_Simulation_of_Fluid-Structure_Interaction","225265665_Efficient_Numerical_Simulation_and_Optimization_of_Fluid-Structure_Interaction","216300383_The_Convergence_of_a_Class_of_Double-Rank_Minimization_Algorithms"]}
