{"id":"343841929_Syndrome_Compression_for_Optimal_Redundancy_Codes","abstract":"We introduce a general technique that we call syndrome compression, for designing low-redundancy error correcting codes. The technique allows us to boost the redundancy efficiency of hash/labeling-based codes by further compressing the labeling. We apply syndrome compression to different types of adversarial deletion channels and present code constructions that correct up to a constant number of errors. Our code constructions achieve the redundancy of twice the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, which improve upon the state of art for these channels. The encoding/decoding complexity of our constructions is of order equal to the size of the corresponding deletion balls, namely, it is polynomial in the code length.","authors":["Jin Sima","Ryan Gabrys","Jehoshua Bruck"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1109/ISIT44484.2020.9174009","Conference: 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)"],"references":["343840524_Optimal_Codes_Correcting_a_Burst_of_Deletions_of_Variable_Length","317190219_Guess_Check_Codes_for_Deletions_Insertions_and_Synchronization","313228704_Codes_Correcting_a_Burst_of_Deletions_or_Insertions","3080575_On_multiple_insertiondeletion_correcting_codes","336935199_Two_Deletion_Correcting_Codes_From_Indicator_Vectors","336087130_Polar_Codes_for_the_Deletion_Channel_Weak_and_Strong_Polarization","328331658_Codes_Correcting_Two_Deletions","327093015_Codes_Correcting_Two_Deletions","324559027_Deterministic_Document_Exchange_Protocols_and_Almost_Optimal_Binary_Codes_for_Edit_Errors","324492467_Unique_Reconstruction_of_Coded_Strings_From_Multiset_Substring_Spectra","324436082_Optimal_Document_Exchange_and_New_Codes_for_Small_Number_of_Insertions_and_Deletions","321351925_Codes_in_the_Damerau_Distance_for_Deletion_and_Adjacent_Transposition_Correction","319390214_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","280329908_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","264906503_On_highly_composite_numbers","246964409_Nonbinary_codes_correcting_single_deletion_or_insertion","51986583_Binary_Codes_Capable_of_Correcting_Deletions_Insertions_and_Reversals","3489258_Bit_Loss_and_Gain_Correction_Code","3084092_Nonbinary_codes_correcting_single_deletion_or_insertion_Corresp","3079942_Asymptotically_Good_Codes_Correcting_Insertions_Deletions_and_Transpositions"]}
