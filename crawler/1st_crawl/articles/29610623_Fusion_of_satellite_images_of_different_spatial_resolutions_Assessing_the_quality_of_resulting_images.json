{"id":"29610623_Fusion_of_satellite_images_of_different_spatial_resolutions_Assessing_the_quality_of_resulting_images","abstract":"Methods have been proposed to produce multispectral images with enhanced spatial resolution using one or more images of the same scene of better spatial resolution. Assuming that the main concern of the user is the quality of the transformation of the multispectral content when increasing the spatial resolution, this paper defines the properties of such enhanced multispectral images. It then proposes both a formal approach and some criteria to provide a quantitative assessment of the spectral quality of these products. Five sets of criteria are defined. They measure the performance of a method to synthesize the radiometry in a single spectral band as well as the multispectral information when increasing the spatial resolution. The influence of the type of landscape present in the scene upon the assessment of the quality is underlined, as well as its dependence with scale. The whole approach is illustrated by the case of a SPOT image and three different standard methods to enhance the spatial resolution","authors":["Lucien Wald","Thierry Ranchin","Marc Mangolini"],"meta":["November 1997Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 63:691-699","Project: Data fusion"],"references":["248976791_The_wavelet_transform_for_the_analysis_of_remotely_sensed_images","297950777_A_new_merging_method_from_multispectral_and_panchromatic_SPOT_images_for_a_mapping_of_floodplain_land-cover","290987433_Orthonormal_bases_of_compactly_supported_wavelets_Comm_Pure_and_Appl","280680664_Fusion_of_SPOT_panchromatic_and_multispectral_images_and_computation_of_the_Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index_at_the_spatial_resolution_of_10_m","279895306_Resolution_enhancement_of_multispectral_image_data_to_improve_classification_accuracy","269072067_Improving_Spot_Images_Size_And_Multispectral_Resolution","252711396_Incorporating_landscape_heterogeneity_in_land_surface_albedo_models","248976489_Effet_de_la_reesolution_spatiale_sur_des_proprieeacutetees_statistiques_des_images_satellites_une_eetude_de_cas","243779130_Merging_multispectral_and_panchromatic_SPOT_images_with_respect_to_the_radiometric_properties_of_the_sensor","243768511_Multiresolution_wavelet_decomposition_image_merger_of_Landsat_Thematic_Mapper_and_SPOT_panchromatic_data"]}
