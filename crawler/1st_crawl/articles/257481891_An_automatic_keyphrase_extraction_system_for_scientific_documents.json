{"id":"257481891_An_automatic_keyphrase_extraction_system_for_scientific_documents","abstract":"Automatic keyphrase extraction techniques play an important role for many tasks including indexing, categorizing, summarizing, and searching. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an automatic keyphrase extraction system for scientific documents. Compared with previous work, our system concentrates on two important issues: (1) more precise location for potential keyphrases: a new candidate phrase generation method is proposed based on the core word expansion algorithm, which can reduce the size of the candidate set by about 75% without increasing the computational complexity; (2) overlap elimination for the output list: when a phrase and its sub-phrases coexist as candidates, an inverse document frequency feature is introduced for selecting the proper granularity. Additional new features are added for phrase weighting. Experiments based on real-world datasets were carried out to evaluate the proposed system. The results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the refined candidate set and demonstrate that the new features improve the accuracy of the system. The overall performance of our system compares favorably with other state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction systems.","authors":["Wei You","Dominique Fontaine","Jean-Paul A.
