{"id":"257910765_Maximal_branching_processes_with_several_types_of_particles","abstract":"The paper introduces multitype maximal branching processes and their generalizations. Some examples of their explicit construction are given. The ergodic theorem is proved for the case of two types of particles.","authors":["Alexey V.
