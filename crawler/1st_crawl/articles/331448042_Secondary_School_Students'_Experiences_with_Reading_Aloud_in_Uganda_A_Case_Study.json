{"id":"331448042_Secondary_School_Students'_Experiences_with_Reading_Aloud_in_Uganda_A_Case_Study","abstract":"Reading aloud supports vocabulary build-up, provides basic background knowledge of the text and motivates learners’ interest in the text even among adolescents. This paper explores classroom experiences of Senior One students (12-13 years) with reading aloud of Soyinka’s (2007) play The Trials of Brother Jero. The findings show that both the teacher and the learners performed clear roles during the reading exercise and this seemed to create a systematic classroom environment for reading aloud. However data also indicates that although many of the learners declared to find value in reading aloud, some learners did not participate in the activity due to various reasons. The classroom context and the nature of the text also seemed to affect the way reading aloud was implemented during the lessons.","authors":["Rebecca Nambi"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Language Teaching and Research 10(2):224","DOI:10.17507/jltr.1002.02"],"references":["26814034_The_Complex_World_of_Adolescent_Literacy_Myths_Motivations_and_Mysteries","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","310055314_The_challenges_of_teaching_reading_in_Uganda_curriculum_guidelines_and_language_policy_viewed_from_the_classroom","279187534_The_Good_Research_Guide_For_Small-Scale_Social_Research_Projects","272566756_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_A_Methods_Sourcebook","272120985_Examining_Sixth_Grade_Students'_Reading_Attitudes_and_Perceptions_of_Teacher_Read_Aloud_Are_All_Students_on_the_Same_Page","267921875_How_to_Do_Discourse_Analysis_2nd_Edition_A_Toolkit","264670834_Reading_Aloud_An_Educator_Comments","262200536_Great_Read-Alouds_for_Prospective_Teachers_and_Secondary_Students","260354022_Another_Educator_Comments","250055463_Tapping_the_Potential_of_Teacher_Read-Alouds_in_Middle_Schools","248287474_Thought_and_Language","240238643_How_elementary_students_referred_for_compensatory_reading_instruction_perform_on_school-based_measures_of_word_recognition_fluency_and_comprehension","236144141_The_art_of_Case_Study_Research","223219394_Education_sector_reform_The_Ugandan_experience","42792417_Dialogue_and_the_Development_of_Children's_Thinking_A_Sociocultural_Approach"]}
