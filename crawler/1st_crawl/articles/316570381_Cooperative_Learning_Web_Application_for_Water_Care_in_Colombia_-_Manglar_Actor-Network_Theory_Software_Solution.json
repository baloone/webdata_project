{"id":"316570381_Cooperative_Learning_Web_Application_for_Water_Care_in_Colombia_-_Manglar_Actor-Network_Theory_Software_Solution","abstract":"One of the major challenges related to water care in Colombia, is to teach and massify good practices along its territory and population, looking forward to promote the preservation of this valuable resource. This paper presents details corresponding to the design, development and implementation of the Web Application Manglar, born within the project Liga del Agua, proposed for cooperative learning towards water care in the department of Cundinamarca, Colombia. The designed Application uses a graph approach, focused on actors and relations, exposing how the participant organizations and communities cooperate, share resources and interact, letting any user to know what has been elaborated and constructed throughout the project Liga del Agua. In this document, we focus on the architecture corresponding to the designed Application, exposing the requirements and functionalities, developed and implemented, looking forward to guarantee a technological scenario for cooperative learning within this context.","authors":["Pedro Guillermo Feijóo-García","Fabián Medina Cortés","Catalina Ramirez","Edier Ernesto Espinosa Díaz"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 12(04):208","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v12i04.6733","Project: Social Computing and Engineering"],"references":["311521113_RoBlock_-_Web_App_for_Programming_Learning","314815147_El_uso_apropiacion_e_impacto_de_las_TIC_por_las_mujeres_rurales_jovenes_en_el_Peru","313373269_Agent-Based_Spatial_Simulation_with_NetLogo","241097002_Can_We_Find_Solutions_with_People_Participatory_Action_Research_with_Small_Organic_Producers_in_Andalusia","237136391_Opportunities_And_Obstacles_For_Distance_Education_In_Agricultural_Education","200026759_Science_in_Action_How_To_Follow_Scientists_and_Engineers_Through_Society"]}
