The convenience and ease of access to information is mesmerizing the healthcare sector setting the trend for e-Health. This was in an attempt to convey the promises, principles, excitement around e-commerce to the health arena, and give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up to the area of health care virtually collaborating everything related to computers and medicine. The healthcare environment is generally `information rich' but `knowledge poor'.
