{"id":"321460473_Enrichments_For_Pigs_Improving_Animal-Environment_Relations","abstract":"This paper provides a brief introduction on the welfare of pigs in the European Union (with special emphasis on their specific exploratory need). After describing the requirements of legislation and the main welfare challenges for the swine specie, we will explore the case of Italian heavy pigs intended for dry-cured Parma ham production, and describe the peculiar welfare issues in this production system. Lastly, we will address the directions in which we see potential collaboration with technology and design experts, both for application in behavioural research and for on-farm animal welfare assessment and monitoring. The possibility to create technologic (digital?) enrichments, or to integrate technology in manipulable substrates appears promising, although its effects on animal welfare and its applicability on a large scale should be further investigated.","authors":["Eleonora Nannoni","Giovanna Martelli","Luca Sardi"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3152130.3152151","Conference: the Fourth International Conference"],"references":["312179993_Behavior_of_Pigs_Reared_in_Enriched_Environment_Alternatives_to_Extend_Pigs_Attention","308866776_Early_detection_of_health_and_welfare_compromises_through_automated_detection_of_behavioural_changes_in_pigs","269811379_What_could_playing_with_pigs_do_to_us_Game_design_as_multispecies_philosophy","304916291_Power_participation_and_the_dog_internet","291140656_Long-term_effects_of_straw_blocks_in_pens_with_finishing_pigs_and_the_interaction_with_boar_type","266857929_Fresh_wood_reduces_tail_and_ear_biting_and_increases_exploratory_behaviour_in_finishing_pigs","251233881_Tail_docking_and_the_rearing_of_heavy_pigs_The_role_played_by_gender_and_the_presence_of_straw_in_the_control_of_tail_biting_Blood_parameters_behaviour_and_skin_lesions","248336219_The_influence_of_age_on_the_use_of_potential_enrichment_objects_and_synchronisation_of_behaviour_of_pigs","248336159_The_role_of_novelty_in_environmental_enrichment_for_the_weaned_pig","248335332_The_effect_of_environmental_stimulation_on_the_development_of_behavior_in_pigs"]}
