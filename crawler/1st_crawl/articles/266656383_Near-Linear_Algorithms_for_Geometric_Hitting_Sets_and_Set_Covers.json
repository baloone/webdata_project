{"id":"266656383_Near-Linear_Algorithms_for_Geometric_Hitting_Sets_and_Set_Covers","abstract":"Given a finite range space Σ = (X, R), with N = |X| + |R|, we present two simple algorithms, based on the multiplicative-weight method, for computing a small-size hitting set or set cover of Σ. The first algorithm is a simpler variant of the Brönnimann-Goodrich algorithm but more efficient to implement, and the second algorithm can be viewed as solving a two-player zero-sum game. These algorithms, in conjunction with some standard geometric data structures, lead to near-linear algorithms for computing a small-size hitting set or set cover for a number of geometric range spaces. For example, they lead to O(N polylog(N)) expected-time randomized O(1)-approximation algorithms for both hitting set and set cover if X is a set of points and ℜ a set of disks in R2.","authors":["Pankaj K.
