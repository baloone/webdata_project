{"id":"247330227_Patlak_CS_Random_walk_with_persistence_and_external_bias_Bull_Math_Biophys_15_311-338","abstract":"The partial differential equation of the random walk problem with persistence of direction and external bias is derived. By\npersistence of direction or internal bias we mean that the probability a particle will travel in a given direction need not\nbe the same for all directions, but depends solely upon the particle's previous direction of motion. The external bias arises\nfrom an anisotropy of the medium or an external force on the particle. The problem is treated by considering that the net\ndisplacement of a particle arises from two factors, namely, that neither the probability of the particle traveling in any\ndirection after turning nor the distance the particle travels in a given direction need be the same for all directions. A\nmodified Fokker-Planck equation is first obtained using the assumptions that the particles have a distribution of travel times\nand speeds and that the average time of travel between turns need not be zero. The fional equation incopporating the assumption\nof a persistence of direction and an external bias is then derived. Applications to the study of diffusion and to long-chain\npolymers are then made.","authors":["Clifford S.
