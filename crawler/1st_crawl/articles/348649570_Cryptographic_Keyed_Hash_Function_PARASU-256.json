{"id":"348649570_Cryptographic_Keyed_Hash_Function_PARASU-256","abstract":"Cryptography has distinct paramount significance in interconnected environment where whether we concern about ‘Computer-Security,’ ‘Information-Security,’ ‘Network-Security’ etc., doesn’t matters and, ingredients of this particular branch of computer science viz. ‘Encryption/Decryption’ systems, ‘Hash-Functions,’ ‘Digital-Signatures’ etc. also playing vital role from years in order to manage ‘Confidentiality,’ ‘Integrity’ and ‘Authenticity’ of resources. The Encryption/Decryption Cryptosystems managing the Confidentiality and Hash-Functions are fully devoted towards to look after the Integrity, Authenticity either alone or with Digital Signature schemes. There is a huge list of ‘Hash-Algorithms’ available with us to provide dedicated services (i.e., security) depends on how complex is to break it. Few renowned names are MD5, Blake, CRUSH, Grøstl, HAIFA, JH, Lake, SHA, Skein, Whirlpool etc., Keyed/Un-keyed constructions having its own justifiable capabilities. So in this direction we’re proposing a new secure keyed Hash-Function especially for military services where security is major concern apart from resource utilization which not only fulfilling basic properties but also providing justifiable services in order to manage integrity/authenticity of resources.","authors":["Arvind Kumar Sharma","Sudesh K Mittal"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 17(11):5072-5084","DOI:10.1166/jctn.2020.9343"],"references":["263656830_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_SHA_and_MD5_Algorithm","246375728_Higher_Order_Derivatives_and_Differential_Cryptanalysis","225958853_Rotational_Cryptanalysis_of_ARX","225208486_Constructing_Secure_Hash_Functions_by_Enhancing_Merkle-Damgrd_Construction","221354712_A_Design_Principle_for_Hash_Functions","326237194_Finding_Bugs_in_Cryptographic_Hash_Function_Implementations","277723629_Network_Security_and_Types_of_Attacks_in_Network","267719802_Cube_Attacks_on_Cryptographic_Hash_Functions","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","238655287_MIT_Laboratory_for_Computer_Science_and_RSA_Data_Security","221354656_One_Way_Hash_Functions_and_DES","221354688_Multicollisions_in_Iterated_Hash_Functions_Application_to_Cascaded_Constructions","220615788_The_Whirlpool_Secure_Hash_Function","216545742_Data_communications_and_networking","2559967_Hash_Function_Balance_and_Its_Impact_on_Birthday_Attacks"]}
