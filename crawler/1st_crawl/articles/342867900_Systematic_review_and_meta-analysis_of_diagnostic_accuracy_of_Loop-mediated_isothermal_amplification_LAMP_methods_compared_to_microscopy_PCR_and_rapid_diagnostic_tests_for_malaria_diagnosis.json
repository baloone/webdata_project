LAMP could be an alternative to conventional methods. Then, it is of interest to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP for malaria compared to microscopy, PCR, and RDTs.\n\nMethods and design\nWe searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus, from inception to 1 st July 2019. Prospective and retrospective, randomized and non-randomized, mono-center and multi-center studies, including symptomatic or asymptomatic patients that reported one LAMP method and one comparator (microscopy, RDT, PCR) were included. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017075186.\n\nResults\nSixty-six studies published between 2006 and 2019 were included leading to the analysis of 30 641 LAMP tests. The pooled sensitivity of LAMP remained between 96 and 98% whatever the comparator. The pooled specificity of LAMP was around 95%, but is a little higher if best PCR studies are considered. AUC were found to be above 0.98 whatever the subgroup of studies considered and DOR to be around 1000 for all subgroups except for Plasmodium vivax.\n\nConclusion\nThis meta-analysis confirms that LAMP method is robust for malaria diagnosis both in symptomatic and asymptomatic people. Thus, the impact of LAMP for the control of malaria is expected to be important.","authors":["Stephane Picot","Michel Cucherat","Anne-Lise Bienvenu"],"meta":["July 2020International journal of infectious diseases: IJID: official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases 98(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.009"],"references":["331991549_Field_evaluation_of_malaria_malachite_green_loop-mediated_isothermal_amplification_in_health_posts_in_Roraima_state_Brazil","329796464_Subpatent_malaria_in_a_low_transmission_African_setting_A_cross-sectional_study_using_rapid_diagnostic_testing_RDT_and_loop-mediated_isothermal_amplification_LAMP_from_Zambezi_region_Namibia","329602508_Loop-mediated_isothermal_amplification_LAMP_and_Polymerase_Chain_Reaction_PCR_as_quality_assurance_tools_for_Rapid_Diagnostic_Test_RDT_malaria_diagnosis_in_Northern_Namibia","329218183_Prevalence_and_Epidemiological_Characteristics_of_Asymptomatic_Malaria_Based_on_Ultrasensitive_Diagnostics_A_Cross-sectional_Study","328431096_Combination_of_PURE-DNA_extraction_and_LAMP-DNA_amplification_methods_for_accurate_malaria_diagnosis_on_dried_blood_spots","328255687_Clinical_Validation_of_a_Commercial_LAMP_Test_for_Ruling_out_Malaria_in_Returning_Travelers_A_Prospective_Diagnostic_Trial","328115304_Poor_Diagnostic_Performance_of_a_Species-Specific_Loop-Mediated_Isothermal_Amplification_LAMP_Platform_for_Malaria","327604257_Prevalence_of_asymptomatic_Plasmodium_infections_with_sub-microscopic_parasite_densities_in_the_northwestern_border_of_Thailand_A_potential_threat_to_malaria_elimination","337653978_Strengthening_diagnosis_is_key_to_eliminating_malaria_in_India","330540073_Use_of_Loop-Mediated_Isothermal_Amplification_in_a_Resource-Saving_Strategy_for_Primary_Malaria_Screening_in_a_Non-Endemic_Setting"]}
