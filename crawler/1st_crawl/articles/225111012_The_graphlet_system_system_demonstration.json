{"id":"225111012_The_graphlet_system_system_demonstration","abstract":"Graphlet is a portable, object oriented toolkit for graph editors and graph drawing algorithms, and is the successor of the GraphEd system. Graphlet is based on LEDA and Tcl/Tk. Algorithms can be implemented in C++ and LedaScript, a new scripting language based on Tcl/Tk. The GML format is a portable file format for graphs.","authors":["Michael Himsolt"],"meta":["April 2006","DOI:10.1007/3-540-62495-3_51","SourceCiteSeer","Conference: International Symposium on Graph Drawing"],"references":["226379624_LEDA_A_Library_of_Efficient_Data_Types_and_Algorithms","223040356_Algorithms_for_Drawing_Graphs_An_Annotated_Bibliography","220688777_LEDA_-_A_Platform_for_Combinatorial_and_Geometric_Computing","220266160_GD-Workbench_A_System_for_Prototyping_and_Testing_Graph_Drawing_Algorithms","30508458_Portable_Graph_Layout_and_Editing","2328560_Incremental_Layout_in_DynaDAG","225809851_Incremental_layout_in_DynaDAG","221557352_Incremental_Layout_in_DynaDAG","221557200_GraphEd_a_Graphical_Platform_for_the_Implementation_of_Graph_Algorithms","220779628_The_Stanford_GraphBase_A_platform_for_combinatorial_algorithms","220688482_Tcl_and_the_Tk_Toolkit","46953037_The_Design_of_an_Extendible_Graph_Editor","30508491_A_generic_compound_graph_visualizermanipulator_D-ABDUCTOR","30508466_Demonstration_of_the_Interactive_Graph_Visualization_System_da_Vinci","30508425_GraphEd_A_Graphical_Platform_for_the_Implementation_of_Graph_Algorithms_Extended_Abstract_and_Demo","30508335_CABRI-Graph_A_tool_for_research_and_teaching_in_graph_theory","2821926_Graph_Layout_through_the_VCG_Tool","2812149_Tcl_and_the_Tk_Toolkit"]}
