{"id":"259044488_Formulas_vs_Circuits_for_Small_Distance_Connectivity","abstract":"We give the first super-polynomial separation in the power of bounded-depth boolean formulas vs. circuits. Specifically, we consider the problem Distance k(n) Connectivity, which asks whether two specified nodes in a graph of size n are connected by a path of length at most k(n). This problem is solvable (by the recursive doubling technique) on circuits of depth O(log k) and size O(kn³). In contrast, we show that solving this problem on formulas of depth log n/(log log n)O(1) requires size nΩ(log k) for all k(n) ≤ log log n. As corollaries:\n(i) It follows that polynomial-size circuits for Distance k(n) Connectivity require depth Ω(log k) for all k(n) ≤ log log n. This matches the upper bound from recursive doubling and improves a previous Ω(log log k) lower bound of Beame, Impagliazzo and Pitassi [BIP98].\n(ii) We get a tight lower bound of sΩ(d) on the size required to simulate size-s depth-d circuits by depth-d formulas for all s(n) = nO(1) and d(n) ≤ log log log n. No lower bound better than sΩ(1) was previously known for any d(n) ≮ O(1).\nOur proof technique is centered on a new notion of pathset complexity, which roughly speaking measures the minimum cost of constructing a set of (partial) paths in a universe of size n via the operations of union and relational join, subject to certain density constraints. Half of our proof shows that bounded-depth formulas solving Distance k(n) Connectivity imply upper bounds on pathset complexity. The other half is a combinatorial lower bound on pathset complexity.","authors":["Benjamin Rossman"],"meta":["December 2013Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/2591796.2591828","SourcearXiv"],"references":["226755232_Top-down_lower_bounds_for_depth-three_circuits","226210377_Improved_depth_lower_bounds_for_small_distance_connectivity","221590478_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","220532929_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","2673891_Tight_Lower_Bounds_for_st-Connectivity_on_the_NNJAG_Model","2514119_Lower_Bounds_on_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Derivatives_Preliminary_Version","267296493_Average-Case_Complexity_of_Detecting_Cliques","242461646_The_Number_of_Two-Terminal_Series-Parallel_Networks","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","238737028_On_time-hardware_complexity_tradeoffs_for_Boolean_functions","226375948_Lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_bounded_depth_circuits_over_a_complete_basis_with_logical_addition","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","222216339_Relationships_between_nondeterministic_and_deterministic_tape_complexities","221590941_On_the_constant-depth_complexity_of_k-clique","221590182_Algebraic_Methods_in_the_Theory_of_Lower_Bounds_for_Boolean_Circuit_Complexity","221498971_Lower_Bounds_for_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Serivatives_Preliminary_Version","220975272_The_Complexity_of_Graph_Connectivity","220617636_Approximation_and_Small-Depth_Frege_Proofs","220616720_The_Shrinkage_Exponent_of_de_Morgan_Formulas_is_2","220544578_On_the_Depth_Complexity_of_Formulas","220430372_Undirected_connectivity_in_log-space","220394210_First-Order_Definability_on_Finite_Structures","220345595_Poisson_Approximation_for_Large_Deviations","220345178_The_number_of_Boolean_functions_computed_by_formulas_of_a_given_size","220115599_A_Direct_Version_of_Shamir_and_Snir's_Lower_Bounds_on_Monotone_Circuit_Depth","45882265_Bounds_on_Monotone_Switching_Networks_for_Directed_Connectivity","33888066_Computational_Limitations_for_Small_Depth_Circuits","3635348_Lower_Bounds_on_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Derivatives","3501856_Probabilistic_communication_complexity_of_Boolean_relations","2589482_Natural_Proofs","2462438_Probabilistic_Communication_Complexity_of_Boolean_Relations"]}
