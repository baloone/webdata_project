{"id":"309696633_Rescheduling_in_job-shop_problems_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems","abstract":"Manufacturing industries are faced with environmental challenges, so their industrial processes must be optimized in terms of both profitability and sustainability. Since most of these processes are dynamic, the previously obtained solutions cannot be valid after disruptions. This paper focuses on recovery in dynamic job-shop scheduling problems where machines can work at different rates. Machine speed scaling is an alternative framework to the on/off control framework for production scheduling. Thus, given a disruption, the main goal is to recover the original solution by rescheduling the minimum number of tasks. To this end, a new match-up technique is developed to determine the rescheduling zone and a feasible reschedule. Then, a memetic algorithm is proposed for finding a schedule that minimizes the energy consumption within the rescheduling zone but that also maintains the makespan constraint. An extensive study is carried out to analyze the behavior of our algorithms to recover the original solution and minimize the energy reduction in different benchmarks, which are taken from the OR-Library. The energy consumption and processing time of the tasks involved in the rescheduling zone will play an important role in determining the best match-up point and the optimized rescheduling. Upon a disruption, different rescheduling solutions can be obtained, all of which comply with the requirements but that have different values of energy consumption. The results proposed in this paper may be useful for application in real industries for energy-efficient production rescheduling.","authors":["Miguel A. Salido","Joan Escamilla","Federico Barber","A.
