{"id":"304614131_Robustness_measures_and_robust_scheduling_for_multi-objective_stochastic_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problems","abstract":"Flexible job shop scheduling in uncertain environments plays an important part in real-world manufacturing systems. With the aim of capturing the uncertain and multi-objective nature of flexible job shop scheduling, a mathematical model for the multi-objective stochastic flexible job shop scheduling problem (MOSFJSSP) is constructed, where three objectives of make-span, maximal machine workload, and robustness to uncertainties are considered simultaneously under a variety of practical constraints. Two new scenario-based robustness measures are defined based on statistical tools. To solve MOSFJSSP appropriately, a modified multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (m-MOEA/D) is developed for robust scheduling. The novelty of our approach is that it adopts a new subproblem update method which exploits the global information, allows the elitists kept in an archive to participate in the child generation, employs a subproblem selection and suspension strategy to focus more computational efforts on promising subproblems, and incorporates problem-specific genetic operators for variation. Extensive experimental results on 18 problem instances, including 8 total flexible and 10 partial flexible instances, show that the two new robustness measures are more effective than the existing scenario-based measures, in improving the schedule robustness to uncertainties and maintaining a small variance of disrupted objective values. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), our proposed m-MOEA/D-based robust scheduling approach achieves a much better convergence performance. Different trade-offs among the three objectives are also analyzed.","authors":["Xiao-Ning Shen","Ying Han","Jing-Zhi Fu"],"meta":["November 2017Soft Computing 21(21)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-016-2245-4"],"references":["293329707_Robust_Job_Shop_Scheduling_Problem_Mathematical_Models_Exact_and_Heuristic_Algorithms","287584091_Pareto-optimality_approach_for_flexible_Job-Shop_scheduling_problems_hybridization_of_evolutionary_algorithms_and_fuzzy_logic","286190724_Solving_the_Flexible_Job_Shop_Problem_with_Uniform_Processing_Time_Uncertainty","283023542_Effective_Ensembles_of_Heuristics_for_Scheduling_Flexible_Job_Shop_Problem_with_New_Job_Insertion","276090632_A_Decomposition_Based_Memetic_Algorithm_for_Multi-objective_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","273522057_Scheduling_optimization_of_a_stochastic_flexible_job-shop_system_with_time-varying_machine_failure_rate","270006462_Mathematical_modeling_and_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithms_applied_to_dynamic_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problems","267272462_A_Knowledge-Based_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Approach_for_Stochastic_Extended_Resource_Investment_Project_Scheduling_Problems","266476598_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms","264371319_Optimization_of_Schedule_Stability_and_Efficiency_Under_Processing_Time_Variability_and_Random_Machine_Breakdowns_in_a_Job_Shop_Environment","262877848_MOEAD_with_Tabu_Search_for_Multiobjective_Permutation_Flow_Shop_Scheduling_Problems","263602157_Predictable_Scheduling_of_a_Single_Machine_Subject_to_Breakdowns","261764778_Multiobjective_memetic_algorithm_based_on_decomposition","260042616_Robust_and_stable_flow_shop_scheduling_with_unexpected_arrivals_of_new_jobs_and_uncertain_processing_times","259150582_Pareto-optimality_Approach_for_Flexible_Job-shop_Scheduling_Problems_Hybridization_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_and_Fuzzy_Logic"]}
