{"id":"280656146_VariaMos_an_Extensible_Tool_for_Engineering_dynamic_Product_Lines","abstract":"This paper presents the new release of VariaMos, a Java-based tool for defining variability modeling languages, modeling (dynamic) product lines and cyber-physical self-adaptive systems, and supporting automated verification, analysis, configuration and simulation of these models. In particular, we describe the characteristics of this new version regarding its first release: (1) the capability to create languages for modeling systems with variability, even with different views; (2) the capability to use the created language to model (dynamic) product lines; (3) the capability to analyze and configure these models according to the changing context and requirements; and (4) the capability to execute them over several simulation scenarios. Finally, we show how to use VariaMos with an example, and we compare it with other tools found in the literature.","authors":["Raúl Mazo","Juan C Muñoz-Fernández","Luisa Rincon","Camille Salinesi"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1145/2791060.2791103","Conference: 19th International Software Product Line Conference (SPLC)","Project: A Generic and Extensible Requirements Engineering Framework for Self Adaptive Software Systems"],"references":["317447415_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","265466879_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","259231432_Constraints_The_Heart_of_Domain_and_Application_Engineering_in_the_Product_Lines_Engineering_Strategy","236843303_Integrating_heterogeneous_variability_modeling_approaches_with_invar","235961067_Supporting_Variability_Management_in_Architecture_Design_and_Implementation","224829572_Defects_in_Product_Line_Models_and_How_to_Identify_Them","259231433_Abstract_Constraints_A_General_Framework_for_Solver-Independent_Reasoning_on_Product_Line_Models","254464859_VULCAN_architecture-model-based_workbench_for_product_line_engineering","254037238_An_Integrated_Software_Management_Tool_for_Adopting_Software_Product_Lines","225238222_RequiLine_A_Requirements_Engineering_Tool_For_Software_Product_Lines"]}
