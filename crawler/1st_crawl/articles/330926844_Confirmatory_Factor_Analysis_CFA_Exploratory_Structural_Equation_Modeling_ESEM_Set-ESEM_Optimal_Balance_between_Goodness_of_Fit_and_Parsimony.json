Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) represents a compromise between exploratory factor analysisâ€™ (EFA) flexibility, and CFA/SEM's rigor and parsimony, but lacks parsimony (particularly in large models) and might confound constructs that need to be kept separate. In Set-ESEM, two or more a priori sets of constructs are modeled within a single model such that cross-loadings are permissible within the same set of factors (as in Full-ESEM) but are constrained to be zero for factors in different sets (as in CFA). The different sets can reflect the same set of constructs on multiple occasions, and/or different constructs measured within the same wave. Hence, Set-ESEM that represents a middle-ground between the flexibility of traditional-ESEM (hereafter referred to as Full-ESEM) and the rigor and parsimony of CFA/SEM. Thus, the purposes of this article are to provide an overview tutorial on Set-ESEM, juxtapose it with Full-ESEM, and to illustrate its application with simulated data and diverse \"real\" data applications with accessible, heuristic explanations of best practice.","authors":["Herb Marsh","Jiesi Guo","Theresa Dicke","Philip Parker"],"meta":["February 2019Multivariate Behavioral Research 55(1)","DOI:10.1080/00273171.2019.1602503","Project: Methodology in Structural Equation Modeling"],"references":["330370591_A_Systematic_Evaluation_and_Comparison_Between_Exploratory_Structural_Equation_Modeling_and_Bayesian_Structural_Equation_Modeling","324839466_Validating_the_Copenhagen_Psychosocial_Questionnaire_COPSOQ-II_Using_Set-ESEM_Identifying_Psychosocial_Risk_Factors_in_a_Sample_of_School_Principals","301318274_Toward_a_positive_psychology_of_indigenous_thriving_and_reciprocal_research_partnership_model","289963902_In_Search_of_Golden_Rules_Comment_on_Hypothesis-Testing_Approaches_to_Setting_Cutoff_Values_for_Fit_Indexes_and_Dangers_in_Overgeneralizing_Hu_and_Bentler's_1999_Findings","275555620_Methodological_Measurement_Fruitfulness_of_Exploratory_Structural_Equation_Modeling_ESEM_New_Approaches_to_Key_Substantive_Issues_in_Motivation_and_Engagement","326137674_The_Murky_Distinction_Between_Self-Concept_and_Self-Efficacy_Beware_of_Lurking_Jingle-Jangle_Fallacies","320435602_Individually_Weighted-Average_Models_Testing_a_Taxonomic_SEM_Approach_Across_Different_MultidimensionalGlobal_Constructs_Because_the_Weights_Don't_Make_No_Nevermind","313513535_Goodness_of_fit_evaluation_in_structural_equation_modeling","304193833_Motivation_in_Australian_Aboriginal_Populations","281460697_Exploratory_structural_equation_modeling","263334029_Reciprocal_Effects_of_Self-Concept_and_Performance_From_a_Muldimensional_Perspective","271400962_Assessing_Goodness_of_Fit","266320742_Dimensional_Comparison_Theory_Paradoxical_relations_between_self-beliefs_and_achievements_in_multiple_domains","265324026_Rotation_Methods_Algorithms_and_Standard_Errors","259243773_Exploratory_Structural_Equation_Modeling_An_Integration_of_the_Best_Features_of_Exploratory_and_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis"]}
