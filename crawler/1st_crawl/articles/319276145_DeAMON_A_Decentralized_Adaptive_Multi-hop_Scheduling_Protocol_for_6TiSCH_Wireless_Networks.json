{"id":"319276145_DeAMON_A_Decentralized_Adaptive_Multi-hop_Scheduling_Protocol_for_6TiSCH_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"The IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard provides a link-layer mechanism, based on time synchronized channel hopping (TSCH), to enable deterministic low-power wireless mesh networking. The emerging IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH (6TiSCH) working group aims at harmonizing an IP-enabled protocol stack with IEEE 802.15.4e link layer. In 802.15.4-TSCH medium access control (MAC), nodes follow a communication schedule; however, the standard does not specify any scheduling policy. Therefore, a number of recent studies have investigated scheduling mechanisms for 6TiSCH wireless networks. This paper introduces DeAMON, which is decentralized adaptive multi-hop scheduling protocol for 6TiSCH wireless networks. The key features of DeAMON include traffic-awareness, sequential scheduling, parallel transmissions, robust over-provisioning, and adaptability to topology changes. Moreover, DeAMON incurs minimal signaling overhead. Performance evaluation demonstrates that DeAMON outperforms state-of-the-art distributed scheduling protocols in terms of reliability, latency, and resource utilization.","authors":["Adnan Aijaz","Usman Raza"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Sensors Journal PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/JSEN.2017.2746183","Projects: High-Performance Industrial Wireless NetworksIndustrial Internet of Things"],"references":["316883978_Experimental_Validation_of_a_Distributed_Self-Configured_6TiSCH_with_Traffic_Isolation_in_Low_Power_Lossy_Networks","313143887_Leapfrog_Collaboration_Toward_Determinism_and_Predictability_in_Industrial-IoT_Applications","308841729_Decentralized_broadcast-based_scheduling_for_dense_multi-hop_TSCH_networks","301197572_A_Centralized_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_IEEE_802154e_TSCH_based_Industrial_Low_Power_Wireless_Networks","281966008_Decentralized_Traffic_Aware_Scheduling_in_6TiSCH_Networks_Design_and_Experimental_Evaluation","280102169_Orchestra_Robust_Mesh_Networks_Through_Autonomously_Scheduled_TSCH","303094712_IEEE_802154e_a_Survey","298712921_Distributed_PID-based_Scheduling_for_6TiSCH_Networks","282191949_Wave_A_Distributed_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Convergecast_in_IEEE_802154e_Networks_Extended_Version","281966049_On-the-Fly_Bandwidth_Reservation_for_6TiSCH_Wireless_Industrial_Networks"]}
