{"id":"249216536_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Enumerating_All_the_Maximal_k_-Plexes","abstract":"Finding and enumerating subgraphs of different structures in a graph or a network is one of the fundamental problems in combinatorics.\nOne of the earliest subgraph models is clique. However, the clique approach has been criticized for its overly restrictive\nnature. k-plex is one of the models which are introduced by weakening the requirement of clique. The problem to enumerate all the maximal\nk-plexes is NP complete. We consider this problem and propose an algorithm Pemp (Parallel Enumeration of all Maximal k-Plexes) for enumerating all the maximal k-plexes. We also propose a strategy to accelerate the pruning. A diameter pruning strategy is proposed. This strategy reduces\nthe number of small maximal k-plexes and improves the performance greatly. We also state the parallel edition of our algorithm to analysis large networks\nand a load balancing strategy is given. In addition, we evaluate the performance of Pemp on random graphs.","authors":["Bin Wu","Xin Pei"],"meta":["May 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-77018-3_47","Conference: Proceedings of the 2007 international conference on Emerging technologies in knowledge discovery and data mining"],"references":["244957010_A_graph-theoretic_definition_of_a_sociometric_clique","233251812_A_graph-theoretic_generalization_of_the_clique_concept","228620797_Clique_Relaxations_in_Social_Network_Analysis_The_Maximum_k-Plex_Problem","314043412_Introduction","298348409_Introduction_to_social_network_analysis","220423131_Finding_All_Cliques_of_an_Undirected_Graph"]}
