{"id":"267431246_Spanning_trees_with_a_bounded_number_of_leaves_in_a_claw-free_graph","abstract":"For a graph H and an integer k≥2 let σ k (H) denote the minimum degree sum of k independent vertices of H. We prove that if a connected claw-free graph G satisfies σ k+1 (G)≥|G|-k, then G has a spanning tree with at most k leaves. We also show that the bound |G|-k is sharp and discuss the maximum degree of the required spanning trees.","authors":["Mikio Kano","Aung Kyaw","Haruhide Matsuda","Kenta Ozeki"],"meta":["January 2012Ars Combinatoria -Waterloo then Winnipeg- 103"],"references":["220397530_On_a_Spanning_Tree_with_Specified_Leaves","37823186_On_Sufficient_Conditions_for_a_Graph_to_be_Hamiltonian","257289931_On_a_conjecture_of_Las_Vergnas_concerning_certain_spanning_trees_in_graphs","247010610_On_Maximal_Circuits_in_Finite_Graphs","229890148_Independence_trees_and_Hamilton_cycles","229747899_Longest_paths_and_cycles_in_K13-free_graphs","229620391_Hamiltonian_Cycles_in_Claw-free_Graphs","229620070_Long_paths_and_large_cycles_in_finite_graphs","222350911_On_a_Closure_Concept_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","220397799_Spanning_Trees_with_Few_Leaves"]}
