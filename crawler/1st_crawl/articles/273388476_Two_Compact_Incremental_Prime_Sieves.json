{"id":"273388476_Two_Compact_Incremental_Prime_Sieves","abstract":"A prime sieve is an algorithm that finds the primes up to a bound $n$. We say\nthat a prime sieve is incremental, if it can quickly determine if $n+1$ is\nprime after having found all primes up to $n$. We say a sieve is compact if it\nuses roughly $\\sqrt{n}$ space or less. In this paper we present two new\nresults:\n(1) We describe the rolling sieve, a practical, incremental prime sieve that\ntakes $O(n\\log\\log n)$ time and $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ bits of space, and\n(2) We show how to modify the sieve of Atkin and Bernstein (2004) to obtain a\nsieve that is simultaneously sublinear, compact, and incremental.\nThe second result solves an open problem given by Paul Pritchard in 1994.","authors":["Jonathan Sorenson"],"meta":["March 2015LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics 18(01)","DOI:10.1112/S1461157015000194","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234689699_Approximately_counting_semismooth_integers","316799464_Prime_Numbers","274075955_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","247888434_The_Gaussian_law_of_errors_in_the_theory_of_additive_number_theoretic_functions","245037116_The_segmented_sieve_of_eratosthenes_and_primes_in_arithmetic_progressions_to_10_12","244444718_The_First_Occurrence_of_Large_Gaps_Between_Successive_Primes","239060590_Prime_Numbers_A_Computational_Perspective","234794843_Analytic_computation_of_the_prime-counting_function","234780891_A_sublinear_additive_sieve_for_finding_prime_number","222017035_A_Space-Efficient_Fast_Prime_Number_Sieve"]}
