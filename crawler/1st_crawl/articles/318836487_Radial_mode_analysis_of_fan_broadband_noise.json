{"id":"318836487_Radial_mode_analysis_of_fan_broadband_noise","abstract":"In simplified models the fan broadband noise generation often is described by uniform distributions of sound power over the duct modes and by assuming full de-correlation of all modes. It is the first objective of an experimental study to verify whether these assumptions hold for a low-speed axial fan. The analysis was conducted by application of a technique that enables the complete decomposition of the ducted sound field into the radial mode constituents and the evaluation of the coherence of mode pairs. The drawback of the method consists in the large number of required sensor positions, which makes the application at large-scale turbo machinery test-rigs impracticable. Thus, the second objective is to assess the capabilities of alternative methods that base on sparse microphone arrays but require assumptions about the modal sound field.","authors":["Ulf Tapken","Benjamin Pardowitz","Maximilian Behn"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.2514/6.2017-3715","Conference: 23rd AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics ConferenceAt: Denver, Colorado"],"references":["225006266_Technique_to_Analyze_Characteristics_of_Turbomachinery_Broadband_Noise_Sources","290891178_Theoretical_and_experimental_investigations_of_microphone_probes_for_sound_measurements_in_turbulent_flow","280206569_Experiments_on_an_Axial_Fan_Stage_Time-Resolved_Analysis_of_Rotating_Instability_Modes","269193350_Radial_mode_analysis_of_broadband_noise_in_flow_ducts_using_a_combined_axial_and_azimuthal_sensor_array","259896916_Separation_of_hydrodynamic_perturbations_in_acoustic_liner_insertion_loss_measurements_at_a_fan_rig","253776337_Multimode_sound_transmission_in_ducts_with_flow","252508850_Modal_decomposition_in_ducts_based_on_transfer_function_measurements_between_microphone_pairs","224986724_Comparison_of_Different_Analysis_Techniques_to_Decompose_a_Broadband_Ducted_Sound_Field_in_its_Mode_Constituents","223897563_Estimation_of_the_far-field_directivity_of_broadband_aeroengine_fan_noise_using_an_in-duct_axial_microphone_array","223270132_A_modal_separation_measurement_technique_for_broadband_noise_propagating_inside_circular_ducts","222352317_Sound_transmission_and_generation_in_ducts_with_flow","4685665_Acoustic_Reflection_and_Transmission_of_2-Dimensional_Rotors_and_Stators_Including_Mode_and_Frequency_Scattering_Effects"]}
