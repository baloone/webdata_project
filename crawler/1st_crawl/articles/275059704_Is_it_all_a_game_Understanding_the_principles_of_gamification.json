{"id":"275059704_Is_it_all_a_game_Understanding_the_principles_of_gamification","abstract":"There is growing interest in how gamification—defined as the application of game design principles in non-gaming contexts—can be used in business. However, academic research and management practice have paid little attention to the challenges of how best to design, implement, manage, and optimize gamification strategies. To advance understanding of gamification, this article defines what it is and explains how it prompts managers to think about business practice in new and innovative ways. Drawing upon the game design literature, we present a framework of three gamification principles—mechanics, dynamics, and emotions (MDE)—to explain how gamified experiences can be created. We then provide an extended illustration of gamification and conclude with ideas for future research and application opportunities.","authors":["Karen Robson","Kirk Plangger","Jan Kietzmann","Ian Paul McCarthy"],"meta":["April 2015Business Horizons","DOI:10.1016/j.bushor.2015.03.006"],"references":["247780768_Game_Classification_and_Game_DesignConstruction_Through_Critical_Analysis","228884866_MDA_A_Formal_Approach_to_Game_Design_and_Game_Research","227675630_Achieving_Contextual_Ambidexterity_in_RD_Organizations_A_Management_Control_System_Approach","227413605_Social_Media_Get_Serious_Understanding_the_Functional_Building_Blocks_of_Social_Media","225027387_Beating_the_news_using_Social_Media_the_case_study_of_American_Idol","286687320_Idolized_Music_Media_and_Identity_in_American_Idol","271789939_Behavioral_Learning_Theory_Its_Relevance_to_Marketing_and_Promotions","254073049_Mandatory_Fun_Consent_Gamification_and_the_Impact_of_Games_at_Work","248446107_Why_we_Play_Games_Four_Keys_to_More_Emotion_without_Story","232561923_The_behavior_of_organisms_An_experimental_analysis"]}
