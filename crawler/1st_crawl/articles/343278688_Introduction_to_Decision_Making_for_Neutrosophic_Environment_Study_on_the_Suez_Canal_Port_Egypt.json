{"id":"343278688_Introduction_to_Decision_Making_for_Neutrosophic_Environment_Study_on_the_Suez_Canal_Port_Egypt","abstract":"Paper aims to use the programming codes in calculating the values of neutrosophic\ngrades and their representation in proving the certainty and uncertainty associated with the data\nof navigational projects development in the Suez Canal, Egypt. Added to, we reach a more\ndescriptive of the data in terms of certainty and uncertainty, and that is through the neutrosophic\nrepresentation of both the total revenue and the revenues of the Suez Canal from the transit\ncarriers and ships. Finally, we will present a study of the decision-making process regarding the\nbetter investment in the Suez Canal. Is it investing in the oil tankers or investing in cargo ships,\nas this is done based on neutrosophic data. This will be done by studying optimistic, pessimistic,\nand remorse entrances to the neutrosophic data, to see which oil tankers or cargo ships offer\nbetter returns to the Canal.","authors":["A. A.
