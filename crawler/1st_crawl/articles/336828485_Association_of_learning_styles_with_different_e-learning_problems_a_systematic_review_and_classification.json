{"id":"336828485_Association_of_learning_styles_with_different_e-learning_problems_a_systematic_review_and_classification","abstract":"Due to increase in complexity of modelling human behaviour in virtual environment, traditional or conventional didactic learning is limited in providing flexible or dynamic e-learning environment to students. Adaption of e-learning content with respect to several e-learning problems is open research problem in front of all of us. The purpose of this study is to review the learning styles having different classification methods associated with different e-learning problems. The open problems, challenges and prospective direction of e-learning research have also been described. Research papers from distinguished resources: Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, PubMed are reviewed and analyzed. The study examined the effectiveness of learning style and different classification methods in various e-learning problems. Different research papers have been classified based on learning style theories, adaptive classification methods, specific features and challenges faced in individual e-learning problems. 129 articles were studied and reviewed for meta-analysis. When adaptive and dynamic learning, blended with different learning styles and problems, then it’s found effective, which enhances learner’s performance and knowledge compared to traditional or conventional learning. This study supports researchers, academicians and practitioners in effectively adopting learning styles and method correspond to learning problems and provides a deep insight into its state of art.","authors":["Aditya Khamparia","Babita Pandey"],"meta":["March 2020Education and Information Technologies 25(2):1-29","DOI:10.1007/s10639-019-10028-y"],"references":["330634195_The_Impact_of_E-Learning_in_Medical_Education","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","286686970_Evaluation_of_social_personalized_adaptive_E-learning_environments_End-user_point_of_view","306350076_On_Predicting_Learning_Styles_in_Conversational_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_using_Fuzzy_Decision_Trees","300641292_A_Computational_Model_to_Determine_Desirability_of_Events_Based_on_Personality_for_Performance_Motivational_Orientation_Learners","292890774_Forecasting_e-learning_efficiency_by_using_artificial_neural_networks_and_a_balanced_score_card","292810243_Adaptation_to_student_learning_styles_in_web_based_educational_systems","288118128_A_semantic_rule-based_framework_for_efficient_retrieval_of_educational_materials","286963274_The_research_of_mining_association_rules_between_personality_and_behavior_of_learner_under_Web-based_learning_environment","286240596_Multi-criteria_Comparative_Evaluation_of_the_E-Learning_Systems_A_Case_Study","285952037_Ontology_and_Bayesian_network-based_user_model_framework","285724853_A_user-centric_adaptive_learning_system_for_e-learning_20","285326935_Risk_of_incident_diabetes_with_intensive-dose_compared_with_moderate-dose_statin_therapy","284488677_Online_Learners_and_Their_Learning_Strategies","284150669_Modeling_student's_learning_styles_in_web_20_learning_systems"]}
