{"id":"228692115_Structure_and_motion_by_fusion_of_inertial_and_vision-based_tracking","abstract":"We present a new structure and motion framework for real-time tracking applications combining inertial sensors with a camera. Our method starts from initial estimation of the state vector which is then used for the structure from motion algorithm. The algorithm can simultaneously determine the position of the sensors, as well as estimate the structure of the scene. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate motion by fusion of inertial and vision data. It includes two independent mea-surement channels for the low frequency vision-based measurements and for the high frequency inertial measurements, respectively. A bank of Kalman filters are designed to estimate the 3D structure of the real scene by using the result of motion estimation. These two parts work alternately. Our experimental results show good convergence of estimated scene structure and ground truth. Potential applications are in mobile augmented reality and in mobile robotics.","authors":["Jing Chen","Axel Pinz"],"meta":["January 2004"],"references":["221470186_Hand-Held_Acquisition_of_3D_Models_with_a_Video_Camera","220089964_3-D_Motion_and_Structure_Estimation_Using_Inertial_Sensors_and_Computer_Vision_for_Augmented_Reality","11597993_Robust_structure_from_motion_estimation_using_inertial_data","3193121_Fast_and_globally_convergent_pose_estimation_from_video_images_Patt_Anal_Mach_Intell_IEEE_Trans","2378888_Augmented_Reality_Using_Uncalibrated_Video_Sequences","250842103_Real-time_Structure_from_Motion_for_Augmented_Reality","229466043_Fusion_of_Vision_and_Inertial_Data_for_Motion_and_Structure_Estimation","226307397_Sequential_Updating_of_Projective_and_Affine_Structure_from_Motion","4009781_VIS-Tracker_A_wearable_vision-inertial_self-tracker","3192415_Recursive_Estimation_of_Motion_Structure_and_Focal_Length","3031401_Pose_estimation_using_line-based_dynamic_vision_and_inertial_sensors"]}
