{"id":"331624081_Temporal_information_gathering_process_for_node_ranking_in_time-varying_networks","abstract":"Many systems are dynamic and time-varying in the real world. Discovering the vital nodes in temporal networks is more challenging than that in static networks. In this study, we proposed a temporal information gathering (TIG) process for temporal networks. The TIG-process, as a node's importance metric, can be used to do the node ranking. As a framework, the TIG-process can be applied to explore the impact of temporal information on the significance of the nodes. The key point of the TIG-process is that nodes' importance relies on the importance of its neighborhood. There are four variables: temporal information gathering depth n, temporal distance matrix D, initial information c, and weighting function f. We observed that the TIG-process can degenerate to classic metrics by a proper combination of these four variables. Furthermore, the fastest arrival distance based TIG-process (fad-tig) is performed optimally in quantifying nodes' efficiency and nodes' spreading influence. Moreover, for the fad-tig process, we can find an optimal gathering depth n that makes the TIG-process perform optimally when n is small.","authors":["Cunquan Qu","Xiuxiu Zhan","Guanghui Wang","Jianliang Wu"],"meta":["March 2019Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.) 29(3):033116","DOI:10.1063/1.5086059"],"references":["332786049_Information_diffusion_backbones_in_temporal_networks","324390729_Coupling_dynamics_of_epidemic_spreading_and_information_diffusion_on_complex_networks","315748225_Dynamic_Graph_Metrics_Tutorial_Toolbox_and_Tale","312870733_Iterative_Neighbour-Information_Gathering_for_Ranking_Nodes_in_Complex_Networks","290522336_The_H-index_of_a_network_node_and_its_relation_to_degree_and_coreness","279633303_Influence_maximization_in_complex_networks_through_optimal_percolation","266081742_Data_on_face-to-face_contacts_in_an_office_building_suggest_a_low-cost_vaccination_strategy_based_on_community_linkers","265692063_Contact_Patterns_among_High_School_Students","256614442_Estimating_Potential_Infection_Transmission_Routes_in_Hospital_Wards_Using_Wearable_Proximity_Sensors","225045200_Importance_of_individual_events_in_temporal_networks","222819843_Theory_of_Rumour_Spreading_in_Complex_Social_Networks","221281813_Matching_Organizational_Structure_and_Social_Network_Extracted_from_Email_Communication","216637282_A_Set_of_Measures_of_Centrality_Based_on_Betweenness","51595498_Path_lengths_correlations_and_centrality_in_temporal_networks","51586826_High-Resolution_Measurements_of_Face-to-Face_Contact_Patterns_in_a_Primary_School","40685537_Distinguishing_Influence-Based_Contagion_From_Homophily-Driven_Diffusion_in_Dynamic_Networks","11663762_Efficient_Behavior_of_Small-World_Networks","8463907_Coevolution_of_Dynamical_States_and_Interactions_in_Dynamic_Networks","8268372_Cascade_Control_and_Defense_in_Complex_Networks","7284678_Taniguchi_CM_Emanuelli_B_Kahn_CRCritical_nodes_in_signalling_pathways_insights_into_insulin_action_Nat_Rev_Mol_Cell_Biol_785-96","6250104_A_Model_of_Internet_Topology_Using_k-shell_Decomposition","321316974_Identifying_Spreading_Sources_and_Influential_Nodes_of_Hot_Events_on_Social_Networks","316858943_Proceedings_of_the_VLDB_Endowment","311969480_Motifs_in_Temporal_Networks","311906750_Mathematics_of_Networks","305488779_Dynamics_of_information_diffusion_and_its_applications_on_complex_networks","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","290457201_Mathematics_of_networks","257391499_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_with_community_structure","257219065_Discovering_the_influential_users_oriented_to_viral_marketing_based_on_online_social_networks","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","223991902_Temporal_node_centrality_in_complex_networks","221665129_Epidemic_spreading_on_interconnected_networks","221653366_Social_influence_analysis_in_large-scale_networks","220618582_A_Critical_Review_of_Centrality_Measures_in_Social_Networks","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","51964964_Temporal_Networks","51798957_Dynamic_social_networks_promote_cooperation_in_experiments_with_humans","46423957_Epidemic_Threshold_for_the_Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible_Model_on_Random_Networks","24061828_The_Centrality_Index_of_a_Graph","6769446_Characterizing_the_Dynamical_Importance_of_Network_Nodes_and_Links"]}
