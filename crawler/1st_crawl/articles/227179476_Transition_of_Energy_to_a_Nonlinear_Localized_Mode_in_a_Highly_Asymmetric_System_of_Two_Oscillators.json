{"id":"227179476_Transition_of_Energy_to_a_Nonlinear_Localized_Mode_in_a_Highly_Asymmetric_System_of_Two_Oscillators","abstract":"Redistribution of energy in a highly asymmetric system consisting ofcoupled linear and highly nonlinear damped oscillators isinvestigated. Special attention is paid to the excitation of a nonlinearnormal mode while the energy is initially stored in other modes of thesystem. The transition proceeds via the mechanism of subharmonicresonance which is possible because of the strong nonlinearity of thesystem. The conditions of the energy transition to NNM being effectiveare revealed and guidelines to design such a systems are formulatedin detail.","authors":["Oleg V.
