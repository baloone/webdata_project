Where present of secret information can't realize or visible by malicious users. In this approach steganography procedure divided into two steps. In first step DNA sequence (combination of four nucleotides A,C,G&T) used to convert secret information into a grayscale image by generating key. In second step, gray scale image of step-1 will steganography by any standard steganography procedure.","authors":["Mr Suman Chakraborty","Kumar Samir","Samir Bandyopadhyay"],"meta":["December 2015"],"references":[]}
