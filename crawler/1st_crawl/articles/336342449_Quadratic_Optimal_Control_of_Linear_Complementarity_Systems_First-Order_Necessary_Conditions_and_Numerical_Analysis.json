{"id":"336342449_Quadratic_Optimal_Control_of_Linear_Complementarity_Systems_First-Order_Necessary_Conditions_and_Numerical_Analysis","abstract":"This article is dedicated to the analysis of quadratic optimal control of linear complementarity systems (LCS), which are a class of strongly nonlinear and nonsmooth dynamical systems. Necessary first-order conditions are derived, that take the form of an LCS with inequality constraints, hence are numerically tractable. Sufficiency is proved in a specific sense. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical developments and demonstrate the efficiency of the complementarity approach.","authors":["Alexandre Vieira","Bernard Brogliato","Christophe Prieur"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2019.2945878"],"references":["307636094_Well-Posedness_and_Output_Regulation_for_Implicit_Time-Varying_Evolution_Variational_Inequalities","301818871_Necessary_Optimality_Conditions_for_Optimal_Control_Problems_with_Equilibrium_Constraints","300001502_A_complementarity_approach_for_the_computation_of_periodic_oscillations_in_piecewise_linear_systems","270516551_Solving_Mathematical_Programs_with_Equilibrium_Constraints","326336539_CasADi_a_software_framework_for_nonlinear_optimization_and_optimal_control","314955172_Complementarity_and_Variational_Inequalities_in_Electronics","267009678_Popov-Belevitch-Hautus_type_controllability_tests_for_linear_complementarity_systems","260532867_Optimal_Control_for_Hybrid_Systems_With_Partitioned_State_Space","257605398_Optimal_Control_and_Applications_to_Aerospace_Some_Results_and_Challenges","244462245_Finite-Dimensional_Variational_Inequalities_and_Complementarity_Problems-Volume_I"]}
