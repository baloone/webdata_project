{"id":"323276729_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Long_LCF_with_k_Mismatches","abstract":"In the Longest Common Factor with $k$ Mismatches (LCF$_k$) problem, we are given two strings $X$ and $Y$ of total length $n$, and we are asked to find a pair of maximal-length factors, one of $X$ and the other of $Y$, such that their Hamming distance is at most $k$. Thankachan et al. show that this problem can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^k n)$ time and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ space for constant $k$. We consider the LCF$_k$($\\ell$) problem in which we assume that the sought factors have length at least $\\ell$, and the LCF$_k$($\\ell$) problem for $\\ell=\\Omega(\\log^{2k+2} n)$, which we call the Long LCF$_k$ problem. We use difference covers to reduce the Long LCF$_k$ problem to a task involving $m=\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log^{k+1}n)$ synchronized factors. The latter can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(m \\log^{k+1}m)$ time, which results in a linear-time algorithm for Long LCF$_k$. In general, our solution to LCF$_k$($\\ell$) for arbitrary $\\ell$ takes $\\mathcal{O}(n + n \\log^{k+1} n/\\sqrt{\\ell})$ time.","authors":["Panagiotis Charalampopoulos","Maxime Crochemore","Costas Iliopoulos","Tomasz Kociumaka"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["332292593_Longest_Common_Substring_with_Approximately_k_Mismatches","322517930_Longest_Common_Prefixes_with_k-Errors_and_Applications","283275390_ALFRED_A_Practical_Method_for_Alignment-Free_Distance_Computation","265415324_Longest_common_substrings_with_k_mismatches","322009652_Longest_Common_Prefixes_with_k-Mismatches_and_Applications","319394814_Algorithms_on_strings_trees_and_sequences_computer_science_and_computational_biology","300080198_A_Provably_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_k-Mismatch_Average_Common_Substring_Problem","280546196_More_Applications_of_the_Polynomial_Method_to_Algorithm_Design","268862803_Algorithms_on_strings_Translated_from_the_2001_French_original","266147294_A_note_on_the_longest_common_substring_with_k-mismatches_problem"]}
