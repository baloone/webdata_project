{"id":"222307045_Computing_the_COM_from_the_COP_in_postural_sway_movements","abstract":"A method is described for computing the Center of Mass (COM) from empirical estimates of the Center of Pressure (COP) obtained by means of a force platform. The method is based on a biomechanical model of sway movements in quiet standing, according to which the horizontal acceleration of the COM is approximately proportional to the COM-COP difference. The equations are solved by approximating the solution with best fitting spline functions. The implications for movement control are discussed. Introduction. In spite of its apparent simplicity, the nature of the control mechanisms that allow humans to stabilise postural sway is still an object of controversy. Sway is the persistent oscillation of the COM (Center Of Mass), the controlled variable, in the AP (Antero-Posterior) and ML (Medio-Lateral) planes. This variable is not measurable in a direct way, although is frequently","authors":["Pietro Morasso","Gino Spada","Roberto Capra"],"meta":["December 2000Human Movement Science 18(6):759-767","DOI:10.1016/S0167-9457(99)00039-1","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["200744645_A_Practical_Guide_to_Spline","13691364_An_algorithm_for_determining_gravity_line_location_from_posturographic_recordings","13540829_Stiffness_Control_of_Balance_in_Quiet_Standing","222804138_Adaptation_of_movement_to_altered_environments","49747932_Internal_models_in_the_cerebellum","19371965_Thresholds_for_the_detection_of_the_direction_of_whole-body_linear_movement_in_the_horizontal_plane","16481731_An_estimation_of_center_of_gravity_from_force_platform_data","15233073_Proprioceptive_visual_and_vestibular_thresholds_for_the_perception_of_sway_during_standing_in_humans","12816926_Can_Muscle_Stiffness_Alone_Stabilize_Upright_Standing","10832706_Internal_models_in_the_control_of_posture"]}
