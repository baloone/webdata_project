{"id":"334968219_Reconfiguration_Analysis_of_a_3-DOF_Parallel_Mechanism","abstract":"This paper deals with the reconfiguration analysis of a 3-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) parallel manipulator (PM) which belongs to the cylindrical parallel mechanisms family. The PM is composed of a base and a moving platform shaped as equilateral triangles connected by three serial kinematic chains (legs). Two legs are composed of two universal (U) joints connected by a prismatic (P) joint. The third leg is composed of a revolute (R) joint connected to the base, a prismatic joint and universal joint in sequence. A set of constraint equations of the 1-RPUâˆ’2-UPU PM is derived and solved in terms of the Euler parameter quaternion (a.k.a. Euler-Rodrigues quaternion) representing the orientation of the moving platform and of the Cartesian coordinates of the reference point on the moving platform. It is found that the PM may undergo either the 3-DOF PPR or the 3-DOF planar operation mode only when the base and the moving platform are identical. The transition configuration between the operation modes is also identified.","authors":["Maurizio Ruggiu","Xianwen Kong"],"meta":["August 2019Robotics 8(3):66","DOI:10.3390/robotics8030066"],"references":["323928729_Kinematics_Workspace_and_Singularity_Analysis_of_a_Parallel_Robot_With_Five_Operation_Modes","290395608_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_4-DOF_3-RER_parallel_manipulator_with_equilateral_triangular_base_and_moving_platform","284014093_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_4-RUU_parallel_manipulator","345181258_Advances_in_Reconfigurable_Mechanisms_and_Robots_II","320386937_A_variable-DOF_single-loop_7R_spatial_mechanism_with_five_motion_modes","317704455_Reconfiguration_Analysis_of_Multimode_Single-Loop_Spatial_Mechanisms_Using_Dual_Quaternions","314007348_Ideals_Varieties_and_Algorithms","311459812_Reconfiguration_Analysis_of_a_Variable_Degrees-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulator_With_Both_3-DOF_Planar_and_4-DOF_3T1R_Operation_Modes","303436470_The_Numerical_Solution_of_Systems_of_Polynomials_Arising_in_Engineering_and_Science","277680855_Type_Synthesis_of_3-DOF_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Both_a_Planar_Operation_Mode_and_a_Spatial_Translational_Operation_Mode_1"]}
