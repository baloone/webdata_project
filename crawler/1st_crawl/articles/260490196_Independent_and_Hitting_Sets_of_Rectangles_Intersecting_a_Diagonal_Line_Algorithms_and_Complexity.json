{"id":"260490196_Independent_and_Hitting_Sets_of_Rectangles_Intersecting_a_Diagonal_Line_Algorithms_and_Complexity","abstract":"Finding a maximum independent set (MIS) of a given fam- ily of\naxis-parallel rectangles is a basic problem in computational geom- etry\nand combinatorics. This problem has attracted signi?cant atten- tion\nsince the sixties, when Wegner conjectured that the corresponding\nduality gap, i.e., the maximum possible ratio between the maximum\nindependent set and the minimum hitting set (MHS), is bounded by a\nuniversal constant. An interesting special case, that may prove use- ful\nto tackling the general problem, is the diagonal-intersecting case, in\nwhich the given family of rectangles is intersected by a diagonal.\nIndeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6 approximation\nalgorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality gap is\nbetween 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete,\nproviding one smallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we\nderive an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set\nwhen, in addition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This\nimproves and extends a classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a\n2-approximation algo- rithm for the maximum weight independent set of\nrectangles intersecting a diagonal. Finally, we prove that for\ndiagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is between 2 and 4. The\nupper bound, which implies an approximation algorithm of the same\nfactor, follows from a simple com- binatorial argument, while the lower\nbound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in\nthe general case.","authors":["Jose R.
