{"id":"4242643_Machine_Learning_Techniques_and_Use_of_Event_Information_for_Stock_Market_Prediction_A_Survey_and_Evaluation","abstract":"This paper surveys machine learning techniques for stock market prediction. The prediction of stock markets is regarded as a challenging task of financial time series prediction. In this paper, we present recent developments in stock market prediction models, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we investigate various global events and their issues on predicting stock markets. From this survey, we found that incorporating event information with prediction model plays very important roles for more accurate prediction. Hence, an accurate event weighting method and a stable automated event extraction system are required to provide better performance in financial time series prediction","authors":["P.D. Yoo","M.H.
