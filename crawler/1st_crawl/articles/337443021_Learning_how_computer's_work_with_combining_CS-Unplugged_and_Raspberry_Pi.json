{"id":"337443021_Learning_how_computer's_work_with_combining_CS-Unplugged_and_Raspberry_Pi","abstract":"Almost from the beginning, computer science was hampered by the perception that computer science exclusively focused on programming. This results in computational-related learning being very limited and minimally taught to students. The widespread use of ICT tools in indirect learning has changed the way students interact with content. This paper presents a different approach, while keeping the teacher at the centre of control of classroom activities but students are given the opportunity to explore the content to be learned by CS-Unplugged and Raspberry Pi. This activity aims to provide basic knowledge about how computers work. One of the activities is a simulation and experimentation on how computers work through the CS Unplugged approach. The basic knowledge formed from the simulation was then used as the basis for assembling a simple computer using Raspberry Pi. Based on the results of observations and interviews conducted, the utilization of CS Unplugged provides a learning experience that builds on the initial concept of how computers work. This is shown by an increase in studentsâ€™ motivation and enthusiasm in learning how the computer works. This experience is what then makes it easy for students to do various computer assembly experiments using Raspberry Pi.","authors":["S Soviani","Jajang Kusnendar","Harsa Wara"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1280(3):032025","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1280/3/032025"],"references":["325187441_Using_NCLab-karel_to_improve_computational_thinking_skill_of_junior_high_school_students","266882704_Computer_Science_Unplugged_school_students_doing_real_computing_without_computers","221538606_A_CS_unplugged_design_pattern","26621858_Effect_of_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_ICT_on_Non-Industrial_Countries-Digital_Divide_Model","26619234_How_Prepared_are_Trainee_Teachers_of_University_Putra_Malaysia_UPM_to_Integrate_Computer_Technology_in_Classroom_Teaching","349548062_Learning_Computer_Architecture_with_Raspberry_PiR","312017796_Development_of_Interactive_Courseware_for_Learning_Basic_Computer_System_Components","262221657_On_plugging_unplugged_into_CS_classes","259257568_Media_multitasking_among_American_youth_Prevalence_predictors_and_pairings","239582464_A_model_curriculum_for_k-12_computer_science_report_of_the_acm_k-12_education_task_force_computer_science_curriculum_committee"]}
