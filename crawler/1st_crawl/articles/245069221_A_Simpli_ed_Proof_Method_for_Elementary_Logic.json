{"id":"245069221_A_Simpli_ed_Proof_Method_for_Elementary_Logic","abstract":"This chapter discusses the simplified proof method for elementary logic. The introduction of heuristics may yield considerable simplifications of a given proof method. Better methods may be obtained by adding various “heuristic” devices, which sometimes give shortcuts in the demonstrations but sometimes do not. The use of heuristic devices has been suggested by Newel1 and Simon and by Gelernter. The introduction of heuristics may yield considerable simplifications of a given proof method. The most suitable methods are perhaps those based on a Gentzen-type calculus, for instance the calculus given in Kanger or Beth's semantic tableaux. The simplified method given is identical with the proof method for elementary logic given in my “Handbok i logic” and is similar to a method independently given by Prawitz.","authors":["Stig Kanger"],"meta":["December 1963Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 35","DOI:10.1016/S0049-237X(08)72020-2"],"references":["242498964_The_logic_theory_machine","224105244_Intelligent_Behavior_in_Problem-Solving_Machines","224105170_A_Proof_Method_for_Quantification_Theory_Its_Justification_and_Realization","224105169_Toward_Mechanical_Mathematics","220431906_A_Mechanical_Proof_Procedure_and_its_Realization_in_an_Electronic_Computer","220424181_Proving_Theorems_by_Pattern_Recognition_-_II"]}
