{"id":"225432663_On_Seperating_Two_Simple_Polygons_by_a_Single_Translation","abstract":"LetP andQ be two disjoint simple polygons havingn sides each. We present an algorithm which determines whetherQ can be moved by a single translation to a position sufficiently far fromP, and which produces all such motions if they exist. The algorithm runs in timeO(t(n)) wheret(n) is the time needed to triangulate ann-sided polygon. Since Tarjan and Van Wyk have recently shown thatt(n)=O(n log logn) this improves the previous best result for this problem which wasO(n logn) even after triangulation.","authors":["Georgina Toussaint"],"meta":["December 1989Discrete & Computational Geometry 4(1):265-278","DOI:10.1007/BF02187729","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["220897244_The_Complexity_and_Decidability_of_Separation","17058008_Representation_and_Recognition_of_the_Movement_of_Shapes","302527372_Some_Collision_Avoidance_Problems_in_the_Plane","267049798_Computational_Geometry_and_Motion_Planning","266509327_Research_Problems_in_Discrete_Geometry","265332006_On_Removing_a_Ball_without_Disturbing_the_Others","242793958_Shortest_path_solves_edge-to-edge_visibility_in_a_polygon","242529567_On_removing_a_ball_without_disturbing_others_mathematics_magazine","242470755_Traditional_Galleries_Require_Fewer_Watchmen","234819367_A_linear-time_algorithm_for_triangulating_simple_polygons","231999345_Separability_of_pairs_of_polygons_through_single_translations","227933289_Euclidean_shortest_paths_in_the_presence_of_rectilinear_barriers","225115514_Translating_polygons_in_the_plane","223239923_Geodesic_methods_in_quantitative_image_analysis","221591085_On_Translating_a_Set_of_Rectangles","221590384_Detection_is_Easier_than_Computation_Extended_Abstract","221032522_Shortest_Path_Solves_Translation_Separability_of_Polygons","220983464_Sorting_Jordan_sequences_in_linear_time","220632616_On_translating_a_set_of_line_segments","220618273_Optimal_Search_in_Planar_Subdivisions","220617816_An_Onlog_log_n-Time_Algorithm_for_Triangulating_a_Simple_Polygon","220453200_Separating_Two_Simple_Polygons_by_a_Sequence_of_Translations","220114961_Testing_a_Simple_Polygon_for_Monotonicity","220110549_A_Linear_Algorithm_for_Finding_the_Convex_Hull_of_a_Simple_Polygon","41230077_Hierarchical_decomposition_of_polygons_with_applications","37597235_Hypothesizing_Channels_through_Free-Space_in_Solving_the_Findpath_Problem","27290799_The_Geometry_of_Metric_and_Linear_Spaces","4355299_A_theorem_on_polygon_cutting_with_applications","2716908_Movable_Separability_of_Sets","2342324_Separation_of_Two_Monotone_Polygons_in_Linear_Time"]}
