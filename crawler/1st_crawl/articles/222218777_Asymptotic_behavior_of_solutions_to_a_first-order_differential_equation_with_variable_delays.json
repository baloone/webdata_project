{"id":"222218777_Asymptotic_behavior_of_solutions_to_a_first-order_differential_equation_with_variable_delays","abstract":"We find conditions for the solution to a first-order differential equations to be: bounded by an exponential function, uniformly stable, and uniformly asymptotically stable. Estimates are obtained using Liapunov functionals (energy functionals). Our assumptions are weaker than those in the references, and results are extended to systems of equations and to nonlinear equations.","authors":["J.G.
