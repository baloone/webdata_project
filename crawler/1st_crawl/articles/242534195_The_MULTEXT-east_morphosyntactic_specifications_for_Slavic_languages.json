{"id":"242534195_The_MULTEXT-east_morphosyntactic_specifications_for_Slavic_languages","abstract":"Word-level morphosyntactic descrip- tions, such as \"Ncmsn\" designating a common masculine singular noun in the nominative, have been developed for all Slavic languages, yet there have been few attempts to arrive at a pro- posal that would be harmonised across the languages. Standardisation adds to the interchange potential of the re- sources, making it easier to develop multilingual applications or to evaluate language technology tools across sev- eral languages. The process of the harmonisation of morphosyntactic cat- egories, esp. for morphologically rich Slavic languages is also interesting from a language-typological perspective. The EU MULTEXT-East project developed corpora, lexica and tools for seven languages, with the focus being on morphosyntactic data, including formal, EAGLES-based specifications for lexi- cal morphosyntactic descriptions. The specifications were later extended, so that they currently cover nine languages, five from the Slavic family: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Serbian and Slovene. The paper presents these morphosyn- tactic specifications, giving their back- ground and structure, including the en- coding of the tables as TEI feature struc- tures. The five Slavic language specifi- cations are discussed in more depth.","authors":["Tomaž Erjavec","Kiril Simov","Cvetana Krstev","Marko Tadić"],"meta":["April 2003","DOI:10.3115/1613200.1613204","Project: BulTreeBank"],"references":["267235530_Intex_and_Slavonic_Morphology","250159173_HPSG-based_syntactic_treebank_of_Bulgarian_BulTreeBank","243744874_The_MULTEXT-East_Corpus","228713142_Building_the_Croatian_morphological_lexicon","225197599_Developing_the_Croatian_National_Corpus_and_Beyond","221152217_Tiered_Tagging_and_Combined_Language_Models_Classifiers","221102992_MULTEXT_Multilingual_Text_Tools_and_Corpora","220706866_Harmonised_Morphosyntactic_Tagging_for_Seven_Languages_and_Orwell's_1984","316037044_A_Comparative_Representation_of_Two_Bulgarian_Morphosyntactic_Tagsets_and_the_EAGLES_Encoding_Standard","243756367_Specifications_and_notation_for_lexicon_encoding","2479171_Multext-East_Parallel_and_Comparable_Corpora_and_Lexicons_for_Six_Central_and_Eastern_European_Languages","2454354_Standardized_Specifications_Development_and_Assessment_of_Large_Morpho-Lexical_Resources_for_Six_Central_and_Eastern_European_Languages","2403685_The_Concede_model_for_lexical_databases","2372088_CLaRK_-_an_XML-based_System_for_Corpora_Development","2418647_Guidelines_for_Electronic_Text_Encoding_and_Interchange_TEI_P3"]}
