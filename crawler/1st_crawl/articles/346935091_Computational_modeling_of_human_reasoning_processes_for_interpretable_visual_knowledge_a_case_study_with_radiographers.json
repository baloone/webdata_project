{"id":"346935091_Computational_modeling_of_human_reasoning_processes_for_interpretable_visual_knowledge_a_case_study_with_radiographers","abstract":"Visual reasoning is critical in many complex visual tasks in medicine such as radiology or pathology. It is challenging to explicitly explain reasoning processes due to the dynamic nature of real-time human cognition. A deeper understanding of such reasoning processes is necessary for improving diagnostic accuracy and computational tools. Most computational analysis methods for visual attention utilize black-box algorithms which lack explainability and are therefore limited in understanding the visual reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a computational method to quantify and dissect visual reasoning. The method characterizes spatial and temporal features and identifies common and contrast visual reasoning patterns to extract significant gaze activities. The visual reasoning patterns are explainable and can be compared among different groups to discover strategy differences. Experiments with radiographers of varied levels of expertise on 10 levels of visual tasks were conducted. Our empirical observations show that the method can capture the temporal and spatial features of human visual attention and distinguish expertise level. The extracted patterns are further examined and interpreted to showcase key differences between expertise levels in the visual reasoning processes. By revealing task-related reasoning processes, this method demonstrates potential for explaining human visual understanding.","authors":["Yu Li","Hongfei Cao","Carla McCaghren Allen","Xin Wang"],"meta":["December 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-77550-9"],"references":["337914502_A_Review_of_Perceptual_Expertise_in_Radiology-How_it_develops_How_we_can_test_it_and_Why_humans_still_matter_in_the_era_of_Artificial_Intelligence","334016972_Analysis_of_Perceptual_Expertise_in_Radiology_-_Current_Knowledge_and_a_New_Perspective","333495697_Quantifying_and_understanding_the_differences_in_visual_activities_with_contrast_subsequences","332359016_Eye-tracking_for_assessing_medical_image_interpretation_A_pilot_feasibility_study_comparing_novice_vs_expert_cardiologists","329744033_Emotional_Attention_A_Study_of_Image_Sentiment_and_Visual_Attention","326046602_State_of_the_Art_Eye-Tracking_Studies_in_Medical_Imaging","325162420_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Diabetes_Management_and_Decision_Support_Literature_Review","343462447_How_Much_Time_Do_You_Have_Modeling_Multi-Duration_Saliency","339963642_Where's_WALDO_a_potential_tool_for_training_radiology_residents","338506846_Emotion-Aware_Human_Attention_Prediction","324619139_Reasons_For_Physicians_Not_Adopting_Clinical_Decision_Support_Systems_Critical_Analysis","320220792_Selection_history_How_reward_modulates_selectivity_of_visual_attention","322289444_Common_resident_errors_when_interpreting_CT_of_the_abdomen_and_pelvis_A_review_of_types_pitfalls_and_strategies_for_improvement","322058035_Understanding_Low-_and_High-Level_Contributions_to_Fixation_Prediction","318201092_Evidence-based_anatomical_review_areas_derived_from_systematic_analysis_of_cases_from_a_radiological_departmental_discrepancy_meeting"]}
