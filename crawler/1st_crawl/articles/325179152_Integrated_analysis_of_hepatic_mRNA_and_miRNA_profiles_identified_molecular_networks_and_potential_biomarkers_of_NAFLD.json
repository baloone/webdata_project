{"id":"325179152_Integrated_analysis_of_hepatic_mRNA_and_miRNA_profiles_identified_molecular_networks_and_potential_biomarkers_of_NAFLD","abstract":"To enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms and mine novel biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), RNA sequencing was performed to gain hepatic expression profiles of mRNAs and miRNAs in NAFLD and normal rats. Using DESeq with thresholds of a two-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05, 336 mRNAs and 21 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed. Among those, 17 miRNAs (e.g., miR-144-3p, miR-99a-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-200b-5p, miR-200c-3p, etc.) might serve as novel biomarkers of NAFLD. MiRNA target genes (13565) were predicted by the miRWalk database. Using DAVID 6.8, the intersection (195 genes) of differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNA-predicted target genes were enriched in 47 gene ontology (GO) terms and 28 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Using Cytoscape, pathway interaction and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and hub genes (e.g., Abcg8, Cyp1a1, Cyp51, Hmgcr, etc.) associated with NAFLD were obtained. Moreover, 673 miRNA-mRNA negative regulatory pairs were obtained, and networks were constructed. Finally, several representative miRNAs and mRNAs were validated by real-time qPCR. In conclusion, potential molecular mechanisms of NAFLD could be inferred from integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA profiles, which may indicate novel biomarkers of NAFLD.","authors":["Mingzhe Zhu","Qianlei Wang","Wenjun Zhou","Tao Liu"],"meta":["May 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-25743-8"],"references":["319297820_Gene_expression_profiling_and_functional_analysis_reveals_that_p53_pathway-related_gene_expression_is_highly_activated_in_cancer_cells_treated_by_cold_atmospheric_plasma-activated_medium","319066898_Comprehensive_miRNA_expression_profiling_in_human_T-cell_acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia_by_small_RNA-sequencing","318694246_Expression_Profile_of_Genes_Potentially_Associated_with_Adequate_Glycemic_Control_in_Patients_with_Type_2_Diabetes_Mellitus","318620255_Metabolomic_characteristics_of_cholesterol-induced_non-obese_nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease_in_mice","318195784_Limited_cutaneous_systemic_sclerosis_skin_demonstrates_distinct_molecular_subsets_separated_by_a_cardiovascular_development_gene_expression_signature","317573805_Chronic_intermittent_hypoxia_induces_liver_fibrosis_in_mice_with_diet-induced_obesity_via_TLR4MyD88MAPKNF-kB_signaling_pathways","317556870_Fish_Oil_Feeding_Modulates_the_Expression_of_Hepatic_MicroRNAs_in_a_Western-Style_Diet-Induced_Nonalcoholic_Fatty_Liver_Disease_Rat_Model","317319137_Differential_expression_of_microRNAs_following_cardiopulmonary_bypass_in_children_with_congenital_heart_diseases","316768925_Farnesoid_X_receptor_induces_Takeda_G-protein_receptor_5_Crosstalk_to_regulate_Bile_Acid_Synthesis_and_Hepatic_Metabolism","318935459_Ablation_of_systemic_SIRT1_activity_promotes_nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease_by_affecting_liver-mesenteric_adipose_tissue_fatty_acid_mobilization","316597947_Aberrant_expression_of_microRNA_induced_by_high_fructose_diet_Implications_in_the_pathogenesis_of_hyperlipidemia_and_hepatic_insulin_resistance","314971015_Meta-analysis_reveals_up-regulation_of_cholesterol_processes_in_non-alcoholic_and_down-regulation_in_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","313832128_Integration_of_microRNA_and_mRNA_expression_profiles_in_the_skin_of_systemic_sclerosis_patients","313778993_The_Phytocomplex_from_Fucus_vesiculosus_and_Ascophyllum_nodosum_Controls_Postprandial_Plasma_Glucose_Levels_An_In_Vitro_and_In_Vivo_Study_in_a_Mouse_Model_of_NASH","313326827_Aerobic_endurance_training_improves_nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease_NAFLD_features_via_miR-33_dependent_autophagy_induction_in_high_fat_diet_fed_mice"]}
