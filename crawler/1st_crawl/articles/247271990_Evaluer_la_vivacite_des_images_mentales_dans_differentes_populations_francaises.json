{"id":"247271990_Evaluer_la_vivacite_des_images_mentales_dans_differentes_populations_francaises","abstract":"The aim of this article is to evaluate the vividness of visual imagery from three different sample groups: a contemporary dance group (n=24), a group of modified state of consciousness experts (n=24) and a group of students (n=48). We argue that the mental imagery activity into low vigilance level and into a modified state of consciousness has a closed link mechanism with vividness of visual imagery. We show that the modified state of consciousness experts reached a significantly higher level of vividness open-eyes score than the group of students. This could mean that higher open-eyes score is a cognitive trait of hypnotic susceptibility linked to specific training. These results stem from research into the close relationship between imagery and perception. We present a French adaptation and a French translation of Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, too. The VVIQ [Br. J. Psychol. 64 (1973) 17–24] is a questionnaire very used in clinical psychology and in cognitive psychology.","authors":["Alfonso Santarpia","Alain Blanchet","Rollon Poinsot","J.-F.
