{"id":"291831832_Degree_and_total_degree_of_edges_in_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_With_Application","abstract":"It is known that bipolar models give more precision, flexibility and compatibility to the system as compare to the classic and fuzzy models. A bipolar fuzzy graph can be obtained from two given bipolar fuzzy graphs using cartesian product and composition. In this paper, we have introduced the degree and total degree of an edge. Likewise, we found the degree of an edge in bipolar fuzzy graphs formed by these operations in terms of the degree of edges in the given bipolar fuzzy graphs in some particular cases. We defined μ-complement, self μ-complement, and self weak μ-complement on bipolar fuzzy graphs. Finally, we introduced an application of bipolar fuzzy digraphs.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 30(6)","DOI:10.3233/IFS-152075"],"references":["280808335_YinYang_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Sets","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","264725600_The_Degree_of_a_Vertex_In_Some_Fuzzy_Graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","235320032_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs","235318732_Fuzzy_Tolerance_Graphs","321163910_Edge_Regular_Property_of_Cartesian_Product_and_Composition_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs","263631239_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_SUBSEMIGROUPS_AND_SUBGROUPS_ASSOCIATED_BY_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_GRAPHS","242794179_Some_remarks_on_fuzzy_graphs","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220314865_Operations_on_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
