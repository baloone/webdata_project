{"id":"300670348_Teaching_Programming_and_Problem_Solving_The_Current_State","abstract":"Several approaches are currently used for introductory courses in Informatics. For example the ACM 2001 Curriculum report presents a choice of paradigms for the introductory programming courses imperative first, objects early, objects first, functional first. These courses are taught in a variety of programming languages, most notably Java, C, C++ and in the recent past Pascal. Normally one language is used in the programming courses. The Advanced Placement Examination in the US and Informatics departments in many countries are transitioning to Java due to its practical relevance and support of object-oriented programming. In some institutions, the introductory programming sequence is expanding from a two-course to a three-course sequence, e.g. programming basics, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms (DS+AL) or OOP1, 00P2, DS+AL.","authors":["Elliot Koffmann","Torsten Brinda"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-35619-8_13","In book: Informatics Curricula and Teaching Methods (pp.125-130)"],"references":[]}
