{"id":"265208083_How_to_Support_Students'_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_Educational_Robotics_Activities","abstract":"The term Computational thinking has received intense attention over the past several years as a fundamental skill, which promotes new ways of thinking to the students across all disciplines of science. The present study describes the implementation and evaluation of developing computational thinking skills in Educational Robotics activities for secondary Technical schools, which focus on the basic skills of CT: abstraction, generalization, algorithm, modularity, decomposition and problem solving. We summarize the results from pre-and post-questionnaires and a series of think-aloud interviews. The results suggest that the students became familiar with the concepts of CT, and integrated them to a satisfactory extent in the process of problem solving in ER activities.","authors":["Soumela Atmatzidou","Stavros N.
