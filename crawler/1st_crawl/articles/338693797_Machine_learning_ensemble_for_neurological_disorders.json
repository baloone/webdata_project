{"id":"338693797_Machine_learning_ensemble_for_neurological_disorders","abstract":"Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nerve system which affects body movements. The proposed technique selects best five machine learning models competitively, out of 25 state-of-the-art regression models to generate a robust ensemble. Data from 42 patients having early stage of Parkinson disease were collected which contains a total of 5875 voice recordings. Numerous state-of-the-art machine learning models have been explored to predict the motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Score (UPDRS) for the collected voice measures. Evaluation parameters such as correlation, R-Square, RMSE, and accuracy have been calculated for comparative analysis. Results from the ensemble model consisting of best five models have been recalculated to analyze the prediction. K-fold validation has been incorporated to measure the robustness of ensembled model. The proposed ensemble yields UPDRS with higher accuracy of 99.6% making it well suitable to assist the diagnose for Parkinson disease.","authors":["Harkawalpreet Kaur","Avleen Malhi","Husanbir Pannu"],"meta":["August 2020Neural Computing and Applications 32(1–2)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-020-04720-1"],"references":["334486412_Suitability_of_dysphonia_measurements_for_telemonitoring_of_Parkinson's_disease","324021865_Parkinson's_disease_detection_using_ensemble_techniques_and_genetic_algorithm","307248115_Biomarker_Discovery_and_Validation_for_Parkinson's_Disease_A_Machine_Learning_Approach","317724139_Clinical_decision_support_system_for_Parkinson's_disease_and_related_movement_disorders","312339464_Discriminative_Elastic-Net_Regularized_Linear_Regression","309151421_Features_selection_for_building_an_early_diagnosis_machine_learning_model_for_Parkinson's_disease","308091710_A_survey_of_nature-inspired_algorithms_for_feature_selection_to_identify_Parkinson's_disease","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","297626811_High-Accuracy_Detection_of_Early_Parkinson's_Disease_through_Multimodal_Features_and_Machine_Learning","286925002_An_Efficient_Hybrid_Kernel_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Approach_for_Early_Diagnosis_of_Parkinson's_Disease","284171796_Using_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_CART_to_Identify_Prescribing_Thresholds_for_Cardiovascular_Disease","265031802_Chapter_10_CART_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","285247236_Cart","265304466_Extending_the_Linear_Model_With_R_Generalized_Linear_Mixed_Effects_and_Nonparametric_Regression_Models","260406235_Projection_Pursuit_Regression"]}
