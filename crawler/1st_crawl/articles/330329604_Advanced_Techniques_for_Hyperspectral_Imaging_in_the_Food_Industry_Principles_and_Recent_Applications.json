{"id":"330329604_Advanced_Techniques_for_Hyperspectral_Imaging_in_the_Food_Industry_Principles_and_Recent_Applications","abstract":"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technology integrating optical sensing technologies of imaging, spectroscopy, and chemometrics. The sensor of HSI can obtain both spatial and spectral information simultaneously. Therefore, the chemical and physical information of food products can be monitored in a rapid, nondestructive, and noncontact manner. There are numerous reports and papers and much research dealing with the applications of HSI in food in recent years. This review introduces the principle of HSI technology, summarizes its recent applications in food, and pinpoints future trends. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology Volume 10 is March 25, 2019.
