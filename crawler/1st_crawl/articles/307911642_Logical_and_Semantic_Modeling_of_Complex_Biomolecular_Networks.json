{"id":"307911642_Logical_and_Semantic_Modeling_of_Complex_Biomolecular_Networks","abstract":"Systems biology models aim to describe and understand the behaviour of a cell. This living organism is represented by a complex biomolecular network. In the literature, most researches focus only on modeling isolated parts of this network, such as the metabolic network or the gene regulatory network. However, to fully understand the behaviour of a cell we should model and analyze the biomolecular network as a whole.","authors":["Ali Ayadi","Cecilia Zanni-Merk","Fran√ßois De Bertrand de Beuvron","Saoussen Krichen"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 96:475-484","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.08.108","Project: Semantic technologies for the optimization of complex biomolecular networks"],"references":["324366344_La_theorie_du_systeme_general_Theorie_de_la_modelisation","309608285_The_Gene_Ontology_project_in_2008","308163934_Formalisation_des_reseaux_biomoleculaires_complexes","289366384_Diffany_An_ontology-driven_framework_to_infer_visualise_and_analyse_differential_molecular_networks","285668548_Gene_ontology_Tool_for_the_unification_of_biology","281913522_Building_an_Ontology_for_Identity_Resolution_in_Healthcare_and_Public_Health","307956908_Time_ontology_in_OWL","301453054_KREM_A_Generic_Knowledge-based_Framework_for_Problem_Solving_in_Engineering_-_Proposal_and_Case_Studies","268630232_Mathematical_Modeling_of_Complex_Biological_Systems_A_Kinetic_Theory_Approach","266909773_On_the_mathematical_modelling_of_complex_biological_systems_A_kinetic_theory_approach"]}
