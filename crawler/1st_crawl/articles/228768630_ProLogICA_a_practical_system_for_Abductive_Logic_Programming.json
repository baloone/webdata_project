{"id":"228768630_ProLogICA_a_practical_system_for_Abductive_Logic_Programming","abstract":"This paper presents a new system called ProLogICA for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) with Nega-tion as Failure (NAF) and Integrity Constraints (ICs). The system builds upon existing ALP techniques but includes several optimisations and extensions necessi-tated by recent applications in computational biology, temporal reasoning and machine learning. Unlike some other ALP systems that support non-ground abduction through the integrated use of constraint solving, we adopt a more lightweight approach which avoids this complexity at the expense of only computing ground hypotheses. We argue our approach is suited to a wide class of real-world problems and demonstrate the effec-tiveness of ProLogICA on three non-trivial applications.","authors":["Oliver Ray","Antonis C.
