{"id":"325116878_Comparison_Analysis_of_TOPSIS_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Methods_On_Fertilizer_Selection","abstract":"Decision Support System is an interactive system that supports decision in the decision-making process through alternatives derived from the processing of data, information and design of the models. Selection decision support system of chemical fertilizer in fruit plant is expected to help anyone who wants to cultivate fruit trees can determine the chemical fertilizer as expected based alternatives and criteria set by the user. In this research method used is TOPSIS Method and Method of Fuzzy Logic. TOPSIS method is one of multiple criteria decision making method that uses the principle that the alternatives selected must have the shortest distance. Fuzzy Logic is a methodology of control systems troubleshooting, the fuzzy logic stated that everything is a binary which means it is only two possibilities, \"Yes or No\", \"True or False\", \"Good or Bad\", and others. Therefore, all of these can have a membership value of 0 or 1.","authors":["Asmara Indahingwati","Muh Barid Nizarudin Wajdi","Dwi Ermayanti Susilo","Nuning Kurniasih"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Engineering & Technology 7(2.3):109","DOI:10.14419/ijet.v7i2.3.12630"],"references":["325117665_A_Comparison_of_a-Sutte_Indicator_and_ARIMA_Methods_in_Renewable_Energy_Forecasting_in_Indonesia","324692666_An_integration_of_fuzzy_TOPSIS_and_fuzzy_logic_for_multi-criteria_decision_making_problems","324690496_Predicting_Network_Faults_using_Random_Forest_and_C50","324280829_Conceptual_Framework_for_Stock_Market_Classification_Model_Using_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Twitter_Based_on_Hybrid_Naive_Bayes_Classifiers","324052734_Support_vector_machine_in_the_anticipation_of_currency_markets","323338837_Keylogger_Application_to_Monitoring_Users_Activity_with_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithm","323336704_Analysis_of_Student_Satisfaction_Toward_Quality_of_Service_Facility","321800091_Comparative_Analysis_of_Membership_Function_on_Mamdani_Fuzzy_Inference_System_for_Decision_Making","321800010_Data_Collision_Prevention_with_Overflow_Hashing_Technique_in_Closed_Hash_Searching_Process","324054153_Optimizing_performance_of_fuzzy_decision_support_system_with_multiple_parameter_dependency_for_cloud_provider_evaluation"]}
