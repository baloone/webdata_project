{"id":"220148959_Algebraic_Feedback_Shift_Registers","abstract":"A general framework for the design of feedback registers based on algebra over complete rings is described. These registers generalize linear feedback shift registers and feedback with carry shift registers. Basic properties of the output sequences are studied: relations to the algebra of the underlying ring; synthesis of the register from the sequence (which has implications for cryptanalysis); and basic statisti- cal properties. These considerations lead to security measures for stream ciphers, analogous to the notion of linear complexity that arises from linear feedback shift registers. We also show that when the underlying ring is a polynomial ring over a finite field, the new registers can be simulated by linear feedback shift registers with small nonlinear filters.","authors":["Andrew Klapper","Jinzhong Xu"],"meta":["September 1999Theoretical Computer Science 226(1-2):61-92","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00066-3","SourceDBLP"],"references":["302386459_On_the_Linear_Complexity_of_Feedback_Registers","265368743_Feedback_with_Carry_Shift_Registers_over_Z_N","227002252_The_vulnerability_of_geometric_sequences_based_on_fields_of_odd_characteristic","226762364_Large_period_nearly_de_Bruijn_FCSR_sequences","225802359_2-Adic_shift_registers","221355576_Cryptanalysis_Based_on_2-Adic_Rational_Approximation","221348034_Feedback_Registers_Based_on_Ramified_Extensions_of_the_2-Adic_Numbers_Extended_Abstract","3077605_On_the_Linear_Complexity_of_Feedback_Registers","280040957_Feedback_shift_registers_2-adic_Span_and_combiners_with_memory","266345430_Approximation_lattices_of_p-adic_numbers","260590682_Shift_Register_Sequences","222455494_Approximation_lattices_of_p-adic_numbers","220942326_2-Adic_Shift_Registers"]}
