{"id":"318999659_Informatics_and_Programming_Education_at_Primary_and_Secondary_Schools_in_Japan","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the present situation of informatics and programming education at primary and secondary schools in Japan. Furthermore, we also explain post-2020 new informatics education. Previously, the importance of informatics education has not been recognized in Japan. However, with this educational reform, it is expected to start to change the attitude toward informatics education. In the New Course of Study, all elementary school students will experience programming and all high school students will learn informatics.","authors":["Susumu Kanemune","Shizuka Shirai","Seiichi Tani"],"meta":["July 2017OLYMPIADS IN INFORMATICS 11(1):143-150","DOI:10.15388/ioi.2017.11"],"references":["312222095_Introducing_computational_thinking_through_a_contest_on_informatics_Problem-solving_and_gender_issues","305340106_Informatics_Concepts_and_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Education_A_Lithuanian_Perspective","228894647_Dolittle_an_object-oriented_language_for_K12_education","281889737_Defining_Informatics_across_Bun-kei_and_Ri-kei"]}
