{"id":"321137502_Attending_to_structural_programming_features_predicts_differences_in_learning_and_motivation_in_a_virtual_robotics_programming_curriculum","abstract":"Educational robotics programs offer an engaging opportunity to potentially teach core\ncomputer science concepts and practices in K-12 classrooms. Here we test the effects of units\nwith different programming content within a virtual robotics context on both learning gains and\nth th\nmotivational changes in middle school (6 -8 grade) robotics classrooms. Significant learning\ngains were found overall, particularly for groups introduced to content involving program flow, the structural logic of program execution. Relative gains for these groups were particularly high on items that require the transfer of knowledge to dissimilar contexts. Reaching units that included program flow content was also associated with greater maintenance of programming interest when compared with other units. Therefore, our results suggest that explicit instruction in the structural logic of programming may develop deeper transferrable programming knowledge, and prevent declines in some motivational factors.","authors":["Eben B Witherspoon","Ross M.
