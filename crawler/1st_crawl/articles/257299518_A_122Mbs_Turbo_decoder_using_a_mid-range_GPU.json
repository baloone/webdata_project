{"id":"257299518_A_122Mbs_Turbo_decoder_using_a_mid-range_GPU","abstract":"Parallel implementations of Turbo decoding has been studied extensively. Traditionally, the number of parallel sub-decoders is limited to maintain acceptable code block error rate performance loss caused by the edge effect of code block division. In addition, the sub-decoders require synchronization to exchange information in the iterative process. In this paper, we propose loosening the synchronization between the sub-decoders to achieve higher utilization of parallel processor resources. Our method allows high degree of parallel processor utilization in decoding of a single code block providing a scalable software-based implementation. The proposed implementation is demonstrated using a graphics processing unit. We achieve 122.8Mbps decoding throughput using a medium range GPU, the Nvidia GTX480. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest Turbo decoding throughput achieved with a GPU-based implementation.","authors":["Xianjun Jiao","Canfeng Chen","Pekka Jääskeläinen","Vladimír Guzma"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583709","Conference: Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC), 2013 9th International"],"references":["224190510_Implementation_of_a_3GPP_LTE_turbo_decoder_accelerator_on_GPU","224096264_High_performance_turbo_decoder_on_CELL_BE_for_WiMAX_system","220541334_Implementation_of_a_High_Throughput_3GPP_Turbo_Decoder_on_GPU","261148693_GPU_Implementation_of_a_Programmable_Turbo_Decoder_for_Software_Defined_Radio_Applications","256293121_Heterogeneous_Computing_With_OpenCL","241624478_Implementing_and_optimizing_a_turbo_decoder_on_a_TI_TMS320C64x_device","226082726_The_UMTS_Turbo_Code_and_an_Efficient_Decoder_Implementation_Suitable_for_Software-Defined_Radios","224130594_The_GPU_computing_era","221147985_Design_space_exploration_of_the_turbo_decoding_algorithm_on_GPUs","220686601_Efficient_hardware_implementation_of_a_highly-parallel_3GPP_LTELTE-advance_turbo_decoder","3877173_Turbo_codes_on_the_fixed_point_DSP_TMS320C55x","3383017_Improving_the_max-Log-MAP_turbo_decoder","3337982_SIMD_Processor-Based_Turbo_Decoder_Supporting_Multiple_Third-Generation_Wireless_Standards"]}
