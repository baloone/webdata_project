As a cutting-edge computer simulation system, VR technology has undergone great development in scientific research, education and our daily life, etc. Herein, the development, characteristic, applications and potential limitations of VR technology was reviewed, especially, the applications of VR technology in medical science and professional education were highlighted. Moreover, a mini-research was carried out to study the teaching outcomes brought by VR technology from questionnaires. According to the results, it can be deduced that VR technology can solve the common problems in Chinese medical education.","authors":["Wenjing Yu","Liang Wen","Li-Ang Zhao","Xin Liu"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1176:022055","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1176/2/022055"],"references":["324543970_Augmented_reality_AR_and_virtual_reality_VR_applied_in_dentistry","321388919_Virtualisation_devices_for_student_learning_Comparison_between_desktop-based_Oculus_Rift_and_mobile-based_Gear_VR_virtual_reality_in_medical_and_health_science_education","317151786_Now_I_know_how_The_learning_process_of_medication_administration_among_nursing_students_with_non-immersive_desktop_virtual_reality_simulation","323433931_Virtual_Reality_as_a_Distraction_Intervention_to_Relieve_Pain_and_Distress_During_Medical_Procedures_A_Comprehensive_Literature_Review","320385872_Successful_implementation_of_Virtual_Environment_for_Radiotherapy_Training_VERT_in_Medical_Physics_education_The_University_of_Sydney's_initial_experience_and_recommendations","319616883_Using_Virtual_Reality_Simulation_Environments_to_Assess_Competence_for_Emergency_Medicine_Learners","316057546_Development_of_an_Instructional_Design_Model_for_Groundwork_Instruction_in_Flipped_Learning","275668085_Identifying_Opportunities_for_Virtual_Reality_Simulation_in_Surgical_Education_A_Review_of_the_Proceedings_from_the_Innovation_Design_and_Emerging_Alliances_in_Surgery_IDEAS_Conference_VR_Surgery","238757808_Interfaces_for_Advanced_Computing","13666010_VR_interaction_techniques_for_medical_imaging_applications"]}
