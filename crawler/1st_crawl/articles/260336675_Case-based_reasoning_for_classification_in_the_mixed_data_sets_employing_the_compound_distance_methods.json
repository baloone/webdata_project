{"id":"260336675_Case-based_reasoning_for_classification_in_the_mixed_data_sets_employing_the_compound_distance_methods","abstract":"Development of classiﬁcation methods using case-based reasoning systems is an active area of research.\nIn this paper, two new case-based reasoning systems with two similarity measures that support mixed categorical and numerical data as well as only categorical data are proposed. The principal difference between these two measures lies in the calculations of distance for categorical data. The ﬁrst one, named\ndistance in unsupervised learning (DUL), is derived from co-occurrence of values, and the other one,\nnamed distance in supervised learning (DSL), is used to calculate the distance between two values of the\nsame feature with respect to every other feature for a given class. However, the distance between\nnumerical data is computed using the Euclidean distance. Furthermore, the importance of numeric\nfeatures is determined by linear discrimination analysis (LDA) and the weight assignment to categorical\nfeatures depends on co-occurrence of feature values when calculating the similarity between a new case\nand the old one. The performance of the proposed case-based reasoning systems has been investigated\non the University of California, Irvine (UCI) data sets by 5-fold cross validation. The results indicate that\nthese case-based reasoning systems will produce a proper performance in predictive accuracy and\ninterpretability.","authors":["Mohammad Taghi Rezvan","Ali Zeinal
