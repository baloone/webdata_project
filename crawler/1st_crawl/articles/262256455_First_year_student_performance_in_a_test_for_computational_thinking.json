{"id":"262256455_First_year_student_performance_in_a_test_for_computational_thinking","abstract":"Computational thinking, a form of thinking and problem solving within computer science, has become a popular focus of research on computer science education. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the role that computational thinking plays in the experience of introductory computer science students at a South African university. To this end, we have designed and administered a test for computational thinking ability, and contrasted the results of this test with the class marks for the students involved. The results of this test give us an initial view of the abilities that students possess when entering the computer science course. The results indicate that students who performed well in the assessment have a favourable pass rate for their class tests, and specific areas of weakness have been identified. Finally, we describe the plan for a follow-up test to take place at the end of the course to determine how students' abilities have changed over a semester of studies.","authors":["Lindsey Gouws","Karen Bradshaw","Peter Wentworth"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1145/2513456.2513484","Conference: Proceedings of the South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists Conference","Project: CS Education"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","262285364_An_informatics_perspective_on_computational_thinking","234812396_Education_Paving_the_way_for_computational_thinking","228705449_Born_into_the_Digital_Age_in_the_south_of_Africa_the_reconfiguration_of_the_'digital_citizen'","220612700_Developing_a_computer_science-specific_learning_taxonomy","220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","262399549_Computational_thinking_in_educational_activities_An_evaluation_of_the_educational_game_Light-Bot","246664388_Learning_and_Teaching_Deep_and_Surface_Learning","224210284_Can_computational_thinking_reduce_marginalization_in_the_future_Internet","220807945_Computational_thinking_-_What_it_might_mean_and_what_we_might_do_about_it"]}
