{"id":"312829128_Formal_API_Specification_of_the_PikeOS_Separation_Kernel","abstract":"PikeOS is an industrial operating system for safety and security critical applications in, for example, avionics and automotive contexts. A consortium of several European partners from industry and academia works on the certification of PikeOS up to at least Common Criteria EAL5+, with “+” being applying formal methods compliant up to EAL7. We have formalized the hardware independent security-relevant part of PikeOS that is to be used in a certification context. Over this model, intransitive noninterference has been proven. We present the model and the methodology used to create the model. All results have been formalized in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.","authors":["Freek Verbeek","Oto Havle","Julien Schmaltz","Sergey Tverdyshev"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_26","Conference: NASA Formal Methods Symposium","Project: EURO-MILS"],"references":["285592141_Evolution_of_the_PikeOS_Microkernel","265743666_Model_Checking_Information_Flow","262410194_Noninterference_for_Operating_System_Kernels","262350163_Comprehensive_Formal_Verification_of_an_OS_Microkernel","262314058_Intransitive_noninterference_in_nondeterministic_systems","258333903_seL4_From_General_Purpose_to_a_Proof_of_Information_Flow_Enforcement","224248621_The_Complexity_of_Intransitive_Noninterference","220910193_SeL4_Formal_verification_of_an_OS_kernel","220270831_Information_Flow_Control_Revisited_Noninfluence_Noninterference_Nonleakage","3809707_What_is_intransitive_noninterference","3188857_Extending_the_Noninterference_Version_of_MLS_for_SAT","240086889_Noninterference_Transitivity_and_Channel-Control_Security_Policies","239552231_Dynamic_Intransitive_Noninterference","221268273_Information_Flow_Control_and_Applications_-_Bridging_a_Gap_-","220270808_What_Indeed_Is_Intransitive_Noninterference","201469308_IsabelleHOL_---_A_Proof_Assistant_for_Higher-Order_Logic","4260780_Comparing_Countermeasures_against_Interrupt-Related_Covert_Channels_in_an_Information-Theoretic_Framework","3500624_On_the_derivation_of_secure_components"]}
