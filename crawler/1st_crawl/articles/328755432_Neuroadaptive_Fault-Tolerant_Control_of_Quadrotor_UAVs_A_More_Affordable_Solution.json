{"id":"328755432_Neuroadaptive_Fault-Tolerant_Control_of_Quadrotor_UAVs_A_More_Affordable_Solution","abstract":"This paper investigates the position and attitude tracking control problem of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle subject to modeling uncertainties and actuator failures. A comprehensive mathematical model reflecting the nonlinearity and state-space coupling of the dynamics as well as actuation faults and external disturbances is derived. By combining the radial basis function neural networks (NNs) with virtual parameter estimating algorithms, an indirect NN-based adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is developed, which exhibits several attractive features as compared with most existing methods: 1) it is not only robust and adaptive to nonparametric uncertainties but also tolerant to unexpected actuation faults; 2) it ensures stable tracking without the need for precise information on system model; and 3) it only involves one lumped parameter adaptation, thus is structurally simpler and computationally less expensive, rendering the resultant scheme less demanding in programming and more affordable for onboard implementation. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method are confirmed via computer simulation.","authors":["Yongduan Song","Liu He","Dong Zhang","Jiye Qian"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems PP(99):1-9","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2876130"],"references":["309822017_Neuroadaptive_Fault-Tolerant_Control_of_Nonlinear_Systems_Under_Output_Constraints_and_Actuation_Faults","272382631_Robust_Control_of_Four-Rotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_With_Disturbance_Uncertainty","262070166_Nonlinear_Adaptive_Control_for_Quadrotor_Flying_Vehicle","261550850_A_Model-Based_Fault_Diagnosis_System_for_a_Mini-Quadrotor","224320669_Robust_neural_network_control_of_a_quadrotor_helicopter","224198367_Trajectory_tracking_control_design_with_command-filtered_compensation_for_quadrotor","221076856_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","3332722_Attitude_stabilization_of_a_VTOL_quadrotor_aircraft","3332569_Real-Time_Stabilization_and_Tracking_of_a_Four-Rotor_Mini_Rotorcraft","325681481_Neuroadaptive_Cooperative_Control_Without_Velocity_Measurement_for_Multiple_Humanoid_Robots_Under_Full-State_Constraints","312942865_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","312402359_Robust_quadrotor_actuator_fault_detection_and_isolation_in_presence_of_environmental_disturbances","312367305_Indirect_neuroadaptive_control_of_unknown_MIMO_systems_tracking_uncertain_target_under_sensor_failures","299997376_Robust_Backstepping_Sliding-Mode_Control_and_Observer-Based_Fault_Estimation_for_a_Quadrotor_UAV","297722655_Neural_Network_Control-Based_Adaptive_Learning_Design_for_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Full-State_Constraints","290985780_Tracking_Control_for_a_Class_of_Unknown_Nonsquare_MIMO_Nonaffine_Systems_A_Deep-Rooted_Information_Based_Robust_Adaptive_Approach","284950773_Nonlinear_Disturbance_Observer_based_Robust_Attitude_Tracking_Controller_for_Quadrotor_UAVs","276347954_Robust_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_for_Attitude_Tracking_of_an_Aircraft","275055869_Nonlinear_Robust_Adaptive_Tracking_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_UAV_Via_Immersion_and_Invariance_Methodology","273392100_A_Globally_Stabilizing_Path_Following_Controller_for_Rotorcraft_With_Wind_Disturbance_Rejection","265171744_Adaptive_trajectory_tracking_control_of_output_constrained_multi-rotors_systems","261701972_Passivity-based_adaptive_backstepping_control_of_quadrotor-type_UAVs","257581195_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_Helicopter","252060206_Neural_Network_Assisted_Computationally_Simple_PIlambdaDmu_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_UAV","232655042_Diagnosis_of_an_Inertial_Measurement_Unit_Based_on_Set_Membership_Estimation","225158497_Backstepping_Approach_for_Controlling_a_Quadrotor_Using_Lagrange_Form_Dynamics","224208099_Fault_tolerant_control_of_a_quadrotor_UAV_using_sliding_mode_control","223053224_Adaptive_actuator_failure_compensation_for_uncertain_nonlinear_systems_with_guaranteed_transient_performance"]}
