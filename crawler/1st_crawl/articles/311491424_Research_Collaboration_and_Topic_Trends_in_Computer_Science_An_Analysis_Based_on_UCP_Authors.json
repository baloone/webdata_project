{"id":"311491424_Research_Collaboration_and_Topic_Trends_in_Computer_Science_An_Analysis_Based_on_UCP_Authors","abstract":"Academic publication metadata can be used to analyze the collaboration, productivity and hot topic trends of a research community. Recently, it is shown that authors with uninterrupted and continuous presence (UCP) over a time window, though small in number (about 1%), amass the majority of significant and high-influence academic output. We adopt the UCP metric to retrieve the most active authors in the Computer Science (CS) community over different time windows in the past $50$ years, and use them to analyze collaboration, productivity and topic trends. We show that the UCP authors are representative of the overall population; the community is increasingly moving in the direction of Team Research (as opposed to Soloist or Mentor-mentee research), with increased level and degree of collaboration; and the research topics become increasingly inter-related. By focusing on the UCP authors, we can more easily visualize these trends.","authors":["Yan Wu","Srinivasan Venkatramanan","Dah Ming Chiu"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1145/2740908.2742015","Conference: the 24th International Conference"],"references":["263776839_Estimates_of_the_Continuously_Publishing_Core_in_the_Scientific_Workforce","235883078_Network_Effects_on_Scientific_Collaborations","235615532_Persistence_and_Uncertainty_in_the_Academic_Career","209716220_Network_Growth_and_the_Spectral_Evolution_Model","46423419_Complete_trails_of_coauthorship_network_evolution","23709169_The_Effects_of_Aging_on_Researchers'_Publication_and_Citation_Patterns","6397622_The_Increasing_Dominance_of_Teams_in_Production_of_Knowledge","321245909_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","312970191_Scientific_collaboration_networks","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","304533565_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networksJ","265371443_Computer_science_An_overview","261981610_Change_in_Academic_Coauthorship_1953-2003","221520118_Collaboration_Over_Time_Characterizing_and_Modeling_Network_Evolution","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","8036129_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks"]}
