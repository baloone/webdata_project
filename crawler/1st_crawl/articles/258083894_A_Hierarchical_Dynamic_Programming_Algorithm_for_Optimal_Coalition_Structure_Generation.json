{"id":"258083894_A_Hierarchical_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Coalition_Structure_Generation","abstract":"We present a new Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation of the Coalition\nStructure Generation (CSG) problem based on imposing a hierarchical\norganizational structure over the agents. We show the efficiency of this\nformulation by deriving DyPE, a new optimal DP algorithm which significantly\noutperforms current DP approaches in speed and memory usage. In the classic\ncase, in which all coalitions are feasible, DyPE has half the memory\nrequirements of other DP approaches. On graph-restricted CSG, in which\nfeasibility is restricted by a (synergy) graph, DyPE has either the same or\nlower computational complexity depending on the underlying graph structure of\nthe problem. Our empirical evaluation shows that DyPE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art DP approaches by several orders of magnitude in a large range\nof graph structures (e.g. for certain scalefree graphs DyPE reduces the memory\nrequirements by $10^6$ and solves problems that previously needed hours in\nminutes).","authors":["Meritxell Vinyals","Thomas Voice","Sarvapali D.
