{"id":"306392208_Systematic_Derivation_of_Bounds_and_Glue_Constraints_for_Time-Series_Constraints","abstract":"Integer time series are often subject to constraints on the aggregation of the integer features of all occurrences of some pattern within the series. For example, the number of inflexions may be constrained, or the sum of the peak maxima, or the minimum of the peak widths. It is currently unknown how to maintain domain consistency efficiently on such constraints. We propose parametric ways of systematically deriving glue constraints, which are a particular kind of implied constraints, as well as aggregation bounds that can be added to the decomposition of time-series constraints [5]. We evaluate the beneficial propagation impact of the derived implied constraints and bounds, both alone and together.","authors":["Ekaterina Arafailova","Nicolas Beldiceanu","Mats Carlsson","Pierre Flener"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-44953-1_2","Conference: International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming"],"references":["280852131_Describing_and_Generating_Solutions_for_the_EDF_Unit_Commitment_Problem_with_the_ModelSeeker","270451739_Filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","262155294_Reformulating_global_constraints_The_SLIDE_and_REGULAR_constraints","223690139_Enumeration_and_generation_with_a_string_automata_representation","221633262_Deriving_Filtering_Algorithms_from_Constraint_Checkers","45927421_Decomposition_of_the_NVALUE_constraint","313721982_A_filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","302973578_Time-Series_Constraints_Improvements_and_Application_in_CP_and_MIP_Contexts","282190573_Linking_Prefixes_and_Suffixes_for_Constraints_Encoded_Using_Automata_with_Accumulators","281299324_Using_finite_transducers_for_describing_and_synthesising_structural_time-series_constraints","262328461_Towards_Solver-Independent_Propagators","247931082_Introduction_to_automata_theory_languages_and_computation_-_2_ed","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","225172659_Sweep_as_a_Generic_Pruning_Technique_Applied_to_the_Non-overlapping_Rectangles_Constraint","2368851_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_the_Constraint_Language_ccFD"]}
