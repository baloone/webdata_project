{"id":"260712727_Approaching_Throughput_Optimality_With_Limited_Feedback_in_Multichannel_Wireless_Downlink_Networks","abstract":"This paper studies the allocation of feedback resources in the downlink of a frequency-division duplex (FDD) multichannel wireless system. We consider a downlink network with a single base station, L shared channels, and N mobile users. Throughput optimal algorithms like MaxWeight in general require the complete channel-state information (CSI) ( NL link states) for scheduling. Acquiring the complete CSI, however, is a prohibitive overhead in multichannel networks when the number of users is large. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the base station allocates only a limited amount of uplink resources for acquiring channel-state information. We first show that to support a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region (the throughput region with the complete CSI), the base station needs to acquire at least Θ((1-ε)L) link states at each time-slot. We then propose a Weight-Based Feedback allocation, named WBF, and show that WBF together with MaxWeight scheduling achieves a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region by acquiring Θ(L log[1/(ε)]) link states per time-slot. For i.i.d. on-off channels, we further prove that Θ(Llog[1/(ε)]) link states per time-slot is necessary for achieving a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region.","authors":["Ming Ouyang","Lei Ying"],"meta":["December 2013IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking 21(6):1827-1838","DOI:10.1109/TNET.2012.2235459"],"references":["231964136_Scheduling_in_a_queuing_system_with_asynchronously_varying_service_rates","224747946_On_the_capacity_of_MIMO_broadcast_channel_with_partial_side_information","224587452_Optimal_Channel_Probing_and_Transmission_Scheduling_for_Opportunistic_Spectrum_Access","224334043_Limited_feedback_schemes_for_downlink_OFDMA_based_on_sub-channel_groups","221628402_Scheduling_with_limited_information_in_wireless_systems","220429765_Stable_scheduling_policies_for_fading_wireless_channels","4198366_Finding_NEMO_near_mutually_orthogonal_sets_and_applications_to_MIMO_broadcast_scheduling","4102867_Opportunistic_splitting_algorithms_for_wireless_networks","3335316_Opportunistic_Spectral_Usage_Bounds_and_a_Multi-band_CSMACA_Protocol","3335063_Stable_scheduling_policies_for_fading_wireless_channels","3085304_On_the_Capacity_of_MIMO_Broadcast_Channels_With_Partial_Side_Information","311702569_Stability_properties_of_constrained_queueing_systems_and_scheduling_policies_for_maximum_throughput_in_multihop_radio_networks","266350430_Introduction_to_Ramsey_Spaces","246790653_Measurement-Based_Opportunistic_Feedback_and_Scheduling_for_Wireless_Systems","243785564_Scheduling_in_a_Queueing_System_with_Asynchronously_Varying_Service_Rates","228659919_Performance_guarantees_through_partial_information_based_control_in_multichannel_wireless_networks","224266593_On_Wireless_Scheduling_With_Partial_Channel-State_Information","224243853_Scheduling_for_small_delay_in_multi-rate_multi-channel_wireless_networks","224137001_Low-Complexity_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multichannel_Downlink_Wireless_Networks","221669789_Probability_and_Computing_Randomized_Algorithms_and_Probabilistic_Analysis","221628434_Distributed_opportunistic_scheduling_for_ad-hoc_communications","221596314_Scheduling_in_Multi-Channel_Wireless_Networks_Rate_Function_Optimality_in_the_Small-Buffer_Regime","220682470_Dynamic_Server_Allocation_to_Parallel_Queues_with_Randomly_Varying_Connectivity","220640280_Joint_Scheduling_and_Resource_Allocation_in_Uplink_OFDM_Systems_for_Broadband_Wireless_Access_Networks","3417561_Opportunistic_feedback_for_downlink_multiuser_diversity","3021245_Stability_Properties_of_Constrained_Queueing_Systems_and_Scheduling_Policies_for_Maximum_Throughput_in_Multihop_Radio_Networks","2936168_Exploiting_Medium_Access_Diversity_In_Rate_Adaptive_Wireless_LANs"]}
