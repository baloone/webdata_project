{"id":"262993462_A_Review_on_Mobility_and_Mobility_Aware_MAC_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","abstract":"Sensor Networks are usually limited with storage capacity, power consumption, computing power and mobility detection. But now a day wireless sensor networks facing a major problem of detection of mobile sensor nodes while doing a periodic detection or continuous monitoring of an event. So, this paper gives a review about different mobility patterns and comparison of Mobility Aware MAC protocols, which helps one for the better selection of MAC protocol in different mobile wireless sensor network applications. This review is the initial part of the research for developing the algorithm to extend the results, which are already achieved in the previous research.","authors":["Ankur V.
