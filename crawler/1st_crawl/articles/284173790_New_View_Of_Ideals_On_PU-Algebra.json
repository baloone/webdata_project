{"id":"284173790_New_View_Of_Ideals_On_PU-Algebra","abstract":"In this manuscript, we introduce a new concept, which called PU-algebra X. We state and prove some theorems about fundamental properties of it. Moreover ,we give the concepts of a weak right self-maps, weak left self-maps and investigated some its properties. Further, we have proved that every associative PU-algebra is a group and every p-semisimple algebra is an abelian group. We define the centre of a PU-algebra X and show that it is a p-semisimple sub-algebra of X, which consequently implies that every PU-algebra contains a p-semisimple PU-algebra .Furthermore, we give the concepts of ideals (i PU-ideals , i=1,2,3,4) in PU-algebra , classified they into classes correspond to various formula and we have proved that, they are coincide. Mathematics Subject Classification: 06F35, 03G25, 08A30. Keywords: PU-algebra, ideals of PU-algebra, G-part and P-radical of a PU-algebra, homomorphism of PU-algebra.","authors":["Samy Mostafa","Mokhtar A Abdel Naby","Alaa Eldin","I Elkabany"],"meta":["March 2015"],"references":["266050551_Fuzzy_Ideals_of_KU_-Algebras","26536823_On_Q-algebras","266289334_On_d-algebras","251046479_On_axiom_systems_of_propositional_calculi_XIV"]}
