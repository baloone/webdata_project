{"id":"242151583_Feedback_registers_based_on_ramified_extensions_of_the_2-adic_numbers","abstract":"A new class of feedback register, based on ramified extensions of the 2-adic numbers, is described. An algebraic framework\nfor the analysis of these registers and the sequences they output is given. This framework parallels that of linear feedback\nshift registers. As one consequence of this, a method for cracking summation ciphers is given. These registers give rise to\nnew measures of cryptologic security.","authors":["Mark Goresky","Andrew Klapper"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/BFb0053437"],"references":["222460754_On_Artin's_conjecture","284683881_On_Artin's_Conjecture","268493826_p-adic_Numbers_p-adic_Analysis_and_Zeta-Functions","228057825_Seminumerical_Algorithms","220684022_An_approach_to_an_arithmetic_analog_of_Berlekamp's_algorithm","220617513_A_Simple_Unpredictable_Pseudo-Random_Number_Generator","200104862_The_art_of_computer_programming_Volume_2_Seminumerical_algorithms_Reading","44503001_Shift_register_sequences_Solomon_W_Golomb","3084088_An_approach_to_an_arithmetic_analog_of_Berlekamp's_algorithm_Corresp"]}
