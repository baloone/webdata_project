{"id":"262154020_A_5-Approximation_for_Capacitated_Facility_Location","abstract":"In this paper, we propose and analyze a local search algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem. Our algorithm is a modification of the algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. [7] and improves the approximation ratio from 5.83 to 5. We achieve this by modifying the close, open and multi operations. The idea of taking linear combinations of inequalities used in Aggarwal et al.[1] is crucial in achieving this result. The example proposed by Zhang et al. also shows that our analysis is tight.","authors":["Manisha Bansal","Naveen Garg","Neelima Gupta"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33090-2_13","Conference: Proceedings of the 20th Annual European conference on Algorithms"],"references":["220442777_A_Multiexchange_Local_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Capacitated_Facility_Location_Problem","2488783_Facility_Location_with_Nonuniform_Hard_Capacities","227447865_A_Heuristic_Program_For_Locating_Warehouses","225489695_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Capacitated_Facility_Location_Problems","225165205_A_3-Approximation_for_Facility_Location_with_Uniform_Capacities","222936253_Analysis_of_a_Local_Search_Heuristic_for_Facility_Location_Problems","3921115_Facility_location_with_nonuniform_hard_capacities","2472813_Universal_Facility_Location"]}
