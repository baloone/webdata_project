{"id":"229494057_The_Patch_Test_A_condition_for_assessing_FEM_convergence","abstract":"This paper discusses various forms of the Irons patch test and shows again that its satisfaction is a necessary convergence condition being equivalent to consistency, Further, it is shown that the test can be applied for verification of stability requirements, thus providing also a sufficient condition of convergence. The patch test is useful in testing the order of asymptotic convergence and the satisfaction of the test gives a guide for development of certain incompatible element forms.","authors":["R. L.
