{"id":"334078853_Modeling_and_Design_of_Multirotors_with_Multi-joint_Arms","abstract":"This chapter presents the dynamic model of multirotors with multiple arms, which will be used for controller development in Part III and planning in Part V. It first presents the modeling of multirotors and arms individually, and them the coupled kinematic and dynamic model of the aerial robot with multiple arms. The chapter also presents the methodology for designing a light robotic arm for aerial manipulation.","authors":["Guillermo Heredia","Raul Cano","Antonio Jimenez-Cano","Anibal Ollero"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-12945-3_2","In book: Aerial Robotic Manipulation (pp.15-33)"],"references":["269263978_Cartesian_Impedance_Control_of_a_UAV_with_a_Robotic_Arm","319988659_Aerial_Manipulator_Dynamics","286475890_Control_of_a_multirotor_outdoor_aerial_manipulator","260145899_Robotics_Modelling_Planning_and_Control","255786198_Multirotor_Aerial_Vehicles_Modeling_Estimation_and_Control_of_Quadrotor","220695644_Introduction_To_Robotics_Mechanics_Control"]}
