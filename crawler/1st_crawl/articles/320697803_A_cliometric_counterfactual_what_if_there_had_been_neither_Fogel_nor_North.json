{"id":"320697803_A_cliometric_counterfactual_what_if_there_had_been_neither_Fogel_nor_North","abstract":"1993 Nobel laureates Robert Fogel and Douglass North were pioneers in the “new” economic history, or cliometrics. Their impact on the economic history discipline is great, though not without its critics. In this essay, we use both the “old” narrative form of economic history, and the “new” cliometric form to analyze the impact each had on the evolution of economic history.","authors":["Claude Diebolt","Michael Haupert"],"meta":["September 2018Cliometrica 12(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11698-017-0167-8"],"references":["303132973_The_Contribution_of_Douglass_North_to_New_Institutional_Economics","345817298_Latin_American_Economic_History","320698697_Railroads_and_American_Economic_Growth_Essays_in_Econometric_History","316269664_Econometric_History","315005365_Economic_History_Old_and_New","311794428_CLIO'S_contributions_to_economics_and_history","311729015_The_Poverty_of_Clio_Resurrecting_Economic_History","307589632_The_historiography_of_Australian_economic_history","296446302_Quantitative_research_in_american_economic_history","296421794_The_reunification_of_economic_history_with_economic_theory"]}
