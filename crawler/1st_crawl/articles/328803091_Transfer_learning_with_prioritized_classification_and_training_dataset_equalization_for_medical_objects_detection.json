We utilized the recent transfer-learning-based image classification methodology and focused on how easy it is to implement multi-class image classifiers in general and how to improve the classification performance without deep neural network model redesign. The goal for this was both to provide a baseline for the Medico task and to show the performance of out-of-the-box classifiers for the medical use-case scenario.","authors":["Olga Ostroukhova","Konstantin Pogorelov","Michael Alexander Riegler","Duc Tien Dang Nguyen"],"meta":["November 2018","Conference: MediaEval 2018At: Sophia Antipolis, France","Project: Medico - Automatic detection of disease in the GI tract benchmark"],"references":["328803082_Medico_Multimedia_Task_at_MediaEval_2018","316370428_Learning_laparoscopic_video_shot_classification_for_gynecological_surgery","316215961_KVASIR_A_Multi-Class_Image_Dataset_for_Computer_Aided_Gastrointestinal_Disease_Detection","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","316216011_Nerthus_A_Bowel_Preparation_Quality_Video_Dataset"]}
