{"id":"309854835_Injective_choosability_of_subcubic_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","abstract":"An injective coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the vertices of $G$ so that any two vertices with a common neighbor have distinct colors. A graph $G$ is injectively $k$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$, where $|L(v)| \\geq k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$, $G$ has an injective $L$-coloring. Injective colorings have applications in the theory of error-correcting codes and are closely related to other notions of colorability. In this paper, we show that subcubic planar graphs with girth at least 6 are injectively 5-choosable. This strengthens a result of Lu\\v{z}ar, \\v{S}krekovski, and Tancer that subcubic planar graphs with girth at least 7 are injectively 5-colorable. Our result also improves several other results in particular cases.","authors":["Boris Brimkov","Jennifer Edmond","Robert Lazar","Bernard Lidick√Ω"],"meta":["November 2016Discrete Mathematics 340(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2017.05.014"],"references":["320035828_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","312236637_An_introduction_to_the_discharging_method_via_graph_coloring","271832902_Counterexamples_to_a_conjecture_on_injective_colorings","239731754_A_Guide_to_the_Discharging_Method","221949463_Injective_colorings_of_sparse_graphs","45924631_Injective_Colorings_of_Graphs_with_Low_Average_Degree","305844167_List_injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_g6","285809852_A_prescribed_2-distance_D_1_-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_a_given_girth","257000969_List_injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_5_6_8","257000679_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs","256694402_Injective_coloring_of_plane_graphs_with_girth_5","251556753_Injective_choosability_of_planar_graphs_of_girth_five_and_six","251299089_Some_results_on_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs","242951447_List_2-distance_D_2-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6_and_D_24","226939982_Coloring_and_orientation_of_graphs","226115143_Injective_D_1-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","222958177_List_2-distance_D2-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_six","222840304_Injective_colorings_of_planar_graphs_with_few_colors","220192588_Some_bounds_on_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs","220189440_On_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs"]}
