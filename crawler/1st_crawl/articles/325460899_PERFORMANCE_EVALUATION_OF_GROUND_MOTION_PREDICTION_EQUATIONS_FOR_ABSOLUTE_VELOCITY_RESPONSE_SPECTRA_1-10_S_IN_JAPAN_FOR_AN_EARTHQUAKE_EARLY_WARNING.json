{"id":"325460899_PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_OF_GROUND_MOTION_PREDICTION_EQUATIONS_FOR_ABSOLUTE_VELOCITY_RESPONSE_SPECTRA_1-10_S_IN_JAPAN_FOR_AN_EARTHQUAKE_EARLY_WARNING","abstract":"In our previous study¹⁾, we constructed ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for absolute velocity response spectra from the viewpoint of earthquake early warning of long-period ground motion intensities. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of the GMPEs for seven recent earthquakes having Mw ≥ 6.5 that occurred after the construction of the GMPEs. We found that the GMPEs generally performed well for the events. Finally, we explain a methodology for the revision of site factors in the GMPEs, and discuss some implications for future study.","authors":["Yadab Dhakal","Wataru SUZUKI","Takashi KUNUGI","Shin AOI"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Japan Association for Earthquake Engineering 18(2):2_203-2_216","DOI:10.5610/jaee.18.2_203"],"references":["313113638_Strong_motions_observed_by_K-NET_and_KiK-net_during_the_2016_Kumamoto_earthquake_sequence","283919478_Improvement_of_hypocenter_determination_procedures_in_the_Japan_Meteorological_Agency","282959264_Ground_Motion_Prediction_Equations_for_Absolute_Velocity_Response_Spectra_1-10_S_in_Japan_for_Earthquake_Early_Warning","264311107_Lg_wave_propagation_in_the_Area_around_Japan_Observations_and_simulations","264215535_New_improved_version_of_Generic_Mapping_Tools_released","340825816_Establishment_of_a_method_for_real-time_and_long-term_seafloor_monitoring","274955823_A_stable_algorithm_for_regression_analyses_using_the_random_effect_model"]}
