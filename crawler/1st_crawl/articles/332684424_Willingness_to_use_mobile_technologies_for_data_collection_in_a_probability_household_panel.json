{"id":"332684424_Willingness_to_use_mobile_technologies_for_data_collection_in_a_probability_household_panel","abstract":"We asked members of the Understanding Society Innovation Panel about their willingness to participate in various data collection tasks on their mobile devices. We find that stated willingness varies considerably depending on the type of activity involved: respondents are less willing to participate in tasks that involve downloading and installing an app, or where data are collected passively. Stated willingness also varies between smartphones and tablets, and between types of respondents: respondents who report higher concerns about the security of data collected with mobile technologies and those who use their devices less intensively are less willing to participate in mobile data collection tasks.","authors":["Alexander Wenz","Annette JÃ¤ckle","Mick P.
