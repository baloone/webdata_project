{"id":"318251208_An_Ontology-based_Context-aware_System_for_Smart_Homes_E-carehome","abstract":"Smart home environments have a significant potential to provide for long-term monitoring of users with special needs in order to promote the possibility to age at home. Such environments are typically equipped with a number of heterogeneous sensors that monitor both health and environmental parameters. This paper presents a framework called E-care@home, consisting of an IoT infrastructure, which provides information with an unambiguous, shared meaning across IoT devices, end-users, relatives, health and care professionals and organizations. We focus on integrating measurements gathered from heterogeneous sources by using ontologies in order to enable semantic interpretation of events and context awareness. Activities are deduced using an incremental answer set solver for stream reasoning. The paper demonstrates the proposed framework using an instantiation of a smart environment that is able to perform context recognition based on the activities and the events occurring in the home.","authors":["Marjan Alirezaie","Jennifer Renoux","Uwe KÃ¶ckemann","Annica Kristoffersson"],"meta":["July 2017Sensors 17(7):1586","DOI:10.3390/s17071586","Project: E-care@home"],"references":["312070160_Context_Recognition_in_Multiple_Occupants_Situations_Detecting_the_Number_of_Agents_in_a_Smart_Home_Environment_with_Simple_Sensors","280102169_Orchestra_Robust_Mesh_Networks_Through_Autonomously_Scheduled_TSCH","271773580_MetaQ_A_knowledge-driven_framework_for_context-aware_activity_recognition_combining_SPARQL_and_OWL_2_activity_patterns","267566519_Internet_of_Things_Strategic_Research_Roadmap","266287969_Role_Of_Middleware_For_Internet_Of_Things_A_Study","265409607_Reasoning_for_Sensor_Data_Interpretation_an_Application_to_Air_Quality_Monitoring","264625181_Automated_Reasoning_using_Abduction_for_Interpretation_of_Medical_Signals","305923709_Uncertainty_reasoning_for_smart_homes_An_ontological_decision_network_based_approach","287702571_Ontology_design_patterns_in_ontology_learning","279422323_Robots_that_help_each_other_self-configuration_of_eistributed_robot_systems"]}
