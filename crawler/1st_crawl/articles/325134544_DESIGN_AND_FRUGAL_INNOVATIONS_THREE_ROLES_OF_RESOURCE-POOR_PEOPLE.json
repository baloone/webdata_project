{"id":"325134544_DESIGN_AND_FRUGAL_INNOVATIONS_THREE_ROLES_OF_RESOURCE-POOR_PEOPLE","abstract":"Design is imperative to satisfy needs of people in resource-limited societies. Many design studies have been carried out in the context of such societies in developing countries, and are discussed under names such as humanitarian engineering, frugal innovations, appropriate technology, design at the Base of the Pyramid, design for development, etc. In this paper, we review a wide range of literature, with close analysis of 30 design studies in this field to understand how marginalised people were engaged and positioned in those studies and to plan for future research in this field.","authors":["Santosh Jagtap","Tobias Larsson"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.21278/idc.2018.0152","Conference: DS92: Proceedings of the DESIGN 2018 15th International Design Conference","Projects: Design for WellbeingMD3S - Model Driven Development and Decision SupportDesign for Resource-Limited Societies"],"references":["316557346_Designing_for_informal_contexts_A_case_study_of_Enkanini_sanitation_intervention","312475191_Towards_A_Framework_for_Holistic_Contextual_Design_for_Low-Resource_Settings","301762456_A_Strategic_Approach_to_Social_Sustainability_-_Part_2_A_Principle-based_Definition","330647250_Designing_the_Right_IT_Services_for_the_Bottom_of_the_Pyramid","321206926_The_Economic_Lives_of_the_Poor","316645445_Social_design_as_a_creative_device_in_developing_countries_The_case_of_a_Handcraft_pottery_community_in_Cambodia","313526263_'The_end_of_corporate_imperialism'","299563129_Making_Sense_of_Global_Health_Governance_A_policy_perspective","295635231_RESEARCH_IN_EXTREME_AFFORDABILITY","294184523_Misfortune_at_the_bottom_of_the_pyramid"]}
