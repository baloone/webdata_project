{"id":"351268717_Automated_Methods_for_Detection_and_Classification_Pneumonia_Based_on_X-Ray_Images_Using_Deep_Learning","abstract":"Recently, researchers, specialists, and companies around the world are rolling out deep learning and image processing-based systems that can fastly process hundreds of X-Ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images to accelerate the diagnosis of pneumonia such as SARS, covid-19, etc., and aid in its containment. Medical image analysis is one of the most promising research areas; it provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of several diseases such as MERS, covid-19, etc. In this paper, we present a comparison of recent deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automatic binary classification of pneumonia images based on fined tuned versions of (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and Xception) and a retraining of a baseline CNN. The proposed work has been tested using chest X-Ray & CT dataset, which contains 6087 images (4504 pneumonia and 1583 normal). As a result, we can conclude that the fine-tuned version of Resnet50 shows highly satisfactory performance with rate of increase in training and testing accuracy (more than 96% of accuracy).","authors":["Khalid Elasnaoui","Chawki Youness","Ali Idri"],"meta":["May 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-74575-2_14","In book: Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain for Future Cybersecurity Applications (pp.257-284)","Project: École Nationale des Sciences Appliquées"],"references":["349468241_Design_ensemble_deep_learning_model_for_pneumonia_disease_classification","341355853_Using_X-ray_Images_and_Deep_Learning_for_Automated_Detection_of_Coronavirus_Disease","340125571_COVID-19_Global_Radiation_Oncology's_Targeted_Response_for_Pandemic_Preparedness","340085806_COVID-19_Epidemiology_Evolution_and_Cross-Disciplinary_Perspectives","340059776_Kidney_disease_is_associated_with_in-hospital_death_of_patients_with_COVID-19","341372349_Extracting_Possibly_Representative_COVID-19_Biomarkers_from_X-ray_Images_with_Deep_Learning_Approach_and_Image_Data_Related_to_Pulmonary_Diseases","340071709_Rapid_viral_diagnosis_and_ambulatory_management_of_suspected_COVID-19_cases_presenting_at_the_infectious_diseases_referral_hospital_in_Marseille_France_-_January_31st_to_March_1st_2020_A_respiratory_v","340046331_SARS-CoV-2_fear_versus_data","340039952_Cardiovascular_Considerations_for_Patients_Health_Care_Workers_and_Health_Systems_During_the_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Pandemic","340030972_Health_security_capacities_in_the_context_of_COVID-19_outbreak_an_analysis_of_International_Health_Regulations_annual_report_data_from_182_countries"]}
