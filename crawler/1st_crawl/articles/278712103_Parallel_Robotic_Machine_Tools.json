{"id":"278712103_Parallel_Robotic_Machine_Tools","abstract":"Global stiffness and optimal calibration are the two crucial issues for parallel robotic machines for their performance, since global stiffness is directly related to the rigidity and accuracy of a parallel robotic machine, while optimal calibration can effectively improve the performance of the parallel robotic machine. In this chapter, both issues will be introduced and discussed. An example of a novel 3DOF parallel robotic machine will be illustrated in the chapter to show the detail of how to implement the global stiffness evaluation and optimal calibration. The method introduced in this chapter is very generic and can be applied in all types of robotic systems.","authors":["Dan Zhang"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4419-1117-9_8","In book: Parallel Robotic Machine Tools (pp.127-138)"],"references":["255584284_Optimal_Calibration_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Machines_ASME_Journal_of_Mechanical_Design","246309479_Genetic_Programs_Data_Structures_Evolution_Programs","220695059_Genetic_AlgorithmData_StructuresEvolution_Programs"]}
