{"id":"220807422_A_survey_of_methods_used_to_evaluate_computer_science_teaching","abstract":"A literature survey shows that the teacher's own impression of the teaching and the students is the most common way of evaluating novelties in teaching. However, also low cost methods with better validity and reliability were found. These included data from several sources, or they comprised of several learning cycles in an iterative development.","authors":["Angela Carbone","Jens Kaasb√∏ll"],"meta":["September 1998ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 30(3):41-45","DOI:10.1145/282991.283014","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Conference on the Teaching of Computing and the 3rd Annual SIGCSE Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 1998, Dublin City Univ., Ireland, 18-21 August 1998"],"references":["311468610_Using_iterative_enhancement_in_undergraduate_software_engineering_courses","311464814_User-level_distributed_file_systems_projects","311464754_The_EOS_laboratory_environment_for_a_course_in_operating_systems","311464688_A_simple_student_environment_for_lightweight_process_concurrent_programming_under_SunOs","304417929_The_quest_for_excellence_in_designing_CS1CS2_assignments","291102538_Methodological_Issues_in_the_Study_of_Programming","269158268_Evaluation_turning_technology_from_toy_to_tool","250182924_Capturing_Craft_Knowledge_in_Teaching","242609254_The_case_for_education_contemporary_approaches_for_using_case_methods","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform"]}
