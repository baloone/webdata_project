{"id":"326876463_Peer_Instruction_Teaching_Methodology_for_Cybersecurity_Education","abstract":"Over the past few years, a team at the University of New Orleans has worked to develop, and evaluate the effectiveness of, a set of 280 questions for three common cybersecurity coursesâ€”Introduction to Computer Security, Digital Forensics, and Network Penetration Testing. We performed a pilot study on a subset of the forensics questions in a workshop and found promising evidence of gains in student learning. The study showed that the students quickly adapted to the format, found it useful, and highly recommended the approach be extended to a wider range of subjects.","authors":["Irfan Ahmed","Vassil Roussev"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine 16(4):88-91","DOI:10.1109/MSP.2018.3111242","Project: Cybersecurity Education"],"references":["221209613_Peer_instruction_Do_students_really_learn_from_peer_discussion_in_computing","2173657_Designing_Effective_Questions_for_Classroom_Response_System_Teaching","347881175_Peer_Instruction_Ten_years_of_experience_and_results","301289286_A_Multi-institutional_Study_of_Peer_Instruction_in_Introductory_Computing","261854838_How_we_teach_impacts_student_learning_Peer_instruction_vs_lecture_in_CS0","260979884_Peer_instruction_in_computer_science_at_small_liberal_arts_colleges","260979805_Can_Peer_Instruction_Be_Effective_in_Upper-Division_Computer_Science_Courses","221537371_Experience_report_Peer_instruction_in_introductory_computing","216743157_Peer_Instruction_Ten_Years_of_Experience_and_Results"]}
