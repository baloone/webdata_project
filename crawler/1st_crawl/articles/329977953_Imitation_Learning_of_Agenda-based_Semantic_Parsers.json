{"id":"329977953_Imitation_Learning_of_Agenda-based_Semantic_Parsers","abstract":"Semantic parsers conventionally construct logical forms bottom-up in a fixed order, resulting in the generation of many extraneous partial logical forms. In this paper, we combine ideas from imitation learning and agenda-based parsing to train a semantic parser that searches partial logical forms in a more strategic order. Empirically, our parser reduces the number of constructed partial logical forms by an order of magnitude, and obtains a 6x-9x speedup over fixed-order parsing, while maintaining comparable accuracy.","authors":["Jonathan Berant","Percy Liang"],"meta":["December 2015Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 3:545-558","DOI:10.1162/tacl_a_00157"],"references":[]}
