{"id":"282269217_Morse_theory_and_persistent_homology_for_topological_analysis_of_3D_images_of_complex_materials","abstract":"We develop topologically accurate and compatible definitions for the skeleton and watershed segmentation of a 3D digital object that are computed by a single algorithm. These definitions are based on a discrete gradient vector field derived from a signed distance transform. This gradient vector field is amenable to topological analysis and simplification via For-man's discrete Morse theory and provides a filtration that can be used as input to persistent homology algorithms. Efficient implementations allow us to process large-scale x-ray micro-CT data of rock cores and other materials.","authors":["Olaf Delgado-Friedrichs","Vanessa Robins","Adrian Sheppard"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025987"],"references":["266149442_Collapses_and_Watersheds_in_Pseudomanifolds_of_Arbitrary_Dimension","247430197_Skeletal_Structures","238808165_Morphological_segmentation","230837989_Use_of_Watersheds_in_Contour_Detection","229400008_Efficient_computation_of_3D_MorseUSmale_complexes_and_persistent_homology_using_discrete_Morse_theory","225778945_Hierarchical_Morse-Smale_Complexes_for_Piecewise_Linear_2-Manifolds","225202520_Optimal_Topological_Simplification_of_Discrete_Functions_on_Surfaces","224313391_New_Characterizations_of_Simple_Points_in_2D_3D_and_4D_Discrete_Spaces","220692408_Computational_Topology_An_Introduction","220566729_Describing_shapes_by_geometrical-topological_properties_of_real_functions","51131057_Theory_and_Algorithms_for_Constructing_Discrete_Morse_Complexes_from_Grayscale_Digital_Images","23456230_A_Practical_Approach_to_Morse-Smale_Complex_Computation_Scalability_and_Generality","7942051_Applications_of_Forman's_discrete_Morse_theory_to_topology_visualization_and_mesh_compression","247448721_Medial_Representations_Mathematics_Algorithms_and_Applications","247446879_Three-dimensional_single_points_serial_erosion_parallel_thinning_and_skeletonization_TR-1005","243769598_Topological_grayscale_watershed_transform","236853750_Morse_Theory_for_Cell_Complexes","223773491_Watershed_of_a_Continuous_Function","222471223_Finite_Topology_and_Image_Analysis","222432485_Ascending_and_descending_regions_of_a_discrete_Morse_function","220659766_Topological_Segmentation_of_Discrete_Surfaces","220632960_Digital_topology_Introduction_and_survey","220182043_Watersheds_in_Digital_Spaces_An_Efficient_Algorithm_Based_on_Immersion_Simulations","45660304_Distance-Driven_Skeletonization_in_Voxel_Images","3191920_Soille_P_Watersheds_in_digital_spaces_an_efficient_algorithm_based_on_immersion_simulations_IEEE_Trans_on_PAMI_136_583-598","2901416_Topological_Grayscale_Watershed_Transformation"]}
