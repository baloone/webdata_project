{"id":"261116902_An_SVM-based_approach_for_stock_market_trend_prediction","abstract":"In this paper, an SVM-based approach is proposed for stock market trend prediction. The proposed approach consists of two parts: feature selection and prediction model. In the feature selection part, a correlation-based SVM filter is applied to rank and select a good subset of financial indexes. And the stock indicators are evaluated based on the ranking. In the prediction model part, a so called quasi-linear SVM is applied to predict stock market movement direction in term of historical data series by using the selected subset of financial indexes as the weighted inputs. The quasi-linear SVM is an SVM with a composite quasi-linear kernel function, which approximates a nonlinear separating boundary by multi-local linear classifiers with interpolation. Experimental results on Taiwan stock market datasets demonstrate that the proposed SVM-based stock market trend prediction method produces better generalization performance over the conventional methods in terms of the hit ratio. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the proposed SVM-based stock market trend prediction system can find out a good subset and evaluate stock indicators which provide useful information for investors.","authors":["Yuling Lin","Haixiang Guo","Jinglu Hu"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706743","Conference: Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2013 International Joint Conference on"],"references":["238747905_A_Hybrid_Machine_Learning_System_for_Stock_Market_Forecasting","225189788_Mining_Stock_Market_Tendency_Using_GA-Based_Support_Vector_Machines","224219912_Local_linear_multi-SVM_method_for_gene_function_classification","220343914_Soft_Margins_for_AdaBoost","220320908_On_Over-fitting_in_Model_Selection_and_Subsequent_Selection_Bias_in_Performance_Evaluation","208813891_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Kernels_for_Coputational_Biology","23442384_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Kernels_for_Computational_Biology","288762061_A_new_support_vector_machine-_genetic_algorithm_SVM-GA_based_method_for_stock_market_forecasting","266348814_A_Comparison_of_PNN_and_SVM_for_Stock_Market_Trend_Prediction_using_Economic_and_Technical_Information","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","234021438_Applied_Multiple_RegressionCorrelation_Analysis_For_The_Behavioral_Sciences","232627133_An_Efficient_K-Means_Clustering_Algorithm_Analysis_and_Implementation","228316791_Value_Investing_The_Use_of_Historical_Financial_Statement_Information_to_Separate_Winners_from_Losers","227783158_Feature_subset_selection_A_correlation-based_SVM_filter_approach","227333491_Linear_Feature-weighted_Support_Vector_Machine","224300810_A_Novel_Feature_Selection_Approach_Using_Classification_Complexity_for_SVM_of_Stock_Market_Trend_Prediction","223855375_Using_support_vector_machine_with_a_hybrid_feature_selection_method_to_the_stock_trend_prediction","223710682_Dynamically_exploring_internal_mechanism_of_stock_market_by_fuzzy-based_support_vector_machines_with_high_dimension_input_space_and_genetic_algorithm","222707837_FS_SFS_A_novel_feature_selection_method_for_support_vector_machines","222570103_Forecasting_stock_movement_direction_with_support_vector_machine","222566603_Application_of_wrapper_approach_and_composite_classifier_to_the_stock_trend_prediction","222412995_Combined_MCDM_techniques_for_exploring_stock_selection_based_on_Gordon_model","221997066_The_Nature_of_Satistical_Learning_Theory","221414462_Research_of_Stock_Index_Futures_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Rough_Set_and_Support_Vector_Machine","221086774_An_integrated_Fuzzy-ANP_model_for_value_investing","220380912_Evolving_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Stock_Market_Trend_Mining","220219771_Stock_trend_prediction_based_on_fractal_feature_selection_and_support_vector_machine","6584052_Clustering_by_Passing_Messages_Between_Data_Points"]}
