{"id":"304627020_From_massive_access_to_cooperation_lessons_learned_and_proven_results_of_a_hybrid_xMOOCcMOOC_pedagogical_approach_to_MOOCs","abstract":"The low completion rate for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), averaging 10 % across total enrolment, highlights a need for close analysis of the underlying formative model. The methodology used here involves cooperation among MOOC participants to introduce new resources through social networks and the integration of these resources with previous teacher materials. The paper describes two MOOCs on distinct topics using this methodology and implemented on the same platform. The observed outcomes indicate increased completion rates for both courses as compared with other MOOCs developed on the same platform. Additionally, although participants in the two MOOCs differed in profile and personal goals, they reported similar perceptions of the quality of the learning experience, which was influenced by the knowledge management approach developed in the proposed methodology.","authors":["Ángel Fidalgo Blanco","María Luisa Sein-Echaluce","Francisco José García-Peñalvo"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1186/s41239-016-0024-z"],"references":["301429134_Transferring_knowledge_and_experiences_from_informal_to_formal_learning_contexts","285285386_Assessing_the_impact_of_the_term_MOOC_vs_eLearning_in_scientific_literature_and_dissemination","284189487_Informal_Learning_Recognition_and_Management","283483846_Facebook's_Potential_for_Collaborative_e-Learning","282538739_Model_for_democratisation_of_the_contents_hosted_in_MOOCs","281887213_Methodological_Approach_and_Technological_Framework_to_Break_the_Current_Limitations_of_MOOC_Model","279633767_Epistemological_and_ontological_spirals_From_individual_experience_in_educational_innovation_to_the_organisational_knowledge_in_the_university_sector","277674186_Challenges_in_the_Creation_Development_and_Implementation_of_MOOCs_Web_Science_Course_at_the_University_of_Southampton","277020277_Educational_visions_of_MOOC","284633265_Research_on_students'_evaluations_of_teaching_effectiveness"]}
