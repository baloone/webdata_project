{"id":"230872857_Flatness_and_defect_of_non-linear_systems_introductory_theory_and_examples","abstract":"We introduce flat systems, which are equivalent to linear ones via a special type of feedback called endogenous. Their physical properties are subsumed by a linearizing output and they might be regarded as providing another nonlinear extension of Kalman's controllability. The distance to flatness is measured by a non-negative integer, the defect. We utilize differential algebra where flatness- and defect are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat. We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with n trailers, the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from non-linear physics. A high frequency control strategy is proposed such that the averaged systems become flat.","authors":["Michel Fliess","Jean LÃ©vine","Philippe Martin","Pierre Rouchon"],"meta":["June 1995International Journal of Control 61(6):13-27","DOI:10.1080/00207179508921959","Project: Flat systems"],"references":["288988897_Modelling_and_Nonlinear_Control_of_an_Overhead_Crane","285513052_Sur_les_systemes_non_lineaires_differentiellement_plats","317770018_Remarks_on_Equivalence_and_Linearization_of_Nonlinear_Systems","317726534_Prime_Differential_Ideals_in_Nonlinear_Rational_Control_Systems","316800954_Modern_Geometry_-_Methods_and_Applications","316800881_Algebraic_Methods_in_Nonlinear_Perturbation_Theory","316800400_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","300929797_PRIME_DIFFERENTIAL_IDEALS_IN_NONLINEAR_RATIONAL_CONTROL_SYSTEMS","291105331_SMOOTH_STABILIZING_TIME-VARYING_CONTROL_LAWS_FOR_A_CLASS_OF_NONLINEAR_SYSTEMS_APPLICATION_TO_MOBILE_ROBOTS","283970778_Algorithme_de_structure_filtrations_et_decouplage"]}
