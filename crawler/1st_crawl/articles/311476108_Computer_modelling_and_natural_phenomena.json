{"id":"311476108_Computer_modelling_and_natural_phenomena","abstract":"This provocative synthetic introduction to several research themes aims at stimulating a reflection on our mature science, Informatics, beyond the myths that originated it and that, today, may affect its progress. The awareness of the expressiveness and of the internal limitations of digital computing is a necessary step, within the Computer Science community, to improve the relations to other sciences, where computers are increasingly used as tools. We will briefly hint to simulations problems in Physics and discuss the still prevailing projection of our fantastic machine onto Biological and Cognitive phenomena. The conference lecture will mostly focus on ยง.3.","authors":["Giuseppe Longo"],"meta":["September 2003ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes 28(5):1-5","DOI:10.1145/949952.940072"],"references":["220173302_Geometry_and_concurrency_A_user's_guide","11455594_Shadowing_breakdown_and_large_errors_in_dynamical_simulations_of_physical_systems"]}
