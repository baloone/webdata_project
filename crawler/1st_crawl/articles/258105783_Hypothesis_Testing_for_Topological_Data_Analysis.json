{"id":"258105783_Hypothesis_Testing_for_Topological_Data_Analysis","abstract":"Persistence homology is a vital tool for topological data analysis. Previous\nwork has devel- oped some statistical estimators for characteristics of\ncollections of persistence diagrams. However, tools that provide statistical\ninference for scenarios in which the observations are persistence diagrams are\nnot developed. We propose the use of randomization-style null hypothesis\nsignificance tests (NHST) for these situations. We demonstrate this method to\nanalyze a range of simulated and experimental data.","authors":["Andrew Robinson","Katharine Felicity Turner"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Applied and Computational Topology 1(4)","DOI:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301846125_Extending_Hypothesis_Testing_with_Persistence_Homology_to_Three_or_More_Groups","271726767_Persistent_homology_transform_for_modeling_shapes_and_surfaces","268389192_Describing_High-Order_Statistical_Dependence_Using_Concurrence_Topology_with_Application_to_Functional_MRI_Brain_Data","344951042_Randomization_Tests","309631812_The_Accumulated_Persistence_Function_a_New_Useful_Functional_Summary_Statistic_for_Topological_Data_Analysis_With_a_View_to_Brain_Artery_Trees_and_Spatial_Point_Process_Applications","288090534_Statistical_Inference","281766106_Statistical_topological_data_analysis_using_persistence_landscapes","281418901_Convergence_Rates_for_Persistence_Diagram_Estimation_in_Topological_Data_Analysis","279864523_Principal_Component_Analysis_of_Persistent_Homology_Rank_Functions_with_case_studies_of_Spatial_Point_Patterns_Sphere_Packing_and_Colloids","272467541_A_Cautionary_Example_on_the_Use_of_Second-Order_Methods_for_Analyzing_Point_Patterns"]}
