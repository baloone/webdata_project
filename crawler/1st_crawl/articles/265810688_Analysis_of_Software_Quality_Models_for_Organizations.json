{"id":"265810688_Analysis_of_Software_Quality_Models_for_Organizations","abstract":"Software Quality model is a vital to obtained data so that actions can be taken to improve the performance. Such improvement can be measured quality, increased customer satisfaction and decreased cost of quality. Software metrics and quality models play a pivotal role in measurement of software quality. A number of well known qualities models are used to build quality software. Different researchers have proposed different software quality models to help measure the quality of software products. In our research, we are discussing the different software quality models and compare the software quality models with each other. Also a framework containing steps is proposed by authors. Some recommendations are also framed hereby in the following research paper. Objectives To begin with there are some common objectives:- To analysis various software quality models w.r.t various attributes.  The presence, or absence, of these attributes can be measured objectively.  The degree to which each of these attributes is present reflects the overall quality of the software product.  These attributes facilitate continuous improvement, allowing cause and effect analysis which maps to these attributes, or measure of the attribute.","authors":["Deepshikha Jamwal"],"meta":[],"references":["266179268_Using_Software_Evolvability_Model_for_Evolvability_Analysis","220091927_Victor_R_Basili's_Contributions_to_Software_Quality","235978110_Characteristics_of_Software_Quality","228573456_Demystifying_maintainability","3187692_A_Model_for_Software_Product_Quality"]}
