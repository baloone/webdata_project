{"id":"355411372_Computer_science_teacher_professional_development_and_professional_learning_communities_A_review_of_the_research_literature","abstract":"Background & Context\nMany efforts have been dedicated to building computer science (CS) teacher capacity through offering professional development (PD) programs. Previous reviews indicated the need to offer more continual support for teachers. Recent research has shifted its focus to scaling up PD and sustaining teaching capacity by establishing PLCs for CS teachers.\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to conduct a systematic literature review of recent research on K-12 CS teacher PD, with an explicit exploration of PLCs.\n\nMethod\nBased on 48 selected articles of 41 programs, this study explored features that contributed to the effectiveness of PD, including (1) PD goals, (2) theoretical frameworks and PD models, (3) curriculum and pedagogy, (4) programming tools, (5) program structure and approach, and (6) PD evaluation. We also examined whether and how these programs were dedicated to establishing PLCs.\n\nFindings\nFindings indicate a considerable increase in the number of studies on CS teacher PD . More programs saw the promising roles of PLCs and explored a variety of approaches for community building and promoting teacher learning.\n\nImplications\nPLCs have immense potential for teacher development, including breaking teacher isolation and fostering collaboration. More research can enlighten the efforts for CS teacher preparation and development.","authors":["Lijun Ni","Gillian Bausch","Rebecca Benjamin"],"meta":["October 2021Computer Science Education","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2021.1993666","Projects: CS Pathways RPPCS Pathways"],"references":["339510540_Upper_Elementary_and_Middle_Grade_Teachers'_Perceptions_Concerns_and_Goals_for_Integrating_CS_into_Classrooms","337672593_Didactic_Methods_of_Integrating_Programming_in_Mathematics_in_Primary_School_-_Findings_From_a_Swedish_National_Project","336709713_Teacher_Change_Following_a_Professional_Development_Experience_in_Integrating_Computational_Thinking_into_Elementary_Science","332062131_Ants_Go_Marching-Integrating_Computer_Science_into_Teacher_Professional_Development_with_NetLogo","340879007_Online_Professional_Development_for_High_School_Computer_Science_Teachers_Features_That_Support_an_Equity-Based_Professional_Learning_Community","339907445_Teachers'_Awards_-_an_Incentive_for_Pedagogical_Development_in_Saudi_Arabia","339510709_Code_Connect_Create_The_3C_Professional_Development_Model_to_Support_Computational_Thinking_Infusion","339510535_Project_Scoring_for_Program_Evaluation_and_Teacher_Professional_Development","339171035_Online_Professional_Development_for_High_School_Teachers_Building_the_Capacity_of_a_National_Cadre_of_Teachers_to_Broaden_Participation_in_Computing","336183406_Transformative_learning_for_computer_science_teachers_Examining_how_educators_learn_e-textiles_in_professional_development","331300043_A_Teacher_Workshop_for_Introducing_Computational_Thinking_in_Rural_and_Vulnerable_Environments","330832137_Computer_Science_Education_Online_Content_Modules_and_Professional_Development_for_Secondary_Teachers_in_West_Tennessee-A_Case_Study","331590840_Effects_of_Professional_Development_on_Programming_Knowledge_and_Self-Efficacy","331301974_Helping_K--12_Teachers_Get_Unstuck_with_Scratch_The_Design_of_an_Online_Professional_Learning_Experience","331300596_Increasing_Capacity_for_Computer_Science_Education_in_Rural_Areas_through_a_Large-Scale_Collective_Impact_Model"]}
