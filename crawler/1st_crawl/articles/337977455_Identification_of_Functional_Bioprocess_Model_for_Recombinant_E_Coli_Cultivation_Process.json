{"id":"337977455_Identification_of_Functional_Bioprocess_Model_for_Recombinant_E_Coli_Cultivation_Process","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to introduce an improved Luedekingâ€“Piret model that represents a structurally simple biomass concentration approach. The developed routine provides acceptable accuracy when fitting experimental data that incorporate the target protein concentration of Escherichia coli culture BL21 (DE3) pET28a in fed-batch processes. This paper presents system identification, biomass, and product parameter fitting routines, starting from their roots of origin to the entropy-related development, characterized by robustness and simplicity. A single tuning coefficient allows for the selection of an optimization criterion that serves equally well for higher and lower biomass concentrations. The idea of the paper is to demonstrate that the use of fundamental knowledge can make the general model more common for technological use compared to a sophisticated artificial neural network. Experimental validation of the proposed model involved data analysis of six cultivation experiments compared to 19 experiments used for model fitting and parameter estimation.","authors":["Renaldas Urniezius","Arnas Survyla"],"meta":["December 2019Entropy 21(12):1221","DOI:10.3390/e21121221"],"references":["337101397_Generic_estimator_of_biomass_concentration_for_Escherichia_coli_and_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_fed-batch_cultures_based_on_cumulative_oxygen_consumption_rate","328237768_From_Physics_to_Bioengineering_Microbial_Cultivation_Process_Design_and_Feeding_Rate_Control_Based_on_Relative_Entropy_Using_Nuisance_Time","280493665_PROBABILISTIC_CONVEX_PROGRAMMING_FOR_SEMI-GLOBALLY_OPTIMAL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION","275595192_Comparative_Study_of_Intelligent_Soft-Sensors_for_Bioprocess_State_Estimation","269934760_The_Benefits_of_Soft_Sensor_and_Multi-Rate_Control_for_the_Implementation_of_Wireless_Networked_Control_Systems","302900195_Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error_for_regression_models","290867029_Bioprocess_Modeling_and_Control","280582434_Bioreactor_control_improves_bioprocess_performance","278413777_Using_the_Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error_for_Regression_Models","266829277_Practical_grey-box_process_identification_Theory_and_applications"]}
