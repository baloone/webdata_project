The great complexity of biological systems may well prove to be an in superable block to the achievement of a significant measure of success in the application of conventional mathematical techniques to the analysis of systems. In the same decade of 1970, the Berkeley-psychologist Eleonor Rosch developed the so-called Prototype Theoryon the basis of empirical studies. This theory assumes that people perceive objects in the real world by comparing them to prototypes and then ordering them accordingly. In this way, according to Rosch, word meanings are formed from prototypical details and scenes and then incorporated into lexical contexts depending on the context or situation. It could therefore be assumed that different societies process perceptions differently depending on how they go about solving problems.","authors":["Rudolf Seising","Verónica Sanz"],"meta":["March 2013Fuzzy Sets and Systems 214:1–5","DOI:10.1016/j.fss.2012.11.011","Project: Soft Computing in Humanities and Social Sciences"],"references":["251010535_What_is_Soft_Computing_Bridging_Gaps_for_21st_Century_Science","251010397_What_is_Soft_Computing_Revisiting_Possible_Answers","251010396_A_naive_glance_at_Soft_Computing","322305318_The_Birth_and_Evolution_of_Fuzzy_Logic_A_Personal_PerspectiveParts_1_and_2","321610103_Soft_Computing_in_Humanities_and_Social_Sciences","319393710_Logical_dilemmas_the_life_and_work_of_Kurt_Godel","318889571_What_is_soft_computing-Bridging_gaps_for_21st_Century_Science","318780116_What_is_soft_computing_revisiting_possible_answers","313128874_Vagueness_An_exercise_in_logical_analysis","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","291263141_Toward_fuzziness_in_computer_systems-Fuzzy_algorithms_and_languages","290616211_Fuzzy_Logic_Computing_with_Words","284462342_Fuzzy_Sets_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes","282004300_The_Mismeasure_of_Man","273056287_Artificial_Experts_Social_Knowledge_and_Intelligent_Machines","272722245_The_Logical_Structure_of_the_World_and_Pseudoproblems_in_Philosophy","271528918_The_Selfish_Gene","269555595_How_the_Mind_Works","268246826_Tractatus_logico-philosophicus_With_an_introduction_by_B_Russell","267076448_Views_on_fuzzy_sets_and_systems_from_different_perspectives_Philosophy_and_logic_criticisms_and_applications","265368838_Der_Logische_Aufbau_der_Welt","265147900_Handbook_of_Analytic_Philosophy_of_Medicine","263568014_Artificial_Knowing_Gender_and_the_Thinking_Machine","262525109_Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_London","262255259_Fuzzy_sets_and_systems","261948276_The_Two_Cultures_and_The_Scientific_Revolution","255721212_The_Blind_Watchmaker","253772739_The_Third_Culture_Beyond_the_Scientific_Revolution","243598210_Making_Computers_Think_Like_People","243507322_The_Mismeasure_of_Man","242568285_The_artificial_intelligence_debate_false_starts","242484403_An_Unsolvable_Problem_of_Elementary_Number_Theory","242480333_Hedges_A_Study_in_Meaning_Criteria_and_the_Logic_of_Fuzzy_Concepts","240711012_Book_Reviews_Artificial_Intelligence_The_Very_Idea","239665572_The_Birth_and_Evolution_of_Fuzzy_Logic","239578559_Turing_AM_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungs_problem_Proc_Lond_Math_Soc_Ser_2_42_230-265","239558754_Engineering_Knowledge_The_Construction_of_Knowledge_in_Artificial_Intelligence","239064517_Advanced_in_the_Linguistic_Synthesis_of_Fuzzy_Controller","238686697_A_Fuzzy-Set-Theoretic_Interpretation_of_Linguistic_Hedges","238671873_Building_Large_Knowledge-Based_Systems_Representation_and_Inference_in_CYC","236718596_When_Computers_Were_Women","235184984_L-fuzzy_Sets","234827240_Towards_a_theory_of_fuzzy_systems","234809408_Fuzzy_languages_and_their_relation_to_human_and_machine_intelligence","232850923_Vagueness_An_exercise_in_logical_analysis","231855772_Reasoning_with_Loose_Concepts","229091427_The_Structure_of_Evolutionary_Theory","227039530_Logical_dilemmas_The_life_and_work_of_kurt_godel","226600059_The_Logic_of_Inexact_Concepts","224112343_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_SMC_vol3128-45","223077899_Note_on_Fuzzy_Languages","222875504_Natural_Categories","222456104_Zadeh_LA_The_concept_of_a_linguistic_variable_and_its_application_to_approximate_reasoning_Part_1_Inform_Sci_8_199-249_Part_2_Inform_Sci_8_301-353_Part_3_Inform_Sci_9_43-80","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","221522776_A_New_Direction_in_AI_Toward_a_Computational_Theory_of_Perceptions"]}
