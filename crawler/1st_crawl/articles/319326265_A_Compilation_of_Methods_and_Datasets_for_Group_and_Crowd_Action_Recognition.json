{"id":"319326265_A_Compilation_of_Methods_and_Datasets_for_Group_and_Crowd_Action_Recognition","abstract":"The human behaviour analysis has been a subject of study in various fields of science (e.g. sociology, psychology, computer science). Specifically, the automated understanding of the behaviour of both individuals and groups remains a very challenging problem from the sensor systems to artificial intelligence techniques. Being aware of the extent of the topic, the objective of this paper is to review the state of the art focusing on machine learning techniques and computer vision as sensor system to the artificial intelligence techniques. Moreover, a lack of review comparing the level of abstraction in terms of activities duration is found in the literature. In this paper, a review of the methods and techniques based on machine learning to classify group behaviour in sequence of images is presented. The review takes into account the different levels of understanding and the number of people in the group.","authors":["Luis Felipe Borja","Jorge Azorin-Lopez","Marcelo Saval-Calvo"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Computer Vision and Image Processing 7(3):40-53","DOI:10.4018/IJCVIP.2017070104"],"references":["305654711_Emotion-Based_Crowd_Representation_for_Abnormality_Detection","290379550_Unsupervised_Framework_for_Interactions_Modeling_between_Multiple_Objects","277982265_Spatial_and_temporal_variations_of_feature_tracks_for_crowd_behavior_analysis","314007395_Small_group_people_behavior_analysis_based_on_temporal_recursive_trajectory_identification","309777290_Group_activity_description_and_recognition_based_on_trajectory_analysis_and_neural_networks","308857955_Self-Organizing_Activity_Description_Map_to_represent_and_classify_human_behaviour","308807990_Understanding_pedestrian_behaviors_from_stationary_crowd_groups","304435900_What_are_they_doing_Collective_activity_classification_using_spatio-temporal_relationship_among_people","304408928_Pedestrian_Travel_Time_Estimation_in_Crowded_Scenes","282967555_Detecting_conversational_groups_in_images_and_sequences_A_robust_game-theoretic_approach"]}
