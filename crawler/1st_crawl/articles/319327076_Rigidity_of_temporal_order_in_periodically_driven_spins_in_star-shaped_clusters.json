{"id":"319327076_Rigidity_of_temporal_order_in_periodically_driven_spins_in_star-shaped_clusters","abstract":"We experimentally study the response of an ensemble of small star-shaped clusters of nuclear spin-half moments when subjected to a sequence of inexact $\\pi$ pulses, and show that in the presence of an Ising interaction between the central and the satellite spins, the magnetization shows long-lived period two oscillations just as in the case of $\\pi$ pulses. Experiments are performed on Acetontrile, Trimethyl phosphite and Tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane which contain $N=3$, $9$, and $36$ satellite spins coupled to a central spin. Numerical simulations reveal a semiclassical picture for the system in which the rigidity of the period against inexactness of the $\\pi$ pulse arises from a randomizing effect of the Larmor precession in the background of the mean field magnetization of adjacent spins. The strength of subharmonic peak depends on the number of satellite spins, initial magnetization and the time period of the drive. The periodicity is robust against effects of the thermal bath surrounding the molecules, but the amplitude of the magnetization appears to decay with a time scale that depends on the inexactness of the $\\pi$ pulses. For a generic initial magnetization, the peak strength increases with $N$ indicating a possible time crystalline phase in the limit of a large number of satellite spins.","authors":["Soham Pal","Naveen Nishad","T S Mahesh","G J Sreejith"],"meta":["August 2017Physical Review Letters 120(18)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.180602","Project: Time Crystal"],"references":["315096358_Critical_Time_Crystals_in_Dipolar_Systems","314306028_Prethermal_Phases_of_Matter_Protected_by_Time-Translation_Symmetry","313796761_Strong_Algorithmic_Cooling_in_Large_Star-Topology_Quantum_Registers","279864288_Exponentially_Slow_Heating_in_Periodically_Driven_Many-Body_Systems","266677233_Absence_of_Quantum_Time_Crystals","322929558_31P_NMR_study_of_discrete_time-crystalline_signatures_in_an_ordered_crystal_of_ammonium_dihydrogen_phosphate","322886126_Observation_of_discrete_time-crystalline_signatures_in_an_ordered_dipolar_many-body_system","314355935_The_fate_of_a_discrete_time_crystal_in_an_open_system","309460921_Observation_of_discrete_time-crystalline_order_in_a_disordered_dipolar_many-body_system","308716434_Observation_of_a_Discrete_Time_Crystal","306927741_Floquet_Time_Crystals","306185789_Discrete_Time_Crystals_Rigidity_Criticality_and_Realizations","306005426_Absolute_stability_and_spatiotemporal_long-range_order_in_Floquet_systems","301841330_Parafermion_chain_with_2pik_Floquet_edge_modes","281058876_On_the_phase_structure_of_driven_quantum_systems","258086115_Comment_on_Quantum_Time_Crystals","255887522_SPIN_DYNAMICS_IN_NUCLEAR_MAGNETIC_RESONANCE","247541619_Skeltont_Protein_NMR_Spectroscopy_Principles_and_Practice","233873235_Quantum_Time_Crystals"]}
