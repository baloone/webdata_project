This research investigates the potential of low-cost UAV aerial images to estimate tree height and crown diameter. Two successful flights were carried out in two different seasons corresponding to leaf-off and leaf-on conditions to generate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM), which were further employed in calculation of a Canopy Height Model (CHM). The CHM was used to estimate tree height using low pass and local maximum filters, and crown diameter was estimated based on an Invert Watershed Segmentation (IWS) algorithm. UAV-based tree height and crown diameter estimates were validated against field measurements and resulted in 3.22 m (10.1%) and 0.81 m (7.02%) RMSE, respectively. The results showed high agreement between our estimates and field measurements, with R2=0.808 for tree height and R2=0.923 for crown diameter. Generally, the accuracy of the results was considered acceptable and confirmed the usefulness of this approach for estimating tree heights and crown diameter.","authors":["Vahid Nasiri","Ali A Darvishsefat","Hossein Arefi","Marc Pierrot-Deseilligny"],"meta":["January 2021Canadian Journal of Forest Research 51(7)","DOI:10.1139/cjfr-2020-0125"],"references":["341303903_An_UAV_and_Satellite_Multispectral_Data_Approach_to_Monitor_Water_Quality_in_Small_Reservoirs","335236052_Measuring_Tree_Height_with_Remote_Sensing-A_Comparison_of_Photogrammetric_and_LiDAR_Data_with_Different_Field_Measurements","333469185_Tree_Height_Estimation_of_Forest_Plantation_in_Mountainous_Terrain_from_Bare-Earth_Points_Using_a_DoG-Coupled_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network","332805654_Filtering_Airborne_LiDAR_Data_Through_Complementary_Cloth_Simulation_and_Progressive_TIN_Densification_Filters","332058299_UAV-Based_Photogrammetric_Tree_Height_Measurement_for_Intensive_Forest_Monitoring","331114002_Ground_Classification_of_UAV_Image-based_Point_Clouds_through_Different_Algorithms_Open_Source_vs_Commercial_Software","331042572_Comparison_of_UAV_LiDAR_and_Digital_Aerial_Photogrammetry_Point_Clouds_for_Estimating_Forest_Structural_Attributes_in_Subtropical_Planted_Forests","327113765_Unmanned_Aerial_Systems_UAS_for_environmental_applications_special_issue_preface","343856829_An_investigation_of_tree_extraction_from_UAV-based_photogrammetric_dense_point_cloud","334657905_Potential_of_UAV_photogrammetry_for_characterization_of_forest_canopy_structure_in_uneven-aged_mixed_conifer-broadleaf_forests"]}
