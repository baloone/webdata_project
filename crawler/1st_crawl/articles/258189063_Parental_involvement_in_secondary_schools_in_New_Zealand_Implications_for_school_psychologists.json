{"id":"258189063_Parental_involvement_in_secondary_schools_in_New_Zealand_Implications_for_school_psychologists","abstract":"An extensive international literature now supports the potential of parental involvement (PI) for improving childrenâ€™s academic achievements and social outcomes. This research also suggests that involvement which schools organize themselves is more effective than externally imposed PI programmes. It is therefore important to investigate PI practices in schools so that guidance on effective PI can be based on actual evidence from schools. This article reports the results of a survey of parental involvement (PI) practices in 21 secondary schools in New Zealand. Interviews were conducted with school principals using a schedule that focused on 11 aspects of PI. Analysis of data from the interviews indicates that all 21 secondary schools had a variety of PI practices in place. Notable gaps in PI provision were: a lack of written school policies on PI; the ad hoc nature of the organization of PI by schools; the lack of specific strategies to involve diverse parents; a limited focus on parent education; and, a lack of training for teachers on PI. Implications for improving the practice of PI in secondary schools and for the role of school psychologists in this, are discussed.","authors":["Garry Hornby","Chrystal Witte"],"meta":["October 2010School Psychology International 31(5):495-508","DOI:10.1177/0143034310382611"],"references":["247718714_Grade-Level_Differences_Relations_of_Parental_Teacher_and_Peer_Support_to_Academic_Engagement_and_Achievement_Among_Hong_Kong_Students","345192188_The_Family-School_Partnership_An_Opportunity_to_Promote_the_Learning_Competence_of_All_Students","292839398_Partnering_with_families_and_communities","279905804_The_Family-School_Partnership_An_Opportunity_to_Promote_the_Learning_Competence_of_All_Students","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","270171116_Family_Life_and_School_Achievement_Why_Poor_Black_Children_Succeed_or_Fail","263331533_Parental_School_Involvement_and_Children's_Academic_Achievement_Pragmatics_and_Issues","259444945_Improving_Parental_Involvement","249798032_The_How_Whom_and_Why_of_Parents'_Involvement_in_Children's_Academic_Lives_More_Is_Not_Always_Better","249793567_Promoting_Parent_Involvement_In_Secondary_Schools"]}
