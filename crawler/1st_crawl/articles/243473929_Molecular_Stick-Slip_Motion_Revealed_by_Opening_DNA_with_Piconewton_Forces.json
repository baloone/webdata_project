{"id":"243473929_Molecular_Stick-Slip_Motion_Revealed_by_Opening_DNA_with_Piconewton_Forces","abstract":"We have pulled apart the two strands of a DNA double helix. The forces measured during this process show a sequence specific variation on the piconewton scale. Opening two helical molecules with the same sequence from opposite sides gives two signatures which are not simply related by symmetry. In a theoretical model, this is explained as a molecular stick-slip motion which does not involve instabilities and is determined by the sequence.","authors":["U. Bockelmann","B. Essevaz-Roulet","F.
