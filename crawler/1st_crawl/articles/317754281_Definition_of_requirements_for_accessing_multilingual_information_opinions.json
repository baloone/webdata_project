{"id":"317754281_Definition_of_requirements_for_accessing_multilingual_information_opinions","abstract":"In this paper, we will present a study concerning the understanding of the needs of people using Internet in order to access to multilingual information. In fact, in the framework of AMIS (Accessing Multilingual Information and opinionS), a Chist-Era project, we propose to develop a system which will help to understand the main idea of a video in a foreign language. In order to design a useful system, a survey allowing to specify the profile of potential users of AMIS has been conducted. The study concerned 170 people from different countries: Poland, Spain and France. The sample is composed of people of different ages and different culture and languages.The results, in terms of requirements, achieved from this study show differences depending on how often the people watch the news on TV or review them on the Internet, and on the age of the target group. These concrete results help us in several decisions concerning how to build a realistic architecture of AMIS.","authors":["Jan Derkacz","Mikołaj Igor Leszczuk","Michał Grega","Arian Koźbiał"],"meta":["April 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(1):1-16","DOI:10.1007/s11042-017-4737-3","Project: AMIS:  Access Multilingual Information opinionS"],"references":["305298758_Reuters_Institute_Digital_News_Report_2015","263233660_Patterns_of_Internet_and_Traditional_News_Media_Use_in_a_Networked_Community","237542104_Connecting_and_Disconnecting_With_Civic_Life_Patterns_of_Internet_Use_and_the_Production_of_Social_Capital","227620850_Competition_Between_the_Internet_and_Traditional_News_Media_The_Gratification-Opportunities_Niche_Dimension","222523499_Internet_Adoption_and_Usage_Patterns_Are_Different_Implications_for_the_Digital_Divide","250183767_Testing_Homogeneity_of_Variances","244956855_A_generalized_KRUSKAL-WALLIS_test_for_comparing_K_samples_subject_to_unequal_patterns_of_censorship","243768141_On_The_Kolmogorov-Smirnov_Test_for_Normality_With_Mean_and_Variance_Unknown"]}
