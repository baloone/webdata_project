{"id":"336905808_A_Map_of_Approaches_to_Temporal_Networks","abstract":"The study of temporal networks is motivated by the simple and important observation that just as network structure can affect dynamics, so can structure in time, and just as network topology can teach us about the system in question, so can its temporal characteristics. In many cases, leaving out either one of these components would lead to an incomplete understanding of the system or poor predictions. Including time into network modeling, we argue, inevitably leads researchers away from the trodden paths of network science. Temporal network theory requires something different—new methods, new concepts, new questions—compared to static networks. In this introductory chapter, we give an overview of the ideas that the field of temporal networks has brought forward in the last decade. We also place the contributions to the current volume on this map of temporal-network approaches.","authors":["Petter Holme","Jari Saramäki"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-23495-9_1","In book: Temporal Network Theory (pp.1-24)"],"references":["332786049_Information_diffusion_backbones_in_temporal_networks","324823015_Epidemics_on_dynamic_networks","322991208_Fluctuating_interaction_network_and_time-varying_stability_of_a_natural_fish_community","319895777_Mapping_temporal-network_percolation_to_weighted_static_event_graphs","318359958_Community_Discovery_in_Dynamic_Networks_A_Survey","318352095_Optimizing_sentinel_surveillance_in_temporal_network_epidemiology","317399343_The_Temporal_Event_Graph","310769939_The_many_facets_of_community_detection_in_complex_networks","308899886_A_Guide_to_Temporal_Networks","305492361_The_fundamental_advantages_of_temporal_networks","301873226_Network_dismantling","293797018_Cyber_War_Game_in_Temporal_Networks","286134691_Time_series_analysis_of_temporal_networks","279877086_Memory_and_burstiness_in_dynamic_networks","279864378_Eigenvector-Based_Centrality_Measures_for_Temporal_Networks","278047608_Diffusion_on_networked_systems_is_a_question_of_time_or_structure","266081742_Data_on_face-to-face_contacts_in_an_office_building_suggest_a_low-cost_vaccination_strategy_based_on_community_linkers","265415012_How_memory_generates_heterogeneous_dynamics_in_temporal_networks","264627804_Memory_in_network_flows_and_its_effects_on_spreading_dynamics_and_community_detection","262954106_Spreading_dynamics_on_networks_The_role_of_burstiness_topology_and_non-stationarity","262580508_Birth_and_death_of_links_control_disease_spreading_in_empirical_contact_networks","261921306_Measuring_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_with_High_Resolution","260557701_Effects_of_temporal_correlations_on_cascades_Threshold_models_on_temporal_networks","260131125_Time_varying_networks_and_the_weakness_of_strong_ties","259678641_Analytically_Solvable_Model_of_Spreading_Dynamics_with_Non-Poissonian_Processes","257761069_Abiotic_factors_shape_temporal_variation_in_the_structure_of_an_ant-plant_network","253336087_Bursty_Communication_Patterns_Facilitate_Spreading_in_a_Threshold-Based_Epidemic_Dynamics","240699919_Crisis_effects_on_intraorganizational_computer-based_communication","329926325_Estimating_network_structure_from_unreliable_measurements","326695946_Gaming_Temporal_Networks","324558858_Navigating_temporal_networks","323138200_A_Gillespie_Algorithm_for_Non-Markovian_Stochastic_Processes","318414449_Centrality_measures_in_temporal_networks_with_time_series_analysis","315116484_Ranking_influential_spreaders_is_an_ill-defined_problem","306550789_Fundamental_structures_of_dynamic_social_networks","305350985_Understanding_Large_Temporal_Networks_and_Spatial_Networks_Exploration_Pattern_Searching_Visualization_and_Network_Evolution","285755642_Contrasting_Effects_of_Strong_Ties_on_SIR_and_SIS_Processes_in_Temporal_Networks","283565124_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Link_Prediction_in_Temporal_Uncertain_Social_Networks","280773491_Exploring_Temporal_Networks_with_Greedy_Walks","280773148_Modern_temporal_network_theory_A_colloquium","277921146_Characterizing_Bursts_of_Aggregate_Pairs_With_Individual_Poissonian_Activity_and_Preferential_Mobility","275255063_Epidemic_process_on_activity-driven_modular_networks","270222319_Estimating_inter-event_time_distributions_from_finite_observation_periods_in_communication_networks","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","261732153_Temporal_percolation_in_activity-driven_networks","260556946_Detecting_change_points_in_the_large-scale_structure_of_evolving_networks","260345457_Evaluating_Temporal_Robustness_of_Mobile_Networks","259345679_The_Mathematics_of_Infectious_Diseases","257069062_Controlling_Contagion_Processes_in_Activity_Driven_Networks","250923205_Immunization_strategies_for_epidemic_processes_in_time-varying_contact_networks","236965859_Applications_of_Temporal_Graph_Metrics_to_Real-World_Networks","236914194_Modeling_Human_Dynamics_of_Face-to-Face_Interaction_Networks","236834748_Temporal_Networks_of_Face-to-Face_Human_Interactions","236106077_Bursts_of_Vertex_Activation_and_Epidemics_in_Evolving_Networks","236065351_Predicting_and_controlling_infectious_disease_epidemics_using_temporal_networks"]}
