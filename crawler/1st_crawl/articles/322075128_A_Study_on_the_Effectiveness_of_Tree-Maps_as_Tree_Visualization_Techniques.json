{"id":"322075128_A_Study_on_the_Effectiveness_of_Tree-Maps_as_Tree_Visualization_Techniques","abstract":"Tree Structure visualization techniques are one of the important techniques to support the analysis of large hierarchical structure data. They are typically used as tree structure node-link diagram. However, it is difficult to visualize the content of directories when there are too many child nodes. In this paper, a study on the effectiveness of the tree-maps as tree structure visualization will be presented. Tree-maps are always considered as one of the interesting topic of research in HCI. Therefore, in this paper we will discuss about applying various types of Tree-maps as one of the visualization techniques. First, we will look into current problem faced by Tree structured node-link diagram. We will also look into four main types of tree-maps such as original tree-maps, Circular Tree-maps, Cushion Tree-maps and 3D Tree-maps. Finally, the effectiveness of these tree-maps to visualize the hierarchy of the directory will be investigated by conducting a simple user experiments.","authors":["Lim Kian Long","Lim Chien Hui","Gim Yeong Fook","Wan Mohd Nazmee Zainon"],"meta":["January 2017Procedia Computer Science 124:108-115","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.12.136"],"references":["257417057_ClockMap_Enhancing_Circular_Treemaps_with_Temporal_Glyphs_for_Time-Series_Data","226238525_Linked_treemap_A_3D_treemap-nodelink_layout_for_visualizing_hierarchical_structures","220586657_EncCon_An_Approach_to_Constructing_Interactive_Visualization_of_Large_Hierarchical_Data","30508486_RINGS_A_Technique_for_Visualizing_Large_Hierarchies","4000927_Beamtrees_compact_visualization_of_large_hierarchies","3509204_Tree-Maps_A_Space-Filling_Approach_to_the_Visualization_of_Hierarchical_Information_Structures"]}
