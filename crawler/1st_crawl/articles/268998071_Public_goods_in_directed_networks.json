{"id":"268998071_Public_goods_in_directed_networks","abstract":"We study the provision of a public good in a social network where links are directed, i.e., the information flows one way. Our results relate, through stochastic dominance, the equilibrium outcome of such a process with the out-degree distribution of the network.","authors":["Dunia LÃ³pez Pintado"],"meta":["November 2013Economics Letters 121(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.econlet.2013.08.003"],"references":["6475905_A_simulation_study_comparing_aberration_detection_algorithms_for_syndromic_surveillance","4749945_Relating_Network_Structure_to_Diffusion_Properties_through_Stochastic_Dominance","279411424_Contagion","222684114_Diffusion_in_Complex_Social_Networks","222662166_Public_Goods_in_Networks","51992875_Social_and_Economic_Networks","46538541_Influencing_the_Influencers_A_Theory_of_Strategic_Diffusion","46455273_Influence_Networks","23536239_The_Spread_of_Free-Riding_Behavior_in_a_Social_Network"]}
