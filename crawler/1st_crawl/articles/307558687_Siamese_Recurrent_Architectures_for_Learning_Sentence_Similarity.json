{"id":"307558687_Siamese_Recurrent_Architectures_for_Learning_Sentence_Similarity","abstract":"We present a siamese adaptation of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for labeled data comprised of pairs of variable-length sequences. Our model is applied to as- sess semantic similarity between sentences, where we ex- ceed state of the art, outperforming carefully handcrafted features and recently proposed neural network systems of greater complexity. For these applications, we provide word- embedding vectors supplemented with synonymic informa- tion to the LSTMs, which use a fixed size vector to encode the underlying meaning expressed in a sentence (irrespective of the particular wording/syntax). By restricting subsequent operations to rely on a simple Manhattan metric, we compel the sentence representations learned by our model to form a highly structured space whose geometry reflects complex semantic relationships. Our results are the latest in a line of findings that showcase LSTMs as powerful language models capable of tasks requiring intricate understanding.","authors":["Aditya Thyagarajan"],"meta":["November 2015","Conference: AAAI-16"],"references":["284654879_A_Tableau_Prover_for_Natural_Logic_and_Language","267768052_Extracting_Speaker-Specific_Information_with_a_Regularized_Siamese_Deep_Network","264978373_UNAL-NLP_Combining_Soft_Cardinality_Features_for_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_Relatedness_and_Entailment","264629983_The_Meaning_Factory_Formal_Semantics_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailment_and_Determining_Semantic_Similarity","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319770277_Deep_Learning_of_Representations_for_Unsupervised_and_Transfer_Learning","303157903_Visualizing_High-Dimensional_Data_using_t-SNE","301445967_Multi-Perspective_Sentence_Similarity_Modeling_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301409028_ECNU_One_Stone_Two_Birds_Ensemble_of_Heterogenous_Measures_for_Semantic_Relatedness_and_Textual_Entailment","301408986_Illinois-LH_A_Denotational_and_Distributional_Approach_to_Semantics"]}
