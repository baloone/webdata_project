{"id":"272021251_Classification_of_physical_human-robot_interaction_scenarios_to_identify_relevant_requirements","abstract":"This paper presents a classification to describe promising use case scenarios for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) and their requirements from an industrial point of view. While previous surveys also cover use cases for pHRI we try to focus on particular requirements and deduce necessary research efforts. A detailed classification allows the investigation and identification of key requirements and proposals for future research focused on industrial usability.","authors":["Tim Guhl","Steffen Walther"],"meta":["June 2014","Conference: 45th Int.
