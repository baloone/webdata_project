{"id":"346719380_DNA_Ring_Motif_with_Flexible_Joints","abstract":"The invention of DNA origami has expanded the geometric complexity and functionality of DNA nanostructures. Using DNA origami technology, we develop a flexible multi-joint ring motif as a novel self-assembling module. The motif can connect with each other through self-complementary sequences on its segments. The flexible joints can be fixed in a straightened position as desired, thereby allowing the motif to take various shapes. We can adjust the number of flexible joints and the number of connectable segments, thereby enabling programmable self-assembly of the motif. We successfully produced the motif and evaluated several self-assembly patterns. The proposed multi-joint ring motif can provide a novel method for creating functional molecular devices.","authors":["Shiyun Liu","Satoshi Murata","Ibuki Kawamata"],"meta":["October 2020Micromachines 11(11):987","DOI:10.3390/mi11110987"],"references":["329439786_Triangular_DNA_Origami_Tilings","328574273_Paper_Origami-Inspired_Design_and_Actuation_of_DNA_Nanomachines_with_Complex_Motions","321601279_Fractal_assembly_of_micrometre-scale_DNA_origami_arrays_with_arbitrary_patterns","320929550_DNA_nanotechnology","317849258_Reconfiguration_of_DNA_molecular_arrays_driven_by_information_relay","310791033_Uncovering_the_forces_between_nucleosomes_using_DNA_origami","303533794_Programming_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Origami_Honeycomb_Two-Dimensional_Lattices_and_Plasmonic_Metamaterials","298913978_Regulation_at_a_distance_of_biomolecular_interactions_using_a_DNA_origami_nanoactuator","324478469_Complexing_DNA_Origami_Frameworks_through_Sequential_Self-Assembly_Based_on_Directed_Docking","317554424_DNA_Origami_Scaffolds_for_Creating_Higher_Order_Structures"]}
