{"id":"253304145_Symbolic_powers_of_ideals_of_generic_points_in_P3","abstract":"B. Harbourne and C. Huneke conjectured that for any ideal $I$ of fat points in $P^N$ its $r$-th symbolic power $I^{(r)}$ should be contained in $M^{(N-1)r}I^r$, where $M$ denotes the homogeneous maximal ideal in the ring of coordinates of $P^N$. We show that this conjecture holds for the ideal of any number of simple (not fat) points in general position in $P^3$ and for at most $N+1$ simple points in general position in $P^N$. As a corollary we give a positive answer to Chudnovsky Conjecture in the case of generic points in $P^3$.","authors":["Marcin Dumnicki"],"meta":["June 2012Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 216(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.jpaa.2011.12.010"],"references":["50893529_Are_symbolic_powers_highly_evolved","45858610_The_resurgence_of_ideals_of_points_and_the_containment_problem","1895948_Comparing_powers_and_symbolic_powers_of_ideals","266512605_Singular_points_on_complex_hypersurfaces_and_multidimensional_Schwarz_lemma","223150124_An_algorithm_to_bound_the_regularity_and_nonemptiness_of_linear_systems_in_Pn"]}
