{"id":"234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","abstract":"Computational thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation, and analysis in problem-solving [3]. We examine how these ways of thinking take shape for middle and high school youth in a set of NSF-supported programs. We discuss opportunities and challenges in both in-school and after-school contexts. Based on these observations, we present a \"use-modify-create\" framework, representing three phases of students' cognitive and practical activity in computational thinking. We recommend continued investment in the development of CT-rich learning environments, in educators who can facilitate their use, and in research on the broader value of computational thinking.","authors":["Irene Lee","Fred Lane Martin","Jill Denner","Bob Coulter"],"meta":["February 2011ACM Inroads 2(1):32-37","DOI:10.1145/1929887.1929902"],"references":["274377900_Computational_Thinking","274309848_Computational_Thinking","224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","224601115_Ubiquitous_Computational_Thinking","221629475_All_I_really_need_to_know_about_creative_thinking_I_learned_by_studying_how_children_learn_in_kindergarten","221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","270120441_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","221537326_Broadening_participation_through_scalable_game_design","200026149_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience"]}
