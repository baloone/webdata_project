{"id":"235246737_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_Approaches_and_Algorithms","abstract":"Sequences of events, items, or tokens occurring in an ordered metric space appear often in data and the requirement to detect and analyze frequent subsequences is a common problem. Sequential Pattern Mining arose as a subfield of data mining to focus on this field. This article surveys the approaches and algorithms proposed to date.","authors":["Carl H.
