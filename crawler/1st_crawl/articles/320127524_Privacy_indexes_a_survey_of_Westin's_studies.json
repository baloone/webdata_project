{"id":"320127524_Privacy_indexes_a_survey_of_Westin's_studies","abstract":"Since the late 1970â€™s Dr. Alan Westin has conducted over 30 privacy surveys. For each o his surveys, Westing created one or more Privacy Indexes to summarise his results and to show trends in privacy concerns. Many Privacy researchers are interested in using these privacy indexes as benchmarks to which they can compare their own survey results. However, the details of how the indexes were calculated have not been reported except in the original survey reports. These reports were originally distributed in paper form, and many are not longer readily available. We obtained paper copies of five of these survey reports and found a sixth report online. We also found summaries of eight additional reports online. Here we report on the methodology used each year to calculate the privacy indexes and draw some conclusions about which indexes can be used to infer privacy trends.","authors":["Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Lorrie Cranor"],"meta":["September 2017","Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University","Project: Privacy in India"],"references":["268342423_Most_People_Are_Privacy_Pragmatists_Who_While_Concerned_about_Privacy_Will_Sometimes_Trade_It_Off_for_Other_Benefits","247253528_Privacy_and_Survey_Research","246240563_Freebies_and_PrivacyWhat_Net_Users_Think","240027543_Harris-Equifax_Consumer_Privacy_Survey","1961364_Beyond_Concern_Understanding_Net_Users'_Attitudes_About_Online_Privacy"]}
