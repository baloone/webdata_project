{"id":"306021086_Comparing_between_different_approaches_to_solve_the_01_Knapsack_problem","abstract":"Knapsack problem is a surely understood class of optimization\nproblems, which tries to expand the profit of items in a knapsack\nwithout surpassing its capacity, Knapsack can be solved by\nseveral algorithms such like Greedy, dynamic programming,\nBranch & bound etcâ€¦.\nIn this paper we will exhibit a relative investigation of the\nGreedy, dynamic programming, B&B and Genetic algorithms\nregarding of the complexity of time requirements, and the\nrequired programming efforts and compare the total value for\neach of them.\nGreedy and Genetic algorithms can be used to solve the 0-1\nKnapsack problem within a reasonable time complexity. The\nworst-case time complexity (Big-O) of both algorithms is O(N).\nNevertheless, these algorithms cannot find the exact solution to\nthe problem; they are helpful in finding a local optimal result\nonly. Our main contribution here is to test both algorithms\nagainst well-known benchmark data sets and to measure the\naccuracy of the results provided by each algorithm. In other\nwords, we will compare the best local result produced by the\nalgorithm against the real exact optimal result.","authors":["Ameen Shaheen","Azzam Sleit"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Network Security 16(7):1-10","Project: Knapsack problem"],"references":["235630763_The_SB-tree_An_efficient_index_structure_for_joining_spatial_relations","235536271_The_SB-tree_an_index_structure_for_joining_spatial_relations","233620281_An_enhanced_semi-blind_DWT-SVD-based_watermarking_technique_for_digital_images","324632409_Applied_Dynamic_Programming","301192158_The_Knapsack_Problem_and_Straightforward_Optimization_Methods","285787170_An_introduction_to_genetic_algorithms","278851485_The_Dynamic_and_Stochastic_Knapsack_Problem","263047996_Applied_Dynamic_Programming","243784204_Application_of_the_Branch-and-Bound_Technique_to_Some_Flow_Shop_Problems","242932577_Upper_Bounds_and_Algorithms_for_Hard_0-1_Knapsack_Problems"]}
