{"id":"318870058_The_g_-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_locally_twisted_cubes","abstract":"Diagnosability of a multiprocessor system is one important measure of the reliability of interconnection networks. In 2012, Peng et al. proposed the g-good-neighbor diagnosability that restrains every fault-free node containing at least g fault-free neighbors. The locally twisted cube is applied widely. In this paper, we give that the g-good-neighbor diagnosability of is under the PMC model and the MM‚Åé model for and .","authors":["Yunxia Ren","Shiying Wang"],"meta":["August 2017Theoretical Computer Science 697(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.07.030"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","220089257_Edge-fault-tolerant_hamiltonicity_of_locally_twisted_cubes_under_conditional_edge_faults","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","315910131_The_1-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_complete_graphs","313968386_The_2-good-neighbor_2-extra_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_graph_networks_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","309330267_The_2-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graph_networks","308756893_Reliability_of_Complete_Cubic_Networks_under_the_Condition_of_g_-Good-Neighbor","308532539_h-restricted_connectivity_of_locally_twisted_cubes","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","286378923_The_1-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","280929076_The_Effect_of_La_Substitution_on_the_Ferroelectric_Properties_of_Bi4Ti3O12_Ceramics","221450026_The_Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220661251_The_locally_twisted_cubes","220295209_Diagnosability_of_Crossed_Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
