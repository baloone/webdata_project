{"id":"257252350_Distributed_Loop_Computer-Networks_A_Survey","abstract":"Distributed loop computer networks are extensions of the ring networks and are widely used in the design and implementation of local area networks and parallel processing architectures. We give a survey of recent results on this class of interconnection networks. We pay special attention to the actual computation of the minimum diameter and the construction of loop networks which can achieve this optimal number. Some open problems are offered for further investigation.
