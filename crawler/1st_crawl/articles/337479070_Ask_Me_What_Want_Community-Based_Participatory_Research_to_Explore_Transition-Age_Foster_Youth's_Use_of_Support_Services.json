{"id":"337479070_Ask_Me_What_Want_Community-Based_Participatory_Research_to_Explore_Transition-Age_Foster_Youth's_Use_of_Support_Services","abstract":"Transition-age foster youth are a population deserving support, including possible psychological assessment and service provision. The majority of these youth do not receive adequate supports and face difficulties in the transition to adulthood. To understand the challenges and barriers to care, the majority of research relies on adult stakeholders rather than on the voices of youth themselves. This study used community-based participatory research to design and implement a survey of transition-age foster youth to learn about their experiences in foster care, use of professional services, barriers to initiating and continuing services, perspectives on treatment topics and therapist characteristics, and use of informal supports. This study details the methods and application of community-based participatory research with foster youth, and then presents a subset of the results of the survey completed by 84 youth transition-age youth in care. Findings indicate the importance of working towards equitable relationships with youth in care to inform research on youth’s experiences and perceptions. Survey results affirm transition-age foster youth’s desire for autonomy, their resourcefulness, and potential areas where services for these youth could offer more support, particularly during periods of transition.","authors":["Saralyn C.
