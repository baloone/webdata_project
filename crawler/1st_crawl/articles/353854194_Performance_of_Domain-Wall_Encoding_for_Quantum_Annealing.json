{"id":"353854194_Performance_of_Domain-Wall_Encoding_for_Quantum_Annealing","abstract":"In this article, we experimentally test the performance of the recently proposed domain-wall encoding of discrete variables Chancellor, 2019, on Ising model flux qubit quantum annealers. We compare this encoding with the traditional one-hot methods and find that they outperform the one-hot encoding for three different problems at different sizes of both the problem and the variables. From these results, we conclude that the domain-wall encoding yields superior performance against a variety of metrics furthermore; we do not find a single metric by which one hot performs better. We even find that a 2000Q quantum annealer with a drastically less connected hardware graph but using the domain-wall encoding can outperform the next-generation Advantage processor if that processor uses one-hot encoding.","authors":["Jie Chen","Tobias Stollenwerk","Nicholas Chancellor"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1109/TQE.2021.3094280"],"references":["337177257_Duality_in_Quantum_Quenches_and_Classical_Approximation_Algorithms_Pretty_Good_or_Very_Bad","334583983_Domain_wall_encoding_of_discrete_variables_for_quantum_annealing_and_QAOA","332685471_Reverse_quantum_annealing_approach_to_portfolio_optimization_problems","353138162_Testing_a_Quantum_Annealer_as_a_Quantum_Thermal_Sampler","350413906_Two_quantum_Ising_algorithms_for_the_shortest-vector_problem","347545535_Fluctuation-guided_search_in_quantum_annealing","347378352_Quantum_Shuttle_traffic_navigation_with_Quantum_computing","346789349_Toward_Quantum_Gate-Model_Heuristics_for_Real-World_Planning_Problems","335901831_Quantum_Annealing_with_Longitudinal_Bias_Fields","332660327_Power_of_Pausing_Advancing_Understanding_of_Thermalization_in_Experimental_Quantum_Annealers"]}
