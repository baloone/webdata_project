{"id":"263930024_Even_faster_integer_multiplication","abstract":"We give a new proof of F\\\"urer's bound for the cost of multiplying n-bit\nintegers in the bit complexity model. Unlike F\\\"urer, our method does not\nrequire constructing special coefficient rings with \"fast\" roots of unity.\nMoreover, we prove the more explicit bound O(n log n K^(log^* n))$ with K = 8.\nWe show that an optimised variant of F\\\"urer's algorithm achieves only K = 16,\nsuggesting that the new algorithm is faster than F\\\"urer's by a factor of\n2^(log^* n). Assuming standard conjectures about the distribution of Mersenne\nprimes, we give yet another algorithm that achieves K = 4.","authors":["David Harvey","Joris van der Hoeven","Gr√©goire Lecerf"],"meta":["July 2014Journal of Complexity 36(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jco.2016.03.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319394757_Multiplication_of_Multidigit_Numbers_by_Automata","303492589_The_fast_fourier_transform_in_a_finite_field","303161861_On_the_least_prime_in_an_arithmetic_progression_II_The_Deuring-Heilbronn_phenomenon","268829272_Divisors_of_Mersenne_Numbers","268309402_p-adic_Numbers_An_Introduction","267053490_On_the_least_prime_in_an_arithmetic_progression_and_estimates_for_the_zeros_of_Dirichlet_L-functions","266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","265544831_On_the_least_prime_in_an_arithmetic_progression_I_The_basic_theorem","265544662_On_the_least_prime_in_an_arithmetic_progression_II_The_Deuring-Heilbronn_theorem","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra"]}
