{"id":"260799028_Random_assemblies_of_microelectrodes_RAM_TM_electrodes_for_electrochemical_studies","abstract":"The application of random assemblies of microdisks (RAMâ„¢ electrodes) to electrochemical studies is described. These devices have working surfaces intersected by hundreds or thousands of disk-shaped microelectrodes that are capacitively, resistively, and diffusively independent. They therefore produce current-time responses of the same form as single microelectrodes, but many times larger. This property allows experimental data to be obtained on the benchtop without shielding and without significant mains interference - something that is impossible with single microelectrodes. The design criteria of random assemblies are summarized, and examples of their utility in a wide range of electrochemical experiments are given.","authors":["S Fletcher","Michael David Horne"],"meta":["October 1999Electrochemistry Communications 1(10):502-512"],"references":["293365596_Preparation_and_Characterization_of_Arrays_of_Novel_Nanometer-Scale_Electrodes","244683125_Ohmic_Interactions_within_Electrode_Ensembles","244455630_Electrochemical_characterization_of_a_microcellular_carbon_foamepoxy_composite_electrode","244091416_Digital_simulation_of_chronopotentiometric_and_steady-state_voltammetric_curves_at_microelectrodes_in_the_presence_of_a_low_concentration_of_supporting_electrolyte","244091186_Modelling_electrode_reactions_using_the_strongly_implicit_procedure","244090197_A_reference_half-cell_capillary_that_improves_the_high_frequency_performance_of_the_potentiostatwhole-cell_combination"]}
