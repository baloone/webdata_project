{"id":"266969591_Are_secondary_preservice_teachers_well_prepared_to_teach_with_technology_A_case_study_from_China","abstract":"This case study investigates how well secondary preservice teachers are prepared to\nuse technology in teaching in China. The study focuses on a teacher education\nprogram that is a representative of many of those in mid-sized Chinese universities. It\nexamines participantsâ€™ experiences with, perspectives of, and expectations about the\nuse of technology and the training they are receiving in this area. Data collected\nthrough survey and interviews indicate that research participants have similar\nperspectives regarding the use of technology in teaching and the integration of\ntechnology in teacher education as their counterparts elsewhere. They reported an\noverall low level of ability to use technology and shared some concerns with the\ntechnology training they received from the teacher education program.","authors":["George Zhou"],"meta":["January 2011Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 27(6):943-960"],"references":["277056241_ICT_in_teacher_education_Examining_needs_expectations_and_attitudes","277054202_Online_professional_development_for_inservice_teachers_in_Information_and_Communication_Technology_Potentials_and_challenges","271503973_Effects_of_an_Educational_Computing_Course_on_Preservice_and_Inservice_Teachers_A_Discussion_and_Analysis_of_Attitudes_and_Use","268056552_Faculty_Adoption_of_Teaching_and_Learning_Technologies_Contrasting_Earlier_Adopters_and_Mainstream_Faculty","266969945_Enhancing_Conceptual_Learning_Through_Computer-Based_Applets_The_Effectiveness_and_Implications","266969508_Adoption_of_educational_technology_ten_years_after_setting_strategic_goals_A_Canadian_university_case","298573718_Examining_teacher_technology_use_Implications_for_preservice_and_Inservice_teacher_preparation_vol_54_pg_297_2003","277254866_Developing_leadership_potential_for_technology_integration_Perspectives_of_three_beginning_teachers","271400388_Educational_Computing_Concerns_of_Postsecondary_Faculty","267971817_Implementing_Web-based_Scientific_Inquiry_in_Preservice_Science_Methods_Courses"]}
