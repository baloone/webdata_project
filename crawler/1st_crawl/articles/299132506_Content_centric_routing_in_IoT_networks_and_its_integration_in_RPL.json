{"id":"299132506_Content_centric_routing_in_IoT_networks_and_its_integration_in_RPL","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) networks can be used for many applications across different industry domains including infrastructure monitoring, civil service, security and surveillance applications etc. However, gathering large amounts of data from such networks including images and videos often cause traffic congestion in the central network area. In order to solve this problem, we proposed the content centric routing (CCR) technology, where routing paths are determined by content. By routing the correlated data to intermediate relay nodes for processing, a higher data aggregation ratio can be obtained, hence effectively reducing the traffic in the network. As a result, significant latency reduction can be achieved. Moreover, redundant data transmissions can also be eliminated after data aggregation which reduces the energy consumption spent predominantly on wireless communication thereby conserving limited battery. CCR was further integrated with the IETF RPL protocol and implemented in Contiki OS using the TelosB platform. Finally, both simulation and implementation results prove the superior performance of CCR in terms of low network latency, high energy efficiency, and high reliability.","authors":["Yichao Jin","Sedat Gormus","Parag Kulkarni","Mahesh Sooriyabandara"],"meta":["March 2016Computer Communications 89-90","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2016.03.005"],"references":["263094103_Constructing_Load-Balanced_Data_Aggregation_Trees_in_Probabilistic_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","303073015_Nameddata_aggregation_in_wireless_sensor_networks","286455013_A_Review_on_Content_Centric_Networking_and_Caching_Strategies","280287730_A_High-Throughput_Path_Metric_for_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Routing","277685820_TAG","277679415_Named_Data_Networking","268741882_Link_Quality_Aware_and_Content_Centric_Data_Aggregation_in_Lossy_Wireless_Networks","257252434_Continuous_Data_Aggregation_and_Capacity_in_Probabilistic_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","255701344_A_Survey_of_Information-Centric_Networking_Research","234766497_Power_efficient_data_gathering_and_aggregation_in_wireless_sensor_networks","232657310_DRINA_A_Lightweight_and_Reliable_Routing_Approach_for_In-Network_Aggregation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224266595_Wireless_Distributed_Computing_A_Survey_of_Research_Challenges","224133135_Constructing_Maximum-Lifetime_Data-Gathering_Forests_in_Sensor_Networks","224259638_An_Energy-Efficient_Clustering_Solution_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224152400_Constructing_Maximum-Lifetime_Data_Gathering_Trees_in_Sensor_Networks_with_Data_Aggregation"]}
