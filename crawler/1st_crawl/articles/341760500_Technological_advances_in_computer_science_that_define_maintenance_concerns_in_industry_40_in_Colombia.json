{"id":"341760500_Technological_advances_in_computer_science_that_define_maintenance_concerns_in_industry_40_in_Colombia","abstract":"Maintenance during industrial development has evolved and adapted to each challenge presented. The progress and development of computer science have opted for the massive use of information and communication technologies that arise in industrial processes generating new possibilities in maintenance management and operation. In Colombia, public and private organizations have carried out exhaustive studies on the use and maturation of technology in different industrial sectors. These studies provide valuable information on the technological progress of the country and the gaps that exist to achieve a competitive country globally. These data were analyzed and purchased with the relevance that maintenance has in Colombian industries and with current maintenance management techniques focused on improving decision making within organizations. This research establishes, within a timeline, the concerns that in the short, medium and long term should meet the maintenance in the so-called industry 4.0 in Colombia contributing to the country’s industry in improving one of its nerve processes to have companies sustainable and competitive.","authors":["Leidy Marcela Dueñas Ramirez","G A Villegas López"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1513(1):012010","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1513/1/012010"],"references":["309656644_Collaborative_Maintenance_in_flow-line_Manufacturing_Environments_An_Industry_40_Approach","283536809_Industrial_Big_Data_Analytics_and_Cyber-physical_Systems_for_Future_Maintenance_Service_Innovation","277612156_Wavelength_and_model_selection_for_hyperspectral_imaging_of_tissue_oxygen_saturation","262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","223659433_The_role_of_maintenance_in_improving_companies'_productivity_and_profitability"]}
