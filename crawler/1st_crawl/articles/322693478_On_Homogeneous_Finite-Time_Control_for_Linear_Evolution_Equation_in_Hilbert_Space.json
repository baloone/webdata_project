{"id":"322693478_On_Homogeneous_Finite-Time_Control_for_Linear_Evolution_Equation_in_Hilbert_Space","abstract":"Based on the notion of generalized homogeneity, a new algorithm of feedback control design is developed for a plant modeled by a linear evolution equation in a Hilbert space with a possibly unbounded operator. The designed control law steers any solution of the closed-loop system to zero in a finite time. Method of homogeneous extension is presented in order to make the developed control design principles to be applicable for evolution systems with non-homogeneous operators. The design scheme is demonstrated for heat equation with the control input distributed on the segment [0,1].","authors":["Andrey Polyakov","Jean-Michel Coron","Lionel Rosier"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2018.2797838"],"references":["316734973_Null_Controllability_and_Finite_Time_Stabilization_for_the_Heat_Equations_with_Variable_Coefficients_in_Space_in_One_Dimension_via_Backstepping_Approach","312325928_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_observers_design_via_implicit_Lyapunov_function","312110558_On_finite-time_stabilization_of_evolution_equations_A_homogeneous_approach","308734078_Finite-time_backstepping_boundary_stabilization_of_3_3_hyperbolic_systems","293014912_On_Homogeneous_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284677648_A_general_approach_to_synthesis_problem","284491471_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_uniform_homogeneous_right-hand_sides","283519590_Stabilization_and_controllability_of_first-order_integro-differential_hyperbolic_equations","271141391_Robust_Stabilization_of_MIMO_Systems_in_FiniteFixed_Time"]}
