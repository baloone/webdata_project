{"id":"305851301_Vision_applications_and_future_challenges_of_Internet_of_Things_A_bibliometric_study_of_the_recent_literature","abstract":"Abstract\n\nPurpose – The emergent field of Internet of Things (IoT) has been evolving rapidly with a geometric\ngrowth in the number of academic publications in this field. The purpose of this paper is to review the\nliterature of IoT in past 16 years using rigorous bibliometric and network analysis tools, offering at\nthe same time future directions for the IoT research community and implications for managers and\ndecision makers.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach – The authors adopted the techniques of bibliometric and\nnetwork analysis. The paper reviewed the articles published on IoT from 2000 to 2015.\n\nFindings – This study identifies top contributing authors; key research topics related to the field; the\nmost influential works based on citations and PageRank; and established and emerging research\nclusters. Scholars are encouraged to further explore this topic.\n\nResearch limitations/implications – This study focuses only on vision and applications of IoT.\nScholars may explore various other aspects of this area of research.\n\nOriginality/value – To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to review the literature\non IoT by using bibliometric and network analysis techniques. The study is unique as it spans a long\ntime period of 16 years (2000-2015). The study proposes a five-cluster classification of research themes\nthat may inform current and future research in IoT.","authors":["Deepa Mishra Bhatt"],"meta":["August 2016Industrial Management & Data Systems 116(7):1331 - 1355","DOI:10.1108/IMDS-11-2015-0478"],"references":["319393385_Towards_the_Web_of_Things_Web_Mashups_for_Embedded_Devices","285473885_How_to_use_Bibexcel_for_various_types_of_bibliometric_analysis","283858920_Exploring_regulations_and_scope_of_the_Internet_of_Things_in_contemporary_companies_a_first_literature_analysis","283826300_Landmark_recognition_in_VISITO_Tuscany","281395968_Spurring_Impactful_Research_on_Information_Systems_and_Environmental_Sustainability","280527542_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Literature_Review","272752509_BibliometricsCitation_networks","271921561_The_Internet_of_Things-A_survey_of_topics_and_trends","267566519_Internet_of_Things_Strategic_Research_Roadmap","267325656_Interdependencies_and_Supply_Chain_Bipolar_Strategies_Between_Co-Opetition_and_Cooperation","264589945_Research_Directions_for_the_Internet_of_Things","262150778_An_Information_Framework_for_Creating_a_Smart_City_Through_Internet_of_Things","260540297_Internet_of_Things_for_Smart_Cities","259639949_Enabling_Smart_Cities_through_a_Cognitive_Management_Framework_for_the_Internet_of_Things","250893781_Flood_decision_support_system_on_agent_grid_Method_and_implementation","236627583_Context_Aware_Computing_for_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","236032563_Theoretical_perspectives_in_purchasing_and_supply_chain_management_An_analysis_of_the_literature","235642544_Embedded_Interaction_Interacting_with_the_Internet_of_Things","234829343_Introduction_Service-oriented_computing","233987048_The_Social_Internet_of_Things_SIoT_-_When_social_networks_meet_the_Internet_of_Things_Concept_architecture_and_network_characterization","233407318_The_Laplacian_spectrum_of_graphs","304533565_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networksJ","301888287_That_'Internet_of_Things'_Thing","291974616_World_Class_Sustainable_Supply_Chain_Management_critical_review_and_further_research_directions","290714298_Navigation_in_a_small_world","285866820_The_Fog_Computing_Paradigm_Scenarios_and_Security_Issues","284054831_The_internet_of_things","271517931_Green_Supply_Chain_Management_A_Review_and_Bibliometric_Analysis","269031887_The_Sybil_attack_in_sensor_networks_Analysis_defenses","268191226_An_SDN_based_management_framework_for_IoT_devices","267454881_The_Internet_of_Things_vision_Key_features_applications_and_open_issues","263478732_Agent-Based_Supply_Chain_Integration","263468169_RFID_in_the_warehouse_A_literature_analysis_1995-2010_of_its_applications_benefits_challenges_and_future_trends","262319902_A_Critical_Point_for_Random_Graphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","261370490_Renaissance_of_Case_Research_as_a_Scientific_Method","261246314_Smart_parking_solutions_for_urban_areas","261040024_Automotive_Ethernet_In-vehicle_Networking_and_Smart_Mobility","260584109_Cyberentity_Security_in_the_Internet_of_Things","259126626_Citation_analysis_A_social_and_dynamic_approach_to_knowledge_organization","256942157_Geographic_converge_cast_using_mobile_Sink_in_wireless_sensor_networks","256942134_Cyber-physical_systems_Milestones_and_research_challenges","251929234_Research_on_the_Innovation_of_Strategic_Business_Model_in_Green_Agricultural_Products_Based_on_Internet_of_Things_IOT","251194224_Adding_sense_to_the_Internet_of_Things","247716445_The_Relative_Importance_of_Journals_Used_in_Management_Research_An_Alternative_Ranking","246850582_Changes_in_The_Intellectual_Structure_of_Strategic_Management_Research","242020866_Operations_management_research_Contemporary_themes_trends_and_potential_future_directions","241079966_A_new_strategy_for_harnessing_knowledge_management_in_e-commerce","235642082_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Applications_and_Research_Challenges","235275946_Is_Production_and_Operations_Management_a_Discipline_A_CitationCo-Citation_Study","233191671_Information_Architecture_for_Supply_Chain_Quality_Management","232637383_A_Novel_Scheme_for_Mobile_Payment_using_RFID-enabled_Smart_SIMcard","230578568_Bridging_Practice_and_Theory_A_Design_Science_Approach","232870065_Prototyping_an_information_system's_requirements_architecture_for_customer-driven_supply-chain_operations","232414606_Looking_ahead_in_pervasive_computing_Challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_era_of_cyber-physical_convergence","229423406_A_literature_review_on_the_impact_of_RFID_technologies_on_supply_chain_management"]}
