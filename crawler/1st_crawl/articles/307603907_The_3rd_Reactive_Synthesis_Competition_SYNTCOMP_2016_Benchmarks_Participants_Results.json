{"id":"307603907_The_3rd_Reactive_Synthesis_Competition_SYNTCOMP_2016_Benchmarks_Participants_Results","abstract":"We report on the benchmarks, participants and results of the third reactive synthesis competition (SYNTCOMP 2016). The benchmark library of SYNTCOMP 2016 has been extended to benchmarks in the new LTL-based temporal logic synthesis format (TLSF), and 2 new sets of benchmarks for the existing AIGER-based format for safety specifications. The participants of SYNTCOMP 2016 can be separated according to these two classes of specifications, and we give an overview of the 6 tools that entered the competition in the AIGER-based track, and the 3 participants that entered the TLSF-based track. We briefly describe the benchmark selection, evaluation scheme and the experimental setup of SYNTCOMP 2016. Finally, we present and analyze the results of our experimental evaluation, including a comparison to participants of previous competitions and a legacy tool.","authors":["Swen Jacobs","Roderick Bloem","Romain Brenguier","Ayrat Khalimov"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.229.12"],"references":["310733101_A_High-Level_LTL_Synthesis_Format_TLSF_v11","306182523_The_first_reactive_synthesis_competition_SYNTCOMP_2014","292150846_Hardware_Model_Checking_Competition_2014_An_Analysis_and_Comparison_of_Solvers_and_Benchmarks","310733012_The_Reactive_Synthesis_Competition_SYNTCOMP_2016_and_Beyond","308925701_LtlNfBa_Making_LTL_Translation_More_Practical","305253131_A_SAT-Based_Counterexample_Guided_Method_for_Unbounded_Synthesis","301960053_Solving_QBF_by_Abstraction","300651005_Algorithms_for_Model_Checking_HyperLTL_and_HyperCTL","292670304_Compositional_Algorithms_for_Succinct_Safety_Games","292670279_Specification_Format_for_Reactive_Synthesis_Problems","279458507_The_first_reactive_synthesis_competition_SYNTCOMP_2014","266723056_User-Guided_Device_Driver_Synthesis","264944097_PeRIPLO_A_Framework_for_Producing_Effective_Interpolants_in_SAT-Based_Software_Verification","290368238_Towards_Efficient_Parameterized_Synthesis","285344332_Symbolic_bounded_synthesis"]}
