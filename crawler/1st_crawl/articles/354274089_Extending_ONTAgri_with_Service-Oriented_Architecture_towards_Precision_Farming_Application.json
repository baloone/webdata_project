{"id":"354274089_Extending_ONTAgri_with_Service-Oriented_Architecture_towards_Precision_Farming_Application","abstract":"The computer science perspective of ontology refers to ontology as a technology, however, with a different perspective in terms of interrogations and concentrations to construct engineering models of reality. Agriculture-centered architectures are among rich sources of knowledge that are developed, preserved, and released for farmers and agro professionals. Many researchers have developed different variants of existing ontology-based information systems. These systems are primarily picked agriculture-related ontological strategies based on activities such as crops, weeds, implantation, irrigation, and planting, to name a few. By considering the limitations on agricultural resources in the ONTAgri scenario, in this paper, an extension of ontology is proposed. The extended ONTAgri is a service-oriented architecture that connects precision farming with both local and global decision-making methods. These decision-making methods are connected with the Internet of Things systems in parallel for the input processing of system ontology. The proposed architecture fulfills the requirements of Agriculture 4.0. The significance of the proposed approach aiming to solve a multitude of agricultural problems being faced by the farmers is successfully demonstrated through SPARQL queries.","authors":["Muhammad Fahad","Tariq Javid","Hira Beenish","Adnan Ahmed Siddiqui"],"meta":["August 2021Sustainability 13(17):9801","DOI:10.3390/su13179801"],"references":["352182344_A_Framework_for_Evaluating_Agricultural_Ontologies","343188954_Learning_from_Data_to_Optimize_Control_in_Precision_Farming","342510526_Semantic_and_Syntactic_Interoperability_for_Agricultural_Open-Data_Platforms_in_the_Context_of_IoT_Using_Crop-Specific_Trait_Ontologies","340254976_A_Long-range_Context-aware_Platform_Design_For_Rural_Monitoring_With_IoT_In_Precision_Agriculture","339421804_Deep_Learning_Predictor_for_Sustainable_Precision_Agriculture_Based_on_Internet_of_Things_System","338939306_Adoption_of_Precision_Farming_Tools_The_Case_of_Italian_Farmers","338770474_A_Context-Aware_Middleware_Cloud_Approach_for_Integrating_Precision_Farming_Facilities_into_the_IoT_toward_Agriculture_40","338048970_Applying_Ontology_Knowledge_Representation_Technology_and_Semantic_Searching_Methods_to_Support_the_Production_of_High_Quality_Longan_Fruit","337705380_SAAONT_Ontological_knowledge-based_development_to_support_intelligent_decision-making_systems_for_Saudi_Arabian_agriculture","338089371_Ontology_engineering_Current_state_challenges_and_future_directions","332949198_Study_of_Wireless_Communication_Technologies_on_Internet_of_Things_for_Precision_Agriculture","314288067_Performance_and_Challenges_of_Service-Oriented_Architecture_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","334947635_Rules_engine_and_complex_event_processor_in_the_context_of_internet_of_things_for_precision_agriculture","327373270_Agricultural_recommendation_system_for_crop_protection","326462507_Internet_of_Underground_Things_in_Precision_Agriculture_Architecture_and_Technology_Aspects"]}
