{"id":"305805518_Physically_Based_Building_Load_Model_for_Electric_Grid_Operation_and_Planning","abstract":"This paper describes a building electrical-thermal load model that is both suitable for power system analysis as well as retains essential thermodynamic information. The model is developed using observations made over multiple time windows to elicit both steady state characteristics, for planning, as well as dynamic behavior, for demand side control applications. Consequently, multiple model evolutions based on data availability are presented. Physically-based parameters are used in the modeling process to describe the influence of building automation systems on the electrical load profile. The end goal is to provide an improved understanding of building temperature-load interactions to facilitate more efficient use of buildings as demand side resources.","authors":["Mohammed K.
