{"id":"265731893_Query_reverse_engineering","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new problem termed query reverse engineering (QRE). Given a database \\(D\\) and a result table \\(T\\) —the output of some known or unknown query \\(Q\\) on \\(D\\) —the goal of QRE is to reverse-engineer a query \\(Q'\\) such that the output of query \\(Q'\\) on database \\(D\\) (denoted by \\(Q'(D)\\) ) is equal to \\(T\\) (i.e., \\(Q(D)\\) ). The QRE problem has useful applications in database usability, data analysis, and data security. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach, TALOS for Tree-based classifier with At Least One Semantics, that is based on a novel dynamic data classification formulation and extend the approach to efficiently support the three key dimensions of the QRE problem: whether the input query is known/unknown, supporting different query fragments, and supporting multiple database versions.","authors":["Quoc Trung Tran","Chee-Yong Chan","Srinivasan Parthasarathy"],"meta":["October 2014The VLDB Journal 23(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00778-013-0349-3"],"references":["226388534_SLIQ_A_fast_scalable_classifier_for_data_mining","221654447_Turning_CARTwheels_An_alternating_algorithm_for_mining_redescriptions","221310173_GORDIAN_Efficient_and_scalable_discovery_of_composite_keys","221215070_Information-Theoretic_Tools_for_Mining_Database_Structure_from_Large_Data_Sets","221214740_Data_generation_using_declarative_constraints","221214234_Discovering_topical_structures_of_databases","220538797_Output_perturbation_with_query_relaxation","220538545_Generating_Databases_for_Query_Workloads","220266329_Data_Integration_A_Theoretical_Perspective","220072893_Efficient_Classification_across_Multiple_Database_Relations_A_CrossMine_Approach","210096006_QAGen_Generating_query-aware_test_databases","4250935_Reverse_Query_Processing","3297630_Generating_Queries_with_Cardinality_Constraints_for_DBMS_Testing","3297556_Efficient_classification_across_multiple_database_relations_A_CrossMine_approach","2919745_Selectivity_Estimation_using_Probabilistic_Models","2603834_Efficiently_Updating_Materialized_Views","2600427_Maintenance_of_Data_Cubes_and_Summary_Tables_in_a_Warehouse","2403360_Exploiting_Constraint-Like_Data_Characterizations_in_Query_Optimization","1956867_Turning_CARTwheels_An_Alternating_Algorithm_for_Mining_Redescriptions","311472075_Exploiting_constraint-like_data_characterizations_in_query_optimization","305260487_Efficiently_Updating_Materialized_Views","285841570_SLIQ_A_fast_scalable_classifier_for_data_mining","278696779_BHUNT","269034320_Data_integration","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","233882454_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","224131249_Reverse_Engineering_Models_from_Databases_to_Bootstrap_Application_Development","222812561_Modeling_by_shortest_data_description","221322206_Synthesizing_view_definitions_from_data","221311520_BHUNT_Automatic_Discovery_of_Fuzzy_Algebraic_Constraints_in_Relational_Data","221214259_Query_by_output","221213503_Generating_Targeted_Queries_for_Database_Testing","221213122_How_to_ConQueR_why-not_questions","220225253_Join_Indices","200110620_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","3626616_Towards_the_reverse_engineering_of_renormalized_relational_databases","3296456_Intensional_Answers_to_Database_Queries","2896997_Database_Exploration_and_Bellman","2263948_An_Overview_of_Cooperative_Answering","2254111_The_Design_Of_The_Postgres_Storage_System"]}
