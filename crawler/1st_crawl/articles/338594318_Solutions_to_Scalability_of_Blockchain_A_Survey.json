{"id":"338594318_Solutions_to_Scalability_of_Blockchain_A_Survey","abstract":"Blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrencies have drawn much attention and been widely-deployed in recent years. Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain, achieves great success and promotes more development in this field. However, Bitcoin encounters performance problems of low throughput and high transaction latency. Other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work also inherit the flaws, leading to more concerns about the scalability of blockchain. This paper attempts to cover the existing scaling solutions for blockchain and classify them by level. In addition, we make comparisons between different methods and list some potential directions for solving the scalability problem of blockchain.","authors":["Qiheng Zhou","Huawei Huang","Zibin Zheng"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Access PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2967218","Projects: BlockchainScalability of Blockchain"],"references":["336822518_Blockchain_Mutability_Challenges_and_Proposed_Solutions","328271018_Blockchain_challenges_and_opportunities_a_survey","326640486_OmniLedger_A_Secure_Scale-Out_Decentralized_Ledger_via_Sharding","348915483_Anonymous_Multi-Hop_Locks_for_Blockchain_Scalability_and_Interoperability","336945962_Jidar_A_Jigsaw-like_Data_Reduction_Approach_Without_Trust_Assumptions_for_Bitcoin_System","336711368_Kadcast_A_Structured_Approach_to_Broadcast_in_Blockchain_Networks","335362865_Erasing_Data_from_Blockchain_Nodes","334167678_Velocity_Scalability_Improvements_in_Block_Propagation_Through_Rateless_Erasure_Coding","328520365_CUB_a_Consensus_Unit-Based_Storage_Scheme_for_Blockchain_System","328322415_RapidChain_Scaling_Blockchain_via_Full_Sharding"]}
