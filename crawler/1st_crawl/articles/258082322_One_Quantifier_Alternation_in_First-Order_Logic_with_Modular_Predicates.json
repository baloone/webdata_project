{"id":"258082322_One_Quantifier_Alternation_in_First-Order_Logic_with_Modular_Predicates","abstract":"Adding modular predicates yields a generalization of first-order logic FO\nover words. The expressive power of FO[<,MOD] with order comparison $x<y$ and\npredicates for $x \\equiv i \\mod n$ has been investigated by Barrington,\nCompton, Straubing and Therien. The study of FO[<,MOD]-fragments was initiated\nby Chaubard, Pin and Straubing. More recently, Dartois and Paperman showed that\ndefinability in the two-variable fragment FO2[<,MOD] is decidable. In this\npaper we continue this line of work.\nWe give an effective algebraic characterization of the word languages in\nSigma2[<,MOD]. The fragment Sigma2 consists of first-order formulas in prenex\nnormal form with two blocks of quantifiers starting with an existential block.\nIn addition we show that Delta2[<,MOD], the largest subclass of Sigma2[<,MOD]\nwhich is closed under negation, has the same expressive power as two-variable\nlogic FO2[<,MOD]. This generalizes the result FO2[<] = Delta2[<] of Therien and\nWilke to modular predicates. As a byproduct, we obtain another decidable\ncharacterization of FO2[<,MOD].","authors":["Manfred Kufleitner","Tobias Walter"],"meta":["October 2013RAIRO - Theoretical Informatics and Applications 49(1)","DOI:10.1051/ita/2014024","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221590153_Over_Words_Two_Variables_Are_as_Powerful_as_One_Quantifier_Alternation","220980192_On_Logical_Descriptions_of_Regular_Languages","220149460_Algebraic_tools_for_the_concatenation_product","41714770_Some_results_on_C-varieties","344485184_Varieties_of_Formal_Languages","285354751_Homomorphisms_and_semilocal_theory","283926055_Diamonds_are_forever_The_variety_DA","266607122_Expressiveness_and_Succinctness_of_First-Order_Logic_on_Finite_Words","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","244922065_Actions_Wreath_Products_of_C-varieties_and_Concatenation_Product","243677621_Finite_semigroup_varieties_of_the_form_V_D","234798109_Varieties_Of_Formal_Languages","232615365_First_Order_Formulas_with_Modular_Ppredicates","230609019_On_logical_hierarchies_within_FO2-definable_languages","228683863_Semidirect_Products_of_Ordered_Semigroups","228558368_A_variety_theorem_without_complementation","225766945_Regular_Languages_Defined_by_Generalized_First-Order_Formulas_with_a_Bounded_Number_of_Bound_Variables","225608503_Polynomial_Closure_and_Unambiguous_Product","225446869_Regular_Languages_Defined_by_Generalized_First-Order_Formulas_with_a_Bounded_Number_of_Bound_Variables","225158038_The_Height_of_Factorization_Forests","224775792_The_Join_Levels_of_the_Trotter-Weil_Hierarchy_Are_Decidable","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222445123_Classifying_regular_events_in_symbolic_logic","222353880_Operations_polynomiales_et_hierarchies_de_concatenation","222352104_Factorization_forests_of_finite_height","221664423_Lattices_of_Logical_Fragments_over_Words","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events","220898468_Regular_Languages_Defined_with_Generalized_Quantifiers","220544418_Regular_Languages_Defined_by_Generalized_First-Order_Formulas_with_a_Bounded_Number_of_Bound_Variables","220180354_A_Survey_on_Small_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Finite_Words","220165771_Regular_languages_definable_by_Lindstrom_quantifiers","220150628_A_Generalization_of_the_Schutzenberger_Product_of_Finite_Monoids","220149035_Classification_of_Finite_Monoids_The_Language_Approach","220123058_Temporal_Logic_with_Cyclic_Counting_and_the_Degree_of_Aperiodicity_of_Finite_Automata","41701215_Regular_Languages_Definable_by_Lindstrom_Quantifiers","36179974_Tense_Logic_and_the_Theory_of_Linear_Order","34386296_The_Complexity_of_Decision_Problems_in_Automata_Theory_and_Logic","30832783_Regular_languages_in_NC1"]}
