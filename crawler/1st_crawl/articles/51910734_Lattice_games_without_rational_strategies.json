{"id":"51910734_Lattice_games_without_rational_strategies","abstract":"We show that the lattice games of Guo and Miller support universal\ncomputation, disproving their conjecture that all lattice games have rational\nstrategies. We also state an explicit counterexample to that conjecture: a\nthree dimensional lattice game whose set of winning positions does not have a\nrational generating function.","authors":["Alex Fink"],"meta":["June 2011Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 119(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcta.2011.10.005","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221498963_Simple_Computation-Universal_Cellular_Spaces_and_Self-Reproduction","220431575_Simple_Computation-Universal_Cellular_Spaces","2104477_Short_rational_generating_functions_for_lattice_point_problems","285696219_Uber_mathematische_Kampfspiele","285198043_Mathematics_and_games","256937610_Misere_quotients_for_impartial_games","231828613_The_G-values_of_various_games","222544166_Lattice_point_methods_for_combinatorial_games","51893554_Algorithms_for_lattice_games"]}
