{"id":"310820336_Patterns_of_Free-form_Curation_Visual_Thinking_with_Web_Content","abstract":"Web curation involves choosing, organizing, and commenting on content. Popular web curation apps-- e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest-- provide linear feeds that show people the latest content, but provide little support for articulating relationships among content elements. The new medium of free-form web curation enables multimedia elements to be spontaneously gathered from the web, written about, sketched amidst, manipulated, and visually assembled in a continuous space. Through free-form web curation, content is collected, interpreted, and arranged, creating context. We conducted a field study of 1581 students in 6 courses, spanning diverse fields. We derive patterns of free-form curation through a visual grounded theory analysis of the resulting dataset of 4426 curations. From the observed range of invocations of the patterns in the performance of ideation tasks, we conclude that free-form is valuable as a new medium of web curation in how it supports creative visual thinking.","authors":["Nic Lupfer","Andruid Kerne","Andrew Webb","Rhema Linder"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2964284.2964303","Conference: the 2016 ACM"],"references":["311731057_Constructivist_grounded_theory","276125997_Sharing_the_hidden_treasure_in_pictorials","254005114_Talking_about_implications_for_design_in_pattern_language","254004433_Visual_thinking_digital_imagery","233991214_Visual_Grounded_Theory_A_Methodological_Outline_and_Examples_from_Empirical_Work","230587594_A_Century_of_Gestalt_Psychology_in_Visual_Perception_I_Perceptual_Grouping_and_Figure-Ground_Organization","229708186_Visualizing_Thought","228345133_Beyond_Big_and_Little_The_Four_C_Model_of_Creativity","224285723_Information_Visualization_Perception_for_Design_Second_Edition","221629397_The_resourcefulness_of_everyday_design","221441362_Two-Dimensional_Spatial_Positioning_as_a_Means_for_Reflection_in_Design","345850150_Manifestoes_of_Surrealism","344822591_Writing_Space_Computers_Hypertext_and_the_Remediation_of_Print","320353407_Creativity","314115125_Creative_cognition_Theory_research_and_applications","314115047_Creative_cognition_Theory_research_and_applications","304898664_Envisioning_Information","300484523_Beyond_Slideware","288135572_Visual_Sociology","286605490_A_pattern_approach_to_interaction_design","276935749_Reading_Images_A_Grammar_of_Visual_Design","275940939_Semiology_of_Graphics","269948123_Envisioning_Information","269915642_Using_Metrics_of_Curation_to_Evaluate_Information-Based_Ideation","269842161_Envisioning_Information","269494472_The_Art_of_Assemblage","266655586_Everyday_ideation_All_of_my_ideas_are_on_pinterest","265091982_Constructing_Grounded_Theory_A","261289043_The_Timeless_Way_of_Building","256599578_Hypertext_30_Critical_Theory_and_New_Media_in_an_Era_of_Globalization","242530082_Of_two_mindshypertext_pedagogy_and_poetics","237466368_Material_beings_Objecthood_and_ethnographic_photographs","236412034_On_Line_and_on_Paper_Visual_Representations_Visual_Culture_and_Computer_Graphics_in_Design_Engineering","235674612_Visual_methodologies_An_introduction_to_the_interpretation_of_visual_materials","235674571_Ways_of_Seeing","234021900_Creativity_as_Blind_Variation_and_Selective_Retention_Is_the_Creative_Process_Darwinian","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","222672623_Metrics_for_measuring_ideation_effectiveness","220689756_Semiology_of_Graphics_Diagrams_Networks_Maps","44828585_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Techniques_And_Procedures_For_Developing_Grounded_Theory","35459342_On_line_and_on_paper_visual_representations_visual_culture_and_computer_graphics_in_design_engineering","34132089_On_ice_and_other_stories","31767546_Information_Visualization_Perception_for_Design_C_Ware_prol_de_Stuart_Card","30869725_Lingua_Francas_for_Design_Sacred_Places_and_Pattern_Languages_Pattern_Languages","2456102_Pad_-_An_Alternative_Approach_to_the_Computer_Interface","2242380_A_Pattern_Approach_to_Interaction_Design"]}
