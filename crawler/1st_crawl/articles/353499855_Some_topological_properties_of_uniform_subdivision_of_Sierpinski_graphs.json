{"id":"353499855_Some_topological_properties_of_uniform_subdivision_of_Sierpinski_graphs","abstract":"Sierpiński graphs are family of fractal nature graphs having applications in mathematics of Tower of Hanoi, topology, computer science, and many more diverse areas of science and technology. This family of graphs can be generated by taking certain number of copies of the same basic graph. A topological index is the number which shows some basic properties of the chemical structures. This article deals with degree based topological indices of uniform subdivision of the generalized Sierpiński graphs S(n,G) and Sierpiński gasket Sn. The closed formulae for the computation of different kinds of Zagreb indices, multiple Zagreb indices, reduced Zagreb indices, augmented Zagreb indices, Narumi-Katayama index, forgotten index, and Zagreb polynomials have been presented for the family of graphs.","authors":["Jia-Bao Liu","Hafiz Muhammad Afzal Siddiqui","Faisal Nadeem","Muhammad Ahsan Banyamin"],"meta":["July 2021Main Group Metal Chemistry 44(1):218-227","DOI:10.1515/mgmc-2021-0006"],"references":["344427785_Consensus_Modeling_with_Asymmetric_Cost_Based_on_Data-Driven_Robust_Optimization","309531801_Zagreb_indices_and_multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_subdivision_graphs_of_double_graphs","306233844_Zagreb_Polynomials_of_Three_Graph_Operators","301631709_On_the_first_Zagreb_index_and_multiplicative_Zagreb_coindices_of_graphs","339119816_A_Fuzzy_Robust_Weighted_Approach_for_Multi-Criteria_Bilevel_Games","332010373_Optimal_strategy_for_a_green_supply_chain_considering_shipping_policy_and_default_risk","323451776_On_certain_topological_indices_of_nanostructures_using_QG_and_RG_operators","297708702_The_hyper-Zagreb_index_of_graph_operations","288255248_Some_binary_games","284793935_An_Exceptional_Property_of_First_Zagreb_Index"]}
