{"id":"275054999_The_Maximum_Cut_Problem_in_Co-bipartite_Chain_Graphs","abstract":"A co-bipartite chain graph is a co-bipartite graph in which the neighborhoods of the vertices in each clique can be linearly ordered with respect to inclusion. It is known that the maximum cardinality cut problem ((Formula presented.)) is (Formula presented.) in co-bipartite graphs (Bodlaender and Jansen, Nordic J Comput 7(2000):14–31, 2000). We consider (Formula presented.) in co-bipartite chain graphs. We first consider the twin-free case and present an explicit solution. We then show that (Formula presented.) is polynomial time solvable in this graph class.","authors":["Arman Boyacı","Tinaz Ekim","Mordechai Shalom"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 35(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-015-9963-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287853846_Graphs_of_Edge-Intersecting_and_Non-Splitting_One_Bend_Paths_in_a_Grid","262162554_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_to_Statistical_Physics_and_Circuit_Layout_Design","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220673096_Linear-time_certifying_recognition_algorithms_and_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","244439781_Reducibility_among_Combinatorial_Problems_In_Complexity_of_Computer_Compu-tations","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","222509803_Characterization_of_derived_graphs","222492018_Difference_graphs","220618257_Node-Deletion_Problems_on_Bipartite_Graphs"]}
