{"id":"316321578_An_evaluation_of_a_professional_learning_network_for_computer_science_teachers","abstract":"This paper describes and evaluates aspects of a professional development programme for existing CS teachers in secondary schools (PLAN C) which was designed to support teachers at a time of substantial curricular change. The paper’s particular focus is on the formation of a teacher professional development network across several hundred teachers and a wide geographical area. Evidence from a series of observations and teacher surveys over a two-year period is analysed with respect to the project’s programme theory in order to illustrate not only whether it worked as intended, by why. Results indicate that the PLAN C design has been successful in increasing teachers’ professional confidence and appears to have catalysed powerful change in attitudes to learning. Presentation of challenging pedagogical content knowledge and conceptual frameworks, high-quality teacher-led professional dialogue, along with the space for reflection and classroom trials, triggered examination of the teachers’ own current practices.","authors":["Quintin Cutts","Judy Robertson","Peter Donaldson","Laurie O’Donnell"],"meta":["April 2017Computer Science Education","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2017.1315958","Project: Professional Learning And Networking for Computing (PLAN C)"],"references":["311425641_Expanding_computer_science_education_in_schools_Understanding_teacher_experiences_and_challenges","301463409_Challenges_of_a_Computer_Science_Classroom_Initial_Perspectives_from_Teachers","301429315_The_network_of_teaching_excellence_in_computer_science_and_master_teachers","276891366_The_Influence_of_Teachers'_Knowledge_on_Student_Learning_in_Middle_School_Physical_Science_Classrooms","273915607_The_contribution_of_research_to_teachers'_professional_learning_and_development","259999058_Purposeful_Program_Theory_Effective_Use_of_Theories_of_Change_and_Logic_Models","254934696_Professional_Development_and_Teacher_Change","254462921_Adapting_the_disciplinary_commons_model_for_high_school_teachers_Improving_recruitment_creating_community","347881175_Peer_Instruction_Ten_years_of_experience_and_results","274998933_What_Works_in_Professional_Development"]}
