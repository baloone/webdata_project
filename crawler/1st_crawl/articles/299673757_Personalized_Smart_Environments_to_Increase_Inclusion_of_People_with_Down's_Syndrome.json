{"id":"299673757_Personalized_Smart_Environments_to_Increase_Inclusion_of_People_with_Down's_Syndrome","abstract":"Most people with Downs Syndrome (DS) experience low integration with society. Recent research and new opportunities for their integration in mainstream education and work provided numerous cases where levels of achievement exceeded the (limiting) expectations. This paper describes a project, POSEIDON, aiming at developing a technological infrastructure which can foster a growing number of services developed to support people with DS. People with DS have their own strengths, preferences and needs so POSEIDON will focus on using their strengths to provide support for their needs whilst allowing each individual to personalize the solution based on their preferences. This project is user-centred from its inception and will give all main stakeholders ample opportunities to shape the output of the project, which will ensure a final outcome which is of practical usefulness and interest to the intended users.","authors":["Juan Carlos Augusto Wrede","Terje Grimstad","Reiner Wichert","Eva Schulze"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-03647-2_16","Conference: International Joint Conference on Ambient Intelligence","Projects: Smart EnvironmentsPOSEIDON"],"references":["237407315_Number_and_arithmetic_skills_in_children_with_Down_syndrome","221909807_Exploring_the_Potential_of_Virtual_Reality_for_the_Elderly_and_People_with_Disabilities","232204436_The_Emerging_Down_Syndrome_Behavioral_Phenotype_in_Early_Childhood"]}
