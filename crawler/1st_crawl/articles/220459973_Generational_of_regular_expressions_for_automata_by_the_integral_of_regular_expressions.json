{"id":"220459973_Generational_of_regular_expressions_for_automata_by_the_integral_of_regular_expressions","abstract":"In this paper, the integral of regular expressions is defined and its properties are presentedâ€”The concept of the integral is then applied to establishing an algorithm for generating the regular expression of an arbitrary finite automaton specified by its state diagram or flow table. The regular expression for a given automaton obtained by this algorithm is shown to be unique up to the commutative property of the sum. This algorithm is effective and suitable for machine implementation. Programmed results of this algorithm are also given and interpreted.","authors":["L. W. Smith","S. S.
