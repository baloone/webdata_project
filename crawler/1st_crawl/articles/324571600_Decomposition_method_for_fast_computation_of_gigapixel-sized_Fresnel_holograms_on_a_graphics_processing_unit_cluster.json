{"id":"324571600_Decomposition_method_for_fast_computation_of_gigapixel-sized_Fresnel_holograms_on_a_graphics_processing_unit_cluster","abstract":"A parallel computation method for large-size Fresnel computer-generated hologram (CGH) is reported. The method was introduced by us in an earlier report as a technique for calculating Fourier CGH from 2D object data. In this paper we extend the method to compute Fresnel CGH from 3D object data. The scale of the computation problem is also expanded to 2 gigapixels, making it closer to real application requirements. The significant feature of the reported method is its ability to avoid communication overhead and thereby fully utilize the computing power of parallel devices. The method exhibits three layers of parallelism that favor small to large scale parallel computing machines. Simulation and optical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the workability and to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. A two-times improvement in computation speed has been achieved compared to the conventional method, on a 16-node cluster (one GPU per node) utilizing only one layer of parallelism. A 20-times improvement in computation speed has been estimated utilizing two layers of parallelism on a very large-scale parallel machine with 16 nodes, where each node has 16 GPUs.","authors":["Boaz Jessie Jackin","Shinpei Watanabe","Kanemitsu Ootsu","Takeshi Ohkawa"],"meta":["April 2018Applied Optics 57(12):3134","DOI:10.1364/AO.57.003134","Project: Light Field 3D Displays, Holography"],"references":["304631099_Angular_spectrum_method_with_compact_space-bandwidth_Generalization_and_full-field_accuracy","303537579_Efficient_calculation_method_for_realistic_deep_3D_scene_hologram_using_orthographic_projection","303320521_3D_Quantitative_Evaluation_System_for_Autostereoscopic_Display","283013079_Accurate_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_using_angular-spectrum_layer-oriented_method","280976284_Computer-generated_holograms_by_multiple_wavefront_recording_plane_method_with_occlusion_culling","280122152_Angular_spectrum-based_wave-propagation_method_with_compact_space_bandwidth_for_large_propagation_distances","272101267_Fully_computed_holographic_stereogram_based_algorithm_for_computer-generated_holograms_with_accurate_depth_cues","236527656_Capability_of_the_Human_Visual_System","224141855_State_of_the_Art_in_Holographic_Displays_A_Survey","51919237_Quantitative_space-bandwidth_product_analysis_in_digital_holography","51193391_Calculation_for_computer_generated_hologram_using_ray-sampling_plane","49720018_On_resolution_and_viewing_of_holographic_image_generated_by_3D_holographic_display","40443384_Extremely_high-definition_full-parallax_computer-generated_hologram_created_by_the_polygon-based_method","5497179_Recurrence_Formulas_for_Fast_Creation_of_Synthetic_Three-Dimensional_Holograms","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","321983966_Super_multiview_3D_display_systems","321412423_Development_of_automatic_matching_and_image_quality_improving_methods_for_scattering_3D_display","310612425_360_Degree_Crosstalk-Free_Viewable_3D_Display_Based_on_Multiplexed_Light_Field_Theory_and_Experiments","309082103_Multi-SLM_color_holographic_3D_display_based_on_RGB_spatial_filter","301718839_Fast_generation_of_a_high-quality_computer-generated_hologram_using_a_scalable_and_flexible_PC_cluster","297661536_Fast_processing_method_to_generate_gigabyte_computer_generated_holography_for_three-dimensional_dynamic_holographic_display","286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","284453599_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_hologram_for_RGB_and_depth_images_using_wavefront_recording_plane_method","283465735_A_review_of_dynamic_holographic_3D_display_algorithms_devices_and_systems","282402773_Hardware_architecture_for_full_analytical_Fraunhofer_computer-generated_holograms","280796296_Acceleration_of_computer-generated_hologram_by_Greatly_Reduced_Array_of_Processor_Element_with_Data_Reduction","271489003_Development_of_full-color_full-parallax_digital_3D_holographic_display_system_and_its_prospects","269404271_Distributed_calculation_method_for_largepixel-Number_holograms_by_decomposition_of_object_and_hologram_planes","258807879_Real-time_generation_of_high-definition_resolution_digital_holograms_by_using_multiple_graphic_processing_units","257301289_Fast_distributed_large-pixel-count_hologram_computation_using_a_GPU_cluster","256488003_Fast_computation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_Xeon_Phi_coprocessor","252388880_Recent_developments_in_computer-generated_holography_Toward_a_practical_electroshock_system_for_interactive_3D_visualisation","242310554_Space-bandwidth_product_of_optical_signals_and_systems","238908987_Space-bandwidth_product_of_conventional_Fourier_transforming_systems","232610356_Fast_high-resolution_computer-generated_hologram_computation_using_multiple_graphics_processing_unit_cluster_system","232272119_Computer-generated_Alcove_hologram_to_display_floating_image_with_wide_viewing_angle","232272042_Real-time_color_electroholography_using_multiple_graphics_processing_units_and_multiple_high-definition_liquid-crystal_display_panels","231741962_Scaled_angular_spectrum_method","230916598_Computer-simulated_Fresnel_holography","224217650_Digital_Holographic_Three-Dimensional_Video_Displays","51658614_Angular_spectrum_calculations_for_arbitrary_focal_length_with_a_scaled_convolution","44852813_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated-hologram_on_AMD_HD5000_series_GPU_and_OpenCL","44657576_Computer-generated_holograms_of_3-D_objects_composed_of_tilted_planar_segments","41467019_Stereoscopic_approach_to_3_D_display_using_computer_generated_holograms","26717006_HORN-6_special-purpose_clustered_computing_system_for_electroholography","26297994_Shifted_Fresnel_diffraction_for_computational_holography","26259019_Full-color_computer-generated_holograms_using_3-D_Fourier_spectra","26246398_Color_computer-generated_holograms_from_projection_images"]}
