{"id":"315373088_On_coindices_of_graphs_and_their_complements","abstract":"It was recently discovered (Gutman et al., 2015) that the coindex of the first Zagreb index of any graph is equal to the coindex of the complement of this graph. We examine the possibility that an analogous equality holds for other topological indices. It is shown that there are several classes of graphs and classes of topological indices for which such a relation is obeyed.","authors":["Ivan Gutman"],"meta":["July 2017Applied Mathematics and Computation 305:161-165","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2017.02.009"],"references":["327149772_Vertex-weighted_Wiener_polynomials_for_composite_graphs","303127974_Chemical_Trees_with_Extreme_Values_of_a_Few_Types_of_Multiplicative_Zagreb_Indices","282791723_On_Zagreb_Indices_and_Coindices","282310757_Novel_Zagreb_Indices-Based_Inequalities_with_Particular_Regard_to_Semiregular_and_Generalized_Semiregular_Graphs","280136936_The_Zagreb_Indices_30_Years_After","279188655_On_the_Relations_between_the_Zagreb_Indices_Clique_Numbers_and_Walks_in_Graphs","267081399_A_survey_on_the_Randic_index","265350345_The_first_Zagreb_index_30_years_after","254257318_On_structure-sensitivity_of_degree-based_topological_indices","251551964_On_the_vertex_degree_indices_of_connected_graphs","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons","207411090_Molecular_Descriptors_for_Chemoinformatics"]}
