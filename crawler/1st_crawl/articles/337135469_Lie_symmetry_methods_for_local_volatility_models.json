{"id":"337135469_Lie_symmetry_methods_for_local_volatility_models","abstract":"We investigate PDEs of the form ut=12σ2(t,x)uxx−g(x)u which are associated with the calculation of expectations for a large class of local volatility models. We find nontrivial symmetry groups that can be used to obtain Fourier transforms of fundamental solutions of the PDE. We detail explicit computations in the separable volatility case when σ(t,x)=h(t)(α+βx+γx2), g=0, corresponding to the so called Quadratic Normal Volatility Model. We give financial applications and also show how symmetries can be used to compute first hitting distributions.","authors":["Mark Craddock","Martino Grasselli"],"meta":["November 2019Stochastic Processes and their Applications 130(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.spa.2019.10.009"],"references":["287395445_Pricing_of_Volatility_Derivatives_using_32-Stochastic_Models","265460230_On_the_Transformation_of_Diffusion_Processes_into_the_Wiener_Process","228773733_SYM_A_new_symmetry-finding_package_for_Mathematica","224967892_New_solvable_stochastic_volatility_models_for_pricing_volatilityderivatives","221667340_Why_Are_Quadratic_Normal_Volatility_Models_Analytically_Tractable","24109200_The_calculation_of_expectations_for_classes_of_diffusion_processes_by_Lie_symmetry_methods","282987470_Fourier_type_transforms_on_Lie_symmetry_groups","282072683_New_classes_of_non-convolution_integral_equations_arising_from_Lie_symmetry_analysis_of_hyperbolic_PDEs","278158068_LIE_SYMMETRY_APPROACH_TO_THE_CEV_MODEL","274182092_Tables_of_Integral_Transforms_I","268173748_A_family_of_integral_representations_for_the_solution_of_the_diffusion_equation","267186180_Functionals_of_Multidimensional_Diffusions_with_Applications_to_Finance","248390446_The_One-Dimensional_Heat_Equation","243006200_On_the_equivalence_of_Lie_symmetries_and_group_representations","243005864_Fundamental_solutions_transition_densities_and_the_integration_of_Lie_symmetries","243001181_Generating_integrable_one_dimensional_driftless_diffusions","238855472_Symmetry_group_methods_for_fundamental_solutions","235622463_The_Vol_Smile_Problem","230551924_Stochastic_volatility_models_and_the_pricing_of_vix_options","227623955_Generalized_uncorrelated_SABR_models_with_a_high_degree_of_symmetry","222998875_New_solutions_to_the_bond-pricing_equation_via_Lie's_classical_method","46460360_Lie_Symmetry_Methods_for_Multidimensional_Linear_Parabolic_PDES_and_Diffusions","23697041_Lie_Group_Symmetries_as_Integral_Transforms_of_Fundamental_Solutions","4998354_Extended_LIBOR_Market_Models_with_Affine_and_Quadratic_Volatility"]}
