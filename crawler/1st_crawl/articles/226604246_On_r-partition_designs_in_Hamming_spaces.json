{"id":"226604246_On_r-partition_designs_in_Hamming_spaces","abstract":"The concept of the combinatorial matrix of an unrestricted code and the notion of anr-partition design admitted by a code are introduced and discussed in detail. The theory includes a characterization of completely regular codes, and a combinatorial interpretation of the fact that the distinct rows of the distance distribution matrix of a code are linearly independent. In general, it is possible to compute the distance distribution matrix of any code admitting a given partition design by solving a well-defined system of linear equations; this is an efficient technique provided the number of classes in the partition is relatively small.","authors":["Paul Camion","Bernard Courteau","Philippe Delsarte"],"meta":["January 1992Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 2(3):147-162","DOI:10.1007/BF01294330"],"references":["268973171_Etude_De_Certains_Parametres_Associes_a_Un_Code_Lineaire","265712893_Weight_Distribution_of_Translates_of_Linear_Codes_and_Generalized_Pless_Indentities","265446543_Difference_sets_in_elementary_Abelian_groups","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","265329007_Coherent_configurations_Part_I_Ordinary_Representation_Theory","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","258236794_A_survey_of_perfect_codes","254848251_Binary_uniformly_packed_codes","238883225_A_survey_of_perfect_codes","226999990_Coherent_configurations_-_II_Weights","222924512_Four_fundamental_parameters_of_a_code_and_their_combinatorial_significance","220685101_A_characterization_of_N-weight_projective_codes","220076453_Partial_Difference_Sets_and_Partially_Balanced_Weighing_Designs_for_Calibration_and_Tournaments","34964628_Uniformly_packed_codes","34602508_Codes_dans_les_graphes_reguliers_microforme","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","3083600_A_characterization_of_N-weight_projective_codes_Corresp"]}
