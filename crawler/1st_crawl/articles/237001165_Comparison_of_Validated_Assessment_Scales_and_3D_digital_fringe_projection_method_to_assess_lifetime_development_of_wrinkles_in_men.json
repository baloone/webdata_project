{"id":"237001165_Comparison_of_Validated_Assessment_Scales_and_3D_digital_fringe_projection_method_to_assess_lifetime_development_of_wrinkles_in_men","abstract":"The assessment of wrinkle severity is an important evaluation criterion to determine the efficacy of aesthetic treatments. Aim of the present study was to compare Validated Assessment Scales (VAS) and 3D fringe projection (PRIMOS®) for the evaluation of facial wrinkles in men and to determine standard values for each level of the VAS.\n150 male subjects (20 to 70 years) were selected following strict criteria. Wrinkle severity at periorbital, glabella and forehead lines was evaluated using the 3D fringe projection and 5-point photonumeric VAS. The results of both methods were matched by determining quantitative values for each level of the clinical rating scale.\nHigh average correlation with age was found for VAS, Wd, maxWd, lWd, Wv, aWa and pWa. With a Wd of 60 to 70μm crow's feet and forehead lines are pronounced first, whereas glabella lines develop in subject's mid-forties, by an Wd of 180μm. Wrinkle severity increases at all locations every 10 years of age by one level of the VAS. This increase corresponds to an increase of Wd about 100 μm at glabella and forehead lines, and about 50 μm at crow's feet.\nThe presented reference values for the Validated Assessment Scale are an important step towards an optimized assessment of skin aging and aesthetic dermatological treatments. The data helps to combine the precession of a biophysical measurement with the practical relevance of a clinical rating.","authors":["Stefanie Luebberding","Nils Krueger","Martina Kerscher"],"meta":["May 2013Skin Research and Technology 20(1)","DOI:10.1111/srt.12079","SourcePubMed"],"references":["46179758_A_validated_facial_grading_scale_The_future_of_facial_ageing_measurement_tools","14570403_Pulsed_Carbon_dioxide_laser_resurfacing_of_photo-aged_facial_skin","320756080_Fringe_Projection_for_In_Vivo_Topometry","277495907_Pulsed_Carbon_Dioxide_Laser_Resurfacing_of_Photoaged_Facial_Skin","258851565_Quantification_of_Age-Related_Facial_Wrinkles_in_Men_and_Women_Using_a_Three-Dimensional_Fringe_Projection_Method_and_Validated_Assessment_Scales","233330139_Fractional_Nonablative_Q-switched_1064-nm_Neodymium_YAG_Laser_to_Rejuvenate_Photoaged_Skin_A_Pilot_Case_Series","230066698_EEMCO_Guidance_for_the_assessment_of_skin_topography","227700411_3D_In-Vivo_Optical_Skin_Imaging_for_Topographical_Quantitative_Assessment_of_Non-Ablative_Laser_Technology","221816260_Validated_Assessment_Scales_for_the_Upper_Face","51446961_Noninferiority_of_IncobotulinumtoxinA_Free_from_Complexing_Proteins_Compared_with_Another_Botulinum_Toxin_Type_A_in_the_Treatment_of_Glabellar_Frown_Lines","51434911_A_Validated_Grading_Scale_for_Crow's_Feet","51434908_A_Validated_Grading_Scale_for_Forehead_Lines","51223335_Update_on_treatment_rationale_and_options_for_the_ageing_face","26794517_Efficacy_of_anti-aging_products_for_periorbital_wrinkles_as_measured_by_3-D_imaging","19777850_The_Validity_and_Practicality_of_Sun-Reactive_Skin_Types_I_Through_VI","13881645_Physiologic_and_structural_changes_associated_with_aging_skin","12954808_EEMCO_guidance_for_the_assessment_of_skin_topography_The_European_Expert_Group_on_Efficacy_Measurement_of_Cosmetics_and_other_Topical_Products","11466572_3D_In-Vivo_Optical_Skin_Imaging_for_Topographical_Quantitative_Assessment_of_Non-Ablative_Laser_Technology","11093191_Age_related_changes_in_skin_wrinkles_assessed_by_a_three_dimensional_morphometric_analysis","5429955_The_spectrum_of_laser_skin_resurfacing_Nonablative_fractional_and_ablative_laser_resurfacing"]}
