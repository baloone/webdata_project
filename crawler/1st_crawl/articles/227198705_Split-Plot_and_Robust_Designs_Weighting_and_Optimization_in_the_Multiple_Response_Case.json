{"id":"227198705_Split-Plot_and_Robust_Designs_Weighting_and_Optimization_in_the_Multiple_Response_Case","abstract":"This paper deals with experimental planning and optimization in response surface methodology. It aims at addressing two main\nissues: i) the optimization of a split-plot design in the multiple response case by the use of a robust-design approach and\nii) the related problem of weighting the responses according to the actual importance of these variables and the target values\nwhen performing simultaneous optimization. An application to the study of a Numerical Control machine in order to improve\nthe accuracy of the measurement process and to reduce the measurement time is presented.","authors":["Rossella Berni"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-7908-2410-0_4","In book: mODa 9 â€“ Advances in Model-Oriented Design and Analysis (pp.25-32)"],"references":["286028517_Two_Approaches_for_Improving_the_Dual_Response_Method_in_Robust_Parameter_Design","323232665_Response_Surface_Designs_within_a_Split-Plot_Structure","314310150_Experimental_Designs","257759161_Response_Surface_Methodology_and_multiple_response_case_optimization_measures_developments_and_comparisons","247531267_Simultaneous_Optimization_of_Several_Response_Variable","247403329_Response_Surface_Designs_Within_a_Split-Plot_Structure","243769661_Split-plot_designs_for_robust_experimentation","232128425_Experimental_Designs","230265638_Process_Optimization_via_Robust_Parameter_Design_when_Categorical_Noise_Factors_are_Present","229566504_Planning_and_Optimization_of_a_Numerical_Control_Machine_in_a_Multiple_Response_Case"]}
