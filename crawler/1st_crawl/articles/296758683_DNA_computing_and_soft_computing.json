{"id":"296758683_DNA_computing_and_soft_computing","abstract":"Recently, DNA computing arouses wide interests of many researchers, particularly, the integration of DNA computing and soft computing. In this paper, we first introduce the relative biological background and main biological tools of DNA computing. Then, we provide some DNA computing models and algorithms. After that, we explore the ideas and methods for integrating DNA computing with evolutionary computation, fuzzy control, neural networks and artificial immune systems in soft computing technologies.","authors":["Y.-S.
