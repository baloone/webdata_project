{"id":"301377096_IT_Capstone_Course_Structure_for_Success","abstract":"Team-based capstone projects are a well-supported aspect of IT programs. These are an excellent opportunity for students to demonstrate the learned skills and to acquire teamwork and project management skills. Real-world capstone projects provided by external sponsors provide authentic and rich learning experiences but also significant challenges. Students respond well to the challenge of working with real clients on meaningful applications. Over 10 years the Brigham Young University IT capstone program has learned some lessons and realized some questions for further research. We define, describe and address key questions in capstone course structure and share experiences that illustrate their validity and relevance. Some guidelines for capstone courses with real-world projects are provided.","authors":["Richard G. Helps","Joseph J. Ekstrom","Barry M.
