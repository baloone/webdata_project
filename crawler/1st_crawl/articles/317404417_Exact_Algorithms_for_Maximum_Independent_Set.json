{"id":"317404417_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","abstract":"We show that the maximum independent set problem on an n-vertex graph can be solved in time and polynomial space, which even is faster than Robson's -time exponential-space algorithm published in 1986. We also obtain improved algorithms for MIS in graphs with maximum degree 6 and 7, which run in time of and , respectively. Our algorithms are obtained by using fast algorithms for MIS in low-degree graphs in a hierarchical way and making a careful analysis on the structure of bounded-degree graphs.","authors":["Mingyu Xiao","Hiroshi Nagamochi"],"meta":["June 2017Information and Computation 255(1â€“2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2017.06.001","Project: Exact Algorithms"],"references":["313740595_A_refined_algorithm_for_maximum_independent_set_in_degree-4_graphs","259440783_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","228535845_Fast_algorithms_for_max_independent_set","221583390_A_Fine-grained_Analysis_of_a_Simple_Independent_Set_Algorithm","221013484_A_Simple_and_Fast_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_3-Degree_Graphs","220430761_A_Measure_Conquer_Approach_for_the_Analysis_of_Exact_Algorithms","50950910_Fast_Algorithms_for_max_independent_set","279540844_O20_3_0_4_N_ALGORITHM_FOR_SOLVING_MAXIMUM_INDEPENDENT_SET_PROBLEM","273750472_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Degree-5_Graphs","228517092_Confining_Sets_and_Avoiding_Bottleneck_Cases_A_Simple_Maximum_Independent_Set_Algorithm_in_Degree-3_Graphs","222673286_Vertex_Cover_Further_Observations_and_Further_Improvements","222614617_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Sets","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","221369179_Exact_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_A_Survey","220980214_A_Faster_Algorithm_for_Finding_Maximum_Independent_Sets_in_Sparse_Graphs","220780376_Finding_Maximum_Independent_Sets_in_Sparse_and_General_Graphs","220657889_Faster_computation_of_maximum_independent_set_and_parameterized_vertex_cover_for_graphs_with_maximum_degree_3","220618427_Finding_a_Maximum_Independent_Set","220430847_An_Optimal_Algorithm_to_Detect_a_Line_Graph_and_Output_Its_Root_Graph","220390536_Quasiconvex_Analysis_of_Multivariate_Recurrence_Equations_for_Backtracking_Algorithms","47842533_A_Tighter_Bound_for_Counting_Max-Weight_Solutions_to_2SAT_Instances","3048810_An_O20304n_Algorithm_for_Solving_Maximum_Independent_Set_Problem"]}
