{"id":"305731673_Exploring_the_effects_of_seductive_details_with_the_4-phase_model_of_interest","abstract":"Although numerous studies have investigated the seductive details effect in multimedia learning and remarked that seductive details can arouse motivation and interest, few studies have examined the seductive details effect using a motivational framework. In order to fill the gap, the present study used a multiple regression model to examine the predictive relationship between four types of interest and post-task performance of participants who received either a passage containing seductive details or a base-only passage. Participants in both groups (N = 258) were asked to learn a passage about geology. An interest questionnaire was validated by using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results of variance analyses showed that the seductive details group rated the learning material significantly higher in triggered situational interest than did the base passage group. Furthermore, the results showed that triggered situational interest mediated the effects of seductive details on recall while there was no mediation effect via maintained situational interest. In addition, emerging and well-developed individual interest moderated the effects of seductive details. In sum, the results indicated that different types of interest play different roles in learning when seductive details are involved. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed and future directions are suggested.","authors":["Zhe Wang","Olusola O.
