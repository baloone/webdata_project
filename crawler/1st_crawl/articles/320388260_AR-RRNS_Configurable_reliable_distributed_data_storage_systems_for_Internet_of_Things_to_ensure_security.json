{"id":"320388260_AR-RRNS_Configurable_reliable_distributed_data_storage_systems_for_Internet_of_Things_to_ensure_security","abstract":"Benefits of Internet of Things and cloud-fog-edge computing are associated with the risks of confidentiality, integrity, and availability related with the loss of information, denial of access for a long time, information leakage, conspiracy and technical failures. In this article, we propose a configurable, reliable, and confidential distributed data storage scheme with the ability to process encrypted data and control results of computations. Our system utilizes Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) with new method of error correction codes and secret sharing schemes. We introduce the concept of an approximate value of a rank of a number (AR), which allows us to reduce the computational complexity of the decoding from RNS to binary representation, and size of the coefficients. Based on the properties of the approximate value and arithmetic properties of RNS, we introduce AR-RRNS method for error detection, correction, and controlling computational results. We provide a theoretical basis to configure probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding and decoding to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and storage properties. Theoretical analysis shows that by appropriate selection of RRNS parameters, the proposed scheme allows not only increasing safety, reliability, and reducing an overhead of data storage, but also processing of encrypted data.","authors":["Nikolay Chervyakov","Mikhail Babenko","Andrei Tchernykh","Nikolay Kucherov"],"meta":["October 2017Future Generation Computer Systems
