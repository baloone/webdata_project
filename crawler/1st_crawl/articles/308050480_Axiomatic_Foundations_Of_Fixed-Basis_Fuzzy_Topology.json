{"id":"308050480_Axiomatic_Foundations_Of_Fixed-Basis_Fuzzy_Topology","abstract":"This paper gives the first comprehensive account on various systems of axioms of fixed-basis, L-fuzzy topological spaces and their corresponding convergence theory. In general we do not pursue the historical development, but it is our primary aim to present the state of the art of this field. We focus on the following problems:","authors":["U.
