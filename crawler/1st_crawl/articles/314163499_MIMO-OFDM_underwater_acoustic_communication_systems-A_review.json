{"id":"314163499_MIMO-OFDM_underwater_acoustic_communication_systems-A_review","abstract":"The ever increasing demand for bandwidth, efficiency, spatial diversity and performance of underwater acoustic (UWA) communication has opened doors for the use of Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO). A combination of MIMO and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has proved to be a promising solution for many scenarios in UWA communication; on the contrary, it also amplifies the design challenges for implementing such schemes to acquire the required bandwidth efficiency. The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive survey of the latest researches in the field of UWA MIMO-OFDM communication. The previous works are summarized, reviewed and compared according to their years of publication while problems faced by UWA MIMO-OFDM communication are highlighted. The articles are classified according to the focused techniques like channel estimation, equalization, coding and detection. Furthermore the works are compared based on the complexity and performance of the algorithms while some future research issues are identified.","authors":["Gang Qiao","Zeeshan Babar","Lu Ma","Songzuo
