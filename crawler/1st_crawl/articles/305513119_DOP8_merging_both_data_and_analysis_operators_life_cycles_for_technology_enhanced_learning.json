{"id":"305513119_DOP8_merging_both_data_and_analysis_operators_life_cycles_for_technology_enhanced_learning","abstract":"This paper presents DOP8: a Data Mining Iterative Cycle that improves the classical data life cycle. While the latter only combines the data production and data analysis phases, DOP8 also integrates the analysis operators life cycle. In this cycle, data life cycle and operators life cycle processing meet in the data analysis step. This paper also presents a reification of DOP8 in a new computing platform: UnderTracks. The latter provides a flexibility on storing and sharing data, operators and analysis processes. Undertracks is compared with three types of platform 'Storage platform', 'Analysis platform' and 'Storage and Analysis platform'. Several real TEL analysis scenarios are present into the platform, (1) to test Undertracks flexibility on storing data and operators and (2) to test Undertracks flexibility on designing analysis processes.","authors":["Nadine Mandran","Michael Ortega","Vanda Luengo","Denis Bouhineau"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1145/2723576.2723580","Conference: the Fifth International Conference","Project: Hubble Learn"],"references":["285018297_Orange_Data_Mining_Toolbox_in_Python","277195076_A_Survey_on_Pre-Processing_Educational_Data","261849069_Multimodal_learning_and_teaching_corpora_exchange_Lessons_learned_in_five_years_by_the_Mulce_project","254462827_Learning_analytics_and_educational_data_mining_Towards_communication_and_collaboration","254199600_A_Data_Repository_for_the_EDM_Community","228455967_UK_Data_Archive_Resources_for_Studying_Older_People_and_Ageing","222815211_Educational_data_mining_A_survey_from_1995_to_2005","221517099_Off-Task_Behavior_in_the_Cognitive_Tutor_Classroom_When_Students_Game_The_System","221297301_Human-Machine_Student_Model_Discovery_and_Improvement_Using_DataShop","221297241_Managing_the_Educational_Dataset_Lifecycle_with_DataShop"]}
