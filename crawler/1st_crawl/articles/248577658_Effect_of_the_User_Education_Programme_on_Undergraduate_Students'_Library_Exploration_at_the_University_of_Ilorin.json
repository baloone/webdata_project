{"id":"248577658_Effect_of_the_User_Education_Programme_on_Undergraduate_Students'_Library_Exploration_at_the_University_of_Ilorin","abstract":"The essence of education, formal or informal, is the ability of the learner to put what he has learnt into practical use. Hence, the knowledge acquired must be reflected in the life of the learner. User education programmes are planned in tertiary institutions to ease the work of librarians and quicken the efforts of clientele in getting and utilizing the library materials. This work, therefore, investigates the use of the programme in the university studied. The investigation also sought to reveal the extent to which the objectives of the user were currently being met. It was discovered that much has not been achieved, as lots of improvements are necessary in the areas investigated. Suggestions for its improvement are given.","authors":["J.S.
