{"id":"273181849_AppATP_An_Energy_Conserving_Adaptive_Mobile-Cloud_Transmission_Protocol","abstract":"Many mobile applications require frequent wireless transmissions between the content provider and mobile devices, consuming much energy in mobile devices. Motivated by the popularity of prefetch-friendly or delay-tolerant apps (e.g., social networking, app updates, cloud storage), we design and implement an application-layer transmission protocol, AppATP, which leverages cloud computing to manage data transmissions for mobile apps, transferring data to and from mobile devices in an energy-efficient manner. Measurements show that significantly amount of energy is consumed by mobile devices during poor connectivity. Based on this observation, AppATP adaptively seizes periods of good bandwidth condition to prefetch frequently used data with minimum energy consumption, while deferring delay-tolerant data during poor network connectivity. Using the stochastic control framework, AppATP only relies on the current network information and data queue sizes to make an online decision on transmission scheduling, and performs well under unpredictable wireless network conditions. We implement AppATP on Samsung Note 2 smartphones and Amazon EC2. Results from both trace-driven simulations and extensive real-world experiments show that AppATP can be applied to a variety of application scenarios while achieving - percent energy savings for mobile devices.","authors":["Fangming Liu","Peng Shu","John C.s.
