{"id":"320220792_Selection_history_How_reward_modulates_selectivity_of_visual_attention","abstract":"Visual attention enables us to selectively prioritize or suppress information in the environment. Prominent models concerned with the control of visual attention differentiate between goal-directed, top-down and stimulus-driven, bottom-up control, with the former determined by current selection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. In the current review, we discuss recent studies that demonstrate that attentional selection does not need to be the result of top-down or bottom-up processing but, instead, is often driven by lingering biases due to the \"history\" of former attention deployments. This review mainly focuses on reward-based history effects; yet other types of history effects such as (intertrial) priming, statistical learning and affective conditioning are also discussed. We argue that evidence from behavioral, eye-movement and neuroimaging studies supports the idea that selection history modulates the topographical landscape of spatial \"priority\" maps, such that attention is biased toward locations having the highest activation on this map.","authors":["Michel Failing","Jan Theeuwes"],"meta":["October 2017Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 25(3)","DOI:10.3758/s13423-017-1380-y"],"references":["321195631_Stimulus-driven_and_goal-driven_effects_on_Pavlovian_associative_reward_learning","319541419_Factor_structure_of_the_Barratt_impulsiveness_scale","318613164_Don't_let_it_distract_you_how_information_about_the_availability_of_reward_affects_attentional_selection","317386862_Miss_it_and_miss_out_Counterproductive_nonspatial_attentional_capture_by_task-irrelevant_value-related_stimuli","316982334_On_the_feature_specificity_of_value-driven_attention","313727338_Components_of_visual_orienting","325672180_Programming_of_Endogenous_and_Exogenous_Saccades_Evidence_for_a_Competitive_Integration_Model","325670924_Fears_phobias_and_preparedness_Toward_an_evolved_module_of_fear_and_fear_learning","317260646_Linking_Dopaminergic_Reward_Signals_to_the_Development_of_Attentional_Bias_A_Positron_Emission_Tomographic_Study","313801404_On_the_distinction_between_value-driven_attention_and_selection_history_Evidence_from_individuals_with_depressive_symptoms"]}
