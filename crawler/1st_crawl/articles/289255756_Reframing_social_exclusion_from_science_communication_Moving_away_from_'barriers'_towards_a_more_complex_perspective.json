{"id":"289255756_Reframing_social_exclusion_from_science_communication_Moving_away_from_'barriers'_towards_a_more_complex_perspective","abstract":"Science communication is an increasingly important field of activity, research and policy. It should not be assumed however, that science communication practices provide equitable and empowering opportunities for everyone. Social exclusion, inclusion and equity are key challenges for practitioners, researchers, policy makers and funders involved with science communication. In this commentary I reflect on the limitations of the 'barriers approach to understanding social inclusion and exclusion from science communication and argue instead that a more complex perspective is needed. I conclude that placing equity at the heart of science communication is crucial for developing more inclusive science communication practices.","authors":["Emily Dawson"],"meta":["May 2014Journal of Science Communication 13(2)","DOI:10.22323/2.13020302"],"references":["246084974_Equity_Implications_Based_on_the_Conceptions_of_Science_Achievement_in_Major_Reform_Documents","241728741_Students'_interest_in_biology_and_their_out-of-school_experiences","239553793_Investigating_public_science_interest_and_understanding_Evidence_for_the_importance_of_free-choice_learning","231582177_Learning_Science_in_Informal_Environments_People_Places_and_Pursuits","228346754_Whose_Culture_Has_Capital_A_Critical_Race_Theory_Discussion_of_Community_Cultural_Wealth","27225480_The_Issues_Deserve_More_Credit_Pragmatist_Contributions_to_the_Study_of_Public_Involvement_in_Controversy","316824240_The_Inclusive_Society","316135925_Surrounded_by_science_Learning_science_in_informal_environments","265092259_The_Four-Phase_Model_of_Interest_Development","261948044_Introduction","240522118_Let's_hear_it_for_Humpty_social_exclusion_the_Third_Way_and_cultural_capital","234579194_Diversity_and_Equity_in_Science_Education_Research_Policy_and_Practice_Multicultural_Education_Series"]}
