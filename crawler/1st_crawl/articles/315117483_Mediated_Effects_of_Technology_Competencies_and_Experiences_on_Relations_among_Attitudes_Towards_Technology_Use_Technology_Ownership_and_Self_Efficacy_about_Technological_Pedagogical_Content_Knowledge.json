The present study also investigated interrelations among preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology use, technology ownership, technology competencies, and experiences. The participants of study were 665 elementary preservice science teachers (467 females, 198 males) from 7 colleges in Turkey. The proposed model based on educational technology literature was tested using structural equation modeling. The model testing results revealed that preservice teachers’ technology competencies and experiences mediated the relation of technology ownership to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs. The direct relation of their possession of technology to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs was insignificant while the indirect relation through their technology competencies and experiences was significant. The results also indicated there were significant direct effects of preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology use, technology competencies, and experiences on their TPACK self efficacy beliefs.","authors":["Sevda Yerdelen-Damar","Yezdan Boz","Sevgi Aydin-Günbatar"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Science Education and Technology 26(4):1-12394-405","DOI:10.1007/s10956-017-9687-z"],"references":["308942972_Transforming_Traditional_Practices_Of_Teacher_Preparation_To_Meet_Changing_Needs_Of_Digital_Learners_A_First_Step_Intervention_By_Assessing_And_Addressing_Needs_Of_Pre-Service_Teachers_In_A_Dual_Learn","303849683_Exploring_relationships_among_TPACK_constructs_and_ICT_achievement_among_trainee_teachers","299594534_Putting_technological_pedagogical_and_content_knowledge_TPACK_in_action_An_integrated_TPACK-design-based_learning_DBL_approach","296923209_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Self-Efficacy_Scale_TPACK-SeS_for_Pre-Service_Science_Teachers_Construction_Validation_and_Reliability","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","314398824_A_Survey_of_Secondary_School_Teachers'_Perceptions_Competency_and_Use_of_Computers","309032267_Cutoff_criteria_for_fit_indexes_in_covariance_structure_analysis_Conventional_criteria_versus_new_alternatives","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","299360377_The_Influence_of_TPACK_Contextual_Factors_on_Early_Childhood_Educators'_Tablet_Computer_Use","295812472_Using_Theoretical_Perspectives_in_Developing_Understanding_of_TPACK","290044779_A_Review_of_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","271992315_Increasing_Preservice_Teachers'_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_for_Technology_Integration","285245511_Categories_of_Computer_Use_and_Their_Relationships_with_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","269694446_Exploring_teachers'_use_of_TPACK_in_design_talk_The_collaborative_design_of_technology-rich_early_literacy_activities"]}
