{"id":"227450964_Topicmodels_An_R_Package_for_Fitting_Topic_Models","abstract":"Topic models allow the probabilistic modeling of term frequency occurrences in documents. The fitted model can be used to estimate the similarity between documents as well as between a set of specified keywords using an additional layer of latent variables which are referred to as topics. The R package topicmodels provides basic infrastructure for fitting topic models based on data structures from the text mining package tm. The package includes interfaces to two algorithms for fitting topic models: the variational expectation-maximization algorithm provided by David M. Blei and co-authors and an algorithm using Gibbs sampling by Xuan-Hieu Phan and co-authors.","authors":["Kurt Hornik","Bettina Gr√ºn"],"meta":["May 2011Journal of Statistical Software 40(i13)","DOI:10.18637/jss.v040.i13","SourceRePEc"],"references":["221997021_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","221618332_Online_Learning_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","221023426_Learning_to_Classify_Short_and_Sparse_Text_Web_with_Hidden_Topics_from_Large-Scale_Data_Collections","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","226507886_Text_Classification_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Documents_using_EM","226367232_WinBUGS_-_A_Bayesian_modeling_framework_Concepts_structure_and_extensibility","221345245_Dynamic_Topic_Models","221344683_Evaluation_methods_for_topic_models","221038091_The_first_text_retrieval_conference_TREC-1","220699139_A_Generic_Approach_to_Topic_Models"]}
