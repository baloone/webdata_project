{"id":"230585377_EuroWordNet_A_Multilingual_Database_of_Autonomous_and_Language-specific_Wordnets_Connected_via_an_Inter-Lingual-Index","abstract":"This paper describes the multilingual design of the EuroWordNet database. The EuroWordNet\ndatabase stores wordnets as autonomous language -specific structures that are interconnected via an\nInter-Lingual-Index (ILI). In this paper, we discuss the possibilities to create mappings from each\nwordnet to the central ILI and how the ILI itself can be adapted to provide more overlap across the\nwordnets. We will argue that the ILI can be condensed to a more universal index of meaning, while\nthe wordnets can still encode any fine-grained lexicalizations for each language.","authors":["Piek Vossen"],"meta":["June 2004International Journal of Lexicography 17(2)","DOI:10.1093/ijl/17.2.161","SourceOAI"],"references":["220714644_Lexical_Operations_in_a_Unification-Based_Framework","285135236_Science_and_linguistics","254766453_The_Reduction_of_Semantic_Ambiguity_in_Linguistic_Resources","242608481_EuroWordNet_a_multilingual_database_with_lexical_semantic_networks","237284736_New_developments_in_knowledge-based_machine_translation","230854795_WordNet_-_An_Electronical_Lexical_Database","229100828_Lexical_Semantics","228732092_Mapping_WordNet_to_the_SUMO_ontology","228718083_Integrating_subject_field_codes_into_WordNet","228580120_Shake-and-Bake_Translation"]}
