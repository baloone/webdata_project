{"id":"266965034_Maximal_Branching_Processes_and_'Long-Range_Percolation'","abstract":"In the first part of this paper, we will consider a class of Markov chains on the non-negative integers which resemble the Galton-Watson branching process, but with one major difference. If there are k individuals in the n th “generation”, and are independent random variables representing their respective numbers of offspring, then the ( n + 1)th generation will contain max individuals rather than as in the branching case. Equivalently, the transition matrices P ij of the chains we will study are to be of the form where F (.) is the probability distribution function of a non-negative, integervalued random variable. The right-hand side of (1) is thus the probability that the maximum of i independent random variables distributed by F has the value j . Such a chain will be called a “maximal branching process”.","authors":["John Lamperti"],"meta":["April 1970Journal of Applied Probability 7(1)","DOI:10.2307/3212151"],"references":["226777770_Stochastically_monotone_Markov_Chains"]}
