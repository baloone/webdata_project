{"id":"292289029_Vingt_mille_lieues_sous_les_mers_Addressing_four_challenges_of_informal_learning","abstract":"This paper examines four challenges (conceptual, methodological, recognition and pedagogical) that arose from undertaking research on informal citizenship learning in different contexts. The first challenge is to better understand the different expressions and internal features of informal learning. The second challenge relates to the need to develop creative research strategies to overcome the difficulties in eliciting informal learning. The third challenge concerns the need to improve institutional mechanisms to assess and recognize informal learning. The fourth challenge refers to the need to purposefully design meaningful opportunities for relevant informal learning. The author suggests some possible ways to overcome these challenges.","authors":["Daniel Schugurensky"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.24936/2177-4986.v2n1.2009.107","Project: Citizenship education"],"references":["248983050_A_framework_to_explore_lifelong_learning_The_case_of_the_civic_education_of_civics_teachers","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","276935405_Le_praticien_reflexif_a_la_recherche_du_savoir_cache_dans_l'agir_professionnel","274345048_La_crise_mondiale_de_l'education_Analyse_de_systemes","272939292_The_'accidental_learning'_of_volunteers_The_case_of_community-based_organizations_in_Ontario","265092368_Learning_As_Transformation_Critical_Perspectives_on_A_Theory_in_Progress","242347140_Worker_control_as_the_missing_link_Relations_between_paidunpaid_work_and_work-related_learning","240629491_STATE_OF_THE_FIELD_REVIEW_PRIOR_LEARNING_ASSESSMENT_AND_RECOGNITION_PLAR","235251369_Hidden_Dimensions_of_Work_and_Learning_The_Significance_of_Unpaid_Work_and_Informal_Learning_in_Global_Capitalism","44465308_Une_societe_sans_ecole_Ivan_D_Illich"]}
