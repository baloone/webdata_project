{"id":"344822835_Towards_a_Smarter_Data_dissemination_strategy_in_connected_environments","abstract":"Since the last decade, the emergence of affordable smart devices in web-connected environments (e.g., smart cities and buildings) has been a critical step towards improving user comfort. In this respect, notifying end-users about different essential events in their environment is of significant interest. Thus, the design of an efficient data dissemination strategy is of paramount importance. The thriving challenge would be to inform interested devices about an event and to avoid as far as possible the network collision problem. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new generic and adaptive data Dissemination Strategy in Connected Environments (DSCE). Our strategyâ€™s main thrust is reaching a high delivery ratio as well as a low network overhead by sending messages only to the interested devices. To do so, we rely on a semantic-based approach to define device interests and to identify salient messages. Moreover, to cope with the broadcast storm problem and to organize the scheduling of data dissemination, we provide a new waiting time measure for each device before rebroadcasting any received message. The performed experiments show that our strategy outperforms its competitors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","authors":["Sabri Allani","Richard Chbeir","Khouloud Salameh","Taoufik Yeferny"],"meta":["October 2020Procedia Computer Science 176:1043-1052","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.100","Project: OpenCEMS: Connected Environment & Distributed Energy Data Management Solutions"],"references":["339876869_Towards_a_smarter_directional_data_aggregation_in_VANETs","337529631_Towards_Better_Data_ManagementGathering_in_Connected_Environments","329817344_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Review_of_Enabled_Technologies_and_Future_Challenges","327000690_Smart_Directional_Data_Aggregation_in_VANETs","325725324_Smarter_and_more_connected_Future_intelligent_transportation_system","321828834_A_Scalable_Data_Dissemination_Protocol_Based_on_Vehicles_Trajectories_Analysis","329391503_Energy_Preservation_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks_Using_a_Modified_Butterfly_Optimization_with_Associative_Cluster_Head_Load_Distribution","325689923_MPC_A_RSUs_deployment_strategy_for_VANET","321999542_Broadcasting_methods_in_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","312545701_Efficient_Data_Gathering_and_Estimation_for_Metropolitan_Air_Quality_Monitoring_by_Using_Vehicular_Sensor_Networks","3436240_Broadcast_storm_mitigation_techniques_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","257675898_A_Framework_For_Handling_Local_Broadcast_Storm_Using_Probabilistic_Data_Aggregation_In_VANET","222475348_Olson_C_Parallel_algorithms_for_hierarchical_clustering_Parallel_Computing_218_1313-1325"]}
