{"id":"303847203_Enabling_Interference-Aware_and_Energy-Efficient_Coexistence_of_Multiple_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_With_Unknown_Dynamics","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive interference mitigation scheme for multiple coexisting wireless body area networks (WBANs) based on social interaction. The proposed scheme considers the mobility of nodes within each WBAN as well as the relative movement of WBANs with respect to each other. With respect to these mobile scenarios traffic load, signal strength, and the density of sensors in a WBAN are incorporated to optimize transmission time with synchronous and parallel transmissions to significantly reduce the radio interference and energy consumption of nodes. This approach leads to higher packet delivery ratio (PDR) and longer network lifetime even with nodes dynamically moving into and out of each others interference region. We make channel assignment more energy-efficient and further reduce power consumption using transmit power control with simple channel prediction. Simulation results show that our approach maintains optimum spatial reuse with a range of channel dynamics within, and between, coexisting BANs. This protocol based on social interaction is shown to mitigate interference and minimize power consumption, and increase the spatial reuse and PDR of each WBAN, while increasing network lifetime. In the context of the adaptive interference mitigation scheme proposed, this paper also reviews the state of the art in literature on mobility, MAC layer, and power control solutions for WBANs, as well as providing a summary of interference mitigation schemes previously applied for the coexistence of WBANs.","authors":["Samaneh Movassaghi","Akbar Majidi","Abbas Jamalipour","David
