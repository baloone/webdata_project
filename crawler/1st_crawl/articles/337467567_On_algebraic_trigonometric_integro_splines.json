{"id":"337467567_On_algebraic_trigonometric_integro_splines","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new kind of quadratic approximation operator reproducing of both algebraic and trigonometric functions. It is called integro quadratic splines interpolant, which agree with the given integral values of a univariate real‐valued function over the same intervals, rather than the functional values at the knots. Efficient approximations of fractional integrals and fractional Caputo derivatives based on this interpolant, are constructed and well studied. The general approximation error is studied too, and the super convergence property is also derived when the interval is equally partitioned. Numerical examples illustrate that our method is very effective and our quadratic algebraic trigonometric integro spline has higher approximation ability than others.","authors":["Eddargani Salah","Abdellah Lamnii","Mohamed Lamnii"],"meta":["November 2019ZAMM Journal of applied mathematics and mechanics: Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 100(2)","DOI:10.1002/zamm.201900262","Projects: Interpolation and Approximationspline function"],"references":["322289505_Approximations_of_Fractional_Integrals_and_Caputo_Derivatives_with_Application_in_Solving_Abel's_Integral_Equations","313592933_High-Order_Approximation_to_Caputo_Derivatives_and_Caputo-type_Advection-Diffusion_Equations_Revisited","311956722_Extended_Algorithms_for_Approximating_Variable_Order_Fractional_Derivatives_with_Applications","296862113_High-order_approximation_to_Caputo_derivatives_and_Caputo-type_advection-diffusion_equations_III","275528698_Integro_quadratic_spline_interpolation","266940255_A_Theoretical_Basis_for_the_Application_of_Fractional_Calculus_to_Viscoelasticity","327171021_Algebraic_hyperbolic_spline_quasi-interpolants_and_applications","308631836_A_Practical_Guide_to_Splines","281319894_On_local_integro_quartic_splines","271141264_A_simple_method_for_constructing_integro_spline_quasi-interpolants"]}
