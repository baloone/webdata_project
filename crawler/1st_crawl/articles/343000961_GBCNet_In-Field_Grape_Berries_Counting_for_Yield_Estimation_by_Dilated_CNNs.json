{"id":"343000961_GBCNet_In-Field_Grape_Berries_Counting_for_Yield_Estimation_by_Dilated_CNNs","abstract":"We introduce here the Grape Berries Counting Net (GBCNet), a tool for accurate fruit yield estimation from smartphone cameras, by adapting Deep Learning algorithms originally developed for crowd counting. We test GBCNet using cross-validation procedure on two original datasets CR1 and CR2 of grape pictures taken in-field before veraison. A total of 35,668 berries have been manually annotated for the task. GBCNet achieves good performances on both the seven grape varieties dataset CR1, although with a different accuracy level depending on the variety, and on the single variety dataset CR2: in particular Mean Average Error (MAE) ranges from 0.85% for Pinot Gris to 11.73% for Marzemino on CR1 and reaches 7.24% on the Teroldego CR2 dataset.","authors":["Luca Coviello","Marco Cristoforetti","Giuseppe Jurman","Cesare Furlanello"],"meta":["July 2020Applied Sciences 10(14):4870","DOI:10.3390/app10144870"],"references":["342301455_3DBunch_A_Novel_iOS-Smartphone_Application_to_Evaluate_the_Number_of_Grape_Berries_per_Bunch_Using_Image_Analysis_Techniques","338959386_In-Field_Grape_Cluster_Size_Assessment_for_Vine_Yield_Estimation_Using_a_Mobile_Robot_and_a_Consumer_Level_RGB-D_Camera","337095005_Deep_Learning_Techniques_for_Grape_Plant_Species_Identification_in_Natural_Images","335365966_Investigating_2-D_and_3-D_Proximal_Remote_Sensing_Techniques_for_Vineyard_Yield_Estimation","341662189_Grape_detection_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","340828426_Counting_of_grapevine_berries_in_images_via_semantic_segmentation_using_convolutional_neural_networks","340715741_A_vision-based_robust_grape_berry_counting_algorithm_for_fast_calibration-free_bunch_weight_estimation_in_the_field","340554532_ROLS_Robust_Object-Level_SLAM_for_Grape_Counting","339145685_Grape_detection_segmentation_and_tracking_using_deep_neural_networks_and_three-dimensional_association","334305869_A_precision_viticulture_UAV-based_approach_for_early_yield_prediction_in_vineyard"]}
