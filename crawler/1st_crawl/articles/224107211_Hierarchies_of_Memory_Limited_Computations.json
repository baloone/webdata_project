{"id":"224107211_Hierarchies_of_Memory_Limited_Computations","abstract":"This paper investigates the computational complexity of binary sequences as measured by the rapidity of their generation by multitape Turing machines. A \"translational\" method which escapes some of the limitations of earlier approaches leads to a refinement of the established hierarchy. The previous complexity classes are shown to possess certain translational properties. An related hierarchy of complexity classes of monotonic functions is examined","authors":["R. E.
