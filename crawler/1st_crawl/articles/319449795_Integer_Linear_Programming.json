{"id":"319449795_Integer_Linear_Programming","abstract":"This chapter provides an introduction to Integer Linear Programming (ILP). After reviewing the effective modeling of a problem via ILP, the chapter describes the two main solving procedures for integer programs, i.e., branch-and-bound and cutting planes. The theory of totally unimodular matrices is introduced to account for problems whose models have naturally integer solutions. State-of-the-art solvers for mixed-integer linear programs are described at the conclusion.","authors":["Giuseppe Lancia","Paolo Serafini"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-63976-5_4","In book: Compact Extended Linear Programming Models (pp.43-66)"],"references":["265668231_Accelerating_Benders_Decomposition_Algorithmic_Enhancement_and_Model_Selection_Criteria","324368759_Linear_Programming_and_Economic_Analysis","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","273641867_Local_search_inequalities","271952885_Modified_orbital_branching_for_structured_symmetry_with_an_application_to_unit_commitment","268268150_The_Heuristic_Dark_Side_of_MIP_solvers","267087181_Computational_suggestions_for_maximizing_a_linear_function_subject_to_linear_inequalities","266909770_Principles_of_constraint_programming_Reprint_of_the_2003_hardback_ed","266230110_The_ongoing_story_of_Gomory_cuts","260139331_The_Gomory-Chvatal_Closure_of_a_Nonrational_Polytope_Is_a_Rational_Polytope"]}
