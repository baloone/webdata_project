Context awareness is an important facet of service oriented application creation dealing with the gathering, use and representation of context information. Generally, user interfaces and services communities work separately on the adaptation process and do not converge. The aim of this work is to manage the systemâ€™s functionalities and the user interface that delivers data to the relevant consumer early since the design phase until the code generation.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe authors discuss how a unified method based on a model-driven architecture for adaptive user interface and pervasive service creation eases the work of designers and developers, limits incompatibility issues and supports dynamic generation of systems adapted to different contexts of use.\n\nFindings\n\nThe proposed approach is able to support a semi-automatic ubiquitous application generation with service, behavior, presentation and content adaptation.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nIn this paper, the authors tackle context-awareness at two levels: system functionalities and user interface generation. The authors also tackle adaptation at the specification and implementation levels.","authors":["Hajer Taktak","Faouzi Moussa"],"meta":["August 2017International Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications 13(3):00-00","DOI:10.1108/IJPCC-10-2016-0054"],"references":["281462947_A_primer_on_the_Petri_Net_Markup_Language_and_ISOIEC_15909-2","269351212_Towards_a_runtime_evolutionary_model_of_user-adapted_interaction_in_a_ubiquitous_environment_the_RADEM_formal_model","266289448_User_and_Task_Models_Impact_on_an_Adaptive_User_Interface_for_the_Startup_of_a_Power_Plant","234787645_Context-aware_pervasive_service_composition_and_its_implementation","222218921_A_Unifying_Reference_Framework_for_Multi-Target_User_Interfaces","221053679_Structuring_and_Composition_Mechanisms_to_Address_Scalability_Issues_in_Task_Models","221015975_iCAP_Interactive_Prototyping_of_Context-Aware_Applications","220959689_Transformational_Development_of_User_Interfaces_with_Graph_Transformations","220826425_Software_Architecture-Based_Adaptation_for_Pervasive_Systems","220783478_The_Petri_Net_Markup_Language_Concepts_Technology_and_Tools","220674261_Adaptation_in_Context-Aware_Pervasive_Information_Systems_The_SECAS_Project","220609750_Taking_context_into_account_in_conceptual_models_using_a_Model_Driven_Engineering_approach","220535511_A_Petri-Net_Based_Context_Representation_in_Smart_Car_Environment","220286389_MARIA_A_universal_declarative_multiple_abstraction-level_language_for_service-oriented_applications_in_ubiquitous_environments","220135791_A_survey_on_context-aware_web_service_systems","274968606_A_formal_approach_for_modeling_context-aware_Human-Computer_System","224755595_Ontology-Based_Support_for_Human_Disease_Study","222865297_Context_modelling_and_a_context-aware_framework_for_pervasive_service_creation_A_model-driven_approach","222490617_UIML_An_appliance-independent_XML_user_interface_language","221430682_A_model_driven_architecture_approach_for_user_interface_generation_focused_on_content_personalization","221137715_Towards_Incremental_Execution_of_ATL_Transformations","221103666_A_Framework_for_Context-Aware_Adaptable_Web_Services","221096091_Mobile_Phone_Usability_Questionnaire_MPUQ_and_Automated_Usability_Evaluation","221052608_A_model-based_approach_for_real-time_embedded_multimodal_systems_in_military_aircrafts","220637894_Petri_net-based_context_modeling_for_context-aware_systems","220108256_Formal_description_and_evaluation_of_user-adapted_interfaces","3421543_Creating_Value_Added_Services_in_Internet_Telephony_An_Overview_and_a_Case_Study_on_a_High-Level_Service_Creation_Environment","3196665_Advanced_Service_Creation_Using_Distributed_Object_Technology","2338484_The_Use_Of_Situation_Theory_In_Context_Modeling"]}
