{"id":"251888585_Model_Predictive_Control_Design_and_implementation_using_MATLAB_T-3","abstract":"Model Predictive Control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control engineering. It is one of the few areas that have received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Three major aspects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both engineers and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the performance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engineering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and ‘tuned’ by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of method to handle both ‘soft’ constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform process on-line optimization.","authors":["Liuping Wang"],"meta":["January 2009Proceedings of the American Control Conference","DOI:10.1109/ACC.2009.5159781"],"references":[]}
