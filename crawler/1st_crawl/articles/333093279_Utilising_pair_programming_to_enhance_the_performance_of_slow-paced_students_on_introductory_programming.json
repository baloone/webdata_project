{"id":"333093279_Utilising_pair_programming_to_enhance_the_performance_of_slow-paced_students_on_introductory_programming","abstract":"Due to its high failure rate, Introductory Programming has become a main concern. One of the main issues is the incapability of slow-paced students to cope up with given programming materials. This paper proposes a learning technique which utilises pair programming to help slow-paced students on Introductory Programming; each slow-paced student is paired with a fast-paced student and the latter is encouraged to teach the former as a part of grading system. An evaluation regarding that technique has been conducted on three undergraduate classes from an Indonesian university for the second semester of 2018. According to the evaluation, the use of pair programming may help both slow-paced and fast-paced students. Nevertheless, it may not significantly affect individual academic performance.","authors":["Mewati Ayub","Oscar Karnalim","Risal","Wenny Franciska Senjaya"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of Technology and Science Education 9(3):357-367","DOI:10.3926/jotse.638"],"references":["326219431_Predicting_Successful_Collaboration_in_a_Pair_Programming_Eye_Tracking_Experiment","325920404_Combining_program_visualization_with_programming_workspace_to_assist_students_for_completing_programming_laboratory_task","323462365_A_Quasi-Experimental_Design_to_Evaluate_the_Use_of_PythonTutor_on_Programming_Laboratory_Session","316637163_An_Empirical_Study_on_the_Impact_of_an_IDE_Tool_Support_in_the_Pair_and_Solo_Programming","266660881_A_systematic_review_of_approaches_for_teaching_introductory_programming_and_their_influence_on_success","322515062_Does_pair_programming_work_in_a_data_science_context_An_initial_case_study","300116922_How_Equity_and_Inequity_Can_Emerge_in_Pair_Programming","262152619_Using_Alice_20_as_a_first_language","258162353_Knowledge_sharing_through_pair_programming_in_learning_environments_An_empirical_study","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","235353894_Investigating_the_effects_of_personality_traits_on_pairprogramming_in_a_higher_education_setting_through_afamily_of_experiments","222408325_The_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_A_meta-analysis","220094558_Voices_of_women_in_a_software_engineering_course_Reflections_on_collaboration","220069353_Empirical_Studies_of_Pair_Programming_for_CSSE_Teaching_in_Higher_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","220808534_Effects_of_team-based_learning_on_a_CS1_course"]}
