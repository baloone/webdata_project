{"id":"267642702_A_new_look_at_measuring_sustainability_of_industrial_parks_A_two-stage_data_envelopment_analysis_approach","abstract":"An industrial park is a community of manu-facturing and service businesses located together in a specific area. The sustainable industrial park is strategically significant for sustainable development of countries. In this paper, a gradual efficiency improvement data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is proposed to (i) measure sustain-ability of industrial parks, (ii) classify follower and pioneer industrial parks regarding the environmental performance, and (iii) direct the followers toward pioneers to gradually (not at once) improve their performance and make feasible improvement plans. The proposed method identifies deci-sion-making units (DMUs) on most productive scale size (MPSS) region, and then projects other DMUs onto this region. The proposed model is extended to evaluate per-formance of a two-stage network structures where outputs from the first stage become inputs to second stage in addition to inputs of first stage and outputs of second stage. The proposed approach is applied to measure the sustain-ability of 31 Iranian industrial parks. Despite traditional DEA methods, the results indicate that inputs (outputs) should not be necessarily decreased (increased) to project the industrial parks onto the MPSS region.
