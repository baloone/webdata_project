{"id":"280221190_Sharp_Time--Data_Tradeoffs_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","abstract":"In this paper we characterize sharp time-data tradeoffs for optimization\nproblems used for solving linear inverse problems. We focus on the minimization\nof a least-squares objective subject to a constraint defined as the sub-level\nset of a penalty function. We present a unified convergence analysis of the\ngradient projection algorithm applied to such problems. We sharply characterize\nthe convergence rate associated with a wide variety of random measurement\nensembles in terms of the number of measurements and structural complexity of\nthe signal with respect to the chosen penalty function. The results apply to\nboth convex and nonconvex constraints, demonstrating that a linear convergence\nrate is attainable even though the least squares objective is not strongly\nconvex in these settings. When specialized to Gaussian measurements our results\nshow that such linear convergence occurs when the number of measurements is\nmerely $4$ times the minimal number required to recover the desired signal at\nall (a.k.a. the phase transition). We also achieve a slower but geometric rate\nof convergence precisely above the phase transition point. Extensive numerical\nresults suggest that the derived rates exactly match the empirical performance.","authors":["Samet Oymak","Benjamin Recht","Mahdi Soltanolkotabi"],"meta":["July 2015IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2773497","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279309832_A_Geometric_View_on_Constrained_M-Estimators","272385688_Designing_Statistical_Estimators_That_Balance_Sample_Size_Risk_and_Computational_Cost","271532495_Decomposable_Norm_Minimization_with_Proximal-Gradient_Homotopy_Algorithm","267098788_On_Iterative_Hard_Thresholding_Methods_for_High-dimensional_M-Estimation","260232159_Dimensionality_Reduction_with_Subgaussian_Matrices_A_Unified_Theory","259105826_Simple_Bounds_for_Noisy_Linear_Inverse_Problems_with_Exact_Side_Information","258247540_The_squared-error_of_generalized_LASSO_A_precise_analysis","244418126_An_Iterative_Regularization_Method_for_Total_Variation-Based_Image_Restoration","230570680_Universality_in_Polytope_Phase_Transitions_and_Message_PassingAlgorithms","228883937_Bregman_Iterative_Algorithms_for_l1-Minimization_with_Applications_to_Compressed_Sensing","228325302_Restricted_Isometry_of_Fourier_Matrices_and_List_Decodability_of_RandomLinear_Codes","313503745_The_squared-error_of_generalized_LASSO_A_precise_analysis","309403355_Fast_and_Reliable_Parameter_Estimation_from_Nonlinear_Observations","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","301850545_Upper-bounding_ell_1-optimization_weak_thresholds","299696332_Random_Sampling_in_Bounded_Orthonormal_Systems","288927245_An_iterative_regularization_method_for_total_variation-based_image_restoration","288393244_Time-Data_Tradeoffs_by_Aggressive_Smoothing","282903909_Sharp_MSE_Bounds_for_Proximal_Denoising","278433201_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","278048059_Isometric_sketching_of_any_set_via_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property","272359217_The_Generalized_Lasso_With_Non-Linear_Observations","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information","268248371_Compressive_Sensing_and_Structured_Random_Matrices","266555174_The_generic_chaining_Upper_and_lower_bounds_of_stochastic_processes","263699198_Phase_Retrieval_via_Wirtinger_Flow_Theory_and_Algorithms","263201047_From_Denoising_to_Compressed_Sensing","262489127_Estimation_in_High_Dimensions_A_Geometric_Perspective","262148814_L-12_Regularization_A_Thresholding_Representation_Theory_and_a_Fast_Solver","261952462_Living_on_the_edge_Phase_transitions_in_convex_programs_with_random_data","261714256_Geometrizing_Local_Rates_of_Convergence_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","261673003_High-dimensional_estimation_with_geometric_constraints","260624455_Aperture_synthesis_with_a_non-regular_distribution_of_interferometer_baselines","260572321_Phase_Retrieval_from_Coded_Diffraction_Patterns","260490274_A_Probabilistic_and_RIPless_Theory_of_Compressed_Sensing","259528880_Learning_without_Concentration","258818945_A_performance_analysis_framework_for_SOCP_algorithms_in_noisy_compressed_sensing","258818591_A_framework_to_characterize_performance_of_LASSO_algorithms","258222850_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","257291640_A_method_of_solving_a_convex_programming_problem_with_convergence_rate_O1k2","252048553_Tight_Recovery_Thresholds_and_Robustness_Analysis_for_Nuclear_Norm_Minimization","243787569_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","240224724_Robust_modeling_with_erratic_data","239222885_Exact_signal_reconstruction_from_highly_incomplete_frequency_information","236687778_Regularized_M-estimators_With_Nonconvexity_Statistical_and_Algorithmic_Theory_for_Local_Optima","235906523_Computational_and_Statistical_Tradeoffs_via_Convex_Relaxation","232808969_Latent_Variable_Graphical_Model_Selection_Via_Convex_Optimization","228095922_Suprema_of_Chaos_Processes_and_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property","227101649_Exact_Matrix_Completion_via_Convex_Optimization","225551306_On_Milman's_inequality_and_random_subspaces_which_escape_through_a_mesh_in_Rn","224760568_Thresholds_for_the_Recovery_of_Sparse_Solutions_via_L1_Minimization","224312959_Iteratively_reweighted_algorithms_for_compressive_sensing","225546198_Reconstruction_and_Subgaussian_Operators_in_Asymptotic_Geometric_Analysis","224760569_Sparse_reconstruction_by_convex_relaxation_Fourier_and_Gaussian_measurements","224407607_Sharp_Thresholds_for_High-Dimensional_and_Noisy_Sparsity_Recovery_Using_-Constrained_Quadratic_Programming_Lasso"]}
