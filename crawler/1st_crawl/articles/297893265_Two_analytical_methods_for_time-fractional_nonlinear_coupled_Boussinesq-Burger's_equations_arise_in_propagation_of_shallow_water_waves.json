The Boussinesq–Burger’s equations arise in studying the fluid flow in a dynamic system and describe the propagation of the shallow water waves. Subsequently, the approximate solutions of time-fractional nonlinear coupled Boussinesq–Burger’s equations obtained by RPSM are compared with the exact solutions as well as the solutions obtained by modified homotopy analysis transform method. Then, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis and error estimate of RPSM. Numerical simulations of the results are depicted through different graphical representations and tables showing that present scheme is reliable and powerful in finding the numerical solutions of coupled system of fractional nonlinear differential equations like Boussinesq–Burger’s equations.","authors":["Dr. Sunil Kumar","Amit Kumar","Dumitru Baleanu"],"meta":["July 2016Nonlinear Dynamics 85(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-016-2716-2"],"references":["283541177_A_new_Legendre_operational_technique_for_delay_fractional_optimal_control_problems","275410597_A_Review_of_Operational_Matrices_and_Spectral_Techniques_for_Fractional_Calculus","312466660_Fractional_Differential_Equations_An_Introduction_to_Fractional_Derivatives","301257317_Local_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_applications","282726897_Homotopy_analysis_method_-_A_new_analytic_approach_for_highly_nonlinear_problems","277813598_Local_Fractional_Integral_Transforms_And_Their_Applications","276039944_Application_of_Variational_Iteration_Method_to_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_of_Fractional_Order","275177802_A_new_analytical_modelling_for_telegraph_equation_via_Laplace_transform","272899421_To_Alfred_Klemm_on_the_Occasion_of_his_100th_Birthday","272899012_A_Numerical_Study_for_the_Solution_of_Time_Fractional_Nonlinear_Shallow_Water_Equation_in_Oceans","269764534_A_numerical_technique_based_on_the_shifted_Legendre_polynomials_for_solving_the_time-fractional_coupled_KdV_equation","271280811_Series_Solution_of_Fuzzy_Differential_Equations_under_Strongly_Generalized_Differentiability","271202353_A_novel_expansion_iterative_method_for_solving_linear_partial_differential_equations_of_fractional_order","269764523_Efficient_Legendre_spectral_tau_algorithm_for_solving_two-sided_space-time_Caputo_fractional_advection-dispersion_equation","269764466_An_Efficient_Numerical_Scheme_for_Solving_Multi-Dimensional_Fractional_Optimal_Control_Problems_With_a_Quadratic_Performance_Index"]}
