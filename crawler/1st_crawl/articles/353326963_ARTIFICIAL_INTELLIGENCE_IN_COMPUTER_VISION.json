{"id":"353326963_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_COMPUTER_VISION","abstract":"Computer vision is an area of research concerned with assisting computers in seeing. Computer vision issues aim to infer something about the world from observed picture data at the most abstract level. It is a multidisciplinary subject that may be loosely classified as a branch of artificial intelligence and machine learning, both of which may include using specific techniques and using general-purpose learning methods. As an interdisciplinary field of research, it may seem disorganized, with methods taken and reused from various engineering and computer science disciplines. While one specific vision issue may be readily solved with a hand-crafted statistical technique, another may need a vast and sophisticated ensemble of generic machine learning algorithms. Computer vision as a discipline is at the cutting edge of science. As with any frontier, it is thrilling and chaotic, with often no trustworthy authority to turn to. Numerous beneficial concepts lack a theoretical foundation, and some theories are rendered ineffective in reality; developed regions are widely dispersed, and often one seems totally unreachable from the other.","authors":["Aryan Karn"],"meta":["July 2021","DOI:10.33564/IJEAST.2021.v06i01.037"],"references":["323174279_A_Guide_to_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Computer_Vision"]}
