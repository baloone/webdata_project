{"id":"347624256_AutoML_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) techniques have obtained remarkable achievements on various tasks, such as image recognition, object detection, and language modeling. However, building a high-quality DL system for a specific task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods-covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS)-with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms' performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research.","authors":["Xin He","Kaiyong Zhao","Xiaowen Chu"],"meta":["January 2021Knowledge-Based Systems 212:106622","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106622"],"references":["348871447_Benchmark_and_Survey_of_Automated_Machine_Learning_Frameworks","343466567_APQ_Joint_Search_for_Network_Architecture_Pruning_and_Quantization_Policy","342540658_Neural_Architecture_Search_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_and_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search","341402156_Architecture_Search_of_Dynamic_Cells_for_Semantic_Video_Segmentation","340606439_Overcoming_Multi-Model_Forgetting_in_One-Shot_NAS_With_Diversity_Maximization","339756299_EENA_Efficient_Evolution_of_Neural_Architecture","339563957_Auto-ReID_Searching_for_a_Part-Aware_ConvNet_for_Person_Re-Identification","339559090_Online_Hyper-Parameter_Learning_for_Auto-Augmentation_Strategy","339554739_Fast_and_Practical_Neural_Architecture_Search","339554653_AM-LFS_AutoML_for_Loss_Function_Search","339481778_Albumentations_Fast_and_Flexible_Image_Augmentations","339176693_On_Robustness_of_Neural_Architecture_Search_Under_Label_Noise","338503872_Fast_Neural_Architecture_Search_of_Compact_Semantic_Segmentation_Models_via_Auxiliary_Cells","337211521_One-Shot_Neural_Architecture_Search_via_Self-Evaluated_Template_Network","337211284_Searching_for_a_Robust_Neural_Architecture_in_Four_GPU_Hours","336148789_Towards_modular_and_programmable_architecture_search","353476146_Real-time_Federated_Evolutionary_Neural_Architecture_Search","352997548_IRS_A_Large_Naturalistic_Indoor_Robotics_Stereo_Dataset_to_Train_Deep_Models_for_Disparity_and_Surface_Normal_Estimation","351406512_Fast_Accurate_and_Lightweight_Super-Resolution_with_Neural_Architecture_Search","350478363_Bayesian_neural_architecture_search_using_a_training-free_performance_metric","346692304_Feature_Selection_for_Classification","345874699_Are_Labels_Necessary_for_Neural_Architecture_Search","344000406_You_Only_Search_Once_Single_Shot_Neural_Architecture_Search_via_Direct_Sparse_Optimization","343466717_GAN_Compression_Efficient_Architectures_for_Interactive_Conditional_GANs","343466257_Meta-Learning_of_Neural_Architectures_for_Few-Shot_Learning","343461447_MiLeNAS_Efficient_Neural_Architecture_Search_via_Mixed-Level_Reformulation","343461416_AdversarialNAS_Adversarial_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_GANs","343461365_Hit-Detector_Hierarchical_Trinity_Architecture_Search_for_Object_Detection","343456945_SGAS_Sequential_Greedy_Architecture_Search","343456743_When_NAS_Meets_Robustness_In_Search_of_Robust_Architectures_Against_Adversarial_Attacks","343456489_Densely_Connected_Search_Space_for_More_Flexible_Neural_Architecture_Search","343456402_SP-NAS_Serial-to-Parallel_Backbone_Search_for_Object_Detection","342295640_Hierarchical_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","341469770_Searching_Better_Architectures_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","341075580_Single-Path_NAS_Designing_Hardware-Efficient_ConvNets_in_Less_Than_4_Hours","339756296_Efficient_Structured_Pruning_and_Architecture_Searching_for_Group_Convolution","339562032_Auto-FPN_Automatic_Network_Architecture_Adaptation_for_Object_Detection_Beyond_Classification","339560902_Evolving_Space-Time_Neural_Architectures_for_Videos","339556415_AutoDispNet_Improving_Disparity_Estimation_With_AutoML","339555390_AutoGAN_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","339554584_Progressive_Differentiable_Architecture_Search_Bridging_the_Depth_Gap_Between_Search_and_Evaluation","338962150_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","338681784_Efficient_Multi-objective_Neural_Architecture_Search_via_Lamarckian_Evolution","338511824_AutoAugment_Learning_Augmentation_Strategies_From_Data","338510249_MnasNet_Platform-Aware_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_Mobile","338509389_FBNet_Hardware-Aware_Efficient_ConvNet_Design_via_Differentiable_Neural_Architecture_Search","338509164_Auto-DeepLab_Hierarchical_Neural_Architecture_Search_for_Semantic_Image_Segmentation","338503786_NAS-FPN_Learning_Scalable_Feature_Pyramid_Architecture_for_Object_Detection","336998965_Automatically_Learning_Data_Augmentation_Policies_for_Dialogue_Tasks","336352908_A_Survey_on_Data_Collection_for_Machine_Learning_A_Big_Data_-_AI_Integration_Perspective","335893716_FRAGE_Frequency-Agnostic_Word_Representation","335641987_Automated_deep_learning_design_for_medical_image_classification_by_health-care_professionals_with_no_coding_experience_a_feasibility_study","335830056_Improving_Keyword_Spotting_and_Language_Identification_via_Neural_Architecture_Search_at_Scale","335779019_Continual_and_Multi-Task_Architecture_Search","335606836_Multi-Fidelity_Automatic_Hyper-Parameter_Tuning_via_Transfer_Series_Expansion"]}
