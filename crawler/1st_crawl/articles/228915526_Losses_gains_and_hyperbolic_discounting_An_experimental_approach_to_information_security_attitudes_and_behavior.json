{"id":"228915526_Losses_gains_and_hyperbolic_discounting_An_experimental_approach_to_information_security_attitudes_and_behavior","abstract":"Surveys and experiments have uncovered a dichotomy between stated attitudes and actual behavior of individuals facing decisions affecting their privacy and their personal information security. Surveys report that most individuals are concerned about the security of their per-sonal information and are willing to act to protect it. Experiments reveal that very few individuals actually take any action to protect their personal information, even when doing so involves limited costs. In this paper we analyze the causes of this dichotomy. We discuss which economic considerations are likely to affect individual choice and we advance testable hypotheses about why individuals' information secu-rity attitudes seem inconsistent with their behavior. We then outline an experimental design to test our hypotheses. The experiment is de-signed to compare individuals' characteristics as market agents to their information security attitudes and behavior.","authors":["Alessandro Acquisti","Jens Grossklags"],"meta":["April 2003"],"references":["221599448_Online_Information_Privacy_Measuring_the_Cost-Benefit_Trade-Off","24108084_An_Economic_Theory_of_Self-Control","24091574_Golden_Eggs_and_Hyperbolic_Discounting","2919090_On_the_Economics_of_Anonymity","2480871_E-privacy_in_2nd_Generation_E-Commerce_Privacy_Preferences_Versus_actual_Behavior","267922538_Stigma_Notes_On_The_Management_of_A_Spoiled_Identity","250455912_Protecting_Privacy_with_Economics_Economic_Incentives_for_Preventive_Technologies_in_Ubiquitous_Computing_Environments","247928667_The_Market_for_Lemons_Quality_Uncertainty_and_the_Market_Mechanism","247885464_The_Foundation_of_Human_Society","246902103_Multiple_Processes_by_Which_Attitudes_Guide_Behavior_The_MODE_Model_as_an_Integrative_Framework","243774908_Professional_attitudes_and_actual_behavior","240126085_The_Economics_of_Immediate_Gratification","232566045_Effect_of_the_Severity_of_Threat_on_the_Devaluation_of_Forbidden_Behavior","227347943_Conditioning_Prices_on_Purchase_History","220420984_Untraceable_Electronic_Mail_Return_Addresses_and_Digital_Pseudonyms","220167332_Understanding_the_Privacy_Space","201381816_A_Theory_of_Cognitive_Dissonance","49304014_In_The_Psychology_of_Attitudes","41139133_Attitudes_vs_Actions","31840402_Attitudes_Personality_and_Behavior_I_Ajzen","24091726_Choice_And_Procrastination","9925304_Cognitive_Consequences_of_Forces_Compliance","5000055_Rational_Ignorance_at_the_Patent_Office","4901284_Altruism_the_Samaritan's_Dilemma_and_Government_Transfer_Policy","2935388_Protecting_Privacy_with_Economics","2858177_The_Cognitive_Consequences_of","2591499_Why_Johnny_Can't_Encrypt_A_Usability_Evaluation_of_PGP_50","2506641_Economic_Aspects_of_Personal_Privacy"]}
