{"id":"308818911_Discrete-time_flatness-based_control_for_a_twin_rotor_helicopter_with_an_Extended_Kalman_filter","abstract":"In this paper, a discrete-time flatness-based control for a twin rotor aerodynamic system with two degrees of freedom is proposed that outperforms a standard quasi-continuous implementation, cf. [1]. A control-oriented state-space model is derived using Lagrange's equations. The resulting nonlinear fourth-order model possesses two control inputs, and is affected by two unknown disturbance torques due to modelling simplifications and unmeasurable torques. Accordingly, a discrete-time Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate these lumped disturbances and unmeasurable states as well. The proposed control approach in combination with the discrete-time Extended Kalman Filter is implemented and validated on a laboratory test rig. The effectiveness of the discrete-time flatness-based control is highlighted by experimental results showing an excellent tracking behaviour.","authors":["Hao Sun","Saif Butt","Harald Aschemann"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/AIM.2016.7576818","Conference: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)"],"references":["318287009_Flatness_and_Sampling_Control_of_Induction_Motors","230872857_Flatness_and_defect_of_non-linear_systems_introductory_theory_and_examples","229040242_Discrete-time_flatness-based_control_of_an_electromagnetically_levitated_rotating_shaft","228826797_Control_of_a_Laboratory_Helicopter_Using_Feedback_Linearization","224598869_Nonlinear_robust_decoupling_control_design_for_twin_rotor_system","4073787_Parametric_modelling_of_a_twin_rotor_system_using_genetic_algorithms","325911017_Control_of_a_laboratory_helicopter_using_feedback_linearization","303296886_Comparison_of_Backstepping-Based_Sliding_Mode_and_Adaptive_Backstepping_for_a_Robust_Control_of_a_Twin_Rotor_Helicopter","282596247_Advanced_process_control_systems","281527891_Multi-Variable_Integral_Sliding_Mode_Control_of_a_Two_Degrees_of_Freedom_Helicopter","274827416_Mathematical_dynamic_modelling_of_a_twin-rotor_multiple_input-multiple_output_system","269111024_Multi-Variable_Flatness-Based_Control_of_a_Helicopter_with_Two_Degrees_of_Freedom","255522160_Advanced_control_system_for_B_and_W_PWRs","224756700_Performance_analysis_of_4_types_of_conjugate_gradient_algorithms_in_the_nonlinear_dynamic_modelling_of_a_TRMS_using_feedforward_neural_networks","222269738_Adaptive_backstepping_control_for_electrically_driven_unmanned_helicopter","220493925_Zur_zeitdiskreten_Implementierung_nichtlinearer_Regelgesetze_On_the_Discrete-time_Implementation_of_Nonlinear_Control_Laws","3882807_Dynamic_modeling_and_optimal_control_of_a_twin_rotor_MIMO_system"]}
