{"id":"315864773_Implementation_of_parallel_k-means_algorithm_for_two-phase_method_biclustering_in_Carcinoma_tumor_gene_expression_data","abstract":"Tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that serves no purpose. Carcinoma is a tumor that grows from the top of the cell membrane. In the field of molecular biology, the development of microarray technology is used in data store of disease genetic expression. For each of microarray gene, an amount of information is stored for each trait or condition. In gene expression data clustering can be done with a bicluster algorithm, thatâ€™s clustering method not only the objects to be clustered, but also the properties or condition of the object. This research proposed a two-phase method for finding a bicluster. In the first phase, a parallel k-means algorithm is applied to the gene expression data. Then, in the second phase, Cheng and Church biclustering algorithm as one of biclustering method is performed to find biclusters. In this study, we discuss the implementation of two-phase method using biclustering of Cheng and Church and parallel k-means algorithm in Carcinomatumor gene expression data. From the experimental results, we found five biclusters are formed by Carcinoma gene expression data.","authors":["Gianinna Ardaneswari","Alhadi Bustamam","Titin Siswantining"],"meta":["March 2017AIP Conference Proceedings 1825(1)","DOI:10.1063/1.4978973","Project: PUPT 2016-2017"],"references":["320688251_Implementation_of_plaid_model_biclustering_method_on_microarray_of_carcinoma_and_adenoma_tumor_gene_expression_data","279987110_Biclustering_on_Expression_Data_A_Review","262723976_Performance_Evaluation_of_Fast_Smith-Waterman_Algorithm_for_Sequence_Database_Searches_using_CUDA_GPU-Based_Parallel_Computing","12345321_Biclustering_of_Expression_Data","6748133_Biclustering_algorithms_for_biological_data_analysis_a_survey_IEEEACM_Trans_Comput_Biol_Bioinform_124-45","2318816_Plaid_Models_for_Gene_Expression_Data","284391108_Biclustering_of_Gene_Expression_Data_using_a_Two_-_Phase_Method","232627133_An_Efficient_K-Means_Clustering_Algorithm_Analysis_and_Implementation","223832334_Improved_Biclustering_of_Microarray_Data_Demonstrated_through_Systematic_Performance_Tests","11495258_Statistical_Inference_for_Simultaneous_Clustering_of_Gene_Expression_Data"]}
