Graduates’ perceived levels \nof professional efficacy showed that majority of th\ne top rated character traits essential in their \nwork has something to do with working with others. \nThis study concluded that tracing the \nSME graduates revealed the institutional capability\nof the Science and Mathematics \nEducation Department (SMED) and the relevance of it\ns curricular programs. It is further \nrecommended to update the current curriculum to be \nK-12 ready foreseeing that the future \ngraduates should be developed to teach confidently \nin light of the Philippine educational \nreform.","authors":["Monell John Fernandez Cañizares"],"meta":["January 2015International Journal of Research Studies in Education 4(2)","DOI:10.5861/ijrse.2015.985"],"references":["283857143_Retaining_Teachers_How_Preparation_Matters","258164110_Teacher_Training_and_Pre-service_Primary_Teachers'_Self-Efficacy_for_Science_Teaching","257636353_Development_and_use_of_a_test_instrument_to_measure_biology_teachers'_content_knowledge_CK_and_pedagogical_content_knowledge_PCK","234605428_Sources_of_Self-Efficacy_Four_Professional_Development_Formats_and_Their_Relationship_to_Self-Efficacy_and_Implementation_of_a_New_Teaching_Strategy","292640914_Employment_and_employability_profile_of_a_select_group_of_Filipino_college_graduates","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","269788842_A_tracer_study_of_the_East_African_School_of_Libraryand_Information_Science_graduates_1995-1999_working_in_Uganda","251296876_Graduates'_views_on_the_contribution_of_their_higher_education_to_their_general_development_A_retrospective_evaluation_for_the_United_Kingdom","248811315_Tracer_study_of_the_Botswana_library_school_graduates","226805404_Preservice_Elementary_Teachers'_Beliefs_About_Science_Teaching"]}
