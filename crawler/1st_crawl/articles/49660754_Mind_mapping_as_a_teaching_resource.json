{"id":"49660754_Mind_mapping_as_a_teaching_resource","abstract":"Modern mind mapping has been around since the mid-1970s, having been developed in its current form by Tony Buzan. It works by taking information from several sources and displaying this information as key words in a bright, colourful manner. Mind maps have been described as an effective study technique when applied to written material.\nThis paper looks at how to use mind mapping as a teaching resource, and was written as a result of the recent undergraduate 'Doctors as Teachers' conference at The Peninsula Medical School.\nMind mapping is a technique not often used or considered by many teachers. This paper looks at how a busy clinical teacher can apply this technique in a practical, useable way. This allows topics to be more interesting to students and makes both learning and teaching more enjoyable.\nMind mapping has many potential applications to clinical education, and can be adapted to many situations. It can be used as a teaching resource, as an aid to preparing and reviewing lectures, and the technique allows notes to be written and reviewed quickly, and most importantly enables information to be easily updated. Mind mapping can be used in many situations including problem-based learning, small-group teaching, in a one-to-one context, as an examination tool and for personal revision.","authors":["Sarah Louise Edwards","Nick Cooper"],"meta":["December 2010The Clinical Teacher 7(4):236-9","DOI:10.1111/j.1743-498X.2010.00395.x","SourcePubMed"],"references":["11344656_The_efficacy_of_the_'mind_map'_study_technique","229100761_The_Mind_Map_Book"]}
