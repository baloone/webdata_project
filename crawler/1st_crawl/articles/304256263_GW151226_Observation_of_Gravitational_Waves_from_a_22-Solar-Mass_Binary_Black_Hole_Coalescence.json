{"id":"304256263_GW151226_Observation_of_Gravitational_Waves_from_a_22-Solar-Mass_Binary_Black_Hole_Coalescence","abstract":"We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5σ. The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3.4^(+0.7)_(-0.9) ×10^(-22). The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are 14.2^(+8.3)_(-3.7) M⊙ and 7.5^(+2.3)_(-2.3) M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 20.8^(+6.1)_(-1.7) M⊙. We find that at least one of the component black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity distance of 440^(+180)_(-190) Mpc corresponding to a redshift of 0.09^(+0.03)_(-0.04). All uncertainties define a 90% credible interval. This second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar populations and on deviations from general relativity.","authors":["B.P. Abbott","R. Abbott","R. X. Adhikari","S.
