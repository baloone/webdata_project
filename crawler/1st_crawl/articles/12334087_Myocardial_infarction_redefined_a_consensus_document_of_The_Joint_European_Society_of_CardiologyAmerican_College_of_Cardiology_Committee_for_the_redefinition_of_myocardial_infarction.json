Criteria for acute, evolving or recent MI. Either one of the following criteria satisfies the diagnosis for an acute, evolving or recent MI: 1) Typical rise and gradual fall (troponin) or more rapid rise and fall (CK-MB) of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis with at least one of the following: a) ischemic symptoms; b) development of pathologic Qwaves on the ECG; c) ECG changes indicative of ischemia (ST segment elevation or depression); or d) coronary artery intervention (e.g., coronary angioplasty). 2) Pathologic findings of an acute MI. Criteria for established MI. Any one of the following criteria satisfies the diagnosis for established MI: 1) Development of new pathologic Q waves on serial ECGs. The patient may or may not remember previous symptoms. Biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis may have normalized, depending on the length of time that has passed since the infarct developed. 2) Pathologic findings of a healed or healing MI.","authors":["Joseph S Alpert","K Thygesen","E Antman","J P Bassand"],"meta":["October 2000Journal of the American College of Cardiology 36(3):959-69","SourcePubMed"],"references":["14480058_Geriatric_patients_with_acute_myocardial_infarction_Cardiac_risk_factor_profiles_presentation_thrombolysis_coronary_interventions_and_prognosis"]}
