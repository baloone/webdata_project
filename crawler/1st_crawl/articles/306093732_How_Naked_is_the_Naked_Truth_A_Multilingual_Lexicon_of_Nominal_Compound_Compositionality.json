{"id":"306093732_How_Naked_is_the_Naked_Truth_A_Multilingual_Lexicon_of_Nominal_Compound_Compositionality","abstract":"We introduce a new multilingual resource containing judgments about nominal compound compositionality in English, French and Portuguese. It covers 3 Ã— 180 noun-noun and adjective-noun compounds for which we provide numerical compositionality scores for the head word, for the modifier and for the compound as a whole, along with possible paraphrases. This resource was constructed by native speakers via crowdsourcing. It can serve as basis for evaluating tasks such as lexical substitution and compositionality prediction.","authors":["Carlos Ramisch","Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro","Leonardo Zilio","Marco Idiart"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.18653/v1/P16-2026","Conference: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)Volume: 2"],"references":["326718307_The_Unexpected_Effects_of_Applying_Standard_Cleansing_Models_to_Human_Ratings_on_Compositionality","301446029_Learning_Semantic_Composition_to_Detect_Non-compositionality_of_Multiword_Expressions","271702364_Combining_Different_Features_of_Idiomaticity_for_the_Automatic_Classification_of_NounVerb_Expressions_in_Basque","267448188_Inter-Coder_Agreement_for_Computational_Linguistics","267250917_An_Empirical_Study_on_Compositionality_in_Compound_Nouns","251186613_Paraphrasing_Verbs_for_Noun_Compound_Interpretation","337464720_Identification_of_multiword_expressions_in_the_brWaC","301404716_A_Word_Embedding_Approach_to_Predicting_the_Compositionality_of_Multiword_Expressions","301404672_A_Multiword_Expression_Data_Set_Annotating_Non-Compositionality_and_Conventionalization_for_English_Noun_Compounds","282303179_Multiword_Expressions_Acquisition_A_Generic_and_Open_Framework"]}
