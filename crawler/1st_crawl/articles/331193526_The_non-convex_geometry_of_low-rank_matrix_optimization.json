{"id":"331193526_The_non-convex_geometry_of_low-rank_matrix_optimization","abstract":"This work considers two popular minimization problems: (i) the minimization of a general convex function f(X) with the domain being positive semi-definite matrices, and (ii) the minimization of a general convex function f(X) regularized by the matrix nuclear norm |$\\|X\\|_{*}$| with the domain being general matrices. Despite their optimal statistical performance in the literature, these two optimization problems have a high computational complexity even when solved using tailored fast convex solvers. To develop faster and more scalable algorithms, we follow the proposal of Burer and Monteiro to factor the low-rank variable |$X = UU^{\\top } $| (for semi-definite matrices) or |$X=UV^{\\top } $| (for general matrices) and also replace the nuclear norm |$\\|X\\|_{*}$| with |$\\big(\\|U\\|_{F}^{2}+\\|V\\|_{F}^{2}\\big)/2$|‚Å†. In spite of the non-convexity of the resulting factored formulations, we prove that each critical point either corresponds to the global optimum of the original convex problems or is a strict saddle where the Hessian matrix has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Such a nice geometric structure of the factored formulations allows many local-search algorithms to find a global optimizer even with random initializations.","authors":["Qiuwei Li","Zhihui Zhu","Gongguo Tang"],"meta":["January 2018Information and Inference A Journal of the IMA 8(1)","DOI:10.1093/imaiai/iay003","Project: Nonconvex Optimization"],"references":["320920671_Provable_quantum_state_tomography_via_non-convex_methods","320564745_First-order_Methods_Almost_Always_Avoid_Saddle_Points","317241072_Gradient_Descent_Can_Take_Exponential_Time_to_Escape_Saddle_Points","328033911_Finding_Low-Rank_Solutions_via_Nonconvex_Matrix_Factorization_Efficiently_and_Provably","325071570_Global_Optimality_in_Low-Rank_Matrix_Optimization","324629750_Convex_and_nonconvex_geometries_of_symmetric_tensor_factorization","323719139_Global_optimality_in_low-rank_matrix_optimization","321620224_Numerical_Optimization","319770239_Identifying_and_attacking_the_saddle_point_problem_in_high-dimensional_non-convex_optimization","315764942_No_Spurious_Local_Minima_in_Nonconvex_Low_Rank_Problems_A_Unified_Geometric_Analysis"]}
