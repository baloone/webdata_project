{"id":"282296422_Analysis_of_AOMDV_AODV_DSR_and_DSDV_routing_protocols_for_wireless_sensor_network","abstract":"In wireless sensor network (WSN), data collecting from the environment and sending that data to be processed and evaluated is the most important issues. Hence performance evaluation and comparison between routing protocols is required because performance of any routing protocol can be changed or very with various parameters such as speed, seed time, pause time, number of node, and traffic scenario (network topology). In this paper routing protocol AODV, AOMDV, DSR and DSDV has been analyzed by comparing the different performance matrices such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), loss packet ratio (LPR), and average end to end delay (Average End to End) with varying pause time and number of node under TCP & CBR connection via network simulator NS2.35 for wireless sensor network.","authors":["Bijan Paul","Kaysar Ahmed Bhuiyan","Kaniz Fatema","Partha Pratim Das"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1109/CICN.2014.88"],"references":["320385996_A_Firefly_Based_Energy_Efficient_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","271245192_Proficient_Energy_Consumption_Aware_Model_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","267765745_Comparison_and_Performance_Evaluation_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_with_different_Routing_Protocols","265260806_Impact_of_Variation_in_Pause_Time_and_Network_Load_in_AODV_and_AOMDV_Protocols","49617088_Performance_Comparison_and_Analysis_of_DSDV_and_AODV_for_MANET","2734335_Highly_Dynamic_Destination-Sequenced_Distance-Vector_Routing_DSDV_for_Mobile_Computers","315368130_Comparison_of_Technical_Features_of_Transport_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","284602848_Performance_Comparison_of_AODV_DSDV_OLSR_and_DSR_Routing_Protocols_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","283043711_An_Efficient_Condensed_Cluster_Stable_Election_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","264889417_Comparative_Performance_Study_of_Zone_Routing_Protocol_over_AODV_and_DSR_Routing_Protocols_on_Constant_Bit_Rate_CBR","226663966_Dynamic_Source_Routing_in_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","3942162_Ad_hoc_On-demand_Multipath_Distance_Vector_Routing"]}
