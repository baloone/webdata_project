{"id":"307858446_Type_Theory_for_Natural_Language_Semantics","abstract":"Type theory was originally designed in order to overcome problems in the formalization of mathematics. It has made an immense contribution to the study of the foundations of mathematics, logic and computer science and has also played a central role in formal semantics for natural languages since the initial work of Richard Montague building on the typed $\\lambda$-calculus. More recently, type theories following in the tradition created by Per Martin-LÃ¶f have presented an important alternative to Montague's type theory for semantic analysis. \n\nIn this article we give a brief history of the development of type theory and discuss some of the ways in which various type theories differ and the relevance of this for natural language semantics.","authors":["Stergios Chatzikyriakidis","Robin Cooper"],"meta":["August 2016","Project: Modern Type Theories for Natural Language Semantics"],"references":["315676199_A_Type-Theoretical_system_for_the_FraCaS_test_suite_Grammatical_Framework_meets_Coq","313828086_Adjectival_and_Adverbial_Modification_The_View_from_Modern_Type_Theories","313409694_On_the_Interpretation_of_Common_Nouns_Types_Versus_Predicates","319716055_Semantics_-_Mathematics_or_Psychology","319395047_Grammatical_Framework_Programming_with_Multilingual_Grammars","319394269_Intuitionistic_Type_Theory","319393811_Intensional_and_Higher-Order_Modal_Logic","313409650_Adapting_Type_Theory_with_Records_for_Natural_Language_Semantics","312435057_Situations_and_Attitudes","290586309_Constructive_Generalized_Quantifiers_Revisited"]}
