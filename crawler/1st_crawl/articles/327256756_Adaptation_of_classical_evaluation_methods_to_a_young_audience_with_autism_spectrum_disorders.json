{"id":"327256756_Adaptation_of_classical_evaluation_methods_to_a_young_audience_with_autism_spectrum_disorders","abstract":"In order to validate the usability and utility of an application, it is necessary to evaluate it. Many methods exist. The choice of these is defined by the availability of the application and the end users. But other parameters impact this choice as the context of use of the tool as well as the specificities of the public. The methods most commonly used when the application and the users are available, rely predominantly on verbal exchanges, in individual and group interviews. We want to evaluate an application dedicated to a young audience with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders). Apart from this audience, there are difficulties in the areas of communication and social interactions. Therefore, how can we evaluate an application dedicated to this particular audience while involving it? We propose an adaptation of classical evaluation methods based on the environment and the human environment of the users.","authors":["Marine Guffroy"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1145/3132129.3132140","Conference: the 29th Conference"],"references":["308199451_Research_methods_for_children_with_multiple_needs_Developing_techniques_to_facilitate_all_children_and_young_people_to_have_'a_voice'","286920675_Classification_francaise_des_troubles_mentaux_de_l'enfant_et_de_l'adolescent_R-2012","265847859_L'evaluation_de_documents_multimedias_etat_de_l'art","263352650_Criteres_et_methodes_d'evaluation_des_systemes_interactifs_Application_a_un_poste_de_regulation_dans_le_domaine_des_transports","254005128_Developing_IDEAS_Supporting_children_with_Autism_within_a_participatory_design_team","233851653_Supporting_the_Design_Contributions_of_Children_With_Autism_Spectrum_Conditions","233851652_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Future_Perspectives_in_Including_Children_with_Disabilities_in_the_Design_of_Interactive_Technology","221652334_The_ethnographically_informed_participatory_design_of_a_PDA_application_to_support_communication","221515020_vSked_Evaluation_of_a_System_to_Support_Classroom_Activities_for_Children_with_Autism","221238382_Smartphones_to_facilitate_communication_and_improve_social_skills_of_children_with_severe_autism_spectrum_disorder","220141494_Multitouch_tablet_applications_and_activities_to_enhance_the_social_skills_of_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorders","215639346_Designing_Technology_for_Children_with_Special_Needs_-_Bridging_Perspectives_through_Participatory_Design","43606087_Evaluation_ergonomique_des_interfaces_homme-machine_use_revue_de_la_literature","8925893_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Computer-Animated_Tutor_for_Vocabulary_and_Language_Learning_in_Children_with_Autism","311465314_The_ethnographically_informed_participatory_design_of_a_PD_application_to_support_communication","291047287_Environmental_design_and_adaptation_to_the_visual_environment_of_the_elderly","247915252_The_Instrumental_Method_in_Psychology","239065257_Autism_and_information_technology_Therapy_with_computers","233856350_Development_of_Software_that_Supports_the_Improvement_of_the_Empathy_in_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder","222652209_Computer_mediated_interaction_in_Asperger's_syndrome_The_Bubble_Dialogue_program"]}
