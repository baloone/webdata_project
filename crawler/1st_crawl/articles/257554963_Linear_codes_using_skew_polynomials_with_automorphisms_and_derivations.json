{"id":"257554963_Linear_codes_using_skew_polynomials_with_automorphisms_and_derivations","abstract":"In this work the definition of codes as modules over skew polynomial rings of automorphism type is generalized to skew polynomial rings, whose multiplication is defined using an automorphism and a derivation. This produces a more general class of codes which, in some cases, produce better distance bounds than module skew codes constructed only with an automorphism. Extending the approach of Gabidulin codes, we introduce new notions of evaluation of skew polynomials with derivations and the corresponding evaluation codes. We propose several approaches to generalize Reed-Solomon and BCH codes to module skew codes and for two classes we show that the dual of such a Reed-Solomon type skew code is an evaluation skew code. We generalize a decoding algorithm due to Gabidulin for the rank metric and derive families of Maximum Distance Separable and Maximum Rank Distance codes.","authors":["Delphine Boucher","Felix Ulmer"],"meta":["January 2013Designs Codes and Cryptography 70(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-012-9704-4"],"references":["295214210_On_ore_rings_linear_operators_and_factorization","275813212_Free_Rings_and_Their_Relations","274228936_Finite_Fields","267334617_Free_Rings_and_their_Relations","266513044_On_Ore_rings_linear_operators_and_factorization","265458700_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","256206327_Vandermonde_and_Wronskian_matrices_over_division_rings","246995074_On_a_Special_Class_of_Polynomials","242619135_Theory_of_Non-Commutative_Polynomials","239328737_A_general_theory_of_Vandermonde_matrices"]}
