{"id":"311754184_Automatic_3D_Car_Model_Alignment_for_Mixed_Image-Based_Rendering","abstract":"Image-Based Rendering (IBR) allows good-quality free-viewpoint navigation in urban scenes, but suffers from artifacts on poorly reconstructed objects, e.g., reflective surfaces such as cars. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method that automatically identifies stock 3D models, aligns them in the 3D scene and performs morphing to better capture image contours. We do this by first adapting learning-based methods to detect and identify an object class/pose in images. We then propose a method which exploits all available information, namely partial and inaccurate 3D reconstruction, multi-view calibration, image contours and the 3D model to achieve accurate object alignment suitable for subsequent morphing. These steps provide models which are well-aligned in 3D and to contours in all the images of the multi-view dataset, allowing us to use the resulting model in our mixed IBR algorithm. Our results show significant improvement in image quality for free-viewpoint IBR, especially when moving far from the captured viewpoints.","authors":["Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon","Abdelaziz Djelouah","Francisco Massa","Mathieu Aubry"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/3DV.2016.37","Conference: 2016 Fourth International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)"],"references":["308855598_A_Bayesian_Approach_for_Selective_Image-Based_Rendering_Using_Superpixels","308842942_Displets_Resolving_stereo_ambiguities_using_object_knowledge","286513323_ShapeNet_An_Information-Rich_3D_Model_Repository","269710334_Estimating_Image_Depth_Using_Shape_Collections","268079628_How_transferable_are_features_in_deep_neural_networks","262425949_3-Sweep_Extracting_Editable_Objects_from_a_Single_Photo","262354511_Depth_Synthesis_and_Local_Warps_for_Plausible_Image-Based_Navigation","256964856_Model-Based_Vehicle_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_in_Videos_Using_Random_Forests","243686365_Object_recognition_using_alignment","241770289_Interactive_Images_Cuboid_Proxies_for_Smart_Image_Manipulation","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","224254950_Nonlinear_shape_manifolds_as_shape_priors_in_level_set_segmentation_and_tracking","221305240_Robust_3D_Pose_Estimation_and_Efficient_2D_Region-Based_Segmentation_from_a_3D_Shape_Prior","220659404_Stereo_for_Image-Based_Rendering_using_Image_Over-Segmentation","45821311_A_Nonrigid_Kernel-Based_Framework_for_2D-3D_Pose_Estimation_and_2D_Image_Segmentation","44683582_Accurate_Dense_and_Robust_Multiview_Stereopsis","38412938_Unstructured_Lumigraph_Rendering","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311609704_Deep_Exemplar_2D-3D_Detection_by_Adapting_from_Real_to_Rendered_Views","304409693_Understanding_Deep_Features_with_Computer-Generated_Imagery","302888541_Crisp_Boundary_Detection_Using_Pointwise_Mutual_Information","300412630_Single_Image_Pop-Up_from_Discriminatively_Learned_Parts","290109912_Simultaneous_Monocular_2D_Segmentation_3D_Pose_Recovery_and_3D_Reconstruction","290091170_Jointly_Optimizing_3D_Model_Fitting_and_Fine-Grained_Classification","281050632_Seeing_3D_Chairs_Exemplar_Part-Based_2D-3D_Alignment_Using_a_Large_Dataset_of_CAD_Models","276300585_High-Quality_Depth_Estimation_Using_an_Exemplar_3D_Model_for_Stereo_Conversion","275973799_Object_Detection_via_a_Multi-region_and_Semantic_Segmentation-Aware_CNN_Model","274902714_A_Coarse-to-Fine_Model_for_3D_Pose_Estimation_and_Sub-category_Recognition","274474507_3D_Object_Manipulation_in_a_Single_Photograph_using_Stock_3D_Models","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262771911_Correspondence_and_Depth-Image_Based_Rendering_a_Hybrid_Approach_for_Free-Viewpoint_Video","262219459_Parsing_IKEA_objects_Fine_pose_estimation","261447449_Towards_Linear-Time_Incremental_Structure_from_Motion","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","246740134_Machine_perception_of_3-D_solids","225206403_The_Viewpoint_Consistency_Constraint","224254953_Multi-View_Reconstruction_Preserving_Weakly-Supported_Surfaces","224203467_Vehicle_Surveillance_with_a_Generic_Adaptive_3D_Vehicle_Model","221362726_Multi-View_Stereo_Revisited","221361999_Multicore_bundle_adjustment","221259505_PWP3D_Real-time_Segmentation_and_Tracking_of_3D_Objects","221111551_Smooth_Object_Retrieval_using_a_Bag_of_Boundaries","220659841_A_Review_of_Statistical_Approaches_to_Level_Set_Segmentation_Integrating_Color_Texture_Motion_and_Shape","220184195_Photo_tourism_exploring_photo_collections_in_3D_ACM_Trans_Graph_253835-846","220183673_Photo-Inspired_Model-Driven_3D_Object_Modeling","47861955_Three-Dimensional_Shape_Knowledge_for_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Pose_Tracking","2908246_The_Lumigraph","27542864_A_Framework_for_Image_Segmentation_Using_Shape_Models_and_Kernel_Space_Shape_Priors","4301444_Multi-View_Stereo_for_Community_Photo_Collections","4246329_Single_View_Reconstruction_of_Curved_Surfaces","3897594_Efficient_Variants_of_the_ICP_Algorithm"]}
