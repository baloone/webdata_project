{"id":"309524854_Effective_Educational_Videos_Principles_and_Guidelines_for_Maximizing_Student_Learning_from_Video_Content","abstract":"Educational videos have become an important part of higher education, providing an important content-delivery tool in many flipped, blended, and online classes. Effective use of video as an educational tool is enhanced when instructors consider three elements: how to manage cognitive load of the video; how to maximize student engagement with the video; and how to promote active learning from the video. This essay reviews literature relevant to each of these principles and suggests practical ways instructors can use these principles when using video as an educational tool.","authors":["Cynthia J Brame"],"meta":["October 2016CBE life sciences education 15(4):es6-es6","DOI:10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125"],"references":["285652054_Audio-Visual_Aid_in_Teaching_Fatty_Liver","283389538_'Teachers_flipping_out'_beyond_the_online_lecture_Maximising_the_educational_potential_of_video","272365169_Enhancing_Attention_and_Memory_During_Video-Recorded_Lectures","262393281_How_video_production_affects_student_engagement_An_empirical_study_of_MOOC_videos","262267588_Active_Learning_Increases_Student_Performance_in_Science_Engineering_and_Mathematics","253772914_Nine_Ways_to_Reduce_Cognitive_Load_in_Multimedia_Learning","248701403_Screencast_Tutorials_Enhance_Student_Learning_of_Statistics","237268918_The_Power_of_Testing_Memory_Basic_Research_and_Implications_for_Educational_Practice","236193301_Interpolated_memory_tests_reduce_mind_wandering_and_improve_learning_of_online_lectures","235797271_Figure_Facts_Encouraging_Undergraduates_to_Take_a_Data-Centered_Approach_to_Reading_Primary_Literature","235675928_Exploring_the_Use_of_Video_Podcasts_in_Education_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_the_Literature","233049779_Effects_of_segmenting_signalling_and_weeding_on_learning_from_educational_video","231610455_Self-Regulated_Learning_Beliefs_Techniques_and_Illusions","225319782_Towards_a_Framework_for_Attention_Cueing_in_Instructional_Animations_Guidelines_for_Research_and_Design","225186579_Promoting_Student_Metacognition","222407026_Instructional_video_in_e-learning_Assessing_the_impact_of_interactive_video_on_learning_effectiveness","51187214_Increased_Structure_and_Active_Learning_Reduce_the_Achievement_Gap_in_Introductory_Biology","23478495_Applying_the_Science_of_Learning_Evidence-Based_Principles_for_the_Design_of_Multimedia_Instruction","7429089_Teaching_More_by_Lecturing_Less","286849937_The_Impact_of_a_Question-Embedded_Video-based_Learning_Tool_on_E-learning","284971556_Multimedia_learning_and_games","281337327_Blended_Learning_Improves_Science_Education","277080577_Test-Enhanced_Learning_The_Potential_for_Testing_to_Promote_Greater_Learning_in_Undergraduate_Science_Courses","274585268_Effects_of_video_podcasting_on_psychomotor_and_cognitive_performance_attitudes_and_study_behaviour_of_student_physical_therapists","262329183_Short_videos_improve_student_learning_in_online_education","260482172_Overcoming_Overconfidence_in_Learning_from_Video-Recorded_Lectures_Implications_of_Interpolated_Testing_for_Online_Education","259514436_The_effects_of_technology_use_in_postsecondary_education_A_meta-analysis_of_classroom_applications","256146267_Everyday_Attention_Variation_in_Mind_Wandering_and_Memory_in_a_Lecture","240237564_Guided_Notes_and_Interactive_Methods_for_Teaching_with_Videotapes","237351247_The_Effect_of_Context-Based_Video_Instruction_on_Learning_and_Motivation_in_Online_Courses","233476914_Guiding_Questions_Enhance_Student_Learning_From_Educational_Videos","232540768_Revising_the_Redundancy_Principle_in_Multimedia_Learning","232497815_Cognitive_Technology_Some_Procedures_for_Facilitating_Learning_and_Problem_Solving_in_Mathematics_and_Science","228233944_Video_Killed_the_Textbook_Star_Use_of_Multimedia_Supplements_to_Enhance_Student_Learning","225464456_Cognitive_load_theory_educational_research_and_instructional_design_Some_food_for_thought","223814726_Cognitive_Load_Theory_Learning_Difficulty_and_Instructional_Design","222466354_Cognitive_Load_During_Problem_Solving_Effects_on_Learning","51640248_Video_laboratories_for_the_teaching_and_learning_of_professional_ethics_in_exercise_physiology_curricula","44840198_Evaluation_of_Evidence-Based_Practices_in_Online_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Review_of_Online_Learning_Studies","44361449_Interaction_of_media_cognition_and_learning_Gabriel_Salomon"]}
