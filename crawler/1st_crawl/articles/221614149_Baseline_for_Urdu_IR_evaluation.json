{"id":"221614149_Baseline_for_Urdu_IR_evaluation","abstract":"Goal of conferences like TREC, TIPSTER, NTCIR, CLEF is to judge the performance of different algorithms. Most of these conferences have tracks that deal with new and innovative information retrieval problems, but none has tackled to work with Urdu data, primarily because of the lack of resources. In this paper we present a baseline for Urdu IR evaluation along with resources necessary to do the task. The goal of this paper is to explore the strategy for creation of the test reference collection for Urdu Information Retrieval. A small test reference collection is presented composed of news articles from the Web along with some experiments to show its effectiveness.","authors":["Kashif Riaz"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1145/1460027.1460045","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceeding of the 2nd ACM workshop on Improving Non English Web Searching, iNEWS 2008, Napa Valley, California, USA, October 30, 2008"],"references":["220466737_Overview_of_the_INEX_2007_book_search_track_BookSearch_'07","2599740_Requirements_Tools_and_Architectures_for_Annotated_Corpora","244509085_The_Lemur_Toolkit_for_Language_Modeling_and_Information_Retrieval"]}
