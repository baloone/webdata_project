{"id":"340330135_Response_to_the_COVID-19_Epidemic_The_Chinese_Experience_and_Implications_for_Other_Countries","abstract":"The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that occurred in China is rapidly spreading globally. Chinaâ€™s bond and strict containment measures have been proved (in practice) to significantly reduce the spread of the epidemic. This was obtained through the use of emergency control measures in the epidemic areas and the integration of resources from multiple systems, including business, community, technology, education, and transportation, across the country. In order to better understand how China has managed to reduce the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, this editorial systematically reviews the specific measures for infection prevention and control of the disease. The best practices for COVID-19 eradication in China provide evidence-based strategies that could be replicated in other countries.","authors":["Wei Liu","Xiao-Guang Yue","Paul B.
