{"id":"357162627_A_Multi-RNN_Research_Topic_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Spatial_Attention_and_Semantic_Consistency-Based_Scientific_Influence_Modeling","abstract":"Computer science discipline includes many research fields, which mutually influence and promote each otherâ€™s development. This poses two great challenges of predicting the research topics of each research field. One is how to model fine-grained topic representation of a research field. The other is how to model research topic of different fields and keep the semantic consistency of research topics when learning the scientific influence context from other related fields. Unfortunately, the existing research topic prediction approaches cannot handle these two challenges. To solve these problems, we employ multiple different Recurrent Neural Network chains which model research topics of different fields and propose a research topic prediction model based on spatial attention and semantic consistency-based scientific influence modeling. Spatial attention is employed in field topic representation which can selectively extract the attributes from the field topics to distinguish the importance of field topic attributes. Semantic consistency-based scientific influence modeling maps research topics of different fields to a unified semantic space to obtain the scientific influence context of other related fields. Extensive experiment results on five related research fields in the computer science (CS) discipline show that the proposed model is superior to the most advanced methods and achieves good topic prediction performance.","authors":["Mingying Xu","Junping Du","Zeli Guan","Zhe Xue"],"meta":["December 2021Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 2021(1):1-15","DOI:10.1155/2021/1766743"],"references":["353496049_Hybrid_LSTM_Self-Attention_Mechanism_Model_for_Forecasting_the_Reform_of_Scientific_Research_in_Morocco","344372269_Mapping_the_technology_evolution_path_a_novel_model_for_dynamic_topic_detection_and_tracking","339871937_Leveraging_citation_influences_for_Modeling_scientific_documents","338871124_Exploring_Technology_Evolution_Pathways_to_Facilitate_Technology_Management_From_a_Technology_Life_Cycle_Perspective","351237083_Combining_deep_neural_network_and_bibliometric_indicator_for_emerging_research_topic_prediction","347295233_Multi-Stage_Attention_Spatial-Temporal_Graph_Networks_for_Traffic_Prediction","344074499_Predicting_scientific_research_trends_based_on_link_prediction_in_keyword_networks","343755747_Predictions_for_COVID-19_with_deep_learning_models_of_LSTM_GRU_and_Bi-LSTM","341196178_Predicting_future_influence_of_papers_researchers_and_venues_in_a_dynamic_academic_network","340567373_A_Spatial-Temporal_Attention_Approach_for_Traffic_Prediction"]}
