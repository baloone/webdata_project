{"id":"337617518_Validation_of_a_Low-Cost_Electromyography_EMG_System_via_a_Commercial_and_Accurate_EMG_Device_Pilot_Study","abstract":"Electromyography (EMG) devices are well-suited for measuring the behaviour of muscles during an exercise or a task, and are widely used in many different research areas. Their disadvantage is that commercial systems are expensive. We designed a low-cost EMG system with enough accuracy and reliability to be used in a wide range of possible ways. The present article focuses on the validation of the low-cost system we designed, which is compared with a commercially available, accurate device. The evaluation was done by means of a set of experiments, in which volunteers performed isometric and dynamic exercises while EMG signals from the rectus femoris muscle were registered by both the proposed low-cost system and a commercial system simultaneously. Analysis and assessment of three indicators to estimate the similarity between both signals were developed. These indicated a very good result, with spearmanâ€™s correlation averaging above 0.60, the energy ratio close to the 80% and the linear correlation coefficient approximating 100%. The agreement between both systems (custom and commercial) is excellent, although there are also some limitations, such as the delay of the signal (<1 s) and noise due to the hardware and assembly in the proposed system.","authors":["Sergio Fuentes","Yuyang Wei","Ester Olmeda","Lei Ren"],"meta":["November 2019Sensors 19(23):5214","DOI:10.3390/s19235214"],"references":["334855844_Predict_Afferent_Tactile_Neural_Signal_for_Artificial_Nerve_Based_on_Finite_Element_Human_Hand_Model","334607817_Is_the_Use_of_a_Low-Cost_sEMG_Sensor_Valid_to_Measure_Muscle_Fatigue","331350505_Calibracion_Automatica_en_Filtros_Adaptativos_para_el_Procesamiento_de_Senales_EMG","329085830_Electromyography-controlled_car_A_proof_of_concept_based_on_surface_electromyography_Extreme_Learning_Machines_and_low-cost_open_hardware","327217823_Clutch_Pedal_Sensorization_and_Evaluation_of_the_Main_Parameters_Related_to_Driver_Posture","330748328_The_between-day_reliability_of_peroneus_longus_EMG_during_walking","329137283_Feasibility_of_an_optimal_EMG-driven_adaptive_impedance_control_applied_to_an_active_knee_orthosis","328406006_Association_between_double-leg_squat_and_single-leg_squat_performance_and_injury_incidence_among_incoming_NCAA_Division_I_athletes_A_prospective_cohort_study","325853928_Additional_Insight_Into_Biarticular_Muscle_Function_The_Influence_Of_Hip_Flexor_Fatigue_On_Rectus_Femoris_Activity_At_The_Knee","325536807_Low-cost_electromyography_-_Validation_against_a_commercial_system_using_both_manual_and_automated_activation_timing_thresholds"]}
