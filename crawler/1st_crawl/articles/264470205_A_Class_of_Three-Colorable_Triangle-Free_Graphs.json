{"id":"264470205_A_Class_of_Three-Colorable_Triangle-Free_Graphs","abstract":"The chromatic number of a triangle-free graph can be arbitrarily large. In this article, we show that if all subdivisions of K2, 3 are also excluded as induced subgraphs, then the chromatic number becomes bounded by 3. We give a structural characterization of this class of graphs, from which we derive an coloring algorithm, where n denotes the number of vertices and m the number of edges of the input graph.","authors":["Marko RadovanoviÄ‡","Kristina Vuskovic"],"meta":["April 2013Journal of Graph Theory 72(4)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.21651"],"references":["220397650_Vertex_Colouring_and_Forbidden_Subgraphs_-_A_Survey","284877584_Graph_theory_and_probability_II","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","267011832_Graph_Theory_and_Probability_II","242911013_Triangle-free_graphs_that_are_signable_without_even_holes","239059226_Alpha-balanced_graphs_and_matrices_and_GF3-representability_of_matroids","227700797_Even-hole-free_graphs_Part_I_Decomposition_Theorem","226657991_Induced_Subdivisions_In_K_ss-Free_Graphs_of_Large_Average_Degree","226087186_Graph_Theory_and_Probability","223118002_Decomposition_by_clique_separators","220442019_The_three-in-a-tree_problem","220441834_Universally_Signable_Graphs","220194186_On_the_NP-completeness_of_the_k-colorability_problem_for_triangle-free_graphs"]}
