{"id":"239921962_Listening_Skills_Development_Through_Multimedia","abstract":"As multimedia technology (interactive videodisc, CD-ROM, CD-I, etc.) becomes more accessible to teachers and learners of other languages, its potential as a tool to enhance listening skills becomes a practical option. Multimedia allows integration of text, graphics, audio, and motion video in a range of combinations. The result is that learners can now interact with textual, aural, and visual media in a wide range of formats. Consequently, when we now look at the computer as potentially supporting listening skills acquisition, we need to examine not only aural processing opportunities, but multi modal, (simultaneous sight, sound, text) processing as well. This paper examines multi modal processing and its implications for listening skills development in a foreign or second language. How multi modal processing as it relates to listening skills development can be supported by multimedia technology is presented.","authors":["Carla Meskill"],"meta":["November 1996Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia 5(2)"],"references":["292710752_A_direction_for_CALL_From_behavioristic_to_humanistic_courseware","270237469_Language_Two","318105978_Discourse_Analysis_for_Language_Teachers","313053902_Strategy_training_for_language_learners_Six_situational_case_studies_and_a_training_model","312894382_Input_and_interaction_in_the_communicative_langauge_classroom_A_comparison_of_teacher-fronted_and_group_activities","294695656_The_pleasure_hypothesis","288971227_Closed-captioned_TV_An_untapped_resource","286270523_The_effects_of_captioned_television_videotapes_on_the_listening_comprehension_of_beginning_intermediate_and_advanced_ESL_students","271783108_Using_News_Broadcasts_in_the_ESLEFL_Classroom","270236181_Video_in_Language_Teaching"]}
