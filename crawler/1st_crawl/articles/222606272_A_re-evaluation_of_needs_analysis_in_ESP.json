{"id":"222606272_A_re-evaluation_of_needs_analysis_in_ESP","abstract":"The value of needs analysis may go unrealized unless ambiguity and lack of precision in the use of the term are cleared away. It is necessary first to remove superfluous terminology, and second to establish different levels of needs, allotting some kind of priority between them. A solution is proposed under the rubric of target situation analysis. TSA goes into the target situations, collects and analyses data in order to establish the communication that really occursâ€”its functions, forms, and frequencies, and provides a basis for selecting the long-range aims of the course. Certain intermediate objectives will also be established prior to the course as a result of pedagogic considerations. Their number and delicacy will be controlled largely by constraints from all participants concerned in the design and implementation of the course. The programme is monitored while it is in progress to ensure that intermediate objectives are still relevant and attainable.","authors":["F.
