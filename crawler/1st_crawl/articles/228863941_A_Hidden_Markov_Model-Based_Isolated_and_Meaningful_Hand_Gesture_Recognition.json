{"id":"228863941_A_Hidden_Markov_Model-Based_Isolated_and_Meaningful_Hand_Gesture_Recognition","abstract":"Gesture recognition is a challenging task for extracting meaningful gesture from continuous hand motion. In this paper, we propose an automatic system that recognizes isolated gesture, in addition meaningful gesture from continuous hand motion for Arabic numbers from 0 to 9 in real-time based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In order to handle isolated gesture, HMM using Ergodic, Left-Right (LR) and Left-Right Banded (LRB) topologies is applied over the discrete vector feature that is extracted from stereo color image sequences. These topologies are considered to different number of states ranging from 3 to 10. A new system is developed to recognize the meaningful gesture based on zero-codeword detection with static velocity motion for continuous gesture. Therefore, the LRB topology in conjunction with Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm for training and forward algorithm with Viterbi path for testing presents the best performance. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully recognize isolated and meaningful gesture and achieve average rate recognition 98.6% and 94.29% respectively.","authors":["Mahmoud Elmezain","Ayoub Al-Hamadi","JÃ¶rg Appenrodt","Bernd Michaelis"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["228363421_Real-time_capable_system_for_hand_gesture_recognition_using_hidden_markov_models_in_stereo_color_image_sequence","224649170_A_Stereo_and_Color-based_Method_for_Face_Pose_Estimation_and_Facial_Feature_Extraction","221305411_Colour_Model_Selection_and_Adaption_in_Dynamic_Scenes","42803893_A_Novel_Method_for_3D_Face_Detection_and_Normalization","27382525_On_Feature_Extraction_and_Sign_Recognition_for_Greek_Sign_Language","220930850_A_Neural_Network_Approach_for_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_in_Virtual_Reality_Driving_Training_System_of_SPG","220604372_Hand_gesture_recognition_using_combined_features_of_location_angle_and_velocity","215721997_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_ans_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition","23608772_Mixture_Densities_Maximum_Likelihood_and_the_EM_Algorithm","4113091_Vision-based_skin-colour_segmentation_of_moving_HANDS_for_real-time_applications","4107926_Model_structure_selection_training_algorithms_for_an_HMM_gesture_recognition_system","2654868_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_for_Human_Skin_Color_and_Its_Applications_in_Image_and_Video_Databases","3970140_A_novel_skin_color_model_in_YCBCR_color_space_and_its_application_to_human_face_detection","3421786_Gesture_Recognition_A_Survey","3193040_An_HMM-Based_threshold_model_approach_for_gesture_recognition"]}
