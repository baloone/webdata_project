{"id":"225815206_Convergent_difference_schemes_for_nonlinear_parabolic_equations_and_mean_curvature_motion","abstract":"Explicit finite difference schemes are given for a collection of parabolic equations which may have all of the following complex\nfeatures: degeneracy, quasilinearity, full nonlinearity, and singularities. In particular, the equation of “motion by mean\ncurvature” is included. The schemes are monotone and consistent, so that convergence is guaranteed by the general theory of\napproximation of viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear problems. In addition, an intriguing new type of nonlocal problem\nis analyzed which is related to the schemes, and another very different sort of approximation is presented as well.","authors":["Michael G.
