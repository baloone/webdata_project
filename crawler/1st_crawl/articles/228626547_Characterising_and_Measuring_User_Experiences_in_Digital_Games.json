{"id":"228626547_Characterising_and_Measuring_User_Experiences_in_Digital_Games","abstract":"In this paper, we describe the challenge of adequately characterizing and measuring experiences associated with playing digital games. We discuss the applicability of traditional usability metrics to user-centred game design, and highlight two prominent concepts, flow and immersion, as potential candidates for evaluating gameplay. The paper concludes by describing the multi-measure approach taken by the Game Experience Research Lab in Eindhoven.","authors":["Wijnand A Ijsselsteijn","Yvonne De Kort","Karolien Poels","Audrius Jurgelionis"],"meta":["January 2007","Project: Psychology of Digital Games"],"references":["247190693_Hearts_clubs_diamonds_spades_Players_who_suit_MUDs","234820600_User-Centered_Design_in_Games","221217389_Fundamental_Components_of_the_Gameplay_Experience_Analysing_Immersion","220982408_Using_frustration_in_the_design_of_adaptive_videogames","220851467_Enjoyment_and_Entertainment_in_East_and_West","270120441_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","234817885_Mind_at_Play_The_Psychology_of_Video_Games","221518196_Affective_gaming_measuring_emotion_through_the_gamepad","221515445_A_grounded_investigation_of_game_immersion","220686347_GameFlow_A_Model_for_Evaluating_Player_Enjoyment_in_Games"]}
