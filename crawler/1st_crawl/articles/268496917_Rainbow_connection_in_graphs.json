{"id":"268496917_Rainbow_connection_in_graphs","abstract":"Let G be a nontrivial connected graph on which an edge coloring cE(G)→{1,2,⋯,k}, k∈ℕ, is defined, where adjacent edges may be colored with the same color. A path P in G is a rainbow path if no two edges of P are colored the same. The graph G is rainbow-connected if G contains a rainbow u-v path for every two vertices u and v of G. The minimum k for which there exists such a k-edge coloring is the rainbow connection number rc(G) of G. If for every pair u,v of distinct vertices, G contains a rainbow u-v geodesic, then G is strongly rainbow-connected. The minimum k for which there exists a k-edge coloring of G that results in a strongly rainbow-connected graph is called the strong rainbow connection number src(G) of G. Thus rc(G)≤src(G) for every nontrivial connected graph G. Both rc(G) and src(G) are determined for all complete multipartite graphs G as well as other classes of graphs. For every pair a,b of integers with a≥3 and b≥(5a-6)/3, it is shown that there exists a connected graph G such that rc(G)=a and src(G)=b.","authors":["Gary Chartrand","Garry Johns","Kathleen A.
