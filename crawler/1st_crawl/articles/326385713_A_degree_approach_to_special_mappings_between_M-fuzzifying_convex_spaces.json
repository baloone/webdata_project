{"id":"326385713_A_degree_approach_to_special_mappings_between_M-fuzzifying_convex_spaces","abstract":"Based on a frame M, each mapping between M-fuzzifying convex spaces is equipped with some degree to be a CP mapping, a CC mapping, an isomorphic mapping and a quotient mapping. In this sense, the M-CP degree, the M-CC degree, the M-isomorphic degree and the M-quotient degree of mappings between M-fuzzifying convex spaces are obtained and investigated. It is shown that the M-CP degree and the M-CC degree can be characterized by hull operators of M-fuzzifying convex spaces. Moreover, it is proved that there are compatible relations among the M-CP degree, the M-CC degree, the M-isomorphic degree and the M-quotient degree by using some equalities and inequalities.","authors":["Zhen-Yu Xiu","Bin Pang"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 35(20):1-12","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-171046","Project: Fuzzy convex structures and fuzzy matroids"],"references":["324598495_Base_axioms_and_Subbase_axioms_in_M-fuzzifying_convex_spaces","323915495_M-FUZZIFYING_INTERVAL_SPACES","323113264_Degrees_of_separation_properties_in_stratified_L-generalized_convergence_spaces_using_residual_implication","321452886_The_relationship_between_L-subuniverses_and_L-convexities","319677126_A_new_definition_of_order_relation_for_the_introduction_of_algebraic_fuzzy_closure_operators","318437530_Formulations_of_L-convex_hulls_on_some_algebraic_structures","325382299_Fuzzy_counterparts_of_hull_operators_and_interval_operators_in_the_framework_of_L_-convex_spaces","323368290_Strong_inclusion_orders_between_L_-subsets_and_its_applications_in_L_-convex_spaces","322610907_A_new_approach_to_the_fuzzification_of_arity_JHC_and_CUP_of_L-convexities","318667575_Lattice-Valued_Interval_Operators_and_Its_Induced_Lattice-Valued_Convex_Structures"]}
