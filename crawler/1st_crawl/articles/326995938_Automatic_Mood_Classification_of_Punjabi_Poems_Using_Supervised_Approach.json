{"id":"326995938_Automatic_Mood_Classification_of_Punjabi_Poems_Using_Supervised_Approach","abstract":"In computer science, NLP is the approach for intercommunication between human language (Natural Language) and computers. NLP is generally used in text classification. Human often wants to read poems that fit according to his/her current mood. There are many types of poems according to mood like happy/joy, sad, reflective, surprise and anticipation etc. This paper discusses a technique for automatically classifying varied types of poems according to mood. Three types of mood viz happy/joy, sad and anticipation are selected. The proposed method classifies poems based on features that are associated with the mood of poems. Many types of features like tf, tf-idf, POS-tags and word features etc. are considered. As for comparison identical dataset is classified using Maximum Entropy and Naive Bayes classifiers.","authors":["Gurpreet Josan","Shabnam Bawa"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["284326319_Emotion_Classification_in_Arabic_Poetry_Using_Machine_Learning","280733696_An_Exploration_of_Mood_Classification_in_the_Million_Songs_Dataset","269670995_Multi-Class_Twitter_Emotion_Classification_A_New_Approach","257482099_Mood_sensing_from_social_media_texts_and_its_applications","305845486_The_Role_of_Emotions_for_the_Perceived_Usefulness_in_Online_Customer_Reviews","282985317_Exploring_user_emotion_in_microblogs_for_music_recommendation","282562385_Hierarchical_Emotion_Classification_and_Emotion_Component_Analysis_on_Chinese_Micro-Blog_Posts","282535945_Performance_analysis_of_Ensemble_methods_on_Twitter_sentiment_analysis_using_NLP_techniques","261480280_Music_Mood_Classification_Using_Intro_and_Refrain_Parts_of_Lyrics","261052828_Domain_Specific_Sentence_Level_Mood_Extraction_from_Malayalam_Text"]}
