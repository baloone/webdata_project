{"id":"267168963_Positive_Definite_Matrices","abstract":"This book represents the first synthesis of the considerable body of new research into positive definite matrices. These matrices play the same role in noncommutative analysis as positive real numbers do in classical analysis. They have theoretical and computational uses across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including calculus, electrical engineering, statistics, physics, numerical analysis, quantum information theory, and geometry. Through detailed explanations and an authoritative and inspiring writing style, Rajendra Bhatia carefully develops general techniques that have wide applications in the study of such matrices. Written by an expert in the area, the book presents in an accessible manner a lot of important results from the realm of positive matrices and of their applications..The book can be used for graduate courses in linear algebra, or as supplementary material for courses in operator theory, and as a reference book by engineers and researchers working in the applied field of quantum information.","authors":["Rajendra Bhatia"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["279205002_Comparing_a_Matrix_to_its_Off-Diagonal_Part","266171245_Cauchy-Schwarz_and_means_inequalities_for_elementary_operators_into_norm_ideals","229284005_Cauchy-Schwarz_norm_inequalities_for_weak-integrals_of_operator_valued_functions","225987772_Norm_Inequalities_for_Positive_Operators","268908694_Groupes_simples_clos_et_ouverts_et_geometrie_riemannienne","268769528_Formulas_of_differentiation_according_to_a_parameter_of_functions_of_Hermitian_operators","267660779_Pinching_Trimming_Truncating_and_Averaging_of_Matrices","266279152_Log-majorizations_and_norm_inequalities_for_exponential_operators","266010540_Noncommutative_geometric_means","266007976_Structure_of_operators_with_numerical_radius_one","265947998_The_Hadamard_product","265464069_A_Better_Bound_on_the_Variance","264961989_Fonctions_operant_sur_les_fonctions_definies-positive","260222984_Some_Comments_on_Several_Matrix_Inequalities_with_Applications_to_Canonical_Correlations_Historical_Background_and_Recent_Developments","257828230_A_note_on_More_Operator_Versions_of_the_Schwarz_Inequality","253826970_On_the_Representation_of_TreA-lambdaB_as_a_Laplace_Transform","251200810_Positive_linear_maps_of_C-algebras","248755414_Non_-_Linear_Completely_Positive_Maps","246998479_On_Boundary_Values_of_a_Schlicht_Mapping","246981291_Notions_generalizing_convexity_for_functions_defined_on_spaces_of_matrices","243105148_Frechet_derivatives_of_the_power_function","243015036_Some_Operator_Inequalities_of_the_Schwarz_Type","242986344_A_matrix_version_of_the_Wielandt_Inequality_and_its_applications_to_statistics","242986293_Derivations_derivatives_and_chain_rules","242984560_A_noncommutative_analogue_of_DXkkXk-1","239537218_Innitely_Divisible_Matrices","238871799_Notes_towards_the_construction_of_nonlinear_relativistic_quantum_fields_III_Properties_of_the_C-dynamics_for_a_certain_class_of_interactions","231900161_Inequalities_between_means_of_positive_operators","229362381_Variation_of_induced_linear_operators","229218429_Variation_of_symmetric_tensor_powers_and_permanents","229198735_On_the_definiteness_of_the_solutions_of_certain_matrix_equations","226372899_On_some_operator_inequalities","226354421_Differentiation_of_Operator_Functions_and_Perturbation_Bounds","226264255_More_Operator_Versions_of_the_Schwarz_Inequality","223116729_A_new_positive_definite_geometric_mean_of_two_positive_definite_matrices","222843941_First_and_second_order_perturbation_bounds_for_the_operator_absolute_value","222770356_Norm_bounds_for_Hadamard_products_and_an_arithmetic_-_geometric_mean_inequality_for_unitarily_invariant_norms","222762515_The_Golden-Thompson_trace_inequality_is_complemented","222610702_Interpolating_the_arithmetic-geometric_mean_inequality_and_its_operator_version","222606965_Variation_of_Grassman_powers_and_spectra","222472438_An_arithmetic-geometric-harmonic_mean_inequality_involving_Hadamard_products","222391088_Some_results_on_matrix_monotone_functions","222196801_Induced_norms_of_the_Schur_multiplier_operator","222120731_Geometric_Operator_Inequalities","222063906_Comparison_of_Various_Means_for_Operators","220656934_Generalized_Lyapunov_Equations_and_Positive_Definite_Functions","220656754_Means_of_Positive_Numbers_and_Matrices","38334979_Partitioned_Hermitian_matrices","38334841_Transformations_on_partitioned_matrices","38324027_Numerical_radii_of_zero-one_matrices","2470670_A_Guide_To_Entropy_And_The_Second_Law_Of_Thermodynamics","2123821_Eigenvalues_of_Words_in_Two_Positive_Definite_Letters"]}
