{"id":"221522963_Three_Automated_Stock-Trading_Agents_A_Comparative_Study","abstract":"This paper documents the development of three autonomous stock- trading agents within the framework of the Penn Exchange Simulator (PXS), a novel stock-trading simulator that takes advantage of electronic crossing net- works to realistically mix agent bids with bids from the real stock market (1). The three approaches presented take inspiration from reinforcement learning, myopic trading using regression-based price prediction, and market making. These ap- proaches are fully implemented and tested with results reported here, including individual evaluations using a fixed opponent strategy and a comparative analysis of the strategies in a joint simulation. The market-making strategy described in this paper was the winner in the fall 2003 PLAT live competition and the runner- up in the spring 2004 live competition, exhibiting consistent profitability. The strategy's performance in the live competitions is presented and analyzed.","authors":["Alexander A.
