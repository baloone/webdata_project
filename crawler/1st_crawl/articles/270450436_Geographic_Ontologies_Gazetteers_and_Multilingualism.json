{"id":"270450436_Geographic_Ontologies_Gazetteers_and_Multilingualism","abstract":"Different languages imply different visions of space, so that terminologies are different in geographic ontologies. In addition to their geometric shapes, geographic features have names, sometimes different in diverse languages. In addition, the role of gazetteers, as dictionaries of place names (toponyms), is to maintain relations between place names and location. The scope of geographic information retrieval is to search for geographic information not against a database, but against the whole Internet: but the Internet stores information in different languages, and it is of paramount importance not to remain stuck to a unique language. In this paper, our first step is to clarify the links between geographic objects as computer representations of geographic features, ontologies and gazetteers designed in various languages. Then, we propose some inference rules for matching not only types, but also relations in geographic ontologies with the assistance of gazetteers","authors":["Robert Laurini"],"meta":["March 2015Future Internet 7(1):1-23","DOI:10.3390/fi7010001"],"references":["278679095_Urban_Ontologies_for_an_improved_communication_in_urban_civil_engineering_projects","276959705_Point_Set_Topological_Spatial_Relations","266532933_Spatial_Intelligence_and_Toponyms","265109603_Importance_of_spatial_relationships_for_geographic_ontologies","225608629_Pre-consensus_Ontologies_and_Urban_Databases","285158664_A_Translation_Approach_to_Formal_Ontologies","262355566_A_configurable_translation-based_cross-lingual_ontology_mapping_system_to_adjust_mapping_outcomes","259141495_A_conceptual_framework_for_geographic_knowledge_engineering","241008809_Place_Names_Ontologies","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies"]}
