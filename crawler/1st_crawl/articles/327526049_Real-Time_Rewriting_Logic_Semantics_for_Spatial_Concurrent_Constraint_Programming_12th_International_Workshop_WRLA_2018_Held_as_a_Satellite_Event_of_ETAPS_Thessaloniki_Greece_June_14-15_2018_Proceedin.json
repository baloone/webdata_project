This paper uses rewriting logic for specifying and analyzing a process calculus for concurrent constraint programming (\\(\\textsf {ccp}\\)), combining spatial and real-time behavior. In these systems, agents can run processes in different computational spaces (e.g., containers) while subject to real-time requirements (e.g., upper bounds in the execution time of a given operation), which can be specified with both discrete and dense linear time. The real-time rewriting logic semantics is fully executable in Maude with the help of rewriting modulo SMT: partial information (i.e., constraints) in the specification is represented by quantifier-free formulas on the shared variables of the system that are under the control of SMT decision procedures. The approach is used to symbolically analyze existential real-time reachability properties of process calculi in the presence of spatial hierarchies for sharing information and knowledge.","authors":["Sergio Ram√≠rez","Miguel Romero","Camilo Rocha","Frank Valencia"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-99840-4_13","In book: Rewriting Logic and Its Applications (pp.226-244)"],"references":["267465825_Spatial_and_Epistemic_Modalities_in_Constraint-Based_Process_Calculi","263504129_Stochastic_modelling_of_non-Markovian_dynamics_in_biochemical_reactions","242074582_Real-Time_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","228567340_Two_case_studies_of_semantics_execution_in_maude_CCS_and_LOTOS","220997945_Semantic_Foundations_of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220997522_Stochastic_Processes_as_Concurrent_Constraint_Programs","220985886_Non-determinism_and_Probabilities_in_Timed_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220985854_Stochastic_Behavior_and_Explicit_Discrete_Time_in_Concurrent_Constraint_Programmin","220370919_Abstraction_and_Completeness_for_Real-Time_Maude","3561051_Foundations_of_timed_concurrent_constraint_programming","2561833_Temporal_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Denotation_Logic_And_Applications","2357676_Default_Timed_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","323686795_Symbolic_Execution_and_Reachability_Analysis_Using_Rewriting_Modulo_SMT_for_Spatial_Concurrent_Constraint_Systems_with_Extrusion","321878262_All_About_Maude_-_A_High-Performance_Logical_Framework_How_to_Specify_Program_and_Verify_Systems_in_Rewriting_Logic","309184065_Rewriting_modulo_SMT_and_open_system_analysis","308129937_Belief_Knowledge_Lies_and_Other_Utterances_in_an_Algebra_for_Space_and_Extrusion","300576499_Yices_22","225175493_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_with_Process_Mobility","225164309_The_Rewriting_Logic_Semantics_Project_A_Progress_Report","223627899_Semantic_foundations_for_generalized_rewrite_theories","222684443_A_causal_semantics_for_CCS_via_rewriting_logic","222512822_Specification_of_Real-Time_and_Hybrid_Systems_in_Rewriting_Logic","222459436_Conditioned_Rewriting_Logic_as_a_United_Model_of_Concurrency","221403006_CVC4","220248120_A_Timed_Concurrent_Constraint_Language","220130881_Computing_with_Continuous_Change","49401646_Concurrent_constraint_programming_with_process_mobility","36013217_Purely_Functional_Data_Structures"]}
