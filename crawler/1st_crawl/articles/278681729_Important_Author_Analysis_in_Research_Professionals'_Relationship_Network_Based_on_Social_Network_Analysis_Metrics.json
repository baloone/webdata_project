{"id":"278681729_Important_Author_Analysis_in_Research_Professionals'_Relationship_Network_Based_on_Social_Network_Analysis_Metrics","abstract":"Important author analysis is one of the key issues in the research professionals’ relationship network. Research professionals’ relationship network is a type of social network which is constitute of research professionals and there co-author relationship with other professionals. So many social network analysis metrics are available to analyze the important or prominent actor in the network. Centrality in social network analysis represents prestige or importance of a node with respect to other nodes in the network and also represents the importance of relationship between nodes. In this paper, we studied social network theory to understand how the collaboration of research professionals has impact in research world and performance of individual researcher. For this analysis, we use social network analysis metrics like normalize degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality.","authors":["Manoj Kumar Pandia","Anand Bihari"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-81-322-2202-6_16","In book: Computational Intelligence in Data Mining - Volume 3 (pp.185-194)","Project: Researcher's Scientific Assessment"],"references":["284236341_Centrality_and_AIDS","323161501_Linear_Algebra_in_Geography_Eigenvectors_of_Networks","311906750_Mathematics_of_Networks","310829687_Automatic_Co-authorship_Network_Extraction_and_Discovery_of_Central_Authors","309905002_A_critical_review_of_centrality_measures_in_social_networks","288347808_Linear_algebra_in_geography_Eigenvectors_of_networks","266012007_Linear_Algebra_in_Geography_Eigenvectors_of_Networks","265179678_Justification_and_Application_of_Eigenvector_Centrality","264596467_Monitoring_social_centrality_for_peer-to-peer_network_protection","260353705_Multi-index_evaluation_algorithm_based_on_principal_component_analysis_for_node_importance_in_complex_networks"]}
