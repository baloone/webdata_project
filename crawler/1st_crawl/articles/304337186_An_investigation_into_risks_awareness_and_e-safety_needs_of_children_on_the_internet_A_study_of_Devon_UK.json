{"id":"304337186_An_investigation_into_risks_awareness_and_e-safety_needs_of_children_on_the_internet_A_study_of_Devon_UK","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThis paper aims to investigate children interaction in cyberspace and their use of Web 2.0 technologies. It sought their perception of internet risks as well as their knowledge and experience with electronic safety (e-safety) measures. It also considered parents’, teachers’ and other stakeholders’ perception of internet risks, e-safety procedures and children’s practices while online.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe research adopted a mixed method approach which involved the use of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The results were presented and analysed using descriptive statistics, while the interviews utilised coding and data structuring.\n\nFindings\n\nThis research highlighted that e-safety policies and procedures have not kept up to date with technological advances. Children were also developing an online presence, and because it was considered normative behaviour, they were not always cautious. Consequently, society was reactive when dealing with the internet risk issues. Hence, more resources were needed to educate parents and children on safe practices on the internet.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nThis is an exploratory study and further research should be conducted for broader generalisations.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThe paper makes a number of practical recommendations for education providers and parents to raise awareness of internet risks and e-safety initiatives.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThis paper further extends the body of theory on e-safety and provides new insights into the risks exposure of children on the internet. It also highlights the limitations of e-safety initiatives.","authors":["Fenio Annansingh","Thomas Veli"],"meta":["June 2016Interactive Technology and Smart Education 13(2):147-165","DOI:10.1108/ITSE-09-2015-0029"],"references":["273518355_How_and_Why_Parents_Guide_the_Media_Use_of_Young_Children","257545265_Does_It_Matter_What_Mama_Says_Evaluating_the_Role_of_Parental_Mediation_in_European_Adolescents'_Excessive_Internet_Use","242340758_Cyber-Bullying_and_Schools_in_an_Electronic_Era","227605328_E-safety_and_Web_20_for_children_aged_11-16","349137305_Illicit_Drugs_Use_and_Control","278795569_Cyberbullying_Review_of_an_Old_Problem_Gone_Viral","278322111_Online_Addictions","272753609_Online_safety_begins_with_you_and_me_Convincing_Internet_users_to_protect_themselves","254220699_User_preference_of_cyber_security_awareness_delivery_methods","249803060_Computer_Mediated_Communication_and_Student_Learning_in_Large_Introductory_Sociology_Classes","220553711_Establishing_A_Personalized_Information_Security_Culture","220373322_Exploring_barriers_to_effective_e-learning_Case_study_of_DNPA","220208396_Mobile_phones_and_the_evolution_of_social_behavior","38177620_Protecting_vulnerable_young_people_in_cyberspace_from_sexual_abuse_raising_awareness_and_responding_globally","20374038_Method_Triangulation_to_Index_Change_in_Clinical_Phenomena","19494703_Methodological_Triangulation_A_Vehicle_for_Merging_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research_Methods"]}
