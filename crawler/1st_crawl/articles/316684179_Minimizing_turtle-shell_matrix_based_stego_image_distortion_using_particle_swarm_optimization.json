{"id":"316684179_Minimizing_turtle-shell_matrix_based_stego_image_distortion_using_particle_swarm_optimization","abstract":"The purpose of data hiding is to embed secret messages into cover media so that the receiver will not be aware of the existence of these important messages. Recently, Chang et al. proposed a novel data hiding scheme based on turtle shells, which provided a good visual quality and an acceptable embedding capacity. However, the matrix that is used in the scheme based on turtle shells is not an optimal matrix. This means that the distortion of the image can be reduced further. In this paper, we propose a method that uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) to further reduce the distortion of the cover image based on turtle shells. Our experimental results confirmed that our scheme was efficient in finding an optimal replacement table and achieved a better visual quality of the cover image. Also, our scheme enhanced the security of scheme based on the turtle-shell matrix.","authors":["Q. Jin","Z. Li","C.-C. Chang","A.
