{"id":"320933499_CITE_-_Content_Interaction_Time_and_spacE_a_hybrid_approach_to_model_man-robot_interaction_for_deployment_in_museums","abstract":"In this paper, we present a generic model, CITE (Content-Interaction-Time-spacE) devoted to the development of interactive applications for places of culture such as museums or theaters. The idea is to introduce new kinds of interactions with visitors while preserving the quality of the information they can acquire into the museum. We first present two previous works involving respectively a bottom-up model (LINK H/R) in the context of science-art interaction, and a top-down model (PLUG) which was an interactive game in a museum. The CITE model is then presented as a trade-off between those approaches: details are given concerning the Content and Interaction management; and an extension is considered concerning Time and spacE handling.","authors":["Armelle Prigent","Arnaud Revel"],"meta":["November 2017EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies 4(13):153336","DOI:10.4108/eai.8-11-2017.153336","Projects: CELTIC/EDAIN : a framework for dynamic adaptation of interactionInteractive storytelling with formal methods"],"references":["223148537_PerAc_A_neural_architecture_to_control_artificial_animals","3412138_Learning_and_communication_via_imitation_An_autonomous_robot_perspective","243679158_Autopoiesis_the_organization_of_living_systems","221343325_Hierarchical_Correctness_Proofs_for_Distributed_Algorithms","216722136_Behavior-Based_Robotics","3113805_Outline_for_a_theory_of_intelligence"]}
