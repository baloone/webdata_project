{"id":"350101766_On_CCZ-inequivalence_of_some_families_of_almost_perfect_nonlinear_functions_to_permutations","abstract":"Browning et al. (2010) exhibited almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutations on \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^{6}}\\). This was the first example of an APN permutation on an even degree extension of \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2}\\). In their approach of finding an APN permutation, Browning et al. made use of a necessary and sufficient condition based on the Walsh transform. In this paper, we give an algorithm based on a related necessary condition which checks whether a vectorial Boolean function is CCZ-inequivalent to a permutation. Using this algorithm, we are able to show that no function belonging to a known family of APN functions is equivalent to a permutation on \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^{2m}}\\), where m ≤ 6 (except for the known case on \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^{6}}\\)). We also give an EA-invariant based on the condition. Finally, we give a theoretical proof of the fact that no member of a specific family of APN functions is equivalent to a permutation on doubly-even degree extensions of \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2}\\).","authors":["Faruk Göloğlu","Jiří Pavlu"],"meta":["May 2021Cryptography and Communications 13(3)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-021-00476-0"],"references":["342144465_On_equivalence_between_known_families_of_quadratic_APN_functions","330106902_On_some_quadratic_APN_functions","284787949_A_note_on_APN_permutations_in_even_dimension","342863988_Almost_perfect_nonlinear_families_which_are_not_equivalent_to_permutations","342731643_A_new_family_of_APN_quadrinomials","340241912_On_the_Distance_Between_APN_Functions","331627957_Vectorial_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography","314292343_Some_Results_on_the_Known_Classes_of_Quadratic_APN_Functions","313472629_Differentially_uniform_mappings_for_cryptography","265815787_An_APN_permutation_in_dimension_six","265438233_APN_polynomials_and_related_codes","246143876_Explicit_evaluation_of_certain_exponential_sums","245265198_Almost_Perfect_Nonlinear_Power_Functions_on_GF2_n_A_New_Case_for_n_Divisible_by_5","234801055_Affinity_of_permutations_of_F2n","226537778_Equivalences_of_quadratic_APN_functions"]}
