{"id":"312484686_An_Experience_Report_of_Flipped_Classroom_Strategy_Implementation_for_Java_Programming_Course","abstract":"Graduate engineering students with lifelong learning skill can be achieved using flipped classroom strategy. Flipped classroom is one of the active learning strategy in which class time is used for problem-solving, application building, activities and to give more attain to individual student understanding whereas out-of-class time used for content delivery through video lecture. This paper presents an experiment conducted using flipped classroom strategy to teach Java programming course to sixty students of Third year Information Technology. The objective of this work is to study how effectively we can use flipped classroom strategy to teach Java programming concepts. In this paper, information about experimental methodology, students' experience about the flipped classroom activities and effectiveness of these activities in terms of result are presented.","authors":["Trupti Indi"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/T4E.2016.059","Conference: 2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)"],"references":["283096704_Flipped_Classroom_Strategies_for_CS_Education","276427778_A_Study_of_the_Flipped_Classroom_and_Its_Effectiveness_in_Flipping_Thirty_Percent_of_the_Course_Content","308824697_Collaborative_Learning_in_Computer_Programming_Courses_That_Adopted_the_Flipped_Classroom","300482573_Flipped_Classroom_Model_Based_Instruction_of_College_English_in_ICT_Environment","283340077_The_Study_of_Mobile_Teaching_System_Based_on_Micro-Lecture_JAVA_Flipped_Classroom_for_Example"]}
