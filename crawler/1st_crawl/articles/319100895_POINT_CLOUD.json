{"id":"319100895_POINT_CLOUD","abstract":"In the area of computer science, a densely packed collection of data points is not referred to as a cluster as it is in mathematics, but, it is commonly referred to as a point cloud. Point clouds are typically computer processed as a series of two or three dimensional maticies. Depending on the size of the matrix will determine the amount of time that the computer will require to solve the matrix. Typically, the number of seconds that are required to computer a matrix final value is the factorial of the total number of elements in the matrix (each element in the matrix is another data point value). In the case of the three dimensional matrix, the number of seconds required by the computer to tabulate the final value of the matrix is the factorial of the first matrix times the factorial times the level of nesting of the matricies.","authors":["Marco Bitetto"],"meta":["August 2017","Project: UNIVERSITY ENGINEERING EDUCATION PRESENTATION"],"references":[]}
