{"id":"321012982_On_graphs_with_largest_possible_game_domination_number","abstract":"Let γ(G)γ(G) and γg(G)γg(G) be the domination number and the game domination number of a graph GG, respectively. In this paper γgγg-maximal graphs are introduced as the graphs GG for which γg(G)=2γ(G)−1γg(G)=2γ(G)−1 holds. Large families of γgγg-maximal graphs are constructed among the graphs in which their sets of support vertices are minimum dominating sets. γgγg-maximal graphs are also characterized among the starlike trees, that is, trees which have exactly one vertex of degree at least 33.","authors":["Kexiang Xu","Xia Li","Sandi Klavzar"],"meta":["November 2017Discrete Mathematics 341(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2017.10.024","Project: NNSF of China (No. 11671202)"],"references":["327064771_Domination_game_on_paths_and_cycles","309751325_Domination_game_extremal_families_for_35-conjecture_for_forests","303739608_How_Long_Can_One_Bluff_in_the_Domination_Game","301841216_The_Domination_Game_Proving_the_35_Conjecture_on_Isolate-Free_Forests","293645980_On_graphs_with_small_game_domination_number","285575603_Total_Version_of_the_Domination_Game","283240760_Domination_Game_Critical_Graphs","277702528_Characterisation_of_forests_with_trivial_game_domination_numbers","268525302_The_Disjoint_Domination_Game","265855385_The_domination_game_played_on_unions_of_graphs","263545410_On_the_Game_Domination_Number_of_Graphs_with_Given_Minimum_Degree","261439505_Domination_game_on_forests","220533327_Domination_Game_and_an_Imagination_Strategy","308030937_Trees_with_Equal_Total_Domination_and_Game_Total_Domination_Numbers","301312391_The_45_upper_bound_on_the_game_total_domination_number","289541710_Domination_Game_A_proof_of_the_35-Conjecture_for_Graphs_with_Minimum_Degree_at_Least_Two","282402711_Complexity_of_the_Game_Domination_Problem","280033979_The_35-conjecture_for_weakly_SK_13-free_forests","264919524_Extremal_Problems_for_Game_Domination_Number","257586218_Realizations_of_the_game_domination_number","257000879_Domination_game_Extremal_families_of_graphs_for_3535-conjectures","231513001_Domination_game_played_on_trees_and_spanning_subgraphs"]}
