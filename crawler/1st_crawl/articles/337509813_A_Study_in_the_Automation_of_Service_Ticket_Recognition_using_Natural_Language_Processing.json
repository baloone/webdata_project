{"id":"337509813_A_Study_in_the_Automation_of_Service_Ticket_Recognition_using_Natural_Language_Processing","abstract":"In this paper we propose an approach for classifying\ndocuments, embedding documents into feature vectors and using\nthese embeddings for finding similarities between them. Our\nchosen domain for applying this method is the IT-Service Support\nbranch, where the documents we try to analyse are support\ntickets and the potential of classifying and finding patterns\nbetween tickets is huge for optimizing the service process. We aim\nto tackle the problem with multiple methods of text classification\nand recognition, and data analysis, followed by comparison and\ninterpretation of the results. Following our previous work in this\nfield, we propose further means of validating our models, so we\ncan describe and visualize several methods of feature extraction\nand recognition for service tickets that help the business process\nfor Service Support.","authors":["Matei Cristian","Sacarea Christian","Tolciu Tudor"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903676","Conference: 2019 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)"],"references":["284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","345392789_Affective_Computing","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","308797129_Distributional_structure","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267438295_Artificial_Neural_Networks","232591129_Distributional_Structure","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors"]}
