{"id":"317402628_Graphene-based_Patch_Antenna_Tunable_in_the_Three_Atmospheric_Windows","abstract":"A graphene microstrip patch antenna is designed to operate in the three bands of the atmospheric windows promising for the future wireless communications. The graphene has a reconfigurable surface conductivity that can be tuned to operate at the desired frequencies. This paper studies the role of chemical potential (μc) of the graphene to tune the resonant frequency of a microstrip antenna. The results show that the resonant frequency of a microstrip antenna increases as the chemical potential grows that can be employed to realize a reconfigurable antenna. The proposed resonances for the low-loss 300 GHz, 350 GHz and 410 GHz atmospheric windows can be achieved for μc = 0.21 eV, μc = 0.4 eV and μc = 1.5 eV respectively. Finally, a design process for a multi-band graphene-based antenna has been presented.","authors":["Amir Hossein Kazemi","Arash Mokhtari"],"meta":["June 2017Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics 142","DOI:10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.05.113","Project: Graphene Patch Antenna"],"references":["281628253_Equivalent_Circuit_with_Frequency-Independent_Lumped_Elements_for_Plasmonic_Graphene_Patch_Antenna_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Technique","276497219_Electromagnetic_Analysis_of_Graphene_Nanoparticles_Operating_in_the_TeraHertz_Band","259479780_Terahertz_Planar_Antennas_for_Next_Generation_Communication","255716239_Graphene_for_Terahertz_Applications","233928692_Graphene_Synthesis_and_Applications_in_Electronics_and_Photonics","224455422_Dyadic_Green's_Functions_and_Guided_Surface_Waves_for_a_Surface_Conductivity_Model_of_Graphene","51618549_Graphene_plasmonics_for_tunable_terahertz_metamaterials","1859443_Graphene_Carbon_in_Two_Dimensions","274264695_Analysis_of_graphene_based_optically_transparent_patch_antenna_for_terahertz_communications","266628407_Graphene_for_displays_that_bend","260313624_Terahertz_band_Next_frontier_for_wireless_communications","258433128_Antenna_Theory_Analysis_and_Design","226732553_A_Review_on_Terahertz_Communications_Research"]}
