{"id":"230609257_Link_Scheduling_for_Throughput_Maximization_in_Multihop_Wireless_Networks_Under_Physical_Interference","abstract":"We consider the problem of link scheduling for throughput maximization in\nmultihop wireless networks. Majority of previous methods are restricted to\ngraph-based interference models. In this paper we study the link scheduling\nproblem using a more realistic physical interference model. Through some key\nobservations about this model, we develop efficient link scheduling algorithms\nby exploiting the intrinsic connections between the physical interference model\nand the graph-based interference model. For one variant of the problem where\neach node can dynamically adjust its transmission power, we design a scheduling\nmethod with O(g(E)) approximation to the optimal throughput capacity where g(E)\ndenotes length diversity. For the other variant where each node has a fixed but\npossible different transmission powers for different nodes, we design a method\nwith O(g(E))-approximation ratio when the transmission powers of all nodes are\nwithin a constant factor of each other, and in general with an approximation\nratio of O(g(E)log\\rho) where log\\rho is power diversity.\nWe further prove that our algorithm for fixed transmission power case retains\nO(g(E)) approximation for any length-monotone, sub-linear fixed power setting.\nFurthermore, all these approximation factors are independent of network size.","authors":["Yaqin Zhou","Xiang-Yang Li","Min Liu","Zhongcheng Li"],"meta":["November 2017Wireless Networks 23(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11276-016-1276-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272521897_The_Price_of_Local_Power_Control_in_Wireless_Scheduling","261127319_A_fully_distributed_algorithm_for_throughput_performance_in_wireless_networks","311702569_Stability_properties_of_constrained_queueing_systems_and_scheduling_policies_for_maximum_throughput_in_multihop_radio_networks","307767637_On_the_Complexity_of_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networks","267804376_Distributed_Link_Scheduling_under_the_Physical_Interference_Model","262236697_Low-complexity_scheduling_for_wireless_networks","262234061_Brief_Announcement_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Link_Scheduling_in_the_Physical_Interference_Model","260636611_Scalable_Channel_Allocation_and_Access_Scheduling_for_Wireless_Internet-of-Things","257674503_Joint_multi-radio_multi-channel_assignment_scheduling_and_routing_in_wireless_mesh_networks","254031916_Distributed_link_scheduling_for_throughput_maximization_under_physical_interference_model","248088223_Throughput_and_fairness_guar-antees_through_maximal_scheduling_in_multihop_wireless_networks","232252940_Wireless_Network_Stability_in_the_SINR_Model","247900448_The_impact_of_imperfect_schedulin_g_on_cross-layer_rate_control_in_multihop_wireless_networks","234828217_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Link_Scheduling_With_SINR-Based_Interference","234412529_Throughput_Optimizing_Localized_Link_Scheduling_for_Multihop_WirelessNetworks_Under_Physical_Interference_Model"]}
