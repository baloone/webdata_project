{"id":"295375264_StaRVOOrS_A_Tool_for_Combined_Static_and_Runtime_Verification_of_Java","abstract":"We present the tool StaRVOOrS (Static and Runtime Verification of Object-Oriented Software), which combines static and runtime verification (RV) of Java programs. The tool automates a framework which uses partial results extracted from static verification to optimise the runtime monitoring process. StaRVOOrs combines the deductive theorem prover KeY and the RV tool LARVA, and uses properties written using the ppDATE specification language which combines the control-flow property language DATE used in LARVA with Hoare triples assigned to states.","authors":["Jesus Mauricio Chimento","Wolfgang Ahrendt","Gordon J.
