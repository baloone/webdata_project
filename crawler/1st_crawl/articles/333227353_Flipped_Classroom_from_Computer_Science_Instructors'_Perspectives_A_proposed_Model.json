{"id":"333227353_Flipped_Classroom_from_Computer_Science_Instructors'_Perspectives_A_proposed_Model","abstract":"Technology embedded in higher education institutes needs to be accepted by both learners and instructors to obtain high educational quality and to achieve a successful experience for users. A literature review of the current studies applying a flipped classroom model shows that students were the focus of most of the researchers' interest in investigating the impact of employing the flipped classroom model in computer science education. Therefore, the lack of studies concerning with instructors' acceptance motivates this study to explore instructors' intentions to adopt a flipped classroom model.\nThis paper proposes a model to be used by computer science instructors to evaluate their acceptance of flipped classroom education instead of the traditional classroom. The model will be validated using a research instrument included in the appendix. A literature review shows a lack in studies applying the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model in understanding the acceptance of flipped classroom, in particular from computer science perspectives. Thus, this paper proposes to extend the UTAUT in order to explore factors that influence computer science instructors' intention to adopt flipped classroom in their courses.","authors":["Eman Madani Bakheet","Andrew M.
