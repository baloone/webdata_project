{"id":"301836191_Deep_Shading_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Screen-Space_Shading","abstract":"In computer vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently achieved new levels of performance for several inverse problems where RGB pixel appearance is mapped to attributes such as positions, normals or reflectance. In computer graphics, screen-space shading has recently increased the visual quality in interactive image synthesis, where per-pixel attributes such as positions, normals or reflectance of a virtual 3D scene are converted into RGB pixel appearance, enabling effects like ambient occlusion, indirect light, scattering, depth-of-field, motion blur, or anti-aliasing. In this paper we consider the diagonal problem: synthesizing appearance from given per-pixel attributes using a CNN. The resulting Deep Shading simulates all screen-space effects as well as arbitrary combinations thereof at competitive quality and speed while not being programmed by human experts but learned from example images.","authors":["Oliver Nalbach","Elena Arabadzhiyska","Dushyant Mehta","Hans-Peter Seidel"],"meta":["March 2016Computer Graphics Forum 36(4)","DOI:10.1111/cgf.13225"],"references":["285459125_Is_L2_a_Good_Loss_Function_for_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Processing","281312423_A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style","276923248_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","268689640_Hypercolumns_for_Object_Segmentation_and_Fine-grained_Localization","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","260584488_Real-Time_Screen-Space_Scattering_in_Homogeneous_Environments","256097709_Global_illumination_with_radiance_regression_functions","224189077_CG2Real_Improving_the_Realism_of_Computer_Generated_Images_Using_a_Large_Collection_of_Photographs","220245042_Screen-Space_Perceptual_Rendering_of_Human_Skin","220183372_Convolution_Pyramids","215506196_Comprehensible_Rendering_of_3-D_Shapes","215506032_Image-space_horizon-based_ambient_occlusion","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","321619001_Decision_Forests_for_Computer_Vision_and_Medical_Image_Analysis","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770269_Learning_to_Generate_Chairs_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","312656299_Image_classification_using_random_forests_and_ferns","311893165_Loss_Functions_for_Image_Restoration_With_Neural_Networks","308825079_Learning_to_generate_chairs_with_convolutional_neural_networks","308808582_Hypercolumns_for_object_segmentation_and_fine-grained_localization","308805224_Designing_deep_networks_for_surface_normal_estimation","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","304409792_Direct_Intrinsics_Learning_Albedo-Shading_Decomposition_by_Convolutional_Regression","303518161_The_rendering_equation","303505510_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","300101927_An_approximate_reflectance_profile_for_efficient_subsurface_scattering","283889397_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Filtering_Monte_Carlo_Noise","282433940_Image_Based_Relighting_Using_Neural_Networks","273471892_Deep_Convolutional_Inverse_Graphics_Network","268525233_Designing_Deep_Networks_for_Surface_Normal_Estimation","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262974294_Depth_Map_Prediction_from_a_Single_Image_using_a_Multi-Scale_Deep_Network","262211485_Temporal_Coherence_Methods_in_Real-Time_Rendering","258499814_Describing_Textures_in_the_Wild","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","254007575_A_Reconstruction_Filter_for_Plausible_Motion_Blur","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","233981807_ADADELTA_An_adaptive_learning_rate_method","227633811_A_Survey_of_General-Purpose_Computation_on_Graphics_Hardware","224141981_Analyzing_Visibility_Configurations","221111837_Image_Classification_using_Random_Forests_and_Ferns","220507446_Shadowing_Dynamic_Scenes_with_Arbitrary_BRDFs","220251449_Fast_generation_of_depth_of_field_effects_in_computer_graphics","220183454_An_Approximate_Global_Illumination_System_for_Computer_Generated_Films","215506165_Finding_Next_Gen_Cryengine_2","215506123_The_Rendering_Equation","47863809_Approximating_Dynamic_Global_Illumination_in_Image_Space","2929774_Machine_Learning_for_Computer_Graphics_A_Manifesto_and_Tutorial"]}
