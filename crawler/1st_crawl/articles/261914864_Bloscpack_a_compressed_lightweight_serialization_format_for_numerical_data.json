{"id":"261914864_Bloscpack_a_compressed_lightweight_serialization_format_for_numerical_data","abstract":"This paper introduces the Bloscpack file format and the accompanying Python\nreference implementation. Bloscpack is a lightweight, compressed binary\nfile-format based on the Blosc codec and is designed for lightweight, fast\nserialization of numerical data. This article presents the features of the\nfile-format and some some API aspects of the reference implementation, in\nparticular the ability to handle Numpy ndarrays. Furthermore, in order to\ndemonstrate its utility, the format is compared both feature- and\nperformance-wise to a few alternative lightweight serialization solutions for\nNumpy ndarrays. The performance comparisons take the form of some comprehensive\nbenchmarks over a range of different artificial datasets with varying size and\ncomplexity, the results of which are presented as the last section of this\narticle.","authors":["Valentin Haenel"],"meta":["April 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224223550_The_NumPy_Array_A_Structure_for_Efficient_Numerical_Computation","313184847_A_universal_algorithm_for_sequential_data_compression","245854728_DEFLATE_compressed_data_format_specification_version_13","224124991_Why_Modern_CPUs_Are_Starving_and_What_Can_Be_Done_about_It","3082787_Lempel_A_A_Universal_Algorithm_for_Sequential_Data_Compression_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_233_337-343"]}
