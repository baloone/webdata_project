{"id":"296775506_Microwave_De-Embedding_From_Theory_to_Applications","abstract":"This groundbreaking book is the first to give an introduction to microwave de-embedding, showing how it is the cornerstone for waveform engineering. The authors of each chapter clearly explain the theoretical concepts, providing a foundation that supports linear and non-linear measurements, modelling and circuit design. Recent developments and future trends in the field are covered throughout, including successful strategies for low-noise and power amplifier design. This book is a must-have for those wishing to understand the full potential of the microwave de-embedding concept to achieve successful results in the areas of measurements, modelling, and design at high frequencies. With this book you will learn: The theoretical background of high-frequency de-embedding for measurements, modelling, and design. Details on applying the de-embedding concept to the transistor's linear, non-linear, and noise behaviour. The impact of de-embedding on low-noise and power amplifier design. The recent advances and future trends in the field of high-frequency de-embedding.","authors":["Giovanni Crupi","Dominique Schreurs"],"meta":["November 2013"],"references":[]}
