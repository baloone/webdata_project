{"id":"342356634_Digitalization_of_the_Legal_Field_and_the_Future_of_Large_Law_Firms","abstract":"This paper discusses how large law firms should re-organize themselves to maintain a competitive edge in the increasingly digitalized legal field. While providing a brief historical introduction to the rise of large law firms and the challenges posed by the rise of digital capitalism and the gig economy, the paper proposes an original and radical approach to reforming large law firms in the light of the digitalization. Among other things, the paper discusses (I) the partnership as organizational tool for large law firms in an increasingly digital and agile legal field; (II) the importance of multidisciplinary practices and of the relationship between lawyers and non-lawyers within firms; and (III) the centrality of outsourcing strategies to legal tech companies and other actors in order to deliver legal services more effectively and in a more client-oriented manner.","authors":["Salvatore Caserta"],"meta":["June 2020Laws 9(2):14","DOI:10.3390/laws9020014"],"references":["337578288_Towards_the_Uberisation_of_Legal_Practice","331022253_The_T-shaped_Lawyer_and_Beyond_Rethinking_legal_professionalism_and_legal_education_for_contemporary_societies","330149421_The_Legal_Profession_in_the_Era_of_Digital_Capitalism_Disruption_or_New_Dawn","332862432_The_Craft_of_Sociology_Epistemological_Preliminaries","330944454_The_Lawyer_of_the_Future_as_Transaction_Engineer_Digital_Technologies_and_the_Disruption_of_the_Legal_Profession","328552338_Rethinking_legal_taxonomies_for_the_gig_economy","324595887_The_Concept_of_Digital_Capitalism","320440603_The_State_Nobility_Elite_Schools_in_the_Field_of_Power","318284884_The_Future_of_the_Professions_How_Technology_Will_Transform_the_Work_of_Human_Experts","309639692_Legal_Process_Outsourcing_Redefining_the_Legal_Services_Delivery_Model"]}
