{"id":"247728607_Psychometric_Analysis_of_Computer_Science_Help-Seeking_Scales","abstract":"The purpose of this studywas to develop scales to assess instrumental help seeking, executive help seeking, perceived benefits of help seeking, and avoidance of help seeking and to examine their psychometric properties by conducting factor and reliability analyses. As this is the first attempt to examine the latent structures underlying the measured items, the authors conducted exploratory factor analyses. In addition, they also examined the relationship between the help-seeking scales and motivation and achievement constructs frequently used in the study of academic motivation. Results supported the continued use and development of the newscales, which can be adapted to assess help-seeking behavior across varied academic domains.","authors":["Frank Pajares","Yuk Fai Cheong","Paul Oberman"],"meta":["June 2004Educational and Psychological Measurement 64(3):496-513","DOI:10.1177/0013164403258447"],"references":["270178579_Student_Passivity_A_Study_of_Question_Asking_in_K-12_Classrooms","264894668_The_Role_of_Threat_to_Self-Esteem_and_Perceived_Control_in_Recipient_Reaction_to_Help_Theory_Development_and_Empirical_Validation","263916111_Evaluating_the_Use_of_Exploratory_Factor_Analysis_in_Psychological_Research","254733888_Sample_Size_in_Factor_Analysis","233896081_Development_Between_the_Ages_of_11_and_25","232583872_Student_Differences_in_Self-Regulated_Learning_Relating_Grade_Sex_and_Giftedness_to_Self-Efficacy_and_Strategy_Use","232577556_Predictors_of_Math_Anxiety_and_Its_Influence_on_Young_Adolescents'_Course_Enrollment_Intentions_and_Performance_in_Mathematics","232450414_Why_Do_Some_Students_Avoid_Asking_for_Help_An_Examination_of_the_Interplay_among_Students'_Academic_Efficacy_Teachers'_Social-Emotional_Role_and_the_Classroom_Goal_Structure","209835984_Evaluating_the_use_of_Exploratory_Factor_Analysis_in_psychological_research","43118051_Social_Goals_Academic_Goals_and_Avoiding_Seeking_Help_in_the_Classroom","30845214_Avoiding_Seeking_Help_in_the_Classroom_Who_and_Why","306249051_A_study_of_students'_fears_of_seeking_academic_help_from_teachers","287771101_Achievement_and_achievement_motives_psychological_and_sociological_approaches","284100070_Seeking_academic_assistance_as_a_strategic_learning_resource_Student_motivation_cognition_and_learning_Essays_in_honor_of_Wilbert","271347308_Gender-Related_Differences_in_Self-Referenced_Cognitions_in_Relation_to_Mathematics","250184781_Chapter_2_Help-Seeking_Behavior_in_Learning","242613789_Multiple_Regression_In_Behavioral_Research_-_Explanation_And_Prediction","242376321_Computers_and_Classroom_Culture","240744535_How_Self-Regulated_Learners_Cope_with_Academic_Difficulty_The_Role_of_Adaptive_Help_Seeking","234671307_Seeking_Help_in_Large_College_Classes_Who_Why_and_from_Whom","234571521_Student's_Perceptions_of_the_Teacher_and_Classmates_in_Relation_to_Reported_Help_Seeking_in_Math_Class","233894761_The_Scree_Test_for_the_Number_of_Factors","233062400_Necessary_and_Unnecessary_Help-Seeking_in_Children","232584231_Determinants_of_Help_Seeking_Relations_between_Perceived_Reasons_for_Classroom_Help-Avoidance_and_Help-Seeking_Behaviors_in_an_Experimental_Context","232560288_Children's_Help-Seeking_in_the_Classroom_The_Role_of_Motivational_Factors_and_Attitudes","232549397_Help_Seeking_and_the_Need_for_Academic_Assistance","232541418_Question_Asking_To_Know_That_You_Do_Not_Know_Is_Not_Enough","232540509_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Non-Normal_Variables_Problems_and_Remedies","232537895_Students'_Help_Seeking_during_Problem_Solving_Influences_of_Personal_and_Contextual_Achievement_Goals","232529034_''Should_I_ask_for_help''_The_role_of_motivation_and_attitudes_in_adolescents'_help_seeking_in_math_class","232507082_Avoiding_the_Demonstration_of_Lack_of_Ability_An_Underexplored_Aspect_of_Goal_Theory","232493103_Relationship_of_Academic_Help_Seeking_to_the_Use_of_Learning_Strategies_and_Other_Instrumental_Achievement_Behavior_in_College_Students","232452885_Analysis_of_teacher_judgments_of_pupil_achievement_levels","232452259_Constraints_on_Question_Asking_in_Classrooms","232434143_Children's_Reluctance_to_Seek_Help_With_Schoolwork","230268962_New_methods_in_maximum_likelihood_factor_analysis","226793653_Social_network_interpersonal_concerns_and_help-seeking_in_primary_grade_school_children_as_a_function_of_sex_performance_and_economic_status","225797410_Help-seeking_behavior_in_a_problem-solving_situation_Development_of_self-regulation","223284988_Help-seeking_An_understudied_problem-solving_skill_in_children_1","222750239_Help_seeking_in_elementary_classrooms_An_observational_study","24062216_Latent_roots_of_random_data_correlation_matrices_with_squared_multiple_correlations_on_the_diagonal_A_Monte_Carlo_study","20822810_Children's_self-assessment_of_performance_and_task-related_help_seeking","20810880_Cognitive-Motivational_Influences_on_the_Task-Related_Help-Seeking_Behavior_of_Black_Children","20529856_Children's_Self-Perceptions_of_Competence_and_Help_Seeking","6911135_Exploratory_and_confirmatory_factor_analysis","2470646_Current_Directions_in_Self-efficacy_Research"]}
