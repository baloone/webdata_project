{"id":"230667746_Complex_2D_electric_field_solution_in_undoped_double-gate_MOSFETs","abstract":"new technique to calculate the channel electric field in Double-gate MOSFETs and Schottky barrier Double-gate MOSFETs (SB-DG-MOSFETs) in sub-threshold region is presented. 2D PoissonÂ´s equation is solved in an analytical closed form with the conformal mapping technique. The estimated solution of the two-dimensional electric field with its complex components is analyzed with the bias conditions for accumulation and inversion regions, which have been applied and studied in detail. A comparison with data simulated by 2D TCAD Sentaurus simulator for channel lengths down to 22 nm was made and is in a good agreement to this simulation results.","authors":["Mike Schwarz","Thomas Holtij","Alexander Kloes","Benjamin Iniguez"],"meta":["July 2012IETE Journal of Research 58(3):197-204","DOI:10.4103/0377-2063.97326","Project: Schottky barrier MOSFET devices"],"references":["3074904_Overview_and_status_of_metal_SD_Shottky-barrier_MOSFET_technology","268551117_Electromagnetic_fields_theory_and_application_Vol_I_Mapping_of_fields","230667728_2D_Analytical_Calculation_of_the_Electric_Field_in_Lightly_Doped_Schottky_Barrier_Double-Gate_MOSFETs_and_Estimation_of_the_TunnelingThermionic_Current","230660744_Eine_Verallgemeinerung_der_Quantenbedingungen_fur_Wurfel_Zwecke_der_Wellenmechanik","229359983_2D_analytical_calculation_of_the_electrostatic_potential_in_lightly_doped_Schottky_barrier_Double-Gate_MOSFET","226904534_Eine_Verallgemeinerung_der_Quantenbedingungen_fur_die_Zwecke_der_Wellenmechanik","223053017_A_new_analytical_method_of_solving_2D_Poisson's_equation_in_MOS_devices_applied_to_threshold_voltage_and_subthreshold_modeling","222315642_Multi-gate_devices_for_the_32nm_technology_node_and_beyond","4311720_Multi-gate_devices_for_the_32nm_technology_node_and_beyond"]}
