{"id":"313682568_Contact-Aware_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_for_Mobile_Data_Offloading_in_Opportunistic_Vehicular_Networks","abstract":"To cope with the increasing vehicular traffic and extensive application demands in vehicular cellular networks, opportunistic vehicular networks are used to disseminate mobile data by high-capacity device-to-device communication contacts when vehicles come into the communication range of each other, which offloads significant traffic from the cellular network. The current opportunistic vehicular data transmission models often do not take into account the fact that the contact duration is usually very short, due to the high mobility of vehicles, which will limit the amount of data that can be transmitted during one opportunistic contact. In this work, we consider a mobile data offloading system that integrates cellular network and vehicular opportunistic communications. Based on this proposed system, we establish a mathematical framework to study the problem of contact-aware optimal resource allocation for mobile data offloading by the explicit consideration of the contact duration. Based on theoretical analysis of this problem, we derive an optimal scheme for mobile data offloading to optimally allocate the network resources in terms of opportunistic contacts and offloading helpersâ€™ storage. By carrying out extensive simulation using two realistic urban vehicular traces, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our contact duration aware optimal offloading scheme, in comparison with a wide range of existing schemes.","authors":["Xiangming Zhu","Yong Li","Depeng Jin","Jianhua Lu"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2017.2668396"],"references":["273181940_Opportunistic_Offloading_of_Deadline-Constrained_Bulk_Cellular_Traffic_in_Vehicular_DTNs","254058466_Collaborative_Vehicular_Content_Dissemination_with_Directional_Antennas","254007055_Multiple_mobile_data_offloading_through_delay_tolerant_networks","247195476_Pocket_Switched_Networks_Real-world_mobility_and_its_consequences_for_opportunistic_forwarding","234772650_Cellular_traffic_offloading_through_opportunistic_communications_A_case_study","228363014_Emerging_Vehicular_Applications","224500384_Optimal_and_Scalable_Distribution_of_Content_Updates_over_a_Mobile_Social_Network","224253518_Relieving_the_wireless_infrastructure_When_opportunistic_networks_meet_guaranteed_delays","224208921_Performance_Modeling_of_Message_Dissemination_In_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_with_Priority","224182512_Impact_of_Traffic_Influxes_Revealing_Exponential_Intercontact_Time_in_Urban_VANETs","221244696_MaxProp_Routing_for_Vehicle-Based_Disruption-Tolerant_Networks","221242522_Max-Contribution_On_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_in_Delay_Tolerant_Networks","220926763_Intentional_networking_Opportunistic_exploitation_of_mobile_network_diversity","220747399_Social-Based_Cooperative_Caching_in_DTNs_A_Contact_Duration_Aware_Approach","51990760_Push-and-Track_Saving_Infrastructure_Bandwidth_Through_OpportunisticForwarding","291992160_VADD_Vehicle-assisted_data_delivery_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","290029124_Vehicular_Delay_Tolerant_Networks","286562934_DEMO_Mobile_augmented_reality_-_Tracking_mapping_and_rendering","270776919_Mobile_data_offloading","261336579_Neighbor_discovery_algorithms_in_wireless_networks_using_directional_antennas","261264605_Revealing_patterns_of_opportunistic_contact_durations_and_intervals_for_large_scale_urban_vehicular_mobility","261240948_A_layered_architecture_for_Vehicular_Delay-Tolerant_Networks","260409957_Contact_duration_aware_evaluation_for_content_dissemination_delay_in_mobile_social_network","254037423_Edge-Markovian_dynamic_graph_based_performance_evaluation_for_Delay_Tolerant_Networks","224500440_UNAP_User-Centric_Network-Aware_Push_for_Mobile_Content_Delivery","224137169_Recognizing_Exponential_Inter-Contact_Time_in_VANETs","224088552_Replication_Routing_in_DTNs_A_Resource_Allocation_Approach","223954614_A_Hybrid_Approach_for_Content-based_PublishSubscribe_in_Vehicular_Networks","221241845_User-centric_data_dissemination_in_disruption_tolerant_networks","221234427_Augmenting_mobile_3G_using_WiFi","220978172_Contact_duration_aware_data_replication_in_Delay_Tolerant_Networks","220977978_Win-Coupon_An_incentive_framework_for_3G_traffic_offloading","220926195_Adaptive_contact_probing_mechanisms_for_delay_tolerant_applications","220640016_CodeOn_Cooperative_Popular_Content_Distribution_for_Vehicular_Networks_using_Symbol_Level_Network_Coding","220411077_Mobile_data_offloading_in_metropolitan_area_networks","4092579_DSRC_local_communication_platform_and_its_application_to_information_push_service","3436694_The_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Unified_Cellular_and_Ad-Hoc_Networks","3236826_Socially-aware_Routing_for_Publish-Subscribe_in_Delay-tolerant_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks"]}
