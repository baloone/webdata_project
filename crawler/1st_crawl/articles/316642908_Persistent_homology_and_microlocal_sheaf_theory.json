{"id":"316642908_Persistent_homology_and_microlocal_sheaf_theory","abstract":"We interpret some results of persistent homology and barcodes (in any dimension) with the language of microlocal sheaf theory. For that purpose we study the derived category of sheaves on a real finite-dimensional vector space V. By using the operation of convolution, we introduce a pseudo-distance on this category and prove in particular a stability result for direct images. Then we assume that V is endowed with a closed convex proper cone $\\gamma$ with non empty interior and study $\\gamma$-sheaves, that is, constructible sheaves with microsupport contained in the antipodal to the polar cone (equivalently, constructible sheaves for the $\\gamma$-topology). We prove that such sheaves may be approximated (for the pseudo-distance) by \"piecewise linear\" $\\gamma$-sheaves. Finally we show that these last sheaves are constant on stratifications by $\\gamma$-locally closed sets, an analogue of barcodes in higher dimension.","authors":["Masaki Kashiwara","Pierre Schapira"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Applied and Computational Topology 2(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s41468-018-0019-z"],"references":["241680957_Sheaf_quantization_of_Hamiltonian_isotopies_and_applications_to_nondisplaceability_problems","327643307_Microlocal_theory_of_sheaves_and_Tamarkin's_non_displaceability_theorem","315828328_Microlocal_Theory_of_Sheaves_and_Tamarkin's_Non_Displaceability_Theorem","309572408_Persistence_Diagrams_as_Diagrams_A_Categorification_of_the_Stability_Theorem","303939829_The_Structure_and_Stability_of_Persistence_Modules","301836777_The_three_cusps_conjecture","290181591_Persistence_Theory_From_Quiver_Representations_to_Data_Analysis","285648834_Interactive_Visualization_of_2-D_Persistence_Modules","265440492_Stratified_Morse_Theory","259298218_Metrics_for_Generalized_Persistence_Modules"]}
