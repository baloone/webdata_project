{"id":"258657722_Fast_Data_Acquisition_in_Heavy_Ion_CT_Using_Intensifying_Screen-EMCCD_Camera_System_With_Beam_Intensity_Monitor","abstract":"We investigated the feasibility of fast data acquisition in heavy ion CT (IonCT) technique with an X-ray intensifying screen-charged coupled device (CCD) camera system. This technique is based on measuring the residual range distribution of heavy ions after passing through an object. We took a large number of images with a CCD camera for one projection by changing the range shifter (RS) thickness to obtain a characteristic curve similar to a Bragg curve and then to estimate the relative residual range. We used a high quality Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera, which drastically reduced data acquisition time. We also used a parallel-plate ionization chamber upstream of an object to monitor the time variation in heavy ion beam intensity from a synchrotron accelerator and to perform beam intensity correction for all EMCCD images. Experiments were conducted using a broad beam of 12C, which was generated by spreading out the pencil beam accelerated up to 400 MeV/u by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator, in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, with a scatterer. We demonstrated that a fast CT data acquisition, 14 min for 256 projections, is possible for an electron density phantom, consisting of six rods with a relative electron density resolution of 0.017, using the proposed technique with HIMAC.","authors":["Hiroshi Muraishi","Shinji Abe","Hitoshi Satoh","Hidetake Hara"],"meta":["October 2012IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science 59(5):1934-1939","DOI:10.1109/TNS.2012.2209126"],"references":["23496972_Algorithm_for_X-ray_Scatter_Beam-Hardening_and_Beam_Profile_Correction_in_Diagnostic_Kilovoltage_and_Treatment_Megavoltage_Cone_Beam_CT","12613228_The_measurement_of_proton_stopping_power_using_proton-cone-beam_computed_tomography","3138798_Conceptual_design_of_a_proton_computed_tomography_system_for_applications_in_proton_radiation_therapy","251793691_Heavy_ion_CT_reconstructed_from_range_shift_distribution_measured_by_2D_detection_system","245120877_Measurement_of_electron_density_distribution_using_heavy_ion_CT","233923648_The_Fourier_Reconstruction_of_a_Head_Section","224601077_Evaluation_of_Spatial_Resolution_for_Heavy_Ion_CT_System_Based_on_the_Measurement_of_Residual_Range_Distribution_With_HIMAC","223828089_Proton_computed_tomography_with_a_250_MeV_pulsed_beam","223248572_The_Italian_project_for_a_proton_imaging_device","222406175_Issues_in_Proton_Computed_Tomography","216213494_The_Fourier_Reconstruction_of_a_Head_Section","51839568_Investigations_of_a_flat-panel_detector_for_quality_assurance_measurements_in_ion_Beam_Therapy","22181885_Quantitative_proton_tomography_Preliminary_experiments","18424691_Heavy-Particle_Radiography","16921702_Computed_tomography_using_proton_energy_loss","16786956_The_relation_between_X-ray_CT_numbers_and_charged_particle_stopping_powers_and_its_significance_for_radiotherapy_treatment_planning","12056685_Correction_of_scatter_in_megavoltage_cone-beam_CT","10744251_Heavy_ion_CT_system_based_on_measurement_of_residual_range_distribution","8013387_Patient_specific_optimization_of_the_relation_between_CT-Hounsfield_units_and_proton_stopping_power_with_proton_radiography","6907227_Reconstruction_for_proton_computed_tomography_by_tracing_proton_trajectories_A_Monte_Carlo_study","6900439_Application_of_heavy-ion_CT","3150842_Monte_Carlo_Studies_of_a_Proton_Computed_Tomography_System","3140358_Prototype_Tracking_Studies_for_Proton_CT"]}
