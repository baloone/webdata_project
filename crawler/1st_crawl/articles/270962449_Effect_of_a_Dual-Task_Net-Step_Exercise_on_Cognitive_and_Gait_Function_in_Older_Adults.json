{"id":"270962449_Effect_of_a_Dual-Task_Net-Step_Exercise_on_Cognitive_and_Gait_Function_in_Older_Adults","abstract":"Background and purpose: \nParticipation in generally recommended aerobics or strength exercises may be challenging for older adults. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the types and levels of physical activities suited for them to improve their cognitive and gait function and adherence to exercise programs. This has prompted efforts to identify exercises that require less physical strength and frequency of performance, while still offering cognitive and health benefits. Here, we aimed to assess the effect of a novel dual-task net-step exercise (NSE) performed once a week for 8 consecutive weeks on improvements in cognitive performance and gait function in an older population.\n\nMethods: \nIn this pretest/posttest experimental case control study, 60 healthy older adults (mean age 76.4 years) were recruited from community-dwelling people and separated randomly into 2 groups: a dual-task NSE group and a control group. The NSE group was asked to walk across a net without stepping on the ropes or being caught in the net. Two computer panel-type cognitive functional assessments, the Touch-M and Touch Panel-Type Dementia Assessment Scale, were administered at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention to determine the effects of NSE. Improvements in gait function were also evaluated using Timed Up and Go test scores. Mixed-effect models with repeated measures (group Ã— time) (analysis of variance, F test) were used to test the effects of NSE. Adjustments were made for covariates including age and sex (analysis of covariance).\n\nResults: \nThe NSE group showed significant improvement in cognitive performance (6.8% change; total Touch-M score 5.4 points; P = .04) and gait performance (11.5% change; Timed Up and Go time -0.98 second; P < .001) over the 8-week period. In the control group, there was no significant improvement.\n\nConclusions: \nThis study shows that dual-task NSE is capable of improving cognitive and gait performance in healthy older adults. Our results indicate that NSE offers an option for a large segment of the older population who need an easier way to maintain their cognitive health and gait function.","authors":["Kazutoshi Kitazawa","Satoko Showa","Akira Hiraoka","Yasuhiro Fushiki"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy 38(3)","DOI:10.1519/JPT.0000000000000029","SourcePubMed"],"references":["51436906_Making_Physical_Activity_Accessible_to_Older_Adults_With_Memory_Loss_A_Feasibility_Study","46255627_Benefits_of_Cognitive_Dual-Task_Training_on_Balance_Performance_in_Healthy_Older_Adults","45274872_Effect_of_Cognitive_Remediation_on_Gait_in_Sedentary_Seniors","41465860_Skeletal_muscle_loss_Cachexia_sarcopenia_and_inactivity","26336427_Share_or_compete_Load-dependent_recruitment_of_prefrontal_cortex_during_dual-task_performance","24415366_Dual-Task_Gait_Performance_Among_Community-Dwelling_Senior_Women_The_Role_of_Balance_Confidence_and_Executive_Functions","23763368_Walking_and_Talking_Therapy_Improving_cognitive-motor_dual-tasking_in_neurological_illness","23761840_Dual-Task_Decrements_in_Gait_Contributing_Factors_Among_Healthy_Older_Adults","23233631_Effect_of_Physical_Activity_on_Cognitive_Function_in_Older_Adults_at_Risk_for_Alzheimer_Disease_A_Randomized_Trial","16699086_A_new_rating_scale_for_Alzheimer's_disease_Am_J_Psychiatry_141_1356-1364","7306028_Training-Induced_Functional_Activation_Changes_in_Dual-Task_Processing_An_fMRI_Study","7131293_Timed_Up_Go_Test_Reliability_in_Older_People_Dependent_in_Activities_of_Daily_Living-_Focus_on_Cognitive_State","5287565_Transfer_Effects_in_Task-Set_Cost_and_Dual-Task_Cost_After_Dual-Task_Training_in_Older_and_Younger_Adults_Further_Evidence_for_Cognitive_Plasticity_in_Attentional_Control_in_Late_Adulthood","342359042_The_Effect_of_an_Exercise-Based_Balance_Intervention_on_Physical_and_Cognitive_Performance_for_Older_Adults_A_Pilot_Study","317041220_Physical_Activity_and_Public_Health_in_Older_Adults_Recommendation_From_the_American_College_of_Sports_Medicine_and_the_American_Heart_Association","271573124_Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy_to_Promote_Exercise_Behavior_in_Older_Adults","271234882_Exercise_Is_Associated_with_Reduced_Risk_for_Incident_Dementia_among_Persons_65_Years_of_Age_and_Older","227753073_The_Role_of_Executive_Function_and_Attention_in_Gait","51456442_The_Effect_of_an_Exercise-Based_Balance_Intervention_on_Physical_and_Cognitive_Performance_for_Older_Adults_A_Pilot_Study","51436894_The_Prescribed_Amount_of_Physical_Activity_in_Randomized_Clinical_Trials_in_Older_Adults","50906722_Touch_Panel-type_Dementia_Assessment_Scale_A_new_computer-based_rating_scale_for_Alzheimer's_disease","44613131_Executive_Control_Deficits_as_a_Prodrome_to_Falls_in_Healthy_Older_Adults_A_Prospective_Study_Linking_Thinking_Walking_and_Falling","40868954_Physical_Activity_Guidelines_for_Older_Adults","38035944_Normative_Data_and_Determinants_for_the_Timed_Up_and_Go_Test_in_a_Population-Based_Sample_of_Elderly_Individuals_Without_Gait_Disturbances","26675630_Training_Improves_Multitasking_Performance_by_Increasing_the_Speed_of_Information_Processing_in_Human_Prefrontal_Cortex","24041438_Changes_in_Cognitive_Function_in_a_Randomized_Trial_of_Physical_Activity_Results_of_the_Lifestyle_Interventions_and_Independence_for_Elders_Pilot_Study","23761841_Executive_Functions_Are_Associated_With_Gait_and_Balance_in_Community-Living_Elderly_People","23761838_Guest_Editorial_Linking_Thinking_Walking_and_Falling","23482008_The_Importance_of_Alzheimer_Disease_Assessment_Scale-cognitive_Part_in_Predicting_Progress_for_Amnestic_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_to_Alzheimer_Disease","21163956_The_Timed_Up_Go_A_Test_of_Basic_Functional_Mobility_for_Frail_Elderly_Persons","7530712_Cognitive_behavioral_therapy_to_promote_exercise_behavior_in_older_adults_implications_for_physical_therapists","7354852_Exercise_is_associated_with_reduced_risk_for_incident_dementia_among_Persons_65_years_of_age_and_older","6078680_Physical_Activity_and_Public_Health_in_Older_Adults_Recommendation_From_the_American_College_of_Sports_Medicine_and_the_American_Heart_Association","5935631_Dual-Task_Exercise_Improves_Walking_Ability_in_Chronic_Stroke_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial"]}
