{"id":"319171932_The_Essence_of_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"A decade of discourse to capture the essence of computational thinking has resulted in a broad set of skills whose teaching continue to pose challenges because of the reliance on the use of electronic computers and programming concepts. This article not only links computational thinking skills to fundamental cognitive competencies but also describes pedagogical tools that have proven effective in teaching them at early ages.","authors":["Osman Ya≈üar"],"meta":["January 2017Computing in Science and Engineering 19(4):74-82","DOI:10.1109/MCSE.2017.3151241","Project: Computational Thinking"],"references":["348290591_Epistemological_Psychological_Neurosciences_and_Cognitive_Essence_of_Computational_Thinking","319952625_The_Essence_of_Scientific_and_Engineering_Thinking_and_Tools_to_Promote_It","312015270_Modeling_and_Simulation_How_Everything_Seems_to_Form_and_Grow","305113469_Cognitive_Aspects_of_Computational_Modeling_and_Simulation_in_Teaching_and_Learning","333018834_How_Scientists_Explain_Disease","326213892_How_Scientists_Explain_Disease","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","305380944_The_organization_of_behavior","298972577_On_teaching_abstraction_in_computer_science_to_novices","298698751_In_two_minds_Dual_processes_and_beyond"]}
