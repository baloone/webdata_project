{"id":"282482219_Intel_-Memories_and_the_Microprocessor","abstract":"Intel Corp. was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon E. Moore who gained extensive experience in semiconductor manufacturing as employees of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp. Their goal was to exploit the possibility of designing and manufacturing very complex circuits using the Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) technology. The company's first microprocessor was the 4004, followed by the 8080 which was introduced in 1978. In the early 1980s, Intel introduced the 80286 architecture, the predecessor of the Intel386 chip. This chip set a standard which other players in the industry were forced to meet to remain competitive.","authors":["Gordon E. Moore"],"meta":["December 1996Daedalus 125(2)"],"references":[]}
