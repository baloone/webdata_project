{"id":"236203368_Relativisation_makes_contradictions_harder_for_Resolution","abstract":"We provide a number of simplified and improved separations between pairs of\nResolution-with-bounded-conjunction refutation systems, Res(d), as well as\ntheir tree-like versions, Res*(d). The contradictions we use are natural\ncombinatorial principles: the Least number principle, LNP_n and an ordered\nvariant thereof, the Induction principle, IP_n.\nLNP_n is known to be easy for Resolution. We prove that its relativisation is\nhard for Resolution, and more generally, the relativisation of LNP_n iterated d\ntimes provides a separation between Res(d) and Res(d+1). We prove the same\nresult for the iterated relativisation of IP_n, where the tree-like variant\nRes*(d) is considered instead of Res(d).\nWe go on to provide separations between the parameterized versions of Res(1)\nand Res(2). Here we are able again to use the relativisation of the LNP_n, but\nthe classical proof breaks down and we are forced to use an alternative.\nFinally, we separate the parameterized versions of Res*(1) and Res*(2). Here,\nthe relativisation of IP_n will not work as it is, and so we make a vectorising\namendment to it in order to address this shortcoming","authors":["Stefan Dantchev","Barnaby Martin"],"meta":["April 2013Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 165(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.apal.2013.10.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261469505_Lower_Bounds_for_DNF-refutations_of_a_Relativized_Weak_Pigeonhole_Principle","226450255_On_the_Complexity_of_Resolution_with_Bounded_Conjunctions","225953979_On_Relativisation_and_Complexity_Gap_for_Resolution-Based_Proof_Systems","225492165_A_Complexity_Gap_for_Tree-Resolution","220616898_A_Switching_Lemma_for_Small_Restrictions_and_Lower_Bounds_for_k_-DNF_Resolution","220245494_Generating_Hard_Tautologies_Using_Predicate_Logic_and_the_Symmetric_Group","324707399_Proofs_as_Games","269296610_Parameterized_Proof_Complexity","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","268637008_Proofs_as_Games","268616625_Bounded_Arithmetic_Propositional_Logic_and_Complexity_Theory","256720647_A_characterization_of_tree-like_Resolution_size","228057840_Randomized_Algorithms","225935741_On_the_Automatizability_of_Resolution_and_Related_Propositional_Proof_Systems","224014402_Parameterized_Resolution_with_Bounded_Conjunction","223284060_On_the_complexity_of_resolution_with_bounded_conjunctions","222805511_The_intractability_of_Resolution","222569763_Machine-based_methods_in_parameterized_complexity_theory","222447584_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_I_Recognizable_sets_of_finite_graphs","221935858_Parameterized_Proof_Complexity_and_W1","220944502_Parameterized_Complexity_of_DPLL_Search_Procedures","220719786_Relativisation_Provides_Natural_Separations_for_Resolution-Based_Proof_Systems","220592216_Combinatorics_of_first_order_structures_and_propositional_proof_systems","220139148_Hardness_of_Parameterized_Resolution","220138255_Parameterized_Proof_Complexity_a_Complexity_Gap_for_Parameterized_Tree-like_Resolution","220138193_Parameterized_Bounded-Depth_Frege_Is_Not_Optimal","38381329_The_Relative_Efficiency_of_Propositional_Proof_Systems","2605589_A_Study_of_Proof_Search_Algorithms_for_Resolution_and_Polynomial_Calculus"]}
