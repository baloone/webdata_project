{"id":"355581678_Manipulating_cellular_microRNAs_and_analyzing_high-dimensional_gene_expression_data_using_machine_learning_workflows","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are elements of the gene regulatory network and manipulating their abundance is essential toward elucidating their role in patho-physiological conditions. We present a detailed workflow that identifies important miRNAs using a machine learning algorithm. We then provide optimized techniques to validate the identified miRNAs through over-expression/loss-of-function studies. Overall, these protocols apply to any field in biology where high-dimensional data are produced.\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Wong et al.
