{"id":"276422416_On_the_metric_dimension_of_two_families_of_convex_polytopes","abstract":"A distance between two vertices of a connected graph is the shortest distance between them. The metric dimension of a connected graph G is the minimum cardinality of a subset W of vertices of G such that all vertices are uniquely determined by their distances from W. A family \\(\\mathcal {G}\\) of connected graphs is a family with constant metric dimension if dim(G) is finite and does not depend upon the choice of G in \\(\\mathcal {G}\\) . In this paper we study the metric dimension of two classes of convex polytopes and show that these classes of convex polytopes have constant metric dimension.","authors":["Muhammad Aslam Malik","Musavarah Sarwar"],"meta":["May 2015Afrika Matematika 27(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13370-015-0336-5"],"references":["266983187_On_two_families_of_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","265777085_Classes_of_convex_polytopes_with_constant_metric_dimension","264553359_On_the_metric_dimension_of_Jahangir_graph","220532702_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Cartesian_Products_of_Graphs","267139652_A_subfamily_of_a_generalized_Petersen_graph_Pn3_with_constant_metric_dimension","267069900_A_special_class_of_convex_polytopes_with_constant_metric_dimension","257078944_On_classes_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","256936424_Minimal_doubly_resolving_sets_and_the_strong_metric_dimension_of_some_convex_polytopes","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220513592_On_families_of_convex_polytopes_with_constant_metric_dimension"]}
