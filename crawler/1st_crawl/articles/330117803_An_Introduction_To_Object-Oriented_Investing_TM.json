{"id":"330117803_An_Introduction_To_Object-Oriented_Investing_TM","abstract":"The idea of object-orientation has helped drive progress in computer science, technology and business for the last few decades. In this paper, we introduce Object-Oriented Investing(TM). We demonstrate how the idea of object-orientation can be applied to investing, and some of the beneﬁts it brings to the design, evaluation and deployment of rules-based investment strategies. The relevance of object orientation to investing should not come as a surprise. Ample literature has suggested that the human cognitivevsystem is wired to deal with objects in order to handle complexity. The level of\nabstraction associated with the notion of objects makes it possible for humans to conceptualise highly complex situations and solve intricate problems. Likewise, OOI makes the development, visualisation and implementation of rules-based, and more broadly, all types of investment strategies, faster, more eﬀective and more intuitive, which we hope can help practitioners improve the way they design products, build and manage portfolios.","authors":["Pierre Mendelsohn","Ran Achiron","Sam Fawcett","Alastair Smith"],"meta":["January 2018","Project: Universal asset allocation"],"references":["320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","303426331_Smart_Beta_Managing_Diversification_of_Minimum_Variance_Portfolios","276398881_Factor_neutral_portfolios","273939484_The_Valuation_of_Risk_Assets_and_The_Selection_of_Risky_Investments_in_Stock_Portfolios_and_Capital_Budgets","265578590_Global_Portfolio_Optimization","259480144_Portfolio_Selection","259480025_The_Cross-Section_of_Expected_Stock_Returns","259479989_Equilibrium_in_a_Capital_Asset_Market","247906225_Toward_Maximum_Diversification","247905951_Introducing_the_Multi-Asset_Strategy_Index","24127106_Stochastic_Volatility_Origins_and_Overview","3418856_Coevolutionary_Free_Lunches","247905755_The_Efficient_Market_Inefficiency_of_Capitalization-Weighted_Stock_Portfolios","235926747_Capital_Asset_Prices_A_Theory_of_Market_Equilibrium_Under_Conditions_of_Risk"]}
