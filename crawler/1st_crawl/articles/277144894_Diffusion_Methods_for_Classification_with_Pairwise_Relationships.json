{"id":"277144894_Diffusion_Methods_for_Classification_with_Pairwise_Relationships","abstract":"We define two algorithms for propagating information in classification\nproblems with pairwise relationships. The algorithms involve contraction maps\nand are related to non-linear diffusion and random walks on graphs. The\napproach is also related to message passing and mean field methods. The\nalgorithms we describe are guaranteed to converge on graphs with arbitrary\ntopology. Moreover they always converge to a unique fixed point, independent of\ninitialization. We prove that the fixed points of the algorithms under\nconsideration define lower-bounds on the energy function and the max-marginals\nof a Markov random field. Our theoretical results also illustrate a\nrelationship between message passing algorithms and value iteration for an\ninfinite horizon Markov decision process. We illustrate the practical\nfeasibility of our algorithms with preliminary experiments in image restoration\nand stereo depth estimation.","authors":["Pedro F. Felzenszwalb","Benar F.
