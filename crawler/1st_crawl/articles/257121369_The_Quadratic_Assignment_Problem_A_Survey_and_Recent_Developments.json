{"id":"257121369_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_A_Survey_and_Recent_Developments","abstract":"Quadratic Assignment Problems model many applications in diverse areas such as operations research, parallel and distributed computing, and combinatorial data analysis. In this paper we survey some of the most important techniques, applications, and methods regarding the quadratic assignment problem. We focus our attention on recent developments.","authors":["Panos Pardalos","Franz Rendl","Henry Wolkowicz"],"meta":["August 1994","DOI:10.1090/dimacs/016/01","In book: Quadratic assignment and related problems (New Brunswick, NJ, 1993) (pp.1-42)Publisher: Amer.
