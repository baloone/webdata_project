{"id":"305077794_A_Survey_on_Feature_Drift_Adaptation_Definition_Benchmark_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"Data stream mining is a fast growing research topic due to the ubiquity of data in several real-world problems. Given their ephemeral nature, data stream sources are expected to undergo changes in data distribution, a phenomenon called concept drift. This paper focuses on one specific type of drift that has not yet been thoroughly studied, namely feature drift. Feature drift occurs whenever a subset of features becomes, or ceases to be, relevant to the learning task; thus, learners must detect and adapt to these changes accordingly. We survey existing work on feature drift adaptation with both explicit and implicit approaches. Additionally, we benchmark several algorithms and a naive feature drift detection approach using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results from our experiments indicate the need for future research in this area as even naive approaches produced gains in accuracy while reducing resources usage. Finally, we state current research topics, challenges and future directions for feature drift adaptation.","authors":["Jean Paul Barddal","Heitor Murilo Gomes","Fabr√≠cio Enembreck","Bernhard Pfahringer"],"meta":["July 2016Journal of Systems and Software 127","DOI:10.1016/j.jss.2016.07.005"],"references":["305083748_Advancing_feature_selection_research","305083742_Drift_Detection_Using_Stream_Volatility","299056991_Incremental_Rule_Learning_and_Border_Examples_Selection_from_Numerical_Data_Streams","289529742_A_Survey_on_Feature_Drift_Adaptation","284716986_Analyzing_the_Impact_of_Feature_Drifts_in_Streaming_Learning","313501942_A_streaming_ensemble_algorithm_SEA_for_large-scale_classification","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","303166622_On_evaluating_stream_learning_algorithms","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","290872065_A_Feature_Selection_Method_Using_Hierarchical_Clustering"]}
