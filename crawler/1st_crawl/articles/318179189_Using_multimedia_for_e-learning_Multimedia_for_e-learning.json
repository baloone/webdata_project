{"id":"318179189_Using_multimedia_for_e-learning_Multimedia_for_e-learning","abstract":"This paper reviews 12 research-based principles for how to design computer-based multimedia instructional materials to promote academic learning, starting with the multimedia principle (yielding a median effect size of d = 1.67 based on five experimental comparisons), which holds that people learn better from computer-based instruction containing words and graphics rather than words alone. Principles aimed at reducing extraneous processing (i.e., cognitive processing that is unrelated to the instructional objective) include coherence (d = 0.70), signalling (d = 0.46), redundancy (d = 0.87), spatial contiguity (d = 0.79) and temporal contiguity (d = 1.30). Principles for managing essential processing (i.e., mentally representing the essential material) include segmenting (d = 0.70), pre-training (d = 0.46) and modality (d = 0.72). Principles for fostering generative processing (i.e., cognitive processing aimed at making sense of the material) include personalization (d = 0.79), voice (d = 0.74) and embodiment (d = 0.36). Some principles have boundary conditions, such as being stronger for low- rather than high-knowledge learners.","authors":["Richard Mayer"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Computer Assisted Learning 33(1)","DOI:10.1111/jcal.12197"],"references":["325203559_Handbook_of_Motivation_at_School","320567572_Co-thought_gestures_in_children's_mental_problem_solving_Prevalence_and_effects_on_subsequent_performance","285310335_Integrated_model_of_text_and_picture_comprehension","284556232_Scientific_Research_in_Education","284097727_Making_things_hard_on_yourself_but_in_a_good_way_Creating_desirable_difficulties_to_enhance_learning","280777774_The_Effect_of_Working_Memory_Capacity_on_Multimedia_Learning_Does_Attentional_Control_Result_in_Improved_Performance","271617485_Cognitive_consequences_of_segmentation_and_modality_methods_in_learning_from_instructional_animations","270634188_The_Alleged_Crisis_and_the_Illusion_of_Exact_Replication","263936573_Reducing_Verbal_Redundancy_in_Multimedia_Learning_An_Undesired_Desirable_Difficulty","262915119_Principles_for_reducing_extraneous_processing_in_multimedia_learning_Coherence_signaling_redundancy_spatial_contiguity_and_temporal_contiguity_principles","258279017_Designing_Instructional_Text_in_a_Conversational_Style_A_Meta-analysis","258180568_Improving_Students'_Learning_With_Effective_Learning_Techniques","248498142_Integrating_information_A_meta-analysis_of_the_spatial_contiguity_and_temporal_contiguity_effects","330332159_MOOCs","321525690_Cognitive_Load_Theory","319352112_Managing_split-attention_and_redundancy_in_multimedia_instruction","304861449_e-Learning_and_the_Science_of_Instruction_Fourth_Edition","304861043_Cambridge_Handbook_of_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","304860437_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","297933714_Verbal_redundancy_in_multimedia_learning_When_reading_helps_listening","292884042_Principles_for_managing_essential_processing_in_multimedia_learning_Segmenting_pre-training_and_modality_principles","292883843_The_multimedia_principle","292879950_Principles_based_on_social_cues_in_multimedia_learning_Personalization_voice_image_and_embodiment_principles","292812635_The_challenge_of_multimedia_literacy","289963492_Visible_Learning","288079605_Measuring_cognitive_load","284573317_Instructional_strategies_for_virtual_aviation_training_environments","284557533_Incorporating_learner_experience_into_the_design_of_multimedia_instruction","283436775_The_collaborative_design_and_development_of_moocs_for_teacher_professional_development","281101487_Effects_of_Observing_the_Instructor_Draw_Diagrams_on_Learning_From_Multimedia_Messages","280895089_Animations_Need_Narrations_An_Experimental_Test_of_a_Dual-Coding_Hypothesis","280798740_For_Whom_Is_a_Picture_Worth_a_Thousand_Words_Extensions_of_a_Dual-Coding_Theory_of_Multimedia_Learning","278647688_Cognitive_Load_Theory","277515353_Editors'_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section_on_Replicability_in_Psychological_Science_A_Crisis_of_Confidence","275852941_Teachers_and_Machines_The_Classroom_Use_of_Technology_since_1920","272786898_Cognitive_load_theory_the_transient_information_effect_and_e-learning","271636854_Cueing_animations_Dynamic_signaling_aids_information_extraction_and_comprehension","265092365_The_Cambridge_Handbook_Of_Multimedia_Learning","263105320_Does_segmenting_principle_counteract_modality_principle_in_instructional_animation","260914087_Benefits_of_emotional_design_in_multimedia_instruction","259137979_Emotional_design_in_multimedia_learning_Effects_of_shape_and_color_on_affect_and_learning","257690772_A_review_of_research_and_a_meta-analysis_of_the_seductive_detail_effect","257252978_Is_spoken_text_always_better_Investigating_the_modality_and_redundancy_effect_with_longer_text_presentation","257252919_Modality_and_cueing_in_multimedia_learning_Examining_cognitive_and_perceptual_explanations_for_the_modality_effect","257252746_When_graphics_improve_liking_but_not_learning_from_online_lessons","248497702_A_closer_look_at_split_visual_attention_in_system-_and_self-paced_instruction_in_multimedia_learning","247954607_The_Principles_of_Teaching_Based_on_Psychology","247870046_The_Evolution_of_American_Educational_Technology","246899937_Multimedia_learning_in_an_interactive_self-explaining_environment_What_works_in_the_design_of_agent","246304314_Generative_Learning_Processes_of_Comprehension","242073456_How_pacing_of_multimedia_instructions_can_influence_modality_effects_A_case_of_superiority_of_visual_texts","243775786_A_split-attention_effect_in_multimedia_learning_Evidence_for_dual_processing_systems_in_working_memory","242337323_How_Inspecting_a_Picture_Affects_Processing_of_Text_in_Multimedia_Learning","239545795_The_case_for_social_agency_in_computer-based_teaching_Do_students_learn_more_deeply_when_they_interact_with_animated_pedagogical_agents","238680916_Managing_Split-Attention_and_Redundancy_in_Multimedia_Instruction"]}
