{"id":"239926276_A_Categorization_of_Novice_Programmers_A_Cluster_Analysis_Study","abstract":"Beginning software engineering students often lack skills nec- essary to perform efficient programming work, such as comprehending or debugging program code. To facilitate the needs of students having dif- ferent skill levels, teachers should be able to recognize the specific student groups. Bloom's Taxonomy defines educational objectives for the development of students' cognitive skills. This paper presents a study of 254 undergrad- uate students of a basic programming course whose performance were measured on different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. The results of statis- tical cluster analysis suggest that the obtained student groups did not align with the Bloom's Taxonomy: students performing poorly on lower levels can still perform well on higher taxonomy levels. Based on the re- sults, this paper suggests six student groups the teacher should recognize when organizing basic programming courses.","authors":["Essi Lahtinen"],"meta":["May 2012"],"references":["267793963_Clustering_of_students_of_engineering_mathematics_based_on_their_attitudes_orientations_motivations_and_intentions","247699381_Taxonomy_o_f_Educational_Objectives_Cognitive_Domain","200085837_Learning_and_Teaching_Programming_A_Review_and_Discussion","44828922_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_a_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives"]}
