{"id":"230786177_Iterative_Correction_of_Hi-C_Data_Reveals_Hallmarks_of_Chromosome_Organization","abstract":"Extracting biologically meaningful information from chromosomal interactions obtained with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C) analyses requires the elimination of systematic biases. We present a computational pipeline that integrates a strategy to map sequencing reads with a data-driven method for iterative correction of biases, yielding genome-wide maps of relative contact probabilities. We validate this ICE (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition) technique on published data obtained by the high-throughput 3C method Hi-C, and we demonstrate that eigenvector decomposition of the obtained maps provides insights into local chromatin states, global patterns of chromosomal interactions, and the conserved organization of human and mouse chromosomes.","authors":["Maxim Imakaev","Geoffrey Fudenberg","Rachel Patton McCord","Natalia Naumova"],"meta":["September 2012Nature Methods 9(10):999-1003","DOI:10.1038/nmeth.2148","SourcePubMed"],"references":["231583385_The_spatial_organization_of_centromeric_heterochromatin_during_normal_human_lymphopoiesis_Evidence_for_ontogenically_determined_spatial_patterns","223976608_Spatial_partitioning_of_the_regulatory_landscape_of_the_X-inactivation_centre","223976604_Topological_Domains_in_Mammalian_Genomes_Identified_by_Analysis_of_Chromatin_Interactions","221766911_Three-Dimensional_Folding_and_Functional_Organization_Principles_of_the_Drosophila_Genome","51924410_Genome_architectures_revealed_by_tethered_chromosome_conformation_capture_and_population-based_modeling","51723706_Probabilistic_modeling_of_Hi-C_contact_maps_eliminates_systematic_biases_to_characterize_global_chromosomal_architecture","51640064_Generalized_Schemes_for_High-Throughput_Manipulation_of_the_Desulfovibrio_vulgaris_Genome","51196521_Systematic_bias_in_high-throughput_sequencing_data_and_its_correction_by_BEADS","270051434_Identification_and_Analysis_of_Functional_Elements_in_1_of_The_Human_Genome_by_The_ENCODE_Pilot_Project","221839033_Spatial_Organization_of_the_Mouse_Genome_and_Its_Role_in_Recurrent_Chromosomal_Translocations"]}
