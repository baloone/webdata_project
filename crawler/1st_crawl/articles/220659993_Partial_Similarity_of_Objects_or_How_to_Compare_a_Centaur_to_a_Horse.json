{"id":"220659993_Partial_Similarity_of_Objects_or_How_to_Compare_a_Centaur_to_a_Horse","abstract":"Similarity is one of the most important abstract concepts in human perception of the world. In computer vision, numerous applications deal with comparing objects observed in a scene with some a priori known pat- terns. Often, it happens that while two objects are not similar, they have large similar parts, that is, they are partially similar. Here, we present a novel approach to quantify partial similarity using the notion of Pareto optimality. We exemplify our approach on the problems of recognizing non-rigid geometric objects, images, and analyzing text sequences.","authors":["Alexander M. Bronstein","Michael Bronstein","Alfred M.
