{"id":"267130795_Some_strings_in_Dyck_paths","abstract":"The enumeration of Dyck paths according to various statistics has been studied in several papers. This paper deals with the statistics \"number of τ's\" for several strings τ. More precisely, the strings (azā)j, (azā)ja and aiāaj, where z is a fixed Dyck path, are considered and several known results, as well as many new ones, are derived.","authors":["A.
