{"id":"307516860_Guest_Editorial_Big_Data_Analytics_for_Grid_Modernization","abstract":"Advanced analytics plays a vital role in the era of big data, such as managing smart cities, predicting crime activities, optimizing medicine formula based on genetic defects, detecting financial frauds, and personalizing marketing campaigns. Information extracted from the big data benefits many industries in their day-to-day operations. The deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), smart meters and other smart devices has offered engineers the access to a large variety of data at an unprecedented granularity and volume. However, the old data management systems and applications are not designed to handle the big data. Therefore, how to extract actionable information and values out of the big data and how to integrate the information into grid operations and planning to ensure the secure, reliable and economical supply of electricity are becoming increasingly critical.","authors":["Tao Hong","Chen Chen","Jianwei Huang","Ning Lu"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid 7(5):2395-2396","DOI:10.1109/TSG.2016.2593358"],"references":[]}
