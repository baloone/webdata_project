{"id":"289659994_First-Order_Reasoning_for_Attempto_Controlled_English","abstract":"RACE is a first-order reasoner for Attempto Controlled English (ACE) that can show the (inconsistency cy of a set of ACE axioms, prove ACE theorems from ACE axioms and answer ACE queries from ACE axioms. In each case RACE gives a proof justification in ACE and full English. This paper is a system description of RACE sketching its structure, its implementation, its operation and its user interface. The power and the limitations of RACE are demonstrated and discussed by concrete examples.","authors":["Norbert E.
