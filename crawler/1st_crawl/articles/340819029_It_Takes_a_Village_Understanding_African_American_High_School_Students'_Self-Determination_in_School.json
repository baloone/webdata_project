{"id":"340819029_It_Takes_a_Village_Understanding_African_American_High_School_Students'_Self-Determination_in_School","abstract":"The present study examined African American high school students’ perceptions of their development and use of self-determination skills (e.g., goal setting, choice/decision making, self-advocacy, etc.) in school. The term development refers to the cultivation of self-determination skills through various means (e.g., structured learning opportunities), and the term use refers to students actually employing the skills in school and other settings across time. We conducted four focus group interviews with a predominately African American female sample to examine (a) how various self-determination skills contributed to their success in school and (b) how they developed these skills through community-based support. Key findings indicate that the participants perceived their use of multiple self-determination skills as facilitating their success in school by helping them (a) be independent, (b) remain motivated in school, (c) prioritize their time, and (d) receive support from classroom teachers. Through their involvement in community-based programs, the participants developed the skills through hands-on activities, group discussions, field trips (e.g., college visits), and interacting with peers in their community organization. Findings from this research support calls for educators to promote African American students’ self-determination while taking a culturally responsive approach by collaborating with local community-based organizations that were developed to support these students.","authors":["Janise S.
