And, at this platform, it is playing its Communicating with it needs an huge and deep understanding ability of Coronaviruses and then one \ncan make a clear mission and charts in the form of COVID-19. This paper is based on a review of previous paper in the field of computer science and Coronaviruses and the thinking of some storing and \nresults of the before studies about COVID-19 epidemic. The dual faced terms of this virus of the world covering economical factors and social factors and some difficulties also. The world is now at a war in \nterms of this epidemic, hence, in various shapes , arts and ethics. This confirmation makes clear methods in the facial changed paths of the society in summation to the upcoming pathways of computer science. \nThis research refers that there is a thing what can use basic console application in the future to fight with such kind of epidemic. The upcoming technological pretends such as AI and iot have a future task \nin the development of this kind of epidemiological field and controlation also. In this paper we are going to show a simple console application or program which will encourage new undergraduate students \nabout to know what is the power of programming also.","authors":["Sritha Zith Dey Babu","Dey Babu","Habeebullah Hussaini Syed"],"meta":["May 2020SSRN Electronic Journal 7(5):21-30"],"references":[]}
