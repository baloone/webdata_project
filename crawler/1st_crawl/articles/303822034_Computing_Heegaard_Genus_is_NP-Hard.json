{"id":"303822034_Computing_Heegaard_Genus_is_NP-Hard","abstract":"We show that {\\sc Heegaard Genus}, the problem of deciding whether a triangulated 3-manifold admits a Heegaard splitting of genus less than or equal to $g$, is NP-hard. The result follows from a quadratic time reduction of the NP-complete problem {\\sc CNF-SAT} to {\\sc Heegaard Genus}.","authors":["David Bachman","Ryan Derby-Talbot","Eric Sedgwick"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["301878836_Some_Conditionally_Hard_Problems_on_Links_and_3-Manifolds","301845428_Finding_Non-orientable_Surfaces_in_3-Manifolds","265458183_The_Classification_of_Heegaard_Splittings_for_Compact_Orient_Able_Surface_S1","315328839_Foliations_and_the_topology_of_3-manifolds","314828912_3-manifold_knot_genus_is_NP-complete","312750990_An_algorithm_to_recognize_the_3-sphere","288167950_Finiteness_results_for_Heegaard_surfaces_in_surgered_manifolds","266536759_Knottedness_is_in_modulo_GRH","265825993_Topology_and_Combinatorics_of_3-Manifolds","265333403_Theorie_der_Normalflachen_Ein_Isotopiekriterium_fur_den_Kreisknoten"]}
