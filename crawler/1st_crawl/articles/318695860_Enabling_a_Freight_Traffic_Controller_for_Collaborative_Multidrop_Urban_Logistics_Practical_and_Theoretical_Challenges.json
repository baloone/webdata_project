{"id":"318695860_Enabling_a_Freight_Traffic_Controller_for_Collaborative_Multidrop_Urban_Logistics_Practical_and_Theoretical_Challenges","abstract":"There is increasing interest into how horizontal collaboration between parcel carriers might help alleviate problems associated with last-mile logistics in congested urban centres. Through a detailed examination of parcel logistics literature pertaining to collaboration, along with practical insights from carriers operating in the UK, this paper examines the challenges that will be faced in optimising multi-carrier, multi-drop collection and delivery schedules. We propose the concept of the ‘Freight Traffic Controller’ (FTC) who would be a trusted third-party, assigned to equitably manage the work allocation between collaborating carriers and the passage of vehicles over the last mile where joint benefits to the parties were achievable. Creating this FTC requires a combinatorial optimisation approach to evaluate the many combinations of hub locations, network configuration and vehicle/walking routing options in order to find the true value of each potential collaboration, whilst at the same time, considering the traffic, social and environmental impacts of these activities. Cooperative game theory is a way to investigate the formation of collaborations (or coalitions) and our analysis identifies a significant shortfall in current applications of this theory to last-mile parcel logistics. Specifically, we identify that application of theory to urban freight logistics has, thus far, failed to account for critical concerns including: i) the mismatch of vehicle parking locations relative to actual delivery addresses; ii) the combination of deliveries with collections, the latter often being received in real-time during the round; and iii) the variability in travel times and route options due to traffic and road network conditions.","authors":["Julian Allen","Tolga Bektaş","Tom Cherrett","Adrian Friday"],"meta":["April 2017Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board 2609(1):77-84","DOI:10.3141/2609-09"],"references":["299460374_Enabling_Carrier_Collaboration_via_Order_Sharing_Double_Auction_A_Singapore_Urban_Logistics_Perspective","294119671_Improved_Collaborative_Transport_Planning_at_Dutch_Logistics_Service_Provider_Fritom","275543650_A_Comparative_Assessment_of_the_Light_Goods_Vehicle_Fleet_and_the_Scope_to_Reduce_its_CO2_Emissions_in_the_UK_and_France","273453916_Joint_operational_decision-making_in_collaborative_transportation_networks_The_role_of_IT","259147479_Horizontal_Cooperation_in_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Backhauling_and_Environmental_Criteria","257715637_Improving_Urban_Freight_Transport_Sustainability_by_Carriers_-_Best_Practices_from_The_Netherlands_and_the_EU_Project_CityLog","257715510_Defining_and_Evaluating_Collaborative_Urban_Freight_Transportation_Systems","257697787_Service_network_design_models_for_two-tier_city_logistics","257196300_A_review_of_dynamic_vehicle_routing_problems","254802711_Horizontal_cooperation_in_transport_and_logistics_A_literature_review","241376298_Understanding_the_Meaning_of_Collaboration_in_the_Supply_Chain","220413309_Models_for_Evaluating_and_Planning_City_Logistics_Systems","32038602_Horizontal_cooperation_among_freight_carriers_Request_allocation_and_profit_sharing","303509335_An_effects_analysis_of_logistics_collaboration_in_last-mile_networks_for_CEP_delivery_services","285833852_Chapter_8_Stochastic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","285833612_Chapter_11_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","283436326_A_decade_of_supply_chain_collaboration_and_directions_for_future_research","258906532_Collaborative_Logistics_from_the_Perspective_of_Road_Transportation_Companies","257196616_Cooperative_game_theory_approach_to_allocating_benefits_of_horizontal_cooperation","251670919_A_less-than-truckload_carrier_collaboration_planning_problem_under_dynamic_capacities","239665415_Network_Design_and_Transportation_Planning_Models_and_Algorithms","228359313_A_Framework_for_an_Efficient_Implementation_of_Logistics_Collaborations","227427091_The_Pollution-Routing_Problem","226390822_Collaboration_in_Cargo_Transportation","220413380_Allocating_Costs_in_a_Collaborative_Transportation_Procurement_Network","220196303_Cooperative_planning_in_express_carrier_networks_-_An_empirical_study_on_the_effectiveness_of_a_real-time_Decision_Support_System","34435852_Non-cooperative_aspects_of_cooperative_game_theory_and_related_computational_problems","4867099_On_the_Core_of_Routing_Games_with_Revenues"]}
