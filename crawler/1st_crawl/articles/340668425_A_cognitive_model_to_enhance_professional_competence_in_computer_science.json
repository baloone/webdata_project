{"id":"340668425_A_cognitive_model_to_enhance_professional_competence_in_computer_science","abstract":"The paper presents the results of the cognitive modeling of the COMPUTER SCIENCE terminological system in the form of a thesaurus. The thesaurus comprises over 3000 units, which are drawn from explanatory monolingual and bilingual dictionaries of computer science terms representing the basic phenomena and processes in the professional context. Methodologically, the analysis is based on the frame model and focuses on semantic relations specific to the sphere of computer science in terms of ontological and epistemological features. The thesaurus facilitates the detailed description and effective arrangement of the terminological system characterized by a complicated hierarchical structure, and thus plays a crucial role in forming and developing professional competencies.","authors":["Evgeniya Aleshinskaya","Ahmad Albatsha"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 169:326-329","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.02.191"],"references":["266466487_A_Cognitive_Approach_to_Teaching_English_for_Special_Purposes_ESP","222962645_Mind_mapping_applications_in_special_teaching_methods_courses_for_science_teacher_candidates_and_teacher_candidates'_opinions_concerning_the_applications","46287616_Does_the_mind_map_learning_strategy_facilitate_information_retrieval_and_critical_thinking_in_medical_students","49660754_Mind_mapping_as_a_teaching_resource"]}
