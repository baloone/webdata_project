The simulated cavity includes nanofluids containing copper (Cu) nanoparticles. The L-shaped thermal element exists in this cavity to produce heat distribution along with the domain. Results such as fluid velocity distribution in two dimensions and the fluid temperature field were generated as CFD simulation results. These outputs were evaluated using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for learning and then the prediction process. In the training process related to the ANFIS method, x coordinates, y coordinates, and fluid temperature are three inputs, and the fluid velocity in line with Y is the output. During the learning process, the data have been classified using a clustering method called grid clustering. In line with the attempt to rise ANFIS intelligence, the alterations in the number of input parameters and of membership structure have been analyzed. After reaching the highest level of intelligence, the fluid velocity nodes were predicted to be in line with y, especially cavity nodes, which were absent in CFD simulations. The simulation findings indicated that there is a good agreement between CFD and clustering approach, while the total simulation time for learning and prediction is shorter than the time needed for calculation using the CFD method.","authors":["Narjes Nabipour","Meisam Babanezhad","Ali Taghvaie Nakhjiri","Saeed Shirazian"],"meta":["February 2020ACS Omega XXXX(XXX)","DOI:10.1021/acsomega.9b03911"],"references":["338995471_Prediction_of_flow_characteristics_in_the_bubble_column_reactor_by_the_artificial_pheromone-based_communication_of_biological_ants","338105459_Prediction_of_fluid_pattern_in_a_shear_flow_on_intelligent_neural_nodes_using_ANFIS_and_LBM","338590496_Visualization_of_nanofluid_flow_field_by_adaptive-network-based_fuzzy_inference_system_ANFIS_with_cubic_interpolation_particle_approach","337636528_A_general_model_for_prediction_of_BaSO4_and_SrSO4_solubility_in_aqueous_electrolyte_solutions_over_a_wide_range_of_temperatures_and_pressures","337276956_Simulation_of_a_Bubble-Column_Reactor_by_Three-Dimensional_CFD_Multidimension-_and_Function-Adaptive_Network-Based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","337120553_Flow_visualization_and_analysis_of_thermal_distribution_for_the_nanofluid_by_the_integration_of_fuzzy_c-means_clustering_ANFIS_structure_and_CFD_methods","337009226_Feasibility_of_ANFIS-PSO_and_ANFIS-GA_Models_in_Predicting_Thermophysical_Properties_of_Al_2_O_3_-MWCNTOil_Hybrid_Nanofluid","335228362_On_the_thermal_characteristics_of_a_manifold_microchannel_heat_sink_subjected_to_nanofluid_using_two-phase_flow_simulation","334551399_Effect_of_sonication_characteristics_on_stability_thermophysical_properties_and_heat_transfer_of_nanofluids_A_comprehensive_review","334109669_Computational_simulation_and_theoretical_modeling_of_CO2_separation_using_EDA_PZEA_and_PS_absorbents_inside_the_hollow_fiber_membrane_contactor"]}
