{"id":"312750358_Fostering_the_Link_from_PLM_to_ERP_via_BIM","abstract":"This paper investigates approaches for linking Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) via structured data stemming from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to information systems that get applied for Enterprise Resource planning (ERP) across Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). The author highlights key pathways for such integration, with a particular focus on the hurdles contractors, suppliers and manufacturers need to overcome to master their transition to BIM-enabled PLM and the associated ERP. Based on a case-study (Hickory Group), the paper analyses the opportunities for the strategic repositioning of a construction and manufacturing firm who combines PLM with BIM and ERP within its organisation.","authors":["Dominik Holzer"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-45937-9_8","Conference: IFIP International Conference on Product Lifecycle Management"],"references":["230898834_Integrating_resource_production_and_construction_using_BIM","30869127_Management_and_Integration_of_Product_Information_in_Construction_Reality_and_Future_Trends","243784093_Building_Product_Models-Computer_Environments_Supporting_Design_and_Construction","220170915_A_survey_of_the_potential_for_enterprise_resource_planning_ERP_in_improving_the_effectiveness_of_construction_management_in_the_UK_construction_industry"]}
