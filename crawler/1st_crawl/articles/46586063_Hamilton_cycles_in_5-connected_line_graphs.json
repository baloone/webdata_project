{"id":"46586063_Hamilton_cycles_in_5-connected_line_graphs","abstract":"A conjecture of Carsten Thomassen states that every 4-connected line graph is\nhamiltonian. It is known that the conjecture is true for 7-connected line\ngraphs. We improve this by showing that any 5-connected line graph of minimum\ndegree at least 6 is hamiltonian. The result extends to claw-free graphs and to\nHamilton-connectedness.","authors":["Tomáš Kaiser","Petr Vrána"],"meta":["September 2010European Journal of Combinatorics 33(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2011.09.015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234980516_Structure_Of_Multi-Quasiparticle_Isomers_In_The_Region_Of_177Lu","220548967_Hamilton_connectivity_of_line_graphs_and_claw-free_graphs","220532674_Cycles_Intersecting_Edge-Cuts_of_Prescribed_Sizes","308565955_On_Eulerian_and_Hamiltonian_graphs_and_line-graphs","265990534_Cycle_decompositions_2-coverings_removable_cycles_and_the_four-color-_disease","247004976_On_Eulerian_and_Hamiltonian_Graphs_and_Line_Graphs","245946412_Disjoint_Steiner_trees_in_graphs_without_large_bridges","244964271_A_Note_Concerning_some_Conjectures_on_Cyclically_4-Edge_Connected_3-Regular_Graphs","229759552_Hamiltonian_Results_in_K13-free_Graphs","227736953_Reflections_on_graph_theory","227704661_Line_graphs_of_multigraphs_and_Hamilton-connectedness_of_claw-free_graphs","223198987_Edge-disjoint_trees_containing_some_given_vertices_in_a_graph","222695972_Eulerian_subgraphs_and_Hamilton-connected_line_graphs","222657539_On_Decomposing_a_Hypergraph_Into_K_Connected_Sub-Hypergraphs","222350911_On_a_Closure_Concept_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","220569823_Hamiltonicity_of_6-connected_line_graphs","220549049_Edge_Disjoint_Steiner_Trees_in_Graphs_Without_Large_Bridges","220192981_Every_4-connected_line_graph_of_a_quasi_claw-free_graph_is_hamiltonian_connected","220187061_On_hamiltonian_line_graphs_and_connectivity","220082185_Contractible_Subgraphs_Thomassen's_Conjecture_and_the_Dominating_Cycle_Conjecture_for_Snarks","220076106_Every_3-connected_essentially_11-connected_line_graph_is_Hamiltonian","220074898_Equivalence_of_Fleischner's_and_Thomassen's_Conjectures","45884410_A_short_proof_of_the_tree-packing_theorem","31023456_Edge-Disjoint_Spanning_Trees_of_Finite_Graphs","31023421_On_the_Problem_of_Decomposing_a_Graph_into_n_Connected_Factors","30530351_Indecomposable_r-graphs_and_some_other_counterexamples"]}
