{"id":"329757412_GroupMe_Investigating_Use_of_Mobile_Instant_Messaging_in_Higher_Education_Courses","abstract":"In this study, the use of the mobile instant messaging (MIM) tool GroupMe was explored in the higher education context. The tool was used to facilitate online course discussions, small group work, and other course communications in face-to-face and online sections of two graduate educational technology courses. Over 900 postings were generated from 29 participants, then coded and analyzed by the researchers. Qualitative data was also obtained through an e-mail follow-up questionnaire. Findings indicate that the MIM platform afforded students opportunities to engage in productive course-relevant conversations and provided additional ways for learners to exhibit online social presence through tool features. Recommendations for the use of MIM to support teaching and learning and suggestions for further scholarly inquiry are discussed.","authors":["Susie Gronseth","Waneta Hebert"],"meta":["December 2018TechTrends 63(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-018-0361-y"],"references":["326178133_Student_participation_in_online_discussion_boards_in_a_higher_education_setting","320638120_WhatsApp_Goes_to_School_Mobile_Instant_Messaging_between_Teachers_and_Students","309627860_WhatsApp_Messaging_Achievements_and_Success_in_Academia","260985018_Exploring_the_Use_of_Text_and_Instant_Messaging_in_Higher_Education_Classrooms","325538010_Advancing_Social_Presence_Community_and_Cognition_Through_Online_Discussions","317020465_Is_mobile_instant_messaging_MIM_useful_in_education_Examining_its_technological_pedagogical_and_social_affordances","312898876_2_theory_of_transactional_distance","311697502_Connecting_and_Engaging_with_Students_Through_Group_Me","304007391_Mobile_Instant_Messaging_Support_for_Teaching_and_Learning_in_Higher_Education","284786313_Building_models_explaining_student_participation_behavior_in_asynchronous_online_discussion","257926050_Seven_Principles_of_Good_Practice_in_Undergraduate_Education","257252924_Transactional_distance_revisited_Bridging_face_and_empirical_validity","255711596_Exploring_the_use_of_asynchronous_online_discussion_in_health_care_education_A_literature_review","251576110_Constant_companions_Instant_messaging_conversations_as_sustainable_supportive_study_structures_amongst_undergraduate_peers","248540852_Effective_pedagogical_practices_for_online_teaching_Perception_of_experienced_instructors"]}
