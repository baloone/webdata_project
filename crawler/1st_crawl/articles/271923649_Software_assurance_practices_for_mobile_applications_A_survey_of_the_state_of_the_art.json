{"id":"271923649_Software_assurance_practices_for_mobile_applications_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","abstract":"Mobile software applications have to cope with a particular environment that involves small size, limited resources, high autonomy requirements, competitive business models and many other challenges. To provide development guidelines that respond to these needs, several practices have been introduced; however, it is not clear how these guidelines may contribute to solve the issues present in the mobile domain. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the mobile ecosystem challenges many of the premises upon which the proposed practices were designed. In this paper, we present a survey of the literature on software assurance practices for mobile applications, with the objective of describing them and assessing their contribution and success. We identified, organized and reviewed a body of research that spans in three levels: software development processes, software product assurance practices, and software implementation practices. By carrying out this literature survey, we reviewed the different approaches that researchers on Software Engineering have provided to address the needs that raise in the mobile software development arena. Moreover, we review the evolution of these practices, identifying how the constant changes and modernization of the mobile execution environment has impacted the methods proposed in the literature. Finally, we introduced discussion on the application of these practices in a real productive setting, opening an area for further research that may determine if practitioners have followed the proposed assurance paradigms.","authors":["Luis Corral","Alberto Sillitti","Giancarlo Succi"],"meta":["March 2014Computing 97(10)","DOI:10.1007/s00607-014-0395-8"],"references":["322897673_Survey_of_mobile_development_approaches","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","286936435_Android_Passive_MVC_Novel_Architecture_Model_for_the_Android_Application_Development","266652972_The_dark_side_of_agile_software_development","262253605_Quality_Factors_in_Development_Best_Practices_for_Mobile_Applications","261150209_Mobile_Development_Process_Spiral","261092725_Considering_Context_Events_in_Event-Based_Testing_of_Mobile_Applications","258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01","258432548_Agile_Software_Development_Processes_for_Mobile_Systems_Accomplishment_Evidence_and_Evolution","254041958_Software_testing_of_mobile_applications_Challenges_and_future_research_directions","228724814_Keynote_Mobile_software_development-the_business_opportunity_of_today","221560176_Software_engineering_issues_for_mobile_application_development","221418580_Technical_Reviews_in_Agile_Development_Case_Mobile-DTM","221322054_Mobile-D_An_Agile_Approach_for_Mobile_Application_Development","221270778_Lessons_from_early_stages_design_of_mobile_applications","221045909_Deploying_Agile_Practices_in_Organizations_A_Case_Study","4167601_Proposition_of_an_M-Business_Procedure_Model_for_the_Development_of_Mobile_User_Interfaces","4016795_New_directions_on_agile_methods_A_comparative_analysis","2886929_Quality_Attributes_in_Mobile_Web_Application_Development","290650433_Agile_architecting_The_use_of_architectural_patterns_in_mobile_java_applications","266467892_Mobile_Application_Software_Engineering_Challenges_and_Research_Directions","265923365_Agile_Development_Methods_for_Mobile_Applications","264822963_The_m_d-matrix_A_learning_tool_in_the_mobile_application_development_course","262321532_Towards_high-quality_mobile_applications_by_a_systematic_integration_of_patterns","261280521_Mobile_performance_metrics_for_resource_management","261127145_A_Mobile_Software_Quality_Model","261048716_SLeSS_A_Scrum_and_Lean_Six_Sigma_Integration_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Sofware_Customization_for_Mobile_Phones","252043821_A_comparative_analysis_of_digital_innovation_ecosystems","234816087_Scrum_to_support_mobile_application_development_projects_in_a_just-in-time_learning_context","232638587_The_Death_of_Binary_Software_End_User_Software_Moves_to_the_Web","224606568_Testing_requirements_for_mobile_applications","224362373_Performance_Evaluation_of_Mobile_Software_Systems_Challenges_for_a_Software_Engineer","224196645_Challenges_for_mobile_application_development","224149516_Visiting_Mobile_Application_Development_What_How_and_Where","224146043_Adaptive_random_testing_of_mobile_application","221593054_Metrics_evaluation_for_context-aware_computing","221508186_An_efficiency-centric_design_methodology_for_mobile_application_architectures","221318256_The_4-Tier_Design_Pattern_for_the_Development_of_an_Android_Application","221237519_Usability_metric_for_mobile_application_a_goal_question_metric_GQM_approach","220921428_Agile_Software_Development_of_Mobile_Information_Systems","220302116_Challenges_Methodologies_and_Issues_in_the_Usability_Testing_of_Mobile_Applications","4372633_Designing_an_agile_methodology_for_mobile_software_development_A_hybrid_method_engineering_approach","4356794_Business_Model_Engineering_Analysis_on_Mobile_Client-Side_Software_Platform_Strategies","4325190_Development_Process_of_Mobile_Application_SW_Based_on_Agile_Methodology","4175579_Software_performance_and_resource_utilisation_metrics_for_context-aware_mobile_applications","2463662_Software_Engineering_for_Mobility_A_Roadmap"]}
