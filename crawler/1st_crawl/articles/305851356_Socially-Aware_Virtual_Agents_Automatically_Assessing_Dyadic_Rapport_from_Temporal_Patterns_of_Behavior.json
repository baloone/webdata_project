{"id":"305851356_Socially-Aware_Virtual_Agents_Automatically_Assessing_Dyadic_Rapport_from_Temporal_Patterns_of_Behavior","abstract":"This work focuses on data-driven discovery of the temporally co-occurring and contingent behavioral patterns that signal high and low interper-sonal rapport. We mined a reciprocal peer tutoring corpus reliably annotated for nonverbals like eye gaze and smiles, conversational strategies like self-disclosure and social norm violation, and for rapport (in 30 second thin slices). We then performed a fine-grained investigation of how the temporal profiles of sequences of interlocutor behaviors predict increases and decreases of rapport, and how this rapport management manifests differently in friends and strangers. We validated the discovered behavioral patterns by predicting rapport against our ground truth via a forecasting model involving two-step fusion of learned temporal associated rules. Our framework performs significantly better than a baseline linear regression method that does not encode temporal information among behavioral features. Implications for the understanding of human behavior and social agent design are discussed.","authors":["Ran Zhao","Tanmay Sinha","Alan W Black","Justine Cassell"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-47665-0_20","Conference: 16th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) [BEST STUDENT PAPER]"],"references":["311990462_Socially-Aware_Animated_Intelligent_Personal_Assistant_Agent","305851166_Automatic_Recognition_of_Conversational_Strategies_in_the_Service_of_a_Socially-Aware_Dialog_System","301462510_Evaluating_Speech_Face_Emotion_and_Body_Movement_Time-series_Features_for_Automated_Multimodal_Presentation_Scoring","292148165_Multimodal_Public_Speaking_Performance_Assessment","304847689_Student-Student_Interaction_The_Neglected_Variable_In_Education","301462557_Predicting_Participation_Styles_using_Co-occurrence_Patterns_of_Nonverbal_Behaviors_in_Collaborative_Learning","300361283_Towards_a_Dyadic_Computational_Model_of_Rapport_Management_for_Human-Virtual_Agent_Interaction","295672394_Different_Futures_of_Adaptive_Collaborative_Learning_Support","287897366_Learning_temporal_association_rules_on_Symbolic_time_sequences","285573784_Reciprocal_Tutoring_Design_with_Cognitive_Load_Sharing"]}
