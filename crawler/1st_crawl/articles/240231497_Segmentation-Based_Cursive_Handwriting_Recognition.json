{"id":"240231497_Segmentation-Based_Cursive_Handwriting_Recognition","abstract":"In this chapter, word recognition algorithms based on segmentation of a word image into primitive components (characters and sub-characters) and concurrent concatenation and recognition of these primitive components will be described. Two approaches to word recognition are discussed: i) context-free recognition where the recognition system yields an optimum letter string and a lexicon is used as a post-processor to select the best match and ii) lexicon directed recognition, where a presegmented word image is matched against all the words of the lexicon to obtain the best match. While word recognition may be based on context-free or lexicon directed techniques, numeral string recognition such as ZIP Code recognition or courtesy amount recognition in a bank check etc. is always based on context-free techniques. The recognition of words in a document follows a hierarchical scheme as described below: i) remove tilt (skew) of the document, ii) extract lines of words from document, iii) remove slant from each line, iv), extract words from each line, v) presegmentation of each word into primitive components (characters and subcharacters), vi) concatenation of components followed by character recognition to recognize each word. In this chapter, lexicon directed word recognition will be discussed in detail. The extension to context-free recognition will be illustrated. Results based on extensive testing with handwritten addresses obtained from the United States Postal Service are presented.","authors":["M. Shridar","F.
