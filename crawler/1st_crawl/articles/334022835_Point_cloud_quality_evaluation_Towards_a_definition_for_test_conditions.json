{"id":"334022835_Point_cloud_quality_evaluation_Towards_a_definition_for_test_conditions","abstract":"Recently stakeholders in the area of multimedia representation and transmission have been looking at plenoptic technologies to improve immersive experience. Among these technologies, point clouds denote a volumetric information representation format with important applications in the entertainment, automotive and geographical mapping industries. There is some consensus that state-of-the-art solutions for efficient storage and communication of point clouds are far from satisfactory. This paper describes a study on point cloud quality evaluation, conducted in the context of JPEG Pleno to help define the test conditions of future compression proposals. A heterogeneous set of static point clouds in terms of number of points, geometric structure and represented scenarios were selected and compressed using octree-pruning and a projection-based method, with three different levels of degradation. The models were comprised of both geometrical and color information and were displayed using point sizes large enough to ensure observation of watertight surfaces. The stimuli under assessment were presented to the observers on 2D displays as animations, after defining suitable camera paths to enable visualization of the models in their entirety and realistic consumption. The experiments were carried out in three different laboratories and the subjective scores were used in a series of correlation studies to benchmark objective quality metrics and assess inter-laboratory consistency","authors":["Luis A da Silva Cruz","Emil Dumic","Evangelos Alexiou","Joao Prazeres"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1109/QoMEX.2019.8743258","Conference: 2019 Eleventh International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)At: Berlin, Germany","Project: Point cloud subjective quality assessment"],"references":["328913566_Subjective_and_Objective_Quality_Assessment_for_Volumetric_Video_Compression","298724522_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_a_Point_Cloud_Codec_for_Tele-Immersive_Video","221068443_3D_is_here_Point_cloud_library_PCL","327513150_Point_Cloud_Quality_Assessment_Metric_Based_on_Angular_Similarity","327513048_Point_cloud_subjective_evaluation_methodology_based_on_reconstructed_surfaces","327513044_A_novel_methodology_for_quality_assessment_of_voxelized_point_clouds","327511281_Point_Cloud_Subjective_Evaluation_Methodology_based_on_2D_Rendering","323352228_Geometric_distortion_metrics_for_point_cloud_compression","321402077_Subjective_and_objective_quality_evaluation_of_compressed_point_clouds","320264165_Towards_subjective_quality_assessment_of_point_cloud_imaging_in_augmented_reality","319588130_Subjective_and_objective_quality_evaluation_of_3D_point_cloud_denoising_algorithms","318123100_On_subjective_and_objective_quality_evaluation_of_point_cloud_geometry","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","281738459_A_subjective_quality_evaluation_for_3D_point_cloud_models","260665631_Comparison_of_the_Coding_Efficiency_of_Video_Coding_Standards-Including_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding_HEVC"]}
