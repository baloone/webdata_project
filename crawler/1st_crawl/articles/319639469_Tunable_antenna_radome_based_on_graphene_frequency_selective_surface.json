{"id":"319639469_Tunable_antenna_radome_based_on_graphene_frequency_selective_surface","abstract":"In this paper, a graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed. The proposed FSS exhibits a tunable bandpass filtering characteristic due to the alterable conductivity of the graphene strips which is controlled by chemical potential. Based on the reconfigurable bandpass property of the proposed FSS, a cylindrical antenna radome is designed using the FSS unit cells. A conventional omnidirectional dipole can realize a two-beam directional pattern when it is placed into the proposed antenna radome. Forward and backward endfire radiations of the dipole loaded with the radome is realized by properly adjusting the chemical potential. The proposed antenna radome is extremely promising for beam-scanning in terahertz and mid-infrared plasmonic devices and systems when the gain of a conventional antenna needs to be enhanced.","authors":["Meijun Qu","Menglou Rao","Shufang Li","li Deng"],"meta":["September 2017AIP Advances 7(9):095307","DOI:10.1063/1.5003020"],"references":["315634071_Enhanced_Tunable_Microstrip_Attenuator_Based_on_Few_Layer_Graphene_Flakes","314167070_Spatially_mutual_coupling_reduction_between_CP-MIMO_antennas_using_FSS_superstrate","314017824_An_Angularly_Stable_Dual-Band_FSS_with_Closely_Spaced_Resonances_Using_Miniaturized_Unit_Cell","313831151_Designing_Graphene-Based_Absorber_by_Using_HIE-FDTD_Method","313814090_Performance_Analysis_Of_Hybrid_Metal-Graphene_Frequency_Reconfigurable_Antennas_For_The_Microwave_Regime","313806620_Graphene_Fabry-Perot_Cavity_Leaky-Wave_Antennas_Plasmonic_vs_Non-plasmonic_Solutions","313782314_A_Compact_Dual-Band_Beam-Sweeping_Antenna_Based_on_Active_Frequency_Selective_Surfaces","312646610_Using_the_ADI-FDTD_Method_to_Simulate_Graphene-Based_FSS_at_Terahertz_Frequency","311621642_A_Novel_Dual-Band_Ultrathin_FSS_with_Closely_Settled_Frequency_Response","305695819_A_Wideband_Absorber_With_a_Multiresonant_Gridded-Square_FSS_for_Antenna_RCS_Reduction"]}
