{"id":"301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","abstract":"Motivated by a conjecture of Gy\\'arf\\'as, recently B\\\"ottcher, Hladk\\'y, Piguet, and Taraz showed that every collection $T_1,\\dots,T_t$ of trees on $n$ vertices with $\\sum_{i=1}^te(T_i)\\leq \\binom{n}{2}$ and with bounded maximum degree, can be packed into the complete graph on $(1+o(1))n$ vertices. We generalise this result where we relax the restriction of packing families of trees to families of graphs of any given non-trivial minor-closed class of graphs.","authors":["Silvia Messuti","Vojtěch Rödl","Mathias Schacht"],"meta":["February 2016Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 119","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2016.03.003"],"references":["262985496_An_approximate_version_of_the_Tree_Packing_Conjecture","321444126_A_separator_theorem_for_nonplanar_graphs","319321979_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","288945035_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","268496537_Random_Graphs","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n","266060249_Near_Perfect_Coverings_in_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","265322290_Packing_Trees","243134638_EveryH-decomposition_ofKnhas_a_Nearly_Resolvable_Alternative","238719218_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Nonplanar_Graphs","223154642_Asymptotic_behavior_of_the_chromatic_index_for_hypergraphs","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method"]}
