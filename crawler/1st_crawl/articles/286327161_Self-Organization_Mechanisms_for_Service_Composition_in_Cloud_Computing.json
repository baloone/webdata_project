{"id":"286327161_Self-Organization_Mechanisms_for_Service_Composition_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Cloud computing is becoming an interesting alternative as a flexible and affordable on-demand environment for deploying custom applications in the form of services. In this work, a self-organizing system model based on dynamic relation network is proposed. In the model, autonomic element can self-adapted to the weight of the relationship under the guidance of the self-organizing policy. Based on this organization model, we present the service-oriented dynamic self-organizing algorithm in Cloud computing, which implement autonomic element self-organization through service finding, service composition, task implementation and service optimization.","authors":["Lirong Qiu"],"meta":["March 2014International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology 7(2):321-330","DOI:10.14257/ijhit.2014.7.2.28"],"references":[]}
