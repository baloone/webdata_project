{"id":"228851403_The_Vertex_Cover_Algorithm","abstract":"We present a new polynomial-time algorithm for finding minimal vertex covers in graphs. It is shown that every graph with n vertices and maximum vertex degree  must have a minimum vertex cover of size at most nn(+1) and that this condition is the best possible in terms of n and . The algorithm finds a minimum vertex cover in all known examples of graphs. In view of the importance of the P versus NP question, we ask if there exists a graph for which the algorithm cannot find a minimum vertex cover. The algorithm is demonstrated by finding minimum vertex covers for several famous graphs, including two large benchmark graphs with hidden minimum vertex covers. We implement the algorithm in C++ and provide a demonstration program for Microsoft Windows [download].","authors":["Ashay Dharwadker"],"meta":[],"references":["221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","267779325_The_Vertex_Coloring_Algorithm","248390389_Graphs_of_degree_3_with_given_abstract_group","246406246_Hypohamiltonian_and_Hypotraceable_Graphs","245922366_Die_Theorie_der_Regulren_Graphen","242608703_Sur_le_Probleme_des_Courbes_Gauches_en_Topologie","241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic","229329705_Regular_line-symmetric_graphs","228891166_The_Clique_Algorithm","228891162_The_independent_set_algorithm","225660001_Die_Theorie_der_Regularen_Graphs","222644906_Space-Bounded_Reducibility_among_Combinatorial_Problems"]}
