{"id":"266261794_Graph_properties_of_graph_associahedra","abstract":"A graph associahedron is a simple polytope whose face lattice encodes the\nnested structure of the connected subgraphs of a given graph. In this paper, we\nstudy certain graph properties of the 1-skeleta of graph associahedra, such as\ntheir diameter and their Hamiltonicity. Our results extend known results for\nthe classical associahedra (path associahedra) and permutahedra (complete graph\nassociahedra). We also discuss partial extensions to the family of nestohedra.","authors":["Thibault Manneville","Vincent Pilaud"],"meta":["September 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["303491640_Rotation_distance_triangulations_and_hyperbolic_geometry","265362895_Generation_of_Permutations_by_Adjacent_Transposition","262805478_The_diameter_of_type_D_associahedra_and_the_non-leaving-face_property","243119652_Generation_of_permutations_by_adjacent_transposition","243075837_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I_II","242529835_The_Associahedron_and_Triangulations_of_the_n-gon","240155703_One_Hundred_Problems_in_Elementary_Mathematics","239667754_Hopf_Algebra_of_the_Planar_Binary_Trees","239060229_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I","237131519_Discriminants_Resultants_and_Multidimensional_Determinants"]}
