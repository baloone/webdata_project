{"id":"353184180_Waldschmidt_constant_of_certain_sets_of_points_with_3_supporting_lines_in_projective_plane","abstract":"The paper shows values of the initial degree and Waldschmidt constant for some special cases including severalcases of ten points with three supporting lines in projective plane. These constants represent the complexity of optimal solutions in repeated path problems that have many applications in computer science, informatics theory and telecommunications.","authors":["Tu NGUYEN","Dang Tuan Hiep"],"meta":["June 2021Journal of Science and Technology Issue on Information and Communications Technology 19(6.2):52","DOI:10.31130/ict-ud.2021.127"],"references":["301875981_Chudnovsky's_Conjecture_for_very_general_points_in_mathbbP_kN","280695750_The_Waldschmidt_constant_for_squarefree_monomial_ideals","50893529_Are_symbolic_powers_highly_evolved","348466021_Initial_degree_and_Waldschmidt_constant_of_zero_schemes_and_properties","301839301_A_containment_result_in_mathbbPn_and_the_Chudnovsky_conjecture","280148511_Symbolic_powers_of_ideals_in_kP_N","253304145_Symbolic_powers_of_ideals_of_generic_points_in_P3","242975429_Sur_une_minoration_du_degr_d'hypersurfaces_s'annulant_en_certains_points","240150390_On_the_14-th_problem_of_Hilbert","233555817_Inverse_system_of_a_symbolic_power_III_Thin_algebras_and_fat_points","2104503_Comparison_of_symbolic_and_ordinary_powers_of_ideals","2113744_On_the_postulation_of_sd_fat_points_in_Pd"]}
