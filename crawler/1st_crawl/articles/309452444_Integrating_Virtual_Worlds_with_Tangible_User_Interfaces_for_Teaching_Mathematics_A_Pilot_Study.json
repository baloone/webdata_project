{"id":"309452444_Integrating_Virtual_Worlds_with_Tangible_User_Interfaces_for_Teaching_Mathematics_A_Pilot_Study","abstract":"This article presents a pilot study of the use of two new tangible interfaces and virtual worlds for teaching geometry in a secondary school. The first tangible device allows the user to control a virtual object in six degrees of freedom. The second tangible device is used to modify virtual objects, changing attributes such as position, size, rotation and color. A pilot study on using these devices was carried out at the “Florida Secundaria” high school. A virtual world was built where students used the tangible interfaces to manipulate geometrical figures in order to learn different geometrical concepts. The pilot experiment results suggest that the use of tangible interfaces and virtual worlds allowed a more meaningful learning (concepts learnt were more durable).","authors":["Graciela Guerrero Idrovo","Andrés Ayala","Juan Mateu","Laura Casades"],"meta":["October 2016Sensors 16(11):1775","DOI:10.3390/s16111775","Project: Virtual Touch"],"references":["283962768_Tangible_Programming_Environment_Using_Paper_Cards_as_Command_Objects","279319258_Technical_Problems_Experienced_in_the_Transformation_of_Virtual_Worlds_into_an_Education_Environment_and_Coping_Strategies","257666487_StoryCube_Supporting_children's_storytelling_with_a_tangible_tool","250262768_Towards_Natural_Intuitive_and_Non-intrusive_HCI_Devices_for_Roundtable_Meetings","248914118_Brave_New_Interactive_Worlds_A_review_of_the_design_affordances_and_constraints_of_two_3D_virtual_worlds_as_interactive_learning_environments","318494427_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_And_Powerful_Ideas","264244451_VirtualTouch_A_Tool_for_Developing_Mixed_Reality_Educational_Applications_and_an_Example_of_Use_for_Inclusive_Education","257424962_Practice_context_dialogue_using_automated_conversational_agents_to_extend_the_reach_and_depth_of_learning_activities_in_immersive_worlds","257236418_Design-based_research_on_the_use_of_a_tangible_user_interface_for_geometry_teaching_in_an_inclusive_classroom","239021523_The_Grasp_of_Consciousness"]}
