{"id":"220975873_When_Can_You_Play_Positionally","abstract":"We consider infinite antagonistic games over finite graphs. We present conditions that, whenever satisfied by the payoff mapping, assure for both players positional (memoryless) optimal strategies. To verify the robustness of our conditions we show that all popular payoff mappings, such as mean payoff, discounted, parity as well as several other payoffs satisfy them.","authors":["Hugo Gimbert","Wieslaw Zielonka"],"meta":["August 2004Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-28629-5_53","SourceDBLP","Conference: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 2004, 29th International Symposium, MFCS 2004, Prague, Czech Republic, August 22-27, 2004, Proceedings"],"references":["242549332_Finite-Step_Algorithms_for_Single-Controller_and_Perfect_Information_Stochastic_Games","221591753_Trees_Automata_and_Games","312982657_Stochastic_games","269024497_Infinite_Words_Automata_Semigroups_Logic_and_Games","266225126_Prolongement_des_jeux_a_deux_joueurs_de_somme_nulle_Une_theorie_abstraite_des_duels","266066629_Competitive_Markov_Decision_Processes","226645887_Positional_strategies_for_mean_payoff_games","222415046_Model_Checking_Discounted_Temporal_Properties","221570214_Perfect-Information_Stochastic_Parity_Games","220896900_Discounting_the_Future_in_Systems_Theory"]}
