{"id":"282041757_Impact_of_Perceived_Security_on_Organizational_Adoption_of_Smartphones","abstract":"Organizational adoption of new technologies is a practically important research area. The present study aims to investigate the impact of perceived security on organizational adoption of mobile communication technologies, specifically smartphones. For this purpose, a research model is developed extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The research model is tested using a structural equation modeling based on data that were collected from senior managers of 201 private sector organizations in Turkey. The results show that, along with the traditional constructs of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, perceived security significantly affects organizations' adoption of smartphones. Both the theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","authors":["Ibrahim Arpaci","Yasemin Yardimci Cetin","Ozgur Turetken"],"meta":["September 2015Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking 18(10)","DOI:10.1089/cyber.2015.0243"],"references":["283328988_SPSS_for_Intermediate_Statistics_Use_and_Interpretation_Fifth_Edition","272790646_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","264090112_Older_Adults'_Text_Entry_on_Smartphones_and_Tablets_Investigating_Effects_of_Display_Size_and_Input_Method_on_Acceptance_and_Performance","262156567_Empirical_Investigation_of_the_Cognitive_Factors_that_Influence_the_Continued_Use_of_Smartphones_by_College_Students_Who_are_Using_Smartphones_to_Participate_in_the_Future_Global_Distributed_Teams","256478111_Increasing_Self-_Regulatory_Energy_Using_an_Internet-_Based_Training_Application_Delivered_by_Smartphone_Technology","237020302_Factors_Influencing_Purchase_Intention_of_Private_Label_Products_The_Case_of_Smartphones","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","225981411_Utilization-Focused_Evaluation_Checklist","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","211396614_Innovation_diffusion_in_global_contexts_Determinants_of_post-adoption_digital_transformation_of_European_companies","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","35465050_A_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_Empirically_Testing_New_End-User_Information_Systems","321534479_Utilization-focused_evaluation_4th_edition","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312368182_Use_acceptance_of_information_technology_Toward_a_unified_view","308058706_The_theory_of_planned_behavior_organizational_behavior_and_human_decision_processes","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","287771331_Significance_test_and_goodness_of_fit_in_the_analysis_of_covariance_structures","284060858_The_roots_of_utilization-focused_evaluation","281189215_Comparative_fit_indices_in_structural_models","276356781_How_Culture_Influences_the_Social_in_Social_Media_Socializing_and_Advertising_on_Smartphones_in_India_and_the_United_States","272787052_Educational_Research_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitive_and_Qualitative_Research","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","270909818_Effects_of_Body_Image_on_College_Students'_Attitudes_Toward_DietFitness_Apps_on_Smartphones","269903579_Structural_Equation_Modeling_Concepts_Issues_and_Applications","269777562_Effects_of_security_and_privacy_concerns_on_educational_use_of_cloud_services","267922562_The_Diffusion_of_Innovations","261325666_Does_screen_size_matter_for_smartphones_Utilitarian_and_hedonic_effects_of_screen_size_on_smartphone_adoption","260678594_Measuring_Perceived_Security_in_B2C_Electronic_Commerce_Website_Usage_A_Respecification_and_Validation","260305584_Determining_the_Factors_that_Influence_College_Students'_Adoption_of_Smartphones","243081509_The_Effect_of_Standardization_on_a_ch_2_Approximation_in_Factor_Analysis","241156399_Determinants_of_E-Commerce_Development_An_Empirical_Study_by_Firms_in_Shaanxi_China","239295005_Goodness-of-fit_indexes_in_confirmatory_factor_analysis_The_effect_of_sample_size","237009923_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_A_Global_Perspective","235932894_Principles_And_Practice_Of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","232571279_The_structural_equation_modeling_approach_Basic_concepts_and_fundamental_issues","229433973_The_Integrated_Model_of_Smartphone_Adoption_Hedonic_and_Utilitarian_Value_Perceptions_of_Smartphones_Among_Korean_College_Students","224773289_Structural_Equations_With_Latent_Variables","223699378_Adoption_of_Internet_banking_An_empirical_study_in_Hong_Kong","223425916_Effects_of_consumer_characteristics_on_their_acceptance_of_online_shopping_Comparisons_among_different_product_types","220694510_Diffusion_of_innovations_5_ed","220672355_Perceived_security_and_World_Wide_Web_purchase_intention","220653511_Consumer_perception_of_interface_quality_security_and_loyalty_in_electronic_commerce","220259955_Perceived_Usefulness_Ease_of_Use_and_Usage_of_Information_Technology_A_Replication","220259935_Electronic_Data_Interchange_and_Small_Organizations_Adoption_and_Impact_of_Technology","200824469_Goodness-of-Fit_Indexes_in_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_The_Effect_of_Sample_Size_Miscellaneous_Article","39406694_Discovering_statistics_using_IBM_SPSS_statistics","31845710_Diffusion_of_Innovations_EM_Rogers","24061959_A_second_generation_Little_Jiffy","23130871_Corneal_infections_author's_transl","11436373_Principles_and_Practice_in_Reporting_Structural_Equation_Analyses","20834790_Comparative_Fit_Indexes_in_Structural_Models","19750628_Dimensionality_of_Coping_Factor_Stability_Using_the_Ways_of_Coping_Questionnaire"]}
