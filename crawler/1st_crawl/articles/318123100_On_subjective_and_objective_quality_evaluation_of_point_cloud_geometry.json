{"id":"318123100_On_subjective_and_objective_quality_evaluation_of_point_cloud_geometry","abstract":"Point clouds have emerged as a promising solution for immersive representation of 3D contents. In this paper an interactive subjective quality assessment for point clouds is proposed. Quality assessment of geometry information in point clouds subject to realistic types of degradations is performed and correlation between state-of-the-art objective metrics and ground truth subjective scores is investigated. Preliminary results suggest that there is a need for more appropriate objective metrics, since the current solutions are not able to provide accurate predictions of quality for every type of degradations and contents.","authors":["Evangelos Alexiou","Touradj Ebrahimi"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/QoMEX.2017.7965681","Conference: 2017 Ninth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)At: Erfurt, Germany","Project: Point cloud subjective quality assessment"],"references":["298724522_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_a_Point_Cloud_Codec_for_Tele-Immersive_Video","227611629_METRO_Measuring_error_on_simplified_surfaces","221068443_3D_is_here_Point_cloud_library_PCL","323352228_Geometric_distortion_metrics_for_point_cloud_compression","281738459_A_subjective_quality_evaluation_for_3D_point_cloud_models"]}
