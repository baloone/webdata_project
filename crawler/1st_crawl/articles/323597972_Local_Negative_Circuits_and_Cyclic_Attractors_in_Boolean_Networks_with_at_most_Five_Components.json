{"id":"323597972_Local_Negative_Circuits_and_Cyclic_Attractors_in_Boolean_Networks_with_at_most_Five_Components","abstract":"We consider the following question on the relationship between the asymptotic behaviours of Boolean networks and their regulatory structures: does the presence of a cyclic attractor imply the existence of a local negative circuit in the regulatory graph? When the number of model components $n$ verifies $n \\geq 6$, the answer is known to be negative. We show that the question can be translated into a Boolean satisfiability problem on $n \\cdot 2^n$ variables. A Boolean formula expressing the absence of local negative circuits and a necessary condition for the existence of cyclic attractors is found unsatisfiable for $n \\leq 5$. In other words, for Boolean networks with up to 5 components, the presence of a cyclic attractor requires the existence of a local negative circuit.","authors":["Elisa Tonello","Etienne Farcot","Claudine Chaouiya"],"meta":["March 2018SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems 18(1)","DOI:10.1137/18M1173988"],"references":["324499591_Stable_States_of_Boolean_Regulatory_Networks_Composed_Over_Hexagonal_Grids","322038936_A_circuit-preserving_mapping_from_multilevel_to_Boolean_dynamics","315457188_On_the_conversion_of_multivalued_gene_regulatory_networks_to_Boolean_dynamics","286513697_Negative_local_feedbacks_in_Boolean_networks","285790636_Local_cycles_and_dynamical_properties_of_Boolean_networks","267091089_DRAT-trim_Efficient_Checking_and_Trimming_Using_Expressive_Clausal_Proofs","265462109_On_the_Relation_Between_the_Logical_Structure_of_Systems_and_Their_Ability_to_Generate_Multiple_Steady_States_or_Sustained_Oscillations","257000789_From_kernels_in_directed_graphs_to_fixed_points_and_negative_cycles_in_Boolean_networks","228818136_An_extension_of_a_combinatorial_fixed_point_theorem_of_Shih_and_Dong","223067330_A_combinatorial_analogue_of_the_Jacobian_problem_in_automata_networks"]}
