{"id":"236248292_Improved_Bounds_for_Reduction_to_Depth_4_and_Depth_3","abstract":"Koiran [7] showed that if an n-variate polynomial of degree d (with d = n\nO(1)) is computed by a circuit of size s, then it is also computed by a homogeneous circuit of depth four and of size \\(2^{O(\\sqrt{d}\\log(d)\\log(s))}\\). Using this result, Gupta, Kamath, Kayal and Saptharishi [6] gave an exp \\(\\left(O\\left(\\sqrt{d\\log(d)\\log(n)\\log(s)}\\right)\\right)\\) upper bound for the size of the smallest depth three circuit computing an n-variate polynomial of degree d = n\nO(1) given by a circuit of size s.\nWe improve here Koiran’s bound. Indeed, we show that if we reduce an arithmetic circuit to depth four, then the size becomes exp\\(\\left(O\\left(\\sqrt{d\\log(ds)\\log(n)}\\right)\\right)\\). Mimicking the proof in [6], it also implies the same upper bound for depth three circuits.\nThis new bound is not far from optimal in the sense that Gupta, Kamath, Kayal and Saptharishi [5] also showed a \\(2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{d})}\\) lower bound for the size of homogeneous depth four circuits such that gates at the bottom have fan-in at most \\(\\sqrt{d}\\). Finally, we show that this last lower bound also holds if the fan-in is at least \\(\\sqrt{d}\\).","authors":["Sébastien Tavenas"],"meta":["April 2013Information and Computation 240","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40313-2_71","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["265988558_Completeness_and_Reduction_in_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","220365641_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_survey_of_recent_results_and_open_questions","220365637_Partial_Derivatives_in_Arithmetic_Complexity_and_Beyond","321507343_Completeness_and_Reduction_in_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","261054521_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Three","224354119_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","222825456_Characterizing_Valiant's_algebraic_complexity_classes","222489470_Non-commutative_arithmetic_circuits_Depth_reduction_and_size_lower_bounds","222445041_Feasible_arithmetic_computations_Valiant's_hypothesis","220617287_Fast_Parallel_Computation_of_Polynomials_Using_Few_Processors","45925555_Arithmetic_circuits_The_chasm_at_depth_four_gets_wider"]}
