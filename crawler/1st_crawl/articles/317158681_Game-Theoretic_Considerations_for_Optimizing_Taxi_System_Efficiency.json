{"id":"317158681_Game-Theoretic_Considerations_for_Optimizing_Taxi_System_Efficiency","abstract":"Taxi service is an indispensable part of public transport in modern cities. To support its unique features, a taxi system adopts a decentralized operation mode in which thousands of taxis freely decide their working schedules and routes. Taxis compete with each other for individual profits regardless of system-level efficiency, making the taxi system inefficient and hard to optimize. Most research into the management and economics of taxi markets has focused on modeling from a macro level the effects of and relationships between various market factors. Less has been done regarding a more important component--drivers' strategic behavior under the decentralized operation mode. The authors propose looking at the problem from a game-theoretic perspective. Combining game-theoretic solution concepts with existing models of taxi markets, they model taxi drivers' strategy-making process as a game and transform the problem of optimizing taxi system efficiency into finding a market policy that leads to the desired equilibrium.","authors":["Jiarui Gan","Bo An"],"meta":["May 2017Intelligent Systems, IEEE 32(3):46-52","DOI:10.1109/MIS.2017.55"],"references":["220813478_Sharing_the_Road_Autonomous_Vehicles_Meet_Human_Drivers","220660851_Opportunities_for_multiagent_systems_and_multiagent_reinforcement_learning_in_traffic_control","324421357_The_Strategy_of_Conflict","313129837_The_Strategy_of_Conflict","284127408_Price_regulation_and_optimal_service_standards_The_taxicab_industry","283533091_Optimizing_efficiency_of_taxi_systems_Scaling-up_and_handling_arbitrary_constraints","266994455_Security_and_Game_Theory_Algorithms_Deployed_Systems_Lessons_Learned","262221632_Optimal_pricing_for_improving_efficiency_of_taxi_systems","259018785_MGcc_state_dependent_travel_time_models_and_properties","245558472_Issues_in_Fare_Policy_Case_of_the_New_York_Taxi_Industry","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","229058134_Convex_Optimization","228108275_The_Strategy_of_Conflict","224261712_TaxiSim_A_Multiagent_Simulation_Platform_for_Evaluating_Taxi_Fleet_Operations","223049472_Demand-supply_equilibrium_of_taxi_services_in_a_network_under_competition_and_regulation","222957185_Regulating_taxi_services_in_the_presence_of_congestion_externality","221996242_Nonlinear_pricing_of_taxi_services","220244046_A_Multiperiod_Dynamic_Model_of_Taxi_Services_with_Endogenous_Service_Intensity","24106889_The_Taxicab_Problem_A_Proposed_Solution","4913854_Incremental_discount_policy_for_taxi_fare_with_price-sensitive_demand"]}
