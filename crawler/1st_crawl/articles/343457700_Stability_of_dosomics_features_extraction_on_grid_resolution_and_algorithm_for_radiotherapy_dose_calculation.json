{"id":"343457700_Stability_of_dosomics_features_extraction_on_grid_resolution_and_algorithm_for_radiotherapy_dose_calculation","abstract":"Purpose\nDosomics is a novel texture analysis method to parameterize regions of interest and to produce dose features that encode the spatial and statistical distribution of radiotherapy dose at higher resolution than organ-level dose-volume histograms. This study investigates the stability of dosomics features extraction, as their variation due to changes of grid resolution and algorithm dose calculation.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nDataset has been generated considering all the possible combinations of four grid resolutions and two algorithms dose calculation of 18 clinical delivered dose distributions, leading to a 144 3D dose distributions dataset. Dosomics features extraction has been performed with an in-house developed software. A total number of 214 dosomics features has been extracted from four different region of interest: PTV, the two closest OARs and a RING structure.\nReproducibility and stability of each extracted dosomic feature (Rfe, Sfe), have been analyzed in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation.\n\nResults\nDosomics features extraction was found reproducible (ICC > 0.99). Dosomic features, across the combination of grid resolutions and algorithms dose calculation, are more stable in the RING for all the considered feature’s families. Sfe is higher in OARs, in particular for GLSZM features’ families. Highest Sfe have been found in the PTV, in particular in the GLCM features’ family.\n\nConclusion\nStability and reproducibility of dosomics features have been evaluated for a representative clinical dose distribution case mix. These results suggest that, in terms of stability, dosomic studies should always perform a reporting of grid resolution and algorithm dose calculation.","authors":["L. Placidi","J.
