{"id":"274151176_A_Semantics_of_Poincuts_in_AspectJ","abstract":"In recent years, some researchers have defined many formal semantics for aspect oriented languages. However, only several papers described the semantics of pointcut pipeiing. Unfortunately, these semantics are not complete, independent on software engineering and not easy to be understood by software designers and developers. In this paper, we propose a more simple and complete source-lever formal semantics and give some properties about the function which describes our semantics so as to support the incremental software design process. Our semantics can also deal with seventeen kind poincuts.","authors":["Xie Gang","Yang Bo","Zhang Mingyi"],"meta":["December 2013IERI Procedia 4:323-330","DOI:10.1016/j.ieri.2013.11.046"],"references":["265065131_Report_on_An_Overview_of_AspectJ","220997008_Semantics_of_static_pointcuts_in_AspectJ","314828982_A_semantical_approach_to_method-call_interception","238750489_Irwin_aspect-oriented_programming","236609218_A_Theory_of_Aspects","230629686_Aspect-Oriented_Programming","222708867_rCOS_A_refinement_calculus_of_object_systems","221014829_A_Semantical_Approach_to_Method-Call_Interception","221014700_Pointcuts_and_Advice_in_Higher-Order_Languages","200040519_AspectC_An_Aspect-Oriented_Extension_to_the_C_Programming_Language"]}
