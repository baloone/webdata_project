{"id":"329593306_Serret-Frenet_Frame_and_Curvatures_of_Bezier_Curves","abstract":"The aim of this study is to view the role of Bézier curves in both the Euclidean plane E 2 and Euclidean space E 3 with the help of the fundamental algorithm which is commonly used in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and without this algorithm. The Serret-Frenet elements of non-unit speed curves in the Euclidean plane E 2 and Euclidean space E 3 are given by Gray et al. in 2016. We used these formulas to find Serret-Frenet elements of planar Bézier curve at the end points and for every parameter t. Moreover, we reconstruct these elements for a planar Bézier curve, which is defined by the help of the algorithm based on intermediate points. Finally, in the literature, the spatial Bézier curve only mentioned at the end points, so we improve these elements for all parameters t. Additionally, we calculate these elements for all parameters t using algorithm above mentioned for spatial B.","authors":["Esra Erkan","Salim Yüce"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.3390/math6120321"],"references":["320565068_The_Bishop_Frame_of_Bezier_Curves","318599090_Quintic_trigonometric_Bezier_curve_with_two_shape_parameters","303557196_Approximate_Multidegree_Reduction_of_l_-Bezier_Curves","290973532_Two_Simulated_Annealing_Optimization_Schemas_for_Rational_Bezier_Curve_Fitting_in_the_Presence_of_Noise","283036425_Shape_Modification_for_l_-Bezier_Curves_Based_on_Constrained_Optimization_of_Position_and_Tangent_Vector","273432639_Bezier_Curves_Based_Numerical_Solutions_of_Delay_Systems_with_Inverse_Time","265366049_Applied_Geometry_for_Computer_Graphics_and_CAD","265325842_Handbook_of_Computer_Aided_Geometric_Design","246857904_Modern_Differential_Geometry_of_Curves_and_Surfaces_with_Mathematica","238727646_Curves_and_Surfaces_for_Computer_Aided_Design"]}
