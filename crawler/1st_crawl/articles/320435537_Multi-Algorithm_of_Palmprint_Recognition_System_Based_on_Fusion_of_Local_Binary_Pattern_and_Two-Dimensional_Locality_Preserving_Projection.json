{"id":"320435537_Multi-Algorithm_of_Palmprint_Recognition_System_Based_on_Fusion_of_Local_Binary_Pattern_and_Two-Dimensional_Locality_Preserving_Projection","abstract":"This work based on fusion of multi-algorithm used for palmprint identification system. This piece of work is primary addressing different mechanism like Competitive Valley Hand Detection methods (CHVD) which used for extract Region of Interest (ROI). While in feature extraction the work was divided into three scenarios based on feature extraction like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Two-Dimensional Locality Preserving Projection (2DLPP) and fusion of LBP+2DLPP.The experimental results show that fusion of LBP and 2DLPP give the best result with high accuracy reach to 98.55% which improve by 1.22% and 2.85% for LBP and 2DLPP respectively when they are applied separately.","authors":["Mouad M.H.
