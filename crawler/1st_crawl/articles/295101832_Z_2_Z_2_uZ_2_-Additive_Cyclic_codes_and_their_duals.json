The generators for these codes are obtained and a minimal spanning set is determined for even and odd [Formula: see text] separately with arbitrary [Formula: see text]. We also determine the generators of duals of the [Formula: see text]-additive cyclic codes for odd [Formula: see text]. A necessary condition for a 1-generator [Formula: see text]-cyclic code to be a [Formula: see text]-free module is obtained.","authors":["Srinivasulu B.","Maheshanand Bhaintwal"],"meta":["February 2016Discrete Mathematics Algorithms and Applications 08(02)","DOI:10.1142/S1793830916500270"],"references":["278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","271665682_On_Z_2_Z_2_u_-additive_codes","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","3079781_Cyclic_codes_and_self-dual_codes_over_F2uF2","3078458_The_Z4-linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_related_codes","256711151_One_generator_quasi-cyclic_codes_over_F2uF2F2uF2","242917452_On_quasi-cyclic_codes_over_mathbbZ_q","225163313_Cyclic_codes_over_the_rings_Z2_uZ2_and_Z2_uZ2_u2Z2","220685724_Association_Schemes_and_Coding_Theory","3080308_Maximum_distance_codes_over_rings_of_order_4"]}
