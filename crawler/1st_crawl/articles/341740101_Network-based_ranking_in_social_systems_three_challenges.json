{"id":"341740101_Network-based_ranking_in_social_systems_three_challenges","abstract":"Ranking algorithms are pervasive in our increasingly digitized societies, with important real-world applications including recommender systems, search engines, and influencer marketing practices. From a network science perspective, network-based ranking algorithms solve fundamental problems related to the identification of vital nodes for the stability and dynamics of a complex system. Despite the ubiquitous and successful applications of these algorithms, we argue that our understanding of their performance and their applications to real-world problems face three fundamental challenges: (1) rankings might be biased by various factors; (2) their effectiveness might be limited to specific problems; and (3) agents’ decisions driven by rankings might result inpotentially vicious feedback mechanisms and unhealthy systemic consequences. Methods rooted innetwork science and agent-based modeling can help us to understand and overcome these challenges.","authors":["Manuel Sebastian Mariani","Linyuan Lü"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Physics Complexity 1(1):011001","DOI:10.1088/2632-072X/ab8a61"],"references":["345464265_Climb_or_Jump_Status-Based_Seeding_in_User-Generated_Content_Networks","338998132_Bias_in_data-driven_artificial_intelligence_systems-An_introductory_survey","337062210_Don't_follow_the_leader_how_ranking_performance_reduces_meritocracy","333475359_Reciprocity_and_impact_in_academic_careers","333410741_Nestedness_in_complex_networks_Observation_emergence_and_implications","332939100_Climb_or_Jump_Status-Based_Seeding_in_User-Generated_Content_Networks","347834791_Fairness_is_not_static_deeper_understanding_of_long_term_fairness_via_simulation_studies","344790120_Complex_Adaptive_Systems_An_Introduction_to_Computational_Models_of_Social_Life_An_Introduction_to_Computational_Models_of_Social_Life","339427596_Unbiased_evaluation_of_ranking_metrics_reveals_consistent_performance_in_science_and_technology_citation_data","337764942_Recommending_investors_for_new_startups_by_integrating_network_diffusion_and_investors'_domain_preference"]}
