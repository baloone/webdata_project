{"id":"316574789_The_influence_of_motivational_orientation_on_the_satisfaction_of_university_students","abstract":"A common finding in the area of motivation and psychological well-being is that internally motivated individuals exhibit greater levels of happiness than externally motivated individuals. In this paper we answer the question of whether internally or seemingly externally motivated students report higher levels of satisfaction than individuals who are conflicted in their motivations or are amotivated. We show that both seemingly externally motivated individuals and internally motivated individuals report higher levels of happiness than non-motivated individuals or individuals who are conflicted in theirmotivations. These findings are consistent with self-determination theory. These findings are important in recognizing that well internalized external motivations are likely not detrimental to the well-being of undergraduate college students. Aspirations which are consistent, regardless of whether they are internal or seemingly external likely result in higher levels of happiness among university students.","authors":["Clifford Nowell"],"meta":["April 2017Teaching in Higher Education 22(4):1-12","DOI:10.1080/13562517.2017.1319811"],"references":["280764831_Psychological_and_Environmental_Correlates_of_Well-being_Among_Undergraduate_University_Students","248966830_The_significance_of_motivation_in_student-centred_learning_a_reflective_case_study","242692109_A_survey_research_of_satisfaction_levels_of_graduate_students_enrolled_in_a_nationally_ranked_top-10_program_at_a_mid-western_university","226962399_Quality_of_College_Life_QCL_of_Students_Developing_and_Validating_a_Measure_of_Well-Being","225713192_Income_Motivation_and_Satisfaction_with_Life_An_Empirical_Analysis","225331655_Motivation_for_and_commitment_to_social_values_The_roles_of_age_and_gender","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","269599794_Therapist's_Autonomy_Support_and_Patient's_Self-Criticism_Predict_Motivation_during_Brief_Treatments_for_Depression","257589373_Psychological_Hardiness_in_Learning_and_Quality_of_College_Life_of_Business_Students_Evidence_from_Vietnam","246276634_Further_Examining_the_American_Dream_Differential_Correlates_of_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Goals","233896840_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","233479765_Evidence_for_the_impact_of_assessment_on_mood_and_motivation_in_first-year_students","232886744_'Your_thrust_is_to_understand'_-_how_academically_successful_students_learn","232441581_Favoriser_la_motivation_optimale_et_la_sant_mentale_dans_les_divers_milieux_de_vie_Facilitating_optimal_motivation_and_psychological_well-being_across_life's_domains","226662524_Intrinsic_Extrinsic_and_Amotivational_Orientations_Their_Role_in_University_Adjustment_Stress_Well-Being_and_Subsequent_Academic_Performance","226009984_Subjective_Well-Being_Among_College_Students","222645667_Do_We_Really_Know_What_Makes_Us_Happy_A_Review_of_the_Economic_Literature_on_the_Factors_Associated_With_Subjective_Well-Being","216743170_The_What_and_Why_of_Goal_Pursuits_Human_Needs_and_the_Self-Determination_of_Behavior","44837057_Does_One_Size_Fit_All_University_Differences_in_the_Influence_of_Wages_Financial_Aid_and_Integration_on_Student_Retention","23978311_Do_Higher_Grades_Lead_to_Favorable_Student_Evaluations","4932201_The_Impact_of_Relative_Grade_Expectations_on_Student_Evaluation_of_Teaching"]}
