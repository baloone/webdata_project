{"id":"326009476_Optical_Character_Recognition_using_Deep_learning_-_A_Technical_Review","abstract":"OCR is used to identify the character from human written text. To recognize the text segmentation of character is important stage. So here, we addressed different techniques to recognize the character. This document also presents comparison of different languages for character and numeral recognition with its accuracy achieved by different writer. Segmentation problem of each language were different also handwritten character was also varied user to user, so it is necessary to make OCR systems more effective and accurate for segmentation. Comparative study concludes that deep learning technique gives good segmentation and gives better result in case with large dataset compares to other techniques.","authors":["Preeti Bhatt","Isha Patel"],"meta":["June 2018"],"references":["316350087_Handwriting_Recognition_on_Form_Document_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Support_Vector_Machines_CNN-SVM","313764004_Handwritten_Arabic_Numeral_Recognition_using_Deep_Learning_Neural_Networks","304406868_Deep_learning_based_large_scale_handwritten_Devanagari_character_recognition","321029318_Investigation_on_Deep_Learning_for_Off-line_Handwritten_Arabic_Character_Recognition","311250264_A_survey_on_offline_handwritten_north_Indian_script_symbol_recognition"]}
