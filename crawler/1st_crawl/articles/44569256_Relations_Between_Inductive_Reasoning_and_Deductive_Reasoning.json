{"id":"44569256_Relations_Between_Inductive_Reasoning_and_Deductive_Reasoning","abstract":"One of the most important open questions in reasoning research is how inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning are related. In an effort to address this question, we applied methods and concepts from memory research. We used 2 experiments to examine the effects of logical validity and premise-conclusion similarity on evaluation of arguments. Experiment 1 showed 2 dissociations: For a common set of arguments, deduction judgments were more affected by validity, and induction judgments were more affected by similarity. Moreover, Experiment 2 showed that fast deduction judgments were like induction judgments-in terms of being more influenced by similarity and less influenced by validity, compared with slow deduction judgments. These novel results pose challenges for a 1-process account of reasoning and are interpreted in terms of a 2-process account of reasoning, which was implemented as a multidimensional signal detection model and applied to receiver operating characteristic data.","authors":["Evan Heit","Caren M Rotello"],"meta":["May 2010Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning Memory and Cognition 36(3):805-12","DOI:10.1037/a0018784","SourcePubMed"],"references":["232455061_Category-Based_Induction","232440804_Induction_deduction_and_argument_strength_in_human_reasoning_and_argumentation","51314373_Categorical_Inference_Is_Not_a_Tree_The_Myth_of_Inheritance_Hierarchies","45364493_Assessing_the_Belief_Bias_Effect_With_ROCs_It's_a_Response_Bias_Effect","15160609_Mental_models_and_probabilistic_thinking","8458218_Sum-Difference_Theory_of_Remembering_and_Knowing_A_Two-Dimensional_Signal-Detection_Model","8147027_In_defense_of_the_signal_detection_interpretation_of_RememberKnow_judgments","7676909_Relations_between_premise_similarity_and_inductive_strength","7254325_The_role_of_similarity_in_deductive_categorical_inference","5760747_Effects_of_Time_Pressure_on_Context-Sensitive_Property_Induction","2825253_Feature-Based_Induction","346672780_Reasoning_Meaning_and_Mind","312434936_Choice_and_Chance_An_Introduction_to_Inductive_Logic","287251609_What_intelligence_tests_miss_The_psychology_of_rational_thought","285821126_Are_there_two_kinds_of_reasoninga","284756415_What_is_induction_and_why_study_it","279398539_Commonsense_Reasoning_Logic_and_Human_Rationality","270261654_Choice_and_Chance_An_Introduction_to_Inductive_Logic","247515602_Rapid_responding_increases_belief_bias_Evidence_for_the_dual-process_theory_of_reasoning","234021438_Applied_Multiple_RegressionCorrelation_Analysis_For_The_Behavioral_Sciences","232535330_Memory_and_Consciousness","231513975_Detection_Theory_A_User's_Guide","228853135_Modeling_two_kinds_of_reasoning","223087112_Inductive_Judgments_about_Natural_Categories","26747133_Modeling_the_Effects_of_Argument_Length_and_Validity_on_Inductive_and_Deductive_Reasoning","19533174_Toward_a_Universal_Law_of_Generalization_for_Psychological_Science","11996125_Two_Kinds_of_Reasoning","11324504_Generalization_similarity_and_Bayesian_inference","5693721_Dual-Processing_Accounts_of_Reasoning_Judgment_and_Social_Cognition","5479380_Type_I_error_rates_and_power_analyses_for_single-point_sensitivity_measures","2804592_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Forms_of_Inductive_Reasoning"]}
