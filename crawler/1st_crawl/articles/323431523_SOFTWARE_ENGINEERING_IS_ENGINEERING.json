{"id":"323431523_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_IS_ENGINEERING","abstract":"Software engineering implies an orderliness to the design and implementation of computer software. It also implies that the results will meet certain quality, performance, and cost objectives analogous to those traditionally set in the more classical engineering disciplines. A considerable body of knowledge and methods common to the traditional areas of engineering is also applicable to software engineering. It is argued that general engineering methods will be more readily applied in the development of software when software engineering is recognized as a legitimate engineering displine with its own educational cirriculum.","authors":["S.
