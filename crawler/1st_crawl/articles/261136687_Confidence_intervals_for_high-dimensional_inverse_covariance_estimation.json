{"id":"261136687_Confidence_intervals_for_high-dimensional_inverse_covariance_estimation","abstract":"In this paper, we establish confidence intervals for individual parameters of\na sparse concentration matrix in a high-dimensional setting. We follow the idea\nof the projection approach proposed in \\cite{vdgeer13}, which is applied to the\ngraphical Lasso to obtain a de-sparsified estimator. Subsequently, we analyze\nthe asymptotic properties of the novel estimator, establishing asymptotic\nnormality and confidence intervals for the case of sub-Gaussian observations.\nPerformance of the proposed method is illustrated in a simulation study.","authors":["Jana Jankova","Sara van de Geer"],"meta":["March 2014Electronic Journal of Statistics 9","DOI:10.1214/15-EJS1031","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256981584_Asymptotic_Normality_and_Optimalities_in_Estimation_of_Large_Gaussian_Graphical_Model","254211576_High-dimensional_covariance_estimation_by_minimizing_-penalized_log-determinant_divergence","235766066_On_Asymptotically_Optimal_Confidence_Regions_and_Tests_for_High-Dimensional_Models","48207040_A_Constrained_L1_Minimization_Approach_to_Sparse_Precision_Matrix_Estimation","47397135_A_Unified_Framework_for_High-Dimensional_Analysis_of_M-Estimators_with_Decomposable_Regularizers","46587998_Square-Root_Lasso_Pivotal_Recovery_of_Sparse_Signals_via_ConicProgramming","23418923_p_-Values_for_High-Dimensional_Regression","5769720_Sparse_inverse_covariance_estimation_with_the_graphical_LASSO","5207515_Model_selection_and_estimation_in_the_Gaussian_graphical_model","2136016_Can_One_Estimate_the_Conditional_Distribution_of_Post-Model-Selection_Estimators","2131597_First-Order_Methods_for_Sparse_Covariance_Selection","1909130_Sparse_permutation_invariant_covariance","261182063_Worst_possible_sub-directions_in_high-dimensional_models","256548837_Assumption-free_confidence_intervals_for_groups_of_variables_in_sparse_high-dimensional_regression","247153153_Rates_of_convergence_of_the_Adaptive_LASSO_estimators_to_the_Oracle_distribution_and_higher_order_refinements_by_the_bootstrap","237197960_Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Regression","237053936_Valid_Post-Selection_Inference","236597283_Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition","230815067_Confidence_Sets_in_Sparse_Regression","227369373_Bootstrapping_Lasso_Estimators","220320861_High_Dimensional_Inverse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_via_Linear_Programming","51969053_Inference_on_Treatment_Effects_After_Selection_Among_High-Dimensional_Controls","51944377_Confidence_Intervals_for_Low-Dimensional_Parameters_in_High-DimensionalLinear_Models","38348265_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Largest_Eigenvalue_in_Principal_Components_Analysis","26841212_High_Dimensional_Variable_Selection","23564916_Model_Selection_and_Inference_Facts_and_Fiction","1914983_Regularized_estimation_of_large_covariance_matrices"]}
