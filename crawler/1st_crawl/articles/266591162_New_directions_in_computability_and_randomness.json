Mostly, these classes are lowness properties (saying the set is close to computable), such as being K-trivial, or strongly jump traceable. Cost functions help a lot to understand the following results: • Each K-trivial set is Turing below a c.e. K-trivial set (Nies). • Each null Σ 0 3 class of ML-random sets has a simple Turing lower bound. Moreover, this lower bound is obtained via an injury-free construction (Hirschfeldt, Miller). • Each strongly jump traceable c.e. set is Turing below each ω-c.e. ML-random set (Greenberg, Nies).","authors":["André Nies"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199230761.001.0001"],"references":["284090758_On_the_symmetry_of_algorithmic_information","268019688_Turing_incomparability_in_Scott_sets","291168505_A_class_of_incomplete_sets","285855503_On_autoreducibility","281256105_A_refinement_of_lown_and_highn_for_the_re_degrees","279542543_A_basis_theorem_for_II10_classes_of_positive_measure_and_jump_inversion_for_random_reals","269000444_On_the_Role_of_O'_in_Recursion_Theory","268770738_Relationships_Between_Reducibilities","266556322_Simple_Proofs_of_Some_Theorems_on_High_Degrees_of_Unsolvability","266221518_On_the_use_of_Diagonally_Nonrecursive_Functions"]}
