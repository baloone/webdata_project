{"id":"312550604_The_Number_of_Realizations_of_a_Laman_Graph","abstract":"Laman graphs model planar frameworks that are rigid for a general choice of distances between the vertices. There are finitely many ways, up to isometries, to realize a Laman graph in the plane. Such realizations can be seen as solutions of systems of quadratic equations prescribing the distances between pairs of points. Using ideas from algebraic and tropical geometry, we provide a recursion formula for the number of complex solutions of such systems.","authors":["Jose Capco","Matteo Gallet","Georg Grasegger","Christoph Koutschan"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry 2(1)","DOI:10.1137/17M1118312"],"references":["259499459_Frameworks_with_crystallographic_symmetry","228808666_The_Stewart-Gough_Platform_of_General_Geometry_can_have_40_Real_Postures","222112814_The_number_of_equivalent_realisations_of_a_rigid_graph","221557244_Algebraic_Methods_for_Counting_Euclidean_Embeddings_of_Rigid_Graphs","210232152_On_Generic_Rigidity_in_the_Plane","2853944_The_Number_of_Embeddings_of_Minimally_Rigid_Graphs","2596144_Computer_Algebra_Methods_for_Studying_and_Computing_Molecular_Conformations","321499956_Using_Algebraic_Geometry","319394668_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","268948697_Die_graphische_Statik_der_starren_Korper","265366038_Using_Algebraic_Geometry","260030948_On_the_Number_of_Realizations_of_Certain_Henneberg_Graphs_arising_in_Protein_Conformation","254887742_Mixed_Volume_and_Distance_Geometry_Techniques_for_Counting_Euclidean_Embeddings_of_Rigid_Graphs","239329255_A_network_theory_approach_to_the_rigidity_of_skeletal_structures","238834510_Solving_large_systems_of_polynomial_equations_using_REDUCE","228445328_Introduction_to_tropical_algebraic_geometry","227640562_Protein_Flexibility_Predictions_Using_Graph_Theory","225147318_FGb_A_Library_for_Computing_Grobner_Bases","223142653_Combinatorial_classes_of_parallel_manipulators","222511832_Mixed_Volume_Techniques_for_Embeddings_of_Laman_Graphs","222181439_An_Algorithm_for_Two-Dimensional_Rigidity_Percolation_The_Pebble_Game","220983340_Certifying_and_constructing_minimally_rigid_graphs_in_the_plane","210232119_On_graphs_and_of_plane_skeletal_structures","29600596_On_the_generic_rigidity_of_plane_frameworks","2643149_Stewart_Platforms_Without_Computer","2110401_Enumerative_tropical_algebraic_geometry_in_R2","1906986_Towards_an_optimal_algorithm_for_recognizing_Laman_graphs"]}
