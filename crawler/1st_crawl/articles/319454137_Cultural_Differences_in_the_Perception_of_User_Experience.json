{"id":"319454137_Cultural_Differences_in_the_Perception_of_User_Experience","abstract":"Many products are developed for an international audience. But product design is typically done by a small group of designers, which is often homogeneous concerning their cultural background. In addition, the adaption of products to different cultural contexts is an expensive exercise and is thus in most cases not even considered in the product planning. Currently not much is known on the influence of cultural aspects on the interaction design of products, since doing empirical research in this area is quite difficult. We investigate how Indonesian and German students judge common products concerning their user experience. We present some first results and possible explanations of the detected differences.","authors":["Harry B.
