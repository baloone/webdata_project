{"id":"260062450_Symblicit_algorithms_for_mean-payoff_and_shortest_path_in_monotonic_Markov_decision_processes","abstract":"When treating Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large state spaces, using\nexplicit representations quickly becomes unfeasible. Lately, Wimmer et al. have\nproposed a so-called symblicit algorithm for the expected mean-payoff in MDPs,\nbased on the strategy iteration algorithm of Howard and Veinott. This algorithm\nefficiently combines symbolic and explicit data structures, and uses binary\ndecision diagrams as symbolic representation. The aim of this paper is to show\nthat the new data structure of pseudo-antichains (an extension of antichains)\nprovides another interesting alternative, especially for the class of monotonic\nMDPs. We design efficient pseudo-antichain based symblicit algorithms (with\nopen source implementations) for two quantitative settings: the expected\nmean-payoff and the stochastic shortest path. For two practical applications\ncoming from automated planning and LTL synthesis, we report promising\nexperimental results w.r.t. both the run time and the memory consumption.","authors":["Aaron Bohy","Véronique Bruyère","Jean-Francois Raskin"],"meta":["September 2017Acta Informatica 54(6)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-016-0255-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","315451446_Compassion_Caring_and_Communication_Skills_for_Nursing_Practice_Compassion_Caring_and_Communication_Skills_for_Nursing_Practice","313628527_Antichains_A_new_algorithm_for_checking_universality_of_finite_automata","305974693_Exact_and_ordinary_lumpability_in_finite_Markov_chains","286030444_MODEST_-_A_unified_language_for_quantitative_models","284528176_Finite_Markov_Chains","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","269501855_Dynamic_Programming_and_Markov_Processes","266066629_Competitive_Markov_Decision_Processes"]}
