{"id":"331518537_When_will_we_have_a_quantum_computer","abstract":"- A classical computer with N bits at any given moment is in one of its possible 2N states. - In contrast, the state of the hypothetical quantum computer with N qubits is defined by the values of 2N continuous parameters, the quantum amplitudes. - To beat your laptop in performing some special tasks, like factoring very large numbers, one needs ∼1000 qubits. - Accordingly, the number of continuous variables that should be under our control is at least 21000 ∼ 10300. - Thus the answer to the question in the title is: as soon as physicists and engineers will learn to control thus number of degrees of freedom, which means NEVER.","authors":["Michel I Dyakonov"],"meta":["March 2019Solid-State Electronics 155","DOI:10.1016/j.sse.2019.03.004","Project: Scepticism on quantum computing"],"references":["323597968_Observation_of_topological_phenomena_in_a_programmable_lattice_of_1800_qubits","2199638_Is_Fault-Tolerant_Quantum_Computation_Really_Possible"]}
