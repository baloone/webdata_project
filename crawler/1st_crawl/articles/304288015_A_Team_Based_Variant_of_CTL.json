{"id":"304288015_A_Team_Based_Variant_of_CTL","abstract":"We introduce two variants of computation tree logic CTL based on team semantics: an asynchronous one and a synchronous one. For both variants we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability as well as the model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete. Here it does not matter which of the two semantics are considered. For model checking we prove a PSPACE-completeess for the synchronous case, and show P-completeness for the asynchronous case. Furthermore we prove several interesting fundamental properties of both semantics.","authors":["Andreas Krebs","Arne Meier","Jonni Virtema"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1109/TIME.2015.11","Conference: 2015 22nd International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME)"],"references":["272489641_Weak_models_of_distributed_computing_with_connections_to_modal_logic","265973833_Extended_modal_dependence_logic_EMDL","263390385_The_Expressive_Power_of_Modal_Dependence_Logic","263390378_Complexity_of_validity_for_propositional_dependence_logics","261289259_Modal_Independence_Logic","254919109_Modal_dependence_logic","234807189_Automatic_Verification_of_Finite_State_Concurrent_Systems_Using_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","229031660_Multi-Modal_CTL_Completeness_Complexity_and_an_Application","220432530_An_Automata-Theoretic_Approach_to_Branching-Time_Model_Checking","220202587_Constructive_knowledge_What_agents_can_achieve_under_imperfect_information","220180643_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_for_Fragments_of_CTL_and_CTL","50853630_Model_Checking_CTL_is_Almost_Always_Inherently_Sequential","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","275870105_Time_and_Modality","266592690_Semantical_Considerations_on_Modal_Logic","245882082_Design_and_verication_of_synchronous_skeletons_using_branching_time_temporal_logic","237132002_The_design_and_synthesis_of_synchronization_skeletons_using_temporal_logic","222459053_The_polynomial_hierarchy","222261262_Decision_Procedures_and_Expressiveness_in_the_Temporal_Logic_of_Branching_Time","222220406_A_near-optimal_method_for_reasoning_about_action","220693075_Introduction_to_circuit_complexity_-_a_uniform_approach","220692648_Descriptive_Complexity","220617266_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Provability_in_Systems_of_Modal_Propositional_Logic","220575001_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Regular_Programs","4354738_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Programs","2806687_Compositional_Semantics_for_a_Language_of_Imperfect_Information","2540396_The_Complexity_of_Temporal_Logic_Model_Checking","2486024_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2441671_Expressibility_And_Parallel_Complexity"]}
