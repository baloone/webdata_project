{"id":"285775512_Orchestrating_learning_in_a_one-to-one_technology_classroom","abstract":"One-to-one technology classrooms equip each child with a computing device that provides personalised learning tools. One-to-one learning is showing promise in classrooms due to support for individual and small group learning through the affordances of mobile learning devices such as portability, low cost and communication features. However, there are problems of management of the technology-enabled classroom, lack of support for collaborative and whole class working, design of lessons that switch easily between activities, and difficulty in re-use of lesson components. In this chapter we describe the SceDer system to orchestrate learning with one-to-one technologies. Sceder provides an authoring system for teachers to design lessons, an interchange language (COML) to describe lesson sequences and resources, and a delivery system that enables the teacher to manage collaborative one-to-one learning in the classroom. The system has been tested in school classrooms and has demonstrated its effectiveness in managing fluid transitions between individual, group, and whole class learning activities.","authors":["J.
