{"id":"265473385_Antenna-integrated_06_THz_FET_direct_detectors_based_on_CVD_graphene","abstract":"We present terahertz (THz) detectors based on top-gated graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) with integrated split-bow-tie antennas. The GFETs were fabricated using graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The THz detectors are capable of room-temperature rectification of a 0.6 THz signal and achieve a maximum optical responsivity better than 14 V/W and minimum optical noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 515 pW/Hz^0.5. Our results are a significant improvement over previous work on graphene direct detectors and are comparable to other established direct detector technologies. This is the first time room-temperature direct detection has been demonstrated using CVD graphene, which introduces the potential for scalable, wafer-level production of graphene detectors.","authors":["Audrey Rose Zak","Michael Andersson","Maris Bauer","Jonas Matukas"],"meta":["September 2014Nano Letters 14(10)","DOI:10.1021/nl5027309","SourcePubMed"],"references":["262993938_Microwave_noise_characterization_of_graphene_field_effect_transistors","259427108_Graphene_materials_and_devices_in_terahertz_science_and_technology","259298127_High_performance_bilayer-graphene_Terahertz_detectors","257949811_High-responsivity_low-noise_room-temperature_self-mixing_terahertz_detector_realized_using_floating_antennas_on_a_GaN-based_field-effect_transistor","254057332_A_large-signal_graphene_FET_model","254056322_CMOS_Integrated_Antenna-Coupled_Field-Effect_Transistors_for_the_Detection_of_Radiation_From_02_to_43_THz","237150167_Low_Partial_Pressure_Chemical_Vapor_Deposition_of_Graphene_on_Copper","235674790_Frame_Assisted_H2O_Electrolysis_Induced_H2_Bubbling_Transfer_of_Large_Area_Graphene_Grown_by_Chemical_Vapor_Deposition_on_Cu","234851701_Terahertz_responsivity_of_field_effect_transistors_versus_their_static_channel_conductivity_and_loading_effects","232417178_Cutting-edge_THz_technology","231068572_THz_imaging_and_sensing_for_security_applications_-_Explosives_weapons_and_drugs","230825947_Graphene_field_effect_transistors_as_room-temperature_Terahertz_detectors","224407252_Realization_of_a_High_Mobility_Dual-gated_Graphene_Field_Effect_Transistor_with_Al2O3_Dielectric","45862269_Field_Effect_Transistors_for_Terahertz_Detection_Physics_and_First_Imaging_Applications","45800252_Boron_Nitride_Substrates_for_High-Quality_Graphene_Electronics","23316149_Temperature-Dependent_Transport_in_Suspended_Graphene","13235082_Shallow_water_analogy_for_a_ballistic_field_effect_transistor_New_mechanism_of_plasma_wave_generation_by_dc_current","3062521_Detection_mixing_and_frequency_multiplication_of_terahertz_radiation_by_two-dimensional_electronic_fluid","1763893_The_electronic_properties_of_graphene","264393335_Antenna-coupled_field-effect_transistors_for_multi-spectral_terahertz_imaging_up_to_425_THz","261460775_Bow-tie-antenna-coupled_terahertz_detectors_using_AlGaNGaN_field-effect_transistors_with_025_micrometer_gate_length","261274372_Fast_room_temperature_THz_bolometers","260700904_Plasmonic_and_bolometric_terahertz_detection_by_graphene_field-effect_transistor","260497709_Graphene_Transistors_Status_Prospects_and_Problems","260333326_A_30-GHz_Integrated_Subharmonic_Mixer_Based_on_a_Multichannel_Graphene_FET","258649714_Graphene_FET-Based_Zero-Bias_RF_to_Millimeter-Wave_Detection","257299240_Photocurrent-Based_detection_of_Terahertz_radiation_in_graphene","244989570_Theory_of_the_plasma-wave_photoresponse_of_a_gated_graphene_sheet","243708183_Observation_of_Anderson_Localization_in_an_Electron_Gas","239663477_Terahertz_Plasma_Waves_in_Gated_Graphene_Heterostructures","235657581_Record_Maximum_Oscillation_Frequency_in_C-Face_Epitaxial_Graphene_Transistors","224916290_State-of-the-Art_Graphene_High-Frequency_Electronics","224506099_Rational_Design_of_High-Responsivity_Detectors_of_Terahertz_Radiation_Based_on_Distributed_Self-Mixing_in_Silicon_Field-Effect_Transistors","224161792_A_Broadband_Quasi-Optical_Terahertz_Detector_Utilizing_a_Zero_Bias_Schottky_Diode","47674991_Hysteresis_of_Electronic_Transport_in_Graphene_Transistors","44670232_Technical_Note_Terahertz_Imaging_of_Ancient_Mummies_and_Bone","40805058_Photo-Thermoelectric_Effect_at_a_Graphene_Interface_Junction","24358369_Thermoelectric_and_Magnetothermoelectric_Transport_Measurements_of_Graphene","8218170_Electric_Field_Effect_in_Atomically_Thin_Carbon_Films","3130643_Terahertz_technology_in_biology_and_medicine_IEEE_Trans_Microw_Theory_Tech","3019381_Standoff_Detection_of_Weapons_and_Contraband_in_the_100_GHz_to_1_THz_Region"]}
