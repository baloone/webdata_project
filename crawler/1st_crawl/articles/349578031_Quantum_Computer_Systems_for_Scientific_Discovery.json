{"id":"349578031_Quantum_Computer_Systems_for_Scientific_Discovery","abstract":"The great promise of quantum computers comes with the dual challenges of building them and finding their useful applications. We argue that these two challenges should be considered together, by codesigning full-stack quantum computer systems along with their applications in order to hasten their development and potential for scientific discovery. In this context, we identify scientific and community needs, opportunities, a sampling of a few use case studies, and significant challenges for the development of quantum computers for science over the next 2–10 years. This document is written by a community of university, national laboratory, and industrial researchers in the field of Quantum Information Science and Technology, and is based on a summary from a U.S. National Science Foundation workshop on Quantum Computing held on October 21–22, 2019 in Alexandria, VA.","authors":["Yuri Alexeev","Dave Bacon","Kenneth R.
