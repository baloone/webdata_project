{"id":"330819586_ESTIMATING_THE_CAUSAL_EFFECT_OF_A_TEACHER_TRAINING_PROGRAM_ON_ADVANCED_PLACEMENTR_OUTCOMES","abstract":"This study employs a potential outcomes modeling approach to estimate the causal effect of Code.orgâ€™s Professional Learning Program on Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles test taking and qualifying score earned for a recent cohort of 167 schools compared to a matched group of comparison schools. Results indicate substantial and significant increases in both Computer Science AP test taking and qualifying score earning for all students. In addition, the significant effects were even greater for Computer Science AP test taking and qualifying score earned by female and minority students when impact ratios are analyzed separately. This study provides evidence of a teacher training program that is having a significant and important impact on preparing more students to succeed in computer science and improve the future of computer science education in this country.Keywords: computer science, professional development, teacher training","authors":["Richard Brown","Emily Anne Brown"],"meta":["February 2019International Journal of Computer Science Education in Schools 2(4):3","DOI:10.21585/ijcses.v2i4.35"],"references":["276102678_The_Statistics_of_Causal_Inference_A_View_from_Political_Methodology_Fig_1","267852486_AP_R_Students_in_College_An_Analysis_of_Five-Year_Academic_Careers","327252722_Anatomy_of_an_Enduring_Gender_Gap_The_Evolution_of_Women's_Participation_in_Computer_Science","323377848_Matching_Using_Estimated_Propensity_Scores_Relating_Theory_to_Practice","298785875_Twang_Toolkit_for_Weighting_and_Analysis_of_Nonequivalent_Groups_R_Package_Version_10-1","285789255_The_Design_versus_Analysis_of_Observational_Studies_for_Casual_Effects_Parallels_with_the_Design_of_Randomized_Trials","267720969_College_Outcomes_Comparisons_by_AP_R_and_Non-AP_High_School_Experiences","267207791_A_Comparison_of_College_Performance_of_Matched_AP_R_and_Non-AP_Student_Groups","265352649_Causality_Models_reasoning_and_inference_second_edition","264957254_Statistics_and_Causal_Inference"]}
