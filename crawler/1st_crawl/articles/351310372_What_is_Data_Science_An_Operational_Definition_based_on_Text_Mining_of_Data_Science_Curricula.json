This study adopts a bottom-up approach to understand what data science is by analyzing the descriptions of courses offered by the data science programs in the United States. Through topic modeling, 14 topics are identified from the current curricula of 56 data science programs. These topics reiterate that data science is at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and substantive fields.","authors":["Zhiyong Zhang"],"meta":["May 2021","DOI:10.35566/jbds/v1n1/p1"],"references":["344673148_Text_Preprocessing_for_Text_Mining_in_Organizational_Research_Review_and_Recommendations_In-press_at_Organizational_Research_Methods","339529230_Preprocessing_Techniques_for_Text_Mining_-_An_Overview","336150257_SOCIOLOGY_OF_SCIENCE_AND_PREDICTION","283607831_Benchmarking_Academic_Programs_in_Business_Analytics","282692841_Big_data_and_data_science_What_should_we_teach","321927669_50_Years_of_Data_Science","301404668_A_Method_of_Accounting_Bigrams_in_Topic_Models","290507248_Knowledge_Skills_and_Abilities_for_Entry-Level_Business_Analytics_Positions_A_Multi-Method_Study","285969195_Text_mining_Classification_clustering_and_applications","266450427_What_is_Data_Science_Fundamental_Concepts_and_a_Heuristic_Example"]}
