{"id":"281312108_Algorithmic_homeomorphism_of_3-manifolds_as_a_corollary_of_geometrization","abstract":"We prove the folklore corollary of the geometrization theorem that there is\nan algorithm for the homeomorphism problem for closed, oriented, triangulated\n3-manifolds. To support the interpretation of this result as a corollary of\ngeometrization, we give a self-contained proof that uses only the statement of\nthe geometrization theorem, standard moves on triangulations, hyperbolic\ntriangulations, and old results from computability theory. We make no use of\nmore advanced algorithmic methods from geometric group theory or normal surface\ntheory, nor any of Thurston's or Perelman's methods used to prove\ngeometrization. We also give variations of several steps of the algorithm and\nproof.\nIn a second result, we combine normal surface theory results with hyperbolic\ntriangulations to prove that the homeomorphism problem is elementary recursive.","authors":["Greg Kuperberg"],"meta":["August 2015Pacific Journal of Mathematics 301(1)","DOI:10.2140/pjm.2019.301.189","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263776658_Infinitesimal_rigidity_of_smooth_convex_surfaces_through_the_second_derivative_of_the_Hilbert-Einstein_functional","255979572_Computational_Complexity_in_Polynomial_Algebra","247048681_On_the_triangulation_of_manifolds_and_the_Hauptvermutung","246404781_Hyperbolic_Manifolds_and_Discrete_Groups","242529283_Algorithms_for_the_complete_decomposition_of_a_closed_3-manifold","228589561_Algorithms_for_essential_surfaces_in_3-manifolds","51893344_Infinitesimal_Rigidity_of_Convex_Polyhedra_through_the_Second_Derivative_of_the_Hilbert-Einstein_Functional","2102303_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Knot_Genus_and_Spanning_Area","292810771_On_the_foundations_of_combinatory_analysis_situs","284696009_The_virtual_Haken_conjecture","281761074_Essays_in_Group_Theory","266010801_A_Lower_Bound_for_the_Volume_of_Hyperbolic_3-Manifolds","265542044_Word_Processing_in_Groups","265360667_Ricci_flow_and_geometrization_of_3-manifolds","264956314_A_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra_and_Geometry","264953339_Non-zero_degree_maps_and_surface_bundles_over_S_1","262641073_Decision_problems_for_3-manifolds_and_their_fundamental_groups","247921715_The_Isomorphism_Problem_for_Hyperbolic_Groups_I","246320901_Geschlossene_Flachen_in_dreidimensionalen_Mannigfaltigkeiten","245277259_An_Algorithm_to_Recognise_Small_Seifert_Fiber_Spaces","243719841_Homotopy_Equivalences_of_3-Manifolds_with_Boundaries","243658990_Lectures_on_Three-manifold_Topology","243657959_Seifert_bered_spaces_in_3-manifolds","243557947_A_New_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra","242453390_Simplifying_triangulations_of_S-3","240461312_PL_Homeomorphic_Manifolds_are_Equivalent_by_Elementary_Shellings","240402066_Volumes_of_hyperbolic_three-manifolds","239761846_The_Continuous_Newton's_Method_Inverse_Functions_and_Nash-Moser","239666346_The_combinatorial_theory_of_complexes","238754627_Bestimmung_der_Primfaktorzerlegung_von_Verkettungen","238127324_Hyperbolic_groups_in_Essays_in_group_theory","232743664_The_homeomorphism_problem_for_closed_3-manifolds","228557832_Thin_Position_and_the_Recognition_Problem_for_boldS3","225883684_Ein_Verfahren_zur_Aufspaltung_einer_3-Mannigfaltigkeit_in_irreduzible_3-Mannigfaltigkeiten","225172549_Topologie_Dreidimensionaler_Gefaserter_Raume","222095559_Undecidable_problems_A_sampler","2143190_Simplicial_moves_on_complexes_and_manifolds","2132203_Suspensions_of_homology_spheres","2103548_An_algorithm_to_find_vertical_tori_in_small_Seifert_fiber_spaces","2098197_Algorithmic_detection_and_description_of_hyperbolic_structures_on_closed_3-manifolds_with_solvable_word_problem"]}
