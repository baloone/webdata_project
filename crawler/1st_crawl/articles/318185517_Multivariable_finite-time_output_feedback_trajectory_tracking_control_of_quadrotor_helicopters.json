{"id":"318185517_Multivariable_finite-time_output_feedback_trajectory_tracking_control_of_quadrotor_helicopters","abstract":"A continuous multivariable output feedback control scheme is developed for trajectory tracking and attitude stabilization of quadrotor helicopters. The whole closed-loop system is composed by position loop and attitude loop. The homogeneous technique is used to design finite-time stabilizing controller and observer in each loop. The virtual control is introduced in position loop to ensure that the real control is smooth enough such that it can be tracked by attitude loop. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through homogeneity and Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulations.","authors":["Bailing Tian","Hanchen Lu","Zongyu Zuo","Qun Zong"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control 28(9)","DOI:10.1002/rnc.3869"],"references":["285329104_High-order_sliding_modes_Differentiation_and_output_feedback_control","282178725_A_novel_sliding_mode_controller_for_small-scale_unmanned_helicopters_with_mismatched_disturbance","261483512_On_ISS_and_iISS_properties_of_homogeneous_systems","258476774_Robust_Fuzzy_Backstepping_Sliding_Mode_Controller_For_a_Quadrotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle","253785103_Higher-order_sliding_modes_differentiation_and_output-feedback_control","225467146_Feedback_linearization_vs_adaptive_sliding_mode_control_for_a_quadrotor_helicopter_International_Journal_of_Control_Automation_and_Systems_73_419-428","224393490_Dynamic_inversion_with_zero-dynamics_stabilisation_for_quadrotor_control","224198367_Trajectory_tracking_control_design_with_command-filtered_compensation_for_quadrotor","222864053_Smooth_second-order_sliding_modes_Missile_guidance_application","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","221076856_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","220061130_H-Infinity_Static_Output-Feedback_Control_for_Rotorcraft","315662374_A_fixed-time_output_feedback_control_scheme_for_double_integrator_systems","313520128_H-infinity_static_output_feedback_control_for_rotorcraft","312942865_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","304711576_Leader-Follower_Fixed-Time_Consensus_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_High-Order_Integrator_Dynamics","290991709_Robust_Three-Loop_Trajectory_Tracking_Control_for_Quadrotors_With_Multiple_Uncertainties","279804857_Flight_Control_Design_for_Small-Scale_Helicopter_Using_Disturbance-Observer-Based_Backstepping","279215665_Finite_Time_Reentry_Attitude_Control_Based_on_Adaptive_Multivariable_Disturbance_Compensation","269726765_Nonlinear_robust_sliding_mode_control_of_a_quadrotor_unmanned_aerial_vehicle_based_on_immersion_and_invariance_method","267434297_Backstepping_sliding_mode_controller_improved_with_fuzzy_logic_Application_to_the_quadrotor_helicopter","267072322_Finite-time_output_feedback_stabilization_and_control_for_a_quadrotor_mini-aircraft","264235292_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","260541806_Robust_LQR_Attitude_Control_of_a_3-DOF_Laboratory_Helicopter_for_Aggressive_Maneuvers","260519681_Dynamics_of_Discrete-Time_Sliding-Mode-Control_Uncertain_Systems_With_a_Disturbance_Compensator","260026492_A_multivariable_super-twisting_sliding_mode_approach","257581531_Linear_Quadratic_Control_for_Quadrotors_UAVs_Dynamics_and_Formation_Flight","255786198_Multirotor_Aerial_Vehicles_Modeling_Estimation_and_Control_of_Quadrotor","252026315_Robustness_analysis_of_unmanned_helicopter_flight_control_law_using_m-analysis_techniques","251629612_Precision_flight_control_for_a_multi-vehicle_quadrotor_helicopter_testbed","229882753_Global_stabilization_of_a_class_of_upper-triangular_systems_with_unbounded_or_uncontrollable_linearizations","222649179_Modeling_and_control_of_a_large_quadrotor_robot","222033754_Sliding_mode_control_of_a_class_of_underactuated_systems","220387320_Finite-Time_Attitude_Tracking_Control_of_Spacecraft_With_Application_to_Attitude_Synchronization","30846679_Geometric_homogeneity_with_application_to_finite-time_stability"]}
