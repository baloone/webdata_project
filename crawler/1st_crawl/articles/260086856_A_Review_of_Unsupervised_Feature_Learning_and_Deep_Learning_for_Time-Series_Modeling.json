{"id":"260086856_A_Review_of_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_and_Deep_Learning_for_Time-Series_Modeling","abstract":"This paper gives a review of the recent developments in deep learning and un-supervised feature learning for time-series problems. While these techniques have shown promise for modeling static data, such as computer vision, ap-plying them to time-series data is gaining increasing attention. This paper overviews the particular challenges present in time-series data and provides a review of the works that have either applied time-series data to unsupervised feature learning algorithms or alternatively have contributed to modications of feature learning algorithms to take into account the challenges present in time-series data.","authors":["Martin Johan LÃ¤ngkvist","Lars Karlsson","Amy Loutfi"],"meta":["June 2014Pattern Recognition Letters 42(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2014.01.008"],"references":["335788237_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","309186321_A_practical_guide_to_training_restricted_boltzmann_machinesJ","304109482_Training_products_of_experts_by_minimizing_contrastive_divergence","287653271_State-of-The-Art_in_stock_prediction_techniques","285785263_Handbook_of_machine_olfaction_Electronic_nose_technology","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","272746011_A_Practical_Guide_to_Training_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Version_1","268239246_On_the_need_for_time_series_data_mining_benchmarks","267801007_Learning_sparse_feature_representations_for_music_annotation_and_retrieval","267223057_Deep_Learning_of_Invariant_Spatio-Temporal_Features_from_Video_A","265446217_Introduction_to_dynamic_systems_Theory_models_and_applications","265135217_Modeling_Physiological_Data_with_Deep_Belief_Networks","265002936_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
