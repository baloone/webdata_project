{"id":"321274028_Co-designing_with_children_a_collaborative_augmented_reality_book_based_on_a_primary_school_textbook","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR)ยน has been proven to support collaboration when used in different contexts. AR Books have been developed for children in different contexts including entertainment and education. However, the involvement of children in designing AR Books based on the actual school textbooks has not been covered previously. This paper presents co-design process of involving primary school children in the design and evaluation of an AR textbook for collaborative learning experience. Using cooperative inquiry techniques as an appropriate method of co-design with children, this paper proposes the key design features that can be integrated in the school textbook for a collaborative AR textbook.","authors":["Haifa Alhumaidan","Kathy Pui Ying Lo","Andrew Selby"],"meta":["November 2017International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction 15","DOI:10.1016/j.ijcci.2017.11.005","Project: Co-designing with children a collaborative augmented reality book based on a primary school textbook"],"references":["284091450_Collaboration_in_Augmented_Reality","281373061_Mobile_Learning_Moving_Past_the_Myths_and_Embracing_the_Opportunities","263317872_Aligning_technological_and_pedagogical_considerations_Harnessing_touch-technology_to_enhance_opportunities_for_collaborative_gameplay_and_reciprocal_teaching_in_NZ_early_education","262851486_Probes_toolkits_and_prototypes_Three_approaches_to_making_in_codesigning","236631644_FACIT_PD_A_Framework_for_Analysis_and_Creation_of_Intergenerational_Techniques_for_Participatory_Design","233062527_Connecting_generations_Developing_co-design_methods_for_older_adults_and_children","221517509_Cooperative_Inquiry_Developing_new_Technologies_for_Children_with_Children","221513906_Layered_elaboration_A_new_technique_for_co-design_with_children","216867620_Lessons_from_an_AR_Book_study","262221821_A_psychological_perspective_on_augmented_reality_in_the_mathematics_classroom","222399055_Designing_collaborative_constructionist_and_contextual_applications_for_handheld_devices","216813980_Collaborative_use_of_mobile_augmented_reality_with_paper_maps"]}
