{"id":"318009370_Integrating_Kolb's_Experiential_Learning_Theory_into_a_sport_psychology_classroom_using_a_golf-putting_activity","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to describe the integration of Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) within an undergraduate sport psychology course. According to Kolb, experiential learning occurs through a continual process within the four-stage learning cycle: Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation. In the course, we used golf-putting tournaments to promote experiential learning during a 15-week semester. Between tournaments, we delivered lectures and facilitated laboratory sessions to discuss and practice sport psychology theories (e.g., Achievement Goal Theory) and skills (e.g., goal-setting, imagery). This article provides a detailed discussion of the structure of golf-putting tournaments, course design, and the use of reflective practice within a sport psychology classroom.","authors":["Takahiro Sato","David D Laughlin"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Sport Psychology in Action 9(1)","DOI:10.1080/21520704.2017.1325807"],"references":["281106038_Enhancing_student_learning_experiences_in_sport_psychology_modules_using_practical_activities","276307641_So_What_Do_We_Do_With_the_Rest_of_the_Day_Going_Beyond_the_Pre-Shot_Routine_in_Professional_Golf","263462474_Self-Talk_in_the_Swimming_Pool_The_Effects_of_Self-Talk_on_Thought_Content_and_Performance_on_Water-Polo_Tasks","256766236_Problem-based_and_experiential_learning_Engaging_students_in_an_undergraduate_physical_education_module","254249711_Exploring_an_experiential_learning_project_through_Kolb's_Learning_Theory_using_a_qualitative_research_method","247515261_The_Effect_of_Multiple-Goal_Strategies_on_Performance_Outcomes_in_Training_and_Competition","241279598_The_Effects_of_a_Motivational_General-Mastery_Imagery_Intervention_on_the_Imagery_Ability_and_Sport_Confidence_of_Inter-Collegiate_Golfers","235984021_A_Qualitative_Exploration_of_Choking_in_Elite_Golf","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","234166645_Reflections_on_the_Application_of_Reflective_Practice_for_Supervision_in_Applied_Sport_Psychology","232940685_Developing_Curricula_to_Encourage_Students_to_Write_Reflective_Journals","222902279_The_effects_of_a_motivational_general-arousal_imagery_intervention_upon_preperformance_symptoms_in_male_rugby_union_players","222428460_Mechanisms_underlying_the_self-talk-performance_relationship_The_effects_of_motivational_self-talk_on_self-confidence_and_anxiety","201381976_Learning_Styles_and_Learning_Spaces_Enhancing_Experiential_Learning_in_Higher_Education","313668911_Cognitive_techniques_for_building_confidence_and_enhancing_performance","285738864_Controlling_Emotions_in_Sport","285456944_The_Effects_of_Group_Size_in_Sport","283930840_Learning_styles_and_learning_spaces_Enhancing_experiencial_learning_in_higher_education","280016575_The_Effect_of_Imagery_Function_and_Imagery_Direction_on_Self-Efficacy_and_Performance_on_a_Golf-Putting_Task","276227629_An_Exploration_of_Reflection_Expression_of_Learning_Style_in_an_International_Experiential_Learning_Context","267791314_Perceptions_of_the_teaching_environment_engagement_and_burnout_among_university_students_on_a_sports-related_degree_programme_in_the_UK","264486500_Group_Dynamics_in_Physical_Activity_Promotion_What_works","257600747_Evaluating_sport_psychology_teaching_through_action_research","253688145_Broken_Clubs_and_Expletives_The_Sources_of_Stress_and_Coping_Responses_of_Skilled_and_Moderately_Skilled_Golfers","238440463_An_Introduction_to_Using_Mental_Skills_to_Enhance_Performance_in_Golf_Beyond_the_Bounds_of_Positive_and_Negative_Thinking","236172510_A_Phenomenological_Analysis_of_Coping_Effectiveness_in_Golf","233830288_The_Effects_of_Training_and_Competition_on_Achievement_Goals_Motivational_Responses_and_Performance_in_a_Golf-Putting_Task","233467543_Stress_and_Coping_Among_International_Adolescent_Golfers","232585239_Psychological_Interventions_with_Athletes_in_Competitive_Situations_A_Review","232551856_Imagery_Use_in_Sport_A_Literature_Review_and_Applied_Model","232536079_Applied_Sport_Psychology_Personal_Growth_to_Peak_Performance_2nd_ed","44526864_In_pursuit_of_excellence_how_to_win_in_sport_and_life_through_mental_training_Terry_Orlick","43768887_An_Application_of_a_Modified_Experiential_Learning_Model_for_a_Higher_Education_Course_Evidence_of_Increased_Outcomes"]}
