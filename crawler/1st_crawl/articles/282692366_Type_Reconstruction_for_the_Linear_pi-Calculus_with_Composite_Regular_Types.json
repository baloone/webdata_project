{"id":"282692366_Type_Reconstruction_for_the_Linear_pi-Calculus_with_Composite_Regular_Types","abstract":"We extend the linear {\\pi}-calculus with composite regular types in such a\nway that data containing linear values can be shared among several processes,\nif there is no overlapping access to such values. We describe a type\nreconstruction algorithm for the extended type system and discuss some\npractical aspects of its implementation.","authors":["Luca Padovani"],"meta":["October 2015Logical Methods in Computer Science 11(4)","DOI:10.2168/LMCS-11(4:13)2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278829134_Type_Reconstruction_Algorithms_for_Deadlock-Free_and_Lock-Free_Linear_p-Calculi","265089482_Recursive_Session_Types_Revisited","248499802_Advanced_Topics_in_Types_and_Programming_Languages","221602730_Language_Primitives_and_Type_Discipline_for_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming","2417319_Language_Primitives_And_Type_Discipline_For_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming","266952232_Type_Reconstruction_for_the_Linear_p-Calculus_with_Composite_and_Equi-Recursive_Types","266659036_Deadlock_and_lock_freedom_in_the_linear_p-calculus","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","262162925_Session_types_revisited","223356067_Fundamental_Properties_of_Infinite_Trees","222699575_A_Type_System_for_Lock-Free_Processes","222566433_Type_Reconstruction_for_Linear_p-Calculus_with_IO_Subtyping","220994018_How_to_Infer_Finite_Session_Types_in_a_Calculus_of_Services_and_Sessions","220700533_Types_for_Dynamic_Interaction","220700507_Full_Abstraction_in_a_Subtyped_pi-Calculus_with_Linear_Types","220700476_A_New_Type_System_for_Deadlock-Free_Processes","220694801_Types_and_Programming_Languages","220690132_The_Pi-Calculus_-_a_theory_of_mobile_processes","220197414_Subtyping_for_session_types_in_the_pi_calculus","2937521_Once_Upon_a_Type","2921934_Quasi-Linear_Types","2913324_Type_Systems_for_Concurrent_Programs","2804299_Type-based_Analysis_of_Communication_for_Concurrent_Programming_Languages","2513082_Linearity_and_the_Pi-Calculus","2447997_Type-Based_Analysis_Of_Usage_Of_Values_For_Concurrent_Programming_Languages","2292439_Typing_Confluence"]}
