{"id":"320336136_Improving_Coarsening_Schemes_for_Hypergraph_Partitioning_by_Exploiting_Community_Structure","abstract":"We present an improved coarsening process for multilevel hypergraph partitioning that incorporates global information about the community structure. Community detection is performed via modularity maximization on a bipartite graph representation. The approach is made suitable for different classes of hypergraphs by defining weights for the graph edges that express structural properties of the hypergraph. We integrate our approach into a leading multilevel hypergraph partitioner with strong local search algorithms and perform extensive experiments on a large benchmark set of hypergraphs stemming from application areas such as VLSI design, SAT solving, and scientific computing. Our results indicate that respecting community structure during coarsening not only significantly improves the solutions found by the initial partitioning algorithm, but also consistently improves overall solution quality.","authors":["Sebastian Schlag"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.SEA.2017.21","Conference: 16th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2017)At: London","Project: KaHyPar - Karlsruhe Hypergraph Partitioning"],"references":["323141987_Network_Flow-Based_Refinement_for_Multilevel_Hypergraph_Partitioning","309858392_Engineering_a_direct_k-way_Hypergraph_Partitioning_Algorithm","283762237_k-way_Hypergraph_Partitioning_via_n-Level_Recursive_Bisection","267433461_Graph_partitioning_and_graph_clustering_Proceedings_of_the_10th_DIMACS_implementation_challenge_workshop_Atlanta_GA_USA_February_13-14_2012","260194047_Partitioning_Complex_Networks_via_Size-Constrained_Clustering","324337656_Flows_in_Networks","315749851_Combinatorial_Algorithms_for_Integrated_Circuit_Layout","265425391_Maximal_Flow_Through_a_Network","246908681_Multiterminal_Flows_in_a_Hypergraph","237966646_Circuit_Partitioning_A_Network-Flow-Based_Balanced_Min-Cut_Approach"]}
