There has been some disagreement over whether Scofield's results should be subject to renormalization from a Hartree-Slater to a Hartree-Fock atomic model. Therefore in the tables a comparison is made of Scofield's predictions both with and without this renormalization. 10 refs.","authors":["E.B. Saloman","J.H.
