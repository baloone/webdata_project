{"id":"331197722_Antihyperuricemia_Antioxidant_and_Antibacterial_Activities_of_Tridax_procumbens_L","abstract":"Tridax procumbens L. is a medicinal plant and used as a drink to treat bronchial catarrh,\ndiarrhea, dysentery and liver diseases. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of T. procumbens\nto treat hyperuricemia, oxidative stress, and bacterial infection. Ethyl acetate extract of this\nplant was separated to different fractions by column chromatography (CC) using chloroform and\nmethanol as eluents and subjected to xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory, antioxidant, and antibacterial\nassays. The results showed that the F45–47 fraction exhibited the strongest XO inhibitory activity\n(IC50 = 133.17 �g/mL), while the F48–50 fraction possessed maximum antioxidant activity assessed\nby DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2’-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic\nacid) assays (IC50 = 0.51 and 1.04 mg/mL, respectively). In addition, the F4–5 fraction\npresented the most effective inhibition on the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,\nBacillus subtilis, and Proteus mirabilis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GS-MS)\nand liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrophotometry (LC-ESI-MS) results\nrevealed that fatty acids, glycerides, and flavonoids were the major compounds of the F45–47\nfraction. Glycerides, triose sugar alcohols, and fatty acids were dominant compounds of the F48–50\nfraction, while sterols were principal components of the F4–5 fraction. This study indicated that\nT. procumbens had potent inhibitory effects on XO inhibitory, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities.\nThese biological activities may be attributed to the presence of fatty acids, flavonoids, and sterols in\nthis plant. It is suggested that T. procumbens can be utilized as a healthy source to develop beverages\nand foods to treat antihyperuricemia, oxidative stress, and bacterial infection","authors":["Yusuf Andriana","Tran Dang Xuan","Quy Tran Ngoc","Ngoc Truong"],"meta":["January 2019"],"references":["326711470_Isolation_and_Purification_of_Potent_Growth_Inhibitors_from_Piper_methysticum_Root","325231831_Comparison_Between_Disk_Diffusion_and_Agar_Dilution_Methods_to_Determine_In_Vitro_Susceptibility_of_Corynebacterium_spp_Clinical_Isolates_and_Update_of_their_Susceptibility","323704657_Allelopathic_potential_of_Tridax_procumbens_L_on_radish_and_identification_of_allelochemicals","322839948_Viewpoint_A_Contributory_Role_of_Shell_Ginger_Alpinia_zerumbet_Pers_BL_Burtt_RM_Sm_for_Human_Longevity_in_Okinawa_Japan","322709592_Cordycepin_a_Characteristic_Bioactive_Constituent_in_Cordyceps_militaris_Ameliorates_Hyperuricemia_through_URAT1_in_Hyperuricemic_Mice","319196172_Antioxidant_and_Xanthine_Oxidase_Inhibitory_Activities_of_Total_Polyphenols_from_Onion","310597336_Xanthine_oxidase_inhibitory_and_antioxidant_potential_of_Indian_Muscodor_species","307557803_Anti-oxidant_anti-diabetic_antimicrobial_and_hemolytic_activity_of_Tridax_procumbens","295826837_Antioxidant_Activity_of_Ethanol_Extracts_from_Tridax_procumbens","288717535_Assessment_of_antibacterial_and_antifungal_activities_of_silver_nanoparticles_obtained_from_the_callus_extracts_stem_and_leaf_of_Tridax_procumbens_L"]}
