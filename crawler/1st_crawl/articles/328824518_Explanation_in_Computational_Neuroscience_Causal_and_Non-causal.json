{"id":"328824518_Explanation_in_Computational_Neuroscience_Causal_and_Non-causal","abstract":"This article examines three candidate cases of non-causal explanation in computational neuroscience. I argue that there are instances of efficient coding explanation that are strongly analogous to examples of non-causal explanation in physics and biology, as presented by Batterman ([2002]), Woodward ([2003]), and Lange ([2013]). By integrating Lange’s and Woodward’s accounts, I offer a new way to elucidate the distinction between causal and non-causal explanation, and to address concerns about the explanatory sufficiency of non-mechanistic models in neuroscience. I also use this framework to shed light on the dispute over the interpretation of dynamical models of the brain.\n\n• 1 Introduction\n\n• 1.1 Efficient coding explanation in computational neuroscience\n• 1.2 Defining non-causal explanation\n• 2 Case I: Hybrid Computation\n• 3 Case II: The Gabor Model Revisited\n• 4 Case III: A Dynamical Model of Prefrontal Cortex\n\n• 4.1 A new explanation of context-dependent computation\n• 4.2 Causal or non-causal?\n• 5 Causal and Non-causal: Does the Difference Matter?","authors":["Mazviita Chirimuuta"],"meta":["September 2018The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 69(3):849-880","DOI:10.1093/bjps/axw034"],"references":["290495125_Functional_Analyses_Mechanistic_Explanations_and_Explanatory_Tradeoffs","265258561_The_Ratio_Club_A_Hub_of_British_Cybernetics","258348029_Context-dependent_computation_by_recurrent_dynamics_in_prefrontal_cortex","243712413_Possible_Principles_Underlying_the_Transformations_of_Sensory_Messages","240548010_Thinking_About_Mechanisms","234009604_Opening_the_Black_Box_Low-Dimensional_Dynamics_in_High-Dimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","232926964_Neural_Computation_and_the_Computational_Theory_of_Cognition","228498758_The_Explanatory_Force_of_Dynamical_and_Mathematical_Models_in_Neuroscience_A_Mechanistic_Perspective","220607646_Topological_Explanations_and_Robustness_in_Biological_Sciences","220607606_Integrating_psychology_and_neuroscience_Functional_analyses_as_mechanism_sketches","220607503_Explanation_and_Description_in_Computational_Neuroscience","220607463_Models_and_mechanisms_in_psychological_explanation","326941247_The_development_and_application_of_efficient_coding_explanation_in_neuroscience","326802734_Explanation_in_neurobiology_An_interventionist_perspective","316098737_How_Mathematics_Can_Make_a_Difference","311647120_The_Explanatory_Power_of_Network_Models","311260930_The_explanatory_power_of_network_models","306297110_Complements_Not_Competitors_Causal_and_Mathematical_Explanations","303576399_Reassessing_Woodward's_account_of_explanation_regularities_counterfactuals_and_non-causal_explanations","303140520_Two_kinds_of_idealization","289546268_Principles_of_Neural_Design","286004317_Explaining_the_Brain","284081056_Uncertainty_relation_for_resolution_in_space_spatial_frequency_and_orientation_optimized_by_two-dimensional_visual_cortical_filters","282216636_A_Functional_Account_of_Causation","281596597_Dynamical_Models_and_Explanation_in_Neuroscience","276512052_The_scope_and_limits_of_a_mechanistic_view_of_computational_explanation","274412756_What_Makes_a_Scientific_Explanation_Distinctively_Mathematical","272551190_Minimal_Model_Explanations","272538923_Models_robustness_and_non-causal_explanation_a_foray_into_cognitive_science_and_biology","271899608_Constraints_on_Localization_and_Decomposition_as_Explanatory_Strategies_in_the_Biological_Sciences","271732667_Reassessing_Woodward's_Account_of_Explanation_Regularities_Counterfactuals_and_Noncausal_Explanations","265478711_What_was_Hodgkin_and_Huxley's_Achievement","265258525_The_Mechanical_Mind_in_History","265104661_Roadrunner_Hardware_and_Software_Overview","263210129_Minimal_models_and_canonical_neural_computations_The_distinctness_of_computational_explanation_in_neuroscience","261944206_The_Enhanced_Indispensability_Argument_Representational_Versus_Explanatory_Role_of_Mathematics_in_Science","260920233_Chaos_in_Dynamical_Systems","259709406_Mechanism_and_Biological_Explanation","259554638_Moving_Beyond_Causes_Optimality_Models_and_Scientific_Explanation","259550796_II-Mechanistic_Explanation_Its_Scope_and_Limits","257666677_Remarks_on_Counterpossibles","257637685_On_Counterpossibles","257539383_Optimality_Explanations_A_Plea_for_an_Alternative_Approach","257381912_Three_Kinds_of_Idealization","233971730_Ultra_Low_Power_Bioelectronics_Fundamentals_Biomedical_Applications_and_Bio-Inspired_Systems","227770538_Philosophy_for_the_Rest_of_Cognitive_Science","227693300_Dynamical_Models_An_Alternative_or_Complement_to_Mechanistic_Explanations","225477104_The_limiting_information_capacity_of_a_neuronal_link","225144510_A_Logical_Calculus_of_the_Idea_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","224982284_A_logical_Calculus_of_Ideas_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","210296603_Design_Explanation_Determining_the_Constraints_on_What_Can_Be_Alive","51273162_Development_of_the_Brain_Depends_on_the_Visual_Environment","36444729_After_the_Philosophy_of_Mind_Replacing_Scholasticism_with_Science","220607302_How_Scientific_Models_Can_Explain","36445163_On_the_Explanatory_Role_of_Mathematics_in_Empirical_Science"]}
