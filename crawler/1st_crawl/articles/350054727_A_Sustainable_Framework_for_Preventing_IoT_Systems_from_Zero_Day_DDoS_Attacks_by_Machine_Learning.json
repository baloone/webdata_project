{"id":"350054727_A_Sustainable_Framework_for_Preventing_IoT_Systems_from_Zero_Day_DDoS_Attacks_by_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging trend in computer science which brings the idea of\neverything connected. It leads to future smart systems in every field from education, health, industry to\nagriculture sector. IoT systems are generating data in exponential size from heterogeneous devices and now\nIoT security become main issue of research to address. IoT security is very crucial in nature and number of\nsecurity techniques have been proposed to secure the IoT systems. Still, there is need of new and state of\nthe art techniques to address the newly and day by day arising attacks known as Zero Day attacks. In this\nresearch paper, we have proposed a machine learning empowered sustainable framework to address the\nZero Day DDoS attacks which is based on Honeypot. The framework in novel as it uses the specific honeypot\ngenerated dataset for underlying system. The system is efficiently trained on specific nature honeypot\ndataset to address the Zero Day DDoS attacks and sustainability feature will enable this framework to cope\nwith future security requirements.","authors":["Mubashir Ali","Ayesha Siddique","Aamir Hussain","Farhad Hassan"],"meta":["March 2021"],"references":["347752321_Addressing_Sinkhole_Attacks_In_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_-A_Review","346816068_The_Use_of_Honeypot_in_Machine_Learning_Based_on_Malware_Detection_A_Review","332910149_A_Survey_On_Honeypots_Honeynets_And_Their_Applications_On_Smart_Grid","329985182_Security_Challenges_and_Solutions_in_theInternet_of_Things","342962104_AI-powered_Honeypots_for_Enhanced_IoT_Botnet_Detection","338947486_Current_State_of_Honeypots_and_Deception_Strategies_in_Cybersecurity","330875499_IoT_Honeypot_A_Review_from_Researcher's_Perspective","329496517_Survey_of_Snaring_Cyber_Attacks_on_IoT_Devices_with_Honeypots_and_Honeynets","326862564_Machine_Learning_DDoS_Detection_for_Consumer_Internet_of_Things_Devices","326539025_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Review_of_Enabling_Technologies_Challenges_and_Open_Research_Issues","318288727_DDoS_in_the_IoT_Mirai_and_other_botnets","323118778_The_Effect_of_IoT_New_Features_on_Security_and_Privacy_New_Threats_Existing_Solutions_and_Challenges_Yet_to_Be_Solved","317423702_Use_of_honeypots_for_mitigating_DoS_attacks_targeted_on_IoT_networks","313464793_Botnets_and_Internet_of_Things_Security","310828268_Identifying_the_Scan_and_Attack_Infrastructures_Behind_Amplification_DDoS_Attacks"]}
