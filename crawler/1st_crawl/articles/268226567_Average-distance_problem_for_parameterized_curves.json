{"id":"268226567_Average-distance_problem_for_parameterized_curves","abstract":"We consider approximating a measure by a parameterized curve subject to\nlength penalization. That is for a given finite positive compactly supported\nmeasure $\\mu$, for $p \\geq 1$ and $\\lambda>0$ we consider the functional \\[\nE(\\gamma) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} d(x, \\Gamma_\\gamma)^p d\\mu(x) + \\lambda\n\\,\\textrm{Length}(\\gamma) \\] where $\\gamma:I \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$, $I$ is an\ninterval in $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\Gamma_\\gamma = \\gamma(I)$, and $d(x,\n\\Gamma_\\gamma)$ is the distance of $x$ to $\\Gamma_\\gamma$.\nThe problem is closely related to the average-distance problem, where the\nadmissible class are the connected sets of finite Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal\nH^1$, and to (regularized) principal curves studied in statistics. We obtain\nregularity of minimizers in the form of estimates on the total curvature of the\nminimizers. We prove that for measures $\\mu$ supported in two dimensions the\nminimizing curve is injective if $p \\geq 2$ or if $\\mu$ has bounded density.\nThis establishes that the minimization over parameterized curves is equivalent\nto minimizing over embedded curves and thus confirms that the problem has a\ngeometric interpretation.","authors":["Xin Yang Lu","Dejan Slepƒçev"],"meta":["November 2014ESAIM Control Optimisation and Calculus of Variations 22(2)","DOI:10.1051/cocv/2015011","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268889765_Minimization_problems_for_average_distance_functionals","228659039_Stationary_configurations_for_the_average_distance_functional_and_related_problems","228527140_Optimal_Transportation_Networks_as_Free_Dirichlet_Regions_for_the_Monge-Kantorovich_Problem","228498550_A_presentation_of_the_average_distance_minimizing_problem","225568537_Regularized_Principal_Manifolds","225393479_Hamilton-Jacobi_Equations_and_Distance_Functions_on_Riemannian_Manifolds","220319957_Regularized_Principal_Manifolds","220132124_A_Model_for_the_Optimal_Planning_of_an_Urban_Area","29605692_Optimal_Transportation_Problems_with_Free_Dirichlet_Regions","29598301_A_Mass_Transportation_Model_for_the_Optimal_Planning_of_an_Urban_Region","3193089_Learning_and_design_of_principal_curves","266587166_A_First_Course_in_Sobolev_Spaces","265705447_Properties_of_Minimizers_of_Average-Distance_Problem_via_Discrete_Approximation_of_Measures","265449587_Steiner_Minimal_Trees","260214141_Counterexample_to_regularity_in_average-distance_problem","254286844_Principal_Curves","250796441_Qualitative_Properties_of_Maximum_Distance_Minimizers_and_Average_Distance_Minimizers_in_R_n","248390442_Function_Analysis_Sobolev_Spaces_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","242351344_The_Steiner_Tree_Problem","237560159_About_the_regularity_of_average_distance_minimizers_in_R2","235047161_Principal_Curves_and_Surfaces","229480569_Optimal_Urban_Networks_via_Mass_Transportation","225664762_Blow-up_of_optimal_sets_in_the_irrigation_problem","220133169_Optimal_Pricing_Policies_for_Public_Transportation_Networks","2670190_Principal_Curves_Revisited","2466760_Lecture_Notes_in_Statistics"]}
