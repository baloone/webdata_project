{"id":"260366580_Backbone_discovery_in_traffic_networks","abstract":"We introduce a new computational problem, the BackboneDiscovery problem,\nwhich encapsulates both functional and structural aspects of network analysis.\nFor example, while the topology of a typical road network has been available\nfor a long time (e.g., through paper maps), it is only recently that\nfine-granularity usage information about the network (like gps traces), is\nbeing collected and is readily accessible. By combining functional and\nstructural information, the solution of BackboneDiscovery provides an efficient\nway to explore and understand usage patterns of networks and aid in design and\ndecision making. To address the BackboneDiscovery problem, we propose two\nalgorithms that make use of the concepts of edge centrality. Our results\nindicate that it is possible to construct very sparse backbones that summarize\nthe network activity very accurately. We also demonstrate that the usage of\nedge-centrality measures helps produce backbones of higher quality.","authors":["Sanjay Chawla","Kiran Garimella","Aristides Gionis","Dominic Tsang"],"meta":["November 2016International Journal of Data Science and Analytics 1(3-4)","DOI:10.1007/s41060-016-0017-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260514929_Improving_Network_Management_with_Software_Defined_Networking","227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","225620304_Approximating_k-Spanner_Problems_for_k_2","313565837_Random_Walks_and_Electric_Networks","301257978_Discovering_the_Network_Backbone_from_Traffic_Activity_Data","300947030_Centrality_Estimation_in_Large_Networks","268019959_The_Design_of_Approximation_Algorithms","265835106_Activity_preserving_graph_simplification","255722482_Axioms_for_Centrality","245534689_Correspondence_Some_theoretical_aspects_of_road_traffic_research","222660919_Harmony_in_the_Small-World","222958534_Two_flow_network_simplification_algorithms","222671188_A_Measure_of_Betweenness_Centrality_based_on_Random_Walks","222517213_Approximating_k-spanner_problems_for","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks"]}
