{"id":"338068501_Interactive_Visualisation_of_Hierarchical_Quantitative_Data_An_Evaluation","abstract":"We have compared three common visualisations for hierarchical quantitative data, treemaps, icicle plots and sunburst charts as well as a semicircular variant of sunburst charts we call the sundown chart. In a pilot study, we found that the sunburst chart was least preferred. In a controlled study with 12 participants, we compared treemaps, icicle plots and sundown charts. Treemap was the least preferred and had a slower performance on a basic navigation task and slower performance and accuracy in hierarchy understanding tasks. The icicle plot and sundown chart had similar performance with slight user preference for the icicle plot.","authors":["Linda Woodburn","Yalong Yang","Kim Marriott"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933545","Conference: 2019 IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS)"],"references":["280575058_Cabinet_Tree_an_orthogonal_enclosure_approach_to_visualizing_and_exploring_big_data","263352347_Fitting_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Models_Using_lme4","262149604_Treevisnet_A_Tree_Visualization_Reference","319361962_Stable_Treemaps_via_Local_Moves","314825044_Visualizing_the_stock_market","313579212_Hierarchical_aggregation_for_information_visualization_Overview_techniques_and_design_guidelines","303508002_The_Flame_Graph","301481852_Design_of_Visualizations_for_Human-Information_Interaction_A_Pattern-Based_Framework","289963533_Graphical_perception_Theory_experimentation_and_application_to_the_development_of_graphical_methods","275385252_Tree_Colors_Color_Schemes_for_Tree-Structured_Data"]}
