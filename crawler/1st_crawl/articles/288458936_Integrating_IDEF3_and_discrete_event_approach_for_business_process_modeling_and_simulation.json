{"id":"288458936_Integrating_IDEF3_and_discrete_event_approach_for_business_process_modeling_and_simulation","abstract":"Simulation is a dynamic modeling technology. However there is little integration of business process static modeling and simulation, which prevented simulation from becoming a mainstream modeling tool. The static IDEF3 modeling method and discrete event simulation are firstly introduced. Then, the principles and methods of integrating IDEF3 and discrete event approach for business process modeling and simulation are proposed and a supporting software tool of integrating business process mapping and simulation based on IDEF3 is developed which facilitates simulation modeling. Finally, a case study of an actual business process is conducted by using the developed supporting software tool to illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of the approaches proposed.","authors":["Y.
