{"id":"357672979_48UK_Effect_of_Flipped_Learning_on_Students_Achievement_in_Computer_Science_in_Tertiary_Institution_in_Enugu_State","abstract":"The researcher investigated the effect of flipped method on students' achievement in computer science tertiary institutions in Enugu state of Nigeria using quasi-experimental design. The instrument for data collection was pretest-posttest non equivalent control group. The population for the study comprised all higher institutions in Enugu state. Data were collected from a sample of 152 students selected from two secondary higher institutions. A reliability coefficient of 0.89 was obtained from the instrument through test retest. Mean and standard deviation scores were used to answer the research questions, while two-way analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significant. The findings show that students exposed to learning using flipped method achieved higher than those taught with traditional method. It was recommended that ministry of education should revisit the instructional materials used in teaching.","authors":["Chinasa Odo"],"meta":["January 2022"],"references":[]}
