{"id":"313481424_Deterministic_Protocols_in_the_SINR_Model_without_Knowledge_of_Coordinates","abstract":"Much work has been developed for studying the classical broadcasting problem in the SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio) model for wireless device transmission. The setting typically studied is when all radio nodes transmit a signal of the same strength. This work studies the challenging problem of devising a distributed algorithm for multi-broadcasting, assuming a subset of nodes are initially awake, for the SINR model when each device only has access to knowledge about the total number of nodes in the network $n$, the range from which each node's label is taken $[1,\\dots,N]$, and the label of the device itself. Specifically, we assume no knowledge of the physical coordinates of devices and also no knowledge of neighborhood of each node. We present a deterministic protocol for the multi-broadcast problem in $O(n \\lg^2 N \\lg n)$ rounds, for this setting, assuming that only a subset of all $n$ nodes are initially awake. A lower bound of $\\Omega(n \\lg N)$ rounds is known for this, but even that assumes knowledge of physical coordinates. All previous results in the literature are either randomized or intensively use the physical coordinates of the nodes and/or knowledge of the labels of nodes' neighbors. In addition to the above result, we present algorithms to achieve multi-broadcast in $O(n \\lg^2 N)$ rounds and create a backbone in $O(n \\lg^2 N)$ rounds, assuming that all nodes are initially awake. For a given backbone, messages can be exchanged between every pair of connected nodes in the backbone in $O(\\lg N)$ rounds and between any node and its leader in the backbone in $O(\\Delta \\lg N)$ rounds.","authors":["Jr. William K.
