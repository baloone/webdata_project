{"id":"237598134_Improving_teaching_in_Computer_Programming_by_adopting_student-centred_learning_strategies","abstract":"Currently, the teacher-centred teaching and learning strategies still dominate the classrooms of most of universities in China. In this paper, new strategies to improve teaching and learning quality, are introduced. First, current conditions and characteristics of Computer Programming in Ocean University of China (OUC) are introduced; then the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional teacher- centred learning strategies are discussed. After that reasonable modifications from a strongly teacher-centred approach of teaching and learning to a more student- centred approach of teaching and learning are suggested, based on the author's teaching experience. Some modern student-centred strategies and techniques including concept mapping, peer learning methods and e-learning are introduced and their applications in the course of Computer Programming are discussed.","authors":["Hu Xiaohui"],"meta":[],"references":["256600232_Multiple_Intelligences_The_Theory_in_Practice-A_Reader","234590312_Peer_Tutoring_A_Guide_to_Learning_by_Teaching","232044480_AMEE_Guide_No_20_The_good_teacher_is_more_than_a_lecturer_-_the_twelve_roles_of_the_teacher"]}
