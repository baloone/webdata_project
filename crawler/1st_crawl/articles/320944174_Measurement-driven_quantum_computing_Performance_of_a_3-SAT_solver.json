{"id":"320944174_Measurement-driven_quantum_computing_Performance_of_a_3-SAT_solver","abstract":"We investigate the performance of a quantum algorithm for solving classical 3-SAT problems. A cycle of post-selected measurements drives the computer's register monotonically toward a steady state which is correlated to the classical solution(s). An internal parameter $\\theta$ determines both the degree of correlation and the success probability, thus controlling the algorithm's runtime. Optionally this parameter can be gradually evolved during the algorithm's execution to create a Zeno-like effect; this can be viewed as an adiabatic evolution of a Hamiltonian which remains frustration-free at all points, and we lower-bound the corresponding gap. In exact numerical simulations of small systems up to 34 qubits our approach competes favourably with a high-performing classical 3-SAT solver, which itself outperforms a brute-force application of Grover's search.","authors":["Simon Charles Benjamin","Zhao Liming","Joseph Fitzsimons"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["310953010_On_preparing_ground_states_of_gapped_Hamiltonians_An_efficient_Quantum_Lov'asz_Local_Lemma","256530600_Measurement-based_quantum_computation","234765968_Quantum_search_algorithms","220432358_An_improved_exponential-time_algorithm_for_k_-SAT","7797110_Rigorous_location_of_phase_transitions_in_hard_optimization_problems","317417651_Measurement-driven_analog_of_adiabatic_quantum_computation_for_frustration-free_Hamiltonians","284167206_Universal_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation_via_the_Space-Time_Circuit-to-Hamiltonian_Construction","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","281487527_Performance_of_a_measurement-driven_'adiabatic-like'_quantum_3-SAT_solver","259117873_Quantum_computation_and_quantum-state_engineering_driven_by_dissipation","238668401_Efficient_algorithm_for_a_quantum_analogue_of_2SAT","221499473_A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_k-SAT_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","3921136_How_powerful_is_adiabatic_quantum_computation","3801351_Complexity_of_k-SAT","2187810_Quantum_search_by_measurement","2184005_Quantum_Computation_by_Adiabatic_Evolution"]}
