{"id":"312930118_Correlation_Analysis_between_Journal_Metrics_and_Subscription_Price_for_Selected_Journals","abstract":"Annotation.\nThe given article gives an account on the correlation analysis between the journal metrics (SNIP, SJR, IF) and the subscription price for two groups of journals (114 Economics journals and 150 Mathematics and Computer Science journals) which were presented on Elsevier website in October 2016.\nIt was obtained that the correlation coefficients of the given journal metrics for the second group of journals were considerably lower in comparison with the first group of journals. It is due to the fact that the sales of Mathematics and Computer Science journals are less commercialized as compared to the sales of Economics journals. It was concluded that the lack of strong correlation between journal metrics and subscription price at the market of scientific periodicals is generally due to the fact that this kind of market is not elastic and over monopolized.","authors":["Vladimir M Moskovkin","Alla A.
