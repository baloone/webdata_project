{"id":"353285499_Applications_of_Graph_Coloring_and_Labeling_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"Graphs theory plays a vital role in various fields. Graph concepts are used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and information systems. The use of graph theory concepts is also seen in different research areas of computer science like Network, Database management system, Artificial intelligence, Software architecture, Design of algorithms, Multiprocessing, Data structure, image processing etc. This paper mainly concentrates on applications that uses graph coloring and graph labeling concept.","authors":["Vinutha Ms","Arathi Puranik"],"meta":["August 2017"],"references":["228627540_Graph-Based_and_Structural_Methods_for_Fingerprint_Classification","3193287_Introduction_to_the_special_section_on_graph_algorithms_in_computer_vision","3049712_Constructing_a_Message-Pruning_Tree_with_Minimum_Cost_for_Tracking_Moving_Objects_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Is_NP-Complete_and_an_Enhanced_Data_Aggregation_Structure","321009812_GRAPH_THEORY_WITH_APPLICATIONS_TO_ENGINEERING_AND_COMPUTER_SCIENCE","289747465_New_algorithm_for_analyzing_performance_of_neighborhood_strategies_in_solving_job_shop_scheduling_problems","4125985_Connected_K-coverage_problem_in_sensor_networks","3046711_A_Graph_Model_for_Fault-Tolerant_Computing","2910750_Graph_Coloring_Problems_and_Their_Applications_in_Scheduling"]}
