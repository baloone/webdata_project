{"id":"338939306_Adoption_of_Precision_Farming_Tools_The_Case_of_Italian_Farmers","abstract":"The process of adopting innovation, especially with regard to precision farming (PF), is inherently complex and social, and influenced by producers, change agents, social norms and organizational pressure. An empirical analysis was conducted among Italian farmers to measure the drivers and clarify “bottlenecks” in the adoption of agricultural innovation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the socio-structural and complexity factors that affect the probability to adopt innovations and the determinants that drive an individual’s decisions. Preliminary results found high levels of adoption among younger farmers, those that had a high level of education, those with high intensity of information, with large farm sizes, and high labor intensity. A logit model was used to understand the role played by labor intensity and perceived in the adoption process. In light of the Common Agricultural Policy Reform post 2020, the findings suggest relevant policy implications, such as the need to increase awareness of PF tools and foster dissemination of information aimed at reducing the degree of perceived complexity.","authors":["Yari Vecchio","Giulio Paolo Agnusdei","Pier Paolo Miglietta","Fabian Capitanio"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 17(3):869","DOI:10.3390/ijerph17030869"],"references":["338247911_Drivers_of_farmers'_adoption_and_continuation_of_climate-smart_agricultural_practices_A_study_from_northeastern_Italy","333347877_The_Effects_of_Individual_Variables_Farming_System_Characteristics_and_Perceived_Barriers_on_Actual_Use_of_Smart_Farming_Technologies_Evidence_from_the_Piedmont_Region_Northwestern_Italy","332753855_Factors_affecting_ICT_adoption_in_Agriculture_a_case_study_in_Italy","332729338_A_Survey_of_Italian_Dairy_Farmers'_Propensity_for_Precision_Livestock_Farming_Tools","332648434_Precision_Farming_at_the_Nexus_of_Agricultural_Production_and_the_Environment","320550017_A_Short_History_of_the_Evolution_of_the_Climate_Smart_Agriculture_Approach_and_Its_Links_to_Climate_Change_and_Sustainable_Agriculture_Debates","320353627_Qualitative_research_design_An_interactive_approach","319998246_Sampling_Methods_in_Research_Methodology_How_to_Choose_a_Sampling_Technique_for_Research","317719321_Predicting_farmer_uptake_of_new_agricultural_practices_A_tool_for_research_extension_and_policy","339770805_Adoption_of_precision_farming_tools_A_context-related_analysis"]}
