{"id":"234021387_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management_The_Value_of_Different_Paradigms","abstract":"This paper argues that discussion of the strategic management of human resources has been limited by a confusion over the analysis of SHRM and an inadequate conception of the field for SHRM. By separating out the universalistic and con-textualist paradigms, the paper clarifies the differences in approach and how these affect views of the nature, levels and actors in the subject area. Siting itself in the contextualist paradigm, the paper draws attention to the value of that approach in understanding current developments in SHRM in Europe.1","authors":["Chris Brewster"],"meta":["January 1999Management International Review 39(3):45-64","DOI:10.1007/978-3-322-90993-0_5"],"references":["313497974_Linking_competitive_strategies_with_human_resource_management_practices","312970457_HR_as_a_source_of_shareholder_value_Research_and_recommendations","279600306_Gender_and_international_human_resource_management","258188683_The_Culture-Free_Context_of_Organization_Structure_A_Tri-National_Comparison","258134596_Globalization_Labour_Flexibility_and_Insecurity_The_Era_of_Market_Regulation","254299198_Human_resource_management_in_Europe_Evidence_from_ten_countries","247569555_Evolution_of_Concept_and_Practice_in_Personnel_AdministrationHuman_Resource_Management_PAHRM","246701207_Linking_Competitive_Strategies_with_Human_Resource_Management_Practices","344904356_Information_Incentives_and_Bargaining_in_the_Japanese_Economy_A_Microtheory_of_the_Japanese_Economy","318883323_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Strategic_Planning","315385191_Human_Resource_Management","313202694_Theoretical_perspectives_for_strategic_human_resource_management","312578899_The_manager's_job_folklore_and_fact","311643063_HRM_Rhetoric_reality_and_hidden_agendas","308043576_Strategic_human_resources_management_and_planning","301206801_Flexible_Working_in_Europe_A_Review_of_the_Evidence","300386812_A_Contingency_Model_of_HRM-Strategy_Empirical_Research_Findings_Reconsidered","292809822_Tie_the_corporate_knot_Gaining_complete_customer_commitment","291290190_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","286681391_Organizational_capability_as_a_competitive_advantage_Human_resource_professionals_as_strategic_partners","285965402_The_Competitive_Advantage_of_Nations","285773812_Human_resources_and_organizational_performance_Progress_and_prospects","285214744_Strategic_change_Logical_incrementalism","284991154_Gestion_des_RH_en_Europe_donnees_comparees","284536394_Developments_in_the_Management_of_Human_Resources","280696811_Mixing_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Methods_Triangulation_in_Action","279468291_Like_Nature_Industrial_Relations_Abhors_a_Vaccum_The_Case_of_the_Union-Free_Strategy","279057125_HRM_A_Case_of_the_Wolf_in_Sheep's_Clothing","271517443_The_Competitive_Advantage_Of_Nations","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","267922098_Strategies_for_Change_Logical_Incrementalism","265150274_Strategic_Human_Resources_Management_A_Review_of_the_Literature_and_a_Proposed_Typology","258943585_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management","258154336_Theoretical_Perspectives_for_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management","256641904_Toward_an_Integrative_View_of_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management","256386696_Human_resources_strategy_Focusing_on_issues_and_actions","254299343_Human_Resource_Management_in_Turbulent_Times_HRM_in_the_Czech_Republic","254299242_The_significance_of_human_resource_management_A_reconsideration_of_the_evidence","248040183_The_Transformation_of_American_Industrial_Relations","247733800_Strategic_Fit_and_the_Societal_Effect_Interpreting_Cross-National_Comparisons_of_Technology_Organization_and_Human_Resources","247410150_Right_enough_to_be_dangerously_wrong_an_analysis_of_In_Search_of_excellence_phenomenon","247142321_Strategic_Human_Resource_Management_Linking_the_people_with_the_strategic_needs_of_the_business","245584690_Beyond_the_Workplace_Managing_Industrial_Relations_in_the_Multi-Establishment_Enterprise","243765454_Made_In_America_-Regaining_the_Productive_Edge","240080970_Labor_and_Monopoly_Capital","239486792_Country_Competitiveness_Technology_and_the_Organization_of_Work","235305910_A_comparative_analysis_of_the_link_between_flexibility_and_HRM_strategy","235277580_Human_Resource_Aspects_Decentralization_and_Devolution","235274634_Human_Resource_Management_A_European_Perspective","234021463_Modes_of_theorizing_in_strategic_human_resource_management_Tests_of_universalistic_contingency_and_configurational_performance_predictions","234021325_The_Impact_of_Human_Resource_Management_on_Organizational_Performance","228215412_The_Impact_of_Human_Resource_Management_Practices_on_Turnover_and_Productivity","233965881_Developments_in_the_Management_of_Human_Resources_An_Analytical_Review","230557640_The_Science_Of_'Muddling_Through","229506829_Improving_Labor_Productivity_Human_Resource_Management_Policies_Do_Matter"]}
