{"id":"252431282_Loop_antennas_for_directive_transmission_into_a_material_half_space","abstract":"The horizontal circular loop and the coaxial array of loops above a material half space are analyzed as antennas for directive transmission into the half space, such as when the loops are located in air with the directive transmission into the earth. The far-zone field patterns and directivities of these antennas placed over lossless dielectrics are studied first when determining the optimum geometry for the single loop and the array. It is determined that the directive properties for the lossless dielectric are indicative of those for the same antenna over a medium with low loss when proper account is taken of the exponential attenuation experienced in the lossy medium. The maximum directivities for these antennas are obtained utilizing parametric studies. For the single loop of resonant size, the optimum height over the interface is obtained, and for the two-element array consisting of a driven loop of resonant size with a single parasite, the optimum size and spacing of the parasitic reflector are determined. Measured electric field patterns and gains of model antennas above an interface between air and fresh water are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results.","authors":["Glenn S.
