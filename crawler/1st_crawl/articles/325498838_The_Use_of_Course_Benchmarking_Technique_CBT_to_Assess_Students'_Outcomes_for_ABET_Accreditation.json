However, educational program accreditation, in general, and ABET accreditation, in particular, could be daunting process which requires considerable time, effort and resources. This paper describes the implementation, use, and applicability of an effective, efficient and sustainable assessment method used by the Computer Science and Information Systems (CSIS) department at the American University of Kuwait (AUK) known as Course Benchmarking Technique (CBT). Other educational institutions seeking ABET program accreditation could benefit from utilizing this assessment method.","authors":["Ahmad Rabaa'i","Aaron R Rababaah"],"meta":["June 2018","Conference: The 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering FECS'16 â€“ I24-28 of July 2016, Las Vegas, USA."],"references":["258792942_A_Successful_Experience_of_ABET_Accreditation_of_an_Electrical_Engineering_Program","220807301_Principles_of_curriculum_design_and_revision_a_case_study_in_implementing_computing_curricula_CC2001","345924729_Abet_Accreditation_Best_Practices_For_Assessment","234812918_Using_outcomes-based_assessment_data_to_improve_assessment_and_instruction_a_case_study","234779855_Effective_course-based_learning_outcome_assessment_for_ABET_accreditation_of_computing_programs","221538694_Outcomes-based_computing_accreditation_program_assessment","221536876_Computer_science_accreditation_the_advantages_of_being_different","220612796_Developing_and_maintaining_an_effective_assessment_program"]}
