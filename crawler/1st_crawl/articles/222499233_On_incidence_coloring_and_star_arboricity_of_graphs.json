{"id":"222499233_On_incidence_coloring_and_star_arboricity_of_graphs","abstract":"In this note we show that the concept of incidence coloring introduced by Brualdi and Massey [4] is a special case of directed star arboricity, introduced by Agor and Alon [2]. A conjecture in [4] concerning asymptotics of the incidence coloring number is solved in the negative following an example in [2]. We generalize a result in [3] concerning the star arboricity of graphs to the directed case by a slight modification of their proof, to give the same asymptotic bound as in the undirected case. As a result, we get tight asymptotic bounds for the maximum incidence coloring number of a graph in terms of its degree.","authors":["Barry Guiduli"],"meta":["January 1997Discrete Mathematics 163(1-3):275-278","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(95)00342-T","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265681632_Problems_and_results_on_3-chromatic_Hypergraphs_and_some_related_questions","244487249_Path_factors_of_a_graph","222769578_The_Star_Arboricity_of_Graphs","220441740_Star_arboricity","220192907_Incidence_and_strong_colorings_of_graphs"]}
