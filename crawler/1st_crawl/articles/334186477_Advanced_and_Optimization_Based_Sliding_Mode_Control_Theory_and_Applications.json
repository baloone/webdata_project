{"id":"334186477_Advanced_and_Optimization_Based_Sliding_Mode_Control_Theory_and_Applications","abstract":"A compendium of the authors' recently published results, this book discusses sliding mode control of uncertain nonlinear systems, with a particular emphasis on advanced and optimization based algorithms. The authors survey classical sliding mode control theory and introduce four new methods of advanced sliding mode control. They analyze classical theory and advanced algorithms, with numerical results complementing the theoretical treatment. Case studies examine applications of the algorithms to complex robotics and power grid problems.\n\nAdvanced and Optimization Based Sliding Mode Control: Theory and Applications is the first book to systematize the theory of optimization based higher order sliding mode control and illustrate advanced algorithms and their applications to real problems. It presents systematic treatment of event-triggered and model based event-triggered sliding mode control schemes, including schemes in combination with model predictive control, and presents adaptive algorithms as well as algorithms capable of dealing with state and input constraints. Additionally, the book includes simulations and experimental results obtained by applying the presented control strategies to real complex systems.","authors":["Antonella Ferrara","Gian Paolo Incremona","Michele Cucuzzella"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611975840","Publisher: Society for Industrial and Applied MathematicsISBN: 978-1-61197-583-3"],"references":[]}
