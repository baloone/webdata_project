{"id":"270878429_Information_Extraction_over_Structured_Data_Question_Answering_with_Freebase","abstract":"Answering natural language questions using the Freebase knowledge base has recently been explored as a platform for advancing the state of the art in open domain semantic parsing. Those efforts map questions to sophisticated meaning representations that are then attempted to be matched against viable answer candidates in the knowledge base. Here we show that relatively modest information extraction techniques, when paired with a webscale corpus, can outperform these sophisticated approaches by roughly 34% relative gain.","authors":["Xuchen Yao","Benjamin Van Durme"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.3115/v1/P14-1090","Conference: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"],"references":["267557990_Natural_Language_Questions_for_the_Web_of_Data","260624024_Finding_needles_in_the_haystack_Search_and_candidate_generation","254008885_Template-based_question_answering_over_RDF_data","240615221_SPARQL_Template-Based_Question_Answering","240615207_Question_Answering_on_Interlinked_Data","230875890_The_Mathematics_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Parameter_Estimation","228976696_Convergence_of_translation_memory_and_statistical_machine_translation","221466796_DBpedia_A_Nucleus_for_a_Web_of_Open_Data","221022617_YAGO2_Exploring_and_Querying_World_Knowledge_in_Time_Space_Context_and_Many_Languages","220874055_Using_String-Kernels_for_Learning_Semantic_Parsers","220482883_NLTK_the_Natural_Language_Toolkit","220473763_A_Survey_of_Approaches_to_Automatic_Schema_Matching","220430076_Question_answering_from_structured_knowledge_sources","220355311_Unsupervised_Multilingual_Sentence_Boundary_Detection","51942217_Learning_Dependency-Based_Compositional_Semantics","42799287_AquaLog_An_Ontology-Portable_Question_Answering_System_for_the_Semantic_Web","2876877_A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Various_Statistical_Alignment_Models","307174794_Statistical_Machine_Translation","289614552_Scaling_semantic_parsers_with_on-the-fly_ontology_matching","282162224_Semantic_parsing_on_freebase_from_question-answer_pairs","270877947_Large-scale_Semantic_Parsing_via_Schema_Matching_and_Lexicon_Extension","270877442_Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering","267026725_FACC1_Freebase_annotation_of_ClueWeb_corpora_Version_1_Release_date_2013-06-26_Format_version_1_Correction_level_0","262425032_Weakly_supervised_training_of_semantic_parsers","262219881_Semantic_parsing_with_Bayesian_tree_transducers","261180225_Ontology_Matching","234816750_Ontological_promiscuity","230876691_Baseball_An_Automatic_Question_Answerer","230876272_Lunar_Rocks_in_Natural_English_Explorations_in_Natural_Language_Question_Answering","228333647_Learning_to_Map_Sentences_to_Logical_Form_Structured_Classificationwith_Probabilistic_Categorial_Grammars","223090618_Question_answering_from_structured_knowledge_sources","221606234_Learning_to_Interpret_Natural_Language_Navigation_Instructions_from_Observations","221213308_Freebase_A_collaboratively_created_graph_database_for_structuring_human_knowledge","221112397_Using_Multiple_Clause_Constructors_in_Inductive_Logic_Programming_for_Semantic_Parsing","221013098_Lexical_Generalization_in_CCG_Grammar_Induction_for_Semantic_Parsing","221012950_Identifying_Relations_for_Open_Information_Extraction","221012890_Online_Learning_of_Relaxed_CCG_Grammars_for_Parsing_to_Logical_Form","220873714_Learning_Synchronous_Grammars_for_Semantic_Parsing_with_Lambda_Calculus","220873595_Learning_Context-Dependent_Mappings_from_Sentences_to_Logical_Form","215992284_Inducing_Probabilistic_CCG_Grammars_from_Logical_Form_with_Higher-Order_Unification"]}
