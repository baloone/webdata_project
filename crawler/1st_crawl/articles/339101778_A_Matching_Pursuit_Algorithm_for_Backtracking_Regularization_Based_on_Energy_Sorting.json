{"id":"339101778_A_Matching_Pursuit_Algorithm_for_Backtracking_Regularization_Based_on_Energy_Sorting","abstract":"The signal reconstruction quality has become a critical factor in compressed sensing at present. This paper proposes a matching pursuit algorithm for backtracking regularization based on energy sorting. This algorithm uses energy sorting for secondary atom screening to delete individual wrong atoms through the regularized orthogonal matching pursuit (ROMP) algorithm backtracking. The support set is continuously updated and expanded during each iteration. While the signal energy distribution is not uniform, or the energy distribution is in an extreme state, the reconstructive performance of the ROMP algorithm becomes unstable if the maximum energy is still taken as the selection criterion. The proposed method for the regularized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm can be adopted to improve those drawbacks in signal reconstruction due to its high reconstruction efficiency. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a proper reconstruction.","authors":["Hanfei Zhang","Shungen Xiao","Ping Zhou"],"meta":["February 2020Symmetry 12(2):231","DOI:10.3390/sym12020231"],"references":["338032697_Coupling_rub-impact_dynamics_of_double_translational_joints_with_subsidence_for_time-varying_load_in_a_planar_mechanical_system","317768727_Automatic_detection_of_P-_and_S-wave_arrival_times_new_strategies_based_on_the_modified_fractal_method_and_basic_matching_pursuit","314463000_Application_of_pattern_recognition_in_gear_faults_based_on_the_matching_pursuit_of_a_characteristic_waveform","334853623_Numerical_analysis_of_the_dynamic_behavior_of_a_rotor-bearing-brush_seal_system_with_bristle_interference","333161805_A_novel_nano_perfluoro_ionic_liquid_as_an_efficient_catalyst_in_the_synthesis_of_chromenes_under_mild_and_solvent-free_conditions","332337716_A_COMPARISON_OF_THE_DIAGNOSTIC_VALUE_OF_MAGNETIC_RESONANCE_MAMMOGRAPHY_VERSUS_ULTRASOUND_MAMMOGRAPHY_IN_MODERATE-_AND_HIGH-RISK_BREAST_CANCER_PATIENTS","331865224_An_improved_algorithm_for_basis_pursuit_problem_and_its_applications","331716888_Nonlinear_dynamic_response_of_reciprocating_compressor_system_with_rub-impact_fault_caused_by_subsidence","322921041_A_direct_inversion_for_brittleness_index_based_on_GLI_with_basic-pursuit_decomposition","320089413_An_Improved_RIP-Based_Performance_Guarantee_for_Sparse_Signal_Recovery_via_Simultaneous_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit"]}
