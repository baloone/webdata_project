{"id":"262331246_Code_Club_Bringing_programming_to_UK_primary_schools_through_scratch","abstract":"Code Club is a network of after-school programming clubs for primary (US: elementary) schoolchildren, run by technically-competent volunteers in conjunction with (generally technically-unskilled) teachers. The main motivation of Code Club is to inspire children with a sense of fun and achievement for programming and digital creativity. This paper reports on the first year of Code Club in 1000 UK schools. The results were extremely positive, but some children had difficulty understanding the concepts behind the projects.","authors":["Neil Smith","Clare Sutcliffe","Linda Sandvik"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1145/2538862.2538919","Conference: Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education"],"references":["262310824_Using_Robotics_to_Motivate_'Back_Door'_Learning","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","221537160_Programming_by_Choice_Urban_Youth_Learning_Programming_with_Scratch","285970744_Motivation_project-based_learning_Sustaining_the_doing_supporting_the_learning","254006887_What_do_students_learn_about_programming_from_game_music_video_and_storytelling_projects","241279577_Children_learning_computer_science_concepts_via_Alice_game-programming","237063312_Shut_Down_or_Restart_The_Way_Forward_for_Computing_in_UK_Schools","232543390_Motivating_Project-Based_Learning_Sustaining_the_Doing_Supporting_the_Learning","228647723_Attitudes_towards_computer_science-computing_experiences_as_a_starting_point_and_barrier_to_computer_science","222400176_Computer-game_Construction_A_Gender-neutral_Attractor_to_Computing_Science"]}
