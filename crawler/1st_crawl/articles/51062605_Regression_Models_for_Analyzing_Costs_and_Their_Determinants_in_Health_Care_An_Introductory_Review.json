{"id":"51062605_Regression_Models_for_Analyzing_Costs_and_Their_Determinants_in_Health_Care_An_Introductory_Review","abstract":"This article aims to describe the various approaches in multivariable modelling of healthcare costs data and to synthesize the respective criticisms as proposed in the literature.\nWe present regression methods suitable for the analysis of healthcare costs and then apply them to an experimental setting in cardiovascular treatment (COSTAMI study) and an observational setting in diabetes hospital care.\nWe show how methods can produce different results depending on the degree of matching between the underlying assumptions of each method and the specific characteristics of the healthcare problem.\nThe matching of healthcare cost models to the analytic objectives and characteristics of the data available to a study requires caution. The study results and interpretation can be heavily dependent on the choice of model with a real risk of spurious results and conclusions.","authors":["Dario Gregori","Michele Petrinco","Simona bo","Alessandro Desideri"],"meta":["June 2011International Journal for Quality in Health Care 23(3):331-41","DOI:10.1093/intqhc/mzr010","SourcePubMed"],"references":["342010485_Editorial_Some_reflections_on_cost-effectiveness_analysis","313197115_A_generalization_of_sampling_without_replacement_from_finite_population","305296957_Net_Health_Benefits_A_New_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_Uncertainty_in_Cost-Effectiveness_Analysis","305296869_Predicting_the_Cost_of_Illness_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Models_Applied_to_Stroke","297857435_Constructing_confidence_intervals_for_cost-effectiveness_ratios_An_evaluation_of_parametric_and_non-parametric_techniques_using_Monte_Carlo_simulation","297546787_A_Bayesian_approach_to_stochastic_cost-effectiveness_analysis","277694888_Confidence_interval_for_cost_effectiveness_ratios","277000611_Incorporation_of_Uncertainty_in_Health_Economic_Modelling_Studies","272289176_The_Negative_Side_of_Cost-effectiveness_Analysis","256557505_Tobit_Models_A_Survey"]}
