{"id":"348673871_ITER_cold_VDEs_in_the_limit_of_perfectly_conducting_walls","abstract":"Recently, it has been shown that a vertical displacement event (VDE) can occur in ITER even when the walls are perfect conductors, as a consequence of the current quench (CQ) [A. H. Boozer, Phys. Plasmas 26, 114501 (2019)]. We used the extended-MHD code M3D-CÂ¹ with an ITER-like equilibrium and induced a CQ to explore cold VDEs in the limit of perfectly conducting walls, using different wall geometries. In the case of a rectangular first wall with the side walls far away from the plasma, we obtained very good agreement with the analytical model developed by Boozer that considers a top/bottom flat-plates wall. We show that the solution in which the plasma remains at the initial equilibrium position is improved when bringing the side walls closer to the plasma. When approximating the ITER first wall as a perfect conductor, the plasma remains stable at the initial equilibrium position far beyond the value predicted by the flat-plates wall limit. When considering an opposite limit in which only the inner shell of the ITER vacuum vessel acts as a perfect conductor, the plasma is displaced during the CQ, but the edge safety factor remains above 2 longer in the current decay compared to the flat-plates wall limit. In all the simulated cases, the VDE is found to be strongly dependent on the plasma current, in agreement with a similar finding in the flat-plates wall limit, showing an important difference with hot VDEs in which the CQ is not a necessary condition.","authors":["Cesar Clauser","S.C.
