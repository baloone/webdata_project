{"id":"341353053_Model-Free_Cluster_Analysis_of_Physical_Property_Data_using_Information_Maximizing_Self-Argument_Training","abstract":"We present semi-supervised information maximizing self-argument training (IMSAT), a neural network-based classification method that works without the preparation of labeled data. Semi-supervised IMSAT can amplify specific differences and avoid undesirable misclassification in accordance with the purpose. We demonstrate that semi-supervised IMSAT has a comparable performance with existing methods for semi-supervised learning of image classification and can also classify real experimental data (X-ray diffraction patterns and thermoelectric hysteresis curves) in the same way even though their shape and dimensions are different. Our algorithm will contribute to the automation of big data processing and artificial intelligence-driven material development.","authors":["Ryohto Sawada","Yuma Iwasaki","Masahiko Ishida"],"meta":["May 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-64281-0"],"references":["331362461_Machine-learning_guided_discovery_of_a_new_thermoelectric_material","320337544_Stochastic_Neural_Network_Approach_for_Learning_High-Dimensional_Free_Energy_Surfaces","314115770_Learning_Discrete_Representations_via_Information_Maximizing_Self_Augmented_Training","313243636_Comparison_of_dissimilarity_measures_for_cluster_analysis_of_X-ray_diffraction_data_from_combinatorial_libraries","333708316_Neural_network_based_classification_of_crystal_symmetries_from_x-ray_diffraction_patterns","314260711_Weight-averaged_consistency_targets_improve_semi-supervised_deep_learning_results","303859227_Solving_the_Quantum_Many-Body_Problem_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks","288388245_Fabrication_and_thermoelectricity_of_La1-xCa_RE_xVO3_x_1_composition-spread_films","285924191_Crystal_Structure_Refinement_A_Crystallographer's_Guide_to_SHELXL","250196686_Development_of_multifunctional_thin_films_using_high-throughput_experimentation_methods","228655277_Data_management_and_visualization_of_x-ray_diffraction_spectra_from_thin_film_ternary_composition_spreads","247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","227685959_Data_Analysis_in_Combinatorial_Experiments_Applying_Supervised_Principal_Component_Technique_to_Investigate_the_Relationship_Between_ToF-SIMS_Spectra_and_the_Composition_Distribution_of_Ternary_Metall","223434233_Identification_of_amorphous_phases_in_the_Fe-Ni-Co_ternary_alloy_system_using_continuous_phase_diagram_material_chips","51918116_Spin_Caloritronics"]}
