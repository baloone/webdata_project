{"id":"261484776_A_Self-timed_Ring_Based_True_Random_Number_Generator","abstract":"Self-timed rings are oscillators in which several events can evolve evenly-spaced in time thanks to analog effects inherent to the ring stage structure. One of their interesting features is that they provide precise high-speed multiphase signals. This paper presents a true random number generator that exploits the jitter of events propagating in a self-timed ring with a high entropy. Designs implemented in Alter a Cyclone III and Xilinx Virtex 5 devices provide high quality random bit sequNIST SP 800-22 statistical testsences passing FIPS 140-1 and NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests at a high bit rate.","authors":["Abdelkarim Cherkaoui","Viktor Fischer","Alain Aubert","Laurent Fesquet"],"meta":["May 2013Proceedings of the International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","DOI:10.1109/ASYNC.2013.15","Conference: Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC), 2013 IEEE 19th International Symposium on"],"references":["254023821_Comparison_of_Self-Timed_Ring_and_Inverter_Ring_Oscillators_as_Entropy_Sources_in_FPGAs","226148194_High-Speed_True_Random_Number_Generation_with_Logic_Gates_Only","221291959_True_Random_Number_Generator_Embedded_in_Reconfigurable_Hardware","50231963_True-Randomness_and_Pseudo-Randomness_in_Ring_Oscillator-Based_True_Random_Number_Generators","305302081_A_Million_Random_Digits_with_100000_Normal_Deviates","224213481_A_novel_High-Speed_Multi-phase_Oscillator_Using_Self-Timed_Rings","221355138_An_LSI_random_number_generator_RNG","221291589_High-Speed_True_Random_Number_Generation_with_Logic_Gates_Only","220331462_A_Provably_Secure_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Built-In_Tolerance_to_Active_Attacks","200775549_Micropipelines"]}
