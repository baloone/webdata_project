{"id":"329587092_Caterpillar_A_Blockchain-Based_Business_Process_Management_System","abstract":"This demonstration introduces Caterpillar, an open-source Business Process Management System (BPMS) that runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Like any BPMS, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model (captured in the Business Process Model and Notation – BPMN) and allows users to track the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the Ethereum blockchain, and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The compiler supports a wide array of BPMN constructs, including user, script and service tasks, parallel and exclusive gateways, subprocesses, multi-instance activities and event handlers. The target audience of this demonstration includes researchers in the area of business process management and blockchain technology.","authors":["Orlenys López Pintado"],"meta":["September 2017","Conference: Proceedings of the BPM Demo Track and BPM Dissertation Award co-located with 15th International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2017)At: Barcelona, Spain"],"references":[]}
