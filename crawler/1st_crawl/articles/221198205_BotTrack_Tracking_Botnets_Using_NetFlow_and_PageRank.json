{"id":"221198205_BotTrack_Tracking_Botnets_Using_NetFlow_and_PageRank","abstract":"With large scale botnets emerging as one of the major current threats, the automatic detection of botnet traffic is of high\nimportance for service providers and large campus network monitoring. Faced with high speed network connections, detecting\nbotnets must be efficient and accurate. This paper proposes a novel approach for this task, where NetFlow related data is\ncorrelated and a host dependency model is leveraged for advanced data mining purposes. We extend the popular linkage analysis \nalgorithm PageRank [27] with an additional clustering process in order to efficiently detect stealthy botnets using peer-to-peer\ncommunication infrastructures and not exhibiting large volumes of traffic. The key conceptual component in our approach is\nto analyze communication behavioral patterns and to infer potential botnet activities.","authors":["Jérôme François","Shaonan Wang","Radu State","Thomas Engel"],"meta":["May 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-20757-0_1","SourceDBLP","Conference: NETWORKING 2011 - 10th International IFIP TC 6 Networking Conference, Valencia, Spain, May 9-13, 2011, Proceedings, Part I"],"references":["270960169_A_Multi-Perspective_Analysis_of_the_Storm_Peacomm_Worm","269034016_What's_going_on","251885500_Actively_Measuring_Bots_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","246597611_Kademlia_A_peer-to-peer_information_system_based_on_the_XOR_metric","245662146_Cisco_Systems_NetFlow_Services_Export_Version_9","243766888_RFC_1459_Internet_relay_chat_protocol","239595761_Chord_a_peer-to-peer_lookup_service_for_internet_applications","234789454_Spamming_botnets_Signatures_and_characteristics","234780005_BotHunter_Detecting_Malware_Infection_Through_IDSDriven_Dialog_Correlation","234759472_Wide-scale_botnet_detection_and_characterization"]}
