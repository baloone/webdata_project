{"id":"310509107_A_Graph_Repository_for_Learning_Error-Tolerant_Graph_Matching","abstract":"In the last years, efforts in the pattern recognition field have been especially focused on developing systems that use graph based representations. To that aim, some graph repositories have been presented to test graph-matching algorithms or to learn some parameters needed on such algorithms. The aim of these tests has always been to increase the recognition ratio in a classification framework. Nevertheless, some graph-matching applications are not solely intended for classification purposes, but to detect similarities between the local parts of the objects that they represent. Thus, current state of the art repositories provide insufficient information. We present a graph repository structure such that each register is not only composed of a graph and its class, but also of a pair of graphs and a ground-truth correspondence between them, as well as their class. This repository structure is useful to analyse and develop graph-matching algorithms and to learn their parameters in a broadly manner. We present seven different databases, which are publicly available, with these structure and present some quality measures experimented on them.","authors":["Carlos Francisco Moreno-García","Xavier Cortés Llosa","Francesc Serratosa"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49055-7_46","Conference: S+SSPR 2016 - Structural, Syntactic, and Statistical Pattern Recognition"],"references":["288517268_Consensus_of_Two_Graph_Correspondences_Through_a_Generalisation_of_the_Bipartite_Graph_Matching","283619077_Learning_Graph_Matching_Substitution_Weights_Based_on_the_Ground_Truth_Node_Correspondence","273169802_Speeding_up_Fast_Bipartite_Graph_Matching_Through_a_New_Cost_Matrix","262524340_Graph_Matching_and_Learning_in_Pattern_Recognition_in_the_Last_10_Years","243785395_A_Database_of_Graphs_for_Isomorphism_and_Sub-Graph_Isomorphism_Benchmarking","237148816_On_the_Graph_Edit_Distance_cost_Properties_and_Applications","220654831_A_survey_of_graph_edit_distance","220359828_Second-Order_Random_Graphs_For_Modeling_Sets_Of_Attributed_Graphs_And_Their_Application_To_Object_Learning_And_Recognition","220359794_Thirty_Years_Of_Graph_Matching_In_Pattern_Recognition","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","313524174_From_contours_to_3D_object_detection_and_pose_estimation","308281248_Obtaining_the_Consensus_of_Multiple_Correspondences_between_Graphs_through_Online_Learning","291697504_STRING_MATCHING_FOR_STRUCTURAL_PATTERN_RECOGNITION","284002132_Online_learning_the_consensus_of_multiple_correspondences_between_sets","281467101_Consensus_of_Multiple_Correspondences_between_Sets_of_Elements","279754741_Computation_of_Graph_Edit_Distance_Reasoning_about_Optimality_and_Speed-up","277969025_Correspondence_consensus_of_two_sets_of_correspondences_through_optimisation_functions","277132559_A_Graph_Database_Repository_and_Performance_Evaluation_Metrics_for_Graph_Edit_Distance","271710860_Learning_graph-matching_edit-costs_based_on_the_optimality_of_the_oracle's_node_correspondences","262524617_A_long_trip_in_the_charming_world_of_graphs_for_Pattern_Recognition","262491753_Fast_computation_of_Bipartite_graph_matching","238758978_A_distance_measure_between_attributed_relational_graphs_for_pattern_recognition","235847077_Smooth_point-set_registration_using_neighboring_constraints","235845291_Smooth_point-set_registration_using_neighborin_constraints","224377906_Entropy_and_Distance_of_Random_Graphs_with_Application_to_Structural_Pattern_Recognition","223845870_Function-described_graphs_for_modelling_objects_represented_by_sets_of_attributed_graphs","222925711_Allermann_G_Inexact_graph_matching_for_structural_pattern_recognition_Pattern_Recognition_Letters_14_245-253","222647315_Automatic_learning_of_cost_functions_for_graph_edit_distance","222134741_Approximate_graph_edit_distance_computation_by_means_of_bipartite_graph_matching","221275925_IAM_Graph_Database_Repository_for_Graph_Based_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning","221111398_From_contours_to_3D_object_detection_and_pose_estimation","220660194_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Graph_Matching","220644325_A_large_database_of_graphs_and_its_use_for_benchmarking_graph_isomorphism_algorithms","220134986_A_new_graph_matching_method_for_point-set_correspondence_using_the_EM_algorithm_and_Softassign","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","51866282_Robust_and_Efficient_Ridge-Based_Palmprint_Matching","45821308_Multifeature-Based_High-Resolution_Palmprint_Recognition","24283466_Learning_Graph_Matching","7771437_Self-Organizing_Maps_for_Learning_the_Edit_Costs_in_Graph_Matching","6806978_Graphical_Models_and_Point_Pattern_Matching","3193285_Symbol_Recognition_by_Error-Tolerant_Subgraph_Matching_between_Region_Adjacency_Graphs","3192582_Real-time_matching_system_for_large_fingerprint_databases"]}
