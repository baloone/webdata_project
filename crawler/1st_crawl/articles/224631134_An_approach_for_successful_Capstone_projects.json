{"id":"224631134_An_approach_for_successful_Capstone_projects","abstract":"Capstone design courses provide students with the opportunity to use their problem solving skills and the technical knowledge they gain throughout their college experience to develop a device or system that meets some specific requirements. While the process for conducting such courses varies between programs and disciplines, such projects normally take two or three semesters to complete and in the majority of cases, students are organized in teams of two or more. This paper describes the changes describes an approach that has resulted in successful projects","authors":["Rafic Bachnak"],"meta":["November 2005Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference","DOI:10.1109/FIE.2005.1612138","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Frontiers in Education, 2005.
