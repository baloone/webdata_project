{"id":"262215215_Solving_Trivium-based_Boolean_Equations_Using_the_Method_of_Syllogisms","abstract":"The article examines a practical application of the method of syllogisms to solve a system of Boolean equations arising in the cryptanalysis of the stream cipher Trivium. Experimental results show that different guessing strategies lead to significantly different complexities of generic attacks. A new experimental approach is presented that can be used to estimate lower bounds on the complexity of such attacks.
