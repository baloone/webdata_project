{"id":"227757068_Self-efficacy_goal_orientation_and_fear_of_failure_as_predictors_of_school_engagement_in_high_school_students","abstract":"Lack of school engagement among adolescents in this country remains a problem that can have very serious consequences including increased risk for school dropout, substance use, teenage pregnancy, and criminal activity. Clearly, identification of psychological variables (self-variables) of individuals that facilitate or hinder adolescents' levels of school engagement would contribute greatly to the understanding of how to increase adolescents' psychological well-being and their achievement motivation and associated school engagement. The present study examined the degree of association of three specific self-variables (self-efficacy, goal orientation, and fear of failure) with school engagement for high school students. The results and implications for intervention and future research are addressed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Psychol Schs 40: 417–427, 2003.","authors":["Kirsten Caraway","Carolyn M.
