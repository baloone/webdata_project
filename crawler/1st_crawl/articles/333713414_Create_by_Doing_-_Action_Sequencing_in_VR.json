{"id":"333713414_Create_by_Doing_-_Action_Sequencing_in_VR","abstract":"In every virtual reality application, there are actions to perform, often in a logical order. This logical ordering can be a predefined sequence of actions, enriched with the representation of different possibilities, which we refer to as a scenario. Authoring such a scenario for virtual reality is still a difficult task, as it needs both the expertise from the domain expert and the developer. We propose to let the domain expert create in virtual reality the scenario by herself without coding, through the paradigm of creating by doing. The domain expert can run an application, record the sequence of actions as a scenario, and then reuse this scenario for other purposes, such as an automatic replay of the scenario by a virtual actor to check the obtained scenario, the injection of this scenario as a constraint or a guide for a trainee, or the monitoring of the scenario unfolding during a procedure.","authors":["Flavien Lécuyer","Valérie Gouranton","Adrien Reuzeau","Ronan Gaugne"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-22514-8_27","In book: Advances in Computer Graphics (pp.329-335)","Project: Introspect"],"references":["238219266_Does_this_stuff_work_A_review_of_technology_Used_to_Teach","225401122_Environmental_Detectives-the_development_of_an_augmented_reality_platform_for_environmental_simulations","224169975_A_Virtual_Reality_Dance_Training_System_Using_Motion_Capture_Technology","221607792_Heroes_Villains_Magicians_Dramatis_Personae_in_a_Virtual_Story_Creation_Environment","221221444_Immersive_Authoring_of_Tangible_Augmented_Reality_Applications","221033626_Mystery_at_the_museum_a_collaborative_game_for_museum_education","276950091_The_Use_of_Immersive_Virtual_Reality_in_the_Learning_Sciences_Digital_Transformations_of_Teachers_Students_and_Social_Context","234787177_Virtual_Reality_In_the_Mind_of_the_Beholder"]}
