The mRNA binding protein Imp was identified to play a fundamental role in this process. One of Imp targets, profilin mRNA, encodes for an actin regulator that has been shown to be involved in axon remodelling. In this paper we intend to further understand the role of Imp and the importance of profilin mRNA expression regulation during remodelling. To do so, we propose a stochastic framework to exhaustively compare the adult morphology between wild type (WT), imp knockdown (Imp) and imp knockdown rescued by Profilin (Prof Rescue) neurons. Our framework consists in (i) the selection of the main neuron morphological features, (ii) their stochastic modelling and parameter estimation from data and (iii) a maximum likelihood analysis for each individual neuron to quantitatively assess the similarity or difference between groups. Thanks to this framework we show that imp mutant neurons can be divided in two phenotypical groups with a different aberrancy degree, and that profilin overexpression partially rescues the main axon and branch development thereby it reduces the proportion of neurons with the strongest remodelling phenotype.","authors":["Agustina Razetti","Xavier Descombes","Caroline Medioni","Florence Besse"],"meta":["March 2017Communications in Computer and Information Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54717-6_9","Conference: International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies"],"references":["270658107_Discrete_Stochastic_Model_for_the_Generation_of_Axonal_Trees","255975539_Requirement_of_the_combination_of_mushroom_body_lobe_and_lobes_for_the_retrieval_of_both_aversive_and_appetitive_early_memories_in_Drosophila","228087860_Fiji_An_Open-Source_Platform_for_Biological-Image_Analysis","221967737_Neuromantic_-_from_Semi-Manual_to_Semi-Automatic_Reconstruction_of_Neuron_Morphology","49680423_Comparison_Between_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Classifications_of_Neuronal_Cell_Types_A_Case_Study","15598093_Profilin_mutations_disrupt_multiple_actin-dependent_processes_during_Drosophila_development","13544021_Interstitial_Branches_Develop_from_Active_Regions_of_the_Axon_Demarcated_by_the_Primary_Growth_Cone_during_Pausing_Behaviors","11240348_Actin_Cytoskeleton_Regulation_in_Neuronal_Morphogenesis_and_Structural_Plasticity","268232940_From_Curves_to_Trees_A_Tree-like_Shapes_Distance_Using_the_Elastic_Shape_Analysis_Framework","261032962_Imp_Promotes_Axonal_Remodeling_by_Regulating_profilin_mRNA_during_Brain_Development","259133504_Bayesian_network_modeling_of_the_consensus_between_experts_An_application_to_neuron_classification","224931756_Mushroom_body_neuronal_remodelling_is_necessary_for_short-term_but_not_for_long-term_courtship_memory_in_Drosophila","13820053_Profilins_as_regulators_of_actin_dynamics","7857110_Remodeling_dendrites_during_insect_metamorphosis","7720273_Diversity_of_ganglion_cells_in_the_mouse_retina_Unsupervised_morphological_classification_and_its_limits","6414462_A_protocol_for_mosaic_analysis_with_a_repressible_cell_marker_MARCM_in","5530350_Drosophila_Fragile_X_Mental_Retardation_Protein_Developmentally_Regulates_Activity-Dependent_Axon_Pruning"]}
