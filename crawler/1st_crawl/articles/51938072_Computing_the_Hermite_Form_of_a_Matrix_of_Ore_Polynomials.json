{"id":"51938072_Computing_the_Hermite_Form_of_a_Matrix_of_Ore_Polynomials","abstract":"Let R=F[D;sigma,delta] be the ring of Ore polynomials over a field (or skew\nfield) F, where sigma is a automorphism of F and delta is a sigma-derivation.\nGiven a an m by n matrix A over R, we show how to compute the Hermite form H of\nA and a unimodular matrix U such that UA=H. The algorithm requires a polynomial\nnumber of operations in F in terms of both the dimensions m and n, and the\ndegree of the entries in A. When F=k(z) for some field k, it also requires time\npolynomial in the degree in z, and if k is the rational numbers Q, it requires\ntime polynomial in the bit length of the coefficients as well. Explicit\nanalyses are provided for the complexity, in particular for the important cases\nof differential and shift polynomials over Q(z). To accomplish our algorithm,\nwe apply the Dieudonne determinant and quasideterminant theory for Ore\npolynomial rings to get explicit bounds on the degrees and sizes of entries in\nH and U.","authors":["Mark Giesbrecht","Myung Sub Kim"],"meta":["September 2011Journal of Algebra 376","DOI:10.1016/j.jalgebra.2012.11.033","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258499111_Computer_Algebra_in_Scientific_Computing","251806498_Computing_Popov_Form_of_General_Ore_Polynomial_Matrices","228793059_The_MAPLE_Package_Janet_II_Linear_Partial_Differential_Equations","228576560_A_polynomial-time_algorithm_for_the_Jacobson_form_for_matrices_of_differential_operators","221564403_On_solutions_of_linear_functional_systems","2869739_Algorithms_for_Normal_Forms_for_Matrices_of_Polynomials_and_Ore_Polynomials","2451105_Fast_Parallel_Computation_of_Hermite_and_Smith_Forms_of_Polynomial_Matrices","295214210_On_ore_rings_linear_operators_and_factorization","285732912_Les_dterminants_sur_un_corps_non_commutatif","285335092_Sur_l'introduction_des_variables_continues_dans_la_theorie_des_nombres","268760607_Linear_equations_in_non-commutative_fields","266513044_On_Ore_rings_linear_operators_and_factorization","266011335_Algebras_and_Their_Arithmetics","265564734_Determinants_of_matrices_over_noncommutative_rings","265333427_Theory_of_noncommutative_determinants_and_characteristic_functions_of_graphs","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","256555053_Solving_systems_of_linear_equations_over_polynomials","247679245_Sur_les_fonctions_de_sept_lettres","243109156_Non-commutative_domains_of_integrity","242619135_Theory_of_Non-Commutative_Polynomials","242530041_Linear_operators_and_factorisation","242515766_On_systems_of_indeterminate_equations_and_congruences","241414794_On_Systems_of_Linear_Indeterminate_Equations_and_Congruences","239064300_Invariant_Description_of_Linear_Time-Invariant_Controllable_Systems","238738620_Computation_of_hermite_and_smith_normal_forms_of_matrices","238691392_Polynomial-time_algorithms_for_solving_systems_of_linear_equations_over_polynomials","236678182_A_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_the_Jacobson_Form_of_a_Matrix_of_Ore_Polynomials","234812500_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Verification_of_Polynomial_Identities","228695535_Formes_de_Hermite_et_de_Jacobson_Implementations_et_applications","225914451_OreModules_A_Symbolic_Package_for_the_Study_of_Multidimensional_Linear_Systems","225193916_Exact_solution_of_linear_equations_usingP-adic_expansions","223208984_An_algebraic_framework_generalizing_the_concept_of_transfer_functions_to_nonlinear_systems","222845255_An_introduction_to_pseudo-linear_algebra","222674823_Fraction-free_row_reduction_of_matrices_of_Ore_polynomials","222547758_Fast_computation_of_Hermite_normal_forms_of_random_integer_matrices","222445142_Generalized_Subresultants_for_Computing_the_Smith_Normal_Form_of_Polynomial_Matrices","222420491_Quasideterminants","222294946_On_lattice_reduction_for_polynomial_matrices","221144200_Non-Commutative_Determinants_in_Nonlinear_Control_Theory_Preliminary_Ideas","220617109_Nearly_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Canonical_Matrix_Forms","220161239_Computing_diagonal_form_and_Jacobson_normal_form_of_a_matrix_using_Grobner_bases","220160703_High-order_lifting_and_integrality_certification","45858253_On_Computing_the_Hermite_Form_of_a_Matrix_of_Differential_Polynomials","31135935_An_algebraic_analysis_approach_to_linear_time-varying_systems","2941232_OreModules_A_symbolic_package_for_the_study_of_multidimensional_linear_systems","2904316_Effective_Algorithms_for_Parametrizing_Linear_Control_Systems_over_Ore_Algebras","2505433_On_Fast_Multiplication_of_Polynomials_Over_Arbitrary_Algebras"]}
