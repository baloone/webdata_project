{"id":"310592720_A_Census_of_Statistics_Requirements_at_US_Journalism_Programs_and_a_Model_for_a_Statistics_for_Journalism_Course_Journalism_Mass_Communication_Educator","abstract":"This article presents data from a census of statistics requirements and offerings at all 4-year journalism programs in the United States (N = 369) and proposes a model of a potential course in statistics for journalism majors. The author proposes that three philosophies underlie a statistics course for journalism students. Such a course should (a) represent a statistics course with journalism, not a journalism course seasoned with a few statistics; (b) encourage awareness of error and skepticism of omniscience of official figures; and (c) cultivate statistical enthusiasts, not formulae repositories. Findings report students in just one fifth of U.S. journalism programs are required to take statistics, and none of those programs offer a course within their own academic unit that fulfills a traditional statistics requirement.","authors":["Justin Martin"],"meta":["November 2016Journalism & Mass Communication Educator 72(4):461-479","DOI:10.1177/1077695816679054","Project: Data about Journalism, Data in Journalism"],"references":["349861219_Working_With_Numbers_and_Statistics_A_Handbook_for_Journalists","344568756_The_Blind_Spot_Science_and_the_Crisis_of_Uncertainty","324369094_How_to_Lie_with_Statistics","303619010_Stabbing_News_Articulating_Crime_Statistics_in_the_Newsroom","303174361_Reliability_of_content_analysis_The_case_of_nominal_scale_coding","301905109_Quantitatively_Oriented_Forms_of_Journalism_and_Their_Epistemology","292265205_Stat-spotting_A_field_guide_to_identifying_dubious_data","290566639_55_Years_of_Harvard_Statistics_Stories_Snapshots_and_Statistics","286362106_Expert_Political_Judgment_How_Good_is_It_How_can_We_Know","286200443_Naked_Statistics_Stripping_the_Dread_from_Data"]}
