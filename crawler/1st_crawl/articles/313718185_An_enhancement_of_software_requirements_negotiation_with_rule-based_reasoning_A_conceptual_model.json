Stakeholders are people related to the system and usually come to the elicitation process with different perception and perspective. Dealing with multiple stakeholders, conflicts are inevitable and therefore the need of negotiation mechanism to resolve conflict is crucial. This paper forwards an enhancement of software requirements negotiation conceptual model to assist the conflict detection and resolution effort.
