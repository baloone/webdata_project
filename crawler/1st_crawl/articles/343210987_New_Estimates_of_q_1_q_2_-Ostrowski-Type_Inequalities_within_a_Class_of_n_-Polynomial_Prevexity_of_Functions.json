{"id":"343210987_New_Estimates_of_q_1_q_2_-Ostrowski-Type_Inequalities_within_a_Class_of_n_-Polynomial_Prevexity_of_Functions","abstract":"In this article, we develop a novel framework to study for a new class of preinvex functions depending on arbitrary nonnegative function, which is called n-polynomial preinvex functions. We use the n-polynomial preinvex functions to develop q1q2-analogues of the Ostrowski-type integral inequalities on coordinates. Different features and properties of excitement for quantum calculus have been examined through a systematic way. We are discussing about the suggestions and different results of the quantum inequalities of the Ostrowski-type by inferring a new identity for q1q2-differentiable function. However, the problem has been proven to utilize the obtained identity, we give q1q2-analogues of the Ostrowski-type integrals inequalities which are connected with the n-polynomial preinvex functions on coordinates. Our results are the generalizations of the results in earlier papers.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Muhammad Idrees","Dumitru Baleanu","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Function Spaces 2020(1):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2020/3720798","Project: Quantum Integral Inequalities"],"references":["345349487_Sharp_Power_Mean_Inequalities_for_the_Generalized_Elliptic_Integral_of_the_First_Kind","342063402_New_estimates_considering_the_generalized_proportional_Hadamard_fractional_integral_operators","341887157_Generation_of_new_fractional_inequalities_via_n_polynomials_s-type_convexity_with_applications","341677340_2D_approximately_reciprocal_r-convex_functions_and_associated_integral_inequalities","341164371_New_Hermite-Hadamard_type_inequalities_for_n-polynomial_harmonically_convex_functions","340960108_A_Note_on_Reverse_Minkowski_Inequality_via_Generalized_Proportional_Fractional_Integral_Operator_with_respect_to_Another_Function","340867301_Answers_to_three_conjectures_on_convexity_of_three_functions_involving_complete_elliptic_integrals_of_the_first_kind","342102117_Conformable_fractional_integral_inequalities_for_GG-_and_GA-convex_functions","341934146_Refinements_of_Jensen's_and_McShane's_inequalities_with_applications","341542872_A_sharp_double_inequality_involving_generalized_complete_elliptic_integral_of_the_first_kind"]}
