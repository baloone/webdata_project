{"id":"258520869_Deterministic_Primality_Testing_-_understanding_the_AKS_algorithm","abstract":"Prime numbers play a very vital role in modern cryptography and especially\nthe difficulties involved in factoring numbers composed of product of two large\nprime numbers have been put to use in many modern cryptographic designs. Thus,\nthe problem of distinguishing prime numbers from the rest is vital and\ntherefore there is a need to have efficient primality testing algorithms.\nAlthough there had been many probabilistic algorithms for primality testing,\nthere wasn't a deterministic polynomial time algorithm until 2002 when Agrawal,\nKayal and Saxena came with an algorithm, popularly known as the AKS algorithm,\nwhich could test whether a given number is prime or composite in polynomial\ntime. This project is an attempt at understanding the ingenious idea behind\nthis algorithm and the underlying principles of mathematics that is required to\nstudy it. In fact, through out this project, one of the major objectives has\nbeen to make it as much self contained as possible. Finally, the project\nprovides an implementation of the algorithm using Software for Algebra and\nGeometry Experimentation (SAGE) and arrives at conclusions on how practical or\notherwise it is.","authors":["Vijay Menon"],"meta":["November 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270066303_Introduction_to_Finite_Fields_and_Their_Applications","266938803_A_Computational_Introduction_to_Number_Theory_and_Algebra","242354643_Introduction_to_finite_fields_and_their_applications_rev_ed","220694260_An_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Numbers","220577338_A_computational_introduction_to_number_theory_and_algebra"]}
