{"id":"326141095_Affective_Representations_for_Sarcasm_Detection","abstract":"Sarcasm detection from text has gained increasing attention. While one thread of research has emphasized the importance of affective content in sarcasm detection, another avenue of research has explored the effectiveness of word representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for automated sarcasm detection in text, called Affective Word Embeddings for Sarcasm (AWES), which incorporates affective information into word representations. Extensive evaluation on sarcasm detection on six datasets across three domains of text (tweets, reviews and forum posts) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that while sentiment affective representations yield best results on datasets comprising of short length text such as tweets, richer representations derived from fine-grained emotions are more suitable for detecting sarcasm from longer length documents such as product reviews and discussion forum posts.","authors":["Ameeta Agrawal","Aijun An"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1145/3209978.3210148","Conference: The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference"],"references":["319349800_Really_Well_Apparently_Bootstrapping_Improves_the_Performance_of_Sarcasm_and_Nastiness_Classifiers_for_Online_Dialogue","312250769_Creating_and_Characterizing_a_Diverse_Corpus_of_Sarcasm_in_Dialogue","305767979_Are_Word_Embedding-based_Features_Useful_for_Sarcasm_Detection","303360388_The_perfect_solution_for_detecting_sarcasm_in_tweets_not","284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","281492671_Sarcastic_or_Not_Word_Embeddings_to_Predict_the_Literal_or_Sarcastic_Meaning_of_Words","280997312_Harnessing_Context_Incongruity_for_Sarcasm_Detection","278734421_Image-Based_Recommendations_on_Styles_and_Substitutes","265609862_When_language_gets_emotional_Irony_and_the_embodiment_of_affect_in_discourse","263661940_Modelling_Sarcasm_in_Twitter_a_Novel_Approach","258247973_Identifying_Purpose_Behind_Electoral_Tweets","256199465_Crowdsourcing_a_Word-Emotion_Association_Lexicon","254746105_WordNet-Affect_an_Affective_Extension_of_WordNet","241726959_Are_There_Necessary_Conditions_for_Inducing_a_Sense_of_Sarcastic_Irony","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","220874376_Identifying_Sarcasm_in_Twitter_A_Closer_Look","322582488_Using_millions_of_emoji_occurrences_to_learn_any-domain_representations_for_detecting_sentiment_emotion_and_sarcasm","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","309150566_Distinguishing_between_irony_and_sarcasm_in_social_media_texts_Linguistic_observations","308979132_When_language_gets_emotional_Irony_and_the_embodiment_of_affect_in_discourse","305216699_Irony_Detection_in_Twitter_The_Role_of_Affective_Content","303360625_Sarcasm_as_contrast_between_a_positive_sentiment_and_negative_situation","303358623_Figurative_Messages_and_Affect_in_Twitter_Differences_Between_irony_sarcasm_and_not","270877509_Learning_Sentiment-Specific_Word_Embedding_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification","267265686_Irony_and_Sarcasm_Corpus_Generation_and_Analysis_Using_Crowdsourcing","257026048_From_humor_recognition_to_irony_detection_The_figurative_language_of_social_media","255173850_Generating_Sequences_With_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","228942442_Semi-supervised_recognition_of_sarcastic_sentences_in_twitter_and_Amazon","221298009_ICWSM_-_A_Great_Catchy_Name_Semi-Supervised_Recognition_of_Sarcastic_Sentences_in_Online_Product_Reviews"]}
