{"id":"317305313_Sub_implicative_ideals_of_KU-Algebras","abstract":"It is an important way to research the algebras by its ideals. In BCI-algebra the notion of sub-implicative, positive implicative and sub-commutative, p- ideals are introduced . There is a close relation among above mentioned ideals. That is in a BCI-algebra X, a nonempty subset of X is a sub-implicative ideal if and only if it is both a sub-commutative ideal and positive implicative ideal. In this paper, we establishe the notions of ku- sub implicative/ ku-positive/ ku- sub-commutative and kp- ideals in KU-algebras and investigate some of their properties. Also, the relationships with ku -sub implicative ideals and ku- sub-commutative/ ku-positive implicative are given. In a KU-algebra X, a nonempty subset of X is a ku- sub-implicative ideal if and only if it is both a sub-commutative and positive implicative ideals is proved . \nAny kp-ideal is always ku- sub-implicative and ku-sub-commutative ideals is investigated ,but the converse is not true. Moreover We prove that any ku- sub implicative (ku- sub-commutative) ideal is an ideal, but the converse is not true. Also other properties about ku- sub-commutative ideals of KU-algebras are given.","authors":["Samy Mostafa"],"meta":["June 2017"],"references":["285596447_TOPOLOGY_SPECTRUM_OF_A_KU-ALGEBRA","266050551_Fuzzy_Ideals_of_KU_-Algebras","286685841_An_ideal_characterization_of_commutative_BCI-algebras","283968626_On_BCI-algebras","268495273_Commutative_BCI-algebras","266524078_On_ideals_in_BCK-algebras","265373438_Positive_implicative_BCI-algebras","265354706_An_introduction_to_theory_of_BCK-algebras","220310764_BCI-implicative_ideals_of_BCI-algebras"]}
