{"id":"260787464_Modeling_Reality_-_How_Computers_Mirror_Life","abstract":"Modeling Reality covers a wide range of fascinating subjects,\naccessible to anyone who wants to learn about the use of computer\nmodeling to solve a diverse range of problems, but who does not possess\na specialized training in mathematics or computer science. The material\npresented is pitched at the level of high-school graduates, even though\nit covers some advanced topics (cellular automata, Shannon's measure of\ninformation, deterministic chaos, fractals, game theory, neural\nnetworks, genetic algorithms, and Turing machines). These advanced\ntopics are explained in terms of well known simple concepts: Cellular\nautomata - Game of Life, Shannon's formula - Game of twenty questions,\nGame theory - Television quiz, etc. The book is unique in explaining in\na straightforward, yet complete, fashion many important ideas, related\nto various models of reality and their applications. Twenty-five\nprograms, written especially for this book, are provided on an\naccompanying CD. They greatly enhance its pedagogical value and make\nlearning of even the more complex topics an enjoyable pleasure.","authors":["Iwo Bialynicki-Birula","Iwona Bialynicka-Birula"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198531005.001.0001","Publisher: Oxford University Press"],"references":["234829355_Scientific_and_Engineering_Problem-Solving_with_the_Computer"]}
