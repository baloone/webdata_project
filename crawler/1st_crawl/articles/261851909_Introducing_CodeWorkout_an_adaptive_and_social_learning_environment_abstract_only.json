{"id":"261851909_Introducing_CodeWorkout_an_adaptive_and_social_learning_environment_abstract_only","abstract":"Rudimentary programming skills are essential to developing fundamental proficiency in computer science. However, learning programming techniques can be challenging and frustrating for many students. CodeWorkout is an online learning environment that offers drill-and-practice exercises with novel social and adaptive scaffolding. Learners can track their progress on an assortment of computer science areas and skills while taking advantage of social features to discuss questions and help teach each other. Meanwhile, objective measurements of questions and teaching hints help promote the best, most effective content for learning. Our poster demonstrates how both computer science students and teachers benefit from joining the CodeWorkout community and taking advantage of its unique features.","authors":["Kevin Buffardi","Stephen H.
