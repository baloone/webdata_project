{"id":"221299149_Text_genre_classification_with_genre-revealing_and_subject-revealing_features","abstract":"Subject or prepositional content has been the focus of most classification research. Genre or style, on the other hand, is a different and important property of text, and automatic text genre classification is becoming important for classification and retrieval purposes as well as for some natural language processing research. In this paper, we present a method for automatic genre classification that is based on statistically selected features obtained from both subject-classified and genre classified training data. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a direct application of a statistical learner often used for subject classification. We also observe that the deviation formula and discrimination formula using document frequency ratios also work as expected. We conjecture that this dual feature set approach can be generalized to improve the performance of subject classification as well.","authors":["Yong-Bae Lee","Sung-Hyon Myaeng"],"meta":["January 2002","DOI:10.1145/564376.564403","SourceDBLP","Conference: SIGIR 2002: Proceedings of the 25th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, August 11-15, 2002, Tampere, Finland"],"references":["221300693_A_Practical_Hypertext_Categorization_Method_Using_Links_and_Incrementally_Available_Class_Information","2806517_Stylistic_Variation_in_an_Information_Retrieval_Experiment","2805947_Web-Specific_Genre_Visualization","2771377_Recognizing_Text_Genres_with_Simple_Metrics_Using_Discriminant_Analysis","2563912_Genres_and_the_WEB_Is_the_personal_home_page_the_first_uniquely_digital_genre","2313955_Iterative_Information_Retrieval_Using_Fast_Clustering_and_Usage-Specific_Genres","292052938_A_comparison_of_two_learning_algorithms_for_text_categorization","245507577_Assembling_a_Balanced_Corpus_from_the_Internet","221102601_Text_Genre_Detection_Using_Common_Word_Frequencies","2552792_A_Re-Examination_of_Text_Categorization_Methods"]}
