{"id":"288066914_Relationships_Among_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_and_Desirability_of_Learning_Computing_Skills","abstract":"Attitudes toward computers, computer self-efficacy, and commitment of learning computing skills have been recognized as important factors to assist college students in acquiring computer technologies. However, little research has been done on the combination of these factors. This study investigated the relationships among computer self-efficacy, attitudes toward computers, and desirability of learning computing skills. Three hypotheses were tested using the Attitudes Toward Computer Technologies (Delcourt & Kinzie, 1993) and Confidence and Desired Knowledge with Computer Technologies (Murphy, Coover, & Owen, 1989) measures. Statistical analyses consisted of bivariate correlations and simultaneous multiple regression. The findings included that comfort or anxiety about computers perceived by students predicted their confidence levels about computers. Studentsâ€™ self-recognition of usefulness of computers and their perception of advanced levels of computer technologies were significant predictors in deciding their desirability of learning computing skills.","authors":["Yixin Zhang","Sue Espinoza"],"meta":["June 1998Journal of Research on Computing in Education 30(4):420-436","DOI:10.1080/08886504.1998.10782236"],"references":["247727650_Development_and_Validity_of_the_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Scale","236135021_Predicting_Student_Teacher_Commitment_to_the_Use_of_Computers","235675902_An_Exploration_of_Theoretical_and_Practical_Foundations_for_Assessing_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_The_Computer_Attitude_Measure_CAM","233146373_Self-Efficacy_Expectations_as_a_Predictor_of_Computer_Use","232602857_Role_of_Efficacy_Expectations_in_Predicting_the_Decision_to_Use_Advanced_Technologies_The_Case_of_Computers","227955361_Self-assessed_training_needs_The_effects_of_attitudes_toward_training_managerial_level_and_function","225481312_Computer_Technologies_attitudes_and_Self-Efficacy_across_Undergraduate_Disciplines","225417506_Enhancing_self-efficacy_for_computer_technologies_through_the_use_of_positive_classroom_experience","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","286016354_Self-efficacy_expectations_as_a_predictor_of_computer_use_A_look_at_early_childhood_administrators","284686594_University_Students'_Computer_Knowledge_and_Commitment_to_Learning","271729775_Predictors_of_Study_Management_and_Performance_on_A_First-Year_Computer_Course_The_Significance_of_Students'_Study_Goals_and_Perceptions","250144652_A_Comparison_of_Four_Computer_Attitude_Scales","246876214_Self-Efficacy_and_Classroom_Learning","234744434_A_Survey_of_Age_and_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","234744327_Events_and_Practices_That_Promote_Attitudes_and_Emotions_in_Computing_Courses","232454868_Modeling_and_attributional_effects_on_children's_achievement_A_self-efficacy_analysis","230557429_Self-Efficacy_Mechanism_in_Human_Agency","227784973_Knowledge_Commitment_and_Attitudes_of_Home_Economics_Faculty_Toward_Computers","227100145_The_Relationship_of_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Expectations_to_Computer_Interest_and_Course_Enrollment_in_College","225834607_Analysis_of_self-efficacy_theory_of_behavior_change","225269894_Coefficient_Alpha_and_Internal_Structure_of_Tests","224277161_Learning_needs_and_attitudes_of_nursing_educators_with_respect_to_computers","223219132_Cultural_socialization_to_computing_in_college","222036202_The_application_of_human_factors_to_the_needs_of_the_novice_computer_user"]}
