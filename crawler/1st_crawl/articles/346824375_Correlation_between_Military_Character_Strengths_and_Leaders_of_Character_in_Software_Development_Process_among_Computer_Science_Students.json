{"id":"346824375_Correlation_between_Military_Character_Strengths_and_Leaders_of_Character_in_Software_Development_Process_among_Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"The National Defence University of Malaysia (NDUM) is the sole provider of tertiary education for future military personnel. As a boutique university, NDUM emphasises on developing military character strengths among its students in all aspects of co-curricular and academic curriculum. This paper will present the relationship between Military Character Strengths (MCS) and the software development process (SDP), as part of the Final Year Project (FYP) for Computer Science students at the Faculty of Defence Science and Technology. This study has analysed the formation of an outstanding and successful NDUM student, which can be influenced by the MCS. NDUM has outlined the characteristics of its ideal graduates, known as the 'Leaders of Character' (LoC). The results showed that MCS are important attributes of LoC implementation. The results further showed that there was a correlation between MCS and LoC in software development process for Computer Science students in NDUM.","authors":["Suzaimah Ramli","Muslihah Wook","Aminulhaq Ghazali","Roziyah Ahmad"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Information and Education Technology 10(10):763-767","DOI:10.18178/ijiet.2020.10.10.1455"],"references":["277971329_Understanding_Military_Pedagogy","262883933_The_Priming_Effect_of_Military_Service_on_Creativity_Performance","261846036_Selection_of_appropriate_software_development_life_cycle_using_fuzzy_logic","258046807_Partial_Least_Squares_Structural_Equation_Modeling_PLS-SEM_An_Emerging_Tool_for_Business_Research","229892421_The_Use_of_Partial_Least_Squares_Path_Modeling_in_International_Marketing","345435447_NL_ARMS_Netherlands_Annual_Review_of_Military_Studies_2019_Educating_Officers_The_Thinking_Soldier_-_The_NLDA_and_the_Bologna_Declaration_Educating_Officers_The_Thinking_Soldier_-_The_NLDA_and_the_Bol","319577141_A_Software_System_Development_Life_Cycle_Model_for_Improved_Students_Communication_and_Collaboration","301347385_On_military_creativity","249007860_Magnanimity_and_Integrity_as_Military_Virtues","247503750_Military_Team_Research_10_Years_of_Progress","222575319_Military_Leadership_A_Context_Specific_Review"]}
