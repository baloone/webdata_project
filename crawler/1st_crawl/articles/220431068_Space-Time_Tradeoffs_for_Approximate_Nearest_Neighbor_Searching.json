{"id":"220431068_Space-Time_Tradeoffs_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Searching","abstract":"Nearest neighbor searching is the problem of preprocessing a set of n point points in d -dimensional space so that, given any query point q , it is possible to report the closest point to q rapidly. In approximate nearest neighbor searching, a parameter ε > 0 is given, and a multiplicative error of (1 + ε) is allowed. We assume that the dimension d is a constant and treat n and ε as asymptotic quantities. Numerous solutions have been proposed, ranging from low-space solutions having space O ( n ) and query time O (log n + 1/ε d −1 ) to high-space solutions having space roughly O (( n log n )/ε d ) and query time O (log ( n /ε)).\nWe show that there is a single approach to this fundamental problem, which both improves upon existing results and spans the spectrum of space-time tradeoffs. Given a tradeoff parameter γ, where 2 ≤ γ ≤ 1/ε, we show that there exists a data structure of space O ( n γ d −1 log(1/ε)) that can answer queries in time O (log( n γ) + 1/(εγ) ( d −1)/2 . When γ = 2, this yields a data structure of space O ( n log (1/ε)) that can answer queries in time O (log n + 1/ε ( d −1)/2 ). When γ = 1/ε, it provides a data structure of space O (( n /ε d −1 )log(1/ε)) that can answer queries in time O (log( n /ε)).\nOur results are based on a data structure called a ( t ,ε)-AVD, which is a hierarchical quadtree-based subdivision of space into cells. Each cell stores up to t representative points of the set, such that for any query point q in the cell at least one of these points is an approximate nearest neighbor of q . We provide new algorithms for constructing AVDs and tools for analyzing their total space requirements. We also establish lower bounds on the space complexity of AVDs, and show that, up to a factor of O (log (1/ε)), our space bounds are asymptotically tight in the two extremes, γ = 2 and γ = 1/ε.","authors":["Sunil Arya","Theocharis Malamatos","David Mount"],"meta":["November 2009Journal of the ACM 57(1)","DOI:10.1145/1613676.1613677","SourceDBLP"],"references":["277285286_Approximate_Range_Searching_In_The_Absolute_Error_Model","227083881_Approximate_Range_Searching_The_Absolute_Model","220431294_A_Decomposition_of_Multidimensional_Point_Sets_with_Applications_to_k-Nearest-Neighbors_and_n-Body_Potential_Fields","3297722_The_Concentration_of_Fractional_Distances","2845566_When_Is_Nearest_Neighbor_Meaningful","2552762_Finding_Nearest_Neighbors_in_Growth-restricted_Metrics","1958591_Entropy_based_Nearest_Neighbor_Search_in_High_Dimensions","1957458_Fast_Construction_of_Nets_in_Low_Dimensional_Metrics_and_Their_Applications","286517161_Skip_quadtrees_Dynamic_data_structures_for_multidimensional_point_sets","242607518_The_approximation_of_convex_sets_by_polyhedra","227183719_The_Effect_of_Corners_on_the_Complexity_of_Approximate_Range_Searching","225453164_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Queries_Revisited","225428142_Nearest_Neighbor_Queries_in_Metric_Spaces","223470908_Nearest_Neighbors_Search_Using_Point_Location_in_Balls_with_Applications_to_Approximate_Voronoi_Decompositions","222839576_Approximate_range_searching","222729954_Metric_Entropy_of_Some_Classes_of_Sets_with_Differentiable_Boundaries","222534394_Balanced_Aspect_Ratio_Trees_Combining_the_Advantages_of_k-d_Trees_and_Octrees","221471774_Hierarchical_Spatial_Data_Structures","221337860_Tradeoffs_in_Approximate_Range_Searching_Made_Simpler","220991597_Dynamic_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Neighbor_Searching","220983319_An_Algorithm_for_Approximate_Closest-Point_Queries","220779242_Navigating_nets_Simple_algorithms_for_proximity_search","220770097_Space-Time_Tradeoffs_for_Proximity_Searching_in_Doubling_Spaces","220694042_Matrix_Computations_3rd_ed","220618437_Biased_Search_Trees","220617999_On_Constructing_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_in_k_-Dimensional_Spaces_and_Related_Problems","220430768_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Searching_Fixed_Dimensions","220407020_A_Data_Structure_for_Dynamically_Maintaining_Rooted_Trees","220268441_Searching_dynamic_point_sets_in_spaces_with_bounded_doubling_dimension","47841983_On_the_Importance_of_Idempotence","47841906_Space-Time_Tradeoffs_for_Approximate_Spherical_Range_Counting","30874038_Computational_Geometry_An_Introduction","3921147_A_replacement_for_Voronoi_diagrams_of_near_linear_size","2937440_The_Black-Box_Complexity_of_Nearest_Neighbor_Search","2914276_A_Replacement_for_Voronoi_Diagrams_of_Near_Linear_Size","2866566_Space-Efficient_Approximate_Voronoi_Diagrams","2846138_Linear-Size_Approximate_Voronoi_Diagrams","2652869_Approximating_Generalized_Voronoi_Diagrams_in_Any_Dimension","2320094_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_Towards_Removing_the_Curse_of_Dimensionality","1958334_The_Skip_Quadtree_A_Simple_Dynamic_Data_Structure_for_Multidimensional_Data"]}
