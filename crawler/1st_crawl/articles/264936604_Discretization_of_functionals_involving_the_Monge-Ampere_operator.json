{"id":"264936604_Discretization_of_functionals_involving_the_Monge-Ampere_operator","abstract":"Gradient flows in the Wasserstein space have become a powerful tool in the\nanalysis of diffusion equations, following the seminal work of Jordan,\nKinderlehrer and Otto (JKO). The numerical applications of this formulation\nhave been limited by the difficulty to compute the Wasserstein distance in\ndimension >= 2. One step of the JKO scheme is equivalent to a variational\nproblem on the space of convex functions, which involves the Monge-Amp\\`ere\noperator. Convexity constraints are notably difficult to handle numerically,\nbut in our setting the internal energy plays the role of a barrier for these\nconstraints. This enables us to introduce a consistent discretization, which\ninherits convexity properties of the continuous variational problem. We show\nthe effectiveness of our approach on nonlinear diffusion and crowd-motion\nmodels.","authors":["Jean-David Benamou","Guillaume Carlier","Quentin MÃ©rigot","Edouard Oudet"],"meta":["November 2016Numerische Mathematik 134(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00211-015-0781-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257507130_One-Dimensional_Numerical_Algorithms_for_Gradient_Flows_in_the_p-Wasserstein_Spaces","243047285_Non-convergence_result_for_conformal_approximation_of_variational_problems_subject_to_a_convexity_constraint","242943860_On_the_numerical_solution_of_the_equation_fracpartial_2_zpartial_x2_fracpartial_2_zpartial_y2_-_left_fracpartial_2_zpartial_xpartial_y_right2_f_and_its_discretizations_I","266213841_Wide_stencil_finite_difference_schemes_for_the_elliptic_Monge-Ampere_equation_and_functions_of_the_eigenvalues_of_the_Hessian","260680319_Handling_Convexity-Like_Constraints_in_Variational_Problems","260107661_Adaptive_Anisotropic_and_Hierarchical_cones_of_Discrete_Convex_functions","246337770_Gradient_Flows_in_Metric_Spaces_and_in_the_Space_of_Probability_Measures","245023007_The_Monge-Ampere_Equation","242570070_Convex_bodies_the_Brunn-Minkowski_theory","233290569_Strong_convergence_results_related_to_strict_convexity","228083365_Optimal_Transport_and_Cournot-Nash_Equilibria","227158687_A_numerical_approach_to_variational_problems_subject_to_convexity_constraint","225384603_An_algorithm_for_computing_solutions_of_variational_problems_with_global_convexity_constraints","229754571_Boundary_Regularity_of_Maps_with_Convex_Potentials--II","227632352_Polar_Factorization_and_Monotone_Rearrangement_of_Vector-Valued_Functions"]}
