{"id":"299364542_Developing_computational_thinking_in_the_classroom_a_framework","abstract":"Computational thinking sits at the heart of the new statutory programme of study for Computing: “A high quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world” (Department for Education, 2013, p. 188). This document aims to support teachers to teach computational thinking. It describes a framework that helps explain what computational thinking is, describes pedagogic approaches for teaching it and gives ways to assess it. Pupil progression with the previous ICT curriculum was often demonstrated through ‘how’ (for example, a software usage skill) or ‘what’ the pupil produced (for example, a poster). This was partly due to the needs of the business world for office skills. Such use of precious curriculum time however has several weaknesses. Firstly, the country’s economy depends on technological innovation not just on use of technology. Secondly, the pace of technology and organisational change is fast in that the ICT skills learnt are out of date before a pupil leaves school. Thirdly, technology invades all aspects of our life and the typically taught office practice is only a small part of technology use today.","authors":["Paul Curzon","Mark Dorling","Thomas Ng","Cynthia Selby"],"meta":["June 2014","Project: Comluting at School (CAS)"],"references":["299450690_Computational_thinking_the_developing_definition","220420371_Computational_thinking","299364601_Evidence_of_assessing_computational_thinking"]}
