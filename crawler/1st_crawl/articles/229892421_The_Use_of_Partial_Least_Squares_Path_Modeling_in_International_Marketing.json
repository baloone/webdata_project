{"id":"229892421_The_Use_of_Partial_Least_Squares_Path_Modeling_in_International_Marketing","abstract":"Purpose: This paper discusses partial least squares path modeling (PLS), a powerful structural equation modeling technique for research on international marketing. While a significant body of research provides guidance for the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM) in international marketing, there are no subject-specific guidelines for the use of PLS so far. / Methodology/approach: A literature review of the use of PLS in international marketing reveals the increasing application of this methodology. / Findings: This paper reveals the strengths and weaknesses of PLS in the context of research on international marketing, and provides guidance for multi-group analysis. / Originality/value of paper: The paper assists researchers in making well-grounded decisions regarding the application of PLS in certain research situations and provides specific implications for an appropriate application of the methodology.","authors":["JÃ¶rg Henseler","Christian M.
