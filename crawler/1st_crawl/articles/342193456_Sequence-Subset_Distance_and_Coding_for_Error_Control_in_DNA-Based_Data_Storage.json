{"id":"342193456_Sequence-Subset_Distance_and_Coding_for_Error_Control_in_DNA-Based_Data_Storage","abstract":"The process of DNA-based data storage (DNA storage for short) can be mathematically modelled as a communication channel, termed DNA storage channel, whose inputs and outputs are sets of unordered sequences. To design error correcting codes for DNA storage channel, a new metric, termed the \nsequence-subset distance \n, is introduced, which generalizes the Hamming distance to a distance function defined between any two sets of unordered vectors and helps to establish a uniform framework to design error correcting codes for DNA storage channel. We further introduce a family of error correcting codes, referred to as \nsequence-subset codes \n, for DNA storage and show that the error-correcting ability of such codes is completely determined by their minimum distance. We derive some upper bounds on the size of the sequence-subset codes including a tight bound for a special case, a Singleton-like bound and a Plotkin-like bound. We also propose some constructions, including an optimal construction for that special case, which imply lower bounds on the size of such codes.","authors":["Wentu Song","Kui Cai","Kees Schouhamer Immink"],"meta":["October 2020IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 66(10):6048-6065","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2020.3002611"],"references":["327167068_Codes_with_Run-Length_and_GC-Content_Constraints_for_DNA-based_Data_Storage","323271462_Random_access_in_large-scale_DNA_data_storage","321096828_Design_of_Capacity-Approaching_Constrained_Codes_for_DNA-based_Storage_Systems","317379524_Codes_in_the_Space_of_Multisets-Coding_for_Permutation_Channels_With_Impairments","276211156_A_Rewritable_Random-Access_DNA-Based_Storage_System","235375794_Towards_practical_high-capacity_low-maintenance_information_storage_in_synthesized_DNA","230698422_Next-Generation_Digital_Information_Storage_in_DNA","328112234_On_Coding_Over_Sliced_Information","327088524_Coding_over_Sets_for_DNA_Storage","321506814_Extremal_Combinatorics","320388214_Coding_for_the_l-Limited_Permutation_Channel","316955287_Fundamental_Limits_of_DNA_Storage_Systems","314195927_DNA_Fountain_enables_a_robust_and_efficient_storage_architecture","303905278_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","303746023_Forward_Error_Correction_for_DNA_Data_Storage","272029638_Robust_Chemical_Preservation_of_Digital_Information_on_DNA_in_Silica_with_Error-Correcting_Codes","271771342_Codes_for_DNA_Sequence_Profiles","265426020_Algorithms_for_the_Assignment_and_Transportation_Problems","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","3489306_A_New_Upper_Bound_for_Error-Correcting_Codes","3489165_Binary_Codes_with_Specified_Minimum_Distance","3080270_Efficient_reconstruction_of_sequences"]}
