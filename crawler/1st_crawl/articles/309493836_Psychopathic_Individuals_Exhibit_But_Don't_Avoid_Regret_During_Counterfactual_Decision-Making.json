{"id":"309493836_Psychopathic_Individuals_Exhibit_But_Don't_Avoid_Regret_During_Counterfactual_Decision-Making","abstract":"Psychopathy is associated with persistent antisocial behavior and a striking lack of regret for the consequences of that behavior. Although explanatory models for psychopathy have largely focused on deficits in affective responsiveness, recent work indicates that aberrant value-based decision making may also play a role. On that\nbasis, some have suggested that psychopathic individuals may be unable to effectively use prospective simulations to update action value estimates during costâ€“benefit decision making. However, the specific mechanisms linking valuation, affective deficits, and maladaptive decision making in psychopathy remain unclear. Using a counterfactual decision-making paradigm, we found that individuals who scored high on a measure of psychopathy were as or more likely than individuals low on psychopathy to report negative affect in response to regret-inducing counterfactual outcomes. However, despite exhibiting intact affective regret sensitivity, they did not use prospective regret signals to guide choice behavior. In turn, diminished behavioral regret sensitivity predicted a higher number of prior incarcerations, and moderated the relationship between psychopathy and incarceration history. These findings raise the possibility that maladaptive decision making in psychopathic individuals\nis not a consequence of their inability to generate or experience negative emotions. Rather, antisocial behavior in psychopathy may be driven by a deficit in the generation of forward models that integrate information about rules, costs, and goals with stimulus value representations to promote adaptive behavior.","authors":["Arielle Baskin-Sommers","Allison M Stuppy-Sullivan","Joshua Buckholtz"],"meta":["November 2016Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
