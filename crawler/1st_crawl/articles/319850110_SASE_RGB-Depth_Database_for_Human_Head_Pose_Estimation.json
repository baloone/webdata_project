{"id":"319850110_SASE_RGB-Depth_Database_for_Human_Head_Pose_Estimation","abstract":"Head pose estimation has become very important in relation to facial and emotional recognition, as well as in human-computer interaction. There is an ultimate need for a 3D head pose database in order to develop head pose estimation methods using RGB and depth information. There are a few available datasets, such as Biwi Kinect head pose database, which is composed using Kinect 1, but it offers low-quality depth information. In this paper, a new 3D head database, SASE, is introduced. The data in SASE is acquired with Microsoft Kinect 2 camera, including RGB and depth information. The SASE database is composed by a total of 30000 frames with annotated markers. The samples include 32 male and 18 female subjects. For each person a large sample of head poses are included, within the bounds of yaw from \\(-45\\) to 45, pitch \\(-75\\) to 75 and roll \\(-45\\) to \\(45^\\circ \\) of rotation around each axis. The details of acquiring the database and its characteristics are explained in detail.","authors":["Iiris LÃ¼si","Sergio Escalera","Gholamreza Anbarjafari"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_26","Project: Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction using Multimodal Emotion Recognition based on Gesture, Face, and Speech"],"references":["308806443_Estimation_of_eye_gaze_direction_angles_based_on_active_appearance_models","305108995_3D_with_Kinect","312471343_Facewarehouse_A_3d_facial_expression_database_for_visual_computing","305218338_Real-time_Facial_Animation_with_Image-based_Dynamic_Avatars","304255905_Automatic_model_matching_using_part_based_model_constrained_active_appearance_models_for_skeletal_maturity","302728987_Avatar_eye_control_in_a_multi-user_animation_environment","297897856_Shape-Appearance-Correlated_Active_Appearance_Model","291276503_BJUT-3D_large_scale_3D_face_database_and_information_processing","288955214_Real-time_mimicking_of_estonian_speaker's_mouth_movements_on_a_3D_avatar_using_Kinect_2","284041529_Spacetime_faces_High_resolution_capture_for_modeling_and_animation"]}
