{"id":"346516238_Modeling_low-_and_high-order_feature_interactions_with_FM_and_self-attention_network","abstract":"Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has always been a very popular topic. In many online applications, such as online advertising and product recommendation, a small increase in CTR will bring great returns. However, CTR prediction has always faced several challenges. A large number of users and items and the different sizes of the feature space of different data types lead to high-dimensional and sparse input, and high-order feature interactions rely too much on expert knowledge and are very time-consuming. In this paper, we build a novel model called multi-order interactive features aware factorization machine (MoFM) for CTR prediction. To effectively capturing both low-order and high-order interactive features, three different types of prediction models are integrated, of which logistic regression (LR) and factorization machine (FM) model the original features and 2-order interactive features respectively, and a multi-head self-attention network with residual connections is used to automatically identify high-value high-order feature combinations. There is also an embedding layer in the model to realize a unified embedding processing of different data types, avoiding diversification, sparsity, and high dimensionality of features. Since, feature engineering is not required, we can carry out end-to-end model learning. Experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art models, and the flexibility and scalability of the model structure have also been verified.","authors":["Cairong Yan","Yizhou Chen","Yongquan Wan","Pengwei Wang"],"meta":["June 2021Applied Intelligence 51(4):1-13","DOI:10.1007/s10489-020-01951-6"],"references":["333713976_Temporal_pattern_attention_for_multivariate_time_series_forecasting","330372535_A_novel_approach_based_on_multi-view_reliability_measures_to_alleviate_data_sparsity_in_recommender_systems","329913166_Feature_Selection_and_Enhanced_Krill_Herd_Algorithm_for_Text_Document_Clustering","326496839_Deep_Interest_Network_for_Click-Through_Rate_Prediction","325992812_Incorporating_reliable_virtual_ratings_into_social_recommendation_systems","325318844_Hybrid_clustering_analysis_using_improved_krill_herd_algorithm","321379962_Deep_Cross_Network_for_Ad_Click_Predictions","337962070_A_social_recommender_system_based_on_reliable_implicit_relationships","337017101_AutoInt_Automatic_Feature_Interaction_Learning_via_Self-Attentive_Neural_Networks","328465867_An_effective_social_recommendation_method_based_on_user_reputation_model_and_rating_profile_enhancement","318829508_DeepFM_A_Factorization-Machine_based_Neural_Network_for_CTR_Prediction","319151536_Attentional_Factorization_Machines_Learning_the_Weight_of_Feature_Interactions_via_Attention_Networks","318830051_Attentional_Factorization_Machines_Learning_the_Weight_of_Feature_Interactions_via_Attention_Networks","318764240_Neural_Factorization_Machines_for_Sparse_Predictive_Analytics","317558625_Attention_Is_All_You_Need"]}
