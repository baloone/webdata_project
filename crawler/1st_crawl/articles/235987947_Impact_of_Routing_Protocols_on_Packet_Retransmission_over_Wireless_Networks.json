{"id":"235987947_Impact_of_Routing_Protocols_on_Packet_Retransmission_over_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"TCP is known to exhibit poor performance in wireless networks.\nVarious parameters may be considered to configure the network functioning and with multi-hop wireless connectivity,.\nMany routing protocols could be used over WSN. \n\nIn this paper,we show that the choice of the routing protocol (and its parameters) will surely have an impact on the whole network functioning. \nWe foccus, in particular, on packet retransmission process which is an usual process which used by a node when the network is disturbed (traffic jam, non connected nodes, ..)\nHowever, multihop end-to-end transmissions require cooperation of several layers of the communication protocol stack. At each layer different mechanisms and protocols are used, each of them have set default values. \nIn this paper, we investigate how these layers are designed and we consider taking a look at default configurations of the layersÕ parameters/mechanisms and comparing them to alternative possibilities. We also explore cross-layer effects between layers and how they affect the performance.\nin this paper, we analyze the impact of usual routing protocols such as Direct Diffusion, AODV, AOMDV, DSDV and DSR on the packet retransmission used by the Transport layer. These analyses are conducted through the NS-2 simulator to analyze a relevant indicator: the RTT value.","authors":["Thibault Bernard","Hacène Fouchal","Sébastien Linck","Estelle Perrin"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2013.6654996","Conference: International Conference on Communications"],"references":["258145390_MAC_Protocols_Used_by_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_a_General_Method_of_Performance_Evaluation","236172768_Classification_and_comparison_of_routing_protocols_in_wireless_sensor_networks","313753301_Performance_Comparison_of_Two_On-demand_Routing_Protocols_for_Ad_hoc_Networks","306311675_AN_ENERGY_EFFICIENT_FITNESS_BASED_ROUTING_PROTOCOL_IN_WIRELESS_SENSOR_NETWORKS","284602927_Ad_hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","263525318_Performance_Evaluation_of_Routing_Protocols_for_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks_Parallel_Processing_Issues_in_Mobile_Computing_Guest_Editors_Mohan_Kumar_and_Albert_Zomaya","258124372_Exploring_Newtonian_mechanics_in_a_conceptually-integrated_digital_game_Comparison_of_learning_and_affective_outcomes_for_students_in_Taiwan_and_the_United_States","257171366_Building_virtual_cities_inspiring_intelligent_citizens_Digital_games_for_developing_students'_problem_solving_and_learning_motivation","247393587_Request_for_Comments_Ad_hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","243765362_End_to_End_Congestion_Avoidance_on_a_Global_Internet"]}
