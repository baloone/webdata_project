{"id":"317163533_Data_analytics_vs_data_science_A_study_of_similarities_and_differences_in_undergraduate_programs_based_on_course_descriptions","abstract":"The rate at which data is produced and accumulated today is greater than at any point in history with little prospect of slowing. As organizations attempt to collect and analyze this data, there is a tremendous unmet demand for appropriately skilled knowledge workers. In response, universities are developing degree programs in data science and data analytics. As a contribution to the design and development of these programs, this paper presents findings from a review of the descriptions of courses offered in a small sample of undergraduate programs in data science and data analytics. Our investigation clarifies and illustrates the similarities and differences between undergraduate data analytics and data science programs.
