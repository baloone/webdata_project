{"id":"335590923_Panoptyk_information_driven_MMO_engine","abstract":"Project Panoptyk is a game engine designed to run Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games with information creation, sharing, and exchange as the central gameplay focus. This engine is a work in progress, intended to serve as a platform for simulating human/robot interaction, as well as automatic generation of game assets, quests, and real-estate. The project also aims to create an open platform allowing indie and research communities to experiment with MMO concepts. In pursuit of these goals, we identify and address a number of challenges that have traditionally made it difficult for independent designers or researchers to be competitive in creation of new MMO games.","authors":["Mitchell Miller","Sean Mendonca","Nathan Philliber","Foaad Khosmood"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1145/3337722.3341835","Conference: the 14th International Conference"],"references":["262327212_Procedural_Content_Generation_for_Games_A_Survey","254007560_If_You_Build_It_They_Might_Stay_Retention_Mechanisms_in_World_of_Warcraft","221514963_Project_massive_a_study_of_online_gaming_communities","220686344_Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_games_The_past_present_and_future","309280537_Procedural_Content_Generation_in_Games","221391409_A_distributed_architecture_for_MMORPG","6598675_Motivations_for_Play_in_Online_Games"]}
