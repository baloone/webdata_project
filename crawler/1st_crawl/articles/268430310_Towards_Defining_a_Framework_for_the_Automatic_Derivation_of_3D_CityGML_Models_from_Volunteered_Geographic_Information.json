{"id":"268430310_Towards_Defining_a_Framework_for_the_Automatic_Derivation_of_3D_CityGML_Models_from_Volunteered_Geographic_Information","abstract":"High-quality geographic data sources are eminent for urban data management and the creation of detailed 3D city models. In the last two decades, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) increasingly gained attractiveness to both amateur users and professionals, resulting in a broad availability of urban data within VGI communities and especially OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM provides detailed information about urban regions and especially more and more buildings are also mapped. Existing 3D applications of VGI only focus on visualization purposes, but a standardized usage for exchanging and sharing urban city models is not combined with VGI. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for an automatic creation of 3D building models encoded as standardized CityGML models, based on VGI. That is, the usage of VGI as a proper data source for the creation of standardized city models will be proven.","authors":["Marcus Goetz","Alexander Zipf"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.4018/ij3dim.2012040101","Project: OpenStreetMap Data Quality Analytics (VGI Big Spatial Data Analytics)"],"references":["266894794_Empirische_Untersuchungen_zur_Datenqualitat_von_OpenStreetMap_-_Erfahrungen_aus_zwei_Jahren_Betrieb_mehrerer_OSM-Online-Dienste","266334963_A_Comparative_Study_of_Proprietary_Geodata_and_Volunteered_Geographic_Information_for_Germany","242096639_Semi-automatic_generation_of_full_CityGML_models_from_images","237443110_CityGML_-_Interoperable_access_to_3D_city_models","314410007_Image-based_procedural_modeling_of_facades","300362169_Interoperable_location_based_services_for_3D_cities_on_the_web_using_user_generated_content_from_OpenStreetMap","285995029_CityGML_-_3D_city_models_for_emergency_response","258255672_Open_GIS_city_geography_markup_language_City_GML_encoding_standard","255020136_Extraction_of_facades_using_RJMCMC_and_constraint_equations","243766664_3D-city_modeling_with_a_digital_one-eye_stereo_system","228658394_Spatial_data_infrastructure_techniques_for_flexible_noise_mapping_strategies","228352293_The_virtual_3D_city_model_of_Berlin_-_Managing_integrating_and_communicating_complex_urban_information","234794674_Geography_Mark-Up_Language_Foundation_for_the_Geo-Web","228677093_A_Semantic_Model_of_Stairs_in_Building_Collars","228363028_Flexible_generation_of_semantic_3D_building_models"]}
