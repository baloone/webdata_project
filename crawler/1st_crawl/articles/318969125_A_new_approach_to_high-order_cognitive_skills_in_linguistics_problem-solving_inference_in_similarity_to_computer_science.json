{"id":"318969125_A_new_approach_to_high-order_cognitive_skills_in_linguistics_problem-solving_inference_in_similarity_to_computer_science","abstract":"A central issue in the design of curricula for all school levels is the development of the learnersâ€™ high-order thinking skills and metacognitive skills. Among such required skills is the ability to solve problems. The literature dealing with the development of problem-solving skills is vast and primarily addresses the scientific disciplines, even though the importance of integrating such skills into all disciplines is widely mentioned. The current study aims to compare problem-solving questions used in two seemingly different disciplines: linguistics and computer science. Our premise was that the basis for imparting problem-solving skills is asking problem-solving questions. We analysed problem-solving questions posed in various teaching and learning school scenarios for keywords, and identified nine categories of problem-solving question keywords common to both disciplines. We present those categories and extend our study of two categories to demonstrating the ability to follow the problem-solving process in linguistics is similar to the exact sciences.","authors":["Gila Shilo","Noa Ragonis"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Further and Higher Education 43(1):1-14","DOI:10.1080/0309877X.2017.1361515","Project: Computer Science Education"],"references":["303809631_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","299853792_Evaluation_of_the_effects_of_argumentation_based_science_teaching_on_5th_grade_students'_understanding_of_the_subjects_related_to_Matter_and_Change","289805286_Type_of_questions_-_The_case_of_computer_science","281211216_Melioration_as_a_higher_thinking_skill_of_future_intelligence","250185023_IMPROVE_A_Multidimensional_Method_for_Teaching_Mathematics_in_Heterogeneous_Classrooms","239062773_Education_and_Learning_to_Think","291942326_Energizing_learning","268309485_Problem_solving_and_programming_concepts_3rd_ed","262400701_What_is_it_we_are_asking_Interpreting_problem-solving_questions_in_computer_science_and_linguistics","245104165_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_revision_of_Bloom''s_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objec"]}
