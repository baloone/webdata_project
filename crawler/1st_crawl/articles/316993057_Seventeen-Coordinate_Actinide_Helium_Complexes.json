{"id":"316993057_Seventeen-Coordinate_Actinide_Helium_Complexes","abstract":"The geometries and electronic structures of molecular ions featuring He atoms complexed to actinide cations are explored computationally using density functional and coupled cluster theories. A new record coordination number is established, as AcHe17(3+) , ThHe17(4+) , and PaHe17(4+) are all found to be true geometric minima, with the He atoms clearly located in the first shell around the actinide. Analysis of AcHen(3+) (n=1-17) using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) confirms these systems as having closed shell, charge-induced dipole bonding. Excellent correlations (R(2) >0.95) are found between QTAIM metrics (bond critical point electron densities and delocalization indices) and the average Ac-He distances, and also with the incremental He binding energies.","authors":["Nikolas Kaltsoyannis"],"meta":["May 2017Angewandte Chemie International Edition 56(25)","DOI:10.1002/anie.201700245"],"references":["282812321_Cobalt-centred_boron_molecular_drums_with_the_highest_coordination_number_in_the_CoB16-_cluster","275672913_Thorium-ligand_multiple_bonds_via_reductive_deprotection_of_a_trityl_group","275049830_Characterizing_Pressure-Induced_Uranium_CH_Agostic_Bonds","265793375_The_Strength_of_Actinide-Element_Bonds_from_the_Quantum_Theory_of_Atoms_in_Molecules","311765177_Computational_study_of_An-X_bonding_An_Th_U_X_p-block-based_ligands_in_pyrrolic_macrocycle-supported_complexes_from_the_quantum_theory_of_atoms_in_molecules_and_bond_energy_decomposition_analysis","303830563_CsH_2_NB_2_C_6_F_5_6_Featuring_an_Unequivocal_16-Coordinate_Cation","303502665_Organometallic_neptuniumIII_complexes","289571639_Covalency_hinders_AnO_2_H_2_O_AnOOH_2_isomerisation_An_Pa-Pu","253339304_Do_QTAIM_metrics_correlate_with_the_strength_of_heavy_element-ligand_bonds","244993856_Inhomogeneous_Electron_Gas","244406768_14-Coordinate_uraniumIV_Structure_of_uranium_borohydride_by_single-crystal_neutron_diffraction","239089452_Beitrag_zur_Konstitution_anorganischer_Verbindungen_XI_Mitteilung","228015153_Synthesis_and_Properties_of_a_Fifteen-Coordinate_Complex_The_Thorium_Aminodiboranate_ThH3BNMe2BH34","225271820_ChemInform_Abstract_Does_Covalency_Increase_or_Decrease_Across_the_Actinide_Series_Implications_for_Minor_Actinide_Partitioning","223417703_Segmented_contraction_scheme_for_small-core_actinide_pseudopotential_basis_sets","221904119_Superatomic_orbitals_in_sixteen-coordinate_MLi16_bonded_by_metallic_bonds","201877587_Self-Consistent_Equations_Including_Exchange_and_Correlation_Effects","46951139_Atoms_in_Molecules_A_Quantum_Theory","42346699_Synthesis_and_Properties_of_a_Fifteen-Coordinate_Complex_The_Thorium_Aminodiboranate_ThH3BNMe2BH34","13228890_Generalized_Gradient_Approximation_Made_Simple","6491069_The_Search_for_the_Species_with_the_Highest_Coordination_Number"]}
