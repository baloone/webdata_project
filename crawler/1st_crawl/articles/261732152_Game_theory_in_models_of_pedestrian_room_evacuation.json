{"id":"261732152_Game_theory_in_models_of_pedestrian_room_evacuation","abstract":"We analyze the pedestrian evacuation of a rectangular room with a single door considering a lattice gas scheme with the addition of behavioral aspects of the pedestrians. The movement of the individuals is based on random and rational choices and is affected by conflicts between two or more agents that want to advance to the same position. Such conflicts are solved according to certain rules closely related to the concept of strategies in game theory, cooperation and defection. We consider game rules analogous to those from the Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games, with payoffs associated to the probabilities of the individuals to advance to the selected site. We find that, even when defecting is the rational choice for any agent, under certain conditions, cooperators can take advantage from mutual cooperation and leave the room more rapidly than defectors.","authors":["Sebasti√°n Bouzat","Marcelo N Kuperman"],"meta":["March 2014Physical Review E 89(3-1):032806","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.89.032806","SourcePubMed"],"references":["291871762_Pedestrian_and_evacuation_dynamics","253489305_Constructal_theory_of_pedestrian_dynamics","252879299_Cellular_Automata_Microsimulation_of_Bidirectional_Pedestrian_Flows","251588786_Room_evacuation_in_the_presence_of_an_obstacle","251588752_Conflict_game_in_evacuation_process_A_study_combining_Cellular_Automata_model","251588718_Study_of_bottleneck_effect_at_an_emergency_evacuation_exit_using_cellular_automata_model_mean_field_approximation_analysis_and_game_theory","245104224_A_Taxonomy_of_2_2_Games","243970871_Evolutionary_Games_and_Population_Dynamics","243566554_Self-Organized_Phase_Transitions_in_Cellular_Automaton_Models_for_Pedestrians","239619220_Spatio-temporal_distribution_of_escape_time_in_evacuation_process"]}
