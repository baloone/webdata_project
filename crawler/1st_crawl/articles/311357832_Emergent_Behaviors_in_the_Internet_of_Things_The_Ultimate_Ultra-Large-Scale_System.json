{"id":"311357832_Emergent_Behaviors_in_the_Internet_of_Things_The_Ultimate_Ultra-Large-Scale_System","abstract":"To reach its potential, the Internet of Things (IoT) must break down the silos that limit applications' interoperability and hinder their manageability. Doing so leads to the building of ultra-large-scale systems (ULSS) in several areas, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart grids. The scope of ULSS is both large and complex. Thus, the authors propose Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB), a paradigm that builds on the concepts of emergent behavior and hierarchical organization. Rather than explicitly programming all possible decisions in the vast space of ULSS scenarios, HEB relies on the emergent behaviors induced by local rules at each level of the hierarchy. The authors discuss the modifications to classical IoT architectures required by HEB, as well as the new challenges. They also illustrate the HEB concepts in reference to autonomous vehicles. This use case paves the way to the discussion of new lines of research.","authors":["Damian Roca","Daniel Nemirovsky","Mario Nemirovsky","Rodolfo Milito"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Micro 36(6):36-44","DOI:10.1109/MM.2016.102"],"references":["301232922_Self-Organization_in_Social_Insects","264273952_Coordination_and_navigation_of_heterogeneous_MAV-UGV_formations_localized_by_a_'hawk-eye'-like_approach_under_a_model_predictive_control_scheme","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","313203353_The_architecture_of_complexity","304750276_Architecting_Principles_for_Systems-of-Systems","269309216_Internet_of_vehicles_From_intelligent_grid_to_autonomous_cars_and_vehicular_clouds","262486793_Self-Organized_Criticality_Emergent_Complex_Behavior_in_Physical_and_Biological_Systems","261339052_Ultra-large_scale_control_architecture","258968410_Ultra-Large-Scale_Systems_-_The_Software_Challenge_of_the_Future","257523156_Towards_a_swarm_of_agile_micro_quadrotors","238750471_Designing_emergent_behaviors_From_local_interactions_to_collective_intelligence","235709967_Flocks_Herds_and_Schools_A_Distributed_Behavioral_Model","3021481_Smart_cars_on_smart_roads_Problems_of_control"]}
