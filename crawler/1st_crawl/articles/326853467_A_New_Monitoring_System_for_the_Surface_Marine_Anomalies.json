{"id":"326853467_A_New_Monitoring_System_for_the_Surface_Marine_Anomalies","abstract":"Today, widespread growth in the world is intertwined with multichannel monitoring systems based on remote sensing. Such systems allow for the collection of operational information that focuses on the environmental status of marine systems on different scales. The technique of identifying real-time abnormal phenomena in the marine environment requires the presence of algorithmic remote sensing measurements and appropriate software. The present study presents a new monitoring system for remotely sensed anomalies on the marine surface, equipped with a “spotting” model based on empirical data. The experimental verification of the efficiency of the system and the algorithms developed was based on data from the Cosmos-1500 satellite for several seas. Finally, it is stressed that the proposed system, in addition to water, can also be used to detect abnormal phenomena in both air and soil.","authors":["Ferdenant A.
