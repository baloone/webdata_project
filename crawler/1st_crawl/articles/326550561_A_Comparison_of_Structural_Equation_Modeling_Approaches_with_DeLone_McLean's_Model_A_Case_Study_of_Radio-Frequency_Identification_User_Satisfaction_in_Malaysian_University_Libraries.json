The main objective is to apply Delone and McLean's IS success model for radio-frequency identification (RFID) sustainability in Malaysian university libraries. Two approaches are applied to estimate user satisfaction, such as the Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation approaches. In order to identify the best approach, four mathematical indices are used, namely root mean squared error, absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and the coefficient of determination. The results reveal that Bayesian estimation provides good fit to the data, unlike the model with the maximum likelihood estimator. This study addresses the causes for this difference between the two approaches, as well as the potential merits and shortcomings of the maximum likelihood approach. The current study presents a novel and practical modeling and prediction concept for researchers and experts in the field of computer science.","authors":["Noudoostbeni Ali","Kiran Kaur","Hashem Salarzadeh Jenatabadi"],"meta":["July 2018Sustainability 10(7):2532","DOI:10.3390/su10072532"],"references":["316258896_Understanding_mobile_banking_individual_performance_The_DeLone_McLean_model_and_the_moderating_effects_of_individual_culture","315065792_Visualising_the_Search_Landscape_of_the_Triangle_Program","312036354_The_Development_of_Reusable_Luggage_Tag_with_the_Internet_of_Things_for_Mobile_Tracking_and_Environmental_Sustainability","306523690_ePedigree_Traceability_System_for_the_Agricultural_Food_Supply_Chain_to_Ensure_Consumer_Health","323828098_The_Role_of_Transformational_Leadership_as_a_Mediating_Variable_in_DeLone_and_McLean_Information_System_Success_Model_The_Context_of_Online_Learning_usage_in_Yemen","320950254_Success_Factors_in_Developing_iHeart_as_a_Patient-centric_Healthcare_System_A_Multi-Group_Analysis","319239362_Proximity_Warning_and_Excavator_Control_System_for_Prevention_of_Collision_Accidents","318684449_Radio-frequency-identification_for_security_and_media_circulation_in_libraries","317774138_Visualizing_Topological_Properties_of_the_Search_Landscape_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error"]}
