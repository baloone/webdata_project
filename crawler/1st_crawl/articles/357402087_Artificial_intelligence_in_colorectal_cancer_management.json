{"id":"357402087_Artificial_intelligence_in_colorectal_cancer_management","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new branch of computer science involving many disciplines and technologies. Since its application in the medical field, it has been constantly studied and developed. AI includes machine learning and neural networks to create new technologies or to improve existing ones. Various AI supporting systems are available for a personalized and novel strategy for the management of colorectal cancer (CRC). This mini-review aims to summarize the progress of research and possible clinical applications of AI in the investigation, early diagnosis, treatment, and management of CRC, to offer elements of knowledge as a starting point for new studies and future applications.","authors":["Pasquale Cianci","Enrico Restini"],"meta":["December 2021","DOI:10.35713/aic.v2.i6.79"],"references":["351252313_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Colorectal_Cancer_Screening_Diagnosis_and_Treatment_A_New_Era","349884636_Establishment_and_Clinical_Application_of_an_Artificial_Intelligence_Diagnostic_Platform_for_Identifying_Rectal_Cancer_Tumor_Budding","344734904_The_emerging_role_of_super_enhancer-derived_noncoding_RNAs_in_human_cancer","343876254_Fighting_pandemics_with_digital_epidemiology","340847165_Artificial_Intelligence_in_radiotherapy_state_of_the_art_and_future_directions","338015727_Prediction_of_Colon_Cancer_Stages_and_Survival_Period_with_Machine_Learning_Approach","337567882_Comparing_Artificial_Intelligence_Platforms_for_Histopathologic_Cancer_Diagnosis","346317296_Use_of_artificial_intelligence_in_improving_adenoma_detection_rate_during_colonoscopy_Might_both_endoscopists_and_pathologists_be_further_helped","342483564_Performance_of_artificial_intelligence_for_colonoscopy_regarding_adenoma_and_polyp_detection_a_meta-analysis","337862902_Artificial_intelligence_in_cancer_diagnosis_and_prognosis_Opportunities_and_challenges"]}
