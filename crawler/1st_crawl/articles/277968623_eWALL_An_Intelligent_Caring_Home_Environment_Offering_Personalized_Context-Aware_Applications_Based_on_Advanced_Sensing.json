{"id":"277968623_eWALL_An_Intelligent_Caring_Home_Environment_Offering_Personalized_Context-Aware_Applications_Based_on_Advanced_Sensing","abstract":"Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population. Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors.","authors":["Sofoklis Kyriazakos","Mihail Mihaylov","Bayu Anggorojati","Albena Mihovska"],"meta":["May 2015Wireless Personal Communications 87(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-015-2779-2"],"references":["263327466_Provisioning_Quality_of_Service_of_Wireless_Telemedicine_for_E-Health_Services_A_Review","226687085_Wireless_Aspects_of_Telehealth","283032149_Wireless_ZigBee_home_automation_system","274382968_Wearable_sensors_for_health_monitoring","271471664_An_overview_of_cloud_middleware_services_for_interconnection_of_healthcare_platforms"]}
