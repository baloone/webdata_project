{"id":"309475116_Automatized_Assessment_of_Protective_Group_Reactivity_A_Step_Toward_Big_Reaction_Data_Analysis","abstract":": In this paper we report a new method of assessment of protective groups (PGs) reactivity as a function of reaction conditions (catalyst, solvent) using raw reaction data. It is based on intuitive similarity principle for chemical reactions: similar reactions proceed under similar conditions. Techni-cally, reaction similarity can be assessed using the Condensed Graph of Reaction (CGR) approach rep-resenting an ensemble of reactants and products as one sole molecular graph, i.e., as a pseudomolecule for which molecular descriptors or fingerprints can be calculated. CGR-based in-house tools were used to process data for 142111 catalytic hydrogenation reactions extracted from the Reaxys database. Our results reveal some contradictions with famous Greeneâ€™s Reactivity Charts based on manual expert analysis and demonstrate high performance (some 90%) of prediction of optimal experimental condi-tions of desired reactivity of protective groups.","authors":["Arkadii Lin","Timur I Madzhidov","Olga Klimchuk","Ramil I.
