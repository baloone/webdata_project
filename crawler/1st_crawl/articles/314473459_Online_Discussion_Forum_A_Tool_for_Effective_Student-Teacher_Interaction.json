{"id":"314473459_Online_Discussion_Forum_A_Tool_for_Effective_Student-Teacher_Interaction","abstract":"The problem of communication between students and teachers in an educational institution has become a major concern. This is because some students find it difficult to participate in classroom lectures because of their inability to socialize; also lecturers do not often have enough time to elaborate on the topics they have to teach for a particular class, hence, the decline in studentsâ€™ understanding of a given topic. The advent of computer mediated communication (CMC) has given rise to the development of online forum for effective communication. This journal highlights the structure and features of an online forum which makes it an effective communication tool between the lecturer and students of an institution.","authors":["Helen Biriyai","Victor Emmah"],"meta":["January 2014SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2525047"],"references":["263162138_Student_interactions_in_online_discussion_forum_empirical_research_from_'Media_Richness_Theory'_perspective","245945535_Discussion_Board_A_Learning_Object","237295386_Online_Social_Interchange_Discord_and_Knowledge_Construction","228641754_Towards_a_Typology_of_Virtual_Communities_of_Practice","222407026_Instructional_video_in_e-learning_Assessing_the_impact_of_interactive_video_on_learning_effectiveness","238353601_An_electronic_tutorial_A_teaching_innovation_for_tourism_management_studies","232893519_Evaluation_of_an_Online_Masters_Course_in_Science_Teacher_Education","227681612_Learning_within_incoherent_structures_The_space_of_online_discussion_forums_Journal_of_Computer_Assisted_Learning_18_351-366","48306486_Building_Knowledge_Building_Communities_Consistency_Contact_and_Communication_in_the_Virtual_Classroom"]}
