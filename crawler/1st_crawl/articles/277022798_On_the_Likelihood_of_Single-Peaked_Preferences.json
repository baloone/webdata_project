{"id":"277022798_On_the_Likelihood_of_Single-Peaked_Preferences","abstract":"This paper contains an extensive combinatorial analysis of the single-peaked\ndomain restriction and investigates the likelihood that an election is\nsingle-peaked. We provide a very general upper bound result for domain\nrestrictions that can be defined by certain forbidden configurations. This\nupper bound implies that many domain restrictions (including the single-peaked\nrestriction) are very unlikely to appear in a random election chosen according\nto the Impartial Culture assumption. For single-peaked elections, this upper\nbound can be refined and complemented by a lower bound that is asymptotically\ntight. In addition, we provide exact results for elections with few voters or\ncandidates. Moreover, we consider the Polya urn model and the Mallows model and\nobtain lower bounds showing that single-peakedness is more likely to appear\nunder these probability distributions.","authors":["Marie-Louise Bruner","Martin Lackner"],"meta":["April 2017Social Choice and Welfare 48(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00355-017-1033-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278332564_The_one-dimensional_Euclidean_domain_Finitely_many_obstructions_are_not_enough","266896647_Voters'_preference_diversity_concepts_of_agreement_and_Condorcet's_paradox","265218180_Robust_Winners_and_Winner_Determination_Policies_under_Candidate_Uncertainty","262236212_Efficient_vote_elicitation_under_candidate_uncertainty","286475219_On_detecting_nearly_structured_preference_profiles","279561336_Bounded_single-peaked_width_and_proportional_representation","277023476_Central_binomial_coefficients_also_count_2431423114324132-avoiders","265445639_Restricted_Permutations","262642568_Theoretical_and_empirical_evaluation_of_data_reduction_for_exact_Kemeny_Rank_Aggregation","262240368_Kemeny_Elections_with_Bounded_Single-peaked_or_Single-crossing_Width"]}
