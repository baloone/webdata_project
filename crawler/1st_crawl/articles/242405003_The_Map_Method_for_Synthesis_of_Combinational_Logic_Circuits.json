{"id":"242405003_The_Map_Method_for_Synthesis_of_Combinational_Logic_Circuits","abstract":"THE SEARCH for simple abstract techniques to be applied to the design of switching systems is still, despite some recent advances, in its early stages. The problem in this area which has been attacked most energetically is that of the synthesis of efficient combinational that is, nonsequential, logic circuits.","authors":["M.
