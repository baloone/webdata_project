{"id":"311425189_COMPUTERS_COULD_BE_MORE_HELPFUL_IN_COMPREHENDING_COUNTRIES","abstract":"This article argues for connected (super)computers being deployed in scientific and collaborative country-studies in the age of globalization and ‘convergence of knowledge’. It attempts appealing not only to researchers in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, human-computer interaction, conceptual modeling, knowledge organization (KO), knowledge management (KM), big data analytics, and soft – and cognitive computing, but also to social and human scientists, on whose expertise foreign policies are usually based. Dreaming like late Joseph Licklider, the visionary whose impact is still felt in computer science, the author presents a challenge no self-respecting computer expert or ‘country connoisseur’ can afford to ignore.","authors":["Hans Kuijper"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":[]}
