{"id":"317957311_Integrating_Architecture_and_Crime_Science_A_Transdisciplinary_Challenge","abstract":"The influence of products and urban structures on citizens’ security has been explored and exploited across civilisations. Rarely, though, has the research in this field been as vibrant as now. Examples of research and development work can be found in many disciplines and on various scales. They concern the design of street furniture to prevent bicycle theft, identification of urban topological structures that can reduce drug dealing, development of structures that can resist pressure waves from explosive devices, and improvement of buildings’ resilience to toxic agents. In spite of this breadth of knowledge, there is still a significant gap between architecture, design and crime science. To shed a light on the underexploited connections between these disciplines, we examine the cultural and methodological differences that characterise them. Using the problem-solving approach promoted by crime scientists as support for cross-disciplinary analysis, we then discuss its compatibility with architecture and design practices. Finally, we summarise our analysis with a list of recommendations for the development of postgraduate course curricula that support collaborative work in security and crime science.","authors":["H.
