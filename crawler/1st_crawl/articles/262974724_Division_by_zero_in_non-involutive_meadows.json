{"id":"262974724_Division_by_zero_in_non-involutive_meadows","abstract":"Meadows have been proposed as alternatives for fields with a purely\nequational axiomatization. At the basis of meadows lies the decision to make\nthe multiplicative inverse operation total by imposing that the multiplicative\ninverse of zero is zero. Thus, the multiplicative inverse operation of a meadow\nis an involution. In this paper, we study `non-involutive meadows', i.e.\\\nvariants of meadows in which the multiplicative inverse of zero is not zero,\nand pay special attention to non-involutive meadows in which the multiplicative\ninverse of zero is one.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","C.
