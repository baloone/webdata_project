{"id":"305388779_Neural_Semantic_Encoders","abstract":"We present a memory augmented neural network for natural language understanding: Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE). NSE has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and maintains the understanding of input sequences through read, compose and write operations. NSE can access multiple and shared memories depending on the complexity of a task. We demonstrated the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different natural language tasks, natural language inference, question answering, sentence classification, document sentiment analysis and machine translation where NSE achieved state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on publically available benchmarks. For example, our shared-memory model showed an encouraging result on neural machine translation, improving an attention-based baseline by approximately 1.0 BLEU.","authors":["Tsendsuren Munkhdalai","Hong Yu"],"meta":["July 2016"],"references":["306094026_A_Fast_Unified_Model_for_Parsing_and_Sentence_Understanding","284626887_Wit3_Web_inventory_of_transcribed_and_translated_talks","284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","282181875_Reasoning_about_Entailment_with_Neural_Attention","279310212_Ask_Me_Anything_Dynamic_Memory_Networks_for_Natural_Language_Processing","273067823_Improved_Semantic_Representations_From_Tree-Structured_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","269117118_Deep_Learning_for_Answer_Sentence_Selection","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","221344862_Curriculum_learning","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","320736303_Neural_Tree_Indexers_for_Text_Understanding","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319769995_End-To-End_Memory_Networks","311990523_A_Decomposable_Attention_Model_for_Natural_Language_Inference","305334400_Learning_Natural_Language_Inference_with_LSTM","303840186_A_Decomposable_Attention_Model_for_Natural_Language_Inference","301880883_Long_Short-Term_Memory-Networks_for_Machine_Reading","301446024_Document_Modeling_with_Gated_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Sentiment_Classification","301445887_WikiQA_A_Challenge_Dataset_for_Open-Domain_Question_Answering","289758666_Recurrent_continuous_translation_models","284219033_Neural_Programmer-Interpreters","284218982_Neural_Variational_Inference_for_Text_Processing","284039049_Recursive_deep_models_for_semantic_compositionality_over_a_sentiment_treebank","281227635_A_large_annotated_corpus_for_learning_natural_language_inference","277959017_Learning_to_Transduce_with_Unbounded_Memory","270877716_Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models","269997813_Grammar_as_a_Foreign_Language","269935592_Modeling_Compositionality_with_Multiplicative_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267157056_Neural_Turing_Machines","267046290_Memory_Networks","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","262416109_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_and_Documents","259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","222449846_Finding_Structure_in_Time"]}
