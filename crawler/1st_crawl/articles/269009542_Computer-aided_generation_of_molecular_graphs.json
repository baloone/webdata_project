{"id":"269009542_Computer-aided_generation_of_molecular_graphs","abstract":"An effective algorithm and a program for a generation of all nonisomorphic molecular graphs from a set of labeled vertices with a given valence are described. The algorithm allows apriori specification of information about forbidden and necessary fragments in the graphs to be generated. Examples of applications are given.","authors":["Sergey G Molodtsov"],"meta":["January 1994MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 30(30)"],"references":[]}
