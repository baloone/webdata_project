{"id":"309675083_Reducing_lexical_complexity_as_a_tool_to_increase_text_accessibility_for_children_with_dyslexia","abstract":"Lexical complexity plays a central role in readability, particularly for dyslexic children and poor\nreaders because of their slow and laborious decoding and word recognition skills. Although some\nfeatures to aid readability may be common to many languages (e.g., the majority of ’easy’ words\nare of low frequency), we believe that lexical complexity is mainly language-specific. In this\npaper, we define lexical complexity for French and we present a pilot study on the effects of\ntext simplification in dyslexic children. The participants were asked to read out loud original and\nmanually simplified versions of a standardized French text corpus and to answer comprehension\nquestions after reading each text. The analysis of the results shows that the simplifications per-\nformed were beneficial in terms of reading speed and they reduced the number of reading errors\n(mainly lexical ones) without a loss in comprehension. Although the number of participants in\nthis study was rather small (N=10), the results are promising and contribute to the development\nof applications in computational linguistics","authors":["Nuria Gala","Johannes C Ziegler"],"meta":["November 2016","Conference: Computational Linguistics for Linguistic Complexity (COLING 2016 Workshop)At: Osaka, Japan.","Project: Reading Aids to leverage Document Accessibility for Children with Dyslexia (ANR project, 2016-2020)"],"references":["308468949_Developmental_dyslexia_in_different_languages_Language-specific_or_universal","278768984_Syntactic_Sentence_Simplification_for_French","266459589_A_First_Approach_to_the_Creation_of_a_Spanish_Corpus_of_Dyslexic_Texts","264876549_FLELex_a_graded_lexical_resource_for_French_foreign_learners","259268750_Modelling_reading_development_through_phonological_decoding_and_self-teaching_Implications_for_dyslexia","237109087_What_reading_does_for_the_mind","228755539_Eye_Fixation_Patterns_Among_Dyslexic_and_Normal_Readers_Effects_of_Word_Length_and_Word_Frequency","225184694_Extra-large_letter_spacing_improves_reading_in_dyslexia","8516027_MANULEX_A_grade-level_lexical_database_from_French_elementary_school_readers","215470768_Probabilistic_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Decision_Trees"]}
