{"id":"345628775_Three-Dimensional_Microwave_Imaging_Fast_and_Accurate_Computations_with_Block_Resolution_Algorithms","abstract":"This paper considers the microwave imaging reconstruction problem, based on additive penalization and gradient-based optimization. Each evaluation of the cost function and of its gradient requires the resolution of as many high-dimensional linear systems as the number of incident fields, which represents a large amount of computations. Since all such systems involve the same matrix, we propose a block inversion strategy, based on the block-biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGStab) algorithm, with efficient implementations specific to the microwave imaging context. Numerical experiments performed on synthetic data and on real measurements show that savings in computing time can reach a factor of two compared to the standard, sequential, BiCGStab implementation. Improvements brought by the block approach are even more important for the most difficult reconstruction problems, that is, with high-frequency illuminations and/or highly contrasted objects. The proposed reconstruction strategy is shown to achieve satisfactory estimates for objects of the Fresnel database, even on the most contrasted ones.","authors":["Corentin FRIEDRICH","Sébastien Bourguignon","Jérôme Idier","Yves GOUSSARD"],"meta":["November 2020Sensors 20(21)","DOI:10.3390/s20216282"],"references":["270000974_Wavelet-Based_Regularization_for_Robust_Microwave_Imaging_in_Medical_Applications","267367123_A_feasibility_study_on_Microwave_Imaging_for_brain_stroke_monitoring","319073796_A_Hybrid_Regularization_Technique_for_Solving_Highly_Nonlinear_Inverse_Scattering_Problems","309720562_Metamodel-Based_Nested_Sampling_for_Model_Selection_in_Eddy-Current_Testing","285906939_Numerical_optimization","284086601_Grain_bin_monitoring_via_electromagnetic_imaging","261686985_A_discrete_BCG-FFT_algorithm_for_solving_3D_inhomogeneous_scatter_problems","260541113_Cauchy_Data_Contrast_Source_Inversion_Method","260504049_Electromagnetic_Scattering_From_3-D_Targets_in_a_Random_Medium_Using_Finite_Difference_Frequency_Domain","258655378_A_Three-Dimensional_Model-Based_Inversion_Algorithm_Using_Radial_Basis_Functions_for_Microwave_Data"]}
