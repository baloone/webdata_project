{"id":"318901719_Using_a_gamified_mobile_app_to_increase_student_engagement_retention_and_academic_achievement","abstract":"This study investigated whether the use of a gamified mobile learning app influenced students' academic performance and boosted their engagement in the subject. Created to better engage students in lecture content, the app was used to deliver multiple-choice content-based quizzes directly to students' personal mobile devices post-lecture and pre-tutorial. After measuring the relationships between students' app usage and their engagement, retention and academic achievement in the subject, it is suggested that following the app's introduction, student retention rates and academic performance increased, and there was a positive correlation between students' scoring highly on the app and achieving higher academic grades. While the app's affordances for learning are promising, the causal relationship between the app usage and improved student outcomes requires further investigation. Conclusions made in the context of the wider scholarship of mobile app enhanced learning and applied game principles in HE.","authors":["Ekaterina Pechenkina","Daniel Laurence","Grainne Oates","Daniel Eldridge"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1186/s41239-017-0069-7","Project: Critical approaches to educational technologies"],"references":["322237857_How_notifications_influence_participants_in_asynchronous_discussion_forums_A_case_study","315655059_Developing_a_typology_of_mobile_apps_in_Higher_Education_A_national_case-study","304463020_Designing_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_to_account_for_participant_motivations_and_expectations","303958281_Interactive_Spaced_Online_Education_in_Pediatric_Trauma","319523471_A_sense_of_belonging_Improving_student_retention","315530260_Utilization_of_an_educational_web_based_mobile_app_for_acquisition_and_transfer_of_critical_anatomical_knowledge_thereby_increasing_classroom_and_laboratory_preparedness_in_veterinary_students","315348111_A_Mobile-Based_Surgical_Simulation_Application_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Efficacy_Using_a_Carpal_Tunnel_Release_Module","314294339_Creating_Engaging_Exercises_With_Mobile_Response_System_MRS","309687010_The_Effects_of_the_Flipped_Model_of_Instruction_on_Student_Engagement_and_Performance_in_the_Secondary_Mathematics_Classroom","303223883_Towards_the_Gamification_of_Learning_Investigating_Student_Perceptions_of_Game_Elements"]}
