{"id":"326393366_From_Natural_Language_to_Programming_Language","abstract":"Programming remains a dark art for beginners or even professional programmers. Experience indicates that one of the first barriers for learning a new programming language is the rigid and unnatural syntax and semantics. After analysis of research on the language features used by non-programmers in describing problem solving, the authors propose a new program synthesis framework, dialog-based programming, which interprets natural language descriptions into computer programs without forcing the input formats. In this chapter, they describe three case studies that demonstrate the functionalities of this program synthesis framework and show how natural language alleviates challenges for novice programmers to conduct software development, scripting, and verification.","authors":["Xiao Liu","Dinghao Wu"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-5969-6.ch004","In book: Innovative Methods, User-Friendly Tools, Coding, and Design Approaches in People-Oriented Programming (pp.110-130)"],"references":["325990151_Automated_Synthesis_of_Access_Control_Lists","314669698_Natural_Shell_An_Assistant_for_End-User_Scripting","281625032_PiE_Programming_in_Eliza","273137014_Natural_Notation_for_the_Domestic_Internet_of_Things","268349570_Natural_Language-Based_Software_Analyses_and_Tools_for_Software_Maintenance","301404450_Building_a_Semantic_Parser_Overnight","290015764_Natural_Language_Programming","286185623_Creating_interactive_web_data_applications_with_spreadsheets","271545143_Teach_and_try_A_simple_interaction_technique_for_exploratory_data_modelling_by_end_users","266656640_NLyze_Interactive_programming_by_natural_language_for_spreadsheet_data_analysis_and_manipulation"]}
