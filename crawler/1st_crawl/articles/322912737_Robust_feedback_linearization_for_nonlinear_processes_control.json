{"id":"322912737_Robust_feedback_linearization_for_nonlinear_processes_control","abstract":"In this research, a robust feedback linearization technique is studied for nonlinear processes control. The main contributions are described as follows: 1) Theory says that if a linearized controlled process is stable, then nonlinear process states are asymptotically stable, it is not satisfied in applications because some states converge to small values; therefore, a theorem based on Lyapunov theory is proposed to prove that if a linearized controlled process is stable, then nonlinear process states are uniformly stable. 2) Theory says that all the main and crossed states feedbacks should be considered for the nonlinear processes regulation, it makesmore difficult to find the controller gains; consequently, only themain states feedbacks are utilized to obtain a satisfactory result in applications. This introduced strategy is applied in a fuel cell and a manipulator.","authors":["Jose de Jesus Rubio"],"meta":["March 2018ISA Transactions 74:155-164","DOI:10.1016/j.isatra.2018.01.017"],"references":["316703526_Stability_of_active_disturbance_rejection_control_for_uncertain_systems_A_Lyapunov_perspective_AN_ADRC_STABILITY_ANALYSIS","310757685_Stabilization_of_the_PVTOL_aircraft_based_on_a_sliding_mode_and_a_saturation_function","273393244_Gain-Scheduled_-Optimal_Control_of_Variable-Speed-Variable-Pitch_Wind_Turbines","260586146_Adaptive_Control_of_a_Variable-Speed_Variable-Pitch_Wind_Turbine_Using_Radial-Basis_Function_Neural_Network"]}
