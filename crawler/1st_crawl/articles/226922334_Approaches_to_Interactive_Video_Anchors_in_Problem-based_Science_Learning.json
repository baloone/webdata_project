{"id":"226922334_Approaches_to_Interactive_Video_Anchors_in_Problem-based_Science_Learning","abstract":"This paper is an invited adaptation of the IEEE Education Society Distinguished Lecture Approaches to Interactive Video Anchors\nin Problem-Based Science Learning. Interactive video anchors have a cognitive theory base, and they help to enlarge the context\nof learning with information-rich real-world situations. Carefully selected movie clips and custom-developed regular videos\nand virtual simulations have been successfully used as anchors in problem-based science learning. Examples discussed include\na range of situations such as Indiana Jones tackling a trap, a teenager misrepresenting lead for gold, an agriculture inspection\nat the US border, counterintuitive events, analyzing a river ecosystem for pollution, and finding the cause of illness in\na nineteenth century river city. Suggestions for teachers are provided.","authors":["David Devraj Kumar"],"meta":["February 2010Journal of Science Education and Technology 19(1):13-19","DOI:10.1007/s10956-009-9154-6"],"references":["267839564_Students'_Motivation_and_Learning_of_Science_in_a_Multi-User_Virtual_Environment","250461301_SEQUENCING_PROBLEM_SOLVING_AND_HANDS_ON_ACTIVITIES_DOES_IT_MATTER","27236160_The_Effectiveness_of_Problem-Based_Instruction_A_Comparative_Study_of_Instructional_Methods_and_Student_Characteristics","7469592_Problem-based_learning_and_the_medical_school_Another_case_of_the_emperor's_new_clothes","6297078_Different_outcomes_of_active_and_reflective_students_in_problem-based_learning","308099235_Because_wisdom_can't_be_told","303151043_The_Aims_of_Education","284589646_Situated_cognition_and_problem-based_learning_Implications_for_learning_and_instruction_with_technology","255567435_Problem-Based_Multimedia_Software_for_Middle_Grades_Science_Development_Issues_and_an_Initial_Field_Study","248970898_Integrating_Science_and_Language_Arts_through_Technology-based_Macrocontexts","243681009_Toward_the_development_of_flexibly_adaptive_instructional_designs","239060987_A_Restatement_of_the_Relation_of_Reflective_Thinking_To_The_Educative_Process","239052755_What_doctors_can_teach_teachers_about_problem-based_learning","237631559_Essential_Components_of_Problem-Based_Learning_for_the_K-12_Inquiry_Science_Instruction","230876708_Problem-Based_Learning_An_Approach_to_Medical_Education","228016315_Macro-contexts_for_learning_Initial_findings_and_issues","227788307_Some_Benefits_of_Creating_Macro-Contexts_for_Science_Instruction_Initial_Findings","227186962_The_influence_of_discussion_groups_in_a_case-based_learning_environment","226058376_Effect_of_a_Problem_Based_Simulation_on_the_Conceptual_Understanding_of_Undergraduate_Science_Education_Students","225683040_Dynamic_visual_support_for_story_comprehension_and_mental_model_building_by_young_at-risk_children","49548367_How_we_Think","35217062_Orchestrating_classroom_change_to_engage_children_in_the_process_of_scientific_reasoning_challenges_for_teachers_and_strategies_for_success","14991425_Foundations_of_Problem-Based_Learning_Some_Explanatory_Notes"]}
