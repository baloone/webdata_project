{"id":"311332579_What_makes_continued_mobile_gaming_enjoyable","abstract":"Earlier mobile game studies have largely focused on the pre-adoption phase while ignoring the post-adoption behaviors. Additionally, while the intrinsic factor of enjoyment is often considered important in affecting game play, little research has attempted to understand its drivers. To fill these gaps, we examine the role of enjoyment as a motive for continual mobile game use, and the key antecedents of enjoyment. Applying our two-dimensional classification of artifact-related attributes, we adopt game design attributes of challenge, variety, novelty, and design aesthetics; and playability attributes of ease of use, and interactivity, and measure their impact on enjoyment, and its effect on continuance intention. The model is tested against 207 actual users of various mobile games. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed for data analysis. The findings put ease of use, novelty, design aesthetic, and challenge under the spotlight. We conclude that continual mobile game use is strongly driven by enjoyment, which in turn is primarily driven by the system's capacity of regeneration and visually attractive and easy-to-use interface. The implications are discussed in the paper.","authors":["Jani Merikivi","Virpi Kristiina Tuunainen","Nguyen Duyen"],"meta":["December 2016Computers in Human Behavior 68","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.070"],"references":["283721732_Nonadopters_of_Online_Social_Network_Services_Is_It_Easy_to_Have_Fun_Yet","266145593_Enjoying_the_possibility_of_defeat_Outcome_uncertainty_suspense_and_intrinsic_motivation","262391489_Contextual_factors_and_continuance_intention_of_mobile_services","259583577_Video_game_uses_and_gratifications_as_predictors_of_use_and_game_preference","257927901_Mobile_Gaming_Perceived_Enjoyment_and_Ease_of_Play_as_Predictors_of_Student_Attitude_and_Mobile_Gaming_Continuance_Intention","253800504_Mobile_games_Analyzing_the_needs_and_values_of_the_consumers","236154285_Task_Characteristics_and_the_Experience_of_Optimal_Flow_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","235320747_Customer_loyalty_to_content-based_Web_sites_The_case_of_an_online_health-care_service","234775714_FUN","232452540_The_Effects_of_Externally_Mediated_Rewards_on_Intrinsic_Motivation","229981287_Defining_Media_Enjoyment_as_the_Satisfaction_of_Intrinsic_Needs","228668939_The_effects_of_trust_and_enjoyment_on_intention_to_play_online_games","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","227442204_Measuring_the_Customer_Experience_in_Online_Environments_A_Structural_Modeling_Approach","226407406_Intentions_to_Use_Model_Services_Antecedents_and_Cross-Service_Comparisons","224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","318494438_Flow_the_psychology_of_optimal_experience","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","311344344_Definitions_key_characteristics_and_generations_of_mobile_games","295251017_Enhancing_perceived_enjoyment_in_social_games_through_social_and_gaming_factors","288668122_Flow_and_media_enjoyment","279766957_Understanding_Member_Use_of_Social_Networking_Sites_A_Value_Analysis","274039871_Enjoyment_At_the_Heart_of_Media_Entertainment","273946930_Chris_Crawford_on_Game_Design","262294328_Factors_affecting_Chinese_Ubiquitous_Game_Service_usage_intention","259590686_Extrinsic_versus_intrinsic_motivation_in_continued_Twitter_usage","254370825_A_Model_of_Flow_Experience_as_Determinant_of_Positive_Attitudes_Toward_Online_Advergames","247887258_Elucidating_Individual_Intention_to_Use_Interactive_Information_Technologies_The_Role_of_Network_Externalities","244486324_Understanding_the_effect_of_flow_on_user_adoption_of_mobile_games","239794571_Selective_Exposure_To_Televised_Comedy_Programs","238687478_Making_learning_fun_A_taxonomy_of_intrinsic_motivations_for_learning","235300657_Global_Youth_and_Mobile_Games_Applying_the_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_the_USA_Japan_Spain_and_the_Czech_Republic","234786324_Mobile_games_2010","232497058_A_Motivational_Model_of_Video_Game_Engagement","231383795_Mood_Management_Through_Communication_Choices","229888027_Comparing_the_Perceived_Value_of_Information_and_Entertainment_Mobile_Services","229514608_Extrinsic_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_to_Use_Computers_in_the_Workplace1","228349373_Flow_Online_Lessons_Learned_and_Future_Prospects","227673312_Flow_and_Media_Enjoyment","227635293_Determining_Uses_and_Gratifications_for_the_Internet","227623606_Enjoyment_At_the_Heart_of_Media_Entertainment","227535785_Consumer_Adoption_of_Wireless_Services_Discovering_the_rules_While_Playing_the_Game","227446834_Empirical_Evaluation_of_the_Revised_Technology_Acceptance_Model","223355527_An_empirical_analysis_of_the_antecedents_of_electronic_commerce","223082293_Adoption_of_the_mobile_Internet_An_empirical_study_of_multimedia_message_service_MMS","222854620_Personality_and_enjoyment_of_computer_game_play","222701943_Extending_the_TAM_for_a_World-Wide-Web_context","222688653_Designing_website_attributes_to_induce_experiential_encounters","222686562_Why_do_people_play_on-line_games_An_extended_TAM_with_social_influences_and_flow_experience","222448281_Toward_a_Theory_of_Intrinsically_Motivating_Instruction","222270809_Hedonic_and_utilitarian_shopping_goals_The_online_experience","222398993_Digital_game-based_learning_Towards_an_experiential_gaming_model","222348040_Factors_influencing_the_usage_of_websites_The_case_of_a_generic_portal_in_The_Netherlands","222318655_Antecedents_of_perceived_playfulness_An_exploratory_study_on_user_acceptance_of_general_information-searching_websites","222141355_The_effects_of_post-adoption_beliefs_on_the_expectation-confirmation_model_for_information_technology_continuance_International_Journal_of_Human_Computer_Studies_649_799-810"]}
