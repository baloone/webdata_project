{"id":"259920867_Wikiometrics_A_Wikipedia_Based_Ranking_System","abstract":"We present a new concept - Wikiometrics - the derivation of metrics and\nindicators from Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides an accurate representation of the\nreal world due to its size, structure, editing policy and popularity. We\ndemonstrate an innovative mining methodology, where different elements of\nWikipedia - content, structure, editorial actions and reader reviews - are used\nto rank items in a manner which is by no means inferior to rankings produced by\nexperts or other methods. We test our proposed method by applying it to two\nreal-world ranking problems: top world universities and academic journals. Our\nproposed ranking methods were compared to leading and widely accepted\nbenchmarks, and were found to be extremely correlative but with the advantage\nof the data being publically available.","authors":["Lior Rokach","Gilad Katz"],"meta":["November 2017World Wide Web 20(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11280-016-0427-8"],"references":["298030482_WikiRevolutions_Wikipedia_as_a_Lens_for_Studying_the_Real-time_Formation_of_Collective_Memories_of_Revolutions","285458829_Wikipedia_Ranking_of_World_Universities","262245295_A_ranking_framework_for_entity_oriented_search_using_Markov_Random_fields","256291608_Early_Prediction_of_Movie_Box_Office_Success_Based_on_Wikipedia_Activity_Big_Data","264959932_Robust_Nonparametric_Statistical_Methods","261857400_The_cluster_hypothesis_for_entity_oriented_search","260416015_Theoretical_and_Interpretation_Challenges_to_Using_the_Author_Affiliation_Index_Method_to_Rank_Journals","256660325_Exploiting_the_category_structure_of_Wikipedia_for_entity_ranking","256660317_Evaluating_Entity_Linking_with_Wikipedia","256031115_Wikipedia_Research_and_Tools_Review_and_Comments","242511035_Scaling_Wikipedia-based_Named_Entity_Disambiguation_to_Arbitrary_Web_Text","238783050_History_Criticism_and_Reform","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment","236274479_Time_evolution_of_Wikipedia_network_ranking","236147351_Eigenfactor_Measuring_the_value_and_prestige_of_scholarly_journals"]}
