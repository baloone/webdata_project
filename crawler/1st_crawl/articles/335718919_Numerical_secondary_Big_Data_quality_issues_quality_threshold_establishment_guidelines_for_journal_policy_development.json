Sometimes, acquiring primary Big Data is infeasible due to availability, accessibility, cost, time, and/or complexity considerations. In this paper, we focus on Big Data-based IS research and discuss ways in which one may, post hoc, establish quality thresholds for numerical Big Data obtained from secondary sources. We also present guidelines for developing journal policies aimed at ensuring the veracity and verifiability of such data when used for research purposes.\n\nAnyone clicking on this link before January 02, 2020 will be taken directly to the final version of your article on ScienceDirect, which they are welcome to read or download.
