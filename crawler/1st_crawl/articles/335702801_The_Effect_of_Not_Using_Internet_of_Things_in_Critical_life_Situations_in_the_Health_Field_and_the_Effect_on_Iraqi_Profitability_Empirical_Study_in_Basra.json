One of its most important aspects concerns how to bind IOT to enhance healthcare in Iraq. This study was conducted at the College of Computer Science and Information Technology. It discussed the effect of not using IOT to manage critical life-threatening situations in Iraqi healthcare. In this study, we considered IOT technology, particularly the DRONE ambulance, using real data collected via a random questionnaire study in Basra. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 0.23. At the end of the study, we identified the factors that could have affected the use of IOT technology: awareness, security, cost, governmental support, collaboration, and professional behavior. The results showed that collaboration affected the use of IOT technology.","authors":["Hisham Noori","Alaa Khalaf","Fatima Alaa Hussain"],"meta":["August 2019Xinan Jiaotong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University 54(4)","DOI:10.35741/issn.0258-2724.54.4.2"],"references":["321093251_Building_Data_Warehouse_for_Diseases_Registry_First_Step_for_Clinical_Data_Warehouse","319165523_Online_Real_Time_Fuzzy_Inference_System_Based_Human_Health_Monitoring_and_Medical_Decision_Making","313388440_Augmented_Reality_and_the_Internet_of_Things","313375159_Factor_Influencing_Salaries_and_Wage_Order_Empirical_Study_at_Basra_University","346747631_MANETS_and_Internet_of_Things_The_Development_of_a_Data_Routing_Algorithm","345719755_Centralized_Fog_Computing_Security_Platform_for_IoT_and_Cloud_in_Healthcare_System","330796588_Software_Defined_Networks_in_Internet_of_Things_Integration_Security_Challenges_and_Solutions","328852969_Hybrid_homomorphic_cryptosystem_for_secure_transfer_of_color_image_on_public_cloud","326185793_Design_of_drone_ambulance","323439412_The_Effect_of_Tax_System_on_Shareholder_Decisions_when_Choosing_a_Accounting_Principles","311805463_A_Review_and_Model_Development_of_the_Factors_that_Affect_Mobile_Marketing_Acceptance_by_Customers","309638033_A_Vision_of_IoT_Applications_Challenges_and_Opportunities_With_China_Perspective","309313445_Applying_Association_Rules_and_Decision_Tree_Algorithms_with_Tumor_Diagnosis_Data","309240603_Design_and_Implementing_Cancer_Data_Warehouse_to_Support_Clinical_Decisions","308633568_Design_and_Implementing_Cancer_Data_Warehouse_to_Support_Clinical_Decisions"]}
