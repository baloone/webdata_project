{"id":"245508482_Assessment_in_Statistics_Education_Issues_and_Challenges","abstract":"There have been many changes in educational assessment in recent years, both within the fields of measurement and evaluation and in specific disciplines. In this article, we summarize current assessment practices in statistics education, distinguishing between assessment for different purposes and assessment at different educational levels. To provide a context for assessment of statistical learning, we first describe current learning goals for students. We then highlight recent assessment methods being used for different purposes: individual student evaluation, large-scale group evaluation, and as a research tool. Examples of assessment used in teaching statistics in primary schools, secondary schools, and tertiary schools are given. We then focus on 3 examples of effective uses of assessment and conclude with a description of some current assessment challenges.","authors":["Joan Garfield","Beth Chance"],"meta":["April 2000Mathematical Thinking and Learning 2(1):99-125","DOI:10.1207/S15327833MTL0202_5"],"references":["267836469_6_Using_Real-Life_Problems_to_Prompt_Students_to_Construct_Conceptual_Models_for_Statistical_Reasoning","265080617_0_Assessing_Students'_Statistical_Problem-solving_Behaviors_in_a_Small-group_Setting","255663258_Controversies_Around_the_Role_of_Statistical_Tests_in_Experimental_Research","247782341_The_Assessment_Challenge_in_Statistics_Education","246561672_Issues_in_Assessing_Conceptual_Understanding_in_Probability_and_Statistics","240354719_Toward_Understanding_the_Role_of_Technological_Tools_in_Statistical_Learning","236857751_Assessment_in_Statistics_Using_the_Personal_Computer","234590839_Teaching_probability_through_modeling_real_problems","233470347_Informal_Conceptions_of_Probability","226075396_Cognitive_models_and_problem_spaces_in_purely_random_situations","2737957_Student_Projects_on_Statistical_Literacy_and_the_Media","347459484_Statistics_in_the_Classroom_Written_Projects_Portraying_Real-World_Situations","333292545_Teaching_Statistical_Concepts","321450887_Experiences_with_Authentic_Assessment_Techniques_in_an_Introductory_Statistics_Course","289963556_Assessment_Standards_for_School_Mathematics","286270780_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","285909328_Classroom_Assessment_Techniques","275848747_The_Assessment_Challenge_in_Statistics_Education","275628026_Review_of_Teaching_Statistical_Concepts","271814076_Difficulties_in_Learning_Basic_Concepts_in_Probability_and_Statistics_Implications_for_Research","269903300_Judgement_under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biasses","267468474_Statistical_Case_Studies_A_Collaboration_between_Academe_and_Industry","266472543_5_A_Framework_for_Assessing_Knowledge_and_Learning_in_Statistics_K-8","265746043_3_Authentic_Assessment_Models_for_Statistics_Education","248423265_What_is_the_use_of_experiments_conducted_by_statistics_students","245931581_Dimensions_in_the_assessment_of_students''understanding_and_application_of_chance","245635225_Challenges_in_assessing_statistical_reasoning","245508511_Assessment_and_the_Process_of_Learning_Statistics","245507950_Assessing_students''connected_understanding_of_statistical_relationships","240182139_Portfolio_assessment_in_graduate_level_statistics_courses","238160360_A_framework_for_assessing_and_nurturing_young_children''s_thinking_in_probability","234710509_Results_from_the_Fourth_Mathematics_Assessment_of_the_National_Assessment_of_Educational_Progress","232480061_Research_in_probability_and_statistics_Reflections_and_directions","227647468_New_Pedagogy_and_New_Content_The_Case_of_Statistics","227494829_Classroom_Research_Implementing_the_Scholarship_of_Teaching","221945195_Judgment_under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","200022414_Beyond_Testing_and_Grading_Using_Assessment_To_Improve_Student_Learning","35284844_Stages_of_concern_of_mathematics_teachers_regarding_the_Curriculum_and_Evaluation_Standards_for_School_Mathematics","35209118_A_cross-cultural_study_of_sex_differences_in_statistical_reasoning_for_college_students_in_Taiwan_and_the_United_States","20153555_Use_of_nonparametric_correlation_analysis_in_graduate_students_research_projects"]}
