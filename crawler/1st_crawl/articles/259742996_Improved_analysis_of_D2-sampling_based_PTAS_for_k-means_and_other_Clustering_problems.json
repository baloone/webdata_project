The improvement on the running time is from $O\\left(nd \\cdot\n2^{\\tilde{O}(k^2/\\epsilon)}\\right)$ to $O\\left(nd \\cdot\n2^{\\tilde{O}(k/\\epsilon)}\\right)$.","authors":["Ragesh Jaiswal","Mehul Kumar","Pulkit Yadav"],"meta":["January 2014Information Processing Letters 115(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2014.07.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221209374_Bregman_Clustering_for_Separable_Instances","220780363_Coresets_and_Approximate_Clustering_for_Bregman_Divergences","220780273_Clustering_for_metric_and_non-metric_distance_measures","220431812_Linear-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Clustering_Problems_in_Any_Dimensions","220390396_Clustering_for_Metric_and_Nonmetric_Distance_Measures","51990674_A_Simple_D_2-Sampling_Based_PTAS_for_k-Means_and_other_Clustering_Problems","220617873_On_Coresets_for_k_-Median_and_k_-Means_Clustering_in_Metric_and_Euclidean_Spaces_and_Their_Applications"]}
