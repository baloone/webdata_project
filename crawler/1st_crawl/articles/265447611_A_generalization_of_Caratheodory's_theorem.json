{"id":"265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","abstract":"The following theorem is proved. If the sets and conv Vi, then there exist elements viϵVi (i=1…,n+1) such that aϵconv{v1,…,vn+1}. This is generalization of Carathéodory's theorem. By applying this and similar results some open questions are answered.","authors":["Imre Bárány"],"meta":["December 1982Discrete Mathematics 40(2-3)","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(82)90115-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["244954707_A_Generalization_of_Radon's_Theorem","268764470_Generalizations_of_a_theorem_of_Caratheodory","268243753_Convex_Polytopes_and_the_Upper_Bound_Conjecture","260908489_Convex_Polytopes","244956494_A_generalization_of_Radon's_theorem_II","242984435_On_some_combinatorial_questions_in_finite-dimensional_spaces","242648091_Hellys_Theorem_and_its_relatives","36305392_Generalizations_of_a_theorem_of_Caratheodory","27288176_Convex_Analysis"]}
