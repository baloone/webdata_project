{"id":"2552293_Programs_with_Common_Sense","abstract":"This paper will discuss programs to manipulate in a suitable formal lan- guage (most likely a part of the predicate calculus) common instrumental statements. The basic program will draw immediate conclusions from a list of premises. These conclusions will be either declarative or imperative sentences. When an imperative sentence is deduced the program takes a corresponding action. These actions may include printing sentences, moving sentences on lists. and reinitiating the basic deduction process on these lists. Facilities will be provided for communication with humans in the system via manual intervention and display devices connected to the computer","authors":["John Mccarthy"],"meta":["March 2002"],"references":[]}
