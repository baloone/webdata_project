{"id":"271224245_Variance_of_Entropy_Decreases_Under_the_Polar_Transform","abstract":"We consider the behavior of entropy of data elements as they are operated on\nby polar transforms. The data elements under consideration are pairs $(X,Y)$\nwhere $X$ is a binary random variable and $Y$ is some side information about\n$X$. The entropy random variable for such a data element is defined as $h(X|Y)\n= -\\log p_{X|Y}(X|Y)$. The variance of entropy (varentropy) is defined as\n$\\var(h(X|Y))$. A polar transform of order two is a mapping that takes two\nindependent data elements and produces two new data elements (that are in\ngeneral correlated). We show that the sum of the varentropies of the output\ndata elements is less than or equal to the sum of the varentropies of the input\ndata elements, with equality if and only if at least one of the input data\nelements has zero varentropy. This result is then extended to polar transforms\nof higher orders and an asymptotic analysis is given for an important special\ncase in which the average output varentropy decreases monotonically to zero as\nthe transform size increases.","authors":["Erdal ArÄ±kan"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62(6)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2555841","SourcearXiv"],"references":["230883257_Polar_Codes_Robustness_of_the_Successive_Cancellation_Decoder_withRespect_to_Quantization","224132864_Channel_Coding_Rate_in_the_Finite_Blocklength_Regime","314735145_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","283465456_Polar_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Systems","279334757_PROBABILITY_MEASURES_IN_A_METRIC_SPACE","269269616_A_simple_proof_of_polarization_and_polarization_for_non-stationary_channels","266256256_Asymptotische_Abschatzungen_in_Shannons_Informationstheorie","261128018_Optimal_lossless_compression_Source_varentropy_and_dispersion","224506304_Channel_Polarization_A_Method_for_Constructing_Capacity-Achieving_Codes_for_Symmetric_Binary-Input_Memoryless_Channels","224157754_Source_Polarization","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220692418_Modern_Coding_Theory","200524258_Information_Theory_and_Reliable_Communication","38365199_Association_of_Random_Variables_with_Applications","3082305_A_theorem_on_the_entropy_of_certain_binary_sequences_and_applications--I"]}
