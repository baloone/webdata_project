{"id":"261047323_A_longitudinal_study_of_the_effects_of_a_high_school_robotics_and_computational_thinking_class_on_academic_achievement_WIP","abstract":"While there has been a rising interest in computational thinking (CT) and a push to include it into the K-12 curriculum, there is little empirical evidence that a class that teaches CT will have any measurable long-term effects on student performance. Using robotics as an example of CT instruction, I propose to examine a high school that has had a large number of robotics students over the past six years to find evidence for the long-term benefits of CT. I will analyze school records (e.g. STEM class enrollment, STEM test scores, SAT scores) for differences between robotics and non-robotics students and compare interviews with selected students.","authors":["Pat Ko"],"meta":["October 2013Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference","DOI:10.1109/FIE.2013.6684812","Conference: Frontiers in Education Conference, 2013 IEEEAt: Oklahoma City, OK"],"references":["234812396_Education_Paving_the_way_for_computational_thinking","221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","221537927_Computational_thinking","220420371_Computational_thinking","271672066_Robotics_as_Means_to_Increase_Achievement_Scores_in_an_Informal_Learning_Environment","252339056_Effects_of_LEGO_Mindstorms_on_convergent_and_divergent_problem-solving_and_spatial_abilities_in_fifth_and_sixth_grade_students","247499664_Advanced_constructional_play_with_LEGOs_among_preschoolers_as_a_predictor_of_later_school_achievement_in_mathematics","234802762_A_plea_for_modesty","234802053_The_present_and_future_of_computational_thinking","223753783_Does_lego_training_stimulate_pupils'_ability_to_solve_logical_problems","220374731_The_Effect_of_LEGO_Training_on_Pupils'_School_Performance_in_Mathematics_Problem_Solving_Ability_and_Attitude_Swedish_Data"]}
