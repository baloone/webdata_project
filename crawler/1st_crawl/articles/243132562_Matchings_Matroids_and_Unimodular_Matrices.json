{"id":"243132562_Matchings_Matroids_and_Unimodular_Matrices","abstract":"We focus on combinatorial problems arising from symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices. For much of the thesis we consider properties concerning the principal submatrices. In particular, we are interested in the property that every nonsingular principal submatrix is unimodular; matrices having this property are called principally unimodular. Principal unimodularity is a generalization of total unimodularity, and we generalize key polyhedral and matroidal results on total unimodularity....","authors":["James F.
