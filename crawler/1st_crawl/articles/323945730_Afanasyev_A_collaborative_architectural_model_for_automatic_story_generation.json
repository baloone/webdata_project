{"id":"323945730_Afanasyev_A_collaborative_architectural_model_for_automatic_story_generation","abstract":"The present article focuses on detailing the characteristics\nof Afanasyev, an architectural framework for the construction of\nstory generation systems through replaceable services. The basic idea\nbehind this approach is the development of a collaborative environment\nfor generating stories. This entails the inclusion of a common\nrepresentation model to allow the interoperation between different\nstory generation systems as a base for a collaborative environment to\nrun an enhanced process of literary creation. In addition to this objective,\nthis model aims at the development of a story representation\nformalism for creating a common knowledge base that can be fed in\nthe future with the outcomes of new storytelling systems, without the\nneed to adapt it to every system-specific representation model.","authors":["Eugenio Concepción","Pablo Gervás","Gonzalo Méndez"],"meta":["April 2018","Conference: 5th AISB Symposium on Computational CreativityAt: Liverpool, UK","Project: Idylico"],"references":["321918076_An_API-based_Approach_to_Co-creation_in_Automatic_Storytelling","321917883_A_Common_Model_for_Representing_Stories_in_Automatic_Storytelling","320057720_A_microservice-based_architecture_for_story_generation","305687541_Mining_Knowledge_in_Storytelling_Systems_for_Narrative_Generation","305214346_Using_CNL_for_Knowledge_Elicitation_and_Exchange_Across_Story_Generation_Systems","305214305_Reasoning_in_Attempto_Controlled_English_Non-monotonicity","294087668_On_the_Use_of_Character_Affinities_for_Story_Plot_Generation","289890098_Propp's_morphology_of_the_folk_tale_as_a_grammar_for_generation","262308599_Service_-Oriented_Computing_Concepts_Characteristics_and_Directions","285319204_Story_Plot_Generation_based_on_CBR"]}
