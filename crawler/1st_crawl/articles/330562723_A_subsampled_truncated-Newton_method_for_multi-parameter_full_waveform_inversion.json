{"id":"330562723_A_subsampled_truncated-Newton_method_for_multi-parameter_full_waveform_inversion","abstract":"Accounting for the Hessian in full waveform inversion (FWI) can lead to higher convergence rates, improved resolution, and better mitigation of parameter trade-off in multi-parameter problems. In spite of these advantages, the adoption of second-order optimization methods (e.g., truncated Newton (TN)) has been precluded by their high computational cost. We introduce a subsampled truncated Newton (STN) algorithm for time-domain FWI with applications presented for the elastic isotropic case. By employing uniform or non-uniform source subsampling during the computation of Hessian-vector products, we reduce the number of partial differential equation (PDE) solves required per iteration when compared to the conventional TN algorithm. We evaluate the performance of STN through synthetic inversions on the Marmousi II and BP 2.5D models, using the LBFGS and TN algorithms as benchmarks. We demonstrate that STN reaches a target misfit reduction at an overall cost comparable to first-order gradient methods, while retaining favourable convergence properties of TN methods. Furthermore, we present an example where non-uniform sampling outperforms uniform sampling in STN due to highly non-uniform source contributions to the Hessian.","authors":["Gian Matharu","Mauricio Sacchi"],"meta":["January 2019Geophysics 84(3):1-33","DOI:10.1190/geo2018-0624.1"],"references":["303992986_Optimization_Methods_for_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning","294088436_Acoustic_multi-parameter_FWI_for_the_reconstruction_of_P-wave_velocity_density_and_attenuation_preconditioned_truncated_Newton_approach","276949012_Marmousi2_An_elastic_upgrade_for_Marmousi","269629332_Fast_full_waveform_inversion_with_source_encoding_and_second-order_optimization_methods","266614832_A_guided_tour_of_multiparameter_full-waveform_inversion_with_multicomponent_data_From_theory_to_practice","266614752_Full_Waveform_Inversion_and_the_Truncated_Newton_Method","258787710_Anisotropic_3D_full-waveform_inversion","249865886_Target-oriented_wave-equation_inversion","247091672_P-SV_wave_propagation_in_hetero-geneous_media_Velocity-stress_finite-difference_method_Geophysics","245083270_A_stochastic_estimator_of_the_trace_of_the_influence_matrix_for_Laplacian_smoothing_splines","243668757_A_Stochastic_Estimator_of_the_Trace_of_the_Influence_Matrix_for_Laplacian_Smoothing_Splines","228078301_P-SV_wave_propagation_in_heterogeneous_media_Velocity-stress_finite-difference_method","228078264_An_overview_of_full-waveform_inversion_in_exploration_geophysics","227762618_Hessian_kernels_of_seismic_data_functionals_based_upon_adjoint_techniques","220617443_Fast_Monte_Carlo_Algorithms_for_Matrices_I_Approximating_Matrix_Multiplication","215755519_Fourth-order_finite-difference_P-S","47503800_An_unsplit_convolutional_Perfectly_Matched_Layer_improved_at_grazing_incidence_for_the_seismic_wave_equation","329219062_Multiparameter_Deblurring_Filter_and_its_Application_to_Elastic_Migration_and_Inversion","326497147_A_Time-Domain_Preconditioned_Truncated_Newton_Approach_to_Visco-acoustic_Multiparameter_Full_Waveform_Inversion","326030369_Source_encoding_in_multiparameter_full_waveform_inversion","323270647_SeisFlows-Flexible_waveform_inversion_software","308692483_Exact_and_Inexact_Subsampled_Newton_Methods_for_Optimization","305426247_2D_frequency-domain_elastic_full-waveform_inversion_using_the_block-diagonal_pseudo-Hessian_approximation","304787780_Sub-sampled_Newton_Methods_with_Non-uniform_Sampling","299908318_Multi-parameter_full_wavefield_inversion_using_non-stationary_point-spread_functions","288495533_Comparison_of_multifrequency_selection_strategies_for_simultaneous-source_full-waveform_inversion","275371503_Seismic_AVO_and_the_inverse_Hessian_in_precritical_reflection_full_waveform_inversion","269065201_Target-oriented_wave-equation_inversion","258787609_Fast_waveform_inversion_without_source-encoding","257480049_Sample_Size_Selection_in_Optimization_Methods_for_Machine_Learning","255828729_Choosing_the_Forcing_Terms_in_an_Inexact_Newton_Method","249866332_Fast_full-waveform_seismic_inversion_using_encoded_sources","249865479_Phase_encoding_of_shot_records_in_prestack_migration","249856433_Strike_shooting_dip_shooting_widepatch_shooting_-_Does_prestack_depth_migration_care_A_model_study","240736286_A_strategy_for_non-linear_inversion_of_seismic_reflection_data","229772303_Gauss-Newton_and_full_Newton_methods_in_frequency-space_seismic_waveform_inversion","228671354_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_with_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","227670548_Elastic_Full_Waveform_Inversion_of_Multi-Component_OBC_Seismic_Data","227593899_Improved_amplitude_preservation_for_prestack_depth_migration_by_inverse","221678287_An_Algorithm_for_Least_Square_Estimation_of_Non-Linear_Parameters","220133612_On_the_Use_of_Stochastic_Hessian_Information_in_Optimization_Methods_for_Machine_Learning","215385384_An_Algorithm_for_Least-Squares_Estimation_of_Nonlinear_Parameter","51991541_A_Newton-CG_method_for_large-scale_three-dimensional_elastic_full-waveform_seismic_inversion","51935862_Erratum_Hybrid_Deterministic-Stochastic_Methods_for_Data_Fitting","4222014_Parallel_Multiscale_Gauss-Newton-Krylov_Methods_for_Inverse_Wave_Propagation"]}
