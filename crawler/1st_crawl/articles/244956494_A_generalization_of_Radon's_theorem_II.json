{"id":"244956494_A_generalization_of_Radon's_theorem_II","abstract":"A new proof is given of the following result: Let m and d be positive integers, and let a set of md + m âˆ’ d points be given in d-dimensional space. Then the set can be partitioned into m sets such that the m convex polytopes spanned by the sets have a non-empty intersection.","authors":["H.
