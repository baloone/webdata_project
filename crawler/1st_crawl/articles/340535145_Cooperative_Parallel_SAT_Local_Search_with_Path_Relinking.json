{"id":"340535145_Cooperative_Parallel_SAT_Local_Search_with_Path_Relinking","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the use of path relinking to improve the performance of parallel portfolio-based local search solvers for the Boolean Satisfiability problem. In the portfolio-based framework several algorithms explore the search space in parallel, either independently or cooperatively with some communication between the solvers. Path relinking is a method to maintain an appropriate balance between diversification and intensification (and explore paths that aggregate elite solutions) to properly craft a new assignment for the variables to restart from. We present an empirical study that suggest that path relinking outperforms a set of well-known parallel portfolio-based local search algorithms with and without cooperation.","authors":["Padraigh Jarvis","Alejandro Arbelaez"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-43680-3_6","In book: Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization (pp.83-98)"],"references":["267370075_A_New_Method_for_Solving_Hard_Satisfiability_Problems","220944505_UBCSAT_An_implementation_and_experimentation_environment_for_SLS_algorithms_for_SAT_and_MAX-SAT","220944465_Combining_Adaptive_Noise_and_Look-Ahead_in_Local_Search_for_SAT","220740639_A_Racing_Algorithm_for_Configuring_Metaheuristics","220643226_K_Tradeoffs_in_the_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Competing_Algorithm_Designs","220543148_ParamILS_An_Automatic_Algorithm_Configuration_Framework","220163323_ManySAT_a_parallel_SAT_solver","2936124_An_Adaptive_Noise_Mechanism_for_WalkSAT","2788263_A_Logic-Constrained_Knapsack_Formulation_and_a_Tabu_Algorithm_for_the_Daily_Photograph_Scheduling_of_an_Earth_Observation_Satellite","2637561_Noise_Strategies_for_Improving_Local_Search","310750889_CCEHC_An_efficient_local_search_algorithm_for_weighted_partial_maximum_satisfiability","305885981_New_local_search_methods_for_partial_MaxSAT","289862822_MAXSAT_heuristics_for_cost_optimal_planning","277896146_CCLS_An_Efficient_Local_Search_Algorithm_for_Weighted_Maximum_Satisfiability","265524393_Hybrid_metaheuristics_Second_international_workshop_HM_2005_Barcelona_Spain_August_29-30_2005_Proceedings","262329917_From_Sequential_to_Parallel_Local_Search_for_SAT","257551771_An_overview_of_parallel_SAT_solving","234898358_Tabu_Search_for_Nonlinear_and_Parametric_Optimization_With_Links_to_Genetic_Algorithms","228850599_Continuous_Search_in_Constraint_Programming_An_Initial_Investigation","224205874_Continuous_Search_in_Constraint_Programming","220814032_Backbone_Guided_Local_Search_for_Maximum_Satisfiability","220244110_Optimal_Protein_Structure_Alignment_Using_Maximum_Cliques","48415912_Improving_Parallel_Local_Search_for_SAT","29453465_Additive_versus_Multiplicative_Clause_Weighting_for_SAT","2588620_Criticality_and_Parallelism_in_Structured_SAT_Instances"]}
