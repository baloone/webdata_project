{"id":"318656597_Bridging_the_cultures_architecture_models_and_computers_in_1960s_Cambridge","abstract":"In the 1960s a unique research centre was founded in the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. Before that date research in architecture was fragmentary and consisted largely of individual studies of topics in architectural history. Under the direction of Sir Leslie Martin, who had been appointed Professor of Architecture in 1956, a group of young architecture graduates embarked on a programme of research in the newly established centre for Land Use and Built Form Studies. Informed by the interest in the idea of the ‘model’ that was prevalent across the disciplines in Cambridge at this time and by using the power of the University Mathematical Laboratory’s ‘Titan’ mainframe computer, the group developed conceptual and mathematical models that operated across the range of architectural scales from building to city. This paper describes that work and sets it in the context of Leslie Martin’s role in reshaping architectural education in Britain.","authors":["Dean Hawkes"],"meta":["April 2017Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 42(1-2):144-157","DOI:10.1080/03080188.2017.1297160"],"references":["327092701_Normed_Space_Structures","299569992_Research_in_architecture_and_urban_studies_at_Cambridge_in_the_1960s_and_1970s_What_really_happened","287727999_Development_of_a_model_of_urban_spatial_structure","285732437_Architect's_approach_to_architecture","275695122_Circle_International_Survey_of_Constructive_Art","274300995_Urban_Space_and_Structures","270420305_Mathematics_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_Other_Essays","245465140_The_planning_of_single-storey_layouts","239542641_Models_and_Analogies_in_Science","230402097_The_cambridge_multiple-access_system_in_retrospect"]}
