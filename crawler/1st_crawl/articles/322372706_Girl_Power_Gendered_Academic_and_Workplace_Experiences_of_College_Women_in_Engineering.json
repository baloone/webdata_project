{"id":"322372706_Girl_Power_Gendered_Academic_and_Workplace_Experiences_of_College_Women_in_Engineering","abstract":"Women in engineering continue to experience bias in the field. This constructivist case study uses feminist theory to examine the gendered experiences of graduating senior women engineering students in academic and workplace environments. In each setting we identified three subthemes; in academia: “I don’t think my education is any different,” “Being underestimated constantly,” and “You don’t want to be seen as getting advantages”; in the workplace: “Oh, you’re a girl,” “There’s a lot of sexism,” and Benefits of “girl power.” Overall, findings indicate that women experience bias in both settings, often via implicit bias in academia and with instances of implicit bias, sexism, and sexual harassment occurring even more often in the workplace through internship experiences. The article concludes with suggestions for practice, future research, and strategies to create supportive academic and workplace experiences and environments for women engineers.","authors":["Kathleen Smith","Joy Gaston Gayles"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.3390/socsci7010011"],"references":["321485962_Setting_Up_for_the_Next_Big_Thing_Undergraduate_Women_Engineering_Students'_Postbaccalaureate_Career_Decisions","318267548_Gendered_Perceptions_of_Cultural_and_Skill_Alignment_in_Technology_Companies","318122016_A_Tale_of_Two_Majors_Explaining_the_Gender_Gap_in_STEM_Employment_among_Computer_Science_and_Engineering_Degree_Holders","316751247_Institutional_Transformation_Toward_a_Diversity-Positive_Campus_Culture","313850358_Looking_through_the_Glass_Ceiling_A_Qualitative_Study_of_STEM_Women's_Career_Narratives","343920155_Feminist_Theory_Reader_Local_and_Global_Perspectives","319031146_Focusing_on_Women_in_STEM_A_Longitudinal_Examination_of_Gender-Based_Earning_Gap_of_College_Graduates","317953471_Qualitative_Research_and_Case_Study_Applications_In_Education","316801566_Diversifying_Computer_Science_Departments_The_Role_of_Department_Chairs_in_Promoting_Gender_and_Racial_Diversity","316751736_Fashion_FUNdamentals_Building_Middle_School_Girls'_Self-Esteem_and_Interest_in_STEM"]}
