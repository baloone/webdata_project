{"id":"2237791_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora","abstract":"We describe a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text. Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text. We identify a set of lexicosyntactic patterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way. A subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested. 1 Introduction Currently there is much interest in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax and semantics, with the goal of building up large lexicons for natural language processing.
