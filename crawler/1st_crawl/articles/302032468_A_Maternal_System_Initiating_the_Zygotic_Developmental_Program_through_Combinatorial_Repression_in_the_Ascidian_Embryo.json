{"id":"302032468_A_Maternal_System_Initiating_the_Zygotic_Developmental_Program_through_Combinatorial_Repression_in_the_Ascidian_Embryo","abstract":"Author \nDuring animal development, transcription factors and signaling molecules transcriptionally regulate one another and constitute a gene regulatory network. This network is evoked by maternally provided factors. Many maternal factors are localized and thereby activate a set of genes in a specific region. In embryos of the chordate, Ciona intestinalis, three maternal factors with localized activities are known. The present study demonstrated that these localized maternal factors interact with one another through a fourth non-localized transcription factor, Tcf7, and negatively regulate one another. These repressive interactions are essential to establish the first distinct domains of gene expression and evoke the gene regulatory network properly. The findings indicate that not only activating target genes but also repressing activities of other transcription factors through protein-protein interactions are important to properly initiate the zygotic program. Intriguingly, in one repressive interaction, a transcription factor loses its binding activity for target sites through an interaction with another transcription factor. Thus, this study provides a description of the entire system in which maternal factors initiate the zygotic developmental program of the Ciona embryo.","authors":["Izuimi Oda","Atsushi Kubo","Willi Kari","Nobuhiro Suzuki"],"meta":["May 2016PLoS Genetics 12(5):e1006045","DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006045"],"references":["230803768_Cell_type-specific_binding_patterns_reveal_that_TCF7L2_can_be_tethered_to_the_genome_by_association_with_GATA3","51640037_Transcription_Factor_Zic2_Inhibits_Wnt_-Catenin_Protein_Signaling","278331679_Atypical_Transcriptional_Activation_by_TCF_via_a_Zic_Transcription_Factor_in_C_elegans_Neuronal_Precursors","272363301_Gene_regulatory_systems_that_control_gene_expression_in_the_Ciona_embryo","262226757_Induction_and_dorsal_restriction_of_Paired-box_3_Pax3_gene_expression_in_the_caudal_neuroectoderm_is_mediated_by_integration_of_multiple_pathways_on_a_short_neural_crest_enhancer","258312988_Transcriptional_regulation_in_the_early_ectodermal_lineage_of_ascidian_embryos","257753455_Transcriptome_dynamics_in_early_embryos_of_the_ascidian_Ciona_intestinalis","235775007_b-Catenin-Driven_Binary_Fate_Specification_Segregates_Germ_Layers_in_Ascidian_Embryos","230742429_Cis-Acting_Transcriptional_Repression_Establishes_a_Sharp_Boundary_in_Chordate_Embryos","51514762_A_Maternal_Factor_Unique_to_Ascidians_Silences_the_Germline_via_Binding_to_P-TEFb_and_RNAP_II_Regulation","51238692_Ci-Pem-1_localizes_to_the_nucleus_and_represses_somatic_gene_transcription_in_the_germline_of_Ciona_intestinalis_embryos","44888941_Temporal_regulation_of_the_muscle_gene_cascade_by_Macho1_and_Tbx6_transcription_factors_in_Ciona_intestinalis","47358335_The_Gap_Gene_Network","44640585_Simple_Combinations_of_Lineage-Determining_Factors_Prime_cis-Regulatory_Elements_Required_for_Macrophage_and_B-Cell_Identities","43147733_Genomic_cis-regulatory_networks_in_the_early_Ciona_intestinalis_embryo"]}
