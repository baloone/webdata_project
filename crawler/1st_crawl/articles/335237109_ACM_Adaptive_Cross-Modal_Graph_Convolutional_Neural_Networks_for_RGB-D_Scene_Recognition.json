{"id":"335237109_ACM_Adaptive_Cross-Modal_Graph_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_RGB-D_Scene_Recognition","abstract":"RGB image classification has achieved significant performance improvement with the resurge of deep convolutional neural networks. However, mono-modal deep models for RGB image still have several limitations when applied to RGB-D scene recognition. 1) Images for scene classification usually contain more than one typical object with flexible spatial distribution, so the object-level local features should also be considered in addition to global scene representation. 2) Multi-modal features in RGB-D scene classification are still under-utilized. Simply combining these modal-specific features suffers from the semantic gaps between different modalities. 3) Most existing methods neglect the complex relationships among multiple modality features. Considering these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive crossmodal (ACM) feature learning framework based on graph convolutional neural networks for RGB-D scene recognition. In order to make better use of the modal-specific cues, this approach mines the intra-modality relationships among the selected local features from one modality. To leverage the multi-modal knowledge more effectively, the proposed approach models the inter-modality relationships between two modalities through the cross-modal graph (CMG). We evaluate the proposed method on two public RGB-D scene classification datasets: SUN-RGBD and NYUD V2, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","authors":["Yuan Yuan","Zhitong Xiong","Qi Wang"],"meta":["July 2019Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 33:9176-9184","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019176"],"references":["322652865_Depth_CNNs_for_RGB-D_scene_recognition_learning_from_scratch_better_than_transferring_from_RGB-CNNs","320542470_RGB-D_Scene_Recognition_with_Object-to-Object_Relation","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","317501851_Combining_Models_from_Multiple_Sources_for_RGB-D_Scene_Recognition","311609698_Discriminative_Multi-modal_Feature_Fusion_for_RGBD_Indoor_Scene_Recognition","282182156_Understand_Scene_Categories_by_Objects_A_Semantic_Regularized_Scene_Classifier_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","281731445_MMSS_Multi-modal_Sharable_and_Specific_Feature_Learning_for_RGB-D_Object_Recognition","281073786_Large-margin_Multi-modal_Deep_Learning_for_RGB-D_Object_Recognition","279839496_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Scene_Recognition_using_Places_Database","278849222_Scene_Classification_with_Semantic_Fisher_Vectors","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","264160686_Learning_Rich_Features_from_RGB-D_Images_for_Object_Detection_and_Segmentation","234131118_Indoor_Semantic_Segmentation_using_depth_information","328176876_Detecting_Coherent_Groups_in_Crowd_Scenes_by_Multiview_Clustering","327459374_Scene_Classification_With_Recurrent_Attention_of_VHR_Remote_Sensing_Images","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318200394_Places_A_10_Million_Image_Database_for_Scene_Recognition","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308868622_Second-order_constrained_parametric_proposals_and_sequential_search-based_structured_prediction_for_semantic_segmentation_in_RGB-D_images","307991731_Semi-Supervised_Classification_with_Graph_Convolutional_Networks","307664547_SUN_RGB-D_A_RGB-D_scene_understanding_benchmark_suite","304641430_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_on_Graphs_with_Fast_Localized_Spectral_Filtering","299852654_Modality_and_Component_Aware_Feature_Fusion_for_RGB-D_Scene_Classification","276916013_Indoor_Scene_Understanding_with_RGB-D_Images_Bottom-up_Segmentation_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262222168_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","261227425_Perceptual_Organization_and_Recognition_of_Indoor_Scenes_from_RGB-D_Images","260642596_Multi-scale_Orderless_Pooling_of_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Features","222404885_Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Spectral_Graph_Theory","4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories"]}
