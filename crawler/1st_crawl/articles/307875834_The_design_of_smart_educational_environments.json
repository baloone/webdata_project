{"id":"307875834_The_design_of_smart_educational_environments","abstract":"This paper discusses the key characteristics of smart learning and the main challenges to be overcome when designing smart educational environments to support personalisation. In order to integrate smart learning environments into the learning ecosystem and educational contexts, innovative uses and new pedagogical approaches need to be implemented to orchestrate formal and informal learning.\nThis contribution describes the main characteristics of smart learning and smart learning environments and sustains the relevance of taking the participation of future users into account during the design process to increase knowledge of the design and the implementation of new pedagogical approaches in smart learning environments.","authors":["Bego√±a Gros"],"meta":["September 2016Smart Learning Environments 3(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40561-016-0039-x"],"references":["299520194_A_research_framework_of_smart_education","295186361_Evolution_Is_not_enough_Revolutionizing_Current_Learning_Environments_to_Smart_Learning_Environments","291187053_Exploring_the_behavioral_patterns_of_Co-regulation_in_mobile_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","286248373_Definition_framework_and_research_issues_of_smart_learning_environments_-_a_context-aware_ubiquitous_learning_perspective","281268835_The_Dialogue_Between_Emerging_Pedagogies_and_Emerging_Technologies","326576247_Ubiquitous_Learning_and_the_Future_of_Teaching","316790667_Social_Network_Informed_Design_for_Learning_with_Educational_Technology","303421550_Ubiquitous_learning_and_the_future_of_teaching","300020506_Smart_Learning_Analytics","276845467_Effects_of_Flipped_Classroom_based_on_Smart_Learning_on_Self-directed_and_Collaborative_Learning"]}
