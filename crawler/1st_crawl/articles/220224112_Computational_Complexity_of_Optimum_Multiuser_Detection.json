{"id":"220224112_Computational_Complexity_of_Optimum_Multiuser_Detection","abstract":"Optimum centralized demodulation of the independent data streams transmitted simultaneously by several users through a Code\nDivision Multiple-Access channel is considered. Each user sends an arbitrary assigned signal waveform, which is linearly modulated\nby symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. If the users are asynchronous, the optimum multiuser detector can be implemented\nby a Viterbi algorithm whose time-complexity is linear in the number of symbols transmitted by each user and exponential in\nthe number of users. It is shown that the combinatorial problem of selecting the most likely transmitted data stream given\nthe sufficient statistics (sequence of matched filter outputs), and the signal energies and cross-correlations is nondeterministic\npolynomial-time hard (NP-hard) in the number of users. And it remains so even if the users are restricted to be symbol-synchronous.\n\nThe performance analysis of optimum multiuser detection in terms of the set of multiuser asymptotic efficiencies is equivalent\nto the computation of the minimum Euclidean distance between any pair of distinct multiuser signals. This problem is also\nshown to be NP-hard and a conjecture on a longstanding open problem in single user data communication theory is presented.","authors":["Sergio Verd√∫"],"meta":["June 1989Algorithmica 4(3):303-312","DOI:10.1007/BF01553893","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220695898_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Complexity","3004932_Optimum_Detection_of_Code_Division_Multiplexed_Signals","265812920_Advanced_data-transmission_systems","236157558_The_Viterbi_algorithm","235890211_The_Viterbi_algorithm","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","224733918_Optimum_Multiuser_Asymptotic_Efficiency","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220682144_Multiple-access_channels_with_point-process_observations_Optimum_demodulation","33800384_Optimum_multi-user_signal_detection","3084266_Minimum_Probability_of_Error_for_Asynchronous_Gaussian_Multiple-Access_Channels","3084101_Optimum_multiuser_signal_detection_PhD_Abstr","3083010_Computational_savings_and_implementation_of_maximum_likelihood_detectors_Corresp","3082939_A_Reduced_State_Variant_of_Maximum_Likelihood_Sequence_Detection_Attaining_Optimum_Performance_for_High_Signal-to-Noise_Ratios","3077444_Linear_Multiuser_Detectors_for_Synchronous_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Channels","2993374_The_Viterbi_algorithm"]}
