{"id":"222449874_PRESTA_The_parameter_reduced_electron-step_transport_algorithm_for_electron_Monte_Carlo_transport","abstract":"A new electron transport algorithm for use with electron Monte Carlo transport codes is presented. Its components are: a path-length correction (PLC) algorithm which is based on the multiple scattering theory of Moli√®re and which takes into account the differences between the straight path length and the total curved path length for each electron step; a lateral correlation algorithm (LCA) which takes into account lateral transport; and a boundary crossing algorithm (BCA) which ensures that electrons are transported accurately in the vicinity of interfaces. The algorithm has been implemented in the EGS4 code system and a variety of tests validating the algorithms are presented. In its standard configuration, use of this algorithm will allow the inexperienced user to obtain reliable results from the EGS Monte Carlo code without having to do a detailed study of the electron transport parameters. In many situations, substantial savings in computing time may be realized in comparison to the present EGS algorithm. The developments described in this report may be adapted to other electron transport codes where many of the same conclusions may be drawn.","authors":["Alex F Bielajew","D.W.O.
