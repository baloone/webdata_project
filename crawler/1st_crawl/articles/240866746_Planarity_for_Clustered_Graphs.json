{"id":"240866746_Planarity_for_Clustered_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new graph model known as clustered graphs, i.e. graphs with recursive clustering structures. This graph model has many applications in informational and mathematical sciences. In particular, we study C-planarity of clustered graphs. Given a clustered graph, the C-planarity testing problem is to determine whether the clustered graph can be drawn without edge crossings, or edge-region crossings. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for testing C-planarity and finding C-planar embeddings of clustered graphs.","authors":["Qing-wen Feng","Robert F.
