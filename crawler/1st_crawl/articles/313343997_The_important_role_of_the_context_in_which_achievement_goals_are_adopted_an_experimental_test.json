{"id":"313343997_The_important_role_of_the_context_in_which_achievement_goals_are_adopted_an_experimental_test","abstract":"Two experimental studies using Elliot, Murayama, and Pekrun’s (Journal of Educational Psychology 103(3):632–648, 2011) differentiation between self-goals and task-goals, were conducted to examine the relative influence of achievement goals and motivational contexts on behavioral and emotional engagement. In Study 1, 133 college students were prompted to adopt self-goals (intrapersonal standards) or other-goals (performance standards) in one of two motivational contexts (autonomy-supportive or autonomy-suppressive) while playing a computer game. In Study 2, 129 college students performed the same assignment, this time adopting either other-goals or task-goals (absolute standards). Study 1 indicated that autonomy-support facilitated behavioral and emotional engagement in autonomy suppressive contexts, but self-goals merely promoted emotional engagement relative to other-goals. Study 2 replicated Study 1’s findings by showing that autonomy support promoted self-reported behavioral engagement and task-goals promoted emotional engagement but further revealed that only when task-goals were adopted in an autonomy-supportive context did they promote better behavioral engagement than other-goals. Thus, Study 2 highlighted the importance of the context in which the achievement goals were adopted (i.e., autonomy-supportive versus suppressive) as an important determinant of the outcome.","authors":["Moti Benita","Noa Shane","Orit Elgali","Guy Roth"],"meta":["April 2017Motivation and Emotion 41(2):1-16","DOI:10.1007/s11031-016-9600-8"],"references":["313068018_Achievement_goals_and_goal_structures","305310448_Intrapersonal_Achievement_Goals_and_Underlying_Reasons_among_Long_Distance_Runners_Their_Relation_with_Race_Experience_Self-Talk_and_Running_Time","305310257_Achievement_Goals_and_their_Underlying_Goal_Motivation_Does_it_Matter_Why_Sport_Participants_Pursue_their_Goals","305310255_Building_on_the_Enriched_Hierarchical_Model_of_Achievement_Motivation_Autonomous_and_Controlling_Reasons_Underlying_Mastery_Goals","301325937_Internalization_within_the_family_The_self-determination_theory_perspective","277625472_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Impact_of_Situationally_Induced_Achievement_Goals_on_Task_Performance","313647035_Achievement_goal_theory_Past_results_future_directions","304262959_Test_anxiety_and_the_hierarchical_model_of_approach_and_avoidance_achievement_motivation","287483691_Autonomous_and_controlled_reasons_underlying_achievement_goals_Implications_for_the_3_2_achievement_goal_model_in_educational_and_work_settings","279251933_Achievement_Goals_Emotions_Learning_and_Performance_A_Process_Model","264089453_Moving_the_Achievement_Goal_Approach_One_Step_Forward_Toward_a_Systematic_Examination_of_the_Autonomous_and_Controlled_Reasons_Underlying_Achievement_Goals","263916494_Approach_and_Avoidance_Achievement_Goals_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_A_Mediational_Analysis","262917073_When_Are_Mastery_Goals_More_Adaptive_It_Depends_on_Experiences_of_Autonomy_Support_and_Autonomy","261256624_Examining_Correlates_of_Game-to-Game_Variation_in_Volleyball_Players'_Achievement_Goal_Pursuit_and_Underlying_Autonomous_and_Controlling_Reasons","265971969_Enriching_the_hierarchical_model_of_achievement_motivation_Autonomous_and_controlling_reasons_underlying_achievement_goals"]}
