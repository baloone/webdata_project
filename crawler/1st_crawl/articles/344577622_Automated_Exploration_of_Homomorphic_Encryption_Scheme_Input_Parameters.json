{"id":"344577622_Automated_Exploration_of_Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme_Input_Parameters","abstract":"Homomorphic Encryption (HE) aims to perform computations on encrypted data. Still in research stage, a lot of HE schemes have been created but their comparison remains costly as execution exhibits prohibitive costs. PAnTHErS is a HE schemes modeler. Modeling with a common formalism allows the evaluation of input parameters variation impact on performances of a HE scheme execution i.e. on its execution time and its memory cost. However, choosing a values interval that makes sense during the exploration phase still requires high expertise. This may prevent the tool from a large adoption by novice users. In this paper, we remind functionalities of PAnTHErS and present an automated exploration method. This exploration method will offer designers a simplified access to PAnTHErS functionalities.","authors":["Cyrielle Feron","Vianney Lapotre","Lo√Øc Lagadec"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Information Security and Applications 55(11)","DOI:10.1016/j.jisa.2020.102627"],"references":["322841075_Stream_Ciphers_A_Practical_Solution_for_Efficient_Homomorphic-Ciphertext_Compression","299365697_Flattening_NTRU_for_Evaluation_Key_Free_Homomorphic_Encryption","324177484_Fast_Evaluation_of_Homomorphic_Encryption_Schemes_Based_on_Ring-LWE","318926507_PAnTHErS_A_Prototyping_and_Analysis_Tool_for_Homomorphic_Encryption_Schemes","314703515_NFLlib_NTT-Based_Fast_Lattice_Library","312572347_Practical_Privacy-Preserving_Medical_Diagnosis_Using_Homomorphic_Encryption","311918065_HardwareSoftware_Co-Design_of_an_Accelerator_for_FV_Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme_Using_Karatsuba_Algorithm","305472502_A_Subfield_Lattice_Attack_on_Overstretched_NTRU_Assumptions","267862690_Somewhat_Practical_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based"]}
