{"id":"283255287_Review_of_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"Over many centuries, tools of increasing sophistication have been developed to serve the human race Digital computers are, in many respects, just another tool. They can perform the same sort of numerical and symbolic manipulations that an ordinary person can, but faster and more reliably. This paper represents review of artificial intelligence algorithms applying in computer application and software. Include knowledge-based systems; computational intelligence, which leads to Artificial intelligence, is the science of mimicking human mental faculties in a computer. That assists Physician to make dissection in medical diagnosis.","authors":["Jameela Alkrimi","Abdul Rahim Ahmad","Loay E.
