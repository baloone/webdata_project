{"id":"220931823_Biometric_Personal_Identification_Based_on_Iris_Patterns","abstract":"A new system for personal identification based on iris patterns is presented in this paper. It is composed of iris image acquisition, image preprocessing, feature extraction and classifier design. The algorithm for iris feature extraction is based on texture analysis using multi-channel Gabor filtering and wavelet transform. Compared with existing methods, our method employs the rich 2-D information of the iris and is translation, rotation, and scale invariant.","authors":["Yong Zhu","Tieniu Tan","Yunhong Wang"],"meta":["January 2000Zidonghua Xuebao/Acta Automatica Sinica 2(1):2801-2804","DOI:10.1109/ICPR.2000.906197","SourceDBLP","Conference: 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition"],"references":["221280849_Texture_Classification_by_Wavelet_Packet_Signatures","3316773_A_Human_Identification_Technique_Using_Images_of_the_Iris_and_Wavelet_Transform","3192192_Texture_Classification_by_Wavelet_Packet_Signatures","313715769_Biometric_personal_identification_based_on_iris_patterns","252955114_Recognizing_human_eyes","3513908_Texture_feature_extraction_via_visual_cortical_channel_modelling","3192194_High_confidence_visual_recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_statistical_independence","2985219_Iris_recognition_An_emerging_biometrie_technology"]}
