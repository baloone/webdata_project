{"id":"311425838_The_Complexity_of_Cities_and_the_Problem_of_Urban_Design","abstract":"Seen from the distance of half a century Christopher Alexander’s “A city is not a tree” (1) remains a landmark in our thinking about cities and design. Superficially, its main achievement was to produce a systematic argument about what the city is not. In many ways this was a product of its time, a reaction against the modernist view of the “city as a machine”(3, 4). The logic and conceptual clarity of Alexander’s argument and its lucid use of mathematical concepts in complex but real circumstances wins the day any day against the then prevailing forces in architecture, who saw the problem of the city as a technical issue of design to produce health, efficiency and order. But the article is much more than that. It is a new beginning: The first step on a journey – for Alexander and for urbanism - to discover what the city really is.","authors":["Luís M A Bettencourt"],"meta":["January 2016","In book: A City is Not a Tree: 50th Anniversary Edition (pp.47-61)Edition: 1st editionChapter: 3Publisher: Sustasis PressEditors: Michael Mehaffy"],"references":["304380719_Settlement_scaling_and_increasing_returns_in_an_ancient_society","281732021_Impact_of_Changing_Technology_on_the_Evolution_of_Complex_Informational_Networks","260213653_The_Pre-History_of_Urban_Scaling","305553916_The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities","303131868_A_city_is_not_a_tree","286254181_Triumph_of_the_City_How_Our_Greatest_Invention_Makes_Us_Richer_Smarter_Greener_Healthier_and_Happier_an_excerpttranslated_by_Inna_Kushnareva","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","274469811_Towards_a_New_Architecture","273059432_Triumph_of_the_City_How_Our_Greatest_Invention_Makes_Us_Richer_Smarter_Greener_Healthier_and_Hap_pier","270385877_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form"]}
