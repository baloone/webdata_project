{"id":"247035895_On_the_distance_of_the_composition_of_two_derivations_to_the_generalized_derivations","abstract":"A well-known theorem of E. Posner [10] states that if the composition d 1 d 2 of derivations d 1 d 2 of a prime ring A of characteristic not 2 is a derivation, then either d 1 = 0 or d 2 = 0. A number of authors have generalized this theorem in several ways (see e.g. [1], [2], and [5], where further references can be found). Under stronger assumptions when A is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Banach space (resp. Hilbert space), Posner's theorem was reproved in [3] (resp. [12]). Recently, M. Mathieu [8] extended Posner's theorem to arbitrary C * -algebras.","authors":["Matej Bresar"],"meta":["January 1991Glasgow Mathematical Journal 33(01)","DOI:10.1017/S0017089500008077"],"references":["248668772_Properties_of_the_Product_of_Two_Derivations_of_a_C_-Algebra","243031792_Elementary_operators_on_prime_C-algebras_II","268646169_The_Norm_of_a_Derivation_in_a_W_-Algebra","268491961_Orthogonal_derivation_and_an_extension_of_a_theorem_of_Posner","266436937_Applications_of_ultraprime_Banach_algebras_in_the_theory_of_elementary_operators","265948753_On_the_operator_identity_SA_k_XB_k_O","265590430_Derivations_in_Prime_Rings","265461878_Differential_identities_Lie_ideals_and_Posner's_theorems","246686046_Lie_ideals_and_derivations_of_prime_rings","243077159_Norm_of_a_Derivation_on_a_Von_Neumann_Algebra","238383626_Rings_of_quotients_of_ultraprime_Banach_algebras_with_applications_to_elementary_operators","226412471_Elementary_operators_on_primeC-algebras_I","38345516_On_the_range_of_a_derivation"]}
