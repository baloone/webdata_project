{"id":"236173541_Framework_for_a_global_quality_evaluation_of_a_website","abstract":"Purpose\n– This paper aims to propose a high‐level structure for a global quality evaluation of a website. This structure is based on the characteristics, sub‐characteristics and attributes of three main dimensions (content, service, and technical quality) that will substantiate the development of broad website quality evaluation, comparison and improvement methodologies, according to particular sectors of activity and evaluator's perspective.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– Based on the literature and the author's experience a framework is proposed for a global quality evaluation of a website.\n\nFindings\n– Considering the results of some studies, as well as the systematisation of the knowledge available in several bibliographies, website quality can be grouped into three main dimensions: content quality, service quality, and technical quality. There has not yet been an evaluation methodology that focuses on these three main website quality dimensions in a broad and transversal sense.\n\nOriginality/value\n– The paper presents an innovative high‐level structure for a global quality evaluation of a website, based on three dimensions not previously considered together.","authors":["Álvaro Rocha"],"meta":["March 2012Online Information Review 36(3)","DOI:10.1108/14684521211241404"],"references":["278017275_Avaliacao_da_Qualidade_de_Sitios_Web_Institucionais_-_Aplicacao_de_Metrica_as_Faculdades_de_Medicina_do_Espaco_Iberico","266863185_E-Service_Quality_Ease_of_Use_Usability_and_Enjoyment_as_Antecedents_of_E-CRM_Performance_An_Empirical_Investigation_in_Jordan_Mobile_Phone_Services","258158801_E-S-Qual_A_Multiple-Item_Scale_for_Assessing_Electronic_Service_Quality","247836126_Real_options_in_service_investments_scenarios_from_defence","228847297_Medicao_da_Qualidade_de_Aplicacoes_Web_na_Fase_de_Requisitos","228415543_Empirical_Study_on_Electronic_Service_Quality","222700541_The_assessment_of_user-perceived_web_quality_Application_of_a_satisfaction_benchmarking_approach","242024569_Software_Quality_Assurance","236157123_ISO_924111_Ergonomic_Requirements_for_Office_Work_with_Visual_Display_Terminals_VDTs_-_Part_11_Guidance_on_Usability","228938988_DETERMINATION_OF_USERS_SATISFACTION_LEVEL_REGARDING_THE_QUALITY_OF_E-SERVICES_PROVIDED_BY_BOGDAN-VODA_UNIVERSITY"]}
