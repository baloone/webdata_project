{"id":"322160101_Pilot-assisted_intradyne_reception_for_high-speed_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_true_local_oscillator","abstract":"We present a pilot-assisted coherent intradyne reception methodology for CV-QKD with true local oscillator. An optically phase-locked reference tone, prepared using carrier-suppressed optical single-sideband modulation, is multiplexed in polarisation and frequency to the 250 Mbaud quantum signal in order to provide optical frequency- and phase matching between quantum signal and local oscillator. Our concept allows for high symbol rates and can be operated at an extremely low excess-noise level, as validated by experimental measurements.","authors":["Fabian Laudenbach","Bernhard Schrenk","Christoph Pacher","Michael Hentschel"],"meta":["December 2017Quantum 3","DOI:10.22331/q-2019-10-07-193","Project: Quantum Key Distribution Systems"],"references":["320252096_A_flexible_continuous-variable_QKD_system_using_off-the-shelf_components","319566672_A_low-complexity_heterodyne_CV-QKD_architecture","315682295_Continuous-Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_Gaussian_Modulation_--_The_Theory_of_Practical_Implementations","281056131_High-speed_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_without_sending_a_local_oscillator","324934115_High-Rate_Continuous-Variables_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_Piloted-Disciplined_Local_Oscillator","322706277_High_key_rate_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_a_real_local_oscillator","322450973_Pilot-multiplexed_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_a_real_local_oscillator","316018955_Continuous_variable_quantum_key_distribution_with_a_real_local_oscillator_using_simultaneous_pilot_signals","303011140_Self-coherent_phase_reference_sharing_for_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution","282006897_Simple_and_Efficient_Detection_Scheme_for_Continuous_Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_with_m-ary_Phase-Shift-Keying"]}
