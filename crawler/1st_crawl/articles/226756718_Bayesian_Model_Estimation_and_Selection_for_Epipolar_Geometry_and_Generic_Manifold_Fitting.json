{"id":"226756718_Bayesian_Model_Estimation_and_Selection_for_Epipolar_Geometry_and_Generic_Manifold_Fitting","abstract":"Computer vision often involves estimating models from visual input. Sometimes it is possible to fit several different models or hypotheses to a set of data, and a decision must be made as to which is most appropriate. This paper explores ways of automating the model selection process with specific emphasis on the least squares problem of fitting manifolds (in particular algebraic varieties e.g. lines, algebraic curves, planes etc.) to data points, illustrated with respect to epipolar geometry. The approach is Bayesian and the contribution three fold, first a new Bayesian description of the problem is laid out that supersedes the author's previous maximum likelihood formulations, this formulation will reveal some hidden elements of the problem. Second an algorithm, MAPSAC, is provided to obtain the robust MAP estimate of an arbitrary manifold. Third, a Bayesian model selection paradigm is proposed, the Bayesian formulation of the manifoldfitting problem uncovers an elegant solution to this problem, for which a new method GRIC for approximating the posterior probability of each putative model is derived. This approximations bears some similarity to the penalized likelihoods used by AIC, BIC and MDL however it is far more accurate in situations involving large numbers of latent variables whose number increases with the data. This will be empirically and theoretically demonstrated.","authors":["Philip Hilaire Torr"],"meta":["October 2002International Journal of Computer Vision 50(1):35-61","DOI:10.1023/A:1020224303087","SourceDBLP"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","233494305_Efficient_Approximations_for_the_Marginal_Likelihood_of_Bayesian_Networks_with_Hidden_Variables","229100226_Mixture_Models_Inference_and_Applications_to_Clustering","227004520_Murray_DW_The_Development_and_Comparison_of_Robust_Methods_for_Estimating_the_Fundamental_Matrix_International_Journal_of_Computer_Vision_24_271-300","226173387_Determining_the_Epipolar_Geometry_and_its_Uncertainty_A_Review","313178107_Theoria_combinationis_observationum_erroribus_minimis_obnoxiae","312613930_Spatia1_interaction_and_statistical_analysis_o1_lattice_systems","312536344_Triangulation","305302044_Bayes_factors","285443873_An_Asymptotic_Equivalence_of_Choice_of_Model_by_Cross-Validation_and_Akaike's_Criterion","284519481_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics_Vol_2","275778322_Theory_of_Probability","274882945_Subset_Selection_in_Regression","274410515_Mixture_Models_Inference_and_Applications_to_Clustering","274364057_Non-Linear_Regression","274180196_The_Algebra_of_Probable_Inference","273134799_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model","271205402_Bayes_Factor","271196714_New_Look_at_Statistical-Model_Identification","270366641_An_Introduction_to_Baysian_Inference_in_Econometric","269079084_Robust_Vision","268465413_MDL_Collineations_and_the_Fundamental_Matrix","265619863_Subset_Selection_in_Regression","261793645_Selection_of_Subsets_of_Regression_Variables","259864433_Pattern_Recognition_And_Neural_Networks","257925521_An_asymptotic_equivalence_of_choice_of_model_by_cross-validation_and_Akaike's_Criterion","255563931_An_Information_Measure_for_Classification''Computer_Journal","255563893_Model_Selection_for_Structure_and_Motion_Recovery_from_Multiple_Images","247748318_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics_2","247234723_Prequential_analysis_stochastic_complexity_and_Bayesian_inference","246845334_Model_Selection_and_Validation_Methods_for_Non-linear_Systems","245658657_Choosing_Subset_Regression","243782463_Probability_Frequency_and_Reasonable_Expectation","243767425_Visual_tracking_by_stochastic_propagation_of_conditional_density","243765427_A_Pattern_Theoretical_Study_of_Biological_Shapes","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","243678656_An_Alternative_to_the_Rejection_of_Observations","243573429_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","243486389_The_Algebra_of_Probable_Inference","242706958_Spatial_interaction_and_statistical_analysis_of_lattice_systems","242376908_An_Introduction_to_The_Bootstrap","239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images","239550461_Theoria_Combinationis_Observationum_Erroribus_Minimis_Obnoxiae_Pars_Posterior","236645696_A_New_Look_at_the_Statistical_Model_Identification","234827710_Geometry_computation_for_machine_vision","234817037_Geometric_Invariance_in_Computer_Vision","234806928_Hands_A_pattern_theoretic_study_of_biological_shapes","234787139_Statistical_Optimization_for_Geometric_Computation_Theory_and_Practice","226715105_The_Problem_of_Degeneracy_in_Structure_and_Motion_Recovery_from_Uncalibrated_Image_Sequences","224839810_An_Introduction_to_the_Boot-Strap","223860268_On_model_selection_in_the_computer_age","223701246_Structure-from-motion_under_orthographic_projection","223374457_Robust_Detection_of_Degenerate_Configurations_while_Estimating_the_Fundamental_Matrix","222812561_Modeling_by_shortest_data_description","222564722_MLESAC_A_New_Robust_Estimator_with_Application_to_Estimating_Image_Geometry"]}
