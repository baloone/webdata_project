{"id":"321986530_An_Interactive_Workflow_Generator_to_Support_Bioinformatics_Analysis_Through_GPU_Acceleration","abstract":"Next Generation Sequencing has introduced novel means of sequencing millions of DNA molecules simultaneously and has opened up new avenues in the field of bioinformatics that requires high performance computing technologies. Bioinformatics pipelines are constructed to carry out bioinformatics analyses\nin a fast and efficient manner. Workflow systems are developed to simplify the construction of pipelines and automate analyses. Still, with the availability of large amounts of sequence data, it has become challenging to have results within a reasonable amount of time. The research proposes a GPU accelerated generic software system to construct bioinformatics workflows. The system allows performing analyses through dedicated GPU computing resources, while incorporating novel web technologies to support specific requirements of bioinformatics software. The results indicate a speedup of x3.11 when a workflow is run on the GPU accelerated system than on a CPU. System usability scale score of 77.5 suggests good usability for the system.","authors":["Anuradha Welivita","Indika Perera","Dulani Meedeniya"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217691","Conference: The 11th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM) 2017At: Kansas City, MO, USA","Projects: Bio-Health InformaticsA generic software system to support Bioinformatics analyses"],"references":["312489586_The_taverna_workflow_suite_Designing_and_executing_workflows_of_web_services_on_the_desktop_web_or_in_the_cloud","309400305_A_GPU-based_high_performance_computing_infrastructure_for_specialized_NGS_analyses","299414079_A_review_of_bioinformatic_pipeline_frameworks","296329624_blastjs_a_BLAST_wrapper_for_Nodejs","281081296_Experiences_with_workflows_for_automating_data-intensive_bioinformatics","236941216_Exploiting_GPUs_in_Virtual_Machine_for_BioCloud","311570050_Galaxy_A_comprehensive_approach_for_supporting_accessible_reproducible_and_transparent_computational_research_in_the_life_sciences","262350563_Makeflow_A_portable_abstraction_for_data_intensive_computing_on_clusters_clouds_and_grids","243475765_Concurrent_make_the_design_and_implementation_of_a_distributed_program_in_concurrent_c","230717087_Snakemake_-_A_scalable_bioinformatics_workflow_engine"]}
