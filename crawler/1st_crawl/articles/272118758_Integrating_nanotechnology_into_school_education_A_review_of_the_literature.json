{"id":"272118758_Integrating_nanotechnology_into_school_education_A_review_of_the_literature","abstract":"Background : In this era of rapid technical advancement, there are growing debates around the idea of nanotechnology, which are both timely and controversial. Nanotechnology materials are being utilized in our daily lives in many ways, often without consumer knowledge. Due to the explosion of nanotechnology applications, there is a necessity to update school science curricula by integrating nanotechnology-related concepts that are both relevant and meaningful to students. The integration of nanotechnology in school science curricula comes in response to nanoscientific development and our mission as educators to instill and arouse studentsâ€™ curiosity in learning about both what is and what will be more dominantly occupying the marketplace.","authors":["Nadira I.
