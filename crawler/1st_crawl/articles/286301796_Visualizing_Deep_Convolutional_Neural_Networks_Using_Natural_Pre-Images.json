{"id":"286301796_Visualizing_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Using_Natural_Pre-Images","abstract":"Image representations, from SIFT and bag of visual words to Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs), are a crucial component of almost all computer vision\nsystems. However, our understanding of them remains limited. In this paper we\nstudy several landmark representations, both shallow and deep, by a number of\ncomplementary visualization techniques. These visualizations are based on the\nconcept of \"natural pre-image\", namely a naturally-looking image whose\nrepresentation has some notable property. We study in particular three such\nvisualizations: inversion, in which the aim is to reconstruct an image from its\nrepresentation, activation maximization, in which we search for patterns that\nmaximally stimulate a representation component, and caricaturization, in which\nthe visual patterns that a representation detects in an image are exaggerated.\nWe pose this as a regularized energy-minimization framework and demonstrate its\ngenerality and effectiveness. In particular, we show that this method can\ninvert representations such as HOG more accurately than recent alternatives\nwhile being applicable to CNNs too. Among our findings, we show that several\nlayers in CNNs retain photographically accurate information about the image,\nwith different degrees of geometric and photometric invariance.","authors":["Aravindh Mahendran","Andrea Vedaldi"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Computer Vision 120(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11263-016-0911-8","SourcearXiv","Project: Visualizing Deep Image Representations Using Natural Pre-Images"],"references":["307560165_Deep_neural_networks_are_easily_fooled_High_confidence_predictions_for_unrecognizable_images","283725380_Image_Reconstruction_from_Bag-of-Visual-Words","281312423_A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style","279839496_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Scene_Recognition_using_Places_Database","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770151_Beyond_bits_Reconstructing_images_from_Local_Binary_Descriptors","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","307822569_Understanding_deep_image_representations_by_inverting_them","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","279068412_Understanding_Neural_Networks_Through_Deep_Visualization","277334140_Texture_synthesis_and_the_controlled_generation_of_natural_stimuli_using_convolutional_neural_networks","277023437_Image_Reconstruction_from_Bag-of-Visual-Words","278048846_Inverting_Convolutional_Networks_with_Convolutional_Networks","274202844_Neural_Networks_for_Pattern_Recognition"]}
