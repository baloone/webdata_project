{"id":"228811812_3-subdivision","abstract":"A new stationary subdivision scheme is presented which performs slower topological refinement than the usual dyadic split operation. The number of triangles increases in every step by a factor of 3 instead of 4. Applying the subdivision operator twice causes a uni-form refinement with tri-section of every original edge (hence the name Â¢ 3-subdivision) while two dyadic splits would quad-sect ev-ery original edge. Besides the finer gradation of the hierarchy lev-els, the new scheme has several important properties: The stencils for the subdivision rules have minimum size and maximum symme-try. The smoothness of the limit surface is C 2 everywhere except for the extraordinary points where it is C 1 . The convergence analysis of the scheme is presented based on a new general technique which also applies to the analysis of other subdivision schemes. The new splitting operation enables locally adaptive refinement under built-in preservation of the mesh consistency without temporary crack-fixing between neighboring faces from different refinement levels. The size of the surrounding mesh area which is affected by selec-tive refinement is smaller than for the dyadic split operation. We further present a simple extension of the new subdivision scheme which makes it applicable to meshes with boundary and allows us to generate sharp feature lines.","authors":["Leif Kobbelt"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1145/344779.344835","SourceDBLP"],"references":["202232980_A_Butterfly_Subdivision_Scheme_for_Surface_Interpolation_with_Tension_Control","2376828_Exact_Evaluation_Of_Catmull-Clark_Subdivision_Surfaces_At_Arbitrary_Parameter_Values","312577585_Stationary_subdivision_Mem","256152244_Clark_J_Recursively_generated_b-spline_surfaces_on_arbitrary_topological_meshes_Computer-Aided_Design_106_350-355","240448668_Piecewise_Smooth_Subdivision_with_Normal_Control","226516643_Multilevel_Gauss-Seidel-algorithms_for_full_and_sparse_grid_problems","223851936_A_Unified_approach_to_subdivision_algorithms_near_extraordinary_vertices","222448665_Behavior_of_recursive_division_surfaces_near_extraordinary_points","220721630_Multiresolution_Signal_Processing_for_Meshes","220720982_Interpolating_Nets_of_Curves_by_Smooth_Subdivision_Surfaces","220720615_Interactive_Multiresolution_Mesh_Editing","220720434_Piecewise_Smooth_Surface_Reconstruction","220694507_A_Review_of_A_Posteriori_Error_Estimation_and_Adaptive_Mesh-Refinement_Techniques","220391073_Smoothness_of_subdivision_surfaces_at_extraordinary_points","220184353_The_Simplest_Subdivision_Scheme_for_Smoothing_Polyhedra","34370377_Smooth_Subdivision_Surfaces_Based_on_Triangles","3873815_Semi-regular_4-8_refinement_and_box_spline_surfaces","3513152_Adaptive_meshes_and_shells_irregular_triangulation_discontinuities_and_hierarchical_subdivision","2867302_Interactive_Multi-Resolution_Modeling_on_Arbitrary_Meshes","2773077_C_k_Continuity_of_Subdivision_Surfaces","2612754_Interpolatory_Subdivision_on_Open_Quadrilateral_Nets_with_Arbitrary_Topology","2578032_Multivariate_Subdivision_Schemes_And_Divided_Differences","2453662_Interpolating_Subdivision_for_Meshes_with_Arbitrary_Topology","2395649_Subdivision_Methods_for_Geometric_Design","2375745_Ray_Tracing_of_Subdivision_Surfaces"]}
