{"id":"228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","abstract":"Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts\nacross many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure,\ninfer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and\nnatural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in\na communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT),\nwherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us,\nand the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common\noperating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of\nenabling device technologies such as RFID tags and readers, near field\ncommunication (NFC) devices and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has\nstepped out of its infancy and is the the next revolutionary technology in\ntransforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move\nfrom www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous\ncomputing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive\nqueries increases significantly. This paper presents a cloud centric vision for\nworldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies\nand application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near\nfuture are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on\ninteraction of private and public clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT\nvision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and\ndistributed computing directed at technological research community.","authors":["Jayavardhana Gubbi","Rajkumar Buyya","Slaven Marusic","Marimuthu Palaniswami"],"meta":["July 2012Future Generation Computer Systems 29(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2013.01.010","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266895592_GBROOS_-_An_Ocean_Observing_System_for_the_Great_Barrier_Reef","262320674_N-smarts_networked_suite_of_mobile_atmospheric_real-time_sensors","257728151_A_Crop_Monitoring_System_Based_on_Wireless_Sensor_Network","242505367_Data_Visualization_The_State_of_the_Art","237632154_A_review_of_travel-time_prediction_in_transport_and_logistics","237291513_Sensor_Web_Integration_of_Sensor_Sensor_Web_Integration_of_Sensor_Sensor_Web_Integration_of_Sensor_Sensor_Web_Integration_of_Sensor_Networks_with_Web_and_Cyber_Networks_with_Web_and_Cyber_Networks_wit","228689203_People-centric_Urban_Sensing","228664767_Vision_and_Challenges_for_Realizing_the_Internet_of_Things","228350909_First_experiences_using_wireless_sensor_networks_for_noise_pollution_monitoring","227912248_Item-level_RFID_in_the_retail_supply_chain","225738726_Security_Challenges_in_the_IP-Based_Internet_of_Things","224600186_Bayesian_compressive_sensing_of_wavelet_coefficients_using_multiscale_Laplacian_priors","224142135_Computational_Intelligence_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","221932962_MAC_protocols_for_wireless_sensor_networks_A_survey","221635453_Smart_Cities_at_the_Forefront_of_the_Future_Internet","221396695_Secure_Data_Aggregation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","221284402_Compressive_wireless_sensing","221284215_Ear-phone_An_end-to-end_participatory_urban_noise_mapping_system","221036920_Architecture_and_protocols_for_the_Internet_of_Things_A_case_study","220696492_The_Aware_Home_A_Living_Laboratory_for_Ubiquitous_Computing_Research","220491250_Building_the_internet_of_things_using_RFID_The_RFID_ecosystem_experience","220411099_A_Taxonomy_of_Wireless_Micro-Sensor_Network_Models","313310002_People-Centric_Urban_sensing","301888287_That_'Internet_of_Things'_Thing","292020949_Data_security_in_the_world_of_cloud_computing","288823608_The_Internet_of_things_From_RFID_to_the_next-generation_pervasive_networked_systems","265108918_Gartner's_Hype_Cycle_Special_Report_for_2009","260634899_Data_Security_in_the_World_of_Cloud_Computing","258476881_Smart_Transport_System_Based_on_The_Internet_of_Things''","251194224_Adding_sense_to_the_Internet_of_Things","232621150_Smart_Home_Mobile_RFID-Based_Internet-of-Things_Systems_and_Services","224265882_Smart_Community_An_Internet_of_Things_Application","224169839_Research_on_the_architecture_and_key_technology_of_Internet_of_Things_IoT_applied_on_smart_grid","224101940_Origins_of_ubiquitous_computing_research_at_PARC_in_the_late_1980s","223906243_DaisyViz_A_model-based_user_interface_toolkit_for_interactive_information_visualization_systems","223629584_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Healthcare_A_Survey","222563248_A_Survey_on_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks","222513995_Coverage_and_Connectivity_Issues_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility","221568533_Moving_on_from_Weiser's_Vision_of_Calm_Computing_Engaging_UbiComp_Experiences","221441575_Participatory_Sensing_in_Public_Spaces_Activating_Urban_Surfaces_with_Sensor_Probes","221010324_People_with_Disabilities_Assistive_Homes_and_Environments","220682213_Compressed_sensing","220545643_Quality_of_service_models_for_heterogeneous_networks_Overview_and_challenges","220475753_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things","220303334_Future_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Like_Mankind_Neural_System_or_Social_Organization_Framework","220303131_SIoT_Giving_a_Social_Structure_to_the_Internet_of_Things","220300014_Friday_A_Ubicomp_systems_at_20_Progress_opportunities_and_challenges_IEEE_Pervasive_Computing_111_14-21","220200766_A_remote_markerless_human_gait_tracking_for_e-healthcare_based_on_content-aware_wireless_multimedia_communications","220144384_A_Survey_on_Facilities_for_Experimental_Internet_of_Things_Research","220141406_Adding_sense_to_the_Internet_of_Things_-_An_architecture_framework_for_Smart_Object_systems","220285421_Deadline-driven_provisioning_of_resources_for_scientific_applications_in_hybrid_clouds_with_Aneka","220200776_From_today's_INTRAnet_of_things_to_a_future_INTERnet_of_things_A_wireless-and_mobility-related_view"]}
