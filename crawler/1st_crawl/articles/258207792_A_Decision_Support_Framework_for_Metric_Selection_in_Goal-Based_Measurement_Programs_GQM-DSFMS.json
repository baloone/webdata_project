{"id":"258207792_A_Decision_Support_Framework_for_Metric_Selection_in_Goal-Based_Measurement_Programs_GQM-DSFMS","abstract":"Software organizations face challenges in managing and sustaining their measurement programs over time. The complexity of measurement programs increase with exploding number of goals and metrics to collect. At the same time, organizations usually have limited budget and resources for metrics collection. It has been recognized for quite a while that there is the need for prioritizing goals, which then ought to drive the selection of metrics. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the organizations requires measurement programs to adapt to the changes in the stakeholders, their goals, information needs and priorities. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to use structured approaches that provide transparency, traceability and guidance in choosing an optimum set of metrics that would address the highest priority information needs considering limited resources. This paper proposes a decision support framework for metrics selection (DSFMS) which is built upon the widely used Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach. The core of the framework includes an iterative goal-based metrics selection process incorporating decision making mechanisms in metrics selection, a pre-defined Attributes/Metrics Repository, and a Traceability Model among GQM elements. We also discuss alternative prioritization and optimization techniques for organizations to tailor the framework according to their needs. The evaluation of the GQM-DSFMS framework was done through a case study in a CMMI Level 3 software company.","authors":["Cigdem Gencel","Kai Petersen","Aftab Ahmad Mughal","Muhammad Imran Iqbal"],"meta":["December 2013Journal of Systems and Software 86(12)","DOI:10.1016/j.jss.2013.07.022"],"references":["240857315_Software_Measurement_for_Small_and_Medium_Enterprises","232631437_Evaluation_and_Measurement_of_Software_Process_Improvement-A_Systematic_Literature_Review","225134969_Multiview_Framework_for_Goal_Oriented_Measurement_Plan_Design","224743481_The_measurement_theory_for_software_engineering","221045961_A_Model_for_Selecting_an_Optimum_Set_of_Measures_in_Software_Organizations","220478609_Linking_Software_Development_and_Business_Strategy_Through_Measurement","220277640_Hst_M_Guidelines_for_Conducting_and_Reporting_Case_Study_Research_in_Software_Engineering_Empirical_Software_Engineering_14_131-164","220204412_Facts_and_Perceptions_Regarding_Software_Measurement_in_Education_and_in_Practice_Preliminary_Results","220092281_Establishing_Software_Measurement_Programs","220070466_A_Methodology_for_Collecting_Valid_Software_Engineering_Data","3893431_V-GQM_a_feed-back_approach_to_validation_of_a_GQM_study","3188288_An_Operational_Process_for_Goal-Driven_Definition_of_Measures","3187852_Reply_To_Comments_On_towards_A_Framework_Of_Software_Measurement_Validation","3187784_Towards_a_Framework_for_Software_Measurement_Validation","3187630_Software_Measurement_A_Necessary_Scientific_Basis","263849002_The_Balanced_Scorecard_Translating_Strategy_Into_Action","259426658_Game_Theory_and_Cumulative_Voting_in_Illinois_1902-1954","248423663_What_makes_for_effective_measure-ment","242348806_The_goals_questions_indicators_measures_GQIM_approach_to_the_measurement_of_customer_satisfaction_with_e-commerce_Web_sites","242339266_The_evolution_of_goal-based_information_modelling_Literature_review","239596452_The_goal_question_metric_approach","238681337_Optimization_in_Operations_Research","236944400_Software_Metrics_A_Rigorous_Practical_Approach","228606264_Best_Practice_in_Software_Measurement","225254545_MIS-PyME_Software_Measurement_Maturity_Model-Supporting_the_Definition_of_Software_Measurement_Programs","224343007_Implementing_a_software_measurement_program_in_small_and_medium_enterprises_A_suitable_framework","224257986_Validation_of_a_generic_GQM_based_measurement_framework_for_software_projects_from_industry_practitioners","224101985_An_approach_to_improving_existing_measurement_frameworks","223939261_What's_up_with_software_metrics_-_A_preliminary_mapping_study","222816499_Measuring_where_it_matters_Determining_starting_points_for_metrics_collection","222665848_Measurement_program_success_factors_revisited","222422734_A_framework_for_developing_measurement_systems_and_its_industrial_evaluation","222209732_A_framework_for_the_design_and_verification_of_software_measurement_methods","221542177_Towards_Behavioral_Reflexion_Models","221440353_A_goal_question_metric_based_approach_for_efficient_measurement_framework_definition","221218963_MIS-PyME_Software_Measurement_Maturity_Model-Supporting_the_Definition_of_Software_Measurement_Programs","220902815_Integrating_Goal-Oriented_Measurement_in_Industrial_Software_Engineering_Industrial_Experiences_with_and_Additions_to_the_GoalQuestionMetric_Method_GQM","220673948_Developing_measurement_systems_An_industrial_case_study","220375795_Evaluating_two_ways_of_calculating_priorities_in_requirements_hierarchies_-_An_experiment_on_hierarchical_cumulative_voting","47654159_Requirements_Prioritization","31659957_Translating_Strategy_into_Action_The_Balanced_Scorecard_RS_Kaplan_DP_Norton","4377886_Software_Measurement_and_Estimation_A_Practical_Approach","4200505_Automated_support_for_process-aware_definition_and_execution_of_measurement_plans","3248008_Practical_software_measurement_Objective_information_for_decision_makers_Book_Review","3247788_Implementing_a_software_metrics_program_at_Nokia","3188085_Validation_of_an_approach_for_improving_existing_measurement_frameworks"]}
