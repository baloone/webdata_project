{"id":"337408812_Non-Gaussian_Deterministic_Assimilation_of_Radar-Derived_Precipitation_Accumulations","abstract":"Data assimilation (DA) approaches currently used for operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) generally assume that errors in the background state are Gaussian. At the same time, approaches that make no assumptions regarding the background state probability distribution are gaining attention in research. Most such approaches, including the particle filter, are ensemble DA methods that produce an ensemble of analysis states consistent with the background and observation distributions. The present study instead proposes a non-Gaussian deterministic (NGD) DA method for producing a single deterministic analysis state. Consequently, the usual challenge of maintaining an ensemble with sufficient spread and diversity is avoided. The NGD approach uses background ensembles generated by a standard ensemble Kalman filter.\nA series of non-cycled DA experiments is conducted to evaluate the NGD approach for assimilating precipitation derived from North American weather radars to initialize limited-area deterministic forecasts. The resulting forecasts are compared with those produced using either a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) deterministic analysis or latent heat nudging (LHN). The experimental results indicate that, for forecast lead times beyond 1.5 h, the NGD approach improves precipitation forecasts relative to LHN. The NGD approach also leads to better temperature and zonal wind forecasts at lead times up to 12 h when compared to those obtained with either LHN or the LETKF. For precipitation, the NGD and LETKF approaches produce forecasts that are of comparable quality. Finally, simple strategies are demonstrated that combine the NGD approach for assimilating radar-derived precipitation accumulations with the ensemble-variational approach for assimilating all other observations.","authors":["Mark Buehner","Dominik Jacques"],"meta":["November 2019Monthly Weather Review
