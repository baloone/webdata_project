This research work investigates, curve geometry influences the vehicle drivers in curves based on tracking data. The real-time location accurate mapping-based GPS trajectories on the road network or digital map are important issues for observing real-time position. Today information fusion based on various data sources like sensor-based is regularly increased for IoT based applications. So, Map Matching algorithms for real-time location tracking system, putting special emphasis on path analysis, tracking points monitoring with GPS and IRNSS signals structure, and quality analysis on L2, L5 frequency band. The objective of this research work is to propose a novel map matching algorithm for real-time location tracking, real path analysis, vehicle trajectory computation, and satellite signals analysis on road networks. This work also introduces a mathematical analysis process for the current navigation signals process on the signal waveforms. In this research work, we propose a novel mapping algorithm based on meta-information to describe relative moving objects and determine an accurate path between a candidate location and tracking positions on the road networks.","authors":["S K Prasad","J Rachna","Osamah Ibrahem Khalaf","Dac-Nhuong Le"],"meta":["January 2020Telecommunications and Radio Engineering 79(13):1189-1203","DOI:10.1615/TelecomRadEng.v79.i13.80"],"references":["339774310_Optimization_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Coverage_using_the_Bee_Algorithm","337843486_A_New_Algorithm_on_Application_of_Blockchain_Technology_in_Live_Stream_Video_Transmissions_and_Telecommunications","335677277_Frequency_Estimation_by_the_Method_of_Minimum_Mean_Squared_Error_and_P-value_Distributed_in_the_Wireless_Sensor_Network","335313082_An_Overview_on_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_Finding_Optimal_Location_of_Nodes","334107332_An_adaptive_intelligent_alarm_system_for_wireless_sensor_network","332627246_A_Device_Performance_and_Data_Analytics_Concept_for_Smartphones'_IoT_Services_and_Machine-Type_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","329288081_Map_Matching_Algorithm_Trajectory_and_Sequential_Map_Analysis_on_Road_Network","329016792_A_modified_algorithm_for_improving_lifetime_in_WSN","328828550_Comparison_and_Evaluation_of_Cloud_Processing_Models_in_Cloud-Based_Networks","332756565_Inscribe_the_Exigency_of_Map_Matching_Performance_for_Curve_Navigation_on_RoadHighways"]}
