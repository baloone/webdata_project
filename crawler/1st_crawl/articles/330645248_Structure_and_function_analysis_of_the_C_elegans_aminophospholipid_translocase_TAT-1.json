{"id":"330645248_Structure_and_function_analysis_of_the_C_elegans_aminophospholipid_translocase_TAT-1","abstract":"The Caenorhabditis elegans aminophospholipid translocase TAT-1 maintains phosphatidylserine (PS) asymmetry in the plasma membrane and regulates endocytic transport. Despite these important functions, the structure–function relationship of this protein is poorly understood. Taking advantage of the tat-1 mutations identified by the C. elegans million mutation project, we investigated the effects of 16 single amino acid substitutions on the two functions of the TAT-1 protein. Two substitutions that alter a highly conserved PISL motif in the fourth transmembrane domain and a highly conserved DKTGT phosphorylation motif, respectively, disrupt both functions of TAT-1, leading to a vesicular gut defect and ectopic PS exposure on the cell surface, whereas most other substitutions across the TAT-1 protein, often predicted to be deleterious by bioinformatics programs, do not affect the functions of TAT-1. These results provide in vivo evidence for the importance of the PISL and DKTGT motifs in P4-type ATPases and improve our understanding of the structure–function relationship of TAT-1. Our study also provides an example of how the C. elegans million mutation project helps decipher the structure, functions, and mechanisms of action of important genes.","authors":["Yu-Zen Chen","Katharina Klöditz","Eui-Seung Lee","Diemmy Nguyen"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Cell Science 132(5):jcs.227660","DOI:10.1242/jcs.227660"],"references":["304212034_P4-ATPases_as_Phospholipid_Flippases_Structure_Function_and_Enigmas","261409564_Critical_roles_of_isoleucine-364_and_adjacent_residues_in_a_hydrophobic_gate_control_of_phospholipid_transport_by_the_mammalian_P4-ATPase_ATP8A2","258522166_Caspase-mediated_activation_of_Caenorhabditis_elegans_CED-8_promotes_apoptosis_and_phosphatidylserine_externalisation","242016453_The_Million_Mutation_Project_A_new_approach_to_genetics_in_Caenorhabditis_elegans","232281836_AIF_and_Scythe_Bat3_Regulate_Phosphatidylserine_Exposure_and_Macrophage_Clearance_of_Cells_Undergoing_Fas_APO-1-Mediated_Apoptosis","311362278_Programmed_cell_clearance_From_nematodes_to_humans","308905027_Decoding_P4-ATPase_substrate_interactions","262931494_Caspase-mediated_cleavage_of_phospholipid_flippase_for_apoptotic_phosphatidylserine_exposure","260472422_Phospholipids_More_about_Less","248705007_Xk-Related_Protein_8_and_CED-8_Promote_Phosphatidylserine_Exposure_in_Apoptotic_Cells"]}
