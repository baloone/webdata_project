{"id":"277895434_The_combinatorics_of_LCD_codes_Linear_Programming_bound_and_orthogonal_matrices","abstract":"Linear Complementary Dual codes (LCD) are binary linear codes that meet their\ndual trivially. We construct LCD codes using orthogonal matrices, self-dual\ncodes, combinatorial designs and Gray map from codes over the family of rings\n$R_k$. We give a linear programming bound on the largest size of an LCD code of\ngiven length and minimum distance. We make a table of lower bounds for this\ncombinatorial function for modest values of the parameters.","authors":["Steven T.
