{"id":"266943439_New_development_in_FreeFem","abstract":"-This is a short presentation of the freefem++ software. In Section 1, we recall most of the characteristics of the software, In Section 2, we recall how to to build the weak form of a partial differential equation (PDE) from the strong form. In the 3 last sections, we present different examples and tools to illustrated the power of the software. First we deal with mesh adaptation for problems in two and three dimension, second, we solve numerically a problem with phase change and natural convection, and the finally to show the possibilities for HPC we solve a Laplace equation by a Schwarz domain decomposition problem on parallel computer.","authors":["Frédéric Hecht"],"meta":["December 2012Journal of Numerical Mathematics 20(3)","DOI:10.1515/jnum-2012-0013"],"references":["228965458_bamg_Bidimensional_anisotropic_mesh_generator","228920754_Mesh_adaption_for_the_Black_and_Scholes_equations","228560244_UMFPACK_Version_51_User_Guide","228342747_A_finite_element_discretization_of_the_three-dimensional_Navier-Stokes_equations_with_mixed_boundary_conditions","225146630_A_Posteriori_Error_Estimates_for_Parabolic_Variational_Inequalities","222684851_A_finite_element_method_with_mesh_adaptivity_for_computing_vortex_states_in_fast-rotating_Bose-Einstein_condensates","220492742_Algorithm_832_UMFPACK_V43---an_unsymmetric-pattern_multifrontal_method","220145984_Control_of_the_Effects_of_Regularization_on_Variational_Optic_Flow_Computations","43293819_Mortar_finite_element_discretization_of_a_model_coupling_Darcy_and_Stokes_equations","37279512_A_Posteriori_Error_Analysis_of_the_Method_of_Characteristics","29649076_Automatic_insertion_of_a_turbulence_model_in_the_finite_element_discretization_of_the_Navier-Stokes_equations","301362113_On_the_Implementation_of_an_Interior-Point_Filter_Line-Search_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Nonlinear_Programming","277551253_Algorithm_832","268020850_Numerical_zoom_for_multiscale_problems_with_an_application_to_flows_through_porous_media","266314428_Anisotropic_Mesh_Adaptation_A_Step_Towards_a_Mesh-Independent_and_User-Independent_CFD","245095005_A_comprehensive_numerical_model_for_melting_with_natural_convection","243084112_A_new_finite-element_discretization_of_the_Stokes_problem_coupled_with_the_Darcy_equations","241070603_Numerical_Methods_for_Grade-Two_Fluid_Models","240736742_A_Quality_Tetrahedral_Mesh_Generator_and_Three-Dimensional_Delaunay_Triangulator","229542548_Numerical_comparison_of_some_Hessian_recovery_techniques","227788610_Anisotropic_unstructured_mesh_adaption_for_flow_simulations","227207956_Optimally_Adapted_Meshes_for_Finite_Elements_of_Arbitrary_Order_and_W1p_Norms","226299507_Optimized_Schwarz_Methods","222828757_Fully_anisotropic_goal-oriented_mesh_adaptation_for_3D_steady_Euler_equations","48177763_Optimal_Meshes_for_Finite_Elements_of_Arbitrary_Order","41700539_C_Tools_to_construct_our_user-level_language","29621306_Hybrid_scheduling_for_the_parallel_solution_of_linear_systems","2811474_ARPACK_Users'_Guide_Solution_of_Large_Scale_Eigenvalue_Problems_with_Implicitly_Restarted_Arnoldi_Methods"]}
