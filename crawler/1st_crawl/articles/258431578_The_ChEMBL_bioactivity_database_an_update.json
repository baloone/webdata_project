{"id":"258431578_The_ChEMBL_bioactivity_database_an_update","abstract":"ChEMBL is an open large-scale bioactivity database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl), previously described in the 2012 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue. Since then, a variety of new data sources and improvements\nin functionality have contributed to the growth and utility of the resource. In particular, more comprehensive tracking of\ncompounds from research stages through clinical development to market is provided through the inclusion of data from United\nStates Adopted Name applications; a new richer data model for representing drug targets has been developed; and a number of\nmethods have been put in place to allow users to more easily identify reliable data. Finally, access to ChEMBL is now available\nvia a new Resource Description Framework format, in addition to the web-based interface, data downloads and web services.","authors":["A Patr√≠cia Bento","Anna Gaulton","Anne Hersey","Louisa J Bellis"],"meta":["November 2013Nucleic Acids Research 42(Database issue)","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkt1031","SourcePubMed"],"references":["284907658_Experimental_and_omputational_approaches_to_estimate_solubility_and_permeability_in_drug_discovery_and_development_settings","257870016_Mapping_small_molecule_binding_data_to_structural_domains","242015016_The_Open_Access_Malaria_Box_A_Drug_Discovery_Catalyst_for_Neglected_Diseases","236928896_JSME_a_free_molecule_editor_in_JavaScript","236057940_Profile_of_the_GSK_Published_Protein_Kinase_Inhibitor_Set_Across_ATP-Dependent_and-Independent_Luciferases_Implications_for_Reporter-Gene_Assays","235747916_Update_on_activities_at_the_Universal_Protein_Resource_UniProt_in_2013UniProtConsortiumNucleic_Acids_Res201341D43D47353109423161681","235519688_A_broad_activity_screen_in_support_of_a_chemogenomic_map_for_kinase_signaling_research_and_drug_discovery","234132328_UniChem_A_unified_chemical_structure_cross-referencing_and_identifier_tracking_system","295625243_Experimental_and_Computational_Approaches_to_Estimate_Solubility_and_Permeability_in_Drug_Discovery_and_Development_Settings","241083601_Experimental_and_computational_approaches_to_estimate_solubility_and_permeability_in_drug_discovery_and_development_settings_1_PII_of_original_article_S0169-409X9600423-1_The_article_was_originally_pu"]}
