{"id":"273285600_A_divisibility_approach_to_the_open_boundary_cases_of_Cusick-Li-Stanica's_conjecture","abstract":"In this paper we compute the exact 2-divisibility of exponential sums associated to elementary symmetric Boolean functions. Our computation gives an affirmative answer to most of the open boundary cases of Cusick-Li-Stǎnicǎ’s conjecture. As a byproduct, we prove that the 2-divisibility of these families satisfies a linear recurrence. In particular, we provide a new elementary method to compute 2-divisibility of symmetric Boolean functions.","authors":["Francis Castro","Oscar E.
