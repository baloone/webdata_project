{"id":"280211688_Institutional_Repositories_An_Analysis_of_Trends_and_a_Proposed_Collaborative_Future","abstract":"This study seeks to give libraries a plan for interinstitutional cooperation for institutional repositories that will benefit all involved: researchers, institutions, and, ultimately, global scholarship. This research uses repository studies, interviews with existing repository managers, and the input of libraries considering a repository to inform the exploration of the opportunities for collaboration in IR development and maintenance. This article proposes opportunities for collaboration between institutions in order to convince libraries that it is possible and effective to work together toward a common goal: highlighting existing working groups or alliances, sharing technology and hardware, building separate interinstitutional bodies to house repositories, and sharing the work of specialists.","authors":["Leila Sterman"],"meta":["July 2014College & Undergraduate Libraries 21(3-4):360-376","DOI:10.1080/10691316.2014.943919"],"references":["287777722_An_Overview_of_Issues_Challenges_and_Opportunities_of_Scholarly_Publishing_in_Information_Studies_in_Africa","220364275_Invisible_Institutional_Repositories_Addressing_the_Low_Indexing_Ratios_of_IRs_in_Google_Scholar","292795494_Harvard_Mandates_Open_Access","271818712_Repository_Collection_Policies_Is_a_Liberal_and_Inclusive_Policy_Helpful_or_Harmful","45680378_White_Paper_Title_From_Passive_to_Pervasive_Changing_Perceptions_of_the_Library's_Role_through_Intra-Campus_Partnerships"]}
