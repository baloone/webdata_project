{"id":"299872362_Proxemic-Aware_Controls","abstract":"Remote controls facilitate interactions at-a-distance with appliances. However, the complexity, diversity, and increasing number of digital appliances in ubiquitous computing ecologies make it increasingly difficult to: (1) discover which appliances are controllable; (2) select a particular appliance from the large number available; (3) view information about its status; and (4) control the appliance in a pertinent manner. To mitigate these problems we contribute proxemic-aware controls, which exploit the spatial relationships between a person's handheld device and all surrounding appliances to create a dynamic appliance control interface. Specifically, a person can discover and select an appliance by the way one orients a mobile device around the room, and then progressively view the appliance's status and control its features in increasing detail by simply moving towards it. We illustrate proxemic-aware controls of assorted appliances through various scenarios. We then provide a generalized conceptual framework that informs future designs of proxemic-aware controls.","authors":["David Ledo","Saul Greenberg","Nicolai Marquardt","Sebastian Boring"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1145/2785830.2785871","Conference: the 17th International Conference"],"references":["270903328_What_Makes_a_Prototype_Novel_-A_Knowledge_Contribution_Concern_for_Interaction_Design_Research","266653235_Gradual_Engagement_Facilitating_Information_Exchange_between_Digital_Devices_as_a_Function_of_Proximity","262153761_Cross-device_interaction_via_micro-mobility_and_F-formations","258438270_PICOntrol_Using_a_Handheld_Projector_for_Direct_Control_of_Physical_Devices_through_Visible_Light","233389245_Digits_Freehand_3D_interactions_anywhere_using_a_wrist-worn_gloveless_sensor","221568542_An_Experimental_Comparison_of_Physical_Mobile_Interaction_Techniques_Touching_Pointing_and_Scanning","221540146_Proxemic_Interaction_Designing_for_a_Proximity_and_Orientation-Aware_Environment","221540125_CRISTAL_A_collaborative_home_media_and_device_controller_based_on_a_multi-touch_display","221517082_Touch_projector_Mobile_interaction_through_video","221515150_Research_through_design_as_a_method_for_interaction_design_research_in_HCI","221270509_Zooming_Interfaces_for_Augmented_Reality_Browsers","221015887_Physical_Browsing_Research","220877312_Huddle_Automatically_generating_interfaces_for_systems_of_multiple_connected_appliances","220876930_The_Proximity_Toolkit_Prototyping_Proxemic_Interactions_in_Ubiquitous_Computing_Ecologies","220876896_Pad_A_Zooming_Graphical_Interface_for_Exploring_Alternate_Interface_Physics","220420485_CHARADE_Remote_Control_of_Objects_Using_Free-Hand_Gestures","220141727_Supporting_device_discovery_and_spontaneous_interaction_with_spatial_references","220141325_InfoPoint_A_Device_that_Provides_a_Uniform_User_Interface_to_Allow_Appliances_to_Work_Together_over_a_Network","220141270_Accessing_Context_in_Wearable_Computers","2847747_Mobile_Devices_for_Control","2822645_Bridging_Physical_and_Virtual_Worlds_with_Electronic_Tags","2475334_That_one_there_Pointing_to_establish_device_identity","2363147_Interacting_At_a_Distance_Using_Semantic_Snarfing","2312259_Point_Click_-_Interaction_in_Smart_Environments","275315981_The_Hidden_Dimension","259823297_Living_with_Complexity","235361607_The_Hidden_Dimension","221518532_Object-Oriented_Video_Interaction_with_Real-World_Objects_Through_Live_Video","220877077_Synchronous_gestures_for_multiple_persons_and_computers","3651286_The_Eyes_Have_It_A_Task_by_Data_Type_Taxonomy_for_Information_Visualizations","2318746_The_Eyes_Have_It_A_Task_by_Data_Type_Taxonomy_for_Information_Visualizations"]}
