{"id":"327273856_Composite_Numbers_That_Give_Valid_RSA_Key_Pairs_for_Any_Coprime_p","abstract":"RSA key pairs are normally generated from two large primes p and q. We consider what happens if they are generated from two integers s and r, where r is prime, but unbeknownst to the user, s is not. Under most circumstances, the correctness of encryption and decryption depends on the choice of the public and private exponents e and d. In some cases, specific (s,r) pairs can be found for which encryption and decryption will be correct for any (e,d) exponent pair. Certain s exist, however, for which encryption and decryption are correct for any odd prime râˆ¤s . We give necessary and sufficient conditions for s with this property.","authors":["Barry Fagin"],"meta":["August 2018Information (Switzerland) 9(9)","DOI:10.3390/info9090216"],"references":["2742894_There_are_Infinitely_Many_Carmichael_Numbers","266171887_Cryptanalysis_of_RSA_and_Its_Variants","243069878_On_Fermat's_simple_theorem","239534152_Carmichael_Numbers_of_the_Form_6m112m118m1","225731354_Some_problems_of_'Partitio_Numerorum'_III_On_the_expression_of_a_number_as_a_sum_of_primes","222736823_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Testing_Primality","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
