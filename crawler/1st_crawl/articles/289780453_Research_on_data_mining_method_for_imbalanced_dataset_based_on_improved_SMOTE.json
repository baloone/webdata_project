{"id":"289780453_Research_on_data_mining_method_for_imbalanced_dataset_based_on_improved_SMOTE","abstract":"Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is an effective over-sampling technique and can solve the problem of learning from imbalanced dataset. However, in the process of synthetic sample generating, SMOTE is of some blindness. Therefore, a new kind of over-sampling technique-ASMOTE, is proposed. Based on the distribution of the dataset, ASMOTE adjusts the neighbor selective strategy of SMOTE in order to control the quality of the new sample. Through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that our method augments the classification accuracy rate effectively without increasing the computation complexity.","authors":["Z.-M.
