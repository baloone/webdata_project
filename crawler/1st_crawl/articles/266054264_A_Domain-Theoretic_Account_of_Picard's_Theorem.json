{"id":"266054264_A_Domain-Theoretic_Account_of_Picard's_Theorem","abstract":"The authors present a domain-theoretic version of Picard’s theorem for solving classical initial value problems in ℝ n . For the case of vector fields that satisfy a Lipschitz condition, they construct an iterative algorithm that gives two sequences of piecewise linear maps with rational coefficients, which converge, from below and above respectively, exponentially fast to the unique solution of the initial value problem. They further provide a detailed analysis of the speed of convergence and the complexity of computing the iterates. The algorithm uses proper data types based on rational arithmetic, where no rounding of real numbers is required. The authors thus obtain a sound implementation framework to solve initial value problems. In particular, the use of rational arithmetic guarantees that implementations of their technique will adhere to the bounds on convergence speed and algebraic complexity.","authors":["Abbas Edalat","Dirk Pattinson"],"meta":["January 2007LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics 10","DOI:10.1112/S1461157000001315"],"references":["237073699_Continuous_Lattices_and_Domains","220173321_Domain_theory_and_differential_calculus_functions_of_one_variable","2909885_Domain-theoretic_Solution_of_Differential_Equations_Scalar_Fields","321524558_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","302257634_Computable_functionals","284477636_Solving_initial_value_problems_in_polynomial_time","267191102_Computable_Analysis_and_Differential_Equations","243784589_A_computable_ordinary_differential_equation_which_possesses_no_computable_solution","222009399_On_the_computational_complexity_of_ordinary_differential_equations","220573363_The_Primitive_Recursive_Analysis_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations_and_the_Complexity_of_Their_Solutions","220561005_Validated_Solutions_of_Initial_Value_Problems_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations"]}
