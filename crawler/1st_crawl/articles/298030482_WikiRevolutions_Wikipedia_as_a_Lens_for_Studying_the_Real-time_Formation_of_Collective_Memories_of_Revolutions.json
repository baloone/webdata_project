{"id":"298030482_WikiRevolutions_Wikipedia_as_a_Lens_for_Studying_the_Real-time_Formation_of_Collective_Memories_of_Revolutions","abstract":"In this article, we propose to interpret the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as an online setting in which collective memories about controversial and traumatic events are built in a collaborative way. We present the richness of data available on the phenomenon, providing examples of users' participation in the creation of articles related to the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Finally, we propose possible research directions for the empirical study of collective memory formation of traumatic and controversial events in large populations as they unfold over time.","authors":["Michela Ferron","Paolo Massa"],"meta":["January 2011International Journal of Communication 5:1313-1332"],"references":["323320966_Flashbulb_Memories","310332727_Cultural_Trauma_The_Other_Face_of_Social_Change","297265682_Collective_memory_Collaborative_and_individual_processes_in_remembering","296823019_Social_change_as_trauma","281506674_Collective_memory_and_cultural_identity","277815829_Cultural_Trauma_Slavery_and_the_Formation_of_African_American_Identity","277815512_Toward_a_Theory_of_Cultural_Trauma","275766860_Collective_Memory_and_Cultural_Identity","275618024_Recovered_Roots_Collective_Memory_and_the_Making_of_Israeli_National_Tradition","274521379_National_Trauma_and_Collective_Memory_Major_Events_in_the_American_Century"]}
