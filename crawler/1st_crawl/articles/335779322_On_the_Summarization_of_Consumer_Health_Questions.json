{"id":"335779322_On_the_Summarization_of_Consumer_Health_Questions","abstract":"Question understanding is one of the main\nchallenges in question answering. In real\nworld applications, users often submit natural\nlanguage questions that are longer than\nneeded and include peripheral information that\nincreases the complexity of the question, leading\nto substantially more false positives in answer\nretrieval. In this paper, we study neural\nabstractive models for medical question summarization.\nWe introduce the MeQSum corpus\nof 1,000 summarized consumer health questions.\nWe explore data augmentation methods\nand evaluate state-of-the-art neural abstractive\nmodels on this new task. In particular,\nwe show that semantic augmentation from\nquestion datasets improves the overall performance,\nand that pointer-generator networks\noutperform sequence-to-sequence attentional\nmodels on this task, with a ROUGE-1 score of\n44.16%. We also present a detailed error analysis\nand discuss directions for improvement\nthat are specific to question summarization.","authors":["Asma Ben Abacha","Dina Demner-Fushman"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.18653/v1/P19-1215","Conference: Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics"],"references":["322967520_Semantic_annotation_of_consumer_health_questions","317040087_SemEval-2017_Task_3_Community_Question_Answering","306245022_Adaptive_query_relaxation_and_top-k_result_ranking_over_autonomous_web_databases","334116488_Summarizing_Opinions_Aspect_Extraction_Meets_Sentiment_Prediction_and_They_Are_Both_Weakly_Supervised","334115592_Bottom-Up_Abstractive_Summarization","319209793_Learning_to_Paraphrase_for_Question_Answering","318740838_Get_To_The_Point_Summarization_with_Pointer-Generator_Networks","313037310_MetaMap_Lite_An_evaluation_of_a_new_Java_implementation_of_MetaMap","306093800_Incorporating_Copying_Mechanism_in_Sequence-to-Sequence_Learning","306093038_Modeling_Coverage_for_Neural_Machine_Translation"]}
