{"id":"289587488_Publication_Boost_in_Web_of_Science_Journals_and_Its_Effect_on_Citation_Distributions","abstract":"In this paper we show that the dramatic increase in the number of research\narticles indexed in the Web of Science database impacts the commonly observed\ndistributions of citations within these articles. First, we document that the\ngrowing number of physics articles in recent years is due to existing journals\npublishing more and more papers rather than more new journals coming into being\nas it happens in computer science. And second, even though the references from\nthe more recent papers generally cover a longer time span, the newer papers are\ncited more frequently than the older ones if the uneven paper growth is not\ncorrected for. Nevertheless, despite this change in the distribution of\ncitations, the citation behavior of scientists does not seem to have changed.","authors":["Lovro Å ubelj","Dalibor Fiala"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 68(4):1018-1023","DOI:10.1002/asi.23718","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308062589_The_Dynamics_of_Viral_Marketing","301233136_Diffusion_of_scientific_credits_and_the_ranking_of_scientists","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","277334799_Defining_and_identifying_Sleeping_Beauties_in_science","274403371_Predicting_the_long-term_citation_impact_of_recent_publications","267759663_On_the_Shoulders_of_Giants_The_Growing_Impact_of_Older_Articles","258144941_Prediction_of_highly_cited_papers","257662900_The_growth_of_science_and_database_coverage","250428492_Laws_of_Graph_Evolution_Densiflcation_and_Shrinking_Diameters","220365435_A_model_showing_the_increase_in_time_of_the_average_and_median_reference_age_and_the_decrease_in_time_of_the_Price_Index"]}
