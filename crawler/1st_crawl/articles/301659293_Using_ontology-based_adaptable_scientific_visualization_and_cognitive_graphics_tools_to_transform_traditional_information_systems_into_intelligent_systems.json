{"id":"301659293_Using_ontology-based_adaptable_scientific_visualization_and_cognitive_graphics_tools_to_transform_traditional_information_systems_into_intelligent_systems","abstract":"We present a novel environment for knowledge modeling and visualization for domain ontology design based on metaknowledge representation (metalevel) that was also implemented within an ontological paradigm framework. Metaknowledge representation makes the visual ontology editor more adaptable to the user's individual preferences. This improved adaptability is expected to help domain experts, knowledge engineers, and researchers in their quests to design a domain ontology from scratch, to enhance an existing ontology, or to construct a new ontology based on existing ones, by means of visualizing the results of ontology mediation, merging, and alignment. Improved adaptability also improves collaborative visualization tools for the ontology design process. To demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed approach, we describe the main features of a novel adaptable ontology-based visual ontology editor, called ONTOLIS, and its role in creating a bilingual ontology for the computing domain.","authors":["Svetlana Chuprina","Olfa Nasraoui"],"meta":["January 2016","Project: Information Retrieval"],"references":["273064415_ONTOLOGY_VISUALIZATION_PROTEGE_TOOLS_-_A_REVIEW","270980044_Development_of_Multiplatform_Adaptive_Rendering_Tools_to_Visualize_Scientific_Experiments","257719865_Adaptive_Scientific_Visualization_System_for_Desktop_Computers_and_Mobile_Devices","220422328_Marchionini_G_Exploratory_search_from_finding_to_understanding_Comm_ACM_494_41-46","3453924_Creating_Semantic_Web_Contents_with_Protege-2000","273834709_Development_of_ontology-based_multiplatform_adaptive_scientific_visualization_system","200621922_Weaving_the_Web_The_Original_Design_and_Ultimate_Destiny_of_the_World_Wide_Web"]}
