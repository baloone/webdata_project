{"id":"225806390_An_Activity_Recognition_System_For_Mobile_Phones","abstract":"We present a novel system that recognizes and records the motional activities of a person using a mobile phone. Wireless sensors\nmeasuring the intensity of motions are attached to body parts of the user. Sensory data is collected by a mobile application\nthat recognizes prelearnt activities in real-time. For efficient motion pattern recognition of gestures and postures, feed-forward\nbackpropagation neural networks are adopted. The design and implementation of the system are presented along with the records\nof our experiences. Results show high recognition rates for distinguishing among six different motion patterns. The recognized\nactivity can be used as an additional retrieval key in an extensive mobile memory recording and sharing project. Power consumption\nmeasurements of the wireless communication and the recognition algorithm are provided to characterize the resource requirements\nof the system.","authors":["Norbert Győrbíró","Ákos Fábián","Gergely Hományi"],"meta":["February 2009Mobile Networks and Applications 14(1):82-91","DOI:10.1007/s11036-008-0112-y","SourceDBLP"],"references":["306960201_MyLifeBits_A_personal_database_for_everything","246949156_Next-Generation_Personal_Memory_Aids","221604452_Activity_Recognition_from_Accelerometer_Data","221270563_Context_awareness_via_a_single_device-attached_accelerometer_during_mobile_computing","220774867_Multi-Sensor_Activity_Context_Detection_for_Wearable_Computing","220141927_Recognizing_context_for_annotating_a_live_life_recording","220141879_Wearable_sensing_to_annotate_meeting_recordings","4232643_Activity_Recognition_and_Monitoring_Using_Multiple_Sensors_on_Different_Body_Positions","3877815_Context_awareness_by_analysing_accelerometer_data","2431132_Context_Awareness_by_Analysing_Accelerometer_Data","2315403_Forget-me-not_-_Intimate_Computing_in_Support_of_Human_Memory","298092400_Pattern_recognition_and_feed-forward_networks","249797114_Wearable_sensing_and_disease_monitoring_in_home_environment","246516811_Intille_Activity_recognition_from_user-annotated_acceleration_data","221016026_Activity_Recognition_from_User-Annotated_Acceleration_Data","220674233_A_scalable_mobile_phone-based_system_for_multiple_vital_signs_monitoring_and_healthcare","5584042_Training_Feedforward_Networks_with_the_Marquardt_Algorithm","3998469_Wearable_sensing_to_annotate_meeting_recordings","3927954_Recognizing_human_motion_with_multiple_acceleration_sensors","3436935_Activity_and_Location_Recognition_Using_Wearable_Sensors"]}
