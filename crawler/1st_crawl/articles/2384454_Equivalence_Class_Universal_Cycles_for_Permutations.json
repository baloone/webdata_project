{"id":"2384454_Equivalence_Class_Universal_Cycles_for_Permutations","abstract":"Introduction In this note we describe a representation of permuations of an n-element set that can be viewed as equivalence classes of permuations of length n on n + 1 symbols. An equivalence class universal cycle is a string x 1 x 2 ; : : : ; x n! such that among the n! length n substrings x i x i+1 ; : : : x i+n (subscript addition modulo n!) each equivalence class is represented exactly once. We produce a complete family of n such cycles. In such a family, distinct cycles use distinct representatives and each member of an equivalence class acts as representative exactly once. The notion of universal cycles as cyclic representations of combinatorial objects, as a generalization of DeBruijn cycles, was introduced by Chung,","authors":["G. H.
