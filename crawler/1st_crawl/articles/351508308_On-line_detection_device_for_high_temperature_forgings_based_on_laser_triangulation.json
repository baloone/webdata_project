{"id":"351508308_On-line_detection_device_for_high_temperature_forgings_based_on_laser_triangulation","abstract":"This paper takes the online detection equipment of high temperature forgings in the forging environment as the research goal, and uses laser triangulation to perform 3D point cloud imaging of high temperature forgings, and then conducts online detection of the defects, temperature, position, size and other parameters of the forgings. Real-time information feedback of measurement results, and timely adjustment of forging equipment and improvement of production process routes based on the feedback results, thereby effectively improving forging accuracy and forging efficiency, and reducing the work intensity of workers.","authors":["Shaoshun Bian","PengZhong Zhou","Jiawei Xu","Jin Zhang"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1885(5):052035","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1885/5/052035"],"references":["323638912_Parameters_Optimization_of_Laser_Range_Sensor_Based_on_Triangulation","288404970_Analysis_on_measurement_range_and_precision_of_the_oil_film_thickness_measurement_sensor_based_on_differential_laser_trigonometry","285970476_Development_of_heavy_forging_manufacturing_industry_in_our_country","282706794_Study_on_laser_speckle_correlation_method_applied_in_triangulation_displacement_measurement","260670736_Study_on_laser_speckle_correlation_method_applied_in_triangulation_displacement_measurement"]}
