{"id":"299446858_Performance_Comparison_of_Simulated_Annealing_GA_and_ACO_Applied_to_TSP","abstract":"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is probably one of the most famous problems in combinatorial optimization. There are many techniques to solve the TSP problem such as Ant Colony Optimization ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). In this paper, we conduct a comparison study to evaluate the performance of these three algorithms in terms of execution time and shortest distance. JAVA programming is used to implement the algorithms using three benchmarks on the same platform conditions. Among the three algorithms, we found out that the Simulated Annealing has the shortest time in execution (<1s) but for the shortest distance, it comes in the second order. Furthermore, in term of shortest distance between the cities, ACO performs better than GA and SA. However, ACO comes in the last order in term of time execution.","authors":["Hosam Hasan Mukhairez","Ashraf Yunis Maghari"],"meta":["December 2015International Journal of Intelligent Computing Research Volume 6(Issue 4):647 - 654","DOI:10.20533/ijicr.2042.4655.2015.0080"],"references":["277017426_Article_A_Performance_Comparison_of_GA_and_ACO_Applied_to_TSP","268754854_Worst-case_analysis_of_algorithms_for_travelling_salesman_problems","264704807_Ant_Colony_versus_Genetic_Algorithm_based_on_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","221346170_Ant-Q_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_to_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","251983552_A_hybrid_algorithm_based_on_genetic_algorithm_and_ant_colony_optimization_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problems","239066731_Genetic_Programming_On_the_Programming_of_Computers_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection","236473943_Computational_intelligence_imitating_life","222529491_A_novel_ACO-GA_hybrid_algorithm_for_feature_selection_in_protein_function_prediction","13987583_Ant_Colonies_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","3775775_Entropy-based_genetic_algorithm_for_solving_TSP"]}
