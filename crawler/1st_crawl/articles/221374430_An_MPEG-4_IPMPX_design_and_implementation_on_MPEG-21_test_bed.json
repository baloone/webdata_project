{"id":"221374430_An_MPEG-4_IPMPX_design_and_implementation_on_MPEG-21_test_bed","abstract":"With the growing demand for distributing digital media contents, the issues of protecting the rights of digital contents are becoming more and more important. We introduce the MPEG-4 IPMPX (intellectual property management and protection extension) specification and design its implementation architecture on the MPEG-21 multimedia test bed. This flexible system is capable of having IPMPX tools, such as encryption/decryption and digital watermarking, integrated into it. The main contributions are: (1) we design and integrate a software architecture of the IPMPX system and its APIs into the standard-compliant MPEG-21 test bed; (2) the implementation of the IPMPX architecture is close to the original IPMPX concepts and thus provides a good validation of IPMPX capabilities; (3) we develop an application example on the IPMPX-enabled MPEG-21 test bed to show its powerful functionalities. The IPMPX subsystem together with the application example has been completed and is described.","authors":["Chen-Wei Fan","Feng-Cheng Chang","Hsueh-Ming Hang"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465644","SourceDBLP","Conference: International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 2005), 23-26 May 2005, Kobe, Japan"],"references":["220195003_NIST_Net_A_Linux-based_network_emulation_tool","4018676_FGS-based_video_streaming_test-bed_for_MPEG_21_universal_multimedia_access_with_digital_item_adaptation"]}
