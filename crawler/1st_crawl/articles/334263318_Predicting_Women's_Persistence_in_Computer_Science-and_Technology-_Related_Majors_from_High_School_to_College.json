{"id":"334263318_Predicting_Women's_Persistence_in_Computer_Science-and_Technology-_Related_Majors_from_High_School_to_College","abstract":"While demand for computer science and information technology skills grows, the proportion of women entering computer science (CS) fields has declined. One critical juncture is the transition from high school to college. In our study, we examined factors predicting college persistence in computer science and technology-related majors from data collected from female high school students. We fielded a survey that asked about students' interest and confidence in computing as well as their intentions to learn programming, game design, or invent new technology. The survey also asked about perceived social support from friends and family for pursuing computing as well as experiences with computing, including the CS Advanced Placement (AP) exam, out-of-school time activities such as clubs, and internships. Multinomial regression was used to predict persistence in computing and tech majors in college. Programming during high school, taking the CS Advanced Placement exam and participation in the Aspirations awards program were the best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors. Participation in tech-related work, internships or after school programs was negatively associated with persistence, and involvement with computing sub-domains of game design and inventing new applications were not associated with persistence. Our results suggest that efforts to broaden participation in computing should emphasize education in computer programming.","authors":["Timothy J Weston","Wendy Dubow","Alexis Kaminsky"],"meta":["June 2019ACM Transactions on Computing Education 20(1)","DOI:10.1145/3343195","Project: Learning from Young Women: a Longitudinal, Mixed Methods Study"],"references":["330818796_Cowhand_Programming_and_Success_in_College_Computer_Science","322923983_Pathway_from_Learning_Multimedia_Software_to_Computer_Science_Education","317351499_Ten_Years_toward_Equity_Preliminary_Results_from_a_Follow-Up_Case_Study_of_Academic_Computing_Culture","317044526_Broadening_participation_not_border_protection_how_universities_can_support_women_in_computer_science","300481446_Gender_Differences_in_Factors_Influencing_Pursuit_of_Computer_Science_and_Related_Fields","283279560_Women_15_Times_More_Likely_to_Leave_STEM_Pipeline_After_Calculus_Compared_to_Men_Lack_of_Mathematical_Confidence_a_Potential_Culprit","272837457_Cultural_Stereotypes_as_Gatekeepers_Increasing_Girls'_Interest_in_Computer_Science_and_Engineering_by_Diversifying_Stereotypes","263046069_Widening_the_Net_National_Estimates_of_Gender_Disparities_in_Engineering","261960783_A_Crafts-Oriented_Approach_to_Computing_in_High_School_Introducing_Computational_Concepts_Practices_and_Perspectives_with_Electronic_Textiles","234779325_Gender_Achievement_and_Persistence_in_An_Undergraduate_Computer_Science_Program","228624641_More_than_Paradoxes_to_Offer_Exploring_Motivations_to_Attract_Women_to_Computing","221538859_Exploring_Factors_that_Influence_Computer_Science_Introductory_Course_Students_to_Persist_in_the_Major","327252722_Anatomy_of_an_Enduring_Gender_Gap_The_Evolution_of_Women's_Participation_in_Computer_Science","316948882_Defining_a_Discipline_or_Shaping_a_Community_Constraints_on_Broadening_Participation_in_Computing","316566550_Multiple_Factors_Converge_to_Influence_Women's_Persistence_in_Computing_A_Qualitative_Analysis","312959977_Women_planning_to_major_in_computer_science_Who_are_they_and_what_makes_them_unique","303968818_Improving_the_Persistence_of_First-Year_Undergraduate_Women_in_Computer_Science","284559220_What_motivates_females_and_males_to_pursue_careers_in_mathematics_and_science","283306198_Mitochondrial_superoxide_dismutase_deficiency_accelerates_chronological_aging_in_the_fission_yeast_Schizosaccharomyces_pombe","280286790_Social_cognitive_model_of_adjustment_to_engineering_majors_Longitudinal_test_across_gender_and_raceethnicity","274969069_Predicting_Graduation_The_Role_of_MathematicsScience_Self-Efficacy","274426728_Unlocking_the_clubhouse","270468284_Investigating_forty_years_of_STEM_research_How_explanations_for_the_gender_gap_have_evolved_over_time","250889589_'I'm_not_interested_in_computers'_Gender-based_occupational_choices_of_adolescents","242383716_Gender-Based_Factors_in_Computing_Enrollments_and_Achievement_Evidence_from_a_Study_of_Tertiary_Students","240526619_Gender_Differences_in_High-school_Students'_Views_about_Science","239861330_BEST_PRACTICES_IN_STRUCTURAL_EQUATION_MODELING","239278824_Exploration_of_the_Relationship_Between_Prior_Computing_Experience_and_Gender_on_Success_in_College_Computer_Science","230202999_Pipeline_Persistence_Examining_the_Association_of_Educational_Experiences_With_Earned_Degrees_in_STEM_Among_US_Students","220613100_Unlocking_the_clubhouse_The_Carnegie_Mellon_experience"]}
