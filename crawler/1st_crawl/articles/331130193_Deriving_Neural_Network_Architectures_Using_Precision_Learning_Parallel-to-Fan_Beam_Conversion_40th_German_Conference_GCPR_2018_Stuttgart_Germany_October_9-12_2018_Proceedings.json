The network allows to learn the unknown operators in this conversion in a data-driven manner avoiding interpolation and potential loss of resolution. Integration of known operators results in a small number of trainable parameters that can be estimated from synthetic data only. The concept is evaluated in the context of Hybrid MRI/X-ray imaging where transformation of the parallel-beam MRI projections to fan-beam X-ray projections is required. The proposed method is compared to a traditional rebinning method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to ray-by-ray interpolation and is able to deliver sharper images using the same amount of parallel-beam input projections which is crucial for interventional applications. We believe that this approach forms a basis for further work uniting deep learning, signal processing, physics, and traditional pattern recognition.","authors":["Christopher Syben","Bernhard Stimpel","Jonathan Lommen","Tobias WÃ¼rfl"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-12939-2_35","In book: Pattern Recognition (pp.503-517)"],"references":["321488043_Precision_Learning_Towards_Use_of_Known_Operators_in_Neural_Networks","320975892_Frangi-Net_A_Neural_Network_Approach_to_Vessel_Segmentation","320464852_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Reconstruction_Filter_Kernel_Discretization","316598940_Image_reconstruction_by_domain_transform_manifold_learning","308828451_Deep_Learning_Computed_Tomography","303657108_TensorFlow_A_system_for_large-scale_machine_learning","283025323_Vision_2020_Simultaneous_CT-MRI_-_Next_chapter_of_multimodality_imaging","329317632_Precision_Learning_Towards_Use_of_Known_Operators_in_Neural_Networks","327624460_Some_Investigations_on_Robustness_of_Deep_Learning_in_Limited_Angle_Tomography","325211540_On_the_direct_acquisition_of_beam's-eye-view_images_in_MRI_for_integration_with_external_beam_radiotherapy","324997751_Deep_Learning_Computed_Tomography_Learning_Projection-Domain_Weights_From_Image_Domain_in_Limited_Angle_Problems","314135810_Tutorial_Deep_Learning_Advancing_the_State-of-the-Art_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","227499969_A_truly_hybrid_interventional_MRX-ray_system_Feasibility_demonstration","216213494_The_Fourier_Reconstruction_of_a_Head_Section","17880509_Three-Dimensional_Reconstruction_from_Radiographs_and_Electron_Micrographs_Application_of_Convolutions_Instead_of_Fourier_Transforms"]}
