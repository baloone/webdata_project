{"id":"306076944_H-index_manipulation_by_merging_articles_Models_theory_and_experiments","abstract":"An author's profile on Google Scholar consists of indexed articles and associated data, such as the number of citations and the H-index. The author is allowed to merge articles; this may affect the H-index. We analyze the (parameterized) computational complexity of maximizing the H-index using article merges. Herein, to model realistic manipulation scenarios, we define a compatibility graph whose edges correspond to plausible merges. Moreover, we consider several different measures for computing the citation count of a merged article. For the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm that maximizes the H-index in linear time if the compatibility graph has constant-size connected components. In contrast, if we allow to merge arbitrary articles (that is, for compatibility graphs that are cliques), then already increasing the H-index by one is NP-hard. Experiments on Google Scholar profiles of AI researchers show that the H-index can be manipulated substantially only if one merges articles with highly dissimilar titles.","authors":["René van Bevern","Christian Komusiewicz","Rolf Niedermeier","Manuel Sorge"],"meta":["October 2016Artificial Intelligence 240:19–35","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2016.08.001","Project: H-index manipulation"],"references":["305069825_h-Index_Manipulation_by_Undoing_Merges","301877195_h-Index_Manipulation_by_Undoing_Merges","301598220_Improved_approaches_to_the_exact_solution_of_the_machine_covering_problem","276182716_H-Index_Manipulation_by_Merging_Articles_Models_Theory_and_Experiments","262409910_New_Races_in_Parameterized_Algorithmics","285766852_Recent_developments_in_kernelization_A_survey","277292372_Strategic_Candidacy_and_Voting_Procedures","266972132_Google_Scholar_makes_it_Hard_-_the_complexity_of_organizing_one's_publications","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","260304863_AI's_10_to_Watch"]}
