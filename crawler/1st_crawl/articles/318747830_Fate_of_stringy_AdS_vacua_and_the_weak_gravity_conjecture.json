{"id":"318747830_Fate_of_stringy_AdS_vacua_and_the_weak_gravity_conjecture","abstract":"Ooguri and Vafa [arXiv:1610.01533] have recently proposed a stronger version of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), based on which they concluded that all those nonsupersymmetric AdS vacua that can be embedded within a consistent theory of quantum gravity necessarily develop instabilities. In this paper we further elaborate on this proposal by arguing that the aforementioned instabilities have a perturbative nature and arise from the crucial interplay between the closed and the open string sectors of the theory.","authors":["Ulf Danielsson","Giuseppe Dibitetto"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevD.96.026020"],"references":["315953437_Unstoppable_brane-flux_decay_of_D_6_branes","301836455_A_new_6d_fixed_point_from_holography","253697901_Charting_the_landscape_of_N_4_flux_compactifications","233871695_On_the_horizon_instability_of_an_extreme_Reissner-Nordstrom_black_hole","230977076_Metastable_vacua_and_D-branes_at_the_conifold","221662142_Resolving_anti-brane_singularities_through_time-dependence","6161718_Nondecoupling_of_Maximal_Supergravity_from_the_Superstring","312432775_The_Power_of_Duality_Exact_Results_in_4D_SUSY_Field_Theory","311244490_There_and_back_again_a_T-brane's_tale","303683749_Universal_isolation_in_the_AdS_landscape","263907539_THE_POWER_OF_DUALITY_-_EXACT_RESULTS_IN_4D_SUSY_FIELD_THEORY","251143126_The_LargeN_Limit_of_Superconformal_Field_Theories_and_Supergravity","225322602_Stability_and_Instability_of_Extreme_Reissner-Nordstrom_Black_Hole_Spacetimes_for_Linear_Scalar_Perturbations_II","48173134_Perturbations_of_near-horizon_geometries_and_instabilities_ofMyers-Perry_black_holes","2085759_Anti-de_Sitter_Fragmentation","2063262_Type_IIA_moduli_stabilization","2047151_AdS_in_Warped_Spacetimes","1757867_AdS4_flux_vacua_in_type_II_superstrings_and_their_domain-wall_solutions"]}
