{"id":"323838694_Cognitive_Psychology_History","abstract":"Modern cognitive psychology began in the late 1950s, when American and British psychologists rejected behaviorism and adopted a model of the mind based on the computer. The overthrow of behaviorism came not so much from ideas within psychology as from three research approaches external to the field, including: (1) communications research including information theory; (2) the computer modeling approach, particularly the work of Newell and Simon; and (3) the generative linguistics approach, particularly the work of Chomsky. The merging of these approaches with substantive psychology led to the information-processing approach to cognition, which emphasized the representations and processes needed to give rise to mental activities ranging from pattern recognition, attention, categorization, memory, reasoning, decision making, problem solving, and language.","authors":["E.E.
