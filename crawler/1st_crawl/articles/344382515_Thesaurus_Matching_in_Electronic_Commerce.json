{"id":"344382515_Thesaurus_Matching_in_Electronic_Commerce","abstract":"This paper tackles the problem of e-commerce thesauri alignment. It includes the definition of three alignment techniques which can be combined to increase the effectiveness and reduce the execution time. It also introduces a filtering technique to reduce the number of candidates returned to the final user. This work reports a set of evaluations that were lead with real-world data. Results show that the proposed techniques outperform schema, the state-of-the-art approach. They also drastically reduce the execution time, thus making them more usable in real-world applications.","authors":["Thomas Cerqueus","Jonathan Bonnaud","Oleksandr Dashkov","Emmanuel Morin"],"meta":["October 2020Electronic Commerce Research","DOI:10.1007/s10660-020-09438-9"],"references":["290564834_An_Automated_Approach_to_Product_Taxonomy_Mapping_in_E-Commerce","290564696_Mapping_product_taxonomies_in_e-commerce","266857831_Automated_product_taxonomy_mapping_in_an_e-commerce_environment","262424922_An_Automatic_Approach_for_Mapping_Product_Taxonomies_in_E-Commerce_Systems","262424433_SCHEMA_-_An_Algorithm_for_Automated_Product_Taxonomy_Mapping_in_E-commerce","242623376_Anchor-PROMPT_Using_NonLocal_Context_for_Semantic_Matching","240312285_Ontology_Mapping_Between_Heterogeneous_Product_Taxonomies_in_an_Electronic_Commerce_Environment","281013529_AROMA_an_implicative_ontology_matching_method_based_on_the_association_rule_model","252292779_Schema_Matching_and_Mapping","222410003_The_PROMPT_suite_Interactive_tools_for_ontology_merging_and_mapping","221614331_Matching_directories_and_OWL_ontologies_with_AROMA","221466389_An_Ontology_Mapping_Algorithm_between_Heterogeneous_Product_Classification_Taxonomies","221560009_Structure-Based_Methods_to_Enhance_Geospatial_Ontology_Alignment","220605916_Structural_Alignment_Methods_with_Applications_to_Geospatial_Ontologies","220538523_AgreementMaker_Efficient_Matching_for_Large_Real-World_Schemas_and_Ontologies"]}
