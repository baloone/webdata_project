{"id":"262566431_Superiority_always_and_everywhere_-_On_some_misconceptions_in_the_validation_of_Dynamic_Testing","abstract":"Dynamic assessment, as an alternative approach to assessing intellectual capacities, focuses on examineesâ€™\nability to benefit from learning opportunities provided within the assessment process. The level of appreciation\nof the potential advantages of this assessment concept is not mirrored by the extent of its utilisation in\npractice. One reason for this constraint might be that, allegedly, the proponents of this approach have not yet\nsucceeded in showing sufficient evidence for the validity of their assessment tools. The diversity within the\nfield of dynamic assessment, characterised by a variety in the goals pursued, the methods employed, and philosophical\nperspectives on measurement makes it difficult to pass sentence regarding its validity. In the study\npresented, a set of dynamic tests has been used to exemplify a suggested strategy to evaluate dynamic tests in\nterms of validity. This strategy emphasised: (1) the explication of the construct dynamic tests are aiming at,\nand its relationship to other constructs; (2) the definition of construct representative external criteria; and\n(3) the demonstration of both predictive and incremental validity. Furthermore, it was conceptually argued\nand empirically demonstrated that a variation of correlations between tests and external criteria across different\n(sub-) samples or studies can be explained as differential validity of dynamic tests, which is compatible\nwith the conceptual understanding of the construct addressed in such learning tests and would be\nmisinterpreted as an indicator of inconsistencies in validity-related findings in dynamic tests.","authors":["Jens F Beckmann"],"meta":["January 2006Educational and Child Psychology 23(3):35-49","Project: Dynamic Testing"],"references":["265594100_Interactive_assessment","248942886_Applications_and_Challenges_in_Dynamic_Assessment","343413453_Learning_Potential_Assessment_Epilogue","292412844_All_testing_is_dynamic_testing","289963578_Validity","262566468_Psychodiagnostik_des_schlussfolgernden_Denkens_The_assessment_of_reasoning_ability","262566313_Adaptive_Computergestutzte_Intelligenz-Lerntestbatterie_ACIL_The_Adaptive_Computer-Based_Learning_Test_Battery","262566196_Zur_Validierung_des_Konstrukts_des_intellektuellen_Veranderungspotentials_On_the_validation_of_the_construct_of_intellectual_change_potential","262566163_Dynamic_Assessment_with_Diagnostic_Programs","232585159_Intelligence_as_the_Tests_Test_It"]}
