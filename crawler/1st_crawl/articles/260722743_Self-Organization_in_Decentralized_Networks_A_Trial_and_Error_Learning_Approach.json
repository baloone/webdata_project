{"id":"260722743_Self-Organization_in_Decentralized_Networks_A_Trial_and_Error_Learning_Approach","abstract":"In this paper, the problem of channel selection and power control is jointly analyzed in the context of multiple-channel clustered ad-hoc networks, i.e., decentralized networks in which radio devices are arranged into groups (clusters) and each cluster is managed by a central controller (CC). This problem is modeled by game in normal form in which the corresponding utility functions are designed for making some of the Nash equilibria (NE) to coincide with the solutions to a global network optimization problem. In order to ensure that the network operates in the equilibria that are globally optimal, a learning algorithm based on the paradigm of trial and error learning is proposed. These results are presented in the most general form and therefore, they can also be seen as a framework for designing both games and learning algorithms with which decentralized networks can operate at global optimal points using only their available local knowledge. The pertinence of the game design and the learning algorithm are highlighted using specific scenarios in decentralized clustered ad hoc networks. Numerical results confirm the relevance of using appropriate utility functions and trial and error learning for enhancing the performance of decentralized networks.","authors":["Luca Rose","Samir Perlaza","Christophe J.
