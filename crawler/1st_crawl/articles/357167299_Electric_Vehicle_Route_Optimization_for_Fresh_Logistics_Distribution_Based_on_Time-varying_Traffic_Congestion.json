{"id":"357167299_Electric_Vehicle_Route_Optimization_for_Fresh_Logistics_Distribution_Based_on_Time-varying_Traffic_Congestion","abstract":"The electric vehicle routing planning for fresh logistics distributions based on time-varying traffic conditions is investigated in this paper. With the time-varying traffic network, the calculation method for travel time is designed based on a route section division strategy. A three-constraint decision factor method is designed to consider the minimum product freshness limit, vehicle load constraints, and electric vehicle power constraints. A distribution route optimization model for electric vehicles is established for the urban logistics distribution of fresh products to minimize the total distribution cost. An improved ant colony algorithm is proposed, in which its parameters are adjusted adaptively. Simulation results show that this method can properly arrange the departure time and plan the distribution route to avoid traffic congestion, according to the requirements of product freshness, customer attributes, and road network characteristics. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed model and algorithm can significantly reduce the distribution cost and improve the economic benefits of enterprises.","authors":["Z.-X. Zhao","X.-M.
