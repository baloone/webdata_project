{"id":"263466217_Fourier_Transforms_and_Bent_Functions_on_Finite_Abelian_Group-Acted_Sets","abstract":"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group acting faithfully on a finite set $X$.\nAs a natural generalization of the perfect nonlinearity of Boolean functions,\nthe $G$-bentness and $G$-perfect nonlinearity of functions on $X$ are \nstudied by Poinsot et al. [6,7] via Fourier transforms of functions on $G$.\nIn this paper we introduce the so-called $G$-dual set $\\widehat X$ of $X$,\nwhich plays the role similar to the dual group $\\widehat G$ of $G$, and \nthe Fourier transforms of functions on $X$, a generalization of the Fourier\ntransforms of functions on finite abelian groups. Then we characterize the bent\nfunctions on $X$ in terms of their own Fourier transforms on $\\widehat X$.\nBent (perfect nonlinear) functions on finite abelian groups and $G$-bent \n($G$-perfect nonlinear) functions on $X$ are treated in a uniform way in this \npaper, and many known results in [2,4,6,7] are obtained as direct consequences. \nFurthermore, we will prove that the bentness of a function on $X$ can be \ndetermined by its distance from the set of $G$-linear functions.\nIn order to explain the main results clearly, examples are also presented.","authors":["Yun Fan","Bangteng Xu"],"meta":["March 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 82(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0177-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283190938_Dual_bent_functions_on_finite_groups_and_C-algebras","278811419_Group_actions_based_perfect_nonlinearity","271999231_Bentness_and_nonlinearity_of_functions_on_finite_groups","267436515_Bent_functions_from_a_finite_abelian_group_into_a_finite_abelian_group","265995871_Bent_functions_on_a_finite_nonabelian_group","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","261475801_Multidimensional_Fourier_transforms_and_nonlinear_functions_on_finite_groups","256391988_On_bent_functions","250969329_Bent_functions_on_a_finite_Abelian_group","242583571_Linear_Representations_of_Finite_Groups"]}
