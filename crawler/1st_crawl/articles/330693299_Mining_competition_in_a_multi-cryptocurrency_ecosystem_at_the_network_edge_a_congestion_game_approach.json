{"id":"330693299_Mining_competition_in_a_multi-cryptocurrency_ecosystem_at_the_network_edge_a_congestion_game_approach","abstract":"We model the competition over several blockchains characterizing multiple cryptocurrencies as a non-cooperative game. Then, we specialize our results to two instances of the general game, showing properties of the Nash equilibrium. In particular, leveraging results about congestion games, we establish the existence of pure Nash equilibria and provide efficient algorithms for finding such equilibria.","authors":["Eitan Altman","Alexandre Reiffers-Masson","Daniel S.
