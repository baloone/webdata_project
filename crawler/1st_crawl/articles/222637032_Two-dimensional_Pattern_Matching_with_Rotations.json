{"id":"222637032_Two-dimensional_Pattern_Matching_with_Rotations","abstract":"The problem of pattern matching with rotation is that of finding all occurrences of a two-dimensional pattern in a text, in all possible rotations. We prove an upper and lower bound on the number of such different possible rotated patterns. Subsequently, given an m×m array (pattern) and an n×n array (text) over some finite alphabet Σ, we present a new method yielding an O(n2m3) time algorithm for this problem.","authors":["Amihood Amir","Ayelet Butman","Maxime Crochemore","Gad Landau"],"meta":["February 2004Theoretical Computer Science 314(1-2):173-187","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2003.10.039","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["227303909_On_the_construction_of_classes_of_suffix_trees_for_square_matrices_Algorithms_and_applications","3871304_An_image_similarity_measure_based_on_graph_matching","2946953_A_Rotation_Invariant_Filter_for_Two--dimensional_String_Matching","2504224_Optimal_Exact_and_Fast_Approximate_Two_Dimensional_Pattern_Matching_Allowing_Rotations","2419512_Geometric_Matching_under_Noise_Combinatorial_Bounds_and_Algorithms","2375180_An_Index_for_Two_Dimensional_String_Matching_Allowing_Rotations","2363970_Combinatorial_methods_for_approximate_pattern_matching_under_rotations_and_translations_in_3D_arrays","274075955_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","256555108_Fast_Parallel_and_Serial_Multidimensional_Approximate_Array_Matching","239168571_Fast_filters_for_two_dimensional_string_matching_allowing_rotations","235047912_String-Matching_and_Other_Products","228057969_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences","225035528_Pattern_Matching_Algorithms","222466819_Two-dimensional_dictionary_matching","220898657_On_the_Construction_of_Classes_of_Suffix_Trees_for_Square_Matrices_Algorithms_and_Applications","220694260_An_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Numbers","220618471_Generalized_String_Matching","220555899_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences_Computer_Science_and_Computational_Biology","220248419_On_the_Construction_of_Classes_of_Suffix_Trees_for_Square_Matrices_Algorithms_and_Applications","3785001_Pattern_matching_for_spatial_point_sets","2869431_Pattern_Matching_for_Spatial_Point_Sets","2802184_Real_Scaled_Matching","2772195_Faster_Scaled_Matching","2443582_Pattern_Matching_in_a_Digitized_Image","2390918_Algorithms_on_Strings_Trees_and_Sequences_Computer_Science_and_Computational"]}
