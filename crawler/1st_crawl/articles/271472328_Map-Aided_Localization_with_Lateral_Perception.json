{"id":"271472328_Map-Aided_Localization_with_Lateral_Perception","abstract":"Accurate localization of a vehicle is a challenging task as GPS available on the market are not designed for lane-level accuracy application. Although dead reckoning helps, cumulative errors from inertial sensors result in a integration drift. This paper presents a new method of localization based on sensors data fusion. An accurate digital map of the lane marking is used as a powerful additional sensor. Road markings are detected by processing two lateral cameras to estimate their distance to the vehicle. Coupled with the map data in a EKF filter it improves the ego-localization obtained with inertial and GPS measurements. The result is a vehicle localization at an ego-lane level of accuracy, with a lateral error of less than 10 centimeters.","authors":["Dominique Gruyer","Rachid Belaroussi","Marc Revilloud"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/IVS.2014.6856528","Conference: 2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)"],"references":["261493662_A_new_approach_for_robust_road_marking_detection_and_tracking_applied_to_multi-lane_estimation","261353014_Mapping_and_localization_using_GPS_lane_markings_and_proprioceptive_sensors","261245965_GPS-bias_correction_for_precise_localization_of_autonomous_vehicles","313179337_Particle_filters_for_positioning_navigation_tracking","269332317_Cumulative_error_estimation_from_noisy_relative_measurements","261246044_Vehicle_localization_using_road_markings","261116592_Localization_in_digital_maps_for_road_course_estimation_using_grid_maps","260729829_Vehicle_self-localization_with_high-precision_digital_maps","260357134_Accurate_Global_Localization_Using_Visual_Odometry_and_Digital_Maps_on_Urban_Environments","260305326_Accurate_Ego-Vehicle_Global_Localization_at_Intersections_Through_Alignment_of_Visual_Data_With_Digital_Map"]}
