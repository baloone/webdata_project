{"id":"320362579_iProg_development_of_immersive_systems_for_the_learning_of_programming","abstract":"Basic \"computing literacy\" is said to be deemed necessary for all citizens, and provides an opportunity to prepare, over longer periods of time, future computing engineers. The iProg Project intends to achieve computing literacy research objectives by means of a number of applications for Programming Education, based on different techniques for advanced Computer-Human Interaction and visualization, including augmented reality and gesture-based interaction. The evaluation of Usability and User Experience of these new forms of interaction will require the use of advanced interaction techniques, including eye tracking and the gathering of biometric information.","authors":["Manuel Ortega","Javier Alejandro Jiménez Toledo","Huizilopoztli Luna-Garcia","J.
