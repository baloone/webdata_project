{"id":"334081316_A_framework_for_dynamic_risk_assessment_with_condition_monitoring_data_and_inspection_data","abstract":"In this paper, a framework is proposed for integrating condition monitoring and inspection data in Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA). Condition monitoring data are online-collected by sensors and indirectly relate to component degradation; inspection data are recorded in physical inspections that directly measure the component degradation. A Hidden Markov Gaussian Mixture Model (HM-GMM) is developed for modeling the condition monitoring data and a Bayesian network (BN) is developed to integrate the two data sources for DRA. Risk updating and prediction are exemplified on an Event Tree (ET) risk assessment model. A numerical case study and a real-world application on a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) are performed to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework.","authors":["Jinduo Xing","Zhiguo Zeng","Enrico Zio"],"meta":["June 2019Reliability Engineering [?] System Safety 191(1):106552","DOI:10.1016/j.ress.2019.106552"],"references":["353431999_Bayesian_Estimation_of_Remaining_Useful_Life_for_Wind_Turbine_Blades","328896297_A_Sequential_Bayesian_Approach_for_Remaining_Useful_Life_Prediction_of_Dependent_Competing_Failure_Processes","323360063_Data-driven_dynamic_risk_analysis_of_offshore_drilling_operations","322324638_Dynamic_Risk_Assessment_Based_on_Statistical_Failure_Data_and_Condition-Monitoring_Degradation_Data","323909488_Failure_Rate_Updates_using_Condition-based_Prognostics_in_Probabilistic_Safety_Assessments","323843151_Dynamic-weighted_ensemble_for_fatigue_crack_degradation_state_prediction","322178081_Condition-based_probabilistic_safety_assessment_of_a_spontaneous_steam_generator_tube_rupture_accident_scenario","322073834_Reliability_and_maintenance_policies_for_a_two-stage_shock_model_with_self-healing_mechanism","322032338_Clarifying_the_concept_of_operational_risk_assessment_in_the_oil_and_gas_industry","321168358_Unavailability_Assessment_of_Redundant_Safety_Instrumented_Systems_Subject_to_Process_Demand"]}
