{"id":"221101350_Evaluating_N-gram_based_Evaluation_Metrics_for_Automatic_Keyphrase_Extraction","abstract":"This paper describes a feasibility study of n-gram-based evaluation metrics for automatic keyphrase extraction. To account for near-misses currently ignored by standard evaluation metrics, we adapt various evaluation metrics developed for machine translation and summarization, and also the R-precision evaluation metric from keyphrase evaluation. In evaluation, the R-precision metric is found to achieve the highest correlation with human annotations. We also provide evidence that the degree of semantic similarity varies with the location of the partially-matching component words.","authors":["Su Nam Kim","Timothy Baldwin","Min-Yen Kan"],"meta":["December 2010","SourceDBLP","Conference: COLING 2010, 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference, 23-27 August 2010, Beijing, China"],"references":["228898348_Textual_entailment_features_for_machine_translation_evaluation","228867748_A_Keyphrase-based_Approach_to_Summarization_the_LAKE_System_at_DUC-2005","228567003_SemEval-2010_Task_5_Automatic_Keyphrase_Extraction_from_Scientific_Articles","228340500_Meteor_m-bleu_and_m-ter_Evaluation_metrics_for_high-correlation_with_human_rankings_of_machine_translation_output","224061561_Thesaurus_based_automatic_keyphrase_indexing","221347768_KEA_Practical_Automatic_Keyphrase_Extraction","234075852_Approximate_Matching_for_Evaluating_Keyphrase_Extraction","231747415_Applied_morphological_processing_of_English","224890498_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Summaries_Using_n-gram_Co-occurrence_Statistics","221485204_The_1999_NIST_speaker_recognition_evaluation_using_summed_two-channel_telephone_data_for_speaker_detection_and_speaker_tracking"]}
