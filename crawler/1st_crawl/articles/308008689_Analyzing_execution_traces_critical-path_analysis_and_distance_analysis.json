{"id":"308008689_Analyzing_execution_traces_critical-path_analysis_and_distance_analysis","abstract":"System designers make trade-offs between metrics of interest such as execution time, functional quality and cost to create a properly balanced system. Execution traces, which are sequences of timestamped start and end events of system tasks, are a general and powerful means to understand the system behavior that gives rise to these trade-offs. Such traces can be produced by, e.g., executable models or prototype systems. Their interpretation, however, often is non-trivial. We present two automated analysis techniques that work on execution traces to help the system designer with interpretation. First, critical-path analysis can be used to answer the typical “what is the bottleneck” question, and we extend earlier work of [16] with a technique that uses application information to refine the analysis. Second, we define a pseudo-metric on execution traces, which is useful for calibration and validation purposes, and which can be used to visualize the differences between traces. Both techniques are based on a common graph representation of execution traces. We have implemented our techniques in the Trace visualization tool [12], and have applied them in a case study from the digital printing domain.","authors":["Martijn Hendriks","Jacques Verriet","Twan Basten","Bart Theelen"],"meta":["August 2017International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer 19(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10009-016-0436-z","Project: Octo+ project"],"references":["261494103_Distance-Based_Trace_Diagnosis_for_Multimedia_Applications_Help_Me_TED","306885174_Critical_path_analysis_of_TCP_transactions","292020261_Introduction_to_Algorithms","272040975_A_blueprint_for_system-level_performance_modeling_of_software-intensive_embedded_systems","270549195_Comparing_stars","266428273_The_Basic_Concepts_and_Constructions_of_General_Topology","261422040_Reconstructing_Critical_Paths_from_Execution_Traces","261355744_Scalable_Critical-Path_Based_Performance_Analysis","253967421_A_Programming_Aid_for_Message-passing_Systems","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242930619_Some_Properties_of_Schedules_for_Large_Projects_with_Limited_Resources","242506068_An_Introduction_to_Critical_Path_Analysis","239661022_Hardware-Software_Co-Design_of_Embedded_Systems-The_Polis_Approach","239549225_Hardware-software_co-design_of_embedded_systems--the_polis_experience","234758234_Critical-Path_Planning_and_Scheduling"]}
