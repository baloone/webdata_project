{"id":"279307622_Automatic_text_classification_method_based_on_Zipf's_law","abstract":"This paper describes a method for automatic text classification based on analyzing the deviation\nof the word distribution from Zipf’s law, combined with the zonal data processing approach. Deviation is\nunderstood as the difference between the actual numerical score of a word calculated based ob its frequency and its score calculated according\nto Zipf’s law. The proposed method involves the division of input and reference texts into J0, J1, and J2 zones,\nand the creation of a numerical series using the words that are contained in the J0 zone. The constructed\nnumerical series shows the difference between the real scores of words and the scores calculated\naccording to Zipf’s law. The proposed method can significantly reduce text dimensionality and thus improve\nthe running speed of automatic text classification\nTo get full text go to http://yatsko.zohosites.com/academic-works.html","authors":["Viatcheslav A.
