{"id":"307444130_Finding_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","abstract":"We study the deterministic and randomized query complexity of finding approximate equilibria in a k × k bimatrix game. We show that the deterministic query complexity of finding an &epsi;-Nash equilibrium when &epsilon < ½ is Ω(k²), even in zero-one constant-sum games. In combination with previous results [Fearnley et al. 2013], this provides a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity of approximate Nash equilibria. We also study randomized querying algorithms. We give a randomized algorithm for finding a (3−&sqrt;5/2 + ε)-Nash equilibrium using O(k.log k/ε²) payoff queries, which shows that the ½ barrier for deterministic algorithms can be broken by randomization. For well-supported Nash equilibria (WSNE), we first give a randomized algorithm for finding an &epsi;-WSNE of a zero-sum bimatrix game using O(k.log k/ε⁴) payoff queries, and we then use this to obtain a randomized algorithm for finding a (&frac23; + ε)-WSNE in a general bimatrix game using O(k.log k/ε⁴) payoff queries. Finally, we initiate the study of lower bounds against randomized algorithms in the context of bimatrix games, by showing that randomized algorithms require Ω(k²) payoff queries in order to find an &epsi;-Nash equilibrium with ε < 1/4k, even in zero-one constant-sum games. In particular, this rules out query-efficient randomized algorithms for finding exact Nash equilibria.","authors":["John Fearnley","Rahul Savani"],"meta":["August 2016ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation 4(4):1-19","DOI:10.1145/2956579"],"references":["286512949_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","283532081_Well-Supported_versus_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_Query_Complexity_of_Large_Games","269876159_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Anonymous_Games","266658384_Bounds_for_the_query_complexity_of_approximate_equilibria","257142896_Polylogarithmic_Supports_Are_Required_for_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_below_23","235509448_Learning_Equilibria_of_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","225754383_Well_Supported_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","220853326_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games","220465612_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220152526_Polynomial_algorithms_for_approximating_Nash_equilibria_of_bimatrix_games","200033999_Progress_in_approximate_nash_equilibria","345772508_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Approximate_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria","311569080_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","243458309_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria","228762446_Methods_for_empirical_game-theoretic_analysis_extended_abstract","222101118_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_Below_Two-Thirds","222069855_A_note_on_approximate_Nash_equilibria","221606716_Methods_for_Empirical_Game-Theoretic_Analysis","221444972_Approximating_Nash_equilibria_using_small-support_strategies","41386442_New_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
