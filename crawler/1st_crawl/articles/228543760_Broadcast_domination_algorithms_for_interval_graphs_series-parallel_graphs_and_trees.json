{"id":"228543760_Broadcast_domination_algorithms_for_interval_graphs_series-parallel_graphs_and_trees","abstract":"Broadcast domination assigns an integer value f (u) â‰¥ 0 to each vertex u of a given graph, such that every vertex u with f (u) = 0 is within distance f (v) from a vertex v with f (v) > 0. We can regard the vertices v with f (v) > 0 as broadcast stations, each having a transmission power that might be different from the powers of other stations. The optimal broadcast domination problem seeks to minimize the sum of the costs of the broadcasts assigned to the vertices of the graph. We present dynamic programming algorithms that solve the optimal broadcast domination problem for the first classes of graphs with non-trivial solutions: interval graphs, series-parallel graphs, and trees. We also show that optimal broadcast domination is equivalent to optimal domination on proper interval graphs.","authors":["Jean R. S.
