{"id":"275387427_Life_Is_Too_Short_to_RTFM_How_Users_Relate_to_Documentation_and_Excess_Features_in_Consumer_Products","abstract":"This paper addresses two common problems that users of various products and interfaces encounter—over-featured interfaces\nand product documentation. Over-featured interfaces are seen as a problem as they can confuse and over-complicate everyday\ninteractions. Researchers also often claim that users do not read product documentation, although they are often exhorted\nto ‘RTFM’ (read the field manual). We conducted two sets of studies with users which looked at the issues of both manuals\nand excess features with common domestic and personal products. The quantitative set was a series of questionnaires administered\nto 170 people over 7 years. The qualitative set consisted of two 6-month longitudinal studies based on diaries and interviews\nwith a total of 15 participants. We found that manuals are not read by the majority of people, and most do not use all the\nfeatures of the products that they own and use regularly. Men are more likely to do both than women, and younger people are\nless likely to use manuals than middle-aged and older ones. More educated people are also less likely to read manuals. Over-featuring\nand being forced to consult manuals also appears to cause negative emotional experiences. Implications of these findings are\ndiscussed.","authors":["Alethea L.
