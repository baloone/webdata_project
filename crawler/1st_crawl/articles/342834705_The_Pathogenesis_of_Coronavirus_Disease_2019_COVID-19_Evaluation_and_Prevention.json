{"id":"342834705_The_Pathogenesis_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Evaluation_and_Prevention","abstract":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major health problem causing severe acute respiratory illness in humans. It\nhas spread rapidly around the globe since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The causative virus is called\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the World Health Organization (WHO) named the new\nepidemic disease Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The incidence of COVID-19 continues to increase with more than three\nmillion confirmed cases and over 244,000 deaths worldwide. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-\n19. Therefore, in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, the implementation of precautions and hygienic measures will be\nessential to control and to minimize human transmission of the virus. In this review, we highlight the epidemiology,\ntransmission, symptoms, and treatment of this disease, as well as future strategies to manage the spread of this fatal coronavirus.","authors":["Hayat Ouassou","Loubna Kharchoufa","Mohamed Bouhrim","Nour Elhouda Daoudi"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Immunology Research 2020(New Insights into Immune-based Diagnosis, Therapy and Prophylaxis for Infectious Diseases 2020):7","DOI:10.1155/2020/1357983"],"references":["341070827_Traditional_Chinese_medicine_for_treatment_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_a_review","340086673_Traditional_Chinese_Medicine_in_the_Treatment_of_Patients_Infected_with_2019-New_Coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2_A_Review_and_Perspective","340031319_SARS-CoV-2_and_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_What_We_Know_So_Far","339995962_Epidemiology_causes_clinical_manifestation_and_diagnosis_prevention_and_control_of_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_during_the_early_outbreak_period_A_scoping_review","339970952_COVID-19_infection_Origin_transmission_and_characteristics_of_human_coronaviruses","339938915_The_Author's_Response_Case_of_the_Index_Patient_Who_Caused_Tertiary_Transmission_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_in_Korea_the_Application_of_LopinavirRitonavir_for_the_Treatment_of_COVID-19_Pneumonia_Moni","339907086_Potential_Inhibitor_of_COVID-19_Main_Protease_Mpro_From_Several_Medicinal_Plant_Compounds_by_Molecular_Docking_Study","353059973_Traditional_Chinese_medicine_for_treatment_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_a_review","339984155_Clinical_characteristics_of_refractory_COVID-19_pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China","339846615_Genetic_evolution_analysis_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_and_coronavirus_from_other_species"]}
