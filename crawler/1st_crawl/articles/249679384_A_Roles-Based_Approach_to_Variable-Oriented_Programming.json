{"id":"249679384_A_Roles-Based_Approach_to_Variable-Oriented_Programming","abstract":"Delocalized variable plans pose problems for novice program- mers trying to read and write programs. Variable-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the importance of variable- related schemas and brings actions pertaining to each variable together in one place in program code. This paper revisits the idea of variable- oriented programming and shows how it can be founded on roles of vari- ables, stereotypes of variable use suitable for teaching to novices. The pa- per sketches out how variable-oriented, roles-based programming could be implemented using either a new programming language or a frame- work built on an existing language. The possible applications, merits and problems of a roles-based approach and variable-oriented program- ming in general are discussed. This paper points at possible research directions for the future and provides a basis for further discussions of variable-oriented, roles-based programming.","authors":["Juha Sorva"],"meta":["May 2008Human Technology 4(1)","DOI:10.17011/ht/urn.200804151353"],"references":["234800767_A_Multi-National_Study_of_Reading_and_Tracing_Skills_in_Novice_Programmers","228623601_Roles_of_variables_in_three_programming_paradigms","220613379_A_multi-national_multi-institutional_study_of_assessment_of_programming_skills_of_first-year_CS_students","220590706_Roles_of_Variables_in_Teaching","262319037_Program_editing_based_on_variable_plans_a_cognitive_approach_to_program_manipulation","242602039_What_do_novices_know_about_programming","238711370_Roles_of_variables_home_page","235678850_Empirical_Studies_of_Programming_Knowledge","228629288_An_Experiment_on_Using_Roles_of_Variables_in_Teaching_Introductory_Programming","222465728_Schema_Creation_in_Programming"]}
