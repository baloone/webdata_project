{"id":"330895087_Wiener_index_of_a_fuzzy_graph_and_application_to_illegal_immigration_networks","abstract":"Connectivity parameters have important role in the study of networks in the physical world. Wiener index is one such parameter with several applications in chemistry and network theory. In this article Wiener index of various fuzzy graph structures like fuzzy trees and fuzzy cycles are discussed. Relationship between connectivity index and Wiener index of a fuzzy graph is also studied. For the effective computation of Wiener Index of a fuzzy graph an algorithm is proposed. A real life application related with human trafficking and illegal immigration is presented towards the end.","authors":["Binu Mothirakkattil","Sunil Mathew","J.N.
