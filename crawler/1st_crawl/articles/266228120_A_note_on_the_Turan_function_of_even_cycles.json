{"id":"266228120_A_note_on_the_Turan_function_of_even_cycles","abstract":"The Turán function ex (n,F) is the maximum number of edges in an F-free graph on n vertices. The question of estimating this function for F=C 2k , the cycle of length 2k, is one of the central open questions in this area that goes back to the 1930s. We prove that ex (n,C 2k )≤(k-1)n 1+1/k +16(k-1)n, improving the previously best known general upper bound of J. Verstraëte [Comb. Probab.
