{"id":"317224131_Rolling_round_process_of_four-roll_and_its_springback_analysis","abstract":"The rolls' position of the four-roll plate bending machine during rolling plate is very important for the accurate forming. The force and deformation conditions of plate in the pre-bending forming of rolling round were analyzed, the relation equation for the position of side roll during loading and the deflection line of plate before springback was established through simplifying the pre-bending process to a cantilever beam with concentrated force. Then, according to the plane bending springback equation, the deflection line equation of plate after unloading the springback was analyzed. Adapting materials q255 and st12, the theory and experiment of the left pre-bending, and the theory and simulation of the right pre-bending were compared. The results show that the relative error of deflection is less than 3% for the comparison during left pre-bending and is less than 5% for the comparison during right pre-bending, the radius of curvature is less than 4% between theory and simulation of rolling round after revising by correction factor, which shows that the theoretical model can realize the accurate forming.
