Dreyfus and Winograd draw heavily on hermeneutics to question the feasibility of AI and cognitive science. But, hermeneutics also offers insights that may contribute to the understanding of meaning, translation, architectures for natural language understanding, and even to the methods suitable for scientific inquiry in AI.
