{"id":"313091050_A_New_Approach_for_the_Verification_of_Infinite-Step_and_K-Step_Opacity_using_Two-Way_Observers","abstract":"In the context of security analysis for information flow properties, where a potentially malicious observer (intruder) tracks the observed behavior of a given system, infinite-step opacity (respectively, K-step opacity) holds if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system was in a secret state for any instant within infinite steps (respectively, K steps) prior to that particular instant. We present new algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as finite-state automata. Our new algorithms are based on a novel separation principle for state estimates that characterizes the information dependence in opacity verification problems, and they have lower computational complexity than previously-proposed ones in the literature. Specifically, we propose a new information structure, called the two-way observer, that is used for the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity. Based on the two-way observer, a new upper bound for the delay in K-step opacity is derived, which also improves previously-known results.","authors":["Xiang Yin","Stephane Lafortune"],"meta":["June 2017Automatica 80","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.037"],"references":["307594039_A_new_approach_for_enforcing_opacity_via_supervisory_control_for_partially-observed_discrete-event_systems","304410814_A_general_approach_for_solving_dynamic_sensor_activation_problems_for_a_class_of_properties","294873311_Overview_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Opacity_models_validation_and_quantification","282426709_A_Uniform_Approach_for_Synthesizing_Property-Enforcing_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","276250083_Maximum_Information_Release_While_Ensuring_Opacity_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","271952544_Enforcing_Opacity_of_Regular_Predicates_on_Modal_Transition_Systems","271640261_Enforcement_and_Validation_at_runtime_of_Various_Notions_of_Opacity","261154349_Initial_state_opacity_in_stochastic_DES","260710564_Verification_of_Infinite-Step_Opacity_and_Complexity_Considerations","258396483_Verification_of_Opacity_and_Diagnosability_for_Pushdown_Systems","224560885_Verification_and_Synthesis_for_Secrecy_in_Discrete-Event_Systems","224217859_Verification_of_K-Step_Opacity_and_Analysis_of_Its_Complexity","221234537_Anonymous_Usage_of_Location-Based_Services_Through_Spatial_and_Temporal_Cloaking","220673772_Synthesis_of_opaque_systems_with_static_and_dynamic_masks","220370810_Modelling_Opacity_Using_Petri_Nets","220066873_Opacity_Generalised_to_Transition_Systems","216813077_Introduction_to_Discrete_Event_Systems","44390147_The_Dark_Side_of_Timed_Opacity","29611818_Supervisory_Control_for_Opacity","29596895_Concurrent_Secrets","312973479_Anonymous_usage_of_location-based_services_through_spatial_and_temporal_cloaking","309441959_Verification_of_State-Based_Opacity_Using_Petri_Nets","304456653_On_two-way_observer_and_its_application_to_the_verification_of_infinite-step_and_K-step_opacity","303791259_Obfuscator_Synthesis_for_Privacy_and_Utility","271475773_Ensuring_Privacy_in_Location-Based_Services_An_Approach_Based_on_Opacity_Enforcement","269259156_Enforcing_Opacity_of_Regular_Predicates_on_Modal_Transition_Systems","264005469_Probabilistic_Opacity_for_Markov_Decision_Processes","260909856_Synthesis_of_insertion_functions_for_enforcement_of_opacity_security_properties","260711447_Current-State_Opacity_Formulations_in_Probabilistic_Finite_Automata","260661556_Opacity-Enforcing_Supervisory_Strategies_via_State_Estimator_Constructions","258496005_A_Formula_for_the_Supremal_Controllable_and_Opaque_Sublanguage_Arising_in_Supervisory_Control","257555732_Comparative_analysis_of_related_notions_of_opacity_in_centralized_and_coordinated_architectures","240388653_Using_uni_cation_for_opacity_properties","238503358_Coverage_analysis_of_mobile_agent_trajectory_via_state-based_opacity_formulations","234780126_Stochastic_Systems_Estimation_Identification_and_Adaptive_Control","224303381_Notions_of_security_and_opacity_in_discrete_event_systems","222648242_Opacity_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_and_Its_Applications","4364926_Verification_of_initial-state_opacity_in_security_applications_of_DES"]}
