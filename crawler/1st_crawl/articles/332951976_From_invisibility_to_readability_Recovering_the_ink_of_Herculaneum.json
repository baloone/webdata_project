{"id":"332951976_From_invisibility_to_readability_Recovering_the_ink_of_Herculaneum","abstract":"The noninvasive digital restoration of ancient texts written in carbon black ink and hidden inside artifacts has proven elusive, even with advanced imaging techniques like x-ray-based micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This paper identifies a crucial mistaken assumption: that micro-CT data fails to capture any information representing the presence of carbon ink. Instead, we show new experiments indicating a subtle but detectable signature from carbon ink in micro-CT. We demonstrate a new computational approach that captures, enhances, and makes visible the characteristic signature created by carbon ink in micro-CT. This previously “unseen” evidence of carbon inks, which can now successfully be made visible, is a discovery that can lead directly to the noninvasive digital recovery of the lost texts of Herculaneum.","authors":["Clifford Seth Parker","Stephen Parsons","Jack Bandy","Christy Chapman"],"meta":["May 2019PLoS ONE 14(5):e0215775","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0215775"],"references":["326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","326921337_Virtual_Recovery_of_Content_from_X-Ray_Micro-Tomography_Scans_of_Damaged_Historic_Scrolls","324078235_Classification_of_crystallization_outcomes_using_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","323407906_An_assessment_of_multimodal_imaging_of_subsurface_text_in_mummy_cartonnage_using_surrogate_papyrus_phantoms","313815223_Revealing_hidden_text_in_rolled_and_folded_papyri","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","316806141_3D_Deeply_Supervised_Network_for_Automated_Segmentation_of_Volumetric_Medical_Images","313072707_3D_U-Net_Learning_Dense_Volumetric_Segmentation_from_Sparse_Annotation","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311754161_V-Net_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Volumetric_Medical_Image_Segmentation"]}
