{"id":"334416883_Quantum-based_predictive_fog_scheduler_for_IoT_applications","abstract":"Load scheduling across distributed fog computing nodes has been a major challenge to meet the\nincreased demand of real-time data analysis, and time-sensitive decision-making. This study presents a\nQuantum Computing-inspired (QCi) optimized load scheduling technique in fog computing environ-\nments for real-time IoT applications. In addition to this, QCi-Neural Network Model is used as a\npredictive model to determine the optimal computational node for enabling real-time service delivery.\nFor validation, simulations were performed using 3, 5, 7, and 10 fog nodes at different instances to\nschedule nearly 600 heterogeneous tasks to obtain the respective results. Results were compared with\nother state-of-the-art scheduling models like Minâ€“Max, Minimum Completion time, and Round Robin.\nBetter results were registered for the proposed technique in terms of minimum average task completion\ntime (28.15 s for 10 nodes) and average energy consumption (3.48 J for 10 nodes). Moreover, higher rates\nof statistical parameters like sensitivity (88.66%), specificity (91.28%), precision (92.25%), and coverage\n(95.66%) were acquired depicting enhanced overall performance.\n2019","authors":["Munish Bhatia","Sandeep Kumar Sood"],"meta":["July 2019Computers in Industry 111(OCTOBER 2019):51-67","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2019.06.002"],"references":["331434418_Task_Scheduling_Based_on_a_Hybrid_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Smart_Production_Line_with_Fog_Computing","329034913_Exploring_Temporal_Analytics_in_Fog-Cloud_Architecture_for_Smart_Office_HealthCare","326359269_Deploying_Fog_Computing_in_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_and_Industry_40","325210659_Secure_and_Sustainable_Load_Balancing_of_Edge_Data_Centers_in_Fog_Computing","323008505_Cloud_Service_Ranking_Using_Checkpoint-Based_Load_Balancing_in_Real-Time_Scheduling_of_Cloud_Computing","328176859_Guest_Editorial_Fog_Computing_for_Industrial_Applications","325742707_Vehicular_Fog_Computing_Enabling_Real-Time_Traffic_Management_for_Smart_Cities","324046986_Hybrid_Quantum-Behaved_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Mobile-Edge_Computation_Offloading_in_Internet_of_Things","322892893_A_Machine_Learning_Model_for_Improving_Healthcare_services_on_Cloud_Computing_Environment","322041043_A_Survey_on_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Parallel_and_Distributed_Systems","320848675_Heuristic-based_load-balancing_algorithm_for_IaaS_cloud","318752520_Minimizing_delay_in_IoT_systems_through_collaborative_fog-to-fog_F2F_communication","321465271_Workload_prediction_in_cloud_using_artificial_neural_network_and_adaptive_differential_evolution","320932129_Load_Balancing_Mechanism_Using_Fuzzy_Row_Penalty_Method_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment","320213310_Package-Based_Approach_for_Load_Balancing_in_Cloud_Computing"]}
