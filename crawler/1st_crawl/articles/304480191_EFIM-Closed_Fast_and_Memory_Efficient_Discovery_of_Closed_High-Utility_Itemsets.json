{"id":"304480191_EFIM-Closed_Fast_and_Memory_Efficient_Discovery_of_Closed_High-Utility_Itemsets","abstract":"Discovering high-utility temsets in transaction databases is a popular data mining task. A limitation of traditional algorithms is that a huge amount of high-utility itemsets may be presented to the user. To provide a concise and lossless representation of results to the user, the concept of closed high-utility itemsets was proposed. However, mining closed high-utility itemsets is computationally expensive. To address this issue, we present a novel algorithm for discovering closed high-utility itemsets, named EFIM-Closed. This algorithm includes novel pruning strategies named closure jumping, forward closure checking and backward closure checking to prune non-closed high-utility itemsets. Furthermore, it also introduces novel utility upper-bounds and a transaction merging mechanism. Experimental results shows that EFIM-Closed can be more than an order of magnitude faster and consumes more than an order of magnitude less memory than the previous state-of-art CHUD algorithm.","authors":["Philippe Fournier Viger","Souleymane Zida","Chun-Wei Jerry Lin","Cheng-Wei Wu"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-41920-6_15","In book: Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition (pp.199-213)"],"references":["300783058_Efficient_Mining_of_High-Utility_Sequential_Rules","286345164_BAHUI_Fast_and_Memory_Efficient_Mining_of_High_Utility_Itemsets_Based_on_Bitmap","285408497_TKS_Efficient_Mining_of_Top-K_Sequential_Patterns","282265209_SPMF_A_java_open-source_pattern_mining_library","273352609_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_the_Concise_and_Lossless_Representation_of_High_Utility_Itemsets","263696687_FHM_Faster_High-Utility_Itemset_Mining_Using_Estimated_Utility_Co-occurrence_Pruning","262369808_Mining_high_utility_itemsets_without_candidate_generation","263578829_An_efficient_projection-based_indexing_approach_for_mining_high_utility_itemsets","260026660_High_utility_itemset_mining_with_techniques_for_reducing_overestimated_utilities_and_pruning_candidates","235949400_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_High_Utility_Itemsets_from_Transactional_Databases"]}
