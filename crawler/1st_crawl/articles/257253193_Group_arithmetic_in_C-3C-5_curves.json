{"id":"257253193_Group_arithmetic_in_C-3C-5_curves","abstract":"In this paper we present a fast addition algorithm in the Jacobian of a C-3,C-5 curve over a finite field F-q. We give formulae for D-1 circle plus D-2 = -(D-1 + D-2) which require 2I + 264M + 10S when D-1 not equal D-2 and 2I + 297M + 13S when D-1 = D-2; and for the computation of -D which require 2I + 41M + 3S. The circle plus operation is sufficient to compute scalar multiplications after performing a single (initial) -D. Computing the scalar multiplication [k]D, based on the previous fact combined with our algorithm for computing D-1 circle plus D-2, is to date the fastest one performing this operation for C-3,C-5 curves. These formulae can be easily combined to compute the full group addition and doubling in 3I + 308M + 13S and 3I + 341M + 16S respectively, which compares favorably with previously presented formulae.","authors":["Roger Oyono","Nicolas Thériault"],"meta":["November 2013Journal of Symbolic Computation 56:1–26","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2013.05.008"],"references":["225696112_Fast_Jacobian_Group_Arithmetic_on_Cab_Curves","220576551_Arithmetic_on_superelliptic_curves","220334684_Fast_addition_on_non-hyperelliptic_genus_3","29647810_A_double_large_prime_variation_for_small_genus_hyperelliptic_index_calculus","2131756_Fast_Jacobian_group_operations_for_C_34_curves_over_a_large_finite_field","312627077_A_subexponential_algorithm_for_discrete_logarithms_over_the_rational_subgroup_of_the_Jacobians_of_large_genus_hyperelliptic_curves_over_finite_fields","268018864_An_addition_algorithm_on_the_Jacobian_varieties_of_curves","265681769_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","252723506_Rethinking_low_genus_hyperelliptic_Jacobian_arithmetic_over_binary_fields_interplay_of_field_arithmetic_and_explicit_formulae","239059459_Computing_in_the_Jacobian_of_a_Hyperelliptic_Curve","225771651_Implementing_the_Arithmetic_of_C34_Curves","222575993_An_addition_algorithm_in_Jacobian_of_Cab_curves","221451628_A_subexponential_algorithm_for_discrete_logarithms_over_the_rational_subgroup_of_the_Jacobians_of_large_genus_hyperelliptic_curves_over_finite_fields","221451469_Improving_Group_Law_Algorithms_for_Jacobians_of_Hyperelliptic_Curves","221451455_An_Index_Calculus_Algorithm_for_Plane_Curves_of_Small_Degree","221238552_Effects_of_Optimizations_for_Software_Implementations_of_Small_Binary_Field_Arithmetic","221010711_Fast_Arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_Curves","220661793_On_Using_Expansions_to_the_Base_of_-2","220479176_Hyperelliptic_Cryptosystems","220336225_Aspects_of_Hyperelliptic_Curves_over_Large_Prime_Fields_in_Software_Implementations","45851502_Factorization_with_genus_2_curves","29617678_Index_Calculus_in_Class_Groups_of_Non-hyperelliptic_Curves_of_Genus_Three","29604491_The_arithmetic_of_Jacobian_groups_of_superelliptic_cubics","1737312_Isogenies_and_the_Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_in_Jacobians_of_Genus_3_Hyperelliptic_Curves"]}
