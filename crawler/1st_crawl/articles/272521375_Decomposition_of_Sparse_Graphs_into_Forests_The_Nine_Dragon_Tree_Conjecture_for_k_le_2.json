{"id":"272521375_Decomposition_of_Sparse_Graphs_into_Forests_The_Nine_Dragon_Tree_Conjecture_for_k_le_2","abstract":"For a loopless multigraph $G$, the fractional arboricity $Arb(G)$ is the\nmaximum of $\\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1}$ over all subgraphs $H$ with at least two\nvertices. Generalizing the Nash-Williams Arboricity Theorem, the Nine Dragon\nTree Conjecture asserts that if $Arb(G)\\le k+\\frac{d}{k+d+1}$, then $G$\ndecomposes into $k+1$ forests with one having maximum degree at most $d$. The\nconjecture was previously proved for $d=k+1$ and for $k=1$ when $d \\le 6$. We\nprove it for all $d$ when $k \\le 2$, except for $(k,d)=(2,1)$.","authors":["Min Chen","Seog-Jin Kim","Alexandr V.
