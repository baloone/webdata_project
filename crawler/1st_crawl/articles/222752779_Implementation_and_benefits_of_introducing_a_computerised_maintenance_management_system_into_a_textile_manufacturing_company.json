{"id":"222752779_Implementation_and_benefits_of_introducing_a_computerised_maintenance_management_system_into_a_textile_manufacturing_company","abstract":"Equipment, be it sophisticated or basic in operation and design, depending on its usage, will inevitably malfunction and breakdown. Within any organisation where manufacture is the primary activity, it is crucial that procedures exist for equipment maintenance. Not only does equipment maintenance need to be planned for, the possibility and probability of breakdowns and disruption to operations must also be considered when planning and scheduling production. This paper examines the basis of various maintenance management strategies used to date in international manufacturing. These strategies assist the maintenance function and enable the process of maintenance to be optimised. Special attention is given to Computerised Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs), how this particular strategy was successfully implemented in a medium sized Irish textile manufacturing company.","authors":["C.D.
