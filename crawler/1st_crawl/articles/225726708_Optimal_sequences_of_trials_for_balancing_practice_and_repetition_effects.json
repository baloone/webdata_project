{"id":"225726708_Optimal_sequences_of_trials_for_balancing_practice_and_repetition_effects","abstract":"This paper describes procedures for generating trial sequences to balance out practice effects and intertrial repetition effects\nin experiments consisting of repeated trials. In the sequences presented, each stimulus appears an equal number of times,\nis preceded equally often by itself and by each other stimulus, and is distributed in a “balanced” manner throughout the block\nof trials. Two criteria for balance are employed. One criterion aims to equalize the average position of each stimulus in\nthe sequence. The second criterion maintains, as much as possible, a uniform interval between appearances of each stimulus\nin the sequence. For each criterion, optimal or near-optimal sequences are presented for experiments involving from three\nto nine different stimulus conditions. Suggestions are included for extending (e.g., doubling or tripling) the length of the\nsequences.","authors":["Hansuk Sohn","Dennis L. Bricker","J. Richard Simon","Y.C.
