{"id":"293099285_Book_Recommendation_Based_on_Book-Loan_Logs","abstract":"Information overload affects the efficiency of resource utilization. To tackle the problems, book recommendation is one of the solutions for university libraries which possess huge volumes of books and reading-intensive users. The users borrow books mainly for course-learning and academic-studying, which means the recommendation strategy should consider not only personalization but also the commonness driven by curricular necessity. This paper first studies the users behaviors on a large scale book-loan logs of a university library; then implements two recommendation algorithms based on the book-loan data, one of which is the classical item-based cooperation filtering recommendation algorithm, the other is a probability-based algorithm proposed in this paper. The average precision of the probability-based algorithm performs better in a random sampled testing set. The paper finally discusses the application cases of different algorithms in university libraries' routine work.","authors":["Chong Chen","Liya Zhang","Huan Qiao","Shihong Wang"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-34752-8_33","Conference: International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries"],"references":["242104348_Item-based_top-_N_recommendation_algorithms","235357340_Empirical_Analysis_of_Predictive_Algorithm_for_Collaborative_Filtering","221300976_On_Social_Networks_and_Collaborative_Recommendation","220173171_A_Survey_of_Collaborative_Filtering_Techniques","220073604_Editorial_State_of_the_Transactions","200121014_Item-based_collaborative_filtering_recommendation_algorithmus","3297245_Probabilistic_Memory-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","238799778_Recommender_systems_Commun_ACM","221509159_Users'_Book-Loan_Behaviors_Analysis_and_Knowledge_Dependency_Mining","4286043_Book_Recommendation_Service_by_Improved_Association_Rule_Mining_Algorithm"]}
