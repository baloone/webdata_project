{"id":"318675096_Teaching_Digital_Pathology_The_International_School_of_Digital_Pathology_and_Proposed_Syllabus","abstract":"Digital pathology is an interdisciplinary field where competency in pathology, laboratory techniques, informatics, computer science, information systems, engineering, and even biology converge. This implies that teaching students about digital pathology requires coverage, expertise, and hands-on experience in all these disciplines. With this in mind, a syllabus was developed for a digital pathology summer school aimed at professionals in the aforementioned fields, as well as trainees and doctoral students. The aim of this communication is to share the context, rationale, and syllabus for this school of digital pathology.","authors":["Vincenzo Della Mea","Antonino Carbone","Carla Di Loreto","Gloria Bueno"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Pathology Informatics 8(1):27","DOI:10.4103/jpi.jpi_17_17","Projects: AIDPATHDigital Pathology"],"references":["308869391_A_novel_leadership_fellowship_in_digital_pathology","221968026_All_aboard_Cytotechnology_student_training_in_pathology_informatics","304992921_Pathology_Informatics_Essentials_for_Residents_A_Flexible_Informatics_Curriculum_Linked_to_Accreditation_Council_for_Graduate_Medical_Education_Milestones"]}
