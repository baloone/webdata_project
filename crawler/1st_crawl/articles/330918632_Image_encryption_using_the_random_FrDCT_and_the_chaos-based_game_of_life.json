{"id":"330918632_Image_encryption_using_the_random_FrDCT_and_the_chaos-based_game_of_life","abstract":"A novel image encryption algorithm using the random fractional DCT (RFrDCT) and the chaos-based Game of Life (GoL) is presented here. Firstly the plaintext image is transformed by the reality-preserving RFrDCT into the RFrDCT domain, and a preliminary encryption output is obtained. And then a combination of the confusion and diffusion (C&D) processes is performed in the transform domain, where the confusion process is carried out by GoL, and the diffusion process is carried out by an XOR operation. Therefore a more random-like encryption result can be obtained after further encryption by the C&D. Both the GoL and XOR operation are based on chaos whose control parameters serve as cipher keys in order to enlarge cipher space and enhance key sensitivity. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments for the proposed algorithm are described, the desirable encryption performance is obtained, and it is secure against various common attacks.","authors":["Jianhua Wu","Xingyu Cao","Xifa Liu","Lujuan Ma"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Modern Optics 66(21):1-12","DOI:10.1080/09500340.2019.1571249"],"references":["328151283_An_Intelligent_Real-Time_Occupancy_Monitoring_System_with_Enhanced_Encryption_and_Privacy","282546760_Chaos-based_diffusion_for_highly_autocorrelated_data_in_encryption_algorithms","282424495_Single_channel_Four-image_encryption_technique_based_on_Modified_multiple-parameter_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_scrambling_technique","272201387_Image_encryption_combining_multiple_generating_sequences_controlled_fractional_DCT_with_dependent_scrambling_and_diffusion","260348137_Digital_Image_Scrambling_Using_2D_Cellular_Automata","223046793_A_new_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_hyper-chaos","5784507_Optical_encryption_by_double-random_phase_encoding_in_the_fractional_Fourier_domain","3318261_The_fractional_discrete_cosine_transform","320994855_Cryptanalysis_and_Enhancements_of_Image_Encryption_Using_Combination_of_the_1D_Chaotic_Map","315319319_Silhouette-free_image_encryption_using_interference_in_the_multiple-parameter_fractional_Fourier_transform_domain","312312752_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_the_memristive_hyperchaotic_system_cellular_automata_and_DNA_sequence_operations","309713082_A_hyper-chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_using_pixel-level_permutation_and_bit-level_permutation","309185198_Image_encryption_using_a_synchronous_permutation-diffusion_technique","308393184_Image_encryption_scheme_based_on_random_fractional_discrete_cosine_transform_and_dependent_scrambling_and_diffusion","299642402_Image_Encryption_Based_on_the_Iterative_Fractional_Fourier_Transform_and_a_Novel_Pixel_Scrambling_Technique","291011132_A_hybrid_image_encryption_algorithm_using_chaos_and_Conway's_game-of-life_cellular_automata","290175482_Evaluating_the_Permutation_and_Diffusion_Operations_Used_in_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Chaotic_maps","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","269384344_A_novel_image_encryption_technique_based_on_Hnon_chaotic_map_and_S-8_symmetric_group","268235154_Color_image_encryption_based_on_color_blend_and_chaos_permutation_in_the_reality-preserving_multiple-parameter_fractional_Fourier_transform_domain","260885283_Stable_State_Analysis_of_an_Immune_Network_Model","260871410_Chaotic_Substitution_for_Highly_Autocorrelated_Data_in_Encryption_Algorithm","257344566_A_new_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_a_chaotic_function","256818523_A_hybrid_strategy_for_cryptanalysis_of_optical_encryption_based_on_double-random_phase-amplitude_encoding","251489742_Image_encryption_using_Game_of_Life_permutation_and_PWLCM_chaotic_system","232641926_Optical_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_Multiple-parameter_Random_Fractional_Fourier_Transform","223009419_Optical_image_encryption_using_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_chaos","222766271_Some_important_fractional_transformations_for_signal_processing","222752234_Image_encryption_and_decryption_using_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_radial_Hilbert_transform","222646844_A_symmetric_image_encryption_based_on_3D_chaotic_cat_maps","220225771_A_novel_color_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos","216637965_Mathematical_games_The_fantastic_combinations_of_John_Conway's_new_solitaire_game_life","215658839_A_robust_and_secure_chaotic_standard_map_based_pseudorandom_permutation-substitution_scheme_for_image_encryption","51919410_Security_enhancement_of_phase-truncation_based_image_encryption_algorithm","38038584_Optical_Image_Encryption_Using_Input_Plane_and_Fourier_Plane_Random_Encoding","26311880_Resistance_of_the_double_random_phase_encryption_against_various_attacks","4169776_Measuring_encryption_quality_for_bitmap_images_encrypted_with_rijndael_and_KAMKAR_block_ciphers"]}
