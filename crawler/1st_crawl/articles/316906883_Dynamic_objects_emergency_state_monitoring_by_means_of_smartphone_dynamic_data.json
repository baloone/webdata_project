Input data was summarized for low cost sensors experiment. Central server was used for collecting, saving data and initial data processing. Possible ways of data processing were analyzed for rising information capability of imperfect data.","authors":["Viktor Shevchenko","Oleksiy Bychkov","Alina Shevchenko"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1109/CADSM.2017.7916138","Conference: 2017 14th International Conference The Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems in Microelectronics (CADSM)"],"references":[]}
