{"id":"332327955_Transitioning_International_Software_Engineering_Standards_to_Academia_Analyzing_the_Results_of_the_Adoption_of_ISOIEC_29110_In_Four_Mexican_Universities","abstract":"Software standards, targeted for the software industry, were developed to contribute to the development of quality products within budget and schedule, by optimizing efforts and resources. For small companies, the largest percentage of software companies in Mexico, they are fundamental for their growth and survival. However, academic programs do not always match industry requirements. In previous studies, the curricula in Computer Science and Informatics, and Software Engineering, of 4 Mexican universities, were compared with two software industry standards: the MoProSoft standard, a Mexican standard designed for organizations having up to 50 people and the Basic profile of the ISO/IEC 29110 developed specifically for organizations having up to 25 people. The analysis of the academic programs showed a better coverage of ISO/IEC 29110 than MoProSoft. In this paper, these two standards are mapped to understand the results of the analysis in detail and provide recommendations regarding academic programs. The analysis provides an evidence that the processes of the Basic profile of ISO/IEC 29110 are better covered by the universities curricula because the processes provides the minimal set of practices to be performed while a project is executed from the beginning until the delivery of a software. In addition, this mapping presents a clear differentiation between these two standards that might help Software Development Centers to understand where to start in the implementation of one of them","authors":["Mirna Muñoz","Jezreel Mejia","Adriana Peña Pérez Negrón","Graciela Lara López"],"meta":["April 2019Computer Standards & Interfaces","DOI:10.1016/j.csi.2019.03.008"],"references":["322059955_Applying_Software_Engineering_Standards_in_Very_Small_Entities_From_Startups_to_Grownups","316688489_Software_Process_Improvement_Standards_and_Guides_for_Very_Small_Organizations_-_An_Overview_of_Eight_Implementations","316482446_Systems_Engineering_and_Management_Processes_for_Small_Organizations_with_ISOIEC_29110_-_An_Implementation_in_a_Small_Public_Transportation_Company","310898825_A_standard-based_framework_to_integrate_software_work_in_small_settings","310444837_The_evolution_of_the_ISOIEC_29110_set_of_standards_and_guides","304778603_Systems_and_Software_Engineering_Standards_for_Very_Small_Entities_Accomplishments_and_Overview_-_IEEE_Computer","296480237_Software_Process_Improvement_in_Very_Small_Organizations","320355343_ISOIEC_29110_and_curricula_programs_related_to_Computer_Science_and_Informatics_in_Mexico_Analysis_of_practices_coverage","304336400_Assessing_ISOIEC29110_by_means_of_ITMark_Results_from_an_experience_factory","287148546_Reinforcing_the_applicability_of_multi-model_environments_for_software_process_improvement_using_knowledge_management"]}
