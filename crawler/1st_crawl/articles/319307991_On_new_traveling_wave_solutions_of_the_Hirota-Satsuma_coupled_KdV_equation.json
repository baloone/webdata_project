{"id":"319307991_On_new_traveling_wave_solutions_of_the_Hirota-Satsuma_coupled_KdV_equation","abstract":"The improved (G'/G)-expansion method is applied to reach the di¤erent type soliton solitions of the Hirota-Satsuma Coupled KdV (HSCKdV) equation. It is obtained hyperbolic, triangular, periodic wave and kink soliton solitions of this equation. The method is an effective one to reach the di¤erent types of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations and systems. Finally, the numerical simulations add to these obtained solutions.","authors":["Ali Akgül","Mustafa Inc","M.Tuncay Gençoğlu"],"meta":["August 2017New Trends in Mathematical Sciences 3(5):262-272","DOI:10.20852/ntmsci.2017.201","Project: Matematik"],"references":["283020843_Conservation_laws_and_symmetries_of_MKDV-KP_equation","280302762_Soliton_solutions_to_coupled_nonlinear_wave_equations_in_2_1-dimensions","258395414_Approximate_Analytic_Solutions_of_Time-Fractional_Hirota-Satsuma_Coupled_KdV_Equation_and_Coupled_MKdV_Equation","257792288_Exact_solutions_for_Ostrovsky_equation","313617476_The_application_of_homotopy_analysis_method_to_solve_a_generalized_HirotaSatsuma_coupled_KdV_equation","311393904_Lie_symmetry_analysis_and_soliton_solutions_of_time-fractional_K_m_n_equation","307568271_On_black-scholes_equation_method_of_heir-equations_nonlinear_self-adjointness_and_conservation_laws","272200921_A_Novel_Analytical_Method_with_Fractional_Complex_Transform_for_New_Exact_Solutions_of_Time-Fractional_Fifth-Order_Sawada-Kotera_Equation","266238750_Application_of_Improved_G_'G-Expansion_Method_to_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_of_Two_Nonlinear_Evolution_Equations","257878660_A_new_fractional_sub-equation_method_for_fractional_partial_differential_equations"]}
