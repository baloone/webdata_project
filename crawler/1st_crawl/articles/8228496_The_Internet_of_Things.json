{"id":"8228496_The_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"The development of 'Internet-0' (I0) encoding which deals with the idea of extending the notion of internetworking to interdevice internetworking is discussed. Each I0 uses IP information which adds about 100 bits to each message and has a negligible impact on the response time and power requirements. I0 uses bits that are bigger than the network which allow the data that make up a packet to be represented in the same way no matter what physical medium conveys them. I0 is aimed at the scaling limits imposed by network complexity rather than raw performance. An I0 device depends on the current routers, gateways and name servers to carry packets between I0 subnetworks.","authors":["Neil Gershenfeld","Raffi Krikorian","Danny Cohen"],"meta":["November 2004Scientific American 291(4):76-81","DOI:10.1038/scientificamerican1004-76","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
