{"id":"262955217_Diffraction_algorithm_suitable_for_both_near_and_far_field_with_shifted_destination_window_and_oblique_illumination","abstract":"We propose a method for diffraction simulation with both shifted destination window and a large oblique illumination. Based on the angular spectrum theory, we first derive a generalized transfer function (GTF) and a generalized point-spread function (GSPF) suitable for free-space diffraction simulation when both a shifted destination window and a large oblique illumination are taken into account. Then we analyze the sampling error caused by sampling of the GTF and the GSPF for numerical simulation based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), and find out an analytical formula for determining a criteria distance of Z<sub>c</sub>. Theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the FFT-based GTF sampling algorithm is valid for diffraction simulation with a diffraction distance less than or equal to Z<sub>c</sub>, while the FFT-based GSPF sampling is only suitable for the simulation with a distance larger than or equal to Z<sub>c</sub>. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose the hybrid GTF-GSPF algorithm suitable for simulation of both near- and far-field diffractions with shifted destination window and large oblique source illumination at the same time. Finally, some simulation results are given to verify the feasibility of the algorithm.","authors":["Cheng-Shan Guo","Yi-Yan Xie","Bei Sha"],"meta":["March 2014Optics Letters 39(8)","DOI:10.1364/OL.39.002338"],"references":["278116248_Optical_transforms_in_digital_holography_-_art_no_625216","260375013_Lensless_phase_contrast_microscopy_based_on_multiwavelength_Fresnel_diffraction","258955259_Nonuniform_sampled_scalar_diffraction_calculation_using_nonuniform_fast_Fourier_transform","236739745_Computation_of_highly_off-axis_diffracted_fields_using_the_band-limited_angular_spectrum_method_with_suppressed_Gibbs_related_artifacts","236038101_Memory-efficient_reference_calculation_of_light_propagation_using_the_convolution_method","234070095_Fast_computation_of_Fresnel_diffraction_field_of_a_three-dimensional_object_for_a_pixelated_optical_device","232228820_Computation_of_diffracted_fields_for_the_case_of_high_numerical_aperture_using_the_angular_spectrum_method","227398806_Calculating_the_Fresnel_diffraction_of_light_from_a_shifted_and_tilted_plane","51057190_Direct_calculation_of_a_three-dimensional_diffracted_field","49782233_Reference_calculation_of_light_propagation_between_parallel_planes_of_different_sizes_and_sampling_rates","45709229_Shifted_angular_spectrum_method_for_off-axis_numerical_propagation","44852941_Lensfree_on-chip_microscopy_over_a_wide_field-of-view_using_pixel_super-resolution","40484001_Band-Limited_Angular_Spectrum_Method_for_Numerical_Simulation_of_Free-Space_Propagation_in_Far_and_Near_Fields","26273122_Angular_spectrum_method_with_correction_of_anamorphism_for_numerical_reconstruction_of_digital_holograms_on_tilted_planes","6880942_Fresnel_Coherent_Diffractive_Imaging","260152847_Lensless_zoomable_holographic_projection_using_scaled_Fresnel_diffraction","236188526_Band-limited_double-step_Fresnel_diffraction_and_its_application_to_computer-generated_holograms","233828411_Wide-window_angular_spectrum_method_for_diffraction_propagation_in_far_and_near_field","231741962_Scaled_angular_spectrum_method","51658614_Angular_spectrum_calculations_for_arbitrary_focal_length_with_a_scaled_convolution","49631204_Magnified_reconstruction_of_digitally_recorded_holograms_by_Fresnel-Bluestein_transform","26297994_Shifted_Fresnel_diffraction_for_computational_holography"]}
