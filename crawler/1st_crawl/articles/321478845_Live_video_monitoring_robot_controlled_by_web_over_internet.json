{"id":"321478845_Live_video_monitoring_robot_controlled_by_web_over_internet","abstract":"Future is all about robots, robot can perform tasks where humans cannot, Robots have huge applications in military and industrial area for lifting heavy weights, for accurate placements, for repeating the same task number of times, where human are not efficient. Generally robot is a mix of electronic, electrical and mechanical engineering and can do the tasks automatically on its own or under the supervision of humans. The camera is the eye for robot, call as robovision helps in monitoring security system and also can reach into the places where the human eye cannot reach. This paper presents about developing a live video streaming robot controlled from the website. We designed the web, controlling for the robot to move left, right, front and back while streaming video. As we move to the smart environment or IoT (Internet of Things) by smart devices the system we developed here connects over the internet and can be operated with smart mobile phone using a web browser. The Raspberry Pi model B chip acts as heart for this system robot, the sufficient motors, surveillance camera R pi 2 are connected to Raspberry pi.","authors":["M Lokanath","Guruju Akhil Sai"],"meta":["November 2017IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 263(5):052027","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/263/5/052027"],"references":["260584516_Eben_Upton_Raspberry_Pi","250305936_A_Novel_Equation_based_Classifier_for_Detecting_Human_in_Images","308861855_Pibot_The_raspberry_pi_controlled_multi-environment_robot_for_surveillance_live_streaming","272985229_Embedded_Real_Time_Video_Monitoring_System_using_Arm","266356911_The_Development_and_Applications_of_the_Remote_Real-Time_Video_Surveillance_System","223320297_Generating_octree_models_of_3D_objects_from_their_silhouettes_in_a_sequence_of_images"]}
