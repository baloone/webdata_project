{"id":"346975875_On_sharp_bounds_of_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Convex_Polytoes","abstract":"Let Ω be a connected graph and for a given l-ordered partition of vertices of a connected graph Ω is represented as β = {β1, β2, ... , βl}. The representation of a vertex μ ∈ V(Ω) is the vector r(μ|β) = (d(μ, β1), d(μ, β2), .. . , d(μ, βl)). The partition β is a resolving partition for vertices of Ω if all vertices of Ω having the unique representation with respect to β. The minimum number of l in the resolving partition for Ω is known as the partition dimension of Ω and represented as pd(Ω). Resolving partition and partition dimension have multipurpose applications in networking, optimization, computer, mastermind games and modeling of chemical structures. The problem of computing constant values of partition dimension is NP-hard so one can find sharp bound for the partition dimension of graph. In this article, we computed the upper bound for the convex polytopes En, Sn, Tn, Gn, Qn and flower graph fn×3.","authors":["Muhammad Azeem","Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","Faisal Nadeem"],"meta":["December 2020IEEE Access 8(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044498"],"references":["341645732_Further_new_results_on_strong_resolving_partitions_for_graphs","337443299_The_partition_dimension_of_subdivision_graph_on_the_star","334633156_Bounds_for_partition_dimension_of_M-wheels","326574158_On_partition_dimension_of_fullerene_graphs","321131484_On_the_partition_dimension_of_two-component_graphs","317391961_On_The_Partition_Dimension_of_C_m_P_n_Graph","307015217_Partition_dimension_of_honeycomb_derived_networks","264554734_On_the_partition_dimension_of_some_wheel_related_graphs","264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","262723554_Labelings_of_two_classes_of_convex_polytopes","236611635_On_the_partition_dimension_of_unicyclic_graphs","228983270_Some_polynomials_of_flower_graphs","220532702_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Cartesian_Products_of_Graphs","3236449_Network_Discovery_and_Verification","355389937_Partition_dimension_and_strong_metric_dimension_of_chain_cycle","345181525_The_Local_Partition_Dimension_of_Graphs","341363848_Partition_Dimension_of_Complete_Multipartite_Graph","341093777_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Rotationally_Symmetric_and_Planar_Networks","327910718_On_the_k-partition_dimension_of_graphs","319861713_The_partition_dimension_of_circulant_graphs","317770175_On_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Circulant_Graphs","284229630_Browsable_structure-activity_datasets","277774195_ON_THREE_FAMILIES_OF_GRAPHS_WITH_CONSTANT_METRIC_DIMENSION","271153664_PGarey_Michael_R_and_Johnson_David_S_Computers_and_intractability_A_guide_to_the_theory_of_NP-completeness_W_H_Freeman_and_Company_San_Francisco_1979_x_338_pp","267067206_The_theory_and_applications_of_resolvability_in_graphs_A_survey","265443592_Dominating_and_reference_sets_in_a_graph","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","250686251_The_partition_dimension_of_a_graph","233844549_A_note_on_the_partition_dimension_of_Cartesian_product_graphs","226705873_On_k-dimensional_graphs_and_their_bases","225153650_Mastermind","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220632415_Metric_bases_in_digital_geometry","220513592_On_families_of_convex_polytopes_with_constant_metric_dimension","51948452_On_the_partition_dimension_of_trees","14979686_Structure-activity_maps_for_visualizing_the_graph_variables_arising_in_drug_design"]}
