{"id":"324717657_A_Coinductive_Approach_to_Proving_Reachability_Properties_in_Logically_Constrained_Term_Rewriting_Systems","abstract":"We introduce a sound and complete coinductive proof system for reachability properties in transition systems generated by logically constrained term rewriting rules over an order-sorted signature modulo builtins. A key feature of the calculus is a circularity proof rule, which allows to obtain finite representations of the infinite coinductive proofs.","authors":["Ştefan Ciobâcă","Dorel Lucanu"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["317354108_Verifying_Procedural_Programs_via_Constrained_Rewriting_Induction","305483785_A_Generic_Framework_for_Symbolic_Execution_A_Coinductive_Approach","300302956_Constrained_Term_Rewriting_tooL","325989746_Unification_Modulo_Builtins","320360867_Conditional_narrowing_modulo_SMT_and_axioms","319875764_A_Constructor-Based_Reachability_Logic_for_Rewrite_Theories","319696358_Guarded_Terms_for_Rewriting_Modulo_SMT","310823795_Semantics-based_program_verifiers_for_all_languages","309184065_Rewriting_modulo_SMT_and_open_system_analysis","303912890_Built-in_Variant_Generation_and_Unification_and_Their_Applications_in_Maude_27"]}
