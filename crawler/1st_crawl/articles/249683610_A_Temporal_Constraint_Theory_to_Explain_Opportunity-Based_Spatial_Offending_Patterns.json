{"id":"249683610_A_Temporal_Constraint_Theory_to_Explain_Opportunity-Based_Spatial_Offending_Patterns","abstract":"This article will examine the evidence supporting the notion that a proportion of offending is driven by the availability of opportunities presented in the routine activities of offenders’ lives. It then proceeds to summarize Miller’s time measurement theory in order to describe a basic language with which to discuss the movement of people through time and space. Armed with a notation for space-time interactions, the article explores the criminological implications of temporal constraints as a mechanism to explain a number of key concepts from environmental criminology. It is hypothesized here that the temporal constraints of daily life are the main cause of unfamiliarity with areas beyond the offender’s immediate least-distance path. As a result, temporal constraints, in conjunction with the locations of offender nodes, are a major determinant in spatio-temporal patterns of property crime.","authors":["Jerry H.
