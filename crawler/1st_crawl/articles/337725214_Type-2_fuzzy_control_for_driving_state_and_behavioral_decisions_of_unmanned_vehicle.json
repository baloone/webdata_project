{"id":"337725214_Type-2_fuzzy_control_for_driving_state_and_behavioral_decisions_of_unmanned_vehicle","abstract":"In this paper, interval type-2 fuzzy sets, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and the fuzzy control rules are synthesized to realize the control of unmanned vehicle in driving state and behavioral decisions. Compared to the type-1 fuzzy set, type-2 fuzzy sets have more advantages in handling the model based on uncertainties, linguistic information because the membership functions are fuzzy sets. Different membership functions are established for each factor when the unmanned vehicle is driving at different speed intervals. In addition, a new evaluation method is developed to analyze unmanned vehicleʼ s driving state. Finally, a set of dynamic fuzzy rules are sorted out, which can be applied to the unmanned vehicleʼ s behavioral decision-making and provide a new idea to related research.","authors":["Xuanming Zhao","Hong Mo","Kefu Yan","Lingxi Li"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica PP(99):1-9","DOI:10.1109/JAS.2019.1911810"],"references":[]}
