{"id":"314244832_Enabling_internet_banking_adoption_An_empirical_examination_with_an_augmented_technology_acceptance_model_TAM","abstract":"Purpose\nThe integration of relevant antecedents into TAM would lead to better understanding of the decision factors which act as enablers for the adoption of internet banking. The purpose of the paper is to determine the influence of the antecedents subjective norm, image, banks initiative, internet banking self-efficacy, internet usage efficacy, trust, perceived risk, trialability and government support on the existing constructs of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and to test measurement invariance and the moderating effect of the demographic variables on the relationship between the latent constructs used in this augmented TAM.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA survey questionnaire was administered on internet banking users and a total of 300 responses were collected. A two-step approach suggested by Hair et al. (2006) and Schumacker and Lomax (2004) was used in this study. The proposed model was assessed using the confirmatory factor analysis approach. The structural model was then tested in order to establish nomological validity. The data based on four demographic dimensions gender, age, income, education were divided into two groups for each of these demographic dimensions. The invariance test was first performed on the measurement model and then on the structural model. The measurement model and structural model were subjected to tests of equivalence of parameters across groups.\n\nFindings\nTo a large extent the results of the study supports the proposed model and thereby contributes to understand the influence of subjective norm, image, banks initiative, internet banking self-efficacy, internet usage efficacy, trust, perceived risk and government support on internet banking adoption. The predictor variables in the augmented TAM were able to explain 29.9 per cent of the variance in the actual usage of internet banking as compared to the TAM which was able to explain only 26.5 per cent variance in the actual usage of internet banking. A significant difference in the relationship between the different constructs of the model was observed when the model was subjected to multi-group invariance testing.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study suffers from the same limitations as most other studies involving TAM. In this study self-reported measures about the usage were taken as the actual usage. The findings of the study can be of use to marketers for target-specific marketing by customizing the marketing campaign focussing on the factors that were found to be strong influencers leading to the usage of internet banking for each target audience.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe main challenge in this study was to develop the conceptual model for the internet banking adoption by extending the TAM and to get a robust theoretical support from the extant literature for the relevant factors along with their relationship to uncover new insights about factors responsible for the internet banking adoption. The augmented model had an improved predictive capability and explanatory utility.","authors":["Bijith Marakarkandy","Nilay Yajnik","Chandan Dasgupta"],"meta":["March 2017Journal of Enterprise
