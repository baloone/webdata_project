{"id":"301335377_DanQ_A_hybrid_convolutional_and_recurrent_deep_neural_network_for_quantifying_the_function_of_DNA_sequences","abstract":"Modeling the properties and functions of DNA sequences is an important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics.\nThis task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of\nfunction. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science\nand translational research because over 98% of the human genome is non-coding and 93% of disease-associated variants lie in\nthese regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory\nrecurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term\ndependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory ‘grammar’ to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably\nupon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50% relative improvement in\nthe area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models. We have made the source code available at the\ngithub repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.","authors":["Daniel Quang","Xiaohui Xie"],"meta":["April 2016Nucleic Acids Research 44(11):gkw226","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkw226"],"references":["301872310_Co-occurrence_Feature_Learning_for_Skeleton_based_Action_Recognition_using_Regularized_Deep_LSTM_Networks","283748925_Co-occurrence_Feature_Learning_for_Skeleton_based_Action_Recognition_using_Regularized_Deep_LSTM_Networks","283748673_Co-occurrence_Feature_Learning_for_Skeleton_based_Action_Recognition_using_Regularized_Deep_LSTM_Networks","283502053_JASPAR_2016_A_major_expansion_and_update_of_the_open-access_database_of_transcription_factor_binding_profiles","313189498_Integrative_analysis_of_111_reference_human_epigenomes","303256841_Theano_a_CPU_and_GPU_math_expression_compiler","294424770_Gene_expression_inference_with_deep_learning","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286271944_On_the_importance_of_initialization_and_momentum_in_deep_learning","284801616_An_integrated_map_of_genetic_variation_from_1"]}
