{"id":"331435261_On_the_distribution_of_queue_length_in_ideal_links","abstract":"We consider an ideal link with bounded, independent, and identically distributed stochastic arrival and capacity processes. We use the theory of effective bandwidth and the theory of generating functions to improve known results about the queue process. Specifically, we prove better bounds on the probability distribution function and the tail distribution function of queue lengths.","authors":["Jakub Daubner","Martin Klimo","Jozef Papan","Juraj Smie≈°ko"],"meta":["February 2019Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience 32(5)","DOI:10.1002/cpe.5203"],"references":["325361731_How_to_deal_with_QoS_value_constraints_in_MCDM_based_Web_service_selection","319593091_Large_Deviations","319347730_Network_failure-aware_redundant_virtual_machine_placement_in_a_cloud_data_center","312334356_The_Survey_of_Current_IPFRR_Mechanisms","312038522_The_IPFRR_mechanism_inspired_by_BIER_algorithm","303598317_A_New_Fast_Backup_Method_for_Bidirectional_Multicast_Traffic_in_MPLS_Networks_Control_Plane_Procedures_and_Evaluation_by_Simulations","301238889_Loop-Free_Alternates_with_Loop_Detection_for_Fast_Reroute_in_Software-Defined_Carrier_and_Data_Center_Networks","300762870_Survivability_and_Fault_Tolerance_in_the_Cloud","281740579_Analysis_of_existing_IP_Fast_Reroute_mechanisms","278145343_Self-configuring_loop-free_alternates_with_high_link_failure_coverage","277594585_Future_research_directions_in_design_of_reliable_communication_systems","274403958_Cost_of_loop-free_alternates_in_IP-over-WDM_networks","273698755_Mobility_management_solutions_for_current_IP_and_future_networks","270754008_Resilient_Network_Design_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","261056717_Performance_evaluation_of_Multiple_Routing_Configurations","326431446_bQueue_A_Coarse-Grained_Bucket_QoS_Scheduler","324424212_Reversibility_and_Stochastic_Networks","324378294_Large_Deviation_Techniques_in_Decision_Simulation_and_Estimation","324373283_Reversibility_and_Stochastic_Networks","322504443_Development_of_Wireless_LAN_Base_Station_with_QoS_Control_Based_on_Web-QoE_by_Bandwidth_Control_and_Priority_Control","322001888_A_deterministic_network_calculus_enabled_QoS_routing_on_software_defined_network","321568396_Entropy_Large_Deviations_and_Statistical_Mechanics","321520916_Performance_Guarantees_in_Communication_Networks","321412562_Development_of_Wireless_LAN_Base_Station_with_QoS_Control_Based_on_Web-QoE_by_Bandwidth_Control_and_Priority_Control","319929151_Improvement_of_flow-oriented_fast_reroute_model_based_on_scalable_protection_solutions_for_telecommunication_network_elements","318667725_Performance_comparison_of_resilience_mechanisms_for_stateless_multicast_using_BIER","316535121_Mathematical_Evaluation_of_Context_Transfer_and_Multicast_Fast_Reroute_in_Multicast_Enabled_Network_Mobility_Management","311953010_A_Fault-Tolerant_Routing_Strategy_for_KNS_Topologies_Based_on_Intermediate_Nodes","304457772_Multiple_Routing_Configurations_for_Fast_Re-route_in_Software_Defined_Networks","287973356_Routing_Optimization_for_IP_Networks_with_Loop-Free_Alternates","283524593_A_framework_for_fast_IP_rerouting","276886510_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_Tandem_Queueing_Systems_Using_Network_Calculus","271740769_A_hybrid_rerouting_scheme","271619643_Optimization_methods_for_improving_IP-level_fast_protection_for_local_shared_risk_groups_with_Loop-Free_Alternates","271512870_Large_deviations_techniques_and_their_applications","269302573_Fast_rerouting_for_IP_multicast_under_single_node_failures","269298264_IP_Fast_Rerouting_for_Multi-Link_Failures","268189745_Discussion_on_the_combination_of_Loop-Free_Alternates_and_Maximally_Redundant_Trees_for_IP_networks_Fast_Reroute","268054645_Sur_un_nouveau_theoreme_de_la_theorie_des_probabilites","265666384_On_Large_Deviations_from_the_Invariant_Measure","261469825_A_simple_IP_fast_reroute_scheme_for_full_coverage","259292050_Convergence_Time_Analysis_of_Open_Shortest_Path_First_Routing_Protocol_in_Internet_Scale_Networks","257175333_On_Providing_Fast_Protection_with_Remote_Loop-Free_Alternates_-_Analyzing_and_Optimizing_Unit_Cost_Networks","251991348_Investigation_of_Fast_Reroute_mechanisms_in_an_optical_testbed_environment","251399467_Fast_reroute_paths_algorithms","247289599_Protocol_Independent_Multicast_-_Dense_Mode_PIM-DM_Protocol_Specification_Revised","243613306_Stochastic_Networks_Theory_and_Applications","242617365_Large_Deviations_and_Statistical_Mechanics_Springer_New_York","242530134_A_calculus_for_network_delay","242356850_On_probability_of_large_deviations_of_random_variables","241055724_Packet_loss_reduction_during_rerouting_using_network_traffic_analysis","234780708_Network_Calculus_A_Theory_of_Deterministic_Queuing_Systems_for_the_Internet","220955489_An_overview_of_the_OMNeT_simulation_environment","228017356_Statistical_Multiplexing","223364255_Loop-free_alternates_and_not-via_addresses_A_proper_combination_for_IP_fast_reroute"]}
