{"id":"319186154_Constructing_and_Exploring_Triangles_with_GeoGebra","abstract":"We look at a new approach to mathematical constructions. Using GeoGebra, we first do dynamic analysis and exploration. Again with GeoGebra, we then do a strict compass and straightedge constructions. Finally and yet again with GeoGebra, we do dynamic testing and discussion of proof. In this paper, we work through a complete example of construction a triangle and discuss our results of using this method in the classroom.","authors":["Zoran Trifunov"],"meta":["September 2010","Project: Constructing and Exploring Triangles with GeoGebra"],"references":[]}
