{"id":"347432108_Overlap_Training_to_Mitigate_Inconsistencies_Caused_by_Image_Tiling_in_CNNs","abstract":"This paper focuses on the problem of inconsistent predictions of modern convolutional neural networks (CNN) at patch (i.e. sub-image) boundaries. Limited by the graphics processing unit (GPU) resources, image tiling and stitching countermeasure have been applied for most megapixel images, that is, cutting images into overlapping tiles as CNN input, and then stitching CNN outputs together. However, we found that stitched (i.e. recovered) predictions have discontinuous grid-like noise. We propose a simple yet efficient overlap training framework to mitigate the inconsistent prediction at patch boundaries without changing the model architecture while improving the stability, robustness of the model. We have applied our solution to various CNNs (such as U-Net, DeepLab, RCF) and tested them on two real-world datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that the new framework is sufficient in reducing inconsistency and outperform these countermeasures.
