{"id":"257674874_Effect_of_Channel_Estimation_Error_on_Time_Reversal_UWB_Communication_System","abstract":"In this paper, effects of channel estimation error on time reversal (TR) UWB systems are investigated. In time reversal, a signal is prefiltered by using a time reversed complex conjugate of the channel impulse response as a transmitter prefilter. To investigate the effect of channel estimation error, an error function is added to TR-UWB prefilter. Analytical and simulation results show that channel estimation error degrade the performance. The signal-to-interference plus noise ratio decreases with increasing error variance. It is shown that the channel performance is degraded about 0.5 dB in CM1 and 1.3 dB in CM4 channel.","authors":["Dariush Abbasi-Moghadam","Vahid Tabataba Vakili"],"meta":["January 2013Wireless Personal Communications 68(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-011-0460-y"],"references":["237813751_Ultra_Wideband_UWB_Transceiver_Design_Using_Channel_Phase_Precoding_CPP","3320352_Ultrawideband_Transceiver_Design_Using_Channel_Phase_Precoding","220548189_Characterization_of_indoor_time_reversal_UWB_communication_systems_Spatial_temporal_and_frequency_properties","220545352_Channel_characterization_of_time_reversal_UWB_communication_systems_Annals_of_Telecommunications_659-10_601-614","3156849_Statistical_Analysis_of_UWB_Channel_Correlation_Functions"]}
