{"id":"259312606_Quantum_F_un_the_q1_Limit_of_Galois_Field_Quantum_Mechanics_Projective_Geometry_and_the_Field_with_One_Element","abstract":"We argue that the q=1 limit of Galois Field Quantum Mechanics, which was\nconstructed on a vector space over the Galois Field F_q=GF(q), corresponds to\nits `classical limit,' where superposition of states is disallowed. The limit\npreserves the projective geometry nature of the state space, and can be\nunderstood as being constructed on an appropriately defined analogue of a\n`vector' space over the `field with one element' F_1.","authors":["Lay Chang","Zachary Lewis","Djordje Minic","Tatsu Takeuchi"],"meta":["December 2013Journal of Physics A Mathematical and Theoretical 47(40)","DOI:10.1088/1751-8113/47/40/405304","SourcearXiv"],"references":["325448561_Combinatorics_Topics_Techniques_Algorithms","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","322875654_Projective_Geometry_over_pig_1_and_the_Gaussian_Binomial_Coefficients","298995764_Zeta_functions_over_F-1","291480530_Quasi-cassical_teory_of_the_spinning_electron","290108344_Hxp_and_the_Riemann_Zeros","288606824_double-struck_F_sign1-schemes_and_toric_varieties","282056647_Les_Varietes_sur_le_Corps_a_un_Element","281696079_Algebre_Absolue","280780739_Decoherence_and_the_transition_from_quantum_to_classical_-_Revisited"]}
