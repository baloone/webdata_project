{"id":"45892963_Asymptotic_variance_of_random_symmetric_digital_search_trees","abstract":"Dedicated to the 60th birthday of Philippe Flajolet\nInternational audience\nAsymptotics of the variances of many cost measures in random digital search trees are often notoriously messy and involved to obtain. A new approach is proposed to facilitate such an analysis for several shape parameters on random symmetric digital search trees. Our approach starts from a more careful normalization at the level of Poisson generating functions, which then provides an asymptotically equivalent approximation to the variance in question. Several new ingredients are also introduced such as a combined use of the Laplace and Mellin transforms and a simple, mechanical technique for justifying the analytic de-Poissonization procedures involved. The methodology we develop can be easily adapted to many other problems with an underlying binomial distribution. In particular, the less expected and somewhat surprising n (logn)(2)-variance for certain notions of total path-length is also clarified.","authors":["Hsien-Kuei Hwang","Michael Fuchs","Vytas Zacharovas"],"meta":["December 2009Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 12(2)","DOI:10.46298/dmtcs.498","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319587330_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","319321979_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","270970552_XV-The_Correlation_between_Relatives_on_the_Supposition_of_Mendelian_Inheritance","270759595_Ramanujan's_Notebooks_Part_I","267120942_Random_trees_An_interplay_between_combinatorics_and_probability","266939839_Digital_search_trees_revisited","265543808_Eine_Anwendung_der_Theorie_der_Modulfunktionen_in_der_Informatik_An_application_of_the_theory_of_modular_functions_in_computer_science","265422087_A_course_of_modern_analysis_An_introduction_to_the_general_theory_of_infinite_processes_and_of_analytic_functions_with_an_account_of_the_principal_transcendental_functions_Third_edition","244966873_A_note_on_growing_binary_trees","243768150_Paths_in_a_Random_Digital_Tree_Limiting_Distributions"]}
