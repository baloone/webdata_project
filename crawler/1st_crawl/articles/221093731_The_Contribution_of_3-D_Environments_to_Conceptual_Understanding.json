{"id":"221093731_The_Contribution_of_3-D_Environments_to_Conceptual_Understanding","abstract":"This paper explores the potential learning benefits of 3D Learning Environments (3DLEs). It presents definitions of key terms and analyses the learner-computer interactions facilitated by 3DLEs, in order to identify the unique characteristics of such environments It is argued that the most important potential contribution of 3DLEs to conceptual understanding is through facilitation of spatial knowledge development. The effectiveness of 3DLEs for spatial learning is discussed, drawing on literature from a range of disciplines. Aspects of a research agenda are identified including exploration of the characteristics of 3DLEs that are most important for spatial learning along with issues in designing appropriate learning tasks.","authors":["Barney Dalgarno","John Hedberg","Barry Harper"],"meta":["January 2002","SourceDBLP","Conference: Winds of Changing in the Sea of Learning, Proceedings of the 19th Annual Conference of the Australian Society for Computers in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE), Auckland, New Zealand, 8-11 December 2002"],"references":["316095446_Spatial_Cognition_in_virtual_environment_Spatial_cognition_in_video_games","251442609_What_is_the_Value_of_Virtual_Reality_for_Conceptual_Learning_Towards_a_Theoretical_Framework","236964257_Perceiving_layout_and_knowing_distances_The_interaction_relative_potency_and_contextual_use_of_different_information_about_depth","226771428_Design_of_Virtual_Reality_Systems_for_Education_A_Cognitive_Approach","222272664_What_does_virtual_reality_NEED_Human_factors_issues_in_the_design_of_three-dimensional_computer_environments","220089548_The_Transfer_of_Spatial_Knowledge_in_Virtual_Environment_Training","281151499_Navigating_Buildings_in_Desk-Top_Virtual_Environments_Experimental_Investigations_Using_Extended_Navigational_Experience","238750552_Objectivism_versus_constructivism_do_we_need_a_new_philosophical_paradigm_educational_technology_research_development","234707542_Virtual_Reality_Toward_Fundamental_Improvements_in_Simulation-Based_Training","220107475_Virtual_spaces_and_real_world_places_Transfer_of_route_knowledge"]}
