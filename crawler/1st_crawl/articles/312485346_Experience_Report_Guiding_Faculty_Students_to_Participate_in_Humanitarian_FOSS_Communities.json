{"id":"312485346_Experience_Report_Guiding_Faculty_Students_to_Participate_in_Humanitarian_FOSS_Communities","abstract":"Students in computer science (CS) and related disciplines must master content knowledge and skills as well as process skills including communication, critical thinking, problem solving, and teamwork. Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) projects provide opportunities for students to contribute to real software systems and participate in diverse communities, helping students to master both content and process skills. Humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS) projects address social needs, and appeal to many students. However, FOSS can present challenges for students and teachers. To address these challenges, faculty use evidence-based approaches, including Team Project Based Learning (TPBL) and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). This paper describes the redesign of a set of workshop sessions to help faculty learn about HFOSS principles and communities, and how to use HFOSS, TPBL, and POGIL in their own classrooms.","authors":["Clif Kussmaul"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/T4E.2016.054","Conference: 2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)"],"references":["282298917_Lessons_Learned_From_Teaching_Open_Source_Software_Development","262388917_Cooperative_Learning_Instructional_Methods_for_CS1_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation","254049397_How_to_involve_students_in_FOSS_projects","247935033_IS_2010_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Information_Systems","221538889_FOSS_101_Engaging_introductory_students_in_the_open_source_movement","221368301_Holistic_Software_Engineering_Education_Based_on_a_Humanitarian_Open_Source_Project","220789977_Process_Oriented_Guided_Inquiry_Learning_for_Soft_Computing","24312096_Pedagogies_of_engagement_in_science_a_comparison_of_PBL_POGIL_and_PLTL","321600639_Computer_Science_Project_Work_Principles_and_Pragmatics","312940406_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","305082026_Results_from_a_Survey_of_Faculty_Adoption_of_Process_Oriented_Guided_Inquiry_Learning_POGIL_in_Computer_Science","300116169_A_Multi-Institutional_Study_of_Learning_via_Student_Involvement_in_Humanitarian_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_Projects","285178383_A_Multi-Institutional_Assessment_of_the_Use_of_POGIL_in_Organic_Chemistry","284498106_Process-oriented_guided_inquiry_learning_POGIL_and_the_POGIL_project","284349485_Instruction_in_software_project_communication_through_guided_inquiry_and_reflection","283778416_Software_engineering_learning_in_HFOSS_A_multi-institutional_study","274265177_Active_Learning_in_a_Math_for_Liberal_Arts_Classroom","262205318_Using_POGIL_to_help_students_learn_to_program","261311817_Towards_a_model_of_faculty_development_for_FOSS_in_education","255577531_Instructor's_Guide_to_Process-Oriented_Guided-Inquiry_Learning","254006656_50_ways_to_be_a_FOSSer_simple_ways_to_involve_students_faculty_abstract_only","242703498_tional_Leadership_of_the_ASSOCIATION_for_SUPERVISION_and_CURRICULUM_DEVEIOPMENT_NEA","241623972_An_approach_for_evaluating_FOSS_projects_for_student_participation","234633049_Toward_a_Multicultural_Ecology_of_Teaching_and_Learning_A_Critical_Review_of_Theory_and_Research","232808426_Stories_of_Change_How_Educators_Change_Their_Practice","231264758_A_Guided-Inquiry_General_Chemistry_Course","230289449_Facilitating_Change_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Instructional_Practices_An_Analytic_Review_of_the_Literature","229049676_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_an_Open_Source_Software_Development_Course","228900655_A_Course_in_Open_Source_Development","225427162_What_is_the_best_way_to_achieve_broader_reach_of_improved_practices_in_higher_education","224088844_Work_in_progress_-_use_of_guided_inquiry_as_an_active_learning_technique_in_engineering"]}
