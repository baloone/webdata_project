{"id":"319134131_K-8_Learning_Trajectories_Derived_from_Research_Literature_Sequence_Repetition_Conditionals","abstract":"Computing curricula are being developed for elementary school classrooms, yet research evidence is scant for learning trajectories that drive curricular decisions about what topics should be addressed at each grade level, at what depth, and in what order. This study presents learning trajectories based on an in-depth review of over 100 scholarly articles in computer science education research. We present three levels of results. First, we present the characteristics of the 600+ learning goals and their research context that affected the learning trajectory creation process. Second, we describe our first three learning trajectories (Sequence, Repetition, and Conditionals), and the relationship between the learning goals and the resulting trajectories. Finally, we discuss the ways in which assumptions about the context (mathematics) and language (e.g., Scratch) directly influenced the trajectories.","authors":["Kathryn M.
