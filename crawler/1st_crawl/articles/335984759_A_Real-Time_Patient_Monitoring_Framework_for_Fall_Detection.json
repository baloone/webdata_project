{"id":"335984759_A_Real-Time_Patient_Monitoring_Framework_for_Fall_Detection","abstract":"Fall detection is a major problem in the healthcare department. Elderly people are more prone to fall than others. There are more than 50% of injury-related hospitalizations in people aged over 65. Commercial fall detection devices are expensive and charge a monthly fee for their services. A more affordable and adaptable system is necessary for retirement homes and clinics to build a smart city powered by IoT and artificial intelligence. An effective fall detection system would detect a fall and send an alarm to the appropriate authorities. We propose a framework that uses edge computing where instead of sending data to the cloud, wearable devices send data to a nearby edge device like a laptop or mobile device for real-time analysis. We use cheap wearable sensor devices from MbientLab, an open source streaming engine called Apache Flink for streaming data analytics, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network model for fall classification. The model is trained using a published dataset called “MobiAct.” Using the trained model, we analyse optimal sampling rates, sensor placement, and multistream data correction. Our edge computing framework can perform real-time streaming data analytics to detect falls with an accuracy of 95.8%.","authors":["Dharmitha Ajerla","Sazia Mahfuz","Farhana H.
