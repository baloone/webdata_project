Now a day’s Euler graph got height of\nachievement in many situations that occur in\ncomputer science, physical science, communication\nscience, economics and many other areas can be\nanalysed by using techniques found in a relatively\nnew area of mathematics. The graphs concerns\nrelationship with lines and points (nodes). The\nEuler graph can be used to represent almost any\nproblem involving discrete arrangements of objects\nwhere concern is not with the internal properties of\nthese objects but with relationship among them.\nTo achieve objective I first study basic concepts of\ngraph theory, after that I summarizes the methods\nthat are adopted to find Euler path and Euler cycle.\nKeywords:- graph theory, Konigsberg bridge\nproblem, Eulerian circuit.","authors":["Ashish Kumar"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.14445/22315373/IJMTT-V43P503"],"references":["255670644_SOME_APPLICATIONS_OF_EULERIAN_GRAPHS","221663696_Large_Feedback_Arc_Sets_High_Minimum_Degree_Subgraphs_and_Long_Cycles_in_Eulerian_Digraphs","27361094_A_Proof_of_Some_Schutzenberger-Type_Results_for_Eulerian_Paths_and_Circuits_on_Digraphs","267166931_A_cycle_decomposition_conjecture_for_Eulerian_graphs","265564221_On_the_number_of_Euler_trails_in_directed_graphs","244879550_Euler_cycles_in_the_complete_graph_K2m1","242122516_Determination_of_Hamiltonian_Circuit_and_Euler_Trail_from_a_Given_Graphic_Degree_Sequence","220639688_Traversing_Directed_Eulerian_Mazes","220078185_Disjoint_Cycles_in_Eulerian_Digraphs_and_the_Diameter_of_Interchange_Graphs","220074221_Quasigroups_defining_Eulerian_paths_in_complete_graphs"]}
