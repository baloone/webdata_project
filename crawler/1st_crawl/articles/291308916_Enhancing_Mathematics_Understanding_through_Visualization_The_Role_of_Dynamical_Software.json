{"id":"291308916_Enhancing_Mathematics_Understanding_through_Visualization_The_Role_of_Dynamical_Software","abstract":"Mathematics is, by its very nature, an abstract discipline. However, many students learn best by thinking in terms of tangible constructs. Enhancing Mathematics Understanding through Visualization: The Role of Dynamical Software brings these conflicting viewpoints together by offering visual representations as a method of mathematics instruction. The book explores the role of technology in providing access to multiple representations of concepts, using software applications to create a rich environment in which a student's understanding of mathematical concepts can flourish. Both students and instructors of mathematics at the university level will use this book to implement various novel techniques for the delivery of mathematical concepts in their classrooms. This book is part of the Research Essential collection.","authors":["Samer Habre"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-4050-4","Project: Book Editor"],"references":[]}
