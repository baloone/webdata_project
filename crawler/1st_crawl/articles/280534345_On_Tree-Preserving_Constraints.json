{"id":"280534345_On_Tree-Preserving_Constraints","abstract":"Tree convex constraints are extensions of the well-known row\nconvex constraints. Just like the latter, every path-consistent tree convex\nconstraint network is globally consistent. This paper studies and compares\nthree subclasses of tree convex constraints which are called chain-,\npath- and tree-preserving constraints respectively. While the tractability\nof the subclass of chain-preserving constraints has been established\nbefore, this paper shows that every chain- or path-preserving constraint\nnetwork is in essence the disjoint union of several independent connected\nrow convex constraint networks, and hence (re-)establish the tractability\nof these two subclasses of tree convex constraints. We further prove that,\nwhen enforcing arc- and path-consistency on a tree-preserving constraint\nnetwork, in each step, the network remains tree-preserving. This ensures\nthe global consistency of the tree-preserving network if no inconsistency\nis detected. Moreover, it also guarantees the applicability of the partial\npath-consistency algorithm to tree-preserving constraint networks,\nwhich is usually more efficient than the path-consistency algorithm for\nlarge sparse networks. As an application, we show that the class of treepreserving\nconstraints is useful in solving the scene labelling problem.","authors":["Shufeng Kong","Sanjiang Li","Yongming li","Zhiguo Long"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23219-5","Conference: 21st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2015)"],"references":["222630004_Constraints_consistency_and_closure","221605891_Consistency_and_Set_Intersection","220617670_The_Computational_Structure_of_Monotone_Monadic_SNP_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_A_Study_Through_Datalog_and_Group_Theory","262294715_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_Solvable_by_Local_Consistency_Methods","256660085_Qualitative_constraint_satisfaction_problems_An_extended_framework_with_landmarks","242636505_Impossible_Objects_as_nonsense_sentences","223536598_Temporal_Constraint_Networks","221603621_Simple_Randomized_Algorithms_for_Tractable_Row_and_Tree_Convex_Constraints","220546893_Properties_of_tree_convex_constraints","220546418_Solving_connected_row_convex_constraints_by_variable_elimination","220432180_A_Sufficient_Condition_for_Backtrack-Free_Search","220312642_Networks_of_Constraints_Fundamental_Properties_and_Applications_to_Picture_Processing","220269198_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Structured_Item_Graphs","37597089_Synthesizing_Constraint_Expressions","4355075_The_complexity_of_recognizing_polyhedral_scenes"]}
