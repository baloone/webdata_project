This study is mixed method research with classroom action research for its design. Data analysis is with one-way ANOVA for creative mathematical thinking abil-ity, t-test for self- confidence survey, qualitative analysis for observation and in-terviews on the self-confidence of grade VII junior high school students in Sumedang, Indonesia. Integration of e-learning into Resource-Based Learning method produced a better enhancement in mathematical creative thinking ability and self-confidence development in comparison to learning without learning. The scientific approach contributed positive influence on students’ learning achievement. Creative mathematical thinking ability showed increases from one cycle. Analysis of mathematical creative thinking ability covered aspect of fluen-cy, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. The post-test result showed lower achievement in comparison to test result of the final learning cycle.","authors":["Poppy Yaniawati","Rahayu Kariadinata","Nenden Mutiara Sari","Euis Eka Pramiarsih"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 15(06):60","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v15i06.11915"],"references":["332196787_Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder_A_Pathology_of_Self-Confidence","319696823_The_implementation_of_GeoGebra_software-assited_DDFC_instructional_model_for_improving_students'_Van-Hiele_geometry_thinking_skll","317961454_Barriers_Effecting_Successful_Implementation_of_E-Learning_in_Saudi_Arabian_Universities","316218447_Video_lectures_in_e-learning_Effects_of_viewership_and_media_diversity_on_learning_satisfaction_engagement_interest_and_future_behavioral_intention","287545376_E-Learning_to_Improve_Higher_Order_Thinking_Skills_HOTS_of_Students","330562660_PENELITIAN_TINDAKAN_KELAS","328105405_Developing_Self-confidence_How_to_manage_stress_and_develop_resilience","319708938_Peranan_Teknologi_Informasi_dalam_Pengembangan_E-Learning_pada_Fakultas_Mipa_di_Indonesia","311895577_HUBUNGAN_ANTARA_SELF-CONCEPT_TERHADAP_MATEMATIKA_DENGAN_KEMAMPUAN_BERPIKIR_KREATIF_MATEMATIK_SISWA","280837228_Cognitive_presence_in_virtual_collaborative_learning_Assessing_and_improving_critical_thinking_in_online_discussion_forums"]}
