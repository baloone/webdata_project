{"id":"309618324_Bi-BCM_A_Closed-Form_Solution_for_Fixed-Guided_Beams_in_Compliant_Mechanisms","abstract":"A fixed-guided beam, with one end is fixed while the other is guided in that the angle of that end does not change, is one of most commonly used flexible segments in compliant mechanisms such as bistable mechanisms, compliant parallelogram mechanisms, compound compliant parallelogram mechanisms and thermomechanical in-plane microactuators. In this paper, we split a fixed-guided beam into two elements, formulate each element using the Beam Constraint Model (BCM) equations, and then assemble the two elements' equations to obtain the final solution for the load-deflection relations. Interestingly, the resulting load-deflection solution (referred to as Bi-BCM) is closed-form, in which the tip loads are expressed as functions of the tip deflections. The maximum allowable axial force of Bi-BCM is the quadruple of that of BCM. Bi-BCM also extends the capability of BCM for predicting the second mode bending of fixed-guided beams. Besides, the boundary line between the first and the second modes bending of fixed-guided beams can be easily obtained using a closed-form equation. Bi-BCM can be immediately used for quick design calculations of compliant mechanisms utilizing fixed-guided beams as their flexible segments (generally no iteration is required). Different examples are analyzed to illustrate the usage of Bi-BCM, and the results show the effectiveness of the closed-form solution.","authors":["Ma Fulei","Guimin Chen"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics 9(1)","DOI:10.1115/1.4035084"],"references":["295263127_Beam_Constraint_Model_Generalized_Nonlinear_Closed-form_Modeling_of_Beam_Flexures_for_Flexure_Mechanism_Design","292359975_Modeling_Large_Spatial_Deflections_of_Slender_Bisymmetric_Beams_in_Compliant_Mechanisms_Using_Chained_Spatial-Beam-Constraint-Model_CSBCM","278381082_Modeling_Large_Planar_Deflections_of_Flexible_Beams_in_Compliant_Mechanisms_Using_Chained_Beam-Constraint-Model","275377266_Modeling_and_Experiments_of_Buckling_Modes_and_Deflection_of_Fixed-Guided_Beams_in_Compliant_Mechanisms","270590152_Extended_nonlinear_analytical_models_of_compliant_parallelogram_mechanisms_Third-order_models","270277568_Nonlinear_Analytical_Modeling_and_Characteristic_Analysis_of_a_Class_of_Compound_Multi-beam_Parallelogram_Mechanisms","324629617_A_Geometric_Interpretation_of_the_Solution_of_the_General_Quartic_Polynomial","308025945_Post-buckling_and_snap-through_behaviour_of_inclined_slender_beams","286941081_Curve_Decomposition_for_Large_Deflection_Analysis_of_Fixed-Guided_Beams_With_Application_to_Statically_Balanced_Compliant_Mechanisms","284502006_On_the_Use_of_the_Nodal_Elastica_for_the_Analysis_of_Flexible_Link_Devices"]}
