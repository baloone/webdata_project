{"id":"267515536_A_note_on_the_values_of_independence_polynomials_at_-1","abstract":"The independence polynomial $I(G;x)$ of a graph $G$ is\n$I(G;x)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\alpha(G)} s_k x^k$, where $s_k$ is the number of\nindependent sets in $G$ of size $k$. The decycling number of a graph $G$,\ndenoted $\\phi(G)$, is the minimum size of a set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ such that\n$G-S$ is acyclic. Engstr\\\"om proved that the independence polynomial satisfies\n$|I(G;-1)| \\leq 2^{\\phi(G)}$ for any graph $G$, and this bound is best\npossible. Levit and Mandrescu provided an elementary proof of the bound, and in\naddition conjectured that for every positive integer $k$ and integer $q$ with\n$|q|\\leq 2^k$, there is a connected graph $G$ with $\\phi(G)=k$ and $I(G;-1)=q$.\nIn this note, we prove this conjecture.","authors":["Jonathan Cutler","Nathan Kahl"],"meta":["October 2014Discrete Mathematics 339(11)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2016.05.019","SourcearXiv"],"references":["250703313_The_independence_polynomial_of_a_graph-A_survey","222537346_Upper_bounds_on_the_Witten_index_for_supersymmetric_lattice_models_by_discrete_Morse_theory","24148336_Supersymmetry_lattice_fermions_independence_complexes_and_cohomologytheory","267188584_Generalizations_of_the_matching_polynomial","257406926_The_Cyclomatic_Number_of_a_Graph_and_its_Independence_Polynomial_at_-1","220342971_Hard_Squares_with_Negative_Activity_on_Cylinders_with_Odd_Circumference","51939791_Special_cycles_in_independence_complexes_and_superfrustration_in_somelattices","45852664_A_Simple_Proof_of_an_Inequality_Connecting_the_Alternating_Number_ofIndependent_Sets_and_the_Decycling_Number","2135280_On_the_independence_complex_of_square_grids"]}
