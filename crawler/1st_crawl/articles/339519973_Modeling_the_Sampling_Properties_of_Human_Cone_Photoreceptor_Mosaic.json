{"id":"339519973_Modeling_the_Sampling_Properties_of_Human_Cone_Photoreceptor_Mosaic","abstract":"A computer model that possesses the sampling properties of human cone mosaic is potentially useful in helping us understand the impact of damage to photoreceptors on spatial vision. To this end, we examined the sampling properties of several published human foveal photoreceptor mosaics. These properties were then used as constraints in constructing a spatial sampling model which mimics basic features of real foveal cone mosaics such as rotated local clusters and desert island Fourier spectra.","authors":["Yi-Zhong Wang","Larry N.
