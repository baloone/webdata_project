{"id":"325831377_You_can_do_that_Feasibility_of_virtual_reality_exposure_therapy_in_the_treatment_of_PTSD_due_to_military_sexual_trauma","abstract":"This initial feasibility study examined the use of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) in the treatment of MST-related PTSD, with newly developed content tailored to MST. Participants included 15 veterans (26% male) with MST-related PTSD. Assessment of PTSD, depression, and psychophysiological indicators of distress occurred at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Treatment included 6â€“12 VRE sessions. There were significant reductions in pre- to post-treatment PTSD (CAPS severity: t(10) = 3.69, p =.004; PCL-5: t(10) = 3.79, p =.004) and depressive symptoms, (PHQ-9: t(8) = 2.83, p =.022), which were maintained at follow-up. There also was a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in heart rate response to a trauma cue. Cohen's d effect sizes were large (CAPS: d = 1.11; PCL-5: d = 1.14, PHQ-9: d =.94), and the percentage of participants meeting PTSD criteria continued to decline from post-treatment (53%) to follow-up (33%). Findings indicate VRE can be safely delivered and is a promising treatment for MST-related PTSD.","authors":["Laura Loucks","Carly Yasinski","Seth Norrholm","Jessica L Maples-Keller"],"meta":["June
