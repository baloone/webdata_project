{"id":"273393805_Secure_Control_Systems_A_Quantitative_Risk_Management_Approach","abstract":"Critical infrastructures must continuously operate safely and reliably, despite a variety of potential system disturbances. Given their strict operating requirements, such systems are automated and controlled in real time by several digital controllers receiving measurements from sensors and transmitting control signals to actuators. Since these physical systems are often spatially distributed, there is a need for information technology (IT) infrastructures enabling the timely data flow between the system components. These networked control systems are ubiquitous in modern societies [1]. Examples include the electric power network, intelligent transport systems, and industrial processes.","authors":["Andr√© Teixeira","Kin Cheong Sou","Henrik Sandberg","Karl H.
