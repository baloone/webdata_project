{"id":"298213144_Collaborative_e-learning_systems_using_semantic_data_interoperability","abstract":"In a collaborative e-learning content management environment, the heterogeneity of data in different learning management systems presents many difficulties for data sharing; some of these difficulties are how to integrate data, produce results for user queries, and find the correct data from heterogeneous learning management systems. Over the last few years, numerous e-learning system architectures have been proposed; however, issues related to sharing and integrating data from different e-learning systems have been given less attention. Considering this need, this paper presents solutions for semantic data interoperability, distributed metadata management, and an agent-based query processing approach for supporting the exchange of learning content from different e-learning systems. The paper presents an empirical evaluation of the user acceptability of the proposed solutions to find qualitative measures of the users' acceptability and satisfaction; our proposed solutions resulted in high user satisfaction.","authors":["Mehedi Masud"],"meta":["August 2016Computers in Human Behavior 61:127-135","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.094"],"references":["240759295_A_distributed_content-based_search_engine_based_on_mobile_code_and_Web_Service_Technology","225282384_Data_Interoperability_and_Multimedia_Content_Management_in_e-Health_Systems","220920436_c2004_Springer-Verlag_AutoMed_A_BAV_Data_Integration_System_for_Heterogeneous_Data_Sources","220416496_The_Clio_Project_Managing_Heterogeneity","291512285_Car_exterior_noise_prediction_based_on_statistical_energy_analysis_and_semi-infinite_fluid_method","284045371_The_TSIMMIS_project_Integration_of_heterogeneous_information_sources","224215894_Workload_Evaluation_and_Analysis_on_Virtual_Systems","220451580_Multimedia_Databases_and_Data_Management_A_Survey"]}
