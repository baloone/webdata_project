{"id":"305323190_Design_of_Synchronous_cyclic_code_counter_used_by_novel_Reversible_Gate","abstract":"This paper presents a new reversible gate for designing an Synchronous cyclic code counter.Reversible logic has considered now a days in quantum computing,modern nano technology& optical computing due to its higher performance,low power dissipation. This paper presents various classical operations of the proposed reversible gate. The proposed reversible gate is better for designing reversible counter compared to those gates required in the other literature. These Synchronous counter gives the initial threshold for more complex structures. Since the output of the sequential circuit depends not only on the present inputs but also on the past outputs,so the construction of the sequential circuit is more complex than that of combinational circuit. This paper has been developed as part of low power processor design in the platform Xilinx ISE 9.2 and\nsynthesized on 90nm Spartan-3E FPGA.","authors":["Researcher Ijartet","P.Lavanya","K.R.Poornima","R.Venkatesh"],"meta":["March 2016"],"references":["272718719_High_Efficient_Complex_Parallelism_for_Cryptography","228357393_A_beginning_in_the_reversible_logic_synthesis_of_sequential_circuits","224647507_A_new_look_at_reversible_memory_elements","221154925_Synthesis_of_Reversible_Sequential_Elements","220365615_Synthesis_of_Reversible_Sequential_Elements","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","263269643_Cramming_More_Components_Onto_Integrated_Circuits","226418586_Conservative_Logic","224714400_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Elements_With_Feasibility_of_Transistor_Implementation","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","215515923_Design_of_Counters_Using_Reversible_Logic","13391625_Reversible_logic_and_quantum_computers_Phys_Rev_A_32_3266-3276"]}
