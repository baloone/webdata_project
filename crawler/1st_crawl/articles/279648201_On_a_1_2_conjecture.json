{"id":"279648201_On_a_1_2_conjecture","abstract":"Let us assign positive integers to the edges and vertices of a simple graph G. As a result we obtain a vertex-colouring of G with integers, where a vertex colour is simply a sum of the weight assigned to the vertex itself and the weights of its incident edges. Can we obtain a proper colouring using only weights 1 and 2 for an arbitrary G? We give a positive answer when G is a 3-colourable, complete or 4-regular graph. We also show that it is enough to use weights from 1 to 11, as well as from 1 to ⌊ X(G)/2 ⌋ + 1, for an arbitrary graph G. 1365-8050 © 2010 Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DMTCS), Nancy, France.","authors":["J.
