{"id":"308010702_New_Approaches_to_E-Cognitive_Assessment_of_E-Learning","abstract":"A technology transfer project to innovate ecognitive assessment is described. Specifically, natural semantic networks (as opposed to idiosyncratic or artificial semantic nets) from 880 high school and bachelor students and teachers from different knowledge domains were used to computer simulate schemata behavior regarding each domain. Schemata-related words were implemented in a semantic priming study that students had to take before and after a course. Then a neural net was implemented capable of discriminating between successful and unsuccessful students by analyzing","authors":["Morales-Martinez Guadalupe Elizabeth","Ernesto Octavio López Ramírez","Lopez-Gonzalez Ana Elizabeth"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.20533/ijels.2046.4568.2015.0057"],"references":["262676235_New_Empirical_Directions_to_Evaluate_Online_Learning","262675871_Evaluating_Moral_Schemata_Learning","234671814_Question_Do_Standardized_Tests_Measure_General_Cognitive_Skills_Answer_No","232492410_Structural_Representations_in_Knowledge_Acquisition","232425555_On_the_Very_Long-Term_Retention_of_Knowledge_Acquired_Through_Formal_Education_Twelve_Years_of_Cognitive_Psychology","225741287_Semantic_Analyzer_of_Schemata_Organization_SASO","200026076_HCI_Models_Theories_and_Frameworks_Toward_a_Multidisciplinary_Science","346493719_Augmented_Learning_Research_and_Design_of_Mobile_Educational_Games","285964636_Distributed_learning_spaces_Physical_blended_and_virtual_learning_spaces_in_higher_education","285473387_Integrating_Instructional_Programs_through_Dimensions_of_Learning","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","278657781_Metrics_and_Models_for_Social_Networks","270584995_Knowing_What_Students_Know_The_Science_and_Design_of_Educational_Assessment","246856333_Very_long-term_memory_of_knowledge_acquired_at_school_and_university","234815928_Schemata_and_Sequential_Thought_Processes_in_PDP_Models","234642639_Lessons_from_the_Field_about_Outcome-Based_Performance_Assessments","232476339_Handbook_of_virtual_environments_Design_implementation_and_applications_Human_factors_and_ergonomics","229484982_The_Lack_of_Fidelity_Between_Cognitively_Complex_Constructs_and_Conventional_Test_Development_Practice","225255704_An_approach_to_the_problem_of_meaning_Semantic_networks","224638884_Augmented_Learning_Context-Aware_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Architecture_for_Learning","220651927_Model_of_Natural_Semantic_Space_for_Ontologies'_Construction","18719061_The_possible_influence_of_imagery_upon_retrieval_and_representation_in_LTM"]}
