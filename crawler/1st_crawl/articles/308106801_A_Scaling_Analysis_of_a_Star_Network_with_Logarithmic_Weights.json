{"id":"308106801_A_Scaling_Analysis_of_a_Star_Network_with_Logarithmic_Weights","abstract":"The paper investigates the properties of a class of resource allocation algorithms for communication networks: if a node of this network has $x$ requests to transmit, then it receives a fraction of the capacity proportional to $\\log(1{+}L)$, the logarithm of its current load $L$. A stochastic model of such an algorithm is investigated in the case of the star network, in which $J$ nodes can transmit simultaneously, but interfere with a central node $0$ in such a way that node $0$ cannot transmit while one of the other nodes does. One studies the impact of the log policy on these $J+1$ interacting communication nodes. A fluid scaling analysis of the network is derived with the scaling parameter $N$ being the norm of the initial state. It is shown that the asymptotic fluid behaviour of the system is a consequence of the evolution of the state of the network on a specific time scale $(N^t,\\, t{\\in}(0,1))$. The main result is that, on this time scale and under appropriate conditions, the state of a node with index $j\\geq 1$ is of the order of $N^{a_j(t)}$, with $0{\\leq}a_j(t){<}1$, where $t\\mapsto a_j(t)$ is a piecewise linear function. Convergence results on the fluid time scale and a stability property are derived as a consequence of this study.","authors":["Philippe Robert","Amandine VÃ©ber"],"meta":["September 2016Stochastic Processes and their Applications 129(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.spa.2018.06.002"],"references":["282462512_A_stochastic_analysis_of_resource_sharing_with_logarithmic_weights","268313581_Stochastic_networks_and_queues_Translation_from_the_French","261392737_Backlog-Based_Random_Access_in_Wireless_Networks_Fluid_Limits_and_Instability_Issues","257641991_Log-weight_scheduling_in_switched_networks","252050613_Backlog-based_random_access_in_wireless_networks_Fluid_limits_and_delay_issues","239559848_Inequalities_in_the_Theory_of_Queues","223629902_A_limit_theorem_for_perturbed_operator_semigroups_with_applications_to_random_evolutions"]}
