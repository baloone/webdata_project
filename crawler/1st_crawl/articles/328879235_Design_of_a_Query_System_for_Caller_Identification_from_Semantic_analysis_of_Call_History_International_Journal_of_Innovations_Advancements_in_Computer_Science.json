For example, there can be a Dev related to plumbing and another related to computer repairs. Assuming both are saved with the same name and different surnames, it becomes difficult to remember after a long break as to which one of these two is the plumber and which is the computer guy. It is in this context that speech-to-text conversion comes in handy. This, alongwith an inbuilt semantic knowledgebase (KB) to store keywords pertaining to previous conversations as the base can be used to create a semantic network that would then be used to recognize and differentiate our contacts. Such a KB would need a robust query system to retrieve the user-requests from the KB. This paper discusses the design of such a system and the issues thereof.","authors":["P.
