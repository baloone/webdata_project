{"id":"220420930_The_Profession_of_IT_Beyond_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"Some of the significant factors associated with computational thinking are presented. Computational thinking indicates a mental orientation to formulate problems as conversions of some input to an output and looking for algorithms to perform the conversions. The term also includes thinking with many levels of abstraction, use of mathematics to develop algorithms, and examining a solution. Several scientists think that the information processes can occur naturally and that computation is required to understand and control them. Computational thinking needs to be considered as a practice instead of a principle, that further means a method of doing thing at which various level of skills can be developed. The US National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) invites researchers to discuss how their projects advance computational thinking.","authors":["Peter Denning"],"meta":["June 2009Communications of the ACM 52(6):28-30","DOI:10.1145/1516046.1516054","SourceDBLP"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","220423890_Five_deep_questions_in_computing","222788325_Grand_challenges_to_computational_science","220427532_Computing_is_a_natural_science","220425905_Is_computer_science_science"]}
