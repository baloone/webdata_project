{"id":"290962656_Structure_Based_Data_De-Anonymization_of_Social_Networks_and_Mobility_Traces","abstract":"We present a novel de-anonymization attack on mobility trace data and social data. First, we design an Unified Similarity (US) measurement, based on which we present a US based De-Anonymization (DA) framework which iteratively de-anonymizes data with an accuracy guarantee. Then, to de-anonymize data without the knowledge of the overlap size between the anonymized data and the auxiliary data, we generalize DA to an Adaptive De-Anonymization (ADA) framework. Finally, we examine DA/ADA on mobility traces and social data sets.","authors":["Shouling Ji","Weiqing Li","Mudhakar Srivatsa","Jing He"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-13257-0_14","Conference: International Conference on Information Security"],"references":["221164375_On_the_evolution_of_user_interaction_in_Facebook","51986580_ArnetMiner_Extraction_and_Mining_of_Academic_Social_Networks","51965551_Jointly_Predicting_Links_and_Inferring_Attributes_using_aSocial-Attribute_Network_SAN","262212418_Deanonymizing_mobility_traces_Using_social_networks_as_a_side-channel","261847088_EBM_-_An_entropy-based_model_to_infer_social_strength_from_spatiotemporal_data","248484602_Node_Centrality_in_Weighted_Networks_Generalizing_Degree_and_Shortest_Paths","221655457_PiOS_Detecting_Privacy_Leaks_in_iOS_Applications","221260598_xBook_Redesigning_Privacy_Control_in_Social_Networking_Platforms","4339941_Robust_De-anonymization_of_Large_Sparse_Datasets"]}
