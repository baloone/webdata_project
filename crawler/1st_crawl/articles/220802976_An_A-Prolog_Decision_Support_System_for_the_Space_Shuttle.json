{"id":"220802976_An_A-Prolog_Decision_Support_System_for_the_Space_Shuttle","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to test if a programming methodology based on the declarative language A-Prolog and the systems for computing answer sets of such programs, can be successfully applied to the development of medium size knowledge-intensive applications. We report on a successful design and development of such a system controlling some of the functions of the Space Shuttle. Keywords: answer set programming, logic programming, planning. 1 Introduction The research presented in this paper is rooted in recent developments in several areas of AI. Advances in the work on semantics of negation in logic programming [12, 13] and on formalization of common-sense reasoning [25, 23] led to the development of the declarative language A-Prolog, used in this paper to encode the domain knowledge, and to an A-Prolog based methodology for representing defaults. Insights on the nature of causality and its relationship with answer sets 1 of logic programs [14, 21, 26] determined the way we...","authors":["Monica Nogueira","Marcello Balduccini","Michael Gelfond","Richard Watson"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45241-9_12","SourceDBLP","Conference: Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages, Third International Symposium, PADL 2001, Las Vegas, Nevada, March 11-12, 2001, Proceedings"],"references":["225156581_Lifschitz_V_Classical_Negation_in_Logic_Programs_and_Disjunctive_Databases_New_Generation_Computing_9_365-385","222507308_Representing_Actions_In_Logic_Programs_And_Default_Theories","221605597_Open_World_Planning_in_the_Situation_Calculus","336942383_Encoding_planning_problems_in_nonmonotonic_logic_programs","289829686_Representing_actions_in_logic_programs_and_default_theories_A_situation_calculus_approach","268978965_Classical_Negation_in_Logic_Programs_and_Deductive_Databases","248799759_The_Stable_Model_Se_-_mantics_for_Logic_Programs","245927958_Digital_Circuits_in_Prolog","222491781_Representing_Action_and_Change_by_Logic_Programs","222446031_Semantic_Considerations_on_Nonmonotonic_Logic"]}
