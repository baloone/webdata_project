{"id":"323325225_A_Cross-Case_Analysis_of_Instructional_Strategies_to_Support_Participation_of_K-8_Students_with_Disabilities_in_CS_for_All","abstract":"Despite the proliferation of K-12 computer science (CS) programs and implementation of \"CS for All\" initiatives in U.S. schools, little research has been conducted on effective pedagogical approaches in K-12 CS. Even less research has focused on meeting the needs of students with disabilities. This paper presents findings from a qualitative case study examining the experiences of teachers who taught CS classes that included students with disabilities. The goal of this study was to identify pedagogical approaches that the teachers used to meet the needs of all students. Results indicated that teachers implemented three primary instructional strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities including facilitating student collaboration, using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, and using explicit instruction to teach CS concepts.","authors":["Meg Ray","Maya Israel","Chung Eun Lee","Virginie Do"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1145/3159450.3159482","Conference: the 49th ACM Technical Symposium","Project: Project TACTIC: Teaching All Computational Thinking through Inclusion and Collaboration"],"references":["324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","318409075_AccessCSforall_making_computer_science_accessible_to_K-12_students_in_the_United_States","317953648_Naturalistic_inquiry","316566726_Exploratory_Research_to_Expand_Opportunities_in_Computer_Science_for_Students_with_Learning_Differences","316116948_Elementary_Students_and_Computer_Programming","301745270_Instructional_supports_for_students_with_disabilities_in_K-5_computing_Findings_from_a_cross-case_analysis","297631812_Enhancing_the_quality_and_credibility_of_qualitative_analysis","289066557_Thought_and_language","276268396_A_Practical_Reader_in_Universal_Design_for_Learning","273052884_Naturalistic_Inquiry","269724670_Supporting_all_learners_in_school-wide_computational_thinking_A_cross-case_qualitative_analysis","257665099_Why_they_leave_The_impact_of_stereotype_threat_on_the_attrition_of_women_and_minorities_from_science_math_and_engineering_majors","248287474_Thought_and_Language","243668245_The_Origins_of_Intelligence_in_Child","230853014_Explicit_instruction_Effective_and_efficient_teaching","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","221931866_Multiple_Case_Study_Analysis","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning","26734640_Weighted_Kappa_-_Nominal_Scale_Agreement_with_Provision_for_Scaled_Disagreement_Or_Partial_Credit","12710628_Enhancing_the_Quality_and_Credibilty_of_Qualitative_Analysis"]}
