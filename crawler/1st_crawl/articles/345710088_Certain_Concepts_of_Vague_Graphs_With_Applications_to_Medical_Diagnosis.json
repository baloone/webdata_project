{"id":"345710088_Certain_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs_With_Applications_to_Medical_Diagnosis","abstract":"The purpose of this research study is to present and explore the key properties of\nsome new operations on vague graphs, including rejection, maximal product, symmetric\ndifference, and residue product. This article introduces the notions of degree of a vertex\nand total degree of a vertex in a vague graph. As well, this study outlines the specific\nconditions required for obtaining the degrees of vertices in vague graphs under the\noperations of maximal product, symmetric difference, and rejection. The article also\ndiscusses applications of vague sets in medical diagnosis.","authors":["Zehui Shao","Saeed Kosari","Muhammad Shoaib","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["November 2020Frontiers in Physics 8","DOI:10.3389/fphy.2020.00357","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["285580973_New_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs","283070761_Product_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","264223627_141_On_Irregular_Fuzzy_Graphs","329626033_New_Concepts_in_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Labeling_Graphs","316826730_New_Concepts_of_coloring_in_Vague_Graphs_With_Application","309457075_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","291972962_New_concepts_of_vague_competition_graphs","291608143_Regularity_of_Vague_Graphs","268550632_Fuzzy_graphs","265201014_Vague_Graphs"]}
