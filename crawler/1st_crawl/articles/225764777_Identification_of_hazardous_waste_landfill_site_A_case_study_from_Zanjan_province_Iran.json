{"id":"225764777_Identification_of_hazardous_waste_landfill_site_A_case_study_from_Zanjan_province_Iran","abstract":"The study of landfill sites is one of the most important studies in landfill engineering, and the landfill site selection\ninvolves combination of engineering, science, and politics. This paper describes a comprehensive hazardous waste landfill\nsite selection methodology with the combined utilization of geographic information system and multiple criteria analysis methods,\nas applied to the Zanjan province in Iran. The six main data categories that were used are geological/engineering geological,\ngeomorphological, hydrological/hydrogeological, climatological, pedological, and social/economical criteria, which included\n31 input layers in total. A suitability map for hazardous waste landfilling was prepared for study area with five classes\nfrom most suitable to completely unsuitable. Finally, out of the three sites, one site was selected which was chosen by the\nlocal authorities. Our work offers a comprehensive methodology and provides essential support for decision-makers in the assessment\nof hazardous waste management problems in Zanjan province in I.R. Iran and other developing cities in other countries.\n\nKeywordsGeographic information system–Multiple criteria analysis–Landfill site selection–Simple additive weighting–Suitability index","authors":["M.
