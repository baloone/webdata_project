{"id":"280715660_Hybrid_GRASP_Heuristics_to_Solve_an_Unrelated_Parallel_Machine_Scheduling_Problem_with_Earliness_and_Tardiness_Penalties","abstract":"This paper considers an unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the total earliness and tardiness penalties. Machine and job-sequence dependent setup times and idle times are considered. Since the studied problem is NP-Hard, we test the applicability of algorithms based on Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic to determine near-optimal solutions. We propose three different heuristics. The first is a simple GRASP heuristic, the second heuristic includes an intensification procedure based on Path Relinking technique, and the third uses an Iterated Local Search (ILS) heuristic in the local search phase of the GRASP algorithm. The results obtained by the heuristics are compared using a set of small, medium and large instances. Comprehensive computational and statistical analyses are carried out in order to compare the performance of the algorithms.","authors":["João Paulo de C. M. Nogueira","José Elias C.
