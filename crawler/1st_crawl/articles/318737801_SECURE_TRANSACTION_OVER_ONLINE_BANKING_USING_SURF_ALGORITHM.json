{"id":"318737801_SECURE_TRANSACTION_OVER_ONLINE_BANKING_USING_SURF_ALGORITHM","abstract":"Image processing is a method to convert an image into digital form and perform some operation on it. Image processing forms core to research area within engineering and computer science disciplines too. The existing system, is not secured to a great extent. It is not too much efficient as compared to proposed system. To provide more security in this application we use Multimedia Retrieval Benchmark suite. In this user has to select a feature point in an image. If it is correct then only the user can access this application. The objective of this project is to provide high security. In this system, we provide two type of authentication. One is password authentication and another one is image authentication. It is highly secure. It is quiet convenient as you can easily pay your bill and transfer funds between accounts etc. The SURF algorithm system is used to detect the feature point in an image. The improved version of SIFT is SURF. \nIndex Terms: Multimedia Benchmark suite, SURF algorithm, Authentication","authors":["Researcher Ijar","P.Ishwariya","Manisha Baskar","J.Mary Rosary"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["324848396_AN_IMPROVED_IMAGE_MATCHING_METHOD_BASED_ON_SURF_ALGORITHM","294295900_Liver_And_Hepatic_Tumors_Segmentation_in_3-D_CT_Images","295961608_EEG-Based_Assessment_of_Image_Sequence-Based_User_Authentication_in_Computer_Network_Security","269296244_Image_registration_research_based_on_SUSAN-SURF_algorithm"]}
