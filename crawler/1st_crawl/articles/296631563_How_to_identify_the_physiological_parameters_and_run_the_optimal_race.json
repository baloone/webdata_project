{"id":"296631563_How_to_identify_the_physiological_parameters_and_run_the_optimal_race","abstract":"This paper shows how a system of ordinary differential equations\ndescribing the evolution of the anaerobic energy, the oxygen uptake, the propulsive force and the velocity of a runner accurately describes pacing strategy. We find a protocol to identify the physiological parameters needed in the\nmodel using numerical simulations and time splits measurements for an 80m and a 1600m race. The velocity curve of the simulations is very close to the experimental one. This model could allow\nto study the influence of training and improving some specific parameters for the pacing strategy.","authors":["Amandine Aftalion","Louis-Henri Despaigne","Alexis Frentz","Pierre Gabet"],"meta":["March 2016MathematicS In Action 7(1):1-10","DOI:10.5802/msia.9"],"references":["272164813_Optimization_of_Running_Strategies_Based_on_Anaerobic_Energy_and_Variations_of_Velocity","228081108_Pacing_in_Olympic_track_races_Competitive_tactics_versus_best_performance_strategy","24022871_The_physiological_regulation_of_pacing_strategy_during_exercise_A_critical_review","324457860_Optimal_Velocity_in_a_Race","265916232_Optimal_Velocity_in_a_Race","252104393_A_Theory_on_Competitive_Running","245124237_The_optimal_strategy_for_running_a_race_A_mathematical_model_for_world_records_from_50_m_to_275_km","220222532_Optimal_Strategies_for_a_Two-Runner_Model_of_Middle-Distance_Running","51103355_Effects_of_optimal_pacing_strategies_for_400-_800-_and_1500-m_races_on_the_VO2_response","23713640_An_Analysis_of_Pacing_Strategies_During_Men's_World-Record_Performances_in_Track_Athletics"]}
