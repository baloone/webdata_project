{"id":"268369195_Design_and_Implementation_of_Neural_Networks_Neurons_with_RadBas_LogSig_and_TanSig_Activation_Functions_on_FPGA","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are utilized in several key areas such as prediction, classification, motor control, etc. When high performance is needed, FPGA realizations of the ANNs are preferred. In this study, we designed and implemented a total of 18 different FPGA-based neurons, 2, 4 and 6-input biased and non-biased with each having three different activation functions requiring the calculations of e x. Our purpose was to show the possibility of implementing neural networks with exponential activation functions on current FPGAs and measure the performance of the neurons. The results showed that up to 10 neurons can fit in to the smallest Virtex-6 and the network can be clocked up to 405MHz.
