{"id":"265427016_Expander_graphs_and_their_application","abstract":"A major consideration we had in writing this survey was to make it accessible to mathematicians as well as to computer scientists, since expander graphs, the protagonists of our story, come up in numerous and often surprising contexts in both fields. But, perhaps, we should start with a few words about graphs in general. They are, of course, one of the prime objects of study in Discrete Mathematics. However, graphs are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. In the natural and social sciences they model relations among species, societies, companies, etc. In computer science, they represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices as well as the flow of computation, and more. In mathematics, Cayley graphs are useful in Group Theory. Graphs carry a natural metric and are therefore useful in Geometry, and though they are “just ” one-dimensional complexes, they are useful in certain parts of Topology, e.g. Knot Theory. In statistical physics, graphs can represent local connections between interacting parts of a system, as well as the dynamics of a physical process on such","authors":["Shlomo Hoory","Nathan Linial","Avi Widgerson"],"meta":["October 2006Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 43(4)","DOI:10.1090/S0273-0979-06-01126-8"],"references":["301840852_Extensions_of_Lipschitz_mappings_into_a_Hilbert_space","324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","316518693_Groups_and_expanders","314819130_A_proof_of_alon's_second_eigenvalue_conjecture","313185557_On_the_complexity_of_approximating_the_independent_set_problem","312968905_A_polynomial-time_approximation_algorithm_for_the_permanent_of_a_matrix_with_nonnegative_entries","298925961_BOUNDED_GENERATION_AND_KAZHDAN'S_PROPERTY_T","291049932_Hardness_of_Approximations_in_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","288383753_Lower_bounds_for_matrix_product_in_bounded_depth_circuits_with_arbitrary_gates","284817601_On_the_Baum-Connes_assembly_map_for_discrete_groups","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","283996417_Mixing_times","274214612_Geometric_Inequalities","271512876_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_Vol_II","270308489_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","268496537_Random_Graphs","268019394_Minors_in_lifts_of_graphs","266436172_Combinatorics_Set_systems_hypergraphs_families_of_vectors_and_combinatorial_probability","265549313_What_is_An_expander","265365538_Explicit_Construction_of_Linear_Sized_Tolerant_Networks","260416644_Error_Detecting_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","257144033_Sorting_inc_logn_parallel_steps","254892330_Geometric_Methods_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","254206489_Filling_Riemannian_Manifolds","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","249643122_Superconcentrators_generalizers_and_generalized_connectors_with_limited_depth","248580743_The_complexity_of_an_optimal_non_-_blocking_com_-_mutation_scheme_without_reorganization","248570779_On_the_Spectrum_of_Graphs_and_Their_Universal_Covering","248569141_On_graphs_of_high_girth","248556896_Fonctions_harmonique_sur_un_arbe","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","245942755_Discrete_Groups_Expanding_Graphs_and_Invariant_Measures","244958444_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication_The_Bell_System_Technical_Journal","244957437_A_Historical_Review_of_the_Isoperimetric_Theorem_in_2-D_and_its_place_in_Elementary_Plane_Geometry","244475199_Connection_of_the_dual_space_of_a_group_with_the_structure_of_its_close_subgroups","244440202_Recent_developments_in_extractors","243788225_Kazhdan_Constants_for_SlnZ","243572781_A_time_randomness_tradeoff","242596017_Explicit_Concentrators_from_Generalized_N-Gons","242584784_Explicit_group-theoretical_constructions_of_combinatorial_schemes_and_their_application_to_the_design_of_expanders_and_concentrators","242583571_Linear_Representations_of_Finite_Groups","242583566_Explicit_concentrators_from_generalized_n-gons","242576586_Asymptotic_theory_of_finite_dimensional_spaces","242538624_On_the_Complexity_of_a_Concentrator","242490225_Approximating_clique_is_almost_NP-complete","242478759_Models_of_Random_Regular_Graphs","242410181_Explicit_constructions_of_expanders","242409962_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Roots_of_Certain_Symmetric_Matrices","242396851_A_lower_bound_for_the_smallest_eigenvalue_of_the_Laplacian","238225625_Elementary_Number_Theory_Group_Theory_and_Ramanujan_Graphs","240440378_On_a_connection_between_the_dual_space_of_a_group_and_the_structure_of_its_closed_subgroups","239979481_On_the_Impossibility_of_Dimension_Reduction_in_l1","239067087_l1_Isoperimetric_inequalities_for_graphs_and_superconcentrators","238225952_Etudes_des_coefficients_Fourier_des_fonctiones_de_LpG"]}
