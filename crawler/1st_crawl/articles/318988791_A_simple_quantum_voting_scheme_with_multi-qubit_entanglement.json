{"id":"318988791_A_simple_quantum_voting_scheme_with_multi-qubit_entanglement","abstract":"We propose a simple quantum voting scenario with a set of pairs of particles in a multi-particle entangled state. This scenario is suitable for large scale general votings. We also provide a proof of security of our scheme against the most general type of attack by generalizing Shor and Preskillâ€™s proof of security of the other schemes.","authors":["Peng Xue","Xin Zhang"],"meta":["December 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-07976-1"],"references":["303553201_Quantum_anonymous_voting_with_unweighted_continuous-variable_graph_states","303521353_Self-tallying_quantum_anonymous_voting","284249457_A_Voting_Protocol_Based_on_the_Controlled_Quantum_Operation_Teleportation","270454482_Quantum_voting_and_violation_of_Arrow's_Impossibility_Theorem","235505477_Quantum_anonymous_voting_for_continuous_variables","312066446_Protocols_for_quantum_binary_voting","292484116_Conditional_efficient_multiuser_quantum_cryptography_network","257472063_Anonymous_quantum_network_voting_scheme","239375205_Advances_In_Cryptology-Crypto","235458001_Conditional_efficient_multiuser_quantum_cryptography_network"]}
