{"id":"347950910_BlockNet_White_Paper_-_Interdisciplinary_Blockchain_Education_-_Curriculum_Guidance_Document","abstract":"Blockchain is a challenging topic since it is novel and fosters potential innovation. The blockchain is attractive for various disciplines, and, because of its cross-cutting nature, needs knowledge stemming from various disciplines. The devised curriculum can be instantiated specifically to meet the needs of students’ groups from various disciplines. The pedagogical innovation of the project is the inclusion of interdisciplinary project groups with participant’s interaction via online platforms for project-based learning activities. MOOCs and SNOCs allow blended-learning for interdisciplinary and geographically distributed student groups.","authors":["Boris Düdder","Vladislav V.
