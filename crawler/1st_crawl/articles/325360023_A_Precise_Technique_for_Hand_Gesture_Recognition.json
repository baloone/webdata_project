{"id":"325360023_A_Precise_Technique_for_Hand_Gesture_Recognition","abstract":"Vision based methodologies provides a more natural and proficient result when contrasted with traditional strategies which have been utilized for hand gesture recognition. In this paper, we proposed a video based hand gesture recognition. Our approach commences by acquiring the video frame from a source and converting it into 2D binary frame using YCbCr color space. We implemented opening and closing operations to filter the noise from the frame. In order to track and segment the hand gesture we used Kalman filter and convex hull along with convexity defects for detecting hand regions from the frame. Our framework can perceive six kinds of hand gestures at present time.","authors":["Ayush Purohit","Shardul Singh Chauhan"],"meta":["January 2018","Project: A Precise Technique for Human Action Recognition"],"references":["286791813_Human_hand_gesture_recognition_using_a_convolution_neural_network","259483004_Implementation_of_Hand_Detection_based_Techniques_for_Human_Computer_Interaction","236160250_Hand_gesture_recognition_with_depth_images_A_review","224120227_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_using_Neural_Networks","321514208_Kalman_Filtering","261525464_Hand_gesture_recognition_using_different_algorithms_based_on_artificial_neural_network","261166240_A_real-time_hand_gesture_recognition_method","232618880_An_Automatic_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_System_Based_on_Viola-Jones_Method_and_SVMs","224718743_A_Real-Time_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Method","224255511_Hand_gesture_recognition_by_stereo_camera_using_the_thinning_method","4232787_Hand_Posture_Classification_and_Recognition_using_the_Modified_Census_Transform","223503456_Video_object_tracking_using_adaptive_Kalman_filter"]}
