{"id":"300318324_Mixed_Hypergraphs_for_Linear-Time_Construction_of_Denser_Hashing-Based_Data_Structures","abstract":"There are several hashing-based data structures whose space utilization (keys per table cells) directly depends on the edge density threshold for the appearance of a 2-core in some underlying random k-uniform hypergraph. We show that by modifying these data structures such that the k-uniform hypergraphs are replaced by certain non-uniform hypergraphs their space utilization can be improved. These non-uniform hypergraphs are a mixture of uniform hypergraphs each with a linear number of edges but with different edge sizes. In the case of two different edge sizes we give a solution for the optimal (expected) number of edges of each size such that the 2-core threshold for the resulting mixed hypergraph is maximized. For suitable edge sizes we obtain optimal thresholds for mixed hypergraphs up to 0.920, improving the maximum 2-core threshold for any random k-uniform hypergraph, which is about 0.818.","authors":["Michael Rink"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35843-2_31","Conference: International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science"],"references":["262974149_Raptor_Codes","261170589_Invertible_Bloom_Lookup_Tables","228909031_Online_codes","221591840_Practical_Loss-Resilient_Codes","221219992_Simple_and_Space-Efficient_Minimal_Perfect_Hash_Functions","220753160_Graphs_Hypergraphs_and_Hashing","3080331_Efficient_erasure_correcting_codes_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory","2643211_Practical_Loss-Resilient_Codes","274171738_A_Family_of_Perfect_Hashing_Methods","262293485_Tight_thresholds_for_cuckoo_hashing_via_XORSAT","228863063_Tight_Thresholds_for_Cuckoo_Hashing_via_XORSAT_Extended_Abstract","223130063_On_Thresholds_for_the_Appearance_of_2-cores_in_Mixed_Hypergraphs","220898885_Orientability_of_Random_Hypergraphs_and_the_Power_of_Multiple_Choices","220897987_Succinct_Data_Structures_for_Retrieval_and_Approximate_Membership_Extended_Abstract","220779252_The_pure_literal_rule_threshold_and_cores_in_random_hypergraphs","220779004_The_Bloomier_Filter_An_Efficient_Data_Structure_for_Static_Support_Lookup_Tables","220770467_Experimental_Variations_of_a_Theoretically_Good_Retrieval_Data_Structure","220770303_Hash_Displace_and_Compress","220345359_The_Cores_of_Random_Hypergraphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","1733092_Poisson_Cloning_Model_for_Random_Graphs"]}
