{"id":"341606653_Outperforming_Neural_Readers_Using_Broad-Context_Discriminative_Language_Modeling_on_the_LAMBADA_Word_Prediction_Task","abstract":"Since Hinton and Salakhutdinov published their landmark science paper in 2006 ending the previous neural-network winter, research in neural networks has increased dramatically. Researchers have applied neural networks seemingly successfully to various topics in the field of computer science. However, there is a risk that we overlook other methods. Therefore, we take a recent end-to-end neural-network-based work (Dhingra et al., 2018) as a starting point and contrast this work with more classical techniques. This prior work fo-cuses on the LAMBADA word prediction task, where broad context is used to predict the last word of a sentence. It is often assumed that neural networks are good at such tasks where feature extraction is important. We show that with simpler syntactic and semantic features (e.g. Across Sentence Boundary (ASB) N-grams) a state-of-the-art neural network can be outperformed. Our discriminative language-model-based approach improves the word prediction accuracy from 55.6% to 58.9% on the LAM-BADA task. As a next step, we plan to extend this work to other language model-ing tasks.","authors":["Nima Nabizadeh","Mittul Singh","Dietrich Klakow"],"meta":["May 2018"],"references":["319235738_Long-Short_Range_Context_Neural_Networks_for_Language_Modeling","319185251_Sparse_Non-Negative_Matrix_Language_Modeling_Maximum_Entropy_Flexibility_on_the_Cheap","309461050_Broad_Context_Language_Modeling_as_Reading_Comprehension","306093716_The_LAMBADA_dataset_Word_prediction_requiring_a_broad_discourse_context","354184190_One_billion_word_benchmark_for_measuring_progress_in_statistical_language_modeling","325447341_Neural_Models_for_Reasoning_over_Multiple_Mentions_Using_Coreference","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","301847993_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Language_Modeling","300412390_Sparse_non-negative_matrix_language_modeling_for_geo-annotated_query_session_data","285244895_A_Decade_of_Discriminative_Language_Modeling_for_Automatic_Speech_Recognition","221489926_Recurrent_neural_network_based_language_model","280590083_Document_Embedding_with_Paragraph_Vectors","279535160_Sparse_Non-negative_Matrix_Language_Modeling_For_Skip-grams","257216876_A_metric_to_search_for_relevant_words","221787081_Ranking_and_Extraction_of_Relevant_Single_Words_in_Text"]}
