{"id":"336545778_Design_of_a_SWOT_Analysis_Model_and_its_Evaluation_in_Diverse_Digital_Business_Ecosystem_Contexts","abstract":"Investigating the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) of enterprise systems is popular among business researchers in major organizations. Many establishments carry out SWOT analysis at strategic planning, quality control while formulating government policies and legislations. In the digital ecosystems scenarios, the SWOT activities need a great deal of attention, in particular, while designing and promoting new strategies of multiple industry scenarios in the Integrated Project Management context, keeping in view complex business operations. Information solutions may not have choices, failing to address priorities and provide alternate solutions. We focus on digital ecosystem methodologies, in which the business and organizational issues, challenges and priorities are addressed. The purpose of the research is designing a new SWOT model in which the elements are modelled to interrogate managersâ€™ views to oversee new insights of a variety of business contexts that can guide SWOT analyzers and provide digital ecosystem services in multiple industry operations in an optimum manner. Issues and challenges of elements of SWOT of several public and private sector companies are analyzed, documented and modelled to evaluate unified metadata representing multiple industry views, their visualization and interpretation in new knowledge domains.","authors":["Christine Namugenyi","Shastri Lakshman Nimmagadda","Torsten Reiners"],"meta":["October 2019Procedia Computer Science 159:1145-1154","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.283","Project: Big Data Business Research"],"references":["322550496_The_Use_of_Some_Forecasting_Methods_and_SWOT_Analysis_in_the_Selected_Processes_of_Foundry","319367788_SWOT_ANALYSIS_A_THEORETICAL_REVIEW","303363742_A_SWOT_analysis_of_big_data","281524164_On_new_emerging_concepts_of_Petroleum_Digital_Ecosystem_PDE","272353031_SWOT_Analysis","268011484_Strengths_weaknesses_opportunities_and_threats_SWOT_analysis_for_farming_system_businesses_management_Case_of_wheat_farmers_of_Shadervan_District_Shoushtar_Township_Iran","260283812_Information_Technology_in_Managing_the_Supply_Chain","224453768_Petro-data_cluster_mining_-_knowledge_building_analysis_of_complex_petroleum_systems","325116143_On_big_data-guided_upstream_business_research_and_its_knowledge_management","301281026_Importance-Performance_Analysis_based_SWOT_analysis"]}
