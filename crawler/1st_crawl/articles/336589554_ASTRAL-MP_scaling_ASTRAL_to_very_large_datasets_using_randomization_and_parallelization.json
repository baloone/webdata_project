{"id":"336589554_ASTRAL-MP_scaling_ASTRAL_to_very_large_datasets_using_randomization_and_parallelization","abstract":"Motivation: \nEvolutionary histories can change from one part of the genome to another. The potential for discordance between the gene trees has motivated the development of summary methods that reconstruct a species tree from an input collection of gene trees. ASTRAL is a widely used summary method and has been able to scale to relatively large datasets. However, the size of genomic datasets is quickly growing. Despite its relative efficiency, the current single-threaded implementation of ASTRAL is falling behind the data growth trends is not able to analyze the largest available datasets in a reasonable time.\n\nResults: \nASTRAL uses dynamic programing and is not trivially parallel. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-MP, the first version of ASTRAL that can exploit parallelism and also uses randomization techniques to speed up some of its steps. Importantly, ASTRAL-MP can take advantage of not just multiple CPU cores but also one or several graphics processing units (GPUs). The ASTRAL-MP code scales very well with increasing CPU cores, and its GPU version, implemented in OpenCL, can have up to 158Ã— speedups compared to ASTRAL-III. Using GPUs and multiple cores, ASTRAL-MP is able to analyze datasets with 10 000 species or datasets with more than 100 000 genes in <2 days.\n\nAvailability and implementation: \nASTRAL-MP is available at https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL/tree/MP.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["John Yin","Chao Zhang","Siavash Mirarab"],"meta":["October 2019Bioinformatics 35(20):3961-3969","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz211"],"references":["328532445_Multi-allele_species_reconstruction_using_ASTRAL","325017725_ASTRAL-III_Polynomial_time_species_tree_reconstruction_from_partially_resolved_gene_trees","320414031_Fragmentary_Gene_Sequences_Negatively_Impact_Gene_Tree_and_Species_Tree_Reconstruction","319006355_Nuclear_genomic_signals_of_the_'microturbellarian'_roots_of_platyhelminth_evolutionary_innovation","312310369_Genome-wide_interrogation_advances_resolution_of_recalcitrant_groups_in_the_tree_of_life","312043429_Accounting_for_Uncertainty_in_Gene_Tree_Estimation_Summary-Coalescent_Species_Tree_Inference_in_a_Challenging_Radiation_of_Australian_Lizards","309955881_Anchoring_quartet-based_phylogenetic_distances_and_applications_to_species_tree_reconstruction","308807733_On_the_Weighted_Quartet_Consensus_problem","303944704_Whole-genome_analyses_resolve_early_branches_in_the_tree_of_life_of_modern_birds","302584366_Phylotranscriptomic_analysis_of_the_origin_and_early_diversification_of_land_plants","301334501_Fast_Coalescent-Based_Computation_of_Local_Branch_Support_from_Quartet_Frequencies","292943400_New_deep-sea_species_of_Xenoturbella_and_the_position_of_Xenacoelomorpha","289524277_The_Interrelationships_of_Placental_Mammals_and_the_Limits_of_Phylogenetic_Inference","283005517_ASTRID_Accurate_species_TRees_from_internode_distances","278331707_ASTRAL-II_Coalescent-based_species_tree_estimation_with_many_hundreds_of_taxa_and_thousands_of_genes","272924717_Response_to_Comment_on_Statistical_binning_enables_an_accurate_coalescent-based_estimation_of_the_avian_tree","269408345_Whole-genome_analyses_resove_early_branches_in_the_tree_of_life_of_modern_birds","268386250_A_phylotranscriptomics_analysis_of_the_origin_and_diversification_of_land_plants","267916365_Phylogenomics_resolves_the_timing_and_pattern_of_insect_evolution","267756853_ASTRAL_Genome-scale_coalescent-based_species_tree_estimation","264610403_Quartet_Inference_from_SNP_Data_Under_the_Coalescent_Model","221965269_Inferring_Species_Trees_Directly_from_Biallelic_Genetic_Markers_Bypassing_Gene_Trees_in_a_Full_Coalescent_Analysis","50907071_Estimating_Species_Trees_from_Unrooted_Gene_Trees","47394925_A_maximum_pseudo-likelihood_approach_forestimating_species_trees_under_the_coalescent","44651578_Estimating_Species_Phylogenies_Using_Coalescence_Times_Among_Sequences","41425088_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting_Consistent_Phylogeny_Estimation_From_Multiple_Loci","38083310_Bayesian_Inference_of_Species_Trees_from_Multilocus_Data","31137863_Gene_Trees_in_Species_Trees","23263359_BEST_Bayesian_estimation_of_species_trees_under_the_coalescent_model","10603439_Bayes_Estimation_of_Species_Divergence_Times_and_Ancestral_Population_Sizes_Using_DNA_Sequences_From_Multiple_Loci","6666668_Widespread_Discordance_of_Gene_Trees_with_Species_Tree_in_Drosophila_Evidence_for_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting","6441501_Inconsistency_of_Phylogenetic_Estimates_from_Concatenated_Data_under_Coalescence","331311687_Statistical_binning_enables_an_accurate_coalescent-based_estimation_of_the_avian_tree","312564795_Anchored_phylogenomics_improves_the_resolution_of_evolutionary_relationships_in_the_rapid_radiation_of_Protea_L","311556592_A_maximum_pseudo-likelihood_approach_for_estimating_species_trees_under_the_coalescent_model","279178234_Land_connectivity_changes_and_global_cooling_shaped_the_colonization_history_and_diversification_of_New_World_quail_Aves_Galliformes_Odontophoridae","271587122_Gene_tree_discordance_phylogenetic_and_the_multispecies_coalescent","270292272_Likelihood-based_tree_reconstruction_on_a_concatenation_of_alignments_can_be_statistically_inconsistent","267755835_Evaluating_Summary_Methods_for_Multilocus_Species_Tree_Estimation_in_the_Presence_of_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting","261602731_Disentangling_Methodological_and_Biological_Sources_of_Gene_Tree_Discordance_on_Oryza_Poaceae_Chromosome_3","222554869_Constructing_Optimal_Trees_from_Quartets","221879204_Tree_topologies_under_incomplete_lineage_sorting_by_maximum_likelihood","220430241_Parallelized_phylogenetic_post-analysis_on_multi-core_architectures","46403062_BUCKy_Gene_Tree_Species_Tree_Reconciliation_with_Bayesian_Concordance_Analysis","24220376_Degnan_JH_Rosenberg_NA_Gene_tree_discordance_phylogenetic_inference_and_the_multispecies_coalescent_Trends_Ecol_Evol_24_332-340","19962174_Relationships_Between_Gene_Trees_and_Species_Trees"]}
