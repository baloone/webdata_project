{"id":"317487665_Replicated_Synchronization_for_Imperative_BSP_Programs","abstract":"The BSP model (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) simplifies the construction and evaluation of parallel algorithms, with its simplified synchronization structure and cost model. Nevertheless, imperative BSP programs can suffer from synchronization errors. Programs with textually aligned barriers are free from such errors, and this structure eases program comprehension. We propose a simplified formalization of barrier inference as data flow analysis, which verifies statically whether an imperative BSP program has replicated synchronization, which is a sufficient condition for textual barrier alignment.","authors":["Arvid Jakobsson","Frédéric Dabrowski","Wadoud Bousdira","Frederic Loulergue"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 108:535-544","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.123","Projects: SPMD Program AnalysisBSPlib program verification"],"references":["263052122_Frama-c_a_Software_Analysis_Perspective","261429129_A_clustered_manycore_processor_architecture_for_embedded_and_accelerated_applications","221496788_Concurrency_Analysis_for_Parallel_Programs_with_Textually_Aligned_Barriers","220687482_A_bulk-synchronous_parallel_process_algebra","220594628_Axiomatic_Frameworks_for_Developing_Bsp-style_Programs","325656375_Frama-C_A_software_analysis_perspective","227213152_Logic_of_Global_Synchrony","222506723_BSPlib_the_BSP_programming_library","221643665_Barrier_matching_for_programs_with_textually_unaligned_barriers","220997514_Barrier_Inference"]}
