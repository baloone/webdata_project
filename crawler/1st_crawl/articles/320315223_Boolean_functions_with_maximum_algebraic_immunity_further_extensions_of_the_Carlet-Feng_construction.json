{"id":"320315223_Boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity_further_extensions_of_the_Carlet-Feng_construction","abstract":"The algebraic immunity of Boolean functions is studied in this paper. More precisely, having the prominent Carlet–Feng construction as a starting point, we propose a new method to construct a large number of functions with maximum algebraic immunity. The new method is based on deriving new properties of minimal codewords of the punctured Reed–Muller code \\(\\mathrm{RM}^{\\star }(\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor ,n)\\) for any n, allowing—if n is odd—for efficiently generating large classes of new functions that cannot be obtained by other known constructions. It is shown that high nonlinearity, as well as good behavior against fast algebraic attacks, is also attainable.","authors":["Konstantinos Limniotis","Nicholas Kolokotronis"],"meta":["August 2018Designs Codes and Cryptography 86(8)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-017-0418-5"],"references":["262234576_Perfect_Algebraic_Immune_Functions","318376303_Construction_of_Highly_Nonlinear_1-Resilient_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Provably_High_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity","314632675_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity_Based_on_Properties_of_Punctured_Reed-Muller_Codes","286236438_Properties_of_a_Family_of_Cryptographic_Boolean_Functions","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","282990841_Cyclic_codes_and_algebraic_immunity_of_Boolean_functions","272030177_Two_constructions_of_balanced_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_high_nonlinearity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","271458226_Almost_perfect_algebraic_immune_functions_with_good_nonlinearity","257770234_Secondary_constructions_of_Boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","257555066_A_systematic_method_of_constructing_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_based_on_the_generator_matrix_of_the_Reed-Muller_code","246294979_General_Principles_of_Algebraic_Attacks_and_New_Design_Criteria_for_Components_of_Symmetric_Ciphers","235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","257554710_Construction_of_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_high_nonlinearity","252048597_Constructing_Boolean_functions_in_odd_number_of_variables_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes"]}
