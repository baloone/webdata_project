{"id":"308023433_The_orange_pi_Integrating_programming_through_electronic_technology","abstract":"Electronic technology plays an important role in developing technological literacy as evidenced by its significance\nthroughout Standard 16 of Standards for Technological Literacy (STL) (ITEA/ITEEA, 2000/2002/2007) and its\ndesignation as one of the nine core technologies (Smith & Gray, 2010). Electronics lessons provide an excellent opportunity for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts while addressing a number of the STL standards, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and Common Core State Standards\n(CCSS). Traditionally, electronics lessons have been taught via modules, electronic circuit stations, or circuit kits. Technological advances have allowed technology and engineering (T&E) educators to further engage students by teaching design-based STEM lessons in the context of the latest electronic technologies such as mobile phones, robotics, and drones.","authors":["Tyler S.
