{"id":"230700282_Performance_of_the_quantum_adiabatic_algorithm_on_random_instances_of_two_optimization_problems_on_regular_hypergraphs","abstract":"In this paper we study the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm on\nrandom instances of two combinatorial optimization problems, 3-regular 3-XORSAT\nand 3-regular Max-Cut. The cost functions associated with these two\nclause-based optimization problems are similar as they are both defined on\n3-regular hypergraphs. For 3-regular 3-XORSAT the clauses contain three\nvariables and for 3-regular Max-Cut the clauses contain two variables. The\nquantum adiabatic algorithms we study for these two problems use interpolating\nHamiltonians which are stoquastic and therefore amenable to sign-problem free\nquantum Monte Carlo and quantum cavity methods. Using these techniques we find\nthat the quantum adiabatic algorithm fails to solve either of these problems\nefficiently, although for different reasons.","authors":["Edward Farhi","David Gosset","Itay Hen","A.
