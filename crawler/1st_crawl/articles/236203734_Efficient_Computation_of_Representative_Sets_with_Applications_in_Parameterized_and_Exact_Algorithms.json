A subfamily Ŝ ⊆ S is q-representative for S if for every set Y ⊆ E of size at most q, if there is a set X ∈ S disjoint from Y with X U Y ∈ X, then there is a set X̂ ∈ Ŝ disjoint from Y with X U Y ∈ I. By the classical result of Bollobás, in a uniform matroid, every family of sets of size p has a q-representative family with at most (p+qp)sets. In his famous \"two families theorem\" from 1977, Lovász proved that the same bound also holds for any matroid representable over a field F. As observed by Marx, Lovász's proof is constructive. In this paper we show how Lovasz's proof can be turned into an algorithm constructing a q-representative family of size at most (p+qp) in time bounded by a polynomial in (p+qp), t, and the time required for field operations.
