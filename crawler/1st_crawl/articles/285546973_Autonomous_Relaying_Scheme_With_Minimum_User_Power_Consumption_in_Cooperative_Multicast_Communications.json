{"id":"285546973_Autonomous_Relaying_Scheme_With_Minimum_User_Power_Consumption_in_Cooperative_Multicast_Communications","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a probability-based relay selection and power control method in two-phase cooperative multicast communications to minimize the user power consumption for any given multicast data rate. Our method gives each user the ability to autonomously decide whether to participate in the relay transmission based on an active probability. In particular, we develop an optimal algorithm to calculate the optimal active probability and relay power by balancing the outage reduction efficiency. We also develop a sub-optimal algorithm by balancing the outage probability of the cell-center and the cell-edge users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimal and sub-optimal algorithms can reduce the user power consumption up to about 54% and 40%, respectively, compared with the conventional algorithm that requires all users to participate in the relay transmission.","authors":["Guodong Zhao","Wuyu Shi","Zhi Chen","Qi Zhang"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 15(4):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2015.2504523"],"references":["260711148_Two-Stage_Cooperative_Multicast_Transmission_with_Optimized_Power_Consumption_and_Guaranteed_Coverage","260670861_A_Survey_of_Wireless_Path_Loss_Prediction_and_Coverage_Mapping_Methods","254260190_Multicast_Scheduling_and_Resource_Allocation_Algorithms_for_OFDMA-Based_Systems_A_Survey","224699555_Outage_Capacity_of_Two-Phase_Space-Time_Coded_Cooperative_Multicasting","224394847_A_cooperative_multicast_scheduling_scheme_for_multimedia_services_in_IEEE_80216_networks","224242524_Multicast_Outage_Probability_and_Transmission_Capacity_of_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","224126774_A_Cooperative_Multicast_Strategy_in_Wireless_Networks","3433676_Energy-efficient_broadcasting_with_cooperative_transmissions_in_wireless_sensor_networks","3236506_On_the_power_efficiency_of_cooperative_broadcast_in_dense_wireless_networks","3236020_Cooperative_multicast_for_maximum_network_lifetime","3235925_Cooperative_Multihop_Broadcast_for_Wireless_Networks","3085893_Fundamental_limits_and_scaling_behavior_of_cooperative_multicasting_in_wireless_networks","317835542_Resource_Management_for_Device-to-Device_Underlay_Communication","261280785_QoE-aware_mobile_IPTV_multicast_system_over_WiMAX_network","260668280_Capacity_Maximization_and_Transmission_Rates_Optimization_for_Relay_Assisted_Wireless_Multicast","260667872_Exact_Outage_Probability_of_Relay_Selection_in_Decode-and-Forward_Based_Cooperative_Multicast_Systems","258846811_CooPNC_A_cooperative_multicast_protocol_exploiting_physical_layer_network_coding","254056914_Energy_Efficient_Cooperative_Multicast_Scheme_Based_on_Selective_Relay","240917681_Outage_Probability_and_Power_Allocation_for_Cooperative_Multicast_Systems","235988258_A_Survey_of_Multicasting_over_Wireless_Access_Networks","224145158_Energy_efficient_cooperative_multicasting_for_MBS_WiMAX_traffic","224142530_Cooperative_Wireless_Multicast_Performance_Analysis_and_PowerLocation_Optimization","3434196_Cooperative_Communications_with_Outage-Optimal_Opportunistic_Relaying","3236509_CoopMAC_a_cooperative_MAC_for_wireless_LANs","3085253_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks_Efficient_Protocols_and_Outage_Behavior"]}
