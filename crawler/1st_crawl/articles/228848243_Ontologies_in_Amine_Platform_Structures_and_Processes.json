{"id":"228848243_Ontologies_in_Amine_Platform_Structures_and_Processes","abstract":"The theoretical part of this paper presents and discusses the conflict between Ontology and Commonsense Knowledge (CK) in the context of Computer-Human Interaction/Communication. A resolution of this conflict is proposed, where Ontology is considered as a special case of CK (i.e. a formal CK). By this “rehabilitation” of Ontology to “CK Base”, we extend “by the way” the meaning and scope of Ontology to include “CK-based Ontology”. This new kind of ontology considers both definitional and schematic/situational knowledge. Moreover, we propose for this new kind of ontology an organizational scheme based on the use of Conceptual Structures (like Definition, Canon and Schematic Clusters).\nThe technical part presents the “implementation” of this theoretical framework in Amine platform [14] and especially in its Ontology layer. Amine’s ontology meta-model is presented as well as various Ontology/CKBase related processes.","authors":["Adil Kabbaj","Karim Mohamed Bouzoubaa","Khalid El Hachimi","Nabil Ourdani"],"meta":["July 2006Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/11787181_22","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Conceptual Structures: Inspiration and Application, 14th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS 2006, Aalborg, Denmark, July 16-21, 2006, Proceedings"],"references":["277294170_Spatial_Ontology_Baseline","265240316_Commonsense_ontology_and_semantics_of_natural_language","329648042_The_Big_Book_of_Concepts","291299243_Thinking_and_Problem_Solving","271018597_Women_Fire_and_Dangerous_Things","267090169_The_description_logic_handbook_Theory_implementation_and_applications_Reprint_of_the_2007_hardback_ed","265340290_Conceptual_structures_information_processing_in_mind_and_machine","262314091_Formal_Ontology_Conceptual_Analysis_and_Knowledge_Representation","248672970_Schmolze_An_overview_of_the_KL_-_ONE_knowledge_representation_system","247790139_The_Big_Book_of_Concepts"]}
