{"id":"266856549_Multicore-Optimized_Wavefront_Diamond_Blocking_for_Optimizing_Stencil_Updates","abstract":"The importance of stencil-based algorithms in computational science has\nfocused attention on optimized parallel implementations for multilevel\ncache-based processors. Temporal blocking schemes leverage the large bandwidth\nand low latency of caches to accelerate stencil updates and approach\ntheoretical peak performance. A key ingredient is the reduction of data traffic\nacross slow data paths, especially the main memory interface. In this work we\ncombine the ideas of multi-core wavefront temporal blocking and diamond tiling\nto arrive at stencil update schemes that show large reductions in memory\npressure compared to existing approaches. The resulting schemes show\nperformance advantages in bandwidth-starved situations, which are exacerbated\nby the high bytes per lattice update case of variable coefficients. Our thread\ngroups concept provides a controllable trade-off between concurrency and memory\nusage, shifting the pressure between the memory interface and the CPU. We\npresent performance results on a contemporary Intel processor.","authors":["Tareq Malas","Georg Hager","Hatem Ltaief","Holger Stengel"],"meta":["October 2014SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 37(4)","DOI:10.1137/140991133","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279288821_On_the_Scalability_of_Loop_Tiling_Techniques","273383916_The_Relation_Between_Diamond_Tiling_and_Hexagonal_Tiling","267157354_Quantifying_Performance_Bottlenecks_of_Stencil_Computations_Using_the_Execution-Cache-Memory_Model","266653845_A_stencil_compiler_for_short-vector_SIMD_architectures","262154124_Hybrid_HexagonalClassical_Tiling_for_GPUs","259476970_Tiling_Optimizations_For_Stencil_Computations","312835705_Jagged_Tiling_for_Intra-tile_Parallelism_and_Fine-Grain_Multithreading","261272238_Tiling_stencil_computations_to_maximize_parallelism","242331607_A_Roofline_Model_of_Energy","235666114_Hierarchical_parallelization_and_optimization_of_high-order_stencil_computations_on_multicore_clusters"]}
