{"id":"324267697_Embodiment_and_Grounding_in_Cognitive_Neuroscience","abstract":"Research in embodied and grounded cognition is defined by the types of hypotheses researchers pursue, with specific emphasis on the ways in which the body, brain, and environment interact to give rise to intelligent behavior. In cognitive neuroscience, it is hypothesized that simulations in modality‚Äêspecific representations, situated and embedded in a behavioral context, underlie our ability to plan actions, discuss our thoughts, and coordinate our activities with each other. In this framework, representations are powerful, predictive constructs, and integrate the brain (i.e., neural networks), body, and immediate environment. Overall, the grounded perspective encourages us to think deeply about our cognitive ontology, cognition's relation to the brain, and the dynamic processes that underlie our most complex behaviors. In this way, embodied and grounded perspectives promise to shape research in cognitive neuroscience in highly productive ways.","authors":["Heath E Matheson","Lawrence Barsalou"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1002/9781119170174.epcn310","In book: Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience (pp.1-27)"],"references":["330278823_Embodied_Cognition_and_Shakespeare's_Theatre_The_Early_Modern_Body-Mind","301645872_On_Staying_Grounded_and_Avoiding_Quixotic_Dead_Ends","286544003_Conceptual_grounding_of_language_in_action_and_perception_A_neurocomputational_model_of_the_emergence_of_category_specificity_and_semantic_hubs","283111821_Mental_Imagery_Functional_Mechanisms_and_Clinical_Applications","280535934_Embodied_Learning_of_a_Generative_Neural_Model_for_Biological_Motion_Perception_and_Inference","280220142_Routes_to_Embodiment","276529008_The_Embodied_Brain_Towards_a_Radical_Embodied_Cognitive_Neuroscience","274087989_Cognitive_Network_Neuroscience","271533999_Conceptual_issues_in_autism_spectrum_disorders","269692668_Mangen_A_Kuiken_D_2014_Lost_in_an_iPad_Narrative_engagement_on_paper_and_tablet","268794904_Contributions_of_cortical_feedback_to_sensory_processing_in_primary_visual_cortex","266944205_Accessing_Embodied_Object_Representations_From_Vision_A_Review","265912326_Are_Automatic_Conceptual_Cores_the_Gold_Standard_of_Semantic_Processing_The_Context-Dependence_of_Spatial_Meaning_in_Grounded_Congruency_Effects","263704380_Embodied_Effects_of_Conceptual_Knowledge_Continuously_Perturb_the_Hand_in_Flight","263293634_Thinking_in_circuits_toward_neurobiological_explanation_in_cognitive_neuroscience","260757119_From_sensorimotor_learning_to_memory_cells_in_prefrontal_and_temporal_association_cortex_A_neurocomputational_study_of_disembodiment","347908204_The_Student's_Guide_to_Cognitive_Neuroscience","321704681_The_embodied_mind_Cognitive_science_and_human_experience","319770401_Vision_A_Computational_Investigation_into_the_Human_Representation_and_Processing_of_Visual_Information","319393728_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","313757827_Distributed_memory_modular_systems_and_dysphagia_Current_perspectives_in_dysphagia","303890909_In_defense_of_abstract_conceptual_representations","303125726_A_logical_calculus_of_the_ideas_immanent_in_nervous_activity","300988378_COGNITION","298417858_The_Extended_Mind","291456260_All_concepts_are_ad_hoc_concepts","286815671_How_reading_comprehension_is_embodied_and_why_that_matters","285996852_Working_memory_Past_presentand_future","285307528_Word_in_the_brain's_language","282686072_The_embodied_brain_An_argument_from_neuroscience_for_radical_embodied_cognition","281769875_Moral_psychology_of_shame_in_early_confucian_philosophy","279236824_Situating_Abstract_Concepts","279234022_Grounding_Cognition_The_Role_of_Percpetion_and_Action_in_Language_Memory_and_Thinking","279233372_Steering_a_Course_for_Embodied_Representation","277815782_Cognitive_Neuroscience_The_Biology_of_the_Mind_Second_Edition","277251411_CSBBCS_at_Ryerson_University_and_the_Embodied_Cognition_Debate","274781011_Predicting_brain_activation_patterns_associated_with_individual_lexical_concepts_based_on_five_sensory-motor_attributes","273323903_Concept_Representation_Reflects_Multimodal_Abstraction_A_Framework_for_Embodied_Semantics","272746193_Embodied_Cognition","272160113_Minds_Brains_and_Programs","271880412_Embodiment_theory_and_education_The_foundations_of_cognition_in_perception_and_action","270960236_Six_views_of_embodied_cognition","270387814_Cognitive_Psychology","269425750_The_Modularity_of_Mind_An_Essay_on_Faculty_Psychology","267209705_Randomized_clinical_trial_to_evaluate_mental_practice_in_enhancing_advanced_laparoscopic_surgical_performance","266316724_Philosophy_in_The_Flesh_The_Embodied_Mind_And_Its_Challenge_To_Western_Thought","266316652_Supersizing_The_Mind_Embodiment_Action_and_Cognitive_Extension","260840533_Embodiment_and_language_comprehension_Reframing_the_discussion","258179737_How_Can_Functional_Neuroimaging_Inform_Cognitive_Theories","256202036_Introducing_the_special_topic_The_when_and_why_of_sensorimotor_processes_in_conceptual_knowledge_and_abstract_concepts","257797390_A_Moderate_Approach_to_Embodied_Cognitive_Science","257603642_Cognitive_Neuroscience_The_Biology_of_Mind","257529801_How_are_the_motor_system_activity_and_functional_connectivity_between_the_cognitive_and_sensorimotor_systems_modulated_by_athletic_expertise","254081505_Action's_Effect_on_Perception"]}
