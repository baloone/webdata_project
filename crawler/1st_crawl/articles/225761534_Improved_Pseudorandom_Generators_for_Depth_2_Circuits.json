{"id":"225761534_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","abstract":"We prove the existence of a poly(n,m)-time computable pseudorandom generator which “1/poly(n,m)-fools” DNFs with n variables and m terms, and has seed length O(log2\nnm ·loglognm). Previously, the best pseudorandom generator for depth-2 circuits had seed length O(log3\nnm), and was due to Bazzi (FOCS 2007).\n\nIt follows from our proof that a 1/m[(O)\\tilde](logmn)1/m^{\\tilde O(\\log mn)}-biased distribution 1/poly(nm)-fools DNFs with m terms and n variables. For inverse polynomial distinguishing probability this is nearly tight because we show that for every m,δ there is a 1/m\nΩ(log1/δ)-biased distribution X and a DNF φ with m terms such that φ is not δ-fooled by X.\n\nFor the case of read-once DNFs, we show that seed length O(logmn ·log1/δ) suffices, which is an improvement for large δ.\n\nIt also follows from our proof that a 1/m\n\nO(log1/δ)-biased distribution δ-fools all read-once DNF with m terms. We show that this result too is nearly tight, by constructing a 1/m[(W)\\tilde](log1/d)1/m^{\\tilde \\Omega(\\log 1/\\delta)}-biased distribution that does not δ-fool a certain m-term read-once DNF.\n\nKeywordsDNF-pseudorandom generators-small bias spaces","authors":["Anindya De","Omid Etesami","Luca Trevisan","Madhur Tulsiani"],"meta":["January 1970","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15369-3_38","In book: Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization.
