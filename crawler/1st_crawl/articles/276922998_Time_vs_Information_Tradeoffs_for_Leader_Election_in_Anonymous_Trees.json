{"id":"276922998_Time_vs_Information_Tradeoffs_for_Leader_Election_in_Anonymous_Trees","abstract":"The leader election task calls for all nodes of a network to agree on a\nsingle node. If the nodes of the network are anonymous, the task of leader\nelection is formulated as follows: every node $v$ of the network must output a\nsimple path, coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end\nat a common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader\nelection in anonymous trees.\nOur aim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\\tau$ and the\namount of information that has to be given $\\textit{a priori}$ to the nodes to\nenable leader election in time $\\tau$ in all trees for which leader election in\nthis time is at all possible. Following the framework of $\\textit{algorithms\nwith advice}$, this information (a single binary string) is provided to all\nnodes at the start by an oracle knowing the entire tree. The length of this\nstring is called the $\\textit{size of advice}$. For an allocated time $\\tau$,\nwe give upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to\nperform leader election in time $\\tau$.\nWe consider $n$-node trees of diameter $diam \\leq D$. While leader election\nin time $diam$ can be performed without any advice, for time $diam-1$ we give\ntight upper and lower bounds of $\\Theta (\\log D)$. For time $diam-2$ we give\ntight upper and lower bounds of $\\Theta (\\log D)$ for even values of $diam$,\nand tight upper and lower bounds of $\\Theta (\\log n)$ for odd values of $diam$.\nFor the time interval $[\\beta \\cdot diam, diam-3]$ for constant $\\beta >1/2$,\nwe prove an upper bound of $O(\\frac{n\\log n}{D})$ and a lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\frac{n}{D})$, the latter being valid whenever $diam$ is odd or when\nthe time is at most $diam-4$. Finally, for time $\\alpha \\cdot diam$ for any\nconstant $\\alpha <1/2$ (except for the case of very small diameters), we give\ntight upper and lower bounds of $\\Theta (n)$.","authors":["Christian Glacet","Avery Miller","Andrzej Pelc"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch44","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267869809_Election_vs_Selection_Two_Ways_of_Finding_the_Largest_Node_in_a_Graph","262399606_Knowledge_Level_of_Symmetry_and_Time_of_Leader_Election","286326051_Use_Knowledge_to_Learn_Faster_Topology_Recognition_with_Advice","286094567_Computing_on_an_anonymous_ring","262238486_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","245954051_Distributed_Algorithms_Chapter_6_7","243763312_Global_and_local_properties_in_networks_of_processors","239593861_Distributed_Computing_A_Locality-Sensitive_Approach","238759104_A_formal_model_for_message_passing_systems","234829122_Decentralized_Extrema-Finding_in_Circular_Configurations_of_Processors"]}
