{"id":"315514173_Algorithmic_Songwriting_with_ALYSIA","abstract":"This paper introduces ALYSIA: Automated LYrical SongwrIting Application. ALYSIA is based on a machine learning model using Random Forests, and we discuss its success at pitch and rhythm prediction. Next, we show how ALYSIA was used to create original pop songs that were subsequently recorded and produced. Finally, we discuss our vision for the future of Automated Songwriting for both co-creative and autonomous systems.","authors":["Margareta Ackerman","David Loker"],"meta":["March 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-55750-2_1","Conference: International Conference on Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired Music and Art"],"references":["320802679_Has_computational_creativity_successfully_made_it_Beyond_the_Fence_in_musical_theatre","301820373_SMUG_Scientific_Music_Generator","291386243_Tra-la-Lyrics_20_Automatic_Generation_of_Song_Lyrics_on_a_Semantic_Domain","253864384_Lyric-Based_Rhythm_Suggestion","242346600_Automatical_Composition_of_Lyrical_Songs","260039354_AI_Methods_in_Algorithmic_Composition_A_Comprehensive_Survey"]}
