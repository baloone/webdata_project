The relevant microstructural parameters, calculated in this way, finally are converted into mechanical properties by application Of Suitable algorithms. At ThyssenKrupp Stahl such a metallurgically oriented simulation system has been developed and established under the name TK-StripCam. It is based on empirical-physical models. It allows on the one hand to predict important mechanical properties with considerable precision from production parameters as rolling schedule, cooling conditions etc. On the other hand by means of the simulation system Course and kinetics of each metallurgical process included may be studied. It is evident that in a steel plant such a powerful tool finds a great variety of applications extending from offline use as a tool for development of steels and processes to inline use in the rolling mill to control the mechanical properties during production. In this work details of the philosophy and structure of the simulation system and examples for its application are presented.","authors":["U Lotter","HP Schmitz","L Zhang"],"meta":["December 2004Journal de Physique IV (Proceedings) 120:801-808","DOI:10.1051/jp4:2004120093","Conference: 2nd International Conference on Thermal Process Modelling and ComputerVolume: 120"],"references":[]}
