{"id":"221354656_One_Way_Hash_Functions_and_DES","abstract":"One way hash functions are a major tool in cryptography. DES is the best known and most widely used encryption function in\nthe commercial world today. Generating a one-way hash function which is secure if DES is a “good” block cipher would therefore\nbe useful. We show three such functions which are secure if DES is a good random block cipher.","authors":["Ralph C.
