{"id":"220374412_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_and_Teachers'_Decisions_Regarding_Use_of_Educational_Technology","abstract":"According to Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), behavioral intention (BI) is predicted by attitude toward the behavior (AB), subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Previous studies using the TPB to explain teachers' intentions to use technology have resulted in inconsistent findings. This inconsistency might be due to overly broad definitions of the target behavior. To investigate this potential weakness, we defined a specific target behavior, using computers only to create and deliver lessons, and then used the TPB to investigate teachers' decisions. An elicitation study was used to identify teachers' salient beliefs and develop a closed-ended questionnaire. Results of the closed-ended questionnaire revealed that AB, SN, and PBC all were significant predictors of teachers' intentions. However, AB had twice the influence of SN and three times that of PBC. This finding suggests that teachers must have positive attitudes about using computers to create and deliver lessons. They are less concerned about what others think of this practice, and far less bothered by internal or external constraints. Results provide specific information that can be used to design effective teacher development programs and remind TPB researchers of the importance of using specific definitions of the target behavior.
