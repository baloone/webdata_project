{"id":"265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","abstract":"We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN)\ntrained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification\ntasks. We first show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and\nstatic vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning\ntask-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance.\nWe additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for\nthe use of both task-specific and static word vectors. The CNN models discussed\nherein improve upon the state-of-the-art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include\nsentiment analysis and question classification.","authors":["Yoon Kim"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.3115/v1/D14-1181","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270878435_Semantic_Parsing_for_Single-Relation_Question_Answering","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","261961342_Learning_semantic_representations_using_convolutional_neural_networks_for_web_search","259893557_A_Statistical_Parsing_Framework_for_Sentiment_Classification","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","221654582_Mining_and_summarizing_customer_reviews","220817516_Dependency_Tree-based_Sentiment_Classification_using_CRFs_with_Hidden_Variables","220637945_From_symbolic_to_sub-symbolic_information_in_question_classification","220320677_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","319770276_CNN_Features_off-the-shelf_an_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","270878336_The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics","270877818_Political_Ideology_Detection_Using_Recursive_Neural_Networks","270877393_Context-aware_Learning_for_Sentence-level_Sentiment_Analysis_with_Posterior_Regularization","262367926_Semantic_Compositionality_through_Recursive_Matrix-Vector_Spaces","262204398_Baselines_and_Bigrams_Simple_Good_Sentiment_and_Topic_Classification","233981807_ADADELTA_An_adaptive_learning_rate_method","228890198_Annotating_Expressions_of_Opinions_and_Emotions_in","221101716_Learning_Question_Classifiers","221013323_Semi-Supervised_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Predicting_Sentiment_Distributions"]}
