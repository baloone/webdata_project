{"id":"328869353_Consistent_Discretization_of_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Stable_Systems","abstract":"Algorithms of implicit discretization for generalized homogeneous systems having a possible discontinuity only at the origin are developed. They are based on the transformation of the original system to an equivalent one which admits an implicit or a semi-implicit discretization scheme preserving the stability properties of the continuous-time system. Namely, the discretized model remains finite-time stable (in the case of negative homogeneity degree) and practically fixed-time stable (in the case of positive homogeneity degree). The theoretical results are supported with numerical examples.","authors":["Andrey Polyakov","Denis Efimov","Bernard Brogliato"],"meta":["January 2018SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization 57(1)","DOI:10.1137/18M1197345"],"references":["322693478_On_Homogeneous_Finite-Time_Control_for_Linear_Evolution_Equation_in_Hilbert_Space","313454190_Multivalued_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_Lagrange_Systems_Continuous_and_Discrete-Time_Algorithms","322883826_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_Using_Canonical_Homogeneous_Norm","322668802_Quadratic-like_stability_of_nonlinear_homogeneous_systems","321149997_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Observer_Design_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach","319477781_Experimental_Comparisons_Between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Implementations_of_Discrete-Time_Sliding_Mode_Controllers_Toward_Input_and_Output_Chattering_Suppression","316565096_Realization_and_Discretization_of_Asymptotically_Stable_Homogeneous_Systems","314244633_A_note_on_delay_robustness_for_homogeneous_systems_with_negative_degree","312110558_On_finite-time_stabilization_of_evolution_equations_A_homogeneous_approach","293014912_On_Homogeneous_Distributed_Parameter_Systems"]}
