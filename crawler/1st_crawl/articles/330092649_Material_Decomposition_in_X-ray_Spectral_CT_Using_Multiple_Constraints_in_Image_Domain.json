{"id":"330092649_Material_Decomposition_in_X-ray_Spectral_CT_Using_Multiple_Constraints_in_Image_Domain","abstract":"X-ray spectral CT appears as a new promising imaging modality for the quantitative measurement of materials in an object, compared to conventional energy-integrating CT or dual energy CT. We consider material decomposition in spectral CT as an overcomplete ill-conditioned inverse problem. To solve the problem, we make full use of multi-dimensional nature and high correlation of multi-energy data and spatially neighboring pixels in spectral CT. Meanwhile, we also exploit the fact that material mass density has limited value. The material decomposition is then achieved by using bounded mass density, local joint sparsity and structural low-rank (DSR) in image domain. The results on numerical phantom demonstrate that the proposed DSR method leads to more accurate decomposition than usual pseudo-inverse method with singular value decomposition (SVD) and current popular sparse regularization method with ℓ1-norm constraint. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","authors":["Bingqing Xie","Ting su","Valerie Kaftandjian","Pei Niu"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation 38(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10921-018-0551-8"],"references":["307959794_Spectral_CT_Reconstruction_With_Image_Sparsity_and_Spectral_Mean","283761902_An_algorithm_for_constrained_one-step_inversion_of_spectral_CT_data","266620771_Spectral_Diffusion_An_Algorithm_for_Robust_Material_Decomposition_of_Spectral_CT_Data","325406762_Image-domain_multi-material_decomposition_for_dual-energy_CT_based_on_prior_information_of_material_images","279731073_Performance_of_today's_dual_energy_CT_and_future_multi_energy_CT_in_virtual_non-contrast_imaging_and_in_iodine_quantification_A_simulation_study","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information","269322937_CT_calibration_and_dose_minimization_in_image-based_material_decomposition_with_energy-selective_detectors","263433321_Total_Nuclear_Variation_and_Jacobian_Extensions_of_Total_Variation_for_Vector_Fields","236538930_X-ray_attenuation_coefficients_total_cross_sections_Comparison_of_the_experimental_data_base_with_the_recommended_values_of_Henke_and_the_theoretical_values_of_Scofield_for_energies_between_0_1-100_ke","226758653_Decomposition_Method_with_a_Variable_Parameter_for_a_Class_of_Monotone_Variational_Inequality_Problems"]}
