{"id":"316583183_Solving_a_new_multi-objective_unrelated_parallel_machines_scheduling_problem_by_hybrid_teaching-learning_based_optimization","abstract":"This paper considers a scheduling problem of a set of independent jobs on unrelated parallel machines (UPMs) that minimizesthe maximum completion time (i.e., makespan or Cmax), maximum earliness (Emax), and maximum tardiness (Tmax) simultaneously. Jobs have non-identical due dates, sequence-dependent setup times and machine-dependentprocessing times. A multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is considered then solved with the ε-constraint method in small-sized problems.The related results are compared with the results obtained by meta-heuristic algorithms.Furthermore, an effectivehybrid multi-objective teaching-learningbased optimization (HMOTLBO) algorithm is proposed, whose performance is compared with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) fortest problems generated at random. The associated results show that the proposed HMOTLBO outperformsthe NSGA-II in terms of different metrics. © 2017, Materials and Energy Research Center. All rights reserved.","authors":["A.
