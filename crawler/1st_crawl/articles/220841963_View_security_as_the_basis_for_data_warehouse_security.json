{"id":"220841963_View_security_as_the_basis_for_data_warehouse_security","abstract":"Access. permissions in a data warehouse are currently managed in a separate world from the sources' policies. The consequences are inconsistencies, slow response to change, and wasted administrative work. We present a different approach, which treats the sources' exported tables and the warehouse as part of the same distributed database. Our main result is a way to control derived products by extending SQL grants rather than creating entirely new mechanisms. We provide a powerful, sound inference theory that derives permissions on warehouse tables (both materialized and virtual), making the system easier to administer and its applications more robust. We also propose a new permission construct suitable for views that filter data from mutually-suspicious parties.","authors":["Arnon Rosenthal","Edward Sciore"],"meta":["January 2000","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Second Intl.
