{"id":"332882193_Greek_Computer_Science_Teachers'_Training_Needs_Assessment","abstract":"The present study, following the results of a qualitative study that investigated the explicitly expressed, the felt (but not explicitly expressed) and the latent training needs of the computer science teachers of the Heraklion region of Greece, has questioned all computer science teachers in Greece (5865) to confirm or not the qualitative study results. This has resulted in the largest survey that has taken place for Greek computer science teachers training needs and the only one that is competency-based as far as teaching and pedagogical training needs are concerned. The aforementioned properties of the study enable the design of a three modules (Subject knowledge - Teaching methodology - Pedagogy) training program with explicit training goals; a training program that leaves little mismatch between training needed and training provided.","authors":["Giorgos Panselinas","Gerasimos Polymeris","Vasileios P.
