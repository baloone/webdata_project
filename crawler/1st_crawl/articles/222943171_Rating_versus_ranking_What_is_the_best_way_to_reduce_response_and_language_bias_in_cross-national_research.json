{"id":"222943171_Rating_versus_ranking_What_is_the_best_way_to_reduce_response_and_language_bias_in_cross-national_research","abstract":"We propose solutions to two recurring problems in cross-national research: response style differences and language bias. In order to do so, we conduct a methodological comparison of two different response formats—rating and ranking. For rating, we assess the effect of changing the commonly used 5-point Likert scales to 7-point Likert scales. For ranking, we evaluate the validity of presenting respondents with short scenarios for which they need to rank their top 3 solutions. Our results – based on two studies of 1965 undergraduate and 1714 MBA students in 16 different countries – confirm our hypotheses that both solutions reduce response and language bias, but show that ranking generally is a superior solution. These findings allow researchers to have greater confidence in the validity of cross-national differences if these response formats are used, instead of the more traditional 5-point Likert scales. In addition, our findings have several practical implications for multinational corporations, relating to issues such as selection interviews, performance appraisals, and cross-cultural training.","authors":["Anne-Wil Harzing","Joyce Baldueza","Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen","Cordula Barzantny"],"meta":["August 2009International Business Review 18(4):417-432","DOI:10.1016/j.ibusrev.2009.03.001","Projects: Social axioms and PersonalityReversing Babel?
