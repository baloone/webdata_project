{"id":"304525757_Some_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","abstract":"In many real world problems, data sometimes comes from n agents (n ≥ 2), i.e., “multipolar information” exists. This information cannot be well-represented by means of fuzzy graphs or bipolar fuzzy graphs. Therefore, m-polar fuzzy set theory is applied to graphs to describe the relationships among several individuals. In this paper, some operations are defined to formulate these graphs. Some properties of strong m-polar fuzzy graphs, self-complementary m-polar fuzzy graphs and self-complementary strong m-polar fuzzy graphs are discussed.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["June 2016Pacific Science Review A Natural Science and Engineering 18(1):38-46","DOI:10.1016/j.psra.2016.06.004","Project: Fuzzy graph"],"references":["304526053_Faces_and_dual_of_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","283005097_On_some_operations_and_density_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","292004369_Similar_relations_and_fuzzy_ordering","288869566_Is_there_a_need_for_fuzzy_logic","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
