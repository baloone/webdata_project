We will also discuss measures that define the effectiveness of IPS and finally the very recent work of standardization and homogenization of IPS. The purpose of this work is the design and the realization of an IDPS (intrusion detection and prevention system) inspired from natural immune systems. The study of biological systems to get inspired from them for the resolution of computer science problems is an axis of the artificial intelligence field which gave rise to robust and effective methods (ants colonies, genetic algorithms, neuron networksâ€¦) by their natural function, the immune system's the interest of researchers in the intrusion detection field, taking into account the similarities of NIS (Natural Immune System) and IDPS objectives. Within the framework of this work, we conceived an IDPS inspired from natural immune system and implemented by using a directed approach. A platform was developed and tests were carried out in order to assess our system performances.","authors":["Yousef Farhaoui"],"meta":["July 2017Procedia Computer Science 110(1):416-421","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.06.106","Project: Machine Learning contributions in decision making and its impact on the management of organizations in Big Data \""],"references":["261985615_Model_of_an_effective_Intrusion_Detection_System_On_the_LAN","261985360_Performance_Assessment_of_Tools_of_the_Intrusion_DetectionPrevention_Systems","258836662_PERFORMANCE_METHOD_OF_ASSESSMENT_OF_THE_INTRUSION_DETECTION_AND_PREVENTION_SYSTEMS","224751903_An_intrusion_detection_system_using_ideas_from_the_immune_system","29614037_Application_du_systeme_immunitaire_artificiel_pour_la_reconnaissance_des_chiffres","3418695_Learning_and_Optimization_Using_the_Clonal_Selection_Principle","250816409_An_intrusion_detection_system_based_on_immune_mechanisms","228630471_CLONAL_SELECTION_THEORY_CLONALG_THE_CLONAL_SELECTION_CLASSIFICATION_ALGORITHM_CSCA","222682786_The_construction_of_a_Boolean_competitive_neural_network_using_ideas_from_immunology","220803207_Applying_Similarities_Between_Immune_Systems_And_Mobile_Agent_Systems_In_Intrusion_Detection","2603067_Immunity_by_Design_An_Artificial_Immune_System","2425122_Artificial_Immune_Systems_Part_II_-_A_Survey_Of_Applications","2366860_An_Evaluation_of_Negative_Selection_in_an_Artificial_Immune_System_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection"]}
