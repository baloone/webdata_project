{"id":"283389609_Embedding_academic_socialisation_within_a_language_support_program_An_Australian_case_study","abstract":"This paper describes discipline-specific transition support utilised to follow-up the Post-Entry Language Assessment (PELA) recently introduced at Edith Cowan University as one strategy to address declining rates of English language proficiency. Transition support was embedded within a first year core unit and emphasis was placed on assisting students to develop spoken and written communicative competencies by scaffolding assessment tasks and providing other academic supports that used contextualised examples. While general satisfaction with the academic support offered during the course was high, the program achieved limited success in encouraging at-risk students to seek support. Further investigation into methods of encouraging student participation is required, along with research into strategies for extending effective academic socialisation support into the online learning environment.","authors":["Shelley E Beatty","Ashok Collins","Maureen Buckingham"],"meta":["February 2014The International Journal of the First Year in Higher Education 5(1)","DOI:10.5204/intjfyhe.v5i1.180","Project: Effective Communications Skills in Nursing Practice"],"references":["304630199_Effective_teaching_and_support_of_students_from_low_socioeconomic_status_backgrounds_Practical_advice_for_institutional_policy_makers_and_leaders","286327739_The_Impact_of_English_Language_Proficiency_and_Workplace_Readiness_on_the_Employment_Outcomes_of_Tertiary_International_Students","252475788_Peer_Evaluation_as_an_Active_Learning_Technique","330349249_I'll_go_with_the_group_Rethinking_'discourse_community'_in_EAP","313015422_Incoming_first_year_undergraduate_students_How_information_literate_are_they","284696260_Clothing_the_emperor_Addressing_the_issues_of_English_language_proficiency_in_Australian_Universities","267375266_The_IDEALL_approach_to_Learning_Development_a_model_for_fostering_improved_literacy_and_learning_outcomes_for_students","262565174_The_IDEALL_approach_to_Learning_Development_a_model_for_fostering_improved_literacy_and_learning_outcomes_for_students","254340831_Embedding_information_literacy_in_a_first-year_business_undergraduate_course","248962993_Student_experience_and_tertiary_expectations_Factors_predicting_academic_literacy_amongst_first-year_pharmacy_students"]}
