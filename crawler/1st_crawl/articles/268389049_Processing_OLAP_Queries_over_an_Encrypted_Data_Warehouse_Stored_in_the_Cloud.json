{"id":"268389049_Processing_OLAP_Queries_over_an_Encrypted_Data_Warehouse_Stored_in_the_Cloud","abstract":"Several studies deal with mechanisms for processing transactional queries over encrypted data. However, little attention has been devoted to determine how a data warehouse (DW) hosted in a cloud should be encrypted to enable analytical queries processing. In this article, we present a novel method for encrypting a DW and show performance results of this DW implementation. Moreover, an OLAP system based on the proposed encryption method was developed and performance tests were conducted to validate our system in terms of query processing performance. Results showed that the overhead caused by the proposed encryption method decreased when the proposed system was scaled out and compared to a non-encrypted dataset (46.62% with one node and 9.47% with 16 nodes). Also, the computation of aggregates and data groupings over encrypted data in the server produced performance gains (from 84.67% to 93.95%) when compared to their executions in the client, after decryption.","authors":["Claudivan Cruz Lopes","Val√©ria C.
