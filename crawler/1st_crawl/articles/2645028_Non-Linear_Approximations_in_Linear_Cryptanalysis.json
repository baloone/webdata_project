{"id":"2645028_Non-Linear_Approximations_in_Linear_Cryptanalysis","abstract":". By considering the role of non-linear approximations in linear cryptanalysis we obtain a generalization of Matsui's linear cryptanalytic techniques. This approach allows the cryptanalyst greater flexibility in mounting a linear cryptanalytic attack and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear techniques with some simple attacks on LOKI91. These attacks potentially allow for the recovery of seven additional bits of key information with less than 1=4 of the plaintext that is required using current linear cryptanalytic methods. 1 Introduction The technique of linear cryptanalysis [7] is now well known. Most dramatically it has provided the first experimental (though barely practical) compromise [8] of the Data Encryption Standard DES [9]. In addition to some theoretical and practical enhancements or extensions to linear cryptanalysis [4, 6, 11] it is natural to consider whether the linear approximations on which linear cryptanalysis relies can be replaced with non-li...","authors":["Lars Ramkilde Knudsen"],"meta":["November 1998"],"references":["2729292_Improving_Resistance_to_Differential_Cryptanalysis_and_the_Redesign_of_LOKI","313472629_Differentially_uniform_mappings_for_cryptography","303170914_Linear_Cryptanalysis_Method_for_DES_Cipher","293222358_Truncated_differential-linear_cryptanalysis","285332458_Differential-Linear_Cryptanalysis","284421904_Linear_cryptanalysis_of_the_data_encryption_standard","242459898_Cryptography_and_Computer_Privacy","226556559_Linear_Cryptanalysis_Using_Multiple_Approximations","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III","225386411_A_Generalization_of_Linear_Cryptanalysis_and_the_Applicability_of_Matsui's_Piling-up_Lemma","225181790_Di_erentially_uniform_mappings_for_cryptography","221355310_Linear_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Fast_Data_Encipherment_Algorithm","221355075_The_First_Experimental_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Data_Encryption_Standard","221348203_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Data_Encryption_Standard_by_the_Method_of_Formal_Coding","221347868_Linear_Approximation_of_Block_Ciphers","220942440_Linear_Cryptanalysis_Using_Multiple_Approximations_and_FEAL","2635689_Linear_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Fast_Data_Encipherment_Algorithm","2629038_Provable_Security_Against_a_Differential_Attack","2239902_A_Generalization_of_Linear_Cryptanalysis_and_the_Applicability_of_Matsui's_Piling-up_Lemma"]}
