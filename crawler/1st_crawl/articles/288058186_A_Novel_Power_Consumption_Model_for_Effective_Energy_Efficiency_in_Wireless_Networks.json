{"id":"288058186_A_Novel_Power_Consumption_Model_for_Effective_Energy_Efficiency_in_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"Designing energy-efficient delay-aware communication networks have become an inevitable trend in 5G wireless networks. In this letter, we present an energy-efficient and delay-aware cross-layer resource allocation in SISO wireless systems. To achieve this goal, we apply the notion of effective energy efficiency (EEE), defined as the ratio of the system effective capacity (EC) over the total power consumption. Unlike previous works, we introduce a new average power consumption model which accounts for the data link layer, allowing for the probability of emptying the buffer during the transmission timeframe. This leads to a new definition of EEE, which results in better performance in terms of both EEE and EC.","authors":["Mahnaz Sinaie","Alessio Zappone","Eduard Jorswieck","Paeiz Azmi"],"meta":["April 2016IEEE Wireless Communication Letters 5(2):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LWC.2015.2512259"],"references":["280873356_A_Survey_of_5G_Network_Architecture_and_Emerging_Technologies","279865710_Energy_sharing_within_EH-enabled_wireless_communication_networks","279274470_Energy_Efficiency_in_Wireless_Networks_via_Fractional_Programming_Theory","275673965_Recent_advances_in_energy-efficient_networks_and_their_application_in_5G_systems","275647909_QoS-Constrained_Energy_Efficiency_of_Cooperative_ARQ_in_Multiple_DF_Relay_Systems","263471776_Wireless_Networks_With_RF_Energy_Harvesting_A_Contemporary_Survey","262568766_On_Green_Energy_Powered_Cognitive_Radio_Networks","261044991_Wireless_Information_and_Power_Transfer_Energy_Efficiency_Optimization_in_OFDMA_Systems","260873145_Throughput_Optimization_for_Massive_MIMO_Systems_Powered_by_Wireless_Energy_Transfer","260534069_Energy-Efficient_Power_Allocation_for_Pilots_in_Training-Based_Downlink_OFDMA_Systems","255731327_Wireless_Information_and_Power_Transfer_in_Multiuser_OFDM_Systems","233947212_On_the_Complexity_of_Joint_Subcarrier_and_Power_Allocation_for_Multi-User_OFDMA_Systems","224904999_Wireless_Information_and_Power_Transfer_Architecture_Design_and_Rate-Energy_Tradeoff","223129967_Wireless_Information_Transfer_with_Opportunistic_Energy_Harvesting","221286627_MIMO_Broadcasting_for_Simultaneous_Wireless_Information_and_Power_Transfer","220589447_Algorithms_for_generalized_fractional_programming","3086308_Resource_Allocation_and_Quality_of_Service_Evaluation_for_Wireless_Communication_Systems_Using_Fluid_Models","2394123_Multiuser_OFDM_with_Adaptive_Subcarrier_Bit_and_Power_Allocation","316732008_Secure_SWIPT_Networks_Based_on_a_Non-Linear_Energy_Harvesting_Model","306087974_Statistical-QoS_Driven_Energy-Efficiency_Optimization_Over_Green_5G_Mobile_Wireless_Networks","305676083_Data_and_energy_cooperation_in_relay-enhanced_OFDM_systems","297246094_STABILITY_QUEUE_LENGTH_AND_DELAY_OF_DETERMINISTIC_AND_STOCHASTIC_QUEUING-NETWORKS","285006810_Energy_Efficiency_and_Interference_Neutralization_in_Two-Hop_MIMO_Interference_Channels","282540005_Maximising_Energy_Efficiency_in_Multi-User_Multi-Carrier_Broadband_Wireless_Systems_Convex_Relaxation_and_Global_Optimisation_Techniques","272890515_QoS-driven_resource_allocation_in_green_OFDMA_wireless_networks","270222232_Wireless_Information_and_Energy_Transfer_for_Two-Hop_Non-Regenerative_MIMO-OFDM_Relay_Networks","265252225_Simultaneous_Wireless_Information_and_Power_Transfer_in_Modern_Communication_Systems","264625425_Energy-Efficient_Power_Allocation_Over_Nakagami-_Fading_Channels_Under_Delay-Outage_Constraints","263094241_Energy-Efficient_Power_Allocation_for_Delay-Sensitive_Multimedia_Traffic_Over_Wireless_Systems","263035686_Optimal_Cooperative_Power_Allocation_for_Energy_Harvesting_Enabled_Relay_Networks","261491641_Energy-efficient_power_allocation_for_delay-sensitive_traffic_over_wireless_systems","261271621_Energy-efficient_power_allocation_in_OFDM_systems_with_wireless_information_and_power_transfer","260635479_Joint_Spectrum_and_Power_Efficiencies_Optimization_for_Statistical_QoS_Provisionings_Over_SISOMIMO_Wireless_Networks","260514003_Energy-Efficient_Power_Adaptation_over_a_Frequency-Selective_Fading_Channel_with_Delay_and_Power_Constraints","260513981_Energy-Efficient_Design_for_Downlink_OFDMA_with_Delay-Sensitive_Traffic","259092509_Full_passive_UHF_RFID_Tag_with_an_ultra-low_power_small_area_high_resolution_temperature_sensor_suitable_for_environment_monitoring","235671982_MIMO_wireless_communications","235656669_Opportunistic_Wireless_Energy_Harvesting_in_Cognitive_Radio_Networks","227443128_On_Nonlinear_Fractional_Programming","224324893_Transporting_Information_and_Energy_Simultaneously","224157865_Shannon_meets_Tesla_Wireless_information_and_power_transfer","222602510_Fractional_programming","220086073_Dual_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Spectrum_Optimization_of_Multicarrier_Systems","41031288_QoS-driven_adaptive_resource_allocation_for_mobile_wireless_communications_and_networks","3434595_Cross-Layer-Model_Based_Adaptive_Resource_Allocation_for_Statistical_QoS_Guarantees_in_Mobile_Wireless_Networks","3434297_Cross-layer_modeling_for_quality_of_service_guarantees_over_wireless_links","3432720_Effective_capacity_A_wireless_link_model_for_support_of_quality_of_service","3155400_Utilizing_Multiuser_Diversity_for_Efficient_Support_of_Quality_of_Service_Over_a_Fading_Channel","3021821_Stability_queue_length_and_delay_of_deterministic_and_stochastic_queueing_networks"]}
