{"id":"329743801_Planar_Shape_Detection_at_Structural_Scales","abstract":"Interpreting 3D data such as point clouds or surface meshes depends heavily on the scale of observation. Yet, existing algorithms for shape detection rely on trial-and-error parameter tunings to output configurations representative of a structural scale. We present a framework to automatically extract a set of representations that capture the shape and structure of man-made objects at different key Abstraction levels. A shape-collapsing process first generates a fine-to-coarse sequence of shape representations by exploiting local planarity. This sequence is then analyzed to identify significant geometric variations between successive representations through a supervised energy minimization. Our framework is flexible enough to learn how to detect both existing structural formalisms such as the CityGML Levels Of Details, and expert-specified levels of Abstraction. Experiments on different input data and classes of man-made objects, as well as comparisons with existing shape detection methods, illustrate the strengths of our approach in terms of efficiency and flexibility.","authors":["Hao Fang","Florent Lafarge","Mathieu Desbrun"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2018.00313","Conference: 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)"],"references":["318726301_PolyFit_Polygonal_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","282863793_Object_Classification_via_Planar_Abstraction","276458701_LOD_Generation_for_Urban_Scenes","276204947_A_Mixture_of_Manhattan_Frames_Beyond_the_Manhattan_World","275960895_RAPTER_Rebuilding_Man-made_Scenes_with_Regular_Arrangements_of_Planes","271551255_SUN3D_A_Database_of_Big_Spaces_Reconstructed_Using_SfM_and_Object_Labels","262237052_Monocular_Object_Detection_Using_3D_Geometric_Primitives","262157586_Growing_Least_Squares_for_the_Analysis_of_Manifolds_in_Scale-Space","260230594_Fast_place_recognition_with_plane-based_maps","234979646_The_Random_Cluster_Model_for_Robust_Geometric_Fitting","228754371_The_3D_Hough_Transform_for_plane_detection_in_point_clouds_A_review_and_a_new_accumulator_design","228340970_Segmentation_of_point_clouds_using_smoothness_constraint","224297791_Scale-Dependent_3D_Geometric_Features","224136139_Shape-based_recognition_of_3D_point_clouds_in_urban_environments","221304253_Hough_Transform_and_3D_SURF_for_Robust_Three_Dimensional_Classification","221110968_Piecewise_Planar_Stereo_for_Image-based_Rendering","220660141_Energy-Based_Geometric_Multi-model_Fitting","220184400_Abstraction_of_Man-Made_Shapes","4082577_The_Princeton_Shape_Benchmark","308861868_3D_ShapeNets_A_deep_representation_for_volumetric_shapes","286679738_Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_3D_scene_labeling","279830555_Planar_Shape_Detection_and_Regularization_in_Tandem","279384889_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","279354924_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","279354845_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","264984988_Piecewise-Planar_3D_Reconstruction_with_Edge_and_Corner_Regularization","261116246_Robust_plane-based_structure_from_motion","259445364_3D_Interest_Point_Detection_via_Discriminative_Learning","257346534_CityGML_-_Interoperable_semantic_3D_city_models","242361029_Level_of_Detail_for_3D_Graphics","227747234_Multi-scale_Feature_Extraction_on_Point-Sampled_Surfaces","221364112_Robust_Piecewise-Planar_3D_Reconstruction_and_Completion_from_Large-Scale_Unstructured_Point_Data","220660250_Architectural_Modeling_from_Sparsely_Scanned_Range_Data","220505939_Efficient_RANSAC_for_point-cloud_shape_detection","51574325_High_Accuracy_and_Visibility-Consistent_Dense_Multiview_Stereo","4150763_Scale_selection_for_classification_of_point-sampled_3D_surfaces","3192976_Using_Spin_Images_for_Efficient_Object_Recognition_in_Cluttered_3D_Scenes","3081191_Error_Bounds_for_Convolutional_Codes_and_an_Asymptotically_Optimum_Decoding_Algorithm"]}
