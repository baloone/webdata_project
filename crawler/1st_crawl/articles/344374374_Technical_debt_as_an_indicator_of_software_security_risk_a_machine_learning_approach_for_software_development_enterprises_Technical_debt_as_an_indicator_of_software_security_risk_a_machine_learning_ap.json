Although several factors have been studied for their ability to indicate software security risk, very limited attention has been given to technical debt (TD), despite its potential relevance to software security. To this end, in the present study, we investigate the ability of common TD indicators to indicate security risks in software products, both at project-level and at class-level of granularity. Our findings suggest that TD indicators may potentially act as security indicators as well.
