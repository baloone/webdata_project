{"id":"308877674_Review_of_Particle_Physics","abstract":"This biennial Review summarizes much of Particle Physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2205 new measurements from 667 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. This edition features expanded coverage of CP violation in B mesons and of neutrino oscillations. For the first time we cover searches for evidence of extra dimensions (both in the particle listings and in a new review). Another new review is on Grand Unified Theories. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: http://pdg.lbl.gov","authors":["Claudia Patrignani"],"meta":["July 2002Chinese Physics C 40(10)","DOI:10.1088/1674-1137/40/10/100001"],"references":["305894123_Measurement_of_the_double-differential_high-mass_Drell-Yan_cross_section_in_pp_collisions_at_s_8_sqrts8_TeV_with_the_ATLAS_detector","259967431_KLS--ppnn_decays_within_and_beyond_the_standard_model","258069498_Summing_Sudakov_logarithms_in_BXsg_in_effective_field_theory","235464493_Long-distance_effects_in_B_V_g_radiative_weak_decays","2154418_Hybrid_and_Conventional_Baryons_in_the_Flux-Tube_Model","2003173_On_Axion_Thermalization_in_the_Early_Universe","281569414_Search_for_H_to_gammagamma_produced_in_association_with_top_quarks_and_constraints_on_the_Yukawa_coupling_between_the_top_quark_and_the_Higgs_boson_using_data_taken_at_7_TeV_and_8_TeV_with_the_ATLAS_d","278622696_Search_for_W'tb_in_the_lepton_plus_jets_final_state_in_proton-proton_collisions_at_a_centre-of-mass_energy_of_s_8_TeV_with_the_ATLAS_detector","242299966_Study_of_SUSY_signatures_at_the_Fermilab_Tevatron_in_models_with_near_mass_degeneracy_of_the_lightest_chargino_and_neutralino","235565580_Flavor_changing_effects_in_theories_with_a_heavy_Z'_boson_with_family_nonuniversal_couplings","235497548_The_Possibility_of_Large_Direct_CP_Violation_in_B_to_K_pi-Like_Modes_Due_to_Long_Distance_Rescattering_Effects_and_Implications_for_the_Angle_gamma","235457106_Supersymmetric_grand_unification_under_siege_Proton_lifetime_upper_bound","224927148_Measurement_of_the_top_quark_pair_cross_section_with_ATLAS_in_pp_collisions_at_sqrts_7_TeV_using_final_states_with_an_electron_or_a_muon_and_a_hadronically_decaying_tau_lepton","222464446_The_fate_of_primordial_magnetic_monopoles","222292666_On_the_oscillations_of_neutrinos_with_Dirac_and_Majorana_masses","2001470_Kaluza-Klein_States_of_the_Standard_Model_Gauge_Bosons_Constraints_From_High_Energy_Experiments","2000886_Soft-Collinear_Factorization_in_Effective_Field_Theory","1998644_Light-cone_distribution_functions_for_B_decays_at_subleading_order_in_1mb"]}
