{"id":"269417399_Logic_of_temporal_attribute_implications","abstract":"We study logic for reasoning with if-then formulas describing dependencies\nbetween attributes of objects which are observed in consecutive points in time.\nWe introduce semantic entailment of the formulas, show its fixed-point\ncharacterization, investigate closure properties of model classes, present an\naxiomatization and prove its completeness, and investigate alternative\naxiomatizations and normalized proofs. We investigate decidability and\ncomplexity issues of the logic and prove NP-hardness of the entailment problem.\nWe show that by restricting to predictive formulas, the entailment problem is\ndecidable in pseudo-linear time.","authors":["Jan Triska","Vilem Vychodil"],"meta":["April 2017Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 79(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10472-016-9526-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["323579717_Minimal_bases_of_temporal_attribute_implications","307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","344914633_Chapter_2_Relational_Algebra","344486660_Modal_Logic","321516863_Time_Granularities_in_Databases_Data_Mining_and_Temporal_Reasoning","320839043_Two_Basic_Algorithms_in_Concept_Analysis","313606501_Mining_Association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","313514563_On_a_generalization_of_quantifiers","301928769_Towards_Armstrong-Style_Inference_System_for_Attribute_Implications_with_Temporal_Semantics","301850539_Exploiting_Functional_Dependencies_in_Qualitative_Probabilistic_Reasoning","271658085_Characterizing_functional_dependencies_in_formal_concept_analysis_with_pattern_structures","285336589_Artificial_intelligence_and_mathematical_theory_of_computation","284528353_A_Machine-Oriented_Logic_based_on_the_Resolution_Principle","278690128_Knapsack_Problems","271371699_Functional_Dependencies_on_Symbol_Strings_Generated_by_Extended_Context_Free_Languages"]}
