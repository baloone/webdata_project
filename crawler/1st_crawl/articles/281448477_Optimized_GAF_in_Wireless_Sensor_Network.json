{"id":"281448477_Optimized_GAF_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","abstract":"The popularity of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has increased tremendously in recent times. WSN connects the physical world with the virtual world by forming a network of sensor nodes. In a sensor network the sensor nodes sense the data within their sensing range. Each node has limited energy which is used in transmitting and receiving the data thus energy preservation is most important for the survival of sensor networks for longer period time. Many routing protocols in WSN are used for the same purpose. In WSN, Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) is a location based routing protocol which transmits data on the basis of location information of destination node. It works in three phases i.e. discovery phase, sleeping phase and active phase. This paper proposes a mechanism to improve the discovery phase and reduces the energy used by nodes in discovery phase and increases the lifetime of network. Implementation of proposed Optimized GAF protocol is done using MATLAB.","authors":["Jitender Grover","Shikha Sharma","Mohit Sharma"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014686","Conference: IEEE 3rd International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (ICRITO 2014)At: Amity University, Noida","Project: Wireless Sensor Network implementation"],"references":["266486225_Geographic_Adaptive_Fidelity_and_Geographic_Energy_Aware_Routing_in_Ad_Hoc_Routing_Geographic_Adaptive_Fidelity_and_Geographic_Energy_Aware_Routing_in_Ad_Hoc_Routing","265892809_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Protocols_and_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_-_A_Survey_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Protocols_and_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey_Energy_Efficient_Routi","262077749_GAFBone_A_New_Backbone_Construction_for_Increasing_Lifetime_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","259220460_Hierarchical_Low_Power_Consumption_Technique_with_Location_Information_for_Sensor_Networks","237100260_A_Survey_on_Energy_Efficient_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221541114_Evaluation_of_OnOff_Scheduling_Protocols_for_Ad_Hoc_and_Sensor_Networks","4323450_LSDC_a_lossless_approach_to_lifetime_maximization_in_wireless_sensor_networks","4323131_Buferng_techniques_in_sleep_doze_coordination_and_grid_based_clustering_protocols_as_power_management_schemes_for_wireless_sensor_networks","4127827_Sensor-DMAC_dynamic_topology_control_for_wireless_sensor_networks","292067785_Study_of_energy_efficient_routing_protocols_of_wireless_sensor_networks_and_their_further_researches_A_survey","283008533_Comparative_study_of_LEACH_LEACH-C_and_PEGASIS_routing_protocols_for_wireless_sensor_network","262319143_Energy_conservation_for_wireless_mobile_ad_hoc_networks_using_hexagonal_GAF_protocol","224131808_GAFCo_Connectivity_Aware_Topology_Management_for_Sensor_Networks","220586729_HGAF_A_Power_Saving_Scheme_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","4193695_Minimum-energy_data_dissemination_in_coordination-based_sensor_networks","2367993_Geography-informed_Energy_Conservation_for_Ad_Hoc_Routing"]}
