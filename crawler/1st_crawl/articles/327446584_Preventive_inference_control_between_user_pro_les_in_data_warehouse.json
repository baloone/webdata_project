{"id":"327446584_Preventive_inference_control_between_user_pro_les_in_data_warehouse","abstract":"The detections of inferences between multidimensional queries tend to be more sensitive than data separately. These combinations must be modeled in order to avoid the inference of unauthorized data. However, no work has dealt with inference management in the case of a user who combines two or more permissions. In this paper, we present our approach that focuses on detecting inferences of sensitive data of DW (Data Warehouse) by a user occupying one or more profiles within the company, using the graphical presentation of the permissions and Exploiting associations of source databases.","authors":["Amina Elouazzani","Salah Ouederrou","Sara Ibn El Ahrache","E L Ahrache"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Next Generation Information Technology 9(2):99"],"references":["305476303_An_extended_access_control_mechanism_exploiting_data_dependencies","281289336_Inference_Control_in_Data_Integration_Systems","221038623_Towards_the_Secure_Modelling_of_OLAP_Users'_Behaviour","220841963_View_security_as_the_basis_for_data_warehouse_security","312411369_Dynamic_management_of_data_warehouse_security_levels_based_on_user_profiles","309639578_Protecting_Sensitive_Warehouse_Data_through_UML_based_Modeling","284332229_k-Anonymity_A_Model_for_Protecting_Privacy","223571120_Building_a_secure_star_schema_in_data_warehouses_by_an_extension_of_the_relational_package_from_CWM","222820160_Access_control_and_audit_model_for_the_multidimensional_modeling_of_data_warehouses","221609071_Assessing_query_privileges_via_safe_and_efficient_permission_composition","220349216_Designing_Secure_Data_Warehouses_by_Using_MDA_and_QVT","2413225_Building_Secure_Data_Warehouse_Schemas_from_Federated_Information_Systems","220147129_A_Study_on_Secure_Data_Storage_Strategy_in_Cloud_Computing"]}
