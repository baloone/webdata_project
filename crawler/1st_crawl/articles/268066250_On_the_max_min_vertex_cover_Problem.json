{"id":"268066250_On_the_max_min_vertex_cover_Problem","abstract":"We address the max min vertex cover problem, which is the maximization version of the well studied min independent dominating set problem, known to be NP-hard and highly inapproximable in polynomial time. We present tight approximation results for this problem on general graphs, namely a polynomial approximation algorithm which guarantees an n\n− 1/2 approximation ratio, while showing that unless P = NP, the problem is inapproximable within ratio n\nε − (1/2) for any strictly positive ε. We also analyze the problem on various restricted classes of graph, on which we show polynomiality or constant-approximability of the problem. Finally, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the size of an optimal solution, to treewidth and to the size of a maximum matching.","authors":["Nicolas Boria","Federico Della Croce","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["June 2014Discrete Applied Mathematics 196","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08001-7_4","Conference: International Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms"],"references":["279293211_New_Results_on_Polynomial_Inapproximabilityand_Fixed_Parameter_Approximability_of_Edge_Dominating_Set","226956676_On_Turan's_theorem_for_sparse_graphs","226785142_On_Parameterized_Approximability","225636325_Maximum_Matchings_in_Planar_Graphs_via_Gaussian_Elimination","225449378_Fixed-Parameter_Approximation_Conceptual_Framework_and_Approximability_Results","225437095_Parameterized_Approximation_Problems","220770783_Dynamic_Programming_on_Tree_Decompositions_Using_Generalised_Fast_Subset_Convolution","220753134_Linear-Time_Counting_Algorithms_for_Independent_Sets_in_Chordal_Graphs","220137887_On_Parameterized_Approximability","46716333_Dynamic_programming_on_tree_decompositions_using_generalised_fast_subset_convolution","4109345_Maximum_matchings_via_Gaussian_elimination","2420947_Low-degree_Graph_Partitioning_via_Local_Search_with_Applications_to_Constraint_Satisfaction_Max_Cut_and_Coloring","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","262311996_New_Results_on_Polynomial_Inapproximabilityand_Fixed_Parameter_Approximability_of_Edge_Dominating_Set","262309386_Parameterized_Approximation_via_Fidelity_Preserving_Transformations","230595938_Independent_domination_in_chordal_graphs","225971608_Efficient_algorithms_for_combinatorial_problems_on_graphs_with_bounded_decomposability_-_A_survey","225474017_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Dominating_Set_Problem_on_Some_Graph_Classes","223117539_Approximating_the_minimum_maximal_independence_number","222628100_Domination_independent_domination_and_duality_in_strongly_chordal_graphs","222037836_Linear_Time_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_Restricted_to_Partial_k-Trees","221543918_Hardness_of_Approximating_Independent_Domination_in_Circle_Graphs","220992949_Parameterized_Approximation_Problems","220897350_The_Approximation_of_Maximum_Subgraph_Problems","220752465_A_Branch-and-Reduce_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Minimum_Independent_Dominating_Set_in_Graphs","220568991_Approximation_of_MAX_INDEPENDENT_SET_MIN_VERTEX_COVER_and_related_problems_by_moderately_exponential_algorithms","220390496_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Dominating_Set_Problem_on_Some_Graph_Classes","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","220112015_Parameterized_approximation_of_dominating_set_problems","46213534_Fast_Algorithms_for_min_independent_dominating_set","2527856_Dynamic_Programming_On_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth"]}
