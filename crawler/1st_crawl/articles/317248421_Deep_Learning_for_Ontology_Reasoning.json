{"id":"317248421_Deep_Learning_for_Ontology_Reasoning","abstract":"In this work, we present a novel approach to ontology reasoning that is based on deep learning rather than logic-based formal reasoning. To this end, we introduce a new model for statistical relational learning that is built upon deep recursive neural networks, and give experimental evidence that it can easily compete with, or even outperform, existing logic-based reasoners on the task of ontology reasoning. More precisely, we compared our implemented system with one of the best logic-based ontology reasoners at present, RDFox, on a number of large standard benchmark datasets, and found that our system attained high reasoning quality, while being up to two orders of magnitude faster.","authors":["Patrick Hohenecker","Thomas Lukasiewicz"],"meta":["May 2017"],"references":["303969790_Logic_Tensor_Networks_Deep_Learning_and_Logical_Reasoning_from_Data_and_Knowledge","303854974_Parallel_OWL_2_RL_Materialisation_in_Centralised_Main-Memory_RDF_Systems","301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","300338060_RDFox_A_Highly-Scalable_RDF_Store","226235487_Towards_a_Complete_OWL_Ontology_Benchmark","221345089_A_Three-Way_Model_for_Collective_Learning_on_Multi-Relational_Data","3652002_Learning_task-dependent_distributed_representations_by_backpropagation_through_structure","319770263_Reasoning_With_Neural_Tensor_Networks_for_Knowledge_Base_Completion","291295837_Reasoning_with_neural_tensor_networks_for_knowledge_base_completion","288250868_A_Review_of_Relational_Machine_Learning_for_Knowledge_Graphs","271131716_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","265793418_Introduction_to_Statistical_Relational_Learning_Adaptive_Computation_and_Machine_Learning","259440895_Can_recursive_neural_tensor_networks_learn_logical_reasoning","222830276_LUBM_a_benchmark_for_OWL_knowledge_base_systems","222705922_DBpedia_-_A_Crystallization_Point_for_the_Web_of_Data","222452495_Recursive_Distributed_Representations","45885057_PyCUDA_and_PyOpenCL_a_scripting-based_approach_to_GPU_run-time_code_generation"]}
