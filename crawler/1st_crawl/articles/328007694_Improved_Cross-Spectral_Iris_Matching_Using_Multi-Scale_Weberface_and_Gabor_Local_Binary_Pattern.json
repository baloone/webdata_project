{"id":"328007694_Improved_Cross-Spectral_Iris_Matching_Using_Multi-Scale_Weberface_and_Gabor_Local_Binary_Pattern","abstract":"Iris matching is widely used in various biometric systems, such as for person i dentificati on and verification. Cross-spectral iris matching is defined as the matching between two iris images acquired in different electromagnetic spectra. One of the problems in cross-spectral iris matching is the modality gap between the images. Therefore, feature descriptors that are invariant to illumination and generate higher accuracy are required. This paper proposes an improved cross-spectral iris matching framework using Multi-Scale Weberface (MSW). In the proposed method, MSW is integrated with the Gabor Local Binary Pattern (GLBP), and it is abbreviated as MGLBP. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the previous method with higher accuracy. By using MGLBP, the recognition rate increases by 40% and 9% compared with the LBP and GLBP, respectively.","authors":["Maulisa Oktiana","Khairun Saddami","Fitri Arnia","Yuwaldi Away"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1109/ECAI.2018.8679097","Conference: 10th International Conference ofn Electronics, Computers, and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)At: Romania","Project: crossspectral image"],"references":["311453604_Unconstrained_Iris_Recognition","308889076_Cross-spectral_Iris_Recognition_for_Mobile_Applications_using_High-quality_Color_Images","290509735_50_Years_of_Biometric_Research_Accomplishments_Challenges_and_Opportunities","265741844_Enhancement_of_Iris_Recognition_System_Based_on_Phase_Only_Correlation","254020585_Gabor_Surface_Feature_for_face_recognition","216206388_Iris_Detection_and_Normalization","322877111_Periocular_recognition_in_cross-spectral_scenario","309814720_A_novel_framework_for_cross-spectral_iris_matching","309558779_On_Matching_Cross-Spectral_Periocular_Images_for_Accurate_Biometrics_Identification","309082436_Toward_More_Accurate_Iris_Recognition_Using_Cross-Spectral_Matching","304417919_Reference_Threshold_Calculation_for_Biometric_Authentication","283079855_Handbook_of_Iris_Recognition","282710793_On_cross_spectral_periocular_recognition","281777555_Advancing_Cross-Spectral_Iris_Recognition_Research_Using_Bi-Spectral_Imaging","278664237_Handbook_of_Iris_Recognition","243775699_Biometric_Personal_Identification_System_based_on_Iris_Analysis_U","228594200_Recognition_of_Human_Iris_Patterns_for_Biometric_Identification","224240937_Illumination_Normalization_Based_on_Weber's_Law_With_Application_to_Face_Recognition","222429241_Image_Understanding_for_Iris_Biometrics_A_Survey","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
