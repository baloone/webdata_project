{"id":"233254473_Grade_Expectations_Informed_or_Uninformed_Optimism_or_Both","abstract":"We investigated optimistic grade expectations among 258 college students from 2 contrasting perspectives: optimism as uninformed wishfulness and as an informed aspirational judgment. Results revealed considerable grade optimism; most students (70%) overestimated an average of 1 full grade. Grade expectations moderately predicted final grade but not course effort after adjusting for cumulative grade point average (GPA). Grade optimism and predictive accuracy differed as a function of GPA. For most students (upper two thirds on GPA), grade expectations accurately predicted performance, suggesting a mixture of self-knowledge and realistic aspirations, or informed optimism. For less accomplished students, grade optimism may be more uninformed wishfulness, the solution to which may be student skill improvement.","authors":["Soren Svanum","Silvia Bigatti"],"meta":["February 2006Teaching of Psychology 33(1):14-18","DOI:10.1207/s15328023top3301_4"],"references":["286999898_Grade_Point_Average_and_Changes_in_Great_Grade_Expectations","232558487_Exploring_the_Planning_Fallacy_Why_People_Underestimate_Their_Task_Completion_Times","232555590_A_simple_general_purpose_display_of_magnitude_of_experimental_effect","12688660_Unskilled_and_Unaware_of_It_How_Difficulties_in_Recognizing_One's_Own_Incompetence_Lead_to_Inflated_Self-Assessments","272168618_Unskilled_and_unaware_of_it_How_difficulties_in_recognizing_one's_own_incompetence_lead_to_inflated_self-assessments","270444960_Faculty_Forum","247504462_Effect_of_Class_Standing_on_Students'_Predictions_of_Their_Final_Exam_Scores","233356228_I_Know_I'll_Get_an_A_Confident_Overestimation_of_Final_Course_Grades","232471180_Abandoning_Unrealistic_Optimism_Performance_Estimates_and_the_Temporal_Proximity_of_Self-Relevant_Feedback","232462992_Healthy_personality_An_approach_from_the_viewpoint_of_humanistic_psychology","229131826_Situated_Optimism_Specific_Outcome_Expectancies_and_Self-Regulation","12268019_The_effects_of_grades_on_course_enjoyment_Did_you_get_the_grade_you_wanted","12020097_In_search_of_realistic_optimism_Meaning_knowledge_and_warm_fuzziness","11368310_Differences_between_students'_estimated_and_attained_grades_in_a_first-year_introductory_psychology_course_as_a_function_of_identity_development"]}
