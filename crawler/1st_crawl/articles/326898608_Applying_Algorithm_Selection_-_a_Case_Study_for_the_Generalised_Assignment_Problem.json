{"id":"326898608_Applying_Algorithm_Selection_-_a_Case_Study_for_the_Generalised_Assignment_Problem","abstract":"Many combinatorial optimisation problems are NP-Hard. Yet in practice high quality solutions are often obtained by (meta)heuristics. These work well in some cases, but not in others, indicating a potential for algorithm selection. In this extended abstract is discussed how to apply algorithm selection to a combinatorial optimisation problem and which challenges arise when doing so. The generalised assignment problem is used as case study.","authors":["Hans Degroote","Jose Luis Gonzalez-Velarde","Patrick De Causmaecker"],"meta":["August 2018Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 69:205-212","DOI:10.1016/j.endm.2018.07.027"],"references":[]}
