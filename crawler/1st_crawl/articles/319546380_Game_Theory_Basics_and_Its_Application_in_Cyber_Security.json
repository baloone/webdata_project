{"id":"319546380_Game_Theory_Basics_and_Its_Application_in_Cyber_Security","abstract":"The concept of game theory has in recent times has found application extensively in the area of security usually\ncalled security games. A game could be normal form or extensive form and are used to model the behaviour of players in a simple or complex contest for resources within a given scenario. Game theory finds application in various areas including finance, economics, politics, auction, sciences and cyber security. This work reviews the application of game theory in cyber security. A brief introduction to the concept of game theory is presented alongside a detailed review of research works carried out using the concept of game theory for cyber security.","authors":["Amadi Emmanuel Chukwudi","Udoka Felista Eze","Charles Ikerionwu"],"meta":["July 2017","Project: cyber security (DOS/DDOS) using game theory."],"references":["263605746_A_Game-Theoretical_Approach_to_Communication_Security","260843078_Game_Theory_Meets_Information_Security_Management","244455684_Challenges_in_Applying_Game_Theory_to_the_Domain_of_Information_Warfare","224123416_A_Survey_of_Game_Theory_as_Applied_to_Network_Security","220080748_Modelling_misbehaviour_in_ad_hoc_networks_a_game_theoretic_approach_for_intrusion_detection","312273520_Behavioural_Game_Theory","282829710_Multi-Agent_Distributed_Intrusion_Detection_System_Model_Based_on_BP_Neural_Network","277282404_Detecting_Network_Intrusions_via_Sampling_A_Game_Theoretic_Approach","7191091_Equilibrium_Points_in_N-Person_Games","4073964_A_Game_Theory_Based_Approach_for_Security_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
