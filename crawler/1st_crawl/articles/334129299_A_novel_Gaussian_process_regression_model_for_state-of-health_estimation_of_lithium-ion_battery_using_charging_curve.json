A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Gaussian process regression Charging curve Lithium-ion battery State-of-health A B S T R A C T The state-of-health (SOH) estimation is always a crucial issue for lithium-ion batteries. In order to provide an accurate and reliable SOH estimation, a novel Gaussian process regression (GPR) model based on charging curve is proposed in this paper. Different from other researches where SOH is commonly estimated by cycle life, in this work four specific parameters extracted from charging curves are used as inputs of the GPR model instead of cycle numbers. These parameters can reflect the battery aging phenomenon from different angles. The grey relational analysis method is applied to analyze the relational grade between selected features and SOH. On the other hand, some adjustments are made in the proposed GPR model. Covariance function design and the similarity measurement of input variables are modified so as to improve the SOH estimate accuracy and adapt to the case of multidimensional input. Several aging data from NASA data repository are used for demonstrating the estimation effect by the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method has high SOH estimation accuracy. Besides, a battery with dynamic discharging profile is used to verify the robustness and reliability of this method.","authors":["Duo Yang","Xu Zhang","Rui Pan","Yujie Wang"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Power Sources 384:387-395","Project: Theory and Method of Complex System Modeling, State Estimation and Management Control"],"references":["315116242_Gaussian_process_regression_for_forecasting_battery_state_of_health","304105608_Research_of_the_Relationship_between_Li-ion_Battery_Charge_Performance_and_SOH_based_on_MIGA-Gpr_Method","282476776_A_Review_of_SOH_Estimation_Methods_in_Lithium-ion_Batteries_for_Electric_Vehicle_Applications","266386006_Adaptation_of_an_Electrochemistry-based_Li-Ion_Battery_Model_to_Account_for_Deterioration_Observed_Under_Randomized_Use","226854057_Determination_of_optimum_parameters_for_multi-performance_characteristics_in_drilling_by_using_grey_relational_analysis","224342284_Prognostics_Methods_for_Battery_Health_Monitoring_Using_a_Bayesian_Framework","224314763_Uncertainty_Management_for_Diagnostics_and_Prognostics_of_Batteries_using_Bayesian_Techniques","220320873_Gaussian_Processes_for_Ordinal_Regression","312462717_Physically-based_reduced-order_capacity_loss_model_for_graphite_anodes_in_Li-ion_battery_cells","308760939_Adaptive_estimation_of_state_of_charge_and_capacity_with_online_identified_battery_model_for_vanadium_redox_flow_battery","308024242_An_on-line_estimation_of_battery_pack_parameters_and_state-of-charge_using_dual_filters_based_on_pack_model","305388629_A_novel_state_of_health_estimation_method_of_Li-ion_battery_using_group_method_of_data_handling","303806780_An_adaptive_sliding_mode_observer_for_lithium-ion_battery_state_of_charge_and_state_of_health_estimation_in_electric_vehicles","301829965_A_novel_health_indicator_for_on-line_lithium-ion_batteries_remaining_useful_life_prediction","301207383_An_online_method_for_lithium-ion_battery_remaining_useful_life_estimation_using_importance_sampling_and_neural_networks","298631216_Probability_based_remaining_capacity_estimation_using_data-driven_and_neural_network_model","286904164_State-of-health_estimation_of_LiFePO4graphite_batteries_based_on_a_model_using_differential_capacity","281086393_Residual_lifetime_prediction_for_lithium-ion_battery_based_on_functional_principal_component_analysis_and_Bayesian_approach","271636040_Behavior_and_State-of-Health_Monitoring_of_Li-ion_Batteries_Using_Impedance_Spectroscopy_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","268277891_A_method_for_joint_estimation_of_state-of-charge_and_available_energy_of_LiFePO4_batteries","264826666_Lithium-ion_battery_state_of_health_monitoring_and_remaining_useful_life_prediction_based_on_support_vector_regression-particle_filter","262148321_Method_for_estimating_capacity_and_predicting_remaining_useful_life_of_lithium-ion_battery","260305582_Particle-Filtering-Based_Prognosis_Framework_for_Energy_Storage_Devices_With_a_Statistical_Characterization_of_State-of-Health_Regeneration_Phenomena","260303872_Prognostics_of_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_Based_on_the_Verhulst_Model_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_and_Particle_Filter","259997018_A_naive_Bayes_model_for_robust_remaining_useful_life_prediction_of_lithium-ion_battery","257225561_Health_diagnosis_and_remaining_useful_life_prognostics_of_lithium-ion_batteries_using_data-driven_methods","257225349_Advanced_mathematical_methods_of_SOC_and_SOH_estimation_for_lithium-ion_batteries","257225141_On-board_state_of_health_monitoring_of_lithium-ion_batteries_using_incremental_capacity_analysis_with_support_vector_regression","256815928_Prognostics_for_state_of_health_estimation_of_lithium-ion_batteries_based_on_combination_Gaussian_process_functional_regression","232393325_A_multiscale_framework_with_extended_Kalman_filter_for_lithium-ion_battery_SOC_and_capacity_estimation","222554225_Gaussian_process_regression_for_multivariate_spectroscopic_regression","2320571_Gaussian_Processes_for_Regression"]}
