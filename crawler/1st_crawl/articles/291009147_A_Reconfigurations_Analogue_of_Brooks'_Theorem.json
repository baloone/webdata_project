{"id":"291009147_A_Reconfigurations_Analogue_of_Brooks'_Theorem","abstract":"Let G be a simple undirected graph on n vertices with maximum degree Δ. Brooks’ Theorem states that G has a Δ-colouring unless G is a complete graph, or a cycle with an odd number of vertices. To recolour\nG is to obtain a new proper colouring by changing the colour of one vertex. We show that from a k-colouring, k > Δ, a Δ-colouring of G can be obtained by a sequence of O(n\n2) recolourings using only the original k colours unless\nG is a complete graph or a cycle with an odd number of vertices, or\nk = Δ + 1, G is Δ-regular and, for each vertex v in G, no two neighbours of v are coloured alike.\nWe use this result to study the reconfiguration graph\nR\nk\n(G) of the k-colourings of G. The vertex set of R\nk\n(G) is the set of all possible k-colourings of G and two colourings are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. It is known that\nif k ≤ Δ(G), then R\nk\n(G) might not be connected and it is possible that its connected components have superpolynomial diameter,\nif k ≥ Δ(G) + 2, then R\nk\n(G) is connected and has diameter O(n\n2).\nWe complete this structural classification by settling the missing case:\nif k = Δ(G) + 1, then R\nk\n(G) consists of isolated vertices and at most one further component which has diameter O(n\n2).\nWe also describe completely the computational complexity classification of the problem of deciding whether two k-colourings of a graph G of maximum degree Δ belong to the same component of R\nk\n(G) by settling the case k = Δ(G) + 1. The problem is\nO(n\n2) time solvable for k = 3,\nPSPACE-complete for 4 ≤ k ≤ Δ(G),\nO(n) time solvable for k = Δ(G) + 1,\nO(1) time solvable for k ≥ Δ(G) + 2 (the answer is always yes).","authors":["Carl Feghali","Matthew Johnson","Daniël Paulusma"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44465-8_25","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["261101064_Colouring_Reconfiguration_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","260295061_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220194396_Connectedness_of_the_graph_of_vertex-colourings","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","267373223_Mixing_Graph_Colourings","261289085_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","250765908_New_proof_of_brooks'_theorem","235601904_Recoloring_bounded_treewidth_graphs","224836520_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220944627_On_the_Boolean_Connectivity_Problem_for_Horn_Relations","220908415_Approximability_of_the_Subset_Sum_Reconfiguration_Problem","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148404_Shortest_paths_between_shortest_paths","30526552_Mixing_3-colourings_in_bipartite_graphs_extended_abstract"]}
