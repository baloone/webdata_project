{"id":"270570029_Non-commutative_finite_monoids_of_a_given_order_n_4","abstract":"For a given integer \nn=p1α1p2α2⋯pkαk\n(k ≥ 2), we give here a class of finitely presented finite monoids of order n. Indeed the monoids Mon(π), where\nπ=〈a1,a2,…,ak|aipiαi=ai, (i=1,2,…,k),aiai+1=ai, (i=1,2,…,k−1)〉.\nAs a result of this study we are able to classify a wide family of the k-generated p-monoids (finite monoids of order a power of a prime p). An interesting di erence between the center of finite p-groups and the center of finite p-monoids has been achieved as well. All of these monoids are regular and non-commutative.","authors":["Bahram Ahmadi","Colin Campbell","Hossein Doostie"],"meta":["June 2014Analele Stiintifice ale Universitatii Ovidius Constanta, Seria Matematica 22(2):29-35","DOI:10.2478/auom-2014-0028"],"references":["232002363_On_semigroup_presentations","231965123_On_defining_groups_efficiently_without_using_inverses","226005343_Comparing_Semigroup_and_Monoid_Presentations_for_Finite_Monoids","225862242_Two_classes_of_finite_semigroups_and_monoids_involving_Lucas_numbers","267177065_Semigroup_Presentations_and_Number_Sequences","266346604_Presentations_of_groups_2nd_ed","265368806_Semigroup_and_Group_Presentations","259407018_On_Semigroups_Defined_by_Coxeter-Type_Presentations","256270368_Fibonacci_semigroups","243020193_On_Subsemigroups_of_Finitely_Presented_Semigroups"]}
