{"id":"283761902_An_algorithm_for_constrained_one-step_inversion_of_spectral_CT_data","abstract":"We develop a primal-dual algorithm that allows for one-step inversion of\nspectral CT transmission photon counts data to a basis map decomposition. The\nalgorithm allows for image constraints to be enforced on the basis maps during\nthe inversion. The derivation of the algorithm makes use of a local upper\nbounding quadratic approximation to generate descent steps for non-convex\nspectral CT data discrepancy terms, combined with a new convex-concave\noptimization algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated on\nsimulated spectral CT data. Simulations with noise and anthropomorphic phantoms\nshow examples of how to employ the constrained one-step algorithm for spectral\nCT data.","authors":["Rina Foygel Barber","Emil Y Sidky","Taly Schmidt","Xiaochuan Pan"],"meta":["November 2015Physics in Medicine and Biology 61(10)","DOI:10.1088/0031-9155/61/10/3784","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269935200_How_little_data_is_enough_Phase-diagram_analysis_of_sparsity-regularized_X-ray_CT","266319925_Joint_Reconstruction_of_Multi-channel_Spectral_CT_Data_via_Constrained_Total_Nuclear_Variation_Minimization","262111475_Proximal_ADMM_for_Multi-Channel_Image_Reconstruction_in_Spectral_X-ray_CT","260719931_Constrained_TpV_Minimization_for_Enhanced_Exploitation_of_Gradient_Sparsity_Application_to_CT_Image_Reconstruction","260709034_Quantifying_Admissible_Undersampling_for_Sparsity-Exploiting_Iterative_Image_Reconstruction_in_X-Ray_CT","317186201_Image-based_dual_energy_CT_using_optimized_precorrection_functions_A_practical_new_approach_of_material_decomposition_in_image_domain","283334576_MOCCA_Mirrored_ConvexConcave_Optimization_for_Nonconvex_Composite_Functions","281518371_Joint_estimation_of_tissue_types_and_linear_attenuation_coefficients_for_photon_counting_CT","262110719_Multi-Material_Decomposition_Using_Statistical_Image_Reconstruction_for_Spectral_CT","259250713_A_full-spectral_Bayesian_reconstruction_approach_based_on_the_material_decomposition_model_applied_in_dual-energy_computed_tomography"]}
