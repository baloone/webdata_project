{"id":"327397470_Arabic_Chatbots_A_Survey","abstract":"A Chatbot is a programmed entity that handles human-like conversations between an artificial agent and humans. This conversation has attracted the attention of researchers who are interested in the interaction between humans and machines to make the conversation more rational and hence pass the Turing test. The available research done in the field of Arabic chatbots is comparably scarce. This paper presents a review of the published Arabic chatbots studies to identify the gap of knowledge and to highlight the areas that needs more study and research. This study concluded the rarity of available research on Arabic chatbots and that all available works are retrieval based.
