{"id":"263729979_Unifying_and_extending_hybrid_tractable_classes_of_CSPs","abstract":"Finding a solution to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is known to be an NP-complete task. Many works have been concerned with identifying tractable classes of CSPs. Tractability is obtained by imposing specific problem structures, specific constraint relations or both. A tractable CSP class whose tractability is due to both structural and relational properties is said to be hybrid. In this article, we present a hybrid tractable CSP class that brings together and generalises many known hybrid tractable CSPs. The proposed class is characterised by means of simple but powerful notions from set theory.","authors":["Wady Naanaa"],"meta":["December 2013Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence 25(4)","DOI:10.1080/0952813X.2012.721138"],"references":["221605891_Consistency_and_Set_Intersection","220813650_Arc_Consistency_for_General_Constraint_Networks_Preliminary_Results","286195972_Constraint_Processing","268719155_Set_Intersection_and_Consistency_in_Constraint_Networks","223328889_Characterising_tractable_constraints","222561034_Generalizing_constraint_satisfaction_on_trees_Hybrid_tractability_and_variable_elimination","222472259_Tractable_constraints_on_ordered_domains","222466159_From_local_to_global_consistency","222452003_Network-Based_Heuristics_for_Constraint-Satisfaction_Problems","220546208_An_Optimal_k-Consistency_Algorithm"]}
