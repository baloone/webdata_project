{"id":"323058771_Aerial_Co-Manipulation_With_Cables_The_Role_of_Internal_Force_for_Equilibria_Stability_and_Passivity","abstract":"This paper considers the study of cooperative manipulation of a cable-suspended load with two generic aerial robots and without explicit communication. The role of the internal force for the asymptotic stability of the beam-position/beam-attitude equilibria is analyzed in depth. Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a non-zero internal force is chosen then asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam-pose configuration can be achieved with a decentralized and communication-less master-slave admittance controller. If, conversely, a zero internal force is chosen, as done in the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication. Non-zero internal force can be interpreted then as a fundamental factor that enables the use of cables as implicit communication means between the two vehicles in replacement of the explicit ones. Furthermore, the formal proof of the system output-strictly passivity with respect to an energy-like storage function and a certain input-output pair is given. This proves the stability and the robustness of the method even during motion. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.","authors":["Marco Tognon","Chiara Gabellieri","Lucia Pallottino","Antonio Franchi"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2018.2803811"],"references":["318693968_6D_physical_interaction_with_a_fully_actuated_aerial_robot","316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","311755244_Modeling_and_control_of_FAST-Hex_A_fully-actuated_by_synchronized-tilting_hexarotor","308669780_Force-Amplifying_N-robot_Transport_System_Force-ANTS_for_cooperative_planar_manipulation_without_communication","281777025_Aerial_Tool_Operation_System_using_Quadrotors_as_Rotating_Thrust_Generators","352532636_Cooperative_Grasping_and_Transport_Using_Multiple_Quadrotors","311754617_Cooperative_transportation_of_a_payload_using_quadrotors_A_reconfigurable_cable-driven_parallel_robot","308829363_Cooperative_impedance_control_for_multiple_UAVs_with_a_robotic_arm","308792527_Takeoff_and_Landing_on_Slopes_via_Inclined_Hovering_with_a_Tethered_Aerial_Robot","301836803_Dynamics_Control_and_Estimation_for_Aerial_Robots_Tethered_by_Cables_or_Bars"]}
