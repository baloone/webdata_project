{"id":"263526330_Google_Scholar_Metrics_for_Publications_The_software_and_content_features_of_a_new_open_access_bibliometric_service","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to review the software and content features of the Google Scholar Metrics (GSM) service launched in April 2012.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The paper reviews GSM, examining the software, browsing, searching and sorting functions, citation matching and content.\n\nFindings\n– The paper reveals that the service can offer a better alternative than the traditional Google Scholar service to discover and judge the standing of journals through the prism of their citedness. GSM could become a potentially useful complementary resource primarily by virtue of its brand recognition, and the convenience of not requiring the installation of additional software, but currently its bibliometric indicators are often inappropriate for decision making in matters of tenure, promotion, grants and accreditation.\n\nOriginality/value\n– The paper provides a good understanding of the GSM service.","authors":["Peter Jacso"],"meta":["August 2012Online Information Review
