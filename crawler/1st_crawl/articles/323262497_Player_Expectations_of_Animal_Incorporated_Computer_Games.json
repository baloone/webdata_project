{"id":"323262497_Player_Expectations_of_Animal_Incorporated_Computer_Games","abstract":"Animal incorporated games were both hypothesized and shown to serve multiple desired objectives, among which improvement of animal welfare, strengthening pet-owner relations, and creating new experiences for human players. We study the expected player experience of animal incorporated games through the use of an extended survey (n = 177). Our results indicate that respondents expect (a) added unpredictability caused by animal-opponent behavior, (b) increased enjoyment when playing against animals, for a limited duration of time, and (c) that hypothetical exact simulation of animal behavior offers equally interesting opponent behavior. Furthermore, concerns of animal welfare significantly moderate the preference for computer-, exact simulated- or animal-opponents. These outcomes can be used to correct for aspects such as novelty bias, when measuring player experiences in animal incorporated type games.","authors":["Wim van Eck","Maarten Lamers"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-73062-2_1","In book: Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment (pp.1-15)"],"references":["300725930_Trap_it","300253292_Interactive_Digital_Gameplay_Can_Lower_Stress_Hormone_Levels_in_Home_Alone_Dogs_-_A_Case_for_Animal_Welfare_Informatics","274384740_Biological_Content_Generation_Evolving_Game_Terrains_Through_Living_Organisms","268528951_Innocent_Fun_or_Microslavery","268512244_Felino_The_Philosophical_Practice_of_Making_an_Interspecies_Videogame","236821908_Metazoa_Ludens_Mixed_Reality_Interactions_and_Play_for_Small_Pets_and_Humans","311622248_Exploring_human_perceptions_of_dog-tablet_playful_interactions","286833854_Charting_unconquered_territories_Intelligent_systems_for_animalwelfare","271838690_Animal_Play_Behavior","242370299_Game_Design_Theory_and_Practice"]}
