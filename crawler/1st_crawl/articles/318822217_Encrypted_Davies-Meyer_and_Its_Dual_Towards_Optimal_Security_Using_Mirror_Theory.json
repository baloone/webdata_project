{"id":"318822217_Encrypted_Davies-Meyer_and_Its_Dual_Towards_Optimal_Security_Using_Mirror_Theory","abstract":"At CRYPTO 2016, Cogliati and Seurin introduced the Encrypted Davies-Meyer construction, \\(p_2(p_1(x) \\oplus x)\\) for two n-bit permutations \\(p_1,p_2\\), and proved security up to \\(2^{2n/3}\\). We present an improved security analysis up to \\(2^n/(67n)\\). Additionally, we introduce the dual of the Encrypted Davies-Meyer construction, \\(p_2(p_1(x)) \\oplus p_1(x)\\), and prove even tighter security for this construction: \\(2^n/67\\). We finally demonstrate that the analysis neatly generalizes to prove almost optimal security of the Encrypted Wegman-Carter with Davies-Meyer MAC construction. Central to our analysis is a modernization of Patarinâ€™s mirror theorem and an exposition of how it relates to fundamental cryptographic problems.","authors":["Bart Mennink","Samuel Neves"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-63697-9_19","Conference: Annual International Cryptology Conference"],"references":["317747434_Mirror_theory_and_cryptography","262363254_PRINCE_-_A_Low-Latency_Block_Cipher_for_Pervasive_Computing_Applications","253513440_Inequalities_on_the_Lambert_W_function_and_hyperpower_function","226759286_LBlock_A_Lightweight_Block_Cipher","225990394_KATAN_and_KTANTAN-a_family_of_small_and_efficient_hardware-oriented_block_ciphers","221622631_KLEIN_A_new_family_of_lightweight_block_ciphers","221291745_HIGHT_A_new_block_cipher_suitable_for_low-resource_device","221291660_PRESENT_an_ultra-lightweight_block_cipher","220618451_How_to_Construct_Pseudorandom_Permutations_from_Pseudorandom_Functions","220333452_A_Short_Proof_of_the_PRPPRF_Switching_Lemma","2914831_Building_PRFs_from_PRPs","2375849_A_Tool_for_Obtaining_Tighter_Security_Analyses_of_Pseudorandom_Function_Based_Constructions_With_Applications_to_PRP-PRF_conversion","315363312_Feistel_Ciphers","312833936_The_Indistinguishability_of_the_XOR_of_k_Permutations","309450684_On_the_Practical_In-Security_of_64-bit_Block_Ciphers_Collision_Attacks_on_HTTP_over_TLS_and_OpenVPN","308980849_The_Advantage_of_Truncated_Permutations","307822647_On_the_XOR_of_Multiple_Random_Permutations","305472629_The_SKINNY_Family_of_Block_Ciphers_and_Its_Low-Latency_Variant_MANTIS","305472574_EWCDM_An_Efficient_Beyond-Birthday_Secure_Nonce-Misuse_Resistant_MAC","305441541_Limits_on_the_provable_consequences_of_one-way_permutations","283470225_The_SIMON_and_SPECK_lightweight_block_ciphers","281328611_Mirrors_cubes_and_unbalanced_Feistel_schemes","267665553_Tight_Security_Bounds_for_Key-Alternating_Ciphers","267653281_Minimizing_the_Two-Round_Even-Mansour_Cipher","246104731_Etude_des_G'en'erateurs_de_Permutations_Bas'es_sur_le_Sch'ema_du_DES","234817896_A_Proof_of_Security_in_O2_n_for_the_Benes_Scheme","230483605_Distance_between_sampling_with_and_without_replacement","225913361_Luby-Rackoff_7_Rounds_Are_Enough_for_2n1-e_Security","225464274_Benes_and_Butterfly_Schemes_Revisited","225261394_mCrypton_-_A_Lightweight_Block_Cipher_for_Security_of_Low-Cost_RFID_Tags_and_Sensors","225177919_The_Sum_of_PRPs_Is_a_Secure_PRF","225144252_Luby-Rackoff_Backwards_Increasing_Security_by_Making_Block_Ciphers_Non-Invertible","221498286_A_Concrete_Security_Treatment_of_Symmetric_Encryption","221355142_XOR_MACs_New_Methods_for_Message_Authentication_Using_Finite_Pseudorandom_Functions","221355110_Security_of_Random_Feistel_Schemes_with_5_or_More_Rounds","221355080_The_Security_of_Cipher_Block_Chaining","221347851_The_Security_of_Triple_Encryption_and_a_Framework_for_Code-Based_Game-Playing_Proofs","221291758_Piccolo_An_Ultra-Lightweight_Blockcipher","221274785_The_Coefficients_H_Technique","220990610_A_Proof_of_Security_in_O2_n_for_the_Xor_of_Two_Random_Permutations","220833837_On_Linear_Systems_of_Equations_with_Distinct_Variables_and_Small_Block_Size","220833817_Benes_and_Butterfly_Schemes_Revisited","220336869_New_Blockcipher_Modes_of_Operation_with_Beyond_the_Birthday_Bound_Security","220335347_Security_of_balanced_and_unbalanced_Feistel_Schemes_with_Linear_Non_Equalities","220334214_Introduction_to_Mirror_Theory_Analysis_of_Systems_of_Linear_Equalities_and_Linear_Non_Equalities_for_Cryptography","2371448_How_to_Stretch_Random_Functions_The_Security_of_Protected_Counter_Sums"]}
