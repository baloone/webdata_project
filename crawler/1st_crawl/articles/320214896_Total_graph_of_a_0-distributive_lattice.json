{"id":"320214896_Total_graph_of_a_0-distributive_lattice","abstract":"Let £ be a 0-distributive lattice with the least element 0, the greatest element 1, and Z(£) its set of zero-divisors. In this paper, we introduce the total graph\nof £, denoted by T(G(£)). It is the graph with all elements of £ as vertices, and for\ndistinct x; y 2 £, the vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x _ y 2 Z(£). The\nbasic properties of the graph T(G(£)) and its subgraphs are studied. We investigate the\nproperties of the total graph of 0-distributive lattices as diameter, girth, clique number,\nradius, and the independence number.","authors":["Shahabaddin Ebrahimi Atani","Saboura Dolati Pish Hesari","Mehdi Khoramdel","Maryam Sedghi"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.29252/cgasa.9.1.15"],"references":["312252296_On_2-absorbing_filters_of_lattices","264311497_A_note_on_the_zero_divisor_graph_of_a_lattice","261949740_Total_graph_of_a_Commutative_semiring_with_respect_to_identity-summand_elements","258514502_General_Lattice_Theory","277281464_Lattice_Theory","276169042_Graph_Theory_With_Applications","268009417_Characterizations_of_the_0-distributive_lattice","266979691_Complement_of_the_zero_divisor_graph_of_a_lattice","265261422_On_Zero_Divisor_Graphs","256736521_The_Zero-Divisor_Graph_of_a_Commutative_Ring"]}
