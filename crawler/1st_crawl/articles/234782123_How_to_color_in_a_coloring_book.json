{"id":"234782123_How_to_color_in_a_coloring_book","abstract":"Children's coloring books contain line drawings which a child can fill in with a crayon to produce colored pictures. Two dimensional colored areas can be produced on a raster display by an analogous method. After drawing a closed curve with line drawing commands, the graphics system can fill the area bordered by the curve. This paper presents an algorithm for filling in areas of any size or shape. The area may be filled with any color, texture, or “wallpaper” pattern. The algorithm is simple, flexible and efficient, optimized to take advantage of the the memory organization of most current raster graphics systems.","authors":["Henry Lieberman"],"meta":["August 1978ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics 12(3):111-116","DOI:10.1145/965139.807380"],"references":["239584154_Maclisp_reference_manual","220252540_Raster_scan_approaches_to_computer_graphics"]}
