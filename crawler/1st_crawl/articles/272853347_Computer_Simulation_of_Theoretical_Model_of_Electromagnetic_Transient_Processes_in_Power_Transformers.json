{"id":"272853347_Computer_Simulation_of_Theoretical_Model_of_Electromagnetic_Transient_Processes_in_Power_Transformers","abstract":"The paper is presenting theoretical analytical model and computer simulation of electromagnetic transient process in a transformer. Transformer parameters in a selected transitional process have been analyzed. Theoretical model refers to an energetic transformer with concentrated parameters with consideration of parameters of mutual inductance M. Simulation was performed on a personal computer using the software program MATLAB SIMULINK. The computer simulation confirmed the possibility of transitional process analysis in transformerâ€™s windings with concentrated parameters.","authors":["Slobodan Bjelic","Zorica Bogicevic"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science 6(1):1-12","DOI:10.5815/ijitcs.2014.01.01"],"references":["295676290_Development_of_New_Measuring_Systems_Based_on_Symmetric_Components_in_Electric_Networks","265814459_Informatical_Model_of_the_System_of_Automatic_Breakdown_Control_in_Energetic_Systems","242936002_A_Physical_Arc_Model_for_the_Simulation_of_Current_Zero_Behavior_of_High_Voltage_Circuit_Breakers","36794515_Teorie_elektromagnetickeho_pole"]}
