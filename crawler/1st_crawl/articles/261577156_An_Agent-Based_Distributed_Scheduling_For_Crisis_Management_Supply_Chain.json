{"id":"261577156_An_Agent-Based_Distributed_Scheduling_For_Crisis_Management_Supply_Chain","abstract":"There has been a significant increase in the improvement of response to disasters in crisis management supply chain. Due to their sudden occurrence, these disasters require a consequent quick and efficient response that depends on the ability of logistics systems to generate plans under a variety of constraints. The supply chain studied in this work is a crisis management supply chain, composed of several elements such as transportation means, loading units, suppliers, equipment, resources, personsâ€¦ We propose an innovative method for solving a distributed delivery scheduling problem, based on a multi-agent system, for the delivery of goods (food, water, clothes, etc.) to the areas affected by the disaster. The covered areas are geographically distributed and partitioned into multiple sub-regions. Each area is assigned a delivery scheduling sub problem. By employing a distributed cooperative framework, we achieved an incorporation of various evaluation parameters in the process of scheduling in order to maintain a high level of synchronization of all the supply chain, and so to insure a better response to the crisis.","authors":["Ayda Kaddoussi","Nesrine Zoghlami","Slim Hammadi","Hayfa Zgaya"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 6(1):156-173","DOI:10.1080/18756891.2013.761774"],"references":["267188988_Scheduling_multiprocessor_tasks_on_two_parallel_processors","290438974_Estimator_Agent_approach_for_distributed_logistic_chain_optimization_Proceedings_of_the_50th_IEEE_International_Conference_ANIPLA","282063501_PAAN_Partial_Agreement_Negotiation_Network_based_on_Intelligent_Agents_in_Crisis_Situation","281328727_A_need_estimating_agent-based_tool_for_resources_forecasting","266008937_Generic_Need_Estimating_Agents_for_Resources_Forecasting","250475900_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithms_-_Principles_and_Examples","245281138_A_combined_terminal_location_and_ship_routing_problem","243765522_Les_Systemes_Multi-Agents-vers_une_intelligence_collective","241473492_Convergence_at_Prominent_Agents_A_Non-Flat_Synchronization_Model_of_Situated_Multi-Agents_Short_Paper","235709967_Flocks_Herds_and_Schools_A_Distributed_Behavioral_Model"]}
