{"id":"324948849_Parameter_identification_for_the_linear_wave_equation_with_Robin_boundary_condition","abstract":"We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the classical linear wave equation, where mixed boundary conditions of Dirichlet and Neumann/Robin type are enforced at the endpoints of a bounded interval. First, by a careful application of the method of characteristics, we derive a closed-form representation of the solution for an impulsive Dirichlet data at the left endpoint, and valid for either a Neumann or a Robin data at the right endpoint. Then we devise a reconstruction procedure for identifying both the interval length and the Robin parameter. We provide a corresponding stability result and verify numerically its performance moving from a finite element discretization.","authors":["Valeria Bacchelli","Dario Pierotti","Stefano Micheletti","Simona Perotto"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Inverse and Ill-Posed Problems 27(1)","DOI:10.1515/jiip-2017-0093","Project: Inverse problems"],"references":["314283191_A_multigrid_algorithm_for_the_p-version_of_the_Virtual_Element_Method","265074250_On_uniqueness_of_obstacles_and_boundary_conditions_from_restricted_dynamical_and_scattering_data","51918615_A_parabolic_inverse_problem_with_mixed_boundary_data_Stabilityestimates_for_the_unknown_boundary_and_impedance","329883192_Biomembrane_modeling_with_isogeometric_analysis","329078688_Multi-aspect_local_inference_for_functional_data_Analysis_of_ultrasound_tongue_profiles","323282107_Student_and_School_Performance_Across_Countries_a_Machine_Learning_Approach","323212361_Compositional_regression_with_functional_response","318011644_Reconstruction_of_space-dependent_potential_andor_damping_coefficients_in_the_wave_equation","301307530_Inverse_space-dependent_force_problems_for_the_wave_equation","277573070_Some_geometric_inverse_problems_for_the_linear_wave_equation","266436228_Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equations_and_wave_phenomena_Transl_from_the_Japanese_by_Bohdan_I_Kurpita","257832010_On_the_mixed_problem_for_the_wave_equation_with_the_third_and_first_boundary_conditions","245131094_Direct_time-domain_soil_profile_reconstruction_for_one-dimensional_semi-infinite_domains","244958359_A_Method_of_Computation_for_Structural_Dynamics","229650621_A_new_iterative_method_for_solving_the_coefficient_inverse_problem_of_the_wave_equation","216756303_The_Finite_Element_Method_Linear_Static_and_Dynamic_Finite_Element_Analysis"]}
