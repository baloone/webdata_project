{"id":"301720790_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_to_Make_Secure_Communication","abstract":"By the modernization of computer technology, the possibility of various cryptanalytic attacks increases rapidly, due to which maintaining the confidentiality on insecure channel becomes the burning problem and makes a large arena for the researchers. To tackle such problems and provide suitable solution, many methods have been introduced out of which automatic variable key (AVK) is the most dominated mechanisms as found in theoretical survey. In this paper, we have proposed a new scheme in AVK to generate the sequence of keys on the basis of divisibility factor of previous key. To prove the fruitfulness of our proposed scheme, we have compared our scheme with the existing related schemes based on randomness and standard deviation among the successive keys.","authors":["Bishal Kumar Singh","Subhasish Banerjee","Manash Pratim Dutta","Chandan Bhunia"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-81-322-2638-3_36","In book: Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Cognizance in Wireless Communication & Image Processing (pp.317-323)"],"references":["283571516_An_Approach_to_Generate_2-Dimensional_AVK_to_Enhance_Security_of_Shared_Information","260973216_Approach_towards_Optimum_Data_Transfer_with_Various_Automatic_Variable_Key_AVK_Techniques_to_Achieve_Perfect_Security_with_Analysis_and_Comparison","305801381_A_Novel_Approach_to_Achieve_the_Perfect_Security_through_AVK_over_Insecure_Communication_Channel","263578074_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_under_Various_Approaches_in_Cryptography_System","242101903_A_novel_approach_towards_realizing_optimum_data_transfer_and_Automatic_Variable_KeyAVK_in_cryptography","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","13815330_Information_technology_the_Internet_and_the_urologist"]}
