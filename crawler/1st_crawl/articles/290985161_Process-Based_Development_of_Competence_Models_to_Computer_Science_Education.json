{"id":"290985161_Process-Based_Development_of_Competence_Models_to_Computer_Science_Education","abstract":"A process model (cpm.4.CSE) is introduced that allows the development of competence models in computer science education related to curricular requirements. It includes eight subprocesses: (a) determine competence concept, (b) determine competence areas, (c) identify computer science concepts, (d) assign competence dimensions to computer science, (e) code competences, (f) formulate competences, (g) formulate learning tasks, and (h) formulate test tasks. The competence definition by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development gives the direction to cpm.4.CSE. This definition highlights four main dimensions of competence: knowledge, cognitive skills, practical skills, and attitudes. For the preparation of subprocesses and the exemplification of concepts, references have been used from the academic literature of computer science education. The processes, activities, and transformations of cpm.4.CSE are documented in Integration Definition for Function Modeling, a process modeling language that is standardized, widely used and easy to understand.","authors":["Andreas Zendler","Cornelia Seitz","Dieter Klaudt"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Educational Computing Research 54(4)","DOI:10.1177/0735633115622214"],"references":["234791862_MinimUML_A_minimalist_approach_to_UML_diagramming_for_early_computer_science_education","232495759_The_concept_of_competence_in_educational_contexts","226325476_The_IDEF_family_of_languages","224167940_Marrying_Content_and_Process_in_Computer_Science_Education","220843895_Infusing_Critical_Thinking_Skill_Classification_into_a_Software_Engineering_Course","220843777_Infusing_Critical_Thinking_Skill_Compare_and_Contrast_into_Content_of_Data_Structures_Course","220094606_Reducing_Abstraction_in_High_School_Computer_Science_Education_The_Case_of_Definition_Implementation_and_Use_of_Abstract_Data_Types","200534702_A_Study_of_the_Development_of_Studentsa_Visualizations_of_Program_State_during_an_Elementary_Object-Oriented_Programming_Course","33682262_Visual_Languages_for_Instructional_Design_an_Evaluation_of_E2ML","345476700_Grundlagen_kompetenzorientierten_Unterrichtens_Von_den_Bildungsstandards_zum_Schulcurriculum","319394497_Handbook_of_Logic_in_Computer_Science","316794514_Method_Model_and_Matter","293136216_Excellence_in_science_education_and_research","288926837_coUML_A_Visual_Language_for_Modeling_Cooperative_Environments","281345297_Assessment_of_Competencies_in_Educational_Contexts","281006727_Evaluating_Training_Programs_The_State_of_the_Art","271727985_Empirical_Determination_of_Competence_Areas_to_Computer_Science_Education","264912584_The_computer_science_and_engineering_handbook","246110036_Evaluating_training_programs_Inside_the_four_levels","245542990_Computer_science_curricula_2013_Strawman_draft","245104165_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_revision_of_Bloom''s_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objec","240249302_Software_Engineering_a_Practioner''s_approach","239757325_Competency_Models_A_Review_of_the_Literature_and_The_Role_of_the_Employment_and_Training_Administration_ETA","239487276_CRC_Handbook_of_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","235046527_Interservice_Procedures_for_Instructional_Systems_Development_Phase_3_Develop","234801715_Handbook_of_Visual_Languages_for_Instructional_Design_Theories_and_Practices","234636075_Instructional_Design_A_Plan_for_Unit_and_Course_Development","228645036_The_MOT_visual_language_for_knowledge-based_instructional_design","220807223_Assessing_CS1_java_skills_a_three-year_experience","220101657_Kompetenzorientierte_Aufgaben","220095356_Playfulness-based_design_in_educational_games_A_perspective_on_an_evolutionary_contest_game","220094544_Addressing_small_computers_in_the_first_OS_course","44460790_The_systematic_design_of_instruction_Walter_Dick_Lou_Carey","38138396_Vermittlung_von_Schlusselqualifikationen","37716320_National_standards_in_American_education_A_citizen's_guide","2918234_PL-Detective_A_System_for_Teaching_Programming","2839782_And_Computer_Science_Education"]}
