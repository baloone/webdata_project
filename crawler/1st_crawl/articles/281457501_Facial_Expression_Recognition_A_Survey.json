{"id":"281457501_Facial_Expression_Recognition_A_Survey","abstract":"Automatic facial expression recognition system has many applications including, but not limited to, human behavior understanding, detection of mental disorders, and synthetic human expressions. Two popular methods utilized mostly in the literature for the automatic FER systems are based on geometry and appearance. Even though there is lots of research using static images, the research is still going on for the development of new methods which would be quiet easy in computation and would have less memory usage as compared to previous methods. This paper presents a quick survey of facial expression recognition. A comparative study is also carried out using various feature extraction techniques on JAFFE dataset.","authors":["Jyoti Kumari","Reghunadhan Rajesh","Km.
