{"id":"316953311_Electronic_Government_Adoption_in_Pakistan_Supply_and_Demand_Perspectives","abstract":"The fundamental factor that creates barrier in the deployment of e-services in the government sector of Pakistan is a critic issue. These barriers are in both demand side as well as supply side of e-Government. As the technology is moving towards innovation, the governments all around the world are transforming their public administrations from conventional methods to new innovative methods. Electronic services are beneficial for citizens and government alike due to cost and time saving, simplification of the procedures, transparency in the governance processes and improvement of office management. Pakistan first took the initiative to incorporate e-Government services in the year 2002. The analysis of e-Government in Pakistan should be conducted through perspective of both parties. The supply-side perspective of the government is one side of the depiction that includes infrastructure, policies, employees behavior, skills etc. And, the demand-side depiction is the people's perspective regarding the deployment of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and users willingness. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model will provide the most preeminent insight in the demand side of e- Government in Pakistan. The government of Pakistan can incorporate the demand side factors side of e-Government services in developing countries like Pakistan.","authors":["Syed Zulfiqar Haider Zaidi","Chen Shuwen"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-9536-8.ch011","In book: Advances in Electronic Government, Digital Divide, and Regional Development (pp.208-227)"],"references":["267843964_Project_Management_Practices_in_e-Government_Projects_A_Case_Study_of_Electronic_Government_Directorate_EGD_in_Pakistan","267711021_User_Acceptance_of_the_E-Government_Services_in_Malaysia_Structural_Equation_Modelling_Approach","262643654_Factors_affecting_e-government_adoption_in_Pakistan_A_citizen's_perspective","260344620_Factors_influencing_the_adoption_of_e-government_services_in_Pakistan","249830959_Communities_of_Practice_A_Research_Paradigm_for_the_Mixed_Methods_Approach","235413072_Toward_a_Definition_of_Mixed_Methods_Research_Journal_of_Mixed_Methods_Research_1_112-133","235254120_E-government_adoption_Architecture_and_barriers","220580635_Modeling_Citizen_Satisfaction_with_Mandatory_Adoption_of_an_E-Government_Technology","303275694_Factors_infuencing_e-governmentadoption_in_Pakistan_Transforming_Government_People","287527192_Inhibiting_factors_for_E-Government_adoption_The_Pakistan_context","285730224_Factors_Affecting_the_Citizen's_Intention_to_Adopt_E-government_in_Saudi_Arabia","284256806_E-Government_Strategies_in_Developed_and_Developing_Countries","247517756_Digital_government_and_its_effectiveness_in_public_management_reform_A_local_government_perspective","232584262_Mixed_Methods_Research_Designs_in_Counseling_Psychology","229923307_Testing_the_Development_and_Diffusion_of_E-Government_and_E-Democracy_A_Global_Perspective","228217993_Designing_E-Government_Services_Key_Service_Attributes_and_Citizens'_Preference_Structures","227723255_E-Government_and_the_Transformation_of_Service_Delivery_and_Citizen_Attitudes","223369308_Using_ICTS_to_Create_a_Culture_of_Transparency_E-Government_and_Social_Media_as_Openness_and_Anti-Corruption_Tools_for_Societies","222936797_User-centered_E-Government_in_practice_A_comprehensive_model_for_measuring_user_satisfaction","222703541_E-government_evaluation_A_framework_and_case_study","222574441_E-Government_A_global_view_and_an_empirical_evaluation_of_some_attributes_of_citizens","220419757_Current_Practices_of_Leading_E-Government_Countries","220356712_The_Utilization_of_E-Government_Services_Citizen_Trust_Innovation_and_Acceptance_Factors","220082717_Identifying_critical_factors_for_adoption_of_e-government","46538866_The_demand_for_electricity_in_Pakistan"]}
