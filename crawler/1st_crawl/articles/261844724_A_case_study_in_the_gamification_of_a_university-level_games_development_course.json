{"id":"261844724_A_case_study_in_the_gamification_of_a_university-level_games_development_course","abstract":"Gamification is the application of game mechanics and player incentives to non-game environments. When designed correctly, gamification has been found to increase engagement and encourage targeted behaviours among users. This paper presents the gamification of a university course in Computer Games Development using an online learning management tool, including how this might generalize to other courses.\nOur goal with gamification was to improve lecture attendance, content understanding, problem solving skills and general engagement. The success of this intervention was measured using course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and a questionnaire; all with strongly positive results. However, this must be balanced against the costs, both monetary and time, required to successfully implement gamification.","authors":["Siobhan O'Donovan","James Gain","Patrick Marais"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1145/2513456.2513469","Conference: Proceedings of the South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists Conference"],"references":["274735854_Why_do_people_use_gamification_services","268742809_Activity-Based_Scenario_Design_Development_and_Assessment_in_Serious_Games","268632350_An_Empirical_Test_of_the_Theory_of_Gamified_Learning","268632276_Developing_a_Theory_of_Gamified_Learning","266398023_Gamification_in_Theory_and_Action_A_Survey","263918136_Eudaimonic_Design_or_Six_Invitations_to_Rethink_Gamification","262413983_Player_Types_A_Meta-synthesis","260432497_Demographic_differences_in_perceived_benefits_from_gamification","259841647_Defining_Gamification_-_A_Service_Marketing_Perspective","258697764_Gamification_in_Education_What_How_Why_Bother","256743509_Does_Gamification_Work_-_A_Literature_Review_of_Empirical_Studies_on_Gamification","247740395_Terminological_Ambiguity_Game_and_Simulation","247190693_Hearts_clubs_diamonds_spades_Players_who_suit_MUDs","237818750_Vygotsky's_Neglected_Legacy_Cultural-Historical_Activity_Theory","234400181_Gamification_in_logistics_and_supply_chain_education_Extending_active_learning","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","221518895_Gamification_Using_game_design_elements_in_non-gaming_contexts","11946306_Self-Determination_Theory_and_the_Facilitation_of_Intrinsic_Motivation_Social_Development_and_Well-Being","319993546_In_Defence_of_a_Magic_Circle_The_Social_Mental_and_Cultural_Boundaries_of_Play","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","285988308_Can_digital_natives_level-up_in_a_gamified_curriculum","281203435_The_reflex_arc_concept_in_psychology","275800295_Intrinsic_Motivation","274452501_Homo_Ludens_A_Study_of_the_Play-Element_in_Culture","273947278_Play_Between_Worlds_Exploring_Online_Game_Culture","267922967_Activity_Consciousness_Personality","264799686_Badges_in_Social_Media_A_Social_Psychological_Perspective","263114158_Expansive_Learning_at_Work_Toward_an_Activity_Theoretical_Reconceptualization","251841532_The_future_of_activity_theory_A_rough_draft","240285988_A_Ludicrous_Discipline_Ethnography_and_Game_Studies","235991149_Transforming_Homo_Economicus_into_Homo_Ludens_A_Field_Experiment_on_Gamification_in_a_Utilitarian_Peer-To-Peer_Trading_Service","223960244_Extrinsic_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_at_30_Unresolved_Scientific_Issues","220962627_A_behavior_model_for_persuasive_design","30873350_Context_and_Consciousness_Activity_Theory_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","6598675_Motivations_for_Play_in_Online_Games"]}
