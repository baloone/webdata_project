{"id":"271207614_DESIGN_AND_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RFID_BASED_INTELLIGENT_SECURITY_SYSTEM","abstract":"Radio frequency identification is one of the most\nexciting technologies that revolutionize the working\npractices by increasing efficiency. It is often presented as\nreplacement for barcode, but the technology has much\ngreater potential such as individual serial numbers for each\nitem and possibility to read these numbers at some distance.\nRFID is a technology being adopted in security field,\nbusiness fields and in the medical field. This work has the\nobjective to present a system for security based on RFID\ntechnology. The proposed system used contactless smart card\nto limit the entries of unwanted persons. Contactless smart\ncared has information stored in it which when come in the\nfield of RFID reader it immediately read the information\nstored in card. Reader recognize the information and\nmatch it with the information stored in it .If this reader has\nthe information about that card it will allow the card user to\nenter .If reader does not find information in tag in its\nmemory it will not.","authors":["Neeraj Kumar"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":[]}
