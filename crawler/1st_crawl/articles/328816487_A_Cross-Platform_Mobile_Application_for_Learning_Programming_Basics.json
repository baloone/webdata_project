{"id":"328816487_A_Cross-Platform_Mobile_Application_for_Learning_Programming_Basics","abstract":"p class=\"0abstract\">This paper presents and discusses a new mobile application for teaching and learning programming basics. The purpose is to help students acquire competencies while having fun and using their own devices. The mobile application was designed according to cross-platform approach to reach the broadest possible audience of learners, saving time and effort of development and maintenance. The code is fully shared between mobile platforms (iOS, Android and Windows Phone) allowing learners to install the application on any device. The core application is based on a multi-agent system to make the application interactive, flexible and dynamic and provide students with tailored instructions. A prototype is presented showing the main features of the application.</p","authors":["Alaeeddine Yassine","Mohammed Berrada","Ahmed Tahiri","Driss Chenouni"],"meta":["November 2018International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 12(7):139","DOI:10.3991/ijim.v12i7.9442"],"references":["317109067_Mobile_Applications_within_Education_An_Overview_of_Application_Paradigms_in_Specific_Categories","314229313_Design_and_Development_of_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_C_LanguageDesign_and_Development_of_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_C_Language","291423548_Mobile_Learning_as_a_Method_of_Ubiquitous_Learning_Students'_Attitudes_Readiness_and_Possible_Barriers_to_Implementation_in_Higher_Education","282816272_Comparison_of_Popular_Cross-Platform_Mobile_Application_Development_Tools","282483235_Understanding_students'_learning_practices_challenges_for_design_and_integration_of_mobile_technology_into_distance_education","318326820_Towards_the_Quality_Improvement_of_Cross-Platform_Mobile_Applications","303362871_Robot_ON_a_serious_game_for_improving_programming_comprehension","301951339_The_ProtegeVOWL_Plugin_Ontology_Visualization_for_Everyone","301217353_Employing_Mobile_Technology_to_Improve_Language_Skills_of_Young_Students_with_Language-Based_Disabilities","261464428_Real_Challenges_in_Mobile_App_Development"]}
