{"id":"288771736_Three-dimensional_simulation_of_flow_around_a_groyne_with_large-eddy_turbulence_model","abstract":"This article uses the Flow-3D software to provide a numerical model of groyne-surrounding flow by using the large-eddy turbulence model while studying the effects of these factors on separation length and width of separation region behind a groyne by applying various groyne lengths, installation angles and flow velocities. A comparison of results of the numerical model with the experimental results of other researchers indicates that increase in groyne length, the separation region is increased and between the installation angles of groyne, the maximum separation region length and width were related to installation angle on 105Â°. In addition, the results of the numerical model indicate that while the groyne length change, the ratio of separation region width to groyne length remains almost the same.","authors":["Mahdi Shahrokhi","Hamed Sarveram"],"meta":["July 2011Journal of Food Agriculture and Environment 9(3):677-681"],"references":["27334922_Three-Dimensional_Computation_of_Flow_around_Groyne","261854233_Numerical_simulation_of_two-dimensional_flow_near_a_spur-dike","245297243_Scale_Effects_in_Flume_Experiments_on_Flow_around_a_Spur_Dike_in_Flatbed_Channel","245295611_2-D_Depth-Averaged_Flow_Computation_near_Groyne","242439983_Flow_in_a_Centrifugal_Pump_With_Diffuser_Vanes-II_Addressing_Passage-Averaged_and_Large-Eddy_Simulation_Modeling_Issues_in_Turbomachinery_Flows","232408228_Experimental_and_Numerical_Investigations_on_Secondary_Flows_and_Sedimentations_Behind_a_Spur_Dike","231222263_A_Numerical_Study_of_Three-Dimensional_Turbulent_Channel_Flow_at_Large_Reynolds_Numbers"]}
