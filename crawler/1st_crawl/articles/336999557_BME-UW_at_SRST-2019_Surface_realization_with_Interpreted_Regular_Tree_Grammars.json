{"id":"336999557_BME-UW_at_SRST-2019_Surface_realization_with_Interpreted_Regular_Tree_Grammars","abstract":"The Surface Realization Shared Task involves mapping Universal Dependency graphs to\nraw text, i.e.~restoring word order and inflection from a graph of typed, directed dependencies\nbetween lemmas. Interpreted Regular Tree Grammars (IRTGs) encode the\ncorrespondence between generations in multiple algebras, and have previously\nbeen used for semantic parsing from raw text. Our system induces an IRTG for\nsimultaneously building pairs of surface forms and UD graphs in the SR'19 training data,\nthen prunes this grammar for each UD graph in the test data for\nefficient parsing and generation of the surface ordering of lemmas.\nFor the inflection step we use a standard sequence-to-sequence model with a biLSTM encoder and an LSTM decoder with attention. Both components of our system\nare available on GitHub under an MIT license.","authors":["Adam Kovacs","Evelin Ács","Judit Ács","Andras Kornai"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.18653/v1/D19-6304","Conference: Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Multilingual Surface Realisation (MSR 2019)","Project: Semantic parsing with Interpreted Regular Tree Grammars"],"references":["334117491_Underspecified_Universal_Dependency_Structures_as_Inputs_for_Multilingual_Surface_Realisation","334116316_The_First_Multilingual_Surface_Realisation_Shared_Task_SR'18_Overview_and_Evaluation_Results","332798339_Parsing_noun_phrases_with_Interpreted_Regular_Tree_Grammars","318742533_Alto_Rapid_Prototyping_for_Parsing_and_Translation","290989696_Graph_Structure_and_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic_A_Language-Theoretic_Approach","281458886_Competence_in_lexical_semantics","336995884_The_Second_Multilingual_Surface_Realisation_Shared_Task_SR'19_Overview_and_Evaluation_Results","334115767_AMR_dependency_parsing_with_a_typed_semantic_algebra","322587790_Integrated_sentence_generation_using_charts","306122983_Universal_Stanford_Dependencies_A_cross-linguistic_typology"]}
