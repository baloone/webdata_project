{"id":"220461959_Solving_the_Post_Enrolment_Course_Timetabling_Problem_by_Ant_Colony_Optimization","abstract":"In this work we present a new approach to tackle the problem of Post Enrolment Course Timetabling as specied for the International Timetabling Competition 2007 (ITC2007), competition track 2. The heuristic procedure is based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) where articial ants successively construct solutions based on pheromones (stig- mergy) and local information. The key feature of our algorithm is the use of two distinct but simplied pheromone matrices (representing event{ timeslot and event{room relations, respectively) in order to improve con- vergence but still provide enough exibility for eectively guiding the solution construction process. Furthermore a local improvement method is embedded. We applied our algorithm to instances used for the First and Second International Timetabling Competition (TTComp2002 and ITC2007). The results document that our approach is among the leading algorithms for this problem; in many cases the optimal solution could be found.","authors":["Clemens Nothegger","Alfred Mayer","Andreas M.
