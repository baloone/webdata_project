{"id":"258879641_Non-Equilibrium_Statistical_Mechanics","abstract":"As we all know, statistical mechanics deals with the behaviour of large assemblies of particles (or other kinds of entities, such as oscillators ...). In the present lectures we shall only consider systems governed by the laws of classical mechanics: however all the methods discussed here can easily be extended to the quantum mechanical case as well.","authors":["R.
