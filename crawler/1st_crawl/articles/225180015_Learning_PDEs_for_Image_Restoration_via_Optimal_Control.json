{"id":"225180015_Learning_PDEs_for_Image_Restoration_via_Optimal_Control","abstract":"Partial differential equations (PDEs) have been successfully applied to many computer vision and image processing problems.\nHowever, designing PDEs requires high mathematical skills and good insight into the problems. In this paper, we show that\nthe design of PDEs could be made easier by borrowing the learning strategy from machine learning. In our learning-based PDE (L-PDE) framework for image restoration, there are two terms in our PDE\nmodel: (i) a regularizer which encodes the prior knowledge of the image model and (ii) a linear combination of differential\ninvariants, which is data-driven and can effectively adapt to different problems and complex conditions. The L-PDE is learnt\nfrom some input/output pairs of training samples via an optimal control technique. The effectiveness of our L-PDE framework\nfor image restoration is demonstrated with two exemplary applications: image denoising and inpainting, where the PDEs are\nobtained easily and the produced results are comparable to or better than those of traditional PDEs, which were elaborately\ndesigned.","authors":["Risheng Liu","Zhouchen Lin","Wayne Zhang","Zhixun Su"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15549-9_9","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th European conference on Computer vision: Part I"],"references":["236268217_Image_Selective_Smoothing_and_Edge_Detection_by_Nonlinear_Diffusion_II","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","221364240_Fields_of_Experts_A_Framework_for_Learning_Image_Priors","220611570_Scale_and_the_differential_structure_of_images","220223243_Mathematical_Models_for_Local_Nontexture_Inpaintings","4301736_Variational_optimal_control_technique_for_the_tracking_of_deformable_objects","4301691_Dynamically_consistent_optical_flow_estimation","2758537_Discrete_Derivative_Approximations_with_Scale-Space_Properties_A_Basis_for_Low-Level_Feature_Extraction","301097308_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Parabolic_Partial_Differential_Equations","286784019_Ill-posed_problems","286632024_Scale_space_filtering","285641243_Image_Processing_and_Analysis_Variational_PDE_Wavelet_and_Stochastic_Methods","284801520_Introduction_to_numerical_analysis_Third_edition","275970953_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","269950118_Optimal_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Partial_Differential_Equations","268894999_Visualization_and_Processing_of_Tensor_Field","247446037_Scale-space_filtering_approach_to_fair_surface_design","243658322_Feature-Oriented_Image_Enhancement_Using_Shock_Filters","243655500_Image_selective_smoothing_and_edge_detection_by_nonlinear_di_usion","237128772_Solutions_of_ill-posed_problems_Metody_resheniia_nekorrektnykh_zadach","228852094_Designing_partial_differential_equations_for_image_processing_by_combining_differental_invariants","228804188_Learning_partial_differential_equations_for_computer_vision","226857211_Partial_differential_equations_and_finite-difference_methods_in_image_processing_part_1_Image_representation","221997061_Solution_of_Ill-Posed_Problems","220814553_Scale-Space_Filtering","220694041_Image_Processing_and_Analysis_Variational_PDE_Wavelet_and_Stochastic_Methods","220222733_Aspects_of_Total_Variation_Regularized_L_1_Function_Approximation","215618134_Optimal_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Partial_Different_Equations","215618120_Optimization_with_PDE_Constraints","200175449_Applications_of_Lie_groups_to_differential_equations_2nd_ed","44398329_Optimal_control_of_systems_governes_by_partial_differential_equations_Jacques_Louis_Lions","16718285_The_Structure_of_Images","9267280_Information_theory_in_electron_microscopy","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3191811_Scale-Space_And_Edge_Detection_Using_Anisotropic_Diffusion"]}
