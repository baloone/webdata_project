{"id":"254463009_Siren_An_interactive_tool_for_mining_and_visualizing_geospatial_redescriptions","abstract":"We present SIREN, an interactive tool for mining and visualizing geospatial redescriptions. Redescription mining is a powerful data analysis tool that aims at finding alternative descriptions of the same entities. For example, in biology, an important task is to identify the bioclimatic constraints that allow some species to survive, that is, to describe geographical regions in terms of both the fauna that inhabits them and their bioclimatic conditions.\nUsing SIREN, users can explore geospatial data of their interest by visualizing the redescriptions on a map, interactively edit, extend and filter them.\nTo demonstrate the use of the tool, we focus on climatic niche-finding over Europe, as an example task. Yet, SIREN is by no means limited to a particular dataset or application.","authors":["Esther Galbrun","Pauli Miettinen"],"meta":["August 2012","DOI:10.1145/2339530.2339776"],"references":["227733897_BIOMOD_-_A_platform_for_ensemble_forecasting_of_species_distributions","227549255_Predicting_the_impacts_of_climate_change_on_the_distribution_of_species_Are_bioclimate_envelope_models_useful","224839897_Very_high_resolution_interpolated_climate_surfaces_of_global_land_areas","221654447_Turning_CARTwheels_An_alternating_algorithm_for_mining_redescriptions","221605149_Redescription_Mining_Structure_Theory_and_Algorithms","220320802_Supervised_Descriptive_Rule_Discovery_A_Unifying_Survey_of_Contrast_Set_Emerging_Pattern_and_Subgroup_Mining","26539066_Interpretation_of_Models_of_Fundamental_Ecological_Niches_and_Species'_Distributional_Areas","1956867_Turning_CARTwheels_An_Alternating_Algorithm_for_Mining_Redescriptions","242323897_Redescription_Mining_Algorithms_and_Applications_in_Bioinformatics","220907312_From_Black_and_White_to_Full_Colour_Extending_Redescription_Mining_Outside_the_Boolean_World","220907182_Finding_Subgroups_having_Several_Descriptions_Algorithms_for_Redescription_Mining","220041585_Grinnell_J_The_niche-relationships_of_the_California_thrasher_Auk","216811675_Very_high_resolution_interpolated_climate_surfaces_for_global_land_areas","40158964_The_Atlas_of_European_Mammals"]}
