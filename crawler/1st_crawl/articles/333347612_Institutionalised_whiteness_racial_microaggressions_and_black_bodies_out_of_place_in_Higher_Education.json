{"id":"333347612_Institutionalised_whiteness_racial_microaggressions_and_black_bodies_out_of_place_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"On the morning of Friday 3 February 2017, Femi Nylander – a Black Oxford alumnus – walked through the grounds of Oxford University’s Harris Manchester College. Later that morning a CCTV image of Femi was circulated to staff and students who were urged to ‘maintain vigilance’.\nWhilst ‘post-racial’ ideology insists on framing such incidents as isolated aberrations bereft of wider structural and institutional context, in this article I draw upon the theoretical concepts of racial microaggressions and bodies out of place in order to disrupt this hegemonic interpretation.\nAdopting the Critical Race Theory (CRT) method of counter-narrative, I centralise the voices of student campaigns as sites of legitimate experiential knowledge. These campaigns reveal a web of whiteness that undergirds Higher Education. It is this web, I argue, that ensnares Femi on the day in question. Thus, Femi’s experience cannot be understood in abstraction from structural white supremacy and institutionalised whiteness.","authors":["Remi Joseph-Salisbury"],"meta":["May 2019Whiteness and Education 4(6):1-17","DOI:10.1080/23793406.2019.1620629"],"references":["329673627_Toward_a_Political_Philosophy_of_Human_Rights","322868358_Whiteliness_and_institutional_racism_hiding_behind_unconscious_bias","322013522_Why_we_still_need_to_talk_about_race","320964297_Heads_I_Win_Tails_You_Lose_Anti-Black_Racism_as_Fluid_Relentless_Individual_and_Systemic","312811524_Denying_the_Significance_of_Race","282696916_Racism_and_Education_Coincidence_or_Conspiracy","279676094_Toward_a_Critical_Race_Theory_of_Education","276292627_Exploring_Ethnic_Inequalities_in_Admission_to_Russell_Group_Universities","265032206_Critical_Race_Theory_Racial_Microaggressions_and_Campus_Racial_Climate_The_Experiences_of_African_American_College_Students","263120901_The_education_of_Black_males_in_a_'post-racial'_world","233153707_Just_What_is_Critical_Race_Theory_and_What's_It_Doing_in_a_Nice_Field_Like_Education","233014304_Talk_the_talk_walk_the_walk_Defining_Critical_Race_Theory_in_research","232890637_Unspoken_rules_of_engagement_Navigating_racial_microaggressions_in_the_academic_terrain","231756907_One_Year_Later_and_the_Myth_of_a_Post_Racial_Society","353425131_Understanding_Racism_within_the_Academy_The_Persistence_of_Racism_within_Higher_Education","344807140_Kant_and_Race_Redux","344601957_The_Erotic_Life_of_Racism","327360153_'Are_You_Supposed_to_Be_in_Here'_Racial_Microaggressions_and_Knowledge_Production_in_Higher_Education_Racism_Whiteness_and_Decolonising_the_Academy","326500637_Black_Mixed-Race_Men_Transatlanticity_Hybridity_and_'Post-Racial'_Resilience","323321605_White_Women_Race_Matters_The_Social_Construction_of_Whiteness","323321437_Uprooting_racism_how_white_people_can_work_for_racial_justice","323321142_Killing_rage_ending_racism","314052749_Race_in_Mind","311509060_Just_what_is_critical_race_theory_and_what's_it_doing_in_a_nice_field_like_education","309756144_Multiracial_college_students'_experiences_with_multiracial_microaggressions","304368026_Kant's_Racism","303042703_Stirring_the_ashes_Race_class_and_the_future_of_civil_rights_scholarship","301742075_Silence_is_violence_Critical_psychology_in_an_era_of_Rhodes_Must_Fall_and_Fees_Must_Fall","293072228_Getting_over_the_obama_hope_hangover_The_new_racism_in_'post-racial'_America","293071621_Color-blind_egalitarianism_as_the_new_racial_norm","290990085_On_the_nature_of_whiteness_and_the_ontology_of_race_Toward_a_dialectical_materialist_analysis","281453236_Racism_without_Racists_Color-Blind_Racism_and_the_Persistence_of_Racial_Inequality_in_the_USA","275280387_Critical_Race_Theory_in_Higher_Education_20_Years_of_Theoretical_and_Research_Innovations_Critical_Race_Theory_in_Higher_Education","274912515_The_Racial_Contract","273334066_Racial_microaggressions_as_a_tool_for_critical_race_research","267220128_KANT'S_UNTERMENSCHEN","263337816_The_story_of_schooling_Critical_race_theory_and_the_educational_racial_contract","263249991_Counter-narrative_as_method_Race_policy_and_research_for_teacher_education","262091012_A_Note_on_The_Weary_Blues","258151667_Educational_Inequities_and_Latinao_Undergraduate_Students_in_the_United_States_A_Critical_Race_Analysis_of_Their_Educational_Progress","249744544_A_phenomenology_of_whiteness","248970639_And_We_Are_Still_Not_Saved_Critical_Race_Theory_in_Education_Ten_Years_Later","246157581_Faces_at_the_Bottom_of_The_Well_The_Permanence_of_Racism","232595058_Stress_in_the_workplace","208573902_The_Color_of_Reason_The_Idea_of_Race_in_Kant's_Anthropology"]}
