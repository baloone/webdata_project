{"id":"324576525_Digital_innovation_A_review_and_synthesis","abstract":"Organizations are under increasing pressure to apply digital technologies to renew and transform their business models. A great deal of research has examined specific phenomena, such as adoption antecedents and design methods. However, it is unclear what we know in totality, including what research streams exist, how they fit together, and fruitful opportunities for new knowledge development. We combine scientometric and systematic literature review methodologies to examine 7 dimensions of an adapted theoretical framework: initiation; development; implementation; exploitation; the role of the external competitive environment; role of internal organizational environment; and product, service, and process outcomes. From a macro perspective, we find vastly uneven coverage of research streams, diversity and diffusiveness of research, and knowledge and learning as an underlying conceptual pillar. Combined with our summary of each of the 7 research streams, these findings suggest several areas of future research, which we develop by identifying oppositions and tensions.","authors":["Rajiv Kohli","Nigel Melville"],"meta":["January 2019Information Systems Journal 29(3)","DOI:10.1111/isj.12193"],"references":["346419785_Redesigning_Human_Systems","324286003_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","319394845_Sensemaking_in_Organizations","315362938_MOMENTUM_AND_SERENDIPITY_HOW_ACQUIRED_LEADERS_CREATE_VALUE_IN_THE_INTEGRATION_OF_TECHNOLOGY_FIRMS","314584828_Technology_and_OrganizationsOrganizations_and_Communication_Technology","313564201_Managerial_Fads_and_Fashions_The_Diffusion_and_Rejection_of_Innovations","313075408_Organizational_learning_and_communities-of-practice_Toward_a_unified_view_of_working_learning_and_innovation","312551435_Shaping_agility_through_digital_options_Reconceptualizing_the_role_of_information_technology_in_contemporary_firms","307534272_The_theory_of_affordances","304984122_Transfer_of_Knowledge_in_Knowledge_Management_Systems_Unexplored_Issues_and_Suggested_Studies","304837749_Implementation_as_mutual_adaptation_of_technology_and_organization","286831589_Making_innovation_happen_in_organizations_Individual_creativity_mechanisms_organizational_creativity_mechanisms_or_both","296555565_Innovation_in_turbulent_times","291768127_Vehicle_Telematics_at_an_Italian_Insurer_New_Auto_Insurance_Products_and_a_New_Industry_Ecosystem","288947775_Research_commentry_Desperately_seeking_the_IT_in_IT_research_-_A_call_to_theorizing_the_IT_artifact"]}
