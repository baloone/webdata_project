{"id":"283553522_A_projection-fixed_point_method_for_a_class_of_bilevel_variational_inequalities_with_split_fixed_point_constraints","abstract":"We propose a method for solving bilevel split variational inequalities involving strongly monotone operators in the leader problems and nonexpansive mappings in the follower ones. The proposed method is a combination between the projection method for variational inequality and the Krasnoselskiiâ€“Mann scheme for fixed points of nonexpansive mappings. Strong convergence of the iterative process is proved. Special cases are considered.","authors":["Tran Viet Anh","Le Dung Muu"],"meta":["October 2015Optimization","DOI:10.1080/02331934.2015.1101599"],"references":["257640369_Mann_type_iterative_methods_for_finding_a_common_solution_of_split_feasibility_and_fixed_point_problems","231860706_Iterative_Algorithms_for_Nonlinear_Operators","231065982_Iterative_methods_for_the_split_feasibility_problem_in_infinite-dimensional_Hilbert_spaces","231033803_Krasnoselski-Mann_iteration_for_hierarchical_fixed-point_problems","228913930_Unified_treatment_of_some_algorithms_in_signal_processing_and_image_construction","316800635_Combined_Relaxation_Methods_for_Variational_Inequalities","257312904_An_extragradient_method_for_split_feasibility_and_fixed_point_problems","241093936_Relaxed_extragradient_methods_for_finding_minimum-norm_solutions_of_the_split_feasibility_problem","231048942_The_split_common_fixed-point_problem_for_demicontractive_mappings","229058134_Convex_Optimization"]}
