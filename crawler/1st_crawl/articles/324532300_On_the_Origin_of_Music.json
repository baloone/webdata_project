{"id":"324532300_On_the_Origin_of_Music","abstract":"This paper investigates how evolution by means of selection is related to the origins of music. Discussing contemporary views on its origins, the paper argues for and against some of the conclusions drawn from other important research in the field. Stephen Pinker writes that music is ‘auditory cheesecake’ which exhibits no survival benefit to humans. This paper investigates this claim. Interviews were held with senior academics in the field of music to find a solid definition of what music is, as well as researching important texts on evolution, anthropology and psychology. The thesis also looks to see if there is a link between human biology and music and hypothesises a symbolic parallel between the way hearing develops in utero and the way music is written and performed. This theory is proposed here to be named ‘The Putto Theory’. This paper concludes the earliest music would have been drummed or clapped beats and that group singing aided bonding and defence; thus exhibiting a survival benefit. Music is more of an ‘auditory banquet’ which bonds homo-sapiens together as well as animating, satisfying and engaging human’s giant ‘grooming minds’ which have evolved from a need to live in groups for survival and reproduction.","authors":["Martyn Williams"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.18583.06564","Thesis for: Commercial Music PerformanceAdvisor: Professor Rob Toulson","Project: On the Origin of Music"],"references":[]}
