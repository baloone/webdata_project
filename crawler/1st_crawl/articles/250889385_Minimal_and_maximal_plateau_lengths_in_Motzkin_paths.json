{"id":"250889385_Minimal_and_maximal_plateau_lengths_in_Motzkin_paths","abstract":"International audience\nThe minimal length of a plateau (a sequence of horizontal steps, preceded by an up- and followed by a down-step) in a Motzkin path is known to be of interest in the study of secondary structures which in turn appear in mathematical biology. We will treat this and the related parameters maximal plateau length, horizontal segment and maximal horizontal segment as well as some similar parameters in unary-binary trees by a pure generating functions approachâ€•-Motzkin paths are derived from Dyck paths by a substitution process. Furthermore, we provide a pretty general analytic method to obtain means and limiting distributions for these parameters. It turns out that the maximal plateau and the maximal horizontal segment follow a Gumbel distribution.","authors":["Prodinger Helmut","Stephan Georg Wagner"],"meta":["January 2008Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS DMTCS Proceedings vol.
