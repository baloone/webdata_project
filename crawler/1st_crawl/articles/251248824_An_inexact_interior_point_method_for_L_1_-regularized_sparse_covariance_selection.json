{"id":"251248824_An_inexact_interior_point_method_for_L_1_-regularized_sparse_covariance_selection","abstract":"Sparse covariance selection problems can be formulated as log-determinant (log-det) semidefinite programming (SDP) problems\nwith large numbers of linear constraints. Standard primal–dual interior-point methods that are based on solving the Schur\ncomplement equation would encounter severe computational bottlenecks if they are applied to solve these SDPs. In this paper,\nwe consider a customized inexact primal–dual path-following interior-point algorithm for solving large scale log-det SDP problems\narising from sparse covariance selection problems. Our inexact algorithm solves the large and ill-conditioned linear system\nof equations in each iteration by a preconditioned iterative solver. By exploiting the structures in sparse covariance selection\nproblems, we are able to design highly effective preconditioners to efficiently solve the large and ill-conditioned linear\nsystems. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real covariance selection problems show that our algorithm is highly\nefficient and outperforms other existing algorithms.","authors":["Lu Li","Kim-Chuan Toh"],"meta":["December 2010Mathematical Programming Computation 2(3):291-315","DOI:10.1007/s12532-010-0020-6","Project: Interior-point methods for conic programming"],"references":["280018811_SDPT3_-_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming_version_13","262247171_Primal-Dual_Interior-Point_Methods_for_Self-Scaled_Cones","296716386_Gene-expression_profiles_in_hereditary_breast_cancer","284689114_Classification_of_cancer_Class_discovery_and_class_prediction_by_gene_expression_monitoring","275779674_Graphical_Models_in_Applied_Multivariate_Statistics","269923224_Covariance_Selection","269502505_Introduction_to_Graphical_Modeling","268999930_Introduction_to_Graphical_Modeling","268243951_Introduction_to_graphical_modelling_Incl_1_disk","258985790_Determinant_maximization_with_linear_matrix_inequality_constraints"]}
