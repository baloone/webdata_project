{"id":"329790469_Fault_Classification_of_Axial_and_Radial_Roller_Bearings_Using_Transfer_Learning_through_a_Pretrained_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"Detecting bearing faults is very important in preventing non-scheduled shutdowns, catastrophic failures, and production losses. Localized faults on bearings are normally detected based on characteristic frequencies associated with faults in time and frequency spectra. However, missing such characteristic frequency harmonics in a spectrum does not guarantee that a bearing is healthy, or noise might produce harmonics at characteristic frequencies in the healthy case. Further, some defects on roller bearings could not produce characteristic frequencies. To avoid misclassification, bearing defects can be detected via machine learning algorithms, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and sparse autoencoder-based SVM (SAE-SVM). Within this framework, three fault classifiers based on CNN, SVM, and SAE-SVM utilizing transfer learning are proposed. Transfer of knowledge is achieved by extracting features from a CNN pretrained on data from the imageNet database to classify faults in roller bearings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated based on vibration and acoustic emission signal datasets from roller bearings with artificial damage. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the fault classifiers are evaluated at different amounts of noise and training data.","authors":["Martin Hemmer","Huynh Van Khang","Kjell G.
