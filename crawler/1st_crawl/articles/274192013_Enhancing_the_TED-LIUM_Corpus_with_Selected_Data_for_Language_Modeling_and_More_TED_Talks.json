{"id":"274192013_Enhancing_the_TED-LIUM_Corpus_with_Selected_Data_for_Language_Modeling_and_More_TED_Talks","abstract":"In this paper, we present improvements made to the TED-LIUM corpus we released in 2012. These enhancements fall into two categories. First, we describe how we filtered publicly available monolingual data and used it to estimate well-suited language models (LMs), using open-source tools. Then, we describe the process of selection we applied to new acoustic data from TED talks, providing additions to our previously released corpus. Finally, we report some experiments we made around these improvements.","authors":["Anthony Rousseau","Paul Deléglise","Yannick Estève"],"meta":["May 2014","Conference: Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'14)"],"references":["274192197_LIUM's_systems_for_the_IWSLT_2011_Speech_Translation_Tasks","267936834_LIUM_SPKDIARIZATION_AN_OPEN_SOURCE_TOOLKIT_FOR_DIARIZATION","260986481_TED-LIUM_an_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_dedicated_corpus","260986388_XenC_An_Open-Source_Tool_for_Data_Selection_in_Natural_Language_Processing","260322173_LIUM's_systems_for_the_IWSLT_2011_Speech_Translation_Tasks","228828379_The_Kaldi_speech_recognition_toolkit","228567121_Overview_of_the_IWSLT_2010_evaluation_campaign","220733078_Boosted_MMI_for_model_and_feature-space_discriminative_training","220874673_Intelligent_Selection_of_Language_Model_Training_Data","220732472_Lattice-based_optimization_of_sequence_classification_criteria_for_neural-network_acoustic_modeling"]}
