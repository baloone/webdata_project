{"id":"311315523_More_Accurate_Question_Answering_on_Freebase","abstract":"Real-world factoid or list questions often have a simple structure, yet are hard to match to facts in a given knowledge base due to high representational and linguistic variability. For example, to answer \"who is the ceo of apple\" on Freebase requires a match to an abstract \"leadership\" entity with three relations \"role\", \"organization\" and \"person\", and two other entities \"apple inc\" and \"managing director\". Recent years have seen a surge of research activity on learning-based solutions for this method. We further advance the state of the art by adopting learning-to-rank methodology and by fully addressing the inherent entity recognition problem, which was neglected in recent works.\nWe evaluate our system, called Aqqu, on two standard benchmarks, Free917 and WebQuestions, improving the previous best result for each benchmark considerably. These two benchmarks exhibit quite different challenges, and many of the existing approaches were evaluated (and work well) only for one of them. We also consider efficiency aspects and take care that all questions can be answered interactively (that is, within a second).
