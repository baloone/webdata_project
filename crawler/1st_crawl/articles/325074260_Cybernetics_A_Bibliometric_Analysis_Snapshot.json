{"id":"325074260_Cybernetics_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_Snapshot","abstract":"Cybernetics is many different things to many different people and thus it has been used within various scientific disciplines. The aim of the presented paper was to produce a snapshot of cybernetics information source production using bibliometric analysis. The results showed that the production of information sources has been increasing, with a significant but temporary decrease in 90 s. The distribution in the more prolific countries and institutions is similar to other scientific fields, with the exception of China, which is higher ranked than usual. Important cybernetic papers are published in high-ranking journals. The more frequent topics covered are engineering and computer sciences. Cybernetic research in 2013 was mostly funded by Australasian, U.S., and European funding agencies.","authors":["Peter Kokol"],"meta":["February 2018Cybernetics and Systems 49(2):95-102","DOI:10.1080/01969722.2017.1418789"],"references":["261848154_Ethics_and_Second-Order_Cybernetics","26387625_Bibliometrics_of_electronic_journals_in_information_science","23353944_Cybernetics","7380639_The_History_and_Meaning_of_the_Journal_Impact_Factor"]}
