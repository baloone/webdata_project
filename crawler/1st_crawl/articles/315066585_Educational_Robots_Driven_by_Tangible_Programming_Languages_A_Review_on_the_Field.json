{"id":"315066585_Educational_Robots_Driven_by_Tangible_Programming_Languages_A_Review_on_the_Field","abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on tangible programming languages which are designed to program real robots and robotic mechanisms. Tangible programming interfaces appear to be more accessible to novice programmers and possibly reduce the age threshold for participation, making this way robot programming an educational toy even for preschool and elementary students. Moreover, this paper makes a short examination on the resent research findings on the field of tangible robot programming and argues that the combination of tangible programming and robot construction may offer unique opportunities for educational robotics.","authors":["T.
