Analyze the need to develop project-based learning models and cooperative-based learning. The research method used was a survey method. Data were collected using questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The research sample was Bachelor of Information Systems Study Program students and lecturers at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Putra Indonesia YPTK Padang. The results of this study obtained the level of mastery of pedagogical competencies of current students and the types of learning styles of each student that describe the characteristics of their learning styles. Then, the model used in the development of learning planning is a learning model that can learn students according to student learning styles to create student activity in learning, critical thinking, creative, communicative, and collaborative by the demands of 21st-century learning equipped with quality model books and lecturer manuals that are expected to be able to improve student competencies in accordance with the learning outcomes to be achieved.","authors":["Febriyanno Suryana","Nizwardi Jalinus","Rusnardi Rahmat","Raimon Efendi"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.22440.80646","Project: Cooperative Project Based Learning Models in Programming  Languages: A Proposed"],"references":["326195259_Students'_learning_performance_and_perceived_motivation_in_gamified_flipped-class_instruction","320133307_The_authentic_assessment_to_measure_students'_English_productive_skills_based_on_2013_Curriculum","273501112_Computer_Usage_The_Impact_of_Computer_Anxiety_and_Computer_Self-efficacy","273425794_Enhancing_21st_Century_Learning_Skills_Via_Digital_Storytelling_Voices_of_Malaysian_Teachers_and_Undergraduates","355684917_Developing_of_Entrepreneur_Digitals_Learning_Model_in_the_Industrial_Revolution_40_to_Improve_21st_Century_skills","339308311_Pengembangan_E-Authentic_Asessment_Berbasis_PBL_untuk_Meningkatkan_Kompetensi_Mahasiswa_dalam_Pembelajaran_Jaringan_Komputer","334159110_Determinants_of_21st-century_digital_skills_A_large-scale_survey_among_working_professionals","331595696_Effectiveness_of_Collaborative_Problem_Based_Learning_Model_of_Learning_Computer_Network_Courses","314217019_The_relation_between_21st-century_skills_and_digital_skills_A_systematic_literature_review","306145838_Project-Based_Learning_and_Pedagogy_in_Teacher_Preparation_Staking_Out_the_Theoretical_Mid-Ground"]}
