{"id":"248421226_What_is_Commitment_Physical_Organizational_and_Social","abstract":"This paper uses Participatory Semantics to explicate commitments. Information expresses the fact that a system is in a certain configuration that is correlated to the configuration of another system. Any physical system may contain information about another physical system For the purposes of this paper, physical commitment is defined to be infor- mation about physical systems (situated at a particular place and time). This use of the term physical commitment is currently nonstandard Note that commitment is defined for whole physical system ; not just a par- ticipant or process. Fidelity of commitment is defined to be the strength of the relationship between information and physical system. Organizational and social commitments can be analyzed in terms of physical commitments. For example systems that behave as scientific communities can have commitments for monotonicity , concurrency , commutativity , pluralism, skepticism, and provenance. Actors rise to the level of \" Agenthood \" when they competently use expres- sions of commitments expressing intention, dedication, judgment, decision, proposal, plan, contract, purpose, belief, policy, method, procedure, practice, backing, questioning, etc. Speech Act Theory has attempted to formalize the semantics of some kinds of expressions for commitments. Participatory Semantics for commitment can overcome some of the lack of expressiveness and generality in Speech Act The- ory.","authors":["Carl Hewitt"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
