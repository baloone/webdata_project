{"id":"327308456_Perceptual_image_hashing_based_on_a_deep_convolution_neural_network_for_content_authentication","abstract":"Image hash functions have wide-ranging application in many fields. This study presents a perceptual image-hashing scheme for a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for the purpose of content authentication. First, an AlexNet model of DCNN is constructed and trained to assess the performance of a given network. Then, the trained network is used to extract an image feature matrix. Finally, an image-hashing series is generated for content authentication. Experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the proposed method has a higher discrimination capability and an acceptable robustness against content-preserving operations, such as random attacks, rotation, JPEG compression, and additive Gaussian noise. A receiver operating characteristics curve is employed and demonstrates that the proposed image hashing obtains a desirable compromise between discrimination and robustness.","authors":["Cuiling Jiang"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Electronic Imaging 27(04):1","DOI:10.1117/1.JEI.27.4.043055"],"references":[]}
