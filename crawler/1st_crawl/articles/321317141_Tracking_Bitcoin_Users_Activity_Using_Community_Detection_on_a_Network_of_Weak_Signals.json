{"id":"321317141_Tracking_Bitcoin_Users_Activity_Using_Community_Detection_on_a_Network_of_Weak_Signals","abstract":"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency attracting a lot of interest both from the general public and researchers. There is an ongoing debate on the question of usersâ€™ anonymity: while the Bitcoin protocol has been designed to ensure that the activity of individual users could not be tracked, some methods have been proposed to partially bypass this limitation. In this article, we show how the Bitcoin transaction network can be studied using complex networks analysis techniques, and in particular how community detection can be efficiently used to re-identify multiple addresses belonging to a same user.","authors":["Remy Cazabet","Baccour Rym","Matthieu Latapy"],"meta":["November 2018Studies in Computational Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-72150-7_14","Conference: International Workshop on Complex Networks and their Applications"],"references":["321993697_Dynamic_Community_Detection","318165883_Dynamic_Community_Detection","312829899_The_Bitcoin_Backbone_Protocol_Analysis_and_Applications","305401130_A_Fistful_of_Bitcoins_Characterizing_Payments_among_Men_with_No_Names","303409428_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Address_Clustering","296700474_Analyzing_the_Bitcoin_Network_The_First_Four_Years","290737633_BitIodine_Extracting_Intelligence_from_the_Bitcoin_Network","312484810_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Address_Clustering","306304642_Hawk_The_Blockchain_Model_of_Cryptography_and_Privacy-Preserving_Smart_Contracts","278691936_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
