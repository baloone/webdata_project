{"id":"342621177_Application_of_escape_lab-room_to_heat_transfer_evaluation_for_Chemical_Engineers","abstract":"Heat transfer is an elementary discipline across to many engineering degrees. As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student’s motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject [1]. In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students [2]. In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students.\nThe plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10% of the total course score.","authors":["Daniel de la Flor","Jose A.
