{"id":"326194947_A_Deontic_Logic_Reasoning_Infrastructure","abstract":"A flexible infrastructure for the automation of deontic and normative reasoning is presented. Our motivation is the development, study and provision of legal and moral reasoning competencies in future intelligent machines. Since there is no consensus on the “best” deontic logic formalisms and since the answer may be application specific, a flexible infrastructure is proposed in which candidate logic formalisms can be varied, assessed and compared in experimental ethics application studies. Our work thus links the historically rich research areas of classical higher-order logic, deontic logics, normative reasoning and formal ethics.","authors":["Christoph Benzmüller","Xavier Parent","Leon van der Torre"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94418-0_6","In book: Sailing Routes in the World of Computation (pp.60-69)","Projects: Normative Reasoning and Machine EthicsStudies in Computational Metaphysics"],"references":["324387784_First_Experiments_with_a_Flexible_Infrastructure_for_Normative_Reasoning","324055533_IO_Logic_in_HOL_---_First_Steps","323392435_Faithful_Semantical_Embedding_of_a_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","321160582_Mechanizing_Principia_Logico-Metaphysica_in_Functional_Type_Theory","320994052_Recent_Successes_with_a_Meta-Logical_Approach_to_Universal_Logical_Reasoning_Extended_Abstract","317425406_Responsible_Autonomy","313943927_Computer-Assisted_Analysis_of_the_Anderson-Hajek_Ontological_Controversy","301295955_The_Inconsistency_in_Godel's_Ontological_Argument_A_Success_Story_for_AI_in_Metaphysics","321982482_The_pragmatic_oddity_in_norm-based_deontic_logics","318830177_Responsible_Autonomy"]}
