{"id":"290481462_Nitric_Oxide_as_a_Switching_Mechanism_Between_Axon_Degeneration_and_Regrowth_During_Developmental_Remodeling","abstract":"During development, neurons switch among growth states, such as initial axon outgrowth, axon pruning, and regrowth. By studying the stereotypic remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), we found that the heme-binding nuclear receptor E75 is dispensable for initial axon outgrowth of MB Î³ neurons but is required for their developmental regrowth. Genetic experiments and pharmacological manipulations on ex-vivo-cultured brains indicate that neuronally generated nitric oxide (NO) promotes pruning but inhibits regrowth. We found that high NO levels inhibit the physical interaction between the E75 and UNF nuclear receptors, likely accounting for its repression of regrowth. Additionally, NO synthase (NOS) activity is downregulated at the onset of regrowth, at least partially, by short inhibitory NOS isoforms encoded within the NOS locus, indicating how NO production could be developmentally regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that NO signaling provides a switching mechanism between the degenerative and regenerative states of neuronal remodeling.","authors":["Dana Rabinovich","Shiri P Yaniv","Idan Alyagor","Oren Schuldiner"],"meta":["January 2016Cell 164(1-2):170-182","DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.047"],"references":["281372637_Long_term_ex_vivo_culturing_of_Drosophila_brain_as_a_method_to_live_image_pupal_brains_Insights_into_the_cellular_mechanisms_of_neuronal_remodeling","277144108_Transcriptional_Regulation_via_Nuclear_Receptor_Crosstalk_Required_for_the_Drosophila_Circadian_Clock","275360335_Hippocampal_Pruning_as_a_New_Theory_of_Schizophrenia_Etiopathogenesis","274642780_The_over-pruning_hypothesis_of_autism","259920189_Astrocytes_Play_a_Key_Role_in_Drosophila_Mushroom_Body_Axon_Pruning","257815269_Nitric_oxide_mediates_local_activity-dependent_excitatory_synapse_development","236087532_Nitric_Oxide_Synthesis_and_cGMP_Production_Is_Important_for_Neurite_Growth_and_Synapse_Remodeling_after_Axotomy","232246270_A_GAL4-Driver_Line_Resource_for_Drosophila_Neurobiology","230743204_Axon_Regrowth_during_Development_and_Regeneration_Following_Injury_Share_Molecular_Mechanisms","51454137_Nitric_oxide_coordinates_metabolism_growth_and_development_via_the_nuclear_receptor_E75","51138577_Dendritic_Spines_and_Development_Towards_a_Unifying_Model_of_Spinogenesis-A_Present_Day_Review_of_Cajal's_Histological_Slides_and_Drawings","51117195_Neuronal_Nitric_Oxide_Contributes_to_Neuroplasticity-Associated_Protein_Expression_through_cGMP_Protein_Kinase_G_and_Extracellular_Signal-Regulated_Kinase","50400145_Nuclear_Receptor_Rev-erb_Alpha_Nr1d1_Functions_in_Concert_with_Nr2e3_to_Regulate_Transcriptional_Networks_in_the_Retina","49713502_NO_Orchestrates_the_Loss_of_Synaptic_Boutons_from_Adult_Sick_Motoneurons_Modeling_a_Molecular_Mechanism","41547832_Nitric_oxide_synthase_is_not_essential_for_Drosophila_development","21466823_Bredt_DS_Snyder_SHIsolation_of_nitric_oxide_synthase_a_calmodulin-requiring_enzyme_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_U_S_A_87_682-685","11820040_The_Drosophila_Nitric-oxide_Synthase_Gene_dNOS_Encodes_a_Family_of_Proteins_That_Can_Modulate_NOS_Activity_by_Acting_as_Dominant_Negative_Regulators","8517331_Photoreceptor-specific_nuclear_receptor_NR2E3_functions_as_a_transcriptional_activator_in_rod_photoreceptors","7874633_Drosophila_soluble_guanylyl_cyclase_mutants_exhibit_increased_foraging_locomotion_Behavioral_and_genomic_investigations","7721343_Luo_L_O'Leary_D_D_M_Axon_retraction_and_degeneration_in_development_and_disease_Annu_Rev_Neurosci_28_127-156","5944907_Reductase_Domain_of_Drosophila_melanogaster_Nitric-Oxide_Synthase_Redox_Transformations_Regulation_and_Similarity_to_Mammalian_Homologues","5809624_Identification_of_heme_as_the_ligand_for_the_orphan_nuclear_receptors_REV-ERB_and_REV-ERBb","282764575_Sculpting_Neural_Circuits_by_Axon_and_Dendrite_Pruning","282709367_Isolation_of_nitric_oxide_synthetase_a_calmodulin-requiring_enzyme","265609849_Mechanisms_of_developmental_neurite_pruning","262812087_Nuclear_receptors_and_Drosophila_neuronal_remodeling","262052245_Axon_and_Dendrite_Pruning_in_Drosophila","262016605_Axon_and_dendrite_pruning_in_Drosophila","260114263_Genome-wide_identification_of_Drosophila_Hb9_targets_reveals_a_pivotal_role_in_directing_the_transcriptome_within_eight_neuronal_lineages_including_activation_of_Nitric_Oxide_Synthase_and_Fd59aFox-D","236977001_Compartmentalized_Calcium_Transients_Trigger_Dendrite_Pruning_in_Drosophila_Sensory_Neurons","235786154_Target-_and_Mechanism-Based_Therapeutics_for_Neurodegenerative_Diseases_Strength_in_Numbers","51701514_Ecdysone-_and_NO-Mediated_Gene_Regulation_by_Competing_EcRUsp_and_E75A_Nuclear_Receptors_during_Drosophila_Development","24212751_Neuronal_nitric_oxide_synthase_Structure_subcellular_localization_regulation_and_clinical_implications","23667018_DHR51_the_Drosophila_melanogaster_Homologue_of_the_Human_Photoreceptor_Cell-Specific_Nuclear_Receptor_Is_a_Thiolate_Heme-Binding_Protein","13099744_Mosaic_Analysis_with_a_Repressible_Cell_Marker_for_Studies_of_Gene_Function_in_Neuronal_Morphogenesis","12781111_RNA_diversity_has_profound_effects_on_the_translation_of_neuronal_nitric_oxide_synthase","11378803_Differences_in_peripheral_nerve_degenerationregeneration_between_wild-type_and_neuronal_nitric_oxide_synthase_knockout_mice","8454024_Regulation_of_multimers_via_truncated_isoforms_A_novel_mechanism_to_control_nitric-oxide_signaling","8219561_Essential_function_of_nitric_oxide_synthase_in_Drosophila","7694894_The_Drosophila_Nuclear_Receptor_E75_Contains_Heme_and_Is_Gas_Responsive","7011748_Essential_Role_of_the_Apoptotic_Cell_Engulfment_Genes_draper_and_ced-6_in_Programmed_Axon_Pruning_during_Drosophila_Metamorphosis"]}
