{"id":"220089417_Priority_Algorithms_for_the_Subset-Sum_Problem","abstract":"Greedy algorithms are simple, but their relative power is not well understood. The priority framework (6) captures a key notion of \"greediness\" in the sense that it processes (in some locally optimal manner) one data item at a time, depending on and only on the current knowledge of the input. This algorithmic model provides a tool to assess the computational power and limitations of greedy algorithms, especially in terms of their approximability. In this paper, we study priority algo- rithm approximation ratios for the Subset-Sum Problem, focusing on the power of revocable decisions, for which the accepted data items can be later rejected to maintain the feasibility of the solution. We first provide a tight bound of � ≈ 0.657 for irrevocable priority algorithms. We then show that the approximation ratio of fixed order revocable priority al- gorithms is between � ≈ 0.780 and ≈ 0.852, and the ratio of adaptive order revocable priority algorithms is between 0.8 and � ≈ 0.893.","authors":["Yuli Ye","Allan Borodin"],"meta":["October 2008Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 16(3):198-228","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-73545-8_49","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th annual international conference on Computing and Combinatorics"],"references":["227295198_A_Note_on_Scheduling_Equal-Length_Jobs_to_Maximize_Throughput","226342780_Models_of_Greedy_Algorithms_for_Graph_Problems","274349843_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","246612829_Knapsack_Problems_algorithms_and_computer_implementation_John_Wiley_Sons_Ltd","245588048_Bounds_for_Certain_Multiprocessor_Timing_Anomalies","242923610_On-line_scheduling_revisited","242552401_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","228732503_Polynomial_time_algorithms_for_minimizing_the_weighted_number_of_late_jobs_on_a_single_machine_with_equal_processing_times","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227443278_An_N_Job_One_Machine_Sequencing_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_the_Number_of_Late_Jobs"]}
