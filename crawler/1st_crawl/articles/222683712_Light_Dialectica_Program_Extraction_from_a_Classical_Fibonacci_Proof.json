{"id":"222683712_Light_Dialectica_Program_Extraction_from_a_Classical_Fibonacci_Proof","abstract":"We demonstrate program extraction by the Light Dialectica Interpretation (LDI) on a minimal logic proof of the classical existence of Fibonacci numbers. This semi-classical proof is available in MinLog's library of examples. The term of Gödel's T extracted by the LDI is, after strong normalization, exactly the usual recursive algorithm which defines the Fibonacci numbers (in pairs). This outcome of the Light Dialectica meta-algorithm is much better than the T-program extracted by means of the pure Gödel Dialectica Interpretation. It is also strictly less complex than the result obtained by means of the refined A-translation technique of Berger, Buchholz and Schwichtenberg on an artificially distorted variant of the input proof, but otherwise it is identical with the term yielded by Berger's Kripke-style refined A-translation. Although syntactically different, it also has the same computational complexity as the original program yielded by the refined A-translation from the undistorted input classical Fibonacci proof.","authors":["Dan Hernest"],"meta":["June 2007Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 171(3):43-53","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2006.10.050","SourceDBLP"],"references":["279262086_More_feasible_programs_from_non-constructive_proofs_by_the_Light_Monotone_Dialectica_interpretation","257826707_The_Warshall_Algorithm_and_Dickson's_Lemma_Two_Examples_of_Realistic_Program_Extraction","247281747_Proof_Mining_A_Systematic_Way_of_Analysing_Proofs_in_Mathematics","237705418_Light_Functional_Interpretation_An_Optimization_of_Godel's_Technique_Towards_the_Extraction_of_More_Efficient_Programs_from_Classical_Proofs","344896187_Some_logical_metatheorems_with_applications_in_functional_analysis","254774255_Metamathematical_Investigation_of_Intuitionistic_Arithmetic_and_Analysis_Second_corrected_Edition","251185692_Some_Logical_Metatheorems_with_Applications_in_Functional_Analysis","239601765_Interpretation_of_analysis_by_means_of_functionals_of_finite_type","229889534_Uber_eine_bisher_noch_nicht_benutzte_Erweiterung_des_niten_Standpunktes","222929314_Uniform_Heyting_Arithmetic"]}
