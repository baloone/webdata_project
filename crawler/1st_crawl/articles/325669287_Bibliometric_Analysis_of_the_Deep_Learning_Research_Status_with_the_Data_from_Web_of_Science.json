{"id":"325669287_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_Deep_Learning_Research_Status_with_the_Data_from_Web_of_Science","abstract":"By using the 3599 papers obtained from the Web of Science database from 1968 to 2018 as the research sample, this paper demonstrates a comprehensive Bibliometric analysis of the research status, trends and hotspots in the domain of Deep Learning. The results indicate that the current global deep learning research is of great value; most of the institution cooperation are conducted with different characteristics by colleges and universities in China and Western Countries, respectively; the international academic communications in the deep learning field are pretty prosperous, which are concentrated on three major region: East Asia, North America, and West Europe. In addition, the current research hotspots, such as modeling and algorithm research can be shown in a keywords clustering mapping, and the current research fronts can be categorized into three layers: the application research of computer vision technology, the algorithm research, and the modeling research.","authors":["Meixin Mao","Zili Li","Zhao Zhao","Zeng li"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-93803-5_55","In book: Data Mining and Big Data (pp.585-595)"],"references":["320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","277411157_Deep_Learning","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","221080071_Transforming_Auto-Encoders","220320676_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders_Learning_Useful_Representations_in_a_Deep_Network_with_a_Local_Denoising_Criterion","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","28674282_CiteSpace_II_Detecting_and_visualizing_emerging_trends_and_transient_patterns_in_scientific_literature","24217912_Trace_Ratio_Problem_Revisited","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309186321_A_practical_guide_to_training_restricted_boltzmann_machinesJ","291154417_Deep_learning_yesterday_today_and_tomorrow","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","269280573_Reading_Text_in_the_Wild_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267554204_Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","259335300_DeepPose_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Deep_Neural_Networks","254309091_Learning_Deep_Searched","51050318_A_Connection_Between_Score_Matching_and_Denoising_Autoencoders","12985939_Strategic_technology_management","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks"]}
