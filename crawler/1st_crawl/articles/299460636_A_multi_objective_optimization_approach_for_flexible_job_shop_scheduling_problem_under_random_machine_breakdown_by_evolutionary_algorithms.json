{"id":"299460636_A_multi_objective_optimization_approach_for_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_under_random_machine_breakdown_by_evolutionary_algorithms","abstract":"This paper addresses the stable scheduling of multi-objective problem in flexible job shop scheduling with random machine breakdown. Recently, numerous studies are conducted about robust scheduling; however, implementing a scheme which prevents a tremendous change between scheduling and after machine breakdown (preschedule and realized schedule, respectively) can be critical for utilizing available resources. The stability of the schedule can be detected by a slight deviation of start and completion time of each job between preschedule and realized schedule under the uncertain conditions. In this paper, two evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II and NRGA, are applied to combine the improvement of makespan and stability simultaneously. A simulation approach is used to evaluate the state and condition of the machine breakdowns. After the introduction of the evaluation criteria, the proposed algorithms are tested on a variety of benchmark problems. Finally, through performing statistical tests, the algorithm with higher performance in each criterion is identified.","authors":["Ehsan Ahmadi","Mostafa Zandieh","Mojtaba Farrokh","Seyed Mohammad
