{"id":"221013481_Indexing_Circular_Patterns","abstract":"This paper deals with the Circular Pattern Matching Problem (CPM). In CPM, we are interested in pattern matching between the text T and the cir- cular pattern C(P) of a given pattern P = P1 :::Pm. The circular pattern C(P) is formed by concatenating P1 to the right of Pm. We can view C(P) as a set of m patterns starting at positions j 2 (1::m) and wrapping around the end and if any of these patterns matches T , we flnd a match for C(P). In this paper, we present two e-cient data structures to index circular patterns. This problem has applications in pattern matching in geometric and astronomical data as well as in computer graphics and bioinformatics.","authors":["Costas Iliopoulos","Mohammad Sohel Rahman"],"meta":["February 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-77891-2_5","SourceDBLP","Conference: WALCOM: Algorithms and Computation, Second International Workshop, WALCOM 2008, Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 7-8, 2008."],"references":["271453316_Pattern_matching_with_address_errors_Rearrangement_distances","227127494_Fast_parallel_Lyndon_factorization_and_applications","346418463_Jewels_of_Stringology_Text_Algorithms","319394814_Algorithms_on_strings_trees_and_sequences_computer_science_and_computational_biology","278797241_Algorithmique_du_texte","275174089_Necklaces_of_beads_in_k_colors_and_k-ary_de_bruijn_sequences","239577876_STACS_96_13th_Annual_Symposium_on_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Computer_Science_Grenoble_France_February_22-24_1996_Proceedings","229067720_On-Line_Construction_of_Suffix_Trees","222921882_Maiorana_J_Necklaces_of_beads_in_k_colors_and_k-ary_de_Bruijn_sequences_Discrete_Math_233_207-210","222770225_Lyndon_factorization_of_sturmian_words"]}
