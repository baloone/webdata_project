{"id":"327661782_The_vertex_k_-cut_problem","abstract":"Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), a vertex k-cut of G is a vertex subset of V the removing of which disconnects the graph in at least k components. Given a graph G and an integer k≥2, the vertex k-cut problem consists in finding a vertex k-cut of G of minimum cardinality. We first prove that the problem is NP-hard for any fixed k≥3. We then present a compact formulation, and an extended formulation from which we derive a column generation and a branching scheme. Extensive computational results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","authors":["Denis Cornaz","Fabio Furini","Mathieu Lacroix","Enrico Malaguti"],"meta":["September 2018Discrete Optimization 31(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.disopt.2018.07.003"],"references":["287367130_Mathematical_formulations_for_the_Balanced_Vertex_k-Separator_Problem","283515952_THE_MULTI-TERMINAL_VERTEX_SEPARATOR_PROBLEM_POLYHEDRAL_ANALYSIS_AND_BRANCH-AND-_CUT","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","313135059_The_Asymmetric_Median_Tree_-_A_New_Model_for_Building_Consensus_Trees","284685941_Branch_and_Price_Column_generation_for_solving_huge_integer_programs","279920232_An_NC_algorithm_for_minimum_cuts","264993463_The_k-Separator_Problem","262488808_Discrete_Convexity_and_Polynomial_Solvability_in_Minimum_0-Extension_Problems","259540606_Complexity_and_Approximability_of_the_k-Way_Vertex_Cut","243659375_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_the_k-cut_Problem_for_Fixed_k"]}
