{"id":"281896177_Circular_coloring_of_signed_graphs","abstract":"Let $k, d$ ($2d \\leq k)$ be two positive integers. We generalize the well\nstudied notions of $(k,d)$-colorings and of the circular chromatic number\n$\\chi_c$ to signed graphs. This implies a new notion of colorings of signed\ngraphs, and the corresponding chromatic number $\\chi$. Some basic facts on\ncircular colorings of signed graphs and on the circular chromatic number are\nproved, and differences to the results on unsigned graphs are analyzed. In\nparticular, we show that the difference between the circular chromatic number\nand the chromatic number of a signed graph is at most 1. Indeed, there are\nsigned graphs where the difference is 1. On the other hand, for a signed graph\non $n$ vertices, if the difference is smaller than 1, then there exists\n$\\epsilon_n>0$, such that the difference is at most $1 - \\epsilon_n$.\nWe also show that notion of $(k,d)$-colorings is equivalent to $r$-colorings\n(see (X.
