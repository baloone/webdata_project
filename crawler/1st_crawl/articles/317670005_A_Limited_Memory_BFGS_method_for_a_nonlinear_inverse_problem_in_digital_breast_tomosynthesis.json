{"id":"317670005_A_Limited_Memory_BFGS_method_for_a_nonlinear_inverse_problem_in_digital_breast_tomosynthesis","abstract":"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an imaging technique that allows the reconstruction of a pseudo three-dimensional image of the breast from a finite number of low-dose two-dimensional projections obtained by different x-ray tube angles. An issue that is often ignored in DBT is the fact that an x-ray beam is polyenergetic, i.e. it is composed of photons with different levels of energy. The polyenergetic model requires solving a large-scale, nonlinear inverse problem, which is more expensive than the typically used simplified, linear monoenergetic model. However, the polyenergetic model is much less susceptible to beam hardening artifacts, which show up as dark streaks and cupping (i.e. background nonuniformities) in the reconstructed image. In addition, it has been shown that the polyenergetic model can be exploited to obtain additional quantitative information about the material of the object being imaged. In this paper we consider the multimaterial polyenergetic DBT model, and solve the nonlinear inverse problem with a limited memory BFGS quasi-Newton method. Regularization is enforced at each iteration using a diagonally modified approximation of the Hessian matrix, and by truncating the iterations.","authors":["Elena loli piccolomini","Germana Landi","James G Nagy"],"meta":["June 2017Inverse Problems 33(9)","DOI:10.1088/1361-6420/aa7a20"],"references":["284218148_Numerical_solution_of_a_nonlinear_least_squares_problem_in_digital_breast_tomosynthesis","283761902_An_algorithm_for_constrained_one-step_inversion_of_spectral_CT_data","234087097_Comparison_of_Digital_Mammography_Alone_and_Digital_Mammography_Plus_Tomosynthesis_in_a_Population-based_Screening_Program","224070844_A_scaled_gradient_projection_for_constrained_image_deblurring","6707105_A_comparative_study_of_limited-angle_cone-beam_reconstruction_methods_for_breast_tomosynthesis","267482427_Iterative_Breast_Tomosynthesis_Image_Reconstruction","230675261_Ill-Posed_Problems_Theory_and_Applications","226174686_On_the_Limited_Memory_BFGS_Method_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","224877332_Nocedal_J_Updating_Quasi-Newton_Matrices_with_Limited_Storage_Math_Comp_35_773-782","220124387_Numerical_Algorithms_for_Polyenergetic_Digital_Breast_Tomosynthesis_Reconstruction","51968457_Limited-memory_BFGS_Systems_with_Diagonal_Updates","22369302_Beam_hardening_in_X_ray_reconstructive_tomography","19162031_Fast_calculation_of_the_exact_radiological_path_for_a_three-dimensional_CT_array","11436589_Statistical_Image_Reconstruction_for_Polyenergetic_X-Ray_Computed_Tomography","10584198_Segmentation-Free_Statistical_Image_Reconstruction_for_Polyenergetic_X-Ray_Computed_Tomography_with_Experimental_Validation","6451815_Alternating_Minimization_Algorithms_for_Transmission_Tomography"]}
