{"id":"303207856_Learning_Through_Group_Work_in_the_College_Classroom_Evaluating_the_Evidence_from_an_Instructional_Goal_Perspective","abstract":"Early conceptions of group work seemed easy to understand and intuitively appealing to faculty as well as relatively simple to implement. As use in the classroom and research on the process continued, ideas about learning from group work became more and more complex. In this chapter, we describe the research on instructional innovations related to group work, not from the perspective of their underlying theory, but organized by the goals that instructors are trying to reach. In particular, we structure this chapter around some fairly universal instructional goals for the postsecondary classroom: knowledge acquisition, knowledge application, knowledge creation, and disciplinary discourse acquisition.\nHaving reviewed the current research explicating nine group instructional interventions, from jigsaw technique to computer-mediated discussion, we conclude with suggestions for future developments in theory, research, and instruction. In particular, we see a need for continued work on the particulars of how groups manage their work, accompanied by a broader systems-based theoretical perspective, and improvements in practice based more purposefully on instructional goals.","authors":["Marilla D.
