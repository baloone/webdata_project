{"id":"228824472_On_the_use_of_electron-multiplying_CCDs_for_astronomical_spectroscopy","abstract":"Conventional CCD detectors have two major disadvantages: they are slow to read out and they suffer from read noise. These\nproblems combine to make high-speed spectroscopy of faint targets the most demanding of astronomical observations. It is possible\nto overcome these weaknesses by using electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs). EMCCDs are conventional frame-transfer CCDs, but\nwith an extended serial register containing high-voltage electrodes. An avalanche of secondary electrons is produced as the\nphoton-generated electrons are clocked through this register, resulting in signal amplification that renders the read noise\nnegligible. Using a combination of laboratory measurements with the QUCAM2 EMCCD camera and Monte Carlo modelling, we show\nthat it is possible to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an observation by using an EMCCD, but only if it\nis optimized and utilized correctly. We also show that even greater gains are possible through the use of photon counting.\nWe present a recipe for astronomers to follow when setting up a typical EMCCD observation which ensures that maximum signal-to-noise\nratio is obtained. We also discuss the benefits that EMCCDs would bring if used with the next generation of extremely large\ntelescopes. Although we mainly consider the spectroscopic use of EMCCDs, our conclusions are equally applicable to imaging.","authors":["S. M. Tulloch","V. S.
