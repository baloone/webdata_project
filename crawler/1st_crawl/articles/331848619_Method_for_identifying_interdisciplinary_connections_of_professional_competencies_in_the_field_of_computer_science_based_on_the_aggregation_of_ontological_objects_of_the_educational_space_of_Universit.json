To achieve a new level\nand quality of IT education, it was proposed to develop an innovative component of the methodology for training future specialists,\nensuring the continuous expansion and improvement of functional interrelations in the structure of interdisciplinary competencies. To\nachieve this goal, in this article a system was developed to create relevant ontological entities in the field of professional competences\nin the field of computing for their subsequent ontological analysis. And in order to create a repository of the formed area of competence\nentities that is constantly updated with ontologies, it is recommended to expand the capabilities of the mechanism for organizing\nand operating the base of formal expressions and objective structures for ontological modeling.","authors":["Alyona Khar","Gregory Korotenko","Leonid Korotenko"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.31174/SEND-PP2019-187VII76-07","Projects: The innovative role of programming standards in the development of the DevOps methodologyРозробка і впровадження методичного та інформаційного забезпечення спеціалізованих курсів геоінформаційної спрямованості"],"references":[]}
