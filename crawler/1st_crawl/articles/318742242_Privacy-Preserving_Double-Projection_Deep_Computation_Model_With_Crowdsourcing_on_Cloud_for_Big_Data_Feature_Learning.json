{"id":"318742242_Privacy-Preserving_Double-Projection_Deep_Computation_Model_With_Crowdsourcing_on_Cloud_for_Big_Data_Feature_Learning","abstract":"Recent years have witness a considerable advance of Internet of Things with the tremendous progress of communication theories and sensing technologies. A large number of data, usually referring to big data, have been generated from Internet of Things. In this paper, we present a double-projection deep computation model (DPDCM) for big data feature learning, which projects the raw input into two separate subspaces in the hidden layers to learn interacted features of big data by replacing the hidden layers of the conventional deep computation model (DCM) with double-projection layers. Furthermore, we devise a learning algorithm to train the double-projection deep computation model. Cloud computing is used to improve the training efficiency of the learning algorithm by crowdsourcing the data on cloud. To protect the private data, a privacy-preserving double-projection deep computation model (PPDPDCM) is proposed based on the BGV encryption scheme. Finally, experiments are carried on Animal-20 and NUS-WIDE-14 to estimate the performance of DPDCM and PPDPDCM by comparing with DCM. Results demonstrate that DPDCM achieves a higher classification accuracy than DCM. More importantly, PPDPDCM can effectively improve the efficiency for training parameters, proving its potential for big data feature learning.","authors":["Qingchen Zhang","Laurence Tianruo Yang","Zhikui Chen","Peng Li"],"meta":["July 2017IEEE Internet of Things Journal PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JIOT.2017.2732735"],"references":["304006568_Bi-level_Protected_Compressive_Sampling","286019551_A_Distributed_Weighted_Possibilistic_c-Means_Algorithm_for_Clustering_Incomplete_Big_Sensor_Data","283282400_Determining_driver_phone_use_leveraging_smartphone_sensors","221345149_Multimodal_Deep_Learning","220144425_A_Wireless_Wearable_ECG_Sensor_for_Long-Term_Applications","3410575_Toward_a_Miniaturized_Wireless_Fluorescence-Based_Diagnostic_Imaging_System","319075475_A_Tucker_Deep_Computation_Model_for_Mobile_Multimedia_Feature_Learning","317573396_Mobile_Crowdsensing_in_Software_Defined_Opportunistic_Networks","317297004_Computation_Outsourcing_Meets_Lossy_Channel_Secure_Sparse_Robustness_Decoding_Service_in_Multi-Clouds","316751642_PPHOPCM_Privacy-preserving_High-order_Possibilistic_c-Means_Algorithm_for_Big_Data_Clustering_with_Cloud_Computing","315960379_High-order_Possibilistic_c-Means_Algorithms_Based_on_Tensor_Decompositions_for_Big_Data_in_IoT","315473795_An_Incremental_CFS_Algorithm_for_Clustering_Large_Data_in_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","314268805_A_Privacy-preserving_High-order_Neuro-Fuzzy_c-Means_Algorithm_with_Cloud_Computing","314250955_Multimedia_Processing_Pricing_Strategy_in_GPU-Accelerated_Cloud_Computing","310824628_Distributed_Feature_Selection_for_Efficient_Economic_Big_Data_Analysis","307815999_Composite_event_coverage_in_wireless_sensor_networks_with_heterogeneous_sensors","283767977_Deep_Computation_Model_for_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_on_Big_Data","283165247_Privacy_Preserving_Deep_Computation_Model_on_Cloud_for_Big_Data_Feature_Learning","282492668_Information_and_communications_technologies_for_elderly_ubiquitous_healthcare_in_a_smart_home","281360808_Distributed_fuzzy_c-means_algorithms_for_big_sensor_data_based_on_cloud_computing","278650457_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","276520130_Energy_Efficiency_and_Contact_Opportunities_Trade-off_in_Opportunistic_Mobile_Networks","273396259_Cross-Domain_Feature_Learning_in_Multimedia","270773379_MobiFuzzyTrust_An_Efficient_Fuzzy_Trust_Inference_Mechanism_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","267554204_Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","265471142_An_Optimized_Computational_Model_for_Multi-Community-Cloud_Social_Collaboration","262771844_Big_Data_Deep_Learning_Challenges_and_Perspectives","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","261330185_A_nodes_scheduling_model_based_on_Markov_chain_prediction_for_big_streaming_data_analysis_NODE_SCHEDULING_MODEL_FOR_BIG_DATA","261229621_A_Universal_Storage_Architecture_for_Big_Data_in_Cloud_Environment","260700607_The_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Network_With_Applications_to_Large_Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition","252061913_U-Health_Smart_Home","220138781_Leveled_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_without_Bootstrapping"]}
