{"id":"312944611_Gyrokinetic_simulations_of_turbulent_transport","abstract":"This overview is an assessment of the gyrokinetic framework and simulations to compute turbulent transport in fusion plasmas. It covers an introduction to the gyrokinetic theory, the principal numerical techniques which are being used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, fundamentals in gyrokinetic turbulence and the main results which have been brought by simulations with regard to transport in fusion devices and fluctuation measurements.","authors":["Xavier Garbet","Y.
