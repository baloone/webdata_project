{"id":"343509665_Performance_Analysis_of_Search_Algorithms_on_Workstation_System","abstract":"Searching is a common issue in computer science. It is defined as a process in which elements are to be found from a given list. Search algorithms used in daily life for finding values in array or list, data retrieving, finding passwords and combinations, etc. In the past, many search algorithms have been introduced and existing ones have been improved keeping a view of performance in terms of time and space complexity. Search algorithms are defined based on their framework. Well-known types of search algorithms are binary, linear, jump, and interpolation search. Binary search (interval, logarithmic search) is defined as a search algorithm, which finds the position of an element or target value within a sorted array; linear search (sequential search) is a search over the list of items in a sequential way (step-by-step process). Jump search focuses on fewer elements by jumping (skipping) to the next elements in fixed steps while Interpolation search is an improvement over binary search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched.In this paper, we have performed a comparative analysis of these search algorithms on the workstation system. Lenovo S-20 workstation with windows as an operating system is used for experimentation and analysis. Finding out which search algorithm is best in an associated scenario with a comparison of a single-core processor to a workstation of a six-core processor.","authors":["Mubashir Ali","Affan Abbas","Maaz Asghar"],"meta":["July 2020"],"references":[]}
