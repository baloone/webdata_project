{"id":"283028131_Node_connectivity_Energy_and_Bandwidth_Aware_Clustering_Routing_Algorithm_for_real-time_traffic_multicasting_in_MANET","abstract":"Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a decentralized communication network. In MANET during real time traffic multicasting, there is increased energy consumption and delay. In order to overcome this issue we propose to design Node connectivity, Energy and Bandwidth Aware Clustering Routing Algorithm. An efficient ENB cluster head selection algorithm [1] based on the combination of important matrices Residual Energy (E), Node connectivity (C) and Available Bandwidth (B) is considered for election of the cluster head efficiently. The multimedia stream splits into multiple sub-streams prior to transmission using Top-N rule selection approach algorithm [2]. Shortest path multicast tree construction algorithm [3] to transmit the real time traffic effectively among the nodes in MANETS. Using the cluster head as group leaders and cluster members as leaf nodes, a shortest path multicast tree is established. With the help of constructed shortest path multicast tree we are proposing Node connectivity, Energy and Bandwidth Aware Clustering Routing Algorithm.","authors":["Sapna B Kulkarni","B.N.
