{"id":"305750555_Challenges_and_Best_Practices_in_Industry-Academia_Collaborations_in_Software_Engineering_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Context: The global software industry and the software engineering (SE) academia are two large communities. However, unfortunately, the level of joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. It seems that the two ’camps’ show only limited interest/motivation to collaborate with one other. Many researchers and practitioners have written about the challenges, success patterns (what to do, i.e., how to collaborate) and anti-patterns (what not do do) for industry-academia collaborations.","authors":["Vahid Garousi","Kai Petersen","Baris Özkan"],"meta":["July 2016Information and Software Technology 79","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2016.07.006","Project: IndAcSE: Meta-analysis of Industry-Academia Collaborations in Software Engineering"],"references":["314562766_Universities-Industry_Collaboration_A_Systematic_Review","303515568_The_need_for_multivocal_literature_reviews_in_software_engineering_complementing_systematic_literature_reviews_with_grey_literature","301773252_When_and_what_to_automate_in_software_testing_A_multi-vocal_literature_review","296683976_Citations_research_topics_and_active_countries_in_software_engineering_A_bibliometrics_study","288667578_Universities-industry_collaboration_A_systematic_review","282524329_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_the_Turkish_software_engineering_research_community","313390246_Basics_of_qualitative_research_Grounded_theory_procedures_and_techniques","275156960_Guidelines_for_conducting_systematic_mapping_studies_in_software_engineering_An_update","273630699_Finding_Relevant_Research_Solutions_for_Practical_Problems_-_the_SERP_Taxonomy_Architecture","272476025_Foundations_for_Long-Term_Collaborative_Research"]}
