{"id":"321532783_Auditoria_de_seguridad_informatica_siguiendo_la_metodologia_OSSTMMv3_caso_de_estudio","abstract":"This article explains the methodology followed in computing auditing in terms of security where OSSTMM version 3 was taken as reference methodology and implemented in GAD-Mira. The current methodology allows to measure the security aspects of five different channels such as human, physical, wireless communications, telecommunications, and networking. At the same time, it includes porosity (OpSec), controls, and limitations as three important measures in each channel which allow to calculate and get the numerical values that explain the importance and influence of each item in the computing audit. Additionally, results obtained after the application of the described methodology allowed to understand deficiencies or excesses in terms of security controls that exist in a company or organization in each channel, being an important point to analyze the internal vulnerabilities that need to be solved.","authors":["Cristian Leonel Bracho","Fabián Cuzme-Rodríguez","Carlos Hernán Pupiales Yépez","Luis Suárez Zambrano"],"meta":["November 2017","In book: ACTAS DEL QUINTO CONGRESO ECUATORIANO DE TECNOLOGÍAS DE LA INFORMACIÓN Y COMUNICACIÓN - TIC.EC 2017 (pp.307-319)Edition: EspecialPublisher: Universidad de Cuenca","Project: Seguridad en Objetos Inteligentes"],"references":["45634930_Perfil_sobre_los_delitos_informaticos_en_el_Ecuador"]}
