{"id":"273339171_Limit_laws_for_functions_of_fringe_trees_for_binary_search_trees_and_random_recursive_trees","abstract":"We prove general limit theorems for sums of functions of subtrees of (random) binary search trees and random recursive trees. The proofs use a new version of a representation by Devroye, and Stein's method for both normal and Poisson approximation together with certain couplings. As a consequence, we give simple new proofs of the fact that the number of fringe trees of size k = k(n) in the binary search tree or in the random recursive tree (of total size n) has an asymptotical Poisson distribution if k -> infinity, and that the distribution is asymptotically normal for k = o(root n). Furthermore, we prove similar results for the number of subtrees of size k with some required property P, e.g., the number of copies of a certain fixed subtree T. Using the Cramer-Wold device, we show also that these random numbers for different fixed subtrees converge jointly to a multivariate normal distribution. We complete the paper by giving examples of applications of the general results, e.g., we obtain a normal limit law for the number of l-protected nodes in a binary search tree or in a random recursive tree.","authors":["Cecilia Holmgren","Svante Janson"],"meta":["January 2015ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY 20","DOI:10.1214/EJP.v20-3627"],"references":["284670241_A_limit_theorem_for_Quicksort","259420889_Limit_Theorems_for_Subtree_Size_Profiles_of_Increasing_Trees","257299329_Protected_nodes_and_fringe_subtrees_in_some_random_trees","220533452_Phase_Changes_in_Subtree_Varieties_in_Random_Recursive_and_Binary_Search_Trees","220357597_Subtree_Sizes_in_Recursive_Trees_and_Binary_Search_Trees_Berry-Esseen_Bounds_and_Poisson_Approximations","220224370_Profiles_of_Random_Trees_Limit_Theorems_for_Random_Recursive_Trees_and_Binary_Search_Trees","220165370_A_Limiting_Distribution_for_Quicksort","26237976_Limit_theorems_for_patterns_in_phylogenetic_trees","2482937_Phase_Change_of_Limit_Laws_in_the_Quicksort_Recurrence_Under_Varying_Toll_Functions","2135736_The_mean_variance_and_limiting_distribution_of_two_statistics_sensitive_to_phylogenetic_tree_balance","261065509_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_ternary_search_trees","257294253_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_random_binary_search_trees","243105052_On_the_Variety_of_Shapes_on_the_Fringe_of_a_Random_Recursive_Tree","236263770_K-Protected_vertices_in_binary_search_trees","229712110_Asymptotic_Joint_Normality_of_Outdegrees_of_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","227705379_Limit_Laws_for_Local_Counters_in_Random_Binary_Search_Tree","222649757_Singularity_analysis_Hadamard_products_and_tree_recurrences","222219459_Distribution_of_nodes_of_a_tree_by_degree","220617534_Limit_Laws_for_Sums_of_Functions_of_Subtrees_of_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","220357888_On_the_Subtree_Size_Profile_of_Binary_Search_trees","220345411_Patterns_in_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","220345355_On_the_distribution_of_binary_search_trees_under_the_random_permutation_model","220317676_Protected_points_in_ordered_trees","38363009_Asymptotic_Fringe_Distributions_for_General_Families_of_Random_Trees","2476231_Asymptotic_Degree_Distribution_In_Random_Recursive_Trees","2335960_Multiway_Trees_of_Maximum_and_Minimum_Probability_Under_the_Random_Permutation_Model","2107317_Transfer_Theorems_and_Asymptotic_Distributional_Results_for_m-ary_Search_Trees"]}
