{"id":"328367484_Robotic_Arm_Manipulation_Under_IEC_61499_and_ROS-based_Compatible_Control_Scheme","abstract":"Currently, the generation of traditional and straight-line production systems are being replaced with the objective of generating flexible and modular production systems. To achieve this goal, one of the main alternatives used by enterprises is the integration of robotic systems in the production cells. This robotic integration, indirectly allows robots to be compatible with the concepts of Smart Factories and Industry 4.0, where the high processing and communication capacities of the devices allows better and faster data exchange among the devices conforming the system. IEC-61499 proposes an architecture for the generation of distributed and modular production systems under Industry 4.0 paradigm. This paper proposes the development of an based IEC-61499 agile architecture implementation using a low-cost controller as Raspberry Pi 3B for control of KUKA youBotâ„¢ industrial robotic arm in a Pick and Place process.","authors":["Carlos A.
