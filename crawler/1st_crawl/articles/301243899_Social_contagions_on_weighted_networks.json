{"id":"301243899_Social_contagions_on_weighted_networks","abstract":"We investigate critical behaviors of a social contagion model on weighted networks. An edge-weight compartmental approach is applied to analyze the weighted social contagion on strongly heterogenous networks with skewed degree and weight distributions. We find that degree heterogeneity can not only alter the nature of contagion transition from discontinuous to continuous but also can enhance or hamper the size of adoption, depending on the unit transmission probability. We also show that, the heterogeneity of weight distribution always hinder social contagions, and does not alter the transition type.","authors":["Yu-Xiao Zhu","Wei Wang","Ming Tang","Yong-Yeol Ahn"],"meta":["April 2016PHYSICAL REVIEW E 96(1)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.96.012306"],"references":["282899464_Complex_contagions_and_hybrid_phase_transitions","281768757_Dynamics_of_social_contagions_with_heterogeneous_adoption_thresholds_Crossover_phenomena_in_phase_transition","280104915_Dynamics_of_social_contagions_with_memory_of_non-redundant_information","279160388_Numerical_identification_of_epidemic_thresholds_for_susceptible-infected-recovered_model_on_finite-size_networks","276851952_Dynamics_of_social_contagions_with_limited_contact_capacity","275896883_Analysis_and_Control_of_Epidemics_A_Survey_of_Spreading_Processes_on_Complex_Networks","265394968_Optimal_Network_Modularity_for_Information_Diffusion","263663250_Epidemic_spreading_on_complex_networks_with_general_degree_and_weight_distributions","259354299_Epidemic_Spread_on_Weighted_Networks","258100764_Complex_Networks_Structure_Robustness_and_Function","257866651_An_epidemic_model_of_rumor_diffusion_in_online_social_networks","256188948_Virality_Prediction_and_Community_Structure_in_Social_Networks","235397852_A_Class_of_Pairwise_Models_for_Epidemic_Dynamics_on_Weighted_Networks","234066704_Slow_epidemic_extinction_in_populations_with_heterogeneous_infection_rates","51967549_Reinforcement-Driven_Spread_of_Innovations_and_Fads","51394417_Cascades_on_correlated_and_modular_random_networks","51219851_Effects_of_Heterogeneous_and_Clustered_Contact_Patterns_on_Infectious_Disease_Dynamics","49714437_Critical_effect_of_dependency_groups_on_the_function_of_networks","48803295_Analysis_of_a_large-scale_weighted_network_of_one-to-one_human_communication","46124439_The_Spread_of_Behavior_in_an_Online_Social_Network_Experiment","12044107_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Scale-Free_Networks","12040569_Global_stability_of_an_SEIS_epidemic_model_with_recruitment_and_a_varying_total_population_size","8464592_Universal_Behavior_in_a_Generalized_Model_of_Contagion","8463949_Dynamics_of_Rumor_Spreading_in_Complex_Networks","7888174_The_architecture_of_complex_weighted_networks","6171520_SIR_dynamics_in_random_networks_with_heterogeneous_connectivity","5875634_Adaptive_Coevolutionary_Networks_A_Review","1828565_Epidemic_outbreaks_in_complex_heterogeneous_networks","1825780_Epidemic_Spread_in_Weighted_Scale-Free_Networks","1770779_Statistical_physics_of_social_dynamics","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","267922562_The_Diffusion_of_Innovations","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","264708826_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","256098455_Nature_of_the_Epidemic_Threshold_for_the_Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible_Dynamics_in_Networks","243773399_Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Chaos_With_Applications_to_Physics","233821252_Threshold_Models_of_Collective_Behavior","230818214_Dynamic_Models_of_Segregation","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","220693394_Networks_Crowds_and_Markets_Reasoning_About_A_Highly_Connected_World","51968080_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Weighted_Networks_An_Edge-Based_Mean-Field_Solution","51964964_Temporal_Networks","9372621_Generalization_of_Epidemic_Theory_An_Application_to_the_Transmission_of_Ideas","9341621_Epidemics_and_Rumours_49","7952588_Pastor-Satorras_R_Generation_of_uncorrelated_random_scale-free_networks","7289929_Non-Mean-Field_Behavior_of_the_Contact_Process_on_Scale-Free_Networks","7200421_A_Simple_Model_of_Global_Cascades_on_Random_Networks","2605577_Newman_MEJ_The_structure_and_function_of_complex_networks_SIAM_Rev_45_167-256","1827666_Statistical_Mechanics_Of_Complex_Networks"]}
