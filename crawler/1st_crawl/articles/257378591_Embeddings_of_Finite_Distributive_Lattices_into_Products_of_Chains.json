Gierz and Stralka showed that in the infinite case there is one efficient way to subdirectly embed a connected, full-valued distributive lattice of finite breadth n into a product of n complete, connected chains [5].\nIn this paper, we consider embeddings of finite distributive lattices into products of chains. We characterize an embedding due to Ky Fan as one which preserves covering relations, and show that any embeddings can be modified so that the resulting embedding has this property. We also show that if an embedding of a finite distributive lattice of breadth n into a product of n chains preserves breadth of intervals then the original lattice must have already been a product of chains.","authors":["Naw Rebecca"],"meta":["January 1998Semigroup Forum 56(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00233-002-7005-3"],"references":["242977319_On_Dilworth's_coding_theorem"]}
