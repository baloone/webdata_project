{"id":"279213363_Linking_Data_According_to_Their_Degree_of_Representativeness_DoR","abstract":"This contribution addresses the problem of extracting some representative data from complex datasets andconnecting them in a directed graph. First we define a degree of representativeness (DoR) inspired of theBorda voting procedure. Secondly we present a method to connect pairwise data using neighborhoods and theDoR as an objective function. We then present case studies as illustrative purposes: unsupervised grouping ofbinary images, analysis of co-authorships in a research team and structuration of a medical patient-orienteddatabase.","authors":["Frédéric Blanchard","Amine Aït-Younes","Michel Herbin"],"meta":["June 2015Industrial Networks and Intelligent Systems 2(4)","DOI:10.4108/inis.2.4.e2"],"references":["284537526_Robust_Regression_and_Outlier_Detection","247331493_Rank_Transformations_as_a_Bridge_Between_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistics_Rejoinder","225475610_SkyGraph_An_algorithm_for_important_subgraph_discovery_in_relational_graphs","221931549_Variants_of_the_Borda_count_method_for_combining_ranked_classifier_hypotheses","313366372_Finding_and_evaluating_community_structure_in_networks_Phys","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","276275611_Memoire_sur_les_Elections_au_Scrutin","271682700_The_Ordering_of_Multivariate_Data","257553293_Customer_relationship_management_and_Web_mining_The_next_frontier","227832506_Use_of_the_Bootstrap_in_Robust_Estimation_of_Location"]}
