{"id":"276160260_Identifying_influential_user_communities_on_the_social_network","abstract":"Nowadays social network services have been popularly used in electronic commerce systems. Users on the social network can develop different relationships based on their common interests and activities. In order to promote the business, it is interesting to explore hidden relationships among users developed on the social network. Such knowledge can be used to locate target users for different advertisements and to provide effective product recommendations. In this paper, we define and study a novel community detection problem that is to discover the hidden community structure in large social networks based on their common interests. We observe that the users typically pay more attention to those users who share similar interests, which enable a way to partition the users into different communities according to their common interests. We propose two algorithms to detect influential communities using common interests in large social networks efficiently and effectively. We conduct our experimental evaluation using a data set from Epinions, which demonstrates that our method achieves 4-11.8% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art method.","authors":["Weishu Hu","Zhiguo Gong","Ryan Leong Hou Uu","Jingzhi Guo"],"meta":["October 2013Enterprise Information Systems 9(7):709-724","DOI:10.1080/17517575.2013.804586"],"references":["277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","260626386_Improving_Multilingual_Semantic_Interoperation_in_Cross-Organizational_Enterprise_Systems_Through_Concept_Disambiguation","260626385_Using_Propositional_Logic_for_Requirements_Verification_of_Service_Workflow","257680575_Community-Aware_Resource_Profiling_for_Personalized_Search_in_Folksonomy","257516074_Multi-neighborhood_tabu_search_for_the_maximum_weight_clique_problem","242479489_Kumar_V_A_Fast_and_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_for_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs_SIAM_Journal_on_Scientific_Computing_201_359-392","241709205_Cloud_manufacturing_A_new_manufacturing_paradigm","233339677_Term_frequency_-_function_of_document_frequency_A_new_term_weighting_scheme_for_enterprise_information_retrieval","228532327_Accuracy_estimate_and_optimization_techniques_for_SimRank_computation","227659870_Understanding_and_Analysing_Activity_and_Learning_in_Virtual_Communities","225150765_An_Algorithm_to_Discover_the_k-Clique_Cover_in_Networks","221654678_Cost-effective_outbreak_detection_in_networks","221654460_Approximate_kernel_k-means_Solution_to_large_scale_kernel_clustering","221653426_Sparsification_of_influence_networks","221158778_SemTagP_Semantic_Community_Detection_in_Folksonomies","221157716_Coauthor_Network_Topic_Models_with_Application_to_Expert_Finding","221023694_Who_Says_What_to_Whom_on_Twitter","221022438_Topic_modeling_with_network_regularization","221021987_Exploring_Social_Annotations_for_the_Semantic_Web","221002874_A_Method_for_Group_Extraction_in_Complex_Social_Networks","220906887_Detecting_Communities_in_Social_Networks_Using_Max-Min_Modularity","220765221_SIMPATH_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Influence_Maximization_under_the_Linear_Threshold_Model","220693571_Tabu_search_I","45921089_Inferring_Networks_of_Diffusion_and_Influence","2797268_A_Fast_And_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_For_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs","260541962_Business_Intelligence_for_Enterprise_Systems_A_Survey","251621730_Community_detection_based_on_a_semantic_network","225230289_An_Application_of_Tabu_Search_Heuristic_for_the_Maximum_Edge-Weighted_Subgraph_Problem","221654441_Spectral_Clustering_in_Social_Networks","221654255_PET_A_Statistical_Model_for_Popular_Events_Tracking_in_Social_Communities","221653371_Community-based_Greedy_algorithm_for_mining_top-K_influential_nodes_in_mobile_social_networks","221653366_Social_influence_analysis_in_large-scale_networks","221653337_Efficient_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","221615540_Extraction_of_a_latent_blog_community_based_on_subject","221499738_Local_Graph_Partitioning_using_PageRank_Vectors","220765878_Entropy-Based_Graph_Clustering_Application_to_Biological_and_Social_Networks","220765720_Detecting_Community_Kernels_in_Large_Social_Networks","220366136_Enterprise_Systems_State-of-the-Art_and_Future_Trends","42090204_Business_information_query_expansion_through_semantic_network","8463952_Fast_algorithm_for_detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_Stat_Nonlin_Soft_Matter_Phys_696_Pt_2_066133","6768757_Finding_Community_Structure_in_Networks_Using_the_Eigenvectors_of_Matrices","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","1901675_Simrank_Query_rewriting_through_link_analysis_of_the_click_graph"]}
