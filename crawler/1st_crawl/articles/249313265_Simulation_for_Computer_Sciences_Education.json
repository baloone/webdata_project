{"id":"249313265_Simulation_for_Computer_Sciences_Education","abstract":"Computer Simulation is a powerful technique for education in many different fields. This paper will cover the use of Computer Simulation tools for Computer Sciences education. The paper will try to answer the following question: Are the simulation tools essential in Computer Sciences education or they are just a support method for helping the education process? Our paper will provide more details about using simulation for computer sciences disciplines such as software engineering. The paper will highlight the importance of using simulation tools by adding more insight into aspects of computer sciences functions that cannot easily observed in traditional laboratories.","authors":["Mouhib Alnoukari"],"meta":["January 2013"],"references":["241383494_Simulation_of_a_Campus_Backbone_Network_a_case-study","236135425_Handbook_of_Research_on_Discrete_Event_Simulation_Environments_Technologies_and_Applications_Library_of_Congress_Cataloging-in-Publication_Data","234800896_ESCAPE_Environment_for_the_simulation_of_computer_architectures_for_the_purpose_of_education","228880330_WebMIPS_a_new_web-based_MIPS_simulation_environment_for_computer_architecture_education","289004044_Introduction_to_Network_Simulator_2_NS2","262293621_Software_performance_or_engineering","237815275_Using_Online_Simulation_in_Teaching_Alternative_Analysis_and_Process_Optimization","228941180_DARC2_2_nd_generation_DLX_architecture_simulator","228850065_AN_INTERDISCILINARY_SIMULATION-BASED_LABORATORY_FOR_UNDERGRADUATE_WIRELESS_COMMUNICATIONS_EDUCATION","228605742_SATSim_A_superscalar_architecture_trace_simulator_using_interactive_animation"]}
