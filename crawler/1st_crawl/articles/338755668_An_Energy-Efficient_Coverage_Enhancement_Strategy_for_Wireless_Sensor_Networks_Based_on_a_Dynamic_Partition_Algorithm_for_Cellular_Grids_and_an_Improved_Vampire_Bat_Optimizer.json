To reach the optimal coverage effect with the lowest costs is a primary goal of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, by splicing the sensing area optimally with cellular grids, the best deployment location for sensors and the required minimum number of them are revealed. The optimization problem of coverage rate and energy consumption is converted into a task assignment problem, and a dynamic partition algorithm for cellular grids is also proposed to improve the coverage effect when the number of sensors is variable. Furthermore, on the basis of solving the multi-objective problem of reducing and balancing the energy cost of sensors, the vampire bat optimizer is improved by introducing virtual bats and virtual preys, and finally solves the asymmetric assignment problem once the number of cellular grids is not equal to that of sensors. Simulation results indicate that the residual energy of sensors during redeployment is balanced notably by our strategy when compared to three other popular coverage-enhancement algorithms. Additionally, the total energy cost of sensor nodes and coverage rate can be optimized, and it also has a superior robustness when the number of nodes changes.","authors":["Xiaoqiang Zhao","Yanpeng Cui","Zheng Guo","Zhanjun Hao"],"meta":["January 2020Sensors 20(3):619","DOI:10.3390/s20030619"],"references":["335271381_Node_optimization_coverage_method_under_link_model_in_passive_monitoring_system_of_three-dimensional_wireless_sensor_network","333874514_A_Virtual_Force_Algorithm-Levy-Embedded_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Coverage_Optimization","325532888_An_algorithm_for_calculating_coverage_rate_of_WSNs_based_on_geometry_decomposition_approach","337173747_Energy-efficient_Coverage_Enhancement_Strategy_for_Three-dimensional_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_a_Vampire_Bat_Optimizer","329350810_Data_Fusion_Based_Coverage_Optimization_in_Heterogeneous_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","328471936_Efficient_dispatch_of_mobile_sensors_in_a_WSN_with_wireless_chargers","328139590_A_PSO_based_energy_efficient_coverage_control_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","328095349_Energy-Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_Improved_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","327705561_Detecting_Confident_Information_Coverage_Holes_in_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_An_Energy-Efficient_Perspective","325979782_Differential_evolution_algorithm_applied_to_wireless_sensor_distribution_on_different_geometric_shapes_with_area_and_energy_optimization"]}
