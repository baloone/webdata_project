{"id":"338908024_Observation_and_Explanation_A_Guide_to_Philosophy_of_Science","abstract":"Norwood Russell Hanson (1924–1967) was a man out of his time, a character from the Florentine Renaissance growing up in the contemporary United States. Hanson showed how much can still be achieved, even within the professionalized technocratic society of the mid-twentieth century, by the true amateur: the man who makes himself the master of an art or science out of curiosity, love or sheer cussedness, quite unconnected with the business of earning a living. And he showed how such an amateur can achieve a kind of richness and variety of experience in a whole range of activities which spills over the boundaries between them. In this way, he became a “jack of many trades” and, in his own very special way, a master of them all.","authors":["Norwood Russell Hanson"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-94-024-1739-5_5","In book: What I Do Not Believe, and Other Essays (pp.81-121)"],"references":["320182102_Tractatus_logico-philosophicus_Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung","265317445_The_development_and_meaning_of_Eddington's_fundamental_theory_including_a_compilation_from_Eddington's_unpublished_manuscripts","232516128_Experience_and_prediction_An_analysis_of_the_foundations_and_the_structure_of_knowledge","31668204_La_theorie_physique_son_objet_-_sa_structure_P_Duhem"]}
