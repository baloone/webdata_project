The privacy of these digital information can be addressed by using different encryption mechanisms. We have proposed digital information privacy preserving scheme based on three-dimensional chaotic self-exciting single disk homopolar system. Moreover, we have designed a circuit implementations of three-dimensional chaotic self-exciting single disk homopolar dynamical system. The suggested encryption scheme is tested against different security performance analyses which clearly reflects the affectedness of our encryption scheme.","authors":["Noor Munir","Majid Khan","Zhouchao Wei","Akif Akgul"],"meta":["May 2020Wireless Networks","DOI:10.1007/s11276-020-02361-9","Project: Chaos based engineering applications (Chaotic circuits,  cryptology, steganography, PRNGs and TRNGs, microcomputers, FPGA based applications, etc.)"],"references":["345408351_Application_Based_Construction_and_Optimization_of_Substitution_Boxes_Over_2D_Mixed_Chaotic_Maps","344439041_A_new_construction_of_confusion_component_of_block_ciphers","341314638_A_New_Efficient_Digital_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Inverse_Left_Almost_Semi_Group_and_Lorenz_Chaotic_System","334024679_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_Arnold_scrambling_and_Lucas_series","333645502_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_technique_based_on_multiple_discrete_dynamical_maps","333580760_A_Novel_Digital_Contents_Privacy_Scheme_Based_on_Kramer's_Arbitrary_Spin","333152124_A_Novel_Image_Encryption_Technique_Based_on_Generalized_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Based_on_Field_of_Any_Characteristic","330941219_A_new_approach_to_digital_content_privacy_using_quantum_spin_and_finite-state_machine","329664237_Image_privacy_scheme_using_quantum_spinning_and_rotation","332111102_A_novel_image_steganography_technique_based_on_quantum_substitution_boxes","329495428_A_Generalization_of_Algebraic_Expression_for_Nonlinear_Component_of_Symmetric_Key_Algorithms_of_Any_Characteristic_p","329426862_Construction_of_new_S-boxes_based_on_triangle_groups_and_its_applications_in_copyright_protection","329048153_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_dynamical_spinning_and_rotations","327472565_Information_Confidentiality_Using_Quantum_Spinning_Rotation_and_Finite_State_Machine","325856101_Bifurcation_analysis_and_integrability_in_the_segmented_disc_dynamo_with_mechanical_friction"]}
