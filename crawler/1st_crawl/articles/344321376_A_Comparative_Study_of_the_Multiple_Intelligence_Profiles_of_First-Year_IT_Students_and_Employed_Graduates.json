{"id":"344321376_A_Comparative_Study_of_the_Multiple_Intelligence_Profiles_of_First-Year_IT_Students_and_Employed_Graduates","abstract":"The aim of the article is to determine in the studied groups the multiple intelligence distribution defined in the 1980s by Howard Gardner. The research was conducted in three groups of respondents. The first study group was first-year students of computer science, the second was master (2nd degree) students, educationally 4 years older than the first group. Their intelligence distributions were compared with the intelligence distributions of the third group-graduates of the same university, the same field of study after several years of work in positions consistent with their education. Participants filled one of the multiple intelligence tests selected by answering 24 questions. A group of approximately 110 students and approximately 40 IT employees were examined. As there were statistically justified differences in several significant sub intelligences, a discussion was held on the forms of educational impact on student development paths. The research was carried out in conditions of full voluntary participation in the test and on the basis of self-assessment according to questions suggested in one of the online sources. According to the authors, the results seem interesting, although surprising.","authors":["Antoni Wilinski","Lukasz Kupracz"],"meta":["October 2020Informatics in Education 19(3):491-517","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2020.22","Project: Multiply Intelligence"],"references":["20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_From_the_Perspective_of_the_Five-Factor_Model_of_Personality","292567399_The_educated_brain_Essays_in_neuroeducation","250182898_Educational_Implications_of_the_Theory_of_Multiple_Intelligences","228801548_Multiple_intelligences_after_twenty_years"]}
