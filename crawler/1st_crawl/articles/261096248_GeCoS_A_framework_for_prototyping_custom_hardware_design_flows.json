{"id":"261096248_GeCoS_A_framework_for_prototyping_custom_hardware_design_flows","abstract":"GeCoS is an open source framework that provide a highly productive environment for hardware design. GeCoS primarily targets custom hardware design using High Level Synthesis, distinguishing itself from classical compiler infrastructures. Compiling for custom hardware makes use of domain specific semantics that are not considered by general purpose compilers. Finding the right balance between various performance criteria, such as area, speed, and accuracy, is the goal, contrary to the typical goal in high performance context to maximize speed. The GeCoS infrastructure facilitates the prototyping of hardware design flows, going beyond compiler analyses and transformations. Hardware designers must interact with the compiler for design space exploration, and it is important to be able to give instant feedback to the users.","authors":["Antoine Floc'h","Tomofumi Yuki","Ali Moussawi","Antoine Morvan"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648190","Conference: Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM), 2013 IEEE 13th International Working Conference on"],"references":["262285653_How_Hard_Can_It_Be_Designing_and_Implementing_a_Deployable_Multipath_TCP","261200080_Strategic_evaluation_of_performance-cost_trade-offs_in_a_multipath_TCP_multihoming_context","261116821_Achieving_Sub-Second_Downtimes_in_Internet-wide_Virtual_Machine_Live_Migrations_in_LISP_Networks","313233437_The_locator_identifier_separation_protocol_LISP","312892186_SUIF_An_infrastructure_for_research_on_parallelizing_and_optimizing_compilers","289931502_AlphaZ_A_System_for_Design_Space_Exploration_in_the_Polyhedral_Model","271482946_Augmented_Multipath_TCP_Communications","269161217_Author_retrospective_for_semantical_interprocedural_parallelization_an_overview_of_the_PIPS_project","264922652_EMF_Eclipse_Modeling_Framework_20_2nd_Edition","261204502_Runtime_dependency_analysis_for_loop_pipelining_in_High-Level_Synthesis"]}
