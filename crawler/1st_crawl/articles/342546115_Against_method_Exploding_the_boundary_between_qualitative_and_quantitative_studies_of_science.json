{"id":"342546115_Against_method_Exploding_the_boundary_between_qualitative_and_quantitative_studies_of_science","abstract":"Quantitative and qualitative studies of science have historically played radically different roles with opposing epistemological commitments. Using large-scale text analysis, we see that qualitative studies generate and value new theory, especially regarding the complex social and political contexts of scientific action, while quantitative approaches confirm existing theory and evaluate the performance of scientific institutions. Large-scale digital data and emerging computational methods could allow us to refigure these positions, turning qualitative artifacts into quantitative patterns into qualitative insights across many scales, heralding a new era of theory development, engagement, and relevance for scientists, policy-makers, and society.","authors":["Donghyun Kang","James Evans"],"meta":["June 2020Quantitative Science Studies 1(16):930-944","DOI:10.1162/qss_a_00056"],"references":["332798160_Topic_Modeling_in_Management_Research_Rendering_New_Theory_from_Textual_Data","331085879_Large_teams_develop_and_small_teams_disrupt_science_and_technology","323502497_Science_of_science","316973825_Semantics_derived_automatically_from_language_corpora_contain_human-like_biases","306885285_Semantics_derived_automatically_from_language_corpora_necessarily_contain_human_biases","305615978_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_as_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings","301879866_Parallelizing_Word2Vec_in_Shared_and_Distributed_Memory","284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","259528314_The_Public_Understanding_of_Science","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","228067004_Heavy_use_of_equations_impedes_communication_among_biologists","45897301_Scientometrics_and_Communication_Theory_Towards_Theoretically_Informed_Indicators","340013589_Epistemic_Cultures_How_the_Sciences_Make_Knowledge","337299107_Computation_and_the_Sociological_Imagination","334115961_SemAxis_A_Lightweight_Framework_to_Characterize_Domain-Specific_Word_Semantics_Beyond_Sentiment","326630015_The_sociology_of_scientific_validity_How_professional_networks_shape_judgement_in_peer_review","324626520_The_Measurement_of_Meaning","324055041_The_Geometry_of_Culture_Analyzing_Meaning_through_Word_Embeddings","321241613_Word_Embeddings_Quantify_100_Years_of_Gender_and_Ethnic_Stereotypes","321217118_Computational_Grounded_Theory_A_Methodological_Framework","306093715_Diachronic_Word_Embeddings_Reveal_Statistical_Laws_of_Semantic_Change","297831694_The_two_cultures","287514944_Neural_word_embedding_as_implicit_matrix_factorization","286524453_Computational_Linguistics_and_Deep_Learning","279955453_Against_Method_Outline_of_an_Anarchistic_Theory_of_Knowledge","274650549_The_Economic_Institutions_of_Capitalism","274171768_The_Two_Cultures_and_the_Scientific_Revolution","273115564_Causal_Thinking_and_Ethnographic_Research","271652022_A_Pragmatist_Approach_to_Causality_in_Ethnography_1","269857633_A_Feeling_for_the_Organism_The_Life_and_Work_of_Barbara_McClintock","264390669_Why_Two_Heads_Apart_Are_Better_Than_Two_Heads_Together_Multiple_Mechanisms_Underlie_the_Collaborative_Inhibition_Effect_in_Memory","263048773_The_role_of_handbooks_in_knowledge_creation_and_diffusion_A_case_of_science_and_technology_studies","247935500_Main_Trends_in_Recent_Philosophy_Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism","247637052_Stages_in_the_Empirical_Programme_of_Relativism","238674409_Epistemic_Cultures_How_the_Sciences_Make_Knowledge","227996470_Semantic_Differential_Technique_in_the_Comparative_Study_of_Cultures1","201381748_The_Innovator's_Dilemma_When_New_Technologies_Cause_Great_Firms_To_Fail","37692909_Image_Logic_A_Material_Culture_of_Microphysics","30014760_Deconstruction_in_a_'Thinking'_Science_Theoretical_Physicists_at_Work","11548618_Voxels_in_the_Brain"]}
