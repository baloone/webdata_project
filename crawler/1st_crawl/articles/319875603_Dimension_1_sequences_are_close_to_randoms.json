{"id":"319875603_Dimension_1_sequences_are_close_to_randoms","abstract":"We show that a sequence has effective Hausdorff dimension 1 if and only if it is coarsely similar to a Martin-L\\\"{o}f random sequence. More generally, a sequence has effective dimension $s$ if and only if it is coarsely similar to a weakly $s$-random sequence. Further, for any $s<t$, every sequence of effective dimension $s$ can be changed on density at most $H^{-1}(t)-H^{-1}(s)$ of its bits to produce a sequence of effective dimension $t$, and this bound is optimal.","authors":["Noam Greenberg","Joe Miller","Alexander Shen","Linda Brown Westrick"],"meta":["September 2017Theoretical Computer Science 705","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.09.031"],"references":["305683287_Algorithmic_statistics_forty_years_later","275279719_Around_Kolmogorov_Complexity_Basic_Notions_and_Results","228568139_Generic_computability_Turing_degrees_and_asymptotic_density","316805467_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","311251179_Algorithmic_Statistics_Forty_Years_Later","252163589_Diagonally_non-recursive_functions_and_effective_Hausdorff_dimension","243769837_On_the_notion_of_a_random_sequence","242519306_Optimal_numberings_and_isoperimetric_problems_on_graphs","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","226889222_A_unified_approach_to_the_definition_of_random_sequences"]}
