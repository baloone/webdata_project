{"id":"327121444_Performance_analysis_of_fact-checking_organizations_and_initiatives_in_Europe_a_critical_overview_of_online_platforms_fighting_fake_news","abstract":"This study represents the first work integrating theory and practice from the field of fact-checking and combating fake news into a novel methodology for performance analysis of fact-checking organizations. It provides important insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of European fact-checking organizations. However, it is relevant for any fact-checking organization across the Globe. The methodology includes the development of a scheme of performance indicators and the definition of a taxonomy of fact-checking systems, supported by an existing conceptual framework. The practical part consists of piloting of the methodology into a set of implemented and working online platforms. The results from the study reveal huge space for improvements of the workflows and the functionality of fact-checkers and lead to the extraction of a set of recommendations in this regard.","authors":["Tanja Pavleska","Andrej Skolkay","Bissera Zankova","Nelson Costa Ribeiro"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: COMPACT - Social Media and Convergence"],"references":["339031969_INFORMATION_DISORDER_Toward_an_interdisciplinary_framework_for_research_and_policy_making_Information_Disorder_Toward_an_interdisciplinary_framework_for_research_and_policymaking","321381766_Fighting_fake_news_a_role_for_computational_social_science_in_the_fight_against_digital_misinformation","320237117_A_Field_Guide_to_Fake_News_A_Collection_of_Recipes_for_Those_Who_Love_to_Cook_with_Digital_Methods","319653313_Debunking_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Psychological_Efficacy_of_Messages_Countering_Misinformation","319254280_Trust_and_Distrust_in_Online_Fact-Checking_Services","304712412_Seizing_the_Digital","320821086_Related_Fact_Checks_a_tool_for_combating_fake_news","316712634_Social_Media_and_Fake_News_in_the_2016_Election","308565786_Deception_detection_for_news_Three_types_of_fakes","307907069_Automatic_deception_detection_Methods_for_finding_fake_news"]}
