{"id":"325851779_Beyond_the_Zagreb_indices","abstract":"The two Zagreb indices M1=∑vd(v)² and M2=∑uvd(u)d(v) are vertex-degree-based graph invariants that have been introduced in the 1970s and extensively studied ever since. In the last few years, a variety of modifications of M1 and M2 were put forward. The present survey of these modified Zagreb indices outlines their main mathematical properties, and provides an exhaustive bibliography.","authors":["Ivan Gutman","Emina Milovanović","Igor Milovanović"],"meta":["June 2018AKCE International Journal of Graphs and Combinatorics 17(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.akcej.2018.05.002"],"references":["348736463_Hyper-Zagreb_indices_of_graphs_and_its_applications","327149772_Vertex-weighted_Wiener_polynomials_for_composite_graphs","323253042_On_bounds_for_harmonic_topological_index","322853722_Zagreb_energy_and_Zagreb_Estrada_index_of_graphs","322853505_Inverse_problem_for_sigma_index","328975925_Extermal_properties_of_Zagreb_coindices_and_degree_distance_of_graphs","327687395_Solved_and_Unsolved_Problems_of_Structural_Chemistry","322853479_Some_inequalities_for_general_sum-connectivity_index","321025411_Extremal_trees_with_respect_to_the_first_and_second_reformulated_Zagreb_index","321012254_Graphs_with_smallest_forgotten_index"]}
