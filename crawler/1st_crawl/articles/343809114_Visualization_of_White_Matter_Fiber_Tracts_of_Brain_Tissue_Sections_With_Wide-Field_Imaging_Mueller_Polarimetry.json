{"id":"343809114_Visualization_of_White_Matter_Fiber_Tracts_of_Brain_Tissue_Sections_With_Wide-Field_Imaging_Mueller_Polarimetry","abstract":"Identification of white matter fiber tracts of the brain is crucial for delineating the tumor border during neurosurgery. A custom-built Mueller polarimeter was used in reflection configuration for the wide-field imaging of thick sections of fixed human brain and fresh calf brain. The maps of the azimuth of the fast optical axis of linear birefringent medium reconstructed from the experimental Mueller matrix images of the specimen by applying a non-linear data compression algorithm showed a strong correlation with the silver-stained sample histology image, which is the gold standard for ex-vivo brain fiber tract visualization. The polarimetric maps of fresh calf brain tissue demonstrated the same trends in the depolarization, the scalar retardance and the azimuth of the fast optical axis as seen in fixed human brain tissue. Thus, label-free imaging Mueller polarimetry shows promise as an efficient intra-operative modality for the visualization of healthy brain white matter fiber tracts, which could improve the accuracy of tumor border detection and, ultimately, patient outcomes.","authors":["Philippe Schucht","Hee Ryung Lee","Mohammed Hachem Mezouar","Ekkehard Hewer"],"meta":["August 2020IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMI.2020.3018439"],"references":["342723335_Evaluating_b-amyloidosis_Progression_in_Alzheimer's_Disease_with_Mueller_Polarimetry","337410794_Differential_Mueller_matrix_imaging_of_partially_depolarizing_optically_anisotropic_biological_tissues","334682056_Digital_histology_with_Mueller_microscopy_how_to_mitigate_an_impact_of_tissue_cut_thickness_fluctuations","332161544_Cross-Polarization_Optical_Coherence_Tomography_for_Brain_Tumor_Imaging","331631509_Optical_phantoms_for_biomedical_polarimetry_a_review","341309119_Polarimetric_imaging_in_backscattering_for_the_structural_characterization_of_strongly_scattering_birefringent_fibrous_media","334000914_Innovative_integrated_numerical-experimental_method_for_high-performance_multispectral_Mueller_polarimeters_based_on_ferroelectric_liquid_crystals","331505230_Innovative_and_high-performance_instrumentation_for_biomedical_Mueller_polarimetric_imaging_in_vivo","329440995_Multi-spectral_Mueller_Matrix_Imaging_Polarimetry_for_Studies_of_Human_Tissues","329440690_Mueller_microscopy_of_anisotropic_scattering_media_theory_and_experiments"]}
