{"id":"227445489_A_Diffusion_Approximation_for_an_MGm_Queue_with_Group_Arrivals","abstract":"This paper deals with the M/G/m queueing system with group arrivals. Using a diffusion approximation, we present approximate formulae for the steady-state distribution of the number of customers in the system. From this distribution, approximate formulae for some queueing characteristics such as the delay probability and the mean queue length are derived. In order to check the accuracy of the approximate formulae, they are numerically tested on some special cases.","authors":["Toshikazu Kimura","Tadashi Ohsone"],"meta":["March 1984Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan 30(3):381-388","DOI:10.1287/mnsc.30.3.381","SourceRePEc"],"references":[]}
