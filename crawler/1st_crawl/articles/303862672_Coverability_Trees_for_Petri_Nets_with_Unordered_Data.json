{"id":"303862672_Coverability_Trees_for_Petri_Nets_with_Unordered_Data","abstract":"We study an extension of classical Petri nets where tokens carry values from a countable data domain, that can be tested for equality upon firing transitions. These Unordered Data Petri Nets (UDPN) are well-structured and therefore allow generic decision procedures for several verification problems including coverability and boundedness.\nWe show how to construct a finite representation of the coverability set in terms of its ideal decomposition. This not only provides an alternative method to decide coverability and boundedness, but is also an important step towards deciding the reachability problem. This also allows to answer more precise questions about the reachability set, for instance whether there is a bound on the number of tokens on a given place (place boundedness), or if such a bound exists for the number of different data values carried by tokens (place width boundedness).\nWe provide matching Hyper-Ackermann bounds on the size of coverability trees and on the running time of the induced decision procedures.","authors":["Piotr Hofman","Sławomir Lasota","Ranko Lazić","Jérôme Leroux"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49630-5_26","Conference: International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures","Project: Data Petri Nets"],"references":["224251030_Ackermannian_and_Primitive-Recursive_Bounds_with_Dickson's_Lemma","220444377_Nets_with_Tokens_Which_Carry_Data","220443198_Accelerations_for_the_Coverability_Set_of_Petri_Nets_with_Names","220151596_Well-structured_transition_systems_everywhere","23992908_Forward_analysis_for_WSTS_Part_I_Completions","350671895_Forward_Analysis_for_WSTS_Part_II_Complete_WSTS","314133436_Ordinal_Recursive_Complexity_of_Unordered_Data_Nets","281660521_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_WQO_Theory","273158125_Reachability_in_Vector_Addition_Systems_Demystified","268501754_Parallel_program_schemata","268066759_Automata_theory_in_nominal_sets","261055517_The_Ordinal-Recursive_Complexity_of_Timed-Arc_Petri_Nets_Data_Nets_and_Other_Enriched_Nets","260167086_The_Power_of_Well-Structured_Systems","259367945_Complexity_Hierarchies_Beyond_Elementary","256555232_A_structure_to_decide_reachability_in_Petri_nets","243769060_Decidability_of_reachability_in_vector_addition_systems","239574720_The_reachability_problem_requires_exponential_space","228947441_Accelerations_for_the_coverability_set_of_Petri_nets_with_names","222850848_Parallel_program_schemata","222684215_Algorithmic_Analysis_of_Programs_with_Well_Quasi-ordered_Domains","222537668_Well-structured_transition_systems_everywhere","222371645_Rackoff_C_The_covering_and_boundedness_problems_for_vector_addition_systems_Theoret_Comp_Sci_6_223-231","221591746_An_Algorithm_for_the_General_Petri_Net_Reachability_Problem","221591404_Exponential_Space_Complete_Problems_for_Petri_Nets_and_Commutative_Semigroups_Preliminary_Report","221591022_Decidability_of_Reachability_in_Vector_Addition_Systems_Preliminary_Version","220975715_Revisiting_Ackermann-Hardness_for_Lossy_Counter_Machines_and_Reset_Petri_Nets","220975424_Model_Checking_Coverability_Graphs_of_Vector_Addition_Systems","220618011_An_Algorithm_for_the_General_Petri_Net_Reachability_Problem","220247007_A_Well-Structured_Framework_for_Analysing_Petri_Nets_Extensions","220150889_Decidability_and_complexity_of_Petri_nets_with_unordered_data","47631738_On_selective_unboundedness_of_VASS"]}
