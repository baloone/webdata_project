{"id":"289807665_Concept_Maps_and_Patterns_for_Designing_Learning_Scenarios_Based_on_Digital-Ink_Technologies","abstract":"The research on educational technologies is continuously growing and their application demands an additional effort to instructors. The current work describes the use of concept maps and patterns to provide a better support to instructors in the design of their technology-enhanced learning scenarios. The combination of both representation mechanisms has been applied in a Higher Education context based on the use of digital-ink technologies. The obtained outcomes reveal, first, the contribution of concept maps to represent technology-enhanced learning scenarios from a generic point of view and second, the feasible design of specific learning scenarios based on digital-ink patterns which have been generated from previous concept maps.","authors":["Félix Buendía-García","J.-V.
