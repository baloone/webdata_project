{"id":"338819612_AI_and_Arts_-_A_Workshop_to_Unify_Arts_and_Science","abstract":"Throughout the last years, new methods in artificial intelligence have revolutionized several scientific fields. These developments affect arts twofold. On the one hand, artists discover machine learning as a new tool. On the other hand, researchers apply the new techniques to the creative work of artists to better analyze and understand it. The workshop AI and Arts brings these two perspectives together and starts a dialog between artists and researchers. It was a satellite workshop of the KI 2019 conference in September 2019 in Kassel, Germany. The conference is the 42nd edition of the German Conference on artificial intelligence organized in cooperation with the AI Chapter of the German Society for Computer Science (GI-FBKI).","authors":["Martin Skrodzki"],"meta":["December 2019","Project: Mathematical Art and Digital Humanities"],"references":[]}
