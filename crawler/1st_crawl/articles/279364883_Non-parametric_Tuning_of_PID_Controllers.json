{"id":"279364883_Non-parametric_Tuning_of_PID_Controllers","abstract":"In Chap. 2, further to Introduction, two approaches in controller tuning, parametric and non-parametric, are considered. Non-parametric methods of tuning based on the continuous cycling principle are considered in this chapter in detail. The chapter starts with the Ziegler-Nichols closed-loop tuning method and progresses to the available methods of tuning, which involve the possibility of excitation of test oscillations at frequencies corresponding to phase lags of the process other than −180∘. The necessity of such functionality is supported by examples provided.","authors":["Igor Boiko"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4471-4465-6_2","In book: Non-parametric Tuning of PID Controllers (pp.9-23)","Project: PID Tuning"],"references":["233364147_Parameter_identification_via_modified_twisting_algorithm","3031835_Analysis_of_Second-Order_Sliding-Mode_Algorithms_in_the_Frequency_Domain","316627975_Control_System_Design_Guide","309173770_Optimum_settings_for_automatic_controllers","306107211_Process_Dynamics_Modeling_and_Control","288070408_PID_control_New_identification_and_design_methods","285382053_Phase-Locked_Loop_Methods_and_PID_Control","285246266_Phase-Locked_Loop_Methods","268860389_Practical_PID_control","268518665_Process_Control_-_Theory_and_Applications","266997529_Discontinuous_Control_Systems_Frequency-Domain_Analysis_and_Design","260360169_PID_controllers_Theory_Design_and_Tuning","245223803_Advances_in_PID_Control","239019419_Feedback_Controllers_for_the_Process_Industries","227918481_Enhanced_Automatic_Tuning_Procedure_for_Process_Control_of_PI_PID_Controllers","227727168_Generating_oscillations_in_inertia_wheel_pendulum_via_two-relay_controller","224384605_Generating_Self-Excited_Oscillations_via_Two-Relay_Controller","222735820_Automatic_Tuning_of_Simple_Regulators_With_Specifications_on_Phase_and_Amplitude_Margins","222644367_Oscillations_and_transfer_properties_of_relay_servo_systems_-_The_locus_of_a_perturbed_relay_system_approach","48486759_Process_Control_Designing_Processes_and_Control_Systems_for_Dynamic_Performance_New_York_McGraw-Hill","31746328_Process_Control_Designing_Processes_and_Control_Systems_for_Dynamic_Perfomance_TE_Marlin","31738735_Process_Control_Modeling_Design_and_Simulation_BW_Bequette","3811058_A_New_Non-_Parametric_Identification_Procedure_for_Online_Controller_Tuning","2742858_A_Two-Channel_Relay_for_Autotuning"]}
