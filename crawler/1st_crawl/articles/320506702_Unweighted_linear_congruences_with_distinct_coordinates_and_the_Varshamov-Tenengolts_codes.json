{"id":"320506702_Unweighted_linear_congruences_with_distinct_coordinates_and_the_Varshamov-Tenengolts_codes","abstract":"In this paper, we first give explicit formulas for the number of solutions of unweighted linear congruences with distinct coordinates. Our main tools are properties of Ramanujan sums and of the discrete Fourier transform of arithmetic functions. Then, as an application, we derive an explicit formula for the number of codewords in the Varshamov–Tenengolts code (Formula presented.) with Hamming weight k, that is, with exactly k 1’s. The Varshamov–Tenengolts codes are an important class of codes that are capable of correcting asymmetric errors on a Z-channel. As another application, we derive Ginzburg’s formula for the number of codewords in (Formula presented.), that is, (Formula presented.). We even go further and discuss connections to several other combinatorial problems, some of which have appeared in seemingly unrelated contexts. This provides a general framework and gives new insight into all these problems which might lead to further work.","authors":["Khodakhast Bibak","Bruce M.
