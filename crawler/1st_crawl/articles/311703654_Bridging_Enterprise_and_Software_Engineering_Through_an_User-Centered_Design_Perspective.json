{"id":"311703654_Bridging_Enterprise_and_Software_Engineering_Through_an_User-Centered_Design_Perspective","abstract":"The development of Web-based Information Systems is crucial in the quest to maintain and develop the enterprise competiveness. However, capturing requirements from Business Processes (BP) is still an issue, as existing methods mostly focus, or on human aspects and the user interface, or on business concerns as rules and workflow coordination, and therefore do not specify all the Software Architectural components which are relevant for software development. We present the Goals Approach, which analyzes BPs and User Tasks and details them in the process of methodically designing and structuring the User Interface, the Business Logic and the Database of the Information System given a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. In this paper we focus on how to obtain the Goals business model of requirements based on the DEMO method. The approach can be used for in-house software development, and the method is straightforward fitting Small and Medium Enterprises agility needs.","authors":["Pedro Valente","Thiago Rocha Silva","Marco Winckler","Nuno Jardim Nunes"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-48743-4_28","Conference: International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering","Project: Enterprise and Software Implementation Traceability"],"references":["282939251_Improving_Software_Design_Decisions_towards_Enhanced_Return_of_Investment","244473739_Object_Modeling_for_User-Centered_Development_and_User_Interface_Design_The_Wisdom_Approach","230773292_TRANSFORMING_OBJECT_ORIENTED_DATA_MODEL_TO_RELATIONAL_DATA_MODEL","230771422_TRANSFORMING_OBJECT_ORIENTED_DATA_MODEL_TO_RELATIONAL_DATA_MODEL","230661791_Business_Process_Improvement_Framework_and_Representational_Support","228090874_Model-based_design_and_evaluation_of_interactive_applications","284194614_Usability_Aspects_of_the_Inside-in_Approach_for_Ancillary_Search_Tasks_on_the_Web","237106818_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_User_Guide","227186796_Human_Activity_Modeling_Toward_A_Pragmatic_Integration_of_Activity_Theory_and_Usage-Centered_Design","222648296_Factors_affecting_duration_and_effort_estimation_errors_in_software_development_projects"]}
