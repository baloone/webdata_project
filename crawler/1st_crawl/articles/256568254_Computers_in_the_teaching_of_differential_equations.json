{"id":"256568254_Computers_in_the_teaching_of_differential_equations","abstract":"The purposes, methodology and contents of a computer oriented first course in differential equations are described. The course is open to those in the life sciences as well as to mathematics and physical science majors and presumes neither previous computer experience nor more than a minimal background in calculus. One of the features of the course is the parallel treatment given to analytic and numeric solution approaches. The latter uses a flowchart language as its teaching medium with computer library programs being available for extensive numerical work.","authors":["C.W.
