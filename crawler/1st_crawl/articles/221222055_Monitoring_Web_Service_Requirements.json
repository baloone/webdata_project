{"id":"221222055_Monitoring_Web_Service_Requirements","abstract":"Businesses that rely on Web services are vulnerable to the problems of those Web services. Service contracts and warranties can provide some assurances. However, they provide traditional recourse, rather than timely alerts of impending problems. While electronic commerce has increased the speed of online transactions, the technology of monitoring online transactions has lagged behind. To address the problem of Web service monitoring, we integrated methods of requirements analysis and software execution monitoring. The resulting system assists analysts in the development of Web service requirements monitors. We presented here builds on prior research by: (1) building on a goal-based method for obstacle discovery, (2) illustrating the derivation of assigned monitors from obstacles, and (3) automatically deriving Web service monitors from high-level requirements descriptions. The framework, and tool, provides an important contribution by demonstrating how distributed concurrent Web service transactions can be monitored at the requirements level.","authors":["William N.
