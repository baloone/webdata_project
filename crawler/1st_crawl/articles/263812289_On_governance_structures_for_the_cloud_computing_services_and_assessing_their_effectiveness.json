{"id":"263812289_On_governance_structures_for_the_cloud_computing_services_and_assessing_their_effectiveness","abstract":"This research suggests information technology (IT) governance structures to manage the cloud computing services. The interest in acquiring IT resources as a utility from the cloud computing environment is gaining momentum. The cloud computing services present organizations with opportunities to manage their IT expenditure on an ongoing basis, and access to modern IT resources to innovate and manage their continuity. However, the cloud computing services are no silver bullet. Organizations would need to have appropriate governance structures and policies in place to manage the cloud computing services. The subsequent decisions from these governance structures will ensure the effective management of the cloud computing services. This management will facilitate a better fit of the cloud computing services into organizations' existing processes to achieve the business (process-level) and the financial (firm-level) objectives. Using a triangulation approach, we suggest four governance structures for managing the cloud computing services. These structures are a chief cloud officer, a cloud management committee, a cloud service facilitation centre, and a cloud relationship centre. We also propose that these governance structures would relate directly to organizations' cloud computing services-related business objectives, and indirectly to cloud computing services-related financial objectives. Perceptive field survey data from actual and prospective cloud computing service adopters suggest that the suggested governance structures would contribute directly to cloud computing-related business objectives and indirectly to cloud computing-related financial objectives.","authors":["Acklesh Prasad","Peter Green","Jon Heales"],"meta":["July 2014International Journal of Accounting Information Systems 15(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.accinf.2014.05.005"],"references":["267027138_Analysis_of_Dissatisfiers_That_Inhibit_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_Across_Multiple_Customer_Segments","256070836_The_Role_of_the_Chief_Technology_Officer","243775502_Strategic_Assets_and_Organizational_Rent","239928358_The_Relational_View_Cooperative_Strategy_and_Sources_of_Interorganizational_Competitive_Advantage","234021985_Social_Structure_and_Competition_in_Interfirm_Networks_The_Paradox_of_Embeddedness","232989464_Chief_technology_officer_roles_and_performance","228215745_The_Chief_Technology_Officer","224367196_Toward_a_Unified_Ontology_of_Cloud_Computing","224202015_Security_and_Privacy_Challenges_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments","220591798_The_Effects_of_MIS_Steering_Committees_on_Information_Technology_Management_Sophistication","220591373_A_Process-Oriented_Perspective_on_the_Alignment_of_Information_Technology_and_Business_Strategy","220535189_A_Relational_View_of_Information_Seeking_and_Learning_in_Social_Networks","220422375_A_View_of_Cloud_Computing","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","31025597_Modes_of_Network_Governance_Structure_Management_and_Effectiveness","281604001_Governance_for_Protecting_Information_in_the_Cloud","281298091_Cloud_Computing_A_Practical_Framework_for_Managing_Cloud_Computing_Risk-Part_II","273932818_Preferential_Linkage_and_Network_Evolution_A_Conceptual_Model_and_Empirical_Test_in_the_US_Video_Game_Sector","269639153_Governance_Framework_for_Cloud_Computing","264693239_Effective_Interim_Collaboration_How_Firms_Minimize_Transaction_Costs_and_Maximise_Transaction_Value","262388962_Cloud_computing_for_education_A_new_dawn","262141101_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_5th_Ed","257590211_On_IT_governance_structures_and_their_effectiveness_in_collaborative_organizational_structures","257158067_Cost_effectiveness_of_commercial_computing_clouds","243669767_Information_Technology_and_Sustained_Competitive_Advantage_A_Resource-Based_Analysis","240976860_Examining_Performance_Measurement_from_an_Integrated_Perspective","234021491_Agency_Theory_An_Assessment_and_Review","233378501_Assessing_the_Business_Value_of_Information_Technology_in_Global_Wholesale_Banking_The_Case_of_Trade_Services","232457410_Cross-National_Alliances_and_Interorganizational_Learning","228785102_The_Role_of_Trustworthiness_in_Reducing_Transaction_Costs_and_Improving_Performance_Empirical_Evidence_from_the_United_States_Japan_and_Korea","227737019_A_Resource_View_of_the_Firm","227089526_Cloud_Computing_-_Outsourcing_20_or_a_new_Business_Model_for_IT_Provisioning","222526730_Identification_of_a_company's_suitability_for_the_adoption_of_cloud_computing_and_modelling_its_corresponding_Return_on_Investment","222262837_The_transition_from_product_to_service_in_business_markets_An_agenda_for_academic_inquiry","222042061_A_capabilities-based_approach_to_obtaining_a_deeper_understanding_of_information_technology_governance_effectiveness_Evidence_from_IT_steering_committees","221599275_Towards_a_Deeper_Understanding_of_Information_Technology_Governance_Effectiveness_A_Capabilities-Based_Approach","221177320_Cloud_Computing_-_The_Business_Perspective","220393027_Influencing_the_effectiveness_of_IT_governance_practices_through_steering_committees_and_communication_policies","220260329_Managing_Telecommunications_by_Steering_Committee","220260162_Review_Information_Technology_and_Organizational_Performance_An_Integrative_Model_of_IT_Business_Value","220260043_Information_Technology_and_Sustained_Competitive_Advantage_A_Reourse-Based_Analysis","220197084_Cloud_computing_-_The_business_perspective","220079770_The_Emergence_of_Interpretivism_in_IS_Research","220079599_Development_of_an_Instrument_Ot_Mesure_the_Perceptions_of_Adopting_an_Information_Technology_Innovation","215915373_Firm_Resource_and_Sustained_Competitive_Advantage","200465328_Case_Study_Research_Design_Methods","46489094_Organizational_context_and_face-to-face_interaction_Influences_on_the_development_of_trust_and_collaborative_behaviors_in_computer-mediated_groups"]}
