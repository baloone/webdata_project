{"id":"301755220_Construction_independent_spanning_trees_on_locally_twisted_cubes_in_parallel","abstract":"Let (Formula presented.) be the n-dimensional locally twisted cube. Hsieh and Tu (Theor Comput Sci 410(8–10):926–932, 2009) proposed an algorithm to construct n edge-disjoint spanning trees rooted at a particular vertex 0 in (Formula presented.). Later on, Lin et al. (Inf Process Lett 110(10):414–419, 2010) proved that Hsieh and Tu’s spanning trees are indeed independent spanning trees (ISTs for short), i.e., all spanning trees are rooted at the same vertex r and for any other vertex (Formula presented.), the paths from v to r in any two trees are internally vertex-disjoint. Shortly afterwards, Liu et al. (Theor Comput Sci 412(22):2237–2252, 2011) pointed out that (Formula presented.) fails to be vertex-transitive for (Formula presented.) and proposed an algorithm for constructing n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in (Formula presented.). Although this algorithm can simultaneously construct n ISTs, it is hard to be parallelized for the construction of each spanning tree. In this paper, from a modification of Hsieh and Tu’s algorithm, we present a fully parallelized scheme to construct n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in (Formula presented.) in (Formula presented.) time using (Formula presented.) vertices of (Formula presented.) as processors.","authors":["Yu-Huei Chang","Jinn-Shyong Yang","Sun-Yuan Hsieh","Jou-ming Chang"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 33(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-016-0018-8"],"references":["313755300_A_linear-time_algorithm_to_find_independent_spanning_trees_in_maximal_planar_graphs","282906972_Parallel_Construction_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Enhanced_Hypercubes","276834793_A_fully_parallelized_scheme_of_constructing_independent_spanning_trees_on_Mobius_cubes","275164336_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Cartesian_Product_of_Hybrid_Graphs","274171451_Constructive_Algorithm_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Mobius_Cubes","273392480_Dimensional-Permutation-Based_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Bijective_Connection_Networks","264719533_Three_tree-paths","263775031_A_comment_on_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","257666493_Parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_and_an_application_in_diagnosis_on_Mobius_cubes","257252425_Dimension-adjacent_trees_and_parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_on_crossed_cubes","228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","257252088_An_efficient_parallel_construction_of_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_on_hypercubes","257145081_An_algorithm_to_construct_independent_spanning_trees_on_parity_cubes","256721175_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","242790259_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_GcdmdGcdmd_with_d2d2"]}
