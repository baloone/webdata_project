{"id":"312462527_Nonrepetitive_edge-colorings_of_trees","abstract":"A repetition is a sequence of symbols in which the first half is the same as the second half. An edge-coloring of a graph is repetition-free or nonrepetitive if there is no path with a color pattern that is a repetition. The minimum number of colors so that a graph has a nonrepetitive edge-coloring is called its Thue edge-chromatic number. We improve on the best known general upper bound of $4\\Delta-4$ for the Thue edge-chromatic number of trees of maximum degree $\\Delta$ due to Alon, Grytczuk, Ha{\\l}uszczak and Riordan (2002) by providing a simple nonrepetitive edge-coloring with $3\\Delta-2$ colors.","authors":["A.
