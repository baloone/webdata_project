{"id":"343269435_Does_not_compute_challenges_and_solutions_in_managing_computable_biomedical_knowledge","abstract":"Computers can potentially play a key role in resolving knowledge mobilisation bottlenecks in health and care through decision support at the point of care based on computable biomedical knowledge (CBK). But the management of CBK comes with a range of significant computer science challenges. Some of these have been suitably addressed through the development of CBK methods and tools, while others require further research and development. We review the main challenges associated with creating, reasoning with and sharing CBK, and describe current state-of-the-art solutions as well as outstanding issues. We argue that a radical approach, in which all evidence generation is suitable for computation at the outset, is ultimately needed to take full advantage of CBK.","authors":["David Wong","Niels Peek"],"meta":["July 2020BMJ Health & Care Informatics 27(2):e100123","DOI:10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100123"],"references":["295086076_SMART_on_FHIR_A_standards-based_interoperable_apps_platform_for_electronic_health_records","281359301_The_protege_project","221188311_Why_Linked_Data_is_Not_Enough_for_Scientists","51921221_GEM_at_10_A_Decade's_Experience_with_the_Guideline_Elements_Model","51156863_Standards_for_Scalable_Clinical_Decision_Support_Need_Current_and_Emerging_Standards_Gaps_and_Proposal_for_Progress","46579805_Seventy-Five_Trials_and_Eleven_Systematic_Reviews_a_Day_How_Will_We_Ever_Keep_Up","319395097_FaCT_Description_Logic_Reasoner_System_Description","221840297_The_Arden_Syntax_standard_for_clinical_decision_support_Experiences_and_directions","46411781_Why_Linked_Data_is_Not_Enough_for_Scientists","24307065_A_parallel_guideline_development_and_formalization_strategy_to_improve_the_quality_of_clinical_practice_guidelines"]}
