{"id":"326685821_Finite-time_sliding_mode_stabilization_using_dirty_differentiation_and_disturbance_compensation","abstract":"Novel robust finite‐time stabilizing algorithms are developed side by side for the state and output feedback designs. Being initially developed for a nonlinear cascade second‐order system, these algorithms are straightforwardly extendible to electromechanical systems of relative degree two. The proposed synthesis is based on the disturbance compensation, relying on the dirty differentiation and sliding mode approach, and it is applicable to a wider class of disturbances than that addressed in the literature. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the resulting synthesis procedure and support analytical results.","authors":["Igor Furtat","Y. Orlov","A.
