{"id":"266319594_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_for_nonconvex_feasibility_problems","abstract":"We adapt the Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting method to solve nonconvex\nfeasibility problems by studying this method for a class of nonconvex\noptimization problem. While the convergence properties of the method for convex\nproblems have been well studied, far less is known in the nonconvex setting. In\nthis paper, for the direct adaptation of the method to minimize the sum of a\nproper closed function $g$ and a smooth function $f$ with a Lipschitz\ncontinuous gradient, we show that if the step-size parameter is smaller than a\ncomputable threshold and the sequence generated has a cluster point, then it\ngives a stationary point of the optimization problem. Convergence of the whole\nsequence and a local convergence rate are also established under the additional\nassumption that $f$ and $g$ are semi-algebraic. We then apply our nonconvex DR\nsplitting method to finding a point in the intersection of a closed convex set\n$C$ and a general closed set $D$ by minimizing the square distance to $C$\nsubject to $D$. We show that if either set is bounded and the step-size\nparameter is smaller than a computable threshold, then the sequence generated\nfrom the DR splitting method is actually bounded. Consequently, the sequence\ngenerated will have cluster points that are stationary for an optimization\nproblem, and the whole sequence is convergent under an additional assumption\nthat $C$ and $D$ are semi-algebraic. We achieve these results based on a new\nmerit function constructed particularly for the DR splitting method. Our\npreliminary numerical results indicate that the DR splitting method usually\noutperforms the alternating projection method in finding a sparse solution of a\nlinear system, in terms of both the solution quality and the number of\niterations taken.","authors":["G.
