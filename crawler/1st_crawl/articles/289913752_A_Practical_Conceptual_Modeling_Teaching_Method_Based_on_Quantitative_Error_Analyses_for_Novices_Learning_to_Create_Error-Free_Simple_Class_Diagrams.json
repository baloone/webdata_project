{"id":"289913752_A_Practical_Conceptual_Modeling_Teaching_Method_Based_on_Quantitative_Error_Analyses_for_Novices_Learning_to_Create_Error-Free_Simple_Class_Diagrams","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to explore educational methods for conceptual modeling for novices. In this research, the subjects are high school students and freshmen in university enrolled in various programs. Typical errors in class diagrams made by these types of novice learners are not easily detected. Therefore, we collected and analyzed some common errors, then developed appropriate teaching methods for novices based on these errors. In this paper, we show the results of our analyses of class diagram errors. After that we discuss basic methods to teach conceptual modeling to novices effectively.","authors":["Mizue Kayama","Shinpei Ogata","Kento Masymoto","Masami Hashimoto"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.131","Project: MDD in ED"],"references":["228544624_Thinking_in_Object_Structures_Teaching_Modelling_in_Secondary_Schools","220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","220420544_Assisting_novice_analysts_in_developing_quality_conceptual_models_with_UML","260409798_An_evaluation_of_novice_end-user_computing_performance_Data_modeling_query_writing_and_comprehension"]}
