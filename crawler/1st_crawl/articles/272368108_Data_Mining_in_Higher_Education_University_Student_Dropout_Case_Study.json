{"id":"272368108_Data_Mining_in_Higher_Education_University_Student_Dropout_Case_Study","abstract":"In this paper, we apply different data mining approaches for the purpose of examining and predicting\nstudentsâ€™ dropouts through their university programs. For the subject of the study we select a total of 1290\nrecords of computer science students Graduated from ALAQSA University between 2005 and 2011. The\ncollected data included student study history and transcript for courses taught in the first two years of\ncomputer science major in addition to student GPA , high school average , and class label of (yes ,No) to\nindicate whether the student graduated from the chosen major or not. In order to classify and predict\ndropout students, different classifiers have been trained on our data sets including Decision Tree (DT),\nNaive Bayes (NB). These methods were tested using 10-fold cross validation. The accuracy of DT, and NlB\nclassifiers were 98.14% and 96.86% respectively. The study also includes discovering hidden relationships\nbetween student dropout status and enrolment persistence by mining a frequent cases using FP-growth\nalgorithm.","authors":["Ghadeer S.
