{"id":"331236389_A_Neuromorphic_Silicon_Photonics_Nonlinear_Equalizer_For_Optical_Communications_With_Intensity_Modulation_and_Direct_Detection","abstract":"We present the design and numerical study of a nonlinear equalizer for optical communications based on silicon photonics and reservoir computing. The proposed equalizer leverages the optical information processing capabilities of integrated photonic reservoirs to combat distortions both in metro links of a few 100km and in high-speed short-reach Intensity-Modulation-Direct-Detection links. We show nonlinear compensation in unrepeated metro links of up to 200km that outperform electrical FFE based equalizers, and ultimately any linear compensation device. For a high-speed short-reach 40Gb/s link based on a Distributed Feedback Laser (DFB) and an Electroabsorptive Modulator (EAM), and considering an HD-FEC limit of \n$0.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ \n, we can increase the reach by almost 10km. Our equalizer is compact (only 16 nodes) and operates in the optical domain without the need for complex electronic DSP, meaning its performance is not bandwidth constrained. The approach is therefore a viable candidate even for equalization techniques far beyond 100G optical communication links.","authors":["Andrew Katumba","Xin Yin","J.
