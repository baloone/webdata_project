{"id":"344473437_On_the_Betti_numbers_of_sign_conditions","abstract":"Let R \\mathrm {R} be a real closed field and let Q {\\mathcal Q} and P {\\mathcal P} be finite subsets of R [ X 1 , … , X k ] \\mathrm {R}[X_1,\\ldots ,X_k] such that the set P {\\mathcal P} has s s elements, the algebraic set Z Z defined by ⋀ Q ∈ Q Q = 0 \\bigwedge _{Q \\in {\\mathcal Q}}Q=0 has dimension k ′ k’ and the elements of Q {\\mathcal Q} and P {\\mathcal P} have degree at most d d . For each 0 ≤ i ≤ k ′ , 0 \\leq i \\leq k’, we denote the sum of the i i -th Betti numbers over the realizations of all sign conditions of P {\\mathcal P} on Z Z by b i ( P , Q ) b_i({\\mathcal P},{\\mathcal Q}) . We prove that \\[ b i ( P , Q ) ≤ ∑ j = 0 k ′ − i ( s j ) 4 j d ( 2 d − 1 ) k − 1 . b_i({\\mathcal P},{\\mathcal Q}) \\le \\sum _{j=0}^{k’ - i} {s \\choose j} 4^{j} d(2d-1)^{k-1}. \\] This generalizes to all the higher Betti numbers the bound ( s k ′ ) O ( d ) k {s \\choose k’}O(d)^k on b 0 ( P , Q ) b_0({\\mathcal P},{\\mathcal Q}) . We also prove, using similar methods, that the sum of the Betti numbers of the intersection of Z Z with a closed semi-algebraic set, defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula without negations with atoms of the form P ≥ 0 P \\geq 0 or P ≤ 0 P\\leq 0 for P ∈ P P\\in {\\mathcal P} , is bounded by \\[ ∑ i = 0 k ′ ∑ j = 0 k ′ − i ( s j ) 6 j d ( 2 d − 1 ) k − 1 , \\sum _{i = 0}^{k’}\\sum _{j = 0}^{k’ - i} {s \\choose j} 6^{j} d(2d-1)^{k-1}, \\] making the bound s k ′ O ( d ) k s^{k’} O(d)^k more precise.","authors":["Saugata Basu","Richard Pollack","Marie-Françoise Roy"],"meta":["November 2004Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 133(4):965-974","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9939-04-07629-4"],"references":["321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","275027621_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","266003854_Sur_l'homologie_des_varietes_algebriques_reelles","247029122_On_the_Betti_Numbers_of_Real_Varieties","243787644_Semi-Algebraic_Local-Triviality_in_Semi-Algebraic_Mappings","227309129_Different_Bounds_on_the_Different_Betti_Numbers_of_Semi-Algebraic_Sets","227280719_On_Bounding_the_Betti_Numbers_and_Computing_the_Euler_Characteristic_of_Semi-Algebraic_Sets","2342978_On_the_Number_of_Cells_Defined_by_a_Family_of_Polynomials_on_a_Variety"]}
