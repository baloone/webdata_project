{"id":"282639105_Nonlinear_Spectral_Analysis_via_One-Homogeneous_Functionals_Overview_and_Future_Prospects","abstract":"We present in this paper the motivation and theory of nonlinear spectral\nrepresentations, based on convex regularizing functionals. Some comparisons and\nanalogies are drawn to the fields of signal processing, harmonic analysis and\nsparse representations. The basic approach, main results and initial\napplications are shown. A discussion of open problems and future directions\nconcludes this work.","authors":["Guy Gilboa","Michael Moeller","Martin Burger"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 56(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0665-5","SourcearXiv","Project: Nonlinear Spectral Decomposition"],"references":["290527631_Spectral_Decompositions_Using_One-Homogeneous_Functionals","284097243_Separation_Surfaces_in_the_Spectral_TV_Domain_for_Texture_Decomposition","280772875_Collaborative_Total_Variation_A_General_Framework_for_Vectorial_TV_Models","313876742_Proximiteet_dualite_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","312823053_Multiscale_Texture_Orientation_Analysis_Using_Spectral_Total-Variation_Decomposition","300408540_Learning_Nonlinear_Spectral_Filters_for_Color_Image_Reconstruction","295236032_A_Spectral_Approach_to_Total_Variation","282288327_Fundamentals_of_Non-Local_Total_Variation_Spectral_Theory","280172665_A_Total_Variation_Spectral_Framework_for_Scale_and_Texture_Analysis","273788292_Spectral_Representations_of_One-Homogeneous_Functionals","278282637_An_algorithm_for_total_variation_minimization_and_applications","277389125_A_Fast_Spectral_Method_for_Active_3D_Shape_Reconstruction","269633959_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1-egularized_problems","266551628_Mathematical_problems_in_image_processing_Partial_differential_equations_and_the_calculus_of_variations_Foreword_by_Olivier_Faugeras_2nd_ed"]}
