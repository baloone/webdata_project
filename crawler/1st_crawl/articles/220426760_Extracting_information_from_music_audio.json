{"id":"220426760_Extracting_information_from_music_audio","abstract":"The kinds of information available in the music signal, the problems faced in extracting information from the music audio, and the solution found for such a problem are discussed. It is found that the information carried by music occurs at multiple levels or timescale each useful to automatic analysis systems for a variety of purposes. Audio researchers have made considerable progress in the automatic extraction of musical attributes at several scales, considering the range of information present in a music audio signal. LabROSA has developed a browser that allows exploration by individual users of any large music collection by displaying pieces in a neighborhood of similarity around a selection. Progress in this field is a testament to the importance of music audio and to the value of automatic information extraction from these signals.","authors":["Daniel P. W.
