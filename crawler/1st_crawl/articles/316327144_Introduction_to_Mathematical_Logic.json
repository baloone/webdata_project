{"id":"316327144_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic","abstract":"Retaining all the key features of the previous editions, Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Fifth Edition explores the principal topics of mathematical logic. It covers propositional logic, first-order logic, first-order number theory, axiomatic set theory, and the theory of computability. The text also discusses the major results of Gdel, Church, Kleene, Rosser, and Turing.New to the Fifth Edition A new section covering basic ideas and results about nonstandard models of number theoryA second appendix that introduces modal propositional logicAn expanded bibliography Additional exercises and selected answers This long-established text continues to expose students to natural proofs and set-theoretic methods. Only requiring some experience in abstract mathematical thinking, it offers enough material for either a one- or two-semester course on mathematical logic.","authors":["Elliott Mendelson"],"meta":["January 1987","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-7288-6","ISBN: 978-1-4615-7290-9"],"references":[]}
