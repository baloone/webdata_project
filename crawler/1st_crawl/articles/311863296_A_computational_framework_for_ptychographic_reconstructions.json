{"id":"311863296_A_computational_framework_for_ptychographic_reconstructions","abstract":"Ptychography is now a well-established X-ray microscopy tool for synchrotron end-stations equipped with a scanning stage and a pixelated detector. Ptychographic phasing algorithms use information from coherent diffraction to deliver quantitative images of the specimen at a resolution higher than the scanning resolution. These algorithms have traditionally been implemented in software on a per-instrument basis in various degrees of user-friendliness and sophistication. Here, we present Ptypy, a ptychography software written with the intention to serve as a framework across the diverse sets of available instruments and usage cases. A distinctive feature of the software is its formalism, which provides a convenient abstraction of the physical model, thus allowing for concise algorithmic implementations and portability across set-up geometries. We give an overview of the supported usage cases, explain the abstraction layer and design principles, and provide a step-by-step guide describing how an algorithm may be realized in a concise and readable manner. The software capabilities are illustrated with reconstructions from visible light and X-ray data.","authors":["Bj√∂rn Enders","P.
