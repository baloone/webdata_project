{"id":"268659597_Universal_Point_Subsets_for_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"A set S of k points in the plane is a universal point subset for a class \\({\\mathcal G}\\) of planar graphs if every graph belonging to \\({\\mathcal G}\\) admits a planar straight-line drawing such that k of its vertices are represented by the points of S. In this paper we study the following main problem: For a given class of graphs, what is the maximum k such that there exists a universal point subset of size k? We provide a [\\({\\sqrt{n} \\;}\\)] lower bound on k for the class of planar graphs with n vertices. In addition, we consider the value \\(F(n, {\\mathcal G})\\) such that every set of \\(F(n, {\\mathcal G})\\) points in general position is a universal subset for all graphs with n vertices belonging to the family \\({\\mathcal G}\\), and we establish upper and lower bounds for \\(F(n, {\\mathcal G})\\) for different families of planar graphs, including 4-connected planar graphs and nested-triangles graphs.","authors":["Patrizio Angelini","Carla Binucci","William Evans","Ferran Hurtado"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35261-4_45","Conference: International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation"],"references":["243050634_Convex_Maps","225722154_A_Polynomial_Bound_for_Untangling_Geometric_Planar_Graphs","284660316_Embedding_planar_graphs_on_the_grid_In_Proc_1st_Annual_ACM-SIAM_Sympos_on_Discrete_Algorithms_SODA","279612851_E3341","251148536_Drawing_Planar_Graphs_on_Area","243549570_A_new_method_for_drawing_a_graph_given_the_cyclic_order_of_the_edges_at_each_vertex","243134315_A_1235_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_points_needed_to_draw_all_n-vertex_planar_graphs","242368584_Allowable_Sequences_and_Order_Types_in_Discrete_and_Computational_Geometry","238876434_Convex_Representations_of_Graphs","223673520_Interval_representations_of_planar_graphs","223468270_On_triconnected_and_cubic_plane_graphs_on_given_point_sets","222775023_On_embedding_an_outer-planar_graph_in_a_point_set","220779161_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_on_the_Grid","220639654_Planar_embeddability_of_the_vertices_of_a_graph_using_a_fixed_point_set_is_NP-hard","220533239_Axis-Aligned_Subdivisions_with_Low_Stabbing_Numbers","220442375_How_to_draw_a_planar_graph_on_a_grid","31150786_How_to_Draw_a_Graph","1734150_On_Collinear_Sets_in_Straight-Line_Drawings"]}
