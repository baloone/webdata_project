{"id":"3717370_Region_growing_and_region_merging_image_segmentation","abstract":"Image segmentation is an important first task of any image\nanalysis process. This paper presents a seeded region growing and\nmerging algorithm that was created to segment grey scale and colour\nimages. The approach starts with a set of seed pixels and from these\ngrows regions by appending to each seed pixel those neighbouring pixels\nthat satisfy a certain predicate. Small regions of far away values were\nmerged to neighbouring regions while regions of similar value were also\nmerged. Homogeneity functions are introduced for both grey scale and\ncolour images","authors":["N. Ikonomatakis","Konstantinos Plataniotis","Michalis Zervakis","A.N.
