{"id":"257496481_Shaping_the_online_experience_How_administrators_can_influence_student_and_instructor_perceptions_through_policy_and_practice","abstract":"To maximize the quality of the online experience and actualize the potential of alternative learning environments at their institutions, administrators must explore the perceived experiences of the members of their online learning communities. The overall purpose of the study was to identify factors that would enhance student and instructor experiences in online environments. The focus of the survey was to obtain information from students about their perceptions of the online and blended courses that they participated in and insights from instructors about online and blended courses that they taught. The data collected in this survey reveal optimal areas where a university administration can partner closely with instructors to enhance the student experience in online learning environments and afford online instructors with adequate support and assistance.","authors":["Teshia Roby","Susan Ashe","Neha Singh","Curtis Clark"],"meta":["April 2013The Internet and Higher Education
