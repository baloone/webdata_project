{"id":"328289695_Design_in_context_of_use_An_experiment_with_a_multi-view_and_multi-representation_system_for_collaborative_design","abstract":"The current trend of product design leads to a change in the collaborative working style. To find the most efficient way to exchange information on the digital mock-up of a product, a synchronous co-located collaborative design environment with recent technologies is in needed. A new groupware of multi-view system allows multiple users to have individual visual information of a domain-specific representation of digital mock-up. In this paper, we propose a case study for the development and testing of a co-located multi-view system in collaborative virtual reality, aiming at enhancing the multidisciplinary early collaborative design. An ergonomic method of Personas is introduced to the evaluation of the tool, considering various user performance. With a multidisciplinary mug design scenario, experiments are presented, validating the benefits of the proposed system.","authors":["Bo Li","Frederic Segonds","CÃ©line Mateev Rodrigo","Ruding Lou"],"meta":["December 2018Computers in Industry 103:28-37","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2018.09.006"],"references":["303464618_Using_avatars_to_tailor_ideation_process_to_innovation_strategy","266799824_Proposition_of_a_PLM_tool_to_support_textile_design_A_case_study_applied_to_the_definition_of_the_early_stages_of_design_requirements","262522734_Innovation_and_Design_Approaches_within_Prospective_Ergonomics","262494609_Prospective_ergonomics_Origin_goal_and_prospects","262404591_How_do_designers_and_user_experience_professionals_actually_perceive_and_use_personas","330310611_Persona_A_Method_to_Produce_Representations_Focused_on_Consumers'_Needs","286627554_Hybrid_reality-based_user_experience_and_evaluation_of_a_context-aware_smart_home","282701026_Real_or_imaginary_The_effectiveness_of_using_personas_in_product_design","265579421_Getting_from_Research_to_Personas_Harnessing_the_Power_of_Data","259099435_Using_virtual_reality_and_3D_industrial_numerical_models_for_immersive_interactive_checklists"]}
