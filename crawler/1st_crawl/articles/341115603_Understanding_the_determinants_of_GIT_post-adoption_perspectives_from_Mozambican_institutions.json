{"id":"341115603_Understanding_the_determinants_of_GIT_post-adoption_perspectives_from_Mozambican_institutions","abstract":"This study aims to understand the determinants of geographical information technologies at the scale of post-adoption use and intention to increase the level of use in Mozambican institutions. Three known theories (diffusion of innovation theory, technology – organisation – environment framework, and institutional theory) have been used in order to accomplish the study. The data analysis showed that the variables compatibility, geographical scope, expansion opportunities, and normative pressure contribute to explaining GIT use. Relative advantage, complexity, coercive pressure, and mimetic pressure contribute to explaining the intention to increase GIT levels of use. The model revealed substantial power of explanation for GIT post-adoption.","authors":["Nelson Amade","Tiago Oliveira","M.
