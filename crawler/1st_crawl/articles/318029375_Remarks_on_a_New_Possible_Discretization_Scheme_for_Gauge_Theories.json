{"id":"318029375_Remarks_on_a_New_Possible_Discretization_Scheme_for_Gauge_Theories","abstract":"We propose here a new discretization method for a class continuum gauge theories which action functionnals are polynomials of the curvature. Based on the notion of holonomy, this discretization procedure appears gauge-invariant for discretized analogs of Yang-Mills theories, and hence gauge-fixing is fully rigorous for these discretized action functionnals. Heuristic parts are forwarded to the quantization procedure via Feynman integrals and the meaning of the heuristic infinite dimensional Lebesgue integral is questionned.","authors":["Jean-Pierre Magnot"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Theoretical Physics 57(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-018-3733-3","Project: gauge theories, quantum gravity and decision theory"],"references":["242290299_Geometric_discretization_scheme_applied_to_the_Abelian_Chern-Simons_theory","347143899_Geometric_Integration_Theory","317588928_Loop_Quantum_Gravity","308963399_Vertex_functions_of_Coulomb_gauge_Yang-Mills_theory","278800105_Loop_Quantum_Gravity","267099470_Vertex_functions_of_Coulomb_gauge_Yang--Mills_theory","265996185_Non-Abelian_gauge_theory_for_Chern-Simons_path_integral_on_R_3","265428600_Mathematical_Theory_of_Feynman_Path_Integrals","264859641_Geometric_Integration_Theory","243423805_Yang-Mills_theory_in_a_modified_axial_gauge"]}
