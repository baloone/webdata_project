{"id":"300169251_When_are_Two_Arguments_the_Same_Equivalence_in_Abstract_Argumentation","abstract":"In abstract argumentation arguments are just points in a network of attacks: they do not hold premisses, conclusions or internal structure. So is there a meaningful way in which two arguments, belonging possibly to different attack graphs, can be said to be equivalent? The paper argues for a positive answer and, interfacing methods from modal logic, the theory of argument games and the equational approach to argumentation, puts forth and explores a formal theory of equivalence for abstract argumentation.","authors":["Dov Gabbay","Davide Grossi"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-06025-5_25","In book: Johan van Benthem on Logic and Information Dynamics (pp.677-701)"],"references":["225269971_Social_Software","221539055_Argumentation_and_standards_of_proof","220254331_An_introduction_to_argumentation_semantics","332085854_Logic_in_Games","279952015_Equational_approach_to_argumentation_networks","266404966_Sampling_Logic_and_Argumentation_Networks_A_Manifesto","265951328_Full_Hybrid_m-Calculus_Its_Bisimulation_Invariance_and_Application_to_Argumentation","263329774_Defeasible_Reasoning","259810774_Logical_Dynamics_of_Information_and_Interaction","254219529_The_nets_of_reason","253861443_Doing_Argumentation_Theory_in_Modal_Logic","243596277_Modal_Logic_and_Classical_Logic","229721376_Theory_of_defeasible_reasoning","228815349_Lectures_on_the_modal_-calculus","226561196_Semantics_of_Abstract_Argument_Systems","226525581_Proof_Theories_and_Algorithms_for_Abstract_Argumentation_Frameworks","226390277_Models_of_Persuasion_Dialogue","225070316_The_Uses_of_Argument","225035741_Introduction_to_Lattices_and_Order_-_2nd_Ed","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1","221456000_On_the_logic_of_argumentation_theory","221292885_Argumentation_in_the_View_of_Modal_Logic","221176705_On_the_Issue_of_Reinstatement_in_Argumentation","220907357_Introducing_Equational_Semantics_for_Argumentation_Networks","220441024_Extensive_Games_as_Process_Models","220297914_A_Logical_Account_of_Formal_Argumentation","23573647_A_course_in_Game_Theory"]}
