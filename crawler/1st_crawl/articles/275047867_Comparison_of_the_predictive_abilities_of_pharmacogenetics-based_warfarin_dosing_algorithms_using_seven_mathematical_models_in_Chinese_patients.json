{"id":"275047867_Comparison_of_the_predictive_abilities_of_pharmacogenetics-based_warfarin_dosing_algorithms_using_seven_mathematical_models_in_Chinese_patients","abstract":"This study is aimed to find the best predictive model for warfarin stable dosage.\nSeven models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network, regression tree, boosted regression tree, support vector regression, multivariate adaptive regression spines and random forest regression, as well as the genetic and clinical data of two Chinese samples were employed.\nThe average predicted achievement ratio and mean absolute error of the algorithms were ranging from 52.31 to 58.08% and 4.25 to 4.84 mg/week in validation samples, respectively. The algorithm based on MLR showed the highest predicted achievement ratio and the lowest mean absolute error.\nAt present, MLR may be still the best model for warfarin stable dosage prediction in Chinese population.
