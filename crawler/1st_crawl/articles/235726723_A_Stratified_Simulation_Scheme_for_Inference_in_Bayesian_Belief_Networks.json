{"id":"235726723_A_Stratified_Simulation_Scheme_for_Inference_in_Bayesian_Belief_Networks","abstract":"Simulation schemes for probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks\noffer many advantages over exact algorithms; for example, these schemes have a\nlinear and thus predictable runtime while exact algorithms have exponential\nruntime. Experiments have shown that likelihood weighting is one of the most\npromising simulation schemes. In this paper, we present a new simulation scheme\nthat generates samples more evenly spread in the sample space than the\nlikelihood weighting scheme. We show both theoretically and experimentally that\nthe stratified scheme outperforms likelihood weighting in average runtime and\nerror in estimates of beliefs.","authors":["Remco R.
