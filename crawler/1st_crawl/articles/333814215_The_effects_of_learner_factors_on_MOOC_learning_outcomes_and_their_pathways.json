{"id":"333814215_The_effects_of_learner_factors_on_MOOC_learning_outcomes_and_their_pathways","abstract":"Despite rapid growth in the popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs), few studies have investigated learning outcomes among participating university learners. We first examined student growth in terms of knowledge, attitudes, skills, and aspirations (KASA). We then explored the relationships between learning outcomes and three learner factors: time management pattern, task persistence, and language match. A survey of 94 MOOC learners at five Japanese universities revealed growth in knowledge, attitudes, aspirations, and skills, in that order. Task persistence was most strongly associated with knowledge growth, with knowledge affecting aspirations indirectly via attitudes and skills. Learning frequency, time allocation, and participation in discussions had little impact on KASA growth. Compared with learners studying in a foreign language, those studying in their native language reported greater growth across all learning outcomes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications and offer recommendations for future research.","authors":["Insung Jung","Jihyun Lee"],"meta":["June 2019Innovations in Education and Teaching International 57(5):1-12","DOI:10.1080/14703297.2019.1628800","Project: OER MOOC"],"references":["319133380_Trends_and_Patterns_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_Review_and_Content_Analysis_of_Research_on_MOOCs_2008-2015","318226133_A_Review_of_Empirical_Studies_on_MOOC_Adoption_Applying_the_Unified_Theory_of_Acceptance_and_Use_of_Technology","311858901_MOOCs_What_have_we_learned_so_far","311766005_The_Partial_Least_Squares_Approach_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","303317652_Participation_in_the_Virtual_Environment_of_Blended_College_Courses_An_Activity_Study_of_Student_Performance","296619400_A_Systematic_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_the_Empirical_MOOC_Literature_Published_in_2013-2015","284797914_Motivation_to_Learn_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_Examining_Aspects_of_Language_and_Social_Engagement","282017068_MOOCs_A_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","273298597_Self-motivation_challenges_for_student_involvement_in_the_Open_Educational_Movement_with_MOOC","267453244_MOOCs_a_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","261998315_Exploring_the_Link_between_Stuttering_and_Phonology_A_Review_and_Implications_for_Treatment","236032728_A_Primer_on_Partial_Least_Squares_Structural_Equation_Modeling","232941314_Knowledge_and_the_Prediction_of_Behavior_The_Role_of_Information_Accuracy_in_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","232450715_Relation_of_self-efficacy_beliefs_to_academic_outcomes_A_meta-analytic_investigationJournal_of_Counseling_Psychology_38_30-38","10822958_Negative_Self-Efficacy_and_Goal_Effects_Revisited","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","292950508_Learning_Outcomes_of_a_MOOC_Designed_for_Attitudinal_Change_A_Case_Study_of_an_Animal_Behavior_and_Welfare_MOOC","287360117_Learning_in_MOOCs_Motivations_and_self-regulated_learning_in_MOOCs","283884839_Relation_of_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_to_Academic_Outcomes_A_Meta-Analytic_Investigation","277973614_The_Effects_of_Prior-knowledge_and_Online_Learning_Approaches_on_Students'_Inquiry_and_Argumentation_Abilities","270280459_Online_learner_competencies_Knowledge_skills_and_attitudes_for_successful_learning_in_online_and_blended_settings_The_ibstpi_series","267363395_Targeting_Outcomes_of_Programs_TOP_A_Hierarchy_for_Targeting_Outcomes_and_Evaluating_Their_Achievement_PowerPoint_Presentation","265644736_Instructional_quality_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs","255567036_High_Enrollment_Course_Success_Factors_in_Virtual_School_Factors_influencing_student_academic_achievement","241256313_A_Hierarchy_for_Targeting_Outcomes_and_Evaluating_Their_Achievement","221849821_Psychological_Correlates_of_University_Students'_Academic_Performance_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis"]}
