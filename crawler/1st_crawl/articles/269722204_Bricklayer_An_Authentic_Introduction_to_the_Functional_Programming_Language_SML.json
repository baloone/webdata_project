{"id":"269722204_Bricklayer_An_Authentic_Introduction_to_the_Functional_Programming_Language_SML","abstract":"Functional programming languages are seen by many as instrumental to\neffectively utilizing the computational power of multi-core platforms. As a\nresult, there is growing interest to introduce functional programming and\nfunctional thinking as early as possible within the computer science\ncurriculum. Bricklayer is an API, written in SML, that provides a set of\nabstractions for creating LEGO artifacts which can be viewed using LEGO Digital\nDesigner. The goal of Bricklayer is to create a problem space (i.e., a set of\nLEGO artifacts) that is accessible and engaging to programmers (especially\nnovice programmers) while providing an authentic introduction to the functional\nprogramming language SML.","authors":["Victor L.
