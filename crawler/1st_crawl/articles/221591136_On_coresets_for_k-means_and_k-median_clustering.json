{"id":"221591136_On_coresets_for_k-means_and_k-median_clustering","abstract":"In this paper, we show the existence of small coresets for the problems of computing k-median and k-means clustering for points in low dimension. In other words, we show that given a point set P in Rd, one can compute a weighted set S ⊆ P, of size O(k ε-d log n), such that one can compute the k-median/means clustering on S instead of on P, and get an (1+ε)-approximation. As a result, we improve the fastest known algorithms for (1+ε)-approximate k-means and k-median. Our algorithms have linear running time for a fixed k and ε. In addition, we can maintain the (1+ε)-approximate k-median or k-means clustering of a stream when points are being only inserted, using polylogarithmic space and update time.","authors":["Sariel Har-Peled","Soham Mazumdar"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1145/1007352.1007400","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Chicago, IL, USA, June 13-16, 2004"],"references":["234054500_Optimal_Time_Bounds_for_Approximate_Clustering","221499630_Efficient_Regular_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_for_Location_and_Proximity_Problems","220984093_Applications_of_Weighted_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_Randomization_to_Variance-Based","47842747_Simple_randomized_algorithms_for_closest_pair_problems","2822840_Efficient_Regular_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_for_Dilation_Location_and_Proximity_Problems","262392783_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k_-median_problem_extended_abstract","262234261_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Metric_Facility_Location_and_k-Median_Problems","245848484_Decompositional_searching_problems_I_static-to-dynamic_transformations","232634249_Polynomial_time_approximation_schemes_for_Euclidean_TSP_and_other_geometric_problems","227273551_On_Approximate_Geometric_k-Clustering","222680788_A_Constant-Factor_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Median_Problem","222590375_Decomposable_searching_problems_I_Static-to-dynamic_transformation","222543557_A_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-Means_Clustering","222473678_Clustering_to_minimize_the_maximum_intercluster_distance","221591411_Approximation_schemes_for_clustering_problems","221591356_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Clustering","221591061_Sublinear_Time_Algorithms_for_Metric_Space_Problems","220983900_Projective_clustering_in_high_dimensions_using_core-sets","220770062_Approximation_Algorithms_for_k-Line_Center","220617788_A_Nearly_Linear-Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Euclidean_k_-Median_Problem","220556636_Optimal_core-sets_for_balls","3921147_A_replacement_for_Voronoi_diagrams_of_near_linear_size","3880912_Clustering_data_streams","3832197_Improved_Combinatorial_Algorithms_for_Facility_Location_Problems","2914276_A_Replacement_for_Voronoi_Diagrams_of_Near_Linear_Size","2907941_Clustering_Motion","2398803_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Euclidean_Traveling_Salesman_and_Other_Geometric_Problems"]}
