{"id":"316047383_ArbAlign_A_Tool_for_Optimal_Alignment_of_Arbitrarily_Ordered_Isomers_Using_the_Kuhn-Munkres_Algorithm","abstract":"When assessing the similarity between two isomers whose atoms are ordered identically, one typically translates and rotates their Cartesian coordinates for best alignment and computes the pairwise root mean square deviation (RMSD). However, if the atoms are ordered differently or the molecular axes are switched, it is necessary to find the best ordering of the atoms and check for optimal axes before calculating a meaningful pairwise RMSD. The factorial scaling of finding the best ordering by looking at all permutations is too expensive for any system with more than ten atoms. We report use of the Kuhn-Munkres matching algorithm to reduce the cost of finding the best ordering from factorial to polynomial scaling. That allows the application of this scheme to any arbitrary system efficiently. Its performance is demonstrated for a range of molecular clusters as well as rigid systems.
