{"id":"325516202_Deep-Learning_Enabled_On-Demand_Design_of_Chiral_Metamaterials","abstract":"Deep learning framework has significantly impelled the development of modern machine learning technology by continuously pushing the limit of traditional recognition and processing of images, speech and videos. In the meantime, it starts to penetrate other disciplines, such as biology, genetics, materials science and physics. Here we report a deep learning based model, comprising two bidirectional neural networks assembled by a partial stacking strategy, to automatically design and optimize three-dimensional chiral metamaterials with strong chiroptical responses at predesignated wavelengths. The model can help to discover the intricate, non-intuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the time-consuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently, but also enables to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements. Our results demonstrate that such a data-driven model can be applied as a very powerful tool in studying complicated light-matter interactions, and accelerating the on-demand design of nanophotonic devices, systems and architectures for real world applications.","authors":["Wei Ma","Feng Cheng","Yongmin Liu"],"meta":["June 2018ACS Nano 12(6)","DOI:10.1021/acsnano.8b03569"],"references":["320025107_Nanoscopic_control_and_quantification_of_enantioselective_optical_forces","318670863_Machine_Learning_and_Materials_Informatics_Recent_Applications_and_Prospects","316955101_Deep_Learning_Microscopy","311306736_Quantum-Chemical_Insights_from_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Networks","304662289_A_Multithread_Nested_Neural_Network_Architecture_to_Model_Surface_Plasmon_Polaritons_Propagation","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","282115669_Circularly_Polarized_Light_Detection_with_Hot_Electrons_in_Chiral_Plasmonic_Metamaterials","277782484_Accurate_secondary_structure_prediction_and_fold_recognition_for_circular_dichroism_spectroscopy","277411157_Deep_Learning","263710153_Reconfigurable_3D_plasmonic_metamolecules","263704884_Searching_for_Exotic_Particles_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Learning","258097900_Tailoring_Enhanced_Optical_Chirality_Design_Principles_for_Chiral_Plasmonic_Nanostructures","249650080_Topology_optimization_of_grating_couplers_for_the_efficient_excitation_of_surface_plasmons","226570658_Maximizing_band_gaps_in_two-dimensional_photonic_crystals_by_using_level_set_methods","222467943_Stacked_Generalization","221709110_DNA-based_Self-Assembly_of_Chiral_Plasmonic_Nanostructures_with_Tailored_Optical_Response","47636268_Ultrasensitive_detection_and_characterization_of_biomolecules_using_superchiral_fields","45936455_Advanced_Jones_calculus_for_the_classification_of_periodic_metamaterials","44683387_Biocatalytic_Asymmetric_Synthesis_of_Chiral_Amines_from_Ketones_Applied_to_Sitagliptin_Manufacture","26756770_Gold_Helix_Photonic_Metamaterial_as_Broadband_Circular_Polarizer","24173619_Negative_Refractive_Index_in_Chiral_Metamaterials","7241113_Three-Dimensional_Chiral_Imaging_by_Sum-Frequency_Generation","6644733_Asymmetric_Propagation_of_Electromagnetic_Waves_through_a_Planar_Chiral_Structure","6414497_Greenfield_NJ_Using_circular_dichroism_spectra_to_estimate_protein_secondary_structure_Nat_Protoc_1_2876-2890","5427874_A_sensitivity-enhanced_field-effect_chiral_sensor","3132288_Neural_Network_Inverse_Modeling_and_Applications_to_Microwave_Filter_Design","320650127_Preserving_Spin_States_upon_Reflection_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Responses_of_a_Chiral_Meta-Mirror","320413251_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_the_Inverse_Design_of_Nanophotonic_Structures","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319660855_Nanophotonic_Inverse_Design_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network","312492493_Deep_Learning_for_Computational_Chemistry","308739139_Circular_Dichroism_Metamirrors_with_Near-Perfect_Extinction","307957628_Optical_chiral_metamaterials_A_review_of_the_fundamentals_fabrication_methods_and_applications","303859227_Solving_the_Quantum_Many-Body_Problem_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks","302377136_Machine_learning_phases_of_matter","291295837_Reasoning_with_neural_tensor_networks_for_knowledge_base_completion","279172338_Chiral_mirrors","267930491_Subwavelength_Lattice_Optics_by_Evolutionary_Design","261519306_Optofluidic_sorting_of_material_chirality_by_chiral_light","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","259723296_Giant_Chiral_Optical_Response_from_a_Twisted-Arc_Metamaterial","258799026_Chiral_metamaterials_From_optical_activity_and_negative_refractive_index_to_asymmetric_transmission","254021740_Design_of_metamaterials_using_artificial_neural_networks","235404218_Tailoring_the_Dispersion_of_Plasmonic_Nanorods_To_Realize_Broadband_Optical_Meta-Waveplates","223994489_Three-Dimensional_Chiral_Plasmonic_Oligomers","215595276_Chiral_Discrimination_of_Monosaccharides_Using_a_Fluorescent_Molecular_Sensor","49754969_Metamaterials_a_New_Frontier_of_Science_and_Technology","12040931_Shelby_R_A_Smith_D_R_Schultz_S_Experimental_verification_of_a_negative_index_of_refraction_Science_292_77-79","5628036_Optical_properties_of_fourteen_metals_in_the_infrared_and_far_infrared_Al_Co_Cu_Au_Fe_Pb_Mo_Ni_Pd_Pt_Ag_Ti_V_and_W"]}
