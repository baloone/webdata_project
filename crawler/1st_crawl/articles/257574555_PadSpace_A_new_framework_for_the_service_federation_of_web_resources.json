{"id":"257574555_PadSpace_A_new_framework_for_the_service_federation_of_web_resources","abstract":"End-users need a simple and interactive tool for service composition development. A PadSpace proposes an extension of a typical Linda-like coordination model (tuplespace) to provide mechanisms for the interoperation among Web applications, Web services and end-usersâ€™ local functional resources. First, a PadSpace provides an end-user supporting tool for composing Web applications, Web services, and local visual resources based on the meme media architecture without writing any program codes. It enables end-users to directly manipulate visual components, and to create new composite components for the creation of services that use Web applications, Web services, and local functional resources. Second, a PadSpace provides a spreadsheet-based service-coordination tool for end-users to orchestrate multiple Web applications, Web services, and local functional resources. Finally, we show some new applications of service composition and service orchestration.","authors":["Damdinsuren Lkhamsuren","Yuzuru Tanaka"],"meta":["March 2013Information Systems Frontiers 15(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10796-011-9324-y"],"references":["221607904_End-user_programming_of_mashups_with_Vegemite","220877248_Clip_connect_clone_Combining_application_elements_to_build_custom_interfaces_for_information_access","200086108_Estimating_the_Numbers_of_End_Users_and_End_User_Programmers","240424863_XMLSpacesNET_An_Extensible_Tuplespace_as_XML_Middleware","221329247_IntelligentPad_A_Hypermedia_System_Allowing_Functional_Compositions_of_Active_Media_Objects_Through_Direct_Manipulations","220695782_Meme_Media_and_Meme_Market_Architectures_Knowledge_Media_for_Editing_Distributing_and_Managing_Intellectual_Resources","220404862_Generative_communication_in_LINDA","215439597_Linda_in_Context","3601986_IntelligentBox_A_constructive_visual_software_development_system_for_interactive_3D_graphic_applications"]}
