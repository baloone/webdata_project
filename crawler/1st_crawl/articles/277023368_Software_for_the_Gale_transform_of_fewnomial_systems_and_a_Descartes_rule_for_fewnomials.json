{"id":"277023368_Software_for_the_Gale_transform_of_fewnomial_systems_and_a_Descartes_rule_for_fewnomials","abstract":"We give a Descartes'-like bound on the number of positive solutions to a\nsystem of fewnomials that holds when its exponent vectors are not in convex\nposition and a sign condition is satisfied. This was discovered while\ndeveloping algorithms and software for computing the Gale transform of a\nfewnomial system, which is our main goal. This software is a component of a\npackage we are developing for Khovanskii-Rolle continuation, which is a\nnumerical algorithm to compute the real solutions to a system of fewnomials.","authors":["Daniel J.
