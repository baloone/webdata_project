{"id":"338813317_Artificial_intelligence_in_the_diagnosis_of_cardiovascular_disease","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to mimic human thought processes. AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enabling cost-effectiveness, and reducing readmission and mortality rates. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI’s application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.","authors":["Rubens Moura Campos Zeron","Carlos Vicente Serrano Junior"],"meta":["December 2019Revista da Associação Médica Brasileira 65(12):1438-1441","DOI:10.1590/1806-9282.65.12.1438"],"references":["306096925_Using_recurrent_neural_network_models_for_early_detection_of_heart_failure_onset","306022451_Detection_of_Cardiovascular_Disease_Risk's_Level_for_Adults_Using_Naive_Bayes_Classifier","292075221_Diagnosis_of_Acute_Coronary_Syndrome_with_a_Support_Vector_Machine","319770249_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions","319319724_MULTIVARIABLE_PROGNOSTIC_MODELS_ISSUES_IN_DEVELOPING_MODELS_EVALUATING_ASSUMPTIONS_AND_ADEQUACY_AND_MEASURING_AND_REDUCING_ERRORS","308813785_Deep_visual-semantic_alignments_for_generating_image_descriptions","303849578_Cognitive_Machine-Learning_Algorithm_for_Cardiac_Imaging_A_Pilot_Study_for_Differentiating_Constrictive_Pericarditis_From_Restrictive_Cardiomyopathy","303746566_Machine_learning_for_prediction_of_all-cause_mortality_in_patients_with_suspected_coronary_artery_disease_A_5-year_multicentre_prospective_registry_analysis","286525983_Comparative_Performance_of_ATRIA_CHADS2_and_CHA2DS2-VASc_Risk_Scores_Predicting_Stroke_in_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation_Results_From_a_National_Primary_Care_Database","284007010_Comparative_Performance_of_ATRIA_CHADS2_and_CHA2DS2-VASc_Risk_Scores_Predicting_Stroke_in_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation"]}
