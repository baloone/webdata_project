{"id":"300250695_A_Double_Auction_Mechanism_for_On-Demand_Transport_Networks","abstract":"Market mechanisms play a key role in allocating and pricing commuters and drivers in new on-demand transport services such as Uber, and Liftago in Prague. These services successfully use different mechanisms, which suggests a need to understand the behavior of a range of mechanisms within the context of on-demand transport. In this paper, we propose a double auction mechanism and compare its performance to a mechanism inspired by Liftagoâ€™s approach. We show that our mechanism can improve efficiency and satisfy key properties such as weak budget balance and truthfulness.","authors":["Malcolm Egan","Martin Schaefer","Michal Jakob","Nir Oren"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25524-8_38","Conference: International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems"],"references":["272686783_Analyzing_On-demand_Mobility_Services_by_Agent-based_Simulation","265596511_A_Profit-Aware_Negotiation_Mechanism_for_On-Demand_Transport_Services","283533091_Optimizing_efficiency_of_taxi_systems_Scaling-up_and_handling_arbitrary_constraints","262221632_Optimal_pricing_for_improving_efficiency_of_taxi_systems","256227688_A_dominant_strategy_double_auction","228217170_Optimal_Multi-Period_Pricing_with_Service_Guarantees"]}
