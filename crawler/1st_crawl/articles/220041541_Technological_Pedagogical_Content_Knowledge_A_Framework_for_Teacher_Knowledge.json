{"id":"220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge","abstract":"Research in the area of educational technology has often been critiqued for a lack of theoretical grounding. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for educational technology by building on Shulman's formulation of \"pedagogical content knowledge\" and extend it to the phenomenon of teachers integrating technology into their pedagogy. This framework is the result of 5 years of work on a program of research focused on teacher professional development and faculty development in higher education. It attempts to capture some of the essential qualities of teacher knowledge required for technology integration in teaching, while addressing the complex, multifaceted, and situated nature of this knowledge. We argue, briefly, that thoughtful pedagogical uses of technology require the development of a complex, situated form of knowledge that we call Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). In doing so, we posit the complex roles of, and interplay among, three main components of learning environments: content, pedagogy, and technology. We argue that this model has much to offer to discussions of technology integration at multiple levels: theoretical, pedagogical, and methodological. In this article, we describe the theory behind our framework, provide examples of our teaching approach based upon the framework, and illustrate the methodological contributions that have resulted from this work.","authors":["Punya Mishra","Matthew J Koehler"],"meta":["June 2006Teachers College Record 108:1017-1054","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"],"references":["307687314_Webs_of_activity_in_online_course_design_and_teaching","277831717_Successful_Teaching_with_Technology_The_Complex_Interplay_of_Content_Pedagogy_and_Technology","272177675_Cognitive_Flexibility_Theory_Advanced_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_Ill-Structured_Domains","269459595_A_Framework_for_Understanding_Teaching_With_the_Internet","260061859_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Taxonomies","258028835_Design-Based_Research_An_Emerging_Paradigm_for_Educational_Inquiry","255566844_Exploring_Teaching_Learning_and_Instructional_Reform_in_an_Introductory_Technology_Course","255057543_Using_Action_Research_to_Develop_Preservice_Teachers'_Confidence_Knowledge_and_Beliefs_about_Technology","244473334_Not_what_but_how_Becoming_design-wise_about_educational_technology","244457271_Design_Experiments_in_Educational_Research","346956413_Knowing_and_Teaching_Elementary_Mathematics_Teachers'_Understanding_of_Fundamental_Mathematics_in_China_and_the_United_States","343975330_Developing_science_teachers'_pedagogical_content_knowledge","330868889_The_Essential_Tension_Selected_Studies_in_Scientific_Tradition_and_Change","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","319352633_Developing_science_teachers'_pedagogical_content_knowledge","313475155_Guided_Discovery_in_a_Community_of_Learners","313187423_Research_on_science_teacher_education","313075408_Organizational_learning_and_communities-of-practice_Toward_a_unified_view_of_working_learning_and_innovation","303151043_The_Aims_of_Education","300932496_Using_Patterns_and_Plans_in_Chess","291961392_Art_from_randomness_how_inverso_uses_chance_to_create_haiku","288066937_From_Concept_to_Software","285741066_Teacher_Learning_and_the_Mathematics_Reforms_What_We_Think_We_Know_and_What_We_Need_to_Learn","285351539_Autocrine_stimulation_of_anchorage_independent_growth_in_cloned_human_bladder_cancer_cell_lines","280786855_Teacher_knowledge_of_educational_technology_A_case_study_of_studentmentor_teacher_pairs","277530961_Pedagogical_Content_Knowing_An_Integrative_Model_for_Teacher_Preparation","277428236_Enacting_Project-Based_Science","274200398_Knowing_And_The_Known","274110220_The_Reader_the_Text_the_Poem_The_Transactional_Theory_of_the_Literary_Work","272177768_150_different_ways_of_knowing_Representations_of_knowledge_in_teaching","272088622_Sciences_of_The_Artificial","265714013_Knowing_and_teaching_elementary_mathematics_teacher's_understanding_of_fundamental_mathematics_in_China_and_the_United_States","262322763_Reflective_conversation_with_materials","260292436_Authentic_School_Science","257926429_The_Culture_of_Acquisition_and_the_Practice_of_Understanding","255566789_The_Role_of_Teacher_Knowledge_and_Learning_Experiences_in_Forming_Technology-Integrated_Pedagogy","254906262_What's_In_What's_Out_-_An_Analysis_of_State_Educational_Technology_Plans","249704409_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_From_a_Mathematical_Case_to_a_Modified_Conception","247374399_Reflective_Conversation_with_Materials","247341954_Perception_in_Chess","246554002_Is_the_scientific_paper_a_fraud","246254725_From_Preparation_to_Practice_Designing_a_Continuum_to_Strengthen_and_Sustain_Teaching","246053667_Emergence_of_technology_standards_for_preservice_teacher_education","244527730_What''s_in_and_what''s_out_An_analysis_of_state_technology_plans","244516589_Three_computers_in_the_back_of_the_classroom_Pre-service_teachers''conceptions_of_technology_integration","243775737_Learning_With_Peers_From_Small_Group_Cooperation_to_Collaborative_Communities","243775280_The_knower_and_the_known_The_nature_of_knowledge_on_teaching","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","243694392_The_Reflective_Practitioner","243476256_What_is_This_Thing_Called_Science","242389365_Critical_Issues_Literacy_Technologies_What_Stance_Should_We_Take","242594551_Dialogue_on_Early_Childhood_Science_Mathematics_and_Technology_Education_First_Experiences_in_Science_Mathematics_and_Technology","242513310_Software_Design_as_a_Learning_Environment","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform","240801971_Chapter_1_The_Knower_and_the_Known_The_Nature_of_Knowledge_in_Research_on_Teaching"]}
