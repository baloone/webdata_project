{"id":"280371898_VM_Migration_A_Survey","abstract":"Virtual Machine (VM) refers to an operating system or application environment running on a software that imitates dedicated hardware without change in end-user experience. VM migration refers to the movement of VMs from one physical machine to the other while trying to minimize its impact on the performance of VM and its applications. VM migration has several benefits like server consolidation, load balancing and so on. In this survey paper, we look at VM migration benefits, techniques, performance metrics and also, recent research conducted around VM migration techniques and optimizations to improve the process to suit specific workloads.","authors":["Usha Keshavamurthy","H S Guruprasad"],"meta":["July 2015Global Journal of Engineering Science and Researches 2(7):219-224"],"references":["286595067_Fast_Server_Deprovisioning_through_Scatter-Gather_Live_Migration_of_Virtual_Machines","276315587_Principles_and_Performance_Characteristics_of_Algorithms_for_Live_VM_Migration","269402099_Time-Bound_Thread-Based_Live_Migration_of_Virtual_Machines","266660722_Traffic-aware_clustering_and_VM_migration_in_distributed_data_center","299692351_Analytic_Performance_Modeling_and_Optimization_of_Live_VM_Migration","290560425_A_fast_convergent_live_migration_of_virtual_machine","271225406_Early_experiences_with_live_migration_of_SR-IOV_enabled_InfiniBand","266660087_SDN-based_Live_VM_Migration_Across_Datacenters","262390842_Batch_scheduling_of_consolidated_virtual_machines_based_on_their_workload_interference_model","262171011_MiG_efficient_migration_of_desktop_VMs_using_semantic_compression"]}
