The major focus of the research is on existence of cross product in n-dimension through casual and descriptive research design. Aside from this, applications of cross product in engineering mathematics, physics and computer science has been highlighted for empirical solution to several problems.","authors":["Krishna Kumar Chaudhary","Bharat Sharma","Ranju Thapa","Anjay kumar Mishra"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.36347/sjpms.2020.v07i10.001"],"references":["322943018_Cross_Products_of_Vectors_in_Higher_Dimensional_Euclidean_Spaces","247043479_On_the_Non-Existence_of_Elements_of_Hopf_Invariant_One"]}
