{"id":"308504217_EXPLORATORY_STUDY_ON_THE_FLUTTER_BEHAVIOR_OF_MODERN_YACHT_KEELS_AND_APPENDAGES","abstract":"As a result of the tremendous increase in the speed of racing yachts over the last 2 decades, keel flutter has appeared as a major technical issue for designers to address. Recently the IMOCA class rewrote its keel scantling rules, in part to address this issue. Flutter occurs when different natural frequencies of a lifting surface (wing, keel, rudder, hydrofoil etc.) combine together causing a coupling in the motion that draws energy from the surrounding fluid. The vibration or motion is self-excited and its amplitude grows quickly, leading to dangerous and sometimes catastrophic outcomes. This paper presents the results of a 24 month collaboration between Bureau Veritas and Farr Yacht Design regarding keel flutter on racing yachts. The aim of this work was to validate and test an analysis tool for flutter assessment. The method is based on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) experience from the shipbuilding and aeronautical industry. The first step of this collaboration was to validate the method by examining three 'as built' keels, representing a wide range of known flutter behaviour. The results presented here show good a correlation between on-the-water experience and the calculated predictions. Finally a 2014 IMOCA 60 keel, designed to the latest keel scantling rules was analysed using a full 3D solid element finite element model. Results are discussed. The collaboration has validated the methodology and tool, and enhanced our understanding of keel flutter.","authors":["Luc Mouton","Alon Finkelstein"],"meta":["March 2015","Conference: High Performance Yacht Design conferenceAt: Auckland"],"references":["287434352_Hydrodynamics_of_high-speed_marine_vehicles"]}
