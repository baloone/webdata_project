{"id":"260358194_Coloring-Based_Inter-WBAN_Scheduling_for_Mobile_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","abstract":"In this study, random incomplete coloring (RIC) with low time-complexity and high spatial reuse is proposed to overcome in-between wireless-body-area-networks (WBAN) interference, which can cause serious throughput degradation and energy waste. Interference-avoidance scheduling of wireless networks can be modeled as a problem of graph coloring. For instance, high spatial-reuse scheduling for a dense sensor network is mapped to high spatial-reuse coloring; fast convergence scheduling for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is mapped to low time-complexity coloring. However, for a dense and mobile WBAN, inter-WBAN scheduling (IWS) should simultaneously satisfy both of the following requirements: 1) high spatial-reuse and 2) fast convergence, which are tradeoffs in conventional coloring. By relaxing the coloring rule, the proposed distributed coloring algorithm RIC avoids this tradeoff and satisfies both requirements. Simulation results verify that the proposed coloring algorithm effectively overcomes inter-WBAN interference and invariably supports higher system throughput in various mobile WBAN scenarios compared to conventional colorings.","authors":["Shih Heng Cheng","Ching Yao Huang"],"meta":["February 2013IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 24(2):250-259","DOI:10.1109/TPDS.2012.133"],"references":["228637322_Distributed_coloring_in_O_log_n_bit_rounds","220952519_Distributed_coloring_in_Ospl_tildespl_radiclog_n_bit_rounds","3737250_A_Five-Phase_Reservation_Protocol_FPRP_for_mobile_Ad_Hoc_networks","3235939_Provisioning_of_Adaptability_to_Variable_Topologies_for_Routing_Schemes_in_MANETs","3196773_A_Survey_on_Sensor_Networks","2458364_On_the_Lambert_W_Function","242791786_Simple_Distributed_1Coloring_of_Graphs","242491364_Introduction_to_graph_theory_-_second_edition","224355482_Power_Model_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Network","221984552_Link_scheduling_in_wireless_sensor_networks_Distributed_edge-coloring_revisited","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","221313066_Inter-User_Interference_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_Preliminary_Investigation_and_an_Infrastructure-Based_Solution","220761849_An_augmented_graph-based_coloring_scheme_to_derive_upper_bounds_for_the_performance_of_distributed_schedulers_in_CSMA-based_mbile_ad_hoc_networks","220617850_Set_Partitioning_via_Inclusion-Exclusion","220345454_Nearly_optimal_distributed_edge_coloring_in_Olog_log_n_rounds","220292622_Unified_framework_and_algorithm_for_channel_assignment_in_wireless_networks","220247677_About_Randomised_Distributed_Graph_Colouring_and_Graph_Partition_Algorithms","220200814_Applications_challenges_and_prospective_in_emerging_body_area_networking_technologies","220133776_Body_Area_Networks_A_Survey","4220180_Mobility_support_enhancements_for_the_WiMedia_UWB_MAC_protocol","3416559_Interference_between_Bluetooth_networks_-_Upper_bound_on_the_packet_error_rate","3155020_Mutual_interference_between_independent_Bluetooth_piconets","2587750_Load_Reduction_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Using_Mobile_Servers","2563707_A_Survey_of_Mobility_Models_for_Ad_Hoc_Network_Research"]}
