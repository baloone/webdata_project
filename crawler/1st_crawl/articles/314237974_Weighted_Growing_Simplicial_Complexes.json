{"id":"314237974_Weighted_Growing_Simplicial_Complexes","abstract":"Simplicial complexes describe collaboration networks, protein interaction networks and brain networks and in general network structures in which the interactions can include more than two nodes. In real applications, often simplicial complexes are weighted. Here we propose a non-equilibrium model for weighted growing simplicial complexes. The proposed dynamics is able to generate weighted simplicial complexes with a rich interplay between weights and topology emerging not just at the level of nodes and links, but also at the level of faces of higher dimension.","authors":["Owen T.
