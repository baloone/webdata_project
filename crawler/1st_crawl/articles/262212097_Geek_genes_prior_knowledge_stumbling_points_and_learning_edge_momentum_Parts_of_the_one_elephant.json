Some academics believe that such a distribution is due to their being an innate talent for programming, a \"geek gene\". Robins introduced the concept of learning edge momentum, which offers an alternative explanation for the purported bimodal grade distribution. In this paper, we analyze empirical data from a real introductory programming class, looking for evidence of geek genes, learning edge momentum and other possible factors.","authors":["Alireza Ahadi","Raymond Lister"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1145/2493394.2493416","Conference: Proceedings of the ninth annual international ACM conference on International computing education research"],"references":["4986645_Is_Human_Height_Bimodal","228758380_Learning_edge_momentum_A_new_account_of_outcomes_in_CS1"]}
