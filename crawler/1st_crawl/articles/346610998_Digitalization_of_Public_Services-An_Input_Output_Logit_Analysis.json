{"id":"346610998_Digitalization_of_Public_Services-An_Input_Output_Logit_Analysis","abstract":"In 2000, Sri Lanka designed an ambitious plan for the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) in most government functions and in the public service delivery (PSD) system in the country. This process started in the early 2000s and gained momentum with several local and internationally funded initiatives. A systematic innovation concept was incorporated within the ICT regime, which ensured bottom-up learning for a smooth transformation from paper to digitized PSD systems. Towards this end, the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) and Lanka Government Network (LGN) were established. ICT incorporation covered the operations of most government agencies and departments to improve governance and PSD. We analyzed the efficiency of the ICT regime to understand its impact on public service employee output as well as on services to the public. We collected service delivery data from both the employees and their clients using a Likert-scale questionnaire. The questionnaire enquired about the utility of the ICT regime introduced in various departments and ministries (DMs) of the Sri Lankan government. This paper analyzes the overall and relative effectiveness of the ICT regime in terms of the inputs incurred and the outcomes realized. First, we calculated the Cronbach's alpha to test the robustness of the data. Second, we applied ordinal logistics analysis to understand the interrelations among various measures (inputs) and their impacts (outcomes). Finally, we conducted specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value analysis to assess the accuracy of the investigative model. Our findings suggest a positive correlation between the inputs and the outcomes of the ICT regime introduced to digitalize PSD. Our results further indicate that although the inputs and the outcomes are positively corelated, this correlation is not sufficiently strong, and the ICT implementation measures need further emphasis to demonstrate any significant impact on user confidence in this regime.","authors":["Shahzadah Nayyar Jehan","Mudalige Uthpala"],"meta":["December 2020Applied System Innovation 3(4):56","DOI:10.3390/asi3040056","Projects: Global Education Members' Symposium (G.E.M.S)Publications"],"references":["345681660_Efficiency_of_Public_Service_Delivery-A_Post-ICT_Deployment_Analysis","344664743_An_Analysis_of_the_Implementation_of_Business_Process_Re-engineering_in_Public_Services","336148935_A_method_for_ordinal_outcomes_The_ordered_stereotype_model","325402632_Lost_in_transition_linking_war_war_economy_and_post-war_crime_in_Sri_Lanka","318983813_BPR_in_large_public_organizations_A_case_of_managing_change_in_a_developing_country","333581668_Critical_success_factors_for_Polish_agricultural_distributors","305985546_Chapter_16_Development_of_E-Governance_in_Sri_Lanka","291309871_Development_of_e-governance_in_Sri_Lanka","286732860_Ordinal_regression_analysis_Using_generalized_ordinal_logistic_regression_models_to_estimate_educational_data","281234849_Explaining_Citizens'_E-Participation_Usage_Functionality_of_E-Participation_Applications"]}
