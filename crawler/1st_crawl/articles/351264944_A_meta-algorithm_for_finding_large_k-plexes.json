{"id":"351264944_A_meta-algorithm_for_finding_large_k-plexes","abstract":"We focus on the automatic detection of communities in large networks, a challenging problem in many disciplines (such as sociology, biology, and computer science). Humans tend to associate to form families, villages, and nations. Similarly, the elements of real-world networks naturally tend to form highly connected groups. A popular model to represent such structures is the clique, that is, a set of fully interconnected nodes. However, it has been observed that cliques are too strict to represent communities in practice. The k-plex relaxes the notion of clique, by allowing each node to miss up to k connections. Although k-plexes are more flexible than cliques, finding them is more challenging as their number is greater. In addition, most of them are small and not significant. In this paper we tackle the problem of finding only large k-plexes (i.e., comparable in size to the largest clique) and design a meta-algorithm that can be used on top of known enumeration algorithms to return only significant k-plexes in a fraction of the time. Our approach relies on: (1) methods for strongly reducing the search space and (2) decomposition techniques based on the efficient computation of maximal cliques. We demonstrate experimentally that known enumeration algorithms equipped with our approach can run orders of magnitude faster than full enumeration.","authors":["Alessio Conte","Donatella Firmani","Maurizio Patrignani","Riccardo Torlone"],"meta":["July 2021Knowledge and Information Systems 63(1â€“3):1-25","DOI:10.1007/s10115-021-01570-8"],"references":["342546419_Enumerating_Maximal_k-Plexes_with_Worst-Case_Time_Guarantee","337018439_Shared-Nothing_Distributed_Enumeration_of_2-Plexes","326496506_D2K_Scalable_Community_Detection_in_Massive_Networks_via_Small-Diameter_k-Plexes","308273789_A_fast_and_complete_algorithm_for_enumerating_pseudo-cliques_in_large_graphs","335134480_A_Swap-Based_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_k-Plex_Problem","326205548_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_Maximum_k-Plexes_in_Massive_Graphs","318915539_Fast_Enumeration_of_Large_k-Plexes","315536050_Parallelizing_maximal_clique_and_k-plex_enumeration_over_graph_data","313061622_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph_algorithm_457","306191193_Clique_relaxation_models_in_social_network_analysis","303496669_Finding_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Very_Large_Social_Networks","277723024_An_Improved_Upper_Bound_on_Maximal_Clique_Listing_via_Rectangular_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","254464200_Fast_algorithms_for_maximal_clique_enumeration_with_limited_memory","300590376_Efficient_Enumeration_of_Maximal_k-Plexes","249216536_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Enumerating_All_the_Maximal_k_-Plexes"]}
