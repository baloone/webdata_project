Three hundred fifty one faculty members responded. The responses to one survey item form the basis of this paper: \"In your experience, what is the most difficult topic to teach in CS1?\" This paper describes the demographics of the respondents and present a content analysis of the responses to this item. The analysis indicates that the difficult topics fall into four categories: problem solving and design, general programming topics, object-oriented constructs, and student maturity (or lack thereof).
