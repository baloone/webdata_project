{"id":"271713552_Securing_data_exchange_in_wireless_multimedia_sensor_networks_perspectives_and_challenges","abstract":"The emerging use of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) and communication facilities have increased the need for network security measures to protect different types of multimedia data either real time or non-real time during the transmission period. A lot of researchers are becoming more interested on secure WMSNs due to the broad application necessities which can be range over smart environment, security surveillance and smart health-care; so requirements on secure aggregation of multimedia data, Quality of Service (QoS) and privacy should be satisfied. Current technologies vs. proposed security techniques in WMSNs and its pros and cons from a security point of view are explored in details. In addition to promising future trends of this research area by giving more attention for new challenging problems including secure routing protocol, fault tolerant, robustness and recovery process. We believe that this paper will add significantly a valuable discussion among the researchers and promote them to fetch new research ideas to design approximately best model by combining the most important security issues in order to reach secure WMSNs.","authors":["Musab Ghadi","Lamri Laouamer","Tarek Moulahi"],"meta":["January 2015Multimedia Tools and Applications 75(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-014-2443-y"],"references":["261350124_Secure_data_aggregation_in_wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks_via_watermarking","327101903_Delay_tolerant_networks_Protocols_and_applications","313560043_Trust-based_decision_making_for_electronic_transactions","304528507_Simulation_of_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks_WMSN","266484933_Image_Quality_Estimation_in_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks_An_Experimental_Study","263252931_Coverage_Exploration_and_Deployment_by_a_Mobile_Robot_and_Communication_Network_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Guest_Editors_Yuh-Shyan_Chen_Yu-Chee_Tseng_Ying_Zhang_Feng_Zhao","263164697_ECG-Cryptography_and_Authentication_in_Body_Area_Networks","261487765_Trust_Based_Secured_Routing_in_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks","261318287_A_Novel_Partial_Dynamic_Reconfiguration_Image_Sensor_Node_for_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks","261273515_Energy-efficient_protocol_based_sleep-scheduling_for_wireless_sensor_networks"]}
