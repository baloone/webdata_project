{"id":"242913834_The_Joints_Problem_in_mathbbRn","abstract":"We show that given a collection of A lines in \\R^n, n\\geq 2, the maximum number of their joints (points incident to at least n lines whose directions form a linearly independent set) is O(A^{n/(n-1)}). An analogous result for smooth algebraic curves is also proven.
