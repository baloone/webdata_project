{"id":"275364485_Random_projections_for_Bayesian_regression","abstract":"This article deals with random projections applied as a data reduction\ntechnique for Bayesian regression analysis. We show sufficient conditions under\nwhich the entire $d$-dimensional distribution is approximately preserved under\nrandom projections by reducing the number of data points from $n$ to $k\\in\nO(\\operatorname{poly}(d/\\varepsilon))$ in the case $n\\gg d$. Under mild\nassumptions, we prove that evaluating a Gaussian likelihood function based on\nthe projected data instead of the original data yields a\n$(1+O(\\varepsilon))$-approximation in terms of the $\\ell_2$ Wasser\\-stein\ndistance. Our main result shows that the posterior distribution of Bayesian\nlinear regression is approximated up to a small error depending on only an\n$\\varepsilon$-fraction of its defining parameters. This holds when using\narbitrary Gaussian priors or the degenerate case of uniform distributions over\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ for $\\beta$. Our empirical evaluations involve different\nsimulated settings of Bayesian linear regression. Our experiments underline\nthat the proposed method is able to recover the regression model up to small\nerror while considerably reducing the total running time.","authors":["Leo N.
