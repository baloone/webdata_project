{"id":"268689471_Quantum_arithmetic_with_the_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","abstract":"The quantum Fourier transform offers an interesting way to perform arithmetic operations on a quantum computer. We review existing quantum Fourier transform adders and multipliers and comment some simple variations that extend their capabilities. These modified circuits can perform modular and non-modular arithmetic operations and work with signed integers. Among the operations, we discuss a quantum method to compute the weighted average of a series of inputs in the transform domain. One of the circuits, the controlled weighted sum, can be interpreted as a circuit to compute the inner product of two data vectors.","authors":["Lidia Ruiz PÃ©rez","Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin"],"meta":["April 2017Quantum Information Processing 16(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-017-1603-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311867061_Cost-efficient_design_of_a_quantum_multiplier-accumulator_unit","270751831_Robustness_of_the_quantum_Fourier_transform_with_respect_to_static_gate_defects","265554646_An_introduction_to_quantum_machine_learning","262974631_Quantum_arithmetic_and_numerical_analysis_using_Repeat-Until-Success_circuits","262163558_Design_of_Efficient_Reversible_Logic-Based_Binary_and_BCD_Adder_Circuits","311842521_An_n-bit_general_implementation_of_Shor's_quantum_period-finding_algorithm","300372443_Coherent_feedback_control_of_a_single_qubit_in_diamond","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","277614392_Read_the_fine_print","262368118_A_TH_n-depth_quantum_adder_on_the_2D_NTC_quantum_computer_architecture"]}
