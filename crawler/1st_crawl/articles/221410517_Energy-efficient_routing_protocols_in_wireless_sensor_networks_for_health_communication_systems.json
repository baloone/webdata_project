{"id":"221410517_Energy-efficient_routing_protocols_in_wireless_sensor_networks_for_health_communication_systems","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have their own unique nature of distributed resources and dynamic topology. This introduces very special requirements that should be met by the proposed routing protocols for the WSNs. A Wireless Sensor Network routing protocol is a standard which controls the number of nodes that come to an agreement about the way to route packets between all the computing devices in mobile wireless networks. Today, wireless networks are becoming popular and many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. Considering these protocols we made a survey on the WSNs energy-efficient routing techniques which are used for Health Care Communication Systems concerning especially the Flat Networks Protocols that have been developed in recent years. Then, as related work, we discuss each of the routing protocols belonging to this category and conclude with a comparison of them.","authors":["Nikolaos Pantazis","Stefanos A.
