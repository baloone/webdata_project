{"id":"323674966_An_intuitive_two-fluid_picture_of_spontaneous_2D_collisionless_magnetic_reconnection_and_whistler_wave_generation","abstract":"An intuitive and physical two-fluid picture of spontaneous 2D collisionless magnetic reconnection and whistler wave generation is presented in the framework of 3D electron-magnetohydrodynamics. In this regime, canonical circulation (Q=me∇×u+qeB) flux tubes can be defined in analogy to magnetic flux tubes in ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Following the 3D behavior of these Q flux tubes provides a new perspective on collisionless reconnection—a perspective that has been hard to perceive via examinations of 2D projections. This shows that even in a 2D geometry with an ignorable coordinate, a 3D examination is essential for a full comprehension of the process. Intuitive answers are given to three main questions in collisionless reconnection: why is reconnection spontaneous, why do particles accelerate extremely fast, and why are whistler waves generated? Possible extensions to other regimes are discussed.","authors":["Young Dae Yoon","Paul M.
