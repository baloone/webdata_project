{"id":"293009973_An_association_between_primitive_and_non-primitive_BCH_codes_using_monoid_rings","abstract":"BCH codes are one of the most important classes of cyclic codes for error correction. In this study, we generalize BCH codes using monoid rings instead of a polynomial ring over the binary field F 2 . We show the existence of a non-primitive binary BCH code C bn of length bn, corresponding to a given length n binary BCH code C n . The value of b is investigated for which the existence of the non-primitive BCH code C bn is assured. It is noticed that the code C n is embedded in the code C bn . Therefore, encoding and decoding of the codes C n and C bn can be done simultaneously. The data transmitted by C n can also be transmitted by C bn . The BCH code C bn has better error correction capability whereas the BCH code C n has better code rate, hence both gains can be achieved at the same time.\nMathematical subject classification: 11T71, 94B15, 94B20, 94B60.","authors":["Asma Shaheen Ansari","Tariq Shah"],"meta":["February 2016EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2016(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13638-016-0526-3"],"references":["265797545_A_Note_on_Linear_Codes_over_Semigroup_Rings","262480615_Encoding_through_generalized_polynomial_codes","257810471_A_method_for_improving_the_code_rate_and_error_correction_capability_of_a_cyclic_code","287125624_A_Decoding_Procedure_which_Improves_Code_Rate_and_Error_Corrections","268683218_Error-Correcting_Codes","267126092_Systematic_codes_using_binary_shift_register_sequences","263982529_CYCLIC_CODES_THROUGH_BXfracabmathbb_Z_0_WITH_fracabin_mathbb_Q_AND_b_a1_AND_ENCODING","263870985_CYCLIC_CODES_THROUGH_BX_BXfrac1kpZ_0_AND_BXfrac1pkZ_0_A_COMPARISON","260166037_Ring_constructions_and_applications","257312876_Constructions_of_codes_through_the_semigroup_ring_BX122Z0_and_encoding"]}
