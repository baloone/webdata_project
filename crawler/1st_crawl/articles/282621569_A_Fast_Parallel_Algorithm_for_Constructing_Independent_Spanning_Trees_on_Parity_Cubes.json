{"id":"282621569_A_Fast_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Parity_Cubes","abstract":"Zehavi and Itai (1989) proposed the following conjecture: every k-connected graph has k independent spanning trees (ISTs for short) rooted at an arbitrary node. An n-dimensional parity cube, denoted by PQn, is a variation of hypercubes with connectivity n and has many features superior to those of hypercubes. Recently, Wang et al. (2012) confirmed the ISTs conjecture by providing an algorithm to construct n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary node on PQn, where is the number of nodes in PQn. However, this algorithm is executed in a recursive fashion and thus is hard to be parallelized. In this paper, we present a non-recursive and fully parallelized approach to construct n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary node of PQn in time using N processors. In particular, the constructing rule of spanning trees is simple and the proof of independency is easier than ever before.","authors":["Yu-Huei Chang","Jinn-Shyong Yang","Jou-ming Chang","Yue-Li Wang"],"meta":["October 2015Applied Mathematics and Computation 268:489-495","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2015.06.081"],"references":["4139026_Fault-Hamiltonicity_of_Hypercube-Like_Interconnection_Networks","3299614_The_crossed_cube_architecture_for_parallel_computing","276834793_A_fully_parallelized_scheme_of_constructing_independent_spanning_trees_on_Mobius_cubes","275164336_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Cartesian_Product_of_Hybrid_Graphs","274171451_Constructive_Algorithm_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Mobius_Cubes","264719533_Three_tree-paths","257666493_Parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_and_an_application_in_diagnosis_on_Mobius_cubes","257252425_Dimension-adjacent_trees_and_parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_on_crossed_cubes","257145081_An_algorithm_to_construct_independent_spanning_trees_on_parity_cubes","256721175_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","223085074_Finding_nonseparating_induced_cycles_and_independent_spanning_trees_in_3-connected_graphs","222814706_Parallel_construction_of_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_on_hypercubes","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","220758952_The_Twisted_Cube","220618379_Finding_Four_Independent_Trees","220586101_The_Twisted-Cube_Connected_Networks","220567191_Broadcasting_secure_messages_via_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_in_folded_hypercubes","220314958_Embedding_meshes_into_twisted-cubes","220313683_Vertex-disjoint_spanning_trees_of_the_star_network_with_applications_to_fault-tolerance_and_security","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks"]}
