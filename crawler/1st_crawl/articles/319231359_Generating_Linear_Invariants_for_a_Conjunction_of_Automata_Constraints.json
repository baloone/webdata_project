{"id":"319231359_Generating_Linear_Invariants_for_a_Conjunction_of_Automata_Constraints","abstract":"We propose a systematic approach for generating linear implied constraints that link the values returned by several automata with accumulators after consuming the same input sequence. The method handles automata whose accumulators are increased by (or reset to) some non-negative integer value on each transition. We evaluate the impact of the generated linear invariants on conjunctions of two families of time-series constraints.","authors":["Ekaterina Arafailova","Nicolas Beldiceanu","Helmut Simonis"],"meta":["August 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66158-2_2","Conference: International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming"],"references":["280852131_Describing_and_Generating_Solutions_for_the_EDF_Unit_Commitment_Problem_with_the_ModelSeeker","257142486_Propagating_Regular_Counting_Constraints","230872913_Outline_of_an_Algorithm_for_Integer_Solutions_to_Linear_Programs","221633262_Deriving_Filtering_Algorithms_from_Constraint_Checkers","221632953_Graph_Invariants_as_Necessary_Conditions_for_Global_Constraints","220838036_Solving_the_Car_Sequencing_Problem_in_Constraint_Logic_Programming","306392208_Systematic_Derivation_of_Bounds_and_Glue_Constraints_for_Time-Series_Constraints","302973578_Time-Series_Constraints_Improvements_and_Application_in_CP_and_MIP_Contexts","281299324_Using_finite_transducers_for_describing_and_synthesising_structural_time-series_constraints","280791806_Automata_and_Constraint_Programming_for_Personnel_Scheduling_Problems","260750293_Integrated_Methods_for_Optimization","260749734_Integrated_Methods_for_Optimization","230669031_Sequencing_and_Counting_with_the_multicost-regular_Constraint","229058134_Convex_Optimization","223624168_Introducing_Global_Constraints_in_CHIP","222578465_Cutting_Planes_in_Integer_and_Mixed_Integer_Programming","221633539_A_Filtering_Algorithm_for_the_Stretch_Constraint","221353510_LP_Relaxations_of_Multiple_all_different_Predicates","220838230_Automatic_Generation_of_Implied_Constraints","220089053_All-Different_Polytopes","220081219_AutoGraphiX_An_Automated_System_for_Finding_Conjectures_in_Graph_Theory","2378198_Extensions_to_Proof_Planning_for_Generating_Implied_Constraints"]}
