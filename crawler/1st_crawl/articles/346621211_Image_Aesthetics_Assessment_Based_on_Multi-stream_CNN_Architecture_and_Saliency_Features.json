{"id":"346621211_Image_Aesthetics_Assessment_Based_on_Multi-stream_CNN_Architecture_and_Saliency_Features","abstract":"In this paper, we explore how higher-level perceptual information based on visual attention can be used for aesthetic assessment of images. We assume that visually dominant subjects in a photograph influence stronger aesthetic interest. In other words, visual attention may be a key to predicting photographic aesthetics. Our proposed aesthetic assessment method, which is based on multi-stream and multi-task convolutional neural networks (CNNs), extracts global features and saliency features from an input image. These provide higher-level visual information such as the quality of the photo subject and the subjectâ€“background relationship. Results from our experiments support the effectiveness of our approach.","authors":["Hironori Takimoto","Fumiya Omori","Akihiro Kanagawa"],"meta":["November 2020Applied Artificial Intelligence 35(3):1-16","DOI:10.1080/08839514.2020.1839197"],"references":["277411157_Deep_Learning","276296083_CAT2000_A_Large_Scale_Fixation_Dataset_for_Boosting_Saliency_Research","248559470_Art_The_replicable_unitAn_inquiry_into_the_possible_origin_of_art_as_a_social_behavior","228602850_Visual_categorization_with_bags_of_keypoints","221361802_Aesthetic_quality_classification_of_photographs_based_on_color_harmony","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221111820_Assessing_the_aesthetic_quality_of_photographs_using_generic_image_descriptors","221109965_Content-Based_Photo_Quality_Assessment","4246128_The_Design_of_High-Level_Features_for_Photo_Quality_Assessment","3192913_A_Model_of_Saliency-based_Visual_Attention_for_Rapid_Scene_Analysis","348068328_Attention_and_the_Aesthetic_Object","332613771_Food_Constituent_Estimation_for_Lifestyle_Disease_Prevention_by_Multi-Task_CNN","329339187_A_Multi-Stream_3D_CNN_Structure_for_Human_Action_Recognition_Trained_by_Limited_Data","326099191_Multi-stream_CNN_Learning_representations_based_on_human-related_regions_for_action_recognition","320971306_A-Lamp_Adaptive_Layout-Aware_Multi-patch_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Photo_Aesthetic_Assessment","320968382_Xception_Deep_Learning_with_Depthwise_Separable_Convolutions","319900846_NIMA_Neural_Image_Assessment","311610011_Composition-Preserving_Deep_Photo_Aesthetics_Assessment","308277797_Photo_Aesthetics_Ranking_Network_with_Attributes_and_Content_Adaptation","300412726_Deep_Multi-patch_Aggregation_Network_for_Image_Style_Aesthetics_and_Quality_Estimation","300412448_SALICON_Reducing_the_Semantic_Gap_in_Saliency_Prediction_by_Adapting_Deep_Neural_Networks","282965126_Multi-task_CNN_Model_for_Attribute_Prediction","282412995_Rating_Pictorial_Aesthetics_Using_Deep_Learning","275846005_Attention_and_the_Aesthetic_Object","275603606_Computational_Models_of_Human_Visual_Attention_and_Their_Implementations_A_Survey","261336804_AVA_A_large-scale_database_for_aesthetic_visual_analysis","224716280_Fisher_Kernels_on_Visual_Vocabularies_for_Image_Categorization","221364573_High_level_describable_attributes_for_predicting_aesthetics_and_interestingness","221304720_Studying_Aesthetics_in_Photographic_Images_Using_a_Computational_Approach","220660299_Modeling_the_Shape_of_the_Scene_A_Holistic_Representation_of_the_Spatial_Envelope","19324926_Shifts_in_Selective_Visual_Attention_Towards_the_Underlying_Neural_Circuitry","15848226_A_Feature-Integration_Theory_of_Attention"]}
