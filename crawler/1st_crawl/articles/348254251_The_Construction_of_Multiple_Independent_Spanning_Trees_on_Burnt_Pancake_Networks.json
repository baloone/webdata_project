{"id":"348254251_The_Construction_of_Multiple_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Burnt_Pancake_Networks","abstract":"A set of the spanning trees in a graph G is called independent spanning trees if they have a common root r and for each vertex v ∈ V(G)\\{r}, the paths from v to r in any two trees are directed edge-disjoint and internally vertex-disjoint. The construction of independent spanning trees has many practical applications in reliable communication networks, such as fault-tolerant transmission and secure message distribution. A burnt pancake network BPn is a kind of Cayley graph, which has been proposed as the topology of an interconnection network. In this paper, we provide a two stages construction scheme that can be used to construct a maximal number of independent spanning trees on a burnt pancake network in O(N×n) time, where N is the number of nodes of BPn and n is the dimension of the network. Furthermore, we prove the correctness of our proposed algorithm in constructing independent spanning trees.","authors":["Yi-Cheng Yang","Shih-Shun Kao","Ralf Klasing","Sun-Yuan Hsieh"],"meta":["January 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3049290"],"references":["346920048_Two_Algorithms_for_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_nk_-Star_Graphs","343496425_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Transposition_Networks","341840878_Top-Down_Construction_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Alternating_Group_Networks","341148305_Constructing_dual-CISTs_of_pancake_graphs_and_performance_assessment_of_protection_routings_on_some_Cayley_networks","338179454_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Pancake_Networks","333699968_Amortized_efficiency_of_constructing_multiple_independent_spanning_trees_on_bubble-sort_networks","341605161_Three_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Crossed_Cubes_with_Application_to_Secure-Protection_Routing","336794512_Analysis_on_component_connectivity_of_bubble-sort_star_graphs_and_burnt_pancake_graphs","335671148_Cycles_in_the_burnt_pancake_graph","332658388_Dual-CISTs_Configuring_a_Protection_Routing_on_Some_Cayley_Networks"]}
