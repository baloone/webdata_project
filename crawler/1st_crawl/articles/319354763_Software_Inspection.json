{"id":"319354763_Software_Inspection","abstract":"Software inspection is the most commonly performed software QA activity besides testing. Depending on the techniques used, software artifacts inspected, the formality of inspection, number of people involved, etc., inspection activities can be classified and examined individually, and then compared to one another. In this chapter, we discussed these issues, with a focus on the technical aspects of inspection. As a general extension, we also consider static analyses of programs and other software artifacts that can be performed similar to the ways that software inspections are performed.","authors":["Jeff Tian"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1002/0471722324.ch14","In book: Software Quality Engineering: Testing, Quality Assurance, and Quantifiable Improvement (pp.237-250)"],"references":[]}
