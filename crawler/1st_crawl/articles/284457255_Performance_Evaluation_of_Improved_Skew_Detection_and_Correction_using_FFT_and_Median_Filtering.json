{"id":"284457255_Performance_Evaluation_of_Improved_Skew_Detection_and_Correction_using_FFT_and_Median_Filtering","abstract":"paper presents a new skew detection and correction technique using FFT & median filtering. It is found that there are many techniques based on skew correction which have been proposed so far by different researchers. It has been found that the most of existing techniques introduce artifacts while doing the skew correction. So to overcome this problem an integrated approach is presented in this research work. The proposed algorithm is planned and implemented in MATLAB using Image processing toolbox. To illustrate the algorithm 25 skewed images are taken for experimental purpose. The proposed algorithm has shown quite active results than previous techniques . The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 99%.","authors":["Neha Watts","Jyoti Rani"],"meta":["August 2014International Journal of Computer Applications 100(15):7-16","DOI:10.5120/17599-8174"],"references":[]}
