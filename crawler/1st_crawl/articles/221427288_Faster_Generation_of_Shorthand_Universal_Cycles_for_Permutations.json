{"id":"221427288_Faster_Generation_of_Shorthand_Universal_Cycles_for_Permutations","abstract":"A universal cycle for the k-permutations of h ni = {1,2,...,n} is a circular string of length nk that contains each k-permutation exactly once as a substring. Jackson (Discrete Mathematics, 149 (1996) 123-129) proved their existence for all k ≤ n − 1. Knuth (The Art of Computer Program- ming, Volume 4, Fascicle 2, Addison-Wesley, 2005) pointed out the importance of the k = n − 1 case, where each (n − 1)-permutation is \"shorthand\" for exactly one permutation of h ni . Ruskey-Williams (ACM Transactions on Algorithms, in press) answered Knuth's request for an explicit construction of a shorthand universal cycle for permutations, and gave an algorithm that creates successive symbols in worst-case O(1)-time. This paper provides two new algorithmic constructions that create successive blocks of n symbols in O(1) amortized time within an array of length n. The constructions are based on a 300 year-old bell-ringer pattern, and the recent shift Gray code by Williams (SODA, (2009) 987-996) and are both implemented in C. For the bell-ringers algorithm, we show that the majority of changes between successive permutations are full rotations; asymptotically, the ratio of them is (n − 2)/n.","authors":["Alexander E.
