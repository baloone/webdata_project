{"id":"259476268_Colored_maximal_branching_process","abstract":"We consider a certain version of the multi-type maximal branching process recently\nintroduced by Lebedev. The main result of this paper is a limit theorem for empirical frequencies\nof the types. The result shows explicitly how the initial distribution of types is modiï¿½ed in the long\nrun by a mechanism of selection among competing individuals in a maximal branching process.","authors":["Ozgur Aydogmus","Arka P.
