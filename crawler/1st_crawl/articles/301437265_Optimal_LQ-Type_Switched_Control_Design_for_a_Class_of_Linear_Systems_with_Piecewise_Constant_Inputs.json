{"id":"301437265_Optimal_LQ-Type_Switched_Control_Design_for_a_Class_of_Linear_Systems_with_Piecewise_Constant_Inputs","abstract":"This paper is devoted to a specific LQ-type optimal control problem (OCP) in the presence of additional control constraints. We consider control processes governed by linear differential equations with a priori known control switchings. The piecewise constant structure of the admissible controls under consideration is motivated by variety of concrete engineering applications and moreover, can be interpreted as a result of a quantization procedure applied to the original dynamics. We propose an new implementable numeric algorithm that makes it possible to calculate a consistent approximating solution to the initial constrained LQ-type OCPs. The contribution discusses some theoretic aspects of the obtained computational scheme and also contains a numerical example.","authors":["Vadim Azhmyakov"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.3182/20140824-6-ZA-1003.00515","Conference: World Congress"],"references":["268248877_Introduction_to_optimization_Vvedenie_v_optimizatsiyu","260662187_A_Unified_Framework_for_Hybrid_Control_Model_and_Optimal_Control_Theory","258407149_Finite_Set_Control_Transcription_for_Optimal_Control_Applications","224560828_Hybrid_LQ-Optimization_Using_Dynamic_Programming","224254119_Optimization_of_multiagent_systems_with_increasing_state_dimensions_Hybrid_LQ_approach","224162367_On_the_LQ-based_optimization_techniques_for_impulsive_hybrid_control_systems","221422269_On_the_Maximum_Principle_for_Impulsive_Hybrid_Systems","220652137_A_Proximal_Point_Based_Approach_to_Optimal_Control_of_Affine_Switched_Systems","220259694_Hybrid_Necessary_Principle","4217510_Hybrid_Necessary_Principle","3116618_Applied_Optimal_Control_Optimization_Estimation_and_Control","3033066_Convex_Control_Systems_and_Convex_Optimal_Control_Problems_With_Constraints","3024015_Optimal_control_of_a_class_of_hybrid_systems","3023626_Piecewise_Linear_Quadratic_Optimal_Control","316471045_Advanced_Mathematical_Tools_for_Automatic_Control_Engineers_Volume_2","316322405_Advanced_Mathematical_Tools_for_Control_Engineers_Volume_1","278689347_The_Robust_Maximum_Principle","275970953_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","271182467_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","268247156_Infinite-Dimensional_Optimization_and_Control_Theory","245371900_Practical_Methods_for_Optimal_Control_Using_Nonlinear_Programming","245321596_Structure_and_control_of_piecewise-linear_systems","235410150_Optimal_Control_Theory","229058042_Linear_System_Theory","228979431_Lecture_notes_on_hybrid_systems","224579941_On-Line_Optimization_of_Switched-Mode_Dynamical_Systems","224367702_Sliding_mode_regulator_as_solution_to_optimal_control_problem","222545092_Hybrid_Feedback_Stabilisation_of_Systems_with_Quantized_Signals","222146105_Optimal_control_of_impulsive_hybrid_systems","221422265_The_Sensitivity_of_Hybrid_Systems_Optimal_Cost_Functions_with_Respect_to_Switching_Manifold_Parameters","220158332_LQ_Control_for_Constrained_Continuous-time_Systems","49913185_A_Unified_Computational_Approach_To_Optimal_Control_Problems","44372160_Numerical_Methods_for_Optimal_Control_Problems_With_State_Constraints","31726181_Practical_Methods_for_Optimal_Control_Using_Nonlinear_Programming_JT_Betts","3032862_On_the_Hybrid_Optimal_Control_Problem_Theory_and_Algorithms","3032748_Continuous_Time_Linear_Quadratic_Regulator_With_Control_Constraints_via_Convex_Duality","3032329_Transition-Time_Optimization_for_Switched-Mode_Dynamical_Systems","3023781_Quantized_Feedback_Stabilization_of_Linear_Systems"]}
