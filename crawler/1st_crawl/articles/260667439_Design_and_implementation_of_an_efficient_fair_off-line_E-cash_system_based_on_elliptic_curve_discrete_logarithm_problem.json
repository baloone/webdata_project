{"id":"260667439_Design_and_implementation_of_an_efficient_fair_off-line_E-cash_system_based_on_elliptic_curve_discrete_logarithm_problem","abstract":"In this paper, we design and implement an efficient fair off-line electronic cash system based on Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), in which the anonymity of coins is revocable by a trustee in case of dispute. To achieve this, we employ the Petersen and Poupard's electronic cash system [1] and extend it by using an elliptic curve over the finite field GF(2n). This naturally reduces message size by 85% compared with the original scheme and makes a smart card to store coins easily. Furthermore, we use the Baek et al.'s provably secure public key encryption scheme [2] to improve the security of electronic cash system. As an extension, we propose a method to add atomicity into new electronic cash system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to implement a fair off-line electronic cash system based on ECDLP with provable security.","authors":["Manho Lee","Gookwhan Ahn","Jinho Kim","Jaegwan Park"],"meta":["June 2002Journal of Communications and Networks 4(2):81-89","DOI:10.1109/JCN.2002.6596898"],"references":["221609923_An_Efficient_Fair_Payment_System","220905181_Money_Conservation_via_Atomicity_in_Fair_Off-Line_E-Cash","2827870_VarietyCash_a_Multi-purpose_Electronic_Payment_System","2561173_Secure_Length-Saving_ElGamal_Encryption_under_the_Computational_Diffie-Hellman_Assumption","2554568_Provably_Secure_Blind_Signature_Schemes","2360802_Anonymous_Atomic_Transactions","2336964_Chosen-Ciphertext_Security_for_Any_One-Way_Cryptosystem","313163148_An_efficient_divisible_electronic_cash_scheme","311760027_ELLIPTIC_CURVE_CRYPTOGRAPHY","292117940_Provably_secure_length-saving_public-key_encryption_scheme_under_the_computational_Diffie-Hellman_assumption","262321070_VarietyCash_a_multi-purpose_electronic_payment_system","251304961_Practical_escrow_cash_system","239579852_Privacy_protected_payments--unconditional_payer_andor_payee_untraceability","225824684_Fast_Key_Exchange_with_Elliptic_Curve_Systems","225724149_Efficient_Scalable_Fair_Cash_with_Off-line_Extortion_Prevention","225572810_Efficient_Identification_and_Signatures_for_Smart_Cards","225120519_Indirect_discourse_proofs_Achieving_efficient_Fair_Off-Line_e-cash","221355564_An_Efficient_Divisible_Electronic_Cash_Scheme","221355198_Fast_Key_Exchange_with_Elliptic_Curve_Systems","221355153_Blind_Signatures_for_Untraceable_Payments","221354999_Universal_Electronic_Cash","221354901_Untraceable_Electronic_Cash","221354651_Untraceable_Off-line_Cash_in_Wallets_with_Observers_Extended_Abstract","221348385_Fair_Blind_Signatures","221291555_Practical_Escrow_Cash_System","220614705_On_blind_signatures_and_perfect_crimes","220269506_Revokable_and_Versatile_Electronic_Money_extended_abstract","3646625_NetBill_An_Internet_commerce_system_optimized_for_networkdelivered_services","3082825_New_Directions_in_Cryptography","2825591_An_Efficient_Fair_Payment_System","2663791_Trustee-based_Tracing_Extensions_to_Anonymous_Cash_and_the_Making_of_Anonymous_Change","2606109_Untraceable_Off-line_Cash_in_Wallets_with_Observers","2581392_Digital_Payment_Systems_with_Passive_AnonymityRevoking_Trustees","2455799_Digital_Payment_Systems_with_Passive_Anonymity-Revoking_Trustees","2388114_Provably_Secure_Length-saving_Public-Key_Encryption_Scheme_under_the_Computational_Diffie-Hellman_Assumption","2313055_Atomicity_in_Electronic_Commerce","2272322_An_Efficient_Protocol_for_Authenticated_Key_Agreement"]}
