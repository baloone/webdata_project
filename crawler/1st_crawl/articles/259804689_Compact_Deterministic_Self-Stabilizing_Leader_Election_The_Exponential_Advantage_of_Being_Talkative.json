{"id":"259804689_Compact_Deterministic_Self-Stabilizing_Leader_Election_The_Exponential_Advantage_of_Being_Talkative","abstract":"This paper focuses on compact deterministic self-stabilizing solutions for\nthe leader election problem. When the protocol is required to be \\emph{silent}\n(i.e., when communication content remains fixed from some point in time during\nany execution), there exists a lower bound of Omega(\\log n) bits of memory per\nnode participating to the leader election (where n denotes the number of nodes\nin the system). This lower bound holds even in rings. We present a new\ndeterministic (non-silent) self-stabilizing protocol for n-node rings that uses\nonly O(\\log\\log n) memory bits per node, and stabilizes in O(n\\log^2 n) rounds.\nOur protocol has several attractive features that make it suitable for\npractical purposes. First, the communication model fits with the model used by\nexisting compilers for real networks. Second, the size of the ring (or any\nupper bound on this size) needs not to be known by any node. Third, the node\nidentifiers can be of various sizes. Finally, no synchrony assumption, besides\na weakly fair scheduler, is assumed. Therefore, our result shows that, perhaps\nsurprisingly, trading silence for exponential improvement in term of memory\nspace does not come at a high cost regarding stabilization time or minimal\nassumptions.","authors":["LÃ©lia Blin","Sebastien Tixeuil"],"meta":["April 2018Distributed Computing 31(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00446-017-0294-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262156291_Brief_announcement_Deterministic_self-stabilizing_leader_election_with_Ologlog_n-bits","256650364_A_Space_Optimal_Deterministic_Self-Stabilizing_Leader_Election_Algorithm_for_Unidirectional_Rings","225205843_Transient_Fault_Detectors","323433925_A_Self-Stabilizing_Memory_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum_Diameter_Spanning_Tree_under_an_Omnipotent_Daemon","285449854_Compact_Deterministic_Self-stabilizing_Leader_Election","269858936_Introduction_Self_Stabilization","262212553_Evaluating_Practical_Tolerance_Properties_of_Stabilizing_Programs_through_Simulation_The_Case_of_Propagation_of_Information_with_Feedback","243772619_Memory-efficient_and_self-stabilizing_net-work_reset","239552157_Self_stabilizing_systems_in_spite_of_distributed_control","225707516_Memory_requirements_for_silent_stabilization"]}
