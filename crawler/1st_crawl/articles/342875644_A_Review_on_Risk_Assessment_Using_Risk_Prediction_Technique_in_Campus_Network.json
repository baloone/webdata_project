{"id":"342875644_A_Review_on_Risk_Assessment_Using_Risk_Prediction_Technique_in_Campus_Network","abstract":"Risk assessment is an important part of a risk management process to secure information systems. The risk assessment activities helped organizations determine the acceptable level of risk. Understanding and assessing risk is an important process to improve information security in making decisions. Risk prediction is an important part of information security system. In order to security operation center understand their environment, risk prediction technique helped them to create a holistic understanding of the networks, systems, services and applications they are responsible for monitoring. In this research paper, we discussed past related research in doing a risk prediction in conducting a risk assessment activity at the campus network. We have selected 5 key databases in computer science area. We have refined the searching based on subject area, types of document, publication title, index terms, sub-keyword and source title. In doing the screening process, we exclude articles that did not meet research selection criteria based on keyword searching in the papers. From the comprehensive literature search databases searching, we have selected 15 articles related to subject risk prediction conducted in campus network.
