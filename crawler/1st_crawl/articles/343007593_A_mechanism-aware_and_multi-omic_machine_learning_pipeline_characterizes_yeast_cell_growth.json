{"id":"343007593_A_mechanism-aware_and_multi-omic_machine_learning_pipeline_characterizes_yeast_cell_growth","abstract":"Linking genotype and phenotype is a fundamental problem in biology, key to several biomedical and biotechnological applications. Cell growth is a central phenotypic trait, resulting from interactions between environment, gene regulation, and metabolism, yet its functional bases are still not completely understood. We propose and test a machine-learning approach that integrates large-scale gene expression profiles and mechanistic metabolic models, for characterizing cell growth and understanding its driving mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At its core, a custom-built multimodal learning method merges experimentally generated and model-generated data. We show that our approach can leverage the advantages of both machine learning and metabolic modeling, revealing unknown interactions between biological domains, incorporating mechanistic knowledge, and therefore overcoming black-box limitations of conventional data-driven approaches.","authors":["Chris Culley","Supreeta Vijayakumar","Guido Zampieri","Claudio Angione"],"meta":["July 2020Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117(31)","DOI:10.1073/pnas.2002959117"],"references":["345157487_DeepMetabolism_A_Deep_Learning_System_to_Predict_Phenotype_from_Genome_Sequencing","334408227_Machine_and_deep_learning_meet_genome-scale_metabolic_modeling","334059284_Predicting_gastrointestinal_drug_effects_using_contextualized_metabolic_models","333401862_Phospholipid_turnover_and_acyl_chain_remodeling_in_the_yeast_ER","332312043_Towards_the_network-based_prediction_of_repurposed_drugs_using_patient-specific_metabolic_models","329869151_Predicting_Growth_Rate_from_Gene_Expression","338432104_Yeast_systems_biology_in_understanding_principles_of_physiology_underlying_complex_human_diseases","336416429_Genome-Scale_Metabolic_Modeling_from_Yeast_to_Human_Cell_Models_of_Complex_Diseases_Latest_Advances_and_Challenges","332997615_A_White-Box_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Revealing_Antibiotic_Mechanisms_of_Action","331335435_Protocol_Update_for_large-scale_genome_and_gene_function_analysis_with_the_PANTHER_classification_system_v140"]}
