{"id":"343757409_A_Causal_Analysis_of_Attitude_toward_Mathematics","abstract":"A model was hypothesized in which teacher quality, social-psychological classroom climate, and management-organization classroom climate were assumed to affect a class's attitude toward mathematics and, to a lesser extent, its motivation. Path analyses of data from 28 fourth-grade, 34 seventh-grade, and 38 ninth-grade classes were employed to test the validity of the model. Support was moderately positive at Grade 4 and improved substantially at Grades 7 and 9.","authors":["Tom Haladyna","Joan Shaughnessy","J.
