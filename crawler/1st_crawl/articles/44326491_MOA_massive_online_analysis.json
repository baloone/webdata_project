{"id":"44326491_MOA_massive_online_analysis","abstract":"Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a software environment for implementing algorithms and running experiments for online learning from evolving data streams. MOA includes a collection of offline and online methods as well as tools for evaluation. In particular, it implements boosting, bagging, and Hoeffding Trees, all with and without Na√Øve Bayes classifiers at the leaves. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with WEKA, the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, and is released under the GNU GPL license.","authors":["Albert Bifet","Geoffrey Holmes","Richard Kirkby","Bernhard Pfahringer"],"meta":["May 2010Journal of Machine Learning Research 11","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234802181_Adaptive_Stream_Mining_Pattern_Learning_and_Mining_from_Evolving_Data_Streams","226461564_Improving_Adaptive_Bagging_Methods_for_Evolving_Data_Streams","221653555_Issues_in_evaluation_of_stream_learning_algorithms","44326489_New_ensemble_methods_for_evolving_data_streams","33052497_Improving_Hoeffding_Trees","33051928_Handling_Numeric_Attributes_in_Hoeffding_Trees"]}
