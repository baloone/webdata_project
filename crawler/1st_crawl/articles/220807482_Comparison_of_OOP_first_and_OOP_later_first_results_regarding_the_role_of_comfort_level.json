{"id":"220807482_Comparison_of_OOP_first_and_OOP_later_first_results_regarding_the_role_of_comfort_level","abstract":"This paper is the second part of an empirical comparison of objects-first vs. objects-later. Here we focus on the role of the emotional climate, connected to the different approaches. The study was carefully designed to align the two approaches so that the comparison is focused on the main difference; that is the different sequence in which topics are taught: object oriented topics from the beginning or not. The study with duration of one year was carried out in a secondary school. Both groups showed a high comfort level, the same increase in learning gain, but perceived the difficulty of topics differently. We discuss pedagogical implications.","authors":["Albrecht Ehlert","Carsten Schulte"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1145/1822090.1822122","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 15th Annual SIGCSE Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 2010, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey, June 26-30, 2010"],"references":["228579475_A_Competence_Model_for_Object_Interaction_in_Introductory_Programming","221538787_Programming_Factors_that_Influence_Success","221537235_Contributing_to_success_in_an_introductory_computer_science_course_A_study_of_twelve_factors","221222893_Student_motivation_and_positive_impressions_of_computing_subjects","220613151_Research_perspectives_on_the_objects-early_debate","220422564_Pair_programming_improves_student_retention_confidence_and_program_quality","220094513_Communication_in_computer_science_classrooms_Understanding_defensive_climates_as_a_means_of_creating_supportive_behaviors","2920892_Defensive_Climate_in_the_Computer_Science_Classroom","228675359_Factors_affecting_the_success_of_non-majors_in_learning_to_program","221537652_Houston_we_have_a_problem_There's_a_leak_in_the_CS1_affective_oxygen_tank","221209635_Empirical_comparison_of_objects-first_and_objects-later"]}
