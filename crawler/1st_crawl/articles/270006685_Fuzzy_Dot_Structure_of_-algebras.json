{"id":"270006685_Fuzzy_Dot_Structure_of_-algebras","abstract":"In this paper, the notions of fuzzy dot subalgebras is introduced together with fuzzy normal dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals of -algebras. The homomorphic image and inverse image are investigated in fuzzy dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals of -algebras. Also, the notion of fuzzy relations on the family of fuzzy dot subalgebras and fuzzy dot ideals of -algebras are introduced with some related properties.","authors":["Tapan Senapati","Monoranjan Bhowmik","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["September 2014Fuzzy Information and Engineering 42"],"references":[]}
