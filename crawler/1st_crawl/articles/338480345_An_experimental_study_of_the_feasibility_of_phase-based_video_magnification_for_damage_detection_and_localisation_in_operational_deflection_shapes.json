By comparing the dynamic responses resulting from both damaged and undamaged elements, structural health monitoring can be carried out, similarly as with mounted transducers. Unlike the physical sensors, which provide point‐wise measurements and a limited number of output channels, high‐quality video recording allows very spatially dense information. Moreover, video acquisition is a noncontact technique. This guarantees that any anomaly in the dynamic behaviour can be more easily correlated to damage and not to added mass or stiffness due to the installed sensors. However, in real‐life scenarios, the vibrations due to environmental input are often so small that they are indistinguishable from measurement noise if conventional image‐based techniques are applied. In order to improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio in low‐amplitude measurements, phase‐based motion magnification has been recently proposed. This study intends to show that model‐based structural health monitoring can be performed on modal data and time histories processed with phase‐based motion magnification, whereas unamplified vibrations would be too small for being successfully exploited. All the experiments were performed on a multidamaged box beam with different damage sizes and angles.","authors":["Marco Civera","Luca Zanotti Fragonara","Cecilia Surace"],"meta":["January 2020Strain 56(2)","DOI:10.1111/str.12336"],"references":["333638795_Video_Processing_Techniques_for_the_Contactless_Investigation_of_Large_Oscillations","333255511_Using_Video_Processing_for_the_Full-Field_Identification_of_Backbone_Curves_in_Case_of_Large_Vibrations","332491445_Inspection_of_Aircraft_Wing_Panels_Using_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","331565675_Advances_in_Computer_Vision-Based_Civil_Infrastructure_Inspection_and_Monitoring","328751919_Novelty_Detection_in_a_Cantilever_Beam_using_Extreme_Function_Theory","325595059_4D_surface_kinematics_monitoring_through_terrestrial_radar_interferometry_and_image_cross-correlation_coupling","324387629_Learning-Based_Video_Motion_Magnification","320935189_Computer_vision_for_SHM_of_civil_infrastructure_From_dynamic_response_measurement_to_damage_detection_-_A_review","320439798_Motion_microscopy_for_visualizing_and_quantifying_small_motions","319770629_Eulerian_Video_Magnification_for_Revealing_Subtle_Changes_in_the_World"]}
