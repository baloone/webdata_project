{"id":"305719522_Networked_Robots","abstract":"As of 2013, almost all robots have access to computer networks that offer extensive computing, memory, and other resources that can dramatically improve performance. The underlying enabling framework is the focus of this chapter: networked robots. Networked robots trace their origin to telerobots or remotely controlled robots. Telerobots are widely used to explore undersea terrains and outer space, to defuse bombs and to clean up hazardous waste. Until 1994, telerobots were accessible only to trained and trusted experts through dedicated communication channels. This chapter will describe relevant network technology, the history of networked robots as it evolves from teleoperation to cloud robotics, properties of networked robots, how to build a networked robot, example systems. Later in the chapter, we focus on the recent progress on cloud robotics, and topics for future research.","authors":["Dezhen Song","Kenneth Yigael Goldberg","Nak Young Chong"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1_44"],"references":["261418352_Estimating_part_tolerance_bounds_based_on_adaptive_Cloud-based_grasp_planning_with_slip","257567676_An_Evaluation_of_the_Cost_and_Performance_of_Scientific_Workflows_on_Amazon_EC2","254463742_Micro_Perceptual_Human_Computation_for_Visual_Tasks","254059666_Cloud_networked_robotics","254044335_Socially-Driven_Collective_Path_Planning_for_Robot_Missions","254041032_The_RoboEarth_language_Representing_and_exchanging_knowledge_about_actions_objects_and_environments","254008113_A_Performance_Evaluation_of_Azure_and_Nimbus_Clouds_for_Scientific_Applications","254006743_Performance_evaluation_of_amazon_EC2_for_NASA_HPC_applications","241638237_Cloud_Robotics_Architecture_Challenges_and_Applications","241632560_Toward_Cloud-Based_Grasping_with_Uncertainty_in_Shape_Estimating_Lower_Bounds_on_Achieving_Force_Closure_with_Zero-Slip_Push_Grasps","239763474_A_Robot_Path_Planning_Framework_that_Learns_from_Experience","239763436_Pose_error_robust_grasping_from_contact_wrench_space_metrics","234328703_The_servicing_aid_tool_A_teleoperated_robotics_system_for_space_applications","234035789_The_KIT_object_models_database_An_object_model_database_for_object_recognition_localization_and_manipulation_in_service_robotics","233640191_Improving_ability_of_tele-operators_to_complete_progressively_more_difficult_mobile_robot_paths_using_simple_expert_systems_and_ultrasonic_sensors","231061811_Belle_Monte-Carlo_Production_on_the_Amazon_EC2_Cloud","228572079_Towards_Reliable_Grasping_and_Manipulation_in_Household_Environments","226116657_Data-driven_grasping","225616278_Systems_control_models_and_codec_for_collaborative_observation_of_remote_environments_with_an_autonomous_networked_robotic_camera","225199699_Systems_and_algorithms_for_autonomous_and_scalable_crowd_surveillance_using_robotic_PTZ_cameras_assisted_by_a_wide-angle_camera","224705689_OOPS_for_Motion_Planning_An_Online_Open-source_Programming_System","224611227_3-D_perception_and_modeling","303138182_ROS_An_open-source_Robot_Operating_System","289051717_Range_change_among_new_world_tropical_and_subtropical_birds","279887974_Working_for_Free_Motivations_for_Participating_in_Open-Source_Projects","268393887_A_Mobile-Cloud_Pedestrian_Crossing_Guide_for_the_Blind","261416184_Cloud-based_robot_grasping_with_the_google_object_recognition_engine","261416016_Rapyuta_The_RoboEarth_Cloud_Engine","260289014_Learning_grasp_stability","256123377_On_man-Machine_control","254041441_Parallel_teleoperation_of_holographic_optical_tweezers_using_multi-touch_user_interface","254041346_Online_identification_of_quality_of_teleoperator_QoT_for_performance_improvement_of_telerobotic_operations","251170656_A_Webcam_as_Recording_Device_for_Light_Microscopes","250802010_Industrial_Manipulators","245584689_Beyond_the_Web_Manipulating_the_physical_world_via_the_WWW","245040406_A_research_methodology_for_tele-surgery_with_time_delays","244149480_Systems_and_Algorithms_for_Collaborative_Teleoperation","243764617_Robot_teleoperation_via_www","243764159_A_last_long_look_at_titanic","242277286_A_Networked_Telerobotic_Observatory_for_Collaborative_Remote_Observation_of_Avian_Activity_and_Range_Change","239443282_Robust_Scalable_Recognition_with_a_Vocabulary_Tree","239064837_Telerobotics_Automation_and_Human_Supervisory_Control","236486862_Electronically_controlled_manipulator","235301501_Internet-based_robotic_systems_for_teleoperation","233830217_Raven-II_An_Open_Platform_for_Surgical_Robotics_Research","233619576_A_CORBA-based_cooperative_mobile_robot_system","233593471_Robots_for_monitoring_the_environment","231337304_A_Software_Framework_based_on_Real-Time_CORBA_for_Telerobotic_Systems","226903754_Vehicle_Teleoperation_Interfaces","224669072_A_new_micro-teleoperation_system_employing_a_hand-held_force-feedback_pencil","224567977_Grasping_known_objects_with_humanoid_robots_A_box-based_approach","224503394_Executive_decision_support","224557103_LineScout_Technology_From_inspection_to_robotic_maintenance_on_live_transmission_power_lines","224343435_Mobile_robotic_teleguide_based_on_video_images","224343433_From_remote_tool_to_shared_roles"]}
