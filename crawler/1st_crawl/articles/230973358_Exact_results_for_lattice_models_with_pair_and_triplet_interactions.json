{"id":"230973358_Exact_results_for_lattice_models_with_pair_and_triplet_interactions","abstract":"Considers an Ising model and the related lattice gas on the Kagome lattice with two- and three-site couplings. Using a transformation which effectively decimates the triplet interactions, the authors determine the exact phase diagram of the Ising model as well as the exact boundary of the two-phase region of the lattice gas.","authors":["X N Wu","F Y Wu"],"meta":["January 1999Journal of Physics A Mathematical and General 22(21):L1031","DOI:10.1088/0305-4470/22/21/011"],"references":["260578378_Exact_Solution_of_an_Ising_Model_with_Three-Spin_Interactions_on_a_Triangular_Lattice","256309922_Order-Disorder_in_Hexagonal_Lattices","243541604_On_the_Spontaneous_Magnetizations_of_Honeycomb_and_Kagome_Ising_Lattices","241621473_Eight-vertex_model_on_the_honeycomb_lattice","239631938_Phase_diagram_of_the_triangular_Ising_antiferromagnet","238918615_Critical_properties_of_spins_with_pair_and_triplet_interactions_on_a_triangular_lattice","234511084_Ising_Model_on_a_Triangular_Lattice_with_Three-spin_Interactions_I_The_Eigenvalue_Equation","227149710_Blume-Emery-Griffiths_model_on_the_honeycomb_lattice","200104921_Statistical_Theory_of_Equations_of_State_and_Phase_Transitions_II_Lattice_Gas_and_Ising_Model"]}
