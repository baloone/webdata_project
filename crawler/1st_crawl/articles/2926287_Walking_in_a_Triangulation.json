{"id":"2926287_Walking_in_a_Triangulation","abstract":"The performance of walking in triangulation in the plane or tetrahedralization in 3-space was analyzed with different strategies of the theoretical and practical points. Four strategies for walking in a triangulation are the straight walk, the visibility walk with or without memory and the orthogonal walk. The stochastic visibility walk performed better experimentally than straight and the orthogonal walks. The orthogonal walk was considered when an expensive arithmetic was used or when large number of simplices should be traversed. Some experimental results on the implementation of different strategies are also provided.","authors":["Olivier Devillers","Sylvain Pion","Monique Teillaud","Thme Gnie Logiciel"],"meta":["March 2001International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science","DOI:10.1145/378583.378643","SourceOAI"],"references":["225386633_A_Note_on_Point_Location_in_Delaunay_Triangulations_of_Random_Points","220688777_LEDA_-_A_Platform_for_Combinatorial_and_Geometric_Computing","254227367_Triangulation_de_Delaunay_et_metrique_riemannienne_Applications_aux_maillages_elements_finis","247572109_Software_for_C1_Surface_Interpolation","242473725_Triangulation_de_Delaunay_et_arbres_multidimensionnels","226164212_An_acyclicity_theorem_for_cell_complex_in_d_dimension","222881949_Intersections_with_random_geometric_objects","221589830_Simple_Traversal_of_a_Subdivision_Without_Extra_Storage","220983907_Improved_Incremental_Randomized_Delaunay_Triangulation","220983863_Fast_Randomized_Point_Location_without_Preprocessing_in_Two-_and_Three-Dimensional_Delaunay_Triangulations"]}
