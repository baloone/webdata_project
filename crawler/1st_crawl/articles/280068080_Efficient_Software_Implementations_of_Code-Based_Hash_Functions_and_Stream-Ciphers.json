{"id":"280068080_Efficient_Software_Implementations_of_Code-Based_Hash_Functions_and_Stream-Ciphers","abstract":"In this work, we present a survey on software implementations of two families of cryptographic primitives based on the syndrome decoding problem: hash functions and stream ciphers. We have studied different algorithms, namely, FSB, SFSB, RFSB, SYND, 2SC and XSYND, and tried to improve their performances as software implementations which are done in C language by Using XMM registers from Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). We provide a fair comparison of the implementations of those primitives in the same platform and also give links to the codes we have developed. Although we did not reach the speed given in the paper in some cases, we managed to beat the results of the reference implementations when they are available.","authors":["Pierre-Louis Cayrel","Mohammed Meziani","Ousmane Ndiaye","Quentin Santos"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-16277-5_11","Conference: International Workshop on the Arithmetic of Finite Fields"],"references":["262275982_Improving_the_Performance_of_the_SYND_Stream_Cipher","224319898_SYND_a_Fast_Code-Based_Stream_Cipher_with_a_Security_Reduction","221355342_A_Certified_Digital_Signature","221354712_A_Design_Principle_for_Hash_Functions","220850029_S-FSB_An_improved_variant_of_the_FSB_hash_family","220849961_2SC_An_Efficient_Code-Based_Stream_Cipher","321613750_Information_Security_and_Assurance_International_Conference_ISA_2011_Brno_Czech_Republic_August_15-17_2011_Proceedings","235223677_Progress_in_Cryptology_-_AFRICACRYPT_2012_-_5th_International_Conference_on_Cryptology_in_Africa_Ifrance_Morocco_July_10-12_2012_Proceedings","221462189_Really_Fast_Syndrome-Based_Hashing","221347932_An_Efficient_Pseudo-Random_Generator_Provably_as_Secure_as_Syndrome_Decoding"]}
