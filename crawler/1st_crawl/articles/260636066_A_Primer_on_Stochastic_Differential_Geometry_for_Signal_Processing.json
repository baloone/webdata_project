{"id":"260636066_A_Primer_on_Stochastic_Differential_Geometry_for_Signal_Processing","abstract":"This primer explains how continuous-time stochastic processes (precisely, Brownian motion and other It√¥ diffusions) can be defined and studied on manifolds. No knowledge is assumed of either differential geometry or continuous-time processes. The arguably dry approach is avoided of first introducing differential geometry and only then introducing stochastic processes; both areas are motivated and developed jointly.","authors":["Jonathan H.
