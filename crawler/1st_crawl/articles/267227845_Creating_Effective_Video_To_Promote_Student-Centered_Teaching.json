{"id":"267227845_Creating_Effective_Video_To_Promote_Student-Centered_Teaching","abstract":"Training and investing teachers at all career levels in student-centered prac-tices is widely recognized as a significant challenge (Anderson, 1989; Spillane & Zeuli, 1999). Teacher resistance to educational reform has been well documented for decades (Cohen, 1989, 1990; Cuban, 1988), and mathematics teaching seems particularly impervious. Various studies document the failure of student-centered teaching practices to take hold inK -12 mathematics classrooms in significant ways, including collaborative work, (Jacobs, Hiebert, Givvin, Hollingsworth, Garnier, & Wearne, 2006); problems that are cognitively demanding or that encourage connec-tions (Jacobs, et al., 2006; Stein, Smith, Henningsen, & Silver, 1999), inquiry-based approaches (Weiss, Pasley, Smith, Banilower, & Heck,.2003); teacher questioning Julie Gainsburg i's an assistant professor in the Department of Secondary Education in the Michael D. to enhance student understanding (Spillane & Zeuli, 1999; Weiss, et al., 2003); classroom-based perfor-mance assessments (Borko, Mayfield, Marion, Flexer, & Cumbo, 1997); and student choice (Jacobs, et al., 2006). While pre-service math-teacher education is not solely to blame for this failure, it is also the case that pre-service training has been relatively unsuccess-ful at promoting nontraditional teaching practices in new mathematics teachers, in spite of the efforts and intentions of university-based teacher educators.","authors":["Julie Gainsburg"],"meta":[],"references":["254840333_Using_Video_to_Support_Teachers'_Ability_to_Notice_Classroom_Interactions","234735339_Using_Video_Clubs_To_Support_Conversations_among_Teachers_and_Researchers","234696579_Does_Eighth-Grade_Mathematics_Teaching_in_the_United_States_Align_with_the_NCTM_Standards_Results_from_the_TIMSS_1995_and_1999_Video_Studies","228568138_Using_Video_Surveys_to_Compare_Classrooms_and_Teaching_Across_Cultures_Examples_and_Lessons_From_the_TIMSS_Video_Studies","284255324_The_Project_on_the_Next_Generation_of_Teachers_Why_new_teachers_leaveand_why_new_teachers_stay","272580472_Efficacy_and_Teaching_Mathematics_by_Telling_A_Challenge_for_Reform","258510726_Implementing_standards-based_mathematics_instruction_A_casebook_for_professional_development_First_Edition","255565459_R_Cumbo_K_1997_Teachers'_developing_ideas_and_practices_about_mathematics_performance_assessment_Successes_stumbling_blocks_and","254075051_Using_Knowledge_of_Children's_Mathematics_Thinking_in_Classroom_Teaching_An_Experimental_Study","249704297_Washing_Our_Students_Clean_Internal_Conflicts_in_Response_to_Preservice_Teachers'_Beliefs_and_Practices","249054746_I_never_saw_that_before_A_deeper_view_of_video_analysis_in_teacher_education","247702047_Teaching_Practice_Plus_Que_Ca_Change","245891210_Designing_Groupwork_Strategies_for_the_Heterogeneous_Classroom","242432089_Developing_Practice_Developing_Practitioners_Toward_a_Practice-Based_Theory_of_Professional_Education","240723143_Reform_and_Teaching_Exploring_Patterns_of_Practice_in_the_Context_of_National_and_State_Mathematics_Reforms","239667281_A_Revolution_in_One_Classroom_The_Case_of_Mrs_Oublier","237785582_Connecting_the_University_with_a_Professional_Development_School_Pre-service_Teachers'_Attitudes_Toward_the_Use_of_Compressed_Video","234715900_On_the_Nature_of_Teaching_and_Assessing_Mathematical_Power_and_Mathematical_Thinking","223772595_Video_cases_and_the_development_of_meaning_making_in_preservice_teachers","223299042_The_role_of_a_children's_mathematical_thinking_experience_in_the_preparation_of_prospective_elementary_school_teachers"]}
