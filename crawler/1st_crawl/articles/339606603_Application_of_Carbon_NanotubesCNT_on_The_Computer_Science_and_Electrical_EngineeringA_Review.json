{"id":"339606603_Application_of_Carbon_NanotubesCNT_on_The_Computer_Science_and_Electrical_EngineeringA_Review","abstract":"In recent years, dimensions and sizes of components and parts in the\ncomputer and electronic industries have been steadily reducing, as they are\nnow considered very tiny tools and there is always a need to store and\nprocess information stronger. Nanotubes have poor magnetic properties. If\nnanotubes are covered by ferromagnetic nanoparticles, their magnetic\nproperties can be improved and they can be used in the manufacture of\nnanoelectronic devices in the computer and electronic industries. In addition\nto reviewing the structure and properties of materials made using different\nnanomaterials for use in the computer and electronic industries, the present\npaper aimed to study different applications of nanomaterials, especially\ncarbon nanotubes, in the manufacture of electronic devices. The present\nstudy showed that the corporation of nanomaterials into electronic devices is\na promising approach for future applications which can revolutionize the\ncomputer industry.","authors":["Hossein Kardan","Mohamad Reza Maraki","Amir Rajaei"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Reconfigurable and Embedded Systems (IJRES) 9(1):61","DOI:10.11591/ijres.v9.i1.pp61-82"],"references":["339875251_Introduction_to_Graphene-_Based_Nanomaterials","299446618_Free_Vibrations_Analysis_of_Functionally_Graded_Rectangular_Nano-plates_based_on_Nonlocal_Exponential_Shear_Deformation_Theory","321714774_Performance_Evaluation_of_CNTFET-based_Logic_Gates_using_Verilog-AMS","321714612_Design_of_Transmission_Gate_Logic_Circuits_using_Carbon_Nanotube_Field_Effect_Transistors","317402628_Graphene-based_Patch_Antenna_Tunable_in_the_Three_Atmospheric_Windows","315119393_Enhancing_Purcell's_factor_of_plasmonic_bowtie_nano-antennas_for_quantum_dot_emitters_of_InGaNGaN_in_green_band","309105619_Absorption_and_scattering_of_light_by_small_particles","297884649_Electrochemical_properties_of_carbon_nanotubes","290509821_Preparation_and_characterization_of_Fe3O4-CNTs_magnetic_nanocomposites_for_potential_application_in_functional_magnetic_printing_ink","287612550_Carbon_Nanotube_and_Graphene_Device_Physics"]}
