{"id":"317667471_Exploring_the_double_influence_of_CEOs'_management_style_on_the_development_of_SMEs'_corporate_reputation","abstract":"The research looks at the crucial role of CEOs in the development of the corporate reputation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A quantitative survey of 246 SMEs shows first the direct influence of management style (MS) on corporate reputation. The results also highlight an indirect influence of MS on corporate reputation through strategic orientation and the non-influence of information technology capabilities. This study contributes to the field by studying the influence of MS within the context of small-scale business from a non-US perspective. It also completes current research on the antecedents of corporate reputation.","authors":["Vincent Dutot"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Small Business & Entrepreneurship 29(6):1-24","DOI:10.1080/08276331.2017.1339540"],"references":["329816887_Strategic_Orientation_of_the_Firm_and_New_Product_Performance","329261641_Market_Orientation_The_Construct_Research_Propositions_and_Managerial_Implications","329261404_The_Effect_of_a_Market_Orientation_on_Business_Profitability","328132211_The_Reputational_Landscape","325001492_What's_in_a_Name_Reputation_Building_and_Corporate_Strategy","324996980_Corporate_Social_Performance_And_Organizational_Attractiveness_To_Prospective_Employees","324989121_Product_Development_Tensions_Exploring_Contrasting_Styles_of_Project_Management","312673071_PLS-SEM_indeed_a_silver_bullet","309013664_From_strategic_orientation_to_social_media_orientation_Improving_SMEs'_performance_on_social_media","307938836_Competitive_strategy_and_performance_of_family_businesses_moderating_effect_of_managerial_and_innovative_capabilities"]}
