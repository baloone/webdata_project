{"id":"301647527_A_revised_Moore_bound_for_mixed_graphs","abstract":"The degree-diameter problem seeks to find the maximum possible order of a graph with\na given (maximum) degree and diameter. It is known that graphs attaining the maximum\npossible value (the Moore bound) are extremely rare, but much activity is focused on finding\nnew examples of graphs or families of graph with orders approaching the bound as closely\nas possible. There has been recent interest in this problem as it applies to mixed graphs, in which\nwe allow some of the edges to be undirected and some directed. A 2008 paper of Nguyen\nand Miller derived an upper bound on the possible number of vertices of such graphs. We\nshow that for diameters larger than three, this bound can be reduced and we present a\ncorrected Moore bound for mixed graphs, valid for all diameters and for all combinations\nof undirected and directed degrees.\n\nFree access to article, valid for 50 days, until June 15, 2016\nhttp://authors.elsevier.com/a/1SxYW,H-c7MQ9","authors":["Dominique Buset","Mourad El Amiri","Grahame Erskine","Mirka Miller"],"meta":["March 2016Discrete Mathematics 339(8):2066-2069","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2016.03.005","Project: Degree/Diameter Problem"],"references":["272360397_New_mixed_Moore_graphs_and_directed_strongly_regular_graphs","272200855_Properties_of_mixed_Moore_graphs_of_directed_degree_one","265730705_Mixed_Moore_Cayley_graphs","222862556_On_mixed_Moore_graphs","220193937_Moore_bound_for_mixed_networks","216545811_Moore_graphs_and_beyond_A_survey_of_the_degreediameter_problem"]}
