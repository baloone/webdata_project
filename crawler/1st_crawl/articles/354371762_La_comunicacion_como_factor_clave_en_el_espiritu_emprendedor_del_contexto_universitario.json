{"id":"354371762_La_comunicacion_como_factor_clave_en_el_espiritu_emprendedor_del_contexto_universitario","abstract":"To promote a culture of entrepreneurship, the university must contribute to the formation of professionals with ethical, responsible and entrepreneurial values. In this sense, two conceptual categories emerge: communication and entrepreneurship. Communication is, currently, a polysemic category, since its study is not exclusive to one particular science but to several. Its role is decisive in university entrepreneurship, a capacity that promotes the creative transformation of the environment in order to favor local development. This is manifested in the search for innovative solutions to problems from a high perception of risk, which guarantees the systematic production of goods and services, in accordance with social demands. Therefore, the basic objective of the article is to promote a culture of entrepreneurship from the university and the different processes in which it interacts, where communication is the essence and way to do it.","authors":["Yurien Lazo Fernández","Máryuri García González","Anamarys Rojas Murillo"],"meta":["December 2020"],"references":[]}
