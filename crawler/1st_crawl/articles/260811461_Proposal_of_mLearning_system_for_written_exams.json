{"id":"260811461_Proposal_of_mLearning_system_for_written_exams","abstract":"Anyone who has gone to a college or a high school in the last decade (or more) probably knows what the eLearning is. With the rise of Internet and affordable Internet-capable devices, lots of universities and schools provide even more eLearning materials than the classic ones. With the rise of smartphones and tablets the trend has gone mobile. Therefore, several millions pages of educational material can be stored on a smartphone, or easily accessed on the online repository. However, exam part of the curriculum is not very well adapted to this new technology. This paper proposes a mLearning system that will utilize smartphones and make them useful for student on exams without the risk of student cheating.","authors":["Luka Horvat","Josip Balen","Goran Martinovic"],"meta":["January 2012","Conference: ELMAR, 2012 Proceedings"],"references":["316884978_eLearning_A_Social_Software_in_Higher_Education_Learning","262367952_M-learning-a_new_stage_of_e-learning","258341923_Students'_Awareness_and_Requirements_of_Mobile_Learning_Services_in_the_Higher_Education_Environment","238764142_MOBILE_LEARNING_THE_NEXT_GENERATION_OF_LEARNING","228412876_Web_services_architecture_for_m-learning"]}
