{"id":"318187079_Educational_data_mining_applications_and_tasks_A_survey_of_the_last_10_years","abstract":"Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the field of using data mining techniques in educational environments. There exist various methods and applications in EDM which can follow both applied research objectives such as improving and enhancing learning quality, as well as pure research objectives, which tend to improve our understanding of the learning process. In this study we have studied various tasks and applications existing in the field of EDM and categorized them based on their purposes. We have compared our study with other existing surveys about EDM and reported a taxonomy of task.","authors":["Behdad Bakhshinategh","Osmar R.
