{"id":"317491220_Unified_study_of_Quality_of_Service_QoS_in_OPSOBS_networks","abstract":"With the growth of Internet traffic, an inevitable use of optical networks provide a large bandwidth, fast data transmission rates and Quality of Service (QoS) support. Currently, Optical Burst Switched (OBS)/Optical Packet Switched (OPS) networks are under study as future solutions for addressing the increase demand of Internet traffic. However, due to their high blocking probability in the intermediate nodes they have been delayed in the industries. Packet loss in OBS/OPS networks is mainly occur due to contention. Hence, the contribution of this study is to analyze the file loss ratio (FLR), packet overhead and number of disjoint paths, and processing delay over Coded Packet Transport (CPT) scheme for OBS/OPS network using simulation. The simulations show that CPT scheme reduces the FLR in OBS/OPS network for the evaluated scenarios since the data packets are chopped off into blocks of the data packet for transmission over a network. Simulation results for secrecy and survivability are verified with the help of the analytical model to define the operational range of CPT scheme.","authors":["Gebrehiwet Gebrekrstos Lema","Dawit Hadush Hailu"],"meta":["June 2017Optical Fiber Technology 36(July 2017):394â€“402","DOI:10.1016/j.yofte.2017.05.016","Project: Mobile Fronthual networks"],"references":["300416055_Coded_Packet_Transport_for_Optical_PacketBurst_Switched_Networks","250634184_Offset_time_decision_OTD_algorithm_for_guaranteeing_the_requested_QoS_of_high_priority_traffic_in_OBS_networks","3945125_Burst_segmentation_An_approach_for_reducing_packet_loss_in_optical_burst-switched_networks","3235778_The_European_IST_project_DAVID_a_viable_approach_toward_optical_packet_switching","3196414_The_application_of_optical_packet_switching_in_future_communication_networks","308671970_Secure_burst_control_packet_scheme_for_Optical_Burst_Switching_networks","297676914_A_Novel_Elliptical-Cylindrical_Antenna_Array_for_Radar_Applications","3958830_Performance_analysis_of_deflection_routing_in_optical_burst-switched_networks","3282783_Optical_Burst_Switching_A_Viable_Solution_for_Terabit_IP_Backbone","3196752_Evolving_Toward_the_Next-Generation_Internet_Challenges_in_the_Path_Forward"]}
