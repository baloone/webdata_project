{"id":"2282279_Collage-One_A_system_for_evaluation_and_visualization_of_collage_grammars","abstract":". Collage-One is a system for evaluating and visualizing collage grammars, which are rule-based picture-generating devices of a context-free type. Pictures are represented as collages that consist of coloured parts, and they are derived by applying rules to collages, thereby producing pictures that get more and more detailed. Collage-One provides a textual and graphical collage grammar editor, an evaluator of derivations, and a display of the derived pictures. Key words. Collage grammar, visualization, picture generation 1. Introduction One encounters quite a variety of rule-based and syntactic approaches to picture generation in the literature like shape grammars, cellular automata, chain-code picture languages, and L-systems with turtle interpretation (see, e.g., [3, 1, 4, 8, 2]). Also iterated function systems [6, 10], which are prominently used in fractal geometry, may be seen in this context. This paper is concerned with collage grammars as introduced by Habel, Kreowski, and Tau...","authors":["Frank Drewes","Hans-Joerg Kreowski","N.
