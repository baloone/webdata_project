{"id":"275588147_Theory_of_Semi-Instantiation_in_Abstract_Argumentation","abstract":"We study instantiated abstract argumentation frames of the form $(S,R,I)$,\nwhere $(S,R)$ is an abstract argumentation frame and where the arguments $x$ of\n$S$ are instantiated by $I(x)$ as well formed formulas of a well known logic,\nfor example as Boolean formulas or as predicate logic formulas or as modal\nlogic formulas. We use the method of conceptual analysis to derive the\nproperties of our proposed system. We seek to define the notion of complete\nextensions for such systems and provide algorithms for finding such extensions.\nWe further develop a theory of instantiation in the abstract, using the\nframework of Boolean attack formations and of conjunctive and disjunctive\nattacks. We discuss applications and compare critically with the existing\nrelated literature.","authors":["Dov Gabbay"],"meta":["December 2016Logica Universalis 10(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11787-015-0133-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265694884_Sequent-Based_Argumentation_for_Normative_Reasoning","265694878_Dynamic_Derivations_for_Sequent-Based_Logical_Argumentation","346469251_Elements_of_Argumentation","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","282998906_Theory_of_disjunctive_attacks_Part_I","282403390_The_Attack_as_Intuitionistic_Negation","279952015_Equational_approach_to_argumentation_networks","270150099_IMM_Introduction_to_metamathematics","268671885_Revisiting_Abstract_Argumentation_Frameworks","266314285_Compromise_Update_and_Revision_A_Position_Paper","265373486_The_Equational_Approach_to_Contrary-to-duty_Obligations","265366904_Labelled_Deductive_Systems","262869122_The_ASPIC_framework_for_structured_argumentation_A_tutorial","262278521_Abduction_in_Labelled_Deductive_Systems","262174956_An_Equational_Approach_to_Logic_Programming"]}
