{"id":"305067383_Enquiring_Minds_Early_Detection_of_Rumors_in_Social_Media_from_Enquiry_Posts","abstract":"Many previous techniques identify trending topics in social media, even topics that are not pre-defined. We present a technique to identify trending rumors, which we define as topics that include disputed factual claims. Putting aside any attempt to assess whether the rumors are true or false, it is valuable to identify trending rumors as early as possible. It is extremely difficult to accurately classify whether every individual post is or is not making a disputed factual claim. We are able to identify trending rumors by recasting the problem as finding entire clusters of posts whose topic is a disputed factual claim.\nThe key insight is that when there is a rumor, even though most posts do not raise questions about it, there may be a few that do. If we can find signature text phrases that are used by a few people to express skepticism about factual claims and are rarely used to express anything else, we can use those as detectors for rumor clusters. Indeed, we have found a few phrases that seem to be used exactly that way, including: \"Is this true?\", \"Really?\", and \"What?\". Relatively few posts related to any particular rumor use any of these enquiry phrases, but lots of rumor diffusion processes have some posts that do and have them quite early in the diffusion.\nWe have developed a technique based on searching for the enquiry phrases, clustering similar posts together, and then collecting related posts that do not contain these simple phrases. We then rank the clusters by their likelihood of really containing a disputed factual claim. The detector, which searches for the very rare but very informative phrases, combined with clustering and a classifier on the clusters, yields surprisingly good performance. On a typical day of Twitter, about a third of the top 50 clusters were judged to be rumors, a high enough precision that human analysts might be willing to sift through them.","authors":["Zhe Zhao","Paul Resnick","Qiaozhu Mei"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1145/2736277.2741637","Conference: the 24th International Conference"],"references":["290110343_Detecting_Event_Rumors_on_Sina_Weibo_Automatically","286593546_100_per_RT_BostonMarathon_PrayForBoston_Analyzing_fake_content_on_Twitter","271556435_Prominent_Features_of_Rumor_Propagation_in_Online_Social_Media","262395532_Faking_Sandy_characterizing_and_identifying_fake_images_on_Twitter_during_Hurricane_Sandy","262333747_On_the_Resemblance_and_Containment_of_Documents","261264390_Rumor_detection_on_twitter","248591742_An_extensive_empirical_study_of_feature_selection_metrics_for_text_classification_J","241624056_Credibility_ranking_of_tweets_during_high_impact_events","234139130_Twitter_Under_Crisis_Can_we_trust_what_we_RT","224396178_Information_Seeking_Can_Be_Social","221366753_The_PASCAL_recognising_textual_entailment_challenge","221298097_Is_Twitter_a_Good_Place_for_Asking_Questions_A_Characterization_Study","221297912_Detecting_and_Tracking_Political_Abuse_in_Social_Media","221023878_Information_credibility_on_Twitter","220320056_Forman_G_An_Extensive_Empirical_Study_of_Feature_Selection_Metrics_for_Text_Classification_Journal_of_Machine_Learning_Research_3_1289-1305","215990477_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Supervised_Learning_Algorithms","47797509_Truthy","312538118_Support-vector_networks","310606656_Classification_and_regression_trees","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","272623654_Libsvm","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","263378078_Rumor_Research_Revisited_and_Expanded","262395578_Questions_about_questions_An_empirical_analysis_of_information_needs_on_Twitter","258716529_Identifying_Rumors_and_Their_Sources_in_Social_Networks","242637644_An_Algorithm_for_Suffix_Stripping","241770743_Automatic_detection_of_rumor_on_Sina_Weibo","235961479_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","232562126_Inside_rumor_A_personal_journey","232529798_Rumor_Psychology_Social_and_Organizational_Approaches","224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","221654391_Meme-Tracking_and_the_Dynamics_of_the_News_Cycle","221514776_What_Do_People_Ask_Their_Social_Networks_and_Why_A_Survey_Study_of_Status_Message_QA_Behavior","221297864_A_Comparison_of_Information_Seeking_Using_Search_Engines_and_Social_Networks","221297832_Culture_Matters_A_Survey_Study_of_Social_QA_Behavior","221213158_TwitterMonitor_Trend_Detection_over_the_Twitter_Stream","221013222_Rumor_has_it_Identifying_Misinformation_in_Microblogs","220878696_Tweeting_is_Believing_Understanding_Microblog_Credibility_Perceptions","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","220049032_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","51939275_LexRank_Graph-based_Lexical_Centrality_As_Salience_in_Text_Summarization"]}
