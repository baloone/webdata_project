{"id":"341229871_Big_data_security_access_control_algorithm_based_on_memory_index_acceleration_in_WSNs","abstract":"Abstract The access control is used to ensure these data security when WSN (wireless sensor network) with a large number of base stations transmits huge amount of data to a data center server. Meanwhile big data systems are used to efficiently store, manage, and use data from large-scale WSNs. In big data systems for WSNs, the traditional access control technology will greatly affect the system performance. This paper first analyzes the data processing flow of the traditional access control strategy in big data systems, analyzes its time complexity, and explores how it affects system performance. Then, we propose the big data security access control algorithm based on memory index acceleration in WSNs which has better performance over the traditional ones. In our experiments, under the same test environment and security strategy, the performance has been greatly improved with the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Jianhua Peng","Hui Zhou","Meng Qingjie","Jingli Yang"],"meta":["May 2020EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13638-020-01725-1"],"references":["335468200_CL-CPPA_Certificate-Less_Conditional_Privacy-Preserving_Authentication_Protocol_for_the_Internet_of_Vehicles","333119344_Permission-Based_Separation_of_Duty_in_Dynamic_Role-Based_Access_Control_Model","336269304_Intelligent_data_fusion_algorithm_based_on_hybrid_delay-aware_adaptive_clustering_in_wireless_sensor_networks","335861695_Secured_Fine-Grained_Selective_Access_to_Outsourced_Cloud_Data_in_IoT_Environments","335764946_Multimodal_Representation_Learning_for_Recommendation_in_Internet_of_Things","335533257_Fuzzy_logic_based_approach_for_ship-bridge_collision_alert_system","333472112_A_Data_Security_Storage_Method_for_IoT_Under_Hadoop_Cloud_Computing_Platform","333008026_Policy-based_access_control_for_constrained_healthcare_resources_in_the_context_of_the_Internet_of_Things","331367339_An_Efficient_Passenger-Hunting_Recommendation_Framework_with_Multi-Task_Deep_Learning","331209101_Object-Specific_Role-Based_Access_Control"]}
