{"id":"221608211_ChemInk_A_Natural_Real-Time_Recognition_System_for_Chemical_Drawings","abstract":"We describe a new sketch recognition framework for chemical structure drawings that combines multiple levels of visual features using a jointly trained conditional random field. This joint model of appearance at different levels of detail makes our framework less sensitive to noise and drawing variations, improving accuracy and robustness. In addition, we present a novel learning-based approach to corner detection that achieves nearly perfect accuracy in our domain. The result is a recognizer that is better able to handle the wide range of drawing styles found in messy freehand sketches. Our system handles both graphics and text, producing a complete molecular structure as output. It works in real time, providing visual feedback about the recognition progress. On a dataset of chemical drawings our system achieved an accuracy rate of 97.4%, an improvement over the best reported results in literature. A preliminary user study also showed that participants were on average over twice as fast using our sketch-based system compared to ChemDraw, a popular CAD-based tool for authoring chemical diagrams. This was the case even though most of the users had years of experience using ChemDraw and little or no experience using Tablet PCs.","authors":["Tom Yu Ouyang","Randall Davis"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1145/1943403.1943444","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, February 13-16, 2011, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"references":["228776073_Statistical_visual_language_models_for_ink_parsing","222232867_An_image-based_trainable_symbol_recognizer_for_hand-drawn_sketches","221607733_PaleoSketch_Accurate_primitive_sketch_recognition_and_beautification","220815896_LADDER_A_Language_to_Describe_Drawing_Display_and_Editing_in_Sketch_Recognition","4108018_Recognition_and_grouping_of_handwritten_text_in_diagrams_and_equations","2496082_Sketch_Based_Interfaces_Early_Processing_for_Sketch_Understanding","289751479_MathPad2_A_system_for_the_creation_and_exploration_of_mathematical_sketches","285906939_Numerical_optimization","279823994_Envisioning_sketch_recognition_a_local_feature_based_approach_to_recognizing_informal_sketches","242296042_title_Interpretation_of_Molecule_Conformations_from_Drawn_Diagrams","234814420_MathPad_2_A_system_for_the_creation_and_exploration_of_mathematical_sketches","230873264_Numerical_Optimization_Second_Edition","229078422_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_for_Approximate_Inference_-_an_Empirical_Study","222817667_Learning_Generative_Visual_Models_from_Few_Training_Examples_An_Incremental_Bayesian_Approach_Tested_on_101_Object_Categories","222667964_Combining_geometry_and_domain_knowledge_to_interpret_hand-drawn_diagrams","222363290_Sketch_recognition_in_interspersed_drawings_using_time-based_graphical_models","221617782_Learning_from_Neighboring_Strokes_Combining_Appearance_and_Context_for_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition","221604563_Recognition_of_Hand_Drawn_Chemical_Diagrams","220877273_SketchREAD_a_multi-domain_sketch_recognition_engine","220860994_Learning_Diagram_Parts_with_Hidden_Random_Fields","220812043_A_Visual_Approach_to_Sketched_Symbol_Recognition","220772408_Revisiting_ShortStraw_Improving_Corner_Finding_in_Sketch-Based_Interfaces","38000868_Envisioning_sketch_recognition_a_local_feature_based_approach_to_recognizing_informal_sketches","30870417_The_Electronic_Cocktail_Napkin_-_A_computational_environment_for_working_with_design_diagrams","3816624_Object_Recognition_from_Local_Scale-Invariant_Features","2886117_Shallow_Parsing_with_Conditional_Random_Fields","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data"]}
