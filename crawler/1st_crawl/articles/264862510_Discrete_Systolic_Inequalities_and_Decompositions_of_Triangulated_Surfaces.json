{"id":"264862510_Discrete_Systolic_Inequalities_and_Decompositions_of_Triangulated_Surfaces","abstract":"How much cutting is needed to simplify the topology of a surface? We provide bounds for several instances of this question, for the minimum length of topologically non-trivial closed curves, pants decompositions, and cut graphs with a given combinatorial map in triangulated combinatorial surfaces (or their dual cross-metric counterpart).\nOur work builds upon Riemannian systolic inequalities, which bound the minimum length of non-trivial closed curves in terms of the genus and the area of the surface. We first describe a systematic way to translate Riemannian systolic inequalities to a discrete setting, and vice-versa. This implies a conjecture by Przytycka and Przytycki from 1993, a number of new systolic inequalities in the discrete setting, and the fact that a theorem of Hutchinson on the edge-width of triangulated surfaces and Gromov's systolic inequality for surfaces are essentially equivalent.\nThen we focus on topological decompositions of surfaces. Relying on ideas of Buser, we prove the existence of pants decompositions of length O(g3/2n1/2) for any triangulated combinatorial surface of genus g with n triangles, and describe an O(gn)-time algorithm to compute such a decomposition.\nFinally, we consider the problem of embedding a cut graph with a given combinatorial map on a given surface. Using random triangulations, we prove (essentially) that, for any choice of combinatorial map of cut graph, there are some surfaces on which any embedding has length superlinear in the number of triangles of the triangulated combinatorial surface.","authors":["Éric Colin de Verdière","Alfredo Hubard","Arnaud de Mesmay"],"meta":["August 2014Discrete & Computational Geometry 53(3)","DOI:10.1145/2582112.2582127","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265824981_Global_Conformal_Surface_Parameterization","258223890_Delaunay_Triangulation_of_Manifolds","248147229_Sign_and_geometric_meaning_of_curvature","236635245_Explicit_bounds_for_graph_minors","235712572_Untangling_Two_Systems_of_Noncrossing_Curves","227261075_Recent_Advances_in_Compression_of_3D_Meshes","225913168_Recent_Advances_in_Remeshing_of_Surfaces","224367204_Surface_Mapping_Using_Consistent_Pants_Decomposition","221661384_Multiple-Source_Shortest_Paths_in_Embedded_Graphs","221590702_Homology_Flows_Cohomology_Cuts","221569487_Surface_triangulations_without_short_noncontractible_cycles","220983507_Minimum_cuts_and_shortest_homologous_cycles","220780131_Global_Minimum_Cuts_in_Surface_Embedded_Graphs","220779441_Greedy_optimal_homotopy_and_homology_generators","220779323_Computing_Replacement_Paths_in_Surface_Embedded_Graphs","220617943_Tightening_Nonsimple_Paths_and_Cycles_on_Surfaces","220452250_Computing_the_Shortest_Essential_Cycle","344604401_Riemannian_Geometry","268646428_Riemannian_Geometry","267166887_Systolic_geometry_and_topology_With_an_appendix_by_Jake_P_Solomon","266962862_Riemannian_geometry_Geometria_riemanniana","266013961_Isometric_embedding_of_Riemannian_manifolds_in_Euclidean_spaces","265347380_Some_inequalities_in_certain_nonorientable_Riemannian_manifolds","265003938_Combinatorial_Optimization_of_Cycles_and_Bases","254206489_Filling_Riemannian_Manifolds","248390470_Algebraic_Topology","247695831_Systoles_and_intersystolic_inequalities","247584040_Some_Enumeration_Problems_in_Graph_Theory","244954097_A_comprehensive_introduction_to_differential_geometry_Vol_V_2nd_ed","238680661_Classical_Topology_Combinatorial_Group_Theory","234808245_Optimal_Pants_Decompositions_and_Shortest_Homotopic_Cycles_on_an_Orientable_Surface","230675280_Riemannian_Geometry","228529723_Algorithms_for_the_Edge-Width_of_an_Embedded_Graph","228338862_Asymptotic_bounds_for_separating_systoles_on_surfaces","226978956_On_the_period_matrix_of_a_Riemann_surface_of_large_genus_with_an_Appendix_by_JH_Conway_and_NJA_Sloane","225418727_Finding_Shortest_Non-separating_and_Non-contractible_Cycles_for_Topologically_Embedded_Graphs","225378300_A_manifold_which_does_not_admit_any_differentiable_structure","225342979_Automorphisms_of_random_graphs_with_specified_degrees","223143937_Graph_Minors_VII_Disjoint_paths_on_a_surface","222516091_Splitting_Complicated_Surfaces_is_Hard","220983379_Computing_shortest_non-trivial_cycles_on_orientable_surfaces_of_bounded_genus_in_almost_linear_time","220780271_Genus_and_the_Geometry_of_the_Cut_Graph","220770095_Finding_Shortest_Non-Separating_and_Non-Contractible_Cycles_for_Topologically_Embedded_Graphs","220720659_Seamless_texture_mapping_of_subdivision_surfaces_by_model_pelting_and_texture_blending","220556607_Hierarchy_of_surface_models_and_irreducible_triangulations","220533200_On_Short_Noncontractible_Cycles_in_Embedded_Graphs","220532733_On_a_Lower_Bound_for_Short_Noncontractible_Cycles_in_Embedded_Graphs","220505799_Surface_sampling_and_the_intrinsic_Voronoi_diagram","220489297_Computing_Shortest_Non-Trivial_Cycles_on_Orientable_Surfaces_of_Bounded_Genus_in_Almost_Linear_Time","220345328_Topological_characteristics_of_random_triangulated_surfaces","220183440_Removing_Excess_Topology_from_Isosurfaces","220186779_A_simple_construction_of_high_representativity_triangulations","49459374_On_the_period_matrix_of_a_Riemann_surface_of_large_genus","49459345_Geometry_and_Spectra_of_Compact_Riemann_Surfaces","47758321_Short_Loop_Decompositions_of_Surfaces_and_the_Geometry_of_Jacobians"]}
