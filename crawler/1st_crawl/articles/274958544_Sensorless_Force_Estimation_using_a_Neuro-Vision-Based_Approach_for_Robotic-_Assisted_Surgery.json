{"id":"274958544_Sensorless_Force_Estimation_using_a_Neuro-Vision-Based_Approach_for_Robotic-_Assisted_Surgery","abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of lack of force feedback in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries. Force is an important measure for surgeons in order to prevent intra-operative complications and tissue damage. Thus, an innovative neuro-vision based force estimation approach is proposed. Tissue surface displacement is first measured via minimization of an energy functional. A neuro approach is then use to establish a geometric-visual relation and estimate the applied force. The proposed approach eliminates the need of add-on sensors, carrying out biocompatibility studies and is applicable to tissues of any shape. Moreover, we provided an improvement from 56.16% to 15.14% over other approaches which demonstrate the potential of our proposal.","authors":["Angelica I. Aviles","Samar M.
