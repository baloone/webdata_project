{"id":"326848775_The_Gender_Question_in_Education_Theory_Pedagogy_and_Politics","abstract":"In this innovative book, four prominent philosophers of education introduce readers to the central debates about the role of gender in educational practice, policymaking, and theory. More a record of a continuing conversation than a statement of a fixed point of view, The Gender Question in Education enables students and practicing teachers to think through to their own conclusions and to add their own voices to the conversation. Throughout, the authors emphasize the value of a gender-sensitive perspective on educational issues and the relevance of an ethics of care for educational practice. Among the topics discussed are feminist pedagogy, gender freedom in public education, androgyny, sex education, multiculturalism, the inclusive curriculum, and the educational significance of an ethics of care. The multiauthor, dialogic structure of this book provides unusual breadth and cohesiveness as well as a forum for the exchange of ideas, making it both an ideal introduction to gender analysis in education and a model for more advanced students of gender issues.","authors":["Ann Diller","Barbara Houston","Kathryn Pauly Morgan","Mary Ayim"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.4324/9780429496530","ISBN: 9780429496530"],"references":["353220822_Women_in_Educational_Administration","292607527_Empathy_Polyandry_and_the_Myth_of_the_Coy_Female","350931372_Reflections_on_The_Right_use_of_School_Studies_with_a_View_to_the_Love_of_God","345563327_A_Conceptual_Analysis_of_Sexism_and_Sexist_Education","345562825_Women's_Physical_Education_A_Gender-Sensitive_Perspective","345033524_Learning_Liberation_Women's_Response_to_Men's_Education","339452784_Sex_and_Gender_The_Development_of_Masculinity_and_Femininity","334495473_The_Contradiction_and_the_Challenge_of_the_Educated_Woman","324308417_Philosophy_and_Feminist_Thinking","324300074_The_Psychology_of_Occupations","323321688_Bodies_that_matter_on_the_discursive_limits_of_sex","323321605_White_Women_Race_Matters_The_Social_Construction_of_Whiteness","323321262_The_politics_of_reality_essays_in_feminist_theory","323321237_White_Privilege_and_Male_Privilege_A_Personal_Account_of_Coming_to_See_Correspondences_Through_Work_in_Women's_Studies","323042450_FOR_HER_OWN_GOOD_150_YEARS_OF_THE_EXPERTS'_ADVICE_TO_WOMEN","321584929_Becoming_Educated_A_Journey_of_Alienation_or_Integration","318850051_The_chilly_climate_for_faculty_women_at_western_Postscript_to_the_backhouse_report","318519210_Reclaiming_a_Conversation_The_Ideal_of_the_Educated_Woman","318517895_The_Dialectic_of_Freedom","314800563_Women_and_Social_Policy","313040166_Compulsory_Heterosexuality_and_Lesbian_Existence","306257442_Feminist_pedagogy_and_emancipatory_possibilities","306257406_Feminist_practice_and_poststructuralist_theory","305191994_Rescuing_Womanly_Virtues_Some_Dangers_of_Moral_Reclamation","300847245_9_Sex_roles_interruptions_and_silences_in_conversation","300244664_Self_and_Self-Determination","292771887_Feminist_values_Guidelines_for_a_teaching_methodology_in_women's_studies","289933260_Morality_Self_and_Others","289817741_The_History_of_Physical_Education","288967762_Equality_between_the_Sexes_An_Immodest_Proposal","288958073_Women's_rationality_and_men's_virtues_A_critique_of_gender_dualism_in_Gilligan's_theory_of_moral_development","288953828_Molehill_or_Mountain_What_We_Know_and_Don't_Know_About_Sex_Bias_in_Language","288345593_Teaching_and_learning_as_the_organization_of_knowledge","287661669_Philosophical_feminism_A_bibliographic_guide_to_critiques_of_science","284538717_Indoctrination_and_Education","284290749_'Pricks'_and_'chicks'_A_plea_for_'persons'","284175568_Dominance_and_Violence_in_Scientific_Discourse","283591395_Third_World_Women_and_the_Politics_of_Feminism","282004094_Is_Male_Gender_Identity_the_Cause_of_Male_Domination","281562288_Discipline_and_Punish_The_Birth_of_Prison","279742315_Excluding_Women_from_the_Educational_Realm","279742220_Why_Doesn't_This_Feel_Empowering_Working_Through_the_Repressive_Myths_of_Critical_Pedagogy","279742064_Fidelity_in_Teaching_Teacher_Education_and_Research_for_Teaching","279741690_Talking_About_Race_Learning_About_Racism_The_Application_of_Racial_Identity_Development_Theory_in_the_Classroom","279722588_Sex_Differences_in_Educational_Attainment_The_Process","279497288_Polarity_Versus_Plurality_Confessions_of_an_Ambivalent_Woman_of_Colour","278225953_Social_identity_Sociological_and_social_psychological_perspectives","277830030_Sexism_and_Racism_in_the_University_Analyzing_a_Personal_Experience","275984266_Maternal_Thinking_Toward_A_Politics_of_Peace","275692767_Theorizing_Black_Feminisms_The_Visionary_Pragmatism_of_Black_Women","274932096_What_Should_We_Do_with_a_Hidden_Curriculum_When_We_Find_One","274758701_And_Jill_Came_Tumbling_After_Sexism_in_American_Education","274553420_The_Closing_of_the_American_Mind_How_Higher_Education_Has_Failed_Democracy_and_Impoverished_the_Souls_of_Today's_Students","274474819_Feminist_Literary_History","274347213_In_a_Different_Voice_Psychological_Theory_and_Women's_Development"]}
