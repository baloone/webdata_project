{"id":"311902221_INSTRUMENTAL_COMPETENCE_IN_TRANSLATION_AND_INTERPRETING_CURRICULA_IN_SPAIN_PRE-EHEA_VS_EHEA_BACHELOR'S_DEGREES","abstract":"The implementation of the European Higher Education Area has made it necessary for universities to adapt to market requirements. The introduction of new technologies in the translation process and changes in the kinds of texts to be translated require universities to increase the number of subjects in which instrumental competence is essential. These subjects are computer science, documentation, terminology and audiovisual translation.\nIn order to draw conclusions on the changes introduced by the Bologna Process, we will present two comparative tables that allow the reader to check the changes made in recent years to Translation and Interpreting studies at Spanish universities with regard to instrumental competence. We will summarise some of these conclusions and present our own proposal on the distribution of this content in translation curricula.","authors":["Cristina Plaza-Lara"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":[]}
