{"id":"278155081_Degrees_of_continuous_mappings_open_mappings_and_closed_mappings_in_L-fuzzifying_topological_spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce L-continuity degree, L-openness degree, L-closedness degree of mappings between L-fuzzifying topological spaces. Moreover, we show that most of elementary results related to continuous mappings, open mappings, and closed mappings in general topology can be extended to L-fuzzifying topological spaces by means of the graded concepts.","authors":["Bin Pang"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 27(2):805-816","DOI:10.3233/IFS-131038"],"references":["284421346_Foundations_of_the_theory_of_LM-fuzzy_topological_spaces"]}
