{"id":"220683438_The_Structure_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_Minimality_and_Basic_Principles","abstract":"Basic structural properties of tail-biting trellises are investigated. We start with rigorous definitions of various types of minimality for such trellises. We then show that biproper tail-biting trellises are not necessarily minimal, even though every minimal tail-biting trellis is biproper. We introduce the notion of linear trellises and prove, by example, that a minimal tail-biting trellis need not have any linearity properties whatsoever. We prove that a trellis is linear if and only if it factors into a product of elementary trellises. Using this result, we show how to construct, for any given linear code C, a tail-biting trellis that minimizes the product of state-space sizes among all possible linear tail-biting trellises. We also prove that every minimal linear tail-biting trellis for C arises from a certain n × n characteristic matrix, and show how to compute this matrix in time O(n2) from any basis for C.","authors":["Ralf Kötter","Alexander Vardy"],"meta":["January 2003IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 49:2081-2105","DOI:10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023529","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228057795_A_New_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Linear_Programming-II","46957856_Sphere_Packings_Lattices_and_Groups","3862255_Minimal_tail-biting_trellises_for_linear_MDS_codes_over_Fp_m","3764753_Iterative_min-sum_decoding_of_tail-biting_codes","3157745_Bit-Level_Soft-Decision_Decoding_of_Reed-Solomon_Codes","2408031_Codes_and_Decoding_on_General_Graphs","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","253894705_Iterative_Decoding_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_and_Connections_with_Symbolic_Dynamics","243777741_Trellis_structure_of_codes","242562732_A_Strongly_Polynomial_Algorithm_to_Solve_Combinatorial_Linear_Programs","229646968_Tailbiting_Convolutional_Codes","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming","227705372_Codes_and_Iterative_Decoding_on_General_Graphs","224733795_On_Tail_Biting_Conventional_Codes","224067045_Decoding_of_codes_based_on_their_tailbiting_trellises","220679793_The_Golay_convolutional_code_-_Some_application_aspects","3862264_General_structure_and_construction_of_tail_biting_trellises_for_linear_block_codes","3768124_Bit_Level_Soft_Decision_decoding_reed-solomon_codes","3764818_Construction_of_minimal_tail-biting_trellises","3084814_The_Structure_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_Minimality_and_Basic_Principles","3080576_Tailbiting_codes_Bounds_and_search_results","3080334_Factor_Graphs_and_the_Sum-Product_Algorithm","3080138_Linear_tail-biting_trellises_the_square-root_bound_and_applications_for_Reed-Muller_codes","3080135_Note_on_type_II_convolutional_codes","3079935_Optimal_and_near-optimal_for_short_and_moderate-length_tailbiting_trellises","3079860_Minimal_tail-biting_trellises_The_Golay_code_and_more","3079289_Upper_bounds_on_trellis_complexity_of_lattices","3079123_The_trellis_structure_of_maximal_fixed-cost_codes","3079118_Proof_of_a_conjecture_of_McEliece_regarding_the_expansion_index_of_the_minimal_trellis","3078999_On_the_BCJR_trellis_for_linear_block_codes","3078877_On_the_Trellis_Structure_of_Block_Codes","3078865_Lower_Bounds_on_Trellis_Complexity_of_Block_Codes","3078604_Densitylength_profiles_and_trellis_complexity_of_lattices","3077273_Minimal_trellises_for_block_codes","2526739_On_the_Theory_of_Linear_Trellises","2522023_On_the_Representation_of_Codes_in_Forney_Graphs"]}
