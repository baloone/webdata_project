A case study was applied to students who were studying at the Faculty of Computer Science and Technology of the University of Computer Science. The application of the CTS educational orientation in the undergraduate classes allowed to promote and develop values such as responsibility, solidarity and cooperation, as well as appropriate attitudes towards economic and social sustainability.","authors":["Odiel Estrada Molina","Jimmy zambrano Acosta","Dieter Reynaldo Fuentes Cancell"],"meta":["September 2019"],"references":["328413098_Educacion_superior_ciencia_tecnologia_y_agenda_2030","292944756_Exigencias_didacticas_en_diseno_didactico_de_tareas_para_el_desarrollo_de_las_habilidades_investigativas","262414966_Procedimiento_para_determinar_las_Tendencias_Estadisticas_del_Desarrollo_de_la_Competencia_Investigativa_del_Ingeniero_en_Ciencias_Informaticas","356574097_CONTENIDOS_DE_NATURALEZA_DE_LA_CIENCIA_Y_LA_TECNOLOGIA_EN_LOS_NUEVOS_CURRICULOS_BASICOS_DE_EDUCACION_SECUNDARIA","343171845_TECNOLOGIAS_PARA_VIAS_TERCIARIAS_PERSPECTIVAS_Y_EXPERIENCIAS_DESDE_LA_ACADEMIA","291575600_Science_Culture_and_Its_Indicators"]}
