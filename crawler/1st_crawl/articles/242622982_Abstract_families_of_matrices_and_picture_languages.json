{"id":"242622982_Abstract_families_of_matrices_and_picture_languages","abstract":"A linguistic model to generate matrices (arrays of terminals) is presented. The sixclosure axioms which define abstract families of languages (AFL) are extended to matrices to obtain abstract families of matrices (AFM). Corresponding automata to recognize matrices are defined and equivalence established. Immediate application is shown in picture processing by generating a wide class of interesting pictures. Illustrations include generation of kolam patterns, wall paper designs and geometric patterns replicated several times. Simple transformations of a picture such as reflection, translation, halftum, and turning upside down are very naturally obtained.","authors":["G.
