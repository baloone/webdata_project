{"id":"225767803_Discrete-time_approximation_of_Wonham_filters","abstract":"A continuous-time finite-state Markov chain observed in white noise is considered. The well-known result of Wonham filter\nprovides a formula for obtaining posterior probabilities. Although the filter is of finite dimension, numerical schemes are\nneeded in applications because of the nonlinearity and because the observations are frequently collected in discrete moments.\nIn this work, we develop approximation schemes of Wonham filters by constructing discrete-time recursive algorithms. We prove\nthe convergence of the algorithm by weak convergence method and martingale averaging techniques. Numerical experiments are\nalso furnished to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.","authors":["Yin Gang George","Qing Zhang","Yuanjin Liu"],"meta":["February 2004Journal of Control Theory and Applications 2(1):1-10","DOI:10.1007/s11768-004-0017-7"],"references":["313509375_Some_Applications_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_to_Optimal_Nonlinear_Filtering","261367106_Some_Applications_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_to_Optimal_Nonlinear_Filtering","346678324_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","324339362_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","274181503_Statistics_of_Random_Processes","268886676_Discrete-time_Markov_chains_Two-time-scale_methods_and_applications","266246835_Approximation_and_Weak_Convergence_Methods_for_Random_Processes_With_Applications_to_Stochastic_Systems_Theory","266219540_Continuous-Time_Markov_Chains_and_Applications_A_Singular_Perturbation_Approach","256504631_The_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","250955751_On_the_Differential_Equations_Satisfied_by_Conditional_Probability_Densities_of_Markov_Processes","247646212_Statistics_of_Random_Processes_Springer_Verlag","220259798_Weak_Convergence_of_Hybrid_Filtering_Problems_Involving_Nearly_Completely_Decomposable_Hidden_Markov_Chains","220223057_Singularly_Perturbed_Discrete-Time_Markov_Chains","44503501_Markov_Chains_With_Stationary_Transition_Probabilities","38349608_Discrete-time_singularly_perturbed_Markov_chains_Aggregation_occupation_measures_and_switching_diffusion_limit","4058133_On_the_numerical_stability_of_time-discretised_state_estimation_via_Clark_transformations"]}
