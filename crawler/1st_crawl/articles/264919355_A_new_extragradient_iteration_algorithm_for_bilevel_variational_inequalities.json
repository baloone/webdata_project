{"id":"264919355_A_new_extragradient_iteration_algorithm_for_bilevel_variational_inequalities","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an approximation extragradient iteration method for solving bilevel variational inequalities involving two variational inequalities and we show that these problems can be solved by projection sequences and fixed point techniques. We obtain a strong convergence of three iteration sequences generated by this method in a real Hubert space.","authors":["Pham Ngoc Anh"],"meta":["January 2012Acta Mathematica Vietnamica 37(1)"],"references":["253982685_Generalized_Projection_Method_for_Non-Lipschitz_Multivalued_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","228617884_An_explicit_descent_method_for_bilevel_convex_optimization","227591586_An_extragradient_method_for_solving_bilevel_variational_inequalities","226314711_A_Projection-Type_Algorithm_for_Pseudomonotone_Nonlipschitzian_Multivalued_Variational_Inequalities","26487907_An_Extragradient_Method_for_Fixed_Point_Problems_and_Variational_Inequality_Problems","225843561_Using_the_Banach_Contraction_Principle_to_Implement_the_Proximal_Point_Method_for_Multivalued_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities"]}
