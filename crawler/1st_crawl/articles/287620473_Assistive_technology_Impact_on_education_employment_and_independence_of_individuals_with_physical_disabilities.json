{"id":"287620473_Assistive_technology_Impact_on_education_employment_and_independence_of_individuals_with_physical_disabilities","abstract":"The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss how assistive technology impacts individuals with disabilities in relation to their education, employment, and ability to live independently. Appropriately selected and utilized assistive technology is imperative for individuals to approach an even par with their non-disabled peers. This paper specifically addresses a number of key questions: How important is assistive technology (AT) to the success of individuals with disabilities in education, employment, and achieving independence? If AT is important, in what ways is it important? What essential need(s) are met by the use of AT in education, employment, and independence? What remain as unresolved issues and questions regarding the use of AT by individuals with disabilities as they pursue postsecondary education, meaningful careers, and living independently? This review notes that AT is a foundational support that produces multiple and life-altering benefits. While we know much about the impact of AT on the lives of individuals with disabilities, many unanswered issues and questions remain.","authors":["Norma Stumbo","Jay Martin","Brad Hedrick"],"meta":["January 2009Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation 30(2):99-110","DOI:10.3233/JVR-2009-0456"],"references":["228853249_Current_status_of_educational_support_provision_to_students_with","228662978_Convergence_of_assistive_devices_and_mainstream_products_Keys_to_university_participation_in_research_development_and_commercialization","226230738_Including_young_people_with_disabilities_Assessment_challenges_in_higher_education","21288944_Spinal_cord_injury_Rehabilitation_adds_life_to_years","7197754_Effect_of_a_Voucher_Benefit_on_the_Demand_for_Paid_Personal_Assistance","6937609_Employment_issues_and_assistive_technology_use_for_persons_with_spinal_cord_injury","294241247_Technology_and_transition_Tools_for_success","293734767_Patterns_of_engagement_in_leisure_activity_by_older_adults_using_assistive_devices","292232287_Maximizing_employee_effectiveness_through_use_of_Personal_Assistance_Services_at_the_workplace","290799724_Advantages_of_developing_survey_constructs_when_comparing_educational_supports_offered_to_students_with_disabilities_in_postsecondary_education","290570148_Assistive_technology_Choosing_the_right_tool_for_the_right_job","289337509_An_analysis_of_assistive_technology_supports_and_services_offered_in_postsecondary_educational_institutions","252186479_Workplace_personal_assistance_service_and_assistive_technology","249835647_Economic_Evaluation_for_Assistive_Technology_Policy_Decisions","248929894_Inclusive_Pedagogy_Teaching_Methodologies_to_Reach_Diverse_Learners_in_Science_Instruction","247870299_The_Intersection_of_Aging_Disability_and_Supportive_Environments_Issues_and_Policy_Implications","232438547_Supported_employment_and_assistive_technology_for_persons_with_spinal_cord_injury_Three_illustrations_of_successful_work_supports","227829637_Assistive_Technology_Policy_A_Road_to_Independence_for_Individuals_with_Disabilities","37630059_Factors_that_prevent_or_assist_the_integration_of_assistive_technology_into_the_workplace_for_people_with_spinal_cord_injuries_Perspectives_of_the_users_and_their_employers_and_co-workers","37151945_School_to_where_A_literature_review_on_economic_outcomes_of_youth_with_Disabilities","13940147_Relationship_between_use_of_technology_and_employment_rates_for_people_with_physical_disabilities_in_Australia_Implications_for_education_and_training_programmes","11886946_Vocational_outcomes_for_persons_with_severe_physical_disabilities_Design_and_implementation_of_workplace_supports","11181475_The_Psychosocial_Impact_of_Assistive_Devices_Scale_PIADS_Translation_and_preliminary_psychometric_evaluation_of_a_Canadian-French_version","10704382_A_Comparison_of_Assistive_Technology_and_Personal_Care_in_Alleviating_Disability_and_Unmet_Need","7877147_Assistive_technology_outcomes_in_work_settings","6988793_Sources_of_Payment_for_Assistive_Technology_Findings_From_a_National_Survey_of_Persons_With_Disabilities","6650257_Survey_of_state_vocational_rehabilitation_counselor_roles_and_competencies_in_assistive_technology"]}
