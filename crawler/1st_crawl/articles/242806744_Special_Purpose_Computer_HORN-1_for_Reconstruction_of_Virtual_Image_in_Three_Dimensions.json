{"id":"242806744_Special_Purpose_Computer_HORN-1_for_Reconstruction_of_Virtual_Image_in_Three_Dimensions","abstract":"We have designed and built a special-purpose computer for the reconstruction of virtual images in three dimensions, HORN-1 (HOlographic ReconstructioN). HORN-1 calculates light intensity at high speed. The speed of HORN-1 achieves 300 Mflops-equivalent, and its electric parts cost is 60 000 Japanese yen (500 US dollar). It takes about 24 minutes to reconstruct a 100 × 100 × 8 virtual image from a 400 × 400 hologram.","authors":["Tomoyoshi Ito","Takashi Yabe","Masashi Okazaki","Masanori Yanagi"],"meta":["September 1994Computer Physics Communications 82(2-3):104-110","DOI:10.1016/0010-4655(94)90159-7"],"references":["252151435_Computer-generated_holograms_A_simplified_ray-tracing_approach","234022170_Grape_Project_-_an_Overview","260624420_Computer-Generated_Binary_Holograms","243729890_Holography_Machine_HORN1_for_Computer-Aided_Retrieval_of_Virtual_Three-Dimensional_Image","234022135_A_Special-Purpose_Computer_for_Gravitational_Many-Body_Problems","234022127_Highly_Parallelized_Special-Purpose_Computer_Grape-3","226861355_Special_Purpose_Computers_in_Physics","224475171_Special_purpose_computer_system_for_Ising_models","222363962_Boundary-Fitted_Coordinate_Systems_for_Numerical_Solution_of_Partial_Differential_Equations_-_A_Review","222272485_QCDPAX_A_parallel_computer_for_lattice_QCD_simulation","44649359_Computer_generated_holograms_An_historical_review","41310418_A_Method_for_the_High-speed_Generation_of_Random_Numbers_with_Arbitrary_Distributions","23324079_A_New_Microscope_Principle"]}
