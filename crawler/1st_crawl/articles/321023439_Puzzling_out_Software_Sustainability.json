{"id":"321023439_Puzzling_out_Software_Sustainability","abstract":"Software Sustainability is gaining importance and, as occurs with any other new discipline, there are still many misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding it. In this paper we attempt to clarify the different aspects of software sustainability, from organizational sustainability to software sustainability, exploring the latter in great depth by considering its three dimensions. We also present an overview of the research that has been developed around software sustainability, which was obtained after reviewing the best known workshops and conferences on green and sustainable software and some journals. The results obtained principally address the environmental dimension, and specifically green software design, quality and requirements.","authors":["Coral Calero","Mario Piattini"],"meta":["November 2017Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems 16","DOI:10.1016/j.suscom.2017.10.011","Project: Green and Sustainable Software"],"references":["282325166_Framing_Sustainability_as_a_Property_of_Software_Quality","266658756_Systematic_mapping_Study_on_Software_Engineering_for_Sustainability_SE4S","262201412_Leveraging_energy_Efficiency_to_Software_Users_Summary_of_the_Second_GREENS_workshop_at_ICSE_2013","261768365_Safety_Security_Now_Sustainability_The_Nonfunctional_Requirement_for_the_21st_Century","252065247_Multidisciplinarity_interdisciplinarity_and_transdisciplinarity_in_health_research_services_education_and_policy","6477037_Multidisciplinarity_interdisciplinarity_and_transdisciplinarity_in_health_research_services_education_and_policy_1_Definitions_objectives_and_evidence_of_effectiveness","3732205_Application_of_statistical_process_control_SPC_software_in_totalquality_improvement_TQI"]}
