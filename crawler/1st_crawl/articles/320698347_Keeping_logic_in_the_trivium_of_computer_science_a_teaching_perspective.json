{"id":"320698347_Keeping_logic_in_the_trivium_of_computer_science_a_teaching_perspective","abstract":"In this paper we argue that the traditional syllabus of logic courses for computer science is outdated and missing its purposes, therefore contributing to the gradual relegation of logic from the computing curricula. We further provide some practical recommendations and directions that need to be considered in the adaptation of the logic course syllabi to the needs of modern computing practitioners.","authors":["Johann Makowsky","Anna Zamansky"],"meta":["November 2017Formal Methods in System Design 51(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10703-017-0301-z"],"references":["333019422_Fixing_Frege","325767102_Model-theoretic_logics","321518398_Elements_of_Finite_Model_Theory","316857373_Computer_programming_as_an_art","316793959_Mathematical_Logic_for_Computer_Science","316327144_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic","315736919_Grundzuge_der_Theoretischen_Logik","311255758_Boring_Formal_Methods_or_Sherlock_Holmes_Deduction_Methods","305775858_Theory_and_Applications_of_Computability","303931549_Helping_the_Tester_Get_It_Right_Towards_Supporting_Agile_Combinatorial_Test_Design","280104813_Teaching_Logic_to_Information_Systems_Students_Challenges_and_Opportunities","280104807_Teaching_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Are_We_Teaching_the_Wrong_Narrative","303823218_'Mathematical'_Does_Not_Mean_'Boring'_Integrating_Software_Assignments_to_Enhance_Learning_of_Logico-Mathematical_Concepts","297197127_Liberal_arts_education","280939945_Model_Theory"]}
