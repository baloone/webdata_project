{"id":"280804925_RSA_and_RC4_Cryptosystem_Performance_Evaluation_Using_Image_and_Text_File","abstract":"The process of transforming plaintext data into cipher text in order to conceal its meaning in case it fall to hand of unauthorized recipient is refers to as encryption. The systems that perform the encryption processes are known as cryptosystems, there are several cryptosystem algorithms: RSA, RC4, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, AES, IDEA, Skipjack, DSA, ElGamal, etc. The major features that identify and differentiate one cryptosystem algorithm from another are its ability to secure the protected data against attacks and its speed/efficiency. In this paper: application software was designed to implement RSA, and RCA encryption algorithms with advanced features of visual Basic 6 for the front end interface. Microsoft Access is used to design backend of the application, and the Macromedia Flash was also used to incorporate dynamic features that enhance the appearance of the application. The program was used to compare the performance of RSA and RC4. The encryption operation was carried out for both RSA and RC4 using five text files and five graphic files of different sizes 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kilobyte respectively. The major factor considered for measuring the performance of the algorithms (RSA and RC4) is the speed of execution using time of execution (TE) as parameter for the evaluation. The performance result was presented and analyzed. We discovered that the RC4 is better compare to RSA algorithm based on the experimental facts presented and the result analysis of the two evaluated algorithms.","authors":["Akinyele A Okedola","Yekini Nureni"],"meta":["April 2015"],"references":["288180684_Cryptography_System_for_Online_Communication_Using_Polyalphabetic_Substitution_Method","228775009_Performance_Analysis_of_Data_Encryption_Algorithms","26621365_Evaluation_of_the_RC4_Algorithm_for_Data_Encryption","4224931_A_Performance_Comparison_of_Data_Encryption_Algorithms","265433746_Wireless_Security_Handbook","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","2831611_Efficiency_Comparison_of_Several_RSA_Variants"]}
