{"id":"311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","abstract":"Clustering is a classic topic in optimization with $k$-means being one of the most fundamental such problems. In the absence of any restrictions on the input, the best known algorithm for $k$-means with a provable guarantee is a simple local search heuristic yielding an approximation guarantee of $9+\\epsilon$, a ratio that is known to be tight with respect to such methods. We overcome this barrier by presenting a new primal-dual approach that allows us to (1) exploit the geometric structure of $k$-means and (2) to satisfy the hard constraint that at most $k$ clusters are selected without deteriorating the approximation guarantee. Our main result is a $6.357$-approximation algorithm with respect to the standard LP relaxation. Our techniques are quite general and we also show improved guarantees for the general version of $k$-means where the underlying metric is not required to be Euclidean and for $k$-median in Euclidean metrics.","authors":["Sara Ahmadian","Ashkan Norouzi-Fard","Ola Svensson","Justin Ward"],"meta":["December 2016SIAM Journal on Computing 49(4)","DOI:10.1137/18M1171321"],"references":["312971435_Local_search_heuristics_for_k-median_and_facility_location_problems","285276845_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-level_Uncapacitated_Facility_Location_Problem_with_Penalties","314295725_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k_-Median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","312970804_Improved_combinatorial_algorithms_for_the_facility_location_and_k-median_problems","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","305092466_The_effectiveness_of_lloyd-type_methods_for_the_k-means_problem","301837348_Local_Search_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Means_in_Doubling_Metrics","301706373_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","281487160_Improved_and_Simplified_Inapproximability_for_k-means","279584158_How_slow_is_the_k-means_method"]}
