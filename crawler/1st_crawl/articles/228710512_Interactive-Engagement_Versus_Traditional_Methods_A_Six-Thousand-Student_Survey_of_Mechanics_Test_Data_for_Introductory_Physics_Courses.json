{"id":"228710512_Interactive-Engagement_Versus_Traditional_Methods_A_Six-Thousand-Student_Survey_of_Mechanics_Test_Data_for_Introductory_Physics_Courses","abstract":"A survey of pre/post-test data using the Halloun–Hestenes Mechanics Diagnostic test or more recent Force Concept Inventory is reported for 62 introductory physics courses enrolling a total number of students N6542. A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools, colleges, and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain g. The latter is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain (%post%pre) to the maximum possible average gain (100 %pre). Fourteen ''traditional'' (T) courses (N2084) which made little or no use of interactive-engagement IE methods achieved an average gain g T-ave 0.230.04 std dev. In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N4458) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain g IE-ave 0.480.14 std dev, almost two standard deviations of g IE-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes–Wells imply that IE strategies enhance problem-solving ability. The conceptual and problem-solving test results strongly suggest that the classroom use of IE methods can increase mechanics-course effectiveness well beyond that obtained in traditional practice. © 1998 American Association of Physics Teachers.","authors":["Richard Hake"],"meta":["January 1998American Journal of Physics 66(1)","DOI:10.1119/1.18809"],"references":["258944205_The_Initial_Knowledge_State_of_College_Physics_Students","255614782_Wherefore_a_science_of_teaching","294867180_Educational_challenges_for_the_university","274044766_Is_Physics_Education_Adapting_to_a_Changing_World","272544606_Improving_Faculty_Teaching_Effective_Use_of_Student_Evaluations_and_Consultants","259060708_More_than_misconceptions_Multiple_perspectives_on_student_knowledge_and_reasoning_and_an_appropriate_role_for_education_research","253493563_Constructing_objective_tests","253304636_Implications_of_cognitive_studies_for_teaching_physics","253095855_Guest_Comment_Revitalizing_undergraduate_physics-Who_needs_it","252870651_Learning_via_study_versus_learning_via_living"]}
