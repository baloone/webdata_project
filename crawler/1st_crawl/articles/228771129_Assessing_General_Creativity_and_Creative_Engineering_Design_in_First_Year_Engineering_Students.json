{"id":"228771129_Assessing_General_Creativity_and_Creative_Engineering_Design_in_First_Year_Engineering_Students","abstract":"Creativity is a vital tool for innovation in engineering. Psychology and engineering faculty developed the Creative Engineering Design Assessment (CEDA) because existing tools are limited. This measure was administered with general creativity measures in 63 engineering (57 males, six females) and 21 non-engineering (six males, 15 females) students in five week intervals. Inter-rater reliability showed high consistency overall and between the test and retest administrations. Only engineering males and females significantly differed on the retest. Engineering students with low, medium, and high creative engineering design did not statis-tically differ in their general creativity, not domain specific to engineering; however, only high scorers were significantly higher on the retest from the other groups. Future research is needed with larger samples.","authors":["Christine Charyton","John A Merrill"],"meta":["April 2009Journal of Engineering Education 145(2)","DOI:10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01013.x"],"references":["312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","311369035_Risk_tolerance_and_risk_aversion","269599337_A_framework_for_designing_and_improving_learning_environments_fostering_creativity","261797744_Creativity_across_domains_Faces_of_the_muse","260192174_Engineering_Creativity_A_Systems_Concept_of_Functional_Creativity","257431200_Learning_and_Teaching_Styles_in_Engineering_Education","247001017_On_creating_creative_engineers","245889937_Designing_and_Teaching_Courses_to_Satisfy_the_ABET_Engineering_Criteria","244449123_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Engineering_Student_Performance_and_Retention_V_Comparisons_with_Traditionally-Taught_Students","240966813_Measuring_Preference_for_Ideation_in_Creative_Problem-Solving_Training","235701088_Variances_in_the_impact_of_visual_stimuli_on_design_problem_solving_performance","232543095_Curriculum_Planning_for_Creative_Thinking_and_Problem_Solving","221629565_Supporting_reflective_practice_in_creativity_education","2628093_The_Future_Of_Engineering_Education_Ii_Teaching_Methods_That_Work","314115047_Creative_cognition_Theory_research_and_applications","298192161_The_well-rounded_IE_-_Breakthrough_thinking","298055439_Creativity_-_Cognitive_personal_developmental_and_social_aspects","296881308_Creativity_for_the_new_millennium","289110820_Assessing_creativity_in_engineers","270080525_The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine","260512262_The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","251977012_SMOG_Grading_--_a_New_Readability_Formula","247807751_General_Artistic_and_Scientific_Creativity_Attributes_of_Engineering_and_Music_Students","247807617_The_Effects_of_Affect_Manipulation_and_Information_Exposure_on_Divergent_Thinking","246069372_Engineering_and_the_Mind''s_Eye","245304285_Distributed_Multi-Reasoning_Mechanism_to_Support_Conceptual_Structural_Design","245041314_A_Review_of_creativity_principles_applied_to_engineering_design","243784303_The_Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking","237128260_Creativity_Genius_and_Other_Myths","234565871_Inventors_Versus_Problem_Solvers_An_Empirical_Investigation","234021792_Employee_Creativity_Personal_And_Contextual_Factors_At_Work","232587724_Toward_a_Model_for_the_Facilitation_of_Creative_Problem_Solving","232557823_Varieties_of_Divergent_Production","232510371_The_California_Psychological_Inventory_Manual","232487362_CEDA_A_Research_Instrument_for_Creative_Engineering_Design_Assessment","222672623_Metrics_for_measuring_ideation_effectiveness","220382160_FEATUREDesigning_worth---connecting_preferred_means_to_desired_ends","220040513_Implications_of_a_Systems_Perspective_for_the_Study_of_Creativity","210642213_A_Creative_Personality_Scale_for_the_Adjective_Check_List","201382158_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Professionals_Think_in_Action","200027379_Handbook_of_Creativity","35641599_Creativity_scientific_artistic_general_and_risk_tolerance_among_engineering_and_music_students","35222264_The_relationship_among_college_freshmen's_cognitive_risk_tolerance_academic_hardiness_and_emotional_intelligence_and_their_usefulness_in_predicting_academic_outcomes_PhD_dissertation","29813115_Redefining_Engineering_Education_The_Reflective_Practice_of_Product_Design_Engineering","12006636_Creativity_for_the_new_millennium","11946298_Creativity_Cognitive_Personal_Developmental_and_Social_Aspects","4879954_Investors'_risk_tolerance_and_return_aspirations_and_financial_advisors'_interpretations_A_conceptual_model_and_exploratory_data"]}
