{"id":"329216020_pyBIMstab_Application_software_for_2D_slope_stability_analysis_of_block-in-matrix_and_homogeneous_materials","abstract":"We present the application software, pyBIMstab, which evaluates the factor of safety (FS) against sliding of slopes made of either blocks-in-matrix (bimsoilbimrock) taking into account the tortuosity of failure surface or homogeneous materials with typical circularly-shaped surfaces. In the case of tortuous surfaces, they are found with the optimum pathfinding algorithm named A* (A star).","authors":["Exneyder A.
