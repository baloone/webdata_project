This article presents an authorial concept of using the environment of Cities: Skylines and the C# programming language to automate the process of importing official topographic data into the game engine and developing a prototype of a serious game that supports solving social and ecological problems. The model—developed using digital topographic data, digital terrain models, and CityGML 3D models—enabled the creation of a prototype of a serious game, later endorsed by the residents of the municipality, local authorities, as well as the Ministry of Investment and Economic Development.","authors":["Robert Olszewski","Mateusz Cegiełka","Ula Szczepankowska","Jacek Wesołowski"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Geo-Information 9(2):118","DOI:10.3390/ijgi9020118"],"references":["338359976_Automatic_Geodata_Processing_Methods_for_Real-World_City_Visualizations_in_Cities_Skylines","322325777_Solving_Smart_City_Transport_Problems_by_Designing_Carpooling_Gamification_Schemes_with_Multi-Agent_Systems_The_Case_of_the_So-Called_Mordor_of_Warsaw","281283917_Gamification_Ethics_Exploitation_and_Manipulation","337108899_The_Concept_and_Development_of_a_Serious_Game_Alter_Eco_as_Part_of_Creating_a_Digital_Twin_of_a_Smart_City","318883462_Learning_Analytics_Design","315828845_Serious_Games_for_Learning_A_model_and_a_reference_architecture_for_efficient_game_development","289659048_Benefits_of_Game_Analytics_Stakeholders_Contexts_and_Domains","285637737_Good_video_games_and_good_learning","281051811_Assessment_in_Game-Based_Learning","279928175_Expert_Systems_in_Cartographic_Design"]}
