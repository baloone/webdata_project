{"id":"329388932_Data_Analytics_for_Cooperative_Intelligent_Transport_Systems","abstract":"Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a key enabler of future road traffic management systems. The core component of C-ITS includes vehicles, road side units and traffic command centers. They generate a large amount of traffic that is made up of both mobility and service-related data. To extract useful and relevant information out of this data, data analytics will play a crucial role in future C-ITS applications. We present a review of how data analytics can benefit C-ITS applications. We describe the various types of data generated by C-ITS applications and potential dissemination techniques using various wireless technologies. We demonstrate how meaningful results from this data could be beneficial to C-ITS. We also demonstrate the improved reliability of C-ITS applications that can be achieved with data analytics using simulation results. Finally, we discuss future possible applications of data analytics in C-ITS.","authors":["Muhammad Awais Javed","Sherali Zeadally","Elyes Ben Hamida"],"meta":["November 2018Vehicular Communications 15","DOI:10.1016/j.vehcom.2018.10.004","Project: ITS Applications"],"references":["324552482_Sensor_Technologies_for_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems","324536927_A_Survey_of_Device-to-Device_Communications_Research_Issues_and_Challenges","322729284_Shapely_Value_Perspective_on_Adapting_Transmit_Power_for_Periodic_Vehicular_Communications","320933770_5G_for_Vehicular_Communications","318125008_The_MapReduce-based_approach_to_improve_vehicle_controls_on_big_traffic_events","309918072_An_architecture_for_big_data_processing_on_intelligent_transportation_systems_An_application_scenario_on_highway_traffic_flows","309516649_Fuzzy_Based_Scalable_Clustering_Algorithms_for_Handling_Big_Data_Using_Apache_Spark","323268538_Towards_a_Practical_Crowdsensing_System_for_Road_Surface_Conditions_Monitoring","321440916_LTE-V_for_Sidelink_5G_V2X_Vehicular_Communications_A_New_5G_Technology_for_Short-Range_Vehicle-to-Everything_Communications","315784245_FASPM_Fuzzy_Logic-based_Adaptive_Security_Protocol_for_Multi-hop_Data_Dissemination_in_Intelligent_Transport_Systems"]}
