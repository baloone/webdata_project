{"id":"272195454_A_Geometric_Approach_for_the_Upper_Bound_Theorem_for_Minkowski_Sums_of_Convex_Polytopes","abstract":"We derive tight expressions for the maximum number of $k$-faces,\n$0\\le{}k\\le{}d-1$, of the Minkowski sum, $P_1+\\cdots+P_r$, of $r$ convex\n$d$-polytopes $P_1,\\ldots,P_r$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\\ge{}2$ and $r<d$, as\na (recursively defined) function on the number of vertices of the polytopes.\nOur results coincide with those recently proved by Adiprasito and Sanyal [2].\nIn contrast to Adiprasito and Sanyal's approach, which uses tools from\nCombinatorial Commutative Algebra, our approach is purely geometric and uses\nbasic notions such as $f$- and $h$-vector calculus and shellings, and\ngeneralizes the methodology used in [15] and [14] for proving upper bounds on\nthe $f$-vector of the Minkowski sum of two and three convex polytopes,\nrespectively.\nThe key idea behind our approach is to express the Minkowski sum\n$P_1+\\cdots+P_r$ as a section of the Cayley polytope $\\mathcal{C}$ of the\nsummands; bounding the $k$-faces of $P_1+\\cdots+P_r$ reduces to bounding the\nsubset of the $(k+r-1)$-faces of $\\mathcal{C}$ that contain vertices from each\nof the $r$ polytopes.\nWe end our paper with a sketch of an explicit construction that establishes\nthe tightness of the upper bounds.","authors":["Menelaos I.
