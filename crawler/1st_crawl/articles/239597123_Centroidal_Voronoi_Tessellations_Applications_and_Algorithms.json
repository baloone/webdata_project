{"id":"239597123_Centroidal_Voronoi_Tessellations_Applications_and_Algorithms","abstract":"A centroidal Voronoi tessellation is a Voronoi tessellation whose generating points are the centroids (centers of mass) of the corresponding Voronoi regions. We give some applica- tions of such tessellations to problems in image compression, quadrature, finite difference methods, distribution of resources, cellular biology, statistics, and the territorial behavior of animals. We discuss methods for computing these tessellations, provide some analyses concerning both the tessellations and the methods for their determination, and, finally, present the results of some numerical experiments.","authors":["Vance Faber","Max Gunzburger"],"meta":["December 1999SIAM Review 41(4):637-676","DOI:10.1137/S0036144599352836"],"references":["318494291_Concrete_and_Abstract_Voronoi_Diagrams","318494192_Spatial_Tessellations_Concepts_and_Applications_of_Voronoi_Diagrams","313218004_Color_image_quantization_for_frame_buffer_display","313083866_Projection_pursuit_with_discussion","313007741_An_algorithm_for_vector_quantizer_design","312631627_Exploratory_projection_pursuit","307561907_Hexagonal_territories","284674786_EM_algorithm_for_clustering_and_two_stochastic_versions","279926802_OptiSim_An_extended_dissimilarity_selection_method_for_finding_diverse_representative_subsets","279367983_Vector_Quantization_and_Signal_Compression"]}
