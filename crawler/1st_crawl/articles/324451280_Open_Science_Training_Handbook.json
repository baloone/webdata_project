{"id":"324451280_Open_Science_Training_Handbook","abstract":"A group of fourteen authors came together in February 2018 at the TIB (German National Library of Science and Technology) in Hannover to create an open, living handbook on Open Science training. High-quality trainings are fundamental when aiming at a cultural change towards the implementation of Open Science principles. Teaching resources provide great support for Open Science instructors and trainers. The Open Science training handbook will be a key resource and a first step towards developing Open Access and Open Science curricula and andragogies. Supporting and connecting an emerging Open Science community that wishes to pass on their knowledge as multipliers, the handbook will enrich training activities and unlock the communityâ€™s full potential.\n\nIn this first release of the Open Science Training Handbook, some initial feedback from the community is already included.","authors":["Sonja Bezjak","April Clyburne-Sherin","Philipp Conzett","Pedro Lobo Fernandes"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1212496","Publisher: Zenodo","Projects: Open ScienceFOSTER Open Science"],"references":["345712083_The_prehistory_of_biology_preprints_a_forgotten_experiment_from_the_1960s","323152260_The_state_of_OA_A_large-scale_analysis_of_the_prevalence_and_impact_of_Open_Access_articles","323118701_Terminologies_for_Reproducible_Research","318316167_Journal_of_Open_Source_Software_JOSS_Design_and_first-year_review","317569317_Four_simple_recommendations_to_encourage_best_practices_in_research_software","316533599_What_is_open_peer_review_A_systematic_review","316236043_An_open_source_pharma_roadmap","322547880_Open_Science_now_A_systematic_literature_review_for_an_integrated_definition","318029681_Our_path_to_better_science_in_less_time_using_open_data_science_tools","317398663_A_Connected_Curriculum_for_Higher_Education","315803009_Upon_the_Shoulders_of_Giants_Open-Source_Hardware_and_Software_in_Analytical_Chemistry","312206140_A_manifesto_for_reproducible_science","310839507_Degrees_of_Freedom_in_Planning_Running_Analyzing_and_Reporting_Psychological_Studies_A_Checklist_to_Avoid_p-Hacking","307818221_Software_Carpentry_lessons_learned_version_2_referees_3_approved","307564171_Good_Enough_Practices_in_Scientific_Computing"]}
