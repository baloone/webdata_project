{"id":"325529520_sameAscc_The_Closure_of_500M_owlsameAs_Statements","abstract":"The owl:sameAs predicate is an essential ingredient of the Semantic Web architecture. It allows parties to independently mint names, while at the same time ensuring that these parties are able to understand each otherâ€™s data. An online resource that collects all owl:sameAs statements on the Linked Open Data Cloud has therefore both practical impact (it helps data users and providers to find different names for the same entity) as well as analytical value (it reveals important aspects of the connectivity of the LOD Cloud). This paper presents sameAs.cc: the largest dataset of identity statements that has been gathered from the LOD Cloud to date. We describe an efficient approach for calculating and storing the full equivalence closure over this dataset. The dataset is published online, as well as a web service from which the data and its equivalence closure can be queried.","authors":["Wouter Gerardus Beek","Joe Raad","Jan Wielemaker","Frank Van Harmelen"],"meta":["June 2018Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-93417-4_5","In book: The Semantic Web (pp.65-80)","Project: Identity Management in the Web of Data"],"references":["320202418_LOD-a-lot","267860271_Alignment-Based_Querying_of_Linked_Open_Data","259285353_Balloon_Fusion_SPARQL_Rewriting_Based_on_Unified_Co-Reference_Information","222837026_From_SHIQ_and_RDF_to_OWL_the_making_of_a_web_ontology_language","221466700_When_owlsameAs_Isn't_the_Same_An_Analysis_of_Identity_in_Linked_Data","221466058_SameAs_Networks_and_Beyond_Analyzing_Deployment_Status_and_Implications_of_owl_sameAs_in_Linked_Data","313362892_Managing_Co-reference_on_the_Semantic_Web","299448328_Optimising_Linked_Data_Queries_in_the_Presence_of_Co-reference","290767285_Adoption_of_the_Linked_Data_Best_Practices_in_Different_Topical_Domains","267555796_Statistical_Analysis_of_the_owlsameAs_Network_for_Aligning_Concepts_in_the_Linking_Open_Data_Cloud"]}
