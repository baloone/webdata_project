{"id":"262899868_The_Impact_of_Seating_Location_and_Seating_Type_on_Student_Performance","abstract":"While an extensive body of research exists regarding the delivery of course\nknowledge and material, much less attention has been paid to the performance effect of\nseating position within a classroom. Research findings are mixed as to whether students in\nthe front row of a classroom outperform students in the back row. Another issue that has\nnot been fully examined in higher education is the effect of environmental factors, specifically\nseating type, on student performance. This study examines the impact of both factors—seating\nlocation and seating type—on overall performance. Data were collected over a 10-year\nperiod from 1,138 undergraduate senior business students during their capstone course.\nThe findings suggest that student performance is not significantly altered by seating\nlocation or seating type.","authors":["Michael Meeks","Tamil L.
