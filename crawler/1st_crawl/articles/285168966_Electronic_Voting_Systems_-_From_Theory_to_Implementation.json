{"id":"285168966_Electronic_Voting_Systems_-_From_Theory_to_Implementation","abstract":"Electronic voting for local, regional and national elections and referenda is developing rapidly at a global scale as an efficient and low cost alternative to conventional methods of voting, with a positive impact on the quality of democratic representation.
