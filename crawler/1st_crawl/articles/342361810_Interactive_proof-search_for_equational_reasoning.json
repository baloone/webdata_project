{"id":"342361810_Interactive_proof-search_for_equational_reasoning","abstract":"Equational reasoning arises in many areas of mathematics and computer science. It is a cornerstone of algebraic reasoning and results essential in tasks of specification and verification in functional programming, where a program is mainly a set of equations. The usual manipulation of identities while conducting informal proofs obviates many intermediate steps that are necessary while developing them using a formal system, such as the equationally complete Birkhoff calculus B⁠. This deductive system does not fit in the common manner of doing mathematical proofs, and it is not compatible with the mechanisms of proof assistants. The aim of this work is to provide a deductive system B_GOAL for equality, equivalent to B but suitable for constructing equational proofs in a backward fashion. This feature makes it adequate for interactive proof-search in the approach of proof assistants. This will be achieved by turning B_GOAL into a transition system of formal tactics in the style of Edinburgh LCF, such transformation allows us to give a direct formal definition of backward proof in equational logic.","authors":["Lourdes del Carmen González Huesca","Pilar selene Linares Arevalo","Favio Ezequiel Miranda-Perea"],"meta":["May 2020Logic Journal of IGPL","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzaa013"],"references":["335083302_Axiomatic_and_Dual_Systems_for_Constructive_Necessity_a_Formally_Verified_Equivalence","280105061_How_to_prove_it_in_Natural_Deduction_A_Tactical_Approach","346676584_How_to_Prove_It_A_Structured_Approach","345403050_Algebraic_Semantics_of_Imperative_Programs","329548287_Theorem_proving_for_all_equational_reasoning_in_liquid_Haskell_functional_pearl","327735924_Theorem_proving_for_all_equational_reasoning_in_liquid_Haskell_functional_pearl","325490157_Programming_in_Haskell","319393637_Programming_in_Haskell","318865948_Introduction_to_Labelled_Deductive_Systems","300254218_Proof-Search_in_Natural_Deduction_Calculus_for_Classical_Propositional_Logic","266450563_An_introduction_to_mathematical_reasoning_Numbers_sets_and_functions","266367626_Algebraic_semantics_of_imperative_programs","259224120_Rewriting","251407400_Equational_Calculi_and_Automatic_Demonstration","245069221_A_Simpli_ed_Proof_Method_for_Elementary_Logic"]}
