{"id":"324041173_Generalized_roughness_in_fuzzy_filters_and_fuzzy_ideals_with_thresholds_in_ordered_semigroups","abstract":"In the present paper, concept of roughness for fuzzy filters with thresholds \\(\\left( u_{1},u_{2}\\right) \\) in ordered semigroups is introduced. Then, this concept is extended to fuzzy bi-filters with thresholds and fuzzy quasi-filters with thresholds. Further approximations of fuzzy ideals with thresholds, fuzzy bi-ideals with thresholds, and fuzzy interior ideals with thresholds are studied. Moreover, this concept is applied to study approximations of fuzzy quasi-ideals with thresholds and semiprime fuzzy quasi-ideals with thresholds.","authors":["Tahir Mahmood","Muhammad Irfan Ali","Azmat Hussain"],"meta":["March 2018Computational and Applied Mathematics 37(4)","DOI:10.1007/s40314-018-0615-5"],"references":["291600555_Fuzzy_quasi-ideals_with_thresholds_alpha_beta_in_ordered_semigroups","272630328_T-Rough_Ideal_and_T-Rough_Fuzzy_Ideal_in_a_Semigroup","268165746_T-rough_prime_primary_ideal_and_T-rough_fuzzy_prime_primary_ideal_on_commutative_rings","266179062_Semigroups_Characterized_by_the_Properties_of_Their_Fuzzy_Ideals_with_Thresholds","265462142_Rough_fuzzy_sets_and_fuzzy_rough_sets","287552812_Bi-filters_of_ordered_semigroups_related_to_fuzzy_points","267657721_Fuzzy_Interior_Ideals_with_Thresholds_s_t_in_Ordered_Semigroups","267085677_Fuzzy_semigroups","266256959_Roughness_of_ideals_in_BCK-algebras","265997585_Fuzzy_interior_ideals_in_ordered_semigroups"]}
