{"id":"327578136_A_Brain-Inspired_Decision-Making_Spiking_Neural_Network_and_Its_Application_in_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle","abstract":"Decision-making is a crucial cognitive function for various animal species surviving in nature, and it is also a fundamental ability for intelligent agents. To make a step forward in the understanding of the computational mechanism of human-like decision-making, this paper proposes a brain-inspired decision-making spiking neural network (BDM-SNN) and applies it to decision-making tasks on intelligent agents. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) A spiking neural network (SNN) is used to model human decision-making neural circuit from both connectome and functional perspectives. (2) The proposed model combines dopamine and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms to modulate the network learning process, which indicates more biological inspiration. (3) The model considers the effects of interactions among sub-areas in PFC on accelerating the learning process. (4) The proposed model can be easily applied to decision-making tasks in intelligent agents, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying through a window and a UAV avoiding an obstacle. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the model. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and existing biologically inspired methods, our method contains more biologically-inspired mechanistic principles, has greater accuracy and is faster.","authors":["Feifei Zhao","Yi Zeng","Bo Xu"],"meta":["September 2018Frontiers in Neurorobotics 12","DOI:10.3389/fnbot.2018.00056","Project: Brain-inspired Cognitive Engine (BrainCog)"],"references":["324117186_The_control_of_firing_pattern_in_nigral_dopamine_neurons_burst_firing","320017190_A_Brain-Inspired_Decision_Making_Model_Based_on_Top-Down_Biasing_of_Prefrontal_Cortex_to_Basal_Ganglia_and_Its_Application_in_Autonomous_UAV_Explorations","304034183_A_Mathematical_Model_of_Levodopa_Medication_Effect_on_Basal_Ganglia_in_Parkinson's_Disease_An_Application_to_the_Alternate_Finger_Tapping_Task","312256144_A_Basal_Ganglia_Network_Centric_Reinforcement_Learning_Model_and_Its_Application_in_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle","304579358_A_neurocomputational_model_of_Dopamine_dependent_Finger_Tapping_Task","297999861_DICHOTOMOUS_DOPAMINERGIC_CONTROL_OF_STRIATAL_SYNAPTIC_PLASTICITY","293104483_Functional_architecture_of_basal_ganglia_circuits_Neural_substrates_of_parallel_processing","288939863_Temporal-difference_learning","284757146_Synaptic_modification_in_cultured_hipocampl_neurons_dependence_on_spike_timing_synaptic_strength_and_postsynaptic_cell_type","281573255_Molecular_effects_of_dopamine_in_striatal-projection_pathways"]}
