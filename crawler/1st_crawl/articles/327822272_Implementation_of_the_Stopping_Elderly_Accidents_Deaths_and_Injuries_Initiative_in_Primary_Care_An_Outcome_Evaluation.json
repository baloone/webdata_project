{"id":"327822272_Implementation_of_the_Stopping_Elderly_Accidents_Deaths_and_Injuries_Initiative_in_Primary_Care_An_Outcome_Evaluation","abstract":"Background and objectives: \nOlder adult falls pose a growing burden on the U.S. health care system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) initiative was developed as a multifactorial approach to fall prevention that includes screening for fall risk, assessing for modifiable risk factors, and prescribing evidence-based interventions to reduce fall risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a STEADI initiative on medically treated falls within a large health care system in Upstate New York.\n\nResearch design and methods: \nThis cohort study classified older adults who were screened for fall risk into 3 groups: (a) At-risk and no Fall Plan of Care (FPOC), (b) At-risk with a FPOC, and (c) Not-at-risk. Poisson regression examined the group's effect on medically treated falls when controlling for other variables. The sample consisted of 12,346 adults age 65 or older who had a primary care visit at one of 14 outpatient clinics between September 11, 2012, and October 30, 2015. A medically treated fall was defined as a fall-related treat-and-release emergency department visit or hospitalization.\n\nResults: \nOlder adults at risk for fall with a FPOC were 0.6 times less likely to have a fall-related hospitalization than those without a FPOC (p = .041), and their postintervention odds were similar to those who were not at risk.\n\nDiscussion and implications: \nThis study demonstrated that implementation of STEADI fall risk screening and prevention strategies among older adults in the primary care setting can reduce fall-related hospitalizations and may lower associated health care expenditures.","authors":["Yvonne Johnston","Gwen Bergen","Michael Bauer","Erin M Parker"],"meta":["September 2018The Gerontologist 59(6)","DOI:10.1093/geront/gny101"],"references":["325092206_Deaths_from_Falls_Among_Persons_Aged_65_Years_-_United_States_2007-2016","323611449_Medical_Costs_of_Fatal_and_Nonfatal_Falls_in_Older_Adults_Medical_Costs_of_Falls","318354949_Implementing_a_Clinically_Based_Fall_Prevention_Program","308523139_Falls_and_Fall_Injuries_Among_Adults_Aged_65_Years_-_United_States_2014","298421607_Falls_and_Fall-Related_Injuries_among_Community-Dwelling_Adults_in_the_United_States","279200647_Prevalence_risk_factors_and_disability_associated_with_fall-related_injury_in_older_adults_in_low-_and_middle-incomecountries_Results_from_the_WHO_Study_on_global_AGEing_and_adult_health_SAGE","278110834_Summary_of_the_Updated_American_Geriatrics_SocietyBritish_Geriatrics_Society_Clinical_Practice_Guideline_for_Prevention_of_Falls_in_Older_Persons","224283587_Definitions_and_methods_of_measuring_and_reporting_on_injurious_falls_in_randomised_controlled_fall_prevention_trials_A_systematic_review","51409898_Effect_of_Dissemination_of_Evidence_in_Reducing_Injuries_from_Falls","51183314_Exercise_to_prevent_falls_in_older_adults_an_updated_meta-analysis_and_best_practice_recommendations","50394183_Epidemiology_of_Falls_in_Older_Age","12824646_Evaluating_the_Public_Health_Impact_of_Health_Promotion_Interventions_The_RE-AIM_Framework","8685925_The_Future_of_Health_Behavior_Change_Research_What_Is_Needed_to_Improve_Translation_of_Research_into_Health_Promotion_Practice","7821366_Beginning_with_the_application_in_mind_Designing_and_planning_health_behavior_change_interventions_to_enhance_dissemination","324583236_Interventions_to_Prevent_Falls_in_Older_Adults_Updated_Evidence_Report_and_Systematic_Review_for_the_US_Preventive_Services_Task_Force","323553262_How_older_adults_and_their_informal_carers_prevent_falls_An_integrative_review_of_the_literature","308025916_Interventions_for_preventing_falls_in_older_people_living_in_the_community","303634076_The_direct_costs_of_fatal_and_non-fatal_falls_among_older_adults_-_United_States","301734224_Lessons_Learned_from_Implementing_CDC's_STEADi_Falls_Prevention_Algorithm_in_Primary_Care","269773083_Implementation_and_Assessment_of_a_Fall_Screening_Program_in_Primary_Care_Practices","258134788_What_does_it_mean_to_employ_the_RE-AIM_model","236195594_Effectiveness_of_the_Chaos_Falls_Clinic_in_preventing_falls_and_injuries_of_home-dwelling_older_adults_A_randomised_controlled_trial","233537364_Development_of_STEADI_A_Fall_Prevention_Resource_for_Health_Care_Providers","230842931_Interventions_for_Preventing_Falls_in_Older_People_Living_in_the_Community","227167975_Gender_Differences_in_Seeking_Care_for_Falls_in_the_Aged_Medicare_Population","51205993_Primary_care_physicians_perceptions_and_practices_regarding_fall_prevention_in_adult's_65_years_and_over","40445939_The_long-term_effect_of_a_multifactorial_fall_prevention_programme_on_the_incidence_of_falls_requiring_medical_treatment","7931513_Gender_differences_for_nonfatal_unintentional_fall-related_injuries","7919699_Dissemination_of_an_Evidence-Based_Multicomponent_Fall_Risk-Assessment_and_-Management_Strategy_Throughout_a_Geographic_Area"]}
