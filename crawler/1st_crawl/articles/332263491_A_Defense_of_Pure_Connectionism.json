{"id":"332263491_A_Defense_of_Pure_Connectionism","abstract":"Connectionism is an approach to neural-networks-based cognitive modeling that encompasses the recent deep learning movement in artificial intelligence. Connectionist models center on statistical inference within neural networks with empirically learnable parameters, which can be represented as graphical models. More recent approaches focus on learning and inference within hierarchical generative models. Contra\ninfluential and ongoing critiques, I argue in this dissertation that the connectionist approach to cognitive science possesses in principle (and, as is becoming increasingly clear, in practice) the resources to model even the most rich and distinctly human cognitive capacities, such as abstract, conceptual thought and natural language comprehension and production. Consonant with much previous philosophical work on connectionism, I argue that a core principle—that proximal representations in a vector space have similar semantic values—is the key to a successful connectionist account of the systematicity and productivity of thought, language, and other core cognitive phenomena.","authors":["Alex Kiefer"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.18476.51842","Thesis for: Ph.D. in PhilosophyAdvisor: David Rosenthal","Project: Mental Representation as Higher-order Statistical Modeling"],"references":["323758234_Predictive_Coding_and_Thought","344660462_Semantic_Perception_How_the_Illusion_of_a_Common_Language_Arises_and_Persists","332089429_Word_and_Object","329975395_Grounded_Compositional_Semantics_for_Finding_and_Describing_Images_with_Sentences","324376900_Change_in_View_Principles_of_Reasoning","322777989_Child_first_language_and_adult_second_language_are_both_tied_to_general-purpose_learning_systems","320627198_Dynamic_Routing_Between_Capsules","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770249_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions","319663793_Inferential_Transitions","316943149_Content_and_misrepresentation_in_hierarchical_generative_models","313282483_Structural_representations_causally_relevant_and_different_from_detectors","311501707_Brain_Mechanisms_Underlying_the_Brief_Maintenance_of_Seen_and_Unseen_Sensory_Information","318958963_Lifelong_Learning_with_Dynamically_Expandable_Networks","310235569_Google's_Multilingual_Neural_Machine_Translation_System_Enabling_Zero-Shot_Translation"]}
