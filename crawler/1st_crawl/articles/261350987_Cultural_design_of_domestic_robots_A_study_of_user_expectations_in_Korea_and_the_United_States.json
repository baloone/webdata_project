{"id":"261350987_Cultural_design_of_domestic_robots_A_study_of_user_expectations_in_Korea_and_the_United_States","abstract":"In this paper, we describe the results of a comparative analysis of user-created designs for future domestic robots made by participants in Korea and the US. We identify their culturally variable expectations and preferences. We use a generative design methodology, which includes users visualizing their designs followed by semi-structured interviews. We describe our results in four areas of design: the look and feel of the robot, interaction mode, social role, and desired task. We identify variable cultural models relating to robotic technology and the cultural meaning of the domestic context as central factors. Finally, we discuss the design implications of our findings to culturally situated robot design.","authors":["Hee Rin Lee","JaYoung Sung","S.
