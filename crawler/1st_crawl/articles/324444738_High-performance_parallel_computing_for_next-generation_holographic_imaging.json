{"id":"324444738_High-performance_parallel_computing_for_next-generation_holographic_imaging","abstract":"Holography is a method of recording and reproducing three-dimensional (3D) images, and the widespread availability of computers has encouraged the development of holographic 3D screens (electroholography). However, the technology has not yet been used in practical applications because a hologram requires an enormous volume of data and modern computing power is inadequate to process this volume of data in real time. Here, we show that a special-purpose holography computing board, which uses eight large-scale field-programmable gate arrays, can be used to generate 108-pixel holograms that can be updated at a video frame rate. With our approach, we achieve a parallel operation of 4,480 hologram calculation circuits on a single board, and by clustering eight of these boards, we can increase the number of parallel calculations to 35,840. Using a 3D image composed of 7,877 points, we show that 108-pixel holograms can be updated at a video rate, thus allowing 3D movies to be projected. We also demonstrate that the system speed scales up in a linear manner as the number of parallel circuits is increased. The system operates at 0.25 GHz with an effective speed equivalent to 0.5 petaflops (1015 floating-point operations per second), matching that of a high-performance computer. A special-purpose holography computing board, which uses eight large-scale field-programmable gate arrays, can be used to generate 108-pixel holograms that can be updated at a video frame rate.","authors":["Takashige Sugie","Takanori Akamatsu","Takashi Nishitsuji","Ryuji Hirayama"],"meta":["April 2018Nature Electronics 1(4):254-259","DOI:10.1038/s41928-018-0057-5"],"references":["280242671_Improved_layer-based_method_for_rapid_hologram_generation_and_real-time_interactive_holographic_display_applications","313734268_Review_of_Fast_Calculation_Techniques_for_Computer-Generated_Holograms_With_the_Point-Light-Source-Based_Model","290978069_Review_of_Fast_Algorithms_and_Hardware_Implementations_on_Computer_Holography","286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","283235513_Special-purpose_computer_HORN-7_with_FPGA_technology_for_phase_modulation_type_electro-holography","267815782_Real-time_spatiotemporal_division_multiplexing_electroholography_with_a_single_graphics_processing_unit_utilizing_movie_features","263034896_Fast_calculation_with_point-based_method_to_make_CGHs_of_the_polygon_model","263027288_Rapid_hologram_generation_utilizing_layer-based_approach_and_graphic_rendering_for_realistic_three-dimensional_image_reconstruction_by_angular_tiling","260800285_Efficient_FPGA-Based_Fresnel_Transform_Architecture_for_Digital_Holography","259965539_Fast_computation_of_Fresnel_holograms_employing_difference","249324109_Submicron_Magneto-Optical_Spatial_Light_Modulation_Device_for_Holographic_Displays_Driven_by_Spin-Polarized_Electrons","258807879_Real-time_generation_of_high-definition_resolution_digital_holograms_by_using_multiple_graphic_processing_units","252061299_Real-Time_Error_Diffusion_for_Signal-to-Noise_Ratio_Improvement_in_a_Holographic_Projection_System","242806845_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN3_with_PLD_technology","242806744_Special_Purpose_Computer_HORN-1_for_Reconstruction_of_Virtual_Image_in_Three_Dimensions"]}
