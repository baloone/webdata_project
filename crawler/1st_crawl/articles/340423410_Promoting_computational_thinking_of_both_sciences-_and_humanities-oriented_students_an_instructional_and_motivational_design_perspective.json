We invited two groups of students (sciences- vs. humanities-oriented members) to participate in a six-stage learning session: to watch a folk-dance illustration (s1) and an animation (s2) of the bubble-sort algorithm; to reconstruct the algorithm on the same input (s3); to orchestrate the algorithm on a random input stored in a white(s4)/black(s5) array (visible/invisible sequence) and to watch a parallel simulation of several sorting algorithms as they work side-by-side on different color-scale bars (s6). To assess the current motivation of students we created nine specific questionnaires (Q1–9). The experiment we conducted included the following task sequence: Q1–2, s1, Q3, s2, Q4, s3, Q5, s4, Q6, s5, Q7, s6, Q8–9. We focused on assessing the motivational contributions of the generated (situational factors) emotions, challenge and active involvement during the e-learning experience. Research results revealed that there are no unbridgeable differences in the way these two groups relate to e-learning processes that aim to promote computational thinking. Although sciences-oriented students’ motivational-scores were consistently superior to their humanities-oriented colleagues, there was strong correlation between them; furthermore, differences diminished as both groups advanced with their learning tasks.","authors":["Zoltan Katai"],"meta":["April 2020Educational Technology Research and Development 68(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11423-020-09766-5"],"references":["320280511_Developing_Emotional_Design_Emotions_as_Cognitive_Processes_and_their_Role_in_the_Design_of_Interactive_Technologies","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","318457365_Use_of_digital_game_based_learning_and_gamification_in_secondary_school_science_The_effect_on_student_engagement_learning_and_gender_difference","312188115_Student_perceptions_of_active_learning","317158625_Remaining_trouble_spots_with_computational_thinking","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","314219839_Rising_to_the_Challenge_An_Emotion-Driven_Approach_Toward_Adaptive_Serious_Games","313596192_M_Motivational_design_of_instruction","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","304861449_e-Learning_and_the_Science_of_Instruction_Fourth_Edition"]}
