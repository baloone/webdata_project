{"id":"320858471_Ontology-based_smart_learning_environment_for_teaching_word_problems_in_mathematics","abstract":"This paper demonstrates how to use MONTO - machine readable ontology for teaching word problems in mathematics. MONTO is a combination of various ontologies. The paper gives background of the literature review and then states the gaps. It also describes MONTO and demonstrates its use, and bridges the gaps found in the literature of tutoring systems used for teaching problem solving. A description of the system implemented by using MONTO is included along with the key functionalities of the system derived from the ontology. A discussion of how these functionalities are useful for teaching word problems is included too. This paper also presents the results of a small-scale study conducted to evaluate the functionalities that are derived from the ontology.","authors":["Aparna Lalingkar","Chandrashekar Ramanathan","Srinivasan Ramani"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44188-6_35"],"references":["289963462_Learning_to_think_mathematically_Problem_solving_metacognition_and_sense_making_in_mathematics","344550450_Schemas_in_Problem_Solving","287260234_Learning_to_solve_problems_A_handbook_for_designing_problem-solving_learning_environments","274812028_'Problem-Solving'_Or_Problem_Solving","262187490_Mathematical_Problem_Solving","258948784_How_to_Solve_It_A_New_Aspect_of_Mathematical_Method","258510555_Teaching_and_Learning_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_Multiple_Research_Perspectives_Mahwah_NJ_Erlbaum","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","235700798_Human_problem_solving","233359516_An_Integrated_Model_of_Skill_in_Solving_Elementary_Word_Problems","222466354_Cognitive_Load_During_Problem_Solving_Effects_on_Learning","221579852_WORDMATH_A_computer-based_environment_for_learning_word_problem_solving","221185253_ACTIVEMATH_An_intelligent_tutoring_system_for_mathematics","220139948_LIM-G_Learner-initiating_instruction_model_based_on_cognitive_knowledge_for_geometry_word_problem_comprehension","2134794_Robust_Understanding_of_Word_Problems_with_Extraneous_Information"]}
