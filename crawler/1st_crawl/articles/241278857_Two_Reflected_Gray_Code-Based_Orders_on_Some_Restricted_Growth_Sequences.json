{"id":"241278857_Two_Reflected_Gray_Code-Based_Orders_on_Some_Restricted_Growth_Sequences","abstract":"We consider two order relations: that induced by the m-ary reflected Gray code and a suffix partitioned variation of it. We show that both of them when applied to some sets of\nrestricted growth sequences still yield Gray codes. These sets of sequences are: subexcedant and ascent sequences, restricted\ngrowth functions and staircase words. In particular, we give the first suffix partitioned Gray codes for restricted growth\nfunctions and ascent sequences; these latter sequences code various combinatorial classes as interval orders, upper triangular\nmatrices without zero rows and zero columns whose non-negative integer entries sum up to n, and certain pattern-avoiding permutations. For each Gray code, we give efficient exhaustive generating algorithms and compare\nthe obtained results.","authors":["Ahmad Sabri","Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["June 2013The Computer Journal 58(5)","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxu018","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265362712_Loop-free_sequencing_of_bounded_integer_compositions","229158097_Some_enumerative_results_related_to_ascent_sequences","225302670_On_021-Avoiding_Ascent_Sequences","222684735_Minimal_change_list_for_Lucas_Strings_and_some_graph_theoritic_consequences","222401233_The_coolest_way_to_generate_combinations","220909324_Generating_Gray_Codes_in_O1_Worst-Case_Time_per_Word","220074604_Binary_bubble_languages_and_cool-lex_order","45873435_Ascent_Sequences_and_Upper_Triangular_Matrices_Containing_Non-Negative_Integers","2136460_A_general_exhaustive_generation_algorithm_for_Gray_structures","244958006_A_Loopless_Generation_of_Bitstring_without_p_Consecutive_Ones","237005299_Combinatorial_Generation","236954725_Efficient_generation_of_restricted_growth_words","224483353_On_Generating_the_N-ary_Reflected_Gray_Codes","222705239_More_restrictive_Gray_codes_for_necklaces_and_Lyndon_words","222527649_22-free_posets_ascent_sequences_and_pattern_avoiding_permutations","220406820_A_Gray_Code_for_Compositions","220200455_Generating_involutions_derangements_and_relatives_by_ECO","220114760_Restricted_compositions_and_permutations_From_old_to_new_Gray_codes","220113048_Gray_codes_for_reflectable_languages","26645304_Gray_Code_Order_for_Lyndon_Words","2708262_Efficient_Generation_of_Subsets_with_a_Given_Sum","2507581_Gray_Codes_for_Set_Partitions_and_Restricted_Growth_Tails"]}
