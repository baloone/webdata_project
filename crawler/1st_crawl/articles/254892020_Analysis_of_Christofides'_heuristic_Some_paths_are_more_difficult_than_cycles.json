{"id":"254892020_Analysis_of_Christofides'_heuristic_Some_paths_are_more_difficult_than_cycles","abstract":"For the traveling salesman problem in which the distances satisfy the triangle inequality, Christofides' heuristic produces a tour whose length is guaranteed to be less than times the optimum tour length. We investigate the performance of appropriate modifications of this heuristic for the problem of finding a shortest Hamiltonian path. There are three variants of this problem, depending on the number of prespecified endpoints: zero, one, or two. It is not hard to see that, for the first two problems, the worst-case performance ratio of a Christofides-like heuristic is still . For the third case, we show that the ratio is and that this bound is tight.","authors":["Han Hoogeveen"],"meta":["July 1991Operations Research Letters 10(5)","DOI:10.1016/0167-6377(91)90016-I"],"references":["220432228_P-complete_approximation_problems_J_ACM_233_555-565","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","239064824_Performance_guarantees_for_heuristics","235067784_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_New_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","226425887_Tight_Bounds_for_Christofides'_Traveling_Salesman_Heuristic","201976939_The_traveling_salesman_problem_A_guided_tour_of_combinatorial_optimization_Reprint"]}
