{"id":"352780283_LITERATURE_REVIEW_ON_SOFTWARE_METRICS_AND_A_NEW_PROPOSAL","abstract":"The use of metrics is important in software \ndevelopment activities as they make it \npossible to check quality, identify failures \nand other benefits. The objective of this \npaper is to propose a new software metric \nbased on a bibliometric study and a \nliterature review on software metrics. The \nbibliometric research was carried out in the \nScopus and Web of Science databases to\nidentify the distribution of articles by year \nof publication, the main authors,\naffiliation, country, the most common \nlanguages, the types of documents,\njournals with more publications, areas of \nknowledge, and the keyword clusters. \nTwenty-three articles were subsequently \nselected for reading to compose the \nliterature review. The results of the \nbibliometric research show that (i) there is \nno defined core of research; (ii) there is a \nfluctuation of the number of published \narticles; (iii) the predominant language is \nEnglish, and the country with the highest \nindex of publications is the United States; \n(iv) the main area of knowledge is \ncomputer science; (v) in relation to \naffiliation, Florida Atlantic University \nstands out; (vi) the journal with the largest \nnumber of publications is the Journal of \nSystems and Software. The literature \nreview showed that many software metrics \ncan be used for different purposes, but \nmost of them are related to code, and none \nare related to acceptance. As such, a \nsupport metric for the software acceptance \nprocess is proposed to facilitate the \ndelivery phase of the software product, \nproviding security for the customer and \ncost savings for the developing company.","authors":["Marcos Dos Santos","Mara Barelos","Carlos Francisco Sim√µes Gomes","Adriana Manzolillo Sanseverino"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.25242/885X113120212284","Project: Logistic and supply chain"],"references":["340138873_Prediction_of_Web_Service_Anti-patterns_Using_Aggregate_Software_Metrics_and_Machine_Learning_Techniques","339434282_A_tale_of_two_databases_the_use_of_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus_in_academic_papers","339364197_Deriving_a_usage-independent_software_quality_metric","337709739_Software_Metrics_and_tree-based_machine_learning_algorithms_for_distinguishing_and_detecting_similar_structure_design_patterns","336233549_Threshold_Extraction_Framework_for_Software_Metrics","341196178_Predicting_future_influence_of_papers_researchers_and_venues_in_a_dynamic_academic_network","340098176_Usability_Requirements_Extraction_Method_from_Software_Document","339978493_Prediction_of_Quality_of_Service_Parameters_Using_Aggregate_Software_Metrics_and_Machine_Learning_Techniques","337589114_Comparison_of_systematically_derived_software_metrics_thresholds_for_object-oriented_programming_languages","331268045_Estimating_the_threshold_of_software_metrics_for_web_applications","324257305_Connecting_software_metrics_across_versions_to_predict_defects","323529251_A_framework_for_defining_coupling_metrics","322751126_Software_metric_evaluation_on_cloud_based_applications","328439831_A_Bibliometric_Assessment_of_Software_Engineering_Scholars_and_Institutions_2010-2017","326561539_Static_software_metrics_for_reliability_and_maintainability"]}
