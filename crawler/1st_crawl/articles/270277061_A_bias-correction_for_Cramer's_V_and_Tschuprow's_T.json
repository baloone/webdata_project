{"id":"270277061_A_bias-correction_for_Cramer's_V_and_Tschuprow's_T","abstract":"Cramér's V and Tschuprow's T are closely related nominal variable association mea-sures, which are usually estimated by their empirical values. Although these estimators are consistent, they can have large bias for finite samples, making interpretation difficult. We propose a new and simple bias correction and show via simulations that, for larger than 2 × 2 tables, the newly obtained estimators outperform the classical (empirical) ones. For 2 × 2 tables performance is comparable. The larger the table and the smaller the sample size, the greater the superiority of the new estimators.","authors":["Wicher Bergsma"],"meta":["September 2013Journal of the Korean Statistical Society 42(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.jkss.2012.10.002"],"references":["329537372_Generalized_latent_variable_modeling_Multilevel_longitudinal_and_structural_equation_models","321621253_Models_for_Discrete_Longitudinal_Data","314731686_Measures_of_Association_for_Cross_Classifications","311556947_Longitudinal_data_analysis_using_generalized_linear_models","285982622_Measures_of_Association_for_Cross_Classifications","275625404_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","269502822_Measures_of_Association","268914907_Grundbegriffe_und_Grundprobleme_der_Korrelationstheorie","268017475_Marginal_Models_for_Categorical_Data","267140345_Principles_of_the_mathematical_theory_of_correlation_Translated_by_M_Kontorowitsch"]}
