{"id":"353766361_The_Performance_Study_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems_using_Hybrid_Algorithm_Approach","abstract":"The goal of today's production strategy is to maximize the advantages of flexibility. Only when a manufacturing system is completely controlled by FMS technology is this possible. With the Process-Product Matrix in mind, it's feasible to see how an industry might achieve high flexibility via creative technological and organizational initiatives. A flexible cell is now defined as two or more CNC machines, while a flexible manufacturing system is defined as two or more cells. In computer science, system engineering, and many other areas, Petri nets are a strong modeling framework. Petri nets are a graphical description of the dynamic behavior of systems that combines a well-defined mathematical theory with a graphical representation of the dynamic behavior of systems. Because each of its aspects may be implemented in a number of ways and with varying degrees of complexity, the scatter search process is very adaptable. To handle scheduling challenges, the Petri Net idea is introduced and compared to the Scatter Search method. When the results of two case studies (9 machines X 2 jobs) are examined, it is shown that Petri Net outperforms Scatter Search in terms of machine usage.","authors":["Mahesh Gopal","Mohammed Kaso","Asegid Tadesse"],"meta":["June 2021"],"references":["312892346_Dynamic_Scheduling_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_System_Using_Scatter_Search_Algorithm","284297024_Scheduling_optimization_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_cuckoo_search-based_approach","264161297_A_scatter_search_algorithm_for_the_distributed_permutation_flowshop_scheduling_problem","257336310_Integrated_scheduling_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_evolutionary_algorithms","254423834_Scatter_Search_Algorithms_for_the_Single_Row_Facility_Layout_Problem","340357187_Petri-net-based_dynamic_scheduling_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_via_deep_reinforcement_learning_with_graph_convolutional_network","338539524_Scheduling_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_System_by_Hybridizing_Petri_Net_with_Improved_Scatter_Search_Algorithm","320380479_Modelling_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_a_review","307704316_Towards_improving_the_performance_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_a_case_study","305295353_Automation_Production_Systems_and_Computer_Integrated_Manufacturing","245331557_An_ISM_approach_for_modelling_the_enablers_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_The_case_for_India","243732441_Selecting_a_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_multiple_criteria_analysis","242625866_Classification_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems","243763522_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Petri_Net_Based_Supervisor_for_a_Flexible_Manufacturing_System","239395734_A_loading_and_dispatching_problem_in_a_random_flexible_manufacturing_system"]}
