{"id":"266584095_POPULARIZACAO_DA_CIENCIA_UMA_REVISAO_CONCEITUAL","abstract":"With this research developed in four different moments, we aim to establish a better understanding of the Science popularization concept. To do so, we will conduct a conceptual revision, which will allow us to recognize differences and similarities between the terms: Science vulgarization, scientific diffusion, scientific literacy and Science popu-larization, inadvertently used as synonyms for the same practice. We have attempted, based upon the theoretical fundaments in Popular Edu-cation, to face the problem of popular and people concepts, to fi-nally, starting from the idea of reflexive communication and dialog, suggest a concept of Science popularization linked to the universe of lib-erating cultural actions.","authors":["Marcelo Gomes Germano"],"meta":[],"references":["339593169_Ciencia_e_Publico_-_Caminhos_da_Divulgacao_Cientifica_no_Brasil","304552286_ALFABETIZACAO_CIENTIFICA_NO_CONTEXTO_DAS_SERIES_INICIAIS","30865040_Popularizacao_do_conhecimento_cientifico","44484329_Teoria_de_la_accion_comunicativa_complementos_y_estudios_previos_Jurgen_Habermas"]}
