{"id":"269116773_A_Simple_Homotopy_Proximal_Mapping_for_Compressive_Sensing","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel yet simple homotopy proximal mapping\nalgorithm for compressive sensing. The algorithm adopts a simple proximal\nmapping for $\\ell_1$ norm regularization at each iteration and gradually\nreduces the regularization parameter before the $\\ell_1$ norm. We prove a\nglobally linear convergence for the proposed homotopy proximal mapping for\nsolving compressive sensing under three different settings (i) sparse signal\nrecovery under noiseless measurements, (ii) sparse signal recovery under noise\nmeasurements, and (iii) nearly-sparse signal recovery under sub-gaussian noise\nmeasurements. In particular, we show that when the measurement matrix satisfy\nRestricted Isometric Properties (RIP), our theoretical results for settings (i)\nand (ii) almost recover the best condition on the RIP constants for compressive\nsensing. In addition, for setting (iii), our results for sparse signal recovery\nare better than the previous results, and furthermore our analysis for the\nfirst time proves that more observations lead to not only faster convergence\nbut also more accurate recovery. Compared with previous studies on linear\nconvergence for sparse signal recovery, our algorithm is simple and efficient,\nand our results are better and provide more insights.","authors":["Tianbao Yang","Lijun Zhang","Rong Jin","Shenghuo Zhu"],"meta":["June 2019Machine Learning 108(16)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-018-5772-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301840852_Extensions_of_Lipschitz_mappings_into_a_Hilbert_space","273351398_Solving_Basis_Pursuit","319770447_Convex_Analysis_Princeton_Mathematical_Series","309572808_A_Primal-Dual_Homotopy_Algorithm_for_ell_1-Minimization_with_ell_infty-Constraints","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","299680356_The_Banach_Fixed_Point_Theorem","292215307_Just_relax_Convex_programming_methods_for_identifying_sparse_signals_in_noise","280221190_Sharp_Time--Data_Tradeoffs_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","278433201_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","271922195_An_adaptive_accelerated_proximal_gradient_method_and_its_homotopy_continuation_for_sparse_optimization","271532495_Decomposable_Norm_Minimization_with_Proximal-Gradient_Homotopy_Algorithm","260711244_The_Computational_Complexity_of_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_the_Nullspace_Property_and_Related_Concepts_in_Compressed_Sensing","249903370_Fixed-Point_Continuation_for_l1-Minimization_Methodology_and_Convergence","267677183_Oracle_inequalities_in_empirical_risk_minimization_and_sparse_recovery_problems_Ecole_d'Ete_de_Probabilites_de_Saint-Flour_XXXVIII-2008","260365721_On_accelerated_proximal_gradient_methods_for_convex-concave_optimization"]}
