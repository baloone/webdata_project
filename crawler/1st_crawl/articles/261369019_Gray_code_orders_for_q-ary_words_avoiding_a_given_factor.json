{"id":"261369019_Gray_code_orders_for_q-ary_words_avoiding_a_given_factor","abstract":"Based on BRGC inspired order relations we give Gray codes and a generating\nalgorithm for $q$-ary words avoiding a prescribed factor. These generalize an\nearly 2001 result and a very recent one published by some of the present\nauthors, and can be seen as an alternative to those of Squire published in\n1996. Among the involved tools, we make use of generalized BRGC order\nrelations, ultimate periodicity of infinite words, and word matching\ntechniques.","authors":["Antonio Bernini","Stefano Bilotta","Renzo Pinzani","Ahmad Sabri"],"meta":["April 2014Acta Informatica 52(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-015-0225-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265362712_Loop-free_sequencing_of_bounded_integer_compositions","278760940_Two_Gray_codes_for_q-ary_k-generalized_Fibonacci_strings","278387178_Combinatorics_and_computer_science_-_Preface","268317589_Combinatorics_for_computer_science_Reprint_of_the_1985_original","266725818_A_construction_for_a_class_of_binary_words_avoiding_1_j_0_i","262396377_Pattern_1_j1_0_j_Avoiding_Binary_Words","244958006_A_Loopless_Generation_of_Bitstring_without_p_Consecutive_Ones","241278857_Two_Reflected_Gray_Code-Based_Orders_on_Some_Restricted_Growth_Sequences","237005299_Combinatorial_Generation","230805912_Combinatorics_of_Compositions_and_Words"]}
