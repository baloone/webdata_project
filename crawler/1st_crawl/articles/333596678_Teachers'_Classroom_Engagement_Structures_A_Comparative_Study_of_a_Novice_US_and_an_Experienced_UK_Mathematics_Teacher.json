{"id":"333596678_Teachers'_Classroom_Engagement_Structures_A_Comparative_Study_of_a_Novice_US_and_an_Experienced_UK_Mathematics_Teacher","abstract":"This chapter describes the ‘in-the-moment’ affect of one novice and one experienced teacher by building on the contributions of Goldin, Epstein, Schorr, and Warner’s (2011) ‘engagement structure’ archetypes. The two case studies depict the powerful mathematical affect exhibited whilst teaching by describing a constellation of interacting strands within each structure. Findings reveal that engagement structures, first theorised for students, may be inferred from observations across different demographic and professional teaching contexts. We believe the value of engagement structures is in helping teachers notice how their ‘in-the-moment’ behaviour as mathematics teachers may mirror the ‘in-the-moment’ behaviour of their mathematics learners. We suggest engagement structures offer a lens for examining teachers’ affective states, and the role the affective domain can play in teacher education and professional development.","authors":["Deena Khalil","Elizabeth Lake","Ayanna Johnson"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-13761-8_12","In book: Affect and Mathematics Education (pp.255-282)"],"references":["326392769_Learning_Mathematics_and_Technology_Through_Inquiry_Cooperation_and_Communication_A_Learning_Trajectory_for_Future_Mathematics_Teachers","321516912_Attitudes_Beliefs_Motivation_and_Identity_in_Mathematics_Education","305788777_Inconvenient_truths_about_teacher_learning_towards_professional_development_30","303516679_Perspectives_on_emotion_in_mathematical_engagement_learning_and_problem_solving","345188046_Learning_Mathematics_and_Technology_through_Inquiry_Cooperation_and_Communication_A_Learning_Trajectory_for_Future_Mathematics_Teachers","330429963_The_Politics_of_Teaching_Literate_Discourse_Teaching_in_the_Multicultural_Classroom","326954380_Implications_of_Mixed_Reality_and_Simulation_Technologies_on_Special_Education_and_Teacher_Preparation","318494438_Flow_the_psychology_of_optimal_experience","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","316728342_Motivating_Desires_for_Classroom_Engagement_in_the_Learning_of_Mathematics"]}
