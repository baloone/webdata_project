Indeed, an algorithm based on set inversion via interval analysis (SIVIA) combined with interval eigenvalues computation and eigenvalues clustering techniques is proposed to seek for a set of robust gains. This recursive SIVIAbased algorithm allows to approximate with subpaving the set solutions [K] that satisfy the inclusion of the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system in a desired region in the complex plane. Moreover, the LQ tracker design is employed to find from the set solutions [K] the optimal solution that minimizes the inputs/outputs energy and ensures the best behaviors of the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by a real experimentation on a piezoelectric tube actuator.","authors":["Hammouche Mounir","Philippe Lutz","Micky Rakotondrabe"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement and Control 141(2)","DOI:10.1115/1.4040977"],"references":["316586913_Robust_modal_P_and_PI_regulator_synthesis_for_a_plant_with_interval_parameters_in_the_state_space","313890950_Nonlinear_Robust_Output_Stabilization_for_Mechanical_Systems_Based_on_Luenberger-Like_ControllerObserver","311568881_Eigenvalue_bounds_for_symmetric_matrices_with_entries_in_one_interval","309901048_A_comparison_of_particle_swarm_optimization_and_the_genetic_algorithm","303820457_Modern_Control_Systems_8th_Edition","289061857_Robust_pole_assignment_by_state_feedback_control_using_interval_analysis","288725850_Robust_state_feedback_for_interval_systems_An_interval_analysis_approach","281352910_Smart_Materials_Based_Actuators_at_the_MicroNano-Scale_Characterization_Control_and_Applications","278729764_Fast_verified_computation_for_solutions_of_continuous-time_algebraic_Riccati_equations","277089620_Backstepping-based_robust-adaptive_control_of_a_nonlinear_2-DOF_piezoactuator"]}
