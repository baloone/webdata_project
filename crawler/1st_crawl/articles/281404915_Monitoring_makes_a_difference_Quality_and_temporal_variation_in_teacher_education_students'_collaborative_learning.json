{"id":"281404915_Monitoring_makes_a_difference_Quality_and_temporal_variation_in_teacher_education_students'_collaborative_learning","abstract":"The aim of this process-oriented video-observation study is to explore how groups that perform differently differ in terms of the number, quality, and temporal variation of their content-level (knowledge co-construction) and meta-level (monitoring) activities. Five groups of teacher education students (n = 22) were observed throughout a 3-month course. Video recordings (33 hours) of face-to-face group interaction (n = 12,931 speech turns) and pre- and post-tests of students’ knowledge were collected. The results show that the well-performing group was more engaged in high-level knowledge co-construction and monitoring activities. The well-performing group was also capable of maintaining a higher level throughout the tasks, whereas the lower performing groups’ knowledge co-construction and monitoring activities was reduced during the course.","authors":["Piia Näykki","Hanna Järvenoja","Sanna Järvelä","Paul Kirschner"],"meta":["September 2015Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research 61(1)","DOI:10.1080/00313831.2015.1066440"],"references":["344496444_The_relation_between_metacognitive_monitoring_and_control","272177799_Why_Minimal_Guidance_During_Instruction_Does_Not_Work_An_Analysis_of_the_Failure_of_Constructivist_Discovery_Problem-Based_Experiential_and_Inquiry-Based_Teaching","267386757_Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning_for_helping","265602087_Four_Stages_of_Research_on_the_Educational_Use_of_Ubiquitous_Computing","264979434_Sequential_and_temporal_characteristics_of_self_and_socially_regulated_learning","289446280_Metacognition_and_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","284098210_Advancing_understanding_of_collaborative_learning_with_data_derived_from_video_records","282826764_Exploration_of_the_cognitive_regulatory_sub-processes_employed_by_groups_characterized_by_socially_shared_and_other-regulation_in_a_CSCL_context","281331977_Self-regulated_co-regulated_and_socially_share_regulation_of_learning","264560914_Socio-emotional_conflict_in_collaborative_learning-A_process-oriented_case_study_in_a_higher_education_context"]}
