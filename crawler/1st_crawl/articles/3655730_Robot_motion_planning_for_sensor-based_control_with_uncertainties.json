{"id":"3655730_Robot_motion_planning_for_sensor-based_control_with_uncertainties","abstract":"This paper describes a new representation for sensing and control\nuncertainties in sensor-based robot control, and presents motion\nplanning algorithms that use this representation. The planning\nalgorithms employ a robot's sensing capabilities as needed to accomplish\na task, by activating sensors at points or intervals during motion. A\nsensor is represented by three quantities: a domain, which is the set of\nrobot configurations at which a valid measurement can be taken; an\nabsolute sensing uncertainty held, which describes the sensor's absolute\n(global) accuracy; and an incremental motion uncertainty, which\ndescribes the sensor's relative (pertaining to displacements) accuracy.\nControl uncertainty represents the ability of a controller to drive the\nmeasured error near zero. These descriptions of sensing and control\ncapability determine the evolution of uncertainty in a sensor-based\nmotion plan. Two complementary algorithms for motion planning with the\nnew representation are presented. One is a backprojection algorithm\nwhich searches globally (in configuration space and the available\nsensors) for ways to achieve a particular subgoal. The other searches\nlocally (in path space) to satisfy all the constraints in a planning\nproblem. Examples of uncertainty evaluation and motion planning in two\ndegrees of freedom are presented","authors":["L.A. Page","A.C.
