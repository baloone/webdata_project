{"id":"338014261_Solving_Minimum_Vertex_Cover_Problem_Using_DNA_Computing","abstract":"Minimum vertex cover problem is one of classical problem not only in mathematic but also in computer science. However, this problem considered as complex problem since is classify as NP-Hard. This paper proposed new technique based on DNA computing that has good capability to tacked parallel computation. This paper provide new DNA encoding and a set Bio-operation procedure to solve this problem. The result of this technique yield the correct optimum solution with better time complexity ( O (1)) compared the previous algorithms.","authors":["Rofilde Hasudungan","Dwi M. Pangestuty","Asslia J.
