In order to be able to cooperate with various parties was required a deep cooperation. This descriptive qualitative research aims to analyze the cooperation of various parties in the poverty alleviation. The data were collected through interviews with the Poverty Alleviation Coordination Team and the key informant. The results show that cooperation in the poverty alleviation was limited in coordination between work units of the regional apparatus. The coordination was undertaken in the context of programming, implementing, and evaluating of the poverty alleviation. However, the coordination has not been maximized due without involving the private sector and universities who were also members of the poverty alleviation coordination team. The cooperation was more optimal when applying the collaboration principles. Therefore, a deeper cooperation was needed than just coordination, that was, in the form of collaboration. The collaboration in the form of collaboration between various parties could be an innovative strategy in the poverty alleviation.","authors":["Anak Agung Ayu Dewi Larantika","Soesilo Zauhar","Moc.
