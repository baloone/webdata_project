{"id":"283348955_CrowdyQ_A_Virtual_Crowdsourcing_Platform_for_Question_Items_Development_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Developing large-scale exams for a massive number of preparatory year students by a small designated committee of exam developers is a common practice in colleges and universities around the world. However, in adopting this approach, some higher institutions might be confronted with some obstacles such as the unavailability of skilful exam developers and proper resources. To address this issue, we proposed CrowdyQ, a virtual crowdsourcing platform, to investigate the impact of involving a large number of same-subject university instructors in the creation and evaluation of question items in a collaborative manner for the purpose of developing high quality exams. This paper describes the development of CrowdyQ platform and it discusses briefly its potential significance in developing high quality large-scale exam questions in a university context.","authors":["Emad A.
