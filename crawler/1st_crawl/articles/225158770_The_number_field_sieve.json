{"id":"225158770_The_number_field_sieve","abstract":"The number field sieve is an algorithm to factor integers of the form r\ne âˆ’ s for small positive r and |s|. The algorithm depends on arithmetic in an algebraic number field. We describe the algorithm, discuss several aspects of\nits implementation, and present some of the factorizations obtained. A heuristic run time analysis indicates that the number\nfield sieve is asymptotically substantially faster than any other known factoring method, for the integers that it applies\nto. The number field sieve can be modified to handle arbitrary integers. This variant is slower, but asymptotically it is\nstill expected to beat all older factoring methods.","authors":["A. K.
