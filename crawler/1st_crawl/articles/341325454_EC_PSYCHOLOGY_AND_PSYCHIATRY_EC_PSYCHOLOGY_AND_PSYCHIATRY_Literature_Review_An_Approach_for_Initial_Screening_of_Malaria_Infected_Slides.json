The images are collected by modern digital media and these require processing so that meaningful information can be retrieved and collated. Computerized algorithms play a significant role to achieve this goal. Malaria disease identification is an age-old problem that significantly affects a huge population. The paper presents an approach for pre-processing of Malaria infected slides.","authors":["Shawni Dutta","Samir Bandyopadhyay","Samir Kumar","Bandyopadhyay \" An"],"meta":["May 2020"],"references":["320088452_Computer_aided_diagnosis_of_Malaria_disease_for_thin_and_thick_blood_smear_microscopic_images","305646147_Automated_Detection_of_Malaria_Parasites_on_Thick_Blood_Smears_via_Mobile_Devices","276495902_Determination_of_Plasmodium_Parasite_Life_Stages_and_Species_in_Images_of_Thin_Blood_Smears_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network","269810144_Digital_image_analysis_for_automatic_enumeration_of_malaria_parasites_using_morphological_operations","265187062_An_Image_Processing_Approach_for_Accurate_Determination_of_Parasitemia_in_Peripheral_Blood_Smear_Images","313870728_Toward_development_of_automated_plasmodium_detection_for_Malaria_diagnosis_in_thin_blood_smear_image_An_overview","304416879_Feature_extraction_and_classification_for_detection_malaria_parasites_in_thin_blood_smear","304413476_Analysis_of_thin_blood_images_for_automated_malaria_diagnosis","301710088_Automated_detection_of_plasmodium_falciparum_from_Giemsa-stained_thin_blood_films","276152854_Segmentation_of_erythrocytes_infected_with_malaria_parasites_for_the_diagnosis_using_microscopy_imaging","228564413_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_Approaches_for_Detection_of_Malarial_in_Blood_Images","221260079_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Peripheral_Blood_Images","233877022_Machine_learning_approach_for_automated_screening_of_malaria_parasite_using_light_microscopic_images","228440705_Advanced_image_analysis_based_system_for_automatic_detection_and_classification_malarial_parasite_in_blood_images","222153118_Parasite_detection_and_identification_for_automated_thin_blood_film_malaria_diagnosis"]}
