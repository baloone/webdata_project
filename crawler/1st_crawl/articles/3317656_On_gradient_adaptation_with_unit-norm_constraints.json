{"id":"3317656_On_gradient_adaptation_with_unit-norm_constraints","abstract":"In this correspondence, we describe gradient-based adaptive algorithms within parameter spaces that are specified by ||w||=1, where ||/spl middot/|| is any vector norm. We provide several algorithm forms and relate them to true gradient procedures via their geometric structures. We also give algorithms that mitigate an inherent numerical instability for L/sub 2/-norm-constrained optimization tasks. Simulations showing the performance of the techniques for independent component analysis are provided.","authors":["Scott C. Douglas","Shun-ichi Amari","S.-Y.
