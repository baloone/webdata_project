{"id":"290028511_Broadband_Photovoltaic_Detectors_Based_on_an_Atomically_Thin_Heterostructure","abstract":"Van der Waals junctions of two-dimensional materials with an atomically sharp\ninterface open up unprecedented opportunities to design and study functional\nheterostructures. Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have shown\ntremendous potential for future applications due to their unique electronic\nproperties and strong light-matter interaction. However, many important\noptoelectronic applications, such as broadband photodetection, are severely\nhindered by their limited spectral range and reduced light absorption. Here, we\npresent a p-g-n heterostructure formed by sandwiching graphene with a gapless\nbandstructure and wide absorption spectrum in an atomically thin p-n junction\nto overcome these major limitations. We have successfully demonstrated a\nMoS2-graphene-WSe2 heterostructure for broadband photodetection in the visible\nto short-wavelength infrared range at room temperature that exhibits\ncompetitive device performance, including a specific detectivity of up to 1011\nJones in the near-infrared region. Our results pave the way toward the\nimplementation of atomically thin heterostructures for broadband and sensitive\noptoelectronic applications.","authors":["Mingsheng Long","Erfu Liu","Peng Wang","Anyuan Gao"],"meta":["January 2016Nano Letters 16(4)","DOI:10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04538","SourcearXiv","Projects: Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications of 2D MaterialsphotodetectorVan de Waals Heterostructure Based Photodetectors"],"references":["279595660_Highly_responsive_MoS_2_photodetectors_enhanced_by_graphene_quantum_dots","278245168_Ultrasensitive_and_Highly_Selective_Graphene-Based_Single_Yarn_for_Use_in_Wearable_Gas_Sensor","277558176_Polarization-sensitive_broadband_photodetector_using_a_black_phosphorus_vertical_p-n_junction","269997750_Light-emitting_diodes_by_bandstructure_engineering_in_van_der_Waals_heterostructures","266253204_Lateral_epitaxial_growth_of_two-dimensional_layered_semiconductor_heterojunctions","266024288_Waveguide-integrated_black_phosphorus_photodetector_with_high_responsivity_and_low_dark_current","264578130_Atomically_thin_p-n_junctions_with_van_der_Waals_heterointerfaces","264241262_Ultrafast_Charge_Transfer_in_Atomically_Thin_MoS2WS2_Heterostructures","263237743_Strong_light-matter_coupling_in_two-dimensional_atomic_crystals","260645364_Solar-energy_conversion_and_light_emission_in_an_atomic_monolayer_p-n_diode","260645210_Electrically_tunable_excitonic_light-emitting_diodes_based_on_monolayer_WSe2_p-n_junctions","258060923_Graphene-MoS_2_hybrid_structures_for_multifunctional_photoresponsive_memory_devices","237084162_Ultrasensitive_photodetectors_based_on_monolayer_MoS_2","236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","236615077_Strong_Light-Matter_Interactions_in_Heterostructures_of_Atomically_Thin_Films","235634030_CMOS-compatible_graphene_photodetector_covering_all_optical_communication_bands","235603840_Electrical_control_of_neutral_and_charged_excitons_in_a_monolayer_semiconductor","233976798_Vertical_field-effect_transistor_based_on_graphene-WS_2_heterostructures_for_flexible_and_transparent_electronics","230581909_Cross-sectional_imaging_of_individual_layers_and_buried_interfaces_of_graphene-based_heterostructures_and_superlattices","227175552_Control_of_valley_polarization_in_monolayer_MoS","221801702_Field-Effect_Tunneling_Transistor_Based_on_Vertical_Graphene_Heterostructures","49796080_Single-layer_MoS2_transistors","49751374_Atomically_Thin_MoS_2_A_New_Direct-Gap_Semiconductor","46586774_Graphene_photodetectors_for_high-speed_optical_communications","311508864_Electrical_Control_of_Neutral_and_Charged_Excitons_in_a_Monolayer_Semiconductor","287853593_High_Responsivity_Phototransistors_Based_on_Few-Layer_ReS2_for_Weak_Signal_Detection","270966054_Probing_the_electron_states_and_metal-insulator_transition_mechanisms_in_molybdenum_disulphide_vertical_heterostructures","267759976_Optically_Active_Quantum_Dots_in_Monolayer_WSe_2","267046360_Two-Dimensional_Material_Nanophotonics","266624068_Photodetectors_based_on_graphene_other_two-dimensional_materials_and_hybrid_systems","263811777_Black_Phosphorus_Photodetector_for_Multispectral_High-Resolution_Imaging","260842151_Graphene_photodetectors_with_ultra-broadband_and_high_responsivity_at_room_temperature","260716303_Photovoltaic_Effect_in_an_Electrically_Tunable_van_der_Waals_Heterojunction","258102807_Highly_efficient_gate-tunable_photocurrent_generation_in_vertical_heterostructures_of_layered_materials","256855680_Optical_spectroscopy_of_graphene_From_the_far_infrared_to_the_ultraviolet","236079277_Role_of_Metal_Contacts_in_Designing_High-Performance_Monolayer_n-Type_WSe2_Field_Effect_Transistors","233929178_High_Performance_Multilayer_MoS2_Transistors_with_Scandium_Contacts","47546194_High-Gain_Graphene-Titanium_Oxide_Photoconductor_Made_from_Inkjet_Printable_Ionic_Solution","41967633_Emerging_Photoluminescence_in_Monolayer_MoS2","26741063_High-Detectivity_Polymer_Photodetectors_with_Spectral_Response_from_300_nm_to_1450_nm","6278180_Imaging_of_the_Schottky_Barriers_and_Charge_Depletion_in_Carbon_Nanotube_Transistors"]}
