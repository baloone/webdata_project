{"id":"316895794_Teacher_Feedback_on_Delivering_Computational_Thinking_in_Primary_School","abstract":"We report on the preliminary results of an ongoing study examining the teaching of new primary school topics based on Computational Thinking in New Zealand. We analyse detailed feedback from 13 teachers participating in the study, who had little or no previous experience teaching computer science and related topics. From this we extract key themes identified by the teachers that are likely to be encountered deploying a new curriculum, including unexpected opportunities for cross-curricula learning, development of social skills, and engaging a wide range of students.","authors":["Tim Bell","Caitlin Duncan","James Atlas"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2978249.2978266","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education"],"references":["301463451_A_Pilot_Computer_Science_and_Programming_Course_for_Primary_School_Students","262403769_Computer_Science_Unplugged_and_Related_Projects_in_Math_and_Computer_Science_Popularization"]}
