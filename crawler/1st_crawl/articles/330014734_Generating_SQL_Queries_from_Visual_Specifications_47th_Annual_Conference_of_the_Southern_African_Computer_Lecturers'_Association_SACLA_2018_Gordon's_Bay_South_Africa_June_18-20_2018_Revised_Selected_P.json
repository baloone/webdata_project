Despite the intuitiveness of SQL, formulating and comprehending written queries can be confusing, especially for undergraduate students. One major reason for this is that the simple syntax of SQL is often misleading and hard to comprehend. A number of tools have been developed to aid the comprehension of queries and to improve the mental models of students concerning the underlying logic of SQL. Some of these tools employed visualisation and animation in their approach to aid the comprehension of SQL. This paper presents an interactive comprehension aid based on visualisation, specifically designed to support the SQL SELECT statement, an area identified in the literature as problematic for students. The visualisation tool uses visual specifications depicting SQL operations to build queries. This is expected to reduce the cognitive load of a student who is learning SQL. We have shown with an online survey that adopting visual specifications in teaching systems assist students in attaining a richer learning experience in introductory database courses.","authors":["George Obaido","Abejide Ade-Ibijola","Hima Vadapalli"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-05813-5_21","In book: ICT Education (pp.315-330)","Project: New Industrial Applications of Formal Language and Automata Theory"],"references":["315848998_A_Serious_Game_for_Learning_C_Programming_Language_Concepts_Using_Solo_Taxonomy","277007765_Mastering_The_Information_Age_-_Solving_Problems_with_Visual_Analytics","269167794_Abstracting_and_Narrating_Novice_Programs_Using_Regular_Expressions","261023295_Drag-and-Drop_Refactoring_Intuitive_Program_Transformation","259762558_eledSQL_A_New_Web-based_Learning_Environment_for_Teaching_Databases_and_SQL_at_Secondary_School_Level","234803601_A_CS0_course_using_Scratch","221644111_The_impact_of_the_skills_gap_on_the_recruitment_of_MIS_graduates","221152546_Computer_Assisted_Assessment_of_SQL_Query_Skills","220862543_Teaching_SQL_-_Which_Pedagogical_Horse_for_This_Course","220808515_The_backwash_effect_on_SQL_skills_grading","220808351_SQLator_an_online_SQL_learning_workbench","220707159_SAVI_a_new_system_for_advanced_SQL_visualization","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","38413358_Scratch_for_Budding_Computer_Scientists","38319259_An_intelligent_SQL_tutor_on_the_web","32229458_An_intelligent_SQL_tutor_on_the_web","5878332_A_Taxonomy_of_Clutter_Reduction_for_Information_Visualisation","2551403_Teaching_Objects-first_In_Introductory_Computer_Science","317423098_Block-C_A_block-based_programming_teaching_tool_to_facilitate_introductory_C_programming_courses","313609162_A_query_simulation_system_to_illustrate_database_query_execution","311489595_Students'_Syntactic_Mistakes_in_Writing_Seven_Different_Types_of_SQL_Queries_and_its_Application_to_Predicting_Students'_Success","311474831_A_query_simulation_system_to_illustrate_database_query_execution","301408647_An_appraisal_to_optimize_SQL_queries","300549000_Using_Visual_Organizers_and_Technology_Supporting_Executive_Function_Abstract_Language_Comprehension_and_Social_Learning","286660984_Formulating_second-order_logic_conditions_in_SQL","266654957_A_visual_learning_tool_for_database_operation","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","263858813_Lyra_An_Interactive_Visualization_Design_Environment","262213779_3D_game_design_with_programming_blocks_in_StarLogo_TNG","243779792_What_computer_skills_do_employers_expect_from_recent_college_graduates_T","242819512_The_art_of_human-computer_interface_design","242393297_Learning_to_Program_with_Alice","239062196_Learning_to_Program_with_Alice_Prentice-Hall","222430987_Assessing_the_contribution_of_color_in_visual_attention_Comput_Vis_Image_Und_100_107-123","221222929_A_teaching_system_for_SQL","221103631_QueryViz_Helping_users_understand_SQL_queries_and_their_patterns","220691167_Programming_C_sharp_-_building_NET_applications","30012632_Visual_Analytics_Scope_and_Challenges","3844744_What_are_we_doing_when_we_teach_programming"]}
