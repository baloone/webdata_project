{"id":"256606135_Matching_colored_points_with_rectangles","abstract":"Let $S$ be a point set in the plane such that each of its elements is colored\neither red or blue. A monochromatic strong matching of $S$ with rectangles is\nany set of pairwise disjoint axis-aligned rectangles such that each rectangle\ncontains exactly two points of $S$ from the same color class, and every element\nof $S$ is contained in at most one rectangle. In this paper we study the\nproblem of finding a maximum monochromatic strong matching set of rectangles.\nWe prove that this problem is NP-hard and provide an algorithm that constructs\na matching with at least1/16$ of the number of rectangles of an optimal\nmatching. These results extend previous ones on matching one-colored points\nwith rectangles and squares, and matching two-colored points with straight\nsegments.","authors":["L. E.
