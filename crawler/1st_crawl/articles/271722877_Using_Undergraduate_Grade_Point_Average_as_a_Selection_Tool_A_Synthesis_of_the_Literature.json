{"id":"271722877_Using_Undergraduate_Grade_Point_Average_as_a_Selection_Tool_A_Synthesis_of_the_Literature","abstract":"As educational attainment becomes increasingly more important in employment settings, undergraduate grade point average (GPA) will persist in being an attractive selection tool. It is important that recruitment professionals understand the implications of the use of this measure. Thus, this article aims to unify the GPA literature in order to offer guidelines for practice based on current research. Common themes within the literature are reviewed to address topics such as what GPA reflects as well as the reliability and accuracy of the measure. Employment professionals are urged to consider how using GPA impacts fairness and accuracy in selection. As such, the recommendations are designed to help practitioners understand the limitations associated with the use of GPA in order to maximize both fairness and accuracy.","authors":["Ruth A.
