{"id":"353433736_Optimization_of_Intelligent_Controllers_Using_a_Type-1_and_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","abstract":"This article focuses on the dynamic parameter adaptation in the harmony search algorithm using Type-1 and interval Type-2 fuzzy logic. In particular, this work focuses on the adaptation of the parameters of the original harmony search algorithm. At present there are several types of algorithms that can solve complex real-world problems with uncertainty management. In this case the proposed method is in charge of optimizing the membership functions of three benchmark control problems (water tank, shower, and mobile robot). The main goal is to find the best parameters for the membership functions in the controller to follow a desired trajectory. Noise experiments are performed to test the efficacy of the method.","authors":["Cinthia Peraza","Fevrier Valdez","Patricia Melin"],"meta":["July 2017Algorithms 10(3):82","DOI:10.3390/a10030082"],"references":["333823436_Dynamic_parameter_adaptation_in_the_harmony_search_algorithm_for_the_optimization_of_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_controllers","312643707_Imperialist_Competitive_Algorithm_with_Dynamic_Parameter_Adaptation_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_Applied_to_the_Optimization_of_Mathematical_Functions","309164287_A_New_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Dynamic_Parameter_Adaptation","311916982_Ant_colony_optimization_with_dynamic_parameter_adaptation_based_on_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems","311557485_Optimization_Mathematical_Functions_for_Multiple_Variables_Using_the_Algorithm_of_Self-defense_of_the_Plants","311555548_An_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_Based_on_Harmony_Search_and_Its_Application_to_Optimization","309918411_Interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_for_dynamic_parameter_adaptation_in_the_Harmony_search_algorithm","306304165_A_Harmony_Search-Firefly_Algorithm_Based_Controller_for_Damping_Power_Oscillations","303537512_Optimization_by_Cuckoo_Search_of_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Systems_for_Edge_Detection","300116943_Differential_Evolution_with_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Dynamic_Adaptation_of_Parameters_in_Mathematical_Function_Optimization"]}
