{"id":"339847635_New_Fuzzy_Divergence_Measure_and_Its_Applications_in_Multi-criteria_Decision-Making_Using_New_Tool","abstract":"Fuzzy set theory is well suited for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness. In this research paper, we introduced new convex function, new fuzzy divergence measure and its generalization with the proof of its validity. Further, we established relations between new and well-known fuzzy divergence measures. Also, we discussed applications of new fuzzy divergence measure in multi-criteria decision-making using a new tool and its comparison with the TOPSIS method.","authors":["R. N.
