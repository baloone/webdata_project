{"id":"324124307_Policy_brief_as_a_knowledge_transfer_tool_to_make_a_splash_your_policy_brief_must_first_be_read","abstract":"Since 2010, the research teams that we work with have produced dozens of policy briefs (PB) with the purpose of informing the various stakeholders of the results of our studies and their usefulness regarding public health practices, decision-making and policy change. Because they are only aids to decision-making, \"A policy brief is just a piece of paper, it doesn't DO anything on its own\", preparing these PBs should always form part of a broader knowledge transfer process. Therefore, they often serve as discussion tools during deliberative workshops focusing on the manner in which the results could be incorporated into practices and public policies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a guide for preparing policy briefs, which we have used with researchers over and over again in our training workshops. This training was offered in different formats lasting from three hours to two days. In this editorial, we use our different experiences to put forward a PB format intended for a non-scientific audience, to act as an influence on practices and policy-making.","authors":["Christian Dagenais","Val√©ry Ridde"],"meta":["March 2018Gaceta Sanitaria 32(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.gaceta.2018.02.003"],"references":["321702806_What_we_have_learnt_so_far_about_deliberative_dialogue_for_evidence-based_policymaking_in_West_Africa","321343002_How_to_communicate_effectively_with_policymakers_Combine_insights_from_psychology_and_policy_studies","321060670_The_effectiveness_of_research_implementation_strategies_for_promoting_evidence-informed_policy_and_management_decisions_in_healthcare_A_systematic_review","317335598_Research_dissemination_workshops_Observations_and_implications_based_on_an_experience_in_Burkina_Faso","237773531_Policy_Briefs_as_a_Communication_Tool_for_Development_Research","318651201_Using_Policy_Briefs_to_Present_Scientific_Results_of_CBPR_Farmworkers_in_North_Carolina","259550399_What_Do_Policymakers_Want_From_Us_Results_of_a_Survey_of_Current_and_Former_Senior_National_Security_Decision_Makers","256539627_How_Contexts_and_Issues_Influence_the_Use_of_Policy-Relevant_Research_Syntheses_A_Critical_Interpretive_Synthesis","44833537_Writing_effective_public_policy_papers_a_guide_for_policy_advisers_in_Central_and_Eastern_Europe","5624393_How_do_drug_policy_makers_access_research_evidence"]}
