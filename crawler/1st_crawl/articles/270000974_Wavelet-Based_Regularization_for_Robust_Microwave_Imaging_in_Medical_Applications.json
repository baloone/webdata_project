{"id":"270000974_Wavelet-Based_Regularization_for_Robust_Microwave_Imaging_in_Medical_Applications","abstract":"Microwave imaging (MWI) is an emerging tool for medical diagnostics, potentially offering unique advantages such as the capability of providing quantitative images of the inspected tissues. This involves, however, solving a challenging non-linear and ill-posed electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. This paper presents a robust method for quantitative microwave imaging in medical applications where very little, if any, a priori information on the imaging scenario is available. This is accomplished by employing a distorted Born iterative method (DBIM) and a regularization by projection technique, which reconstructs the tissue parameters using a wavelet basis expansion to represent the unknown contrast. This approach is suited for any microwave medical imaging application where the requirement for increased resolution dictates the use of higher frequency data, and consequently, a robust regularization strategy. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach, the paper presents reconstructions of highly heterogeneous anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms in a canonical two-dimensional (2-D) configuration.","authors":["Rosa Scapaticci","Panagiotis Kosmas","Lorenzo Crocco"],"meta":["December 2014IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering 62(4)","DOI:10.1109/TBME.2014.2381270","SourcePubMed"],"references":["263386573_Microwave_open-ended_coaxial_dielectric_probe_Interpretation_of_the_sensing_volume_re-visited","258380868_A_Contrast_Source_Inversion_Algorithm_Formulated_Using_the_Log-Phase_Formulation","258275481_A_contrast_source_inversion_method_in_the_wavelet_domain","313061242_A_theory_for_multiresolution_signal_decomposition_The_wavelet_representation","261237395_Utilization_of_multiple_frequencies_in_3D_nonlinear_microwave_imaging","260332777_Microwave_Imaging_for_Breast_Cancer","258793367_Microwave_Breast_Imaging_With_a_Monostatic_Radar-Based_System_A_Study_of_Application_to_Patients","258655886_Wavelet-Based_Adaptive_Multiresolution_Inversion_for_Quantitative_Microwave_Imaging_of_Breast_Tissues","248540894_A_Theory_of_Multiresolution_Signal_Decomposition_The_Wavelet_Representation","246535168_Inverse_Acoustic_and_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Theory_Appl_Math_Sci"]}
