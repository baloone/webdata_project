For example, ribbon graphs and their counting is of great interest in string theory and quantum field theory (QFT). Recently, Koch, Ramgoolam, and Wen [Nuclear Phys.B 870 (2013), 530–581] gave a refined formula for counting ribbon graphs and discussed its applications to several physics problems. An important factor in this formula is the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms from a co-compact Fuchsian group to a cyclic group. The aim of this paper is to give an explicit and practical formula for the number of such epimorphisms. As a consequence, we obtain an ‘equivalent’ form of the famous Harvey’s theorem on the cyclic groups of automorphisms of compact Riemann surfaces. Our main tool is an explicit formula for the number of solutions of restricted linear congruence recently proved by Bibak et al. using properties of Ramanujan sums and of the finite Fourier transform of arithmetic functions.","authors":["Khodakhast Bibak","Bruce M.
