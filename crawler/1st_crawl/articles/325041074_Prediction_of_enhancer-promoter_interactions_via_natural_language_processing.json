{"id":"325041074_Prediction_of_enhancer-promoter_interactions_via_natural_language_processing","abstract":"Background: \nPrecise identification of three-dimensional genome organization, especially enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs), is important to deciphering gene regulation, cell differentiation and disease mechanisms. Currently, it is a challenging task to distinguish true interactions from other nearby non-interacting ones since the power of traditional experimental methods is limited due to low resolution or low throughput.\n\nResults: \nWe propose a novel computational framework EP2vec to assay three-dimensional genomic interactions. We first extract sequence embedding features, defined as fixed-length vector representations learned from variable-length sequences using an unsupervised deep learning method in natural language processing. Then, we train a classifier to predict EPIs using the learned representations in supervised way. Experimental results demonstrate that EP2vec obtains F1 scores ranging from 0.841~ 0.933 on different datasets, which outperforms existing methods. We prove the robustness of sequence embedding features by carrying out sensitivity analysis. Besides, we identify motifs that represent cell line-specific information through analysis of the learned sequence embedding features by adopting attention mechanism. Last, we show that even superior performance with F1 scores 0.889~ 0.940 can be achieved by combining sequence embedding features and experimental features.\n\nConclusions: \nEP2vec sheds light on feature extraction for DNA sequences of arbitrary lengths and provides a powerful approach for EPIs identification.","authors":["Wanwen Zeng","Mengmeng Wu","Rui Jiang"],"meta":["May 2018BMC Genomics 19(S2)","DOI:10.1186/s12864-018-4459-6"],"references":["345822937_Predicting_Enhancer-Promoter_Interaction_from_Genomic_Sequence_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","323663939_Chromatin_accessibility_prediction_via_convolutional_long_short-term_memory_networks_with_k-mer_embedding","319958073_Mimvec_A_deep_learning_approach_for_analyzing_the_human_phenome","317329794_Modeling_gene_regulation_from_paired_expression_and_chromatin_accessibility_data","306213025_A_3D_Map_of_the_Human_Genome_at_Kilobase_Resolution_Reveals_Principles_of_Chromatin_Looping","306126884_Modulation_of_long_noncoding_RNAs_by_risk_SNPs_underlying_genetic_predispositions_to_prostate_cancer","297752707_Constructing_3D_interaction_maps_from_1D_epigenomes","332636416_Predicting_enhancer-promoter_interaction_from_genomic_sequence_with_deep_neural_networks","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","301217500_Enhancer-promoter_interactions_are_encoded_by_complex_genomic_signatures_on_looping_chromatin"]}
