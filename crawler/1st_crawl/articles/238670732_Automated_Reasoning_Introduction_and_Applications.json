{"id":"238670732_Automated_Reasoning_Introduction_and_Applications","abstract":"This book is designed to explain how to use a computer program that automates reasoning. Papers 1 through 5 provide a complete introduction to automated reasoning, followed by a review of the basic concepts in paper 6. In this book the authors introduce to a language for stating problems to an automated reasoning program and to many considerations affecting its performance. They explain about the various ways such a program reasons and how it is intelligent. The authors discuss the application of automated reasoning to designing logic circuits, proving properties of other programs, assisting in research in abstract mathematics and in formal logic, among others. The contents are: Introduction, learning logic by example. Puzzles, alternative representation and equality, harder puzzles, summary and partial formalization, logic circuit design, logic circuit validation. Research in mathematics, research in formal logic, real-time systems control, program debugging and verification, expert systems. Prolog: logic as a programming language. The formal treatment of automated reasoning, and the art of automated reasoning.","authors":["Larry Wos","R.
