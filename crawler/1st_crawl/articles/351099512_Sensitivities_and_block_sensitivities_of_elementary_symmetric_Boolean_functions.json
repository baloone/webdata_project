{"id":"351099512_Sensitivities_and_block_sensitivities_of_elementary_symmetric_Boolean_functions","abstract":"Boolean functions have important applications in molecular regulatory networks, engineering, cryptography, information technology, and computer science. Symmetric Boolean functions have received a lot of attention in several decades. Sensitivity and block sensitivity are important complexity measures of Boolean functions. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of elementary symmetric Boolean functions and obtain many explicit formulas. We also obtain a formula for the block sensitivity of symmetric Boolean functions and discuss its applications in elementary symmetric Boolean functions.","authors":["Jing Zhang","Yuan li","John O.
