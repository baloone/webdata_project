{"id":"37153737_The_Mismanagement_of_Talent_Employability_and_Jobs_in_the_Knowledge_Economy","abstract":"The challenge confronting governments around the world today is to enhance the employability of the workforce. Every effort must be made to expand access to higher education, disregard social circumstances, gender, and other such barriers to talent, and to harness human creativity and enterprise to meet the demands of the new economy. However, people who have attained higher education are having trouble finding jobs, with rising stakes for the winners and losers. This book examines what determines the outcome of this race when a degree loses its badge of distinction. It shows how some graduates are playing 'the game' to win a competitive advantage, and what really happens in the selection events of leading-edge employers. It also argues that talent is being mismanaged by employers that have yet to come to terms with the realities and possibilities of mass higher education.","authors":["Phillip Brown","Anthony Hesketh"],"meta":["June 2005Industrial and Labor Relations Review 50(2)","DOI:10.2189/asqu.2005.50.2.306","SourceOAI"],"references":["247497411_Knowledge_as_Work_Conflicts_in_the_Management_of_Knowledge_Workers","249730177_Making_the_Economic_HabitusAlgerian_Workers_Revisited","248975577_Towards_an_Economic_Sociology_of_the_Student_Financial_Experience_of_Higher_Education","248975435_Do_Employers_Need_the_Skills_They_Want_Evidence_from_technical_work","243674942_Graduate_Utilisation_In_British_Industry_The_Initial_Impact_Of_Mass_Higher_Education","235280959_The_value_of_knowledge_and_the_values_of_the_new_knowledge_worker_Generation_X_in_the_new_economy","233368067_History_place_and_the_learning_society_Towards_a_sociology_of_lifetime_learning","228731404_Development_after_industrialization_Poor_countries_in_an_electronically_integrated_global_economy","50432744_Ignorant_Theory_and_Knowledgeable_Workers_Interrogating_the_Connections_Between_Knowledge_Skills_and_Services","45348024_Narratives_of_Identity_in_Modern_Management_The_Corrosion_of_Gender_Difference","44829702_Overqualification_in_Employment","4876936_Disciplining_the_shopfloor_A_comparison_of_the_disciplinary_effects_of_managerial_psychology_and_financial_accounting","27650299_Developing_a_Political_Economy_of_Skill","8668153_Sociology_and_Political_Arithmetic_Some_Principles_of_a_New_Policy_Science"]}
