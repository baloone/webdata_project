{"id":"314152161_Coordinated_Pluralism_as_a_Means_to_Facilitate_Integrative_Taxonomies_of_Cognition","abstract":"The past decade has witnessed a growing awareness of conceptual and methodological hurdles within psychology and neuroscience that must be addressed for taxonomic and explanatory progress in understanding psychological functions to be possible. In this paper, I evaluate several recent knowledge-building initiatives aimed at overcoming these obstacles. I argue that while each initiative offers important insights about how to facilitate taxonomic and explanatory progress in psychology and neuroscience, only a “coordinated pluralism” that incorporates positive aspects of each initiative will have the potential for success.","authors":["Jacqueline Anne Sullivan"],"meta":["May 2017Philosophical Explorations Issue 20(2):129-145","DOI:10.1080/13869795.2017.1312497"],"references":["322026109_Philosophy_of_psychiatry_after_diagnostic_kinds","310507406_Construct_Stabilization_and_the_Unity_of_the_Mind-Brain_Sciences","308016948_Repertoires_A_post-Kuhnian_perspective_on_scientific_change_and_collaborative_research","306072165_What_are_neural_correlates_neural_correlates_of","304681043_Is_the_Next_Frontier_in_Neuroscience_a_'Decade_of_the_Mind'","304537545_Stabilizing_Constructs_through_Collaboration_across_Different_Research_Fields_as_a_Way_to_Foster_the_Integrative_Approach_of_the_Research_Domain_Criteria_RDoC_Project","313493106_Neuroscience_Needs_Behavior_Correcting_a_Reductionist_Bias","311647121_Construct_Stabilization_and_the_Unity_of_the_Mind-Brain_Sciences","309256072_Open_data_Curation_is_under-resourced","303855221_The_experimenters'_regress_reconsidered_Replication_tacit_knowledge_and_the_dynamics_of_knowledge_generation"]}
