{"id":"301796219_Discrepancies_between_Student_Perception_and_Achievement_of_Learning_Outcomes_in_a_Flipped_Classroom","abstract":"In a college algebra course that used flipped/inverted pedagogy, students achieved learning outcomes at a significantly higher rate, as evidenced by results on the final exam. At the same time, student perception on a number of measures decreased significantly, including how interested students were in the course and whether the instructor effectively facilitated learning. This article will draw on a variety of research to suggest reasons for these discrepancies and possible solutions to help improve student perception in learner-centered instruction.","authors":["Jenna R Van Sickle"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning 16(2):29","DOI:10.14434/josotl.v16i2.19216"],"references":["274454860_Learner-centered_environments_Creating_effective_strategies_based_on_student_attitudes_and_faculty_reflection","268343472_The_Validity_of_Student_Course_Evaluations_An_Eternal_Debate","262267588_Active_Learning_Increases_Student_Performance_in_Science_Engineering_and_Mathematics","341812808_FIVE_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_LEARNER-CENTERED_TEACHING","306155719_How_flippingthe_classroom_can_improve_the_traditional_lecture","298104704_How_flipping_the_classroom_can_improve_the_traditional_lecture_The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education","283670853_Adventures_in_Flipping_College_Algebra","281453155_Mindset_The_New_Psychology_of_Success","259982152_Daring_Greatly_How_the_Courage_to_Be_Vulnerable_Transforms_the_Way_We_Live_Love_Parent_and_Lead","239571518_Student_Course_Evaluations_Research_Models_and_Trends"]}
