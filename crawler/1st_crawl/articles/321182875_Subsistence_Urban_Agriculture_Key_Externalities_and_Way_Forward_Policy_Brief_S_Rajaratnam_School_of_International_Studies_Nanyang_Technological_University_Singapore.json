As a result, many of the urban poor have started to grow their own food as a way to feed their families and use the income saved to cover non-food household needs. However, in most cities, their efforts are not recognized in policies or supported. This policy brief identifies public health and food security implications of this lack of public oversight on urban farming. Policy recommendations on managing the externalities of urban agriculture and best practices for getting urban agriculture on the policy agenda are discussed.","authors":["Stella Liu","Paul P.S.
