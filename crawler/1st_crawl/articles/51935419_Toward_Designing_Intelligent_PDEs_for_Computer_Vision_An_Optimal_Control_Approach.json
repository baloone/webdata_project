{"id":"51935419_Toward_Designing_Intelligent_PDEs_for_Computer_Vision_An_Optimal_Control_Approach","abstract":"Many computer vision and image processing problems can be posed as solving\npartial differential equations (PDEs). However, designing PDE system usually\nrequires high mathematical skills and good insight into the problems. In this\npaper, we consider designing PDEs for various problems arising in computer\nvision and image processing in a lazy manner: \\emph{learning PDEs from real\ndata via data-based optimal control}. We first propose a general intelligent\nPDE system which holds the basic translational and rotational invariance rule\nfor most vision problems. By introducing a PDE-constrained optimal control\nframework, it is possible to use the training data resulting from multiple ways\n(ground truth, results from other methods, and manual results from humans) to\nlearn PDEs for different computer vision tasks. The proposed optimal control\nbased training framework aims at learning a PDE-based regressor to approximate\nthe unknown (and usually nonlinear) mapping of different vision tasks. The\nexperimental results show that the learnt PDEs can solve different vision\nproblems reasonably well. In particular, we can obtain PDEs not only for\nproblems that traditional PDEs work well but also for problems that PDE-based\nmethods have never been tried before, due to the difficulty in describing those\nproblems in a mathematical way.","authors":["Risheng Liu","Zhouchen Lin","Wayne Zhang","Kewei Tang"],"meta":["September 2011Image and Vision Computing 31(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.imavis.2012.09.004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313208541_Boundary_detection_by_minimizing_functionals","303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","263069716_A_Variational_Approach_to_Remove_Outliers_and_Impulse_Noise","225881207_Fast_Global_Minimization_of_the_Active_ContourSnake_Model","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","220720382_Image_inpainting","220695437_Algorithms_for_Image_Processing_and_Computer_Vision","220184136_Color2Gray_Salience-preserving_color_removal","216792737_Scaling_learning_algorithms_towards_AI","200744514_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","4156209_Level_set_evolution_without_re-initialization_A_new_variational_formulation","4022865_Vector-Valued_Image_Regularization_with_PDE's_A_Common_Framework_for","285641243_Image_Processing_and_Analysis_Variational_PDE_Wavelet_and_Stochastic_Methods","269950118_Optimal_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Partial_Differential_Equations","267077002_Geometric_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_Image_Analysis","259572492_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","243776403_Aspects_of_total_variation_regularized_L1_function_approximation","243772916_Approximation_of_functionals_depending_on_jumps_by_elliptic_functionals_via_G-convergence","243658322_Feature-Oriented_Image_Enhancement_Using_Shock_Filters","235409954_Field_and_Wave_Electromagnetics","226857211_Partial_differential_equations_and_finite-difference_methods_in_image_processing_part_1_Image_representation","225180015_Learning_PDEs_for_Image_Restoration_via_Optimal_Control","224153225_Optimal_Control-Based_Strategy_for_Sensor_Deployment","221110306_Distributed_Cosegmentation_via_Submodular_Optimization_on_Anisotropic_Diffusion","220728835_Total_Variation_Minimization_and_a_Class_of_Binary_MRF_Models","220694041_Image_Processing_and_Analysis_Variational_PDE_Wavelet_and_Stochastic_Methods","220222733_Aspects_of_Total_Variation_Regularized_L_1_Function_Approximation","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","216225269_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_Solitary_Waves_Theory","215618134_Optimal_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Partial_Different_Equations","201841044_Scaling_learning_algorithms_towards","200175449_Applications_of_Lie_groups_to_differential_equations_2nd_ed","46578160_A_Relay_Level_Set_Method_for_Automatic_Image_Segmentation","44352605_Optimal_control_theory_an_introduction_Donald_E_Kirk","16718285_The_Structure_of_Images","7972771_Demosaicing_by_successive_approximation","7942076_Deriche_R_Vector-valued_image_regularization_with_PDEs_a_common_framework_for_different_applications_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Machine_Intell_27_506-517","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","6520508_Demosaicing_With_Directional_Filtering_and_a_posteriori_Decision","5602067_Color_plane_interpolation_using_alternating_projections","3948738_Color_plane_interpolation_using_alternating_projections","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3666089_Geometric_partial_differential_equations_in_image_analysis_past_present_and_future","3191811_Scale-Space_And_Edge_Detection_Using_Anisotropic_Diffusion","3026499_Optimal_control_theory_An_introduction","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","2438455_Edge-preserving_and_Scale-dependent_Properties_of_Total_Variation_Regularization"]}
