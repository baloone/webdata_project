{"id":"320847656_Reducing_Impact_of_Negative_Complexity_on_Sustainability_of_Mass_Customization","abstract":"In the mass customization environment, product platform development includes several aspects. One relates to the extent to which products are customized. Usually, a high level of product variety brings significant benefits to customers. On the other hand, a high degree of product customization may have a negative environmental impact during production, due to higher material usage. One possible way to reduce the impact is eliminating infeasible configuration options, caused by incompatibilities between optional component types, within a product platform. Such optional components are a source of negative complexity. However, a reduction of optional component types within a product platform can lead to decreasing the extent of the variety of a product to an undesirable level. An effective way of finding this optimal level of reduction is to quantify and analyze the rates between positive and negative complexities, which are related to the numbers of configuration options. The method for this purpose is presented in this paper.","authors":["Vladimir Modrak","Zuzana Šoltysová","Jan Modrak","Annamária Behúnová"],"meta":["November 2017Sustainability 9(11):2014","DOI:10.3390/su9112014"],"references":["312529316_Designing_Business_Models_for_Sustainable_Mass_Customization_A_Framework_Proposal","288826943_Approaches_to_Product_Variety_Management_Assuming_Configuration_Conflict_Problem","347925314_A_Quantitative_Approach_to_Determining_Product_Platform_Extent","327548481_Mass_Customized_Manufacturing_Theoretical_Concepts_and_Practical_Approaches","314219718_Chapter_one_An_introduction_to_mass_customized_manufacturingMatt_and_Erwin_Rauch_Theoretical_Concepts_and_Practical_Approaches","305847760_Sustainable_production_in_emerging_markets_through_Distributed_Manufacturing_Systems_DMS","303867267_Pleasure_From_Anothers_Pain_The_Influence_of_a_Targets_Hedonic_States_on_Attributions_of_Immorality_and_Evil","289379862_Determining_Product_Platform_Extent","284887569_Design_Space_Configuration_for_Minimizing_Design_Information_Entropy","283793002_Roots_of_brutality"]}
