{"id":"316323913_Methodology_for_Monitoring_Manufacturing_Environment_by_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_WSN_and_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT","abstract":"Manufacturing currently faces tremendous potentials with the rapid development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT). As one example, a real-time application for environment monitoring in manufacturing will offer the opportunity to improve its resource and energy efficiency. This requires a structured approach to integrating both WSN and IoT. Although established technology exists, there is a lack of methodology to construct multiple hardware and software platforms and interoperate them effectively. Thus, this paper presents a two-step framework in order to first design a system architecture and then to determine selection criteria for each component. A case study for temperature monitoring is presented for a proof-of-concept.","authors":["Wen Li","Sami Kara"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 61:323-328","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2016.11.182"],"references":["278243805_Medical_Applications_Based_on_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","256673856_Towards_energy_and_resource_efficient_manufacturing_A_processes_and_systems_approach","301888287_That_'Internet_of_Things'_Thing","286662642_Research_on_warehouse_environment_monitoring_system_based_on_wireless_sensor_network","284054831_The_internet_of_things","270818913_Sensor_Technology_Handbook","260414240_Internet_of_Things","251551394_Energy_oriented_simulation_of_manufacturing_systems_-_Concept_and_application","251123571_Die_organisatorische_Gestaltung_interner_Dienstleistungen_durch_Serviceorientierte_Unternehmensstrukturen","238010164_Evolution_of_wireless_sensor_networks_towards_the_Internet_of_Things_A_survey"]}
