{"id":"243026103_Sub-shadowings","abstract":"An extended concept of δ pseudo-orbit called δ-ergodic pseudo-orbit is considered. If any δ-ergodic pseudo-orbit of a system is shadowed by a point along a set of positive lower density then we show that this system is chain mixing and if it is minimal then it is topologically weakly mixing and so has Li–Yorke Chaos. A SFT has this property if and only if it is mixing.","authors":["Dawoud Ahmadi Dastjerdi","Maryam Hosseini"],"meta":["May 2010Nonlinear Analysis 72(9):3759-3766","DOI:10.1016/j.na.2010.01.014"],"references":["235719768_Li-Yorke_sensitivity","227963010_Subshift_attractors_of_cellular_automata","226579605_LI-Yorke_sensitivity_and_other_concepts_of_chaos","270308944_Iteration_of_Rational_Functions","267112175_Algebra_in_the_Stone-Cech_compactification_Theory_and_applications_2nd_revised_and_extended_ed","266291654_Topological_Anosov_maps_of_non-compact_metric_spaces","265715083_Minimal_idempotents_and_ergodic_Ramsey_theory","265462357_Topological_theory_of_dynamical_sytems_Recent_advances","265332713_Quasiconformal_Homeomorphisms_and_Dynamics_I_Solution_of_the_Fatou-Julia_Problem_on_Wandering_Domains","249753790_Simultaneous_Diophantine_approximation_and_VIP_systems","248117602_Topological_theory_of_dynamical_systems","245987808_Dynamics_in_One_Complex_Variable","225143056_On_the_pseudo_orbit_tracing_property_and_its_relationship_to_stability","222411104_Multiplicative_structures_in_additively_large_sets","44725945_Equilibrium_states_and_the_ergodic_theory_of_anosov_diffeomorphisms_Rufus_Bowen","44725193_Equilibrium_States_and_the_Ergodic_Theory_of_Anosov_Diffeomorphism","2114454_Chapter_10_On_the_interplay_between_measurable_and_topological_dynamics","1734907_Chain_recurrence_rates_and_topological_entropy"]}
