{"id":"13681980_Medical_informatics--an_interdisciplinary_approach","abstract":"Medical informatics is the first science that has incorporated all traditional medical disciplines. That progress is possible due to fast development of new technologies, particularly in informatics, as well as due to common needs of all medical disciplines. Information is crucial component of all investigations, and that is why the main goal should be incorporation of information technologies into medical practice. Due to its complexity, medical informatics is interdisciplinary. That is evident through incorporation of different methods, principles, techniques etc., that are used while carrying out the tasks in the field of medical informatics. Implementation of modern technologies, particularly information technologies in medicine, will enable faster data processing; it will reduce expenditures in all branches of medicine (statistics, documentation or documentary etc.). Thus, medical staff will have much more time to devote themselves to primary tasks.","authors":["Jana Zvárová","Izet Masic"],"meta":["February 1996Medical Archives 50(3-4):107-9","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
