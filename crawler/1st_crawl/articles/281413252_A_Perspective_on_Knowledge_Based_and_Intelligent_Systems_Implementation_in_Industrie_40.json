{"id":"281413252_A_Perspective_on_Knowledge_Based_and_Intelligent_Systems_Implementation_in_Industrie_40","abstract":"A worldwide trend in advanced manufacturing countries is defining Industrie 4.0, Industrial Internet and Factories of the Future as a new wave that can revolutionize the production and its associated services. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are central to this vision and are entitled to be part of smart machines, storage systems and production facilities able to exchange information with autonomy and intelligence. Such systems should be able to decide and trigger actions, and control each other independently and for such reason it is required the use of Knowledge based and intelligent information approaches. In this paper we present our perspective on how to support Industrie 4.0 with Knowledge based and intelligent systems. We focus in the conceptual model, architecture and necessary elements we believe are required for a real world implementation. We base our conceptualization in the experiences gathered during the participation in different ongoing research projects where the presented architecture is being implemented.","authors":["Carlos Toro","IÃ±igo Barandiaran","Jorge Posada"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 60(1):362-370","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.143"],"references":["263285662_Industrie_40_Hit_or_Hype_Industry_Forum","262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","313575536_Rete_A_fast_algorithm_for_the_many_patternmany_object_pattern_match_problem","286282509_Introduction_to_the_semantic_web_Spinning_the_Semantic_Web","286281317_Decisional_DNA_Based_Framework_for_Representing_Virtual_Engineering_Objects","262312996_Current_research_advances_and_implementations_in_smart_knowledge-based_systems_Part_i","254295040_Building_Domain_Ontologies_from_Engineering_Standards","243775565_L_Rete_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_the_Many_Pattern_Many_Object_Pattern_Match_Problem_Artificial_Intelligence_19","235638230_Decisional_DNA_A_multi-technology_shareable_knowledge_structure_for_decisional_experience","222465509_RETE_A_fast_algorithm_for_the_many_patternmany_object_pattern_match_problem"]}
