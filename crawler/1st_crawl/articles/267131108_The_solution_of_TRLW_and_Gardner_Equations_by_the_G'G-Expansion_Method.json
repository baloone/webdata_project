The proposed method is direct, concise, elementary, and can be used for many other nonlinear evolution equations.","authors":["Nasir Taghizadeh","Ahmad Neirameh"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["243258820_Complex_hyperbolic-function_method_and_its_applications_to_nonlinear_equations","241497025_A_class_of_exact_periodic_solutions_of_nonlinear_envelope_equations","234471698_The_fracG'_G-expansion_method_and_travelling_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations_in_mathematical_physics","243332335_Extended_Jacobi_elliptic_function_rational_expansion_method_and_abundant_families_of_Jacobi_elliptic_function_solutions_to_1_1-dimensional_dispersive_long_wave_equation","243259180_A_generalized_G_'_G_-expansion_method_and_its_applications","230985791_Spectral_transform_for_a_two_spatial_dimension_extension_of_the_dispersive_long_wave_quation","230981260_Multiple_traveling_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations_using_a_unified_algebraic_method","226547847_Solitons_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations_and_the_inverse_scattering_transform","223333883_A_generalized_G'G-expansion_Method_for_the_mKdV_equation_with_variable_coefficients","223111350_The_extended_tanh_method_and_its_applications_for_solving_nonlinear_physical_models","222272423_Application_of_the_G_'G-expansion_method_for_nonlinear_evolution_equations","222978844_Extended_tanh-method_and_its_applications_to_nonlinear_equations"]}
