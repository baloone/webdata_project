{"id":"317775491_Self-Tuning_PID_Control_A_Multivariable_Derivation_and_Application","abstract":"In this paper, a multivariable self-tuning controller with a proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) structure is derived. The algorithm features a combination of the self-tuning properly in which the controller parameters are tuned automatically on-line and also the structure of a multivariable PID controller, making it more favourable to be used in the industries. The algorithm is applied to a microcomputer based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) furnace. Some experiments were conducted to observe the ability of the controller in the temperature control of MIMO furnace under set-point changes and its relative robustness as compared with a fixed tuned multivariable PID (FTMPID) controller. The experimental results prove that the controller is capable of giving a good control result for the process.","authors":["Rubiyah Yusof","S. Omatu","M.
