{"id":"342046668_Putting_PjBL_to_the_Test_The_Impact_of_Project-Based_Learning_on_Second_Graders'_Social_Studies_and_Literacy_Learning_and_Motivation_in_Low-SES_School_Settings","abstract":"This cluster randomized controlled trial investigated the impact of project-based learning with professional development supports on social studies and literacy achievement and motivation of second-grade students from lowâ€“socioeconomic status school districts. At random in within-school pairs, 48 teachers were assigned to the experimental or comparison group. Experimental group teachers were asked to teach four project-based learning units designed to address nearly all social studies and some literacy standards. Comparison group teachers were asked to teach social studies as they normally would except to teach a target number of lessons. The experimental group showed higher growth in social studies and informational reading but not writing or motivation. Greater consistency with project-based learning session plans was associated with higher growth in writing, motivation, and reading.","authors":["Nell K. Duke","Anne-Lise Halvorsen","Stephanie L.
