{"id":"287249961_Applying_Grover's_algorithm_to_AES_quantum_resource_estimates","abstract":"We present quantum circuits to implement an exhaustive key search for the\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES) and analyze the quantum resources required\nto carry out such an attack. We consider the overall circuit size, the number\nof qubits, and the circuit depth as measures for the cost of the presented\nquantum algorithms. Throughout, we focus on Clifford$+T$ gates as the\nunderlying fault-tolerant logical quantum gate set. In particular, for all\nthree variants of AES (key size 128, 192, and 256 bit) that are standardized in\nFIPS-PUB 197, we establish precise bounds for the number of qubits and the\nnumber of elementary logical quantum gates that are needed to implement\nGrover's quantum algorithm to extract the key from a small number of AES\nplaintext-ciphertext pairs.","authors":["Markus Grassl","Brandon Langenberg","Martin Roetteler","Rainer Steinwandt"],"meta":["December 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276458203_Quantum_circuits_for_mathbb_F_2n_F_2_n_-multiplication_with_subquadratic_gate_count","269180686_Fixed-Point_Quantum_Search_with_an_Optimal_Number_of_Queries","262974631_Quantum_arithmetic_and_numerical_analysis_using_Repeat-Until-Success_circuits","319523609_Tight_Bounds_on_Quantum_Searching","280969915_On_the_advantages_of_using_relative_phase_Toffolis_with_an_application_to_multiple_control_Toffoli_optimization","266511370_Strict_key_avalanche_criterion","265424388_Cryptography_A_primer","237082797_A_note_on_quantum_related-key_attacks","235892141_Polynomial-Time_T-Depth_Optimization_of_CliffordT_Circuits_Via_Matroid_Partitioning","233947256_Novel_constructions_for_the_fault-tolerant_Toffoli_gate"]}
