{"id":"256392435_Counting_and_constructing_orthogonal_circulants","abstract":"If F is an arbitrary finite field and T is an n × n orthogonal matrix with entries in F then one may ask how to find all the orthogonal matrices belonging to the algebra F[T] and one may want to know the cardinality of this group. We present here a means of constructing this group of orthogonal matrices given the complete factorization of the minimal polynomial of T over F. As a corollary of this construction scheme we give an explicit formula for the number of n × n orthogonal circulant matrices over GF(pl) and a similar formula for symmetric circulants. These generalize results of MacWilliams, J.
