{"id":"284788346_Using_tropical_optimization_to_solve_constrained_minimax_single-facility_location_problems_with_rectilinear_distance","abstract":"We consider a constrained minimax single-facility location problem with\naddends on the plane with rectilinear distance. The problem is first formulated\nin a standard form, and then represented in terms of tropical mathematics as a\nconstrained optimization problem. We apply methods and results of tropical\noptimization to obtain direct, explicit solutions to the optimization problem.\nThe results obtained are used to derive solutions of the location problem, and\nof its special cases with reduced sets of constraints, in a closed form, ready\nfor immediate computation. Numerical solutions of example problems are given,\nand graphical illustrations are presented.","authors":["Nikolai Krivulin"],"meta":["October 2017Computational Management Science 14(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10287-017-0289-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["303595828_Direct_solution_to_constrained_tropical_optimization_problems_with_application_to_project_scheduling","346012951_Logistics_of_Facility_Location_and_Allocation","345743906_Tropical_Algebraic_Geometry","321621306_Facility_Location_Concepts_Models_Algorithms_and_Case_Studies","321610821_Foundations_of_Location_Analysis","321600090_Max-Plus_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Control_and_Estimation","314638490_Facility_Location","307817428_Approximate_Techniques_in_Solving_Optimal_Camera_Placement_Problems","303507686_Recent_Advances_in_Camera_Planning_for_Large_Area_Surveillance_A_Comprehensive_Review","284404621_A_note_on_a_minimax_location_problem"]}
