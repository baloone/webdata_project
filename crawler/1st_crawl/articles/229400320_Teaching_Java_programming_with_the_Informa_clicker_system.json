{"id":"229400320_Teaching_Java_programming_with_the_Informa_clicker_system","abstract":"This paper describes the use of clickers in a Java programming course. However, instead of using ordinary hardware clickers, we use software clickers, implemented in Java, that allow for much richer problem types than the traditional multiple-choice question. The problem types we introduce in this paper give students a much higher degree of freedom in solving a problem, and thus more opportunities for making mistakes. We look at mistakes as learning opportunities, and we introduce a pedagogical approach that allows students to learn from mistakes of their peers. We finish with a case study and an evaluation of our approach based on the detailed analysis of its use in two semesters of an undergraduate Java programming course.Highlights► Informa is a clicker solution that supports teaching Java programming. ► Informa does not require hardware clickers. ► It provides a rich set of problem types beyond simple multiple-choice questions. ► Our pedagogical approach allows students to learn from mistakes of their peers. ► We found that Informa significantly improved our teaching.","authors":["Matthias Hauswirth","Andrea Adamoli"],"meta":["January 2011Science of Computer Programming 78(5):-","DOI:10.1016/j.scico.2011.06.006"],"references":["251285609_Development_of_a_Tablet-PC-based_System_to_Increase_Instructor-Student_Classroom_Interactions_and_Student_Learning","242352534_FIVE_KEY_CONSIDERATIONS_FOR_NETWORKING_IN_A_HANDHELD-BASED_MATHEMATICS_CLASSROOM","234827762_Improving_Learning_in_CS1_with_Tablet-PC-based_In-Class_Assessment","228637370_The_Learning_Environment_in_Clicker_Classrooms_Student_Processes_of_Learning_and_Involvement_in_Large_University-Level_Courses_using_Student_Response_Systems","225382324_Classroom_Response_Systems_A_Review_of_the_Literature","32231562_Over-scripting_CSCL_The_risks_of_blending_collaborative_learning_with_instructional_design","4345163_CoFFEE_Cooperative_Face2Face_educational_environment","2555329_The_Conversational_Classroom","2386182_The_BlueJ_System_and_its_Pedagogy","277289240_Electronically_enhanced_classroom_interaction","275635717_Why_Many_College_Teachers_Cannot_Lecture_How_to_Avoid_Communication_Breakdown_in_the_Classroom","253295534_An_Overview_of_Teaching_and_Learning_Research_with_Classroom_Communication_Systems_CCSs","249778349_Classroom_Response_and_Communication_Systems_Research_Review_and_Theory","242354560_Objects_first_with_java_a_practical_introduction_using_bluej","238374411_What's_the_Use_of_Lectures","228981718_Things_are_clicking_in_CS4","221391887_Informa_An_Extensible_Framework_for_Group_Response_Systems","221391556_Designing_Collaborative_Environments_and_their_Application_in_Learning","201381679_What's_the_Use_of_Lectures"]}
