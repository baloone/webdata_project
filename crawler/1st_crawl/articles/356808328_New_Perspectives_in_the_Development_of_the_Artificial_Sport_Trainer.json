{"id":"356808328_New_Perspectives_in_the_Development_of_the_Artificial_Sport_Trainer","abstract":"The rapid development of computer science and telecommunications has brought new ways and practices to sport training. The artificial sport trainer, founded on computational intelligence algorithms, has gained momentum in the last years. However, artificial sport trainer usually suffers from a lack of automatisation in realization and control phases of the training. In this study, the Digital Twin is proposed as a framework for helping athletes, during realization of training sessions, to make the proper decisions in situations they encounter. The digital twin for artificial sport trainer is based on the cognitive model of humans. This concept has been applied to cycling, where a version of the system on a Raspberry Pi already exists. The results of porting the digital twin on the mentioned platform shows promising potential for its extension to other sport disciplines.","authors":["Iztok Fister jr.","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","Andrés Iglesias","Dušan Fister"],"meta":["December 2021Applied Sciences 11(23):11452","DOI:10.3390/app112311452"],"references":["355780009_Artificial_Intelligence_Based_Body_Sensor_Network_Framework-Narrative_Review_Proposing_an_End-to-End_Framework_using_Wearable_Sensors_Real-Time_Location_Systems_and_Artificial_IntelligenceMachine_Lear","354551773_Indirect_Structural_Muscle_Injuries_of_Lower_Limb_Rehabilitation_and_Therapeutic_Exercise","351826871_Information_Cartography_in_Association_Rule_Mining","348882695_Application_of_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_to_Automate_the_Measurement_of_Kinematic_Characteristics_of_Punches_in_Boxing","348035388_Towards_an_AI-Based_Tailored_Training_Planning_for_Road_Cyclists_A_Case_Study","346650038_Effect_of_Video_Observation_and_Motor_Imagery_on_Simple_Reaction_Time_in_Cadet_Pilots","344215994_Tendinopathies_of_the_hip_and_pelvis_in_athletes_A_narrative_review","342923269_External_Responsiveness_of_the_SuperOp_TM_Device_to_Assess_Recovery_After_Exercise_A_Pilot_Study","351697310_LSTM_with_bio_inspired_algorithm_for_action_recognition_in_sports_videos","348820890_Application_of_Internet_of_Things_and_artificial_intelligence_for_smart_fitness_A_survey"]}
