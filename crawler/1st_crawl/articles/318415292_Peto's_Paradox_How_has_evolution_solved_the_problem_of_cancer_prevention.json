{"id":"318415292_Peto's_Paradox_How_has_evolution_solved_the_problem_of_cancer_prevention","abstract":"The risk of developing cancer should theoretically increase with both the number of cells and the lifespan of an organism. However, gigantic animals do not get more cancer than humans, suggesting that super-human cancer suppression has evolved numerous times across the tree of life. This is the essence and promise of Peto’s Paradox. We discuss what is known about Peto’s Paradox and provide hints of what is yet to be discovered.","authors":["Marc Tollis","Amy M Boddy","Carlo Maley"],"meta":["December 2017BMC Biology 15(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12915-017-0401-7"],"references":["299243824_Individual-level_selection_as_a_cause_of_Cope's_rule_of_phyletic_size_increase","282760802_Potential_Mechanisms_for_Cancer_Resistance_in_Elephants_and_Comparative_Cellular_Response_to_DNA_Damage_in_Humans","282348444_Maiasaura_a_model_organism_for_extinct_vertebrate_population_biology_A_large_sample_statistical_assessment_of_growth_dynamics_and_survivorship","278046694_Inclusive_fitness_effects_can_select_for_cancer_suppression_into_old_age","278046498_Solutions_to_Peto's_paradox_revealed_by_mathematical_modelling_and_cross-species_cancer_gene_analysis","277874145_Cancer_susceptibility_and_reproductive_trade-offs_A_model_of_the_evolution_of_cancer_defences","322055379_Correction_TP53_copy_number_expansion_is_associated_with_the_evolution_of_increased_body_size_and_an_enhanced_DNA_damage_response_in_elephants","316663451_Life_history_immunity_Peto's_paradox_and_tumors_in_birds","294422857_Multiple_neoplasms_in_a_single_sauropod_dinosaur_from_the_Upper_Cretaceous_of_Brazil","285001424_Epidemiology_multistage_models_and_short-term_mutagenicity_tests"]}
