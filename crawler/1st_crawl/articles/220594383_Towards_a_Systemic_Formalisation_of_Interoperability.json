{"id":"220594383_Towards_a_Systemic_Formalisation_of_Interoperability","abstract":"Interoperability has been mainly approached from an IT point of view or enterprise collaboration perspective. This paper aims at contributing to develop a science base for interoperability by studying interoperability on the basis of the system theory. The main contribution is to propose a formalisation of interoperability grounded in the general system theory: the Ontology of Interoperability (OoI). OoI provides a meta-model for ontological descriptions of systems, problems and solutions, which can then be inferred for a computer-aided interoperability diagnosis and problem solving. Related concepts definitions as well as a systemic model and a decisional model are given and discussed. Based on the Framework for Enterprise Interoperability (CEN/ISO 11354), the specialisation of the OoI to the enterprise domain is discussed. A case example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.","authors":["Yannick Naudet","Thibaud Latour","Wided Gu√©dria","David Chen"],"meta":["February 2010Computers in Industry 61(2):176-185","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2009.10.014","SourceDBLP"],"references":["324366344_La_theorie_du_systeme_general_Theorie_de_la_modelisation","237132093_System_of_Systems_Interoperability_SOSI_Final_Report","221443704_An_Ontology_of_Interoperability_in_Inter-Enterprise_Communities","220921500_Enterprise_Interoperability_Framework","220921265_A_Model-based_Ontology_of_the_Software_Interoperability_Problem_Preliminary_Results","220921207_A_Model_Proposal_of_the_Interoperability_Problem","220920998_Describing_Interoperability_the_OoI_Ontology","313644269_Framework_for_enterprise_interoperability","272829850_RDF_Vocabulary_Description_Language_10_RDF_Schema_W3C_Recommendation_10_February_2004","267163847_A_Systemic_approach_to_Interoperability_formalization","266833888_Treatise_on_basic_philosophy_Vol_4_Ontology_II_A_world_of_systems","242500844_Treatise_on_basic_philosophy_ontology_i_the_furniture_of_the_worm","227670343_Framework_for_Enterprise_Interoperability","225691340_Fabrication_and_characterization_of_DRIE-micromachined_electrostatic_microactuators_for_hard_disk_drives","220999852_Enterprise_ontology_in_enterprise_engineering","200025939_General_System_Theory_Foundations_Development_Applications"]}
