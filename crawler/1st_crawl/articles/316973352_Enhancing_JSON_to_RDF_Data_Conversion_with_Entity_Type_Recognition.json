{"id":"316973352_Enhancing_JSON_to_RDF_Data_Conversion_with_Entity_Type_Recognition","abstract":"Nowadays, many Web data sources and APIs make their data available on the Web in semi-structured formats such as JSON. However, JSON data cannot be directly used in the Web of data, where principles such as URIs and semantically named links are essential. Thus it is necessary to convert JSON data into RDF data. To this end, we have to consider semantics in order to provide data reference according to domain vocabularies. To help matters, we present an approach which identifies JSON metadata, aligns them with domain vocabulary terms and converts data into RDF. In addition, along with the data conversion process, we provide the identification of the semantically most appropriate entity types to the JSON objects. We present the definitions underlying our approach and results obtained with the evaluation.","authors":["Damires Souza","Fellipe Freire","Crishane Freire"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.5220/0006302900970106","Conference: 13th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST 2017)At: Porto, Portugal"],"references":["278717385_TRank_Ranking_Entity_Types_Using_the_Web_of_Data","268195858_A_Scalable_Approach_to_Learn_Semantic_Models_of_Structured_Sources","262172279_A_Domain-based_Approach_to_Publish_Data_on_the_Web","234126805_Mining_Linked_Open_Data_through_Semi-supervised_Learning_Methods_Based_on_Self-Training","299680686_High-Level_Rules_for_Integration_and_Analysis_of_Data_New_Challenges","282069303_Entity_Type_Recognition_for_Heterogeneous_Semantic_Graphs","220575541_The_alignment_API_40","220434124_Information_Calculus_for_Information_Retrieval","215500471_Linked_Data_Evolving_the_Web_into_a_Global_Data_Space"]}
