{"id":"215506184_Physically_Based_Rendering_From_Theory_To_Implementation","abstract":"Physically Based Rendering, 2nd Edition describes both the mathematical theory behind a modern photorealistic rendering system as well as its practical implementation. A method - known as 'literate programming'- combines human-readable documentation and source code into a single reference that is specifically designed to aid comprehension. The result is a stunning achievement in graphics education. Through the ideas and software in this book, you will learn to design and employ a full-featured rendering system for creating stunning imagery.","authors":["Matt Pharr","Greg Humphreys"],"meta":["August 2004","Publisher: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc."],"references":["258169040_The_Monte_Carlo_method_in_lighting_calculations","234830872_Synthetic_texturing_using_digital_filters","234810471_Modeling_and_rendering_of_quasi-homogeneous_materials","234793986_Towards_Image_Realism_with_Interactive_Update_Rates_in_Complex_Virtual_Building_Environments''","234777691_Ray_tracing_deterministic_3-D_fractals","221401597_Quantitative_Comparison_of_Sinc-Approximating_Kernels_for_Medical_Image_Interpolation","220852950_Interactive_Distributed_Ray_Tracing_of_Highly_Complex_Models","220852928_Importance_Resampling_for_Global_Illumination","220721861_Adaptive_Radiosity_Textures_for_Bidirectional_Ray_Tracing","220721859_Fake_fur_rendering","220721753_Particle_Transport_and_Image_Synthesis","295152637_SHADING_MODEL_FOR_ATMOSPHERIC_SCATTERING_CONSIDERING_LUMINOUS_INTENSITY_DISTRIBUTION_OF_LIGHT_SOURCES","291182062_Quaternions_and_4_4_matrices","291181684_Classifying_small_sparse_matrices","291181509_A_recursive_shadow_voxel_cache_for_ray_tracing","284866325_Real_pixels","269197810_Transparency_for_computer_synthesized_images","262247775_Some_regularization_problems_in_ray_tracing","262215666_Euler_Angle_Conversion","262175020_Forms_Vectors_And_Transforms","255677117_Perceptual_Color_Spaces_for_Computer_Graphics","247284059_Properties_Of_Surface-Normal_Transformations","247160641_Relationship_between_radiative-transport_theory_and_Maxwell's_equations_in_dielectric_media","243679171_On_the_Scattering_and_Absorption_of_Light_in_Gaseous_Media_with_Applications_to_the_Intensity_of_Sky_Radiation","243067794_The_solution_of_an_integral_equation_occurring_in_the_theory_of_radiation","239666163_Improving_Computational_Methods_for_Ray_Tracing","239061142_Ray_Tracing_and_Irregularities_of_Distribution","236567363_Algorithms_for_Forcing_Scattered_Radiation_to_Spherical_Planar_Circular_and_Right_Circular_Cylindrical_Detectors_for_Monte_Carlo_Simulation","236402297_Monte_Carlo_learningbiasing_experiment_with_intelligent_random_numbers","234831231_Lighting_controls_for_synthetic_images","234815118_Guaranteed_ray_intersections_with_implicit_surfaces","234803074_Clamping_A_method_of_antialiasing_textured_surfaces_by_bandwidth_limiting_in_object_space","234797316_Simulation_of_natural_scenes_using_textured_quadric_surfaces","234794214_Interactive_subsurface_scattering_for_translucent_meshes","234794066_3D_graphics_and_the_wave_theory","234791890_Adjoint_equations_and_random_walks_for_illumination_computation","234789701_Ray_tracing_algebraic_surfaces","234774646_Texture_tile_considerations_for_raster_graphics","234171744_On_the_equilibrium_of_the_Sun's_atmosphere","229701776_Inverse_Displacement_Mapping_in_the_General_Case","228551630_Faster_Photon_Map_Global_Illumination","227719228_Inverse_Displacement_Mapping","227700577_Balancing_Considered_Harmful_-_Faster_Photon_Mapping_using_the_Voxel_Volume_Heuristic_-","227652870_Ray_Differentials_and_Multiresolution_Geometry_Caching_for_Distribution_Ray_Tracing_in_Complex_Scenes","225685215_Worst-Case_Versus_Average_Case_Complexity_of_Ray-Shooting","222551343_Using_low-discrepancy_sequences_and_the_Crofton_formula_to_compute_surface_areas_of_geometric_models","222436940_Similarity_relations_for_anisotropic_scattering_in_Monte_Carlo_simulations_of_deeply_penetrating_neutral_particles","220853097_Local_Illumination_Environments_for_Direct_Lighting_Acceleration","220852852_Time_Dependent_Photon_Mapping","220792098_Matrix_radiance_transfer","220721577_Continuous_tone_representation_of_three-dimensional_objects_illuminated_by_sky_light","220721478_Ray_tracing_Jell-O_brand_gelatin","220721725_A_frequency_based_ray_tracer","220721494_Atmospheric_illumination_and_shadows","220721472_Bidirectional_reflection_functions_from_surface_bump_maps"]}
