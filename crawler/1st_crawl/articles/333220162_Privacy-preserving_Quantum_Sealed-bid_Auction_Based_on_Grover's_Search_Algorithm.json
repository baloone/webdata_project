{"id":"333220162_Privacy-preserving_Quantum_Sealed-bid_Auction_Based_on_Grover's_Search_Algorithm","abstract":"Sealed-bid auction is an important tool in modern economic especially concerned with networks. However, the bidders still lack the privacy protection in previously proposed sealed-bid auction schemes. In this paper, we focus on how to further protect the privacy of the bidders, especially the non-winning bidders. We first give a new privacy-preserving model of sealed-bid auction and then present a quantum sealed-bid auction scheme with stronger privacy protection. Our proposed scheme takes a general state in N-dimensional Hilbert space as the message carrier, in which each bidder privately marks his bid in an anonymous way, and further utilizes Groverâ€™s search algorithm to find the current highest bid. By O(lnn) iterations, it can get the highest bid finally. Compared with any classical scheme in theory, our proposed quantum scheme gets the lower communication complexity.","authors":["Run-hua Shi","Mingwu Zhang"],"meta":["May 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-44030-8"],"references":["322261532_An_economic_and_feasible_Quantum_Sealed-bid_Auction_protocol","318194705_A_Third-Party_E-Payment_Protocol_Based_on_Quantum_Group_Blind_Signature","315713168_Complete_3-Qubit_Grover_Search_on_a_Programmable_Quantum_Computer","312062995_The_postprocessing_of_quantum_digital_signatures","311223054_Private_quantum_computation_An_introduction_to_blind_quantum_computing_and_related_protocols","329229645_Blind_quantum_computation_with_a_noise_channel","326503184_Three-step_three-party_quantum_secure_direct_communication","318671293_Experimental_Realization_of_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Summation_Using_Five-Qubit_IBM_Quantum_Computer_on_Cloud","317941604_Distributed_secure_quantum_machine_learning","312252597_Comment_on_Secure_quantum_private_information_retrieval_using_phase-encoded_queries"]}
