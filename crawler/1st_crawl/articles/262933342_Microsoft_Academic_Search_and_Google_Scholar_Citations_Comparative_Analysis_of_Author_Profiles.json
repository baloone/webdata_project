{"id":"262933342_Microsoft_Academic_Search_and_Google_Scholar_Citations_Comparative_Analysis_of_Author_Profiles","abstract":"This paper aims to make a comparative analysis between the personal profiling capabilities of the two most important free citation-based academic search engines, namely Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) and Google Scholar Citations (GSC). Author profiles can be very useful for evaluation purposes once the advantages and the shortcomings of these services are described and taken into consideration. A total of 771 personal profiles appearing in both the MAS and the GSC databases are analysed. Results show that the GSC profiles include more documents and citations than those in MAS, but with a strong bias towards the Information and Computing sciences, while the MAS profiles are disciplinarily better balanced. MAS shows technical problems such as a higher number of duplicated profiles and a lower updating rate than GSC. It is concluded that both services could be used for evaluation proposes only if they are applied along with other citation indexes as a way to supplement that information.","authors":["Jose Luis Ortega","Isidro F.
