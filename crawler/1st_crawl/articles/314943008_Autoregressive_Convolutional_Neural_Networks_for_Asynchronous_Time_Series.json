{"id":"314943008_Autoregressive_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Asynchronous_Time_Series","abstract":"We propose 'Significance-Offset Convolutional Neural Network', a deep convolutional network architecture for multivariate time series regression. The model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and gating mechanisms used in recurrent neural networks. It involves an AR-like weighting system, where the final predictor is obtained as a weighted sum of sub-predictors while the weights are data-dependent functions learnt through a convolutional network.The architecture was designed for applications on asynchronous time series with low signal-to-noise ratio and hence is evaluated on such datasets: a hedge fund proprietary dataset of over2 million quotes for a credit derivative index andan artificially generated noisy autoregressive series. The proposed architecture achieves promising results compared to convolutional and recur-rent neural networks. The code for the numerical experiments and the architecture implementation will be shared online to make the research reproducible.","authors":["Mikołaj Bińkowski","Gautier Marti","Philippe Donnat"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: Credit Default Swaps Market Microstructure"],"references":["313727065_Empirical_properties_of_asset_returns_Stylized_facts_and_statistical_issues","311900760_Language_Modeling_with_Gated_Convolutional_Networks","309460603_Cleaning_large_correlation_matrices_Tools_from_Random_Matrix_Theory","308109831_Efficient_softmax_approximation_for_GPUs","303879869_MuFuRU_The_Multi-Function_Recurrent_Unit","312170098_Deep_Learning_for_Time-Series_Analysis","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","303970230_A_scalable_end-to-end_Gaussian_process_adapter_for_irregularly_sampled_time_series_classification","301847993_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Language_Modeling","288352112_American_Economic_Review"]}
