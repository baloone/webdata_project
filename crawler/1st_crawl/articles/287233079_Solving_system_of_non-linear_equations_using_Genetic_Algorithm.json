{"id":"287233079_Solving_system_of_non-linear_equations_using_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"Solving system of non-linear equation is a general purpose problem that can be applied to real-time applications. Although there are several methods like Newton-Raphson method, secant method, bisection method, fixed-point iteration etc. evolutionary and soft computing methods optimize the space and time complexity to solve nonlinear systems. In this article, we present the Genetic Algorithm approach to solve nonlinear system of equations for travelling salesman problem, tank reactor system and neurophysiology application. The roots of nonlinear system using GA is estimated using population size, degree of mutation, crossover rate and coefficient size. Nonlinear parameters are analyzed and simulated for multi-dimensional NP hard travelling salesman problem, two dimensional tank reactor and neurophysiology application.","authors":["Gopesh Joshi","M.
