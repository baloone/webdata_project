{"id":"327623745_Higher_Order_Vagueness","abstract":"A discussion on this so debatable and debated concept, Higher Order Vagueness. After going through the issues that make Higher Order Vagueness an object of scientific attention, we conclude that vagueness is undesirable in logical systems but desirable in language, and the Semiotics Universe splits into three other universes inside of the universe of the Computer Science Systems. We create a new way of addressing problems with sigmatoids, and define vagueness in an almost mathematical fashion.","authors":["Marcia Ricci Pinheiro"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.5923/j.ap.20180202.02","Project: Nonclassical Systems"],"references":["318038905_Human_Persona","308968450_Possible_Worlds_x_Psychiatry","308356437_The_Intrinsic_Vagueness_of_Being","287206279_Words_for_Science","238410784_Why_Higher-Order_Vagueness_is_a_Pseudo-Problem"]}
