Quick and easy access to this information leads some students to copy and paste. To prevent plagiarism, a series of seven workshops on digital scrapbooking strategies wasoffered to 63 high school students. Participants completed questionnaires and participatedin interviews. The results show that scrapbooking strategies are unfamiliar to high schoolstudents. Students would benefit from being taught these strategies in order to developbetter writing habits and learn how to write without plagiarizing.","authors":["M.
