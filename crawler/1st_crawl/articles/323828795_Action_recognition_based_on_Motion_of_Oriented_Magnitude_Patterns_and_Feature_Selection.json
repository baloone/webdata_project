{"id":"323828795_Action_recognition_based_on_Motion_of_Oriented_Magnitude_Patterns_and_Feature_Selection","abstract":"Here, the authors introduce a novel system which incorporates the discriminative motion of oriented magnitude patterns (MOMP) descriptor into simple yet efficient techniques. The authors' descriptor both investigates the relations of the local gradient distributions in neighbours among consecutive image sequences and characterises information changing across different orientations. The proposed system has two main contributions: (i) the authors adopt feature post-processing principal component analysis followed by vector of locally aggregated descriptors encoding to de-correlate MOMP descriptor and reduce the dimension in order to speed up the algorithm; (ii) then the authors include the feature selection (i.e. statistical dependency, mutual information, and minimal redundancy maximal relevance) to find out the best feature subset to improve the performance and decrease the computational expense in classification through support vector machine techniques. Experiment results on four data sets, Weizmann (98.4%), KTH (96.3%), UCF Sport (82.0%), and HMDB51 (31.5%), prove the efficiency of the authors' algorithm.","authors":["Hai-Hong Phan","Son Vu","Vu-lam Nguyen","Mathias Quoy"],"meta":["March 2018IET Computer Vision 12(5)","DOI:10.1049/iet-cvi.2017.0282"],"references":["308034527_Long-term_recurrent_convolutional_networks_for_visual_recognition_and_description","301877415_Long-Term_Temporal_Convolutions_for_Action_Recognition","270906542_Combining_Language_and_Vision_with_a_Multimodal_Skip-gram_Model","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","262974373_Log-Euclidean_Bag_of_Words_for_Human_Action_Recognition","262209066_Spatio-temporal_SIFT_and_Its_Application_to_Human_Action_Classification","257672334_Dense_Trajectories_and_Motion_Boundary_Descriptors_for_Action_Recognition","233815759_UCF101_A_Dataset_of_101_Human_Actions_Classes_From_Videos_in_The_Wild","230668339_Action_Bank_A_High-Level_Representation_of_Activity_in_Video","224164326_Aggregating_local_descriptors_into_a_compact_image_representation","221364166_A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Shape_and_Appearance_for_Human_Action_Classification","326574696_Asymmetric_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Action_Recognition","322647197_Darwintrees_for_Action_Recognition","320968190_ActionVLAD_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Aggregation_for_Action_Classification","320968042_Spatiotemporal_Multiplier_Networks_for_Video_Action_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","315882270_ActionVLAD_Learning_spatio-temporal_aggregation_for_action_classification","312621023_Filters_Wrappers_and_a_boosting-based_hybrid_for_feature_selection","311610155_Convolutional_Two-Stream_Network_Fusion_for_Video_Action_Recognition","311609274_A_Key_Volume_Mining_Deep_Framework_for_Action_Recognition","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311532116_Motion_of_Oriented_Magnitudes_Patterns_for_Human_Action_Recognition","311344466_Learning_spatiotemporal_features_with_3d_convolutional_networks","310842565_Action_MACH_A_spatio-temporal_maximum_average_correlation_height_filter_for_action_recognition","308277657_Shuffle_and_Learn_Unsupervised_Learning_Using_Temporal_Order_Verification","300408292_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_with_3D_Convolutional_Networks","299487275_Dynamic_Image_Networks_for_Action_Recognition","295246497_Continuous_action_segmentation_and_recognition_using_hybrid_convolutional_neural_network-hidden_Markov_model_model","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","279258310_Efficient_Feature_Extraction_Encoding_and_Classification_for_Action_Recognition","272520999_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_Representations_for_Action_Recognition_A_Genetic_Programming_Approach","268268215_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","267556576_Learning_human_actions_in_video","264937050_Discriminant_Bag_of_Words_based_representation_for_human_action_recognition","262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos","262320131_Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories","262312052_Atomic_Action_Features_A_New_Feature_for_Action_Recognition","262288166_Multiple_scale-specific_representations_for_improved_human_action_recognition","257559487_Recognising_Human_Actions_by_Analyzing_Negative_Spaces","226678977_On_Space-Time_Interest_Points","224254831_Appendix_Learning_Hierarchical_Invariant_Spatio-Temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition_with_Independent_Subspace_Analysis","224135942_Local_Trinary_Patterns_for_Human_Action_Recognition","224135326_Human_action_recognition_from_a_single_clip_per_action","221573131_A_3-dimensional_SIFT_descriptor_and_its_application_to_action_recognition","221364540_Learning_a_hierarchy_of_discriminative_space-time_neighborhood_features_for_human_action_recognition","221364410_Action_recognition_with_multiscale_spatio-temporal_contexts","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221361669_Recognizing_Human_Activities_from_Silhouettes_Motion_Subspace_and_Factorial_Discriminative_Graphical_Model","221346417_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Action_Recognition","221304550_Human_Detection_Using_Oriented_Histograms_of_Flow_and_Appearance","221159294_Human_Action_Recognition_Using_Distribution_of_Oriented_Rectangular_Patches","221111664_HMDB51_A_Large_Video_Database_for_Human_Motion_Recognition","221304145_Human_Activity_Recognition_with_Metric_Learning","221259643_A_Spatio-Temporal_Descriptor_Based_on_3D-Gradients","221259353_Evaluation_of_Local_Spatio-temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition"]}
