{"id":"342924517_CRISPRL_and_Interpretable_large-scale_inference_of_DNA_repair_landscape_based_on_a_spectral_approach","abstract":"We propose a new spectral framework for reliable training, scalable inference and interpretable explanation of the DNA repair outcome following a Cas9 cutting. Our framework, dubbed CRISPRL and, relies on an unexploited observation about the nature of the repair process: the landscape of the DNA repair is highly sparse in the (Walsh-Hadamard) spectral domain. This observation enables our framework to address key shortcomings that limit the interpretability and scaling of current deep-learning-based DNA repair models. In particular, CRISPRL and reduces the time to compute the full DNA repair landscape from a striking 5230 years to 1 week and the sampling complexity from 1012 to 3 million guide RNAs with only a small loss in accuracy (R2R2 âˆ¼ 0.9). Our proposed framework is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy that uses a fast peeling algorithm to learn the DNA repair models. CRISPRL and captures lower-degree features around the cut site, which enrich for short insertions and deletions as well as higher-degree microhomology patterns that enrich for longer deletions.\n\nAvailability and implementation: \nThe CRISPRL and software is publicly available at https://github.com/UCBASiCS/CRISPRLand.","authors":["Amirali Aghazadeh","Orhan Ocal","Kannan Ramchandran"],"meta":["July 2020Bioinformatics 36(Supplement_1):i560-i568","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa505"],"references":["334750459_Large_dataset_enables_prediction_of_repair_after_CRISPR-Cas9_editing_in_primary_T_cells","329224453_Predicting_the_mutations_generated_by_repair_of_Cas9-induced_double-strand_breaks","328790443_Predictable_and_precise_template-free_CRISPR_editing_of_pathogenic_variants","280496611_Predicting_the_sequence_specificities_of_DNA-_and_RNA-binding_proteins_by_deep_learning","336101576_Low-degree_Pseudo-Boolean_Function_Recovery_Using_Codes","334473481_Machine-learning-guided_directed_evolution_for_protein_engineering","308088452_The_coming_of_age_of_de_novo_protein_design","305920967_DNA_Repair_Profiling_Reveals_Nonrandom_Outcomes_at_Cas9-Mediated_Breaks","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","281312510_SPRIGHT_A_Fast_and_Robust_Framework_for_Sparse_Walsh-Hadamard_Transform"]}
