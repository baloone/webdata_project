{"id":"297047486_Mixing_Computations_and_Proofs","abstract":"We examine the relationship between proof and computation in mathematics, especially in formalized mathematics. We compare the various approaches to proofs with a significant computational component, including (i) verifying the algorithms, (ii) verifying the results of the unverified algorithms, and (iii) trusting an external computation.","authors":["Michael Beeson"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Formalized Reasoning 9(1):71-99","DOI:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/4552","Project: Semantics of computer algebra"],"references":["283428521_Formal_Proofs_of_Hypergeometric_Sums_Dedicated_to_the_memory_of_Andrzej_Trybulec","257285461_A_Machine-Checked_Proof_of_the_Odd_Order_Theorem","324639086_How_to_Write_a_Proof","319393930_Analytica_-_An_Experiment_in_Combining_Theorem_Proving_and_Symbolic_Computation","317219662_Equational_reasoning_via_partial_reflection","284688895_Formal_proof_-_The_four-color_theorem","267937553_HOL_Light_Tutorial_for_version_220","266015179_Formalizing_a_Proof_that_e_is_Transcendental","263904833_USING_NONSTANDARD_ANALYSIS_TO_ENSURE_THE_CORRECTNESS_OF_SYMBOLIC_COMPUTATIONS","257759171_How_to_write_a_21st_century_proof"]}
