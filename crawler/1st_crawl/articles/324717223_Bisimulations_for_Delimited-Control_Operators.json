{"id":"324717223_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators","abstract":"We propose a survey of the behavioral theory of an untyped lambda-calculus extended with the delimited-control operators shift and reset. We define a contextual equivalence for this calculus, that we then aim to characterize with coinductively defined relations, called bisimilarities. We study different styles of bisimilarities (namely applicative, normal-form, and environmental), and we give several examples to illustrate their respective strengths and weaknesses. We also discuss how to extend this work to other delimited-control operators.","authors":["Dariusz Biernacki","Sergue√Ø Lenglet","Piotr Polesiuk"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["276452251_Applicative_Bisimilarities_for_Call-by-Name_and_Call-by-Value_lm-Calculus","311106700_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators_with_Dynamic_Prompt_Generation","310820953_Coinduction_All_the_Way_Up","303968960_A_Bisimulation_for_Type_Abstraction_and_Recursion","289047637_Axiomatizing_subtyped_delimited_continuations","281603089_Higher-order_languages_dualities_and_bisimulation_enhancements","265371850_Enhancements_of_the_bisimulation_proof_method","262273915_Complete_Lattices_and_Up-To_Techniques","261055522_A_Higher-Order_Distributed_Calculus_with_Name_Creation","256606312_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators"]}
