{"id":"262391259_Factors_impacting_student_perceptions_of_computing_and_CIS_majors","abstract":"Students entering university arrive with predefined perceptions about computing, about CIS majors, and about the role of technology in academia and society. Understanding the sociological and experiential factors which influence these perceptions can help CIS faculty devise programs and content more likely to be successful in attracting majors. This paper will discuss a multi-campus study intended to elicit the factors which impact students' perceptions of computing and CIS majors. The results suggest that differences in perceptions persist between genders, and that parental and K-12 efforts to stress computing may be having unintended effects.","authors":["Jeffrey A.
