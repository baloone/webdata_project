{"id":"330428300_Simulating_Dynamic_Quantum_Phase_Transitions_in_Photonic_Quantum_Walks","abstract":"Signaled by nonanalyticities in the time evolution of physical observables, dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) emerge in quench dynamics of topological systems and possess an interesting geometric origin captured by dynamic topological order parameters (DTOPs). In this Letter, we report the experimental study of DQPTs using discrete-time quantum walks of single photons. We simulate quench dynamics between distinct Floquet topological phases using quantum-walk dynamics and experimentally characterize DQPTs and the underlying DTOPs through interference-based measurements. The versatile photonic quantum-walk platform further allows us to experimentally investigate DQPTs for mixed states and in parity-time-symmetric nonunitary dynamics for the first time. Our experiment directly confirms the relation between DQPTs and DTOPs in quench dynamics of topological systems and opens up the avenue of simulating emergent topological phenomena using discrete-time quantum-walk dynamics.","authors":["Kunkun Wang","Qiu Xingze","Lei Xiao","Xiang Zhan"],"meta":["January 2019Physical Review Letters 122(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.020501"],"references":["323746948_Probing_Measurement_Induced_Effects_in_Quantum_Walks_via_Recurrence","321884264_Observation_of_dynamical_vortices_after_quenches_in_a_system_with_topology","321374789_Dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions_in_non-Hermitian_lattices","320070766_Detecting_Topological_Invariants_in_Nonunitary_Discrete-Time_Quantum_Walks","318898913_Observation_of_a_Many-Body_Dynamical_Phase_Transition_with_a_53-Qubit_Quantum_Simulator","318460833_Probing_many-body_dynamics_on_a_51-atom_quantum_simulator","317344428_Observation_of_a_symmetry-protected_topological_phase_with_ultracold_fermions","312470807_Emergent_topology_and_dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions_in_two-dimensional_closed_quantum_systems","309317432_Detection_of_Zak_phases_and_topological_invariants_in_a_chiral_photonic_quantum_walk","308981031_Interconnections_between_equilibrium_topology_and_dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions_a_linearly_ramped_Haldane_model","301597635_Statistical_moments_of_quantum-walk_dynamics_reveal_topological_quantum_transitions","268228000_Experimental_realization_of_the_topological_Haldane_model_with_ultracold_fermions","257981759_Topological_invariance_and_global_Berry_phase_in_non-Hermitian_systems","255923545_Real_Spectra_in_Non-Hermitian_Hamiltonians_Having_PT_Symmetry","236936882_Electric_Quantum_Walks_with_Individual_Atoms","236197773_Dynamical_Quantum_Phase_Transitions_in_the_Transverse-Field_Ising_Model","225279078_Observation_of_Topologically_Protected_Bound_States_in_Photonic_Quantum_Walks","51185717_Decoherence_and_Disorder_in_Quantum_Walks_From_Ballistic_Spread_to_Localization","49128762_Colloquium_Topological_Insulators","45905116_Exploring_Topological_Phases_With_Quantum_Walks","43021468_Realization_of_a_Quantum_Walk_with_One_and_Two_Trapped_Ions","10963872_Complex_Extension_of_Quantum_Mechanics","2069235_Making_Sense_of_Non-Hermitian_Hamiltonians","326523378_Detecting_topological_invariants_and_revealing_topological_phase_transitions_in_discrete-time_photonic_quantum_walks","324744983_Dynamical_topological_invariants_and_reduced_rate_functions_for_dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions_in_two_dimensions","321198863_Mixed_state_dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions","320014196_Dynamical_quantum_phase_transitions_A_review","319662343_Topological_phases_in_the_non-Hermitian_Su-Schrieffer-Heeger_Model","318806382_Observation_of_topological_edge_states_in_parity-time-symmetric_quantum_walks","317164136_Dynamical_Topological_Quantum_Phase_Transitions_for_Mixed_States","316744678_Experimental_Determination_of_Dynamical_Lee-Yang_Zeros","311805211_Direct_Observation_of_Dynamical_Quantum_Phase_Transitions_in_an_Interacting_Many-Body_System","311586713_Jarzynski-like_equality_for_the_out-of-time-ordered_correlator","303556305_Experimental_reconstruction_of_the_Berry_curvature_in_a_Floquet_Bloch_band","301877183_Dynamical_Quantum_Phase_Transitions_Role_of_Topological_Nodes_in_Wave_Function_Overlaps","276210907_Scaling_and_Universality_at_Dynamical_Quantum_Phase_Transitions","275364277_Dynamical_Topological_Order_Parameters_far_from_Equilibrium","266081669_Topological_classification_of_dynamical_phase_transitions","264674024_Probing_topological_invariants_in_the_bulk_of_a_non-Hermitian_optical_system","223113202_Complex_geometrical_phases_for_dissipative_systems","200105385_Statistical_Theory_of_Equations_of_State_and_Phase_Transitions_I_Theory_of_Condensation","200104921_Statistical_Theory_of_Equations_of_State_and_Phase_Transitions_II_Lattice_Gas_and_Ising_Model","45934365_Topological_insulators_and_superconductors"]}
