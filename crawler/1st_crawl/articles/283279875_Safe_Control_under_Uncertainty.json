{"id":"283279875_Safe_Control_under_Uncertainty","abstract":"Controller synthesis for hybrid systems that satisfy temporal specifications\nexpressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn\nthe attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such\ntemporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example,\nmany of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through\nmachine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we\npropose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an\nexpressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce\nprobabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe\ncontrollers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption\nthat the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables.\nOne of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is\nadaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its\nbeliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We\ndemonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL\nspecifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and\nautonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.","authors":["Dorsa Sadigh","Ashish Kapoor"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["274094493_Computational_methods_for_stochastic_control_with_metric_interval_temporal_logic_specifications","267214343_Model_Predictive_Control_with_Signal_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","266377116_Integrating_active_sensing_into_reactive_synthesis_with_temporal_logic_constraints_under_partial_observations","263308694_Stochastic_predictive_control_of_autonomous_vehicles_in_uncertain_environments","262246559_Polynomial-Time_Verification_of_PCTL_Properties_of_MDPs_with_Convex_Uncertainties","261952679_Probably_Approximately_Correct_MDP_Learning_and_Control_With_Temporal_Logic_Constraints","258222788_Robust_Optimization","236505443_Efficient_Robust_Monitoring_for_STL","227276601_An_Introduction_to_MCMC_for_Machine_Learning","224588836_Temporal-Logic-Based_Reactive_Mission_and_Motion_Planning","224557340_Aerodynamics_and_control_of_autonomous_quadrotor_helicopters_in_aggressive_maneuvering","220958413_Robust_Satisfaction_of_Temporal_Logic_over_Real-Valued_Signals","50402307_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning_GPML_toolbox","45456878_Receding_Horizon_Control_for_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","3032141_A_time-dependent_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulation_of_reachable_sets_for_continuous_dynamic_games","312851571_Monitoring_Temporal_Properties_of_Continuous_Signals","308812095_Stochastic_model_predictive_controller_with_chance_constraints_for_comfortable_and_safe_driving_behavior_of_autonomous_vehicles","304410606_Computational_methods_for_stochastic_control_with_metric_interval_temporal_logic_specifications","303269133_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning","283097578_Reactive_Synthesis_from_Signal_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","282723724_Reachability-based_safe_learning_with_Gaussian_processes","275104239_Temporal_logic_model_predictive_control","271549876_A_probabilistic_approach_to_planning_and_control_in_autonomous_urban_driving","271076919_Bayesian_Data_Analysis","268674189_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Optimization","265908742_A_Learning_Based_Approach_to_Control_Synthesis_of_Markov_Decision_Processes_for_Linear_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","263047921_A_Stochastic_Programming_Model","261416557_Backtracking_temporal_logic_synthesis_for_uncertain_environments","261416539_Guaranteed_Safe_Online_Learning_via_Reachability_tracking_a_ground_target_using_a_quadrotor","258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","236583209_Model_Predictive_Control","227447847_Minimum-Cost_Cattle_Feed_Under_Probabilistic_Protein_Constraints","225075831_Essentials_Of_Robust_Control","225075716_Robust_control_of_a_class_of_uncertain_nonlinear_system","224250984_Chance-Constrained_Optimal_Path_Planning_With_Obstacles","221550991_Synthesis_of_Reactive1_Designs","220695580_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Optimization_2_ed","51916356_Provably_Safe_and_Robust_Learning-Based_Model_Predictive_Control","34038223_A_family_of_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference","34000771_Variational_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference","3771013_Robust_constrained_model_predictive_control_using_linear_matrix_inequalities","2751894_Robust_Constrained_Model_Predictive_Control_using_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities","2463815_Level_Set_Methods_for_Computation_in_Hybrid_Systems","2328925_A_family_of_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference"]}
