{"id":"350690100_Approximations_of_fuzzy_soft_sets_by_fuzzy_soft_relations_with_image_processing_application","abstract":"Fuzzy soft sets represent a generalization of fuzzy sets with considerable application potential in decision-making problems, optimization, and computer science. In the paper, we use the fact that the fuzzy soft sets powerset theory is defined by the monad and, using this theory, we introduce the concept of fuzzy soft relations defined by the monad. Using that general method, we can also introduce the fuzzy soft approximation of fuzzy soft sets defined by fuzzy soft relations. We show that fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy soft approximations can be naturally used in selective color segmentation problem, where reliable and fully automated methods do not yet exist.","authors":["Jiri Mockor","Petr Hurtik"],"meta":["May 2021Soft Computing 25(13):1-11","DOI:10.1007/s00500-021-05769-3"],"references":["348238495_Powerset_Theory_of_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets","341203481_The_Renewable_Energy_Source_Selection_by_Remoteness_Index-Based_VIKOR_Method_for_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets","338208938_Another_view_on_generalized_interval_valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_set_and_its_applications_in_decision_support_system","335147329_A_Novel_Approach_to_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Its_Application_in_Decision_Support_System","331906686_Generalized_Picture_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Their_Application_in_Decision_Support_Systems","308789966_Weighted_Neutrosophic_Soft_Sets","266721533_On_the_monadic_nature_of_categories_of_ordered_sets","303056279_Fuzzy_soft_sets","302301843_Partially_Ordered_Monads","265992413_Every_Standard_Construction_is_Induced_by_a_Pair_of_Adjoint_Functors","228617946_Partially_Ordered_Monads_for_Monadic_Topologies_Rough_Sets_and_Kleene_Algebras","251258177_General_Topology_-_the_Monadic_Case_Examples_Applications","243072623_Book_Review_Fuzzy_sets_and_systems_Theory_and_applications","232922774_Upper_and_lower_approximations_of_fuzzy_sets","230886116_Generalised_fuzzy_soft_sets"]}
