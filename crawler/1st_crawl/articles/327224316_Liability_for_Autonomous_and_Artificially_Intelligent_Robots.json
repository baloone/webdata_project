{"id":"327224316_Liability_for_Autonomous_and_Artificially_Intelligent_Robots","abstract":"In the backdrop of increasingly intelligent machines, important issues of law have been raised by the use of robots that operate autonomous from human supervisory control. In particular, when systems operating with autonomous robot’s damage property or injure humans, it may be difficult to determinewho’s at fault and therefore liable under current legal schemes. This paper reviews product liability and negligence tort law which may be used to allocate liability for robots that damage property or cause injury. Further, the paper concludes with a discussion of different approaches to allocating liability in an age of increasingly intelligent and autonomous robots directed by sophisticated algorithms, analytical, and computational techniques","authors":["Woodrow Barfield"],"meta":["August 2018Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics 9(1):193-203","DOI:10.1515/pjbr-2018-0018"],"references":["245326581_Deterministic_and_nondeterministic_programming_in_robot_systems","317997499_An_FDA_for_Algorithms","265428575_The_Encrypted_Self_Fleshing_Out_the_Rights_of_Electronic_Personalities","262205041_Tort_liability_for_artificial_intelligence_and_expert_systems","225249319_The_responsibility_gap_Ascribing_responsibility_for_the_actions_of_learning_automata","220671676_Liability_in_Robotics_An_International_Perspective_on_Robots_as_Animals","220414489_Learning_robots_interacting_with_humans_from_epistemic_risk_to_responsibility"]}
