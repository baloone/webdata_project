{"id":"277389125_A_Fast_Spectral_Method_for_Active_3D_Shape_Reconstruction","abstract":"Image sharpening in the presence of noise is formulated as a non-convex variational problem. The energy functional incorporates a gradient-dependent potential, a convex fidelity criterion and a high order convex regularizing term. The first term attains local minima at zero and some high gradient magnitude, thus forming a triple well-shaped potential (in the one-dimensional case). The energy minimization flow results in sharpening of the dominant edges, while most noisy fluctuations are filtered out.","authors":["Antonin Chambolle"],"meta":["January 2004Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 20(1/2):73-87","DOI:10.1023/B:JMIV.0000011320.81911.38"],"references":[]}
