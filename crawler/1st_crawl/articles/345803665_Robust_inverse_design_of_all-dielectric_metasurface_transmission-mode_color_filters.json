{"id":"345803665_Robust_inverse_design_of_all-dielectric_metasurface_transmission-mode_color_filters","abstract":"The strong dispersion, ultra-thin form-factor and robustness to degradation make metasurfaces attractive for color filter applications. In particular, transmission-mode filters using silicon could potentially replace conventional color filter arrays in backside-illuminated CMOS image sensors and enable novel multispectral image sensors. We report a robust inverse-design methodology using polygon-shaped, particle and void, meta-atoms. We predict that silicon metasurface transmission-mode primary color (RGB) filters designed with this approach exhibit enhanced color gamut, color purity and intra-pixel color uniformity in comparison to previous reports. The proposed robust inverse design procedure employs multi-island Differential Evolution whose fitness evaluation step uses a statistical model of nanofabrication imperfections. The statistical model can closely recreate the shape variations observed in micrographs of silicon metasurfaces fabricated using electron-beam lithography and is useful in guiding the optimization process towards robust designs.","authors":["Soumyashree Soumyaprakash Panda","Hardik Shyam Vyas","Ravi Sadananda Hegde"],"meta":["November 2020Optical Materials Express 10(12)","DOI:10.1364/OME.409186","Project: AI-assisted Photonics Design"],"references":["342267466_Inverse_design_of_metasurface_optical_filters_using_deep_neural_network_with_high_degrees_of_freedom","340788290_All-dielectric_metasurface_for_high-performance_structural_color","339561983_All-Dielectric_Metasurfaces_for_Reflection_and_Transmission-Mode_Color_Filter_Arrays","343089650_Meta-atom_Library_Generation_via_an_Efficient_Multi-objective_Shape_Optimization_Method","342450381_Polarization_tunable_color_filters_based_on_flexible_all-dielectric_metasurfaces","342323262_Flat_optics_with_dispersion-engineered_metasurfaces","341058495_Optical_Metasurfaces_Are_Coming_of_Age_Short-_And_Long-Term_Opportunities_for_Commercial_Applications","340640026_MetaNet_A_new_paradigm_for_data_sharing_in_photonics_research","340313800_Transmission-mode_all-dielectric_metasurface_color_filter_arrays_designed_by_evolutionary_search","339282318_Inverse-Designed_Photonics_for_Semiconductor_Foundries"]}
