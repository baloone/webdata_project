{"id":"322810599_Increased_level_of_security_using_DNA_steganography","abstract":"Security has become one of the important fields of concern when the scenario of information transport is viewed. Cryptology is a traditional technique that hides the message by encoding it. Nevertheless, now it is not only demanded that the data that is being transmitted is encoded, but the very existence of knowledge of data transmission should be concealed. Steganography is thus a technique where the data are not only encoded, but hidden within a carrier. This therefore provides a two-level security. The proposed paper describes a highly secured steganography technique using DNA sequence. The report suggests a technique of hiding an image in an image using DNA sequence.","authors":["Vijay Pv","V.
