{"id":"258373329_Unconditional_security_from_noisy_quantum_storage","abstract":"We consider the implementation of two-party cryptographic primitives\nbased on the sole physical assumption that no large-scale reliable\nquantum storage is available to the cheating party. An important example\nof such a task is secure identification. Here, Alice wants to identify\nherself to Bob (possibly an ATM machine) without revealing her password.\nMore generally, Alice and Bob wish to solve problems where Alice holds\nan input x (e.g. her password), and Bob holds an input y (e.g. the\npassword an honest Alice should possess), and they want to obtain the\nvalue of some function f(x,y) (e.g. the equality function). Security\nmeans that the legitimate users should not learn anything beyond this\nspecification. That is, Alice should not learn anything about y and Bob\nshould not learn anything about x, other than what they may be able to\ninfer from the value of f(x,y). We show that any such problem can be\nsolved securely in the noisy-storage model by constructing protocols for\nbit commitment and oblivious transfer, where we prove security against\nthe most general attack. Our protocols can be implemented with\npresent-day hardware used for quantum key distribution. In particular,\nno quantum storage is required for the honest parties. Our work raises a\nlarge number of immediate theoretical as well as experimental questions\nrelated to many aspects of quantum information science, such as for\nexample understanding the information carrying properties of quantum\nchannels and memories, randomness extraction, min-entropy sampling, as\nwell as constructing small handheld devices which are suitable for the\ntask of secure identification.
