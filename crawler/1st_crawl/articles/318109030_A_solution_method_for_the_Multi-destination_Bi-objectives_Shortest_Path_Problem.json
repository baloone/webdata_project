{"id":"318109030_A_solution_method_for_the_Multi-destination_Bi-objectives_Shortest_Path_Problem","abstract":"This paper is devoted to study the multi-destination bi-objective shortest path problem. This problem consists in finding the set of Pareto-optimal paths linking a set of points of interest in a network. Our motivation stems from the data preprocessing for vehicle routing problems on road networks. We propose a solution method based on a labeling approach with a multi-objective A* search strategy that can handle the multi-destination case. Computational results based on instances generated from real road networks show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-art approaches.","authors":["Hamza Ben Ticha","Nabil Absi","Dominique Feillet","Alain Quilliot"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.32492.05768","State: Under Submission","Project: Vehicle Routing Problems in urban areas"],"references":["278722507_Labeling_Methods_for_the_General_Case_of_the_Multi-objective_Shortest_Path_Problem_-_A_Computational_Study","263519614_Pricing_Routines_for_Vehicle_Routing_with_Time_Windows_on_Road_Networks","313498234_An_algorithm_for_the_multiobjective_shortest_path_problem_on_acyclic_networks","303444218_Multiple_criteria_decision_making","284299207_Some_considerations_about_computational_complexity_for_multiobjective_combinatorial_problems","282059174_A_survey_and_annotated_bibliography_of_multiobjective_combinatorial_optimization","265526947_A_classification_of_Bicriterion_Shortest_Path_BSP_algorithms","263369827_Multicriteria_path_and_tree_problems_Discussion_on_exact_algorithms_and_applications","248588956_9th_DIMACS_Implementation_Challenge_Shortest_Paths","242562037_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_with_Graphs"]}
