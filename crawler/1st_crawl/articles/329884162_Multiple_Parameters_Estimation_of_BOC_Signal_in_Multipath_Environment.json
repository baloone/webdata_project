{"id":"329884162_Multiple_Parameters_Estimation_of_BOC_Signal_in_Multipath_Environment","abstract":"For the multiple parameters estimation of BOC signal at the low SNR and multipath environment, the method which applies the characteristics of cyclic spectrum is developed. Firstly, the cyclic spectrum function of multipath BOC signal is derived. Then the cyclostationary property of BOC signal is analyzed. Finally, a novel parameter estimation algorithm of BOC signal, which makes use of the position of cyclic spectral peaks to estimate the carrier frequency, the subcarrier rate and PN code rate, is present. In the experiment the time-domain smoothing method is used to calculate the cyclic spectrum of BOC signal when the frequency is equal to zero in order to avoid the multidimensional search. At the same time using the method of the cumulative average can increase the SNR margin of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the multiple parameters of multipath BOC signal can be estimated effectively and the estimation performance is associated with the multipath environment.","authors":["Yang Wang","Yang Zhou"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/2018173","Conference: SMIMA 2018At: SHANGHAI CHINA"],"references":["254059267_Cancellation_of_Correlation_Side-Peaks_for_Unambiguous_BOC_Signal_Tracking","293355289_Parameters_estimation_of_multipath_direct-spread_signal_based_on_cyclic_spectrum_amplitude","260668245_Unambiguous_BOC_Modulated_Signals_Synchronization_Technique","236873007_A_Fast_Unambiguous_Acquisition_Algorithm_for_BOC-Modulated_Signals","224734073_Spectral_Correlation_of_Modulated_Signals_Part_I--Analog_Modulation","224734069_Spectral_Correlation_of_Modulated_Signals_Part_II--Digital_Modulation","34430381_Spectral_correlation_characterization_of_modulated_signals_with_application_to_signal_detection_and_source_location"]}
