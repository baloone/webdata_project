{"id":"226644554_Sex_differences_in_visual-spatial_ability_The_role_of_performance_factors","abstract":"Two studies were designed to explore the role of performance factors as sources of the frequently noted higher male scores\non visual-spatial ability tests. In the first study, the mental rotations test (MRT) was administered to male and female college\nstudents of equally high quantitative ability (based on SAT math scores). Although males had significantly more correct responses\non the test than did females, their advantage was eliminated when the ratio of correct responses to items attempted was used\nas the dependent measure. In the second study, the same test was administered to new groups of male and female college students.\nIn this sample, the males had significantly higher SAT math scores. The MRT was administered under standard, timed conditions\nand under untimed conditions. Both raw and ratio scores were calculated. With SAT math score as the covariate, analyses of\ncovariance indicated that males demonstrated higher performance in the timed, raw-score condition but not in the untimedor\nin the ratio-score conditions. The theoretical and social policy implications of these studies are discussed.","authors":["David Goldstein","Diane Haldane","Carolyn Mitchell"],"meta":["September 1990Memory & Cognition 18(5):546-550","DOI:10.3758/BF03198487"],"references":["313772082_'Sex_differences_in_the_development_of_spatial_and_linguistic_skills","297147148_Socialization_of_achievement_attitudes_and_beliefs_parental_influences","297085050_SEX-DIFFERENCES_IN_MENTAL_ABILITIES_HEMISPHERIC_LATERALIZATION_AND_RATE_OF_PHYSICAL_GROWTH_AT_ADOLESCENCE","289963662_The_Psychology_of_Sex_Differences","275935269_Sex_Differences_in_Cognitive_Abilities","261666298_On_the_Empirical_Relation_Between_Spatial_Ability_and_Sex_Differences_in_Other_Aspects_of_Cognitive_Performance","250183881_Sex-Related_Differences_in_Mathematics_Achievement_Spatial_Visualization_and_Affective_Factors","247500506_Sex_differences_in_cognitive_abilities_2nd_ed_London_Lawrence_Erlbaum_Associates","247435863_Are_Men's_and_women's_brains_really_different","233896950_Socialization_of_Achievement_Attitudes_and_Beliefs_Parental_Influences"]}
