{"id":"280014211_Binary_Offset_Carrier_Modulation_for_Radionavigation","abstract":"Current signaling for GPS employs phase shift keying (PSK) modulation using conventional rectangular (non-return to zero) spreading symbols. Attention has been focused primarily on the design of the spreading code and selection of the keying rates. But better modulation designs are available for next-generation radionavigation systems, offering improved performance and the opportunity for spectrum sharing while retaining implementation simplicity. This paper describes a class of particularly attractive modulations called binary offset carrier (BOC). It presents important characteristics of modulations for radionavigation, introduces several specific BOC designs that satisfy different applications in evolving radionavigation systems, describes receiver processing for these modulations, and provides analytical and numerical results that describe the modulations' performance and demonstrate advantages over comparable conventional PSK modulations with rectangular spreading symbols.","authors":["J.W.
