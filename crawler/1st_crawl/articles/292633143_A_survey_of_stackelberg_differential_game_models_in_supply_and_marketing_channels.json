{"id":"292633143_A_survey_of_stackelberg_differential_game_models_in_supply_and_marketing_channels","abstract":"Stackelberg differential game models have been used to study sequential decision making in\nnoncooperative games in diverse fields. In this paper, we survey recent applications of Stackelberg\ndifferential game models to the supply chain management and marketing channels literatures. A\ncommon feature of these applications is the specification of the game structure: a decentralized channel\ncomposed of a manufacturer and independent retailers, and a sequential decision procedure with\ndemand and supply dynamics and coordination issues. In supply chain management, Stackelberg\ndifferential games have been used to investigate inventory issues, wholesale and retail pricing\nstrategies, and outsourcing in dynamic environments. The underlying demand typically has growth\ndynamics or seasonal variation. In marketing, Stackelberg differential games have been used to model\ncooperative advertising programs, store brand and national brand advertising strategies, shelf space\nallocation, and pricing and advertising decisions. The demand dynamics are usually extensions of the\nclassical advertising capital models or sales-advertising response models. We begin by explaining the\nStackelberg differential game solution methodology and then provide a description of the models and\nresults reported in the literature.","authors":["Xiuli He","A.
