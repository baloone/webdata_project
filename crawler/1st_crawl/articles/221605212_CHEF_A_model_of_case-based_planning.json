{"id":"221605212_CHEF_A_model_of_case-based_planning","abstract":"Case-based planning is based on the idea that a machine planner should make use of its own past experience in developing new plans, relying on its memories instead of a base of rules. Memories of past successes are accessed and modified to create new plans. Memories of past failures are used to warn the planner of impending problems and memories of past repairs are called upon to tell the planner how to deal with them.","authors":["Kristian Hammond"],"meta":["January 1986","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 5th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
