{"id":"255909290_Nonlinearity_measures_of_random_Boolean_functions","abstract":"The r-th order nonlinearity of a Boolean function is the minimum number of\nelements that have to be changed in its truth table to arrive at a Boolean\nfunction of degree at most r. It is shown that the (suitably normalised) r-th\norder nonlinearity of a random Boolean function converges strongly for all r\\ge\n1. This extends results by Rodier for r=1 and by Dib for r=2. The methods in\nthe present paper are mostly of elementary combinatorial nature and also lead\nto simpler proofs in the cases that r=1 or 2.","authors":["Kai-Uwe Schmidt"],"meta":["October 2016Cryptography and Communications 8(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-015-0164-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","228615136_Weight_distribution_and_list-decoding_size_of_Reed-Muller_codes","224093774_Typical_Peak_Sidelobe_Level_of_Binary_Sequences","324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","248757134_On_a_Result_of_Salem_and_Zygmund_Concerning_Random_Polynomials","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","236736804_On_the_method_of_bounded_differences","225161396_Distribution_of_Boolean_Functions_According_to_the_Second-Order_Nonlinearity","221463109_Weight_Distribution_and_List-Decoding_Size_of_Reed-Muller_Codes","221348640_Non-Linear_Approximations_in_Linear_Cryptanalysis","220638891_Asymptotic_Nonlinearity_of_Boolean_Functions","220533766_On_the_Distribution_of_Boolean_Function_Nonlinearity","220349114_On_Cryptographic_Properties_of_Random_Boolean_Functions"]}
