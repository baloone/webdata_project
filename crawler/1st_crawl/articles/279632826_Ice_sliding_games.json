{"id":"279632826_Ice_sliding_games","abstract":"This paper deals with sliding games, which are a variant of the better known\npushpush game. On a given structure (grid, torus...), a robot can move in a\nspecific set of directions, and stops when it hits a block or boundary of the\nstructure. The objective is to place the minimum number of blocks such that the\nrobot can visit all the possible positions of the structure. In particular, we\ngive the exact value of this number when playing on a rectangular grid and a\ntorus. Other variants of this game are also considered, by constraining the\nrobot to stop on each case, or by replacing blocks by walls.","authors":["Paul Dorbec","Eric Duchêne","André Fabbri","Julien Moncel"],"meta":["May 2018International Journal of Game Theory 47(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00182-017-0607-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["250419789_On_the_Complexity_of_Randolph's_Robot_Game","268022175_The_computational_complexity_of_motion_planning","247815509_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Motion_Planning","247161853_Robot_Motion_Planning","242044280_Ricochet_Robots_-_A_Case_Study_for_Human_Complex_Problem_Solving","236853724_Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays","225149670_Playing_Games_with_Algorithms_Algorithmic_Combinatorial_Game_Theory","50199526_The_Domination_Number_of_Grids","27187054_Total_domination_numbers_of_Cartesian_products"]}
