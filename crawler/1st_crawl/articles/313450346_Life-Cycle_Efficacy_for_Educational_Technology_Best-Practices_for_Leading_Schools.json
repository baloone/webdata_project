{"id":"313450346_Life-Cycle_Efficacy_for_Educational_Technology_Best-Practices_for_Leading_Schools","abstract":"Though the process of qualitative analytical research, historical analysis is applied to evaluate the degree to which public K-12 school districts in Central New York are transparently reporting information regarding their educational technology and whether this process of communication aligns with a literature-based framework for educational technology life-cycle efficacy. Through digital artifact analysis of 10 educational school districts, which account for roughly 52,000 students and annual budget allocations of $840 million, the authors conclude that this sample of school districts were not transparently communicating information pertaining to educational technology and their life-cycle efficacy was not being communicated in accordance with best-practices acknowledged in relevant literature.","authors":["Jason MacLeod","Harrison Hao Yang"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1109/EITT.2016.34","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Educational Innovation through Technology (EITT)"],"references":["305505401_Fostering_market_efficiency_in_K-12_ed-tech_procurement","298252001_Educational_Technology_Decision-Making_Technology_Acquisition_for_746000_Ontario_Students","285983212_Challenges_School_Principals_Facing_in_the_Context_of_Technology_Leadership","271863134_Concerns_Considerations_and_New_Ideas_for_Data_Collection_and_Research_in_Educational_Technology_Studies","233792797_Measuring_the_Effectiveness_of_Educational_Technology_what_are_we_Attempting_to_Measure","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","280113737_What_You_Think_You_Know_About_the_Web_is_Wrong","266273409_Literature_Review_Educational_Technology","263452054_The_literature_landscape_of_blended_learning_in_higher_education_The_need_for_better_understanding_of_academic_blended_practice","260994969_The_relationship_between_technology_leadership_strategies_and_effectiveness_of_school_administration_An_empirical_study","235288728_Working_with_ICT_Perceptions_of_Australian_principals","223835923_Cultural_Differences_in_Teaching_and_Learning","44837603_Educational_Research_Fundamentals_for_the_Consumer"]}
