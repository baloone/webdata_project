{"id":"271460421_User_Service_Oriented_Power_Allocation_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are made up of many tiny physiological sensors implanted in/on the human body that communicate with a coordinator. In the case that multiple WBANs coexist, the signal interference between neighboring WBANs pose challenges and difficulties on resource allocation and service Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee. In this paper, we propose a power allocation algorithm to mitigate inter-network interference and improve energy efficiency of the WBANs with heterogeneous services sensors of different QoS requirements. The minimal total power optimization problem is formulated and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to solve the problem. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm is capable of guaranteeing users QoS requirements.","authors":["Huili Zhang","Qianbin Chen","Cui Su","Rong Chai"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1049/cp.2013.2373","Conference: 5th IET International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (ICWMMN 2013)"],"references":["221287910_Distributed_Inter-Network_Interference_Coordination_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","220466214_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_for_Pervasive_Health_Monitoring_Systems_with_Body_Sensor_Networks","261400861_Design_considerations_of_reinforcement_learning_power_controllers_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","251937627_A_joint_optimization_method_of_genetic_algorithm_and_numerical_algorithm_based_on_MATLAB","221639673_A_Novel_Genetic-Fuzzy_Power_Controller_with_Feedback_for_Interference_Mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","221172120_A_Performance_Evaluation_of_Cooperative_Schemes_for_On-Body_Area_Networks_Based_on_Measured_Time-Variant_Channels","220689401_An_Introduction_to_Genetic_Algorithms_MIT_Press_Cambridge","201976815_Genetic_Algorithms_Engineering_Design","3159916_On_the_Performance_of_Adaptive_Modulation_in_Cellular_Systems"]}
