{"id":"300885720_Mersenne-Walsh_Matrices_for_Image_Processing","abstract":"This paper presents a modified Paley method for calculation of Mersenne matrices at order values equal to odd prime numbers. Some examples of Mersenne matrix sorting, allowing for calculation of the complete set of functions, are also considered. A comparison of Walsh and Mersenne-Walsh systems of functions in terms of their properties and fields of application is provided. The efficiency of this topic for use in the development of band-pass filters is indicated.","authors":["Nikolay Balonin","Anton Vostrikov","Mikhail Sergeev"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19830-9_13","In book: Intelligent Interactive Multimedia Systems and Services (pp.141-147)"],"references":["302222704_On_orthogonal_matrices","297751775_Mersenne_and_Hadamard_Matrices","295105065_On_existence_of_Mersenne_and_Hadamard_matrices","287466131_Construction_of_transformation_basis_for_video_and_image_masking_procedures","287466130_Implementation_of_novel_quasi-orthogonal_matrices_for_simultaneous_images_compression_and_protection","280207998_Generalized_Mersenne_matrices_and_Balonin's_conjecture","268616197_Resolution_d'une_question_relative_aux_derminants","242608898_A_Remarkable_Series_of_Orthogonal_Functions_I","237104285_A_Closed_Set_of_Normal_Orthogonal_Functions","226304524_Einige_Stze_ber_Reihen_von_allgemeinen_Orthogonalfunktionen","224581785_Applications_of_Walsh_functions_in_communications"]}
