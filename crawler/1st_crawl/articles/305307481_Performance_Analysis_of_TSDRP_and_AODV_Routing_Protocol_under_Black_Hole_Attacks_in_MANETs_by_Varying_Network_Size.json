Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector\n(AODV) is a very popular routing protocol of MANETs, but\nit has no security measures in-built and vulnerable to many\ntypes of attacks. Black hole attack at network layer is the\nmost attention seeking attack in AODV routing protocol.\nThis paper study the impact of network size of our propose\nTrust Based Secure On Demand Routing Protocol called\n“TSDRP” and AODV routing protocol for making it secure\nto thwart Blackhole attack. To evaluate the performances,\nwe have considered Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF),\nAverage End-to-End Delay (AED), Average Throughput\n(AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL).","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey","Keyur Jani","Savita Gandhi","Akshai Aggarwal"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/ACCT.2015.62","Conference: Fifth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies (ACCT 2015),At: Rohtak","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["277255608_Optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_OLSR","275605114_AODV_Robust_AODVR_An_Analytic_Approach_to_Shield_Ad-hoc_Networks_from_Black_Holes","270394473_Optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_OLSRP","264897273_Performace_Evaluation_of_AODV_variants_on_DDoS_Blackhole_and_Malicious_Attacks","260409751_Trust_Based_Secure_on_Demand_Routing_Protocol_TSDRP_for_MANETs","260127250_Performance_Analysis_of_AODV_DSDV_and_DSR_in_MANETs","258396739_A_Credible_Routing_Based_on_a_Novel_Trust_Mechanism_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks","257884638_A_survey_of_black_hole_attacks_in_wireless_mobile_Ad_hoc_networks","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","284602927_Ad_hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing"]}
