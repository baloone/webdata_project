{"id":"269417652_Optimization_of_Software_Quality_Using_Management_and_Technical_Review_Techniques","abstract":"Optimizing the quality of software is a function of the degree of reviews\nmade during the early life of a software development process. Reviews detect\nerrors and potential errors early in the software development process. The\nerrors detected during the early life cycle of software are least expensive to\ncorrect. Efficient involvement in software inspections and technical reviews,\nhelp developers improve their own skills, thereby mitigating the occurrence of\nerrors in the later stage of software development process. The ideas gathered\non this paper point that a properly implemented program of technical and\nmanagement reviews drastically reduces the time as well as the cost required\nfor testing, debugging, and reworking, and dramatically improves the quality of\nthe resulting product. This paper, Optimization of Software Quality using\nmanagement and technical Review Techniques, provides its readers with the\nopportunity to learn about and experience using this indispensable software\nquality tools.","authors":["Inibehe Emmanuel Akpannah"],"meta":["December 2014International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology 17(6)","DOI:10.14445/22312803/IJCTT-V17P154","SourcearXiv"],"references":["298293111_How_to_make_software_peer_reviews_work","242516862_Software_project_surviaval_guide","224101964_Design_and_Code_Inspections_to_Reduce_Errors_in_Program_Development","220691208_Managing_Software_Process","220425359_An_Improved_Inspection_Technique","220069307_Advances_in_Software_Inspections","2297584_The_Software_Technical_Review_Process"]}
