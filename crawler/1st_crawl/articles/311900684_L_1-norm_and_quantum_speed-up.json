{"id":"311900684_L_1-norm_and_quantum_speed-up","abstract":"In theoretical quantum computer science, understanding where and how computational speed-ups occur while applying quantum properties is a primary goal. In this paper, we study such problem under the framework of Quantum Query Model and prove the significance of $L_1$-norm in the simulation of a given quantum algorithm. This result is presented by upper-bounds for the quotient between optimal classical complexity and the complexity of the given quantum algorithm.","authors":["S. A.
