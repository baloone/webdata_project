{"id":"262739455_Questoes_acerca_do_coping_A_proposito_do_estudo_de_adaptacao_do_Brief_COPE","abstract":"The primary purpose of the present paper is to identify the psychometric properties of the short form of the COPE scale named Brief-COPE. Participants are 364 individuals, 41.5% males, with similar characteristics of the participants in Carver's study. The translation of the Brief-COPE followed standard procedures (translation, back translation, reconciliation, cultural equivalence verification of translation, identification of content validity, cognitive debriefing). Statistical procedures followed the original model. Portuguese version that emerges from the present study shows similar patterns to the original version. The Portuguese version proposed seems to be a good adaptation of the original one, and a useful instrument to be used in health psychology.","authors":["Jose Pais-Ribeiro","A.P.
