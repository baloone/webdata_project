{"id":"316260943_Short_lists_with_short_programs_in_short_time","abstract":"Given a machine U, a c-short program for x is a string p such that U(p) = x and the length of p is bounded by c + (the length of a shortest program for x). We show that for any standard Turing machine, it is possible to compute in polynomial time on input x a list of polynomial size guaranteed to contain a \\({\\operatorname{O}\\bigl({\\mathrm{log}}|x|\\bigr)}\\)-short program for x. We also show that there exists a computable function that maps every x to a list of size |x|2 containing a \\({\\operatorname{O}\\bigl(1\\bigr)}\\)-short program for x. This is essentially optimal because we prove that for each such function there is a c and infinitely many x for which the list has size at least c|x|2. Finally we show that for some standard machines, computable functions generating lists with 0-short programs must have infinitely often list sizes proportional to 2|x|.","authors":["Bruno Bauwens","Anton Makhlin","Nikolay Vereshchagin","Marius Zimand"],"meta":["March 2018computational complexity 27(02):1-31","DOI:10.1007/s00037-017-0154-2"],"references":["292334872_Computability_in_statistical_hypotheses_testing_and_characterizations_of_independence_and_directed_influences_in_time_series_using_Kolmogorov_complexity","284090758_On_the_symmetry_of_algorithmic_information","262358606_Game_Arguments_in_Computability_Theory_and_Algorithmic_Information_Theory","235359712_Short_Lists_with_Short_Programs_in_Short_Time_-_A_Short_Proof","313171841_On_representatives_of_subsets","276370573_Algorithmic_Minimal_Sufficient_Statistics_a_New_Approach","267054521_Generating_Kolmogorov_random_strings_from_sources_with_limited_independence","265351877_On_a_problem_of_K_Zarankiewicz","255593989_Kolmogorov_complexity_and_games","247022519_On_Some_Games_Which_Are_Relevant_to_the_Theory_of_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets"]}
