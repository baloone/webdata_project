{"id":"320609700_A_Review_on_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_Tasks_and_Applications","abstract":"Machine learning is a field of computer science which gives computers an ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is used in a variety of computational tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is not easy. Applications include email filtering, recognition of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach. One of the foundation objectives of machine learning is to train computers to utilize data to solve a specified problem. A good number of applications of machine learning like classifier training on email messages in order to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages, fraud detection etc. In this article we will focus on basics of machine learning, machine learning tasks and problems and various machine learning algorithms.","authors":["Diksha Sharma","Neeraj Kumar"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":["319178767_Challenges_Involved_in_Big_Data_Processing_Methods_to_Solve_Big_Data_Processing_Problems","303850262_Offline_Handwritten_Gurmukhi_Character_Recognition_A_Review","301779181_SUPERVISED_MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES_A_SURVEY","271207614_DESIGN_AND_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RFID_BASED_INTELLIGENT_SECURITY_SYSTEM","315336330_Thesaurus_Artificial_Intelligence_Machine_Learning"]}
