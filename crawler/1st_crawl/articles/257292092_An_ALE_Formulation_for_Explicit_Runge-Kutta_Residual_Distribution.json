{"id":"257292092_An_ALE_Formulation_for_Explicit_Runge-Kutta_Residual_Distribution","abstract":"We consider the solution of hyperbolic\nconservation laws on moving meshes by means of an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Runge-Kutta RD schemes of Ricchiuto and Abgrall (J.Comput.Phys 229, 2010). Up to the authors knowledge, the problem of recasting RD schemes into ALE framework has been solved with first order explicit schemes and with second order implicit schemes. Our resulting scheme is explicit and second order accurate when computing discontinuous solutions.","authors":["RÃ©mi Abgrall","Luca Arpaia","Mario Ricchiuto"],"meta":["October 2013Journal of Scientific Computing 63(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-014-9910-5"],"references":["309431178_An_interpolation-free_two-dimensional_conservative_ale_scheme_over_adaptive_unstructured_grids_for_rotorcraft_aerodynamics","304347495_A_finite_difference_method_for_the_numerical_computation_of_discontinuous_solutions_of_the_equations_of_fluid_dynamics","303350926_Multigrid_solution_of_monotone_second-order_discretizations_of_hyperbolic_conservation_laws","289877944_Improving_Monotonicity_of_the_2_nd_Order_Backward_Difference_Time_Integration_Scheme_by_Temporal_Limiting","287986829_Residual_distribution_schemes_for_conservation_laws_via_adaptive_quadrature","284670018_A_multiple_grid_scheme_for_solving_Euler_equations","269062143_Progress_on_multidimensional_upwind_Euler_solvers_for_unstructured_grids","268308876_Compact_cell_vertex_convection_schemes_on_unstructured_meshes","266754927_Fluctuations_and_signals_-_A_framework_for_numerical_evolution_problems","265461957_Conservation_de_la_positivite_lors_de_la_discretisation_des_problemes_d'evolution_paraboliques"]}
