In conditions of informatization of education it is necessary to further improve methodical learning system course Informatics in primary school through evidence-based implementation of augmented reality technologies within specific approaches. The article offered two approaches to creating and using Visual learning tools Informatics using augmented reality technologies in primary school. The first approach is the creation of virtual models displayed on the material out of a real object. The second approach is the creation of a virtual information layer on a real object. Each of the approaches highlighted scope and limitation of use. This article provides examples of Visual teaching tools developed and training tasks in the framework of the proposed approaches, which are invariant in nature and do not depend on specific tools and technical implementation.","authors":["A.V.
