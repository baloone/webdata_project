{"id":"322643713_Archaeologies_of_Touch_Interfacing_with_Haptics_from_Electricity_to_Computing","abstract":"A material history of haptics technology that raises new questions about the relationship between touch and media David Parisi offers the first full history of new computing technologies known as haptic interfaces-which use electricity, vibration, and force feedback to stimulate the sense of touch-showing how the efforts of scientists and engineers over the past 300 years have gradually remade and redefined our sense of touch. Through lively analyses of electrical machines, videogames, sex toys, sensory substitution systems, robotics, and human-computer interfaces, Parisi shows how the materiality of touch technologies has been shaped by attempts to transform humans into more efficient processors of information. With haptics becoming ever more central to emerging virtual-reality platforms, wearable computers, and smartphones, Archaeologies of Touch offers a timely and provocative engagement with the long history of touch technology that helps us confront and question the power relations underpinning the project of giving touch its own set of technical media.","authors":["David Parisi"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.5749/j.ctt20mvgvz","Publisher: University of MinnesotaISBN: 978-1-5179-0059-5"],"references":["30937001_Motor_sensations_on_the_skin"]}
