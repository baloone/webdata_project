{"id":"302983105_Factors_that_Influence_Undergraduate_Information-seeking_Behavior_and_Opportunities_for_Student_Success","abstract":"Informed from a survey we administered to undergraduate students on their information seeking behavior, we identify variables that influence how students conduct their search for sources, what types of sources they select, and what attributes of their sources they value. These variables relate to student academic characteristics, demographics, and actions that have been taken by instructors and library staff. With a thorough understanding of students' information seeking process and its influences, we find opportunities for instructors and librarians to have a positive influence.","authors":["Sloan Komissarov","James Murray"],"meta":["May 2016The Journal of Academic Librarianship 42(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.acalib.2016.04.007"],"references":["24419737_Early_Sensorineural_Hearing_Loss_in_ObOb_Mouse_an_Animal_Model_of_Type_2_Diabetes","285413295_Google_vs_the_Library_Part_II_Student_Search_Patterns_and_Behaviors_when_Using_Google_and_a_Federated_Search_Tool","272431411_Google_vs_the_Library_Part_III_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Sources_Found_by_Undergraduates","265840144_Google_vs_the_Library_Student_Preferences_and_Perceptions_When_Doing_Research_Using_Google_and_a_Federated_Search_Tool","265762270_Examining_Student_Research_Choices_and_Processes_in_a_Disintermediated_Searching_Environment","235303022_Information-seeking_behaviour_of_undergraduate_biology_students_A_comparative_analysis_of_first_year_and_final_year_students_in_University_College_Dublin"]}
