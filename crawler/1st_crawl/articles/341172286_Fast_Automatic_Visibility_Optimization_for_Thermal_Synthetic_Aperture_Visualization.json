{"id":"341172286_Fast_Automatic_Visibility_Optimization_for_Thermal_Synthetic_Aperture_Visualization","abstract":"In this letter, we describe and validate the first fully automatic parameter optimization for thermal synthetic aperture visualization. It replaces previous manual exploration of the parameter space, which is time-consuming and error-prone. We prove that the visibility of targets in thermal integral images is proportional to the variance of the targets' image. Since this is invariant to occlusion, it represents a suitable objective function for optimization. Our findings have the potential to enable fully autonomous search and recuse operations with camera drones.","authors":["Kurmi Indrajit","David C.
