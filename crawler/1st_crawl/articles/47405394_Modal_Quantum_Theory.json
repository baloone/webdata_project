{"id":"47405394_Modal_Quantum_Theory","abstract":"We present a discrete model theory similar in structure to ordinary quantum\nmechanics, but based on a finite field instead of complex amplitudes. The\ninterpretation of this theory involves only the \"modal\" concepts of possibility\nand necessity rather than quantitative probability measures. Despite its\nsimplicity, our model theory includes entangled states and has versions of both\nBell's theorem and the no cloning theorem.","authors":["Benjamin Schumacher","Michael Westmoreland"],"meta":["October 2010Foundations of Physics 42(7)","DOI:10.1007/s10701-012-9650-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235529670_Spekkens_RW_Evidence_for_the_epistemic_view_of_quantum_states_a_toy_theory_Phys_Rev_A_75_032110","47860189_Informational_derivation_of_Quantum_Theory","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","255893222_Foundations_of_Quaternion_Quantum_Mechanics","243648610_A_New_Introduction_to_Modal_Logic","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","228109469_On_the_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox","226096736_Quantum_nonlocality_as_an_axiom","13242964_Communication_via_one-_and_two-particle_operators_on_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_states"]}
