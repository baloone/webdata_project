{"id":"319054598_Web_and_virtual_reality_as_platforms_to_improve_online_education_experiences","abstract":"Some universities and schools have offered virtual courses to their students as part of their official curriculum. Online learning is a coherent approach for contemporary education; however, some studies show it has some weaknesses that could be addressed to enhance its potential. In this paper, we argue how virtual reality improve online learning in some aspects, such as giving students the sense of presence in an immersive world, and bringing a new way to interact with colleagues and teachers when they are not in the same place. We also discuss the role of WebVR as an open platform to bring new possibilities to explore virtual reality worlds in education.","authors":["Diogo Cortiz","Jefferson O.
