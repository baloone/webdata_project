{"id":"328933169_An_Evaluation_of_Primary_School_Children_Coding_Using_a_Text-Based_Language_Java","abstract":"All primary school children in England are required to write computer programs and learn about computational thinking. There are moves in other countries to this effect such as the U.S. K-12 Computer Science Framework (CSF) for development. Debates on how to program and what constitutes computational thinking are ongoing. Here we report on a study of programing by children aged 7 – 11 using Java and elements of computational thinking they experience. Our platform comprises a novel Story-Writing-Coding engine we have developed. We compare novice (children’s) processes of coding an animated story with that of experts (college students) and evaluate the differences using four measures based on the progressive coding of a complete program. We also analyze the use of novice (children’s) computational thinking in this coding process. This research is set against a backdrop of approaches to teaching programing and concepts of computational thinking in recent educational literature.","authors":["Colin Price","Ruth Price-Mohr"],"meta":["November 2018Computers in the Schools 35(2):1-18","DOI:10.1080/07380569.2018.1531613"],"references":["322590807_Stories_children_write_while_coding_a_cross-disciplinary_approach_for_the_primary_classroom","315636456_Computational_thinking_for_teacher_education","308748624_Bricolage_Programming_and_Problem_Solving_Ability_in_Young_Children_An_Exploratory_Study","274309848_Computational_Thinking","338743979_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_and_Coding_in_Primary_Schools","324382580_Meta-Analytic_Procedures_for_Social_Research","313085751_The_narrative_construction_of_reality","300918005_Scratch_A_Way_to_Logo_and_Python","299364601_Evidence_of_assessing_computational_thinking","276555166_From_Scratch_to_Real_Programming"]}
