{"id":"349924975_SymSpell_and_LSTM_based_Spell-_Checkers_for_Tamil","abstract":"Spell checker is an invisible but indispensable component of a very large chunk of computer usersâ€™ lives. It comes with most softwares that manipulate text like office suites that include from simple note-taking to fully versatile word processors and search engines. Spell checkers tokenize text and verify whether the text contains spelling and grammatical errors. Existing spell checkers, though work for most european languages, do not account for linguistic features of the Indian languages like Tamil. In addition, the issues with encoding representation of Tamil under unicode adds even more complexity on how the Tamil text should be handled for applications like spell checking. We implement and test three different spell checkers for Tamil namely bloom-filter, symspell, LSTM based spell checkers. Symspell is very fast for validation and lookup suggestions. LSTM implementation though not accurate enough for day to day use, is an interesting line of work that remains unexplored.","authors":["Selvakumar Murugan","Tamil Arasan Bakthavatchalam","Malaikannan Sankarasubbu"],"meta":["November 2020","Conference: Tamil Internet Conference, 2020At: India","Project: Natural language processing"],"references":["13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","308646556_Google's_Neural_Machine_Translation_System_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Human_and_Machine_Translation"]}
