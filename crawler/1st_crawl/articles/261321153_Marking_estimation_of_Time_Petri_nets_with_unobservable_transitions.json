{"id":"261321153_Marking_estimation_of_Time_Petri_nets_with_unobservable_transitions","abstract":"In this paper we present a procedure for the marking estimation of a Time Petri net system in the presence of unobservable (silent) transitions. Starting from the State Class Graph presented by Berthomieu and Diaz, we introduce a new graph called Modified State Class Graph that gives a representation of the evolution of the timed system. Then, we present a procedure that, given a timed observation, i.e., a sequence of observable transitions with their firing time instants, and a time instant τ, allows one to determine in which markings the system can be at time τ by solving a certain number of linear programming problems.","authors":["Francesco Basile","Maria Paola Cabasino","Carla Seatzu"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/ETFA.2013.6648063","Conference: Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA), 2013 IEEE 18th Conference on"],"references":["261096025_State_Observer_synthesis_of_real-time_systems_modeled_by_P-Time_Petri_nets","260711455_Diagnosability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Labeled_Petri_Nets","260661823_A_New_Approach_for_Diagnosability_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_Using_Verifier_Nets","224396499_An_Efficient_Approach_for_Online_Diagnosis_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","224145197_Parallel_batch_pattern_BP_training_algorithm_of_recurrent_neural_network","221026993_Comparison_of_Different_Semantics_for_Time_Petri_Nets","220308485_Improvement_of_parallelization_efficiency_of_batch_pattern_BP_training_algorithm_using_Open_MPI","45925536_Dynamic_Observers_for_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Timed_Systems","29611374_Efficient_On-the-Fly_Algorithms_for_Partially_Observable_Timed_Games","3032160_Fault_diagnosis_in_discrete-event_systems_Incorporating_timing_information","3031458_Diagnosis_of_asynchronous_discrete-event_systems_A_net_unfolding_approach","3022357_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","3021645_Supervisory_control_of_timed_discrete-event_systems","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","274013925_State_Estimation_and_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Labeled_Time_Petri_Net_Systems_With_Unobservable_Transitions","271455578_Fault_Detection_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets_and_Integer_Linear_Programming","271416197_A_monitoring_approach_for_discrete_event_systems_based_on_a_time_Petri_net_model","270285420_modelling_and_verication_of_time_dependant_systems_using_time_petri_nets","269075140_On_State_Estimation_of_Timed_Choice-Free_Petri_Nets","266237786_Control_of_discrete-event_systems_Automata_and_Petri_net_perspectives","261448622_Fault_Diagnosis_Graph_of_time_Petri_nets","259159027_Overview_of_fault_diagnosis_methods_for_Discrete_Event_Systems","257426975_A_hybrid_model_for_real_time_simulation_of_urban_traffic","256660817_Diagnosability_of_labeled_Petri_nets_via_Integer_Linear_Programming","242633404_A_Study_of_Recoverability_of_Computing_Systems","234796875_Analysis_of_asynchronous_concurrent_systems_by_timed_Petri_Nets","229218415_Discrete_event_diagnosis_using_labeled_Petri_nets_An_application_to_manufacturing_systems","225429733_Parallel_Implementations_of_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Learning","224085485_Efficiency_Research_of_Batch_and_Single_Pattern_MLP_Parallel_Training_Algorithms","223795888_A_distributed_approach_for_fault_detection_and_diagnosis_based_on_Time_Petri_Nets","222645987_Fault_detection_for_discrete_event_systems_using_Petri_nets_with_unobservable_transitions","221654905_Fault_Diagnosis_for_Timed_Automata","220652027_State_Estimation_of_lambda-free_Labeled_Petri_Nets_with_Contact-Free_Nondeterministic_Transitions","220349733_A_Chronicle-based_Diagnosability_Approach_for_Discrete_Timed-event_Systems_Application_to_Web-Services","220284578_Study_of_neural_net_training_methods_in_parallel_and_distributed_architectures","44390145_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Timed_Systems","4278222_Improving_on-line_fault_diagnosis_for_discrete_event_systems_using_time","3187356_Diaz_M_Modeling_and_verification_of_time_dependent_systems_using_time_Petri_nets_IEEE_Trans_Softw_Eng_17_259-273","3024488_Observability_of_PlaceTransition_nets","3024475_Polynomial-time_verification_of_diagnosability_of_partially_observed_discrete-event_systems","2984167_Analysis_and_Applications_Proceedings_of_the_IEEE_774_541-580","2584668_Multilayer_Neural_Networks_Learning_Models_and_Applications"]}
