{"id":"17619072_Primary_auditory_stream_segregation_and_perception_of_order_in_rapid_sequences_of_tones","abstract":"Examined the finding by R. Warren, C. Obusek, R. Farmer, and R. Warren (see record) that listeners were unable to judge the order of 3 or 4 nonspeech sounds presented in a repetitive cycle. 2 experiments with 32 and 21 undergraduates show that at high presentation rates of a short cycle of 3 high and 3 low tones, Ss invariably segregated the tone sequences into streams based on frequency and could perceive only those patterns relating elements of the same subjective stream.
