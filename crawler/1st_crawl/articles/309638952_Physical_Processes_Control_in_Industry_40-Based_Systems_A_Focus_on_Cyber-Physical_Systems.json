{"id":"309638952_Physical_Processes_Control_in_Industry_40-Based_Systems_A_Focus_on_Cyber-Physical_Systems","abstract":"Industry 4.0 or cyber-industry may employ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) profusely to organize production media in a new and more efficient way. Many processes might be defined in CPS and Industry 4.0, however, physical processes are probably the least studied. Therefore, in this paper we propose an architecture for Industry 4.0-based systems focused on the control of physical processes. The architecture follows the CPS paradigm. Moreover, a first evaluation of the performance of the proposed solution, using simulation tools, is provided. The results proved the proposed architecture is a valid solution for physical control processes.","authors":["Borja Bordel Sánchez","Diego Sánchez de Rivera","Álvaro Sánchez-Picot","Tomas Robles"],"meta":["November 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-48799-1_30","Conference: Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence"],"references":["284710995_TF4SM_A_Framework_for_Developing_Traceability_Solutions_in_Small_Manufacturing_Companies","269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","269294836_Cyber_physical_systems_in_the_context_of_Industry_40","250017682_Cyber-Physical_Systems_-_Are_Computing_Foundations_Adequate","228414332_A_Prototype_architecture_for_cyber-physical_systems"]}
