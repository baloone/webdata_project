{"id":"316407064_An_Extension_of_the_VSM_Documents_Representation","abstract":"In this paper we will present a new approach regarding the documents representation in order to be used in classification and/or clustering algorithms. In our new representation we will start from the classical \"bag-of-words\" representation but we will augment each word with its correspondent part-of-speech. Thus we will introduce a new concept called hyper-vectors where each document is represented in a hyper-space where each dimension is a different part-of-speech component. For each dimension the document is represented using the Vector Space Model (VSM). In this work we will use only five different parts of speech: noun, verb, adverb, adjective and others. In the hyper-space each dimension has a different weight. To compute the similarity between two documents we have developed a new hyper-cosine formula. Some interesting classification experiments are presented as validation cases.","authors":["Lucian Vintan","Daniel Ionel Morariu","Radu George Cretulescu","Maria Vintan"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Computers, Communications & Control (IJCCC) 12(3):403-414","DOI:10.15837/ijccc.2017.3.2889"],"references":["314914794_Part-of-speech_labeling_for_Reuters_database","264743842_Part_of_Speech_Tagging_with_Naive_Bayes_Methods","220691324_Mining_the_Web_Discovering_Knowledge_from_Hypertext_Data","200045863_Foundations_of_Statistical_Natural_Language_Processing"]}
