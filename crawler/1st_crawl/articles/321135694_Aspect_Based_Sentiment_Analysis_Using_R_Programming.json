{"id":"321135694_Aspect_Based_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_R_Programming","abstract":"The customers, when they buy the products online from e-commerce websites, often tend to rate these products and give reviews on that product. This rating/review system often helps the other potential customers to decide whether to purchase that product or not. However, reading all of the available reviews on a particular product, often make the customer invest a lot of time in this process as abundance of places such as blogs, review sites, etc. contain reviews. The process of sentiment analysis aims at reducing this time of the customer by displaying the data in a compact format in the form of means, analysis score, or simply histograms. The sentiment analysis procedure shown in this paper can be extended to the reviews of products in different domains. The experimental results have shown that this method exhibits better performance.","authors":["Akhil Kintali","G. V.
