{"id":"222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","abstract":"The soft set theory offers a general mathematical tool for dealing with uncertain, fuzzy, not clearly defined objects. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the basic notions of the theory of soft sets, to present the first results of the theory, and to discuss some problems of the future.","authors":["Dmitri A.
