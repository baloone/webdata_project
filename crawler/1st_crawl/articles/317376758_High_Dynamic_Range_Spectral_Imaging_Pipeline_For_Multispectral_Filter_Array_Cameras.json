{"id":"317376758_High_Dynamic_Range_Spectral_Imaging_Pipeline_For_Multispectral_Filter_Array_Cameras","abstract":"Spectral filter arrays imaging exhibits a strong similarity with color filter arrays. This permits us to embed this technology in practical vision systems with little adaptation of the existing solutions. In this communication, we define an imaging pipeline that permits high dynamic range (HDR)-spectral imaging, which is extended from color filter arrays. We propose an implementation of this pipeline on a prototype sensor and evaluate the quality of our implementation results on real data with objective metrics and visual examples. We demonstrate that we reduce noise, and, in particular we solve the problem of noise generated by the lack of energy balance. Data are provided to the community in an image database for further research.","authors":["Pierre-Jean Lapray","Jean Baptiste Thomas","Pierre Gouton"],"meta":["June 2017Sensors 17(6):1281","DOI:10.3390/s17061281","Project: MultiSpectral Filter Array"],"references":["317443548_Illuminant_estimation_in_multispectral_imaging","317259411_HDR_Imaging_Pipeline_for_Spectral_Filter_Array_Cameras","317092229_Multispectral_Constancy_Based_on_Spectral_Adaptation_Transform","315859829_A_Database_of_Spectral_Filter_Array_Images_that_Combine_Visible_and_NIR","315526002_No-Reference_Quality_Assessment_of_Tone-Mapped_HDR_Pictures","312527167_Energy_balance_in_Spectral_Filter_Array_camera_design","308007118_Real-time_ghost_free_HDR_video_stream_generation_using_weight_adaptation_based_method","316844032_Fluorescence_hyperspectral_imaging_fHSI_using_a_spectrally_resolved_detector_array","313803863_Spatial_and_temporal_skin_blood_volume_and_saturation_estimation_using_a_multispectral_snapshot_imaging_camera","308671449_Illuminant_estimation_from_uncalibrated_multispectral_images","304617539_Spectral_Characterization_of_a_Prototype_SFA_Camera_for_Joint_Visible_and_NIR_Acquisition","301920193_Detection_of_crop_properties_by_means_of_hyperspectral_remote_sensing_from_a_micro_UAV","307965982_3D-IC_New_Perspectives_for_a_Digital_Pixel_Sensor","292346030_Fourier_Spectral_Filter_Array_For_Optimal_Multispectral_Imaging","282926066_A_tiny_VIS-NIR_snapshot_multispectral_camera"]}
