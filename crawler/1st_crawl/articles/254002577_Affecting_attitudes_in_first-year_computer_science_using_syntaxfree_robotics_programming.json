{"id":"254002577_Affecting_attitudes_in_first-year_computer_science_using_syntaxfree_robotics_programming","abstract":"Persistence of first-year students in computer science is a problem. Although there are many factors that determine whether a student can be successful in computer science, research has shown that some attrition is due to personal perception of their ability in computer science. We created a learning experience specifically designed to improve students' self-assessment of their abilities. \"Providing robotic experiences through objectbased programming\" (PREOP) is a GUI programming environment based on Alice that students use to program autonomous robot controllers. Results show that for students that rate themselves as average programmers, the modules designed around PREOP positively affect the students' intimidation levels.","authors":["Monica anderson herzog","Andrew Mckenzie","Briana Wellman","Marcus Brown"],"meta":["August 2011ACM Inroads 2(3)","DOI:10.1145/2003616.2003635"],"references":["265743569_Women_Students_in_Computer_Science_Student_Perspectives_of_Faculty_Bias_as_a_Possible_Influence_on_Student_Retention","228405788_Alice_A_3-D_tool_for_introductory_programming_concepts","224827585_The_Role_of_Deliberate_Practice_in_the_Acquisition_of_Expert_Performance","221538591_Note_to_self_make_assignments_meaningful","221537713_Measuring_the_effectiveness_of_robots_in_teaching_computer_science","220613236_Why_the_high_attrition_rate_for_computer_science_students_Some_thoughts_and_observations","4246467_No_fear_University_of_Minnesota_Robotics_Day_Camp_introduces_local_youth_to_hands-on_technologies","314794808_Measuring_the_effectiveness_of_robots_in_teaching_computer_science","289963485_The_role_of_deliberate_practice_in_the_acquistion_of_expert_performance","274970033_Note_to_self","270699572_An_unlevel_playing_field","234788119_PREOP_as_a_tool_to_increase_student_retention_in_CS","228915251_Providing_Robotic_Experiences_Through_Object-Based_Programming_PREOP","221538771_The_funnel_that_grew_our_CIS_major_in_the_CS_desert","221538271_An_unlevel_playing_field_Women_in_the_introductory_computer_science_courses","35352886_Predicting_Student_Performance_in_a_Beginning_Computer_Science_Class"]}
