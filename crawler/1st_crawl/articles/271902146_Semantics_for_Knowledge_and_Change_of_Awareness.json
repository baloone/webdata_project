{"id":"271902146_Semantics_for_Knowledge_and_Change_of_Awareness","abstract":"We examine various logics that combine knowledge, awareness, and change of awareness. An agent can become aware of propositional propositions but also of other agents or of herself. The dual operation to becoming aware, forgetting, can also be modelled. Our proposals are based on a novel notion of structural similarity that we call awareness bisimulation, the obvious notion of modal similarity for structures encoding knowledge and awareness.","authors":["Hans van Ditmarsch","Tim French"],"meta":["June 2014Journal of Logic Language and Information 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10849-014-9194-z"],"references":["268070943_Expressivity_Hierarchy_of_Languages_for_Epistemic_Awareness_Models","262235433_Action_models_for_knowledge_and_awareness","258083718_Knowledge_Awareness_and_Bisimulation","239850688_Small_Steps_in_Dynamics_of_Information","332958972_Interactive_Unawareness","294684571_Knowledge_and_Belief","265456690_Logical_questions_concerning_the_m-calculus_Interpolation_Lyndon_and_Los-Tarski","256555087_Characterizing_Finite_Kripke_Structures_in_Propositional_Temporal_Logic","254442179_Object-Based_Unawareness_Theory_and_Applications","252665566_Object-Based_Unawareness_II_Applications"]}
