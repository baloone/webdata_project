{"id":"220874004_Moses_Open_Source_Toolkit_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","abstract":"We describe an open-source toolkit for sta- tistical machine translation whose novel contributions are (a) support for linguisti- cally motivated factors, (b) confusion net- work decoding, and (c) efficient data for- mats for translation models and language models. In addition to the SMT decoder, the toolkit also includes a wide variety of tools for training, tuning and applying the system to many translation tasks.","authors":["Philipp Koehn","Hieu Hoang","Alexandra Birch","Chris Callison-Burch"],"meta":["June 2007","SourceDBLP","Conference: ACL 2007, Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, June 23-30, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic"],"references":["221013253_Factored_Translation_Models","220816913_Statistical_Phrase-Based_Translation","220816875_Efficient_Phrase-Table_Representation_for_Machine_Translation_with_Applications_to_Online_MT_and_Speech_Translation","2876877_A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Various_Statistical_Alignment_Models","240911908_Factored_Language_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","220839665_Pharaoh_A_Beam_Search_Decoder_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Models","4208266_A_new_decoder_for_spoken_language_translation_based_on_confusion_networks","2884718_Minimum_Error_Rate_Training_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation","2863295_Factored_Language_Models_and_Generalized_Parallel_Backoff","2602251_Srilm_---_An_Extensible_Language_Modeling_Toolkit"]}
