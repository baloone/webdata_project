{"id":"348323500_Quantum_variant_of_Montgomery_identity_and_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_the_mappings_of_two_variables","abstract":"In this investigation, we demonstrate the quantum version of Montgomery identity for the functions of two variables. Then we use the result to derive some new Ostrowski-type inequalities for the functions of two variables via quantum integrals. We also consider the particular cases of the key results and offer some new integral inequalities.","authors":["Muhammad Aamir Ali","Yuming Chu","HÃ¼seyin Budak","Abdullah Akkurt"],"meta":["January 2021Advances in Difference Equations 2021(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-020-03195-7"],"references":["343515523_Fractional_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_Inequalities_Associated_with_Exponentially_s_m_-Convex_Functions","343509217_Fractional_generalized_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_inequalities_for_m-convex_functions","343210987_New_Estimates_of_q_1_q_2_-Ostrowski-Type_Inequalities_within_a_Class_of_n_-Polynomial_Prevexity_of_Functions","343049408_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_Like_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions","343002326_On_New_Unified_Bounds_for_a_Family_of_Functions_via_Fractional_-Calculus_Theory","339825307_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_by_means_of_a_Green_function","336315513_New_parameterized_quantum_integral_inequalities_via_e-quasiconvexity","330905703_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Quasi-Convex_Functions","327628051_New_inequalities_of_Ostrowski_type_for_co-ordinated_s-convex_functions_via_fractional_integrals","339281527_On_q-Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_general_convex_functions"]}
