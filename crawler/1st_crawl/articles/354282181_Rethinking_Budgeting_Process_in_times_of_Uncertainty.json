{"id":"354282181_Rethinking_Budgeting_Process_in_times_of_Uncertainty","abstract":"Even in good times, most businesses find budgeting difficult. The process is frequently inefficient, with managers wasting too much time trying to stick to a budget that has been imposed on them. Creating one consistent budget to coordinate business units and track performance for a complete fiscal year is difficult when economic forecasts alter on a weekly or even daily basis. Following the standard budgeting procedure will almost certainly be ineffective. The objective of this study is to: first, it identifies the primary drivers of uncertainty that necessitate the rethinking of budgeting models. Second, it describes many budgeting models and tactics that have been advocated as being the most effective during volatile periods.","authors":["Naveen Kunnathuvalappil Hariharan"],"meta":["May 2020"],"references":["330185484_Business_Models_and_Complexity","290710279_How_to_rethink_your_business_during_uncertainty","345889603_Business_Strategy_Managing_Uncertainty_Opportunity_and_Enterprise","345709486_Budgeting_Planning_and_Forecasting_in_Uncertain_Times","315773425_Zero-Based_Budgeting","298433060_Good_Bye_Traditional_Budgeting_Hello_Rolling_Forecast_Has_The_Time_Come","274910721_Operations_Management_Strategy_and_Analysis_2nd_Edition","272094056_How_to_improve_efficiency_in_budgeting_-_The_case_of_business_intelligence_in_SMEs","261115207_Research_on_Key_Performance_Indicator_KPI_of_Business_Process","235290848_ALIGNING_MULTIPLE_TIME_HORIZONS_AND_MULTIPLE_FUNCTIONS_IN_STRATEGIC_PLANNING_AND_BUDGETING"]}
