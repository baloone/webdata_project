{"id":"339986983_Programming_without_Code_Teaching_Classics_and_Computational_Methods","abstract":"When considering what to cover in a joint class between Classics and Computer Science titled ‘Computational Methods for the Humanities’, the first and possibly most thorny question is to decide what technical skills need to be taught, and to what degree. We started by asking ourselves what the job of a humanist entails. Our answer was that humanists interpret the world; they seek the significance behind cultural and societal facts. In their work, humanists have access to vast amounts of data in multiple formats such as literature, music, historical documents, material culture, spoken accounts, and so on. The question then became, in order to take advantage of technology to do this job, does a humanist need to learn coding?","authors":["Marie-Claire Beaulieu","Anthony Bucci"],"meta":["March 2020"],"references":["330843475_Through_Faculty's_Eyes_Teaching_Threshold_Concepts_and_the_Framework","349768078_Prophets_and_Emperors_Human_and_Divine_Authority_from_Augustus_to_Theodosius","346844842_Classics_Online_at_the_Open_University_Teaching_and_Learning_With_Interactive_Resources","344886218_9_Revolting_Subjects_Empires_and_Insurrection_Ancient_and_Modern","344770536_Honor_and_Profit_Athenian_Trade_Policy_and_the_Economy_and_Society_of_Greece_415-307_BCE","342527084_The_Divine_Emperor_in_Virgil's_Aeneid_and_The_Warhammer_40K_Universe","339728905_Implementing_the_ACRL_Framework_Reflections_from_the_Field","338894607_Archaeogaming_An_Introduction_to_Archaeology_in_and_of_Video_Games","331590860_Advancing_Feminism_Online_Online_Tools_Visibility_and_Women_in_Classics","330886798_The_traffic_systems_of_Pompeii","330119239_Defining_and_teaching_information_literacy_Engaging_faculty_and_the_Framework","327949451_Traces_of_the_Old_Uses_of_the_New_The_Emergence_of_Digital_Literary_Studies","327189049_Roman_Studies_and_Digital_Resources","325675895_Law_and_order_in_ancient_athens","324971496_Are_games_effective_learning_tools_A_review_of_educational_games"]}
