{"id":"328637506_An_algorithm_for_cost_optimization_of_PMU_and_communication_infrastructure_in_WAMS","abstract":"Power system state estimation relies increasingly on PMU measurements to eﬀectively control and monitorgrowing and stressed transmission networks which are also aﬀected by transient and dynamic events. High PMUcost has motivated optimal PMU placement solutions but recent works have shown the eﬀect of communicationinfrastructure cost in PMU conﬁguration. In this paper, we present a new method for the design of Wide AreaMeasurement Systems. A topological analysis algorithm based on the Variable Neighbourhood Search heuristic isproposed and tested in several networks, including the common IEEE test networks and the 5804-bus Braziliantransmission system. Our results show the ﬂexibility, eﬀectiveness, and scalability of the proposed methodologywhen compared with recent research presented in the literature.","authors":["Marco António do R. S.
