{"id":"320263777_Viruses_as_secrets_of_life","abstract":"Introduction\nThese days we hear a lot about viruses, the agents that attack biological (cellular organisms) and non-biological objects (computers) via “vectors” or “hackers”, respectively, and cause infections. During the era of cyber weapon, the term “virus” has gone “viral’ and is used everywhere. Who was the first person who introduced the term “virus” into the computer science? I cannot go into its detail here, but the analogy is intriguing. These two “disease” agents follow completely different pathways but both play a similar role by “infecting their host”. Here, I concentrate on those that invade biological organisms, not PCs.","authors":["Nuredin Habili"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":[]}
