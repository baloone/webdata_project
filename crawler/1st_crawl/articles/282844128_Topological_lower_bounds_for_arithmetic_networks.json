{"id":"282844128_Topological_lower_bounds_for_arithmetic_networks","abstract":"We prove that the depth of any arithmetic network for deciding membership in a semialgebraic set \\({\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\) is bounded from below by\n$$c_1 \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\log ({\\rm b}(\\Sigma))}{n}} -c_2 \\log n,$$ where \\({{\\rm b}(\\Sigma)}\\) is the sum of the Betti numbers of \\({\\Sigma}\\) with respect to “ordinary” (singular) homology, and c1, c2 are some (absolute) positive constants. This result complements the similar lower bound in Montaña et al. (Appl Algebra Engrg Comm Comput 7:41–51, 1996) for locally closed semialgebraic sets in terms of the sum of Borel–Moore Betti numbers.We also prove that if \\({\\rho: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n-r}}\\) is the projection map, for some \\({r=0, \\ldots, n}\\), then the depth of any arithmetic network deciding membership in \\({\\Sigma}\\) is bounded by\n$$\\frac{c_1\\sqrt{\\log ({\\rm b}(\\rho(\\Sigma)))}}{n} - c_2 \\log n$$for some positive constants c1, c2.","authors":["Andrei Gabrielov","Nicolai Vorobjov"],"meta":["September 2017computational complexity 26(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-016-0145-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272423080_On_Topological_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees","265373640_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_and_Sub-Pfaffian_Sets","248304958_Variations_by_complexity_theorists_on_three_themes_of_Euler_Bezout_Betti_and_Poincare","225113655_Parallel_arithmetic_computations_A_survey","220537984_Lower_bounds_for_arithmetic_networks_II_Sum_of_Betti_numbers","220537719_Lower_Bounds_for_Arithmetic_Networks","220452494_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_Sets_Defined_by_Quantifier-Free_Formulae","1770548_Approximation_of_definable_sets_by_compact_families_and_upper_bounds_on_homotopy_and_homology","221590880_Decision_Tree_Complexity_and_Betti_Numbers","220574012_Decision_Tree_Complexity_and_Betti_Numbers"]}
