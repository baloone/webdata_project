{"id":"275685346_Languages_associated_with_saturated_formations_of_groups","abstract":"In a previous paper, the authors have shown that Eilenberg's variety\ntheorem can be extended to more general structures, called\nformations. In this paper, we give a general method to describe the\nlanguages corresponding to saturated formations of groups, which are\nwidely studied in group theory. We recover in this way a number of\nknown results about the languages corresponding to the classes of\nnilpotent groups, soluble groups and supersoluble groups. Our method\nalso applies to new examples, like the class of groups having a\nSylow tower.","authors":["Adolfo Ballester-Bolinches","Jean-Eric Pin","Xaro Soler-Escriv√†"],"meta":["January 2013Forum Mathematicum","DOI:10.1515/forum-2012-0161"],"references":["250112007_Languages_recognized_by_finite_supersoluble_groups","312910761_Formations_of_finite_monoids_and_formal_languages_Eilenberg's_theorem_revisited","282727978_Sur_les_langages_reconnus_par_des_groupes_nilpotents","280685075_The_elunateJ-normalizers_of_a_finite_soluble_group","267148152_Formations_of_algebraic_systems","266980129_Finite_soluble_groups","265898142_Subword_counting_and_nilpotent_groups","265697981_An_Extension_of_the_Schutzenberger_Product","257119357_On_the_equationx_tx_tq_in_categories","256270034_The_kernel_of_monoid_morphisms"]}
