{"id":"254860233_Quality_Assessment_of_Stereoscopic_Images","abstract":"Several metrics have been proposed in literature to assess the perceptual quality of two-dimensional images. However, no similar effort has been devoted to quality assessment of stereoscopic images. Therefore, in this paper, we review the different issues related to 3D visualization, and we propose a quality metric for the assessment of stereopairs using the fusion of 2D quality metrics and of the depth information. The proposed metric is evaluated using the SAMVIQ methodology for subjective assessment. Specifically, distortions deriving from coding are taken into account and the quality degradation of the stereopair is estimated by means of subjective tests.","authors":["Alexandre Benoit","Patrick Le Callet","Patrizio Campisi","R â€¦"],"meta":["December 2008EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing 2008(1)","DOI:10.1155/2008/659024"],"references":["253150665_Performance_evaluation_of_3DTV_systems","247369851_Reduce-reference_image_quality_assessment_using_a_wavelet-domain_natural_image_statistic_model","229084829_Variation_and_extrema_of_human_interpupillary_distance","298092017_3D_Videocommunication_Algorithms_Concepts_and_Real-Time_Systems_in_Human_Centred_Communication","288157666_Visual_comfort_of_binocular_and_3-D_displays","271282133_A_Case_Report_of_Manifest_Esotropia_After_Viewing_Anagryph_Stereoscopic_Movie","248213838_Effects_of_eye_dominance_in_visual_perception","241194645_Foundations_of_the_Stereoscopic_Cinema_A_Study_in_Depth","227991125_3D_TV_Broadcasting","225636510_A_Taxonomy_and_Evaluation_of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms"]}
