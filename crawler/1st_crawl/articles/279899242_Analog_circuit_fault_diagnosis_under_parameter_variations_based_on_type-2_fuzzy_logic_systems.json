In this paper, the evolution of soft fault diagnosis for analog circuits is explored, based, on a, type-2 fuzzy logic system, (T2FLS) which can handle measurement uncertainties. In order to evaluate the values of the faulty components accurately, a, type-2 fuzzy rule base is adopted, to describe the behavior of the circuit under test (CUT) both in fault and, fault-free circumstances and, to estimate the faulty element values when the measurement data, are corrupted, by white Gaussian noise. From, the experimental results, we can find that the advocated interval type-2 fuzzy logic system has succeeded, in evaluating crisp values of the faulty elements and, the performance is better than that of previous work. Furthermore, to validate the capability of the proposed, approach, the T2FLS is applied, to extract the component values of the integrated, circuit electromagnetic (ICEM) modeling.","authors":["T.-C.
