{"id":"263390493_Fault_Tolerant_Approximate_BFS_Structures","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of designing a {\\em fault-tolerant}\n$(\\alpha, \\beta)$ approximate BFS structure (or {\\em FT-ABFS structure} for\nshort), namely, a subgraph $H$ of the network $G$ such that subsequent to the\nfailure of some subset $F$ of edges or vertices, the surviving part of $H$\nstill contains an \\emph{approximate} BFS spanning tree for (the surviving part\nof) $G$, satisfying $dist(s,v,H\\setminus F) \\leq \\alpha \\cdot\ndist(s,v,G\\setminus F)+\\beta$ for every $v \\in V$. We first consider {\\em\nmultiplicative} $(\\alpha,0)$ FT-ABFS structures resilient to a failure of a\nsingle edge and present an algorithm that given an $n$-vertex unweighted\nundirected graph $G$ and a source $s$ constructs a $(3,0)$ FT-ABFS structure\nrooted at $s$ with at most $4n$ edges (improving by an $O(\\log n)$ factor on\nthe near-tight result of \\cite{BS10} for the special case of edge failures).\nAssuming at most $f$ edge failures, for constant integer $f>1$, we prove that\nthere exists a (poly-time constructible) $(3(f+1), (f+1) \\log n)$ FT-ABFS\nstructure with $O(f n)$ edges.\nWe then consider {\\em additive} $(1,\\beta)$ FT-ABFS structures. In contrast\nto the linear size of $(\\alpha,0)$ FT-ABFS structures, we show that for every\n$\\beta \\in [1, O(\\log n)]$ there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with a source\n$s$ for which any $(1,\\beta)$ FT-ABFS structure rooted at $s$ has\n$\\Omega(n^{1+\\epsilon(\\beta)})$ edges, for some function $\\epsilon(\\beta) \\in\n(0,1)$. In particular, $(1,3)$ FT-ABFS structures admit a lower bound of\n$\\Omega(n^{5/4})$ edges. Our lower bounds are complemented by an upper bound,\nshowing that there exists a poly-time algorithm that for every $n$-vertex\nunweighted undirected graph $G$ and source $s$ constructs a $(1,4)$ FT-ABFS\nstructure rooted at $s$ with at most $O(n^{4/3})$ edges.","authors":["Merav Parter","David Peleg"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973402.80","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239321680_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_in_Expected_On2_Time","235666546_Sparse_Fault-Tolerant_BFS_Trees","235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","234810199_Additive_spanners_and_a_b-spanners","322744213_f-sensitivity_distance_oracles_and_routing_schemes","286169692_New_Additive_Spanners","284684743_Extremal_problems_in_graph_theory","266961815_Fault_Tolerant_Additive_Spanners","262370723_Extremal_graphs_with_no_C_4_s_or_C_10_s","240745601_A_probabilistic_construction_of_a_dense_bipartite_graph_with_high_girth"]}
