{"id":"335135399_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Deterministic_Sorting_Algorithms_based_on_Runtime_and_Count_of_Various_Operations","abstract":"Sorting algorithms find its application in many\npractical fields of Computer Science. Efficient\nsolving of sorting problem has attracted a great deal\nof research as it optimizes other algorithms also.\nThe main factor which is taken into consideration\nwhile determining the efficiency of a sorting\nalgorithm is the time complexity. Mostly the\nexecution time of algorithms is investigated and\ncompared for analyzing time complexity. This paper\npresents a comparative analysis of deterministic\nsorting algorithms. Time complexity of six different\nalgorithms namely, Selection sort, Bubble sort,\nInsertion sort, Quicksort, Heapsort and Mergesort\nis determined in terms of number of comparisons,\nswaps and assignment operations in addition to\naverage execution time. Also, the performance of\nthese algorithms on fully and almost sorted lists was\nalso analyzed. The study indicates that determining\nthe operationâ€™s count is essential for analyzing time\ncomplexity especially when algorithms are\ntheoretically analyzed.","authors":["Reyha Verma","Jasbeer Singh"],"meta":["December 2015International Journal of Advanced Computer Research 5(21):380"],"references":["260632469_Comparison_of_Sorting_Algorithms_based_on_Input_Sequences","281606708_A_Statistical_Comparative_Study_of_Some_Sorting_Algorithms","242545061_Fundamental_of_Computer_Algorithms","234830142_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_1_Fascicle_1_MMIX_--_A_RISC_Computer_for_the_New_Millennium_Art_of_Computer_Programming","221321517_A_comparative_study_of_parallel_sort_algorithms","220692549_Introduction_to_Algorithms_3_ed"]}
