{"id":"307876047_Approximation_Resistance_from_Pairwise-Independent_Subgroups","abstract":"We show optimal (up to a constant factor) NP-hardness for a maximum constraint satisfaction problem with k variables per constraint (Max-kCSP) whenever k is larger than the domain size. This follows from our main result concerning CSPs given by a predicate: A CSP is approximation resistant if its predicate contains a subgroup that is balanced pairwise independent. Our main result is analogous to Austrin and Mosselâ€™s, bypassing their Unique-Games Conjecture assumption whenever the predicate is an abelian subgroup.\nOur main ingredient is a new gap-amplification technique inspired by XOR lemmas. Using this technique, we also improve the NP-hardness of approximating Independent-Set on bounded-degree graphs, Almost-Coloring, Label-Cover, and various other problems.","authors":["Siu On Chan"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of the ACM 63(3)","DOI:10.1145/2873054"],"references":["265422137_Circumventing_d-to-1_for_Approximation_Resistance_of_Satisfiable_Predicates_Strictly_Containing_Parity_of_Width_Four","234783217_Interactive_proofs_and_the_hardness_of_approximating_cliques","221462747_Constraint_Satisfaction_over_a_Non-Boolean_Domain_Approximation_Algorithms_and_Unique-Games_Hardness","220995272_Lower_bounds_for_adaptive_linearity_tests","321034605_Approximation_algorithm_for_non-boolean_Max-k-CSP","317837357_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","316807354_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","285991849_Multipartite_entanglement_in_XOR_games","282312000_Approximating_independent_sets_in_sparse_graphs","267189906_SDP_gaps_from_pairwise_independence","262251804_Towards_an_optimal_query_efficient_PCP","261469507_LS_Lower_Bounds_from_Pairwise_Independence","261243707_Hardness_of_Finding_Independent_Sets_in_Almost_q-Colorable_Graphs","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","247665552_SUBA_parallel_repetition_theorem","247587945_Some_optimal_inapproximabiity_results","242855762_Structured_Semidenite_Programs_and_Semialgebraic_Geometry_Methods_in_Robustness_and_Optimization","241623656_A_new_point_of_NP-hardness_for_Unique_Games_full_version","234689536_Improved_Hardness_of_Approximating_Chromatic_Number","233824386_Parameters_of_Two-Prover-One-Round_Game_and_The_Hardness_of_ConnectivityProblems","233282306_Approximability_and_proof_complexity","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","227645173_Simple_Analysis_of_Graph_Tests_for_Linearity_and_PCP","227171374_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Non-boolean_MAX_k-CSP","226733231_Derandomized_Graph_Products","226043728_Every_2-csp_Allows_Nontrivial_Approximation","225449566_Gaussian_Bounds_for_Noise_Correlation_of_Functions","225253410_Approximation_Resistant_Predicates_From_Pairwise_Independence","225105399_Beating_a_Random_Assignment","225027404_Hypercontractivity_Sum-of-Squares_Proofs_and_their_Applications","224836569_On_the_Usefulness_of_Predicates","224354145_Linear_Level_Lasserre_Lower_Bounds_for_Certain_k-CSPs","224206103_Hardness_of_Finding_Independent_Sets_in_Almost_3-Colorable_Graphs","222757593_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222470961_Optimization_Approximation_and_Complexity_Classes","222463101_Zero_Knowledge_and_the_Chromatic_Number","222257702_The_Hardness_of_Approximate_Optima_in_Lattices_Codes_and_Systems_of_Linear_Equations","221591911_Network_design_for_vertex_connectivity","221591670_Conditional_hardness_for_satisfiable_3-CSPs","221591629_Testing_juntas_nearly_optimally","221590996_Recycling_Queries_in_PCPs_and_in_Linearity_Tests_Extended_Abstract","221590714_Optimal_algorithms_and_inapproximability_results_for_every_CSP","221590685_CSP_gaps_and_reductions_in_the_Lasserre_hierarchy","221590591_How_to_Compress_Interactive_Communication","221499484_Hardness_Results_for_Coloring_3_-Colorable_3_-Uniform_Hypergraphs","221498892_Subexponential_Algorithms_for_Unique_Games_and_Related_Problems","221498887_Optimal_Long_Code_Test_with_One_Free_Bit","221462820_Satisfying_Degree-d_Equations_over_GF2n","221437569_Is_Constraint_Satisfaction_Over_Two_Variables_Always_Easy","220616954_Free_Bits_PCPs_and_Nonapproximability-Towards_Tight_Results","220994629_More_Efficient_Queries_in_PCPs_for_NP_and_Improved_Approximation_Hardness_of_Maximum_CSP","220896927_Approximating_Max_kCSP_-_Outperforming_a_Random_Assignment_with_Almost_a_Linear_Factor","220616932_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Polynomials","220467805_Perfect_Parallel_Repetition_Theorem_for_Quantum_Xor_Proof_Systems"]}
