{"id":"269076739_Anamorphoses_and_function_lattices","abstract":"The classical notion of a stack, or flat, operator on numerical functions is extended to functions on a complete lattice T. This implies to introduce cross sections of such functions, and also anamorphoses. The two theorems which characterize function operators from flat primitives, and their commutability under anamorphosis are then proved. An application to color images is presented.","authors":["Jean C.
