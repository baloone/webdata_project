{"id":"283571813_A_polygon-based_approach_for_matching_OpenStreetMap_road_networks_with_regional_transit_authority_data","abstract":"Matching road networks is an essential step for data enrichment and\ndata quality assessment, among other processes. Conventionally,\nroad networks from two datasets are matched using a line-based\napproach that checks for the similarity of properties of line segments.\nIn this article, a polygon-based approach is proposed to\nmatch the OpenStreetMap road network with authority data. The\nalgorithm first extracts urban blocks that are central elements of\nurban planning and are represented by polygons surrounded by\ntheir surrounding streets, and it then assigns road lines to edges of\nurban blocks by checking their topologies. In the matching process,\npolygons of urban blocks are matched in the first step by\nchecking for overlapping areas. In the second step, edges of a\nmatched urban block pair are further matched with each other.\nRoad lines that are assigned to the same matched pair of urban\nblock edges are then matched with each other. The computational\ncost is substantially reduced because the proposed approach\nmatches polygons instead of road lines, and thus, the process of\nmatching is accelerated. Experiments on Heidelberg and Shanghai\ndatasets show that the proposed approach achieves good and\nrobust matching results, with a precision higher than 96% and a\nF1-score better than 90%.","authors":["Hongchao Fan","Bisheng Yang","Alexander Zipf","Adam Rousell"],"meta":["September 2015International Journal of Geographical Information Science 30(4)","DOI:10.1080/13658816.2015.1100732","Projects: OSMLanduse - LULC data from VGI/OpenStreetMapOpenStreetMap Data Quality Analytics (VGI Big Spatial Data Analytics)Flexible Routing with OpenStreetMap : OpenRouteServicemap conflation"],"references":["268679265_Polygon-based_Approach_for_Extracting_Multilane_Road_from_OpenStreetMap_Urban_Road_Networks","267857078_Comparative_Spatial_Analysis_of_Positional_Accuracy_of_OpenStreetMap_and_Proprietary_Geodata","266334963_A_Comparative_Study_of_Proprietary_Geodata_and_Volunteered_Geographic_Information_for_Germany","262163378_Quality_assessment_for_building_footprints_data_on_OpenStreetMap","257028692_Assessment_of_OpenStreetMap_Data_-_A_Review","254238159_A_probabilistic_relaxation_approach_for_matching_road_networks","236278448_Mining_urban_land_use_patterns_from_volunteered_geographic_information_using_genetic_algorithms_and_artificial_neural_networks","235045357_How_Many_Volunteers_Does_it_Take_to_Map_an_Area_Well_The_Validity_of_Linus'_Law_to_Volunteered_Geographic_Information","262895664_Assessing_Data_Completeness_of_VGI_through_an_Automated_Matching_Procedure_for_Linear_Data","232876918_An_optimisation_model_for_linear_feature_matching_in_geographical_data_conflation"]}
