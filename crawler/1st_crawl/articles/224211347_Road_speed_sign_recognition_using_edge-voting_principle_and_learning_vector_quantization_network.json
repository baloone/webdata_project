{"id":"224211347_Road_speed_sign_recognition_using_edge-voting_principle_and_learning_vector_quantization_network","abstract":"This paper presents an automatic speed sign detection and recognition for providing the visual driving-assistance of speed limits awareness. To reduce the influence of digital noise caused by lighting condition and pollution, a segmentation based on pan-red color information is applied to extract the shape of speed sign. Based on the edge-phase information of a circle shape, a novel edge-voting principle is proposed for fast detecting the speed sign candidate from road scenes. The recognition of the content of speed sign is achieved through a modified learning vector quantization (LVQ) network which also verifies each candidate to eliminate nontarget blobs. Results show a high success rate and a low amount of false positives in both detection and recognition strategy under a wide variety of visual conditions.","authors":["Hsin-Han Chiang","Yen-Lin Chen","Wen-Qing Wang","Tsu-Tian Lee"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1109/COMPSYM.2010.5685511","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Symposium (ICS), 2010 International"],"references":["242316691_Volume_1_-_Findings","237250995_Travelling_Speed_and_the_Risk_of_Crash_Involvement_on_Rural_Roads","233932672_Pattern_Recognition_With_Fuzzy_Objective_Function_Algorithms","224346836_Road_sign_detection_using_eigen_colour","4152112_Color_detection_and_segmentation_for_road_and_traffic_signs","4032073_Real-time_color_segmentation_of_road_signs","3427879_Visual_Sign_Information_Extraction_and_Identification_by_Deformable_Models_for_Intelligent_Vehicles","312116340_Color_detection_and_segmentation_for_road_and_traffic_signs","270819378_The_self-organizing_map","247954395_The_principle_and_practice_of_numerical_classification","224369546_Robust_traffic_sign_shape_recognition_using_geometric_matching","222410764_Traffic_sign_recognition_and_analysis_for_intelligent_vehicles","3856501_A_sequential_ECHO_algorithm_based_on_the_integration_of_clustering_and_region_growing_techniques","3428034_Road-Sign_Detection_and_Recognition_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
