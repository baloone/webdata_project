{"id":"282556765_State_of_the_Art_of_Semantic_Web_for_Healthcare","abstract":"The ultimate goal to improve healthcare practices and the development of better biomedical products largely depends on the ability to share and link the wealth of collected medical data. The key challenge to pursue this ambitious objective is not only enabling the integration of the data spanning heterogeneous data sources and formats, but in the development of tools and standards for flexible search, data analytics and user friendly interfaces. In this paper we conduct an extensive survey on how Semantic Web is used to answer these challenges. First, we review ontology management and semantic data repositories for healthcare. Second, we conduct a survey on most representative applications and user â€“ friendly viewers for semantic healthcare data. Third, we analyze the data mining and data analytics approaches used to find useful patterns and knowledge in these data. Finally, we discuss the positive effects of this synergy between Semantic Web and healthcare processes, and we identify some of the major remaining obstacles and research challenges in this area.","authors":["Xhemal Zenuni","Bujar Raufi","Florie Ismaili","Jaumin Ajdari"],"meta":["July 2015Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 195:1990-1998","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.06.213"],"references":["267777242_Design_and_Development_of_a_Linked_Open_Data-Based_Health_Information_Representation_and_Visualization_System_Potentials_and_Preliminary_Evaluation","265198035_CardioSHARE_Web_Services_for_the_Semantic_Web","263547437_Analysis_of_Effectiveness_of_Apriori_Algorithm_in_Medical_Billing_Data_Mining","261428234_Mining_medical_data_to_identify_frequent_diseases_using_Apriori_algorithm","291294410_Patients_length_of_stay_grouping_using_the_hierarchical_clustering_algorithm","277307984_A_Gene_Selection_Approach_for_Classifying_Diseases_Based_on_Microarray_Datasets","271298477_Applying_k-Nearest_Neighbour_in_Diagnosing_Heart_Disease_Patients","261274942_Context-guided_universal_hybrid_decision_tree_for_activity_classification","261236762_Discovering_pattern_in_medical_audiology_data_with_FP-growth_algorithm","257404638_Association_rule_mining_to_detect_factors_which_contribute_to_heart_disease_in_males_and_females"]}
