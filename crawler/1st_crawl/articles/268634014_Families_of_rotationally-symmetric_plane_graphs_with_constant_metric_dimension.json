{"id":"268634014_Families_of_rotationally-symmetric_plane_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","abstract":"A family G of connected graphs is a family with constant metric dimension if dim(G) is finite and does not depend upon the choice of G in G. The metric dimension of some classes of plane graphs has been determined in [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 16, 23]. In this paper, we extend this study by considering some classes of plane graphs which are rotationally-symmetric. We prove that the metric dimension of these classes of plane graphs is finite and only two or three vertices chosen appropriately suffice to resolve all the vertices of these plane graphs.","authors":["Muhammad Imran","Syed Ahtsham ul Haq Bokhary","A.
