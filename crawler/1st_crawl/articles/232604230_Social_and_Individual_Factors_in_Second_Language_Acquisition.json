{"id":"232604230_Social_and_Individual_Factors_in_Second_Language_Acquisition","abstract":"Investigated the effects of social factors on motivational aspects of 2nd language acquisition. Indices of attitude, anxiety, motivation, personal contact with anglophones, fear of assimilation, intelligence, and achievement were obtained from 223 Grade 11 francophone students from Montreal. Results of factor analysis suggest that self-confidence with English developed through the S's opportunity for contact with members of the 2nd language community. Fear of assimilation was negatively related to the Integrative Motive factor. A possible dynamic relationship between integrative motive and self-confidence is suggested, and the implications of the influence of threat to ethnic identity are discussed.
