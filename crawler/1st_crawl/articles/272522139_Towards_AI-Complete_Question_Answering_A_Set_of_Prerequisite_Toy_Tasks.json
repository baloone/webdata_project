{"id":"272522139_Towards_AI-Complete_Question_Answering_A_Set_of_Prerequisite_Toy_Tasks","abstract":"One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that\nare applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an\nintelligent dialogue agent. To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for\nthe usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via\nquestion answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a\nsystem is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction,\ndeduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any\nsystem that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many\nexisting learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to\nclassify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and\nthen rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the\nrecently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some,\nbut not all, of the tasks.","authors":["Jason Weston","Antoine Bordes","Sumit Chopra","Alexander M.
