{"id":"306080023_Epsilon-covering_a_greedy_optimal_algorithm_for_simple_shapes","abstract":"Unions of balls are widely used shape representations. Given a shape, computing a union of balls that is both accurate in some sense and of small cardinality is thus a challenging problem. In this work, accuracy is ensured by imposing that the union of balls, called covering, is included in the shape and covers a parameterized core set (namely the erosion) of the shape. For a family of simple shapes, we propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that computes a covering of minimum cardi-nality for a given shape.","authors":["Tuong-Bach Nguyen","Isabelle Sivignon"],"meta":["August 2016","Conference: Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG)"],"references":["231181334_Adaptive_Medial-Axis_Approximation_for_Sphere-tree_Construction","314751842_Discrete_scale_axis_representations_for_3D_geometry","267137927_Geometry_of_complex_numbers_Circle_geometry_Moebius_transformation_non-Euclidean_geometry_Corr_republ_of_the_1962_orig","260801453_Greedy_Geometric_Algorithms_for_Collection_of_Balls_with_Applications_to_Geometric_Approximation_and_Molecular_Coarse-Graining","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","44259263_Discrete_Scale_Axis_Representations_for_3D_Geometry","2951490_The_Medial_Axis_of_a_Union_of_Balls"]}
