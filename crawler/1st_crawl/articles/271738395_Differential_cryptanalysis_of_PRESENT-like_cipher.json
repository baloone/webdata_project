{"id":"271738395_Differential_cryptanalysis_of_PRESENT-like_cipher","abstract":"In 2011, Borghoff et al. introduced a slender-set differential cryptanalysis on PRESENT-like ciphers with key-dependent S-boxes. Borghoffâ€™s differential attack mainly divides into two parts: data collection phase and S-box recovery phase. In this paper, we investigate different attacks on PRESENT-like cipher with secret S-boxes and public S-boxes. For PRESENT-like cipher with secret S-boxes, we introduce two new cryptanalytic techniques, and use them to recover the secret S-boxes more efficiently. Our first new idea is that we present a new method of data collection based on the method of optimal distinguisher for collecting information efficiently. Another new technique is that we propose a method of constructing the entire correct slender-sets instead of checking the correctness of slender-sets in the S-box recovery phase. In particular, we implemented a successful attack on the cipher Maya in practice. In our experiments, the correct S-boxes can be recovered with \\(2^{26}\\) data complexity and \\(2^{22.4}\\) time complexity at a success rate of 100 % based on 200 independent trials. Furthermore, we propose a new method of recovering the secret key of PRESENT-like cipher with public S-boxes with lower data and time complexity. To the 12-round PRESENT-80, the experiments show that we can recover the entire 80-bit secret key with \\(2^{34.9}\\) data and \\(2^{38.9}\\) time complexity. To the 22-round \\(\\mathrm{PRINT}_\\mathrm{CIPHER}\\) , experiments show that we can recover the entire 80-bit secret key with \\(2^{37.5}\\) data complexity and \\(2^{41.5}\\) time complexity. To the best of our knowledge, our attack is the best known differential attacks on PRESENT and \\(\\mathrm{PRINT}_\\mathrm{CIPHER}\\) in practice.","authors":["Guo-Qiang Liu","Chenhui Jin"],"meta":["April 2014Designs Codes and Cryptography 76(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-014-9965-1"],"references":["289824518_A_Model_for_Structure_Attacks_with_Applications_to_PRESENT_and_Serpent","228636632_Maya_A_novel_block_encryption_function","225835818_Multiple_Differential_Cryptanalysis_Theory_and_Practice","221354697_Cryptanalysis_of_C2","221354686_A_Chosen_Plaintext_Attack_of_the_16-round_Khufu_Cryptosystem","221291660_PRESENT_an_ultra-lightweight_block_cipher","221208266_A_Statistical_Saturation_Attack_against_the_Block_Cipher_PRESENT","220942417_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Round-Reduced_PRINTcipher_Computing_Roots_of_Permutations","220336124_Multiple_Differential_Cryptanalysis_Theory_and_Practice_Corrected","42253123_Linear_Hull_and_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Block_Cipher_PRESENT","37436855_How_Far_Can_We_Go_Beyond_Linear_Cryptanalysis","2916936_On_the_Optimality_of_Linear_Differential_and_Sequential_Distinguishers","2386882_Structural_cryptanalysis_of_SASAS","289035685_Designing_Key-Dependent_S-Boxes_Using_Hyperchaotic_Chen_System","268166120_Multiple_Differential_Cryptanalysis_Using_LLR_and_ch_2_Statistics","257333912_Slender-Set_Differential_Cryptanalysis","251413552_One_Approach_of_Using_Key-Dependent_S-BOXes_in_AES","225191797_Cryptanalysis_of_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Masking","221462132_Differential_cryptanalysis_of_reduced-round_PRESENT","221432414_Dynamic_Cellular_Automata-Based_S-Boxes","221291893_PRINTcipher_A_Block_Cipher_for_IC-Printing","221274578_Weak_keys_of_reduced-round_PRESENT_for_linear_cryptanalysis","221208240_Linear_cryptanalysis_of_reduced-round_PRESENT","220942553_Multiple_Differential_Cryptanalysis_Theory_and_Practice","220942552_Cryptanalysis_of_PRESENT-Like_Ciphers_with_Secret_S-Boxes","220942411_Multidimensional_Extension_of_Matsui's_Algorithm_2","220335182_Linear_Cryptanalysis_of_Reduced-Round_PRESENT","216301177_On_the_Problem_of_the_Most_Efficient_Tests_of_Statistical_Hypotheses","2432175_On_the_Weak_Keys_of_Blowfish"]}
