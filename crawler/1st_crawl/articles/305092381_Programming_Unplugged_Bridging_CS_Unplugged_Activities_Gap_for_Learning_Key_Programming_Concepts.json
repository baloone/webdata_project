{"id":"305092381_Programming_Unplugged_Bridging_CS_Unplugged_Activities_Gap_for_Learning_Key_Programming_Concepts","abstract":"Computer Science (CS) unplugged is a set of learning activities designed to explain CS concepts without using a computer. These activities have been used globally especially during CS outreach programs. It was used during these programs to attract middle and high school students to major in CS. With this knowledge in mind, we initiated a summer camp program involving local middle and high school girls using newly developed CS unplugged activities. The aim of these activities was to teach and simplify key programming concepts, we named these activities Programming Unplugged (PU). The set of activities developed focused on simplifying programming for newcomers. We had measured the success of the activities and the camp using surveys, and projects developed by the students. The result shows that the students have enjoyed the camp and will likely recommend it to their friends. Also, we noticed that most of the CS concepts introduced during PU activities were used in the student's projects.","authors":["Reem A. Alamer","Wejdan A. Al-Doweesh","Hend Al-Khalifa","Muna S.
