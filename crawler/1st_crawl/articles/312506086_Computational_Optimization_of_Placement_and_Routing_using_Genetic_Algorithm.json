{"id":"312506086_Computational_Optimization_of_Placement_and_Routing_using_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"In the VLSI chip designing process, Floor-planning is one of the vital stages which in turn have Placement and Routing tasks. This paper concentrates on solving the problems which occur in VLSI floor planning and gives an overview of placement and routing problems in ICs. This approach depends on recursive optimization prototypes with redefined algorithm. The searching for best solutions is carried out by Genetic Algorithm (GA) on each iteration since these algorithms is already known and proven to solve similar type of problems. GA has been tested randomly and is simulated. By conducting experiments on GA we can realize optimized solutions for the above said problems.","authors":["Hussain N Shaik","Hari Kishore Kakarla"],"meta":["December 2016Indian Journal of Science and Technology 9(47)","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2015/v8i1/104400","Project: Computational Optimization of Placement and Routing using Genetic Algorithm"],"references":[]}
