{"id":"336652665_Improving_Students'_Scientific_Writing_Ability_through_Blended_learning-Based_Collaborative_Learning","abstract":"Scientific writing is a way for someone to put the concept of thinking in written form so that other people can understand what is being thought. Students are the next generations who have idealism in thinking that needs to be nurtured. The purpose of this study was to improve the scientific writ-ing of students through Collaborative Learning by utilizing blended learn-ing technology. The research method used is action research, using collabo-rative learning that is applied in learning to write scientific paper. The stu-dents are expected to have logical thinking aspects, data objectivity, vocab-ulary mastery, use of Enhanced Spelling (EYD), use of effective sentences, and paragraph development. It can be concluded that collaborative learning can improve the ability to write scientific articles because in collaborative learning students are very active, motivated and always intrigued by their hearts and minds to solve problems faced in the same group and they can compete competitively, and motivate other students to achieve the maxi-mum learning outcomes","authors":["Dede Hasanuddin","Emzir Emzir","Sabarti Akhadiah"],"meta":["October 2019International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 14(20):34","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v14i20.11457"],"references":["329351118_Skilled_readers'_sensitivity_to_meaningful_regularities_in_English_writing","329157854_The_role_of_task_space_in_action_control_Evidence_from_research_on_instructions","321838074_Do_Similar-ability_Peers_Regulate_One_Another_in_a_Collaborative_Discourse_Activity","319094264_Learning_Analytics_in_Collaborative_Learning_Supported_By_Slack_From_the_Perspective_of_Engagement"]}
