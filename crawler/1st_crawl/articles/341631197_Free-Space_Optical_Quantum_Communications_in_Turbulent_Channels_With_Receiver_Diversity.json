{"id":"341631197_Free-Space_Optical_Quantum_Communications_in_Turbulent_Channels_With_Receiver_Diversity","abstract":"An optical quantum communication system with receiver diversity is proposed for free-space communication using the optical combining technique and a generalized Kennedy receiver. The quantum channel model of the proposed system is established using the P-representation in the presence of both turbulence and thermal noise. A conditional dynamics based Kennedy receiver with threshold detection is proposed to mitigate the influence of both turbulence and thermal noise. The error probabilities for different types of generalized Kennedy receiver, i.e., the Kennedy receiver, the Type-II receiver, and the conditional dynamics based Kennedy receiver, are analytically studied and the lower bounds for these error probabilities are obtained. Numerical results show that both the Kennedy receiver and the Type-II receiver fail in the presence of either turbulence or thermal noise. The performance of the proposed conditional dynamics based Kennedy receiver with threshold detection can surpass the standard quantum limit given by the homodyne receiver in either weak turbulence or small thermal noise.","authors":["Renzhi Yuan","Julian Cheng"],"meta":["May 2020IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2020.2997398","Project: Quantum Communications"],"references":["339344826_Closed-Form_Density_Matrices_of_Free-Space_Optical_Quantum_Communications_in_Turbulent_Channels","334801230_Optimized_communication_strategies_with_binary_coherent_states_over_phase_noise_channels","331851154_Free-Space_Optical_Quantum_BPSK_Communications_in_Turbulent_Channels","330902412_Implementation_and_security_analysis_of_practical_quantum_secure_direct_communication","318488041_Free-space_quantum_links_under_diverse_weather_conditions","308744265_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Quantum_Memory","308000805_Experimental_quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_single_photons","304271794_Measurement_device_independent_quantum_key_distribution_over_404_km_optical_fibre","236566527_Secure_direct_communication_with_a_quantum_one-time_pad","230608913_Studying_Free-Space_Transmission_Statistics_and_Improving_Free-Space_QKDin_the_Turbulent_Atmosphere","228109564_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Optical_Coherence","224112030_Performance_of_Quantum_Data_Transmission_Systems_in_the_Presence_of_Thermal_Noise","224083258_Fading_Reduction_by_Aperture_Averaging_and_Spatial_Diversity_in_Optical_Wireless_Systems","222524777_Quantum_information_with_Gaussian_states","200161734_Coherent_and_Incoherent_States_of_the_Radiation_Field","51945727_Gaussian_Quantum_Information","45851673_Discrimination_of_Optical_Coherent_States_using_a_Photon_Number_Resolving_Detector","43021470_Demonstration_of_Coherent-State_Discrimination_Using_a_Displacement-Controlled_Photon-Number-Resolving_Detector","24164132_Feasibility_of_satellite_quantum_key_distribution","23710607_Demonstration_of_Near-Optimal_Discrimination_of_Optical_Coherent_States","10948540_Grosshans_F_Assche_G_V_Wenger_J_Cerf_R_B_J_Grangier_P_Quantum_key_distribution_using_gaussian-modulated_coherent_states_Nature_421_238-241","3085066_Optimal_Detection_of_Symmetric_Mixed_Quantum_States","346677539_Optical_Coherence_and_Quantum_Optics","339923924_Kennedy_Receiver_Using_Threshold_Detection_and_Optimized_Displacement_Under_Thermal_Noise","326364665_Robust_Measurement_for_the_Discrimination_of_Binary_Coherent_States","320665039_Multi-aperture_all-fiber_active_coherent_beam_combining_for_free-space_optical_communication_receivers","318123451_Satellite-to-ground_quantum_key_distribution","314106353_Demonstration_of_free-space_optical_communication_for_long-range_data_links_between_balloons_on_Project_Loon","312829516_Quantum_Communications_Systems_with_Thermal_Noise","307435245_On_the_performance_of_downlink_optical_communication_via_relaying_in_the_presence_of_pointing_errors","303744137_Multi-aperture_digital_coherent_combining_for_free-space_optical_communication_receivers","301848541_Gaussian_Entanglement_in_the_Turbulent_Atmosphere","291176167_A_near-optimum_receiver_for_the_binary_coherent_state_quantum_channel","281685714_FSO_Detection_Using_Differential_Signaling_in_Outdoor_Correlated-Channels_Condition","279842845_Processing_and_Transmission_of_Information","279029660_Photon_number_resolution_enables_quantum_receiver_for_realistic_coherent_optical_communications","243453158_Equivalence_of_Semiclassical_and_Quantum_Mechanical_Descriptions_of_Statistical_Light_Beams","234527627_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_high-dimension_quantum_superdense_coding","232028114_Fully_Device-Independent_Quantum_Key_Distribution","226104110_Quantum_Detection_and_Estimation_Theory","220086027_Performance_Analysis_of_MIMO_Free-Space_Optical_Systems_in_Gamma-Gamma_Fading","38327805_An_operational_approach_to_quantum_probability","38011847_Near-quantum_optimum_receivers_for_the_phase-quadrature_coherent-state_channel","37407196_Optical_Detection_Theory_for_Laser_Applications","24014767_Quantum_light_in_the_turbulent_atmosphere","23630431_Statistical_decision_theory_for_quantum_systems","6399859_Optical_coherent_state_discrimination_using_a_closed-loop_quantum_measurement","3160755_Free-space_optical_communication_through_atmospheric_turbulence_channels","3083981_A_generalization_of_the_near-optimum_binary_coherent_state_receiver_concept_Corresp","2992365_Quantum-mechanical_communication_theory","1893462_Discrimination_of_the_binary_coherent_signal_Gaussian-operation_limit_and_simple_non-Gaussian_near-optimal_receivers","2193364_Distinguishing_between_optical_coherent_states_with_imperfect_detection"]}
