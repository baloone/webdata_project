{"id":"236326036_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Piecewise_Testable_and_Unambiguous_Languages","abstract":"Separation is a classical problem asking whether, given two sets belonging to\nsome class, it is possible to separate them by a set from a smaller class. We\ndiscuss the separation problem for regular languages. We give a Ptime algorithm\nto check whether two given regular languages are separable by a piecewise\ntestable language, that is, whether a $B{\\Sigma}1(<)$ sentence can witness that\nthe languages are disjoint. The proof refines an algebraic argument from\nAlmeida and the third author. When separation is possible, we also express a\nseparator by saturating one of the original languages by a suitable congruence.\nFollowing the same line, we show that one can as well decide whether two\nregular languages can be separated by an unambiguous language, albeit with a\nhigher complexity.","authors":["Thomas Place","Lorijn van Rooijen","Marc Zeitoun"],"meta":["April 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40313-2_64","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["235772028_Efficient_Separability_of_Regular_Languages_by_Subsequences_and_Suffixes","229022275_The_pseudovariety_J_is_hyperdecidable","221590153_Over_Words_Two_Variables_Are_as_Powerful_as_One_Quantifier_Alternation","221150096_Piecewise_and_Local_Threshold_Testability_of_DFA","2510507_Some_Algorithmic_Problems_for_Pseudovarieties","1892744_Aperiodic_Pointlikes_and_Beyond","283926055_Diamonds_are_forever_The_variety_DA","281263195_Inevitable_graphs_A_proof_of_the_type_II_conjecture_and_some_related_decision_procedures","278618690_An_easy_upper_bound_for_Ramsey_numbers","277023564_Deciding_definability_in_FO2hv_on_trees","263791392_INEVITABLE_GRAPHS_A_PROOF_OF_THE_TYPE_II_CONJECTURE_AND_SOME_RELATED_DECISION_PROCEDURES","242982640_Pointlike_sets_the_finest_aperiodic_cover_of_a_finite_semigroup","238286676_On_The_Profinite_Topology_on_a_Free_Group","235892242_The_separation_problem_for_regular_languages_by_piecewise_testable_languages","234787159_On_the_Decidability_of_Grammar_Problems","228961116_Pointlike_sets_with_respect_to_R_and_J","225608503_Polynomial_Closure_and_Unambiguous_Product","225516554_Sur_Le_Produit_De_Concatenation_Non_Ambigu","224174378_Deciding_Definability_in_FO_2_h_v_on_Trees","223948585_First-Order_Logic_with_Two_Variables_and_Unary_Temporal_Logic","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222352104_Factorization_forests_of_finite_height","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events","220975928_LTL_with_Past_and_Two-Way_Very-Weak_Alternating_Automata","220430814_On_the_Decidability_of_Grammar_Problems","220247696_Complexity_of_Some_Problems_from_the_Theory_of_Automata","2524950_Diamonds_Are_Forever_The_Variety_DA","2311726_The_pseudovariety_J_is_hyperdecidable"]}
