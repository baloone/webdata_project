{"id":"259288229_Relative_Upper_Confidence_Bound_for_the_K-Armed_Dueling_Bandit_Problem","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, a\nvariation on the regular K-armed bandit problem that offers only relative\nfeedback about pairs of arms. Our approach extends the Upper Confidence Bound\nalgorithm to the relative setting by using estimates of the pairwise\nprobabilities to select a promising arm and applying Upper Confidence Bound\nwith the winner as a benchmark. We prove a finite-time regret bound of order\nO(log t). In addition, our empirical results using real data from an\ninformation retrieval application show that it greatly outperforms the state of\nthe art.","authors":["Masrour Zoghi","Shimon Whiteson","Remi Munos","Maarten de Rijke"],"meta":["December 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270698287_Fidelity_Soundness_and_Efficiency_of_Interleaved_Comparison_Methods","262283795_Relative_confidence_sampling_for_efficient_on-line_ranker_evaluation","252065052_Balancing_Exploration_and_Exploitation_in_Listwise_and_Pairwise_Online_Learning_to_Rank_for_Information_Retrieval","234784921_Tailoring_click_models_to_user_goals","231582510_Kullback-Leibler_Upper_Confidence_Bounds_for_Optimal_Sequential_Allocation","229024205_X-Armed_Bandits","267562627_Improved_Algorithms_for_Linear_Stochastic_Bandits","266443561_Optimistic_Optimization_of_a_Deterministic_Function_without_the_Knowledge_of_its_Smoothness","247441127_Sample_Mean_Based_Index_Policies_with_Olog_n_Regret_for_the_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Problem","239292007_Asymptotically_efficient_adaptive_allocation_rules1"]}
