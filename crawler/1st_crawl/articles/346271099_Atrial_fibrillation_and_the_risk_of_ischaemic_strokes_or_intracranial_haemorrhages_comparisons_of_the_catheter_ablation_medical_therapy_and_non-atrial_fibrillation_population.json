We explored the IS and ICH risk after AFCA or medical therapy in the AF population and matched non-AF population.\n\nMethods and results : \nWe compared 1629 patients with AFCA (Yonsei AF ablation cohort), 3258 with medical therapy [Korean National Health Insurance (NHIS) database], and 3258 non-AF subjects (NHIS database) following a 1:2:2 propensity score matching. All AFCA patients underwent regular rhythm follow-ups for 51 Â± 29 months. Among the AFCA group, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of ISs was significantly higher in patients with sustained AF recurrences after the last ablation (0.87%) than in those remaining in sinus rhythm (0.24%, P = 0.017; log rank P = 0.003). The IRR of ISs was significantly higher in the medical therapy (1.09%) than AFCA (0.30%, P < 0.001, log rank P < 0.001 vs. medical therapy) or non-AF groups (0.34%, P < 0.001, log rank P < 0.001 vs. medical therapy; P = 0.673, log rank P = 0.874 vs. AFCA). The IRR of ICHs was 0.17% in the medical therapy, 0.06% in the AFCA (P = 0.023, log rank P = 0.042 vs. medical therapy), and 0.12% in the non-AF group (P = 0.226, log rank P = 0.241 vs. medical therapy; P = 0.172, log rank P = 0.193 vs. AFCA).\n\nConclusion : \nPost-procedural AF control influences the risk of ISs. Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation significantly reduces the risk of both ISs and ICHs to the extent of the non-AF population compared to the medical therapy.","authors":["Min Kim","Hee Tae Yu","JongYoun Kim","Tae-Hoon Kim"],"meta":["October 2020Europace 23(4)","DOI:10.1093/europace/euaa235"],"references":["338505711_Persistent_atrial_fibrillation_over_3_years_is_associated_with_higher_recurrence_after_catheter_ablation","322864086_Catheter_Ablation_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_with_Heart_Failure","320333235_2017_HRSEHRAECASAPHRSSOLAECE_expert_consensus_statement_on_catheter_and_surgical_ablation_of_atrial_fibrillation_Executive_summary","303781596_Pulmonary_vein_reconnection_predicts_good_clinical_outcome_after_second_catheter_ablation_for_atrial_fibrillation","265558131_Higher_risk_of_death_and_stroke_in_patients_with_persistent_vs_paroxysmal_atrial_fibrillation_Results_from_the_ROCKET-AF_Trial","11004010_A_Comparison_of_Rate_Control_and_Rhythm_Control_in_Patients_with_Atrial_Fibrillation","10739506_Temporal_Relations_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_and_Congestive_Heart_Failure_and_Their_Joint_Influence_on_Mortality_The_Framingham_Heart_Study","337002876_The_Electrical_Isolation_of_the_Left_Atrial_Posterior_Wall_in_Catheter_Ablation_of_Persistent_Atrial_Fibrillation","335587276_Five-Year_Change_in_the_Renal_Function_After_Catheter_Ablation_of_Atrial_Fibrillation","334150365_Atrial_Fibrillation_Catheter_Ablation_Improves_1-Year_Follow-Up_Cognitive_Function_Especially_in_Patients_With_Impaired_Cognitive_Function","333878879_Risk_of_dementia_in_stroke-free_patients_diagnosed_with_atrial_fibrillation_Data_from_a_population-based_cohort","333036906_Atrial_fibrillation_ablation_in_practice_assessing_CABANA_generalizability","331796932_Effect_of_Catheter_Ablation_vs_Antiarrhythmic_Drug_Therapy_on_Mortality_Stroke_Bleeding_and_Cardiac_Arrest_Among_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation_The_CABANA_Randomized_Clinical_Trial","330260410_Trends_and_Outcome_of_Catheter_Ablation_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_Over_9_Years_-_Focus_on_Empirical_Extra-Pulmonary_Vein_Ablation_-","325646818_CAABL-AF_California_Study_of_Ablation_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_Mortality_and_Stroke_2005_to_2013","324886674_10-year_nationwide_trends_of_the_incidence_prevalence_and_adverse_outcomes_of_non-valvular_atrial_fibrillation_nationwide_health_insurance_data_covering_the_entire_Korean_population","323136111_Stroke_and_Cardiovascular_Events_After_Ablation_or_Antiarrhythmic_Drugs_for_Treatment_of_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation","321045907_Five-year_impact_of_catheter_ablation_for_atrial_fibrillation_in_patients_with_a_prior_history_of_stroke","313545568_Catheter_ablation_of_atrial_fibrillation_is_associated_with_reduced_risk_of_stroke_and_mortality_A_propensity-matched_analysis","306140614_Delayed_recurrence_of_atrial_fibrillation_2_years_after_catheter_ablation_is_associated_with_metabolic_syndrome","299652100_Cryoballoon_or_Radiofrequency_Ablation_for_Paroxysmal_Atrial_Fibrillation","298726119_Catheter_ablation_for_atrial_fibrillation_is_associated_with_lower_incidence_of_stroke_and_death_Data_from_Swedish_health_registries","271330743_Benefit_of_Anticoagulation_Unlikely_in_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation_and_a_CHA2DS2-VASc_Score_of_1","21288750_Atrial_fibrillation_as_an_independent_risk_factor_for_stroke_The_Framingham_Study","15568504_Oral_Anticoagulants_and_Intracranial_Hemorrhage_Facts_and_Hypotheses"]}
