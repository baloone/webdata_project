{"id":"220635738_A_Survey_of_Face_Recognition_Techniques","abstract":"Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image analysis and\ncomputer vision, and as such has received a great deal of attention over the last few years because of\nits many applications in various domains. Face recognition techniques can be broadly divided into\nthree categories based on the face data acquisition methodology: methods that operate on intensity\nimages; those that deal with video sequences; and those that require other sensory data such as 3D\ninformation or infra-red imagery. In this paper, an overview of some of the well-known methods in\neach of these categories is provided and some of the benefits and drawbacks of the schemes mentioned\ntherein are examined. Furthermore, a discussion outlining the incentive for using face recognition, the\napplications of this technology, and some of the difficulties plaguing current systems with regard to\nthis task has also been provided. This paper also mentions some of the most recent algorithms\ndeveloped for this purpose and attempts to give an idea of the state of the art of face recognition\ntechnology.","authors":["Rabia Jafri","Hamid Arabnia"],"meta":["June 2009Journal of Information Processing Systems 5(2):41-68","DOI:10.3745/JIPS.2009.5.2.041","SourceDBLP"],"references":["319877813_Face_Recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","317083802_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","313752682_Face_recognition_using_eigenfaces","304425264_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","296425938_Block_LDA_for_face_recognition","290759881_Fusion_of_Face_Recognition_Algorithms_for_Video-Based_Surveillance_Systems","285599593_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","285090956_Face_Recognition_The_Problem_of_Compensating_for_Changes_in_Illumination_Direction","284035345_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_by_Locally_Linear_Embedding","272353336_Biometirics_Personal_Identifiaction_in_Networked_Society"]}
