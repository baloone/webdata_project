{"id":"317559635_Interval_orders_semiorders_and_ordered_groups","abstract":"We prove that the order of an ordered group is an interval order if and only if it is a semiorder. Next, we prove that every semiorder is isomorphic to a collection $\\mathcal J$ of intervals of some totally ordered abelian group, these intervals being of the form $[x, x+ \\alpha[$ for some positive $\\alpha$. We describe ordered groups such that the ordering is a semiorder and we introduce threshold groups generalizing totally ordered groups. We show that the free group on finitely many generators and the Thompson group $\\mathbb F$ can be equipped with a semiorder which is not a weak order. On an other hand, a group introduced by Clifford cannot.","authors":["Maurice Pouzet","Imed Zaguia"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Mathematical Psychology 89","DOI:10.1016/j.jmp.2019.01.002"],"references":["324465152_A_Dual_of_Dilworth's_Decomposition_Theorem","312631617_Interval_orders_and_shift_graphs_in_Sets_Graphs_and_Numbers","281333463_On_a_decomposition_of_relations_which_generalizes_the_sum_of_ordering_relations","268770035_A_Noncommutative_Ordinally_Simple_Linearly_Ordered_Group","268442766_Partially_ordered_groups","267132367_A_Dual_of_Dilworth's_Decomposition_Theorem","267070074_The_Mathematics_of_Preference_Choice_and_Order_Essays_in_Honor_of_Peter_C_Fishburn","246532649_Introductorary_notes_on_Richard_Thompson''s_groups","243769445_Semiorders_and_A_Theory_of_Utility_Discrimination","243050796_A_noncommutative_ordinally_simple_linearly_ordered_group"]}
