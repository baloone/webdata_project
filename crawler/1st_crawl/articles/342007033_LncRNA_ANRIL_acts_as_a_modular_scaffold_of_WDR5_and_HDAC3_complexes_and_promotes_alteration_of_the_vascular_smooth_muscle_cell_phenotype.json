In this study, we explored the role of lncRNA ANRIL in ox-LDL-induced phenotypic transition of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). The results of quantitative fluorescence PCR showed that the expression of ANRIL in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) was significantly higher than that in normal subjects. RNA-FISH detection showed that the ANRIL expression increased in HASMC treated by ox-LDL. Ox-LDL could upregulate the expression of ANRIL and ROS and promote the phenotypic transition of HASMC. After downregulation of ANRIL by siRNA, ROS level decreased and HASMC phenotypic transition alleviated. ANRIL could act as a molecular scaffold to promote the binding of WDR5 and HDAC3 to form WDR5 and HDAC3 complexes, they regulated target genes such as NOX1 expression by histone modification, upregulated ROS level and promote HASMC phenotype transition. Therefore, we found a new epigenetic regulatory mechanism for phenotype transition of VSMC, ANRIL was a treatment target of occlusive vascular diseases.","authors":["Chengxin Zhang","Shangqing Ge","Wenhui Gong","Jinguo Xu"],"meta":["June 2020Cell Death & Disease 11(6):435","DOI:10.1038/s41419-020-2645-3"],"references":["332209695_Vascular_Smooth_Muscle_Cell_Plasticity_and_Autophagy_in_Dissecting_Aortic_Aneurysms","331377090_Vascular_smooth_muscle_cell_contraction_and_relaxation_in_the_isolated_aorta_a_critical_regulator_of_large_artery_compliance","328930884_The_Histone_H3_Lysine_4_Presenter_WDR5_as_an_Oncogenic_Protein_and_Novel_Epigenetic_Target_in_Cancer","328767032_Long_Noncoding_RNA_ANRIL_Lnc-ing_Genetic_Variation_at_the_Chromosome_9p21_Locus_to_Molecular_Mechanisms_of_Atherosclerosis","327854699_Knockdown_long_non-coding_RNA_ANRIL_inhibits_proliferation_migration_and_invasion_of_HepG2_cells_by_down-regulation_of_miR-191","327169913_LncRNA_ANRIL_regulates_AML_development_through_modulating_the_glucose_metabolism_pathway_of_AdipoR1AMPKSIRT1","333252240_LncRNAs_and_epigenetic_regulation_of_vascular_endothelium_genome_positioning_system_and_regulators_of_chromatin_modifiers","330698448_Propofol_suppresses_proliferation_and_migration_of_papillary_thyroid_cancer_cells_by_down-regulation_of_lncRNA_ANRIL","328216784_Aldehyde_dehydrogenase_2_deficiency_promotes_atherosclerotic_plaque_instability_through_accelerating_mitochondrial_ROS-mediated_vascular_smooth_muscle_cell_senescence","327908763_Circular_RNAs_in_Vascular_Functions_and_Diseases_Biogenesis_and_Functions"]}
