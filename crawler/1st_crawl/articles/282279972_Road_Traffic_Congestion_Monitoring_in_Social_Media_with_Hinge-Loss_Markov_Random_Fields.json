{"id":"282279972_Road_Traffic_Congestion_Monitoring_in_Social_Media_with_Hinge-Loss_Markov_Random_Fields","abstract":"Real-time road traffic congestion monitoring is an important and challenging problem. Most existing monitoring approaches require the deployment of infrastructure sensors or large-scale probe vehicles. Their installation is often expensive and temporal-spatial coverage is limited. Probe vehicle data are oftentimes noisy on urban arterials, and therefore insufficient to provide accurate congestion estimation. This paper presents a novel social-media based approach to traffic congestion monitoring, in which pedestrians, drivers, and passengers a retreated as human sensors and their posted tweets in Twitter as observations of nearby ongoing traffic conditions. There are three technical challenges for road traffic monitoring based on Twitter, namely: 1) language ambiguity in the usage of traffic related terms, 2) uncertainty and low resolution of geographic location mentions, and 3) interactions between traffic-related events such as accidents and congestion. We propose a topic modeling based language model to address the first challenge and a collaborative inference model based on probabilistic soft logic (PSL) to address the second and third challenges. We present a unified statistical framework that combines those two models based on hinge loss Markov random fields (HLMRFs). In order to address the computational challenges incurred by the non-analytical integral of latent variables (factors) and the MAP estimation of a large number of location-dependent traffic congestion variables, we propose a fast approximate inference algorithm based on maximization expectation (ME) and the alternating directed method of multipliers (ADMM). Extensive evaluations over a variety of metrics on real world Twitter and INRIX probe speed datasets in two U.S. Major cities demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach.","authors":["Po-Ta Chen","Feng Chen","Zhen Qian"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICDM.2014.139"],"references":["272656390_Performance_and_Challenges_in_Utilizing_Non-Intrusive_Sensors_for_Traffic_Data_Collection","228439772_Event_Detection_in_Social_Streams","221589974_NewsStand_A_new_view_on_news","221309682_Parameter_Free_Bursty_Events_Detection_in_Text_Streams","221297914_Event_Detection_in_Twitter","221297852_Event_Detection_and_Tracking_in_Social_Streams","221080730_Road_traffic_congestion_detection_through_cooperative_Vehicle-to-Vehicle_communications","221023655_Geographical_Topic_Discovery_and_Comparison","221023292_Earthquake_Shakes_Twitter_Users_Real-Time_Event_Detection_by_Social_Sensors","220416607_Distributed_Optimization_and_Statistical_Learning_via_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","291737929_Event_detection_in_twitter","271560504_Traffic_congestion_detection_in_large-scale_scenarios_using_vehicle-to-vehicle_communications","265409031_Scaling_MPE_Inference_for_Constrained_Continuous_Markov_Random_Fields_with_Consensus_Optimization","262314327_Crowd_sensing_of_traffic_anomalies_based_on_human_mobility_and_social_media","236661557_Scaling_the_Indian_Buffet_Process_via_Submodular_Maximization","236368747_I_See_a_Car_Crash_Real-Time_Detection_of_Small_Scale_Incidents_in_Microblogs","236368256_The_Car_That_Hit_The_Burning_House_Understanding_Small_Scale_Incident_Related_Information_in_Microblogs","230556684_Discovering_Geographical_Topics_from_Twitter_Streams","230500432_Fast_subset_scan_for_spatial_pattern_detection","225075171_On_The_Spatiotemporal_Burstiness_of_Terms","221614315_Jasmine_A_real-time_local-event_detection_system_based_on_geolocation_information_propagated_to_microblogs","221013279_A_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Geographic_Lexical_Variation","2842034_Bursty_and_Hierarchical_Structure_in_Streams"]}
