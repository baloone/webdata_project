{"id":"335312681_Data_Transparency_with_Blockchain_and_AI_Ethics","abstract":"Providing a 360Â° view of a given data item especially for sensitive data is essential toward not only protecting the data and associated privacy but also assuring trust, compliance, and ethics of the systems that use or manage such data. With the advent of General Data Protection Regulation, California Data Privacy Law, and other such regulatory requirements, it is essential to support data transparency in all such dimensions. Moreover, data transparency should not violate privacy and security requirements. In this article, we put forward a vision for how data transparency would be achieved in a de-centralized fashion using blockchain technology.","authors":["Elisa Bertino","Ahish Kundu","Zehra Sura"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Data and Information Quality 11(4):1-8","DOI:10.1145/3312750"],"references":["220433874_A_framework_for_information_quality_assessment","331719544_Redefining_Data_Transparency_A_Multidimensional_Approach","321544437_Ethical_Reasoning_in_Big_Data_An_Exploratory_Analysis","306276984_SpaceJMP_Programming_with_Multiple_Virtual_Address_Spaces","303909406_SpaceJMP_Programming_with_Multiple_Virtual_Address_Spaces","295101323_Data_Trustworthiness-Approaches_and_Research_Challenges"]}
