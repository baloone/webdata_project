{"id":"331049571_Governance_of_artificial_intelligence_and_personal_health_information","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThis paper aims to assess the increasing challenges to governing the personal health information (PHI) essential for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning innovations in health care. Risks to privacy and justice/equity are discussed, along with potential solutions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThis conceptual paper highlights the scale and scope of PHI data consumed by deep learning algorithms and their opacity as novel challenges to health data governance.\n\nFindings\n\nThis paper argues that these characteristics of machine learning will overwhelm existing data governance approaches such as privacy regulation and informed consent. Enhanced governance techniques and tools will be required to help preserve the autonomy and rights of individuals to control their PHI. Debate among all stakeholders and informed critique of how, and for whom, PHI-fueled health AI are developed and deployed are needed to channel these innovations in societally beneficial directions.\n\nSocial implications\n\nHealth data may be used to address pressing societal concerns, such as operational and system-level improvement, and innovations such as personalized medicine. This paper informs work seeking to harness these resources for societal good amidst many competing value claims and substantial risks for privacy and security.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThis is the first paper focusing on health data governance in relation to AI/machine learning.","authors":["Jenifer Sunrise Winter","Elizabeth Davidson"],"meta":["February 2019Digital Policy Regulation and Governance 21(3)","DOI:10.1108/DPRG-08-2018-0048"],"references":["325662153_Opportunities_and_challenges_in_developing_deep_learning_models_using_electronic_health_records_data_A_systematic_review","319423215_Till_data_do_us_part_Understanding_data-based_value_creation_in_data-intensive_infrastructures","316595297_Machine_learning_with_personal_data_is_data_protection_law_smart_enough_to_meet_the_challenge","303040997_Exploring_Concordance_of_Patient-Reported_Information_on_PatientsLikeMe_and_Medical_Claims_Data_at_the_Patient_Level","289555278_How_the_machine_'thinks_Understanding_opacity_in_machine_learning_algorithms","281862395_Governance_of_algorithms_Options_and_limitations","270053399_Open_data_partnerships_between_firms_and_universities_The_role_of_boundary_organizations","267867447_Towards_critical_data_studies_Charting_and_unpacking_data_assemblages_and_their_work","266395711_P4_Medicine_How_Systems_Medicine_Will_Transform_the_Healthcare_Sector_and_Society","263776704_Big_Data_in_Health_Care_Using_Analytics_to_Identify_and_Manage_High-Risk_and_High-Cost_Patients","261221443_Clinical_research_data_warehouse_governance_for_distributed_research_networks_in_the_USA_A_systematic_review_of_the_literature","258146892_Health_data_use_stewardship_and_governance_ongoing_gaps_and_challenges_a_report_from_AMIA's_2012_Health_Policy_Meeting","51873706_A_Systematic_Review_of_Re-Identification_Attacks_on_Health_Data","46149908_Is_Deidentification_Sufficient_to_Protect_Health_Privacy_in_Research","346624964_The_Black_Box_Society_The_Secret_Algorithms_That_Control_Money_and_Information","325616041_Working_and_organizing_in_the_age_of_the_learning_algorithm","324659154_Trends_and_Trajectories_for_Explainable_Accountable_and_Intelligible_Systems_An_HCI_Research_Agenda","323983704_Big_Data's_Disparate_Impact","323865069_Health_Wearables_Ensuring_Fairness_Preventing_Discrimination_and_Promoting_Equity_in_an_Emerging_Internet-of-Things_Environment","323633048_Working_and_organizing_in_the_age_of_the_learning_algorithm","323499576_Philosophical_foundations_for_informing_the_futureS_through_IS_research","323471175_Machine_learning_and_genomics_precision_medicine_vs_patient_privacy","316843307_Deep_learning_for_healthcare_review_opportunities_and_challenges","316487963_Data_collaboratives_as_bazaars_A_review_of_coordination_problems_and_mechanisms_to_match_demand_for_data_with_supply","314379444_Balancing_Access_to_Health_Data_and_Privacy_A_Review_of_the_Issues_and_Approaches_for_the_Future","309141945_The_Googlization_of_health_research_from_disruptive_innovation_to_disruptive_ethics","301936109_NHS_data_sharing_deal_with_Google_prompts_concern","299563484_Big_data_privacy_The_datafication_of_personal_information","282871118_Building_the_foundation_for_genomics_in_precision_medicine","281822417_Machine_Learning_Trends_Perspectives_and_Prospects","281428428_Networked_Privacy","269705337_Predictive_Analytics_The_Power_to_Predict_Who_Will_Click_Buy_Lie_or_Die","263776706_The_Legal_And_Ethical_Concerns_That_Arise_From_Using_Complex_Predictive_Analytics_In_Health_Care","262771844_Big_Data_Deep_Learning_Challenges_and_Perspectives","236100614_The_Inevitable_Application_of_Big_Data_to_Health_Care","235776033_The_Economic_Value_of_Health_Care_Data","234161423_Identifying_Personal_Genomes_by_Surname_Inference","220426163_Designing_data_governance","47698381_Balancing_Access_to_Health_Data_and_Privacy_A_Review_of_the_Issues_and_Approaches_for_the_Future","47698380_Data_Governance_and_Stewardship_Designing_Data_Stewardship_Entities_and_Advancing_Data_Access","40819726_Launching_HIteCH"]}
