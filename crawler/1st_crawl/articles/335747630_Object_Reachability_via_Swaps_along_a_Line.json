{"id":"335747630_Object_Reachability_via_Swaps_along_a_Line","abstract":"The HOUSING MARKET problem is a widely studied resources allocation problem. In this problem, each agent can only receive a single object and has preferences over all objects. Starting from an initial endowment, we want to reach a certain assignment via a sequence of rational trades. We consider the problem whether an object is reachable for a given agent under a social network, where a trade between two agents is allowed if they are neighbors in the network and no participant has a deficit from the trade. Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict (no tie is allowed). This problem is polynomially solvable in a star-network and NPcomplete in a tree-network. It is left as a challenging open problem whether the problem is polynomially solvable when the network is a path. We answer this open problem positively by giving a polynomial-time algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the problem on a path will become NP-hard when the preferences of the agents are weak (ties are allowed).","authors":["Sen Huang","Mingyu Xiao"],"meta":["July 2019Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 33:2037-2044","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33012037"],"references":["275823776_The_Power_of_Swap_Deals_in_Distributed_Resource_Allocation","24091859_Kidney_Exchange","318829973_Object_Allocation_via_Swaps_along_a_Social_Network","318829711_Networked_Fairness_in_Cake_Cutting","268023965_Algorithmics_of_matching_under_preferences_With_a_foreword_by_Kurt_Mehlhorn","262286603_House_allocation_with_indifferences_A_generalization_and_a_unified_view","259506075_Top_trading_with_fixed_tie-breaking_in_markets_with_indivisible_goods","256557062_On_cores_and_indivisibility","245278541_Assignment_Using_Choice_Lists","228269564_The_Difference_Indifference_Makes_in_Strategy-Proof_Allocation_of_Objects","227444053_Assignment_Problem_Based_on_Ordinal_Preferences","221220429_Higher-Order_Matching_in_the_Linear_Lambda_Calculus_in_the_Absence_of_Constants_Is_NP-Complete","220114576_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Testing_the_Truth_of_Certain_Quantified_Boolean_Formulas","46466519_Exchange_of_indivisible_goods_and_indifferences_The_Top_Trading_Absorbing_Sets_mechanisms","4977560_House_Allocation_with_Existing_Tenants","4896293_Random_Serial_Dictatorship_and_the_Core_from_Random_Endowments_in_House_Allocation_Problems"]}
