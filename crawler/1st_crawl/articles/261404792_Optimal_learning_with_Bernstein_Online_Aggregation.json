{"id":"261404792_Optimal_learning_with_Bernstein_Online_Aggregation","abstract":"We introduce a new recursive aggregation procedure called Bernstein Online\nAggregation (BOA). The exponential weights include an accuracy term and a\nsecond order term that is a proxy of the quadratic variation as in Hazan and\nKale (2010). This second term stabilizes the procedure that is optimal in\ndifferent senses. We first obtain optimal regret bounds in the deterministic\ncontext. Then, an adaptive version is proved to solve the so-called impossible\ntuning problem already solved in Gaillard et al. (2014). The second order\nbounds in the deterministic context are extended to a general stochastic\ncontext using the cumulative predictive risk. Such conversion provides the main\nresult of the paper, an inequality of a novel type comparing the procedure with\nany deterministic aggregation procedure for an integrated criteria. It provides\nan observable confident interval on the excess of risk of the BOA procedure. To\nassert the optimality, we consider finally the iid case for strongly convex and\nLipschitz continuous losses and we prove that the rate of convergence is of the\noptimal order given in Tsybakov (2003). The batch version of the BOA procedure\nis then the first adaptive solution satisfying an optimal oracle inequality\nwith high probability.","authors":["Olivier Wintenberger"],"meta":["January 2017Machine Learning 106(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-016-5592-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260127085_A_Second-order_Bound_with_Excess_Losses","235008881_Optimal_learning_with_Q-aggregation","233281807_Prediction_of_time_series_by_statistical_learning_General_losses_and_fast_rates","290288101_Improved_Second-Order_Bounds_for_Prediction_with_Expert_Advice","281420689_Optimal_rates_of_aggregation_in_classification_under_low_noise_assumption","273005629_Second-order_Quantile_Methods_for_Experts_and_Combinatorial_Games","265630903_Statistical_learning_theory_and_stochastic_optimization_Ecole_d'Ete_de_Probabilities_de_Saint-Flour_XXXI_-_2001","260542470_The_Generalization_Ability_of_Online_Algorithms_for_Dependent_Data","245588925_Bounding_d-distance_by_information_divergence_a_method_to_prove_measure_concentration","242940846_Asymptotic_evaluation_of_certain_Markov_process_expectations_for_large_time_II","228645568_Topics_in_Non-Parametric_Statistics","226067700_Aggregation_via_empirical_risk_minimization","229494346_Asymptotic_evaluation_of_certain_Markov_process_expectations_for_large_time_IV","229430286_Weak_transport_inequalities_and_applications_to_exponential_inequalitiesand_oracle_inequalities","228934712_Stability_Bounds_for_Stationary_ph-mixing_and_b-mixing_Processes"]}
