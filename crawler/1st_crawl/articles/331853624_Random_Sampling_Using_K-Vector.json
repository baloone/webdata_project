{"id":"331853624_Random_Sampling_Using_K-Vector","abstract":"This paper introduces two new techniques for random number generation with any prescribed nonlinear distribution based on the \nk--vector methodology. The first approach is based on an inverse transform sampling using the optimal k-vector to generate the samples by inverting the cumulative distribution. The second approach generates samples by performing random searches in a pregenerated large database previously built by massive inversion of the prescribed nonlinear distribution using the k-vector. Both methods are shown to be suitable for massive generation of random samples. Examples are provided to clarify these methodologies.","authors":["David Arnas","Carl Leake","D.
