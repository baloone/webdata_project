{"id":"223008371_One-Unambiguous_Regular_Languages","abstract":"The ISO standard for the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) provides a syntactic meta-language for the definition of textual markup systems. In the standard, the right-hand sides of productions are based on regular expressions, although only regular expressions that denote words unambiguously, in the sense of the ISO standard, are allowed. In general, a word that is denoted by a regular expression is witnessed by a sequence of occurrences of symbols in the regular expression that match the word. In an unambiguous regular expression as defined by Booket al.(1971,IEEE Trans. Comput.C-20(2), 149–153), each word has at most one witness. But the SGML standard also requires that a witness be computed incrementally from the word with a one-symbol lookahead; we call such regular expressions 1-unambiguous. A regular language is a 1-unambiguouslanguage if it is denoted by some 1-unambiguous regular expression. We give a Kleene theorem for 1-unambiguous languages and characterize 1-unambiguous regular languages in terms of structural properties of the minimal deterministic automata that recognize them. As a result we are able to prove the decidability of whether a given regular expression denotes a 1-unambiguous language; if it does, then we can construct an equivalent 1-unambiguous regular expression in worst-case optimal time.","authors":["Anne Brüggemann","Derick Wood"],"meta":["May 1998Information and Computation 142(2):229-253","DOI:10.1006/inco.1997.2688","SourceDBLP"],"references":["342318085_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","228382656_Taxonomies_and_toolkits_of_regular_language_algorithms","221471248_SGML_and_Exceptions","220994412_Deterministic_Regular_Languages","2726022_Disambiguation_of_SGML_content_models","312921980_Regular_expressions_into_finite_automata","284210954_An_algorithm_for_constructing_a_base_in_a_language_of_regular_expressions","267439070_Finite_Automata","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","242529690_Automata_Languages_and_Machines","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","226520486_From_regular_expressions_to_DFA's_using_compressed_NFA's","226175848_A_new_quadratic_algorithm_to_convert_a_regular_expression_into_an_automaton","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","224001120_Compilers_principles_and_techniques_and_tools","223080680_Bracketed_context-free_languages","222471270_Local_languages_and_the_Berry-Sethi_algorithm","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","220770713_Unambiguity_of_Extended_Regular_Expressions_in_SGML_Document_Grammars","220692321_Theory_of_computation","220689816_SGML_handbook","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220618247_Fast_Pattern_Matching_in_Strings","220573910_The_Complexity_of_Restricted_Regular_Expressions_and_the_Synthesis_Problem_for_Finite_Automata","220430648_Derivatives_of_Regular_Expressions","220198120_Amounts_of_Nondeterminism_in_Finite_Automata","44127630_From_Regular_Expressions_to_Deterministic_Automata","36151359_Formal_models_in_document_processing","30867274_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms","3045618_Ambiguity_in_Graphs_and_Expressions","2631307_New_Theoretical_and_Computational_Results_For_Regular_Languages","2465763_Unambiguity_of_Extended_Regular_Expressions_in_SGML_Document_Grammars","2461397_Deterministic_Regular_Languages","2354986_From_Regular_Expressions_to_DFA's_Using_Compressed_NFA's"]}
