{"id":"305793216_The_AMSE_Lean_Six_Sigma_governance_model","abstract":"Purpose\nThe sustainability of the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) program represents the most challenging aspect for most of the organizations dealing with this methodology. In this scenario, the purpose of this paper is the description of the AMSE (which stands for Assessment, Monitoring, Sustainability, Expansion) Model, that represents a leading-edge approach to implement an effective LSS deployment on a permanent basis, by means of a structured roadmap.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe AMSE roadmap is made of four operating phases – Assessment, Monitoring, Sustainability, Expansion – it is a Model to govern the LSS deployment and to maximize both operative and economical results on a long-term basis.\n\nFindings\nOne of the main problems of LSS programs is their sustainability (sustainability of projects and the overall program) over time; the AMSE Model allows the deployment of an LSS Governance Structure with a clear definition of tasks; this model can be effectively applied both to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and global companies, regardless of the sector.\n\nPractical implications\nBoth SMEs and global corporations could benefit from applying the AMSE in terms of operational efficiency, culture improvement and people engagement.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe AMSE Model represents an innovative approach for sustaining a continuous improvement culture in the organizations over time, by defining four steps (Assessment, Monitoring, Sustainability, Expansion), divided into detailed tasks, each of which is characterized by its own specific tools.","authors":["Gabriele Arcidiacono","Nico Costantino","Kai Yang"],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Lean Six Sigma 7(3):233-266","DOI:10.1108/IJLSS-06-2015-0026"],"references":["277944542_Operating_room_adjusted_utilization_study","263418069_Linking_Six_Sigma's_critical_successhindering_factors_and_organizational_change_development_A_framework_and_a_pilot_study","257717446_The_Importance_of_Leadership_in_Driving_a_Strategic_Lean_Six_Sigma_Management","242346075_Project_selection_and_its_impact_on_the_successful_deployment_of_Six_Sigma","240259064_Hard_Facts_Dangerous_Half-Truths_and_Total_Nonsense_Profiting_from_Evidence-Based_Management","235317937_Critical_success_factors_for_the_successful_implementation_of_Six_Sigma_projects_in_organizations","234788931_Roles_Rights_and_Responsibilities_Better_Governance_Through_Decision_Rights_Automation","200552235_Critical_success_factors_for_lean_implementation_within_SMEs","355949373_The_Integration_of_Reliability_Techniques_As_an_Aid_to_the_Design_Optimisation_of_an_Earth_Moving_Machine","345973592_A_Guide_to_Lean_Six_Sigma_Management_Skills","315825365_Leading_processes_to_lead_companies_Lean_Six_Sigma","294250911_Six_sigma's_seven_deadly_sins","275110638_Six_Sigma_and_SMEs_A_critical_review_of_literature","271760790_A_Longitudinal_Assessment_of_Management_by_Objectives","269653300_Breaking_the_Code_of_Change","263417773_The_development_of_a_value_improvement_model_for_repetitive_processes_VIM_Combining_Lean_Six_Sigma_and_systems_thinking","261859289_Deploying_LSS_in_a_global_enterprise_-_project_identification","261859277_Modelling_lean_and_green_A_review_from_business_models","260411250_Lean_Six_Sigma_and_Promoting_Innovation","245507521_Expert_viewpoint_Process_improvement_projects_shortcomings_and_resolution","241702299_Lean_Six_Sigma_The_contribution_to_business_excellence","238327198_Selection_of_Six_Sigma_projects_in_the_UK","235298095_The_origins_and_development_of_quality_initiatives_in_American_business","235283018_Innovation_in_management_system_by_Six_Sigma_An_empirical_study_of_world-class_companies","235259180_Lean_production_six_sigma_quality_TQM_and_company_culture","233206199_Six_Triumphs_and_Six_Tragedies_of_Six_Sigma","230770766_TQM_as_a_management_system_consisting_of_values_techniques_and_tools","230324677_Development_of_a_FTA_versus_Parts_Count_Method_Model_Comparative_FTA","230291522_Simulated_experimental_design_used_to_define_the_characteristic_curves_of_car_shock-absorbers","227903490_Ensuring_optimal_success_with_Six_Sigma_implementations","223297870_A_systematic_methodology_for_the_creation_of_Six_Sigma_projects_A_case_study_of_semiconductor_foundry","220385458_Six_Sigma_in_industry_Some_observations_after_twenty-five_years"]}
