{"id":"277465191_Modeling_TCP_throughput","abstract":"In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCP's fast retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP's timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates.","authors":["Jitendra Padhye","Victor Firoiu","Don Towsley","Jim Kurose"],"meta":["October 1998ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 28(4):303-314","DOI:10.1145/285243.285291"],"references":["3334193_Jacobson_V_Random_Early_Detection_Gateways_for_Congestion_Avoidance_IEEEACM_Transactions_on_Networking_1_397-413","2385546_Simulation-based_comparisons_of_Tahoe_Reno_and_SACK_TCP","242642381_Tcp_friendly_unicast_rate_based_flow_control_note_sent_to_the_end2end_interest_mailing_list","3282620_Wide-Area_Internet_Traffic_Patterns_and_Characteristics","2635057_Modeling_TCP_Throughput_A_Simple_Model_and_its_Empirical_Validation"]}
