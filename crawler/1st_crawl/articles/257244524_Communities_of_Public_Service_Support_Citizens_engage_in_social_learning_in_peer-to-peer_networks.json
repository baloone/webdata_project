{"id":"257244524_Communities_of_Public_Service_Support_Citizens_engage_in_social_learning_in_peer-to-peer_networks","abstract":"New Public Management and bureaucratic models fail to acknowledge the value of peer-to-peer cooperation between citizens as a resource for public service support. Social media enable citizens to create environments for sharing information about public services in Communities of Public Service Support. The success of this model for public service support depends on the availability of communities, the level of active participation, and the information content. This paper presents an empirical study of virtual communities of expats in The Netherlands. Our analysis shows that there is a wide variety of virtual expat communities with a high level of participation and valuable content. We conclude that virtual communities play an important role in public service support since they facilitate social learning between citizens.","authors":["Albert Meijer","Stephan Grimmelikhuijsen","Gijs Jan Brandsma"],"meta":["January 2012Government Information Quarterly 29(1):21â€“29","DOI:10.1016/j.giq.2011.06.004"],"references":["248330515_Virtual_Communities_and_Social_Capital","239667645_From_a_Firm-Based_to_a_Community-Based_Model_of_Knowledge_Creation_The_Case_of_the_Linux_Kernel_Development","228599233_Shedding_light_on_lurkers_in_online_communities","8562967_Health_related_virtual_communities_and_electronic_support_groups_Systematic_review_of_the_effects_of_online_peer_to_peer_interactions","8562945_The_first_generation_of_e-patients","2605949_Developing_the_Blacksburg_Electronic_Village","329654009_The_Virtual_Community_Homesteading_on_the_Electronic_Frontier","310648839_Engaging_public_sector_clients_From_service-delivery_to_co-production","304786874_Public_Management_Reform_in_France","291787299_Digital_Government_Technology_and_Public_Sector_Performance","284687744_Health_related_virtual_communities_and_electronic_support_groups_Systematic_review_of_the_effects_of_online_peer_to_peer_interactions","279695040_The_Mutual-Aid_Self-Help_Online_Revolution","275004391_Content_Analysis_in_Mass_Communication_Assessment_and_Reporting_of_Intercoder_Reliability","263464382_Communities_of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity_CUP_Cambridge","258027597_The_Power_of_Identity","248544690_Interorganizational_collaboration_and_community_building_for_the_preservation_of_state_government_digital_information_Lessons_from_NDIIPP_state_partnership_initiative","248390464_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","242583979_Communities_Of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity","232057998_From_passive_recipient_to_active_citizen_Participation_in_mental_health_user_groups","229761865_A_Public_Management_Road_Less_Travelled_Clients_as_Co-producers_of_Public_Services","227699893_Beyond_Engagement_and_Participation_User_and_Community_Coproduction_of_Public_Services","227605219_Content_Analysis_in_Mass_Communication_Assessment_and_Reporting_of_Intercoder_Reliability","225083884_Communities_in_Cyberspace","222461571_An_analysis_of_an_electronic_support_group_for_people_with_eating_disorders","222427388_Comparing_Economic_Incentives_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","221516085_Slashdot_and_burn_Distributed_moderation_in_a_large_online_conversation_space","220691704_The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar_Musings_on_Linux_and_Open_Source_by_an_Accidental_Revolutionary","200507611_Imagined_Communities_Reflections_on_the_Origin_and_Spread_of_Nationalism","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","46712852_E-mail_in_government_Not_post-bureaucratic_but_late-bureaucratic_organizations","43524669_The_risks_and_returns_of_new_public_management","42760783_The_Virtual_Community_Homesteading_on_the_Electronic_Frontier","2535026_The_Networked_Nature_of_Community_Online_and_Offline"]}
