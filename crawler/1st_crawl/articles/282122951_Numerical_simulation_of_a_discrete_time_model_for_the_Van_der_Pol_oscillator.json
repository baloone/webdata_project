{"id":"282122951_Numerical_simulation_of_a_discrete_time_model_for_the_Van_der_Pol_oscillator","abstract":"Our objective is to build a numerical simulation of a low order dynamical system that presents a behavior similar to that of a flow featuring coupled Kelvin Helmotz and Von Karman instabilities, often encountered on wings during approach flight conditions. Then we will develop a control law architecture for that system. Such control law will be transposed to an experimental setup of a wing model equipped with trailing edge piezoactuators. Main characteristics of the flow measurement to be controlled are given in the frequency domain. Without any forcing input, its spectrum exhibits an harmonic at 200 Hz , and also subharmonics at 100 Hz and 50 Hz. Van der Pol oscillators are quite good candidates to model such phenomena because their are second order dynamical systems that present unforced oscillations and might be coupled to also exhibits subharmonics.","authors":["Valentina Motta","Philippe Mouyon"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.3897.3926"],"references":["224182681_A_new_discrete-time_model_for_a_van_del_Pol_Oscillator","274075941_Discretization_of_Nonautonomous_Nonlinear_Systems_Based_on_Continualization_of_an_Exact_Discrete-Time_Model","258951733_Digital_Control_and_Estimation_A_Unified_Approach","3445643_The_Use_of_Fast_Fourier_Transform_for_the_Estimation_of_Power_Spectra_A_Method_Based_on_Time_Averaging_Over_Short_Modified_Periodograms","3352599_Control_of_self-oscillating_systems"]}
