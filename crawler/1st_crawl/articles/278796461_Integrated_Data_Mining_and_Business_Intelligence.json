{"id":"278796461_Integrated_Data_Mining_and_Business_Intelligence","abstract":"The chapter will describe a new integrated approach to data mining by seamlessly combining business intelligence software functions with manual graphical analysis capabilities with automated data mining techniques. The integrated approach provides an analytic system that supports the KDD process in an integrated manner. Furthermore it recognizes the importance of manual analysis as an important part of the KDD process. The data mining process works cooperatively to enhance OLAP analysis and drill down allowing manual and automated approaches to be combined. It will outline both the general Data Mining process and catalogue many of the types of business intelligence tasks those are needed in any typical data mining production environment.","authors":["Sm Masfiqur Rahman","M Monzurur","Md Faisal Kabir","R Mushfiqur"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-5202-6.ch114","In book: Encyclopedia of Business Analytics and Optimization (pp.1234-1253)Chapter: 114Publisher: IGI GlobalEditors: John Wang","Project: Machine Learning Research at United International University (UIU)"],"references":["235908148_Determining_the_Necessary_Criteria_for_the_EU_Membership_by_Using_the_Machine_Learning_Method_2005_-_2010_Period_Analysis","224143338_An_agent-based_framework_for_collaborative_data_mining_optimization","313524724_Database_mining_A_performance_perspective","312463714_Knowledge_discovery_in_databases_An_overview","285872474_The_Business_Value_of_Business_Intelligence","276395022_An_open_multi-tier_architecture_for_high-performance_data_mining_using_SOA","265544297_Supervised_Machine_Learning_A_Review_of_Classification_Techniques","242787755_An_Overview_of_Service-oriented_Architecture_Web_Services_and_Grid_Computing","235720398_Providing_OLAP_On-line_Analytical_Processing_to_User-Analysts_An_IT_Mandate","234785368_Building_Data_Mining_Applications_for_CRM"]}
