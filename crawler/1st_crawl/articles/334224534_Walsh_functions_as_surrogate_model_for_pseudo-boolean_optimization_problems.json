{"id":"334224534_Walsh_functions_as_surrogate_model_for_pseudo-boolean_optimization_problems","abstract":"Surrogate-modeling is about formulating quick-to-evaluate mathematical models, to approximate black-box and time-consuming computations or simulation tasks. Although such models are well-established to solve continuous optimization problems, very few investigations regard the optimization of combinatorial structures. These structures deal for instance with binary variables, allowing each compound in the representation of a solution to be activated or not. Still, this field of research is experiencing a sudden renewed interest, bringing to the community fresh algorithmic ideas for growing these particular surrogate models. This article proposes the first surrogate-assisted optimization algorithm (WSaO) based on the mathematical foundations of discrete Walsh functions, combined with the powerful grey-box optimization techniques in order to solve pseudo-boolean optimization problems. We conduct our experiments on a benchmark of combinatorial structures and demonstrate the accuracy, and the optimization efficiency of the proposed model. We finally highlight how Walsh surrogates may outperform the state-of-the-art surrogate models for pseudo-boolean functions.","authors":["Florian LeprÃªtre","Sebastien Verel","Cyril Fonlupt","Virginie Marion"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3321707.3321800","Conference: the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference"],"references":["318067642_Optimizing_one_million_variable_NK_landscapes_by_hybridizing_deterministic_recombination_and_local_search","281329563_Experiments_on_Local_Search_for_Bi-objective_Unconstrained_Binary_Quadratic_Programming","281145153_A_Simple_Sampler_for_the_Horseshoe_Estimator","266736370_Distance_Measures_for_Permutations_in_Combinatorial_Effcient_Global_Optimization","266656419_Efficient_identification_of_improving_moves_in_a_ball_for_pseudo-boolean_problems","266656344_Efficient_global_optimization_for_combinatorial_problems","262842656_The_unconstrained_binary_quadratic_programming_problem_A_survey","257717281_A_Simulation-optimization_Approach_to_Design_Efficient_Systems_of_Bike-sharing","235709802_Efficient_Global_Optimization_of_Expensive_Black-Box_Functions","221608790_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220866947_Geometric_Generalisation_of_Surrogate_Model_Based_Optimisation_to_Combinatorial_Spaces","46588715_Adding_Transit_to_an_Agent-Based_Transportation_Simulation_Concepts_and_Implementation","2661228_Heuristic_Algorithms_for_the_Unconstrained_Binary_Quadratic_Programming_Problem","335892975_Bayesian_optimization_of_combinatorial_structures","327767128_Statistical_Learning_with_Sparsity_The_Lasso_and_Generalizations","327130010_A_Surrogate_Model_Based_on_Walsh_Decomposition_for_Pseudo-Boolean_Functions_15th_International_Conference_Coimbra_Portugal_September_8-12_2018_Proceedings_Part_II","326241524_SIALAC_benchmark_on_the_design_of_adaptive_algorithms_for_traffic_lights_problems","326240883_Simulation_optimisation_tutorial","326163788_Enhancing_partition_crossover_with_articulation_points_analysis","314921905_Traffic_Signal_Optimization_Minimizing_Travel_Time_and_Fuel_Consumption","313486875_Model-based_Methods_for_Continuous_and_Discrete_Global_Optimization","263892353_Exact_computation_of_the_expectation_surfaces_for_uniform_crossover_along_with_bit-flip_mutation","262487095_The_Origins_of_Order","245992758_Elucient_global_optimization_of_expensive_black-box_functions","237104285_A_Closed_Set_of_Normal_Orthogonal_Functions","228346610_The_Knowledge-Gradient_Algorithm_for_Sequencing_Experiments_in_Drug_Discovery","225853959_Approximations_of_pseudo-Boolean_functions_applications_to_game_theory","220514418_Surrogate-assisted_evolutionary_computation_Recent_advances_and_future_challenges","201976348_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Walsh_Functions_Part_I_A_Gentle_Introduction","11019772_Embedded_Landscapes"]}
