{"id":"339876237_Value-Set-Based_Approach_to_Robust_Stability_Analysis_for_Ellipsoidal_Families_of_Fractional-Order_Polynomials_with_Complicated_Uncertainty_Structure","abstract":"This paper presents the application of a value-set-based graphical approach to robust stability analysis for the ellipsoidal families of fractional-order polynomials with a complex structure of parametric uncertainty. More specifically, the article focuses on the families of fractional-order linear time-invariant polynomials with affine linear, multilinear, polynomic, and general uncertainty structure, combined with the uncertainty bounding set in the shape of an ellipsoid. The robust stability of these families is investigated using the zero exclusion condition, supported by the numerical computation and visualization of the value sets. Four illustrative examples are elaborated, including the comparison with the families of fractional-order polynomials having the standard box-shaped uncertainty bounding set, in order to demonstrate the applicability of this method.","authors":["Radek Matušů","Bilal Şenol","Libor Pekař"],"meta":["December 2019Applied Sciences 2019(9)","DOI:10.3390/app9245451"],"references":["335043231_Discrete-Time_First-Order_Plus_Dead-Time_Model-Reference_Trade-off_PID_Control_Design","333046622_Optimal_Robust_PID_Control_for_First-_and_Second-Order_Plus_Dead-Time_Processes","322073816_Robust_Control_Examples_Applied_to_a_Wind_Turbine_Simulated_Model","318036838_Robust_stability_of_fractional_order_polynomials_with_complicated_uncertainty_structure","346700406_Fractional-Order_Control_Systems_Fundamentals_and_Numerical_Implementations","335937344_Application_of_Value_Set_Concept_to_Ellipsoidal_Polynomial_Families_with_Multilinear_Uncertainty_Structure","332984955_Value_Sets_of_Ellipsoidal_Polynomial_Families_with_Affine_Linear_Uncertainty_Structure","323725486_Randomized_algorithms_for_analysis_and_control_of_uncertain_systems_With_applications","318448675_Robust_Stability_of_Thermal_Control_Systems_with_Uncertain_Parameters_The_Graphical_Analysis_Examples","316909196_Robust_control_under_parametric_uncertainty_An_overview_and_recent_results"]}
