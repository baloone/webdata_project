{"id":"274343540_An_in-depth_comparison_of_subgraph_isomorphism_algorithms_in_graph_databases","abstract":"Finding subgraph isomorphisms is an important problem in many applications which deal with data modeled as graphs. While this problem is NP-hard, in recent years, many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets using different join orders, pruning rules, and auxiliary neighborhood information. However, since they have not been empirically compared one another in most research work, it is not clear whether the later work outperforms the earlier work. Another problem is that reported comparisons were often done using the original authors' binaries which were written in different programming environments. In this paper, we address these serious problems by re-implementing five state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithms in a common code base and by comparing them using many real-world datasets and their query loads. Through our in-depth analysis of experimental results, we report surprising empirical findings.","authors":["Jinsoo Lee","Wook-Shin Han","Romans Kasperovics","Jeong-Hoon Lee"],"meta":["December 2012Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 6(2):133-144","DOI:10.14778/2535568.2448946"],"references":["221310199_Graph_Indexing_Tree_Delta_Graph","221215014_FG-Index_towards_verification-free_query_processing_on_graph_databases","43184477_SIGMA_A_set-cover-based_inexact_graph_matching_algorithm","4330790_TALE_A_tool_for_approximate_large_graph_matching","3193784_A_SubGraph_Isomorphism_Algorithm_for_Matching_Large_Graphs","2915152_Graph_Indexing_A_Frequent_Structure-based_Approach","2488274_Algorithmics_and_Applications_of_Tree_and_Graph_Searching","284568450_iGraph","269837853_Taming_verification_hardness","242921385_Estimating_the_Efficiency_of_Backtrack_Programs","234831436_An_Algorithm_for_Subgraph_Isomorphism","221212758_Graphs-at-a-time_Query_language_and_access_methods_for_graph_databases","221212730_Neighborhood_based_fast_graph_search_in_large_networks","221103352_GADDI_Distance_index_based_subgraph_matching_in_biological_networks","221103127_A_novel_spectral_coding_in_a_large_graph_database","220538413_iGraph_A_Framework_for_Comparisons_of_Disk-Based_Graph_Indexing_Techniques","220538341_On_Graph_Query_Optimization_in_Large_Networks","4234770_Closure-Tree_An_Index_Structure_for_Graph_Queries","3693205_Faster_Subtree_Isomorphism"]}
