{"id":"340058714_A_Belief_Rule_Based_Expert_System_to_Predict_Student_Performance_under_Uncertainty","abstract":"Student performance analysis is necessary and important for evaluating the skill and efficiency of students in different levels. To build a prospective institution, it requires continuous evaluation of the student performance as well as other Stakeholders. Due to uncertainty and other information gaps, most of the times evaluation process biased the outcomes. This paper represents an approach that can easily handle the uncertainty. In this research, applied Belief Rule Base a knowledge and Evidential Reasoning approach is applied for our evaluation. Our expert systems output is more reliable and accurate for evaluating student performance with considering personal and institutional parameters.","authors":["Sohrab Hossain","Dhiman Sarma","Fatema-Tuj- Johora","Jarin Bushra"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.1109/ICCIT48885.2019.9038564","Conference: 2019 22nd International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)"],"references":["354162712_Prediction_of_Student's_performance_using_selected_classification_methods_A_Data_mining_Approach","318681441_A_Belief_Rule_based_Expert_System_to_Diagnose_Dengue_Fever_under_Uncertainty","316561320_A_Belief_Rule_Based_Expert_System_for_Datacenter_PUE_Prediction_under_Uncertainty","289991570_A_Review_on_Predicting_Student's_Performance_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques","317723888_Student_performance_prediction_using_Support_Vector_Machine_and_K-Nearest_Neighbor","316022172_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Tracking_and_Predicting_Student_Performance_in_Degree_Programs","315809856_Analyzing_Students_performance_Using_Academic_Analytics","299222143_Predicting_learning_behaviour_of_students_Strategies_for_making_the_course_journey_interesting","287265931_A_belief_rule_based_BRB_system_to_assess_asthma_suspicion","284489479_Early_Prediction_of_Students_Performance_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques"]}
