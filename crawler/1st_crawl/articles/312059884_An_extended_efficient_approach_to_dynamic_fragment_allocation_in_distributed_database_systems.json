{"id":"312059884_An_extended_efficient_approach_to_dynamic_fragment_allocation_in_distributed_database_systems","abstract":"The distributed database better suits the real world organizations having different branches or sites at different locations. The performance of the distributed database is heavily dependent on the allocation of fragments at different sites. The main motive is to place the data fragments at different sites in such a way, so that total data transfer cost can be minimized while executing a set of queries. Moreover allocating data fragment dynamically is better than static fragment allocation. This paper proposed an extended approach to redundant and non-redundant dynamic fragment allocation in distributed database system. It additionally explains how to tackle the dynamic data fragment transfer, when more than one site simultaneously qualify for fragment allocation in redundant and nonredundant distributed database system. The comparison with other dynamic data fragment allocation approaches proved that the proposed extended approach is more capable and improves the overall system performance.","authors":["Raju Kumar","Neena Gupta"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":[]}
