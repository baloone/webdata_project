{"id":"284307866_A_New_Index_Calculus_Algorithm_with_Complexity_L14o1_in_Small_Characteristic","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for discrete logarithms in small characteristic. This algorithm is based on index calculus and includes two new contributions. The first is a new method for generating multiplicative relations among elements of a small smoothness basis. The second is a new descent strategy that allows us to express the logarithm of an arbitrary finite field element in terms of the logarithm of elements from the smoothness basis. For a small characteristic finite field of size \\(Q=p^n\\), this algorithm achieves heuristic complexity \\(L_Q(1/4+o(1)).\\) For technical reasons, unless \\(n\\) is already a composite with factors of the right size, this is done by embedding \\({\\mathbb F}_{Q}\\) in a small extension \\({\\mathbb F}_{Q^e}\\) with \\(e\\le 2\\lceil \\log _p n \\rceil \\).","authors":["Antoine Joux"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-43414-7_18","Conference: International Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography"],"references":["291377732_Solving_a_6120-bit_DLP_on_a_Desktop_Computer","291377267_On_the_Function_Field_Sieve_and_the_Impact_of_Higher_Splitting_Probabilities_Application_to_Discrete_Logarithms_in_mathbbF_21971_and_mathbbF_23164","266548913_On_the_Function_Field_Sieve_and_the_Impact_of_Higher_Splitting_Probabilities","221355610_The_Number_Field_Sieve_in_the_Medium_Prime_Case","221348594_The_Function_Field_Sieve_in_the_Medium_Prime_Case","220577577_An_algorithm_for_evaluation_of_discrete_logarithms_in_some_nonprime_finite_fields","300707071_Solving_a_6120_-bit_DLP_on_a_Desktop_Computer","281046945_Solving_multi-homogeneous_and_determinantal_systems_algorithms_complexity_applications","266860058_Faster_Index_Calculus_for_the_Medium_Prime_Case_Application_to_1175-bit_and_1425-bit_Finite_Fields","236263734_Finding_Primitive_Elements_in_Finite_Fields_of_Small_Characteristic","221451461_An_Analytic_Approach_to_Smooth_Polynominals_over_Finite_Fields","220685175_Fast_evaluation_of_logarithms_in_fields_of_characteristic_two","220482837_Grobner_Bases_of_Bihomogeneous_Ideals_Generated_by_Polynomials_of_Bidegree_11_Algorithms_and_Complexity","220248498_Function_Field_Sieve_Method_for_Discrete_Logarithms_over_Finite_Fields"]}
