{"id":"247022262_Handwriting_Issues_for_a_psychomotor_theory","abstract":"In this article it is argued that handwriting basically is a multi-component task. This implies that the production of writing strokes is the overt manifestation of divergent cognitive, psychomotor and biophysical processes. Based upon a review of elementary psychomotor findings and theoretical issues related to the cognitive structure of the skill, a possible architecture for handwriting processes is sketched. In this handwriting model each process has a characteristic unit of processing; receives its input from the operation next higher in the hierarchy; and is responsible for a specific transformation of that information to make it appropriate as an input to the next lower process. To accommodate for processing time frictions between modules, each of them is assumed to have a provision for a transient storage of output. The parallel feature of the model involves that all processors operate concurrently, but on different features of the message.","authors":["Gerard P. van Galen"],"meta":["May 1991Human Movement Science 10(2):165-191","DOI:10.1016/0167-9457(91)90003-G"],"references":["279611113_A_DESCRIPTION_OF_HANDWRITING_IN_TERMS_OF_MAIN_AXES","279453210_Movement_Analysis_of_Repetitive_Writing_Behaviour_of_First_Second_and_Third_Grade_Primary_School_Children","279435418_The_Elementary_Units_of_Programming_in_Handwriting","264457401_Time_Size_and_Shape_in_Handwriting_Exploring_Spatio-temporal_Relationships_at_Different_Levels","243748784_The_Latency_and_Duration_of_Rapid_Movement_Sequences_Comparisons_of_Speech_and_Typewriting","239065763_Normal_writing_processes_and_peripheral_acquired_dysgraphias","239059343_Motor_programs_in_rapid_speech_Additional_evidence","234771377_Computer-Aided_Analysis_of_Handwriting_Movements","228118050_Strategies_for_the_control_of_single_mechanical_degree_of_freedom_voluntary_movements_Beh_Brain_Sci_12_2_189-210","225164755_Timing_of_interresponse_intervals","312980174_Strategies_for_the_control_of_voluntary_movements_with_one_mechanical_degree_of_freedom","289778354_A_COMPUTATIONAL_MODEL_OF_CURSIVE_HANDWRITING","288491761_THE_ROLE_OF_SHORT-TERM_MEMORY_AND_THE_MOTOR_BUFFER_IN_HANDWRITING_UNDER_VISUAL_AND_NON-VISUAL_GUIDANCE","285486109_Another_decade_of_research_in_handwriting_Progress_and_prospect_in_the_1970s","285306987_A_Decade_of_Research_in_Handwriting_Progress_and_Prospect","284641559_COORDINATING_LANGUAGE_GENERATION_AND_MOTOR_CONTROL_IN_DISCOURSE_PRODUCTION_VIA_HANDWRITING","284620429_The_guiding_of_human_writing_movements","283434927_An_Analysis_Of_Children's_Penholds","282499225_Variations_in_cursive_handwriting_performance_as_a_function_of_handedness_hand_posture_and_gender","281253280_35_Handwriting_and_Drawing_A_Two_Stage_Model_of_Complex_Motor_Behavior","279721786_Invariants_in_Handwriting_The_Information_Contained_in_a_Motor_Program","279721779_Levels_of_Motor_Programming_in_Writing_Familiar_and_Unfamiliar_Symbols","279431524_On_the_Simultaneous_Processing_of_Words_Letters_and_Strokes_in_Handwriting_Evidence_For_a_Mixed_Linear_and_Parallel_Model","279427299_The_Influence_of_Changes_in_the_Effector_Coordinate_System_on_Handwriting_Movements","255953909_Programming_Sequences_of_Hand_Postures","254859278_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Handwriting","247514674_Processes_in_handwriting_A_case_for_case","247514626_Dissociation_of_spelling_errors_in_written_and_oral_spelling_The_role_of_allographic_conversion_in_writing","247514621_The_role_of_the_output_phonological_buffer_in_reading_writing_and_repetition","247403353_Response_Timing_in_Handwriting","247206595_Constancy_in_stationary_and_progressive_handwriting","247206303_The_height_of_handwriting","244503172_32_Space-Time_Invariance_in_Learned_Motor_Skills","240149549_Models_for_the_generation_of_writing_units_in_handwriting_under_variation_of_size_slant_and_orientation","233441198_Selective_writing_impairment_Beyond_the_allographic_code","232517772_Adapting_to_Processing_Demands_in_Discourse_Production_The_Case_of_Handwriting","232508385_Choosing_between_movement_sequences_A_hierarchical_editor_model","232471789_Trends_in_the_Refinement_and_Optimization_of_Fine-Motor_Trajectories_Observations_From_an_Analysis_of_the_Handwriting_of_Primary_School_Children","231926667_Are_there_independent_lexical_and_nonlexical_routes_in_word_processing_An_evaluation_of_the_dual-route_theory_of_reading","230875868_Toward_A_Cognitive-Psychology_of_Syntax_-_Information-Processing_Contributions_to_Sentence_Formulation","227081639_An_oscillation_theory_of_handwriting","225940868_Structural_complexity_of_motor_patterns_A_study_on_reaction_times_and_movement_times_of_handwritten_letters","223703163_Response_characteristics_of_prepared_and_restructured_handwriting","223487306_The_acquisition_of_coordination_Preliminary_analysis_of_learning_to_write","223475604_The_acquisition_of_typewriting_skill","223243942_Agraphia_and_micrographia_Clinical_manifestations_of_motor_programming_and_performance_disorders","223092606_The_control_of_pen_pressure_in_handwriting_A_subtle_point","222854635_The_independent_monitoring_of_form_and_scale_factors_in_handwriting","222457803_Stroke-direction_preferences_in_drawing_and_handwriting","222452381_Latencies_and_kinematics_reflect_graphic_production_rules","222441245_The_discovery_of_processing_stages_Extensions_of_Donders'_method","222388202_Programming_in_handwriting_Reaction_time_and_movement_time_as_a_function_of_sequence_length","222346854_Progressive_motion_variability_in_handwriting_tasks","222185534_Functions_of_vision_in_the_control_of_handwriting","222170011_Space-time_invariance_in_handwriting_Contrasts_between_primary_school_children_displaying_advanced_or_retarded_handwriting_acquisition"]}
