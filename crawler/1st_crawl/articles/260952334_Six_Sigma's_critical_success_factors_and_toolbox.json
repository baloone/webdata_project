{"id":"260952334_Six_Sigma's_critical_success_factors_and_toolbox","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to put forward and classify the critical success factors (CSF) of Six Sigma implementation, as well as the tools‐techniques that it utilizes in all the phases of the Define‐Measure‐Analyze‐Improve‐Control (DMAIC) structured methodology.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– A literature review of Six Sigma's CSF has been realized and also an attempt to connect them with the enablers of European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM). A literature review of the tools and techniques utilized follows and a categorization of them according to the phase of the DMAIC.\n\nFindings\n– The paper has collected a list of 32 CSF which were classified according to the five EFQM enablers, and the soft‐hard differentiation. A list of 39 tools/techniques used in the different phases of DMAIC and the ISO 13053‐1 suggestions has also been referred.\n\nOriginality/value\n– The final classifications of CSF and techniques of Six Sigma methodology could be a valuable tool for Six Sigma academics and professionals to understand and implement the methodology in the appropriate way.","authors":["Vasileios Ismyrlis","Odysseas Moschidis"],"meta":["February 2013International Journal of Lean Six Sigma 4(2):108-117","DOI:10.1108/20401461311319310"],"references":["247645761_Statistical_Thinking_Improving_Business_Performance","243461561_Six_Sigma_for_service_processes","238193459_Six_Sigma_quality_A_structured_review_and_implications_for_future_research","235317937_Critical_success_factors_for_the_successful_implementation_of_Six_Sigma_projects_in_organizations","235314780_Six_sigma_in_small-_and_medium-sized_UK_manufacturing_enterprises_Some_empirical_observations","235281472_Key_ingredients_for_the_effective_implementation_of_Six_Sigma_program","235263160_Six_sigma_in_service_organisations_Benefits_challenges_and_difficulties_common_myths_empirical_observations_and_success_factors","235254044_Six_Sigma_in_the_UK_service_organisations_Results_from_a_pilot_survey","232946930_The_evolution_of_Six_Sigma","227634233_Six_Sigma_Literature_A_Review_and_Agenda_for_Future_Research","49595060_Integration_of_EFQM_and_Ultimate_Six_Sigma_A_Proposed_Model","329702230_Quality_from_customer_needs_to_customer_Satisfaction","307632735_Six_Sigma_program_success_factors","294251430_Six_sigma_and_management","263849060_Harry_M_Schroeder_R_Six_Sigma_The_Breakthrough_Management_Strategy_Revolutionizing_the_World's_Top_Corporations_Random_House","247616452_Successful_implementation_of_Six_Sigma_Benchmarking_General_Electric_Company","247537355_Six_sigma_A_breakthrough_strategy_for_profitability","246750311_Making_Six_Sigma_Last","245527177_Implementing_Six_Sigma_in_a_non-American_culture","245495841_Six_Sigma_on_business_processes_Common_organizational_issues","239064948_Quality-from_Customer_Needs_to_Customer_Satisfaction","235319507_Employee_expectancies_for_six_sigma_success","227903490_Ensuring_optimal_success_with_Six_Sigma_implementations","222408332_The_Evolving_Theory_of_Quality_Management_The_Role_of_Six_Sigma","220672381_Six_Sigma_Concepts_tools_and_applications","13000263_Chief_Executives_Define_Their_Own_Data_Needs","3348026_A_strategy_for_survival"]}
