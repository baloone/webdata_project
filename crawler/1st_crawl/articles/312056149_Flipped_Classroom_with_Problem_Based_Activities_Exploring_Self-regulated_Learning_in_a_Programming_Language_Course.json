Problem based learning activities were carried out in flipped classrooms to promote self-regulation. A total of 30 undergraduate students from Mechatronic department participated in the study. Self-regulation skills were discussed through students' and the instructor's experiences including their opinions and behaviours. Qualitative data was collected with an observation form, discussion messages and interviews with selected participants. As a result, in terms of self-regulated learning, the goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills of the students were high in the face to face learning designed with problem based activities through flipped classroom model, their goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills were appeared moderately. In the home sessions, environment structuring, goal setting and planning skills were developed in high level while task strategies, help seeking, time management, monitoring, self-efficacy and self-evaluation skills were moderate and monitoring skills was lower. Consequently, it is hoped that the study may provide some suggestions for using problem based activities in flipped learning.","authors":["Ünal Çakıroğlu","Mücahit Öztürk"],"meta":["January 2017Educational Technology & Society 20(1):337-349"],"references":["272889075_Making_Sense_of_Video_Analytics_Lessons_Learned_from_Clickstream_Interactions_Attitudes_and_Learning_Outcome_in_a_Video-Assisted_Course","272241288_Flipping_the_Classroom_and_Student_Performance_in_Advanced_Statistics_Evidence_from_a_Quasi-Experiment","306155719_How_flippingthe_classroom_can_improve_the_traditional_lecture","298104704_How_flipping_the_classroom_can_improve_the_traditional_lecture_The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education","288347407_Evaluation_of_a_flipped_classroom_in_an_undergraduate_business_course","285683322_Upside_down_and_inside_out_Flip_your_classroom_to_improve_student_learning","283755276_From_passive_to_active_The_impact_of_the_flipped_classroom_through_social_learning_platforms_on_higher_education_students'_creative_thinking","282629575_Personalising_learning_Exploring_student_and_teacher_perceptions_about_flexible_learning_and_assessment_in_a_flipped_university_course","280758090_Motivational_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","280714111_Comparison_of_an_interactive_e-learning_preparatory_tool_and_a_conventional_downloadable_handout_used_within_a_flipped_neurologic_pharmacotherapy_lecture"]}
