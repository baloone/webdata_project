{"id":"310836116_Grill_Nano_topological_spaces_with_grill_Nano_generalized_closed_sets","abstract":"The grill Nano generalized closed sets is an expansion of Nano generalized closed sets in grill Nano topological spaces, which is the frame of reference measurement, inference and reasoning in many applications such as computer science and information systems. So, this paper aims to study and analyze this expansion through the topological structure via the concept of grill. Some important characteristics and main properties which are related with these sets are obtained.","authors":["Abdulfattah A.
