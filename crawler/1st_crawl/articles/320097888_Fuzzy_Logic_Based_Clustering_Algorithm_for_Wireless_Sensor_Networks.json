{"id":"320097888_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"WSNs have many applications in modern life. Thus, optimization of the network operation is required to maximize its lifetime. The energy is a major issue in order to increase the lifetime of WSNs. The clustering algorithm is one of the proposed algorithms to enhance the lifetime of WSNs. The operation of the clustering algorithm is divided into cluster heads (CHs) selection and cluster formation. However, most of the previous works have focused on CHs selection, and have not considered the cluster formation process, which is the important issue in clustering algorithm based routing schemes, and it can drastically affect the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, a Fuzzy Logic based Clustering Algorithm for WSN (CAFL) has been proposed to improve the lifetime of WSNs. This approach uses fuzzy logic for CHs selection and clusters formation processes by using residual energy and closeness to the sink as fuzzy inputs in terms of CH selection, and residual energy of CH and closeness to CHs as fuzzy inputs in terms of clusters formation. Simulation results justify its efficiency.","authors":["El Alami Hassan","Abdellah Najid"],"meta":["October 2017International Journal of Fuzzy System Applications 6(4):63-82","DOI:10.4018/IJFSA.2017100105","Project: Smart Energy Management and Throughput Maximization: A New Routing Protocol for WSNs"],"references":["312198518_A_Survey_of_Network_Lifetime_Maximization_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","309413843_SEFP_A_new_routing_approach_using_fuzzy_logic_for_clustered_heterogeneous_wireless_sensor_networks","308857871_SET_Smart_Energy_Management_and_Throughput_Maximization_A_New_Routing_Protocol_for_WSNs","306064484_CFFL_Cluster_formation_using_fuzzy_logic_for_wireless_sensor_networks","281307379_A_Fuzzy_Logic-Based_Clustering_Algorithm_for_WSN_to_Extend_the_Network_Lifetime","280491125_Fuzzy_Logic-Based_Cluster_Heads_Percentage_Calculation_for_Improving_the_Performance_of_the_LEACH_Protocol","228885310_SEP_A_Stable_Election_Protocol_for_Clustered_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224142135_Computational_Intelligence_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","221421173_An_Intelligent_Fuzzy-Based_Cluster_Head_Selection_System_for_WSNs_and_Its_Performance_Evaluation_for_D3N_Parameter","220948730_TEEN_ARouting_Protocol_for_Enhanced_Efficiency_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3436000_Routing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","3432618_An_Application-Specific_Protocol_Architecture_for_Wireless_Micro-Sensor_Networks","3335498_Optimal_Routing_and_Data_Aggregation_for_Maximizing_Lifetime_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","287140150_Topics_in_ad_hoc_and_sensor_networks","266176281_Improving_on_LEACH_Protocol_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Fuzzy_Logic","265772480_Mathematics_of_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Fuzzy_Logic","264724302_A_survey_on_energy_awareness_mechanisms_in_routing_protocols_for_wireless_sensor_networks_using_optimization_methods","261388813_Comparative_study_of_various_cluster_formation_algorithms_in_wireless_sensor_networks","260709382_A_Method_for_Deriving_the_Analytical_Structure_of_a_Broad_Class_of_Typical_Interval_Type-2_Mamdani_Fuzzy_Controllers","260513839_Fuzzy-Logic-Based_Clustering_Approach_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Energy_Predication","257273116_Throughput_optimization_of_a_multihop_CSMA_mobile_ad_hoc_network","238808228_Wireless_sensor_and_actor_networks_research_challenges1","224358613_Balancing_Energy_Consumption_to_Maximize_Network_Lifetime_in_Data-Gathering_Sensor_Networks","224310633_CHEF_Cluster_Head_Election_mechanism_using_Fuzzy_logic_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","222839051_Design_of_a_Distributed_Energy-efficient_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","220246043_GAMAN_A_GA_based_QoS_routing_method_for_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","4658204_Fuzzy_Logic","4143520_Cluster-head_Election_using_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3046787_Application_of_Fuzzy_Logic_to_Approximate_Reasoning_Using_Linguistic_Synthesis"]}
