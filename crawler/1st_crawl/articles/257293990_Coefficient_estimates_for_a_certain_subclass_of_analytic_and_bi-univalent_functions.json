{"id":"257293990_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce and investigate an interesting subclass HΣh,p of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk UU. For functions belonging to the class HΣh,p, we obtain estimates on the first two Taylor–Maclaurin coefficients |a2||a2| and |a3||a3|. The results presented in this paper would generalize and improve some recent work of Srivastava et al. [H.M. Srivastava, A.K. Mishra, P. Gochhayat, Certain subclasses of analytic and bi-univalent functions, Appl. Math. Lett. 23 (2010) 1188–1192].","authors":["Qing-Hua Xu","Ying-Chun Gui","Hari Mohan Srivastava"],"meta":["June 2012Applied Mathematics Letters 25(6):990–994","DOI:10.1016/j.aml.2011.11.013"],"references":["222538069_Close-to-convexity_starlikeness_and_convexity_of_certain_analytic_functions","220318170_Certain_subclasses_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","266049714_On_some_classes_of_bi-univalent_functions","265881574_Coefficient_Estimates_for_a_Class_of_Star-Like_Functions","265109585_On_a_Coefficient_Problem_for_Bi-Univalent_Functions","226085815_The_minimal_distance_of_the_image_boundary_from_the_origin_and_the_second_coefficient_of_a_univalent_function_in","222594399_Coefficient_estimates_for_certain_subclasses_of_analytic_functions_of_complex_order","222387021_Coefficient_bounds_for_some_families_of_starlike_and_convex_functions_of_complex_order","220318374_An_extension_of_the_univalent_condition_for_a_family_of_integral_operators","220317941_A_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_close-to-convex_functions","220316953_Some_applications_of_a_subordination_theorem_for_a_class_of_analytic_functions"]}
