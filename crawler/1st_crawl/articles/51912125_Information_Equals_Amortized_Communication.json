{"id":"51912125_Information_Equals_Amortized_Communication","abstract":"We show how to efficiently simulate the sending of a message M to a receiver\nwho has partial information about the message, so that the expected number of\nbits communicated in the simulation is close to the amount of additional\ninformation that the message reveals to the receiver. This is a generalization\nand strengthening of the Slepian-Wolf theorem, which shows how to carry out\nsuch a simulation with low amortized communication in the case that M is a\ndeterministic function of X. A caveat is that our simulation is interactive.\nAs a consequence, we prove that the internal information cost (namely the\ninformation revealed to the parties) involved in computing any relation or\nfunction using a two party interactive protocol is exactly equal to the\namortized communication complexity of computing independent copies of the same\nrelation or function. We also show that the only way to prove a strong direct\nsum theorem for randomized communication complexity is by solving a particular\nvariant of the pointer jumping problem that we define. Our work implies that a\nstrong direct sum theorem for communication complexity holds if and only if\nefficient compression of communication protocols is possible.","authors":["Mark Braverman","Anup Rao"],"meta":["June 2011Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on 60(10)","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2011.86","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220679095_The_communication_complexity_of_correlation","45868292_A_Strong_Direct_Product_Theorem_for_Disjointness","4257934_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlation","1956380_A_Direct_Sum_Theorem_in_Communication_Complexity_via_Message_Compression","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","262161078_Parallel_repetition_Simplifications_and_the_no-signaling_case","261268028_A_Direct_Product_Theorem_for_the_Two-Party_Bounded-Round_Public-Coin_Communication_Complexity","246047425_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_Series_in_Telecommunication","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","232633811_Amortized_communication_complexity_PDF","224324860_Communication_Requirements_for_Generating_Correlated_Random_Variables","222431754_An_Information_Statistics_Approach_to_Data_Stream_and_Communication_Complexity","221590591_How_to_Compress_Interactive_Communication","221463065_Compression_Without_a_Common_Prior_An_Information-Theoretic_Justification_for_Ambiguity_in_Language","220616444_Amortized_Communication_Complexity","220138429_Parallel_Repetition_in_Projection_Games_and_a_Concentration_Bound","220138207_Interactive_Information_Complexity","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","13988269_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","4004095_An_information_statistics_approach_to_data_stream_and_communication_complexity","3921142_Informational_Complexity_and_the_Direct_Sum_Problem_for_Simultaneous_Message_Complexity","3903190_Towards_proving_strong_direct_product_theorems","3082514_The_Common_Information_of_Two_Dependent_Random_Variables","3082237_Noiseless_coding_of_correlated_information_sources","3077657_Worst-case_interactive_communication_I_Two_messages_are_almost_optimal","2452528_Towards_Proving_Strong_Direct_Product_Theorems"]}
