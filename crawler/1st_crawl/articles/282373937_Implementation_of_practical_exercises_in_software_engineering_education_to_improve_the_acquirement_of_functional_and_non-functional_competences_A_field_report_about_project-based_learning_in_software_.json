In addition to expertise technical knowledge, graduates have to have a variety of social, methodical and personal competences. The acquirement of these non-functional competences are getting more and more important for a successful software engineer. To fulfill these requirements, it is necessarily important to prepare future professionals already during their college course of education. This paper presents exercises for a software engineering lecture with the goal to strengthen the students' practical experiences and to support the development of their non-functional competences. The developed exercises impart technical knowledge and encourage the students to improve their self-organized and lifelong learning. Thereby they are facing practical issues in all steps of the software engineering process while working on an inter semester project.","authors":["Alexander Soska","Irmgard Schroll-Decker","Juergen Mottok"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICL.2014.7017795","Project: Project EVELIN at the OTH Regensburg"],"references":["281123904_How_can_we_teach_for_meaningful_learning","267977638_Software_engineering_education_7th_SEI_CSEE_conference_San_Antonio_TX_USA_January_5-7_1994_Proceedings","239052759_Student_Perceptions_of_Tutor_Effectiveness_in_a_Problem-Based_Surgery_Clerkship","220694438_Analysis_Patterns_Reusable_Object_Models","4350205_A_Software_Factory_for_Education_in_Software_Engineering"]}
