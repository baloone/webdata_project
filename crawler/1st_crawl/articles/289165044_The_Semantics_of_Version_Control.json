{"id":"289165044_The_Semantics_of_Version_Control","abstract":"As software becomes increasingly complex, software configuration management is becoming ever more important. This paper shows how logics for reasoning about mutable state, such as separation logic, can also be used to give semantics for version control systems. By applying these ideas from the programming language research community, developers may reason formally about the broader software development process.","authors":["Wouter Swierstra","Andres LÃ¶h"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1145/2661136.2661137"],"references":["258521116_A_Categorical_Theory_of_Patches","225755584_Generic_Programming","221563014_Beauty_in_the_beast","221562944_Darcs_distributed_version_management_in_haskell","2933653_Combinators_for_Bi-Directional_Tree_Transformations_A_Linguistic_Approach_to_the_View_Update_Problem","285723183_Operational_transformation_in_real-time_group_editors_Issues_algorithms_and_achievements","266732050_Version_Control_with_Subversion","266660566_Homotopical_Patch_Theory","260648832_The_Source_Code_Control_System","248701832_Version_Control_With_Subversion","244446992_Version_management_with_CVS","242502673_Assigning_Meanings_to_Programs","242467469_Assigning_meaning_to_programs","224001273_Mercurial_The_Definitive_Guide","221558301_Local_Reasoning_about_Programs_that_Alter_Data_Structures","220695733_Exploring_generic_Haskell","220693177_Theories_of_programming_languages","213886767_Hoare_CAR_An_axiomatic_basis_for_computer_programming_Commun_ACM_12_576-580","40845930_A_functional_specification_of_effects","40219751_Making_Sense_of_Revision-Control_Systems","31771369_Pragmatic_Version_Control_Using_Subversion_M_Mason","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","2984942_Managing_Design_Data_The_Five_Dimensions_of_CAD_Frameworks_Configuration_Management_and_Product_Data_Management","2800178_Concurrent_Versions_System_A_Method_for_Independent_Cooperation","2557442_Alloy_A_Lightweight_Object_Modelling_Notation"]}
