{"id":"332655127_From_Fifth_Generation_Computing_to_Skill_Science_A_Biographical_Essay_of_Koichi_Furukawa","abstract":"Professor Koichi Furukawa, an eminent computer scientist and former Editor-in-Chief of the New Generation Computing journal, passed away on January 31, 2017. His passing was a surprise, and we were all shocked and saddened by the news. To remember the deceased, this article reviews the great career and contributions of Professor Koichi Furukawa, focusing on his research activities on the foundation and application of logic programming. Professor Furukawa had both a deep understanding and broad impact on logic programming, and he was always gentle but persistent in articulating its value across a broad spectrum of computer science and artificial intelligence research. This article introduces his research along with its insightful and unique philosophical framework.","authors":["Tomonobu Ozaki","Randy Goebel","Katsumi Inoue"],"meta":["April 2019New Generation Computing 37(2â€“3)","DOI:10.1007/s00354-019-00058-y"],"references":["275649984_On_Skill_Acquisition_Support_by_Analogical_Rule_Abduction","257618432_Completing_causal_networks_by_meta-level_abduction","248070960_Theorist_A_Logical_Reasoning_System_for_Defaults_and_Diagnosis","321066076_Special_issue_on_inductive_logic_programming","301063383_PROBLEM_SOLVING_AND_INFERENCE_MECHANISMS","272353344_Inductive_Logic_Programming","261018562_On_Skill_Acquisition_Support_by_Analogical_Rule_Abduction","250004912_Modeling_Physical_Skill_Discovery_and_Diagnosis_by_Abduction","246461557_Inductive_logic_programming_Theory_and_applications","234817687_A_Subset_of_Concurrent_Prolog_and_its_Interpreter","228768630_ProLogICA_a_practical_system_for_Abductive_Logic_Programming","234787784_A_relational_language_for_parallel_programming","226841474_A_Knowledge_Assimilation_Method_for_Logic_Data_Base","225417937_A_Computational_Model_for_Children's_Language_Acquisition_Using_Inductive_Logic_Programming","225170833_SOLAR_A_Consequence_Finding_System_for_Advanced_Reasoning"]}
