{"id":"224240975_Design_and_implementation_of_a_Byzantine_fault_tolerance_framework_for_non-deterministic_applications","abstract":"State-machine-based replication is an effective way to increase the availability and dependability of mission-critical applications. However, all practical applications contain some degree of non-determinism. Consequently, ensuring strong replica consistency in the presence of application non-determinism has been one of the biggest challenges in building dependable distributed systems. In this Study, the authors propose a classification of common types of application non-determinism with respect to the requirement of achieving Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and present the design and implementation of a BFT framework that controls these types of non-determinism in a systematic manner.","authors":["Honglei Zhang","Wenbing Zhao","Louise Moser","Peter Melliar-Smith"],"meta":["July 2011IET Software 5(3):342 - 356","DOI:10.1049/iet-sen.2010.0013","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["321606151_Delta-4_A_Generic_Architecture_for_Dependable_Distributed_Computing","301897611_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance_for_Nondeterministic_Applications","277670959_BASE","246395793_How_we_learned_to_cheat_at_online_poker_A_study_in_software_security","243443632_Fault_Tolerance_for_Distributed_and_Networked_Systems","242405734_Delta4_a_generic_architecture_for_dependable_distributed_computing","240034452_How_we_learned_to_cheat_in_online_poker","234815083_The_Weak_Byzantine_Generals_Problem","229023088_Enforcing_determinism_for_the_consistent_replication_of_multithreaded_CORBA_applications","221542150_Software_Security_Building_Security_In"]}
