{"id":"332623235_MAP_Interpolation_of_an_Ising_Image_Block","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of finding the set of MAP reconstructions of an \\(N\\times N\\) block conditioned on a boundary configuration consisting of 1 or 2 alternating runs of black and white in a uniform Ising model with no external field. It shows that when the boundary contains a single run, the set of minimum odd bond reconstructions are described by simple paths connecting the endpoints of either the black or white run. When the boundary consists of 2 runs, the set of minimum odd bond reconstructions are formed in one or more of the following ways: by simple paths connecting the endpoints of the two black runs; by simple paths connecting the two white runs; or by three simple paths connecting one of the boundary odd bonds to each of the other three. The paper provides a closed form solution for determining all minimum odd bond reconstructions for a 2-run boundary.","authors":["Matthew G. Reyes","David L. Neuhoff","Thrasyvoulos N.
