{"id":"330811451_GhoSt-NN_A_Representative_Gold_Standard_of_German_Noun-Noun_Compounds","abstract":"This paper presents a novel gold standard of German noun-noun compounds G h ost-NN including 868 compounds annotated with corpus frequencies of the compounds and their constituents, productivity and ambiguity of the constituents, semantic relations between the constituents, and compositionality ratings of compound-constituent pairs. Moreover, a subset of the compounds containing 180 compounds is balanced for the productivity of the modifiers (distinguishing low/mid/high productivity) and the ambiguity of the heads (distinguishing between heads with 1, 2 and >2 senses).","authors":["Sabine Schulte Im Walde","Anna HÃ¤tty","Stefan Bott","Nana Khvtisavrishvili"],"meta":["January 2016","Conference: LREC","Project: Compositionality and Figurative Language Usage"],"references":["330811464_Exploring_Vector_Space_Models_to_Predict_the_Compositionality_of_German_Noun-Noun_Compounds","301404693_Distinguishing_Degrees_of_Compositionality_in_Compound_Splitting_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","279181922_Using_Distributional_Similarity_of_Multi-way_Translations_to_Predict_Multiword_Expression_Compositionality","312927331_Nonparametric_statistics_for_the_Behavioral_Sciences","301404981_Better_Statistical_Machine_Translation_through_Linguistic_Treatment_of_Phrasal_Verbs","301404599_The_Impact_of_Multiword_Expression_Compositionality_on_Machine_Translation_Evaluation","270166660_The_Syntax_and_Semantics_of_Complex_Nominals","264238478_Wortbildung_der_deutschen_Gegenwartssprache","230875896_Lexical_Representation","227068153_Frequency_effects_in_the_processing_of_lexicalized_and_novel_compounds"]}
