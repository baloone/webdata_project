{"id":"321434933_A_New_Extension_of_Weibull_Distribution_Properties_and_Different_Methods_of_Estimation","abstract":"The Weibull distribution has been generalized by many authors in recent years. Here, we\nintroduce a new generalization of the Weibull distribution, called Alpha logarithmic trans-\nformed Weibull distribution that provides better fits than some of its known generalizations.\nThe proposed distribution contains Weibull, exponential, logarithmic transformed exponen-\ntial and logarithmic transformed Weibull distributions as special cases. Our main focus is\nthe estimation from frequentist point of view of the unknown parameters along with some\nmathematical properties of the new model. The proposed distribution accommodates mono-\ntonically increasing, decreasing, bathtub and unimodal and then bathtub shape hazard rates,\nso it turns out to be quite \nexible for analyzing non-negative real life data. We brie\ny de-\nscribe diï¿½erent frequentist approaches, namely, maximum likelihood estimators, percentile\nbased estimators, least squares estimators, weighted least squares estimators, maximum\nproduct of spacings estimators and compare them using extensive numerical simulations.\nMonte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the proposed meth-\nods of estimation for both small and large samples. The potentiality of the distribution is\nanalyzed by means of two real data sets.","authors":["Mazen Nassar","Ahmed Z.
