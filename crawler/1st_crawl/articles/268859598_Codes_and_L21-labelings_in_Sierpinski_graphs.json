{"id":"268859598_Codes_and_L21-labelings_in_Sierpinski_graphs","abstract":"The λ-number of a graph G is the minimum value λ such that G admits a labeling with labels from {0, 1, . . ., λ} where vertices at distance two get different labels and adjacent vertices get labels that are at least two apart. Sierpiński graphs S(n, k) generalize the Tower of Hanoi graphs - the graph S(n, 3) is isomorphic to the graph of the Tower of Hanoi with n disks. It is proved that for any n ≥ 2 and any k ≥ 3, λ(S(n, k)) = 2k. To obtain the result (perfect) codes in Sierpiński graphs are studied in detail. In particular a new proof of their (essential) uniqueness is obtained.","authors":["Sylvain Gravier","Sandi Klavžar","Michel Mollard"],"meta":["December 2005Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics 9(4)","DOI:10.11650/twjm/1500407890"],"references":["265681670_The_L21-Labeling_Problem_on_Graphs","243033265_Perfect_codes_on_the_Towers_of_Hanoi_graph","297792350_On_L21-labeling_of_the_Cartesian_product_of_a_cycle_and_a_path","285889619_Completeness_of_the_Lipscomb_space","279901620_On_distance_two_labelings_of_graphs","268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","265570772_On_the_l-number_of_Q_n_and_related_graphs","262217470_Crossing_numbers_of_Sierpinacuteski-like_graphs","243065188_Lipscomb's_LA_space_fractalized_in_Hilbert's_lsp_2A_space","243033654_1-perfect_codes_in_Sierpinski_graphs"]}
