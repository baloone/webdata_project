We use the\nexp(-Φ(ξ))-expansion method for a reliable treatment to establish exact traveling wave\nsolutions then the solitary wave solutions for the aforementioned nonlinear partial differential\nequation (NPDEs). As a result, the traveling wave solutions are obtained in four arbitrary\nfunctions including hyperbolic function solutions, trigonometric function solutions,\nexponential function solutions, and rational function solutions.","authors":["S.
