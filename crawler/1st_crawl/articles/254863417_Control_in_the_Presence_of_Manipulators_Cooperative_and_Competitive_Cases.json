{"id":"254863417_Control_in_the_Presence_of_Manipulators_Cooperative_and_Competitive_Cases","abstract":"Control and manipulation are two of the most studied types of attacks on\nelections. In this paper, we study the complexity of control attacks on\nelections in which there are manipulators. We study both the case where the\n\"chair\" who is seeking to control the election is allied with the manipulators,\nand the case where the manipulators seek to thwart the chair. In the latter\ncase, we see that the order of play substantially influences the complexity. We\nprove upper bounds, holding over every election system with a polynomial-time\nwinner problem, for all standard control cases, and some of these bounds are at\nthe second or third level of the polynomial hierarchy, and we provide matching\nlower bounds to prove these tight. Nonetheless, for important natural systems\nthe complexity can be much lower. We prove that for approval and plurality\nelections, the complexity of even competitive clashes between a controller and\nmanipulators falls far below those high bounds, even as low as polynomial time.\nYet we for a Borda-voting case show that such clashes raise the complexity\nunless NP = coNP.","authors":["Zack Fitzsimmons","Edith Hemaspaandra","Lane A.
