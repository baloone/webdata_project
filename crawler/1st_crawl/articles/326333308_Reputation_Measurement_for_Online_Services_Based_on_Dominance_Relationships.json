{"id":"326333308_Reputation_Measurement_for_Online_Services_Based_on_Dominance_Relationships","abstract":"Reputation system is an important means to build trust, aid decision making of users, and sustain user loyalty in the context of online services. However, different users inherently have different preferences, and so it is impossible that all users rate services with the same criteria. Thus, aggregating cardinal ratings into reputation will potentially lead to unreliable and misleading result, which makes the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons should be considered in reputation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation measurement mechanism that aggregates ordinal user preferences rather than cardinal ratings into reputation. By extending the majority rule naturally, dominance relationship between services is defined based on ordinal preferences. Then, reputation measurement is modelled as a problem to find a ranking that indicates the dominance relationships among services. A directed acyclic graph is constructed based on the dominance relationships of services pairs and then the ranking of services is found from the graph. We prove our method satisfies some basic criteria that a reasonable reputation measurement method should satisfy in the context of the impossibility of interpersonal utility comparisons. We also conduct a comprehensive experimental study and performance analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","authors":["Xiao-Dong Fu","Kun Yue","Li Liu","Yong Feng"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Transactions on Services Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSC.2018.2854873"],"references":["262187804_Combining_Recommender_and_Reputation_Systems_to_Produce_Better_Online_Advice","260662501_A_Novel_Method_for_Calculating_Service_Reputation","254057037_Iterative_Trust_and_Reputation_Management_Using_Belief_Propagation","251422724_Group_Recommender_Systems_New_Perspectives_in_the_Social_Web","220585995_On_Desideratum_for_B2C_E-Commerce_Reputation_Systems","220473549_RATEWeb_Reputation_Assessment_for_Trust_Establishment_among_Web_services","4298765_QoS_Consistency_as_Basis_of_Reputation_Measurement_of_Web_Service","3420073_Reputation-Oriented_Trustworthy_Computing_in_E-Commerce_Environments","324470397_Mathematical_Models_in_the_Social_Sciences","319074789_CONGRESS_A_Hybrid_Reputation_System_for_Coping_with_Rating_Subjectivity","316946126_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Ecommerce-Reputation-Escalation-as-a-Service","312312032_A_High-Reliability_Multi-Faceted_Reputation_Evaluation_Mechanism_for_Online_Services","308734912_Towards_Robust_Reputation_System_Based_on_Clustering_Approach","307572407_Evaluating_Reputation_of_Web_Services_under_Rating_Scarcity","289058349_Online_Reputation_Systems_How_to_Design_One_That_Does_What_You_Need","284540314_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","284137073_Provider_Feedback_Information_and_Customer_Choice_Decisions_on_Crowdsourcing_Marketplaces_Evidence_from_Two_Discrete_Choice_Experiments","283779886_Reputation_Measurement_and_Malicious_Feedback_Rating_Prevention_in_Web_Service_Recommendation_Systems","282564071_Efficient_Recommendation_Methods_Using_Category_Experts_for_a_Large_Dataset","276080048_Trust_and_Reputation_of_Web_Services_Through_QoS_Correlation_Lens","266370047_An_Experimental_Study_of_Reputation_with_Heterogeneous_Goods","264241703_Complexity_of_and_algorithms_for_the_manipulation_of_Borda_Nanson's_and_Baldwin's_voting_rules","256142397_The_effects_of_product_photographs_and_reputation_systems_on_consumer_behavior_and_product_cost_on_eBay","228990029_The_Beta_Reputation_System","226221888_The_computational_difficulty_of_manipulating_an_election","222412837_A_Survey_of_Trust_and_Reputation_Systems_for_Online_Service_Provision","221587358_A_Trust_and_Reputation_Model_Based_on_Bayesian_Network_for_Web_Services","221342209_A_verifiable_centralized_coercion-free_reputation_system","220196101_Systematic_analysis_of_centralized_online_reputation_systems","200110355_Rank_Aggregation_Methods_for_the_Web","31290982_The_Impossibility_of_Interpersonal_Utility_Comparisons","4082440_Reputation_fuser_ranking_compliance_verity"]}
