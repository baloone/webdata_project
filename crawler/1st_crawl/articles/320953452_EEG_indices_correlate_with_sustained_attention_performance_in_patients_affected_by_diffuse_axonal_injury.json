{"id":"320953452_EEG_indices_correlate_with_sustained_attention_performance_in_patients_affected_by_diffuse_axonal_injury","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the ability of EEG-based indices in providing relevant information about cognitive engagement level during the execution of a clinical sustained attention (SA) test in healthy volunteers and DAI (diffused axonal injury)-affected patients. We computed three continuous power-based engagement indices (Pβ/Pα, 1/Pα, and Pβ / (Pα + Pθ)) from EEG recordings in a control group (n = 7) and seven DAI-affected patients executing a 10-min Conners’ “not-X” continuous performance test (CPT). A correlation analysis was performed in order to investigate the existence of relations between the EEG metrics and behavioral parameters in both the populations. Pβ/Pα and 1/Pα indices were found to be correlated with reaction times in both groups while Pβ / (Pα + Pθ) and Pβ/Pα also correlated with the errors rate for DAI patients. In line with previous studies, time course fluctuations revealed a first strong decrease of attention after 2 min from the beginning of the test and a final fading at the end. Our results provide evidence that EEG-derived indices extraction and evaluation during SA tasks are helpful in the assessment of attention level in healthy subjects and DAI patients, offering motivations for including EEG monitoring in cognitive rehabilitation practice.

Results show a significant correlation between the time course of the indices and behavioral parameters, thus demonstrating their usefulness in monitoring mental engagement level during a sustained attention task.","authors":["Stefania Coelli","Riccardo Barbieri","Gianluigi Reni","Claudio Zucca"],"meta":["November 2017Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing 56(Pt
