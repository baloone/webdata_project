{"id":"224114705_An_architecture_for_e-voting_systems_based_on_dependable_web_services","abstract":"The explosion in the use of information technology and widespread use of the Internet makes the countries to utilize the information and communication technologies in order to get their inevitable benefits. Some of these benefits are: accuracy, speed, cost saving and etc. Election and voting is one of the cases, which is recently tended to be performed electronically. Web services, due to their advantages, may have a key role in usage and deployment of e-voting systems. However, employment of web services faces some major dependability and security issues. In this paper, an architecture for e-voting systems based on dependable web services is proposed. The proposed architecture is then modeled using stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), and the reliability and availability measures are evaluated.","authors":["Amir Omidi","Mohammad Abdollahi Azgomi"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1109/IIT.2009.5413640","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Innovations in Information Technology, 2009.
