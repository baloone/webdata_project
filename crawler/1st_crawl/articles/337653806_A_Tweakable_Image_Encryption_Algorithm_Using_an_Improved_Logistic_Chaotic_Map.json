{"id":"337653806_A_Tweakable_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Using_an_Improved_Logistic_Chaotic_Map","abstract":"This paper introduces an improved classical Logistic chaotic map that is characterized by better chaotic behaviour, this will be used to protect transmitted and stored digital images. In terms of Lyapunov exponent, bifurcation and comparison with the classical logistic map, it is observed that the improved logistic map has better chaotic performance. To test the applications of the enhanced logistic map into image encryption, a novel tweakable image encryption algorithm, which consists of a confusion-diffusion architecture has been suggested, this includes two runs of the diffusion and confusion process. The experimental results show that the scheme is simple and has good execution in image encryption and the ability to withstand several attacks.","authors":["Djamel Herbadji","Nadir Derouiche","B.
