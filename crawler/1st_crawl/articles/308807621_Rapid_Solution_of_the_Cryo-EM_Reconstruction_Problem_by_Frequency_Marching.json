{"id":"308807621_Rapid_Solution_of_the_Cryo-EM_Reconstruction_Problem_by_Frequency_Marching","abstract":"Determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins and protein complexes at atomic resolution is a fundamental task in structural biology. Over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made using \"single particle\" cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for this purpose. In cryo-EM, hundreds of thousands of two-dimensional images are obtained of individual copies of the same particle, each held in a thin sheet of ice at some unknown orientation. Each image corresponds to the noisy projection of the particle's electron-scattering density. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image from this data is typically formulated as a nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem for unknowns which encode the angular pose and lateral offset of each particle. Since there are hundreds of thousands of such parameters, this leads to a very CPU-intensive task---limiting both the number of particle images which can be processed and the number of independent reconstructions which can be carried out for the purpose of statistical validation. Here, we propose a deterministic method for high-resolution reconstruction given a very low resolution initial guess, that requires a predictable and relatively modest amount of computational effort.","authors":["Alex Barnett","Leslie Greengard","Andras Pataki","Marina Spivak"],"meta":["October 2016SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences
