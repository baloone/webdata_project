{"id":"49457599_Faster_Integer_Multiplication","abstract":"For more than 35 years, the fastest known method for integer multiplication has been the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm running in time O(n log n log log n). Under certain restrictive conditions, there is a corresponding Omega(n log n) lower bound. All this time, the prevailing conjecture has been that the complexity of an optimal integer multiplication algorithm is Theta(n log n). We take a major step towards closing the gap between the upper bound and the conjectured lower bound by presenting an algorithm running in time n log n2(O)(log* n). The running time bound holds for multitape Turing machines. The same bound is valid for the size of Boolean circuits.","authors":["Martin FÃ¼rer"],"meta":["January 2009SIAM Journal on Computing 39(3)","DOI:10.1137/070711761"],"references":["234346907_Multiplication_of_Multidigit_Numbers_on_Automata","226619489_Algorithms_for_Parallel_Memory_II_Hierarchical_Multilevel_Memories","226049108_Gauss_and_the_history_of_the_fast_Fourier_transform","37443131_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","3399594_Split_radix'_FFT_algorithm","3249547_Gauss_and_the_history_of_the_fast_Fourier_transform","2233643_Fast_Integer_Multiplication_Using_Modular_Arithmetic","1956280_Lower_Bounds_on_the_Bounded_Coefficient_Complexity_of_Bilinear_Maps","298924359_Lower_bounds_on_the_bounded_coefficient_complexity_of_bilinear_maps","266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","265952263_A_Fast_Fourier_Transform_Algorithm_Using_Base_8_Iterations","247625059_Split_radix_FFT_algorithms","238770155_The_complexity_of_a_scheme_of_functional_elements_realizing_the_multiplication_of_integers","234827471_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_for_fun_and_profit","234779678_An_economical_method_for_calculating_the_discrete_Fourier_transform","229099884_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Calculation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","227302813_Schnelle_Multiplikation_grosser_Zahlen","221521229_Asymptotically_Fast_Algorithms_for_the_Numerical_Multiplication_and_Division_of_Polynomials_with_Complex_Coeficients","220854906_Storage_Modification_Machines","220694742_Fast_algorithms_-_a_multitape_Turing_machine_implementation","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220617858_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220431519_Note_on_a_Lower_Bound_on_the_Linear_Complexity_of_the_Fast_Fourier_Transform","220430862_Optimality_of_the_Fast_Fourier_transform","220260743_Multiplikation_grosser_Zahlen","220111723_The_Trade-Off_Between_the_Additive_Complexity_and_the_Asynchronicity_of_Linear_and_Bilinear_Algorithms","215458980_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Computation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","202924195_Gauss_and_the_history_of_FFT","200104862_The_art_of_computer_programming_Volume_2_Seminumerical_algorithms_Reading","3319973_A_Modified_Split-Radix_FFT_With_Fewer_Arithmetic_Operations","2502526_An_Improved_Overlap_Argument_For_On-Line_Multiplication"]}
