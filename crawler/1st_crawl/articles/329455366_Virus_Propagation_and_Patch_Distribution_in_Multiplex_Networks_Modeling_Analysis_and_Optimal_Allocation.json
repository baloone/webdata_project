{"id":"329455366_Virus_Propagation_and_Patch_Distribution_in_Multiplex_Networks_Modeling_Analysis_and_Optimal_Allocation","abstract":"Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constrains of capacity of central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.","authors":["Dawei Zhao","Lianhai Wang","Zhen Wang","Gaoxi Xiao"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIFS.2018.2885254","Project: Social Contagion, Complex Networks"],"references":["326565133_A_Risk_Management_Approach_to_Defending_Against_the_Advanced_Persistent_Threat","325256732_Immunization_of_Epidemics_in_Multiplex_Networks","319339450_Optimal_Dissemination_Strategy_of_Security_Patch_Based_on_Differential_Game_in_Social_Network","316183798_Determinants_of_public_cooperation_in_multiplex_networks","308735533_A_distributed_patching_scheme_for_controlling_mobile_malware_infection","307536753_Statistical_physics_of_vaccination","305920110_On_the_Race_of_Worms_and_Patches_Modeling_the_Spread_of_Information_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","304006652_Virus_Propagation_Modeling_and_Convergence_Analysis_in_Large_Scale_Networks","301244032_Suppressing_disease_spreading_by_using_information_diffusion_on_multiplex_networks","283165872_Defending_Against_False_Data_Injection_Attacks_on_Power_System_State_Estimation","281778072_A_Novel_Virus-Patch_Dynamic_Model","275896883_Analysis_and_Control_of_Epidemics_A_Survey_of_Spreading_Processes_on_Complex_Networks","273394092_Malware_Propagation_in_Large-Scale_Networks","272397572_Optimal_information_dissemination_strategy_to_promote_preventive_behaviors_in_multilayer_epidemic_networks","270342990_Suppression_of_epidemic_spreading_in_complex_networks_by_local_information_based_behavioral_responses","263899546_Competitive_epidemic_spreading_over_arbitrary_multilayer_networks","262452286_Competing_spreading_processes_on_multiplex_networks_Awareness_and_epidemics","262189601_Asymmetrically_interacting_spreading_dynamics_on_complex_layered_networks","260641658_Optimal_Patching_in_Clustered_Malware_Epidemics","258817197_Optimal_Vaccine_Allocation_to_Control_Epidemic_Outbreaks_in_Arbitrary_Networks","258400243_An_Efficient_Patch_Dissemination_Strategy_for_Mobile_Networks","257634002_A_mixing_propagation_model_of_computer_viruses_and_countermeasures","257460322_Dynamical_Interplay_between_Awareness_and_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Multiplex_Networks","345685910_Vital_layer_nodes_of_multiplex_networks_for_immunization_and_attack","322514772_Optimal_Dismantling_of_Interdependent_Networks_Based_on_Inverse_Explosive_Percolation","322002786_Social_contagions_on_correlated_multiplex_networks","320695357_Information_cascades_in_complex_networks","318811341_A_Bi-Virus_Competing_Spreading_Model_with_Generic_Infection_Rates","318688652_An_Immunization_Framework_for_Social_Networks_Through_Big_Data_Based_Influence_Modeling","315903439_Epidemic_Protection_Over_Heterogeneous_Networks_Using_Evolutionary_Poisson_Games","312533799_Optimal_distributed_malware_defense_in_mobile_networks_with_heterogeneous_devices","311899572_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","311620822_Network_Community_Detection_Based_on_the_Physarum-Inspired_Computational_Framework","309659276_The_impact_of_patch_forwarding_on_the_prevalence_of_computer_virus_A_theoretical_assessment_approach","307472662_Optimal_Deployment_of_Resources_for_Maximizing_Impact_in_Spreading_Processes","305809177_The_robustness_of_interdependent_networks_under_the_interplay_between_cascading_failures_and_virus_propagation","305809093_Competing_spreading_processes_and_immunization_in_multiplex_networks","303092852_A_unified_framework_of_interplay_between_two_spreading_processes_in_multiplex_networks","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","282906898_K-Center_An_Approach_on_the_Multi-Source_Identification_of_Information_Diffusion","281670523_The_robustness_of_multiplex_networks_under_layer_node-based_attack","278160989_Finding_another_yourself_in_multiplex_networks","274572447_Networks_of_networks_-_An_introduction","262937367_Degree_mixing_in_multilayer_networks_impedes_the_evolution_of_cooperation","262150720_Smartphone_Malware_and_Its_Propagation_Modeling_A_Survey","262147707_Propagation_Model_of_Smartphone_Worms_Based_on_Semi-Markov_Process_and_Social_Relationship_Graph","261417380_Optimization_algorithms_for_epidemic_evolution_in_broadcast_networks","261122945_STOP_Socio-Temporal_Opportunistic_Patching_of_Short_Range_Mobile_Malware","260345487_Modeling_and_Restraining_Mobile_Virus_Propagation","260132483_Multiple_routes_transmitted_epidemics_on_multiplex_networks","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","235403833_Diffusion_Dynamics_on_Multiplex_Networks","234800698_Predators_Good_will_mobile_codes_combat_against_computer_viruses","243785180_The_Art_of_Computer_Virus_Research_and_Defense","228927668_Imperfect_targeted_immunization_in_scale-free_networks"]}
