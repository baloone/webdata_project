{"id":"283185946_HEIGHT_ACCURACY_BASED_ON_DIFFERENT_RTK_GPS_METHOD_FOR_ULTRALIGHT_AIRCRAFT_IMAGES","abstract":"Height accuracy is one of the important elements in surveying work especially for control pointâ€™s establishment which requires an\naccurate measurement. There are many methods can be used to acquire height value such as tacheometry, leveling and Global\nPositioning System (GPS). This study has investigated the effect on height accuracy based on different observations which are single\nbased and network based GPS methods. The GPS network is acquired from the local network namely Iskandar network. This\nnetwork has been setup to provide real-time correction data to rover GPS station while the single network is based on the known\nGPS station. Nine ground control points were established evenly at the study area. Each ground control points were observed about\ntwo and ten minutes. It was found that, the height accuracy give the different result for each observation.","authors":["Khairul Nizam Tahar"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-3-W3-287-2015"],"references":["335244379_Investigating_Accuracy_Enhancement_of_Global_Navigation_Satellite_System","289758660_The_Accuracy_of_Automatic_Photogrammetric_Techniques_on_Ultra-light_UAV_Imagery","263424719_Recent_applications_of_unmanned_aerial_imagery_in_natural_resource_management","220061695_Testing_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Missions_in_a_Scaled_Environment","302506829_Testing_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Missions_in_a_Scaled_Environment"]}
