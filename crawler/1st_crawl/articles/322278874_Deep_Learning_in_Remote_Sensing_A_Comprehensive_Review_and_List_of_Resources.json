{"id":"322278874_Deep_Learning_in_Remote_Sensing_A_Comprehensive_Review_and_List_of_Resources","abstract":"Central to the looming paradigm shift toward data-intensive science, machine-learning techniques are becoming increasingly important. In particular, deep learning has proven to be both a major breakthrough and an extremely powerful tool in many fields. Shall we embrace deep learning as the key to everything? Or should we resist a black-box solution? These are controversial issues within the remote-sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of using deep learning for remote-sensing data analysis, review recent advances, and provide resources we hope will make deep learning in remote sensing seem ridiculously simple. More importantly, we encourage remote-sensing scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning and use it as an implicit general model to tackle unprecedented, large-scale, influential challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.","authors":["Xiao Xiang Zhu","Devis Tuia","Lichao Mou","Gui-Song Xia"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine
