{"id":"24058601_On_the_Complexity_of_Testing_Membership_in_the_Core_of_Min-Cost_Spanning_Tree_Games","abstract":"Let $N=\\{ 1,...,n\\} $ be a finite set of players and $K_{N}$ the complete graph on the node set $N\\cup \\{ 0\\} $. Assume that the edges of $K_{N}$ have nonnegative weights and associate with each coalition $S\\subseteq N$ of players as cost $c(S)$ the weight of a minimal spanning tree on the node set $S\\cup \\{ 0\\} $. \nUsing transformation from EXACT COVER BY 3-SETS, we exhibit the following problem to be NP-complete. Given the vector $x\\in R^{N}$ with $x(N)=c(N)$. Decide whether there exists a coalition S such that $x(S) > c(S)$.","authors":["Ulrich Faigle","Walter Kern","Winfried Hochstättler","Sándor P.
