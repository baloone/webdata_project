{"id":"320350880_Model_Centered_Architecture","abstract":"This paper advocates a rigorous model focused paradigm of information system development and use. We introduce the concept of “Model Centered Architecture” that sees an information system to be a compound of various networked models, each of which is formed with the means of a Domain Specific Modeling Language. This languages are tailored to the particular circumstances of the respective system aspect. I.e., from a MOF perspective, MCA focuses on the MOF levels M2 (definitions of the DSMLs to be used for the specification of the system and it’s contexts), M1 (Specification of all System and Data Components using the DSMLs) andM0 (the instances, i.e. models of concrete objects, functions and processes). The transformation of M0 citizens to the respective implementation concepts (Structure →Data, Function→Program, Process→Workflow) is delegated to mapping functions defined on M2, restricted on M1 to the particular schemata (in the sense of mappings between the respective sets of schema instances), and instantiated on M0 for the concrete instances. The paper shows how such model centered approach may be applied in practice using two real development projects as running examples.","authors":["Heinrich C.
