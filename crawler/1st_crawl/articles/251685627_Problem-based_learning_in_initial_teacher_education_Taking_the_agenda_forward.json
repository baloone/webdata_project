{"id":"251685627_Problem-based_learning_in_initial_teacher_education_Taking_the_agenda_forward","abstract":"Problem-based learning (PBL) is not new; in one form or another, it has been around for considerable time. Indeed, as Menon (1997) points out, it may be seen as originating with Dewey at the turn of the century. In this article I examine definitions of PBL, and some of the challenges and problems it presents. I look at the evolution of PBL, and some of the applications of this methodology - together with some of the detailed research which has been undertaken in this field. I also discuss the current United Kingdom models of initial teacher education, outline possible uses of PBL in this area, and describe research carried out in the University of Glasgow. Finally, I provide some discussion about the applicability of PBL in the area of initial teacher education.","authors":["Alastair D McPhee"],"meta":["January 2002Journal of Educational Enquiry 3(1)"],"references":["303381853_Programs_of_Research_in_Teacher_Education","263570689_Teacher_education_and_teacher_development_A_comparative_study","261583186_Protocol_Analysis_as_a_Fruitful_Tool_for_a_Problem_Posing_Teacher_Education","248917455_Intellectuals_or_Technicians_The_Urgent_Role_of_Theory_in_Educational_Studies","233440882_Moving_Towards_Problem-based_Learning","14751207_Problem-based_learning_A_review_of_literature_on_its_outcomes_and_implementation_issues","13225717_Medical_Curriculum_Reform_in_North_America_1765_to_the_present_a_cognitive_science_perspective","345517690_The_Persistence_of_Myth_in_Teacher_Education_and_Teaching","340328018_Initial_Teacher_Training_The_Dialogue_of_Ideology_and_Culture","319838766_Teaching_in_a_Problem-Based_Course","307813897_Boldly_solving_the_world_A_critical_analysis_of_problem-based_learning_as_a_method_of_professional_education","303364691_The_Modern_Practice_of_Adult_Education","290858899_Psychological_perspectives_in_terrorism","248419238_What_Counts_as_Problem-based_Learning","247261864_Problem-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Medical_Education","246392895_Improving_the_effectiveness_of_tutors_in_problem-based_learning","239601262_The_Challenge_of_Problem-Based_Learning","233488181_An_Implementation_of_Active_Learning_and_its_Effect_on_the_Quality_of_Student_Learning","233025632_Questions_of_competence","227206258_Using_multimedia_to_overcome_the_problems_with_problem_based_learning","49304990_Simulation_in_the_Classroom","37359192_Problem-Based_Learning_in_a_Health_Science_Curriculum","21538297_Effects_of_expert_and_non-expert_facilitators_on_small-group_process_and_on_student_performance","21131377_Effects_of_tutors_with_subject_expertise_on_the_problem-based_tutorial_process","20562101_Essentials_of_problem-based_learning","16376234_Problem-Based_Learning_Rationale_and_Description","15337225_Tutoring_in_problem-based_learning_A_teacher_development_process","14981922_Problem-based_learning_Have_the_expectations_been_met","13225718_Do_we_all_mean_the_same_thing_by_''Problem-based_Learning''_A_review_of_the_concepts_and_a_formulation_of_the_ground_rules","12795808_Problem-Based_Learning","12647222_Student_Performances_on_Step_1_and_Step_2_of_the_United_States_Medical_Licensing_Examination_Following_Implementation_of_a_Problem-Based_Learning_Curriculum","12592245_Effectiveness_of_Problem-Based_Learning_Curricula_Research_and_Theory","12348890_Problem-Based_Learning_why_curricula_are_likely_to_show_little_effect_on_knowledge_and_clinical_skills","12348889_Effectiveness_of_problem-based_learning_curricula_Theory_practice_and_paper_darts"]}
