{"id":"322096091_Mutually_Orthogonal_Graph_Squares_for_Disjoint_Union_of_Stars","abstract":"A Latin square of order r represents the edge decomposition of the complete bipartite graph Kr;r by rK2. We denote by N(r; rK2) the maximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order r. Since N(r; G) is a natural extension of N(r; rK2), the computation of N(r; G) for general graphs is interesting and not attainable. In this paper, we are concerned with the Kronecker product of mutually orthogonal graph squares (MOGS) of the complete bipartite graphs and using this method to construct the new mutually orthogonal disjoint union of some complete bipartite graphs squares.","authors":["Ahmed El-Mesady","R.
