{"id":"220852923_A_Tone_Mapping_Algorithm_for_High_Contrast_Images","abstract":"A new method is presented that takes as an input a high dynamic range image and maps it into a limited range of luminance values reproducible by a display device. There is significant evidence that a similar operation is performed by early stages of human visual system (HVS). Our approach follows functionality of HVS without attempting to construct its sophisticated model. The operation is performed in three steps. First, we estimate local adaptation luminance at each point in the image. Then, a simple function is applied to these values to compress them into the required display range. Since important image details can be lost during this process, we then re-introduce details in the final pass over the image.","authors":["Michael Ashikhmin"],"meta":["January 2002","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th Eurographics Workshop on Rendering Techniques, Pisa, Italy, June 26-28, 2002"],"references":["243482360_Visual_Adaptation_and_Retinal_Gain_Controls","224282145_Vision_Science_From_Photons_to_Phenomenology","220853024_Interactive_Tone_Mapping","220183622_Two_Methods_for_Display_of_High_Contrast_Images","20879982_An_object-oriented_model_for_brightness_perception","3410826_A_Visibility_Matching_Tone_Reproduction_Operator_for_High_Dynamic_Range_Scenes","3208328_Tone_Reproduction_for_Realistic_Images","2908938_Photographic_Tone_Reproduction_For_Digital_Images","2593999_Physically-Based_Glare_Effects_for_Digital_Images","2573368_LCIS_A_Boundary_Hierarchy_For_Detail-Preserving_Contrast_Reduction","2465614_Time-Dependent_Visual_Adaptation_For_Fast_Realistic_Image_Display","2272006_Quantization_Techniques_for_Visualization_of_High_Dynamic_Range_Pictures","256379558_Digital_Image_Processing","242450410_A_Contrast-based_Scale_Factor_for_Luminance_Display","238996392_The_visual_effect_on_non-uniform_surrounds","234779648_Pyramidal_Parametrics","220721395_The_RADIANCE_lighting_simulation_and_rendering_system","220506468_Painting-like_Image_Emphasis_based_on_Human_Vision_Systems","47862721_Tone_Reproduction_for_Interactive_Walkthroughs","23329027_Brightness_Constancy_and_the_Nature_of_Achromatic_Colors","22226116_The_Retinex_Theory_of_Color_Vision","19903751_Visual_adaptation_is_highly_localized_in_the_cat's_retina","3326645_A_Multi_-_scale_Retinex_for_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Color_Images_and_the_Human_Observation_of_Scenes","3208966_Elements_of_early_vision_for_computer_graphics","2507670_A_Multiscale_Model_of_Adaptation_and_Spatial_Vision_for_Realistic_Image_Display","2450018_A_Model_of_Visual_Adaptation_for_Realistic_Image_Synthesis","2336169_Recovering_High_Dynamic_Range_Radiance_Maps_from_Photographs"]}
