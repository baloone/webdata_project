{"id":"343596188_Science_Forum_Imaging_methods_are_vastly_underreported_in_biomedical_research","abstract":"A variety of microscopy techniques are used by researchers in the life and biomedical sciences. As these techniques become more powerful and more complex, it is vital that scientific articles containing images obtained with advanced microscopes include full details about how each image was obtained. To explore the reporting of such details we examined 240 original research articles published in eight journals. We found that the quality of reporting was poor, with some articles containing no information about how images were obtained, and many articles lacking important basic details. Efforts by researchers, funding agencies, journals, equipment manufacturers and staff at shared imaging facilities are required to improve the reporting of experiments that rely on microscopy techniques.","authors":["Guillermo Marques","Thomas Pengo","Mark A Sanders"],"meta":["August 2020eLife Sciences 9","DOI:10.7554/eLife.55133"],"references":["345700077_Findings_of_a_retrospective_controlled_cohort_study_of_the_impact_of_a_change_in_Nature_journals'_editorial_policy_for_life_sciences_research_on_the_completeness_of_reporting_study_design_and_executio","341530957_Variability_in_the_analysis_of_a_single_neuroimaging_dataset_by_many_teams","339402025_No_raw_data_no_science_Another_possible_source_of_the_reproducibility_crisis","338563457_MINFLUX_nanoscopy_delivers_3D_multicolor_nanometer_resolution_in_cells","332236446_Fix_Your_Membrane_Receptor_Imaging_Actin_Cytoskeleton_and_CD4_Membrane_Organization_Disruption_by_Chemical_FixationData_Sheet_1pdfVideo_1AVIVideo_2AVIVideo_3AVIVideo_4AVI","332159306_FAIRsharing_as_a_community_approach_to_standards_repositories_and_policies","331910185_Designing_a_rigorous_microscopy_experiment_Validating_methods_and_avoiding_bias","338892806_The_Myc_tag_monoclonal_antibody_9E10_displays_highly_variable_epitope_recognition_dependent_on_neighboring_sequence_context","334387196_A_Multi-center_Study_on_the_Reproducibility_of_Drug-Response_Assays_in_Mammalian_Cell_Lines","332399721_Open_and_Reproducible_Research_on_Open_Science_Framework"]}
