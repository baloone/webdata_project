{"id":"267987625_Stabilizing_Consensus_With_the_Power_of_Two_Choices","abstract":"In the standard consensus problem there are n processes with possibly different input values and the goal is to even-tually reach a point at which all processes commit to exactly one of these values. We are studying a slight variant of the consensus problem called the stabilizing consensus problem [2]. In this problem, we do not require that each process commits to a final value at some point, but that eventually they arrive at a common, stable value without necessarily being aware of that. This should work irrespective of the states in which the processes are starting. Our main result is a simple randomized algorithm called median rule that, with high probability, just needs O(log m log log n + log n) time and work per process to arrive at an almost stable consensus for any set of m legal values as long as an adver-sary can corrupt the states of at most âˆš n processes at any time. Without adversarial involvement, just O(log n) time and work is needed for a stable consensus, with high prob-ability. As a by-product, we obtain a simple distributed algorithm for approximating the median of n numbers in time O(log m log log n + log n) under adversarial presence.","authors":["Benjamin Doerr","Leslie Ann Goldberg","Lorenz Minder","Thomas Sauerwald"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1145/1989493.1989516"],"references":["225255190_Easy_impossibility_proofs_for_distributed_consensus_problems","221437536_On_Balls_and_Bins_with_Deletions","221257707_Simple_Efficient_Shared_Memory_Simulations","220431045_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","45902900_Breaking_the_On2_Bit_Barrier_Scalable_Byzantine_Agreement_with_an_Adaptive_Adversary","2908260_A_Tight_Lower_Bound_for_Randomized_Synchronous_Consensus","2769810_Randomized_Protocols_for_Low-Congestion_Circuit_Routing_in_Multistage_Interconnection_Networks","2640251_Efficient_PRAM_Simulation_on_a_Distributed_Memory_Machine","2560914_Easy_Impossibility_Proofs_for_Distributed_Consensus_Problems","2362512_Balanced_Allocations","1957377_Medians_and_Beyond_New_Aggregation_Techniques_for_Sensor_Networks","269793392_New_York_Encyclopedia_of_Statistical_Sciences","266004355_Diffusion_Processes_and_Their_Sample_Paths","245954051_Distributed_Algorithms_Chapter_6_7","237679879_A_Note_on_Efficient_Aggregate_Queries_in_Sensor_Networks_Preliminary_Version","234759025_Efficient_PRAM_simulation_on_a_distributed_memory_machine","225685483_A_simple_population_protocol_for_fast_robust_approximate_majority","225467352_On_Expected_Constant-Round_Protocols_for_Byzantine_Agreement","224678292_Towards_Secure_and_Scalable_Computation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","223023499_On_expected_constant-round_protocols_for_Byzantine_agreement","221591891_Byzantine_agreement_in_the_full-information_model_in_O_log_n_rounds","221590683_Fast_asynchronous_Byzantine_agreement_with_optimal_resilience","221344321_Lower_Bounds_for_Randomized_Consensus_under_a_Weak_Adversary","221344161_Randomized_Consensus_in_Expected_On_log_n_Individual_Work","221343612_A_note_on_efficient_aggregate_queries_in_sensor_networks","221257456_10_Tight_Bounds_for_Distributed_Selection","221039315_When_Consensus_Meets_Self-stabilization","220975005_Stabilizing_Consensus_in_Mobile_Networks","220780421_The_power_of_memory_in_randomized_broadcasting","220780265_Distributed_Agreement_with_Optimal_Communication_Complexity","220780233_Approximate_Shared-Memory_Counting_Despite_a_Strong_Adversary","220779461_Fast_Asynchronous_Byzantine_Agreement_and_Leader_Election_with_Full_Information","220617896_An_Optimal_Probabilistic_Protocol_for_Synchronous_Byzantine_Agreement","220432418_Tight_bounds_for_asynchronous_randomized_consensus","4354946_Randomized_Byzantine_generals","4038189_Gossip-based_computation_of_aggregate_information","2566656_Reaching_Approximate_Agreement_In_The_Presence_Of_Faults","2547666_Randomized_Protocols_for_Asynchronous_Consensus"]}
