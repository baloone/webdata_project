In addition to developing an original measure of social-distancing fatigue (SDF), two hypothesized models, grounded in a social skills deficit framework, were tested using Model 4 of the Hayes’ PROCESS 3.0. Results indicated that participants’ level of cognitive flexibility associated negatively with SDF, and positively with adherence. Moreover, while feeling exhaustion/burnout associated positively with depressive symptoms and negatively with adherence, a sense of tedium did not.","authors":["John S.
