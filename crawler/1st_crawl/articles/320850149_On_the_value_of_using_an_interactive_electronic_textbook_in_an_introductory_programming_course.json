{"id":"320850149_On_the_value_of_using_an_interactive_electronic_textbook_in_an_introductory_programming_course","abstract":"E-books including interactive elements are rapidly becoming more popular and are likely to largely replace traditional textbooks at university level education. In this paper, we report our initial observations on the changes we noticed in students' motivational factors and learning results when a static PDF textbook was replaced by an interactive e-textbook in a large CS1 service course. We found increase in both motivational factors, as well as learning gain. In addition, students' feedback on the learning resources improved. While the changes were not large, they encourage to continue integrating more interactive learning content into course learning environment.","authors":["Kerttu Pollari-Malmi","Julio Guerra","Peter Brusilovsky","Lauri Malmi"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3141880.3141890","Conference: the 17th Koli Calling Conference","Projects: Smart Electronic TextbooksInfrastructure for Computer Science Education"],"references":["301463457_Usability_and_Usage_of_Interactive_Features_in_an_Online_Ebook_for_CS_Teachers","262160581_Parson's_programming_puzzles_A_fun_and_effective_learning_tool_for_first_programming_courses","246043927_Electronic_textbooks_on_WWW_from_static_hypertext_to_interactivity_and_adaptivity","311608888_Jsvee_Kelmu_Creating_and_Tailoring_Program_Animations_for_Computing_Education","311489010_OpenDSA_An_Interactive_eTextbook_for_Computer_Science_Courses","310819063_Identifying_Design_Principles_for_CS_Teacher_Ebooks_through_Design-Based_Research","300115209_Analysis_of_Interactive_Features_Designed_to_Enhance_Learning_in_an_Ebook","262254018_Requirements_and_design_strategies_for_open_source_interactive_computer_science_eBooks","246387802_How_can_hypermedia_tools_help_teach_programming","222408779_A_Meta-Study_of_Algorithm_Visualization_Effectiveness"]}
