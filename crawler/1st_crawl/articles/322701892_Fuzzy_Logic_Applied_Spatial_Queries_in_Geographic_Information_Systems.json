{"id":"322701892_Fuzzy_Logic_Applied_Spatial_Queries_in_Geographic_Information_Systems","abstract":"In the recent years, the usage of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has been rapidly increasing and it became the main tool for analyzing spatial data in unprecedented number of fields of activities. The processing time is important and currently uses more advanced applied mathematical and computer science knowledge: One of these mathematical theories is fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic theory gives the possibility of enhancing spatial data management with the modelling of uncertainty. In this paper, the applicability of fuzzy set theory has been presented to respond spatial queries and the comparison performance between normal and spatial queries.","authors":["Angélica F.
