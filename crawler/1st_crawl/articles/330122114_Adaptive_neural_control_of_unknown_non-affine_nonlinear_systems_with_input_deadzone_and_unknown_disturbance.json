{"id":"330122114_Adaptive_neural_control_of_unknown_non-affine_nonlinear_systems_with_input_deadzone_and_unknown_disturbance","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive neural scheme is developed for unknown non-affine nonlinear systems with input deadzone and internal/external unknown disturbance. With the help of mean value theorem and implicit function theorem, the control problem that the system input cannot be expressed in a linear form can be solved. The unknown input deadzone is approximated by neural networks. The immeasurable states are estimated by a high-gain observer such that output feedback control is obtained. The approximation error of both neural networks and the unknown internal/external disturbance is considered as an overall disturbance which is compensated by a novel disturbance observer. Via Lyapunovâ€™s stability theory, it can be proved that all the state signals are uniformly bounded ultimately. The transient response performance can be improved by tuning the control parameters, and the steady-state error converges to any small neighborhood of zero. Simulation examples are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","authors":["Shuang Zhang","Linghuan Kong","Suwen Qi","Peng Jing"],"meta":["January 2019Nonlinear Dynamics 95(9)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-018-4629-8"],"references":["324484174_Adaptive_neural_novel_prescribed_performance_control_for_non-affine_pure-feedback_systems_with_input_saturation","323544763_Adaptive_NN_finite-time_tracking_control_of_output_constrained_nonlinear_system_with_input_saturation","345255552_Disturbance_Observer-Based_Control_Methods_and_Applications","323646474_Adaptive_Neural_Control_for_Robotic_Manipulators_With_Output_Constraints_and_Uncertainties","323491466_An_adaptive_RBF_neural_network_control_method_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems","323490099_Composite_learning_robot_control_with_guaranteed_parameter_convergence","322515753_Composite_Learning_Control_of_MIMO_Systems_With_Applications","322190558_Residential_energy_scheduling_for_variable_weather_solar_energy_based_on_adaptive_dynamic_programming","320089195_Prescribed_Performance_Observer-Based_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Control_for_Nonstrict-Feedback_Stochastic_Nonlinear_Systems","319871720_Parallel_driving_in_CPSS_A_unified_approach_for_transport_automation_and_vehicle_intelligence","319576879_Ephemeris_Corrections_in_CelestialPulsar_Navigation_Using_Time_Differential_and_Ephemeris_Estimation","319869592_A_survey_of_human-centered_intelligent_robots_Issues_and_challenges","318741015_Adaptive_Neural_Network_Control_of_a_Robotic_Manipulator_With_Time-Varying_Output_Constraints","318615532_Broad_Learning_System_An_Effective_and_Efficient_Incremental_Learning_System_Without_the_Need_for_Deep_Architecture","318126607_Adaptive_Critic_Nonlinear_Robust_Control_A_Survey"]}
