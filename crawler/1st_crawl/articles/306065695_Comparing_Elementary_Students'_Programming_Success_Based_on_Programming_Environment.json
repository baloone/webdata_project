{"id":"306065695_Comparing_Elementary_Students'_Programming_Success_Based_on_Programming_Environment","abstract":"In the Republic of Croatia Informatics is an elective course in elementary school for students from 5th to 8th grade. When it comes to programming language teachers can choose between BASIC and Logo. There are a lot of new programming environments for learning and teaching programming like Scratch and also new ways of teaching programming like game based learning. This study compares attitudinal and learning outcomes of 7th-grade students programming in Logo and Scratch. The classes were normal classes, non-extracurricular activities. The questionnaire is used to measure the attitude towards programming and programming languages. The test is constructed to measure learned programming concepts in both compared programming languages Logo and Scratch. Results showed that learning Scratch first can provide a better understanding of basic programming concept for novices in elementary school than Logo.","authors":["Monika Mladenović","Marko Rosić","Sasa Mladenovic"],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science 8(8):1-10","DOI:10.5815/ijmecs.2016.08.01","Project: Artificial Intelligence in COMplex Problem solvIng and LEarning – AI COMPILE"],"references":["275309732_Students_attitude_towards_informatics_curricula","275308500_Elementary_students'_attitude_towards_programming_in_the_Republic_of_Croatia","274708385_Elementary_Students'_Motivation_Towards_Informatics_Course","271746747_The_Effects_of_Teaching_Programming_via_Scratch_on_Problem_Solving_Skills_A_Discussion_from_Learners'_Perspective","262316599_The_effect_of_logo_programming_language_for_creativity_and_problem_solving","257716773_Students'_Perception_and_Motivation_Towards_Programming","289103667_Evaluation_of_computer_games_developed_by_primary_school_children_to_gauge_understanding_of_programming_concepts","276555166_From_Scratch_to_Real_Programming","254462725_Spaghetti_for_the_main_course_Observations_on_the_naturalness_of_scenario-based_programming","252662721_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_the_Relationship_Between_Success_in_Mathematics_and_Visual_Programming_Courses"]}
