{"id":"275669977_A_Semidefinite_Programming_Method_for_Integer_Convex_Quadratic_Minimization","abstract":"We consider the NP-hard problem of minimizing a convex quadratic function\nover the integer lattice $Z^n$. We present a semidefinite programming (SDP)\nmethod for obtaining a nontrivial lower bound on the optimal value of the\nproblem. By interpreting the solution to the SDP relaxation probabilistically,\nwe obtain a randomized algorithm for finding good suboptimal solutions. The\neffectiveness of the method is shown for numerical problem instances of various\nsizes. Finally, we introduce several extensions to the idea, including how to\nreduce the search space of existing branch-and-bound type enumeration\nalgorithms for solving the problem globally, by using the tighter lower and\nupper bounds.","authors":["Jaehyun Park","Stephen Boyd"],"meta":["May 2018Optimization Letters 12(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11590-017-1132-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272422876_Supersparse_Linear_Integer_Models_for_Optimized_Medical_Scoring_Systems","303352395_Improved_methods_for_calculating_vectors_of_short_length_in_a_lattice_including_a_complexity_analysis","285688992_Semidefinite_programming","276102538_Ellipsoid_Bounds_for_Convex_Quadratic_Integer_Programming","268249375_Nonconvex_Quadratic_Programming_Semidefinite_Relaxations_and_Randomization_Algorithms_in_Information_and_Decision_Systems","266920710_Generating_hard_instance_of_lattice_problems","261715753_When_is_rounding_allowed_in_integer_nonlinear_optimization","261029102_Relaxing_Nonconvex_Quadratic_Functions_by_Multiple_Adaptive_Diagonal_Perturbations","260082656_Branch-And-bound_methods_A_survey","257548877_An_efficient_compact_quadratic_convex_reformulation_for_general_integer_quadratic_programs","254400593_Semidefinite_relaxation_and_nonconvex_quadratic_optimization","246433453_Improved_Methods_for_Calculating_Vectors_of_Short_Length_in_a_Lattice_Including_a_Complexity_Analysis","245588993_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems1","243528204_Seminumerical_algorithms_the_art_of_computer_programmhrg_2","242528073_Improved_methods_for_calculating_vectors_of_short_length_in_a_lattice"]}
