{"id":"267983349_Sound_power_radiation_from_a_vibrating_structure_in_terms_of_structure-dependent_radiation_modes","abstract":"A new technique for describing the sound power radiation from a vibrating structure is introduced that is based on a set of uncoupled, structure-dependent radiation modes (s-modes). These modes differ from conventional acoustic radiation modes (a-modes) since s-modes are determined by not only the radiation resistance matrix of the structure but also its structural vibration modes. In principle, s-modes are found to possess two significant advantages over a-modes: (1) the number of s-modes required to describe the radiated sound power from a vibrating structure is usually smaller than that of a-modes, especially in the higher frequency range where many vibration modes contribute to the structural vibration; (2) the definition of s-modes establishes a direct connection between the structural modes or structural wave propagation and their sound radiation properties; consequently, the inherent relationship between the modal properties/wave propagation characteristics of the structure and its sound radiation properties can be revealed in a convenient and explicit manner. Two examples, featuring baffled, finite models, i.e., an Euler-beam (1-dimensional) and a thin plate (2-dimensional), are employed to illustrate the main theoretical results of the present study.","authors":["Lin ji","J.
