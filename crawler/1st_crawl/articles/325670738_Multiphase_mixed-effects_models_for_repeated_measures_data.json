{"id":"325670738_Multiphase_mixed-effects_models_for_repeated_measures_data","abstract":"Behavior that develops in phases may exhibit distinctively different rates of change in one time period than in others. In this article, a mixed-effects model for a response that displays identifiable regimes is reviewed. An interesting component of the model is the change point. In substantive terms, the change point is the time when development switches from one phase to another. In a mixed-effects model, the change point can be a random coefficient. This possibility allows individuals to make the transition from one phase to another at different ages or after different lengths of time in treatment. Two examples are reviewed in detail, both of which can be estimated with software that is widely available.","authors":["R. Cudeck","K.J.
