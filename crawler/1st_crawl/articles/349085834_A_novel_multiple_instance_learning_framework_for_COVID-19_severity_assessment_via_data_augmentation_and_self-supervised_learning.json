{"id":"349085834_A_novel_multiple_instance_learning_framework_for_COVID-19_severity_assessment_via_data_augmentation_and_self-supervised_learning","abstract":"How to fast and accurately assess the severity level of COVID-19 is an essential problem, when millions of people are suffering from the pandemic around the world. Currently, the chest CT is regarded as a popular and informative imaging tool for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, we observe that there are two issues â€“ weak annotation and insufficient data that may obstruct automatic COVID-19 severity assessment with CT images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel three-component method, i.e., 1) a deep multiple instance learning component with instance-level attention to jointly classify the bag and also weigh the instances, 2) a bag-level data augmentation component to generate virtual bags by reorganizing high confidential instances, and 3) a self-supervised pretext component to aid the learning process. We have systematically evaluated our method on the CT images of 229 COVID-19 cases, including 50 severe and 179 non-severe cases. Our method could obtain an average accuracy of 95.8%, with 93.6% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity, which outperformed previous works.","authors":["Zekun Li","Wei Zhao","Feng Shi","Lei Qi"],"meta":["February 2021Medical Image Analysis 69(4):101978","DOI:10.1016/j.media.2021.101978"],"references":["347400584_Models_Genesis","345762746_AI-Driven_quantification_staging_and_outcome_prediction_of_COVID-19_pneumonia","340170617_CT_image_visual_quantitative_evaluation_and_clinical_classification_of_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19","334279066_A_survey_on_Image_Data_Augmentation_for_Deep_Learning","323931846_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_by_Predicting_Image_Rotations","323165042_Attention-based_Deep_Multiple_Instance_Learning","321324833_Exploiting_the_potential_of_unlabeled_endoscopic_video_data_with_self-supervised_learning","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","319151271_Random_Erasing_Data_Augmentation","315655760_Smart_Augmentation_-_Learning_an_Optimal_Data_Augmentation_Strategy","312173565_Multiple-Instance_Learning_for_Medical_Image_and_Video_Analysis","309154748_Patch-Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Whole_Slide_Tissue_Image_Classification","308873484_Deep_multiple_instance_learning_for_image_classification_and_auto-annotation","301837491_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Representations_by_Solving_Jigsaw_Puzzles","277023095_Unsupervised_Visual_Representation_Learning_by_Context_Prediction","215616968_Understanding_the_difficulty_of_training_deep_feedforward_neural_networks","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","347103870_Abnormal_Lung_Quantification_in_Chest_CT_Images_of_COVID-19_Patients_with_Deep_Learning_and_its_Application_to_Severity_Prediction","343456678_Momentum_Contrast_for_Unsupervised_Visual_Representation_Learning","343427002_Integrative_Analysis_for_COVID-19_Patient_Outcome_Prediction","341555527_Accurate_Screening_of_COVID-19_using_Attention_Based_Deep_3D_Multiple_Instance_Learning","340359021_Chest_CT_Severity_Score_An_Imaging_Tool_for_Assessing_Severe_COVID-19","339554624_Boosting_Few-Shot_Visual_Learning_With_Self-Supervision","338511824_AutoAugment_Learning_Augmentation_Strategies_From_Data","334703759_Self-supervised_learning_for_medical_image_analysis_using_image_context_restoration","331425683_Semi-supervised_Learning_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","331416343_Improving_Deep_Learning_with_Generic_Data_Augmentation","325522195_Synthetic_data_augmentation_using_GAN_for_improved_liver_lesion_classification","324584608_Not-so-supervised_A_survey_of_semi-supervised_multi-instance_and_transfer_learning_in_medical_image_analysis","321794300_The_Effectiveness_of_Data_Augmentation_in_Image_Classification_using_Deep_Learning","320627230_mixup_Beyond_Empirical_Risk_Minimization","319299592_A_Brief_Introduction_to_Weakly_Supervised_Learning","319135616_Improved_Regularization_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Cutout","316445968_Multiple_Instance_Learning_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_object_recognition","311066403_Semi-supervised_Learning_using_Denoising_Autoencoders_for_Brain_Lesion_Detection_and_Segmentation","308850633_From_image-level_to_pixel-level_labeling_with_Convolutional_Networks","308278737_Learning_Representations_for_Automatic_Colorization","308277343_Colorful_Image_Colorization","308277283_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Representations_by_Solving_Jigsaw_Puzzles","305350917_Variational_Weakly-Supervised_Gaussian_Processes","301816789_Context_Encoders_Feature_Learning_by_Inpainting","293014405_Locality_Sensitive_Deep_Learning_for_Detection_and_Classification_of_Nuclei_in_Routine_Colon_Cancer_Histology_Images","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","259084960_Multiple_instance_classification_Review_taxonomy_and_comparative_study","221346090_Multiple_Instance_Learning_with_Manifold_Bags"]}
