{"id":"221394276_Canonical_Horn_Representations_and_Query_Learning","abstract":"We describe an alternative construction of an existing canon- ical representation for definite Horn theories, the Guigues-Duquenne ba- sis (or GD basis), which minimizes a natural notion of implicational size. We extend the canonical representation to general Horn, by providing a reduction from definite to general Horn CNF. We show how this repre- sentation relates to two topics in query learning theory: first, we show that a well-known algorithm by Angluin, Frazier and Pitt that learns Horn CNF always outputs the GD basis independently of the counterex- amples it receives; second, we build strong polynomial certificates for Horn CNF directly from the GD basis.","authors":["Marta Arias","José L.
