{"id":"328334228_Systematic_Literature_review_from_Electronic_Database_-Islamic_perspective","abstract":"A literature Review (LR) is a summary of the existing research on a specific topic from the electronic database. It must be based on secondary sources like research papers, journals, articles or books which are already published. It does not concern about new innovation, but it is possible to find the further research according to scholarâ€™s opinion.\n\nSystematic Literature Review (SLR) innovated approximately 40 years ago for the research in health sector. Since the method of literature review is well organized and well accepted by the scholars, it is spreading in various sectors like engineering, computer science, social science etc. \n\nThe objectives of this paper are to compare the systematic literature review from secondary sources with the literature review procedure from Islamic perspective. The new version of systematic literature review is like the procedure of Islamic review which Allah (SWT) already teaches us long time ago.\n\nThough SLR from electronic database has got popularity in last few decades, Allah (SWT) gives us this instruction 1400 years ago by the Quran and Hadith. The method of SLR from electronic database and the method of SLR in Islam both have similarities to do research findings.","authors":["Mohammed Ashikur Rahman","Atikul Islam Liton"],"meta":["October 2018","Project: Data Mining"],"references":[]}
