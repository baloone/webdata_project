{"id":"220994452_Improved_Algorithms_for_the_Range_Next_Value_Problem_and_Applications","abstract":"The Range Next Value problem (Problem RNV) is a recent interesting variant of the range search problems, where the query is for the immediate next (or equal) value of a given number within a given interval of an array. Problem RNV was introduced and studied very recently by Crochemore et. al (Finding Patterns In Given Intervals, MFCS 2007). In this paper, we present improved algorithms for Problem RNV. We also show how this problem can be used to achieve optimal query time for a number of interesting variants of the classic pattern matching problems.","authors":["Maxime Crochemore","Costas Iliopoulos","Marcin Kubica","Mohammad Sohel Rahman"],"meta":["February 2008Theoretical Computer Science 434:205-216","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2008.1359","SourceDBLP","Conference: STACS 2008, 25th Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, Bordeaux, France, February 21-23, 2008, Proceedings"],"references":["221220163_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220980109_The_LCA_problem_revisited","220976335_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220897494_Solving_the_String_Statistics_Problem_in_Time_On_log_n","2567898_High-Order_Entropy-Compressed_Text_Indexes","284471379_Range_non-overlapping_indexing_and_successive_list_indexing","256484410_Private_communication","228057866_On_Finding_Lowest_Common_Ancestors_Simplification_and_Parallelization","226941492_On_finding_lowest_common_ancestors_Simplification_and_parallelization","226138130_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_for_the_String_Statistics_Problem","225035654_Fast_Algorithms_for_Finding_Nearest_Common_Ancestors","222684148_Rank_and_select_revisited_and_extended","221590107_Scaling_and_Related_Techniques_for_Geometry_Problems","221543333_Space-Efficient_Data_Structures_for_Flexible_Text_Retrieval_Systems","221444095_A_New_Succinct_Representation_of_RMQ-Information_and_Improvements_in_the_Enhanced_Suffix_Array","220980228_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220657819_Sadakane_K_Succinct_Data_Structures_for_Flexible_Text_Retrieval_Systems_Journal_of_Discrete_Algorithms_51_12-22","220617848_Recursive_Star-Tree_Parallel_Data_Structure","23647393_Optimal_Succinctness_for_Range_Minimum_Queries","3501857_Space-efficient_Static_Trees_and_Graphs"]}
