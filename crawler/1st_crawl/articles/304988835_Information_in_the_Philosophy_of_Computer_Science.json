{"id":"304988835_Information_in_the_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","abstract":"During the last decade, the philosophy of computer science has carved an important space within the landscape of philosophical investigations. The range of questions and problems it addresses is wide and varied: the methodology of design, the ontology and semantics of computational artefacts, abstraction and implementation, to name a few.
