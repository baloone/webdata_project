{"id":"315182436_Bit_from_It","abstract":"With his aphorism ‘it from bit’, Wheeler argued that anything physical, any it, ultimately derives its very existence entirely from discrete detector-elicited information-theoretic answers to yes or no quantum binary choices: bits. In this spirit, many theorists now give ontological primacy to information. To test the idea, I identify three distinct kinds of information and find that things, not information, are primary. Examination of what Wheeler meant by ‘it’ and ‘bit’ then leads me to invert his aphorism: ‘bit’ derives from ‘it’. I argue that this weakens but not necessarily destroys the argument that nature is fundamentally digital and continuity an illusion. There may also be implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the nature of time, causality and the world (For publication in this volume, I have added some new footnotes, dated 2014, in which I indicate developments in my thinking since the essay competition, giving details of any appropriate publications. I also take the opportunity, omitted at the time, to respond to some of the comments that were made of my essay in FQXi posts (at http:// fqxi. org/ community/ forum/ topic/ 911). I have also, without noting them, made a few trivial changes to the text for the sake of greater clarity and precision).","authors":["Julian Barbour"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-12946-4_17","In book: It From Bit or Bit From It?"],"references":["235712364_The_Solution_to_the_Problem_of_Time_in_Shape_Dynamics","231040293_The_physical_gravitational_degrees_of_freedom","51889741_Shape_Dynamics_An_Introduction","47386180_Einstein_gravity_as_a_3D_conformally_invariant_theory","24165822_The_Nature_of_Time","1978635_Classical_and_Quantum_Gravity_on_Conformal_Superspace","1967058_Dynamics_of_Pure_Shape_Relativity_and_the_Problem_of_Time","288896410_The_Deep_and_Suggestive_Principles_of_Leibnizian_Philosophy","235410472_Science_and_Ultimate_Reality"]}
