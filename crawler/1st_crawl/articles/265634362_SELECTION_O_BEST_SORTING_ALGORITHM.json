{"id":"265634362_SELECTION_O_BEST_SORTING_ALGORITHM","abstract":"The problem of sorting is a problem that arises frequently in computer programming. Many different sorting algorithms have been developed and improved to make sorting fast. As a measure of performance mainly the average number of operations or the average execution times of these algorithms have been investigated and compared. There is no one sorting method that is best for every situation. Some of the factors to be considered in choosing a sorting algorithm include the size of the list to be sorted, the programming effort, the number of words of main memory available, the size of disk or tape units, the extent to which the list is already ordered, and the distribution of values.","authors":["aditya dev Mishra","Deepak Garg"],"meta":[],"references":["3593069_A_new_efficient_radix_sort","237127755_Algorithm_Data_Structure_Programs","221392436_CC-Radix_a_Cache_Conscious_Sorting_Based_on_Radix_sort","220692549_Introduction_to_Algorithms_3_ed","216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching","202232988_Algorithm_64_Quicksort","31637733_Algorithms_Data_Structures_Programs_N_Wirth","4038158_An_in-place_sorting_with_O_n_log_n_comparisons_and_O_n_Moves","2336451_The_Influence_of_Caches_on_the_Performance_of_Sorting","2301118_A_Survey_of_Adaptive_Sorting_Algorithms"]}
