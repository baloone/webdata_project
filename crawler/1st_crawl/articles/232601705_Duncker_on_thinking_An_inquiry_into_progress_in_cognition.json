{"id":"232601705_Duncker_on_thinking_An_inquiry_into_progress_in_cognition","abstract":"In considering what psychologists have learned about cognition in the last 100 years, the author considers a particular scientist, Karl Duncker, and indeed a particular work, \nZur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens, originally published in 1935 and translated as On Problem Solving in 1945. Duncker studied how human adults solved various mathematical and practical problems. The author focuses on what has been learned since Duncker, what the scientist knew and what his scientific tasks were, what psychologists know about cognition, and where they stand on Dunckers' tasks. Contrasting the present state of problem solving with that of Duncker himself, the advanced claimed seem primarily in the form \"we now have more precise models.\" That might seem a modest claim, but the author does not think so. Casting the problem of cognition within a world of mechanism generated the conceptual storm of the 1950s and the waves that swept all before them.
