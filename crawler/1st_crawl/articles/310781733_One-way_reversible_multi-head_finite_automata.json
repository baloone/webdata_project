{"id":"310781733_One-way_reversible_multi-head_finite_automata","abstract":"One-way multi-head finite automata are considered towards their ability to perform reversible computations. It is shown that, for every number of heads, there are problems which can be solved by one-way k-head finite automata, but not by any one-way reversible k-head finite automaton. Additionally, a proper head hierarchy is obtained for one-way reversible multi-head finite automata. Closure properties and decidability problems are investigated as well. It turns out that one-way reversible finite automata with two heads are still a powerful model, since almost all commonly studied problems are not even semidecidable. Finally, descriptional complexity aspects are studied and non-recursive trade-offs are shown.","authors":["Martin Kutrib","Andreas Malcher"],"meta":["November 2016Theoretical Computer Science 682","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.11.006"],"references":["222555759_Reversible_Computation_and_Reversible_Programming_Languages","311938039_Reversible_Queue_Automata","303931158_Real-Time_Reversible_One-Way_Cellular_Automata","301902944_Set_Automata","292123042_Economy_of_description_by_automata_grammars_and_formal_systems","269359468_Head_and_state_hierarchies_for_unary_multi-head_finite_automata","267167736_Descriptional_Complexity_-_An_Introductory_Survey","262400213_Reversible_Multi-head_Finite_Automata_Characterize_Reversible_Logarithmic_Space","234829070_On_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","226119555_One-way_multihead_deterministic_finite_automata","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","222783480_Reversing_Algebraic_Process_Calculi","222126229_Fast_reversible_language_recognition_using_cellular_automata","221498634_Economy_of_Description_by_Automata_Grammars_and_Formal_Systems","221467314_Descriptional_Complexity_of_Cellular_Automata_and_Decidability_Questions","220980146_On_Reversible_Automata","220897886_Reversible_Flowchart_Languages_and_the_Structured_Reversible_Program_Theorem","220617456_On_the_Succinctness_of_Different_Representations_of_Languages","220443533_Two-Way_Reversible_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata","220432484_Inference_of_Reversible_Languages","220431014_k_1_Heads_Are_Better_than_k","220247092_One-Way_Multihead_Writing_Finite_Automata","220197312_On_Non-Determinancy_in_Simple_Computing_Devices","220155351_Reversible_computing_and_cellular_automata_-_A_survey","220148403_Real-time_reversible_iterative_arrays"]}
