{"id":"264085315_Communal_and_Agentic_Content_in_Social_Cognition_A_Dual_Perspective_Model","abstract":"We summarize and integrate a large body of research showing that agency and communion\nconstitute two fundamental dimensions of content in social cognition. Agentic content\nrefers to goal-achievement and task functioning (competence, assertiveness,\ndecisiveness), whereas communal content refers to the maintenance of relationships\nand social functioning (benevolence, trustworthiness,morality).Wepresent a Dual Perspective\nModel of Agency and Communion (DPM-AC) developed to show that the two dimensions\nare differently linked to the basic perspectives in social interaction, that is, the actor\nversus the observer/recipient perspectives. We review numerous research confirming\nthree general hypotheses of the DPM. First, communal content is primary among the\nfundamental dimensions. Second, in the observer/recipient perspective (perception of\nothers), communal content receives more weight than agentic content. Third, in the actor\nperspective (self-perception), agentic content receives more weight than communal content.\nWethen discuss the complex issues of relations of agency and communion to valence\nas well as associations between agency and communion. Although they are logically\nindependent and their inferences are based on different cues, the two content dimensions\nof meaning frequently function as psychological alternatives in social cognition.","authors":["Andrea E.
