{"id":"319770170_Deep_Features_for_Text_Spotting","abstract":"The goal of this work is text spotting in natural images. This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learn- ing with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures.","authors":["Max Jaderberg","Andrea Vedaldi","Andrew Zisserman"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10593-2_34","Conference: ECCV"],"references":["265022827_Visualizing_Higher-Layer_Features_of_a_Deep_Network","261349846_ICDAR_2013_robust_reading_competition","259399973_Multi-digit_Number_Recognition_from_Street_View_Imagery_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","257472193_Detection_of_artificial_and_scene_text_in_images_and_video_frames","257410140_End-to-End_Text_Recognition_with_Hybrid_HMM_Maxout_Models","249916206_Key-text_spotting_in_documentary_videos_using_Adaboost","239762642_Robust_Recognition_of_Degraded_Documents_Using_Character_N-Grams","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","224265630_ICDAR_2011_Robust_Reading_Competition_Challenge_2_Reading_Text_in_Scene_Images","224164328_Detecting_Text_in_Natural_Scenes_with_Stroke_Width_Transform","221416071_Character_Recognition_in_Natural_Images","221364268_Fast_Keypoint_Recognition_in_Ten_Lines_of_Code","221120132_Robust_text_detection_in_natural_images_with_edge-enhanced_Maximally_Stable_Extremal_Regions","221110077_End-to-end_scene_text_recognition","4214766_ICDAR_2005_text_locating_competition_results","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","271551262_PhotoOCR_Reading_Text_in_Uncontrolled_Conditions","271454229_Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","264891416_End-to-End_Text_Recognition_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262401631_Accurate_and_robust_text_detection_a_step-in_for_text_retrieval_in_natural_scene_images","262380602_Speeding_up_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Low_Rank_Expansions","262325598_Large-Lexicon_Attribute-Consistent_Text_Recognition_in_Natural_Images","261199296_Whole_is_Greater_than_Sum_of_Parts_Recognizing_Scene_Text_Words","261121699_Real-time_scene_text_localization_and_recognition","259399927_Deep_Inside_Convolutional_Networks_Visualising_Image_Classification_Models_and_Saliency_Maps","259399747_Fast_Training_of_Convolutional_Networks_through_FFTs","259394482_Toward_Integrated_Scene_Text_Reading","257627434_A_framework_for_improved_video_text_detection_and_recognition","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","257249133_Robust_Text_Detection_in_Natural_Scene_Images","255565360_Scene_Text_Recognition_using_Higher_Order_Language_Priors","252482398_Interactive_Graph_Cuts_for_Optimal_Boundary_Region_Segmentation_of_Objects_in_N-D_Images","232203667_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Gray-Level_Histograms","225659989_Word_spotting_for_historical_documents","225223935_Pictorial_Structures_for_Object_Recognition","224265511_Text_Detection_and_Character_Recognition_in_Scene_Images_with_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning","224201137_Using_text-spotting_to_query_the_world","222521233_Robust_Wide_Baseline_Stereo_from_Maximally_Stable_Extremal_Regions","221304612_Word_Spotting_in_the_Wild","221259950_Robust_Wide_Baseline_Stereo_from_Maximally_Stable_Extremal_Regions","220860341_Text_Localization_in_Real-World_Images_Using_Efficiently_Pruned_Exhaustive_Search","220745354_A_Method_for_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_in_Real-World_Images","50408991_Text_String_Detection_From_Natural_Scenes_by_Structure-Based_Partition_and_Grouping","4082344_Sharing_Features_Efficient_Boosting_Procedures_for_Multiclass_Object_Detection","4082279_Detecting_and_reading_text_in_natural_scenes"]}
