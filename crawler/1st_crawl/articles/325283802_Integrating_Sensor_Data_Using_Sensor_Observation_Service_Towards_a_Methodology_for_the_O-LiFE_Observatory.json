{"id":"325283802_Integrating_Sensor_Data_Using_Sensor_Observation_Service_Towards_a_Methodology_for_the_O-LiFE_Observatory","abstract":"This paper introduces an approach illustrating how the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework can be used in order to build a franco-lebanese observatory. We present the practical application of SWE services as a source of real-time observation data and the associated technical \narchitecture for making near real-time observations available to end users on the Web. We discuss the question of crossing sensor data with other data sources, e.g., data provided by human observations. We illustrate our approach by describing the methodology to integrate a first illustration case to monitor snow weather stations in the \nLebanese Mountains.","authors":["Hicham Hajj-Hassan","Nicolas Arnaud","Laurent Drapeau","Anne Laurent"],"meta":["November 2015Sensors and Transducers 194(11)","Project: O-LIFE"],"references":[]}
