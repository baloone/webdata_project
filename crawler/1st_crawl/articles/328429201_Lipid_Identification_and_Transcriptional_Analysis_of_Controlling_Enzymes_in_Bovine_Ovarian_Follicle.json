{"id":"328429201_Lipid_Identification_and_Transcriptional_Analysis_of_Controlling_Enzymes_in_Bovine_Ovarian_Follicle","abstract":"Ovarian follicle provides a favorable environment for enclosed oocytes, which acquire their competence in supporting embryo development in tight communications with somatic follicular cells and follicular fluid (FF). Although steroidogenesis in theca (TH) and granulosa cells (GC) is largely studied, and the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid (FA) metabolism in cumulus cells (CC) and oocytes are emerging, little data is available regarding lipid metabolism regulation within ovarian follicles. In this study, we investigated lipid composition and the transcriptional regulation of FA metabolism in 3–8 mm ovarian follicles in bovine. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS), 438 and 439 lipids were identified in FF and follicular cells, respectively. From the MALDI-TOF MS lipid fingerprints of FF, TH, GC, CC, and oocytes, and the MS imaging of ovarian \nsections, we identified 197 peaks and determined more abundant lipids in each compartment. Transcriptomics revealed lipid metabolism-related genes, which were expressed constitutively or more specifically in TH, GC, CC, or oocytes. Coupled with differential lipid composition, these data suggest that the ovarian follicle contains the metabolic machinery that is potentially capable of metabolizing FA from nutrient uptake, degrading and producing lipoproteins, performing de novo lipogenesis, and accumulating lipid reserves, thus assuring oocyte energy supply, membrane synthesis, and lipid-mediated signaling to maintain follicular homeostasis.","authors":["Priscila Bertevello","Ana-Paula Teixeira-Gomes","Alexandre Seyer","Anaïs Vitorino Carvalho"],"meta":["October 2018International Journal of Molecular Sciences 19(10):3261","DOI:10.3390/ijms19103261","Project: Lipid metaboslim"],"references":["325942217_Regulation_of_the_meiotic_divisions_of_mammalian_oocytes_and_eggs","325277494_Lipidomic_Components_Alterations_of_Human_Follicular_Fluid_Reveal_the_Relevance_of_Improving_Clinical_Outcomes_in_Women_Using_Progestin-Primed_Ovarian_Stimulation_Compared_to_Short-Term_Protocol","325164200_Extracellular_vesicles_Lipids_as_key_components_of_their_biogenesis_and_functions","323013747_A_Metabolomic_Overview_of_Follicular_Fluid_in_Cows","320960054_Docosahexaenoic_acid_mechanisms_of_action_on_the_bovine_oocyte-cumulus_complex","318336420_LipidMatch_An_automated_workflow_for_rule-based_lipid_identification_using_untargeted_high-resolution_tandem_mass_spectrometry_data","317279163_Fatty_Acid_Binding_Protein_3_And_Transzonal_Projections_Are_Involved_In_Lipid_Accumulation_During_In_Vitro_Maturation_Of_Bovine_Oocytes","317193039_Data_on_endogenous_bovine_ovarian_follicular_cells_peptides_and_small_proteins_obtained_through_Top-down_High_Resolution_Mass_Spectrometry","316808940_Stearoyl-CoA_desaturase_activity_in_bovine_cumulus_cells_protects_the_oocyte_against_saturated_fatty_acid_stress","316072494_Interactions_of_bovine_oocytes_with_follicular_elements_with_respect_to_lipid_metabolism"]}
