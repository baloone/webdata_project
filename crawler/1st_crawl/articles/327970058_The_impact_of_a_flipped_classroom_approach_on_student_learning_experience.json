{"id":"327970058_The_impact_of_a_flipped_classroom_approach_on_student_learning_experience","abstract":"In this paper we report on our evaluation of the impact of a flipped classroom approach on the learning experience of students undertaking an undergraduate biology course. The flipped sessions comprised pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes and in-class group activities in the course design. The success of the approach was evaluated on the basis of perceptions held by the course coordinator and students on how the new course design influenced the student learning experience. Data were collected through a student questionnaire and structured interviews with the course coordinator. Overall, the students reported a high degree of satisfaction with some elements of the flipped approach. However, some activities were less well regarded, with concerns identified by the course coordinator and students. A key finding was that elements from the model for student learning design presented in this article were correlated with student confidence, motivation and engagement. It was concluded that refinements of components of the flipped design, such as the pre-recorded lectures and the structure of the in-class sessions, may further enhance the student learning experience in this course.","authors":["Isaiah T.
