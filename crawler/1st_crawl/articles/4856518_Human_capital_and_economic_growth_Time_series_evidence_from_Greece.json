{"id":"4856518_Human_capital_and_economic_growth_Time_series_evidence_from_Greece","abstract":"This article, examines the relationship between human capital and economic development in Greece. Assuming that the principal institutional mechanism for developing human skills is the formal education, we examine the long-run relationship between educational variables and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as the causal direction between them. Our main result suggests that there exists a cointegrating relationship between education as measured by enrollments rates in primary, secondary, and higher education and the GDP per capita while causality runs through educational variables to economic growth, with the exception of higher education where there exists reverse causality.","authors":["George Myron Agiomirgianakis","Dimitrios Asteriou"],"meta":["February 2001Journal of Policy Modeling 23(5):481-489","DOI:10.1016/S0161-8938(01)00054-0","SourceRePEc"],"references":["244954515_A_contribution_to_the_empiric_of_growth","243644934_Distribution_of_the_Estimators_for_Autoregressive_Time_Series_With_a_Unit_Root","313166184_The_likelihood_ratio_statistics_for_autoregressive_time_series_with_a_unit_root","312946493_On_the_mechanics_of_economic_development'","312915851_Endogenous_Technological_Change","302563453_Likelihood_Ratio_Statistics_for_Autoregressive_Time_Series_with_a_Unit_Root","286281974_Estimation_and_hypothesis_testing_of_cointegration_vectors_in_Gaussian_vector_autoregres-sive_models","285867935_Testing_for_a_Unit_Root_in_Time_Series_Regression","280805949_Threshold_externalities_in_economic_development","273134799_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model"]}
