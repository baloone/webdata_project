{"id":"326896132_Software_Engineering_Process_Models_For_Mobile_App_Development_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Context: An effective development model can help improve competitive advantage and shorten release cycles, which is vital in the fast paced environment of mobile app development. Objective: The aim with this paper is to provide an extensive review of existing mobile app development models. Method: The review is done by following a systematic literature review process. Also presented is an assessment of the usefulness and relevance to industry of the models based on a rigor and relevance framework. Results: 20 primary studies were identified, each with distinct models. Agile methods or state-based principles are commonly adopted across the models. Relatively little effort focuses on deployment, maintenance, project evaluation activities. Conclusion: The review reveals that the contexts in which the identified models are intended to be used vary. This benefits practitioners as they are able to select a model that suits their contexts. However, the usefulness in industry of most of the models, based on the contexts in which the models were evaluated, is questionable. There is a need for evaluating mobile app models in contexts that resemble realistic contexts. The review also calls for further research addressing special constraints of mobile apps, e.g., testing apps on multiple-platforms, user involvement in release planning and continuous deployment.","authors":["Ronald Jabangwe","Henry Edison","Anh Nguyen Duc"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Systems and Software 145","DOI:10.1016/j.jss.2018.08.028"],"references":["342437581_Choosing_a_Mobile_Application_Development_Approach","323704711_Development_of_Mobile_Cloud_Applications_using_UML","309408471_A_Novel_Approach_for_Mobile_Native_App_Development_Using_Ontological_Design","308495821_Weighted_Evaluation_Framework_for_Cross-Platform_App_Development_Approaches","303515568_The_need_for_multivocal_literature_reviews_in_software_engineering_complementing_systematic_literature_reviews_with_grey_literature","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","280924370_Health_Monitoring_and_Management_Using_Internet-of-Things_IoT_Sensing_with_Cloud-Based_Processing_Opportunities_and_Challenges","280014361_Mobile_Software_Ecosystem_MSECO_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","269301609_Mobile_Application_Platform_Heterogeneity_Android_vs_Windows_Phone_vs_iOS_vs_Firefox_OS","261378649_Survey_comparison_and_evaluation_of_cross_platform_mobile_application_development_tools","261150209_Mobile_Development_Process_Spiral","259992054_Considering_Rigor_and_Relevance_when_Evaluating_Test_Driven_Development_A_Systematic_Review","258432559_Software_Development_Processes_for_Mobile_Systems_Is_Agile_Really_Taking_Over_the_Business","258010031_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Cross-platform_Development_Approaches_for_Mobile_Applications","247770109_A_Review_and_Analysis_on_Mobile_Application_Development_Processes_using_Agile_Methodologies","241770392_How_to_be_a_Successful_App_Developer_Lessons_from_the_Simulation_of_an_App_Ecosystem","235981561_Combining_InterMod_Agile_Methodology_with_Usability_Engineering_in_a_Mobile_Application_Development","221560176_Software_engineering_issues_for_mobile_application_development","221322054_Mobile-D_An_Agile_Approach_for_Mobile_Application_Development","221270778_Lessons_from_early_stages_design_of_mobile_applications","4279060_Applying_Systematic_Reviews_to_Diverse_Study_Types_An_Experience_Report","319439580_Augmented_reality_mobile_app_development_for_all","318136011_Process_of_Mobile_Application_Development_from_the_Security_Perspective","315846663_Magni_-_A_Framework_for_Developing_Context-Aware_Mobile_Applications","315066236_A_Development_Technique_for_Mobile_Applications_Program","304552595_Implementation_of_Delivery_Application_Using_a_Development_Method_for_Mobile_Applications","303098988_Belief_evidence_in_empirical_software_engineering","283716587_Mobile_Application_Verification_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","278715978_Mobile_Information_Systems","273394546_Smartphones_Past_Present_and_Future","272374192_Approaches_to_promote_product_quality_within_software_process_improvement_initiatives_A_mapping_study","272020668_Evaluating_Cross-Platform_Development_Approaches_for_Mobile_Applications","271467584_Is_there_a_role_for_Apps_in_the_future_of_Safety_Management","264888784_Empirical_evidence_on_the_link_between_object-oriented_measures_and_external_quality_attributes_a_systematic_literature_review","261048716_SLeSS_A_Scrum_and_Lean_Six_Sigma_Integration_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Sofware_Customization_for_Mobile_Phones","234816087_Scrum_to_support_mobile_application_development_projects_in_a_just-in-time_learning_context","221219192_Comprehensive_Documentation_Made_Agile_-_Experiments_with_RaPiD7_in_Philips","220692151_Mobile_Design_and_Development_-_Practical_concepts_and_techniques_for_creating_mobile_sites_and_web_apps","220474759_An_integrated_product_development_process_for_mobile_software","220449380_Systems_Development_Methodology_for_Mobile_Commerce_Applications_Agile_vs_Traditional","220277895_A_method_for_evaluating_rigor_and_industrial_relevance_of_technology_evaluations","31663591_Software_Engineering_A_Practitioner's_Approach_RJ_Pressman","22310512_The_Measurement_Of_Observer_Agreement_For_Categorical_Data","4372633_Designing_an_agile_methodology_for_mobile_software_development_A_hybrid_method_engineering_approach","4325190_Development_Process_of_Mobile_Application_SW_Based_on_Agile_Methodology"]}
