{"id":"323286582_Succinct_review_on_MAC_protocols_for_wireless_body_area_networks","abstract":"In the past decade, the growth of biomedical sensors has enabled a modernistic generation of wireless sensor networks viz. wireless body area networks (WBAN). These biomedical wireless sensor networks are equipped with tiny and low power body sensors which promise novel uses in healthcare, fitness and entertainment. Managing and controlling of Wireless Body Area Networks are complex and difficult tasks and efficient management of body sensor networks requires media access control protocols for power management. Different types of body sensors generate different types of data traffic, so WBAN requires MAC protocols for communication that are different from the traditional WSN MAC protocols. In this paper we have reviewed various MAC protocols of WBAN being used in healthcare monitoring applications. We have also classified them on the basis of channel access mechanism and baseline wireless standards.","authors":["Deepshikha Deepshikha","S.
