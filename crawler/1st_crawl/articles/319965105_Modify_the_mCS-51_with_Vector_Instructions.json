{"id":"319965105_Modify_the_mCS-51_with_Vector_Instructions","abstract":"Computer architects have always strived to increase the overall\nspeed of processing for the CPUs. utilizing a reserved unused\nmachine code \"A5H\", we can expands the tradition instruction\nset architecture (ISA) for the μCs-51 family, in this paper we\nintroduce modification of internal architecture for the μCs-51\nand their ISA to improve the overall μC performance,\nspecifically we will introduce two innovated vector\ninstructions for the μCs-51 family. The two vector instructions\nexploiting the data manipulation. The first instruction is to\ntransfer a block of data from specific memory locations to any\nother memory locations simultaneously, while the other vector\ninstruction is to obtain the minimum data byte value within a\nblock of data bytes. Also we will supply the modified μC with\npipeline technique for decreasing the total execution time.\nSuch development improves the total performance of the μC\nincluding execution time, and storage ratio.","authors":["Assem Badr"],"meta":["May 2012","Project: Modify the μCS-51 with Vector Instructions"],"references":["319963340_Modify_the_mCS-51_Architecture_to_SIMD_VLIW_and_Superscalar_mC","253858499_Architecture_of_SIMD_Type_Vector_Processor","316698345_The_designer's_Guide_to_VHDL","315495174_Fiber_Optics_Standard_Dictionary","314795296_High-level_modeling_and_FPGA_prototyping_of_microprocessors","264925367_Computer_organization_design_and_architecture_4th_ed","249635771_hardware_support_for_instruction-level_profiling_on_out-of-order_processors","221083985_Balancing_ILP_and_TLP_in_SMT_Architectures_through_Out-of-Order_Instruction_Dispatch","3215549_IPC_Considered_Harmful_for_Multiprocessor_Workloads"]}
