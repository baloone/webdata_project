The field research was methodologically oriented around Action-Research and was conducted between 2015 and 2019 with one hundred and fifty-two (n = 152) students from the higher education in Computer Science courses of two higher education institutions. The students were subjected to the methodological context of the flipped classroom, and the study focused on finding answers around the efficiency and effectiveness of this teaching methodology, by collecting data in two specific approaches, one related to behavioral aspects and the other around students affective aspects, given their individual experience in the teaching and learning process of the flipped classroom.","authors":["Sergio Francisco Sargo Ferreira Lopes","Luis Borges Gouveia","Pedro Reis"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.22161/ijaers.610.3","Project: A metodologia de ensino da sala de aula invertida (Flipped Classroom) no Ã¢mbito do Ensino Superior"],"references":["331337478_Predictive_power_of_regularity_of_pre-class_activities_in_a_flipped_classroom","276106919_Blended_learning_e_as_mudancas_no_ensino_superior_a_proposta_da_sala_de_aula_invertida","255601809_Pesquisa-acao_Uma_introducao_metodologica","274973939_Perceptions_of_the_Internet_and_Education_A_Study_with_Physics_Education_Website_Users"]}
