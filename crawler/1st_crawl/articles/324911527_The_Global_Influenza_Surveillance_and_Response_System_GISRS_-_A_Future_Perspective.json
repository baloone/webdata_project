{"id":"324911527_The_Global_Influenza_Surveillance_and_Response_System_GISRS_-_A_Future_Perspective","abstract":"In the centenary year of the devastating 1918‚Äê19 pandemic, it seems opportune to reflect on the success of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) initiated 70 years ago to provide early warning of changes in influenza viruses circulating in the global population to help mitigate the consequences of such a pandemic and maintain the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines. Three pandemics later and in the face of pandemic threats from highly pathogenic zoonotic infections by different influenza A subtypes it continues to represent a model platform for global collaboration and timely sharing of viruses, reagents and information to forestall and respond to public health emergencies.\nThis article is protected by copyright.
