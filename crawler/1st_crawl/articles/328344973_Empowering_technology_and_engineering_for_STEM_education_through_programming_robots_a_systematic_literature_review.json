{"id":"328344973_Empowering_technology_and_engineering_for_STEM_education_through_programming_robots_a_systematic_literature_review","abstract":"The purpose of this systematic review was (1) to synthesize findings from studies that provided programming experiences through robotics for children, between the ages of zero and eight, and for pre- or in-service teachers, of early childhood education and (2) to reveal the possible contributions of robotics programming for the integration of technology and engineering in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. As a result of search and review processes, 23 research studies were included in the study. These studies were synthesized depending on some common characteristics, such as how they use educational robotics, initial results, subjects and the potential contributions of educational robotics to STEM education, in terms of technology and engineering, were discussed, and some educational implications were also provided. This review revealed that computer programming through robotics can be a promising educational tool and application for the integration of technology and engineering in early childhood STEM education.","authors":["Mustafa Cetin","Ozlen Hasibe Demircan"],"meta":["October 2018Early Child Development and Care 190(2):1-13","DOI:10.1080/03004430.2018.1534844"],"references":["320654915_Student_Adoption_Development_of_Digital_Learning_Media_Action_Research_Recommended_Practices","320637894_Implementing_a_Robotics_Curriculum_in_an_Early_Childhood_Montessori_Classroom","312649091_Dancing_robots_integrating_art_music_and_robotics_in_Singapore's_early_childhood_centers","305418293_A_conceptual_framework_for_integrated_STEM_education","291184103_Robotics_and_Programming_Concepts_in_Early_Childhood_Education_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Designing_Educational_Scenarios","312650472_Educational_Robotics_Intervention_on_Executive_Functions_in_preschool_children_a_pilot_study","308183995_Programming_with_the_KIBO_Robotics_Kit_in_Preschool_Classrooms","308031788_Girls_Boys_and_Bots_Gender_Differences_in_Young_Children's_Performance_on_Robotics_and_Programming_Tasks","295559408_Helping_STEM_take_flight","291036271_Bringing_engineering_to_elementary_school"]}
