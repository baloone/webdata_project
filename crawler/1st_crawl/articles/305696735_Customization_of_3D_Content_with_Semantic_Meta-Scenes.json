{"id":"305696735_Customization_of_3D_Content_with_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","abstract":"Customization of interactive three-dimensional content according to consumers’ requirements is a complex task, as it demands knowledge of such aspects of 3D content as geometry, structure, space, appearance and animation. In this paper, a new method of customizing interactive 3D content is presented. The method leverages semantic web techniques to enable conceptual, generalized representation of 3D content (3D meta-scenes) and on-demand customization of meta-scenes with semantic queries. Query-based content customization with the proposed method can be performed independently by different content consumers at different domain-specific levels of abstraction, with the inference of tacit knowledge. Content customization covers selection of 3D content objects, properties and relations between objects to be presented as well as introduction of new objects, properties and relations. The method has been implemented and evaluated. It significantly improves 3D content customization in comparison to previous approaches.","authors":["Jakub Flotyński","Krzysztof Walczak"],"meta":["July 2016Graphical Models 88","DOI:10.1016/j.gmod.2016.07.001"],"references":["286427583_On-Demand_Generation_of_3D_Content_Based_on_Semantic_Meta-Scenes","281489532_Conceptual_knowledge-based_modeling_of_interactive_3D_content","277675786_Semantic_Representation_of_Multi-platform_3D_Content","275541400_Semantic_Modelling_of_Interactive_3D_Content_with_Domain-specific_Ontologies","262211878_An_Interactive_Approach_to_Semantic_Modeling_of_Indoor_Scenes_with_an_RGBD_Camera","260981484_Enhanced_Decoupling_of_Components_in_Intelligent_Realtime_Interactive_Systems_using_Ontologies","234828916_The_role_of_semantics_in_games_and_simulations","224368444_The_MPEG_Query_Format_Unifying_Access_to_Multimedia_Retrieval_Systems","221608066_Making_sense_of_virtual_environments_Action_representation_grounding_and_common_sense","221470222_3D_Challenges_and_a_Non-In-Depth_Overview_of_Recent_Progress","221466589_SQWRL_a_query_language_for_OWL","221314664_Semantic_modelling_for_virtual_worlds_a_novel_paradigm_for_realtime_interactive_systems","221314654_A_semantic_environment_model_for_crowd_simulation_in_multilayered_complex_environment","221269532_Conceptual_Modeling_for_Virtual_Reality","221011037_Using_the_AMACONT_architecture_for_flexible_adaptation_of_3D_web_applications","221010951_Structured_design_of_interactive_VR_applications","221010901_Remote_scientific_visualization_of_progressive_3D_meshes_with_X3D","220786047_A_Semantic_Web_Environment_for_Digital_Shapes_Understanding","220737747_A_Tourism_Information_System_for_Rural_Areas_Based_on_a_Multi_Platform_Concept","37446111_An_ontology_of_virtual_humans_IIncorporating_semantics_into_human_shapes","306202835_The_mpeg_query_format_Unifying_access_to_multimedia_retrieval_systems","300789375_Ontology-Based_Creation_of_3D_Content_in_a_Service-Oriented_Environment","268471268_Definition_and_Implementation_of_Temporal_Operators_for_a_4D_Query_Language","268192388_Batch_modeling_of_3D_city_based_on_ESRI_cityengine","264669705_Smart_Variations_Functional_Substructures_for_Part_Compatibility","262329451_Semantic_3D_Media_and_Content_Semantics_and_3D_media_Current_issues_and_perspectives","262234556_Attribit_Content_Creation_with_Semantic_Attributes","261155898_Semantic_multi-layered_design_of_interactive_3D_presentations","256913530_Tribological_behavior_of_textured_cemented_carbide_filled_with_solid_lubricants_in_dry_sliding_with_titanium_alloys","230688583_Describing_Interactivity_of_3D_Content","225220880_Multiplatform_Real-Time_Rendering_of_MPEG-4_3D_Scenes_with_Microsoft_XNA","224396645_3D_Media_and_the_Semantic_Web","222818787_Characterization_of_3D_shape_parts_for_semantic_annotation","221011083_Semantic_description_of_3D_environments_A_proposal_based_on_web_standards","221010895_Semantic-based_rules_for_3D_scene_adaptation","220067006_Platform_independent_optimisation_of_multi-resolution_3D_content_to_enable_universal_media_access","4356626_Flex-VR_Configurable_3D_web_applications"]}
