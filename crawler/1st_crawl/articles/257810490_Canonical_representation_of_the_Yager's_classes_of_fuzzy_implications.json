{"id":"257810490_Canonical_representation_of_the_Yager's_classes_of_fuzzy_implications","abstract":"The aim of this work is to study an interval extension of the Yagerâ€™s classes of implications based on the canonical constructor. Focused on the Yager implication, such construction preserves similar and extra properties of fuzzy implications, also aggregating the correctness and optimality criteria.","authors":["Renata Hax Sander Reiser","Benjamin Bedregal","Regivan H N Santiago","M.
