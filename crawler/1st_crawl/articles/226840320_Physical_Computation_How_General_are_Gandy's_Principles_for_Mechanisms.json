{"id":"226840320_Physical_Computation_How_General_are_Gandy's_Principles_for_Mechanisms","abstract":"What are the limits of physical computation? In his ‘Church’s Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms’, Turing’s student Robin\nGandy proved that any machine satisfying four idealised physical ‘principles’ is equivalent to some Turing machine. Gandy’s\nfour principles in effect define a class of computing machines (‘Gandy machines’). Our question is: What is the relationship\nof this class to the class of all (ideal) physical computing machines? Gandy himself suggests that the relationship is identity.\nWe do not share this view. We will point to interesting examples of (ideal) physical machines that fall outside the class\nof Gandy machines and compute functions that are not Turing-machine computable.","authors":["B.
