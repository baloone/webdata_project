Increasing demand for CO2\nconsumption has urged construction companies and decision makers to consider ecological efficiency affected by CO2\nconsumption. Therefore, this research aims at developing a method capable of analyzing and assessing the Ecoefficiency determining factor in Iranâ€™s 22 local cement companies over 2015-2019.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: This research utilizes two well-known artificial intelligence approaches, namely\noptimization Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and machine learning algorithms at the first and second steps\nrespectively to fulfill the research aim. Meanwhile, to find the superior model, CCR model, BBC model, and additive\nDEA models to measure the efficiency of decision processes are used. A proportional decreasing or increasing of\ninputs/outputs is the main concern in measuring efficiency which neglect slacks and hence, is a critical limitation of\nradial models. Thus, additive model by considering desirable and undesirable outputs, as a well-known DEA nonproportional and non-radial model, are utilized to solve the problem. Additive models measure efficiency via slack\nvariables. Considering both input-oriented and output-oriented is one of the main advantages of additive model. In\naddition, as a non-radial model, when dealing with undesirable outputs, slacks in undesirable outputs are accounted\nfor the efficiency measure.\nFindings and Implications: After applying the proposed model, the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is computed\nto evaluate the productivity of companies over 2015-2019. Although DEA is an appreciated method for evaluating, it\nfails to extract unknown information. Thus, machine learning algorithms plays an important role at this step.\nAssociation rules is used to extract hidden rules, and to introduce the three strongest rules. Finally, three data mining\nclassification algorithms in three different tools have been applied to introduce the superior algorithm and tool. This\nmodel is proposed to fix the efficiency of a two-stage process and prevent the dependency on various weights.\nConverting undesirable outputs, and desirable inputs to final desirable inputs in a single-stage model to minimize\ninputs as well as turning desirable outputs to final desirable outputs in the single stage model to maximize outputs to\nhave a positive effect on the efficiency of the whole process. Decreasing pollutant material investment, as well as energy\nconsumption (inputs of the single proposed model) and increasing waste material removed as well as cement\nproduction (outputs of the unique proposed model) have a positive influence on profits, and efficiency of cement\ncompanies.\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligent; Machine learning; Optim","authors":["Mirpouya Mirmozaffari","Elham Shadkam","Seyed Mohammad Khalili","Kamyar Kabirifar"],"meta":["March 2021International Journal of Energy Sector Management","DOI:10.1108/IJESM-02-2020-0003"],"references":["346170734_Ranking_of_Factors_Affecting_the_Implementation_of_Knowledge_Management_Engineering_Based_on_TOPSIS_Technique","346081432_SBM_Model_Based_Productivity_Evaluation","346050563_Productivity_Evaluation_for_Banking_System_in_Developing_Countries_DEA_Malmquist_Productivity_Index_Based_on_CCR_BCC_CCR-BCC_A_Case_Study","346050147_Filtering_in_Image_Processing","345346059_Enhancing_evacuation_response_to_extreme_weather_disasters_using_public_transportation_systems_A_novel_simheuristic_approach","343300055_A_Novel_Machine_Learning_Approach_Combined_with_Optimization_Models_for_Eco-Efficiency_Evaluation","343144613_Adaptive_Wavelet_Based_MRI_Brain_Image_De-noising","346050162_Eco-efficiency_Evaluation_in_Cement_Industries_DEA_Malmquist_Productivity_Index_Using_Optimization_Models","344333669_Improving_Construction_and_Demolition_Waste_Collection_Service_in_an_Urban_Area_Using_a_Simheuristic_Approach_A_Case_Study_in_Sydney_Australia","343809918_Artificial_neural_network_model_to_predict_the_compressive_strength_of_eco-friendly_geopolymer_concrete_incorporating_silica_fume_and_natural_zeolite"]}
