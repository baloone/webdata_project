{"id":"279748406_Towards_Automatic_Poetry_Generation_using_Constraint_Handling_Rules","abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the incremental implementation of an autonomous system, capable of generating unique yet meaningful poetry, using Constraint Handling Rules. The system consists of a reasoner, which is responsible for ensuring the grammaticality, poeticness and meaningfulness of the resulting poems, without depending on any external corpora. This is achieved, by incrementally pruning a customized lexicon, to satisfy the constraints enforced by the three modules, until an output poem is produced.","authors":["Slim Abdennadher","Alia el Bolock"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1145/2695664.2695742","Conference: The 30th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing (SAC 2015), 2015.At: Salamanca, Spain"],"references":["288288388_Computational_modelling_of_poetry_generation","277295838_An_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Approach_to_Poetry_Generation","254558843_Corpus-based_generation_of_content_and_form_in_poetry","229024260_Automatic_generation_of_poetry_using_a_CBR_approach","228610670_Automatic_generation_of_poetry_an_overview","222905535_Theory_and_practice_of_constraint_handling_rules","220080332_Using_genetic_algorithms_to_create_meaningful_poetic_text","31231744_WALKER'S_PRONOUNCING_DICTIONARY","2888803_Automatic_Generation_of_Poetry_using_a_CBR_Approach"]}
