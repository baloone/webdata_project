{"id":"316042414_Translation_Patterns_at_Term_Level_A_corpus-based_analysis_in_the_specialised_language_of_ICT","abstract":"This book is both an in-depth study in the field of terminology and specialised translation and a practical demonstration of how corpus linguistics and its tools may be used in translation-related research. Advancing an interdisciplinary methodology that combines concepts and principles from several fields of study, it is, to our knowledge, the first applied analysis of this kind to use a parallel corpus of texts translated from English into Romanian (275 text pairs) and the first to propose a detailed taxonomy not only of Romanian information technology terms but also of the regularities and norms that govern their transfer from English into this language. Meant to be read by translation researchers and students as well as actual translators interested in this field, the volume discusses several important theoretical ideas relative to specialised translation and communication, corpora, corpus linguistics, and terminology while providing a wealth of methodological and linguistic examples taken from actual texts. In order to encourage readers to apply the notions discussed in their own work, each chapter ends with conclusions and suggestions for further research.","authors":["Sorina Ciobanu"],"meta":["January 2017","Publisher: Institutul EuropeanISBN: 978-606-24-0179-5","Project: Corpus-based Specialised Translation Studies"],"references":[]}
