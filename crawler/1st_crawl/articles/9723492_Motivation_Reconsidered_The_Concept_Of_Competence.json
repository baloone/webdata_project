{"id":"9723492_Motivation_Reconsidered_The_Concept_Of_Competence","abstract":"Theories of motivation built upon primary drives cannot account for playful and exploratory behavior. The new motivational concept of \"competence\" is introduced indicating the biological significance of such behavior. It furthers the learning process of effective interaction with the environment. While the purpose is not known to animal or child, an intrinsic need to deal with the environment seems to exist and satisfaction (\"the feeling of efficacy\") is derived from it. (100 ref.)
