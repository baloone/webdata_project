{"id":"234066608_Short_Lists_with_Short_Programs_in_Short_Time","abstract":"Given a machine U, a c-short program for x is a string p such that U(p)=x and\nthe length of p is bounded by c + (the length of a shortest program for x). We\nshow that for any universal machine, it is possible to compute in polynomial\ntime on input x a list of polynomial size guaranteed to contain a\nO(log|x|)-short program for x. We also show that there exist computable\nfunctions that map every x to a list of size O(|x|^2) containing a O(1)-short\nprogram for x and this is essentially optimal because we prove that such a list\nmust have size O(|x|^2) . Finally we show that for some machines, computable\nlists containing a shortest program must have length Omega(2^|x|) .","authors":["Bruno Bauwens","Anton Makhlin","Nikolay Vereshchagin","Marius Zimand"],"meta":["January 2013Proceedings of the Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2013.19","SourcearXiv"],"references":["292334872_Computability_in_statistical_hypotheses_testing_and_characterizations_of_independence_and_directed_influences_in_time_series_using_Kolmogorov_complexity","284090758_On_the_symmetry_of_algorithmic_information","262206241_Complexity_of_Complexity_and_Maximal_Plain_versus_Prefix-Free_Kolmogorov_Complexity","247048942_On_the_symmetry_of_algorithmic_information","225941594_Improving_the_Space-Bounded_Version_of_Muchnik's_Conditional_Complexity_Theorem_via_Naive_Derandomization","267054521_Generating_Kolmogorov_random_strings_from_sources_with_limited_independence","255593989_Kolmogorov_complexity_and_games","247022519_On_Some_Games_Which_Are_Relevant_to_the_Theory_of_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets","233982201_Short_lists_for_shortest_descriptions_in_short_time","225869950_On_Representatives_of_Subsets"]}
