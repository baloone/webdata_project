{"id":"225213719_Foundational_choices_in_DOLCE","abstract":"Foundational ontologies are ontologies that have a large scope, can be highly reusable in different modeling scenarios, are\nphilosophically and conceptually well founded, and are semantically transparent.\n\nAfter the analysis and comparison of alternative theories on general notions like ‘having a property’, ‘being in time’ and\n‘change through time’, this paper shows how specific elements of these theories can be coherently integrated into a foundational\nontology. The ontology is here proposed as an improvement of the core elements of the ontology dolce and is thus called dolce-core.","authors":["Stefano Borgo","Claudio Masolo"],"meta":["May 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_16","In book: Handbook on Ontologies (pp.361-381)"],"references":["245584936_WonderWeb_Deliverable_D18_Ontology_Library","344485011_A_World_of_States_of_Affairs","324357738_Parts_A_Study_in_Ontology","274417340_Four-Dimensionalism","273355645_Endurance_and_Indiscernibility","270375985_Parts_A_Study_in_Ontology","261779291_Determinables_as_Universals","246997655_On_Being_Spread_Out_in_Time_Temporal_Parts_and_the_Problem_of_Change","245352318_An_Ontology_of_Persistence_and_Time","243784747_How_to_Exist_at_a_Time_When_You_Have_No_Temporal_Parts"]}
