{"id":"348616289_Multilevel_Approaches_for_the_Critical_Node_Problem","abstract":"Multilevel programming can provide the right mathematical formulations for modeling sequential decision-making problems. In such cases, it is implicit that each level anticipates the optimal reaction of the subsequent ones. Defender–attacker–defender trilevel programs are a particular case of interest that encompasses a fortification strategy, followed by an attack, and a consequent recovery defensive strategy. In “Multilevel Approaches for the Critical Node Problem,” Baggio, Carvalho, Lodi, and Tramontani study a combinatorial sequential game between a defender and an attacker that takes place in a network. The authors propose an exact algorithmic framework. This work highlights the significant improvements that the defender can achieve by taking the three-stage game into account instead of considering fortification and recovery as isolated. Simultaneously, the paper contributes to advancing the methodologies for solving trilevel programs.","authors":["Andrea Baggio","Margarida Carvalho","Andrea Lodi","Andrea Tramontani"],"meta":["January 2021Operations Research 69(2)","DOI:10.1287/opre.2020.2014"],"references":["332688686_Interdiction_Games_and_Monotonicity_with_Application_to_Knapsack_Problems","324458849_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Geometric_Firefighter_and_Budget_Fence_Problems","319893031_A_New_General-Purpose_Algorithm_for_Mixed-Integer_Bilevel_Linear_Programs","319861239_On_the_use_of_intersection_cuts_for_bilevel_optimization","318981549_Fake_News_Detection_on_Social_Media_A_Data_Mining_Perspective","303515066_Intersection_Cuts_for_Bilevel_Optimization","269080456_Solving_Defender-Attacker-Defender_Models_for_Infrastructure_Defense","265078955_INTERDICTION_AND_DISCRETE_BILEVEL_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING","259634403_A_cutting-plane_algorithm_for_solving_a_weighted_influence_interdiction_problem","250956647_A_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithm_for_the_Bilevel_Programming_Problem","240320608_The_Mixed_Integer_Linear_Bilevel_Programming_Problem","233812576_New_Branch-and-Bound_Rules_for_Bilevel_Linear_Programming","233367457_Models_for_nuclear_smuggling_interdiction","228703232_Simultaneous_column-and-row_generation_for_large-scale_linear_programs_with_column-dependent-rows","226010741_A_Branch-and-cut_Algorithm_for_Integer_Bilevel_Linear_Programs","224375766_Worst-Case_Interdiction_Analysis_of_Large-Scale_Electric_Power_Grids","221297912_Detecting_and_Tracking_Political_Abuse_in_Social_Media","220846842_Social_spam_detection","220413080_Optimal_Allocation_of_Protective_Resources_in_Shortest-Path_Networks","220249920_Defending_Critical_Infrastructure","321137237_The_Network_Data_Repository_with_Interactive_Graph_Analytics_and_Visualization","312013530_A_Backward_Sampling_Framework_for_Interdiction_Problems_with_Fortification","308820007_An_O1-Approximation_for_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Interdiction","301719364_A_mixed-integer_bilevel_programming_approach_for_a_competitive_prioritized_set_covering_problem","301201835_Bilevel_Knapsack_with_Interdiction_Constraints","280773042_An_O1-Approximation_for_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Interdiction","277609909_Enhanced_exact_algorithms_for_discrete_bilevel_linear_problems","268162523_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Geometric_Firefighter_and_Budget_Fence_Problems","265226266_The_Firefighter_Problem_A_survey_of_results_directions_and_questions","264674045_Connectivity_interdiction","262175450_Identifying_critical_nodes_in_undirected_graphs_Complexity_results_and_polynomial_algorithms_for_the_case_of_bounded_treewidth","262152918_Polynomial-time_algorithms_for_solving_a_class_of_critical_node_problems_on_trees_and_series-parallel_graphs","261845859_Packing_Interdiction_and_Partial_Covering_Problems","257658043_One-level_reformulation_of_the_bilevel_Knapsack_problem_using_dynamic_programming","257658037_Exact_interdiction_models_and_algorithms_for_disconnecting_networks_via_node_deletions","249937171_Algorithms_for_discrete_and_continuous_multicommodity_flow_network_interdiction_problems","245122512_Deterministic_Network_Interdiction","227867017_Optimal_interdiction_policy_for_a_flow_network","227444276_Finding_the_n_Most_Vital_Links_in_Flow_Networks","226200698_The_Bilevel_Programming_Problem_Reformulations_Constraint_Qualifications_and_Optimality_Conditions","225842209_Computability_of_global_solutions_to_factorable_nonconvex_programs_Part_I-Convex_underestimating_problems","225672173_Survivable_network_design_under_optimal_and_heuristic_interdiction_scenarios","224922206_Identifying_Critical_Infrastructure_The_Median_and_Covering_Facility_Interdiction_Problems","223470184_An_exact_solution_approach_for_the_interdiction_median_problem_with_fortification","223258629_A_Bilevel_Mixed-Integer_Program_for_Critical_Infrastructure_Protection_Planning","223008239_Finding_the_most_vital_arcs_in_a_network","222637395_Increasing_the_Weight_of_Minimum_Spanning_Trees","221591679_Network_inhibition_problem","220567981_The_most_vital_nodes_with_respect_to_independent_set_and_vertex_cover","220471260_Complexity_of_the_critical_node_problem_over_trees","47842508_On_Short_Paths_Interdiction_Problems_Total_and_Node-Wise_Limited_Interdiction","220209156_Shortest-Path_Network_Interdiction","31593000_0-1_Reformulations_of_the_Multicommodity_Capacitated_Network_Design_Problem","20035536_A_network_interdiction_model_for_hospital_infection_control","1920535_Matching_Interdiction"]}
