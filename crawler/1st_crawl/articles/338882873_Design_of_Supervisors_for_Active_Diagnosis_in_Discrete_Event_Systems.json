{"id":"338882873_Design_of_Supervisors_for_Active_Diagnosis_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","abstract":"In this article, we present an active diagnosis method to enhance diagnosability of a plant modeled by a finite-state automaton. Some properties of active diagnosis and silent blocking are studied. To avoid silent blocking, the notion of \n$stop$ \n-free event set is proposed, and a \n$stop$ \n-free control policy that does not introduce silent blocking is formulated. We develop a heuristic method based on the verifier of the plant to compute a feasible \n$stop$ \n-free event set that guarantees the existence of a valid control policy. With the \n$stop$ \n-free event set, the set of disabled edges is computed, and an online control policy that is based on the current diagnostic state is computed, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is diagnosable. The structural complexity of the proposed control structure is polynomial with respect to the number of states of the plant.","authors":["Yihui Hu","Ziyue Ma","Zhiwu Li"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2020.2970011"],"references":["336425331_Diagnosability_of_Vector_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Predicates","335357780_On_Algebraic_Identification_of_Critical_States_for_Deadlock_Control_in_Automated_Manufacturing_Systems_Modeled_With_Petri_Nets","316598750_On_Scalable_Supervisory_Control_of_Multi-Agent_Discrete-Event_Systems","311716483_Synthesis_of_Maximally-Permissive_Supervisors_for_the_Range_Control_Problem","304411054_Active_diagnosis_with_observable_quiescence","283672289_Codiagnosability_and_coobservability_under_dynamic_observations_Transformation_and_verification","282426709_A_Uniform_Approach_for_Synthesizing_Property-Enforcing_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","271425289_Polynomial_time_verification_of_decentralized_diagnosability_of_discrete_event_systems","267464271_Active_Diagnosis_for_Probabilistic_Systems","262158760_IOS_Press_Fault_Diagnosis_with_Static_and_Dynamic_Observers","260711455_Diagnosability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Labeled_Petri_Nets","260661823_A_New_Approach_for_Diagnosability_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_Using_Verifier_Nets","260652479_Diagnosis_Using_Labeled_Petri_Nets_With_Silent_or_Undistinguishable_Fault_Events","239482725_Control_of_discrete_event_system","225690497_Active_Acquisition_of_Information_for_Diagnosis_and_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","224177144_Sensor_configuration_selection_for_discrete-event_systems_under_unreliable_observations","216813077_Introduction_to_Discrete_Event_Systems","30845831_On_an_Optimization_Problem_in_Sensor_Selection","3792918_Fault_diagnosis_in_discrete-event_systems_Framework_and_model_reduction","3032303_Algebraic_approaches_for_fault_identification_in_discrete-event_systems","3022357_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","2370706_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Testing_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","332860799_An_Approach_to_Improve_Permissiveness_of_Supervisors_for_GMECs_in_Time_Petri_Net_Systems","328086132_Enforcement_of_Diagnosability_in_Labeled_Petri_Nets_via_Optimal_Sensor_Selection","319223294_Codiagnosability_Analysis_of_Bounded_Petri_Nets","316629329_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_updated_20170501","304530654_Optimal_Constructions_for_Active_Diagnosis","271479222_Active_Diagnosis_of_Deterministic_IO_Automata","262244745_Optimal_sensor_selection_for_ensuring_diagnosability_in_labeled_bounded_Petri_Nets","261648055_M_-controllable_subpredicates_arising_in_state_feed_back_control_of_discrete_event_systems","256660820_Robust_diagnosis_of_discrete_event_systems_against_intermittent_loss_of_observations","255629538_Monitoring_and_Active_Diagnosis_for_Discrete-Event_Systems","222645987_Fault_detection_for_discrete_event_systems_using_Petri_nets_with_unobservable_transitions","3024475_Polynomial-time_verification_of_diagnosability_of_partially_observed_discrete-event_systems","3023073_Active_diagnosis_of_discrete-event_systems"]}
