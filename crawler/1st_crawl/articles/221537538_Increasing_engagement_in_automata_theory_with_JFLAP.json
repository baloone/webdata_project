{"id":"221537538_Increasing_engagement_in_automata_theory_with_JFLAP","abstract":"We describe the results from a two-year study with fourteen universities on presenting formal languages in a more visual, interactive and applied manner using JFLAP. In our results the majority of students felt that having access to JFLAP made learning course concepts easier, made them feel more engaged in the course and made the course more enjoyable. We also describe changes and additions to JFLAP we have made based on feedback from users. These changes include new algorithms such as a CYK parser and a user-controlled parser, and new resources that include a JFLAP online tu- torial, a wiki and a listserv.","authors":["Susan H.
