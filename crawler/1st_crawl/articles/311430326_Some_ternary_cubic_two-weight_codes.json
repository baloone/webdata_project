{"id":"311430326_Some_ternary_cubic_two-weight_codes","abstract":"We study trace codes with defining set $L,$ a subgroup of the multiplicative group of an extension of degree $m$ of the alphabet ring $\\mathbb{F}_3+u\\mathbb{F}_3+u^{2}\\mathbb{F}_{3},$ with $u^{3}=1.$ These codes are abelian, and their ternary images are quasi-cyclic of co-index three (a.k.a. cubic codes). Their Lee weight distributions are computed by using Gauss sums. These codes have three nonzero weights when $m$ is singly-even and $|L|=\\frac{3^{3m}-3^{2m}}{2}.$ When $m$ is odd, and $|L|=\\frac{3^{3m}-3^{2m}}{2}$, or $|L|={3^{3m}-3^{2m}}$ and $m$ is a positive integer, we obtain two new infinite families of two-weight codes which are optimal. Applications of the image codes to secret sharing schemes are also given.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Daitao Huang","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["December 2016Chinese Journal of Electronics 27(4)","DOI:10.1049/cje.2018.04.010","Project: pseudo random sequences over rings"],"references":["335832810_Optimal_Two-Weight_Codes_From_Trace_Codes_Over_F2uF2","311430273_Optimal_two_weight_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_chain_ring","282970648_Linear_codes_over_mathbbm_F_3umathbbm_F_3u2mathbbm_F_3_F_3_u_F_3_u_2_F_3_MacWilliams_identities_optimal_ternary_codes_from_one-Lee_weight_codes_and_two-Lee_weight_codes","274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","256097390_Five_Families_of_Three-Weight_Ternary_Cyclic_Codes_and_Their_Duals","312236880_Optimal_binary_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_non-chain_ring","309078509_Two_and_three_weight_codes_over_FpuFp","282425275_Three-weight_cyclic_codes_and_their_weight_distributions","267659770_Three-weight_codes_and_association_schemes","256441213_Optimal_Ternary_Cyclic_Codes_with_Minimum_Distance_Four_and_Five"]}
