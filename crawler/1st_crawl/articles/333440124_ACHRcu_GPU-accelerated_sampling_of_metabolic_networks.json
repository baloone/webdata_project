{"id":"333440124_ACHRcu_GPU-accelerated_sampling_of_metabolic_networks","abstract":"ACHR.cu is a General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GP-GPU) implementation of the popular sampling algorithm of metabolic models ACHR.\nSampling is the tool of choice in metabolic modeling in unbiased analysis as it allows to explore the solution space constrained by the linear bounds without necessarily assuming an objective function. As metabolic models grow in size to represent communities of bacteria and complex human tissues, sampling became less used because of the large analysis time. With ACHR.cu we can achieve at least a speed up of 10x in the sampling process.","authors":["Marouen Ben Guebila"],"meta":["May 2019The Journal of Open Source Software 4(37):1363","DOI:10.21105/joss.01363"],"references":["328255928_Dynamic_load_balancing_enables_large-scale_flux_variability_analysis","320344927_Creation_and_analysis_of_biochemical_constraint-based_models_the_COBRA_Toolbox_v30","317000661_Simultaneous_Solving_of_Linear_Programming_Problems_in_GPU","262223075_Management_of_an_academic_HPC_cluster_The_UL_experience","260254555_optGpSampler_An_Improved_Tool_for_Uniformly_Sampling_the_Solution-Space_of_Genome-Scale_Metabolic_Networks","345465345_Simultaneous_Solving_of_Batched_Linear_Programs_on_a_GPU","330273804_Two-Dimensional_Batch_Linear_Programming_on_the_GPU","277080325_Using_Genome-Scale_Models_to_Predict_Biological_Capabilities","270691384_Reconstruction_and_Use_of_Microbial_Metabolic_Networks_the_Core_Escherichia_coli_Metabolic_Model_as_an_Educational_Guide","255649541_Direction_Choice_for_Accelerated_Convergence_in_Hit-and-Run_Sampling"]}
