{"id":"301362113_On_the_Implementation_of_an_Interior-Point_Filter_Line-Search_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Nonlinear_Programming","abstract":"We present a primal-dual interior-point algorithm with a lter line-search method for non- linear programming. Local and global convergence properties of this method were analyzed in previous work. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the fea- sibility restoration phase for the lter method, second-order corrections, and inertia correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlin- ear programming.","authors":["Andreas WÃ¤chter","Lorenz T.
