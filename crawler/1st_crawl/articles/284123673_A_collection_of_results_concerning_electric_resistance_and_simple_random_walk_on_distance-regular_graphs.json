{"id":"284123673_A_collection_of_results_concerning_electric_resistance_and_simple_random_walk_on_distance-regular_graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we prove a number of related results on distance-regular graphs concerning electric resistance and simple random walk. We begin by proving several results on electric resistance; in particular we prove a sharp constant bounding the ratio of electrical resistances between any two pairs of points and give a counterexample to a conjecture made in a previous paper regarding the growth of resistances with respect to distance. We then show how a number of strong bounds on moments of hitting times, cover times, and related quantities for simple random walk may be deduced from the bound on resistance.","authors":["Jack Koolen","Greg Markowsky"],"meta":["February 2016Discrete Mathematics 339(2):737-744","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2015.10.012"],"references":["227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","257012799_On_partial_sums_of_hitting_times","245245752_Algebraic_Potential_Theory_on_Graphs","241078804_Distance-regular_graphs_with_a_1_or_c_2_at_least_half_the_valency","231885553_Potential_Theory_on_Distance-Regular_Graphs","229676545_Random_walks_on_regular_polyhedra_and_other_distance-regular_graphs","227183519_Random_walks_on_highly_symmetric_graphs","50378405_On_electric_resistances_for_distance-regular_graphs","38361191_Covering_Problems_for_Brownian_Motion_on_Spheres","2647226_A_Tight_Lower_Bound_on_the_Cover_Time_for_Random_Walks_on_Graphs"]}
