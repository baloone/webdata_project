{"id":"251387731_M_-valued_Sets_and_Sheaves_over_Integral_Commutative_CL-Monoids","abstract":"The concept of Heyting algebra valued sets is intrinsically linked to intuitionistic models, sheaves and topos theory. Precursors\nof these ideas appear already in D. S. Scott’s and R. Solovay’s work on Boolean-valued models from the mid-sixties [Scott\n1967]. Subsequently D. Higgs uses Boolean-valued sets in his unpublished, but widely circulated paper [Higgs 1973] and demonstrates\nthat the category of sheaves over a complete Boolean algebra B is equivalent to the category of B-valued sets and maps in\nthe original Scott-Solovay sense. The concept of Heyting algebra valued sets and its relationship to intuitionistic logic \nhas been extensively studied by M. Fourman and D. S. Scott in their contributions to the Research Symposium on Applications of Sheaf Theory Durham, NC, 1977 [Fourman and Scott 1979; Scott 1979]. We can summarize the situation as follows: let Ω be a complete Heyting\nalgebra; then 1° Ω-valued sets are intuitionistic models of the formalized mathematical theory of identity with existence\npredicate, and 2° the category sh(Ω) of sheaves over Ω forms a topos. In this context we mention explicitly the fact that\nthe unique classification of subobjects in sh (Ω) depends essentially on the existence of non-trivial objects with local support.","authors":["U.
