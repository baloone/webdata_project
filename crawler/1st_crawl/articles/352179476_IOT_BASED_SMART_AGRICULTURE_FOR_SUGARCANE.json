{"id":"352179476_IOT_BASED_SMART_AGRICULTURE_FOR_SUGARCANE","abstract":"Agriculture is practiced on a large scale in India and its contribution is also maximum in the Indian economy. The traditional farming practices like dependency on monsoon, poor infrastructure and less usage of technology has affected agricultural sector. In this paper we have demonstrated IOT based smart agriculture model for sugarcane. The aim of this system is to help the farmer to take right decision, demonstrate intelligence of smart agricultural system based on IOT which helps in taking decisions for watering and whether to do liming or give gypsum based on continuous monitoring and also provide water when the farm is dry without the presence of human. Here soil and environment properties are sensed by using soil moisture sensor, soil pH sensor, soil temperature sensor, DHT11 (humidity and temperature sensor) and periodically sent to cloud through IOT. Cloud storage stores continuously the details of these parameters. Analysis on the cloud data is done through IOT based system. Analysis like, if the values of the sensor goes beyond or below the threshold values required for sugarcane set by the farmer, based on the analysis motor is turned on or off and proper suggestions are sent through SMS to the farmer. This model will help the farmer to take right decision and avoids wastage of water in irrigation process.","authors":["Kaveri S Kamble","Mahender Nakrani","Devendra L Bhuyar"],"meta":["June 2019"],"references":["326199083_Smart_farming_system_using_sensors_for_agricultural_task_automation","329070950_IOT_Based_Smart_Agriculture_System","327933653_IoT_Based_Smart_Agricultural_Device_Controlling_System","326073308_IoT_based_smart_crop-field_monitoring_and_automation_irrigation_system","317929070_A_model_for_smart_agriculture_using_IoT","305649495_A_control_system_in_an_intelligent_farming_by_using_arduino_technology"]}
