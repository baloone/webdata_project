{"id":"234516779_Counterfactual_quantum_key_distribution_with_high_efficiency","abstract":"In a counterfactual quantum key distribution scheme, a secret key can be\ngenerated merely by transmitting the split vacuum pulses of single\nparticles. We improve the efficiency of the first quantum key\ndistribution scheme based on the counterfactual phenomenon. This scheme\nnot only achieves the same security level as the original one but also\nhas higher efficiency. We also analyze how to achieve the optimal\nefficiency under various conditions.","authors":["Ying Sun","Qiao-Yan Wen"],"meta":["October 2010Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 82(5):52318","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.82.052318"],"references":["225149717_Efficient_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Scheme_And_Proof_of_Its_Unconditional_Security","5852031_Coherent_Optical_Phase_Transfer_over_a_32-km_Fiber_with_1_s_Instability_at_10_-_17","2795018_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Orthogonal_States","2204498_High-Efficiency_Quantum_Interrogation_Measurements_via_the_Quantum_Zeno_Effect","2202919_Optimal_Eavesdropping_in_Quantum_Cryptography_with_Six_States","2071710_Quantum_Mechanical_Interaction-Free_Measurements","1901876_Phase-noise_measurements_in_long-fiber_interferometers_for_quantum-repeater_applications","243473844_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Split_Transmission_of_One-Bit_Information_in_Two_Steps","235584116_Two-way_protocols_for_quantum_cryptography_with_a_nonmaximally_entangled_qubit_pair","235475800_Robust_variations_of_the_Bennett-Brassard_1984_protocol_against_collective_noise","234782642_Conjugate_Coding","231049422_Interaction-free_measurement_based_on_nonclassical_fourth-order_interference","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","43050905_Stabilization_of_a_long-armed_fiber-optic_single-photon_interferometer","43021195_Counterfactual_Quantum_Cryptography","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","7670796_Beating_the_Photon-Number-Splitting_Attack_in_Practical_Quantum_Cryptography","7567967_Lower_and_Upper_Bounds_on_the_Secret-Key_Rate_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocols_Using_One-Way_Classical_Communication","6768992_From_Bell's_Theorem_to_Secure_Quantum_Key_Distribution","2202702_No_Cloning_of_Orthogonal_States_in_Composite_Systems","2195916_Reduced_randomness_in_quantum_cryptography_with_sequences_of_qubits_encoded_in_the_same_basis"]}
