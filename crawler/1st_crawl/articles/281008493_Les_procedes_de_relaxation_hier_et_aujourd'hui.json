{"id":"281008493_Les_procedes_de_relaxation_hier_et_aujourd'hui","abstract":"The processes of relaxation past and present\nRelaxation permits to modify previous experience by controlling muscle tone. It provides deep rest and, in cases of exhaustion, promotes rapid recovery. It also helps control emotions and reduces anxiety. The processes used to influence muscle tone are varied: i.e. Jacobsonâ€™s exercises which seek to increase proprioception sensitivity in order to identify and remove residual muscle tone, and autogenic training used to produce, by autosuggestion, the physiological effects of hypnosis. However, the ancestral process induced serenity by passive repetition of a prayer, i.e. the case in the Christian west, in Islam the dhikr or invocation for the remembrance of God, in the East the nemboutsou in Japan and yoga currently used in transcendental meditation. This relaxation process can be separated from the mystical approach where it easily fits in and is open to beginners as an easy way towards relaxation.","authors":["Michel Larroque"],"meta":["January 2013L'Information psychiatrique 89(9):751","DOI:10.3917/inpsy.8909.0751"],"references":[]}
