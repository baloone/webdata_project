{"id":"268878643_A_Direct_PCA-Based_Approach_for_Real-Time_Description_of_Physiological_Organ_Deformations","abstract":"Dynamic MR-imaging can provide functional and positional information in real-time, which can be conveniently used on-line to control a cancer therapy, e.g. using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound or Radio Therapy. However, a precise realtime correction for motion is fundamental in abdominal organs to ensure an optimal treatment dose associated with a limited toxicity in nearby organs at risk. This paper proposes a real-time direct PCA-based technique which offers a robust approach for motion estimation of abdominal organs and allows correcting motion related artifacts. The PCA was used to detect spatio-temporal coherences of the periodic organ motion in a learning step. During the interventional procedure, physiological contributions were characterized quantitatively using a small set of parameters. A coarse-to-fine resolution scheme is proposed to improve the stability of the algorithm and afford a predictable constant latency of 80 ms. The technique was evaluated on 12 free-breathing volunteers and provided an improved real-time description of motion related to both breathing and cardiac cycles. A reduced learning step of 10 s was sufficient without any need for patient-specific control parameters, rendering the method suitable for clinical use.","authors":["Baudouin Denis de Senneville","Abdallah el hamidi","Chrit Moonen"],"meta":["November 2014IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 34(4)","DOI:10.1109/TMI.2014.2371995","SourcePubMed"],"references":["281158911_Continuite_et_differentialite_d'elements_propres_application_a_l'optimisation_de_structures","265625507_Continuite_et_differentiabilite_d'elements_propres_application_a_l'optimisation_de_structures_Continuity_and_differentiability_of_eigen-elements_Application_to_the_optimization_of_structures","222450615_Determining_Optical_Flow","299499924_On_eigenelements_sensitivity_for_compact_self-adjoint_operators_and_applications","281158242_Automatic_Non-Rigid_Calibration_of_Image_Registration_for_Real_Time_Interventional_MRI_of_mobile_organs","272252887_TH-A-BRF-07_Retrospective_Reconstruction_of_3D_Radial_MRI_Data_to_Evaluate_the_Effect_of_Abdominal_Compression_On_4D_Abdominal_Organ_Motion","261325541_Three-dimensional_liver_motion_tracking_using_real-time_two-dimensional_MRI","243095442_The_Rotation_of_Eigenvectors_by_a_Perturbation_III","235730416_MR_Thermometry_in_the_Human_Prostate_Gland_at_30T_for_Transurethral_Ultrasound_Therapy","221678287_An_Algorithm_for_Least_Square_Estimation_of_Non-Linear_Parameters"]}
