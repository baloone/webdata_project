{"id":"229881344_An_empirical_investigation_of_students'_behavioural_intentions_to_use_the_online_learning_course_websites","abstract":"With the development of the Internet in the era of knowledge-driven economy, e-learning is experiencing rapid growth. The online learning course websites are drawing more attention as well. This research combines the innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model, and adds two research variables, perceived system quality and computer self-efficacy to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model to study students' behavioural intentions to use the online learning course websites. This research finds that compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived system quality and computer self-efficacy were critical factors for students' behavioural intentions to use the online learning course websites. By explaining students' behavioural intentions from a user's perspective, the findings of this research help to develop more user-friendly websites and also provide insight into the best way to promote new e-learning tools for students.","authors":["Su-Chao Chang","Feng-Cheng Tung"],"meta":["June 2007British Journal of Educational Technology 39(1):71 - 83","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00742.x"],"references":["233250439_Effects_of_Estimation_Methods_Number_of_Indicators_Per_Factor_and_Improper_Solutions_on_Structural_Equation_Modeling_Fit_Indices","227447282_A_Theoretical_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_Four_Longitudinal_Field_Studies","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","220260272_A_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_of_the_End-User_Computer_Satisfaction_Index","220260113_Information_Technology_Adoption_Across_Time_A_Cross-Sectional_Comparison_of_Pre-Adoption_and_Post-Adoption_Beliefs","289963269_Re-Examining_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_Usefulness_A_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis","257496313_Successful_Implementation_of_e-Learning_Pedagogical_Considerations","247410202_Power_Analysis_and_Determination_of_Sample_Size_for_Covariance_Structure_Modeling","242544141_EQS_Structural_Equation_Program_manual","241800748_On_the_Use_Usefulness_and_Ease_of_Use_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling_in_MIS_Research_A_Note_of_Caution","237202324_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_With_Unobservable_Variable_Sand_Measurement_Error","227837535_Using_Davis's_Perceived_Usefulness_and_Ease-of-use_Instruments_for_Decision_Making_A_Confirmatory_and_Multigroup_Invariance_Analysis","227763177_A_Model_of_the_Antecedents_of_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_Development_and_Test","225359099_On_the_Evaluation_of_Structure_Equation_Models","223563981_Predicting_consumer_intentions_to_use_on-line_shopping_The_case_for_an_augmented_technology_acceptance_model","222953211_Usability_quality_value_and_e-learning_continuance_decisions","222640155_Web-based_teaching_and_learner_control_A_research_review","222581758_Integrating_internet_tools_into_traditional_CS_distance_education_Students'_attitudes","222522861_What_Drives_Mobile_Commerce_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_the_Revised_Technology_Acceptance_Model","222246623_Using_the_World_Wide_Web_for_teaching_improvement","220591519_What_Makes_an_ERP_Implementation_Relationship_Worthwhile_Linking_Trust_Mechanisms_and_ERP_Usefulness","220259891_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Development_of_a_Measure_and_Initial_Test","220079750_Assessing_the_Validity_of_IS_Success_Models_An_Empirical_Test_and_Theoretical_Analysis","220079739_Todd_P_Understanding_Information_Technology_Usage_A_Test_of_Competing_Models_Information_Systems_Research_62_144-176","220079676_A_Respecification_and_Extension_of_the_DeLone_and_McLean_Model_of_IS_Success","220079599_Development_of_an_Instrument_Ot_Mesure_the_Perceptions_of_Adopting_an_Information_Technology_Innovation","220079553_A_Conceptual_and_Operational_Definition_of_Personal_Innovativeness_in_the_Domain_of_Information_Technology","220041686_Diffusion_Of_Innovation","200824454_Power_Analysis_and_Determination_of_Sample_Size_for_Covariance_Structure_Modeling_Article"]}
