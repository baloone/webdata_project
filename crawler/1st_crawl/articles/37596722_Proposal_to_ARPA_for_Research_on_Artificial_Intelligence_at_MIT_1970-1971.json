{"id":"37596722_Proposal_to_ARPA_for_Research_on_Artificial_Intelligence_at_MIT_1970-1971","abstract":"The MIT Artificial Intelligence Project has a variety of goals all bound together by search for principles of intelligent behavior. Among our immediate goals are to develop systems with practical applications for: Visually-controlled automatic manipulation and physical world problem-solving, machine understanding of natural language text and narrative, and advanced applied mathematics. The long-range goals are concerned with simplifying, unifying and extending the techniques of heuristic programming. We expect the results of our work to: make it easier to write and debug large heuristic programs, develop packaged collections of knowledge about many different kinds of things, lending to programs with more resourcefulness, understanding and common sense\", and identify and sharpen certain principles for programming intelligence.","authors":["Marvin Minsky","Seymour Papert"],"meta":["October 2004"],"references":[]}
