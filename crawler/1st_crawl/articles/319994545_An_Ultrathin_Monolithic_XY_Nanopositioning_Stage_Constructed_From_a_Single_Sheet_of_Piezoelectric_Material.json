{"id":"319994545_An_Ultrathin_Monolithic_XY_Nanopositioning_Stage_Constructed_From_a_Single_Sheet_of_Piezoelectric_Material","abstract":"The article describes an XY nanopositioning stage constructed from flexures and actuators machined into a single sheet of piezoelectric material. Ultrasonic machining is used to remove piezoelectric material and create electrode features. The constructed device is 0.508mm thick and has a travel range of 8.6Î¼m in the X and Y axes. The first resonance mode occurs at 597Hz which makes the device suitable for a wide range of standard nanopositioning applications where cost and size are considerations. Experimental atomic force microscopy is performed using the proposed device as a sample scanner.","authors":["Andrew John Fleming","Yuen Kuan Yong"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2017.2755659","Project: Monolithic Piezo Nanopositioning"],"references":["310493334_Preloading_Piezoelectric_Stack_Actuators_in_High-Speed_Nanopositioning_Systems","264427589_Damping_Controller_Design_for_Nanopositioners_A_Mixed_Passivity_Negative-Imaginary_and_Small-Gain_Approach","262388793_Performance_of_sinusoidal_scanning_with_MPC_in_AFM_imaging","234029599_Invited_Review_Article_High-speed_flexure-guided_nanopositioning_Mechanical_design_and_control_issues","231007462_Frequency_locking_of_an_optical_cavity_using_linear_-_Quadratic_Gaussian_integral_control","224717933_A_Tutorial_on_the_Mechanisms_Dynamics_and_Control_of_Atomic_Force_Microscopes","51520744_A_transparent_polymeric_flexure-hinge_nanopositioner_actuated_by_a_piezoelectric_stack_actuator","5613280_Piezo-assisted_In_Vitro_Fertilization_of_Mouse_Oocytes_with_Spermatozoa_Retrieved_from_Epididymides_Stored_at_4_Degree_C","3332938_A_Survey_of_Control_Issues_in_Nanopositioning","3207883_Precision_Positioning_of_Wafer_Scanners_Segmented_Iterative_Learning_Control_for_Nonrepetitive_Disturbances_Applications_of_Control","329162007_Compliant_Mechanisms_Design_of_Flexure_Hinges","320474424_Theory_of_Vibration_with_Applications","316800514_Design_Modeling_and_Control_of_Nanopositioning_Systems","311633269_A_comparison_of_scanning_methods_and_the_vertical_control_implications_for_scanning_probe_microscopy_Comparison_of_Scanning_Methods_Vertical_Control_Implications_for_SPM","308827989_Design_modeling_and_characterization_of_an_XY_nanopositioning_stage_constructed_from_a_single_sheet_of_piezoelectric_material","303779048_Combining_Spiral_Scanning_and_Internal_Model_Control_for_Sequential_AFM_Imaging_at_Video_Rate","295833358_A_Closed-Loop_Controlled_Nanomanipulation_System_for_Probing_Nanostructures_Inside_Scanning_Electron_Microscopes","276853450_A_New_Flexure-Based_Ytheta_Nanomanipulator_With_Nanometer-Scale_Resolution_and_Millimeter-Scale_Workspace","259137301_Measuring_and_predicting_resolution_in_nanopositioning_systems","238523079_Q_Control_of_an_Atomic_Force_Microscope_Microcantilever_A_Sensorless_Approach","238208860_Corner-Filleted_Flexure_Hinges","224626950_PPF_Control_of_a_Piezoelectric_Tube_Scanner","224474583_Single-Tube_Three-Dimensional_Scanner_for_Scanning_Tunneling_Microscopy","224162212_Design_characterization_and_control_of_a_monolithic_three-axis_high-bandwidth_nanopositioning_stage","221729189_Compact_ultra-fast_vertical_nanopositioner_for_improving_scanning_probe_microscope_scan_speed","44601552_Bridging_the_gap_Between_Conventional_and_Video-Speed_Scanning_Probe_Microscopes","5604289_Simulation_of_dynamics-coupling_in_piezoelectric_tube_scanners_by_reduced_order_finite_element_analysis","3344780_Virtual_reality_and_haptics_for_nanorobotics_-_A_review_study","3207969_Scanning_Probe_Microscopy"]}
