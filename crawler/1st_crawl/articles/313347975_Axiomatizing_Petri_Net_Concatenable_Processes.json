{"id":"313347975_Axiomatizing_Petri_Net_Concatenable_Processes","abstract":"The concatenable processes of a Petri net $N$ can be characterized abstractly as the arrows of a symmetric monoidal category $P[N]$. Yet, this is only a partial axiomatization, since $P[N]$ is built on a concrete, ad hoc chosen, category of symmetries. In this paper we give a fully equational description of the category of concatenable processes of $N$, thus yielding an axiomatic theory of the noninterleaving behaviour of Petri nets.","authors":["V.
