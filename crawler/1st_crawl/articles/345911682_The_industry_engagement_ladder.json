This paper seeks to provide structured guidance in the form of what is titled the Industry Engagement Ladder.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe Industry Engagement Ladder presents a selection of collaboration opportunities, outlining the possible cooperation mechanisms between an industry partner and the academic institution.\n\nFindings\nOpportunities are described and ranked according to the amount of investment required by the industrial partner, and therefore risk, from low to high.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis concise paper provides a quick reference for perspective industry academia collaboration opportunities, the risks involved with each, the possible funding available to help foster these partnerships and the benefits to industry. These collaborative activities (and variations thereof) can be incorporated by any university department. The manuscript offers an ideal starting point for industryâ€“university collaboration.","authors":["Dylan Rees","Qiru Wang","Robert S.
