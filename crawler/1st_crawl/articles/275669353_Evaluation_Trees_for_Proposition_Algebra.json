{"id":"275669353_Evaluation_Trees_for_Proposition_Algebra","abstract":"Proposition algebra is based on Hoare's conditional connective, which is a\nternary connective comparable to if-then-else and used in the setting of\npropositional logic. Conditional statements are provided with a simple\nsemantics that is based on evaluation trees and that characterizes so-called\nfree valuation congruence: two conditional statements are free valuation\ncongruent if, and only if, they have equal evaluation trees. Free valuation\ncongruence is axiomatized by the four basic equational axioms of proposition\nalgebra that define the conditional connective. Valuation congruences that\nidentify more conditional statements than free valuation congruence are\nrepetition-proof, contractive, memorizing, and static valuation congruence.\nEach of these valuation congruences is characterized using a transformation on\nevaluation trees: two conditional statements are C-valuation congruent if, and\nonly if, their C-transformed evaluation trees are equal. These transformations\nare simple and natural, and only for static valuation congruence a slightly\nmore complex transformation is used. Also, each of these valuation congruences\nis axiomatized in proposition algebra. A spin-off of our approach is \"basic\nform semantics for proposition algebra\": for each valuation congruence C\nconsidered, two conditional statements are C-valuation congruent if, and only\nif, they have equal C-basic forms, where C-basic forms are obtained by a\nsyntactic transformation of conditional statements, which is a form of\nnormalization.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Alban Ponse"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23506-6_6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["277076293_Evaluation_Trees_for_Proposition_Algebra_version_2","234807246_Laws_of_Programming","279957000_Dynamic_Logic","268840656_A_couple_of_novelties_in_the_propositional_calculus","262396232_Communicating_Sequential_Process","260584255_Really_Rethinking_'Formal_Methods'","245982066_Dynamic_Logic_in_Handbook_of_Philosophical_Logic_II","245805381_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","242504479_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","234831530_Essays_in_computing_science","230791944_Proposition_Algebra_and_Short-Circuit_Logic","229580430_A_Couple_of_Novelties_in_the_Propositional_Calculus","225291114_Completeness_for_Two_Left-Sequential_Logics","223397090_Program_algebra_for_sequential_code","220695904_Communicating_Sequential_Processes"]}
