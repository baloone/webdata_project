{"id":"262972073_Non-uniformity_Correction_of_Infrared_Images_by_Midway_Equalization","abstract":"The non-uniformity is a time-dependent noise caused by the lack of sensor equalization.\n\nWe present here the detailed algorithm and on line demo of the non-uniformity correction method by midway infrared equalization. This method was designed to suit infrared images. Nevertheless, it can be applied to images produced for example by scanners, or by push-broom satellites.\n\nThe obtained single image method works on static images, is fully automatic, having no user parameter, and requires no registration. It needs no camera motion compensation, no closed aperture sensor equalization and is able to correct for a fully non-linear non-uniformity.","authors":["Yohann Tendero","St√©phane Landeau","Jerome Gilles"],"meta":["July 2012Image Processing On Line 2:134--146","DOI:10.5201/ipol.2012.glmt-mire"],"references":["276034152_Simplest_Color_Balance","228575631_Efficient_single_image_non-uniformity_correction_algorithm","220843558_An_Enhancement_to_the_Constant_Range_Method_for_Nonuniformity_Correction_of_Infrared_Image_Sequences","23294930_Correction_of_systematic_spatial_noise_in_push-broom_hyperspectral_sensors_Application_to_CHRISPROBA_images","10861387_Kalman_filtering_for_adaptive_nonuniformity_correction_in_infrared_focal-plane_arrays","271482908_A_relative_radiometric_correction_method_for_linear_array_push-broom_imagery","269072580_Infrared_nonuniformity_correction_and_radiometric_calibration_technology_using_U-shaped_blackbody","246974019_Nonuniformity_correction_for_staring_IR_focal_plane_arrays_using_scene-based_techniques","40653305_Stabilization_of_Flicker-Like_Effects_in_Image_Sequences_through_Local_Contrast_Correction","5514319_Scene-Based_Nonuniformity_Correction_with_Video_Sequences_and_Registration","3326994_Nonuniformity_Correction_of_Infrared_Image_Sequences_Using_the_Constant-Statistics_Constraint","2290427_Minimizing_the_Ghosting_Artifact_in_Scene-Based_Nonuniformity_Correction"]}
