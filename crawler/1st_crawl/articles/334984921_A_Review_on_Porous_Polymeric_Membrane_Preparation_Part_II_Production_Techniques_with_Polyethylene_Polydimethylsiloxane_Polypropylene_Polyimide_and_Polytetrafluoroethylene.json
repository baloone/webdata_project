{"id":"334984921_A_Review_on_Porous_Polymeric_Membrane_Preparation_Part_II_Production_Techniques_with_Polyethylene_Polydimethylsiloxane_Polypropylene_Polyimide_and_Polytetrafluoroethylene","abstract":"The development of porous polymeric membranes is an important area of application in separation technology. This article summarizes the development of porous polymers from the perspectives of materials and methods for membrane production. Polymers such as polyethylene, polydimethylsiloxane, polypropylene, polyimide, and polytetrafluoroethylene are reviewed due to their outstanding thermal stability, chemical resistance, mechanical strength, and low cost. Six different methods for membrane fabrication are critically reviewed, including thermally induced phase separation, melt-spinning and cold-stretching, phase separation micromolding, imprinting/soft molding, manual punching, and three-dimensional printing. Each method is described in details related to the strategy used to produce the porous polymeric membranes with a specific morphology and separation performances. The key factors associated with each method are presented, including solvent/non-solvent system type and composition, polymer solution composition and concentration, processing parameters, and ambient conditions. Current challenges are also described, leading to future development and innovation to improve these membranes in terms of materials, fabrication equipment, and possible modifications.","authors":["Tan","Rodrigue"],"meta":["August 2019Polymers 11(8):1310","DOI:10.3390/polym11081310"],"references":["334311171_A_Review_on_Porous_Polymeric_Membrane_Preparation_Part_I_Production_Techniques_with_Polysulfone_and_Poly_Vinylidene_Fluoride","324991541_Investigation_of_the_Use_of_a_Bio-Derived_Solvent_for_Non-Solvent-Induced_Phase_Separation_NIPS_Fabrication_of_Polysulfone_Membranes","323856416_Large-scale_fabrication_of_free-standing_and_sub-mm_PDMS_through-hole_membranes","322848705_A_review_of_polymeric_membranes_and_processes_for_potable_water_reuse","332736660_Effects_of_Cooling_Ways_on_the_Structure_of_Polypropylene_Hollow_Fiber_Membranes_Prepared_by_Stretching","328585622_The_effect_of_nanoperlite_and_its_silane_treatment_on_thermal_properties_and_degradation_of_polypropylenenanoperlite_nanocomposite_films","321823202_Progress_and_perspectives_in_PTFE_membrane_Preparation_modification_and_applications","320502256_Flat_sheet_membrane_elaboration_by_TIPS_method_using_palm_oil_as_solvent_and_its_application_in_membrane_distillation","319022270_Through-membrane_electron-beam_lithography_for_ultrathin_membrane_applications","318505339_Cold_sintering_Current_status_and_prospects"]}
