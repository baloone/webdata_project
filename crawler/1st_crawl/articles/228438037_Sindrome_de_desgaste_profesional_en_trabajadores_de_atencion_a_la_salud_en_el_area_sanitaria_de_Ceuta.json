{"id":"228438037_Sindrome_de_desgaste_profesional_en_trabajadores_de_atencion_a_la_salud_en_el_area_sanitaria_de_Ceuta","abstract":"Objective: \nThe aim of this study is to determine the levels of burnout among employees of health care workers in the Health Area of Ceuta (Spain).\n\nDesign: \nPrevalence study.\n\nSetting: \nCeuta Health Area (Primary and Specialty Care).\n\nParticipants: \nA sample of 200 workers stratified by sex, job and workplace.\n\nMeasurements: \nThe tool used was the MBI (Maslach Burnout Inventory). We also studied personal (age, sex, marital status) and work variables (centre, job, age) and blood parameters (C-reactive protein and others).\n\nResults: \nThe burnout syndrome was present in 17.2% of workers (95% CI: 10.4-26.0). There was a significant relationship with job, with differences in emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and professional achievement. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in workers with burnout.\n\nConclusions: \nBurnout prevalence in the health care workers in our sample is similar to other studies. The differences between health and non-health workers could be due to greater motivation for professional achievement, but they scored higher in exhaustion and depersonalisation. The increase in C-reactive protein, a non-specific inflammation marker, seems to confirm the findings of other studies.","authors":["Julián Manuel","Domínguez Fernández","Francisco Herrera Clavero","María Del"],"meta":["January 2012Atención Primaria 44(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.aprim.2011.01.004"],"references":["281709644_Testing_for_the_Factorial_Validity_of_the_MBI_Results_for_a_multiocupational_sample","267217914_Sindrome_de_burnout_en_enfermeras_de_un_centro_medico","263276194_El_sindrome_de_quemarse_por_el_trabajo_burnout_grupos_profesionales_de_riesgo","262751638_The_influence_of_gender_on_the_development_of_Burnout_syndrome_process_in_nursing_professionals","227634716_The_Measurement_of_Experienced_Burnout","28113160_Validez_factorial_del_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory_en_una_muestra_multiocupacional","11073598_Hospital_nurse_staffing_and_patient_mortality_nurse_burnout_and_job_dissatisfaction","285914374_Desgaste_Profesional_y_clima_laboral_en_Atencion_Primaria","277172544_El_sindrome_de_Burnout_variables_laborales_personales_y_psicopatologicas_asociadas","272321559_Hospital_Nurse_Staffing_and_Patient_Mortality_Nurse_Burnout_and_Job_Dissatisfaction","260991875_Estres_trabajo_y_salud_Caracteristicas_laborales_contexto_ocupacional_y_diferencias_individuales","237697675_Sindrome_del_Quemado_en_el_personal_de_enfermeria_psiquiatrica_de_hospitales_griegos","232425432_Career_Burnout_Causes_and_Cures","227583152_Staff_Burn-Out","49503934_La_insoportable_levedad_del_ser","26379239_Aspectos_epidemiologicos_del_sindrome_de_Burnout_en_personal_sanitario","7517313_The_Association_Between_Burnout_Depression_Anxiety_and_Inflammation_Biomarkers_C-Reactive_Protein_and_Fibrinogen_in_Men_and_Women"]}
