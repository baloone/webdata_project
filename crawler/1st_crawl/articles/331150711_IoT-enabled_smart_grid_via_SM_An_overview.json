{"id":"331150711_IoT-enabled_smart_grid_via_SM_An_overview","abstract":"Power quality and reliability issues are big challenges to both service provider and consumers in conventional power grids. The ongoing technological advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) era provide better solutions to enhance the management of these challenges and enforce the measures of a Smart Grid (SG). Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Smart Metering (SM) technologies are enabler technologies that can modernize the conventional power grid through exposing the hidden details of electrical power by introducing two-way communication scheme during power transaction process between utilities and consumers. Throughout literature, AMI and SM technologies are widely discussed. However, few studies discuss the role of SM in power quality and reliability monitoring in IoT-enabled SGs. Hence, the paper aims to comprehensively review the feasibility of employing SM for power quality and reliability monitoring. First, we provide a detailed overview about the SMs, wireless communication technologies, and routing algorithms as enabling technologies in AMI. Then, we categorize the existing literature works that target power quality and reliability monitoring. Finally, open research issues are outlined based on shortages in the existing literature.","authors":["Fadi Al-Turjman","Mohammad Abujubbeh"],"meta":["February 2019Future Generation Computer Systems 96(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2019.02.012","Project: IoT Enabled Smart Cities and Smart Grid"],"references":["326961186_Confidential_smart-sensing_framework_in_the_IoT_era","321986256_The_impact_of_the_installation_of_smart_meters_on_distribution_system_reliability","320748516_Modelling_Green_Femtocells_in_Smart-grids","318894667_Advances_on_Sensing_Technologies_for_Smart_Cities_and_Power_Grids_A_Review","318866065_LoRaWAN_-_A_Low_Power_WAN_Protocol_for_Internet_of_Things_a_Review_and_Opportunities","316572597_Big_Data_management_in_smart_grid_concepts_requirements_and_implementation","316530874_Smart_metering_in_smart_grid_framework_A_review","315505158_A_survey_on_LPWA_technology_LoRa_and_NB-IoT","312561546_A_routing_optimization_method_based_on_risk_prediction_for_communication_services_in_smart_grid","310825072_Syncretic_Use_of_Smart_Meters_for_Power_Quality_Monitoring_in_Emerging_Networks","304003750_From_Smart_Metering_to_Smart_Grid","301876968_System_Design_of_Internet-of-Things_for_Residential_Smart_Grid","345839216_The_adequacy_of_LoRaWAN_on_smart_grids_A_comparison_with_RF_mesh_technology","329941008_LaGOON_A_Simple_Energy-aware_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Nano_Sensor_Networks","327935703_The_road_towards_plant_phenotyping_via_WSNs_An_overview","327294535_Smart-grid_and_solar_energy_harvesting_in_the_IoT_era_An_overview","326962622_Small_Cells_in_the_Forthcoming_5GIoT_Traffic_Modelling_and_Deployment_Overview","324237178_Low_Complexity_Parity_Check_Code_for_Futuristic_Wireless_Networks_Applications","323791821_Machine_learning_Techniques_for_Energy_Theft_Detection_in_AMI","323311811_QoS-aware_Data_Delivery_Framework_for_Safety-inspired_Multimedia_in_Integrated_Vehicular-IoT","323296395_Context-Sensitive_Access_in_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_IIoT_Healthcare_Applications","321762446_5G-enabled_devices_and_smart-spaces_in_social-IoT_An_overview","321202727_Next_generation_smart_metering_IP_metering","320664517_Smart_electricity_meter_data_analytics_A_brief_review","320201952_Mobile_Couriers'_Selection_for_the_Smart-grid_in_Smart-cities'_Pervasive_Sensing","319092180_Communication_theories_and_protocols_for_smart_grid_hierarchical_network","318736451_Energy_efficient_and_QoS-aware_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network-based_Smart_Grid_Applications_in_the_Context_of_Industry_40","317621899_A_survey_on_consumers_empowerment_communication_technologies_and_renewable_generation_penetration_within_Smart_Grid","317417967_Review_on_AMI_technology_for_Smart_Meter","317393568_A_Graph_Theory_Based_Energy_Routing_Algorithm_in_Energy_Local_Area_Network_e-LAN","315663253_A_Review_Of_Power_Quality_Standards_Electrical_Software_Tools_Issues_and_Solutions","315530537_Modelling_Green_HetNets_in_Dynamic_Ultra_Large-Scale_Applications_A_Case-study_for_Femtocells_in_Smart-cities","315468285_Communication_Reliability","314955186_Improving_the_reliability_of_HWMP_for_smart_grid_neighborhood_area_networks","313886555_Smart_Sensor_Network_for_Power_Quality_Monitoring_in_Electrical_Installations","313543604_Development_and_field_experiment_of_wide_area_Wi-SUN_system_based_on_IEEE_802154g","309613378_A_survey_on_smart_grid","308781209_End-to-End_Delay_Analysis_of_Wireless_Mesh_Backbone_Network_in_a_Smart_Grid","307435874_Emerging_smart_metering_trends_and_integration_at_MV-LV_level","305782859_Smart_grid_communication_technologies-_overview_research_challenges_and_opportunities","305685955_Advanced_metering_infrastructure_Technology_and_challenges","305676351_Calculating_power_distribution_system_reliability_indexes_from_Smart_Meter_data","305293150_Review_of_Signal_Processing_Techniques_for_Detection_of_Power_Quality_Events","304294130_Smart_metering_and_functionalities_of_smart_meters_in_smart_grid_-_a_review","304027350_A_reliable_opportunistic_routing_for_smart_grid_with_in-home_power_line_communication_networks","301838481_Smart_Grid_Testbed_for_Demand_Focused_Energy_Management_in_End_User_Environments","301443315_A_routing_algorithm_to_long_lifetime_network_for_the_intelligent_power_distribution_network_in_smart_grid","289962391_A_neurofuzzy_QoS_-Aware_routing_protocol_for_smart_grids","288056962_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Smart_Energy_Meters_in_Intelligent_Energy_Networks","286480289_Outage_Management_of_Distribution_Systems_Incorporating_Information_From_Smart_Meters","276036328_Recursive_Pyramid_Algorithm-Based_Discrete_Wavelet_Transform_for_Reactive_Power_Measurement_in_Smart_Meters","286244153_QoS_Routing_Algorithm_of_WSN_for_Smart_Distribution_Grid","284712210_Demand_Response_Management_for_Residential_Smart_Grid_From_Theory_to_Practice","283709650_Power_quality_techniques_research_worldwide_A_review","283030752_Feature_Extraction_and_Power_Quality_Disturbances_Classification_Using_Smart_Meters"]}
