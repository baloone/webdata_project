{"id":"326164263_Analysis_of_impedance_data_from_bubble_flow_in_a_glassSU8_microfluidic_device_with_on-channel_sensors","abstract":"This paper presents the design and original fabrication of a fully transparent microfluidic reactor with integrated electrical sensors over the microchannel. The transparent chip design allows for microscale photochemistry, and permits direct, real-time visual and electrical observation. The microchip uses optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes as sensing elements for in-channel phase tracking. High-speed videography was used to validate the electrical measurement data. The device permits visual observation of microchannel bubble flow while simultaneously acquiring electrical data. The aim of this work is to develop and optically verify electrical data acquisition and signal analysis methodologies, which in future applications may be used for inexpensive non-destructive monitoring of two-phase microchannel flows, in systems where detailed visual observation may be infeasible.","authors":["Mohammadmahdi Talebi","Peter Woias","Keith Cobry"],"meta":["July 2018Sensors and Actuators A Physical 279","DOI:10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.004"],"references":["327033781_Microfluidics_and_nanofluidics_handbook_Fabrication_implementation_and_applications"]}
