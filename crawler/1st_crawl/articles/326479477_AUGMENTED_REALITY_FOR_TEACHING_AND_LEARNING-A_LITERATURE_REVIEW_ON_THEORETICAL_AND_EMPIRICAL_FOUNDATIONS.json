{"id":"326479477_AUGMENTED_REALITY_FOR_TEACHING_AND_LEARNING-A_LITERATURE_REVIEW_ON_THEORETICAL_AND_EMPIRICAL_FOUNDATIONS","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) based teaching and learning has evolved rapidly over the past years. Researchers have shown that AR has the potential to deliver persuasive learning experiences in formal teaching (e.g., in classrooms) and in informal learning environments (e.g., museums). However, comparatively little extant research is firmly grounded in learning theories and applies rigorous empirical methods to evaluate the effect of AR on learning performance. In order to build a cumulative body of knowledge on AR-based instructional design and its effectiveness, it is necessary to consolidate both the theoretical foundations of and empirical evidence for using AR for teaching and learning. Against this background we conducted a focused systematic literature review on theoretical and empirical foundations of AR in education. We identify theory-based design elements and empirical measures for developing and applying AR teaching and learning applications and consolidate them in a design framework.","authors":["Peter Sommerauer","Oliver MÃ¼ller"],"meta":["June 2018","Conference: European Conference on Information Systems 2018At: Portsmouth, UK","Project: Principles for effective Learning Analytics in Augmented Reality learning applications for professional education"],"references":["321278772_Revisiting_the_Factor_Structure_of_the_System_Usability_Scale","320200722_A_brief_review_of_augmented_reality_science_learning","319054612_Application_of_Augmented_Reality_for_Early_Childhood_English_Teaching","318418603_Design_Computer-Assisted_Learning_in_an_Online_Augmented_Reality_Environment_Based_on_Shneiderman's_Eight_Golden_Rules","352794453_Simulation_of_Investigating_the_Earth_and_Universe_Using_Interactive_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Based_On_Smart_Evaluation","319394294_Mindstorms","318373723_A_systematic_review_of_augmented_reality_applications_in_maintenance","316004913_Where_Does_My_Augmented_Reality_Learning_Experience_ARLE_Belong_A_Student_and_Teacher_Perspective_to_Positioning_ARLEs","314948760_Apply_an_Augmented_Reality_in_a_Mobile_Guidance_to_Increase_Sense_of_Place_for_Heritage_Places","308194597_A_review_of_using_Augmented_Reality_in_Education_from_2011_to_2016"]}
