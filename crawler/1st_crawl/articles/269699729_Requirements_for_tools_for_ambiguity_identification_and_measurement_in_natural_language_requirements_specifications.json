{"id":"269699729_Requirements_for_tools_for_ambiguity_identification_and_measurement_in_natural_language_requirements_specifications","abstract":"This paper proposes a two-step approach to identifying ambiguities in natural language (NL) requirements specifications (RSs). In the first step, a tool would apply a set of ambiguity measures to a RS in order to identify potentially ambiguous sentences in the RS. In the second step, another tool would show what specifically is potentially ambiguous about each potentially ambiguous sentence. The final decision of ambiguity remains with the human users of the tools. The paper describes two requirements-identification case studies with one small NL RS using a prototype of the first tool based on an existing NL processing system and a manual simulation of the second tool.","authors":["Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya","Nicola Zeni","Luisa Mich","Daniel M Berry"],"meta":["September 2008Requirements Engineering 13(3):207-239","DOI:10.1007/s00766-008-0063-7","Project: Semantic annotation for requirements engineering"],"references":["316792512_Fallacies_Arising_from_Ambiguity","284652014_Word_sense_disambiguation_The_state_of_the_art","260537281_Ambiguity_Measures_in_Requirements_Engineering","325495857_Pragmatics","284543783_Software_Engineering_Economics","268243708_Fallacies_Arising_from_Ambiguity","265756293_Avoiding_Ambiguity_in_Requirements_Specifications","249729289_Improving_the_Quality_of_Requirements_Specifications_via_Automatically_Created_Object-Oriented_Models","246372989_High_Quality_Requirements_Specifications_for_Embedded_Systems_through_Authoring_Rules_and_Language_P","246147095_Exploring_Requirements_Quality_Before_Design_Dorset_House"]}
