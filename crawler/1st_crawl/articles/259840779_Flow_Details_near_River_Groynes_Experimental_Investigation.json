{"id":"259840779_Flow_Details_near_River_Groynes_Experimental_Investigation","abstract":"Experiments have been carried out in a fixed-bed flume for a schematised straight river reach with groynes on one side to study the dynamics of the flow near groynes. The flume had a geometrical scale of 1âˆ¶40, based on typical dimensions of the Dutch River Waal. Both emergent and submerged groynes were studied. The measurements demonstrate the differences in the nature of the turbulence between submerged and emerged groynes stages; and provide insight into the flow pattern in the vicinity of groynes, the shape and the extent of the mixing layer at different flow stages, and the dynamic behaviour of the velocity along the mixing layer between the main channel and the groyne fields. A parametrisation of the turbulence characteristics of the flow near groynes is presented. Large-scale velocity fluctuations are found in all test cases, with time-scales that vary with the flow stage. The large-scale u and v velocity fluctuations are in phase in the centre of the mixing layer and out of phase for the points on the boundaries of the mixing layer.","authors":["Mohamed Yossef","Huib de Vriend"],"meta":["January 2010Journal of Hydraulic Engineering 137(5):504-516","DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000326"],"references":["259840683_Reproduction_of_groynes-induced_river_bed_morphology_using_LES_in_a_2-D_morphological_model","245297897_Sediment_Exchange_between_a_River_and_Its_Groyne_Fields_Mobile-Bed_Experiment","301346166_Turbulence_characteristics_of_a_shear_flow_in_an_embayment_attached_to_a_straight_open_channel","279575713_THE_DESIGN_OF_SPURS_FOR_RIVER_TRAINING","270435408_3D_Numerical_Simulation_of_Turbulent_Shallow-Water_Flow_in_Square_Harbor","252927325_Effects_of_shallowness_on_the_development_of_free-surface_mixing_layers","245476634_Large_Eddy_Simulations_of_Three-Dimensional_Flows_Around_a_Spur_Dike","245297240_Momentum_Exchange_in_Straight_Uniform_Compound_Channel_Flow","245297095_Effects_of_Groyne_Layout_on_the_Flow_in_Groyne_Fields_Laboratory_Experiments","245296829_Exchange_Processes_between_a_River_and_Its_Groyne_Fields_Model_Experiments"]}
