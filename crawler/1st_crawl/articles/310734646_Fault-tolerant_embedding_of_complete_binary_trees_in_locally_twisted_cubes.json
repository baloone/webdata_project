{"id":"310734646_Fault-tolerant_embedding_of_complete_binary_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","abstract":"The complete binary tree is an important network structure for parallel and distributed computing, which has many nice properties and is often used to be embedded into other interconnection architectures. The locally twisted cube is an important variant of the hypercube . It has many better properties than with the same number of edges and vertices. The main results obtained in this paper are: (1) The complete binary tree rooted at an arbitrary vertex of can be embedded with dilation 2 and congestion 1 into . (2) When there exists only one faulty node in , both the dilation and congestion will become 2 after reconfiguring . (3) When there exist two faulty nodes in , then both the dilation and congestion will become 3 after reconfiguring . (4) For any faulty set of with , both the dilation and congestion will become 3 after reconfiguring under certain constraints.","authors":["Zhao Liu","Jianxi Fan","Jingya Zhou","Baolei Cheng"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing 101","DOI:10.1016/j.jpdc.2016.11.005"],"references":["220089257_Edge-fault-tolerant_hamiltonicity_of_locally_twisted_cubes_under_conditional_edge_faults","3299614_The_crossed_cube_architecture_for_parallel_computing","3044723_Fault_Hamiltonicity_and_Fault_Hamiltonian_Connectivity_of_the_Arrangement_Graphs","3042780_Embedding_Complete_Binary_Trees_into_Butterfly_Networks","2665849_Embedding_graphs_onto_the_Supercube","313556125_The_twisted_cube","310752782_The_twisted_cube","300408699_Dynamic_Reconfiguration_of_Complete_Binary_Trees_in_Faulty_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","287148222_23-Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","285386104_Fault-tolerant_vertex-pancyclicity_of_locally_twisted_cubes_LTQn","284012758_Complete_binary_trees_embeddings_in_Mobius_cubes","271659612_Embedding_complete_binary_trees_into_parity_cubes","265129469_A_systematic_approach_for_embedding_of_Hamiltonian_cycles_through_a_prescribed_edge_in_locally_twisted_cubes","260440389_Wavelength_assignment_for_locally_twisted_cube_communication_pattern_on_optical_bus_network-on-chip","257252425_Dimension-adjacent_trees_and_parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_on_crossed_cubes","257145347_Fault-tolerant_path_embedding_in_folded_hypercubes_with_both_node_and_edge_faults","237131030_On_cubes_and_dichotomic_trees","234801224_Load-balance_and_fault-tolerance_for_embedding_a_complete_binary_tree_in_an_IEH_with_AT-expansion","223483307_Embedding_Hamiltonian_Cycles_into_Folded_Hypercubes_with_Faulty_Links","222521162_Optimal_Dynamic_Embeddings_of_Complete_Binary_Trees_into_Hypercubes","222509103_Highly_fault-tolerant_cycle_embeddings_of_hypercubes","222300202_Optimal_fault-tolerant_embedding_of_paths_in_twisted_cubes","222156651_Embedding_meshes_into_crossed_cubes","221440518_Optimal_Distortion_Embedding_of_Complete_Binary_Trees_into_Lines","221041023_All-fault-tolerant_embedding_of_a_complete_binary_tree_in_a_group_of_Cayley_graphs","220661251_The_locally_twisted_cubes","220588056_Dynamic_Reconfiguration_of_Complete_Binary_Trees_in_Faulty_Hypercubes","220586101_The_Twisted-Cube_Connected_Networks","220569164_Expansion_of_layouts_of_complete_binary_trees_into_grids","220315018_Embedding_meshes_into_locally_twisted_cubes","220313629_On_the_fault-tolerant_embeddings_of_complete_binary_trees_in_the_mesh_interconnection_networks","220209445_Complete_binary_trees_in_folded_and_enhanced_cubes","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","3044182_Area-Efficient_VLSI_Layouts_for_Binary_Hypercubes","3043516_Embedding_binary_trees_into_crossed_cubes","3043496_The_Mobius_cubes","3042877_A_Variation_on_the_hypercube_with_lower_diameter","2639154_Congestion-Free_Dilation-2_Embedding_of_Complete_Binary_Trees_into_Star_Graphs"]}
