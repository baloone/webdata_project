{"id":"40009690_On_Derivations_in_Near-Rings","abstract":"The literature on near-rings contains a number of theorems asserting that certain conditions implying commutativity in rings imply multiplicative or additive commutativity in special classes of near-rings. We shall add to this body of results several commutativity theorems for near-rings admitting suitably-constrained derivations.","authors":["Howard E.
