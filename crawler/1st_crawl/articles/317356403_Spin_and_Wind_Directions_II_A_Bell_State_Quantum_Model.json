{"id":"317356403_Spin_and_Wind_Directions_II_A_Bell_State_Quantum_Model","abstract":"In the first half of this two-part article, we analyzed a cognitive psychology experiment where participants were asked to select pairs of directions that they considered to be the best example of 'Two Different Wind Directions', and showed that the data violate the CHSH version of Bell's inequality, with same magnitude as in typical Bell-test experiments in physics. In this second part, we complete our analysis by presenting a symmetrized version of the experiment, still violating the CHSH inequality but now also obeying the marginal law, for which we provide a full quantum modeling in Hilbert space, using a singlet state and suitably chosen product measurements. We also address some of the criticisms that have been recently directed at experiments of this kind, according to which they would not highlight the presence of genuine forms of entanglement. We explain that these criticisms are based on a view of entanglement that is too restrictive, thus unable to capture all possible ways physical and conceptual entities can connect and form systems behaving as a whole. We also provide an example of a mechanical model showing that the violations of the marginal law and Bell inequalities are generally to be associated with different mechanisms.","authors":["Diederik Aerts","Jonito Aerts ArguÃ«lles","Lester Beltran","Suzette Geriente"],"meta":["June 2018Foundations of Science 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10699-017-9530-2","Project: Identifying quantum structures in cognition and decision-making under uncertainty"],"references":["315454960_Towards_a_Quantum_World_Wide_Web","312925742_Quantum_Cognition_Beyond_Hilbert_Space_Fundamentals_and_Applications","281144824_On_Contextuality_in_Behavioral_Data","280695744_Spin_and_Wind_Directions_I_Identifying_Entanglement_in_Nature_and_Cognition","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","301817891_Quantum_Cognition_Beyond_Hilbert_Space_I_Fundamentals","288890386_On_the_Foundations_of_the_Brussels_Operational-Realistic_Approach_to_Cognition","285942923_Quantum_Models_of_Cognition_and_Decision","283274861_Loophole-free_Bell_inequality_violation_using_electron_spins_separated_by_13_kilometres","281084653_Beyond-Quantum_Modeling_of_Question_Order_Effects_and_Response_Replicability_in_Psychological_Measurements"]}
