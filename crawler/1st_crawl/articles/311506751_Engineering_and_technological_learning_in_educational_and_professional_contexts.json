{"id":"311506751_Engineering_and_technological_learning_in_educational_and_professional_contexts","abstract":"Following the drawn challenge of enhancing the discussion of young engineers' competences problematics, this paper reflects the result of the four different approaches from Ã˜stfold University College in Norway, University of Burgos in Spain and Polytechnic of Porto - School of Engineering in Portugal. The most common concern was in fact students' education in terms of their groundwork to face the real professional life. Some papers focus on the improvement of teaching methods in order to motivate students and address their interests, others focus on the development of parallel competences such as project managing, team work or communication skills. In one thing they all agree, nowadays graduate students face the enormous challenge of a very competitive professional world where their simple traditional scientific and technological skills may not be sufficient. This TEEM2016 track presents some diversify analysis and good practices, viewed from different perspectives: teachers, students and employers.","authors":["Clara Viegas","Maria Marques","Gustavo Ribeiro Alves"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1145/3012430.3012503","Conference: the Fourth International Conference"],"references":["308106730_Soft_skills_for_science_and_technology_students_A_pedagogical_experience","301453536_Engineering_and_technological_learning_in_educational_and_professional_contexts","228655175_Engineering_graduates'_perceptions_of_how_well_they_were_prepared_for_work_in_industry","2827447_The_Future_Of_Engineering_Education_IV_Learning_How_To_Teach","2628093_The_Future_Of_Engineering_Education_Ii_Teaching_Methods_That_Work","305067447_Disrupting_engineering_education_to_better_address_societal_needs","294797781_Leaders_will_make_the_future_of_aging","240524713_The_difficult_bridge_between_university_and_industry_A_case_study_in_computer_science_teaching"]}
