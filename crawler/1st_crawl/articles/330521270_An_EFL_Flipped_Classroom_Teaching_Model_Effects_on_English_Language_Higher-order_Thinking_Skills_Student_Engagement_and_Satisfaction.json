Also, it investigated the relationship between higher-order thinking skills, engagement and satisfaction. The sample comprised (67) graduate female students; an experimental group (N=33) and a control group (N=34), studying an English course at Taif University, KSA. The study used mixed method design; a pre-post HOTS test was carried out and two 5-Likert scale questionnaires had been designed and distributed; an engagement scale and a satisfaction scale. The findings of the study revealed statistically significant differences between the two group in HOTS in favor of the experimental group. Also, there was significant difference between the pre and post administration of the engagement scale in favor of the post administration. Moreover, students satisfaction on the (EFL-FCTM) was high. Finally, there were high significant relationships between HOTS and student engagement, HOTS and satisfaction and between student engagement and satisfaction.","authors":["Hamad Alsowat"],"meta":["January 2016","Project: Language"],"references":["349239619_The_Impact_of_Using_Flipped_Classroom_Instruction_on_the_Writing_Performance_of_Twelfth_Grade_Female_Emirati_Students_in_the_Applied_Technology_High_School_ATHS","340013380_Teaching_Poetry_through_Classroom_Flipping_among_Prospective_Teachers_in_a_College_of_Education_Action_Research_Report","300633976_BIM_postgraduate_multidisciplinary_collaborative_education","298787584_Journal_of_Education_and_e-Learning_Research_FLIPPED_A_Case_Study_in_Fundamental_of_Accounting_in_Malaysian_Polytechnic","297763402_Extending_the_flipped_classroom_model_Developing_second_language_writing_skills_through_student-created_digital_videos","285420355_The_Impact_of_Flipped_Classroom_on_Cognitive_Achievement_in_eLearning_Course_among_Students_from_the_Faculty_of_Education_at_King_Abdulaziz_University_Arabic","307744179_The_Impact_of_Flipped_Learning_on_Achievement_and_Attitudes_In_Higher_Education","301450941_Successful_EFL_teaching_using_mobile_technologies_in_a_flipped_classroom","287735302_Teacher-made_assessments_How_to_connect_curriculum_instruction_and_student_learning","286993943_Evidence_on_flipped_classrooms_is_still_coming_in"]}
