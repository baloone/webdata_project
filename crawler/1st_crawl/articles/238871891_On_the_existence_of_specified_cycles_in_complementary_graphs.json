{"id":"238871891_On_the_existence_of_specified_cycles_in_complementary_graphs","abstract":": Let c(m,n) be the least integer p such that for any graph G of order p, either G has an m-cycle or its complement G bar has an n-cycle. Values of c(m,n) are established for m,n = or < 6 and general formulas are presented for c(3,n), c(4,n), and c(5,n).
