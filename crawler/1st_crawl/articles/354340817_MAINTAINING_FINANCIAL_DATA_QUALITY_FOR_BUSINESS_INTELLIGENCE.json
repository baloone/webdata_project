{"id":"354340817_MAINTAINING_FINANCIAL_DATA_QUALITY_FOR_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE","abstract":"Only when the input data is reliable can mathematical models and business intelligence systems for decision-making produce accurate and effective outputs. However, data taken from primary sources and gathered in a data mart may contain several anomalies that analysts must identify and correct. This research covers the activities involved in creating a high-quality dataset for business intelligence and data mining. Three techniques are addressed to achieve this goal: data validation, which detects and reduce anomalies and inconsistencies; data modification, which enhances the precision and robustness of learning algorithms; and data reduction, which produces a set of data with fewer characteristics and records but is just as insightful as the original dataset.","authors":["Naveen Kunnathuvalappil Hariharan"],"meta":["December 2019"],"references":["300415236_Business_Reviews_Classification_Using_Sentiment_Analysis","273356787_Decision_making_in_the_context_of_business_intelligence_and_data_quality","236011248_Business_intelligence_success_The_roles_of_BI_capabilities_and_decision_environments","332464046_From_Data_to_Uncertainty_-_principles_of_data_quality","308871570_A_review_of_feature_selection_methods_with_applications","305377306_Business_intelligence_Concepts_components_techniques_and_benefits","290547197_Combining_business_intelligence_with_cloud_computing_to_delivery_agility_in_actual_economy","281891434_Feature_selection_A_literature_review","277800868_Mastering_the_sapR_business_information_warehouse_leveraging_the_business_intelligence_capabilities_of_sap_netweaver_second_edition","263323965_Data_mining_feature_selection_for_credit_scoring_models","234784019_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_Technologies","233508435_Drowning_in_dirty_data_It's_time_to_sink_or_swim_A_four-stage_methodology_for_total_data_quality_management","223861413_Selecting_the_most_efficient_maintenance_approach_using_fuzzy_multiple_criteria_decision_making","220688570_Journey_to_Data_Quality","31997176_Business_need_data_and_business_intelligence"]}
