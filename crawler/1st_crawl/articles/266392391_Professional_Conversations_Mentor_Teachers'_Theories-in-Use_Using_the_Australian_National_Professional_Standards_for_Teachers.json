{"id":"266392391_Professional_Conversations_Mentor_Teachers'_Theories-in-Use_Using_the_Australian_National_Professional_Standards_for_Teachers","abstract":"In this paper the written feedback provided by mentor teachers using a new assessment model for preservice teacher professional experience deployed in the Australian Capital Territory and based on the Australian National Standards for Teachers is analysed. The analysis reveals mentor teachers hold a pervasive theory-in-use in regards to the needs of beginning teachers that may restrict the developmental ambition of the assessment model. The restricted vision of what is important for beginning teachers held by mentor teachers is possibly a reaction to continual change within school education. The analysis is preceded by a description of the 'Professional Conversations' model for mentoring preservice and early career teachers.","authors":["Simon Leonard"],"meta":["December 2012Australian Journal of Teacher Education 37:Article 5","DOI:10.14221/ajte.2012v37n12.7"],"references":["267223848_The_Development_of_A_Literacy_of_Pedagogy_for_Preservice_Teacher_Education_Students","242578616_Toward_Expert_Thinking_How_curriculum_case_writing_prompts_the_development_of_theory-based_professional_knowledge_in_student_teachers","348866148_Reconstructing_Teaching_Standards_Performance_and_Accountability","325681448_'Professional_learning_that_makes_a_difference'_Successful_strategies_implemented_by_priority_action_schools_in_New_South_Wales","321502676_How_and_What_Teachers_Learn_A_Shifting_Perspective","270585208_Visible_Learning_for_Teachers_Maximising_Impact_on_Learning","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","249027791_Good_teachers_on_dangerous_ground_Towards_a_new_view_of_teacher_quality_and_professionalism","249002116_Teacher_Professional_Standards_Controlling_or_developing_teaching","248986036_How_and_What_Teachers_Learn_A_Shifting_Perspective"]}
