{"id":"322069370_Programming_Languages_in_Undergraduate_Courses_and_in_Software_Industry_in_Bulgaria","abstract":"Programming languages are one of the main knowledge areas in the Computer Science curriculum. Software development professionals often need to learn new languages, constructs and concepts to effectively combine them in solutions they develop. Universities must adequately prepare their students for the challenges they will face. Studying programming languages is a part of more general knowledge covering programming paradigms, concepts, technologies, patterns and algorithms. The first programming language plays and important role since freshmen have different backgrounds and different expectations. \nThis paper presents a recent survey on programming languages used in Bulgarian academic courses and discusses results in the light of the recent index of programming languages popularity and industry trends. The survey of languages studied at universities is juxtaposed with industry demands for professionals with specific knowledge in particular programming languages. The study covers all Bulgarian universities with undergraduate courses in the professional field of informatics and computer science and the programming skills demanded in job offers during the last six months in Bulgaria.","authors":["Ivo Damyanov","Nadezhda Borisova"],"meta":["December 2017International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 117(2)","DOI:10.12732/ijpam.v117i2.3"],"references":["309176375_Introductory_Programming_Subject_in_European_Higher_Education","236172121_Trends_in_Introductory_Programming_Courses_in_Australian_Universities_-_Languages_Environments_and_Pedagogy","286486004_Educational_influences_of_choice_of_first_programming_language","284886874_Programming_Language_Use_in_US_Academia_and_Industry","260829004_First_Programming_Language_-_Never-ending_Story"]}
