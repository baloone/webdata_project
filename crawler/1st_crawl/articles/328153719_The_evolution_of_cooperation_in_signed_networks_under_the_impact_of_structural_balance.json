{"id":"328153719_The_evolution_of_cooperation_in_signed_networks_under_the_impact_of_structural_balance","abstract":"Structural balance plays an important role in the dynamics of signed networks. Based on structural balance, we generalize the evolution of cooperation in signed networks. Here we develop a new simulation model to study the impact of structural balance on the evolution of cooperation in signed networks. The simulation shows that cooperation prevails when an individual has a higher probability of adjusting the signs of its relations. We also find that structural balance forces the coexistence of cooperators and defectors, while the initial attributes of networks have little impact on the evolution of cooperation in the presence of structural balance, although they have a strong effect on the evolution of structural balance.","authors":["Xiaochen He","Haifeng Du","Meng Cai","Marcus W Feldman"],"meta":["October 2018PLoS ONE 13(10):e0205084","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0205084"],"references":["325256573_Evolutionary_games_on_multilayer_networks_A_colloquium","321604362_Evolutionary_dynamics_of_cooperation_in_neutral_populations","320959099_Coevolution_of_Vertex_Weights_Resolves_Social_Dilemma_in_Spatial_Networks","317062237_Statistical_physics_of_human_cooperation","315696283_Onymity_promotes_cooperation_in_social_dilemma_experiments","307536753_Statistical_physics_of_vaccination","324469202_The_Prisoner's_Dilemma","322188396_Effects_of_compassion_on_the_evolution_of_cooperation_in_spatial_social_dilemmas","307556037_Optimizing_transformations_of_structural_balance_in_signed_networks_with_potential_relationships","304436452_The_logic_of_animal_conflict"]}
