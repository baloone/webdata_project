Even though education has also been permeated by the transformations of technology and the evolution of computer science, the affectation and curricula transformation is very low, especially in basic and secondary levels. Thus, in Colombia computer training continues being conceived as a complementary subject to other areas that seek the training of technology consumers rather than its creators. This work proposes a transformation strategy for computer training in primary and secondary education institutions, oriented towards the development of competences for Industry 4.0, focused on creative and computational thinking. This proposal has two key elements: curricular design, and didactic design as well as a Training Ecosystem in institutions at these levels.","authors":["Bell Manrique","Maria Clara Gomez","Liliana Gonz√°lez-Palacio"],"meta":["December 2020RISTI - Revista Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao","DOI:10.17013/risti.39.1-17"],"references":["327827830_Teaching_Computer_Science_Concepts_Through_Robotics_to_Elementary_School_Children","311425641_Expanding_computer_science_education_in_schools_Understanding_teacher_experiences_and_challenges","291373696_Dr_Scratch_Analisis_Automatico_de_Proyectos_Scratch_para_Evaluar_y_Fomentar_el_Pensamiento_Computacional","291366551_Pensamiento_Computacional_a_traves_de_la_Programacion_Paradigma_de_Aprendizaje","262436198_El_impacto_de_las_nuevas_tecnologias_en_la_educacion_en_valores_del_siglo_XXI","28113204_Estrategias_de_aprendizaje_autoconcepto_y_rendimiento_academico","26584705_Ecosystem-based_Theoretical_Models_for_Learning_in_Environments_of_the_21st_Century","301737088_Connectivism_A_knowledge_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age","295908640_Informatica_materia_esencial_en_la_educacion_obligatoria_del_siglo_XXI","28098470_Nueva_universidad_ante_la_Sociedad_del_Conocimiento"]}
