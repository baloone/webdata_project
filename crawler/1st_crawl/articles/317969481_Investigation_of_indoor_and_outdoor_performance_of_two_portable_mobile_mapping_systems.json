{"id":"317969481_Investigation_of_indoor_and_outdoor_performance_of_two_portable_mobile_mapping_systems","abstract":"The paper investigates the performances of two portable mobile mapping systems (MMSs), the handheld GeoSLAM ZEB-REVO and Leica Pegasus:Backpack, in two typical user-case scenarios: an indoor two-floors building and an outdoor open city square. The indoor experiment is characterized by smooth and homogenous surfaces and reference measurements are acquired with a time-of-flight (ToF) phase-shift laser scanner. The noise of the two MMSs is estimated through the fitting of geometric primitives on simple constructive elements, such as horizontal and vertical planes and cylindrical columns. Length measurement errors on different distances measured on the acquired point clouds are also reported. The outdoor tests are compared against a MMSs mounted on a car and a robust statistical analysis, entailing the estimation of both standard Gaussian and non-parametric estimators, is presented to assess the accuracy potential of both portable systems.","authors":["Erica Nocerino","Fabio Menna","Fabio Remondino","Isabella Toschi"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1117/12.2270761","Conference: SPIE Optical Metrology","Project: Performance evaluation of portable mobile mapping systems (MMSs)"],"references":["313963223_Mobile_LiDAR_System_New_Possibilities_for_the_Documentation_and_Dissemination_of_Large_Cultural_Heritage_Sites","307531388_QUALITY_ANALYSIS_AND_CORRECTION_OF_MOBILE_BACKPACK_LASER_SCANNING_DATA","285485561_An_Integrated_Flexible_Self-calibration_Approach_for_2D_Laser_Scanning_Range_Finders_Applied_to_the_Hokuyo_UTM-30LX-EW","283284073_Evaluation_of_a_Backpack-Mounted_3D_Mobile_Scanning_System","283184325_A_MAN-PORTABLE_IMU-FREE_MOBILE_MAPPING_SYSTEM","274780423_Three-Dimensional_Mobile_Mapping_of_Caves","273203539_Accuracy_evaluation_of_a_mobile_mapping_system_with_advanced_statistical_methods","265420322_Confronting_Passive_and_Active_Sensors_with_Non-Gaussian_Statistics","261348888_Exploration_and_mapping_of_catacombs_with_mobile_robots","260558095_Efficient_Large-scale_Three-dimensional_Mobile_Mapping_for_Underground_Mines"]}
