{"id":"235709725_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Parameters_and_Methods_to_Tune_Them","abstract":"In this chapter we discuss the notion of Evolutionary Algorithm (EAs) parameters and propose a distinction between EAs and EA instances, based on the type of parameters used to specify their details. Furthermore, we consider the most important aspects of the parameter tuning problem and give an overview of existing parameter tuning methods. Finally, we elaborate on the methodological issues involved here and provide recommendations for further development. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
