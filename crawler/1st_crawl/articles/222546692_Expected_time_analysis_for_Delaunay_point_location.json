{"id":"222546692_Expected_time_analysis_for_Delaunay_point_location","abstract":"We consider point location in Delaunay triangulations with the aid of simple data structures. In particular, we analyze methods in which a simple data structure is used to first locate a point close to the query point. For points uniformly distributed on the unit square, we show that the expected point location complexities are for the Green–Sibson rectilinear search, Θ(n1/3) for Jump and Walk, Θ(n1/4) for BinSearch and Walk (which uses a 1-dimensional search tree), Θ(n0.056…) for search based on a random 2-d tree, and Θ(logn) for search aided by a 2-d median tree.","authors":["Luc Devroye","Christophe Lemaire","Jean-Michel Moreau"],"meta":["October 2004Computational Geometry 29(2):61-89","DOI:10.1016/j.comgeo.2004.02.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262270905_Squarish_k_-_d_Trees","226544185_Splitting_a_Delaunay_Triangulation_in_Linear_Time","225386633_A_Note_on_Point_Location_in_Delaunay_Triangulations_of_Random_Points","221590183_Primitives_for_the_Manipulation_of_General_Subdivisions_and_the_Computation_of_Voronoi_Diagrams","220770834_Splitting_a_Delaunay_Triangulation_in_Linear_Time","220669978_The_expected_extremes_in_a_Delaunay_triangulation","220492503_Optimal_Expected-Time_Algorithms_for_Closest_Point_Problems","220198132_Analysis_of_range_search_for_random_k-d_trees","43606149_Fully_dynamic_Delaunay_triangulation_in_logarithmic_expected_time_per_operation","2926287_Walking_in_a_Triangulation","266978578_Combinatorial_algorithms_Theory_and_practice_Algorytmy_kombinatoryczne_Transl_from_the_English_by_Konrad_Karpinski_and_Lidia_Rosicka","262092548_Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures_In_Pascal_and_C","262090816_A_Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures","261179979_Introduction_to_Algorithms_Third_Edition","247572109_Software_for_C1_Surface_Interpolation","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","247338065_Re_nements_to_nearest-neighbor_searching_in_k-d_trees","242914287_Refinements_to_nearest-neighbor_searching_in_k-dimensional_trees","242473725_Triangulation_de_Delaunay_et_arbres_multidimensionnels","242419083_Computing_Dirichlet_Tesselations_in_the_Plane","242360974_Multidimensional_binary_tree_used_for_associative_searching","238757983_The_art_o_computer_programming_vol_i","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","234811237_Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures","233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities","227103268_Randomized_incremental_construction_of_Delaunay_and_Voronoi_diagrams","226548937_Randomized_incremental_construction_of_Delaunay_and_Voronoi_diagrams","225350019_Some_inequalities_relating_to_the_partial_sum_of_binomial_probabilities","225195364_An_all-round_sweep_algorithm_for_2-dimensional_nearest-neighbor_problems","222881949_Intersections_with_random_geometric_objects","222458784_On_The_Randomized_Construction_Of_The_Delaunay_Tree","221591109_Binary_Search_Trees_of_Bounded_Balance","220983863_Fast_Randomized_Point_Location_without_Preprocessing_in_Two-_and_Three-Dimensional_Delaunay_Triangulations","220574043_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Hamiltonian_Circuits_and_Matchings","220536442_The_Height_of_Binary_Search_Trees","220424200_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching_Communications_of_the_ACM_189_509-517","31048548_Computing_Dirichlet_Tessellations_in_the_Plane","30867879_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching","29650528_The_Delaunay_Hierarchy","2428899_Fast_Delaunay_point_location_with_search_structures","2112731_Some_Extensions_of_an_Inequality_of_Vapnik_and_Chervonenkis"]}
