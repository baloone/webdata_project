{"id":"294278277_Nanocaged_enzymes_with_enhanced_catalytic_activity_and_increased_stability_against_protease_digestion","abstract":"Cells routinely compartmentalize enzymes for enhanced efficiency of their metabolic pathways. Here we report a general approach to construct DNA nanocaged enzymes for enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Nanocaged enzymes are realized by self-assembly into DNA nanocages with well-controlled stoichiometry and architecture that enabled a systematic study of the impact of both encapsulation and proximal polyanionic surfaces on a set of common metabolic enzymes. Activity assays at both bulk and single-molecule levels demonstrate increased substrate turnover numbers for DNA nanocage-encapsulated enzymes. Unexpectedly, we observe a significant inverse correlation between the size of a protein and its activity enhancement. This effect is consistent with a model wherein distal polyanionic surfaces of the nanocage enhance the stability of active enzyme conformations through the action of a strongly bound hydration layer. We further show that DNA nanocages protect encapsulated enzymes against proteases, demonstrating their practical utility in functional biomaterials and biotechnology.","authors":["Zhao Zhao","Jinglin Fu","Soma Dhakal","Alex Johnson-Buck"],"meta":["February 2016Nature Communications 7(1):10619","DOI:10.1038/ncomms10619","Project: Biomimetic self-assembly"],"references":["270832551_A_modular_DNA_origami-based_enzyme_cascade_nanoreactor","295169929_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_Nanoscale_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","289554382_Location_location_location","276831313_Tuning_Enzyme_Kinetics_through_Designed_Intermolecular_Interactions_Far_from_the_Active_Site","275527999_Assembly_and_Purification_of_Enzyme-Functionalized_DNA_Origami_Structures","265608946_Single-molecule_tools_for_enzymology_structural_biology_systems_biology_and_nanotechnology_an_update","263958262_Kinetic_Enhancements_in_DNA-Enzyme_Nanostructures_Mimic_the_Sabatier_Principle","262610553_Multi-enzyme_complexes_on_DNA_scaffolds_capable_of_substrate_channelling_with_an_artificial_swinging_arm","260373707_Polyphosphate_Is_a_Primordial_Chaperone","258146197_Temperature_Controlled_Encapsulation_and_Release_of_an_Active_Enzyme_in_the_Cavity_of_a_Self-Assembled_DNA_Nano-Cage"]}
