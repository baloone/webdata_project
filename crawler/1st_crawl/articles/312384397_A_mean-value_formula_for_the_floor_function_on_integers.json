{"id":"312384397_A_mean-value_formula_for_the_floor_function_on_integers","abstract":"The paper ï¿½rst proves several inequalities related with the floor function, and then deduces and proves a mean-value formula for the floor function with an integer variable. The inequalities and the formulae are useful in some aspects related to analysis and computation of the floor function.","authors":["Xingbo Wang"],"meta":["June 2012"],"references":["295186385_FUNCTIONS_RELATED_TO_BINARY_REPRESENTATION_OF_INTEGERS","324305433_Solved_and_Unsolved_Problems_in_Number_Theory","265372461_Solved_and_Unsolved_Problems_in_Number_Theory","238316697_Series_Associated_with_the_Zeta_and_Related_Functions","220693520_Concrete_Mathematics_A_Foundation_for_Computer_Science"]}
