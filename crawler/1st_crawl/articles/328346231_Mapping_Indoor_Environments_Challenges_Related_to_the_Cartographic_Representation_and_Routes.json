{"id":"328346231_Mapping_Indoor_Environments_Challenges_Related_to_the_Cartographic_Representation_and_Routes","abstract":"Only recently the representation of indoor environments got the attention of the researchers. Earlier studies on indoor visualization have focused primarily either on static, printed emergency maps or maps on early mobile´s prototypes. Besides that, a great part of the research has been directed to positioning methods. Therefore, we are investigating some important issues about the indoor representations, such as which is the best map design. The first aspect addressed in this research is about the map design for an indoor environment and how it can be produced. We applied a semi-automatic method to create the database with the features that are present in each one of the maps. The second aspect is related to indoor routing and a PostGIS extension – PgRouting - was adapted to allows the route calculation, considering not only the indoor space but also its use to navigate from one building to another, even if it is necessary a floor changing.","authors":["Luciene Stamato Delazari","Leonardo Ercolin Filho","Rhaissa Sarot","Pedro Paulo Farias"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-813189-3.00009-5","In book: GEOGRAPHICAL AND FINGERPRINTING DATA TO CREATE SYSTEMS FOR INDOOR POSITIONING AND INDOOR/OUTDOOR NAVIGATION (pp.169)Publisher: ELSEVIER","Project: CampusMap"],"references":["269710174_Problems_In_Indoor_Mapping_and_Modelling","268521869_Evaluation_of_subjective_preferences_regarding_indoor_maps_comparison_of_schematic_maps_and_floor_plans","268003042_Mind_the_Map_The_Impact_of_Transit_Maps_on_Travel_Decisions_in_Public_Transit","228736296_Automated_schematic_map_production_using_simulated_annealing_and_gradient_descent_approaches","226163713_A_Survey_of_Mobile_Indoor_Navigation_Systems","297519096_Location-based_services","272310681_Developing_a_Framework_for_Describing_and_Comparing_Indoor_Maps","261622300_IndoorTubes_A_Novel_Design_for_Indoor_Maps","258132443_Spatial_Factors_Affecting_Wayfinding_and_Orientation_A_Case_Study_in_a_Shopping_Mall","228508765_You_Are_Where_The_Function_and_Frustration_of_You-Are-Here_Yah_Maps"]}
