{"id":"258737544_A_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_the_Faculty_Assignment_Problem","abstract":"In this paper we describe a heuristic-based algorithm for the faculty assignment problem. The algorithm was designed and implemented as part of a graduation project in the IT department of King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The purpose of the project was to automate the manual tedious process of assigning TAs (Teaching Assistants) to suitable lab sessions; a task that needs to be done every semester in the IT department. The algorithm was designed to fulfill the assignment task while taking into consideration a number of constraints pertaining to both the TAs (e.g. personal preference and available hours) and the IT department (e.g. maximum allowed workload). The problem definition, the algorithm, and the experimental results are thoroughly explained in this paper. The computational experimentation indicate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in assigning courses that conform to the preferences of the TAs and the rules set forth by the IT department.","authors":["Manar I.
