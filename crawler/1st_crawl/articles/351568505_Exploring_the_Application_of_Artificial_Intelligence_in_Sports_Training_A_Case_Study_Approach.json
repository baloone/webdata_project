{"id":"351568505_Exploring_the_Application_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Sports_Training_A_Case_Study_Approach","abstract":"With the rapid development of computer science and information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed from theory to application. As a key technology in the modern society, AI is increasingly affecting all aspects of people’s daily lives, including sports training. AI can be considered as an assistive technology to provide specific support to athletes’ physical education training through various means such as data analysis and simulation of training scenarios. Although research on AI is still in the preliminary stage, it is significant to explore how AI can be applied in sports training since this emerging technology could facilitate people’s physical training to some extent. This paper first reviews the existing research on AI applications. Then, based on the fundamental concept and related research results of AI, this study explores three specific cases of AI application in sports training and explains the main principles. This research focuses on discussing the strong relationship between AI technology and physical education training and highlights the advantages of AI, including utilization, convenience, and innovation.","authors":["Shiqing Wei","Puquan Huang","Rui Li","Zhiguo Liu"],"meta":["May 2021Complexity 2021(8):1-8","DOI:10.1155/2021/4658937"],"references":["350044938_Assistant_Training_System_of_Teenagers'_Physical_Ability_Based_on_Artificial_Intelligence","348615080_Forecast_of_Freight_Volume_in_Xi'an_Based_on_Gray_GM_1_1_Model_and_Markov_Forecasting_Model","348202414_Applying_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Physical_Education_and_Future_Perspectives","347669240_A_Decision-Making_Model_Using_Machine_Learning_for_Improving_Dispatching_Efficiency_in_Chengdu_Shuangliu_Airport","345868535_Research_and_Analysis_of_Sports_Training_Real-Time_Monitoring_System_Based_on_Mobile_Artificial_Intelligence_Terminal","344627097_Evolutionary_Game_Simulation_on_Government_Incentive_Strategies_of_Prefabricated_Construction_A_System_Dynamics_Approach","349169217_Visual_relationship_detection_with_region_topology_structure","349026243_Role_of_artificial_intelligence_algorithm_for_taekwondo_teaching_effect_evaluation_model","346118250_An_artificial_intelligence_based_model_for_evaluation_of_college_students'_ability_and_characteristics_through_teaching_evaluation","342215931_Competing_in_the_Age_of_AI_Strategy_and_Leadership_When_Algorithms_and_Networks_Run_the_World"]}
