{"id":"348717181_Innovation_beyond_optimization_Application_to_cutting_tool_design","abstract":"During the development of a product, several steps and iterations are necessary for meeting specifications and optimizing performance criteria. This article address machining problem, that are faced to increasing constraints and performance criteria. A multi-objective optimization approach is a common approach for determining a solution that meets all these constraints. The Design of Experiments (DoE) is used for modeling and understanding of the process with a minimum of experiences. When the multi-objective optimization approach demonstrates that, for a given design, no single solution exists that optimizes all objectives, the best partial solutions belong to the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this study, a global approach for determining the optimal solution from a DoE and overcoming this optimum by the complementary use of TRIZ-based methods is proposed. In the proposed approach, optimization and inventive methods are linked. The proposed approach aims to exploit the data from multi-objective optimization and the concept of Pareto optimums to identify ways of modifying a system to respond to more objectives. A new definition of the system of generalized contradictions, which is more complete than previous definitions, is used in the proposed method. This proposal is an illustration of a global research project that aims at linking optimization and inventive methods. An application of this method is proposed for the design of a new cutting tool for the machining of composite materials. Furthermore, the limitations of the method, which proves to be satisfactory in comparison with previously proposed methods, are discussed.","authors":["Hicham Chibane","SÃ©bastien Dubois","Roland DE GUIO"],"meta":["January 2021Computers & Industrial Engineering 154(107139)","DOI:10.1016/j.cie.2021.107139"],"references":["332455961_Study_of_an_innovative_method_based_on_complementarity_between_ARIZ_lean_management_and_discrete_event_simulation_for_solving_warehousing_problems","327333006_Multi-objective_optimization_of_cutting_parameters_for_turning_AISI_52100_hardened_steel","312151499_Optimal_milling_conditions_of_aeronautical_composite_material_under_temperature_forces_and_vibration_parameters","304299714_Theory_of_inventive_problem_solving_TRIZ_his-story","257454878_Machining_carbon_fibre_reinforced_plastics_Lead_angle_effect","257337725_Optimal_milling_conditions_for_carbonepoxy_composite_material_using_damage_and_vibration_analysis","229380050_From_design_optimization_systems_to_geometrical_contradictions","228904365_Drilling_tool_geometry_evaluation_for_reinforced_composite_laminates","226795670_Representing_and_selecting_problems_through_contradictions_clouds","223926551_A_dialectical_based_model_coherent_with_inventive_and_optimization_problems","222676081_Delamination_analysis_of_carbon_fibre_reinforced_laminates_Evaluation_of_a_special_step_drill","287500095_Machining_of_Polymer_Composites","280939936_'On_the_Experimental_Attainment_Optimum_Conditions'","280939853_Creativity_As_an_Exact_Science","280939851_The_Innovation_Algorithm_TRIZ_Systematic_Innovation_and_Technical_Creativity","273243768_An_exact_algorithm_to_extract_the_generalized_physical_contradiction","273243672_Algorithm_for_identifying_generalized_technical_contradictions_in_experiments","265586089_Response_surfaces_mixtures_and_ridge_analyses_2nd_revised_ed_of_the_book_previously_published_under_the_title_Empirical_model-building_and_response_surfaces","246882888_MultiFactor_Experimental_Designs_for_Exploring_Response_Surfaces","234021438_Applied_Multiple_RegressionCorrelation_Analysis_For_The_Behavioral_Sciences","225609216_Optimisation_of_Surface_Roughness_on_Turning_Fibre_Reinforced_Plastics_FRPs_With_Diamond_Cutting_Tools","223546204_Delamination_in_drilling_GFR-thermoset_composites","222991831_Damage_and_dimensional_precision_on_milling_carbon_fiber-reinforced_plastics_using_design_experiments","220171030_A_Framework_for_OTSM-TRIZ_Based_Computer_Support_to_be_used_in_Complex_Problem_Management"]}
