{"id":"326378232_An_Architecture_for_the_Development_of_Ambient_Intelligence_Systems_Managed_by_Embedded_Agents","abstract":"Ubiquitous systems consider the use of electronic components for enhancing daily objects with some kind of computational intelligence for aiding users in their tasks pervasively. Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a branch of ubiquitous computing that provides an environment full of interconnected devices and it can provide data communication, inference mechanism based on context information and collaboration among system's devices. Similarly, the Internet of Things (IoT) provides uniquely identified devices or things in a network for helping users in their activities. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are intelligent systems where agents are responsible for reasoning, competing and using resources to achieve desirable goals pro-actively and autonomously. Agents have been employed in some approaches and works during the last years, but none of them considered embedded MAS responsible for smart devices in an AmI system running over an IoT network. Besides, it is also interesting that agents of the embedded MAS can interact, sharing information with agents situated in another embedded MAS using the IoT network to learn from user's experiences. This paper proposes an architecture for the development of AmI systems using embedded MAS for interfacing with sensors and actuators in a heterogenous network using an IoT middleware.","authors":["Carlos Eduardo Pantoja","Heder Dorneles Soares","Jose Viterbo","Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.18293/SEKE2018-110","Conference: Software Engineering & Knowledge EngineeringAt: San Francisco/USA"],"references":["324952954_FTSP_A_MAC_Timestamp_independent_flooding_time_synchronization_protocol","303009760_ARGO_A_Customized_Jason_Architecture_for_Programming_Embedded_Robotic_Agents","277403727_A_Robotic-agent_Platform_for_Embedding_Software_Agents_Using_Raspberry_Pi_and_Arduino_Boards","269690837_MR-UDP_Yet_another_Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol_now_for_Mobile_Nodes","268151893_Enhancing_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT_via_the_Concept_of_Agent_of_Things_AoT","313730983_The_computer_for_the_21st_century","311692258_ARGO_An_Extended_Jason_Architecture_that_Facilitates_Embedded_Robotic_Agents_Programming","308672058_Towards_a_Software_Framework_for_the_Autonomous_Internet_of_Things","283288951_Applying_an_Unified_Access_Control_for_IoT-based_Intelligent_Agent_Systems","272497569_A_Multi-Agent_Architecture_to_Support_Ubiquitous_Applications_in_Smart_Environments"]}
