{"id":"281525434_Towards_Events_Recognition_in_a_Distributed_Fiber-Optic_Sensor_System_Kolmogorov-Zurbenko_Filtering","abstract":"The paper is about de-noising procedures aimed on events recognition in\nsignals from a distributed fiber-optic vibration sensor system based on the\nphase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry. We report experimental\nresults on recognition of several classes of events in a seismic background. A\nde-noising procedure uses the framework of the time-series analysis and\nKolmogorov-Zurbenko filtering. We demonstrate that this approach allows\nrevealing signatures of several classes of events.","authors":["A. K.
