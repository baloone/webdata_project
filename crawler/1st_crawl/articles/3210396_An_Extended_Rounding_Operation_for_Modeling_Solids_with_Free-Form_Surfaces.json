{"id":"3210396_An_Extended_Rounding_Operation_for_Modeling_Solids_with_Free-Form_Surfaces","abstract":"An extended rounding operation can be an excellent tool for modeling solids with free-form surfaces. Using the rounding operation, the edges and vertices of a solid can be locally rounded, and those parts of the solid are changed to free-form surfaces. As a user, you put in information about edges that should be rounded and the radii of curves generated by the operation. This facility has been implemented in our solid modeling system, Desiqnbase.","authors":["Hiroaki Chiyokura"],"meta":["January 1988IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine: the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society 7(12):27-36","DOI:10.1109/MCG.1987.276936","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["299872665_A_Representation_of_Solid_Design_Process_Using_Basic_Operations","262254295_Localized_Surface_Interpolation_Method_for_Irregular_Meshes","256152244_Clark_J_Recursively_generated_b-spline_surfaces_on_arbitrary_topological_meshes_Computer-Aided_Design_106_350-355","247366924_Recursively_Generated_B-Spline_Surfaces_on_Arbitrary_Topological_Meshes","243787603_The_Alpha_1_computer-aided_geometric_design_system_in_the_Unix_environment","243551495_A_view_of_spline-based_solid_modelling","242589629_A_subdivision_algorithm_for_smoothing_down_irregular_shaped_polyhedrons","242545123_Free_form_surfaces_in_gm_solid_goals_and_issues","239616857_Generation_of_high_order_surfaces_over_arbitrary_polyhedral_meshes","234831334_Design_of_Solids_with_Free-Form_Surfaces","234795400_Smoothing_of_polyhedral_models","226580455_Design_and_Computer_Aided_Design_of_3DIC","222448665_Behavior_of_recursive_division_surfaces_near_extraordinary_points","222051686_Smoothing_of_shapes_designed_with_free-form_surfaces","220720254_Blend_surfaces_for_set_theoretic_volume_modeling_systems","220221174_Bicubic_patches_for_approximating_non-rectangular_control-point_meshes","220067663_Automatic_surface_generation_in_computer_aided_design","3210261_Undo_and_Redo_Operations_for_Solid_Modeling","3209874_Set-Theoretic_Volume_Model_Evaluation_and_Picture-Plane_Coherence"]}
