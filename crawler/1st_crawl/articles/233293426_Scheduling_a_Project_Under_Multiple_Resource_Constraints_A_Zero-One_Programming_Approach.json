{"id":"233293426_Scheduling_a_Project_Under_Multiple_Resource_Constraints_A_Zero-One_Programming_Approach","abstract":"An implicit enumeration (zero-one programming) algorithm is described for solving the multiple-constrained resource, project scheduling problem. The algorithm developed takes special advantage of the structure of the zero-one formulation, resulting in a significant decrease in the amount of computation time required to solve a given multi-resonance problem. A description of the computer program for implementing the procedures developed is provided, as are detailed computation results. Because the multiple-constrained resource, project scheduling problem subsumes the job-shop scheduling and other related sequencing problems, extensions of our approach to the machine sequencing problem (along with limited computation results) are also reported.","authors":["James H.
