{"id":"315782086_Blind_Signal_Detection_in_Massive_MIMO_Exploiting_the_Channel_Sparsity","abstract":"This paper considers a massive MIMO system, where K single-antenna transmit terminals communicate with an N-antenna receiver. By massive MIMO, we assume N>> K >> 1. We propose a novel blind detection scheme by exploiting the channel sparsity inherent to the angular domain of the receive antenna array. We show that the overhead for channel acquisition can be largely compensated by the potential gain due to the channel sparsity. To this end, we propose a novel blind detection scheme that simultaneously estimates the channel and data by factorizing the received signal matrix. We show that by exploiting the channel sparsity, our proposed scheme can achieve a DoF arbitrarily close to K(1-1/T) with T being the channel coherence time, provided that N is sufficiently large and the channel is sufficiently sparse. This achievable DoF has a fractional gap of only 1/T from the ideal DoF of K, which is a remarkable advance for understanding the performance limit of the massive MIMO system. We further show that the performance advantage of our proposed scheme in the asymptotic SNR regime carries over to the practical SNR regime. In specific, we present an efficient message-passing algorithm to jointly estimate the channel and detect the data via matrix factorization. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms its counterpart schemes in the practical SNR regime under various system configurations.","authors":["Jianwen Zhang","Xiaojun Yuan","Ying Jun","Minglong Zhang"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2761384"],"references":["311299540_Blind_Estimation_of_Sparse_Multi-User_Massive_MIMO_Channels","265729954_Efficient_Coordinated_Recovery_of_Sparse_Channels_in_Massive_MIMO","264123188_Sparse_and_Spurious_Dictionary_Learning_With_Noise_and_Outliers","257069462_Blind_Pilot_Decontamination","244426534_Experimental_Study_of_MIMO_Channel_Statistics_and_Capacity_via_Virtual_Channel_Representation","236274573_Massive_MIMO_for_Next_Generation_Wireless_Systems","224133697_Compressed_Channel_Sensing_A_New_Approach_to_Estimating_Sparse_Multipath_Channels","45865402_Online_Learning_for_Matrix_Factorization_and_Sparse_Coding","38037817_Message_Passing_Algorithms_for_Compressed_Sensing","3433933_Cluster_Characteristics_in_a_MIMO_Indoor_Propagation_Environment","3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation","3318421_Deconstructing_multiantenna_fading_channels","3318348_Subspace-based_blind_and_semi-blind_channel_estimation_for_OFDM_systems","3084685_How_much_training_is_needed_in_multiple-antenna_wireless_links","3080069_The_effect_upon_channel_capacity_in_wireless_communications_of_perfect_and_imperfect_knowledge_of_the_channel","304579006_3-D_Millimeter-Wave_Statistical_Channel_Model_for_5G_Wireless_System_Design","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","285458608_Fundamental_Limits_of_Training-Based_Multiuser_MIMO_Systems","283761603_Complete_Dictionary_Recovery_Over_the_Sphere_I_Overview_and_the_Geometric_Picture","282831429_Non-Regenerative_Cellular_Two-Way_Relaying_with_Large-Scale_Antenna_Arrays","262528232_Distributed_compressive_CSIT_estimation_and_feedback_for_FDD_multi-user_massive_MIMO_systems","261090709_EVD-based_Channel_Estimations_for_Multicell_Multiuser_MIMO_with_Very_Large_Antenna_Arrays","260672991_Energy_and_Spectral_Efficiency_of_Very_Large_Multiuser_MIMO_Systems","260635439_Massive_MIMO_in_the_ULDL_of_cellular_networks_How_many_antennas_do_we_need","258327329_Near-ideal_model_selection_by_ell_1_minimization","228060130_Exact_Recovery_of_Sparsely-Used_Dictionaries","224180963_Noncooperative_Cellular_Wireless_with_Unlimited_Numbers_of_Base_Station_Antennas","221960626_A_Coordinated_Approach_to_Channel_Estimation_in_Large-Scale_Multiple-Antenna_Systems","220679453_Communication_on_the_Grassmann_Manifold_A_Geometric_Approach_to_the_Noncoherent_Multiple-Antenna_Channel","3434209_RAKE_Receiver_for_Channels_with_a_Sparse_Impulse_Response","3320510_Training-based_MIMO_systems_-_Part_I_Performance_comparison","3019419_Measurement_of_Large-Scale_Cluster_Power_Characteristics_for_Geometric_Channel_Models","2817169_Capacity_of_Multi-Antenna_Gaussian_Channels"]}
