{"id":"343221955_Design_and_development_of_the_online_career_counselling_a_tool_for_better_career_decision-making","abstract":"Nowadays, students experience career problems, such as the transition from university to the labour market where they need the career counselling services. Accordingly, it was attempted to design an online career counselling tool and provide services and guidance for students in career fields. This study was conducted in three parts in 2019. In the first part, the career counselling website was designed. In the second part, using the opinions of the experts (20 career counselling experts and 20 software engineering specialists), the website efficiency was assessed, and, in the third part, to conduct the online career counselling, 45 students were assigned into the online counselling, the face-to-face groups, and the control groups to compare their career decision-makings at the pretest and the post-test. The results showed that it is possible to design the online career counselling. Also, according to the results of the third part, the face-to-face and the online groups, compared with the control group, showed a significant and positive mean in the career decision-making. It can be said that the online counselling can be used besides the face-to-face counselling at those universities and educational centres that deal with students to prepare them for career fields.","authors":["Nooshin Pordelan","Simin Hosseinian"],"meta":["July 2020Behaviour and Information
