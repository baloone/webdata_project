{"id":"263906983_SEPARATING_POINT_SETS_IN_POLYGONAL_ENVIRONMENTS","abstract":"We consider the separability of two point sets inside a polygon by means of chords or geodesic lines. Specifically, given a set of red points and a set of blue points in the interior of a polygon, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a chord and for the existence of a geodesic path that separate the two sets; when they exist we also derive efficient algorithms for their obtention. We also study the separation of the two sets using the minimum number of pairwise non-crossing chords.","authors":["Erik D.demaine","Jefferickson","Ferranhurtado","Johniacono"],"meta":["November 2011International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications 15(04)","DOI:10.1142/S0218195905001762"],"references":["225798601_Computing_the_Geodesic_Center_of_a_Simple_Polygon","220482062_Computing_Largest_Circles_Separating_Two_Sets_of_Segments","2752790_A_New_Approach_for_the_Geodesic_Voronoi_Diagram_of_Points_in_a_Simple_Polygon_and_Other_Restricted_Polygonal_Domains","270793839_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees_of_Functions_with_Finite_Domains","240062136_Investigations_in_Geometric_Subdivi-sions_Linear_Shattering_and_Cartographic_Map_Coloring","237128357_Circular_separability_of_planar_point_sets","225835247_On_the_geodesic_Voronoi_diagram_of_point_sites_in_a_simple_polygon","225791910_The_furthest-site_geodesic_Voronoi_diagram","222470977_Optimal_Shortest_Path_Queries_in_a_Simple_Polygon","222457635_Minimum_polygonal_separation","220779161_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_on_the_Grid","220617849_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees_with_Integer_Inputs","220617278_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Linear_Programming_in_R","220574622_Computing_Geodesic_Furthest_Neighbors_in_Simple_Polygons","220442375_How_to_draw_a_planar_graph_on_a_grid","35972993_Investigations_in_geometric_subdivisions_linear_shattering_and_cartographic_map_coloring","4355300_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Linear_Programming_in_R3_and_Related_Problems","2907862_Geodesic_Ham-Sandwich_Cuts","2882556_Separating_Objects_in_the_Plane_By_Wedges_and_Strips"]}
