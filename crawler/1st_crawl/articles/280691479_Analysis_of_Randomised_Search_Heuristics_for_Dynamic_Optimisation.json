{"id":"280691479_Analysis_of_Randomised_Search_Heuristics_for_Dynamic_Optimisation","abstract":"Dynamic optimisation is an area of application where randomised search heuristics like evolutionary algorithms and artificial immune systems are often successful. The theoretical foundation of this important topic suffers from a lack of a generally accepted analytical framework as well as a lack of widely accepted example problems. This article tackles both problems by discussing necessary conditions for useful and practically relevant theoretical analysis as well as introducing a concrete family of dynamic example problems that draws inspiration from a well-known static example problem and exhibits a bi-stable dynamic. After setting the stage this way the framework is made concrete by presenting the results of thorough theoretical and statistical analysis for mutation-based evolutionary algorithms and artificial immune systems.","authors":["Thomas Jansen","Christine Zarges"],"meta":["August 2015Evolutionary Computation 23(4)","DOI:10.1162/EVCO_a_00164","SourcePubMed"],"references":["262495155_Evolutionary_Dynamic_Optimization_A_Survey_of_the_State_of_the_art","254462323_Bioinspired_computation_in_combinatorial_optimization_-_Algorithms_and_their_computational_complexity","220742624_Immune_Inspired_Somatic_Contiguous_Hypermutation_for_Function_Optimisation","220741485_Dynamic_evolutionary_optimisation_an_analysis_of_frequency_and_magnitude_of_change","220701480_An_Analysis_of_the_XOR_Dynamic_Problem_Generator_Based_on_the_Dynamical_System","321525554_Bioinspired_Computation_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","316801003_Natural_Computing_Series","308646685_Analysis_of_diversity_mechanisms_for_optimisation_in_dynamic_environments_with_low_frequencies_of_change","304637709_MMAS_Versus_Population-Based_EA_on_a_Family_of_Dynamic_Fitness_Functions","300581359_11_EA_on_Generalized_Dynamic_OneMax","300581101_Fixed_Budget_Performance_of_the_11_EA_on_Linear_Functions","269092163_Dynamic_evolutionary_optimisation","269057619_Bioinspired_computation_in_combinatorial_optimization_-_Algorithms_and_their_computational_complexity","267444250_The_simple_genetic_algorithm_Foundations_and_theory","266656429_Evolutionary_algorithms_and_artificial_immune_systems_on_a_bi-stable_dynamic_optimisation_problem","266656418_MMAS_Versus_Population-Based_EA_on_a_Family_of_Dynamic_Fitness_Functions","266205889_Reevaluating_Immune-Inspired_Hypermutations_Using_the_Fixed_Budget_Perspective","266174287_Analyzing_evolutionary_algorithms_The_computer_science_perspective","265828882_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_Nearly_Uncoupled_Markov_Chains","263892352_Performance_analysis_of_randomised_search_heuristics_operating_with_a_fixed_budget","263012509_Analysis_of_fitness_landscape_modifications_in_evolutionary_dynamic_optimization","262568130_A_Fixed_Budget_Analysis_of_Randomized_Search_Heuristics_for_the_Traveling_Salesp_erson_Problem","262493812_Evolutionary_Computation_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","262362108_Runtime_analysis_of_ant_colony_optimization_on_dynamic_shortest_path_problems","262333616_Analyzing_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems_Based_on_the_Dynamical_Systems_Approach","262323970_ACO_beats_EA_on_a_dynamic_pseudo-boolean_function","262247072_A_method_to_derive_fixed_budget_results_from_expected_optimisation_times","261854807_Analysis_of_diversity_mechanisms_for_optimisation_in_dynamic_environments_with_low_frequencies_of_change","257428701_Theory_of_Randomized_Search_Heuristics","254462422_Fixed_Budget_Computations_A_Different_Perspective_on_Run_Time_Analysis","243784951_Nonparametrics_Statistical_Methods_Based_on_Ranks","221506514_On_the_Analysis_of_the_Immune-Inspired_B-Cell_Algorithm_for_the_Vertex_Cover_Problem","221494264_Perspectives_in_Dynamic_Optimization_Evolutionary_Algorithm","220742745_Theoretical_analysis_of_a_mutation-based_evolutionary_algorithm_for_a_tracking_problem_in_the_lattice","220740446_Theoretical_Analysis_of_Simple_Evolution_Strategies_in_Quickly_Changing_Environments","220693604_Evolutionary_Optimization_in_Dynamic_Environments","220176099_Experimental_study_on_population-based_incremental_learning_algorithms_for_dynamic_optimization_problems","220151992_Zarges_C_Analyzing_different_variants_of_immune_inspired_somatic_contiguous_hypermutations_Theoretical_Computer_Science_4126_517-533","216300794_A_Simple_Sequentially_Rejective_Multiple_Test_Procedure","35224367_Evolutionary_algorithms_and_dynamic_optimization_problems","34512856_Designing_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Dynamic_Environments","28352173_Analysis_of_the_11_EA_for_a_Dynamically_Bitwise_Changing_OneMax","3949587_Analysis_of_the_11_EA_for_a_dynamically_changing_ONEMAX-variant","3810313_11_genetic_algorithm_fitness_dynamics_in_a_changing_environment","2397444_Analysis_of_the_11_EA_for_a_Dynamically_Changing"]}
