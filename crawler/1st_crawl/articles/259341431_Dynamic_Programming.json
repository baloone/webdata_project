{"id":"259341431_Dynamic_Programming","abstract":"Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive\nset of ideas exists that could be called a \"theory.\" What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy\nare concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological,\nhas come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury\nof being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the\nrigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to\nmake effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million\ntimes more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of\nneurophysiology.","authors":["Richard Bellman"],"meta":["July 1966Science 153(3731)","DOI:10.1126/science.153.3731.34","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
