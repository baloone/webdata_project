{"id":"272398775_Realization_of_Nonlinear_MIMO_System_on_Homogeneous_Time_Scales","abstract":"The paper addresses a state space realization problem of a set of higher order delta-differential input-output equations, defined on a homogeneous time scale. The algebraic framework of differential one-forms is applied to formulate necessary and sufficient solvability conditions. This approach applies the total differential operator to analytic system equations to obtain the infinitesimal system description in terms of one-forms. This representation can be converted into polynomial system description by interpreting the polynomial indeterminate as the delta derivative acting on one-forms. The system description in terms of two matrices over skew polynomial ring is then used to derive explicit formulas for the differentials of state coordinates that significantly simplify the calculations. The formulas are found from the left quotients computed by the left Euclidean division algorithm.","authors":["Juri Belikov","Ü.
