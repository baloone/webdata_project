{"id":"241179934_Acoustic_echo_canceller_for_teleconferencing_systems_using_Levinson_algorithm","abstract":"In teleconferencing systems, there are disturbing effects of acoustic echo which hinder the quality of the sound from the loudspeakers. This paper presents an optimization technique to attenuate the acoustic echoes generated due to coupling between the microphone and the loudspeaker. An optimal filter is designed based on a least squares technique. It uses Levinson algorithm to equalize the acoustic channel in an iterative manner by calculating the correlation coefficients needed for updating the iterations, in order to minimize the echo effect. The method calculates the optimal solution directly with less data recorded. The performance was validated and compared with adaptive filtering technique using a real time signal from a conference room.","authors":["Sainath Maddala","Y.
