{"id":"226912869_Quantitative_Continuous_Domains","abstract":"We relate two approaches to Quantitative Domain Theory, the partial metrics of Steve Matthews and the measurements of Keye Martin, by showing that stable partial metrics are in one-to-one correspondence to weakly modular measurements. It is shown that every -algebraic domain admits a partial metric whose associated measurement assigns zero precisely to the set of maximal elements, a condition which features prominently in Martin's work. A partial metric gives rise to a metric in a standard way; we study the conditions under which the resulting space is complete and show that every -algebraic domain admits a partial metric of this kind. We discuss a number of examples and counterexamples to locate the strength of our results more exactly.","authors":["Pawe≈Ç Waszkiewicz"],"meta":["February 2003Applied Categorical Structures 11(1):41-67","DOI:10.1023/A:1023012924892","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265403205_Two_Topologies_Are_Better_Than_One","247516552_Sigma_Series_in_Pure_Mathematics","243768113_A_foundation_for_computation","243069669_Distance_Functions_and_the_Metrization_Problem","227974229_Weighted_Quasi-Metrics","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","227121893_Local_compactness_and_continuous_lattices","225492745_Quantales_and_Continuity_Spaces","223001960_A_characterization_of_partial_metrizability_Domains_are_quantifiable","222445084_A_computational_model_for_metric_spaces","220909733_Quasi_Uniformities_Reconciling_Domains_with_Metric_Spaces"]}
