{"id":"331879132_Reducible_automorphisms_of_the_canonical_Heegaard_splitting_in_a_mapping_torus","abstract":"Let S be an orientable closed surface with genus at least two. From S×I, for a given orientation-reversing homeomorphism f from S×{1} to S×{0}, there is an orientable closed 3-manifold Mf=S×I/f which is called a mapping torus. It is known that Mf admits a canonical Heegaard splitting H1∪ΣH2. By the construction of Namazi [H.Namazi, Topology Appl. 154 (2007), no. 16, 2939-2949], the mapping class group of this Heegaard splitting, denoted by Mod(Σ;H1,H2), contains a reducible mapping class which has infinitely order. So it is interesting to know that for a given element in Mod(Σ;H1,H2), whether it is reducible or not.\nUsing the translation length of f in the curve complex, we prove that if f is the identity map or its translation length is at least 8, then each element of Mod(Σ;H1,H2) is reducible.","authors":["Faze Zhang","Yanqing Zou"],"meta":["March 2019Topology and its Applications 258(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.topol.2019.03.015"],"references":["265458183_The_Classification_of_Heegaard_Splittings_for_Compact_Orient_Able_Surface_S1","265414891_Ranks_of_mapping_tori_via_the_curve_complex","47436773_The_geometry_of_the_disk_complex","2139524_Geometry_Of_The_Complex_Of_Curves_I_Hyperbolicity","2134524_Mapping_class_groups_of_Heegaard_splittings","2104901_Surface_bundles_versus_Heegaard_splittings","320293788_The_unstabilized_canonical_Heegaard_splitting_of_a_mapping_torus","257312422_Geometry_of_the_complex_of_curves_II_Hierarchical_structure","257003705_Unstabilized_self-amalgamation_of_a_Heegaard_splitting","224043463_Automorphisms_of_Surfaces_after_Nielsen_and_Thurston","222563947_Big_Heegaard_distance_implies_finite_mapping_class_group"]}
