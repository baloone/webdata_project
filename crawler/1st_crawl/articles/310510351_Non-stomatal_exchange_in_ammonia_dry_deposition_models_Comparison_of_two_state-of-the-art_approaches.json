{"id":"310510351_Non-stomatal_exchange_in_ammonia_dry_deposition_models_Comparison_of_two_state-of-the-art_approaches","abstract":"The accurate representation of bidirectional ammonia (NH3)\nbiosphere–atmosphere exchange is an important part of modern air quality\nmodels. However, the cuticular (or external leaf surface) pathway, as well as\nother non-stomatal ecosystem surfaces, still pose a major challenge to\ntranslating our knowledge into models. Dynamic mechanistic models including\ncomplex leaf surface chemistry have been able to accurately reproduce\nmeasured bidirectional fluxes in the past, but their computational expense\nand challenging implementation into existing air quality models call for\nsteady-state simplifications. Here we qualitatively compare two\nsemi-empirical state-of-the-art parameterizations of a unidirectional\nnon-stomatal resistance (Rw) model after Massad et al. (2010),\nand a quasi-bidirectional non-stomatal compensation-point (χw) model after Wichink Kruit et al. (2010), with NH3 flux\nmeasurements from five European sites. In addition, we tested the feasibility\nof using backward-looking moving averages of air NH3 concentrations as a\nproxy for prior NH3 uptake and as a driver of an alternative parameterization\nof non-stomatal emission potentials (Γw) for\nbidirectional non-stomatal exchange models. Results indicate that the\nRw-only model has a tendency to underestimate fluxes, while the\nχw model mainly overestimates fluxes, although systematic\nunderestimations can occur under certain conditions, depending on temperature\nand ambient NH3 concentrations at the site. The proposed Γw parameterization revealed a clear functional relationship\nbetween backward-looking moving averages of air NH3 concentrations and\nnon-stomatal emission potentials, but further reduction of uncertainty is\nneeded for it to be useful across different sites. As an interim solution for\nimproving flux predictions, we recommend reducing the minimum allowed\nRw and the temperature response parameter in the unidirectional\nmodel and revisiting the temperature-dependent Γw\nparameterization of the bidirectional model.","authors":["Frederik Schrader","Christian Bruemmer","Chris R.
