{"id":"260945601_Non-Uniqueness_of_the_Homotopy_Class_of_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","abstract":"A bounded curvature path is a continuously differentiable piecewise $C^2$\npath with bounded absolute curvature that connects two points in the tangent\nbundle of a surface. In this work we study the homotopy classes of bounded\ncurvature paths for generic points in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean\nplane. In particular, we characterize the behavior of homotopies of such paths\nin terms of boundedness or unboundedness of their path length. Moreover, for a\ntype of configuration of elements in the tangent bundle we prove the existence\nof a compact planar region in which no bounded curvature path lying on it can\nbe made homotopic to a path outside of the region. In particular, we establish\nthat for such type of configuration, the space of bounded curvature paths is\ndivided into two disjoint components.","authors":["Jos√© Ayala","Hyam Rubinstein"],"meta":["March 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278627686_The_Shortest_path_synthesis_for_non-holonomic_robots_moving_forwards","261029098_The_Classification_of_Homotopy_Classes_of_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","260992557_Shortest_Bounded_Curvature_Paths_with_Self_Intersections","260945828_A_Geometric_Approach_to_Shortest_Bounded_Curvature_Paths","220977800_Constrained_Path_Optimisation_for_Underground_Mine_Layout","264960433_On_Curves_of_Minimal_Length_with_a_Constraint_on_Average_Curvature_and_with_Prescribed_Initial_and_Terminal_Positions_and_Tangents","243768016_On_regular_closed_curves_in_the_plane","238872788_Regular_Curves_on_Riemannian_Manifolds","230578932_On_curves_of_Minimal_lenght_with_a_constraint_on_average_curvature_and_with_prescribed_initial_and_terminal_positions_and_tangents","38347437_On_plane_curves_with_curvature"]}
