{"id":"315920099_An_Effective_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum-Cost_Maximal_Knapsack_Packing_Problem","abstract":"Given a set of items with profits and weights and a knapsack capacity, we study the problem of finding a maximal knapsack packing that minimizes the profit of the selected items. We propose an effective dynamic programming (DP) algorithm which has a pseudo-polynomial time complexity. We demonstrate the equivalence between this problem and the problem of finding a minimal knapsack cover that maximizes the profit of the selected items. In an extensive computational study on a large and diverse set of benchmark instances, we demonstrate that the new DP algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver applied to the two best performing MIP models from the literature.","authors":["Fabio Furini","Ivana Ljubic","Markus Sinnl"],"meta":["March 2017European Journal of Operational Research","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.03.061"],"references":["257196210_Advanced_greedy_algorithms_and_surrogate_constraint_methods_for_linear_and_quadratic_knapsack_and_covering_problems","322907053_Fourier's_Method_of_Linear_Programming_and_its_Dual","293497374_Dynamic_programming","278690128_Knapsack_Problems","278619259_On_the_MAX_k-VERTEX_COVER_problem","268066250_On_the_max_min_vertex_cover_Problem","267022361_The_Lazy_Matroid_Problem","227447203_Dynamic_Programming_and_Strong_Bounds_for_the_0-1_Knapsack_Problem","222880174_A_minimal_algorithm_for_the_multiple-choice_knapsack_problem","222762857_Hardness_of_lazy_packing_and_covering"]}
