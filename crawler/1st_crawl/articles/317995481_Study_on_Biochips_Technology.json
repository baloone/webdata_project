{"id":"317995481_Study_on_Biochips_Technology","abstract":"Biochip, the most exciting future technology is an outcome of the fields of Computer science, Electronics and Biology. It is a new type of bio -security device to accurately track information and who is actually doing it. Biochips promises to bring genomics. Biochips are fast, accurate, miniaturized, and can be expected to become \nas advantageous as a computer chip. The potential applications are vast, both for research and for clinical use with huge market potential. \nBeside s, the efficiency of our approach is manifested by the preliminary succinctly study attempt to define biochip, and discuss \nits manufacturing techniques among others. This paper concludes that biochips have potential applications both for research and clini\ncal use with huge market potentials.","authors":["Blessed Olalekan Oyebola","Odueso Victor Toluwani","Olugbemi S.
