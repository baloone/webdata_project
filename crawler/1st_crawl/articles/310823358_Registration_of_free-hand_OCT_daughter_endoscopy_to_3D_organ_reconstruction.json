{"id":"310823358_Registration_of_free-hand_OCT_daughter_endoscopy_to_3D_organ_reconstruction","abstract":"Despite the trend to pair white light endoscopy with secondary image modalities for in vivo characterization of suspicious lesions, challenges remain to co-register such data. We present an algorithm to co-register two different optical imaging modalities as a mother-daughter endoscopy pair. Using white light cystoscopy (mother) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) (daughter) as an example, we developed the first forward-viewing OCT endoscope that fits in the working channel of flexible cystoscopes and demonstrated our algorithm's performance with optical phantom and clinical imaging data. The ability to register multimodal data opens opportunities for advanced analysis in cancer imaging applications.","authors":["Kristen Lurie","Roland Angst","Eric J.
