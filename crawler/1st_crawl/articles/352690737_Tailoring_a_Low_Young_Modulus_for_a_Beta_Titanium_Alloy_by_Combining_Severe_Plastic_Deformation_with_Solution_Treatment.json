{"id":"352690737_Tailoring_a_Low_Young_Modulus_for_a_Beta_Titanium_Alloy_by_Combining_Severe_Plastic_Deformation_with_Solution_Treatment","abstract":"The present paper analyzed the microstructural characteristics and the mechanical properties of a Ti–Nb–Zr–Fe–O alloy of β-Ti type obtained by combining severe plastic deformation (SPD), for which the total reduction was of εtot = 90%, with two variants of super-transus solution treatment (ST). The objective was to obtain a low Young’s modulus with sufficient high strength in purpose to use the alloy as a biomaterial for orthopedic implants. The microstructure analysis was conducted through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations. The analyzed mechanical properties reveal promising values for yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of about 770 and 1100 MPa, respectively, with a low value of Young’s modulus of about 48–49 GPa. The conclusion is that satisfactory mechanical properties for this type of alloy can be obtained if considering a proper combination of SPD + ST parameters and a suitable content of β-stabilizing alloying elements, especially the Zr/Nb ratio.","authors":["Anna Nocivin","Doina Raducanu","Bogdan Stefan Vasile","Corneliu Trisca-Rusu"],"meta":["June 2021Materials 14(13):3467","DOI:10.3390/ma14133467"],"references":["349044014_materials_Biological_Safety_Evaluation_and_Surface_Modification_of_Biocompatible_Ti-15Zr-4Nb_Alloy","348918687_Ultrafine-Grained_Ti-31Mo-Type_Composites_with_HA_and_Ag_Ta2O5_or_CeO2_Addition_for_Implant_Applications","347841390_Phase_transformations_in_a_heterogeneous_Ti-xNb-7Zr-08O_alloy_prepared_by_a_field-assisted_sintering_technique","344587825_A_Review_on_Bio-functionalization_of_b-Ti_Alloys","349094623_Effects_of_Heat_Treatments_on_the_Structure_and_Mechanical_Properties_of_Ti-25Nb-8Sn_Alloy","347953993_Low_Young's_modulus_of_cold_groove-rolled_b_Ti-Nb-Sn_alloys_for_orthopedic_applications","347953944_Mechanisms_of_tensile_strengthening_and_oxygen_solid_solution_in_single_b-phase_Ti-35_atTaO_alloys","346969444_Influence_of_b-phase_stability_in_elemental_blended_Ti-Mo_and_Ti-Mo-Zr_alloys","344932409_Fracture_behavior_of_novel_biomedical_Ti-based_high_entropy_alloys_under_impact_loading","343784187_Microstructural_evolution_and_mechanical_properties_of_bulk_and_porous_low-cost_Ti-Mo-Fe_alloys_produced_by_powder_metallurgy"]}
