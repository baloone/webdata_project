{"id":"282844196_On_Oblivious_Branching_Programs_with_Bounded_Repetition_that_Cannot_Efficiently_Compute_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","abstract":"In this paper we study complexity of an extension of ordered binary decision\ndiagrams (OBDDs) called $c$-OBDDs on CNFs of bounded (primal graph) treewidth.\nIn particular, we show that for each $k$ there is a class of CNFs of treewidth\n$k \\geq 3$ for which the equivalent $c$-OBDDs are of size\n$\\Omega(n^{k/(8c-4)})$. Moreover, this lower bound holds if $c$-OBDD is\nnon-deterministic and semantic. Our second result uses the above lower bound to\nseparate the above model from sentential decision diagrams (SDDs). In order to\nobtain the lower bound, we use a structural graph parameter called matching\nwidth. Our third result shows that matching width and pathwidth are linearly\nrelated.","authors":["Igor Razgon"],"meta":["October 2017Theory of Computing Systems 61(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9714-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272423134_Width_hierarchy_for_k-OBDD_of_small_width","303787226_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","283043561_Two_types_of_branching_programs_with_bounded_repetition_that_cannot_efficiently_compute_monotone_3-CNFs","268079446_Expander_CNFs_have_Exponential_DNNF_Size","267812027_On_the_Read-Once_Property_of_Branching_Programs_and_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","263619967_No_Small_Nondeterministic_Read-Once_Branching_Programs_for_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","257914138_Extension_of_the_hierarchy_for_k-OBDDs_of_small_width","255971731_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","238198448_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams-Theory_and_Applications","236260582_New_width_parameters_of_graphs","226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","221209528_The_Pathwidth_and_Treewidth_of_Cographs","223364687_Lower_bounds_on_the_pathwidth_of_some_grid-like_graphs","222485510_Hierarchy_theorems_for_kOBDDs_and_kIBDDs"]}
