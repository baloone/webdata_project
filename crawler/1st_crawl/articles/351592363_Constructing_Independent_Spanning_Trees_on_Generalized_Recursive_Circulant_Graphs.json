{"id":"351592363_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Generalized_Recursive_Circulant_Graphs","abstract":"The generalized recursive circulant networking can be widely used in the design and implementation of interconnection networks. It consists of a series of processors, each is connected through bidirectional, point-to-point communication channels to different neighbors. In this work, we apply the shortest path routing concept to build independent spanning trees on the generalized recursive circulant graphs. The proposed strategy loosen the restricted conditions in previous research and extended the result to a more general vertex setting by design the specific algorithm to deal with the constraint issue.","authors":["Dun-Wei Cheng","Kai-Hsun Yao","Sun-Yuan Hsieh"],"meta":["May 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3080315"],"references":["343496425_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Transposition_Networks","341840878_Top-Down_Construction_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Alternating_Group_Networks","338179454_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Pancake_Networks","333699968_Amortized_efficiency_of_constructing_multiple_independent_spanning_trees_on_bubble-sort_networks","266212788_The_isomorphism_problem_for_circulant_graphs_via_Schur_ring_theory","312628479_Circulants_and_their_connectivities","311852252_Constructing_completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","257252350_Distributed_Loop_Computer-Networks_A_Survey","242790259_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_GcdmdGcdmd_with_d2d2","242608512_Introduction_to_Parallel_Algorithms_and_Architectures_Arrays_Trees_Hypercubes"]}
