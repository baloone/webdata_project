{"id":"304272693_Schools'_readiness_and_capacity_to_improve_matter","abstract":"The literature reveals that up to half of all evidence-based programmes introduced in schools will fail to reach their expected outcomes due to poor implementation. Addressing the reasons why school change works in some schools and not in others is therefore important. It is argued in this article that if a school’s readiness and capacity for improvement is identified, it may predict the outcome of a future change initiative when adequate support is provided. Drawing on the Burke-Litwin model of organisational change, supported by theory and previous research from school improvement and prevention practice, we aim to present an overview of factors to take into consideration before new change initiatives are implemented in school settings. These factors exist on the external, school or individual level and have either a transformational or transactional nature. Yet factors at all of these levels may influence a school’s capacity and readiness to improve.","authors":["Constance Oterkiil","Sigrun K.
