{"id":"325529769_Towards_a_Binary_Object_Notation_for_RDF","abstract":"The recent JSON-LD standard, that specifies an object notation for RDF, has been adopted by a number of data providers on the Web. In this paper, we present a novel usage of JSON-LD, as a compact format to exchange and query RDF data in constrained environments, in the context of the Web of Things. A typical exchange between Web of Things agents involves small pieces of semantically described data (RDF data sets of less than hundred triples). In this context, we show how JSON-LD, serialized in binary JSON formats like EXI4JSON and CBOR, outperforms the state-of-the-art. Our experiments were performed on data sets provided by the literature, as well as a production data set exported from Siemens Desigo CC. We also provide a formalism for JSON-LD and show how it offers a lightweight alternative to SPARQL via JSON-LD framing.","authors":["Victor Charpenay","Sebastian KÃ¤bisch","Harald Kosch"],"meta":["June 2018Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-93417-4_7","In book: The Semantic Web (pp.97-111)"],"references":["278705249_Efficient_RDF_Interchange_ERI_Format_for_RDF_Data_Streams","265574687_RDF_Provisioning_for_the_Internet_of_Things","260439504_The_Wiselib_TupleStore_A_Modular_RDF_Database_for_the_Internet_of_Things","257800125_An_Overview_on_Execution_Strategies_for_Linked_Data_Queries","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","221466943_Compact_Representation_of_Large_RDF_Data_Sets_for_Publishing_and_Exchange","51892510_Compressed_k2-Triples_for_Full-In-Memory_RDF_Engines","2407452_Logical_Foundations_of_Object-Oriented_and_Frame-Based_Languages_Journal_of_the_ACM_424_741-843","1959441_Semantics_and_complexity_of_SPARQL","320899445_mu_m_RDF_Store_Towards_Extending_the_Semantic_Web_to_Embedded_Devices","308569203_Linked_Data_in_Low-Resource_Platforms_A_Mapping_for_Constrained_Application_Protocol","304406830_SPARQL_for_Networks_of_Embedded_Systems","300883800_Standardized_and_Efficient_RDF_Encoding_for_Constrained_Embedded_Networks","280113745_Linked_Data_Platform_10","265140939_Querying_Datasets_on_the_Web_with_High_Availability","259671337_JSON-LD_10_-_A_JSON-based_Serialization_for_Linked_Data","224208047_Embedded_Web_Services","220574479_Foundations_of_Semantic_Web_Databases","220030753_SPITFIRE_toward_a_semantic_web_of_things"]}
