{"id":"260268966_An_octonionic_formulation_of_the_M-theory_algebra","abstract":"We give an octonionic formulation of the N = 1 supersymmetry algebra in D =\n11, including all brane charges. We write this in terms of a novel outer\nproduct, which takes a pair of elements of the division algebra A and returns a\nreal linear operator on A. More generally, with this product comes the power to\nrewrite any linear operation on R^n (n = 1,2,4,8) in terms of multiplication in\nthe n-dimensional division algebra A. Finally, we consider the reinterpretation\nof the D = 11 supersymmetry algebra as an octonionic algebra in D = 4 and the\ntruncation to division subalgebras.","authors":["Alexandros Anastasiou","Leron Borsten","M.
