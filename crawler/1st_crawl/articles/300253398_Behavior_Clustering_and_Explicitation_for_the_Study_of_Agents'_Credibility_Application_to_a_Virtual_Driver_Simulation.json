{"id":"300253398_Behavior_Clustering_and_Explicitation_for_the_Study_of_Agents'_Credibility_Application_to_a_Virtual_Driver_Simulation","abstract":"The aim of this article is to provide a method for evaluating the credibility of agents’ behaviors in immersive multi-agent simulations. It is based on a quantitative data collection from both humans and agents simulation logs during an experiment. These data allow us to semi-automatically extract behavior clusters. In order to obtain explicit information about the behaviors, we analyze questionnaires filled by the users and annotations filled by a second set of participants. It enables to draw user categories related to their behavior in the context of the simulation or of their real life habits. We then study the similarities between behavior clusters, user categories, and participants’ annotations. Afterwards, we evaluate the agents’ credibility and make their behaviors explicit by comparing human behaviors to agent ones according to user categories and annotations. Our method is applied to the study of virtual driver simulation through an immersive driving simulator.","authors":["Kevin Darty","Julien Saunier","Nicolas Sabouret"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25210-0_6","Conference: International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["262215257_SimAnalyzer_automated_description_of_groups_dynamics_in_agent-based_simulations","259527911_On_the_Nature_and_Evaluation_of_Fidelity_in_Virtual_Environments","245583342_Behavioral_Road_Traffic_Simulation_with_ARCHISM","236022618_Immersion_realisme_et_presence_dans_la_conception_et_l'evaluation_des_environnements_virtuels","235709979_Toward_Accurate_Dynamic_Time_Warping_in_Linear_Time_and_Space","233096619_A_Dendrite_Method_for_Cluster_Analysis","232003352_Does_a_chimpanzee_have_a_theory_of_mind","221606526_Learning_Interface_Agents","220571483_Toward_accurate_dynamic_time_warping_in_linear_time_and_space","220090259_A_Cross-Media_Presence_Questionnaire_The_ITC-Sense_of_Presence_Inventory","41026588_Errors_and_Violations_on_the_Roads_a_Real_Distinction","2532744_X-means_Extending_K-means_with_Efficient_Estimation_of_the_Number_of_Clusters","2465419_MANTA_New_Experimental_Results_on_the_Emergence_of_Artificial_Ant_Societies","270819378_The_self-organizing_map","268594181_Behavioral_Simulation_Towards_High-Density_Network_Traffic_Studies","258847270_Conditioned_Reflexes","243769591_A_Study_Of_The_Comparability_Of_External_Criteria_For_Hierarchical_Cluster-Analysis","243541346_Training_research_and_practice","233842851_An_approach_to_debug_interactions_in_multi-agent_system_software_tests","221654270_Using_Dynamic_Time_Warping_to_Find_Patterns_in_Time_Series","221518870_The_Persona_Effect_Affective_Impact_of_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents","220778887_K-Means_The_Advantages_of_Careful_Seeding","220090228_The_Presence_of_Field_Geologists_in_Mars-Like_Terrain","220090047_The_Experience_of_a_Sense_of_Presence_in_Intercultural_and_International_Encounters","200086112_A_Technique_for_Measurement_of_Attitudes","37415426_L'enquete_par_questionnaire_manuel_a_l'usage_du_praticien","34843023_The_development_of_objective_criteria_for_evaluating_clustering_methods","24056046_Comparing_Partitions","2463817_Measuring_Presence_in_Virtual_Environments_A_Presence_Questionnaire"]}
