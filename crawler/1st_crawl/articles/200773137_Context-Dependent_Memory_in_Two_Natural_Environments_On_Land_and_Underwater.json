{"id":"200773137_Context-Dependent_Memory_in_Two_Natural_Environments_On_Land_and_Underwater","abstract":"In a free recall experiment, divers learnt lists of words in two natural environments: on dry land and underwater, and recalled the words in either the environment of original learning, or in the alternative environment. Lists learnt underwater were best recalled underwater, and vice versa. A subsequent experiment shows that the disruption of moving from one environment to the other was unlikely to be responsible for context-dependent memory.","authors":["Duncan R.
