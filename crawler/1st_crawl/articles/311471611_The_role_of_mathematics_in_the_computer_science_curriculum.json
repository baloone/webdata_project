{"id":"311471611_The_role_of_mathematics_in_the_computer_science_curriculum","abstract":"There has been much debate in the past few years about the appropriate mathematics requirements for an undergraduate computer science major. The discussion has focused primarily on two issues: (1) the underlying mathematical content of computer science courses and (2) the content of mathematics courses which would serve as appropriate cognate requirements for computer science major programs. While this discussion has been helpful, it has been too narrowly focused--it has not started from an understanding of the relationship between the disciplines of mathematics and computer science, but rather has sought to identify mathematical prerequisites that computer science majors need in order to take existing computer science courses. This paper is a small step in seeking to apply an understanding of the relationship between the disciplines of mathematics and computer science to the undergraduate computer science curriculum.","authors":["James Bradley"],"meta":["February 1988ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 20(1):100-103","DOI:10.1145/52965.52990"],"references":["234829588_Programming_pearls_a_sample_of_brilliance","221536798_Mathematics_support_for_computing_degrees_A_small_college_perspective","220427542_Computer_Science_as_Empirical_Inquiry_Symbols_and_Search","220425196_A_Mathematically_Focused_Curriculum_for_Computer_Science","220421729_A_Model_Curriculum_for_a_Liberal_Arts_Degree_in_Computer_Science","220421649_The_First_Course_in_Computer_Science_Needs_a_Mathematics_Corequisite","213878118_Curriculum_'78_recommendations_for_the_undergraduate_program_in_computer_science---_a_report_of_the_ACM_curriculum_committee_on_computer_science"]}
