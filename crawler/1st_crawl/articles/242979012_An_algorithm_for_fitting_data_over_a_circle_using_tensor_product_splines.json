{"id":"242979012_An_algorithm_for_fitting_data_over_a_circle_using_tensor_product_splines","abstract":"An algorithm is described for surface fitting over a circle by using tensor product splines which satisfy certain boundary conditions. This algorithm is an extension of an existing one for fitting data over a rectangle. The knots of the splines are chosen automatically but a single parameter must be specified to control the tradeoff between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit. The algorithm can easily be generalized for fitting data over any domain that can be described in polar coordinates. Constraints at the boundaries of this approximation domain can be imposed.","authors":["Paul Dierckx"],"meta":["June 1986Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 15(2):161-173","DOI:10.1016/0377-0427(86)90024-5"],"references":["266695183_The_incorporation_of_boundary_conditions_in_spline_approximation_problems","256209311_On_Calculating_with_B-Splines","247559932_Smoothing_by_spline_functions_II_Numer","226157456_Smoothing_by_Spline_Functions","225808753_Algorithms_for_Smoothing_Data_on_the_Sphere_with_Tensor_Product_Splines","223802564_Algorithms_for_smoothing_data_with_periodic_and_parametric_splines","31378539_The_Numerical_Evaluation_of_B-Splines","31369657_Least_Squares_Computations_by_Givens_Transformations_Without_Square_Roots","31172866_An_Algorithm_for_Surface-Fitting_with_Spline_Functions"]}
