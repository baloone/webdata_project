{"id":"221630852_Involving_Business_Users_in_Formal_Modeling_Using_Natural_Language_Pattern_Sentences","abstract":"With knowledge representation based technologies reaching the enterprise, involving business users in modeling is more important\nthan ever. When primary processes and business decisions are driven by models, business knowledge needs to be captured and\nonly business users can establish whether the models created are correct.\n\nA natural language based representation of models can help business users get involved in the modeling process. We have used\na representation based on natural language pattern sentences to improve business user participation in our business modeling\nprojects. Based on the lessons learned, user interfaces have been developed that use this representation for both communicating\nand editing formal models.","authors":["Jeroen Van Grondelle","Ronald Heller","Emiel van Haandel","Tim Verburg"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-16438-5_3","SourceDBLP","Conference: Knowledge Engineering and Management by the Masses - 17th International Conference, EKAW 2010At: Lisbon, Portugal"],"references":["225101929_CLOnE_Controlled_Language_for_Ontology_Editing","221466581_RoundTrip_Ontology_Authoring","221218548_Verbalizing_OWL_in_Attempto_Controlled_English","220854134_A_Knowledge_Infrastructure_for_the_Dutch_Immigration_Office"]}
