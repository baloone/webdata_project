{"id":"329905163_A_Size-Dependent_Functionally_Graded_Higher_Order_Plate_Analysis_Based_on_Modified_Couple_Stress_Theory_and_Moving_Kriging_Meshfree_Method","abstract":"A size-dependent computational approach for bending, free vibration and buckling analyses of isotropic and sandwich functionally graded (FG) microplates is in this study presented. We consider both shear deformation and small scale effects through the generalized higher order shear deformation theory and modified couple stress theory (MCST). The present model only retains a single material length scale parameter for capturing properly size effects. A rule of mixture is used to model material properties varying through the thickness of plates. The principle of virtual work is used to derive the discrete system equations which are approximated by moving Kriging interpolation (MKI) meshfree method. Numerical examples consider the inclusions of geometrical parameters, volume fraction, boundary conditions and material length scale parameter. Reliability and effectiveness of the present method are confirmed through numerical results.","authors":["Dung Tran Trung","Chien thai Hoang","H.
