{"id":"340097917_A_study_of_scientific_publications_on_the_greater_cane_rat_Thryonomys_swinderianus_Temminck_1827","abstract":"Background\nThe greater cane rat (GCR), reputed to be African's second largest rodent, is a precocial hystricomorph with an uncommon phenotype and life history. Scientific and socio‐economic interests in the GCR have led to heightened research efforts targeted towards a better understanding of its biology and exploration of its economic and translational usefulness.\n\nMethods\nRecords of all online scientific publications on the GCR from Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, science.gov, Ebscohost and Worldwide science, with the exception of research theses, proceedings, unpublished projects and abstracts, were collated and analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\nResults\nA total of 146 published scholarly articles spanning about six decades were retrieved, with 98% of the GCR publications originating from African countries. Nigeria boasts the highest number of publications (58.22%) followed by Ghana (21.23%) and South Africa (5.48%) while Senegal contributed the least (0.69%). Publications were sorted into ten field categories. The field with the highest number of articles (41.78%) was animal breeding and management recording, closely followed by anatomy (37.67%). Lesser contributions were made by parasitology (5.48%), biochemistry/hematology (4.8%), pharmacology/toxicology (4.11%), pathology (2.06%), and surgery/anesthesia and physiology (1.37% apiece). The fields with fewest contributions were microbiology and developmental biology (0.69% each).\n\nConclusion\nThis study chronicles the spectrum of knowledge available on the GCR, highlighting the knowledge gap that still exists in various fields in order to provide advocacy for new frontiers in research efforts on this rodent. We suggest the need for a clearly defined and well integrated national/regional policy aimed at establishing Africa's foremost micro‐livestock rodent, the greater cane rat, on the world's scientific radar.","authors":["Oluwaseun Mustapha","Ebunoluwa Elizabeth Teriba","Oluwaseun Samuel Ezekiel","Ayo Olude"],"meta":["March 2020Animal Models and Experimental Medicine 3(1)","DOI:10.1002/ame2.12103","Project: Greater Cane Rat/Grasscutter Neuroanatomy"],"references":["333000705_Anatomical_Studies_on_the_Spinal_Cord_of_the_Greater_Cane_Rat_Thryonomys_Swinderianus_Temminck_II_Histomorphology_and_Spinal_Tracings","329041160_Regional_skin_histomorphology_in_adult_greater_cane_rats_Thryonomys_swinderianus_A_pilot_study","328841246_REGIONAL_DERMAL_HISTOMORPHOLOGY_IN_THE_ADULT_GREATER_CANE_RAT_Thryonomys_swinderianus_A_PILOT_STUDY","328572356_Examination_of_the_Lung_and_Liver_for_Pathological_Changes_in_Hunted_Grasscutters_Thryonomis_swinderianus_in_Southwest_Nigeria","322488127_Anatomical_Studies_on_the_Spinal_Cord_of_the_Greater_Cane_Rat_Thryonomys_Swinderianus_Temminck_II_Histomorphology_and_Spinal_Tracings","322488125_Anatomical_Studies_on_the_Spinal_Cord_of_the_of_the_Greater_Cane_Rat_Thryonomys_swinderianus_Temminck_I_Gross_Morphometry","322378484_Brain_Size_of_the_African_Grasscutter_Thryonomys_Swinderianus_Temminck_1827_at_Defined_Postnatal_Periods","319669071_Cranio-facial_and_ocular_morphometrics_of_the_male_greater_cane_rat_Thryonomys_swinderianus","334527858_Developmental_horizons_in_the_pre-natal_development_of_the_Greater_cane_rat_Thryonomys_swinderianus","333001132_Anatomical_Studies_on_the_Spinal_Cord_of_the_Greater_Cane_Rat_Thryonomys_swinderianus_Temminck_I_Gross_Morphometry"]}
