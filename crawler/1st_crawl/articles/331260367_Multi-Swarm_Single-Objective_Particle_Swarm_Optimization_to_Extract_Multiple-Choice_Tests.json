{"id":"331260367_Multi-Swarm_Single-Objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_to_Extract_Multiple-Choice_Tests","abstract":"This paper proposes the use of multi-swarm method in particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to generate multiple-choice tests based on assumed objective levels of difficulty. The method extracts an abundance of tests at the same time with the same levels of difficulty and approximates the difficulty-level requirement given by the users. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate many tests from question banks satisfying predefined levels of difficulty. Additionally, the proposed method is also shown to be effective in terms of many criteria when compared with other methods such as manually extracted tests, random methods and PSO-based methods in terms of execution time, standard deviation, the number of particles per swarm and the number of swarms.","authors":["Trâm Nguyễn","Toan Bui","Bay Vo"],"meta":["February 2019Vietnam Journal of Computer Science 6(2):1-15","DOI:10.1142/S219688881950009X"],"references":["312519986_Particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_an_overview","306304578_Constrained_Optimization_Problems_Solving_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms_A_Review","304578122_Hierarchical_multi-swarm_cooperative_teaching-learning-based_optimization_for_global_optimization","282773612_A_Comprehensive_Survey_on_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_and_Its_Applications","277014256_Multi-Objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_MOPSO_based_on_Pareto_Dominance_Approach","268380077_GPU-Based_Parallel_Multi-objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","329252980_Application_of_particle_swarm_optimization_to_create_multiple-choice_tests","322090615_A_Comparative_Study_of_Improved_GA_and_PSO_in_Solving_Multiple_Traveling_Salesmen_Problem","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","285909701_A_comparative_study_of_genetic_algorithm_improved-repulsive_particle_swarm_optimization_simulated_annealing"]}
