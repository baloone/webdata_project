{"id":"246650409_Large_Losses_of_Total_Ozone_in_Antarctica_Reveal_Seasonal_ClOxNOx_Interaction","abstract":"Recent attempts1,2 to consolidate assessments of the effect\nof human activities on stratospheric ozone (O3) using\none-dimensional models for 30Â° N have suggested that perturbations\nof total O3 will remain small for at least the next decade.\nResults from such models are often accepted by default as global\nestimates3. The inadequacy of this approach is here made\nevident by observations that the spring values of total O3 in\nAntarctica have now fallen considerably. The circulation in the lower\nstratosphere is apparently unchanged, and possible chemical causes must\nbe considered. We suggest that the very low temperatures which prevail\nfrom midwinter until several weeks after the spring equinox make the\nAntarctic stratosphere uniquely sensitive to growth of inorganic\nchlorine, ClX, primarily by the effect of this growth on the\nNO2/NO ratio. This, with the height distribution of UV\nirradiation peculiar to the polar stratosphere, could account for the\nO3 losses observed.","authors":["J.C. Farman","B.G. Gardiner","J.D.
