{"id":"262162554_An_Application_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_to_Statistical_Physics_and_Circuit_Layout_Design","abstract":"We study the problem of finding ground states of spin glasses with exterior magnetic field, and the problem of minimizing the number of vias (holes on a printed circuit board, or contacts on a chip) subject to pin preassignments and layer preferences. The former problem comes up in solid-state physics, and the latter in very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) circuit design and in printed circuit board design. Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes.","authors":["Francisco Barahona","Martin Grötschel","Michael Jünger","Gerhard Reinelt"],"meta":["May 1988Operations Research 36(3):493-513","DOI:10.1287/opre.36.3.493"],"references":["253827171_Finding_ground_states_in_random-field_Ising_ferromagnets","246157468_Facets_of_the_Bipartite_Subgraph_Polytope","243775883_A_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm_for_the_Linear_Ordering_Problem","260784230_Investigation_of_the_validity_of_the_slow-cooling_iterative_mean-field_method_for_the_study_of_ground-state_properties_of_spin-glasses","256215505_Spin_glasses","251681923_Testing_the_Odd_Bicycle_Wheel_Inequalities_for_the_Bipartite_Subgraph_Polytope","243779178_Solving_Large-Scale_Zero-One_Linear_Programming_Problems","235591383_Magnetic_correlations_in_two-dimensional_spin-glasses","235564299_Static_and_dynamic_magnetic_response_of_spin-glass_models_with_short-range_interactions","227445032_Solving_Large-Scale_Symmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problems_to_Optimality"]}
