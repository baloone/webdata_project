{"id":"322546550_Reducing_the_Cost_of_Exploring_Neighborhood_Areas_in_Dynamic_Local_Search_for_SAT","abstract":"Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms are of great importance to many fields of Computer\nSciences and Artificial Intelligence. This is due to their efficient performance when applied for\nsolving randomly generated satisfiability problems (SAT). Our focus in the current work is on one of\nthe SLS dynamic weighting approaches known as multi-level weight distribution (mulLWD). We\nexperimentally investigated the performance and the weight behaviors of mulLWD. Based on our\nexperiments, we observed that the 2nd level weights movements could lead to poor performance of\nmulLWD, especially when applied for solving large and harder SAT problems. Therefore, we\ndeveloped a new heuristic that could reduce the cost of the 2nd level neighborhood exploitation\nknown as partial multi-level weight distribution mulLWD+. Experimental results indicate that\nmulLWD+ heuristic has significantly better performance than mulLWD in a wide range of SAT\nproblems.","authors":["Abdelraouf Ishtaiwi","Ghassan Issa","Wael Hadi"],"meta":["December 2017Current Journal of Applied Science and Technology 25(2):1-9","DOI:10.9734/CJAST/2017/38361","Project: Satisfiability"],"references":[]}
