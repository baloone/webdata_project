{"id":"299125666_Analytic_and_numerical_solution_for_duffing_equations","abstract":"Daftardar Gejji and Hossein Jafari have proposed a new iterative method for solving many of the linear and nonlinear equations namely (DJM). This method proved already the effectiveness in solved many of the ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations and integral equations. The main aim from this paper is to propose the Daftardar-Jafari method (DJM) to solve the Duffing equations and to find the exact solution and numerical solutions. The proposed (DJM) is very effective and reliable, and the solution is obtained in the series form with easily computed components. The software used for the calculations in this study was MATHEMATICAÂ® 9.0.","authors":["Majeed AL-Jawary","Sayl Gani Abd- Al-Razaq"],"meta":["March 2016International Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences 5(2):115","DOI:10.14419/ijbas.v5i2.5838"],"references":["326301353_The_variational_iteration_method_for_calculating_carbon_dioxide_absorbed_into_phenyl_glycidyl_ether","283278713_A_Comparison_between_New_Iterative_Solutions_of_Non-linear_Oscillator_Equation","280778241_Approximate_solution_for_nonlinear_Duffing_oscillator_with_damping_effect_using_the_modified_differential_transform_method","262196411_A_new_approach_for_solving_Duffing_equations_involving_both_integral_and_non-integral_forcing_terms","258397066_Numerical_Solution_of_Duffing_Equation_by_Using_an_Improved_Taylor_Matrix_Method","245539007_Convergence_of_the_New_Iterative_Method","238597561_ON_THE_APPLICATION_OF_ADOMIAN_DECOMPOSITION_METHOD_AND_OSCILLATION_EQUATIONS","273328168_Steady-state_concentrations_of_carbon_dioxide_absorbed_into_phenyl_glycidyl_ether_solutions_by_the_Adomian_decomposition_method","258303918_An_effective_approach_for_approximate_analytical_solutions_of_the_damped_Duffing_equation","235657024_An_efficient_new_iterative_method_for_oscillator_differential_equation"]}
