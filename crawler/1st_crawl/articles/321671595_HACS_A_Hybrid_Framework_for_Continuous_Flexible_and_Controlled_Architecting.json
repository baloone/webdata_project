{"id":"321671595_HACS_A_Hybrid_Framework_for_Continuous_Flexible_and_Controlled_Architecting","abstract":"Systems like e-voting, e-banking or e-health must offer flexibility to continuously meet technical\nand legal changing requirements and must at the same time guarantee robustness to respect\ntheir security and sensitivity. Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Service\nOriented Software Engineering (SOSE) with their modular design represent the most suitable\nparadigms for those systems. They have strong complementary advantages, despite their\nsimilarities, their heterogeneity still hinders systems to benefit from both of them. In this paper,\nwe propose a hybrid framework HACS (Hybrid Approach between Component and Service).\nHACS proposes to define sensitive systems as a hybrid architecture where the critical parts\nare controlled according to CBSE coupled to the flexibility and dynamism of SOSE. To address\nheterogeneity and make possible the substitution between hybrid components, HACS uses\na common syntax with semantic annotations based on SAWSDL related to two ontologies;\nHACS ontology and domain ontology. We illustrate HACS all along the paper through\nan e-voting case study.","authors":["Khadidja Bentlemsan","Djamal Bennouar","Dalila Tamzalit","Khaled Walid Hidouci"],"meta":["December 2017Acta Informatica Pragensia 6(2):124–137","DOI:10.18267/j.aip.105","Project: Conciliation de l'approche à composants et l'approche à services"],"references":["241573216_YET_ANOTHER_SEMANTIC_ANNOTATION_FOR_WSDL","240918753_Web_Services_Description_Language_WSDL_Version_20_Part_1_Core_Language","234082610_A_Service-Oriented_Architecture_for_Robust_e-Voting","285168966_Electronic_Voting_Systems_-_From_Theory_to_Implementation","262164428_Mosaic_a_secure_and_practical_remote_voting_system","260520056_QoS-Aware_Dynamic_Composition_of_Web_Services_Using_Numerical_Temporal_Planning","243774462_Web_Services_Description_Language_WSDL_Version_2","224114705_An_architecture_for_e-voting_systems_based_on_dependable_web_services","221327336_A_Practical_Secret_Voting_Scheme_for_Large_Scale_Elections","221260516_Helios_Web-based_Open-Audit_Voting","221159043_Analysis_of_a_Distributed_e-Voting_System_Architecture_against_Quality_of_Service_Requirements","4274461_Component-Based_and_Service-Oriented_Software_Engineering_Key_Concepts_and_Principles","220377941_A_new_approach_for_component's_port_modeling_in_software_architecture","200827695_Service-Oriented_Architecture_Concepts_Technology_and_Design","3419969_SAWSDL_semantic_annotations_for_WSDL_and_XML_schema"]}
