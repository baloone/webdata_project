To address the problems that NCQI cannot handle images with inconsistent horizontal and vertical position sizes and multi-channel image processing, an improved color digital image quantum representation (INCQI) model based on NCQI is proposed in this paper. The INCQI model can process color images and facilitate multi-channel quantum image transformations and transparency information processing of images using auxiliary quantum bits. In addition, the quantum image control circuit was designed based on INCQI. And quantum image preparation experiments were conducted on IBM Quantum Experience (IBMQ) to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of INCQI quantum image preparation. The prepared image information was obtained by quantum measurement in the experiment, and the visualization of quantum information was successfully realized. The research in this paper has some reference value for the research related to QIP.","authors":["Jie Su","Xuchao Guo","Chengqi Liu","Shuhan Lu"],"meta":["July 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-93471-7"],"references":["347592280_A_New_Trend_of_Quantum_Image_Representations","338000573_Double_quantum_color_images_encryption_scheme_based_on_DQRCI","337634048_Quantum_Representation_of_Indexed_Images_and_its_Applications","336241558_Order-encoded_quantum_image_model_and_parallel_histogram_specification","333127113_An_improved_flexible_representation_of_quantum_images","328561865_Multi-image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_3D_Arnold_transform_and_scaled_Zhongtang_chaotic_system","332769902_Quantum_Block_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Arnold_Transform_and_Sine_Chaotification_Model","330318341_QRCI_A_new_quantum_representation_model_of_color_digital_images","327850482_A_Quantum_Image_Representation_Based_on_Bitplanes","327049207_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Image_Processing"]}
