{"id":"292843283_Biomedical_engineering_A_historical_perspective","abstract":"This chapter provides an overview of technology's role in shaping modern health care system, highlights the basic roles biomedical engineers play, and presents a view of the professional status of this dynamic field. The discipline of biomedical engineering has emerged as an integrating medium for two dynamic professions, medicine and engineering, and has assisted in the struggle against illness and disease by providing tools such as biosensors, biomaterials, image processing, and artificial intelligence that can be utilized for research, diagnosis, and treatment by health care professionals. The chapter helps identify the major role that advances in medical technology have played in the establishment of the modern health care system. It defines the term biomedical engineering and the roles biomedical engineers play in the health care delivery system. It also explains why biomedical engineers are professionals. It finally concludes biomedical engineers serve as relatively new members of the health care delivery team that seeks new solutions for the difficult problems confronting modern society.","authors":["Joseph Bronzino"],"meta":["December 2005","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-238662-6.50003-3","In book: Introduction to Biomedical Engineering (pp.1-29)"],"references":[]}
