{"id":"321125221_Improved_Thresholding_Method_for_Enhancing_Jawi_Binarization_Performance","abstract":"Most local adaptive image binarization techniques have been inspired by Niblack's method and thus use local thresholding. Niblack's and the NICK methods that is based on it introduce a parameter k to determine the object boundaries in a given window, but one of the deﬁciencies of local thresholding is that the k value is constant. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculating k values for the NICK binarization method: we set the k value based on the standard deviation of the image. For our experiments, we used the DIBCO 2013 dataset and a privately held ancient Jawi manuscript dataset. The results were evaluated using the F-measure, pseudo F-measure, peak signal-to-noise ratio, misclassication penalty metrics (MPM), distance reciprocal distortion (DRD), and overall rank score. The proposed method achieved result of 91.09% for the DIBCO dataset and 87.07% for the Jawi dataset, which were higher than those with earlier methods that used ﬁxed k values ranging from - 0.2 to - 0.1. These results indicate that the k values produced by the proposed method can adapt to the state of the manuscript and that using them for NICK thresholding can increase binarization performance.","authors":["Khairun Saddami","Khairul Munadi","Sayed Muchallil","Fitri Arnia"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICDAR.2017.183","Conference: The 14th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) 2017At: Kyoto, Japan","Project: Jawi Character Recognition"],"references":["221389513_H-DIBCO_2010_-_Handwritten_Document_Image_Binarization_Competition","221253803_Comparison_of_Niblack_inspired_Binarization_Methods_for_Ancient_Documents","220860516_ICDAR_2009_Document_Image_Binarization_Contest_DIBCO_2009","220827321_Adaptive_Thresholding_Methods_for_Documents_Image_Binarization","20925175_Contrast_in_complex_images","3710586_Adaptive_Document_Binarization","308860033_Noise_characterization_in_ancient_document_images_based_on_DCT_coefficient_distribution","305437251_An_Introduction_to_Digital_Image_Processing","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","269268157_Improvement_of_binarization_performance_by_applying_DCT_as_pre-processing_procedure","256822721_A_new_binarization_method_for_non-uniform_illuminated_document_images","225346142_Extraction_and_Recognition_of_Artificial_Text_in_Multimedia_Documents","222880315_Minimum_error_threshold","222116549_Automatic_thresholding_of_gray-level_pictures_using_two-dimensional_entropy","220305658_Contrast_adaptive_binarization_of_low_quality_document_images"]}
