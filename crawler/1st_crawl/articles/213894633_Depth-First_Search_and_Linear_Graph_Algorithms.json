{"id":"213894633_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms","abstract":"The value of depth-first search or “backtracking” as a technique for solving problems is illustrated by two examples. An improved version of an algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph and at algorithm for finding the biconnected components of an undirect graph are presented. The space and time requirements of both algorithms are bounded by $k_1 V + k_2 E + k_3 $ for some constants $k_1 ,k_2 $, and $k_3 $, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges of the graph being examined.","authors":["Robert Endre Tarjan"],"meta":["January 1972SIAM Journal on Computing 1(2):146-160","DOI:10.1137/0201010"],"references":["220430549_Backtrack_Programming","220422902_An_Algorithm_for_the_Blocks_and_Cutnodes_of_a_Graph","220422057_Scientific_Applications_An_algorithm_for_identifying_the_ergodic_subchains_and_transient_states_of_a_stochastic_matrix","220114179_A_V_Algorithm_for_Determining_Isomorphism_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
