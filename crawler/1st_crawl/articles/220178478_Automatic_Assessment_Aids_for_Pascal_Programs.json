{"id":"220178478_Automatic_Assessment_Aids_for_Pascal_Programs","abstract":"Practical programming courses in the Pascal Language inevitably include the need to assess programs submitted by the students. Part of this assessment usually involves awarding marks for the style of the program listing. The philosophy behind a program designed to asses the style of Pascal programs and award marks automatically is presented. The results obtained on actual student courses are discussed, and some extensions which could lead to further assessment aids are suggested.","authors":["Michael J Rees"],"meta":["October 1982ACM SIGPLAN Notices 17(10):33-42","DOI:10.1145/948086.948088","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234809583_Some_Pascal_style_guidelines","220281403_On_Publication_Pascal"]}
