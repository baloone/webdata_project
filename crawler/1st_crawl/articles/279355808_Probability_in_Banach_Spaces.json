{"id":"279355808_Probability_in_Banach_Spaces","abstract":"This chapter is devoted to Rademacher averages Σ iε ix i with vector valued coefficients as a natural analog of the Gaussian averages Σ ig ix i. The properties we examine are entirely similar to those investigated in the Gaussian case. In this way, we will see how isoperimetric methods can be used to yield strong integrability properties of convergent Rademacher series and chaos. This is studied in Sections 4.3 and 4.4. Some comparison results are also available in the form, for example, of a version of Sudakov’s minoration presented in Section 4.5. However, we start in the first two sections with some basic facts about Rademacher averages with real coefficients as well as with the so-called contraction principle, a most valuable tool in Probability in Banach spaces.","authors":["Michel Ledoux","Michel Talagrand"],"meta":["January 1991","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-20212-4_6","In book: Probability in Banach Spaces (pp.89-121)"],"references":["2256697_On_the_Best_Constants_in_the_Khintchine_Inequality","303333508_The_distribution_of_rademacher_sums","279341620_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Inequalities","268615016_Les_inegalites_de_Khintchine-Kahane_d'apres_C_Borell","266216856_Additive_functionals_on_spaces_with_non-absolutely-continuous_norm","265373878_Sums_of_independent_Banach_space_valued_random_variables","251249825_Rademacher_series_in_symmetric_spaces","247839776_The_Distribution_of_Rademacher_Sums","245841576_De_nouvelles_caract_erisations_des_ensembles_de_Sidon","243623120_Some_Random_Series_of_Functions","243078010_Integrability_of_Infinite_Sums_of_Independent_Vector-Valued_Random_Variables","242543144_On_the_best_constants_in_the_Khinchin_inequality","238225952_Etudes_des_coefficients_Fourier_des_fonctiones_de_LpG","227308961_Decoupling_of_Banach-valued_multilinear_forms_in_independent_symmetric_Banach-valued_random_variables","226143420_Gelfand_numbers_of_operators_with_values_in_a_Hilbert_space","225685511_Invertibility_of_'large'_submatrices_with_applications_to_the_geometry_of_Banach_spaces_and_harmonic_analysis","225334144_Characterizations_of_almost_surely_continuous_p-stable_random_Fourier_series_and_strongly_stationary_processes","38362263_Conditions_for_Sample-Continuity_and_the_Central_Limit_Theorem","38361359_Random_Multilinear_Forms","38361358_Decoupling_Inequalities_for_Multilinear_Forms_in_Independent_Symmetric_Random_Variables","38361249_Decoupling_Inequalities_for_Polynomial_Chaos","38361052_Comparison_Theorems_Random_Geometry_and_Some_Limit_Theorems_for_Empirical_Processes","7188332_Inequalities_in_Fourier_analysis","2593747_On_the_Convergence_in_Mean_of_Martingale_Difference_Sequences"]}
