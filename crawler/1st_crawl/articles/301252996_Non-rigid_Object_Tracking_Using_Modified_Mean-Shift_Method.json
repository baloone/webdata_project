{"id":"301252996_Non-rigid_Object_Tracking_Using_Modified_Mean-Shift_Method","abstract":"The traditional Mean-Shift algorithm uses a single histogram to tracking moving objects. Because the traditional Mean-Shift lacks spatial distribution information, so it is difficult to track non-rigid object especially. With a focus on this problem, an improved Mean-Shift algorithm based on the shape feature and color of the target is presented. The results show that the algorithm can track the non-rigid target in real time, and it has a preferable adaptability and robustness to the irregular motion and deformation of the target.","authors":["Shuqiang Guo","Xuenan Shi","Yanjiao Wang","Xinxin Zhou"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-0557-2_45","In book: Information Science and Applications (ICISA) 2016 (pp.451-458)"],"references":["224058471_Real_Time_Mean_Shift_Tracking_using_Optical_Flow_Distribution","5917920_Color_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Mean_Shift_and_Normalized_Cuts","2567941_Color_Features_for_Tracking_Non-Rigid_Objects","242637410_The_estimation_of_the_gradient_of_a_density_function","221364960_A_Topological_Approach_to_Hierarchical_Segmentation_using_Mean_Shift","221363643_Acceleration_Strategies_for_Gaussian_Mean-Shift_Image_Segmentation","221362332_Tracking_of_a_non-rigid_object_via_patch-based_dynamic_appearance_modeling_and_adaptive_Basin_Hopping_Monte_Carlo_sampling","4076168_Real_time_hand_tracking_by_computing_particle_filtering_and_mean_Shift","4022789_Mean-shift_Blob_Tracking_through_Scale_Space","3082499_Hostetler_LD_The_estimation_of_the_gradient_of_a_density_function_with_applications_in_pattern_recognition_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_IT-21_32-40"]}
