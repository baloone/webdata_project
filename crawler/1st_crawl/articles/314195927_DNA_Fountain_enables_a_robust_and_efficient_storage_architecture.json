{"id":"314195927_DNA_Fountain_enables_a_robust_and_efficient_storage_architecture","abstract":"DNA is an attractive medium to store digital information. Here we report a storage strategy, called DNA Fountain, that is highly robust and approaches the information capacity per nucleotide. Using our approach, we stored a full computer operating system, movie, and other files with a total of 2.14 × 10⁶ bytes in DNA oligonucleotides and perfectly retrieved the information from a sequencing coverage equivalent to a single tile of Illumina sequencing. We also tested a process that can allow 2.18 × 10¹⁵ retrievals using the original DNA sample and were able to perfectly decode the data. Finally, we explored the limit of our architecture in terms of bytes per molecule and obtained a perfect retrieval from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, orders of magnitude higher than previous reports.","authors":["Yaniv Erlich","Dina Zielinski"],"meta":["March 2017Science 355(6328):950-954","DOI:10.1126/science.aaj2038"],"references":["279969077_DNA-Based_Storage_Trends_and_Methods","276211156_A_Rewritable_Random-Access_DNA-Based_Storage_System","262974149_Raptor_Codes","258062174_PEAR_a_fast_and_accurate_illumina_Paired-End_reAd_mergeR","238863550_Waiting_Time_Distributions_of_Simple_and_Compound_Patterns_in_a_Sequence_of_r_-th_Order_Markov_Dependent_Multistate_Trials","236967013_Characterizing_and_measuring_bias_in_sequence_data","235375794_Towards_practical_high-capacity_low-maintenance_information_storage_in_synthesized_DNA","233929940_Distinct_Mutational_Behaviors_Differentiate_Short_Tandem_Repeats_from_Microsatellites_in_the_Human_Genome","230698422_Next-Generation_Digital_Information_Storage_in_DNA","230686432_Not_All_Sequence_Tags_Are_Created_Equal_Designing_and_Validating_Sequence_Identification_Tags_Robust_to_Indels","223186036_A_generalized_geometric_distribution_and_some_of_its_properties","221498536_LT_codes","51862299_Efficiency_Error_and_Yield_in_Light-Directed_Maskless_Synthesis_of_DNA_Microarrays","49640997_Scalable_gene_synthesis_by_selective_amplification_of_DNA_pools_from_high-fidelity_microchips","43347697_Phenotypic_connections_in_surprising_places","37464186_Application_Layer_Forward_Error_Correction_for_Mobile_Multimedia_Broadcasting","24432880_DNA_Sudoku_-_Harnessing_high-throughput_sequencing_for_multiplexed_specimen_analysis","11792112_Long-term_storage_of_information_in_DNA","3234866_A_Digital_Fountain_Approach_to_Asynchronous_Reliable_Multicast","303919223_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","303905278_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","303746023_Forward_Error_Correction_for_DNA_Data_Storage","274102559_Long-Term_Storage_of_Information_in_DNA","272029638_Robust_Chemical_Preservation_of_Digital_Information_on_DNA_in_Silica_with_Error-Correcting_Codes","264396413_Gene_Assembly_from_Chip-Synthesized_Oligonucleotides","261997387_Large-scale_de_novo_DNA_synthesis_Technologies_and_applications","235272373_Molecular_cybernetics_The_next_step","230657331_Accurate_gene_synthesis_with_tag-directed_retrieval_of_sequence-verified_DNA_molecules","228338081_Efficient_Fountain_Codes_for_Medium_Blocklengths","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","50269060_Efficient_Study_Design_for_Next_Generation_Sequencing","49642577_Quake_Quality-aware_detection_and_correction_of_sequencing_errors","23636527_On_geometric_distributions_of_order_k1km","13988269_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","3350547_Fountain_Codes"]}
