{"id":"280962359_Generalized_Frames_with_C-Valued_Bounds_and_their_Operator_Duals","abstract":"Certain facts about frames and generalized frames are extended for the new 1-frames, referred\nas �-1-frames, in a Hilbert C�-modules. As a matter of fact, some relations are establish between �-frames\nand �-1-frames in a Hilbert C�-module. Furthermore, the paper studies the operators associated to a given\n�-1-frame, the construction of new �-1-frames. Moreover, the operator duals for a �-1-frame are introduced\nand their properties are investigated. Finally, operator duals of a �-1-frame are characterized.","authors":["Azadeh Alijani"],"meta":["July 2015Filomat 29(7):1469–1479","DOI:10.2298/FIL1507469A"],"references":["266001922_-Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","235969343_G-frames_and_their_duals_for_Hilbert_C-modules","220514619_Fusion_Frames_and_G-Frames_in_Hilbert_C-Modules","2422784_Adjointability_Of_Operators_On_Hilbert_C-Modules","2097107_Frames_in_Hilbert_C-modules_and_C-algebras","268549736_G-dual_frames_in_Hilbert_spaces","254468740_Hilbert_C-modules_in_which_all_closed_submodules_are_complemented","243014773_Some_properties_of_g-frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","222539277_G-frames_and_G-Riesz_Bases"]}
