{"id":"318044167_Cybernetics_Design","abstract":"The history of the science of Cybernetics started in second world war while an American mathematician and philosopher Prof. Norbert Wiener was working to design and manufacture new kind of anti aircraft defense system. Wiener and his colleagues announced a new branch of pragmatic science. He stated,“Cybernetics is the science of information feedback by Subject-oriented control” (T.W. Bynum, n.d). Wiener defined the word cybernetics as science of controlling a machine or living being by using automatic communication system which has feedback to any data propose to its memorial system (Wiener 1948, p. 19). Cybernetics is the science of connection between many concepts and disciplines. Today this science is established and interacted in many subjects such as design, mechanical and electrical engineering and biology which can be subdivided to many other fields such as computer science, engineering, management, mathematics, psychology, sociology, education, art, architecture and design etc. it means it is possible to control anything or any system by using technology.","authors":["Parsa Kian"],"meta":["May 2017"],"references":["287319297_Cybernetics_from_Past_to_Future","22310482_Spatial_mapping_in_the_primate_sensory_projection_Analytic_structure_and_relevance_to_perception","2537468_Norbert_Wiener's_Vision_The_Impact_of_the_Automatic_Age_on_Our_Moral_Lives","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","221936221_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","220545842_P_H_Winston_Artificial_Intelligence_2nd_Ed","200027521_Cybernetics_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine"]}
