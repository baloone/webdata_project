{"id":"8100146_Dynamic_Range_Reduction_Inspired_by_Photoreceptor_Physiology","abstract":"A common task in computer graphics is the mapping of digital high dynamic range images to low dynamic range display devices such as monitors and printers. This task is similar to the adaptation processes which occur in the human visual system. Physiological evidence suggests that adaptation already occurs in the photoreceptors, leading to a straightforward model that can be easily adapted for tone reproduction. The result is a fast and practical algorithm for general use with intuitive user parameters that control intensity, contrast, and level of chromatic adaptation, respectively.","authors":["Erik Reinhard","Kate Devlin"],"meta":["January 2005IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 11(1):13-24","DOI:10.1109/TVCG.2005.9","SourcePubMed"],"references":["259241933_Rendering_high_dynamic_range_images","255682296_Parameter_Estimation_for_Photographic_Tone_Reproduction","244437006_Perceptual_Evaluation_of_Tone_Mapping_Operators_with_Regard_to_Similarity_and_Preference","312652591_The_visible_difference_predictor_an_algorithm_for_assessment_of_image_fidelity_in_Digital_Images_and_Human_Vision","310328700_The_retina_an_approachable_part_of_the_brain","273056712_The_Retina_An_Approachable_Part_of_the_Brain","253395684_Color_Science_Concepts_and_Methods_Quantitative_Data_and_Formulae_2nd_Edition","246776490_Psychophysical_tests_of_models_of_the_response-intensity_function","244435008_Meet_iCAM_An_image_color_appearance_model","242450410_A_Contrast-based_Scale_Factor_for_Luminance_Display","239596270_The_Application_of_Computer_Graphics_in_Lighting_Design","236121015_Color_Appearance_Models","236121001_The_Visible_Differences_Predictor_An_Algorithm_for_the_Assessment_of_Image_Fidelity","229000020_Adaptive_gain_control_for_high_dynamic_range_image_display","221678023_Color_Science_Concepts_and_Methods_Quantative_Data_and_Formulae"]}
