{"id":"317841810_More_Is_Better_Recent_Progress_in_Multi-Omics_Data_Integration_Methods","abstract":"Multi-omics data integration is one of the major challenges in the era of precision medicine. Considerable work has been done with the advent of high-throughput studies, which have enabled the data access for downstream analyses. To improve the clinical outcome prediction, a gamut of software tools has been developed. This review outlines the progress done in the field of multi-omics integration and comprehensive tools developed so far in this field. Further, we discuss the integration methods to predict patient survival at the end of the review.","authors":["Sijia Huang","Kumardeep Chaudhary","Lana Xia Garmire"],"meta":["June 2017Frontiers in Genetics 8:84","DOI:10.3389/fgene.2017.00084"],"references":["305319546_Meta-dimensional_data_integration_identifies_critical_pathways_for_susceptibility_tumorigenesis_and_progression_of_endometrial_cancer","299539868_Novel_personalized_pathway-based_metabolomics_models_reveal_key_metabolic_pathways_for_breast_cancer_diagnosis","287482858_Network-Based_Integration_of_Disparate_Omic_Data_To_Identify_Silent_Players_in_Cancer","278331745_Integrating_different_data_types_by_regularized_unsupervised_multiple_kernel_learning_with_application_to_cancer_subtype_discovery","312055521_Using_knowledge-driven_genomic_interactions_for_multi-omics_data_analysis_Metadimensional_models_for_predicting_clinical_outcomes_in_ovarian_carcinoma","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","292953567_Integrative_analysis_for_identifying_joint_modular_patterns_of_gene-expression_and_drug-response_data","287582514_Data_Integration_for_Cancer_Clinical_Outcome_Prediction","271642324_Integration_of_biological_networks_and_gene_expression_data_using_Cytoscape","270910379_Methods_of_integrating_data_to_uncover_genotype-phenotype_interactions"]}
