The main national and international journals were consulted, resulting in 47 articles, which were divided into three categories for analysis: Research (n=27), Proposals Application (n=9) and Proposals (n=11). Regarding the research methodologies, predominantly quantitative (n = 9), with a balance between pre-experimental, experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and mixed methods, in which most of the articles (n = 6) presents research design Integrated. We identified a trend of teaching methods are sorely based on trial and error, since, in general, are not used emplacements in learning theories, which orientate the professional practices. As for the theoretical framework of ill-structured problems, prevailing conceptions of Jonassen.","authors":["Vagner Oliveira","Ives Solano Araujo","Eliane Angela Veit"],"meta":["January 2017Revista Brasileira de Ensino de FÃ­sica 39(3)","DOI:10.1590/1806-9126-rbef-2016-0269"],"references":["237670954_Introducing_Ill-Structured_Problems_in_Introductory_Physics_Recitations","233222559_Some_real_problems_in_the_physics_of_comets","226349031_Talking_Physics_during_Small-Group_Work_with_Context-Rich_Problems_-_Analysed_from_an_Ownership_Perspective","225213472_From_Everyday_Life_Experiences_to_Physics_Understanding_Occurring_in_Small_Group_Work_with_Context_Rich_Problems_During_Introductory_Physics_Work_at_University","320827615_Reflections_on_educational_technology_research_and_development","305193002_Learning_to_Solve_Problems_An_Instructional_Design_Guide","235000367_Using_Conceptual_Scaffolding_to_Foster_Effective_Problem_Solving","231137946_The_physics_of_Colonel_Kittinger's_longest_lonely_leap","226835741_Examining_the_effect_of_problem_type_in_a_synchronous_computer-supported_collaborative_learning_CSCL_environment"]}
