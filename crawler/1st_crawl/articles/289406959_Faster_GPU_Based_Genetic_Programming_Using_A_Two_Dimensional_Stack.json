{"id":"289406959_Faster_GPU_Based_Genetic_Programming_Using_A_Two_Dimensional_Stack","abstract":"Genetic Programming (GP) is a computationally intensive technique which also\nhas a high degree of natural parallelism. Parallel computing architectures have\nbecome commonplace especially with regards Graphics Processing Units (GPU).\nHence, versions of GP have been implemented that utilise these highly parallel\ncomputing platforms enabling significant gains in the computational speed of GP\nto be achieved. However, recently a two dimensional stack approach to GP using\na multi-core CPU also demonstrated considerable performance gains. Indeed,\nperformances equivalent to or exceeding that achieved by a GPU were\ndemonstrated. This paper will demonstrate that a similar two dimensional stack\napproach can also be applied to a GPU based approach to GP to better exploit\nthe underlying technology. Performance gains are achieved over a standard\nsingle dimensional stack approach when utilising a GPU. Overall, a peak\ncomputational speed of over 55 billion Genetic Programming Operations per\nSecond are observed, a two fold improvement over the best GPU based single\ndimensional stack approach from the literature.","authors":["Darren M.
