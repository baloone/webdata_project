{"id":"329843903_Solar_Powered_Smart_Irrigation_System_Using_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"In the present scenario, availability of power and water are insufficient to satisfy the farmerâ€™s requirements. Traditionally, implemented techniques of irrigation are proving to be less futile as these are not good at multitasking different concerns which is a combination of availability of water, sources of energy and timely soil profile analysis. With the merger of automation and the methods of irrigation used earlier, the scope to mitigate issues concerning water and power crisis, is huge. In this paper, an Internet of Things based solar powered smart irrigation system with monitoring and control features, is designed and implemented. The sensor enabled proposed model of smart irrigation system along with its Android Application and ESP8266 as its main controller is successfully implemented and the results of the implemented are presented.","authors":["Kshirod Rout","samuchita Mallick","Sivkumar Mishra"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICDSBA.2018.00033","Conference: 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Business Analytics (ICDSBA 2018 )At: ChangSha, Hunan, China","Project: smart solar  monitoring system using IoT"],"references":["327174859_Design_and_Implementation_of_an_Internet_of_Things_Based_Prototype_for_Smart_Home_Automation_System","325983795_Smart_automated_irrigation_system_with_disease_prediction","326076166_IoT_based_solar_powered_Agribot_for_irrigation_and_farm_monitoring_Agribot_for_irrigation_and_farm_monitoring","326073308_IoT_based_smart_crop-field_monitoring_and_automation_irrigation_system","325918691_IoT_based_control_and_automation_of_smart_irrigation_system_An_automated_irrigation_system_using_sensors_GSM_Bluetooth_and_cloud_technology","323196731_Mobile_integrated_smart_irrigation_management_and_monitoring_system_using_IOT","322880575_IoT_based_smart_soil_monitoring_system_for_agricultural_production","322872529_Automated_irrigation_with_advanced_seed_germination_and_pest_control","322710091_Design_and_Implementation_of_Smart_Irrigation_System_Based_on_LoRa","322589277_Agro-tech_A_digital_model_for_monitoring_soil_and_crops_using_internet_of_things_IOT"]}
