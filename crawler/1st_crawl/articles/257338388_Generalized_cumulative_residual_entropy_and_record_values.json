{"id":"257338388_Generalized_cumulative_residual_entropy_and_record_values","abstract":"The Shannon entropy of a random variable has become a very useful tool in Probability Theory. In this paper we extend the concept of cumulative residual entropy introduced by Rao et al. (in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 50:1220â€“1228, 2004). The new concept called generalized cumulative residual entropy (GCRE) is related with the record values of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and with the relevation transform. We also consider a dynamic GCRE obtained using the residual lifetime. For these concepts we obtain some characterization results, stochastic ordering and aging classes properties and some relationships with other entropy concepts.","authors":["Georgios Psarrakos","Navarro Jorge"],"meta":["July 2013Metrika 76(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00184-012-0408-6"],"references":["233183073_Some_results_on_the_mean_residual_waiting_time_of_records","226878582_Some_Results_on_Residual_Entropy_Function","3085071_Cumulative_Residual_Entropy_A_New_Measure_of_Information","334946176_On_the_dynamic_cumulative_residual_entropy","305974127_New_partial_ordering_of_survival_functions_based_on_the_notion_of_uncertainty","285201382_How_to_measure_uncertainty_about_residual_lifetime","268863379_Order_Statistics","267478399_Stochastic_Orders","265369175_New_Partial_Ordering_of_Survival_Functions_Based_on_the_Notion_of_Uncertainty","265329243_How_to_measure_uncertainty_in_the_life_time_distributions","264948933_The_Relevation_Transform_and_a_Generalization_of_the_Gamma_Distribution_Function","259418245_Some_extensions_of_the_residual_lifetime_and_its_connection_to_the_cumulative_residual_entropy","242997790_Some_new_results_on_the_cumulative_residual_entropy","233400020_Stochastic_ordering_properties_for_systems_with_dependent_identically_distributed_components","233363213_Dynamic_cumulative_residual_Renyi's_entropy","233172712_Characterizations_Based_on_Cumulative_Residual_Entropy_of_First-Order_Statistics","231818795_Closure_and_Monotonicity_Properties_of_Nonhomogeneous_Poisson_Processes_and_Record_Values","229702405_Reliability_Applications_of_the_Relevation_Transform","225786773_More_on_a_New_Concept_of_Entropy_and_Information"]}
