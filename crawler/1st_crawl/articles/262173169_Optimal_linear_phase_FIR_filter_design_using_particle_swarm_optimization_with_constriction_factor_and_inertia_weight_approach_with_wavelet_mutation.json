Real coded genetic algorithm RGA, particle swarm optimization PSO and particle swarm optimization with constriction factor and inertia weight PSOCFIWA have also been adopted for the sake of comparison. PSOCFIWA-WM incorporates a new definition of swarm updating in PSOCFIWA with the help of wavelet based mutation. Wavelet mutation enhances the effectiveness of PSOCFIWA to explore the multidimensional solution space more effectively. In this design approach, filter length, pass band and stop band edge frequencies, feasible pass band and stop band ripple sizes are specified. A comparison of simulation results reveals the optimization superiority of the proposed technique over the other optimization techniques for the solution of FIR low pass LP, high pass HP, band pass BP and band stop BS filter designs.","authors":["S.
