{"id":"330881323_Using_Partial_Least_Squares_to_Measure_Tourism_Students'_Satisfaction_with_Work-Integrated_Learning","abstract":"Work-integrated learning placement experience can either validate or contradict students’ expectations regarding the industry, job roles and interests, expectations of industry employers, and personal fit with the profession. Determining students’ satisfaction with the placement experience will provide valuable insight to academic institutions. This chapter will explore the preplacement expectations and postplacement perceptions of tourism students and propose a conceptual model for the tourism student’s satisfaction with work-integrated learning. Data were collected using a survey of third-year tourism students. A conceptual model was proposed and analyzed using SmartPLS. The analysis indicated that postplacement perceptions have a significant influence on the satisfaction of WIL. The conceptual model showed an R2 value of 0.427, indicating a substantial impact on satisfaction with WIL.","authors":["Tish Taylor","Sue Geldenhuys"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.5772/intechopen.82048","In book: TourismPublisher: IntechOpen","Project: Work integrated learning"],"references":["325465995_Tourism_students'_experience_of_work-integrated_learning","325319612_A_baseline_study_of_the_gaps_in_work-integrated_Tourism_learning_student_expectations_and_perceptions","311766005_The_Partial_Least_Squares_Approach_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","310666074_An_exploratory_investigation_of_college_students'_views_of_marketing_internships","261295147_SEM-PLS_Analysis_of_Inhibiting_Factors_of_Cost_Performance_for_Large_Construction_Projects_in_Malaysia_Perspective_of_Clients_and_Consultants","258046807_Partial_Least_Squares_Structural_Equation_Modeling_PLS-SEM_An_Emerging_Tool_for_Business_Research","325004095_Determinants_of_Internship_Effectiveness_An_Exploratory_Model","309047736_Internship_impact_on_career_consideration_among_business_students","285179773_Partial_Least_Squares_Analysis","257601137_Revisiting_hospitality_internship_practices_A_holistic_investigation","247123855_Securing_graduate_commitment_An_exploration_of_the_comparative_expectations_of_placement_students_graduate_recruits_and_human_resource_managers_within_the_hospitality_leisure_and_tourism_industries","255575880_Sample_size_estimation_using_Krejcie_and_Morgan_and_Cohen_statistical_power_analysis_A_comparison","254266711_Evaluating_the_quality_of_work-integrated_learning_curricula_A_comprehensive_framework","247506695_Korean_students'_perceptions_of_the_effectiveness_of_their_internship_experiences_in_the_hospitality_industry_in_Korea","242162590_Online_resources_for_Work_Integrated_Learning_A_case_study_in_re-usability_and_flexibility"]}
