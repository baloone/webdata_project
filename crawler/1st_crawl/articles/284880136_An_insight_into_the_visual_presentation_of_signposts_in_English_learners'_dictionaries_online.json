{"id":"284880136_An_insight_into_the_visual_presentation_of_signposts_in_English_learners'_dictionaries_online","abstract":"The aim of the paper is to evaluate the methods for presenting signposts which are used in online versions of three monolinecv040gual\nEnglish learnersâ€™ dictionaries: LDOCE5, OALD8 and OALD9. In these dictionaries, signposts take the form of, respectively,\nwhite capitals on a blue background, crimson capitals above a crimson line, and black lower-case letters above a dark orange\nline. The study aims to determine which of these signpost highlighting methods is the most beneficial to the speed and accuracy\nof sense identification as well as meaning retention. It also attempts to establish whether sense position in the entry affects\nthe time and success of sense identification as well as the retention of meaning when different strategies for presenting\nsignposts are adopted. In a Moodle-based experiment, purpose-built entries with manipulated signpost highlighting were employed\nand target sense positions were strictly controlled. The results indicate that the LDOCE5 method for highlighting signposts\nis generally the most recommendable.","authors":["Anna Dziemianko"],"meta":["November 2015International Journal of Lexicography 29(4):ecv040","DOI:10.1093/ijl/ecv040"],"references":["265252070_Do_Menus_Provide_Added_Value_to_Signposts_in_Print_Monolingual_Dictionary_Entries_An_Application_of_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Modelling_in_Dictionary_User_Research","31248190_A_New_Type_of_Folk-Inspired_Definition_In_English_Monolingual_Learners'_Dictionaries_and_its_Usefulness_for_Conveying_Syntactic_Information","276333897_Colours_in_Online_Dictionaries_A_Case_of_Functional_Labels","254771806_When_Do_Foreign-Language_Readers_Look_Up_the_Meaning_of_Unfamiliar_Words_The_Influence_of_Task_and_Learner_Variables","249239060_Dictionary_use_in_reception"]}
