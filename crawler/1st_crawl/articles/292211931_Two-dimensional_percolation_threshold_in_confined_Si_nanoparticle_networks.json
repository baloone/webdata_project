{"id":"292211931_Two-dimensional_percolation_threshold_in_confined_Si_nanoparticle_networks","abstract":"Non-percolating and percolating siliconquantum dot(QD) networks were investigated by plane-view energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM). The Si QD networks were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition on free standing 5 nm Si3N4 membranes, followed by high temperature annealing. The percolation threshold from non-percolating to percolating networks is found to be in between a SiOxstoichiometry of SiO0.5 up to SiO0.7. Using the EF-TEM images, key structural parameters of the Si QD ensemble were extracted and compared, i.e., their size distribution, nearest neighbor distance, and circularity. Increasing the silicon excess within the SiOx layer results in an ensemble of closer spaced, less size-controlled, and less circular Si QDs that give rise to coupling effects. Furthermore, the influence of the structural parameters on the optical and electrical Si QD ensemble properties is discussed.","authors":["J.
