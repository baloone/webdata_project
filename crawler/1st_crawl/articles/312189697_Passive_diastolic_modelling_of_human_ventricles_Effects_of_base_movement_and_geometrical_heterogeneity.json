{"id":"312189697_Passive_diastolic_modelling_of_human_ventricles_Effects_of_base_movement_and_geometrical_heterogeneity","abstract":"Left-ventricular (LV) remodelling, associated with diastolic heart failure, is driven by an increase in myocardial stress. Therefore, normalisation of LV wall stress is the cornerstone of many therapeutic treatments. However, information regarding such regional stress-strain for human LV is still limited. Thus, the objectives of our study were to determine local diastolic stress-strain field in healthy LVs, and consequently, to identify the regional variations amongst them due to geometric heterogeneity. Effects of LV base movement on diastolic model predictions, which were ignored in the literature, were further explored. Personalised finite-element modelling of five normal human bi-ventricles was carried out using subject-specific myocardium properties. Model prediction was validated individually through comparison with end-diastolic volume and a new shape-volume based measurement of LV cavity, extracted from magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that incorporation of LV base movement improved the model predictions (shape-volume relevancy of LV cavity), and therefore, it should be considered in future studies. The LV endocardium always experienced higher fibre stress compared to the epicardium for all five subjects. The LV wall near base experienced higher stress compared to equatorial and apical locations. The lateral LV wall underwent greater stress distribution (fibre and sheet stress) compared to other three regions. In addition, normal ranges of different stress-strain components in different regions of LV wall were reported for five healthy ventricles. This information could be used as targets for future computational studies to optimise diastolic heart failure treatments or design new therapeutic interventions/devices.","authors":["Arnab
