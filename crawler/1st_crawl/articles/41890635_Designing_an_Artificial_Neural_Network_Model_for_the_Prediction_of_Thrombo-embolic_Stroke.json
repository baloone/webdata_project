{"id":"41890635_Designing_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_Model_for_the_Prediction_of_Thrombo-embolic_Stroke","abstract":"In this study, a functional model of ANN is proposed to aid existing diagnosismethods. This work investigated the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) inpredicting the Thrombo-embolic stroke disease. The Backpropogation algorithmwas used to train the ANN architecture and the same has been tested for thevarious categories of stroke disease. This research work demonstrates that theANN based prediction of stroke disease improves the diagnosis accuracy withhigher consistency. This ANN exhibits good performance in the prediction ofstroke disease in general.","authors":["Dumpala Shanthi","Gadadhar Sahoo","Dr.N.Saravanan"],"meta":["March 2009"],"references":["6828771_Comparison_between_neural_networks_and_multiple_logistic_regression_to_predict_acute_coronary_syndrome_in_the_emergency_room","242348381_Failure_rate_prediction_with_artificial_neural_networks","234956048_Applications_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_II","15722708_Application_of_artificial_neural_networks_to_clinical_medicine","14127923_Neural_network_based_on_adaptive_resonance_theory_as_compared_to_experts_in_suggesting_treatment_for_schizophrenic_and_unipolar_depressed_in-patients","12716875_A_neural_network_approach_to_the_biopsy_diagnosis_of_early_acute_renal_transplant_rejection","11530832_An_Ischemia_Detection_Method_Based_on_Artificial_Neural_Networks","10618928_Predicting_mortality_in_patients_with_cirrhosis_of_liver_with_application_of_neural_network_technology","8062082_Comparison_of_Standard_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_Estimators_of_Hemodialysis_Adequacy","6848222_The_added_value_of_ECG-gating_for_the_diagnosis_of_myocardial_infarction_using_myocardial_perfusion_scintigraphy_and_artificial_neural_networks","3787313_Low_computational_cost_classifiers_for_ECG_diagnosis_using_neural_networks","3034493_Classification_of_cardiac_arrhythmias_using_fuzzy_ARTMAP"]}
