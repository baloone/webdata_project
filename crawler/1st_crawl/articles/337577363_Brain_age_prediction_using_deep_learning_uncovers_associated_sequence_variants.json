{"id":"337577363_Brain_age_prediction_using_deep_learning_uncovers_associated_sequence_variants","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms can be trained to estimate age from brain structural MRI. The difference between an individual’s predicted and chronological age, predicted age difference (PAD), is a phenotype of relevance to aging and brain disease. Here, we present a new deep learning approach to predict brain age from a T1-weighted MRI. The method was trained on a dataset of healthy Icelanders and tested on two datasets, IXI and UK Biobank, utilizing transfer learning to improve accuracy on new sites. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PAD in the UK Biobank data (discovery set: \\(N=12378\\), replication set: \\(N=4456\\)) yielded two sequence variants, rs1452628-T (\\(\\beta =-0.08\\), \\(P=1.15\\times{10}^{-9}\\)) and rs2435204-G (\\(\\beta =0.102\\), \\(P=9.73\\times 1{0}^{-12}\\)). The former is near KCNK2 and correlates with reduced sulcal width, whereas the latter correlates with reduced white matter surface area and tags a well-known inversion at 17q21.31 (H2).","authors":["Benedikt Atli Jónsson","Gyda Bjornsdottir","Thorgeir Thorgeirsson","Lotta Ellingsen"],"meta":["November 2019Nature Communications 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-13163-9","Project: Brain age prediction"],"references":["336020116_Common_brain_disorders_are_associated_with_heritable_patterns_of_apparent_aging_of_the_brain","329437954_eQTL_of_KCNK2_regionally_influences_the_brain_sulcal_widening_evidence_from_15597_UK_Biobank_participants_with_neuroimaging_data","328200050_The_UK_Biobank_resource_with_deep_phenotyping_and_genomic_data","328200049_Genome-wide_association_studies_of_brain_imaging_phenotypes_in_UK_Biobank","326558971_Gene_discovery_and_polygenic_prediction_from_a_genome-wide_association_study_of_educational_attainment_in_11_million_individuals","325975934_Meta-analysis_of_genome-wide_association_studies_for_neuroticism_in_449484_individuals_identifies_novel_genetic_loci_and_pathways","334941824_Meta-analysis_of_genome-wide_association_studies_for_neuroticism_in_449484_individuals_identifies_novel_genetic_loci_and_pathways","325916149_Analysis_of_shared_heritability_in_common_disorders_of_the_brain","323107797_Lig4-4_selectively_inhibits_TREK-1_and_plays_potent_neuroprotective_roles_in_vitro_and_in_rat_MCAO_model","322559865_Statistical_Challenges_in_Big_Data_Human_Neuroimaging"]}
