{"id":"269339078_Entropy_of_unimodular_Lattice_Triangulations","abstract":"Triangulations are important objects of study in combinatorics, finite\nelement simulations and quantum gravity, where its entropy is crucial for many\nphysical properties. Due to their inherent complex topological structure even\nthe number of possible triangulations is unknown for large systems. We present\na novel algorithm for an approximate enumeration which is based on calculations\nof the density of states using the Wang-Landau flat histogram sampling. For\ntriangulations on two-dimensional integer lattices we achive excellent\nagreement with known exact numbers of small triangulations as well as an\nimprovement of analytical calculated asymptotics. The entropy density is\n$C=2.196(3)$ consistent with rigorous upper and lower bounds. The presented\nnumerical scheme can easily be applied to other counting and optimization\nproblems.","authors":["Johannes F.
