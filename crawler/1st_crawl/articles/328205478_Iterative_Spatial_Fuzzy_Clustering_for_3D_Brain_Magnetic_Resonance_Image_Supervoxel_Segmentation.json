This work makes use of the common topology among the human brains to obtain a set of seed templates from a population-based brain template MRI image. After selecting the number of supervoxels, the corresponding seed template is projected onto the considered individual brain for generating reliable seeds. Then, to deal with the influence of partial volume effect, an efficient iterative spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to allocate voxels to the seeds and to generate the supervoxels for the overall brain MRI volume.\n\nResults: \nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on two widely used public brain MRI datasets and compared with three other up-to-date methods.\n\nConclusions: \nThe proposed algorithm can be utilized for several brain MRI processing and analysis, including tissue segmentation, tumor detection and segmentation, functional parcellation and registration.","authors":["Youyong Kong","Jiasong Wu","Guanyu Yang","Yulin Zuo"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Neuroscience Methods 311","DOI:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.10.007"],"references":[]}
