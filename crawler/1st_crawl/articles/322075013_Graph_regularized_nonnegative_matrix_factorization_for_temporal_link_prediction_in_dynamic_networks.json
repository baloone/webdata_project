{"id":"322075013_Graph_regularized_nonnegative_matrix_factorization_for_temporal_link_prediction_in_dynamic_networks","abstract":"Many networks derived from society and nature are temporal and incomplete. The temporal link prediction problem in networks is to predict links at time T+1 based on a given temporal network from time 1 to T, which is essential to important applications. The current algorithms either predict the temporal links by collapsing the dynamic networks or collapsing features derived from each network, which are criticized for ignoring the connection among slices. to overcome the issue, we propose a novel graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (GrNMF) for the temporal link prediction problem without collapsing the dynamic networks. To obtain the feature for each network from 1 to t, GrNMF factorizes the matrix associated with networks by setting the rest networks as regularization, which provides a better way to characterize the topological information of temporal links. Then, the GrNMF algorithm collapses the feature matrices to predict temporal links. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm exhibits significantly improved accuracy by avoiding the collapse of temporal networks. Experimental results of a number of artificial and real temporal networks illustrate that the proposed method is not only more accurate but also more robust than state-of-the-art approaches.","authors":["Xiaoke Ma","Penggang Sun","Yu Wang"],"meta":["December 2017Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 496","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2017.12.092"],"references":["317399449_Predicting_drug-target_interactions_via_sparse_learning","312868957_Evolutionary_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_Algorithms_for_Community_Detection_in_Dynamic_Networks","304270363_Link_Prediction_via_Matrix_Completion","285668548_Gene_ontology_Tool_for_the_unification_of_biology","281820656_Prediction_of_Links_and_Weights_in_Networks_by_Reliable_Routes","261922679_Modeling_Disease_Progression_Using_Dynamics_of_Pathway_Connectivity","249320261_Network_link_prediction_by_global_silencing_of_indirect_correlations","221653291_Exploiting_Place_Features_in_Link_Prediction_on_Location-based_Social_Networks","220766678_Cross-Temporal_Link_Prediction","220765682_Link_Prediction_on_Evolving_Data_Using_Matrix_and_Tensor_Factorizations","220520107_Link_mining_A_survey","209716211_Learning_Spectral_Graph_Transformations_for_Link_Prediction","45919126_Temporal_Link_Prediction_Using_Matrix_and_Tensor_Factorizations","23699658_Molecular_Origins_of_Cancer_Molecular_Basis_of_Metastasis","12752937_Learning_the_Parts_of_Objects_by_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization","6412158_Quantifying_social_group_evolution","5383131_An_in_Vivo_Map_of_the_Yeast_Protein_Interactome","5376439_Estimating_the_size_of_human_interactome","3297672_Random-Walk_Computation_of_Similarities_between_Nodes_of_a_Graph_with_Application_to_Collaborative_Recommendation","317693700_Nonnegative_matrix_factorization_algorithms_for_link_prediction_in_temporal_networks_using_graph_communicability","305313303_Scalable_Temporal_Latent_Space_Inference_for_Link_Prediction_in_Dynamic_Social_Networks","304496880_Link_prediction_in_complex_networks_A_survey","301307594_Link_prediction_based_on_temporal_similarity_metrics_using_continuous_action_set_learning_automata","285943194_Hitting_and_Commute_Times_in_Large_Random_Neighborhood_Graphs","280773148_Modern_temporal_network_theory_A_colloquium","271468677_Constructing_Topical_Hierarchies_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","256822555_Multiple_graph_regularized_nonnegative_matrix_factorization","227588355_Predicting_Missing_Links_via_Local_Information","225772429_Resistance_distance_and_Laplacian_spectrum","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","224207514_Graph_Regularized_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_for_Data_Representation","222652810_Effects_of_Missing_Data_in_Social_Networks","221996591_The_PageRank_Citation_Ranking_Bringing_Order_to_the_Web","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","221867590_Ensemble_Manifold_Regularization","220765615_Temporal-Relational_Classifiers_for_Prediction_in_Evolving_Domains","51964964_Temporal_Networks","51798957_Dynamic_social_networks_promote_cooperation_in_experiments_with_humans","51796768_Coordinate_descent_algorithm_for_nonconvex_penalized_regression_with_application_to_biological_feature_selection","41706537_Link_prediction_in_weighted_networks_The_role_of_weak_ties","23716799_A_State-Space_Mixed_Membership_Blockmodel_for_Dynamic_Network_Tomography","5400591_Hierarchical_structure_and_the_prediction_of_missing_links_in_networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks"]}
