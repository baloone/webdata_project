{"id":"253993277_A_multilayer_structured_acoustic_cloak_with_homogeneous_isotropic_materials","abstract":"An acoustic cloak with concentric alternating layered structure is designed with homogeneous isotropic materials on the basis of effective medium theory. The cloak possesses low-reflection and power-flow bending properties for different shapes of wavefront both in far- and near-fields, which could perfectly approximate the ideal cloak with inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of material parameters.","authors":["Ying Cheng","Fan Yang","J.
