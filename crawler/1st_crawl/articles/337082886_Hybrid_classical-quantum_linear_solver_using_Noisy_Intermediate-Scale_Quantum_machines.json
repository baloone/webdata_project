{"id":"337082886_Hybrid_classical-quantum_linear_solver_using_Noisy_Intermediate-Scale_Quantum_machines","abstract":"We propose a realistic hybrid classical-quantum linear solver to solve systems of linear equations of a specific type, and demonstrate its feasibility with Qiskit on IBM Q systems. This algorithm makes use of quantum random walk that runs in [Formula: see text](N log(N)) time on a quantum circuit made of [Formula: see text](log(N)) qubits. The input and output are classical data, and so can be easily accessed. It is robust against noise, and ready for implementation in applications such as machine learning.","authors":["Chih-Chieh Chen","Shiue-Yuan Shiau","Ming-Feng Wu","Yuh-Renn Wu"],"meta":["November 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-52275-6","Project: Quantum algorithm"],"references":["334490779_Quantum_annealing_for_systems_of_polynomial_equations","331880297_Hybrid_quantum_linear_equation_algorithm_and_its_experimental_test_on_IBM_Quantum_Experience","323356026_Quantum_linear_systems_algorithms_a_primer","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","346678421_A_Guide_to_Monte_Carlo_Simulations_in_Statistical_Physics","331104562_Quantum_Algorithms_for_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_Inspired_by_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computing","330373469_Experimental_realization_of_quantum_algorithms_for_a_linear_system_inspired_by_adiabatic_quantum_computing","329842882_Analyzing_the_Quantum_Annealing_Approach_for_Solving_Linear_Least_Squares_Problems_13th_International_Conference_WALCOM_2019_Guwahati_India_February_27_-_March_2_2019_Proceedings","321095510_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Simulating_the_Wave_Equation","319683740_Hardware-efficient_variational_quantum_eigensolver_for_small_molecules_and_quantum_magnets"]}
