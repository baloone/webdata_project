{"id":"336078780_ClusCross_a_new_topology_for_silicon_interposer-based_network-on-chip","abstract":"The increasing number of cores challenges the scalability of chip multiprocessors. Recent studies proposed the idea of disintegration by partitioning a large chip into multiple smaller chips and using silicon interposer-based integration (2.5D) to connect these smaller chips. This method can improve yield, but as the number of small chips increases, the chip-to-chip communication becomes a performance bottleneck.\nThis paper proposes a new network topology, ClusCross, to improve network performance for multicore interconnection networks on silicon interposer-based systems. The key idea is to treat each small chip as a cluster and use cross-cluster long links to increase bisection width and decrease average hop count without increasing the number of ports in the routers. Synthetic traffic patterns and real applications are simulated on a cycle-accurate simulator. Network latency reduction and saturation throughput improvement are demonstrated as compared to previously proposed topologies. Two versions of the ClusCross topology are evaluated. One version of ClusCross has a 10% average latency reduction for coherence traffic as compared to the state-of-the-art network-on-interposer topology, the misaligned ButterDonut. The other version of ClusCross has a 7% and a 10% reduction in power consumption as compared to the FoldedTorus and the ButterDonut topologies, respectively.","authors":["Hesam Shabani","Xiaochen Guo"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1145/3313231.3352363","Conference: the 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium"],"references":["320711266_Physical_Design_Challenges_and_Solutions_for_Interposer-Based_3D_System","297077276_Xilinx_stacked_silicon_interconnect_technology_delivers_breakthrough_FPGA_performance","282600116_Heterogeneous_25D_integration_on_through_silicon_interposer","280534413_NoC_Architectures_for_Silicon_Interposer_Systems_Why_Pay_for_more_Wires_when_you_Can_Get_them_from_your_interposer_for_Free","265241440_BookSim_20_User's_Guide","261075330_A_detailed_and_flexible_cycle-accurate_Network-on-Chip_simulator","259603959_A_loss_aware_scalable_topology_for_photonic_on_chip_interconnection_networks","238625662_Principles_and_Practices_of_Interconnection_Network","220915681_Interconnect_characteristics_of_25-D_system_integration_scheme","3904516_Route_packets_not_wires_On-chip_interconnection_networks","319858771_EbDa_A_New_Theory_on_Design_and_Verification_of_Deadlock-free_Interconnection_Networks","311487990_Enabling_interposer-based_disintegration_of_multi-core_processors","307799708_AMD's_next_generation_GPU_and_high_bandwidth_memory_architecture_FURY","266657021_Design_tradeoffs_for_tiled_CMP_on-chip_networks","261458800_Worm-Bubble_Flow_Control","259603944_A_loss_aware_scalable_topology_for_photonic_on_chip_interconnection_networks","243674987_Shahidi_CMOS_Scaling_for_High_Performance_and_Low_Power-The_Next_Ten_Years","228753485_Netrace_dependency-driven_trace-based_network-on-chip_simulation","224189188_Fabrication_Cost_Analysis_and_Cost-Aware_Design_Space_Exploration_for_3-D_ICs","220781831_On-Chip_Network_Evaluation_Framework","220693365_Interconnection_networks_An_engineering_approach","3337814_It's_a_small_world_after_all_NoC_performance_optimization_via_long-range_link_insertion","2984892_CMOS_scaling_for_high_performance_and_low_power-The_next_ten_years"]}
