{"id":"288713575_Rank_error-correcting_pairs","abstract":"Error-correcting pairs were introduced independently by Pellikaan and\nK\\\"otter as a general method of decoding linear codes with respect to the\nHamming metric using coordinatewise products of vectors, and are used for many\nwell-known families of codes. In this paper, we define new types of vector\nproducts, extending the coordinatewise product, some of which preserve symbolic\nproducts of linearized polynomials after evaluation and some of which coincide\nwith usual products of matrices. Then we define rank error-correcting pairs for\ncodes that are linear over the extension field and for codes that are linear\nover the base field, and relate both types. Bounds on the minimum rank distance\nof codes and MRD conditions are given. Finally we show that some well-known\nfamilies of rank-metric codes admit rank error-correcting pairs, and show that\nthe given algorithm generalizes the classical algorithm using error-correcting\npairs for the Hamming metric.","authors":["Umberto Martínez-Peñas","R.
