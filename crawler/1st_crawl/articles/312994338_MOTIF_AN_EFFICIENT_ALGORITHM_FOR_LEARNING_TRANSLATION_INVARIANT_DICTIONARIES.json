{"id":"312994338_MOTIF_AN_EFFICIENT_ALGORITHM_FOR_LEARNING_TRANSLATION_INVARIANT_DICTIONARIES","abstract":"The performances of approximation using redundant expansions rely on having dictionaries adapted to the signals. In natural high-dimensional data, the statistical dependencies are, most of the time, not obvious. Learning fundamental patterns is an alternative to analytical design of bases and is nowadays a popular problem in the field of approximation theory. In many situations, the basis elements are shift invariant, thus the learning should try to find the best matching filters. We present a new algorithm for learning iteratively generating functions that can be translated at all positions in the signal to generate a highly redundant dictionary.","authors":["Philippe Jost","Sylvain Lesage","P.
