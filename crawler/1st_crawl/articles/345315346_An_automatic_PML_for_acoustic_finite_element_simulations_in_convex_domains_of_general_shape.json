The PML is a popular non‐reecting technique that combines accuracy, computational efficiency and geometric exibility. Unfortunately, the effective implementation of the PML for convex domains of general shape is tricky because of the geometric parameters that are required to define the PML medium. In this work, a comprehensive implementation strategy is proposed. This approach, which we call the automatically matched layer (AML) implementation, is versatile and fully automatic for the end‐user. With the AML approach, the mesh of the layer is extruded, the required geometric parameters are automatically obtained during the extrusion step, and the practical implementation relies on a simple modification of the Jacobian matrix in the element‐wise integrals. The AML implementation is validated and compared to other implementation strategies using numerical benchmarks in two and three dimensions, considering computational domains with regular and non‐regular boundaries. A three‐dimensional application with a generally‐shaped domain generated using a convex hull is proposed to illustrate the interest of the AML approach for realistic industrial cases.","authors":["Hadrien Beriot","Axel Modave"],"meta":["March 2021International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 122(05):1239-1261","DOI:10.1002/nme.6560"],"references":["349078101_Stable_Perfectly_Matched_Layers_with_Lorentz_transformation_for_the_convected_Helmholtz_equation","333906955_Enhanced_Conformal_Perfectly_Matched_Layers_for_Bernstein-Bezier_Finite_Element_Modelling_of_Short_Wave_Scattering","325901520_Parallel_Ellipsoidal_Perfectly_Matched_Layers_for_Acoustic_Helmholtz_Problems_on_Exterior_Domains","321879269_Parallel_Ellipsoidal_Perfectly_Matched_Layers_for_Acoustic_Helmholtz_Problems_on_Exterior_Domains","336834880_Corner_treatments_for_high-order_local_absorbing_boundary_conditions_in_high-frequency_acoustic_scattering","328007470_Direct_implementation_of_high_order_BGT_artificial_boundary_conditions","320251014_Anisotropic_Locally-Conformal_Perfectly_Matched_Layer_for_Higher_Order_Curvilinear_Finite-Element_Modeling","313755817_A_new_finite_element_realization_of_the_perfectly_matched_layer_method_for_Helmholtz_scattering_problems_on_polygonal_domains_in_two_dimensions","312558136_Perfectly_matched_layers_for_convex_truncated_domains_with_discontinuous_Galerkin_time_domain_simulations","303337092_Absorbing_boundary_conditions_for_the_numerical_simulation_of_waves"]}
