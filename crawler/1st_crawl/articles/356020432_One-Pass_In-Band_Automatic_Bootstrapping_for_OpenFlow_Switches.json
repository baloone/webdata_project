{"id":"356020432_One-Pass_In-Band_Automatic_Bootstrapping_for_OpenFlow_Switches","abstract":"An SDN switch newly added to a network needs to establish a control channel with an SDN controller to manage control-plane traffic. The setup of such a channel is termed bootstrapping. In the case of in-band control, bootstrapping involves setting up a control path that may traverse one or more switches between the new switch and the controller, which is achieved through the configuration of layer-two to layer-four parameters on relevant switches. Previous approaches either result in lengthy bootstrapping time due to their level- by-level mechanisms, demand complicated modules, or lack some essential features. This paper proposes an approach to fast automatic bootstrapping that overlaps the bootstrapping processes among a set of switches. Our emulations using virtual switches completed the process of bootstrapping 50 switches arranged in a chain in 2.0 seconds, which is a 98% time reduction compared with a prior study.","authors":["Chien-Yung Li","Li-Hsing Yen","Kuang-Hui Chi","Chien-Chao Tseng"],"meta":["November 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125716"],"references":["350860452_ROCA_Auto-resolving_overlapping_and_conflicts_in_Access_Control_List_policies_for_Software_Defined_Networking","335416253_Amaru_Plugplay_resilient_in-band_control_for_SDN","331147550_eTDP_Enhanced_Topology_Discovery_Protocol_for_Software-Defined_Networks","323701495_Fast_Control_Channel_Recovery_for_Resilient_In-band_OpenFlow_Networks","352264241_rXstp_A_Topology_Discovery_Mechanism_Based_on_Rapid_Spanning_Tree_for_SDN_In-Band_Control","331725957_An_Improved_Mechanism_for_Flow_Rule_Installation_in_In-band_SDN","329547674_Address_resolution_protocol_spoofing_attacks_and_security_approaches_A_survey","326218387_On_Bootstrapping_In-Band_Control_Channels_in_Software_Defined_Networks","318476240_A_Self-Organizing_Distributed_and_In-Band_SDN_Control_Plane","317421286_Self-configuring_deterministic_network_with_in-band_configuration_channel","261489665_Automatic_bootstrapping_of_OpenFlow_networks","301446626_Auto-Configuration_of_SDN_Switches_in_SDNNon-SDN_Hybrid_Network","270764532_All-Path_Bridging_Path_Exploration_Protocols_for_Data_Center_and_Campus_Networks"]}
