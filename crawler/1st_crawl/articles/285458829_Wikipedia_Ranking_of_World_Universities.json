{"id":"285458829_Wikipedia_Ranking_of_World_Universities","abstract":"We use the directed networks between articles of 24 Wikipedia language\neditions for producing the Wikipedia Ranking of World Universities (WRWU) using\nPageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. This approach allows to incorporate\nvarious cultural views on world universities using the mathematical statistical\nanalysis independent of cultural preferences. The Wikipedia ranking of top 100\nuniversities provides about 60 percent overlap with the Shanghai university\nranking demonstrating the reliable features of this approach. At the same time\nWRWU incorporates all knowledge accumulated at 24 Wikipedia editions giving\nstronger highlights for historically important universities leading to a\ndifferent estimation of efficiency of world countries in university education.\nThe historical development of university ranking is analyzed during ten\ncenturies of their history.","authors":["Jos√© Lages","Antoine Patt","Dima L.
