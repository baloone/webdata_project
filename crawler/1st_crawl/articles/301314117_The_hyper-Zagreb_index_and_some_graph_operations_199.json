{"id":"301314117_The_hyper-Zagreb_index_and_some_graph_operations_199","abstract":"Let G be a simple connected graph. The Hyper-Zagreb index is defined as (Formula presented.). In this paper some exact expressions for the hyper-Zagreb index of graph operations containing cartesian product and join of n graphs, splice, link and chain of graphs will be presented. We also apply these results to some graphs to chemical and general interest, such as (Formula presented.) nanotube, rectangular grid, prism, complete n-partite graph.
