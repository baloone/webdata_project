{"id":"242980779_Unified_and_extended_form_of_three_types_of_splines","abstract":"The three types refer to polynomial, trigonometric and hyperbolic splines. In this paper, we unify and extend them by a new kind of spline (UE-spline for short) defined over the space {cosωt,sinωt,1,t,…,tl,…}, where l is an arbitrary nonnegative integer. ω is a frequency sequence {ωi=αi}-∞+∞,αi∈R. Existing splines, such as usual polynomial B-splines, CB-splines, HB-splines, NUAT splines, AH splines, FB-splines and the third form FB-splines etc., are all special cases of UE-splines. UE-splines inherit most properties of usual polynomial B-splines and enjoy some other advantageous properties for modelling. They can exactly represent classical conics, the catenary, the helix, and even the eight curve, a kind of snake-like curves etc.","authors":["Guozhao Wang","Mei-e Fang"],"meta":["July 2008Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 216(2):498-508","DOI:10.1016/j.cam.2007.05.031"],"references":["268493830_On_trigonometric_spline_interpolation","257014155_A_basis_of_C-Bezier_splines_with_optimal_properties","243788140_Construction_of_Exponential_Tension_B-splines_of_Arbitrary_Order","229288661_Corner_cutting_algorithms_associated_with_optimal_shape_preserving_representations","226930548_Fitting_scattered_data_on_spherelike_surfaces_using_tensor_products_of_trigonometric_and_polynomial_splines","225622780_Identities_for_Trigonometric_B-splines_with_an_application_to_curve_design","225564993_Two_kinds_of_B-basis_of_the_algebraic_hyperbolic_space","223258618_Two_different_forms_of_C-B-spline","222955393_Shape_preserving_alternatives_to_the_rational_Bezier_model","222878530_Multivariate_trigonometric_B-splines"]}
