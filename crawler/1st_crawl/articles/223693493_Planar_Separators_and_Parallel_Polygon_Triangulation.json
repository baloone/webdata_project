{"id":"223693493_Planar_Separators_and_Parallel_Polygon_Triangulation","abstract":"We show how to construct an O(√n)-separator decomposition of a planar graph G in O(n) time. Such a decomposition defines a binary tree, where each node corresponds to a subgraph of G and stores an O(√n)-separator of that subgraph. We also show how to construct an O(nϵ)-way decomposition tree in parallel in O(log n) time so that each node corresponds to a subgraph of G and stores an O(n12+ϵ)-separator of that subgraph. We demonstrate the utility of such a separator decomposition by showing how it can be used in the design of a parallel algorithm for triangulating a simple polygon deterministically in O(log n) time using O(n/log n) processors on a CRCW PRAM.","authors":["Michael T.
