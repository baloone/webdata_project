{"id":"311852328_Model_reduction_for_hybrid_systems_with_state-dependent_jumps","abstract":"In this paper we present a model reduction technique based on moment matching for a class of hybrid systems with state-dependent jumps. The problem of characterizing the steady-state for this class of systems is studied and a result which allows to describe the steady-state response of hybrid systems through the use of a hybrid mapping is given. A family of parameterized hybrid reduced order models which achieve moment matching. The special case of periodic input signals is analyzed and conditions for applying the technique are given for this class. A numerical simulation illustrates the results.","authors":["Giordano Scarciotti","Alessandro Astolfi"],"meta":["December 2016IFAC-PapersOnLine 49(18):850-855","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.10.272"],"references":["291388032_Moment-Based_Discontinuous_Phasor_Transform_and_its_Application_to_the_Steady-State_Analysis_of_Inverters_and_Wireless_Power_Transfer_Systems","238655546_Balanced_Model_Reduction_via_the_Proper_Orthogonal_Decomposition","224347259_l_2-l_infty_Model_Reduction_for_Switched_LPV_Systems_With_Average_Dwell_Time","221044462_Hybrid_system_reduction","220665961_Generalised_gramian_framework_for_modelcontroller_order_reduction_of_switched_systems","51927386_Dimension_Reduction_Near_Periodic_Orbits_of_Hybrid_Systems","41449259_Switched_Systems_Reduction_Framework_Based_on_Convex_Combination_of_Generalized_Gramians","324692396_Uniform_output_regulation_of_nonlinear_systems_A_convergent_dynamics_approach","314816065_Balanced_model_reduction_via_the_proper_orthogonal_decomposition","312890514_Basic_problems_on_stability_and_design_of_switched_systems","308859622_Model_reduction_by_moment_matching_at_discontinuous_signals_via_hybrid_output_regulation","283601639_Weighted_H1_model_reduction_for_linear_switched_systems_with_timevarying_delay","283480641_Hybrid_Output_Regulation_for_Linear_Systems_With_Periodic_Jumps_Solvability_Conditions_Structural_Implications_and_Semi-Classical_Solutions","282921752_Characterization_of_the_moments_of_a_linear_system_driven_by_explicit_signal_generators","282897166_Model_Reduction_by_Matching_the_Steady-State_Response_of_Explicit_Signal_Generators","281125369_Communications_and_Control_Engineering","268308926_Nonsmooth_mechanics_Models_dynamics_and_control_2nd_ed","265669468_Systems_with_impulse_effect_stability_theory_and_applications","262347996_Book_review_Qualitative_theory_of_hybrid_dynamical_systems","260662071_Internal_Model_Principle_for_Linear_Systems_With_Periodic_State_Jumps","254911406_Uniform_Output_Regulation_of_Nonlinear_Systems_A_Convergent_Dynamics_Approach","248115046_Topics_in_Nonsmooth_Mechanics","247534112_Synchronous_Rhythmic_Flashing_of_Fireflies","246352004_H1_model_reduction_of_markovian_jump_linear_systems","245262999_All_Optimal_Hankel-Norm_Approximations_of_Linear_Multivariable_Systems_and_Their_L-Error_Bounds","243786519_Approximation_of_Large-Scale_Dynamical_Systems","237132073_Synchronization_A_Universal_Concept_In_Nonlinear_Sciences","228939269_Reduction_of_Affine_Systems_on_Polytopes","228532334_Steady-state_behaviors_in_nonlinear_systems_with_an_application_to_robust_disturbance_rejection","225075595_Basic_problem_in_stability_and_design_of_switched_systems","224397480_Hybrid_Dynamical_Systems","224126875_Model_Reduction_by_Moment_Matching_for_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Systems","223875922_Model_simplification_for_switched_hybrid_systems","223215791_H_Model_reduction_for_uncertain_switched_linear_discrete-time_systems","223209958_Brief_paper_Weighted_H_model_reduction_for_linear_switched_systems_with_time-varying_delay","223122109_On_the_solution_of_the_minimal_rational_interpolation_problem","222406853_Balanced_Realizations_Near_Stable_Invariant_Manifolds","222051152_H_model_reduction_of_Markovian_jump_linear_systems_Syst_Control_Lett_502_103-118","20097674_Synchronous_Rhythmic_Flashing_of_Fireflies_II","3677441_The_theory_of_hybrid_automata","3206630_Morse_A_Basic_problems_in_stability_and_design_of_switched_systems_IEEE_Control_Systems_Magazine_195_59-70","3028990_Principal_Component_Analysis_in_Linear_Systems_Controllability_Observability_and_Model_Reduction","3023893_Minimality_and_local_state_decompositions_of_a_nonlinear_state_space_realization_using_energy_functions","2334269_The_Theory_of_Hybrid_Automata"]}
