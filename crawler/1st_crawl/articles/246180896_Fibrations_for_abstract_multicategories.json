{"id":"246180896_Fibrations_for_abstract_multicategories","abstract":"Building upon the theory of 2-dimensional fibrations and that of (abstract) multicategories, we present the basics of a theory of fibred multicategories. We show their intrinsic role in the general theory: a multicategory is representable precisely when it is covariantly fibrant over the terminal one. Furthermore, such fibred structures allow for a treatment of algebras for operads in the internal category setting. We obtain thus a conceptual proof of the ‘slices of categories of algebras are categories of algebras’ property, which is instrumental in setting up Baez-Dolan’s opetopes.","authors":["Claudio Hermida"],"meta":["July 2004","DOI:10.1090/fic/043/11"],"references":["265771045_Monoidal_Bicategories_and_Hopf_Algebroids","256205735_Yoneda_structures_on_2-categories","242981784_Connected_components_and_colimits","222670868_Representable_Multicategories","222504244_Some_properties_of_Fib_as_a_fibred_2-category","2690489_Operads_Algebras_Modules_And_Motives","2434025_The_Convergence_Approach_to_Exponentiable_Maps","2379155_From_Coherent_Structures_to_Universal_Properties"]}
