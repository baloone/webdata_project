{"id":"349639249_Multilayer-HySEA_model_validation_for_landslide-generated_tsunamis_-_Part_2_Granular_slides","abstract":"The final aim of the present work is to propose a NTHMP-benchmarked numerical tool for landslide-generated tsunami hazard assessment. To achieve this, the novel Multilayer-HySEA model is validated using laboratory experiment data for landslide-generated tsunamis. In particular, this second part of the work deals with granular slides, while the first part, in a companion paper, considers rigid slides. The experimental data used have been proposed by the US National Tsunami Hazard and Mitigation Program (NTHMP) and were established for the NTHMP Landslide Benchmark Workshop, held in January 2017 at Galveston (Texas). Three of the seven benchmark problems proposed in that workshop dealt with tsunamis generated by rigid slides and are collected in the companion paper (Macías et al., 2021). Another three benchmarks considered tsunamis generated by granular slides. They are the subject of the present study. The seventh benchmark problem proposed the field case of Port Valdez, Alaska, 1964 and can be found in Macías et al. (2017). In order to reproduce the laboratory experiments dealing with granular slides, two models need to be coupled: one for the granular slide and a second one for the water dynamics. The coupled model used consists of a new and efficient hybrid finite-volume–finite-difference implementation on GPU architectures of a non-hydrostatic multilayer model coupled with a Savage–Hutter model. To introduce the multilayer model more fluidly, we first present the equations of the one-layer model, Landslide-HySEA, with both strong and weak couplings between the fluid layer and the granular slide. Then, a brief description of the multilayer model equations and the numerical scheme used is included. The dispersive properties of the multilayer model can be found in the companion paper. Then, results for the three NTHMP benchmark problems dealing with tsunamis generated by granular slides are presented with a description of each benchmark problem.","authors":["Jorge Macías","Cipriano Escalante Sánchez","Manuel J.
