{"id":"326262436_Iris_and_Palmprint_Decision_Fusion_to_Enhance_Human_Recognition","abstract":"Multimodal biometric systems are more promised and accurate than unimodal ones. Beside increase the performance, the multimodal system minimize the universality problem. The current research introduces a new iris and palm fusion system. The feature of palm print is extracted using connectivity points and lifelines orientations, while features of iris is extracted using wavelet transform. The classification method was the distance classifier. The score level fusion is applied using modified version of majority voter. The system accuracy was 97.29% for palm, 71.97% and 98.54% for fusion.","authors":["Ali Mayya","Mariam Saii","Phd"],"meta":["September 2017","Project: PhD Project"],"references":["326262432_Iris_recognition_based_on_weighting_selection_and_fusion_fuzzy_model_of_iris_features_to_improve_recognition_rate","303696808_Face_Iris_And_Fingerprint_Multimodal_Identification_System_Based_On_Local_Binary_Pattern_with_Variance_Histogram_and_Combined_Learning_Vector_Quantization","326077194_Score_Level_Fusion_of_Multispectral_Palmprint_with_Triangular_Conorm","301406926_Bimodal_biometric_identification_with_Palmprint_and_Iris_traits_using_fractional_coefficients_of_Walsh_Haar_and_Kekre_transforms","268184568_Iris_pattern_recognition_using_complex_wavelet_and_wavelet_packet_transform","220359304_Fpcode_an_Efficient_Approach_for_Multi-Modal_Biometrics","3970075_Learning_User-Specific_Parameters_In_A_Multibiometric_System"]}
