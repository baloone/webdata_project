{"id":"278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","abstract":"In this paper, we study Z(2)Z(4)-additive cyclic codes. These codes are identified as Z(4)[x]-submodules of the ring R-r,R-s = Z(2)[x]/< x(r) - 1 > x Z(4) [x]/< x(s)-1 >. The algebraic structure of this family of codes is studied and a set of generator polynomials for this family as a Z(4)[x]-submodule of the ring R-r,R-s is determined. We show that the duals of Z(2)Z(4)-additive cyclic codes are also cyclic. We also present an infinite family of Maximum Distance separable with respect to the singleton bound codes. Finally, we obtain a number of binary linear codes with optimal parameters from the Z(2)Z(4)-additive cyclic codes.","authors":["Taher Abualrub","Irfan Siap","Nuh Aydin"],"meta":["March 2014IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60(3):1508-1514","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2014.2299791"],"references":["257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","226123780_Modular_and_p-adic_cyclic_codes","324335457_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","267657180_Z_2_Z_4_-additive_perfect_codes_in_steganography","267126485_Reversible_cyclic_codes_over_Z_4","257554814_Maximum_distance_separable_codes_over_mathbbZ_4_and_mathbbZ_2_times_mathbbZ_4","239752210_Book-Review_-_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","233932969_Bounds_on_the_size_of_linear_codes","220685203_Cyclic_codes_and_quadratic_residue_codes_over_Z"]}
