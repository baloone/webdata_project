{"id":"324097602_Quantum_speedup_in_solving_the_maximal-clique_problem","abstract":"The maximal-clique problem, to find the maximally sized clique in a given graph, is classically an NP-complete computational problem, which has potential applications ranging from electrical engineering, computational chemistry, and bioinformatics to social networks. Here we develop a quantum algorithm to solve the maximal-clique problem for any graph G with n vertices with quadratic speedup over its classical counterparts, where the time and spatial complexities are reduced to, respectively, O(2n) and O(n2). With respect to oracle-related quantum algorithms for the NP-complete problems, we identify our algorithm as optimal. To justify the feasibility of the proposed quantum algorithm, we successfully solve a typical clique problem for a graph G with two vertices and one edge by carrying out a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment involving four qubits.","authors":["Weng-Long Chang","Qi Yu","Zhaokai Li","Jiahui Chen"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.97.032344"],"references":["280630936_Realization_of_a_scalable_Shor_algorithm","264862759_Experimental_Implementation_of_Adiabatic_Passage_between_Different_Topological_Orders","260206066_Integrated_multimode_interferometers_with_arbitrary_designs_for_photonic_boson_sampling","233964580_Photonic_Boson_Sampling_in_a_Tunable_Circuit","233871377_Experimental_Boson_Sampling","263605648_Computer_and_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","239537898_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Combinatorial_Problems","233964576_Boson_Sampling_on_a_Photonic_Chip"]}
