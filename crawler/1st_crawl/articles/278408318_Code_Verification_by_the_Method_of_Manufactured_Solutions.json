{"id":"278408318_Code_Verification_by_the_Method_of_Manufactured_Solutions","abstract":"Verification of Calculations involves error estimation, whereas Verification of Codes involves error evaluation, from known benchmark solutions. The best benchmarks are exact analytical solutions with sufficiently complex solution structure; they need not be realistic since Verification is a purely mathematical exercise. The Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) provides a straightforward and quite general procedure for generating such solutions. For complex codes, the method utilizes Symbolic Manipulation, but here it is illustrated with simple examples. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, which are remarkably sensitive, MMS produces strong Code Verifications with a theorem-like quality and a clearly defined completion point.","authors":["Patrick J.
