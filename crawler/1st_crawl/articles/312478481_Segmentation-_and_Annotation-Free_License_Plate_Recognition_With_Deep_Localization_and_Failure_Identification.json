{"id":"312478481_Segmentation-_and_Annotation-Free_License_Plate_Recognition_With_Deep_Localization_and_Failure_Identification","abstract":"Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) is essential in several roadway imaging applications. For ALPR systems deployed in the United States, variation between jurisdictions on character width, spacing, and the existence of noise sources (e.g., heavy shadows, non-uniform illumination, various optical geometries, poor contrast, and so on) present in LP images makes it challenging for the recognition accuracy and scalability of ALPR systems. Font and plate-layout variation across jurisdictions further adds to the difficulty of proper character segmentation and increases the level of manual annotation required for training classifiers for each state, which can result in excessive operational overhead and cost. In this paper, we propose a new ALPR workflow that includes novel methods for segmentation- and annotation-free ALPR, as well as improved plate localization and automation for failure identification. Our proposed workflow begins with localizing the LP region in the captured image using a two-stage approach that first extracts a set of candidate regions using a weak sparse network of winnows classifier and then filters them using a strong convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier in the second stage. Images that fail a primary confidence test for plate localization are further classified to identify localization failures, such as LP not present, LP too bright, LP too dark, or no vehicle found. In the localized plate region, we perform segmentation and optical character recognition (OCR) jointly by using a probabilistic inference method based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) where the most likely code sequence is determined by applying the Viterbi algorithm. In order to reduce manual annotation required for training classifiers for OCR, we propose the use of either artificially generated synthetic LP images or character samples acquired by trained ALPR systems already operating in other sites. The performance gap due to differences between training and target domain distributions is minimized using an unsupervised domain adaptation. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methods on LP images captured in several US jurisdictions under realistic conditions.","authors":["Orhan Bulan","Vladimir Kozitsky","Palghat Ramesh","Matthew Shreve"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems PP(99):1-13","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2016.2639020"],"references":["314258175_A_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_to_Character_Segmentation_of_License_Plate_Images","302761554_Method_and_system_for_identifying_a_license_plate","263469479_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_to_Character_Level_Segmentation_of_License_Plate_Images","262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition","262098444_An_Iranian_License_Plate_Recognition_System_Based_on_Color_Features","260720555_License_Plate_Recognition_A_Brief_Tutorial","259930829_Subspace_Interpolation_via_Dictionary_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation","224358867_Graphical_Models_for_Joint_Segmentation_and_Recognition_of_License_Plate_Characters","224222599_An_Algorithm_for_License_Plate_Recognition_Applied_to_Intelligent_Transportation_System","221363223_A_similarity_measure_between_vector_sequences_with_application_to_handwritten_word_image_retrieval","221122968_Generative_Models_for_License_Plate_Recognition_by_using_a_Limited_Number_of_Training_Samples","220930438_Learning-Based_License_Plate_Detection_Using_Global_and_Local_Features","220929789_Efficient_Non-Maximum_Suppression","37683494_Classifier_training_based_on_synthetically_generated_samples","4180811_Unconstrained_licence_plate_and_text_localization_and_recognition","4026376_A_real_time_vehicle's_license_plate_recognition_system","3428145_License_Plate_Recognition_From_Still_Images_and_Video_Sequences_A_Survey","3427976_A_License_Plate-Recognition_Algorithm_for_Intelligent_Transportation_System_Applications","3427867_Automatic_License_Plate_Recognition","3156948_Efficient_Embedded_Neural-Network-Based_License_Plate_Recognition_System","3156842_License_Plate_Localization_and_Character_Segmentation_With_Feedback_Self-Learning_and_Hybrid_Binarization_Techniques","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","308819133_Towards_Annotation_Free_License_Plate_Recognition","283017461_USDOT_number_localization_and_recognition_from_vehicle_side-view_NIR_images","282822968_Chinese_License_Plate_Localization_in_Multi-Lane_with_Complex_Background_Based_on_Concomitant_Colors","264392873_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Rectangular_Shape_Detection","260665254_Automatic_License_Plate_Recognition_ALPR_A_State-of-the-Art_Review","258713373_Image_simulation_for_automatic_license_plate_recognition","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","254035782_A_vehicle_license_plate_recognition_system_based_on_analysis_of_maximally_stable_extremal_regions","235465083_Vertical-Edge-Based_Car-License-Plate_Detection_Method","225053829_Principal_Visual_Word_Discovery_for_Automatic_License_Plate_Detection","224711148_Face_Detection_using_Local_SMQT_Features_and_Split_up_Snow_Classifier","223791877_An_edge-based_color-aided_method_for_license_plate_detection","222523132_A_trainable_feature_extractor_for_handwritten_digit_recognition","220860556_Handwritten_Word_Image_Retrieval_with_Synthesized_Typed_Queries","4090645_Extraction_and_recognition_of_license_plates_of_motorcycles_and_vehicles_on_highways","4069301_New_approaches_for_license_plate_recognition_system","4067643_Color_analysis_for_Chinese_car_plate_recognition","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
