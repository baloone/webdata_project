{"id":"328347022_Investigation_into_Indexing_XML_Data_Techniques","abstract":"The rapid development of XML technology improves the WWW, since the XML data has many advantages and has become a common technology for transferring data cross the internet. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate and study the XML indexing techniques in terms of their structures. The main goal of this investigation is to identify the main limitations of these techniques and any other open issues. Furthermore, this research considers most common XML indexing techniques and performs a comparison between them. Subsequently, this work makes an argument to find out these limitations. To conclude, the main problem of all the XML indexing techniques is the trade-off between the size and the efficiency of the indexes. So, all the indexes become large in order to perform well, and none of them is suitable for all users' requirements. However, each one of these techniques has some advantages in somehow.","authors":["Alhadi Klaib","Joan Lu"],"meta":["January 2014","Conference: Int'l Conf.
