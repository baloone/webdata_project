{"id":"258047937_On_self-propulsion_of_N-sphere_micro-robot","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to describe the self-propulsion of a micro-robot (or\nmicro-swimmer) consisting of $N$ spheres moving along a fixed line. The spheres\nare linked to each other by arms with the lengths changing periodically. For\nthe derivation, we use the asymptotic procedure containing the two-timing\nmethod and a distinguished limit. We show that in the main approximation, the\nself-propulsion velocity appears as a linear combination of velocities of all\npossible triplets of spheres. Velocities and efficiencies of three-, four-, and\nfive-swimmers are calculated.\nThe paper is devoted to H.K.Moffatt, who initiated the author's interests in\nlow-Reynolds-number fluid dynamics.","authors":["V.
