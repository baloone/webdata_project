{"id":"339013197_Artificial_Intelligence-Enabled_Predictive_Insights_for_Ameliorating_Global_Malnutrition_A_Human-Centric_AI-Thinking_Approach","abstract":"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, malnutrition is one of the most serious but least-addressed development challenges in the world. Malnutrition refers to the malfunction or imbalance of nutrition, which could be influenced not only by under-nourishment, but also by over-nourishment. The significance of this paper is that it shows how artificial intelligence (AI) can be democratized to enable analysts who are not trained in computer science to also use human-centric explainable-AI to simulate the possible dynamics between malnutrition, health and population indicators in a dataset collected from 180 countries by the World Bank. This AI-based human-centric probabilistic reasoning approach can also be used as a cognitive scaffold to educe (draw out) AI-Thinking in analysts to ask further questions and gain deeper insights. In this study, a rudimentary beginner-friendly AI-based Bayesian predictive modeling approach was used to demonstrate how human-centric probabilistic reasoning could be utilized to analyze the dynamics of global malnutrition and optimize conditions for achieving the best-case scenario. Conditions of the worst-case “Black Swan” scenario were also simulated, and they could be used to inform stakeholders to prevent them from happening. Thus, the nutritional and health status of vulnerable populations could be ameliorated.","authors":["Mengleong How","Chan"],"meta":["February 2020AI 1(1):68-91","DOI:10.3390/ai1010004"],"references":["338550377_Artificial_Intelligence-Enhanced_Decision_Support_for_Informing_Global_Sustainable_Development_A_Human-Centric_AI-Thinking_Approach","337386315_Nutritional_Knowledge_and_Self-Reported_Nutritional_Practice_against_Malnutrition_among_Physicians_in_Jeddah_Saudi_Arabia","334812968_Future-Ready_Strategic_Oversight_of_Multiple_Artificial_Superintelligence-Enabled_Adaptive_Learning_Systems_via_Human-Centric_Explainable_AI-Empowered_Predictive_Optimizations_of_Educational_Outcomes","334812782_Comprehensive_Approaches_to_Improving_Nutrition_Future_Prospects","334488565_Educing_AI-Thinking_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_Arts_and_Mathematics_STEAM_Education","334243140_Management_of_Malnutrition_in_Older_Patients-Current_Approaches_Evidence_and_Open_Questions","333999095_Harnessing_Entropy_via_Predictive_Analytics_to_Optimize_Outcomes_in_the_Pedagogical_System_An_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Bayesian_Networks_Approach","333619245_An_Overview_on_Acute_Malnutrition_and_Food_Insecurity_among_Children_during_the_Conflict_in_Yemen","348618038_Complexity_and_Education_Inquiries_Into_Learning_Teaching_and_Research","334854121_The_Modeling_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_of_Early_Diagnosis_for_Malnutrition_with_Backpropagation_Method"]}
