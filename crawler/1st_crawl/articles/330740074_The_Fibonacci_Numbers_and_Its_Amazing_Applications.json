{"id":"330740074_The_Fibonacci_Numbers_and_Its_Amazing_Applications","abstract":"Fibonacci sequence of numbers and the associated \"Golden Ratio\" are manifested in nature and in certain works of art. We observe that many of the natural things follow the Fibonacci sequence. It appears in biological settings such as branching in trees, phyllotaxis (the arrangement of leaves on a stem), the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts etc. At present Fibonacci numbers plays very important role in coding theory. Fibonacci numbers in different forms are widely applied in constructing security coding.","authors":["Sudipta Sinha"],"meta":["January 2019","Project: Fibonacci Numbers in Nature"],"references":["290140831_Fibonacci_Based_Text_Hiding_Using_Image_Cryptography","249881798_Debussy_in_Proportion_A_Musical_Analysis","223117386_The_golden_section_in_the_measurement_theory"]}
