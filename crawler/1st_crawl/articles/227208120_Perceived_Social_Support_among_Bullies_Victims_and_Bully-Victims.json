{"id":"227208120_Perceived_Social_Support_among_Bullies_Victims_and_Bully-Victims","abstract":"Research indicates that social support plays a protective role among adolescents, but little research has explicitly evaluated\nits function among youth involved in bullying. Accordingly, this study examined relations among social support, bully/victim\nstatus, and psychological distress in a sample of 784 ethnically diverse youth. We assessed differences in perceived social\nsupport across bully/victim subtypes, and evaluated peer and maternal social support as protective factors among victims,\nbullies, and bully-victims. Youth were classified as uninvolved (61.6%), as bullies (14.3%), as victims (12.5%), and as bully-victims\n(11.6%). Uninvolved youth reported the most peer and maternal social support and the least anxiety/depression. Multivariate\nanalyses revealed that there was a significant interaction between bully/victim groups and peer social support. Specifically,\nbullies, victims, and bully-victims who reported moderate peer social support also indicated the least anxiety/depression.\nResults highlight the importance of encouraging youth to develop and effectively use peer support networks as part of bullying\nintervention programs.","authors":["Melissa Holt","Dorothy L Espelage"],"meta":["November 2007Journal of Youth and Adolescence 36(8):984-994","DOI:10.1007/s10964-006-9153-3"],"references":["345987317_Perceptions_of_the_Frequency_and_Importance_of_Social_Support_by_Students_Classified_as_Victims_Bullies_and_BullyVictims_in_an_Urban_Middle_School","345199437_State_Laws_and_Policies_to_Address_Bullying_in_Schools","313647646_Protective_factors_in_adolescent_problem_behavior_Moderator_effects_and_developmental_change","307981797_Bullying_and_Victimization_Prevalence_and_Relationship_to_Gender_Grade_Level_Ethnicity_Self-Esteem_and_Depression","289669334_School_bullies_victims_and_aggressive_victims_Factors_relating_to_group_affiliation_and_victimization_in_early_adolescence","281273960_An_Integrative_Theory_of_Intergroup_Conflict","279542257_State_Laws_and_Policies_to_Address_Bullying_in_Schools","278985519_Friendship_and_Friendship_Quality_in_Middle_Childhood_Links_With_Peer_Group_Acceptance_and_Feelings_of_Loneliness_and_Social_Dissatisfaction","271676167_Sexual_Abuse_History_and_Problems_in_Adolescence_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Moderating_Variables","270688526_Predicting_Problem_Behavior_and_Self-Esteem_Among_African_American_Adolescents"]}
