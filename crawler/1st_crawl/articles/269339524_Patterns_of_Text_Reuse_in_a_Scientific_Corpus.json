{"id":"269339524_Patterns_of_Text_Reuse_in_a_Scientific_Corpus","abstract":"We consider the incidence of text \"reuse\" by researchers, via a systematic\npairwise comparison of the text content of all articles deposited to arXiv.org\nfrom 1991--2012. We measure the global frequencies of three classes of text\nreuse, and measure how chronic text reuse is distributed among authors in the\ndataset. We infer a baseline for accepted practice, perhaps surprisingly\npermissive compared with other societal contexts, and a clearly delineated set\nof aberrant authors. We find a negative correlation between the amount of\nreused text in an article and its influence, as measured by subsequent\ncitations. Finally, we consider the distribution of countries of origin of\narticles containing large amounts of reused text.","authors":["Daniel Citron","Paul Ginsparg"],"meta":["December 2014Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112(1)","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1415135111","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259428370_Recycling_Texts_or_Stealing_Time_Plagiarism_Authorship_and_Credit_in_Science","245588504_Borrowing_Others'_Words_Text_Ownership_Memory_and_Plagiarism","221159542_Overview_of_the_2nd_International_Competition_on_Plagiarism_Detection","221102075_An_Evaluation_Framework_for_Plagiarism_Detection","2840981_Winnowing_Local_Algorithms_for_Document_Fingerprinting","329959710_Building_Successful_Online_Communities_Evidence-Based_Social_Design","257350312_Who's_Afraid_of_Peer_Review","243391893_Experimenting_with_Plagiarism_Detection_on_the_Arxiv","230857539_Publication_misconduct_and_plagiarism_retractions_A_systematic_retrospective_study","51563242_arXiv_at_20","45102293_Journals_step_up_plagiarism_policing","9021985_Preprint_server_seeks_way_to_halt_plagiarists","6035753_Turkish_physicists_face_accusations_of_plagiarism","5634554_A_Tale_of_Two_Citations","2088494_Notes_on_Unfair_Papers_by_Mebarki_et_al_on_Quantum_Nonsymmetric_Gravity''","1960663_Plagiarism_Detection_in_arXiv"]}
