{"id":"276342954_Empirical_Study_of_Agile_Software_Development_Methodologies","abstract":"In today's software industry, technological prowess and ever-evolving customer requirements have led to more complex software demands. Agile based software development is increasingly being adopted by the software practitioners as it assures early software development and high quality software products. Also, it offers responsiveness to changes in user requirements, providing for their quick absorption during software development. In this paper, we elaborate the significance, benefits and increasing adoption of Agile methodologies in context of today's complex and evolving software demands. The main objective of this paper is to conduct an empirical study into the choice among the most popular Agile methodologies, Scrum, Extreme Programming and Kanban. Further, this paper provides for a comparative analysis among various agile software development methodologies. Our survey results reveal higher adoption of Scrum based development in present-day software industry as compared to Extreme Programming and Kanban methodologies.","authors":["Gurpreet Matharu","Anju Mishra","Harmeet Singh","Priyanka Upadhyay"],"meta":["February 2015ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes 40(1):1-6","DOI:10.1145/2693208.2693233"],"references":["289748348_Comparative_evaluation_of_XP_and_scrum_using_the_4d_analytical_tool_4-DAT","252038812_Survey_of_Agile_Tool_Usage_and_Needs","4279044_Usage_and_Perceptions_of_Agile_Software_Development_in_an_Industrial_Context_An_Exploratory_Study","3480656_Agile_methods_in_European_embedded_software_development_organisations_A_survey_on_the_actual_use_and_usefulness_of_Extreme_Programming_and_Scrum","255679392_Extreme_programming_in_practice","242609432_Software_engineering_with_java","235616665_State_of_Agile_Survey","220695301_The_Art_of_Agile_Development","2955158_Beck_K_Embracing_Change_with_Extreme_Programming_IEEE_Computer_3210_70-77"]}
