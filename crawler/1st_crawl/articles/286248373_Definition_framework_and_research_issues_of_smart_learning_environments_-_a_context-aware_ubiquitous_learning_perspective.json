{"id":"286248373_Definition_framework_and_research_issues_of_smart_learning_environments_-_a_context-aware_ubiquitous_learning_perspective","abstract":"The rapid progress of mobile, wireless communication and sensing technologies has enabled the development of context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) environments, which are able to detect the real-world learning status of students as well as the environmental contexts. Accordingly, appropriate information can be provided to individual students in the right place and at the right time. However, researchers have indicated that, to support students to learn in real-world contexts in smart ways, more factors need to be taken into account when designing and developing learning systems. In this paper, the definition and criteria of smart learning environments are presented from the perspective of context-aware ubiquitous learning. A framework is also presented to address the design and development considerations of smart learning environments to support both online and real-world learning activities. Moreover, some emerging technologies that might facilitate the development of smart learning environments as well as the features and criteria of smart learning are addressed. Finally, research issues related to smart learning are provided.","authors":["Gwo-Jen Hwang"],"meta":["November 2014Smart Learning Environments 1(1):4","DOI:10.1186/s40561-014-0004-5"],"references":["291342445_Mindtool-Assisted_In-Field_Learning_MAIL_An_Advanced_Ubiquitous_Learning_Project_in_Taiwan","280689068_Research_Trends_in_Technology-based_Learning_from_2000_to_2009_a_content_analysis_of_publications_in_selected_journals","279902711_Criteria_Strategies_and_Research_Issues_of_Context-Aware_Ubiquitous_Learning","279769597_An_Expert_System-based_Context-Aware_Ubiquitous_Learning_Approach_for_Conducting_Science_Learning_Activities","279764849_Development_of_an_Adaptive_Learning_System_with_Multiple_Perspectives_based_on_Students'_Learning_Styles_and_Cognitive_Styles","313753822_Statistical_methods_for_speech_recognition","304037762_Mindtools_Productivity_and_Learning","289090185_Modeling_of_Adaptive_Tutoring_Processes","284971556_Multimedia_learning_and_games","284813798_Investigation_of_the_relationships_between_media_characteristics_presence_flow_and_learning_effects_in_augmented_reality_based_learning"]}
