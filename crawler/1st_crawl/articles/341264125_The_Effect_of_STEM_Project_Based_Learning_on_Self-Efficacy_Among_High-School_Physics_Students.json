{"id":"341264125_The_Effect_of_STEM_Project_Based_Learning_on_Self-Efficacy_Among_High-School_Physics_Students","abstract":"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Project-Based Learning (PjBL) is increase effectiveness, create meaningful learning and influence student attitudes in future career pursuit. There are several studies in the literature reporting different aspects of STEM into a PjBL pedagogy. However, the effect of implementing STEM PjBL in terms of improving students’ skills in self-efficacy levels in physics mechanics at high school level has not been demonstrated as expected in the previous literature. This study followed a quasi-experimental research method. Bandura’s social cognitive theory is used to assess and compare the effect of STEM PjBL with conventional teaching method on students’ self-efficacy level in learning physics among over 100 high school students. The result illustrated that STEM PjBL improve students’ self-efficacy to solve physics problem. Also, the study proposes a guideline for future research.","authors":["Mohd Ali Samsudin","Mahboobeh Jamali","Ahmad Nurulazam","Nader Ale Ebrahim"],"meta":["January 2020SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3574024"],"references":["333132624_Physics_Achievement_in_STEM_PjBL_A_Gender_Study","331503500_Viewing_How_STEM_Project-Based_Learning_Influences_Students'_Science_Achievement_Through_the_Implementation_Lens_A_Latent_Growth_Modeling","326012707_SELF-EFFICACY_SCIENTIFIC_REASONING_AND_LEARNING_ACHIEVEMENT_IN_THE_STEM_PROJECT-BASED_LEARNING_LITERATURE","324978377_Major_trends_in_distance_education_research_a_combination_of_bibliometric_and_thematic_analyze","323383936_Self-Efficacy_Scientific_Reasoning_and_Learning_Achievement_in_the_STEM_Project-Based_Learning_Literature","317300724_Publication_Trends_in_Physics_Education_A_Bibliometric_study","305063165_STEM_country_comparisons_international_comparisons_of_science_technology_engineering_and_mathematics_STEM_education_Final_report","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","315906744_Korean_Students'_Attitudes_toward_STEM_Project-Based_Learning_and_Major_Selection","300000380_Major_trends_in_knowledge_management_research_a_bibliometric_study"]}
