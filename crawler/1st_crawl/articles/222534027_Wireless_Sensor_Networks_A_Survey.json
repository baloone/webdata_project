{"id":"222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","abstract":"This paper describes the concept of sensor networks which has been made viable by the convergence of micro-electro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics. First, the sensing tasks and the potential sensor networks applications are explored, and a review of factors influencing the design of sensor networks is provided. Then, the communication architecture for sensor networks is outlined, and the algorithms and protocols developed for each layer in the literature are explored. Open research issues for the realization of sensor networks are also discussed.","authors":["I.F. Akyildiz","Su WY","Y. Sankarasubramaniam","E.
