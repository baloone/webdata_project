{"id":"320883245_HIN2Vec_Explore_Meta-paths_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks_for_Representation_Learning","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning framework, namely HIN2Vec, for heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6% to 23.8% of $micro$-$f_1$ in multi-label node classification and 5% to 70.8% of $MAP$ in link prediction.","authors":["Tao-yang Fu","Wang-Chien Lee","Zhen Lei"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3132847.3132953","Conference: the 2017 ACM"],"references":["312550563_Heterogeneous_Information_Network_Embedding_for_Meta_Path_based_Proximity","299970490_Heterogeneous_Network_Embedding_via_Deep_Architectures","273471480_LINE_Large-scale_Information_Network_Embedding","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","224216007_Acoustic_Modeling_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks","222845920_Clustering_in_Weighted_Networks","221273605_Co-author_Relationship_Prediction_in_Heterogeneous_Bibliographic_Networks","319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","319770232_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","313455630_Large-Scale_Embedding_Learning_in_Heterogeneous_Event_Data","309573019_Meta-Path_Guided_Embedding_for_Similarity_Search_in_Large-Scale_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","305997704_node2vec_Scalable_Feature_Learning_for_Networks","290714298_Navigation_in_a_small_world","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","280695987_PTE_Predictive_Text_Embedding_through_Large-scale_Heterogeneous_Text_Networks","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","261136952_DeepWalk_Online_Learning_of_Social_Representations","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","229100231_On_the_Alias_Method_for_Generating_Random_Variables_from_a_Discrete_Distribution","225502505_An_alias_method_for_sampling_from_the_normal_distribution","221663833_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","221653777_Ranking-Based_Classification_of_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","220343614_Relational_Retrieval_Using_a_Combination_of_Path-Constrained_Random_Walks","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks"]}
