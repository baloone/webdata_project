{"id":"320619613_A_Survey_of_Model_Compression_and_Acceleration_for_Deep_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved dramatic accuracy improvements in many visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep convolutional neural network models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model compression and acceleration in deep CNNs without significantly decreasing the classification accuracy. During the past few years, tremendous progress has been made in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent advanced techniques for compacting and accelerating CNNs model developed. These techniques are roughly categorized into four schemes: parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank factorization, transfered/compact convolutional filters and knowledge distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and sharing will be described in detail at the beginning, and all the others will introduced. For methods of each scheme, we provide insightful analysis regarding the performance, related applications, advantages and drawbacks etc. Then we will go through a few very recent additional successful methods, for example, dynamic networks and stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrix, main datasets used for the evaluating the model performance and recent benchmarking efforts. Finally we conclude this paper, discuss remaining challenges and possible directions in this topic.","authors":["Yu Cheng","Duo Wang","Pan Zhou","Tao Zhang"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":["316513734_Loss-aware_Binarization_of_Deep_Networks","313712534_Soft_Weight-Sharing_for_Neural_Network_Compression","311430427_SqueezeDet_Unified_Small_Low_Power_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Real-Time_Object_Detection_for_Autonomous_Driving","311100814_Comparing_Biases_for_Minimal_Network_Construction_with_Back-Propagation","310610589_Learning_the_Number_of_Neurons_in_Deep_Networks","310441018_Fully-adaptive_Feature_Sharing_in_Multi-Task_Networks_with_Applications_in_Person_Attribute_Classification","310440699_S3Pool_Pooling_with_Stochastic_Spatial_Sampling","309572312_Doubly_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","307536925_Pruning_Filters_for_Efficient_ConvNets","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","303970238_Learning_to_learn_by_gradient_descent_by_gradient_descent","301879895_Multi-Bias_Non-linear_Activation_in_Deep_Neural_Networks","301854555_Group_Equivariant_Convolutional_Networks","301848151_Binarized_Neural_Networks_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Weights_and_Activations_Constrained_to_1_or_-1","301846323_Understanding_and_Improving_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_via_Concatenated_Rectified_Linear_Units","296684500_Deep_Dynamic_Neural_Networks_for_Multimodal_Gesture_Segmentation_and_Recognition","284219622_Net2Net_Accelerating_Learning_via_Knowledge_Transfer","282844341_Neural_Networks_with_Few_Multiplications","269935399_Speeding-up_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Using_Fine-tuned_CP-Decomposition","319770428_ACDC_A_Structured_Efficient_Linear_Layer","319770346_Deep_Fried_Convnets","319770334_Deep_Compression_Compressing_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Pruning_Trained_Quantization_and_Huffman_Coding","319770329_Dynamic_Capacity_Networks","319770258_Face_Model_Compression_by_Distilling_Knowledge_from_Neurons","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770146_Second_Order_Derivatives_for_Network_Pruning_Optimal_Brain_Surgeon","319770113_HyperNetworks","319770111_Improving_the_speed_of_neural_networks_on_CPUs","312619873_Outrageously_Large_Neural_Networks_The_Sparsely-Gated_Mixture-of-Experts_Layer","311612099_Paying_More_Attention_to_Attention_Improving_the_Performance_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_via_Attention_Transfer","311610318_Fast_Algorithms_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311610246_Fast_ConvNets_Using_Group-Wise_Brain_Damage","311609205_Quantized_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Mobile_Devices","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311458156_Towards_the_Limit_of_Network_Quantization","311430750_Deep_Pyramidal_Residual_Networks_with_Separated_Stochastic_Depth","311430286_Trained_Ternary_Quantization","308277829_Less_Is_More_Towards_Compact_CNNs","308277088_XNOR-Net_ImageNet_Classification_Using_Binary_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","306187229_Learning_Structured_Sparsity_in_Deep_Neural_Networks","304409314_An_Exploration_of_Parameter_Redundancy_in_Deep_Networks_with_Circulant_Projections","303840259_Deep_neural_networks_are_robust_to_weight_binarization_and_other_non-linear_distortions","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","294688997_Advances_in_neural_information_processing_systems_2","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284476399_Compression_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Fast_and_Low_Power_Mobile_Applications","284218991_Convolutional_neural_networks_with_low-rank_regularization","282692433_Structured_Transforms_for_Small-Footprint_Deep_Learning","278413550_Bayesian_Dark_Knowledge","273387909_Distilling_the_Knowledge_in_a_Neural_Network","269935397_FitNets_Hints_for_Thin_Deep_Nets","266225209_Large_Scale_Distributed_Deep_Networks","269935358_Striving_for_Simplicity_The_All_Convolutional_Net","269877085_Compressing_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_using_Vector_Quantization","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition"]}
