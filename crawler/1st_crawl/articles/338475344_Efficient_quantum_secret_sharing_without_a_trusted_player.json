{"id":"338475344_Efficient_quantum_secret_sharing_without_a_trusted_player","abstract":"Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a fundamental primitive in quantum cryptography. The complex and secure multiparty quantum protocols can be built using QSS. The existing QSS protocols are either (n, n) threshold 2-level or (t, n) threshold d-level with a trusted player, where n denotes the number of players and t denotes the threshold number of players. Here, we propose a secure d-level QSS protocol for sharing a secret, where t players can reconstruct the secret without a trusted player. This protocol is more secure, flexible, and practical as compared to the existing QSS protocols: (n, n) threshold 2-level and (t, n) threshold d-level with a trusted player. Further, it does not disclose any information about the secret to players. Its security analysis shows that the intercept-resend, intercept, entangle-measure, forgery, collision and collusion attacks are not possible in this protocol.","authors":["Kartick Sutradhar","Hari Om"],"meta":["January 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-019-2571-4"],"references":["334179057_Cryptanalysis_of_multiparty_quantum_digital_signatures","331500208_General_secret_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","328050284_Verifiable_threshold_quantum_secret_sharing_with_sequential_communication","322685183_Multi-dimensional_quantum_state_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","318682635_t_n_Threshold_d-Level_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","317319274_Security_of_a_kind_of_quantum_secret_sharing_with_entangled_states","345430645_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_scheme_with_flexible_number_of_evaluator_based_on_k_n-threshold_quantum_state_sharing","331616532_Controlled_Secure_Direct_Communication_Protocol_via_the_Three-qubit_Partially_Entangled_Set_of_States","330123307_Quantum_Network_Communication_With_a_Novel_Discrete-Time_Quantum_Walk","323510319_Comment_on_t_n_Threshold_d-level_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","312871656_t_n_Threshold_Quantum_State_Sharing_Scheme_Based_on_Linear_Equations_and_Unitary_Operation","305483590_Novel_Criteria_for_Deterministic_Remote_State_Preparation_via_the_Entangled_Six-Qubit_State","266098151_Errata_list_for_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","279164075_t_n_Threshold_quantum_secret_sharing_using_the_phase_shift_operation","257641917_Secret_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform"]}
