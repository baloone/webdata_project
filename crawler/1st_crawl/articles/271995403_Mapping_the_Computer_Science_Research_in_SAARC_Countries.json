{"id":"271995403_Mapping_the_Computer_Science_Research_in_SAARC_Countries","abstract":"This paper presents a scientometric and keyword-based analysis of research work done in the discipline of computer science (CS) in the SAARC region during the last 25 years. We have performed a detailed computational analysis of bibliometric and textual data for publications originating from the SAARC countries indexed in Scopus. Our analysis measures and presents findings on total CS research output of the SAARC countries, global share and rank, growth trends and impact, collaboration levels within and outside of SAARC countries, top-ranking institutions and individuals in the region, most preferred journals in the region, and a text-based research topic trend. The analytical results provide a useful mapping of CS research work in the SAARC region. The results are correlated with other demographic and economic indicators of the SAARC countries, and present inferences useful for determining funding patterns and policy formulation for scientific research in CS domain.","authors":["Ashraf Uddin","Vivek Kumar Singh"],"meta":["September 2014IETE Technical Review 31(4):287-296","DOI:10.1080/02564602.2014.947527"],"references":["266160151_Measuring_research_output_and_collaboration_in_South_Asian_countries","257663078_Analysis_of_publication_patterns_in_Korean_library_and_information_science_research","220364548_Mapping_of_Indian_computer_science_research_output_1999-2008","220364497_Scientometric_analysis_of_the_major_Iranian_medical_universitie","257663175_Physics_publication_productivity_in_South_African_universities","257663132_A_scientometric_assessment_of_research_output_in_nanoscience_and_nanotechnology_Pakistan_perspective","257663083_The_evaluation_of_Indian_cancer_research_1990-2010","242562619_The_Global_Information_Technology_Report","225759827_Scientific_research_competitiveness_of_world_universities_in_computer_science","220365007_Cross-national_preference_in_co-authorship_references_and_citations"]}
