{"id":"283761643_Integrating_Heterogeneous_Information_via_Flexible_Regularization_Framework_for_Recommendation","abstract":"Recently, there is a surge of social recommendation, which leverages social\nrelations among users to improve recommendation performance. However, in many\napplications, social relations are absent or very sparse. Meanwhile, the\nattribute information of users or items may be rich. It is a big challenge to\nexploit these attribute information for the improvement of recommendation\nperformance. In this paper, we organize objects and relations in recommendation\nsystem as a heterogeneous information network, and introduce meta path based\nsimilarity measure to evaluate the similarity of users or items. Furthermore, a\nmatrix factorization based dual regularization framework SimMF is proposed to\nflexibly integrate different types of information through adopting the\nsimilarity of users and items as regularization on latent factors of users and\nitems. Extensive experiments not only validate the effectiveness of SimMF but\nalso reveal some interesting findings. We find that attribute information of\nusers and items can significantly improve recommendation accuracy, and their\ncontribution seems more important than that of social relations. The\nexperiments also reveal that different regularization models have obviously\ndifferent impact on users and items.","authors":["Chuan Shi","Jian Liu","Fuzhen Zhuang","Philip S.
