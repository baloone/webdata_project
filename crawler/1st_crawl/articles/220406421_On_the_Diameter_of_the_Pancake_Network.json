{"id":"220406421_On_the_Diameter_of_the_Pancake_Network","abstract":"Then-dimensionalpancake network,Pn, has processors labeled with each of then! distinct permutations of lengthnand a connection between two processors when the label of one is obtained from the other by some prefix reversal. Each permutation is considered as a stack of different size pancakes. The well knownpancake problemconcerns the number,f(n), of prefix reversals required to sortnpancakes.We describe a (9/8)n+2 step sorting sequence for Gates and Papadimitriou's stack ofnpancakes, χn, used for establishing their lower bound, thus disproving the conjecture that (19/16)nsteps are required. Furthermore, we improve their lower bound by showingf(n)≥(15/14)n. In fact, we define for eachn≡0 (mod14) a stack of pancakes, ϕn, and show that (15/14)n≤f(ϕn)≤(8/7)n−1.We show that −In, the conjectured hardest stack of burnt pancakes, can be sorted in (3(n+1))/2 steps, for alln≡3 (mod4) andn≥23. If −Inis indeed hardest, this implies that both the “burnt” and “unburnt” pancake networks of dimensionnhave diameter at most (3(n+1))/2.Values off(n), forn≤11, were given previously. We note thatf(12)=14,f(13)=15, andf(19)≥22.","authors":["Mohammad Hossain Heydari","Ivan Hal Sudborough"],"meta":["October 1997Journal of Algorithms 25(1):67-94","DOI:10.1006/jagm.1997.0874","SourceDBLP"],"references":["280300030_E1030","242608512_Introduction_to_Parallel_Algorithms_and_Architectures_Arrays_Trees_Hypercubes","222437944_Bounds_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversal","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks"]}
