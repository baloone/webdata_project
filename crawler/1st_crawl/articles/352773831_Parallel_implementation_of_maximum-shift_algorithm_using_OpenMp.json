{"id":"352773831_Parallel_implementation_of_maximum-shift_algorithm_using_OpenMp","abstract":"String matching is considered as one of the center issues within the field of computer science, where there are numerous computer applications that supply the clients with string matching services. The increment within the number of databases which are created and protected in numerous computer gadgets had impacted researchers with the slant towards getting robust techniques in tending to this issue. In this study, the Maximum-Shift string matching algorithm is chosen to be executed with multi-core innovation through the utilization of OpenMP paradigm, in order to decrease the successive time, and increment the speedup and efficiency of the algorithm. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), protein and the English text datasets are utilized to test the parallel execution that influences the Maximum-Shift algorithm execution when utilized with multi-core environment. The results demonstrated that the execution is affected by the performance between the parallel and consecutive execution of Maximum-Shift algorithm by data type. The English text appeared ideal comes about within the parallel execution time as compared to other datasets, whereas the DNA database set appeared the most elevated comes about when compared to other data types in terms of speedup and efficiency capabilities.","authors":["Atheer Akram Abdulrazzaq","Qusay Shihab Hamad","Ahmed Majid Taha"],"meta":["June 2021Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 22(3):1529","DOI:10.11591/ijeecs.v22.i3.pp1529-1539"],"references":["332773245_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithms_Survey_Issues_and_Future_Research_Directions","330653748_The_Improved_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_the_Atheer_and_Berry-Ravindran_Algorithms","309277340_Parallel_Quick_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem_Using_OpenMP","306009407_A_Fast_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm_Using_Changing_Consecutive_Characters","287062415_Multi-pattern_string_matching_algorithms_comparison_for_intrusion_detection_system","283971854_Cache_Locality-Centric_Parallel_String_Matching_on_Many-Core_Accelerator_Chips","281863574_A_New_Efficient_Hybrid_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithm_and_Its_Applications","327076654_The_Enhanced_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_the_AbdulRazzaq_and_Berry-Ravindran_Algorithms","312416666_A_Fast_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem","305675054_Parallel_processing_techniques_for_high_performance_image_processing_applications","273684926_String_Matching_Algorithms_for_Intrusion_Detection_System_A_Survey_and_Taxonomy","257719594_Empirical_Modelling_of_Linear_Algebra_Shared-Memory_Routines","234032751_Performance_Study_of_Parallel_Hybrid_Multiple_Pattern_Matching_Algorithms_for_Biological_Sequences","226574739_A_Simple_Fast_Hybrid_Pattern-Matching_Algorithm","269272975_Maximum-shift_string_matching_algorithms"]}
