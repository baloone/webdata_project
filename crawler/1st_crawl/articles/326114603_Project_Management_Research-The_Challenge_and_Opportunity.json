{"id":"326114603_Project_Management_Research-The_Challenge_and_Opportunity","abstract":"Project management is one of the fastest growing disciplines in organizations today. However, ironically, the statistics of project success suggests that most projects still fail and many projects do not accomplish their business results. This presents possibly a unique opportunity for substantial improvement. In this paper the authors offer their perspective about the challenge that the project management research community is facing today. The authors propose several research directions that may evolve as central in the next few years in order to stimulate the discussion and debate about the future of the discipline. They first look at project management research from a problem-driven perspective and than offer three central views with which project management could be perceived: the strategic/business view, the operational/process view, and the team/leadership view. For each one the governing thought pattern, the theories, and the related disciplines are presented. Although these views are certainly not unique, they may provide an integrated perspective of the discipline and a possible trigger for further discussion that may help attract scholars from other more established academic disciplines and improve the status of project management research.","authors":["Aaron Shenhar","Dov Dvir"],"meta":["June 2007Project Management Journal 38(2):93-99","DOI:10.1177/875697280703800210"],"references":["279594183_Strategic_Project_LeadershipR_Toward_a_strategic_approach_to_project_management","265221374_The_Current_State_of_Project_Management_Research_Trends_Interpretations_and_Predictions","247645321_Third-Generation_New_Product_Processes","247055303_One_Size_Does_Not_Fit_All_Projects_Exploring_Classical_Contingency_Domains","243768027_Technological_Discontinuities_and_Dominant_Designs_A_Cyclical_Model_of_Technological_Change","242530015_Project_success_Definitions_and_measurement_techniques","236175751_Critical_Success_Factors_Across_the_Project_Life_Cycle","227447537_A_Structural_Approach_to_Assessing_Innovation_Construct_Development_of_Innovation_Locus_Type_and_Characteristics","227447528_On_Uncertainty_Ambiguity_and_Complexity_in_Project_Management","222928058_Toward_a_Typological_Theory_of_Project_Management","222402297_On_the_Nature_of_the_Project_as_a_Temporary_Organisation","222050288_Third_Generation_New_Product_Process","347493104_The_Saga_of_Sydney_Opera_House_The_Dramatic_Story_of_the_Design_and_Construction_of_the_Icon_of_Modern_Australia","312461605_The_Management_of_Innovation","297313597_Technological_innovation_product_development_and_entrepreneurship_in_Management_Science","285750394_Strategic_business_management_through_multiple_projects","285372209_Product_development_Past_research","283918348_Updating_the_Project_Management_Bodies_of_Knowledge","273609665_The_company_of_the_future","251377242_The_Wiley_Guide_to_Managing_Projects","247276906_Project_Management_Strategic_Design_and_Implementation","246921080_Reinventing_project_management_The_diamond_approach_to_successful_growth_and_innovation","240284328_The_Anatomy_of_Major_Projects","239410205_Science_objective_knowledge_and_the_theory_of_project_management","236175710_The_Management_of_Projects","228693091_Two_Decades_of_Research_and_Development_in_Transformational_Leadership","227690867_Strategic_Project_LeadershipR_Toward_a_strategic_approach_to_project_management","227616417_Ranking_the_Technology_Innovation_Management_Journals","227597404_How_Projects_Differ_And_What_to_Do_About_It","227447616_50th_Anniversary_Article_Technological_Innovation_Product_Development_and_Entrepreneurship_in_Management_Science","227447355_Developing_Products_on_Internet_Time_The_Anatomy_of_a_Flexible_Development_Process","215915655_Accelerating_Adaptive_Processes_Product_Innovation_In_The_Global_Computer_Industry","215915650_The_Art_of_Continuous_Change_Linking_Complexity_Theory_and_Time-Paced_Evolution_in_Relentlessly_Shifting_Organizations","200465466_Product_Development_Past_Research_Present_Findings_and_Future_Directions","34248890_Developing_and_sustaining_project_management_as_a_strategic_asset_microform_a_multiple_case_study_using_the_resource-based_view","32896104_Moving_from_Corporate_Strategy_to_Project_Strategy","31746703_The_Innovator's_Solution_Creating_and_Sustaining_Successful_Growth_CM_Christensen_ME_Raynor","10576313_Why_Hard-Nosed_Executives_Should_Care_About_Management_Theory","4928745_In_search_of_project_classification_A_non-universal_approach_to_project_success_factors","3076609_Managing_Technology-Based_Projects_in_Multinational_Environments"]}
