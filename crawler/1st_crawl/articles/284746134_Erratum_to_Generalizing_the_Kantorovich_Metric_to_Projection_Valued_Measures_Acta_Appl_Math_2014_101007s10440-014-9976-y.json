We generalize this well known result to projection valued measures. In\nparticular, given a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, consider the collection of\nprojection valued measures from $X$ into the projections on $\\mathcal{H}$. We\nshow that this collection can be made into complete metric space via a\ngeneralized Kantorovich metric. As an application, we use the Contraction\nMapping Theorem on this complete metric space of projection valued measures to\nprovide an alternative method for proving a fixed point result due to P.\nJorgensen. This fixed point, which is a projection valued measure, arises from\nan iterated function system on $X$, and is related to Cuntz algebras. We also\nshow that the space of positive operator valued measures from $X$ into the\npositive operators on $\\mathcal{H}$ can be made into a complete metric space,\nvia the same generalized Kantorovich metric.","authors":["Trubee Davison"],"meta":["December 2015Acta Applicandae Mathematicae 140(1):23-25","DOI:10.1007/s10440-015-0018-1"],"references":["233281311_On_Weakly_Hyperbolic_Iterated_Function_Systems","2122378_Use_of_operator_algebras_in_the_analysis_of_measures_from_wavelets_and_iterated_function_systems","2111012_Iterated_function_systems_representations_and_Hilbert_space","313611886_Fractals_and_self-similarity","251187902_A_geometrical_property_of_POV-measures_and_systems_of_covariance","243765747_A_Course_in_Functional_Analysis","239601715_Fractals_and_Self-Similarity","230595873_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","222511212_Measures_in_wavelet_decompositions","220435984_The_uncertainty_relation_for_joint_measurement_of_postion_and_momentum","2663537_Power_Domains_and_Iterated_Function_Systems"]}
