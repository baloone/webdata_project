{"id":"260375727_INSOS-Educational_system_for_teaching_intelligent_systems","abstract":"The basic features of a INSOS software system developed to support the teaching of Intelligent Systems and experiences gained in using it at the Singidunum University Computer Engineering Department, have been presented. The system has been used by students for the self-learning and the work in the laboratory. They have the possibility to test abstract algorithms that are explained in classes and to explore their visual simulation. Its purpose is to demonstrate the application of theoretical knowledge in practice. Students are using it not only to understand how certain algorithms function, but also to gain insight into how they can be applied in practice and how to choose the right algorithm.","authors":["Marko Marković","Ivana Kostić Kovačević","Olivera Nikolić","Boško Nikolić"],"meta":["January 2014Computer Applications in Engineering Education 23"],"references":[]}
