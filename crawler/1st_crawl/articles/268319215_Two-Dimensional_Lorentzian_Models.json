{"id":"268319215_Two-Dimensional_Lorentzian_Models","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to present rigorous mathematical formulations and results for Lorentzian models, introduced in physical papers. Lorentzian models represent two dimensional models, where instead of a two-dimensional lattice one considers an ensemble of triangulations of a cylinder, and natural probability measure (Gibbs family) on this ensemble. It appears that correlation functions of this model can be found explicitly. Such models can be considered as an example of a new approach to quantum gravity, based on the notion of a causal set. A causal set is a partially ordered set, thus having a causal structure, similar to Minkowski space. We consider subcritical, critical and supercritical cases. In the critical case the scaling limit of the light cone can be restored.","authors":["Malyshev Vadim","Anatoly Yambartsev","A. A.
