There are two experimental strategies for dealing with this problem. The first is to use forced choice procedures, like the common duo-trio or triangle tests, while the second is to use signal detection measures like dâ€², P(A) and the R-index. These strategies are explained and discussed. The relationship between the R-index and the other signal detection measures is explained. The relationship between R-index values obtained by rating and ranking is explored, as are the alternative computations of the R-index by ranking: Rjb and Rmat.","authors":["Michael O'Mahony"],"meta":["March 1992Journal of Sensory Studies 7(1):1 - 47","DOI:10.1111/j.1745-459X.1992.tb00519.x"],"references":["225490584_Tables_of_d'_for_variable_standard_discrimination_designs","285887582_The_distinction_between_discrimination_and_splitting_in_paired_testing","274222971_A_Primer_of_Signal_Detectin_Theory","264574577_Sensory_Difference_Tests","264574051_Measurement_of_Sensory_Differences","249481142_Sensory_Evaluation_of_Regina_Freestone_Peaches_Treated_with_Low_Doses_of_Gamma_Radiation","249481140_Initial_Sensory_Evaluation_of_Bing_Cherries_Treated_with_Low_Doses_of_GammaRadiation","249465306_Sensory_difference_testing_Ranking_R-Indices_are_greater_than_rating_R-Indices","240806487_Sensory_Detection_of_Off-Flavors_in_Milk_Incorporating_Short-Cut_Signal_Detection_Measures1","236409461_Computer-Intensive_Methods_in_Statistics","227916457_Expanded_Tables_for_Conversion_of_a_Proportion_of_Correct_Responses_Pc_to_the_Measure_of_Sensory_Difference_d'_for_the_Triangular_Method_and_the_3-Alternative_Forced_Choice_Procedure","227872319_Effectiveness_of_Sensory_Difference_Tests_Sequential_Sensitivity_Analysis_for_Liquid_Food_Stimuli","225733495_A_revised_table_for_M-alternative_forced_choice","223415742_A_Multivariate_Model_for_Discrimination_Methods","215606073_Signal_Detection_Theory_in_Psychophysics","40170011_Tables_of_d'_for_the_Triangular_method_and_3-AFC_signal_detection_procedure","30989102_A_Test_for_Homogeneity_of_the_Marginal_Distributions_in_a_Two-Way_Classification","24061088_Note_on_the_Sampling_Error_of_the_Difference_Between_Correlated_Proportions_or_Percentages","22638056_Salt_Taste_Adaptation_The_Psychophysical_Effects_of_Adapting_Solutions_and_Residual_Stimuli_from_Prior_Tastings_on_the_Taste_of_Sodium_Chloride","19647303_Form_of_Empirical_ROCs_in_Discrimination_and_Diagnostic_Tasks_Implications_for_Theory_and_Measurement_of_Performance","18600094_Purity_Effects_and_Distilled_Water_Taste","18485248_Salt_Taste_Sensitivity_A_Signal_Detection_Approach","17717650_Comparing_the_Classification_of_Subjects_by_Two_Independent_Judges","16531394_Relative_singularitymixedness_judgments_for_selected_taste_stimuli","5726214_A_Test_for_Symmetry_in_Contingency_Tables"]}
