{"id":"289600273_Mutual_influence_of_the_sliding_velocity_and_temperature_in_frictional_heating_of_the_thermally_nonlinear_disc_brake","abstract":"Transient temperature fields in sliding components of a disc brake at coupling of temperature-dependent coefficient of friction, thermophysical properties of materials, time-dependent contact pressure and a velocity were analysed using the finite element method (FEM). Simulation of a single braking process for a cast-iron disc (ChNMKh) and a pad made of FMC-11 at four values of the contact pressure was carried out. Dependencies of the coefficient of friction and thermophysical properties of materials were adopted from experimental data. The temperature fields, braking times, and braking distances were calculated and confronted with the cases at the constant coefficient of friction.","authors":["A.A. Yevtushenko","P.
