{"id":"329545691_Exploring_the_Antecedents_to_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy","abstract":"Computer programming is mandatory for all computer-related disciplines and many STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors. Data collected from 151 undergraduate computer science (CS) and information systems (IS) students enrolled in an introductory computer programming class reveal that grit and passion influence programming self-efficacy for male students. Only obsessive passion is the primary predictor of programming self-efficacy among female students. The paper discusses possible ramifications for teaching computer programming to undergraduate students.","authors":["Pruthikrai Mahatanankoon"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1145/3291280.3291791","Conference: the 10th International Conference"],"references":["347985383_Investigating_grit_and_its_relations_with_college_students'_self-regulated_learning_and_academic_achievement","277814167_The_psychology_of_passion_A_meta-analytical_review_of_a_decade_of_research_on_intrapersonal_outcomes","23996619_Development_and_validation_of_the_Short_Grit_Scale_GRIT-S","6290064_Grit_Perseverance_and_Passion_for_Long-Term_Goals","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","306418094_Harmonious_passion_and_its_relationship_with_teacher_well-being","304285885_Perceptions_of_non-CS_majors_in_intro_programming_The_rise_of_the_conversational_programmer","283707263_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_and_Their_Sources_in_Undergraduate_Computing_Disciplines_An_Examination_of_Gender_and_Persistence","275103840_Career_Commitment_of_Information_Technology_Professionals_The_Investment_Model_Perspective","220259891_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Development_of_a_Measure_and_Initial_Test","41038399_On_the_Development_of_Harmonious_and_Obsessive_Passion_The_Role_of_Autonomy_Support_Activity_Specialization_and_Identification_With_the_Activity","22308002_Self-Efficacy_-_Toward_A_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","9049555_Les_Passions_De_L'ame_On_Obsessive_and_Harmonious_Passion"]}
