{"id":"321665663_High_Dimensional_Expanders","abstract":"Expander graphs have been, during the last five decades, the subject of a most fruitful interaction between pure mathematics and computer science, with influence and applications going both ways (cf. [Lub94], [HLW06], [Lub12] and the references therein). In the last decade, a theory of \"high dimensional expanders\" has begun to emerge. The goal of the current paper is to describe some paths of this new area of study.","authors":["Alexander Lubotzky"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["321511140_Finitary_approximations_of_groups_and_their_applications","321347758_Stability_cohomology_vanishing_and_non-approximable_groups","313845117_Random_walks_on_Ramanujan_complexes_and_digraphs","288713742_Vanishing_of_cohomology_with_coefficients_in_representations_on_Banach_spaces_of_groups_acting_on_Buildings","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313282479_Formules_de_Matsushima_de_Garland_et_propriete_T_pour_des_groupes_agissant_sur_des_espaces_symetriques_ou_des_immeubles","313178468_Groupes_reductifs_sur_un_corps_local_II","303901533_Bounded_degree_cosystolic_expanders_of_every_dimension","283933280_Riemann_Hypothesis_and_strongly_Ramanujan_complexes_from_GL","281607493_Eigenvalue_confinement_and_spectral_gap_for_random_simplicial_complexes"]}
