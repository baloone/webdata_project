{"id":"289300315_Making_Image_Retrieval_and_Classification_More_Accurate_Using_Time_Series_and_Learned_Constraints","abstract":"After the generation of multimedia data turning digital, an explosion of interest in their data storage, retrieval, and processing, has drastically increased in the database and data mining community. This includes videos, images, and handwriting, where we now have higher expectations in exploiting these data at hand. We argue however, that much of this work's narrow focus on efficiency and scalability has come at the cost of usability and effectiveness. Typical manipulations are in some forms of video/image processing, which require fairly large amounts for storage and are computationally intensive. In this work, we will demonstrate how these multimedia data can be reduced to a more compact form, that is, time series representation, while preserving the features of interest, and can then be efficiently exploited in Content-Based Image Retrieval. We also introduce a general framework that learns a distance measure with arbitrary constraints on the warping path of the Dynamic Time Warping calculation. We demonstrate utilities of our approach on both classification and query retrieval tasks for time series and other types of multimedia data including images, video frames, and handwriting archives. In addition, we show that incorporating this framework into the relevance feedback system, a query refinement can be used to further improve the precision/recall by a wide margin.","authors":["Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana","Eamonn Keogh","Vit Niennattrakul"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.4018/978-1-60566-174-2.ch007"],"references":["289942965_Genetic_time_warping_for_isolated_word_recognition","243785467_Fast_Time_Sequence_Indexing_for_Arbitrary_Lp_Norms","228943913_Clustering_visually_similar_images_to_improve_image_search_engines","228762351_Whole_of_Word_Recognition_Methods_for_Cursive_Script","225230134_Exact_indexing_of_dynamic_time_warping","221559958_FTW_Fast_similarity_search_under_the_time_warping_distance","221310976_LB_Keogh_Supports_Exact_Indexing_of_Shapes_under_Rotation_Invariance_with_Arbitrary_Representations_and_Distance_Measures","220907265_Making_Time-Series_Classification_More_Accurate_Using_Learned_Constraints","220907108_Three_Myths_about_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Data_Mining","14574745_Nonlinear_alignment_and_averaging_for_estimating_the_evoked_potential","11944869_Aligning_Gene_Expression_Time_Series_With_Time_Warping_Algorithms","4033332_Indexing_and_retrieval_of_on-line_handwritten_documents","3966300_Transcript_mapping_for_historic_handwritten_document_images","3943235_Discovering_similar_multidimensional_trajectories","3892934_An_index-based_approach_for_similarity_search_supporting_timewarping_in_large_sequence_databases","3810119_Image_browsing_using_hierarchical_clustering","3780764_Warped-average_template_technique_to_track_on_a_cycle-by-cycle_basis_the_cardiac_filling_phases_on_left_ventricular_volume","3297158_Haar_Wavelets_for_Efficient_Similarity_Search_of_Time-Series_With_and_Without_Time_Warping","2899418_Polyphonic_Audio_Matching_and_Alignment_for_Music_Retrieval","2862579_A_New_Approach_to_Analyzing_Gene_Expression_Time_Series_Data","2612270_Fast_Similarity_Search_in_the_Presence_of_Noise_Scaling_and_Translation_in_Time-Series_Databases","2611270_Rule_Discovery_From_Time_Series","245158226_Supervision_of_bioprocesses_using_a_dynamic_time_warping_algorithm","239567378_Manolopoulos_fast_subsequence_matching_in_time-series_databases","234813836_Design_considerations_for_a_Boolean_search_system_with_automatic_relevance_feedback_processing","234804810_Local_Feedback_in_Full-Text_Retrieval_Systems","228057995_Relevance_Feedback_in_Information_Retrieval","225198057_Kasetty_S_On_the_Need_for_Time_Series_Data_Mining_Benchmarks_A_Survey_and_Empirical_Demonstration_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_74_349-371","225172090_Comparing_Clustering_Methods_for_Database_Categorization_in_Image_Retrieval","221654270_Using_Dynamic_Time_Warping_to_Find_Patterns_in_Time_Series","221573902_Adaptive_nearest_neighbor_search_for_relevance_feedback_in_large_image_databases","221572685_Learning_image_similarities_and_categories_from_content_analysis_and_relevance_feedback","221265722_Color_Clustering_Techniques_for_Color-Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_from_Image_Databases","221215059_Query_by_Humming_-_in_Action_with_its_Technology_Revealed","221214364_Locally_Adaptive_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Indexing_Large_Time_Series_Databases","221093938_Applying_Boosting_to_Similarity_Literals_for_Time_Series_Classification","220907291_Iterative_Deepening_Dynamic_Time_Warping_for_Time_Series","220691539_Fundamentals_of_Speech_Recognition","220434644_Improving_retrieval_performance_by_relevance_feedback","12491027_Viskin_S_Cardiac_pacing_in_the_long_QT_syndrome_review_of_available_data_and_practical_recommendations_J_Cardiovasc_Electrophysiol_11_593-600","4024407_Efficient_subsequence_matching_for_sequences_databases_under_time_warping","3735032_Efficient_retrieval_of_similar_time_sequences_under_time_warping","3665896_Efficient_matching_and_clustering_of_video_shots","3176845_Performance_tradeoffs_in_dynamic_time_warping_algorithms_for_isolated_word_recognition","3176517_Memory_and_time_improvements_in_a_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_matching_speech_patterns","3176441_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_Optimization_for_Spoken_Word_Recognition","3176074_Minimum_Prediction_Residual_Principle_Applied_to_Speech_Recognition","2737899_Novelty_Detection_in_Time_Series_Data_using_Ideas_from_Immunology","2647335_Towards_3-D_model-based_tracking_and_recognition_of_human_movement_a_multi-view_approach","2588282_Exact_Indexing_of_Dynamic_Time_Warping","2555501_Warping_Indexes_with_Envelope_Transforms_for_Query_by_Humming","2475226_Learned_Models_for_Continuous_Planning","2548666_Scaling_up_Dynamic_Time_Warping_for_Datamining_Applications","2548217_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Fast_Similarity_Search_in_Large_Time_Series_Databases","2480442_Indexing_of_Handwritten_Historical_Documents_-_Recent_Progress"]}
