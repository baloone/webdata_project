{"id":"322180013_A_new_approach_based_on_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_data_allocation_problem","abstract":"The effectiveness distributed database systems highly depends on the state of site that its task is to allocate fragments. This allocation purpose is performed for obtaining the minimum execute time and transaction cost of queries. There are some NP-hard problems that Data Allocation Problem (DAP) is one of them and solving this problem by means of enumeration method can be computationally expensive. Recently heuristic algorithms have been used to achieve desirable solutions. Due to fewer control parameters, robustness, speed convergence characteristics and easy adaptation to the problem, this paper propose a novel method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm which is suitable to minimize the total transmission cost for both the each site – fragment dependency and the each inter – fragment dependency. The core of the study is to solve DAP by utilizing and adaptation PSO algorithm, PSO-DAP for short. Allocation of fragments to the site has been done with PSO algorithm and its performance has been evaluated on 20 different test problems and compared with the state-of-art algorithms. Experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that proposed method generates better quality solutions in terms of execution time and total cost than compared state-of-art algorithms.","authors":["Mostafa Mahi","Omer Kaan Baykan","Halife Kodaz"],"meta":["January 2018Applied Soft Computing 62:571-578","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2017.11.019"],"references":["289293572_Heuristic_Algorithms_for_Fragment_Allocation_in_a_Distributed_Database_System","262879155_A_New_Recombination_Operator_for_the_Genetic_Algorithm_Solution_of_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","260731684_A_Novel_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Solving_Static_Data_Allocation_Problem_in_Distributed_Database_Systems","220687592_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Allocating_Data_in_Distributed_Database_Systems","3755900_A_Modified_Particle_Swarm_Optimizer","296475529_Mathematical_Models_and_Empirical_Analysis_of_a_Simulated_Annealing_Approach_for_Two_Variants_of_the_Static_Data_Segment_Allocation_Problem","274783028_Hybrid_teaching-learning-based_optimization_algorithms_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","273400874_A_New_Hybrid_Method_Based_on_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Ant_Colony_Optimization_and_3-OPT_Algorithms_for_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","265645645_Distributed_Database_Design_using_Evolutionary_Algorithms","263371936_A_robust_Island_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","261498742_Data_Allocation_in_Scalable_Distributed_Database_Systems_Based_on_Time_Series_Forecasting","260349911_A_New_Data_Re-Allocation_Model_for_Distributed_DatabasSystems","260088798_A_robust_approach_for_multi-agent_natural_resource_allocation_based_on_stochastic_optimization_algorithms","258995279_A_recombination-based_hybridization_of_particle_swarm_optimization_and_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_continuous_optimization_problems","239279337_Implicit_Uncertainty_Propagation_for_Robust_Collaborative_Optimization","220511095_A_novel_parallel_hybrid_intelligence_optimization_algorithm_for_a_function_approximation_problem","220283888_A_Heuristic_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Solving_Resource_Allocation_Problems","42385717_Analysis_of_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm","26556536_Heuristic_Approach_to_Dynamic_Data_Allocation_in_Distributed_Database_Systems","4860054_Assignment_Problems_and_the_Location_of_Economic_Activity","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization"]}
