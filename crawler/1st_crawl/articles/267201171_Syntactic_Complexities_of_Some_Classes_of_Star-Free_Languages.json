{"id":"267201171_Syntactic_Complexities_of_Some_Classes_of_Star-Free_Languages","abstract":"The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardi-nality of its syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the maximal syntactic complexity of languages in that subclass, taken as a function of the state complexity n of these lan-guages. We study the syntactic complexity of three subclasses of star-free languages. We find tight upper bounds for languages accepted by mono-tonic, partially monotonic and \"nearly monotonic\" automata; all three of these classes are star-free. We conjecture that the bound for nearly monotonic languages is also a tight upper bound for star-free languages.","authors":["Janusz Brzozowski","Baiyu Li","David R Cheriton"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31623-4_9","Conference: International Workshop on Descriptional Complexity of Formal Systems"],"references":["226652130_On_Deterministic_Finite_Automata_and_Syntactic_Monoid_Size","31593969_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","283518703_Estimates_of_the_number_of_states_of_finite_automata","257144732_Synchronizing_generalized_monotonic_automata","243046276_Asymptotic_Results_for_Semigroups_of_Order-Preserving_Partial_Transformations","243029425_Products_of_idempotents_in_certain_semigroups_of_transformations","242552512_Finite_Automata_and_Representation_of_Events","229124581_Linear_Automaton_Transformations","226664305_On_the_ranks_of_certain_semigroups_of_order-preserving_transformations","225130243_State_Complexity_and_the_Monoid_of_Transformations_of_a_Finite_Set","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","221991686_A_new_proof_of_Cayley's_formula_for_counting_labeled_trees","221568135_Nondeterministic_State_Complexity_of_Star-Free_Languages","220520656_State_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","220180337_State_complexity_and_the_monoid_of_transformations_of_a_finite_set","220148412_On_deterministic_finite_automata_and_syntactic_monoid_size","50378581_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Prefix-_Suffix-_Bifix-_and_Factor-FreeRegular_Languages","48169995_Quotient_Complexity_of_Star-Free_Languages","47438215_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Ideal_and_Closed_Languages","41055007_Quotient_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","31595633_On_the_State_Complexity_of_Reversals_of_Regular_Languages"]}
