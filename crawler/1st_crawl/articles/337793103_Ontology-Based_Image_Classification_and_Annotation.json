{"id":"337793103_Ontology-Based_Image_Classification_and_Annotation","abstract":"With the rapid growth of image collections, image classification and annotation has been active areas of research with notable recent progress. Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, which relies on building visual vocabulary, has been widely used in this area. Recently, attention has been shifted to the use of advanced architectures which are characterized by multi-level processing. Hierarchical Max-Pooling (HMAX) model has attracted a great deal of attention in image classification. To improve image classification and annotation, several approaches based on ontologies have been proposed. However, image classification and annotation remain a challenging problem due to many related issues like the problem of ambiguity between classes. This problem can affect the quality of both classification and annotation results. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based image classification and annotation approach. Our contributions consist of the following: (1) exploiting ontological relationships between classes during both image classification and annotation processes; (2) combining the outputs of hypernymâ€“hyponym classifiers to lead to a better discrimination between classes; and (3) annotating images by combining hypernym and hyponym classification results in order to improve image annotation and to reduce the ambiguous and inconsistent annotations. The aim is to improve image classification and annotation by using ontologies. Several strategies have been experimented, and the obtained results have shown that our proposal improves image classification and annotation.","authors":["Jalila Filali","Hajer Baazaoui Zghal","Jean Martinet"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence 34(8)","DOI:10.1142/S0218001420400029","Projects: Data mining and multi-agent systemsPersonalized and context-aware retrieval based on fuzzy ontology profiling"],"references":["331783486_Ontology_and_HMAX_Features-based_Image_Classification_using_Merged_Classifiers","330635968_Research_on_a_Thangka_Image_Classification_Method_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machine","323063741_Weakly_Supervised_Image_Classification_with_Coarse_and_Fine_Labels","321120651_Visually_Supporting_Image_Annotation_Based_on_Visual_Features_and_Ontologies","320965337_WILDCAT_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Deep_ConvNets_for_Image_Classification_Pointwise_Localization_and_Segmentation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318551134_Deep_Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_Learning_for_Image_Annotation","317159482_Improving_Image_Classification_using_Coarse_and_Fine_Labels","312538118_Support-vector_networks","311610605_CNN-RNN_A_Unified_Framework_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification"]}
