{"id":"331508653_Bayesian_stopping_rule_in_discrete_parameter_space_with_multiple_local_maxima","abstract":"The paper presents the stopping rule for random search for Bayesian model-structure estima-tion by maximising the likelihood function. The inspected maximisation uses random restartsto cope with local maxima in discrete space. The stopping rule, suitable for any maximisationof this type, exploits the probability of finding global maximum implied by the number of localmaxima already found. It stops the search when this probability crosses a given threshold. Theinspected case represents an important example of the search in a huge space of hypotheses socommon in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer science.","authors":["Miroslav Karny"],"meta":["March 2019Kybernetika -Praha- 55(1):1-11","DOI:10.14736/kyb-2019-1-0001","Project: Rationality and Deliberation"],"references":["276937407_Structure_Determination_of_Regression-Type_Models_for_Adaptive_Prediction_and_Control","316805877_Springer_Series_in_Operations_Research_and_Financial_Engineering","281266055_No_Free_Lunch_Theorems_for_Optimization","270345244_Hybrid_dimension_reduction_by_integrating_feature_selection_with_feature_extraction_method_for_text_clustering","267440561_Information_and_Exponential_Families_In_Statistical_Theory","244456922_Bayesian_approach_to_system_identification","234778059_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization","230675253_Statistic_al_Decision_Theory_and_Bayesian_Analysis","44423356_An_Introduction_to_Bayesian_Inference_in_Economics","39765372_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching"]}
