{"id":"330527422_Managing_Collaborations_between_Medical_and_Engineering_Actors_in_Case_of_Prosthesis_Implantation_A_PLM-Based_Approach","abstract":"Medical sector is a dynamic domain that needs continuous improvement of its business processes. The purpose of this research focuses on the treatment process requiring prosthesis. This type of process requires knowledge reuse and data sharing for collaboration between various business stakeholders. Such treatment process makes connection between two separate lifecycles that belong to medical and engineering fields respectively. In this case, several problems of communication and collaboration already appear due to heterogeneity of semantics and business practices. In this perspective, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing the connection between disease lifecycle (Medical) and prosthesis lifecycle (Engineering). Based on this analysis, a combined KM-PLM based approach is proposed and implemented in AUDROS software solution to support the involved stakeholders by assistance functionalities along the treatment and prosthesis realization processes.","authors":["Thanh Nghi Ngo","Farouk Belkadi","Alain Bernard"],"meta":["January 2019Computer-Aided Design and Applications 16(5):1003-1019","DOI:10.14733/cadaps.2019.1003-1019"],"references":["323634883_Knowledge_management_framework_for_complaint_knowledge_transfer_to_product_development","319888289_The_Methods_of_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_the_Product_Lifecycle_for_a_Generative_Model's_Creation_Process","302407602_Product_Lifecycle_Management_Functional_Reference_Model_for_Software_Support","328870417_Electroencephalography_Basic_concepts_and_brain_applications","309693615_Collaboration_management_framework_for_OEM_-_suppliers_relationships_a_trust-based_conceptual_approach","300637570_Product_lifecycle_management_systems","292774431_Rapid_prototype_technique_in_medical_field","271838594_Medical_Modelling_The_Application_of_Advanced_Design_and_Rapid_Prototyping_Techniques_in_Medicine_Second_Edition","268251805_Advanced_algorithmic_approaches_to_medical_image_segmentation_State-of-the-art_applications_in_cardiology_neurology_mammography_and_pathology","266377642_Knowledge_evaluation_in_product_lifecycle_design_and_support","264814281_Product_lifecycle_management_-_From_its_history_to_its_new_role","256506236_Knowledge-based_assessment_of_manufacturing_process_performance_Integration_of_product_lifecycle_management_and_value-chain_simulation_approaches","239397705_Using_RP_to_promote_collaborative_design_of_customised_medical_implants","265213567_Cranial_reconstruction_3D_biomodel_and_custom-built_implant_created_using_additive_manufacturing","242011568_The_evolution_of_rapid_prototyping_in_dentistry_A_review"]}
