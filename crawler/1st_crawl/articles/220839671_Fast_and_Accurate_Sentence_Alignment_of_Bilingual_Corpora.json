{"id":"220839671_Fast_and_Accurate_Sentence_Alignment_of_Bilingual_Corpora","abstract":"We present a new method for aligning sentences with their translations in a parallel bilingual corpus. Previous approaches have generally been based ei- ther on sentence length or word correspondences. Sentence-length-based meth- ods are relatively fast and fairly accurate. Word-correspondence-based methods are generally more accurate but much slower, and usually depend on cognates or a bilingual lexicon. Our method adapts and combines these approaches, achiev- ing high accuracy at a modest computational cost, and requiring no knowledge of the languages or the corpus beyond division into words and sentences.","authors":["Robert C.
