{"id":"268508401_Fixed_point_results_for_a-ps-locally_graphic_contraction_in_dislocated_qusai_metric_spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we have obtianed fixed point results for α-ψ-locally contractive type mappings in a closed ball in left K-sequentially complete and in right K-sequentially complete dislocated quasi metric spaces. Moreover the mappings under consideration are α-admissible with respect to η. We have used conditions weaker than those of Samet et al. [B. Samet, C. Vetro, P. Vetro, Fixed point theorems for α-ψ-contractive type mappings, Nonlinear Anal. 75(2012), 2154-2165]. As an application, we have derived some new fixed point theorems for ψ-graphic contractions defined on dislocated quasi metric space endowed with a graph as well as ordered dislocated metric space. Some comparative examples are constructed which illustrate the superiority of our results. In the process we have generalized several well known, recent and classical results from the literature.","authors":["Arshad Muhammad","Fahim Uddin","Abdullah Shoaib","Aftab Hussain"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/s40096-014-0132-7","Project: Fixed points  results for multi and single valued mappings"],"references":["282493903_Functional_Analysis_in_Asymmetric_Normed_Spaces","279898992_Krasnosel'skii_and_Ky_Fan_type_fixed_point_theorems_in_ordered_Banach_spaces","279889462_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_partially_ordered_sets_and_some_application_to_matrix_equations","275973412_Common_fixed_points_of_a_pair_of_Hardy_Rogers_Type_Mappings_on_a_Closed_Ball_in_Ordered_Partial_Metric_Spaces","275536044_Fixed_points_results_of_dominated_mappings_on_a_closed_ball_in_ordered_partial_metric_spaces_without_continuity","275534473_Common_fixed_point_results_for_a-contractions_on_a_metric_space_endowed_with_graph","274855622_Fixed_point_of_a-ps-contractive_type_mappings_in_uniform_spaces","269922589_Best_Proximity_Point_for_a_-_ps_-Proximal_Contractive_Multimaps","267145115_Generalized_contractions_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces","267147616_Fixed_point_of_ph-contraction_in_metric_spaces_endowed_with_a_graph"]}
