{"id":"286195988_Usage_of_computer_mouse_characteristics_for_identification_in_web_browsing","abstract":"User behavioural characteristics such as mouse dynamics are present in the web browsing process. Identification of an unauthorized user based on user model containing mouse dynamics patterns might be useful for personalized system. This paper proposes a user modelling process specialized for user identification in browsing the web. We conducted our study in a running e-shop. The experiment is designed to track mouse dynamics characteristics and user's personality profile. We present the results of distinctiveness of individual characteristics among visitors and performance of the identification method.","authors":["Daniela Chuda","Peter Kr√°tky"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1145/2659532.2659645","Conference: the 15th International Conference"],"references":["260925814_A_behavioral_biometric_system_based_on_human-computer_interaction","221609904_An_Efficient_User_Verification_System_via_Mouse_Movements","221325920_User_re-authentication_via_mouse_movements","3308596_An_Introduction_to_Biometric_Recognition","220795669_Multifactor_authentication_based_on_keystroke_dynamics","220593712_User_Authentication_through_Keystroke_Dynamics","220423417_Identity_Authentication_Based_on_Keystroke_Latencies","21520772_An_Introduction_to_the_Five-Factor_Model_and_Its_Applications","3449422_A_New_Biometric_Technology_Based_on_Mouse_Dynamics","2455935_Authentication_via_Keystroke_Dynamics"]}
