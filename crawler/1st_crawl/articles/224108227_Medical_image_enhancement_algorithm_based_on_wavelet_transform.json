{"id":"224108227_Medical_image_enhancement_algorithm_based_on_wavelet_transform","abstract":"Low contrast and poor quality are main problems in the production of medical images. By using the wavelet transform and Haar transform, a novel image enhancement approach is proposed. First, a medical image was decomposed with wavelet transform. Secondly, all high-frequency sub-images were decomposed with Haar transform. Thirdly, noise in the frequency field was reduced by the soft-threshold method. Fourthly, high-frequency coefficients were enhanced by different weight values in different sub-images. Then, the enhanced image was obtained through the inverse wavelet transform and inverse Haar transform. Lastly, the image's histogram was stretched by nonlinear histogram equalisation. Experiments showed that this method can not only enhance an image's details but can also preserve its edge features effectively.","authors":["Y. Yang","Zhixun Su","L.
