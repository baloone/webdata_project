{"id":"226375710_Network_Regression_with_Predictive_Clustering_Trees","abstract":"Regression inference in network data is a challenging task in machine learning and data mining. Network data describe entities\nrepresented by nodes, which may be connected with (related to) each other by edges. Many network datasets are characterized\nby a form of autocorrelation where the values of the response variable at a given node depend on the values of the variables\n(predictor and response) at the nodes connected to the given node. This phenomenon is a direct violation of the assumption\nof independent (i.i.d.) observations: At the same time, it offers a unique opportunity to improve the performance of predictive\nmodels on network data, as inferences about one entity can be used to improve inferences about related entities. In this paper,\nwe propose a data mining method that explicitly considers autocorrelation when building regression models from network data.\nThe method is based on the concept of predictive clustering trees (PCTs), which can be used both for clustering and predictive\ntasks: PCTs are decision trees viewed as hierarchies of clusters and provide symbolic descriptions of the clusters. In addition,\nPCTs can be used for multi-objective prediction problems, including multi-target regression and multi-target classification.\nEmpirical results on real world problems of network regression show that the proposed extension of PCTs performs better than\ntraditional decision tree induction when autocorrelation is present in the data.","authors":["Daniela Stojanova","Michelangelo Ceci","Annalisa Appice","Sašo Džeroski"],"meta":["January 1970Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 25(2):333-348","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-23808-6_22","Conference: Proceedings of the 2011 European conference on Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases - Volume Part III"],"references":["238767143_A_Data_Mining_Approach_to_Predict_Forest_Fires_using_Meteorological_Data","235080010_Autocorrelation_and_Relational_Learning_Challenges_and_Opportunities","228537532_Support_Vector_Regression","225769490_A_Methodology_for_Mining_Document-Enriched_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","225691329_Global_and_Local_Spatial_Autocorrelation_in_Predictive_Clustering_Trees","221654550_Why_collective_inference_improves_relational_classification","221653482_Effective_label_acquisition_for_collective_classification","221612686_An_Iterative_Learning_Algorithm_for_Within-Network_Regression_in_the_Transductive_Setting","221603031_Improving_Learning_in_Networked_Data_by_Combining_Explicit_and_Mined_Links","221112677_RIONA_A_Classifier_Combining_Rule_Induction_and_k-NN_Method_with_Automated_Selection_of_Optimal_Neighbourhood","221103130_SLIQ_A_fast_scalable_classifier_for_data_mining","220605579_Collective_Classification_in_Network_Data_Articles","220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","220321024_Predicting_the_functions_of_proteins_in_Protein-Protein_Interaction_networks_from_global_information","220271961_Using_Ghost_Edges_for_Classification_in_Sparsely_Labeled_Networks","215992283_Classification_in_Networked_Data_A_Toolkit_and_a_Univariate_Case_Study","215991438_Relational_Dependency_Networks","200110721_Link_Prediction_using_Supervised_Learning","200110416_Improving_recommendation_lists_through_topic_diversification","200110353_Birds_of_a_Feather_Homophily_in_Social_Networks","33051395_Induction_of_model_trees_for_predicting_continuous_classes","2870006_A_New_Approach_to_Robust_Clustering_by_Density_Estimation_in_an_Autocorrelation_Derived_Feature_Space","261080350_A_clustering_algorithm_for_mobile_ad_hoc_networks_based_on_spatial_auto-correlation","260495889_Machine_learning_an_Artificial_Intelligence_approach_Volume_2","257130556_Using_relational_decision_trees_to_model_out-crossing_rates_in_a_multi-field_setting","250776324_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Attributes","245577667_Autoregressive_Conditional_Heteroscedasty_with_Estimates_of_the_Variance_of_the_United_Kingdom","240310918_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_CART","238655506_Autoregressive_Conditional_Heteroskedasticity_with_Estimates_of_the_Variance_of_United_Kingdom_Inflation","227670424_A_History_of_the_Concept_of_Spatial_Autocorrelation_A_Geographer's_Perspective","227635353_Beyond_Moran's_I_Testing_for_Spatial_Dependence_Based_on_the_Spatial_Autoregressive_Model","222664976_Spatial_and_space-time_correlations_in_ecological_models","222490388_The_computational_complexity_of_probabilistic_inference_using_Bayesian_belief_networks_research_note","222308464_Spatial_Autocorrelation_A_Primer","220765164_A_Shrinkage_Approach_for_Modeling_Non-stationary_Relational_Autocorrelation","216812577_Spatial_Autocorrelation_Trouble_or_New_Paradigm","215669578_Complex_Networks_as_a_Unified_Framework_for_Descriptive_Analysis_and_Predictive_Modeling_in_Climate_Science","214640678_What_Is_Twitter_a_Social_Network_or_a_News_Media","48264135_Marketing_Via_Friends_Strategic_Diffusion_of_Information_in_Social_Networks_with_Homophily","2919266_Combining_Active_Learning_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Using_Gaussian_Fields_and_Harmonic_Functions","2726078_Top-Down_Induction_of_Clustering_Trees"]}
