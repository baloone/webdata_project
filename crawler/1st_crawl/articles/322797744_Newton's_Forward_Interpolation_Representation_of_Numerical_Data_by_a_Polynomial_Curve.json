{"id":"322797744_Newton's_Forward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","abstract":"In order to reduce the numerical computations associated to the repeated application of the existing interpolation formula in computing a large number of interpolated values, a formula has been derived from Newtonâ€™s forward interpolation formula for representing the numerical data on a pair of variables by a polynomial curve. Application of the formula to numerical data has been shown in the case of representing the data on the total population of India corresponding as a function of time. The formula is suitable in the situation where the values of the argument (i.e. independent variable) are at equal interval.","authors":["Biswajit Das","Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["307867699_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","315232371_Recurrence_relations_for_computing_with_modified_divided_differences","265348352_The_Calculus_of_Finite_Differences","262358251_A_Remark_on_Divided_Differences","262348629_A_divided_difference_expansion_of_a_divided_difference","252185151_Optimal_Lebesgue_Constant_for_Lagrange_Interpolation","242966105_Some_results_on_numerical_divided_difference_formulas","227207554_On_a_characterization_of_polynomials_by_divided_differences","226150978_A_divided_difference_formula_for_the_error_in_Hermite_interpolation","223645379_On_the_divided_differences_of_the_remainder_in_polynomial_interpolation"]}
