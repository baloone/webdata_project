{"id":"332282906_Smartphones_enhance_the_management_of_learning_processes_in_higher_education_a_case_study_in_Ajman_University_United_Arab_Emirates","abstract":"Nowadays, students of this generation, specifically seen within higher education, are progressively depending on the means of technology to navigate through their daily lives. A wide variety of smart mobile and tablets devices are used, as digital instruments by university students to support ubiquitous accesses to sources of information and data. Consequently, facilitate the management of students' administrative requirements, e-learning platforms, personal interactions and communication between themselves and their professors.\nThe purpose of this study is to understand mobile technology ownership and usage behaviors among students in Ajman University, United Arab Emirates. The study intends to observe the frequency of technology usage (regarding digital devices) as a tool to access Ajman University's interactive learning platform, Moodle. The objective is to notice whether this provides support or enhances their learning process in any way.\nThis quantitative research paper aims to provide data on students' usage of digital devices in the university and to examine the students' level of skill of technology literacy. This study verifies that smartphones are indeed the preferable digital device for these students to access information and data through learning platforms inside and outside the university.","authors":["Rima Shishakly"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1145/3306500.3306513","Conference: the 10th International Conference"],"references":["319877959_Mobile_Phone_Usage_and_Students'_Perception_towards_M-Learning_A_Case_of_Undergraduate_Students_in_Pakistan","299389643_Adoption_of_Mobile_Technology_in_Higher_Education_Students_Perceptions_of_English_Language_Learning_Using_Smart_Phones","285314040_iLearning_The_future_of_higher_education_Student_perceptions_on_learning_with_mobile_tablets","284563842_The_Effects_of_Integrating_Mobile_Devices_with_Teaching_and_Learning_on_Students'_Learning_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Research_Synthesis","276182517_Characterizing_Smartphone_Usage_Diversity_and_End_User_Context","221537972_Exploring_the_potential_of_mobile_phones_for_active_learning_in_the_classroom","220374785_Defining_Mobile_Learning_in_the_Higher_Education_Landscape","220056796_Using_Mobile_Devices_to_Support_Online_Collaborative_Learning","308364696_A_survey_on_internet_usage_and_online_learning_behaviour_among_medical_undergraduates","304074656_Using_smartphones_as_essential_tools_for_learning_A_call_to_place_schools_on_the_right_side_of_the_21st_century","301391410_Using_mobile_apps_to_support_novice_programming_students","281572731_Characterizing_smartphone_usage_Diversity_and_end_user_context","277986753_Student_Perceptions_of_Mobile_Learning_A_Review_of_Current_Research","262715454_Management_Information_Systems_Managing_the_Digital_Firm","259253331_Portable_Communities_The_Social_Dynamics_of_Online_and_Mobile_Connectedness","259143623_Mobile_Computing_Devices_in_Higher_Education_Student_Perspectives_on_Learning_with_Cellphones_Smartphones_Social_Media","257171161_An_Investigation_of_Mobile_Learning_Readiness_in_Higher_Education_Based_on_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","241679991_Mobile_learning_for_the_twenty-first_century_librarian","237035826_Management_information_systems_managing_the_digital_firm_8th_Edition","230222773_Investigating_the_determinants_and_age_and_gender_differences_in_the_acceptance_of_mobile_learning","220108813_What_does_it_mean_to_be_good_at_using_a_mobile_device_An_investigation_of_three_levels_of_experience_and_skill","50590468_Mobile_Devices_as_'Boundary_Objects'_on_Field_Trips","38178205_Student_teacher_perceptions_of_the_use_of_mobile_technologies_for_teaching_and_learning","27479236_Factors_Affecting_Student_Attitudes_Toward_Flexible_Online_Learning_in_Management_Education","26584763_Investigating_Mobile_Devices_Integration_in_Higher_Education_in_Cyprus_Faculty_Perspectives"]}
