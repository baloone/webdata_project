{"id":"322779298_Nanopore_sequencing_and_assembly_of_a_human_genome_with_ultra-long_reads","abstract":"We report the sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for the human GM12878 Utah/Ceph cell line using the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) nanopore sequencer. 91.2 Gb of sequence data, representing ∼30× theoretical coverage, were produced. Reference-based alignment enabled detection of large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. De novo assembly of nanopore reads alone yielded a contiguous assembly (NG50 ∼3 Mb). We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 > 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38.","authors":["Miten Jain","Sergey Koren","Karen H Miga","Josh Quick"],"meta":["April 2018Nature Biotechnology 36(4)","DOI:10.1038/nbt.4060"],"references":["345904527_Rapid_and_efficient_analysis_of_20000_RNA-seq_samples_with_Toil","345724091_Accurate_detection_of_complex_structural_variations_using_single_molecule_sequencing","345221825_The_megabase-sized_fungal_genome_of_Rhizoctonia_solani_assembled_from_nanopore_reads_only","324842665_Accurate_detection_of_complex_structural_variations_using_single-molecule_sequencing","318336689_Rapid_de_novo_assembly_of_the_European_eel_genome_from_nanopore_sequencing_reads","317749277_Multiplex_PCR_method_for_MinION_and_Illumina_sequencing_of_Zika_and_other_virus_genomes_directly_from_clinical_samples","317577683_A_global_reference_for_human_genetic_variation","316020901_Evaluation_of_GRCh38_and_de_novo_haploid_genome_assemblies_demonstrates_the_enduring_quality_of_the_reference_assembly","318959225_Minimap2_fast_pairwise_alignment_for_long_DNA_sequences","318709072_Sequencing_and_de_novo_assembly_of_150_genomes_from_Denmark_as_a_population_reference","315733411_Sequences_of_95_human_MHC_haplotypes_reveal_extreme_coding_variation_in_genes_other_than_highly_polymorphic_HLA_class_I_and_II","315343659_de_novo_assembly_and_population_genomic_survey_of_natural_yeast_isolates_with_the_Oxford_Nanopore_MinION_sequencer","315173901_Canu_Scalable_and_accurate_long-read_assembly_via_adaptive_k-mer_weighting_and_repeat_separation","314260563_Single-molecule_sequencing_and_chromatin_conformation_capture_enable_de_novo_reference_assembly_of_the_domestic_goat_genome","313889521_Mapping_DNA_Methylation_with_High_Throughput_Nanopore_Sequencing"]}
