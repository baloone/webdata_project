{"id":"337430222_In_vivo_human_head_MRI_at_105T_A_radiofrequency_safety_study_and_preliminary_imaging_results","abstract":"Purpose:\nThe purpose of this study is to safely acquire the first human head images at 10.5T.\n\nMethods:\nTo ensure safety of subjects, we validated the electromagnetic simulation model of our coil. We obtained quantitative agreement between simulated and experimental B1+ and specific absorption rate (SAR). Using the validated coil model, we calculated radiofrequency power levels to safely image human subjects. We conducted all experiments and imaging sessions in a controlled radiofrequency safety lab and the whole-body 10.5T scanner in the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.\n\nResults:\nQuantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental results was obtained including S-parameters, B1+ maps, and SAR. We calculated peak 10 g average SAR using 4 different realistic human body models for a quadrature excitation and demonstrated that the peak 10 g SAR variation between subjects was less than 30%. We calculated safe power limits based on this set and used those limits to acquire T2- and T2*-weighted images of human subjects at 10.5T.\nConclusions:\nIn this study, we acquired the first in vivo human head images at 10.5T using an 8-channel transmit/receive coil. We implemented and expanded a previously proposed workflow to validate the electromagnetic simulation model of the 8-channel transmit/receive coil. Using the validated coil model, we calculated radiofrequency power levels to safely image human subjects.","authors":["Alireza Sadeghi-Tarakameh","Lance DelaBarre","Russell L Lagore","Angel Torrado-Carvajal"],"meta":["July 2020Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 84(1):484-496","DOI:10.1002/mrm.28093"],"references":["335570157_Optimizing_the_Topography_of_Transmit_Coils_for_SAR_Management","333149382_Toward_Human_Head_Imaging_at_105T_Using_an_Eight-Channel_TransmitReceive_Array_of_Bumped_Fractionated_Dipoles","315773569_Radiofrequency_heating_studies_on_anesthetized_swine_using_fractionated_dipole_antennas_at_105_T","315650707_Investigating_the_physiological_effects_of_105_Tesla_static_field_exposure_on_anesthetized_swine_Investigating_the_Effects_of_105T_Static_Field","301565063_Electrodynamics_and_radiofrequency_antenna_concepts_for_human_magnetic_resonance_at_235_T_1_GHz_and_beyond","274572875_Safety_testing_and_operational_procedures_for_self-developed_radiofrequency_coils_Safety_Procedure_for_Self-Developed_RF_Coils","309060086_Probabilistic_analysis_of_the_specific_absorption_rate_intersubject_variability_safety_factor_in_parallel_transmission_MRI","303086716_Improving_peak_local_SAR_prediction_in_parallel_transmit_using_in_situ_S-matrix_measurements","280118545_16-channel_bow_tie_antenna_transceiver_array_for_cardiac_MR_at_70_tesla","276484988_The_fractionated_dipole_antenna_A_new_antenna_for_body_imaging_at_7_Tesla_The_Fractionated_Dipole_Antenna"]}
