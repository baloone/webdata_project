Even, many high schools/vocational schools in Bali have not implemented the E-Report. Implementation of cognitive walkthrough techniques, heuristic evaluation, and users’ experience questionnaire in this research aimed to find out the results of evaluating user experience from the aspects of effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and recommendations for improvement. Effectiveness and efficiency were calculated by Cognitive Walkthrough techniques (CW), user satisfaction by user experience questionnaire techniques (UEQ) and recommendations for improvement, obtained from experts who discuss aspects of usability with Heuristic Evaluation techniques and Cognitive Walkthrough data. Based on the results obtained in terms of users, E-Report has been ineffective and inefficient. While in terms of user satisfaction, respondents were satisfied with Applications E-Report. This is because the effectiveness of a task that has a very large error and failure in one of the features as well as the clarity of results that poor user satisfaction can affect processing time. Therefore, evaluation of user experience based on aspects of usability in the E-Report has not met the criteria for products with good usability. Improvements made on the start page, page values, page value results were done through a photo frame. Therefore, identifying the problems from these three sources can further optimize the usability and improve user experience on E-Report.","authors":["P W S Dewi","G R Dantes","Gede Indrawan"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1516(1):012024","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1516/1/012024"],"references":["339354460_EVALUASI_ANTARMUKA_DAN_PENGALAMAN_PENGGUNA_WEBSITE_SERTA_CODE_REFACTORING_PADA_WEBSITE_E-KOSAN"]}
