{"id":"224255652_Raypath_Separation_with_High_Resolution_Processing","abstract":"In this paper, a high resolution array processing is presented in the context of ocean acoustic tomography for separating raypaths in the DOA-temporal domain. It is a combination of the active large band MUSIC (MUSICAL) with spatio-frequency smoothing processing method. The processing is applied on synthetic data. Compared with the conventional beamforming, this algorithm largely improves the separation performances and presents less artifacts.","authors":["Longyu Jiang","Florian Aulanier","Gregoire Le Touze","Barbara Nicolas"],"meta":["July 2011","DOI:10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003505","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: OCEANS, 2011 IEEE - Spain","Projects: Array processing based on high-order statisticsOcean Acoustic Tomography"],"references":["5324281_Ocean_acoustic_tomography_using_a_double-beamforming_algorithm","3314805_Weighted_Subspace_Methods_and_Spatial_Smoothing_Analysis_and_Comparison","3204168_New_multicomponent_filters_for_geophysical_data_processing","3177856_On_spatial_smoothing_of_estimation_of_coherent_signals","259060651_Ocean_Acoustic_Tomography","243525451_Turning_point_filters_Analysis_of_sound_propagation_on_a_gyre-scale","232637881_High_resolution_spatio-temporal_analysis_by_an_active_array","3178364_On_a_spatial_smoothing_technique_for_multiple_source_location","3177832_Coherent_signal-subspace_processing_for_the_detection_and_estimation_of_Angles_of_arrival_of_multiple_wide-band_sources","3175853_MUSIC_maximum_likelihood_and_Cramer-Rao_bound_Further_results_and_comparisons"]}
