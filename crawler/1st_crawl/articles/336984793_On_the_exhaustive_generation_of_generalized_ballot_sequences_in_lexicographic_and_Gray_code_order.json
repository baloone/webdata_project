{"id":"336984793_On_the_exhaustive_generation_of_generalized_ballot_sequences_in_lexicographic_and_Gray_code_order","abstract":"A generalized (resp. p -ary) ballot sequence is a sequence over the set of non-negative integers (resp. integers less than p ) where in any of its prefixes each positive integer i occurs at most as often as any integer less than i . We show that the Reected Gray Code order induces a cyclic 3-adjacent Gray code on both, the set of fixed length generalized ballot sequences and p -ary ballot sequences when p is even, that is, ordered list where consecutive sequences (regarding the list cyclically) differ in at most 3 adjacent positions. Non-trivial efficient generating algorithms for these ballot sequences, in lexicographic order and for the obtained Gray codes, are also presented.","authors":["Ahmad Sabri","Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["October 2019Pure Mathematics and Applications 28(1):109-119","DOI:10.1515/puma-2015-0035"],"references":["315382940_More_Restricted_Growth_Functions_Gray_Codes_and_Exhaustive_Generation","265362712_Loop-free_sequencing_of_bounded_integer_compositions","261369019_Gray_code_orders_for_q-ary_words_avoiding_a_given_factor","228350570_Lost_and_Found_in_Translation_Andre's_Actual_Method_and_Its_Application_to_the_Generalized_Ballot_Problem","326045587_Exhaustive_generation_for_ballot_sequences_in_lexicographic_and_Gray_code_order","302202728_Combinatorial_Algorithms","285253230_Solution_d'un_probleme","282298277_Reflected_Gray_codes_for_q-ary_words_avoiding_a_given_factor","244958006_A_Loopless_Generation_of_Bitstring_without_p_Consecutive_Ones","241278857_Two_Reflected_Gray_Code-Based_Orders_on_Some_Restricted_Growth_Sequences","220909324_Generating_Gray_Codes_in_O1_Worst-Case_Time_per_Word","224483353_On_Generating_the_N-ary_Reflected_Gray_Codes","222705239_More_restrictive_Gray_codes_for_necklaces_and_Lyndon_words","220406821_On_Rotations_and_the_Generation_of_Binary_Trees","220406820_A_Gray_Code_for_Compositions"]}
