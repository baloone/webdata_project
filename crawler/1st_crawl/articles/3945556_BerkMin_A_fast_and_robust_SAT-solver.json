{"id":"3945556_BerkMin_A_fast_and_robust_SAT-solver","abstract":"We describe a SAT-solver, BerkMin, that inherits such features of GRASP, SATO, and Chaff as clause recording, fast BCP, restarts, and conflict clause \"aging\". At the same time BerkMin introduces a new decision making procedure and a new method of clause database management. We experimentally compare BerkMin with Chaff, the leader among SAT-solvers used in the EDA domain. Experiments show that our solver is more robust than Chaff. BerkMin solved all the instances we used in experiments including very large CNFs from a microprocessor verification benchmark suite. On the other hand, Chaff was not able to complete some instances even with the timeout limit of 16 hours","authors":["Evgueni Goldberg","Yakov Novikov"],"meta":["February 2002","DOI:10.1109/DATE.2002.998262","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, 2002.
