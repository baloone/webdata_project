{"id":"320745895_Tree_Automata_Constructions_from_Regular_Expressions_a_Comparative_Study","abstract":"There exist several methods of computing an automaton recognizing the language denoted by a given regular expression: In the case of words, the position automaton P due to Glushkov, the c-continuation automaton C due to Champarnaud and Ziadi, the follow automaton F due to Ilie and Yu and the equation automaton E due to Antimirov. It has been shown that P and C are isomorphic and that E (resp. F) is a quotient of C (resp. of P). In this paper, we define from a given regular tree expression the position tree automaton P and the follow tree automaton F. Using the definition of the equation tree automaton E of Kuske and Meinecke and our previously defined c-continuation tree automaton C, we show that the previous morphic relations are still valid on tree expressions.","authors":["Ludovic Mignot","Nadia Ouali Sebti","Djelloul Ziadi"],"meta":["October 2017Fundamenta Informaticae 156(1):69-94","DOI:10.3233/FI-2017-1598","Project: Tree automata from regular expressions"],"references":["261136550_k-Position_Follow_Equation_and_k-C-Continuation_Tree_Automata_Constructions","259875009_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Equation_Tree_Automaton_via_the_k-C-Continuations","307174777_Tree_Automata_Techniques_and_Applications","265990523_From_Regular_Tree_Expression_to_Position_Tree_Automaton","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","223254011_Follow_automata","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","222667898_Canonical_derivatives_partial_derivatives_and_finite_automaton_constructions","220657842_Fast_equation_automaton_computation"]}
