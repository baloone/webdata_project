Use of semantic technologies are widely acknowledged for this purpose as they enable devices to understand meaning of data being exchanged. W3C Web of Things (WoT) Working Group is standardizing Thing Description (TD) which is a machine-readable interface of a thing. Further on, iot.schema.org specifies semantics for capabilities of physical devices. Using these models it is possible to describe devices. However, they do not constrain semantics of IoT devices. For example, iot.schema.org provides one capability for a class of devices. Same-class devices, produced by different manufacturers, differ in certain feature or data they offer. In order to represent device variants we propose to extend iot.schema.org Capabilities with RDF Shapes. In our approach, TDs for device variants are automatically generated. It also enhances device discovery, semantic interoperability, validation of TDs and accelerates IoT application development.","authors":["Aparna Thuluva","Darko Anicic","Sebastian Rudolph"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_56","In book: The Semantic Web: ESWC 2018 Satellite Events (pp.409-422)"],"references":["320119685_Validating_RDF_Data","269308967_Enrich_machine-to-machine_data_with_semantic_web_technologies_for_cross-domain_applications","266661774_Shape_expressions_An_RDF_validation_and_transformation_language","259922825_Semantics_for_the_Internet_of_Things_Early_Progress_and_Back_to_the_Future","256092056_The_SSN_Ontology_of_the_W3C_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Incubator_Group","235343161_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_from_the_Data-Centric_Perspective","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","323312848_Semantic_Discovery_in_the_Web_of_Things","310821630_Brick_Towards_a_Unified_Metadata_Schema_For_Buildings","268451798_Using_Description_Logics_for_RDF_Constraint_Checking_and_Closed-World_Recognition","238667673_eClassOWL_A_Fully-Fledged_Products_and_Services_Ontology_in_OWL","235642082_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Applications_and_Research_Challenges"]}
