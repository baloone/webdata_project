{"id":"301435490_Adaptive_Control_for_UAVs_Equipped_with_a_Robotic_Arm","abstract":"This paper deals with the trajectory tracking control for quadrotor aerial vehicles equipped with a robotic manipulator. The proposed approach is based on a two-layer controller: in the top layer, an inverse kinematics algorithm computes the motion references for the actuated variables while in the bottom layer, an adaptive motion control algorithm is in charge of tracking the motion references. A stability analysis of the closed-loop system is developed. Finally, a simulation case study is presented to prove the effectiveness of the approach.","authors":["Fabrizio Caccavale"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.3182/20140824-6-ZA-1003.00790","Conference: World Congress"],"references":["261353511_Aerial_grasping_of_a_moving_target_with_a_quadrotor_UAV","260504250_Discrete-Time_Framework_for_Fault_Diagnosis_in_Robotic_Manipulators","221076856_Backstepping_and_Sliding-mode_Techniques_Applied_to_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","3414630_Second-order_kinematic_control_of_robot_manipulators_with_Jacobian_damped_least-squares_inverse_Theory_and_experiments","261270307_Adaptive_trajectory_tracking_for_quadrotor_MAVs_in_presence_of_parameter_uncertainties_and_external_disturbances","261202244_Control_of_quadrotor_aerial_vehicles_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","225521797_Multi-UAV_Cooperation_and_Control_for_Load_Transportation_and_Deployment","3497503_Dynamic_control_of_redundant_manipulators"]}
