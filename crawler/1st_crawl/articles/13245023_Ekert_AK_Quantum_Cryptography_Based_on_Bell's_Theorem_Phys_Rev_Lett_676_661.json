The proposed scheme is based on the Bohm's version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen gedanken experiment and Bell's theorem is used to test for eavesdropping.","authors":["Artur Ekert"],"meta":["September 1991Physical Review Letters 67(6):661-663","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.661","SourcePubMed"],"references":["228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","228109475_Experimental_Realization_of_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm_Gedankenexperiment_A_New_Violation_of_Bell's_Inequalities","243684838_Quantum_Computational_Networks","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","234790348_Experimental_quantum_cryptography_the_dawn_of_a_new_era_for_quantum_cryptography_the_experimental_prototype_is_working","234782642_Conjugate_Coding","228109474_Experimental_Test_of_Bell's_Inequalities_Using_Time-_Varying_Analyzers","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems"]}
