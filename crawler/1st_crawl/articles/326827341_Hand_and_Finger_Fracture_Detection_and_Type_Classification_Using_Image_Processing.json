{"id":"326827341_Hand_and_Finger_Fracture_Detection_and_Type_Classification_Using_Image_Processing","abstract":"The current research introduces a novel method for fracture detection and classification. The basic stages of fracture detection includes preprocessing of bone image and morphological operations to obtain the ROI region which is manipulated by a post processing stage to remove non-fracture pixels. The suggested approach extract three features from bone image which are transverse, cracks and divergence features in order to define the fracture type or integrity of bone image. The designed systems detect the different fracture types correctly beside the hybrid fracture type. We applied experiments on a dataset consisting of 155 bone images including 100 fracture images, 30 hand-fingers images and 25 normal images. The systems achieved 92% true detection rate for general bone fractures, 93.33% true detection rate for finger bone fractures and 93.33% true rejection rate. The experiments showed that the inner false detection rates between each type and the others are less than 4%.","authors":["Mariam Saii","Ali Mayya"],"meta":["August 2018","Project: PhD Project"],"references":["326262436_Iris_and_Palmprint_Decision_Fusion_to_Enhance_Human_Recognition","326262290_Human_Recognition_Based_On_Ear_Shape_Images_Using_PCA-Wavelets_and_Different_Classification_Methods","326262202_Lung_Detection_and_Segmentation_Using_Marker_Watershed_and_Laplacian_Filtering","326262191_Hybrid_Recognition_System_under_Feature_Selection_and_Fusion","280036354_Determining_the_Type_of_Long_Bone_Fractures_in_X-Ray_Images","354788036_Detection_of_Bone_Fracture_using_Image_Processing_Methods","333057032_Radius_Bone_Fracture_Detection_Using_Morphological_Gradient_Based_Image_Segmentation_Technique_International_Journal_of_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technologies_ISSN_0975-9676_Online","321294018_Bone_Fracture_Detection_Using_Edge_Detection_Technique"]}
