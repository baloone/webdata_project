They explore each metric, considering best methods for collecting, analyzing, and presenting the data. They provide step-by-step guidance for measuring the usability of any type of product using any type of technology. Presents criteria for selecting the most appropriate metric for every case Takes a product and technology neutral approach Presents in-depth case studies to show how organizations have successfully used the metrics and the information they revealed.","authors":["William Albert","Thomas Tullis"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-373558-4.X0001-5","Project: Measuring UX"],"references":["275474358_The_Evaluator_Effect_in_Usability_Studies_Problem_Detection_and_Severity_Judgments","220168871_Eye_tracking_study_on_Web-use_Comparison_between_younger_and_elderly_users_in_case_of_search_task_with_electronic_timetable_service","200553212_Describing_usability_problems_Are_we_sending_the_right_message","225934914_Pupillary_response_as_a_general_measure_of_activation","220383252_Remote_Usability_Testing","200553012_Making_usability_recommendations_useful_and_usable","8646682_Stress_Response_Caused_by_System_Response_Time_when_Searching_for_Information_on_the_Internet"]}
