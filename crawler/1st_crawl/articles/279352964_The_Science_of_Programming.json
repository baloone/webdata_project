{"id":"279352964_The_Science_of_Programming","abstract":"The programmer has two main concerns: correctness and efficiency. Thus far, this book has dealt mainly with the issue of correctness. This does not mean that efficiency is unimportant. When faced with any large task, it is usually best to put aside some of its aspects for a moment and to concentrate on the others, and that is what we have been doing. This important principle is called Separation of Concerns.","authors":["David Gries"],"meta":["January 1981","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4612-5983-1_20","In book: The Science of Programming (pp.237-252)"],"references":[]}
