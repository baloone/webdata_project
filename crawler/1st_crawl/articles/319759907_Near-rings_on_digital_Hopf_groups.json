{"id":"319759907_Near-rings_on_digital_Hopf_groups","abstract":"In this paper, we study the digital Hopf groups and the digital Hopf functions between digital Hopf spaces with digital multiplications, and construct a near-ring structure on the set of all pointed digital homotopy classes of digital Hopf functions between pointed digital Hopf groups. We also investigate a near-ring homomorphism between near-rings based on the pointed digital Hopf groups to find a new method of how to give answers to the original problems or how to get a new information out of old ones more effectively.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["June 2018Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 29(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00200-017-0341-z","Project: NRF-2015R1D1A1A09057449"],"references":["316375538_On_the_digitally_quasi_comultiplications_of_digital_images","314981629_Comultiplication_structures_for_awedge_of_spheres","279764967_Digital_Homotopy_Fixed_Point_Theory","263511432_Some_Properties_of_Digital_H-spaces","309362904_On_the_same_n-types_for_the_wedges_of_the_Eilenberg-Maclane_spaces","282625209_Adaptive_graph_construction_using_data_self-representativeness_for_pattern_classification","271898514_On_the_generalized_same_N-type_conjecture","268633270_Introduction_to_Homotopy_Theory","267178100_Simple_and_Semisimple_Near-Rings","263550755_Some_properties_of_digital_H-spaces","262769039_On_inverses_and_algebraic_loops_of_co-H-spaces","243066665_On_the_same_N-type_conjecture_for_the_suspension_of_the_infinite_complex_projective_space","242992305_On_maps_of_H-spaces","242983669_On_the_same_N_-type_structure_for_the_suspension_of_the_Eilenberg-Mac_Lane_spaces","238852710_Properties_of_comultiplications_on_a_wedge_of_spheres"]}
