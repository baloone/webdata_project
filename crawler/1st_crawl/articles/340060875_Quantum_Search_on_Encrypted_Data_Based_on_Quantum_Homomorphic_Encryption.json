{"id":"340060875_Quantum_Search_on_Encrypted_Data_Based_on_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption","abstract":"We propose a homomorphic search protocol based on quantum homomorphic encryption, in which a client Alice with limited quantum ability can give her encrypted data to a powerful but untrusted quantum server and let the server search for her without decryption. By outsourcing the interactive key-update process to a trusted key center, Alice only needs to prepare and encrypt her original data and to decrypt the ciphered search result in linear time. Besides, we also present a compact and perfectly secure quantum homomorphic evaluation protocol for Clifford circuits, where the decryption key can be calculated by Alice with polynomial overhead with respect to the key length.","authors":["Qing Zhou","Songfeng Lu","Yongquan Cui","Li Li"],"meta":["March 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-61791-9"],"references":["337685994_Teleportation-based_quantum_homomorphic_encryption_scheme_with_quasi-compactness_and_perfect_security","312437466_An_Efficient_Quantum_Somewhat_Homomorphic_Symmetric_Searchable_Encryption","345430645_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_scheme_with_flexible_number_of_evaluator_based_on_k_n-threshold_quantum_state_sharing","326566762_Quantum_FHE_Almost_As_Secure_As_Classical_38th_Annual_International_Cryptology_Conference_Santa_Barbara_CA_USA_August_19-23_2018_Proceedings_Part_III","320344833_Practical_quantum_somewhat-homomorphic_encryption_with_coherent_states","305472505_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption_for_Polynomial-Sized_Circuits","280773270_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_from_quantum_codes","277722736_Delegating_Private_Quantum_Computations","271721882_A_Survey_of_Provably_Secure_Searchable_Encryption","270287377_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption_for_Circuits_of_Low_T-gate_Complexity"]}
