{"id":"335551146_Matching_Patterns_with_Variables","abstract":"A pattern \\(\\alpha \\) (i. e., a string of variables and terminals) matches a word w, if w can be obtained by uniformly replacing the variables of \\(\\alpha \\) by terminal words. The respective matching problem, i. e., deciding whether or not a given pattern matches a given word, is generally Open image in new window -complete, but can be solved in polynomial-time for classes of patterns with restricted structure. In this paper we overview a series of recent results related to efficient matching for patterns with variables, as well as a series of extensions of this problem.","authors":["Florin Manea","Markus L.
