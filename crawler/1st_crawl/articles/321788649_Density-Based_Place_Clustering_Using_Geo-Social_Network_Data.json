{"id":"321788649_Density-Based_Place_Clustering_Using_Geo-Social_Network_Data","abstract":"Spatial clustering deals with the unsupervised grouping of places into clusters and finds important applications in urban planning and marketing. Current spatial clustering models disregard information about the people who are related to the clustered places. In this paper, we show how the density-based clustering paradigm can be extended to apply on places which are visited by users of a geo-social network. Our model considers spatio-temporal information and the social relationships between users who visit the clustered places. After formally defining the model and the distance measure it relies on, we present efficient algorithms for its implementation, based on spatial indexing. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via a case study on real data; in addition, we design two quantitative measures, called social entropy and community score to evaluate the quality of the discovered clusters. The results show that temporal-geo-social clusters have special properties and cannot be found by applying simple spatial clustering approaches. The efficiency of our index-based implementation is also evaluated experimentally.","authors":["Dingming Wu","Jieming Shi","Nikos Mamoulis"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2017.2782256"],"references":["281897562_Anytime_density-based_clustering_of_complex_data","273005469_Topological_Properties_and_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Place_Networks_in_Urban_Environments","261150932_ComeTogether_Discovering_Communities_of_Places_in_Mobility_Data","242479489_Kumar_V_A_Fast_and_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_for_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs_SIAM_Journal_on_Scientific_Computing_201_359-392","236675136_Scalable_Analysis_of_Movement_Data_for_Extracting_and_Exploring_Significant_Places","236002026_Spatio-Temporal_Clustering_Methods_Classification","221654073_Human_mobility_social_ties_and_link_prediction","221653291_Exploiting_Place_Features_in_Link_Prediction_on_Location-based_Social_Networks","221653181_Community_identification_in_dynamic_social_networks","221297942_Socio-Spatial_Properties_of_Online_Location-Based_Social_Networks","221214752_OPTICS_Ordering_Points_to_Identify_the_Clustering_Structure","221022529_Find_me_if_you_can_Improving_geographical_prediction_with_social_and_spatial_proximity","220907306_Finding_Clusters_of_Different_Sizes_Shapes_and_Densities_in_Noisy_High_Dimensional_Data","44122150_Interactive_Cluster_Analysis_of_Diverse_Types_of_Spatiotemporal_Data","2955136_CHAMELEON_A_hierarchical_clustering_algorithm_using_dynamic_modeling","2334693_Efficient_and_Effective_Clustering_Methods_for_Spatial_Data_Mining","314818914_SimRank_a_measure_of_structural-context_similarity","305054839_Topological_Properties_and_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Place_Networks_in_Urban_Environments","270548896_A_general_framework_for_geoSocial_query_processing","266656584_Density-based_place_clustering_in_geo-social_networks","261847088_EBM_-_An_entropy-based_model_to_infer_social_strength_from_spatiotemporal_data","259519014_Algorithm_to_determine_e-distance_parameter_in_density_based_clustering","241770678_On_socio-spatial_group_query_for_location-based_social_networks","232594605_Similarity_and_propinquity_in_friendship_formation","229067993_Social_Pressures_in_Informal_Groups_a_Study_of_Human_Factors_in_Housing","228058977_A_Tractable_Approach_to_Finding_Closest_Truncated-commute-time_Neighborsin_Large_Graphs","225248456_Density-Based_Clustering_in_Spatial_Databases_The_Algorithm_GDBSCAN_and_Its_Applications","223884481_An_adaptive_unsupervised_approach_toward_pixel_clustering_and_color_image_segmentation","223624491_CURE_An_efficient_clustering_algorithm_for_large_databases","223059919_ST-DBSCAN_An_algorithm_for_clustering_spatial-temporal_data","221654226_SCAN_A_Structural_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Networks","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","221571031_Mining_Spatial-temporal_Clusters_from_Geo-databases","221214812_Clustering_Objects_on_a_Spatial_Network","220895059_Geo-spatial_Clustering_with_Non-spatial_Attributes_and_Geographic_Non-overlapping_Constraint_A_Penalized_Spatial_Distance_Measure","216634741_The_Small_World_Problem","200110620_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","45913059_Empirical_Comparison_of_Algorithms_for_Network_Community_Detection","44687459_Link_Communities_Reveal_Multiscale_Complexity_in_Networks","30012937_An_Efficient_Approach_to_Clustering_in_Large_Multimedia_Databases_with_Noise","8036129_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","6110170_An_Inverse_Distance_Variation_For_Certain_Social_Influences","4324201_Local_Probabilistic_Models_for_Link_Prediction","2500574_BIRCH_An_Efficient_Data_Clustering_Method_for_Very_Large_Databases","2175488_Graph_Evolution_Densification_and_Shrinking_Diameters"]}
