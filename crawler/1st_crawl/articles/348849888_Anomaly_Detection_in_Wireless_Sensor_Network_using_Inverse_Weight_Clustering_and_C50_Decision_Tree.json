{"id":"348849888_Anomaly_Detection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_using_Inverse_Weight_Clustering_and_C50_Decision_Tree","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Network is a network of integrated sensors for environmental sensing, data processing and communication with other sensors and the base station. At the same time WSNs are vulnerable to security breaches, attacks and information leakage. Anomaly detection techniques are used to detect such activities over the network that does not conform to the normal behavior of the network communication. In this paper, two machine learning algorithms Iinverse Weight Clustering (IWC) and C5.0 decision tree for classifying anomalous and normal activities in a wireless sensor network have been used. The IWC clustering method is first used to partition the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, decision trees are built using C5.0 decision tree algorithm. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the subgroups within the cluster. The experiment carried out on three different datasets (University of North Carolina Greensboro(UNCG), Intel Berkeley Research Lab(IBRL) and Bharatpur Airport WSN); the results indicated that proposed method achieved detection rate of 98.9% at false alarm-rate of 0.31% on IBRL; detection rate of 99.57% at false alarm-rate of 0.35% on Bharatpur Airport.","authors":["Pramod Kumar Chaudhary","Arun Kumar Timalsina"],"meta":["January 2021","Conference: IOE Graduate Conference 2019 - WinterAt: Pokhara, Nepal"],"references":["312201341_A_new_approach_of_anomaly_detection_in_wireless_sensor_networks_using_support_vector_data_description","304104515_An_Efficient_Hybrid_Anomaly_Detection_Scheme_Using_K-Means_Clustering_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","271891551_Network_Anomaly_Detection_by_Cascading_K-Means_Clustering_and_C45_Decision_Tree_algorithm","259169407_A_hybrid_network_intrusion_detection_framework_based_on_random_forests_and_weighted_K-means","255646203_Inverse_Weighted_Clustering_Algorithm","233893151_Intrusion_detection_based_on_K-Means_clustering_and_Naive_Bayes_classification","284467463_An_Efficient_Hybrid_Intrusion_Detection_System_based_on_C50_and_SVM","259138030_A_novel_hybrid_intrusion_detection_method_integrating_anomaly_detection_with_misuse_detection","224574525_An_Intrusion_Detection_Algorithm_Based_on_Decision_Tree_Technology","223317630_Design_of_multiple-level_hybrid_classifier_for_intrusion_detection_system_using_Bayesian_clustering_and_decision_trees"]}
