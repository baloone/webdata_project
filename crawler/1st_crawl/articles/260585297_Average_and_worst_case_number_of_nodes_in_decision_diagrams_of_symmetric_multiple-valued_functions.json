{"id":"260585297_Average_and_worst_case_number_of_nodes_in_decision_diagrams_of_symmetric_multiple-valued_functions","abstract":"We derive the average and worst case number of nodes in decision diagrams of r-valued symmetric functions of n variables. We show that, for large n, both numbers approach nr/rl. For binary decision diagrams (r=2), we compute the distribution of the number of functions on n variables with a specified number of nodes. Subclasses of symmetric functions appear as features in this distribution. For example, voting functions are noted as having an average of n2/6 nodes, for large n, compared to n2/2, for general binary symmetric functions","authors":["Jon T. Butler","David S.
