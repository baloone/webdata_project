{"id":"224904730_Euclidean_Distance_Geometry_and_Applications","abstract":"Euclidean distance geometry is the study of Euclidean geometry based on the\nconcept of distance. This is useful in several applications where the input\ndata consists of an incomplete set of distances, and the output is a set of\npoints in Euclidean space that realizes the given distances. We survey some of\nthe theory of Euclidean distance geometry and some of the most important\napplications: molecular conformation, localization of sensor networks and\nstatics.","authors":["Leo Liberti","Carlile Lavor","Nelson Maculan","Antonio Mucherino"],"meta":["May 2012SIAM Review 56(1)","DOI:10.1137/120875909","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281048932_Finding_Low-Energy_Homopolymer_Conformations_by_a_Discrete_Approach","330132118_Spheres_Unions_and_Intersections_and_Some_of_their_Applications_in_Molecular_Modeling","324466982_Rigid_and_Flexible_Frameworks","324351108_The_Construction_Study_of_Certain_Important_Algebras","313638856_Nouvelles_methodes_pour_le_calcul_des_travures_reticulaires","312879591_Some_distance_properties_of_latent_root_and_vector_methods_used_in_multivariate_data_analysis","289240516_Theory_of_semidefinite_programming_for_sensor_network_localization","285981037_Global_continuation_for_distance_geometry_problems","284826906_The_method_of_triads_for_nonmetric_multidimensional_scaling","277531856_Protein_Structure_Determination_in_Solution_by_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy"]}
