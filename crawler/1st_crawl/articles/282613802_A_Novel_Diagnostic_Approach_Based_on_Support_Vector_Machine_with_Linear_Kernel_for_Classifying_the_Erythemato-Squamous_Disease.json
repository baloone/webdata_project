{"id":"282613802_A_Novel_Diagnostic_Approach_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machine_with_Linear_Kernel_for_Classifying_the_Erythemato-Squamous_Disease","abstract":"The diagnosis of the arythema disease is a real difficulty in dermatology. It causes redness induced in the lower\nlevel of the skin by hyperemia of the capillaries. It can harm several skin damages, inflammations. In this paper, we have put our efforts to design a diagnostic approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel by classifying the erythemato-squamous disease. SVM being a large margin classifier is a powerful pattern recognition and machine learning methodology that is widely used for both linear and non-linear\nclassification problems. Comparing testing on different kernel methods, we have noticed that our method gives the better accuracy. Choosing the optimal value of the parameters is a crucial criterion and this was achieved by performing 3 fold cross-validations.","authors":["Avik Basu","Sanjiban Sekhar Roy","Ajith Abraham"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.72","Conference: 2015 International Conference on Computing Communication Control and AutomationAt: Pune"],"references":["266736596_Decision_Support_System_on_the_Grid","222016269_Ensemble_strategies_for_a_medical_diagnostic_decision_support_system_A_breast_cancer_diagnosis_application","221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","220637823_Ensemble-based_classifiers","215990408_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","13587421_Learning_differential_diagnosis_of_erythemato-squamous_diseases_using_voting_feature_intervals","3420408_Support_vector_machines","312538118_Support-vector_networks","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","272623654_Libsvm","271575190_Automatic_detection_of_erythemato-squamous_diseases_using_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_systems","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","265814022_Ensemble_strategies_for_a_medical_diagnostic_decision_support_system_A_breast_cancer_diagnosis_application","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","227867104_Neural_network_ensembles_Combining_multiple_models_for_enhanced_performance_using_a_multistage_approach","225070191_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-Line_Learning_and_an_Application_to_Boosting","224890800_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_an_update","222961095_The_support_vector_machine_under_test","222839840_Expert_system_for_the_differential_diagnosis_of_erythemato-squamous_diseases","222041998_A_new_feature_selection_method_based_on_association_rules_for_diagnosis_of_erythemato-squamous_diseases","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","220215692_Ubeyli_ED_Combined_neural_networks_for_diagnosis_of_erythemato-squamous_diseases_Expert_Syst_Appl_363_5107-5112","209436387_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Regression","201841001_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-Line_Learning_and_an_Application_to_Boosting","7702761_Using_LogitBoost_classifier_to_predict_protein_structural_classes","7623902_Automatic_detection_of_erthemato-squamous_disease_using_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_systems","5563851_WeAidU_-_A_decision_support_system_for_myocardial_perfusion_images_using_artificial_neural_networks","2631839_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
