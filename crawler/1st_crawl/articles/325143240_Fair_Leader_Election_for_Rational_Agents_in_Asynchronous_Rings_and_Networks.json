{"id":"325143240_Fair_Leader_Election_for_Rational_Agents_in_Asynchronous_Rings_and_Networks","abstract":"We study a game theoretic model where a coalition of processors might collude to bias the outcome of the protocol, where we assume that the processors always prefer any legitimate outcome over a non-legitimate one. We show that the problems of Fair Leader Election and Fair Coin Toss are equivalent, and focus on Fair Leader Election.\nOur main focus is on a directed asynchronous ring of n processors, where we investigate the protocol proposed by Abraham et al. [4] and studied in Afek et al. [5]. We show that in general the protocol is resilient only to sub-linear size coalitions. Specifically, we show that Ω( p n logn) randomly located processors or Ω( 3 √ n) adversarially located processors can force any outcome. We complement this by showing that the protocol is resilient to any adversarial coalition of size O( 4 √ n). We propose a modification to the protocol, and show that it is resilient to every coalition of size ?( √ n), by exhibiting both an attack and a resilience result.\nFor every k ≥ 1, we define a family of graphs Gk that can be simulated by trees where each node in the tree simulates at most k processors. We show that for every graph in Gk , there is no fair leader election protocol that is resilient to coalitions of size k. Our result generalizes a previous result of Abraham et al. [4] that states that for every graph, there is no fair leader election protocol which is resilient to coalitions of size ?n/2 ?.","authors":["Assaf Yifrach","Yishay Mansour"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3212734.3212767"],"references":["321070376_Cheating_by_Duplication_Equilibrium_Requires_Global_Knowledge","287198069_Fault_Tolerance_Mechanisms_in_Distributed_Systems","266659335_Distributed_computing_building_blocks_for_rational_agents","221343544_Scalable_rational_secret_sharing","221343241_Distributed_computing_meets_game_theory_Robust_mechanisms_for_rational_secret_sharing_and_multiparty_computation","220910037_BAR_fault_tolerance_for_cooperative_services","220687015_Byzantine_consensus_in_asynchronous_message-passing_systems_A_survey","220616663_Perfect-Information_Leader_Election_with_Optimal_Resilience","220555350_Distributed_Computing_Meets_Game_Theory_Combining_Insights_From_Two_Fields","1888062_Lower_Bounds_on_Implementing_Robust_and_Resilient_Mediators","318123578_Rational_Fair_Consensus_in_the_Gossip_Model","317188044_Rational_Fair_Consensus_in_the_GOSSIP_Model","291245525_Distributed_Protocols_for_Leader_Election_A_Game-Theoretic_Perspective","247131761_Perfect_information_leader_election_in_log","239593861_Distributed_Computing_A_Locality-Sensitive_Approach","222441894_An_On_log_n_Unidirectional_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Extrema_Finding_in_a_Circle","221591908_Randomness-Optimal_Sampling_Extractors_and_Constructive_Leader_Election","221590243_Games_for_exchanging_information","221355247_Rationality_and_Adversarial_Behavior_in_Multi-Party_Computation","221354065_Efficient_Rational_Secret_Sharing_in_Standard_Communication_Networks","221343382_When_selfish_meets_evil_Byzantine_players_in_a_virus_inoculation_game","221039317_Regret_Freedom_Isn't_Free","220617813_Coin-Flipping_Games_Immune_Against_Linear-Sized_Coalitions","220532946_A_Robust_Noncryptographic_Protocol_for_Collective_Coin_Flipping","220441455_The_influence_of_large_coalitions","220422707_An_Improved_Algorithm_for_Decentralized_Extrema-Finding_in_Circular_Configurations_of_Processes","220404811_An_Onlog_n_Unidirectional_Algorithm_for_the_Circular_Extrema_Problem","220333642_Rational_Secret_Sharing_Revisited","1959878_Rational_Secret_Sharing_and_Multiparty_Computation_Extended_Abstract"]}
