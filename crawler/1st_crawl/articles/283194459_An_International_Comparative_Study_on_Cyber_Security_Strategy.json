{"id":"283194459_An_International_Comparative_Study_on_Cyber_Security_Strategy","abstract":"It is expected that utilization and expansion of cyber-space on the basis of big data, cloud computing and IoT(Internet of Things) will be a critical factor which determines national competitiveness. In the meantime, cyber threat accompanied by the utilization of cyber space, attacks targeting cyber space, became enhanced and complicated. Besides this, attackers were also more organized with economic and political intention. As a result, damage caused by the attacks targeting cyber-space has already brought about social confusion. This paper analyzes various countries' cyber security strategy by focusing on public-private partnership, which is one of the common grounds of the strategies. Especially, it focuses on how each country establishes institutional framework of the partnership related to infra-protection. The subject of analysis is limited to U. S. A, EU and Japan. Consequently, the countries, to some degree, adopt intervention policy through cyber security strategy, and government control is changing from voluntary self-regulation to enforced self-regulation in general. Additionally, public-partnership is more and more emphasized.","authors":["Kyoung-Sik Min","Seung-Woan Chai","Mijeong Han"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Security and its Applications 9(2):13-20","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.2.02"],"references":["261950643_Nineteen_National_Cyber_Security_Strategies","227426674_Cybersecurity_Stakeholder_incentives_externalities_and_policy_options","256021178_The_Governance_of_Network_and_Information_Security_In_the_European_Union_The_European_Public-Private_Partnership_for_Resilience_EP3R","228123953_Public-Private_Partnerships_Are_No_Silver_Bullet_An_Expanded_Governance_Model_for_Critical_Infrastructure_Protection"]}
