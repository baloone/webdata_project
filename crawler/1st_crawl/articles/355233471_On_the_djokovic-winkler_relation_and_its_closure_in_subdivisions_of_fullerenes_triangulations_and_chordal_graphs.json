{"id":"355233471_On_the_djokovic-winkler_relation_and_its_closure_in_subdivisions_of_fullerenes_triangulations_and_chordal_graphs","abstract":"It was recently pointed out that certain SiO2 layer structures and SiO2 nanotubes can be described as full subdivisions aka subdivision graphs of partial cubes. A key tool for analyzing distance-based topological indices in molecular graphs is the Djokovic-Winkler relation and its transitive closure In this paper we study the behavior of and with respect to full subdivisions. We apply our results to describe in full subdivisions of fullerenes, plane triangulations, and chordal graphs. Â© 2021 University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Science.
