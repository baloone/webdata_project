{"id":"293014912_On_Homogeneous_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","abstract":"A geometric homogeneity is introduced for evolution equations in a Banach space. Scalability property of solutions of homogeneous evolution equations is proven. Some qualitative characteristics of stability of trivial solution are also provided. In particular, finite-time stability of homogeneous evolution equations is studied. Theoretical results are illustrated on important classes of partial differential equations.","authors":["Andrey Polyakov","Denis Efimov","Emilia Fridman","Wilfrid Perruquetti"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(11):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2525925","Project: A convex optimization approach to control of infinite-dimensional systems"],"references":["280751603_Finite-time_Stabilization_Using_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Technique","269292599_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_for_MIMO_Systems_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach","269292352_Homogeneous_Differentiator_Design_using_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Method","266560754_Finite-time_stabilization_of_a_network_of_strings","264234402_Finite-Time_Stabilization_of_22_Hyperbolic_Systems_on_Tree-Shaped_Networks","262564817_Super-stability_and_the_spectrum_of_one-dimensional_wave_equations_on_general_feedback_controlled_networks","226631857_Homogeneous_Lyapunov_functions_and_necessary_conditions_for_stabilization","226198448_Stability_of_separable_solutions_for_fast_diffusion","224613904_A_strict_Lyapunov_function_for_boundary_control_of_hyperbolic_systems_of_conservation_laws","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","47864230_Behaviour_near_extinction_for_the_Fast_Diffusion_Equation_on_bounded_domains","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","3033027_Finite-Time_Observers_Application_to_Secure_Communication","3032609_A_Strict_Lyapunov_Function_for_Boundary_Control_of_Hyperbolic_Systems_of_Conservation_Laws","329530664_Nonlinear_evolution_equations","317984626_Soliton_solutions_for_nonlinear_evolution_equations_by_using_inverse_scattering_method","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284491471_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_uniform_homogeneous_right-hand_sides","275808048_Flows_on_Homogeneous_Spaces","271465981_Positive_Definiteness_of_Generalized_Homogeneous_Functions","271429052_Finite-Time_Stabilization_Using_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Technique","267928734_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_stabilization_Implicit_Lyapunov_function_approach","267091869_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_of_Monotone_Type_in_Banach_Spaces","266719451_Nonlinear_Evolution_Equations","264235292_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","260028400_On_Homogeneity_and_Its_Application_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","250677663_On_Stability_in_Control_Systems","248795680_The_Stability_of_Solutions_of_Differential_Equations_in_Banach_Space","246104580_Etude_de_quelques_problemes_de_stabilisation","243774453_Nilpotent_Approximations_of_Control_Systems_and_Distributions","243093026_Finite_Time_Controllers","239745123_A_class_of_nonlinear_degenerating_parabolic_equations","235209268_Regularizing_Effects_of_Homogeneous_Evolution_Equations","232951634_On_the_Change_of_Form_of_Long_Waves_Advancing_in_a_Rectangular_Canal_and_a_New_Type_of_Long_Stationary_Waves","227286756_Topological_characterization_of_the_dilation_and_the_translation_in_Frechet_spaces","226547847_Solitons_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations_and_the_inverse_scattering_transform","226449128_Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_complete_blow-up_and_extinction_for_one-dimensional_quasilinear_heat_equations","225664706_Subelliptic_estimates_and_function_spaces_on_nilpotent_Lie_groups","223187922_On_the_Integrability_of_Homogeneous_Scalar_Evolution_Equations","222855100_Universal_stabilization_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems_with_homogeneous_vector_field","222671592_H_control_stabilization_and_input-output_stability_of_nonlinear_systems_with_homogeneous_properties","222479166_Homogenous_Lyapunov_function_for_homogenous_continuous_vector_field","221658469_Methods_of_A_M_Lyapunov_and_Their_Application","221658425_The_Stability_of_Motion","220259790_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Robust_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems","48417854_Oscillations_Conditions_in_Homogenous_Systems","30858526_Finite-Time_Stability_of_Continuous_Autonomous_Systems","30846679_Geometric_homogeneity_with_application_to_finite-time_stability","2596474_Geometric_Homogeneity_And_Stabilization","2148681_Classification_of_integrable_polynomial_vector_evolution_equations"]}
