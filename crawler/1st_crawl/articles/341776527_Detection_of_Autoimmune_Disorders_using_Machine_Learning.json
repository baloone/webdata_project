{"id":"341776527_Detection_of_Autoimmune_Disorders_using_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Machine learning is called future of computer science. Machine learning is being extensively used in research fields. One of such fields is Health Care sector. Machine learning algorithms are being used for prediction and detection of diseases. Autoimmune disorder is a class of diseases in which immune system attacks healthy body tissues and cause inflammation.Discoveries in the last decade have made research in autoimmune disorders one of the most promising areas [1]. These diseases are one of the most widespread diseases in modern world. These diseases are considered chronic because they are known to be aggressive to healthy body tissues. And hence, early diagnosis and treatment are considered vital for a good life. Now days, a lot of health related systems are being implemented using machine learning and artificial intelligence like fitbits, mobile apps providing a more comprehensive view of a patient than has been ever seen before. These tools along with other signs on body components like blood, organs etc. can be used to determine if patient is suffering from an autoimmune disorder or not. And hence treatment can be started at early stages. This work will help us for early detection of autoimmune disorders based on these factors. We have used GINI index decision tree for predicting whether a person is having Rheumatoid Arthritis or not.","authors":["Vivek Mohali","Priyanka Mohali","Nishtha Hooda"],"meta":["May 2020Test Engineering and Management 82(Vol. 82: Jan/Feb 2020):16730 - 16735"],"references":["6639744_What_is_a_Support_Vector_Machine"]}
