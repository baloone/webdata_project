{"id":"318126535_Discrete-Time_Predictor_Feedback_for_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Delays","abstract":"This note develops a discrete-time predictor feedback control scheme for continuous-time multi-agent systems with input and communication time-delays. With measurement of locally available relative state signals among neighbored agents, the controller is able to achieve consensus for a large variety of linear open-loop agent dynamics, including exponentially unstable systems. Moreover, the new design can deal with arbitrarily large time-delays in some special scenarios. The feature of discrete-time and relative state measurement substantially saves implementation cost compared with the existing methods in literature. Numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical design.","authors":["Anton Ponomarev","Zhiyong Chen","Hai-Tao Zhang"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 63(2):498-504","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2722860"],"references":["228864111_Semiglobal_stabilization_of_continuous_systems_with_bounded_delayed_inputs","224138089_Delay-Adaptive_Predictor_Feedback_for_Systems_With_Unknown_Long_Actuator_Delay","224108730_Generalized_Nyquist_consensus_condition_for_high-order_linear_multi-agent_systems_with_communication_delays","224090218_Input_Delay_Compensation_for_Forward_Complete_and_Strict-Feedforward_Nonlinear_Systems","48165726_Nonlinear_Stabilization_Under_Sampled_and_Delayed_Measurements_and_With_Inputs_Subject_to_Delay_and_Zero-Order_Hold","313637341_Finite_spectrum_assignment_problem_for_systems_with_delays","313286305_Consensus_of_a_class_of_discrete-time_nonlinear_multi-agent_systems_in_the_presence_of_communication_delays","305670797_Input_Delay_Compensation_in_Multi-Agent_Systems_via_Piecewise_Constant_Control","301705830_Stability_of_predictor-based_feedback_for_nonlinear_systems_with_distributed_input_delay","291389116_Consensus_of_a_class_of_second-order_nonlinear_heterogeneous_multi-agent_systems_with_uncertainty_and_communication_delay","283618753_Collaborative_Control_of_Multivehicle_Systems_in_Diverse_Motion_Patterns","283469802_Nonlinear_Predictor_Feedback_for_Input-Affine_Systems_with_Distributed_Input_Delays","264124673_Truncated_Predictor_Feedback_Stabilization_of_Polynomially_Unstable_Linear_Systems_With_Multiple_Time-Varying_Input_Delays","260661815_Output_Synchronization_on_Strongly_Connected_Graphs","259503995_Consensus_of_high-order_multi-agent_systems_with_large_input_and_communication_delays","257623802_Truncated_predictor_feedback_control_for_exponentially_unstable_linear_systems_with_time-varying_input_delay","256660744_High-order_consensus_of_heterogeneous_multi-agent_systems_with_unknown_communication_delays","256660573_Adaptive_control_scheme_for_uncertain_time-delay_systems","254054433_Compensation_of_State-Dependent_Input_Delay_for_Nonlinear_Systems","241638429_Delay_Robustness_in_Non-Identical_Multi-Agent_Systems","224236664_An_Exact_Method_for_the_Stability_Analysis_of_Linear_Consensus_Protocols_With_Time_Delay","224185031_A_General_Alignment_Repulsion_Algorithm_for_Flocking_of_Multi-Agent_Systems","224180666_Robust_Consensus_Controller_Design_for_Nonlinear_Relative_Degree_Two_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Communication_Constraints","222651931_Robust_consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_diverse_input_delays_and_asymmetric_interconnection_perturbations","222414036_Consensus_protocols_for_discrete-time_multi-agent_systems_with_time-varying_delays","47524136_Collective_motion","3029460_Linear_systems_with_delayed_controls_A_reduction","3028727_Feedback_stabilization_of_linear_systems_with_delayed_control","3023973_Limitations_of_a_class_of_stabilization_methods_for_delay_systems"]}
