{"id":"300275420_Reflection_on_Networking_Through_the_Praxeological_Lens","abstract":"In this chapter, the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD) is given a different status, its lenses and constructs being used for reflecting on the networking enterprise itself. For this purpose, the notion of praxeology first introduced for modeling mathematical and didactic activities is extended to research practices. This extension leads us to consider that the proper level for addressing networking issues is in fact the level of research praxeologies, and to reflect on the collaborative work carried out by the different teams and its outcomes in the light of this perspective. Along the way, we also rely on other constructs, and especially on the ideas of milieu and media-milieu dialectics.","authors":["Mich√®le Artigue","Marianna Bosch"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-05389-9_15","In book: Networking of Theories as a Research Practice in Mathematics Education (pp.249-265)"],"references":["306153161_Tres_modalidades_de_dialogo_entre_APOS_y_TAD_Three_modalities_of_dialogue_between_APOS_and_ATD","265583267_RESEARCH_PRAXEOLOGIES_AND_NETWORKING_THEORIES","227295195_Networking_strategies_and_methods_for_connecting_theoretical_approaches_First_steps_towards_a_conceptual_framework","227255335_Affect_in_Mathematics_Education_An_Introduction","226269524_Connecting_theories_in_mathematics_education_Challenges_and_possibilities","32231377_Integrative_theoretical_framework","286200349_Reflections_of_the_state_of_and_trends_in_research_on_mathematics_teaching_and_learning_From_here_to_utopia","266242082_The_methodology_of_scientific_research_programmes_Philosophical_papers_Vol_1_Edited_by_John_Worrall_and_Gregory_Currie","227107680_Toward_networking_three_theoretical_approaches_The_case_of_social_interactions","200026744_The_Methodology_Of_Scientific_Research_Programmes"]}
