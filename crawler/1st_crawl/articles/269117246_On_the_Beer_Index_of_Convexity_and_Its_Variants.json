{"id":"269117246_On_the_Beer_Index_of_Convexity_and_Its_Variants","abstract":"Let $S$ be a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite positive Lebesgue measure.\nThe Beer index of convexity $\\operatorname{b}(S)$ of $S$ is the probability\nthat two points of $S$ chosen uniformly independently at random see each other\nin $S$. The convexity ratio $\\operatorname{c}(S)$ of $S$ is the Lebesgue\nmeasure of the largest convex subset of $S$ divided by the Lebesgue measure of\n$S$. We investigate the relationship between these two natural measures of\nconvexity of $S$.\nWe show that every set $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ with simply connected\ncomponents satisfies $\\operatorname{b}(S)\\leq\\alpha\\operatorname{c}(S)$ for an\nabsolute constant $\\alpha$, provided $\\operatorname{b}(S)$ is defined. This\nimplies an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Cabello et al. asserting\nthat this estimate holds for simple polygons.\nWe also consider higher-order generalizations of $\\operatorname{b}(S)$. For\n$1\\leq k\\leq d$, the $k$-index of convexity $\\operatorname{b}_k(S)$ of\n$S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$ is the probability that the convex hull of a\n$(k+1)$-tuple of points chosen uniformly independently at random from $S$ is\ncontained in $S$. We show that for every $d\\geq 2$ there is a constant\n$\\beta(d)>0$ such that every set $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies\n$\\operatorname{b}_d(S)\\leq\\beta\\operatorname{c}(S)$, provided\n$\\operatorname{b}_d(S)$ exists. We provide an almost matching lower bound by\nshowing that there is a constant $\\gamma(d)>0$ such that for every\n$\\varepsilon\\in(0,1]$ there is a set $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$ of Lebesgue\nmeasure one satisfying $\\operatorname{c}(S)\\leq\\varepsilon$ and\n$\\operatorname{b}_d(S)\\geq\\gamma\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\log_2{1/\\varepsilon}}\\geq\\gamma\\frac{\\operatorname{c}(S)}{\\log_2{1/\\operatorname{c}(S)}}$.","authors":["Martin Balko","Vít Jelínek","Pavel Valtr","Bartosz Walczak"],"meta":["January 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9821-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321499863_Problem_Books_in_Mathematics","312945502_Piercing_quasi-rectangles-On_a_problem_of_Danzer_and_Rogers","285751767_Uber_eine_extremumeigenschaft_der_ellipsen","268922447_Uber_affine_Geometrie_III_Eine_Minimumeigenschaft_der_Ellipse","266434339_Elements_of_combinatorial_and_differential_topology_Transl_from_the_Russian_by_Olga_Sipacheva","262919910_Peeling_Potatoes_Near-Optimally_in_Near-Linear_Time","255180131_Real_and_Complex_Analysis","242538260_Extremum_Problems_with_Inequalities_as_Subsidiary_Conditions","242479574_Unsolved_Problems_in_Geometry","234799288_Lectures_on_Discrete_Geometry"]}
