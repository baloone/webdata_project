{"id":"341809780_Preeclampsia-like_syndrome_induced_by_severe_COVID-19_a_prospective_observational_study","abstract":"Objectives: \nTo investigate the incidence of clinical, ultrasonographic and biochemical findings related to preeclampsia (PE) in pregnancies with COVID-19, and to assess their accuracy to differentiate between PE and the PE-like features associated with COVID-19.\n\nDesign: \nA prospective, observational study.\n\nSetting: \nTertiary referral hospital.\n\nParticipants: \nSingleton pregnancies with COVID-19 at >20+0 weeks.\n\nMethods: \n42 consecutive pregnancies were recruited and classified into two groups: severe and nonsevere COVID-19, according to the occurrence of severe pneumonia. Uterine artery pulsatility index (UtAPI) and angiogenic factors (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor [sFlt-1/PlGF]) were assessed in women with suspected PE.\n\nMain outcome measures: \nIncidence of signs and symptoms related to PE, such as hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, abnormal UtAPI and increased sFlt-1/PlGF.\n\nResults: \n34 cases were classified as nonsevere and 8 as severe COVID-19. Six (14.3%) women presented signs and symptoms of PE, all six being among the severe COVID-19 cases (75.0%). However, abnormal sFlt-1/PlGF and UtAPI could only be demonstrated in one case. Two cases remained pregnant after recovery from severe pneumonia and had a spontaneous resolution of the PE-like syndrome.\n\nConclusions: \nPregnant women with severe COVID-19 can develop a PE-like syndrome that might be distinguished from actual PE by sFlt-1/PlGF, LDH and UtAPI assessment. Health care providers should be aware of its existence and monitor pregnancies with suspected preeclampsia with caution.","authors":["Manel Mendoza","Itziar Garcia‚ÄêRuiz","Nerea Maiz","Carlota Rodo"],"meta":["October 2020BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology 127(11)","DOI:10.1111/1471-0528.16339"],"references":["340627440_Characteristics_of_Liver_Tests_in_COVID-19_Patients","340510759_Angiotensin_Converting_Enzyme_2_SARS-CoV-2_Receptor_and_Regulator_of_the_Renin-Angiotensin_System","340059776_Kidney_disease_is_associated_with_in-hospital_death_of_patients_with_COVID-19","339484038_Characteristics_of_and_Important_Lessons_From_the_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Outbreak_in_China_Summary_of_a_Report_of_72_314_Cases_From_the_Chinese_Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","342941087_Clinical_management_of_severe_acute_respiratory_infection_SARI_when_COVID-19_disease_is_suspected_Interim_guidance","340679390_Hypertension_the_renin-angiotensin_system_and_the_risk_of_lower_respiratory_tract_infections_and_lung_injury_implications_for_COVID-19","340669782_The_Science_Underlying_COVID-19_Implications_for_the_Cardiovascular_System","340179709_Outcome_of_Coronavirus_spectrum_infections_SARS_MERS_COVID_1_-19_during_pregnancy_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","339902064_Thrombocytopenia_is_associated_with_severe_coronavirus_disease_2019_COVID-19_infections_A_meta-analysis","333292450_Distinctive_patterns_of_placental_lesions_in_preeclampsia_versus_fetal_growth_restriction_and_their_association_with_fetoplacental_Doppler","329757182_Clinical_usefulness_of_serum_levels_of_soluble_fms-like_tyrosine_kinase_1placental_growth_factor_ratio_to_rule_out_preeclampsia_in_women_with_new-onset_lupus_nephritis_during_pregnancy","307516774_Predictive_Value_of_the_sFlt-1_PlGF_Ratio_in_Women_With_Suspected_Preeclampsia","281292004_Association_between_adverse_pregnancy_outcome_and_imbalance_in_angiogenic_regulators_and_oxidative_stress_biomarkers_in_gestational_hypertension_and_preeclampsia","273151474_Implementation_of_the_sFlt-1PIGF_ratio_for_prediction_and_diagnosis_of_pre-eclampsia_in_singleton_pregnancy_implications_for_clinical_practice","289523833_Predictive_Value_of_the_sFlt-1PlGF_Ratio_in_Women_with_Suspected_Preeclampsia"]}
