{"id":"340067895_Reconstruction_of_bandlimited_graph_signals_from_measurements","abstract":"Graph signal reconstruction is a fundamental topic in graph signal processing. Recently, graph signal reconstruction in three typical sampling schemes has been studied in the literature. In this paper, we study the reconstruction of bandlimited graph signals in a general measurement scheme, which includes the three existing sampling scheme as its special cases. Theorems for perfect reconstruction are established, and reconstruction by random measurement matrices is studied. An iterative reconstruction algorithm based on convex projection is proposed, and numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.","authors":["Chao Huang","Qian Zhang","Jianfeng Huang","Lihua Yang"],"meta":["June 2020Digital Signal Processing 101:102728","DOI:10.1016/j.dsp.2020.102728"],"references":["320727006_Shift-Enabled_Graphs_Graphs_Where_Shift-Invariant_Filters_are_Representable_as_Polynomials_of_Shift_Operations","315795288_Greedy_Sampling_of_Graph_Signals","303496007_Kernel-Based_Reconstruction_of_Graph_Signals","283206651_How_to_learn_a_graph_from_smooth_signals","282772605_Translation_on_Graphs_An_Isometric_Shift_Operator","282604236_Sparse_Representation_on_Graphs_by_Tight_Wavelet_Frames_and_Applications","282402877_Efficient_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Bandlimited_Graph_Signals_Using_Graph_Spectral_Proxies","280630702_Signals_on_Graphs_Uncertainty_Principle_and_Sampling","279159876_Signal_Recovery_on_Graphs_Variation_Minimization","273788318_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Sampling_Theory","266971982_Local-Set-Based_Graph_Signal_Reconstruction","264950527_Poincare_and_Plancherel--Polya_Inequalities_in_Harmonic_Analysis_on_Weighted_Combinatorial_Graphs","262452360_Active_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Using_Sampling_Theory_for_Graph_Signals","262417210_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Frequency_Analysis","261344786_Signal_processing_techniques_for_interpolation_in_graph_structured_data","260849915_On_the_Sparsity_of_Wavelet_Coefficients_for_Signals_on_Graphs","260637730_Perfect_Reconstruction_Two-Channel_Wavelet_Filter_Banks_for_Graph_Structured_Data","259578340_Learning_Parametric_Dictionaries_for_Signals_on_Graphs","258794052_Tight_Wavelet_Frames_on_Multislice_Graphs","257592339_Localized_Iterative_Methods_for_Interpolation_in_Graph_Structured_Data","330813089_A_Framework_of_Adaptive_Multiscale_Wavelet_Decomposition_for_Signals_on_Undirected_Graphs","330743439_Graph_Topology_Inference_Based_on_Sparsifying_Transform_Learning","330300951_Two-Channel_Critically-Sampled_Graph_Filter_Banks_With_Spectral_Domain_Sampling","324873136_Graph_Signal_Processing_Overview_Challenges_and_Applications","318667744_Uncertainty_Principles_and_Sparse_Eigenvectors_of_Graphs","318407779_Graph_Signal_Recovery_via_Primal-Dual_Algorithms_for_Total_Variation_Minimization","316905099_Neighborhood-preserving_translations_on_graphs","312194443_Spectral_Projector-Based_Graph_Fourier_Transforms","309056030_Dual_Graph_Regularized_Dictionary_Learning","306929728_Learning_Laplacian_Matrix_in_Smooth_Graph_Signal_Representations","305909765_Interpolation_of_graph_signals_using_shift-invariant_graph_filters","303771731_Parseval_wavelets_on_hierarchical_graphs","301898279_On_the_Graph_Fourier_Transform_for_Directed_Graphs","299671386_Spectral_Graph_Theory","297256363_A_Jacobi-Davidson_iteration_method_for_linear_eigenvalue_problems","288179601_A_Multiscale_Pyramid_Transform_for_Graph_Signals","287249580_Signal_Recovery_on_Graphs_Fundamental_Limits_of_Sampling_Strategies","284096844_Random_Sampling_of_Bandlimited_Signals_on_Graphs","283761680_On_the_Shift_Operator_and_Optimal_Filtering_in_Graph_Signal_Processing","282000447_Subgraph-Based_Filterbanks_for_Graph_Signals","275280004_Sampling_of_Graph_Signals_With_Successive_Local_Aggregations","274730577_Local_Measurement_and_Reconstruction_for_Noisy_Graph_Signals","271472396_Towards_a_sampling_theorem_for_signals_on_arbitrary_graphs","264828551_Big_Data_Analysis_with_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Representation_and_processing_of_massive_data_sets_with_irregular_structure","262367630_The_Null_Space_Problem_II_Algorithms","261198375_Discrete_signal_processing_on_graphs_Graph_fourier_transform","260303032_A_Spectral_Graph_Uncertainty_Principle","258774964_A_windowed_graph_Fourier_transform","255983647_Efficient_estimation_of_eigenvalue_counts_in_an_interval","250918096_Vertex-Frequency_Analysis_on_Graphs","243026855_Removable_sets_and_approximation_of_eigenvalues_and_eigenfunctions_on_combinatorial_graphs","235903409_Bilateral_Filter_Graph_Spectral_Interpretation_and_Extensions","248508611_Image_restoration_by_the_method_of_convex_projections","244456207_Computing_a_Sparse_Basis_for_the_Null_Space","240966056_The_Null_Space_Problem_I_Complexity"]}
