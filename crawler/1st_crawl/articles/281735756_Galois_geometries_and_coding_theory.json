{"id":"281735756_Galois_geometries_and_coding_theory","abstract":"Many problems on linear codes can be retranslated into equivalent problems onspecific substructures in Galois geometries. This implies that geometrical methods canbe used to investigate problems on linear codes, and vice versa that coding-theoreticalmethods can be used to investigate problems in Galois geometries. We present in thisarticle a number of the most interesting links between linear codes and substructuresin Galois geometries. We start with some basic facts from coding theory to make thearticle self-contained. Then we present the important links between n-arcs in Galoisgeometries and linear MDS codes, minihypers and linear codes meeting the Griesmerbound, links between the extendability of linear codes and blocking sets, saturatingsets and the covering radius of linear codes, and conclude with the linear codes arisingfrom the incidence matrices of Galois geometries, illustrating their relevance forGalois geometries by giving an upper bound on the sizes of sets of points in PG(N,q)having in each of their points a tangent hyperplane.","authors":["I.
