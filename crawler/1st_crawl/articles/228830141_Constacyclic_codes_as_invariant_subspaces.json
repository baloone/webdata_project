{"id":"228830141_Constacyclic_codes_as_invariant_subspaces","abstract":"Constacyclic codes are generalizations of the familiar linear cyclic codes. In this paper constacyclic codes over a finite field F are re-garded as invariant subspaces of F n with respect to a suitable linear operator. By applying standard techniques from linear algebra one can derive properties of these codes which generalize several well-known results for cyclic codes, such as the various lower bounds for the minimum distance.","authors":["Diana Radkova","A.
