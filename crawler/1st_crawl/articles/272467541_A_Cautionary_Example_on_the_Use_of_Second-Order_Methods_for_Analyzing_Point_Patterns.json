{"id":"272467541_A_Cautionary_Example_on_the_Use_of_Second-Order_Methods_for_Analyzing_Point_Patterns","abstract":"It is not true that all important information about a pattern of points is encapsulated in its second-order description. As an example, we construct a random point process which exhibits exactly the same second-order characteristics as a Poisson process, but which differs manifestly and visibly from such a process.","authors":["A.
