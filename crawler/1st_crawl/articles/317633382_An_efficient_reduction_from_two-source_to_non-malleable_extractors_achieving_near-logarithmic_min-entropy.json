{"id":"317633382_An_efficient_reduction_from_two-source_to_non-malleable_extractors_achieving_near-logarithmic_min-entropy","abstract":"The breakthrough result of Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (2016) gives a reduction from the construction of explicit two-source extractors to the construction of explicit non-malleable extractors. However, even assuming the existence of optimal explicit non-malleable extractors only gives a two-source extractor (or a Ramsey graph) for poly(logn) entropy, rather than the optimal O(logn).\nIn this paper we modify the construction to solve the above barrier. Using the currently best explicit non-malleable extractors we get an explicit bipartite Ramsey graphs for sets of size 2k, for k=O(logn loglogn). Any further improvement in the construction of non-malleable extractors would immediately yield a corresponding two-source extractor.\nIntuitively, Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman use an extractor as a sampler, and we observe that one could use a weaker object â a somewhere-random condenser with a small entropy gap and a very short seed. We also show how to explicitly construct this weaker object using the error reduction technique of Raz, Reingold and Vadhan (1999), and the constant-degree dispersers of Zuckerman (2006) that also work against extremely small tests.","authors":["Avraham Ben-Aroya","Dean Doron","Amnon Ta-Shma"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055399.3055423","Conference: the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["234785550_Simulating_Independence_New_Constructions_of_Condensers_Ramsey_Graphs_Dispersers_and_Extractors","220618057_Extracting_Randomness_Using_Few_Independent_Sources","220138117_Simulating_Independence_New_Constructions_of_Condensers_Ramsey_Graphs_Dispersers_and_Extractors","2623134_Low_Rank_Co-Diagonal_Matrices_and_Ramsey_Graphs","313480998_Making_the_Most_of_Advice_New_Correlation_Breakers_and_Their_Applications","312294502_Extractors_for_Near_Logarithmic_Min-Entropy","312077311_Explicit_Resilient_Functions_Matching_Ajtai-Linial","303907429_Explicit_two-source_extractors_and_resilient_functions","303901311_Two-source_dispersers_for_polylogarithmic_entropy_and_improved_ramsey_graphs","284678693_Some_remarks_on_the_theory_of_graphs","281487864_Explicit_resilient_functions_matching_Ajtai-Linial","267183354_Key_Derivation_without_Entropy_Waste","267014996_The_sum-product_phenomenon_and_some_of_its_applications","266167056_A_constructive_estimation_of_the_Ramsey_number","263873453_MORE_ON_THE_SUM-PRODUCT_PHENOMENON_IN_PRIME_FIELDS_AND_ITS_APPLICATIONS","262296191_New_independent_source_extractors_with_exponential_improvement","261022135_Extractors_for_a_Constant_Number_of_Independent_Sources_with_Polylogarithmic_Min-Entropy","256157517_Lower_bounds_for_some_Ramsey_numbers","242547703_2Source_Dispersers_for_n_o1_Entropy_and_Ramsey_Graphs_Beating_the_Frankl-Wilson_Construction","227770407_A_note_on_constructive_methods_for_Ramsey_numbers","225735478_Intersection_Theorems_with_geometric_consequences","221591544_Extractors_for_a_Constant_Number_of_Polynomially_Small_Min-Entropy_Independent_Sources","221580764_Improved_Constructions_of_Two-Source_Extractors","220616999_Extractors_for_a_Constant_Number_of_Polynomially_Small_Min-Entropy_Independent_Sources","220533550_Bounds_for_Dispersers_Extractors_and_Depth-Two_Superconcentrators","220441455_The_influence_of_large_coalitions","220138633_Extractors_with_Weak_Random_Seeds","220138141_Constructing_Ramsey_Graphs_from_Boolean_Function_Representations","220137828_An_Exposition_of_Bourgain's_2-Source_Extractor","220077891_Lower_Bounds_for_Some_Ramsey_Numbers","4257925_Unbalanced_Expanders_and_Randomness_Extractors_from_Parvaresh-Vardy_Codes","3832174_Error_reduction_for_extractors","2913892_Almost_K-Wise_Independence_Versus_K-Wise_Independence","2808596_The_Shannon_Capacity_of_a_Union","2516308_Constructing_Ramsey_graphs_from_small_probability_spaces","2125457_A_Simple_Explicit_Construction_of_an_nTildeOlog_n-Ramsey_Graph"]}
