{"id":"282900218_Optimal_Codebooks_From_Binary_Codes_Meeting_the_Levenshtein_Bound","abstract":"In this paper, a generic construction of codebooks based on binary codes is introduced. With this generic construction, a few previous constructions of optimal codebooks are extended, and a new class of codebooks almost meeting the Levenshtein bound is presented. Exponentially many codebooks meeting or almost meeting the Levenshtein bound from binary codes are obtained in this paper. The codebooks constructed in this paper have alphabet size 4. As a byproduct, three bounds on the parameters of binary codes are derived.","authors":["Can Xiang","Cunsheng Ding","Sihem Mesnager"],"meta":["December 2015IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 61(12):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2015.2487451"],"references":["280445306_Packing_Lines_Planes_etc_Packings_in_Grassmannian_Space","239062924_Z4-Kerdock_Codes_Orthogonal_Spreads_and_Extremal_Euclidean_Line-Sets","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","222565757_Grassmannian_Frames_with_Applications_to_Coding_and_Communication","220680664_New_Family_of_p_-ary_Sequences_With_Optimal_Correlation_Property_and_Large_Linear_Span","220638300_Codes_Bent_Functions_and_Permutations_Suitable_For_DES-like_Cryptosystems","3079985_Binary_m-sequences_with_three-valued_crosscorrelation_A_proof_of_Welch's_conjecture","2242859_Welch's_Bound_and_Sequence_Sets_for_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Systems","2120754_New_Classes_of_Almost_Bent_and_Almost_Perfect_Nonlinear_Polynomials","285296495_Packing_in_grassmannian_spaces","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","283704481_On_Semi-bent_Functions_and_Related_Plateaued_Functions_Over_the_Galois_Field_2_n_mathbbF_2n","273395796_Binary_Linear_Codes_With_Three_Weights","273394714_New_Families_of_Codebooks_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","268167024_Codes_from_Difference_Sets","266833364_Isometric_imbeddings_of_Euclidean_spaces_into_finite_dimensional_l_p_-spaces","263094119_Several_New_Infinite_Families_of_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Duals","262416938_Near-Optimal_Partial_Hadamard_Codebook_Construction_Using_Binary_Sequences_Obtained_From_Quadratic_Residue_Mapping","260712444_New_Constructions_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_With_Equality","257765646_Bounds_for_packings_of_metric_spaces_and_some_of_their_applications","257555028_A_new_class_of_near-optimal_partial_Fourier_codebooks_from_an_almost_difference_set","256644080_Quadratic_forms_over_GF2","256391988_On_bent_functions","254061567_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Associated_With_Binary_Sequences","254056958_Two_Classes_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","239443806_Bounds_for_packing_on_a_sphere_and_in_space","235008645_Bounds_for_packings_of_metric_spaces_and_some_of_their_applications_in_Russian","222868135_The_weight_enumerators_for_several_classes_of_subcodes_of_the_2nd_order_binary_Reed-Muller_codes","222468090_Optimal_state-determination_by_mutually_unbiased_measurements","222160629_A_Proof_of_the_Welch_and_Niho_Conjectures_on_Cross-Correlations_of_Binary_m-Sequences","220686132_Bent_and_Hyper-Bent_Functions_in_Polynomial_Form_and_Their_Link_With_Some_Exponential_Sums_and_Dickson_Polynomials","220638133_Construction_of_cyclotomic_codebooks_nearly_meeting_the_Welch_bound","220532713_A_Note_on_the_Proof_of_Niho's_Conjecture","220246555_A_Class_of_Low-Rate_Nonlinear_Binary_Codes","220074811_On_Bent_Functions","200524227_Bounds_for_systems_of_lines_and_Jacobi_polynomials","200524207_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases","51932198_Hamming_Weights_in_Irreducible_Cyclic_Codes","46588039_Steiner_equiangular_tight_frames","3162278_Signal_Sets_From_Functions_With_Optimum_Nonlinearity","3086571_A_Generic_Construction_of_Complex_Codebooks_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","3085998_Complex_Codebooks_From_Combinatorial_Designs","3085429_Achieving_the_Welch_Bound_With_Difference_Sets","3084872_New_Families_of_Binary_Sequences_with_Low_Correlation","3082399_Lower_bounds_on_the_maximum_cross_correlation_of_signals_Corresp","3081312_Maximal_Recursive_Sequences_with_3-Valued_Recursive_Cross-Correlation_Functions","2670177_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_with_Equality"]}
