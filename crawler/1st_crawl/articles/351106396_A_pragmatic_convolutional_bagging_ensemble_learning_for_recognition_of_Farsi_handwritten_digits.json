{"id":"351106396_A_pragmatic_convolutional_bagging_ensemble_learning_for_recognition_of_Farsi_handwritten_digits","abstract":"Recognition of handwritten digits is one of the most important and challenging issues in recent decades in the field of computer science. Its cursive nature, the right to left writing styles of words and characters as well as various digits shapes have imposed curiosity among numerous researchers to impose a lot of efforts on the recognition of handwritten Farsi numbers. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of Farsi handwritten digit recognition, the pragmatic CBWME network structure model based on convolution bagging weighted majority ensemble learning is developed by integrating the convolution neural network (CNN) and bagging weighted majority ensemble learning. For base classifiers, we applied the VGG16, ResNet18, and Xception architectures and explored the bagging weighted majority ensemble learning in combining the base classifiers results, which are later used in identifying Farsi handwritten digits. The performance of the CNN models (VGG16, ResNet18, and Xception) and CBWME model was evaluated by comparing their results. From the experimental result analysis, it was observed that the proposed CBWME model achieved the best average recognition accuracy (97.65%), followed by the Xception model (95.9%), ResNet18 model (93.75%), and VGG16 model (90.26%) in HODA dataset. The accuracy orders were the same as in IFHCDB and CENPARMI datasets. The CSE model attained the best result with rate of (99.876%) compared with the other studies.","authors":["Y. A.
