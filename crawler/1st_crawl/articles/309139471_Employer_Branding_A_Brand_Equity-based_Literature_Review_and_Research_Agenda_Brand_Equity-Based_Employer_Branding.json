{"id":"309139471_Employer_Branding_A_Brand_Equity-based_Literature_Review_and_Research_Agenda_Brand_Equity-Based_Employer_Branding","abstract":"Over the past two decades, scholarly interest in employer branding has strongly increased. Simultaneously, however, employer branding research has developed into a fragmented field with heterogeneous interpretations of the employer branding concept and its scope, which has impeded further theoretical and empirical advancement. To strengthen the foundation for future work, this paper takes a brand equity perspective to review the extant literature and create an integrative model of employer branding. Using an analytical approach, the authors identify 187 articles, which they integrate along different employer brand dimensions and branding strategies: (i) conceptual; (ii) employer knowledge dimensions; (iii) employer branding activities and strategies. On the basis of this review, the authors develop an employer branding value chain model and derive future research avenues as well as practical implications.","authors":["Christian Theurer","Andranik Tumasjan","Isabell Welpe","Filip Lievens"],"meta":["October 2016International Journal of Management Reviews 20(1)","DOI:10.1111/ijmr.12121"],"references":["335151105_Employer-of-choice_branding_for_knowledge_workers","305397711_Job_Search_A_Multidisciplinary_Review_and_Research_Agenda","329822300_A_Survey-Based_Method_for_Measuring_and_Understanding_Brand_Equity_and_Its_Extendibility","329264131_The_Changing_Role_of_Marketing_in_the_Corporation","324998646_Corporate_Image_Recruitment_Image_And_Initial_Job_Choice_Decisions","312726328_Corporate_brand_s_What_are_they_What_of_them","309152120_Employer_Branding_Moulding_Desired_Perceptions_in_Current_and_Potential_Employees","303825146_Employer_Brand_Image_as_Predictor_of_Employee_Satisfaction_Affective_Commitment_Turnover","303733516_Great_Places_to_WorkR_Resilience_in_Times_of_Crisis","303246010_Human_Resources_Marketing_and_Recruiting_Essentials_of_Employer_Branding"]}
