Recently, progresses of computer vision and machine learning have been translated for medical imaging. Aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated ¹⁸F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (¹⁸F-FET) PET lesion detection and segmentation relying on a full 3D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\n\nMethods\nAll dynamic ¹⁸F-FET PET brain image volumes were temporally realigned to the first dynamic acquisition, coregistered and spatially normalized onto the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Ground truth segmentations were obtained using manual delineation and thresholding (1.3 x background). The volumetric CNN was implemented based on a modified Keras implementation of a U-Net library with 3 layers for the encoding and decoding paths. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as an accuracy measure of segmentation.\n\nResults\nThirty-seven patients were included (26 [70%] in the training set and 11 [30%] in the validation set). All 11 lesions were accurately detected with no false positive, resulting in a sensitivity and a specificity for the detection at the tumor level of 100%. After 150 epochs, DSC reached 0.7924 in the training set and 0.7911 in the validation set. After morphological dilatation and fixed thresholding of the predicted U-Net mask a substantial improvement of the DSC to 0.8231 (+ 4.1%) was noted. At the voxel level, this segmentation led to a 0.88 sensitivity [95% CI, 87.1 to, 88.2%] a 0.99 specificity [99.9 to 99.9%], a 0.78 positive predictive value: [76.9 to 78.3%], and a 0.99 negative predictive value [99.9 to 99.9%].\n\nConclusions\nWith relatively high performance, it was proposed the first full 3D automated procedure for segmentation of ¹⁸F-FET PET brain images of patients with different gliomas using a U-Net CNN architecture.","authors":["Paul Blanc-Durand","Axel Van der Gucht","Niklaus Schaefer","Emmanuel Itti"],"meta":["April 2018PLoS ONE 13(4):e0195798","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0195798"],"references":["319148850_O-2-18Ffluoroethyl-L-tyrosine_PET_in_gliomas_influence_of_data_processing_in_different_centres","305718082_Dynamic_O_-2-_18_F-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine_positron_emission_tomography_differentiates_brain_metastasis_recurrence_from_radiation_injury_after_radiotherapy","331601137_Correlation_of_dynamic_18_FET-PET_with_IDH_1_mutation_for_prediction_of_outcome_in_anaplastic_astrocytoma_WHO_III_independently_from_tumor_vascularisation","321794300_The_Effectiveness_of_Data_Augmentation_in_Image_Classification_using_Deep_Learning","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317720104_A_freeware_for_tumor_heterogeneity_characterization_in_PET_SPECT_CT_MRI_and_US_to_accelerate_advances_in_radiomics","315187326_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","313072928_Automatic_Liver_and_Lesion_Segmentation_in_CT_Using_Cascaded_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_3D_Conditional_Random_Fields","312873607_Classification_and_evaluation_strategies_of_auto-segmentation_approaches_for_PET_Report_of_AAPM_Task_Group_No_211","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation"]}
