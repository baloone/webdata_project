{"id":"332063022_An_Edge_Intelligence_Empowered_Recommender_System_Enabling_Cultural_Heritage_Applications","abstract":"Recommender Systems are increasingly playing an important role in our life, enabling users to find “what they need” within large data collections and supporting a variety of applications, from e-commerce to e-tourism. In this paper, we present a Big Data architecture supporting typical Cultural Heritage applications. On the top of querying, browsing and analysing cultural contents coming from distributed and heterogeneous repositories, we propose a novel user-centred recommendation strategy for cultural items suggestion. Despite centralising the processing operations within the cloud, the vision of edge intelligence has been exploited by having a mobile app (Smart Search Museum) to perform semantic searches and machine learning-based inference so as to be capable of suggesting museums, together with other items of interest, to users when they are visiting a city, exploiting jointly recommendation techniques and edge artificial intelligence facilities. Experimental results on accuracy and user satisfaction show the goodness of the proposed application.","authors":["Xin Su","Giancarlo Sperli","Vincenzo Moscato","Antonio Picariello"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2019.2908056"],"references":["321383149_Personalized_Attraction_Recommendation_System_for_Tourists_Through_Check-In_Data","317592803_User_Trends_Modeling_for_a_Content-based_Recommender_System","316285095_Big_Data_Meets_Digital_Cultural_Heritage_Design_and_Implementation_of_SCRABS_A_Smart_Context-awaRe_Browsing_Assistant_for_Cultural_EnvironmentS","314226685_A_recommendation_engine_for_travel_products_based_on_topic_sequential_patterns","271920222_Recommending_multimedia_visiting_paths_in_cultural_heritage_applications","259116994_A_Multimedia_Recommender_System","220173171_A_Survey_of_Collaborative_Filtering_Techniques","327164294_Collaborative_Dynamic_Sparse_Topic_Regression_with_User_Profile_Evolution_for_Item_Recommendation","326791597_Personalized_Recommendation_of_Tourist_Attractions_based_on_LBSN","326589690_Recommender_systems_cultural_heritage_applications_and_the_way_forward","326204896_Content-Aware_Hierarchical_Point-of-Interest_Embedding_Model_for_Successive_POI_Recommendation","323843744_Building_edge_intelligence_for_online_activity_recognition_in_service-oriented_IoT_systems","322588489_An_Ontology_for_Cultural_Heritage","319905469_A_hybrid_quantum-induced_swarm_intelligence_clustering_for_the_urban_trip_recommendation_in_smart_city","319658658_Augmented_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Sparseness_Reduction_in_Personalized_POI_Recommendation","319116883_Edge_Mesh_A_New_Paradigm_to_Enable_Distributed_Intelligence_in_Internet_of_Things","317071064_Personalized_Egocentric_Video_Summarization_of_Cultural_Tour_on_User_Preferences_Input","316020796_CHIS_A_big_data_infrastructure_to_manage_digital_cultural_items","316006668_Efficient_optimization_of_multiple_recommendation_quality_factors_according_to_individual_user_tendencies","315973761_Efficient_Keyword-Aware_Representative_Travel_Route_Recommendation","301345093_Travel_Destination_Recommendation_Based_on_Probabilistic_Spatio-temporal_Inference","294286311_Recommender_Systems_Introduction_and_Challenges","294277194_Internet_of_Things_and_Big_Data_Analytics_for_Smart_and_Connected_Communities","283667004_Smart_environments_and_Cultural_Heritage_a_novel_approach_to_create_intelligent_cultural_spaces","282794655_Data_Mining_and_Semantic_Inference_in_Cognitive_Systems","273188491_A_collaborative_user-centered_framework_for_recommending_items_in_Online_Social_Networks","266653006_SNOPS_A_smart_environment_for_cultural_heritage_applications","224346883_Cognitive_Computational_Intelligence_in_Medical_Pattern_Semantic_Understanding","220320184_A_Survey_of_Accuracy_Evaluation_Metrics_of_Recommendation_Tasks"]}
