{"id":"341680506_Detecting_Trait_versus_Performance_Student_Behavioral_Patterns_Using_Discriminative_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that students follow stable behav-ioral patterns while learning in online educational systems. These behavioral patterns can further be used to group the students into different clusters. However, as these clusters include both high-and low-performance students, the relation between the behavioral patterns and student performance is yet to be clarified. In this work, we study the relationship between students' learning behaviors and their performance, in a self-organized online learning system that allows them to freely practice with various problems and worked examples. We represent each student's behavior as a vector of high-support sequential micro-patterns. Then, we discover both the prevalent behavioral patterns in each group and the shared patterns across groups using discriminative non-negative matrix factorization. Our experiments show that we can successfully detect such common and specific patterns in students' behavior that can be further interpreted into student learning behavior trait patterns and performance patterns.","authors":["Mehrdad Mirzaei","Shaghayegh Sahebi","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["May 2020","Conference: The 33rd International FLAIRS ConferenceAt: North Miami Beach, Florida, USA","Project: Modeling Students' Behavior Using Sequential Patterns"],"references":["333327669_Educational_data_mining_for_discovering_hidden_browsing_patterns_using_non-negative_matrix_factorization","333076578_Iterative_Discriminant_Tensor_Factorization_for_Behavior_Comparison_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","332427502_What_will_you_do_next_A_sequence_analysis_on_the_student_transitions_between_online_platforms_in_blended_courses","307168000_Survival_Analysis_based_Framework_for_Early_Prediction_of_Student_Dropouts","299970755_Simultaneous_Discovery_of_Common_and_Discriminative_Topics_via_Joint_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","283556247_Beyond_Prediction_First_Steps_Toward_Automatic_Intervention_in_MOOC_Student_Stopout","313865198_Learning_analytics_to_unveil_learning_strategies_in_a_flipped_classroom","306281778_Tensor_Factorization_for_Student_Modeling_and_Performance_Prediction_in_Unstructured_Domain","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","295075075_Transfer_Learning_for_Predictive_Models_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses"]}
