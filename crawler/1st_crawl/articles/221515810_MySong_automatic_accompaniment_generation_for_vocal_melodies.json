{"id":"221515810_MySong_automatic_accompaniment_generation_for_vocal_melodies","abstract":"We introduce MySong, a system that automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody. A user with no musical experience can create a song with instrumental accompaniment just by singing into a microphone, and can experiment with different styles and chord patterns using interactions designed to be intuitive to non-musicians. We describe the implementation of MySong, which trains a Hidden Markov Model using a music database and uses that model to select chords for new melodies. Model parameters are intuitively exposed to the user. We present results from a study demonstrating that chords assigned to melodies using MySong and chords assigned manually by musicians receive similar subjective ratings. We then present results from a second study showing that thirteen users with no background in music theory are able to rapidly create musical accompaniments using MySong, and that these accompaniments are rated positively by evaluators.","authors":["Ian Simon","Dan Morris","Sumit Basu"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1145/1357054.1357169","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2008, 2008, Florence, Italy, April 5-10, 2008"],"references":["234784461_An_intelligent_hybrid_model_for_chord_prediction","228716894_Robust_Polyphonic_Midi_Score_Following_with_Hidden_Markov_Models","228698591_A_hybrid_system_for_automatic_generation_of_style-specific_accompaniment","221603308_Modeling_Form_for_On-line_Following_of_Musical_Performances","200806162_A_Stochastic_Method_of_Tracking_a_Vocal_Performer","2326829_Accurate_Short-Term_Analysis_Of_The_Fundamental_Frequency_And_The_Harmonics-To-Noise_Ratio_Of_A_Sampled_Sound","2237549_Tuning_a_Neural_Network_for_Harmonizing_Melodies_in_Real-Time","282055455_Score_Following_Using_Spectral_Analysis_and_Hidden_Markov_Models","248590963_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications","248590253_A_Pattern_-_Based_Software_Framework_for_Computer_Aided_Jazz_Improvisation","240445232_coJIVE_A_System_to_Support_Collaborative_Jazz_Improvisation","240054541_PhD_Thesis_Interconnected_Musical_Networks_-_Bringing_Expression_and_Thoughtfulness_to_Collaborative_Music_Making","236157558_The_Viterbi_algorithm","235890211_The_Viterbi_algorithm","221572898_A_flexible_system_for_creating_music_while_interacting_with_the_computer","221442172_Probabilistic_Melodic_Harmonization","200806284_A_Hybrid_Graphical_Model_for_Aligning_Polyphonic_Audio_with_Musical_Scores","8329679_Hyperscore_A_Graphical_Sketchpad_for_Novice_Composers"]}
