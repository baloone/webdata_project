Original research/innovation reports describing intervention(s) for UG/PG medical learners with academic difficulties were included. Data extraction employed Michie’s Behavior Change Techniques (BCT) Taxonomy and program evaluation models from Stufflebeam and Kirkpatrick. Quality appraisal used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The authors synthesized extracted evidence by adapting the GRADE approach to formulate recommendations.\nResults: Sixty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria, most commonly addressing knowledge (66.2%), skills (53.9%) and attitudinal problems (26.2%), or learner personal issues (41.5%). The most common BCTs were Shaping knowledge, Feedback/monitoring, and Repetition/substitution. Quality appraisal was variable (MMAT 0–100%). A thematic content analysis identified 109 interventions (UG: n = 84, PG: n = 58), providing 24 strong, 48 moderate, 26 weak and 11 very weak recommendations.\nConclusion: This review provides a repertoire of literature-based interventions for teaching/learning, faculty development, and research purposes.","authors":["Miriam Lacasse","Marie-Claude Audétat","Elisabeth Boileau","Nathalie caire
