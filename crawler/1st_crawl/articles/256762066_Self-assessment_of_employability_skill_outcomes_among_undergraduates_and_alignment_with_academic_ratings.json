{"id":"256762066_Self-assessment_of_employability_skill_outcomes_among_undergraduates_and_alignment_with_academic_ratings","abstract":"Despite acknowledgement of the benefits of self-assessment in higher education, disparity between student and academic assessments, with associated trends in overrating and underrating, plagues its meaningful use, particularly as a tool for formal assessment. This study examines self-assessment of capabilities in certain employability skills in more than 1000 Australian business undergraduates. It evaluates the extent to which student self-assessments differ from academics, in what ways and the influence of certain individual and background characteristics – such as stage of degree, gender and academic ability – on rating accuracy. Explanations for documented disparities are presented, in addition to implications and strategies for educators.","authors":["Denise Jackson"],"meta":["March 2013Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education 39(1)","DOI:10.1080/02602938.2013.792107"],"references":["311469451_A_comparison_of_direct_versus_self-report_measures_for_assessing_physical_activity_in_adults_A_systematic_review","267951559_A_Reflection_on_the_Introduction_of_a_Peer_and_Self_Assessment_Initiative","324998594_Self-Assessment_of_Knowledge_A_Cognitive_Learning_or_Affective_Measure","321245405_Self-Assessment_in_Medical_Practice","307770349_Effects_of_Recurring_Use_of_Self-Assessment_in_University_Courses","298027908_ChE_at_The_university_of_Arizona","292798781_A_framework_for_developing_and_assessing_generic_capabilities_in_QUT_law_graduates","288941461_Implementing_student_self_assessment","273213891_Self-Assessment_of_Knowledge_A_Cognitive_Learning_or_Affective_Measure","270585316_Are_they_ready_to_work_Employers'_perspectives_on_the_basic_knowledge_and_applied_skills_of_new_entrants_to_the_21st_century_US_workforce"]}
