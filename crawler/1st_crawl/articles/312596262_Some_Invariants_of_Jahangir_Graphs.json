{"id":"312596262_Some_Invariants_of_Jahangir_Graphs","abstract":"In this report, we compute closed forms of M-polynomial, first and second Zagreb polynomials and forgotten polynomial for Jahangir graphs Jn,m for all values of m and n. From the M-polynomial, we recover many degree-based topological indices such as first and second Zagreb indices, modified Zagreb index, Symmetric division index, etc. We also compute harmonic index, first and second multiple Zagreb indices and forgotten index of Jahangir graphs. Our results are extensions of many existing results","authors":["Mobeen Munir","Waqas Nazeer","Shin Min Kang","Muhammad Imran Qureshi"],"meta":["January 2017Symmetry 9(1)","DOI:10.3390/sym9010017"],"references":["312023559_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Boron_Triangular_Nanotubes","311455848_M-Polynomial_and_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Polyhex_Nanotubes","310606373_Some_Invariants_of_Circulant_Graphs","308490742_M-Polynomial_and_Related_Topological_Indices_of_Nanostar_Dendrimers","304789076_The_Wiener_Index_and_the_Hosoya_Polynomial_of_the_Jahangir_Graphs_149","282704814_Hosoya_Polynomial_and_Wiener_Index_of_Jahangir_graphs_J2m_99","280136936_The_Zagreb_Indices_30_Years_After","313603847_Some_properties_of_the_second_Zagreb_index","297708702_The_hyper-Zagreb_index_of_graph_operations","285380950_Some_properties_of_the_Wiener_polynomial","267081398_On_history_of_the_Randic_index_and_emerging_hostility_toward_chemical_graph_theory","267057070_Mathematical_Aspects_of_Randic-Type_Molecular_Structure_Descriptors","266612433_Note_on_multiple_Zagreb_indices","266236412_Augmented_Zagreb_Index_of_Connected_Graphs","265357376_Graphs_of_extremal_weights"]}
