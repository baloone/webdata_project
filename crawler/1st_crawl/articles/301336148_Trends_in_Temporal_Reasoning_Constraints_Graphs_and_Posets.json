{"id":"301336148_Trends_in_Temporal_Reasoning_Constraints_Graphs_and_Posets","abstract":"Temporal reasoning finds many applications in numerous fields of artificial intelligence – frameworks for representing and analyzing temporal information are therefore important. Allen’s interval algebra is a calculus for temporal reasoning that was introduced in 1983. Reasoning with qualitative time in Allen’s full interval algebra is NP-complete. Research since 1995 identified maximal tractable subclasses of this algebra via exhaustive computer search and also other ad-hoc methods. In 2003, the full classification of complexity for satisfiability problems over constraints in Allen’s interval algebra was established algebraically. We review temporal reasoning concepts including a method for deciding tractability of temporal constraint satisfaction problems based on the theory of algebraic closure operators for constraints. Graph-based temporal representations such as interval and sequence graphs are discussed. We also propose novel research for scheduling algorithms based on the Fishburn-Shepp inequality for posets.","authors":["Jacqueline W.
