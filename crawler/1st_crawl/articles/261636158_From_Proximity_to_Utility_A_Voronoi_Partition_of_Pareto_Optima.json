{"id":"261636158_From_Proximity_to_Utility_A_Voronoi_Partition_of_Pareto_Optima","abstract":"We present an extension of Voronoi diagrams where not only the distance to\nthe site is taken into account when considering which site the client is going\nto use, but additional attributes (i.e., prices) are also considered. A cell in\nthis diagram is then the locus of all points (i.e. clients) that consider the\nsame set of sites to be relevant. In particular, the precise site a client\nmight use from this candidate set depends on parameters that might change\nbetween usages, and the candidate set lists all of the relevant sites. The\nresulting diagram is significantly more expressive than Voronoi diagrams, but\nnaturally has the drawback that its complexity, even in the plane, might be\nquite high.\nNevertheless, we show that if the attributes of the sites are drawn from the\nsame distribution (note that the locations are fixed), then the expected\ncomplexity of the candidate diagram is near linear. To derive this result, we\nderive several new technical results, which are of independent interest.","authors":["Hsien-Chih Chang","Sariel Har-Peled","Benjamin Raichel"],"meta":["October 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9808-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["312273659_Welfare_Economics","269007865_Stochastic_Geometry","267147479_Geometric_Approximation_Algorithms","265716851_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_Delaunay_Triangulations","263979713_A_SIMPLE_ON-LINE_RANDOMIZED_INCREMENTAL_ALGORITHM_FOR_COMPUTING_HIGHER_ORDER_VORONOI_DIAGRAMS","262153258_Nearest_neighbor_searching_under_uncertainty_II","259584730_On_the_Complexity_of_Randomly_Weighted_Voronoi_Diagrams","258083031_Union_of_Random_Minkowski_Sums_and_Network_Vulnerability_Analysis","247039497_On_the_Expected_Number_of_k-sets_of_Coordinate-Wise_Independent_Points","238727860_On_the_variance_of_random_polytopes"]}
