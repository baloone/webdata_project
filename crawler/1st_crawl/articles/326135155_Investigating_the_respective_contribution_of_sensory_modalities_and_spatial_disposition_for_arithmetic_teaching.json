{"id":"326135155_Investigating_the_respective_contribution_of_sensory_modalities_and_spatial_disposition_for_arithmetic_teaching","abstract":"Recent studies suggested that multisensory training schemes could boost the development of abstract concepts. In the present study, we wanted to evaluate whether training arithmetic with a multisensory intervention could induce larger learning improvements than a visual intervention alone. Moreover, as a left-to-right oriented mental number line was for a long time considered as a core feature of numerical representation, we also wanted to compare left-to-right and non-linear arithmetic training. In order to do so, kindergarten children were trained to solve simple addition and subtraction operations. Four training-conditions were created according to two factors: the perceptual modalities (multisensory vs. visual) and the spatial disposition of the materials used (linear vs. non-linear). While the effect of spatial disposition was not highlighted in the arithmetic task, the multisensory training method induced a larger improvement of arithmetic performance as compared to the visual training alone. These results support the idea that haptic manipulation provides a bridge between concrete referents and abstract concepts.","authors":["Virginie Crollen","Marie-Pascale Noel","Nastasya
