{"id":"301879511_Some_results_on_chromatic_number_as_a_function_of_the_number_of_triangles","abstract":"A variety of powerful results have been shown for the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs; typically, this can be bounded much more strongly than is possible for arbitrary graphs. Three noteworthy bounds are in terms of the number of vertices, edges, and maximum degree given by Nilli, Gimbel \\& Thomassen, and Johansson. There have been comparatively fewer works extending these types of bounds to graphs with relatively few, but non-zero, number of triangles. In this paper, we address this gap by showing comparable upper bounds for $\\chi(G)$ as a function of the number of vertices $n$, the number of edges $m$, as well as the triangle count. Our results smoothly interpolate between the generic bounds true for all graphs and bounds for triangle-free graphs. We study three measures of triangle count: the total number of triangles, the number of triangles incident to any edge, and the number of triangles incident to any vertex. Our results are tight for most of these cases.","authors":["David G.
