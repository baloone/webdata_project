{"id":"276166483_Building_Information_Modeling_BIM_Trends_Benefits_Risks_and_Challenges_for_the_AEC_Industry","abstract":"Building information modeling (BIM) is one of the most promising recent developments in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a building is digitally constructed. This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, construction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects.","authors":["Salman Azhar"],"meta":["July 2011Leadership and Management in Engineering 11(3):241-252","DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"],"references":["302924419_BIM_Handbook_A_Guide_to_Building_Information_Modeling_For_Owners","283118367_Building_Information_Modeling_BIM_A_New_Paradigm_for_Visual_Interactive_Modeling_and_Simulation_for_Construction_Projects","251838984_IPD_and_BIM_Benefits_and_Opportunities_for_Regulatory_Agencies","237569739_Building_Information_Modeling_BIM_Benefits_Risks_and_Challenges","312368925_BIM_and_Construction_Management_Proven_Tools","312368271_BIM_Handbook_A_Guide_to_Building_Information_Modeling_for_Owners_Managers_Designers","302415237_From_building_information_modeling_to_city_information_modeling","292717967_BIM's_return_on_investment","288963575_Building_information_modeling","241979482_Virtual_building_environments_VBE_-_Applying_information_modeling_to_buildings","27483945_Adopting_BIM_for_Facilities_Adopting_BIM_for_Facilities_Management_Solutions_for_Managing_the_Sydney_Opera_House"]}
