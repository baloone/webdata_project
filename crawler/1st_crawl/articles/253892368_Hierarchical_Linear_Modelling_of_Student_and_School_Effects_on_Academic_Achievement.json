{"id":"253892368_Hierarchical_Linear_Modelling_of_Student_and_School_Effects_on_Academic_Achievement","abstract":"Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) and data from the New Brunswick School Climate Study were used to examine student background, school context, and school climate effects on Grade 6 student achievement in mathematics, science, reading, and writing. Gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and Native ethnicity were significant predictors of academic achievement. Schools showed the smallest variation in reading, the largest in mathematics. School mean SES was significant in mathematics, reading, and writing achievement, as was disciplinary climate in mathematics, science, and writing. School size and parental involvement significantly affected only the relationship between mathematics achievement and individual SES.","authors":["Xin Ma","Don Klinger"],"meta":["January 2000Canadian Journal of Education / Revue canadienne de l Ã©ducation 25(1)","DOI:10.2307/1585867"],"references":["271945650_The_Effect_of_School_Population_Socioeconomic_Status_on_Individual_Student_Academic_Achievement","300939986_Schooling_and_Achievement_Additive_versus_Interactive_Models","289963865_Hierarchical_linear_models_2nd_ed","284690867_The_effect_of_parental_involvement_on_the_achievement_of_eighth_grade_students","277154634_REVIEW_OF_RESEARCH_ON_EFFECTIVE_SCHOOLS","276948151_Family_Structure_School_Context_and_Eighth-Grade_Math_and_Reading_Achievement","275700829_Rethinking_Gender_Differences_in_Literacy","272971369_Schools_Classrooms_and_Pupils_International_Studies_of_Schooling_from_a_Multilevel_Perspective","272559951_The_School_Compositional_Effect_of_Single_Parenthood_on_10th-Grade_Achievement","270366719_Data_Analysis_and_REgression"]}
