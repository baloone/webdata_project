{"id":"330996294_Double_Serial_Adaptation_Mechanism_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Authentication_based_on_a_Single_Password","abstract":"Cyber-attacks have spread all over the world to steal information such as trade secrets, intellectual property and banking data. Facing the danger of the insecurity of saved data (personal, professional, official, etc.), keystroke dynamics was proposed as an interesting, non-intrusive, inexpensive, permanent and weakly constrained solution for users. Based on the typing rhythm of users, it improves logical access security. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that such an authentication mechanism would need a larger number of samples to enroll the typing characteristics of users. Moreover, these registered characteristics generally undergo aging effects after a time span. Different solutions have been suggested to remedy these variability problems, including template adaptation. In this paper, we propose a double serial adaptation strategy that considers a single-capture-based enrollment process. When using the authentication system, the template of users and the decision/adaptation thresholds are updated. Experimental results on three public keystroke dynamics datasets show the benefits of the proposed method.","authors":["Abir Mhenni","Estelle Cherrier","Christophe Rosenberger","Najoua ESSOUKRI BEN AMARA"],"meta":["February 2019Computers & Security 83(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.cose.2019.02.002"],"references":["329184422_User_Dependent_Template_Update_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Recognition","326942813_Adaptive_Biometric_Strategy_using_Doddington_Zoo_Classification_of_User's_Keystroke_Dynamics","325909183_Towards_a_Secured_Authentication_Based_on_an_Online_Double_Serial_Adaptive_Mechanism_of_Users'_Keystroke_Dynamics","327194247_Cross_Keyboard_Keystroke_Dynamics","322810044_Sensitivity_analysis_in_keystroke_dynamics_using_convolutional_neural_networks","317639950_Anatomy_of_secondary_features_in_keystroke_dynamics_-_achieving_more_with_less","317639742_Transfer_learning_in_long-text_keystroke_dynamics","315325881_A_combined_watermarking_approach_for_securing_biometric_data","311894603_Adaptive_techniques_for_intra-user_variability_in_keystroke_dynamics","309531048_Application_of_recurrent_neural_networks_for_user_verification_based_on_keystroke_dynamics"]}
