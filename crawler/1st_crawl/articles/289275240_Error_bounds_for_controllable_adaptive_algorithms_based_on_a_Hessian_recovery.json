{"id":"289275240_Error_bounds_for_controllable_adaptive_algorithms_based_on_a_Hessian_recovery","abstract":"One of the main goals of adaptive algorithms for unstructured mesh generation is to obtain a better discretization error with the use of the least possible number of mesh cells. For many problems, the discretization error can be bounded above by the interpolation error. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the interpolation error for controllable adaptive algorithms based on a Hessian recovery.","authors":["Yuri Vassilevski","K.N.
