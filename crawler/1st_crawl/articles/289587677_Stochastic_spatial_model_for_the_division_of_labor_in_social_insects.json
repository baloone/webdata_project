{"id":"289587677_Stochastic_spatial_model_for_the_division_of_labor_in_social_insects","abstract":"Motivated by the study of social insects, we introduce a stochastic model\nbased on interacting particle systems in order to understand the effect of\ncommunication on the division of labor. Members of the colony are located on\nthe vertex set of a graph representing a communication network. They are\ncharacterized by one of two possible tasks, which they update at a rate equal\nto the cost of the task they are performing by either defecting by switching to\nthe other task or cooperating by anti-imitating a random neighbor in order to\nbalance the amount of energy spent in each task. We prove that, at least when\nthe probability of defection is small, the division of labor is poor when there\nis no communication, better when the communication network consists of a\ncomplete graph, but optimal on bipartite graphs with bipartite sets of equal\nsize, even when both tasks have very different costs. This shows a\nnon-monotonic relationship between the number of connections in the\ncommunication network and how well individuals organize themselves to\naccomplish both tasks equally.","authors":["Alesandro Arcuri","Nicolas Lanchier"],"meta":["January 2016Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences 27(1)","DOI:10.1142/S0218202517400024","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265966126_Fixation_in_the_one-dimensional_Axelrod_model","258442413_Further_results_on_consensus_formation_in_the_Deffuant_model","238879566_Traffic_crowds_and_swarms","236955177_Rumor_Processes_in_Random_Environment_on_N_and_on_Galton-Watson_Trees","235737446_Mixing_Beliefs_Among_Interacting_Agents","234017918_Stochastic_Dynamics_on_Hypergraphs_and_the_Spatial_Majority_Rule_Model","230860012_Mathematical_Modeling_of_Collective_Behavior_in_Socio-Economic_and_Life_Sciences","226962473_Effects_of_social_group_size_on_information_transfer_and_task_allocation","45909885_The_Axelrod_model_for_the_dissemination_of_culture_revisited","38360673_Fixation_Results_for_Threshold_Voter_Systems","38357317_Kinetic_models_of_opinion_formation","323080137_A_model_for_spatial_conflict","321610881_Generalized_Collocation_Methods_Solutions_to_Nonlinear_Problems","310439806_Ten_lectures_on_particle_systems","305973815_Rumor_Processes_on_N","281230388_Caste_and_division_of_labor_in_leaf-cutter_ants_Hymenoptera_Formicidae_Atta_-_II_The_ergonomic_optimization_of_leaf_cutting","279957934_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","278733379_Stochastic_Evolving_Differential_Games_Toward_a_Systems_Theory_of_Behavioral_Social_Dynamics","266221490_Stochastic_interacting_systems_Contact_voter_and_exclusion_processes","265696065_Nonlinear_Voter_Models","263621402_ON_THE_MATHEMATICAL_THEORY_OF_THE_DYNAMICS_OF_SWARMS_VIEWED_AS_COMPLEX_SYSTEMS","261476490_The_Insect_Societies","257507060_A_Pairwise_Averaging_Procedure_with_Application_to_Consensus_Formation_in_the_Deffuant_Model","254212708_A_lecture_on_the_averaging_process","244508528_Axelrod_R_The_Dissemination_of_Culture_A_Model_with_Local_Convergence_and_Global_Polarization_Journal_of_Conflict_Resolution_41_203-226","242912991_On_the_Distribution_of_Dominance_in_Populations_of_Social_Organisms","240503229_Nearest-neighbor_Markov_interaction_processes_on_multidimensional_lattices1","240053444_Interacting_Particle_Systems","236628834_Caste_and_division_of_labor_in_leaf-cutter_ants_Hymenoptera_Formicidae_Atta_-_I_The_overall_pattern_in_A_sexdens","224010824_First-order_macroscopic_modelling_of_human_crowd_dynamics","224010767_From_discrete_kinetic_and_stochastic_game_theory_to_modelling_complex_systems_in_applied_sciences","224010765_On_the_existence_of_limit_cycles_in_opinion_formation_processes_under_time_periodic_influence_of_persuaders","224010753_On_the_modelling_crowd_dynamics_from_scaling_to_hyperbolic_macroscopic_models","224010705_Towards_a_mathematical_theory_of_complex_socio-economical_systems_by_functional_subsystems_representation","223650407_A_parallel_distributed_model_of_ant_colony_behaviour","223636125_Clustering_in_one-dimensional_threshold_voter_models","222294304_Limit_theorems_for_the_spread_of_epidemics_and_forest_fires","51918130_Consensus_in_the_two-state_Axelrod_model","38363006_Epidemics_with_Recovery_in_D_2","38362464_Ergodic_Theorems_for_Weakly_Interacting_Infinite_Systems_and_the_Voter_Model","38362265_Ergodicity_Conditions_for_a_Dissonant_Voting_Model","38362065_Renormalizing_the_3-Dimensional_Voter_Model","38361982_Clustering_and_Dispersion_Rates_for_Some_Interacting_Particle_Systems_on_mathbbZ","38361607_Occupation_Time_Limit_Theorems_for_the_Voter_Model","38361375_Diffusive_Clustering_in_the_Two_Dimensional_Voter_Model","38360539_Coexistence_in_Threshold_Voter_Models","38351277_Renormalization_of_the_Voter_Model_in_Equilibrium","31081993_A_Model_for_Spatial_Conflict","12216325_Models_of_division_of_labor_in_social_insects","2110367_The_spread_of_a_rumor_or_infection_in_a_moving_population","1914884_Sociophysics_A_review_of_Galam_models","1770779_Statistical_physics_of_social_dynamics","1767763_Continuum_limit_of_self-driven_particles_with_orientation_interaction"]}
