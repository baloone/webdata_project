{"id":"337301984_Free_energy_of_a_general_computation","abstract":"Starting from Landauer's slogan “information is physical,” we revise and modify Landauer's principle stating that the erasure of information has a minimal price in the form of a certain quantity of free energy. We establish a direct link between the erasure cost and the work value of a piece of information and show that the former is essentially the length of the string's best compression by a reversible computation. We generalize the principle by deriving bounds on the free energy to be invested for—or gained from, for that matter—a general computation. We then revisit the second law of thermodynamics and compactly rephrase it (assuming the Church-Turing-Deutsch hypothesis that physical reality can be simulated by a universal Turing machine): Time evolutions are logically reversible—“the future fully remembers the past (but not necessarily vice versa).” We link this view to previous formulations of the second law, and we argue that it has a particular feature that suggests its “logico-informational” nature, namely, simulation resilience: If a computation faithfully simulates a physical process violating the law, then that very computation procedure violates it as well.","authors":["Ämin Baumeler","Stefan Wolf"],"meta":["November 2019PHYSICAL REVIEW E 100(5)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.100.052115"],"references":["326825284_Thermodynamics_of_Modularity_Structural_Costs_Beyond_the_Landauer_Bound","280031298_The_minimal_work_cost_of_information_processing","256091412_Information_Processing_and_the_Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_An_Inclusive_Hamiltonian_Approach","231143202_Inadequacy_of_von_Neumann_entropy_for_characterizing_extractable_work","51187650_The_thermodynamic_meaning_of_negative_entropy","2185806_The_physics_of_forgetting_Landauer's_erasure_principle_and_information_theory","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","309738593_Relations_Between_Work_and_Entropy_Production_for_General_Information-Driven_Finite-State_Engines","277334463_Non-Locality_Without_Counterfactual_Reasoning","237005437_Three_Approaches_to_the_Quantitative_Definition_of_Information","233873450_Fluctuation_Theorem_with_Information_Exchange_Role_of_Correlations_in_Stochastic_Thermodynamics","228109498_Quantum_generalizations_of_Bell's_inequality","226418586_Conservative_Logic","226112338_The_thermodynamics_of_computation---a_review","226096736_Quantum_nonlocality_as_an_axiom","225857514_uber_die_Entropieverminderung_in_einem_thermodynamischen_System_bei_Eingriffen_intelligenter_Wesen","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","222834949_Notes_on_Landauer's_Principle_Reversible_Computation_and_Maxwell's_Demon","51955001_Free_randomness_can_be_amplified","23602220_Thermodynamic_cost_of_computation_algorithmic_complexity_and_the_information_metric","13385853_Algorithmic_randomness_and_entropy","7668954_No_Signaling_and_Quantum_Key_Distribution","3083116_Compression_of_Individual_Sequences_Via_Variable-Rate_Coding","2770671_A_Theory_Of_Program_Size_Formally_Identical_To_Information_Theory"]}
