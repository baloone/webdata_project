{"id":"312473550_Software_Engineering_for_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"No consolidated set of software engineering best practices for the Internet of Things (IoT) has yet emerged. Too often, the landscape resembles the Wild West, with unprepared programmers putting together IoT systems in ad hoc fashion and throwing them out into the market, often poorly tested. In addition, the academic sector is in danger of fragmenting into specialized, often unrelated research areas. This IEEE Software theme issue aims to help provide the basis for a set of best practices that will guide the industry through the challenges of software engineering for the IoT","authors":["Xabier Larrucea","Annie Combelles","John Favaro","Kunal Taneja"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Software 34(1)","DOI:10.1109/MS.2017.28"],"references":["281333084_Service_Composition_for_IP_Smart_Object_using_Realtime_Web_Protocols_Concept_and_Research_Challenges","264589945_Research_Directions_for_the_Internet_of_Things","228729073_Opportunities_and_Obligations_for_Physical_Computing_Systems","221091477_IP_is_dead_long_live_IP_for_wireless_sensor_networks","220706120_Supporting_interaction_with_the_Internet_of_Things_across_objects_time_and_space","283036979_A_Security_Gateway_Application_for_End-to-End_M2M_Communications","277349630_Customer_Quality_Improvement_of_Software_Systems","272392761_Debugging_the_Internet_of_Things_The_Case_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220709764_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_WSN_and_Internet_of_Things_IOT","51725727_The_platelet_and_its_challenges"]}
