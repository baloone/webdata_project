{"id":"295803361_A_new_deterministic_RSA-factoring_algorithm","abstract":"The security of many cryptography techniques depends upon the intractability of the integer-factoring problem. However, in the recent years there has been a great deal of progress in the art of factoring, relaying mostly on non-deterministic methods. This research proposes a new deterministic factoring algorithm, that factors RSA n = p * q, the algorithm running time relays on the number of digits of n rather than the value of n. The nature of the problem of factoring based on time, complexity and storage required. The proposed algorithm works on solving these problems by using the idea of long multiplication to limit the possible values of p and q. In order to eliminate the storage problem, depth-first search was used with recursive implementation. In addition, the paper discussed the analysis of the proposed algorithm with their running time and complexity. Finally, the paper concludes with future work improvements to the algorithm.","authors":["Sattar J.
