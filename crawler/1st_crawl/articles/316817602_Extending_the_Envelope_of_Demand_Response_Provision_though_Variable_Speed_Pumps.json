{"id":"316817602_Extending_the_Envelope_of_Demand_Response_Provision_though_Variable_Speed_Pumps","abstract":"Changes in power generation and supply and changes in water distribution systems are creating new opportunities for water utilities to enhance operational efficiency and income through the use of advanced control and optimisation. First, the increase in renewables penetration into the grid is causing a growth in energy storage schemes. Second, variable speed pumps are now fitted to most new systems and many existing water distribution systems are being retrofitted with variable speed pumps to improve the efficiency of the operation. We study how these trends can be jointly exploited to provide energy storage from a water distribution system. We investigate how variable speed drive pumps can enhance the ability of a water distribution network to provide demand response energy to the grid. We show that demand response provision from water distribution systems can be improved through the use of variable speed pumps. We also demonstrate that a network equipped with variable speed pumps can provide demand response profitably across a wider range of operating scenarios compared to a network equipped with only fixed-speed pumps. The results highlight another potential benefit of variable speed pumps in water distribution systems.","authors":["R. Menke","Edo Abraham","P.
