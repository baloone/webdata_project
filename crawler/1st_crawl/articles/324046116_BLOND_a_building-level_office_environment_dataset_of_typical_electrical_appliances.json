{"id":"324046116_BLOND_a_building-level_office_environment_dataset_of_typical_electrical_appliances","abstract":"Energy metering has gained popularity as conventional meters are replaced by electronic smart meters that promise energy savings and higher comfort levels for occupants. Achieving these goals requires a deeper understanding of consumption patterns to reduce the energy footprint: load profile forecasting, power disaggregation, appliance identification, startup event detection, etc. Publicly available datasets are used to test, verify, and benchmark possible solutions to these problems. For this purpose, we present the BLOND dataset: continuous energy measurements of a typical office environment at high sampling rates with common appliances and load profiles. We provide voltage and current readings for aggregated circuits and matching fully-labeled ground truth data (individual appliance measurements). The dataset contains 53 appliances (16 classes) in a 3-phase power grid. BLOND-50 contains 213 days of measurements sampled at 50kSps (aggregate) and 6.4kSps (individual appliances). BLOND-250 consists of the same setup: 50 days, 250kSps (aggregate), 50kSps (individual appliances). These are the longest continuous measurements at such high sampling rates and fully-labeled ground truth we are aware of.","authors":["Thomas Kriechbaumer","Hans-Arno Jacobsen"],"meta":["March 2018Scientific Data 5(1):180048","DOI:10.1038/sdata.2018.48"],"references":["321431889_Static_energy_meter_errors_caused_by_conducted_electromagnetic_interference","312267812_An_electrical_load_measurements_dataset_of_United_Kingdom_households_from_a_two-year_longitudinal_study","303828777_Electricity_water_and_natural_gas_consumption_of_a_residential_house_in_Canada_from_2012_to_2014","317055535_A_Comprehensive_Feature_Study_for_Appliance_Recognition_on_High_Frequency_Energy_Data","317051078_MEDAL_A_Cost-Effective_High-Frequency_Energy_Data_Acquisition_System_for_Electrical_Appliances","316907588_CLEAR_-_A_circuit_level_electric_appliance_radar_for_the_electric_cabinet","312749803_BLUED_A_fully_labeled_public_dataset_for_event-based_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_research","309640672_BOLT_Energy_Disaggregation_by_Online_Binary_Matrix_Factorization_of_Current_Waveforms","286933540_Building_DC_Microgrids_-_Planning_of_an_Experimental_Platform_with_Power_Hardware_in_the_Loop_Features","284689750_Blued_A_fully_labeled_public_dataset_for_event-based_non-intrusive_load_monitoring_research"]}
