{"id":"331039753_How_Much_Do_You_Have_to_Publish_to_Get_a_Job_in_a_Top_Sociology_Department_Or_to_Get_Tenure_Trends_over_a_Generation","abstract":"Many sociologists suspect that publication expectations have risen over time—that how much graduate students have published to get assistant professor jobs and how much assistant professors have published to be promoted have gone up. Using information about faculty in 21 top sociology departments from the American Sociological Association’s Guide to Graduate Departments of Sociology, online curricula vitae, and other public records, I provide empirical evidence to support this suspicion. On the day they start their first jobs, new assistant professors in recent years have already published roughly twice as much as their counterparts did in the early 1990s. Trends for promotion to associate professor are not as dramatic but are still remarkable. I evaluate several potential explanations for these trends and conclude that they are driven mainly by changes over time in the fiscal and organizational realities of universities and departments.","authors":["John Robert Warren"],"meta":["February 2019Sociological Science 6(7):172-196","DOI:10.15195/v6.a7"],"references":["297723759_Researchers'_Individual_Publication_Rate_Has_Not_Increased_in_a_Century","249668246_Gender_Differences_in_ProductivityResearch_Specialization_as_a_Missing_Link","228782574_2009_Report_of_the_American_Sociological_Association's_Committee_on_the_Status_of_Women_in_Sociology","318780148_A_data-based_assessment_of_research-doctorate_programs_in_the_United_States","313237178_Flexibility_Sacrifice_and_Insecurity_A_Canadian_Study_Assessing_the_Challenges_of_Balancing_Work_and_Family_in_Academia","274725702_The_future_of_the_postdoc","246291745_Gender_and_Publishing_in_Sociology","243486092_Science_Since_Babylon","45604159_The_Rate_of_Growth_in_Scientific_Publication_and_the_Decline_in_Coverage_Provided_by_Science_Citation_Index","5023056_Getting_a_Job_Is_There_a_Motherhood_Penalty"]}
