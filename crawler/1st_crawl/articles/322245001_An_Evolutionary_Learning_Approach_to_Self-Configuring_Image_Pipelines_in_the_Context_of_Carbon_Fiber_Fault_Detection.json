{"id":"322245001_An_Evolutionary_Learning_Approach_to_Self-Configuring_Image_Pipelines_in_the_Context_of_Carbon_Fiber_Fault_Detection","abstract":"Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) play a key\nrole for the production of leightweight structures. Simultaneously,\nonline quality inspection of CFRP becomes more important,\nespecially for environments with high safety standards. In\nthis context, vision systems aim to find defects of different shape,\nsize, contour and orientation. Little effort, however, has been\nmade in detecting defect areas in images taken from the surface\nof carbon fibers. A common approach for segmenting filament\ndefects are edge detection and thresholding. With every change\nof material and process adjustments, the filter parameters have\nto be adapted. In this paper, we propose a cartesian genetic\nprogramming (CGP) approach to semi-automatically select\nthe best parameters. This strategy saves time for parameter\nidentification while at the same time increases precision. A test\nrun on randomly selected samples shows how the approach can\nsubstantially improve detection reliability.","authors":["Andreas Margraf","Anthony Stein","Leonhard Engstler","Steffen Geinitz"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICMLA.2017.0-165","Conference: International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)At: Canc√∫n, Mexico"],"references":["228928414_Genetic_and_evolutionary_computation_for_image_processing_and_analysis","228529307_Evaluation_From_Precision_Recall_and_F-Factor_to_ROC_Informedness_Markedness_Correlation","226649080_Image_processing_and_CGP","221039005_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming_for_Image_Processing_Tasks","3171009_Fabric_Defect_Detection_by_Fourier_Analysis","2842496_What_bloat_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming_on_Boolean_problems","2779012_An_empirical_study_of_the_efficiency_of_learning_boolean_functions_using_a_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming_approach","2333136_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming","262403823_Reducing_Wasted_Evaluations_in_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming","251885890_Automatic_image_processing_filter_generation_for_visual_defects_classification_system","235959946_Organic_Computing_-_A_Paradigm_Shift_for_Complex_Systems","227040736_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming","224184627_Automatic_construction_of_image_transformation_processes_using_genetic_algorithm","223181573_Automated_surface_inspection_for_directional_textures","222541205_Automatic_Thresholding_for_Defect_Detection","222515429_Automatic_Fiber_Orientation_Detection_for_Sewed_Carbon_Fibers","200110491_Learning_query_intent_from_regularized_click_graphs","3219697_Computer-Vision-Based_Fabric_Defect_Detection_A_Survey","2356409_Neural_Networks_in_Materials_Science"]}
