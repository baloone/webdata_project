{"id":"227061225_Introduction_An_Evolutionary_History_of_Biosemiotics","abstract":"The present chapter is intended to provide an introductory overview to the history of biosemiotics, contextualizing that history\nwithin and against the larger currents of philosophical and scientific thinking from which it has emerged. Accordingly, to\nexplain the origins of this most 21st century endeavour requires effectively tracing – at least to the level of a thumbnail\nsketch – how the “sign” concept appeared, was lost, and now must be painstakingly rediscovered and refined in science. In\nthe course of recounting this history, this chapter also introduces much of the conceptual theory underlying the project of\nbiosemiotics, and is therefore intended to serve also as a kind of primer to the readings that appear in the rest of the volume.\nWith this purpose in mind, the chapter consists of the successive examination of: (1) the history of the sign concept in pre-modernist\nscience, (2) the history of the sign concept in modernist science, and (3) the biosemiotic attempt to develop a more useful\nsign concept for contemporary science. The newcomer to biosemiotics is encouraged to read through this chapter (though lengthy\nand of necessity still incomplete) before proceeding to the rest of the volume. For only by doing so will the disparate selections\nappearing herein reveal their common unity of purpose, and only within this larger historical context can the contemporary\nattempt to develop a naturalistic understanding of sign relations be properly evaluated and understood.","authors":["Donald Favareau"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4020-9650-1_1","In book: Essential Readings in Biosemiotics (pp.1-77)"],"references":["352547169_Natural_self-interest_interactive_representation_and_the_emergence_of_objects_and_Umwelt_An_outline_of_basic_semiotic_concepts_for_biosemiotics","334347214_The_Semantic_Theory_of_Evolution","296846130_The_Organic_Codes_An_Introduction_to_Semantic_Biology","291110130_An_introduction_to_phytosemiotics_Semiotic_botany_and_vegetative_sign_systems","357221474_On_the_history_of_joining_bio_with_semio_FSRothschild_and_the_biosemiotic_rules","352549774_Pragmatics_and_biosemiotics","352549699_Mereology_and_semiotics","352548823_Evolution_of_the_window","352548760_Biosemiotics_and_ecological_monitoring","352547773_The_semiotics_of_animal_freedom_A_zoologist's_attempt_to_perceive_the_semiotic_aim_of_H_Hediger","352547294_Mimesis_as_a_phenomenon_of_semiotic_communication","352547256_Humananimal_communications_language_and_evolution","346643633_The_Foundations_of_Modern_Science_in_the_Middle_Ages_Their_Religious_Institutional_and_Intellectual_Contexts","345233649_Four_Ages_of_Understanding_The_First_Postmodern_Survey_of_Philosophy_from_Ancient_Times_to_the_Turn_of_the_Twenty-First_Century","345232532_Signs_Grow_Semiosis_and_Life_Processes","344112446_Boethius_on_Signification_and_Mind","336019168_Half_of_the_Living_World_Was_Unable_to_Communicate_for_about_One_Billion_Years","336005374_Some_Semiotic_Aspects_of_the_Psycho-Physical_Relation_The_Endo-Exosemiotic_Boundary","332671132_Man_as_a_Sign_Essays_on_the_Philosophy_of_Language","332089384_Being_There_Putting_Brain_Body_and_World_Together_Again","329651894_I_of_the_Vortex_From_Neurons_to_Self","321610015_The_Semiotics_of_Cellular_Communication_in_the_Immune_System","321564927_Speaking_of_Apes_A_Critical_Anthology_of_Two-Way_Communication_with_Man","321525427_Growth_and_Development","320181697_Development_and_Evolution_Complexity_and_Change_in_Biology","319665787_Information_and_the_Origin_of_Life","319393381_Godel_Escher_Bach_An_Eternal_Golden_Braid","318670964_The_Whole_Creature_Complexity_Biosemiotics_and_the_Evolution_of_Culture","317649484_The_Ontogeny_of_Information_Developmental_Systems_and_Evolution","316799361_Processes_and_Boundaries_of_the_Mind","315879345_What_Happened_to_Philosophy_Between_Aquinas_and_Descartes","315798899_I_Think_I_Am_a_Verb","315246422_Discourse_on_the_method_of_rightly_conducting_the_reason_and_seeking_truth_in_the_sciences","314493473_The_Philosophy_of_Charles_S_Peirce","313711479_Biosemiotics_A_functional-evolutionary_approach_to_the_analysis_ofthe_sense_of_information","313068544_Structure_dissipation_and_life","312986290_Evolutionary_epistemology","312918315_On_protein_synthesis","311814873_Language_Flow_Opening_the_subject","310752135_Facing_Up_to_the_Problem_of_Consciousness","301689573_Thomas_A_Sebeok's_Doctrine_of_Signs","292023557_Cellular_Neurosemiotics_Outline_of_an_interpretive_framework","291846092_Cyber-semiotics_On_autopoiesis_code-duality_and_sign_games_in_bio-semiotics","291771989_The_physics_and_metaphysics_of_biosemiotics","291448506_Robosemiotics_and_embodied_enactive_cognition","291369390_Life_is_'artifact-making'","291095933_Ecumenicalism_in_semiotics","289907694_On_semiosis_umwelt_and_semiosphere","289819511_Transdisciplinarity_theory-zapping_and_the_growth_of_knowledge","288090280_Cognition_as_expression_The_autopoetic_foundations_of_an_aesthetic_theory_of_nature","285864838_Why_and_how_to_naturalize_semiotic_concepts_for_biosemiotics","286022136_Speaking_of_Apes_A_Critical_Anthology_of_Two-Way_Communication_with_Man","285500634_Code-duality_and_the_semiotics_of_nature","281203304_Reflections_on_a_Theory_of_Organisms","277470715_On_Yury_Lotman"]}
