{"id":"282639642_Systolic_Expanders_of_Every_Dimension","abstract":"In recent years a high dimensional theory of expanders has emerged. The\nnotion of combinatorial expanders of graphs (i.e. the Cheeger constant of a\ngraph) has seen two generalizations to high dimensional simplicial complexes.\nOne generalization, known as {\\em coboundary expansion} is due to Linial and\nMeshulem; the other, which we term here {\\em systolic expansion}, is due to\nGromov, who showed that systolic expanders have the topological overlapping\nproperty. No construction (either random or explicit) of {\\em bounded degree}\ncombinational expanders (according to either definition) were known until a\nrecent work of~\\cite{KKL}. The work of~\\cite{KKL} provided the first bounded\ndegree systolic expanders of dimension two. No bounded degree combinatorial\nexpanders are known in higher dimensions.\nIn this work we show explicit {\\em bounded degree} systolic expanders of {\\em\nevery dimension}. This solves affirmatively an open question raised by\nGromov~\\cite{G}, who asked whether there exists bounded degree simplicial\ncomplexes with the topological overlapping property in every dimension.\nMoreover, we provide a local to global criteria on a complex that implies\nsystolic expansion: Namely, if the $1$-skeleton graph underlying a\n$d$-dimensional complex is a good expander graph and all its links are both\ncoboundary expanders and good expander graphs, then the $(d-1)$-dimensional\nskeleton of the complex is a systolic expander.","authors":["Shai Evra","Tali Kaufman"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278413824_On_Expansion_and_Topological_Overlap","265386034_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_for_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_Topological_Expanders","264385377_Mixing_Properties_and_the_Chromatic_Number_of_Ramanujan_Complexes","259212197_High_Dimensional_Expanders_and_Property_Testing","258082489_Quantum_error-correcting_codes_and_4-dimensional_arithmetic_hyperbolic_manifolds","234060060_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_High_Dimensional_Expanders","228102827_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_in_Simplicial_Complexes","222521338_Explicit_constructions_of_Ramanujan_complexes_of_type_Ad","51891283_Expander_Graphs_in_Pure_and_Applied_Mathematics","45916512_Overlap_properties_of_geometric_expanders","2113193_Ramanujan_Complexes_of_Type_tildeA_d","269721807_Simplicial_branching_random_walks_and_their_applications","247045257_On_the_realization_of_nets_in_3-dimensional_space","242538624_On_the_Complexity_of_a_Concentrator","241623638_On_laplacians_of_random_complexes","233786156_Simplicial_complexes_Spectrum_homology_and_random_walks","225398665_Singularities_Expanders_and_Topology_of_Maps_Part_2_from_Combinatorics_to_Topology_Via_Algebraic_Isoperimetry","220983711_Minors_in_random_and_expanding_hypergraphs","48174131_Coboundary_expanders","38337260_Uniform_pointwise_bounds_for_matrix_coefficients_of_unitary_representations_and_applications_to_Kazhdan_constants","2886787_Expander_Graphs_and_their_Applications","2473586_Homological_Connectivity_Of_Random_2-Complexes","2131558_Homological_connectivity_of_random_k-complexes"]}
