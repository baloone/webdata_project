{"id":"222610119_The_average_sensitivity_of_bounded-depth_circuits","abstract":"The average sensitivity of a Boolean circuit is the expected number of input bits that, when flipped, change the output of the circuit, starting with a random input setting. We show that unbounded-fanin circuits of depth d and size s have average sensitivity O(logs)dâˆ’1. This bound is asymptotically tight.","authors":["Ravi B.
