{"id":"304316411_DEM-System_a_new_type_of_adaptive_system","abstract":"A generic adaptive network called a DEM-system is presented. Deeply influenced by\ncellular automata (CA) and L-Systems, it has the structural flexibility of an L-system but can\nexpand to higher dimensions and inherits algebraic properties of CA. The behavior of DEM-\nsystems are discussed here in the case of a linear ring or chain. For the additive case, a partial\npartition into three finiteness classes is given. Interesting behaviors, such as reproduction, are\nexhibited.","authors":["Roderick Edwards","Aude Maignan"],"meta":["June 2016","Conference: AUTOMATAAt: Zurich, Switzerland"],"references":["38329520_Algebraic_Properties_of_Cellular_Automata","329230353_Classification_of_Cellular_Automata_A_Volume_in_the_Encyclopedia_of_Complexity_and_Systems_Science_Second_Edition","244960072_A_new_kind_of_science_Wolfram_Publishing","222457166_Damage_spreading_and_Lyapunov_exponents_in_cellular_automata","222437704_Universality_and_complexity_in_cellular_automata","222076189_Classifying_circular_cellular_automata","220692783_The_Algrithmic_Beauty_of_Plants","47297646_Phenomenological_study_of_irregular_cellular_automata_based_on_Lyapunov_exponents_and_Jacobians","38329597_Computation_Theory_of_Cellular_Automata","31119438_Some_Observations_on_the_Life-history_of_Anabaena_Cycadeae"]}
