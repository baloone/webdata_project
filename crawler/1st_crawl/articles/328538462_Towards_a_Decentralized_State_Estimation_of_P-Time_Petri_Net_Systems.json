{"id":"328538462_Towards_a_Decentralized_State_Estimation_of_P-Time_Petri_Net_Systems","abstract":"This paper deals with a state estimation technique in a decentralized context for discrete events dynamic systems modeled by P-Time Petri nets (P-TPN). Indeed, the observation is distributed over a set of distinct sites, each of which has its own local view of the system. Thus, thanks to a coordinator the local information transmitted by the different sites will be used to determine the set of states consistent with the current observation. The proposed method relies on an iterative procedure and the schedulability analysis of particular firing sequences called time explanations.","authors":["Patrice Bonhomme"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502529","Conference: 2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)At: Torino, Italy"],"references":["320501429_Decentralized_Fault_Diagnosis_by_Petri_Nets_and_Integer_Linear_Programming","273398925_A_Remark_on_the_Decentralized_Diagnosis_of_Labeled_Petri_Nets","267637313_Marking_Estimation_of_P-Time_Petri_Nets_With_Unobservable_Transitions","260652548_Decentralized_Diagnosis_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Labeled_Petri_Nets","305459277_Marking_Observer_in_Labeled_Petri_Nets_With_Application_to_Supervisory_Control","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","257555729_Scheduling_and_control_of_real-time_systems_based_on_a_token_player_approach","243784648_P-Time_Petri_Nets_for_manufacturing_systems","229124406_Recoverability_of_communication_protocols","224613855_Marking_estimation_of_Petri_nets_with_silent_transitions","222645987_Fault_detection_for_discrete_event_systems_using_Petri_nets_with_unobservable_transitions","3032881_Marking_Estimation_of_Petri_Nets_With_Silent_Transitions"]}
