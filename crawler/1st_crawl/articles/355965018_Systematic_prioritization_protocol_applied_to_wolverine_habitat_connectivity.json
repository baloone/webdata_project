{"id":"355965018_Systematic_prioritization_protocol_applied_to_wolverine_habitat_connectivity","abstract":"I describe a prioritization protocol for future wolverine habitat connectivity conservation using integer linear programming. Conservation prioritization has broad applications across scales, systems, and species. However, the process of preparing, generating, and analyzing the necessary data can be complex. Thus, this protocol details the process from data acquisition to implementation.\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Carroll et al. (2020) and Carroll et al. (2021).","authors":["Kathleen Carroll"],"meta":["December 2021STAR Protocols 2(4):100882","DOI:10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100882"],"references":["353173894_A_Framework_for_Collaborative_Wolverine_Connectivity_Conservation","352285471_Protected_area_networks_do_not_represent_unseen_biodiversity","346956161_Ocean_planning_for_species_on_the_move_provides_substantial_benefits_and_requires_few_trade-offs","345171104_A_blueprint_for_securing_Brazil's_marine_biodiversity_and_supporting_the_achievement_of_global_conservation_goals","341646151_Testing_landscape_resistance_layers_and_modeling_connectivity_for_wolverines_in_the_western_United_States","339949151_Wolverine_Occupancy_Spatial_Distribution_and_Monitoring_Design","295542496_Connecting_models_to_movements_testing_connectivity_model_predictions_against_empirical_migration_and_dispersal_data","334786123_Assessing_the_effectiveness_of_protected_areas_for_conserving_range-restricted_rainforest_butterflies_in_Sabah_Borneo","332060827_Beyond_protected_areas_Private_lands_and_public_policy_anchor_intact_pathways_for_multi-species_wildlife_migration","313468330_Habitat_suitability_is_a_poor_proxy_for_landscape_connectivity_during_dispersal_and_mating_movements","227648223_Assigning_Priority_to_Environmental_Policy_Interventions_in_a_Heterogeneous_World","23426973_McRae_BH_Dickson_BG_Keitt_TH_Shah_VB_Using_circuit_theory_to_model_connectivity_in_ecology_evolution_and_conservation_Ecology_89_2712-2724","269808050_Developing_priorities_for_metapopulation_conservation_at_the_landscape_scale_Wolverines_in_the_Western_United_States","258845570_A_general_model_to_quantify_ecological_integrity_for_landscape_assessments_and_US_application","230866130_Spatial_Ecology_of_Wolverines_at_the_Southern_Periphery_of_Distribution"]}
