{"id":"299006749_Perceptions_of_classroom_environment_achievement_goals_and_achievement_outcomes","abstract":"Two studies examined the relationship between undergraduates' perceptions of their classroom environment, their adoption of achievement goals for the course, and their graded performance and intrinsic motivation. Results revealed a distinct antecedent profile for each goal in the trichotomous framework: Mastery goals were linked to the presence of lecture engagement and the absence of an evaluation focus and harsh evaluation, performance-approach goals were linked to the presence of evaluation focus, and performance-avoidance goals were linked to the presence of evaluation focus and harsh evaluation. When the perceived classroom environment and achievement goal variables were tested together as predictors of graded performance and intrinsic motivation, the results clearly demonstrated that the influence of the perceived classroom environment on these outcomes measures was indirect; the perceived classroom environment influenced achievement goal adoption, and achievement goal adoption, in turn, directly influenced graded performance and intrinsic motivation.","authors":["MA Church","AJ Elliot","Shelly L Gable"],"meta":["March 2001Journal of Educational Psychology 93(1):43-54","DOI:10.1037//0022-0663.93.1.43"],"references":["277428511_Rethinking_achievement_goals_When_are_they_adaptive_for_college_students_and_why","232581723_Influences_on_Achievement_Goals_Perceived_Ability_and_Cognitive_Engagement","232485466_Predictors_and_Consequences_of_Achievement_Goals_in_the_College_Classroom_Maintaining_Interest_and_Making_the_Grade","232451658_Students'_Reports_of_Motivation_and_Negative_Affect_A_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Analysis","228079388_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Work_Domain_Goal_Orientation_Instrument","222220445_Personal_and_environmental_influences_on_students'_beliefs_about_effective_study_strategies","43118286_Classroom_and_Individual_Differences_in_Early_Adolescents'_Motivation_and_Self-Regulated_Learning","43118261_Differences_between_Elementary_and_Middle_School_Teachers_and_Students_A_Goal_Theory_Approach","19356291_The_Moderator-Mediator_Variable_Distinction_in_Social_Psychological_Research","304846946_Motivation_and_Schooling_in_the_Middle_Grades","297196168_ORIGINS_AND_PAWNS_IN_THE_CLASSROOM_-_SELF-REPORT_AND_PROJECTIVE_ASSESSMENTS_OF_INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES_IN_CHILDRENS_PERCEPTIONS","232590069_A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Approach_and_Avoidance_Achievement_Motivation","232537895_Students'_Help_Seeking_during_Problem_Solving_Influences_of_Personal_and_Contextual_Achievement_Goals","232529071_Motivational_Processes_Affecting_Learning","232529034_''Should_I_ask_for_help''_The_role_of_motivation_and_attitudes_in_adolescents'_help_seeking_in_math_class","232507082_Avoiding_the_Demonstration_of_Lack_of_Ability_An_Underexplored_Aspect_of_Goal_Theory","232476328_Self-enhancing_and_self-defeating_ego_orientation_Relations_with_task_and_avoidance_orientation_achievement_self-perceptions_and_anxiety","232439905_Differential_effects_of_two_grading_systems_on_student_performance","229731788_Using_short_forms_of_classroom_climate_instruments_to_assess_and_improve_classroom_psychosocial_environment","229493034_Motivation_and_strategy_use_in_science_Individual_differences_and_classroom_effects","222753787_I_think_therefore_I'm_motivated_The_relations_among_cognitive_strategy_use_motivational_orientation_and_classroom_perceptions_over_time","222464857_The_Development_of_Achievement_Task_Values_A_Theoretical_Analysis","222085845_A_process_analysis_of_the_effects_of_performance-contingent_rewards_on_intrinsic_motivation","13981694_Changes_in_Achievement_Goal_Orientations_Perceived_Academic_Competence_and_Grades_across_the_Transition_to_Middle-Level_Schools","8069237_Achievement_Goals_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_A_Meta-Analytic_Review"]}
