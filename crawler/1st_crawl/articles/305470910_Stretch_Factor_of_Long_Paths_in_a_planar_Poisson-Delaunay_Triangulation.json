{"id":"305470910_Stretch_Factor_of_Long_Paths_in_a_planar_Poisson-Delaunay_Triangulation","abstract":"Let $X:=X_n\\cup\\{(0,0),(1,0)\\}$, where $X_n$ is a planar Poisson point process of intensity $n$. We provide a first non-trivial lower bound for the distance between the expected length of the shortest path between $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ in the Delaunay triangulation associated with $X$ when the intensity of $X_n$ goes to infinity. Experimental values indicate that the correct value is about 1.04. We also prove that the expected number of Delaunay edges crossed by the line segment $[(0,0),(1,0)]$ is equivalent to $2.16\\sqrt{n}$ and that the expected length of a particular path converges to 1.18 giving an upper bound on the stretch factor.","authors":["Nicolas Chenavier","Olivier Devillers"],"meta":["July 2016"],"references":["306225161_The_worst_visibility_walk_in_a_random_Delaunay_triangulation_is_O_n","289496382_Tight_bounds_in_the_quadtree_complexity_theorem_and_the_maximal_number_of_pixels_crossed_by_a_curve_of_given_length","38362888_Greedy_Lattice_Animals_I_Upper_Bounds","38349346_Markov_Paths_on_the_Poisson-Delaunay_Graph_with_applications_to_routing_in_mobile_networks","2926287_Walking_in_a_Triangulation","303290433_Moderate_deviations_for_shortest-path_lengths_on_random_segment_processes","280688957_Delaunay_graphs_are_almost_as_good_as_complete_graphs","264912393_Delaunay_Mesh_Generation","227329932_The_Delaunay_triangulation_closely_approximates_the_complete_Euclidean_graph","226036877_Delaunay_Triangulation_Based_Surface_Reconstruction","222546692_Expected_time_analysis_for_Delaunay_point_location","220991419_Toward_the_Tight_Bound_of_the_Stretch_Factor_of_Delaunay_Triangulations","220556368_On_the_stabbing_number_of_a_random_Delaunay_triangulation","50435191_The_Stretch_Factor_of_the_Delaunay_Triangulation_Is_Less_Than_1998","4355154_Delaunay_graphs_are_almost_as_good_as_complete_graphs","2426605_Online_Routing_in_Triangulations"]}
