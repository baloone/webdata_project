{"id":"329184422_User_Dependent_Template_Update_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Recognition","abstract":"Regarding the fact that individuals have different interactions with biometric authentication systems, several techniques have been developed in the literature to model different users categories. Doddington Zoo is a concept of categorizing users behaviors into animal groups to reflect their characteristics with respect to biometric systems. This concept was illustrated for different biometric modalities including keystroke dynamics. The present study extends this biometric classification, by proposing a novel adaptive strategy based on the Doddinghton Zoo for user recognition with keystroke dynamics. The obtained results demonstrate competitive performances on significant keystroke dynamics datasets.","authors":["Abir Mhenni","Estelle Cherrier","Christophe Rosenberger","Najoua ESSOUKRI BEN AMARA"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1109/CW.2018.00066","Conference: 17th conference on Cyberworlds CW 2018At: Singapore"],"references":["326942813_Adaptive_Biometric_Strategy_using_Doddington_Zoo_Classification_of_User's_Keystroke_Dynamics","325909183_Towards_a_Secured_Authentication_Based_on_an_Online_Double_Serial_Adaptive_Mechanism_of_Users'_Keystroke_Dynamics","305705432_Keystroke_template_update_with_adapted_thresholds","300333945_Context-Sensitive_Self-Updating_for_Adaptive_Face_Recognition","299983923_On_Hunting_Animals_of_the_Biometric_Menagerie_for_Online_Signature","274705314_Towards_Predicting_Good_Users_for_Biometric_Recognition_Based_on_Keystroke_Dynamics","264244834_Identifying_emotion_by_keystroke_dynamics_and_text_pattern_analysis","304554974_Adaptive_approaches_for_keystroke_dynamics","260664389_Critical_analysis_of_adaptive_biometric_systems","259510764_Analysis_of_unsupervised_template_update_in_biometric_recognition_systems"]}
