{"id":"318279824_Network_approaches_to_systems_biology_analysis_of_complex_disease_integrative_methods_for_multi-omics_data","abstract":"In the past decade, significant progress has been made in complex disease research across multiple omics layers from genome, transcriptome and proteome to metabolome. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of biological interconnections, and much success has been achieved using systems biology approaches. However, because of the typical focus on one single omics layer at a time, existing systems biology findings explain only a modest portion of complex disease. Recent advances in multi-omics data collection and sharing present us new opportunities for studying complex diseases in a more comprehensive fashion, and yet simultaneously create new challenges considering the unprecedented data dimensionality and diversity. Here, our goal is to review extant and emerging network approaches that can be applied across multiple biological layers to facilitate a more comprehensive and integrative multilayered omics analysis of complex diseases.","authors":["Jingwen Yan","Shannon Risacher","Li Shen","Andrew J Saykin"],"meta":["June 2017Briefings in Bioinformatics 19(6)","DOI:10.1093/bib/bbx066","Project: Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease"],"references":["312608930_Integrated_genomic_and_molecular_characterization_of_cervical_cancer","303633792_Systematic_Functional_Annotation_and_Visualization_of_Biological_Networks","310572092_Molecular_medicine_Precision_oncology_is_not_an_illusion","309532407_WGCNA_an_R_package_for_weighted_correlation_network_analysis","307922719_Perspective_The_precision-oncology_illusion","306031058_TYROBP_genetic_variants_in_early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease","305340037_Genotypic_Context_and_Epistasis_in_Individuals_and_Populations","292781024_Human_Protein_Reference_Database-2009_update","284094466_Common_Variants_in_ABCA7_and_MSA46A_are_Associated_with_Cortical_and_Hippocampal_Atrophy","282702380_Comprehensive_Molecular_Portraits_of_Invasive_Lobular_Breast_Cancer"]}
