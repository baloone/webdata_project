{"id":"252191628_BigDog_the_Rough-Terrain_Quaduped_Robot","abstract":"Less than half the Earth's landmass is accessible to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles. But people and animals using their legs can go almost anywhere. Our mission at Boston Dynamics is to develop a new breed of rough-terrain robots that capture the mobility, autonomy and speed of living creatures. Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls. We will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain robots.","authors":["Marc Raibert","Kevin Blankespoor","Gabriel Nelson","Rob Playter"],"meta":["July 2011"],"references":[]}
