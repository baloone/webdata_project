{"id":"335199869_Augmented_reality_in_retailing_a_review_of_features_applications_and_value","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to review augmented reality (AR) within retailing by identifying, outlining and discussing definitions of AR, applications of AR that are relevant for retailers, and the value AR provides for retailers and consumers.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is based on a review of AR research within the business-oriented literature and an overview of current AR applications within retailing.\n\nFindings\nBased on previous literature, the paper presents a synthesised definition of AR, its main elements and how it differs from virtual reality. Furthermore, it reviews and provides examples of three major types of AR applications in retailing: online web based, in-store and mobile app based. Finally, the paper identifies the specific value that AR applications may provide for consumers and retailers.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe paper contributes an overview of a relatively recent but rapidly emerging theme that has not yet been sufficiently reviewed. It outlines areas for further research and thus provides value for both researchers and retail practitioners.","authors":["Federica Caboni","Johan Hagberg"],"meta":["August 2019International Journal
