The paper highlights the destabilisation effect of unmodelled actuator dynamics when applying feedback linearisation. To overcome this difficulty, a two stage feedback linearisation technique is proposed to compensate for actuator dynamics and subse- quently linearise nonlinear systems. A case study of a tri-rotor UAV is used to showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with classical feedback linearisation. The paper is written from a UAV application's point of view, however, the proposed procedure is still valid for any input-affine invertible nonlinear system.","authors":["Mohamed Kara-Mohamed","Alexander Lanzon"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/CDC.2013.6759987","Conference: 2013 IEEE 52nd Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)"],"references":["261309272_Design_and_control_of_novel_tri-rotor_UAV","234801173_Robust_Output_Feedback_Control_for_Nonlinear_Systems_Including_Actuators","266436218_Automatic_Control_Systems","228108311_Nonlinear_Control_Systems_II","224402027_Linear_Tracking_for_a_Fixed-Wing_UAV_Using_Nonlinear_Model_Predictive_Control","222881996_Effect_of_unmodeled_actuator_dynamics_on_output_feedback_stabilization_of_nonlinear_systems","221175023_The_Guidance_and_Control_of_Small_Net-recovery_UAV","215530554_Nonlinear_and_Adaptive_Control_Design","3363677_Adaptive_systems_for_signal_processing_communications_and_control","3332561_Compensation_of_Actuator_Dynamics_in_Nonlinear_Missile_Control"]}
