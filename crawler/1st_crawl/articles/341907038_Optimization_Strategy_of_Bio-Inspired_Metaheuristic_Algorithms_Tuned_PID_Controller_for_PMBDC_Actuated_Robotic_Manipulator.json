{"id":"341907038_Optimization_Strategy_of_Bio-Inspired_Metaheuristic_Algorithms_Tuned_PID_Controller_for_PMBDC_Actuated_Robotic_Manipulator","abstract":"The present article makes an attempt to evaluate the computational performance of genetic meta heuristic optimized control algorithms. Here, the multi-objective bio inspired algorithm (MOGA) and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm are used to tune linear PID (L-PID) and nonlinear PID(NL-PID) controllers to implement performance and execution control of permanent magnet brushed DC (PMBDC) motor actuated robotic manipulator. The MOGA, APSO optimised nonlinear and linear PID controllers have been validated for their response efficacy and compared in respect of the steady-state error, overshoot and settling time of PMBDC driven robotic Manipulator. The efficacy of metaheuristics such as APSO and MOGA tuned NL-PID controller are better as compared to the L- PID controlled objects. Experimental results show that the NL-PID controller mends the controlled objectsâ€™ performace with a reduction in both the overshoot as well as the settling time, if tuned either with MOGA or APSO for L-PID controllers while NL-PID controller tuned with APSO gives satisfactory dynamic response of the system.","authors":["Sudarshan K Valluru","Madhusudan Singh"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 171:2040-2049","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.04.219","Project: meta algorithms application to nonlinear dynamical systems"],"references":["323130873_Performance_Investigations_of_APSO_Tuned_Linear_and_Nonlinear_PID_Controllers_for_a_Nonlinear_Dynamical_System","318571874_Stabilization_of_nonlinear_inverted_pendulum_system_using_MOGA_and_APSO_tuned_nonlinear_PID_controller","317901605_Metaheuristic_Tuning_of_Linear_and_Nonlinear_PID_Controllers_to_Nonlinear_Mass_Spring_Damper_System","3298661_Stability_of_PID_control_for_industrial_robot_arms"]}
