The main aim of this review is to investigate the effects of game design activity on learning outcomes of students. Additionally, there are other factors examined in the review such as participant type, publication year, method, and game development tools. A total of 45 research articles published in the journals indexed in Web of Science were selected for analysis. The results show that the greatest advantage of computer game design activity that it supports students’ programming and problem solving skills. The review also revealed that computer game design activity provides an effective way in promoting children’ creative thinking skills.
