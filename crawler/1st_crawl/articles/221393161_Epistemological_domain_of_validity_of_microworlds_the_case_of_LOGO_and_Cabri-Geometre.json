{"id":"221393161_Epistemological_domain_of_validity_of_microworlds_the_case_of_LOGO_and_Cabri-Geometre","abstract":"One of the key reasons behind the introduction of educational technology into classrooms was the idea that pupils would be able to interact and learn with software, almost independently of teachers and with a closer and better relationship to knowledge. Almost two decades later we are in a position to analyse what we know about the use of software as a learning environment. Within this paper we consider this issue from an epistemological perspective. We explore the notion of epistemological domain of validity of a computer-based learning environment, where epistemological validity refers to the knowledge and the relation to knowledge made available by the software. In order to give a concrete foundation to our discussion we consider the case of LOGO and Cabri-Geometre.","authors":["Nicolas Balacheff","Rosamund Sutherland"],"meta":["January 1993","SourceDBLP","Conference: Lessons from Learning, Proceedings of the IFIP TC3/WG3.3 Working Conference on Lessons from Learning, Archamps, France, 6-8 September, 1993","Project: Bridging Didactic and TEL research in Math Ed."],"references":["281329336_Contribution_de_la_didactique_et_de_l'epistemologie_aux_recherches_en_EIAO","234788346_Mathematical_microworlds_and_intelligent_computer-assisted_instruction","228572747_From_De-contextualized_to_Situated_Knowledge_Revisiting_Piaget's_Water-Level_Experiment","226232574_Teacher's_role_and_reproducibility_of_didactical_situations","34592272_Children's_Learning_in_a_Computer_Microworld_for_Transformation_Geometry","318494168_Epistemological_Pluralism_Styles_and_Voices_within_the_Computer_Culture","276934705_Le_contrat_didactique_Le_milieu","265429785_MODIFICATIONS_DE_MENUS_DANS_CABRI-GEOMETRE_DES_SYMETRIES_COMME_OUTILS_DE_CONSTRUCTION","245497110_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Real_Teaching","243653581_Human-Computer_interaction_and_intelligent_tutoring_systems","242362936_Fondements_et_methodes_de_la_didactique_des_mathematiques","240069432_Jeu_de_Cadres_et_Dialectique_Outil-objet","238719323_Cabri-geometre_constituant_d'un_milieu_pour_l'apprentissage_de_la_notion_de_figure_geometrique","238234925_From_Micro-Worlds_to_Knowledge_Representation_In_J","226869830_Connecting_theory_and_practice_Results_from_the_teaching_of_Logo","226153639_Specificite_de_l'organisation_d'une_sequence_d'enseignement_lors_de_l'utilisation_de_l'ordinateur","225864212_A_Pedagogy_for_Mathematical_Microworlds","30515050_Modelisation_de_l'interaction_didactique_un_tuteur_hybride_sur_Cabri-geometre_pour_l'analyse_de_decisions_didactiques"]}
