We have taken a systematic approach to study neural signaling by the transmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in Drosophila. We have generated knockout and knockin lines for Trh, the 5-HT synthesizing enzyme and all five 5-HT receptors, making it possible for us to determine their expression patterns and to investigate their functional roles. Loss of the Trh, 5HT1a or 5HT2b gene decreased sleep time whereas loss of the Trh or 5HT2b gene diminished sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. 5HT2b expression in a small subset of neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) is functionally essential: elimination of the 5HT2b gene from these neurons led to loss of sleep homeostasis. Genetic ablation of 5HT2b neurons in the dFB decreased sleep and impaired sleep homeostasis. Our results have shown that serotonergic signaling in specific neurons is required for regulating sleep homeostasis.","authors":["Yongjun Qian","Yue Cao","Bowen Deng","Guang Yang"],"meta":["October 2017eLife Sciences 6:e26519","DOI:10.7554/elife.26519"],"references":["318967824_Mushroom_body_output_neurons_encode_valence_and_guide_memory-based_action_selection_in_Drosophila","305779910_Circadian_Neuron_Feedback_Controls_the_Drosophila_Sleep-Activity_Profile","282413716_Identification_of_Neurons_with_a_Privileged_Role_in_Sleep_Homeostasis_in_Drosophila_melanogaster","272841211_Gene-specific_cell_labeling_using_MiMIC_transposons","305793429_Operation_of_a_Homeostatic_Sleep_Switch","303404398_Sleep_Drive_Is_Encoded_by_Neural_Plastic_Changes_in_a_Dedicated_Circuit","297730477_Genetic_Dissociation_of_Daily_Sleep_and_Sleep_Following_Thermogenetic_Sleep_Deprivation_in_Drosophila","282816221_Propagation_of_Homeostatic_Sleep_Signals_by_Segregated_Synaptic_Microcircuits_of_the_Drosophila_Mushroom_Body","281970931_Identified_Serotonin-Releasing_Neurons_Induce_Behavioral_Quiescence_and_Suppress_Mating_in_Drosophila","279067036_TARANIS_Functions_with_Cyclin_A_and_Cdk1_in_a_Novel_Arousal_Center_to_Control_Sleep_in_Drosophila","265392186_CRISPRCas9_Mediates_Efficient_Conditional_Mutagenesis_in_Drosophila","261291676_Lowered_Insulin_Signalling_Ameliorates_Age-Related_Sleep_Fragmentation_in_Drosophila","261034029_SIFamide_and_SIFamide_Receptor_Define_a_Novel_Neuropeptide_Signaling_to_Promote_Sleep_in_Drosophila","269185075_Calcitonin_Gene-Related_Peptide_Neurons_Mediate_Sleep-Specific_Circadian_Output_in_Drosophila","262789349_Monoamines_and_Sleep_in_Drosophila"]}
