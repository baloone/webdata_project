{"id":"303899846_A_grid-based_graph_data_model_for_pedestrian_route_analysis_in_a_micro-spatial_environment","abstract":"Due to limitations in geometric representation and semantic description, the current pedestrian route analysis models are inadequate. To express the geometry of geographic entities in a micro-spatial environment accurately, the concept of a grid is presented, and grid-based methods for modeling geospatial objects are described. The semantic constitution of a building environment and the methods for modeling rooms, corridors, and staircases with grid objects are described. Based on the topology relationship between grid objects, a grid-based graph for a building environment is presented, and the corresponding route algorithm for pedestrians is proposed. The main advantages of the graph model proposed in this paper are as follows: 1) consideration of both semantic and geometric information, 2) consideration of the need for accurate geometric representation of the micro-spatial environment and the efficiency of pedestrian route analysis, 3) applicability of the graph model to route analysis in both static and dynamic environments, and 4) ability of the multi-hierarchical route analysis to integrate the multiple levels of pedestrian decision characteristics, from the high to the low, to determine the optimal path.","authors":["Yi-Quan Song","Lei Niu","Long He","Rui Wang"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Automation and Computing 13(3):296-304","DOI:10.1007/s11633-016-0979-1"],"references":["267223023_Geographic_Information_Systems_for_Transportation_GIS_-T_Principles_and_Applications","252533918_Real-time_Voxelization_for_Complex_Models","235635597_Object-oriented_GIS_in_practice","228631176_A_navigation_graph_for_real-time_crowd_animation_on_multilayered_and_uneven_terrain","224626180_Towards_Autonomous_Topological_Place_Detection_Using_the_Extended_Voronoi_Graph","221589759_Applying_hierarchical_graphs_to_pedestrian_indoor_navigation","220737802_A_Hybrid_Spatial_Model_for_Representing_Indoor_Environments","220666189_A_grid_graph-based_model_for_the_analysis_of_2D_indoor_spaces","220649878_A_combinatorial_data_model_for_representing_topological_relations_among_3D_geographical_features_in_micro-spatial_environments","45878700_Agent-Based_Simulation_of_Human_Movement_Shaped_by_the_Underlying_Street_Structure","4099322_Real-time_voxelization_for_complex_polygonal_models","292746946_Cellular_automata_microsimulation_for_modeling_bi-directional_pedestrian_walkways","262274946_Path_Planning_in_Complex_3D_Environments_Using_a_Probabilistic_Roadmap_Method","249872208_Geographical_information_science_Agent-based_models","242608953_Object-oriented_design_with_applications_2nd_ed","238799612_A_Formal_Basis_for_the_Heuristic_Determination_of_Minimum_Cost_Paths","233220600_Moving_Agent_Pedestrians_Through_Space_and_Time","230876241_Foundations_of_Cognitive_Grammar_I_Theoretical_Prerequisites","228533427_3D_spatial_information_for_fire-fighting_search_and_rescue_route_analysis_within_buildings","228053445_Crowd_Simulation","226663993_Technology_for_simulating_crowd_evacuation_behaviors","226367235_A_trajectory-oriented_carriageway-based_road_network_data_model_part_1_Background","222652268_Cellular_Automata_Microsimulation_of_Bi-Directional_Pedestrian_Flows","221422801_Graph_Model_Based_Indoor_Tracking","220631556_Object-Oriented_Analysis_and_Design_with_Applications","23541255_Agent-Based_Modelling_of_Pedestrian_Movements_The_Questions_That_Need_to_Be_Asked_and_Answered","3479333_A_Formal_Basis_for_the_Heuristic_Determination_of_Minimum_Cost_Paths","2716330_Hierarchical_Optimization_of_Optimal_Path_Finding_for_Transportation_Applications"]}
