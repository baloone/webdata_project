We show applications to image denoising, zooming, and the computation of the mean curvature motion of interfaces.","authors":["A Chambolle"],"meta":["January 2004Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 20(1-2):89-97","Conference: 4th Conference on Mathematics and Image AnalysisVolume: 20"],"references":[]}
