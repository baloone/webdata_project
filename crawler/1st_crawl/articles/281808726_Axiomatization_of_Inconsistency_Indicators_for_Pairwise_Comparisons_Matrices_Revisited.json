{"id":"281808726_Axiomatization_of_Inconsistency_Indicators_for_Pairwise_Comparisons_Matrices_Revisited","abstract":"This study proposes axioms for inconsistency indicators in pairwise\ncomparisons. The new observation (by Szybowski), that \"no $PC$ submatrix may\nhave a worse inconsistency indicator than the given $PC$ matrix\" is an\nessential simplification of the axiomatization. The goal of formulating axioms\nfor all future definitions of new inconsistency indicators is difficult and as\nillusive as the inconsistency concept itself. This study improves the\naxiomatization proposed by Koczkodaj and Szwarc in 2014. As a side product, the\nnew axiom allows to prevent approximation error aberrations of an arbitrarily\nlarge value in the input data.","authors":["W. W.
