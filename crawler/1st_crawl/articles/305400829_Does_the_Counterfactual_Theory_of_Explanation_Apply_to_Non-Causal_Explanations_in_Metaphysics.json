{"id":"305400829_Does_the_Counterfactual_Theory_of_Explanation_Apply_to_Non-Causal_Explanations_in_Metaphysics","abstract":"In the recent philosophy of explanation, a growing attention to and discussion of non-causal explanations has emerged, as there seem to be compelling examples of non-causal explanations in the sciences, in pure mathematics, and in metaphysics. I defend the claim that the counterfactual theory of explanation (CTE) captures the explanatory character of both non-causal scientific and metaphysical explanations. According to the CTE, scientific and metaphysical explanations are explanatory by virtue of revealing counterfactual dependencies between the explanandum and the explanans. I support this claim by illustrating that CTE is applicable to Euler’s explanation (an example of a non-causal scientific explanation) and Loewer’s explanation (an example of a non-causal metaphysical explanation).","authors":["Alexander Reutlinger"],"meta":["July 2016European Journal for Philosophy of Science 7(2)","DOI:10.1007/s13194-016-0155-z"],"references":["283428216_The_Question_of_Realism","283420101_Nature's_Capacities_and_their_Measurement","275159129_CHRISTOPHER_PINCOCK_Mathematics_and_Scientific_Representation","240548010_Thinking_About_Mechanisms","345176555_The_Asymmetry_of_'Because'","344486537_Laws_and_Symmetry","344082909_Simulation_and_Similarity_Using_Models_to_Understand_the_World","337136314_Why_Do_Laws_Explain","326941290_The_Mathematical_route_to_causal_understanding","325539173_What_is_a_law_of_nature","316292614_A_Theory_of_Causation_in_the_Social_and_Biological_Sciences","304044060_Explanatory_Asymmetries_Laws_of_Nature_Rehabilitated","297883720_Scientific_Metaphysics","297830903_Philosophical_Explanations","290022079_The_Metaphysics_Within_Physics","289230215_Nature's_Metaphysics_Laws_and_Properties","288444773_Explaining_Explanation","286244599_Aspects_of_Mathematical_Explanation_Symmetry_Unity_and_Salience","285528037_Why_There_Is_Anything_Except_Physics","284585955_Humean_Supervenience_Debugged","284466008_Causal_Explanation","283420772_Precis_of_Nature's_Capacities_and_Their_Measurement","281797025_Explanation_in_Mathematics","281249590_Mathematical_Explanation_Why_it_Matters","279265725_On_Explanations_from_'Geometry_of_Motion'","275306291_Are_There_Non-Causal_Explanations_of_Particular_Events","275159135_Abstract_Explanations_in_Science","274412756_What_Makes_a_Scientific_Explanation_Distinctively_Mathematical","273018468_Explanatory_Unification","271732667_Reassessing_Woodward's_Account_of_Explanation_Regularities_Counterfactuals_and_Noncausal_Explanations","270650140_Grounding_in_the_Image_of_Causation","270376312_Noncausal_Connections","268638822_The_Nature_of_Mathematical_Knowledge","266188405_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Networks","265495663_Mathematics_and_Scientific_Representation","265448372_Metaphysical_Dependence_Grounding_and_Reduction","262771677_How_dimensional_analysis_can_explain","261743680_Causation_as_Influence","259713478_Really_Statistical_Explanations_and_Genetic_Drift","259709315_Conservation_Laws_in_Scientific_Explanations_Constraints_or_Coincidences","257637518_Two_Accounts_of_Laws_and_Time","257560592_The_Interventionist_Account_of_Causation_and_Non-causal_Association_Laws","257382078_Simulation_and_Similarity","254639309_On_What_Grounds_What","254394630_Inference_To_the_Best_Explanation","251253584_Alexander_Bird_Nature's_Metaphysics_Laws_and_properties","247043261_On_the_Notion_of_Cause","246902943_Multiple_Realizability_and_Universality","243683941_Aspects_of_Scientific_Explanation_and_Other_Essays","239932027_Contact_with_the_Nomic_A_Challenge_for_Deniers_of_Humean_Supervenience_about_Laws_of_Nature","231927187_A_Logic_for_'Because","228021437_Explanatory_Generalizations_Part_I_A_Counterfactual_Account","228009660_Dimensional_Explanations","227984968_Review_of_Woodward_Making_Things_Happen","227605655_Bounded_Rationality"]}
