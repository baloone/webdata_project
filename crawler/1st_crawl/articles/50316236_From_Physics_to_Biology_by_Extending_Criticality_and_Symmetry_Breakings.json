{"id":"50316236_From_Physics_to_Biology_by_Extending_Criticality_and_Symmetry_Breakings","abstract":"Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular since the work by E.\nNoether and H. Weyl in the first half of last century. Herein, we briefly\nreview their role by recalling how symmetry changes allow to conceptually move\nfrom classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We then introduce our\nongoing theoretical analysis in biology and show that symmetries play a\nradically different role in this discipline, when compared to those in current\nphysics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in\nrelation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the\ntheories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various\nlevels of organization, are not \"just\" processes, but permanent (extended, in\nour terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the\nlimits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),\nvariability is at the core of these transitions.","authors":["Giuseppe Longo","Maël Montévil"],"meta":["March 2011Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 106(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.03.005","SourcearXiv","Project: Theoretical Principles for Biology"],"references":["302142233_The_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Mechanics","292255502_Experimental_realization_of_einstein-podolsky-rosen-bohm_gedankenexperiment_-_A_new_violation_of_bell_inequality","265367620_The_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Theory","262487184_Design_of_Biological_Organisms_and_Fractal_Geometry","262487177_The_Society_of_Cells_Cancer_and_Control_of_Cell_Proliferation","262487095_The_Origins_of_Order","262486793_Self-Organized_Criticality_Emergent_Complex_Behavior_in_Physical_and_Biological_Systems","258330233_Quantum_Superposition","256594412_Self-organized_criticality","251735841_Critical_slowing_down_at_a_bifurcation"]}
