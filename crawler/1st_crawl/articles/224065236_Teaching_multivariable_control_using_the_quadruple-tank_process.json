{"id":"224065236_Teaching_multivariable_control_using_the_quadruple-tank_process","abstract":"A multivariable laboratory process is presented together with its\nuse in a graduate control course. The process is called the\nquadruple-tank process and demonstrates a multivariable level control\nproblem. The multivariable zero dynamics of the system can be made both\nminimum phase and nonminimum phase by simply changing a valve. This\nmakes the quadruple-tank process suitable for illustrating many concepts\nin linear and nonlinear multivariable control. In the paper some of\nthese are described together with the basic setup of the process. Two\ncomputer exercises and one laboratory exercise have been developed as\npart of a course in multivariable and nonlinear control. These are\ndetailed and some experience from the course is presented","authors":["Karl H. Johansson","Alexander Horch","O.
