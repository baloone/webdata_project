{"id":"262806173_A_2D_closed_form_model_for_the_electrostatics_in_hetero-junction_double-gate_tunnel-FETs_for_calculation_of_band-to-band_tunneling_current","abstract":"In the last few years the Tunnel-FET has become one of the promising devices to be the successor of the MOSFET due to its CMOS compatibility and steep subthreshold slopes (S) below 60 mV/dec. Hetero-junctions at the channel interface are used to improve the on-state current of the device. In this paper a 2D physics-based analytical model for hetero-junction Tunnel-FETs is introduced. It predicts a 2D band-to-band tunneling probability calculation through Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation (WKB) based on a 2D solution of electrostatics with respect to the device structure and carrier distributions in the device. These results are embedded in a model for the device current. The solutions of the potential, electrical field and the current transfer characteristics of the model are in good agreement with simulation data from the finite-element-method (FEM) simulator TCAD Sentaurus.","authors":["Michael Graef","Thomas Holtij","Franziska Hain","Alexander Kloes"],"meta":["September 2014Microelectronics Journal 45(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.mejo.2014.04.033"],"references":["263269478_Modeling_of_the_Impact_of_SourceDrain_Regions_on_Short_Channel_Effects_in_MOSFETs","228723526_Low-Voltage_Tunnel_Transistors_for_Beyond_CMOS_Logic","3257073_Tunneling_Field-Effect_Transistors_TFETs_With_Subthreshold_Swing_SS_Less_Than_60_mVdec","271483547_Two-dimensional_bias_dependent_model_for_the_screening_length_in_double-gate_Tunnel-FETs","261351689_Drain-conductance_optimization_in_nanowire_TFETs","259717527_Two-Dimensional_Physics-Based_Modeling_of_Electrostatics_and_Band-to-Band_Tunneling_in_Tunnel-FETs","258792713_Semianalytical_Model_of_the_Subthreshold_Current_in_Short-Channel_Junctionless_Symmetric_Double-Gate_Field-Effect_Transistors","230667728_2D_Analytical_Calculation_of_the_Electric_Field_in_Lightly_Doped_Schottky_Barrier_Double-Gate_MOSFETs_and_Estimation_of_the_TunnelingThermionic_Current","230667664_Analytical_Compact_Modeling_Framework_for_the_2D_Electrostatics_in_Lightly_Doped_Double-Gate_MOSFETs","230660702_Simulation_of_Tunneling_in_Semiconductor_Devices","229359983_2D_analytical_calculation_of_the_electrostatic_potential_in_lightly_doped_Schottky_barrier_Double-Gate_MOSFET","224392555_Double-Gate_Strained-Ge_Heterostructure_Tunneling_FET_TFET_With_record_high_drive_currents_and_60mVdec_subthreshold_slope","223053017_A_new_analytical_method_of_solving_2D_Poisson's_equation_in_MOS_devices_applied_to_threshold_voltage_and_subthreshold_modeling","222140329_Measurement_of_Bandgap_Narrowing_in_Si_Bipolar_Transistors","4161709_Simultaneous_measurement_of_hole_lifetime_hole_mobility_and_bandgap_narrowing_in_heavily_doped_n-type_silicon","3252820_Quantum-mechanical_effects_on_the_threshold_voltage_of_ultrathin-SOI_NMOSFETs","3075483_Semi-Analytical_Modeling_of_Short-Channel_Effects_in_Si_and_Ge_Symmetrical_Double-Gate_MOSFETs"]}
