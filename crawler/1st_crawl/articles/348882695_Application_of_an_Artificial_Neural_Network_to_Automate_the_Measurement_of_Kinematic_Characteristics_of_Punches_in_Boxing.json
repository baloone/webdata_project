{"id":"348882695_Application_of_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_to_Automate_the_Measurement_of_Kinematic_Characteristics_of_Punches_in_Boxing","abstract":"This work aimed to study the automation of measuring the speed of punches of boxers during shadow boxing using inertial measurement units (IMUs) based on an artificial neural network (ANN). In boxing, for the effective development of an athlete, constant control of the punch speed is required. However, even when using modern means of measuring kinematic parameters, it is necessary to record the circumstances under which the punch was performed: The type of punch (jab, cross, hook, or uppercut) and the type of activity (shadow boxing, single punch, or series of punches). Therefore, to eliminate errors and accelerate the process, that is, automate measurements, the use of an ANN in the form of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is proposed. During the experiments, IMUs were installed on the boxers’ wrists. The input parameters of the ANN were the absolute acceleration and angular velocity. The experiment was conducted for three groups of boxers with different levels of training. The developed model showed a high level of punch recognition for all groups, and it can be concluded that the use of the ANN significantly accelerates the collection of data on the kinetic characteristics of boxers’ punches and allows this process to be automated.","authors":["Ilshat Khasanshin"],"meta":["January 2021Applied Sciences 11(3):1223","DOI:10.3390/app11031223"],"references":["345916196_An_Evaluation_of_Wearable_Inertial_Sensor_Configuration_and_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Models_for_Automatic_Punch_Classification_in_Boxing","340947793_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Intelligent_Data_Analysis_Methods_for_Smart_Sport_Training","330538761_Inertial_Sensors_for_Performance_Analysis_in_Combat_Sports_A_Systematic_Review","330317373_Wearables_Biomechanical_Feedback_and_Human_Motor-Skills'_Learning_Optimization","328637638_Computational_Intelligence_in_Sports_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","324990217_Recognition_of_Action_Dynamics_in_Fencing_Using_Multimodal_Cues","327590412_Machine_and_deep_learning_for_sport-specific_movement_recognition_a_systematic_review_of_model_development_and_performance","327352611_Classification_of_motor_errors_to_provide_real-time_feedback_for_sports_coaching_in_virtual_reality_-_A_case_study_in_squats_and_Tai_Chi_pushes","321534252_Bernstein's_levels_of_movement_construction_A_contemporary_perspective","320406965_Posture-based_and_Action-based_Graphs_for_Boxing_Skill_Visualization"]}
