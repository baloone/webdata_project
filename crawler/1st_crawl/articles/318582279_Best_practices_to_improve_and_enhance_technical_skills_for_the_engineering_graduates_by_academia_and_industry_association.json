Industries readily employ talent with versatility and industry-ready skills. The business challenge is that the fresh engineering students, who are tested during recruitment and hired, should be employable and be productive -Aware of IT industry landscape, technology areas, aware of their role, and the competencies that need to be demonstrated in IT industry. However, the employability factor of on-campus engineering students is about 20-25%, due to the student's low exposure to industry awareness, and they are not aware of current trends and industry expectations. This paper analyzes the improvement of students in various subjects by introducing the training to the students and the faculty as well by following the proven best practices. This training is given in the form of Workshops, FDPs, and Guest Lectures by industry experts in their concern areas. This paper analyzes the impact on Computer science and engineering education and prepare under graduates ready to work in MNCs with required skill set in programming areas.","authors":["R.T.
