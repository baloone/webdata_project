The Whitireia New Zealand (Whitireia) School of Health Te Kura Hauora uses volunteer actors and staff to portray patients for simulated learning experiences. A literature review was undertaken to explore how simulated patients are defined and used in undergraduate nursing curricula. The Whitireia Summons database was used to search for literature on simulated patients across CINAHL, Pubmed and Proquest databases and the OVID database. From this literature review, it was found that simulated patients are effective in the teaching and learning of skills in relation to patient communication and assessment, as well as in developing therapeutic relationships. The challenges in developing this resource are the costs and the time required for training and curriculum development. The Whitireia School of Health needs to continue to develop their use of simulated patients to construct a more comprehensive and interactive simulation learning experience for the students. With Whitireia's clinical laboratory manager, their newly appointed simulation educator and the already-in-place Simulation Learning Environment Users Group (SLEUG), Whitireia can develop their simulated patient resource, further enabling students to grow in confidence, knowledge and readiness to apply their clinical skills to practice.","authors":["Alexandra Wordsworth","Agustilia Rodrigues"],"meta":["November 2018"],"references":[]}
