{"id":"306046846_Robust_Visual_Knowledge_Transfer_via_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Based_Domain_Adaptation","abstract":"We address the problem of visual knowledge adaptation by leveraging labeled patterns from source domain and a very limited number of labeled instances in target domain to learn a robust classifier for visual categorization. This paper proposes a new extreme learning machine (ELM)-based cross-domain network learning framework, that is called ELM-based Domain Adaptation (EDA). It allows us to learn a category transformation and an ELM classifier with random projection by minimizing the â„“\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub>\n-norm of the network output weights and the learning error simultaneously. The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during cross-domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing classifiers can be readily incorporated as the base classifiers. The network output weights cannot only be analytically determined, but also transferrable. In addition, a manifold regularization with Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to semisupervised learning. Extensively, we also propose a model of multiple views, referred as MvEDA. Experiments on benchmark visual datasets for video event recognition and object recognition demonstrate that our EDA methods outperform the existing cross-domain learning methods.","authors":["Lei Zhang","David Zhang"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 25(10):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2016.2598679"],"references":["293016941_Why_neurons_mix_High_dimensionality_for_higher_cognition","270460569_Semi-Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Extreme_Learning_Machines","268820453_Domain_Adaptation_Extreme_Learning_Machines_for_Drift_Compensation_in_E-Nose_Systems","267339744_Trends_in_Extreme_Learning_Machines_A_Review","262808250_Asymmetric_and_Category_Invariant_Feature_Transformations_for_Domain_Adaptation","261317680_Generalized_Multiview_Analysis_A_discriminative_latent_space","253335726_Joint_Embedding_Learning_and_Sparse_Regression_A_Framework_for_Unsupervised_Feature_Selection","224579268_Recognizing_realistic_actions_from_videos_in_the_Wild","221996914_Large_Scale_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","221620154_Correcting_Sample_Selection_Bias_by_Unlabeled_Data","221618060_Efficient_and_Robust_Feature_Selection_via_Joint_l2_1-Norms_Minimization","221364959_Learning_A_Discriminative_Dictionary_for_Sparse_Coding_via_Label_Consistent_K-SVD","342232632_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","313388283_Multiple_kernel_learning_conic_duality_and_the_SMO_algorithm","310827970_Weighted_sums_of_random_kitchen_sinks_replacing_minimization_with_randomization_in_learning","310752944_Frustratingly_easy_domain_adaptation","308953712_Improving_image_classification_using_semantic_attributes","308863426_Beyond_the_shortest_path_Unsupervised_domain_adaptation_by_Sampling_Subspaces_along_the_Spline_Flow","290443699_LSDT_Latent_Sparse_Domain_Transfer_Learning_for_Visual_Adaptation","285809501_Correcting_sample_selection_bias_by_unlabeled_data","278169358_An_Insight_into_Extreme_Learning_Machines_Random_Neurons_Random_Features_and_Kernels","277923724_What_are_Extreme_Learning_Machines_Filling_the_Gap_Between_Frank_Rosenblatt's_Dream_and_John_von_Neumann's_Puzzle","275057952_SURF_Speeded_up_robust_features","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","264312048_Learning_With_Augmented_Features_for_Supervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Heterogeneous_Domain_Adaptation","263319592_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_for_Visual_Object_Recognition_A_Review","261227189_Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaptation_with_Instance_Constraints","261200444_Geodesic_flow_kernel_for_unsupervised_domain_adaptation","259441018_One-Shot_Adaptation_of_Supervised_Deep_Convolutional_Models","257672271_Coupled_Action_Recognition_and_Pose_Estimation_from_Multiple_Views","257531001_Jointly_Learning_Visually_Correlated_Dictionaries_for_Large-Scale_Visual_Recognition_Applications","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","228071475_Visual_Classification_With_Multitask_Joint_Sparse_Representation","227716476_Learning_with_Augmented_Features_for_Heterogeneous_Domain_Adaptation","224254959_What_you_saw_is_not_what_you_get_Domain_adaptation_using_asymmetric_kernel_transforms","224240925_Domain_Transfer_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","224135986_Automatic_Annotation_of_Human_Actions_in_Video","224135925_Multiple_Kernels_for_Object_Detection","221654517_Column-generation_boosting_methods_for_mixture_of_kernels","221619226_Exploiting_weakly-labeled_web_images_to_improve_object_classification_A_domain_adaptation_approach","221573004_Cross-domain_video_concept_detection_using_adaptive_SVMs","221362282_Domain_Transfer_SVM_for_video_concept_detection","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221345639_Learning_Multi-View_Neighborhood_Preserving_Projections","221318715_Kodak's_consumer_video_benchmark_data_set_Concept_definition_and_annotation","221318626_Large-scale_multimodal_semantic_concept_detection_for_consumer_video","221304272_Adapting_Visual_Category_Models_to_New_Domains","221111548_Multi-observation_visual_recognition_via_joint_dynamic_sparse_representation","221110017_Domain_adaptation_for_object_recognition_An_unsupervised_approach","221110000_On_Feature_Combination_for_Multiclass_Object_Classification","220814221_Heterogeneous_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Manifold_Alignment","220765558_Transfer_Learning_on_Heterogenous_Feature_Spaces_via_Spectral_Transformation","220343627_Linear_Programming_Boosting_via_Column_Generation","220279627_Domain_Adaptation_From_Multiple_Sources_A_Domain-Dependent_Regularization_Approach"]}
