Recent demands consider its informed integration in classrooms. The current study aims to investigate whether informed use of Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) technologies affects studentsâ€™ real-time emotions in mathematics classes, through an integrative research model that combines two components: varying levels of technology integration and varied levels of problem-solving skills. Participants included 64 sixth-grade students who were assigned to one of two comparison groups who have been progressively exposed to different implementations of the research model. The study used a real-time judgment of emotions scale, and a reflective questionnaire. Findings indicate that when being exposed to informed IWB integration, more positive emotions arose in real-time during learning; specifically, toward understanding-performance, and when being required to demonstrate applying problem-solving skills. The study provides a holistic view that reinforces the interplay between the two components of the integrative research model, particularly as it supports the advantage of an informed IWB technology integration in a way that most successfully incorporated with the cognitive demand required from students.","authors":["Zehavit Kohen"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Mathematical Education 50(5):1-24","DOI:10.1080/0020739X.2018.1562119"],"references":["320654304_Teachers_for_Smart_Classrooms_The_Extent_of_Implementation_of_an_Interactive_Whiteboard-based_Professional_Development_Program_on_Elementary_Teachers'_Instructional_Practices","313315495_A_New_Way_of_Using_the_Interactive_Whiteboard_in_a_High_School_Physics_Classroom_A_Case_Study","289963462_Learning_to_think_mathematically_Problem_solving_metacognition_and_sense_making_in_mathematics","249233807_The_Effects_of_Interactive_Whiteboards_IWBs_on_Student_Performance_and_Learning_A_Literature_Review","249020411_Running_with_technology_The_pedagogic_impact_of_the_large-scale_introduction_of_interactive_whiteboards_in_one_secondary_school","249020278_The_interactive_whiteboard_A_literature_survey","243768420_An_Exploration_of_the_Mathematics_Self-EfficacyMathematics_Performance_Correspondence","234139446_Connected_Minds_Technology_and_Today's_Learners","232808541_Planning_to_teach_with_digital_tools_Introducing_the_interactive_whiteboard_to_pre-service_secondary_mathematics_teachers","229366277_Measuring_emotions_in_students'_learning_and_performance_The_Achievement_Emotions_Questionnaire_AEQ","227089465_Cognitive_Metacognitive_and_Motivational_Aspects_of_Problem_Solving","224029397_A_General_Inductive_Approach_for_Analyzing_Qualitative_Evaluation_Data","45163384_A_'learning_revolution'_Investigating_pedagogic_practice_around_interactive_whiteboards_in_British_primary_classrooms_1","19257755_An_Attributional_Theory_of_Achievement_Motivation_and_Emotion","331648924_Transforming_students'_lives_with_social_and_emotional_learning","321755504_Discrete_Mathematics_and_the_Affective_Dimension_of_Mathematical_Learning_and_Engagement","320194808_Interactive_Whiteboards_Pedagogy_and_Pupil_Performance_An_Evaluation_of_the_Schools_Whiteboard_Expansion_Project_London_Challenge","318343664_Technology_usage_in_mathematics_education_research_-_A_systematic_review_of_recent_trends","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","316915145_Emotions_and_motivation_in_mathematics_education_theoretical_considerations_and_empirical_contributions","306151908_Experimental_and_quasi-experimental_designs_for_research_on_teaching","294345528_Dynamic_mathematics_with_GeoGebra","290824252_The_digital_whiteboard_A_tool_in_early_leteracy_instruction","261719497_Problematizing_the_STEM_pipeline_metaphor_Is_the_STEM_pipeline_metaphor_serving_our_students_and_the_STEM_workforce","261667362_Technology_in_the_Classroom_Interactive_Whiteboards_Creating_Higher-level_Technological_Thinkers","259128843_Adolescents'_declining_motivation_to_learn_science_A_follow-up_study","257044725_Developing_a_TPCK-SRL_assessment_scheme_for_conceptually_advancing_technology_in_education","251408399_What_can_digital_technologies_take_from_and_bring_to_research_in_mathematics_education","249049223_The_pros_and_cons_of_interactive_whiteboards_in_relation_to_the_key_stage_3_strategy_and_framework","233896913_Expectancies_values_and_academic_behaviors","233896451_Perceived_Self-Efficacy_in_Cognitive_Development_and_Functioning","232433016_Mathematics_Self-Efficacy_and_Mathematics_Performances_The_Need_for_Specificity_of_Assessment","228362196_Preparing_teachers_to_teach_science_and_mathematics_with_technology_Developing_a_technology_pedagogical_content_knowledge","227835436_A_process-oriented_view_of_student_motivation_and_cognition","225615683_A_Cognitive_Analysis_of_Problems_of_Comprehension_in_a_Learning_of_Mathematics","225610891_The_Control-Value_Theory_of_Achievement_Emotions_Assumptions_Corollaries_and_Implications_for_Educational_Research_and_Practice","225164460_From_static_to_dynamic_mathematics_Historical_and_representational_perspectives","222560329_Toward_a_decision-theoretic_framework_for_affect_recognition_and_user_assistance","222441026_The_role_of_motivation_in_promoting_and_sustaining_self-regulated_learning_International_Journal_of_Educational_Research_316_459-470","222297026_Epistemological_and_methodological_issues_for_the_conceptualization_development_and_assessment_of_ICT-TPCK_Advances_in_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_TPCK","220663126_Interactive_whiteboards_Boon_or_bandwagon_A_critical_review_of_the_literature","220140122_Learning_science_via_animated_movies_Its_effect_on_students'_thinking_and_motivation","220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge"]}
