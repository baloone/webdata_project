{"id":"306244874_Maghrebian_dialect_recognition_based_on_support_vector_machines_and_neural_network_classifiers","abstract":"This paper investigates the feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN) and the support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of two Maghrebian dialects: Tunisian and Moroccan. The dialect used by the Moroccan speakers is called “La Darijja” and that of Tunisians is called “Darija”. An Automatic Speech Recognition System is implemented in order to identify ten Arabic digits (from zero to nine). The implementation of our present system consists of two phases: The features extraction using a variety of popular hybrid techniques and the classification phase using separately the FFBPNN and the SVM. The experimental results showed that the recognition rates with both approaches have reached 98.3 % with FFBPNN and 97.5 % with SVM.","authors":["Mohamed Hassine","Lotfi Boussaid","Hassani Messaoud"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Speech Technology 19(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10772-016-9360-6","Project: Habilitation"],"references":["303836091_MADAMIRA_A_Fast_Comprehensive_Tool_for_Morphological_Analysis_and_Disambiguation_of_Arabic","272563412_Hybrid_Techniques_for_Arabic_Letter_Recognition","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","303836179_Morphological_analysis_and_disambiguation_for_dialectal_arabic","301404529_Automatic_Identification_of_Arabic_Language_Varieties_and_Dialects_in_Social_Media","301390169_Automatic_identification_of_arabic_dialects_in_social_media","294866306_The_sociolinguistic_situation_of_the_Amazighe","290451700_Speech_recognition_using_Hidden_Markov_model","281959741_GMM-based_maghreb_dialect_identification_system","270877880_Sentence_Level_Dialect_Identification_in_Arabic","266056815_CODACT_Towards_Identifying_Orthographic_Variants_in_Dialectal_Arabic","230668372_Spoken_Arabic_Dialect_Identification_Using_Phonotactic_Modeling","265825237_AUTOMATIC_IDENTIFICATION_OF_ARABIC_DIALECTS_USING_HIDDEN_MARKOV_MODELS","260392015_Morphological_Analysis_and_Disambiguation_for_Dialectal_Arabic","252015653_Speech_recognition_using_Radial_Basis_Function_neural_network"]}
