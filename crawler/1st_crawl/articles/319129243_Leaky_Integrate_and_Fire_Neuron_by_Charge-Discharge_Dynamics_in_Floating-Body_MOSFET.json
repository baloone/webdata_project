To achieve a large scale network akin to biology, a power and area efficient electronic neuron is essential. Earlier, we had demonstrated an LIF neuron by a novel 4-terminal impact ionization based n+/p/n+ with an extended gate (gated-INPN) device by physics simulation. Excellent improvement in area and power compared to conventional analog circuit implementations was observed. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact conventional 3-terminal partially depleted (PD) SOI- MOSFET (100 nm gate length) to replace the 4-terminal gated-INPN device. Impact ionization (II) induced floating body effect in SOI-MOSFET is used to capture LIF neuron behavior to demonstrate spiking frequency dependence on input. MHz operation enables attractive hardware acceleration compared to biology. Overall, conventional PD-SOI-CMOS technology enables very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) which is essential for biology scale (~10ยนยน neuron based) large neural networks.","authors":["Sangya Dutta","Vinay Kumar","Aditya Shukla","Nihar Ranjan Mohapatra"],"meta":["December 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-07418-y"],"references":["303968376_Neuronal_Ion-Channel_Dynamics_in_Silicon","318330092_A_software-equivalent_SNN_hardware_using_RRAM-array_for_asynchronous_real-time_learning","309751109_Sub-02_V_Impact_Ionization_in_Si_n-i-p-i-n_Diode","304358877_ReRAM-based_analog_synapse_and_IMT_neuron_device_for_neuromorphic_system","303092482_Stochastic_phase-change_neurons","283841806_An_ultra-compact_and_low_power_neuron_based_on_SOI_platform","261085479_Hardware_spiking_neurons_design_Analog_or_digital","260869499_Pulsed_Neural_Networks","258792704_Specifications_of_Nanoscale_Devices_and_Circuits_for_Neuromorphic_Computational_Systems","257351902_Silicon_spiking_neurons_for_hardware_implementation_of_Extreme_Learning_Machines"]}
