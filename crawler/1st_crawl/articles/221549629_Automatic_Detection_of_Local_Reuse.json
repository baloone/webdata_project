{"id":"221549629_Automatic_Detection_of_Local_Reuse","abstract":"Local reuse detection is a prerequisite for a multitude of tasks ranging from document management and information retrieval \nto web search or plagiarism detection. Its results can be used to support authors in creating new learning resources or learners\nin finding existing ones by providing accurate suggestions for related documents. While the detection of local text reuse,\ni.e. reuse of parts of documents, is covered by various approaches, reuse detection for object-based documents has been hardly\nconsidered yet. In this paper we propose a new fingerprinting technique for local reuse detection for both text-based and\nobject-based documents which is based on the contiguity of documents. This additional information, which is generally disregarded\nby existing approaches, allows the creation of shorter and more flexible fingerprints. Evaluations performed on different\ncorpora have shown that it performs better than existing approaches while maintaining a significantly lower storage consumption.","authors":["Arno Mittelbach","Lasse Lehmann","Christoph Rensing","Ralf Steinmetz"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-16020-2_16","SourceDBLP","Conference: Sustaining TEL: From Innovation to Learning and Practice - 5th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2010, Barcelona, Spain, September 28 - October 1, 2010.
