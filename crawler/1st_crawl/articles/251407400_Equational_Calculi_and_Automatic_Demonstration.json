{"id":"251407400_Equational_Calculi_and_Automatic_Demonstration","abstract":"By an equational calculus, we mean — in this paper — a calculus in which the formulas have the form of equations (a=b) and in which the only rule of inference is that of replacing equals by equals. There is no rule of substitution. In the\nequations, the terms a and b are formed in the usual manner by means of atomic constant terms i,j,k,... and operation symbols f,g,h,... Thus, (f(i,g(j))=g(f(i,j))) is an example of an equation.","authors":["Ghita HolmstrÖm-Hintikka","Sten LindstrÖm","Rysiek Sliwinski"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/978-94-010-0500-5_9"],"references":[]}
