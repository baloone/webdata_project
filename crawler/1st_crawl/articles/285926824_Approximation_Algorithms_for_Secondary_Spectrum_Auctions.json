{"id":"285926824_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Secondary_Spectrum_Auctions","abstract":"We study combinatorial auctions for secondary spectrum markets, where short-term communication licenses are sold to wireless nodes. Channels can be assigned to multiple bidders according to interference constraints captured by a conflict graph. We suggest a novel approach to such combinatorial auctions using a graph parameter called inductive independence number. We achieve good approximation results by showing that interference constraints for wireless networks imply a bounded inductive independence number. For example, in the physical model the factor becomes O (âˆš k log 2 n ) for n bidders and k channels. Our algorithms can be turned into incentive-compatible mechanisms for bidders with arbitrary valuations.","authors":["Martin Hoefer"],"meta":["October 2014ACM Transactions on Internet Technology 14(2-3):16","DOI:10.1145/2663496"],"references":["232238057_The_Power_of_Non-Uniform_Wireless_Power","224500426_Capacity_of_Arbitrary_Wireless_Networks","222547302_Bundling_Equilibrium_in_Combinatorial_Auctions","221163994_Statistical_bandwidth_sharing_A_study_of_congestion_at_flow_level","221036596_Strong_Edge_Coloring_for_Channel_Assignment_in_Wireless_Radio_Networks","220926364_eBay_in_the_Sky_Strategy-proof_wireless_spectrum_auctions","220430834_Truthful_and_Near-Optimal_Mechanism_Design_via_Linear_Programming","220292426_Models_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Channel_Assignment_in_Radio_Networks","51948856_Secondary_Spectrum_Auctions_for_Symmetric_and_Submodular_Bidders","47461015_Wireless_Capacity_with_Oblivious_Power_in_General_Metrics","47438379_Wireless_Scheduling_with_Power_Control","45931850_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Secondary_Spectrum_Auctions","4194077_Demand_responsive_pricing_and_competitive_spectrum_allocation_via_spectrum_server","4150990_DIMSUMNet_New_directions_in_wireless_networking_using_coordinated_dynamic_spectrum_access","3235922_The_Distance-2_Matching_Problem_and_Its_Relationship_to_the_MAC-Layer_Capacity_of_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","2495397_Bundling_Equilibrium_in_Combinatorial_Auctions","2401734_Opportunity_Cost_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Auctions","285926831_Secondary_Spectrum_Auctions_with_Symmetric_and_Submodular_Bidders","266435524_Algorithmic_game_theory_Foreword_by_Christos_H_Papadimitriou","262244062_Truthfulness_and_Stochastic_Dominance_with_Monetary_Transfers","262204533_Brief_announcement_Universally_Truthful_Secondary_Spectrum_Auctions","258222947_Algorithmic_Game_Theory","254032137_Truthful_spectrum_auction_design_for_secondary_networks","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","228527928_Enabling_Spectrum_Sharing_in_Secondary_Market_Auctions","226634450_Distributed_Contention_Resolution_in_Wireless_Networks","224907354_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Link_Scheduling_with_Flexible_DataRates","224678314_Approximation_algorithms_for_allocation_problems_Improving_the_factor_of_1_-_1e","224500347_TRUST_A_General_Framework_for_Truthful_Double_Spectrum_Auctions","223570821_Truthful_randomized_mechanisms_for_combinatorial_auctions","223118054_Efficient_Bounds_for_the_Stable_Set_Vertex_Cover_and_Set_Packing_Problems","222533223_NeXt_GenerationDynamic_Spectrum_AccessCognitive_Radio_Wireless_Networks_A_Survey","222404159_Towards_Real-Time_Dynamic_Spectrum_Auctions","221628412_Multiflows_in_multihop_wireless_networks","221591306_Optimal_approximation_for_the_Submodular_Welfare_Problem_in_the_value_oracle_model","221428786_Disk_Graphs_A_Short_Survey","221344184_Oblivious_Interference_Scheduling","221244634_Strategyproof_auctions_for_balancing_social_welfare_and_fairness_in_secondary_spectrum_markets","220853168_Truthful_Mechanisms_for_Exhibitions","220570377_Approximation_algorithms_for_the_weighted_independent_set_problem_in_sparse_graphs","220223818_On_Coloring_Unit_Disk_Graphs","220150114_Improved_algorithms_for_latency_minimization_in_wireless_networks","220139071_Online_Capacity_Maximization_in_Wireless_Networks","45928429_A_Constant-Factor_Approximation_for_Wireless_Capacity_Maximization_with_Power_Control_in_the_SINR_Model","5224061_Combinatorial_Auctions","3236734_Competitive_Pricing_for_Spectrum_Sharing_in_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_Dynamic_Game_Inefficiency_of_Nash_Equilibrium_and_Collusion","3236418_Joint_Channel_Assignment_and_Routing_for_Throughput_Optimization_in_Multiradio_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","3080038_The_Capacity_of_Wireless_Networks","2834088_Non-Approximability_Results_for_Optimization_Problems_on_Bounded_Degree_Instances"]}
