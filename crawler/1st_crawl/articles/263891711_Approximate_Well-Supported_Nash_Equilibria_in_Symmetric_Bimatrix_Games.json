{"id":"263891711_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_in_Symmetric_Bimatrix_Games","abstract":"The $\\varepsilon$-well-supported Nash equilibrium is a strong notion of\napproximation of a Nash equilibrium, where no player has an incentive greater\nthan $\\varepsilon$ to deviate from any of the pure strategies that she uses in\nher mixed strategy. The smallest constant $\\varepsilon$ currently known for\nwhich there is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an\n$\\varepsilon$-well-supported Nash equilibrium in bimatrix games is slightly\nbelow $2/3$. In this paper we study this problem for symmetric bimatrix games\nand we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that gives a\n$(1/2+\\delta)$-well-supported Nash equilibrium, for an arbitrarily small\npositive constant $\\delta$.","authors":["Artur Czumaj","Michail Fasoulakis","Marcin Jurdzinski"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44803-8_21","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory","Project: The Computational Complexity of Approximate Nash Equilibria"],"references":["225754383_Well_Supported_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","221591740_The_complexity_of_computing_a_Nash_equilibrium","220853479_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220616737_The_Complexity_of_Computing_a_Nash_Equilibrium","220465612_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","200033999_Progress_in_approximate_nash_equilibria","268606354_On_symmetric_games","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","228108257_Non-Cooperative_Games","222871046_On_sparse_approximations_to_randomized_strategies_and_convex_combinations","222101118_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_Below_Two-Thirds","222069855_A_note_on_approximate_Nash_equilibria","221131570_Approximability_of_Symmetric_Bimatrix_Games_and_Related_Experiments","41386442_New_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
