{"id":"318785369_Efficient_Deformable_Shape_Correspondence_via_Kernel_Matching","abstract":"We present a method to match three dimensional shapes under non-isometric deformations, topology changes and partiality. We formulate the problem as matching between a set of pair-wise and point-wise descriptors, imposing a continuity prior on the mapping, and propose a projected descent optimization procedure inspired by difference of convex functions (DC) programming. Surprisingly, in spite of the highly non-convex nature of the resulting quadratic assignment problem, our method converges to a semantically meaningful and continuous mapping in most of our experiments, and scales well. We provide preliminary theoretical analysis and several interpretations of the method.","authors":["Amit Boyarski","Alex Bronstein","Michael Bronstein","Daniel Cremers"],"meta":["July 2017","Projects: Efficient Deformable Shape Correspondence via Kernel MatchingNon-Rigid Shape Correspondence"],"references":["316538597_Deep_Functional_Maps_Structured_Prediction_for_Dense_Shape_Correspondence","312043121_Product_Manifold_Filter_Non-Rigid_Shape_Correspondence_via_Kernel_Density_Estimation_in_the_Product_Space","310953386_Geometric_deep_learning_on_graphs_and_manifolds_using_mixture_model_CNNs","303439117_Learning_shape_correspondence_with_anisotropic_convolutional_neural_networks","299979488_SHREC'16_Matching_of_Deformable_Shapes_with_Topological_Noise","320971351_Product_Manifold_Filter_Non-rigid_Shape_Correspondence_via_Kernel_Density_Estimation_in_the_Product_Space","317749625_Fully_Spectral_Partial_Shape_Matching","314727241_Functional_maps_a_flexible_representation_of_maps_between_shapes","310671810_Geodesic_Distance_Descriptors","284114049_Learning_the_geometry_of_common_latent_variables_using_alternating-diffusion"]}
