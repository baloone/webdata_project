{"id":"330105795_U-Turning_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_for_Solving_Symmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","abstract":"This paper provides a new Ant based algorithms called U-Turning Ant colony optimization (U-TACO) for solving a well-known NP-Hard problem, which is widely used in computer science field called Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Generally U-Turning Ant colony Optimization Algorithm makesa partial tour as an initial state for the basic conventional Ant Colony algorithm. This paper provides tables and charts for the results obtained by U-Turning Ant colony Optimization for various TSP problems from the TSPLIB95.","authors":["Saman M.
