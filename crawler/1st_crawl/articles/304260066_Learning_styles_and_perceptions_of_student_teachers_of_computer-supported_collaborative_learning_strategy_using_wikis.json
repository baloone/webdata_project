{"id":"304260066_Learning_styles_and_perceptions_of_student_teachers_of_computer-supported_collaborative_learning_strategy_using_wikis","abstract":"This paper reports the results of an attempt to integrate a collaborative technology, Wiki, into learning within a course in a teacher education programme based on social constructivist learning theory. The current study aimed to explore student-teacher acceptance of the proposed pedagogy and to identify specific learning style preferences that might be favourable to accepting the proposed pedagogy. A total of 56 student teachers participated in this study. They completed a number of collaborative tasks using a wiki during the learning process, and were then invited to complete a questionnaire designed to solicit their perception on the usefulness of wikis and their attitudes towards using a wiki, and 39 of them also returned a learning styles inventory which was used to identify the learning styles profile of the student-teacher samples. The findings reveal favourable perceptions of the use of a wiki as a collaborative learning tool in the course. Qualitative data collected from open-ended questions also reflects similar favourable results. Active learners were also found to be significantly different from reflective learners in accepting the wiki as a learning tool.","authors":["Kai Ming LI"],"meta":["February 2015Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 31(1)","DOI:10.14742/ajet.521"],"references":["312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","279894244_Applications_reliability_and_validity_of_the_Index_of_Learning_Styles","273718758_The_Effect_on_Pulmonary_Indices_of_Surfactant_Therapy_for_Meconium_Aspiration_Syndrome_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis","264224326_Understanding_Student_Differences","257431200_Learning_and_Teaching_Styles_in_Engineering_Education","254335984_Constructivism_as_a_Theoretical_Foundation_for_the_Use_of_Technology_in_Social_Studies","252241255_Constructivism_versus_objectivism_Implications_for_interaction_course_design_and_evaluation_in_distance_education","242098273_Constructivism_and_Computer-Mediated_Communication_in_Distance_Education","239573605_Reaching_the_Second_Tier_Learning_and_Teaching_Styles_in_College_Science_Education","238681487_Searching_for_Learner-Centered_Constructivist_and_Sociocultural_Components_of_Collaborative_Educational_Learning_Tools","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","234800035_CSCL_in_higher_education_a_framework_for_designing_multiple_collaborative_environments","228403640_Index_of_Learning_Styles_Questionnaire","227447282_A_Theoretical_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_Four_Longitudinal_Field_Studies","221033816_Exploring_foundations_for_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","221033719_Learning_and_knowledge_building_with_social_software","321568182_The_Role_of_Technology_in_CSCL_Studies_in_Technology_Enhanced_Collaborative_Learning","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","292981243_Constructivism_in_Education","284650551_From_a_focus_on_tasks_to_a_focus_on_understanding_The_cultural_transformation_of_a_Toronto_classroom","272566220_Teaching_Secondary_Students_through_Their_Individual_Learning_Styles_Practical_Approaches_for_Grades_7_-_12","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","263464369_User_acceptance_of_information_technology_System_characteristics_user_perceptions_and_behavioral_impacts","259823113_Quickiwiki_Swiki_Twiki_Zwiki_and_the_Plone_Wars_Wiki_as_a_PIM_and_collaborative_content_tool","254338425_Sharing_Our_Toys_Cooperative_Learning_Versus_Collaborative_Learning","250185415_Chapter_1_Individual_and_Social_Aspects_of_Learning","246483098_Instructional_Technology_Learning_Styles_and_Academic_Achievement","245891210_Designing_Groupwork_Strategies_for_the_Heterogeneous_Classroom","244441072_Should_We_Be_Using_Learning_Styles_What_Research_Has_to_Say_to_Practice","243781107_Learning_style_An_overview","243775397_The_collected_works_of_L","243765883_Thinking_Technology_Toward_a_constructivist_design_model","242380080_CSCL_Theory_and_Practice_of_an_Emerging_Paradigm","239982711_Experience_as_the_Source_of_Learning_and_Development","239802824_Planning_for_Neomillennial_Learning_Styles_Implications_for_Investments_in_Technology_and_Faculty","238688549_Learning_Networks_A_Field_Guide_to_Teaching_and_Learning_Online","238004471_A_Contribution_to_Validation_of_Score_Meaning_for_Felder_Soloman's_Index_of_Learning_Styles","232449981_Cooperation_and_Competition_Theory_and_Research","231513994_Toward_A_Theory_of_Instruction","229068230_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_mental_processes","228012065_The_Effects_of_Cooperative_Group_Work_Versus_Independent_Practice_on_the_Learning_of_Some_Problem-Solving_Strategies","227129126_Social_interaction_in_the_acquisition_of_knowledge","226933851_CSCL_in_Higher_Education","226261458_Collaborative_learning_the_wiki_way","225684377_Cooperative_learning_in_computer-based_instruction","223933040_Strategies_for_collaborative_writing_and_phases_of_knowledge_construction_in_CSCL_environments","223723485_Meaningful_interaction_in_Web-based_learning_A_social_constructivist_interpretation","222685425_The_influence_of_system_characteristics_on_E-learning_use","222084522_The_effect_of_learning_styles_on_the_navigation_needs_of_Web-based_learners","220309251_Online_moderation_of_synchronous_e-argumentation","220309144_Scaffolding_problem-based_learning_with_CSCL_tools","200773431_The_CSILE_project_Trying_to_bring_the_classroom_into_World_3","220174815_CSCL_2_Carrying_forward_the_conversation","220040297_Psychology_of_Learning_for_Instruction"]}
