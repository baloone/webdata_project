Woodward presents an account of causal explanation. We argue, by using an explanation of Kleiber’s law to illustrate, that the account can also cover some noncausal explanations. This leads to a tension between the two key aspects of Woodward’s account: the counterfactual aspect and the causal aspect. We explore this tension and make a case for jettisoning the causal aspect as constitutive of explanatory power in connection with regularity explananda.","authors":["JT Saatsi","Mark Pexton"],"meta":["December 2013"],"references":["226554441_Dissecting_explanatory_power","12943322_The_Fourth_Dimension_of_Life_Fractal_Geometry_and_Allometric_Scaling_of_Organisms","262334166_The_origin_of_universal_scaling_laws_in_biology","246751060_Making_Things_Happen_A_Theory_of_Causal_Explanation","228021437_Explanatory_Generalizations_Part_I_A_Counterfactual_Account","228008151_Explanatory_Generalizations_Part_II_Plumbing_Explanatory_Depth","220607302_How_Scientific_Models_Can_Explain","31171209_Can_Classical_Structures_Explain_Quantum_Phenomena"]}
