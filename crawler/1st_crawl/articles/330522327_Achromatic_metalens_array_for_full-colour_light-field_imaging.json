{"id":"330522327_Achromatic_metalens_array_for_full-colour_light-field_imaging","abstract":"A light-field camera captures both the intensity and the direction of incoming light1–5. This enables a user to refocus pictures and afterwards reconstruct information on the depth of field. Research on light-field imaging can be divided into two components: acquisition and rendering. Microlens arrays have been used for acquisition, but obtaining broadband achromatic images with no spherical aberration remains challenging. Here, we describe a metalens array made of gallium nitride (GaN) nanoantennas⁶ that can be used to capture light-field information and demonstrate a full-colour light-field camera devoid of chromatic aberration. The metalens array contains an array of 60 × 60 metalenses with diameters of 21.65 μm. The camera has a diffraction-limited resolution of 1.95 μm under white light illumination. The depth of every object in the scene can be reconstructed slice by slice from a series of rendered images with different depths of focus. Full-colour, achromatic light-field cameras could find applications in a variety of fields such as robotic vision, self-driving vehicles and virtual and augmented reality. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","authors":["Ren Jie Lin","Vin-Cent Su","Shuming Wang","Mu Ku Chen"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Nanotechnology 14(3)","DOI:10.1038/s41565-018-0347-0"],"references":["322832487_A_broadband_achromatic_metalens_in_the_visible","318910494_Broadband_achromatic_optical_metasurface_devices","311724802_Plenoptic_mapping_for_imaging_and_retrieval_of_the_complex_field_amplitude_of_a_laser_beam","326419366_Metalenses_Advances_and_Applications","324593562_Integrated_Resonant_Unit_of_Metasurfaces_for_Broadband_Efficiency_and_Phase_Manipulation","319635972_GaN_Metalens_for_Pixel-Level_Full-Color_Routing_at_Visible_Light","318610574_Fresnel_zone_plate_light_field_spectral_imaging","316525312_Light_field_endoscopy_and_its_parametric_description","316345836_Point_spread_function_and_depth-invariant_focal_sweep_point_spread_function_for_plenoptic_camera_20","313745002_Geometric_Calibration_of_Micro-Lens-Based_Light_Field_Cameras_Using_Line_Features","303779506_Metalenses_at_visible_wavelengths_Diffraction-limited_focusing_and_subwavelength_resolution_imaging","303359298_Depth_estimation_and_camera_calibration_of_a_focused_plenoptic_camera_for_visual_odometry","302982361_Compressive_light-field_microscopy_for_3D_neural_activity_recording","301686425_Super-Dispersive_Off-Axis_Meta-Lenses_for_Compact_High_Resolution_Spectroscopy","295898841_Super-resolution_in_a_defocused_plenoptic_camera_A_wave-optics-based_approach"]}
