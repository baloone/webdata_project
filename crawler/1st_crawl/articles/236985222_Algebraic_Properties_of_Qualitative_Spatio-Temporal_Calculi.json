{"id":"236985222_Algebraic_Properties_of_Qualitative_Spatio-Temporal_Calculi","abstract":"Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning is based on so-called qualitative\ncalculi. Algebraic properties of these calculi have several implications on\nreasoning algorithms. But what exactly is a qualitative calculus? And to which\nextent do the qualitative calculi proposed meet these demands? The literature\nprovides various answers to the first question but only few facts about the\nsecond. In this paper we identify the minimal requirements to binary\nspatio-temporal calculi and we discuss the relevance of the according axioms\nfor representation and reasoning. We also analyze existing qualitative calculi\nand provide a classification involving different notions of a relation algebra.","authors":["Frank Dylla","Till Mossakowski","Thomas Schneider","Diedrich Wolter"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-01790-7_28","SourcearXiv","Conference: Spatial Information Theory (COSIT 2013)At: Scarborough, North Yorkshire, UK"],"references":["263078826_Spatial_reasoning_with_rectangular_cardinal_relations_The_convex_tractable_subalgebra","250262314_SparQ_User_Manual_V06","238670854_A_Complete_Classification_of_Tractability_in_RCC5","303657421_Relations_Between_Spatial_Calculi_About_Directions_and_Orientations","286195972_Constraint_Processing","283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals","278858414_Qualitative_spatial_reasoning_Cardinal_directions_as_an_example","268615024_Studies_in_Logic_and_the_Foundations_of_Mathematics","251470850_Chapter_13_Qualitative_Spatial_Representation_and_Reasoning","251448765_Qualitative_Reasoning_about_Relative_Direction_of_Oriented_Points"]}
