{"id":"325161554_A_collection_of_public_transport_network_data_sets_for_25_cities","abstract":"Various public transport (PT) agencies publish their route and timetable information with the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) as the standard open format. Timetable data are commonly used for PT passenger routing. They can also be used for studying the structure and organization of PT networks, as well as the accessibility and the level of service these networks provide. However, using raw GTFS data is challenging as researchers need to understand the details of the GTFS data format, make sure that the data contain all relevant modes of public transport, and have no errors. To lower the barrier for using GTFS data in research, we publish a curated collection of 25 cities' public transport networks in multiple easy-to-use formats including network edge lists, temporal network event lists, SQLite databases, GeoJSON files, and the GTFS data format. This collection promotes the study of how PT is organized across the globe, and also provides a testbed for developing tools for PT network analysis and PT routing algorithms.","authors":["Rainer Kujala","Christoffer Weckstr√∂m","Richard K.
