{"id":"337678442_Note_on_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_with_applications","abstract":"In the paper, “Bipolar fuzzy graphs with applications” by Akram (2013), Definitions 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.3 and Theorem 3.16 contain some flaws. In this note, we show by examples that these definitions and theorem are not correct. The updated version of these definitions and theorem have been established in this paper with numerical examples.","authors":["Soumitra Poulik","Ganesh Ghorai"],"meta":["February 2020Knowledge-Based Systems 192:1-5","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105315"],"references":["327777288_Detour_g-interior_nodes_and_detour_g-boundary_nodes_in_bipolar_fuzzy_graph_with_applications","283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","264194081_3_Order_and_size_in_fuzzy_Graph","254399182_On_Regular_Fuzzy_Graphs","235319619_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","3595993_Bipolar_fuzzy_sets_and_relations_a_computational_framework_for_cognitive_modeling_and_multiagent_decision_analysis","257391468_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_with_applications","256721451_Notes_on_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
