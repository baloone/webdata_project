{"id":"44277544_Let_there_a_brief_history_of_legal_information_retrieval","abstract":"This paper charts the growth of national and global legal information systems including both commercial systems such as LEXIS, state funded national systems and free access systems such as those represented under theWorldLII umbrella. It suggests that the vision of an integrated national electronic information system was always likely to remain unfulfilled because of changes in technology and complexity of jurisdictions. In the circumstances the paper suggests both pluralism and the development of global co-operation.","authors":["Jon Bing"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
