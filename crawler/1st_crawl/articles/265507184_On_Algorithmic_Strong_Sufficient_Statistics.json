{"id":"265507184_On_Algorithmic_Strong_Sufficient_Statistics","abstract":"The notion of a strong sufficient statistic was introduced in [8]. In this paper, we give a survey of nice properties of strong sufficient statistics and show that there are strings for which complexity of every strong sufficient statistic is much larger than complexity of its minimal sufficient statistic.","authors":["Nikolay Vereshchagin"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-39053-1_50","Conference: Conference on Computability in Europe"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","262358606_Game_Arguments_in_Computability_Theory_and_Algorithmic_Information_Theory","234066608_Short_Lists_with_Short_Programs_in_Short_Time","31053785_Discussion_on_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Statistical_Analysis","3085256_Kolmogorov's_Structure_Functions_and_Model_Selection","3080492_Algorithmic_Statistics","221652732_Algorithmic_Minimal_Sufficient_Statistic_Revisited"]}
