Furthermore, we also exploit motion information from dense trajectories to boost the discriminative power of the proposed descriptor. Experiments on various benchmarks validate the interest of our approach.","authors":["Thanh Tuan Nguyen","Phuong Thanh Nguyen","Frédéric Bouchara","Xuan Son Nguyen"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01449-0_7","In book: Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems (pp.74-86)"],"references":["322466498_Action_recognition_in_depth_videos_using_hierarchical_gaussian_descriptor","316748612_Local_Derivative_Pattern_for_Action_Recognition_in_Depth_Images","315116628_Convolutional_Neural_Network_on_Three_Orthogonal_Planes_for_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","304357317_Topological_Attribute_Patterns_for_Texture_Recognition","295173717_Improved_Weber's_law_based_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","273568840_Spatial_motion_patterns_Action_models_from_semi-dense_trajectories","263813576_Optimizing_LBP_Structure_For_Visual_Recognition_Using_Binary_Quadratic_Programming","257672334_Dense_Trajectories_and_Motion_Boundary_Descriptors_for_Action_Recognition","224611962_Local_Derivative_Pattern_Versus_Local_Binary_Pattern_Face_Recognition_With_High-Order_Local_Pattern_Descriptor","222614245_DynTex_A_comprehensive_database_of_dynamic_textures","221304045_Maximum_Margin_Distance_Learning_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","3940791_Dynamic_texture_recognition","2377941_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","323712753_Completed_local_structure_patterns_on_three_orthogonal_planes_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","319605650_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Volume_Local_Binary_Count_Patterns_With_an_Application_to_2D_Face_Spoofing_Detection","311978037_Dynamic_Texture_Representation_Using_a_Deep_Multi-Scale_Convolutional_Network","311611053_Equiangular_Kernel_Dictionary_Learning_with_Applications_to_Dynamic_Texture_Analysis","310735568_Dynamic_texture_recognition_using_multiresolution_edge-weighted_local_structure_pattern","301761593_A_novel_scheme_based_on_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","300412827_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_via_Orthogonal_Tensor_Dictionary_Learning","282409762_Statistical_binary_patterns_for_rotational_invariant_texture_classification","276164399_Classifying_Dynamic_Textures_via_Spatiotemporal_Fractal_Analysis","273529088_Chaotic_features_for_dynamic_textures_recognition","273528138_Dynamic_texture_recognition_based_on_completed_volume_local_binary_pattern","273393002_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Multiscale_Binarized_Statistical_Image_Features","273308875_Spatiotemporal_Directional_Number_Transitional_Graph_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","271771514_Dynamic_texture_and_scene_classification_by_transferring_deep_image_features","262149717_A_Novel_Local_Pattern_Descriptor-Local_Vector_Pattern_in_High-Order_Derivative_Space_for_Face_Recognition","257484783_Scale-space_texture_description_on_SIFT-like_textons","230713633_Wavelet_Domain_Multifractal_Analysis_for_Static_and_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","221361369_View-Invariant_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_using_a_Bag_of_Dynamical_Systems","6397809_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns_with_an_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","5602029_Synergizing_spatial_and_temporal_texture","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
