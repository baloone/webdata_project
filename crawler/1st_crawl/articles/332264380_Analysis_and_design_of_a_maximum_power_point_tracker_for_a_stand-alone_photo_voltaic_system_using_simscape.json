While the \"Perturb and Observe\" technique, as an MPPT algorithm, has many advantages, it also has some disadvantages. The widely used technique is simulated and the results are compared with those of other techniques for PV system performance evaluation. The photovoltaic characteristics, I-V & P-V curves are obtained for different solar irradiance values with ambiant cell temperature. Perturb and observe (P&O) and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) algorithms are described and the PV characteristics are obtained for fixed values of solar insulation and temperature for the PV system with a DC-to-DC Cuk convertor.
