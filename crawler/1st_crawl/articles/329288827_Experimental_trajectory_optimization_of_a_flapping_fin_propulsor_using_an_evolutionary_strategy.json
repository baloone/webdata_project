{"id":"329288827_Experimental_trajectory_optimization_of_a_flapping_fin_propulsor_using_an_evolutionary_strategy","abstract":"The experimental optimization of bio-inspired flapping fin trajectories are demonstrated for potential applications as a side or a rear propulsor of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The trajectories are scored based upon their difference from a force set-point and upon their efficiency and are parameterized by 10 variables inspired by fish swimming. The flapping fin is a generic rectangular rigid flat plate with a tapered edge. Optimization occurs as follows. First, a generation of trajectories is created. Second, the trajectories are executed by a spherical parallel manipulator, during which the forces are acquired. Third, the trajectories are scored and a new generation of trajectories is created using the covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy. This loop repeats ad-infinitum until the search converges. Within the first set of searches, two trajectories for optimal side-force generation are found, one is fully three-dimensional while the other is artificially constrained to a line, and one trajectory for optimal thrust generation is found. All searches demonstrate good convergence properties and match the desired force set-point almost immediately. Additional generations primarily improve the efficiency of the maneuver. The two trajectories for generating side-force have a similar efficiency, which shows potential in utilizing a simple trajectory limited to a line. Comparison between the trajectories for generating side-force and thrust suggests that side-force generation is more efficient around Re ~1000, based on the average tip velocity and length of the fin. The second set of searches explores the behavior of the optimal trajectories for generating side-force at a lower force set-point and the third set of searches explores the sensitivity and repeatability of the optimization.","authors":["Nathan Martin","Morteza Gharib"],"meta":["November 2018Bioinspiration & Biomimetics 14(1):016010","DOI:10.1088/1748-3190/aaefa5"],"references":["278398067_Thrust_performance_of_a_flexible_low-aspect-ratio_pitching_plate","261353200_Application_of_a_micro-genetic_algorithm_for_gait_development_on_a_bio-inspired_robotic_pectoral_fin","258012055_Experiment-Based_Optimization_of_Flapping_Wing_Kinematics","253907074_Wake_mechanics_for_thrust_generation_in_oscillating_foils","245425471_Optimization_of_Flapping_Airfoils_For_Maximum_Thrust_and_Propulsive_Efficiency","227661693_Kinematics_of_swimming_of_penguins_at_the_Detroit_Zoo","51998166_Energy-Minizing_Kinematics_in_Hovering_Insect_Flight","26804454_On_the_evolution_of_the_wake_structure_produced_by_a_low-aspect-ratio_pitching_panel","26804451_The_wake_structure_and_thrust_performance_of_a_rigid_low-aspect-ratio_pitching_panel","10710734_Reducing_the_Time_Complexity_of_the_Derandomized_Evolution_Strategy_with_Covariance_Matrix_Adaptation_CMA-ES","6809620_Pectoral_fin_coordination_and_gait_transitions_in_steadily_swimming_juvenile_reef_fishes","5809503_Artificial_evolution_of_the_morphology_and_kinematics_in_a_flapping-wing_mini-UAV","3231079_Review_of_Fish_Swimming_Modes_for_Aquatic_Locomotion","277473825_A_review_of_developments_towards_biologically_inspired_propulsion_systems_for_autonomous_underwater_vehicles","258796436_Numerical_study_of_large_amplitude_nonsinusoidal_motion_and_camber_effects_on_pitching_airfoil_propulsion","244954041_A_Comparison_of_the_Swimming_of_Marine_and_Freshwater_Turtles","243778672_Pectoral_Fin_Locomotion_in_Fishes_Testing_Drag-based_Models_Using_Three-dimensional_Kinematics","239414563_Modelization_and_Kinematics_Optimization_for_a_Flapping-Wing_Microair_Vehicle","234405929_Vortical_Patterns_in_the_Wake_of_an_Oscillating_Airfoil","234047308_The_Optimum_Kinematic_Design_of_a_Spherical_Three-Degree-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulator","234047292_On_the_Direct_Kinematics_of_Spherical_Three-Degree-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulators_of_General_Architecture","233616735_The_Present_State_of_Autonomous_Underwater_Vehicle_AUV_Applications_and_Technologies","233590764_2007_MTS_Overview_of_Manned_Underwater_Vehicle_Activity","231965160_Vortex_wakes_of_a_flapping_foil","229742197_Fish_functional_design_and_swimming_performance","227682742_Gait_transition_and_oxygen_consumption_in_swimming_striped_surfperch_Embiotoca_lateralis_Agassiz","226703913_Design_and_Control_of_Autonomous_Underwater_Robots_A_Survey","220375075_Completely_Derandomized_Self-Adaptation_in_Evolution_Strategies","47791372_The_effect_of_fin_ray_flexural_rigidity_on_the_propulsive_forces_generated_by_a_biorobotic_fish_pectoral_fin","3847300_Underwater_robotics_Out_of_the_research_laboratory_and_into_the_field"]}
