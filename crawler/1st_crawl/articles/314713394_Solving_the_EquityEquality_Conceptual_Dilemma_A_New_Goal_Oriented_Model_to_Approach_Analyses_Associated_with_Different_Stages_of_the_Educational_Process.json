{"id":"314713394_Solving_the_EquityEquality_Conceptual_Dilemma_A_New_Goal_Oriented_Model_to_Approach_Analyses_Associated_with_Different_Stages_of_the_Educational_Process","abstract":"A survey of recent and earlier debates on “equity” and “equality” reveals disagreement and confusion about what those concepts really mean and what they involve in terms of goals and results. By creating a new equality- equity goal oriented model, which allows us to combine different dimensions for each concept with different stages of the educational process, this article aims to achieve two purposes: a) to clarify among researchers, educators, evaluators, policy analysts, and policymakers the notions of “equality” and “equity”; and b) to encourage researchers and evaluators to critically examine and synthesise equality/equitybased research. Certainly, the debate about “equity” and “equality” in education can only be settled if these fundamental aspects are resolved.","authors":["Oscar Espinoza"],"meta":["January 2007Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice 29(1):75-96","DOI:10.7459/ept/29.1.07"],"references":[]}
