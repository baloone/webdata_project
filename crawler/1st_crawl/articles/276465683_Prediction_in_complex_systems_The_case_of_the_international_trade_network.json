{"id":"276465683_Prediction_in_complex_systems_The_case_of_the_international_trade_network","abstract":"Predicting the future evolution of complex systems is one of the main\nchallenges in complexity science. Based on a current snapshot of a network,\nlink prediction algorithms aim to predict its future evolution. We apply here\nlink prediction algorithms to data on the international trade between\ncountries. This data can be represented as a complex network where links\nconnect countries with the products that they export. Link prediction\ntechniques based on heat and mass diffusion processes are employed to obtain\npredictions for products exported in the future. These baseline predictions are\nimproved using a recent metric of country fitness and product similarity. The\noverall best results are achieved with a newly developed metric of product\nsimilarity which takes advantage of causality in the network evolution.","authors":["Alexandre Vidmer","An Zeng","Matus Medo","Yi-Cheng Zhang"],"meta":["May 2015Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 436","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2015.05.057"],"references":["266376764_On_the_convergence_of_the_Fitness-Complexity_Algorithm","264673886_How_the_Taxonomy_of_Products_Drives_the_Economic_Development_of_Countries","256327142_Information_filtering_via_hybridization_of_similarity_preferential_diffusion_processes","255791080_Measuring_the_Intangibles_A_Metrics_for_the_Economic_Complexity_of_Countries_and_Products","249172651_Structural_Position_in_the_World_System_and_Economic_Growth_1955-1970_A_Multiple-Network_Analysis_of_Transnational_Interactions","232233495_A_New_Metrics_for_Countries'_Fitness_and_Products'_Complexity","221654586_Combining_predictions_for_accurate_recommender_systems","51909425_The_reinforcing_influence_of_recommendations_on_global_diversification","51586699_Emergence_of_Scale-Free_Leadership_Structure_in_Social_Recommender_Systems","46462033_The_International_Trade_Network_Weighted_Network_Analysis_and_Modelling","46461877_The_International-Trade_Network_Gravity_Equations_and_Topological_Properties","45879135_Adaptive_model_for_recommendation_of_news","41532378_Solving_the_apparent_diversity-accuracy_dilemma_of_recommender_systems","26314327_The_Building_Blocks_of_Economic_Complexity","12779869_Albert_R_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks_Science_286_509-512","12290611_The_Large-Scale_Organization_of_Metabolic_Networks","6181618_The_Product_Space_Conditions_the_Development_of_Nations","6015530_Species_status_of_Neisseria_gonorrhoeae_Evolutionary_and_epidemiological_inferences_from_multilocus_sequence_typing","5852039_Heat_Conduction_Process_on_Community_Networks_as_a_Recommendation_Model","5851936_Bipartite_network_projection_and_personal_recommendation","4901704_The_Variety_and_Quality_of_A_Nation's_Trade","2369002_Item-based_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Algorithms","330325934_The_Atlas_of_Economic_Complexity_Mapping_Paths_to_Prosperity","324299096_Shaping_the_World_Economy","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","281253875_An_Overview_of_the_New_Frontiers_of_Economic_Complexity","270905856_Consistence_beats_causality_in_recommender_systems","260799584_Information_filtering_by_similarity-preferential_diffusion_processes","260416644_Error_Detecting_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","238799778_Recommender_systems_Commun_ACM","229754008_Trade_Liberalisation_and_Revealed_Comparative_Advantage1","228691203_The_Netflix_Prize","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","223272691_Link_Prediction_and_Path_Analysis_using_Markov_Chains","222463267_Networks_Versus_Markets_in_International_Trade","221662122_Recommender_Systems","221653815_Collaborative_filtering_with_temporal_dynamics","220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge","220424836_Collaborative_Filtering_with_Temporal_Dynamics","47326911_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks_A_Survey","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","11881412_Scientific_collaboration_networks_I_Network_construction_and_fundamental_results","11846504_Random_Graphs_with_Arbitrary_Degree_Distributions_and_their_Applications","10600697_Topology_of_the_World_Trade_Web","5149819_What_You_Export_Matters","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks"]}
