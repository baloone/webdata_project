{"id":"251958604_A_realization_of_pervasive_computing_Ubiquitous_city","abstract":"Ubiquitous technologies are becoming an increasing part of people's lives. Issues and challenges for the development of such technologies not only encompass a broad spectrum of applications and services but also involve the envisioning of new policies and legislations that will change the way in which we live and work. This study provides an overview of the socio-technical vision of ubiquitous computing by analyzing Korea's ubiquitous city development cases. The study conceptualizes ubiquitous computing by illustrating current ongoing projects in order to give socio-technical insights on the nature and scope of ubiquitous computing. This study illustrates how ubiquitous computing is interpreted and reflected in South Korea's policy-making arena. The findings of this study provide a prospect toward a future information infrastructure in the context of dynamic socio-technical changes.","authors":["Donghee Shin"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["3940463_A_New_Code-disjoint_Sum-bit_Duplicated_Carry_Look-ahead_Adder_for_Parity_Codes","3903891_Self-repairable_EPLDs_II_Advanced_self-repairing_methodology","234801560_Concurrent_Error_Detection_for_Group_Look-ahead_Binary_Adders","232641034_Reconfigurable_Computing_and_Electronic_Nanotechnology","3925229_On-line_error_detectable_carry-free_adder_design","3924932_Architectures_for_reliable_computing_with_unreliable_nanodevices","3905898_Novel_fault-tolerant_adder_design_for_FPGA-based_systems","3783214_Built_in_self_repair_for_embedded_high_density_SRAM","3512892_Concurrent_error_detection_in_ALUs_by_recomputing_with_rotated_operands","3048019_Concurrent_Error_Detection_in_ALU's_by_Recomputing_with_Shifted_Operands","3042546_Fault_Tolerance_in_Linear_Systolic_Arrays_Using_Time_Redundancy","2975299_Efficient_use_of_Time_and_Hardware_Redundancy_for_Concurrent_Error_Detection_in_A_32-bit_VLSI_Adder"]}
