{"id":"303041230_Enhancing_Spatio-Temporal_Identity_States_of_Existence_and_Presence","abstract":"This work presents a new approach that aims to characterize the spatio-temporal relationships that exist between geographical objects that are absent or non-existent at the moment of analysis. First, we would like to propose a formal analysis of the spatio-temporal states of presence and existence of a geographical object. We will then use a combination of these states in order to define a set of life and motion configurations. The model developed then serves as a formal basis for the realization of a series of spatio-temporal queries based on an analysis of patterns in the succession of spatio-temporal states. The entire approach is then demonstrated by using the example of the organization of a scientific conference by defining the spatio-temporal relationships between the conference participants. The research methodology is finally compared with a real dataset taken from a geolocalized social network to show the efficiency of this type of management.","authors":["Pierre Hallot","Roland Billen"],"meta":["May 2016International Journal of Geo-Information 5(5):62","DOI:10.3390/ijgi5050062"],"references":["285676782_Categorizing_binary_topological_relations_between_regions_lines_and_points_in_geographic_databases_the_9-intersection_Formalism_and_its_Use_for_Naturallanguage_Spatial_Predicates","284392413_Toward_semantics_for_modeling_spatiotemporal_processes_within_gisc","283006849_Les_etats_spatiotemporels_d'existence_et_de_presence_Vers_une_definition_des_relations_entre_objets_absents_ou_inexistants","276959705_Point_Set_Topological_Spatial_Relations","257793036_Representing_mereotopological_relations_in_OWL_ontologies_with_ONTOPARTS","321602119_Spatial_and_Temporal_Reasoning","305261608_Object_Identity","283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals","278955148_Innovation_Diffusion_as_a_Spatial_Process","259556627_Thinking_about_Space-Time_Connections_Spatiotemporal_Scheduling_of_Individual_Activities","245016374_A_qualitative_representation_of_evolving_spatial_entities_in_two-dimensional_spaces","243784051_On_the_expression_of_spatiotemporal_relations_in_language","242637098_Categorizing_binary_topological_relationships_between_regions","235006731_Generalized_Life_and_Motion_Configuration_reasoning_model","235006733_L'identite_a_travers_l'espace_et_le_temps_Vers_une_definition_de_l'identite_et_des_relations_spatio-temporelles_entre_objets_geographiques"]}
