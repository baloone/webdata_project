{"id":"317052876_Positivistic_Tendencies_Due_to_Engineering_Education","abstract":"In this research it is claimed that engineering education increases the positivistic tendencies of students regarding to the social problems. A theoretical background is given in the introduction and literature review. Two hypotheses are constructed and a micro-questionnaire survey is performed to test the hypotheses. In the survey positivistic tendencies of engineering students and social science students are compared. The results are depicted and discussed in detail. One of the hypotheses was approved by the results while the other was rejected. It is concluded that the rejected hypothesis was not in accordance with the claim since it overlooked some factors effecting positivism. The results of the survey support the claim by stating that ’engineering students are more positivist than social science students’.","authors":["Mustafa Suphi Erden"],"meta":["June 2003IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC Papers-OnLine) 36(10):117-122","DOI:10.1016/S1474-6670(17)33665-0"],"references":["269956239_The_Technological_Infrastructure_of_Science","251215660_Engineering_as_Captive_Discourse","242202534_Positivism_Structurationism_and_the_Differentiation-Polarisation_Theory_A_reconsideration_of_Shilling's_novelty_and_primacy_thesis","242166332_On_Structural_Differences_Between_Science_and_Engineering","23364593_The_data_of_psychoanalysis_and_the_social_sciences"]}
