{"id":"221651914_Exponent_Blinding_Does_Not_Always_Lift_Partial_Spa_Resistance_to_Higher-Level_Security","abstract":"Exponent blinding is known as a secure countermeasure against side-channel attacks. If single power traces reveal some exponent\nbits, an attack by Fouque et al. applies that recovers the exponent. However, this attack becomes infeasible if some of the\nguessed bits are incorrect. Thus, the attack was not assumed to be a realistic threat. In this paper we present two variants\nof a novel generic attack, which works for considerable error rates at each bit position, disproving the hypothesis that mere\nexponent blinding is always sufficient. We confirmed experimentally that our attack permits up to 28% (RSA case) or 23%\n(ECC case) error bits.","authors":["Werner Schindler","Kouichi Itoh"],"meta":["June 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-21554-4_5","SourceDBLP","Conference: Applied Cryptography and Network Security - 9th International Conference, ACNS 2011, Nerja, Spain, June 7-10, 2011.
