In the last years, the traditional perspective on software\ndevelopment is changing and agile methods have received considerable attention. Among other attributes,\nthe ageists claim that fostering creativity is one of the keys to response to common problems and challenges\nof software development today. The development of new software products requires the generation of novel\nand useful ideas. It is a conceptual framework introduced in the Agile Manifesto in 2001. This paper is\nwritten in support of agile practices in terms of significance of teamwork for the success of software\nprojects. Survey is used as a research method to know the significance of teamwork.","authors":["M.
