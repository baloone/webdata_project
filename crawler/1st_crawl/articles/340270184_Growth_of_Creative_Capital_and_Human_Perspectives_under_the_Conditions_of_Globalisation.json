{"id":"340270184_Growth_of_Creative_Capital_and_Human_Perspectives_under_the_Conditions_of_Globalisation","abstract":"Growth of creative capital and ever-burgeoning interest in the creativity phenomenon appear to have been facing intimidation with new threats emerging in connection with them – the unpredictability whereof is increasing under conditions of globalisation. The purpose of this study is to analyse the possible negative consequences of human creativity, globalisation and technological development. This perspective is developed using methods of comparative theoretical and methodological analysis, methods of theoretical reconstruction of basic strategies of the creative capital formation, modelling and extrapolation methods.\n\nThe issues of essence, nature, creativity and creative capital should be discussed in connection with solving social problems and studying of perspectives of human development. This is important because the human creation and creative activity can lead both to constructive and destructive processes, such as Human Development and Human disappearing from the history scene due to their own creativity.\n\nThe proposed perspective substantiates the necessity of deepened theoretical-philosophic analysis of creativity and growth of creative capital in connection with the emerging threats of the human development— discloses new aspects of the topic under discussion, which did not receive sufficient coverage in the scientific literature. Conclusions of the study possess a practical meaning for substantiating the development strategies in various fields of social practice and education in terms of globalisation.","authors":["Lyudmila M.
