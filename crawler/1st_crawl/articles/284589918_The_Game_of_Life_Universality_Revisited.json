{"id":"284589918_The_Game_of_Life_Universality_Revisited","abstract":"The Game of Life was created by J.H. Conway. One of the main features of this game is its universality. We prove in this paper this universality with respect to several computational models: boolean circuits, Turing machines, and two-dimensional cellular automata. These different points of view on Lifeâ€™s universality are chosen in order to clarify the situation and to simplify the original proof. We also present precise definitions of these 3 universality properties and explain the relations between them.","authors":["Bruno Durand","Zsuzsanna Roka"],"meta":["January 1999","DOI:10.1007/978-94-015-9153-9_2","In book: Cellular Automata (pp.51-74)"],"references":["220431575_Simple_Computation-Universal_Cellular_Spaces","315738873_Algorithms_Main_Ideas_and_Applications","275620232_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","265318386_Global_Properties_of_Cellular_Automata","246740320_Machine_Models_of_Self-Reproduction_in_Burks","244452702_Algorithms_Main_Ideas_and_Applications","244444514_The_converse_of_Moore's_Garden-of-Eden_theorem","243787070_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","239281915_An_introduction_to_the_general_theory_of_algorithms","238867355_Shorter_Note_The_Converse_of_Moore's_Garden-of-Eden_Theorem","238735942_Essays_on_Cellular_Automata","238166331_A_Simple_Universal_Cellular_Automaton_and_its_One-Way_and_Totalistic_Version","236853724_Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays","234812969_An_Introduction_to_the_General_Theory_of_Algorithms","229757267_Three-state_neumann_neighbor_cellular_automata_capable_of_constructing_self-reproducing_machines","225524505_Simulations_between_cellular_automata_on_Cayley_graphs","222803163_Tesselations_with_local_transformations","222609048_One-Way_Cellular_Automata_on_Cayley_Graphs","222437704_Universality_and_complexity_in_cellular_automata","221992012_Real-time_language_recognition_by_one-dimensional_cellular_automata","220544485_Endomorphisms_and_Automorphisms_of_the_Shift_Dynamical_Systems","37811203_The_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","35793648_Information_processing_and_transmission_in_cellular_automata","3046489_A_Universal_Four-State_Cellular_Computer"]}
