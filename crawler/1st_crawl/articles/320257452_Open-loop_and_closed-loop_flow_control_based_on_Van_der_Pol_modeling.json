{"id":"320257452_Open-loop_and_closed-loop_flow_control_based_on_Van_der_Pol_modeling","abstract":"A real-time modeling and control architecture for coupled shear layer von Kármán instabilities on a wing section wake is developed. Previous wind tunnel experiments highlighted that these wake instabilities give rise to limit cycles on both local and resulting airloads. The two-state Van der Pol system is employed to model the self-sustained oscillations exhibited by the actual flow. Schemes featuring either one or two coupled Van der Pol oscillators in parallel are taken under consideration. Open-loop and closed-loop control laws to manipulate and reduce the self-sustained oscillations are extensively studied. An adaptive control scheme is developed to optimize the performance of the controller, according to the flow conditions. For the open-loop control scheme, the consistency with experimental tests performed on a wind tunnel model is shown.","authors":["Valentina Motta","Leonie Malzacher"],"meta":["January 2018Acta Mechanica 229(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00707-017-1975-4"],"references":["318434492_Dynamics_of_a_hybrid_morphing_wing_with_active_open_loop_vibrating_trailing_edge_by_Time-Resolved_PIV_and_force_measures","305998667_Dimensionnement_d'une_maquette_pour_l'investigation_du_morphing_electroactif_hybride_en_soufflerie_subsonique","282122951_Numerical_simulation_of_a_discrete_time_model_for_the_Van_der_Pol_oscillator","272752612_Modeling_the_Aerodynamic_Lift_Produced_by_Oscillating_Airfoils_at_Low_Reynolds_Number","314821376_Final_solution_of_Duffing_equation_of_mixed_parity","314821110_Limit-cycle_oscillation_induced_by_nonlinear_aerodynamic_forces","303902274_Discrete_Time_Open-Loop_and_Closed-Loop_Flow_Control_Based_on_Van_der_Pol_Modeling","282307709_A_hybrid_morphing_NACA4412_airfoil_concept","273479529_Trailing-edge_dynamics_of_a_morphing_NACA0012_aileron_at_high_Reynolds_number_by_high-speed_PIV","270776038_Resonances_of_a_Forced_Mathieu_Equation_With_Reference_to_Wind_Turbine_Blades","241119349_Application_of_the_Forced_Stuart-Landau_Model_to_Cylinder_Wake_Oscillation","263414075_Vortex_shedding_modeling_using_diffusive_van_der_Pol_oscillators","260807256_Trailing-edge_dynamics_and_morphing_of_a_deformable_flat_plate_at_high_Reynolds_number_by_time-resolved_PIV","258475204_Residue_Harmonic_Balance_for_Two-Degree-of-Freedom_Airfoils_with_Cubic_Structural_Nonlinearity","245424628_Final_Solution_of_Duffing_Equation_of_Mixed_Parity"]}
