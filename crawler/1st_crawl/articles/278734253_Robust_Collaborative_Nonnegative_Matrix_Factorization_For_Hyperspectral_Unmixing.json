{"id":"278734253_Robust_Collaborative_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_For_Hyperspectral_Unmixing","abstract":"The recently introduced collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization\n(CoNMF) algorithm was conceived to simultaneously estimate the number of\nendmembers, the mixing matrix, and the fractional abundances from hyperspectral\nlinear mixtures. This paper introduces R-CoNMF, which is a robust version of\nCoNMF. The robustness has been added by a) including a volume regularizer which\npenalizes the distance to a mixing matrix inferred by a pure pixel algorithm;\nand by b) introducing a new proximal alternating optimization (PAO) algorithm\nfor which convergence to a critical point is guaranteed. Our experimental\nresults indicate that R-CoNMF provides effective estimates both when the number\nof endmembers are unknown and when they are known.","authors":["Jun Li","Jose M.
