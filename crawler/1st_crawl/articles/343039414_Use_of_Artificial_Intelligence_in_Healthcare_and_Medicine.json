{"id":"343039414_Use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Healthcare_and_Medicine","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science that mimic human cognitive functions. It has brought a paradigm shift in the medical field mostly due to the increase in healthcare data and rapid increase of analytical techniques [1]. In recent years AI has surpassed human performance in several medical field areas, and this is a great adoption in healthcare. Also, through the use of analytical techniques, AI has the capabilities to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat a wide range of diseases. This research paper will discuss different types of Artificial Intelligence techniques and how AI has been used in healthcare. Also, it will provide a view of the future of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare.","authors":["Deekshaa Khanna"],"meta":["September 2018","Project: My Study Project"],"references":["336794637_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_Healthcare_Sector","324986571_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Drug_Discovery_and_Development","261028220_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Psychological_Practice_Current_and_Future_Applications_and_Implications","258285203_A_survey_on_Data_Mining_approaches_for_Healthcare","341174556_Artificial_Intelligence_In_Software_Engineering","340343667_Cloud_Computing_Opportunities_And_Challenges","332297314_Intelligent_Healthcare_For_Future_Medicine","326881703_Cloud_computing-enabled_healthcare_opportunities_issues_and_applications_A_systematic_review","301276894_Survey_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_used_in_Healthcare_Domain","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview"]}
