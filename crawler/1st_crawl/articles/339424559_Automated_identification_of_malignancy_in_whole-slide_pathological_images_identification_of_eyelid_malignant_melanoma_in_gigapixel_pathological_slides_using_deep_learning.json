Using malignant probability from a convolutional neural network, the patches were embedded back into each WSI to generate a visualisation heatmap and leveraged a random forest model to establish a WSI-level diagnosis.\nMain outcome measure(s): For classification, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the efficacy of the DLS in detecting MM.\n\nResults\nFor patch diagnosis, the model achieved an AUC of 0.989 (95% CI 0.989 to 0.991), with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 94.9%, 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively. We displayed the lesion area on the WSIs as graded by malignant potential. For WSI, the obtained sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 96.5% and 98.2%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.998 (95% CI 0.994 to 1.000).\n\nConclusion\nOur DLS, which uses artificial intelligence, can automatically detect MM in histopathological slides and highlight the lesion area on WSIs using a probabilistic heatmap. In addition, our approach has the potential to be applied to the histopathological sections of other tumour types.","authors":["Linyan Wang","Longqian Ding","Zhifang Liu","Lingling Sun"],"meta":["March 2020The British journal of ophthalmology 104(3):318-323","DOI:10.1136/bjophthalmol-2018-313706"],"references":["327702205_Classification_and_mutation_prediction_from_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_histopathology_images_using_deep_learning","319570720_A_Methodology_for_Texture_Feature-based_Quality_Assessment_in_Nucleus_Segmentation_of_Histopathology_Image","317301118_Large_scale_tissue_histopathology_image_classification_segmentation_and_visualization_via_deep_convolutional_activation_features","317295514_Classification_of_breast_cancer_histology_images_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","316187429_Two-phase_deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_reducing_class_skewness_in_histopathological_images_based_breast_cancer_detection","304158394_Breast_Cancer_Histopathological_Image_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","304022458_The_Virtual_Microscope","321759252_Diagnostic_Assessment_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Lymph_Node_Metastases_in_Women_With_Breast_Cancer","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision"]}
