{"id":"220078851_List_Edge_and_List_Total_Colourings_of_Multigraphs","abstract":"This paper exploits the remarkable new method of Galvin (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 63 (1995), 153–158), who proved that the list edge chromatic number χ'_{list}(G) of a bipartite multigraph G equals its edge chromatic number χ'(G). It is now proved here that if every edge e = uw of a bipartite multigraph G is assigned a list of at least max{d(u),d(w)} colours, then G can be edge-coloured with each edge receiving a colour from its list. If every edge e = uw in an arbitrary multigraph G is assigned a list of at least max{d(u),d(w)} + ⌊½min{d(u),d(w)}⌋ colours, then the same holds; in particular, if G has maximum degree Δ = Δ(G) then χ'_{list}(G) ≤ ⌊3Δ/2⌋. Sufficient conditions are given in terms of the maximum degree and maximum average degree of G in order that χ'_{list}(G) = Δ and χ''_{list}(G) = Δ + 1. Consequences are deduced for planar graphs in terms of their maximum degree and girth, and it is also proved that if G is a simple planar graph and Δ ≥ 12 then χ'_{list}(G) = Δ and χ''_{list}(G) = Δ + 1.","authors":["O.
