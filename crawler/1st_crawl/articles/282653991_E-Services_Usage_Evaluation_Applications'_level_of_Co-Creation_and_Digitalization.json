{"id":"282653991_E-Services_Usage_Evaluation_Applications'_level_of_Co-Creation_and_Digitalization","abstract":"Nowadays, many traditional services have been moved or planning to move to the electronic environment. As a result of this movement enterprises need to realize the users' motivations regarding the electronic service applications. Electronic services have been classified on two dimensions, the degree of digitization and the ability for co-creation in 2*2 matrix. This paper aims to evaluate the usage of these four areas. In this regard, 38 services have been introduced under the eleven e-service applications, and then a questionnaire was distributed among 172 e-service users. The results show that services with the high level of digitalization and the low level of co-creation be mostly used.","authors":["Hamed Taherdoost","Shamsul Sahibuddin","Neda Jalaliyoon"],"meta":["January 2013Asian Academic Research Journal of Multidisciplinary 2(1):10-18","Project: E-service - E-commerce Technology"],"references":["291807724_E-service_A_new_paradigm_for_business_in_the_electronic_environment","257868825_The_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_Customer-Centric_Marketing","248186691_U-Commerce_Expanding_the_Universe_of_Marketing","247837002_Internet_Recommendation_Systems","240257685_Value_across_fulfillment-product_categories_of_Internet_shopping","292794386_The_Future_of_Competition_Co-Creating_Unique_Value_with_Customers","288794466_Opportunities_of_International_E-Services_A_Conceptual_Model","280797526_Why_interactive_computer_systems_are_sometimes_not_used_by_people_who_might_benefit_from_them","247745127_Understanding_Consumer_Choices_and_Preferences_in_Transaction-Based_e-Services","242330952_E-Services_-_A_Framework_for_Growth"]}
