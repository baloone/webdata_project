{"id":"321621297_Algebras_Rings_and_Modules","abstract":"As a natural continuation of the first volume of Algebras, Rings and Modules, this book provides both the classical aspects of the theory of groups and their representations as well as a general introduction to the modern theory of representations including the representations of quivers and finite partially ordered sets and their applications to finite dimensional algebras.\nDetailed attention is given to special classes of algebras and rings including Frobenius, quasi-Frobenius, right serial rings and tiled orders using the technique of quivers. The most important recent developments in the theory of these rings are examined.\nThe Cartan Determinant Conjecture and some properties of global dimensions of different classes of rings are also given. The last chapters of this volume provide the theory of semiprime Noetherian semiperfect and semidistributive rings.\nOf course, this book is mainly aimed at researchers in the theory of rings and algebras but graduate and postgraduate students, especially those using algebraic techniques, should also find this book of interest.","authors":["Michiel Hazewinkel","Nadiya Gubareni","V.V.
