{"id":"339988541_Derived_Hyperstructures_from_Hyperconics","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce generalized quadratic forms and hyperconics over quotient hyperfields as a generalization of the notion of conics on fields. Conic curves utilized in cryptosystems; in fact the public key cryptosystem is based on the digital signature schemes (DLP) in conic curve groups. We associate some hyperoperations to hyperconics and investigate their properties. At the end, a collection of canonical hypergroups connected to hyperconics is proposed.","authors":["Vahid Vahedi","Morteza Jafarpour","Šárka Hošková-Mayerová","H.
