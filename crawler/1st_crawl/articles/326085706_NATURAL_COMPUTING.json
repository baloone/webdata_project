{"id":"326085706_NATURAL_COMPUTING","abstract":"Natural computing refers to the field that investigates both human-designed computing inspired by nature and computing taking place in nature. It is based on the premise that “nature computes.” Due of its interdisciplinary nature, natural computing covers a spectrum of research areas including biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and engineering. This paper provides a brief introduction to natural computing.","authors":["Matthew N. O. Sadiku","Mahamadou Tembely","Sarhan M.
