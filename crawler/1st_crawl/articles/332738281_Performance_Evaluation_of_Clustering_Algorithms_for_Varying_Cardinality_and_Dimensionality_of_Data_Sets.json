{"id":"332738281_Performance_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Algorithms_for_Varying_Cardinality_and_Dimensionality_of_Data_Sets","abstract":"Clustering is the most widely used unsupervised machine learning technique, having extensive applications in statistical analysis. We have multiple clustering algorithms available in theory and many more implementations available in practice. A bunch of literatures can be found focusing on the quality of clustering algorithms using various internal and external evaluation techniques. The motivation behind this work is the scarcity of literatures dealing with performance of clustering algorithms in terms of turnaround time. This paper summarizes the experimental analysis conducted on the performance of multiple clustering algorithms based on cardinality and dimensionality. The analysis is performed in R, which is a free and open source programming language mainly used for statistical computing. This work evaluates nine key algorithms coming under partitioning, hierarchical, density-based and modelbased clustering approaches using different social media data sets. We captured performance trends of these algorithms in terms of turnaround time by varying the cardinality and dimensionality parameters of the data sets.","authors":["Shini Renjith","A.
