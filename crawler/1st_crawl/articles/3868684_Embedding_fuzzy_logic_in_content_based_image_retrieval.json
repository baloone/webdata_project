{"id":"3868684_Embedding_fuzzy_logic_in_content_based_image_retrieval","abstract":"This paper focuses on the possible embedding of the uncertainty\nregarding the colors of an image into histogram-type descriptors. The\nuncertainty naturally arises from both the quantization of the color\ncomponents and the human perception of colors. Fuzzy histograms measure\nthe typicality of each color within the image. We define various fuzzy\ncolor histograms following a taxonomy that classifies fuzzy techniques\nas crude fuzzy, fuzzy paradigm based, fuzzy aggregational and fuzzy\ninferential. For these fuzzy sets we must develop appropriate similarity\nmeasures and distances. We propose a class of such distances, derived\nfrom the fuzzy set equality and which we particularize according to\nvarious T-norms (fuzzy logical “or” operators). We also\nprove that the L1 metric naturally arises as a distance for fuzzy sets,\nconsidering the fuzzy set symmetric difference","authors":["Constantin Vertan","Nozha Boujemaa"],"meta":["February 2000","DOI:10.1109/NAFIPS.2000.877393","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Fuzzy Information Processing Society, 2000.
