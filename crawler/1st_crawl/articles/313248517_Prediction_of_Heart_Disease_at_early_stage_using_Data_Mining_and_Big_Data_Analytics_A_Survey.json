Data mining plays an important role in building an intelligent model for medical systems to detect heart disease using data sets of the patients, which involves risk factor associated with heart disease. Medical practitioners can help the patients by predicting the heart disease before occurring. The large data available from medical diagnosis is analysed by using data mining tools and useful information known as knowledge is extracted. Mining is a method of exploring large datasets to extract patterns which are hidden and previously unknown relationships and knowledge detection to help the better understanding of medical data to prevent heart disease. There are many data mining techniques available such as Classification techniques involving Na√Øve bayes, Decision tree, Neural network, Genetic algorithm, Artificial intelligence and Clustering algorithms like K-NN, and Support vector machine. Several studies have been carried out for developing prediction model using individual technique and also by combining two or more techniques. This paper provides a quick and easy review and understanding of available prediction models using data mining. The comparison shows the accuracy level of each model given by different researchers.","authors":["Salma Banu N K","Suma Swamy"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICEECCOT.2016.7955226","Conference: International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Communication, Computer and Optimization TechniquesAt: GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women, Mysuru"],"references":["289760362_Prediction_of_Heart_Disease_using_Classification_Algorithms","258651311_Improved_Study_of_Heart_Disease_Prediction_System_using_Data_Mining_Classification_Techniques","238733259_Intelligent_Heart_Disease_Prediction_System_using_CANFIS_and_Genetic_Algorithm","4329399_Intelligent_heart_disease_prediction_system_using_data_mining_techniques","2367740_Mining_Constrained_Association_Rules_to_Predict_Heart_Disease","289713227_Intelligent_and_effective_heart_attack_prediction_system_using_data_mining_and_artificial_neural_network","282963379_A_Survey_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_on_Risk_Prediction_Heart_Disease","282523649_Prediction_of_Heart_Diseases_in_Data_Mining_Techniques","271255740_Predict_the_Diagnosis_of_Heart_Disease_Patients_Using_Classification_Mining_Techniques","254028222_Using_data_mining_techniques_in_heart_disease_diagnosis_and_treatment","232631972_Combination_Data_Mining_Methods_with_New_Medical_Data_to_Predicting_Outcome_of_Coronary_Heart_Disease","222839477_A_multilayer_perceptron-based_medical_decision_support_system_for_heart_disease_diagnosis","220894396_Mining_Biosignal_Data_Coronary_Artery_Disease_Diagnosis_Using_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Features_of_HRV"]}
