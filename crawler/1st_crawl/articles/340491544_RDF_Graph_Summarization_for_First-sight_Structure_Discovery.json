{"id":"340491544_RDF_Graph_Summarization_for_First-sight_Structure_Discovery","abstract":"To help users get familiar with large RDF graphs, RDF summarization techniques can be used. In this work, we study quotient summaries of RDF graphs, that is: graph summaries derived from a notion of equivalence among RDF graph nodes. We make the following contributions: (i) four novel summaries which are often small and easy-to-comprehend, in the style of E–R diagrams; (ii) efficient (amortized linear-time) algorithms for computing these summaries either from scratch, or incrementally, reflecting additions to the graph; (iii) the first formal study of the interplay between RDF graph saturation in the presence of an RDFS ontology, and summarization; we provide a sufficient condition for a highly efficient shortcut method to build the quotient summary of a graph without saturating it; (iv) formal results establishing the shortcut conditions for some of our summaries and others from the literature; (v) experimental validations of our claim within a tool available online.","authors":["François Goasdoué","Pawel Guzewicz","Ioana Manolescu"],"meta":["September 2020The VLDB Journal 29(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00778-020-00611-y"],"references":["329116204_Summarizing_Semantic_Graphs_A_Survey","325032828_Quality_Metrics_For_RDF_Graph_Summarization","291823634_Diversified_Stress_Testing_of_RDF_Data_Management_Systems","326028431_Graph_Summarization_Methods_and_Applications_A_Survey","316267109_Large-Scale_bisimulation_of_RDF_graphs","313562144_Index_Structures_for_Path_Expressions","300579460_Constructing_Bisimulation_Summaries_on_a_Multi-Core_Graph_Processing_Framework","276139490_Set-based_approximate_approach_for_lossless_graph_summarization","273394626_Scalable_Keyword_Search_on_Large_RDF_Data","266660805_Using_Graph_Summarization_for_Join-Ahead_Pruning_in_a_Distributed_RDF_Engine","256133608_Large-Scale_Bisimulation_of_RDF_Graphs","254006607_Query_preserving_graph_compression","262410658_Efficiency_and_precision_trade-offs_in_graph_summary_algorithms","262399531_Efficient_Query_Answering_against_Dynamic_RDF_Databases","260324921_Managing_Structured_and_Semistructured_RDF_Data_Using_Structure_Indexes"]}
