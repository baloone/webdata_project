{"id":"234781951_Getting_More_Oomph_from_Programming_Exercises","abstract":"Much attention has been given to the content of introductory computer science courses, but based upon a perusal of introductory textbooks, it appears that somewhat less attention has been given to the programming exercises to be used in these courses. Programming exercises can be modified to provide a better educational experience for the student. An example of how atypical programming exercises were incorporated into an introductory programming language course is described.","authors":["Alan L.
