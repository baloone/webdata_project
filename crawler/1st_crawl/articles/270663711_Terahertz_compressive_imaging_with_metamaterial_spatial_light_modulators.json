{"id":"270663711_Terahertz_compressive_imaging_with_metamaterial_spatial_light_modulators","abstract":"Imaging at long wavelengths, for example at terahertz and millimetre-wave frequencies, is a highly sought-after goal of researchers because of the great potential for applications ranging from security screening and skin cancer detection to all-weather navigation and biodetection. Here, we design, fabricate and demonstrate active metamaterials that function as real-time tunable, spectrally sensitive spatial masks for terahertz imaging with only a single-pixel detector. A modulation technique permits imaging with negative mask values, which is typically difficult to achieve with intensity-based components. We demonstrate compressive techniques allowing the acquisition of high-frame-rate, high-fidelity images. Our system is all solid-state with no moving parts, yields improved signal-to-noise ratios over standard raster-scanning techniques, and uses a source orders of magnitude lower in power than conventional set-ups. The demonstrated imaging system establishes a new path for terahertz imaging that is distinct from existing focal-plane-array-based cameras.","authors":["Claire Watts","David Shrekenhamer","John Montoya","Guy Lipworth"],"meta":["August 2014Nature Photonics 8(8)","DOI:10.1038/nphoton.2014.139"],"references":["259534929_Four-Color_Metamaterial_Absorber_THz_Spatial_Light_Modulator","256605535_Passive_millimeter-wave_imaging_with_compressive_sensing","237056535_Terahertz_single_pixel_imaging_with_an_optically_controlled_dynamic_spatial_light_modulator","235415700_Terahertz_imaging_employing_graphene_modulator_array","234905671_A_spatial_light_modulator_for_terahertz_beams","225043909_Metamaterial_Electromagnetic_Wave_Absorbers","224406577_A_single-pixel_terahertz_imaging_system_based_on_compressed_sensing","301726096_MULTI-SLIT_MULTIPASS_SPECTROMETRY","278138674_Active_Terahertz_Metamaterial_Devices","228340993_Imaging_with_Terahertz_Radiation"]}
