{"id":"315798476_Killer_apps_Criteria_and_interdisciplinary_opportunities_for_developing_novel_team_applications","abstract":"As part of the Lorentz workshop, “Interdisciplinary Insights into Group and Team Dynamics,” held in Leiden, Netherlands, this article describes how Geeks and Groupies (computer and social scientists) may benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration towards the development of killer apps in team contexts that are meaningful and challenging for both. First, we discuss interaction processes during team meetings as a research topic for both Groupies and Geeks. Second, we highlight team work in healthcare settings as an interdisciplinary research challenge. Third, we discuss how an automated solution for optimal team design could benefit team effectiveness and feed into team-based interventions. Fourth, we discuss team collaboration in massive online open courses as a challenge for both Geeks and Groupies. We argue for the necessary integration of social and computational research insights and approaches. In the hope of inspiring future interdisciplinary collaborations, we develop criteria for evaluating killer apps – including the four proposed here – and discuss future research challenges and opportunities that potentially derive from these developments.","authors":["Claudia Buengeler","Florian Klonek","Nale Lehmann-Willenbrock","L-P Morency"],"meta":["October 2017Small Group Research","Project: Team Pulse App: A project to advance research translation within team settings"],"references":["309825433_Group_Affective_Tone_and_Team_Performance_A_Week-Level_Study_in_Project_Teams","305866845_Automatic_assessment_and_analysis_of_public_speaking_anxiety_A_virtual_audience_case_study","303801785_Convergence_of_intrapersonal_and_interpersonal_processes_across_group_meetings","294727858_Understanding_Positivity_Within_Dynamic_Team_Interactions_A_Statistical_Discourse_Analysis","291206149_Automatic_behavior_analysis_in_tag_games_from_traditional_spaces_to_interactive_playgrounds","309080735_MultiSense_-_Context-Aware_Nonverbal_Behavior_Analysis_Framework_A_Psychological_Distress_Use_Case","302593944_Systematic_Behavioral_Observation_for_Emergent_Team_Phenomena_Key_Considerations_for_Quantitative_Video-Based_Approaches","299983505_Noise_peaks_influence_communication_in_the_operating_room_An_observational_study","291186704_Adolescent_Suicidal_Risk_Assessment_in_Clinician-Patient_Interaction","286550775_Behavioral_Assessment_Practices_Among_Social_Psychologists_Who_Study_Small_Groups"]}
