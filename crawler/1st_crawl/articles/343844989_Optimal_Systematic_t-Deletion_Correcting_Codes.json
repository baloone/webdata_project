{"id":"343844989_Optimal_Systematic_t-Deletion_Correcting_Codes","abstract":"Systematic deletion correcting codes play an important role in applications of document exchange. Yet despite a series of recent advances made in deletion correcting codes, most of them are non-systematic. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the only known deterministic systematic t-deletion correcting code constructions with rate approaching 1 achieve O(t logÂ² n) bits of redundancy for constant t, where n is the code length. In this paper, we propose a systematic t-deletion correcting code construction that achieves 4t log n + o(log n) bits of redundancy, which is asymptotically within a factor of 4 from being optimal. Our encoding and decoding algorithms have complexity O(n^(2t+1)), which is polynomial for constant t.","authors":["Jin Sima","Ryan Gabrys","Jehoshua Bruck"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1109/ISIT44484.2020.9173986","Conference: 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)"],"references":["317190219_Guess_Check_Codes_for_Deletions_Insertions_and_Synchronization","260541993_A_Multiple_InsertionDeletion_Correcting_Code_for_Run-Length_Limited_Sequences","260541992_On_Helberg's_Generalization_of_the_Levenshtein_Code_for_Multiple_DeletionInsertion_Error_Correction","220779779_Communication_complexity_of_document_exchange","3080575_On_multiple_insertiondeletion_correcting_codes","343841929_Syndrome_Compression_for_Optimal_Redundancy_Codes","336935199_Two_Deletion_Correcting_Codes_From_Indicator_Vectors","328331658_Codes_Correcting_Two_Deletions","327093015_Codes_Correcting_Two_Deletions","324559027_Deterministic_Document_Exchange_Protocols_and_Almost_Optimal_Binary_Codes_for_Edit_Errors","324436082_Optimal_Document_Exchange_and_New_Codes_for_Small_Number_of_Insertions_and_Deletions","319390214_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","305322251_Edit_Distance_Sketching_Streaming_and_Document_Exchange","285458743_Efficient_Deterministic_Single_Round_Document_Exchange_for_Edit_Distance","262408262_Efficient_Communication_Protocols_for_Deciding_Edit_Distance","245681762_Codes_which_correct_single_asymet-ric_errors","221209296_A_Survey_of_Results_for_Deletion_Channels_and_Related_Synchronization_Channels","51986583_Binary_Codes_Capable_of_Correcting_Deletions_Insertions_and_Reversals","4165594_Improved_single-round_protocols_for_remote_file_synchronization"]}
