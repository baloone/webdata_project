{"id":"228362550_Sha-3_proposal_blake","abstract":"version 1.3, December 16, 2010 * This document is a revised version of the supporting documentation submitted to NIST on October 31, 2008. As such, it does not cite all relevant references published from that date. The hash functions specified are the \"tweaked\" versions, as submitted for the final of the SHA-3 competition. The original submitted functions were called BLAKE-28, BLAKE-32,BLAKE-48, and BLAKE-64; the tweaked versions are BLAKE-224, BLAKE-256, BLAKE-384, and BLAKE-512.","authors":["Jean-Philippe Aumasson","Luca Henzen","Willi Meier","Raphael C.-W.
