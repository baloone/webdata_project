{"id":"46396113_Importing_HOL_Light_into_Coq","abstract":"We present a new scheme to translate mathematical developments from HOL Light to Coq, where they can be re-used and re-checked. By relying on a carefully chosen embedding of Higher-Order Logic into Type Theory, we try to avoid some pitfalls of inter-operation between proof systems. In particular, our translation keeps the mathematical statements intelligible. This translation has been implemented and allows the importation of the HOL Light basic library into Coq.","authors":["Chantal Keller","Benjamin Werner"],"meta":["July 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-14052-5_22","Conference: Proceedings of the First international conference on Interactive Theorem Proving"],"references":["228452035_Simple_Types_in_Type_Theory_Deep_and_Shallow_Encodings","221302195_Simple_Types_in_Type_Theory_Deep_and_Shallow_Encodings","265246410_Recording_hol_Proofs","253719638_OpenTheory_Package_Management_for_Higher_Order_Logic_Theories","242502847_Theorem_Proving_in_Higher_Order_Logics_13th_International_Conference_TPHOLs_2000_Portland_Oregon_USA_August_14-18_2000_Proceedings","230625839_Introduction_to_HOL_A_Theorem_Proving_Environment_for_Higher_Order_Logic","221302499_Proof_Terms_for_Simply_Typed_Higher_Order_Logic","221057062_Type-safe_modular_hash-consing","220805736_Towards_Self-verification_of_HOL_Light","220805530_Importing_HOL_into_IsabelleHOL"]}
