{"id":"308981216_ZFC_proves_that_the_class_of_ordinals_is_not_weakly_compact_for_definable_classes","abstract":"In ZFC, the class Ord of ordinals is easily seen to satisfy the definable version of strong inaccessibility. Here we explore deeper ZFC-verifiable combinatorial properties of Ord, as indicated in Theorems A & B below. Note that Theorem A shows the unexpected result that Ord is never definably weakly compact in any model of ZFC.\nTheorem A. Let${\\cal M}$be any model of ZFC.\n(1) The definable tree property fails in${\\cal M}$: There is an${\\cal M}$-definable Ord -tree with no${\\cal M}$-definable cofinal branch.\n(2) The definable partition property fails in${\\cal M}$: There is an${\\cal M}$-definable 2-coloring$f:{[X]^2} \\to 2$for some${\\cal M}$-definable proper class X such that no${\\cal M}$-definable proper classs is monochromatic for f.\n(3) The definable compactness property for${{\\cal L}_{\\infty ,\\omega }}$fails in${\\cal M}$: There is a definable theory${\\rm{\\Gamma }}$in the logic${{\\cal L}_{\\infty ,\\omega }}$(in the sense of${\\cal M}$) of size Ord such that every set-sized subtheory of${\\rm{\\Gamma }}$is satisfiable in${\\cal M}$, but there is no${\\cal M}$-definable model of${\\rm{\\Gamma }}$.\n\nTheorem B. The definable ⋄ Ordprinciple holds in a model${\\cal M}$of ZFC iff${\\cal M}$carries an${\\cal M}$-definable global well-ordering.\nTheorems A and B above can be recast as theorem schemes in ZFC, or as asserting that a single statement in the language of class theory holds in all ‘spartan’ models of GB (Gödel-Bernays class theory); where a spartan model of GB is any structure of the form $\\left( {{\\cal M},{D_{\\cal M}}} \\right)$, where ${\\cal M} \\models {\\rm{ZF}}$ and ${D_{\\cal M}}$ is the family of ${\\cal M}$ -definable classes. Theorem C gauges the complexity of the collection GB spa of (Gödel-numbers of) sentences that hold in all spartan models of GB.\nTheorem C.
