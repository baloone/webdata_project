{"id":"320307330_Statistical_data_as_information_source_for_linguistic_analysis_of_russian_connectors","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to describe statistical data gathered from the supracorpora database (SCDB) of\nconnectors for further analysis of their formal and functional properties. Until now, these properties have usually been described applying semantic analysis, while corpus data, if used at all, have not been subject to statistical processing. It is automatically generated and verifiable information, collected fromtexts corpora that can be one of the most reliable tools in the analysis of linguistic units, including connectors. The paper shows what statistics one may obtain from the SCDB and how to use it in the linguistic analysis in case of tol’ko, a polyfunctional linguistic unit that can be a part of multicomponent and two-place connectors.","authors":["Olga Inkova","Nataliia Popkova"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.14357/19922264170314","Project: Структура многокомпонентных коннекторов русского языка и принципы ее представления в лингвистических базах данных"],"references":[]}
