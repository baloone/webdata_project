{"id":"339370344_Cryo-EM_structure_of_the_2019-nCoV_spike_in_the_prefusion_conformation","abstract":"The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development, we determined a 3.5 Ã…-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.","authors":["Daniel Wrapp","Nianshuang Wang","Kizzmekia S Corbett","Jory A.
