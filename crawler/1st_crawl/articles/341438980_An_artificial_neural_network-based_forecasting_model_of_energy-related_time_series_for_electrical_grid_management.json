{"id":"341438980_An_artificial_neural_network-based_forecasting_model_of_energy-related_time_series_for_electrical_grid_management","abstract":"Forecasting of energy-related variables is crucial for accurate planning and management of electrical power grids, aiming at improving overall efficiency and performance. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model is investigated for short-term forecasting of the hourly wind speed, solar radiation, and electrical power demand. Specifically, the non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) ANN is considered, compared to other models, and then selected to perform multi-step-ahead forecasting. Different time horizons have been considered in the range between 8 and 24 h ahead. The simulation analysis has put in evidence the main advantage of the proposed method, i.e., its capability to reconcile good forecasting performance in the short-term time horizon with a very simple network structure, which is potentially implementable on a low-cost processing platform.","authors":["Annalisa Di Piazza","Maria Carmela Di Piazza","Giuseppe La Tona","Massimiliano Luna"],"meta":["May 2020Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 184(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.matcom.2020.05.010"],"references":["273396628_A_Comparative_Study_of_Empirical_Mode_Decomposition-Based_Short-Term_Wind_Speed_Forecasting_Methods","272427590_An_Improved_Photovoltaic_Power_Forecasting_Model_With_the_Assistance_of_Aerosol_Index_Data","261160050_Wind_power_plant_prediction_by_using_neural_networks","260712732_Short-Term_Load_and_Wind_Power_Forecasting_Using_Neural_Network-Based_Prediction_Intervals","259511074_A_new_error_measure_for_forecasts_of_household-level_high_resolution_electrical_energy_consumption","258340564_A_Microgrid_Energy_Management_System_Based_on_the_Rolling_Horizon_Strategy","257026707_Multi-step-ahead_estimation_of_time_series_models","235760138_Conjugate-Gradient_Methods_for_Large-Scale_Minimization_in_Meteorology","228451636_Bringing_Wind_Energy_to_Market","224188805_A_review_of_wind_power_and_wind_speed_forecasting_methods_with_different_time_horizons","328484202_LASSO_LSTM_Integrated_Temporal_Model_for_Short-term_Solar_Intensity_Forecasting","326546314_A_hybrid_FCW-EMD_and_KF-BA-SVM_based_model_for_short-term_load_forecasting","326453567_A_deep_learning_model_for_short-term_power_load_and_probability_density_forecasting","323881899_The_National_Solar_Radiation_Data_Base_NSRDB","322488421_Energy_Load_Forecasting_using_Deep_Learning_Approach-LSTM_and_GRU_in_Spark_Cluster","316704161_Estimation_and_Forecast_of_Wind_Power_Generation_by_FTDNN_and_NARX-net_based_models_for_Energy_Management_Purpose_in_Smart_Grids","313860142_A_review_and_analysis_of_regression_and_machine_learning_models_on_commercial_building_electricity_load_forecasting","312101753_A_Two-Stage_Energy_Management_System_for_Smart_Buildings_Reducing_the_Impact_of_Demand_Uncertainty","274240434_Review_of_solar_irradiance_forecasting_methods_and_a_proposition_for_small-scale_insular_grids","263812508_Forecasting_household_consumer_electricity_load_profiles_with_a_combined_physical_and_behavioral_approach","262805886_A_hybrid_forecasting_model_with_parameter_optimization_for_short-term_load_forecasting_of_micro-grids","261716753_Improving_photovoltaics_grid_integration_through_short_time_forecasting_and_self-consumption","261319210_An_enhancement_of_agent-based_power_supply-demand_matching_by_using_ANN-based_forecaster","259127149_Solar_forecasting_methods_for_renewable_energy_integration","259119627_Global_Energy_Forecasting_Competition_2012","256080471_Assessment_of_forecasting_techniques_for_solar_power_production_with_no_exogenous_inputs","251627381_Environmental_data_processing_by_clustering_methods_for_energy_forecast_and_planning","239347525_Study_of_forecasting_solar_irradiance_using_neural_networks_with_preprocessing_sample_data_by_wavelet_analysis","232252053_Forecasting_of_preprocessed_daily_solar_radiation_time_series_using_neural_networks","224166221_Forecasting_power_output_for_grid-connected_photovoltaic_power_system_without_using_solar_radiation_measurement","5596072_Computational_capabilities_of_recurrent_NARX_neural_networks"]}
