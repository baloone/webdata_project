{"id":"220994413_Approximate_Shortest_Paths_Avoiding_a_Failed_Vertex_Optimal_Size_Data_Structures_for_Unweighted_Graph","abstract":"Let G=(V,E) be an undirected unweighted graph. A path between any two vertices u,v∈V is said to be t-approximate shortest path if its length is at most t times the length of the shortest path between u and v. We address the problem of building a compact data structure which can efficiently answer the following query for any u,v,x∈V and t>1:\nReport\nt-approximate shortest path between\nu\nand\nv\nwhen vertex\nx\nfails.\nWe present data structures for the single source as well as all-pairs versions of this problem. The query time guaranteed by our data structures is optimal up to a constant factor. Moreover, the size of each of them nearly matches the size of the corresponding data structure with no failures.","authors":["Neelesh Khanna","Surender Baswana"],"meta":["March 2010Algorithmica 66(1):513-524","DOI:10.1007/s00453-012-9621-y","SourceDBLP","Conference: 27th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, STACS 2010, March 4-6, 2010, Nancy, France"],"references":["242506069_Faster_Algorithms_for_All-pairs_Approximate_Shortest_Paths_in_Undirected_Graphs","239321680_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_in_Expected_On2_Time","313199853_A_Procedure_for_Computing_the_K_Best_Solutions_to_Discrete_Optimization_Problems_and_Its_Applications_to_the_Shortest_Path_Problem","284684743_Extremal_problems_in_graph_theory","267253388_Fortifying_OSPFIS-IS_against_link-failure","248779657_Fast_algorithms_for_finding_nearest_common_ancestor","244462146_Fibonacci_heaps_and_their_uses_in_improved_network_optimization_problems","238680472_Finding_K_Shortest_Loopless_Paths_in_a_Network","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","228057618_Fast_Estimation_of_Diameter_and_Shortest_Paths_without_Matrix_Multiplication"]}
