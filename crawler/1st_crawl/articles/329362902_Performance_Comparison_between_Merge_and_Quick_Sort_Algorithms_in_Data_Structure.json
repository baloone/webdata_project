{"id":"329362902_Performance_Comparison_between_Merge_and_Quick_Sort_Algorithms_in_Data_Structure","abstract":"In computer science field, one of the basic operation is sorting. Many sorting operations use intermediate steps. Sorting is the procedure of ordering list of elements in ascending or descending with the help of key value in specific order. Many sorting algorithms have been designed and are being used. This paper presents performance comparisons among the two sorting algorithms, one of them merge sort another one is quick sort and produces evaluation based on the performances relating to time and space complexity. Both algorithms are vital and are being focused for long period but the query is still, which of them to use and when. Therefore this research study carried out. Each algorithm resolves the problem of sorting of data with a unique method. This study offers a complete learning that how both of the algorithms perform operation and then distinguish them based on various constraints to come with outcome.","authors":["Irfan Ali","Haque Nawaz Lashari","Imran Khan Keerio","Abdullah Maitlo"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(11):192-195","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.091127"],"references":["319436458_Parallelization_of_Modified_Merge_Sort_Algorithm","306258293_A_Comparative_Study_of_Different_Types_of_comparison_Based_Sorting_Algorithms_in_Data_Structure","309181055_Comparison_of_different_sorting_algorithms_in_Data_Structure_based_upon_the_Time_Complexity","301912912_An_efficient_new_approach_mean_based_sorting","252030569_Experimental_study_on_the_five_sort_algorithms"]}
