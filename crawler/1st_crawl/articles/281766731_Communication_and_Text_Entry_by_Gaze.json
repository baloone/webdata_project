{"id":"281766731_Communication_and_Text_Entry_by_Gaze","abstract":"There are several ways to write by gaze. In a typical setup, gaze direction is used to point and dwell-select letters on an on-screen keyboard. Alternatively, if the person cannot fixate, the eyes can be used as switches using blinks or rough gestures to select items. This chapter introduces different ways to enter text by gaze and reviews related research. We will discuss techniques to enhance text entry by gaze, such as word and letter prediction, and show how the possibility of adjusting the duration of the dwell time affects learning and typing speed. In addition, design issues such as keyboard layout and feedback are raised, with practical examples and guidelines that may aid in designing interfaces for gaze-based text entry.","authors":["Päivi Majaranta"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.4018/978-1-61350-098-9.ch008","In book: Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies (pp.63-77)Chapter: 8Publisher: IGI GlobalEditors: Majaranta, P, Aoki, H, Donegan, M, Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A, and Räihä, K-J"],"references":["242287782_9_Text_Entry_by_Gaze_Utilizing_Eye-Tracking","228915903_Word_prediction_and_communication_rate_in_AAC","228915894_Language_technology_in_a_predictive_restricted_on-screen_keyboard_with_ambiguous_layout_for_severely_disabled_people","221568422_It's_in_Your_Eyes_Towards_Context-Awareness_and_Mobile_HCI_Using_Wearable_EOG_Goggles","221515650_Fast_gaze_typing_with_an_adjustable_dwell_time","221100181_Bringing_gaze-based_interaction_back_to_basics","221054662_Interacting_with_the_Computer_Using_Gaze_Gestures","220817409_The_Effects_of_Word_Prediction_on_Communication_Rate_for_AAC","220811102_Twenty_years_of_eye_typing_Systems_and_design_issues","220811032_Noise_Tolerant_Selection_by_Gaze-Controlled_Pan_and_Zoom_in_3D","220810986_Longitudinal_Evaluation_of_Discrete_Consecutive_Gaze_Gestures_for_Text_Entry","220810949_Now_Dasher_Dash_Away_Longitudinal_Study_of_Fast_Text_Entry_by_Eye_Gaze","220606553_Effects_of_feedback_and_dwell_time_on_eye_typing_speed_and_accuracy","200777614_Writing_with_Your_Eye_A_Dwell_Time_Free_Writing_System_Adapted_to_the_Nature_of_Human_Eye_Gaze","3113649_Human-computer_interaction_using_eye-gaze_input_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern","321391141_EYETRACKER_COMMUNICATION_SYSTEM","281574576_Symbol_systems_augmentative_communication_in_practice_An_introduction","279720155_Chapter_9_Text_Entry_by_Gaze","259256530_Text_entry_by_eye_gaze","246156109_Eye-Controlled_Computing_The_VisionKey_Experience","244446582_Use_of_an_eye-operated_computer_system_in_locked-in_syndrome","243451332_Management_of_Severe_Communication_Disorders_in_Children_and_Adults","232033675_Overview_of_Nonelectronic_Eye-Gaze_Communication_Techniques","228528185_Eye-S_a_Full-Screen_Input_Modality_for_Pure_Eye-based_Communication","226401905_Communication_via_eye_blinks_and_eyebrow_raises_Video-based_human-computer_interfaces","221519923_Inferring_Intent_in_Eye-Based_Interfaces_Tracing_Eye_Movements_with_Process_Models","221010348_Controlling_a_PC_by_eye_movements_The_MEMREC_project","220947118_Towards_an_Adaptive_Communication_Aid_with_Ambiguous_Text_Input","220876997_Dasher---a_data_entry_interface_using_continuous_gestures_and_language_models","220811095_Eye_Typing_Using_Word_and_Letter_Prediction_and_a_Fixation_Algorithm","11196526_Fast_Hands-free_Writing_by_Gaze_Direction","3331399_Modeling_the_Speed_of_Text_Entry_with_a_Word_Prediction_Interface","3113881_Eye-gaze_word_processing","2479563_Towards_an_Adaptive_Communication_Aid_with_Text_Input_from_Ambiguous_Keyboards","2244456_Text_Input_Methods_for_Eye_Trackers_Using_Off-Screen_Targets"]}
