{"id":"341135610_Where_is_the_teacher_Digital_analytics_for_classroom_proxemics","abstract":"Lay Description\n\nWhat is already known about this topic\nThe term “Classroom Proxemics” refers to how teachers and students use the classroom space, and its impact on learning.\nA large number of teachers, particularly in higher education, receive no pedagogical training or feedback on classroom proxemics.\nLittle is known about how to create interfaces to enhance teachers' awareness, using automatic position tracking.\n\nWhat this paper adds\nIndoor positioning data from four teachers in a physics classroom are analysed.\nTeachers' reflections on visual representations of teachers' positioning are documented.\nAnalytics of teachers' proxemics are identified from teachers' reflections.\nEmerging themes included classroom territoriality, classroom space use according to the learning design, differences between teaching behaviours and temporality.\n\nImplications for practitioners\nThe learning design and differences among teachers play a critical role in making sense of teachers' positioning data.\nAnalytics of classroom proxemics can create new opportunities to support professional development.\nThe use of positioning sensors in the classroom can provide evidence for teachers to reflect on improvement and how they approach students over time.","authors":["Roberto Martinez-Maldonado","Jurgen Schulte","Vanessa Echeverria","Yuveena Gopalan"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Computer Assisted Learning 36(5)","DOI:10.1111/jcal.12444"],"references":["331373770_Towards_Collaboration_Translucence_Giving_Meaning_to_Multimodal_Group_Data","331333251_I_Spent_More_Time_with_that_Team_Making_Spatial_Pedagogy_Visible_Using_Positioning_Sensors","352822232_Instructional_Proxemics_and_Its_Impact_on_Classroom_Teaching_and_Learning","347088839_On_the_Move_Using_TeacherStudent_Proximity_to_Improve_Students'_Behavior","344941947_Dandelion_Diagram_Aggregating_Positioning_and_Orientation_Data_in_the_Visualization_of_Classroom_Proxemics","340018050_Teacher_Tracking_with_Integrity_What_Indoor_Positioning_Can_Reveal_About_Instructional_Proxemics","339917287_Learning-centred_translucence_an_approach_to_understand_how_teachers_talk_about_classroom_data","338686676_Designing_translucent_learning_analytics_with_teachers_an_elicitation_process","331340554_Technologies_for_automated_analysis_of_co-located_real-life_physical_learning_spaces_Where_are_we_now","330478176_Using_Data_Mining_and_Machine_Learning_Approaches_to_Observe_Technology-Enhanced_Learning","325861425_Where_Is_the_Nurse_Towards_Automatically_Visualising_Meaningful_Team_Movement_in_Healthcare_Education","324947796_Transforming_Training_in_Orientation_and_Mobility_Examining_the_Effect_Using_an_Audio-Link_on_the_Distance_Between_Trainer_and_Trainee","324482186_Peer_observation_of_teaching_A_practical_tool_in_higher_education","325849056_Quantifying_Classroom_Instructor_Dynamics_with_Computer_Vision","323861701_Analysis_of_interactions_between_lecturers_and_students"]}
