{"id":"291520756_Accuracy_of_Digital_Impressions_and_Fitness_of_Single_Crowns_Based_on_Digital_Impressions","abstract":"In this study, the accuracy (precision and trueness) of digital impressions and the fitness of single crowns manufactured based on digital impressions were evaluated. #14-17 epoxy resin dentitions were made, while full-crown preparations of extracted natural teeth were embedded at #16. (1) To assess precision, deviations among repeated scan models made by intraoral scanner TRIOS and MHT and model scanner D700 and inEos were calculated through best-fit algorithm and three-dimensional (3D) comparison. Root mean square (RMS) and color-coded difference images were offered. (2) To assess trueness, micro computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to get the reference model (REF). Deviations between REF and repeated scan models (from (1)) were calculated. (3) To assess fitness, single crowns were manufactured based on TRIOS, MHT, D700 and inEos scan models. The adhesive gaps were evaluated under stereomicroscope after cross-sectioned. Digital impressions showed lower precision and better trueness. Except for MHT, the means of RMS for precision were lower than 10 m. Digital impressions showed better internal fitness. Fitness of single crowns based on digital impressions was up to clinical standard. Digital impressions could be an alternative method for single crowns manufacturing.","authors":["Xin Yang","Pin Lv","Yihong Liu","Wenjie si"],"meta":["July 2015Materials 8(7):3945-3957","DOI:10.3390/ma8073945"],"references":["279603584_Accuracy_testing_of_a_new_intraoral_3D_camera","270343386_Effect_of_anatomic_semi-anatomic_and_non-anatomic_occlusal_surface_tooth_preparations_on_the_adaptation_of_zirconia_copings","259987625_Comparison_of_digital_and_conventional_impression_techniques_Evaluation_of_patients'_perception_treatment_comfort_effectiveness_and_clinical_outcomes","269727181_Surface_Detail_Reproduction_and_Effect_of_Disinfectant_and_Long-Term_Storage_on_the_Dimensional_Stability_of_a_Novel_Vinyl_Polyether_Silicone_Impression_Material","264827711_Scanning_accuracy_and_precision_in_4_intraoral_scanners_An_in_vitro_comparison_based_on_3-dimensional_analysis","260110373_Impact_of_digital_impression_techniques_on_the_adaption_of_ceramic_partial_crowns_in_vitro","257203956_Assessment_of_the_accuracy_and_reliability_of_new_3-dimensional_scanning_devices","256329459_Precision_of_intraoral_digital_dental_impressions_with_iTero_and_extraoral_digitization_with_the_iTero_and_a_model_scanner","251567799_Accuracy_of_a_Digital_Impression_System_Based_on_Active_Wavefront_Sampling_Technology_for_Implants_Considering_Operator_Experience_Implant_Angulation_and_Depth","236074170_An_in_vitro_study_on_the_dimensional_stability_of_a_vinyl_polyether_silicone_impression_material_over_a_prolonged_storage_period"]}
