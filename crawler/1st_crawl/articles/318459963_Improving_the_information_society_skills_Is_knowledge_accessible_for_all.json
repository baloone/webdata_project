{"id":"318459963_Improving_the_information_society_skills_Is_knowledge_accessible_for_all","abstract":"The emergence and popularization of information and communications technologies (ICT) is changing modern society and its educational landscape. ICT facilitates individuals’ ability to learn anywhere and at any time. In fact, by using ICT, access to knowledge acquisition is not restricted to formal contexts, such as academic institutions. This position paper reviews the educational contexts in which new learning strategies using ICT have been adapted, by focusing on how users access information and improve their digital skills. Our initial hypothesis is that in technological environments, learners use very specific devices and applications to access information, because content accessibility depends on both the user’s profiles and ICT. We demonstrate this through a case study applied in several Spanish university institutions.","authors":["David Fonseca","Miguel Conde-González","Francisco José García-Peñalvo"],"meta":["June 2018Universal Access in the Information Society 17(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10209-017-0548-6"],"references":["345729199_Predicting_Dropout_Student_An_Application_of_Data_Mining_Methods_in_an_Online_Education_Program","330303977_Models_of_Technology_and_Change_in_Higher_Education_An_international_comparative_survey_on_the_current_and_future_use_of_ICT_in_Higher_Education","318236847_A_Metamodel_Proposal_for_Developing_Learning_Ecosystems","316631227_Open_Source_Solutions_for_Knowledge_Management_and_Technological_Ecosystems","353138221_Creacion_de_un_blog_educativo_como_herramienta_TIC_e_instrumento_TAC_en_el_ambito_universitario","329649885_Technology_and_Social_Inclusion_Rethinking_the_Digital_Divide","318417505_Usability_and_satisfaction_assessment_of_vocational_training_students_in_terms_of_their_initial_motivation_Mobile_comerce_course_using_SCC_methodology","316646609_Enhancing_Education_for_the_Knowledge_Society_Era_with_Learning_Ecosystems","316473147_Technological_adaptation_of_the_student_to_the_educational_density_of_the_course_A_case_study_3D_architectural_visualization","313181759_First_steps_in_the_integration_of_institutional_and_personal_learning_environments","311443060_Strategy_as_ecology","309005658_MLearning_and_pre-service_teachers_An_assessment_of_the_behavioral_intention_using_an_expanded_TAM_model","305190127_Science-Trained_Professionals_for_the_Innovation_Ecosystem_Looking_Back_and_Looking_Ahead","304189415_Learning4Work_Designing_a_New_Evaluation_System_Based_on_Scenario_Centered_Curriculum_Methodology_The_Pre-test","304188654_ICT_for_Older_People_to_Learn_about_ICT_Application_and_Evaluation"]}
