{"id":"316872644_Acoustic_emission_and_electrical_resistance_in_SiC-based_laminate_ceramic_composites_tested_under_tensile_loading","abstract":"Acoustic emission and electrical resistance were monitored for SiC-based laminate composites while loaded in tension and correlated with damage sources. The ceramic matrix composites were composed of Hi-Nicalon Type Sâ„¢ fibers, a boron-nitride interphase, and pre-impregnated (pre-preg) melt-infiltrated silicon/SiC matrix. Tensile load-unload-reload or tensile monotonic tests were performed to failure or to a predetermined strain condition. Some of the specimens were annealed which relieved some residual matrix compressive stress and enabled higher strains to failure. Differences in location, acoustic frequency and energy, and quantity of matrix cracking have been quantified for unidirectional and cross-ply type architectures. Consistent relationships were found for strain and matrix crack density with acoustic emission activity and the change in measured electrical resistance measured at either the peak stress or after unloading to a zero-stress state. Fiber breakage in the vicinity of composite failure was associated with high frequency, low energy acoustic events.","authors":["Greg Morscher","Neal A.
