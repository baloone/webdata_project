{"id":"328896297_A_Sequential_Bayesian_Approach_for_Remaining_Useful_Life_Prediction_of_Dependent_Competing_Failure_Processes","abstract":"A sequential Bayesian approach is presented for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of dependent competing failure processes (DCFP). The DCFP considered comprises of soft failure processes due to degradation and hard failure processes due to random shocks, where dependency arises due to the abrupt changes to the degradation processes brought by the random shocks. In practice, random shock processes are often unobservable, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the shock intensities and predict the RUL. In the proposed method, the problem is solved recursively in a two-stage framework: in the first stage, parameters related to the degradation processes are updated using particle filtering, based on the degradation data observed through condition monitoring; in the second stage, the intensities of the random shock processes are updated using the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm, considering the dependency between the degradation and shock processes, and the fact that no hard failure has occurred. The updated parameters are, then, used to predict the RUL of the system. Two numerical examples are considered for demonstration purposes and a real dataset from milling machines is used for application purposes. Results show that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the RUL in DCFP conditions.","authors":["Mengfei Fan","Zhiguo Zeng","Enrico Zio","Rui Kang"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Transactions on Reliability PP(99):1-13","DOI:10.1109/TR.2018.2874459","Project: Dependent failure process: modeling and analysis"],"references":["317394013_A_compositional_method_to_model_dependent_failure_behavior_based_on_PoF_models","315473863_RUL_Prediction_of_Deteriorating_Products_Using_An_Adaptive_Wiener_Process_Model","313920048_A_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems_based_framework_for_modeling_dependent_failure_processes","311394435_System_dynamic_reliability_assessment_and_failure_prognostics","322073834_Reliability_and_maintenance_policies_for_a_two-stage_shock_model_with_self-healing_mechanism","317595536_A_Stochastic_Analysis_of_Competing_Failures_with_Propagation_Effects_in_Functional_Dependence_Gates","317336655_Lifetime_Prognostics_for_Furnace_Wall_Degradation_with_Time-Varying_Random_Jumps","316971698_Remaining_useful_life_prediction_for_non-stationary_degradation_processes_with_shocks","316750107_Modeling_dependent_competing_failure_processes_with_degradation-shock_dependence","309447965_Reliability_Assessment_of_Competing_Risks_with_Generalized_Mixed_Shock_Models"]}
