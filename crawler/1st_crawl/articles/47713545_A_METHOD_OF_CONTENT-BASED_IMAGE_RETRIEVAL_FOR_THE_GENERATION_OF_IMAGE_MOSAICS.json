{"id":"47713545_A_METHOD_OF_CONTENT-BASED_IMAGE_RETRIEVAL_FOR_THE_GENERATION_OF_IMAGE_MOSAICS","abstract":"An image mosaic is an artistic work that uses a number of smaller images creatively combined together to form another larger image. Each building block image, or tessera, has its own distinctive and meaningful content, but when viewed from a distance the tesserae come together to form an aesthetically pleasing montage. This work presents the design and implementation of MosaiX, a computer software system that generates these image mosaics automatically. To control the image mosaic creation process, several parameters are used within the system. Each parameter affects the overall mosaic quality, as well as required processing time, in its own unique way. A detailed analysis is performed to evaluate each parameter individually. Additionally, this work proposes two novel ways by which to evaluate the quality of an image mosaic in a quantitative way. One method focuses on the perceptual color accuracy of the mosaic reproduction, while the other concentrates on edge replication. Both measures include preprocessing to take into account the unique visual features present in an image mosaic. Doing so minimizes quality penalization due the inherent properties of an image mosaic that make them visually appealing.","authors":["Michael Snead"],"meta":[],"references":["220720466_Jigsaw_Image_Mosaics","2954453_Query_by_image_and_video_content_The_QBIC_System","2595206_Similarity_of_Color_Images","317218810_Color_image_retrieval_based_on_primitives_of_color_moments","234527598_Rapid_Texture_Identification","228083862_Digital_Image_Processing","224725165_Color_texture_moments_for_content-based_image_retrieval","221304476_Finding_Naked_People","220979542_Color_Indexing_with_Weak_Spatial_Constraints","220049369_A_K-means_Clustering_Algorithm_Algorithm_AS_136","7404866_Texture_Image_Retrieval_Using_New_Rotated_Complex_Wavelet_Filters","4045217_Colour_spaces_Perceptual_historical_and_applicational_background","4036609_An_adaptive_texture_image_retrieval_system_using_wavelets","3996281_On_the_use_of_hierarchical_color_moments_for_image_indexing_and_retrieval","3703115_Image_indexing_using_color_correlograms","3592438_Visual_image_retrieval_by_elastic_deformation_of_object_sketches","3193597_Wang_ZJ_Automatic_linguistic_indexing_of_pictures_by_a_statistical_modeling_approach_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_25_1075-1088","2861199_Color_Texture_Moments_For_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","2391748_Combining_Supervised_Learning_with_Color_Correlograms_for_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval"]}
