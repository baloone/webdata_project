{"id":"323392573_Generalized_entropies_in_quantum_and_classical_statistical_theories","abstract":"We study a version of the generalized (h, {\\phi})-entropies, introduced by Salicr\\'u et al, for a wide family of probabilistic models that includes quantum and classical statistical theories as particular cases. We extend previous works by exploring how to define (h, {\\phi})-entropies in infinite dimensional models.","authors":["Mariela Portesi","Federico Holik","P. W.
