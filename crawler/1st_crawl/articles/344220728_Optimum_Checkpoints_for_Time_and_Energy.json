{"id":"344220728_Optimum_Checkpoints_for_Time_and_Energy","abstract":"We consider programs running on systems where failures can occur, and in which checkpoints are used to assure the reliability of the programs' execution. We consider the energy consumption for the program's execution, in addition to its run time, as criteria that need to be used to minimize the overall cost due to checkpoints. New expressions for both the program's run-time and the corresponding energy consumption that include the failure probability per instruction execution, and the overhead incurred for each checkpoint, are derived. For programs which run indefinitely in an infinite loop, such as certain real-time applications, a first principle based analysis yields the checkpoint interval that minimizes a linear combination of the average execution time of the program and of its average energy consumption via the classical \"Lambert W(.) function\". For looping programs which run for a finite time, the optimum checkpoint interval is obtained using a different approach. The results are illustrated with numerical examples.","authors":["Erol Gelenbe","Miltiadis Siavvas","Paweł Boryszko","Joanna Domańska"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.1109/MASCOTS50786.2020.9285959","Conference: to appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Models, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems, Mascots 2020.At: Nice, France","Project: SerIoT - Secure and Safe Internet of Things"],"references":["342543785_Neural_network_architectures_for_the_detection_of_SYN_flood_attacks_in_IoT_systems","326709023_Deep_Learning_with_Dense_Random_Neural_Network_for_Detecting_Attacks_against_IoT-connected_Home_Environments","324828912_Static_analysis-based_approaches_for_Secure_Software_Development","336258977_Optimum_Interval_for_Application-level_Checkpoints","334259316_Optimum_Checkpoints_for_Programs_with_Loops","333242050_Checkpoint_and_Restart_An_Energy_Consumption_Characterization_in_Clusters","331146019_An_energy-efficient_QoS-aware_and_cost-effective_scheduling_approach_for_real-time_workflow_applications_in_cloud_computing_systems_utilizing_DVFS_and_approximate_computations","327851330_The_Impact_of_Workload_Variability_on_the_Energy_Efficiency_of_Large-Scale_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","324867446_Efficient_modeling_and_optimizing_of_checkpointing_in_concurrent_component-based_software_systems","324020730_Optimizing_checkpoint_intervals_for_reduced_energy_use_in_exascale_systems"]}
