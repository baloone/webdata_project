{"id":"220329686_Adding_Time_to_Synchronous_Process_Communications","abstract":"In distributed real-time systems, communicating processes cannot be delayed for arbitrary amounts of time while waiting for messages. Thus, communication primitives used for real-time programming usually allow the inclusion of a deadline or timeout to limit potential delays due to synchronization. This paper interprets timed synchronous communication as having absolute deadlines. Various ways of implementing deadlines are discussed, and two useful timed synchronous communication problems are identified which differ in the number of of participating senders and receivers and type of synchronous communication. For each problem, a simple algorithm is presented and shown to be correct. The algorithms are shown to guarantee maximal success and to require the smallest delay intervals during which processes wait for synchronous communication. We also evaluate the number of messages used to reach agreement.","authors":["Insup Lee","Susan Davidson"],"meta":["August 1987IEEE Transactions on Computers 36(8):941-948","DOI:10.1109/TC.1987.5009517","SourceDBLP"],"references":["260585604_Timing_Issues_in_the_Distributed_Execution_of_Ada_Programs","221655800_Communication_Support_for_Reliable_Distributed_Computing","220404718_Using_Time_Instead_of_Timeout_for_Fault-Tolerant_Distributed_Systems","245805381_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","238718849_Crash_recovery_in_a_distributed_database_system","221344323_Fault-Tolerant_Clock_Synchronization","221343949_Byzantine_Clock_Synchronization","220565970_Concepts_and_Notations_for_Concurrent_Programming","220404278_Real-Time_Synchronization_of_Interprocess_Communications","220225325_Applications_of_Byzantine_Agreement_in_Database_Systems","213876567_Time_Clocks_and_the_Ordering_of_Events_in_a_Distributed_System","200030043_Concepts_and_Notations_for_Concurrent_Programming","34678531_Abstraction_mechanisms_and_language_design","32206662_Language_Constructs_for_Distributed_Real-Time_Programming","3189619_A_Formal_Model_of_Crash_Recovery_in_a_Distributed_System","2243990_The_Consensus_Problem_in_Unreliable_Distributed_Systems_A_Brief_Survey"]}
