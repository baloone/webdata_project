{"id":"341275294_Development_and_Application_of_a_Networked_Automatic_Deformation_Monitoring_System","abstract":"Automatic deformation monitoring systems based on different types of sensors have been extensively studied in recent years. However, the existing systems cannot be applied to deformation monitoring projects in which monitoring points are distributed discretely and navigation satellite signals are occluded severely. Therefore, this study proposes a networked automatic deformation monitoring system (NADMS) to solve these problems. The NADMS uses different types of robotic total stations (RTSs) as sensors. The proposed system uses wireless networks and a MySQL database to realize the remote control of multiple RTSs and remote transmission and network query of observational data. Furthermore, the system realizes the station-moving-without-learning (SMWL) function using a free-station method. That is, if an RTS moves after the first learning cycle, re-orientation and the previous monitoring work can be continued without learning again. The RTS can correct its coordinates and azimuth automatically, and different types of RTSs can collect and transmit observational data collaboratively and independently in the NADMS. The precision and practicability of the NADMS are analyzed by simulation tests and a field test, and the results show that the system is effective and feasible and can meet the required monitoring precision of millimeter level.","authors":["Wei Fan","Guorong Pan","Lei Wang"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Geovisualization and Spatial Analysis 4(1)","DOI:10.1007/s41651-020-00051-w"],"references":["282515060_Detection_of_high_speed_railway_track_static_regularity_with_laser_trackers","272255955_Development_and_application_of_deformation_monitoring_system_for_lanslide_at_Funchunjiang_Dam","348894397_The_Design_and_Application_of_Deformation_Automatic_Monitoring_System_for_Metro_Tunnel_Crossing_Project","311260723_Development_and_application_of_several_georobots_in_automatic_monitoring","305159512_Real-time_deformation_monitoring_data_processing_based_on_BDS_triple-frequency_observations","298076089_Research_and_Realization_of_Deformation_Monitoring_Algorithm_with_Millimeter_Level_Precision_Based_on_BeiDou_Navigation_Satellite_System","294101657_The_experimental_study_of_buildings_deformation_monitoring_method_based_on_3D_laser_scanning","286979295_Change_detection_of_buildings_based_on_terrestrial_laser_scanning_data","272639673_The_Application_of_Digital_Photography_Techniques_in_Structure_Deformation_Measurement","272310115_Precise_determination_of_mini_railway_track_with_ground_based_laser_scanning","256968075_Fiber_Bragg_grating_sensors_for_structural_health_monitoring_of_Tsing_Ma_bridge_Background_and_experimental_observation"]}
