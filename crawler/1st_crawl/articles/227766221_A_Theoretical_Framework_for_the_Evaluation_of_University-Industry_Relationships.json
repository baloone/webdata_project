{"id":"227766221_A_Theoretical_Framework_for_the_Evaluation_of_University-Industry_Relationships","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to build up a theoretical framework to study university-industry interorganisational relations (U-1 IOR) and formulate hypotheses which will be tested on empirical data in a future research phase. Then, a taxonomy for university-industy relationships is proposed. Finally, the problem of evaluating relationships between universities and industries by defining the concept of ‘relationship performance’ is addressed.","authors":["Andrea Bonaccorsi","Andrea Piccaluga"],"meta":["July 1994R& D Management 24(3):229 - 247","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9310.1994.tb00876.x"],"references":["249721975_Assessing_Basic_Research_The_Case_of_the_Isaac_Newton_Telescope","245024252_Boundary_Spanning_Roles_and_Organization_Structure","239060865_Alliances_in_Industrial_Purchasing_The_Determinants_of_Joint_Action_in_Buyer-Supplier_Relationships","238681029_Determinants_of_Coordination_Modes_Within_Organizations","229710328_Scientific_Research_Evaluation_A_Review_of_Methods_and_Various_Contexts_of_Their_Application","228316231_The_RD_Boundaries_of_the_Firm_An_Empirical_Analysis","227445746_Organizational_Information_Requirements_Media_Richness_and_Structural_Design","220019726_Absorptive_Capacity_A_New_Perspective_on_Learning_and_Innovation","346674597_The_economic_theory_of_technology_policy_an_introduction","328711515_Interorganizational_Exchange_Behavior_in_Marketing_Channels_A_Broadened_Perspective","321605237_Cooperative_Research_and_Development_The_Industry-University-Government_Relationship","314007192_Strategy_for_RD_Studies_in_the_Microeconomics_of_Development","312294528_An_Evolutionary_Theory_of_Economic_Change","304920449_Profiting_from_technological_innovation_Implications_for_integration_collaboration_licensing_and_public_policy","303589917_Diversification_versus_specialization_Generic_and_localized_knowledge","301976066_New_Issues_in_Science_and_Technology_Policy_Discontinuities_in_the_Process_of_Knowledge_Generation_Knowledge_Transfer_and_Knowledge_Transformation","299670604_The_Role_of_Project_Histories_in_the_Study_of_RD","296148518_CRITICAL_ASPECTS_OF_INDUSTRIAL_AND_ACADEMIC_COLLABORATION","284863958_University-Industry_Relations_A_Review_of_Major_Issues","284383331_The_RD_function_Corporate_strategy_and_structure","273356996_Social_and_Private_Rates_of_Return_from_Industrial_Innovation","272937299_Technological_Paradigms_and_Technological_Trajectories","269888475_On_the_Nature_Formation_and_Maintenance_of_Relations_Among_Organizations","256417596_RD_cooperation_between_industry_universities_and_research_organizations_in_Europe","256353009_Technology_transfer_from_universities_and_research_laboratories","256176382_Similarities_and_differences_between_scientific_and_technological_paradigms","249622084_What_Is_Private_and_What_Is_Public_About_Technology","248497190_Universityindustry_research_linkages_and_knowledge_transfers_A_general_equilibrium_approach","246390005_How_exogenous_is_science_In_Inside_the_Black_Box_Technology_and_Economics","245584852_NBER_The_Rate_and_Direction_of_Inventive_Activity","245219123_Key_variables_in_technology_transfer_A_field-study_based_empirical_analysis","244451011_A_Tentative_Exploration_Into_the_Amount_and_Equivocality_of_Information_Processing_in_Organizational_Work_Units","243448166_Information_Flow_in_Research_and_Development_Laboratories","242557609_Managing_The_Flow_Of_Technology","242403767_Determinants_of_Interorganizational_Relationships_Integration_and_Future_Directions","239667388_Technological_Change_and_the_Nature_of_the_Firm","239063016_An_Overview_of_Innovation","238247117_Information_richness_a_new_apporach_to_managerial_information_processing_and_organizational_design","235362235_Interorganizational_Exchange_Behavior_in_Marketing_Channels_A_Broadened_Perspective","233228030_Evolution_complex_systems_and_technological_change_1","232980916_High_Technology_and_Local_Economic_Development","227960766_Scientific_and_Technical_Information_Transfer_for_High_Technology","227388853_Inside_the_Black_Box","223089301_What_Makes_Basic_Research_Economically_Useful","222512052_The_roles_of_science_in_technological_innovation","222465572_Technological_Paradigms_and_Technological_Trajectories_A_Suggested_Interpretation_of_the_Determinants_and_Directions_of_Technical_Change","222458097_Manufacture-Supplier_Relationships_in_Japan_and_the_Concept_of_Relation-Specific_Skill","222446198_Profiting_from_Technological_Innovation_Implications_for_Integration_Collaboration_Licensing_and_Public_Policy","202357760_An_Evolution_Theory_of_Economic_Change","38009478_Technological_Communities_and_the_Diffusion_of_Knowledge","37415951_The_Informational_City_Information_Technology_Economic_Restructuring_and_The_Urban-Regional_Process","33859400_Technological_Development_in_Industrial_Networks","24106362_The_Simple_Economics_of_Basic_Economic_Research","24057874_RD_Dynamics_in_the_Product_Life_Cycle","24007897_Industry-university_technology_transfer_in_microelectronics"]}
