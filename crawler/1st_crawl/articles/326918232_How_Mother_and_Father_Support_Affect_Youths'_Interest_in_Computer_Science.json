{"id":"326918232_How_Mother_and_Father_Support_Affect_Youths'_Interest_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"Parental support is a predictor of children's career interest and aspirations. However, mother and father support affects youth career choices differently. To understand how perceived mothers' and fathers' support affect career interest in computer science (CS), we developed two path models using both mother and father support gains to predict youths' interest in CS. We hypothesized that perceived father's and mother's support would relate to youths' interest in CS via youths' perception of CS utility value as a mediator. We found that both mother and father support leads to interest in CS. However, father support was found to affect CS interest via the mediator utility-value beliefs. To provide explanations for these differences we used student interview data to explore how participants in our study perceived parental support.","authors":["Jody Clarke-Midura","Frederick Poole","Katarina Pantic","Chongning Sun"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3230977.3231003","Conference: the 2018 ACM Conference"],"references":["308791354_Analysis_of_Factors_Influencing_Interest_in_STEM_Career_Comparison_between_American_and_Turkish_High_School_Students_with_High_Ability","276852167_Designing_for_deeper_learning_in_a_blended_computer_science_course_for_middle_school_students","323328152_How_Near_Peer_Mentoring_Affects_Middle_School_Mentees","316751737_Playing_Mentor_A_New_Strategy_for_Recruiting_Young_Women_into_Computer_Science","305726881_Studying_situated_learning_in_a_constructionist_programming_camp_A_multimethod_microgenetic_analysis_of_one_girl's_learning_pathway","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch","296475012_Development_Implementation_and_Outcomes_of_an_Equitable_Computer_Science_After-School_Program_Findings_From_Middle-School_Students","292837704_The_use_of_the_Social_Cognitive_Career_Theory_to_predict_engineering_students'_motivation_in_the_produced_program","271468572_Setting_the_scene_Scaffolding_stories_to_benefit_middle_school_students_learning_to_program","271347990_Fennema-Sherman_Mathematics_Attitudes_Scales_Instruments_Designed_to_Measure_Attitudes_toward_the_Learning_of_Mathematics_by_Females_and_Males"]}
