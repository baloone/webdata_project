{"id":"343821723_Public_Economic_Efficiency_and_Case-Based_Reasoning_A_Theoretical_Framework_to_Police_Performance","abstract":"At present, public efficiency is a concept that intends to maximize return on public investment focus on minimizing the use of resources and maximizing the outputs. The concept takes into account statistical criteria drawn up according to techniques such as DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis). The purpose of the current work is to consider, more precisely, the theoretical application of CBR (Case-Based Reasoning) from economics and computer science, as a preliminary step to improving the efficiency of law enforcement agencies (public sector). With the aim of increasing the efficiency of the public sector, we have entered into a phase whose main objective is the implementation of new technologies. Our main conclusion is that the application of computer techniques, such as CBR, has become key to the efficiency of the public sector, which continues to require economic valuation based on methodologies such as DEA. As a theoretical result and conclusion, the incorporation of CBR systems will reduce the number of inputs and increase, theoretically, the number of outputs generated based on previous computer knowledge.","authors":["Javier Parra Domínguez","Juan Manuel Corchado Rodríguez"],"meta":["July 2020International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering 14(8):537-541"],"references":["263303701_A_General_Methodology_for_Bootstrapping_in_Non-parametric_Frontier_Models","241019931_Yearly_evolution_of_police_efficiency_in_Spain_and_explanatory_factors","226704111_An_introduction_to_case-based_reasoning","225682581_Evaluation_of_the_efficacy_and_effectiveness_of_the_Spanish_security_forces","330452057_Knowledge_Management_in_the_Public_Sector_Principles_and_Practices_in_the_Police_Work","279084697_INFLUENZA_VACCINATION_-_COST-EFFECTIVENESS_AND_PUBLIC-POLICY","259753234_A_Case-Based_Reasoning_Method_for_Locating_Evidence_During_Digital_Forensic_Device_Triage","249795239_Public_Efficiency_and_Private_Choice_in_Higher_Education","227445544_Some_Models_for_Estimating_Technical_and_Scale_Efficiency_in_Data_Envelopment_Analysis","226259721_Statistical_Inference_in_Nonparametric_Frontier_Models_The_State_of_the_Art","221517175_Visualization_in_law_enforcement","221203602_Using_Guidelines_to_Constrain_Interactive_Case-Based_HTN_Planning","222664914_Stages_of_knowledge_management_systems_in_police_investigations","222443692_Measuring_The_Efficiency_of_Decision_Making_Units","221419867_Improved_Efficiency_of_Oil_Well_Drilling_through_Case_Based_Reasoning"]}
