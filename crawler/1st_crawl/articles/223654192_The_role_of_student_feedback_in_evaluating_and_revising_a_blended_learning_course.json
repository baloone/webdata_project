{"id":"223654192_The_role_of_student_feedback_in_evaluating_and_revising_a_blended_learning_course","abstract":"A graduate level course in library and information science was revised from face-to-face instruction to a blended learning model utilizing on site, interactive television, and online classes. This study investigates three related questions: (1) Will students provide detailed feedback if given the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey? (2) Will embedding an online survey within the course management software be an effective method of gathering feedback? (3) Will student feedback contain constructive critical information that will prove useful in evaluating and revising the course? An online survey created within the WebCT course management software was administered in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007. The total number of responses was 71. Results indicate that students were willing to provide detailed feedback, readily accepted the embedded survey, and provided constructive criticism that proved useful in the evaluation and revision process. The study concludes that this method is effective and may be most appropriate for courses with small enrollments.","authors":["Linda S.
