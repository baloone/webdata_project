{"id":"323464053_The_Godparent_Plan_A_Pedagogical_Strategy_for_CS1_Accompaniment_and_CS2_Pedagogical_Enhancement","abstract":"Courses such as CS1 and CS2 can present an interesting pedagogical challenge when it comes to the theory-practice relationship, along with aspects that involve the course's logistics, the programming language used, and the characteristics of the students involved in the process. This study presents an innovative didactic approach, oriented towards the accompaniment of CS1 students by CS2 students at Universidad El Bosque, Colombia, seeking with this Godparent Plan, to provide a personalized accompaniment to first semester students, whereby CS2 students enhance their domain over concepts and skills while accompanying, explaining and teaching younger peers. The results of this study are favorable, outlining a didactic scheme that can be adapted and replicated in other curricular scenarios.","authors":["Pedro Guillermo Feijóo-García","Carlos Hernán Ortiz Buitrago"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.3991/ijep.v8i1.7596","Project: Computer Science and Systems Engineering Education"],"references":["316570381_Cooperative_Learning_Web_Application_for_Water_Care_in_Colombia_-_Manglar_Actor-Network_Theory_Software_Solution","311521113_RoBlock_-_Web_App_for_Programming_Learning","229049298_Learning_to_love_computer_science_Peer_leaders_gain_teaching_skill_communicative_ability_and_content_knowledge_in_the_CS_classroom","229037843_Tutoring_for_retention","200130187_Learning_through_Teaching","300918231_A_Peer_Tutoring_Model_for_Small_Schools_with_Limited_Funding_and_Resources_Abstract_Only","31776742_Creating_Significant_Learning_Experiences_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Designing_College_Courses_LD_Fink"]}
