{"id":"320035828_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","abstract":"An injective coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring where two vertices have distinct colors if a path of length two exists between them. Let χ i (G) be the injective chromatic number of a graph G. In this paper, we investigate the injective coloring of planar graphs with girth 6. We improve some results of Borodin and Ivanova (2011) [1], Doyon et al. (2010) [4] and Li and Xu (2012) [6] by showing that if G is a planar graph with girth at least 6, then (1) χ i (G) ≤ ∆ + 3; (2) χ i (G) ≤ ∆ + 2 if ∆ ≥ 9; (3) χ i (G) ≤ ∆ + 1 if ∆ ≥ 17.","authors":["Wei Dong","Wensong Lin"],"meta":["January 2013"],"references":["257000679_Injective_coloring_of_planar_graphs","251556753_Injective_choosability_of_planar_graphs_of_girth_five_and_six","251299089_Some_results_on_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs","226115143_Injective_D_1-coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_6","222840304_Injective_colorings_of_planar_graphs_with_few_colors","220192588_Some_bounds_on_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs","220189440_On_the_injective_chromatic_number_of_graphs"]}
