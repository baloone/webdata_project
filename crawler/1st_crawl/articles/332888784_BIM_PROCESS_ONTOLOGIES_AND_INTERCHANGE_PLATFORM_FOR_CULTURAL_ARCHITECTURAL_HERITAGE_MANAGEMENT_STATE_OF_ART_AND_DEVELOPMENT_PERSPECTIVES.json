Some experiences of using ontologies for Cultural Heritage frame the state of the art. Specific ontologies for the conservation process allows the definition of classes and their description through attributes. Subjects, means, tools, relationships, and planning of activities, times and costs are included in the process. Ontologies so defined are also the basis for the definition of an interoperability protocol for Cultural Heritage. Interoperability means exchange among the tools, with the guarantee that data and meanings transmitted are correctly interpreted by the receiving system. The paper proposes the kind of informative model for built heritage. Defining the basis for ontologies is the goal. The flow of information in a Common Data Environment, a data exchange platform, is necessary to ensure proper data and process management.","authors":["Alessandra Pili"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W11-969-2019"],"references":["262570598_Semantic_Matching_in_Hierarchical_Ontologies","252069448_The_IFC_Standard_-_A_Review_of_History_Development_and_Standardization","251332115_Ontologies_versus_relational_databases_Are_they_so_different_A_comparison","243772462_Ontology_Development_101_A_Guide_to_Creating_Your_First_Ontology","240156358_Ontology_and_Semantic_Interoperability","221613357_Ontologies_for_semantically_interoperable_systems","309625908_Architectural_heritage_knowledge_modelling_An_ontology-based_framework_for_conservation_process","282316578_Ontology_versus_Database","260557726_A_diagnostic_ontological_model_for_damages_to_historical_constructions","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications"]}
