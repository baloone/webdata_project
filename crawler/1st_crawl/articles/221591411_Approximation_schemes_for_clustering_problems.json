{"id":"221591411_Approximation_schemes_for_clustering_problems","abstract":"Let k be a fixed integer. We consider the problem ofpartitioning an input set of points endowed with a distancefunction into k clusters. We give polynomial timeapproximation schemes for the following three clustering problems:Metric k-Clustering, l 22k-Clustering, and l22 k-Median.In the k-Clustering problem, the objective is to minimizethe sum of all intra-cluster distances. In the k-Medianproblem, the goal is to minimize the sum of distances from pointsin a cluster to the (best choice of) cluster center. In metricinstances, the input distance function is a metric. In l22 instances, the points are in Rd and the distance between two points x,yis measured by x−y 22 (noticethat (R d, ṡ 22 is nota metric space). For the first two problems, our results are thefirst polynomial time approximation schemes. For the third problem,the running time of our algorithms is a vast improvement overprevious work.","authors":["Wenceslas Fernandez de la Vega","Marek Karpinski","Claire Kenyon","Yuval Rabani"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1145/780542.780550","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, June 9-11, 2003, San Diego, CA, USA"],"references":["228057623_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k-median_problem","220780107_Sublinear_Time_Approximate_Clustering","220432228_P-complete_approximation_problems_J_ACM_233_555-565","3671953_Property_Testing_and_Its_Connection_to_Learning_and_Approximation","2743799_Approximate_Max-Flow_Min-MultiCut_Theorems_and_Their_Applications","2514609_Algorithmic_Approaches_to_Clustering_Gene_Expression_Data","2301375_On_the_Hardness_of_Approximating_MAX_k-CUT_and_its_Dual","312970804_Improved_combinatorial_algorithms_for_the_facility_location_and_k-median_problems","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","262392783_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k_-median_problem_extended_abstract","262234261_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Metric_Facility_Location_and_k-Median_Problems","247205572_Polynomial_time_approximation_schemes_for_geometric_clustering_problems","245709378_Entropy_Compactness_and_the_Approximation_of_Operators","240482563_Effi_-_cient_and_effective_querying_by_image_content","234792703_Clustering_in_large_graphs_and_matrices","234780981_Approximating_min-sum_k_-clustering_in_metric_spaces","228057551_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Dense_Instances_of_NP-Hard_Problems","226238228_Efficient_and_Effective_Querying_by_Image_Content","225389897_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Clustering","225249640_Color_Indexing","222489042_On_Two_Segmentation_Problems","222483542_Approximation_algorithms_for_min-sum_p-clustering","222391121_Syntactic_Clustering_of_the_Web","221590487_Clustering_for_edge-cost_minimization_extended_abstract","220430816_Polynomial-time_approximation_schemes_for_geometric_Min-Sum_median_clustering","220139107_A_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_Metric_MIN-BISECTION","3880909_Testing_of_clustering","3832164_A_sublinear_time_approximation_scheme_for_clustering_in_metric_spaces","2913205_Approximate_Clustering_via_Core-Sets","2450711_Greedy_Strikes_Back_Improved_Facility_Location_Algorithms","2441960_Approximation_schemes_for_Euclidean_k-Medians_And_Related_Problems","2307057_Clustering_for_Edge-Cost_Minimization","2304804_Segmentation_Problems"]}
