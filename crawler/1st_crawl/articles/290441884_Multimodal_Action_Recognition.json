{"id":"290441884_Multimodal_Action_Recognition","abstract":"For many machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, most of the data are high dimensional, such as human action videos. Vectorization of action video is one common approach to dealing with the high dimensionality issue. However, the vectorization process requires a huge amount of memory, and it is also very time consuming.
