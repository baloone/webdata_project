{"id":"291387844_Energy-Based_Magnetization_and_Magnetostriction_Modeling_of_Grain-Oriented_Silicon_Steel_Under_Vectorial_Excitations","abstract":"The assembled domain structure model (ADSM) is an energy-based macroscopic magnetization model of a core material. In this paper, we used the ADSM to simulate the magnetization curves and magnetostriction of a grain-oriented (GO) silicon steel sheet under vectorial excitations, and we measured the same sheet using the rotational single-sheet tester with a three-element strain gage rosette. In the simulation, the target value of the average magnetization vector representing unidirectional or rotational magnetic flux is given as a known parameter. We obtained the magnetization state by finding the external magnetic field vector and state vectors, satisfying the criteria that the average magnetization vector equals the target value and that the total magnetic energy is locally minimized. The simulation reconstructed the magnetostriction produced by the 90Â° domain-wall motion under unidirectional magnetization as well as the vectorial contraction and extension under rotational magnetization.","authors":["Shunpei Ito","Takeshi Mifune","Tetsuji Matsuo","Chikara Kaido"],"meta":["May 2016IEEE Transactions on Magnetics 52(5):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMAG.2016.2519602"],"references":["223116448_Magnetic_vector_hysteresis_model_with_dry_friction-like_pinning","276910969_Macroscopic_magnetization_modeling_of_silicon_steel_sheets_using_an_assembly_of_six-domain_particles","272362201_Modeling_2-D_Magnetostriction_in_Nonoriented_Electrical_Steels_Using_a_Simple_Magnetic_Domain_Model","271367704_Magnetic_Domains_The_Analysis_of_Magnetic_Microstructures_Springer","258369332_Micromagnetism_and_the_Microstructure_of_Ferromagnetic_Solids","257971891_Magnetization_modeling_of_silicon_steel_using_a_simplified_domain_structure_model","224171103_A_General_Vector_Hysteresis_Operator_Extension_to_the_3-D_Case","224157255_Anisotropic_Vector_Hysteresis_Model_Using_an_Isotropic_Vector_Play_Model","223907612_Multiscale_modeling_of_the_magneto-mechanical_behavior_of_grain-oriented_silicon_steels","222688256_Reversible_magneto-elastic_behavior_A_multiscale_approach"]}
