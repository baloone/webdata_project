{"id":"325833030_Knowledge_transfer_from_research_to_industry_a_survey_on_program_comprehension","abstract":"The number of scientific publications is continuously increasing, with most publications describing research that is also interesting for industrial software engineers. Program comprehension in particular is an essential and time consuming task in industry, but new approaches are rarely adopted. We conducted a survey with 89 participants from research and industry to investigate this problem. Our results indicate that researchers have to integrate other ways to communicate their work and make evaluations more practical.","authors":["Ivonne von Nostitz-Wallwitz","Jacob Kr√ºger","Janet Siegmund","Thomas Leich"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3183440.3194980","Conference: the 40th International Conference"],"references":["345151000_Comprehending_Studies_on_Program_Comprehension","317115621_Identifying_Innovative_Documents_Quo_vadis","303480902_Program_Comprehension_Past_Present_and_Future","38310496_Publish_or_perish_A_systematic_review_of_interventions_to_increase_academic_publication_rates"]}
