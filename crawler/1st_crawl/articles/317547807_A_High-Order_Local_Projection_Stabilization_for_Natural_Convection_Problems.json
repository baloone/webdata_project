{"id":"317547807_A_High-Order_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_Natural_Convection_Problems","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a local projection stabilization (LPS) finite element method applied to numerically solve natural convection problems. This method replaces the projection-stabilized structure of standard LPS methods by an interpolation-stabilized structure, which only acts on the high frequencies components of the flow. This approach gives rise to a method which may be cast in the variational multi-scale framework, and constitutes a low-cost, accurate solver (of optimal error order) for incompressible flows, despite being only weakly consistent. Numerical simulations and results for the buoyancy-driven airflow in a square cavity with differentially heated side walls at high Rayleigh numbers (up to Ra = 10ˆ{7}) are given and compared with benchmark solutions. Good accuracy is obtained with relatively coarse grids.","authors":["Tomás Chacón Rebollo","Macarena Gómez Mármol","Frédéric Hecht","Samuele Rubino"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Scientific Computing 74(2):667-692","DOI:10.1007/s10915-017-0469-9","Projects: Numerical modeling of the inner thermo-aerodynamics coupling by Reduced Order Models oriented to the eco-efficient design of buildingsEfficient parallelization of projection-stabilized methods for the development of improved ROM of aero-thermal flows in buildings"],"references":["280113032_Local_projection_stabilization_for_the_Oseen_problem","318107835_Stabilized_finite_element_methods_for_the_generalized_Oseen_problem","304748239_Analysis_of_a_Full_Space-Time_Discretization_of_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations_by_a_Local_Projection_Stabilization_Method","304747862_Finite_Element_Approximation_of_an_Unsteady_Projection-Based_VMS_Turbulence_Model_with_Wall_Laws","302434881_Compact_sets_in_the_space_L_p0_T_B_Ann","287643291_A_Review_of_Variational_Multiscale_Methods_for_the_Simulation_of_Turbulent_Incompressible_Flows","285599503_Boundary-Layer_Theory","281910704_A_reduced_discrete_inf-sup_condition_in_L_p_for_incompressible_flows_and_application","276481718_Numerical_Analysis_of_Penalty_Stabilized_Finite_Element_Discretizations_of_Evolution_Navier-Stokes_Equations","273340550_Local_projection_type_stabilization_applied_to_inf-sup_stable_discretizations_of_the_Oseen_problem","268615249_A_local_projection_stabilization_finite_element_method_with_nonlinear_crosswind_diffusion_for_convection-diffusion-reaction_equations","270007756_Local_projection_FEM_stabilization_for_the_time-dependent_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_problem_LPS_For_The_Navier-Stokes_Problem","269401530_Numerical_analysis_of_a_finite_element_projection-based_VMS_turbulence_model_with_wall_laws","268634817_An_Introduction_to_the_Navier-Stokes_Initial-Boundary_Value_Problem","267433895_A_high_order_term-by-term_stabilization_solver_for_incompressible_flow_problems"]}
