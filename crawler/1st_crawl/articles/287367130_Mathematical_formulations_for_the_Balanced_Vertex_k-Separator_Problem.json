{"id":"287367130_Mathematical_formulations_for_the_Balanced_Vertex_k-Separator_Problem","abstract":"Given an indirected graph G = (V;E), a Vertex k-Separator is a subset of the vertex set V such that, when the separator is removed from the graph, the remaining vertices can be partitioned into k subsets that are pairwise edge-disconnected. In this paper we focus on the Balanced Vertex k-Separator Problem, i.e., the problem of finding a minimum cardinality separator such that the sizes of the resulting disconnected subsets are balanced. We present a compact Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem, and present a polyhedral study of the associated polytope. We also present an Exponential-Size formulation, for which we derive a column generation and a branching scheme. Preliminary computational results are reported comparing the performance of the two formulations on a set of benchmark instances.","authors":["Denis Cornaz","Fabio Furini","Mathieu Lacroix","Enrico Malaguti"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/CoDIT.2014.6996889"],"references":["243099121_Kumar_V_Parallel_Multilevel_k-way_Partitioning_Scheme_for_Irregular_Graphs_SIAM_Review_412_278-300","242479489_Kumar_V_A_Fast_and_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_for_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs_SIAM_Journal_on_Scientific_Computing_201_359-392","225251159_Multilevel_Refinement_for_Combinatorial_Optimisation_Problems","220249450_An_exact_algorithm_for_solving_the_vertex_separator_problem","230596728_Column_Generation","230596035_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Planar_Graphs","225129442_Partitioning_Planar_Graphs_with_Vertex_Costs_Algorithms_and_Applications","220589356_The_vertex_separator_problem_A_polyhedral_investigation","220588782_The_vertex_separator_problem_Algorithms_and_computations","220224407_A_Divide-and-Conquer_Approach_to_the_Minimum_k_-Way_Cut_Problem"]}
