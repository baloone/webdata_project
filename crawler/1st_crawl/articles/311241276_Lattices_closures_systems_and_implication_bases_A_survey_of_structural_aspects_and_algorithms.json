{"id":"311241276_Lattices_closures_systems_and_implication_bases_A_survey_of_structural_aspects_and_algorithms","abstract":"Concept lattices and closed set lattices are graphs with the lattice property. They have been increasingly used this last decade in various domains of computer science, such as data mining, knowledge representation, databases or information retrieval. A fundamental result of lattice theory establishes that any lattice is the concept lattice of its binary table. A consequence is the existence of a bijective link between lattices, contexts (via the table) and a set of implicational rules (via the canonical (direct) basis). The possible transformations between these objects give rise to relevant tools for data analysis.","authors":["Karell Bertet","Christophe Demko","Jean-François Viaud","Clément Guérin"],"meta":["November 2016Theoretical Computer Science","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.11.021"],"references":["281329382_Reconciling_Expressivity_and_Usability_in_Information_Access","281327547_Computing_Proper_Implications","320839043_Two_Basic_Algorithms_in_Concept_Analysis","313517061_Horn_Formulas_Directed_Hypergraphs_Lattices_and_Closure_Systems_Related_Formalism_and_Application_Preface","310625453_Reduction_dimension_of_bags_of_visual_words_with_FCA","299307948_Reduction_dimension_of_bags_of_visual_words_with_FCA","286707660_Enumerating_pseudo-intents_in_a_partial_order","279347205_Formal_Concept_Analysis","279257398_Generation_algorithm_of_a_concept_lattice_with_limited_object_access","276275826_Ensembles_ordonnes_finis_Concepts_resultats_et_usages"]}
