{"id":"308957955_Self-regulated_learning_strategies_predict_learner_behavior_and_goal_attainment_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_In_press","abstract":"Individuals with strong self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, characterized by the ability to plan, manage and control their learning process, can learn faster and achieve higher grades compared to those with weaker SRL skills. SRL is critical in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance, as is commonly the case in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Learners can be trained to engage in SRL and further supported by facilitating prompts, activities, and tools. However, effective implementation of learner support systems in MOOCs requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in learner behavior. Moreover, identifying learner characteristics that are predictive of weaker SRL skills can advance efforts to provide targeted support without obtrusive survey instruments. We investigated SRL in a sample of 4831 learners across six MOOCs based on individual records of overall course achievement, interactions with course content, and survey responses. Results indicated that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking appeared to be counterproductive. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. Several learner characteristics, including demographics and motivation, predicted learners’ SRL skills. We discuss implications and next steps towards online learning environments that provide targeted support and guidance.","authors":["René F Kizilcec","Mar Pérez-Sanagustín","Jorge J.
