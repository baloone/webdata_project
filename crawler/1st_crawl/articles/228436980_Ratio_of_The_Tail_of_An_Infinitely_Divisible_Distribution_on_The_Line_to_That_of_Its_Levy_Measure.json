{"id":"228436980_Ratio_of_The_Tail_of_An_Infinitely_Divisible_Distribution_on_The_Line_to_That_of_Its_Levy_Measure","abstract":"A necessary and sufficient condition for the tail of an infinitely divisible distribution on the real line to be estimated by the tail of its Levy measure is found. The lower limit and the upper limit of the ratio of the right tail (mu) over bar (r) of an infinitely divisible distribution mu to the right tail (nu) over bar (r) of its Levy measure nu as r -> infinity are estimated from above and below by reviving Teugels's classical method. The exponential class and the dominated varying class are studied in detail.","authors":["Toshiro Watanabe","Kouji Yamamuro"],"meta":["January 2010ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY 15(none):44-74","DOI:10.1214/EJP.v15-732"],"references":["46652885_Ruin_Probabilities_and_Overshoots_for_General_Levy_Insurance_Risk_Processes","2135310_On_lower_limits_and_equivalences_for_distribution_tails_of_randomly_stopped_sums","2123009_Lower_limits_and_equivalences_for_convolution_tails","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","266226260_One-sided_Analogues_of_Karamata's_Regular_Variation","265665105_Subexponential_Distributions_and_Dominated-Variation_Tails","265456940_On_the_Non-Closure_under_Convolution_of_the_Subexponential_Family","264995908_Modelling_Extremal_Events-_For_Insurance_and_Finance","247589296_Some_Results_on_Regular_Variation_for_Distributions_in_Queueing_and_Fluctuation_Theory","243104955_Convolution_Equivalence_and_Infinite_Divisibility_Corrections_and_Corollaries","243100378_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_a_Class_of_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","243034695_Convolutions_of_Distributions_With_Exponential_and_Subexponential_Tails","243034442_A_limit_theorem_for_the_tails_of_discrete_infinitely_divisible_laws_with_applications_to_fluctuation_theory","243010336_The_full_solution_of_the_convolution_closure_problem_for_convolution-equivalent_distributions","239666097_Levy_Processes_and_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","231958634_A_note_on_the_closure_of_convolution_power_mixtures_random_sums_of_exponential","228057717_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_II","227423915_On_convolution_tails","227014601_Subexponentiality_and_infinite_divisibility","226520732_Convolution_equivalence_and_distributions_of_random_sums","226363518_Sample_function_behavior_of_increasing_processes_of_class_L","225906241_Local_Subexponentiality_and_Self-decomposability","222784378_Suprema_and_sojourn_times_of_Levy_processes_with_exponential_tails","222638570_On_the_asymptotic_behaviour_of_Levy_processes_Part_I_Subexponential_and_exponential_processes","222308248_Functionals_of_infinitely_divisible_stochastic_processes_with_exponential_tails","222199010_Dominated_variation_and_related_concepts_and_Tauberian_theorems_for_Laplace_transforms","38362652_Limits_of_Ratios_of_Tails_of_Measures","38362427_The_Class_of_Subexponential_Distributions","38361870_Comparing_the_Tail_of_an_Infinitely_Divisible_Distribution_with_Integrals_of_its_Levy_Measure","38350689_Convolution_equivalence_and_infinite_divisibility","38322422_Infinite_divisibility_and_generalized_subexponentiality","23635429_On_a_class_of_Levy_processes"]}
