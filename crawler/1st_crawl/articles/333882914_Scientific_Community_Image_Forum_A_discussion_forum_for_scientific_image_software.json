{"id":"333882914_Scientific_Community_Image_Forum_A_discussion_forum_for_scientific_image_software","abstract":"Forums and email lists play a major role in assisting scientists in using software. Previously, each open-source bioimaging software package had its own distinct forum or email list. Although each provided access to experts from various software teams, this fragmentation resulted in many scientists not knowing where to begin with their projects. Thus, the scientific imaging community lacked a central platform where solutions could be discussed in an open, software-independent manner. In response, we introduce the Scientific Community Imaging Forum, where users can pose software-related questions about digital image analysis, acquisition, and data management.","authors":["Curtis Rueden","Jeanelle Ackerman","Ellen T.A.
