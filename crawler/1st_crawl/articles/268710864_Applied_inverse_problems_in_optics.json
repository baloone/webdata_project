{"id":"268710864_Applied_inverse_problems_in_optics","abstract":"The importance of inversion methods for the analysis of experimental data obtained in various fields and, in particular, in optics has no longer to be emphasized. Many light scattering experiments can be described by linear models and give rise to ill-posed linear inverse problems. This chapter discusses a few examples of such problems encountered in confocal scanning microscopy, and in particle sizing and velocimetry. A common characteristic of these inverse problems is their rather severe ill-posedness. Therefore, little information about the solution is contained in the data, and there is no need for very sophisticated inversion procedures. The experimentalist instead requires fast, reliable, and easy-to-implement algorithms for extracting information from his noisy measurements in an economic way. The chapter discusses focuses on recent work in that direction and on methods that appear to be particularly useful for problems characterized by a small number of degrees of freedom, that is, the computation of regularized solutions by means of singular function expansions.","authors":["M.
