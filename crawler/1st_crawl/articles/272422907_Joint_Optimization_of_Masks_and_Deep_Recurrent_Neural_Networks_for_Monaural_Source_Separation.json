{"id":"272422907_Joint_Optimization_of_Masks_and_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Monaural_Source_Separation","abstract":"Monaural source separation is important for many real world applications. It\nis challenging in that, given only single channel information is available,\nthere is an infinite number of solutions without proper constraints. In this\npaper, we explore joint optimization of masking functions and deep recurrent\nneural networks for monaural source separation tasks, including the monaural\nspeech separation task, monaural singing voice separation task, and speech\ndenoising task. The joint optimization of the deep recurrent neural networks\nwith an extra masking layer enforces a reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we\nexplore a discriminative training criterion for the neural networks to further\nenhance the separation performance. We evaluate our proposed system on TSP,\nMIR-1K, and TIMIT dataset for speech separation, singing voice separation, and\nspeech denoising tasks, respectively. Our approaches achieve 2.30~4.98 dB SDR\ngain compared to NMF models in the speech separation task, 2.30~2.48 dB GNSDR\ngain and 4.32~5.42 dB GSIR gain compared to previous models in the singing\nvoice separation task, and outperform NMF and DNN baseline in the speech\ndenoising task.","authors":["Po-Sen Huang","Minje Kim","Mark Hasegawa-Johnson","Paris Smaragdis"],"meta":["February 2015IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing 23(12)","DOI:10.1109/TASLP.2015.2468583","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308832054_Speech_Separation_based_on_signal-noise-dependent_deep_neural_networks_for_robust_speech_recognition","282729938_Deep_neural_network_based_speech_separation_for_robust_speech_recognition","281786827_Discriminatively_trained_recurrent_neural_networks_for_single-channel_speech_separation","271328564_DEEP_STACKING_NETWORKS_WITH_TIME_SERIES_FOR_SPEECH_SEPARATION","269295622_Single-channel_speech_separation_with_memory-enhanced_recurrent_neural_networks","269295349_Deep_stacking_networks_with_time_series_for_speech_separation","310604250_Training_and_analysing_deep_recurrent_neural_networks","286995924_Experiments_on_deep_learning_for_speech_denoising","284878749_Source_separation_with_scattering_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization","272436458_A_Regression_Approach_to_Speech_Enhancement_Based_on_Deep_Neural_Networks"]}
