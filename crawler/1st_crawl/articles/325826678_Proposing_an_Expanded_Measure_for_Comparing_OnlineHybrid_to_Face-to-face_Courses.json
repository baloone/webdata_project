{"id":"325826678_Proposing_an_Expanded_Measure_for_Comparing_OnlineHybrid_to_Face-to-face_Courses","abstract":"Online education continues to increase. With increased online offerings, it is important to evaluate the integrity or equivalence of online/hybrid courses relative to face-to-face (F2F) courses. This study used three separate samples of business undergraduates taking both online/hybrid and F2F courses in the same semester (i.e., mixed course delivery format), across summer, fall and spring semesters. Eight items were used to assess studentsâ€™ perceived favorability of online courses (PFoOC) compared to F2F courses. Across all three samples, two related but distinct sources for course comparison consistently emerged, instructor-related and peer related. An eight-item measure represents a necessary improvement over a previously developed four-item PFoOC measure, because it allows for additional relevant item comparisons between online/hybrid versus F2F courses. It is hoped that this measure can be used to further research evaluating online education.","authors":["Gary Blau","Sherry Jarrell","Anthony Seeton","Tim Young"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Education and Development 2(2):1","DOI:10.20849/jed.v2i2.400"],"references":["318043659_The_Determinants_of_Students'_Perceived_Learning_Outcomes_and_Satisfaction_in_University_Online_Education_An_Update","274970496_What_Might_Online_Delivery_Teach_Us_About_Blended_Management_Education_Prior_Perspectives_and_Future_Directions","319453314_Exploring_Differences_in_Business_Undergraduate_Perceptions_by_Preferred_Classroom_Delivery_Mode","315540924_Faculty_Perceptions_about_Teaching_Online_Exploring_the_Literature_Using_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_as_an_Organizing_Framework","311359425_Correlates_of_perceived_favorability_of_online_courses_for_quantitative_versus_qualitative_undergraduate_business_majors","308274728_Business_Student_Perceptions_of_Online_Learning_Using_Focus_Groups_for_Richer_Understanding_of_Student_Perspectives","305339030_Correlates_of_Business_Undergraduates'_Perceived_Favorability_of_Online_Compared_to_Face-to-Face_Courses","302980880_Evaluating_Characteristics_of_Top_and_Bottom_Performance_Online_Versus_In-Class","277563569_Do_low_survey_response_rates_bias_results_Evidence_from_Japan","276350577_Factors_That_Affect_Students'_Capacity_to_Fulfill_the_Role_of_Online_Learner"]}
