{"id":"283520324_Cyber-physical_production_systems_Roots_from_manufacturing_science_and_technology","abstract":"One of the most significant directions in the development of computer science and information and communication technologies is represented by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are systems of collaborating computational entities which are in intensive connection with the surrounding physical world and its on-going processes, providing and using, at the same time, data-accessing and data-processing services available on the internet. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4.0. The paper underlines that there are significant roots generally -and particularly in the CIRP community -which point towards CPPS. Expectations and the related new R&D challenges are also outlined.","authors":["Laszlo Monostori"],"meta":["January 2015at - Automatisierungstechnik 63(10)","DOI:10.1515/auto-2015-0066"],"references":["287598080_Research_and_Applications_of_Cloud_Manufacturing_in_China","321612689_Industrie_40_in_Produktion_Automatisierung_und_Logistik_Anwendung_Technologien_Migration","306219443_Sustainable_increase_of_overhead_productivity_due_to_cyber-physicalsystems","306204452_Auf_dem_Weg_zur_selbstuberwachenden_Werkzeugmaschinen","306202113_Intelligent_Manufacturing_Systems-_A_Tentative_Forecast","306202041_Sensoren_fur_die_digitale_Produktion","306200031_Synthesis_and_Emergence_Proceedings_of_International_Workshop_on_Emergent_Syn","306153957_Kollaborative_cyber-physische_produktionssysteme_Ausbruch_aus_der_produktivitatsfalle","306153231_Holonic_control_of_manufacturing_systems","289827097_Agile_Automation_Systems_Based_on_Cyber-Physical_Systems_and_Service-Oriented_Architectures"]}
