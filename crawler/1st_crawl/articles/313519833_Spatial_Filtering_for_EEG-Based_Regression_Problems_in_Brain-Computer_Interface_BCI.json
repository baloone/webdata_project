{"id":"313519833_Spatial_Filtering_for_EEG-Based_Regression_Problems_in_Brain-Computer_Interface_BCI","abstract":"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are frequently used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises, so preprocessing must be done before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for classification or regression. Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47%.","authors":["Dongrui Wu","Jung-Tai King","Chun-Hsiang Chuang","Chin-Teng Lin"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2688423","Project: Machine learning for brain-computer interface"],"references":["313587631_Offline_EEG-based_driver_drowsiness_estimation_using_enhanced_batch-mode_active_learning_EBMAL_for_regression","313585725_Spectral_meta-learner_for_regression_SMLR_model_aggregation_Towards_calibrationless_brain-computer_interface_BCI","312854561_EEGLAB_an_open_source_toolbox_for_analysis_of_single-trial_EEG_dynamics","311165382_Driver_Drowsiness_Estimation_From_EEG_Signals_Using_Online_Weighted_Adaptation_Regularization_for_Regression_OwARR","309081076_Online_and_Offline_Domain_Adaptation_for_Reducing_BCI_Calibration_Effort","290204391_Investigating_the_correlation_between_the_neural_activity_and_task_performance_in_a_psychomotor_vigilance_test","304293010_Selective_Transfer_Learning_for_EEG-Based_Drowsiness_Detection","303517727_The_use_of_fast_Fourier_transform_for_the_estimation_of_power_spectra","290829363_Protection_of_human_subjects_45_Code_of_Federal_Regulations_46","284679774_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Theory_and_Applications","281526313_Online_Driver's_Drowsiness_Estimation_Using_Domain_Adaptation_with_Model_Fusion","278674350_The_PREP_Pipeline_Standardized_preprocessing_for_large-scale_EEG_analysis","277717975_A_Comparison_of_ERP_Spatial_Filtering_Methods_for_Optimal_Mental_Workload_Estimation","274397371_EEG_artifact_removal_-_State-of-the-art_and_guidelines","279384963_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Factor_Analysis"]}
