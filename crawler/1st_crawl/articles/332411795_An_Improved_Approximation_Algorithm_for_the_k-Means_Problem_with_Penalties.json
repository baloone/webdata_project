{"id":"332411795_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Means_Problem_with_Penalties","abstract":"The clustering problem has been paid lots of attention in various fields of compute science. However, in many applications, the existence of noisy data poses a big challenge for the clustering problem. As one way to deal with clustering problem with noisy data, clustering with penalties has been studied extensively, such as the k-median problem with penalties and the facility location problem with penalties. As far as we know, there is only one approximation algorithm for the k-means problem with penalties with ratio \\(25+\\epsilon \\). All the previous related results for the clustering with penalties problems were based on the techniques of local search, LP-rounding, or primal-dual, which cannot be applied directly to the k-means problem with penalties to get better approximation ratio than \\(25+\\epsilon \\). In this paper, we apply primal-dual technique to solve the k-means problem with penalties by a different rounding method, i.e., employing a deterministic rounding algorithm, instead of using the randomized rounding algorithm used in the previous approximation schemes. Based on the above method, an approximation algorithm with ratio \\(19.849+\\epsilon \\) is presented for the k-means problem with penalties.","authors":["Qilong Feng","Zhen Zhang","Feng Shi","Jianxin Wang"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-18126-0_15","In book: Codes, Cryptology and Information Security (pp.170-181)"],"references":["311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","220779967_Data_reduction_for_weighted_and_outlier-resistant_clustering","220779760_Algorithms_for_facility_location_problems_with_outliers","220431812_Linear-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Clustering_Problems_in_Any_Dimensions","220343586_NP-hardness_of_Euclidean_sum-of-squares_clustering","2533772_Greedy_Facility_Location_Algorithms_Analyzed_using_Dual_Fitting_with_Factor-Revealing_LP","332770699_Local_Search_Yields_Approximation_Schemes_for_k-Means_and_k-Median_in_Euclidean_and_Minor-Free_Metrics","332768551_Local_Search_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Means_in_Doubling_Metrics","329394703_Epsilon-Coresets_for_Clustering_with_Outliers_in_Doubling_Metrics","323567842_An_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k_-median_problem_with_uniform_penalties_via_pseudo-solution","322213600_Approximation_Schemes_for_Clustering_with_Outliers","321066393_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","320891400_Constant_Approximation_for_k-Median_and_k-Means_with_Outliers_via_Iterative_Rounding","318576277_Distributed_Partial_Clustering","318185069_A_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-means_Problem_with_Penalties","316900816_Local_search_methods_for_k-means_with_outliers","314295725_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k_-Median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","312237880_Local_Search_Yields_Approximation_Schemes_for_k-Means_and_k-Median_in_Euclidean_and_Minor-Free_Metrics","301879242_Local_search_yields_approximation_schemes_for_k-means_and_k-median_in_Euclidean_and_minor-free_metrics","301837348_Local_Search_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Means_in_Doubling_Metrics","301706373_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","280104557_A_bi-criteria_approximation_algorithm_for_k_Means","251328776_Local_Search_Algorithms_for_the_Red-Blue_Median_Problem","228732507_A_constant_factor_approximation_algorithm_for_k-median_clustering_with_outliers","227273551_On_Approximate_Geometric_k-Clustering","222543557_A_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-Means_Clustering","220780341_A_constant_factor_approximation_algorithm_for","220778887_K-Means_The_Advantages_of_Careful_Seeding","220111511_An_LP_rounding_algorithm_for_approximating_uncapacitated_facility_location_problem_with_penalties"]}
