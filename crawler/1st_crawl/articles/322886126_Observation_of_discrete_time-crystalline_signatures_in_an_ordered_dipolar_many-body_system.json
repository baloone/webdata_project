{"id":"322886126_Observation_of_discrete_time-crystalline_signatures_in_an_ordered_dipolar_many-body_system","abstract":"A discrete time crystal (DTC) is a robust phase of driven systems which breaks the discrete time translation symmetry of the driving Hamiltonian. Recent experiments have observed DTC signatures in two distinct systems. Here we show NMR observations of DTC signatures in a third, strikingly different system: an ordered spatial crystal. We use a novel DTC echo experiment to probe the coherence of the driven system. Finally, we show that interactions during the pulse of the DTC sequence contribute to the decay of the signal, complicating attempts to measure the intrinsic lifetime of the DTC.","authors":["Jared Rovny","Robert L.
