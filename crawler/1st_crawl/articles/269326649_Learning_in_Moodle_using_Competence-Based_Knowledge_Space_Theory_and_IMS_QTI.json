{"id":"269326649_Learning_in_Moodle_using_Competence-Based_Knowledge_Space_Theory_and_IMS_QTI","abstract":"The Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment (Moodle) LMS is currently a powerful tool in the educational process, as it supports web-based courses and quizzes, along with providing tools for communication and collaboration. Moodle can be considered as the best platform to support adaptive learning. Using a quiz component is critical to providing an adequate level of adaptation in e-assessment. This paper proposes an implementation of Competence-Based Knowledge Space Theory (CbKST) within Moodle which delivers assessments using an IMS QTI-compliant application. This implementation enhances adaptability, interoperability, portability, and reusability of e-assessments. The paper explores CbKST, a framework for domain and learner knowledge representation which constitutes the basis for meaningful learning paths adapted to the learners' knowledge state. We introduce IMS QTI and its application for managing, verifying, and delivering e-assessments. The proposed system architecture is presented, and key benefits of the implementation are identified and suggestions for future work are provided.","authors":["Onjira Sitthisak","Lester Gilbert","Dietrich Albert"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICSEC.2013.6694752","Conference: 2013 International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC)"],"references":["267846725_Providing_Adaptivity_in_Moodle_LMS_Courses","266522902_CURRICULUM_DESIGN_ADAPTATION_EXECUTION_AND_MONITORING_IN_MOODLE","263849207_Concept_tagging_in_Moodle","263007738_HEAJISC_Open_Education_Resources_project_Finding_Electronic_Teaching_Learning_and_Assessment_Resources_FETLAR","237291316_Supporting_Web-based_Learning_through_Adaptive_Assessment","229019814_Adaptive_innovation_and_a_MOODLE-based_VLE_to_support_a_Fully_Online_MSc_Business_Information_Technology_BIT_at_the_University_of_East_London_UEL","224148772_Open_source_learning_management_systems_in_e-learning_and_Moodle","224088664_Work_in_progress_-_assessing_adaptive_expertise_in_physiology_using_online_challenge_modules_in_biofluids","221136090_Evaluation_of_APeLS_-_An_Adaptive_eLearning_Service_Based_on_the_Multi-model_Metadata-Driven_Approach","221002832_A_Module_for_Adaptive_Course_Configuration_and_Assessment_in_Moodle","39996582_Delivery_of_QTIv2_question_types","39994282_R2Q2_Rendering_and_Reponses_Processing_for_QTIv2_Question_Types","26537100_A_Delivery_Engine_for_QTI_Assessments","351625862_Knowledge_Spaces_Theories_Empirical_Research_and_Applications","277758614_Mind_over_Matter_Transforming_Course_Management_Systems_into_Effective_Learning_Environments","268371285_The_development_of_online_assessment_in_the_Moodle_Virtual_Learning_Environment_VLE_as_a_replacement_for_traditional_written_assessment","246440449_IMS_Question_Test_Interoperability_Specification","228599193_Language_learning_on_the_World_Wide_Web_Toward_a_framework_of_network_based_CALL","221266619_Adaptive_Assessment_in_Web-Based_Learning","220886561_Personalising_Learning_through_Prerequisite_Structures_Derived_from_Concept_Maps","4175072_An_evaluation_of_open_source_e-learning_platforms_stressing_adaptation_issues"]}
