{"id":"283205746_First_reformulated_zagreb_index_and_some_graph_operations","abstract":"In this paper some exact expressions for the ï¿½rst re-\nformulated Zagreb index of graph operations containing Cartesian\nproduct, composition, join, corona product, splice, link and chain of\ngraphs will be presented. We apply these results to some graphs to\nchemical and general interest, such as C4 nanotube, rectangular grid,\nopen fence, Fan graph, wheel.","authors":["Muhammad Kamran Jamil","Ioan Tomescu"],"meta":["January 2016Ars Combinatoria -Waterloo then Winnipeg- 138"],"references":["279662654_Further_Properties_of_the_Second_Zagreb_Index","271194704_Eccentric_connectivity_index_of_composite_graphs","257869730_The_multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_graph_operations","249313581_On_Zagreb_and_Harary_Indices","225431837_Some_properties_of_the_reformulated_Zagreb_indices","222123616_The_hyper-Wiener_index_of_graph_operations","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","220567486_The_first_and_second_Zagreb_indices_of_some_graph_operations","8117008_On_reformulated_Zagreb_indices"]}
