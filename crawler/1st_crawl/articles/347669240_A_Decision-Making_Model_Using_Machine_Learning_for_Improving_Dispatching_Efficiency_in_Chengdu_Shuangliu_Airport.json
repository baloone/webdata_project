{"id":"347669240_A_Decision-Making_Model_Using_Machine_Learning_for_Improving_Dispatching_Efficiency_in_Chengdu_Shuangliu_Airport","abstract":"Due to the increasing number of people traveling by air, the passenger flow at the airport is increasing, and the problem of passenger drop-off and pickup has a huge impact on urban traffic. The difficulty of taking a taxi at the airport is still a hot issue in the society. Aiming at the problem of optimizing the allocation of taxi resource, this paper is based on the cost-benefit analysis method to determine the factors that affect the taxi driver's decision-making. The mathematical methods such as function equation, BP neural network algorithm, and queuing theory were used to establish a complete decision-making model for taxi drivers and an optimization model of dispatching efficiency at the airport. A conclusion has been drawn that the allocation of airport taxi resource should be arranged closely related to drivers' revenue and the layout of airport line.","authors":["Yingmiao Qian","Shuhang Chen","Jianchang Li","Qinxin Ren"],"meta":["December 2020Complexity 2020(8):1-16","DOI:10.1155/2020/6626937"],"references":["344877912_A_Computing_Model_for_Quantifying_the_Value_of_Structural_Health_Monitoring_Information_in_Bridge_Engineering","344627097_Evolutionary_Game_Simulation_on_Government_Incentive_Strategies_of_Prefabricated_Construction_A_System_Dynamics_Approach","344372467_A_Comprehensive_Assessment_Approach_for_Water-Soil_Environmental_Risk_during_Railway_Construction_in_Ecological_Fragile_Region_Based_on_AHP_and_MEA","275537489_Technical_Methods_of_Comprehensive_Transportation_Plans_in_the_Airport_Economic_Zone-taking_Xiaogan_Airport_Economic_Zone_as_a_Case","346692386_Contributions_of_advanced_taxi_time_calculation_to_airport_operations_efficiency","333379880_Road_transportation_network_planning_and_design_based_on_the_BP_neural_network","286363913_Design_of_Modified_HRRN_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_priority_systems_Using_Hybrid_Priority_scheme","284312273_Collaborative_Virtual_Queue_Benefit_Analysis_of_a_Collaborative_Decision_Making_Concept_Applied_to_Congested_Airport_Departure_Operations","281982401_Effect_of_Snow_Temperature_and_Their_Interaction_on_Highway_Truck_Traffic","271977700_The_Analysis_of_Demand_Characteristics_of_Passenger_Transportation_Based_on_BP_Neural_Network"]}
