{"id":"242637115_Differences_in_Computer_Attitudes_and_Performance_Among_Re-entry_and_Traditional_College_Students","abstract":"This article describes a study conducted to compare the attitudes and performance of re-entry and traditional college students enrolled in a computer literacy course. The attitudes of these students toward learning about computers were assessed before participation in the course, and the studentsâ€™ computer knowledge and their performance of computer skills were examined after they participated in the course. Results suggest that re-entry students have greater confidence and somewhat more interest in learning about computers than do traditional students. In addition, re-entry students outperformed their traditional-student counterparts on computer knowledge objectives. Both groups performed equally well on computer skill objectives. Implications for educators who teach college computer courses are discussed.","authors":["I. D.
