The Research Center has been founded by three Italian Universities through five Departments. It represents the connection between Statistics and Engineering. The five Departments promoting it are the following: Department of Innovation and Information Engineering (Guglielmo Marconi University, Rome); Department of Statistics Computer Science Applications, Department of Information Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering (University of Florence); Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale). The potentiality of the Research Center and some of its aims are explained through three empirical case studies.","authors":["Gabriele Arcidiacono","Rossella Berni","Nicola Bonora","M.
