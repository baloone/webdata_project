{"id":"324869376_Doing_being_an_ordinary_technology_and_social_media_user","abstract":"This paper uses discourse and conversation analysis of naturally-occuring conversations to describe how participants construct themselves as “ordinary” users of communication technologies—devices such as mobile phones, their communicative affordances, and the mediated interaction they enable (e.g., access to online communication via social media platforms). The three practices analyzed are (1) managing motivations by downplaying interest and stake in using technology and participating in online activities; (2) calibrating quantities of one's time and involvement using social media; (3) identifying investments in social media use through categories and identities that position users as appropriate or inappropriate. These techniques comprise an accounting practice that accomplishes identity construction in service of situated social actions to manage the moral implications of communication technology use.","authors":["Jessica Sarah Robles","Stephen Didomenico","Joshua Raclaw"],"meta":["May 2018Language & Communication 60:150-167","DOI:10.1016/j.langcom.2018.03.002","Project: mobile devices in face-to-face interaction"],"references":["309398589_Respecifying_Mediated_Interaction","281482716_Selfies_Image_and_the_Re-making_of_the_Body","273298548_Race_gender_and_self-presentation_in_teen_chat_profiles","317145479_Time_Reference_in_the_Service_of_Social_Action","308669606_Providing_Epistemic_Support_For_Assessments_Through_Mobile-Supported_Sharing_Activities","306943410_Learning_in_Public_Faculty_and_Student_Opinions_About_Social_Media_in_the_Classroom","289374634_Beyond_the_Power_of_Networks_Differentiating_Network_Structure_from_Social_Media_Affordances_for_Perceived_Social_Support","284224165_Mediated_Pedestrian_Mobility_Walking_and_the_Map_App"]}
