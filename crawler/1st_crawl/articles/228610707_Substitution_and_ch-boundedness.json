{"id":"228610707_Substitution_and_ch-boundedness","abstract":"A class G of graphs is said to be χ-bounded if there is a function f : N ∪ {0} → R such that for all G ∈ G and all induced subgraphs H of G, χ(H) ≤ f (ω(H)). In this paper, we show that if G is a χ-bounded class, then so is the closure of G under any one of the following three operations: substitution, gluing along a clique, and gluing along a bounded number of vertices. Furthermore, if G is χ-bounded by a polynomial (respectively: exponential) function, then the closure of G under substitution is also χ-bounded by some polynomial (respectively: exponential) function. In addition, we show that if G is a χ-bounded class, then the closure of G under the operations of gluing along a clique and gluing along a bounded number of vertices together is also χ-bounded, as is the closure of G under the operations of substitution and gluing along a clique together.","authors":["Maria Chudnovsky","Irena Penev","Alex Scott","Nicolas Trotignon"],"meta":["April 2011Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 103(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2013.02.004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228847649_Decomposition_of_even-hole-free_graphs_with_star_cutsets_and_2-joins","28135867_The_Strong_Perfect_Graph_Theorem","302205970_Sur_le_coloriage_des_graphs","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","266002367_Graphen_mit_triangulierbaren_ungeraden_Vielecken","262256044_The_Ramsey_number_R3_t_has_order_of_Magnitude_t2log_t","256935872_Induced_Cycles_and_Chromatic_Number","256157629_Induced_subtrees_in_graphs_of_large_chromatic_number","243778792_Sur_les_Coloriage_des_Graphs","243775964_Topics_on_Perfect_Graphs","243739651_Polynomial_Algorithm_to_Recognize_a_Meyniel_Graph","242910830_Induced_Trees_in_Graphs_of_Large_Chromatic_Number","242910791_Subgraphs_of_large_connectivity_and_chromatic_number_in_graphs_of_large_chromatic_number","241080529_Graphs_of_separability_at_most_2","229657111_Radius_two_trees_specify_ch-bounded_classes","226398640_Bull-free_Berge_graphs_are_perfect","225410295_K4-e-free_perfect_graphs_and_star_cutsets","222948566_Normal_Hypergraphs_and_the_Perfect_Graph_Conjecture","222822045_Even_pairs_in_Berge_graphs","222801325_A_note_on_Ramsey_numbers","222140070_Star-cutset_and_perfect_graphs","221942860_Composition_for_perfect_graphs","220569332_Decomposition_of_odd-hole-free_graphs_by_double_star_cutsets_and_2-joins","220533123_Radius_Three_Trees_in_Graphs_with_Large_Chromatic_Number"]}
