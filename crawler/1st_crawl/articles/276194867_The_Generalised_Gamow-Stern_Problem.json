{"id":"276194867_The_Generalised_Gamow-Stern_Problem","abstract":"This problem refers to an observation made by George Gamow and Marvin Stern [1]. They found that concerning multi-storey buildings whenever one requires the lift on a particular floor, the probability of the lift coming from above or below varies according to the height of the floor concerned. It was observed that on the second floor of a seven-storey building, the probability of the lift coming from below is very small whereas it is much greater when the sixth floor is concerned. This is very similar to the case of finding the probability of a bus coming from a particular direction at a stop on a bus route.","authors":["Subhranil De","Abhijit Sen"],"meta":["July 1996The Mathematical Gazette 80(488):345","DOI:10.2307/3619568"],"references":[]}
