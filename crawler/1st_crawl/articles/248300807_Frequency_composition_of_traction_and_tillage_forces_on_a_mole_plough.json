{"id":"248300807_Frequency_composition_of_traction_and_tillage_forces_on_a_mole_plough","abstract":"Field experiments were carried out in order to quantify the variations of the traction and tillage forces on a mole plough, in the case of four clayey soils of Eastern France. The same tractor-implement system, the same forward working speed (1 m s−1) and the same length of ploughing (20 m) were used. Specially designed strain gauge transducers applied to the system delivered a signal which was numerised and analysed in terms of power spectral density (PSD) function. The frequency composition of the traction and tillage forces consisted of interactions between soil and tool as well as vibrations of the tractor-implement system. Low frequencies (0–2 Hz range) were related to the random property of soil rupture and heterogeneity, whereas random vibration frequencies of the system were shown in the higher frequency range (2–15 Hz). The dominant distance of soil fracture was close to the working depth. The frequency analysis of interaction forces represented a combination of the influence of the soil, the mole plough and the operating conditions, so this method should provide a way to assess the performance of working parts and mole channel stability.","authors":["J.
