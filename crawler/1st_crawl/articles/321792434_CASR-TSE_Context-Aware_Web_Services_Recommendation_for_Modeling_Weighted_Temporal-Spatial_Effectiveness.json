{"id":"321792434_CASR-TSE_Context-Aware_Web_Services_Recommendation_for_Modeling_Weighted_Temporal-Spatial_Effectiveness","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed the growing research interest in the Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS). Specifically, CARS for Web service provides opportunities for exploring the important role of temporal and spatial contexts, separately. Although many CARS approaches have been investigated in recent years, they do not fully address the potential of temporal-spatial correlations in order to make personalized recommendation. In this paper, the Context-Aware Services Recommendation based on Temporal-Spatial Effectiveness (named CASR-TSE) method is proposed. We first model the effectiveness of spatial correlations between the user's location and the service's location on user preference expansion before the similarity computation. Second, we present an enhanced temporal decay model incorporating the weighted rating effect to improve the prediction accuracy in similarity computation. Finally, we evaluate the CASR-TSE method on a real-world Web services dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, and thus it is much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for personalized Web service recommendation.","authors":["Xiaoliang Fan","Yakun Hu","Zibin Zheng","Yujie Wang"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Services Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSC.2017.2782793","Project: Spatio-Temporal Data Mining"],"references":["308953917_Amazon_com_recommendations_Item-to-item_collaborative_filtering","308673316_A_Collaborative_Filtering_Method_for_Personalized_Preference-Based_Service_Recommendation","308672622_Service_Recommendation_for_Mashup_Creation_Based_on_Time-Aware_Collaborative_Domain_Regression","308672081_BiNet_Trust_Sub-network_Extraction_Using_Binary_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_in_Contextual_Social_Networks","308671933_Location-Based_Web_Service_QoS_Prediction_via_Preference_Propagation_for_Improving_Cold_Start_Problem","308671670_Web_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_Time_Series_Forecasting_and_Collaborative_Filtering","308671334_Personal_Preference_and_Trade-Off_Based_Additive_Manufacturing_Web_Service_Selection","308671143_QoS_Prediction_of_Web_Services_Based_on_Two-Phase_K-Means_Clustering","308671060_Supporting_End-User_Service_Composition_A_Systematic_Review_of_Current_Activities_and_Tools","301412876_Incorporating_Invocation_Time_in_Predicting_Web_Service_QoS_via_Triadic_Factorization"]}
