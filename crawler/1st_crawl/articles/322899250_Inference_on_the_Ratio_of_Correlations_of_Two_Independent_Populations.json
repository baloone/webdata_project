{"id":"322899250_Inference_on_the_Ratio_of_Correlations_of_Two_Independent_Populations","abstract":"The asymptotic distribution for the ratio of the sample correlations in two independent populations is established. The presented method can be used to derive the asymptotic confidence interval and hypothesis testing for the ratio of population correlations. The performance of the new interval is comparable with similar method. Then the simulation study is provided to compare our confidence interval with Fisher Z-transform and Cauchy-transform methods. The proposed confidence set has a good coverage probability with a larger power.","authors":["Razzagh Mahmoudi","Marzieh Mahmoudi"],"meta":["January 2013"],"references":["243766151_On_the_'Probable_Error'_of_a_Coefficient_of_Correlation_Deduced_From_a_Small_Sample","239059228_A_Course_in_Large_Sample_Theory","232595192_Comparing_Correlated_but_Nonoverlapping_Correlations","232571871_Comparing_Correlated_Correlation_Coefficients","15086717_SAS_program_for_testing_the_difference_between_two_correlated_correlation_coefficients","10737693_A_Monte_Carlo_Evaluation_of_Tests_for_Comparing_Dependent_Correlations","6842402_Comparing_correlations_of_continuous_observations_from_two_independent_populations_using_a_sequential_approach","5534650_Comparing_Dependent_Correlations"]}
