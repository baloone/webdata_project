{"id":"340469247_Number-Theoretic_Characterizations_of_Some_Restricted_CliffordT_Circuits","abstract":"Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca proved in 2012 that a 2Ã—2 unitary matrix V can be exactly represented by a single-qubit Clifford+ T circuit if and only if the entries of V belong to the ring Z[1/2,i] . Later that year, Giles and Selinger showed that the same restriction applies to matrices that can be exactly represented by a multi-qubit Clifford+ T circuit. These number-theoretic characterizations shed new light upon the structure of Clifford+ T circuits and led to remarkable developments in the field of quantum compiling. In the present paper, we provide number-theoretic characterizations for certain restricted Clifford+ T circuits by considering unitary matrices over subrings of Z[1/2,i] . We focus on the subrings Z[1/2] , Z[1/2] , Z[1/i2] , and Z[1/2,i] , and we prove that unitary matrices with entries in these rings correspond to circuits over well-known universal gate sets. In each case, the desired gate set is obtained by extending the set of classical reversible gates {X,CX,CCX} with an analogue of the Hadamard gate and an optional phase gate.","authors":["Matthew Amy","Andrew Glaudell","Neil J.
