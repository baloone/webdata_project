{"id":"200086154_A_SOA-based_architecture_framework","abstract":"We present an Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)â based architecture framework. The architecture framework is designed to be close to industry standards, especially to the Service Component Architecture (SCA). The framework is language independent and the building blocks of each system, activities and data, are first class citizens. We present a meta model of the architecture framework and discuss its concepts in detail. Through the framework, concepts of an SOA such as wiring, correlation and instantiation can be clarified.","authors":["Wil Van der Aalst","Wil M.
