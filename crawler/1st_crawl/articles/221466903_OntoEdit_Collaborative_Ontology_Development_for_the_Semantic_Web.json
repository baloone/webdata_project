{"id":"221466903_OntoEdit_Collaborative_Ontology_Development_for_the_Semantic_Web","abstract":"Ontologies now play an important role for enabling the semantic web. They provide a source of precisely defined terms e.g. for knowledge-intensive applications. The terms are used for concise communication across people and applications. Typically the development of ontologies involves collaborative ef- forts of multiple persons. OntoEdit is an ontology editor that integrates numerous aspects of ontology engineering. This paper focuses on collaborative development of ontologies with OntoEdit which is guided by a comprehensive methodology.","authors":["York Sure-Vetter","Michael Erdmann","JÃ¼rgen Angele","Steffen Staab"],"meta":["June 2002Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2342:221-235","DOI:10.1007/3-540-48005-6_18","SourceDBLP","Conference: The Semantic Web - ISWC 2002, First International Semantic Web Conference, Sardinia, Italy, June 9-12, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["243619379_Toward_Distributed_Use_of_Large-Scale_Ontologies_t","239060754_OntoPlugins_-_a_flexible_component_framework","235705607_Knowledge_Engineering_and_Management_-_The_CommonKADS_Methodology","319393397_Towards_a_Methodology_for_Building_Ontologies","314801114_WebODE_a_scalable_workbench_for_ontological_engineering","313312543_A_Tool_to_Support_Living_Ontologies","296815751_The_knowledge_model_of_Protege-2000_Combining_interoperability_and_flexibility","243763303_APECKS_a_Tool_to_Support_Living_Ontologies","238651027_A_Collaborative_Tool_for_Ontology_Construction","222866008_WonderTools_A_comparative_study_of_ontological_engineering_tools"]}
