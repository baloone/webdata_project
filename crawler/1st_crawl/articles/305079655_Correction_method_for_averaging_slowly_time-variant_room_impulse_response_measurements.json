{"id":"305079655_Correction_method_for_averaging_slowly_time-variant_room_impulse_response_measurements","abstract":"Various methods exist for room acoustic measurements. To increase the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), averaging of repeated room impulse responses (RIR) can be performed under the assumption of time-invariant systems. Associated with a study of the Paris Notre Dame cathedral, time-variances due to minute temperature changes were observed which confounded results of averaged RIRs, producing significantly shorter reverberation times. A correction method for such time-variance of the acoustic system is proposed, based on time-stretching. Following correction, reverberation times of averaged RIRs were comparable to expected tolerance ranges for measurements, well within one just noticeable difference, while also exhibiting a mid-frequency SNR gain of 8 dB.","authors":["Bart Postma","Brian F G Katz"],"meta":["July 2016The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 140(1):EL38-EL43","DOI:10.1121/1.4955006"],"references":["242154654_ACCEPTABLE_TEMPERATURE_CHANGES_DURING_SYNCHRONOUS_AVERAGING_FOR_REVERBERATION_TIME_MEASURING_BY_SWEPT-SINE_METHOD","237300511_INFLUENCE_OF_TIME-VARIANCE_IN_AUDITORIUM_ON_IMPULSE_RESPONSE_MEASUREMENT","236150508_Acoustics_An_Introduction_to_Its_Physical_Principles_and_Applications","2456363_Simultaneous_Measurement_of_Impulse_Response_and_Distortion_With_a_Swept-Sine_Technique","236213230_International_Round_Robin_on_Room_Acoustical_Impulse_Response_Analysis_Software_2004","233670874_Uncertainties_of_Measurements_in_Room_Acoustics"]}
