{"id":"267689222_A_Context_Information_Ontology_Hierarchy_Model_for_Tourism-oriented_Mobile_E-commerce","abstract":"with the development of e-commerce, it has become a study focus as how to get mobile service timely and accurately, as well as how to realize the context information management of users. In this paper, it takes mobile tourism for example to classify and describe context information firstly,then extract scene features to construct a quality restriction system and eventually build up a self-guided ontology-based mobile information management model for the context. It also cites West Lake Self-help guide as an example to verify the validity of above model in this paper.","authors":["Bei Wang","Dongsheng Liu","Szemin Wong"],"meta":["August 2012Journal of Software 7(8)","DOI:10.4304/jsw.7.8.1751-1758"],"references":["277293502_Categorization_and_Modelling_of_Quality_in_Context_Information","222305044_Knowledge_engineering_principles_and_methods_Data_Knowl_Eng_251-2161-197","220116275_Personalization_and_Context_Management","220056698_A_Context-Aware_Tour_Guide_User_Implications","27470289_Modeling_Context_Information_In_Pervasive_Computing_Systems","289242453_Context_modeling_for_business_collaboration","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","242935494_A_Survey_of_Context-Aware_Computing_and_Its_System_Infrastructure","239481421_ConteXtML_Exchanging_Contextual_Information_between_a_Mobile_Client_and_the_FieldNote_Server","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","223111693_Approximation_of_fuzzy_concepts_in_decision_making","221037188_Ontology_Based_Context_Modeling_and_Reasoning_using_OWL","3884672_Satisfactory_optimization_control_in_fuzzy_dynamic_environment_for_complex_systems","2668498_Rough_Sets_Rough_Relations_and_Rough_Functions"]}
