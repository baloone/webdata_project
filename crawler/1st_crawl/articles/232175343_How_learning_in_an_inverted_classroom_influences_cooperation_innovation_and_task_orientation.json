{"id":"232175343_How_learning_in_an_inverted_classroom_influences_cooperation_innovation_and_task_orientation","abstract":"Recent technological developments have given rise to blended learning\nclassrooms. An inverted (or flipped) classroom is a specific type of blended learning design\nthat uses technology to move lectures outside the classroom and uses learning activities to\nmove practice with concepts inside the classroom. This article compares the learning\nenvironments of an inverted introductory statistics class with a traditional introductory\nstatistics class at the same university. This mixed-methods research study used the College\nand University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), field notes, interviews and\nfocus groups to investigate the learning environments of these two classrooms. Students in\nthe inverted classroom were less satisfied with how the classroom structure oriented them\nto the learning tasks in the course, but they became more open to cooperative learning and\ninnovative teaching methods. These findings are discussed in terms of how they contribute\nto the stability and connectedness of classroom learning communities.","authors":["Jeremy Strayer"],"meta":["July 2012Learning Environments Research 15(2):171-193","DOI:10.1007/s10984-012-9108-4","Project: Implementing Teaching Practices with the Flipped Classroom"],"references":["248962937_Development_of_an_instrument_for_assessing_classroom_psychosocial_environment_at_universities_and_colleges","236517696_Structure_and_design_of_an_intelligent_tutorial_system_based_on_skill_assignments","227450483_Inverting_the_Classroom_A_Gateway_to_Creating_an_Inclusive_Learning_Environment","226387858_Influence_of_Redesigning_a_Learning_Environment_on_Student_Perceptions_and_Learning_Strategies","225819360_Evaluating_Web-supported_Learning_Versus_Lecture-based_Teaching_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Perspectives","222863721_Blended_Learning_Uncovering_Its_Transformative_Potential_in_Higher_Education","222822123_Research_Focus_and_Methodological_Choices_in_Studies_Into_Students'_Experiences_of_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education","222415109_Quality_in_blended_learning_Exploring_the_relationships_between_on-line_and_face-to-face_teaching_and_learning","221554491_Using_the_inverted_classroom_to_teach_software_engineering","4042325_The_assessment_of_knowledge_in_theory_and_in_practice","308926748_Designing_Qualitative_Research","303170761_The_classroom_flip_Using_Web_course_management_tools_to_become_the_guide_on_the_side","299860054_Higher_Education","262410728_The_Assessment_of_Knowledge_in_Theory_and_in_Practice","249735409_Randomized_Design_and_the_Myth_of_Certain_Knowledge_Guinea_Pig_Narratives_and_Cultural_Critique","247779996_The_Art_of_Fieldwork","247344972_Stochastic_Learning_Paths_in_a_Knowledge_Structure","245424844_Anthropological_Research_The_Structure_of_Inquiry","241011251_Learning_Environments_and_Learning_Styles_Nontraditional_Student_Enrollment_and_Success_in_an_Internet-based_Versus_a_Lecture-based_Computer_Science_Course","234021423_Grounded_Theory_Objectivist_and_Constructivist_Methods","233897035_Evaluating_Educational_Environments","233477948_Building_on_Learner_Contributions_A_Web-Supported_Pedagogic_Strategy","227222090_Classroom_Environment_Instruments_Development_Validity_and_Applications","226094420_An_invasion_in_the_classroom_Influence_of_an_ill-structured_innovation_on_instructional_and_epistemological_beliefs","223938273_Harmonizing_technology_with_interaction_in_blended_problem-based_learning","222704873_Student_perceptions_of_collaborative_learning_social_presence_and_satisfaction_in_a_blended_learning_environment_Relationships_and_critical_factors","221931879_Designing_Qualitative_Research","220689058_Knowledge_Spaces","201382074_The_Evaluation_of_Qualitative_Research_Methods","44831842_Qualitative_Research_And_Evaluation_Methods","44828585_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Techniques_And_Procedures_For_Developing_Grounded_Theory","38183922_Students'_perceptions_of_a_blended_web-based_learning_environment","31697899_Interviewing_As_Qualitative_Research_A_Guide_for_Researchers_in_Education_and_the_Social_Sciences","10764082_Social_Contexts_Transcending_Their_Power_and_Their_Fragility"]}
