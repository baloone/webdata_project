{"id":"284579161_Longest_Gapped_Repeats_and_Palindromes","abstract":"A gapped repeat (respectively, palindrome) occurring in a word $w$ is a\nfactor $uvu$ (respectively, $u^Rvu$) of $w$. In such a repeat (palindrome) $u$\nis called the arm of the repeat (respectively, palindrome), while $v$ is called\nthe gap. We show how to compute efficiently, for every position $i$ of the word\n$w$, the longest gapped repeat and palindrome occurring at that position,\nprovided that the length of the gap is subject to various types of\nrestrictions. That is, that for each position $i$ we compute the longest prefix\n$u$ of $w[i..n]$ such that $uv$ (respectively, $u^Rv$) is a suffix of\n$w[1..i-1]$ (defining thus a gapped repeat $uvu$ - respectively, palindrome\n$u^Rvu$), and the length of $v$ is subject to the aforementioned restrictions.","authors":["Marius Dumitran","Pawel Gawrychowski","Florin Manea"],"meta":["November 2015Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_16","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["282403230_Efficiently_Finding_All_Maximal_alpha-gapped_Repeats","257048186_Computing_the_Longest_Previous_Factor","256606518_Searching_of_Gapped_Repeats_and_Subrepetitions_in_a_Word","319394814_Algorithms_on_strings_trees_and_sequences_computer_science_and_computational_biology","313101772_Efficient_algorithms_for_two_extensions_of_LPF_table_The_power_of_suffix_arrays","300569498_Longest_alpha_a_-Gapped_Repeat_and_Palindrome","287843716_Finding_pseudo-repetitions","286031356_Testing_generalised_freeness_of_words","281486611_Optimal_searching_of_gapped_repeats_in_a_word","257907962_Efficient_Data_Structures_for_the_Factor_Periodicity_Problem"]}
