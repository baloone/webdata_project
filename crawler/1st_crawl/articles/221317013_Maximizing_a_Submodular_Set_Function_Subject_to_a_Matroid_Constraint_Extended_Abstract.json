{"id":"221317013_Maximizing_a_Submodular_Set_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint_Extended_Abstract","abstract":"Let \\(f:2^{N} \\rightarrow \\cal R^{+}\\) be a non-decreasing submodular set function, and let \\((N,\\cal I)\\) be a matroid. We consider the problem \\(\\max_{S \\in \\cal I} f(S)\\). It is known that the greedy algorithm yields a 1/2-approximation [9] for this problem. It is also known, via a reduction from the max-k-cover problem, that there is no (1 − 1/e + ε)-approximation for any constant ε> 0, unless P = NP [6]. In this paper, we improve the 1/2-approximation to a (1 − 1/e)-approximation, when f is a sum of weighted rank functions of matroids. This class of functions captures a number of interesting problems including set coverage type problems. Our main tools are the pipage rounding technique of Ageev and Sviridenko [1] and a probabilistic lemma on monotone submodular functions that might be of independent interest.\n\nWe show that the generalized assignment problem (GAP) is a special case of our problem; although the reduction requires |N| to be exponential in the original problem size, we are able to interpret the recent (1 − 1/e)-approximation for GAP by Fleischer et al. [10] in our framework. This enables us to obtain a (1 − 1/e)-approximation for variants of GAP with more complex constraints.","authors":["Gruia Calinescu","Chandra Chekuri","Martin Pál","Jan Vondrák"],"meta":["June 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-72792-7_15","SourceDBLP","Conference: Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, 12th International IPCO Conference, Ithaca, NY, USA, June 25-27, 2007, Proceedings"],"references":["242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","227444614_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","227143989_On_the_complexity_of_approximating_k-Set_Packing","221437489_On_the_Complexity_of_Approximating_k-Dimensional_Matching","304425177_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","288951549_An_analysis_of_the_greedy_algorithm_for_the_submodular_set_covering_problem","267061247_The_efficacy_of_the_greedy_algorithm","242929727_Maximising_Real-Valued_Submodular_Functions_Primal_and_Dual_Heuristics_for_Location_Problems","239665630_An_Analysis_of_the_Greedy_Heuristic_for_Independence_Systems","239534896_A_threshold_of_In_n_for_approximating_set_cover","226715030_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","225983337_Wolsey_LA_An_analysis_of_the_greedy_algorithm_for_submodular_set_covering_problem_Combinatorica_24_385-393","224678314_Approximation_algorithms_for_allocation_problems_Improving_the_factor_of_1_-_1e","221462795_Maximum_Coverage_Problem_with_Group_Budget_Constraints_and_Applications","220779129_Tight_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_General_Assignment_Problems","220617718_A_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Multiple_Knapsack_Problem","220431158_Dependent_rounding_and_its_applications_to_approximation_algorithms","4186660_A_recursive_greedy_algorithm_for_walks_in_directed_graphs","3921102_Distributions_on_level-sets_with_applications_to_approximation_algorithms","2399993_A_PTAS_for_the_multiple_knapsack_problem","2323065_A_Threshold_of_Ln_N_for_Approximating_Set_Cover"]}
