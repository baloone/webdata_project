To meet this growing challenge, the research community of knowledge discovery from databases emerged. The key issue studied by this community is, in layman's terms, to make advantageous use of large stores of data. In order to make raw data useful, it is necessary to represent, process, and extract knowledge for various applications. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining offers an overview of the methods developed since the 1970's and provides a general framework in order to examine these methods and categorize them. This book employs simple examples to show the essence of representative feature selection methods and compares them using data sets with combinations of intrinsic properties according to the objective of feature selection. In addition, the book suggests guidelines for how to use different methods under various circumstances and points out new challenges in this exciting area of research. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining is intended to be used by researchers in machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and databases as a toolbox of relevant tools that help in solving large real-world problems. This book is also intended to serve as a reference book or secondary text for courses on machine learning, data mining, and databases.","authors":["Huan Liu","Hiroshi Motoda"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-5689-3","ISBN: 978-1-4613-7604-0"],"references":[]}
