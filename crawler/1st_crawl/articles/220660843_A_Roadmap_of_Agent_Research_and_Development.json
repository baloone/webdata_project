{"id":"220660843_A_Roadmap_of_Agent_Research_and_Development","abstract":"This paper provides an overview of research and development activities in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It aims to identify key concepts and applications, and to indicate how they relate to one-another. Some historical context to the field of agent-based computing is given, and contemporary research directions are presented. Finally, a range of open issues and future challenges are highlighted.","authors":["Nicholas R.
