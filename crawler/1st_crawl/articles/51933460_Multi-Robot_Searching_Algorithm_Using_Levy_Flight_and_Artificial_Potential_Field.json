{"id":"51933460_Multi-Robot_Searching_Algorithm_Using_Levy_Flight_and_Artificial_Potential_Field","abstract":"An efficient search algorithm is very crucial in robotic area, especially for\nexploration missions, where the target availability is unknown and the\ncondition of the environment is highly unpredictable. In a very large\nenvironment, it is not sufficient to scan an area or volume by a single robot,\nmultiple robots should be involved to perform the collective exploration. In\nthis paper, we propose to combine bio-inspired search algorithm called Levy\nflight and artificial potential field method to perform an efficient searching\nalgorithm for multi-robot applications. The main focus of this work is not only\nto prove the concept or to measure the efficiency of the algorithm by\nexperiments, but also to develop an appropriate generic framework to be\nimplemented both in simulation and on real robotic platforms. Several\nexperiments, which compare different search algorithms, are also performed.","authors":["Donny Sutantyo","Serge Kernbach","Valentin Nepomnyashchikh","Paul Levi"],"meta":["August 2011","DOI:10.1109/SSRR.2010.5981560","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255649979_A_MACROSCOPIC_PROBABILISTIC_MODEL_OF_ADAPTIVE_FORAGING_IN_SWARM_ROBOTICS_SYSTEMS","230943498_Simulations_of_Levy_flights","224749557_Potential_Field_Methods_and_Their_Inherent_Limitations_for_Mobile_Robot_Navigation","224623567_Minimalistic_Approach_towards_Communication_and_Perception_in_Microrobotic_Swarms","224557518_Multi-robot_coordination_using_generalized_social_potential_fields","224472128_Evolutionary_Robotics_The_Next-Generation-Platform_for_On-line_and_On-board_Artificial_Evolution","222818057_Multi-robot_exploration_under_the_constraints_of_wireless_networking","244501397_Simulation_of_biological_evolution_and_machine_learning_Journal_of_Theoretical_Biology_17_319","234115720_Structural_Self-organization_in_Multi-Agents_and_Multi-Robotic_Systems","222694080_Levy_flights_in_random_searches"]}
