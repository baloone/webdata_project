{"id":"325287775_Hadamard_matrices_orthogonal_designs_and_clifford-gastineau-hills_algebras","abstract":"Research into the construction of Hadamard matrices and orthogonal designs has led to deeper algebraic and combinatorial concepts. This paper surveys the place of amicability, repeat designs and the Clifford and Clifford-Gastineau-Hills algebras in laying the foundations for a Theory of Orthogonal Designs.","authors":["Jennifer Seberry"],"meta":["January 2018Australasian Journal of Combinatorics 71(3):452-467"],"references":[]}
