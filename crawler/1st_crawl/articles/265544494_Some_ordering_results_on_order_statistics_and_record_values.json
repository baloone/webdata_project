{"id":"265544494_Some_ordering_results_on_order_statistics_and_record_values","abstract":"Let X i:j denote the ith order statistic of a random sample of size j from a continuous life distribution F. We compare the failure rates r i:n and r j:m of X i:n and X j:m , respectively. We obtain some relationships among failure rates of order statistics from samples of possibly different sizes. Further, we explore similar relationships of the failure rates of upper record values. Finally, we present practical applications of our results.","authors":["Mohammad Z. Raqab","Wael A.
