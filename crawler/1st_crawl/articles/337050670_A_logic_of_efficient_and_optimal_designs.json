{"id":"337050670_A_logic_of_efficient_and_optimal_designs","abstract":"Logics of design have been formulated until recently to offer systematic treatments of the way systems express the relation between resources, processes and their outputs. We present a logic of systems design which explicitly formalizes this relation as a decidable checking problem on resource access and define computable efficiency and optimality properties.","authors":["Giuseppe Primiero"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Logic and Computation","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exz014","Project: Philosophy of Computer Science"],"references":["317972531_The_Logic_of_Design_as_a_Conceptual_Logic_of_Information","278025495_Realist_Consequence_Epistemic_Inference_Computational_Correctness","268332734_On_Malfunctioning_Software","222472605_On_the_logic_of_design","221558042_Designs_Disputes_and_Strategies","331931258_The_Logic_of_Design_as_a_Conceptual_Logic_of_Information","285438096_The_Logic_of_Design_and_the_Question_of_Value","265812121_Labelled_calculi_of_resources","256399598_A_note_on_the_logic_of_design","222811434_Towards_a_formal_logic_of_design_rationalization","220695420_Strong_Normalization_in_a_Typed_Lambda_Calculus_with_Lambda_Structured_Types","220694801_Types_and_Programming_Languages","220693866_Requirements_Engineering_Fundamentals_Principles_and_Techniques","38327286_From_Foundations_to_Ludics"]}
