{"id":"321356130_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_teachers'_training_a_workshop_review","abstract":"In recent years, several visual programming languages and tools are emerging, which allow young students to easily program applications. Particularly, the block-based language used by Scratch has been the standard in most school initiatives to introduce Computational thinking (CT) in courses unrelated to computing. However, CT competences are not specifically included in the curricula of many Higher Education degrees that future teachers of Primary and Secondary Education have to complete. This paper describes a workshop for teachers' training on CT. It is based on the block-based common language of Scratch, but focused on enhancing teachers' skills to develop mobile applications with a tool based on the MIT's AppInventor. This workshop provided some insights on the capabilities of future teachers in the use of programming tools1.","authors":["Juan Manuel Dodero","José Miguel Mota Macias","Iván Ruiz-Rube"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1145/3144826.3145352","Conference: the 5th International Conference","Project: VISAIGLE"],"references":["308880760_What_Computational_Thinking_Is","302909013_Code_to_learn_with_Scratch_A_systematic_literature_review","281714025_Dr_Scratch_Automatic_Analysis_of_Scratch_Projects_to_Assess_and_Foster_Computational_Thinking","269393492_Perspectives_on_and_theories_of_learing_with_digital_technologies","311506504_A_survey_of_resources_for_introducing_coding_into_schools","310809036_A_brief_introduction_to_TACCLE_3_-_coding_European_project","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","308846015_Starting_from_scratch_Developing_a_pre-service_teacher_training_program_in_computational_thinking","290506345_CS4HS","266653457_CS4Impact_measuring_computational_thinking_concepts_present_in_CS4HS_participant_lesson_plans"]}
