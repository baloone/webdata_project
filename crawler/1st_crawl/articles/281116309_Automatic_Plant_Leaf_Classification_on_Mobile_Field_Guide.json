{"id":"281116309_Automatic_Plant_Leaf_Classification_on_Mobile_Field_Guide","abstract":"Various plant species are available on earth but it is very difficult to identify the plant and its usage. The plant can verify by extracting the feature of leaves. The digital image processing is necessary used tool for the feature extraction and to get the pattern of studied images. There are several techniques are available to perform such task but it is very difficult to find such method that gives accurate and efficient result. To resolve this problem, our project aim is to present the application which is used for classification of the plant on a Smartphone. Leaf is classify based on its extracted feature is called as plant leaf classification. The techniques used for classification of leaf are k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy logic. The goal of this project is to provide fastest application which gives accuracy. SQLite is an Open Source Database which is embedded into Android. SQLite supports standard relational database features like SQL syntax, transactions and prepared statements.","authors":["Snehal Shejwal","Prachi Nikale","Ashwini Datir","Ashvini Kadus"],"meta":["January 2015"],"references":[]}
