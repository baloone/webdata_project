{"id":"3921088_Improved_inapproximability_results_for_MaxClique_chromatic_number_and_approximate_graph_coloring","abstract":"The author presents improved inapproximability results for three problems: the problem of finding the maximum clique size in a graph, the problem of finding the chromatic number of a graph, and the problem of coloring a graph with a small chromatic number with a small number of colors. J. Hastad's (1996) result shows that the maximum clique size in a graph with n vertices is inapproximable in polynomial time within a factor n<sup>1-&epsi;</sup> or arbitrarily small constant &epsi;>0 unless NP=ZPP. We aim at getting the best subconstant value of &epsi; in Hastad's result. We prove that clique size is inapproximable within a factor n/2((log n))<sup>1-y</sup> corresponding to &epsi;=1/(log n)<sup>γ</sup> for some constant γ>0 unless NP⊆ZPTIME(2((log n))<sup>O(1)</sup>). This improves the previous best inapproximability factor of n/2<sup>O(log n</sup>√log log n)/ (corresponding to &epsi;=O(1/√log log n)) due to L. Engebretsen and J. Holmerin (2000). A similar result is obtained for the problem of approximating chromatic number of a graph. We also present a new hardness result for approximate graph coloring. We show that for all sufficiently large constants k, it is NP-hard to color a k-colorable graph with k<sup>1</sup>25 (log k)/ colors. This improves a result of M. Furer (1995) that for arbitrarily small constant &epsi;>0, for sufficiently large constants k, it is hard to color a k-colorable graph with k<sup>3</sup>2-&epsi;/ colors.","authors":["S.
