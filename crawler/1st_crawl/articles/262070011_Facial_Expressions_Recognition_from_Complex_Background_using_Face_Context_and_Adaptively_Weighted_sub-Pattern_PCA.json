{"id":"262070011_Facial_Expressions_Recognition_from_Complex_Background_using_Face_Context_and_Adaptively_Weighted_sub-Pattern_PCA","abstract":"A new approach for facial expressions recognition\nbased on face context and adaptively weighted sub-pattern PCA (Aw-\nSpPCA) has been presented in this paper. The facial region and\nothers part of the body have been segmented from the complex\nenvironment based on skin color model. An algorithm has been\nproposed to accurate detection of face region from the segmented\nimage based on constant ratio of height and width of face (Î´= 1.618).\nThe paper also discusses on new concept to detect the eye and mouth\nposition. The desired part of the face has been cropped to analysis the\nexpression of a person. Unlike PCA based on a whole image pattern,\nAw-SpPCA operates directly on its sub patterns partitioned from an\noriginal whole pattern and separately extracts features from them.\nAw-SpPCA can adaptively compute the contributions of each part\nand a classification task in order to enhance the robustness to both\nexpression and illumination variations. Experiments on single\nstandard face with five types of facial expression database shows that\nthe proposed method is competitive.","authors":["Md.
