{"id":"330948353_Mechanism_of_Solvent_Control_of_Protein_Dynamics","abstract":"We find that the coupled interactions between protein and water polarization fluctuations play a dominant role in driving the configuration space random walk of solvated proteins. We perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on five proteins. Owing to a very low dielectric constant of protein, its dipolar groups experience forces from water along with local forces due to protein atoms. Energy fluctuations reveal a pronounced anticorrelation between protein and water contributions. The protein energy spectrum shows bimodal 1/f noise, which can be attributed to the influence of water on the dynamics of protein.","authors":["Saumyak Mukherjee","Sayantan Mondal","Biman Bagchi"],"meta":["February 2019Physical Review Letters 122(5)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.058101"],"references":["324848065_Butane_dihedral_angle_dynamics_in_water_is_dominated_by_internal_friction","320427236_Origin_of_diverse_time_scales_in_the_protein_hydration_layer_solvation_dynamics_A_simulation_study","320236661_Protein_Hydration_Dynamics_Much_Ado_about_Nothing","318357075_Distinguishing_dynamical_features_of_water_inside_protein_hydration_layer_Distribution_reveals_what_is_hidden_behind_the_average","317738562_Hidden_electrostatic_basis_of_dynamic_allostery_in_a_PDZ_domain","287996327_Canonical_Dynamics_Equilibrium_Phase-Space_Distributions","319524073_LINCS_A_linear_constraint_solver_for_molecular_simulations","317408779_Water_is_an_active_matrix_of_life_for_cell_and_molecular_biology","316784748_Decomposition_of_total_solvation_energy_into_core_side-chains_and_water_contributions_Role_of_cross_correlations_and_protein_conformational_fluctuations_in_dynamics_of_hydration_layer","302909938_Importance_of_Atomic_Contacts_in_Vibrational_Energy_Flow_in_Proteins"]}
