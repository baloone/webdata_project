{"id":"327727540_Semantically_Aware_Urban_3D_Reconstruction_with_Plane-Based_Regularization","abstract":"We propose a method for urban 3D reconstruction, which incorporates semantic information and plane priors within the reconstruction process in order to generate visually appealing 3D models.\nWe introduce a plane detection algorithm using 3D lines, which detects a more\ncomplete and less spurious plane set compared to point-based methods\nin urban environments. Further, the proposed normalized visibility-based\nenergy formulation eases the combination of several energy terms within\na tetrahedra occupancy labeling algorithm and, hence, is well suited for\ncombining it with class specific smoothness terms. As a result, we produce visually appealing and detailed building models (i.e., straight edges\nand planar surfaces) and a smooth reconstruction of the surroundings.","authors":["Thomas Holzmann","Michael Maurer","Friedrich Fraundorfer","Horst Bischof"],"meta":["September 2018","Conference: European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)At: Munich","Project: Urban 3D Reconstruction"],"references":["332810932_Semantic_3D_Reconstruction_with_Finite_Element_Bases","319412527_AUTOMATED_INSPECTION_OF_POWER_LINE_CORRIDORS_TO_MEASURE_VEGETATION_UNDERCUT_USING_UAV-BASED_IMAGES","318726301_PolyFit_Polygonal_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","318695239_De-noising_stabilizing_and_completing_3D_reconstructions_on-the-go_using_plane_priors","311611435_Large-Scale_Semantic_3D_Reconstruction_An_Adaptive_Multi-resolution_Model_for_Multi-class_Volumetric_Labeling","308278130_Manhattan-World_Urban_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","304409176_Conditional_Random_Fields_as_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","282927545_Real-Time_Direct_Dense_Matching_on_Fisheye_Images_Using_Plane-Sweeping_Stereo","276090364_SURE_Photogrammetric_Surface_Reconstruction_From_Imagery","275960895_RAPTER_Rebuilding_Man-made_Scenes_with_Regular_Arrangements_of_Planes","264318369_Surface_Reconstruction_through_Point_Set_Structuring","261857418_Incremental_Surface_Extraction_from_Sparse_Structure-from-Motion_Point_Clouds","261448707_Joint_3D_Scene_Reconstruction_and_Class_Segmentation","228982296_eTRIMS_Image_Database_for_interpreting_images_of_man-made_scenes","223969595_A_Hybrid_Multi-View_Stereo_Algorithm_for_Modeling_Urban_Scenes","220183962_GlobFit_Consistently_Fitting_Primitives_by_Discovering_Global_Relations","44683582_Accurate_Dense_and_Robust_Multiview_Stereopsis","2417323_Surface_Simplification_Using_Quadric_Error_Metrics","320016839_Plane-based_Surface_Regularization_for_Urban_3D_Reconstruction","309282486_Regularized_3D_Modeling_from_Noisy_Building_Reconstructions","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","299496829_Efficient_3D_Scene_Abstraction_Using_Line_Segments","279830555_Planar_Shape_Detection_and_Regularization_in_Tandem","243773059_Efficient_Approximate_Energy_Minimization_via_Graph_Cuts","224135135_Hierarchical_shape-based_surface_reconstruction_for_dense_multi-view_stereo","221316529_Screened_Poisson_Surface_Reconstruction","221303863_Fusion_of_Feature-_and_Area-Based_Information_for_Urban_Buildings_Modeling_from_Aerial_Imagery","220505939_Efficient_RANSAC_for_point-cloud_shape_detection","4301686_Efficient_Multi-View_Reconstruction_of_Large-Scale_Scenes_using_Interest_Points_Delaunay_Triangulation_and_Graph_Cuts"]}
