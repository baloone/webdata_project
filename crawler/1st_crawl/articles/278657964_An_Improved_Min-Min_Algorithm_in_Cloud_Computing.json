{"id":"278657964_An_Improved_Min-Min_Algorithm_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Scheduling of user tasks is a very complicated process in cloud computing environment. Min-min algorithm shortcoming is the long tasks may not be scheduled. Therefore, this paper puts forward an improved min-min algorithm that not only based on the min-min algorithm but also the three constraints. The three constraints are quality of service, the dynamic priority model and the cost of service. By using the software CloudSim to run the simulation experiment. Compared with the traditional min-min algorithm, the experimental results show it can make long tasks execute at reasonable time, increase resource utilization rate and meet usersâ€™ requirements.","authors":["Gang Liu","Jing Li","Jianchao Xu"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33030-8_8","In book: Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference of Modern Computer Science and Applications (pp.47-52)"],"references":["258651945_Improved_Max-Min_Algorithm_in_Cloud_Computing","225928388_QoS_guided_Min-Min_heuristic_for_Grid_task_scheduling","220406092_Divisible_Load_Theory_A_New_Paradigm_for_Load_Scheduling_in_Distributed_Systems","24164535_CloudSim_A_Novel_Framework_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Cloud_Computing_Infrastructures_and_Services","222510982_A_Comparison_of_Eleven_Static_Heuristics_for_Mapping_a_Class_of_Independent_Tasks_onto_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Computing_Systems","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility","2422874_SimJava_A_discrete_event_simulation_library_for_Java"]}
