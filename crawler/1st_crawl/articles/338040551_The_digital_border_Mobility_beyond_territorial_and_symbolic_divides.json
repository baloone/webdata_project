{"id":"338040551_The_digital_border_Mobility_beyond_territorial_and_symbolic_divides","abstract":"In this article, we develop a definition of the digital border as an assemblage of mediations that articulates digital and other technologies with symbolic resources to draw boundaries of inside/outside both on the ground (territorial border) and in narrative (symbolic border). We subsequently sketch the contours of this assemblage through an emphasis on its dynamics of mediation, its dialectics of resistance and its trajectories of historicity and argue for the significance of this conceptualisation of the digital border in migration research.","authors":["Lilie Chouliaraki","Myria Georgiou"],"meta":["December 2019European Journal of Communication 34(6):594-605","DOI:10.1177/0267323119886147"],"references":["325763556_Press_Coverage_of_the_Refugee_and_Migrant_Crisis_in_the_EU_A_Content_Analysis_of_Five_European_Countries","324020686_Five_Questions_for_Digital_Migration_Studies_Learning_From_Digital_Connectivity_and_Forced_Migration_Into_Europe","323913682_The_Best_the_Worst_and_the_Hardest_to_Find_How_People_Mobiles_and_Social_Media_Connect_Migrants_Into_Europe","323912764_On_Digital_Passages_and_Borders_Refugees_and_the_New_Infrastructure_for_Movement_and_Control","315597701_Smartphone_travelling_understanding_the_use_and_impact_of_mobile_technology_on_irregular_migration_journeys","315516610_Victims_and_Villains_Migrant_Voices_in_the_British_Media","313745962_Finding_a_voice_through_humanitarian_technologies_Communication_technologies_and_participation_in_disaster_recovery","312015518_Smartphone_travelling_understanding_the_use_and_impact_of_mobile_technology_on_irregular_migration_journeys","310416833_Mapping_Refugee_Media_Journeys_Smartphones_and_Social_Media_Networks","286523202_Mobile_Commons_andin_Precarious_Spaces_Mapping_Migrant_Struggles_and_Social_Resistance","273526479_Border_surveillance_mobility_management_and_the_shaping_of_non-publics_in_Europe","263346451_Border_work_Surveillant_assemblages_virtual_fences_and_tactical_counter-media","232903769_Lines_in_the_Sand_Towards_an_Agenda_for_Critical_Border_Studies","228196451_Europe's_New_Technological_Gatekeeper_Debating_the_Deployment_of_Technology_in_Migration_Policy","345427566_Migration_solidarity_and_the_limits_of_Europe","334237899_City_of_Refuge_or_Digital_Order_Refugee_Recognition_and_the_Digital_Governmentality_of_Migration_in_the_City","332545982_No_Go_World_How_Fear_Is_Redrawing_Our_Maps_and_Infecting_Our_Politics","330932354_Gamers_versus_zombies_Visual_mediation_of_the_citizennon-citizen_encounter_in_Europe's_'refugee_crisis'","330803768_Forces_and_Forms","326320668_Canadian_media_coverage_of_the_Syrian_refugee_crisis_Representation_response_and_resettlement","322449980_Does_the_subaltern_speak_Migrant_voices_in_digital_Europe","320434821_Refugee_'crisis'_Try_'crisis_in_the_European_press'","320039792_Voice_and_community_in_the_2015_refugee_crisis_A_content_analysis_of_news_coverage_in_eight_European_countries","317250364_The_Representation_of_the_European_Refugee_Crisis_in_Italy_Domopolitics_Securitization_and_Humanitarian_Communication_in_Political_and_Media_Discourses","316532151_Hospitability_The_Communicative_Architecture_of_Humanitarian_Securitization_at_Europe's_Borders_Hospitability","308831451_Mare_Nostrum_the_visual_politics_of_a_military-humanitarian_operation_in_the_Mediterranean_Sea","289751782_X-the_problem_of_the_Negro_as_a_problem_for_thought","286243934_The_Materiality_of_Communism_Politics_beyond_Representation_and_the_State","283336241_Migrant_Urbanisms_Ordinary_Cities_and_Everyday_Resistance","279287990_The_Emergence_of_iBorder_Bordering_Bodies_Networks_and_Machines","277482197_Borders_on_the_Mind_Re-Framing_Border_Thinking","249426026_Speechless_Emissaries_Refugees_Humanitarianism_and_Dehistoricization","229068411_Sorting_Things_Out_Classification_and_Its_Consequences","200820479_Redrawing_the_Line_Borders_and_Security_in_the_Twenty-First_Century","200457003_Television_And_Everyday_Life"]}
