{"id":"330143670_Epistemic_Entitlements_and_the_Practice_of_Computer_Simulation","abstract":"What does it mean to trust the results of a computer simulation? This paper argues that trust in simulations should be grounded in empirical evidence, good engineering practice, and established theoretical principles. Without these constraints, computer simulation risks becoming little more than speculation. We argue against two prominent positions in the epistemology of computer simulation and defend a conservative view that emphasizes the difference between the norms governing scientific investigation and those governing ordinary epistemic practices.","authors":["John Symons","Ram√≥n Alvarado"],"meta":["March 2019Minds and Machines 29(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11023-018-9487-0"],"references":["331271297_Understanding_Error_Rates_in_Software_Engineering_Conceptual_Empirical_and_Experimental_Approaches","316885458_The_Epistemic_Superiority_of_Experiment_to_Simulation","346678208_Extending_Ourselves","344114241_Reconstructing_Reality_Models_Mathematics_and_Simulations","342876776_Advancing_Knowledge_Through_Computer_Simulations_A_Socratic_Exercise","322928489_Big_Data_Thick_Mediation_and_Representational_Opacity","321146318_Outlines_of_a_Pragmatic_Theory_of_Truth_and_Error_in_Computer_Simulation","320640000_AI_and_the_Automation_of_Wisdom","316168579_Science_and_Art_of_Simulation_I_Exploring_-_Understanding_-_Knowing","315869599_Understanding_Social_Science_Simulations_Distinguishing_Two_Categories_of_Simulations","307619789_Can_we_trust_Big_Data_Applying_philosophy_of_science_to_software","315867994_Advancing_Knowledge_Through_Computer_Simulations_A_Socratic_Exercise","312465725_Beyond_the_Ivory_Tower_The_Scientific_Consensus_on_Climate_Change","300896817_Computer_Simulations_A_New_Mode_of_Scientific_Inquiry","299895834_On_Epistemic_Alchemy"]}
