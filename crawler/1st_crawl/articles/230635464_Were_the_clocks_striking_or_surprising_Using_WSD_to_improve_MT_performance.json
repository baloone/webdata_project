{"id":"230635464_Were_the_clocks_striking_or_surprising_Using_WSD_to_improve_MT_performance","abstract":"We report on a series of experiments aimed at improving the machine translation of ambiguous lexical items by using wordnet-based unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and comparing its results to three MT systems. Our experiments are performed for the English-Slovene language pair using UKB, a freely available graph-based word sense disambiguation system. Results are evaluated in three ways: a manual evaluation of WSD performance from MT perspective, an analysis of agreement between the WSD-proposed equivalent and those suggested by the three systems, and finally by computing BLEU, NIST and METEOR scores for all translation versions. Our results show that WSD performs with a MT-relevant precision of 71% and that 21% of sense-related MT errors could be prevented by using unsupervised WSD.","authors":["Špela Vintar","Darja Fiser","Aljoša Vrščaj"],"meta":["April 2012","Conference: EACL-HYTRA"],"references":["242567080_Improving_Machine_Translation_Using_Hybrid_Dictionary-Graph_Based_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_with_Semantic_and_Statistical_Methods","231747577_Introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_evaluating_word_sense_disambiguation_systems","226888880_Leveraging_Parallel_Corpora_and_Existing_Wordnets_for_Automatic_Construction_of_the_Slovene_Wordnet","220947007_Personalizing_PageRank_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","220817117_Word-Sense_Disambiguation_for_Machine_Translation","269953350_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","234805461_Building_a_large_ontology_for_machine_translation","221419469_Target_Word_Selection_Using_WordNet_and_Data-Driven_Models_in_Machine_Translation","221013209_Improving_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","220873543_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Improves_Statistical_Machine_Translation"]}
