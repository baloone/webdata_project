{"id":"330203258_Long_short-term_memory_networks_in_memristor_crossbar_arrays","abstract":"Deep neural networks are increasingly popular in data-intensive applications, but are power-hungry. New types of computer chips that are suited to the task of deep learning, such as memristor arrays where data handling and computing take place within the same unit, are required. A well-used deep learning model called long short-term memory, which can handle temporal sequential data analysis, is now implemented in a memristor crossbar array, promising an energy-efficient and low-footprint deep learning platform.","authors":["Can Li","Zhongrui Wang","Mingyi Rao","Daniel Belkin"],"meta":["January 2019Nature Machine Intelligence 1(1)","DOI:10.1038/s42256-018-0001-4"],"references":["327805720_The_Microsoft_2017_Conversational_Speech_Recognition_System","325855817_Efficient_and_self-adaptive_in-situ_learning_in_multilayer_memristor_neural_networks","325605113_Equivalent-accuracy_accelerated_neural-network_training_using_analogue_memory","325240303_Chipmunk_A_systolically_scalable_09_mm_2_308GopsmW_12_mW_accelerator_for_near-sensor_recurrent_neural_network_inference","324571573_Scaling_for_edge_inference_of_deep_neural_networks","324444981_Mixed-precision_in-memory_computing","324275373_Approximate_FPGA-Based_LSTMs_Under_Computation_Time_Constraints","324163524_A_memristor-based_long_short_term_memory_circuit","322642718_SiGe_epitaxial_memory_for_neuromorphic_computing_with_reproducible_high_performance_based_on_engineered_dislocations","324589274_Nonvolatile_Memory_Materials_for_Neuromorphic_Intelligent_Machines","321791910_Reservoir_computing_using_dynamic_memristors_for_temporal_information_processing","321492168_Analogue_signal_and_image_processing_with_large_memristor_crossbars","321124573_Chipmunk_A_Systolically_Scalable_09_mm2_308_GopsmW_12_mW_Accelerator_for_Near-Sensor_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Inference","320662592_Learning_to_detect_violent_videos_using_convolutional_long_short-term_memory","322375977_Memristor-Based_Analog_Computation_and_Neural_Network_Classification_with_a_Dot_Product_Engine"]}
