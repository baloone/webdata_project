{"id":"316856422_Argumentation_Ranking_Semantics_based_on_Propagation","abstract":"Argumentation is based on the exchange and the evaluation of interacting arguments. Unlike Dung's theory where arguments are either accepted or rejected, ranking-based semantics rank-order arguments from the most to the least acceptable ones. We propose in this work six new ranking-based semantics. We argue that, contrarily to existing ranking semantics in the literature, that focus on evaluating attacks and defenses only, it is reasonable to give a prominent role to non-attacked arguments, as it is the case in standard Dung's semantics. Our six semantics are based on the propagation of the weight of each argument to its neighbors, where the weight of non-attacked arguments is greater than the attacked ones.","authors":["Elise Bonzon","Jérôme Delobelle","Sébastien Konieczny","Nicolas Maudet"],"meta":["January 2016","Project: AMANDE - Advanced Multilateral Argumentation for DEliberation"],"references":["263163610_Argument_Ranking_with_Categoriser_Function","220814892_Social_Abstract_Argumentation","220543246_Graduality_in_Argumentation","299689900_Ranking-Based_Semantics_for_Argumentation_Frameworks","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","222543439_A_Logic-Based_Theory_of_Deductive_Arguments","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1","221176705_On_the_Issue_of_Reinstatement_in_Argumentation","221176555_A_Game-Theoretic_Measure_of_Argument_Strength_for_Abstract_Argumentation"]}
