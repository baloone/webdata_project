{"id":"269411702_An_unsupervised_text_classification_method_using_Kohonen's_Self_Organizing_Networks","abstract":"A text classification method using Kohonen's self organizing network is presented here. The proposed method can classify a set of text documents into a number of classes, dependingon their contents where the number of such classes is not known a priori. Necessary morphological analysis to extract the root words from the given set of texts is carried out to form the pattern vector for classification. Text documents from various faculties of games are considered for experimentation. The method has been found to provide satisfactory results for large size data.","authors":["Nirmalya Chowdhury"],"meta":["December 2007"],"references":[]}
