{"id":"355379720_An_Efficient_Modified_AZPRP_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_for_Large-Scale_Unconstrained_Optimization_Problem","abstract":"To find a solution of unconstrained optimization problems, we normally use a conjugate gradient (CG) method since it does not cost memory or storage of second derivative like Newton’s method or Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method. Recently, a new modification of Polak and Ribiere method was proposed with new restart condition to give a so-call AZPRP method. In this paper, we propose a new modification of AZPRP CG method to solve large-scale unconstrained optimization problems based on a modification of restart condition. The new parameter satisfies the descent property and the global convergence analysis with the strong Wolfe-Powell line search. The numerical results prove that the new CG method is strongly aggressive compared with CG_Descent method. The comparisons are made under a set of more than 140 standard functions from the CUTEst library. The comparison includes number of iterations and CPU time.","authors":["Ahmad Alhawarat","Thoi Trung Nguyen","Ramadan Sabra","Zabidin Salleh"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Mathematics 2021","DOI:10.1155/2021/6692024"],"references":["335899109_A_conjugate_gradient_algorithm_and_its_application_in_large-scale_optimization_problems_and_image_restoration","314241783_Modification_of_Nonlinear_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_with_Weak_Wolfe-Powell_Line_Search","311732515_An_efficient_modified_Polak-Ribiere-Polyak_conjugate_gradient_method_with_global_convergence_properties","344125424_A_family_of_three-term_conjugate_gradient_methods_with_sufficient_descent_property_for_unconstrained_optimization","338869833_The_PRP_conjugate_gradient_algorithm_with_a_modified_WWP_line_search_and_its_application_in_the_image_restoration_problems","313181074_Functional_minimization_by_conjugate_gradients","268020656_The_Limited_Memory_Conjugate_Gradient_Method","262348079_A_descent_family_of_Dai-Liao_conjugate_gradient_methods","257942431_Broyden's_Quasi-Newton_Methods_for_a_Nonlinear_System_of_Equations_and_Unconstrained_Optimization_a_Review_and_Open_Problems","246965155_Nonconvex_minimization_calculations_and_the_conjugate_gradient_method"]}
