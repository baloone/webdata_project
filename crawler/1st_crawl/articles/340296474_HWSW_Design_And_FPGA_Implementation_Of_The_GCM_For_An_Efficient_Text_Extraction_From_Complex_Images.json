{"id":"340296474_HWSW_Design_And_FPGA_Implementation_Of_The_GCM_For_An_Efficient_Text_Extraction_From_Complex_Images","abstract":"The Gamma Correction Method GCM is used as an important task in the text extraction process. In this paper, we propose a co-design implementation of the GCM using an FPGA board. This HW/SW implementation uses VHDL and C language to build a real embedded system validation. The implementation methodology performs an optimized run time of the GCM for text extraction in complex images. Our experiments are based on an FPGA HW/SW board. The obtained results showed that the proposed method can help to improve the performance of the GCM for text extraction by using the NiosII processor and hardware custom instructions. The proposed architecture enables to gain of 35% of the run time.","authors":["Anis Boudabous","Ben Atitallah Mohamed Amin","Rostom Kachouri","Ahmed Ben Atitallah"],"meta":["March 2020"],"references":["289713118_Automatic_text_extraction_from_complex_colored_images_using_gamma_correction_method","271468273_Fuzzy_rule-based_image_exposure_level_estimation_and_adaptive_gamma_correction_for_contrast_enhancement_in_dark_images"]}
