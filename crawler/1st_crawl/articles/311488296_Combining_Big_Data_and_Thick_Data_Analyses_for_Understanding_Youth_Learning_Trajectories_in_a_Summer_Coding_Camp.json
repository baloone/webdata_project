{"id":"311488296_Combining_Big_Data_and_Thick_Data_Analyses_for_Understanding_Youth_Learning_Trajectories_in_a_Summer_Coding_Camp","abstract":"In this paper we explore how to assess novice youths' learning of programming in an open-ended, project-based learning environment. Our goal is to combine analysis of frequent, automated snapshots of programming (e.g., \"big\" data) within the \"thick\" social context of kids? learning for deeper insights into their programming trajectories. This paper focuses on the first stage of this endeavor: the development of exploratory quantitative measures of youths? learning of computer science concepts. Analyses focus on kids? learning in a series of three Scratch Camps where 64 campers aged 10-13 used Scratch 2.0 to make a series of creative projects over 30 hours in five days. In the discussion we consider the highlights of the insights-and blind spots-of each data source with regard to youths' learning.","authors":["Deborah A.
