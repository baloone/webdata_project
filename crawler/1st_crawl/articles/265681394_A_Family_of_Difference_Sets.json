{"id":"265681394_A_Family_of_Difference_Sets","abstract":"A difference set ( , D ) is defined in (2) as a subset D of k elements in a group of order υ with the following properties :\n(1) if x ∊ , x ≠ 1, there are exactly λ distinct ordered pairs ( d 1 d 2 ) of elements of D such that x = 1 d 2 ;\n(2) if x ∊ , x ≠ 1, there are exactly λ distinct ordered pairs ( 3 d 4 ) of elements of D such that x = 3 d 4 −1.","authors":["R.G.
