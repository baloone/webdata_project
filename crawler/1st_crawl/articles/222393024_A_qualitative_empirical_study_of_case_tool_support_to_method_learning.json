{"id":"222393024_A_qualitative_empirical_study_of_case_tool_support_to_method_learning","abstract":"The appropriate time for introducing and using CASE tools in software engineering education and training is a matter of debate. Some argue in favor of early introduction with the aim of enforcing standardization and enhancing method learning. Others argue that CASE tool introduction should be postponed until a reasonable level of competence has been reached. This article discusses the relevance of CASE tools in the process of learning a software development method. The discussion is based on empirical results from a study that was conducted in a university setting.","authors":["Lars Bo Eriksen","Jan Stage"],"meta":["July 1998Information and Software Technology 40(5-6):339-345","DOI:10.1016/S0950-5849(98)00062-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242533207_Breakdowns_and_processes_during_the_early_activities_of_software_design_by_professionals","243778884_CASE_Tool_Bootstrapping_-_How_Little_Strokes_Fell_Great_Oaks","238746127_Case_is_software_automation","234810090_Computer-aided_software_engineering_Present_status_and_future_directions","234800487_CASE_Tools_and_the_IS_workplace_Some_findings_form_empirical_research","220919519_Modelling_Events_in_Object-Oriented_Analysis","220695893_Object-Oriented_Modeling_And_Design","220691208_Managing_Software_Process","220690704_Computer-aided_software_engineering_-_the_methodologies_the_products_and_the_future","220588388_CASE_Planning_and_the_Software_Process","220419863_Evaluating_of_Vendor_Products_CASE_Tools_as_Methodology_Companions","30873047_Object_Oriented_Software_Construction","3591240_Will_CASE_help_me_develop_more_reliable_software"]}
