{"id":"232620521_Knowledge_Representation_with_Ontologies_The_Present_and_Future","abstract":"Recently, there?s been an explosion of interest in ontologies as artifacts to represent human knowledge and as critical components in knowledge management, the Semantic Web, business-to-business applications, and several other application areas. Various research communities commonly assume that ontologies are the appropriate modeling structure for representing knowledge. However, little discussion has occurred regarding the actual range of knowledge an ontology can successfully represent. This installment of Trends and Controversies brings together several practitioners to debate this issue.","authors":["Christopher Brewster","Kieron O'Hara","Steve Fuller","Yorick Wilks"],"meta":["January 2004Intelligent Systems, IEEE 19(1):72-81","DOI:10.1109/MIS.2004.1265889","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["284257068_Information_Technology_as_the_Key_to_the_Knowledge_Revolution","272933711_Sensemaking_in_Organizations","269915027_Scientific_Explanation_A_Study_of_the_Function_of_Theory_Probability_and_Law_in_Science","262323135_Connectionism_and_Cognitive_Architecture","247955517_The_Problem_of_Meaning_in_Linguistics","243614355_Recursive_Auto-Associative_Memory_Devising_Compositional_Distributed_Representations","239030327_Special_Issue_on_Problem_Solving_Methods","238982782_Wordnet_an_on-line_lexical_database_and_some_of_its_applications","238671873_Building_Large_Knowledge-Based_Systems_Representation_and_Inference_in_CYC","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies"]}
