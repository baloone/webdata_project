{"id":"321180500_A_systematic_framework_to_discover_pattern_for_web_spam_classification","abstract":"Web spam is a big problem for search engine users in World Wide Web. They use deceptive techniques to achieve high rankings. Although many researchers have presented the different approach for classification and web spam detection still it is an open issue in computer science. Analyzing and evaluating these websites can be an effective step for discovering and categorizing the features of these websites. There are several methods and algorithms for detecting those websites, such as decision tree algorithm. In this paper, we present a systematic framework based on CHAID algorithm and a modified string matching algorithm (KMP) for extract features and analysis of these websites. We evaluated our model and other methods with a dataset of Alexa Top 500 Global Sites and Bing search engine results in 500 queries.","authors":["Hamed Jelodar","Yongli Wang","Chi Yuan","Xiaohui Jiang"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["313450321_Towards_Web_Spam_Filtering_Using_a_Classifier_Based_on_the_Minimum_Description_Length_Principle","264086768_Link-based_web_spam_detection_using_weight_properties","256942175_A_generic_statistical_approach_for_spam_detection_in_Online_Social_Networks","256090110_Multilayer_Perceptrons_Neural_Network_based_Weh_Spam_Detection_Application","311489225_Identification_of_Web_Spam_through_Clustering_of_Website_Structures","308852756_Evaluation_and_Analysis_of_Popular_Decision_Tree_Algorithms_for_Annoying_Advertisement_Websites_Classification","301832196_Co-Detecting_Social_Spammers_and_Spam_Messages_in_Microblogging_via_Exploiting_Social_Contexts","282267216_A_dynamic_model_for_integrating_simple_web_spam_classification_techniques","271690135_An_Exploratory_Technique_for_Investigating_Large_Quantities_of_Categorical_Data","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment"]}
