{"id":"333643684_Needs_Analysis_of_Academic-English_Speaking_Material_in_Promoting_21_st_Century_Skills","abstract":"Needs analysis plays a vital role in developing speaking material and results in a powerful tool that helps teachers to design materials in line with the learners' target needs and learning needs. The aims of this research are to analyse the types of learners' target needs and learning needs for material development in the academic English-speaking course. This study surveyed 312 English department students from six universities in three Indonesian provinces. Questionnaire and in-depth interview were used in collecting data then those data were analysed by using a software program, namely an excel chart data series. Findings revealed that learners' target needs are necessities, lacks, and wants. Meanwhile, learning needs cover input, procedure, setting, and learner's role. The independent speaking task was necessitated by students (64,49%) and lack of vocabulary (32,69%). Moreover, communication & collaboration (39,10%) was students' wants towards course design whereas video was learning media input (38,46%). Discussion as procedure desired (37,50%), group work (37,82%) as a classroom setting, and active communicator (39,74%) as the learners' role. Students' wants strongly indicated that material design must be able to promote 21 st-century skills. Speaking practitioners are suggested to adapt their material based upon need analysis.","authors":["Sebastianus Menggo","I Made Suastra","Made Budiarsa","Ni Nyoman Padmadewi"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal of Instruction 12(2):739-754","DOI:10.29333/iji.2019.12247a"],"references":["322519867_Educating_for_twenty-first_century_competencies_and_future-ready_learners_research_perspectives_from_Singapore","321636438_Celebrating_Undergraduate_Students'_Research_at_York_University","320165326_Debate_Instruction_in_EFL_Classroom_Impacts_on_the_Critical_Thinking_and_Speaking_Skill","319782712_USING_NEEDS_ANALYSIS_TO_DEVELOP_ENGLISH_TEACHING_MATERIALS_IN_INITIAL_SPEAKING_SKILLS_FOR_INDONESIAN_COLLEGE_STUDENTS_OF_ENGLISH","318022101_Discovering_Students'_Preference_for_Classroom_Activities_and_Teachers'_Frequency_of_Activity_Use","317266530_Individual_accountability_in_cooperative_learning_More_opportunities_to_produce_spoken_English","316639901_Improving_Speaking_Fluency_in_a_Task-Based_Language_Teaching_Approach_The_Case_of_EFL_Learners_at_PUNIV-Cazenga","315790125_TECHNOLOGY_IN_TEACHING_SPEAKING_SKILL","320569290_Developing_Oral_Communication_Skills_through_Collaborative_Learning_Implications_for_Nigerian_Teachers","316429442_Collaborative_and_Self-directed_Learning_Strategies_to_Promote_Fluent_EFL_Speakers","313423477_The_Effectiveness_of_Immersive_Multimedia_Learning_with_Peer_Support_on_English_Speaking_and_Reading_Aloud","303528323_Teaching_for_Creativity_Development_Lessons_Learned_from_a_Preliminary_Study_of_Vietnamese_and_International_Upper_High_Secondary_School_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Lesson_Plans","299507876_Communication_Skills_for_the_21st_Century_Engineer","305341034_Curricular_Elements_for_Learner_Success-21st_Century_Skills","299356634_The_importance_of_vocabulary_in_language_learning_and_how_to_be_taught"]}
