{"id":"332857177_Predicting_Ion_Channels_Genes_and_Their_Types_With_Machine_Learning_Techniques","abstract":"Motivation: The number of ion channels is increasing rapidly. As many of them are associated with diseases, they are the targets of more than 700 drugs. The discovery of new ion channels is facilitated by computational methods that predict ion channels and their types from protein sequences.\nMethods: We used the SVMProt and the k-skip-n-gram methods to extract the feature vectors of ion channels, and obtained 188- and 400-dimensional features, respectively. The 188- and 400-dimensional features were combined to obtain 588-dimensional features. We then employed the maximum-relevance-maximum-distance method to reduce the dimensions of the 588-dimensional features. Finally, the support vector machine and random forest methods were used to build the prediction models to evaluate the classification effect.\nResults: Different methods were employed to extract various feature vectors, and after effective dimensionality reduction, different classifiers were used to classify the ion channels. We extracted the ion channel data from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt, http://www.uniprot.org/) and Ligand-Gated Ion Channel databases (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/LGICdb/LGICdb.php), and then verified the performance of the classifiers after screening. The findings of this study could inform the research and development of drugs.","authors":["Ke Han","Miao Wang","Lei Zhang","Ying Wang"],"meta":["May 2019Frontiers in Genetics 10","DOI:10.3389/fgene.2019.00399"],"references":["328965624_Identify_origin_of_replication_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_using_two-step_feature_selection_technique","328662468_LncRNA2Target_v20_a_comprehensive_database_for_target_genes_of_lncRNAs_in_human_and_mouse","328175967_Comparative_analysis_and_prediction_of_quorum-sensing_peptides_using_feature_representation_learning_and_machine_learning_algorithms","328004906_Classifying_Included_and_Excluded_Exons_in_Exon_Skipping_Event_Using_Histone_Modifications","330667750_A_comprehensive_review_and_comparison_of_existing_computational_methods_for_intrinsically_disordered_protein_and_region_prediction","328993127_Identification_of_protein_subcellular_localization_via_integrating_evolutionary_and_physicochemical_information_into_Chou's_general_PseAAC","328933708_Gene2vec_Gene_Subsequence_Embedding_for_Prediction_of_Mammalian_N6-Methyladenosine_Sites_from_mRNA","328809699_HITS-PR-HHblits_protein_remote_homology_detection_by_combining_PageRank_and_Hyperlink-Induced_Topic_Search","328298186_Predicting_protein_structural_classes_for_low-similarity_sequences_by_evaluating_different_features","327868736_iTerm-PseKNC_a_sequence-based_tool_for_predicting_bacterial_transcriptional_terminators"]}
