{"id":"329256760_Full-Vector_Gradient_for_Multi-Spectral_or_Multivariate_Images","abstract":"Gradient extraction is important for a lot of metrological applications such as Control Quality by Vision. In this work, we propose a full-vector gradient for multi-spectral sensors. The full-vector gradient extends Di Zenzo expression to take into account the non-orthogonality of the acquisition channels thanks to a Gram matrix. This expression is generic and independent from channel count. Results are provided for a color and a multi-spectral snapshot sensor. Then, we show the accuracy improvement of the gradient calculation by creating a dedicated objective test and from real images.
