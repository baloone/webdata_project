{"id":"319770228_Convolutional_Pose_Machines","abstract":"Pose Machines provide a sequential prediction framework for learning rich implicit spatial models. In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets.","authors":["Shih-En Wei","Varun Ramakrishna","Takeo Kanade","Yaser Sheikh"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2016.511","Conference: CVPR"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","302826933_Monocular_3D_pose_estimation_and_tracking_by_detection","286662859_Multi-source_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","284476297_DeepCut_Joint_Subset_Partition_and_Labeling_for_Multi_Person_Pose_Estimation","280329483_Human_Pose_Estimation_with_Iterative_Error_Feedback","278048481_Flowing_ConvNets_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_in_Videos","269332682_2D_Human_Pose_Estimation_New_Benchmark_and_State_of_the_Art_Analysis","269332657_Human_Pose_Estimation_with_Fields_of_Parts","265908778_Deeply-Supervised_Nets","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","263048918_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","262176760_Strong_Appearance_and_Expressive_Spatial_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","221364433_Measure_Locally_Reason_Globally_Occlusion-sensitive_Articulated_Pose_Estimation","215616968_Understanding_the_difficulty_of_training_deep_feedforward_neural_networks","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","319769908_End-to-end_people_detection_in_crowded_scenes","312727767_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","312429903_Understanding_the_difficulty_of_training_deep_feed_forward_neural_networks","311610924_End-to-End_People_Detection_in_Crowded_Scenes","311610609_DeepCut_Joint_Subset_Partition_and_Labeling_for_Multi_Person_Pose_Estimation","307719713_Efficient_object_localization_using_Convolutional_Networks","303432735_Recurrent_convolutional_neural_networks_for_scene_labeling","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","289933059_Pose_Machines_Articulated_Pose_Estimation_via_Inference_Machines","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285008105_Gradient_Flow_in_Recurrent_Nets_The_Difficulty_of_Learning_LongTerm_Dependencies","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","263930062_Articulated_Pose_Estimation_by_a_Graphical_Model_with_Image_Dependent_Pairwise_Relations","262362593_Exploring_the_Spatial_Hierarchy_of_Mixture_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","262177406_Using_Linking_Features_in_Learning_Non-parametric_Part_Models","261276858_MODEC_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","261236793_Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors","261227384_Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures","259335300_DeepPose_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Deep_Neural_Networks","258055384_Articulated_Human_Detection_with_Flexible_Mixtures_of_Parts","235130690_Learning_in_Modular_Systems","225223935_Pictorial_Structures_for_Object_Recognition","224579272_Pictorial_structures_revisited_People_detection_and_articulated_pose_estimation","224254989_Articulated_pose_estimation_with_flexible_mixtures-of-parts","224254726_Learning_effective_human_pose_estimation_from_inaccurate_annotation","221364525_Learning_message-passing_inference_machines_for_structured_prediction","221363090_Monocular_3D_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking_by_Detection","221260179_Clustered_Pose_and_Nonlinear_Appearance_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","221111967_Articulated_part-based_model_for_joint_object_detection_and_pose_estimation","45721107_Auto-Context_and_Its_Application_to_High-Level_Vision_Tasks_and_3D_Brain_Image_Segmentation","4156170_Strike_a_pose_tracking_people_by_finding_stylized_poses"]}
