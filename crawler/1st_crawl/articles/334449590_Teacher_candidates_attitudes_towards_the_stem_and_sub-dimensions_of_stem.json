{"id":"334449590_Teacher_candidates_attitudes_towards_the_stem_and_sub-dimensions_of_stem","abstract":"The developments in science and technology have led to changes in the expectations of countries from the future and the individuals. In the 21st century, focusing on innovative approaches in the education system has become compulsory to raise individuals who question, find rapid and effective solutions to problems and who could think scientifically. One of these approaches is Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) training. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between STEM and STEM sub-dimensions. The study group consists of 204 teacher candidates from different departments of the Faculty of Education of Sakarya University during the academic year 2018/2019. To collect data, the attitude scale for STEM and the sub-dimensions of STEM were used in the study. One-way ANOVA was used in this correlation for parametric tests. According to the results of the study, there is a positive and significant relationship between STEM and all STEM sub-dimensions based on the data collected from teacher candidates.\n\nKeywords: STEM, sub-dimensions, teacher candidates.","authors":["Ezgi PELİN Yildiz","Ayşe Alkan","Metin Çengel"],"meta":["June 2019Cypriot Journal of Educational Sciences 14(2):322-344","DOI:10.18844/cjes.v14i2.4144"],"references":["331029915_The_effect_of_VR_and_traditional_videos_on_learner_retention_and_decision_making","328233579_To_stem_or_not_to_sTEM_That_is_not_the_question","322129010_Students'_Attitude_towards_STEM_Education","320953430_Creating_a_positive_learning_environment_for_adult","312243758_Ethical_Perception_of_Information_Technologies_at_Computer_Science_Faculties","287927807_5_Sinif_Ogrencilerinin_Bilimsel_Surec_Becerileri_ile_Fene_Karsi_Tutumlarina_FeTeMM_Etkinliklerinin_Etkisi","274694873_Fen_Bilgisi_Ogretmen_Adaylarinin_Muhendis_ve_Muhendislik_Algilarinin_ve_Yontem_Olarak_Muhendislik-Dizayna_Bakis_Acilarinin_Incelenmesi","330976073_IMPLEMENTATION_AND_INTEGRATION_OF_ENGINEERING_IN_K-12_STEM_EDUCATION_Synthesizing_Research_Policy_and_Practices","321483086_Communicative_language_in_the_virtual_world","302501657_Curriculum_Integration_Challenging_the_Assumption_of_School_Science_as_Powerful_Knowledge"]}
