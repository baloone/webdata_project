{"id":"315808795_Mental_imagery_and_creativity_A_meta-Analytic_review_study","abstract":"The reports of many creative individuals suggest the use of mental imagery in scientii c and artistic production. A variety of protocols have tested the association between mental imagery and creativity, but the individual differences approach has been most frequently employed. This approach is assessed here through a range of meta-analytic tests. Database searches revealed 18 papers employing the individual differences approach that were subjected to a conservative set of selection criteria. Nine studies (1,494 participants) were included in the nal analyses. A marginal, but statistically signii cant, Fisher's Z-transformed correlation coef cient was revealed. Further analyses showed little difference between form and type of self-reported imagery and divergent thinking. Explanations for the failure to account for more than 3% of the variance in the data sets are discussed in the context of anecdotal reports, task validity, and design problems.","authors":["Nicholas Leboutillier","David F Marks"],"meta":["March 2003British Journal of Psychology 94(Pt 1)","DOI:10.1348/000712603762842084","Project: Imagery, theory, method and practice"],"references":["320353407_Creativity","317671181_Before_the_Gates_of_Excellence_The_Determinants_of_Creative_Genius","314115047_Creative_cognition_Theory_research_and_applications","313768809_Patterns_of_creativity_and_mental_imagery_in_men_and_women","313759679_A_power_primer","302162462_Creativity_and_Perception","290454109_Meta-Analytic_Procedures_for_Social_Science_Research","289939558_A_Taxonomy_and_Critique_of_Measurements_Used_in_the_Study_of_Creativity","286784364_Synaesthesia_and_imagery_Fantasia_revisited","284661363_The_Nature_of_Creativity_Contemporary_Psychological_Perspectives"]}
