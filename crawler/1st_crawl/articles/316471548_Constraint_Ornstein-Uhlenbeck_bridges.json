{"id":"316471548_Constraint_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_bridges","abstract":"We study the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge process (i.e. the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process conditioned to start and end at fixed points) constraints to have a fixed area under its path. Both anticipative (in this case, knowledge of the future of the path is needed) and non-anticipative representations of the stochastic process are derived. The anticipative description is obtained thanks to the theory of generalized Gaussian bridges while the non-anticipative representation comes from the theory of stochastic control. For this last representation, a stochastic differential equation is derived which leads to an effective Langevin equation. Finally, we extend our theoretical findings to linear bridge processes.","authors":["Alain Mazzolo"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of Mathematical Physics 58(9)","DOI:10.1063/1.5000077"],"references":["281488545_The_critical_catastrophe_revisited","281115748_Inequivalence_of_nonequilibrium_path_ensembles_The_example_of_stochastic_bridges","266850443_Optimal_Steering_of_a_Linear_Stochastic_System_to_a_Final_Probability_Distribution_Part_II","264673851_Optimal_steering_of_a_linear_stochastic_system_to_a_final_probability_distribution","234063796_The_Essentials_of_Linear_State-Space_Systems","224959301_Generalized_Gaussian_Bridges","220084418_Properties_of_the_Reflected_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_Process","7291292_Spatial_survival_probability_for_one-dimensional_fluctuating_interfaces_in_the_steady_state","313893628_Periodic_Airy_process_and_equilibrium_dynamics_of_edge_fermions_in_a_trap","313332100_Constrained_Brownian_processes_and_constrained_Brownian_bridges","302581114_Optimal_Steering_of_a_Linear_Stochastic_System_to_a_Final_Probability_Distribution_Part_II","292074358_Modeling_interdependent_animal_movement_in_continuous_time","282554236_Pricing_American_options_when_there_is_short-lived_arbitrage","273388307_Effective_Langevin_equations_for_constrained_stochastic_processes","268761060_Conditional_Brownian_motion_and_the_boundary_limits_of_harmonic_functions","265358013_Zufallige_Bewegungen","263930265_Stochastic_Bridges_of_Linear_Systems","262489241_Nonequilibrium_Markov_Processes_Conditioned_on_Large_Deviations","227423316_Conditioned_stochastic_differential_equations_Theory_examples_and_application_to_finance","51104140_Generating_Transition_Paths_by_Langevin_Bridges","47646414_Sample_path_deviations_of_the_Wiener_and_the_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_process_from_its_bridges","47637691_Representations_of_multidimensional_linear_process_bridges","45914566_Area_distribution_and_the_average_shape_of_a_L'evy_bridge","22633127_The_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_process_as_a_model_for_neuronal_activity_-_I_Mean_and_variance_of_the_firing_time","5217273_Stock_Price_Distributions_With_Stochastic_Volatility_An_Analytic_Approach","1874340_Airy_Distribution_Function_From_the_Area_Under_a_Brownian_Excursion_to_the_Maximal_Height_of_Fluctuating_Interfaces","1846647_Brownian_Functionals_in_Physics_and_Computer_Science"]}
