{"id":"290524383_Research_and_development_of_fault_intelligent_diagnosis_based_on_models","abstract":"Model-based approach is one of the premier research direction for intelligent systems fault diagnosis. Various types of approaches have been used including fault models, causal models, structural models, behavioural models, and diagnostic inference models. This paper discusses, and thier associated inference mechanisms. Additionally hybrid approaches about model-based reasoning combined with case-based reasoning or fuzzy logic, or genetic algorithms, are investigated.","authors":["Y. Zhang","J. Yang","H. Jia","J.
