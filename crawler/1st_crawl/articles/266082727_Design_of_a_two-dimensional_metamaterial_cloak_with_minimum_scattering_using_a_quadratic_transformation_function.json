{"id":"266082727_Design_of_a_two-dimensional_metamaterial_cloak_with_minimum_scattering_using_a_quadratic_transformation_function","abstract":"The presence of extreme material properties and undesired scattering make practical implementation of transformation optics based cloaks an extremely challenging issue. To overcome these problems, a simplified quadratic cloak has been proposed which provides finite material properties at the inner radius of the cloak and impedance match with the free space at the outer radius of the cloak simultaneously. The simultaneous occurrence of finite material properties and impedance match with the free space at the respective boundaries reduces the scattering cross section significantly. The material properties of the proposed simplified quadratic cloak can be realized with two dimensional (2D) metamaterials. The performance of the proposed cloak is examined by plotting the normalized total scattering cross section (SCSt,norm), and the scattering patterns in azimuthal plane. The proposed simplified quadratic cloak shows 10 dB reduction of the scattered field in both the forward and backward directions with respect to the perfect electric conductor (PEC) cylinder.","authors":["Archana Rajput","Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava"],"meta":["September 2014Journal of Applied Physics 116(12):124501-124501-5","DOI:10.1063/1.4893480"],"references":["265602303_Ultrathin_Cylindrical_Cloak","235550265_Extending_the_bandwidth_of_electromagnetic_cloaks","234891954_Area-transformation_method_for_designing_invisible_cloaks","234883229_Microwave_transmission_through_a_two-dimensional_isotropic_left-handed_metamaterial","228551453_Electromagnetic_resonances_in_individual_and_coupled_split-ring_resonators","225024636_Experimental_Characterization_of_a_Broadband_Transmission-Line_Cloak_in_Free_Space","224443566_Application_of_coordinate_transformation_in_bent_waveguide","224406482_Experimental_characterization_and_cell_interactions_of_a_two-dimensional_isotropic_left-handed_metamaterial","45877928_A_class_of_line-transformed_cloaks_with_easily-realizable_constitutive_parameters","44853028_Transformational_plasmonics_Cloak_concentrator_and_rotator_for_SPPs","27235505_Nonmagnetic_cloak_with_minimized_scattering","26315501_Scattering_characteristics_of_simplified_cylindrical_invisibility_cloaks","5915666_Ideal_Cylindrical_Cloak_Perfect_but_Sensitive_to_Tiny_Perturbations","5619322_Cylindrical_Invisibility_Cloak_with_Simplified_Material_Parameters_is_Inherently_Visible","2178393_Chan_CT_Transformation_media_that_rotate_electromagnetic_fields_Appl_Phys_Lett_90_241105","1920778_Cylindrical_Cloak_with_Axial_PermittivityPermeability_Spatially_Invariant","248486621_Towards_invisible_glass","234883596_Effective_properties_of_split-ring_resonator_metamaterials_using_measured_scattering_parameters_Effect_of_gap_orientation","231148815_Transformation_optical_designs_for_wave_collimators_flat_lenses_and_right-angle_bends","231048236_The_effect_of_transformation_order_on_the_invisibility_performance_of_a_practical_cylindrical_cloak","224543195_A_rigorous_and_nonsingular_two_dimensional_cloaking_coordinate_transformation","224453965_Equivalent_circuit_model_for_left-handed_metamaterials","224133435_Impedance-matched_three-dimensional_beam_expander_and_compressor_designs_via_transformation_optics","222409465_Design_of_electromagnetic_cloaks_and_concentrators_using_form-invariant_coordinate_transformations_of_Maxwell's_equations","51422150_Transformation-optical_design_of_adaptive_beam_bends_and_beam_expanders","26294705_Calculation_of_material_properties_and_ray_tracing_in_transformation_media","23391250_Physics_Transforming_light","12040931_Shelby_R_A_Smith_D_R_Schultz_S_Experimental_verification_of_a_negative_index_of_refraction_Science_292_77-79","7053333_Pendry_J_B_Schurig_D_Smith_D_R_Controlling_electromagnetic_fields_Science_312_1780-1782","6768830_Full-wave_simulations_of_electromagnetic_cloaking_structures","6742938_Metamaterial_Electromagnetic_Cloak_at_Microwave_Frequencies","3007816_Reflection_properties_of_Salisbury_screen"]}
