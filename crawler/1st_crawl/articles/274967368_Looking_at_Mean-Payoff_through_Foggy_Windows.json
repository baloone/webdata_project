{"id":"274967368_Looking_at_Mean-Payoff_through_Foggy_Windows","abstract":"Mean-payoff games (MPGs) are infinite duration two-player zero-sum games\nplayed on weighted graphs. Under the hypothesis of perfect information, they\nadmit memoryless optimal strategies for both players and can be solved in\nNP-intersect-coNP. MPGs are suitable quantitative models for open reactive\nsystems. However, in this context the assumption of perfect information is not\nalways realistic. For the partial-observation case, the problem that asks if\nthe first player has an observation-based winning strategy that enforces a\ngiven threshold on the mean-payoff, is undecidable. In this paper, we study the\nwindow mean-payoff objectives that were introduced recently as an alternative\nto the classical mean-payoff objectives. We show that, in sharp contrast to the\nclassical mean-payoff objectives, some of the window mean-payoff objectives are\ndecidable in games with partial-observation.","authors":["Paul Hunter","Guillermo A.
