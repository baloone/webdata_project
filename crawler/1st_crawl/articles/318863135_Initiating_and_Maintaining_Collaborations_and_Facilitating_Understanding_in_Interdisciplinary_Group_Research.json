{"id":"318863135_Initiating_and_Maintaining_Collaborations_and_Facilitating_Understanding_in_Interdisciplinary_Group_Research","abstract":"In this article of the “Interdisciplinary Insights Into Group and Team Dynamics” special issue, we provide guidance for computer scientists and social scientists who seek an interdisciplinary approach to group research. We include how-to guidelines for researchers interested in initiating and maintaining collaborations, and discuss opportunities and pitfalls of interdisciplinary group research. Last, we include a brief case study that portrays some of the complications of creating shared understanding.","authors":["Stephenson J.
