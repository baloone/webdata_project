Since personality theory claims that a user's personality substantially influences preference, I propose a personality-based product recommender (PBPR) framework to analyze social media data in order to predict a user's personality and to subsequently derive its personality-based product preferences. The PBRS framework will be evaluated as an IT-artefact with a unique online social network XING dataset and a unique coffeemaker preference dataset. My evaluation results show (a) the possibility of predicting a user's personality from social media data, as I reached a predictive gain between 23.2 and 41.8 percent and (b) the possibility of recommending products based on a user's personality, as I reached a predictive gain of 45.1 percent.","authors":["Ricardo Buettner"],"meta":["August 2017Electronic Markets 27(3):247-265","DOI:10.1007/s12525-016-0228-z","Project: efficient Recruiting 2.0"],"references":["313610493_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_fmeasure_to_roc_informedness_markedness_and_correlation","311491342_A_pilot_study_of_cyber_security_and_privacy_related_behavior_and_personality_traits","308836667_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Crowdsourcing_Research_from_a_Human_Resource_Management_Perspective","344799678_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Twitter_Research_from_a_Socio-Political_Revolution_Perspective","329824898_Personality_and_Consumer_Behavior_A_Review","329052290_Consumer_Self-Concept_Symbolism_and_Market_Behavior_A_Theoretical_Approach","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","318392950_An_Introduction_to_Generalized_Linear_Models_Third_Edition","314603476_On_the_Use_of_Cross-Domain_User_Preferences_and_Personality_Traits_in_Collaborative_Filtering","313056740_Make_new_friends_or_keep_the_old_Gender_and_personality_differences_in_social_networking_use"]}
