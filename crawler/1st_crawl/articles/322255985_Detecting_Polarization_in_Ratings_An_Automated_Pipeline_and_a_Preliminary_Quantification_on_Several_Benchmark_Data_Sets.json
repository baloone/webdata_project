{"id":"322255985_Detecting_Polarization_in_Ratings_An_Automated_Pipeline_and_a_Preliminary_Quantification_on_Several_Benchmark_Data_Sets","abstract":"Personalized recommender systems are becoming increasingly relevant and important in the study of polarization and bias, given their widespread use in filtering information spaces. Polarization is a social phenomenon, with serious consequences, in real-life, particularly on social media. Thus it is important to understand how machine learning algorithms, especially recommender systems, behave in polarized environments.\nIn this paper, we study polarization within the context of the users’ interactions with a space of items and how this affects recommender systems. We first formalize the concept of polarization based on item ratings and then relate it to the item reviews to investigate any potential correlation. We then propose a domain independent data science pipeline to automatically detect polarization using the ratings rather than the typical properties used to detect polarization, such as item’s content or social network topology.\nWe perform an extensive comparison of polarization measures on several benchmark data sets and show that our polarization detection framework can detect different degrees of polarization and outperforms existing measures in capturing an intuitive notion of polarization. Our work is an essential step toward quantifying and detecting polarization in ongoing ratings and in benchmark data sets, and to this end, we use our developed polarization detection pipeline to compute the polarization prevalence of several benchmark data sets. It is our hope that this work will contribute to supporting future research in the emerging topic of designing and studying the behavior of recommender systems in polarized environments.","authors":["Mahsa Badami","Olfa Nasraoui","Wenlong Sun","Patrick Shafto"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1109/BigData.2017.8258231","Conference: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","Projects: Web Data MiningInformation RetrievalFair Machine Learning and Algorithmic BiasRecommender Systems"],"references":["313610493_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_fmeasure_to_roc_informedness_markedness_and_correlation","300117603_Temporal_Mechanisms_of_Polarization_in_Online_Reviews","295858918_When_the_Filter_Bubble_Bursts_Collective_Evaluation_Dynamics_in_Online_Communities","311490351_Quantifying_Controversy_in_Social_Media","310819053_Recommender_Systems_for_Self-Actualization","309606862_Balancing_Opposing_Views_to_Reduce_Controversy","309457236_Improving_recommendation_lists_through_topic_diversification","303362788_When_the_Filter_Bubble_Bursts_Collective_Evaluation_Dynamics_in_Online_Communities","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","280243193_Quantifying_Controversy_in_Social_Media","276412348_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_F-measure_to_ROC_informedness_markedness_correlation","274398233_Measuring_Political_Polarization_Twitter_shows_the_two_sides_of_Venezuela","262426176_Amplifying_the_voice_of_youth_in_Africa_via_text_analytics","279547233_The_Law_of_Group_Polarization","266261701_Controversy_and_Sentiment_in_Online_News"]}
