{"id":"321804736_Communication_dynamics_in_complex_brain_networks","abstract":"The topology of structural brain networks shapes patterns of interaction and signalling among neurons and brain regions, and the resulting communication dynamics is important for brain function.\nDifferent aspects of network topology imply different communication mechanisms, from routing of information through shortest paths to alternative models that involve spreading, diffusion and broadcasting.\nDifferent topological attributes promote different types of communication mechanisms.\nCommunication dynamics are subject to competing constraints and demands (trade-offs) among efficiency, cost, versatility and resilience. One aspect of cost is the amount of information needed to implement network communication. This cost is high for routing and low for diffusion, and is likely to be an important factor for determining the biological feasibility of a given communication model.","authors":["Andrea
