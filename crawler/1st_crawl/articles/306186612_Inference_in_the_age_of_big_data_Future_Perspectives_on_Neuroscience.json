{"id":"306186612_Inference_in_the_age_of_big_data_Future_Perspectives_on_Neuroscience","abstract":"Neuroscience is undergoing faster changes than ever before. Over 100 years our field\nqualitatively described and invasively manipulated single or few organisms to gain\nanatomical, physiological, and pharmacological insights. In the last 10 years neuroscience\nspawned quantitative datasets of unprecedented breadth (e.g., microanatomy, synaptic\nconnections, and optogenetic brain-behavior assays) and size (e.g., cognition, brain imaging,\nand genetics). While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply\ndiscussed, we direct attention to a less explored question: How will the unprecedented data\nrichness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more important to\ndistill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain measurements. We\nargue that large-scale data analysis will use more statistical models that are non-parametric,\ngenerative, and mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, while supplementing classical\nhypothesis testing with out-of-sample predictions.","authors":["Danilo Bzdok","B.T.
