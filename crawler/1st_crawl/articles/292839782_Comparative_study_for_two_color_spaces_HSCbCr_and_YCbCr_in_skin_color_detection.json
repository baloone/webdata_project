{"id":"292839782_Comparative_study_for_two_color_spaces_HSCbCr_and_YCbCr_in_skin_color_detection","abstract":"Most of the government as well as trade houses and defense organizations are taking advantage of biometric applications to arrange for advanced security solutions. Biometric security has already proven its significance. Even though, the application of Face recognition is used to ensure more security, safety, and prevention of deceitful act in biometric area. Face detection is one of the most valuable processes in the face recognition. Now-a-days, most of the researches are involved in the skin color based segmentation. There is no conclusion about which color space is best fit for skin color detection. This paper concentrates on the following points as 1) The input images are converted to the HSV and YCbCr model to collect the value of H,S,Cb,Cr. and check whether these values are satisfied with the threshold values. If the pixels are in the range of threshold then that pixels will be considered as skin region otherwise it is a non skin region. 2) It also gives the comparison result for both the color space as HSCbCr and YCbCr model. The defined algorithm has been tested on various real time frontal images and gets better results for HSCbCr than the YCbCr.","authors":["S. Chitra","G.
