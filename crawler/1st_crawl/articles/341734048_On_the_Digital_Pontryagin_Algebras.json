{"id":"341734048_On_the_Digital_Pontryagin_Algebras","abstract":"In the current study, we explore digital homology modules, and investigate their fundamental properties on (pointed) digital images as one of the developments of symmetries. We also examine pointed digital Hopf spaces and base point preserving digital Hopf functions between pointed digital Hopf spaces with suitable digital multiplications, and explore the digital primitive homology classes, digital Pontryagin algebras on digital Hopf spaces as a symmetric phenomenon in mathematics and computer science.","authors":["Sunyoung Lee","Yeonjeong Kim","Jeong-Eun Lim","Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["May 2020Symmetry 12(6):875","DOI:10.3390/sym12060875"],"references":["340532083_Algebraic_Inverses_on_Lie_Algebra_Comultiplications","338405556_Comultiplications_on_the_Localized_Spheres_and_Moore_Spaces","334774621_Digital_H-spaces_and_actions_in_the_pointed_digital_homotopy_category","334730792_Algebraic_loop_structures_on_algebra_comultiplications","330281076_Some_Properties_of_Homology_Groups_of_Khalimsky_Spaces","319759907_Near-rings_on_digital_Hopf_groups","316375538_On_the_digitally_quasi_comultiplications_of_digital_images","314981629_Comultiplication_structures_for_awedge_of_spheres","330250828_Homotopy_comultiplications_on_the_k-fold_wedge_of_spheres","309362904_On_the_same_n-types_for_the_wedges_of_the_Eilenberg-Maclane_spaces"]}
