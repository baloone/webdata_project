{"id":"326918316_Misconception-Driven_Feedback_Results_from_an_Experimental_Study","abstract":"The feedback given to novice programmers can be substantially improved by delivering advice focused on learners' cognitive misconceptions contextualized to the instruction. Building on this idea, we present Misconception-Driven Feedback (MDF); MDF uses a cognitive student model and program analysis to detect mistakes and uncover underlying misconceptions. To evaluate the impact of MDF on student learning, we performed a quasi-experimental study of novice programmers that compares conventional run-time and output check feedback against MDF over three semesters. Inferential statistics indicates MDF supports significantly accelerated acquisition of conceptual knowledge and practical programming skills. Additionally, we present descriptive analysis from the study indicating the MDF student model allows for complex analysis of student mistakes and misconceptions that can suggest improvements to the feedback, the instruction, and to specific students.","authors":["Luke Gusukuma","Austin Bart","Dennis Kafura","Jeremy Ernst"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3230977.3231002","Conference: the 2018 ACM Conference"],"references":["322343924_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_for_programming_education_a_systematic_review","316947290_iSnap_Towards_Intelligent_Tutoring_in_Novice_Programming_Environments","311491524_Developing_a_Computer_Science_Concept_Inventory_for_Introductory_Programming","308890128_An_Exploration_of_the_Effects_of_Enhanced_Compiler_Error_Messages_for_Computer_Programming_Novices","303502356_A_Classification_of_Adaptive_Feedback_in_Educational_Systems_for_Programming","323327559_Instructional_Design_Knowledge_Components_A_Systematic_Method_for_Refining_Instruction","323324379_Providing_Meaningful_Feedback_for_Autograding_of_Programming_Assignments","316940187_Writing_Reusable_Code_Feedback_at_Scale_with_Mixed-Initiative_Program_Synthesis","316897909_BlockPy_An_Open_Access_Data-Science_Environment_for_Introductory_Programmers","305081968_Programming_Misconceptions_in_an_Introductory_Level_Programming_Course_Exam"]}
