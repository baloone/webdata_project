{"id":"314439474_Step_by_Step_Slowly_I_Flip","abstract":"This chapter covers the incremental steps of flipping an existing course. It provides direction on how to create a new flipped course, emphasizing the need to consider cognitive load when making curricular decisions about what to include and what to leave out. To design and sequence instruction, the chapter references well-recognized instructional design models including Gagné, Briggs, and Wager’s nine events of instruction.","authors":["Betina Hsieh"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-41855-1_2","In book: The Flipped College Classroom (pp.11-36)"],"references":["299038410_Designing_Effective_Online_Instructor_Training_and_Professional_Development","269696725_Teaching_Tip_The_Flipped_Classroom","344199086_Designing_Effective_Online_Instructor_Training_and_Professional_Development","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","286265391_Instructional_design_for_teachers_Improving_classroom_practice_Second_edition","267386054_Instructional_Game_Design_Using_Cognitive_Load_Theory","260081985_Designing_Effective_Instruction","247699111_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Objectives","242403035_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_the_classification_of_educational_goals_handbook_i","242375639_Principles_of_Instructional_Design","223814726_Cognitive_Load_Theory_Learning_Difficulty_and_Instructional_Design","200772793_L_S_Vygotsky_Mind_in_Society_The_Development_of_Higher_Psychological_Processes","20626457_On_Learning_Complex_Procedural_Knowledge"]}
