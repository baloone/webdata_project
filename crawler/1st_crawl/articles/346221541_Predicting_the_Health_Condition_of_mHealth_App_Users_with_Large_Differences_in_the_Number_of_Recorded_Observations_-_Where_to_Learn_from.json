{"id":"346221541_Predicting_the_Health_Condition_of_mHealth_App_Users_with_Large_Differences_in_the_Number_of_Recorded_Observations_-_Where_to_Learn_from","abstract":"Some mHealth apps record user activity continuously and unobtrusively, while other apps rely by nature on user engagement and self-discipline: users are asked to enter data that cannot be assessed otherwise, e.g., on how they feel and what non-measurable symptoms they have. Over time, this leads to substantial differences in the length of the time series of recordings for the different users. In this study, we propose two algorithms for wellbeing-prediction from such time series, and we compare their performance on the users of a pilot study on diabetic patients - with time series length varying between 8 and 87 recordings.\nOur first approach learns a model from the few users, on which many recordings are available, and applies this model to predict the 2nd, 3rd, and so forth recording of users newly joining the mHealth platform. Our second approach rather exploits the similarity among the first few recordings of newly arriving users. Our results for the first approach indicate that the target variable for users who use the app for long are not predictive for users who use the app only for a short time. Our results for the second approach indicate that few initial recordings suffice to inform the predictive model and improve performance considerably.","authors":["Vishnu Unnikrishnan","Yash Shah","Miro Schleicher","Mirela Strandzheva"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-61527-7_43","In book: Discovery Science (pp.659-673)"],"references":["339575147_Combining_Mobile_Crowdsensing_and_Ecological_Momentary_Assessments_in_the_Healthcare_Domain","335101039_Machine_Learning_Findings_on_Geospatial_Data_of_Users_from_the_TrackYourStress_mHealth_Crowdsensing_Platform","331286008_Entity-level_stream_classification_exploiting_entity_similarity_to_label_the_future_observations_referring_to_an_entity","328291000_Smartphone_Applications_to_Support_Sleep_Self-Management_Review_and_Evaluation","323703268_Prospective_crowdsensing_versus_retrospective_ratings_of_tinnitus_variability_and_tinnitus-stress_associations_based_on_the_TrackYourTinnitus_mobile_platform","318468532_Does_Tinnitus_Depend_on_Time-of-Day_An_Ecological_Momentary_Assessment_Study_with_the_TrackYourTinnitus_Application","315791734_Personal_Sensing_Understanding_Mental_Health_Using_Ubiquitous_Sensors_and_Machine_Learning","336953105_Mobile_Crowdsensing_in_Healthcare_Scenarios_Taxonomy_Conceptual_Pillars_Smart_Mobile_Crowdsensing_Services","332816415_Exploiting_entity_information_for_stream_classification_over_a_stream_of_reviews","328460506_Requirements_for_a_Flexible_and_Generic_API_Enabling_Mobile_Crowdsensing_mHealth_Applications"]}
