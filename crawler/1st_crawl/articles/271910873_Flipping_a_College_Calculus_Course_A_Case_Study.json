Participants were 96 students consisted of mostly freshman and sophomore college students. First, we studied how the students prepared to their flipped classes. Second, we analyzed students’ quiz scores to see how flip teaching affected their scores. Finally, the students’ views were analyzed to see what they think about flipping. Descriptive statistics revealed that participants preferred watching flip class video (44%) over reading the sections of related textbook (17%) for preparation. Also, there was a significant difference between students’ average quiz scores from non-flipped and flipped section. Students got significantly higher quiz scores in flipped sections than non-flipped sections. Overall, most of the students (83%) stated that flipped-taught lessons prepared them better.","authors":["Alpaslan Sahin","Baki Cavlazoglu","Yunus E.
