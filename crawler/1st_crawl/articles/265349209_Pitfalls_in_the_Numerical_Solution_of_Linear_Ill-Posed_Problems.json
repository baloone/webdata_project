{"id":"265349209_Pitfalls_in_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Linear_Ill-Posed_Problems","abstract":"Very special computational difficulties arise when attempting to solve linear systems arising from integral equations of the first kind. We examine here existence and uniqueness questions associated with so-called \\underline{reasonable} solutions for such problems, and present results using the best- known methods on inverse Laplace transform problems. We also discuss the choice of free parameters occurring in these methods, from the same point of view.","authors":["J.M.
