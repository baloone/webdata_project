{"id":"304627725_The_study_of_gamification_application_architecture_for_programming_language_course","abstract":"Students sometimes find it hard to learn new programming languages. They often confront unfamiliar programming terms and are required to visualize the processes that happen in the computer memory. Weak students find this a burden and end up memorizing the processes without understanding them and their working. This situation invariably leads students to get low grades in their programming subjects. Some researchers suggested that an enjoyable approach must be adopted in learning difficult subjects. Studies have shown that applying gamification elements in websites engages users. \"Gamification\" refers to the use of game elements in a non-game context to increase engagement between humans and computers. This research try to solve the problem by apply gamification elements in programming language course as a new architecture of Gamification application to increase the effectiveness of learning and enhance the understanding of students'.","authors":["Firas Layth Khaleel","Noraidah Sahari Ashaari","Tengku Siti Meriam Tengku Wook","Tengku Siti Meriam Tengku Wook Tengku Wook"],"meta":["January 2015","Conference: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication","Project: Right now I'm going to finalise the effectiveness of gamification on student learning..."],"references":["266398023_Gamification_in_Theory_and_Action_A_Survey","264637700_Measuring_flow_in_gamification_Dispositional_Flow_Scale-2","261916691_Gamification_and_serious_game_approaches_for_adult_literacy_tablet_software","265644737_Assessing_the_effects_of_gamification_in_the_classroom_A_longitudinal_study_on_intrinsic_motivation_social_comparison_satisfaction_effort_and_academic_performance","265542304_An_Improved_Java_Programming_Learning_System_Using_Test-Driven_Development_Method","261919002_The_FIT_Game_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_a_Gamification_Approach_to_Increasing_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Consumption_in_School","261482302_Multiple_Intelligence_approach_and_competencies_applied_to_Computer_Science_1","261456419_Teaching_smartphones_programming_using_Android_Java_Pedagogy_and_innovation","261349623_Application_of_Online_Gamification_to_New_Hire_Onboarding","261260097_Integrating_a_science_perspective_into_an_introductory_computer_science_course"]}
