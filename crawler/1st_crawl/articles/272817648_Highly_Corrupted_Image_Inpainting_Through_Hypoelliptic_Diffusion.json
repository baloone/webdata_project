{"id":"272817648_Highly_Corrupted_Image_Inpainting_Through_Hypoelliptic_Diffusion","abstract":"We present a new image inpainting algorithm, the Averaging and Hypoelliptic Evolution (AHE) algorithm, inspired by the one presented in [1] and based upon a (semi-discrete) variation of the Citti--Petitot--Sarti model of the primary visual cortex V1. In particular, we focus on reconstructing highly corrupted images (i.e. where more than the 80% of the image is missing). \n[1] U. Boscain, R. A. Chertovskih, J. P. Gauthier, and A. O.
