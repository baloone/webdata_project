{"id":"354020524_Data_Models_and_the_Dataflow_Algebra_within_WinCASE","abstract":"CASE tools are very useful for software engineering field. They have been developed rapidly over period of time, since they provide a good deal of support to software developers, especially where software systems have become huge and sophisticated. WinCASE is one of these tools. It was invented in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, and it has been improved over period of time. Dataflow Algebra is a methodology that used to describe a formal specification of a system. Dataflow Algebra was also developed in the same department. This methodology was incorporated within WinCASE tool. \n\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard language of graphical notations. UML is used for building and documenting the artefacts of huge systems, particularly software systems. Class diagram in UML notation illustrates the kinds of system objects, and different types of relationships that exist between these objects, as well as the properties of a class. \n\nThe aim of this project is to investigate the possibility of developing the DFA methodology within the WinCASE framework by integrating class diagram in UML notation within this framework. This project was satisfactory and almost has met the requirements. Consequently, WinCASE has an editor for drawing class diagrams within the DFA methodology that can draw all basic class diagrams.","authors":["Alhadi Klaib","Tony Cowling"],"meta":["August 2021","Thesis for: MScAdvisor: Tony Cowling"],"references":["245839576_Dataflow_Algebras_as_Formal_Specifications_of_Data_Flows","2954245_Classification_of_CASE_technology"]}
