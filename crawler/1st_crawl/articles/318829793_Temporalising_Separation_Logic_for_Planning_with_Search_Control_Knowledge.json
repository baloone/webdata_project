{"id":"318829793_Temporalising_Separation_Logic_for_Planning_with_Search_Control_Knowledge","abstract":"Temporal logics are widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning for specifying Search Control Knowledge (SCK). However, traditional temporal logics are limited in expressive power since they are unable to express spatial constraints which are as important as temporal ones in many planning domains. To this end, we propose a two-dimensional (spatial and temporal) logic namely PPTL^SL by temporalising separation logic with Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL). The new logic is well-suited for specifying SCK containing both spatial and temporal constraints which are useful in AI planning. We show that PPTL^SL is decidable and present a decision procedure. With this basis, a planner namely S-TSolver for computing plans based on the spatio-temporal SCK expressed in PPTL^SL formulas is developed. Evaluation on some selected benchmark domains shows the effectiveness of S-TSolver.","authors":["Xu Lu","Cong Tian","Zhenhua Duan"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.24963/ijcai.2017/162","Conference: Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["302961384_Guiding_Planning_Engines_by_Transition-Based_Domain_Control_Knowledge","279258478_Proofs_in_satisfiability_modulo_theories","222705177_Using_temporal_logics_to_express_search_control_knowledge_for_planning","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures"]}
