{"id":"282197767_Crowdsourcing_Processes_A_Survey_of_Approaches_and_Opportunities","abstract":"This article makes a case for crowdsourcing approaches that are able to manage crowdsourcing processes - that is, crowdsourcing scenarios that go beyond the mere outsourcing of multiple instances of a micro-task and instead require the coordination of multiple different crowd and machine tasks. It introduces the necessary background and terminology, identifies a set of analysis dimensions, and surveys state-of-the-art tools, highlighting strong and weak aspects and promising future research and development directions.","authors":["Pavel Kucherbaev","Florian Daniel","Stefano Tranquillini","Maurizio Marchese"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Internet Computing 20(2):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MIC.2015.96"],"references":["284447090_Pattern-Based_Specification_of_Crowdsourcing_Applications","277881627_Modeling_Enacting_and_Integrating_Custom_Crowdsourcing_Processes","262314241_AUTOMAN_A_platform_for_integrating_human-based_and_digital_computation","224149671_Using_the_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk_for_transcription_of_spoken_language","221212888_CrowdDB_Answering_queries_with_crowdsourcing","220879122_CrowdWeaver_visually_managing_complex_crowd_work","290848943_AutoMan","262599615_CrowdLang_A_Programming_Language_for_the_Systematic_Exploration_of_Human_Computation_Systems","262412741_AskSheet_efficient_human_computation_for_decision_making_with_spreadsheets","247152121_Crowdsourcing_Why_the_Power_of_the_Crowd_Is_Driving_the_Future_of_Business"]}
