Stakeholders act over time both on them and on their environment as they participate in the development of a new technology. In the time of action designed as a historical process - from the beginnings of nuclear power till the restructuring of the industry -, the stakeholders of the governance network adapt - in the sense of Gabriel Tarde - for the production of electricity of nuclear origin without any of them mastering the whole process. Looking for changes in dominance relationships, both weak and strong, in connection with the action of future facts, offers perspectives for the assessment of strategic and organizational shifts in innovation processes.","authors":["Anne Marchais-Roubelat"],"meta":["January 2016Prospective et Stratégie Numéro7(1):79","DOI:10.3917/pstrat.007.0079"],"references":[]}
