{"id":"304711576_Leader-Follower_Fixed-Time_Consensus_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_High-Order_Integrator_Dynamics","abstract":"The leader-follower fixed-time consensus of high-order multi-agent systems with external disturbances is investigated in this paper. A novel sliding manifold is designed to ensure that the tracking errors converge to zero in a fixed-time during the sliding motion. Then, a distributed control law is designed based on Lyapunov technique to drive the system states to the sliding manifold in finite-time independent of initial conditions. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations.","authors":["Bailing Tian","Zongyu Zuo","Hong Wang"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Control 90(7)","DOI:10.1080/00207179.2016.1207101"],"references":["277559359_Leader-follower_fixed-time_consensus_for_multi-agent_systems_with_unknown_nonlinear_inherent_dynamics","276691657_Non-singular_fixed-time_terminal_sliding_mode_control_of_non-linear_systems","273480475_Nonsingular_fixed-time_consensus_tracking_for_second-order_multi-agent_networks","271623001_Distributed_robust_finite-time_nonlinear_consensus_protocols_for_multi-agent_systems","269998563_Higher_order_finite-time_consensus_protocol_for_heterogeneous_multi-agent_systems","263602328_A_new_class_of_finite-time_nonlinear_consensus_protocols_for_multi-agent_systems","260708574_Nonlinear_Feedback_Design_for_Fixed-Time_Stabilization_of_Linear_Control_Systems","220024910_Robust_Finite-Time_Consensus_Tracking_Algorithm_for_Multirobot_Systems","215658786_Bifurcation_and_chaos_in_simple_jerk_dynamical_systems","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","279215665_Finite_Time_Reentry_Attitude_Control_Based_on_Adaptive_Multivariable_Disturbance_Compensation","271479079_Fixed-Time_Consensus_Algorithm_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Integrator_Dynamics","271035833_Decentralized_Finite_Time_Attitude_Synchronization_Control_of_Satellite_Formation_Flying","263201275_Stochastic_sensor_activation_for_distributed_state_estimation_over_a_sensor_network","262410586_Finite-time_consensus_and_collision_avoidance_control_algorithms_for_multiple_AUVs","260481292_Multi-surface_sliding_control_for_fast_finite-time_leader-follower_consensus_with_high_order_SISO_uncertain_nonlinear_agents","256660768_Adaptive_cooperative_tracking_control_of_high-order_nonlinear_systems_with_unknown_dynamics","235656638_Finite-time_Consensus_for_Multi-agent_Networks_with_Unknown_InherentNonlinear_Dynamics","235606367_Dynamic_consensus_of_high-order_multi-agent_systems_and_its_application_in_the_motion_control_of_multiple_mobile_robots","224586059_Distributed_Cooperative_Attitude_Synchronization_and_Tracking_for_Multiple_Rigid_Bodies","224111044_Finite-Time_Consensus_Problems_for_Networks_of_Dynamic_Agents","222687288_Finite-time_convergent_gradient_flows_with_applications_to_network_consensus","222432657_A_novel_high_order_sliding_mode_control_scheme","221933030_Murray_R_Consensus_Problems_in_Networks_of_Agents_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Delays_IEEE_Trans_Automat_Control_499_1520-1533","220396701_Tracking_Control_of_Multiple-Wheeled_Mobile_Robots_With_Limited_Information_of_a_Desired_Trajectory","220387320_Finite-Time_Attitude_Tracking_Control_of_Spacecraft_With_Application_to_Attitude_Synchronization","30858526_Finite-Time_Stability_of_Continuous_Autonomous_Systems"]}
