{"id":"339465240_Adaptive_Consensus_of_Two_Coupled_Heterogeneous_Networked_Systems_With_Bidirectional_Actions","abstract":"The outer consensus between two coupled heterogeneous networked systems with bidirectional actions and nonidentical topologies is addressed in this paper. Based on the adaptive theory, a control protocol is designed for two coupled heterogeneous networked systems, where each system consists of double-integrator and single-integrator nodes with different nonlinear dynamics. In the light of Lyapunov method and LaSalleâ€™s invariance principle, we prove that the coupled heterogeneous networked systems can reach outer consensus by using the reported controller. Meanwhile, the adaptive controller is also given for the second-order nonlinear systems under identical and nonidentical topologies. The correctness of the obtained theory is demonstrated by two simulation examples.","authors":["Xiaobo Li","Emad Abouel Nasr","El-Tamimi A.M.","Zhiwu Li"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970866"],"references":["338882873_Design_of_Supervisors_for_Active_Diagnosis_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","338304701_Event-triggered_adaptive_fuzzy_output_feedback_control_of_MIMO_switched_nonlinear_systems_with_average_dwell_time","336726258_Fully_Distributed_Synchronization_of_Dynamic_Networked_Systems_With_Adaptive_Nonlinear_Couplings","336227675_Synchronization_in_Kuramoto_Oscillator_Networks_With_Sampled-Data_Updating_Law","333009528_Adaptive_Neural_Control_for_Switched_Nonlinear_Systems_with_Unknown_Backlash-Like_Hysteresis_and_Output_Dead-Zone","332860799_An_Approach_to_Improve_Permissiveness_of_Supervisors_for_GMECs_in_Time_Petri_Net_Systems","329262589_Parameters_Variation-Based_Synchronization_on_Derivative_Coupled_Lur'e_Networks","327616788_Quantized_Fuzzy_Output_Feedback_H_Control_for_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Adjustment_of_Dynamic_Parameters","327484546_Output_Consensus_of_Heterogeneous_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Adaptive_Event-Triggered_Control","326613188_Fuzzy_Peak-to-Peak_Filtering_for_Networked_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Multipath_Data_Packet_Dropouts"]}
