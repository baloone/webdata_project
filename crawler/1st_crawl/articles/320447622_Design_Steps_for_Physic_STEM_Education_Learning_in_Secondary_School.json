{"id":"320447622_Design_Steps_for_Physic_STEM_Education_Learning_in_Secondary_School","abstract":"This study aimed to develop the process of STEM Education activity design used in Physics subjects in the Thai secondary schools. The researchers have conducted the study by reviewing the literature and related works, interviewing Physics experts, designing and revising the process accordingly, and experimenting the designed process in actual classrooms. This brought about the five-step process of STEM Education activity design which Physics teachers applied to their actual teaching context. The results from the after-class evaluation revealed that the students' satisfaction level toward Physics subject and critical thinking skill was found higher statistically significant at p < .05. Moreover, teachers were advised to integrate the principles of science, mathematics, technology, and engineering design process as the foundation when creating case study of problems and solutions.","authors":["C.
