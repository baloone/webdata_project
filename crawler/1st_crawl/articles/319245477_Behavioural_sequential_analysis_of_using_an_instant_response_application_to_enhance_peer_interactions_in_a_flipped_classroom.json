{"id":"319245477_Behavioural_sequential_analysis_of_using_an_instant_response_application_to_enhance_peer_interactions_in_a_flipped_classroom","abstract":"To stimulate classroom interactions, this study employed two different smartphone application modes, providing an additional instant interaction channel in a flipped classroom teaching fundamental computer science concepts. One instant interaction mode provided the students (N = 36) with anonymous feedback in chronological time sequence, while the other showed their feedback by “like” ranking (N = 26). The behavioural patterns of undergraduates using these two different modes were compared. The results showed that the like-ranked feedback deepened the interaction between asking and answering questions, reduced the number of irrelevant messages, and increased attention to questionable messages. The students using the like-ranking mode also received more encouragement during the flipped classroom discussion activities.","authors":["Ting Chia Hsu"],"meta":["February 2017Interactive Learning Environments 26(1):1-15","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2017.1283332"],"references":["323546418_GoSoapBox_in_public_health_tertiary_education_A_student_response_system_for_improving_learning_experiences_and_outcomes","320711188_The_role_of_non-verbal_behavior_of_teachers_in_providing_students_corrective_feedback_and_their_consequences","344486411_Observing_Interaction_An_Introduction_to_Sequential_Analysis","324406547_Observing_Interaction_An_Introduction_to_Sequential_Analysis","303170761_The_classroom_flip_Using_Web_course_management_tools_to_become_the_guide_on_the_side","292337936_Mobile_immersion_an_experiment_using_mobile_instant_messenger_to_support_second-language_learning","290605806_Flip_Your_Students'_Learning","290565890_Enhancing_Learning_through_Formative_Assessment_and_Feedback","289968315_A_case_study_of_a_method_for_hybrid_peer-evaluation_in_engineering_education","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning"]}
