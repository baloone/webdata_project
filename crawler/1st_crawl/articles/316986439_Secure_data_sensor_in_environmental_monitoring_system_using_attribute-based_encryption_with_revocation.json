{"id":"316986439_Secure_data_sensor_in_environmental_monitoring_system_using_attribute-based_encryption_with_revocation","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks in internet of thing era have many applications, one of them for environment system, in environmental monitoring system everybody can access data anytime and anywhere. Information was collected using wireless sensor network, all of the data will be sent and stored in the data center. All of data in the data center can be accessed by users through HTTP protocol using a laptop, smartphone and Personal computer. The data in the data center must be secured and the data should be protected from the illegal access by the users from the environment monitoring. To secure the data from the illegal access by the user then the environment monitoring required a security with revocation aspect and encryption the data. CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) becomes a solution for this issue, to protect the sensor data and revoke the user. We propose a secure system using CP-ABE with user revocation for protecting the data in data center. Our system is not only encrypting the data sensor, but also revoke to the user. Our experiments system using CP-ABE showed the result for secure the sensor data and revoked the user who does not have the access rights. there are only 2 second processing time for revocation check users.","authors":["Munsyi","Amang Sudarsono","M.U.H.
