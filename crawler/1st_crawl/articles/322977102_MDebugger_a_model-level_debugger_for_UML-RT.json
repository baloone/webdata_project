{"id":"322977102_MDebugger_a_model-level_debugger_for_UML-RT","abstract":"Ideally, debuggers for Model-Driven Development (MDD) tools would allow users to 'stay at the model-level' and would not require them to refer to the generated source code or figure out how the code generator works. Existing approaches to model-level debugging do not satisfy this requirement and are unnecessarily complex and platform-specific due to their dependency on program debuggers. We introduced a novel approach to model-level debugging that formulates debugging services at model-level and implements them using model transformation. This approach is implemented in MDebugger, a platform-independent model-level debugger using Papyrus-RT, an MDD tool for the modeling language UML-RT.\nhttps://youtu.be/L0JDn8eczwQ","authors":["Mojtaba Bagherzadeh","Nicolas Hili","David Seekatz","Juergen Dingel"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1145/3183440.3183473","Conference: 40th International Conference on Software EngineeringAt: Gothenburg, Sweden","Project: MDebugger"],"references":["322977279_Survey_and_Classification_of_Model_Transformation_Tools","318325191_Model-Level_Platform-Independent_Debugging_in_the_Context_of_the_Model-Driven_Development_of_Real-Time_Systems","318123173_Evaluation_of_UML-RT_and_Papyrus-RT_for_Modelling_Self-Adaptive_Systems","308841674_The_problems_with_eclipse_modeling_tools_a_topic_analysis_of_eclipse_forums","308821196_Supporting_the_model-driven_development_of_real-time_embedded_systems_with_run-time_monitoring_and_animation_via_highly_customizable_code_generation","257491931_The_hidden_models_of_model_checking","221193419_Model-Level_Debugging_of_Embedded_Real-Time_Systems","272030492_An_executable_formal_semantics_for_UML-RT","221321502_Debugging_and_testing_behavioral_UML_models","221137706_The_Epsilon_Transformation_Language","220794942_Dynamic_Mapping_of_Runtime_Information_Models_for_Debugging_Embedded_Software","220800801_A_model_based_approach_for_debugging_embedded_systems_in_real-time","220694117_Real-Time_Object-Oriented_Modeling","216545776_Debugging_with_GDB"]}
