{"id":"335641362_A_user_requirement_oriented_web_service_discovery_approach_based_on_logic_and_threshold_petri_net","abstract":"In recent years, the number of Web services has increased significantly. Web service discovery has drawn much attention with the development of Web service applications and big data analysis. Under this circumstance, traditional Web service discovery strategies cannot adequately meet high user requirements due to the efficiency and precision of service discovery is low. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of service discovery, a user requirement oriented Web service discovery approach based on Petri nets is proposed in this study. A data preprocessing strategy of Web service is first designed. Then, a service clustering method is proposed based on Petri nets, which can conduct service cluster head generation, service cluster composition, and service discovery. The proposed method utilizes a superior data preprocessing method. Using simulation experiments, the efficiency and precision of Web service discovery are illustrated. Finally, the application value of the approach on real Web service is discussed.","authors":["Jing Sha","Yuyue Du","Liang Qi"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica PP(99):1-15","DOI:10.1109/JAS.2019.1911657"],"references":["331385711_Analysis_and_Implementation_of_the_Authentication_Protocol_8021x","313737360_A_Petri_Net_Method_for_Compatibility_Enforcement_to_Support_Service_Choreography","307573695_Exploring_the_Effectiveness_of_True_Abnormal_Data_Elimination_in_Context-Aware_Web_Services_Recommendation","303181693_Constructing_Service_Clusters_Based_on_Service_Space","277949849_A_Novel_Approavh_to_Discover_Web_Services_Using_WSDL_and_UDDI","269484432_Modeling_and_Analysis_for_Cross-Organizational_Emergency_Response_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets","224307265_A_Petri_Net-Based_Method_for_Compatibility_Analysis_and_Composition_of_Web_Services_in_Business_Process_Execution_Language","220292517_A_Framework_for_Seamless_Roaming_Across_Heterogeneous_Next_Generation_Wireless_Networks","4309790_Web_Service_Discovery_with_additional_Semantics_and_Clustering","315306199_Web_service_composition_approach_based_on_service_cluster_and_QoS","308671143_QoS_Prediction_of_Web_Services_Based_on_Two-Phase_K-Means_Clustering","290540236_Adaptive_evolution_technology_for_collaborative_SaaS_platform_of_industrial_chains","286987209_Substitution_and_analysis_of_service_composition_based_on_service_clusters","274573397_Constructing_a_Global_Social_Service_Network_for_Better_Quality_of_Web_Service_Discovery","269500551_Service_architecture_and_service_discovery_oriented_to_service_clusters","265390604_Reachability_analysis_of_logic_Petri_nets_using_incidence_matrix","262276794_Behavioral_and_structural_evolution_of_SOA_from_OO_an_integrated_approach","261167726_Research_on_semantic_Web_service_composition","261123312_Web_service_discovery_and_composition_based_on_process_model","240985447_A_Method_for_Semantic_Web_Service_Discovery_Based_on_Context_Inference_A_Method_for_Semantic_Web_Service_Discovery_Based_on_Context_Inference","221587841_WSRec_A_Collaborative_Filtering_Based_Web_Service_Recommender_System","220510204_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Real-Time_Cooperative_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets","220478915_A_vector_matching_method_for_analysing_logic_Petri_nets","220169848_Semantics-Based_Composition-Oriented_Discovery_of_Web_Services"]}
