{"id":"333738555_Computational_multiscale_methods_for_linear_poroelasticity_with_high_contrast","abstract":"In this work, we employ the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM) to solve the problem of linear heterogeneous poroelasticity with coefficients of high contrast. The proposed method makes use of the idea of energy minimization with suitable constraints to generate efficient basis functions for the displacement and the pressure. These basis functions are constructed by solving a class of local auxiliary optimization problems based on eigenfunctions containing local information on the heterogeneity. Techniques of oversampling are adapted to enhance the computational performance. A convergence of first order is shown and illustrated by several numerical tests.","authors":["Shubin Fu","Robert Altmann","Eric Chung","Roland Maier"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of Computational Physics 395(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2019.06.027"],"references":["322221096_Computational_Multiscale_Methods_for_Linear_Heterogeneous_Poroelasticity","280912121_A_Generalized_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Method_for_Poroelasticity_Problems_I_Linear_Problems","277978550_A_numerical_homogenization_method_for_heterogeneous_anisotropic_elastic_media_based_on_multiscale_theory","265089639_Generalized_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Method_for_Elasticity_Equations","242370510_A_Multiscale_Mortar_Mixed_Finite_Element_Method","228542895_Analysis_of_upscaling_absolute_permeability","29650897_A_posteriori_error_analysis_of_Euler-Galerkin_approximations_to_coupled_elliptic-parabolic_problems","316029388_Constraint_Energy_Minimizing_Generalized_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Method","309062961_Numerical_Homogenization_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems_by_Subspace_Decomposition","306187630_An_analysis_of_a_class_of_variational_multiscale_methods_based_on_subspace_decomposition","303884259_A_Two-Scale_Homogenization_Approach_for_the_Estimation_of_Porosity_in_Elastic_Media","301881249_A_generalized_finite_element_method_for_linear_thermoelasticity","301874063_Robust_Numerical_Upscaling_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems_at_High_Contrast","299537977_A_Multiscale_Method_for_linear_elasticity_reducing_Poisson_locking","277333853_Variational_Multiscale_Stabilization_and_the_Exponential_Decay_of_Fine-scale_Correctors","259291282_An_introduction_to_reservoir_geomechanics","251423586_Numerical_Calculation_of_Equivalent_Gridblock_Permeability_Tensors_for_Heterogeneous_Porous_Media","244958639_A_mixed_multiscale_finite_element_method_for_elliptic_problems_with_oscillating_coefficients","233763842_Oversampling_for_the_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Method","227971322_The_Partition_of_Unity_Method","224558403_General_Theory_of_Three-Dimensional_Consolidation","223786251_Multiscale_finite_element_methods_for_high-contrast_problems_using_local_spectral_basis_functions","222830730_Multi-scale_finite-volume_method_for_elliptic_problems_in_subsurface_flow_simulation","222447598_A_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Method_for_Elliptic_Problems_in_Composite_Materials_and_Porous_Media","222297655_Diffusion_in_Poro-Elastic_Media","51947891_Localization_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems"]}
