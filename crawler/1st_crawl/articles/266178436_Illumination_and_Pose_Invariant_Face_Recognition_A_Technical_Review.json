{"id":"266178436_Illumination_and_Pose_Invariant_Face_Recognition_A_Technical_Review","abstract":"Face recognition being the most important biometric trait it still faces many challenges, like pose variation, illumination variation etc. When such variations are present in both pose and illumination, all the algorithms are greatly affected by these variations and their performance gets degraded. In this paper we are presenting a detail survey on 2D face recognition under such uncontrolled conditions. Here we have explored different techniques proposed for illumination and pose problem in addition with the classifiers that have been successfully used for face recognition in general. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods for better understanding of reader.","authors":["K. R. Singh","Mukesh Zaveri","M. M.
