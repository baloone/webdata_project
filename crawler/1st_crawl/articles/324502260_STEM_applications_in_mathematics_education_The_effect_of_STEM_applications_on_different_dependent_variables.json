The purpose of the research is to\nanalyze the effect of STEM applications on\nmathematics pre-service teachers’ mathematical\nliteracy self-efficacy, technological\npedagogical knowledge and mathematical\nthinking skills and their views on STEM\neducation. This research has been carried\nout by 29 mathematics pre-service teachers\nwho are schoolers at the educational\nfaculties of Mus Alparslan University. The\nresearch was completed in 10 weeks (3\nhours per week) in spring semester of\n2016-2017 academic year. Mixed research\napproach was used in the study. “Mathematical\nLiteracy Self-Sufficiency Scale”,\n“Mathematical Thinking Scale”, “Technological\nPedagogical Area Information Scale”\nand “STEM Interview Form for Mathematics\nPre-service Teachers” were used as data\ncollection instruments. The collected data\nwere analyzed, and it was certain that the\nSTEM applications positively affected the\npre-service teachers’ mathematics literacy\nself-efficacy and technological pedagogical\ncontent knowledge. However, STEM applications\nwere not seemed to have a positive\neffect on mathematical thinking. Moreover,\nwhen the opinions of the pre-service teachers\nwere examined, it was identified that the\nSTEM applications changed positively the\nopinions of the pre-service teachers about\nthe mathematical literacy, and that they\nlacked many subjects such as field knowledge\nand pedagogy knowledge about\nSTEM education. Suggestions were made in\nthe direction of the findings obtained.\nKey words: science, technology, engineering,\nmathematics education, mathematics\npre-service teacher","authors":["Bekir Yildirim","Sabri Sidekli"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Baltic Science Education 17(2)","DOI:10.33225/jbse/18.17.200"],"references":["318182128_The_effects_of_an_afterschool_STEM_program_on_students'_motivation_and_engagement","287927807_5_Sinif_Ogrencilerinin_Bilimsel_Surec_Becerileri_ile_Fene_Karsi_Tutumlarina_FeTeMM_Etkinliklerinin_Etkisi","286916326_TURKISH_ADAPTATION_OF_PRESERVICE_TEACHERS'_TECHNOLOGICAL_PEDAGOGICAL_CONTENT_KNOWLEDGE_ASSESSMENT_INSTRUMENT","278848278_Teachers'_General_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_PCK_and_Content_Knowledge_of_Algebra","272121880_TPACK_Development_in_Teacher_Education","267236270_61_The_value_added_by_teacher_education","264179726_The_Effects_of_the_Learning_Motive_Interest_and_Science_Process_Skills_using_the_'Light'_Unit_on_Science-based_STEAM","263623230_Primary_Teachers'_Perception_Analysis_on_Development_and_Application_of_STEAM_Education_Program","260769742_Scale_Development_for_Pre-service_Mathematics_Teachers'_Perceptions_related_to_Their_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","258693378_A_New_Era_of_Science_Education_Science_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Classroom_Practices_of_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_STEM_Integration","255647628_Content_Knowledge_for_Teaching_What_Makes_It_Special","254637828_STEM_Integration_Teacher_Perceptions_and_Practice","225083749_Mixed_Methods_Research_A_Research_Paradigm_Whose_Time_Has_Come","338336750_Teacher_Opinions_about_the_Qualities_Required_in_STEM_Activities_Applied_in_the_Science_Course_Fen_Bilimleri_Dersinde_Uygulanan_STEM_Etkinliklerinde_Bulunmasi_Gereken_Nitelikler_Hakkinda_Ogretmen_Goru","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","316667347_AN_EXPERIMENTAL_RESEARCH_ON_EFFECTS_OF_STEM_APPLICATIONS_AND_MASTERY_LEARNING","292437653_Mixed_methods_research","285670063_Secondary_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Needs_Analysis_on_Integrative_STEM_Education","281345343_Research_on_Science_Teacher_Knowledge","264645901_The_Effects_of_a_STEM_Intervention_on_Elementary_Students'_Science_Knowledge_and_Skills","258544258_The_influence_of_female_social_models_in_corporate_STEM_initiatives_on_girls'_math_and_science_attitudes","251547740_Strategies_For_Integrating_STEM_Content_A_Pilot_Case_Study","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","229459749_Teacher_collaboration_across_and_within_schools_Supporting_individual_change_in_elementary_science_teaching","220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge"]}
