{"id":"273913765_Road_marking_extraction_using_a_MODELDATA-DRIVEN_Rj-Mcmc","abstract":"We propose an integrated bottom-up/top-down approach to road-marking extraction from image space. It is based on energy minimization\nusing marked point processes. A generic road marking object model enable us to define universal energy functions that handle\nvarious types of road-marking objects (dashed-lines, arrows, characters, etc.). A RJ-MCMC sampler coupled with a simulated annealing\nis applied to find the configuration corresponding to the minimum of the proposed energy. We used input data measurements to\nguide the sampler process (data driven RJ-MCMC). The approach is enhanced with a model-driven kernel using preprocessed autocorrelation\nand inter-correlation of road-marking templates, in order to resolve type and transformation ambiguities. The method is\ngeneric and can be applied to detect road-markings in any orthogonal view produced from optical sensors or laser scanners from aerial\nor terrestrial platforms. We show the results an ortho-image computed from ground-based laser scanning.","authors":["Alexandre Hervieu","Bahman Soheilian","Mathieu Br√©dif"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.5194/isprsannals-II-3-W4-47-2015"],"references":["275579495_Automated_Extraction_of_Road_Markings_from_Mobile_Lidar_Point_Clouds","273395305_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Automated_Extraction_of_Road_Markings_From_3-D_Mobile_LiDAR_Point_Clouds","267857898_Librjmcmc_An_open-source_generic_c_library_for_stochastic_optimization","292686181_Matching_road_edges_in_stereo-image_sequences_using_data_association_techniques","289329740_Automatic_reconstruction_of_road_Centerlines_from_mobile_mapping_image_sequences","281694819_Stochastic_Geometry_for_Image_Analysis","269294041_Video_based_localization_for_Bertha","264902699_Stochastic_geometry_for_image_analysis","262277300_Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Sampler_for_Detecting_Parametric_Objects_in_Large_Scenes","262053442_Automated_Road_Markings_Extraction_from_Mobile_Laser_Scanning_Data"]}
