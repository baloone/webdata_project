{"id":"312163434_Learning_analysis_of_K-12_students'_online_problem_solving_a_three-stage_assessment_approach","abstract":"Problem solving is considered a fundamental human skill. However, large-scale assessment of problem solving in K-12 education remains a challenging task. Researchers have argued for the development of an enhanced assessment approach through joint effort from multiple disciplines. In this study, a three-stage approach based on an evidence-centered design framework is proposed to analyze problem-solving behavior, abilities, and performance. The approach is applied to assess the online problem solving of 554 students in a Shanghai primary school. The study reveals four clusters with distinctive problem-solving behavior, abilities, and performance. The findings of this approach also corroborate the results of the Programme for International Student Assessment of Shanghai studentsâ€™ problem-solving performance. The implications and limitations of this study are also discussed.","authors":["Yiling Hu","Bian Wu","Xiaoqing Gu"],"meta":["January 2017Interactive Learning Environments","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2016.1276080"],"references":["301677206_Development_of_Children's_Problem-Solving_Ability_in_Arithmetic","271753717_From_Log_Files_to_Assessment_Metrics_Measuring_Students'_Science_Inquiry_Skills_Using_Educational_Data_Mining","257682548_Using_cluster_analysis_for_data_mining_in_educational_technology_research","256460822_Changing_Assessment_-_Towards_a_New_Assessment_Paradigm_Using_ICT","247743090_Cognitive_Diagnostic_Attribute-Level_Discrimination_Indices","236890752_Perspectives_on_Problem_Solving_in_Cognitive_Research_and_Educational_Assessment_Analytical_Interactive_and_Collaborative_Problem_Solving","228625928_A_Guide_to_Analyzing_Message-Response_Sequences_and_Group_Interaction_Patterns_in_Computer-mediated_Communication","223534162_On_the_relationship_between_individual_creativity_and_time_management","223060466_Self-monitoring_self-evaluation_and_self-reinforcement_in_children's_learning_A_test_of_a_multistage_self-regulation_model_1","220374977_Exploiting_Sequential_Patterns_Found_in_Users'_Solutions_and_Virtual_Tutor_Behavior_to_Improve_Assistance_in_ITS","44858899_You_Cannot_Have_Your_Cake_and_Eat_It_too_How_Induced_Goal_Conflicts_Affect_Complex_Problem_Solving","40906545_Controlling_Uncertainty_A_Review_of_Human_Behavior_in_Complex_Dynamic_Environments","38079038_Complex_problem_solving_A_case_for_complex_cognition","301325987_Piaget's_theory","297729361_Understanding_students'_performance_in_a_computer-based_assessment_of_complex_problem_solving_An_analysis_of_behavioral_data_from_computer-generated_log_files","289725330_Test_construction_and_diagnostic_testing","285788523_Model-Based_Tools_for_Knowledge_Assessment","284331831_Design_and_discovery_in_educational_assessment_Evidence_centered_design_psychometrics_and_data_mining","279373600_Piaget_and_His_School","278659826_Model-Based_Learning_and_Performance","277096696_Sequential_Hypothesis_Generation","275205066_Learning_Analytics_and_Computational_Techniques_for_Detecting_and_Evaluating_Patterns_in_Learning_An_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue","263541515_Using_Learning_Analytics_to_Understand_the_Learning_Pathways_of_Novice_Programmers","262187484_Thinking_Problem_Solving_Cognition","262184520_Evidence-centered_design_for_diagnostic_assessment_within_digital_learning_environments_Integrating_modern_psychometrics_and_educational_data_mining","262184467_PISA_2012_Assessment_and_Analytical_Framework_Mathematics_Reading_Science_Problem_Solving_and_Financial_Literacy","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","257455048_Validity_of_the_MicroDYN_approach_Complex_problem_solving_predicts_school_grades_beyond_working_memory_capacity","250184953_Patterns_of_Diagnosed_Mathematical_Content_and_Process_Skills_in_TIMSS-R_Across_a_Sample_of_20_Countries","249797483_Models_for_Understanding","247371663_Alternatives_to_the_triarchic_theory_of_intelligence","247371266_Toward_a_triarchic_theory_of_human_intelligence","236672804_Factors_of_problem-solving_competency_in_a_virtual_chemistry_environment_The_role_of_metacognitive_knowledge_about_strategies","234721712_Developing_Science_Students'_Metacognitive_Problem_Solving_Skills_Online","234591969_A_Brief_Introduction_to_Evidence-Centered_Design_CSE_Report_632","234562329_Linking_Formative_Assessment_to_Scaffolding","233296947_Using_the_Attribute_Hierarchy_Method_to_Make_Diagnostic_Inferences_about_Examinees'_Knowledge_and_Skills_in_Mathematics_An_Operational_Implementation_of_Cognitive_Diagnostic_Assessment","233005997_The_factors_influencing_the_outcome_of_solving_story_problems_in_a_web-based_learning_environment","232896147_Computer-based_Assessment_of_Problem_Solving_Competence","232625514_Visualising_expertise_Towards_an_authentic_pedagogy_for_higher_education","232538509_Problem-solving_instruction_and_problem-solving_transfer_The_correspondence_issue","229589665_From_Evidence_to_Action_A_Seamless_Process_in_Formative_Assessment","227819259_Defining_and_Evaluating_Models_of_Cognition_Used_in_Educational_Measurement_to_Make_Inferences_About_Examinees'_Thinking_Processes","226873200_Toward_a_Design_Theory_of_Problem_Solving","226053277_Problem-Based_Learning_What_and_How_Do_Students_Learn","223533160_Gender_and_social_comparison_effects_in_computer-based_problem_solving","222446116_The_Nature_of_External_Representations_in_Problem_Solving","52009580_Complex_Problem_Solving_-_More_than_Reasoning","46169168_The_Development_of_Problem_Solving_in_Young_Children_A_Critical_Cognitive_Skill","24063492_Higher-order_latent_trait_models_for_cognitive_diagnosis","12649655_Gender_Differences_in_Advanced_Mathematical_Problem_Solving","6783540_Neural_correlates_of_cognitive_efficiency"]}
