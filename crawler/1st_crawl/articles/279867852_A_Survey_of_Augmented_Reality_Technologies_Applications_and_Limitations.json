{"id":"279867852_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality_Technologies_Applications_and_Limitations","abstract":"We are on the verge of ubiquitously adopting Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to enhance our perception and help us see, hear, and feel our environments in new and enriched ways. AR will support us in fields such as education, maintenance, design and reconnaissance, to name but a few. This paper describes the field of AR, including a brief definition and development history, the enabling technologies and their characteristics. It surveys the state of the art by reviewing some recent applications of AR technology as well as some known limitations regarding human factors in the use of AR systems that developers will need to overcome.","authors":["Rick Van Krevelen","Ronald Poelman"],"meta":["June 2010International Journal of Virtual Reality 9(2):1","DOI:10.20870/IJVR.2010.9.2.2767"],"references":["262647314_Development_of_an_Augmented_Reality_System_for_intra-operative_navigation_in_maxillo-facial_surgery","339303893_A_head-mounted_three_dimensional_display","314677238_The_Evolution_of_a_Framework_for_Mixed_Reality_Experiences","313730983_The_computer_for_the_21st_century","313558757_Interactive_online_learning","290958354_Developer_oriented_visualisation_of_a_robot_program_An_augmented_reality_approach","290161180_The_Global_Positioning_System","287322919_Augmented_reality_and_ubiquity_in_education","284567756_Collaborative_Mixed_Reality","281490778_Mobile_Augmented_Reality","262358433_Factors_influencing_operator_interaction_with_virtual_objects_viewed_via_head-mounted_see-through_displays_viewing_conditions_and_rendering_latency","262257122_Game-City_A_Ubiquitous_Large_Area_Multi-Interface_Mixed_Reality_Game_Space_for_Wearable_Computers","262168496_Invisible_Interface_for_the_Immersive_Virtual_World","262008077_Being_Human_Human-Computer_Interaction_in_the_Year_2020","257918991_The_Computer_for_the_21st_Century"]}
