{"id":"338962254_New_OFSEP_recommendations_for_MRI_assessment_of_multiple_sclerosis_patients_Special_consideration_for_gadolinium_deposition_and_frequent_acquisitions","abstract":"Purpose: \nNew multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which exert beneficial effects through prevention of relapse, limitation of disability progression, and improvement of patients' quality of life, have recently emerged. Nonetheless, these DMTs are not without associated complications (severe adverse events like. progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Patient follow-up requires regular clinical evaluations and close monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Detection of new T2 lesions and potential brain atrophy measurements contribute to the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Current MRI protocols for MS recommend the acquisition of an annual gadolinium (Gd) enhanced MRI, resulting in administration of high volume of contrast agents over time and Gd accumulation in the brain.\n\nMethods: \nA consensus report was established by neuroradiologists and neurologists from the French Observatory of MS, which aimed at reducing the number of Gd injections required during MS patient follow-up.\n\nRecommendations: \nThe French Observatory of MS recommends the use of macrocyclic Gd enhancement at time of diagnosis, when a new DMT is introduced, at 6-month re-baseline, and when previous scans are unavailable for comparison. Gd administration can be performed as an option in case of relapse or suspicion of intercurrent disease such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other follow-up MRIs do not require contrast enhancement, provided current and previous MRI acquisitions follow the same standardized protocol including 3D FLAIR sequences.","authors":["Jean-Christophe Brisset","Stephane Kremer","Salem Hannoun","Fabrice Bonneville"],"meta":["January 2020Journal of Neuroradiology
