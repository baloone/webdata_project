{"id":"274903035_Recommender_System_Application_Developments_A_Survey","abstract":"A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.","authors":["Jie Lu","Dianshuang Wu","Mingsong Mao","Wei Wang"],"meta":["April 2015Decision Support Systems 74","DOI:10.1016/j.dss.2015.03.008"],"references":["265339537_Web-Page_Recommendation_Based_on_Web_Usage_and_Domain_Knowledge","263377228_Hybrid_Recommender_Systems_Survey_and_Experiments","262253429_Social_Factors_in_Group_Recommender_Systems","262213532_AIMED_a_personalized_TV_recommendation_system","261961254_A_Survey_on_Concept_Drift_Adaptation","259519040_Leveraging_clustering_approaches_to_solve_the_gray-sheep_users_problem_in_recommender_systems","259162856_SMARTMUSEUM_a_mobile_recommender_system_for_the_web_of_data","256721047_PB-ADVISOR_A_private_banking_multi-investment_portfolio_advisor","242104348_Item-based_top-_N_recommendation_algorithms","236840546_A_hybrid_system_of_pedagogical_pattern_recommendations_based_on_singular_value_decomposition_and_variable_data_attributes","235525878_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Social_Collaborative_Filtering_and_Hybrid_Recommenders","234057252_Context-Aware_Recommender_Systems_for_Learning_A_Survey_and_Future_Challenges","232625008_REJA_A_Georeferenced_Hybrid_Recommender_System_for_Restaurants","228832829_Recommendation_to_Groups","228774334_An_Ontology-Based_Product_Recommender_System_for_B2B_Marketplaces","228700117_DIETORECS_Travel_advisory_for_multiple_decision_styles","227132202_Group_Recommender_Systems_Combining_Individual_Models","227074394_TV_Personalization_System","226581019_Ontology-Based_Recommender_Systems","226126038_A_social_network-based_recommender_system_SNRS","226075153_Using_Rich_Social_Media_Information_for_Music_Recommendation_via_Hypergraph_Model","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","284635520_RACOFI_A_rule-applying_collaborative_filtering_system","280483409_Personalization_of_Supermarket_Product_Recommendations","277452153_PocketLens","273395718_A_Fuzzy_Preference_Tree-Based_Recommender_System_for_Personalized_Business-to-Business_E-Services","264324878_Graph_model_for_E-commerce_recommender_systems","263349598_A_web-based_personalized_business_partner_recommendation_system_using_fuzzy_semantic_techniques","262402460_Hybrid_personalized_recommender_system_using_centering-bunching_based_clustering_algorithm","262348783_A_negotiation_framework_for_heterogeneous_group_recommendation","262289166_A_Personalized_Restaurant_Recommender_Agent_for_Mobile_E-Service","262286679_Elicitation_of_latent_learning_needs_through_learning_goals_recommendation","261292678_TPLUFIB-WEB_A_fuzzy_linguistic_Web_system_to_help_in_the_treatment_of_low_back_pain_problems","260026988_Multi-criteria_collaborative_filtering_with_high_accuracy_using_higher_order_singular_value_decomposition_and_Neuro-Fuzzy_system","259510084_Extending_web-based_educational_systems_with_personalised_support_through_User_Centred_Designed_recommendations_along_the_e-learning_life_cycle","257404071_A_literature_review_and_classification_of_recommender_systems_research_Expert_Systems_with_Applications_3911_10059-10072","257391708_Recommender_systems_survey","257015970_A_trust-semantic_fusion-based_recommendation_approach_for_e-business_applications","256991922_ITravel_A_recommender_system_in_mobile_peer-to-peer_environment","256721351_A_hybrid_fuzzy-based_personalized_recommender_system_for_telecom_productsservices","243771994_Applying_Collaborative_Filtering_to_Usenet_News","241194132_Personalized_smart_TV_program_recommender_based_on_collaborative_filtering_and_a_novel_similarity_method","238799778_Recommender_systems_Commun_ACM","235417318_A_hybrid_recommendation_approach_for_a_tourism_system","233764464_SigTurE-Destination_Ontology-based_personalized_recommendation_of_Tourism_and_Leisure_Activities","228842504_Group_Recommender_Systems_as_a_Voting_Problem","228653687_Dealing_with_incomplete_information_in_a_fuzzy_linguistic_recommender_system_to_disseminate_information_in_university_digital_libraries","227007340_Context-Aware_Recommender_Systems","226299184_Generating_recommendations_for_consensus_negotiation_in_group_personalization_services","226172062_PolyLens_A_Recommender_System_for_Groups_of_Users","225924875_Data_Mining_Methods_for_Recommender_Systems","225234269_Eigentaste_A_Constant_Time_Collaborative_Filtering_Algorithm","225070239_Thinking_Positively_-_Explanatory_Feedback_for_Conversational_Recommender_Systems","224568240_A_Negotiation-Style_Recommender_Based_on_Computational_Ecology_in_Open_Negotiation_Environments","225119611_Unobtrusive_dynamic_modelling_of_TV_programme_preferences_in_a_Finnish_household"]}
