{"id":"258287315_Optimization_of_Partial_Search","abstract":"Quantum Grover search algorithm can find a target item in a database faster\nthan any classical algorithm. One can trade accuracy for speed and find a part\nof the database (a block) containing the target item even faster, this is\npartial search. A partial search algorithm was recently suggested by Grover and\nRadhakrishnan. Here we optimize it. Efficiency of the search algorithm is\nmeasured by number of queries to the oracle. The author suggests new version of\nGrover-Radhakrishnan algorithm which uses minimal number of queries to the\noracle. The algorithm can run on the same hardware which is used for the usual\nGrover algorithm.","authors":["Vladimir E.
