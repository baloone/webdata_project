One of the main parameters for designing leakage resilient constructions is the leakage rate, i.e., a proportion between the amount of leaked information and the complexity of the computation carried out by the construction. We focus on the so-called circuit compilers, which is an important tool for transforming any cryptographic algorithm (represented as a circuit) into one that is secure against the leakage attack. Our model is the “probing attack” where the adversary learns the values on some (chosen by him) wires of the circuit.\nOur results can be summarized as follows. First, we construct circuit compilers with perfect security and leakage rate \\(O(1/\\log (n))\\), where n denotes the security parameter (previously known constructions achieved rate O(1 / n)). Moreover, for the circuits that have only affine gates we obtain a construction with a constant leakage rate. In particular, our techniques can be used to obtain constant-rate leakage-resilient schemes for refreshing an encoded secret (previously known schemes could tolerate leakage rates O(1 / n)).\nWe also show that our main construction is secure against constant-rate leakage in the random probing leakage model, where the leaking wires are chosen randomly.","authors":["Marcin Andrychowicz","Stefan Dziembowski","Sebastian Faust"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49896-5_21","Conference: Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques"],"references":["280611787_Leakage-Resilient_Circuits_Revisited_--_Optimal_Number_of_Computing_Components_Without_Leak-Free_Hardware","264458092_Masking_against_Side-Channel_Attacks_A_Formal_Security_Proof","264458001_Provably_Secure_Higher-Order_Masking_of_AES","262251860_On_the_Use_of_Shamir's_Secret_Sharing_against_Side-Channel_Analysis","262162590_Higher-Order_Masking_Schemes_for_S-Boxes","225658795_Perfectly_Secure_Multiparty_Computation_and_the_Computational_Overhead_of_Cryptography","221291771_A_Fast_and_Provably_Secure_Higher-Order_Masking_of_AES_S-Box","221291683_Protecting_AES_with_Shamir's_Secret_Sharing_Scheme","220336940_Leakage-Resilient_Storage","2441336_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2348253_Efficient_Multiparty_Computations_Secure_Against_an_Adaptive_Adversary","322465158_Making_Masking_Security_Proofs_Concrete_Or_How_to_Evaluate_the_Security_of_Any_Leaking_Device_Extended_Version","312829900_Mind_the_Gap_Modular_Machine-Checked_Proofs_of_One-Round_Key_Exchange_Protocols","300019742_Secure_Conversion_between_Boolean_and_Arithmetic_Masking_of_Any_Order","299775337_Efficient_Leakage_Resilient_Circuit_Compilers","283518032_Inner_Product_Masking_Revisited","281563186_General_secure_multi-party_computation_from_any_linear_secret-sharing_scheme","267168445_Securing_Circuits_against_Constant-Rate_Tampering","266959946_Unifying_Leakage_Models_From_Probing_Attacks_to_Noisy_Leakage","265427016_Expander_graphs_and_their_application","262356200_Leakage-Resilient_Circuits_without_Computational_Assumptions","261455354_How_to_Compute_in_the_Presence_of_Leakage","242587987_Timing_attacks_on_implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman","221590273_Secure_computation_with_information_leaking_to_an_adversary","221355292_Algebraic_Geometric_Secret_Sharing_Schemes_and_Secure_Multi-Party_Computations_over_Small_Fields","221355111_Protecting_Cryptographic_Keys_against_Continual_Leakage","221354811_Towards_Sound_Approaches_to_Counteract_Power-Analysis_Attacks","221348450_Protecting_Circuits_from_Leakage_the_Computationally-Bounded_and_Noisy_Cases","221348354_Private_Circuits_II_Keeping_Secrets_in_Tamperable_Circuits","221348224_Efficient_Multiparty_Computations_Secure_Against_an_Adaptive_Adversary","220898130_Tamper-Proof_Circuits_How_to_Trade_Leakage_for_Tamper-Resilience","2582060_Timing_Attacks_on_Implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman_RSA_DSS_and_Other_Systems","2578573_Differential_Power_Analysis","2415823_Private_Circuits_Securing_Hardware_against_Probing_Attacks"]}
