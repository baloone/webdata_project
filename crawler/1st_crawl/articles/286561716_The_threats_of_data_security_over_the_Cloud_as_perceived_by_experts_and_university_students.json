It explores different data security concerns over the Cloud as perceived by experts and university students. This topic is significant because of the increasing demand for Cloud services that attracts many people to use it more frequently. Being aware of data security concerns will undoubtedly help users take precautions from unauthorized access up to data theft. The comparison between the views of experts and users of data threats over the Cloud encourages investigators to conduct further research to increase awareness and maximize security measures. This study is based on the assumption that data over the Cloud are secure.","authors":["Louai A.
