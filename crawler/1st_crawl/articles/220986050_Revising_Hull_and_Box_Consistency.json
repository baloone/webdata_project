{"id":"220986050_Revising_Hull_and_Box_Consistency","abstract":"Most interval-based solvers in the constraint logic programming frameworkare based on either hull consistency or box consistency (or a variation of theseones) to narrow domains of variables involved in continuous constraint systems.This paper rst presents HC4, an algorithm to enforce hull consistencywithout decomposing complex constraints into primitives. Next, an extendeddenition for box consistency is given and the resulting consistency is shownto subsume hull consistency.
