{"id":"321637269_The_Maximum_Edge_Weight_Clique_Problem_Formulations_and_Solution_Approaches","abstract":"Given an edge-weighted graph, the maximum edge weight clique (MEWC) problem is to find a clique that maximizes the sum of edge weights within the corresponding complete subgraph. This problem generalizes the classical maximum clique problem and finds many real-world applications in molecular biology, broadband network design, pattern recognition and robotics, information retrieval, marketing, and bioinformatics among other areas. The main goal of this chapter is to provide an up-to-date review of mathematical optimization formulations and solution approaches for the MEWC problem. Information on standard benchmark instances and state-of-the-art computational results is also included.","authors":["Seyedmohammadhossein Hosseinian","Dalila B.M.M.
