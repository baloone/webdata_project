{"id":"343829087_Designing_an_Open_Source_Virtual_Assistant","abstract":"A chatbot is a type of agent that allows people to interact with an information repository using natural language. Nowadays, chatbots have been incorporated in the form of conversational assistants on the most important mobile and desktop platforms. In this article, we present our design of an assistant developed with open-source and widely used components. Our proposal covers the process end-to-end, from information gathering and processing to visual and speech-based interaction. We have deployed a proof of concept over the website of our Computer Science Faculty.","authors":["Anxo PÃ©rez","Paula Lopez-Otero","Javier Parapar"],"meta":["August 2020","DOI:10.3390/proceedings2020054030"],"references":["338383421_Statistical_language_models_for_query-by-example_spoken_document_retrieval","330372755_An_exploratory_study_understanding_the_appropriated_use_of_voice-based_Search_and_Assistants","323448113_Automated_Assistance_in_E-commerce_An_Approach_Based_on_Category-Sensitive_Retrieval","318166894_A_Review_of_Technologies_for_Conversational_Systems","328677711_Accessible_Voice_Interfaces","327837054_Efficient_query-by-example_spoken_document_retrieval_combining_phone_multigram_representation_and_dynamic_time_warping","322721511_Voice_Interfaces_in_Everyday_Life"]}
