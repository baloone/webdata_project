{"id":"298725993_Formative_and_Summative_Assessment_in_the_Classroom","abstract":"In this article, we provide brief overviews of the definitions of formative and summative assessment and a few examples of types of formative and summative assessments that can be used in classroom contexts. We highlight the points that these two types of assessment are complementary and the differences between them are often in the way these assessments are used. We also list several resources that may be useful for teachers who wish to know more about using formative and summative assessments in their classrooms.","authors":["Dante D Dixson","Frank C.
