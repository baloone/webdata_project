{"id":"259120188_Ridesharing_The_state-of-the-art_and_future_directions","abstract":"Although ridesharing can provide a wealth of benefits, such as reduced travel costs, congestion, and consequently less pollution, there are a number of challenges that have restricted its widespread adoption. In fact, even at a time when improving communication systems provide real-time detailed information that could be used to facilitate ridesharing, the share of work trips that use ridesharing has decreased by almost 10% in the past 30 years.\nIn this paper we present a classification to understand the key aspects of existing ridesharing systems. The objective is to present a framework that can help identify key challenges in the widespread use of ridesharing and thus foster the development of effective formal ridesharing mechanisms that would overcome these challenges and promote massification.","authors":["Masabumi Furuhata","Maged Dessouky","Fernando Ordóñez","Marc-Etienne Brunet"],"meta":["November 2013Transportation Research Part B Methodological 57:28–46","DOI:10.1016/j.trb.2013.08.012"],"references":["254397225_Markets_for_Dynamic_Ridesharing_Case_of_Berkeley_California","253306777_Slugging_in_Houston_-_Casual_Carpool_Passenger_Characteristics","251530777_Dynamic_Ride-Sharing_a_Simulation_Study_in_Metro_Atlanta","232849706_Ridesharing_in_North_America_Past_Present_and_Future","226613255_Dynamic_transportation_of_patients_in_hospitals","226242590_The_rise_and_fall_of_the_American_carpool_1970-1990","221604657_Incentive-Compatible_Escrow_Mechanisms","221455260_Online_mechanism_design_for_electric_vehicle_charging","220813396_A_Mechanism_for_Dynamic_Ride_Sharing_Based_on_Parallel_Auctions","220813260_Collaboration_and_Shared_Plans_in_the_Open_World_Studies_of_Ridesharing","220650119_Ad-hoc_shared-ride_trip_planning_by_mobile_geosensor_networks","24049216_Chicken_Egg_Competition_Among_Intermediation_Service_Providers","5217264_Multi-Market_Trading_and_Market_Liquidity","288271491_Multi-hop_ride_sharing","279821207_Real-time_ridesharing_exploring_the_opportunities_and_challenges_of_designing_a_technology-based_rideshare_trial_for_the_MIT_community","277287609_Reputation_mechanisms","273698329_Counter_Speculation_Auctions_and_Competitive_Sealed_Tenders","270211680_Real-Time_Ridesharing","268343290_Real-Time_Rideshare_Matching_Problem","261399367_The_ridematching_problem_with_time_windows_in_dynamic_ridesharing_A_model_and_a_genetic_algorithm","257196245_Optimization_for_dynamic_ride-sharing_A_review","254826122_Product_differentiation_on_roads_Constrained_congestion_pricing_with_heterogeneous_users","254609320_Casual_Carpooling-enhanced","248146039_Trading_and_Exchanges_Market_Microstructure_for_Practitioners","243124921_Carpooling_Who_how_and_why","239438425_Mating_Habits_of_Slugs_Dynamic_Carpool_Formation_in_the_I-95I-395_Corridor_of_Northern_Virginia","237543277_Organized_dynamic_ride_sharing_the_potential_environmental_benefits_and_the_opportunity_for_advancing_the_concept","237124206_Auctions_and_competitive_sealed_tenders","236221580_Multipart_Pricing_of_Public_Goods","228955281_Trust_Among_Strangers_in_Internet_Transactions_Empirical_Analysis_of_eBay's_Reputation_System","227519153_Competition_for_Order_Flow_Smart_Order_Routing_Systems","227427028_Traffic_assignment_by_paired_alternative_segments","227322621_Catching_a_ride_on_the_information_super-highway_Toward_an_understanding_of_internet-based_carpool_formation_and_use","225581095_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Route_Planning_in_Dynamic_Multi-hop_Ridesharing","223294172_The_study_of_a_dynamic_dial-a-ride_problem_under_time_dependent_stochastic_environments","222663220_An_options-based_solution_to_the_sequential_auction_problem","222477176_Seattle_smart_traveler_Dynamic_ridematching_on_the_World_Wide_Web","222412837_A_Survey_of_Trust_and_Reputation_Systems_for_Online_Service_Provision","222406567_A_new_insertion-based_construction_heuristic_for_solving_the_pickup_and_delivery_problem_with_time_windows","221183923_Leveraging_Social_Networks_to_Embed_Trust_in_Rideshare_Programs","220853413_Ad_Exchanges_Research_Issues","220048500_Evolutionary_Computation_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","210303573_Counterspeculation_Auctions_and_Competitive_Sealed_Tenders","46506937_Carpooling_and_congestion_pricing_HOV_and_HOT_lanes","46491804_Dynamic_pickup_and_delivery_problems","43606509_Online_Mechanisms","23526329_Carpooling_and_congestion_pricing_in_a_multilane_highway_with_high-occupancy-vehicle_lanes","5159057_The_ambivalence_of_ridesharing","5096692_Cost_Allocation_in_Collaborative_Forest_Transportation","4890932_Relational_Costs_and_the_Production_of_Social_Capital_Evidence_from_Carpooling","4890028_The_Value_of_Value_Pricing_of_Roads_Second-Best_Pricing_and_Product_Differentiation","4813174_Incentives_in_Teams","4021921_An_incentive_compatible_reputation_mechanism"]}
