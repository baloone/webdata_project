{"id":"287562118_The_use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_digital_forensics_An_introduction","abstract":"Dr Faye Mitchell argues that the use of Artificial Intelligence, which is a well-established area of modern computer science that is capable of dealing with computationally large or complex problems, could be useful for digital forensics.

Artificial Intelligence could help to bridge the gap.","authors":["Faye Mitchell"],"meta":["January 2014Digital Evidence and Electronic Signature Law Review 7","DOI:10.14296/deeslr.v7i0.1922"],"references":[]}
