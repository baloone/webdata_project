{"id":"304021404_Are_Few_Bins_Enough_Testing_Histogram_Distributions","abstract":"A probability distribution over an ordered universe [n]={1,...,n} is said to be a k-histogram if it can be represented as a piecewise-constant function over at most k contiguous intervals. We study the following question: given samples from an arbitrary distribution D over [n], one must decide whether D is a k-histogram, or is far in L_1 distance from any such succinct representation. We obtain a sample and time-efficient algorithm for this problem, complemented by a nearly-matching information-theoretic lower bound on the number of samples required for this task. Our results significantly improve on the previous state-of-the-art, due to Indyk, Levi, and Rubinfeld 2012) and Canonne, Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, and Rubinfeld (2016).","authors":["Cl√©ment L.
