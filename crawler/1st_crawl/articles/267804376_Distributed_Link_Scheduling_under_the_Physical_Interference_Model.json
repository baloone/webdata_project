{"id":"267804376_Distributed_Link_Scheduling_under_the_Physical_Interference_Model","abstract":"A fundamental problem in wireless networks is the maximum link scheduling problem: given a set L of links, compute the largest possible subset L ′ ⊆ L of links that can be scheduled simultaneously without interference. In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in the physical interference model based on SINR constraints, and Goussevskaia et al. (IEEE INFOCOM 2009) and Wan (WASA 2009) have developed centralized constant factor approximation algorithms for this problem. Distributed algorithms are especially challenging in the SINR model, because of the non-locality of the model. In this paper, we develop the first polylogarithmic time distributed algorithm in the SINR model that gives a constant factor approximation algorithm for the maximum link scheduling problem. Our algorithm is randomized and crucially uses physical carrier sensing in the distributed communication steps.","authors":["Guanhong Pei","Sritesh Kumar"],"meta":[],"references":["228057846_A_Simple_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Maximal_Independent_Set_Problem","224500426_Capacity_of_Arbitrary_Wireless_Networks","224243973_On_a_game_theoretic_approach_to_capacity_maximization_in_wireless_networks","221628552_Cross-layer_latency_minimization_in_wireless_networks_with_SINR_constraints","221628517_An_Olog_n_dominating_set_protocol_for_wireless_ad-hoc_networks_under_the_physical_interference_model","221628472_Complexity_in_geometric_SINR","221343985_A_Log-Star_Distributed_Maximal_Independent_Set_Algorithm_for_Growth-Bounded_Graphs","220926076_Impact_Of_Interference_On_Multi-hop_Wireless_Network_Performance","220898070_Wireless_Communication_Is_in_APX","220831943_WiLDNet_Design_and_Implementation_of_High_Performance_WiFi_Based_Long_Distance_Networks","220567138_An_Optimal_Bit_Complexity_Randomized_Distributed_MIS_Algorithm","51910890_MIS_on_the_fly","51889355_Nearly_Optimal_Bounds_for_Distributed_Wireless_Scheduling_in_the_SINRModel","49753901_A_Biological_Solution_to_a_Fundamental_Distributed_Computing_Problem","47461015_Wireless_Capacity_with_Oblivious_Power_in_General_Metrics","45933895_On_a_game_theoretic_approach_to_capacity_maximization_in_wireless_networks","3334164_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multihop_Radio_Networks","3235922_The_Distance-2_Matching_Problem_and_Its_Relationship_to_the_MAC-Layer_Capacity_of_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","313377016_Distributed_algorithms_for_approximating_wireless_network_capacity","226634450_Distributed_Contention_Resolution_in_Wireless_Networks","224401773_On_the_Feasibility_of_the_Link_Abstraction_in_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","221628500_Topology_control_meets_SINR_The_scheduling_complexity_of_arbitrary_topologies","221590316_Deterministic_coin_tossing_and_accelerating_cascades_Micro_and_macro_techniques_for_designing_parallel_algorithms","221344182_Maximal_Independent_Sets_in_Radio_Networks","221343849_Brief_Announcement_Distributed_Contention_Resolution_in_Wireless_Networks_ABSTRACT","220799050_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Links_under_Physical_Interference_Model","220150114_Improved_algorithms_for_latency_minimization_in_wireless_networks","45928429_A_Constant-Factor_Approximation_for_Wireless_Capacity_Maximization_with_Power_Control_in_the_SINR_Model","3080038_The_Capacity_of_Wireless_Networks"]}
