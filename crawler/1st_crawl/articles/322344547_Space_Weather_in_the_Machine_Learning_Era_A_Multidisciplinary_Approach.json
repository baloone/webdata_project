{"id":"322344547_Space_Weather_in_the_Machine_Learning_Era_A_Multidisciplinary_Approach","abstract":"The workshop entitled Space Weather: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach took place at the Lorentz Center, University of Leiden, Netherlands, on September 25-29, 2017. The aim of this workshop was to bring together members of the Space Weather, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science communities to address the use of advanced techniques such as Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Deep Learning, to better understand the Sun-Earth system and to improve space weather forecast. Although individual efforts have been made towards this goal, the community consensus is that establishing inter-disciplinary collaborations is the most promising strategy for fully utilizing the potential of these advanced techniques in solving Space Weather-related problems.","authors":["Enrico Camporeale","S.
