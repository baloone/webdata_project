{"id":"334490314_Blockchains_and_the_Supply_Chain_Findings_from_a_Broad_Study_of_Practitioners","abstract":"Blockchain is an emergent technology that has attracted practitioner attention in the supply chain domain. Multiple motivators lead companies to incorporate blockchain technology into their supply chain. However, a number of barriers and challenges may impede the successful adoption of blockchains. The purpose of this paper is to explore how a variety of motivators and barriers are perceived by different companies from different industries. This paper summarizes survey data gathered from 173 respondents associated with the Association of Supply Chain Management (ASCM), formerly APICS. Summary statistics on blockchain adoption by various types of companies are provided to help practitioners benchmark current practice. The paper presents preliminary findings on these dimensions with some insights provided.","authors":["Sara Saberi","Mahtab Kouhizadeh","Joseph Sarkis"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Engineering Management Review PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/EMR.2019.2928264"],"references":["328255045_Blockchain_Practices_Potentials_and_Perspectives_in_Greening_Supply_Chains","327407561_Blockchain_for_and_in_Logistics_What_to_Adopt_and_Where_to_Start","262575152_Traceability_and_supply_chain_complexity_Confronting_the_issues_and_concerns","330905397_Making_sense_of_blockchain_technology_How_will_it_transform_supply_chains","328345129_Blockchain_technology_and_its_relationships_to_sustainable_supply_chain_management","324139564_1_Blockchain's_roles_in_meeting_key_supply_chain_management_objectives","323488479_Blockchain_technology_A_panacea_or_pariah_for_resources_conservation_and_recycling"]}
