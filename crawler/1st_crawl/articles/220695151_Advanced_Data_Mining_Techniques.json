{"id":"220695151_Advanced_Data_Mining_Techniques","abstract":"This book covers the fundamental concepts of data mining, to demonstrate the potential of gathering large sets of data, and analyzing these data sets to gain useful business understanding. The book is organized in three parts. Part I introduces concepts. Part II describes and demonstrates basic data mining algorithms. It also contains chapters on a number of different techniques often used in data mining. Part III focusses on business applications of data mining. Methods are presented with simple examples, applications are reviewed, and relativ advantages are evaluated. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights are reserved.","authors":["David L.
