{"id":"261278170_Access_Control_Method_for_Web_of_Things_Based_on_Role_and_SNS","abstract":"In the concept of \"Web of Things\", physical devices are seamlessly integrated into the Web. Devices can be shared to others and be utilized to create new applications. This, however, implies that devices are available to the world and problems like privacy violations and device security will become more serious without proper access control. In this paper, we propose a method that enables people to share their devices to others with flexible access control. We illustrate how to rely on existing social networks to enable owners to leverage user profiles and social links in place for creating access control policies. We integrate SNS into Role-Based Access Control Model to achieve our proposition. We also developed an application to support our method.","authors":["Jia Jindou","xiaofeng Qiu","Cheng Cheng"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1109/CIT.2012.81","Conference: Computer and Information Technology (CIT), 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on"],"references":["319393385_Towards_the_Web_of_Things_Web_Mashups_for_Embedded_Devices","242405987_Putting_Things_to_REST","224305538_Rights_Management_for_Role-Based_Access_Control","224140722_Sharing_using_social_networks_in_a_composable_Web_of_Things","221601171_Web_of_Things_as_a_Framework_for_Ubiquitous_Intelligence_and_Computing","221023746_Why_is_the_Web_Loosely_Coupled_A_Multi-Faceted_Metric_for_Service_Design","220989884_Core_role-based_access_control_Efficient_implementations_by_transformations","47616076_Reference_Architectural_Styles_for_Service-Oriented_Computing","252272267_A_Dynamic_Context-Aware_Security_Infrastructure_for_Distributed_Healthcare_Applications","245476991_Architectural_Styles_and_the_Design_of_Network-based_Software_Architectures_D","229032787_An_extended_role_based_access_control_method_for_XML_documents","228369116_More_content-less_control_Access_control_in_the_web_20","224193036_Architecture_and_Protocol_for_User-Controlled_Access_Management_in_Web_20_Applications","221305501_User-managed_access_to_web_resources","216797523_Architectural_Styles_and_the_Design_of_Network-based_Software_Architectures","4365261_Towards_a_RESTful_Plug_and_Play_Experience_in_the_Web_of_Things","3845788_A_large_scale_distributed_object_architecture-CORBA_and_COM_forreal_time_systems","2954526_Role_based_access_control_models_ieee_computer"]}
