{"id":"220762707_LarvaStat_Monitoring_of_Statistical_Properties","abstract":"Execution paths expose non-functional information such as system reliability and performance, which can be collected using\nruntime verification techniques. Statistics gathering and evaluation can be very useful for processing such information for\nareas ranging from performance profiling to user modelling and intrusion detection. In this paper, we give an overview of\nLarvaStat â€” a runtime verification tool extending Larva [2] with the ability to straightforwardly specify real-time related statistical properties. Being automaton-based, LarvaStat\nalso makes explicit the overhead induced by monitoring.","authors":["Christian Colombo","Andrew Gauci","Gordon J.
