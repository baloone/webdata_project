{"id":"296193199_ETE_3_Reconstruction_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Phylogenomic_Data","abstract":"The Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE) is a computational framework that simplifies the reconstruction, analysis, and\nvisualization of phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments. Here, we present ETE v3, featuring numerous improvements\nin the underlying library of methods, and providing a novel set of standalone tools to perform common tasks in comparative\ngenomics and phylogenetics. The new features include (i) building gene-based and supermatrix-based phylogenies using a single\ncommand, (ii) testing and visualizing evolutionary models, (iii) calculating distances between trees of different size or\nincluding duplications, and (iv) providing seamless integration with the NCBI taxonomy database.
