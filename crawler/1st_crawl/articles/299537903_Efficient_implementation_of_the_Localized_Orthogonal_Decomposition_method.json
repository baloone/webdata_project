{"id":"299537903_Efficient_implementation_of_the_Localized_Orthogonal_Decomposition_method","abstract":"In this paper we present algorithms for an efficient implementation of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method (LOD). The LOD is a multiscale method for the numerical simulation of partial differential equations with a continuum of inseparable scales. We show how the method can be implemented in a fairly standard Finite Element framework and discuss its realization for different types of problems, such as linear elliptic problems with rough coefficients and linear eigenvalue problems.","authors":["Christian Engwer","Patrick Henning","Axel MÃ¥lqvist","Daniel Peterseim"],"meta":["June 2019Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 350:123-153","DOI:10.1016/j.cma.2019.02.040","Project: Localized orthogonal decomposition"],"references":["314036868_Relaxing_the_CFL_Condition_for_the_Wave_Equation_on_Adaptive_Meshes","346691525_Sparse_Compression_of_Expected_Solution_Operators","328954995_Multiscale_Partition_of_Unity","327199016_Numerical_Homogenization_of_Heterogeneous_Fractional_Laplacians","323932158_Explicit_Computational_Wave_Propagation_in_Micro-Heterogeneous_Media","321073103_Computation_of_Quasi-Local_Effective_Diffusion_Tensors_and_Connections_to_the_Mathematical_Theory_of_Homogenization","315310419_Direct_and_Iterative_Methods_for_Numerical_Homogenization","314115551_Numerical_stochastic_homogenization_by_quasilocal_effective_diffusion_tensors","309402566_Contrast_Independent_Localization_of_Multiscale_Problems","309062961_Numerical_Homogenization_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems_by_Subspace_Decomposition"]}
