{"id":"324567508_Composition_of_the_phytoplankton_community_in_the_first_stages_of_the_Quimbo_dam_life_cycle_in_Huila_-_Colombia","abstract":"The Quimbo Dam was built over the Magdalena River in 2011 and started\nfunctioning in November 2015. In this research the composition of phytoplankton\nduring its first stages of functioning was studied through qualitative-quantitative\nanalysis as well as the relation among the most abundant species and the\nphysicochemical parameters of pH, DO, water Temperature, and conductivity\nthough correlation analysis. Quantitative results of microalgae were analyzed with\ndiversity indexes of Shannon, Margalef, Simpson and, Dominance. A total of 12\nClasses, 58 genders, and 84 species, including 8 new registers for Colombia were\nfound. The classes BACILLAROPHYCEAE, CHOLORPHYCEAE and\nCYANOPHICEAE were the most abundant in species and cells/ml. Eight species\nrepresented more than 10% of the total cells/ml in every sample and they are all\nrelated with eutrophic conditions. Dissolved oxygen and pH were measured at three\ndifferent depths in four stations showing a clear tendency to hypoxia. Further\nstudies are needed as well as sustainable strategies of management and monitoring\nfor the dam, to prevent it from reaching a deadline sooner than needed and affecting\neven more the Magdalena river basin.","authors":["Paula Martínez Silva","Jorge Leonardo Muñoz Yustres","Luis Carlos Losada Benavides","Ruthber Rodriguez"],"meta":["January 2018Contemporary Engineering Sciences 11(19):907-924","DOI:10.12988/ces.2018.8265"],"references":["324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","323777417_Structure_of_the_phytoplanktonic_community_in_a_neotropical_Dam_with_environmental_tension","323774041_Removal_of_chromium_in_wastewater_from_tanneries_applying_bioremediation_with_algae_orange_peels_and_citrus_pectin","323550440_Didactic_Mathematical_Developments_Applied_to_the_Learning_of_Classic_Passive_Filters","323550245_Direct_and_Inverse_Kinematics_of_a_Manipulator_Robot_of_Five_Degrees_of_Freedom_Implemented_in_Embedded_System-CompactRIO","323550200_Applications_Alternatives_of_Multivariable_Control_in_the_Tower_Distillation_and_Evaporation_Plant","323395155_Kinematic_model_of_the_scorbot_4PC_manipulator_implemented_in_Matlab's_Guide","322926365_Extraction_in_Laboratory_of_Heavy_Metals_Through_Rhizofiltration_using_the_Plant_Zea_Mays_maize","321913209_Design_of_a_gas_sensor_based_on_the_concept_of_digital_interconnection_IoT_for_the_emergency_broadcast_system","321425673_Zur_Vervollkommnung_der_quantitativen_Phytoplankton-Methodik_Mit_1_Tabelle_und_15_abbildungen_im_Text_und_auf_1_Tafel"]}
