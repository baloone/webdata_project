{"id":"225490679_Tight_Frames_and_Their_Symmetries","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to investigate the symmetry properties of tight frames, \nwith a view to constructing tight frames of orthogonal polynomials \nin several variables which share the symmetries of the weight function,\nand other similar applications. \nThis is achieved by using representation theory to\ngive methods for constructing tight frames as orbits of groups of unitary\ntransformations acting on a given finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Along the way, we show\nthat a tight frame is determined by its Gram matrix and discuss how the symmetries of a\ntight frame are related to its Gram matrix. We also give a complete classification of\nthose tight frames which arise as orbits of an abelian group of symmetries.","authors":["Richard Vale","Shayne Waldron"],"meta":["November 2004Constructive Approximation 21(1):83-112","DOI:10.1007/s00365-004-0560-y"],"references":["260542731_Quantized_overcomplete_expansions_in_IRN_Analysis_synthesis_and_algorithms","228339554_A_physical_interpretation_for_finite_tight_frames","225994233_Equal-Norm_Tight_Frames_with_Erasures","222828973_Signed_frames_and_Hadamard_products_of_Gram_matrices","220390877_Finite_Normalized_Tight_Frames","37988703_Isometric_tight_frames","322913250_Tight_frames_of_orthogonal_polynomials_on_the_simplex","266199036_Groups_and_characters","265585676_The_vertices_of_the_Platonic_solids_are_tight_frames","247392389_Representations_and_Characters_of_Groups","243765341_A_Course_in_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","242912860_Orthogonal_Polynomials_on_the_Hexagon","238877692_Multivariable_Orthogonal_Polynomials_and_Coupling_Coefficients_for_Discrete_Series_Representations","232243108_Fourier_Analysis_on_Groups","222563337_Least-squares_inner_product_shaping","220683266_Quantized_Overcomplete_Expansions_in_IR","220682411_Geometrically_Uniform_Frames","220162696_Orthogonal_Polynomials_of_Several_Variables","220026613_Theory_of_Linear_Operators_in_Hilbert_Space_II","200524234_A_Class_of_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series","3081343_Group_Codes_for_the_Gaussian_Channel","3077991_Geometrically_uniform_codes","2502107_Quantized_Frame_Expansions_with_Erasures"]}
