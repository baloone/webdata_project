{"id":"256720832_Split_Vertex_Deletion_meets_Vertex_Cover_New_fixed-parameter_and_exact_exponential-time_algorithms","abstract":"In the Split Vertex Deletion problem, given a graph G and an integer k, we ask whether one can delete k vertices from the graph G to obtain a split graph (i.e., a graph, whose vertex set can be partitioned into two sets: one inducing a clique and the second one inducing an independent set). In this paper we study exact (exponential-time) and fixed-parameter algorithms for Split Vertex Deletion.\n•We show that, up to a factor quasipolynomial in k and polynomial in n, the Split Vertex Deletion problem can be solved in the same time as the well-studied Vertex Cover problem. By plugging in the currently best fixed-parameter algorithm for Vertex Cover due to Chen et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 411 (40–42) (2010) 3736–3756], we obtain an algorithm that solves Split Vertex Deletion in time O(1.2738kkO(logk)+n3)O(1.2738kkO(logk)+n3).•We show that all maximal induced split subgraphs of a given n-vertex graph can be listed in O(3n/3nO(logn))O(3n/3nO(logn)) time.\nTo achieve our goals, we prove the following structural result that may be of independent interest: for any graph G we may compute a family PP of size nO(logn)nO(logn) containing partitions of V(G)V(G) into two parts, such that for any two disjoint sets XC,XI⊆V(G)XC,XI⊆V(G) where G[XC]G[XC] is a clique and G[XI]G[XI] is an independent set, there is a partition in PP which contains all vertices of XCXC on one side and all vertices of XIXI on the other. Moreover, the family PP can be enumerated in O(nO(logn))O(nO(logn)) time.","authors":["Marek Cygan","Marcin Pilipczuk"],"meta":["March 2013Information Processing Letters 113(s 5–6):179–182","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2013.01.001"],"references":["262326838_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_Split_Graphs","242968200_Optimal_labelling_of_unit_interval_graphs","229430235_Kernel_Bounds_for_Structural_Parameterizations_of_Pathwidth","228057588_A_Randomized_Fully_Polynomial_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_All_Terminal_Network_Reliability_Problem","225774880_Competing_Provers_Yield_Improved_Karp-Lipton_Collapse_Results","225524976_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Vertex_Deletion_into_Perfect_Graph_Classes","225120559_Computing_the_Cutwidth_of_Bipartite_Permutation_Graphs_in_Linear_Time","221543071_Graph_Layout_Problems_Parameterized_by_Vertex_Cover","221299137_Cluster_Analysis_for_Hypertext_Systems","220995308_Cross-Composition_A_New_Technique_for_Kernelization_Lower_Bounds","220994453_LP_can_be_a_cure_for_Parameterized_Problems","220992934_Computing_Pathwidth_Faster_Than_2","220753070_Measuring_Indifference_Unit_Interval_Vertex_Deletion","220752468_Cutwidth_of_Split_Graphs_Threshold_Graphs_and_Proper_Interval_Graphs","220617081_Interval_Completion_Is_Fixed_Parameter_Tractable","220533092_Cutwidth_of_Split_Graphs_and_Threshold_Graphs","280806320_Proper_Interval_Vertex_Deletion","279926696_Randomized_fully_polynomial_time_approximation_scheme_for_the_all-terminal_network_reliability_problem","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","265367662_Optimal_Linear_Ordering","261243918_New_Limits_to_Classical_and_Quantum_Instance_Compression","259860850_A_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_to_Sequencing_Problems","259193733_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_Protein_Similarity_Search_Under_mRNA_Structure_Constraints","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","243778990_The_travelling_salesman_problem","242452206_Some_NP-complete_problems_on_graphs","232347229_Dynamic_programming_meets_the_principle_of_inclusion_and_exclusion_1","229357950_Chapter_4_The_traveling_salesman_problem","228057585_A_Randomized_Fully_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_All-Terminal_Network_Reliability_Problem","225538722_Min_Cut_is_NP-complete_for_edge_weighted_trees","225470704_Chordal_Deletion_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","225113640_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","224812575_A_Polynomial_Kernel_for_Proper_Interval_Vertex_Deletion","224206102_Determinant_Sums_for_Undirected_Hamiltonicity","223686397_Competing_provers_yield_improved_Karp-Lipton_collapse_results","222836867_Infeasibility_of_instance_compression_and_succinct_PCPs_for_NP","222813234_Min_Cut_is_NP-Complete_for_Edge_Weighted_Treees","222692119_Cutwidth_II_Algorithms_for_partial_w-trees_of_bounded_degree","222669983_On_problems_without_polynomial_kernels","222517836_Approximating_Layout_Problems_on_Random_Geometric_Graphs","222478520_Fixed-parameter_tractability_of_graph_modification_problems_for_hereditary_properties_1","222452091_The_node-deletion_problem_for_hereditary_properties_is_NP-complete","222015507_On_Minimizing_Width_in_Linear_Layouts","221499252_Planarity_Allowing_Few_Error_Vertices_in_Linear_Time","220898750_Minimizing_Width_in_Linear_Layouts","220770551_Kernel_Bounds_for_Disjoint_Cycles_and_Disjoint_Paths","220617565_A_New_Algorithm_for_Generating_All_the_Maximal_Independent_Sets","220616568_Exact_Algorithms_for_Treewidth_and_Minimum_Fill-In","220430939_Dynamic_Programming_Treatment_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220430624_Multicommodity_max-flow_min-cut_theorems_and_their_use_in_designing_approximation_algorithms","51888624_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220155619_Some_Consequences_of_Non-Uniform_Conditions_on_Uniform_Classes","220149068_Kernel_bounds_for_disjoint_cycles_and_disjoint_paths","216877586_On_Cliques_in_Graphs","51888633_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
