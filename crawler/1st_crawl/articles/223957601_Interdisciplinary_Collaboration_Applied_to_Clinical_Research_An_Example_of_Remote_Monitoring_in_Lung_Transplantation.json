{"id":"223957601_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration_Applied_to_Clinical_Research_An_Example_of_Remote_Monitoring_in_Lung_Transplantation","abstract":"Collaboration across disciplines is vital in clinical practice. It is also needed to generate high-quality actionable research, yet few frameworks for interdisciplinary collaboration exit to promote effective communications among researchers with common goals, but varied backgrounds. A review of what has been learned about collaboration was undertaken to determine attributes of effective interdisciplinary collaboration and barriers to its realization in patients undergoing lung transplantation.","authors":["Arin Vanwormer","Ruth Lindquist","William Robiner","Stanley Finkelstein"],"meta":["May 2012Dimensions of critical care nursing: DCCN 31(3):202-10","DOI:10.1097/DCC.0b013e31824e0307","SourcePubMed"],"references":["51405520_Training_for_interdisciplinary_health_research_defining_the_required_competencies","8966151_Training_the_Transdisciplinary_Scientist_A_General_Framework_Applied_to_Tobacco_Use_Behavior","6450790_Defining_Interdisciplinary_Research_Conclusions_from_a_Critical_Review_of_the_Literature","5688329_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration_for_Healthcare_Professionals","290901399_Interdisciplinary_Research_Case_Studies_from_Health_and_Social_Science","273602188_Book_Review_Gerontological_Social_Work_in_Small_Towns_and_Rural_Communities","263608752_The_working_alliance_An_interdisciplinary_case_management_strategy_for_health_professionals","259807703_The_working_alliance_an_interdisciplinary_case_management_strategy_for_health_professionals","258180571_Enhancing_the_Effectiveness_of_Work_Groups_and_Teams","255810518_Collaborations_Challenging_but_Key","238735323_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration_Old_Ideas_with_New_Urgency","220041685_Transdisciplinary_training_programs_Key_components_and_prerequisites_for_success","51402128_Transdisciplinary_Training_Key_Components_and_Prerequisites_for_Success","13577463_Home_monitoring_of_pulmonary_function","13302674_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration","12928579_Building_and_Maintaining_an_Interdisciplinary_Research_Team","11317342_Reflections_on_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration_in_the_New_Millennium_Perspectives_and_Challenges","11070008_Interdisciplinary_collaboration_in_anaesthesia_research","10992906_Building_bridges_through_collaboration_-_A_pathway_for_interdisciplinary_research","9270307_Development_Sequence_in_Small_Groups","8966149_Facilitating_transdisciplinary_research_The_experience_of_the_transdisciplinary_tobacco_use_research_centers","7729917_Decision_support_for_the_triage_of_lung_transplant_recipients_on_the_basis_of_home-monitoring_spirometry_and_symptom_reporting","7429909_The_working_alliance_as_a_model_for_interdisciplinary_collaboration","6645228_Managing_chronic_disease_through_home_telehealth","5348002_A_Transdisciplinary_Training_Program_for_Behavioral_Oncology_and_Cancer_Control_Scientists","5348001_The_role_of_centers_in_fostering_interdisciplinary_research","5348000_Enhancing_multiple_disciplinary_teamwork","5347999_Coming_together_keeping_together_working_together_Interdisciplinary_to_transdisciplinary_research_and_nursing"]}
