{"id":"317139321_A_philosopher's_guide_to_the_foundations_of_quantum_field_theory","abstract":"A major obstacle facing interpreters of quantum field theory (QFT) is a proliferation of different theoretical frameworks. This article surveys three of the main available options—Lagrangian, Wightman, and algebraic QFT—and examines how they are related. Although each framework emphasizes different aspects of QFT, leading to distinct strengths and weaknesses, there is less tension between them than commonly assumed. Given the limitations of our current knowledge and the need for creative new ideas, I urge philosophers to explore puzzles, tools, and techniques from all three approaches.","authors":["Noel Swanson"],"meta":["May 2017Philosophy Compass 12(5):e12414","DOI:10.1111/phc3.12414"],"references":["301662541_An_algebraic_condition_for_the_Bisognano-Wichmann_Property","256576300_Gauss'_law_and_the_infraparticle_problem","248648538_Superselection_sectors_with_braid_group_statistics_and_exchange_algebras_I_General_theory","236202781_New_Light_on_Infrared_Problems_Sectors_Statistics_Symmetries_and_Spectrum","227140072_An_Algebraic_Characterization_of_Vacuum_States_in_Minkowski_Space","226516242_Locality_and_the_structure_of_particle_states","226027717_On_the_Modular_Structure_of_Local_Algebras_of_Observables","225232462_The_physical_state_space_of_quantum_electrodynamics","344849577_An_Introduction_to_Non-Perturbative_Foundations_of_Quantum_Field_Theory","344484464_From_Perturbative_to_Constructive_Renormalization","343011100_Quantization_of_Gauge_Systems","316823504_Springer_Monographs_in_Mathematics","316807104_Introduction_to_Algebraic_Quantum_Field_Theory","307718552_On_the_PCT-theorem_in_the_theory_of_local_observables","300501398_Physics_in_the_Contemporary_World","297659278_Quantum_field_theory_on_curved_spacetimes_Axiomatic_framework_and_examples","287398009_Foundations_of_quantum_gravity","271589161_Local_Quantum_Physics","268701250_Eine_Bemerkung_zu_einem_'Letter'_von_L_L'Raifeartaigh_und_einer_Entgegnung_von_M_Flato_und_D_Sternheimer","268019237_Interpreting_quantum_theories_The_art_of_the_possible","266689523_On_symmetries_in_the_algebraic_quantum_field_theory","266004870_Perturbative_Quantum_Electrodynamics_and_Axiomatic_Field_Theory","265895000_Random_Walks_Critical_Phenomena_and_Triviality_in_Quantum_Field_Theory","265809296_The_Conceptual_Framework_of_Quantum_Field_Theory","265506784_Gauging_What's_Real_The_Conceptual_Foundations_of_Gauge_Theories","263613224_Philosophical_Aspects_of_Quantum_Field_Theory_I","260935213_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Fields","259073665_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Fields","259068726_An_Introduction_to_Quantum_Field_Theory","259058784_An_Introduction_to_Quantum_Field_Theory","256327711_PCT_Spin_and_Statistics_and_all_that","256097625_Why_Gauge","253160620_From_Quantum_Fields_to_Local_Von_Neumann_Algebras","248570517_On_the_duality_condition_for_quantum_fields","247317596_Quantum_Physics-A_Functional_Integral_Point_of_View","247036121_On_the_duality_condition_for_a_Hermitian_scalar_field","245160465_Methods_of_mathematical_physics","243777036_Quantization_of_Gauge_Systems","243703861_Infrared_Divergence_in_Quantum_Electrodynamics","243165938_Asymptotic_conditions_and_infrared_divergences_in_quantum_electrodynamics","240312621_The_General_Theory_of_Quantized_Fields","238348425_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Fields_Vol","234509672_Local_and_covariant_gauge_quantum_field_theories_Cluster_property_superselection_rules_and_the_infrared_problem","234378566_Divergence_of_Perturbation_Theory_in_Quantum_Electrodynamics","229253961_Taking_Particle_Physics_Seriously_a_Critique_of_the_Algebraic_Approach_to_Quantum_Field_Theory","226675918_Haag's_Theorem_and_Its_Implications_for_the_Foundations_of_Quantum_Field_Theory","226067661_Large_field_renormalization_II_Localization_exponentiation_and_bounds_for_the_R_operation","225259009_Fields_observables_and_gauge_transformations_II_Commun_Math_Phys_15_173-200","225214326_Fields_observables_and_gauge_transformations_II","223056604_How_to_take_particle_physics_seriously_A_further_defence_of_axiomatic_quantum_field_theory","221710931_A_Perspective_on_Constructive_Quantum_Field_Theory","222813919_QFT_Antimatter_and_Symmetry","222608535_Relativity_of_temperature_and_the_Hawking_effect","222581446_The_Fate_of_Particles_in_Quantum_Field_Theories_with_Interactions","200026818_Metaphysics_A_Contemporary_Introduction"]}
