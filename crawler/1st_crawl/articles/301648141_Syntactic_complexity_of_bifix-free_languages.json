{"id":"301648141_Syntactic_complexity_of_bifix-free_languages","abstract":"We solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a bifix-free language with state complexity $n$ is at most $(n-1)^{n-3}+(n-2)^{n-3}+(n-3)2^{n-3}$ for $n\\ge 6$. Since this bound is known to be reachable, and the values for $n \\le 5$ are known, this completely settles the problem. We also prove that $(n-2)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3} - 1$ is the minimal size of the alphabet required to meet the bound for $n \\ge 6$. Finally, we show that the largest transition semigroups of minimal DFAs which recognize bifix-free languages are unique up to the naming the states.","authors":["Marek Szyku≈Ça","John Wittnebel"],"meta":["April 2016Theoretical Computer Science 787","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2018.12.025"],"references":["275279897_Complexity_of_Suffix-Free_Regular_Languages","269339553_Upper_Bound_on_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Suffix-Free_Languages","267115540_Codes_and_Automata","260679346_Upper_Bounds_on_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Left_and_Two-Sided_Ideals","259528575_Large_Aperiodic_Semigroups","242552512_Finite_Automata_and_Representation_of_Events","220520656_State_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","50378581_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Prefix-_Suffix-_Bifix-_and_Factor-FreeRegular_Languages","47438215_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Ideal_and_Closed_Languages","41055007_Quotient_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages"]}
