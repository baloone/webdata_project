{"id":"279265357_Learning_spatiotemporal_trajectories_from_manifold-valued_longitudinal_data","abstract":"We propose a Bayesian mixed-effects model to learn typical scenarios of changes from longitudinal manifold-valued data , namely repeated measurements of the same objects or individuals at several points in time. The model allows to estimate a group-average trajectory in the space of measurements. Random variations of this trajectory result from spatiotemporal transformations , which allow changes in the direction of the trajectory and in the pace at which trajectories are followed. The use of the tools of Riemannian geometry allows to derive a generic algorithm for any kind of data with smooth constraints , which lie therefore on a Riemannian manifold. Stochastic approximations of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters in this highly non-linear setting. The method is used to estimate a data-driven model of the progressive impairments of cognitive functions during the onset of Alzheimer ' s disease. Experimental results show that the model correctly put into correspondence the age at which each individual was diagnosed with the disease , thus validating the fact that it effectively estimated a normative scenario of disease progression. Random effects provide unique insights into the variations in the ordering and timing of the succession of cognitive impairments across different individuals .","authors":["Jean-Baptiste Schiratti","Stéphanie Allassonnière","Olivier Colliot","Stanley Durrleman"],"meta":["June 2015","Conference: NIPS 2015"],"references":["291035233_Hypothetical_model_of_dynamic_biomarkers_of_the_Alzheimer's_pathological_cascade","262071418_Statistical_analysis_of_trajectories_on_Riemannian_manifolds_Bird_migration_hurricane_tracking_and_video_surveillance","245022145_Toward_a_Comprehensive_Framework_for_the_Spatiotemporal_Statistical_Analysis_of_Longitudinal_Shape_Data","321346737_Analysis_of_Longitudinal_Data","312892578_Applied_longitudinal_data_analysis_Modeling_change_and_event_occurrence","281115042_Random-Effects_Models_for_Longitudinal_Data","261253763_A_Hierarchical_Geodesic_Model_for_Diffeomorphic_Longitudinal_Shape_Analysis","260993211_Estimating_long-term_multivariate_progression_from_short-term_data","259296139_Applied_Longitudinal_Data_Analysis_Modeling_Change_and_Event_Occurrence","237067978_Independent_Component_Analysis"]}
