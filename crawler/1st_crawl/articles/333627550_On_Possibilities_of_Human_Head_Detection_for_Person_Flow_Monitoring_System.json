{"id":"333627550_On_Possibilities_of_Human_Head_Detection_for_Person_Flow_Monitoring_System","abstract":"Along with the development of human society, economy, industry and engineering, as well as with growing population in the world’s biggest cities, various approaches to person detection have become the subject of great interest. One approach to developing a person detection system is proposed in this paper. A high-angle video sequence is considered as the input to the system. Then, three classification algorithms are considered: support vector machines, pattern recognition neural networks and convolutional neural networks. The results showed very little difference between the classifiers, with the overall accuracy more than 95% over a testing set.","authors":["Petr Doležel","Dominik Štursa","Pavel Škrabánek"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-20518-8_34","In book: Advances in Computational Intelligence (pp.402-413)"],"references":["323196897_A_review_on_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317071822_Robust_Grape_Detector_Based_on_SVMs_and_HOG_Features","315864981_Offline_signature_identification_via_HOG_features_and_artificial_neural_networks","304900940_EVALUATION_OF_PERFORMANCE_OF_GRAPE_BERRY_DETECTORS_ON_REAL-LIFE_IMAGES","222482794_Moller_MF_A_Scaled_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithm_For_Fast_Supervised_Learning_Neural_Networks_6_525-533","3684535_Comparison_of_classifier_methods_a_case_study_in_handwritten_digit_recognition","324791885_The_Entering_and_Exiting_Management_System_by_Person_Specification_Using_Deep-CNN","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317487839_Bi-Directional_Passing_People_Counting_System_based_on_IR-UWB_Radar_Sensors","312325575_Bidirectional_people_counting_system_in_video_surveillance","311918522_SVM_based_people_counting_method_in_the_corridor_scene_using_a_single-layer_laser_scanner","303742736_People_counting_based_on_head_detection_combining_Adaboost_and_CNN_in_crowded_surveillance_environment","283673295_Design_of_Person_Flow_Counting_and_Monitoring_System_Based_on_Feature_Point_Extraction_of_Optical_Flow","282723485_Detection_Of_grapes_in_natural_environment_using_support_vector_machine_classifier","282716825_Development_of_a_person_counting_system_using_a_3D_laser_scanner","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","262395872_Random_Search_for_Hyper-Parameter_Optimization","261387574_Real-time_accurate_crowd_counting_based_on_RGB-D_information","254034183_Bus_passenger_counting_based_on_frame_difference_and_improved_Hough_transform","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","224359745_Performance_evaluation_of_local_features_in_human_classification_and_detection","4291474_Design_and_Implementation_of_Infra-red_Based_Computer_Controlled_Monitoring_System","3839580_Automatic_recognition_and_assignment_of_missile_pieces_in_clutter"]}
