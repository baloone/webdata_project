{"id":"220992908_Boolean-Width_of_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce the graph parameter boolean-width, related to the number of different unions of neighborhoods–Boolean sums of neighborhoods–across a cut of a graph. For many graph problems, this number is the runtime bottleneck when using a divide-and-conquer approach. For an nn-vertex graph given with a decomposition tree of boolean-width kk, we solve Maximum Weight Independent Set in time O(n2k22k)O(n2k22k) and Minimum Weight Dominating Set in time O(n2+nk23k)O(n2+nk23k). With an additional n2n2 factor in the runtime, we can also count all independent sets and dominating sets of each cardinality.Boolean-width is bounded on the same classes of graphs as clique-width. boolean-width is similar to rank-width, which is related to the number of GF(2)GF(2)-sums of neighborhoods instead of the Boolean sums used for boolean-width. We show for any graph that its boolean-width is at most its clique-width and at most quadratic in its rank-width. We exhibit a class of graphs, the Hsu-grids, having the property that a Hsu-grid on Θ(n2)Θ(n2) vertices has boolean-width Θ(logn)Θ(logn) and rank-width, clique-width, tree-width, and branch-width Θ(n)Θ(n).","authors":["Binh-Minh Bui-Xuan","Jan Arne Telle","Martin Vatshelle"],"meta":["January 2009Theoretical Computer Science 412(39):61-74","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2011.05.022","SourceDBLP","Conference: Parameterized and Exact Computation, 4th International Workshop, IWPEC 2009, Copenhagen, Denmark, September 10-11, 2009, Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["266549721_Treewidth_computations_I_Upper_bounds","262272626_Finding_Good_Decompositions_for_Dynamic_Programming_on_Dense_Graphs","249386923_Width_Parameters_Beyond_Treewidth_and_their_Applications","324435449_Decompositions_de_graphes_et_algorithmes_efficaces","280688730_Algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_on_partial_-trees","269546011_A_Decomposition","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","262215493_The_Rank-Width_of_the_Square_Grid","257650158_Parameterized_Complexity","248158816_Tree_width_and_tangles_A_new_connectivity_measure_and_some_applications"]}
