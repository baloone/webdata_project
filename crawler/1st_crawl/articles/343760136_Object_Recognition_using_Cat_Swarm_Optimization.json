{"id":"343760136_Object_Recognition_using_Cat_Swarm_Optimization","abstract":"Object recognition is a prominent research area in the world of computer science. It is used to solve a variety of problems such as image processing, medical diagnostics, compression and surveillance. The primary goal of object recognition is to recognize different objects present in an image, even if the objects' size, shape and other features change. The challenge in object recognition is to recognize different objects having features invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. In this work we apply Cat Swarm Optimization technique to recognize objects. Then we compare our results with the results obtained from particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm techniques for the same task, and achieve better results in a more efficient manner.","authors":["Mahendra Prasad Nath","Santwana Sagnika","M.N Das","Manjusha Pandey"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["258510186_Discrete_binary_cat_swarm_optimization_algorithm","235996154_A_New_Cat_Swarm_Optimization_based_Algorithm_for_Reliability-Oriented_Task_Allocation_in_Distributed_Systems","233763720_An_Automatic_Algorithm_for_Object_Recognition_and_Detection_Based_onASIFT_Keypoints","228721750_Computational_intelligence_based_on_the_behavior_of_cats","271555029_Image_representation_for_object_recognition_Utilizing_overlapping_windows_in_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching","271554300_Object_detection_and_recognition_using_structured_dimensionality_reduction","261380908_Object_recognition_for_cell_manufacturing_system","224161528_Multi_objective_optimization_for_object_recognition","221013744_Traffic_sign_recognition_with_Color-based_Method_shape-arc_estimation_and_SVM","220695804_Fundamentals_of_Computational_Swarm_Intelligence"]}
