{"id":"316519975_Approximate_counting_with_uniform_constant_depth_circuits","abstract":"It is not possible to count the number of 1’s in a 0-1 sequence of length n with constant-depth polynomial size circuits, but it is possible to count the number of 1’s approximately. An earlier construction for approximately counting circuits used probabilistic arguments so the circuit itself (although it worked for all inputs) was not explicitly given. In this paper we give an explicit construction for a circuit which counts approximately. We give actually a first-order formula of constant size which approximately defines the number of elements of a subset of the set {0,1,⋯,n-1} in the structure 〈{0,1,⋯,n-1},+,×,≤〉.","authors":["Miklos Ajtai"],"meta":["October 1993","DOI:10.1090/dimacs/013/01","In book: Advances in Computational Complexity Theory (pp.1-20)"],"references":[]}
