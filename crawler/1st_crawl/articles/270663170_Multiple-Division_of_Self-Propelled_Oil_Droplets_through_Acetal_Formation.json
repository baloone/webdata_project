{"id":"270663170_Multiple-Division_of_Self-Propelled_Oil_Droplets_through_Acetal_Formation","abstract":"Self-propelled oil droplets in non-equilibrium systems have drawn much attention as a primitive type of inanimate chemical machinery. However, there has been no report where a self-propelled oil droplet exhibits other mechanical energy transfer, such as division, associated by its chemical reaction system. Here we demonstrate a novel system that exhibits both motion and division of oil droplets induced by chemical conversion of the system components. Such unique dynamics were observed in an oil-in-water emulsion of a benzaldehyde derivative, an alkanol and a cationic surfactant at a low pH. In relatively high acidic conditions, this system is capable of a high production of acetal from benzaldehyde and alkanol. Therefore, we argue that the mechanism of these unique dynamics is based on the changes of the oil droplet components and the absorption of the catalyst (H+) driven by the Marangoni instability.","authors":["Taisuke Banno","Rie Kuroha","Shingo Miura","Taro Toyota"],"meta":["January 2015Soft Matter 11(8)","DOI:10.1039/C4SM02631D"],"references":["269283254_Evolution_of_oil_droplets_in_a_chemorobotic_platform","264215386_An_Oil_Droplet_Division-Fusion_Cycle","231019416_Swarming_behavior_of_simple_model_squirmers","222434752_Microemulsion_Dynamics_and_Reactions_in_Microemulsions","12036698_The_Lipid_World","7670163_Mode_Selection_in_the_Spontaneous_Motion_of_an_Alcohol_Droplet","265610495_Dynamics_of_Chemotactic_Droplets_in_Salt_Concentration_Gradients","263293731_pH-Induced_Motion_Control_of_Self-Propelled_Oil_Droplets_Using_a_Hydrolyzable_Gemini_Cationic_Surfactant","257298112_Small_power_Autonomous_nano-_and_micromotors_propelled_by_self-generated_gradients","253083399_Composition_fluctuations_and_phase_diagrams_in_ternary_micellar_solutions","239717536_Polymerizable_Nonionic_Microemulsions_Phase_Behavior_of_H_2_O-_n_Alkyl_Methacrylate-_n_Alkyl_Polyethylene_glycol_Ether_C_i_E_j","236937265_Mode_Changes_Associated_with_Oil_Droplet_Movement_in_Solutions_of_Gemini_Cationic_Surfactants","234140923_Perspective_Nanomotors_without_moving_parts_that_propel_themselves_in_solution","231571987_Acetal_Transfer_via_Halonium-Ion_Induced_Reactions_of_Dipent-4-enyl_Acetals_Scope_and_Mechanism","230370590_Kinetics_of_acetalization_of_polyvinyl_alcohol_and_of_hydrolysis_of_acetalized_polyvinyl_alcohol","228439245_NanoMicroscale_Motors_Biomedical_Opportunities_and_Challenges","223626897_Candida_Rugosa_lipase_reactions_in_nonionic_wo-microemulsion_with_a_technical_surfactant","223002726_Organic_Reactions_in_Microemulsions","221769584_Formation_of_a_Multiscale_Aggregate_Structure_through_Spontaneous_Blebbing_of_an_Interface","51859862_pH-Sensitive_Self-Propelled_Motion_of_Oil_Droplets_in_the_Presence_of_Cationic_Surfactants_Containing_Hydrolyzable_Ester_Linkages","51677272_Complex_Shapes_and_Dynamics_of_Dissolving_Drops_of_Dichloromethane","45661311_Self-Division_of_Macroscopic_Droplets_Partitioning_of_Nanosized_Cargo_into_Nanoscale_Micelles","44573584_ChemInform_Abstract_Achievements_and_Open_Questions_in_the_Self-Reproduction_of_Vesicles_and_Synthetic_Minimal_Cells","40906504_Maze_Solving_by_Chemotactic_Droplets","38068521_Photomanipulation_of_a_Droplet_by_the_Chromocapillary_Effect","26685037_ChemInform_Abstract_Nanorobots_The_Ultimate_Wireless_Self-Propelled_Sensing_and_Actuating_Devices","24262169_Self-Propelled_Oil_Droplets_Consuming_Fuel_Surfactant","11412237_ChemInform_Abstract_Development_of_Novel_Lewis_Acid_Catalysts_for_Selective_Organic_Reactions_in_Aqueous_Media","8246980_Sugar-Based_Microemulsion_Glass_Templates","6976675_Chemical_Locomotion","6222029_Fatty_Acid_Chemistry_at_the_Oil-Water_Interface_Self-Propelled_Oil_Droplets"]}
