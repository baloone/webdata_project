{"id":"331746483_A_Glossary_for_Research_on_Human_Crowd_Dynamics","abstract":"This article presents a glossary of terms that are frequently used in research on human crowds. This topic is inherently multidisciplinary as it includes work in and across computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, psychology and social science, for example. We do not view the glossary presented here as a collection of finalised and formal definitions. Instead, we suggest it is a snapshot of current views and the starting point of an ongoing process that we hope will be useful in providing some guidance on the use of terminology to develop a mutual understanding across disciplines. The glossary was developed collaboratively during a multidisciplinary meeting. We deliberately allow several definitions of terms, to reflect the confluence of disciplines in the field. This also reflects the fact not all contributors necessarily agree with all definitions in this glossary.","authors":["Juliane Adrian","Nikolai Bode","Martyn Amos","Mitra Baratchi"],"meta":["March 2019Collective Dynamics 4","DOI:10.17815/CD.2019.19","Projects: Statistical pedestrian dynamics and modeling from continuous real-life measurementsBesuchersicherheit"],"references":[]}
