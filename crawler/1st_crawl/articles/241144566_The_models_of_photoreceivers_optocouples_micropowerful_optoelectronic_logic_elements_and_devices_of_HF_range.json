Results of designing of physical and topological models of semi-conductor structures and elements (light emitting diodes, photoreceivers, HF transistors), which accounts and modeling OLE enter into structure optocouples, OLD have shown an opportunity of their work at frequencies 0.1... 0.5 GGz at consumption of capacity of an element NOR-NOT about 150 mkWatt.","authors":["Nick Proskurin","E.
