{"id":"301334360_Sense_of_coherence_and_associated_factors_among_university_students_in_China_Cross-sectional_evidence","abstract":"Background: \nSense of Coherence (SOC) is considered as a health-promoting resource; it is mainly developed before the age of 30. The multiple demands university students face, such as study-related stress and financial difficulty, could challenge their SOC development. This study aimed to: 1) investigate the association between SOC, socio-demographic and lifestyle-related characteristics; 2) assess the effect of perceived stress on SOC controlling for other variables among the Chinese university students. Analyses were done to derive a better view on possible strategies to strengthen students' SOC and with that to promote their health.\n\nMethods: \nThe data used were from a Chinese university student health survey (N = 1,853). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the effects of varied socio-demographic, lifestyle-related variables on students' level of SOC, as well as the association between perceived stress and SOC controlling for other variables in the analysis.\n\nResults: \nBoth social support (OR = 2.56 [1.87-3.50]) and better performance compared with peers (OR = 1.64 [1.15-2.34]) were associated with a stronger SOC. Not feeling isolated at university (OR = 1.60 [1.04-2.47]) and satisfaction with the political situation (OR = 2.05 [1.57-2.67]) were also associated with a stronger SOC. This counts also for high health awareness (OR = 1.40 [1.05-1.87]) and nutrition importance (OR = 1.67 [1.04-2.69]). Perceived stress (OR = 0.81 [0.79-0.83]) was negatively associated with a strong SOC when controlling for socio-demographic and lifestyle-related variables.\n\nConclusion: \nWe suggest integrating stress coping, emotion management training programmes as well as measures promoting social integration for students and teachers at campus, promoting healthy behaviours, and creating a supportive learning environment as strategies for enhancing the SOC level of university students in China.","authors":["Janet Chu","Md Mobarak Hossain Khan","Heiko J Jahn","Alexander Kr√§mer"],"meta":["April 2016BMC Public Health 16(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12889-016-3003-3"],"references":["287212285_Only-Child_Status_in_Relation_to_Perceived_Stress_and_Studying-Related_Life_Satisfaction_among_University_Students_in_China_A_Comparison_with_International_Students","273977455_Enhancing_the_Emotional_and_Social_Skills_of_the_Youth_to_Promote_their_Wellbeing_and_Positive_Development_A_Systematic_Review_of_Universal_School-based_Randomized_Controlled_Trials","319552053_A_mediational_model_of_sense_of_coherence_in_the_work_context_a_one-year_follow-up_study","289824541_Selecting_and_Planning_Support_Interventions","285326426_Emotional_intelligence_in_the_classroom_Skill-based_training_for_teachers_and_students","284977208_Unraveling_The_Mystery_of_Health_-_How_People_Manage_Stress_and_Stay_Well","283296656_The_dimensionality_of_Antonovsky's_Sense_of_Coherence_scales_An_investigation_with_Italian_samples","279584268_The_Sense_of_Coherence_An_Historical_and_Future_Perspective","275115003_Sense_of_coherence_in_different_stages_of_health_and_disease_in_northern_Sweden_Gender_and_psychosocial_differences","270024844_The_Quest_for_World_Class_Universities_in_China_Critical_Reflections"]}
