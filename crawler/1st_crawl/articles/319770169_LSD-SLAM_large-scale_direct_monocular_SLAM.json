{"id":"319770169_LSD-SLAM_large-scale_direct_monocular_SLAM","abstract":"We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct meth- ods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.","authors":["Jakob Engel","Thomas Schoeps","Daniel Cremers"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10605-2_54","Conference: ECCV"],"references":["281559193_Using_superpixels_in_monocular_SLAM","262378171_REMODE_Probabilistic_Monocular_Dense_Reconstruction_in_Real_Time","262378002_SVO_Fast_Semi-Direct_Monocular_Visual_Odometry","261353760_A_benchmark_for_the_evaluation_of_RGB-D_SLAM_systems","254041427_An_evaluation_of_the_RGB-D_SLAM_system","254041072_OpenFABMAP_An_open_source_toolbox_for_appearance-based_loop_closure_detection","232626940_Towards_Urban_3D_Reconstruction_From_Video","230600780_Closed-Form_Solution_of_Absolute_Orientation_Using_Unit_Quaternions","224705173_Accurate_Quadrifocal_Tracking_for_Robust_3D_Visual_Odometry","224252743_Onboard_IMU_and_monocular_vision_based_control_for_MAVS_in_unknown_in-_and_outdoor_environments","224252449_G2o_A_general_framework_for_graph_optimization","221344410_Scale_drift-aware_large_scale_monocular_SLAM","221113828_Real-Time_Dense_Geometry_from_a_Handheld_Camera","303123869_Parallel_tracking_and_mapping_for_small_AR_workspaces","285250506_Semi-dense_visual_odometry_for_AR_on_a_smartphone","262332397_Real-Time_Camera_Tracking_When_is_High_Frame-Rate_Best","262254133_Semi-dense_Visual_Odometry_for_a_Monocular_Camera","261353146_Dense_visual_SLAM_for_RGB-D_cameras","261352965_Efficient_compositional_approaches_for_real-time_robust_direct_visual_odometry_from_RGB-D_data","261114125_Camera-based_navigation_of_a_low-cost_quadrocopter","258140599_High-precision_consistent_EKF-based_visual-inertial_odometry","224755740_Real-time_image-based_tracking_of_planes_using_efficient_second-order_minimization","221305256_Improving_the_Agility_of_Keyframe-Based_SLAM","221259573_Edge_Landmarks_in_Monocular_SLAM","221111724_DTAM_Dense_tracking_and_mapping_in_real-time","4334429_Parallel_Tracking_and_Mapping_for_Small_AR_Workspaces"]}
