{"id":"280124452_The_Contribution_of_Missense_Mutations_in_Core_and_Rim_Residues_of_Protein-Protein_Interfaces_to_Human_Disease","abstract":"Missense mutations at protein-protein interaction (PPIs) sites, called interfaces, are important contributors to human disease. Interfaces are non-uniform surface areas characterized by two main regions, 'core' and 'rim', which differ in terms of evolutionary conservation and physico-chemical properties. Moreover, within interfaces, only a small subset of residues ('hot spots') is crucial for the binding free energy of the protein-protein complex. We performed a large-scale structural analysis of human single amino acid variations (SAVs) and demonstrated that disease-causing mutations are preferentially located within the interface core, as opposed to the rim (p< 0.01). In contrast, the interface rim is significantly enriched in polymorphisms, similar to the remaining non-interacting surface. Energetic hot spots tend to be enriched in disease-causing mutations compared to non-hot spots (p=0.05), regardless of their occurrence in core or rim residues. For individual amino acids, the frequency of substitution into a polymorphism or disease-causing mutation differed to other amino acids and was related to its structural location, as was the type of physico-chemical change introduced by the SAV. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the different distribution and properties of disease-causing SAVs and polymorphisms within different structural regions and in relation to the energetic contribution of amino acid in protein-protein interfaces, thus highlighting the importance of a structural system biology approach for predicting the effect of SAVs.\nCopyright Â© 2015.
