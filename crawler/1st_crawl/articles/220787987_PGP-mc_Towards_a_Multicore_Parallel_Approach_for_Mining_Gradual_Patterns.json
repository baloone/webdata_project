{"id":"220787987_PGP-mc_Towards_a_Multicore_Parallel_Approach_for_Mining_Gradual_Patterns","abstract":"Gradual patterns highlight complex order correlations of the form “The more/less X, the more/less Y”. Only recently algorithms have appeared to mine efficiently gradual rules. However, due to the complexity of mining gradual\nrules, these algorithms cannot yet scale on huge real world datasets. In this paper, we propose to exploit parallelism in\norder to enhance the performances of the fastest existing one (GRITE). Through a detailed experimental study, we show that\nour parallel algorithm scales very well with the number of cores available.","authors":["Anne Laurent","Benjamin Négrevergne","Nicolas Sicard","Alexandre Termier"],"meta":["April 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-12026-8_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Database Systems for Advanced Applications, 15th International Conference, DASFAA 2010, Tsukuba, Japan, April 1-4, 2010, Proceedings, Part I"],"references":["242090379_Gradual_Trends_in_Fuzzy_Sequential_Patterns","221465901_GRAANK_Exploiting_Rank_Correlations_for_Extracting_Gradual_Itemsets","221410756_Fast_Extraction_of_Gradual_Association_Rules_A_Heuristic_Based_Method","224683284_Adaptive_Parallel_Graph_Mining_for_CMP_Architectures","221460755_Mining_Frequent_Gradual_Itemsets_from_Large_Databases","220699789_Association_Rules_for_Expressing_Gradual_Dependencies","220538751_Mining_Tree-Structured_Data_on_Multicore_Systems","220031840_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Discover_Gradual_Dependencies"]}
