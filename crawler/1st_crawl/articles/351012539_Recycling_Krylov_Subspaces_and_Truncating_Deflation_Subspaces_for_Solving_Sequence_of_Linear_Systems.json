{"id":"351012539_Recycling_Krylov_Subspaces_and_Truncating_Deflation_Subspaces_for_Solving_Sequence_of_Linear_Systems","abstract":"This article presents deflation strategies related to recycling Krylov subspace methods for solving one or a sequence of linear systems of equations. Besides well-known strategies of deflation, Ritz-, and harmonic Ritz-based deflation, we introduce an Singular Value Decomposition based deflation technique. We consider the recycling in two contexts: recycling the Krylov subspace between the restart cycles and recycling a deflation subspace when the matrix changes in a sequence of linear systems. Numerical experiments on real-life reservoir simulation demonstrate the impact of our proposed strategy.","authors":["Hussam Al Daas","Laura Grigori","Pascal HÃ©non","Philippe Ricoux"],"meta":["April 2021ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 47(2):1-30","DOI:10.1145/3439746"],"references":["287687058_Krylov-Subspace_Recycling_via_the_POD-Augmented_Conjugate-Gradient_Method","263048406_Recycling_BiCGSTAB_with_an_Application_to_Parametric_Model_Order_Reduction","262292084_On_the_Construction_of_Deflation-Based_Preconditioners","345274763_A_survey_of_subspace_recycling_iterative_methods","332993409_A_GMRES_Convergence_Analysis_for_Localized_Invariant_Subspace_Ill-Conditioning","315365786_Block_Iterative_Methods_and_Recycling_for_Improved_Scalability_of_Linear_Solvers","314775889_Tenth_SPE_Comparative_Solution_Project_A_Comparison_of_Upscaling_Techniques","312938251_Tenth_SPE_Comparative_Solution_Project_a_Comparison_of_Upscaling_Techniques","266662308_Parallel_Scalable_Unstructured_CPR-Type_Linear_Solver_for_Reservoir_Simulation","255022003_A_modification_to_the_GMRES_method_for_ill-conditioned_linear_systems"]}
