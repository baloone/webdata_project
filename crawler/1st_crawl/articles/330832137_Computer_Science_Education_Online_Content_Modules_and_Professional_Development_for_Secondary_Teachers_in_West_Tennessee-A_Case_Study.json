Sci. Educ. 25:199â€“237, 2015) [1]. The goal for the Online Content Modules: Computer Science in the Middle Grades project was the development of five online content modules with a focus on computer science instruction in three public school districts in West Tennessee, and disseminated through a week-long professional development summer institute.","authors":["Lee Allen"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-12385-7_38","In book: Advances in Information and Communication (pp.523-532)"],"references":["276852167_Designing_for_deeper_learning_in_a_blended_computer_science_course_for_middle_school_students","262368270_Remedying_misperceptions_of_computer_science_among_middle_school_students","254462492_Infusing_computational_thinking_into_the_middle-_and_high-school_curriculum","254006849_The_fairy_performance_assessment_Measuring_computational_thinking_in_middle_school","250184906_Integration_of_Technology_Curriculum_and_Professional_Development_for_Advancing_Middle_School_Mathematics_Three_Large-Scale_Studies","284891272_Rural_elementary_school_teachers'_technology_integration","273966929_Advancing_Academic_Achievement_Through_Career_Relevance_in_the_Middle_Grades_A_Longitudinal_Evaluation_of_CareerStart","271347990_Fennema-Sherman_Mathematics_Attitudes_Scales_Instruments_Designed_to_Measure_Attitudes_toward_the_Learning_of_Mathematics_by_Females_and_Males","257690657_The_effectiveness_of_educational_technology_applications_for_enhancing_mathematics_achievement_in_K-12_classrooms_A_meta-analysis","254007478_Integrating_Computing_into_Middle_School_Disciplines_Through_Projects"]}
