{"id":"269311203_On_the_assumption_of_mutual_independence_of_jitter_realizations_in_P-TRNG_stochastic_models","abstract":"Security in true random number generation in cryptography is based on entropy per bit at the generator output. The entropy is evaluated using stochastic models. Several recent works propose stochastic models based on assumptions related to selected physical analog phenomena such as noise or jittery signal and on the knowledge of the principle of randomness extraction from the obtained analog signal. However, these assumptions simplify often considerably the underlying analog processes, which include several noise sources. In this paper, we present a new comprehensive multilevel approach, which enables to build the stochastic model based on detailed analysis of noise sources starting at transistor level and on conversion of the noise to the clock jitter exploited at the generator level. Using this approach, we can estimate proportion of the jitter coming only from the thermal noise, which is included in the total clock jitter.","authors":["Patrick Haddad","Yannick Teglia","Florent Bernard","Viktor Fischer"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.7873/DATE.2014.052","Conference: Design Automation and Test in Europe"],"references":["256444378_Contactless_Electromagnetic_Active_Attack_on_Ring_Oscillator_Based_True_Random_Number_Generator","47652812_Mathematical_Model_of_Physical_RNGs_Based_On_Coherent_Sampling","4172947_Investigation_of_the_Thermal_Noise_of_MOS_Transistors_under_Analog_and_RF_Operating_Conditions","3541094_Flicker_noise_characteristics_of_advanced_MOS_technologies","295748962_Calculate_oscillator_jitter_by_using_phase-noise_analysis_Part_2_of_two_parts","290617765_Stochastic_Model_of_a_Metastability-Based_True_Random_Number_Generator","273394928_Towards_an_Oscillator_Based_TRNG_with_a_Certified_Entropy_Rate","261502163_An_open-source_multi-FPGA_modular_system_for_fair_benchmarking_of_True_Random_Number_Generators","252595244_Noise_Sources_in_Bulk_CMOS","234403518_Should_the_Classical_Variance_Be_Used_As_a_Basic_Measure_in_Standards_Metrology","225977501_On_the_Security_of_Oscillator-Based_Random_Number_Generators","221291608_The_Frequency_Injection_Attack_on_Ring-Oscillator-Based_True_Random_Number_Generators","221239584_A_Design_Procedure_for_Oscillator-Based_Hardware_Random_Number_Generator_with_Stochastic_Behavior_Modeling","220331462_A_Provably_Secure_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Built-In_Tolerance_to_Active_Attacks","3049437_A_Provably_Secure_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Built-In_Tolerance_to_Active_Attacks","2989179_Statistics_of_Atomic_Frequency_Standards","2983217_Phase_Noise_and_Jitter_in_CMOS_Ring_Oscillators","2978048_Jitter_and_phase_noise_in_ring_oscillators","2977506_Jitter_in_ring_oscillators"]}
