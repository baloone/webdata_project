{"id":"340047098_Black_Women_in_Computing_and_Technology_Identity_affirmation_and_Resistance","abstract":"Considering black women in Brazil as a research subject involves new challenges about topics that are increasingly complex. In this sense, pertinent questions arise in seeking to comprehend contemporary phenomena and, consequently, leave room for disputable formulations, especially in areas of which science and technology have little understanding. This article offers a bibliographical essay that aims to begin the path to include black women in computing and technology, in a social background of sexism and racial segregation. Furthermore, it presents a summary of the resistance strategies used in black womenâ€™s course in this area by analyzing the elements of black identity strengthened by these initiatives in Brazil and abroad.","authors":["Mory Marcia De Oliveira Lobo","Karen Figueiredo","Cristiano Maciel"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.19153/cleiej.22.2.9","Project: Gender, Race and Meninas Digitais (Digital Girls)"],"references":["287731140_Educacao_e_Identidade_Negra","276532717_Mulheres_negras_moldando_a_teoria_feminista","273716784_Navigating_Underrepresented_STEM_Spaces_Experiences_of_Black_Women_in_US_Computing_Science_Higher_Education_Programs_Who_Actualize_Success","332578258_TICS_resistencia_das_mulheres_negras","326051768_Digital_girls_program_disseminating_computer_science_to_girls_in_Brazil","240917144_Globalization_The_human_consequences","226346049_Hume_on_identity_A_defense"]}
