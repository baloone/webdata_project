{"id":"222701943_Extending_the_TAM_for_a_World-Wide-Web_context","abstract":"Ease of use and usefulness are believed to be fundamental in determining the acceptance and use of various, corporate ITs. These beliefs, however, may not explain the user???s behavior toward newly emerging ITs, such as the World-Wide-Web (WWW).In this study, we introduce playfulness as a new factor that reflects the user???s intrinsic belief in WWW acceptance. Using it as an intrinsic motivation factor, we extend and empirically validate the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the WWW context.","authors":["Ji-Won Moon","Young-Gul Kim"],"meta":["February 2001Information & Management 38(4):217-230","DOI:10.1016/S0378-7206(00)00061-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["258846992_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_Of_Use_And_User_Accep","232541667_The_playful_child_Measurement_of_a_disposition_to_play","232454636_Playfulness_Definition_design_and_measurement","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","226275672_Reconceptualizing_of_the_overjustification_effect_A_template-matching_approach","220079846_Predicting_User_Intentions_Comparing_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_with_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","35465050_A_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_Empirically_Testing_New_End-User_Information_Systems","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","312940798_Of_art_and_work_Aesthetic_experience_and_the_psychology_of_work_feelings","300922483_Playfulness_in_Studies_of_Play_Imagination_and_Creativity","289963269_Re-Examining_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_Usefulness_A_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis","284337475_Of_art_and_work_Aesthetic_experience_and_the_psychology_of_work_feelings","284129027_What_makes_computer_games_fun_abstract_only","278936402_The_Adult_Playfulness_Scale_An_Initial_Assessment","277434875_Individual_characteristics_associated_with_World_Wide_Web_use","275796139_Attitude_and_Attitude_Change","269575428_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_With_Reading","256619062_The_effects_of_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_reinforcement_contingencies_on_task_behavior","256308791_Undermining_overjustification_Inducing_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_task_representations","249682926_Flow_in_Computer-Mediated_CommunicationElectronic_Mail_and_Voice_Mail_Evaluation_and_Impacts","247880461_THE_ADULT_PLAYFULNESS_SCALE_AN_INITIAL_ASSESSMENT","246494986_Belief_Attitude_Intention_and_Behavior_An_Introduction_to_Theory_and_Research","245752825_Computer_Training_and_Computer_Anxiety_in_the_Educational_Process_An_Experimental_Analysis","242557998_Validating_Instruments_in_MIS_Research","242421710_The_respective_roles_of_perceived_usefulness_perceived_fun_in_the_acceptance_of_microcomputer_technology","241800748_On_the_Use_Usefulness_and_Ease_of_Use_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling_in_MIS_Research_A_Note_of_Caution","240178877_Playfulness_Its_Relationship_to_Imagination_and_Creativity","239539685_What_makes_computer_games_fun_byte","235913783_Intrinsic_Motivation","235361368_A_Paradigm_For_Developing_Better_Measures_Of_Marketing_Constructs","234756887_Playing_at_innovation_in_the_computer_revolution","234021313_Assessing_Construct_Validity_in_Organization_Research","233896840_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","229514608_Extrinsic_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_to_Use_Computers_in_the_Workplace1","227867445_Effects_of_feedback_and_playfulness_on_performance_in_microcomputer_software_training","227837535_Using_Davis's_Perceived_Usefulness_and_Ease-of-use_Instruments_for_Decision_Making_A_Confirmatory_and_Multigroup_Invariance_Analysis","222487168_Extending_the_technology_acceptance_model_with_task-technology_fit_constructs","222472898_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_in_Internet_usage","222448281_Toward_a_Theory_of_Intrinsically_Motivating_Instruction","222311413_Usefulness_and_ease_of_use_Field_study_evidence_regarding_task_considerations","222234808_The_dimensionality_and_correlates_of_flow_in_human-computer_interactions","221180536_Extending_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_to_Account_for_Social_Influence_Theoretical_Bases_and_Empirical_Validation","220627999_Individual_Characteristics_Associated_with_World_Wide_Web_Use_An_Empirical_Study_of_Playfulness_and_Motivation","220591598_A_Motivational_Model_of_Microcomputer_Usage","220260365_Microcomputer_Playfulness_Developing_a_Measure_With_Workplace_Implications","220259955_Perceived_Usefulness_Ease_of_Use_and_Usage_of_Information_Technology_A_Replication","49551764_Attitude_and_Attitude_Change","21995257_Self-Perceptions_of_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivation"]}
