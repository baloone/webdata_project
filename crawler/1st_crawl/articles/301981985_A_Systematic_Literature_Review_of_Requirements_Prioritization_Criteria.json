{"id":"301981985_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Requirements_Prioritization_Criteria","abstract":"[Context & motivation] Requirements prioritization is typically applied in order to determine which requirements or features should be included in a certain release or implemented first. While most requirements prioritization approaches prescribe a fixed set of prioritization criteria that have to be assessed during the prioritization process, there is often a need for criteria that are customized to the specific project situation. [Question/problem] However, determining customized prioritization criteria is a time-consuming and laborious task. Instead of an in-depth analysis, criteria are often identified by gut feeling, which is error-prone and bears the risk of choosing misleading criteria. [Principal ideas/results] This paper aims at identifying and categorizing prioritization criteria discussed in the vast body of prioritization literature for software development. We describe a systematic literature review and, as a result, present a consolidated prioritization criteria model. [Contribution] Besides a comprehensive overview of prioritization criteria discussed in the literature, this paper introduces a classification schema that allows researchers and practitioners to identify prioritization criteria and related literature in a time-saving manner.","authors":["Norman Riegel","Joerg Doerr"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-16101-3_22","Conference: International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality"],"references":["260155792_A_systematic_literature_review_of_software_requirements_prioritization_research","228756057_Procedures_for_Performing_Systematic_Reviews","221593598_Quest_for_a_Silver_Bullet_Creating_Software_Product_Value_through_Requirements_Selection","221440306_What_is_important_when_deciding_to_include_a_software_requirement_in_a_project_or_release","221222553_Requirements_Prioritization_Based_on_Benefit_and_Cost_Prediction_An_Agenda_for_Future_Research","300141601_An_Analysis_of_Priority-Based_Decision_Heuristics_for_Optimizing_Elicitation_Efficiency","257027892_A_Systematic_Review_of_Software_Requirements_Selection_and_Prioritization_Using_SBSE_Approaches","246198228_First_Things_First_Prioritizing_Requirements","223802781_Research_synthesis_in_software_engineering_A_tertiary_study","220610380_A_systematic_review_on_strategic_release_planning_models","220093396_Value-Oriented_Requirements_Prioritization_in_a_Small_Development_Organization","30499010_Evolving_Prioritization_for_Software_Product_Management"]}
