{"id":"348041512_Mejorando_la_comprension_de_las_clases_practicas_de_la_asignatura_Software_para_Robots_utilizando_YouTube","abstract":"In the subject ‘Software for Robots’ in the Bachelor´s Degree in Computer Science - Software Engineering, it was detected that the students had problems to understand the exercises that they had to do in the practical classes, and which count to the final mark. These exercises were well defined in a written way and were explained by the professor. However, some students misunderstood or mishandled them, which complicated those exercises. Therefore, it was requested and made a teaching innovation project to solve this problem. Videos were recorded, uploaded, and subtitled to YouTube. After this, the students were surveyed, and the videos statistics were studied. The videos allowed checking in the classroom that the students had less doubts and problems. The survey and statistics allowed checking that the students viewed the videos and that these helped to them. According to the students, the videos made a lot of difference as compared to the exercises without a video.","authors":["Cristian González García"],"meta":["December 2020","DOI:10.17993/3ctic.2020.94.45-65"],"references":["316938563_YouTube_Integration_in_Science_Classes_Understanding_Its_Roots_Ways_and_Selection_Criteria","314188769_MIDGAR_interoperabilidad_de_objetos_en_el_marco_de_Internet_de_las_Cosas_mediante_el_uso_de_Ingenieria_Dirigida_por_Modelos","307638707_A_review_about_Smart_Objects_Sensors_and_Actuators","262393281_How_video_production_affects_student_engagement_An_empirical_study_of_MOOC_videos","326123300_Enriching_Information_Technology_Course_Materials_by_Using_Youtube","324119590_Improving_Student_Assessment_of_a_Server_Administration_Course_Promoting_Flexibility_and_Competitiveness","307661895_Open_education_videos_in_the_classroom_exploring_the_opportunities_and_barriers_to_the_use_of_YouTube_in_teaching_introductory_sociology","265470376_Effects_of_different_video_lecture_types_on_sustained_attention_Emotion_cognitive_load_and_learning_performance","261456253_The_impact_of_YouTube_videos_on_the_student's_learning","254078849_YouTube_Video_Project_A_Cool_Way_to_Learn_Communication_Ethics","248701403_Screencast_Tutorials_Enhance_Student_Learning_of_Statistics","228349436_Multimedia_Teaching_with_Video_Clips_TV_Movies_YouTube_and_mtvU_in_the_College_Classroom","222407026_Instructional_video_in_e-learning_Assessing_the_impact_of_interactive_video_on_learning_effectiveness","234762246_Higher_Education_Migrates_to_YouTube_and_Social_Networks","232914028_YouTube_Educational_Potentials_and_Pitfalls"]}
