{"id":"314328349_Knowledge_Patterns","abstract":"Knowledge patterns are one way to formalize and describe lessons learned and best practices (i.e., proven experiences) about structuring knowledge, the design of KM systems, or the development of underlying ontologies. Such patterns capture aspects that positively or negatively influence the KM activities. In the later case, where negative influences are described, such patterns are denoted as anti-patterns. Knowledge patterns and anti patterns support practitioners and researchers in their knowledge management (KM) activities and can help in developing KM systems as well as improving the quality of the systems themselves and that of the knowledge within (i.e., the quality of the knowledge). Thereby, patterns in KM represent a way of structuring knowledge as well as a form of language that helps knowledge engineers to communicate about knowledge and KM systems.","authors":["JÃ¶rg Rech","Raimund L.
