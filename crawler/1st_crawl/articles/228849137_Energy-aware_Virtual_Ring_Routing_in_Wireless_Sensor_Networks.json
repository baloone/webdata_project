{"id":"228849137_Energy-aware_Virtual_Ring_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Virtual Ring Routing (VRR) is an ad-hoc routing protocol that avoids flooding the network. It uses location independent identifiers for packet routing. However, VRR does not take into consideration the amount of energy in nodes, leading to the failure of several nodes in the network. To resolve this problem, we have adopted a hierarchical Distributed Hash Table in the VRR architecture. In the resulting architecture, the energy powerful sensors are responsible for most message traffic. Weak sensors are then utilized less frequently than powerful sensors. The experimental results show that Coral-based VRR consumes less energy than VRR and extends the network lifetime.","authors":["Ghofrane Fersi","Wassef Louati","Maher Ben Jemaa"],"meta":["January 2011Network Protocols and Algorithms 2(4)","DOI:10.5296/npa.v2i4.494"],"references":["228943905_A_case_for_peer-to-peer_network_overlays_in_sensor_networks","221416205_Energy_Aware_Intra_Cluster_Routing_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221164420_Virtual_ring_routing_Network_routing_inspired_by_DHTs","220951735_APTEEN_A_Hybrid_Protocol_for_Efficient_Routing_and_Comprehensive_Information_Retrieval_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220948730_TEEN_ARouting_Protocol_for_Enhanced_Efficiency_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220747373_Virtual_Cord_Protocol_VCP_A_flexible_DHT-like_routing_service_for_sensor_networks","216545755_On_the_Lifetime_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3436000_Routing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","261355675_APTEEN_a_hybrid_protocol_for_efficient_routing_and_comprehensive_information_retrieval_in_wireless","224706194_Data-Centric_Routing_in_Sensor_Networks_Single-hop_Broadcast_or_Multi-hop_Unicast","224395120_Advantages_of_virtual_addressing_for_efficient_and_failure_tolerant_routing_in_sensor_networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","222702366_A_Survey_on_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220950595_Data_Gathering_in_SEnsor_Networks_using_the","220383731_An_Energy-Efficient_Communication_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","4143091_On_geographic_routing_without_location_information","3968599_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","3938183_Energy-efficient_communication_for_ad-hoc_wireless_sensor_networks","3864400_An_architecture_for_building_self-configurable_systems","2936681_Geographic_Routing_without_Location_Information","2901175_Sloppy_Hashing_and_Self-Organizing_Clusters","2555495_Data-Centric_Storage_in_Sensornets_with_GHT_a_Geographic_Hash_Table","2396065_An_Architecture_for_Building_Self-Configurable_Systems","2380265_Data_Gathering_in_Sensor_Networks_using_the_EnergyDelay_Metric","2380098_PEGASIS_Power-Efficient_Gathering_in_Sensor_Information_Systems_Stephanie_Lindsey_Cauligi_S_Raghavendra","2327596_GPSR_Greedy_Perimeter_Stateless_Routing_for_Wireless_Networks"]}
