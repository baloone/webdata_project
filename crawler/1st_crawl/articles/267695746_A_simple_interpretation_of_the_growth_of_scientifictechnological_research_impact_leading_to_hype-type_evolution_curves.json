{"id":"267695746_A_simple_interpretation_of_the_growth_of_scientifictechnological_research_impact_leading_to_hype-type_evolution_curves","abstract":"The empirical and theoretical justification of Gartner hype curves is a very\nrelevant open question in the field of Technological Life Cycle analysis. The\nscope of the present paper is to introduce a simple model describing the growth\nof scientific/technological research impact, in the specific case where science\nis the main source of a new idea driving a technological development, leading\nto hype-type evolution curves. The main idea of the model is that, in a first\nstage, the growth of the scientific interest of a new specific field (as can be\nmeasured by publication numbers) basically follows the classical logistic\ngrowth curve. At a second stage, starting at a later trigger time, the\ntechnological development based on that scientific idea (as can be measured by\npatent deposits) can be described as the integral (in a mathematical sense) of\nthe first curve, since technology is based on the overall accumulated\nscientific knowledge. The model is tested through a bibliometric analysis of\nthe publication and patent deposit rate for Organic Light Emitting Diodes\n(OLED) scientific research and technology, as well as for other emerging\ntechnologies.","authors":["Marco Campani","Ruggero Vaglio"],"meta":["October 2014Scientometrics 103(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-015-1533-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257663063_An_empirical_study_of_users'_hype_cycle_based_on_search_traffic_The_case_study_on_hybrid_cars","227271873_Modelling_the_Growth_of_Literature_in_the_Area_of_Theoretical_Population_Genetics","220021965_Population_Modeling_of_the_Emergence_and_Development_of_Scientific_Fields","3709830_Innovation_Forecasting","344724959_Science_Growth_and_Change","312428347_Science_Since_Babylon","284073219_Recherches_sur_la_loi_d'mathematics_accroissement_de_la_population","281389807_The_Linear_Model_of_Innovation_The_Historical_Construction_of_an_Analytical_Framework_Science","274453011_Science_Growth_and_Change","260282607_Little_Sciece_Big_Science","258865167_Invisible_Colleges_Diffusion_of_Knowledge_in_Scientific_Communities","256859378_Patent_and_publishing_activity_sequence_over_a_technology's_life_cycle","243486092_Science_Since_Babylon","240427375_Forecasting_emerging_technologies_Use_of_bibliometrics_and_patent_analysis","240209868_Recherches_math'_ematiques_sur_la_loi_d''accroissement_de_la_population_Nouveaux_m'_emoires_de_l","238832647_A_new_literature_growth_model_Variable_exponential_growth_law_of_literature","231188684_Literature_growth_and_decay_An_activation_analysis_resume","228379873_The_Linear_Model_of_Innovation","4722425_Patent_Statistics_As_Economic_Indicators_A_Survey","3406333_Observations_and_models_of_technology_trends_within_the_electronics_industry"]}
