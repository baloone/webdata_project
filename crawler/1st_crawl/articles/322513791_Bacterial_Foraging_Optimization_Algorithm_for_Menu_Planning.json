{"id":"322513791_Bacterial_Foraging_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Menu_Planning","abstract":"We propose a solution to the menu planning problem adapting the Bacterial Foraging-based Optimization Algorithm. We design a mathematical model which satisfies the nutritional needs of individuals while enforcing the “Laws of Nutrition”, a set of postulates used by virtually all nutrition scientists in Latin America. This model corresponds to a constrained numerical optimization problem. We design a Menu generator software prototype to set up a custom menu for 15 users with different characteristics. Results obtained by our proposal were satisfactory from an expert’s point of view.","authors":["Betania Hernández-Ocaña","Oscar Chávez-Bosquez","Juana Canul-Reich","Pilar Pozos"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794198"],"references":["300081866_Two-Swim_Operators_in_the_Modified_Bacterial_Foraging_Algorithm_for_the_Optimal_Synthesis_of_Four-Bar_Mechanisms","288992776_The_Latin_American_Laws_of_Correct_Nutrition_Review_Unified_Interpretation_Model_and_Tools","271348574_Application_of_Knowledge-Based_System_in_Personalized_Health_Management_Portal","269932529_Krause's_Food_the_Nutrition_Care_Process","315216987_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Based_Method_for_Personalized_Menu_Recommendations","312154255_Generating_eating_plans_for_athletes_using_the_particle_swarm_optimization","291178546_Modified_bacterial_foraging_optimization_for_engineering_design","285856879_An_efficient_constraint_handling_method_for_genetic_algorithms","277417456_Food_Track_Trace_ontology_for_helping_the_food_traceability_control","263699768_Good_food_preparation_practices_in_households_A_review"]}
