{"id":"263876836_Expectation_bubbles_in_a_spin_model_of_markets_Intermittency_from_frustration_across_scales","abstract":"A simple spin model is studied, motivated by the dynamics of traders in a market, where expectation bubbles and crashes occur. The dynamics is governed by interactions, which are frustrated across different scales: while ferromagnetic couplings connect each spin to its local neighborhood, an additional coupling relates each spin to the global magnetization. This new coupling is allowed to be anti-ferromagnetic. The resulting frustration causes a metastable dynamics with intermittency and phases of chaotic dynamics. The model reproduces main observations of real economic markets as power-law distributed returns and clustered volatility.","authors":["Stefan Bornholdt"],"meta":["November 2011International Journal of Modern Physics C 12(05)","DOI:10.1142/S0129183101001845","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259695552_Herd_behavior_and_aggregate_fluctuations_in_financial_markets","261004601_Power-laws_in_economy_and_finance_some_ideas_from_physics","247905301_Investment_rules_margin_and_market_volatility","247296341_Public_Regulation_of_Security_Markets","227389732_New_Approaches_to_Macroeconomic_Modeling","227078148_Thermometers_of_Speculative_Frenzy","222645465_Finite_market_size_as_a_source_of_extreme_wealth_inequality_and_market_instability","222544334_Speculative_bubbles_and_crashes_in_stock_markets_An_interacting-agent_model_of_speculative_activity","222394435_Stylized_facts_of_financial_markets_and_market_crashes_in_Minority_Games","46461933_A_generalized_spin_model_of_financial_markets","45122249_Volatility_Clustering_in_Financial_Markets_A_MicroSimulation_of_Interacting_Agents","24129852_Power_laws_in_economics_and_finance_some_ideas_from_physics","30834129_Artificial_Economic_Life_A_Simple_Model_of_a_Stockmarket","24102180_Public_Regulation_of_Security_Markets","24091390_Ants_Rationality_and_Recruitment"]}
