{"id":"309690111_Data-driven_Adaptive_Safety_Monitoring_Using_Virtual_Subjects_in_Medical_Cyber-Physical_Systems_A_Glucose_Control_Case_Study","abstract":"Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) integrate sensors, actuators, and software to improve patient safety and quality of healthcare. These systems introduce major challenges to safety analysis because the patientâ€™s physiology is complex, nonlinear, unobservable, and uncertain. To cope with the challenge that unidentified physiological parameters may exhibit short-term variances in certain clinical scenarios, we propose a novel run-time predictive safety monitoring technique that leverages a maximal model coupled with online training of a computational virtual subject (CVS) set. The proposed monitor predicts safety-critical events at run-time using only clinically available measurements. We apply the technique to a surgical glucose control case study. Evaluation on retrospective real clinical data shows that the algorithm achieves 96% sensitivity with a low average false alarm rate of 0.5 false alarm per surgery.","authors":["Sanjian Chen","Oleg Sokolsky","James Weimer","Insup Lee"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Computing Science and Engineering 10(3):75-84","DOI:10.5626/JCSE.2016.10.3.75"],"references":["229033936_Challenges_and_Research_Directions_in_Medical_Cyber-Physical_Systems","47385208_Diabetes_Models_Signals_and_Control","41418826_Closed-Loop_Artificial_Pancreas_Using_Subcutaneous_Glucose_Sensing_and_Insulin_Delivery_and_a_Model_Predictive_Control_Algorithm_Preliminary_Studies_in_Padova_and_Montpellier","311297691_Model-Based_Analysis_Of_User_Behaviors_In_Medical_Cyber-Physical_Systems","279221986_Performance_Evaluation_of_New-Generation_Pulse_Oximeters_in_the_NICU_Observational_Study","260832410_Diabetes_Models_Signals_and_Control","224965853_Stress-Induced_Hyperglycemia_as_a_Risk_Factor_for_Surgical-Site_Infection_in_Nondiabetic_Orthopedic_Trauma_Patients_Admitted_to_the_Intensive_Care_Unit","222259684_A_model_of_glucose_kinetics_and_their_control_by_insulin_compartmental_and_noncompartmental_approaches","51415520_A_simulation_model_of_glucose_regulation_in_the_critically_ill","47791658_Does_Stress-Induced_Hyperglycemia_Increase_the_Risk_of_Perioperative_Infectious_Complications_in_Orthopaedic_Trauma_Patients"]}
