{"id":"337556475_Ephemeral_Journalism_News_Distribution_Through_Instagram_Stories","abstract":"Social media are increasingly integrated into media routines as channels to gain access, verify and spread information. Likewise, as mobile news consumption is standardized, the media experiment with native formats for these platforms. This study analyzes how the media use Instagram Stories, to identify the strategies that they apply, as well as the adaptation and innovation features on this platform. A content analysis was conducted from a sample of 17 online media that use Instagram Stories, both legacy and digital native. The results show an upward potential in ephemeral news production, one that is increasingly developed and unique.","authors":["Jorge Vázquez Herrero","Sabela Direito-Rebollal","Xosé López García"],"meta":["November 2019Social Media + Society 5(4):1-13","DOI:10.1177/2056305119888657"],"references":["339932653_Audience_Participation_in_the_Production_of_Online_News","334444638_From_Participatory_Culture_to_Participatory_Fatigue_The_Problem_With_the_Public","332086752_Social_Media_and_Journalism_10_Years_Later_Untangling_Key_Assumptions","331230058_Conducting_Research_on_the_World's_Changing_Mediascape_Principles_and_Practices","329935273_Editorial_Comunicacion_innovacion_y_cambio_social_en_la_Red","327392908_News_Sources_and_JournalistSource_Interaction","326560797_Shared_views_Social_capital_community_ties_and_Instagram","326497648_Seven_Characteristics_Defining_Online_News_Formats_Towards_a_typology_of_online_news_and_live_blogs","346578873_Reviews_Ephemeral_Media_Transitory_Screen_Culture_from_Television_to_YouTube_Literary_Lost_Viewing_Television_through_the_Lens_of_Literature_Branding_Television_TV_Critics_and_Popular_Culture_A_Histor","335729582_News_From_the_Background_to_the_Foreground_How_People_Use_Technology_To_Manage_Media_Transitions_A_Study_of_Technology-mediated_News_Behaviors_in_a_Hyper-connected_World"]}
