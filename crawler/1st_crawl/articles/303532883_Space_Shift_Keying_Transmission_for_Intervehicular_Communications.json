{"id":"303532883_Space_Shift_Keying_Transmission_for_Intervehicular_Communications","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance of space shift keying (SSK) transmission over a generalized multiple scattering channel. This channel model provides a realistic statistical description of an intervehicular communication environment and includes as special cases the Rician, Rayleigh, and double-Rayleigh channels. We derive an accurate closed-form expression for the pairwise error probability of SSK, which is used to obtain the uncoded and coded error rate performances of SSK over various propagation scenarios. An asymptotic analysis for high values of the signal-to-noise ratio is carried out to determine the diversity and coding gains of the proposed system. The performance analysis reveals the impact of the number of receive antennas and the use of soft and hard decision decoding on the error rate performance of the SSK transmission over multiple scattering channels. Various numerically evaluated results accompanied by Monte Carlo simulations are presented to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed analysis.","authors":["K. Peppas","Petros S.
