{"id":"326965935_Impact_of_Credibility_on_Opinion_Analysis_in_Social_Media","abstract":"In conjunction with the rapid growth and adoption of social media, people are more and more willing to share their personal experiences and opinions about products and/or services with the community. Opinions could be the basis of developing systems that would advise future users on how to proceed with any purchase without risking any disappointment. Unfortunately, opinions are not always genuine due to for instance, biased users as well as mixed feedback coming from the same users (i.e., multi-identity). This paper presents an approach for opinion analysis using credibility as a decisive criterion for supporting future users make sound decisions. The effectiveness of this approach has been tested using opinions posted on Twitter.","authors":["Fatima Zohra Ennaji","Lobna Azaza","Zakaria Maamar","Abdelaziz El Fazziki"],"meta":["August 2018Fundamenta Informaticae 162(4):259-281","DOI:10.3233/FI-2018-1725","Projects: Political Communication on TwitterOpinion filtering in social networks"],"references":["327558265_Detecting_multiple_aliases_in_social_media","316666447_Sentiment_analysis_using_product_review_data","272088691_Comparing_Methods_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis","268806158_Identifying_Multiple_Userids_of_the_Same_Author","308962994_Graph_Tuple_Transformation","304480421_A_Generalized_Framework_for_Quantifying_Trust_of_Social_Media_Text_Documents","282304110_Measuring_Opinion_Credibility_in_Twitter","281050667_A_Fuzzy_Clustering-Based_Credibility_Model_for_Trust_Assessment_in_a_Service-Oriented_Architecture","275412246_Cyber_Hate_Speech_on_Twitter_An_Application_of_Machine_Classification_and_Statistical_Modeling_for_Policy_and_Decision_Making_Machine_Classification_of_Cyber_Hate_Speech","264006074_Creating_Social_Intelligence_for_Product_Portfolio_Design"]}
