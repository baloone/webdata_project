{"id":"337519762_Weibull_Cumulative_Distribution_based_real-time_response_and_performance_capacity_modeling_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_through_software_defined_networking","abstract":"Huge volumes of data are generated at rates faster than the speed of computing resources and executing processors available in market place. This anticipates a draft of information challenges associated with the performance capacity and the ability of big data processing systems to retort in real-time. Moreover, the elapsed time between probabilistic failures drops as the scale of information increases. An error occurred at a specific cluster node of a large Cyber–Physical System influences the overall computation requires to unfold big data transactions. Numerous failure characteristics, statistical response time and lifetime evaluation can be modeled through Weibull Distribution. In this paper, to scrutinize the latency for a data infrastructure, the three-parameter Weibull Cumulative Distribution is used through software defined networking in cyber–physical system. This speculation predicts that the shape of the response time distribution confide in the shape of the learning curve and depicts its parameters to the criterion of the input distribution.","authors":["Gifty R.","Bharathi R."],"meta":["November 2019Computer Communications 150(Pt 1)","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2019.11.018"],"references":["322934178_Comparative_Study_of_Different_Methods_for_Estimating_Weibull_Parameters_A_Case_Study_on_Jeju_Island_South_Korea","299545200_Cyber_Stealth_Attacks_in_Critical_Information_Infrastructures","270791467_A_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Platform_for_Studying_Low_Voltage_Residential_Networks","264418077_Statistical_Diagnosis_of_the_Best_Weibull_Methods_for_Wind_Power_Assessment_for_Agricultural_Application","234816926_NATE_N_etwork_Analysis_of_A_nomalous_T_raffic_E_vents_a_low-cost_approach","228934884_A_Survey_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems","49619420_Implementing_and_evaluating_the_nested_maximum_likelihood_estimation_technique","46061497_Effective_Analysis_of_Reaction_Time_Data","8358737_QMPE_estimating_Lognormal_Wald_And_Weibull_RT_distributions_with_a_parameter-dependent_lower_bound","8337675_A_comment_on_Heathcote_Brown_and_Mewhort's_QMLE_method_for_response_time_distributions","8090747_Fitting_distributions_using_maximum_likelihood_Methods_and_packages","7676894_A_hierarchical_model_for_estimating_response_time_distributions","4142473_On_the_statistical_distribution_of_processing_times_in_network_intrusion_detection","321256902_Securing_cyber_physical_systems_from_injection_attacks_by_exploiting_random_sequences","316496812_Using_Information-Flow_Methods_to_Analyze_the_Security_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems","313054427_A_Bayesian_approach_to_diffusion_models_of_decision-making_and_response_time","261162625_Security_analysis_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems_against_stealthy_deception_attacks","257017566_A_Consistent_Method_of_Estimation_For_The_Three-Parameter_Gamma_Distribution","252314205_Modelling_Estimation_and_Control_of_Networked_Complex_Systems","241926352_Extending_Statistics_of_Extremes_to_Distributions_Varying_in_Position_and_Scale_and_the_Implications_for_Race_Models","236215841_Survivability_Models_for_the_Assessment_of_Smart_Grid_Distribution_Automation_Network_Designs","223891971_Estimating_the_parameters_of_Weibull_distribution_using_simulated_annealing_algorithm","222898492_Pervan_G_Eight_key_issues_for_the_decision_support_systems_discipline_Decis_Support_Syst_443_657-672","24259621_Dispersion_of_Response_Times_Reveals_Cognitive_Dynamics","23789124_Comparing_time-accuracy_curves_Beyond_goodness-of-fit_measures","12347972_Stochastic_Dynamic_Models_of_Response_Time_and_Accuracy_A_Foundational_Primer","11544411_The_ex-Wald_distribution_as_a_descriptive_model_of_response_times","11052113_Estimating_parameters_of_the_diffusion_model_Approaches_to_dealing_with_contaminant_reaction_times_and_parameter_variability","6844447_Neural_Representation_of_Task_Difficulty_and_Decision_Making_during_Perceptual_Categorization_A_Timing_Diagram","5671868_Nearly_unbiased_estimators_for_the_three-parameter_Weibull_distribution_with_greater_efficiency_than_the_iterative_likelihood_method","3339352_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_in_the_3-parameter_Weibull_distribution_A_look_through_the_generalized_extreme-value_distribution","2549207_Analysis_of_Response_Time_Distributions"]}
