There are thirty respondents from Mahaphabkajadthong Autpatam School. The questionnaires are randomly assigned to students. The results indicate: 1) most of the Grade 9 students are satisfied with mobile learning in terms of appropriate content (Mean = 4.70, S.D. = 0.65) 2) the students have benefited from the use of mobile learning in terms of the sound aspect, especially the appropriateness of the song used in the lesson (Mean = 4.03, S.D. =0.89), and 3) the students are satisfied that the lesson could be reviewed at any time (Mean = 4.33, S.D. =0.66), so teachers and schools should put more energy and effort into developing the mobile learning content.","authors":["Supparang Ruangvanich","Prachyanun Nilsook"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3231848.3231878","Conference: the 2018 International Conference"],"references":["317266642_A_Web-based_Learning_System_using_Project-based_Learning_and_Imagineering","291206463_System_Design_of_Mobile_Augmented_Book","277822402_The_Challenges_of_Cloud_Computing_Management_Information_System_in_Academic_Work","276495709_Research_on_Undergraduate_Students'_Usage_Satisfaction_of_Mobile_Learning","273897590_The_Challenges_of_Cloud_Computing_Management_Information_System_in_Academic_Work","265164275_Article_IJIET_Model_for_Development_of_Mass_Communication_Technology_Graduates'_Desired_Characteristics_Based_on_Thai_Qualifications_Framework_for_Higher_Education","261143502_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Problem_Solving_Skill_Test_in_Robot_Programming_Using_Scaffolding_Tools","351454774_Undergraduate_students_in_research","312898876_2_theory_of_transactional_distance","273745597_Critical_Issues_To_Be_Concern_In_Selecting_Tools_For_Teaching_High_School_Computer_Project_Lesson_Using_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning","250700769_Relationships_Between_Interactions_and_Learning_In_Online_Environments","235258137_Critical_Issues_To_Be_Concern_In_Selecting_Tools_For_Teaching_High_School_Computer_Project_Lesson_Using_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning","216560673_Development_of_Web-based_Training_in_Collaboration_with_Convenors_of_Pilot_Colleges_under_the_Office_of_Vocational_Education_Commission","216560626_A_model_for_the_operation_of_one_college_one_innovation_project_the_office_of_vocational_education_commission","216560623_Web-based_Training_on_Knowledge_Management_for_Vocational_Teachers_in_Thailand"]}
