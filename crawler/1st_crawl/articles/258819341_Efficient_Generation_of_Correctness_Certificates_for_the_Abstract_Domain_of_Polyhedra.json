{"id":"258819341_Efficient_Generation_of_Correctness_Certificates_for_the_Abstract_Domain_of_Polyhedra","abstract":"Polyhedra form an established abstract domain for inferring runtime\nproperties of programs using abstract interpretation. Computations on\nthem need to be certified for the whole static analysis results to be\ntrusted. In this work, we look at how far we can get down the road of a\nposteriori verification to lower the overhead of certification of the\nabstract domain of polyhedra. We demonstrate methods for making the cost\nof inclusion certificate generation negligible. From a performance point\nof view, our single-representation, constraints-based implementation\ncompares with state-of-the-art implementations.","authors":["Alexis Fouilhé","David Monniaux","Michaël Périn"],"meta":["April 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_19","Conference: International Static Analysis Symposium"],"references":["301859593_Computing_Convex_Hulls_with_a_Linear_Solver","301859369_A_Static_Analyzer_for_Large_Safety-Critical_Software","229157172_PAGAI_A_path_sensitive_static_analyser","220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","220752122_A_static_analyzer_for_large_safety-critical_software","220643707_Programming_Pearl_Computing_convex_hulls_with_a_linear_solver","220484097_A_Static_Analyzer_for_Large_Safety-Critical_Software","43107739_Quantifier_Elimination_by_Lazy_Model_Enumeration","37794752_Formal_Verification_of_a_Realistic_Compiler","29611123_Result_certification_for_relational_program_analysis","24344484_On_Using_Floating-Point_Computations_to_Help_an_Exact_Linear_Arithmetic_Decision_Procedure","24014302_A_minimalistic_look_at_widening_operators","2534894_Automatic_Discovery_of_Linear_Restraints_Among_Variables_of_a_Program","319520250_The_Linear_Programming_Problem","251757178_Integrating_Simplex_with_DPLLT","225103229_APRON_A_Library_of_Numerical_Abstract_Domains_for_Static_Analysis","222403082_The_Parma_Polyhedra_Library_Toward_a_Complete_Set_of_Numerical_Abstractions_for_the_Analysis_and_Verification_of_Hardware_and_Software_Systems","221477450_Precise_Widening_Operators_for_Convex_Polyhedra","221477202_Exploiting_Sparsity_in_Polyhedral_Analysis","220805649_Proof_Generation_in_the_Touchstone_Theorem_Prover","1960886_Symbolic_Methods_to_Enhance_the_Precision_of_Numerical_Abstract_Domains"]}
