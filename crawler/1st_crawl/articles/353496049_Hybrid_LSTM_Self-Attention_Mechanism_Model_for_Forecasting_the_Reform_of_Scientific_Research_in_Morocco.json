{"id":"353496049_Hybrid_LSTM_Self-Attention_Mechanism_Model_for_Forecasting_the_Reform_of_Scientific_Research_in_Morocco","abstract":"Education is the cultivation of people to promote and guarantee the development of society. Education reforms can play a vital role in the development of a country. However, it is crucial to continually monitor the educational model's performance by forecasting the outcome's progress. Machine learning-based models are currently a hot topic in improving the forecasting research area. Forecasting models can help to analyse the impact of future outcomes by showing yearly trends. For this study, we developed a hybrid, forecasting time-series model by long short-term memory (LSTM) network and self-attention mechanism (SAM) to monitor Morocco's educational reform. We analysed six universities' performance and provided a prediction model to evaluate the best-performing university's performance after implementing the latest reform, i.e., from 2015-2030. We forecasted the six universities' research outcomes and tested our proposed methodology's accuracy against other time-series models. Results show that our model performs better for predicting research outcomes. e percentage increase in university performance after nine years is discussed to help predict the best-performing university. Our proposed algorithm accuracy and performance are better than other algorithms like LSTM and RNN.","authors":["Asmaa Fahim","Qingmei Tan","Mouna Mazzi","Md Sahabuddin"],"meta":["May 2021Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2021(1)","DOI:10.1155/2021/6689204"],"references":["349509323_Time_Series_Analysis_and_Forecasting_of_Air_Pollution_Particulate_Matter_PM_25_An_SARIMA_and_Factor_Analysis_Approach","341537255_A_Novel_Mutual_Fractional_Grey_Bernoulli_Model_With_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm_and_Its_Application_in_Education_Investment_Forecasting_in_China","341099006_Higher_Education_Institution_HEI_Enrollment_Forecasting_Using_Data_Mining_Technique","339956585_Learning_Analytics_Methods_Benefits_and_Challenges_in_Higher_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","339839345_Sustainable_Management_of_Digital_Transformation_in_Higher_Education_Global_Research_Trends","339130167_Investigating_Quality_Education_in_Moroccan_Educational","350474328_Automatic_Fetal_Ultrasound_Standard_Plane_Recognition_Based_on_Deep_Learning_and_IIoT","347811480_ED-ACNN_Novel_attention_convolutional_neural_network_based_on_encoder-decoder_framework_for_human_traffic_prediction","347435813_Fetal_cardiac_cycle_detection_in_multi-resource_echocardiograms_using_hybrid_classification_framework","338010912_Assessment_of_solar_energy_technologies_in_Africa-opportunities_and_challenges_in_meeting_the_2030_agenda_and_sustainable_development_goals"]}
