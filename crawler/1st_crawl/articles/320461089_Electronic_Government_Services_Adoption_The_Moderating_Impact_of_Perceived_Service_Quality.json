{"id":"320461089_Electronic_Government_Services_Adoption_The_Moderating_Impact_of_Perceived_Service_Quality","abstract":"This study investigated the moderating impact of perceived service quality on the positive relationship between perceived usefulness of e-government services and intention to use e-government services. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied as the theoretical foundation for the study. The research data collected was analyzed with SPSS while the graphical representation of the moderating effect was generated using the software known as Interaction version 1.7.2211. The results have demonstrated that perceived service quality of e-government services does not have any significant moderating effect on the positive relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to use e-government services. However, perceived service quality and perceived usefulness of e-government services were found to be positively significant in influencing the intention to use e-government services. The implications of this study are further discussed.","authors":["Isaac Kofi Mensah","Jianing Mi"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Electronic Government Research 13(3):38-54","DOI:10.4018/IJEGR.2017070103"],"references":["316242474_Factors_Influencing_Citizens'_Intention_to_Use_E-Government_Services_A_Case_Study_of_South_Korean_Students_in_China","310572809_Online_Tax_Filing-E-Government_Service_Adoption_Case_of_Vietnam","300337685_Factors_affecting_the_intention_to_use_e-Government_services","297600685_The_Effects_of_Perceived_Usefulness_and_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_on_Continuance_Intention_to_Use_E-Government","295871477_Citizen_Adoption_of_E-Government_Services_Exploring_Citizen_Perceptions_of_Online_Services_in_the_US_and_UK","289231768_The_relationship_between_perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_of_use_perceived_information_quality_and_intention_to_use_E-government","282862861_E-government_success_factors_A_perspective_on_government_units","280208691_Discovering_Citizens_Reaction_Toward_E-Government_Factors_in_E-Government_Adoption","277667693_E-Government_Adoption_in_Jordan_The_Influence_of_Age","277392418_Perceived_e-service_quality_PeSQ","267711021_User_Acceptance_of_the_E-Government_Services_in_Malaysia_Structural_Equation_Modelling_Approach","263523474_Services_Marketing_People_Technology_Strategy_7th_edition","263063802_Key_issues_and_challenges_in_e-government_development_An_integrative_case_study_of_the_number_one_eCity_in_the_Arab_world","263044151_Analysing_challenges_barriers_and_CSF_of_egov_adoption","262360226_Service_Quality_between_e-Government_Users_and_Administrators","261110637_E-government_application_at_the_regional_level_in_Poland_-_The_case_of_SEKAP","258158801_E-S-Qual_A_Multiple-Item_Scale_for_Assessing_Electronic_Service_Quality","240258500_Measuring_e-government_service_value_with_the_E-GOVSQUAL-RISK_model","235310754_Defining_and_Measuring_the_Quality_of_Customer_Service","235307489_Towards_quality_e-service_in_the_public_sector_The_evolution_of_web_sites_in_the_local_public_service_sector","233897090_Belief_attitude_intention_and_behaviour_An_introduction_to_theory_and_research","233522386_A_Service_Quality_Model_and_Its_Marketing_Implications","228850900_A_General_Framework_for_E-Government_Definition_Maturity_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Success","228796407_Factors_for_Successful_E-government_Adoption_A_Conceptual_Framework","227447282_A_Theoretical_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_Four_Longitudinal_Field_Studies","225427196_Service_Quality_Delivery_Through_Web_Sites_A_Critical_Review_of_Extant_Knowledge","225083621_Measuring_Service_Quality_-_A_Reexamination_And_Extension","221560954_A_Multiple-Item_Scale_for_Assessing_E-Government_Service_Quality","221178488_The_Use_of_the_UTAUT_Model_in_the_Adoption_of_E-Government_Services_in_Kuwait","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","317156514_The_adoption_of_M-government_services_from_the_user's_perspectives_Empirical_evidence_from_the_United_Arab_Emirates","306221129_Citizen_perceptions_of_e-government_in_the_Kurdistan_Region_of_Iraq","303266539_E-government_challenges_and_opportunities_A_case_study_of_Jordan","292684424_Adoption_and_use_of_E-Government_services_The_case_of_Romania","277642893_Adoption_of_e-government_services_The_role_of_service_quality_dimensions_and_demographic_variables","247507589_Measuring_service_quality_in_the_public_sector_The_potential_for_SERVQUAL","242348880_SERVQUAL_revisited_A_critical_review_of_service_quality","235362849_A_Diffusion_of_Innovations","235306027_E-service_quality_A_model_of_virtual_service_quality_dimensions","233580738_Consumer_perceptions_of_e-Service_quality_in_online_shopping","227504323_Consequences_of_Web-based_service_quality_Uncovering_a_multi-faceted_chain_of_effects","224686851_Investigating_Factors_Affecting_the_Adoption_of_Electronic_Toll_Collection_A_Transaction_Cost_Economics_Perspective","224568171_E-S-QUAL_Its_Applicability_in_Evaluating_E-government_Web_Sites_Service_Quality","222544401_Developing_and_Validating_an_Instrument_for_Measuring_User-Perceived_Web_Quality","221407412_Evaluating_WAP_news_sites_The_WebQualm_approach","220672255_The_effect_of_critical_success_factors_on_IT_governance_performance","220420107_Measuring_consumer_satisfaction_in_internet_banking_A_core_framework","220393022_e-Government_Information_Systems_Evaluation-Led_Design_for_Public_Value_and_Client_Trust","220356712_The_Utilization_of_E-Government_Services_Citizen_Trust_Innovation_and_Acceptance_Factors","220207758_E-Government_Evolution_in_EU_Local_Governments_A_Comparative_Perspective","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","46431783_Customer_adoption_of_e-service_an_experimental_study","215666003_Discovering_statistics_using_IBM_SPSS_Statistics_And_sex_and_drugs_and_rock'n'roll"]}
