{"id":"325748669_Web_Based_Application_for_Decision_Support_System_with_ELECTRE_Method","abstract":"Decision Support System is a system commonly used to assist management in assisting decision-making in top managerial sections, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is one of many decision-making methods that can be used to select the best alternative from a number of alternatives based on certain criteria, one of the methods that can be utilized is the Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite (ELECTRE) method that works based on the concept of outranking using pairwise comparisons of each alternative based on appropriate criteria, this paper applies the ELECTRE method in a web based application that can be employed for input and output dynamic for alternative, criteria, user values and also a fast ranking process, the choice of web based application because there is many research about decision support system but only few that applied to application, and this research tries to applied ELECTRE method to web based application.","authors":["Ahmad Yanie","Abdurrozaq Hasibuan","I Ishak","M Marsono"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1028(1):012054","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012054"],"references":["330602733_A_decision_support_system_for_multiple_criteria_alternative_ranking_using_TOPSIS_and_VIKOR_in_fuzzy_and_nonfuzzy_environments","321801771_Forecasting_Error_Calculation_with_Mean_Absolute_Deviation_and_Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error","321799147_Research_of_Simple_Multi-Attribute_Rating_Technique_for_Decision_Support","319059290_Technical_Approach_of_TOPSIS_in_Decision_Making","316643313_Composite_Performance_Index_for_Student_Admission","316643310_Composite_Performance_Index_for_Student_Admission","316470807_Study_Approach_of_Simple_Additive_Weighting_For_Decision_Support_System","315729858_Study_Approach_Technique_for_Order_of_Preference_by_Similarity_to_Ideal_Solution_TOPSIS","314952722_Decision_Support_System_Best_Employee_Assessments_with_Technique_for_Order_of_Preference_by_Similarity_to_Ideal_Solution","321717567_Influence_of_the_Cooling_Environment_on_Cutting_Temperature_and_Specific_Energy_when_Turning_AISI_4340_Steel","313316006_Implementation_of_Elimination_and_Choice_Expressing_Reality_ELECTRE_Method_in_Selecting_the_Best_Lecturer_Case_Study_STMIK_BUDI_DARMA","311986644_Study_of_the_Simple_Multi-Attribute_Rating_Technique_For_Decision_Support","311985630_Decision_Support_System_in_Selecting_The_Appropriate_Laptop_Using_Simple_Additive_Weighting","280105815_ELECTRE_A_comprehensive_literature_review_on_methodologies_and_applications","257479128_Sustainable_concept_selection_using_ELECTRE"]}
