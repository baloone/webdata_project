{"id":"306942686_Quantum_Kernels_for_Unattributed_Graphs_using_Discrete-time_Quantum_Walks","abstract":"In this paper, we develop a new family of graph kernels where the graph structure is probed by means\nof a discrete-time quantum walk. Given a pair of graphs, we let a quantum walk evolve on each graph\nand compute a density matrix with each walk. With the density matrices for the pair of graphs to hand,\nthe kernel between the graphs is defined as the negative exponential of the quantum Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence between their density matrices. In order to cope with large graph structures, we propose\nto construct a sparser version of the original graphs using the simplification method introduced in Qiu\nand Hancock (2007). To this end, we compute the minimum spanning tree over the commute time\nmatrix of a graph. This spanning tree representation minimizes the number of edges of the original\ngraph while preserving most of its structural information. The kernel between two graphs is then\ncomputed on their respective minimum spanning trees. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nkernels on several standard graph datasets and we demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency.","authors":["Lu Bai","Luca Rossi","Lixin Cui","Zhihong Zhang"],"meta":["February 2017Pattern Recognition Letters 87","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2016.08.019"],"references":["273127551_Measuring_graph_similarity_through_continuous-time_quantum_walks_and_the_quantum_Jensen-Shannon_divergence","264046371_A_Hypergraph_Kernel_from_Isomorphism_Tests","245023036_Attributed_Graph_Similarity_from_the_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","236681650_A_Continuous-Time_Quantum_Walk_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","221651711_Symbolic_Learning_vs_Graph_Kernels_An_Experimental_Comparison_in_a_Chemical_Application","221497506_On_Graph_Kernels_Hardness_Results_and_Efficient_Alternatives","221345917_Marginalized_Kernels_Between_Labeled_Graphs","221292958_3D_Shape_Matching_through_Topological_Structures","51189923_Emmert_Streib_F_Dehmer_M_May_2011_Networks_for_systems_biology_conceptual_connection_of_data_and_function_IET_Syst_Biol","48925057_Graph_Kernels","1904243_Graph_kernels_between_point_clouds","308145624_A_time_series_kernel_for_action_recognition","280839215_Fast_Depth-Based_Subgraph_Kernels_for_Unattributed_Graphs","264046382_Attributed_Graph_Kernels_Using_the_Jensen-Tsallis_q-Differences","262524617_A_long_trip_in_the_charming_world_of_graphs_for_Pattern_Recognition","262168327_Directed_Acyclic_Graph_Kernels_for_Action_Recognition","261794925_3D_Shape_retrieval_and_classification_using_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_on_Extended_Reeb_Graphs","261357339_A_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Graph_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","260707708_Backtrackless_Walks_on_a_Graph","236110992_Graph_Kernels_from_the_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","228929800_Weisfeiler-Lehman_Graph_Kernels","225809205_Quantum_walks_Ihara_zeta_functions_and_cospectrality_in_regular_graphs","222579674_Coined_quantum_walks_lift_the_cospectrality_of_graphs_and_trees","222143248_Graph_simplification_and_matching_using_commute_times","220520102_A_Survey_of_Kernels_for_Structured_Data","213878721_Shortest_Connection_Networks_And_Some_Generalizations","49646228_Graph_Characterization_via_Ihara_Coefficients","4207736_Shortest-Path_Kernels_on_Graphs","2202218_Quantum_Computation_and_Decision_Trees"]}
