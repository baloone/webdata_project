These two\ntopics are related with cryptography and cryptography is an\nextension of cryptology and cryptanalysis. The purpose of this\npaper is that to compare the time taken to build a hash as well\nas it also compares the bit rate passes through a hash value.\nHere we are going to perform a deep analysis for these two\nalgorithms.","authors":["Sandeep Kumar","Er Piyush Gupta"],"meta":["June 2014International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science 5(3):4492 - 4495"],"references":["260671955_Architecture_based_on_MD5_and_MD5-512_Bit_Applications","258650505_New_modified_256-bit_MD5_Algorithm_with_SHA_Compression_Function","242391317_The_MD5_Message-digest_Algorithm"]}
