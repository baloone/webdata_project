{"id":"224794260_A_Context_Modeling_Survey","abstract":"Context-awareness is one of the drivers of the ubiquitous computing paradigm, whereas a well designed model is a key accessor to the context in any context-aware system. This paper provides a survey of the the most relevant current approaches to modeling context for ubiquitous computing. Numerous approaches are reviewed, classified relative to their core elements and evaluated with respect to their appropriateness for ubiquitous computing.","authors":["Thomas Strang","Claudia Linnhoff-Popien"],"meta":["September 2004","SourceDLR","Conference: First International Workshop on Advanced Context Modelling, Reasoning And Management at UbiComp 2004, Nottingham, England, September 7, 2004"],"references":["225007916_CoOL_A_Context_Ontology_Language_to_Enable_Contextual_Interoperability","224794151_Applications_of_a_Context_Ontology_Language","220973464_CAPEUS_An_Architecture_for_Context-Aware_Selection_and_Execution_of_Services","246410760_Identification_and_Modeling_of_Contexts_for_Dierent_Information_Scenarios_in_Air_Trac","242442283_Enabling_Knowledge_Sharing_and_Reuse_on_the_Semantic_Web","239451750_Centaurus_A_Framework_for_Indoor_Mobile_Services","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","230745463_Situations_and_Attitudes","224794149_Highlevel_Service_Handover_through_a_Contextual_Framework","222499164_Design_of_an_object_model_for_a_context_sensitive_tourist_GUIDE"]}
