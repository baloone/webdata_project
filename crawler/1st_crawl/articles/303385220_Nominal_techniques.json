{"id":"303385220_Nominal_techniques","abstract":"Programming languages abound with features making use of names in various ways. There is a mathematical foundation for the semantics of such features which uses groups of permutations of names and the notion of the support of an object with respect to the action of such a group. The relevance of this kind of mathematics for the semantics of names is perhaps not immediately obvious. That it is relevant and useful has emerged over the last 15 years or so in a body of work that has acquired its own name: nominal techniques. At the same time, the application of these techniques has broadened from semantics to computation theory in general. This article introduces the subject and is based upon a tutorial at LICS-ICALP 2015 [Pitts 2015a].","authors":["Andrew Pitts"],"meta":["February 2016ACM SIGLOG News 3(1)","DOI:10.1145/2893582.2893594"],"references":["291356343_Dependent_Types_for_Nominal_Terms_with_Atom_Substitutions","275412019_A_Dependent_Type_Theory_with_Abstractable_Names","258278907_Nominal_Coalgebraic_Data_Types_with_Applications_to_Lambda_Calculus","238702394_Nominal_SOS","235171825_Semantic_Domains_and_Denotational_Semantics","222700699_Fresh_O'Caml_Nominal_Abstract_Syntax_for_the_Masses","221663251_A_dependent_nominal_type_theory","221557852_Nominal_Domain_Theory_for_Concurrency","220997191_Fresh-Register_Automata","220897586_Domains_for_Denotational_Semantics","220689159_Model_Checking","319394252_Introduction_to_Higher-Order_Categorical_Logic","309738720_Cubical_Type_Theory_a_constructive_interpretation_of_the_univalence_axiom","308740059_Names_and_Symmetry_in_Computer_Science_Invited_Tutorial","303384972_Nominal_Presentation_of_Cubical_Sets_Models_of_Type_Theory","285910634_A_model_of_type_theory_in_cubical_sets","284495777_Uber_die_Unabhangigkeit_des_Wohlordnungssatzes_vom_Ordnungsprinzip","284396724_Der_Begriff_definit_und_die_Unabhangigkeit_des_Auswahlaxioms","280986928_Denotational_Semantics_with_Nominal_Scott_Domains","270956456_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Parts_I_and_II","269023832_Towards_Nominal_Abramsky","268066759_Automata_theory_in_nominal_sets","266436752_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_4th_corrected_printing","265779242_Nominal_sets_Names_and_symmetry_in_computer_science","265670140_Topology_via_Logic","265424019_An_Introduction_to_Higher_Order_Categorical_Logic","265414880_An_Algebraic_Weak_Factorisation_System_on_01-Substitution_Sets_A_Constructive_Proof","261165150_Turing_Machines_with_Atoms","250400155_Alpha-Structural_Recursion_and_Induction_Extended_Abstract","248390634_Universal_graphs_and_universal_functions","247686551_Swapping_the_atom_Programming_with_binders_in_Fresh_O''Caml","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","242411942_Name-passing_process_calculi_operational_models_and_structural_operational_semantics","242281260_Names_and_Binding_in_Type_Theory","234780570_Initial_Algebra_Semantics_and_Continuous_Algebras","228622477_The_calculus_of_nominal_inductive_constructions_an_intensional_approach_to_encoding_name-bindings","227020474_Nominal_techniques_in_IsabelleHOL","225329587_p-Calculus_Structured_Coalgebras_and_Minimal_HD-Automata","223657338_LCF_considered_as_a_programming_language","222940685_Finite-Memory_Automata","222824330_Structured_coalgebras_and_minimal_HD-automata_for_the_-calculus","222683465_Nominal_Unification","222429477_On_a_monadic_semantics_for_freshness","221570164_Freshness_and_Name-Restriction_in_Sets_of_Traces_with_Names","221570162_Completeness_for_Algebraic_Theories_of_Local_State","221558050_A_Dependent_Type_Theory_with_Names_and_Binding","221442922_Domain_Theory_in_Logical_Form","221336521_Nominal_rewriting_systems","220997519_Towards_Nominal_Computation","220805953_Nominal_techniques_in_IsabelleHOL","220606897_About_permutation_algebras_presheaves_and_named_sets","220395216_Domain_Theory_in_Logical_Form","220369149_Nominal_Reasoning_Techniques_in_Coq","220432321_Alpha-Structural_Recursion_and_Induction","220366268_Foundations_of_Nominal_Techniques_Logic_and_Semantics_of_Variables_in_Abstract_Syntax"]}
