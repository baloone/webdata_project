{"id":"226977057_A_Generalized_Erdos-Renyi_Law_for_Sequence_Analysis_Problems","abstract":"We consider a class of random variables that includes scoring functions arising in computational molecular biology, such as sequence alignment and folding. We characterize the class by a set of properties, and show that, under certain conditions, such random variables follow an Erds-Rnyi law of large numbers. That is, \n\n\\text2\\text + limn ® ¥ \\fracTn logn = sd\\text a\\text.s\\text. \\begin{gathered} _{\\text{2}}^{\\text{ + }} \\hfill \\\\ \\hfill \\\\ \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } \\frac{{T_n }}{{\\log n}} = sd{\\text{ a}}{\\text{.s}}{\\text{.}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} \nwhere Tn is the maximum score over contiguous regions from each of s independent sequences, and d is a function of the large deviation rate of the scoring function. This result unifies several others, and applies to more general scoring systems on any number of sequences. We show how the theorem can be applied to a recently introduced scoring function. Finally, we conjecture that a modified form of this function behaves similarly, and support the conjecture with simulations.","authors":["Laurie Heyer"],"meta":["September 2000Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability 2(3):309-329","DOI:10.1023/A:1010085313469"],"references":["225418075_Algorithm_Independent_Properties_of_RNA_Structure_Prediction","38359394_Statistical_Composition_of_High-Scoring_Segments_from_Molecular_Sequences","38357601_A_Poisson_Approximation_for_Sequence_Comparisons_with_Insertions_and_Deletions","20923774_Basic_Local_Aligment_Search_Tool","20841406_Methods_for_Assessing_the_Statistical_Significance_of_Molecular_Sequence_Features_by_Using_General_Scoring_Schemes","20422529_A_tool_for_multiple_sequence_alignment","14458256_Local_Alignment_Statistics","13941134_Finding_the_Most_Significant_Common_Sequence_and_Structure_Motifs_in_a_set_of_RNA_Sequences","12531660_Rapid_Assessment_of_Extremal_Statistics_for_Gapped_Local_Alignment","284653201_An_efficient_method_applicable_to_the_search_for_similarities_in_the_amino_acid_sequences_of_two_proteins","277503531_Longest_Common_Subsequences_of_Two_Random_Sequences","254913404_Secondary_Structure_of_Single-Stranded_Nucleic_Acidst","243638533_Maximum-likelihood_Estimation_of_the_Statistical_Distribution_of_SmithWaterman_Local_Sequence_Similarity_Scores","239665626_Probability_theory_and_combinatorial_optimization","238831754_Simultaneous_Solution_of_the_RNA_Folding_Alignment_and_Protosequence_Problems","228057969_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences","226506800_On_a_new_law_of_large_numbers","225972825_Maximum-likelihood_estimation_of_the_statistical_distribution_of_Smith-Waterman_local_sequence_similarity_scores","222483053_A_Phase_Transition_for_the_Minimum_Free_Energy_of_Secondary_Structures_of_a_Random_RNA","38363081_Sequence_Comparison_Significance_and_Poisson_Approximation","38362874_A_Phase_Transition_for_the_Score_in_Matching_Random_Sequences_Allowing_Deletions","38362770_A_Limit_Theorem_for_Matching_Random_Sequences_Allowing_Deletions","38362645_Subadditive_Ergodic_Theory","38361426_Critical_Phenomena_in_Sequence_Matching","17025702_Fast_Algorithm_for_Predicting_the_Secondary_Structure_of_Single_Stranded_RNA","15934339_Identification_of_Common_Molecular_Subsequences","2637333_Limit_Distribution_Of_Maximal_Non-Aligned_Two-Sequence_Segmental_Score","2622930_Critical_Phenomena_for_Sequence_Matching_with_Scoring"]}
