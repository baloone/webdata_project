{"id":"316029838_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_Without_Learning_the_Machinery","abstract":"Machine learning is a pervasive development at the intersection of statistics and computer science. While it can benefit many data-related applications, the technical nature of the research literature and the corresponding algorithms slows down its adoption. Scikit-learn is an open-source software project that aims at making machine learning accessible to all, whether it be in academia or in industry. It benefits from the general-purpose Python language, which is both broadly adopted in the scientific world, and supported by a thriving ecosystem of contributors. Here we give a quick introduction to scikit-learn as well as to machine-learning basics.","authors":["Gael Varoquaux","L. Buitinck","Gilles Louppe","O.
