{"id":"311442714_Power_generation_of_solar_PV_systems_in_Palestine","abstract":"In Palestine, the electric power generated is not enough to meet the power demand of domestic and industrial sectors. In this article, a PV system of 220 kW peak was proposed as a renewable resource of power generation for grid connected applications in residential quarter in north Palestine. The proposed system was simulated using MATLAB solver, in which the input parameters for the solver were the meteorological data for the selected location and the size of PV panels. Results showed that it is possible for Palestine to use the solar energy to generate enough power for some villages or rural area. It is also possible to use such a system as a black start source of power during total shutdown time. Results also indicated that solar PV systems can be more economical than grid electricity.","authors":["Emad Natsheh"],"meta":["July 2016Applied Solar Energy 52(3):193-196","DOI:10.3103/S0003701X16030105"],"references":["263687004_Climate-based_empirical_model_for_PV_module_temperature_estimation_in_tropical_environment","224397300_Comprehensive_Approach_to_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Photovoltaic_Arrays","3270653_Comparison_of_Photovoltaic_Array_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_Techniques","276902757_Analyzing_the_effect_of_desert_environment_on_the_performance_of_photovoltaics","274713423_An_automated_tool_for_solar_power_systems","239369460_Parametric_study_of_hybrid_wind-solar-diesel_power_systems","222819123_Weather_data_and_analysis_of_hybrid_photovoltaic-wind_power_generation_systems_adapted_to_a_seawater_greenhouse_desalination_unit_designed_for_arid_coastal_countries","222673261_Photovoltaics_Life-cycle_analyses","222574967_Electricity_generation_of_hybrid_PVwind_systems_in_Iraq","222287332_Hybrid_solarwind_power_system_probabilistic_modeling_for_long-term_performance_assessment"]}
