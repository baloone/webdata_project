{"id":"347303596_Some_new_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_coordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","abstract":"In this article, by using the notion of newly defined q1q2 derivatives and integrals, some new Simpson's type inequalities for coordinated convex functions are proved. The outcomes raised in this paper are extensions and generalizations of the comparable results in the literature on Simpson's inequalities for coordinated convex functions.","authors":["Muhammad Aamir Ali","Hüseyin Budak","Zhiyue Zhang","Hüseyin Yildirim"],"meta":["April 2021Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences 44(6)","DOI:10.1002/mma.7048"],"references":["344166446_Some_New_Newton's_Type_Integral_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_in_Quantum_Calculus","343071701_Simpson_and_Newton_type_inequalities_for_convex_functions_via_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","343049408_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_Like_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions","333652827_Simpson's_Type_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_on_Quantum_Calculus","333619354_QUANTUM_HERMITE-HADAMARD_TYPE_INEQUALITY_AND_SOME_ESTIMATES_OF_QUANTUM_MIDPOINT_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_DOUBLE_INTEGRALS","330905703_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Quasi-Convex_Functions","329814922_HERMITE_HADAMARD'S_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_CO-ORDINATED_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS_ON_QUANTUM_INTEGRAL","308912178_q-Hermite_Hadamard_inequalities_and_quantum_estimates_for_midpoint_type_inequalities_via_convex_and_quasi-convex_functions","305888398_Some_q-analogues_of_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_of_functions_of_two_variables_on_finite_rectangles_in_the_plane","339281527_On_q-Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_general_convex_functions","281759795_Quantum_integral_inequalities_for_convex_functions","280831870_Some_quantum_integral_inequalities_via_preinvex_functions","279212634_On_new_inequalities_of_Simpson's_type_for_generalized_convex_functions","274693941_Quantum_integral_inequalities_on_finite_intervals","289824801_On_new_inequalities_of_Simpson's_type_for_Quasi-Convex_functions_with_applications"]}
