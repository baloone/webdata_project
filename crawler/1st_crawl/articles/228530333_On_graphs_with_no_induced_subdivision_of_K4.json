{"id":"228530333_On_graphs_with_no_induced_subdivision_of_K4","abstract":"We prove a decomposition theorem for graphs that do not contain a subdi-vision of K 4 as an induced subgraph where K 4 is the complete graph on four vertices. We obtain also a structure theorem for the class C of graphs that contain neither a subdivision of K 4 nor a wheel as an induced subgraph, where a wheel is a cycle on at least four vertices together with a vertex that has at least three neighbors on the cycle. Our structure theorem is used to prove that every graph in C is 3-colorable and entails a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for membership in C. As an intermediate result, we prove a structure theorem for the graphs whose cycles are all chordless.","authors":["Benjamin Lévêque","Frédéric Maffray","Nicolas Trotignon"],"meta":["February 2010Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 102(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2012.04.005"],"references":["28135867_The_Strong_Perfect_Graph_Theorem","313052083_The_recognition_of_series_parallel_digraphs","312625792_The_recognition_of_series_parallel_digraphs","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","267466546_A_maxmn_algorithm_for_determining_the_graph_H_from_its_line_graph_G","245008597_A_Property_of_4-Chromatic_Graphs_and_Some_Remarks_on_Critical_Graphs","242910830_Induced_Trees_in_Graphs_of_Large_Chromatic_Number","239641908_Topology_of_Series-Parallel_Networks","232619217_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms","230815152_Triangle-free_intersection_graphs_of_line_segments_with_large_chromaticnumber","227527073_A_Structure_Theorem_for_Graphs_with_No_Cycle_with_a_Unique_Chord_and_Its_Consequences","226657991_Induced_Subdivisions_In_K_ss-Free_Graphs_of_Large_Average_Degree","226258132_On_Colouring_the_Nodes_of_a_Network","223118002_Decomposition_by_clique_separators","222422356_Detecting_induced_subgraphs","221591784_The_Recognition_of_Series_Parallel_Digraphs","220616517_Dividing_a_Graph_into_Triconnected_Components","220441913_Colouring_series-parallel_graphs","220430847_An_Optimal_Algorithm_to_Detect_a_Line_Graph_and_Output_Its_Root_Graph","220114925_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_Clique_Cut-Sets","220076228_Graphs_without_odd_holes_parachutes_or_proper_wheels_A_generalization_of_Meyniel_graphs_and_of_line_graphs_of_bipartite_graphs","220076101_Claw-free_graphs_IV_Decomposition_theorem","213894633_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms"]}
