{"id":"339935331_Multivariate_Analysis_of_Orthogonal_Range_Searching_and_Graph_Distances","abstract":"We show that the eccentricities, diameter, radius, and Wiener index of an undirected n-vertex graph with nonnegative edge lengths can be computed in time \\(O(n\\cdot \\left( {\\begin{array}{c}k+\\lceil \\log n\\rceil \\\\ k\\end{array}}\\right) \\cdot 2^k \\log n)\\), where k is linear in the treewidth of the graph. For every \\(\\epsilon >0\\), this bound is \\(n^{1+\\epsilon }\\exp O(k)\\), which matches a hardness result of Abboud et al. (in: Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch28) and closes an open problem in the multivariate analysis of polynomial-time computation. To this end, we show that the analysis of an algorithm of Cabello and Knauer (Comput Geom 42:815–824, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2009.02.001) in the regime of non-constant treewidth can be improved by revisiting the analysis of orthogonal range searching, improving bounds of the form \\(\\log ^d n\\) to \\(\\left( {\\begin{array}{c}d+\\lceil \\log n\\rceil \\\\ d\\end{array}}\\right)\\), as originally observed by Monier (J Algorithms 1:60–74, 1980. https://doi.org/10.1016/0196-6774(80)90005-X). We also investigate the parameterization by vertex cover number.","authors":["Karl Bringmann","Thore Husfeldt","Måns Magnusson"],"meta":["August 2020Algorithmica 82(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-020-00680-z"],"references":["333225688_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Diameter","323443995_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Diameter","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","303754470_A_ckn_5-APPROXIMATION_ALGORITHM_FOR_TREEWIDTH","277895669_Approximation_and_Fixed_Parameter_Subquadratic_Algorithms_for_Radius_and_Diameter","262281728_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_the_diameter_and_radius_of_sparse_graphs","249375109_All-Pairs_Shortest_Paths_with_Real_Weights_in_O_n_3log_n_Time","234810826_Quintary_Trees_A_File_Structure_for_Multidimensional_Database_Systems","222673286_Vertex_Cover_Further_Observations_and_Further_Improvements","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity"]}
