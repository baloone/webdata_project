{"id":"259574043_Direct_Adaptive_Feedback_Linearization_for_Quadrotor_Control","abstract":"Quadrotor control poses a unique set of challenges due to its small size, complex aerodynamics and highly nonlinear plant. In an effort to accurately control such platforms, feedback linearization has been presented as a technique that enables the quadrotor to fly in a large flight envelope. Since exact cancellation of nonlinear dynamics, as required by feedback linearization, is difficult in practice, this work derives a direct nonlinear adaptive control method. The method is proven to be asymptotically stable using an argument based on the Lyapunov theory. The controller is shown to be effective at tracking aggressive non-linear trajectories using a comprehensive nonlinear model of a quadrotor helicopter. It is also shown to be robust to initial parameter errors, random changes in parameters during flight and external disturbances","authors":["Prasenjit Mukherjee","Steven L.
