{"id":"247077215_Optimized_Timing_Attacks_Against_Public_Key_Cryptosystems","abstract":"Timing attacks represent a serious threat which has to be considered when implementing public key cryptosystems. The basic idea of any timing attack is to determine a secret parameter from differences in running times needed for various input values. We treat two variants of timing attacks introduced by P. Kocher et al. [Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 1109, 104-113 (19986)] and J.-F. Dhem et al. [ibid. 1820, 175-191 (2000)]. We weaken assumptions, specify the respective mathematical models, and optimize these attacks. For this, we apply statistical decision theory.","authors":["Werner Schindler"],"meta":["January 2002Statistics & Risk Modeling 20(1-4)","DOI:10.1524/strm.2002.20.14.191"],"references":[]}
