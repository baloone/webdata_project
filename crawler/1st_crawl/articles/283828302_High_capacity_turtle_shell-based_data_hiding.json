{"id":"283828302_High_capacity_turtle_shell-based_data_hiding","abstract":"Data hiding is a technique for sending secret information under the cover of the digital media. It is usually used to protect privacy and sensitive information when such information is transmitted via a public network. To date, high capacity remains one of the most important research aspects of data hiding. In this study, a new, turtle shell-based data hiding scheme is proposed to improve embedding capacity further while guaranteeing good image quality. In the proposed, turtle shell-based scheme, a reference matrix is composed and a location table is generated. Then, according to the reference matrix and the location table, each pixel pair is processed to conceal four secret bits. The experimental results indicated that the proposed scheme achieved higher embedding capacity and lower distortion of images than some existing schemes.","authors":["Ching-Chun Chang","Son Thai Nguyen","Yanjun Liu"],"meta":["October 2015Image Processing, IET 10(2)","DOI:10.1049/iet-ipr.2014.1015"],"references":["275431742_Data_hiding_method_in_binary_images_based_on_block_masking_for_key_authentication","220512549_Improved_modification_direction_methods","3417888_Efficient_Steganographic_Embedding_by_Exploiting_Modification_Direction","3343443_LSB_matching_revisited","326998029_A_Steganographic_Scheme_by_Fully_Exploiting_Modification_Directions","304262699_Adaptive_Lossless_Data_Hiding_Scheme_for_SMVQ-Compressed_Images_using_SOC_Coding","271920221_Multi-layer_assignment_steganography_using_graph-theoretic_approach","267761128_Reversible_data_embedding_for_indices_based_on_histogram_analysis","264826732_A_data_hiding_scheme_using_pixel_value_differencing_and_improving_exploiting_modification_directions","260665287_An_Inpainting-Assisted_Reversible_Steganographic_Scheme_Using_a_Histogram_Shifting_Mechanism","260014974_A_PVD-based_Data_Hiding_Method_with_Histogram_Preserving_Using_Pixel_Pair_Matching","256992023_High_capacity_reversible_data_hiding_scheme_based_upon_discrete_cosine_transformation","251638990_Robust_and_secured_image-adaptive_data_hiding","224237649_A_Novel_Data_Embedding_Method_Using_Adaptive_Pixel_Pair_Matching","222536927_Vulnerability_of_pixel_value_differncing_steganography_to_histogram_analysis_and_modification_for_enhanced_security","220722308_F5-A_Steganographic_Algorithm","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220375670_A_data_hiding_scheme_using_the_varieties_of_pixel-value_differencing_in_multimedia_images","3197044_The_Data_Encryption_Standard_in_Perspective","3160736_A_secure_data_hiding_scheme_for_binary_images"]}
