{"id":"321139497_A_Topic-Level_Comparison_of_the_ACMIEEE_CS_Curriculum_Volumes","abstract":"Curricula are not static, especially in Computer Science. Curricula specifications are updated and it is not always clear what the exact updates are nor the impact these updated may have on a curriculum which has been developed to comply with the specification. In this paper, the results of a comparison on the knowledge unit and topic-level between the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum volumes of 2001, 2008 and 2013 is presented.","authors":["Linda Marshall"],"meta":["November 2017Communications in Computer and Information Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69670-6_22","Conference: Annual Conference of the Southern African Computer Lecturers' Association","Project: Computer Science Teaching and Learning"],"references":["316858624_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","258991781_A_Comparison_of_the_Core_Aspects_of_the_ACMIEEE_Computer_Science_Curriculum_2013_Strawman_Report_with_the_Specified_Core_of_CC2001_and_CS2008_Review","254007367_Computer_science_curriculum_2013_Reviewing_the_strawman_report_from_the_ACMIEEE-CS_task_force","220803589_Deriving_a_digraph_isomorphism_for_digraph_compliance_measurement","220425426_A_tour_through_the_Visualization_zoo","220420265_Computing_Curricula_1991","220310165_A_Tour_through_the_Visualization_Zoo"]}
