{"id":"346007143_Characterising_Computational_Thinking_in_Mathematics_Education_A_literature-informed_Delphi_study","abstract":"Recently, computational thinking has attracted much research attention, especially within primary and secondary education settings. However, incorporating computational thinking (CT) in mathematics or other disciplines is not a straightforward process and introduces many challenges concerning the way disciplines are organised and taught in school. The aim of this paper is to identify what characterises CT in mathematics education and which CT aspects can be addressed within mathematics education. First, we present a systematic literature review that identifies characteristics of computational thinking that have been explored in mathematics education research. Second, we present the results of a Delphi study conducted to capture the collective opinion of 25 experts in both the fields of mathematics education and computer science regarding the opportunities for addressing computational thinking in mathematics education. The results of the Delphi study, which corroborate the findings of the literature review, highlight three important aspects of computational thinking to be addressed in mathematics education: problem-solving, cognitive processes, and transposition.","authors":["Maria Kallia","Sylvia Patricia van Borkulo","Paul Drijvers","Erik Barendsen"],"meta":["November 2020Research in Mathematics Education","DOI:10.1080/14794802.2020.1852104","Projects: Research of mathematics educationComputational thinking in Mathematics education"],"references":["334280681_Unplugged_Approaches_to_Computational_Thinking_a_Historical_Perspective","328739531_Programming_Approaches_to_Computational_Thinking_Integrating_Turtle_Geometry_Dynamic_Manipulation_and_3D_Space","327939401_Computational_thinking_as_an_emergent_learning_trajectory_of_mathematics","327712680_Coding_Robots_as_a_Source_of_Instantiations_for_Arithmetic","326894640_Mathematics_Learning_through_Computational_Thinking_Activities_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","344839559_Classroom_Games_and_Activities_that_Motivate_Exploration_of_Foundational_Understandings_of_Mathematics_Concepts_while_Inadvertently_Scaffolding_Computational_Thinking_and_Engineered_Design","344534113_Planting_the_Seeds_of_Computational_Thinking_An_Introduction_to_Programming_Suitable_for_Inclusion_in_STEM_Curricula","343757273_Affective_Issues_in_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_Some_Theoretical_Considerations","328325177_Experiences_in_Learning_Problem-Solving_through_Computational_Thinking","326704954_Teaching_future_teachers_to_code_-_Programming_and_computational_thinking_for_teacher_students"]}
