{"id":"323277973_Survey_paper_on_crime_prediction_using_ensemble_approach","abstract":"Crime is a foremost problem where the top priority has been concerned by individual, the community and government. This paper investigates a number of data mining algorithms and ensemble learning which are applied on crime data mining. This survey paper describes a summary of the methods and techniques which are implemented in crime data analysis and prediction. Crime forecasting is a way of trying to mining out and decreasing the upcoming crimes by forecasting the future crime that will occur. Crime prediction practices historical data and after examining data, predict the upcoming crime with respect to location, time, day, season and year. In present crime cases rapidly increases so it is an inspiring task to foresee upcoming crimes closely with better accuracy. Data mining methods are too important to resolving crime problem with investigating hidden crime patterns.so the objective of this study could be analyzing and discussing various methods which are applied on crime prediction and analysis. This paper delivers reasonable investigation of Data mining Techniques and ensemble classification techniques for discovery and prediction of upcoming crime.","authors":["Ayishu Almaw","Kalyani Kadam"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 118(8):133-138","Project: machine learning and data mining"],"references":[]}
