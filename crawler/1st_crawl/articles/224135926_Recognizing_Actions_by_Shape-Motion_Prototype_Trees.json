{"id":"224135926_Recognizing_Actions_by_Shape-Motion_Prototype_Trees","abstract":"A prototype-based approach is introduced for action recognition. The approach represents an action as a sequence of prototypes for efficient and flexible action matching in long video sequences. During training, first, an action prototype tree is learned in a joint shape and motion space via hierarchical k-means clustering; then a lookup table of prototype-to-prototype distances is generated. During testing, based on a joint likelihood model of the actor location and action prototype, the actor is tracked while a frame-to-prototype correspondence is established by maximizing the joint likelihood, which is efficiently performed by searching the learned prototype tree; then actions are recognized using dynamic prototype sequence matching. Distance matrices used for sequence matching are rapidly obtained by look-up table indexing, which is an order of magnitude faster than brute-force computation of frame-to-frame distances. Our approach enables robust action matching in very challenging situations (such as moving cameras, dynamic backgrounds) and allows automatic alignment of action sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves recognition rates of 91.07% on a large gesture dataset (with dynamic backgrounds), 100% on the Weizmann action dataset and 95.77% on the KTH action dataset.","authors":["Zhe Lin","Zhuolin Jiang","Larry S.
