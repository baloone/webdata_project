{"id":"340530701_Applications_of_Network_Science_to_Education_Research_Quantifying_Knowledge_and_the_Development_of_Expertise_through_Network_Analysis","abstract":"A fundamental goal of education is to inspire and instill deep, meaningful, and long-lasting conceptual change within the knowledge landscapes of students. This commentary posits that the tools of network science could be useful in helping educators achieve this goal in two ways. First, methods from cognitive psychology and network science could be helpful in quantifying and analyzing the structure of studentsâ€™ knowledge of a given discipline as a knowledge network of interconnected concepts. Second, network science methods could be relevant for investigating the developmental trajectories of knowledge structures by quantifying structural change in knowledge networks, and potentially inform instructional design in order to optimize the acquisition of meaningful knowledge as the student progresses from being a novice to an expert in the subject. This commentary provides a brief introduction to common network science measures and suggests how they might be relevant for shedding light on the cognitive processes that underlie learning and retrieval, and discusses ways in which generative network growth models could inform pedagogical strategies to enable meaningful long-term conceptual change and knowledge development among students.","authors":["Cynthia Siew"],"meta":["April 2020Education Sciences 10(4):101","DOI:10.3390/educsci10040101"],"references":["338777092_Feature_distinctiveness_effects_in_language_acquisition_and_lexical_processing_Insights_from_megastudies","338015597_Quantifying_the_interplay_of_semantics_and_phonology_during_failures_of_word_retrieval_by_people_with_aphasia_using_a_multiplex_lexical_network","337569044_Contributions_of_Modern_Network_Science_to_the_Cognitive_Sciences_Revisiting_research_spirals_of_representation_and_process","336949792_Network_Growth_Modeling_to_Capture_Individual_Lexical_Learning","336628992_Forma_mentis_networks_quantify_crucial_differences_in_STEM_perception_between_students_and_experts","333838374_Cognitive_Network_Science_A_Review_of_Research_on_Cognition_through_the_Lens_of_Network_Representations_Processes_and_Dynamics","332823564_Analyzing_Knowledge_Retrieval_Impairments_Associated_with_Alzheimer's_Disease_Using_Network_Analyses","337741405_The_multiplex_structure_of_the_mental_lexicon_influences_picture_naming_in_people_with_aphasia","332811132_English_semantic_feature_production_norms_An_extended_database_of_4436_concepts","332366725_Modeling_early_lexico-semantic_network_development_Perceptual_features_matter_most"]}
