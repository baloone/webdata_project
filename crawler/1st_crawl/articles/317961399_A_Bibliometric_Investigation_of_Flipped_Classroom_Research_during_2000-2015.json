{"id":"317961399_A_Bibliometric_Investigation_of_Flipped_Classroom_Research_during_2000-2015","abstract":"The paper analyzed the global growth and development of flipped classroom research productivity in terms of publication output as reflected in SCI/SSCI for the period 2000-2015. Publication types and languages, characteristics of articles outputs, countries, subject categories and journals, and the frequency of keywords were analyzed using bibliometric methods. There are 149 articles in 78 journals listed in 41 SCI/SSCI subject categories. A sharp growth trend of publication output was observed during 2011-2015. USA played a predominant role in flipped classroom research. Education educational research, chemistry and medical were the top 3 categories and “active learning” and “blended learning” recent major topics of flipped classroom research during the past 16 years. The results could help researchers understand the characteristics of research output and search hot spots of flipped education field.","authors":["Lie Yang","Tiantian Sun","Yanli Liu"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 12(06):178","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v12i06.7095"],"references":["306045365_Use_of_the_flipped_classroom_instructional_model_in_higher_education_instructors'_perspectives","284879823_The_flipped_classroom_in_an_undergraduate_nutritional_science_course_A_pilot_study","277973506_Example_of_a_micro-adaptive_instruction_methodology_for_the_improvement_of_flipped-classrooms_and_adaptive-learning_based_on_advanced_blended-learning_tools","288701411_Teaching_in_flipped_classrooms_Exploring_pre-service_teachers'_concerns","287974407_The_evidence_for_'flipping_out'_A_systematic_review_of_the_flipped_classroom_in_nursing_education","284240795_Effectiveness_of_the_Surgery_Core_Clerkship_Flipped_Classroom_a_prospective_cohort_trial","282634840_ConfChem_Conference_on_Flipped_Classroom_Student_Engagement_with_Flipped_Chemistry_Lectures","282634832_ConfChem_Conference_on_Flipped_Classroom_Using_a_Blog_To_Flip_a_Classroom","282556499_Introduction_to_the_Spring_2014_ConfChem_on_the_Flipped_Classroom","282547905_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_a_Flipped_Format_General_Chemistry_Course"]}
