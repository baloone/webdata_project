{"id":"247007729_On_heights_of_p-ADIC_dynamical_systems","abstract":"When we consider the properties of the iterates of a noninvertible endomorphism of a formal group, all the roots of iterates of the endomorphism are simple and the full commuting family contains both invertible and nonin- vertible series. Experimental evidence seems to suggest that for an invertible series to commute with a noninvertible series with only simple roots of iterates, two such commuting power series must be endomorphisms of a single formal group. Lubin proposed four conjectures to support this conjecture. In this paper, we provide answers to these four conjectures.","authors":["HUA-CHIEH LI"],"meta":["January 2002Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 130(2)","DOI:10.2307/2699632"],"references":["266940939_Sue_les_groupes_de_Galois_attaches_aux_groupes_p-divisibles","266237904_-adic_Power_Series_which_Commute_under_Composition","246216198_Formal_Complex_Multiplication_in_Local_Fields","243002949_Automorphisms_and_extensions_of_kt","238289651_p-adic_Periodic_Points_and_Sen's_Theorem","33712356_On_Automorphisms_of_Local_Fields"]}
