{"id":"3697332_Towards_standard_for_experiments_in_program_comprehension","abstract":"Program comprehension can make a unique contribution to the field\nof software engineering because it is feasible to validate its claims\nwith inexpensive experiments. To fully realize this unique position,\nprogram comprehension researchers need to develop standards that will\nguide them in designing experiments and allow them to judge the strength\nof an experiment in supporting a claim. To begin the discussion leading\nto such standards, we propose that program comprehension experiments\nalways measure and interpret the following dependent variables:\naccuracy, accurate response time, and inaccurate response time","authors":["Vaclav Rajlich","George S.
