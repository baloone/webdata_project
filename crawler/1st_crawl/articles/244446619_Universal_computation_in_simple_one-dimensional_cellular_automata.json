{"id":"244446619_Universal_computation_in_simple_one-dimensional_cellular_automata","abstract":"The existence of computation-universal one-dimensional cellular automata with seven states per cell for a transition function depending on the cell itself and its nearest neighbors (r=1), and four states per cell for r=2 (when next-nearest neighbors also are included), is shown. It is also demonstrated that a Turing machine with m tape symbols and n internal states can be simulated by a cellular automaton of range r=1 with m+n+2 states per cell.","authors":["Kristian Lindgren","M.
