{"id":"289671441_A_Review_of_Graphical_Authentication_Utilising_a_Keypad_Input_Method","abstract":"The traditional password has long been the most widely used authentication mechanism in spite of its well-known flaws. In order to address these flaws, researchers have utilised images or drawings as a potential alternative. In this paper, we consider the attributes of several graphic-based techniques. As a result, the study suggests a new data-entry classification within the field of graphical authentication. Several related graphical password schemes that share the characteristic of keypad typing entry are reviewed here. In addition, various illustrative summaries are provided in accordance with the related category, which also shows the fundamental design aspects associated with each category. This work aims to benefit researchers in the field of authentication security with an interest in alternative authentication methods.","authors":["Hussain Alsaiari","Maria Papadaki","Paul S Haskell-Dowland","Steven Furnell"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1142/9781783269150_0031","Conference: Proceedings of the Eighth Saudi Students Conference in the UK"],"references":["268303410_A_Well_Known_Tool_Based_Graphical_Authentication_Technique","267944971_Passblot_A_Highly_Scalable_Graphical_One_Time_Password_System","266583345_Issues_Threats_and_Future_Trend_for_GSP","237048875_Security_in_Graphical_Authentication","232550420_Perception_and_memory_for_pictures_Single-trial_learning_of_2500_visual_stimuli","228610610_Inkblot_authentication","224142306_Against_spyware_using_CAPTCHA_in_graphical_password_scheme","221474693_Order_and_entropy_in_picture_passwords","221436810_Evaluating_the_usability_and_security_of_a_graphical_one-time_PIN_system","221296340_Towards_Identifying_Usability_and_Security_Features_of_Graphical_Password_in_Knowledge_Based_Authentication_Technique","221199752_A_Shoulder-Surfing_Resistant_Graphical_Password_Scheme_-_WIW","221199623_A_Graphical_Password_Scheme_Strongly_Resistant_to_Spyware","221166484_A_comparison_of_perceived_and_real_shoulder-surfing_risks_between_alphanumeric_and_graphical_passwords","221046286_Graphical_Passwords_A_Survey","2904347_Securing_Passwords_Against_Dictionary_Attacks","2520390_Dos_and_Don'ts_of_Client_Authentication_on_the_Web","284493164_A_new_graphical_password_scheme_against_spyware_by_using_CAPTCHA","279413200_Extended_OTP_Mechanism_Based_on_Graphical_Password_Method","267987405_GrIDsure_Effects_of_background_images_on_pattern_choice_usability_and_memorability_ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","262410767_Two-factor_authentication_system_based_on_extended_OTP_mechanism","250702077_Replacing_passwords_In_search_of_the_secret_remedy","240189657_Two_factor_authentication_that_doesn't_use_chips","234775191_Security_Engineering_A_Guide_to_Building_Dependable_Distributed_Systems","226588154_Passblot_A_Usable_Way_of_Authentication_Scheme_to_Generate_One_Time_Passwords","223526631_PassPoints_Design_and_longitudinal_evaluation_of_a_graphical_password_system","223403852_Feasibility_study_of_tactile-based_authentication","222678254_Is_a_picture_really_worth_a_thousand_words_Exploring_the_feasibility_of_graphical_authentication_systems","222075853_Authenticating_ourselves_Will_we_ever_escape_the_password","220694393_Information_Security_Principles_and_Practice","220496772_The_Future_of_Authentication","220152378_Security_analysis_of_a_password-based_authentication_protocol_proposed_to_IEEE_1363","220066828_Token-based_graphical_password_authentication","2961852_Password-Based_Authentication_Preventing_Dictionary_Attacks","2243582_D_ej_a_Vu_A_User_Study_Using_Images_for_Authentication"]}
