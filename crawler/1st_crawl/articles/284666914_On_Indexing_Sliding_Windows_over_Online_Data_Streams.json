{"id":"284666914_On_Indexing_Sliding_Windows_over_Online_Data_Streams","abstract":"We consider indexing sliding windows in main memory over on-line data streams. Our proposed data structures and query semantics are based on a division of the sliding window into sub-windows. By classifying windowed operators according to their method of execution, we motivate the need for two types of windowed indices: those which provide a list of attribute values and their counts for answering set-valued queries, and those which provide direct access to tuples for answering attribute-valued queries. We propose and evaluate indices for both of these cases and show that our techniques are more efficient than executing windowed queries without an index.","authors":["Lukasz Golab","Shaveen Garg","M.
