{"id":"331912424_A_Pseudo-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information_and_Few_Random_Positions","abstract":"We consider two-person zero-sum stochastic mean payoff games with perfect information, or BWR-games, given by a digraph G=(V,E), with local rewards r:E→Z, and three types of positions: black V B , white V W , and random V R forming a partition of V. It is a long-standing open question whether a polynomial time algorithm for BWR-games exists, or not, even when |V R |=0. In fact, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for BWR-games would already imply their polynomial solvability. In this paper, ¹ we show that BWR-games with a constant number of random positions can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time. More precisely, in any BWR-game with |V R |=O(1), a saddle point in uniformly optimal pure stationary strategies can be found in time polynomial in |V W |+|V B |, the maximum absolute local reward, and the common denominator of the transition probabilities.","authors":["Endre Boros","Khaled Elbassioni","Vladimir Alexander Gurvich","Kazuhisa Makino"],"meta":["March 2019Information and Computation 267(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2019.03.005"],"references":["309388530_A_Convex_Programming-based_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information","281058761_A_Potential_Reduction_Algorithm_for_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games","273704304_An_Improved_Pseudo-Polynomial_Upper_Bound_for_the_Value_Problem_and_Optimal_Strategy_Synthesis_in_Mean_Payoff_Games","262284883_A_Pseudo-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information_and_Few_Random_Positions","226034010_Algorithms_for_stochastic_games_-_A_survey","222079059_Cyclic_games_and_an_algorithm_to_find_minimax_cycle_means_in_directed_graphs","220897618_Stochastic_Mean_Payoff_Games_Smoothed_Analysis_and_Approximation_Schemes","220780052_A_Deterministic_Subexponential_Algorithm_for_Solving_Parity_Games","220779601_Quantitative_Stochastic_Parity_Games","220589096_Cyclical_games_with_prohibitions","29616281_Simple_Stochastic_Games_with_Few_Random_Vertices_Are_Easy_to_Solve","316518696_On_algorithms_for_simple_stochastic_games","313559347_Stochastic_Games_with_Zero_Stop_Probabilities","301817872_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Energy_Games_with_Special_Weight_Structures","286292797_A_Potential_Reduction_Algorithm_for_Ergodic_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Limiting_Average_Payoff_Stochastic_Games","268841511_Criterion_and_test_for_ergodicity_of_cyclic_game_forms","265996860_Mean_Cost_Cyclical_Games","257800571_On_Canonical_Forms_for_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Mean_Payoff_Games","257012038_On_discounted_approximations_of_undiscounted_stochastic_games_and_Markov_decision_processes_with_limited_randomness","243007987_Extensions_of_two_person_zero_sum_games1","238878217_Stochastic_Games_with_Perfect_Information_and_Time_Average_Payoff","226645887_Positional_strategies_for_mean_payoff_games","225148370_A_Pumping_Algorithm_for_Ergodic_Stochastic_Mean_Payoff_Games_with_Perfect_Information","225113454_The_Complexity_of_Solving_Stochastic_Games_on_Graphs","223216792_Cyclic_games_and_linear_programming","222820032_Reduction_of_stochastic_parity_to_stochastic_mean-payoff_games","222785304_The_complexity_of_mean_payoff_games_on_graphs","222693362_Combinatorial_structure_and_randomized_subexponential_algorithms_for_infinite_games","222504823_Deciding_the_winner_in_parity_games_is_in_UP_co-UP","222444446_The_complexity_of_stochastic_games","221544015_New_Results_on_Simple_Stochastic_Games","220975230_A_Combinatorial_Strongly_Subexponential_Strategy_Improvement_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Games","51967144_Solving_Simple_Stochastic_Games_with_Few_Coin_Toss_Positions","30816007_Simple_Stochastic_Games_Parity_Games_Mean_Payoff_Games_and_Discounted_Payoff_Games_Are_All_LP-Type_Problems","2218244_Termination_Criteria_for_Solving_Concurrent_Safety_and_Reachability_Games"]}
