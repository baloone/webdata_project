{"id":"339907618_Intra-_and_interobserver_reproducibility_of_second_trimester_ultrasound_cervical_length_measurement_in_a_general_population","abstract":"Objectives: To evaluate the reproducibility of ultrasound cervical length (CL) measurement at the second trimester.\nMethods: A set of 565 cervical ultrasound images were collected at 19 + 0–24 + 6 weeks’ gestation. Two senior maternal–fetal specialists measured CL in each image on three occasions 2 weeks apart. In the interval between the first and following two measures, the clinicians reviewed 20 images together to agree on the criteria for measurement. Measurements were analyzed for intra- and inter-observer disagreement. The robustness of patient classification when CL measure was used with different cutoff thresholds was analyzed.\nResults: Average intra-observer deviation was 2.8 mm for clinician 1 and 3.7 mm for clinician 2. Inter-observer deviation among the two clinicians was 5.2 and 3.2 mm before and after reviewing measurement criteria together. When cutoffs were used to classify as “short” cervix, disagreement ranged from 22 to 70% depending on operator and threshold used.\nConclusion: Ultrasound CL measurements by experts showed moderate intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. The use of specific cutoffs to classify patients as high or low risk resulted in wide disagreements. The results stress the importance of training and quality assessments on considering universal screening application of CL measurement.","authors":["Núria Baños","Xavier P Burgos-Artizzu","Brenda Valenzuela","David Coronado-Gutiérrez"],"meta":["March 2020The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine: the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","DOI:10.1080/14767058.2020.1733516"],"references":["273153813_Transvaginal_sonographic_evaluation_of_cervical_length_in_the_second_trimester_of_asymptomatic_singleton_pregnancies_and_the_risk_of_preterm_delivery","315058415_Predictive_Accuracy_of_Serial_Transvaginal_Cervical_Lengths_and_Quantitative_Vaginal_Fetal_Fibronectin_Levels_for_Spontaneous_Preterm_Birth_Among_Nulliparous_Women","301758196_Society_for_Maternal-Fetal_Medicine_SMFM_Consult_40_The_role_of_routine_cervical_length_screening_in_selected_high-_and_low-_risk_women_for_preterm_birth_prevention","299571433_A_Guideline_of_Selecting_and_Reporting_Intraclass_Correlation_Coefficients_for_Reliability_Research","280695453_The_capacity_of_mid-pregnancy_cervical_length_to_predict_preterm_birth_in_low-risk_women_A_national_cohort_study","271590253_How_to_measure_cervical_length","265212700_Is_Universal_Cervical_Length_Screening_Indicated_in_Women_with_Prior_Term_Birth","257300411_Short_Ultrasonographic_Cervical_Length_in_Women_With_Low-Risk_Obstetric_History","227984971_Practice_guidelines_for_performance_of_the_routine_mid-trimester_fetal_ultrasound_scan","51181960_Intraobserver_and_Interobserver_Reliability_of_Transvaginal_Cervical_Length_Measurements_and_Quantitative_Ultrasound_Tissue_Characterization_of_the_Cervix_in_the_Second_and_Third_Trimester_of_Pregnanc","24193046_Reference_range_for_cervical_length_throughout_pregnancy_Non-parametric_LMS-based_model_applied_to_a_large_sample","14052400_Measurement_of_the_pregnant_cervix_by_transvaginal_sonography_An_interobserver_study_and_new_standards_to_improve_the_interobserver_variability","13466566_Cervical_length_at_23_weeks_of_gestation_Prediction_of_spontaneous_preterm_delivery","13466565_Cervical_length_at_23_weeks_of_gestation_Relation_to_demographic_characteristics_and_previous_obstetric_history","11160416_Intra-_and_interobserver_reproducibility_of_ultrasound_measurements_of_cervical_length_and_width_in_the_second_and_third_trimesters_of_pregnancy"]}
