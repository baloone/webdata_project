{"id":"257768138_An_application_of_matrix_multiplication","abstract":"We are well aware of the ever increasing importance of graphical and matrix representations in applications to several day-to-day real life problems. The interconnectedness of the notion of graph, matrix, probability, limits, and system of equations are visible and approachable in the use of Markov Chains. We discuss here an interesting activity that involves the above concepts in the problem of weather pattern analysis.","authors":["Venkataraman Yegnanarayanan"],"meta":["April 2013Resonance 18(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12045-013-0052-0"],"references":["344482593_Graphs_and_Applications","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","200621937_Introductory_Graph_Theory"]}
