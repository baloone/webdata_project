{"id":"344706864_A_Substructural_Epistemic_Resource_Logic_Theory_and_Modelling_Applications","abstract":"We present a substructural epistemic logic, based on Boolean BI, in which the epistemic modalities are parametrized on agents’ local resources. The new modalities can be seen as generalizations of the usual epistemic modalities. The logic combines Boolean BI’s resource semantics—we introduce BI and its resource semantics at some length—with epistemic agency. We illustrate the use of the logic in systems modelling by discussing some examples about access control, including semaphores, using resource tokens. We also give a labelled tableaux calculus and establish soundness and completeness with respect to the resource semantics.","authors":["Didier Galmiche","Pierre Kimmel","David Pym"],"meta":["December 2019Journal of Logic and Computation 29(8):1251-1287","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exz024"],"references":["324575475_A_Stone-type_Duality_Theorem_for_Separation_Logic_Via_its_Underlying_Bunched_Logics","302059548_A_Logic_of_Separating_Modalities","333338631_Resource_semantics_logic_as_a_modelling_technology","318830100_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic","313857563_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory","311365227_A_Substructural_Epistemic_Resource_Logic","307720029_An_Epistemic_Separation_Logic","298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","281390706_A_Modal_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Dynamics","271530365_Budget-Constrained_Knowledge_in_Multiagent_Systems","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","262334430_Parametric_Completeness_for_Separation_Theories"]}
