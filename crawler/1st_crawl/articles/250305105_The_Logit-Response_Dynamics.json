{"id":"250305105_The_Logit-Response_Dynamics","abstract":"We develop a characterization of stochastically stable states for the logit-response learning dynamics in games, with arbitrary specifcation of revision opportunities. The result allows us to show convergence to the set of Nash equilibria in the class of best-response potential games and the failure of the dynamics to select potential maximizers beyond the class of exact potential games. We also study to which extent equilibrium selection is robust to the specifcation of revision opportunities. Our techniques can be extended and applied to a wide class of learning dynamics in games.","authors":["Carlos Al√≥s-Ferrer","Nick Netzer"],"meta":["March 2010Games and Economic Behavior 68(2):413-427","DOI:10.1016/j.geb.2009.08.004","SourceRePEc"],"references":["250243258_The_Evolutionary_Stability_of_Perfectly_Competitive_Behavior","230663805_Potential_Games","284037306_On_small_random_perturbations_of_dynamical_systems","268650056_A_general_theory_of_equilibrium_selection_in_games_With_a_foreword_by_Robert_Aumann","266720514_Revisiting_log-linear_learning_Asynchrony_completeness_and_payoff-based_implementation","261872528_Random_Perturbations_of_Dynamical_Systems","260422757_A_Law_of_Comparative_Judgment","243777612_Individual_Strategy_and_Social_Structure","233821419_The_Theory_of_Evolution_and_Dynamical_Systems","232421807_The_Evolution_of_Conventions","229005584_Stochastic_Evolution_with_Perturbed_Payo_s_and_Rapid_Play","226103517_Control_costs_and_potential_functions_for_spatial_games","222835492_A_multinomial_probit_model_of_stochastic_evolution","222834626_Evolution_in_Games_with_Endogenous_Mistake_Probabilities","222672470_Generalized_potentials_and_robust_sets_of_equilibria","222500618_Evolution_of_Equilibria_in_the_Long_Run_A_General_Theory_and_Applications","222498764_Simple_and_clever_decision_rules_for_a_model_of_evolution","222445573_Quantal_Response_Equilibria_in_Normal_Form_Games","222435335_Evolution_in_games_with_randomly_disturbed_payoffs","222032863_Binary_Games_with_State_Dependent_Stochastic_Choice","46466535_Evolution_with_State-Dependent_Mutations","46432009_Waiting_Times_and_Equilibrium_Selection","24057955_A_note_on_control_costs_and_logit_rules_for_strategic_games","23740336_Population_Games","23647522_Log-linear_Dynamics_and_Local_Potential","4977515_Perfect_Foresight_and_Equilibrium_Selection_in_Symmetric_Potential_Games","4975486_Pigouvian_pricing_and_stochastic_evolutionary_implementation","4898442_Learning_Mutation_And_Long_Run_Equilibria_In_Games","4896390_A_Simple_Adaptive_Procedure_Leading_to_Correlated_Equilibrium","4896223_The_Evolution_of_Walrasian_Behavior","4896180_Evolution_with_State-Dependent_Mutations","4849618_Best-response_potential_games","4815834_On_the_Global_Convergence_of_Stochastic_Fictitious_Play","4783361_Basins_of_Attraction_Long-Run_Stochastic_Stability_and_the_Speed_of_Step-by-Step_Evolution","4767703_The_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Strategic_Interaction","4765533_Probabilistic_choice_and_procedurally_bounded_rationality","4733085_Pigouvian_pricing_and_stochastic_evolutionary_implementation","2332100_How_Noise_Matters"]}
