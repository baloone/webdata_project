{"id":"259578232_Modeling_and_Predicting_Popularity_Dynamics_via_Reinforced_Poisson_Processes","abstract":"An ability to predict the popularity dynamics of individual items within a\ncomplex evolving system has important implications in an array of areas. Here\nwe propose a generative probabilistic framework using a reinforced Poisson\nprocess to model explicitly the process through which individual items gain\ntheir popularity. This model distinguishes itself from existing models via its\ncapability of modeling the arrival process of popularity and its remarkable\npower at predicting the popularity of individual items. It possesses the\nflexibility of applying Bayesian treatment to further improve the predictive\npower using a conjugate prior. Extensive experiments on a longitudinal citation\ndataset demonstrate that this model consistently outperforms existing\npopularity prediction methods.","authors":["Hua-Wei Shen","Dashun Wang","Chaoming Song","Albert-Laszlo Barabasi"],"meta":["January 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257464845_Cumulative_Effect_in_Information_Diffusion_Empirical_Study_on_a_Microblogging_Network","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","236203405_Popularity_Prediction_in_Microblogging_Network_A_Case_Study_on_Sina_Weibo","329255416_New_Product_Diffusion_Models_in_Marketing_A_Review_and_Directions_for_Research","286508344_Citation_Prediction_in_Heterogeneous_Bibliographic_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","254464234_Rise_and_fall_patterns_of_information_diffusion_Model_and_implications","242351689_New_Product_Diffusion_Models_in_Marketing_A_Review_and_Directions_for_Research","236843997_Modeling_Information_Propagation_with_Survival_Theory","232913299_Publishing_Handful_of_papers_dominates_citation"]}
