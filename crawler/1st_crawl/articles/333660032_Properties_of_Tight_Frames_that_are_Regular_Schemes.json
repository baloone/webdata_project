{"id":"333660032_Properties_of_Tight_Frames_that_are_Regular_Schemes","abstract":"Finite frames are sequences of vectors in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces that play a key role in signal processing and coding theory. In this paper, we study the class of tight unit-norm frames for ℂd that also form regular schemes, which we call tight regular schemes (TRS). Many common frames that arise in applications such as equiangular tight frames and mutually unbiased bases fall in this class. We investigate characteristic properties of TRSs and prove that for many constructions, they are intimately connected to weighted 1-designs—arising from cubature rules for integrals over spheres in ℂd—with weights dependent on the Voronoi regions of each frame element. Aided by additional numerical evidence, we conjecture that all TRSs in fact satisfy this property.","authors":["Malcolm Egan"],"meta":["May 2020Cryptography and Communications 12(3)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-019-00378-2"],"references":["281488227_Group_Frames_With_Few_Distinct_Inner_Products_and_Low_Coherence","325478406_An_introduction_to_finite_tight_frames","319284711_The_Levenstein_bound_for_packings_in_projective_spaces","303914714_Optimal_codebooks_achieving_the_Levenshtein_bound_from_generalized_bent_functions_over_Z_4_mathbb_Z_4","303400173_Construction_of_k-Angle_Tight_Frames","282900218_Optimal_Codebooks_From_Binary_Codes_Meeting_the_Levenshtein_Bound","273394714_New_Families_of_Codebooks_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","266249673_Complete_Diagonals_of_Latin_Squares","265547516_Parameters_of_t-Designs_in","260657182_Structured_and_Sparse_Limited_Feedback_Codebooks_for_Multiuser_MIMO","239062924_Z4-Kerdock_Codes_Orthogonal_Spreads_and_Extremal_Euclidean_Line-Sets","257765646_Bounds_for_packings_of_metric_spaces_and_some_of_their_applications","244504980_t-Designs_in_Projective_Spaces","234022310_Finite_Frames_Theory_and_Applications","225490679_Tight_Frames_and_Their_Symmetries"]}
