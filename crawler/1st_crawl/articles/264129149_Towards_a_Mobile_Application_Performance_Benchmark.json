{"id":"264129149_Towards_a_Mobile_Application_Performance_Benchmark","abstract":"In this work-in-progress paper, we present our current findings concerning performance efficiency in cross-platform mobile applications (apps) and how they can contribute to a general benchmarking approach. At first, several test cases for evaluating performance of mobile applications are described. Then, the performance efficiency of native and hybrid apps is compared on a mobile device using IBM Worklight. The results show that hybrid applications still suffer performance issues in comparison to native apps. The performance deviations and reasons for them are discussed and evaluated. It is concluded that the performance of mobile applications is crucial to user experience and satisfaction. Software quality should thus not be sacrificed, despite the economic attractiveness of hybrid development approaches. The results provide a starting point for a general approach to benchmark mobile application performance, which is discussed in the end.","authors":["Florian Rösler","André Nitze","Andreas Schmietendorf"],"meta":["July 2014","Conference: The Ninth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and ServicesAt: Paris, France","Project: Constructive Quality Model for Mobile Application Development (CoQuaMApp)"],"references":["257719523_Mobile_Multiplatform_Development_An_Experiment_for_Performance_Analysis","220883687_Model-Driven_Development_of_Mobile_Applications","220832162_MobDSL_A_Domain_Specific_Language_for_multiple_mobile_platform_deployment","272947238_Mobile_Application_Development_Web_vs_Native","272020668_Evaluating_Cross-Platform_Development_Approaches_for_Mobile_Applications","260584184_Cross-Platform_Development_Tools_for_Smartphone_Applications","221281829_Model-Driven_Architecture_for_Mobile_Applications"]}
