{"id":"220017627_Student_Writing_in_Higher_Education_An_Academic_Literacies_Approach","abstract":"This article addresses the issue of student writing in higher education. It draws on the findings of an Economic and Social Research Council funded project which examined the contrasting expectations and interpretations of academic staff and students regarding undergraduate students\" written assignments. It is suggested that the implicit models that have generally been used to understand student writing do not adequately take account of the importance of issues of identity and the institutional relationships of power and authority that surround, and are embedded within, diverse student writing practices across the university. A contrasting and therefore complementary perspective is used to present debates about \"good\" and \"poor' student writing. The article outlines an 'academic literacies' framework which can take account of the conflicting and contested nature of writing practices, and may therefore be more valuable for understanding student writing in today's higher education than traditional models and approaches.","authors":["Mary R Lea","Brian Street"],"meta":["June 1998Studies in Higher Education 23:157-172","DOI:10.1080/03075079812331380364"],"references":["308052515_Ethnography_and_ethnographers_of_and_in_education_A_situated_perspective","290815375_Towards_an_Anatomy_of_Academic_Discourse_Meaning_and_Context_in_the_Undergraduate_Essay","344487020_Discourse_Strategies","270155577_Discourse_Strategies","248478240_Writing_and_Identity_The_Discoursal_Construction_of_Identity_in_Academic_Writing","247662998_Student_Writing_in_Higher_Education","246312539_Genre_Knowledge_in_Disciplinary_Communication","238397736_Guilty_in_Whose_Eyes_University_students'_perceptions_of_cheating_and_plagiarism_in_academic_work_and_assessment","49550820_Discourse_and_Language_Education"]}
