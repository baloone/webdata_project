{"id":"339699199_Event-Based_Control_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Twenty_Years_of_Research","abstract":"The potential benefits of networked control systems are tremendous, as they can be easily upgraded by just including new components (i.e., sensors, actuators, or controllers), avoiding any further modifications to their structure. A critical approach to unleash such potential benefits is event-based control, where the system output turns to be sampled on demand, instead of being sampled constantly at rigid periods of time. This paper analyzes from a bibliometric point of view the literature published for the last twenty years on event-based control, identifying the most relevant articles, authors, institutions, and journals. Moreover, the principal topics, motivations, and problems faced by the researchers are discussed, identifying distinct challenges and opportunities for future research.","authors":["Ernesto Aranda Escolástico","Maria Guinaldo","Ruben Heradio","J.
