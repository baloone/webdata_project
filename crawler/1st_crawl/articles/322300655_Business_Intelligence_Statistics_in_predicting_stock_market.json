{"id":"322300655_Business_Intelligence_Statistics_in_predicting_stock_market","abstract":"Predicting stock market price over time is an important issue that needs to be addressed. The closing price for the stocks is strongly correlated to many variables, so, in order to make the prediction more accurate one must try to detect the most important ones. The main objective of this research is to predict the on day closing price of ten companies enlisted in the Romanian Stock Market using different machine learning (ML) techniques, such as multiple linear regression (MR), and multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) setup for regression.","authors":["Smaranda Belciug","Adrian Victor Sandita"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":[]}
