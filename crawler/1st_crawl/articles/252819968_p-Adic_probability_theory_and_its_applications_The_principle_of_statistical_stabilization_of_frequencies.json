{"id":"252819968_p-Adic_probability_theory_and_its_applications_The_principle_of_statistical_stabilization_of_frequencies","abstract":"The development of p-adic quantum mechanics has made it necessary to construct a probability theory in which the probabilities of events are p-adic numbers. The foundations of this theory are developed here. The frequency definition of probability is used. A general principle of statistical stabilization of relative frequencies is formulated. By virtue of this principle, statistical stabilization of relative frequencies, which are, like all experimental data, rational numbers, can be considered not only in the real topology but also in p-adic topologies.","authors":["Andrei Khrennikov"],"meta":["December 1993Theoretical and Mathematical Physics 97(3):1340-1348","DOI:10.1007/BF01015763"],"references":["285328582_The_spectral_theory_in_the_p-adic_quantum_mechanics","256220740_Superanalysis","246272265_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Probability_Theory","241620982_P-adic_quantum_mechanics_with_p-adic_valued_functions","234178444_Adelic_string_amplitudes","232537272_Probability_statistics_and_truth","226279526_Fundamentalstze_der_Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung","225734810_Les_Probabilites_denombrables_et_leurs_Applications_arithmetiques","222449264_Open_and_closed_p-adic_strings_and_quadratic_extensions_of_number_fields","38330499_p-Adic_quantum_mechanics"]}
