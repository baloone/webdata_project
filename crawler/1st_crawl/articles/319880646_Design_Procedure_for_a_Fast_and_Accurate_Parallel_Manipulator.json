{"id":"319880646_Design_Procedure_for_a_Fast_and_Accurate_Parallel_Manipulator","abstract":"This paper presents a design procedure for a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) translational parallel manipulator, named IRSBot-2. This design procedure aims at determining the optimal design parameters of the IRSBot-2 such that the robot can reach a velocity equal to 6 m/s, an acceleration up to 20 G, and a multidirectional repeatability up to 20 lm throughout its operational workspace. Besides, contrary to its counterparts, the stiffness of the IRSBot-2 should be very high along the normal to the plane of motion of its moving platform. A semi-industrial prototype of the IRSBot-2 has been realized based on the obtained optimum design parameters. This prototype and its main components are described in the paper. Its accuracy, repeatability, elasto-static performance, dynamic performance, and elasto-dynamic performance have been measured and analyzed as well. It turns out that the IRSBot-2 has globally reached the prescribed specifications and is a good candidate to perform very fast and accurate pick-and-place operations.","authors":["Sébastien Briot","Stéphane Caro","Coralie Germain"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics 9(6)","DOI:10.1115/1.4038009"],"references":["281158104_An_Efficient_Method_for_the_Natural_Frequency_Computation_of_Parallel_Robots","274645821_Geometric_calibration_of_industrial_robots_using_enhanced_partial_pose_measurements_and_design_of_experiments","271728752_Natural_Frequency_Computation_of_Parallel_Robots","270774954_Investigation_on_the_Effort_Transmission_in_Planar_Parallel_Manipulators","267490915_Optimal_Design_of_the_IRSBot-2_Based_on_an_Optimized_Test_Trajectory","267489189_IRSBOT-2_A_novel_two-DOF_parallel_robot_for_high-speed_operations","302560124_A_fast_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","292703966_Two_novel_parallel_mechanisms_with_less_than_six_dofs_and_the_applications","291607074_Connecting_Assembly_Modes_for_Workspace_Enlargement","281420308_Two-Degree-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulator"]}
