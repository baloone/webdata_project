{"id":"320996725_A_review_on_parameterized_string_matching_algorithms","abstract":"Identification of candidate genes and nucleotides are basic uses of the Bioinformatics research. Biology that deals with molecule has functional as well as structural behavior imparting need of well-furnished techniques to distinguish the molecules. Parameterized matching is one of those techniques which deal in identifying molecules having different functional and structural behavior. The word “Parameterized” represent the characters or symbols in the form of parameters. It implies that the sequence of characters forming text and pattern are matched if and only if the bijective mapping is formed between them. Exponential increase in the size of data sets leads the requirement to solve this matching problem in sub-linear time. This paper displays the review of single pattern parameterized pattern matching algorithms using q-grams having linear time complexities. It also discusses about the best algorithm that has less number of false matches. The comparisons done are based on certain criteria's presenting pros and cons of the algorithms.","authors":["Rama Singh","Deepak Rai","Rajesh Prasad"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Information and Optimization Sciences 39(1):1-9","DOI:10.1080/02522667.2017.1374730"],"references":["286809810_Maintaining_software_through_bit-parallelism_and_hashing_the_parameterized_q-grams","261653167_Algorithm_for_selection_of_domestic_solid_waste_disposal_site_in_developing_countries","260945080_Computer_Researchers_Harnessing_DNA_For_Computing","221314061_Sublinear_Algorithms_for_Parameterized_Matching","220661309_On-Line_Approximate_String_Searching_Algorithms_Survey_and_Experimental_Results","220661295_A_New_String_Matching_Algorithm","278399218_Tuning_the_Boyer-Moore-Horspool_string_searching_algorithm","267464149_Improved_algorithms_for_the_calculation_of_Fibonacci_numbers","261654116_Parameterized_String_Matching_Algorithms_with_Application_to_Molecular_Biology","242395993_Exact_string_matching_algorithms","222684127_Fast_string_matching_algorithms","221591044_Theory_of_parameterized_pattern_matching_Algorithms_and_applications","220555470_Combinatorial_Algorithms_Generation_Enumeration_and_Search","27523583_Alphabet_Dependence_in_Parameterized_Matching","2287171_Parameterized_Pattern_Matching_by_Boyer-Moore-type_Algorithms","2281759_Parameterized_Pattern_Matching_Algorithms_and_Applications"]}
