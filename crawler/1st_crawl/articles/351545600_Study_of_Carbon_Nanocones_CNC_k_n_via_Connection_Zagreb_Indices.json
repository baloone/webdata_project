{"id":"351545600_Study_of_Carbon_Nanocones_CNC_k_n_via_Connection_Zagreb_Indices","abstract":"Topology of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and nanocones has considerable worth due to their effective applications in nanotechnology. These are emerging materials of practical application in gas storage devises, nanoelectronics devices, energy storage, biosensor, and chemical probes. The topological indices are graph invariant used to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the compounds such as boiling point, stability, and strain energy through associated chemical graph of the underlying compound. We computed recently modified Zagreb connection indices of nanocones CNC4n,CNC5n, and CNC6n and generalized our findings up to a large class of CNCkn. Topological characterization of nanocones via these indices is mathematically novel and assists to enable its emerging use in nanotechnology. For computation and verification of results, we use Mathematica software.","authors":["Muhammad Asif","Muhammad Hussain","Hamad Almohamedh","Khalid M Alhamed"],"meta":["May 2021Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2021(1â€“8)","DOI:10.1155/2021/5539904"],"references":["348245744_Comparative_Study_of_Valency-Based_Topological_Descriptor_for_Hexagon_Star_Network","347578689_Polynomials_of_Degree-Based_Indices_for_Swapped_Networks_Modeled_by_Optical_Transpose_Interconnection_System","343700168_Zagreb_Connection_Indices_of_Molecular_Graphs_Based_on_Operations","343563009_Computing_Analysis_of_Connection-Based_Indices_and_Coindices_for_Product_of_Molecular_Networks","341224317_Modified_Zagreb_connection_indices_of_the_T-sum_graphs","338222836_Zagreb_Connection_Indices_of_Subdivision_and_Semi-Total_Point_Operations_on_Graphs","337231023_Exact_Formula_and_Improved_Bounds_for_General_Sum-Connectivity_Index_of_Graph-Operations","335735160_Zagreb_Connection_Indices_of_Two_Dendrimer_Nanostars","332718312_Computing_first_leap_Zagreb_index_of_some_nano_structures","334168081_Extremal_Graphs_with_Respect_to_the_Modified_First_Zagreb_Connection_Index"]}
