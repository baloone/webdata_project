{"id":"307917278_Context-Free_Petri_Net_Controlled_Grammars_under_Parallel_Firing_Strategy","abstract":"Petri nets are becoming one of the most important mathematical tools in Computer Science. In this paper we propose a new firing strategy in Petri Nets called a parallel firing strategy and study some mathematical properties of concurrent grammars which are controlled by Petri nets under parallel firing strategies.We propose some modes on this strategy and a notion of concurrent context-free grammar which is a similar to the context-free Petri nets under parallel firing strategy, where parallel firing modes of context-free Petri nets were converted to rule applications in context-free grammars. Moreover, we investigate some their properties.","authors":["Gairatzhan Mavlankulov","Laula Zhumabayeva","Mohamed Othman","Tamara Zhukabayeva"],"meta":["September 2016Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences 10(5):1757-1762","DOI:10.18576/amis/100515","Project: Grammars Controlled by Petri Nets Under Parallel Firing Strategies"],"references":["300723078_Some_Properties_of_the_Concurrent_Grammars","292150696_Parallel_firing_strategy_on_Petri_nets_A_review","289798754_Concurrent_Context-Free_Grammars","237124594_A_Petri_net_and_logic_approach_to_the_specification_and_verification_of_real-time_systems","233531732_Grammars_Controlled_by_Petri_Nets","228832375_Petri_Net_Controlled_Grammars_the_Power_of_Labeling_and_Final_Markings","291297849_Performance_equivalent_analysis_of_workflow_systems","262366841_Concurrent_Turing_Machines","255671959_Ordered_Firing_in_Petri_Nets","245450918_Applications_of_Petri_Nets_in_Manufacturing_Systems_Modeling_Control_and_Performance_Analysis","220836183_k-Petri_Net_Controlled_Grammars","220783910_Labeled_Step_Sequences_in_Petri_Nets","220690400_Performance_Models_of_Multiprocessor_Systems","220444804_Petri_Net_Controlled_Finite_Automata","215439783_Petri_Net_Theory_und_the_Modeling_of_a_System"]}
