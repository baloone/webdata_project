{"id":"342017773_Individual_differences_in_the_Muller-Lyer_and_Ponzo_illusions_are_stable_across_different_contexts","abstract":"Vision scientists have attempted to classify visual illusions according to certain aspects, such as brightness or spatial features. For example, Piaget proposed that visual illusion magnitudes either decrease or increase with age. Subsequently, it was suggested that illusions are segregated according to their context: real-world contexts enhance and abstract contexts inhibit illusion magnitudes with age. We tested the effects of context on the MÃ¼ller-Lyer and Ponzo illusions with a standard condition (no additional context), a line-drawing perspective condition, and a real-world perspective condition. A mixed-effects model analysis, based on data from 76 observers with ages ranging from 6 to 66 years, did not reveal any significant interaction between context and age. Although we found strong intra-illusion correlations for both illusions, we found only weak inter-illusion correlations, suggesting that the structure underlying these two spatial illusions includes several specific factors.","authors":["Aline F.
