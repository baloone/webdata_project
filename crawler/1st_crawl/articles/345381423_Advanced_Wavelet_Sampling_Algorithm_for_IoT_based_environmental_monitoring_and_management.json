{"id":"345381423_Advanced_Wavelet_Sampling_Algorithm_for_IoT_based_environmental_monitoring_and_management","abstract":"Presently, various high end systems have been utilized to check the instantaneous change in the climate through deep monitoring methods with advanced mathematical modelling, whereas the major problem in the present research is the data management and precision in detecting various disaster conditions of the smart environment. Though The present instrument for disaster prediction has come up with various satellites and radar, which suffers instrumentation and data management issues that has been resolved in this research. The prominent improvement in the IoT technology shows better fine-grain structure, more flexibility and accuracy. The Proposed technique uses Advanced Adaptive Wavelet Sampling Algorithm (AAWSA)that has been designed and developed in this paper helps to improve the precision range of the instrument during disaster prediction in the urban region. The developed instrument utilizes advanced mathematical modelling with the linear data analytics approach which shows emerging outcomes than the present system which are used in practice.","authors":["Zhang Tao"],"meta":["January 2020Computer Communications 150(7):547-555","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2019.12.006"],"references":["335211784_Research_outlook_and_state-of-the-art_methods_in_context_awareness_data_modeling_and_retrieval","333205435_Novel_Energy-Efficient_Data_Gathering_Scheme_Exploiting_Spatial-Temporal_Correlation_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","330653973_Analytical_Modelling_of_Power_Efficient_Reliable_Operation_of_Data_Fusion_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","326960115_A_Survey_on_the_Role_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_IoT_in_Disaster_Management","321474621_Environmental_Monitoring_and_Greenhouse_Control_by_Distributed_Sensor_Network","320885752_An_Energy_Efficient_Adaptive_Sampling_Algorithm_in_a_Sensor_Network_for_Automated_Water_Quality_Monitoring","280316988_Contextual_Sensing_Integrating_Contextual_Information_with_Human_and_Technical_Geo-Sensor_Information_for_Smart_Cities","278726450_Smart_City_Architecture_and_its_Applications_Based_on_IoT","271585638_The_Emerging_Internet_of_Things_Marketplace_From_an_Industrial_Perspective_A_Survey","228930348_Landslide_Monitoring_with_Sensor_Networks_a_Case_for_Autonomic_Communication_Services","223706985_Landslide_monitoring_by_using_ground-based_SAR_interferometry_An_example_of_application_to_the_Tessina_landslide_in_Italy","8329680_Building_Intelligent_Environments_with_Smart-Its","326500840_Energy_efficient_wireless_sensor_network_with_efficient_data_handling_for_real_time_landslide_monitoring_system_using_fuzzy_data_mining_technique","323860415_Edge-centric_field_monitoring_system_for_energy-efficient_and_network-friendly_field_sensing","321397719_An_Efficient-Energy_Data_Gathering_Method_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_EEDGM","320642756_Efficient_data_handling_of_wireless_sensor_network_for_real_time_landslide_monitoring_system_using_fuzzy_technique","298714240_Heuristic_approach_for_stagnation_free_energy_aware_routing_in_wireless_sensor_networks","220201557_Landslide_monitoring_with_sensor_networks_Experiences_and_lessons_learnt_from_a_real-world_deployment"]}
