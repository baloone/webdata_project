Founded in 2006 by Tracy Camp and Wendi Heinzelman, N2Women is a discipline-specific community for researchers in the communications and networking field. The main goal of N2Women is to foster connections among the underrepresented women in computer networking and related research fields. N2Women allows women to connect with other women who share the same research interests, who attend the same conferences, who face the same career hurdles, and who share common career objectives.","authors":["Katia Jaffres-Runser","Sami Rollins","Tracy Camp","Wendi Heinzelman"],"meta":["April 2017GetMobile Mobile Computing and Communications 20(4):12-16","DOI:10.1145/3081016.3081022"],"references":[]}
