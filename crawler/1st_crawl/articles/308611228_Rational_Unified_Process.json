{"id":"308611228_Rational_Unified_Process","abstract":"In this German seminar paper, which was written in the year 2011 at the University of Duisburg for a Bachelor Colloquium in Applied computer science, we show a brief overview of the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Thus, interested students or generally interested people in software development gain a first impression of RUP. The paper includes a survey and overview of the underlying process structure, the phases of the process, its workflows, and describes the always by the RUP developers postulated \"best practices\" of software development.","authors":["Nils Kopal"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":[]}
