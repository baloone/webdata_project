{"id":"268689488_Reverse_Engineering_Point_Clouds_to_Fit_Tensor_Product_B-Spline_Surfaces_by_Blending_Local_Fits","abstract":"Being able to reverse engineer from point cloud data to obtain 3D models is\nimportant in modeling. As our main contribution, we present a new method to\nobtain a tensor product B-spline representation from point cloud data by\nfitting surfaces to appropriately segmented data. By blending multiple local\nfits our method is more efficient than existing techniques, with the ability to\ndeal with more detail by efficiently introducing a high number of knots.\nFurther point cloud data obtained by digitizing 3D data, typically presents\nmany associated complications like noise and missing data. As our second\ncontribution, we propose an end-to-end framework for smoothing, hole filling,\nparameterization, knot selection and B-spline fitting that addresses these\nissues, works robustly with large irregularly shaped data containing holes and\nis straightforward to implement.","authors":["Lavanya Sita Tekumalla","Elaine Cohen"],"meta":["November 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239719132_A_Hole-Filling_Algorithm_for_Triangular_Meshes","228803922_Adaptive_B-spline_scheme_for_solving_an_inverse_scattering_problem","220954661_Reconstruction_of_B-spline_Surfaces_from_Scattered_Data_Points","4040989_A_hole-filling_strategy_for_reconstruction_of_smooth_surfaces_in_range_images","3410981_Computing_and_Rendering_Point_Set_Surfaces","2386519_Least_Squares_Cubic_Spline_Approximation_II_-_Variable_Knots","2309543_Interpolating_and_Approximating_Scattered_3D_Data_with_Hierarchical_Tensor_Product_Splines","290911547_Smooth_B-Spline_Surface_Approximation_to_Scattered_Data","285635492_Mesh-independent_surface_interpolation_in_Geometric_Modeling_for_Scientific_Visualization","262204809_Constructing_NURBS_surface_model_from_scattered_and_unorganized_range_data","242625561_Approximation_to_Data_by_Splines_with_Free_Knots","239066737_Mesh-Independent_Surface_Interpolation","222648680_Mean_Value_Coordinates_in_3D","222549684_Mean_Value_Coordinates","220852917_Signal-Specialized_Parametrization","220720571_Fitting_Smooth_Surfaces_to_Dense_Polygon_Meshes","220720431_Automatic_reconstruction_of_B-spline_surfaces_of_arbitrary_topological_type","220694264_Geometric_Modeling_with_Splines_An_Introduction","220690504_Fundamentals_of_Computer_Aided_Geometric_Design","200744528_Curve-fitting_with_piecewise_parametric_cubics"]}
