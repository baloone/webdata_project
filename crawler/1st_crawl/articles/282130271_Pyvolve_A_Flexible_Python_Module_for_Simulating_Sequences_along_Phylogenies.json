{"id":"282130271_Pyvolve_A_Flexible_Python_Module_for_Simulating_Sequences_along_Phylogenies","abstract":"We introduce Pyvolve, a flexible Python module for simulating genetic data along a phylogeny using continuous-time Markov models of sequence evolution. Easily incorporated into Python bioinformatics pipelines, Pyvolve can simulate sequences according to most standard models of nucleotide, amino-acid, and codon sequence evolution. All model parameters are fully customizable. Users can additionally specify custom evolutionary models, with custom rate matrices and/or states to evolve. This flexibility makes Pyvolve a convenient framework not only for simulating sequences under a wide variety of conditions, but also for developing and testing new evolutionary models. Pyvolve is an open-source project under a FreeBSD license, and it is available for download, along with a detailed user-manual and example scripts, from http://github.com/sjspielman/pyvolve.","authors":["Stephanie J Spielman","Claus O Wilke"],"meta":["September 2015PLoS ONE 10(9):e0139047","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139047"],"references":["274091474_Advances_in_Computer_Simulation_of_Genome_Evolution_Toward_More_Realistic_Evolutionary_Genomics_Analysis_by_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation","269999868_Antibody-Specific_Model_of_Amino_Acid_Substitution_for_Immunological_Inferences_from_Alignments_of_Antibody_Sequences","260371364_Simulation_of_Genome-Wide_Evolution_under_Heterogeneous_Substitution_Models_and_Complex_Multispecies_Coalescent_Histories","313123661_In_Munro_HN_ed_Mammalian_Protein_Metabolism","311100584_A_Model_of_Evolutionary_Change_in_Proteins","297177954_Lines-of-descent_and_genealogical_processes_and_their_applications_in_population_genetics_models","274725971_How_to_calculate_the_non-synonymous_to_synonymous_rate_ratio_of_protein-coding_genes_under_the_Fisher-Wright_mutation-selection_framework","273341237_CASS_Protein_sequence_simulation_with_explicit_genotype-phenotype_mapping","271534595_The_Relationship_between_dNdS_and_Scaled_Selection_Coefficients","260213542_A_Penalized-Likelihood_Method_to_Estimate_the_Distribution_of_Selection_Coefficients_from_Phylogenetic_Data"]}
