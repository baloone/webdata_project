{"id":"309529355_Relationship_among_Project_Management_Processes_and_Knowledge_Repository_for_Project_Success","abstract":"Knowledge repository is becoming a key factor within organizations as it can maximize the probability and impact of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) project success. Therefore, project management (PM) processes and knowledge repository are widely used in ICT projects to improve the degree of project success. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a model that defines how the combination of PM processes and knowledge repository would successfully support project success. This paper adapts the quantitative research approach by using the survey strategy which is conducted through questionnaires collected from 320 people working in ICT companies in Jordan. The researchers utilized the Smart Partial Least Square (PLS) as an analysis technique to test all hypotheses. The findings suggest that there is a positive effect of adapting the PM processes in improving the project success mediation by the knowledge repository.","authors":["Samer Alhawari"],"meta":["October 2016International Journal of Enterprise Information Systems 12(4):16-30","DOI:10.4018/IJEIS.2016100102"],"references":[]}
