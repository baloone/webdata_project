{"id":"297660313_Area-efficient_HEVC_IDCTIDST_architecture_for_8K4K_video_decoding","abstract":"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the newest video coding standard beyond H.264/AVC. To more efficiently compress image frames, variable block size DCT/IDCT (from 4×4 to 32×32) as well as 4×4 DST/IDST is employed by HEVC. In this paper, a novel area-efficient IDCT/IDST architecture for Ultra-High Definition (UHD) video applications is proposed. To reduce hardware cost and improve throughput efficiency, a novel resource sharing scheme, a template-based constant multiplication structure and a transpose buffer structure are adopted. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture can address 8K×4K (7680×4320, 30fps) video sequences at 390 MHz with at least a 39.5% gate count savings. Consequently, the proposed architecture offers a cost-efficient solution for future UHD applications.","authors":["Hong Liang","He Weifeng","Guanghui He","Mao Zhigang"],"meta":["March 2016IEICE Electronics Express 13(6)","DOI:10.1587/elex.13.20160019"],"references":["260712151_Efficient_integer_DCT_architectures_for_HEVC","274470467_A_full-pipelined_2-D_IDCTIDST_VLSI_architecture_with_adaptive_block-size_for_HEVC_standard","272398109_A_low_energy_HEVC_inverse_transform_hardware","269273665_Area_and_throughput_efficient_IDCTIDST_architecture_for_HEVC_standard","269273583_Power_efficient_and_high_troughtput_multi-size_IDCT_targeting_UHD_HEVC_decoders","261281484_High-performance_multiplierless_transform_architecture_for_HEVC","261230526_Fully_pipelined_DCTIDCTHadamard_unified_transform_architecture_for_HEVC_Codec","255568019_Overview_of_the_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding_HEVC_standard","254061275_HEVC_The_new_gold_standard_for_video_compression_How_does_HEVC_compare_with_H264AVC"]}
