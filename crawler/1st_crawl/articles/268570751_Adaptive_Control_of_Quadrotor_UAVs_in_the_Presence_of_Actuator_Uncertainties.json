{"id":"268570751_Adaptive_Control_of_Quadrotor_UAVs_in_the_Presence_of_Actuator_Uncertainties","abstract":"This paper describes the application of model reference adaptive control on a light-weight, low-cost quadrotor UAV platform. An adaptive controller was designed to augment an existing linear controller that provides autonomy and waypoint following. The design of the adaptive controller is driven by Lyapunov stability arguments and has a proof of stability grounded in a nonlinear framework. The approach was validated using flight testing inside an indoor test facility. The adaptive controller was found to offer increased robustness to parametric uncertainties. In particular, it was found to be effective in mitigating the effects of a loss of thrust anomaly, which may occur due to component failure or physical damage. The design of the adaptive controller is presented, followed by a comparison of flight test results using the existing linear and augmented adaptive controllers.","authors":["Zachary Dydek","Anuradha Annaswamy","Eugene Lavretsky"],"meta":["April 2010","DOI:10.2514/6.2010-3416","Conference: AIAA Infotech@Aerospace 2010"],"references":["4076717_Design_and_Control_of_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","269254515_Indoor_Multi-Vehicle_Flight_Testbed_for_Fault_Detection_Isolation_and_Recovery","269254292_Theoretically_Verifiable_Stability_Margins_for_an_Adaptive_Controller","245321273_Adaptive_Sliding_Controller_Synthesis_for_Non-Linear_Systems","227513808_High-order_sliding-mode_observer_for_a_quadrotor_UAV","224617295_Adaptation-based_reconguration_in_the_presence_of_actuator_failures_and_saturation","3029527_Stable_Model_Reference_Adaptive_Control_in_the_Presence_of_Bounded_Disturbances"]}
