{"id":"318422166_A_new_approach_for_time-lapse_data_weighting_in_ERT","abstract":"[en] Applications of timelapse inversion of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) allows\\\\monitoring variations in the subsurface that play a key role in a variety of contexts. The\\\\inversion of timelapse data provides successive images of the subsurface properties\\\\showing the medium evolution. Images quality is highly dependent on the data weighting determined from the data error estimates. However, the quantification of\\\\errors in the inversion of timelapse data has not yet been addressed. We propose a\\\\methodology for the quantification of timelapse data error based on the analysis of the\\\\discrepancy between normal and reciprocal readings acquired at different times. We\\\\apply the method to field monitoring data sets collected during the injection of heated\\\\water in a shallow aquifer. We tested different error models to show that the use of an\\\\appropriate time-lapse data error estimate yields significant improvements in terms of\\\\imaging. An adapted inversion weighting for time-lapse data implies that the procedure\\\\does not allow an over-fitting of the data, so the presence of artifacts in the resulting\\\\images is greatly reduced. Our results demonstrate that a proper estimate of time-lapse data error is mandatory for weighting optimally the inversion in order to obtain images that best reflect the medium properties evolution through time.","authors":["Nolwenn Lesparre","Frederic Nguyen","Andreas Kemna","Tanguy Robert"],"meta":["July 2017Geophysics 82(6):1-35","DOI:10.1190/geo2017-0024.1"],"references":["307858787_Direct_prediction_of_spatially_and_temporally_varying_physical_properties_from_time-lapse_electrical_resistance_data","277987906_Automated_monitoring_of_coastal_aquifers_with_electrical_resistivity_tomography","273682037_Characterization_of_seawater_intrusion_using_2D_electrical_imaging","259717491_Comparison_of_temperature_estimates_from_heat_transport_model_and_electrical_resistivity_tomography_during_a_shallow_heat_injection_and_storage_experiment","259658425_Case_studies_of_incorporation_of_prior_information_in_electrical_resistivity_tomography_Comparison_of_different_approaches","284669008_Regularised_image_reconstruction_of_noisy_electrical_resistance_tomography_data","277677522_Smoothness-constrained_time-lapse_inversion_of_data_from_3D_resistivity_surveys","266563003_Investigating_motion_blur_and_temporal_aliasing_from_time-lapse_electrical_resistivity","263042819_Monitoring_of_water_infiltration_in_weathered_clay_shale_slopes_with_Time-Lapse_Electrical_Resistivity_Tomography","261635457_Quantitative_temperature_monitoring_of_a_heat_tracing_experiment_using_cross-borehole_ERT"]}
