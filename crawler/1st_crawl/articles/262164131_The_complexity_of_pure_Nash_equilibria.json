{"id":"262164131_The_complexity_of_pure_Nash_equilibria","abstract":"We investigate from the computational viewpoint multi-player games that are guaranteed to have pure Nash equilibria. We focus on congestion games, and show that a pure Nash equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time in the symmetric network case, while the problem is PLS-complete in general. We discuss implications to non-atomic congestion games, and we explore the scope of the potential function method for proving existence of pure Nash equilibria.","authors":["Alex Fabrikant","Christos Papadimitriou","Kunal Talwar"],"meta":["June 2004","DOI:10.1145/1007352.1007445","SourceCiteSeer","Conference: Proceedings of the thirty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing"],"references":["230663805_Potential_Games","221498305_How_Easy_Is_Local_Search_Extended_Abstract","221344104_On_a_Network_Creation_Game","220618410_Polynomial_Methods_for_Separable_Convex_Optimization_in_Unimodular_Linear_Spaces_with_Applications","220617996_Simple_Local_Search_Problems_That_are_Hard_to_Solve","220617181_Faster_and_Simpler_Algorithms_for_Multicommodity_Flow_and_Other_Fractional_Packing_Problems","3880851_How_bad_is_selfish_routing_J_ACM","256221965_How_Easy_Is_Local_Search","242571807_Finding_Minimum-Cost_Circulations_by_Successive_Approximation","239552706_Coordination_Complexity_of_Parallel_Price-Directive_Decomposition","238742750_The_Traffic_Assignment_Problem_for_a_General_Network","230595730_Studies_in_Economics_of_Transportation","228673950_Long_lemke-howson_paths","226978608_The_Structure_and_Complexity_of_Nash_Equilibria_for_a_Selfish_Routing_Game","226074420_A_Class_of_Games_Possessing_Pure-Strategy_Nash_Equilibria","223058592_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Parity_Argument_and_Other_Inefficient_Proofs_of_Existence","222415817_Tardos_E_Bounding_the_inefficiency_of_equilibria_in_nonatomic_congestion_games_Games_and_Economic_Behavior_472_389-403","220617613_The_Complexity_of_the_Lin-Kernighan_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","200033990_Complexity_Results_about_Nash_Equilibria","7191091_Equilibrium_Points_in_N-Person_Games","5176514_Approximate_Local_Search_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","4952047_Congestion_Games_with_Player-Specific_Payoff_Functions","4004084_Nash_Equilibria_in_Competitive_Societies_with_Applications_to_Facility_Location_Traffic_Routing_and_Auctions","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","2412839_Computing_Equilibria_For_Two-Person_Games"]}
