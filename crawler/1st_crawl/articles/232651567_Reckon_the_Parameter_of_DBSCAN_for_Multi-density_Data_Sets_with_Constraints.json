{"id":"232651567_Reckon_the_Parameter_of_DBSCAN_for_Multi-density_Data_Sets_with_Constraints","abstract":"DBSCAN is a typical density-based clustering algorithm, but it is time-consuming to ascertain the parameter Eps and it does not perform well on multi-density datasets because of the global parameter Eps. In this paper, we use must-link constraints to ascertain the parameter Eps for each density distribution effectively and automatically, which will be used to deal with multi-density data sets for traditional DBSCAN algorithm. Experimental results reveal that our algorithm can reckon the parameter of DBSCAN for multi-density data sets with constraints effectively.","authors":["Tian-qiang Huang","Yang-qiang Yu","Kai Li","Wen-fu Zeng"],"meta":["November 2009","DOI:10.1109/AICI.2009.393"],"references":["221653902_Enhancing_semi-supervised_clustering_a_feature_projection_perspective","221344825_Intractability_and_clustering_with_constraints","220699147_Agglomerative_Hierarchical_Clustering_with_Constraints_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Results","200110876_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques_with_Java_Implementations","30876208_Data_Mining_-_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques_with_JAVA_Implementations","287173443_Constrained_k-means_Clustering_with_Background_Knowledge","224615355_Semi-Supervised_Fuzzy_Clustering_with_Pairwise-Constrained_Competitive_Agglomeration","221900847_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_And_Techniques","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","221345976_Constrained_K-means_Clustering_with_Background_Knowledge","2914686_Active_Semi-Supervision_for_Pairwise_Constrained_Clustering"]}
