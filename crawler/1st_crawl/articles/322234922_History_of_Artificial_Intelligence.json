{"id":"322234922_History_of_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is finding its way into ever more areas of life. The latest craze is AI chips and related applications on the smartphone. However, technology began as early as the 1950s with the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence at Dartmouth College, USA. The beginnings go even further back to the work of Alan Turing - which goes back to the well-known Turing test -, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. With the chess computer Deep Blue from IBM, which succeeded in 1996 as the first machine to beat the then-reigning chess world champion Garry Kasparov in a match, the artificial intelligence managed to get into the focus of the world public. In data centers and on mainframes, AI algorithms have been used for many years.","authors":["Maad M. Mijwil"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.16418.15046"],"references":[]}
