{"id":"271937664_Using_Games_and_Simulations_for_Supporting_Learning","abstract":"The growing interest in the use of games and simulations to support learning is evidenced in the literature, as well as in recent research projects and initiatives. While a focus upon the users of games and simulations is not well evidenced in the literature, this study aimed to highlight key issues and perceptions that inform and underpin how games and simulations were regarded by learners, tutors and experts using these tools. The paper highlights several key issues at stake in the wider debate about the validity of using games and simulations, including strengths of games to motivate learners, as well as scepticism about its efficacy as a learning tool. However, games and simulations are regarded as tools that may support differentiated learner groups including underserved learners, learners with skills needs (e.g. numeracy and literacy) and informal learners seeking to learn from experiences, as well as supporting collaborative learning practices. Furthermore, the majority of learners and tutors using games and simulations involved in the study did find value in using these tools as part of their wider learning and teaching practices.","authors":["Sara I. de Freitas"],"meta":["December 2006Learning Media and Technology 31(4):343-358","DOI:10.1080/17439880601021967"],"references":["245584260_Beyond_Edutainment_Exploring_the_Educational_Potential_of_Computer_Games","242298855_Chapter_Three_of_Media_Education_Literacy_Learning_and_Contemporary_Culture","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","221526733_Simulating_scenarios_for_research_on_culture_cognition_using_a_commercial_role-play_game","220686314_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","220374238_Simulations_and_the_Future_of_Learning_An_Innovative_and_Perhaps_Revolutionary_Approach_to_e-Learning","220349699_Game-Based_Learning_in_Universities_and_Lifelong_Learning_UniGame_Social_Skills_and_Knowledge_Training_Game_Concept","220116332_Personalizing_the_Interaction_in_a_Web-based_Educational_Hypermedia_System_the_case_of_INSPIRE","201381833_Games_Motivation_and_Learning_A_Research_and_Practice_Model","32231341_Literature_Review_in_Games_and_Learning","4119939_Using_Games_As_a_Means_for_Collaboration","283381077_Thinking_in_education_Second_edition","273077118_Data_Collection_and_Analysis","271232856_The_Blue_and_Brown_Books_Preliminary_Studies_for_the_Philosophical_Investigations","268745264_Frames_of_Mind_The_Theory_of_Multiple_Intelligences","263464382_Communities_of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity_CUP_Cambridge","248917253_Thinking_in_Education","248597371_From_Barbie_to_Mortal_Combat_Gender_and_Computer_Games","246670283_Learning_Styles_And_Pedagogy_In_Post-16_Learning_A_Systematic_And_Critical_Review","234812017_Serious_Games_Games_That_Educate_Train_and_Inform","233823058_Animal_Play_Evolutionary_Comparative_and_Ecological_Perspectives","233820959_Bright_Air_Brilliant_Fire_On_the_Matter_of_the_Mind","229673171_From_Viz-Sim_to_VR_to_Games_How_We_Built_a_Hit_Game-Based_Simulation","228971957_Savannah_Mobile_gaming_and_learning","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","222688850_How_can_exploratory_learning_with_games_and_simulations_within_the_curriculum_be_most_effectively_evaluated","222501811_Violent_video_games_and_aggression_A_review_of_the_literature","31760116_Rules_of_Play_Game_Design_Fundamentals_K_Salen_E_Zimmerman_prol_de_Frank_Lantz","30874037_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","15715437_The_effect_of_Type_A_personality_on_physiological_arousal_while_playing_computer_games","13827352_Video_games_and_clinical_practice_Issues_uses_and_treatments","10736871_Action_video_game_modifies_visual_selective_attention_Letter_to_the_Editor"]}
