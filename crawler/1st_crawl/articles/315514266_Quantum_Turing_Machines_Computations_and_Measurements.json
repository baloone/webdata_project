{"id":"315514266_Quantum_Turing_Machines_Computations_and_Measurements","abstract":"We propose a new formulation of Quantum Turing Ma- chines, as an extension of those proposed by Bernstein and Vazirani. For this new class of Quantum Turing Machines, both finite and infinite computations are meaningful -an infinite computation does not correspond trivially to a divergent function. Moreover, we propose a natural observation protocol for the new QTMs, that does not modify the probability of the possible outcomes of the machines. Finally, we use QTMs to define a class of quantum computable functions - any such a function is a mapping from a general quantum state to a distribution of probability of natural numbers.","authors":["Stefano Guerrini","Simone Martini","Andrea Masini"],"meta":["March 2017Applied Sciences 10(5551)","DOI:10.3390/app10165551"],"references":["320821183_Quantum_Programming_Made_Easy","313478567_QPCF_Higher-Order_Languages_and_Quantum_Circuits","274967383_Towards_A_Theory_Of_Quantum_Computability","258093126_Can_a_Universal_Quantum_Computer_Be_Fully_Quantum","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","301647465_A_Branching_Distributed_Temporal_Logic_for_Reasoning_about_Entanglement-Free_Quantum_State_Transformations","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","285777138_A_lambda_calculus_for_quantum_computation_with_classical_control","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","251791039_Quantum_computing_and_quantum_complexity_theory"]}
