{"id":"275669761_Algorithms_for_Non-Linear_and_Stochastic_Resource_Constrained_Shortest_Paths","abstract":"Resource constrained shortest path problems are usually solved by label\nalgorithms, which consist in a smart enumeration of the non-dominated paths.\nRecent improvements of these algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path\nresources to discard partial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines\nthe performance of the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to\nintroduce a standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a\ngeneral setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems,\namong which stochastic versions.\nIn that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained\nshortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource\nof a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists\nin finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of\nthe path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Label\nalgorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide\na polynomial procedure to find good quality bounds. The efficiency of the\napproach is proved through an extensive numerical study in the case of the\nStochastic Resource Constrained Shortest Path problem.","authors":["Axel Parmentier"],"meta":["April 2019Mathematical Methods of Operations Research 89(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00186-018-0649-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304925458_Constructive_versions_of_tarski's_fixed_point_theorems","275279894_Route_Planning_in_Transportation_Networks","325305621_Arriving-on-Time_Problem_Discrete_Algorithm_That_Ensures_Convergence","317732011_Aircraft_routing_and_crew_pairing_Updated_algorithms_at_Air_France","312980063_On_a_routing_problem","310515781_Route_Planning_in_Transportation_Networks","300267452_Resource_Constrained_Shortest_Paths_with_a_Super_Additive_Objective_Function","291783635_A_Generalized_Threshold_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Path_Problem_with_Time_Windows","290509244_Routing_Optimization_Under_Uncertainty","288007932_Solving_VRPTWs_with_constraint_programming_based_column_generation","267066746_A_New_Generation_of_Vehicle_Routing_Research_Robust_Algorithms_Addressing_Uncertainty","268493117_Lattices_and_Ordered_Algebraic_Structures","265679242_Transitivite_et_connexite","265425391_Maximal_Flow_Through_a_Network","265374157_On_a_Routing_Problem"]}
