{"id":"332312827_Maximum_Independent_and_Disjoint_Coverage","abstract":"Set Cover is one of the most studied optimization problems in Computer Science. In this paper, we target two interesting variations of this problem in a geometric setting: (i) Open image in new window , and (ii) Open image in new window problems. In both problems, the input consists of a set P of points and a set O of geometric objects in the plane. The objective is to maximize the number of points covered by a set \\(O'\\) of selected objects from O. In the MDC problem we restrict the objects in \\(O'\\) are pairwise disjoint (non-intersecting). Whereas, in the MIC problem any pair of objects in \\(O'\\) should not share a point from P (however, they may intersect each other). We consider various geometric objects as covering objects such as axis-parallel infinite lines, axis-parallel line segments, unit disks, axis-parallel unit squares, and intervals on a real line. For axis-parallel infinite lines both MDC and MIC problems admit polynomial time algorithms. On the other hand, we prove that the MIC problem is \\(\\mathsf {NP}\\)-complete when the objects are horizontal infinite lines and vertical segments. We also prove that both MDC and MIC problems are \\(\\mathsf {NP}\\)-complete for axis-parallel unit segments in the plane. For unit disks and axis-parallel unit squares, we prove that both these problems are \\(\\mathsf {NP}\\)-complete. Further, we present \\(\\mathsf {PTAS}\\)es for the MDC problem for unit disks as well as unit squares using Hochbaum and Maass’s “shifting strategy”. For unit squares, we design a \\(\\mathsf {PTAS}\\) for the MIC problem using Chan and Hu’s “mod-one transformation” technique. In addition to that, we give polynomial time algorithms for both MDC and MIC problems with intervals on the real line.","authors":["Amit Kumar Dhar","Raghunath reddy Madireddy","Supantha Pandit","Jagpreet Singh"],"meta":["March 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-14812-6_9","In book: Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (pp.134-153)"],"references":["220752576_A_Robust_PTAS_for_Maximum_Weight_Independent_Sets_in_Unit_Disk_Graphs","327829522_Hardness_Results_and_Approximation_Schemes_for_Discrete_Packing_and_Domination_Problems","305638716_Unique_Set_Cover_on_Unit_Disks_and_Unit_Squares","278393843_A_431-Approximation_for_the_Geometric_Unique_Coverage_Problem_on_Unit_Disks","269724665_Geometric_red-blue_set_cover_for_unit_squares_and_related_problems","259135781_Exact_algorithms_and_APX-hardness_results_for_geometric_packing_and_covering_problems","247153040_Approximation_Schemes_for_Maximum_Weight_Independent_Set_of_Rectangles","222469840_Unit_Disk_Graphs","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","220779848_Approximating_geometric_coverage_problems","220616707_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Geometric_Intersection_Graphs","220432249_Approximation_Schemes_for_Covering_and_Packing_Problems_in_Image_Processing_and_VLSI","50305747_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Pseudo-Disks","2323065_A_Threshold_of_Ln_N_for_Approximating_Set_Cover","1958872_Minimum-weight_triangulation_is_NP-hard"]}
