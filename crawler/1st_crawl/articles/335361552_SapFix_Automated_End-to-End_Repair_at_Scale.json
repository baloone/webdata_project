{"id":"335361552_SapFix_Automated_End-to-End_Repair_at_Scale","abstract":"We report our experience with SapFix: the first deployment of automated end-to-end fault fixing, from test case design through to deployed repairs in production code. We have used SapFix at Facebook to repair 6 production systems, each consisting of tens of millions of lines of code, and which are collectively used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.","authors":["Alexandru Marginean","Johannes Bader","Satish Chandra","Mark Harman"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2019.00039","Conference: 2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)Volume: 41"],"references":["329632790_Repairing_crashes_in_Android_apps","325728100_How_to_design_a_program_repair_bot_insights_from_the_repairnator_project","316469216_Genetic_Improvement_of_Software_A_Comprehensive_Survey","306090663_Exception_handling_bug_hazards_in_Android","305772994_Anti-patterns_in_Search-Based_Program_Repair","303296578_FSMdroid_guided_GUI_testing_of_android_apps","297777476_Nopol_Automatic_Repair_of_Conditional_Statement_Bugs_in_Java_Programs","288060022_NPEFix_Automatic_Runtime_Repair_of_Null_Pointer_Exceptions_in_Java","282333233_Automatic_Software_Repair_A_Bibliography","276255185_The_Oracle_Problem_in_Software_Testing_A_Survey","271769125_Tricorder_Building_a_Program_Analysis_Ecosystem","260493613_Development_and_Deployment_at_Facebook","254463862_The_GISMOE_challenge_Constructing_the_pareto_program_surface_using_genetic_programming_to_find_better_programs_Keynote_Paper","226660431_Scalable_Shape_Analysis_for_Systems_Code","224332299_Constructing_Subtle_Faults_Using_Higher_Order_Mutation_Testing","221051156_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_Techniques_Taxonomy_Tutorial","337151855_Deploying_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_with_Sapienz_at_Facebook","330717475_Separation_Logic","328904428_From_Start-ups_to_Scale-ups_Opportunities_and_Open_Problems_for_Static_and_Dynamic_Program_Analysis","327151045_Deploying_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_with_Sapienz_at_Facebook_10th_International_Symposium_SSBSE_2018_Montpellier_France_September_8-9_2018_Proceedings","324100898_Applied_Machine_Learning_at_Facebook_A_Datacenter_Infrastructure_Perspective","318578636_Making_Malory_Behave_Maliciously_Targeted_Fuzzing_of_Android_Execution_Environments","317328220_Achievements_open_problems_and_challenges_for_search_based_software_testing","317093810_Multi-objective_Search-based_Mobile_Testing","312829129_Moving_Fast_with_Software_Verification","309904908_Automated_concolic_testing_of_smartphone_apps","305026862_Sapienz_multi-objective_automated_testing_for_Android_applications","303284530_Automatic_patch_generation_by_learning_correct_code","303099279_Angelix_Scalable_Multiline_Program_Patch_Synthesis_via_Symbolic_Analysis","301428664_An_empirical_analysis_of_flaky_tests","299909645_Staged_program_repair_with_condition_synthesis","279835496_An_Analysis_of_Patch_Plausibility_and_Correctness_for_Generate-And-Validate_Patch_Generation_Systems","262868005_Search-Based_Software_Engineering","262395024_Search-Based_Software_Engineering_Trends_Techniques_and_Applications","262392393_Dynodroid_An_input_generation_system_for_Android_apps","262321195_Automated_testing_with_targeted_event_sequence_generation","262319515_Automated_Concolic_Testing_of_Smartphone_Apps","262164737_Targeted_and_Depth-first_Exploration_for_Systematic_Testing_of_Android_Apps","261417153_Large-Scale_Automated_Refactoring_Using_ClangMR","261230128_Automatic_patch_generation_learned_from_human-written_patches","261166224_SemFix_Program_repair_via_semantic_analysis","257665304_Current_challenges_in_automatic_software_repair","254463886_Using_GUI_ripping_for_automated_testing_of_Android_applications","224260841_GenProg_A_Generic_Method_for_Automatic_Software_Repair","222575770_Higher_Order_Mutation_Testing","221558301_Local_Reasoning_about_Programs_that_Alter_Data_Structures","221555634_Program_Slicing","221555359_Oracle-guided_component-based_program_synthesis","221553516_Automatically_finding_patches_using_genetic_programming","221108658_Patches_as_Better_Bug_Reports","220910210_Automatically_Patching_Errors_in_Deployed_Software","220069671_An_Analysis_and_Survey_of_the_Development_of_Mutation_Testing","216667096_Are_Automated_Debugging_Techniques_Actually_Helping_Programmers","220854467_Blended_analysis_for_performance_understanding_of_framework-based_applications","220516273_Search-based_software_test_data_generation_a_survey_Research_Articles"]}
