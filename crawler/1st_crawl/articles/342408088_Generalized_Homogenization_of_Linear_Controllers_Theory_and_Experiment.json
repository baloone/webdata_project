{"id":"342408088_Generalized_Homogenization_of_Linear_Controllers_Theory_and_Experiment","abstract":"A procedure for an “upgrade” of a linear proportional‐integral‐differential (PID) controller to a nonlinear homogeneous one is developed and verified by real experiments with quadrotor. The controller design is based on a generalized homogeneity (dilation symmetry) of the system. Its parameters are obtained from the gains of linear controller. The issues of digital implementation of the proposed controller are discussed. Finally, the stability and robustness properties of the homogeneous PID controller are validated on the quadrotor QDrone platform of QuanserTM .","authors":["Siyuan Wang","Andrey Polyakov","Gang Zheng"],"meta":["August 2020International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control 31(1)","DOI:10.1002/rnc.5112"],"references":["328869353_Consistent_Discretization_of_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Stable_Systems","322693478_On_Homogeneous_Finite-Time_Control_for_Linear_Evolution_Equation_in_Hilbert_Space","339901556_Integral_Control_Design_using_the_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach","339045693_Generalized_Homogeneity_in_Systems_and_Control","338845025_Robust_Feedback_Stabilization_of_Linear_MIMO_Systems_Using_Generalized_Homogenization","332031500_Quadrotor_Control_Design_under_Time_and_State_Constraints_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach","323725551_Discontinuous_systems_Lyapunov_analysis_and_robust_synthesis_under_uncertainty_conditions","323723574_Control_of_nonlinear_dynamical_systems_Methods_and_applications","322883826_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_Using_Canonical_Homogeneous_Norm","321149997_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Observer_Design_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach"]}
