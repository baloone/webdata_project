{"id":"225759827_Scientific_research_competitiveness_of_world_universities_in_computer_science","abstract":"This article evaluates the scientific research competitiveness of world universities in computer science. The data source\nis the Essential Science Indicator (ESI) database with a time span of more than 10 years, from 01/01/1996 to 08/31/2006. We\nestablish a hierarchical indicator system including four primary indicators which consist of scientific research production,\ninfluence, innovation and development and six secondary indicators which consist of the number of papers, total citations,\nhighly cited papers, hot papers, average citations per paper and the ration of highly cited papers to papers. Then we assign\nthem with proper weights. Based on these, we obtain the rankings of university and country/territory competitiveness in computer\nscience. We hope this paper can contribute to the further study in the evaluation of a certain subject or a whole university.","authors":["Ruimin ma","Chaoqun Ni","Junping Qiu"],"meta":["August 2008Scientometrics 76(2):245-260","DOI:10.1007/s11192-007-1913-7"],"references":["242916183_Advanced_bibliometric_methods_for_the_evaluation_of_Universities","228666047_Research_evaluation_of_research-oriented_universities_in_Taiwan_from_1993_to_2003","226445171_Research_performance_indicators_for_university_departments_A_study_of_an_agricultural_university","225490234_Impact_measures_of_interdisciplinary_research_in_physics","220365467_The_Holy_Grail_of_science_policy_Exploring_and_combining_bibliometric_tools_in_search_of_scientific_excellence","220365310_Fatal_attraction_Conceptual_and_methodological_problems_in_the_ranking_of_universities_by_bibliometric_methods","220364977_The_Application_of_Bibliometric_Analyses_in_the_Evaluation_of_Social_Science_Research_Who_Benefits_from_it_and_Why_it_is_Still_Feasible","220364860_Comparisonof_the_Hirsch-index_with_standard_bibliometric_indicators_and_with_peerjudgmentfor147_chemistry_research_groups","220364588_Competition_for_funding_as_an_indicator_of_research_competitiveness","2174529_Comparison_of_the_Hirsch-index_with_standard_bibliometric_indicators_and_with_peer_judgment","290528390_Research_evaluation_of_research-oriented_universities_in_Taiwan","242915708_A_validation_study_of_bibliometric_indicators_The_comparative_performance_of_cum_laude_doctorates_in_chemistry","220365443_Assessment_of_research_performance_in_food_science_and_technology_Publication_behavior_of_five_Iberian-American_countries_1992-2003","220364830_Bibliometric_Monitoring_of_Research_Performance_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_the_Humanities_A_Review","7530629_Bibliometric_Methods_Pitfalls_and_Possibilities","4751725_Evaluating_The_Research_Output_Of_Australian_Universities'_Economics_Departments"]}
