{"id":"323796429_Generalized_Proximal_Smoothing_for_Phase_Retrieval","abstract":"In this paper, we report the development of the generalized proximal smoothing (GPS) algorithm for phase retrieval of noisy data. GPS is a optimization-based algorithm, in which we relax both the Fourier magnitudes and object constraints. We relax the object constraint by introducing the generalized Moreau-Yosida regularization and heat kernel smoothing. We are able to readily handle the associated proximal mapping in the dual variable by using an infimal convolution. We also relax the magnitude constraint into a least squares fidelity term, whose proximal mapping is available. GPS alternatively iterates between the two proximal mappings in primal and dual spaces, respectively. Using both numerical simulation and experimental data, we show that GPS algorithm consistently outperforms the classical phase retrieval algorithms such as hybrid input-output (HIO) and oversampling smoothness (OSS), in terms of the convergence speed, consistency of the phase retrieval, and robustness to noise.","authors":["Minh Pham","Penghang Yin","Arjun Rana","Stanley Osher"],"meta":["March 2018Optics Express 27(3)","DOI:10.1364/OE.27.002792"],"references":["322634518_BinaryRelax_A_Relaxation_Approach_For_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_With_Quantized_Weights","322412251_Variational_Phase_Retrieval_with_Globally_Convergent_Preconditioned_Proximal_Algorithm","305658701_Phase_Retrieval_from_Incomplete_Magnitude_Information_Via_Total_Variation_Regularization","327052935_On_the_equivalence_of_the_primal-dual_hybrid_gradient_method_and_Douglas-Rachford_splitting","316801098_Functional_Analysis","313876742_Proximiteet_dualite_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","312113257_Self_Equivalence_of_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","308168354_On_the_numerical_solution_of_heat_conduction_problems_in_two_and_three_space_variables","283294219_FOURIER_PHASE_RETRIEVAL_WITH_A_SINGLE_MASK_BY_THE_DOUGLAS-RACHFORD_ALGORITHM","275664539_Beyond_crystallography_Diffractive_imaging_using_coherent_X-ray_light_sources"]}
