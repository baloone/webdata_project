{"id":"222146847_Passive_detection_of_doctored_JPEG_image_via_block_artifact_grid_extraction","abstract":"It has been noticed that the block artifact grids (BAG), caused by the blocking processing during JPEG compression, are usually mismatched when interpolating or concealing objects by copyâ€“paste operations. In this paper, the BAGs are extracted blindly with a new extraction algorithm, and then abnormal BAGs can be detected with a marking procedure. Then the phenomenon of grid mismatch or grid blank can be taken as a trail of such forensics. Experimental results show that our method can mark these trails efficiently.","authors":["Weihai Li","Yuan Yuan","Nenghai Yu"],"meta":["September 2009Signal Processing 89(9):1821-1829","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.03.025","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242075449_A_generalized_Benford's_law_for_JPEG_coefficients_and_its_applications_in_image_forensics_-_art_no_65051L","232628397_DCT-Domain_Blind_Measurement_Of_Blocking_Artifacts_In_DCT-Coded_Images","220942155_Exposing_Digital_Forgeries_by_Detecting_Incon_sistencies_in_Lighting","4266569_Detecting_Digital_Image_Forgeries_by_Measuring_Inconsistencies_of_Blocking_Artifact","3455403_Detection_of_Double-Compression_in_JPEG_Images_for_Applications_in_Steganography","3455253_Digital_Camera_Identification_From_Sensor_Pattern_Noise","278133510_Dual_protection_of_JPEG_images_based_on_informed_embedding_and_two-stage_watermark_extraction_techniques","271612811_A_locally_adaptive_algorithm_for_measuring_blocking_artifacts_in_images_and_videos","228756981_Estimation_of_primary_quantization_matrix_in_double_compressed_JPEG_images","225180603_Detecting_doctored_JPEG_images_via_DCT_coefficient_analysis","224751606_Blind_Detection_of_Photomontage_Using_Higher_Order_Statistics","220307239_A_locally_adaptive_algorithm_for_measuring_blocking_artifacts_in_images_and_videos","220183610_Image_completion_with_structure_propagation","5613838_Identification_of_bitmap_compression_history_JPEG_detection_and_quantizer_estimation","4365592_Doctored_JPEG_image_detection","4285713_A_Statistical_Analysis_on_Differential_Signals_for_Noise_Level_Estimation","4156276_Detecting_Doctored_Images_Using_Camera_Response_Normality_and_Consistency","3455261_Dual_Protection_of_JPEG_Images_Based_on_Informed_Embedding_and_Two-Stage_Watermark_Extraction_Techniques","3319434_Exposing_Digital_Forgeries_in_Color_Filter_Array_Interpolated_Images","2903827_Statistical_Tools_for_Digital_Forensics"]}
