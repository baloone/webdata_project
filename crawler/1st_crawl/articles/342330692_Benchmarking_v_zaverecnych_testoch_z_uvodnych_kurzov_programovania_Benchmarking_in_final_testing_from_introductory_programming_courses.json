This benchmarking is based on a set of 10 specified programming questions in modifications for programming languages Python, Java or C — according to a programming language taught in their own institution. We started to cooperate with authors of these questions at two Slovak universities in 2016/17 academic year. We have prepared a version for C programming language with instructions in Slovak language. We present these programming tasks in this article so they could be used by teachers in first programming courses at universities and at secondary vocational schools as well.\nhttp://www.omfi.ukf.sk/?page=author&kind=single&ID=420\nObzory matematiky, fyziky a informatiky = Horizons of mathematics, physics and computer sciences.
