{"id":"300177721_Image_Mosaicing","abstract":"Image mosaicing is the alignment of multiple images into larger compositions which represent portions of a 3D scene. The mosaicing methods described in this chapter are concerned with images which can be registered by means of a planar homography: views of a planar scene from arbitrary viewpoints, or views of a scene taken by a rotating camera. There are three important factors to consider when constructing a mosaic: the estimation of a set of homographies which are consistent over all the views; the choice of reprojection manifold on which the images are composited; and the choice of algorithm for blending the overlapping images.","authors":["Dr David Capel"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1007/978-0-85729-384-8_4","In book: Image Mosaicing and Super-resolution (pp.47-79)"],"references":["228950688_Panoramic_Imaging_with_Horizontal_Stereo"]}
