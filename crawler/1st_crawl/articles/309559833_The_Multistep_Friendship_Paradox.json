{"id":"309559833_The_Multistep_Friendship_Paradox","abstract":"The friendship paradox, proved by Feld in 1991, states that “on average, your friends have more friends than you do.” In fact, Feld proved two versions of the paradox. We discuss generalizations of each of them that talk about the average number of friends that, for instance, a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend has.","authors":["Josh Brown Kramer","Jonathan Cutler","Andrew J.
