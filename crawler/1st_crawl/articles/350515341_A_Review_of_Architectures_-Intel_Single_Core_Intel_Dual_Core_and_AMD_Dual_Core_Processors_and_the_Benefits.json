As a result, hardware architects have begun to design microprocessors with multiple processing cores that operate independently and share the same address space. However, increasing the number of cores on a single chip, generate a lot of challenges that arises with memory and cache coherence as well as communication between the cores. AMD and Intel have found solution to this problem by redesigning the processor architecture differently by putting multiple CPU cores on a chip. This paper describes the architecture of single core and Multi core processor technology","authors":["Ayodeji Fasiku","J B Olawale","O T Jinadu"],"meta":["May 2012International Journal of Engineering and Technology 2(5):809-817"],"references":[]}
