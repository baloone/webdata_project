{"id":"271743591_Computing_and_Experiments","abstract":"The question about the scientific nature of computing has been widely debated with no universal consensus reached about its disciplinary status. Positions vary from acknowledging computing as the science of computers to defining it as a synthetic engineering discipline. In this paper, we aim at discussing the nature of computing from a methodological perspective. We consider, in particular, the nature and role of experiments in this field, whether they can be considered close to the traditional experimental scientific method or, instead, they possess peculiar and unique features. We argue that this experimental perspective should be taken into account when discussing the status of computing. We critically survey how the experimental method has been conceived and applied in computing, and some open issues that could be tackled with the aid of the history of science, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of technology.","authors":["Viola Schiaffonati","Mario Verdicchio"],"meta":["September 2013Philosophy & Technology 27(3):359-376","DOI:10.1007/s13347-013-0126-7","Project: Ethics and Philosophy of Computer Science"],"references":["303911071_Philosophy_of_Technology","224711681_Putting_Reproducible_Signal_Processing_into_Practice_A_Case_Study_in_Watermarking","224402100_Reproducible_Research_in_Signal_Processing","221051163_Replication_of_Software_Engineering_Experiments","220636751_Three_Paradigms_of_Computer_Science","220474017_An_insightful_comparison_between_experiments_in_mobile_robotics_and_in_science","220427301_Turing_Award_Lecture_On_Computational_Complexity_and_the_Nature_of_Computer_Science","220422033_Rejuvenating_Experimental_Computer_Science_-_A_Report_to_the_National_Science_Foundation_and_Others","220419745_Computer_Science_Can_Use_More_Science","220277744_An_empirical_study_on_the_efficiency_of_different_design_pattern_representations_in_UML_class_diagrams","41015809_The_philosophy_of_scientific_experimentation","303148057_Computer_Science_and_Philosophy","279159624_A_Philosophy_of_Technology_From_Technical_Artefacts_to_Sociotechnical_Systems","274501164_The_Aim_and_Structure_of_Physical_Theory","272088622_Sciences_of_The_Artificial","269444381_Representing_and_Intervening_Introductory_Topics_in_the_Philosophy_of_Natural_Science","250141163_Experimental_Computer_Science_The_Need_for_a_Cultural_Change","249197136_The_Copernican_Revolution_Planetary_Astronomy_in_the_Development_of_Modern_Thought","247392303_Representing_and_Intervening_Introductory_Topics_in_the_Philosophy_of_Natural_Science","245577583_Autonomous_Navigation_and_Map_building_Using_Laser_Range_Sensors_in_Outdoor_Applications","243386922_The_Construction_of_Modern_Science_Mechanisms_and_Mechanics","239581491_Computer_programs_for_checking_mathematical_proofs","239561051_Rejuvenating_experimental_computer_science","235709745_Experiment_in_Physics","234832814_ACM_President's_Letter_What_is_experimental_computer_science","234798819_ACM_president's_letter_performance_analysis_experimental_computer_science_as_its_best","234795002_Research_paradigms_in_computer_science","234617489_Computer_Science_Is_an_Engineering_Discipline","228051440_Methodology_of_Computer_Science","222488679_Experimental_validation_in_software_engineering","220694532_Basics_of_Software_Engineering_Experimentation","220636822_Computing_as_a_Science_A_Survey_of_Competing_Viewpoints","220478735_Computing_as_a_discipline","220474318_Guest_editorial_Special_issue_on_characterizing_mobile_robot_localization_and_mapping","220427741_Back_to_experimentation","220427542_Computer_Science_as_Empirical_Inquiry_Symbols_and_Search","220427532_Computing_is_a_natural_science","220425905_Is_computer_science_science","220425710_The_Computer_Scientist_as_Toolsmith_II","220425189_An_ACM_Executive_Committee_Position_on_the_Crisis_in_Experimental_Computer_Science","220421670_The_profession_of_IT_Computing's_paradigm","220421455_Viewpoint_Computer_and_Information_Science_and_Engineering_One_Discipline_Many_Specialties","220349972_Computing_as_Engineering","220343891_Machine_Learning_as_an_Experimental_Science","200680168_Computer_programming_as_an_art","50334280_The_Aim_and_Structure_of_Physical_Theory","48201305_Computing_The_Fourth_Great_Domain_of_Science","39788534_The_Discovery_of_Neptune","37688684_Theory_and_Reality_An_Introduction_to_Philosophy_of_Science","31089158_WHAT_MAKES_A_'GOOD'_EXPERIMENT","2954936_Experimental_Models_for_Validating_Technology","2954925_Should_Computer_Scientists_Experiment_More","30875102_The_Sciences_of_Artificial","17148133_Computer_Science","3321639_Pushing_science_into_signal_processing"]}
