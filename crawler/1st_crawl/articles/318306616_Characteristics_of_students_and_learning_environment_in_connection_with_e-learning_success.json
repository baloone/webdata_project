{"id":"318306616_Characteristics_of_students_and_learning_environment_in_connection_with_e-learning_success","abstract":"In nowadays schools, more and more electronic or e-textbooks are emerging, while it has not yet been sufficiently studied how to use them in teaching and independent learning in order to be as successful as possible. In this article, we present how teacher's instructions and some characteristics of the students in learning from e-textbooks (skills of self-regulated learning, prior knowledge, attitudes towards and the experience with e-textbooks) can predict the success of this kind of learning. The study involved 83 first year high school students, who independently learnedfrom the geography e-textbook, and two geography teachers. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that with the included variables we can explain 40% of differences in academic achievements of students by e-leaming. In doing so, the greatest predictive power for understanding the learning content by learning with e-textbooks had the students' prior knowledge of the content, previous experience with e-textbooks, test anxiety of the students, and teacher's instructions for a skilful handling of the e-tex/book's interactive elements.","authors":["Anja Poznič","Sonja Pečjak"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["317214024_The_mediating_effects_of_germane_cognitive_load_on_the_relationship_between_instructional_design_and_students'_future_behavioral_intention","311998972_Instructional_Scaffolding_in_STEM_Education","305490989_The_Effects_of_Instructor_Control_of_Online_Learning_Environments_on_Satisfaction_and_Perceived_Learning","287637751_Exploring_the_factors_influencing_e-learning_of_Turkish_EFL_learners_through_TAM","283456791_Students'_Attitudes_towards_Information_Technology_and_the_Relationship_with_their_Academic_Achievement","283254867_Interactive_multimedia_learning_Innovating_classroom_education_in_a_Malaysian_university","279179074_Evidence_for_the_Latent_Factor_Structure_of_the_MSLQ_A_New_Conceptualization_of_an_Established_Questionnaire","277799176_Factor_Validity_of_the_Motivated_Strategies_for_Learning_Questionnaire_MSLQin_Asynchronous_Online_Learning_Environments","271429287_A_Manual_for_the_Use_of_the_Motivated_Strategies_for_Learning_Questionnaire_MSLQ","257171412_Electronic_versus_traditional_print_textbooks_A_comparison_study_on_the_influence_of_university_students'_learning","241037549_Expertise_Differences_in_the_Comprehension_of_Visualizations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Eye-Tracking_Research_in_Professional_Domains","237065878_Becoming_a_Self-Regulated_Learner_An_Overview","228749393_Assessing_Teaching_Presence_in_a_Computer_Conferencing_Context","225644811_Learning_from_animation_enabled_by_collaboration","51062331_Implementation_of_training_programs_in_self-regulated_learning_strategies_in_Moodle_format_Results_of_a_experience_in_higher_education","297764973_Development_and_effectiveness_analysis_of_a_personalized_ubiquitous_multi-device_certification_tutoring_system_based_on_bloom's_taxonomy_of_educational_objectives","292342169_The_adoption_of_mark-up_tools_in_an_interactive_e-textbook_reader","289319947_Evaluating_the_impacts_of_ICT_use_A_multi-level_analysis_with_hierarchical_linear_modeling","281219244_A_Meta_-_analysis_of_e-_learning_effectiveness_antecedent","277805284_Reading_Engagement_A_Comparison_between_E-Books_and_Traditional_Print_Books_in_an_Elementary_Classroom","277681086_IMPROVING_LEARNING_THROUGHPUT_IN_E-LEARNING_USING_INTERACTIVE-COGNITIVE_BASED_ASSESSMENT","268283651_Elementary_school_teachers'_ICT_use_in_the_classroom_and_their_motivators_for_using_ICT","257171472_E-textbooks_at_what_cost_Performance_and_use_of_electronic_v_print_texts","253934957_New_Teacher_and_Student_Roles_in_the_Technology-Supported_Classroom","241767833_Relationships_Among_Learning_Strategies_Patterns_Styles_And_Achievement_In_Web-Based_Courses","240162103_Development_of_metacognitive_skillfulness_A_longitudinal_study","233820393_Social_Foundations_of_Thought_Action_A_Social_Cognitive_Theory","230613164_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_the_Motivated_Strategies_for_Learning_Questionnaire","225923409_Comparison_of_Earth_Science_Achievement_Between_Animation-Based_and_Graphic-Based_Testing_Designs","223216039_What_is_important_in_electronic_textbooks_for_students_of_different_achievement_level","47514676_Not_on_the_Same_Page_Undergraduates'_Information_Retrieval_in_Electronic_and_Print_Books","44828922_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_a_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives"]}
