{"id":"338301435_Mapeando_com_robos","abstract":"Physics is typically introduced to students through kinematics. In general, students learn to solve simple examples, for example, how to find the time of a journey from one position to another one. With the popularization of computer science, it is important to present problems which can be analyzed playfully on the computer. With this objective, through simulations, we study different strategies for the kinematics of a robot that must map a room. The efficiencies of the different strategies were compared by calculating some quantities from the trajectories, such as Convex Hull and Entropy. Comparing these quantities, it is possible to discuss the mapping performed by each one of them.","authors":["Gabriel Alves Machado","Angelo Mondaini Calvão"],"meta":["January 2020Revista Brasileira de Ensino de Física 42","DOI:10.1590/1806-9126-rbef-2019-0226"],"references":["283995965_Estimating_uncertain_spatial_relationships_in_robotics","268644971_The_Self-Avoiding_Walk","246857904_Modern_Differential_Geometry_of_Curves_and_Surfaces_with_Mathematica","234993767_Shape_of_a_Self-Avoiding_Walk_or_Polymer_Chain","220022167_Information_Theory_and_Statistical_Mechanics_I","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication"]}
