{"id":"286089627_Delivery_Delay_Analysis_for_Roadside_Unit_Deployment_in_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_with_Intermittent_Connectivity","abstract":"This paper studies the information delivery delay analysis for roadside unit deployment in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) with intermittent connectivity. A mathematical model is developed to describe the relationship between the average delay for delivering road condition information and the distance between two neighbor RSUs deployed along a road. The derived mathematical model considers a straight highway scenario where two RSUs are deployed at a distance without any direct connection and vehicles are sparsely distributed on the road with road condition information randomly generated between the two neighbor RSUs. Moreover, the model takes into account the vehicle speed, the vehicle density, the likelihood of an incident, and the distance between two RSUs. The effectiveness of the derived mathematical model is verified through simulation results. Given the information delivery delay constraint of a time-critical application, this model can be used to estimate the maximum distance allowed between two neighbor RSUs, which can provide a reference for the deployment of RSUs in such scenarios.","authors":["Yu wang","jun zheng","Nathalie Mitton"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 65(99)","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2015.2506599","Project: vehicular"],"references":["276134070_Accurate_Probability_Distribution_of_Rehealing_Delay_in_Sparse_VANETs","260667977_Which_Vehicle_To_Select","233893835_Modeling_and_Delay_Analysis_of_a_Retransmission-Based_Bundle_Delivery_Scheme_for_Intermittent_Roadside_Communication_Networks","267637392_Parameters_that_Affect_Safety_Message_Delay_in_Sparse_Infrastructure-less_Vehicular_Networks","263813589_Deploying_Roadside_Units_in_Sparse_Vehicular_Networks_What_Really_Works_and_What_Does_Not","261207433_Probability_of_multi-hop_message_dissemination_in_sparse_linear_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","260711753_Access_Points_Planning_in_Urban_Area_for_Data_Dissemination_to_Drivers","260703963_Delay_Analysis_for_Sparse_Vehicular_Sensor_Networks_with_Reliability_Considerations","260582677_Modeling_and_Delay_Analysis_of_Intermittently_Connected_Roadside_Communication_Networks","245586928_Optimal_roadside_units_placement_along_highways"]}
