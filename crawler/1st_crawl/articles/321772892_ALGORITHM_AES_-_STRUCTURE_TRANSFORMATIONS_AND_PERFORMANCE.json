{"id":"321772892_ALGORITHM_AES_-_STRUCTURE_TRANSFORMATIONS_AND_PERFORMANCE","abstract":"Todayâ€™s cryptographic algorithms are designed in a way that they combine mathematical theory and practice of computer science in order to improve resistance to cryptanalysis. Cryptographic algorithms are designed around the binary data format keeping in mind the presumption of hardening possibility of cracking the algorithm. One of the algorithms whose resistance to cryptanalysis during the past 16 years is extensively tested algorithm AES. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the first cryptographic standard aroused as the result of public competition established by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). AES has emerged as restriction on winner of this competition, called Rijndael algorithm on the block size of 128 bits. From the moment of its acceptance of the standard in 2001, testing and research of its resistance on cryptanalysis and research focused on improving its performance are made. This paper presents a detailed overview of the algorithm AES, together with all its transformations and with ideas to speed up its work.","authors":["Boris Damjanovic"],"meta":["December 2017AKTUELNOSTI 3(36)","DOI:10.7251/AKT1636001D"],"references":["288480385_Tweakable_parallel_OFB_mode_of_operation_with_delayed_thread_synchronization","245077369_A_Specification_for_Rijndael_the_AES_Algorithm","225127628_A_Compact_Rijndael_Hardware_Architecture_with_S-Box_Optimization","224561575_Design_of_a_parallel_AES_for_graphics_hardware_using_the_CUDA_framework","285933688_Computer_Security_and_Cryptography","267299924_Comparative_Analysis_of_AES_and_RC4_Algorithms_for_Better_Utilization","234808644_The_Design_of_Rijndael","224616484_An_AES_crypto_chip_using_a_high-speed_parallel_pipelined_architecture","224363317_CUDA_compatible_GPU_as_an_efficient_hardware_accelerator_for_AES_Cryptography","224213275_AES_encryption_implementation_on_CUDA_GPU_and_its_analysis","50996668_Performance_Evaluation_of_Symmetric_Encryption_Algorithms","220775742_Parallel_Execution_of_AES-CTR_Algorithm_Using_Extended_Block_Size","220760263_An_FPGA-based_Performance_Analysis_of_the_Unrolling_Tiling_and_Pipelining_of_the_AES_Algorithm","220686627_A_new_methodology_to_implement_the_AES_algorithm_using_partial_and_dynamic_reconfiguration","40422724_AES_Implementation_and_Performance_Evaluation_on_8-bit_Microcontrollers"]}
