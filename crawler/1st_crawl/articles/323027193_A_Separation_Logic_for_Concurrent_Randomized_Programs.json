{"id":"323027193_A_Separation_Logic_for_Concurrent_Randomized_Programs","abstract":"We present a concurrent separation logic with support for probabilistic reasoning. As part of our logic, we extend the idea of coupling, which underlies recent work on probabilistic relational logics, to the setting of programs with both probabilistic and non-deterministic choice. To demonstrate our logic, we verify a variant of a recent randomized concurrent counter algorithm. All of our results have been mechanized in Coq.","authors":["Joseph Tassarotti","Robert Harper"],"meta":["February 2018Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 3(POPL)","DOI:10.1145/3290377"],"references":["324519731_Relational_Reasoning_for_Markov_Chains_in_a_Probabilistic_Guarded_Lambda_Calculus","323471134_Quantitative_Separation_Logic","316617931_-Liftings_for_Differential_Privacy","312620151_Proving_uniformity_and_independence_by_self-composition_and_coupling","301846904_A_program_logic_for_union_bounds","281768739_Relational_Reasoning_via_Probabilistic_Coupling","267339974_Full_Abstraction_for_Non-Deterministic_and_Probabilistic_Extensions_of_PCF_I_the_Angelic_Cases","264394320_TaDA_A_Logic_for_Time_and_Data_Abstraction","262323417_Scalable_Statistics_Counters","259901424_Communicating_State_Transition_Systems_for_Fine-Grained_Concurrent_Resources","249902280_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List","242488657_Modular_fine-grained_concurrency_verification","234800126_Tentative_Steps_Toward_a_Development_Method_for_Interfering_Programs","225112158_Reasoning_about_Optimistic_Concurrency_Using_a_Program_Logic_for_History","222565011_On_Combining_Probability_and_Nondeterminism","222425676_Semantic_Domains_for_Combining_Probability_and_Non-Determinism","221558049_Continuous_Previsions","332089181_Certified_Programming_with_Dependent_Types_A_Pragmatic_Introduction_to_the_Coq_Proof_Assistant","326026925_ReLoC_A_Mechanised_Relational_Logic_for_Fine-Grained_Concurrency","320707110_Probabilistic_Couplings_for_Probabilistic_Reasoning","316899254_A_relational_model_of_types-and-effects_in_higher-order_concurrent_separation_logic","316898738_Coupling_proofs_are_probabilistic_product_programs","315341494_The_Essence_of_Higher-Order_Concurrent_Separation_Logic","312594297_A_Higher-Order_Logic_for_Concurrent_Termination-Preserving_Refinement","312013353_A_relational_model_of_types-and-effects_in_higher-order_concurrent_separation_logic","311491529_Adding_approximate_counters","311482791_Higher-order_ghost_state","310824189_Higher-order_ghost_state","309333284_Hoare-Style_Specifications_as_Correctness_Conditions_for_Non-linearizable_Concurrent_Objects","305264760_Weakest_Precondition_Reasoning_for_Expected_Run-Times_of_Probabilistic_Programs","305229074_Coupling_proofs_are_probabilistic_product_programs","291411519_Views","282926793_Iris_Monoids_and_Invariants_as_an_Orthogonal_Basis_for_Concurrent_Reasoning","281354604_Proofs_of_randomized_algorithms_in_CoQ","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","274202865_Just_do_it","270906543_Step-Indexed_Logical_Relations_for_Probability_long_version","267672965_Program_logics_for_certified_compilers","267437355_Certified_programming_with_dependent_types_A_pragmatic_introduction_to_the_Coq_proof_assistant","266913111_The_Foundational_Cryptography_Framework","265295379_Probabilistic_Rely-guarantee_Calculus","262291891_Probabilistic_Relational_Hoare_Logics_for_Computer-Aided_Security_Proofs","262287363_Views_Compositional_Reasoning_for_Concurrent_Programs","262203648_Unifying_Refinement_and_Hoare-Style_Reasoning_in_a_Logic_for_Higher-Order_Concurrency","251307607_Distributive_laws","239537328_Practical_Lock-Freedom","237273058_Skip_Lists_A_Probabilistic_Alternative_to_Balanced_Trees_Skip_lists_are_a_data_structure_that_can_be_used_in_place_of_balanced_trees_Skip_lists_use_probabilistic_balancing_rather_than_strictly_enforce","222621829_Combining_effects_Sum_and_tensor","222460459_Semantics_of_probabilistic_programs","221602562_On_the_Relationship_Between_Concurrent_Separation_Logic_and_Assume-Guarantee_Reasoning","221477308_Checking_Interference_with_Fractional_Permissions","221241292_Just_do_It_Simple_Monadic_Equational_Reasoning","221496189_Concurrent_Abstract_Predicates","221302455_A_Hoare_Logic_for_the_State_Monad","221220052_Skip_Lists_A_Probabilistic_Alternative_to_Balanced_Trees"]}
