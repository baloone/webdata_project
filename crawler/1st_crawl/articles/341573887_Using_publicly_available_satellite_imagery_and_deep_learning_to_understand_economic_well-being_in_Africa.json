{"id":"341573887_Using_publicly_available_satellite_imagery_and_deep_learning_to_understand_economic_well-being_in_Africa","abstract":"Accurate and comprehensive measurements of economic well-being are fundamental inputs into both research and policy, but such measures are unavailable at a local level in many parts of the world. Here we train deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across ~ 20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral satellite imagery. Models can explain 70% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery, and comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task. We demonstrate the utility of satellite-based estimates for research and policy, and demonstrate their scalability by creating a wealth map for Africaâ€™s most populous country.","authors":["Christopher Yeh","Anthony Perez","Anne Driscoll","George Azzari"],"meta":["May 2020Nature Communications 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-16185-w"],"references":["332046995_Mapping_changes_in_housing_in_sub-Saharan_Africa_from_2000_to_2015","330217146_Socioecologically_informed_use_of_remote_sensing_data_to_predict_rural_household_poverty","327762768_Variation_in_Childhood_Diarrheal_Morbidity_and_Mortality_in_Africa_2000-2015","323455835_Mapping_local_variation_in_educational_attainment_across_Africa","323455710_Mapping_child_growth_failure_in_Africa_between_2000_and_2015","321025230_Poverty_Prediction_with_Public_Landsat_7_Satellite_Imagery_and_Machine_Learning","353634379_Poverty_from_Space_Using_High_Resolution_Satellite_Imagery_for_Estimating_Economic_Well-being","334713029_Predicting_Economic_Development_using_Geolocated_Wikipedia_Articles","321160483_Poverty_Mapping_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Trained_on_High_and_Medium_Resolution_Satellite_Images_With_an_Application_in_Mexico","321138205_Can_Human_Development_be_Measured_with_Satellite_Imagery"]}
