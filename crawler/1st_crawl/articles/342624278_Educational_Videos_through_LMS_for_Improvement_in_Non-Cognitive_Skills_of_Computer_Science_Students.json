{"id":"342624278_Educational_Videos_through_LMS_for_Improvement_in_Non-Cognitive_Skills_of_Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"The LMS is an e-learning platform that allows students to familiarize their learning in line with instructional goals. LMS facilitates learners by giving access to learning tools and resources to enrich their learning. While several studies can be spotted on LMSs supporting students' learning and enriching students' cognitive and affective skills, the most common gains of student learning from LMS are measured in terms of students' performance satisfaction, motivation and self-efficacy. There is a call for more research that empirically examines theoretically grounded constructs of learning and motivation in the context of learning with the use of LMS.The primary objective of this paper is to assess the gain of the non-cognitive skills namely Attention and Motivation through Educational videos, Confidence for Communication and Self-learning capability by participating in a course through LMS Moodle. Conducive environment is created as a part of a research project; the assessment is done by a methodically designed questionnaire for each skill. The questionnaires are administered at the completion of the course. The results are analyzed for testing the hypotheses formulated.","authors":["Ramaswamy Mahalakshmi","E. S. M.
