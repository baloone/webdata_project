{"id":"333355065_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Persian_Plagiarism_Detection","abstract":"Plagiarism detection is defined as the automatic identification of reused text materials. General availability of the internet and easy access to textual information enhances the need for automated plagiarism detection. In this regard, different algorithms have been proposed to perform the task of plagiarism detection in text documents. Due to drawbacks and inefficiency of traditional methods and lack of proper algorithms for Persian plagiarism detection, in this paper, we propose a deep learning based method to detect plagiarism. In the proposed method, words are represented as multi-dimensional vectors, and simple aggregation methods are used to combine the word vectors for sentence representation. By comparing representations of source and suspicious sentences, pair sentences with the highest similarity are considered as the candidates for plagiarism. The decision on being plagiarism is performed using a two-level evaluation method. Our method has been used in PAN2016 Persian plagiarism detection contest and results in %90.6 plagdet, %85.8 recall, and % 95.9 precision on the provided data sets","authors":["Erfaneh Gharavi","Hadi Veisi","Kayvan Bijari","Kiarash Zahirnia"],"meta":["May 2019","Project: Text mining"],"references":["300354144_Improving_the_Reproducibility_of_PAN's_Shared_Tasks","291346476_Three_Way_Search_Engine_Queries_with_Multi-feature_Document_Comparison_for_Plagiarism_Detection","286464577_Automatic_external_Persian_plagiarism_detection_using_vector_space_model","284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","277298663_Comparing_Similarity_Measures_for_Original_WSD_Lesk_Algorithm","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","259188320_Plagiarism_Meets_Paraphrasing_Insights_for_the_Next_Generation_in_Automatic_Plagiarism_Detection","246992518_Old_and_new_challenges_in_automatic_plagiarism_detection","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","230897310_Ousting_Ivory_Tower_Research_Towards_a_Web_Framework_for_Providing_Experiments_as_a_Service","228452494_Dynamic_Pooling_and_Unfolding_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Paraphrase_Detection","224370197_Use_of_text_syntactical_structures_in_detection_of_document_duplicates","224095782_Duplicate_Detection_in_Documents_and_WebPages_Using_Improved_Longest_Common_Subsequence_and_Documents_Syntactical_Structures","221620570_Phone_Recognition_with_the_Mean-Covariance_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine","221345058_Learning_Distributed_Representations_by_Mapping_Concepts_and_Relations_into_a_Linear_Space","221251614_Plagiarism_Detection_through_Multilevel_Text_Comparison","221102075_An_Evaluation_Framework_for_Plagiarism_Detection","37992016_Lexical_Chains_and_Sliding_Locality_Windows_in_Content-based_Text_Similarity_Detection","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","312375903_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Models","311065401_Algorithms_and_Corpora_for_Persian_Plagiarism_Detection","285895924_Linguistic_regularities_in_continuous_space_word_representations","262416109_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_and_Documents","260641551_Design_a_Persian_Automated_Plagiarism_Detector_AMZPPD","247662534_Student_cheating_and_plagiarism_in_the_internet_era_A_wake-up_call","245098892_A_synopsis_of_linguistic_theory","237132944_Plagiarism_-_A_Problem_and_How_to_Fight_it","221345848_A_unified_architecture_for_natural_language_processing_Deep_neural_networks_with_multitask_learning","220433251_Methods_for_Identifying_Versioned_and_Plagiarized_Documents","51119064_Composition_in_Distributional_Models_of_Semantics","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets"]}
