{"id":"313845060_A_Random_Matrix_Approach_to_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This article studies the Gram random matrix model $G=\\frac1T\\Sigma^{\\rm T}\\Sigma$, $\\Sigma=\\sigma(WX)$, classically found in random neural networks, where $X=[x_1,\\ldots,x_T]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times T}$ is a (data) matrix of bounded norm, $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ is a matrix of independent zero-mean unit variance entries, and $\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a Lipschitz continuous (activation) function --- $\\sigma(WX)$ being understood entry-wise. We prove that, as $n,p,T$ grow large at the same rate, the resolvent $Q=(G+\\gamma I_T)^{-1}$, for $\\gamma>0$, has a similar behavior as that met in sample covariance matrix models, involving notably the moment $\\Phi=\\frac{T}n\\mathrm{E}[G]$, which provides in passing a deterministic equivalent for the empirical spectral measure of $G$. This result, established by means of concentration of measure arguments, enables the estimation of the asymptotic performance of single-layer random neural networks. This in turn provides practical insights into the underlying mechanisms into play in random neural networks, entailing several unexpected consequences, as well as a fast practical means to tune the network hyperparameters.","authors":["Cosme Louart","Zhenyu Liao","Romain Couillet"],"meta":["February 2017The Annals of Applied Probability 28(2)","DOI:10.1214/17-AAP1328"],"references":["312216269_A_Large_Dimensional_Analysis_of_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machines","342232632_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317723409_The_counterintuitive_mechanism_of_graph-based_semi-supervised_learning_in_the_big_data_regime","314266643_Random_matrix_improved_subspace_clustering","313441169_Extreme_Learning_Machine_for_Regression_and_Multiclass_Classification_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_Part_B_Cybernetics","309532479_Random_features_for_large_scale_kernel_machines","306157314_Extreme_learning_machine_for_regression_and_multiclass_classification","282863443_Kernel_spectral_clustering_of_large_dimensional_data","279517676_An_ELM-based_model_for_affective_analogical_reasoning"]}
