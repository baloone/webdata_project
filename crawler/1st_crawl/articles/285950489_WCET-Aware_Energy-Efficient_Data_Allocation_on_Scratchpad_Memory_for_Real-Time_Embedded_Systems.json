{"id":"285950489_WCET-Aware_Energy-Efficient_Data_Allocation_on_Scratchpad_Memory_for_Real-Time_Embedded_Systems","abstract":"Scratchpad memory (SPM) is a software-managed, small, on-chip form of memory. For real-time embedded systems, worst case execution time (WCET) is more important than average-case performance. We address the problem of allocating program data variables between main memory and SPM to minimize the energy consumption due to data variable accesses, while respecting a given upper bound on a program's WCET. We present an optimal branch-and-bound algorithm; and an efficient heuristic algorithm. Our approach provides a flexible framework for the designer to perform tradeoff analysis between the program WCET and the energy consumption based on application requirements.","authors":["Zhu Wang","Zonghua Gu","Zili Shao"],"meta":["December 2014IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems 23(11):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2379635"],"references":["254006258_WCET-Aware_Data_Selection_and_Allocation_for_Scratchpad_Memory","220094311_Dynamic_Allocation_for_Scratch-Pad_Memory_Using_Compile-Time_Decisions","261059429_MGC_Multiple_graph-coloring_for_non-volatile_memory_based_hybrid_Scratchpad_Memory","260655577_Data_Allocation_Optimization_for_Hybrid_Scratch_Pad_Memory_With_SRAM_and_Nonvolatile_Memory","222814916_Chronos_A_timing_analyzer_for_embedded_software","221338973_Towards_energy_efficient_hybrid_on-chip_Scratch_Pad_Memory_with_non-volatile_memory","221298409_WCET_Centric_Data_Allocation_to_Scratchpad_Memory"]}
