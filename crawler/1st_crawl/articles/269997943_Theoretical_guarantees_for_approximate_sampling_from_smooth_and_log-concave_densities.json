{"id":"269997943_Theoretical_guarantees_for_approximate_sampling_from_smooth_and_log-concave_densities","abstract":"Sampling from various kind of distributions is an issue of paramount\nimportance in statistics since it is often the key ingredient for constructing\nestimators, testing procedures or confidence intervals. In many situations, the\nexact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally\nexpensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling\nstrategies. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no well-developed\ntheory providing meaningful nonasymptotic guarantees for the approximate\nsampling procedures, especially in the high-dimensional problems. This paper\naims at doing the first steps in this direction by considering the problem of\nsampling from a distribution having a smooth and log-concave density defined on\n$\\mathbb R^p$, for some integer $p>0$. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for\nthe error of approximating the true distribution by the one obtained from the\nLangevin Monte Carlo method.","authors":["Arnak Dalalyan"],"meta":["December 2014Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B (Statistical Methodology) 79(3)","DOI:10.1111/rssb.12183","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280221145_Non-asymptotic_convergence_analysis_for_the_Unadjusted_Langevin_Algorithm","274830434_Informative_g_-Priors_for_Logistic_Regression","259367918_A_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Metropolis_Adjusted_Langevin_Algorithm_for_Bayesian_Variable_Selection","252341360_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Theory_and_Methods","237000221_Proximal_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_algorithms","235326019_Estimation_of_spectral_gap_for_elliptic_operators","227197084_Langevin-Type_Models_II_Self-Targeting_Candidates_for_MCMC_Algorithms","221591212_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","50235701_Optimal_Scaling_and_Diffusion_Limits_for_the_Langevin_Algorithm_in_High_Dimensions","45935852_Non-asymptotic_mixing_of_the_MALA_algorithm","38348609_MCMC_convergence_diagnosis_via_multivariate_bounds_on_log-concave_densities","38339862_Log-Sobolev_inequalities_and_sampling_from_log-concave_distributions","2633151_Sampling_From_Log-Concave_Distributions","2353262_Computable_Bounds_for_Geometric_Convergence_Rates_of_Markov_Chains","2118656_Quantitative_Bounds_on_Convergence_of_Time-inhomogeneous_Markov_Chains","280989994_Sparse_regression_learning_by_aggregation_and_Langevin_Monte-Carlo","280790778_Estimation_recursive_de_la_mesure_invariante_d'un_processus_de_diffusion","279552046_Recursive_computation_of_the_invariant_distribution_of_a_diffusion","273002355_Convex_Optimization","265480183_Analysis_and_Geometry_of_Markov_Diffusion_Operators","264960653_A_bridge_between_nonlinear_time-series_models_and_nonlinear_stochastic_dynamic-systems-A_local_linearization_approach","263006590_Log-Concavity_and_Strong_Log-Concavity_a_review","258232298_Convergence_rates_for_MCMC_algorithms_for_a_robust_Bayesian_binary_regression_model","258222850_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","256498632_Langevin_diffusions_and_the_Metropolis-adjusted_Langevin_algorithm","245795097_Convex_Optimization_Cambridge_Univ","244492575_Quantitative_Convergence_Rates_of_Markov_Chains_A_Simple_Account","229100978_Bayesian_Auxiliary_Variable_Models_for_Binary_and_Multinomial_Regression","229058134_Convex_Optimization","227672958_Optimal_scaling_of_discrete_approximations_to_Langevin_diffusions","227657870_Riemann_Manifold_Langevin_and_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo_methods","227425005_Geometric_ergodicity_of_Metropolis_algorithms","226460107_Langevin_Diffusions_and_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","226046683_Langevin-Type_Models_I_Diffusions_with_Given_Stationary_Distributions_and_their_Discretizations","221499039_Fast_Algorithms_for_Logconcave_Functions_Sampling_Rounding_Integration_and_Optimization","221497421_Sparse_Regression_Learning_by_Aggregation_and_Langevin_Monte-Carlo","220617483_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","38373539_Exponential_Convergence_of_Langevin_Distributions_and_Their_Discrete_Approximations","5110883_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_MCMC-based_Estimators_in_Large_Samples","2111878_General_state_space_Markov_chains_and_MCMC_algorithms"]}
