How can students be better prepared to face the actual demands? Can we identify some particular issues that need more attention? How can the linkage between academia and companies be strengthened? Several works were presented, reflecting concerns and sharing experiences: four papers focus on Internship projects; one papers emphasis the development of more conscientious professionals regarding laboratory safety; other called attention regarding modern market demands (necessity for professionals to integrate fields like computer science, information systems and computer engineering); and two papers centered on the importance of motivating young students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.","authors":["Clara Viegas","Maria Marques","Gustavo Ribeiro Alves"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1145/2808580.2808665","Conference: the 3rd International Conference"],"references":["254248998_Project-based_learning_as_a_contributing_factor_to_graduates'_work_readiness","228655175_Engineering_graduates'_perceptions_of_how_well_they_were_prepared_for_work_in_industry","228446643_Problem_Based_Learning_in_Engineering_Design","2628093_The_Future_Of_Engineering_Education_Ii_Teaching_Methods_That_Work","319393897_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_The_classification_of_educational_goals_Handbook_I_cognitive_domain","258148602_Does_it_Matter_Which_Comes_First_in_a_Curriculum_for_Engineering_Students_-_Theory_or_Practice","242403035_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_the_classification_of_educational_goals_handbook_i","240524713_The_difficult_bridge_between_university_and_industry_A_case_study_in_computer_science_teaching","49302995_The_Conditions_of_Learning"]}
