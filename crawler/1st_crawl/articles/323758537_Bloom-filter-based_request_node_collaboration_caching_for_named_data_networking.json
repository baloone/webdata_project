{"id":"323758537_Bloom-filter-based_request_node_collaboration_caching_for_named_data_networking","abstract":"To promote data caching efficiency, caching space utilization, and data content searching speed of the content store (CS) unit in named data networking (NDN) routers, a sum-up Bloom-filter-based request node collaboration caching (BRCC) approach is proposed in this paper. BRCC realizes different forms of caching for different types of data content. It sets the data content life time in accordance with its request frequency. It thereby promotes caching efficiency by caching high-frequent requested data content around the request node. In addition, it enhances the data content matching rate and decreases the searching time by using the sum-up Bloom filter. Simulation results showed that BRCC can efficiently utilize the CS caching space of NDN routers, reduce duplicate data caching, promote the cache hit rate, and increase the data content searching speed.","authors":["Rui Hou","Lang Zhang","Tingting Wu","Tengyue Mao"],"meta":["May 2019Cluster Computing 22(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10586-018-2403-9"],"references":["320482246_Adaptive_Compression_Trie_Based_Bloom_Filter_Request_Filter_for_NDN_Content_Store","326367863_Probabilistic_in-network_caching_for_information-centric_networks","320825783_Information-centric_networking_A_review_on_futuristic_networks","317071155_Effective_Content_Management_Technique_Based_on_Cooperation_Cache_among_Neighboring_Routers_in_Content-Centric_Networking","315846616_On-demand_anchor-based_mobility_support_method_for_named_data_networking","314920368_Towards_controller-aided_multimedia_dissemination_in_Named_Data_Networking","313586095_Performance_evaluation_of_caching_policies_in_NDN_-_an_ICN_architecture","312963386_A_Content_Store-Based_Module_for_Congestion_Control_Algorithms_of_Named_Data_Networking","311490159_Cache_Sharing_Using_a_Bloom_Filter_in_Named_Data_Networking","308849717_A_survey_on_named_data_networking","305744487_A_Survey_on_Future_Internet_Security_Architectures","304415851_A_Hybrid_ICN_Cache_Coordination_Scheme_Based_on_Role_Division_between_Cache_Nodes","304415607_Cache-Aware_Named-Data_Forwarding_in_Internet_of_Things","302919729_A_Survey_of_Caching_Policies_and_Forwarding_Mechanisms_in_Information-Centric_Networking","302479440_Trie_compact_representation_using_double-array_structures_with_string_labels"]}
