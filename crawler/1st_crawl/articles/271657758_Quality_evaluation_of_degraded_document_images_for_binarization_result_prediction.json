{"id":"271657758_Quality_evaluation_of_degraded_document_images_for_binarization_result_prediction","abstract":"This article proposes an approach to predict the result of binarization algorithms on a given document image according to its state of degradation. Indeed, historical documents suffer from different types of degradation which result in binarization errors. We intend to characterize the degradation of a document image by using different features based on the intensity, quantity and location of the degradation. These features allow us to build prediction models of binarization algorithms that are very accurate according to \\(R^2\\) values and p values. The prediction models are used to select the best binarization algorithm for a given document image. Obviously, this image-by-image strategy improves the binarization of the entire dataset.","authors":["Vincent Rabeux","Nicholas Journet","Anne Vialard","Jean-Philippe Domenger"],"meta":["June 2013International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR) 17(2):125-137","DOI:10.1007/s10032-013-0211-6"],"references":["261311274_A_learning_framework_for_degraded_document_image_binarization_using_Markov_Random_Field","305437251_An_Introduction_to_Digital_Image_Processing","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","268757906_Selection_of_Variables_in_Multiple_Regression_Part_II_Chosen_Procedures_Computations_and_Examples","268499834_Selection_of_Variables_in_Multiple_Regression_Part_I_A_Review_and_Evaluation","267476046_Threshold_selection_using_Renyi's_entropy","264585101_On_threshold_selection_using_clustering_criteria","258813928_Goal-oriented_evaluation_of_binarization_algorithms_for_historical_document_images","257468582_Utilization_of_Information_Measure_as_a_Means_of_Image_Thresholding","257014775_An_iterative_algorithm_for_minimum_cross_entropy_thresholding"]}
