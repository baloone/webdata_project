{"id":"350148227_User_experience_evaluation_of_academic_progress_information_systems_using_retrospective_think_aloud_and_user_experience_questionnaire","abstract":"SIsKA-NG is the result of advanced development of the thesis management information system at the Computer Science Study Program, Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha. Usability evaluation needs to validate development results based on user requirements. This research aimed to identify problems and user satisfaction when using SIsKA-NG with student access. This research used Retrospective Think Aloud in specifying difficulties or user suggestions and User Experience Questionnaires to obtain user satisfaction scores. An evaluation was carried out on 20 respondents who were selected using simple random sampling from 139 active SIsKA-NG users. Retrospective Think Aloud produced 4 recommendations for improvement of SIsKA-NG. User satisfaction analysis showed that all aspects of the user experience were in the excellent category. The average score for each aspect was as follows: attractiveness aspect was 2,23; perspicuity aspect was 2,30; efficiency aspect was 2,49; dependability aspect was 2,55; stimulation aspect was 2,30; and novelty aspect was 2,35. Future research will focus on the evaluation of SIsKA-NG in all other study programs at Postgraduate program in Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha.","authors":["I M A O Gunawan","Gede Indrawan","Sariyasa Sariyasa"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1810(1):012015","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1810/1/012015"],"references":["341937982_User_experience_evaluation_of_e-report_application_using_cognitive_walkthrough_cw_heuristic_evaluation_he_and_user_experience_questionnaire_ueq","334857825_The_Evaluation_of_Web_Based_Academic_Progress_Information_System_Using_Heuristic_Evaluation_and_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ","334607536_Usability_Testing_pada_Aplikasi_POTWIS","331374501_PENGUKURAN_USER_EXPERIENCE_DENGAN_PENDEKATAN_USABILITY_STUDI_KASUS_WEBSITE_PARIWISATA_DI_ASIA_TENGGARA","330735186_Developing_a_UX_KPI_based_on_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire","319949282_SIsKA_Mobile_Based_Academic_Progress_Information_System","311982961_Construction_of_a_Benchmark_for_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ","354532439_ANALISIS_KEBERMANFAATAN_WEBSITE_SEKOLAH_TINGGI_PARIWISATA_STIPAR_TRIATMA_JAYA_MENGGUNAKAN_METODE_USABILITY_TESTING","343228066_PERBANDINGAN_METODE_EVALUASI_USABILITY_STUDI_KASUS_PENGGUNAAN_PERANGKAT_SMARTPHONE","340444804_The_Usability_Evaluation_of_Academic_Progress_Information_System_SIsKA-NG"]}
