{"id":"337110100_On_the_Families_of_Graphs_With_Unbounded_Metric_Dimension","abstract":"A family G of connected graphs is a family with unbounded metric dimension if dim(G) is not constant and depends on the order of graph. In this paper, we compute the metric dimension of the splitting graphs S(Pn) and S(Cn) of a path and cycle. We prove that the metric dimension of these graphs varies and depends on the number of vertices of the graph.","authors":["Heng Pan","Murtaza Ali","Gohar Ali","M.T.
