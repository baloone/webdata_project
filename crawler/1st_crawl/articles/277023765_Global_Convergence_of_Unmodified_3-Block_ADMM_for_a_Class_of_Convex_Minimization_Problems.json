{"id":"277023765_Global_Convergence_of_Unmodified_3-Block_ADMM_for_a_Class_of_Convex_Minimization_Problems","abstract":"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been successfully\napplied to solve structured convex optimization problems due to its superior\npractical performance. The convergence properties of the 2-block ADMM have been\nstudied extensively in the literature. Specifically, it has been proven that\nthe 2-block ADMM globally converges for any penalty parameter $\\gamma>0$. In\nthis sense, the 2-block ADMM allows the parameter to be free, i.e., there is no\nneed to restrict the value for the parameter when implementing this algorithm\nin order to ensure convergence. However, for the 3-block ADMM, Chen et al.\nrecently constructed a counter-example showing that it can diverge if no\nfurther condition is imposed. The existing results on studying further\nsufficient conditions on guaranteeing the convergence of the 3-block ADMM\nusually require $\\gamma$ to be smaller than a certain bound, which is usually\neither difficult to compute or too small to make it a practical algorithm. In\nthis paper, we show that the 3-block ADMM still globally converges with any\npenalty parameter $\\gamma>0$ when applied to solve a class of commonly\nencountered problems to be called regularized least squares decomposition\n(RLSD) in this paper, which covers many important applications in practice.","authors":["Tianyi Lin","Shiqian Ma","Shuzhong Zhang"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Scientific Computing 76(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-017-0612-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["310517600_Parallel_Multi-Block_ADMM_with_o1_k_Convergence","305692934_On_the_convergence_of_the_direct_extension_of_ADMM_for_three-block_separable_convex_minimization_models_with_one_strongly_convex_function","284160173_On_Full_Jacobian_Decomposition_of_the_Augmented_Lagrangian_Method_for_Separable_Convex_Programming","313454247_Convergence_Rate_Analysis_for_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers_with_a_Substitution_Procedure_for_Separable_Convex_Programming","304922056_The_augmented_lagrange_multiplier_method_for_exact_recovery_of_corrupted_low-rank_matrices_Technical_Report","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","304533564_Applications_of_the_method_of_multipliers_to_variational_inequalities","303042850_On_the_global_linear_convergence_of_alternating_direction_methods","285677677_Augmented_Lagrangian_Methods_Applications_to_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Boundary-Value_Problems","285344468_SpaRCS_Recovering_low-rank_and_sparse_matrices_from_compressive_measurements","274967436_Iteration_Complexity_Analysis_of_Multi-Block_ADMM_for_a_Family_of_Convex_Minimization_without_Strong_Convexity","274645139_A_Three-Operator_Splitting_Scheme_and_its_Optimization_Applications","274012212_On_the_Expected_Convergence_of_Randomly_Permuted_ADMM","273952060_SPARCoC_A_New_Framework_for_Molecular_Pattern_Discovery_and_Cancer_Gene_Identification","274141350_Median_filtering-based_methods_for_static_background_extraction_from_surveillance_video"]}
