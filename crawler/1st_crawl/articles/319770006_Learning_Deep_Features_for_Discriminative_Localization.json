{"id":"319770006_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Discriminative_Localization","abstract":"In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13], and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network to have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on image-level labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that can be applied to a variety of tasks. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014, which is remarkably close to the 34.2% top-5 error achieved by a fully supervised CNN approach. We demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them","authors":["Bolei Zhou","Aditya Khosla","Ã€gata Lapedriza","Aude Oliva"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2016.319","Conference: CVPR"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","279839496_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Scene_Recognition_using_Places_Database","273158036_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Localization_with_Multi-Fold_Multiple_Instance_Learning","271659916_Local_Alignments_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization","269935290_Object_detectors_emerge_in_Deep_Scene_CNNs","268525469_ConceptLearner_Discovering_Visual_Concepts_from_Weakly_Labeled_Image_Collections","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","257052073_Deformable_Part_Descriptors_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition_and_Attribute_Prediction","221364644_Recognizing_Indoor_Scenes","221110077_End-to-end_scene_text_recognition","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","30766223_Caltech-256_Object_Category_Dataset","4301709_What_where_and_who_Classifying_events_by_scene_and_object_recognition","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770362_Part-based_R-CNNs_for_Fine-grained_Category_Detection","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","308850633_From_image-level_to_pixel-level_labeling_with_Convolutional_Networks","308161116_Is_object_localization_for_free_-_Weakly-supervised_learning_with_convolutional_neural_networks","307822569_Understanding_deep_image_representations_by_inverting_them","303563713_Self-taught_object_localization_with_deep_networks","286301662_Simple_Baseline_for_Visual_Question_Answering","281886334_Learning_and_Transferring_Mid-Level_Image_Representations_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","278048846_Inverting_Convolutional_Networks_with_Convolutional_Networks","269040983_Understanding_Deep_Image_Representations_by_Inverting_Them","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","261306213_SUN_attribute_database_Discovering_annotating_and_recognizing_scene_attributes","259399927_Deep_Inside_Convolutional_Networks_Visualising_Image_Classification_Models_and_Saliency_Maps","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","222817667_Learning_Generative_Visual_Models_from_Few_Training_Examples_An_Incremental_Bayesian_Approach_Tested_on_101_Object_Categories","221362554_SUN_database_Large-scale_scene_recognition_from_abbey_to_zoo","221111619_Human_action_recognition_by_learning_bases_of_action_attributes_and_parts","4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories"]}
