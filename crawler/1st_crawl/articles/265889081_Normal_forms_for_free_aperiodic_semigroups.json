{"id":"265889081_Normal_forms_for_free_aperiodic_semigroups","abstract":"The implicit operation ω is the unary operation which sends each element of a finite semigroup to the unique idempotent contained in the subsemigroup it generates. Using ω there is a well-defined algebra which is known as the free aperiodic semigroup. In this article we introduce a specific and rather elementary list of pseudoidentitites, we show that for each n, the n-generated free aperiodic semigroup is defined by this list of pseudoidentities, and then we use this identification to show that it has a decidable word problem. In the language of implicit operations, this shows that the pseudovariety of finite aperiodic semigroups is κ-recursive. This completes a crucial step towards showing that the Krohn-Rhodes complexity of every finite semigroup is decidable.","authors":["Jon Mccammond"],"meta":["October 2001International Journal of Algebra and Computation 11(5)","DOI:10.1142/S0218196701000693"],"references":["255712223_A_Course_in_Universal_Algebra","2311773_On_the_Decidability_of_Iterated_Semidirect_Products_With_Applications_to_Complexity","268642070_Implicit_operations_on_pseudo-varieties_An_introduction","263866944_THE_WORD_PROBLEM_FOR_THE_RELATIVELY_FREE_SEMIGROUP_SATISFYING_TmTmn_WITH_m3","263791389_The_solution_to_the_word_problem_for_the_relatively_free_semigroups_satisfying_Ta_Tab_with_a_6","220151601_On_Noncounting_Regular_Classes","2851306_Profinite_Semigroups_Mal'cev_Products_and_Identities"]}
