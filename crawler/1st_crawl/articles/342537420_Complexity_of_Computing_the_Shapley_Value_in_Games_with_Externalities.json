{"id":"342537420_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Shapley_Value_in_Games_with_Externalities","abstract":"We study the complexity of computing the Shapley value in games with externalities. We focus on two representations based on marginal contribution nets (embedded MC-nets and weighted MC-nets) and five extensions of the Shapley value to games with externalities. Our results show that while weighted MC-nets are more concise than embedded MC-nets, they have slightly worse computational properties when it comes to computing the Shapley value: two out of five extensions can be computed in polynomial time for embedded MC-nets and only one for weighted MC-nets.","authors":["Oskar Skibski"],"meta":["April 2020Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 34(02):2244-2251","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v34i02.5601"],"references":["337853838_Partition_decision_trees_representation_for_efficient_computation_of_the_Shapley_value_extended_to_games_with_externalities","313363375_Computational_Aspects_of_Extending_the_Shapley_Value_to_Coalitional_Games_with_Externalities","313363209_A_Logic-Based_Representation_for_Coalitional_Games_with_Externalities","309017780_The_non-emptiness_of_the_core_of_a_partition_function_form_game","262277099_Computational_Analysis_of_Connectivity_Games_with_Applications_to_the_Investigation_of_Terrorist_Networks","261665092_The_Shapley_value_for_partition_function_form_games","228285744_Endogenous_Formation_of_Economic_Coalitions_A_Survey_on_the_Partition_Function_Approach","225120974_An_axiomatic_characterization_of_a_value_for_games_in_partition_function_form","220788909_Power_Indices_in_Spanning_Connectivity_Games","316782270_The_Stochastic_Shapley_Value_for_Coalitional_Games_with_Externalities","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","231831212_On_the_computational_complexity_of_the_Jones_and_Tutte_polynomials","225921391_Value_of_Games_in_Partition_Function_Form","222825640_Sharing_the_Surplus_An_Extension_of_the_Shapley_Value_for_Environments_with_Externalities","222401496_The_extended_and_generalized_Shapley_value_Simultaneous_consideration_of_coalitional_externalities_and_coalitional_structure","221471339_Multiagent_Resource_Allocation_in_the_Presence_of_Externalities","221445062_Marginal_contribution_nets_A_compact_representation_scheme_for_coalitional_games","220618207_The_Complexity_of_Enumeration_and_Reliability_Problems","39997641_Coalition_Structure_Generation_in_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Positive_and_Negative_Externalities","34552374_Bargaining_coalition_formation_and_value","24058357_A_Set_of_Axioms_for_a_Value_for_Partition_Function_Games","23525672_Marginal_Contributions_and_Externalities_in_the_Value","5202061_Graphs_and_Cooperation_in_Games"]}
