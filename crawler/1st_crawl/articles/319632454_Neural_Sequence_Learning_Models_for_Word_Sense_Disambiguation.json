{"id":"319632454_Neural_Sequence_Learning_Models_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","abstract":"Word Sense Disambiguation models exist in many flavors. Even though supervised ones tend to perform best in terms of accuracy, they often lose ground to more flexible knowledge-based solutions, which do not require training by a word expert for every disambiguation target. To bridge this gap we adopt a different perspective and rely on sequence learning to frame the disambiguation problem: we propose and study in depth a series of end-to-end neural architectures directly tailored to the task, from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory to encoder-decoder models. Our extensive evaluation over standard benchmarks and in multiple languages shows that sequence learning enables more versatile all-words models that consistently lead to state-of-the-art results, even against word experts with engineered features.","authors":["Alessandro Raganato","Claudio Delli Bovi","Roberto Navigli"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.18653/v1/D17-1120","Conference: 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)At: Copenhagen, Denmark","Project: Harnessing Sense-Level Information for Semantically Augmented Knowledge Extraction"],"references":["318738966_ShotgunWSD_An_unsupervised_algorithm_for_global_word_sense_disambiguation_inspired_by_DNA_sequencing","316040022_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_A_Unified_Evaluation_Framework_and_Empirical_Comparison","314092103_Identifying_beneficial_task_relations_for_multi-task_learning_in_deep_neural_networks","308457761_Semantic_Tagging_with_Deep_Residual_Networks","322587848_Train-O-Matic_Large-Scale_Supervised_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_in_Multiple_Languages_without_Manual_Training_Data","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","318741088_When_is_multitask_learning_effective_Semantic_sequence_prediction_under_varying_data_conditions","318741074_Identifying_beneficial_task_relations_for_multi-task_learning_in_deep_neural_networks","317300281_Semantic_Specialisation_of_Distributional_Word_Vector_Spaces_using_Monolingual_and_Cross-Lingual_Constraints"]}
