{"id":"327119621_Internet_of_Things_and_its_applications_in_libraries_a_literature_review","abstract":"Purpose\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that draws academia and industry attention in the past few years. The purpose of this paper is to review the current research on IoT in library operation, and report the future trends and research challenges as well.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nTo conduct this research, the literature on IoT and its application in libraries was retrieved from major databases such as Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and Inspec for the period between 2010 and 2018.\n\nFindings\n\nThis study identifies IoT potential impact on libraries, and excavates some valuable literature on IoT and its application in libraries from managerial perspective, especially focuses on library service innovation in IoT era.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThe IoT application in libraries is a new subject. This study provides an overview of IoT application in libraries. The findings of this study contribute to the research on IoT and its role in library management.","authors":["Xueling Liang"],"meta":["August 2018Library Hi Tech 38(1)","DOI:10.1108/LHT-01-2018-0014"],"references":["315845989_Energy_system_retrofit_in_a_public_services_building","315472746_Big_Data_for_Industry_40_A_Conceptual_Framework","313189612_Towards_Cyberphysical_Digital_Libraries_Integrating_IoT_Smart_Objects_into_Digital_Libraries","301940953_Recent_advances_delivered_by_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_and_Internet_of_Things_for_Big_Data_applications_a_survey_Advances_delivered_by_MCC_and_IoT_for_Big_Data_applications","295246925_The_Internet_of_Things_and_its_impact_on_the_library","280497774_The_Internet_of_Things_What_It_Is_and_What_It_Means_for_Libraries","273316307_The_Internet_of_Things_and_Convenience","272475908_Semantic_Web_Ubiquitous_Computing_or_Internet_of_Things_-_A_Macro-Analysis_of_Scholarly_Publications","271921561_The_Internet_of_Things-A_survey_of_topics_and_trends","271658599_The_internet_of_things_A_survey","270742269_Internet_of_Things_in_Industries_A_Survey","345733733_Design_of_Noise_Information_Storage_System_Using_IoT_Devices","323420199_Real-Time_Force_Monitoring_of_Smart_Grippers_for_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Applications","323283145_5G_Internet_of_Things_A_survey","322248114_A_Security_Requirements_Library_for_the_Development_of_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Applications","320678871_Promoting_innovation_and_application_of_internet_of_things_in_academic_and_research_information_organizations","319197547_Predicting_the_Future_Library_Technologies_to_Keep_in_Mind","317639519_Resource_optimization_in_fog_enabled_IoT_deployments","315540309_The_innovation_of_the_internet_a_semantic_network_analysis_of_the_Internet_of_Things","315446911_Library_technology_in_the_next_20_years","313806871_IoT_QoS_in_the_Digital_Library_RFID_Based_LIS","313461142_An_Indoor_Multi-tag_Cooperative_Localization_Algorithm_Based_on_NMDS_for_RFID","311621660_Interface_diversification_in_IoT_operating_systems","310809573_Design_of_Internet_of_Things_System_for_Library_Materials_Management_using_UHF_RFID","309499216_Design_and_Implementation_of_Library_Books_Search_and_Management_System_Using_RFID_Technology","308134874_What's_trending_in_libraries_from_the_internet_cybersphere_-_bookless_libraries_-_02_-_2016","306009430_Traversing_knowledge_networks_an_algorithmic_historiography_of_extant_literature_on_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT","303883394_Internet_of_Things_-_potential_for_libraries","301267443_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Library_Management_System_Based_on_RFID","300626810_Digital_library_network_based_on_the_internet_of_things","300615724_Research_and_Application_of_Internet_of_Things_in_Intelligent_Library","300570096_Designing_and_Implementation_of_University_Library_Automatic_Management_System_Based_on_the_Internet_of_Things","299593087_Proving_ground_for_social_network_analysis_in_the_emerging_research_area_Internet_of_Things_IoT","286600281_Design_and_Development_of_a_Mobile_Library_APP_System","286401419_Exploring_User_Engagement_Strategies_and_Their_Impacts_with_Social_Media_Mining_The_Case_of_Public_Libraries","283894920_Internet_of_Things_Convenience_vs_privacy_and_secrecy","282427811_Imagining_Library_40_Creating_a_Model_for_Future_Libraries","281580304_Business_models_for_the_Internet_of_Things","281391148_Through_the_looking_glass_Thinking_through_the_internet_of_things","278179904_Build_Intelligent_Library_by_Using_Technology_of_the_Internet_of_Things","277931041_Library_as_knowledge_ecosystem","275373213_Putting_things_to_work_Social_and_policy_challenges_for_the_Internet_of_things","275317105_Ad_fontes_Books_on_shelves","272103485_Exploration_and_Construction_of_Smart_Library_Based_on_RFID_Technology","272063068_The_Internet_of_Things_Technology_Application_and_the_Intelligent_Library","272044159_Design_of_Library_Lighting_Energy_Saving_System_Based_on_Internet_of_Things","270594092_Micro-location_for_Internet_of_Things_equipped_Smart_Buildings","269291844_The_Research_and_Construction_of_Wisdom_Campus_Based_on_the_Internet_of_Things","261454374_A_personal_item_positioning_system_based_on_RFID_technology","261355074_An_Internet_based_RFID_library_management_system","261334004_End-to-end_Security_for_Sleepy_Smart_Object_Networks","238324864_Service_innovation_in_academic_libraries_Is_there_a_place_for_the_customers","233987048_The_Social_Internet_of_Things_SIoT_-_When_social_networks_meet_the_Internet_of_Things_Concept_architecture_and_network_characterization","252054728_Research_and_design_of_study_room_management_system_in_university_library_based_on_Internet_of_Things","235642082_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Applications_and_Research_Challenges"]}
