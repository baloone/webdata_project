{"id":"320931527_Explicit_Bias_Toward_High-Income-Country_Research_A_Randomized_Blinded_Crossover_Experiment_Of_English_Clinicians","abstract":"Unconscious bias may interfere with the interpretation of\nresearch from some settings, particularly from lower-income countries.\nMost studies of this phenomenon have relied on indirect outcomes such\nas article citation counts and publication rates; few have addressed or\nproven the effect of unconscious bias in evidence interpretation. In this\nrandomized, blinded crossover experiment in a sample of 347 English\nclinicians, we demonstrate that changing the source of a research\nabstract from a low- to a high-income country significantly improves how\nit is viewed, all else being equal. Using fixed-effects models, we measured\ndifferences in ratings for strength of evidence, relevance, and likelihood\nof referral to a peer. Having a high-income country source had a\nsignificant overall impact on respondentsâ€™ ratings of relevance and\nrecommendation to a peer. Unconscious bias can have far-reaching\nimplications for the diffusion of knowledge and innovations from\nlow-income countries.","authors":["Matthew J Harris","joachim marti","Hilary Watt","Yasser Ahmad Bhatti"],"meta":["November 2017Health Affairs 36(11)","DOI:10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0773","Project: Reverse and Frugal Innovation"],"references":["316746586_Reverse_Innovation_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","316230417_Do_International_Health_Partnerships_contribute_to_reverse_innovation_A_mixed_methods_study_of_THET-supported_partnerships_in_the_UK","304956419_Make_peer_review_scientific","303905540_Impact_of_interventions_to_improve_the_quality_of_peer_review_of_biomedical_journals_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","288828221_Does_a_research_article's_country_of_origin_affect_perception_of_its_quality_and_relevance_A_national_trial_of_US_public_health_researchers","284167774_They_hear_'Africa'_and_they_think_that_there_can't_be_any_good_services","306173475_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","299431454_Looking_in_the_wrong_places_why_traditional_solutions_to_the_diffusion_of_innovation_will_not_work_Table_1","299260261_Lay_health_worker_intervention_with_choice_of_DOT_superior_to_standard_TB_care_for_farm_dwellers_in_South_Africa_a_cluster_randomised_control_trial_vol_9_pg_673_2005","298852493_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science"]}
