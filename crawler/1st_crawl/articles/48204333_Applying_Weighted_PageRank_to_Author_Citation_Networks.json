{"id":"48204333_Applying_Weighted_PageRank_to_Author_Citation_Networks","abstract":"This paper aims to identify whether different weighted PageRank algorithms\ncan be applied to author citation networks to measure the popularity and\nprestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information Retrieval (IR)\nwas selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of\nScience (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted\nvectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that\nboth popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted\nPageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect\nrelationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners\nwithin the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.","authors":["Ying Ding"],"meta":["February 2011Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 62(2)","DOI:10.1002/asi.21452","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301233136_Diffusion_of_scientific_credits_and_the_ranking_of_scientists","260352810_Finding_Scientific_Gems_with_Google","257688184_The_R-and_AR-indices_Complementing_the_H-index","239458357_Citation_influence_for_journal_aggregates_of_scientific_publications_Theory","228108125_Journal_Status","227512514_Using_the_h-index_to_rank_influential_information_scientistss_Brief_Communication","225164395_Using_Hyperlink_Features_to_Personalize_Web_Search","222799230_Citation_influence_for_journal_aggregates_of_scientific_publications_Theory_with_application_to_the_literature_of_physics","220364370_Generalized_Hirsch_h-index_for_disclosing_latent_facts_in_citation_networks","47739488_An_Item_Selection_Procedure_to_Maximise_Scale_Reliability_and_Validity","32116106_Results_from_a_Web_Impact_Factor_crawler","24269448_Citation_graph_weighted_impact_factors_and_performance_indices","23439077_Promise_and_Pitfalls_of_Extending_Google's_PageRank_Algorithm_to_Citation_Networks","5444851_Comparison_of_SCImago_journal_rank_indicator_with_journal_impact_factor","2947319_On_the_Temporal_Dimension_of_Search","2174152_Optimal_ranking_in_networks_with_community_structure","1946763_How_Popular_Is_Your_Paper_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Citation_Distribution","243783369_A_tale_of_two_Web_spaces_Comparing_sites_using_Web_Impact_Factors","242916206_Advantages_and_limitations_in_the_use_of_impact_factor_measures_for_the_assessment_of_research_performance","225265618_Assessing_the_quality_of_scholarly_journals_in_linguistics_An_alternative_to_citation-based_Journal_Impact_Factors","222695366_Co-Authorship_Networks_in_the_Digital_Library_Research_Community","222665044_Popular_andor_Prestigious_Measures_of_Scholarly_Esteem","222418255_The_difference_between_popularity_and_prestige_in_the_sciences_and_in_the_social_sciences_A_bibliometric_analysis","222298156_Finding_scientific_gems_with_Google's_PageRank_algorithm","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220432716_ISI's_Impact_Factor_as_Misnomer_A_Proposed_New_Measure_to_Assess_Journal_Impact","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","30868212_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","12750080_Journal_Impact_Factor_A_Brief_Review","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output","4179931_Information_Domain_Modeling_for_adaptive_Web_systems"]}
