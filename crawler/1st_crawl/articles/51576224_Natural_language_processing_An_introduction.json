{"id":"51576224_Natural_language_processing_An_introduction","abstract":"Objectives To provide an overview and tutorial of natural language processing (NLP) and modern NLP-system design.\nTarget audience This tutorial targets the medical informatics generalist who has limited acquaintance with the principles behind NLP and/or limited knowledge of the current state of the art.\nScope We describe the historical evolution of NLP, and summarize common NLP sub-problems in this extensive field. We then provide a synopsis of selected highlights of medical NLP efforts. After providing a brief description of common machine-learning approaches that are being used for diverse NLP sub-problems, we discuss how modern NLP architectures are designed, with a summary of the Apache Foundation's Unstructured Information Management Architecture. We finally consider possible future directions for NLP, and reflect on the possible impact of IBM Watson on the medical field.","authors":["Prakash M Nadkarni","Lucila Ohno-Machado","Wendy Chapman"],"meta":["September 2011Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 18(5):544-51","DOI:10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000464","SourcePubMed"],"references":["341690965_Syntactic_Structures","319482072_Support_vector_machines","318494277_Mastering_Regular_Expressions","307962645_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","303969126_The_Convergence_of_Mildly_Context-Sensitive_Grammar_Formalisms","300938525_Natural_language_processing","280113549_Speech_and_Language_Processing","276935841_Introduction_to_Information_Retrieval","267674695_Programming_in_Prolog_Using_the_ISO_standard_5th_ed","266440454_Natural_Language_Processing_With_Prolog_in_the_IBM_Watson_System"]}
