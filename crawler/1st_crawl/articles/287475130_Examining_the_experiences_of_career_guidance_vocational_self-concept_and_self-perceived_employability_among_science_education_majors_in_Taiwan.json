{"id":"287475130_Examining_the_experiences_of_career_guidance_vocational_self-concept_and_self-perceived_employability_among_science_education_majors_in_Taiwan","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the science education majors' experiences of career guidance, vocational self-concept, and self-perceived employability, as well as the relationships among these variables in the Taiwanese context based on the developmental-contextual model of career development. Data were collected from a questionnaire survey of 614 science education majors in the selected Taiwanese universities. It was found that the science education majors' experiences of career guidance directly and indirectly influenced their self-perceived employability vis-Ã -vis the effect on their vocational self-concept. The findings suggest that the science education departments of universities in Taiwan may provide sufficient and appropriate career guidance and vocational information for science education majors to promote their vocational selfconcept and employability.","authors":["Ya-Ling Wu","Yu-Lin Tsai","Cheng-Wu Chen"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of Baltic Science Education 13(2):182-190","DOI:10.33225/jbse/14.13.182"],"references":["281274059_The_moderator-mediator_variable_distinction_in_social_psychological_research_Conceptual_strategic_and_statistical_considerations","222993709_Teenage_Aspirations_for_Future_Careers_and_Occupational_Outcomes","19356291_The_Moderator-Mediator_Variable_Distinction_in_Social_Psychological_Research","354181731_The_Nature_of_Career_Advice_Provided_to_Undergraduate_Allied_Health_Sciences_Students_at_the_University_of_South_Australia","308059468_Occupational_aspirations_Constructs_meanings_and_application","289317802_Understanding_the_Educational_Aspirations_of_Taiwanese_Aboriginal_Adolescents_Based_on_the_Developmental-Contextual_Model_of_Career_Development","288787744_Examining_the_learning_experiences_of_science_training_among_Taiwanese_Aboriginal_adolescents","284038036_Career_choice_and_development_Applying_contemporary_theories_to_practice_1996_The_life-span_life-space_approach_to_careers","262174343_The_Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment_2006","257788612_Examining_the_occupational_aspirations_of_Taiwanese_Aboriginal_adolescents_based_on_the_developmental-contextual_model_of_career_development","247721432_Vocational_Preferences_of_Early_AdolescentsTheir_Development_in_Social_Context","247411007_Natureuture_reconceptualized_in_developmental_perspective_A_bioecological_model","237937986_Career_Development_A_Lifespan_Perspective_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section","232977459_Defining_and_Measuring_Employability","227914144_What_do_teachers_need_to_know_about_teaching_A_critical_examination_of_the_occupational_knowledge_of_teachers","223651779_Occupational_knowledge_and_career_development_in_adolescence","41145642_Employability_and_higher_education_Contextualising_female_students'_workplace_experiences_to_enhance_understanding_of_employability_development","15213949_Nature-nurture_reconceptualized_A_bioecological_model"]}
