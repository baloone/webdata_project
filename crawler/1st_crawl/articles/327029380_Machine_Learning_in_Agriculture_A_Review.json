{"id":"327029380_Machine_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Review","abstract":"Machine learning has emerged with big data technologies and high-performance computing to create new opportunities for data intensive science in the multi-disciplinary agri-technologies domain. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies. By applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems are evolving into real time artificial intelligence enabled programs that provide rich recommendations and insights for farmer decision support and action.","authors":["Konstantinos G Liakos","Patrizia Busato","Dimitrios Moshou","Simon Pearson"],"meta":["August 2018Sensors 18(8):2674","DOI:10.3390/s18082674"],"references":["325502063_Towards_on-farm_pig_face_recognition_using_convolutional_neural_networks","322694290_Recent_applications_of_multivariate_data_analysis_methods_in_the_authentication_of_rice_and_the_most_analyzed_parameters_A_review","321675211_Automated_tracking_to_measure_behavioural_changes_in_pigs_for_health_and_welfare_monitoring","318584349_Prolongation_of_SMAP_to_Spatio-temporally_Seamless_Coverage_of_Continental_US_Using_a_Deep_Learning_Neural_Network","317526571_Radiomic_Machine-Learning_Classifiers_for_Prognostic_Biomarkers_of_Advanced_Nasopharyngeal_Carcinoma","342232632_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Theory_and_Applications","325560127_Italian_tomato-based_products_authentication_by_multi-element_approach_A_mineral_elements_database_to_distinguish_the_domestic_provenance","323491692_Near_infrared_computer_vision_and_neuro-fuzzy_model-based_feeding_decision_system_for_fish_in_aquaculture","322941653_Deep_learning_models_for_plant_disease_detection_and_diagnosis","317510333_Controlled_comparison_of_machine_vision_algorithms_for_Rumex_and_Urtica_detection_in_grassland"]}
