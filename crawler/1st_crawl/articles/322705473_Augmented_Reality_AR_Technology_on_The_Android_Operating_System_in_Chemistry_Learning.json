{"id":"322705473_Augmented_Reality_AR_Technology_on_The_Android_Operating_System_in_Chemistry_Learning","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) is considered one of the most sophisticated technologies in virtual reality research and effective as a learning medium especially in chemistry. This study was aimed to describe the stages of AR manufacture technology-based learning media on the molecular geometry. The Research and Development had produced products in the form of AR technology-based learning media on the concept of molecular geometry. The stages of the research were carried out by design development and making the application on Android operating system and analyzing the results of a limited trial. This study shows that the manufacture of AR-based learning media on this android system has the potential to be applied to the learning of chemistry especially on molecular geometry subject.","authors":["Ferli Septi Irwansyah","Y M Yusuf","Ida Farida Ch","Muhammad Ali Ramdhani"],"meta":["January 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 288(1):012068","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/288/1/012068","Projects: ICT-based learning mediaMultiple Representation in Chemistry Education"],"references":["272666435_The_Augmented_Reality_Application_of_Multimedia_Technology_in_Aquatic_Organisms_Instruction","269916239_Graphics_Audio-visuals_and_Interaction_GAI_based_Handheld_Augmented_Reality_System","263229544_Augmented_reality_in_Education_-_Cases_places_and_potentials","233137389_Smartphones_Smart_Objects_and_Augmented_Reality","220530311_An_augmented_reality_interface_for_visualizing_and_interacting_with_virtual_content","288725696_Establishment_and_usability_evaluation_of_an_interactive_AR_learning_system_on_conservation_of_fish","287322919_Augmented_reality_and_ubiquity_in_education","255746259_Research_into_practice_Visualisation_of_the_molecular_world_using_animations","222533794_The_Promise_of_Multimedia_Learning_Using_the_Same_Instructional_Design_Methods_across_Different_Media"]}
