{"id":"30508458_Portable_Graph_Layout_and_Editing","abstract":"The Graph Layout Toolkit and the Graph Editor Toolkit are portable, flexible toolkits for graph layout and graph editing systems. The Graph Layout Toolkit contains four highly customizable layout algorithms, and supports hierarchical graphs. The Graph Editor Toolkit is a tightly coupled interactive front end to the Graph Layout Toolkit.","authors":["Brendan Madden","Patrick Madden","Steve Powers","Michael Himsolt"],"meta":["September 1995Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1027","DOI:10.1007/BFb0021822"],"references":["223040356_Algorithms_for_Drawing_Graphs_An_Annotated_Bibliography","30508374_Improved_Algorithms_and_Bounds_for_Orthogonal_Drawings","313604951_A_better_heuristic_for_orthogonal_graph_drawings","242540768_Methods_for_visual_understanding_of_heirarchical_systems","220112953_An_Algorithm_for_Drawing_General_Undirected_Graphs","3282289_Heuristic_Layout_Algorithms_for_Network_Management_Presentation_Services","3115111_Methods_for_Visual_Understanding_of_Hierarchical_Systems_Structure","2705917_A_Better_Heuristic_for_Orthogonal_Graph_Drawings"]}
