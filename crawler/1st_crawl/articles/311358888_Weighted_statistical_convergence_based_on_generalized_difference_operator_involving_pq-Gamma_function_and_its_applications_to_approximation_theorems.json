{"id":"311358888_Weighted_statistical_convergence_based_on_generalized_difference_operator_involving_pq-Gamma_function_and_its_applications_to_approximation_theorems","abstract":"In this work, following a new approach of Baliarsingh (Alexandria Eng. J., 2016), we introduce the concepts of statistically weighted -summability, weighted -statistical convergence and weighted strongly -summability with respect to the difference operator including -analogue of Gamma function. Some inclusion relations between newly proposed methods are examined. We then prove a Korovkin type approximation theorem for functions of two variables and also present an example via -analogue of modified Bernstein-Schurer operators to show that our proposed method is stronger than its classical and weighted statistical versions. Furthermore, we compute the rate of convergence of approximating positive linear operators through the modulus of continuity. Finally, we present computational and geometrical approaches to illustrate some of our results in this paper.","authors":["Ugur Kadak"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 448(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2016.11.084"],"references":["303713140_On_weighted_statistical_convergence_based_on_pq-integers_and_related_approximation_theorems_for_functions_of_two_variables","301756607_On_a_fractional_difference_operator","299657197_Approximation_by_p_q-Lorentz_Polynomials_on_a_Compact_Disk","292963248_On_a_Kantorovich_Variant_of_pq-Szasz-Mirakjan_Operators","290393589_On_Kantorovich_modification_of_pq-Baskakov_operators","336126809_A_note_on_paranormed_difference_sequence_spaces_of_fractional_order_and_their_matrix_transformations","313068828_Sur_la_convergence_ordinaire_et_la_convergence_asymptotique_Colloq","292209721_On_p_q-analogue_of_modified_Bernstein-Schurer_operators_for_functions_of_one_and_two_variables","284674646_A_q-analogue_of_the_Bernstein_operator","284263561_On_some_generalized_difference_sequence_spaces","280921340_Some_approximation_results_on_Bernstein-Schurer_operators_defined_by_p_q-integers","279850462_On_certain_Euler_difference_sequence_spaces_of_fractional_order_and_related_dual_properties","278392560_Generalized_Lacunary_Statistical_Difference_Sequence_Spaces_of_Fractional_Order","279520570_L2-Weighted_statistical_convergence_and_Korovkin_and_Voronovskaya_type_theorems","277075324_Some_approximation_results_by_pq-analogue_of_Bernstein-Stancu_operators"]}
