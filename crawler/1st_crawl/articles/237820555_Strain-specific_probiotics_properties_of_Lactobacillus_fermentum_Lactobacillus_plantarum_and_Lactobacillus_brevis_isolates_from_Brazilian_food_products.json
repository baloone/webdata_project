{"id":"237820555_Strain-specific_probiotics_properties_of_Lactobacillus_fermentum_Lactobacillus_plantarum_and_Lactobacillus_brevis_isolates_from_Brazilian_food_products","abstract":"A total of 234 LAB isolates from Brazilian food products were initially screened for their ability to survive at pH 2.0. Fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-PCR and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (10) and Lactobacillus brevis (7). Based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one L. fermentum (CH58), three L. plantarum (CH3, CH41 and SAU96) and two L. brevis (SAU105 and FFC199) were selected. The highest co-aggregation ability with Escherichia coli was observed to L. plantarum CH41. L. brevis SAU105 and FFC199 and L. fermentum CH58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 and L. brevis FFC199 showed adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1.5%). They were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). The present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the isolates L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 (cocoa) and L. brevis FFC199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.","authors":["CÃ­ntia Lacerda Ramos","Line Thorsen","Rosane Freitas Schwan","Lene Jespersen"],"meta":["October 2013Food Microbiology 36(1):22-9","DOI:10.1016/j.fm.2013.03.010","SourcePubMed"],"references":["225064865_Microbiological_and_Physicochemical_Characterization_of_Small-Scale_Cocoa_Fermentations_and_Screening_of_Yeast_and_Bacterial_Strains_To_Develop_a_Defined_Starter_Culture","49669948_Lactobacillus_plantarum_MB452_enhances_the_function_of_the_intestinal_barrier_by_increasing_the_expression_levels_of_genes_involved_in_tight_junction_formation","24312186_Lactobacillus_fermentum_ME-3_-_An_antimicrobial_and_antioxidative_probiotic","7497886_Application_of_Measurements_of_Transepithelial_Electrical_Resistance_of_Intestinal_Epithelial_Cell_Monolayers_To_Evaluate_Probiotic_Activity","5954761_Microbial_population_present_in_fermented_beverage_'cauim'_produced_by_Brazilian_Amerindians","5934360_EzTaxon_a_web-based_tool_for_the_identification_of_prokaryotes_based_on_16S_ribosomal_RNA_gene_sequences","312990278_Selection_criteria_for_lactic_acid_bacteria_to_be_used_as_functional_starter_cultures_in_dry_sausage_production_an_update","311856010_Joint_FAOWHO_Food_and_Agriculture_OrganizationWorld_Health_Organization_Working_Group_Report_on_Drafting_Guidelines_for_the_Evaluation_of_Probiotics_in_Food","307801412_Scientific_Opinion_on_the_maintenance_of_the_list_of_QPS_biological_agents_intentionally_added_to_food_and_feed_2012_update","285687907_Scientific_opinion_on_the_maintenance_of_the_list_of_QPS_biological_agents_intentionally_added_to_food_and_feed","284062558_SISVAR_Um_programa_para_analises_e_ensino_de_estatistica","248558735_In_vitro_comparison_of_probiotic_properties_of_Lactobacillus_casei_Zhang_a_potential_new_probiotic_with_selected_probiotic_strains","240363315_Selection_of_Probiotic_Strains_for_Human_Applications","235961869_Review_on_fermented_plant_material_as_carriers_and_sources_of_potentially_probiotic_lactic_acid_bacteria_-_With_an_emphasis_on_table_olives","235819144_Selection_and_design_of_lactic_acid_bacteria_probiotic_cultures","233826968_Selection_of_potential_probiotic_lactic_acid_bacteria_from_fermented_olives_by_in_vitro_tests","227701073_Adhesion_and_Aggregation_Ability_of_Probiotic_Strain_Lactobacillus_acidophilus_M92","226569038_The_Genera_Lactobacillus_and_Carnobacterium","222280659_Functional_cultures_and_health_benefits","51896300_In_vitro_testing_of_commercial_and_potential_probiotic_lactic_acid_bacteria","51778269_Selection_criteria_for_lactic_acid_bacteria_to_be_used_as_functional_starter_cultures_in_dry_sausage_production_An_update","51569299_Diversity_of_bacteria_and_yeast_in_the_naturally_fermented_cotton_seed_and_rice_beverage_produced_by_Brazilian_Amerindians","51525683_The_investigation_of_probiotic_potential_of_lactic_acid_bacteria_isolated_from_traditional_Mongolian_dairy_products","51124536_Characterization_and_probiotic_potential_of_Lactobacillus_plantarum_strains_isolated_from_cheeses","51055825_Lactic_acid_bacteria_isolated_from_young_calves_-_Characterization_and_potential_as_probiotics","45507810_Microorganisms_associated_with_Maari_a_Baobab_seed_fermented_product","44582164_Evaluation_of_adhesion_capacity_cell_surface_traits_and_immunomodulatory_activity_of_presumptive_probiotic_Lactobacillus_strains","43298783_Determination_of_dynamic_characteristics_of_microbiota_in_a_fermented_beverage_produced_by_Brazilian_Amerindians_using_culture-dependent_and_culture-independent_methods","42369889_Importance_of_lactobacilli_in_food_and_feed_biotechnology","38089660_Non-dairy_probiotic_products","26264018_The_microbiota_of_Lafun_an_African_traditional_cassava_food_product","23187460_Identification_and_in_vitro_characterisation_of_Lactobacillus_plantarum_strains_from_artisanal_Bulgarian_white_brined_cheeses","16754610_Importance_of_Bile_Tolerance_of_Lactobacillus_acidophilus_Used_as_a_Dietary_Adjunct","12204405_Adhesion_autoaggregation_and_hydrophobicity_of_13_strains_of_Bifidobacterium_longum","7682223_Identification_of_potential_starter_cultures_for_Scandinavian-type_fermented_sausages","7067384_Interaction_of_bifidobacteria_with_Caco-2_cells-adhesion_and_impact_on_expression_profiles","6639192_The_microbiology_of_Ghanaian_cocoa_fermentations_analysed_using_culture-dependent_and_culture-independent_methods","5675232_Functional_Properties_of_Lactobacillus_plantarum_Strains_Isolated_from_Maasai_Traditional_Fermented_Milk_Products_in_Kenya"]}
