{"id":"340496555_Production_profiles_in_Brazilian_Science_with_special_attention_to_social_sciences_and_humanities","abstract":"The impact and interaction of science with society is difficult to measure, especially at a national level. In this study, data collected for the quadrennial evaluation (2013â€“2016) of all postgraduate courses in Brazil was used to characterise production by universities as well as their interaction with society as registered in technical services. Over 4 million activities were registered in the 4 years, mainly related to university activities. Production profiles varied according to the area of knowledge. Most patents (over 8700 in total) were in the multidisciplinary and medical areas, followed by engineering, exact, biological and agricultural, 263 in other countries. There were more maps produced by the humanities and more computer applications (apps) in engineering and multidisciplinary. The Humanities, Applied Social Sciences, and Literature, letters and arts also gave more short courses, and appeared on more TV programs and in newspapers, showing greater interaction with the general public than other areas. These areas also offered more technical services, which included evaluating, editing, and writing papers and projects, participating in evaluation committees, event organization, among others. Other types of material included educational videos, folders for divulging scientific activities etc. In the Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature, letters and arts words associated with Law (case, court), Work (Labour, work, managing, plan) and Education are evident. In the life sciences, health is predominant while in the exact sciences analyses linked to agriculture, toxins, water and environment are at the forefront. Most of the external work registered by university lecturers was for governments (local, regional or national). The quality and standardization of the information collected by official means needs to be improved so that useful, timely and relevant impact analyses can be produced more easily.","authors":["Concepta Mcmanus","Abilio Afonso Baeta Neves"],"meta":["April 2020Scientometrics 126(13)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-020-03452-2"],"references":["328162528_Insights_Into_University_Knowledge_Transfer_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_SSH_and_Other_Scientific_Disciplines_-_More_Similarities_Than_Differences","327024621_Vanishing_industries_and_the_rising_monopoly_of_universities_in_published_research","320926256_One_decade_of_environmental_education_research_in_Brazil_trajectories_and_trends_in_three_national_scientific_conferences_ANPEd_ANPPAS_and_EPEA","320737203_Measuring_impact_in_the_humanities_Learning_from_accountability_and_economics_in_a_contemporary_history_of_cultural_value","318120018_Knowledge_Transfer_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_SSH_-_Definition_Motivators_Obstacles_and_Visions","315768578_Productive_interactions_societal_impact_of_academic_research_in_the_knowledge_society","301528961_The_Four_'I's_Quality_Indicators_for_the_Humanities","290395998_Knowledge_exchange_between_academics_and_the_business_public_and_third_sectors","272350525_Authors_report_lack_of_time_as_main_reason_for_unpublished_research_presented_at_biomedical_conferences_A_systematic_review","247157266_Building_on_faults_How_to_represent_controversies_with_digital_methods","220365383_Canadian_Collaboration_Networks_a_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Natural_Sciences_Social_Sciences_and_the_Humanities","28577356_University_Industry_Relationships_and_Open_Innovation_Towards_a_Research_Agenda","24008474_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_the_Propensity_of_Academics_to_Engage_in_Informal_University_Technology_Transfer","328184188_The_strategic_orientation_of_universities_in_knowledge_transfer_activities","324099589_The_Long-lasting_Effects_of_Newspaper_Op-Eds_on_Public_Opinion","319043066_Shake_up_conferences","318471345_Setting_the_agenda_The_mass_media_and_public_opinion","272568613_Strategic_science_with_policy_impact","266624668_Can_media_monitoring_be_a_proxy_for_public_opinion_about_technoscientific_controversies_The_case_of_the_Italian_public_debate_on_nuclear_power","259962430_Knowledge_transfer_activities_in_social_sciences_and_humanities_Explaining_the_interactions_of_research_groups_with_non-academic_agents","258317353_Informal_collaborations_between_social_sciences_and_humanities_researchers_and_non-academic_partners","227421718_Evidence_on_how_academics_manage_their_portfolio_of_knowledge_transfer_activities","222422968_University-industry_linkages_in_the_UK_What_are_the_factors_underlying_the_variety_of_interactions_with_industry","5212492_Understanding_the_emergence_of_'open_science'_institutions_Functionalist_economics_in_historical_context"]}
