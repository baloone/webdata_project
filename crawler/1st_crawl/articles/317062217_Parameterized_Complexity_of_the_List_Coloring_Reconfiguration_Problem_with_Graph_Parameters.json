{"id":"317062217_Parameterized_Complexity_of_the_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_with_Graph_Parameters","abstract":"Let $G$ be a graph such that each vertex has its list of available colors, and assume that each list is a subset of the common set consisting of $k$ colors. For two given list colorings of $G$, we study the problem of transforming one into the other by changing only one vertex color assignment at a time, while at all times maintaining a list coloring. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for bounded bandwidth graphs and a fixed constant $k$. In this paper, we study the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem when parameterized by several graph parameters. We first give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem when parameterized by $k$ and the modular-width of an input graph. We next give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the shortest variant when parameterized by $k$ and the size of a minimum vertex cover of an input graph. As corollaries, we show that the problem for cographs and the shortest variant for split graphs are fixed-parameter tractable even when only $k$ is taken as a parameter. On the other hand, we prove that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized only by the size of a minimum vertex cover of an input graph.","authors":["Tatsuhiko Hatanaka","Takehiro Ito","Xiao Zhou"],"meta":["May 2017Theoretical Computer Science 739(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2018.05.005"],"references":["281262549_A_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_Circular_Colouring_Reconfiguration","276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","264708930_Homomorphism_reconfiguration_via_homotopy","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","255787103_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Modular-Width","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","2396924_Implicit_Representation_of_Graphs","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","267373223_Mixing_Graph_Colourings","264005478_The_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_for_Bounded_Pathwidth_Graphs","262071298_Reconfiguration_in_bounded_bandwidth_and_treedepth","261289085_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring","242913776_Implicat_Representation_of_Graphs","235601904_Recoloring_bounded_treewidth_graphs","226376494_Transitiv_orientbare_Graphen","222418571_A_Survey_on_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Modular_Decomposition","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220570220_Linear_Time_Modular_Decomposition_of_Directed_Graphs","220345186_Randomly_coloring_sparse_random_graphs_with_fewer_colors_than_the_maximum_degree","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148982_Finding_Paths_between_graph_colourings_PSPACE-completeness_and_superpolynomial_distances"]}
