{"id":"243015010_On_the_Role_of_Applied_Mathematics","abstract":"This paper concerns itself with the nature of applied mathematics, and how to make its role effective. Its differences from pure mathematics and from theoretical sciences are pointed out with the help of illustrative examples. Recommendations are made for supporting a program of education and research in applied mathematics to make it an independent scientific discipline and to create a community of applied mathematicians.","authors":["C.C.
