{"id":"300020414_Distance-Based_Analysis_of_Crossover_Operators_for_Many-Objective_Knapsack_Problems","abstract":"It has been reported for multi-objective knapsack problems that the recombination of similar parents often improves the performance of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms. Recently performance improvement was also reported by exchanging only a small number of genes between two parents (i.e., crossover with a very small gene exchange probability) without choosing similar parents. In this paper, we examine these performance improvement schemes through computational experiments where NSGA-II is applied to 500-item knapsack problems with 2-10 objectives. We measure the parent-parent distance and the parent-offspring distance in computational experiments. Clear performance improvement is observed when the parent-offspring distance is small. To further examine this observation, we implement a distance-based crossover operator where the parent-offspring distance is specified as a user-defined parameter. Performance of NSGA-II is examined for various parameter values. Experimental results show that an appropriate parameter value (parent-offspring distance) is surprisingly small. It is also shown that a very small parameter value is beneficial for diversity maintenance.","authors":["Hisao Ishibuchi","Yuki Tanigaki","Hiroyuki Masuda","Yusuke Nojima"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10762-2_59","Conference: International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature"],"references":["222030993_SMS-EMOA_Multiobjective_selection_based_on_dominated_hypervolume","221271131_Inbreeding_Properties_of_Geometric_Crossover_and_Non-geometric_Recombinations","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","2952382_Topological_Interpretation_of_Crossover","290109684_Relation_between_Neighborhood_Size_and_MOEAD_Performance_on_Many-Objective_Problems","274263562_Behavior_of_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_on_Many-Objective_Knapsack_Problems","262272552_Recombination_of_Similar_Parents_in_SMS-EMOA_on_Many-Objective_01_Knapsack_Problems","249334866_Variable_Space_Diversity_Crossover_and_Mutation_in_MOEA_Solving_Many-objective_Knapsack_Problems","224330083_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_A_Short_Review","224170493_Diversity_Improvement_by_Non-Geometric_Binary_Crossover_in_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Optimization","220381049_A_Fast_Way_of_Calculating_Exact_Hypervolumes","4940076_An_empirical_study_on_similarity-based_mating_for_evolutionary_multiobjective_combinatorial_optimization","4939568_Local_dominance_and_local_recombination_in_MOEAs_on_01_multiobjective_knapsack_problems","4871760_Jaszkiewicz_A_On_the_Computational_Efficiency_of_Multiple_Objective_Metaheuristics_The_Knapsack_Problem_Case_Study_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_158_418-433","4329419_Behavior_of_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","2240388_Thiele_L_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Case_Study_and_the_Strength_Pareto_Approach_IEEE_Trans_on_Evolutionary_Computation_3_257-271"]}
