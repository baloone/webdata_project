{"id":"338593920_Funding_information_in_Web_of_Science_An_updated_overview","abstract":"Despite the limitations of funding acknowledgment (FA) data in Web of Science (WoS), studies using FA information have increased rapidly over the last several years. Considering this WoS'recent practice of updating funding data, this paper further investigates the characteristics and distribution of FA data in four WoS journal citation indexes. The research reveals that FA information coverage variances persist cross all four citation indexes by time coverage, language and document type. Our evidence suggests an improvement in FA information collection in humanity and social science research. Departing from previous studies, we argue that FA text (FT) alone no longer seems an appropriate field to retrieve and analyze funding information, since a substantial number of documents only report funding agency or grant number information in respective fields. Articles written in Chinese have a higher FA presence rate than other non-English WoS publications. This updated study concludes with a discussion of new findings and practical guidance for the future retrieval and analysis of funded research.","authors":["Weishu Liu","Li Tang","Guangyuan Hu"],"meta":["January 2020Scientometrics 122(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-020-03362-3","Project: Characteristics and defects of bibliographic database(Web of Science/Scopus)"],"references":["335996587_The_data_source_of_this_study_is_Web_of_Science_Core_Collection_Not_enough","333103052_Early_insights_on_the_Emerging_Sources_Citation_Index_ESCI_an_overlay_map-based_bibliometric_study","332436233_Searching_by_grant_number_comparison_of_funding_acknowledgments_in_NIH_RePORTER_PubMed_and_Web_of_Science","330055508_Solving_multiple-criteria_RD_project_selection_problems_with_a_data-driven_evidential_reasoning_rule","332102350_The_secrets_behind_Web_of_Science's_DOI_search","331634742_What_characterises_funded_biomedical_research_Evidence_from_a_basic_and_a_clinical_domain","329786025_DOI_errors_and_possible_solutions_for_Web_of_Science","328582525_How_to_automatically_identify_major_research_sponsors_selecting_keywords_from_the_WoS_Funding_Agency_field","328235013_Does_the_concentration_of_scientific_research_funding_in_institutions_promote_knowledge_output","327854727_Pathogenic_organization_in_science_Division_of_labor_and_retractions"]}
