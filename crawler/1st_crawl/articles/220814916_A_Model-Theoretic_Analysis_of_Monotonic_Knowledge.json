{"id":"220814916_A_Model-Theoretic_Analysis_of_Monotonic_Knowledge","abstract":"We present a semantic model for knowledge with the following properties: (1) Knowledge is necessarily correct, (2) agents are logi­ cally omniscient, i.e., they know all the consequences of their knowledge, and (3) agents are positively introspective, i.e., they are aware of their knowledge, but not negatively introspective, i.e., they may not be aware of their ignorance. We argue that this is the appropriate model for implicit knowledge. We investigate the pro- perties of the model, and use it to formalize the notion of cir­ cumscribed knowledge.","authors":["Moshe Vardi"],"meta":["January 1985","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 9th international joint conference on Artificial intelligence - Volume 1"],"references":["294684571_Knowledge_and_Belief","284046079_Semantical_analysis_of_modal_logic","284024085_Towards_a_theory_of_knowledge_and_ignorance","268978974_Circumscription_---_A_Form_of_Nonmonotonic_Reasoning","249641873_An_internal_semantics_for_modal_logic","248777048_On_alternatives_in_epistemic_logic","244957232_A_guide_to_the_modal_logics_of_knowledge_and_belief","239577899_A_formal_theory_of_knowledge_and_action","237128408_Recent_Work_in_Epistemic_Logic","230482395_A_Logic_of_Knowledge","39040029_A_Study_of_Kripke-type_Models_of_Some_Modal_Logics_by_Gentzen's_Sequential_Method","2606432_A_Model-Theoretic_Analysis_of_Knowledge","224945038_Personal_Communication","221604157_Circumscriptive_Ignorance","221603048_A_Logic_of_Implicit_and_Explicit_Belief"]}
