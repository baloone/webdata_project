{"id":"315382660_Exact_Distance_Colouring_in_Trees","abstract":"For an integer $q\\ge 2$ and an even integer $d$, consider the graph obtained from a large complete $q$-ary tree by connecting with an edge any two vertices at distance exactly $d$ in the tree. This graph has clique number $q+1$, and the purpose of this short note is to prove that its chromatic number is $\\Theta\\big(\\tfrac{d \\log q}{\\log d}\\big)$. It was not known that the chromatic number of this graph grows with $d$. As a simple corollary of our result, we give a negative answer to a problem of van den Heuvel and Naserasr, asking whether there is a constant $C$ such that for any odd integer $d$, any planar graph can be colored with at most $C$ colors such that any pair of vertices at distance exactly $d$ have distinct colors. Finally, we study interval coloring of trees (where vertices at distance at least $d$ and at most $cd$, for some real $c>1$, must be assigned distinct colors), giving a sharp upper bound in the case of bounded degree trees.","authors":["Nicolas Bousquet","Louis Esperet","Ararat Harutyunyan","RÃ©mi de Joannis de Verclos"],"meta":["March 2017Combinatorics Probability and Computing 28(2)","DOI:10.1017/S0963548318000378"],"references":["315489409_Colouring_exact_distance_graphs_of_chordal_graphs","313097563_Chromatic_numbers_for_the_hyperbolic_plane_and_discrete_analogs","311492510_Chromatic_Numbers_of_Exact_Distance_Graphs","284920380_On_Low_Tree-Depth_Decompositions","268227401_Chromatic_numbers_of_hyperbolic_surfaces","267000461_Sparsity_Graphs_Structures_and_Algorithms","236688102_Coloring_distance_graphs_a_few_answers_and_many_questions"]}
