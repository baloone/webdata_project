This article tries to model and finally improve process of remittance and withdrawal from current account (ordinary and golden) of bank with use of discrete simulation methodology. For this purpose, the said process is identified and then a logical model is simulated with use of ED model (Enterprise Dynamic) for identification of the said model process and data relating to each entity is obtained with use of chronometry and then sample volume has been calculated. For validation and confirmation of the model, a comparison between results of simulation and real measurement has been made by statistical tests. In the next stage, two criteria which include output of the customers and average waiting time of the customers are selected and some suggestions were presented for improvement of remittance and withdrawal processes with regard to the obtained results.","authors":["Mohammad Ali Afshar Kazemi","Abbas Toloie Eshlaghy","P.D.-S.
