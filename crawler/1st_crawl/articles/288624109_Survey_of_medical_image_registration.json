{"id":"288624109_Survey_of_medical_image_registration","abstract":"Computerized Image Registration approaches can offer automatic and accurate image alignments without extensive user involvement and provide tools for visualizing combined images. The aim of this survey is to present a review of publications related to Medical Image Registration. This paper paints a comprehensive picture of image registration methods and their applications. This paper is an introduction for those new to the ﬁeld, an overview for those working in the ﬁeld and a reference for those searching for literature on a speciﬁc application. Methods are classiﬁed according to the diﬀerent aspects of Medical Image Registration.\nKeywords:\nimage registration deformable model multimodal extrinsic elastic rigid non rigid voxel based feature based","authors":["V.R.s Mani","Arivazhagan Selvaraj"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Technology 1(2):8-25"],"references":["315797588_Nonrigid_Registration_of_3-D_Free-Hand_Ultrasound_Images_of_the_Breast","329530658_Medical_image_registration","313442276_Coupling_dense_and_landmark-based_approaches_for_non_rigid_registration","313104765_Multi-view_contourless_registration_of_bone_structures_using_a_single_calibrated_X-ray_fluoroscope","303968646_OPTIMAL_REGISTRATION_OF_DEFORMED_IMAGES","291154059_Principal_warps_Thin-plate_splines_and_the_decomposition_of_deformations","284775472_MRI-PET_correlation_in_3_dimensions_using_a_Volume_of_Interest_VOI_atlas","281155773_Image_matching_as_a_diffusion_process_An_analogy_with_Maxwell's_demons","264930741_Second_order_elliptic_equations_and_elliptic_systems_Transl_from_the_Chinese_by_Bei_Hu","262642374_Multiresolution_elastic_matching"]}
