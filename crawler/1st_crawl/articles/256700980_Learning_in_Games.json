{"id":"256700980_Learning_in_Games","abstract":"This essay discusses some recent work on `learning in games'. We explore non-equilibrium theories in which equilibrium emerges as the long-run outcome of a dynamic process of adjustment or learning. We focus on individual level models, and more specifically on variants of `fictitious play' in two-player games. We discuss both the theoretical properties of the models and their relationship to regularities observed in game theory experiments.","authors":["Drew Fudenberg","David Levine"],"meta":["May 1998European Economic Review 42(s 3–5):631–639","DOI:10.1016/S0014-2921(98)00011-7","SourceRePEc"],"references":["238260529_Learning_in_evolutionary_games_some_laboratory_results","4935010_Experience-Weighted_Attraction_Learning_in_Games_A_Unifying_Approach","2423872_Measuring_Players'_Losses_In_Experimental_Games","2292257_Learning_Processes_Mixed_Equilibria_and_Dynamical_Systems_Arising_from_Repeated_Games","313427708_Controlled_random_walks","242580265_Approximation_to_Bayes_risk_in_repeated_play","222504797_Learning_in_Extensive_Form_Games_Experimental_Data_and_Simple_Dynamic_Models_in_the_Intermediate_Run","222502121_Consistency_and_Cautious_Fictitious_Play","220045412_Adoption_in_Natural_and_Artificial_System","24091367_Considerations_of_Fairness_and_Strategy_Experimental_Data_from_Sequential_Games","13573865_On_Learning_To_Become_a_Successful_Loser_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Abstractions_of_Learning_Processes_in_the_Loss_Domain","5177006_Learning_Mixed_Equilibria","4952209_Coordination_Magic_and_Reinforcement_Learning_in_a_Market_Entry_Game","4820305_Measuring_Subject's_Losses_in_Experimental_Games","4784334_Belief_Affirming_in_Learning_Processes","4767702_Three_Problems_in_Learning_Mixed-Strategy_Nash_Equilibria"]}
