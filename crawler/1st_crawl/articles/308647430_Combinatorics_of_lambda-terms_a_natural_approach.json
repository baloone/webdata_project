{"id":"308647430_Combinatorics_of_lambda-terms_a_natural_approach","abstract":"We consider combinatorial aspects of $\\lambda$-terms in the model based on de Bruijn indices where each building constructor is of size one. Surprisingly, the counting sequence for $\\lambda$-terms corresponds also to two families of binary trees, namely black-white trees and zigzag-free ones. We provide a constructive proof of this fact by exhibiting appropriate bijections. Moreover, we identify the sequence of Motzkin numbers with the counting sequence for neutral $\\lambda$-terms, giving a bijection which, in consequence, results in an exact-size sampler for the latter based on the exact-size sampler for Motzkin trees of Bodini et alli. Using the powerful theory of analytic combinatorics, we state several results concerning the asymptotic growth rate of $\\lambda$-terms in neutral, normal, and head normal forms. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic density of $\\lambda$-terms containing arbitrary fixed subterms showing that, inter alia, strongly normalising or typeable terms are asymptotically negligible in the set of all $\\lambda$-terms.","authors":["Maciej Bendkowski","Katarzyna Grygiel","Pierre Lescanne","Marek Zaionc"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Logic and Computation 27(8)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exx018"],"references":["284219503_Counting_and_Generating_Terms_in_the_Binary_Lambda_Calculus_Extended_version","282072300_On_the_number_of_lambda_terms_with_prescribed_size_of_their_De_Bruijn_representation","277958792_A_natural_counting_of_Lambda_terms","275896923_Generic_algorithms_for_halting_problem_and_optimal_machines_revisited","275274343_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Combinatory_Logic","259529016_Counting_Terms_in_the_Binary_Lambda_Calculus","314605515_A_Natural_Counting_of_Lambda_Terms","281985313_Exact-size_Sampling_for_Motzkin_Trees_in_Linear_Time_via_Boltzmann_Samplers_and_Holonomic_Specification","277416849_GFUN_A_Maple_Package_for_the_Manipulation_of_Generating_and_Holonomic_Functions_in_One_Variable","264923999_The_lambda_calculus_its_syntax_and_semantics_Reprint_of_the_1984_revised_ed"]}
