{"id":"321141012_Optimal_Cluster_Expansion-Based_Intrusion_Tolerant_System_to_Prevent_Denial_of_Service_Attacks","abstract":"In this study, we propose an optimal cluster expansion-based intrusion-tolerant system (ITS) that can maintain quality of service (QoS) under a massive denial of service (DoS) attack. Our proposed scheme conserves resources while maintaining good QoS by optimally increasing and decreasing cluster size. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we use a CloudSim simulator and compare our proposed scheme with an existing conventional adaptive cluster transformation (ACT) scheme. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional ACT scheme in terms of better QoS and lower resource consumption.","authors":["Hyun Kwon","Yongchul Kim","Hyunsoo Yoon","Daeseon Choi"],"meta":["November 2017Applied Sciences 7(11):1186","DOI:10.3390/app7111186"],"references":["290006308_Design_of_a_Secure_System_Considering_Quality_of_Service","235417226_An_Intrusion_Detection_And_Prevention_System_In_Cloud_Computing_A_Systematic_Review","225734133_Intrusion-Tolerant_Architectures_Concepts_and_Design","224483602_Highly_Available_Intrusion-Tolerant_Services_with_Proactive-Reactive_Recovery","313852398_A_Survey_on_Intrusion-Tolerant_System","303704383_Queuing_Model_of_the_Access_System_in_the_Packet_Network","299544165_Hybrid_Recovery-Based_Intrusion_Tolerant_System_for_Practical_Cyber-Defense","272211831_A_Novel_Intrusion_Tolerant_System_Using_Live_Migration","257666305_A_novel_Adaptive_Cluster_Transformation_ACT-based_intrusion_tolerant_architecture_for_hybrid_information_technology","221238045_Response_time_for_cloud_computing_providers"]}
