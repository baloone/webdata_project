{"id":"322024478_On_M-metric_spaces_and_fixed_point_theorems","abstract":"In this paper we make some observations concerning M-metric spaces and point out some discrepancies in the proofs found in the literature. To remedy this, we propose a new topological construction and prove that it is in fact a generalization of a partial metric space. Then, using this construction, we present our main theorem having as its corollaries the fixed point theorems found in previous publications.","authors":["Samer Assaf"],"meta":["January 2019Topology Proceedings 54:81-102"],"references":["265052270_Partial_metric_spaces_with_negative_distances_and_fixed_point_theorems","259762674_New_extension_of_p-metric_spaces_with_some_fixed-point_results_on_M-metric_spaces","243118659_Partial_Metric_Spaces","274829507_Nonunique_fixed_point_theorems_in_partial_metric_spaces","251602351_Fixed_point_theorems_for_operators_on_partial_metric_spaces","229470329_Partial_Metrics_Valuations_and_Domain_Theory","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology"]}
