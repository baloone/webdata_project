{"id":"329680375_Dermatoscopy_in_clinical_practice_Beyond_pigmented_lesions","abstract":"Dermoscopy has increasingly been taken up in general dermatology practice in the USA as a non-invasive technique for the differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions. Videodermatoscopy - dermoscopy using a digital system - allows a higher-magnified observation of the skin surface and has also been used for other investigations, such as monitoring the progress of therapy for dermatologic conditions, with some success. This book aims to advance knowledge of these additional uses of videodermatoscopy beyond the usual indication for pigmented lesions of the skin.","authors":["G.
