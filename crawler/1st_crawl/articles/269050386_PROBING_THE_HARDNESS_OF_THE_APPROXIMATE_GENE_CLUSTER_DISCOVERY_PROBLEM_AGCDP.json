{"id":"269050386_PROBING_THE_HARDNESS_OF_THE_APPROXIMATE_GENE_CLUSTER_DISCOVERY_PROBLEM_AGCDP","abstract":"We present a polynomial-time transformation of the input for a variant of Median String Problem (MSP) that employs Hamming distance into the input for Approximate Gene Cluster Discovery Problem (AGCDP). Since MSP is NP-complete, the transformation forms the integral part of the reduction of MSP into AGCDP, for all input instances, such that AGCDP is confirmed to be NP-hard.\n\nRead More: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814612883_0003","authors":["G.
