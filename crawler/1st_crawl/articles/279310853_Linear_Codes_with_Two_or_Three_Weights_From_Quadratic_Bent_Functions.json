{"id":"279310853_Linear_Codes_with_Two_or_Three_Weights_From_Quadratic_Bent_Functions","abstract":"Linear codes with few weights have applications in secrete sharing, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular graphs. In this paper, several classes of p-ary linear codes with two or three weights are constructed from quadratic Bent functions over the finite field Fp\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$${\\mathbb {F}}_p$$\\end{document}, where p is an odd prime. They include some earlier linear codes as special cases. The weight distributions of these linear codes are also determined.","authors":["Zhengchun Zhou","Nian Li","Cuiling Fan","Tor Helleseth"],"meta":["November 2016Designs Codes and Cryptography 81(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-015-0144-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","346402843_Codes_for_Error_Detection","274012549_Linear_Codes_From_Some_2-Designs","267659770_Three-weight_codes_and_association_schemes","265546635_Near-MDS_codes_for_error_detection","264791605_New_Constructions_of_Quadratic_Bent_Functions_in_Polynomial_Form","262404350_Perfect_nonlinear_binomials_and_their_semifields","256391988_On_bent_functions","251093742_Planes_of_order_n_with_collineation_groups_of_order_n_2","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics"]}
