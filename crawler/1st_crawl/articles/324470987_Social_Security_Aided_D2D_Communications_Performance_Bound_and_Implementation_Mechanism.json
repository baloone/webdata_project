{"id":"324470987_Social_Security_Aided_D2D_Communications_Performance_Bound_and_Implementation_Mechanism","abstract":"In a device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular network, any user is a potential eavesdropper for the transmissions of others that occupy the same spectrum. Physical-layer security mechanism is typically employed to guarantee secure communications, at the cost of reducing the systemâ€™s throughput. As hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we may leverage their social trust to decrease the number of potential eavesdroppers. Aiming to establish a new paradigm for solving the challenging problem of security and efficiency tradeoff, we propose a social security aware D2D communication architecture that exploits social-domain trust for securing physical-domain communication. In order to understand the impact of social trust on the security of transmissions, we analyze the system ergodic rate of social security aided communications via stochastic geometry, and our result based on a real dataset shows that the proposed social security aided D2D communication increases the system secrecy rate by about 63% compared to the scheme without considering social trust relation. Furthermore, in order to provide implementation mechanism, we utilize matching theory to implement efficient resource allocation among multiple users. Numerical results show that our proposed mechanism increases the system secrecy rate by 28% with fast convergence over the social oblivious approach.","authors":["Yulei Zhao","Yong Li","Lin Chen","Yang Cao"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JSAC.2018.2825658"],"references":["276074505_Social-Aware_Peer_Discovery_for_D2D_Communications_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","275347526_A_Stochastic_Geometry_Analysis_of_D2D_Overlaying_Multi-Channel_Downlink_Cellular_Networks","275061284_Safeguarding_5G_Wireless_Communication_Networks_Using_Physical_Layer_Security","273398187_Social_Network_Aware_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Wireless_Networks","269298515_SoCast_Social_ties_based_cooperative_video_multicast","267395923_Matching_Theory_for_Future_Wireless_Networks_Fundamentals_and_Applications","254061548_Operator_controlled_Device-to-Device_communications_in_LTE-Advanced_networks","236936093_Power_Control_for_D2D_Underlaid_Cellular_Networks_Modeling_Algorithms_and_Analysis","224585427_Stochastic_Geometry_and_Random_Graphs_for_the_Analysis_and_Design_of_Wireless_Networks","224088484_Device-to-Device_communication_as_an_underlay_to_LTE-Advanced_networks","221242732_Seen_as_stable_marriages","220486705_A_Quantitative_Measure_Of_Fairness_And_Discrimination_For_Resource_Allocation_In_Shared_Computer_Systems","277903180_Matching_and_Cheating_in_Device_to_Device_Communications_Underlying_Cellular_Networks","273474891_Security_and_Performance_Challenges_for_User-Centric_Wireless_Networking","273396710_Spectrum_Sharing_for_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","273396273_Interference_Exploitation_in_D2D-Enabled_Cellular_Networks_A_Secrecy_Perspective","271472863_Scheduling_in_a_secure_wireless_network","269328153_Efficient_resource_allocation_for_mobile_social_networks_in_D2D_communication_underlaying_cellular_networks","269298347_A_college_admissions_game_for_uplink_user_association_in_wireless_small_cell_networks","269298262_A_social_group_utility_maximization_framework_with_applications_in_database_assisted_spectrum_access","269297954_Social-aware_multi-file_dissemination_in_Device-to-Device_overlay_networks","265440762_Integer_programming","263813382_Coalitional_Games_for_Resource_Allocation_in_the_Device-to-Device_Uplink_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263285605_Social-Aware_D2D_Communications_Qualitative_Insights_and_Quantitative_Analysis","262416970_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_5G_Cellular_Networks_Challenges_Solutions_and_Future_Directions","262311814_Social_trust_and_social_reciprocity_based_cooperative_D2D_communications","224230434_Physical_layer_security_in_wireless_networks_A_tutorial"]}
