The μRNG combines the entropy of multiple independent sources to generate an output bitstream that is indistinguishable from an ideal unbiased entropy source. Three independent self-calibrating all-digital entropy sources, coupled with XOR feedback shift-register based correlation suppressors and an in-line compact Barak-Impagliazzo-Wigderson (BIW) extractor enable ultra-low energy consumption of 3 pJ/full-entropy bit with a dense layout occupying 1008 μm², while achieving: (i) 162.5 Mbps full-entropy throughput at 1.3 GHz operation, with total power consumption of 1.5 mW and leakage power component of 90 μW, measured at 0.75 V, 25°C, (ii) mutually uncorrelated raw bitstreams from the three entropy sources with phi-coefficient cross-correlation <0.003, (iii) extracted full-entropy bitstream that passes all 16 NIST RNG tests with measured Shannon entropy up to 0.9999999995, and lower-bound min-entropy H∞ > 0.99, (iv) hysteresis-free extracted output for lags 1-1000, with ACF ~0 within 95% confidence bounds of a Gaussian distribution (μ=0,σ²=0.002), (v) wide operating supply voltage range of 300-950 mV with throughput scaling to 225 Mbps at 950 mV and robust sub-threshold voltage performance of 400 Kbps, 4 μW, measured at 300 mV, 25°C, (vi) peak energy-efficiency of 323 Gbps/W at near-threshold voltage of 400 mV, with full-entropy throughput of 8.6 Mbps, total power consumption of 27 μW, (vii) 6.5x reduction in gate count and 5.4x lower energy consumption compared to conventional AES-based entropy extractors.","authors":["Sanu K.
