{"id":"295257888_Sanskrit_Machine_Translation_Systems_A_Comparative_Analysis","abstract":"Machine Translation is area of research since six decades. It is gaining popularity since last decade due to better computational facilities available at personal computer systems. This paper presents different Machine Translation system where Sanskrit is involved as source, target or key support language. Researchers employ various techniques like Rule based, Corpus based, Direct for machine translation. The main aim to focus on Sanskrit in Machine Translation in this paper is to uncover the language suitability, its morphology and employ appropriate MT techniques.","authors":["Jaideepsinh K.","Jatinderkumar R.
