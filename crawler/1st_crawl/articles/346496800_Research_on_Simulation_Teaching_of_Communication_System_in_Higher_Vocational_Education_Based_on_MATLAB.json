{"id":"346496800_Research_on_Simulation_Teaching_of_Communication_System_in_Higher_Vocational_Education_Based_on_MATLAB","abstract":"With the rapid development of modern computer science and technology, a new generation of visual simulation software MATLAB has been developed. These powerful simulation software make the design and analysis of communication system simulation relatively intuitive and convenient, which also makes the communication system simulation technology get faster development. Through the dynamic simulation environment of MATLAB/Simulink, we can build a digital communication system simulation platform for design and simulation, which fully shows the importance of MATLAB/Simulink in the communication system. This paper mainly analyses the application of MATLAB in communication system simulation. Then this paper analyses the basic principle of DSB signal, the simulation of modulation signal based on M file and the mdl file.","authors":["Yuxia Zhou"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1648(4):042008","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1648/4/042008"],"references":["317014918_Necessary_but_Insufficient_Why_Measurement_Invariance_Tests_Need_Online_Probing_as_a_Complementary_Tool","322240243_Announcement_Corrections_in_Physical_Review_publications"]}
