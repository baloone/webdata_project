{"id":"268664154_Solving_the_Weighted_Parity_Problem_for_Gammoids_by_Reduction_to_Graphic_Matching","abstract":"It is shown that the weighted parity problem for gammoids, with matching and transversal matroids as special cases, can be reduced to the weighted graphic matching problem. Since the cycle matroids of a series parallel graph is a gammoid, this means that it is possible to solve the weighted parity problem for the cycle matroid of a series parallel graph by graphic matching.","authors":["Po Tong","E.L.
