{"id":"280590385_Building_an_iterative_heuristic_solver_for_a_quantum_annealer","abstract":"A quantum annealer heuristically minimizes quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) problems, but is limited by the physical hardware in the\nsize and density of the problems it can handle. We have developed a\nmeta-heuristic solver that utilizes D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer (or any\nother QUBO problem optimizer) to solve larger or denser problems, by\niteratively solving subproblems, while keeping the rest of the variables fixed.\nWe present our algorithm, several variants, and the results for the\noptimization of standard QUBO problem instances from OR-Library of sizes 500\nand 2500 as well as the Palubeckis instances of sizes 3000 to 7000. For\npractical use of the solver, we show the dependence of the time to best\nsolution on the desired gap to the best known solution. In addition, we study\nthe dependence of the gap and the time to best solution on the size of the\nproblems solved by the underlying optimizer.","authors":["Gili Rosenberg","Mohammad Vazifeh","Brad Woods","Eldad Haber"],"meta":["December 2016Computational Optimization and Applications 65(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10589-016-9844-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["286301759_What_is_the_Computational_Value_of_Finite_Range_Tunneling","283664226_A_quantum_annealing_architecture_with_all-to-all_connectivity_from_local_interactions","275974251_Seeking_Quantum_Speedup_Through_Spin_Glasses_The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly","321600152_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Optimization_Supplement_Volume_A","319335777_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Optimization","313491405_Continuous_approaches_for_solving_discrete_optimization_problems","311556988_Memetic_algorithms_for_the_unconstrained_binary_quadratic_programming_problem","303395525_Error_correction_for_encoded_quantum_annealing","290527271_Simulated_Quantum_Annealing_Can_Be_Exponentially_Faster_Than_Classical_Simulated_Annealing","283471584_Error_correction_for_a_proposed_quantum_annealing_architecture"]}
