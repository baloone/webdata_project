{"id":"354597412_About_the_type_of_modal_logics_for_the_unification_problem","abstract":"In this thesis, we shall investigate the unification problem in ordinary modal logics, fusions of two modal logics, and multi-modal epistemic logics. With respect to a propositional logic L, given a formula A, we have to find substitutions s such that s(A) is in L. When they exist, these substitutions are called unifiers of A in L. We study different methods for the construction of minimal complete sets of unifiers of a given formula A and according to the cardinality of these minimal complete sets, we shall discuss the unification type of A. Then, we determine the unification types of several propositional logics.","authors":["Maryam Rostamigiv"],"meta":["September 2020"],"references":["344278119_About_the_unification_type_of_fusions_of_modal_logics","337621879_Remarks_about_the_unification_type_of_several_non-symmetric_non-transitive_modal_logics","337388248_Elementary_unification_in_modal_logic_KD45","325828344_Projective_unification_in_transitive_modal_logics","319567809_Unification_in_epistemic_logics","293799769_A_Syntactic_Approach_to_Unification_in_Transitive_Reflexive_Modal_Logics","284528353_A_Machine-Oriented_Logic_based_on_the_Resolution_Principle","282375592_An_observation_concerning_porte's_rule_in_modal_logic","279719249_Epistemic_Logic_and_Information_Update","268863827_Unitary_unification_of_S5_modal_logic_and_its_extensions"]}
