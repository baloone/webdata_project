{"id":"308031060_Sequential_improvement_for_robust_optimization_using_an_uncertainty_measure_for_radial_basis_functions","abstract":"The performance of the sequential metamodel based optimization procedure depends strongly on the chosen building blocks for the algorithm, such as the used meta-modeling method and sequential improvement criterion. In this study, the effect of these choices on the efficiency of the robust optimization procedure is investigated. A novel sequential improvement criterion for robust optimization is proposed, as well as an improved implementation of radial basis function interpolation suitable for sequential optimization. The leave-one-out cross-validation measure is used to estimate the uncertainty of the radial basis function metamodel. The metamodeling methods and sequential improvement criteria are compared, based on a test with Gaussian random fields as well as on the optimization of a strip bending process with five design variables and two noise variables. For this process, better results are obtained in the runs with the novel sequential improvement criterion as well as with the novel radial basis function implementation , compared to the runs with conventional sequential improvement criteria and kriging interpolation.","authors":["Jos Havinga","Ton Van den Boogaard","· G Klaseboer"],"meta":["April 2017Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization 55(4):1345–1363","DOI:10.1007/s00158-016-1572-5"],"references":["265574083_Design_and_analysis_of_computer_experiments_With_comments_and_a_rejoinder_by_the_authors","262572034_Robust_optimization_of_foam-filled_thin-walled_structure_based_on_sequential_Kriging_metamodel","310752330_Scattered_data_interpolation_Tests_of_some_methods","304197277_Kriging_Metamodeling_in_Simulation_A_Review","292124145_A_statistical_approach_to_some_basic_mine_valuation_problems_on_the_Witwatersrand","272040382_Sequential_approximate_robust_design_optimization_using_radial_basis_function_network","269329367_An_adaptive_radial_basis_function_method_using_weighted_improvement","266703698_Nonlinear_Metamodeling_of_Bulky_Data_and_Applications_in_Automotive_Design","263523566_Robustness_Measures_and_Numerical_Approximation_of_the_Cumulative_Density_Function_of_Response_Surfaces","262812917_Performance_Improvement_of_a_Return_Channel_in_a_Multistage_Centrifugal_Compressor_Using_Multiobjective_Optimization"]}
