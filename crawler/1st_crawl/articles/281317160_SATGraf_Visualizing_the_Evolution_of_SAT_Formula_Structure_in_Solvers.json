{"id":"281317160_SATGraf_Visualizing_the_Evolution_of_SAT_Formula_Structure_in_Solvers","abstract":"In this paper, we present SATGraf, a tool for visualizing the\nevolution of the structure of a Boolean SAT formula in real time as it is be-\ning processed by a conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) solver. The tool\nis parametric, allowing the user to define the structure to be visualized.\nIn particular, the tool can visualize the community structure of real-world\nBoolean satisfiability (SAT) instances and their evolution during solving.\nSuch visualizations have been the inspiration for several hypotheses about\nthe connection between community structure and the running time of CDCL\nSAT solvers, some which we have already empirically verified. SATGraf has\nenabled us in making the following empirical observations regarding CDCL\nsolvers: First, we observe that the Variable State Independent Decaying Sum\n(VSIDS) branching heuristic consistently chooses variables with a high num-\nber of inter-community edges, i.e., high-centrality bridge variables. Second,\nwe observe that the VSIDS branching heuristic and hence the CDCL search\nprocedure is highly focused, i.e., VSIDS disproportionately picks variables\nfrom a few communities in the community-structure of input SAT formulas.","authors":["Zack Newsham","William Lindsay","Vijay Ganesh","Jia Hui Liang"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24318-4_6","Conference: 18th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability TestingAt: Austin, Texas"],"references":["266859239_Impact_of_Community_Structure_on_SAT_Solver_Performance","262354532_iSat_Structure_Visualization_for_SAT_Problems","262277579_Online_Community_Detection_for_Large_Complex_Networks","262209710_The_Community_Structure_of_SAT_Formulas","242355944_Feature-oriented_domain_analysis_foda_feasibility_study_cmusei-90-tr-21","228943311_Minisat_v113-a_SAT_solver_with_conflict-clause_minimization","221062367_Symbolic_Model_Checking_Using_SAT_Procedures_instead_of_BDDs","220944475_SAT_Based_Predicate_Abstraction_for_Hardware_Verification","246175302_Feature_Oriented_Design_Analysis_FODA_Feasibility_Study","220944624_DPVIS_-_A_tool_to_visualize_the_structure_of_SAT_instances"]}
