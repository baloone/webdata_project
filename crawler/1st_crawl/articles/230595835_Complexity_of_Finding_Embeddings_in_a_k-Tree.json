{"id":"230595835_Complexity_of_Finding_Embeddings_in_a_k-Tree","abstract":"We address the problem of determining whether a graph is a partial k- tree. We determine the complexity status of two problems related to finding the smallest number k such that a given graph is a partial k- tree. First, finding the minimum such value in NP-hard (the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete). Second, for a fixed (predetermined) value of k, a dynamic programming approach gives algorithms with polynomially bounded (but exponential in k) worst case time complexity. Previously, this problem had only been solved for k=1,2,3.","authors":["Stefan Arnborg","Derek G.
