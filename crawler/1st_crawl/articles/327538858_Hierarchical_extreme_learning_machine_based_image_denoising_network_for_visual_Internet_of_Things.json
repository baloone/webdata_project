{"id":"327538858_Hierarchical_extreme_learning_machine_based_image_denoising_network_for_visual_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"In the visual Internet of Things (VIoT), imaging sensors must achieve a balance between limited bandwidth and useful information when images contain heavy noise. In this paper, we address the problem of removing heavy noise and propose a novel hierarchical extreme learning machine-based image denoising network, which comprises a sparse auto-encoder and a supervised regression. Due to the fast training of a hierarchical extreme learning machine, an effective image denoising system that is robust for various noise levels can be trained more efficiently than other denoising methods, using a deep neural network. Our proposed framework also contains a non-local aggregation procedure that aims to fine-tune noise reduction according to structural similarity. Compared to the compression ratio in noisy images, the compression ratio of denoised images can be dramatically improved. Therefore, the method can achieve a low communication cost for data interactions in the VIoT. Experimental studies on images, including both hand-written digits and natural scenes, have demonstrated that the proposed technique achieves excellent performance in suppressing heavy noise. Further, it greatly reduces the training time, and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of denoising indexes for the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or the structural similarity index (SSIM).","authors":["Yifan Yang","Hong Zhang","Deshuai Yuan","Daniel Sun"],"meta":["September 2018Applied Soft Computing 74","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2018.08.046"],"references":["325696960_A_survey_on_application_of_machine_learning_for_Internet_of_Things","264984911_3D_Shape_Segmentation_and_Labeling_via_Extreme_Learning_Machine"]}
