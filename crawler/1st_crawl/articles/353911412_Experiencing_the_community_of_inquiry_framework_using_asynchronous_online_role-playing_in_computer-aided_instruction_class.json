{"id":"353911412_Experiencing_the_community_of_inquiry_framework_using_asynchronous_online_role-playing_in_computer-aided_instruction_class","abstract":"This current study investigates the use of online role-playing, in an online discussion forum, in learning the community of inquiry framework â€“ an area of learning covered in the Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) course, an elective course for Computer Science undergraduate students at Universitas Indonesia. The participants were divided into different roles. Each group was triggered to discuss the implementation of online collaborative learning. A mixed-methods approach was utilised to analyse the qualitative and quantitative data. The result of content analysis exhibited students implementing all the components of the CoI framework. Teaching presence was the rarest, as students were focused on delivering their ideas. Social presence appeared in almost all messages since it is the easiest, and students can feel the impact immediately. The discussion moved to the integration phase but did not proceed to resolution. This study suggested some recommendations and future research topics.","authors":["Kasiyah Junus","Harry B.
