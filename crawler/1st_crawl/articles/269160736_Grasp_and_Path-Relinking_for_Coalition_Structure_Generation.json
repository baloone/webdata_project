{"id":"269160736_Grasp_and_Path-Relinking_for_Coalition_Structure_Generation","abstract":"In Artificial Intelligence with Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) one refers to those\ncooperative complex problems that require to find an optimal partition (maximizing a social welfare)\nof a set of entities involved in a system. The solution of the CSG problem finds applications in many\nfields such as Machine Learning (set covering machines, clustering), Data Mining (decision tree,\ndiscretization), Graph Theory, Natural Language Processing (aggregation), Semantic Web (service\ncomposition), and Bioinformatics. The problem of finding the optimal coalition structure is NPcomplete.\nIn this paper we present a greedy adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with path-relinking\nto efficiently search the space of coalition structures. Experiments and comparisons to other algorithms\nprove the validity of the proposed method in solving this hard combinatorial problem.\nKeywords: Coalition Structure Generation, Stochastic-Local-Search, GRASP procedure, Path-\nRelinking","authors":["Nicola Di Mauro","Teresa M.A. Basile","Stefano Ferilli","Floriana Esposito"],"meta":["June 2014Fundamenta Informaticae 129(1):1-26","DOI:10.3233/FI-2014-870"],"references":["259743335_An_Anytime_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Coalition_Structure_Generation","228556948_Operations_ResearchComputer_Science_Interfaces_Series","226089570_Scatter_Search_and_Path-Relinking_Fundamentals_Advances_and_Applications","225237245_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedures","299112897_State-of-the-art_in_privacy_preserving_data_mining","243015461_Restricted_growth_functions_rank_row_matchings_of_partition_lattices_and_q-Stirling_numbers","238753447_Theories_of_Coalition_Formation","232708097_Bayesian_Heuristic_Approach_to_Discrete_and_Global_Optimization","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","222114786_Privacy-preserving_data_mining_A_feature_set_partitioning_approach"]}
