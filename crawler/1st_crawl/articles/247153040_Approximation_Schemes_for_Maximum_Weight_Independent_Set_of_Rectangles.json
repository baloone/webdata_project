{"id":"247153040_Approximation_Schemes_for_Maximum_Weight_Independent_Set_of_Rectangles","abstract":"In the Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles (MWISR) problem we are\ngiven a set of n axis-parallel rectangles in the 2D-plane, and the goal is to\nselect a maximum weight subset of pairwise non-overlapping rectangles. Due to\nmany applications, e.g. in data mining, map labeling and admission control, the\nproblem has received a lot of attention by various research communities. We\npresent the first (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the MWISR problem\nwith quasi-polynomial running time 2^{poly(log n/epsilon)}. In contrast, the\nbest known polynomial time approximation algorithms for the problem achieve\nsuperconstant approximation ratios of O(log log n) (unweighted case) and O(log\nn / log log n) (weighted case).\nKey to our results is a new geometric dynamic program which recursively\nsubdivides the plane into polygons of bounded complexity. We provide the\ntechnical tools that are needed to analyze its performance. In particular, we\npresent a method of partitioning the plane into small and simple areas such\nthat the rectangles of an optimal solution are intersected in a very controlled\nmanner. Together with a novel application of the weighted planar graph\nseparator theorem due to Arora et al. this allows us to upper bound our\napproximation ratio by (1+epsilon).\nOur dynamic program is very general and we believe that it will be useful for\nother settings. In particular, we show that, when parametrized properly, it\nprovides a polynomial time (1+epsilon)-approximation for the special case of\nthe MWISR problem when each rectangle is relatively large in at least one\ndimension. Key to this analysis is a method to tile the plane in order to\napproximately describe the topology of these rectangles in an optimal solution.\nThis technique might be a useful insight to design better polynomial time\napproximation algorithms or even a PTAS for the MWISR problem.","authors":["Anna Adamaszek","Andreas Wiese"],"meta":["July 2013Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2013.50","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228057537_A_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_Weighted_Planar_Graph_TSP","222668936_Fast_Stabbing_of_Boxes_in_High_Dimensions","220779052_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Rectangles","3686688_Clustering_association_rules","2626179_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Rectangle_Tiling_and_Packing_Extended_Abstract","259233731_The_High-Resolution_OTF_Survey_of_the_12CO_in_M31","223393468_Finding_the_connected_component_and_a_maximum_clique_of_an_intersection_graph_of_rectangles_in_the_plane","221462793_Coloring_and_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Rectangles","221462654_Routing_and_Admission_Control_in_Networks_with_Advance_Reservations","221209564_Independent_Set_of_Intersection_Graphs_of_Convex_Objects_in_2D","220780124_Computing_the_Independence_Number_of_Intersection_Graphs","220616707_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Geometric_Intersection_Graphs","220422204_A_Rule-Based_System_for_Dense-Map_Name_Placement","220406923_Efficient_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Tiling_and_Packing_Problems_with_Rectangles","220225521_Data_Mining_with_Optimized_Two-Dimensional_Association_Rules","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","220115208_A_note_on_maximum_independent_sets_in_rectangle_intersection_graphs","220113547_Optimal_Packing_and_Covering_in_the_Plane_are_NP-Complete","50305747_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Pseudo-Disks","48209334_A_Constant_Factor_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Unsplittable_Flow_on_Paths","2868897_On_Approximating_Rectangle_Tiling_and_Packing","2533046_Label_Placement_by_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Rectangles"]}
