{"id":"4254424_Closing_the_Loop_in_Water_Supply_Optimisation","abstract":"Implementation of sophisticated SCADA systems in the water industry has given plant operators unprecedented capability to monitor and control all aspects of water production and distribution from a centralized control centre. Sophisticated utilities recognize that SCADA need not be composed of one or more isolated \"islands of automation \" but can and should be a single system operating on a wide area network, and integrated into their enterprise wide information technology system. The next logical step following implementation of a SCADA system is to leverage off this investment using state of the art software to allow predictive as opposed to reactive control of the water system. Resulting benefits can include improving water quality through reduced water age, minimizing energy costs and improved system operations without compromising operational reliability. This paper present a selected number of case histories from the US where innovative optimisation software has significantly improved operation and achieved rapid pay-back through energy cost savings.","authors":["S.
