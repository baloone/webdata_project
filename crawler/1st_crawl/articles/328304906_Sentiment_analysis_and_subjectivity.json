{"id":"328304906_Sentiment_analysis_and_subjectivity","abstract":"Textual information in the world can be broadly categorized into two main types: facts and opinions. Facts are objective expressions about entities, events, and their properties. Opinions are usually subjective expressions that describe people’s sentiments, appraisals, or feelings toward entities, events, and their properties. The concept of opinion is very broad. In this chapter, we only focus on opinion expressions that convey people’s positive or negative sentiments. Much of the existing research on textual information processing has been focused on themining and retrieval of factual information, e.g., information retrieval (IR), Web search, text classification, text clustering, and many other text mining and natural language processing tasks. Littleworkhadbeendone on the processing of opinions until only recently. Yet, opinions are so important that whenever we need to make a decision we want to hear others’ opinions. This is not only true for individuals but also true for organizations.","authors":["B. Liu"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":[]}
