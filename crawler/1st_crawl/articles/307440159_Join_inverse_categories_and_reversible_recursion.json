{"id":"307440159_Join_inverse_categories_and_reversible_recursion","abstract":"Recently, a number of reversible functional programming languages have been proposed. Common to several of these is the assumption of totality, a property that is not necessarily desirable, and certainly not required in order to guarantee reversibility. In a categorical setting, however, faithfully capturing partiality requires handling it as additional structure. Recently, Giles studied inverse categories as a model of partial reversible (functional) programming. In this paper, we show how additionally assuming the existence of countable joins on such inverse categories leads to a number of properties that are desirable when modelling reversible functional programming, notably morphism schemes for reversible recursion, a †-trace, and algebraic ω-compactness. This gives a categorical account of reversible recursion, and, for the latter, provides an answer to the problem posed by Giles regarding the formulation of recursive data types at the inverse category level.","authors":["Robin Kaarsgaard","Holger Bock Axelsen","Robert Glück"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 87(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.08.003"],"references":["300780492_Towards_a_Domain-Specific_Language_for_Reversible_Assembly_Sequences","281545061_Reverse_Code_Generation_for_Parallel_Discrete_Event_Simulation","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","260401535_Dagger_Traced_Symmetric_Monoidal_Categories_and_Reversible_Programming","259824275_Retracing_some_paths_in_Process_Algebra","257643485_A_Representation_Theorem_for_Unique_Decomposition_Categories","235541808_On_the_functor_l2","231966472_Traced_monoidal_categories","222648494_Idempotents_in_Dagger_Categories_Extended_Abstract","221570109_What_Do_Reversible_Programs_Compute","220997850_Information_Effects","220173613_Geometry_of_Interaction_and_Linear_Combinatory_Algebras","2132132_Restriction_categories_III_Colimits_partial_limits_and_extensivity","313426539_Coherence_for_distributivity","309091499_Computing_with_Semirings_and_Weak_Rig_Groupoids","309091498_Join_Inverse_Categories_as_Models_of_Reversible_Recursion","300545064_Reversible_Limited_Automata","282563974_Fundamentals_of_reversible_flowchart_languages","266940084_Inverse_categories","261861460_Towards_a_Reversible_Functional_Language","242795663_Recursive_Data_Types_in_Algebraically_o-Complete_Categories","233764059_Restriction_categories_as_enriched_categories","230570071_Finite_dimensional_Hilbert_spaces_are_complete_for_dagger_compact_closedcategories","227072499_The_inverse_semigroup_of_a_sum-ordered_semiring","226418586_Conservative_Logic","225214774_Coherence_for_distributivity","225174035_Principles_of_Inverse_Computation_and_the_Universal_Resolving_Algorithm","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","223190031_Restriction_categories_II_Partial_map_classification","222691643_Restriction_categories_I_Categories_of_partial_maps","222470308_Algebraically_compact_functors","222027571_Categories_of_Partial_Maps","221323272_A_Program_Inverter_for_a_Functional_Language_with_Equality_and_Constructors","221278463_Derivation_of_Deterministic_Inverse_Programs_Based_on_LR_Parsing","220989929_A_reversible_programming_language_and_its_invertible_self-interpreter","220443533_Two-Way_Reversible_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata","220104036_Robust_and_reversible_execution_of_self-reconfiguration_sequences","45868699_A_Survey_of_Graphical_Languages_for_Monoidal_Categories","2756358_Recursion_from_Cyclic_Sharing_Traced_Monoidal_Categories_and_Models_of_Cyclic_Lambda_Calculi"]}
