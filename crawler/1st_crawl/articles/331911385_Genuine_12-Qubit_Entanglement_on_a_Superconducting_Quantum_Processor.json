{"id":"331911385_Genuine_12-Qubit_Entanglement_on_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Processor","abstract":"We report the preparation and verification of a genuine 12-qubit entanglement in a superconducting processor. The processor that we designed and fabricated has qubits lying on a 1D chain with relaxation times ranging from 29.6 to 54.6 μs. The fidelity of the 12-qubit entanglement was measured to be above 0.5544±0.0025, exceeding the genuine multipartite entanglement threshold by 21 statistical standard deviations. After thermal cycling, the 12-qubit state fidelity was further improved to be above 0.707±0.008. Our entangling circuit to generate linear cluster states is depth invariant in the number of qubits and uses single- and double-qubit gates instead of collective interactions. Our results are a substantial step towards large-scale random circuit sampling and scalable measurement-based quantum computing.","authors":["Ming Gong","Ming-cheng Chen","Zheng Yarui","Shiyu Wang"],"meta":["March 2019Physical Review Letters 122(11)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.110501"],"references":["322498402_18-qubit_entanglement_with_photon's_three_degrees_of_freedom","322418795_16-qubit_IBM_universal_quantum_computer_can_be_fully_entangled","321417396_Observation_of_Entangled_States_of_a_Fully_Controlled_20-Qubit_System","318898913_Observation_of_a_Many-Body_Dynamical_Phase_Transition_with_a_53-Qubit_Quantum_Simulator","318460833_Probing_many-body_dynamics_on_a_51-atom_quantum_simulator","315710430_10-Qubit_Entanglement_and_Parallel_Logic_Operations_with_a_Superconducting_Circuit","305780465_Characterizing_Quantum_Supremacy_in_Near-Term_Devices","326399373_Phase_transitions_in_a_programmable_quantum_spin_glass_simulator","315454606_Solving_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_with_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Processor","263019816_Testing_foundations_of_quantum_mechanics_with_photons"]}
