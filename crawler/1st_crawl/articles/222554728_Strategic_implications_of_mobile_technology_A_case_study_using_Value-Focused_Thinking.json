{"id":"222554728_Strategic_implications_of_mobile_technology_A_case_study_using_Value-Focused_Thinking","abstract":"Mobile technology extends computing and the Internet into the wireless medium, and provides greater flexibility in communication, collaboration, and information sharing. In this research, we used the ‘Value-Focused Thinking’ approach to examine the strategic implications of mobile technology in a leading publishing company. The result is a means-ends objective network that depicts the fundamental objectives of using mobile technology and how the fundamental objectives can be achieved through means objectives. The research findings suggest three main strategic implications of mobile technology: (1) improve working process; (2) increase internal communication and knowledge sharing; and (3) enhance sales and marketing effectiveness.","authors":["Hong Sheng","Fiona Fui-Hoon Nah","Keng Siau"],"meta":["September 2005The Journal of Strategic Information Systems 14(3):269-290","DOI:10.1016/j.jsis.2005.07.004"],"references":["304199284_Half_condensed_domains","262240788_Developing_Foundation_for_Strategy_at_Seagate_Software","250889813_Mobile_Organizing_Using_Information_Technology_MOBIT","248504446_Development_of_a_Framework_for_Trust_in_Mobile_Commerce","248296214_Value-Focused_Thinking_About_Strategic_Decisions_at_BC_Hydro","222704367_The_Mobile_Commerce_Value_Chain_Analysis_and_Future_Developments","222559379_eAirlines_Strategic_and_tactical_use_of_ICTs_in_the_airline_industry","220892366_Value_of_Mobile_Commerce_to_Customers","220591367_Considering_Social_Subsystem_Costs_and_Benefits_in_Information_Technology_Investment_Decisions_A_View_from_the_Field_on_Anticipated_Payoffs","220426193_Emerging_Business_Models_for_Mobile_Brokerage_Services","220425927_Building_customer_trust_in_mobile_commerce","220425077_Mobile_Banking_Services","220423773_The_Productivity_Paradox_of_Information_Technology","220423359_Mobile_commerce_at_Crossroads","220422750_Emerging_Mobile_and_Wireless_Networks","220421017_Current_and_Future_Applications_of_Mobile_and_Wireless_Networks","220420776_The_Value_of_Mobile_Applications_A_Utility_Company_Study","220300541_A_qualitative_investigation_on_consumer_trust_in_mobile_commerce","220286343_Dealing_with_Mobility_Understanding_Access_Anytime_Anywhere","220260339_Data_Warehousing_Supports_Corporate_Strategy_At_First_American_Corporation","220260264_A_Resource-Based_Perspective_on_Information_Technology_Capability_and_Firm_Performance_An_Empirical_Investigation","292659307_What_Else_Bears_Watching","274754127_Information_Technology_Increasing_Productivity_in_Services","262207998_The_Value_of_Internet_Commerce_to_the_Customer","262142507_How_Information_Gives_You_Competitive_Advantage","238622478_Success_Factors_and_Impacts_of_Mobile_Business_Applications_Results_From_A_Mobile_E-Procurement_Study1","237272517_Capabilities_Business_Processes_and_Competitive_Advantage_Choosing_the_Dependent_Variable_in_Empirical_Tests_of_the_Resource-Based_View","234781538_The_Diffusion_of_Electronic_Data_Interchange","228767068_Unwired_Business_Wireless_Applications_in_the_Firm's_Value_Chain","228141690_Strategic_Contributions_of_Information_Technology_An_Empirical_Study_of_Atm_Networks","227832972_So_How_Do_People_Really_Use_Their_Handheld_Devices_An_Interactive_Study_of_Wireless_Technology_Use","227447231_Information_Technology_Effects_on_Firm_Performance_as_Measured_by_Tobin's_Q","227446619_Development_of_Measures_to_Assess_the_Extent_to_Which_an_Information_Technology_Application_Provides_Competitive_Advantage","224952210_A_Review_of_Case_Study_Research_Design_and_Methods","223591397_IS-enabled_sustainable_competitive_advantage_in_financial_services_retailing_and_manufacturing","222668476_Strategic_use_of_the_Internet_and_e-commerce_Cisco_Systems","222516505_Using_a_Case_Study_to_Test_the_Role_of_Three_Key_Social_Enablers_in_ERP_Implementation","221600111_Value_Focused_Assessment_of_Individual_Privacy_Concerns_for_Internet_Commerce","221599020_Value-Focused_Assessment_of_Information_System_Security_in_Organizations","221598701_A_Process_Oriented_Framework_for_Assessing_the_Business_Value_of_Information_Technology","220591846_Strategic_Information_Systems_and_Financial_Performance","220591274_Information_Technology_Payoff_in_the_Health-Care_Industry_A_Longitudinal_Study","220591060_Measuring_the_Organizational_Impact_of_Information_Technology_Investment_An_Exploratory_Study","220500544_Realizing_the_Business_Value_of_Information_Technology_Investments_An_Organizational_Process","220427102_Wells_JD_Understanding_mobile_handheld_device_use_and_adoption_Commun_ACM_4612_35-40","220424731_Rethinking_the_value_of_IT_again","220422692_The_Information_System_as_a_Competitive_Weapon","220422226_The_new_productivity_paradox","220260174_Business_Value_of_Information_Technology_A_Study_of_Electronic_Data_Interchange","220260162_Review_Information_Technology_and_Organizational_Performance_An_Integrative_Model_of_IT_Business_Value","220260094_Productivity_Business_Profitability_and_Consumer_Surplus_Three_Different_Measures_of_Information_Technology_Value","220079928_Information_Technology_and_Corporate_Strategy_A_View_from_the_Top","220079743_Measuring_Factors_that_Influence_the_Success_of_Internet_Commerce","220259883_Issues_in_Linking_Information_Technology_Capability_to_Firm_Performance","220079503_Information_Technologies_and_Business_Value_An_Analytic_and_Empirical_Investigation"]}
