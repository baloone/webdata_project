{"id":"2494054_A_Technique_of_State_Space_Search_Based_on_Unfolding","abstract":"Unfoldings of Petri nets provide a method of searching the state space of concurrent systems without considering all possible interleavings of concurrent events. A procedure is given for constructing the unfolding of a Petri net, terminating the construction when it is sufficient to represent all reachable markings. This procedure is applied to hazard and deadlock detection in asynchronous circuits. Examples are given of scalable systems with exponential size state spaces, but polynomial size unfoldings, including a distributed mutual exclusion ring circuit.","authors":["K. L.
