{"id":"263370178_Complex_Self-Reproducing_Systems","abstract":"Cellular automata and L-Systems are well-known formal models to describe the behaviour of biological processes. They are discrete dynamical systems, each of which can have complex and varied behaviour. Here, we study a class of substitutive systems incorporating properties of both cellular automata and L-systems, that exhibits self-reproducing behaviour. A one-dimensional array of cells is considered, each cell has a set of modes or states which are determined by a number from \\(\\mathbb {Z}/\\mathbf{{n}}\\mathbb {Z}^*\\) (\\(n\\) prime). The behaviour of a cell depends on the states of its neighbours and obeys an additive rule. It has also a cell-division mode, which allows the line of cells to grow. The behaviour of such a model can be complex, but, using algebraic techniques, we prove that it can describe a reproducing system.","authors":["Aude Maignan"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-45438-7_7","Conference: ISCS 13"],"references":["329230353_Classification_of_Cellular_Automata_A_Volume_in_the_Encyclopedia_of_Complexity_and_Systems_Science_Second_Edition","312893521_Mathematical_models_for_cellular_interaction_in_development_parts_I_and_II","292383575_Cellular_automata_Classification_of","279235721_Mathematical_Models_for_Cellular_Interactions_in_Development_Parts_I_and_II","269880662_A_New_Kind_of_Science","265366084_Mathematical_biology_Vol_2_Spatial_models_and_biomedical_applications_3rd_revised_ed","253611150_Introduction_to_Modeling_for_Biosciences","247753191_The_Algorithmic_Beauty_of_Plants-The_Virtual_Laboratory","244960072_A_new_kind_of_science_Wolfram_Publishing","236577756_A_new_Kind_of_Science"]}
