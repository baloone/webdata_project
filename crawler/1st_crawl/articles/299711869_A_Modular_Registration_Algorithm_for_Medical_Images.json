{"id":"299711869_A_Modular_Registration_Algorithm_for_Medical_Images","abstract":"The aim of this communication is to present the design of a code for image registration based on a modular structure which allows to easily combine and interchange different image models, transformation classes and image “distance” functionals, which are dealt with by independent modules which can be implemented transparently to each other. The code is tested by comparing several registration strategies on medical images.","authors":["Silvia Bertoluzza","Giulia Maggi","Stefano Tomatis"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-39094-4_53","Conference: International Conference Image Analysis and Recognition"],"references":["13730405_Brain_abnormality_in_schizophrenia_A_systematic_and_quantitative_review_of_volumetric_magnetic_resonance_imaging_studies","2324157_Neuroanatomical_Segmentation_in_MRI_Technological_Objectives","2259646_Interpolating_Wavelet_Transform","224817392_On_Estimation_of_Probability_Density_Function_and_Mode","221988937_A_Wavelet_Collocation_Method_for_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Partial_Differential_Equations","221472489_A_Class_of_Image_Metrics_Based_on_the_Structural_Similarity_Quality_Index","14085167_Magnetic_resonance_imaging_MRI_Considerations_and_applications_in_radiotherapy_treatment_planning","5589110_Optimization_of_Mutual_Information_for_Multiresolution_Image_Registration"]}
