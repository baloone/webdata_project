{"id":"333105506_A_Data_Mining_Approach_on_Various_Classifiers_in_Email_Spam_Filtering","abstract":"E-mails are the most nontrivial means of communication in the recent years. Spam mails often cause inconvenient to the users. The mails are classified as Spam and ham. Unwanted mails are called as spam and genuine mails are called as ham. In this paper, the effective decision tree classifiers are used to classify whether the mail is spam or ham. Many filtering techniques are used to find the spam mails and filter them but the accuracy and performance of the algorithms is distinct from each other. Efficient filtering of spam mails is an important requirement in using the existing data mining algorithms. In this paper, six decision tree algorithms that are basically used as classifiers namely J48 or C4.5, Rndtree, BFtree, REPtree, LMT and simple CART are compared. These algorithms were studied, analyzed and test results are shown in WEKA tool for efficient spam filtering. The results are compared and RndTree algorithm shows almost 99% accuracy level in filtering the spam mails and this shows best results among other classifiers.","authors":["Mr C Balakumar","D Ganeshkumar","Ganeshkumar Deivasikamani"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.29525.47840"],"references":["290651051_Comparative_Study_on_Email_Spam_Classifier_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","220482991_An_Evaluation_of_Naive_Bayesian_Anti-Spam_Filtering","220017784_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","50235326_Email_Spam_Filtering_using_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Techniques","238740204_Data_Mining_Algorithms_for_Classification","33051652_Logistic_Model_Trees"]}
