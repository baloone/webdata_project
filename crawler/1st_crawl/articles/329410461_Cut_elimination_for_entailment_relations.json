{"id":"329410461_Cut_elimination_for_entailment_relations","abstract":"Entailment relations, introduced by Scott in the early 1970s, provide an abstract generalisation of Gentzenâ€™s multi-conclusion logical inference. Originally applied to the study of multi-valued logics, this notion has then found plenty of applications, ranging from computer science to abstract algebra. In particular, an entailment relation can be regarded as a constructive presentation of a distributive lattice and in this guise it has proven to be a useful tool for the constructive reformulation of several classical theorems in commutative algebra. In this paper, motivated by these concrete applications, we state and prove a cut-elimination result for inductively generated entailment relations. We analyse some of its consequences and describe the existing connections with analogous results in the literature.","authors":["Davide Rinaldi","Daniel Wessel"],"meta":["August 2019Archive for Mathematical Logic 58(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00153-018-0653-0"],"references":["283450703_The_Basic_Zariski_Topology","335440954_Ordering_groups_constructively","320512451_Eliminating_disjunctions_by_disjunction_elimination","317773817_ELIMINATING_DISJUNCTIONS_BY_DISJUNCTION_ELIMINATION","312521058_Lattice-ordered_groups_generated_by_ordered_groups_and_regular_systems_of_ideals","311842241_Extension_by_Conservation_Sikorski's_Theorem","297729578_A_universal_Krull-Lindenbaum_theorem","290096220_Intuitionistic_Formal_Spaces_-_A_First_Communication","281186433_Algebre_dynamique_espaces_topologiques_sans_points_et_programme_de_Hilbert","276001936_Multiple_Conclusion_Logic","275728925_On_Engendering_an_Illusion_of_Understanding","268658978_A_Sequent_Calculus_for_Constructive_Ordered_Fields","268244239_Heitmann_dimension_of_distributive_lattices_and_commutative_rings","267164992_Kreisel's_unwinding_of_Artin's_proof","266513002_Dynamical_algebraic_structures_pointfree_topological_spaces_and_Hilbert's_program_Structures_algebriques_dynamiques_espaces_topologiques_sans_points_et_programme_de_Hilbert"]}
