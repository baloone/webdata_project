{"id":"339293583_Small_Clues_Tell_a_Collaborative_Expansion_Approach_for_Effective_Content-Based_Recommendations","abstract":"Content-based recommendation techniques usually require a large number of training examples for model construction, which however may not always be available in many real-world scenarios. To address the training data availability constraint common to the content-based approach, we develop a collaborative expansion-based approach to expand the size of training examples, which could lead to improved content-based recommendations. We use a book rating data set collected from Amazon to evaluate our proposed method and compare its performance against those of two salient benchmark techniques. The results show that our method outperforms the benchmark techniques consistently and significantly. Our method expands the size of training examples for a focal customer by leveraging the available preferences of his or her referent group, and thereby better supports personalized recommendations than existing techniques that solely follow content-based or collaborative filtering, without incurring costs to identify, collect, and analyze additional information. This study reveals the value and feasibility of collaborative expansion as a viable means to increase training size for the focal customer and thus address the training data availability constraint that seriously hinders the performance of content-based recommender systems.","authors":["Yen-Hsien Lee","Chih-Ping Wei","Paul Jen-Hwa Hu","Tsang-Hsiang Cheng"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce 30(1):1-18","DOI:10.1080/10919392.2020.1718056"],"references":["318671349_Deep_Learning_Based_Recommender_System_A_Survey_and_New_Perspectives","313787463_A_Survey_on_Recommendation_System","280576923_Research-paper_recommender_systems_A_literature_survey","257641094_Kuukkeli-TV_Online_content-based_services_and_applications_for_broadcast_TV_with_long-term_user_experiments","247837002_Internet_Recommendation_Systems","226098747_Content-based_Recommender_Systems_State_of_the_Art_and_Trends","225268257_Scale_and_Translation_Invariant_Collaborative_Filtering_Systems","221604960_Thresholding_for_Making_Classifiers_Cost_Sensitive","221136182_Newshand_A_Semantic_Web_Approach_to_Recommending_News","220426798_Fab_Content-Based_Collaborative_Recommendation","220173171_A_Survey_of_Collaborative_Filtering_Techniques","4047552_Cost-Sensitive_Learning_by_Cost-Proportionate_Example_Weighting","2626981_Exploiting_the_Cost_Insensitivity_of_Decision_Tree_Splitting_Criteria","2552275_Partially_Supervised_Classification_of_Text_Documents","2434797_Analysis_of_Recommendation_Algorithms_for_E-Commerce","2363447_Committee_Machines","356282949_Document_representation_techniques_and_their_effect_on_the_document_Clustering_and_Classification_A_Review","324500759_Adapting_Topic_Map_and_Social_Influence_to_the_Personalized_Hybrid_Recommender_System","322067131_Positive_unlabeled_learning_for_building_recommender_systems_in_a_parliamentary_setting","317868449_Deep_Hybrid_Recommender_Systems_via_Exploiting_Document_Context_and_Statistics_of_Items","316801801_Recommender_Systems_for_Location-based_Social_Networks","316114128_Cost-Sensitive_Learning","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","310469669_Improving_the_accuracy_of_collaborative_filtering_recommendations_using_clustering_and_association_rules_mining_on_implicit_data","308733328_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Recommender_Systems","303715035_Locating_Experts_Using_Social_Media_Based_on_Social_Capital_and_Expertise_Similarity","301303141_A_Survey_on_Collaborative_Filtering_Based_Recommendation_System","296467757_A_Survey_on_Personalized_Service_Recommendation_Systems","290882608_Semantic_Information_Retrieval","285393706_Cost-Sensitive_Learning","283102074_Survey_on_recommendation_system_methods","275944774_Context_Similarity_Metric_for_Multidimensional_Service_Recommendation","275259530_Impact_of_Recommender_System_on_Competition_Between_Personalizing_and_Non-Personalizing_Firms","273159280_A_survey_on_context-aware_recommender_systems_based_on_computational_intelligence_techniques","262326071_Collaborative_Filtering_with_a_User-Item_Matrix_Reduction_Technique","262216448_A_hybrid_recommendation_approach_based_on_attributes_of_products_using_genetic_algorithm_and_naive_Bayes_classifier","259096795_A_survey_of_collaborative_filtering_based_social_recommender_systems","257160450_Semantic_audio_content-based_music_recommendation_and_visualization_based_on_user_preference_examples","228057919_Various_techniques_used_in_connection_with_random_digits","226582958_Content-Based_Recommendation_Services_for_Personalized_Digital_Libraries","222411375_Evaluating_feature_selection_methods_for_learning_in_data_mining_applications","221300972_An_algorithmic_framework_for_performing_collaborative_filtering","221140917_Knowledge_infusion_into_content-based_recommender_systems","221017948_Filtering_of_Web_Recommendation_Lists_Using_Positive_and_Negative_Usage_Patterns","220143874_Dynamic_Dissemination_of_Personalized_Content_on_the_Web","23738783_GroupLens_An_Open_Architecture_for_Collaborative_Filtering_of_Netnews","4368082_Using_decision_tree_and_association_rules_to_predict_cross_selling_opportunities","4133630_Test-Cost_Sensitive_Naive_Bayes_Classification","2492710_Content-Boosted_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Improved_Recommendations","2420356_Social_Information_Filtering_Algorithms_for_Automating_Word_of_Mouth"]}
