{"id":"222434550_Approximating_clique-width_and_branch-width","abstract":"We construct a polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the branch-width of certain symmetric submodular functions, and give two applications.The first is to graph “clique-width.” Clique-width is a measure of the difficulty of decomposing a graph in a kind of tree-structure, and if a graph has clique-width at most k then the corresponding decomposition of the graph is called a “k-expression.” We find (for fixed k) an O(n9logn)-time algorithm that, with input an n-vertex graph, outputs either a (23k+2−1)-expression for the graph, or a witness that the graph has clique-width at least k+1. (The best earlier algorithm, by Johansson [Ö. Johansson, logn-approximative NLCk-decomposition in O(n2k+1) time (extended abstract), in: Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science, Boltenhagen, 2001, in: Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., vol. 2204, Springer, Berlin, 2001, pp. 229–240], constructs a 2klogn-expression for graphs of clique-width at most k.) It was already known that several graph problems, NP-hard on general graphs, are solvable in polynomial time if the input graph comes equipped with a k-expression (for fixed k). As a consequence of our algorithm, the same conclusion follows under the weaker hypothesis that the input graph has clique-width at most k (thus, we no longer need to be provided with an explicit k-expression).Another application is to the area of matroid branch-width. For fixed k, we find an O(n3.5)-time algorithm that, with input an n-element matroid in terms of its rank oracle, either outputs a branch-decomposition of width at most 3k−1 or a witness that the matroid has branch-width at least k+1. The previous algorithm by Hliněný [P. Hliněný, A parametrized algorithm for matroid branch-width, SIAM J. Comput. 35 (2) (2005) 259–277] works only for matroids represented over a finite field.","authors":["Sang-il Oum","Paul Seymour"],"meta":["July 2006Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 96(4):514-528","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2005.10.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","220752609_The_Tree-Width_of_Clique-Width_Bounded_Graphs_Without_K_nn","220617851_A_Parametrized_Algorithm_for_Matroid_Branch-Width","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","2929241_Deciding_Clique-Width_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Tree-Width","2795827_A_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Finding","2376092_Parameterized_Complexity","317096017_How_to_solve_NP-hard_graph_problems_on_clique-width_bounded_graphs_in_polynomial_time","304823127_Deciding_clique-width_for_graphs_of_bounded_tree-width","281353873_Polynomial_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_3_Graphs","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","269546011_A_Decomposition","265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","265331769_Matroid_theory_AMS-IMS-SIAM_joint_summer_research_conference_on_matroid_theory_July_2-6_1995_University_of_Washington_Seattle_WA_USA","257650158_Parameterized_Complexity","248158816_Tree_width_and_tangles_A_new_connectivity_measure_and_some_applications","239544537_Matrices_and_Matroids_for_Systems_Analysis","229226379_A_decomposition_theory_for_matroids_I_General_results","226770465_log_n-Approximative_NLCk-Decomposition_in_On2k1_Time","225573312_On_the_Relationship_between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","225151584_Polynomial_Time_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_3_Graphs","223529096_Edge_dominating_set_and_colorings_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","222509237_Graph_minors_V_Excluding_a_planar_graph","222453029_k-NLC_graphs_and_polynomial_algorithms","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","221591477_A_Combinatorial_Strongly_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions","220980376_Polynomial_Time_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_le_leq_3_Graphs_Extended_Abstract","220752980_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220713201_The_Expression_of_Graph_Properties_and_Graph_Transformations_in_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic","220691518_Matroid_Decomposition","220618480_Cunningham_WH_Improved_bounds_for_matroid_partition_and_intersection_algorithms_SIAM_J_Comput_15_948-957","220618462_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220616628_A_Linear_Recognition_Algorithm_for_Cographs","220430827_A_combinatorial_strongly_polynomial_algorithm_for_minimizing_submodular_functions","220076537_Graph_minors_X_Obstructions_to_tree-decomposition","2452873_The_Expression_Of_Graph_Properties_And_Graph_Transformations_In_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic","2388721_How_to_Solve_NP-hard_Graph_Problems_on_Clique-Width_Bounded_Graphs_in_Polynomial_Time"]}
