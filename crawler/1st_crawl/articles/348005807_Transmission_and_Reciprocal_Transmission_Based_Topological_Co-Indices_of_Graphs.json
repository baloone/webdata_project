{"id":"348005807_Transmission_and_Reciprocal_Transmission_Based_Topological_Co-Indices_of_Graphs","abstract":"The transmission of a vertex u in a connected graph G is defined as the sum of thedistances between u and all other vertices of a graph G. The reciprocal transmission of a vertex u in a connected graph G is defined as the sum of the reciprocal of distances between u and all other vertices of a graph G. In this paper, we introduce and study new topological co-indices based on the transmission and reciprocal transmission of a vertex, such as transmission and reciprocal transmission sum-connectivity co-indices, transmission and reciprocal transmission atom bond connectivity co-indices, transmission and reciprocal transmission geometric-arithmetic co-indices, transmission and reciprocal transmission augmented Zagreb co-indices, and transmission and reciprocal transmission arithmetic-geometric co-indices. Further we obtain general formulae for some graphs.","authors":["Harishchandra S. Ramane","Saroja Y.
