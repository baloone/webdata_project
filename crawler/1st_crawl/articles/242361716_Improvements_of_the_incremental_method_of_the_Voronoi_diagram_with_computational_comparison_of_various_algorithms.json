{"id":"242361716_Improvements_of_the_incremental_method_of_the_Voronoi_diagram_with_computational_comparison_of_various_algorithms","abstract":"A fast algorithm for the Voronoi diagram is proposed along with the performance evaluation by extensive computational experiments. It is shown that the proposed algorithm runs in linear time on the average. The algorithm is of incremental type, which modifies the diagram step by step by adding points (generators) one by one. What is new is a special preprocessing procedure for determining the order in which the generators are to be added, where we make use of a quaternary tree combined with an elaborate technique of \"bucketing\".","authors":["Takao Ohya","Masao Iri","Kazuo Murota"],"meta":["January 1984Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan 27(4)","DOI:10.15807/jorsj.27.306"],"references":["220617051_Generalization_of_Voronoi_Diagrams_in_the_Plane","4354716_Applications_of_a_Planar_Separator_Theorem"]}
