{"id":"223710606_A_note_on_the_determinant_and_permanent_problem","abstract":"In Valiant's theory of arithmetic complexity, the following question occupies a central position: Given an integer n, what is the minimal m such that the permanent of an n × n matrix is the projection of the determinant of an m × m matrix? More generally, for affine linear transformations, we ask the similar question: what is the minimal m such that the permanent of an n × n matrix is the determinant of an m × m matrix via affine linear transformation? This paper gives the lower bound , for affine linear transformations. The result is an improvement of earlier results by von zur Gathen, Babai, and Seress. It also generalizes a classical theorem of Marcus and Minc.","authors":["Jin-yi Cai"],"meta":["January 1990Information and Computation 84(1):119-127","DOI:10.1016/0890-5401(90)90036-H","SourceDBLP"],"references":["227318124_Pfaffian_orientations_01_permanents_and_even_cycles_in_directed_graphs","288233542_Losung_zu_Aufgabe_424","274521455_Introduction_to_Commutative_Algebra","256105519_The_solution_of_Van_der_Waerden's_problem_for_permanents","254208911_On_the_relation_between_the_determinant_and_the_permanent","242378278_Reducibility_by_algebraic_projections","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222436692_Permanent_and_determinant","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra"]}
