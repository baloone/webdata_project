{"id":"241703545_Successful_ISO_9000_implementation_in_Taiwan_How_can_we_achieve_it_and_what_does_it_mean","abstract":"Purpose – This study aims to examine empirically how business in Taiwan has successfully implemented and benefited from ISO 9000. Design/methodology/approach – Of 1,668 survey questionnaires mailed to companies with ISO 9000 certification, a total of 441 usable responses were used in the survey. Using the structural equation model, this study is grounded in a theoretical framework that links five key variables: top management support, quality planning, employee involvement, continuous improvement and firm performance. Findings – The empirical results indicate that there is a positive relation between ISO 9000 and business performance. Keys to success include four constructs, namely top management support, quality planning, employee involvement and continuous improvement. These constructs are a series of chain, rather than parallel components. Originality/value – This study constructs a conceptual framework that links the following key variables: top management support, quality planning, employee involvement, continuous improvement and firm performance. This study not only assesses the impact of these practices on firm performance, but also clarifies the process through which ISO 9000 implementation effects performance. Moreover, it provides an empirical framework for testing the well-known PDCA cycle. The results should provide valuable information for dealing with similar managerial issues.","authors":["Ching-I Lin","Woan-Yuh Jang"],"meta":["October 2008International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management 57(8):600-622","DOI:10.1108/17410400810916044"],"references":["254452811_Implementation_of_ISO_9000_in_a_textile_mill","242021203_Impact_of_ISO_9000_registration_on_company_performance_Evidence_from_Malaysia","236145794_ISO_9000_certification_benefits_reality_or_myth","236145743_ISO_9000_certification_and_the_bottom_line_A_comparative_study_of_the_profitability_of_Basque_region_companies","235321761_Analysing_employee_attitudes_towards_ISO_certification","235297244_Has_ISO_9000_lost_some_of_its_lustre_A_longitudinal_impact_study","235275567_Analysis_of_the_implementation_of_ISO_9000_quality_assurance_systems","344599663_Quality_management_re-visited_a_reflective_review_and_agenda_for_future_research","321197896_Structural_equation_modeling_with_LISREL_PRELIS_and_SIMPLIS_Basic_concepts_applications_and_programming","315716627_The_use_of_LISREL_in_validating_marketing_construct","312656883_ISO_9000_and_total_quality","296089508_Future_necessity","290861477_Strategic_factors_associated_with_market_and_financial_performance","288727300_ISO_9000_International_quality_standards","284778046_Quality-Driven_Change_and_its_Effects_on_Financial_Performance","281545394_Implementing_the_ISO_9000_standards_in_Belgium","277500121_The_true_motives_behind_ISO_9000_certification","275246461_Facing_Up_to_the_Need_for_a_Management_Revolution","271789924_The_Strategic_Role_of_Product_Quality","268925626_The_Leaders'_New_Work_Building_Learning_Organizations","268395514_Representing_and_Testing_Organizational_Theories_A_Holistic_Construal","263542097_Total_Quality_Management","260845775_Total_Quality_Control","254659816_Product_Quality_Cost_Position_and_Business_Performance_A_Test_of_Some_Key_Hypotheses","247618577_Preparing_an_enterprise_for_ISO_9000_certification","247507933_Life_after_ISO_9000_An_analysis_of_the_impact_of_ISO_9000_and_total_quality_management_on_small_businesses_in_Northern_Ireland","247507889_An_empirical_study_on_quality_management_practices_in_Shangai_manufacturing_industries","247507678_A_study_of_ISO_9000_process_motivation_and_performance","247494845_Measuring_the_relative_efficiency_of_a_firm's_ability_to_achieve_organizational_benefits_after_ISO_certification","247453302_Scientific_Method_The_Generation_of_Knowledge_and_Quality","246557852_ISO9000_Quality_Systems_Auditor''s_Handbook","244094349_The_critical_maintenance_issues_of_the_ISO_9000_system_Hong_Kong_manufacturing_industries'_perspective","243710134_Is_the_ISO_9000_series_for_total_quality_management","242529382_What_is_Total_Quality_Control_The_Japanese_Way","242348779_Quality_management_results_in_ISO_9000_certified_Spanish_firms","242339526_Factors_influencing_a_successful_transition_from_ISO_9000_to_TQM","242004431_A_case_study_of_a_quality_system_implementation_in_a_small_manufacturing_firm","241702048_The_role_of_performance_measurement_systems_in_promoting_quality_development_beyond_ISO_9000","240238261_ISO_9000_certification_in_Indian_industries_A_survey","238655774_Consequences_of_Quality_Circles_in_an_Industrial_Setting_A_Longitudinal_Assessment","238294069_A_Replication_Study_of_a_Theory_of_Quality_Management_Underlying_the_Deming_Management_Method_Insights_from_an_Italian_Context","235361651_An_Updated_Paradigm_for_Scale_Development_Incorporating_Unidimensionality_and_Its_Assessment","235361368_A_Paradigm_For_Developing_Better_Measures_Of_Marketing_Constructs","235321442_The_implementation_of_an_ISO_9000_quality_system","235318787_An_integrated_framework_for_post-ISO_9000_quality_development","235317210_From_Quality_Circles_to_Total_Quality","235317208_Quality-Strategy_and_Quality-Management_Connections","235307868_ISO_9000_in_the_Low_Countries_reaching_for_new_heights","235305342_Smaller_Enterprises'_Experiences_with_ISO_9000","235294767_A_Review_of_the_Issues_Involved_in_Quality_Improvement","235255451_Benefits_of_ISO_9000_implementation_in_Spanish_industry","235272915_Are_the_cultures_required_to_attain_ISO_9000_and_total_quality_management_mutually_exclusive","235265486_BS_5750ISO_9000_-_The_experience_of_small_and_medium-sized_firms","235263764_Experiences_of_implementing_ISO_9000_in_Swedish_industry","234021554_Mutivariate_Data_Analysis"]}
