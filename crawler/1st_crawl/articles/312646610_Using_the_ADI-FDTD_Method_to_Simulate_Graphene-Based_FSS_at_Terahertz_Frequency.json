{"id":"312646610_Using_the_ADI-FDTD_Method_to_Simulate_Graphene-Based_FSS_at_Terahertz_Frequency","abstract":"The alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method is modified to simulate a graphene-based frequency selective surface. By using the auxiliary differential equation and Pade fitting method, both the interband and intraband conductivity of the graphene are incorporated into the ADI-FDTD method. The ADI-FDTD method has excellent computational accuracy and its computational efficiency is considerably improved from that of the conventional FDTD method. By using the proposed ADI-FDTD method, a graphene-based frequency selective surface is simulated and analyzed at terahertz frequency. The numerical results show that the graphene can achieve a tunable frequency selective surface through controlling its chemical potential, and the interband conductivity of the graphene has important effect on the performance of the frequency selective surface.","authors":["Juan Chen","Guocheng Hao","Qing Huo Liu"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility PP(99):1-6","DOI:10.1109/TEMC.2017.2650226","Project: Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) and Related Time Domain Methods"],"references":["232735510_Reconfigurable_THz_Plasmonic_Antenna_Concept_Using_a_Graphene_Stack","224455422_Dyadic_Green's_Functions_and_Guided_Surface_Waves_for_a_Surface_Conductivity_Model_of_Graphene","224141533_Terahertz_antenna_based_on_graphene","3166366_Truncation_of_open_boundaries_of_cylindrical_waveguides_in_25-dimensional_problems_by_using_the_convolutional_perfectly_matched_layer","304530719_Three-dimensional_dispersive_hybrid_implicit-explicit_finite-difference_time-domain_method_for_simulations_of_graphene","303890406_Finite-Difference_Time-Domain_Analysis_of_the_Shielding_Effectiveness_of_Metallic_Enclosures_With_Apertures_Using_a_Novel_Subgridding_Algorithm","301571706_Using_Dispersion_HIE-FDTD_method_to_Simulate_the_Graphene-Based_Polarizer","291557234_An_Improved_Circuit_Model_for_the_Prediction_of_the_Shielding_Effectiveness_and_Resonances_of_an_Enclosure_With_Apertures","289614340_Convolutional_Perfectly_Matched_Layer_CPML_for_the_Pseudospectral_Time-Domain_PSTD_Method","265470130_Broadband_modeling_surface_plasmon_polaritons_in_optically_pumped_and_curved_graphene_structures_with_an_improved_leapfrog_ADI-FDTD_method","264564230_An_FDTD_Model_of_Graphene_Intraband_Conductivity","260720798_Matrix_Exponential_FDTD_Modeling_of_Magnetized_Graphene_Sheet","260332186_Efficient_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Graphene_Devices_With_the_LOD-FDTD_Method","257970811_Non-contact_characterization_of_graphene_surface_impedance_at_micro_and_millimeter_waves","255796862_Analysis_and_design_of_terahertz_antennas_based_on_plasmonic_resonant_graphene_sheets","254062293_Optimal_Modeling_of_Infinite_Graphene_Sheets_via_a_Class_of_Generalized_FDTD_Schemes","254057594_Gyrotropy_and_Nonreciprocity_of_Graphene_for_Microwave_Applications","234939699_110_GHz_measurement_of_large-area_graphene_integrated_in_low-loss_microwave_structures","233742389_A_Perfectly_Matched_Layer_for_Sub-cell_FDTD_and_Applications_to_the_Modeling_of_Graphene_Structures","215490240_Numerical_Solution_of_Initial_Boundary_Value_Problem_Involving_Maxwell's_Equations_in_Isotropic_Media","3058424_A_Three-Dimensional_Semi-Implicit_FDTD_Scheme_for_Calculation_of_Shielding_Effectiveness_of_Enclosure_With_Thin_Slots","3056904_Feature_Selective_Validation_FSV_for_Validation_of_Computational_Electromagnetics_CEM_Part_II-_Assessment_of_FSV_Performance","3056903_Feature_Selective_Validation_FSV_for_Validation_of_Computational_Electromagnetics_CEM_Part_I-The_FSV_Method"]}
