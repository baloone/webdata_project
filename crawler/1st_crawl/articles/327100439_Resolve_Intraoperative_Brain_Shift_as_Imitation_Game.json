{"id":"327100439_Resolve_Intraoperative_Brain_Shift_as_Imitation_Game","abstract":"Soft tissue deformation induced by craniotomy and tissue manipulation brainshift limits the use of preoperative image overlay in an image-guided neurosurgery, and therefore reduces the accuracy of the surgery as a consequence. An inexpensive modality to compensate for the brain shift in real-time is Ultrasound (US). The core subject of research in this context is the non-rigid registration of preoperative MR and intraoperative US images. In this work, we propose a learning based approach to address this challenge. Resolving intraoperative brain shift is considered as an imitation game, where the optimal action (displacement) for each landmark on MR is trained with a multi-task network. The result shows a mean target error of 1.21 +- 0.55 mm.","authors":["Xia Zhong","Siming Bayer","Nishant Ravikumar","Norbert Strobel"],"meta":["September 2018","Conference: CuRIOUS challenge MICCAI 2018At: Granada, Spain"],"references":["317353514_Intraoperative_Imaging_Modalities_and_Compensation_for_Brain_Shift_in_Tumor_Resection_Surgery","315844905_REtroSpective_Evaluation_of_Cerebral_Tumors_RESECT_A_clinical_database_of_pre-operative_MRI_and_intra-operative_ultrasound_in_low-grade_glioma_surgeries","311411614_PointNet_Deep_Learning_on_Point_Sets_for_3D_Classification_and_Segmentation","301648615_End_to_End_Learning_for_Self-Driving_Cars","221401996_Vessel_Driven_Correction_of_Brain_Shift","328723323_On_the_convergence_of_Adam_Beyond","319462055_Robust_Non-rigid_Registration_Through_Agent-Based_Action_Learning","312896266_Automatic_non-linear_MRI-ultrasound_registration_for_the_correction_of_intra-operative_brain_deformations","265969981_Automatic_Deformable_MR-Ultrasound_Registration_for_Image-Guided_Neurosurgery","222219268_A_survey_of_robot_learning_from_demonstration"]}
