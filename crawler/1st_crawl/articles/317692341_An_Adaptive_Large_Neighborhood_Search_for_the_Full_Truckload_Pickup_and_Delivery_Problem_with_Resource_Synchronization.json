{"id":"317692341_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Full_Truckload_Pickup_and_Delivery_Problem_with_Resource_Synchronization","abstract":"This paper presents the Full Truckload Pickup and Delivery Problem with Resource Synchronization (FT-PDP-RS). It consists of optimizing the transport of materials between sites, using a heterogeneous fleet of trucks, in the context of public works. Full truckload pickup and delivery requests have to be served within time windows. Trucks are synchronized on pickup or delivery locations based on unitary loading and unloading resources. We propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to solve this problem. Custom destroy and repair operators and an efficient feasibility insertion procedure have been designed to solve it. The method has been evaluated on real instances from the literature and on real case instances from a public works company. Computational experiments confirm the efficiency of the method.","authors":["Axel Grimault","Nathalie Bostel","Fabien Lehuédé"],"meta":["June 2017Computers & Operations Research 88","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2017.06.012"],"references":["281202882_A_long-haul_freight_transportation_problem_Synchronizing_resources_to_deliver_requests_passing_through_multiple_transshipment_locations","271737765_Flow-based_integer_linear_programs_to_solve_the_weekly_log-truck_scheduling_problem","257196433_An_adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_the_Pollution-Routing_Problem","251565072_A_heuristic_to_solve_the_synchronized_log-truck_scheduling_problem","236040059_An_adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_arising_in_city_logistics","223369558_The_pickup_and_delivery_problem_with_time_windows","222645645_Hybridization_of_very_large_neighborhood_search_for_ready-mixed_concrete_delivery_problems","220669318_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_Minimizing_Route_Duration","220472915_Vehicle_routing_with_full_loads","220413260_A_Hybrid_Solution_Approach_for_Ready-Mixed_Concrete_Delivery","281566032_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Two-Echelon_Multiple-Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Satellite_Synchronization","273574743_Heuristic_Solutions_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Synchronized_Visits","269399798_Hybrid_Algorithms_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Clustered_Backhauls_and_3D_Loading_Constraints","269032646_A_two-phase_heuristic_for_full_truckload_routing_and_scheduling_with_split_delivery_and_resource_synchronization_in_public_works","265603790_Integrated_scheduling_of_ready-mixed_concrete_production_and_delivery","262316591_The_Dial-A-Ride_Problem_with_Transfers","259928879_Synchronization_in_Vehicle_Routing-A_Survey_of_VRPs_with_Multiple_Synchronization_Constraints","257011865_Efficient_feasibility_testing_for_request_insertion_in_the_Pickup_and_Delivery_Problem_with_Transfers","244486194_Workforce_Routing_and_Scheduling_for_Electricity_Network_Maintenance_with_Downtime_Minimization","233718089_A_Unified_Tabu_Search_Heuristic_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Time_Windows","233574556_Improved_tabu_search_algorithm_for_the_handling_of_route_duration_constraints_in_vehicle_routing_problems_with_time_windows","229642870_A_near-exact_method_for_solving_the_log-truck_scheduling_problem","227086315_A_Tabu_Search_Heuristic_for_a_Full-Load_Multi-Terminal_Vehicle_Scheduling_Problem_with_Backhauling_and_Time_Windows","226194681_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Inter-Tour_Resource_Constraints","226107007_Log-Truck_Scheduling_with_a_Tabu_Search_Strategy","225515642_Adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_for_service_technician_routing_and_scheduling_problems","222578631_New_savings_based_algorithms_for_time_constrained_pickup_and_delivery_of_full_truckloads","222574890_Combined_vehicle_routing_and_scheduling_with_temporal_precedence_and_synchronization_constraints","222554425_A_general_heuristic_for_vehicle_routing_problems","222516811_Record_Breaking_Optimization_Results_Using_the_Ruin_and_Recreate_Principle","222495330_Serial_and_Parallel_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling_Methods_Revisited_Theory_and_Computation","222417197_A_hybrid_method_based_on_linear_programming_and_tabu_search_for_routing_of_logging_trucks","222044983_Dynamic_transport_scheduling_under_multiple_resource_constraints","221704738_Algorithms_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_and_Scheduling_Problems_With_Time_Window_Constraints","221704676_Local_search_in_routing_problems_with_time_windows","220472225_Two-phase_heuristic_algorithms_for_full_truckloads_multi-depot_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem_in_carrier_collaboration","220471107_A_local_search_heuristic_for_the_pre-_and_end-haulage_of_intermodal_container_terminals","220413172_Vehicle_Routing_and_Scheduling_with_Full_Truckloads","220297431_Minimizing_Empty_Truck_Loads_in_Round_Timber_Transport_with_Tabu_Search_Strategies","23794619_The_multiple_traveling_salesman_problem_An_overview_of_formulations_and_solution_procedures","23648268_Analysis_modeling_and_solution_of_the_concrete_delivery_problem","4838462_Pisinger_D_A_unified_heuristic_for_a_large_class_of_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Backhauls_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_1713_750-775"]}
