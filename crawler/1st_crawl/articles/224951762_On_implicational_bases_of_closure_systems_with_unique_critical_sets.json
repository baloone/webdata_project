{"id":"224951762_On_implicational_bases_of_closure_systems_with_unique_critical_sets","abstract":"We show that every optimum basis of a finite closure system, in D.Maier's\nsense, is also right-side optimum, which is a parameter of a minimum CNF\nrepresentation of a Horn Boolean function. New parameters for the size of the\nbinary part are also established. We introduce a K-basis of a general closure\nsystem, which is a refinement of the canonical basis of Duquenne and Guigues,\nand discuss a polynomial algorithm to obtain it. We study closure systems with\nthe unique criticals and some of its subclasses, where the K-basis is unique. A\nfurther refinement in the form of the E-basis is possible for closure systems\nwithout D-cycles. There is a polynomial algorithm to recognize the D-relation\nfrom a K-basis. Thus, closure systems without D-cycles can be effectively\nrecognized. While E-basis achieves an optimum in one of its parts, the\noptimization of the others is an NP-complete problem.","authors":["Kira Adaricheva","James B.
