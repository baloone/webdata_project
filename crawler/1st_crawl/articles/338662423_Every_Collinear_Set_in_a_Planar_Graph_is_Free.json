{"id":"338662423_Every_Collinear_Set_in_a_Planar_Graph_is_Free","abstract":"We show that if a planar graph G has a plane straight-line drawing in which a subset S of its vertices are collinear, then for any set of points, X, in the plane with\\(|X|=|S|\\), there is a plane straight-line drawing of G in which the vertices in S are mapped to the points in X. This solves an open problem posed by Ravsky and Verbitsky (in: Proceedings of the 37th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science, arXiv:0806.0253). In their terminology, we show that every collinear set is free. This result has applications in graph drawing, including untangling, column planarity, universal point subsets, and partial simultaneous drawings.","authors":["Vida Dujmović","Fabrizio Frati","Daniel Gonçalves","Pat Morin"],"meta":["June 2021Discrete & Computational Geometry 65(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-019-00167-x"],"references":["327181991_Aligned_Drawings_of_Planar_Graphs","320339439_Column_planarity_and_partially-simultaneous_geometric_embedding","305881262_Drawing_Planar_Graphs_with_Many_Collinear_Vertices","322620768_Aligned_Drawings_of_Planar_Graphs","312206444_The_Utility_of_Untangling","311508100_Drawing_Planar_Graphs_with_Many_Collinear_Vertices","283811234_Planar_and_Quasi-Planar_Simultaneous_Geometric_Embedding","279612851_E3341","268659597_Universal_Point_Subsets_for_Planar_Graphs","254863181_Superpatterns_and_Universal_Point_Sets","225722154_A_Polynomial_Bound_for_Untangling_Geometric_Planar_Graphs","243134315_A_1235_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_points_needed_to_draw_all_n-vertex_planar_graphs","222823532_Untangling_planar_graphs_from_a_specified_vertex_position-Hard_cases","222775023_On_embedding_an_outer-planar_graph_in_a_point_set","222480779_Checking_the_Convexity_of_Polytopes_and_the_Planarity_of_Subdivisions"]}
