{"id":"309025726_A_Comparison_of_Data_Compression_Methods_for_Solving_Problems_of_Temperature_Monitoring","abstract":"The paper considers the problem of large processing huge amounts of data for temperature monitoring of man-made and natural objects associated with the lack of data compression efficiency in real time when they are transferred and stored in the presence of anomalies in the information signal in the form of sudden changes and outlier. The solutions of existing methods were described and new approaches were proposed. The results of experimental comparison of proposed and known solutions are included.","authors":["Husssein Mogahed","Alexey Yakunin","Larisa Suchkova"],"meta":["January 2016MATEC Web of Conferences 79(8):01076","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/20167901076"],"references":["308374530_Compression-Based_Methods_of_Statistical_Analysis_and_Prediction_of_Time_Series","303506032_Sensor_Selection_method_for_IoT_systems_-_focusing_on_embedded_system_requirements","295254434_Digital_Filters_with_Memory","281722614_Application_of_Remote_Sensing_Technology_in_Mine_Environment_Monitoring","260156521_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Applications_A_Study_in_Environment_Monitoring_System","258519732_Chain_code_lossless_compression_using_move-to-front_transform_and_adaptive_run-length_encoding","254008552_MySQL_and_the_trouble_with_temporal_data","321617600_Data_Compression_The_Complete_Reference","300203345_Issues_in_Global_Environmental_Monitoring","252064679_Handbook_of_data_compression"]}
