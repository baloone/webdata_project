{"id":"325664280_Comparative_Analysis_of_Various_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detecting_Dementia","abstract":"Nowadays, there has been recent interest in applying machine learning techniques to the neurodegenerative disorders. Dementia is one such emerging global health issue and its early detection can be very helpful. A comparative analysis of four machine learning algorithms i.e., J48, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron is presented in this paper. For the attribute reduction, the CFSSubsetEval is used. It has been shown that J48 is performing best among all the algorithms for the detection of Dementia.","authors":["Deepika Bansal","Rita Chhikara","Kavita Khanna","Poonam Gupta"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Computer Science 132:1497-1502","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2018.05.102"],"references":["318403286_Diagnosis_of_Dementia_by_Machine_learning_methods_in_Epidemiological_studies_a_pilot_exploratory_study_from_south_India","318341147_Identifying_incipient_dementia_individuals_using_machine_learning_and_amyloid_imaging","317865376_Early_Diagnosis_of_Dementia_from_Clinical_Data_by_Machine_Learning_Techniques","291689871_Comparison_of_Feature_Selection_Techniques_in_Machine_Learning_for_Anatomical_Brain_MRI_in_Dementia","288835251_Data_Mining-_Introductory_and_Advanced_Topics","276295931_Dementia_definitions_and_types","332962259_The_changing_prevalence_and_incidence_of_dementia_over_time_-_current_evidence","312609767_Mini-mental_state-practical_method_for_grading_cognitive_state_of_patients_for_clinicians","308729854_Diagnosis_of_Alzheimer's_Disease_Employing_Neuropsychological_and_Classification_Techniques","263416087_Artificial_Neural_Networks_The_Multilayer_Perceptron_-_A_Review_of_Applications_in_the_Atmospheric_Sciences"]}
