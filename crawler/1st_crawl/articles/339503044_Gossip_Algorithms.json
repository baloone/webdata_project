{"id":"339503044_Gossip_Algorithms","abstract":"Gossip network algorithms, as the name suggests, are built upon a gossip or rumor style unreliable, asynchronous information exchange protocol. They provide algorithmic architecture of choice for many of the emerging networks -- such as sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, social networks and mobile networks of vehicles -- that are primarily not designed for, but required to perform communication and computation. Examples include, estimation algorithms in sensor networks, broadcasting news through a peer-to-peer network, or viral advertising in a social network. Gossip algorithms captures the recent excitement in this interdisciplinary topic that is witnessed across the fields of communication, computation, control, signal processing and algorithms","authors":["Devavrat Shah"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1561/9781601982377","ISBN: 9781601982377"],"references":[]}
