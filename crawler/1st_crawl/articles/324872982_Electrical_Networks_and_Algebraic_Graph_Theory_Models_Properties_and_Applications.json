{"id":"324872982_Electrical_Networks_and_Algebraic_Graph_Theory_Models_Properties_and_Applications","abstract":"Algebraic graph theory is a cornerstone in the study of electrical networks ranging from miniature integrated circuits to continental-scale power systems. Conversely, many fundamental results of algebraic graph theory were laid out by early electrical circuit analysts. In this paper, we survey some fundamental and historic as well as recent results on how algebraic graph theory informs electrical network analysis, dynamics, and design. In particular, we review the algebraic and spectral properties of graph adjacency, Laplacian, incidence, and resistance matrices and how they relate to the analysis, network reduction, and dynamics of certain classes of electrical networks. We study these relations for models of increasing complexity ranging from static resistive direct current (dc) circuits, over dynamic resistor..inductor..capacitor (RLC) circuits, to nonlinear alternating current (ac) power flow. We conclude this paper by presenting a set of fundamental open questions at the intersection of algebraic graph theory and electrical networks.","authors":["Florian DÃ¶rfler","John W.
