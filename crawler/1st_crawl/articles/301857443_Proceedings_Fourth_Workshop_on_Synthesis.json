{"id":"301857443_Proceedings_Fourth_Workshop_on_Synthesis","abstract":"The SYNT workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the broad area of synthesis of computing systems. The goal is to foster the development of frontier techniques in automating the development of computing system. Contributions of interest include algorithms, complexity and decidability analysis, as well as reproducible heuristics, implemented tools, and experimental evaluation. Application domains include software, hardware, embedded, and cyberphysical systems. Computation models include functional, reactive, hybrid and timed systems. Identifying, formalizing, and evaluating synthesis in particular application domains is encouraged. The fourth iteration of the workshop took place in San Francisco, CA, USA. It was co-located with the 27th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification. The workshop included five contributed talks and two invited talks. In addition, it featured a special session about the Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (SyGuS) and the SyntComp Synthesis competition.","authors":["Pavol Černý","Viktor Kuncak","Madhusudan Parthasarathy"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.202"],"references":[]}
