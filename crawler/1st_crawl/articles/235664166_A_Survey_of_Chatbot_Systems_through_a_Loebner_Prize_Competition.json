{"id":"235664166_A_Survey_of_Chatbot_Systems_through_a_Loebner_Prize_Competition","abstract":"Starting in 1966 with the introduction of the ELIZA chatbot, a great deal of effort has been devoted towards the goal of developing a chatbot system that would be able to pass the Turing Test. These efforts have resulted in the creation of a variety of technologies and have taken a variety of approaches. In this paper we compare and discuss the different technologies used in the chatbots which have won the Loebner Prize Competition, the first formal instantiation of the Turing Test. Although there was no game changing breakthrough in the chatbot technologies, it is obvious they evolved from the very simple pattern matching systems towards complicated patterns combined with ontologies and knowledge bases enabling computer reasoning.","authors":["Luka Bradeško","Dunja Mladenić"],"meta":["January 2012","Conference: Slovenian Language Technologies Society Eighth Conference of Language TechnologiesAt: LjubljanaVolume: Proceedings of Slovenian Language Technologies Society Eighth Conference of Language Technologies"],"references":["2333743_CYC_A_Large-Scale_Investment_in_Knowledge_Infrastructure","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","291154910_Bots_as_language_learning_tools","244444661_The_Elements_of_AIML_Style","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","38412694_Does_the_Turing_Test_demonstrate_intelligence_or_not","2582681_How_to_Pass_the_Turing_Test_by_Cheating"]}
