{"id":"230916146_A_Simple_Void-searching_Algorithm","abstract":"We have developed a new automatic void-searching algorithm for three-dimensional redshift surveys and N-body simulations. We strictly define the condition that is called a void. This definition is used to make a new and automatic algorithm that finds voids from particle distributions. We introduce our algorithm and show with test simulations that it is a robust tool for automatic void searching and void statistics calculations.","authors":["J. Aikio","P.
