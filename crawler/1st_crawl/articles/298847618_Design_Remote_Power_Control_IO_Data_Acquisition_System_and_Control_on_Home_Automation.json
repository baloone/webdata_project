{"id":"298847618_Design_Remote_Power_Control_IO_Data_Acquisition_System_and_Control_on_Home_Automation","abstract":"In this paper we have designed a remote power control based on both an embedded board and on ZigBee communication. This design consists of two parts that regard as the essential two Control parts, the ZigBee control module and the server module. Where, The main objective of this article is show the control of electro-electronics devices using a PC software and a embedded system, sending and receiving remote data around one kilometer. The text shows the radiofrequency interface, the choice and programming of a microcontroller and the PC software that controls it and also provides a detailed description of the proposed system, from design to implementation, as well as the results of the demonstration experiment.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid","Surya Prakash","A K Bhardwaj"],"meta":["January 2013","Projects: Design Remote Power Control I/O Data Acquisition System And Control On Home AutomationPeripherals, Components, and Applications of Allen-Bradley PLC"],"references":["4348942_Remote_power_OnOff_control_and_current_measurement_for_home_electric_outlets_based_on_a_low-power_embedded_board_and_ZigBee_communication"]}
