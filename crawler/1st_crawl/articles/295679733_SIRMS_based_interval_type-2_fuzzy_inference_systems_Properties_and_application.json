{"id":"295679733_SIRMS_based_interval_type-2_fuzzy_inference_systems_Properties_and_application","abstract":"The single input rule modules (SIRMs) based type-1 fuzzy inference systems (SIRM-TIFIS.s), which assign each input item, with a rule module, can greatly reduce the number of fuzzy rules and have found lots of applications. This paper extends SIBM-T1FISs to the interval type-2 case to achieve better performance. Furthermore, the properties of the SIRMs based interval type-2 fuzzy inference systems (SIRM-IT2FISs) are investigated. These properties are focused on clarifying the relationships of different fuzzy inference systems (FISs): I) the relationships between SIBM-IT2FISs and their corresponding Takagi-Sugeno (TS) IT2FISs, 2) the relationships between SIRM-1T2FISs and TS T1FISs. These results can help us to deepen our understanding of the SIRMs based FISs. At last, an application to the anti-swing and positioning control of an overhead crane system is given to show the effectiveness of the SIRM-IT2FIS, and comparisons with other control methods are made to demonstrate the superiority of the SIRM-IT2FIS.","authors":["Chengdong Li","Jianqiang Yi"],"meta":["September 2010International journal of innovative computing, information & control: IJICIC 6(9):4019-4028"],"references":["220371347_Stabilization_fuzzy_control_of_inverted_pendulum_systems","223496464_A_new_fuzzy_controller_for_stabilization_of_parallel-type_double_inverted_pendulum_system","223340297_Anti-swing_and_positioning_control_of_overhead_traveling_crane","222819146_Advances_in_type-2_sets_and_systems","222604266_Paper_A_linguistic_self-organizing_process_controller","220467093_On_the_Generalization_of_Single_Input_Rule_Modules_Connected_Type_Fuzzy_Reasoning_Method","3335802_On_stability_of_fuzzy_systems_expressed_by_fuzzy_rules_with_singleton_consequents"]}
