A set of vertices S resolves a connected graph G if every vertex is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in S. The metric dimension of G is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of G. Let Gβ,D be the set of graphs with metric dimension β and diameter D. It is well-known that the minimum order of a graph in Gβ,D is exactly β + D. The first contribution of this paper is to characterise the graphs in Gβ,D with order β + D for all values of β and D. Such a characterisation was previously only known for D � 2 or β � 1. The second contribution is to determine the maximum order of a graph in Gβ,D for all values of","authors":["M.
