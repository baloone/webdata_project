{"id":"228558368_A_variety_theorem_without_complementation","abstract":"this paper is to showthat such results are not isolated, but are instances of a result as general as Eilenberg'stheorem. On the language side, we consider positive varieties of languages, which have thesame properties as varieties of languages except they are not supposed to be closed undercomplement. On the algebraic side, varieties of finite semigroups are replaced by varietiesof finite ordered semigroups. Our main result states there is a one-to-one correspondencebetween positive...","authors":["Jean-Eric Pin"],"meta":["January 1995"],"references":["281793182_Combinatorics_on_Words","267334498_Semigroups_and_Combinatorial_Applications","256206328_Partially_ordered_finite_monoids_and_a_theorem_of_I_Simon","234798109_Varieties_Of_Formal_Languages","220692187_Applied_Combinatorics_on_Words"]}
