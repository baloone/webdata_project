{"id":"280051672_Fundamentals_of_Linear_Time-Varying_Systems","abstract":"In this chapter, various fundamental elements of the theory of linear time-varying systems are studied in both the continuous-time and discrete-time cases. The chapter is a revised and updated version of Chapter 25 that appeared in the first edition of The Control Handbook. The revision includes material on the existence of coordinate transformations that transform time-varying system matrices into diagonal form, and the connection to the concept of \"dynamic\" eigenvalues and eigenvectors.","authors":["Edward Walter Kamen"],"meta":["December 2010","DOI:10.1201/b10384-5","In book: The Control Systems Handbook (pp.3-1 to 3-33)Edition: Second EditionChapter: 3Publisher: CRC Press"],"references":["317730212_The_Frequency_Response_Function_of_a_Linear_Time-Varying_System","267670910_Time-Varying_Systems_and_Computations","248675176_Mathematical_Control_Theory","316816563_Minimum_Entropy_Control_for_Time-Varying_Systems","274523886_Theory_and_Application_of_the_Z-Transform_Method","267665653_A_Transfer-Function_Approach_to_Linear_Time-Varying_Discrete-Time_Systems","256206327_Vandermonde_and_Wronskian_matrices_over_division_rings","243092701_Algebraic_Theory_of_Linear_Time-Varying_Systems","238872796_Rings_With_a_Weak_Algorithm","237682064_Stabilizability_and_Stable-Proper_Factorizations_for_Linear_Time-Varying_Systems"]}
