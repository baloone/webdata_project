{"id":"8681398_Asian_American_Multidimensional_Acculturation_Scale_Development_Factor_Analysis_Reliability_and_Validity","abstract":"This article describes the development and psychometric properties of the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS). The results of 3 separate studies provide strong evidence of the instrument's reliability and validity. The principles for the development of the AAMAS were orthogonality of cultural dimensions, inclusion of a pan-ethnic Asian American dimension, and ease of use across ethnic groups. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate that within each cultural dimension (AAMAS-Culture of Origin, AAMAS-Asian American, and AAMAS-European American) there are 4 reliable acculturation domains of cultural identity, language, cultural knowledge, and food consumption. These features of the AAMAS allow for a more complex assessment of acculturation level of Asian Americans and its relationship to psychological functioning.","authors":["Hyo Jin Gim","Bryan S K Kim","Jose M Abreu"],"meta":["March 2004Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 10(1):66-80","DOI:10.1037/1099-9809.10.1.66","SourcePubMed"],"references":["247746730_Language_and_the_Bicultural_Self","314794413_Counselor_helping_model_participant_ethnicity_and_acculturation_level_and_perceived_counselor_credibility","313720078_Society_and_the_adolescent_self-image","313622331_Ethnic_identity_and_acculturation","289808841_ASSESSING_AND_UNDERSTANDING_BICULTURALISM-MULTICULTURALISM_IN_MEXICAN-AMERICAN_ADULTS","286065482_Asian_American_Panethnicity_and_Intermarriage","272160305_Modes_of_Individualism_and_Collectivism","263064091_The_Future_of_Cross-Cultural_Counseling_A_Delphi_Poll","258144183_An_Empirical_Scale_to_Measure_Type_and_Degree_of_Acculturation_in_Mexican_American_Adolescents_and_Adults","247727938_A_Psychometric_Evaluation_of_the_Six-Factor_Self-Concept_Scale_in_a_Sample_of_RacialEthnic_Minority_Women"]}
