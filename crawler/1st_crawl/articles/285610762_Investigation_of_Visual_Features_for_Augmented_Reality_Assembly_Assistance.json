{"id":"285610762_Investigation_of_Visual_Features_for_Augmented_Reality_Assembly_Assistance","abstract":"The overall goal of this research is to investigate the effec-tivity of augmented reality (AR) assembly assistance in relation to the difficulty of a particular assembly task since advantages of AR, such as time and error reduction, have not been consequently reported in literature. The research aims to identify additional factors that affect the design of virtual instructions for AR applications. This paper intends to discuss a suggested classification of visual features for AR assembly assistance applications. The classification suggests visual features for different assembly activities and distinguishes significant from less significant parts. It represents a theoretical framework for this research. A user study was conducted to verify the suggested visual features. The results are not significant and do not support the classification. However, observations made during the study indicate additional factors.","authors":["Rafael Radkowski"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-21067-4_50","Conference: International Conference on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality"],"references":["272476275_Augmented_Reality-Based_Manual_Assembly_Support_With_Visual_Features_for_Different_Degrees_of_Difficulty","263849012_Intelligent_Augmented_Reality_Training_for_Assembly_Tasks","248516797_Towards_an_Assembly_Plan_from_Observation","245331347_Augmented_reality_for_assembly_guidance_using_a_virtual_interactive_tool","222420975_Construction_and_interference_in_learning_from_multiple_representation","221519088_Comparative_effectiveness_of_augmented_reality_in_object_assembly","221332126_Fun_and_Usable_Augmented_Reality_Instructions_in_a_Hospital_Setting","220832727_Guidelines_for_Implementing_Augmented_Reality_Procedures_in_Assisting_Assembly_Operations","220495654_Instructional_animations_can_be_superior_to_static_when_learning_human_motor_skills","220183579_Designing_effective_step-by-step_assembly_instructions","8554486_What_Attributes_Guide_the_Deployment_of_Visual_Attention_and_How_Do_They_Do_It","7387976_Visualization_task_performance_with_2D_3D_and_combination_displays","4303324_Multimodal_User_Interface_for_Augmented_Assembly","4040608_Authoring_of_a_mixed_reality_assembly_instructor_for_hierarchical_structures","3811976_Virtual_reality_and_augmented_reality_as_a_training_tool_for_assembly_tasks","3230319_Factors_Affecting_the_Processing_of_Procedural_Instructions_Implications_for_Document_Design","321505869_Industrial_Assembly","315400804_Augmented_reality_in_the_psychomotor_phase_of_a_procedural_task","279920340_Learning_a_Procedural_Task_Effectiveness_of_Multimedia_Presentations","279235404_Image_and_Brain","257337678_Augmented_reality_aided_interactive_manual_assembly_design","257252837_An_empirical_evaluation_of_multi-media_based_learning_of_a_procedural_task","251881049_Augmented_Reality_Training_Platform_for_Assembly_and_Maintenance_Skills","226600830_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_augmented_reality_displays_for_a_manual_assembly_task","221221164_Augmented_reality_in_the_psychomotor_phase_of_a_procedural_task","221018172_An_Effectiveness_Study_of_Pictogram_Elements_for_Steps_in_Manufacturing_Procedures","220302408_Augmented_Reality_AR_for_Assembly_Processes_Design_and_Experimental_Evaluation","30832128_Building_physical_and_mental_models_in_assembly_tasks","7378576_When_Static_Media_Promote_Active_Learning_Annotated_Illustrations_Versus_Narrated_Animations_in_Multimedia_Instruction","2418711_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality","2302607_Aspect_Windows_3-D_Visualizations_and_Indirect_Comparisons_of_Information_Retrieval_Systems"]}
