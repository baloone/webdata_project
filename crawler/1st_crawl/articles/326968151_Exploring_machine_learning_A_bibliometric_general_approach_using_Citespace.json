{"id":"326968151_Exploring_machine_learning_A_bibliometric_general_approach_using_Citespace","abstract":"Background: Machine learning researches algorithms that allow a machine to learn about resolving problems in different application domains. Due to the wide number of machine learning applications, it is necessary for newcomers to the field to have alternatives to explore this field faster.\nMethods: In this paper, we present a science mapping analysis on the machine learning research in the period 2007-2017. This study was develop using the CiteSpace tool based on results from Clarivate Web of Science. This analysis shows how the field has evolved, by highlighting the most notable authors, institutions, keywords, countries, categories, and journals.\nResults: The results provide information on trends and possibilities in the near future, particularly in areas such as health, biology and banking, where machine learning is a valuable tool to generate solutions.\nConclusions: Machine learning is being widely studied, and several institutions in countries like the USA and China constantly generate machine learning based solutions. Diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimerâ€™s disease, studies in biology, such as the protein molecule, virtual reality, commerce, smartphones, and ubiquitous computing, are all fields where machine learning contributes to resolving problems.","authors":["Juan Rincon-Patino","Gustavo Ramirez-Gonzalez","Juan Carlos Corrales"],"meta":["August 2018F1000 Research 7:1240","DOI:10.12688/f1000research.15619.1"],"references":["326890032_Exploring_machine_learning_A_bibliometric_general_approach_using_SciMAT","320550516_Machine_learning_methods_An_overview","318322844_Detecting_and_predicting_the_topic_change_of_Knowledge-based_Systems_A_topic-based_bibliometric_analysis_from_1991_to_2016","315525946_The_State_of_the_Art_in_Integrating_Machine_Learning_into_Visual_Analytics_Integrating_Machine_Learning_into_Visual_Analytics","299358471_A_review_of_emerging_trends_in_global_PPP_research_analysis_and_visualization","291336681_Topical_Analysis_and_Forecasting_for_Science_Technology_and_Innovation_Methodology_and_a_Case_Study_focusing_on_Big_Data_Research","303635817_Big_Data_and_machine_learning_in_radiation_oncology_State_of_the_art_and_future_prospects","274382952_A_scientometric_review_of_emerging_trends_and_new_developments_in_recommendation_systems","270701881_Analyzing_the_Scientific_Evolution_of_Social_Work_Using_Science_Mapping","270595589_25_years_at_KnoSys_A_bibliometric_analysis"]}
