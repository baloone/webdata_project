{"id":"282072691_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_Over_Infinite_Words","abstract":"The study of various decision problems for logic fragments has a long history\nin computer science. This paper is on the membership problem for a fragment of\nfirst-order logic over infinite words; the membership problem asks for a given\nlanguage whether it is definable in some fixed fragment. The alphabetic\ntopology was introduced as part of an effective characterization of the\nfragment $\\Sigma_2$ over infinite words. Here, $\\Sigma_2$ consists of the\nfirst-order formulas with two blocks of quantifiers, starting with an\nexistential quantifier. Its Boolean closure is $\\mathbb{B}\\Sigma_2$. Our first\nmain result is an effective characterization of the Boolean closure of the\nalphabetic topology, that is, given an $\\omega$-regular language $L$, it is\ndecidable whether $L$ is a Boolean combination of open sets in the alphabetic\ntopology. This is then used for transferring Place and Zeitoun's recent\ndecidability result for $\\mathbb{B}\\Sigma_2$ from finite to infinite words.","authors":["Manfred Kufleitner","Tobias Walter"],"meta":["April 2018Theory of Computing Systems 62(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-017-9801-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["318527813_Going_Higher_in_First-Order_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchies_on_Words","312787250_Handbook_of_Theoretical_Computer_Science","309091937_Quantifier_Alternation_for_Infinite_Words","303691243_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_over_Infinite_Words","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","265667603_Automata_languages_and_machines_Vol_A","261952337_Going_Higher_in_the_First-Order_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_on_Words","258082322_One_Quantifier_Alternation_in_First-Order_Logic_with_Modular_Predicates","243677621_Finite_semigroup_varieties_of_the_form_V_D","241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic","225953511_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Infinite_Words","238698002_Decision_Problems_for_omega-Automata","234800941_Automata_on_Infinite_Objects","228558368_A_variety_theorem_without_complementation","222445123_Classifying_regular_events_in_symbolic_logic"]}
