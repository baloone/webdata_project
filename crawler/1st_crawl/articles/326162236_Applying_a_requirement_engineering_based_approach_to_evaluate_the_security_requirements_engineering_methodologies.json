{"id":"326162236_Applying_a_requirement_engineering_based_approach_to_evaluate_the_security_requirements_engineering_methodologies","abstract":"Considering the multitude of security requirements engineering methodologies available today, selecting a security requirement engineering methodology that fits the security engineering context becomes a promising task. In previous work, we outlined a generic evaluation methodology to elicit and evaluate the anticipated characteristics of a security requirements engineering methodology according to the stakeholders' working context. In this paper, we detail each step of our methodology using an example context of network security requirements engineering.","authors":["Sravani Teja Bulusu","Romain Laborde","Ahmad Samer Wazan","François Barrère"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1145/3167132.3167417","Conference: the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium"],"references":["319047875_Which_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methodology_Should_I_Choose_Towards_a_Requirements_Engineering-based_Evaluation_Approach","314159751_Towards_the_Weaving_of_the_Characteristics_of_Good_Security_Requirements","268002869_Modelling_Security_Requirements_in_Socio-Technical_Systems_with_STS-Tool","221548892_A_Pattern_System_for_Security_Requirements_Engineering","295863515_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Designing_Secure_Socio-Technical_Systems","4083545_Elaborating_security_requirements_by_construction_of_intentional_anti-models"]}
