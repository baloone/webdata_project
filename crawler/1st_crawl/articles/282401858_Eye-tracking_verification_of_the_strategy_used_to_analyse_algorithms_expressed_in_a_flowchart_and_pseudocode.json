{"id":"282401858_Eye-tracking_verification_of_the_strategy_used_to_analyse_algorithms_expressed_in_a_flowchart_and_pseudocode","abstract":"The results of qualitative and quantitative investigations conducted with individuals who learned algorithms in school are presented in this article. In these investigations, eye-tracking technology was used to follow the process of solving algorithmic problems. The algorithmic problems were presented in two comparable variants: in a pseudocode and flowchart. The eye-tracking data resulted in both qualitative (films registering the gaze paths) and quantitative measures, which allowed the detection and interpretation of the differences in the task-solving strategies between those who found the correct answer and those that did not. The results confirmed a hypothesis that use of the formal notation characteristic of a programming language for presenting algorithms is often a practical difficulty in the process of solving even simple tasks. This study opens a new direction of research; they show that eye-tracking technology can be used to optimise the educational process of learning programming.","authors":["Magdalena Andrzejewska","Anna Stolińska","Władysław Błasiak","Paweł Pęczkowski"],"meta":["September 2016Interactive Learning Environments 24(8):1981-1995","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2015.1073746"],"references":["273851906_Analysis_of_Research_in_Programming_Teaching_Tools_An_Initial_Review","259703630_Eye_Tracking_in_Human-Computer_Interaction_and_Usability_Research_Ready_to_Deliver_the_Promises","237524669_PROBLEMS_IN_LEARNING_AND_TEACHING_PROGRAMMING_-_a_literature_study_for_developing_visualizations_in_the_Codewitz-Minerva_project","233813483_Orienting_of_attention","47739688_The_construction_and_evaluation_of_a_Attention_Questionnaire","15830678_Orienting_of_Attention","8427000_Covert_shift_of_attention_precede_involuntary_eye_movements","298978234_Covert_shifts_of_attention_precede_involuntary_eye_movements","289981288_Selective_attention_and_the_organization_of_visual_information","259165122_A_review_of_using_eye-tracking_technology_in_exploring_learning_from_2000_to_2012","257480349_A_review_of_eye-tracking_applications_as_tools_for_training","240427459_The_use_of_eye_movements_in_the_study_of_multimedia_learning","223377093_In_the_eyes_of_the_beholder_How_experts_and_novices_interpret_dynamic_stimuli","220495113_Attention_guidance_during_example_study_via_the_model's_eye_movements","220095366_An_examination_of_cognitive_processing_of_multimedia_information_based_on_viewers'_eye_movements","23270853_Taking_a_new_look_at_looking_at_nothing","21364100_Discriminating_Artists_from_Nonartists_by_Their_Eye-Fixation_Patterns","16954791_Selective_attention_and_the_organization_of_visual_information","8608108_Neuroscience_and_Education","6150507_Predicting_visual_fixations_on_video_based_on_low-level_visual_features","3246689_Structured_flowcharts_outperform_pseudocode_An_experimental_comparison"]}
