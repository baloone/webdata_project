{"id":"251312713_Inverse_1-median_problem_on_trees_under_weighted_Hamming_distance","abstract":"The inverse 1-median problem consists in modifying the weights of the customers at minimum cost such that a prespecified supplier\nbecomes the 1-median of modified location problem. A linear time algorithm is first proposed for the inverse problem under\nweighted l\nâˆž norm. Then two polynomial time algorithms with time complexities O(n log n) and O(n) are given for the problem under weighted bottleneck-Hamming distance, where n is the number of vertices. Finally, the problem under weighted sum-Hamming distance is shown to be equivalent to a 0-1 knapsack\nproblem, and hence is $${\\mathcal{NP}}$$ -hard.","authors":["Xiucui Guan","Zhang Binwu"],"meta":["September 2012Journal of Global Optimization 54(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10898-011-9742-x","Project: Inverse network  location problems and network location improvement problems"],"references":["254253656_Constrained_and_bicriteria_inverse_bottleneck_optimization_problems_under_weighted_Hamming_distance","239543676_An_Algorithm_for_Large_Zero-One_Knapsack_Problems","227333991_Some_inverse_min-max_network_problems_under_weighted_l_1_and_l_norms_with_bound_constraints_on_changes","226844706_Inverse_1-median_Problem_on_Trees_under_Weighted_l_Norm","226039143_The_Complexity_Analysis_of_the_Inverse_Center_Location_Problem","225674778_Inverse_median_location_problems_with_variable_coordinates","285013642_Application_of_mathematical_methods_to_wheat_harvesting","238691273_Optimal_Center_Location_in_Simple_Networks","225810058_Approximation_Schemes_for_a_Class_of_Subset_Selection_Problems","225367682_Constrained_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_under_the_Bottleneck-Type_Hamming_Distance"]}
