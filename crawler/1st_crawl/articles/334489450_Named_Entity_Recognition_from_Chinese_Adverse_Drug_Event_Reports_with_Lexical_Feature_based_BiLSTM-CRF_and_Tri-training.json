{"id":"334489450_Named_Entity_Recognition_from_Chinese_Adverse_Drug_Event_Reports_with_Lexical_Feature_based_BiLSTM-CRF_and_Tri-training","abstract":"Background: \nThe Adverse Drug Event Reports (ADERs) from the spontaneous reporting system are important data sources for studying Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) as well as post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Apart from the conventional ADR information contained in the structured section of ADERs, more detailed information such as pre- and post- ADR symptoms, multi-drug usages and ADR-relief treatments are described in the free-text section, which can be mined through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.\n\nObjective: \nThe goal of this study was to extract ADR-related entities from free-text section of Chinese ADERs, which can act as supplements for the information contained in structured section, so as to further assist in ADR evaluation.\n\nMethods: \nThree models of Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) and Lexical Feature based BiLSTM-CRF (LF-BiLSTM-CRF) were constructed to conduct Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in free-text section of Chinese ADERs. A semi-supervised learning method of tri-training was applied on the basis of the three established models to give un-annotated raw data with reliable tags.\n\nResults: \nAmong the three basic models, the LF-BiLSTM-CRF achieved the highest average F1 score of 94.35%. After the process of tri-training, almost half of the un-annotated cases were tagged with labels, and the performances of all the three models improved after iterative training.\n\nConclusions: \nThe LF-BiLSTM-CRF model that we constructed could achieve a comparatively high F1 score, and the fusion of CRF, while BiLSTM-CRF and LF-BiLSTM-CRF in tri-training might further strengthen the reliability of predicted tags. The results suggested the usefulness of our methods in developing the specialized NER tools for identifying ADR-related information from Chinese ADERs.","authors":["Yao Chen","Changjiang Zhou","Tianxin Li","Hong Wu"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Biomedical Informatics 96:103252","DOI:10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103252"],"references":["324473468_Toward_a_normalized_clinical_drug_knowledge_base_in_China_-_Applying_the_RxNorm_model_to_Chinese_clinical_drugs","319524409_Semi-Supervised_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Adverse_Drug_Reaction_Mention_Extraction","318738980_F-Score_Driven_Max_Margin_Neural_Network_for_Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Chinese_Social_Media","317947625_LSTM-CRF_for_Drug-Named_Entity_Recognition","309719928_Disease_named_entity_recognition_by_combining_conditional_random_fields_and_bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks","305334469_Neural_Architectures_for_Named_Entity_Recognition","303522018_Feature_Engineering_for_Recognizing_Adverse_Drug_Reactions_from_Twitter_Posts","301352772_Chemical_named_entity_recognition_in_patents_by_domain_knowledge_and_unsupervised_feature_learning","301296562_Extraction_of_chemical-induced_diseases_using_prior_knowledge_and_textual_information","281815157_Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Chinese_Clinical_Text_Using_Deep_Neural_Network","275893846_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Word_Representations_for_Twitter_Named_Entity_Recognition","274093174_Incorporating_domain_knowledge_in_chemical_and_biomedical_named_entity_recognition_with_word_representations","274093096_Chemical_entity_extraction_using_CRF_and_an_ensemble_of_extractors","273786930_Pharmacovigilance_from_social_media_Mining_adverse_drug_reaction_mentions_using_sequence_labeling_with_word_embedding_cluster_features","259353201_A_comprehensive_study_of_named_entity_recognition_in_Chinese_clinical_text","256538414_LPIIS2013_Chinese_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Conditional_Random_Fields_in_the_Light_of_Chinese_Characteristics","247157861_Adverse_drug_reactions_to_antiretroviral_therapy_Results_from_spontaneous_reporting_system_in_Nigeria","234161875_WHO_Strategy_for_Collecting_Safety_Data_in_Public_Health_Programmes_Complementing_Spontaneous_Reporting_Systems","221080352_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks_for_Improved_Phoneme_Classification_and_Recognition","44688158_A_signal_for_an_abuse_liability_for_pregabalin-results_from_the_Swedish_spontaneous_adverse_drug_reaction_reporting_system","44062524_A_Survey_of_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Classification","43647767_A_Conditional_Random_Field_Approach_for_Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Bengali_and_Hindi","12292425_Learning_to_Forget_Continual_Prediction_with_LSTM","7782148_Identifying_Gene_and_Protein_Mentions_in_Text_Using_Conditional_Random_Fields","321428703_An_Attention-based_BiLSTM-CRF_Approach_to_Document-level_Chemical_Named_Entity_Recognition","320246683_Multichannel_LSTM-CRF_for_Named_Entity_Recognition_in_Chinese_Social_Media","318198100_Prescription_Extraction_Using_CRFs_and_Word_Embeddings","318080498_Impact_of_Medicine_Withdrawal_on_Reporting_of_Adverse_Events_Involving_Therapeutic_Alternatives_A_Study_from_the_French_Spontaneous_Reporting_Database","318029292_Recurrent_neural_networks_with_specialized_word_embeddings_for_health-domain_named-entity_recognition","316974832_Mining_e-cigarette_adverse_events_in_social_media_using_Bi-LSTM_recurrent_neural_network_with_word_embedding_representation","316863199_Character-Level_Neural_Network_for_Biomedical_Named_Entity_Recognition","315653230_Deep_learning_for_pharmacovigilance_Recurrent_neural_network_architectures_for_labeling_adverse_drug_reactions_in_Twitter_posts","311317474_Character-Based_LSTM-CRF_with_Radical-Level_Features_for_Chinese_Named_Entity_Recognition","310622391_A_multiclass_classification_method_based_on_deep_learning_for_named_entity_recognition_in_electronic_medical_records","301412593_Protein_named_entity_classification_with_probabilistic_features_derived_from_GENIA_corpus_and_MEDLINE","299344429_A_Graph_Kernel_Based_on_Context_Vectors_for_Extracting_Drug-Drug_Interactions","283762363_USFD_Twitter_NER_with_Drift_Compensation_and_Linked_Data","276857815_Named_entity_recognition_and_classification_in_biomedical_text_using_classifier_ensemble","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","224610398_Biomedical_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Tri-Training_Learning","12254624_Adverse_drug_reactions_Definitions_diagnosis_and_management","3297469_Tri-training_Exploiting_unlabeled_data_using_three_classifiers"]}
