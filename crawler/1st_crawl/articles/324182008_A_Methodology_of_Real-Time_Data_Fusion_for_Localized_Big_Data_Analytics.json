{"id":"324182008_A_Methodology_of_Real-Time_Data_Fusion_for_Localized_Big_Data_Analytics","abstract":"The traditional big-data analytical approaches use data clustering as small buckets while providing distributed computation among different child nodes. These approaches bring the issues especially concerning network capacity, specialized tools and applications not capable of being trained in a short period. Furthermore, raw data generated through IoT forming Big Data comes with the capability of producing highly unstructured and heterogeneous form of data. Such form of data grows into challenging task for the real-time analytics. It is highly valuable to have computational values available locally instead of through distributed resources to reduce real-time analytical challenges. This research proposes a fusion of three different data models like relational, semantical and big data based data and metadata involving their issues and enhanced capabilities. A case study is used to represent data fusion in action from RDB to RDF. Whereas, issues and their feasible solutions are also being discussed in this manuscript.","authors":["Sohail Jabbar","Kaleem Razzaq Malik","Mudassar Ahmad","Omer Aldabbas"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2820176"],"references":["330174364_Parametric_schema_inference_for_massive_JSON_datasets","320184192_Semantic_Web_Datatype_Inference_Towards_Better_RDF_Matching","312015882_Linked_Open_Vocabularies_LOV_A_gateway_to_reusable_semantic_vocabularies_on_the_Web","352627635_Abstract_229_Real-world_hsCRP_Testing_With_a_Potential_to_Evaluate_Residual_Inflammatory_Cardiovascular_Risk_Among_Patients_With_History_of_Myocardial_Infarction_in_the_United_States_A_Retrospective_D","314571006_RDF-SQ_Mixing_Parallel_and_Sequential_Computation_for_Top-Down_OWL_RL_Inference","314026268_Mining_social_semantics_on_the_social_web","308835013_Data_Fusion_Strategy_for_Precise_Vehicle_Location_for_Intelligent_Self-Aware_Maintenance_Systems","308731163_OWL_RDF_RDFS_inference_derivation_using_Jena_semantic_framework_pellet_reasoner","307910282_RDF_Query_and_Inference_in_Prolog","307853776_Additive_manufacturing_cloud_based_on_multi_agent_systems_and_rule_inference"]}
