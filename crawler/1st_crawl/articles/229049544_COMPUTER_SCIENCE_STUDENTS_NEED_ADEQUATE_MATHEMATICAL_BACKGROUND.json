{"id":"229049544_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_STUDENTS_NEED_ADEQUATE_MATHEMATICAL_BACKGROUND","abstract":"Computer science is a relatively young discipline. The first computer science instructors were mathematicians and the first CS curricula were just modifications of mathematics curricula. As computer science has grown and matured, and some of its fields became independent disciplines of their own, the role of mathematics in it has faded significantly. The number of mathematical courses in the CS curriculum naturally has been decreased. The amount of mathematics required for a computer science majors has become dangerously small -so small, that it is starting to jeopardize student's ability to learn, understand and appreciate fundamental theory of computer science. This paper is devoted to studying the influence of computer science students' insufficient mathematical background on their ability to learn, understand and appreciate theoretical courses of computer science, particularly the Theory of Computing.","authors":["Hasmik Gharibyan Paulson"],"meta":[],"references":["221538520_Computing_curricula_2001_how_will_it_work_for_you","221538259_Curriculum_2001_interim_report_from_the_ACMIEEE-CS_task_force","220425264_The_real_reason_why_software_engineers_need_math","2955262_What_knowledge_is_important_to_a_software_professional","243510601_Universities_aren't_serving_the_it_workforce","27294780_A_New_Answer_to_How_Important_is_Mathematics_to_the_Software_Practitioner"]}
