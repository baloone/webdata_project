{"id":"302301843_Partially_Ordered_Monads","abstract":"It is our intention to introduce a partially ordered monad as a monad T = (T, η µ) in a given base category C provided with the following additional properties:\nFor every C-object X the object T(X) is a partially ordered C -object.\nThe clone-composition-function is isotone in both variables.\nFor every C-object X the component µX\nof the multiplication µ has a left adjoint C-morphism.","authors":["Ulrich Höhle"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-1617-0_3","In book: Many Valued Topology and its Applications (pp.29-54)"],"references":[]}
