{"id":"338511298_GMM_A_generalized_mechanics_model_for_identifying_the_importance_of_nodes_in_complex_networks","abstract":"How to assess the importance of nodes in the network is an open question. There are many ways to identify the importance of nodes in complex networks. However, these methods have their own shortcomings and advantages. In particular, some methods based on the importance of nodes between interactions between nodes have been proposed. These methods utilize local information or path information. How to combine local and global information is still a problem. In this paper, a generalized mechanical model is proposed that uses global information and local information. To verify the effectiveness of the method, some experiments were performed on a total of ten real networks. In particular, an innovative experimental network-based quality assessment was proposed to validate the method of identifying the importance of nodes.","authors":["Fan Liu","Zhen Wang","Yong Deng"],"meta":["January 2020Knowledge-Based Systems 193(5, 2):105464","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105464"],"references":["335862664_Evidential_Decision_Tree_Based_on_Belief_Entropy","335571141_Optimizing_spreading_dynamics_in_interconnected_networks","335414598_Optimal_interlayer_structure_for_promoting_spreading_of_the_susceptible-infected-susceptible_model_in_two-layer_networks","334858283_Divergence_Measure_of_Belief_Function_and_Its_Application_in_Data_Fusion","334490137_A_New_Geometric_Mean_FMEA_Method_Based_on_Information_Quality","334287614_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Network_Forecasting_Time_Series","333686362_Identifying_influential_spreaders_by_gravity_model","329160693_Popularity_enhances_the_interdependent_network_reciprocity","325940849_Node_Importance_in_Controlled_Complex_Networks","321935609_Punishment_diminishes_the_benefits_of_network_reciprocity_in_social_dilemma_experiments","315696283_Onymity_promotes_cooperation_in_social_dilemma_experiments","307536753_Statistical_physics_of_vaccination","290522336_The_H-index_of_a_network_node_and_its_relation_to_degree_and_coreness","280537968_Coupled_disease-behavior_dynamics_on_complex_networks_A_review","260195943_Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking_in_Interdependent_Networked_Game","347786374_Node_importance_based_on_the_weighted_K-order_propagation_number_algorithm","337459691_Hypotheses_Analysis_and_Assessment_in_Counterterrorism_Activities_A_Method_Based_on_OWA_and_Fuzzy_Probabilistic_Rough_Sets","336726258_Fully_Distributed_Synchronization_of_Dynamic_Networked_Systems_With_Adaptive_Nonlinear_Couplings","336642651_An_association_coefficient_of_a_belief_function_and_its_application_in_a_target_recognition_system","336283805_Identification_of_influencers_in_complex_networks_by_local_information_dimensionality","336227675_Synchronization_in_Kuramoto_Oscillator_Networks_With_Sampled-Data_Updating_Law","334313260_A_discrete_shuffled_frog-leaping_algorithm_to_identify_influential_nodes_for_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","333468581_Identifying_node_importance_based_on_evidence_theory_in_complex_networks","331563438_The_effect_of_multigame_on_cooperation_in_spatial_network","330802759_Identifying_influential_nodes_based_on_fuzzy_local_dimension_in_complex_networks","330753932_Interconnecting_strategy_of_bridging_multilayer_networks_to_maximize_synchronizability","330691458_Self-organized_interdependence_among_populations_promotes_cooperation_by_means_of_coevolution","330403254_Random_walk_based_method_to_identify_essential_proteins_by_integrating_network_topology_and_biological_characteristics","329455366_Virus_Propagation_and_Patch_Distribution_in_Multiplex_Networks_Modeling_Analysis_and_Optimal_Allocation","329345014_A_novel_visibility_graph_transformation_of_time_series_into_weighted_networks","328527974_Influence_Factorization_for_identifying_authorities_in_Twitter","327054654_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_based_on_the_inverse-square_law","327004306_Entropic_methodology_for_entanglement_measures","322866229_An_immunization_based_on_node_activity","321215691_Identifying_Topical_Influencers_On_Twitter_Based_on_User_Behavior_and_Network_Topology","321188770_Improving_robustness_of_interdependent_networks_by_a_new_coupling_strategy","318917040_Local_Higher-Order_Graph_Clustering","315454683_Promoting_information_spreading_by_using_contact_memory","312333461_A_fractal_growth_model_Exploring_the_connection_pattern_of_hubs_in_complex_networks","311656318_Model_for_multi-messages_spreading_over_complex_networks_considering_the_relationship_between_messages","307638966_System_Crash_as_Dynamics_of_Complex_Networks","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","284025615_Rank_Correlation_Measures","283598027_Learning_to_discover_social_circles_in_ego_networks","261006482_Detecting_overlapping_communities_by_seed_community_in_weighted_complex_networks","260914256_Detecting_overlapping_communities_in_networks_using_the_maximal_sub-graph_and_the_clustering_coefficient","257391499_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_with_community_structure","257218854_Detecting_communities_by_the_core-vertex_and_intimate_degree_in_complex_networks","257191055_Reply_to_Comment_on_'Epidemic_spreading_on_heterogeneous_networks_with_identical_infectivity'_Phys_Lett_A_364_2007_189_Phys_Lett_A_372_2008_1722","250428492_Laws_of_Graph_Evolution_Densiflcation_and_Shrinking_Diameters","231040944_Catastrophes_in_Scale-Free_Networks","241095373_A_modified_SIS_model_with_an_infective_medium_on_complex_networks_and_its_global_stability","228766359_The_Political_Blogosphere_and_the_2004_US_Election_Divided_They_Blog","222671188_A_Measure_of_Betweenness_Centrality_based_on_Random_Walks","222447730_Centrality_in_Social_Networks'_Conceptual_Clarification"]}
