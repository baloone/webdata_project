{"id":"274013468_Sticks_AND_Carrots_Encouraging_Open_Science_at_its_source","abstract":"The open science (OS) movement has been seen as an important facilitator for public participation in science. This has been underpinned by the assumption that widespread and free access to research outputs leads to (1) better and more efficient science, (2) economic growth, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises wishing to capitalise on research findings, and (3) increased transparency of knowledge production and its outcomes. The latter in particular could function as a catalyst for public participation and engagement. Whether OS is likely to help realise these benefits, however, will depend on the emergence of systemic incentives for scientists to utilise OS in a meaningful manner. While in some areas, the environmental sciences have a long tradition of open ethos, citizen inclusion and global collaborations, such activities need to be more systematically supported and promoted by funders and learned societies in order to improve scientific research and public participation.","authors":["Sabina Leonelli","Daniel Spichtinger","Barbara Prainsack"],"meta":["March 2015Geo Geography and Environment","DOI:10.1002/geo2.2"],"references":["271712328_European_Commission_Policy_on_Open-Access_to_Scientific_Publications_and_Research_Data_in_Horizon_2020","266381896_Science_as_an_Open_Enterprise","262008247_Big_Data_and_Human_Geography_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Risks","259883136_Raw_Personal_Data_Providing_Access","237713740_Rethinking_Maps","237088393_Why_the_Current_Insistence_on_Open_Access_to_Scientific_Data_Big_Data_Knowledge_Production_and_the_Political_Economy_of_Contemporary_Biology","233475586_Researching_Volunteered_Geographic_Information_Spatial_Data_Geographic_Research_and_New_Social_Practice","320748660_Geophysical_Datascapes_of_the_Cold_War_Politics_and_Practices_of_the_World_Data_Centers_in_the_1950s_and_1960s","260698410_Irreproducible_research","250004368_Big_Science_and_Big_Data_in_Biology_From_the_International_Geophysical_Year_Through_the_International_Biological_Program_to_the_Long_Term_Ecological_Research_LTER_Network_1957-Present"]}
