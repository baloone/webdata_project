{"id":"331931402_It's_not_all_about_autism_The_emerging_landscape_of_anti-vaccination_sentiment_on_Facebook","abstract":"Background: \nDue in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.\n\nMethods: \nOur data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's Îº ranged 0.71-1.0 after double-coding.\n\nResults: \nThe majority (89%) of individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as \"trust,\" \"alternatives,\" \"safety,\" and \"conspiracy.\" For example, a comment representative of \"conspiracy\" is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the \"alternatives\" sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water fluoridation and circumcision.\n\nConclusions: \nSocial media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, targeted messages to different constituencies.","authors":["Beth Hoffman","Elizabeth Madison Felter","Kar-Hai Chu","Ariel Shensa"],"meta":["March 2019Vaccine 37(16)","DOI:10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.003"],"references":["322355161_Polarization_of_the_Vaccination_Debate_on_Facebook","322085792_Mapping_the_anti-vaccination_movement_on_Facebook","321492173_Association_of_moral_values_with_vaccine_hesitancy","320506950_Observation_of_public_sentiment_toward_human_papillomavirus_vaccination_on_Twitter","316591015_Mapping_information_exposure_on_social_media_to_explain_differences_in_HPV_vaccine_coverage_in_the_United_States","309330339_Vaccine_impact_Benefits_for_human_health","305878326_Social_media_as_a_platform_for_health-related_public_debates_and_discussions_The_Polio_vaccine_on_Facebook","303214441_Gephi_An_Open_Source_Software_for_Exploring_and_Manipulating_Networks","266626920_Using_Visualizations_to_Explore_Network_Dynamics","260485891_Effective_Messages_in_Vaccine_Promotion_A_Randomized_Trial","260485890_Economic_Evaluation_of_the_Routine_Childhood_Immunization_Program_in_the_United_States_2009","236327697_A_New_Dimension_of_Health_Care_Systematic_Review_of_the_Uses_Benefits_and_Limitations_of_Social_Media_for_Health_Communication","230883949_Vaccination_Policies_and_Rates_of_Exemption_from_Immunization_2005-2011","216637282_A_Set_of_Measures_of_Centrality_Based_on_Betweenness","42611066_The_Influence_of_Vaccine-critical_Websites_on_Perceiving_Vaccination_Risks","23806774_Denialism_What_is_it_and_how_should_scientists_respond","328948094_Addressing_Health-Related_Misinformation_on_Social_Media","325930610_Toward_Real-Time_Infoveillance_of_Twitter_Health_Messages","325765427_Parents'_Views_on_the_Best_and_Worst_Reasons_for_Guideline-Consistent_HPV_Vaccination","322877835_The_Psychological_Roots_of_Anti-Vaccination_Attitudes_A_24-Nation_Investigation","322600891_Ethical_Issues_in_Social_Media_Research_for_Public_Health","315611958_Exposure_to_fictional_medical_television_and_health_A_systematic_review","308927232_A_comparison_of_language_use_in_pro-_and_anti-vaccination_comments_in_response_to_a_high_profile_Facebook_post","298328552_The_impact_of_the_web_and_social_networks_on_vaccination_New_challenges_and_opportunities_offered_to_fight_against_vaccine_hesitancy","289489131_Toward_Effective_Water_Pipe_Tobacco_Control_Policy_in_the_United_States_Synthesis_of_Federal_State_and_Local_Policy_Texts","276935485_Media_Education_Literacy_Learning_and_Contemporary_Culture","272247196_Vaccine_Risk_Perceptions_and_Ad_Hoc_Risk_Communication_An_Empirical_Assessment","272224580_Content_and_Design_Attributes_of_Antivaccination_Web_Sites","257350306_Social_Factors_in_Epidemiology","227708042_The_Burden_of_Disease_and_the_Changing_Task_of_Medicine","227628976_Reliability_in_Content_Analysis","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","221862148_Opportunities_and_challenges_of_Web_20_for_vaccination_decisions","51992843_Social_Network_Analysis_Methods_and_Applications","51882509_Anti-vaccine_activists_Web_20_and_the_postmodern_paradigm_-_An_overview_of_tactics_and_tropes_used_online_by_the_anti-vaccination_movement","51777562_Lessons_from_an_online_debate_about_measles-mumps-rubella_MMR_immunization","44828585_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Techniques_And_Procedures_For_Developing_Grounded_Theory","6264761_The_pertussis_vaccine_controversy_in_Great_Britain_1974-1986"]}
