{"id":"319480685_A_Review_of_Pedestrian_Indoor_Positioning_Systems_for_Mass_Market_Applications","abstract":"In the last decade, the interest in Indoor Location Based Services (ILBS) has increased stimulating the development of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). In particular, ILBS look for positioning systems that can be applied anywhere in the world for millions of users, that is, there is a need for developing IPS for mass market applications. Those systems must provide accurate position estimations with minimum infrastructure cost and easy scalability to different environments. This survey overviews the current state of the art of IPSs and classifies them in terms of the infrastructure and methodology employed. Finally, each group is reviewed analysing its advantages and disadvantages and its applicability to mass market applications.","authors":["Alejandro Correa Vila","Marc Barcel√≥","Antoni Morell","Jose Lopez Vicario"],"meta":["August 2017Sensors 17(8)","DOI:10.3390/s17081927"],"references":["317057817_Efficient_Sequence_Matching_and_Path_Construction_for_Geomagnetic_Indoor_Localization","309955158_Advanced_Pedestrian_Positioning_System_to_Smartphones_and_Smartwatches","322276986_Tilt_sensing_using_a_three-axis_accelerometer","317394445_Accurate_indoor_localization_and_tracking_using_mobile_phone_inertial_sensors_WiFi_and_iBeacon","309283547_Modern_WLAN_Fingerprinting_Indoor_Positioning_Methods_and_Deployment_Challenges","309082030_Vehicle_Positioning_Using_5G_Millimeter-Wave_Systems","308855590_PocketSLAM_based_on_the_principle_of_the_FootSLAM_algorithm","308813705_A_mobile_indoor_positioning_system_based_on_iBeacon_technology","306127011_Performance_Evaluation_of_Radio_Map_Construction_Methods_for_Wi-Fi_Positioning_Systems","303890632_Smartphone_Inertial_Sensor_Based_Indoor_Localization_and_Tracking_with_iBeacon_Corrections"]}
