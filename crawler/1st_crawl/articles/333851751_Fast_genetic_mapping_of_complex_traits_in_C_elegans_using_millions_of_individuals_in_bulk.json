{"id":"333851751_Fast_genetic_mapping_of_complex_traits_in_C_elegans_using_millions_of_individuals_in_bulk","abstract":"Genetic studies of complex traits in animals have been hindered by the need to generate, maintain, and phenotype large panels of recombinant lines. We developed a new method, C. elegans eXtreme Quantitative Trait Locus (ceX-QTL) mapping, that overcomes this obstacle via bulk selection on millions of unique recombinant individuals. We use ceX-QTL to map a drug resistance locus with high resolution. We also map differences in gene expression in live worms and discovered that mutations in the co-chaperone sti-1 upregulate the transcription of HSP-90. Lastly, we use ceX-QTL to map loci that influence fitness genome-wide confirming previously reported causal variants and uncovering new fitness loci. ceX-QTL is fast, powerful and cost-effective, and will accelerate the study of complex traits in animals.","authors":["Alejandro Burga","Eyal Ben-David","Tzitziki Lemus Vergara","James Boocock"],"meta":["June 2019Nature Communications 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-10636-9"],"references":["321370614_Maternal_age_generates_phenotypic_variation_in_Caenorhabditis_elegans","320606128_Polygenicity_and_Epistasis_Underlie_Fitness-Proximal_Traits_in_the_Caenorhabditis_elegans_Multiparental_Experimental_Evolution_CeMEE_Panel","317391468_Experimental_Evolution_with_Caenorhabditis_Nematodes","316319326_The_genetic_basis_of_parental_care_evolution_in_monogamous_mice","310828262_CeNDR_the_Caenorhabditis_elegans_natural_diversity_resource","308757441_E2F_coregulates_an_essential_HSF_developmental_program_that_is_distinct_from_the_heat-shock_response","308488138_Genetic_Mapping_by_Bulk_Segregant_Analysis_in_Drosophila_Experimental_Design_and_Simulation-Based_Inference","307718907_Correction_Reproductive_Mode_and_the_Evolution_of_Genome_Size_and_Structure_in_Caenorhabditis_Nematodes","321587645_The_HSP90_chaperone_machinery","316287860_Transgenerational_transmission_of_environmental_information_in_C_elegans"]}
