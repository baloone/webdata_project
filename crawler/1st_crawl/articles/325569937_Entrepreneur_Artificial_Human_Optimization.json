{"id":"325569937_Entrepreneur_Artificial_Human_Optimization","abstract":"A new field titled 'Artificial Human Optimization' is introduced in this paper. All optimization methods which were proposed based on Artificial Humans will come under this new field. Less than 20 papers were published in this field so far. The goal of this paper is to introduce 'Artificial Human Optimization' and to show abstracts of papers published in this new field. The nick name given to this work is 'ENTREPRENEUR'.","authors":["Satish Gajawada"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.14738/tmlai.46.2408","Project: Artificial Human Optimization"],"references":["301939999_Human_behavior-based_optimization_a_novel_metaheuristic_approach_to_solve_complex_optimization_problems","280104094_Human_Behavior_Algorithms_for_Highly_Efficient_Global_Optimization","277176708_ASBO_BASED_COMPOSITIONAL_OPTIMIZATION_IN_COMBINATORIAL_CATALYST","269303087_Human_cognition_inspired_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","263661408_PID_Controller_Auto_Tuning_using_ASBO_Technique","261704446_Human_Behavior-Based_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","284133706_Improved_SRPSO_algorithm_for_solving_CEC_2015_computationally_expensive_numerical_optimization_problems","274314631_Human_meta-cognition_inspired_collaborative_search_algorithm_for_optimization","272392098_Modification_of_particle_swarm_optimization_with_human_simulated_property","267572609_Self_regulating_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","240918269_Clustering_of_Text_Document_based_on_ASBO"]}
