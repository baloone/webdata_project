{"id":"340947617_An_Automated_Flow_Chemistry_Platform_to_Decouple_Mixing_and_Reaction_Times","abstract":"Although a vital parameter in many colloidal nanomaterial syntheses, precursor mixing rates are typically inconsistent in batch processes and difficult to separate from reaction time in continuous flow systems. Here, we present a flow chemistry platform that decouples early-stage precursor mixing rates from reaction time (residence time) using solely off-the-shelf, commercially available and standard dimension components. We then utilize the developed flow chemistry platform towards time- and material-efficient studies of mass transfer-controlled synthesis of cesium lead bromide perovskite quantum dots.","authors":["Robert W Epps","Amanda A Volk","Kameel Abdel-Latif","Milad Abolhasani"],"meta":["April 2020Reaction Chemistry & Engineering 5(7)","DOI:10.1039/D0RE00129E"],"references":["331776119_Facile_Room-Temperature_Anion_Exchange_Reactions_of_Inorganic_Perovskite_Quantum_Dots_Enabled_by_a_Modular_Microfluidic_Platform","326483345_Thermoformed_fluoropolymer_tubing_for_in-line_mixing","325185637_Pick_a_Color_MARIA_Adaptive_Sampling_Enables_the_Rapid_Identification_of_Complex_Perovskite_Nanocrystal_Compositions_with_Defined_Emission_Characteristics","324806395_Numerical_and_Experimental_Study_on_Mixing_Performances_of_Simple_and_Vortex_Micro_T-Mixers","319633951_A_Review_on_Micromixers","275053853_Oscillatory_three-phase_flow_reactor_for_studies_of_bi-phasic_catalytic_reactions","258039343_The_past_present_and_potential_for_microfluidic_reactor_technology_in_chemical_synthesis","255773661_Large-scale_synthesis_of_nanocrystals_in_a_multichannel_droplet_reactor","253338442_An_acoustofluidic_micromixer_based_on_oscillating_sidewall_sharp-edges","230622686_Iterative_operations_on_microdroplets_and_continuous_monitoring_of_processes_within_them_determination_of_solubility_diagrams","41548882_Synthesis_of_micro_and_nanostructures_in_microfluidic_systems","11549357_Chaotic_Mixer_for_Microchannels","8439346_Transport_and_reaction_in_microscale_segmented_gas-liquid_flow","3329312_Passive_Mixing_in_a_Three-Dimensional_Serpentine_Microchannel","340111804_Reaction_Cycling_for_Kinetic_Analysis_in_Flow","332660692_A_low-cost_non-invasive_phase_velocity_and_length_meter_and_controller_for_multiphase_lab-in-a-tube_devices","326167510_Flow_Chemistry-Enabled_Studies_of_Rhodium-Catalyzed_Hydroformylation_Reactions","325323318_On_the_Light_Absorption_Coefficient_of_CsPbBr_3_Perovskite_Nanocrystals","320477125_Automated_Microfluidic_Platform_for_Systematic_Studies_of_Colloidal_Perovskite_Nanocrystals_Towards_Continuous_Nano-Manufacturing","305211686_Oscillatory_multiphase_flow_strategy_for_chemistry_and_biology","301901017_Room-Temperature_and_Gram-Scale_Synthesis_of_CsPbX3_XCl_Br_I_Perovskite_Nanocrystals_with_50-85_Photoluminescence_Quantum_Yields","291341852_Highly_Dynamic_Ligand_Binding_and_Light_Absorption_Coefficient_of_Cesium_Lead_Bromide_Perovskite_Nanocrystals","281440163_Peclet_Number_Dependence_of_Mass_Transfer_in_Microscale_Segmented_Gas-Liquid_Flow","281275587_Oscillatory_Microprocessor_for_Growth_and_in_Situ_Characterization_of_Semiconductor_Nanocrystals","276365218_Numerical_Characterization_of_Simple_Three-Dimensional_Chaotic_Micromixers","271592916_Nanocrystals_of_Cesium_Lead_Halide_Perovskites_CsPbX_3_X_Cl_Br_and_I_Novel_Optoelectronic_Materials_Showing_Bright_Emission_with_Wide_Color_Gamut","257565373_Mass_transfer_performance_of_gas-liquid_segmented_flow_in_microchannels","241951917_Viscosity_of_liquid_toluene_at_temperature_from_25_to_150_degrees_C_and_at_pressures_up_to_30_MPa","236327274_A_Fully_Unsupervised_Compartment-on-Demand_Platform_for_Precise_Nanoliter_Assays_of_Time-Dependent_Steady-State_Enzyme_Kinetics_and_Inhibition","231675225_Formation_of_Droplets_and_Mixing_in_Multiphase_Microfluidics_at_Low_Value_of_the_Reynolds_and_Capillary_Number","231488339_The_Diffusion_Coefficients_of_Sodium_and_Potassium_Iodides_in_Aqueous_Solution_at_251","52009778_Micromixers-A_Review_on_Passive_and_Active_Mixing_Principles","45268570_Integrated_Microreactors_for_Reaction_Automation_New_Approaches_to_Reaction_Development","9002039_Millisecond_Kinetics_on_a_Microfluidic_Chip_Using_Nanoliters_of_Reagents","7777424_A_Microfabricated_Gas-Liquid_Segmented_Flow_Reactor_for_High-Temperature_Synthesis_The_Case_of_CdSe_Quantum_Dots","5904184_Experimental_test_of_scaling_of_mixing_by_chaotic_advection_in_droplets_moving_through_microfluidic_channels","5318725_ChemInform_Abstract_Flash_Chemistry_Fast_Chemical_Synthesis_by_Using_Microreactors"]}
