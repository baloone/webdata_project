{"id":"330063004_Empirical_studies_to_investigate_the_usability_of_text-_and_image-based_CAPTCHAs","abstract":"This article reports the findings of two empirical studies investigating the usability of image-based and text-based CAPTCHAs that authenticate users accessing the web. The first investigated four image-based CAPTCHAs, Asirra, ESP-PIX, SQ-PIX and IMAGINATION, with twenty participants interacting with five of each type on a desktop computer. The participants then completed the computer system usability questionnaire (CSUQ), the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and a final post-test subjective questionnaire ranking the CAPTCHAs based on preference. The results found statistically significant differences among the CAPTCHAs for all dependent variables except task completion time, with participants preferring Asirra and ESP-PIX. The second compared the usability of these two with the two most commonly used text-based CAPTCHAs, ReCAPTCHA and Google's CAPTCHA. After receiving training on Asirra and ESP-PIX, twenty-four participants completed 10 trials with each type on a desktop computer, subsequently completing the CSUQ and the NASA-TLX followed by a retrospective think-aloud session. The results of this second study indicated that Google's CAPTCHA and ReCAPTCHA took the least amount of time to complete. The workload associated with Asirra and ReCAPTCHA was lower than that for ESP-PIX and Google's CAPTCHA. Perceived overall usability tended to be highest for Asirra and ReCAPTCHA. Participant comments indicated that Google's CAPTCHA was too visually distorted and ESP-PIX had commonalities between the images that weren't immediately obvious, factors perhaps contributing to their lower perceived usability scores. Overall, ReCAPTCHA is recommended for use on a desktop computer because of its high perceived usability, low completion time, and low workload.","authors":["Kapil Chalil Madathil","Joel S.
