{"id":"349314109_Multi-dimensional_database_technology_based_on_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"Artificial intelligence and database technology are both important fields of computer science. The research results show that more and more industries have a growing demand for artificial intelligence and database. The combination of these two technologies will certainly bring a broader prospect to computer application. This paper mainly discusses the necessity, importance and development of multi-dimensional database technology based on artificial intelligence, introduces the combination strategy of artificial intelligence and multidimensional database and the current research field, and gives the research direction.","authors":["Yurong Liu","Yang Bai","Xiongjun Li","Hao Chen"],"meta":["January 2021MATEC Web of Conferences 336:05001","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/202133605001"],"references":[]}
