{"id":"303756787_Methodologies_for_the_creation_of_semantic_data","abstract":"This chapter is meant as an overview of the current state of the art in the area of knowledge engineering, with a particular focus on the methodologies describing how the process of creating ontologies and, more general, semantic content, should be performed in a rigorous and controlled manner. We introduce the most important methodologies proposed in the past years in this field, and the tool environments supporting their application. As a result of this survey we identify open issues and possible directions of research and development which are likely to lead to a mainstream adoption of the methodologies, and thus encourage the industrial takeup of semantic technologies. © 2014 by World Scientific Publishing Co.
