{"id":"274318996_Improvements_of_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"Based on the improvements of the original DV-Hop localization algorithm, three new localization algorithms (iDV-Hop1, iDV-Hop2, and Quad DV-Hop) are presented in this article. In iDV-Hop1 and iDV-Hop2, all steps of the original DV-Hop are kept, and several steps based on geometry improvements of the localization problem are added in order to obtain better localization accuracy. The third algorithm (Quad DV-Hop) formulated the localization problem as bounded least squares problem, to be solved by quadratic programming. Simulations are carried out on the four different types of network topology by varying nodes communication range, number of anchor nodes and number of nodes. Comparison of our algorithms with the original DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop algorithms are given. It is shown that iDV-Hop1 algorithm can significantly reduce the localization error (up to three times) in scenarios with irregular topologies compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop. In scenarios with regular topologies, iDV-Hop2 and Quad DV-Hop showed better performance compared to DV-Hop and Improved DV-Hop (up to 11 % lower localization error).","authors":["Stefan Tomic","Ivan Mezei"],"meta":["March 2015Telecommunication Systems 61(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11235-015-0014-9"],"references":["265129629_Improvement_of_Range-free_Localization_Technology_by_a_Novel_DV-hop_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","258396287_Range-Free_Localization_Scheme_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_Bilateration","258050271_Improvement_over_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","272963659_A_localization_algorithm_based_on_SFLA_and_PSO_for_wireless_sensor_network","261599495_The_Impacts_of_Mobility_Models_on_DV-hop_Based_Localization_in_Mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261351206_Improved_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","261269713_MobiL_A_3-dimensional_localization_scheme_for_Mobile_Underwater_Sensor_Networks","261083008_An_improved_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","260667561_A_Range-Based_Localization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","260439119_A_collaborative_positioning_algorithm_for_mobile_target_using_multisensor_data_integration_in_enclosed_environments","239279031_Optimum_transmission_radii_in_packet_radio_networks_or_why_six_is_a_magic_number","232655171_A_Smart_Gateway_for_Health_Care_System_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Network","232630792_Energy_Efficient_Sensor_Network_with_Service_Discovery_for_Smart_Home_Environments","232623408_An_Improved_DV-Hop_Positioning_Algorithm_with_Modified_Distance_Error_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network","229058134_Convex_Optimization"]}
