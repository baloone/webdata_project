{"id":"280561781_Linear_Nested_Sequents_2-Sequents_and_Hypersequents","abstract":"We introduce the framework of linear nested sequent calculi by restricting nested sequents to linear structures. We show the close connection between this framework and that of 2-sequents, and provide linear nested sequent calculi for a number of modal logics as well as for intuitionistic logic. Furthermore, we explore connections to backwards proof search for sequent calculi and to the hypersequent framework, including a reinterpretation of various hypersequent calculi for modal logic S5 in the linear nested sequent framework.","authors":["Bj√∂rn Lellmann"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24312-2_10","Conference: TABLEAUX 2015"],"references":["267111975_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Logics","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","344486660_Modal_Logic","312657216_Uniform_cut-free_formulations_of_T_S4_and_S5_abstract","303412263_Non-commutative_classical_arithmetical_sequent_calculi_are_intuitionistic","302375046_The_Writing_of_Introduction_to_Metamathematics","281886444_Label-free_Modular_Systems_for_Classical_and_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","270150099_IMM_Introduction_to_metamathematics","267130589_Gentzen_Calculi_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic","267019441_Proofnets_for_S5_sequents_and_circuits_for_modal_logic"]}
