{"id":"225620676_Typed_Monoids_-_An_Eilenberg-Like_Theorem_for_Non_Regular_Languages","abstract":"Based on different concepts to obtain a finer notion of language recognition via finite monoids we develop an algebraic structure\ncalled typed monoid. This leads to an algebraic description of regular and non regular languages.\n\nWe obtain for each language a unique minimal recognizing typed monoid, the typed syntactic monoid. We prove an Eilenberg-like\ntheorem for varieties of typed monoids as well as a similar correspondence for classes of languages with weaker closure properties\nthan varieties.","authors":["Christoph Behle","Andreas Krebs","Stephanie Reifferscheid"],"meta":["June 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-21493-6_6","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Algebraic informatics"],"references":["226393833_Characterizing_TC0_in_Terms_of_Infinite_Groups","41714770_Some_results_on_C-varieties","2699144_Algebraic_and_Topological_Theory_of_Languages","1960611_Logic_Meets_Algebra_the_Case_of_Regular_Languages","344485184_Varieties_of_Formal_Languages","268492136_Finite_Semigroups_and_Universal_Algebra","267003070_Counter-free_automata_With_an_appendix_by_William_Henneman","266434295_Varieties_of_formal_languages_Transl_from_the_French_by_A_Howie","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","256270034_The_kernel_of_monoid_morphisms","245661694_Circuits_and_the_polynomial_time_hierarchy","242947601_Finite_semigroups_and_universal_algebra","242529690_Automata_Languages_and_Machines","242104244_On_Uniformity_within_NC","234798109_Varieties_Of_Formal_Languages","228558368_A_variety_theorem_without_complementation","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","222462961_A_logic_for_constant-depth_circuits","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","220976756_An_Algebraic_Framework_for_the_Study_of_the_Syntactic_Monoids_Application_to_the_Group_Languages","220975939_Linear_Circuits_Two-Variable_Logic_and_Weakly_Blocked_Monoids","220394210_First-Order_Definability_on_Finite_Structures","220249059_Non-Uniform_Automata_Over_Groups","41701215_Regular_Languages_Definable_by_Lindstrom_Quantifiers","30832783_Regular_languages_in_NC1","2728882_Languages_That_Capture_Complexity_Classes"]}
