{"id":"269182040_High_speed_and_adaptable_error_correction_for_megabits_rate_quantum_key_distribution","abstract":"Quantum Key Distribution is moving from its theoretical foundation of unconditional security to rapidly approaching real world installations. A significant part of this move is the orders of magnitude increases in the rate at which secure key bits are distributed. However, these advances have mostly been confined to the physical hardware stage of QKD, with software post-processing often being unable to support the high raw bit rates. In a complete implementation this leads to a bottleneck limiting the final secure key rate of the system unnecessarily. Here we report details of equally high rate error correction which is further adaptable to maximise the secure key rate under a range of different operating conditions. The error correction is implemented both in CPU and GPU using a bi-directional LDPC approach and can provide 90-94% of the ideal secure key rate over all fibre distances from 0-80 km.","authors":["Alexander R Dixon","H Sato"],"meta":["December 2014Scientific Reports 4(1):7275","DOI:10.1038/srep07275","SourcePubMed"],"references":["258036373_Efficient_decoy-state_quantum_key_distribution_with_quantified_security","256477483_A_fast_and_versatile_QKD_system_with_hardware_key_distillation_and_wavelength_multiplexing","236739748_High-speed_free-space_quantum_key_distribution_system_for_urban_daylight_applications","236097619_Key_Reconciliation_for_High_Performance_Quantum_Key_Distribution","234015166_Simultaneous_transmission_of_20x2_WDMSCM-QKD_and_4_bidirectional_classical_channels_over_a_PON","233815394_Coexistence_of_High-Bit-Rate_Quantum_Key_Distribution_and_Data_on_Optical_Fiber","291208043_Secret-key_reconciliation_by_public_discussion","284716431_A_fast_and_versatile_QKD_system_with_hardware_key_distillation_and_wavelength_multiplexing","258083735_Estimating_Channel_Parameters_from_the_Syndrome_of_a_Linear_Code","253330010_High_Performance_Information_Reconciliation_for_QKD_with_CASCADE"]}
