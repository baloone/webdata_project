{"id":"343202849_Development_of_tunnel_intelligent_monitoring_and_early_warning_system_based_on_micro-service_architecture_the_case_of_AnPing_tunnel","abstract":"Along with the development of computer science and communication techniques, tunnel monitoring has been digital and intellectualized gradually. In recent years, traditional tunnel monitoring systems have been becoming powerless to deal with huge amounts of data as the number of tunnels and monitoring sensors surge. In this study, an innovative and comprehensive intelligent tunnel monitoring system was designed based on micro-service architecture. Various function modules were distributed to multiple service instances to get the computing pressure decentralized. The system offered powerful massive data processing support, flexibility, and extensibility. For a certain tunnel, the system could acquire the monitoring data in real-time using wireless sensors deployed on its surface. When data reached the early warning threshold, the system would immediately transmit the warning message to users. Besides, an app was developed to offer support for wireless communication between the monitoring apparatus and watchers. The application of the Anping case, one of the monitoring targets, proved the high efficiency of data transmitting and effective emergency response of the developed system. The results indicated that the microservice architecture could facilitate algorithm development, decentralize calculation pressure, and promote the service capacity by decoupling components and distributing loads.","authors":["Qi Liu","Guangyin Lu","Junrong Huang","Dongxin Bai"],"meta":["January 2020Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk 11(1):1404-1425","DOI:10.1080/19475705.2020.1797906","Project: landslide monitoring"],"references":["346056905_Investigating_Toppling_Failure_Mechanism_of_Anti-dip_Layered_Slope_due_to_Excavation_by_Physical_Modelling","342291827_Impacts_of_Pore-Throat_System_on_Fractal_Characterization_of_Tight_Sandstones","340657997_Investigation_on_the_Failure_Characteristics_and_Fracture_Classification_of_Shale_Under_Brazilian_Test_Conditions","340610770_Scale_effect_of_mechanical_properties_of_jointed_rock_mass_A_numerical_study_based_on_particle_flow_code","340310434_Microscopic_Pore_Structure_of_Surrounding_Rock_for_Underground_Strategic_Petroleum_Reserve_SPR_Caverns_in_Bedded_Rock_Salt","339606551_Observe_the_temporal_evolution_of_deep_tunnel's_3D_deformation_by_3D_laser_scanning_in_the_Jinchuan_No_2_Mine","344631674_An_associated_evaluation_methodology_of_initial_stress_level_of_coal-rock_masses_in_steeply_inclined_coal_seams_Urumchi_coal_field_China","341586110_Performance_Comparison_of_Novel_Chemical_Agents_for_Mitigating_Water-Blocking_Problem_in_Tight_Gas_Sandstones","340355139_Smart_safety_early_warning_system_of_coal_mine_production_based_on_WSNs","340109493_The_application_of_short-wall_block_backfill_mining_to_preserve_surface_water_resources_in_northwest_China"]}
