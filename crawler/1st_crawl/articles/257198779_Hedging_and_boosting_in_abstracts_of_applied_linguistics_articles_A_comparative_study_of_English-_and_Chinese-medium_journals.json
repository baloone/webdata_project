{"id":"257198779_Hedging_and_boosting_in_abstracts_of_applied_linguistics_articles_A_comparative_study_of_English-_and_Chinese-medium_journals","abstract":"Hedges and boosters are important metadiscursive resources for writers to mark their epistemic stance and position writer–reader relations. Building on previous research that suggests notable cross-cultural and cross-linguistic differences in the use of hedges and boosters in academic discourse, this comparative study investigates the use of such discourse markers in academic article abstracts. Based on a corpus of 649 abstracts collected from 8 journals of applied linguistics, this study examines if hedging and boosting strategies differ (a) between applied linguists publishing in Chinese- and English-medium journals and (b) between authors of empirical and non-empirical academic articles. Quantitative analyses indicated that abstracts published in English-medium journals featured markedly more hedges than those published in Chinese-medium journals and that abstracts of empirical research articles used significantly more boosters than those of non-empirical academic articles. Textual analyses further revealed that the distinct patterning of hedges and boosters in Chinese and English abstracts had a joint, interactive effect on the authorial certainty and confidence conveyed therein. These results are discussed in terms of culturally preferred rhetorical strategies, epistemological beliefs, lack of facility in English as a second/foreign language, and the nature of supporting evidence drawn on for knowledge claims in different types of academic writing.","authors":["Guangwei Hu","Feng Cao"],"meta":["September 2011Journal of Pragmatics 43(11):2795–2809","DOI:10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.007"],"references":["291216095_Epistemic_and_approximative_meaning_revisited_the_use_of_hedges_boosters_and_approximators_when_writing_research_in_different_disciplines","250975745_A_framework_for_comparing_evaluation_resources_across_academic_texts","346379141_Academic_Voices_Across_languages_and_disciplines","324351412_Chinese_Thought_Society_and_Science_The_Intellectual_and_Social_Background_of_Science_and_Technology_in_Pre-modern_China","313771930_The_Choice_and_Use_of_Epistemic_Modality_Markers_in_Linguistics_and_Medical_Research_Articles","304549880_Linguistic_resources_as_evaluators_in_English_and_Chinese_research_articles","292667712_Hedging_Inflating_and_Persuading_in_L2_Academic_Writing","292259459_Polyphony_and_bibliographical_references","291167752_Qingtai_dongci_mohu_yuyan_yu_yingyu_xueshu_lunwen_xiezuo_fengge","290990778_Author_identity_in_economics_and_linguistics_abstracts","286773254_Tertium_comparationis_A_vital_component_in_contrastive_rhetoric_research","278112298_Learning_considered_within_a_cultural_context_-_Confucian_and_Socratic_approaches","275807553_Shaping_Written_Knowledge_The_Genre_and_the_Activity_of_the_Experimental_Article_in_Science","275689251_Boosting_hedging_and_the_negotiation_of_academic_knowledge","272923710_Contrastive_Rhetoric_An_American_Writing_Teacher_in_China","270914991_The_textual_organization_of_research_paper_abstracts_in_applied_linguistics","270304489_Contrastive_Rhetoric_Cross-Cultural_Aspects_of_Second-Language_Writing","270200524_Scientism_and_Humanism_Two_Cultures_in_Post-Mao_China_1978-1989","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","269958062_Science_and_Civilization_in_China","269866061_Genre_Knowledge_in_Disciplinary_Communication_CognitionCulturePower","264677414_Attitudes_of_Journal_Editors_to_Nonnative_Speaker_Contributions","264381455_Publication_Culture_of_Foreign_Language_Education_Journals_in_China","264226501_The_Challenge_of_Academic_Publishing_A_Hong_Kong_Perspective","263141969_Politeness_Some_Universals_in_Language_Usage","262966780_The_Sage_Handbook_of_Qualitative_Research","261691842_Computers_Scientism_and_Cyborg_Subjectivity_in_Postsocialist_China","259884212_THE_MITIGATION_OF_SCIENTIFIC_CLAIMS_IN_RESEARCH_PAPERS_A_COMPARATIVE_STUDY","257273848_A_text-type_and_move_analysis_study_of_verb_tense_and_modality_distribution_in_medical_English_abstracts","257198719_Promotion_and_Politeness_Conflicting_Scholarly_Rhetoric_in_Three_Disciplines_Ann-Charlotte_Lindeberg_Abo_Akademi_University_Press_Abo_2004_254_pages_26","255716483_Interpersonal_strategies_investigating_interlanguage_corpora_RELC_Journal_28_1_72-88_1997","254934717_Scientism_and_Humanism_Two_Cultures_in_Post-Mao_China_1978-1989_review","254904378_Politeness_Some_universals_in_language_usage_Japanese_translation","253132174_Persuasion_at_a_Distance_Book_Reviews_Shaping_Written_Knowledge_The_Genre_and_Activity_of_the_Experimental_Article_in_Science","250974752_The_rhetorical_management_of_academic_criticism_in_research_article_abstracts","249941178_Linguistic_resources_as_evaluators_in_English_and_Chinese_research_articles","249907325_Chinese_Thought_Society_and_Science_The_Intellectual_and_Social_Background_of_Science_and_Technology_in_Pre-Modern_China","249738714_Metadiscourse_in_Persuasive_Writing_A_Study_of_Texts_Written_by_American_and_Finnish_University_Students","249712762_Research_article_abstracts_in_applied_linguistics_and_educational_technology_A_study_of_linguistic_realizations_of_rhetorical_structure_and_authorial_stance","249712635_Stance_and_engagement_A_model_of_interaction_in_academic_discourse","249389343_Scientism_Technocracy_and_Morality_in_China","249237835_Doubt_and_Certainty_in_ESL_Textbooks","249199110_Scientism_in_Chinese_Thought_1900-1950","248451978_Pragmatic_markers_in_Chinese","248056274_The_Uses_of_Argument","247951750_The_Pragmatics_of_Politeness_in_Scientific_Articles","247584914_Some_Exploratory_Discourse_on_Metadiscourse","246363349_Hedging_in_Scientific_Research_Articles","246312539_Genre_Knowledge_in_Disciplinary_Communication","243775200_Knowledge_and_Human_Interest","243773803_Hedges_and_boosters_in_women's_and_men's_speech","242480333_Hedges_A_Study_in_Meaning_Criteria_and_the_Logic_of_Fuzzy_Concepts","240717586_Expressing_Doubt_and_Certainty_in_English","239559208_Linguistic_Cultural_and_Subcultural_Issues_in_Contrastive_Discoure_Analysis_Anglo-American_and_Chinese_Scientific_Texts","238750475_Analysing_genre_Language_use_in_professional_settings"]}
