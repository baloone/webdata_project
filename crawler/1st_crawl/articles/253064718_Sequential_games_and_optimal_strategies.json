{"id":"253064718_Sequential_games_and_optimal_strategies","abstract":"This article gives an overview of recent work on the theory of selection functions. We explain the intuition behind thes higher type objects, and define a general notion of sequential game whose optimal strategies can be computed via a certai product of selection functions. Several instances of this game are considered in a variety of areas such as fixed point theory topology, game theory, higher type computability and proof theory. These examples are intended to illustrate how the fundamenta construction of optimal strategies based on products of selection functions permeates several research areas.","authors":["Martin Escardo","Paulo Oliva"],"meta":["June 2011Proceedings of The Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 467(2130):1519-1545","DOI:10.1098/rspa.2010.0471"],"references":["281477937_Modified_bar_recursion_and_classical_dependent_choice","313514563_On_a_generalization_of_quantifiers","285379738_Godel's_functional_'dialectica'_interpretation","266435524_Algorithmic_game_theory_Foreword_by_Christos_H_Papadimitriou","266216415_The_continuous_functionals","265497993_Programming_languages_and_their_definition_Selected_papers_ed_by_C_B_Jones","258222947_Algorithmic_Game_Theory","251448921_Chapter_8_The_continuous_functionals","243784388_A_Model_for_Bar_Recursion_of_Higher_Types","243764471_Provably_recursive_functionals_of_analysis_A_consistency_proof_of_analysis_by_an_extension_of_principles_in_current_intuitionistic_mathematics"]}
