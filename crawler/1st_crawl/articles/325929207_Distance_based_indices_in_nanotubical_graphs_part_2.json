{"id":"325929207_Distance_based_indices_in_nanotubical_graphs_part_2","abstract":"Nanotubical graphs are obtained by wrapping a hexagonal grid, and then possibly\nclosing the tube with caps.\nIn this paper we show that the asymptotics for Balaban, Sum-Balaban, and\nHarary indices for all nanotubical graphs of type $(k,l)$ on $n$ vertices\nare $\\frac{9\\pi(k+l)}{2n}$, $\\frac{9\\sqrt 2}2\\sqrt{k+l}\\cdot\\log(1+\\sqrt 2)$\nand $(k+l)n\\log (n)$, respectively.\nIn all the cases, the leading term depends on the circumference of the\nnanotubical graph, but not on its specific type.\nThus, we conclude that these distance based topological indices seem not to\nbe the most suitable for distinguishing nanotubes with the same circumference\nas far as the leading term is concerned.","authors":["Vesna Andova","Martin Knor","Riste Å krekovski"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Mathematical Chemistry 56(10)","DOI:10.1007/s10910-018-0933-2"],"references":["325324525_Distance_based_indices_in_nanotubical_graphs_part_1","302964596_Distances_on_nanotubical_structures","282296103_Balaban_index_of_cubic_graphs","271843386_The_Harary_Index_of_a_Graph","313137668_The_maximum_Balaban_index_sum-Balaban_index_of_unicyclic_graphs","302429884_A_search_for_the_minimum_value_of_Balaban_index","296951350_Refutations_results_and_conjectures_about_the_Balaban_index","289599439_A_Comparison_Between_Various_Topological_Indices_Particularly_Between_the_Index_J_and_Wiener's_Index_W","282301987_Bounds_for_the_Sum-Balaban_index_and_revised_Szeged_index_of_regular_graphs","279139951_C60_Buckminsterfullerene","269109912_On_Diameter_of_Nanotubical_Fullerene_Graphs","253516227_Topological_Indices_Based_on_Topological_Distances_in_Molecular_Graph","266942256_On_the_Sum-Balaban_Index","265429911_Asymptotic_Values_of_Topological_Indices_J_and_J'_Average_Distance_Sum_Connectivities_for_Infinite_Acyclic_and_Cyclic_Graphs","253870847_Highly_Discriminating_Distance-Based_Topological_Index"]}
