{"id":"272521824_Projected_Reflected_Gradient_Methods_for_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","abstract":"This paper is concerned with some new projection methods for solving\nvariational inequality problems with monotone and Lipschitz-continuous mapping\nin Hilbert space. First, we propose the projected reflected gradient algorithm\nwith a constant stepsize. It is similar to the projected gradient method,\nnamely, the method requires only one projection onto the feasible set and only\none value of the mapping per iteration. This distinguishes our method from most\nother projection-type methods for variational inequalities with monotone\nmapping. Also we prove that it has R-linear rate of convergence under the\nstrong monotonicity assumption. The usual drawback of algorithms with constant\nstepsize is the requirement to know the Lipschitz constant of the mapping. To\navoid this, we modify our first algorithm so that the algorithm needs at most\ntwo projections per iteration. In fact, our computational experience shows that\nsuch cases with two projections are very rare. This scheme, at least\ntheoretically, seems to be very effective. All methods are shown to be globally\nconvergent to a solution of the variational inequality. Preliminary results\nfrom numerical experiments are quite promising.","authors":["Yura Malitsky"],"meta":["March 2015SIAM Journal on Optimization 25(1):502-520","DOI:10.1137/14097238X","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270761643_An_Extragradient_Algorithm_for_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","263734739_A_damped-Newton_method_for_the_linear_complementarity_problem","263048124_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Space","288324705_On_a_method_for_convex_programs_using_a_symmetrical_modification_of_the_Lagrange_function","275282752_Some_equation-based_methods_for_the_nonlinear_complementarity_problem","267149465_Application_Of_Khobotov's_Algorithm_To_Variational_Inequalities_And_Network_Equilibrium_Problems","266014652_A_Projection_and_Contraction_Method_for_the_Nonlinear_Complementarity_Problem_and_Its_Extensions","264960098_Nonlinear_functional_analysis_and_its_applications_III_Variational_methods_and_optimization_Transl_from_the_German_by_Leo_F_Boron","260245270_Equilibrium_Models_and_Variational_Inequalities","248304064_Variational_and_Quasivariational_Inequalities_Applications_to_Free_Boundary_Problems"]}
