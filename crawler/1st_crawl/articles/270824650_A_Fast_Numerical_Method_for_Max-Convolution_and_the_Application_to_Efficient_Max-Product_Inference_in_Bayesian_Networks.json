{"id":"270824650_A_Fast_Numerical_Method_for_Max-Convolution_and_the_Application_to_Efficient_Max-Product_Inference_in_Bayesian_Networks","abstract":"Observations depending on sums of random variables are common throughout many\nfields; however, no efficient solution is currently known for performing\nmax-product inference on these sums of general discrete distributions\n(max-product inference can be used to obtain maximum a posteriori estimates).\nThe limiting step to max-product inference is the max-convolution problem\n(sometimes presented in log-transformed form and denoted as \"infimal\nconvolution\", \"min-convolution\", or \"convolution on the tropical semiring\"),\nfor which no O(k log(k)) method is currently known. Here I present a O(k\nlog(k)) numerical method for estimating the max-convolution of two nonnegative\nvectors (e.g., two probability mass functions), where k is the length of the\nlarger vector. This numerical max-convolution method is then demonstrated by\nperforming fast max-product inference on a convolution tree, a data structure\nfor performing fast inference given information on the sum of n discrete random\nvariables in O(n k log(n k) log(n) ) steps (where each random variable has an\narbitrary prior distribution on k contiguous possible states). The numerical\nmax-convolution method can be applied to specialized classes of hidden Markov\nmodels to reduce the runtime of computing the Viterbi path from n k^2 to n k\nlog(k), and has potential application to the all-pairs shortest paths problem.","authors":["Oliver Serang"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Computational Biology: a Journal of Computational Molecular Cell Biology 22(8)","DOI:10.1089/cmb.2015.0013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260809184_The_Probabilistic_Convolution_Tree_Efficient_Exact_Bayesian_Inference_for_Faster_LC-MSMS_Protein_Inference","259441441_Faster_all-pairs_shortest_paths_via_circuit_complexity","234069890_A_Non-parametric_Cutout_Index_for_Robust_Evaluation_of_Identified_Proteins","233937333_Necklaces_Convolutions_and_XY","221859795_Serang_O_Mollinari_M_Garcia_AAF_Efficient_exact_maximum_a_posteriori_computation_forBayesian_SNP_genotyping_in_polyploids_PLoS_ONE_7_e30906","221530323_Shared_Peptides_in_Mass_Spectrometry_Based_Protein_Quantification","221345142_Efficient_inference_with_cardinality-based_clique_potentials","220320258_HOP-MAP_Efficient_message_passing_with_high_order_potentials","51088256_Discovering_Mercury_Protein_Modifications_in_Whole_Proteomes_Using_Natural_Isotope_Distributions_Observed_in_Liquid_Chromatography-Tandem_Mass_Spectrometry","50214790_Integrative_genomic_analysis_of_human_ribosomal_DNA","23808040_Efficient_yeast_ChIP-Seq_using_multiplex_short-read_DNA_sequencing","22518745_A_High-performance_Liquid_Chromatography_Method_for_Hemoglobin_A1c","262025765_Gas-Liquid_Partition_Chromatography_The_Separation_and_Micro-Estimation_of_Volatile_Fatty_Acids_from_Formic_Acid_to_Dodecanoic_Acid","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","242825663_The_QR_Transformation_A_Unitary_Analogue_to_the_LR_Transformation--Part_1","233410526_Recognizing_Uncertainty_Increases_Robustness_and_Reproducibility_of_Mass_Spectrometry-based_Protein_Inferences","230571081_A_review_of_statistical_methods_for_protein_identification_using_tandem_mass_spectrometry","222470079_Fast_algorithms_for_the_maximum_convolution_problem","222211576_An_Investigation_of_the_Mobility_Separation_of_some_Peptide_and_Protein_Ions_Using_a_New_Hybrid_QuadrupoleTravelling_Wave_IMSoa-ToF_Instrument","221830077_Faster_Mass_Spectrometry-Based_Protein_Inference_Junction_Trees_Are_More_Efficient_than_Sampling_and_Marginalization_by_Enumeration","220390607_Computing_rank-convolutions_with_a_mask","45658651_Efficient_Marginalization_to_Compute_Protein_Posterior_Probabilities_from_Shotgun_Mass_Spectrometry_Data","31281601_The_QR_transformation"]}
