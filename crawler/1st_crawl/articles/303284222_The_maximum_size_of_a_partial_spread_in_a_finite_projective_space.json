{"id":"303284222_The_maximum_size_of_a_partial_spread_in_a_finite_projective_space","abstract":"Let $n$ and $t$ be positive integers with $t<n$, and let $q$ be a prime power. A partial $(t-1)$-spread of ${\\rm PG}(n-1,q)$ is a set of $(t-1)$-dimensional subspaces of ${\\rm PG}(n-1,q)$ that are pairwise disjoint. Let $r=n\\mbox{ mod }t$. We prove that if $t>(q^r-1)/(q-1)$, then the maximum size, i.e., cardinality, of a partial $(t-1)$-spread of ${\\rm PG}(n-1,q)$ is $(q^n-q^{t+r})/(q^t-1)+1$. This essentially settles a main open problem in this area. Prior to this result, this maximum size was only known for $r\\in\\{0,1\\}$ and for $r=q=2$.","authors":["Esmeralda L.
