{"id":"261475105_On_the_Power_of_Homogeneous_Depth_4_Arithmetic_Circuits","abstract":"We prove exponential lower bounds on the size of homogeneous depth 4\narithmetic circuits computing an explicit polynomial in $VP$. Our results hold\nfor the {\\it Iterated Matrix Multiplication} polynomial - in particular we show\nthat any homogeneous depth 4 circuit computing the $(1,1)$ entry in the product\nof $n$ generic matrices of dimension $n^{O(1)}$ must have size\n$n^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$.\nOur results strengthen previous works in two significant ways.\nOur lower bounds hold for a polynomial in $VP$. Prior to our work, Kayal et\nal [KLSS14] proved an exponential lower bound for homogeneous depth 4 circuits\n(over fields of characteristic zero) computing a poly in $VNP$. The best known\nlower bounds for a depth 4 homogeneous circuit computing a poly in $VP$ was the\nbound of $n^{\\Omega(\\log n)}$ by [LSS, KLSS14].Our exponential lower bounds\nalso give the first exponential separation between general arithmetic circuits\nand homogeneous depth 4 arithmetic circuits. In particular they imply that the\ndepth reduction results of Koiran [Koi12] and Tavenas [Tav13] are tight even\nfor reductions to general homogeneous depth 4 circuits (without the restriction\nof bounded bottom fanin).\nOur lower bound holds over all fields. The lower bound of [KLSS14] worked\nonly over fields of characteristic zero. Prior to our work, the best lower\nbound for homogeneous depth 4 circuits over fields of positive characteristic\nwas $n^{\\Omega(\\log n)}$ [LSS, KLSS14].","authors":["Mrinal Kumar","Shubhangi Saraf"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2014.46","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256003160_Exponential_Complexity_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits_in_Algebras_of_Functions_over_Finite_Fields","330673386_Improved_bounds_for_reduction_to_depth_4_and_depth_3","314126289_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Homogeneous_Depth_Four_Arithmetic_Formulas","288310460_Super-polynomial_lower_bounds_for_depth-4_homogeneous_arithmetic_formulas","288305314_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Homogeneous_Depth_Four_Arithmetic_Formulas","288149370_A_super-polynomial_lower_bound_for_regular_arithmetic_formulas","282895174_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth-4_Formulas_Computing_Iterated_Matrix_Multiplication","261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","261054521_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Three","259528605_On_the_Limits_of_Depth_Reduction_at_Depth_3_Over_Small_Finite_Fields","259399872_Superpolynomial_Lower_Bounds_for_General_Homogeneous_Depth_4_Arithmetic_Circuits","258884473_The_Limits_of_Depth_Reduction_for_Arithmetic_Formulas_It's_All_About_the_Top_Fan-In","236248292_Improved_Bounds_for_Reduction_to_Depth_4_and_Depth_3","227297068_Fast_parallel_computation_of_polynomials_using_few_processors","226371574_Die_Berechnungskomplexitt_von_elementarsymmetrischen_Funktionen_und_von_Interpolationskoeffizienten","224354119_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","223124770_The_complexity_of_partial_derivatives","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra","220617287_Fast_Parallel_Computation_of_Polynomials_Using_Few_Processors","220295517_Elusive_Functions_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Arithmetic_Circuits","45925555_Arithmetic_circuits_The_chasm_at_depth_four_gets_wider","3635348_Lower_Bounds_on_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Derivatives"]}
