{"id":"307936557_Building_Systems_of_Assessment_for_Deeper_Learning","abstract":"Teachers' capacity to teach for deeper learning is strengthened through the process of planning for curriculum and assessments, scoring student work, and reflecting collectively on how to improve instruction. A system of assessments is necessary to capture the wide range of skills that students must master to be successful in postsecondary school and beyond. As they seek to develop new systems of assessment, states should, among other things: define college and career readiness; and evaluate the gap between the system as it now exists and the desired system. One of the key characteristics of a system of assessments is a continuum of options and methods for determining what students know and can do. Additionally, a carefully designed system of assessments should take into account the varied needs of all the constituents who use assessment data including students, parents, teachers, and others.","authors":["David T.
