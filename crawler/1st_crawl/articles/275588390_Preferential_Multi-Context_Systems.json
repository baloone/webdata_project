{"id":"275588390_Preferential_Multi-Context_Systems","abstract":"Multi-context systems (MCS) presented by Brewka and Eiter can be considered\nas a promising way to interlink decentralized and heterogeneous knowledge\ncontexts. In this paper, we propose preferential multi-context systems (PMCS),\nwhich provide a framework for incorporating a total preorder relation over\ncontexts in a multi-context system. In a given PMCS, its contexts are divided\ninto several parts according to the total preorder relation over them,\nmoreover, only information flows from a context to ones of the same part or\nless preferred parts are allowed to occur. As such, the first $l$ preferred\nparts of an PMCS always fully capture the information exchange between contexts\nof these parts, and then compose another meaningful PMCS, termed the\n$l$-section of that PMCS. We generalize the equilibrium semantics for an MCS to\nthe (maximal) $l_{\\leq}$-equilibrium which represents belief states at least\nacceptable for the $l$-section of an PMCS. We also investigate inconsistency\nanalysis in PMCS and related computational complexity issues.","authors":["Kedian Mu","Kewen Wang","Lian Wen"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 75","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2016.04.006","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270753086_Finding_Explanations_of_Inconsistency_in_Multi-Context_Systems","263792268_VIEWPOINTS_A_FRAMEWORK_FOR_INTEGRATING_MULTIPLE_PERSPECTIVES_IN_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT","227040726_Strategies_for_contextual_reasoning_with_conflicts_in_ambient_intelligence","221606369_Equilibria_in_Heterogeneous_Nonmonotonic_Multi-Context_Systems","221176825_Preference-Based_Inconsistency_Assessment_in_Multi-Context_Systems","220986369_Preferences_Contexts_and_Answer_Sets","220814830_Contextual_Default_Reasoning","220814330_Managed_Multi-Context_Systems","220605234_Preferences_and_Nonmonotonic_Reasoning","220547155_Weakening_conflicting_information_for_iterated_revision_and_knowledge_integration","220444776_Handling_Inconsistency_In_Distributed_Software_Requirements_Specifications_Based_On_Prioritized_Merging","220072522_Defeasible_Contextual_Reasoning_with_Arguments_in_Ambient_Intelligence","4016778_ViewPoints_Meaningful_relationships_are_difficult","2301411_Multilanguage_Hierarchical_Logics_or_How_We_Can_Do_Without_Modal_Logics","282318011_Distributed_Evaluation_of_Nonmonotonic_Multi-context_Systems","277290535_Viewpoints_A_Framework_for_Integrating_Multiple_Perspectives_in_System_Development","271617693_Measuring_the_significance_of_inconsistency_in_the_Viewpoints_framework","262152872_Possibilistic_Reasoning_in_Multi-Context_Systems_Preliminary_Report","249627210_2nd_international_workshop_on_living_with_inconsistency_IWLWI01","244446839_Viewpoints_A_Framework_for_Integrating_Multiple_Perspectives_in_System_Development_Int_Journal_of_Software_Engineering_and_Knowledge_Engineering","236628854_Computational_Complexity","228057894_Computational_Complexity","222826318_On_the_measure_of_conflicts_Shapley_Inconsistency_Values","222555555_Making_Inconsistency_Respectable_in_Software_Development","221393576_Finding_Explanations_of_Inconsistency_in_Multi-Context_Systems","221187696_Distributed_Defeasible_Contextual_Reasoning_in_Ambient_Computing","220813270_Weakening_Conflicting_Information_for_Iterated_Revision_and_Knowledge_Integration","220762633_Multilanguage_hierarchical_logics_or_How_we_can_do_without_modal_logics"]}
