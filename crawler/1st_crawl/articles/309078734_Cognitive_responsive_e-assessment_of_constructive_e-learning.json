{"id":"309078734_Cognitive_responsive_e-assessment_of_constructive_e-learning","abstract":"Semantic networks from 900 higher education students from different knowledge domains were obtained by using a computer system. Using computer simulated schemata behavior and/or analysis of semantic networks, relevant course schemata-related words were selected to implement semantic priming studies. The aim was testing for students´ word recognition latencies of schemata word pairs before and after course attendance. A trained neural net successfully differentiated students who integrated course schemata-related concepts in their lexicon from those who did not by analyzing recognition times after a course. Thus, an innovative e-assessment was implemented by developing a software system that integrates cognitive reports of mental representation due to learning (constructive assessment) with cognitive reports of automatic recognition processing of course content (reactive assessment). It is argued that this combined cognitive assessment leads to innovative advanced forms of e-learning evaluation.","authors":["Guadalupe Elizabeth Morales-Martinez","Ernesto Octavio López Ramírez"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.20368/1971-8829/1187"],"references":[]}
