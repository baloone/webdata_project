{"id":"223565688_Computer_based_testing_using_digital_ink_Participatory_design_of_a_Tablet_PC_based_assessment_application_for_secondary_education","abstract":"In this paper, we identify key challenges faced by computer-based assessment (CBA) in secondary education and we put forward a framework of design considerations: design with the students and teachers, select the most appropriate media platform and plan an evolution rather than a revolution of prior practices. We present the CBA application ‘MyTest’ which was developed using the participatory methodology We!Design, with the collaboration of 31 students and teachers. The application is targeted for the Tablet PC platform, provides “digital ink” capabilities and supports both closed-type and open questions, facilitating the transfer of traditional assessment practices to CBA. Both students and teachers were excited about the design sessions, and they asserted that they would rely more on educational software designed using this approach. The comparison of the ‘MyTest’ application with an assessment application developed with the same participatory methodology and the involvement of 40 undergraduate students revealed dissimilar expectations and needs of high school and undergraduate students that are often disguised or misinterpreted. A pilot evaluation of the application in real learning conditions was conducted with 31 students using Tablet PCs and with 37 students using traditional PCs. Interestingly, the Tablet PC platform rendered the ‘MyTest’ application more useful and usable to the students, validating our claims.","authors":["Panagiotis Siozos","George Palaigeorgiou","George Triantafyllakos","Theofanis Despotakis"],"meta":["May 2009Computers & Education 52(4):811-819","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["318133937_Alternatives_in_Assessment_of_Achievements_Learning_Processes_and_Prior_Knowledge","250927883_Participatory_design_in_secondary_education_Is_it_a_good_idea_Students'_and_teachers'_opinions_about_its_desirability_and_feasibility","314722340_The_evaluation_of_electronic_marking_of_examinations","292022280_Effective_change_management_in_higher_education","291800083_Student_perceptions_of_the_learning_benefits_of_computer-assisted_assessment_A_case_study_in_electronic_engineering","272914601_COMPARABILITY_OF_TESTING_USING_LAPTOP_AND_DESKTOP_COMPUTERS","257925911_Feedback_and_self-regulated_learning_A_therethical_synthesis","255172894_Assessment_2000_Towards_a_Pluralistic_Approach_to_Assessment","249025798_Giving_and_getting_feedback_on_composition_A_comparison_of_teacher_and_student_verbal_report","248498288_Secondary_school_students'_conceptions_of_assessment_and_feedback"]}
