{"id":"265051052_Motivation_and_cognitive_load_in_the_flipped_classroom_definition_rationale_and_a_call_for_research","abstract":"Flipped classroom approaches remove the traditional transmissive lecture and replace it with active in-class tasks and pre-/post-class work. Despite the popularity of these approaches in the media, Google search, and casual hallway chats, there is very little evidence of effectiveness or consistency in understanding what a flipped classroom actually is. Although the flipped terminology is new, some of the approaches being labelled ‘flipped’ are actually much older. In this paper, we provide a catch-all definition for the flipped classroom, and attempt to retrofit it with a pedagogical rationale, which we articulate through six testable propositions. These propositions provide a potential agenda for research about flipped approaches and form the structure of our investigation. We construct a theoretical argument that flipped approaches might improve student motivation and help manage cognitive load. We conclude with a call for more specific types of research into the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach.","authors":["Lakmal Abeysekera","Phillip Dawson"],"meta":["November 2014Higher Education Research and Development 34(1):1-14","DOI:10.1080/07294360.2014.934336"],"references":["316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","315482417_Team-based_Learning_in_the_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_Group_Work_to_Generate_Critical_Thinking_and_Engagement","311396228_The_flipped_classroom_strategy_What_is_it_and_how_can_it_best_be_used","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","303170761_The_classroom_flip_Using_Web_course_management_tools_to_become_the_guide_on_the_side","298104704_How_flipping_the_classroom_can_improve_the_traditional_lecture_The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education","297256376_Internalization_of_biopsychosocial_values_by_medical_students_A_test_of_self-determination_theory","289963904_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivations_Classic_definitions_and_new_directions","289963001_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivations_Classic_Definition_and_New_Directions","284498106_Process-oriented_guided_inquiry_learning_POGIL_and_the_POGIL_project","258182794_What_Forty_Years_of_Research_Says_About_the_Impact_of_Technology_on_Learning_A_Second-Order_Meta-Analysis_and_Validation_Study","257823637_The_Effect_of_Different_Active_Learning_Environments_on_Student_Outcomes_Related_to_Lifelong_Learning","257488394_Testing_the_hierarchical_SDT_model_the_case_of_performance-oriented_classrooms","279161560_Promoting_active_learning_in_respiratory_physiology_-_Positive_student_perception_and_improved_outcomes","264477334_Efficiency_in_Learning_Evidence-Based_Guidelines_to_Manage_Cognitive_Load"]}
