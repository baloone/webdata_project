{"id":"292550167_Using_Randomization_to_Attack_Similarity_Digests","abstract":"There has been considerable research and use of similarity digests and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) schemes - those hashing schemes where small changes in a file result in small changes in the digest. These schemes are useful in security and forensic applications. We examine how well three similarity digest schemes (Ssdeep, Sdhash and TLSH) work when exposed to random change. Various file types are tested by randomly manipulating source code, Html, text and executable files. In addition, we test for similarities in modified image files that were generated by cybercriminals to defeat fuzzy hashing schemes (spam images). The experiments expose shortcomings in the Sdhash and Ssdeep schemes that can be exploited in straight forward ways. The results suggest that the TLSH scheme is more robust to the attacks and random changes considered.","authors":["Jonathan Oliver","Scott Forman","Chun Cheng"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-45670-5_19","Conference: International Conference on Applications and Techniques in Information Security"],"references":["251702903_An_evaluation_of_forensic_similarity_hashes","222430237_Kornblum_J_Identifying_Almost_Identical_Files_using_Context_Triggered_Piecewise_Hashing_Digital_Investigation_3suppl_91-97","221352788_Data_Fingerprinting_with_Similarity_Digests","299411899_Security_and_implementation_analysis_of_the_similarity_digest_sdhash","271550689_TLSH_--_A_Locality_Sensitive_Hash"]}
