{"id":"329107874_Increasing_Passersby_Engagement_with_Public_Large_Interactive_Displays_A_Study_of_Proxemics_and_Conation","abstract":"Prior research has shown that large interactive displays deployed in public spaces are often underutilized, or even un- noticed, phenomena connected to 'interaction' and 'display blindness', respectively. To better understand how designers can mitigate these issues, we conducted a field experiment that compared how different visual cues impacted engagement with a public display. The deployed interfaces were designed to progressively reveal more information about the display and entice interaction through the use of visual content designed to evoke direct or indirect conation (the mental faculty related to purpose or will to perform an action), and different animation triggers (random or proxemic). Our results show that random triggers were more effective than proxemic triggers at overcoming display and interaction blindness. Our study of conation - the first we are aware of - found that \"conceptual\" visuals designed to evoke indirect conation were also useful in attracting people's attention.","authors":["Mojgan Ghare","Marvin Pafla","Caroline Wong","James Richard Wallace"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1145/3279778.3279789","Conference: the 2018 ACM International Conference"],"references":["325331496_Public_HMDs_Modeling_and_Understanding_User_Behavior_around_Public_Head-Mounted_Displays","320313602_Mirror_Mirror_on_the_Wall_Attracting_Passers-by_to_Public_Touch_Displays_With_User_Representations","319279878_Semi-Automated_Large-Scale_Evaluation_of_Public_Displays","316650760_Designing_Interactive_Advertisements_for_Public_Displays","316170502_They_are_looking_at_me_Understanding_how_Audience_Presence_Impacts_on_Public_Display_Users","300725614_Embarrassing_Interactions","298397007_Uncovering_the_Honeypot_Effect_How_Audiences_Engage_with_Public_Interactive_Systems","269062769_What_makes_you_click","266659193_Who_cares_about_the_Content_An_Analysis_of_Playful_Behaviour_at_a_Public_Display","262676495_Investigating_attraction_and_engagement_of_animation_on_large_interactive_walls_in_public_settings","262284291_Using_public_displays_to_stimulate_passive_engagement_active_engagement_and_discovery_in_Public_spaces","261662288_Indirect_persuasion_in_advertising_How_consumers_process_metaphors_presented_in_pictures_and_words","254462025_Territoriality_and_behaviour_on_and_around_large_vertical_publicly-shared_displays","254059154_Multipurpose_Interactive_Public_Displays_in_the_Wild_Three_Years_Later","236987434_Chained_displays_Configurations_of_public_displays_can_be_used_to_influence_actor-_audience-_and_passer-by_behavior","236987433_Looking_glass_A_field_study_on_noticing_interactivity_of_a_shop_window","224343325_EMDialog_Bringing_Information_Visualization_into_the_Museum","221572607_Requirements_and_design_space_for_interactive_public_displays","221568778_Social_Aspects_of_Using_Large_Public_Interactive_Displays_for_Collaboration","221540146_Proxemic_Interaction_Designing_for_a_Proximity_and_Orientation-Aware_Environment","221517345_Liveboard_A_Large_Interactive_Display_Supporting_Group_Meetings_Presentations_and_Remote_Collaboration","221515843_It's_Mine_Don't_Touch_interactions_at_a_large_multi-touch_display_in_a_city_centre","221342455_Real_World_Responses_to_Interactive_Gesture_Based_Public_Displays","317354349_The_concurrent_use_of_touch_and_mid-air_gestures_or_floor_mat_interaction_on_a_public_display","311169410_Proxemics-Based_Visual_Concepts_to_Attract_and_Engage_Public_Display_Users_Adaptive_Content_Motion_and_Adaptive_User_Shadow","301931786_Skeletons_and_Silhouettes_Comparing_User_Representations_at_a_Gesture-based_Large_Display","300725464_Somebody_Is_Peeking","289528382_Studying_Attraction_Power_in_Proxemics-Based_Visual_Concepts_for_Large_Public_Interactive_Displays","282236560_Dark_Patterns_in_Proxemic_Interactions_A_Critical_Perspective","276951804_Display_Blindness_Looking_Again_at_the_Visibility_of_Situated_Displays_using_Eye_Tracking","275315981_The_Hidden_Dimension","269227315_I_Love_My_Display","269227240_Understanding_Engagement_with_Interactive_Public_Displays","269191713_Dark_patterns_in_proxemic_interactions_A_critical_perspective","266659195_Is_Anyone_Looking_Mitigating_Shoulder_Surfing_on_Public_Displays_through_Awareness_and_Protection","266655405_Communiplay_A_field_study_of_a_public_display_media_space","266653157_Investigating_menu_discoverability_on_a_digital_tabletop_in_a_public_setting","262202053_Screenfinity_Extending_the_perception_area_of_content_on_very_large_public_displays","262166268_Overcoming_interaction_blindness_through_curiosity_objects","241278355_Discovering_Statistics_Using_SAS","235930814_The_Coding_Manual_for_Qualitative_Research","235361607_The_Hidden_Dimension","232951163_The_Role_of_Conation_Striving_in_the_Distance_Education_Enterprise","229738414_The_relationship_between_exhibit_characteristics_and_learning-associated_behaviors_in_a_science_museum_discovery_space","229711039_A_Symbolic_Interactionist_Analysis_of_Politics","224344488_I_don't_understand_it_either_but_it_is_cool_-_visitor_interactions_with_a_multi-touch_table_in_a_museum","224101940_Origins_of_ubiquitous_computing_research_at_PARC_in_the_late_1980s","221588319_MIKI_A_speech_enabled_Intelligent_Kiosk","221514169_Speak_out_and_annoy_someone_experience_with_intelligent_kiosks","221054596_Enticing_People_to_Interact_with_Large_Public_Displays_in_Public_Spaces","221015885_Display_Blindness_The_Effect_of_Expectations_on_Attention_towards_Digital_Signage","220962672_Animate_Objects_How_Physical_Motion_Encourages_Public_Interaction","220877440_HoloWall_Designing_a_Finger_Hand_Body_and_Object_Sensitive_Wall","221015986_Overcoming_Assumptions_and_Uncovering_Practices_When_Does_the_Public_Really_Look_at_Public_Displays","220962735_A_persuasive_interactive_mannequin_for_shop_windows"]}
