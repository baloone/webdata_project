{"id":"342608129_Unsupervised_Quantum_Gate_Control_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","abstract":"In near-term quantum computers, the operations are realized by unitary quantum gates. The precise and stable working mechanism of quantum gates is essential for the implementation of any complex quantum computations. Here, we define a method for the unsupervised control of quantum gates in near-term quantum computers. We model a scenario in which a tensor product structure of non-stable quantum gates is not controllable in terms of control theory. We prove that the non-stable quantum gate becomes controllable via a machine learning method if the quantum gates formulate an entangled gate structure.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1):10701","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-67018-1"],"references":["347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","341366393_Towards_storage_rings_as_quantum_computers","341349587_Towards_a_Distributed_Quantum_Computing_Ecosystem","341091863_Modeling_of_measurement-based_quantum_network_coding_on_a_superconducting_quantum_processor","339917893_Performance_Analysis_of_Quantum_Channels","339857182_Quantum_State_Optimization_and_Computational_Pathway_Evaluation_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","339309988_Theory_of_Noise-Scaled_Stability_Bounds_and_Entanglement_Rate_Maximization_in_the_Quantum_Internet","341635351_Approximate_approximation_on_a_quantum_annealer","340922426_Blind_channel_estimation_for_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution"]}
