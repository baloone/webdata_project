Several movements have emerged that aim to encourage the presence of women in these fields. This article presents the Digital Girls Program (Programa Meninas Digitals) developed by the Brazilian Computer Society, which aims to disseminate the many facets of computer science for high school and elementary school students in Brazil. The article presents the strategies adopted for implementing the program in the country and the actions of the program's sister projects.
