{"id":"326015130_Impact_of_Resource_Blocks_Allocation_Strategies_on_Downlink_Interference_and_SIR_Distributions_in_LTE_Networks_A_Stochastic_Geometry_Approach","abstract":"We propose a model based on stochastic geometry to assess downlink interference and signal over interference ratio (SIR) in LTE networks. The originality of this work lies in the proposition and combination of resource blocks assignment strategies, transmission power control, and realistic traffic patterns into a stochastic geometry model. For this model, we compute the first two moments of interference. They are used to parameterize its distribution from which we deduce the SIR distribution. Outage and transmission rates (modulation and coding rate) are then derived to evaluate the system performance. Simulations that cover a large set of scenarios show the accuracy of our proposal and allow us to compare these strategies with more complex ones that aim to minimize global interference. Numerical evaluations highlight the behavior of the LTE network for different traffic patterns/load, eNodeB density, and amount of resource blocks and offer insights about possible parameterization of LTE networks.","authors":["Anthony Busson","Iyad Lahsen-Cherif"],"meta":["June 2018Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 2018(99):1-15","DOI:10.1155/2018/9163783"],"references":["322674661_SIR_Coverage_Analysis_in_Cellular_Networks_with_Temporal_Traffic_A_Stochastic_Geometry_Approach","321964852_Multi-Objective_Optimization_in_5G_Hybrid_Networks","313447633_The_Meta_Distribution_of_the_SIR_for_Cellular_Networks_With_Power_Control","301876927_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Cellular_Networks_Using_Stochastic_Geometry_A_Tutorial","284076449_Ant_colony_learning_method_for_joint_MCS_and_resource_block_allocation_in_LTE_Femtocell_downlink_for_multimedia_applications_with_QoS_guarantees","320297016_Downlink_Energy_Efficiency_of_Power_Allocation_and_Wireless_Backhaul_Bandwidth_Allocation_in_Heterogeneous_Small_Cell_Networks","305675330_Dynamic_strict_fractional_frequency_reuse_for_software-defined_5G_networks","302630946_Call_Detail_Records_to_Characterize_Usages_and_Mobility_Events_of_Phone_Users","289772133_Analytical_modeling_of_heterogeneous_cellular_networks_Geometry_coverage_and_capacity","273395469_Recent_Advances_in_Radio_Resource_Management_for_Heterogeneous_LTELTE-A_Networks"]}
