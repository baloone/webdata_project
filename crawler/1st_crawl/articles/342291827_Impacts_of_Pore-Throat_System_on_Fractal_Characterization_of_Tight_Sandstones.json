{"id":"342291827_Impacts_of_Pore-Throat_System_on_Fractal_Characterization_of_Tight_Sandstones","abstract":"The pore-throat structures play a dominant role in the evaluation of properties of tight sandstone, but it remains difficult to determine the related parameters and understand their impact on reservoir quality. Hence, toward this end, we analyze the experimental data that are indicative of the pore-throat system, then we investigate the effect of fractal dimensions of pore-throat structures on petrologic and physical properties, and finally, the optical observations, fractal theory, and prediction model were integrated to explore the qualities of various reservoir types in tight sandstones. The results show that the fractal dimensions of the mercury intrusion curve correspond to three pore-throat types and those of the mercury extrusion curve could correspond to two pore-throat types. Five types of reservoirs were identified, the best reservoir type has a high percentage of interparticle and dissolution pores but a low proportion of clay-related pores, and the differences in pore-throat connectivity of various types affect storage capacity significantly. The storage ability prediction models of various reservoir types are raised by integrated experimental data. This work employed a comprehensive fractal theory based on capillary pressure curves and helps to explore how pore-throat systems influence reservoir quality in tight sandstones.","authors":["Dengke Liu","Zhaolin Gu","Ruixiang Liang","Junwei su"],"meta":["June 2020Geofluids 2020(9):1-17","DOI:10.1155/2020/4941501"],"references":["341082553_An_analytical_model_to_couple_gas_storage_and_transport_capacity_in_organic_matter_with_noncircular_pores","338521437_Numerical_study_on_flow_field_and_pollutant_dispersion_in_an_ideal_street_canyon_within_a_real_tree_model_at_different_wind_velocities","332772174_A_new_fractal_approach_for_describing_induced-fracture_porositypermeability_compressibility_in_stimulated_unconventional_reservoirs","332682015_Direct_numerical_simulation_of_pore_scale_particle-water-oil_transport_in_porous_media","332405515_Analysis_of_pore_size_distribution_and_fractal_dimension_in_tight_sandstone_with_mercury_intrusion_porosimetry","330813827_Pore-scale_direct_numerical_simulation_of_particle_transport_in_porous_media","326792824_Organic_matter_mineral_composition_pore_size_and_gas_sorption_capacity_of_lacustrine_mudstones_Implications_for_the_shale_oil_and_gas_exploration_in_the_Dongying_depression_eastern_China","323359947_PORE-THROAT_STRUCTURE_AND_FRACTAL_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_SHIHEZI_FORMATION_TIGHT_GAS_SANDSTONE_IN_THE_ORDOS_BASIN_CHINA","322173784_Impacts_of_clay_on_pore_structure_storage_and_percolation_of_tight_sandstones_from_the_Songliao_Basin_China_Implications_for_genetic_classification_of_tight_sandstone_reservoirs","318913826_Occurrence_and_origin_of_pore-lining_chlorite_and_its_effectiveness_on_preserving_porosity_in_sandstone_of_the_middle_Yanchang_Formation_in_the_southwest_Ordos_Basin"]}
