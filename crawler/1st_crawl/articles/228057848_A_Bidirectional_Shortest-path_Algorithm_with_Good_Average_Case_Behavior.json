{"id":"228057848_A_Bidirectional_Shortest-path_Algorithm_with_Good_Average_Case_Behavior","abstract":"The two-terminal shortest-path problem asks for the shortest directed path from a specified nodes to a specified noded in a complete directed graphG onn nodes, where each edge has a nonnegative length. We show that if the length of each edge is chosen independently from the\nexponential distribution, and adjacency lists at each node are sorted by length, then a priority-queue implementation of Dijkstra's\nunidirectional search algorithm has the expected running time Θ(n logn). We present a bidirectional search algorithm that has expected running time Θ(√n logn). These results are generalized to apply to a wide class of edge-length distributions, and to sparse graphs. If adjacency\nlists are not sorted, bidirectional search has the expected running time Θ(a√n) on graphs of average degreea, as compared with Θ(an) for unidirectional search.","authors":["Michael Luby","Prabakar Ragde"],"meta":["June 1989Algorithmica 4:551-567","DOI:10.1007/BF01553908","SourceDBLP","Project: Approximation algorithms"],"references":["284529447_Analytic_Inequalities","265435634_Analytic_inequalities_In_cooperation_with_PM_Vasic","228057870_A_New_Algorithm_for_Finding_All_Shortest_Paths_in_a_Graph_of_Positive_Arcs_in_Average_Time_On2_log2_n","225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","221369165_Theoretical_Improvements_in_Algorithmic_Efficiency_for_Network_Flow_Problems","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220616515_A_New_Algorithm_for_Finding_all_Shortest_Paths_in_a_Graph_of_Positive_Arcs_in_Average_Time_0n","220430452_Theoretical_Improvements_in_Algorithmic_Efficiency_for_Network_Flow_Problems","30867663_Branch_and_Bound_Methods_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","30867274_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms"]}
