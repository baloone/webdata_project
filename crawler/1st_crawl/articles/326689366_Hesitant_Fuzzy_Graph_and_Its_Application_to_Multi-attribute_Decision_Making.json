{"id":"326689366_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Graph_and_Its_Application_to_Multi-attribute_Decision_Making","abstract":"As an effective tool for describing indecisiveness quantitatively, hesitant fuzzy sets deal with the hesitation and the fuzziness in uncertain information simultaneously to solve multi-attribute decision making problems under the background of indecisiveness. Aiming at multi-attribute decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy attribute values, the related model and the multi-attribute decision making approach based on the fuzzy graph theory are studied. Firstly, the concept of hesitant fuzzy graph and some common operational laws are presented. Then, a general hesitant fuzzy graph-based multi-attribute decision making method is established. Finally, an illustrative example and the comparative analysis are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.","authors":["C. Zhang","D.
