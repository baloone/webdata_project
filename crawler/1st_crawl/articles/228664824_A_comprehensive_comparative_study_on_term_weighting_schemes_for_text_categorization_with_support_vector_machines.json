In this paper, we conducted comprehensive experiments to compare various term weight-ing schemes with SVM on two widely-used benchmark data sets. We also presented a new term weighting scheme tf.rf to improve the term's discriminating power. The controlled experimental results showed that this newly proposed tf.rf scheme is significantly better than other widely-used term weighting schemes. Compared with schemes related with tf factor alone, the idf factor does not improve or even decrease the term's discriminating power for text categorization.","authors":["Man Lan","Chew Lim Tan","Sam-Yuan Sung"],"meta":[],"references":["221613897_Inductive_Learning_Algorithms_and_Representations_for_Text_Categorization","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","228907460_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_How_to_Represent_Texts_in_Input_Space","223117716_Buckley_C_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval_Information_Processing_Management_245_513-523","220228998_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","13540799_Approximate_Statistical_Tests_for_Comparing_Supervised_Classification_Learning_Algorithms","2379283_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features"]}
