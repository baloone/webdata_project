{"id":"264993463_The_k-Separator_Problem","abstract":"Given a vertex-weighted undirected graph G = (V,E,w) and a positive integer k, we consider the k-separator problem: it consists in finding a minimum-weight subset of vertices whose removal leads to a graph where the size of each connected component is less than or equal to k. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for some graph classes: for cycles and trees by a dynamic programming approach and by using a peculiar graph transformation coupled with recent results from the literature for m\nK\n2-free, (G\n1, G\n2, G\n3, P\n6)-free, interval-filament, asteroidal triple-free, weakly chordal, interval and circular-arc graphs. Approximation algorithms are also presented.","authors":["Walid Ben-Ameur","Sidi Mohamed Mohamed Ahmed","Jos√© Neto"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38768-5_31","Conference: International Computing and Combinatorics Conference"],"references":["265069503_Lex-BFS_a_Partition_Reening_Technique_Application_to_Transitive_Orientation_Interval_Graph_Recognition_and_Consecutive_1's_Testing","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","200031635_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","2566523_Decomposing_Matrices_into_Blocks","2455275_Cut_Problems_And_Their_Application_To_Divide-And-Conquer","304374716_On_the_Complexity_of_Dissociation_Set_Problems_in_Graphs","280765566_Lex-BFS_and_partition_refinement_with_applications_to_transitive_orientation_interval_graph_recognition_and_consecutive_ones_testing","239665855_Combinatorial_Optimization_Theory_and_Algorithms","230725836_On_the_Complexity_of_Dissociation_Set_Problems_in_Graphs","227866596_On_graphs_with_polynomially_solvable_maximum-weight_clique_problem","226454065_The_primal-dual_method_for_approximation_algorithms","222946211_Weakly_triangulated_graphs","222829615_Lex-BFS_and_partition_refinement","222634563_Some_results_on_graphs_without_long_induced_paths","222510935_Algorithms_for_weakly_triangulated_graphs","222183106_Algorithme_de_recherche_d'un_stable_de_cardinalite_maximum_dans_un_graphe_sans_etoile","220780409_A_polynomial_algorithm_to_find_an_independent_set_of_maximum_weight_in_a_fork-free_graph","220618257_Node-Deletion_Problems_on_Bipartite_Graphs","220589950_Independent_packings_in_structured_graphs","220589356_The_vertex_separator_problem_A_polyhedral_investigation","220533291_Independent_Sets_in_Asteroidal_Triple-Free_Graphs","220113239_Maximum_weight_independent_sets_and_cliques_in_intersection_graphs_of_filaments","220074814_On_maximal_independent_sets_of_vertices_in_claw-free_graphs","4791334_Disconnecting_graphs_by_removing_vertices_A_polyhedral_approach","2612193_k-Edge_Subgraph_Problems"]}
