{"id":"314153227_NP_Complete_Problems_Are_Not_Equivalent","abstract":"NP Complete (abbreviated as NPC) problems, standing at the crux of deciding whether P=NP, are one of hardest problems in computer science and other related areas. Through decades, NPC problems are treated as one class. Observing that NPC problems have different natures, it is unlikely that they will have the same complexity. Our intensive study shows that NPC problems are not all equivalent in computational complexity, and they can be further classified. We then show that the classification of NPC problems may depend on their reduction methods, exact algorithms, natures, and the boundary between P and NP. Finally we discuss about the NPC problems in real-life and shine some lights on find better solutions to NPC problems.","authors":["Wenhong Tian"],"meta":["February 2017","Project: National Science Foundation of China"],"references":["292393040_The_PNP_poll","268524981_Memcomputing_NP-complete_problems_in_polynomial_time_using_polynomial_resources_and_collective_states","228535845_Fast_algorithms_for_max_independent_set","227121797_General_k-opt_submoves_for_the_Lin-Kernighan_TSP_heuristic","317404417_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","283709288_Mathematician_claims_breakthrough_in_complexity_theory","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","222707899_A_deterministic_2-2k1n_algorithm_for_k-SAT_based_on_local_search","3694898_Exact_Coloring_Of_Real-life_Graphs_Is_Easy","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220618427_Finding_a_Maximum_Independent_Set","216877586_On_Cliques_in_Graphs","3635326_3-coloring_in_time_013446_A_no-MIS_algorithm"]}
