{"id":"230630750_Principles_Of_Optics","abstract":"Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the\ntwentieth century, and probably the most influential book in optics\npublished in the past forty years. This edition has been thoroughly\nrevised and updated, with new material covering the CAT scan,\ninterference with broad-band light and the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfeld\ndiffraction theory. This edition also details scattering from\ninhomogeneous media and presents an account of the principles of\ndiffraction tomography to which Emil Wolf has made a basic contribution.\nSeveral new appendices are also included. This new edition will be\ninvaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers\nworking in most areas of optics.","authors":["Max Born","Emil Wolf"],"meta":["January 1975The Mathematical Gazette 1(370)","DOI:10.2307/3612240","Edition: fifthPublisher: Pergamon Press"],"references":[]}
