{"id":"317124799_Hydroacylation_of_Activated_Ketones_Catalyzed_by_N-Heterocyclic_Carbenes","abstract":"Buy Article Permissions and Reprints\n\nSignificance\nHere the authors report a hydro­acylation of α-keto esters with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbenes. The authors have found that hydroacylation products are formed in aprotic solvents (such as dichloro­methane) whereas in protic solvents (such as methanol) the corresponding alcohols are produced. The triazolium salt 1 in combination with DBU was found to be an effective catalytic system for the reaction. By using 10-15 mol% of catalyst 1, good yields (72-83%) are obtained for a variety of α-keto esters.","authors":["A. Chan","K.
