{"id":"319770289_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection","abstract":"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classification tasks [14]. In this paper we go one step further and address the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks. We define a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution object detections at a lowcost by a fewnetwork applications. State-of-the-art performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC.","authors":["Christian Szegedy","Alexander Toshev","Dumitru Erhan"],"meta":["January 2013","Conference: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems"],"references":["240308781_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Scene_Labeling","230690781_Object-Class_Segmentation_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","221363369_Towards_Scalable_Representations_of_Object_Categories_Learning_a_Hierarchy_of_Parts","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","267709055_Deep_Neural_Networks_Segment_Neuronal_Membranes_in_Electron_Microscopy_Images","237417270_Discriminatively_Trained_Mixtures_of_Deformable_Part_Models","221497515_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","221364242_Latent_Hierarchical_Structural_Learning_for_Object_Detection"]}
