{"id":"318398771_Challenges_with_Assessing_the_Impact_of_NFS_Advances_on_the_Security_of_Pairing-Based_Cryptography","abstract":"In the past two years there have been several advances in Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in finite fields \\({\\mathbb F}_{p^n}\\) where p is prime and \\(n > 1\\) is a small integer. This article presents a concise overview of these algorithms and discusses some of the challenges with assessing their impact on keylengths for pairing-based cryptosystems.","authors":["Alfred Menezes","Palash Sarkar","Shashank Singh"],"meta":["December 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-61273-7_5","Conference: International Conference on Cryptology in Malaysia"],"references":["260870163_Implementing_Pairings_at_the_192-Bit_Security_Level","255673189_Discrete_Logarithms_in_GFP_Using_the_Number_Field_Sieve","225158770_The_number_field_sieve","221425359_Constructing_Brezing-Weng_Pairing-Friendly_Elliptic_Curves_Using_Elements_in_the_Cyclotomic_Field","221355610_The_Number_Field_Sieve_in_the_Medium_Prime_Case","221274540_Pairing-Friendly_Elliptic_Curves_of_Prime_Order","46101317_Constructive_And_Destructive_Facets_Of_Weil_Descent_On_Elliptic_Curves","2894224_Constructing_Elliptic_Curves_with_Prescribed_Embedding_Degrees","332421970_A_unified_polynomial_selection_method_for_the_tower_number_field_sieve_algorithm","314376254_Computing_Individual_Discrete_Logarithms_Faster_in_mathrmGFpn_with_the_NFS-DL_Algorithm","314071458_Extended_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve_with_Application_to_Finite_Fields_of_Arbitrary_Composite_Extension_Degree","312823567_The_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_with_Conjugation_and_Generalized_Joux-Lercier_Methods","309778247_A_General_Polynomial_Selection_Method_and_New_Asymptotic_Complexities_for_the_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve_Algorithm","305472588_Extended_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve_A_New_Complexity_for_the_Medium_Prime_Case","304611453_Candidate_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation_and_Functional_Encryption_for_All_Circuits","304554882_Type_2_Structure-Preserving_Signature_Schemes_Revisited","301670589_New_Complexity_Trade-Offs_for_the_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_Algorithm_in_Non-Prime_Fields","282679616_The_Special_Number_Field_Sieve_in_F_pn_Application_to_Pairing-Friendly_Constructions","281886478_Improving_NFS_for_the_Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_in_Non-prime_Finite_Fields","281390434_Recommendation_for_key_management_Part_1_General_revision_3","278619833_The_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve","268719984_Algorithmic_Cryptanalysis","268244055_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Index_Computation_mod_p","268022030_The_Special_Number_Field_Sieve_in_mathbbF_pn","266999067_The_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_for_Medium_and_High_Characteristic_Finite_Fields","265571201_Practical_Multilinear_Maps_over_the_Integers","261022132_Candidate_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation_and_Functional_Encryption_for_all_Circuits","242987595_Bounds_for_resultants_of_univariate_and_bivariate_polynomials","239524620_A_Heuristic_Quasi-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Logarithm_in_Finite_Fields_of_Small_Characteristic","228638072_The_brave_new_world_of_bodacious_assumptions_in_cryptography","228381085_On_the_discrete_logarithm_problem_in_elliptic_curves_II","225671744_Identity-Based_Encryption_from_the_Weil_Pairing","221609043_Group_signatures_with_verifier-local_revocation","221425397_Boneh-Boyen_Signatures_and_the_Strong_Diffie-Hellman_Problem","221347972_Security_Analysis_of_the_Strong_Diffie-Hellman_Problem","220577527_Using_number_fields_to_compute_logarithms_in_finite_fields","220576503_Improvements_to_the_general_number_field_sieve_for_discrete_logarithms_in_prime_fields_A_comparison_with_the_Gaussian_integer_method","220570445_On_cryptographic_protocols_employing_asymmetric_pairings_-_The_role_of_PS_revisited","220479115_Short_Signatures_Without_Random_Oracles_and_the_SDH_Assumption_in_Bilinear_Groups"]}
