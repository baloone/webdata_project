{"id":"319815053_Logics_with_Copy_and_Remove","abstract":"We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators copy and remove. The copy operator replicates a given model, and the remove operator removes paths in a given model. We show that the product update by an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy and remove operations. We also show that copy and remove operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed by action models. We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy and remove operations.","authors":["Carlos Areces","Hans van Ditmarsch","Raul Fervari","Fran√ßois Schwarzentruber"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44145-9_4","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation","Project: Relation-Changing Logics"],"references":["277141984_Relation-Changing_Modal_Logics","266733236_Swap_logic","260345515_Moving_Arrows_and_Four_Model_Checking_Results","258083714_On_the_Complexity_of_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","344486660_Modal_Logic","269353850_Public_announcements_public_assignments_and_the_complexity_of_their_logic","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","259417593_Arrow_update_logic","239665785_Cambridge_tracts_in_theoretical_computer_science","239407954_Tableau_Methods_for_Modal_and_Temporal_Logics"]}
