{"id":"306398143_Stack_and_Queue_Layouts_via_Layered_Separators","abstract":"It is known that every proper minor-closed class of graphs has bounded stack-number (a.k.a. book thickness and page number). While this includes notable graph families such as planar graphs and graphs of bounded genus, many other graph families are not closed under taking minors. For fixed $g$ and $k$, we show that every $n$-vertex graph that can be embedded on a surface of genus $g$ with at most $k$ crossings per edge has stack-number $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$; this includes $k$-planar graphs. The previously best known bound for the stack-number of these families was $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$, except in the case of $1$-planar graphs. Analogous results are proved for map graphs that can be embedded on a surface of fixed genus. None of these families is closed under taking minors. The main ingredient in the proof of these results is a construction proving that $n$-vertex graphs that admit constant layered separators have $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ stack-number.","authors":["Vida DujmoviÄ‡","Fabrizio Frati"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications 22(1)","DOI:10.7155/jgaa.00454"],"references":["300254406_1-Planar_Graphs_have_Constant_Book_Thickness","283118118_On_the_Book_Thickness_of_1-Planar_Graphs","273788578_The_Book_Thickness_of_1-Planar_Graphs_is_Constant","312996176_On_The_Queue_Number_Of_Planar_Graphs","278416789_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Independent_Sets_in_Map_Graphs","266000203_Graphs_with_E_Edges_Have_Pagenumber_OE","264947425_Genus_g_Graphs_Have_Pagenumber_Og","261054241_Layered_Separators_for_Queue_Layouts_3D_Graph_Drawing_and_Nonrepetitive_Coloring","249750533_New_bounds_on_the_edge_number_of_a_k-map_graph","239060956_Book_Embeddings_of_Graphs","239060954_Book_embeddings_of_graphs_and_minor-closed_classes","237077202_Layered_Separators_in_Minor-Closed_Families_with_Applications","235358443_Graph_Layouts_via_Layered_Separators","230596035_A_Separator_Theorem_for_Planar_Graphs","227282879_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Independent_Sets_in_Map_Graphs","224206226_On_the_Queue_Number_of_Planar_Graphs","221663389_Nonrepetitive_Colourings_of_Planar_Graphs_with_Olog_n_Colours","220898111_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_the_k_r-Center_in_Planar_Graphs_and_Map_Graphs","220573932_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_in_Four_Pages","220432383_Map_graphs","51951258_Bidimensionality_and_Geometric_Graphs","30508390_Graphs_Drawn_With_Few_Crossings_Per_Edge","26645259_On_Linear_Layouts_of_Graphs","1957242_Layout_of_Graphs_with_Bounded_Tree-Width"]}
