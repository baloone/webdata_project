{"id":"262370367_The_Six_Facets_of_Serious_Game_Design_A_Methodology_Enhanced_by_Our_Design_Pattern_Library","abstract":"Serious games rely on two main types of competence and expertise: the game designer's and the teacher's. One of the main problems in creating a serious game that is both amusing and educational, and efficiently so, is building a cooperative environment allowing both types of experts to understand each other and communicate with a common language. The aim of this paper is to create such a language using Design Patterns based on our framework: the Six Facets of Serious Game Design. If many design patterns already exist for the game design aspects, they are in short supply on the pedagogical side.","authors":["Bertrand Marne","John Wisdom","Benjamin Huynh-Kim-Bang","Jean-marc Labat"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33263-0_17","Conference: Proceedings of the 7th European conference on Technology Enhanced Learning"],"references":["271202681_Conceptual_and_Technical_Frameworks_for_Serious_Games","271202629_Articuler_motivation_et_apprentissage_grace_aux_facettes_du_jeu_serieux","262174857_A_Design_Pattern_Library_for_Mutual_Understanding_and_Cooperation_in_Serious_Game_Design","254798732_Design_Patterns_for_Learning_Games","318494438_Flow_the_psychology_of_optimal_experience","313362969_A_conceptual_framework_for_serious_games","281050326_Tools_and_Methods_for_Efficiently_Designing_Serious_Games","270120441_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience","261303484_The_Complete_guide_to_Simulations_and_Serious_Games_how_the_Most_Valuable_Content_Will_be_Created_in_the_Age_Beyond_Gutenberg_to_Google","259532895_The_Art_of_Game_Design_A_book_of_lenses"]}
