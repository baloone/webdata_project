{"id":"351288859_A_note_on_weighted_multi-glove_games","abstract":"In this note we consider the class of weighted multi-glove games. We will show that these games are totally balanced and we will characterize the weighted multi-glove games that are supermodular and pmas-admissible. Moreover, we will provide an explicit expression for the Shapley value of the supermodular and a large part of the pmas-admissible weighted multi-glove games.","authors":["Stefano Moretti","Henk Norde"],"meta":["November 2021Social Choice and Welfare 57(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00355-021-01337-8"],"references":["225983316_On_the_core_of_linear_production_games","24065482_Type_monotonic_allocation_schemes_for_a_class_of_market_games","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","265353515_The_solutions_of_a_symmetric_market_game","249335443_Formation_of_cartels_in_glove_markets_and_the_modiclus","228108092_Solutions_to_general_non-zero-sum_games","226282465_Cores_of_convex_games","224818275_Stable_Allocations_of_Risk","222320685_Population_monotonic_allocation_schemes_for_cooperative_games_with_transferable_utility","24058799_The_core_and_the_bargaining_set_in_glove-market_games"]}
