{"id":"318134519_Predictive_Business_Process_Monitoring_with_LSTM_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Predictive business process monitoring methods exploit logs of completed cases of a process in order to make predictions about running cases thereof. Existing methods in this space are tailor-made for specific prediction tasks. Moreover, their relative accuracy is highly sensitive to the dataset at hand, thus requiring users to engage in trial-and-error and tuning when applying them in a specific setting. This paper investigates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as an approach to build consistently accurate models for a wide range of predictive process monitoring tasks. First, we show that LSTMs outperform existing techniques to predict the next event of a running case and its timestamp. Next, we show how to use models for predicting the next task in order to predict the full continuation of a running case. Finally, we apply the same approach to predict the remaining time, and show that this approach outperforms existing tailor-made methods.","authors":["Niek Tax","Ilya Verenich","Marcello La Rosa","Marlon Dumas"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_30","Conference: International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering"],"references":["303959955_Comprehensible_Predictive_Models_for_Business_Processes","301854552_Time_and_Activity_Sequence_Prediction_of_Business_Process_Instances","282633703_A_general_process_mining_framework_for_correlating_predicting_and_clustering_dynamic_behavior_based_on_event_logs","281446750_Complex_Symbolic_Sequence_Encodings_for_Predictive_Monitoring_of_Business_Processes","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","316743375_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Predicting_Process_Behaviour_at_Runtime","307955489_Distributed_representations_of_words_and_phrases_and_their_compositionality","303394550_Predictive_Business_Process_Monitoring_Framework_with_Hyperparameter_Optimization","300474911_Process_Mining_to_Forecast_the_Future_of_Running_Cases","290620661_Queue_Mining_-_Predicting_Delays_in_Service_Processes"]}
