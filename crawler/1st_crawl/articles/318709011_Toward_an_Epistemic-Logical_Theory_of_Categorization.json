{"id":"318709011_Toward_an_Epistemic-Logical_Theory_of_Categorization","abstract":"Categorization systems are widely studied in psychology, sociology, and organization theory as information-structuring devices which are critical to decision-making processes. In the present paper, we introduce a sound and complete epistemic logic of categories and agents' categorical perception. The Kripke-style semantics of this logic is given in terms of data structures based on two domains: one domain representing objects (e.g. market products) and one domain representing the features of the objects which are relevant to the agents' decision-making. We use this framework to discuss and propose logic-based formalizations of some core concepts from psychological, sociological, and organizational research in categorization theory.","authors":["Willem Conradie","Sabine Frittella","Alessandra Palmigiano","Michele Piazzai"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.251.12","Projects: The logics of categories, concepts, theories, and informational entropyunified correspondence"],"references":["309360141_The_producer-consumer_classification_gap_and_its_effects_on_music_festival_success","308320810_Multi-type_Sequent_Calculi","305908493_Categories_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Two_Sorts","281065871_Category_Spanning_Evaluation_and_Performance_Revised_Theory_and_Test_on_the_Corporate_Law_Market","276535174_Conceptual_Spaces_and_the_Consequences_of_Category_Spanning","274788799_Multi-type_Display_Calculus_for_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic","273089346_An_Ecology_of_Social_Categories","318237628_Constructive_Canonicity_for_Lattice-Based_Fixed_Point_Logics","318163587_Lattice_Logic_Properly_Displayed","300169419_Unified_Correspondence"]}
