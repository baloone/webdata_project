{"id":"320582717_Lower_Bounds_on_the_Number_of_Realizations_of_Rigid_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper we take advantage of a recently published algorithm for computing the number of realizations of minimally rigid graphs. Combining computational results with the theory of constructing new rigid graphs by gluing, we give a new lower bound on the maximal possible number of realizations for graphs with a given number of vertices. We extend these ideas to rigid frameworks in three dimensions and we derive similar lower bounds, by exploiting data from extensive Gr\\\"obner basis computations.","authors":["Georg Grasegger","Christoph Koutschan","Elias Tsigaridas"],"meta":["October 2017Experimental Mathematics 29(2)","DOI:10.1080/10586458.2018.1437851"],"references":["267664725_Distance_Geometry_Theory_Methods_and_Applications","318392715_Computing_the_number_of_realizations_of_a_Laman_graph","312550604_The_Number_of_Realizations_of_a_Laman_Graph","268948697_Die_graphische_Statik_der_starren_Korper","266538136_On_Spaces_of_Infinitesimal_Motions_and_Three_Dimensional_Henneberg_Extensions","260030948_On_the_Number_of_Realizations_of_Certain_Henneberg_Graphs_arising_in_Protein_Conformation","254887742_Mixed_Volume_and_Distance_Geometry_Techniques_for_Counting_Euclidean_Embeddings_of_Rigid_Graphs","230541262_Zur_Gliederungstheorie_raumlicher_Fachwerke","230364041_Uber_die_Gliederung_ebener_Fachwerke","228530770_A_Spatial_Nine-Bar_Linkage_Possible_Configurations_and_Conditions_for_Paradoxical_Mobility"]}
