{"id":"220427127_Jump_Searching_A_Fast_Sequential_Search_Technique","abstract":"When sequential file structures must be used and binary searching is not feasible, jump searching becomes an appealing alternative. This paper explores variants of the classic jump searching scheme where the optimum jump size is the square root of the number of records. Multiple level and variable size jump strategies are explored, appropriate applications are discussed and performance is evaluated.","authors":["Ben Shneiderman"],"meta":["October 1978Communications of the ACM 21(10):831-834","DOI:10.1145/359619.359623","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234789892_Search_within_a_Page","298035158_FORTRAN_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_THE_CODASYL_DATA_BASE_TASK_GROUP_REPORT","234794728_Binary_Search_Trees_and_File_Organization","224102621_Indexing_design_considerations","220618277_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Merging_Two_Disjoint_Linearly_Ordered_Sets","220426907_Analysis_of_Design_Alternatives_for_Virtual_Memory_Indexes","220280805_Polynomial_Search","220225583_Batched_Searching_of_Sequential_and_Tree_Structured_Files","220091241_A_model_for_optimizing_indexed_file_structures","220090946_A_nucleus_of_a_theorem-prover_described_in_Algol-68"]}
