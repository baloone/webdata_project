{"id":"313890950_Nonlinear_Robust_Output_Stabilization_for_Mechanical_Systems_Based_on_Luenberger-Like_ControllerObserver","abstract":"This paper addresses to demonstrate the Uniform-Ultimately Bounded Stability (UUB-Stability) of the PD+ compensator where the joint velocity is not available to be measured but rather it is estimated. The proposed stabilization control strategy is developed for a ”n” degree of freedom Robotic Manipulator process where the joint speed is not available to be measured, furthermore, the external disturbances and/or uncertain dynamics are considered in the system dynamics. To conclude the closed-loop robust stabilization, the proposed feedback strategy is based on nonlinear state estimation with a Luenberger-like observer and the classical PD+ used in robot manipulators.","authors":["P.
