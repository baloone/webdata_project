{"id":"308962767_Students'_acceptance_and_readiness_for_E-learning_in_Northeastern_Thailand","abstract":"The study explored student readiness for online learning in the Northeast of Thailand, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The survey also explored studentsâ€™ self-regulation, computing devices ownership, and level of familiarity with education-related technologies. The responses imply that students have a slightly positive perception toward e-learning. They use mobile technologies extensively, and have experience using social media; but are unfamiliar with other collaborative e-learning tools. A discussion includes recommendations for cultural context and the design of e-learning in Thailand.","authors":["Anchalee Ngampornchai","Jonathan Adams"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1186/s41239-016-0034-x"],"references":["265120593_Computer_Literacy_and_Competency_A_Survey_of_Indonesian_Teachers_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language","263544652_Assessing_User_Acceptance_toward_Blog_Technology_Using_the_UTAUT_Model","258652158_Computer_Literacy_and_E-learning_Attitudes_among_First_Year_Students_in_a_Ghanaian_Medical_School","258155881_Baccalaureate_nursing_students'_anxiety_related_computer_literacy_A_sample_from_Jordan","255567249_Understanding_the_Factors_Limiting_the_Acceptability_of_Online_Courses_and_Degrees","287651935_Development_of_an_instrument_to_measure_perceptions_of_adoption_of_an_information_technology_innovations","286314304_Assessing_e-learning_acceptance_by_university_students_in_Thailand","274799723_Diffusion_of_Innovations","270031464_E-learning_platforms_and_humanities_education_an_African_case_study","258182976_English_InThailand"]}
