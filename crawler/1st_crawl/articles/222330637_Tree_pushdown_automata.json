{"id":"222330637_Tree_pushdown_automata","abstract":"This paper presents a new type of automaton called a tree pushdown automaton (a bottom-up tree automaton augmented with internal memory in the form of a tree, similar to the way a stack is added to a finite state machine to produce a pushdown automaton) and shows that the class of languages recognized by such automata is identical to the class of context-free tree languages.","authors":["Karl Schimpf","Jean Gallier"],"meta":["February 1985Journal of Computer and System Sciences 30(1):25-40","DOI:10.1016/0022-0000(85)90002-9","SourceDBLP"],"references":["300927891_Some_open_questions_and_recent_results_on_tree_transducers_and_tree_languages","226063515_Pushdown_tree_automata","220544483_Mappings_and_Grammars_on_Trees","268699652_Syntactic_Methods_in_Pattern_Recognition","268501755_Program_schemes_recursion_schemes_and_formal_languages","244520490_Tree_automata_An_informal_survey","243506473_Processors_for_infinite_codes_of_the_shannon-fano_type","242530108_Context-Free_Grammars_and_Pushdown_Storage","242430394_The_theory_of_parsing_translation_and_compiling","242361757_Introduction_to_Formal_Language_Theory","242324887_Explicit_definitions_and_linguistic_dominoes","239586455_On_the_interpretation_of_recursive_polyadic_program_schemes","226689038_Generalized_finite_automata_theory_with_an_application_to_a_decision_problem_of_second-order_logic","223151844_Characterizing_derivation_trees_of_context-free_grammars_through_a_generalization_of_finite_automata_theory","222917542_Tree_acceptors_and_some_of_their_applications","222511947_On_Certain_Formal_Properties_of_Grammars","222443906_On_the_Translation_of_Languages_from_Left_to_Right","222188904_DPDA's_in_Atomic_Normal_Form'_and_Applications_to_Equivalence_Problems","221591499_Context-Free_Grammars_on_Trees","220574346_Completeness_Results_for_the_Equivalence_of_Recursive_Schemas","220432519_Nested_Stack_Automata","220248669_Parsing_Macro_Grammars_Top_Down","220151976_A_Representation_of_Trees_by_Languages_II","44493596_The_Theory_of_Parsing_Translation_and_Compiling_Vol_1_Parsing","44460491_Syntactic_methods_in_pattern_recognition_King_Sun_Fu","33788814_A_parsing_method_for_context-free_tree_languages","4355807_Grammars_with_macro-like_productions","3045967_Tree_Systems_for_Syntactic_Pattern_Recognition"]}
