{"id":"304001335_Computational_Thinking_and_Media_Information_Literacy_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Teaching_Twenty-First_Century_Skills","abstract":"Developing students’ 21st century skills, including creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving, has been a prevailing concern in our globalized and hyper-connected society. One of the key components for students to accomplish this is to take part in today’s participatory culture, which involves becoming creators of knowledge rather than being passive consumers of information. The advancement and accessibility of computing technologies has the potential to engage students in this process. Drawing from the recent publication of two educational frameworks in the fields of computational thinking and media & information literacy and from their practical applications, this article proposes an integrated approach to develop students’ 21st century skills that supports educators’ integration of 21st century skills in the classroom.","authors":["Sarah Gretter","Aman Yadav"],"meta":["June 2016TechTrends 60(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-016-0098-4"],"references":["301200844_Preparing_Teachers_to_Educate_for_21_st_Century_Global_Citizenship_Envisioning_and_Enacting","291334632_Digital_Literacies_Concepts_Policies_and_Practices_Cover_plus_Introduction","283298188_Issues_and_Challenges_in_Advertising_on_the_Web","274467860_Information_Literacy_Essential_Skills_for_the_Information_Age","274309848_Computational_Thinking","316491706_Do_we_really_need_media_education_20_Teaching_media_in_the_age_of_participatory_culture","287350625_Situated_Language_and_Learning_A_Critique_of_Traditional_Schooling","276934602_Media_Education_A_Kit_for_Teachers_Students_Parents_and_Professionals","276855863_Social_media_use_and_participation_A_meta-analysis_of_current_research","276555166_From_Scratch_to_Real_Programming"]}
