{"id":"330483882_Primary_lateral_sclerosis_a_distinct_entity_or_part_of_the_ALS_spectrum","abstract":"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) has been traditionally viewed as a distinct upper motor neuron condition (UMN) but is increasingly regarded as a sub-phenotype within the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) spectrum. Despite established diagnostic criteria, formal diagnosis can be challenging and the protracted diagnostic journey and uncertainty about longer-term prognosis cause considerable distress to patients and caregivers. PLS patients are invariably excluded from ALS clinical trials, while PLS pharmacological trials are lacking. There remains an unmet need for diagnostic biomarkers for upper motor neuron predominant conditions and prognostic indicators regarding prognosis, survival, and risk of conversion to ALS. Validated biomarkers will not only have implications for individualized patient care but also serve as outcome measures in pharmaceutical trials. Given the paucity of post-mortem studies in PLS, novel pathological insights are generally inferred from state-of-the-art imaging studies. Computational neuroimaging has already contributed significantly to the characterization of PLS-associated pathology in vivo and has underscored the role of neuro-inflammation, the presence of extra-motor changes, and confirmed pathological patterns similar to ALS. This systematic review assesses the current state of PLS research across clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological domains from a combined clinical and academic perspective. We discuss patterns of pathological overlap with other ALS phenotypes, examine if the biological processes of PLS warrant therapeutic strategies distinct from ALS, and evaluate the evidence that classes PLS as a distinct clinico-pathological entity.","authors":["Eoin Finegan","Rangariroyashe Hannah Chipika","Stacey Li Hi Shing","Orla Hardiman"],"meta":["January 2019Amyotrophic Lateral
