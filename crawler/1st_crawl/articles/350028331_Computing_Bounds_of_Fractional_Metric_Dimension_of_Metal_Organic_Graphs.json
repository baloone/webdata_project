{"id":"350028331_Computing_Bounds_of_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Metal_Organic_Graphs","abstract":"Metal organic graphs are hollow structures of metal atoms that are connected by ligands, where metal atoms are represented by the vertices and ligands are referred as edges. A vertex x resolves the vertices u and v of a graph G if du,x≠dv,x. For a pair u,v of vertices of G, Ru,v=x∈VG:dx,u≠dx,v is called its resolving neighbourhood set. For each pair of vertices u and v in VG, if fRu,v≥1, then f from VG to the interval 0,1 is called resolving function. Moreover, for two functions f and g, f is called minimal if f≤g and fv≠gv for at least one v∈VG. The fractional metric dimension (FMD) of G is denoted by dimfG and defined as dimfG=ming:g is a minimal resolving function of G, where g=∑v∈VGgv. If we take a pair of vertices u,v of G as an edge e=uv of G, then it becomes local fractional metric dimension (LFMD) dimlfG. In this paper, local fractional and fractional metric dimensions of MOGn are computed for n≅1mod2 in the terms of upper bounds. Moreover, it is obtained that metal organic is one of the graphs that has the same local and fractional metric dimension.","authors":["Mohsin Raza","Dalal Awadh Alrowaili","Muhammad Javaid","Khurram Shabbir"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Chemistry 2021:1-12","DOI:10.1155/2021/5539569"],"references":["346894724_Sharp_Bounds_of_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Connected_Networks","332301859_On_the_local_fractional_metric_dimension_of_corona_product_graphs","330490436_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Jahangir_Graph","323517407_On_fractional_metric_dimension_of_comb_product_graphs","312284531_Application_of_Metal-organic_Frameworks","346976125_Bounds_on_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Convex_Polytopes","346975875_On_sharp_bounds_of_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Convex_Polytoes","343947887_The_locating_number_of_hexagonal_Mobius_ladder_network","341093777_Local_Fractional_Metric_Dimensions_of_Rotationally_Symmetric_and_Planar_Networks","272372827_The_fractional_metric_dimension_of_permutation_graphs"]}
