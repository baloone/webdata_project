{"id":"220188878_Total_palindrome_complexity_of_finite_words","abstract":"The palindrome complexity function palw of a word w attaches to each nâˆˆN the number of palindromes (factors equal to their mirror images) of length n contained in w. The number of all the nonempty palindromes in a finite word is called the total palindrome complexity of that word. We present exact bounds for the total palindrome complexity and construct words which have any palindrome complexity between these bounds, for binary alphabets as well as for alphabets with the cardinal greater than 2. Denoting by Mq(n) the average number of palindromes in all words of length n over an alphabet with q letters, we present an upper bound for Mq(n) and prove that the limit of Mq(n)/n is 0. A more elaborate estimation leads to Mq(n)=O(n).","authors":["Mira-Cristiana Anisiu","Valeriu Anisiu","Zoltan Kasa"],"meta":["January 2010Discrete Mathematics 310(1):109-114","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2009.08.002","SourceDBLP","Project: Complexity of words"],"references":["222679163_Palindrome_complexity","220489364_Properties_of_palindromes_in_finite_words","220185211_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_trees","265350031_On_the_d-complexity_of_words","238204760_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Arnoux_Rauzy_Subshifts_and_Applications_to_Schrodinger_Operators","228922773_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_trees","225706731_On_the_maximum_number_of_distinct_factors_of_a_binary_string","222394930_Episturmian_words_and_some_constructions_of_de_Luca_and_Rauzy","220520647_Palindromes_and_Two-Dimensional_Sturmian_Sequences","220185791_Palindrome_complexity_bounds_for_primitive_substitution_sequences"]}
