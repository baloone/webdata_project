{"id":"3051099_An_Internet-Based_Graphical_Programming_Tool_for_Teaching_Power_System_Harmonic_Measurement","abstract":"Traditional methods to measure power system harmonics employ the power harmonic analyzer or a software package, such as Matlab or others, but they do have certain limitations in the graphical programming environment, applications for remote monitoring and control performance. This paper presents a virtual instrument (VI) that can carry out power system harmonic measurement based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) in remote surveillance capability via the Internet. The strategies and guidelines are also developed to enhance teaching and/or learning the basics of operating Internet-based systems. Critical issues pertaining to engineering education, such as design of course, expected learning outcomes, assessment of student performance, and course evaluation are discussed in detail","authors":["Hsiung Cheng Lin"],"meta":["September 2006IEEE Transactions on Education 49(3):404 - 414","DOI:10.1109/TE.2006.879239","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["220425310_The_Case_for_Case_Studies_of_Programming_Problems","295300473_Precise_riveting_systems_using_networked_PLCs_for_remote_monitoring_and_control_via_the_Internet","262391460_Integrating_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_in_the_Computer_Science_Curriculum","252593717_An_Interactive_Framework_for_Teaching_Power_System_Harmonics","240835260_Precise_Riveting_Systems_Using_Networked_PLCs_for_Remote_Monitoring_and_Control_via_the_Internet","234787236_Power_Systems_Harmonics","230211698_A_remote_monitoring_and_control-based_precise_multilocation_riveting_system","3884391_A_LabVIEW_based_virtual_instrument_for_power_analyzers","3550657_Harmonics-causes_effects_measurements_and_analysis-update","3463141_Power_System_Harmonics_An_Overview","3420636_Programmable_instruments_virtual_instruments_and_distributed_measurement_systems_What_is_really_useful_innovative_and_technically_sound","3420633_Virtual_instruments_and_virtual_environments","3419313_The_Next-Generation_Internet","3355060_Intelligent_neural-network-based_adaptive_power-line_conditioner_for_real-time_harmonics_filtering","3354690_Enhanced_FFT-based_parametric_algorithm_for_simultaneous_multiple_harmonics_analysis","3170096_Harmonic_analysis_of_industrial_power_systems","3169103_Harmonics_--_Causes_effects_measurements_and_analysis_An_update","2772653_Integrating_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_in_the_Computer_Science_Curriculum"]}
