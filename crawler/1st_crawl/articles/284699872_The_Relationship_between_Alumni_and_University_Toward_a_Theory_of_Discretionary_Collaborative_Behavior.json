{"id":"284699872_The_Relationship_between_Alumni_and_University_Toward_a_Theory_of_Discretionary_Collaborative_Behavior","abstract":"This paper explores the long term relationship between alumni and universities. While alumni are not usually thought of as customers, the universityâ€™s continued dependence on them for financial and other resources makes them a useful relationship marketing example. This study examines discretionary collaborative behavior (DCB) performed by alumni and factors that lead to that behavior. DCBs are behaviors performed by a customer to help a vendor, company, or institution, which contribute to the effective functioning of the relationship, which are outside formal contractual obligations, and are performed. without expectation of direct reward. Findings show antecedents of DCBs are: satisfaction with performance, relational bonds, and individual attributes.","authors":["Robert Heckman","Audrey Guskey"],"meta":["April 1998The Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice 6(2):97-112","DOI:10.1080/10696679.1998.11501799"],"references":["239060865_Alliances_in_Industrial_Purchasing_The_Determinants_of_Joint_Action_in_Buyer-Supplier_Relationships","235361395_The_Market_Maven_A_Diffuser_of_Marketplace_Information","233894851_The_Commitment-Trust_Theory_of_Relationship_Marketing","24098436_Measuring_the_Involvement_Construct","279615050_Competence_and_Helping","276995121_Competence_and_volunteering","267922435_Dimensions_of_Opinion_Leadership","254348762_Competence_and_Helping","248007072_The_Service_Encounter-Diagnosing_Favorable_and_Unfavorable_Incidents","247902735_The_Impact_of_Television_Advertising_Learning_Without_Involvement","243448998_A_Model_of_Distributor_Firm_and_Manufacturer_Firm_Working_P","235361594_The_Role_of_Product-Related_Conversations_in_the_Diffusion_of_a_New_Product","235361257_The_Changing_Role_of_Marketing_in_the_Corporation","235275670_How_do_Customers_Express_Dissatisfaction_and_What_can_Service_Marketers_do_About_it","235270459_Interactive_Marketing_The_Influence_of_Participation_onPositive_Word-of-Mouth_and_Referrals","233822680_The_Identity_of_Women's_Clothing_Fashion_Opinion_Leaders","233065611_The_Use_of_Recipient-Based_Measures_of_Service_Quality_in_Business_Education","232531685_Issues_in_the_Use_and_Interpretation_of_Discriminant_Analyses","222244370_Relationship_approach_to_marketing_in_service_contexts_The_marketing_and_organizational_behavior_interface"]}
