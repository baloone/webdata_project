{"id":"275032572_UTAUT_Model_for_Blended_Learning_The_Role_of_Gender_and_Age_in_the_Intention_to_Use_Webinars","abstract":"The purpose of the paper was to determine the factors that explain the acceptance of a webinar system (Elluminate) in a blended learning course by students. The effects of gender and age as moderating variables were also studied. Our hypotheses were based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, which was proven to be able to better explain the variance in usage intention than previous acceptance models. In total, 114 students enrolled in a blended information systems course at Laval University in Quebec-Canada answered 37 questions of seven-point Likert-type scale. Results have shown that the intention to use a webinar was directly influenced by performance expectancy (practical academic performance), effort expectancy (easiness of use), and facilitating conditions (technical and organizational support). Only the age variable had had a moderating effect. The obtained results will not only add scientific evidence to the literature about blended learning, webinars, and technology adoption, but it could also lead to a better practical understanding of the factors that may incite or discourage students to use webinar technologies in blended higher education. Faculty members and administrators should use these results to evolve strategies to align users' expectations with technology use for learning.","authors":["Hager Khechine","Sawsen Lakhal","Alphonse Bytha","Pascot"],"meta":["January 2014Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Learning and Learning Objects (IJELLO) 10:33-52","DOI:10.28945/1994"],"references":["286816447_Mobile_data_service_demographics_in_urban_China","281496333_The_Effect_of_Culture_on_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","328891671_Internet_Banking_and_Customers'_Acceptance_in_Jordan_The_Unified_Model's_Perspective","313706668_Blended_learning_systems_Definition_current_trends_and_future_directions","309254394_Psychometric_Theory","309106130_Hybrid_teaching_seeks_to_end_the_divide_between_traditional_and_online_instruction","308058706_The_theory_of_planned_behavior_organizational_behavior_and_human_decision_processes","303250222_Skype_Elluminate_Adobe_Connect_Ivisit_A_comparison_of_web-based_video_conferencing_systems_for_learning_and_teaching","303245726_Use_of_elluminate_in_online_teaching_of_statistics_in_the_health_sciences","303216158_Students'_acceptance_of_elluminate_use_in_a_blended_learning_course","281274059_The_moderator-mediator_variable_distinction_in_social_psychological_research_Conceptual_strategic_and_statistical_considerations","272790646_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","267415343_A_Comparison_Of_Traditional_And_Blended_Learning_In_Introductory_Principles_Of_Accounting_Course","281221794_Blending_learning_opportunities_to_enhance_educational_programming_and_meetings","277197718_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education_Framework_Principles_and_Guidelines"]}
