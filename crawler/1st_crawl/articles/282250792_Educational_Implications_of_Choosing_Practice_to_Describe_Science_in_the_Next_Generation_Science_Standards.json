Following its predecessors“scientiﬁc method” and “inquiry,” “practice” is the most recent vocabulary choice for ex-pressing an educational aim that students learn how to reason and act scientiﬁcally. Onemotivation for this shift is that, although it may be out of reach to think and act scientif-ically exactly as scientists do, students can be taught, in some basic form, scientiﬁcallypowerfulwaysofreasoningandactingthatcapturewhatisparticularaboutscience—waysof reasoning and acting that develop reliable knowledge claims and are underpinnings ofscience’s epistemic privilege.Previous attempts to articulate semantically what is particular about the reasoning andacting of scientists have faced challenges. For example, “scientiﬁc method\" appeals intu-itively to an undeniable truth that something scientists think and do methodically resultsin scientiﬁc knowledge. Articulating this ran aground when science education scholarsand others (see Woodcock, 2014 for a recent summary) pointed to ways in which “sci-entiﬁc method” does not resemble actual scientiﬁc work—for example, scientists do notfollow ordered steps, and no set of steps are necessary or common across different disci-","authors":["Michael Ford"],"meta":["September 2015Science Education 99(6)","DOI:10.1002/sce.21188"],"references":["268447557_Representing_Student_Argumentation_as_Functionally_Emergent_From_Scientific_Activity","263468968_Reconceptualizing_the_Nature_of_Science_for_Science_Education_Scientific_Knowledge_Practices_and_Other_Family_Categories","254300540_A_Dialogic_Account_of_SenseMaking_in_Scientific_Argumentation_and_Reasoning","250185413_Chapter_1_Redefining_Disciplinary_Learning_in_Classroom_Contexts","248986168_Reconsidering_the_'Nature_of_Science'_as_a_Curriculum_Component","220041136_Scaffolding_Complex_Learning_The_Mechanisms_of_Structuring_and_Problematizing_Student_Work","347561876_Teaching_Scientific_Inquiry_Recommendations_for_Research_and_Implementation","336094686_Consensus_Expanding_The_Scientific_Method_and_School_Science","333018588_The_Fate_of_Knowledge","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","281663636_Science_after_the_Practice_Turn_in_the_Philosophy_History_and_Social_Studies_of_Science","272177757_The_Next_Generation_Science_Standards_For_States_By_States","271919313_The_Scientific_Method_as_Myth_and_Ideal","270357253_Knowledge_and_Power_Toward_a_Political_Philosophy_of_Science","269659804_Progress_and_Its_Problems_Towards_A_Theory_of_Scientific_Growth","265305198_Inquiry_and_The_National_Science_Education_Standards_A_Guide_For_Teaching_and_Learning","263464382_Communities_of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity_CUP_Cambridge","261622394_Guiding_Principles_for_Fostering_Productive_Disciplinary_Engagement_Explaining_an_Emergent_Argument_in_a_Community_of_Learners_Classroom","260823308_Progress_and_Its_Problems_Towards_a_Theory_Of_Scientific_Growth","259132609_Authority_and_accountability_in_light_of_disciplinary_practices_in_science","259123282_Making_sense_of_argumentation_and_explanation_Science_Education_931_26-55","258722786_Teaching_the_nature_of_science_through_scientific_error","248294904_Philosophical_Investigations_trans_GEM_Anscombe","248285087_A_Framework_for_K-12_Science_Education_Practices_Crosscutting_Concepts_and_Core_Ideas","247878390_The_Fate_of_Knowledge","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice","242583979_Communities_Of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity","233290284_Children's_Understanding_of_Scientific_Inquiry_Their_Conceptualization_of_Uncertainty_in_Investigations_of_Their_Own_Design","230360369_Classroom_Communities'_Adaptations_of_the_Practice_of_Scientific_Argumentation","230225308_Identifying_and_resolving_uncertainty_as_a_mediated_action_in_science_A_comparative_analysis_of_the_cultural_tools_used_by_scientists_and_elementary_science_students_at_work","229068136_Cognition_in_The_Wild","227552404_Disciplinary_authority_and_accountability_in_scientific_practice_and","220040555_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation","43299104_Arguing_to_Learn_in_Science_The_Role_of_Collaborative_Critical_Discourse","40421682_How_Scientific_Practices_Matter_Reclaiming_Philosophical_Naturalism","37723960_Practice_Theory","31757721_Engaging_Science_How_to_Understand_Its_Practices_Philosophically_J_Rouse"]}
