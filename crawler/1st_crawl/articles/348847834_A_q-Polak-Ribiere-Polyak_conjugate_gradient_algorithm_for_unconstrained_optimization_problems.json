In this paper, we present a q-variant of the PRP (q-PRP) method for which both the sufficient and conjugacy conditions are satisfied at every iteration. The proposed method is convergent globally with standard Wolfe conditions and strong Wolfe conditions. The numerical results show that the proposed method is promising for a set of given test problems with different starting points. Moreover, the method reduces to the classical PRP method as the parameter q approaches 1.","authors":["Shashi Kant Mishra","Suvra Kanti Chakraborty","Mohammad Esmael Samei","Bhagwat Ram"],"meta":["January 2021Journal of Inequalities and Applications 2021(1):25","DOI:10.1186/s13660-021-02554-6","Project: FRACTIONAL q-DIFFERENCE INCLUSION"],"references":["344178138_A_limited_memory_q-BFGS_algorithm_for_unconstrained_optimization_problems","343965677_A_Modified_Nonlinear_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_with_the_Armijo_Line_Search_and_Its_Application","343667234_Estimates_of_quantum_bounds_pertaining_to_new_q-integral_identity_with_applications","342964676_The_Projection_Technique_for_Two_Open_Problems_of_Unconstrained_Optimization_Problems","342814417_Solutions_of_sum-type_singular_fractional_q_integro-differential_equation_with_m_-point_boundary_value_problem_using_quantum_calculus","340838255_On_q-Quasi-Newton's_Method_for_Unconstrained_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems","343732320_Some_modified_Hestenes-Stiefel_conjugate_gradient_algorithms_with_application_in_image_restoration","342511597_On_Q-steepest_descent_method_for_unconstrained_multiobjective_optimization_problems","342407495_Nonlinear_Conjugate_Gradient_Methods_for_Unconstrained_Optimization","342234736_Conjugate_gradient_method_with_pseudospectral_collocation_scheme_for_optimal_rocket_landing_guidance"]}
