{"id":"283648887_Distributed_Resource_Allocation_for_D2D_Communications_Underlay_Cellular_Networks","abstract":"In order to enable the benefits of device-to-device (D2D) communications underlay cellular networks, two fundamental problems need to be addressed: 1) how to control the interference to guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) of cellular user and 2) how to allocate transmit powers among D2D pairs to maximize the data rate. In this letter, we propose a distributed resource allocation to resolve these problems. Specifically, the interference from D2D transmissions to cellular users is coordinated using a pricing scheme, while a D2D pair competes with other pairs to efficiently reuse the available spectrum. We model this competition using a non-cooperative power control game and propose a distributed update rule to reach the Nash equilibrium. Simulation is provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Nguyen Hiep Hoang","Mikio Hasegawa","won-Joo Hwang"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Communications Letters 20(5):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2498925"],"references":["242596774_Distributed_Resource_Allocation_Schemes_Pricing_Algorithms_for_Power_Control_and_Beamformer_Design_in_Interference_Networks","224676063_Low-Complexity_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Spectrum_Balancing_in_Multi-User_DSL_Networks","224586612_Distributed_Resource_Allocation_Schemes","224198063_Efficient_Resource_Allocation_for_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_LTE_Network","273391397_Pricing-Based_Interference_Coordination_for_D2D_Communications_in_Cellular_Networks","267132783_Game_Theory_in_Wireless_and_Communication_Networks_Theory_Models_and_Applications","261482638_Distributed_resource_allocation_for_D2D_communication_underlaying_cellular_networks","260534464_Device-to-Device_Communications_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","260533407_Resource_Sharing_of_Underlaying_Device-to-Device_and_Uplink_Cellular_Communications","229058134_Convex_Optimization","224242847_Resource_Sharing_Optimization_for_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","220128870_Capacity_Enhancement_Using_an_Interference_Limited_Area_for_Device-to-Device_Uplink_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks"]}
