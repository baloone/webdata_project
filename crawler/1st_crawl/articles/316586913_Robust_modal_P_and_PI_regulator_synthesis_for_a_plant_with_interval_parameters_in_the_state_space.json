{"id":"316586913_Robust_modal_P_and_PI_regulator_synthesis_for_a_plant_with_interval_parameters_in_the_state_space","abstract":"We consider a problem of modal P and PI regulator synthesis for a linear multivariable dynamical system with uncertain (interval) parameters in the state-space. The designed regulator has to place all coefficients of the system characteristic polynomial within the assigned intervals. The solvability conditions of the problem and the proof of the correlation between interval system controllability and regulator existence are presented. The application of the developed method is illustrated on a numerical example.","authors":["Y. Smagina","I. Brewer"],"meta":["January 2000"],"references":[]}
