{"id":"290346396_Exact_person_fit_indexes_for_the_Rasch_model_for_arbitrary_alternatives","abstract":"A new algorithm for obtaining exact person fit indexes for the Rasch model is introduced which realizes most powerful tests for a very general family of alternative hypotheses, including tests concerning DIF as well as model-deviating item correlations. The method is also used as a goodness-of-fit test for whole data sets where the item parameters are assumed to he known. For tests with 30 items at most, exact values are obtained, for longer tests a Monte Carlo-algorithm is proposed. Simulated examples and an empirical investigation demonstrate test power and applicability to item elimination.","authors":["Ivo Ponocny"],"meta":["March 2000Psychometrika 65(1):29-42"],"references":["24062912_The_many_null_distributions_of_person_fit_indices","247742680_The_Power_of_Rasch_Person-Fit_Statistics_in_Detecting_Unusual_Response_Patterns","232282465_An_exact_and_optimal_standardized_person_test_for_assessing_consistency_with_the_Rasch_model","225110756_A_goodness_of_fit_test_for_the_RASCH_model","24063238_Approximating_the_conditional_distribution_of_person_FIT_indexes_for_checking_the_rasch_model","24063006_Constructing_the_exact_significance_level_for_a_person_fit_statistic"]}
