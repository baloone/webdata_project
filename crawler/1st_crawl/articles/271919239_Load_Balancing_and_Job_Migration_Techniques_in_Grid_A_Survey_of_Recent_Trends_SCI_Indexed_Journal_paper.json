{"id":"271919239_Load_Balancing_and_Job_Migration_Techniques_in_Grid_A_Survey_of_Recent_Trends_SCI_Indexed_Journal_paper","abstract":"In this paper, a fault tolerance and QoS (Quality of Services) scheduling using HTF (Hash Table Functionality) in\nSocial Grid Computing (SGC) is introduced, where HTF is used as the underlying SGC to logically manage the locations of\nthe devices. Fault tolerance and QoS scheduling consist of four sub-scheduling algorithms: unauthorized-user filtering, Grid\nservice delivery, QoS provisioning, and replication and load-balancing. Under the proposed scheduling, a device is used as a\nresource for providing Grid services, faults caused from user mobility or other reasons are tolerated and user requirements\nfor QoS are considered. Simulations include the scheduling by with and without HTF. The simulation results show that our\nproposed scheduling algorithm enhances Grid service execution time, finish time and reliability reduces the Grid service error\nrate.","authors":["N.
