{"id":"315473832_Global_ranking_of_knowledge_management_and_intellectual_capital_academic_journals_2017_update","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this study is to update a global ranking of 27 knowledge management and intellectual capital (KM/IC) academic journals.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe ranking was developed based on a combination of results from a survey of 482 active KM/IC researchers and journal citation impact indices.\n\nFindings\nThe ranking list includes 27 currently active KM/IC journals. The A+ journals are the Journal of Knowledge Management and the Journal of Intellectual Capital . The A journals are the Learning Organization , Knowledge Management Research & Practice, Knowledge and Process Management , VINE: The Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems and International Journal of Knowledge Management . A majority of recently launched journals did not fare well in the ranking. Whereas a journalâ€™s longevity is important, it is not the only factor affecting its ranking position. Expert survey and citation impact measures are relatively consistent, but expert survey ranking scores change faster.\n\nPractical implications\nKM/IC discipline stakeholders, including practitioners, editors, publishers, reviewers, researchers, students, administrators and librarians, may consult the developed ranking list for various purposes. Compared to 2008, more researchers indicated KM/IC as their primary area of concentration, which is a positive indicator of discipline development.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is the most recent ranking list of KM/IC academic journals.","authors":["Alexander Serenko","Nick Bontis"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Knowledge Management 21(3)","DOI:10.1108/JKM-11-2016-0490"],"references":["309392598_Publication_Anxiety_Quality_and_Journal_Rankings_Researcher_Views","303782023_Expert-based_versus_citation-based_ranking_of_scholarly_and_scientific_publication_channels","287238287_Examining_the_Transfer_of_Academic_Knowledge_to_Business_Practitioners_Doctoral_Program_Graduates_as_Intermediaries","282310782_Citation_classics_published_in_Knowledge_Management_journals_Part_II_studying_research_trends_and_discovering_the_Google_Scholar_Effect","313429406_A_preliminary_test_of_Google_Scholar_as_a_source_for_citation_data_A_longitudinal_study_of_Nobel_Prize_winners","312277628_Knowledge-Dissemination_Channels_Analytics_of_Stature_Evaluation","309231538_Artifacts_in_knowledge_management_research_a_systematic_literature_review_and_future_research_directions","291391180_60th_Anniversary_Essay_How_Journals_Could_Improve_Research_Practices_in_Social_Science","289505150_Academic_labour_journal_ranking_lists_and_the_politics_of_knowledge_production_in_marketing","279633828_Exploring_the_Role_of_Symbolic_Legitimation_in_Voluntary_Journal_List_Adoption"]}
