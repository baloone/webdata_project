{"id":"322959250_Matrix_Inversion_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","abstract":"The interpolation by method which consists of the representation of numerical data by a suitable polynomial and then to compute the value of the dependent variable from the polynomial corresponding to any given value of the independent variable leads to the necessity of a method for representing a given set of numerical data on a pair of variables by a suitable polynomial. One such method has been composed in this study. The method is based on the inversion of a square matrix from Caley-Hamilton theorem. The method obtained has been applied in representing the numerical data, on the total population of India since 1971, by a polynomial curve.","authors":["Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["December 2016","Project: Ph.D. Research"],"references":["313029722_Performance_analysis_of_a_desalination_plant_as_a_single_unit_with_mandatory_shutdown_during_winter","301691835_K-Means_K-Median_and_K-Modes_-_Special_cases_of_partitioning_multiway_data","296699621_Stochastic_Analysis_of_a_Two-Unit_Cold_Standby_System_Wherein_Both_Units_May_Become_Operative_Depending_upon_the_Demand","318904691_Solving_Quadratic_Fractional_Programming_Problem_via_Feasible_Direction_Development_and_Modified_Simplex_Method","315262810_A_QUANTITATIVE_AND_CYTOLOGICAL_STUDY_OF_GERM_CELLS_IN_HUMAN_OVARIES","314538735_A_Method_for_Solving_Fuzzy_Transportation_Problem_FTP_using_Fuzzy_Russell's_Method","313634398_Fuzzy_programming_and_linear_programming_with_several_objective_functions","312449512_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_without_Candidate_Generation","312018478_ECONOMIC_AND_PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_OF_STOCHASTIC_MODEL_ON_A_BASE_TRANSCEIVER_SYSTEM_CONSIDERING_VARIOUS_OPERATIONAL_MODES_AND_CATASTROPHIC_FAILURES","298415898_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Based_on_Generalized_Prioritized_Aggregation_Operators_under_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Environment","289924194_Cost-benefit_analysis_of_a_single_unit_system_with_scheduled_maintenance_and_variation_in_demand","294758513_A_stochastic_model_based_on_order_statistics_for_estimation_of_expectedtimeto_recruitment","288947806_Statistical_aspects_of_fiber_and_bundle_strength_in_hybrid_composites","287494607_Comparitive_study_of_two_reliability_models_with_patience_time_and_chances_of_non_availability_of_expert_repairman","284220283_On_the_transverse_vibration_of_rectangular_isotropic_plates"]}
