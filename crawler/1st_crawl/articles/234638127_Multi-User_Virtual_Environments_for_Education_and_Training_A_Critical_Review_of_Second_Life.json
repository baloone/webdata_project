{"id":"234638127_Multi-User_Virtual_Environments_for_Education_and_Training_A_Critical_Review_of_Second_Life","abstract":"\"Second Life\" is a popular example of an immersive, three-dimensional, virtual world. Inhabitants of \"Second Life\" often describe their experiences in-world as having great social presence. Certainly there is a good deal of potential for education and training to occur in multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs), if designed properly, especially when the goals involve role playing, simulation, and peer interaction. On the other hand, the author notes, the state-of-the-art of these virtual worlds is such that instructors should use caution, if for no other reason than the steep learning curve for students and teachers alike, in using MUVEs for education and training, when an easier to use alternative delivery system can be effective.","authors":["Zane L Berge"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["288027325_Learning_and_teaching_with_electronic_games","344994553_Educational_Services_in_Second_Life","330235436_The_Unexamined_Second_Life_isn't_Worth_Living_Virtual_Worlds_and_Interactive_Art","326545235_Introduction_to_second_issue","323320986_The_Republic","313529193_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education","295970247_Second_life_produces_real_training_results","294349629_Sex_pranks_and_reality","288874796_The_psychology_of_learning_environments","265866856_Using_Virtual_Worlds_in_High_School_Education_Second_Life_and_School_The_Use_of_Virtual_Worlds_in_High_School_Education"]}
