{"id":"320107397_Mapping_the_knowledge_domains_of_Building_Information_Modeling_BIM_A_bibliometric_approach","abstract":"Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been recognized as an emerging technological innovation which can help transform the construction industry and it has been adopted broadly in the field of built environment. Due to the rapid development of BIM research, various stakeholders require a state-of-the-art review of the BIM research and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to provide an objective and accurate summary of BIM knowledge using 1874 published BIM-related papers. The results show that 60 key research areas, such as information systems, 3D modeling, design and sustainability and 10 key research clusters, such as architecture design studio, building information and lean construction, are extremely important for the development of BIM knowledge. The results are useful for the identification of research clusters and topics in the BIM community. More importantly, these results can help highlight how BIM-related research evolves over time, thus greatly contributing to understanding the underlying structure of BIM. This study offers useful and new insights to summarize the status quo of BIM knowledge and can be used as a dynamic platform to integrate future BIM developments.","authors":["Xiao Li","Peng
