{"id":"38365305_Upper_and_Lower_Probabilities_Induced_by_a_Multi-Valued_Mapping","abstract":"A multivalued mapping from a space $X$ to a space $S$ carries a probability measure defined over subsets of $X$ into a system of upper and lower probabilities over subsets of $S$. Some basic properties of such systems are explored in Sections 1 and 2. Other approaches to upper and lower probabilities are possible and some of these are related to the present approach in Section 3. A distinctive feature of the present approach is a rule for conditioning, or more generally, a rule for combining sources of information, as discussed in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, the context in statistical inference from which the present theory arose is sketched briefly in Section 6.","authors":["Arthur Dempster"],"meta":["April 1967The Annals of Mathematical Statistics 38(2)","DOI:10.1214/aoms/1177698950"],"references":["271805012_Personal_Probability_and_Statistical_Analysis","265398656_The_axioms_and_algebra_of_intuitive_probability","243070143_The_bases_of_probability","38365548_New_Methods_for_Reasoning_Towards_Posterior_Distributions_Based_on_Sample_Data"]}
