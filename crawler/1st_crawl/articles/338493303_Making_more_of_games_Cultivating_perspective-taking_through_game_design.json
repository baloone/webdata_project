{"id":"338493303_Making_more_of_games_Cultivating_perspective-taking_through_game_design","abstract":"Perspective-taking – the consideration of others’ mental states and subjective experiences – has been acknowledged as a vital component of interpersonal interactions and communication across divergent social groups. Yet, perspective-taking is neither simple nor automatic; it requires motivation and practice. Though still a nascent area of research, video games have been presented as means of engaging students in perspective-taking due to their immersive and interactive nature. We offer to expand this view and examine the relevance of game design to perspective-taking. Introducing a multiple-case exploratory case study of two groups' work in a game design workshop conducted with high school freshmen, we examine three facets of game design that position this practice as a potentially fruitful context for cultivating perspective-taking: (i) game design is other-oriented – games are created with the intent of being used by others – and hence could elicit motivation to analyze one’s work from the perspective of future players; (ii) games are an interactive activity that can be pursued over short periods of time, in public, allowing designers to receive immediate feedback via playtesting sessions; (iii) as game design entails translating abstract insights concerning users’ experiences to concrete design decisions, games can function as “objects-to-think-with” in the case of perspective-taking.","authors":["Gideon Dishon","Yasmin B.
