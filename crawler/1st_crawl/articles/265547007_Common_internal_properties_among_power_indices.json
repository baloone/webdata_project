{"id":"265547007_Common_internal_properties_among_power_indices","abstract":"On the basis of several common internal properties among the best known power indices, we consider a subset in the imputation set to which standard power indices belong. This notion originates an interval of power that assigns intervals of real numbers to the players. We generate power indices based on marginal contributions and consider a second notion of interval which contain Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices for every game.","authors":["Josep Freixas","Gianfranco Gambarelli"],"meta":["January 1997Control and Cybernetics 26(4)"],"references":["226788682_Directed_and_weighted_majority_games","226157137_A_new_index_of_power_for_simple_n-person_games","225842020_Postulates_and_paradoxes_of_relative_voting_power_-_A_critical_re-appraisal","239061811_The_Nucleolus_of_a_Characteristic_Function_Game","228108279_A_Method_of_Evaluating_Power_in_a_Committee_System","226933592_On_the_minimal_representation_of_homogeneous_games","226177991_On_the_uniqueness_of_the_Shapley_value","226077914_Common_behaviour_of_power_indices","215665388_Geometric_Properties_of_the_Kernel_Nucleolus_and_Related_Solution_Concepts","38335521_A_class_of_simple_games","28165826_A_characterization_of_the_Shapley-Shubik_index_of_power_via_automorphisms","23536717_On_the_Measurement_of_Power_Some_Reactions_to_Laver","4743632_Value_Theory_Without_Efficiency"]}
