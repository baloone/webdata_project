{"id":"336004002_Re-examining_the_innovation_post-adoption_process_The_case_of_Twitter_discontinuance","abstract":"This study proposes a conceptual framework for innovation post-adoption behavior. The model emphasizes that innovation discontinuance is not the end of the innovation diffusion process but one of the stages. The post-adoption process is portrayed in a manner analogous to Rogers's innovation adoption process, but depending on the type of discontinuance—intermittent or permanent—the respective decision-making process could be quite different. For intermittent discontinuers, the movement through different stages is cyclical, involving multiple stages: pre-evaluation, evaluation, preparation, discontinuance, post-action, and readoption. To provide support for the applicability of this framework, this study compares the post-adoption behavior between Twitter intermittent discontinuers and permanent discontinuers (N = 253). Survey results show that permanent discontinuers are more likely to seek and try out alternative SNSs, whereas intermittent discontinuers are more likely to search for solutions to reduce disturbance. Also, this study argues that Twitter readoption could be a planned or unplanned action. However, this readoption is generally a temporary decision to fulfill short-term needs and gratifications. It does not generate continuance commitment and loyalty to the platform.","authors":["Yee Man Margaret Ng"],"meta":["September 2019Computers in Human Behavior 103(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2019.09.019"],"references":["266938543_The_Role_of_Habit_in_Post-Adoption_Switching_of_Personal_Information_Technologies_An_Empirical_Investigation","261702457_Antecedents_and_Effects_of_Social_Network_Fatigue","258131120_Perceived_Characteristics_Perceived_Needs_and_Perceived_Popularity_Adoption_and_Use_of_the_Internet_in_China","257829886_Limiting_leaving_and_relapsing_An_exploration_of_Facebook_non-use_practices_and_experiences","244071986_The_moderating_effects_of_organizational_culture_on_the_relationships_between_leadership_behaviour_and_organizational_commitment_and_between_organizational_commitment_and_job_satisfaction_and_performa","240072501_Jumping_Ship_The_Diffusion_of_Strategy_Abandonment","47545407_Applying_Diffusion_of_Innovation_Theory_to_Intervention_Development","329052279_A_Model_for_Predictive_Measurements_of_Advertising_Effectiveness","325001972_Adoption_and_Abandonment_of_Matrix_Management_Programs_Effects_of_Organizational_Characteristics_and_Interorganizational_Networks","323296868_Wearable_Health_Information_Systems_Intermittent_Discontinuance_A_Revised_Expectation-Disconfirmation_Model","320589342_Intermittent_Use_of_Social_Media_Facebook_and_Weibo_Use_Their_Predictors_and_Social_and_Political_Implications","277895870_Facebook_discontinuance_Discontinuance_as_a_temporal_settlement_of_the_constant_interplay_between_disturbance_and_coping","276181984_Vicarious_Learning_And_Inferential_Accuracy_in_Adoption_Processes","271724403_Vacationing_from_Facebook_Adoption_Temporary_Discontinuance_and_Readoption_of_an_Innovation","264469872_The_Fierce_Urgency_of_Now_Diffusion_of_Innovation_as_a_Mechanism_to_Integrate_Social_Justice_in_Counselor_Education","262643480_Conceptual_Empirical_and_Practical_Issues_in_Developing_Valid_Measures_of_Public_Communication_Campaign_Exposure","260805790_The_effects_of_personalization_on_user_continuance_in_social_networking_sites","256417931_Understanding_discontinuance_Towards_a_more_realistic_model_of_technological_innovation_and_industrial_adoption_in_Britain","251511560_Beyond_the_technology_adoption_Technology_readiness_effects_on_post-adoption_behavior","242507107_Electronic_Mail_as_the_Medium_of_Managerial_Choice","240482507_E_-_Service_Adoption_and_Use_in_Small_Farms_in_Australia_Lessons_Learned_from_a_Government_-_Sponsored_Programme","239023161_Contextualist_research_and_the_study_of_organisational_change_processes","230359825_Fast_and_Expensive_The_Diffusion_of_a_Disappointing_Innovation","227612851_Suggestions_for_Studying_Strategy_Process_A_Research_Note","220412800_System_deep_usage_in_post-acceptance_stage_A_literature_review_and_a_new_research_framework","220259988_Understanding_Changes_in_Belief_and_Attitude_Toward_Information_Technology_Usage_A_Theoretical_Model_and_Longitudinal_Test","220259977_Understanding_Information_Systems_Continuance_An_Expectation-Confirmation_Model","220208482_An_empirical_examination_of_users'_post-adoption_behaviour_of_mobile_services","220079499_Understanding_Post-Adoption_Behavior_in_the_Context_of_Online_Services","200824506_HRM_Practices_and_Organizational_Commitment_Test_of_a_Mediation_Model"]}
