{"id":"322623136_A_novel_algorithm_to_determine_the_leaf_leaves_of_a_binary_tree_from_its_preorder_and_postorder_traversals","abstract":"Binary trees are essential structures in Computer Science. The leaf (leaves) of a binary tree is one of the most significant aspects of it. In this study, we prove that the order of a leaf (leaves) of a binary tree is the same in the main tree traversals; preorder, inorder, and postorder. Then, we prove that given the preorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, the leaf (leaves) of a binary tree can be determined. We present the algorithm BT-leaf, a novel one, to detect the leaf (leaves) of a binary tree from its preorder and postorder traversals in quadratic time and linear space. http://jac.ut.ac.ir/article_406_49.html","authors":["Niloofar Aghaieabiane","Henk Koppelaar","Peyman Nasehpour"],"meta":["December 2017","Project: Algorithms and Computation"],"references":["337907740_Iterative_Method_for_Recreating_a_Binary_Tree_from_its_Traversals","226525764_Efficient_algorithms_for_tree_reconstruction","319770816_Combining_Pattern_Classifiers_Methods_and_Algorithms","265817899_Combinatorics_A_guided_tour","265781311_Efficient_reconstruction_of_binary_trees_from_their_traversals","259478768_Constructing_a_binary_tree_from_its_traversals","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","226150540_Alternative_methods_for_the_reconstruction_of_trees_from_their_traversals","224202540_A_New_Non-recursive_Algorithm_for_Reconstructing_a_Binary_Tree_from_its_Traversals","221936069_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning"]}
