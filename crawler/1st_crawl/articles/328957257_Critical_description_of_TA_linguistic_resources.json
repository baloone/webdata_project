{"id":"328957257_Critical_description_of_TA_linguistic_resources","abstract":"This paper presents a critical description of natural language processing for Tunisian Arabic. Indeed, several linguistic resources were proposed for the three types of Tunisian Arabic (intellectualized dialect, spontaneous dialect and electronic dialect). We present different linguistic resources (corpora, lexicons and linguistic analysis tools). This study can be used as a quick reference for the scientific community working on natural language processing in general and more precisely those studying Tunisian Arabic.","authors":["Asma Mekki","In√®s Zribi","Mariem Ellouze","Lamia Hadrich Belguith"],"meta":["November 2018Procedia Computer Science 142(2018):230-237","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.480","Project:  Automatic processing of the Tunisian dialect: construction of linguistic resources"],"references":["313035715_Morphological_Disambiguation_of_Tunisian_Dialect","307583922_An_Automatic_Process_for_Tunisian_Arabic_Orthography_Normalization","307583707_Sentence_Boundary_Detection_for_Transcribed_Tunisian_Arabic","301404328_Tunisian_dialect_Wordnet_creation_and_enrichment_using_web_resources_and_other_Wordnets","340815508_A_quantitative_view_of_Tunisian_dialect_electronic_writing","324007154_Tunisian_Arabic_Chat_Alphabet_Transliteration_Using_Probabilistic_Finite_State_Transducers","317555368_Intelligent_Tunisian_Arabic_morphological_analyzer","314034927_A_Hidden_Markov_Model_for_Automatic_Transliteration_of_Romanized_Tunisian_Dialect","301390169_Automatic_identification_of_arabic_dialects_in_social_media","300408875_Tunisian_Arabic_aeb_Wordnet_Current_State_and_Future_Extensions"]}
