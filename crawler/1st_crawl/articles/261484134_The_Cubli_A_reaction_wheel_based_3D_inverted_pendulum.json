{"id":"261484134_The_Cubli_A_reaction_wheel_based_3D_inverted_pendulum","abstract":"The Cubli is a 15×15×15 cm cube with reaction wheels mounted on three of its faces. By applying controlled torques to the reaction wheels the Cubli is able to balance on its corner or edge. This paper presents the development of the Cubli. First, the mechatronic design of the Cubli is presented. Then the multi-body system dynamics are derived. The parameters of the nonlinear system are identified using a frequency domain based approach while the Cubli is balancing on its edge with a nominal controller. Finally, the corner balancing using a linear feedback controller is presented along with experimental results.","authors":["Gajamohan Mohanarajah","Michael Muehlebach","Tobias Widmer","Raffaello D'Andrea"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.23919/ECC.2013.6669562","Conference: Control Conference (ECC), 2013 European"],"references":[]}
