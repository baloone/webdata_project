{"id":"263413896_On_the_non-uniqueness_of_-cones_of_matroids","abstract":"Let M be a rank-r simple GF(q)-representable matroid. A q-cone of M is a matroid M′ that is constructed by embedding M in a hyperplane of PG(r,q), adding a point p of PG(r,q) not on H, and then adding all the points of PG(r,q) that are on lines joining p to an element of M. If r(M) > 2 and M is uniquely representable over GF(q), then M′ is unique up to isomorphism. This note settles a question made explicit by Kung by showing that if r(M) = 2 or if M is not uniquely representable over GF(q), then M′ need not be unique.","authors":["James Oxley","Geoff Whittle"],"meta":["May 2000Discrete Mathematics 218(1)","DOI:10.1016/S0012-365X(99)00358-1","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["248572714_Permutation_Groups_and_Combinatorial_Structures","243088574_q-Lifts_of_Tangential_k-Blocks","221569492_Extremal_matroid_theory"]}
