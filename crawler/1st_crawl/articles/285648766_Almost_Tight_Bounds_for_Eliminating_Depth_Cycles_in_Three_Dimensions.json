{"id":"285648766_Almost_Tight_Bounds_for_Eliminating_Depth_Cycles_in_Three_Dimensions","abstract":"Given $n$ non-vertical lines in 3-space, their vertical depth (above/below)\nrelation can contain cycles. We show that the lines can be cut into\n$O(n^{3/2}\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}} n)$ pieces, such that the depth relation\namong these pieces is now a proper partial order. This bound is nearly tight in\nthe worst case. As a consequence, we deduce that the number of \\emph{pairwise\nnon-overlapping cycles}, namely, cycles whose $xy$-projections do not overlap,\nis $O(n^{3/2}\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}} n)$; this bound too is almost tight in\nthe worst case.\nPrevious results on this topic could only handle restricted cases of the\nproblem (such as handling only triangular cycles, by Aronov, Koltun, and\nSharir, or only cycles in grid-like patterns, by Chazelle et al.), and the\nbounds were considerably weaker---much closer to quadratic.\nOur proof uses a recent variant of the polynomial partitioning technique, due\nto Guth, and some simple tools from algebraic geometry. It is much more\nstraightforward than the previous \"purely combinatorial\" methods.\nOur technique extends to eliminating all cycles in the depth relation among\nsegments, and of constant-degree algebraic arcs. We hope that a suitable\nextension of this technique could be used to handle the (much more difficult)\ncase of pairwise-disjoint triangles. Our results almost completely settle a\nlong-standing (35 years old) open problem in computational geometry, motivated\nby hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.","authors":["Boris Aronov","Micha Sharir"],"meta":["April 2018Discrete & Computational Geometry 59(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-017-9920-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305492209_Eliminating_Depth_Cycles_Among_Triangles_in_Three_Dimensions","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","321066449_Removing_Depth-Order_Cycles_among_Triangles_An_Efficient_Algorithm_Generating_Triangular_Fragments","312891123_Divide-and-conquer_approximation_algorithms_via_spreading_metrics","303907372_Almost_tight_bounds_for_eliminating_depth_cycles_in_three_dimensions","301817640_Cutting_Algebraic_Curves_into_Pseudo-segments_and_Applications","281605794_The_joints_problem_in_Rn","278973478_Cuttings_and_Applications","268007372_Book_Review_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","267695613_Polynomial_partitioning_for_a_set_of_varieties","265386006_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry_A_Survey","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","254844525_Cutting_cycles_of_rods_in_space_Hardness_results_and_approximation_algorithms","244315331_On_the_Complexity_of_Many_Faces_in_Arrangements_of_Pseudo-Segments_and_Circles","242913834_The_Joints_Problem_in_mathbbRn"]}
