A new arc-and-route-based mathematical model is constructed to formulate the problem in which the sum of driversâ€™ wage, fuel cost, and handling cost is minimized. A matheuristic based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) and integer programming is designed to solve the 2E-CVRP-E. The integer programming in the matheuristic is used as a post-optimization technique to find better solutions missed by the VNS algorithm or to construct the least-cost first-level routes. To validate its effectiveness, the matheuristic first performs tests on 2E-CVRP instances and improves 13 current best-known solutions out of 234 instances. Then it performs tests on the 2E-CVRP-E instances modified from the 2E-CVRP. For 2E-CVRP-E instances, the total cost of the best solution found by the matheuristic is smaller than that of the best-known 2E-CVRP solution with an average relative gap of 6.37%. Computational results prove that the proposed matheuristic can find high-quality solutions for the 2E-CVRP and the 2E-CVRP-E.","authors":["Kangzhou Wang","Yeming Shao","Weihua Zhou"],"meta":["December 2017Transportation Research Part D Transport and Environment 57:262-276","DOI:10.1016/j.trd.2017.09.018"],"references":["295813532_Daily_lifestyles_in_the_fog_and_haze_weather","291073252_GRASP_with_Path_Relinking_for_the_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","282524212_Fuel_emissions_optimization_in_vehicle_routing_problems_with_time-varying_speeds","277560639_A_large_neighbourhood_based_heuristic_for_two-echelon_routing_problems","276135717_An_integrated_CPU-GPU_heuristic_inspired_on_variable_neighbourhood_search_for_the_single_vehicle_routing_problem_with_deliveries_and_selective_pickups","275474994_A_Hybrid_GRASPVND_Heuristic_for_the_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Arising_in_City_Logistics","270634816_A_Branch-and-Cut-and-Price_Algorithm_for_the_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","267966062_The_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","260140723_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Symmetric_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","257715512_Impact_of_Generalized_Travel_Costs_on_Satellite_Location_in_the_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","257196433_An_adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_the_Pollution-Routing_Problem","251355158_A_generalized_variable_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_the_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem_with_stochastic_service_times","236040059_An_adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_arising_in_city_logistics","228937506_The_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Models_and_Math-Based_Heuristics","226633051_Taillard_ED_Probabilistic_Diversification_and_Intensification_in_Local_Search_for_Vehicle_Routing_Journal_of_Heuristics_11_147-167","220866806_Multi-start_Heuristics_for_the_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","2851978_A_New_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","312923923_A_genetic-algorithm-based_approach_to_the_two-echelon_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem_with_stochastic_demands_in_logistics_service","309185303_The_two-echelon_time-constrained_vehicle_routing_problem_in_linehaul-delivery_systems_considering_carbon_dioxide_emissions","281566032_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Two-Echelon_Multiple-Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Satellite_Synchronization","270278635_The_Time-Dependent_Pollution-Routing_Problem","269405914_The_time-dependent_two-echelon_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem_with_environmental_considerations","263011733_A_survey_on_two-echelon_routing_problems","260178357_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","257697575_Branch-and-price_algorithms_for_the_Two-Echelon_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","257153506_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_location_routing","251670285_A_comparative_analysis_of_several_vehicle_emission_models_for_road_freight_transportation","242654972_A_variable_neighborhood-based_heuristic_for_the_heterogeneous_fleet_vehicle_routing_problem","233608370_Vehicle_Routing_and_Scheduling_with_Time-Varying_Data_A_Case_Study","227427091_The_Pollution-Routing_Problem","222474461_Variable_Neighborhood_Search","220081291_New_Families_of_Valid_Inequalities_for_the_Two-Echelon_Vehicle_Routing_Problem"]}
