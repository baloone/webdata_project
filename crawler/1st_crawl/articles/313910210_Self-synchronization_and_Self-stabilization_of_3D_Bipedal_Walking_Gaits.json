{"id":"313910210_Self-synchronization_and_Self-stabilization_of_3D_Bipedal_Walking_Gaits","abstract":"This paper seeks insight into stabilization mechanisms for periodic walking gaits in 3D bipedal robots. Based on this insight, a control strategy based on virtual constraints, which imposes coordination between joints rather than a temporal evolution, will be proposed for achieving asymptotic convergence toward a periodic motion. For planar bipeds with one degree of underactuation, it is known that a vertical displacement of the center of mass---with downward velocity at the step transition---induces stability of a walking gait. This paper concerns the qualitative extension of this type of property to 3D walking. It is shown that a condition on the position of the center of mass in the horizontal plane at the transition between steps induces synchronization between the motions in the sagittal and frontal planes. A combination of the conditions for self-synchronization and vertical oscillations leads to stable gaits. The algorithm for self-stabilization of 3D walking gaits is first developed for a simplified model of a walking robot (an inverted pendulum with variable length legs), and then it is extended to a complex model of the humanoid robot Romeo using the notion of Hybrid Zero Dynamics. Simulations of the model of the robot illustrate the efficacy of the method and its robustness.","authors":["Chevallereau Christine","Hamed Razavi","Six Damien","Yannick Aoustin"],"meta":["February 2017Robotics and Autonomous Systems 100(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.robot.2017.10.018"],"references":["322297260_Models_Feedback_Control_and_Open_Problems_of_3D_Bipedal_Robotic_Walking","305523106_Symmetry_in_legged_locomotion_a_new_method_for_designing_stable_periodic_gaits","323025911_Virtual_Constraints_and_Hybrid_Zero_Dynamics_for_Realizing_Underactuated_Bipedal_Locomotion","322783653_Virtual_Constraints_and_Hybrid_Zero_Dynamics_for_Realizing_Underactuated_Bipedal_Locomotion","317137223_Nonholonomic_virtual_constraints_and_gait_optimization_for_robust_walking_control","312113706_Mechanics-based_design_of_underactuated_robotic_walking_gaits_Initial_experimental_realization","307634600_Reduced-order_framework_for_exponential_stabilization_of_periodic_orbits_on_parameterized_hybrid_zero_dynamics_manifolds_Application_to_bipedal_locomotion","303180338_Optimized_3D_stable_walking_of_a_bipedal_robot_with_line-shaped_massless_feet_and_sagittal_underactuation","303094068_A_Robust_Parameterization_of_Human_Gait_Patterns_Across_Phase-Shifting_Perturbations","301404787_Self-stabilization_of_3D_walking_via_vertical_oscillations_of_the_hip"]}
