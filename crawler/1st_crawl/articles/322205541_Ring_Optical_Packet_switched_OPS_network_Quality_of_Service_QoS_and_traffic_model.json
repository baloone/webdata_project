{"id":"322205541_Ring_Optical_Packet_switched_OPS_network_Quality_of_Service_QoS_and_traffic_model","abstract":"Optical Packet Switched (OPS) technology is under study as a promising solution for addressing the rapid growth\nof network-intensive applications having different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. By employing Optical\nCircuit Switched (OCS) networks, an optimized Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), delay and Packet Delay Variation (PDV)\nperformance can be obtained. It is, however, very demanding to offer a QoS comparable to OCS network through\nthe OPS network in order to support a significant and growing number of applications. Thus, moving from OCS\nto OPS network, QoS is a critical issue. Hence, this paper analyzes the QoS requirements of network-intensive\napplications and services. Moreover, the paper derived an expression for performance metrics of a single OPS\nswitch and ring OPS network. It is found that the International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication\n(ITU-T) classification is extended with the new requirements of applications and services. For example, the upper\nbound delay, PDV and PLR of video streaming requires (100 ms, 400 ms), 50 ms and 1E−05 respectively. In this\nwork, these values are improved as delay within 10 ms, PDV in micro seconds and PLR of 1E−07 at full load. It\nis also shown that a Fixed Delay Line (FDL) has to be considered when low PLR is required and when PDV and\ndelay are not critical issues.","authors":["Dawit Hadush Hailu"],"meta":["April 2018Optical Switching and Networking 28","DOI:10.1016/j.osn.2017.12.005","Project: Mobile Fronthual networks"],"references":["238479757_Packet_loss_rate_and_jitter_differentiating_quality-of-service_schemes_for_asynchronous_optical_packet_switches","226497131_Optical_Packet_Switching","220200908_Terabit_Burst_Switching","4054443_An_adaptive_service_differentiation_algorithm_for_optical_packet_switched_networks","3827172_Transparent_optical_packet_switching_The_European_ACTS_KEOPS_project_approach","318295231_Performance_of_slotted_store-and-forward_sSnF_optical_circuit-switched_networks_-_a_simulation_study","317491220_Unified_study_of_Quality_of_Service_QoS_in_OPSOBS_networks","303405538_Fine-Grained_All-Optical_Switching_Based_on_Optical_Time_Slice_Switching_for_Hybrid_Packet-OCS_Intra-Data_Center_Networks","267078921_Optical_switching_networks","242506417_Optical_burst_switching_OBS_-_A_new_paradigm_for_an_Optical_Internet","221577770_A_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_Delay_Jitter_in_Optical_Packet_Switched_Networks","221287252_3-Level_Integrated_Hybrid_Optical_Network_3LIHON_to_meet_future_QoS_requirements","4226847_How_the_packet_length_distribution_influences_the_packet_loss_rate_in_an_optical_packet_switch","4017773_Performance_analysis_of_optical_burst_switched_node_with_deflection_routing","3243757_Optical_Packet_and_Burst_Switching_Technologies_for_the_Future_Photonic_Internet","3240784_Analysis_of_a_dynamically_wavelength-routed_optical_burst_switched_network_architecture","3240431_Just-In-Time_Signaling_for_WDM_Optical_Burst_Switching_Networks","3196634_JumpStart_A_Just-in-Time_Signaling_Architecture_for_WDM_Burst-Switched_Networks","2884346_Optical_Burst_Switching_OBS_--_A_New_Paradigm_for_an_Optical_Internet"]}
