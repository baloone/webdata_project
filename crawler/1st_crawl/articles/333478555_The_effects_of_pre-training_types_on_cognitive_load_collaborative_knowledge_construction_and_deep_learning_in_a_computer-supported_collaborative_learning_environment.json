Pre-training was provided to help learners optimise their cognitive load, build accurate shared-knowledge and achieve successful deep learning. The participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups. Each group received either guided or self-directed pre-training. The participants were provided with three learning phases, which included the pre-training phase, knowledge-sharing phase and knowledge-construction phase. After completing each learning phase, we analysed the participantsâ€™ cognitive load and level of collaborative knowledge. One week after the computer-supported collaborative learning phase, we conducted a transfer test to measure the quality of learning. The results suggested that the guided pre-training is more effective in reducing unnecessary cognitive load, building a higher level of collaborative knowledge and achieving deep learning.","authors":["Jaewon Jung","Yoonhee Shin","Joerg Zumbach"],"meta":["May 2019Interactive Learning Environments 29(4):1-13","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2019.1619592"],"references":["257681191_Enhancing_student_knowledge_acquisition_from_online_learning_conversations","253772914_Nine_Ways_to_Reduce_Cognitive_Load_in_Multimedia_Learning","249400353_Can_Groups_Learn","235671553_New_frontiers_Regulating_learning_in_CSCL","235398855_Toward_a_Script_Theory_of_Guidance_in_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning","226701796_Timing_of_Information_Presentation_in_Learning_Statistics","225767816_Expertise_Reversal_Effect_and_Its_Implications_for_Learner-Tailored_Instruction","220934302_Coordinating_collaborative_problem-solving_processes_by_providing_part-task_congruent_representations","220428354_Semantics-supported_cooperative_learning_for_enhanced_awareness","200772805_Cognitive_Architecture_and_Instructional_Design","48829040_When_Learning_Is_Just_a_Click_Away_Does_Simple_User_Interaction_Foster_Deeper_Understanding_of_Multimedia_Messages","41087510_The_Cognitive_Underpinnings_of_Effective_Teamwork_A_Meta-Analysis","324971439_The_effects_of_representation_tool_visible-annotation_types_to_support_knowledge_building_in_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","317782638_The_use_of_cooperative_procedures_in_teacher_education_and_professional_development","311670204_Effects_of_WOE_presentation_types_used_in_pre-training_on_the_cognitive_load_and_comprehension_of_content_in_animation-based_learning_environments","297590868_Knowledge_building_and_the_quantity_content_and_quality_of_the_interaction_and_participation_of_students_in_an_online_collaborative_learning_environment","265092365_The_Cambridge_Handbook_Of_Multimedia_Learning","236188778_Development_of_an_instrument_for_measuring_different_types_of_cognitive_load","235219950_Cognitive_divergence_The_development_of_shared_mental_models_in_software_development_teams","225131517_Managing_cognitive_load_in_educational_multi-user_virtual_environments_Reflection_on_design_practice","220495795_Computer_support_for_knowledge_construction_in_collaborative_learning_environments","220309170_Productive_failure_in_CSCL_groups","200027355_Group_Cognition_Computer_Support_for_Building_Collaborative_Knowledge","32231149_Fostering_collaborative_knowledge_construction_with_visualization_tools","11149812_Fostering_understanding_of_multimedia_messages_through_pre-training_Evidence_for_a_two-stage_theory_of_mental_model_construction","7906289_The_management_of_cognitive_load_during_complex_cognitive_skill_acquisition_by_means_of_computer-simulated_problem_solving"]}
