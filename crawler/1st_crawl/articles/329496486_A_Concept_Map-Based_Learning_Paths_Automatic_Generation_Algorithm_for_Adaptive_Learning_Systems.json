{"id":"329496486_A_Concept_Map-Based_Learning_Paths_Automatic_Generation_Algorithm_for_Adaptive_Learning_Systems","abstract":"Concept map is an important knowledge visualization tool in adaptive learning systems. The weak concepts of students can be identified by analyzing concept maps to provide learning guidance and teaching suggestions to students and teachers. However, in the current researches, it is difficult to analyze effective information from concept maps when the number of concepts is large and the associations between concepts are complicated. It rarely reflects the learning performance of different student groups, which do not reflect the characteristics of adaptive learning systems. A learning path automatic generation algorithm LPG (Learning Paths Generation) algorithm for adaptive learning systems is proposed. The LPG algorithm fully considers the learning performance of different student groups. Concept maps with different learning features are generated by clustering algorithm and association rules mining, and several simplified learning paths are generated by using the topological sorting algorithm. Experiments show that the LPG algorithm has a good discrimination for the student groups and can generate different learning paths according to the studentsâ€™ learning performance.","authors":["Yancong Li","Zengzhen Shao","Xiao Wang","Xuechen Zhao"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885339"],"references":["326338435_Research_on_a_new_automatic_generation_algorithm_of_concept_map_based_on_text_analysis_and_association_rules_mining","315507389_Studying_and_Constructing_Concept_Maps_a_Meta-Analysis","269670685_Effect_of_Distance_Functions_on_Simple_K-means_Clustering_Algorithm","268512540_Review_of_Apriori_Based_Algorithms_on_MapReduce_Framework","261455561_A_framework_for_interactive_pattern_based_adaptive_recommender_agent_using_concept_map_for_personalized_e-learning_IPBARA","220969519_Development_Of_Concept_Map_Based_Adaptive_Knowledge_Assessment_System","324521539_Concept_Maps_Construction_Using_Natural_Language_Processing_to_Support_Studies_Selection","321121407_Data_Analysis_Support_by_Combining_Data_Mining_and_Text_Mining","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","269410431_Advancing_Personalized_Engineering_Learning_via_an_Adaptive_Concept_Map","257404787_Constructing_concept_maps_for_adaptive_learning_systems_based_on_data_mining_techniques","229043279_Learner_Model_in_Adaptive_Learning_System","223754706_Mining_e-Learning_domain_concept_map_from_academic_articles","222695091_Data_Clustering_50_Years_Beyond_K-Means","220017683_Learning_How_to_Learn"]}
