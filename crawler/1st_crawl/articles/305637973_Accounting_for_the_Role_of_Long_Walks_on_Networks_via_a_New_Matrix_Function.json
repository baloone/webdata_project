{"id":"305637973_Accounting_for_the_Role_of_Long_Walks_on_Networks_via_a_New_Matrix_Function","abstract":"We introduce a new matrix function for studying graphs and real-world networks based on a double-factorial penalization of walks between nodes in a graph. This new matrix function is based on the matrix error function. We find a very good approximation of this function using a matrix hyperbolic tangent function. We derive a communicability function, a subgraph centrality and a double-factorial Estrada index based on this new matrix function. We obtain upper and lower bounds for the double-factorial Estrada index of graphs, showing that they are similar to those of the single-factorial Estrada index. We then compare these indices with the single-factorial one for simple graphs and real-world networks. In particular, we study the problem of identification of essential proteins in yeast. We conclude that for this practical problem the structural information contained in the longer walks on graphs is not as relevant as the one contained in the shorter ones for characterizing network structure. More practical applications of the new indices are needed to extract more definitive conclusions on their use for analyzing complex networks.","authors":["Ernesto Estrada","Grant Silver"],"meta":["July 2016Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 449(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2016.12.062"],"references":["279279147_On_the_Limiting_Behavior_of_Parameter-Dependent_Network_Centrality_Measures","267157137_Updating_and_Downdating_Techniques_for_Optimizing_Network_Communicability","232904094_Analyzing_and_Modeling_Real-World_Phenomena_with_Complex_Networks_A_Survey_of_Applications","230993484_Vulnerability_of_complex_networks_under_intentional_attack_with_incomplete_information","225131531_Locating_and_Bypassing_Holes_in_Sensor_Networks","220665467_Robustness_of_regular_ring_lattices_based_on_natural_connectivity","47278210_Spatial_Network","23784951_A_weighted_communicability_measure_applied_to_complex_brain_networks","5334568_Communicability_in_Complex_Networks","284085746_Network_bipartivity_and_the_transportation_efficiency_of_European_passenger_airlines","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","270367529_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Functions_with_Formulas_Graphs_and_Mathematical_Tables","268628022_The_Estrada_index","265326249_The_Estrada_index_An_updated_survey","254163415_Double_Fun_with_Double_Factorials","232362386_Bipartivity_of_fullerene_graphs_and_fullerene_stability","231292544_Solution_of_the_linearized_equations_of_multicomponent_mass_transfer","230981089_Spectral_scaling_and_good_expansion_properties_in_complex_networks","229347515_A_note_on_the_graph's_resolvent_and_the_multifilar_structure","229331857_Estimating_the_Estrada_index","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","222340849_Topological_evolution_in_dense_granular_materials_A_complex_networks_perspective","220439867_Efficient_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Finding_Chordless_Cycles_in_Graphs","220116521_Network_Properties_Revealed_Through_Matrix_Functions","51989574_Ranking_hubs_and_authorities_using_matrix_functions","51937524_The_Physics_of_Communicability_in_Complex_Networks","45853275_Statistical-mechanical_approach_to_subgraph_centrality_in_complex_networks","45799012_Network_analysis_detects_changes_in_the_contralesional_hemisphere_following_stroke","41668866_Universality_in_Protein_Residue_Networks","41087875_Generalized_walks-based_centrality_measures_for_complex_biological_networks","11323656_Characterization_of_the_folding_degree_of_proteins","7669947_Subgraph_Centrality_in_Complex_Networks","7487401_Virtual_Identification_of_Essential_Proteins_Within_the_Protein_Interaction_Network_of_Yeast","6843838_Protein_Bipartivity_and_Essentiality_in_the_Yeast_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Network","6449379_Topological_structural_classes_of_complex_networks","2132371_Clustering_of_spectra_and_fractals_of_regular_graphs"]}
