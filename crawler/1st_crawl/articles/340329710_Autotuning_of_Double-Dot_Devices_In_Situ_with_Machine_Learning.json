{"id":"340329710_Autotuning_of_Double-Dot_Devices_In_Situ_with_Machine_Learning","abstract":"The current practice of manually tuning quantum dots (QDs) for qubit operation is a relatively time-consuming procedure that is inherently impractical for scaling up and applications. In this work, we report on the in situ implementation of a recently proposed autotuning protocol that combines machine learning (ML) with an optimization routine to navigate the parameter space. In particular, we show that a ML algorithm trained using exclusively simulated data to quantitatively classify the state of a double-QD device can be used to replace human heuristics in the tuning of gate voltages in real devices. We demonstrate active feedback of a functional double-dot device operated at millikelvin temperatures and discuss success rates as a function of the initial conditions and the device performance. Modifications to the training network, fitness function, and optimizer are discussed as a path toward further improvement in the success rate when starting both near and far detuned from the target double-dot range.","authors":["Justyna Zwolak","Thomas McJunkin","Sandesh Kalantre","John Patrick Dodson"],"meta":["March 2020Physical Review Applied 13(3)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevApplied.13.034075"],"references":["337116767_Efficiently_measuring_a_quantum_device_using_machine_learning","328363017_QFlow_lite_Dataset_A_Machine-Learning_approach_to_the_charge_states_in_quantum_dot_experiments","326434706_Automated_tuning_of_inter-dot_tunnel_coupling_in_double_quantum_dots","323217498_A_2_2_quantum_dot_array_with_controllable_inter-dot_tunnel_couplings","321794758_Machine_Learning_techniques_for_state_recognition_and_auto-tuning_in_quantum_dots","319122223_A_programmable_two-qubit_quantum_processor_in_silicon","318959106_A_quantum-dot_spin_qubit_with_coherence_limited_by_charge_noise_and_fidelity_higher_than_999","301848263_Computer-automated_tuning_of_semiconductor_double_quantum_dots_into_the_single-electron_regime","282577210_A_Two_Qubit_Logic_Gate_in_Silicon","272194641_High_fidelity_resonant_gating_of_a_silicon_based_quantum_dot_hybrid_qubit","263773867_An_addressable_quantum_dot_qubit_with_fault-tolerant_control_fidelity","262950756_Electrical_control_of_a_long-lived_spin_qubit_in_a_SiSiGe_quantum_dot","255973020_Quantum-Dot-Based_Resonant_Exchange_Qubit","227859888_Silicon_Quantum_Electronics","225691623_Implementing_the_Nelder-Mead_simplex_algorithm_with_adaptive_parameters","38082227_Rapid_Single-Shot_Measurement_of_a_Singlet-Triplet_Qubit","6873110_Driven_coherent_oscillations_of_a_single_electron_spin_in_a_quantum_dot","1869658_Quantum_Computation_with_Quantum_Dots","335711051_Computer-automated_tuning_procedures_for_semiconductor_quantum_dot_arrays","332163896_A_machine_learning_approach_for_automated_fine-tuning_of_semiconductor_spin_qubits","322418968_Tuning_Methods_for_Semiconductor_Spin_Qubits","321660516_Resonantly_driven_CNOT_gate_for_electron_spins","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311091955_Scalable_Gate_Architecture_for_a_One-Dimensional_Array_of_Semiconductor_Spin_Qubits","302970924_A_Simplex_Method_for_Function_Minimization","271854977_A_Reconfigurable_Gate_Architecture_for_SiSiGe_Quantum_Dots","31050886_A_Simplex_Method_for_Function_Minimization_Comput","7620679_Applied_physics_Coherent_manipulation_of_coupled_electron_spins_in_semiconductor_quantum_dots","1857453_Spins_in_few-electron_quantum_dots"]}
