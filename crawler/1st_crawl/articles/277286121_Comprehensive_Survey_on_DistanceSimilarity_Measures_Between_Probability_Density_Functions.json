{"id":"277286121_Comprehensive_Survey_on_DistanceSimilarity_Measures_Between_Probability_Density_Functions","abstract":"Distance or similarity measures are essential to solve many pattern recognition problems such as classification, clustering, and retrieval problems. Various distance/similarity measures that are applicable to compare two probability density functions, pdf in short, are reviewed and categorized in both syntactic and semantic relationships. A correlation coefficient and a hierarchical clustering technique are adopted to reveal similarities among numerous distance/similarity measures.","authors":["Sung-Hyuk Cha"],"meta":["January 2007International Journal of Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences 1(4)"],"references":["249812973_Introduction_to_Similarity_Searching_in_Chemistry","245545312_An_empirical_modification_to_linear_wave_theory","228525079_On_a_symmetric_divergence_measure_and_information_inequalities","228058014_Pattern_Classification","225035806_Etude_de_la_distribution_florale_dans_une_portion_des_Alpes_et_du_Jura","220696382_Similarity_Search_-_The_Metric_Space_Approach","44691819_Performance_Measures_for_Correlation_Filters","31873102_Enhancing_Binary_Feature_Vector_Similarity_Measures","3080107_Some_inequalities_for_information_divergence_and_related_measures_of_discrimination","312911596_A_method_of_establishing_groups_of_equal_amplitude_in_plant_sociology_based_on_similarity_of_species_and_its_application_to_analyses_of_the_vegetation_on_Danish_commons","308646990_Measuring_of_interspecific_association_and_similarity_between_communities","288945826_Divergence_measures_based_on_the_Shannon_entropy","284759081_An_ordination_of_the_upland_forest_communities_of_Southern_Wisconsin","284400357_Measures_of_the_Amount_of_Ecologic_Association_Between_Species","281345584_On_the_Criterion_that_a_Given_System_of_Deviations_from_the_Probable_in_the_Case_of_a_Correlated_System_of_Variables_is_Such_that_it_Can_Be_Reasonably_Supposed_to_have_Arisen_from_Random_Sampling","269529117_Adaptation_of_Sorensen's_K_1948_for_Estimating_Unit_Affinities_in_Prairie_Vegetation","264928887_Classification_Parameter_Estimation_and_State_Estimation_An_Engineering_Approach_Using_MATLAB","248872278_New_Inequalities_for_Je_reys_Divergence_Measure","247699551_Taxicab_Geometry_An_Adventure_in_Non-Euclidean_Geometry","244958444_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication_The_Bell_System_Technical_Journal","243765011_On_a_Measure_of_Divergence_between_Two_Statistical_Populations_Defined_by_Their_Probability_Distributions","242460971_X_On_the_criterion_that_a_given_system_of_deviations_from_the_probable_in_the_case_of_a_correlated_system_of_variables_is_such_that_it_can_be_reasonably_supposed_to_have_arisen_from_random_sampling","238720710_Dice_LR_Measures_of_the_Amount_of_Ecologic_Association_Between_Species_Ecology_263_297-302","232128574_A_General_Coefficient_of_Similarity_and_Some_of_Its_Properties","226908733_Information_radius","224906906_New_Developments_in_Generalized_Information_Measures","224839945_On_Information_and_Sufficiency","224730474_Kailath_T_The_divergence_and_Bhattacharyya_distance_measures_in_signal_selection_IEEE_Trans_on_Comm_Tech_151_52-60","221985753_On_measuring_the_distance_between_histograms","220679924_Lin_JH_Divergence_measures_based_on_the_Shannon_entropy_IEEE_Trans_Inform_Theory_37_145-151","216814398_Sorensen_TJ_A_method_of_establishing_groups_of_equal_amplitude_in_plant_sociology_based_on_similarity_of_species_and_its_application_to_analyses_of_the_vegetation_on_Danish_commons_Biologiske_Skrifter","201996330_An_ordination_of_the_upland_forest_communities_of_southern_Wisconsin_Ecological_monographs_27","47583918_An_Invariant_Form_for_the_Prior_Probability_in_Estimation_Problems","38367175_Decision_Rules_Based_on_the_Distance_for_Problems_of_Fit_Two_Samples_and_Estimation","3082436_Bibliography_on_Estimation_of_Misclassification_IEEE_Tr_Info_Theory_20472-479","2902680_A_statistical_approach_to_evaluating_distance_metrics_and_analog_assignments_for_pollen_records"]}
