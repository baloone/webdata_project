{"id":"220566048_Data_Structures_for_Range_Searching","abstract":"Much research has recently been devoted to \"multikey\" searching problems. In this paper the partmular multlkey problem of range searching Is investigated and a number of data structures that have been proposed as solutions to this problem are surveyed. The purposes of this paper are to bring together a collection of widely scattered results, to acquaint the reader with the structures currently avadable for solving the particular problem of range searching, and to display a set of general methods for attacking multikey searching problems.","authors":["Jon Louis Bentley","Jerome H.
