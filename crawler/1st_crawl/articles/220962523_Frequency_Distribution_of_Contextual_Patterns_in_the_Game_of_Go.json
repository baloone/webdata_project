{"id":"220962523_Frequency_Distribution_of_Contextual_Patterns_in_the_Game_of_Go","abstract":"In this paper, we present two statistical experiments on the frequency distribution of patterns in the game of Go. In these\nexperiments, we extract contextual patterns of Go as spatial combinations of moves. An analysis of a collection of 9447 professional\ngame records of Go shows that the frequency distribution of contextual patterns in professional games displays a Mandelbrot\nfit to Zipfâ€™s law. Additionally, we show that the Zipfian frequency distribution of Go patterns in professional games is deliberate\nby rejecting the null hypothesis that the frequency distribution of patterns in random games exhibits a Zipfian frequency\ndistribution.","authors":["Zhiqing Liu","Qing Dou","Benjie Lu"],"meta":["September 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-87608-3_12","SourceDBLP","Conference: Computers and Games, 6th International Conference, CG 2008, Beijing, China, September 29 - October 1, 2008.
