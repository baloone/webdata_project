{"id":"257723864_Research_on_Cloud_Data_Storage_Technology_and_Its_Architecture_Implementation","abstract":"The concept of cloud computing becomes more and more popular in latest years. Data storage is a very important and valuable research field in cloud computing. This paper introduces the concept of cloud computing and cloud storage as well as the architecture of cloud storage firstly. Then we analyze the cloud data storage technology--GFS(Google File System)/HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) towards concrete enterprise examples. In the last part, we illustrate how to improve the traditional file storage method based on eyeOS Web operating system which realizes file distributed storage and fault-tolerant control though HDFS technology of Hadoop.","authors":["Kun Liu","Long-jiang Dong"],"meta":["December 2012Procedia Engineering 29:133â€“137","DOI:10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.682"],"references":["240918609_The_Hadoop_Distributed_File_System_Architecture_and_Design","220910111_The_Google_File_System","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220851799_The_Chubby_Lock_Service_for_Loosely-Coupled_Distributed_Systems","220693618_Hadoop_-_The_Definitive_Guide_MapReduce_for_the_Cloud","220439168_Bigtable_A_Distributed_Storage_System_for_Structured_Data"]}
