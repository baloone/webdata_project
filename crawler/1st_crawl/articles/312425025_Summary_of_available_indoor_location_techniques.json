{"id":"312425025_Summary_of_available_indoor_location_techniques","abstract":"Outdoor location is currently mostly resolved. Contrary to this, indoor location have not yet been completely resolved. No global solution for complete range of possible applications is developed. Development of new wireless technologies gives developers a lot of possibilities to solve location problems inside buildings. Furthermore, new approaches and algorithms to solve location problems are developed too. In this article we discuss these technologies and their practical applications in indoor location systems.","authors":["Jiří Kárník","Jakub Streit"],"meta":["December 2016IFAC-PapersOnLine 49(25):311-317","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.055"],"references":["269477745_Personal_Navigation_Algorithms_Based_on_Wireless_Networks_and_Inertial_Sensors","254463064_Demo_Unsupervised_indoor_localization","254462500_FM-based_indoor_localization","254032032_WILL_Wireless_Indoor_Localization_without_Site_Survey","221234493_Indoor_location_sensing_using_geo-magnetism","290781636_An_analysis_of_the_accuracy_of_bluetooth_low_energy_for_indoor_positioning_applications","266056388_Measuring_BluetoothR_Low_Energy_Power_Consumption","254464325_Locating_in_fingerprint_space_Wireless_indoor_localization_with_little_human_intervention","236872236_Indoor_Positioning_Technologies"]}
