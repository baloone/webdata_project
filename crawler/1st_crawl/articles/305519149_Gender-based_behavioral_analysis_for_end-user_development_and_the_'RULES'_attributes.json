{"id":"305519149_Gender-based_behavioral_analysis_for_end-user_development_and_the_'RULES'_attributes","abstract":"Τhis paper addresses the role of gender in End-User Development (EUD) environments and examines whether there are gender differences in performance and in correlations between performance and a set of behavioral attributes. Based on a review of the most prominent EUD-related behavioral Human Computer Interaction (HCI) theories, and the influence of gender on them, it attempts to classify all the gender related behavioral attributes influencing the end-users’ performance. Then, it theoretically selects a subset of these attributes, namely Risk-Perception, Usefulness-Perception, Learning Willingness, Ease-of-Use-Perception, and Self-Efficacy, presents an example application and conducts a basic evaluation testing. The proposed attributes (their initials form the word RULES) can form the basis for the design of EUD-oriented user modeling techniques for gender-neutral self-adaptive software EUD environments.","authors":["Katerina Tzafilkou","Nicolaos Protogeros","Charalampos Karagiannidis","Adamantios Koumpis"],"meta":["July 2017Education and Information Technologies 22(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-016-9519-4","Project: End User Development"],"references":["325671732_Gender_differences_in_personality_traits_across_cultures_Robust_and_surprising_findings","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","314677545_Theorizing_Gender_and_Information_Technology_Research","313313426_An_Evaluation_of_Adapted_Hypermedia_Techniques_Using_Static_User_Modelling","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","309254394_Psychometric_Theory","296668349_The_Web-active_end_user","292733497_Personality_traits_and_gender_differences_in_the_selection_of_academic_major_among_Malay_students","290859897_Theorizing_gender_and_information_technology_research_using_the_individual_differences_theory_of_gender_and_IT"]}
