{"id":"283909804_A_Workflow-Based_Solution_for_the_Law_Study_Process_Management","abstract":"In the context of e-government engineering, legal requirements capture is arguably the most important phase in order to ensure the compliance of public e-services with the rigorous legal basis characterizing public institutions. This step is a strongly cooperative process that brings into interaction three roles with different skills and prerequisites. This paper proposes a workflow-based solution providing a cooperative space for these involved roles and an execution environment of the law study process instances. In addition, it also allows the assessment and the validation of the resulting legal requirements through a law meta-model.","authors":["Amina Cherouana","Amina Aouine","Latifa Mahdaoui"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2846012.2846022","Conference: Electronic Governance and Open Society : Challenges in Eurasia (EGOSE)At: Saint-Petersbourg â€“ Russie","Project: Knowledge Management Technics for Learning in GPM Context"],"references":["224686841_WSMO-PA_Formal_Specification_of_Public_Administration_Service_Model_on_Semantic_Web_Service_Ontology","213883069_Software_Factories_Assembling_Applications_with_Patterns_Frameworks_Models_and_Tools","2697814_A_Conceptual_Model_of_Groupware","283909955_Towards_A_Generic_Approach_for_the_Management_and_the_Assessment_of_Cooperative_Work","282183950_Legal_Requirements_and_Modeling_of_Processes","261052756_Proposal_of_an_extension_of_the_IMS-LD_meta-model_to_support_assessment_of_collaborative_learning_activities","247571886_Software_Factories_Assembling_Applications_with_Patterns","246662430_Le_travail_coopmaoratif_et_ses_technologies","220693629_A_pattern_language_Towns_buildings_construction","2804840_Using_Design_Patterns_to_Develop_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Communication_Software"]}
