{"id":"336977807_A_New_Branch-and-Price-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_One-Dimensional_Bin-Packing_Problems","abstract":"In this paper, a new branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm is proposed to solve the one-dimensional bin-packing problem (1D-BPP). The 1D-BPP is one of the most fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization and has been extensively studied for decades. Recently, a set of new 500 test instances were proposed for the 1D-BPP, and the best exact algorithm proposed in the literature can optimally solve 167 of these new instances, with a time limit of 1 hour imposed on each execution of the algorithm. The exact algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the classical set-partitioning model for the 1DBPPs and the subset row inequalities. We describe an ad hoc label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem, dominance, and fathoming rules to speed up its computation and a new primal heuristic. The exact algorithm can easily handle some practical constraints, such as the incompatibility between the items, and therefore, we also apply it to solve the one-dimensional bin-packing problem with conflicts (1D-BPPC). The proposed method is tested on a large family of 1D-BPP and 1D-BPPC classes of instances. For the 1D-BPP, the proposed method can optimally solve 237 instances of the new set of difficult instances; the largest instance involves 1,003 items and bins of capacity 80,000. For the 1D-BPPC, the experiments show that the method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods and that it successfully closed several open 1D-BPPC instances.","authors":["Wei Lijun","Zhixing Luo","Roberto Baldacci","Andrew Lim"],"meta":["November 2019Informs Journal on Computing 32(2)","DOI:10.1287/ijoc.2018.0867"],"references":["319466126_BPPLIB_a_library_for_bin_packing_and_cutting_stock_problems","266478800_A_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_the_Cutting_Stock_Problem_I","263070332_Friendly_Bin_Packing_Instances_without_Integer_Round-up_Property","262212457_Cardinality_Reasoning_for_Bin-Packing_Constraint_Application_to_a_Tank_Allocation_Problem","228701797_Bin_Packing_with_Conflicts_A_Generic_Branch-and-Price_Algorithm","220669121_Algorithms_for_the_Bin_Packing_Problem_with_Conflicts","220243923_Subset-Row_Inequalities_Applied_to_the_Vehicle-Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","26357291_Linear_one-dimensional_cutting-packing_problems_Numerical_experiments_with_the_sequential_value_correction_method_SVC_and_a_modified_branch-and-bound_method_MBB","2425629_Branch-and-Price_Column_Generation_for_Solving_Huge_Integer_Programs","318828139_A_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_the_Knapsack_Problem_with_Conflict_Graph","301742582_Bin_Packing_and_Cutting_Stock_Problems_Mathematical_Models_and_Exact_Algorithms","275438353_An_Exact_Algorithm_Based_on_Cut-and-Column_Generation_for_the_Capacitated_Location-Routing_Problem","272396389_Two_exact_algorithms_for_the_traveling_umpire_problem","262332677_Improved_bin_completion_for_optimal_bin_packing_and_number_partitioning","262161320_A_Branch-and-Price_Algorithm_for_the_Bin_Packing_Problem_with_Conflicts","261218509_A_new_exact_algorithm_for_the_multi-depot_vehicle_routing_problem_under_capacity_and_route_length_constraints","259513949_Single_liner_shipping_service_design","258052654_Bin_Packing_and_Related_Problems_General_Arc-flow_Formulation_with_Graph_Compression","242814073_An_instance_of_the_cutting_stock_problem_for_which_the_rounding_property_does_not_hold","239550456_An_Additive_Algorithm_for_Solving_Linear_Programs_With_Zero-One_Variables","238836268_Selecting_the_Best_Length_to_Stock","238832707_Exact_solution_of_bin-packing_problems_using_column_generation_and_branch-and-bound","233593513_Solving_one-dimensional_cutting_stock_problems_exactly_with_a_cutting_plane_algorithm","227443623_The_Loading_Problem","227345208_Mathematical_Methods_of_Organizing_and_Planning_Production","226966146_Computational_study_of_a_column_generation_algorithm_for_bin_packing_and_cutting_stock_problems","226310456_Solving_binary_cutting_stock_problems_by_column_generation_and_branch-and-bound","226004568_An_Approximation_Scheme_for_Bin_Packing_with_Conflicts","225858913_Heuristics_for_the_integer_one-dimensional_cutting_stock_problem_A_computational_study","225229532_Branch-and-Price_Algorithms_for_the_One-Dimensional_Cutting_Stock_Problem","223636040_LP_models_for_bin_packing_and_cutting_stock_problem","222743681_Examination_timetabling_by_computer","222633674_BISON_A_fast_hybrid_procedure_for_exactly_solving_the_one-dimensional_bin_packing_problem","222529438_A_branch-and-cut-and-price_algorithm_for_one-dimensional_stock_cutting_and_two-dimensional_two-stage_cutting","222480246_Theoretical_investigations_on_the_modified_integer_round-up_property_for_the_one-dimensional_cutting_stock_problem","221633084_A_Constraint_for_Bin_Packing","221353635_Consistency_Check_for_the_Bin_Packing_Constraint_Revisited","220669016_Optimal_Integer_Solutions_to_Industrial_Cutting_Stock_Problems","220668770_Optimal_Integer_Solutions_to_Industrial_Cutting-Stock_Problems_Part_2_Benchmark_Results","220668735_A_Metaheuristic_Approach_for_the_Vertex_Coloring_Problem","220617570_Worst-Case_Performance_Bounds_for_Simple_One-Dimensional_Packing_Algorithms","220471906_Heuristics_and_lower_bounds_for_the_bin_packing_problem_with_conflicts","220090448_An_exact_approach_for_the_Vertex_Coloring_Problem","29603353_Branching_in_Branch-and-Price_a_Generic_Scheme","4942585_The_modified_integer_round-up_property_of_the_one-dimensional_cutting_stock_problem","2602866_A_Hybrid_Grouping_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Bin_Packing"]}
