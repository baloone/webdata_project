{"id":"343031573_Social_Network_Analysis_Transforming_a_Black_and_White_Approach_Into_a_Grey_Approach_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_System","abstract":"Sentiment analysis has become an important field in scientific research in recent years. The goal is to extract opinions and sentiments from written text using artificial intelligence algorithms. In this article, we propose a new approach for classifying Twitter data into classes (positive, negative, and neutral). The proposed method is based on two approaches, a dictionary-based approach using the sentimental dictionary SentiWordNet, and an approach based on the fuzzy logic system (fuzzification, rule inference, and defuzzification). Experimental results show that our approach outperforms some other approaches in the literature and that by using the fuzzy logic we improve the quality of the classification.","authors":["Youness Madani","Mohammed Erritali","Bengourram Jamaa","Francoise Sailhan"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Information Technology Research 13(3):142-155","DOI:10.4018/JITR.2020070109"],"references":["325227735_Sentiment_analysis_using_semantic_similarity_and_Hadoop_MapReduce","319453659_Adaptive_e-learning_using_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Sentiments_Analysis_in_a_Big_Data_System","309762308_Fuzzy_Rule_Based_Systems_for_Interpretable_Sentiment_Analysis","323056960_A_parallel_semantic_sentiment_analysis","321406412_A_fuzzy_logic-based_text_classification_method_for_social_media_data","318096606_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Twitter_Data_using_KNN_and_SVM","313805674_A_hybrid_Sentiment_Classification_method_using_Neural_Network_and_Fuzzy_Logic","313800419_Public_Sentiments_Analysis_Based_on_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Text","311608900_An_unsupervised_fuzzy_clustering_method_for_twitter_sentiment_analysis","310750120_A_Sentiment_Classification_Model_Based_On_Multiple_Classifiers","276139714_A_Fuzzy_Computing_Model_for_Identifying_Polarity_of_Chinese_Sentiment_Words","261875740_Sentiment_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Applications_A_Survey","303402645_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_the_Sentiment_Analysis_Problem_at_the_Sentence_Level","299420336_Classification_of_Sentiment_Reviews_using_N-gram_Machine_Learning_Approach","277934530_Fuzzy_logic-a_personal_perspective"]}
