{"id":"220313381_A_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_tree-like_weighted_set_packing_problem","abstract":"In hierarchical organizations, hierarchical structures naturally correspond to nested sets. That is, we have a collection of sets such that for any two sets, either one of them is a subset of the other, or they are disjoint. In other words, a nested set system forms a hierarchy in the form of a tree structure. The task assignment problem on such hierarchical organizations is a real life problem. In this paper, we introduce the tree-like weighted set packing problem, which is a weighted set packing problem restricted to sets forming tree-like hierarchical structure. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm with cubic time complexity.","authors":["Mehmet Gulek","Ismail Hakki Toroslu"],"meta":["October 2010Information Sciences 180(20):3974-3979","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2010.06.035","SourceDBLP"],"references":["225123185_Faster_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Algorithms_for_Matching_and_Packing_Problems","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220770041_Faster_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Algorithms_for_Matching_and_Packing_Problems","313196027_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","265306512_Assignment_problem_and_some_of_its_variations","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","223814163_Selection_of_the_optimum_promotion_mix_by_integrating_a_fuzzy_linguistic_decision_model_with_genetic_algorithms","223584006_Genetic_algorithm_for_the_personnel_assignment_problem_with_multiple_objectives","223081752_An_analytic_hierarchy_process_and_two-sided_matching_based_decision_support_system_for_military_personnel_assignment","222678058_An_efficient_parameterized_algorithm_for_m-set_packing","222541033_Exact_algorithms_and_applications_for_Tree-like_Weighted_Set_Cover","220992915_Greedy_Localization_and_Color-Coding_Improved_Matching_and_Packing_Algorithms","220908359_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Weighted_Matching_and_Packing_Problems","220779669_Greedy_Local_Improvement_and_Weighted_Set_Packing_Approximation","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220407013_Greedy_Local_Improvement_and_Weighted_Set_Packing_Approximation","220312468_Collaborative_assignment_using_belief-desire-intention_agent_modeling_and_negotiation_with_speedup_strategies"]}
