{"id":"226225932_Data_Integration_under_Integrity_Constraints","abstract":"Data integration systems provide access to a set of heterogeneous, autonomous data sources through a so-called global schema.\nThere are basically two approaches for designing a data integration system. In the global-centric approach, one defines the\nelements of the global schema as views over the sources, whereas in the local-centric approach, one characterizes the sources\nas views over the global schema. It is well known that processing queries in the latter approach is similar to query answering\nwith incomplete information, and, therefore, is a complex task. On the other hand, it is a common opinion that query processing\nis much easier in the former approach. In this paper we show the surprising result that, when the global schema is expressed\nin the relational model with integrity constraints, even of simple types, the problem of incomplete information implicitly\narises, making query processing difficult in the global-centric approach as well. We then focus on global schemas with key\nand foreign key constraints, which represents a situation which is very common in practice, and we illustrate techniques for\neffectively answering queries posed to the data integration system in this case.","authors":["Andrea Cal√¨","Diego Calvanese","Giuseppe De Giacomo","Maurizio Lenzerini"],"meta":["May 2002Information Systems 29(2):262-279","DOI:10.1007/3-540-47961-9_20","Conference: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering"],"references":["221559479_View-Based_Query_Processing_for_Regular_Path_Queries_with_Inverse","221559364_Consistent_Query_Answers_in_Inconsistent_Databases","221366433_Towards_Heterogeneous_Multimedia_Information_Systems_The_Garlic_Approach","221309626_Integrity_Checking_in_Deductive_Databases","220812011_Verifying_Integrity_Constraints_on_Web_Sites","220566104_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Database_Systems_for_Production_Use","220565762_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Methodologies_for_Database_Schema_Integration","220266329_Data_Integration_A_Theoretical_Perspective","220094994_Data_Integration_in_Data_Warehousing","200043078_Federated_Database_Systems_for_Managing_Distributed_Heterogeneous_and_Autonomous_Databases","200034616_Query_Processing_using_Views_for_Regular_Path_Queries_with_Inverse","3735048_Query_folding_with_inclusion_dependencies","3686664_Semantic_query_optimization_for_object_databases","2943226_Capability_based_mediation_in_TSIMMIS","2761933_Representing_and_Using_Interschema_Knowledge_in_Cooperative_Information_Systems","2715965_Complexity_of_Answering_Queries_Using_Materialized_Views","2650384_Context_Interchange_New_Features_and_Formalisms_for_the_Intelligent_Integration_of_Information","2436008_The_Information_Manifold","2424031_An_Extensible_Framework_for_Data_Cleaning","2358139_Context_Interchange_New_Features_and_Formalisms_for_the_Intelligent_Integration_of_Information","2314287_Catching_the_Boat_with_Strudel_Experiences_with_a_Web-Site_Management_System","257158114_Introduction_to","239592298_Foundation_of_Logic_Programming","223119843_Partial_evaluation_in_logic_programming","222837908_Information_integration_using_logical_views","222726554_Testing_Containment_of_Conjunctive_Queries_under_Functional_and_Inclusion_Dependencies","221559900_Managing_Semantic_Heterogeneity_in_Databases_A_Theoretical_Perspective","221322366_Tableau_Techniques_for_Querying_Information_Sources_through_Global_Schemas","221026225_Logical_Approaches_to_Incomplete_Information_A_Survey","220688293_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming_1st_Edition","220615916_The_TSIMMIS_approach_to_mediation_Data_models_and_languages","220566028_Interoperability_of_Multiple_Autonomous_Databases","220504036_Introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_data_extraction_cleaning_and_reconciliation","220041466_A_comparative_analysis_of_methodologies_for_database_schema_integration","200034171_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming","3845959_Query_planning_with_limited_source_capabilities","3845931_An_extensible_Framework_for_Data_Cleaning","2886152_Answering_Queries_Using_Views_A_Survey","2749718_Tableau_Techniques_For_Querying_Information_Sources_Through_Global_Schemas","2658370_Capability_Based_Mediation_in_TSIMMIS","2420333_Scaling_Access_to_Heterogeneous_Data_Sources_with_DISCO","2413722_Models_for_Information_Integration_Turning_Local-as-View_Into_Global-as-View"]}
