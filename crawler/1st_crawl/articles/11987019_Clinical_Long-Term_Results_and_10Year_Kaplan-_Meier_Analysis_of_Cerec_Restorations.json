{"id":"11987019_Clinical_Long-Term_Results_and_10Year_Kaplan-_Meier_Analysis_of_Cerec_Restorations","abstract":"In a private practice, 299 patients were treated with 1010 full-ceramic restorations within a period of 39 months. The inlays and onlays were manufactured using the Cerec technique, and were seated in one single appointment. The clinical success was observed and documented continuously. Re-examination was conducted 9 to 12 years after the placement. According to the Kaplan-Meier method, the probability of survival decreased to 90% (s = 0.018) after 10 years and 84.9% after 11.8 years with no further loss by the final observation at 12 years. Size and outline form did not affect the success rate. Premolars rated better than molars. Vital teeth provided better results than non-vital teeth. The application of dentin adhesive increased the probability of success. Eighty-one failures were recorded during the observation period. The most frequent reason for failures were fractures of ceramic and tooth.","authors":["Bernd Reiss","Winfried Walther"],"meta":["February 2000International Journal of Computerized Dentistry 3(1):9-23","SourcePubMed"],"references":["313173124_2-year_clinical_comparison_of_6_inlay_systems_abstract","21528801_Restoration_longevity_in_an_Australian_Defence_Force_Population","21024242_In_vivo_fractures_of_endodontically_treated_teeth_restored_with_amalgam","21023347_In_vivo_fractures_of_endodontically_treated_posterior_teeth_restored_with_enamel-bonded_resin"]}
