{"id":"268626172_Interval_translation_mappings","abstract":"Interval translation mappings are not necessarily invertible local isometries of the interval which were recently introduced by M. Boshernitzan and I. Kornfeld [Ergodic Theory Dyn. Syst. 15, No. 5, 821â€“832 (1995; Zbl 0836.58026)]. Our main result is a sharp upper bound on the number of minimal sets such a mapping can have.","authors":["J. Schmeling","S.
