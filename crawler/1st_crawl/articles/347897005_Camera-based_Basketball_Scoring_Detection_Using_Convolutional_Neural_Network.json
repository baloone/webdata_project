{"id":"347897005_Camera-based_Basketball_Scoring_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"Recently, deep learning methods have been applied in many real scenarios with the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we introduce a camera-based basketball scoring detection (BSD) method with CNN based object detection and frame difference-based motion detection. In the proposed BSD method, the videos of the basketball court are taken as inputs. Afterwards, the real-time object detection, i.e., you only look once (YOLO) model, is implemented to locate the position of the basketball hoop. Then, the motion detection based on frame difference is utilized to detect whether there is any object motion in the area of the hoop to determine the basketball scoring condition. The proposed BSD method runs in real-time with satisfactory basketball scoring detection accuracy. Our experiments on the collected real scenario basketball court videos show the accuracy of the proposed BSD method. Furthermore, several intelligent basketball analysis systems based on the proposed method have been installed at multiple basketball courts in Beijing, and they provide good performance.","authors":["Xu-Bo Fu","Shao-Long Yue","De-Yun Pan"],"meta":["December 2020International Journal of Automation and Computing 18(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11633-020-1259-7"],"references":["335056781_CornerNet_Detecting_Objects_as_Paired_Keypoints","333458261_Prediction_of_Basketball_Free_Throw_Shooting_by_OpenPose","333122745_Zero-shot_Fine-grained_Classification_by_Deep_Feature_Learning_with_Semantics","321180719_Single-Shot_Refinement_Neural_Network_for_Object_Detection","316477606_Computer_vision_for_sports_Current_applications_and_research_topics","308278279_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","275538669_Sports_Data_Mining_Predicting_Results_for_the_College_Football_Games","271302414_Football_Result_Prediction_with_Bayesian_Network_in_Spanish_League-Barcelona_Team","262560138_A_Review_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Result_Prediction_in_Sports","261501109_The_use_of_data_mining_for_basketball_matches_outcomes_prediction","258035704_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Sports_on_the_Example_of_Weight_Training","228627143_A_revaluation_of_frame_difference_in_fast_and_robust_motion_detection","220929789_Efficient_Non-Maximum_Suppression","220841301_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Sports_Prediction","343461358_CentripetalNet_Pursuing_High-Quality_Keypoint_Pairs_for_Object_Detection","343456258_Few-Shot_Object_Detection_With_Attention-RPN_and_Multi-Relation_Detector","339560816_CenterNet_Keypoint_Triplets_for_Object_Detection","338506619_Feature_Selective_Anchor-Free_Module_for_Single-Shot_Object_Detection","338503786_NAS-FPN_Learning_Scalable_Feature_Pyramid_Architecture_for_Object_Detection","337999225_Localization_and_Classification_of_Rice-grain_Images_Using_Region_Proposals-based_Convolutional_Neural_Network","334526467_OpenPose_Realtime_Multi-Person_2D_Pose_Estimation_Using_Part_Affinity_Fields","329745476_Cascade_R-CNN_Delving_Into_High_Quality_Object_Detection","328143821_CornerNet_Detecting_Objects_as_Paired_Keypoints_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_XIV","324387691_YOLOv3_An_Incremental_Improvement","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","321589764_Computer_Vision_in_Sports","321512547_Cascade_R-CNN_Delving_into_High_Quality_Object_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","316806619_Sports_Data_Mining","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","305626233_Review_of_some_advances_and_applications_in_real-time_high-speed_vision_Our_views_and_experiences","303416606_Motion_detection_based_on_frame_difference_method","287191467_Detecting_and_Tracking_Sports_Players_with_Random_Forests_and_Context-Conditioned_Motion_Models","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","276866714_Study_of_Human_Action_Recognition_Based_on_Improved_Spatio-temporal_Features","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","269375158_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_A_Retrospective","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","4272900_An_Improved_Moving_Object_Detection_Algorithm_Based_on_Frame_Difference_and_Edge_Detection"]}
