{"id":"221562980_Polymorphic_string_matching","abstract":"Calculational developments of functional programs have been likened to conjuring tricks: enjoyable to watch but often a mystery as to how they are done. This pearl explains the trick. The aim is to give new calculations of two famous algorithms in string matching, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm. The string matching problem is formulated polymorphically, so the only available property of elements of the alphabet is an equality test.","authors":["Richard Bird"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1145/1088348.1088359","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Haskell, Haskell 2005, Tallinn, Estonia, September 30, 2005"],"references":["220896787_On_Improving_the_Worst_Case_Running_Time_of_the_Boyer-Moore_String_Matching_Algorithm","242375104_Introduction_to_Functional_Programming_using_Haskell","234810553_Improving_programs_by_the_introduction_of_recursion","220131101_Formal_Derivation_of_a_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm"]}
