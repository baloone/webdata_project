{"id":"318670936_A_nonuniform_popularity-similarity_optimization_nPSO_model_to_efficiently_generate_realistic_complex_networks_with_communities","abstract":"The hidden metric space behind complex network topologies is a fervid topic in current network science and the hyperbolic space is one of the most studied, because it seems associated to the structural organization of many real complex systems. The Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model simulates how random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong clustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community organization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently developed to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have variable level of attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real applications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model that, differently from GPA, forces heterogeneous angular node attractiveness by sampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability distribution, for instance a mixture of Gaussians. The nPSO differs from GPA in other three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of communities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After several tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate networks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a realistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link prediction.","authors":["Alessandro Muscoloni","Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci"],"meta":["July 2017New Journal of Physics 20(5)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/aac06f"],"references":["325304346_Leveraging_the_nonuniform_PSO_network_model_as_a_benchmark_for_performance_evaluation_in_community_detection_and_link_prediction","321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","319385925_Can_local-community-paradigm_and_epitopological_learning_enhance_our_understanding_of_how_local_brain_connectivity_is_able_to_process_learn_and_memorize_chronic_pain","313465896_Emergent_Hyperbolic_Network_Geometry","311692022_A_perturbation-based_framework_for_link_prediction_via_non-negative_matrix_factorization","305779642_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","333115533_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","316595706_Pioneering_topological_methods_for_network-based_drug-target_prediction_by_exploiting_a_brain-network_self-organization_theory","312544727_The_geometric_nature_of_weights_in_real_complex_networks","305780197_Community_detection_in_networks_A_user_guide"]}
