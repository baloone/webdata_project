{"id":"307644541_SEALMS_SEMANTICALLY_ENHANCED_ADAPTIVE_LEARNING_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM","abstract":"Semantic web technologies have been attracting interest in many domains. E-learning is not an\nexception which also involves with many activities or tasks such as instructional design, content\ndevelopment, authoring, delivery, assessment, feedback and etc. which can be sequenced and\ncomposed as workflow. Web based E-learning services should be focused in this aspect to fulfill\nvariant e-learners’ requirements. This paper focuses on the Adaptive instructional design\nframework in which three significant facets are considered 1) Knowledge extraction from user’s\nbehavior, interactions and actions and convert them into semantics 2) Detection of learners\nstyle from the semantics defined in the knowledge base and 3) Composition of the workflow for\nthe variant learners to satisfy their requirements dynamically. In this paper we have proposed\nSEALMS –Semantically Enhanced Adaptive Learning Management System a theoretical\nframework tracks the learners profile and composes the services for learners using OWL-S.\nModules of SEALMS include intelligent agents which perform a kind of reasoning and deriving\nresults from the input fed, finally personalized workflow has been recommended for the elearner.\nSEALMS is also a cyclic model where the feedback can be taken and reviving process\ncan be initiated from the start to obtain the better results.","authors":["Farida Begam","Gopinath Ganapathy"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.5121/csit.2012.2505"],"references":["237752296_How_to_determine_the_Learners'_Learning_Styles_in_e-Learning_Situation","228944377_Issues_in_developing_standard-based_adaptive_learning_management_systems","228747923_Integrated_Approach_for_the_Detection_of_Learning_Styles_Affective_States","224207489_A_Dataflow-Based_Scientific_Workflow_Composition_Framework","265274521_Learning_Styles_in_Learning_Management_Systems","254047006_Knowledge_engineering_approach_for_constructing_ontology_for_e-Learning_services","242282318_Construction_of_an_Adaptive_E-learning_Environment_to_Address_Learning_Styles_and_an_Investigation_of_the_Effect_of_Media_Choice","236661911_A_literature-based_method_to_automatically_detect_learning_styles_in_learning_management_systems","228849123_Automatic_student_modelling_for_detecting_learning_style_preferences_in_learning_management_systems","221607990_An_intelligent_assistant_for_interactive_workflow_composition"]}
