{"id":"264820246_Effective_pair_programming_practice_toward_improving_student_learning_in_software_engineering_class","abstract":"Pair programming is one of the software development practices in which two programmers working together in partnership using one computer, cooperating with each other on the same problem. Previous research indicates that the pair programming show positive impact on the quality of produced product on the team attitudes and feeling. A formal pair programming experiments were conducted at Yarmouk University to assess and evaluate empirically the impact of pair programming in improving the learning effectiveness, efficiency, and gratification of students in software engineering course. Results reveal that students' gratification, efficiency and effectiveness are increased when pair programming is used. Moreover, this paper shows experiment results about the compatibility between pairs. The results indicate that students who pair based on their skills are more compatible than the students who pair with different skills.","authors":["Mohammed Akour","Khalid Al-Radaideh","Iyad Alazzam","Izzat Alsmadi"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Teaching and Case Studies 4(4):336 - 345","DOI:10.1504/IJTCS.2013.060635"],"references":["309120076_Learning_and_teaching_styles_in_engineering_education_Engr","305526434_Parametric_Pair_Programming_-A_Way_towards_Optimum_Output","257431200_Learning_and_Teaching_Styles_in_Engineering_Education","224516627_The_Effects_of_Personality_on_Pair_Programming","275714345_MBTI_Manual_A_Guide_to_the_Development_and_Use_of_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator","248515753_The_Impact_of_Pair_Programming_on_Student_Performance_of_Computer_Science_Related_Majors","246786627_MBTI_Manual_a_guide_to_the_development_and_use_of_the_Myers-Briggs_type_indicator","237163881_Investigating_the_Use_of_Pair_Programming_at_North_Dakota_State_University_A_Family_of_Empirical_Studies_Technical_Report_The_Department_of_Computer_Science_North_Dakota_State_University_2010","224326159_Pair_programming_for_information_systems_students_new_to_programming_Students'_experiences_and_teachers'_challenges","221592369_A_Framework_for_Understanding_the_Factors_Influencing_Pair_Programming_Success"]}
