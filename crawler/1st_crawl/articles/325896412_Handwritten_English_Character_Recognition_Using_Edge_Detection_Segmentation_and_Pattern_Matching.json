{"id":"325896412_Handwritten_English_Character_Recognition_Using_Edge_Detection_Segmentation_and_Pattern_Matching","abstract":"To convert handwritten character to printed character is a very challenging problem in computer science and information technology. It can save time and makes human's job easier. Handwritten Character recognition is an area of pattern recognition that has become the subject of research during the last some decades and has attracted many researchers across the world. Many researchers have proposed different approaches for character recognition in different languages. In this paper, a system is developed for the recognition of basic characters (vowels, consonants and numbers) in handwritten and printed English text, which can handle different font sizes and font types. The main important phases of character recognition include pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and matching.","authors":["Asoke Nath","Srijita Kabasi","Kausturi Chakraborti"],"meta":["June 2018"],"references":["268497597_Fundamentals_Of_Artificial_Neural_Networks","253515967_Handwriting_Recognition_Systems_An_Overview","239765657_Offline_handwritten_character_recognition_using_neural_network"]}
