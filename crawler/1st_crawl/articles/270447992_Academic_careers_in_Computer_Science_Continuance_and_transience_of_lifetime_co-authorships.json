{"id":"270447992_Academic_careers_in_Computer_Science_Continuance_and_transience_of_lifetime_co-authorships","abstract":"Scholarly publications reify fruitful collaborations between co-authors. A branch of research in the science studies focuses on analyzing the co-authorship networks of established scientists. Such studies tell us about how their collaborations developed through their careers. This paper updates previous work by reporting a transversal and a longitudinal studies spanning the lifelong careers of a cohort of researchers from the DBLP bibliographic database. We mined 3,860 researchers’ publication records to study the evolution patterns of their co-authorships. Two features of co-authors were considered: (1) their expertise, and (2) the history of their partnerships with the sampled researchers. Our findings reveal the ephemeral nature of most collaborations: 70 % of the new co-authors were only one-shot partners since they did not appear to collaborate on any further pub- lications. Overall, researchers consistently extended their co-authorships (1) by steadily enrolling beginning researchers (i.e., people who had never published before), and (2) by increasingly working with confirmed researchers with whom they already collaborated.","authors":["Guillaume Cabanac","Gilles Hubert","Béatrice Milard"],"meta":["January 2015Scientometrics
