{"id":"268420637_On_the_Equivalence_of_Prerake_and_Transmit_Matched_Filter","abstract":"Similar to linear receive processing we assume for linear transmit processing that the transmitter completely knows the channel impulse responses to the different receivers for linear transmit processing. Contrary to linear receive processing where three basic types, namely matched filter, zero-forcing filter, and Wiener filter, are well researched and understood, for linear transmit processing only the zero-forcing variant has been identified. The prerake concept seems to be a good candidate for the transmit matched filter, since it simply moves the receive channel matched filter to the transmitter. We will show that this intuitive system design for transmit processing is equivalent to matched filtering for receive processing.","authors":["Michael Joham","W Utschick","Josef Nossek"],"meta":[],"references":["3870409_Downlink_processing_for_mitigation_of_intracell_interference_in_DS-CDMA_systems","269697573_Detection_of_Signals_in_Noise","262635867_Detection_of_Signals_in_Noise","242624905_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Vol_II_Detection_Theory","232644152_Multiuser_blind_channel_estimation_and_spatial_channel_pre-equalization","3880453_Joint_predistortion_and_transmit_diversity","3870417_Joint_transmission_JT_an_alternative_rationale_for_the_downlink_of_time_division_CDMA_using_multi-element_transmit_antennas","3617828_Pre-RAKE_diversity_combining_in_time_division_duplex_CDMA_mobile_communications","3604144_Pre-RAKE_diversity_combination_for_direct_sequence_spread_spectrum_communication_systems","3343974_Time-division_duplex_CDMA_communication"]}
