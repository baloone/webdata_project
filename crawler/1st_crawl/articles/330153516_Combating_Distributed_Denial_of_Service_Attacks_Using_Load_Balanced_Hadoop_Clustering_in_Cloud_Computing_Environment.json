{"id":"330153516_Combating_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_Using_Load_Balanced_Hadoop_Clustering_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment","abstract":"The Security threats in the cloud computing are drastically growing as the number of cloud resource usages are increasing continuously for various services. The analysis is significant as the rate of increase of DDOS attacks has been increasing over the past few years and no effective system has yet been developed to safeguard our systems against potential attackers. It presents a highlight of the challenges, which are caused by these attacks, and discusses the various scenarios of tackling them. It recognizes the limitation and strengths of each strategy, which have been introduced thus far to combat DDOS attacks. This paper provides the existing countermeasures under one roof and discusses the effectiveness of each methodology. This survey will help in the further development of measures to reduce and eventually prevent DDOS attacks, thereby making the Internet a more secure network. This paper analyzes and reviews various methods used to mitigate distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks by using load balanced hadoop clustering mechanism to filter HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests to avoid and fight against DDOS attacks.","authors":["Kaushik Sekaran","G.
