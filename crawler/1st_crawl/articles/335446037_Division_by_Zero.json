{"id":"335446037_Division_by_Zero","abstract":"The idea that, as opposed to the conventional viewpoint, division by zero may produce a meaningful result, is long standing and has attracted interest from many sides. We provide a survey of some options for the defining an outcome for the application of division in case the second argument equals zero. The survey is limited by a combination of simplifying assumptions which are grouped together in the idea of a premeadow, which generalises the notion of a transfield.","authors":["Jan Bergstra"],"meta":["June 2019Transmathematica","DOI:10.36285/tm.v0i0.17"],"references":["319864174_On_the_Operation_of_Division_by_Zero_in_Bhaskara's_Framework_Survey_Criticisms_Modifications_and_Justifications","290111155_Reality_of_the_Division_by_Zero_z0_0","282906250_Subvarieties_of_the_Variety_of_Meadows","266036168_Free_algebras_over_all_fields_and_pseudo-fields","263471497_Division_by_Zero_in_Common_Meadows","283117920_Transformation_of_fractions_into_simple_fractions_in_divisive_meadows","277808991_Partiality_and_Choice_Foundational_Contributions","268451688_Fracpairs_fractions_over_a_reduced_commutative_ring","262974724_Division_by_zero_in_non-involutive_meadows","258082303_Equations_for_formally_real_meadows","249812219_Perspex_Machine_VIII_axioms_of_transreal_arithmetic","234800298_The_rational_numbers_as_an_abstract_data_type","223347614_The_meaning_of_infinity_in_calculus_and_computer_algebra_systems","243113671_Equational_theories_and_universal_theories_of_fields","222830597_Meadows_and_the_equational_specification_of_division"]}
