{"id":"325462917_Flourishing_AI_research_and_industry","abstract":"Matthew Hutson wrote an article entitled “Boycott highlights AI’s publishing rebellion.” The boycott indicates a strong movement of “open access” and “against author-fee publications.” Launching a new journal called “Nature Machine Learning (NML)” from January 2019 means that Springer Nature is serious about AI research and the AI influences to our society. NML will be able to contribute to AI research and industry although it is not “open access” but expensive author-fee publications, because Springer Nature is one of top journals in the world. In the last decade, Springer Nature has published few papers on computer science/engineering. It will be a good chance for computer scientists / engineers to publish in NML. Researchers would like to access to open-access journals that are free to read but authors must pay to publish in NML. Nobody can stop advancing the technology including AI. Many researchers would like to be distinguished by publishing in the top journals. Reviewers in Nature journals can read others reviews, which improves the quality of researchers through reviewing. Nature Machine Learning will be able to contribute for flourishing AI research and industry, although personally I don’t like the expensive author-fee publications.","authors":["Yoshiyasu Takefuji"],"meta":["May 2018Science","Project: science"],"references":["325208087_Boycott_highlights_AI's_publishing_rebellion"]}
