{"id":"283778637_Industrial_Agents","abstract":"Industrial applications have been going through significant changes in recent times. In particular, the trend toward globalization has changed the game significantly. Global business means global competition, which requires shorter product life cycles. In consumer-oriented businesses especially, this leads to a trend toward highly customized and individualized products. This imposes a number of profound and far-reaching demands on modern industrial manufacturing systems such as adaptability, agility, responsiveness, robustness, flexibility/reconfigurability, dynamic optimization, openness to new innovations, and, in some environments, continuously varying collaborations. Such goals can only be achieved if massively software-controlled integrated industrial manufacturing tools, machines, and environments become the default. In many cases, typical standalone, compartmentalized operations need to move toward decentralized, distributed, and networked manufacturing system architectures with intensive communication and collaboration, especially over long distances. For such complex systems, in order to work efficiently, a high level of understanding is necessary, which translates into a reasonable understanding of domain-specific semantics. Multi-agent-based application systems seem to be a promising and natural realization choice. Multi-agent systems (MASs) provide, among other things, decentralized architecture and decision making, modularity, robustness, flexibility, and adaptability to changes. This chapter provides a concise introduction into agent technology for industrial applications that rely on decentralized decision making and control. It concentrates on industrial applications, its evolvement, the consequences of this evolvement on modern industrial application systems, and the specific aspects and requirements on (multi-)agent-based industrial application systems. It, especially, also discusses the holonic paradigm and challenges and research areas for industrial MASs.","authors":["Rainer Unland"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-800341-1.00002-4","In book: Industrial Agents: Emerging Applications of Software Agents in Industry (pp.23-44)Edition: 1stPublisher: Elsevier Publ.
