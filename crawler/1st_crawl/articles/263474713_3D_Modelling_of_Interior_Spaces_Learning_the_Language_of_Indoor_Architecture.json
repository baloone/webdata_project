{"id":"263474713_3D_Modelling_of_Interior_Spaces_Learning_the_Language_of_Indoor_Architecture","abstract":"3D models of indoor environments are important in many applications, but they usually exist only for newly constructed buildings.\nAutomated approaches to modelling indoor environments from imagery and/or point clouds can make the process easier, faster and\ncheaper. We present an approach to 3D indoor modelling based on a shape grammar. We demonstrate that interior spaces can be\nmodelled by iteratively placing, connecting and merging cuboid shapes. We also show that the parameters and sequence of grammar\nrules can be learned automatically from a point cloud. Experiments with simulated and real point clouds show promising results, and\nindicate the potential of the method in 3D modelling of large indoor environments.","authors":["Kourosh Khoshelham","Lucia Díaz Vilariño"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-321-2014","Conference: ISPRS Technical Commission V SymposiumAt: Riva del Garda (Italy)","Project: Indoor mapping, modeling and localization"],"references":["275771902_Empirical_mode_decomposition_transform_for_spatial_analysis","257371506_Automatic_Creation_of_Semantically_Rich_3D_Building_Models_from_Laser_Scanner_Data","242519303_Statistical_Reconstruction_of_Indoor_Scenes","235740409_Automatic_Method_for_Building_Indoor_Boundary_Models_from_Dense_Point_Clouds_Collected_by_Laser_Scanners","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","262293358_Reconstructing_the_World's_Museums","261387534_Planar_3D_modeling_of_building_interiors_from_point_cloud_data","260483974_Indoor_Scene_Reconstruction_using_Feature_Sensitive_Primitive_Extraction_and_Graph-cut","256855114_Semantic_as-built_3D_models_including_shades_for_the_evaluation_of_solar_influence_on_buildings","234810959_Shape_Talking_about_Seeing_and_Doing"]}
