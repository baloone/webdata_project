{"id":"262288172_Anytime_algorithms_for_multi-agent_visibility-based_pursuit-evasion_games","abstract":"We investigate algorithms for playing multi-agent visibility-based pursuit-evasion games. A team of pursuers attempts to maintain visibility contact with an evader who actively avoids tracking. We aim for applicability of the algorithms in real-world scenarios; hence, we impose hard constraints on the run-time of the algorithms and we evaluate them in a simulation model based on a real-world urban area. We compare Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and iterative deepening minimax algorithms running on the information-set tree of the imperfect-information game. The experimental results demonstrate that both methods create comparable good strategies for the pursuer, while the later performs better in creating the evader's strategy.","authors":["Viliam Lis√Ω","Branislav Bosansky","Michal Pechoucek"],"meta":["June 2012","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 3"],"references":["234024974_Optimal_policy_in_discrete_pursuit-evasion_games","224460066_Scalable_and_Practical_Pursuit-Evasion","221455698_Strategy_generation_in_multi-agent_imperfect-information_pursuit_games","221112399_Bandit_Based_Monte-Carlo_Planning","3299275_Probabilistic_pursuit-evasion_games_Theory_implementation_and_experimental_evaluation","265577163_Paranoia_versus_Overconfidence_in_Imperfect-_Information_Games","225755631_On_the_Existence_of_Nash_Equilibrium_for_a_Two_Player_Pursuit-Evasion_Game_with_Visibility_Constraints","223233727_Tracking_an_unpredictable_target_among_occluding_obstacles_under_localization_uncertainties","222702177_Robot_team_coordination_for_target_tracking_using_fuzzy_logic_controller_in_game_theoretic_framework","222396003_The_challenge_of_poker","221606638_Overconfidence_or_Paranoia_Search_in_Imperfect-Information_Games","220814646_Accelerating_Best_Response_Calculation_in_Large_Extensive_Games","220545992_Monte_Carlo_tree_search_in_Kriegspiel","220437221_Fuego_-_An_Open-Source_Framework_for_Board_Games_and_Go_Engine_Based_on_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search","220122310_On_the_Existence_of_Nash_Equilibrium_for_a_Two-player_Pursuit--Evasion_Game_with_Visibility_Constraints","3701875_Motion_strategies_for_maintaining_visibility_of_a_moving_target"]}
