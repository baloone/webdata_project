{"id":"335105303_Blockchain_applications_in_supply_chains_transport_and_logistics_a_systematic_review_of_the_literature","abstract":"This paper presents current academic and industrial frontiers on blockchain application in supply chain, logistics and transport management. We conduct a systematic review of the literature and find four main clusters in the co-citation analysis, namely Technology, Trust, Trade, and Traceability/Transparency. For each cluster, and based on the pool of articles included in it, we apply an inductive method of reasoning and discuss the emerging themes and applications of blockchains for supply chains, logistics and transport. We conclude by discussing the main themes for future research on blockchain technology and its application in industry and services.","authors":["Mehrdokht Pournader"],"meta":["August
