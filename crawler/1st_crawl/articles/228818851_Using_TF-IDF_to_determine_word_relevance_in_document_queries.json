{"id":"228818851_Using_TF-IDF_to_determine_word_relevance_in_document_queries","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the results of applying Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to determine what words in a corpus of documents might be more favorable to use in a query. As the term implies, TF-IDF calculates values for each word in a document through an inverse proportion of the frequency of the word in a particular document to the percentage of documents the word appears in. Words with high TF-IDF numbers imply a strong relationship with the document they appear in, suggesting that if that word were to appear in a query, the document could be of interest to the user. We provide evidence that this simple algorithm efficiently categorizes relevant words that can enhance query retrieval.","authors":["Juan Ramos"],"meta":["January 2003"],"references":["2817793_Cross-Language_Text_Retrieval_With_Three_Languages","220228998_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","2849628_Information_retrieval_as_statistical_translation_Annual_ACM_Conf","2537495_Reexamining_tfidf_based_information_retrieval_with_Genetic_Programming"]}
