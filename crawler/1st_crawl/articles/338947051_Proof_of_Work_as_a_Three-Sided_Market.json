{"id":"338947051_Proof_of_Work_as_a_Three-Sided_Market","abstract":"Blockchain technology is the distributed ledger technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We apply Oliver Williamson's transactions cost analysis to a proof of work blockchain consensus mechanism. Blockchains reduce the costs of opportunism, but are not “trustless.” We show that blockchains are trust machines. Blockchains provide for three-sided bargaining that convert energy-intensive computation into economically-valuable trust in a proof of work context.","authors":["Chris Berg","Sinclair Davidson","Jason Potts"],"meta":["January 2020Frontiers in Blockchain 3","DOI:10.3389/fbloc.2020.00002"],"references":["329400758_The_Cost_of_Trust_A_Pilot_Study","329132126_Smart_Contracts_and_Transaction_Costs","335554264_Understanding_the_Blockchain_Economy","332087139_The_Blockchain_and_the_New_Architecture_of_Trust","323931591_Trustworthy_computing_at_APL","322580171_Blockchains_and_the_economic_institutions_of_capitalism","317219890_Corporate_Governance_and_Blockchains","301604099_Blockchain_Technology_Principles_and_Applications","274650549_The_Economic_Institutions_of_Capitalism","240319696_The_market_for_lemons_Quality_and_the_market_mechanism"]}
