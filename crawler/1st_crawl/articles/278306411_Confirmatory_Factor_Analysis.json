{"id":"278306411_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis","abstract":"Confirmatory factor analysis is a statistical technique used when investigating the structure of multivariate data. Each of a set of n observed variables is represented as a linear combination of m (m < n) unobserved latent variables or factors, plus an independent error term. The n × n covariance matrix corresponding to the n-dimensional observed variables contains the individual variable variances on the diagonal, and the covariances for all pairs of the individual observed variables in the corresponding off-diagonal positions. A matrix equation, called the covariance equation, relates this n × n covariance matrix to the matrix whose n rows correspond to the coefficients of the m latent factors referred to as factor loadings, and the covariance matrices of the unobserved latent factors and the errors.","authors":["Richard J.
