{"id":"324644683_Third_derivative_modification_of_k-step_block_Falkner_methods_for_the_numerical_solution_of_second_order_initial-value_problems","abstract":"This paper is devoted to the development and analysis of a modified family of Falkner-type methods for solving differential systems of second-order initial-value problems. The approaches of collocation and interpolation are adopted to derive the new methods. These modified methods are implemented in block form to obtain the numerical solutions to the considered problems. The study of the properties of the proposed block Falkner-type methods reveals that they are consistent and zero-stable, and thus, convergent. From the stability analysis, it could be seen that the proposed Falkner methods have non-empty stability regions for k=2,3,4. Some numerical test are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed family.","authors":["Higinio Ramos","Mufutau Rufai"],"meta":["September 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 333:231-245","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.03.098","Project: Numerical methods for solving IVPs"],"references":["333808646_P_A_AN_EFFICIENT_ONE-EIGHT_STEP_HYBRID_BLOCK_METHOD_FOR_SOLVING_SECOND_ORDER_INITIAL_VALUE_PROBLEMS_OF_ODES","333189401_Continuous_Hybrid_Multistep_Methods_with_Legendre_Basis_Function_for_Direct_Treatment_of_Second_Order_Stiff_ODEs","305099177_An_efficient_variable_step-size_rational_Falkner-type_method_for_solving_the_special_second-order_IVP","290476994_A_unified_approach_for_the_development_of_-step_block_Falkner-type_methods_for_solving_general_second-order_initial-value_problems_in_ODEs","287402781_A_New_One-Twelfth_Step_Continuous_Block_Method_for_the_Solution_of_Modeled_Problems_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","282956849_An_optimized_two-step_hybrid_block_method_for_solving_general_second_order_initial-value_problems_of_the_form_y_f_x_y_y_'","277922613_An_efficient_hybrid_numerical_scheme_for_solvinggeneral_second_order_initial_value_problems_IVPs","275556201_An_Accurate_Block_Hybrid_Collocation_Method_for_Third_Order_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","284654090_New_linear_mutlistep_methods_with_continuous_coefficients_for_first_order_initial_value_problems","275044174_A_new_mesh_selection_strategy_with_stiffness_detection_for_explicit_Runge-Kutta_methods"]}
