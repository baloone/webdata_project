{"id":"349447663_The_Scope_of_Input-Process-Output_Diagrams_in_Teaching_Economics","abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the scope of input-process-output diagrams in teaching introductory economics. Research shows that teachers and students both benefit when visual aids are used in classrooms. Hence the simple and familiar visual nature of input-process-output diagrams can benefit the teaching and learning of important economic concepts, such as production, concepts related to production and economic modeling. In addition, since input-process-output diagrams are also used in other areas of study, such as computer science and business studies, its use in economics classrooms and textbooks can lead to easier and better understanding.","authors":["Nabeel Iqbal"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.14662/IJARER2021.015"],"references":["257714690_A_study_to_analyze_the_effectiveness_of_audio_visual_aids_in_teaching_learning_process_at_uvniversity_level"]}
