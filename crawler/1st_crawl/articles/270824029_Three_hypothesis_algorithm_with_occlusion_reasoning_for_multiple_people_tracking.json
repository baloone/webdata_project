{"id":"270824029_Three_hypothesis_algorithm_with_occlusion_reasoning_for_multiple_people_tracking","abstract":"This work proposes a detection-based tracking algorithm able to locate and keep the identity of multiple\npeople, who may be occluded, in uncontrolled stationary environments. Our algorithm builds a tracking graph\nthat models spatio-temporal relationships among attributes of interacting people to predict and resolve partial\nand total occlusions. When a total occlusion occurs, the algorithm generates various hypotheses about the\nlocation of the occluded person considering three cases: (a) the person keeps the same direction and speed,\n(b) the person follows the direction and speed of the occluder, and (c) the person remains motionless during\nocclusion. By analyzing the graph, our algorithm can detect trajectories produced by false alarms and estimate\nthe location of missing or occluded people. Our algorithm performs acceptably under complex conditions, such\nas partial visibility of individuals getting inside or outside the scene, continuous interactions and occlusions\namong people, wrong or missing information on the detection of persons, as well as variation of the personâ€™s\nappearance due to illumination changes and background-clutter distracters. Our algorithm was evaluated on\ntest sequences in the field of intelligent surveillance achieving an overall precision of 93%. Results show\nthat our tracking algorithm outperforms even trajectory-based state-of-the-art algorithms.","authors":["Carolina Reta","Leopoldo Altamirano Robles","Jesus A.
