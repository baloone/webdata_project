{"id":"315965278_A_triangular_radial_cubic_spline_deformation_model_for_efficient_3D_beating_heart_tracking","abstract":"A novel deformable model is proposed for efficient 3D visual tracking of beating heart. The model is parameterized by the 3D coordinates of four control points: the three vertices and the circumcenter of a triangular target region. Nonlinear deformation on heart surfaces is handled by cubic spline interpolation based on radial pixel distances from the circumcenter. With a pre-computable design matrix, the model can be represented efficiently by a simple matrix equation. An iterative algorithm is developed based on the efficient second-order minimization to compute model parameters at each frame. The proposed tracking method is validated on the stereo-endoscopic videos of phantom heart and in vivo heart that are recorded by the da Vinci\\(^{\\tiny \\textregistered }\\) surgical system.","authors":["Bo Yang","Chao Liu","Keli Huang","Wenfeng Zheng"],"meta":["October 2017Signal Image and Video Processing 11(10)","DOI:10.1007/s11760-017-1090-y","Project: Research on stereo vision-based 3D motion tracking of dynamic in vivo soft-tissue surface"],"references":["308129582_Motion_Prediction_via_Online_Instantaneous_Frequency_Estimation_for_Vision-based_Beating_Heart_Tracking","291949828_Segmentation-based_compression_scheme_for_3D_animated_models","260330782_A_Quasi-Spherical_Triangle-Based_Approach_for_Efficient_3-D_Soft-Tissue_Motion_Tracking","224705476_Model-based_Motion_Estimation_of_Elastic_Surfaces_for_Minimally_Invasive_Cardiac_Surgery","294423383_Automatic_Localization_of_Endoscope_in_Intraoperative_CT_Image_A_Simple_Approach_to_Augmented_Reality_Guidance_in_Laparoscopic_Surgery","272011712_A_novel_stumpage_detection_method_for_forest_harvesting_based_on_multi-sensor_fusion","260760624_Deformation_invariant_bounding_spheres_for_dynamic_active_constraints_in_surgery","257731695_3D_Head_pose_estimation_and_camera_mouse_implementation_using_a_monocular_video_camera","224333244_Whisker-Like_Position_Sensor_for_Measuring_Physiological_Motion","224145399_Three-Dimensional_Tissue_Deformation_Recovery_and_Tracking","224072180_Heartbeat_synchronization_for_robotic_cardiac_surgery","221401145_Stereo-Based_Endoscopic_Tracking_of_Cardiac_Surface_Deformation","46818634_Real-Time_Stereo_Reconstruction_in_Robotically_Assisted_Minimally_Invasive_Surgery","220122765_Homography-based_2D_Visual_Tracking_and_Servoing","220122664_Three-dimensional_Motion_Tracking_for_Beating_Heart_Surgery_Using_a_Thin-plate_Spline_Deformable_Model"]}
