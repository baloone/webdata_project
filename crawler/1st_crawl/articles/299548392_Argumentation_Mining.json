{"id":"299548392_Argumentation_Mining","abstract":"Argumentation mining aims at automatically extracting structured arguments from unstructured textual documents. It has recently become a hot topic also due to its potential in processing information originating from the Web, and in particular from social media, in innovative ways. Recent advances in machine learning methods promise to enable breakthrough applications to social and economic sciences, policy making, and information technology: something that only a few years ago was unthinkable. In this survey article, we introduce argumentation models and methods, review existing systems and applications, and discuss challenges and perspectives of this exciting new research area.","authors":["Marco Lippi","Paolo Torroni"],"meta":["March 2016ACM Transactions on Internet Technology 16(2):1-25","DOI:10.1145/2850417"],"references":["301445937_Show_Me_Your_Evidence_-_an_Automatic_Method_for_Context_Dependent_Evidence_Detection","301409048_Back_up_your_Stance_Recognizing_Arguments_in_Online_Discussions","301409011_A_Benchmark_Dataset_for_Automatic_Detection_of_Claims_and_Evidence_in_the_Context_of_Controversial_Topics","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","307632447_Context_dependent_claim_detection","301445988_On_the_Role_of_Discourse_Markers_for_Discriminating_Claims_and_Premises_in_Argumentative_Discourse","301409117_Identifying_Appropriate_Support_for_Propositions_in_Online_User_Comments","301409114_Towards_Creation_of_a_Corpus_for_Argumentation_Mining_the_Biomedical_Genetics_Research_Literature","301404928_Towards_segment-based_recognition_of_argumentation_structure_in_short_texts","301404797_Mining_Arguments_From_19th_Century_Philosophical_Texts_Using_Topic_Based_Modelling"]}
