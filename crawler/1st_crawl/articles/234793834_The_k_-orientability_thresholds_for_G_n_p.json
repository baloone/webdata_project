{"id":"234793834_The_k_-orientability_thresholds_for_G_n_p","abstract":"We prove that, for k â‰¥ 2, the k-orientability threshold for the random graph Gn, p coincides with the threshold at which the (k + 1)-core has average degree 2k. The proof involves the analysis of a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find a k-orientation of the random graph. The k-orientation threshold has several applications including offline balanced allocation with a limit of k on maximum bin-size, perfect hashing with a limit of k on maximum chain-length, and concurrent access to parallel memories through redundancy,","authors":["Daniel Fernholz","Vijaya Ramachandran"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1283383.1283432"],"references":["2362512_Balanced_Allocations","1957298_Efficient_Hashing_with_Lookups_in_two_Memory_Accesses","262319902_A_Critical_Point_for_Random_Graphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","243134926_Sudden_Emergence_of_a_Giantk-Core_in_a_Random_Graph","228369557_The_random_graph_threshold_for_k-orientiability_and_a_fast_algorithm_for_optimal_multiple-choice_allocation","225453745_Balanced_Allocation_and_Dictionaries_with_Tightly_Packed_Constant_Size_Bins","220779252_The_pure_literal_rule_threshold_and_cores_in_random_hypergraphs","220345359_The_Cores_of_Random_Hypergraphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","220345220_Randomized_allocation_processes","4355284_Storing_a_Sparse_Table_with_01_Worst_Case_Access_Time","2121828_A_simple_solution_to_the_k-core_problem"]}
