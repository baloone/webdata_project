{"id":"228930761_Seismic_Imaging_of_the_Far_Hemisphere_of_the_Sun","abstract":"We apply phase-sensitive helioseismic holography to Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Dopper Imager data to demonstrate how acoustic travel-time perturbations may be mapped over the entire portion of the Sun facing away from the Earth, including the polar regions. In addition to offering significant improvements to ongoing space weather forecasting efforts, the procedure offers the possibility of local seismic monitoring of both the temporal and spatial variations in the acoustic properties of the Sun over all of the far surface.","authors":["Douglas Braun","Charles Lindsey"],"meta":["October 2001The Astrophysical Journal 560(2)","DOI:10.1086/324323"],"references":["238823041_Downflows_under_sunspots_detected_by_helioseismic_tomography","234540802_Local_acoustic_diagnostics_of_the_solar_interior","234379033_The_Solar_Oscillation_Investigation_-_Michelson_Doppler_Imager_SOI-MDI","234258498_Seismic_sounding_of_the_solar_core_Purging_the_corruption_from_the_Sun's_magnetic_activity","234246147_The_New_Era_in_Helioseismology","227203671_Local_Fractional_Frequency_Shifts_Used_as_Tracers_of_Magnetic_Activity","255905240_Polar_faculae_-_1906-1990","234480077_New_Developments_in_Local_Area_Helioseismology","234399257_Scattering_of_p-Modes_by_Sunspots_I_Observations","234215602_Scattering_of_p-Modes_by_Sunspots_II_Calculations_of_Phase_Shifts_from_a_Phenomenological_Model"]}
