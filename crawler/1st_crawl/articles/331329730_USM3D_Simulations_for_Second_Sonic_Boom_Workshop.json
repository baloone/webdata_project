{"id":"331329730_USM3D_Simulations_for_Second_Sonic_Boom_Workshop","abstract":"The NASA Tetrahedral Unstructured Software System with the USM3D flow solver was used to compute the test cases for the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop (SBPW2). The intent of this paper is to document the USM3D results for SBPW2 test cases. The test cases included an axisymmetric equivalent area body, a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency wingâ€“body, and a NASA low-boom supersonic configuration modeled with flow-through nacelles and engine boundary conditions. All simulations were conducted for a freestream Mach number of 1.6, 0 deg angle of attack, and a Reynolds number of 5.7 million per meter. Simulations were conducted on the tetrahedral grids provided by the workshop committee as well as a family of grids generated by an in-house approach for sonic-boom analyses known as BoomGrid using current best practices. The near-field pressure signatures were extracted and propagated to the ground with the atmospheric propagation code sBOOM. The USM3D near-field pressure signatures, corresponding sBOOM ground signatures, and loudness levels on the ground are compared with mean values from other workshop participants.","authors":["Alaa Elmiligui","Melissa B.
