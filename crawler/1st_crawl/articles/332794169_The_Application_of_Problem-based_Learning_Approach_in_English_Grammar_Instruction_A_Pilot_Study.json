{"id":"332794169_The_Application_of_Problem-based_Learning_Approach_in_English_Grammar_Instruction_A_Pilot_Study","abstract":"The study incorporates the problem-based approach (PBL) in the English class with an attempt to improve English low achieversâ€™ grammar competence pertaining to relative clauses and their motivation in learning English. Fifty students divided into seven teams with leader for each were recruited. This study adopts the pre- and post-test research design as well as classroom observation checklist and two assignments. The result indicates that the engagement level of the participants is increased by the scenario-based strategy and their grammar competence improves under PBL instruction after being compared with the scores of pretest and posttest, which suggests that the PBL approach really exerts a positive influence on the performance of the participant. The finding also implies that the participants emphasizes, when offering solutions to the scenario, more on employment than on studies, which may reflect their real life experiences.","authors":["Bella Chiou"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of Language Teaching and Research 10(3):446","DOI:10.17507/jltr.1003.06"],"references":["282182499_Problem-Based_Learning_in_ESL_Classroom_Students'_Perspectives","276181188_Teaching_English_Tenses_grammar_in_the_Turkish_Texts_A_Case_of_Simple_Present_Tense_Isil_Maketi_Iter","274176951_Teachers'_Beliefs_about_Classroom_Teaching_-_Teachers'_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Approaches","227792999_A_Problem-Based_Learning_Approach_to_Integrating_Foreign_Language_Into_Engineering","226800313_Shifting_to_a_Student-Centered_Science_Classroom_An_Exploration_of_Teacher_and_Student_Changes_in_Perceptions_and_Practices","317953568_Language_Power_and_Pedagogy_Bilingual_Children_in_the_Crossfire","292701591_An_overview_of_authentic_problem-based_learning","279663830_The_Application_of_the_Problem-Based_Learning_Approach_to_a_Second_Language_Learning_Context","271336774_Problem-Based_Learning_in_the_English_Language_Classroom","266644376_The_Integration_of_Critical_Thinking_Skills_into_College_Students","265989544_Problem-Based_Learning_A_possible_approach_to_language_education","249681440_Problem-Based_Learning_in_Social_Work_A_Study_of_Student_Learning_Outcomes","248917366_Radical_Constructivism_and_Its_Failings_Anti-Realism_and_Individualism","229503861_Problem-based_learning_in_medicine_and_beyond_A_brief_overview","49551734_Second_Language_Acquisition_Second_Language_Learning","43941704_The_Necessity_of_Grammar_Teaching"]}
