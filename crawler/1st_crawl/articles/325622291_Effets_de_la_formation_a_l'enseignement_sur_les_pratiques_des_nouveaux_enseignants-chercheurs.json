{"id":"325622291_Effets_de_la_formation_a_l'enseignement_sur_les_pratiques_des_nouveaux_enseignants-chercheurs","abstract":"Universities introduced teacher training to encourage new teacher-researchers to focus more closely on student learning processes. But does training really instigate this paradigm shift? Do the practices of trained teachers differ from their untrained counterparts? This paper presents data collected during interviews and observations with eight new teachers who received training and ifteen who did not. It appears that teachers, as a whole, exhibit practices that go beyond content transmission and that there is no difference between trained and untrained teachers.","authors":["Louise Ménard","Christian Hoffmann","Geneviève Lameul"],"meta":["April 2017Recherche & Formation 84(2):125-140","DOI:10.4000/rechercheformation.2771"],"references":["241683197_Trigwell_K_Caballero_K_Han_F_2012_Assessing_the_impact_of_a_university_teaching_development_program_Assessment_and_Evaluation_in_Higher_Education_37_499-511","238756046_Une_demarche_de_recherche_sur_la_pratique_enseignante_l'analyse_plurielle","228559299_What_the_Student_Does_teaching_for_enhanced_learning","225717143_A_follow-up_study_of_the_effect_of_pedagogical_training_on_teaching_in_higher_education","222426787_The_effect_of_pedagogical_training_on_teaching_in_higher_education","249797767_Telling_Half_the_Story_A_Critical_Review_of_Research_on_the_Teaching_Beliefs_and_Practices_of_University_Academics","249680810_The_Impact_of_Training_of_University_Teachers_on_Their_Teaching_Skills_Their_Approach_to_Teaching_and_the_Approach_to_Learning_of_Their_Students"]}
