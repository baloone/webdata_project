{"id":"268635310_Polytope_Des_Absorbants_Dans_Une_Classe_De_Graphe_a_Seuil","abstract":"A graph G is defined to be domishold (Benzaken and Hammer (1978)) if there exist real positive numbers associated to their vertices so that a set of vertices is dominating if and only if the sum of the corresponding weights exceeds a certain threshold b. In this paper, we characterize the polytope of the dominants in this class of graphs, using a polynomial algorithm to find a minimum weight dominating set.","authors":["Ali Ridha Mahjoub"],"meta":["December 1983North-Holland Mathematics Studies 17","DOI:10.1016/S0304-0208(08)73420-0"],"references":["268442507_Linear_Separation_of_Dominating_Sets_in_Graphs","264966343_Properties_of_Facets_of_Binary_Polytopes","239665414_On_certain_polytopes_associated_with_graphs","227204939_On_the_Facial_Structure_of_Set_Packing_Polyhedra","227150645_Further_facet_generating_procedures_for_vertex_packing_polytopes","227036534_Properties_of_Vertes_Packings_and_Independence_System_Polyhedra","226900103_Vertex_Packings_Structural_Properties_and_Algorithms","222984416_A_Class_of_Facet_Producing_Graphs_for_Vertex_Packing_Polyhedra","222809899_Polytope_des_independants_d'un_graphe_serie-parallele"]}
