{"id":"332002213_Review_of_harmony_search_with_respect_to_algorithm_structure","abstract":"Harmony Search (HS) is a metaheuristic optimisation algorithm inspired by musical improvisation. So far it has been applied to various optimisation problems, and there are several application-oriented review papers. However, this review paper tries to focus on the historical development of algorithm structure instead of applications. This paper explains the original HS algorithm along with a selection of modified and hybrid HS methods: adaption of original operators of the basic harmony search, parameter adaption, hybrid methods, handling multi-objective optimisation problems and constraint handling.","authors":["Tonghua Zhang","Zong Woo Geem"],"meta":["March 2019Swarm and Evolutionary Computation
