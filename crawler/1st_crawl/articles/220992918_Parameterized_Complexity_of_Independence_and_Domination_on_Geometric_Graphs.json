{"id":"220992918_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Independence_and_Domination_on_Geometric_Graphs","abstract":"We investigate the parameterized complexity of Maximum Independent Set and Dominating Set restricted to certain geometric graphs. We show that Dominating Set is W(1)-hard for the intersection graphs of unit squares, unit disks, and line segments. For Maximum Independent Set, we show that the problem is W(1)-complete for unit segments, but fixed-parameter tractable if the segments are axis-parallel.","authors":["Dániel Marx"],"meta":["September 2006","DOI:10.1007/11847250_14","SourceDBLP","Conference: Parameterized and Exact Computation, Second International Workshop, IWPEC 2006, Zürich, Switzerland, September 13-15, 2006, Proceedings"],"references":["220992873_Fixed_Parameter_Tractability_of_Independent_Set_in_Segment_Intersection_Graphs","220770525_Efficient_Approximation_Schemes_for_Geometric_Problems","220111228_A_Study_on_Two_Geometric_Location_Problems","2533046_Label_Placement_by_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Rectangles","2298848_Graph-Theoretical_Models_for_Frequency_Assignment_Problems"]}
