{"id":"242426966_A_Simplified_Abstract_Syntax_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"Previous definitions of the dataflow algebra have been identified as suffering from two practical problems, and this report discusses how both of these could be resolved. One problem is that the naming of the syntactic and semantic layers of detail of the algebra causes some confusion, and the reasons are described for renaming these as the event and computation layers respectively. The other problem is that the abstract syntax for what is now being called the event layer employed a number of sub-domains, reflecting the fact that it was concerned as much with defining the syntax of expressions in the algebra as it was with the underlying semantic domain. This report therefore presents a simplified version of the abstract syntax, which provides a more appropriate definition of the underlying semantic domain. It then shows how the fundamental axioms and theorems of the earlier version apply to the new abstract syntax, and in particular it corrects an error in the previous version of the formal semantics for the algebra, and hence shows the soundness and completeness of these axioms. The new version also gives a simpler presentation of the underlying algebra, while being fully consistent with the earlier version.","authors":["A. J.
