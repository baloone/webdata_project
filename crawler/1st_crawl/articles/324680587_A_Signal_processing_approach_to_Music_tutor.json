{"id":"324680587_A_Signal_processing_approach_to_Music_tutor","abstract":"Computer science plays a vital role providing us different kinds of software and the facility to learn singing accurately and smartly. This paper is to provide a singing tutor which will compare the learner song with the tutor song and provide the result of accuracy in the learner song. So any one sitting in his/her own room with a laptop or desktop computer can learn singing and judge the accuracy of the song. Firstly, to detect voiced and unvoiced part of the song, linear model is used here. Apply EMD (Empirical mode decomposition) to obtain IMFs. From the first IMF which captures most of the noise, estimate the noise level in the noisy signal and \"noise only\" model from the confidence interval parameter for the linear model and the corresponding model for a chosen confidence interval. Then compute the EMD of the noisy signal, and compute the IMF energies by using the confidence interval as a threshold. If there is at least one IMF whose energy exceeds the threshold then the speech frame is classified as voiced. If all the IMFs lie below the threshold then the speech frame is classified as unvoiced. Pitch is estimated from the voiced part only, so after separating the voiced part, weighted autocorrelation method is used here to estimate pitch and by using Hilbert transformation, energy is estimated. Then compare the pitch and energy of tutor song and student song to observe the difference and mistakes in the learner's song. By this way any one can identify the places in the song where he/she has mistaken, identify the scale and tune through which he/she can sing more accurately.","authors":["Md.
