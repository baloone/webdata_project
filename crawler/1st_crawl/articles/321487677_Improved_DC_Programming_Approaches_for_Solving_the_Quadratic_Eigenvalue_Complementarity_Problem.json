{"id":"321487677_Improved_DC_Programming_Approaches_for_Solving_the_Quadratic_Eigenvalue_Complementarity_Problem","abstract":"We consider to reformulate the quadratic eigenvalue complementarity problem (QEiCP) as difference of convex (DC) programming problem. The QEiCP is in fact equivalent to a nonconvex polynomial optimization problem which is indeed a dc programming problem. We will investigate different dc reformulations for QEiCP, and introduce respectively their dc algorithms. A notion of local DC decomposition is introduced which aims at constructing a better dc decomposition regarding to the specific feature of certain neighborhood at iterative points obtained by dc algorithm. Experimental results show good performance of our methods.","authors":["Yi-Shuai Niu","Joaquim J.
