{"id":"260800833_Noise_Facilitation_in_Associative_Memories_of_Exponential_Capacity","abstract":"Recent advances in associative memory design through structured pattern sets\nand graph-based inference algorithms have allowed reliable learning and recall\nof an exponential number of patterns. Although these designs correct external\nerrors in recall, they assume neurons that compute noiselessly, in contrast to\nthe highly variable neurons in brain regions thought to operate associatively\nsuch as hippocampus and olfactory cortex.\nHere we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and\nanalytically characterize performance. As long as the internal noise level is\nbelow a specified threshold, the error probability in the recall phase can be\nmade exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show that internal noise actually\nimproves the performance of the recall phase while the pattern retrieval\ncapacity remains intact, i.e., the number of stored patterns does not reduce\nwith noise (up to a threshold). Computational experiments lend additional\nsupport to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional benefit to\nnoisy neurons in biological neuronal networks.","authors":["Amin Karbasi","Amir Hesam Salavati","Amin Shokrollahi","Lav R.
