{"id":"334668069_DRIMPAC-Unified_Demand_Response_Interoperability_Framework_Enabling_Market_Participation_of_Active_Energy_Consumers","abstract":"Residential and tertiary buildings are responsible for 44% of final energy consumption in Europe. However, they are currently not engaged in Demand Response (DR) activities due to technology-related and consumer-related roadblocks. One of the main technological roadblocks is the extreme fragmentation of protocols, data models and standards for Building Energy Management (BEM) systems and Building to Grid (B2G) communications. DRIMPAC is an EU-funded Innovation Action that aims to address the interoperability gaps and standards fragmentation in the residential and commercial buildings Demand Response domain aiming to reduce costs for all involved actors and make DR more attractive for the end prosumer.","authors":["Tzovaras","Yannis Damousis","Antonis Papanikolaou","Pitsiladis"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.3390/proceedings2019020015"],"references":[]}
