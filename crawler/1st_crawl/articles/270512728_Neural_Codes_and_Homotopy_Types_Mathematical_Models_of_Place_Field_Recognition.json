{"id":"270512728_Neural_Codes_and_Homotopy_Types_Mathematical_Models_of_Place_Field_Recognition","abstract":"This note is a brief survey of some results of the recent collaboration of\nneurobiologists and mathematicians dedicated to stimulus reconstruction from\nneuronal spiking activity. This collaboration, in particular, led to the\nconsideration of binary codes used by brain for encoding a stimuli domain such\nas a rodent's territory through the combinatorics of its covering by local\nneighborhoods.\nThe survey is addressed to mathematicians (cf. [DeSch01]) and focuses on the\nidea that stimuli spaces are represented by the relevant neural codes as\nsimplicial sets and thus encode say, the homotopy type of space if local\nneighborhoods are convex (see [CuIt08], [CuItVCYo13], [Yo14], [SiGh07]).}","authors":["Yuri I.
