{"id":"326162791_Litigation_claims_in_relation_to_radiology_what_can_we_learn","abstract":"Aim: \nTo analyse data provided by the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) to establish common and/or reoccurring themes or trends, and use these established learning points to reduce the possibility of such claims in the future.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nData provided by the NHSLA under the Freedom of Information Act for settled claims against radiology between 1995 and 2014 were analysed for common themes.\n\nResults: \nSeven hundred and ninety-one settled claims were recorded by the NHSLA between 1995 and 2014 where radiology was implicated as the primary specialty at fault. Alleged missed or delayed diagnosis of a tumour accounted for almost a third of claims. Eight percent of claims related to interventional radiology. Almost 10% of claims (n=75) were settled due to an injury whilst in the radiology department, with almost a third of these due to a fall in the department.\n\nConclusion: \n\"To err is human\", but by analysing NHSLA claims related to radiology, thematic analysis and discussion regarding these cases can be highlighted, and hopefully, to mitigate these risks and thus reduce liability in the future.","authors":["Oliver Samuel Hulson"],"meta":["July 2018Clinical Radiology 73(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.crad.2018.05.025"],"references":["317153113_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Imaging_General_Overview","313852627_Distraction_in_diagnostic_radiology_How_is_search_through_volumetric_medical_images_affected_by_interruptions","311500275_Error_and_discrepancy_in_radiology_inevitable_or_avoidable","301330399_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_with_Deep_Learning_Architecture_Applications_to_Breast_Lesions_in_US_Images_and_Pulmonary_Nodules_in_CT_Scans","279631383_Risk_management_in_radiology_departments","268154284_CT_Colonography_with_Computer-aided_Detection_Recognizing_the_Causes_of_False-Positive_Reader_Results-Erratum","266623906_Structured_Reporting_of_Multiphasic_CT_for_Pancreatic_Cancer_Potential_Effect_on_Staging_and_Surgical_Planning","260432422_Deep_Learning-Based_Feature_Representation_for_ADMCI_Classification","256098214_Cognitive_and_System_Factors_Contributing_to_Diagnostic_Errors_in_Radiology","236925488_Malpractice_in_Radiology_What_Should_You_Worry_About","51854506_The_Insidious_Problem_of_Fatigue_in_Medical_Imaging_Practice","49768412_Checklists_to_Reduce_Diagnostic_Errors","26242024_Medico-legal_claims_against_English_radiologists_1995-2006","6413274_Influence_of_Computer-Aided_Detection_on_Performance_of_Screening_Mammography","5892389_Malpractice_stress_syndrome_in_radiologists_and_radiotherapists_Perceived_causes_and_consequences","321047904_Deep_Learning_A_Primer_for_Radiologists","310752446_Education_and_debate_Human_error_Models_and_management","270934003_Ninth_Annual_Report_and_Accounts","266578148_Do_Telephone_Call_Interruptions_Have_an_ImPact_on_Radiology_Resident_Diagnostic_Accuracy","265337865_Communicate_All_Actionable_Findings_Now_Not_Later","260023091_Actionable_Findings_and_the_Role_of_IT_Support_Report_of_the_ACR_Actionable_Reporting_Work_Group","232175736_Interpretation_of_Abdominal_CT_Analysis_of_Errors_and_Their_Causes","51075730_Improving_Communication_of_Diagnostic_Radiology_Findings_through_Structured_Reporting","46147994_Long_Radiology_Workdays_Reduce_Detection_and_Accommodation_Accuracy","46107599_Computer-aided_Detection_of_Lung_Cancer_on_Chest_Radiographs_Effect_on_Observer_Performance","19819035_Lung_lesions_Correlation_between_viewing_time_and_detection","19531130_Reduction_of_Asthenopia_after_Accommodative_Facility_Training","12174275_Coping_with_a_medical_malpractice_suit","11562727_Error_in_Radiology","7886681_Computer_Vision_Syndrome_A_Review"]}
