{"id":"297323003_A_practical_anonymous_payment_scheme_for_electronic_commerce","abstract":"We propose a practical anonymous payment scheme with anonymous accounts. By means of our proposed scheme, the size of a bank's database is dramatically reduced. Also, the issue of e-coins for an anonymous account is controlled by several issuers, who represent a bank and who can be chosen by the customer or assigned by the system, on the current available issuers list according to the internet conditions. Our scheme does not require the assistance of a mutually entrusted third party.","authors":["WS Juang"],"meta":["December 2003Computers & Mathematics with Applications 46(12):1787-1798","DOI:10.1016/S0898-1221(03)00404-8"],"references":["2954826_The_state_of_the_art_in_electronic_payment_systems","266697700_Security_protocols_International_workshop_Cambridge_GB_April_10-12_1996_Proceedings","238800431_A_practical_anonymous_multi-authority_e-cash_scheme","234779864_Digital_multisignature_scheme_using_Bijective_public-key_Cryptosystems","222495830_A_collision-free_secret_ballot_protocol_for_computerized_general_elections","220420984_Untraceable_Electronic_Mail_Return_Addresses_and_Digital_Pseudonyms","220213042_Anonymous_channel_and_authentication_in_wireless_communications","3082998_Hellman_M_An_improved_algorithm_for_computing_logarithms_over_GFp_and_its_cryptographic_significance_IEEE_Trans_Inform_Theory_IT_24_106-110","2332792_Partially_Blind_Threshold_Signatures_Based_on_Discrete_Logarithm"]}
