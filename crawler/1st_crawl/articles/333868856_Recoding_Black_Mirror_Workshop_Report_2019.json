{"id":"333868856_Recoding_Black_Mirror_Workshop_Report_2019","abstract":"The intriguingly named ‘Re-Coding Black Mirror’ was a one day workshop at the CPDP Conference (Computers, Privacy & Data Protection) which had three main themes of addressing the Ethical and Societal challenges of digital technologies, considering Computer Science solutions against the misuse of technologies, and Technological approaches to prevent Black Mirror’s dystopian future. The programme was made up of several sessions of presentations, followed by a group activity to design your own dystopian episode of Black Mirror. These events were all run consecutively so it was possible to attend each talk and take part in the group activities.","authors":["Samantha Kanza"],"meta":["February 2019"],"references":[]}
