{"id":"313125603_ba_Connectivity_Index_of_Graphs","abstract":"Let $E_\\beta(G)$ be the set of paths of length $\\beta$ in a graph $G$. For an integer $\\beta\\geq1$ and a real number $\\alpha$, the $(\\beta, \\alpha)$-connectivity index is defined as\n$$^\\beta\\chi_\\alpha(G)=\\sum \\limits_{v_1v_2 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot v_{\\beta+1}\\in E_\\beta(G)}(d_{G}(v_1)d_{G}(v_2)...d_{G}(v_{\\beta+1}))^\\alpha$$. The $(2, 1)$-connectivity index shows good correlation with acentric factor of an octane isomers. In this paper, we compute the $(2, \\alpha)$-connectivity index of certain class of graphs, present the upper and lower bounds for $(2, \\alpha)$-connectivity index in terms of number of vertices, number of edges and minimum vertex degree and determine the extremal graphs which achieve the bounds. Further, we compute the $(2, \\alpha)$-connectivity index of line graphs of subdivision graphs of 2D-lattice, nanotube and nanotorus of $TUC_{4}C_{8}[p, q]$, tadpole graphs, wheel graphs and ladder graphs.","authors":["B.
