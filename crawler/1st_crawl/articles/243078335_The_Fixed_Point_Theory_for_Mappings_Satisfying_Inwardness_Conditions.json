{"id":"243078335_The_Fixed_Point_Theory_for_Mappings_Satisfying_Inwardness_Conditions","abstract":"Let X be a normed linear space and let K be a convex subset of X. The inward set, /^(jc), of x relative to K is defined as follows: I^ix) = (* + c(u - x):c > 1, u G £. A mapping T:K —* X is said to be inward if Tx E I^(x) for each x E K, and weakly inward if Tx belongs to the closure of for each x e K. In this paper a characterization of weakly inward mappings is given in terms of a condition arising in the study of ordinary differential equations. A general fixed point theorem is proved and applied to derive a generalization of the Contraction Mapping Principle in a complete metric space, and then applied together with the characterization of weakly inward mappings to obtain some fixed point theorems in Banach spaces.","authors":["James Caristi"],"meta":["January 1976Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 215(JAN):241-241","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9947-1976-0394329-4"],"references":["243781915_A_Fixed_Point_Theorem_for_Mappings_which_do_not_Increase_Distances","239285207_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Nonexpansive_Mappings_Satisfying_Certain_Boundary_Conditions","274169983_A_Fixed-Point_Theorem_for_Inward_and_Outward_Maps","268493226_The_Theorems_of_Bony_and_Brezis_on_Flow-Invariant_Sets","266050814_Remarks_on_fixed_points_II","258234753_Nonlinear_Semigroups_and_Evolution_Equations","254197806_Semicontractive_and_semiaccretive_nonlinear_mappings_in_Banach_spaces","248745073_Fixed_points_of_condensing_functions","246971035_Nonlinear_mappings_of_nonexpansive_and_accretive_type_in_Banach_spaces","246200644_Fixed-point_theorems_for_multivalued_noncompact_inward_maps","243087706_Fixed_Points_of_Non-Expansive_Functions","243077643_Differential_Equations_on_Closed_Subsets_of_a_Banach_Space","243056786_A_Generalization_of_Peano's_Existence_Theorem_and_Flow_Invariance","229578422_On_a_characterization_of_flow-invariant_sets","226232383_Fixed_points_in_locally_covex_spaces","226134925_Fixed_point_theorems_for_set-valued_maps_in_infinit_dimensional_spaces","225863684_The_fixed_point_theory_of_multi-valued_mapping_in_topological_spaces","225251088_Extensions_of_two_fixed_point_theorems_of_F_E_Browder","220543827_Differential_Inequalities_and_Non-Lipschitz_Scalar_Functions","35500218_Fixed_point_theorems_for_outward_maps_microform"]}
