{"id":"51433425_Factors_Essential_for_Successful_All-Ceramic_Restorations","abstract":"The use of all-ceramic crowns is increasing, and this trend will continue. However, all-ceramic systems are not all the same. They differ considerably in their relative esthetic potential, their physical properties and evidence base relative to longevity. The use of an all-ceramic system does not guarantee outstanding esthetics.\nSome all-ceramic systems can provide superior esthetic results compared with metal-ceramic restorations. Zirconia-cored crowns are the strongest all-ceramic system and may provide improved esthetic results compared with metal-ceramic crowns. No all-ceramic restoration has been shown to have a life span equivalent to that of metal-ceramic restorations. Further clinical trials are needed.\nClinicians should choose appropriate all-ceramic restorations on the basis of their patients' needs. Currently available evidence indicates that clinicians should not use all-ceramic crowns on molars; in addition, posterior fixed partial prostheses fabricated with all-ceramic materials have a high likelihood of failure.","authors":["Terence Edward Donovan"],"meta":["September 2008Journal of the American Dental Association (1939) 139 Suppl(Suppl):14S-18S","DOI:10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0360","SourcePubMed"],"references":["22861765_The_Biologic_Width_-_A_Concept_in_Periodontics_and_Restorative_Dentistry","229965040_Altering_Gingival_Levels_The_Restorative_Connection_Part_I_Biologic_Variables","227546546_Immediate_Dentin_Sealing_A_Fundamental_Procedure_for_Indirect_Bonded_Restorations","51334718_All-ceramic_crown_systems_clinical_research_versus_observation_in_supporting_claims","51296861_The_Dual_Bonding_Technique_A_Modified_Method_to_Improve_Adhesive_Luting_Procedures","21459699_Tooth_preparation_for_indirect_esthetic_restoration","21121539_Gingival_enhancement_in_fixed_prosthodontics_Part_I_Clinical_Findings","21098484_Gingival_enhancement_in_fixed_prosthodontics_Part_II_Microbiologic_findings","21088916_Gingival_enhancement_in_fixed_prosthodontics_Part_III_Anamnestic_findings","19904184_Considerations_in_posterior_glass-ceramic_restorations","19861513_Restorative_margins_and_periodontal_health_A_new_look_at_an_old_perspective","16449092_The_stressed_pulp_condition_An_endodontic-restorative_diagnostic_concept","14112844_Assessment_of_the_periapical_and_clinical_status_of_crowned_teeth_over_25_years","13574959_Soft_tissue_management_with_metal-ceramic_and_all-ceramic_restorations","12919530_Diagnostic_provisional_restorations_in_restorative_dentistry_The_blueprint_for_success","12456177_The_Effect_of_Grinding_and_Sandblasting_on_Flexural_Strength_and_Reliability_of_Y-TZP_Zirconia_Ceramic","11796835_Predictable_aesthetics_with_metal-ceramic_and_all-ceramic_crowns_The_critical_importance_of_soft-tissue_management","10818300_Survival_of_glass-ceramic_materials_and_involved_clinical_risk_variables_affecting_long-term_survival","8533430_Cervical_margin_design_with_contemporary_esthetic_restorations","7695930_Near-surface_damage_-_A_persistent_problem_in_crowns_obtained_by_computer-aided_design_and_manufacturing","7451833_Immediate_dentin_sealing_improves_bond_strength_of_indirect_restorations","6599764_Contact_damage_in_an_yttria_stabilized_zirconia_Implications","6180351_State_of_The_Art_of_Zirconia_for_Dental_Applications","6143464_Five-year_clinical_results_of_zirconia_frameworks_for_posterior_fixed_partial_dentures","5471510_Resin_bonding_to_ceramic"]}
