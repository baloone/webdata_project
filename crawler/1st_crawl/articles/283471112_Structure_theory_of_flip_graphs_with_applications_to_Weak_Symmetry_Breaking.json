{"id":"283471112_Structure_theory_of_flip_graphs_with_applications_to_Weak_Symmetry_Breaking","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a class of graphs which we call flip graphs. These\ngraphs encode adjacency structure in certain subcomplexes of iterated standard\nchromatic subdivisions of a simplex. While keeping the geometric background in\nmind we develop the structure theory of matchings in flip graphs in a purely\ncombinatorial way. The main applications of our theory lie in the field of\ntheoretical distributed computing, as we use our combinatorial results to prove\nnew estimates on the symmetry breaking number, introduced in arXiv:1506.03944\n[cs.DC].\nSpecifically, we are able to make significant progress in understanding the\ncomplexity of the so-called Weak Symmetry Breaking task. We prove several\nresults concerning this complexity, with the rather unexpected main theorem\nstating that there exists infinitely many values of $n$, for which the Weak\nSymmetry Breaking is solvable in $3$ rounds. In particular, the minimal number\nof rounds which a distributed protocol needs to solve the Weak Symmetry\nBreaking task does not go to infinity when the number of processes goes to\ninfinity.\nAs a consequence of our result, we suggest to change the paradigm. We think,\nthat the bounds on the complexity of solving WSB for $n$ processes should be\nformulated in terms of the size of the solutions of the associated Diophantine\nequation, rather the value $n$ itself.","authors":["Dmitry N.
