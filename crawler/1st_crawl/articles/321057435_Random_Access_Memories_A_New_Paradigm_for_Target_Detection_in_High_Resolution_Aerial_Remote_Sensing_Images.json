{"id":"321057435_Random_Access_Memories_A_New_Paradigm_for_Target_Detection_in_High_Resolution_Aerial_Remote_Sensing_Images","abstract":"We propose a new paradigm for target detection in high resolution aerial remote sensing images under small target priors. Previous remote sensing target detection methods frame the detection as learning of detection model + inference of class-label and bounding-box coordinates. Instead, we formulate it from a Bayesian view that at inference stage, the detection model is adaptively updated to maximize its posterior that is determined by both training and observation. We call this paradigm “Random Access Memories (RAM)”. In this paradigm, “Memories” can be interpreted as any model distribution learned from training data and “Random Access” means accessing memories and randomly adjusting the model at detection phase to obtain better adaptivity to any unseen distribution of test data. By leveraging some latest detection techniques e.g. deep Convolutional Neural Networks and multi-scale anchors, experimental results on a public remote sensing target detection dataset show our method outperforms several other state of the art methods. We also introduce a new dataset “LEVIR”, which is one order of magnitude larger than other datasets of this field. LEVIR consists of a large set of Google Earth images, with over 22k images and 10k independently labeled targets. RAM gives noticeable upgrade of accuracy (an mean average precision improvement of 1%~4%) of our baseline detectors with acceptable computational overhead.","authors":["Zhengxia Zou","Zhenwei Shi"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2773199"],"references":["316950618_Maritime_Semantic_Labeling_of_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images_with_Multi-Scale_Fully_Convolutional_Network","311713289_Hyperspectral_image_processing_for_automatic_target_detection_applications","308278279_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","305638531_A_Unified_Multi-scale_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Fast_Object_Detection","301879841_HyperNet_Towards_Accurate_Region_Proposal_Generation_and_Joint_Object_Detection","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","261306330_Pedestrian_detection_at_100_frames_per_second","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","320387425_The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","315932769_Can_a_Machine_Generate_Humanlike_Language_Descriptions_for_a_Remote_Sensing_Image","311611062_Inside-Outside_Net_Detecting_Objects_in_Context_with_Skip_Pooling_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","311610792_LocNet_Improving_Localization_Accuracy_for_Object_Detection","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","311609212_HyperNet_Towards_Accurate_Region_Proposal_Generation_and_Joint_Object_Detection","311609097_Training_Region-Based_Object_Detectors_with_Online_Hard_Example_Mining","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311573567_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Object_Detection","308277265_A_Unified_Multi-scale_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Fast_Object_Detection","307870837_Learning_Rotation-Invariant_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection_in_VHR_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images","304417592_MatConvNet_convolutional_neural_networks_for_MATLAB","304031097_Ship_Detection_in_Spaceborne_Optical_Image_With_SVD_Networks","303847364_Deep_Learning_for_Remote_Sensing_Data_A_Technical_Tutorial_on_the_State_of_the_Art","303836055_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_Based_on_Coupled_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Aircraft_Detection","303269133_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning","299570598_A_Survey_on_Object_Detection_in_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images","287250848_Inside-Outside_Net_Detecting_Objects_in_Context_with_Skip_Pooling_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284788316_LocNet_Improving_Localization_Accuracy_for_Object_Detection","282490148_Vehicle_detection_in_remote_sensing_imagery_based_on_salient_information_and_local_shape_feature","281606455_A_Hierarchical_Oil_Tank_Detector_With_Deep_Surrounding_Features_for_High-Resolution_Optical_Satellite_Imagery","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","280940018_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning","279309903_AttentionNet_Aggregating_Weak_Directions_for_Accurate_Object_Detection","278049038_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","275669302_Fast_r-cnn","272391173_Object_Detection_in_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images_Based_on_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_and_High-Level_Feature_Learning","269636298_MatConvNet_-_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_MATLAB","268690576_Multi-class_geospatial_object_detection_and_geographic_image_classification_based_on_collection_of_part_detectors","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","264579180_Fast_Feature_Pyramids_for_Object_Detection","264499036_Airplane_detection_based_on_rotation_invariant_and_sparse_coding_in_remote_sensing_images","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","260992198_Ship_Detection_in_High-Resolution_Optical_Imagery_Based_on_Anomaly_Detector_and_Local_Shape_Feature","260016769_Efficient_simultaneous_detection_of_multi-class_geospatial_targets_based_on_visual_saliency_modeling_and_discriminative_learning_of_sparse_coding","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","247878890_The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics_3_Quantum_Mechanics","240224936_Rapid_object_detection_using_a_boosted_cascade_of_simple_features","235890128_Machine_Learning_A_Probabilistic_Perspective","224138709_Overhead_imagery_research_data_set_-_An_annotated_data_library_tools_to_aid_in_the_development_of_computer_vision_algorithms"]}
