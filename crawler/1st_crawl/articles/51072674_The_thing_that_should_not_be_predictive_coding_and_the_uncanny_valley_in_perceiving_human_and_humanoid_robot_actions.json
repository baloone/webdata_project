{"id":"51072674_The_thing_that_should_not_be_predictive_coding_and_the_uncanny_valley_in_perceiving_human_and_humanoid_robot_actions","abstract":"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) repetition suppression, we explored the selectivity of the human action\nperception system (APS), which consists of temporal, parietal and frontal areas, for the appearance and/or motion of the perceived\nagent. Participants watched body movements of a human (biological appearance and movement), a robot (mechanical appearance\nand movement) or an android (biological appearance, mechanical movement). With the exception of extrastriate body area, which\nshowed more suppression for human like appearance, the APS was not selective for appearance or motion per se. Instead, distinctive responses were found to the mismatch between appearance and motion: whereas suppression effects for\nthe human and robot were similar to each other, they were stronger for the android, notably in bilateral anterior intraparietal\nsulcus, a key node in the APS. These results could reflect increased prediction error as the brain negotiates an agent that\nappears human, but does not move biologically, and help explain the ‘uncanny valley’ phenomenon.","authors":["Ayse Pinar Saygin","Thierry Chaminade","Hiroshi Ishiguro","Jon Driver"],"meta":["April 2011Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience 7(4):413-22","DOI:10.1093/scan/nsr025","SourcePubMed"],"references":["304541561_Internal_models_for_motor_control_and_trajectory_planning","263335286_What_Is_a_Human_Toward_Psychological_Benchmarks_in_the_Field_of_Human-Robot_Interaction","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","292127187_Perceptual-cognitive_universals_as_reflections_of_the_world","286109221_Neural_Mechanisms_of_Selective_Visual_Attention","285111771_Das_Unheimliche_The_Uncanny","281477186_Why_Tom_Hanks_is_less_than_human_While_sensors_cannot_capture_how_humans_act_humans_can_give_life_to_digital_characters","272087835_The_Uncanny_Valley","269407900_The_Cological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","259253284_The_ecological_approach_to_visual_perception"]}
