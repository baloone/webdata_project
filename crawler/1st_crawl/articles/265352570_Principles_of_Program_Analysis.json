{"id":"265352570_Principles_of_Program_Analysis","abstract":"In this book we shall introduce four of the main approaches to program analysis: Data Flow Analysis, Control Flow Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, and Type and Effect Systems. Each of Chapters 2 to 5 deals with one of these approaches to some length and generally treats the more advanced material in later sections. Throughout the book we aim at stressing the many similarities between what may at a first glance appear to be very unrelated approaches. To help getting this idea across, and to serve as a gentle introduction, this chapter treats all of-the approaches at the level of examples. The technical details are worked-out but it may be difficult to apply the techniques to related examples until some of the material of later chapters have been studied.","authors":["Flemming Nielson","Hanne Riis Nielson","Chris Hankin"],"meta":["January 1999","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-3-642-08474-4"],"references":["222488307_Flow_Logic_and_Operational_Semantics","221302890_Compile-Time_Analysis_of_Object-Oriented_Programs","220997735_Solving_Shape-Analysis_Problems_in_Languages_with_Destructive_Updating","340721078_Precise_Interprocedural_Dataflow_Analysis_with_Applications_to_Constant_Propagation","257285824_A_Syntactic_Approach_to_Type_Soundness","238676555_Implementing_the_call-by-value_lambda-calculus_using_a_stack_of_regions","222502168_Region-Based_Memory_Management","222481413_Principal_type_schemes_for_functional_programs_with_overloading_and_subtyping","222295108_A_lattice_for_abstract_interpretation_of_dynamic_LISP-like_structures","220997031_Monoids_for_Rapid_Data_Flow_Analysis","220917122_Polymorphic_Type_Inference_with_Overloading_and_Subtyping","220758683_The_Typed_lambda-Calculus_with_First-Class_Processes","220673246_Operational_Semantics_of_Termination_Types","220404621_A_Region_Inference_Algorithm","220246669_Type_Inference_for_Polymorphic_References"]}
