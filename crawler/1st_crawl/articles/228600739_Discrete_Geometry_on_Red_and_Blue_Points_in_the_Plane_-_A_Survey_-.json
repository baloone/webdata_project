{"id":"228600739_Discrete_Geometry_on_Red_and_Blue_Points_in_the_Plane_-_A_Survey_-","abstract":"In this paper, we give a short survey on discrete geometry on red and blue points in the plane, most of whose results were obtained in the past decade. We consider balanced subdivision problems, geometric graph problems, graph embedding problems, Gallai-type problems and others.","authors":["Atsushi Kaneko","M Kano"],"meta":["February 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-55566-4_25"],"references":["228847570_Path_coverings_of_two_sets_of_points_in_the_plane","220190433_On_a_straight-line_embedding_problem_of_graphs","346444513_Geometric_Graph_Theory","316823755_Problem-Solving_Through_Problems","316520040_Layout_of_rooted_trees","285898545_Solution_to_problem_4065","268963695_On_the_mathematical_question_What_is_a_tree","267064158_Problem-solving_Through_Problems","266958504_Proofs_from_THE_BOOK_Transl_from_the_English_by_Nicolas_Puech_3rd_ed","263867742_ALTERNATING_HAMILTON_CYCLES_WITH_MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_CROSSINGS_IN_THE_PLANE","248172016_Two_Dimensional_Ham-Sandwich_Theorem_for_Partitioning_into_Three_Convex_Pieces","247688313_Sylvester's_Problem_on_Collinear_Points_and_a_Relative","227274547_Simultaneous_partitions_of_measures_by_K_-fans","227079768_Straight-Line_Embeddings_of_Two_Rooted_Trees_in_the_Plane","226835376_Generalizing_Ham_Sandwich_Cuts_to_Equitable_Subdivisions","226662170_On_the_Number_of_Balanced_Lines","226662056_Equipartition_of_Two_Measures_by_a_4-Fan","225834432_Algorithms_for_ham-sandwich_cuts","225432830_There_exist_6n13_ordinary_points","221584407_Generalized_Balanced_Partitions_of_Two_Sets_of_Points_in_the_Plane","221584365_2-Dimension_Ham_Sandwich_Theorem_for_Partitioning_into_Three_Convex_Pieces","221557261_Bipartite_Embeddings_of_Trees_in_the_Plane","220991175_Straight-line_embeddings_of_three_rooted_trees_in_the_plane","220991137_A_balanced_partition_of_points_in_the_plane_and_tree_embedding_problems","220569305_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220568498_Straight_line_embeddings_of_rooted_star_forests_in_the_plane","220556247_Balanced_partitions_of_two_sets_of_points_in_the_plane","220452905_The_Rooted_Tree_Embedding_Problem_into_Points_in_the_Plane","220442375_How_to_draw_a_planar_graph_on_a_grid","220397665_Balanced_Convex_Partitions_of_Measures_in_R","220189022_A_note_on_balanced_colourings_for_lattice_points","220188993_Simple_alternating_path_problem","220113518_Intersection_Number_of_Two_Connected_Geometric_Graphs","48352491_Mathematical_question_spaces","44564871_Proofs_from_the_book_Martin_Aigner_Gunter_M_Ziegler","44547400_Problem-solving_through_problems_Loren_C_Larson","37465025_Geometric_graph_theory","37465003_Combinatorial_Geometry","37464908_Partitioning_Colored_Point_Sets_into_Monochromatic_Parts","37464892_Bichromatic_Lines_with_Few_Points","37428345_Isolating_points_by_lines_in_the_plane","2882556_Separating_Objects_in_the_Plane_By_Wedges_and_Strips","2402589_Complete_Combinatorial_Generation_of_Small_Point_Configurations_and_Hyperplane_Arrangements","2389150_Matching_Colored_Points_in_the_Plane_Some_New_Results"]}
