{"id":"332493627_Deep_learning_-_method_overview_and_review_of_use_for_fruit_detection_and_yield_estimation_httpsauthorselseviercoma1YvMhcFCSJKOi","abstract":"A review of developments in the rapidly developing field of deep learning is presented. Recommendations are\nmade for original contributions to the literature, as opposed to formulaic applications of established methods to\nnew application areas (e.g., to new crops), including the use of standard metrics (e.g., F1 score, the harmonic\nmean between Precision and Recall) for model comparison involving binary classification. A recommendation\nfor the provision and use of publically available fruit-in-orchard image sets is made, to allow method comparisons and for implementation of transfer learning for deep learning models trained on the large public generic\ndatasets. Emphasis is placed on practical aspects for application of deep learning models for the task of fruit\ndetection and localisation, in support of tree crop load estimation. Approaches to the extrapolation of tree image\ncounts to orchard yield estimation are also reviewed, dealing with the issue of occluded fruit in imaging. The\nreview is intended to assist new users of deep learning image processing techniques, and to influence the direction of the coming body of application work on fruit detection.","authors":["Anand Koirala"],"meta":["April 2019Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 162","DOI:10.1016/j.compag.2019.04.017","Project: Deep learning for yield estimation"],"references":["336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","331423658_Deep_learning_for_real-time_fruit_detection_and_orchard_fruit_load_estimation_benchmarking_of_'MangoYOLO'","329137541_Exploring_the_Potential_of_High_Resolution_WorldView-3_Imagery_for_Estimating_Yield_of_Mango","327029380_Machine_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Review","324166682_Robust_Fruit_Counting_Combining_Deep_Learning_Tracking_and_Structure_from_Motion","323357827_Deep_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Survey","321475443_Fruit_recognition_from_images_using_deep_learning","321354490_On-Tree_Mango_Fruit_Size_Estimation_Using_RGB-D_Images","318486455_Machine_Vision_based_Fruit_Classification_and_Grading_-_A_Review","316945117_Deep_Count_Fruit_Counting_Based_on_Deep_Simulated_Learning","312564003_Early_Yield_Prediction_Using_Image_Analysis_of_Apple_Fruit_and_Tree_Canopy_Features_with_Neural_Networks","312298640_Counting_Apples_and_Oranges_With_Deep_Learning_A_Data-Driven_Approach","310428211_Image_Based_Mango_Fruit_Detection_Localisation_and_Yield_Estimation_Using_Multiple_View_Geometry","308278279_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","305824563_DeepFruits_A_Fruit_Detection_System_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","303916916_Detecting_tomatoes_in_greenhouse_scenes_by_combining_AdaBoost_classifier_and_colour_analysis","286862872_Automatic_Mango_Detection_Using_Texture_Analysis_and_Randomised_Hough_Transform","329740202_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","329246944_General_improved_SSD_model_for_picking_object_recognition_of_multiple_fruits_in_natural_environment","328171647_MangoNet_A_deep_semantic_segmentation_architecture_for_a_method_to_detect_and_count_mangoes_in_an_open_orchard","326809929_A_Real-Time_Detection_Framework_for_On-Tree_Mango_Based_on_SSD_Network_11th_International_Conference_ICIRA_2018_Newcastle_NSW_Australia_August_9-11_2018_Proceedings_Part_II","326698881_Rapid_detection_of_fruits_in_orchard_scene_based_on_deep_neural_network","326172780_Visual_Detection_Technology_of_Green_Citrus_under_Natural_Environment","324387691_YOLOv3_An_Incremental_Improvement","323865210_Detecting_greenhouse_strawberries_mature_and_immature_using_deep_convolutional_neural_network","322276795_Surf_Speeded_up_robust_features","322060396_Mask_R-CNN","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","322058942_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","320968382_Xception_Deep_Learning_with_Depthwise_Separable_Convolutions","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","319844808_A_Feature_Learning_Based_Approach_for_Automated_Fruit_Yield_Estimation","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","318692655_Deep_fruit_detection_in_orchards","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309460471_Image_Segmentation_for_Fruit_Detection_and_Yield_Estimation_in_Apple_Orchards","308980507_Crafting_GBD-Net_for_Object_Detection","308835300_Estimating_crop_yields_with_deep_learning_and_remotely_sensed_data","304716250_Apple_detection_in_natural_tree_canopies_from_multimodal_images","303885547_Texture-based_fruit_detection_via_images_using_the_smooth_patterns_on_the_fruit","303505510_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","303371730_Visual_Detection_of_Occluded_Crop_for_automated_harvesting","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","286706047_Detecting_Mango_Fruits_by_Using_Randomized_Hough_Transform_and_Backpropagation_Neural_Network","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284106199_Pear_fruit_growth_and_the_use_of_diameter_to_estimate_fruit_volume_and_weight","282407024_Modelling_Apple_Fruit_Yield_Using_Image_Analysis_for_Fruit_Colour_Shape_and_Texture"]}
