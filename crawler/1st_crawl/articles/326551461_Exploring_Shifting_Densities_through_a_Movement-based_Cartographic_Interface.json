{"id":"326551461_Exploring_Shifting_Densities_through_a_Movement-based_Cartographic_Interface","abstract":"Animated maps are widely used for representing shifting densities. Though there is evidence that animations can provide better memory recall than static charts, it could be a consequence of using better techniques for animation than for static representations. However, the lack of control makes them frustrating for users, while animated choropleth maps can cause change blindness. In this paper, we propose an interactive animation technique which employs the lenticular printing metaphor and benefits from the user's proprioceptive sense to explore density changes over time. We hypothesized that using a tangible interface based on the body movement would improve memory recall and, consequently, animated map reading.","authors":["Aline Menin","Luciana Nedel","Paule-Annick Davoine","Sonia Chardonnel"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.GISCIENCE.2018.48","Conference: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCEAt: Melbourne, Australia","Project: Visualization of Daily Mobility Data"],"references":["322881549_SOLACE_a_multi-agent_model_of_human_behaviour_driven_by_social_attachment_during_seismic_crisis","318761785_The_Hologram_in_My_Hand_How_Effective_is_Interactive_Exploration_of_3D_Visualizations_in_Immersive_Tangible_Augmented_Reality","306051856_Hybrid_TactileTangible_Interaction_for_3D_Data_Exploration","320313193_Investigating_the_Use_of_Spatial_Interaction_for_3D_Data_Visualization_on_Mobile_Devices","319982566_The_daycourse_of_place","313800384_Social_segregation_around_the_clock_in_the_Paris_region_France","278820550_Geovisualisation_pour_la_reduction_de_la_vulnerabilite_socio-spatiale_en_milieu_urbain","278817903_La_carte_animee_pour_reveler_les_rythmes_urbains","253707890_Visualizing_Change_Using_Cartographic_Animation_to_Explore_Remotely-Sensed_Data","243749475_Stretching_Space_and_Splicing_Time_From_Cartographic_Animation_to_Interactive_Visualization"]}
