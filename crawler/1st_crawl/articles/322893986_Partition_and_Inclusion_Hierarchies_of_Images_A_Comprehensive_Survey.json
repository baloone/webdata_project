{"id":"322893986_Partition_and_Inclusion_Hierarchies_of_Images_A_Comprehensive_Survey","abstract":"The theory of hierarchical image representations has been well-established in Mathematical Morphology, and provides a suitable framework to handle images through objects or regions taking into account their scale. Such approaches have increased in popularity and been favourably compared to treating individual image elements in various domains and applications. This survey paper presents the development of hierarchical image representations over the last\n20 years using the framework of component trees. We introduce two classes of component trees, partitioning and inclusion trees, and describe their general characteristics and differences. Examples of hierarchies for each of the classes are compared, with the resulting study aiming to serve as a guideline when choosing a hierarchical image representation for any application and image domain.","authors":["Petra Bosilj","Ewa Kijak","Sébastien Lefèvre"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Imaging 4(2):33","DOI:10.3390/jimaging4020033","Project: Image indexing and retrieval with component trees"],"references":["320822345_Hyperspectral_image_classification_from_multiscale_description_with_constrained_connectivity_and_metric_learning","320600284_Local_Feature-Based_Attribute_Profiles_for_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","320535764_Hierarchical_Segmentations_with_Graphs_Quasi-flat_Zones_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_and_Saliency_Maps","316048473_Evaluation_of_Combinations_of_Watershed_Hierarchies","315778561_A_Hybrid_Shared-Memory_Parallel_Max-Tree_Algorithm_for_Extreme_Dynamic-Range_Images","321236230_Feature_Profiles_from_Attribute_Filtering_for_Classification_of_Remote_Sensing_Images","319207907_Pattern_Classification","316751714_Object_Tracking_by_Hierarchical_Decomposition_of_Hyperspectral_Video_Sequences_Application_to_Chemical_Gas_Plume_Tracking","316064732_Attribute_Profiles_from_Partitioning_Trees","316051376_Ultimate_Opening_Combined_with_Area_Stability_Applied_to_Urban_Scenes"]}
