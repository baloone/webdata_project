{"id":"266552387_Convex_ordering_of_random_variables_and_its_applications_in_econometrics_and_actuarial_science","abstract":"It is well known that in economics and finance, the data usually have “fat tail” and in this case the normal distribution is not a good model to use. The skew normal distributions recently draw considerable attention as an alternative model. Unfortunately, the distribution of the sum of log-skew normal random variables does not have a closed form. We discuss the use of lower convex order of random variables to approximate this distribution. Further, two application of this approximate distribution are given : first to describe the final wealth of a series of payments, and second to describe the present value of a series of payments.","authors":["Arjun Gupta","Mohammad A.S.
