{"id":"339510443_Designing_an_Assessment_for_Introductory_Programming_Concepts_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","abstract":"Teaching of computer science (CS) and programming is rapidly expanding in formal school education. Learning to program is a key ingredient of school CS curricula, and consequently quality measurements of student learning of foundational programming concepts are needed by teachers and researchers. However, high- quality tools for measuring student learning in introductory CS have been under-developed and under-researched. This experience report shares the process of design and refinement of a summative paper- based assessment (that could also be administered online) for introductory programming in middle grades (6-8). We share our experiences with the use of assessment as a pre-post measure in a middle school introductory programming course in diverse, urban school classrooms in the US and use that data to conduct validity, reliability and item discrimination analyses.","authors":["Shuchi Grover"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1145/3328778.3366896","Conference: SIGCSE '20: The 51st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education","Project: Introductory Programming"],"references":["331302029_Development_of_a_Lean_Computational_Thinking_Abilities_Assessment_for_Middle_Grades_Students","330916641_Concepts_before_coding_non-programming_interactives_to_advance_learning_of_introductory_programming_concepts_in_middle_school","319325770_A_Framework_for_Using_Hypothesis-Driven_Approaches_to_Support_Data-Driven_Learning_Analytics_in_Measuring_Computational_Thinking_in_Block-Based_Programming_Environments","317644528_Assessment_Design_Patterns_for_Computational_Thinking_Practices_in_Secondary_Computer_Science_A_First_Look","316442298_Assessing_Algorithmic_and_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Lessons_from_a_Middle_School_Classroom","314296105_Measuring_Student_Learning_in_Introductory_Block-Based_Programming_Examining_Misconceptions_of_Loops_Variables_and_Boolean_Logic","294878622_Factors_Influencing_Computer_Science_Learning_in_Middle_School","290391277_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_TEST_DESIGN_GUIDELINES_AND_CONTENT_VALIDATION","319133079_Principled_Assessment_of_Student_Learning_in_High_School_Computer_Science","317160209_Learnable_Programming_Blocks_and_Beyond"]}
