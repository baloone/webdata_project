{"id":"320074531_Crowdsourcing_Technology_to_Support_Academic_Research","abstract":"Current crowdsourcing platforms typically concentrate on simple microtasks and do not meet the needs of academic research well, where more complex, time consuming studies are required. This has lead to the development of specialised software tools to support academic research on such platforms. However, the loose coupling of the software with the crowdsourcing site means that there is only limited access to the features of the platform. In addition, the specialised nature of the software tools means that technical knowledge is needed to operate them. Hence there is great potential to enrich the features of crowdsourcing platforms from an academic perspective. In this chapter we discuss the possibilities for practical improvement of academic crowdsourced studies through adaption of technological solutions.","authors":["Matthias Hirth","Jason Jacques","Peter Rodgers","Ognjen Scekic"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66435-4_4","In book: Evaluation in the Crowd.
