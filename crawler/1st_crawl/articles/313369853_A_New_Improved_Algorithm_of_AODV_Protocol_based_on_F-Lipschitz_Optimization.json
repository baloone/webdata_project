{"id":"313369853_A_New_Improved_Algorithm_of_AODV_Protocol_based_on_F-Lipschitz_Optimization","abstract":"With the rapid development and the daily appearance of the new tiny materials, the new technology attracts more and more the research community. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks offer various applications to users. However, This technology still suffer from routing problems. The main goal of this paper is to present a new enhanced algorithm of AODV protocol which is based on optimizing the number of RREQ messages using the F- Lipschitz optimization. The novel proposed approach focus on two parameters: distance and energy for enhancing routing performances. Simulation results show that the new protocol outperforms the basic AODV.","authors":["Layla Aziz","Said Raghay","Hanane Aznaoui","Abdellah Jamali"],"meta":["December 2016Indian Journal of Science and Technology 9(48)","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i48/108318"],"references":[]}
