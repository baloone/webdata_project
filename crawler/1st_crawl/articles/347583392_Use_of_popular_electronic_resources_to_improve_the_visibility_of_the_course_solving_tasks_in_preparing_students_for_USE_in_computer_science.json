The unified state exam in computer science includes 27 tasks of various levels of complexity. Analysis of statistics on the success of various tasks shows that students experience the greatest difficulties when solving task number 23. To increase the visibility of the process of solving this task, you can use the well-known electronic resource MS Excel, which is part of the Microsoft MSOffice package. This electronic resource has a built-in programming language Visual Basic for Application, with which you can significantly expand the functionality of MS Excel. Written in Visual Basic for Application, the macro allows the student not only to get the correct answer, but also to view the problem solution tree, compare it with their own solution, and identify errors in their solution if there is a discrepancy. This article is devoted to the methodology of using this electronic resource in the process of preparing students for the unified state exam in computer science.","authors":["O D Lyubutov","O Yu Zaslavskaya"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1691(1):012091","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1691/1/012091"],"references":[]}
