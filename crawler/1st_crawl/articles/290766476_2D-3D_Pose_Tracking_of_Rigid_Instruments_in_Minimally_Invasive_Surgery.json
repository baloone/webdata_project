{"id":"290766476_2D-3D_Pose_Tracking_of_Rigid_Instruments_in_Minimally_Invasive_Surgery","abstract":"Instrument localization and tracking is an important challenge for advanced computer assisted techniques in minimally invasive surgery and image-based solutions to instrument localization can provide a non-invasive, low cost solution. In this study, we present a novel algorithm capable of recovering the 3D pose of laparoscopic surgical instruments combining constraints from a classification algorithm, multiple point features, stereo views (when available) and a linear motion model to robustly track the tool in surgical videos. We demonstrate the improved robustness and performance of our algorithm with optically tracked ground truth and additionally qualitatively demonstrate its performance on in vivo images.","authors":["Max Allan","Steve Thompson","Matt Clarkson","SÃ©bastien Ourselin"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07521-1_1","Conference: International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions"],"references":["267985080_Articulated_Surgical_Tool_Detection_Using_Virtually-Rendered_Templates","252129184_Recognition_of_risk_situations_based_on_endoscopic_instrument_tracking_and_knowledge_based_situation_Modeling_-_art_no_69180X","234049016_Data-Driven_Visual_Tracking_in_Retinal_Microsurgery","233798291_Toward_Detection_and_Localization_of_Instruments_in_Minimally_Invasive_Surgery","319770212_Computer_Vision_Models_Learning_and_Inference","310439326_A_review_of_statistical_approaches_to_level_set_segmentation_Integrating_color_texture_motion_and_shape","264955417_Computer_vision_Models_learning_and_inference_Foreword_by_Andrew_Fitzgibbon","261960347_Appearance_learning_for_3D_tracking_of_robotic_surgical_tools","261036135_On_constrained_manipulation_in_robotics-assisted_minimally_invasive_surgery","248383427_Optical_techniques_for_3D_surface_reconstruction_in_computer-assisted_laparoscopic_surgery"]}
