{"id":"252971291_Magnetic_Anisotropy_and_Magnetostriction_of_Ordered_and_Disordered_Cobalt-Iron_Alloys","abstract":"The magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction of single crystals of alloys between 25 weight % and 59weight % cobalt in iron have been determined in the disordered and ordered states. The magnetostrictionis large and positive for all alloys in both states of order (up to 150×10−6 for λ100 and 40×10−6 for λ111). Themagnetic anisotropy becomes zero near 41% Co for the disordered state. Ordering shifts the zero-anisotropycomposition to about 50% Co.","authors":["R. C.
