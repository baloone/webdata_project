{"id":"322236395_6DoF_Object_Tracking_based_on_3D_Scans_for_Augmented_Reality_Remote_Live_Support","abstract":"Tracking the 6DoF pose of arbitrary 3D objects is a fundamental topic in Augmented Reality (AR) research, having received a large amount of interest in the last decades. The necessity of accurate and computationally efficient object tracking is evident for a broad base of todayâ€™s AR applications. In this work we present a fully comprehensive pipeline for 6DoF Object Tracking based on 3D scans of objects, covering object registration, initialization and frame to frame tracking, implemented to optimize the user experience and to perform well in all typical challenging conditions such as fast motion, occlusions and illumination changes. Furthermore, we present the deployment of our tracking system in a Remote Live Support AR application with 3D object-aware registration of annotations and remote execution for delay and performance optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the tracking quality, real-time capability and the advantages of remote execution for computationally less powerful mobile devices.","authors":["Jason Rambach","Alain Pagani","Michael Schneider","Alexander Artemenko"],"meta":["January 2018Computers 7(1):6","DOI:10.3390/computers7010006","Project: proWiLAN"],"references":["321150201_Supporting_Training_of_Expertise_with_Wearable_Technologies_The_WEKIT_Reference_Framework","319894310_Supporting_Remote_Maintenance_in_Industry_40_through_Augmented_Reality","318420987_POSTER_Augmented_Things_Enhancing_AR_Applications_leveraging_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Universal_3D_Object_Tracking","318235730_Visual_SLAM_algorithms_a_survey_from_2010_to_2016","313964585_A_Direct_Method_for_Robust_Model-Based_3D_Object_Tracking_from_a_Monocular_RGB_Image","318183569_Augmented_Reality_Entertainment_Taking_Gaming_Out_of_the_Box","317099392_Next_Generation_Industrial_Radio_LAN_for_Tactile_and_Safety_Applications","287348989_Pose_Estimation_for_Augmented_Reality_A_Hands-On_Survey","284870153_Augmented_Reality_Teaching_and_Learning","284653335_Iterative_point_matching_for_registration_of_free-from_curves_and_surfaces"]}
