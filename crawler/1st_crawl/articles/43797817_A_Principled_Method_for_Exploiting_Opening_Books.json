{"id":"43797817_A_Principled_Method_for_Exploiting_Opening_Books","abstract":"We used in the past a lot of computational power and human expertise for having a very big dataset of good 9x9 Go games, in order to build an opening book. We improved a lot the algorithm used for gen- erating these games. Unfortunately, the results were not very robust, as (i) opening books are definitely not transitive, making the non-regression testing extremely difficult and (ii) different time settings lead to opposite conclusions, because a good opening for a game with 10s per move on a single core is very different from a good opening for a game with 30s per move on a 32-cores machine (iii) some very bad moves sometimes occur. In this paper, we formalize the optimization of an opening book as a matrix game, compute the Nash equilibrium, and conclude that a naturally randomized opening book provides optimal performance (in the sense of Nash equilibria); surprisingly, from a finite set of opening books, we can choose a distribution on these opening books so that this random solution has a significantly better performance than each of the deterministic opening book.","authors":["Romaric Gaudel","Jean-Baptiste Hoock","Julien Perez","Nataliya Sokolovska"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-17928-0_13","Conference: Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Computers and games"],"references":["224396569_The_Computational_Intelligence_of_MoGo_Revealed_in_Taiwan's_Computer_Go_Tournaments","221476487_Improving_Opening_Book_Performance_Through_Modeling_of_Chess_Opponents","220867712_Grid_Coevolution_for_Adaptive_Simulations_Application_to_the_Building_of_Opening_Books_in_the_Game_of_Go","220660874_Optimizing_fixed-size_stochastic_controllers_for_POMDPs_and_decentralized_POMDPs","40902716_Consistency_Modifications_for_Automatically_Tuned_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","29651027_Combining_Online_and_Offline_Knowledge_in_UCT","242688803_An_Iterative_Method_of_Solving_a_Game","222475024_Korf_RE_Depth-first_iterative-deepening_an_optimal_admissible_tree_search_Artif_Intell_27_97-109","220814995_Iterative-Deepening-A_An_Optimal_Admissible_Tree_Search","220717007_Innovative_Opening-Book_Handling","23751525_SELF-PLAYING-BASED_OPENING_BOOK_TUNING","2536145_Toward_Opening_Book_Learning"]}
