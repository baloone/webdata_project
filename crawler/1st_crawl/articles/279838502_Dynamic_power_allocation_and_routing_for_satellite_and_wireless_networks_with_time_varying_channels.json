In order to reliably integrate these systems into a high speed data network and meet the increasing demand for high throughput and low delay, it is necessary to develop efficient network layer strategies that fully utilize the physical layer capabilities of each network element. In this thesis, we develop the notion of network layer capacity and describe capacity achieving power allocation and routing algorithms for general networks with wireless links and adaptive transmission rates. Fundamental issues of delay, throughput optimality, fairness, implementation complexity, and robustness to time varying channel conditions and changing user demands are discussed. Analysis is performed at the packet level and fully considers the queueing dynamics in systems with arbitrary, potentially bursty, arrival processes. Applications of this research are examined for the specific cases of satellite networks and ad-hoc wireless networks. Indeed, in Chapter 3 we consider a multi-beam satellite downlink and develop a dynamic power allocation algorithm that allocates power to each link in reaction to queue backlog and current channel conditions. The algorithm operates without knowledge of the arriving traffic or channel statistics, and is shown to achieve maximum throughput while maintaining average delay guarantees. At the end of Chapter 4, a crosslinked collection of such satellites is considered and a satellite separation principle is developed, demonstrating that joint optimal control can be implemented with separate algorithms for the downlinks and crosslinks.","authors":["Neely, Michael J.
