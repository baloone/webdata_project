{"id":"322196005_Investigating_Self-Efficacy_Anxiety_Attitudes_and_Mathematics_Achievement_Regarding_Gender_and_School_Type","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among seventh grade studentsâ€™ mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety, attitudes towards mathematics, mathematics achievement, gender and school type. In order to examine the difference in self-efficacy, anxiety, attitude and achievement in terms of gender and school type, two-way ANO-VAs were performed. In addition, multiple regression analysis was run to investigate the role of mathematics self-efficacy, anxiety, attitude, gender and school type in predicting mathematics achievement of seventh grade students. Results revealed that there was a significant main effect of gender on mean mathematics self-efficacy scores, attitude scores, anxiety scores and mathematics achievement. However, school type did not have significant main effect on mean self-efficacy scores, anxiety scores, and achieve-ment scores but have significant effect on attitude scores. Findings also supported that self-efficacy, anxiety, attitude, gender and school type significantly predicted the achievement scores of seventh grade students.","authors":["Senol Recber","Mine Isiksal","Yusuf Koc"],"meta":["January 2018Anales de Psicologia 34(1):41-51","DOI:10.6018/analesps.34.1.229571"],"references":["278715807_Self-Efficacy_as_an_Engaged_Learner","275006105_Mathematics_Anxiety_Mathematics_Performance_and_Overall_Academic_Performance_in_High_School_Students","271584027_Mathematics_Anxiety_among_Sixth_and_Seventh_Grade_Turkish_Elementary_School_Students","314409694_Update_on_Attitudes_and_Other_Affective_Variables_in_Learning_Mathematics","284490624_Self-efficacy_during_childhood_and_adolescence_Implications_for_teachers_and_parents","284442163_Beyond_Unification","272717664_Attitiude_towards_Mathematics_and_Achademic_Achievement_in_Mathematics_among_Secondary_Level_Boys_and_Girls","271814224_Assessing_the_Relationship_between_Attitude_toward_Mathematics_and_Achievement_in_Mathematics_A_Meta-Analysis","271697564_The_Nature_Effects_and_Relief_of_Mathematics_Anxiety","271347346_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Relationship_between_Anxiety_toward_Mathematics_and_Achievement_in_Mathematics"]}
