{"id":"310605384_Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages_Tools_for_Effective_Communication_on_Application's_User_Interface","abstract":"Abstract: To an application user, the application is as good as the user interface. The beauty of a good applicationâ€™s user-Interface is dependents on the effectiveness of the communication between the hardware, software and the humanware (user). This paper examines the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming languages as a tool for an effective communication in a user-interface. Information from secondary sources was gathered, studied and through an object-oriented methodology, a detailed analysis and design\nwas adopted to create a simple arithmetic and trigonometric drill application with a good user interface. MATLAB Version 7.7.0 was used as the object oriented programming tool to implement the application. The created simple arithmetic and trigonometric drill application has advanced features to perform mathematical and trigonometric functions effortlessly.","authors":["Barida Baah","Fergus Uchenna Onu","Akiene Promise T.K."],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) 5(8):406-411","Project: POP and Modern software development"],"references":["305993292_Parameters_for_the_Evaluation_for_the_Choice_of_a_Good_Programming_Language","283202529_Impacts_of_Object_Oriented_Programming_on_Web_Application_Development","261151374_Blocks_languages_for_creating_tangible_artifacts","254706809_Graphical_User_Interface_-_Layout_and_Design","263381405_Empowering_educators_with_Google's_Android_App_Inventor_An_online_workshop_in_mobile_app_design","248688626_Object_-_oriented_Software_Construction_Prentice_-_Hall_Int","238601519_Subgoal-labeled_instructional_material_improves_performance_and_transfer_in_learning_to_develop_mobile_applications","220391584_Concepts_and_Paradigms_of_Object-Oriented_Programming","30873047_Object_Oriented_Software_Construction"]}
