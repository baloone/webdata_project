{"id":"310839175_The_Bricklayer_Ecosystem_-_Art_Math_and_Code","abstract":"This paper describes the Bricklayer Ecosystem - a freely-available online educational ecosystem created for people of all ages and coding backgrounds. Bricklayer is designed in accordance with a \"low-threshold infinite ceiling\" philosophy and has been successfully used to teach coding to primary school students, middle school students, university freshmen, and in-service secondary math teachers. Bricklayer programs are written in the functional programming language SML and, when executed, create 2D and 3D artifacts. These artifacts can be viewed using a variety of third-party tools such as LEGO Digital Designer (LDD), LDraw, Minecraft clients, Brickr, as well as STereoLithography viewers.","authors":["Victor L.
