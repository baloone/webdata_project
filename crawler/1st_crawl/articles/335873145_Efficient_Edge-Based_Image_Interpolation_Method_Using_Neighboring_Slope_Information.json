{"id":"335873145_Efficient_Edge-Based_Image_Interpolation_Method_Using_Neighboring_Slope_Information","abstract":"This paper presents an image interpolation method that provides superior performance with low complexity. Applying a simple linear method achieves time-efficient interpolation, but often produces artifacts; however, applying other complex methods reduce unwanted artifacts at the cost of high computation time. The proposed interpolation scheme is based on the improvement of an algorithm called “Edge Slope Tracing (EST)„ that predicts the slope based on the information of the adjacent slopes. Predicted slopes are used in slope-based line averaging to perform the interpolation. Slope-based line averaging is followed by post-processing of an interpolated image using two-way interpolation and thin edge correction to avoid the production of unwanted artifacts at the cost of low complexity. The proposed algorithm is very simple and simulation results indicate that it provides better or nearly equal results compared to conventional state-of-the-art algorithms and that it also reduces complexity to a great extent compared to conventional methods.","authors":["Sajid Khan","Dong-Ho Lee","Muhammad Asif Khan","Abdul Rehman Gilal"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942004","Projects: Image Super-resolutionoccupational stress, serum cortisol level among university teachers"],"references":["320463638_Medical_image_resolution_enhancement_for_healthcare_using_nonlocal_self-similarity_and_low-rank_prior","317989681_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_Sparse_Representation_via_Direction_and_Edge_Dictionaries","324959844_Effects_of_Viewing_Ultra-High-Resolution_Images_With_Practical_Viewing_Distances_on_Familiar_Impressions","323877594_Image_super-resolution_via_adaptive_sparse_representation_and_self-learning","283445263_Efficient_deinterlacing_method_using_simple_edge_slope_tracing","262323537_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution","258688544_Filter_switching_interpolation_method_for_deinterlacing","234123917_Sparse_Representation_Based_Image_Interpolation_With_Nonlocal_Autoregressive_Modeling","228574989_A_survey_on_evaluation_methods_for_image_interpolation","224227390_Real-Time_Artifact-Free_Image_Upscaling"]}
