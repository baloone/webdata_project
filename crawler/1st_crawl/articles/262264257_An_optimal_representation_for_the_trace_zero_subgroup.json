{"id":"262264257_An_optimal_representation_for_the_trace_zero_subgroup","abstract":"We give an optimal-size representation for the elements of the trace zero\nsubgroup of the Picard group of an elliptic or hyperelliptic curve of any\ngenus, with respect to a field extension of any prime degree. The\nrepresentation is via the coefficients of a rational function, and it is\ncompatible with scalar multiplication of points. We provide efficient\ncompression and decompression algorithms, and complement them with\nimplementation results. We discuss in detail the practically relevant cases of\nsmall genus and extension degree, and compare with the other known compression\nmethods.","authors":["Elisa Gorla","Maike Massierer"],"meta":["June 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 83(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0249-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265777399_Efficient_and_secure_algorithms_for_GLV-based_scalar_multiplication_and_their_implementation_on_GLV-GLS_curves_extended_version","262399977_High-Performance_Scalar_Multiplication_Using_8-Dimensional_GLVGLS_Decomposition","262108387_Index_Calculus_in_the_Trace_Zero_Variety","260870218_Lambda_Coordinates_for_Binary_Elliptic_Curves","260870125_Two_is_the_fastest_prime_Lambda_coordinates_for_binary_elliptic_curves","260482292_Point_compression_for_the_trace_zero_subgroup_over_a_small_degree_extension_field","272352316_Four-Dimensional_Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone_Scalar_Multiplication","272182752_Efficient_and_secure_algorithms_for_GLV-based_scalar_multiplication_and_their_implementation_on_GLV-GLS_curves","266076049_Elliptic_Curves_Number_Theory_and_Cryptography","262257264_Factor-4_and_6_DeCompression_for_Values_of_Pairings_Using_Trace_Maps"]}
