{"id":"311663534_Butterfly_micro_bilayer_thermal_energy_harvester_geometry_with_improved_performances","abstract":"This paper reports the recent progress of a new technology to scavenge thermal energy, implying a double-step transduction through thermal buckling of a bilayer aluminum nitride / aluminum bridge and piezoelectric transduction. A completely new scavenger design is presented, improving greatly its final performance. The butterfly shape reduces the overall device mechanical rigidity, which leads to a decrease of buckling temperatures compared to previously studied rectangular plates. In a first time we compared performances of rectangular and butterfly plates with an equal thickness of Al and AlN. In a second time, with a thicker Al layer than AlN layer, we will study only butterfly structure in terms of output power and buckling temperatures, and compare it to the previous stack.","authors":["Emilie Trioux","Stephane Monfray","Skandar BASROUR"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Physics Conference Series 773(1):012094","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/773/1/012094"],"references":["258038769_A_Thermoelectric_Generator_Using_Porous_Si_Thermal_Isolation","257710176_Thermoelectric_Energy_Harvesting_from_Transient_Ambient_Temperature_Gradients","225443207_Vibration_energy_scavenging_via_piezoelectric_bimorphs_of_optimized_shapes","231077817_Detailed_study_of_a_micro_heat_engine_for_thermal_energy_harvesting"]}
