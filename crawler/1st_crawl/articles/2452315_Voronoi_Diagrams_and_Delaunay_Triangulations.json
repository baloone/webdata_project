{"id":"2452315_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_Delaunay_Triangulations","abstract":"Introduction The Voronoi diagram of a set of sites partitions space into regions, one per site; the region for a site s consists of all points closer to s than to any other site. The dual of the Voronoi diagram, the Delaunay triangulation, is the unique triangulation so that the circumsphere of every triangle contains no sites in its interior. Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations have been rediscovered or applied in many areas of mathematics and the natural sciences; they are central topics in computational geometry, with hundreds of papers discussing algorithms and extensions. Section 2 discusses the definition and basic properties in the usual case of point sites in R d with the Euclidean metric, while section 3 gives basic algorithms. Some of the many extensions obtained by varying metric, sites, environment, and constraints are discussed in section 4. Section 5 finishes with some interesting and nonobvious","authors":["Steven Fortune"],"meta":["October 1999","DOI:10.1142/9789814355858_0006"],"references":["258224621_Minimal_roughness_property_of_the_Delaunay_triangulation","234796134_Multiplicatively_weighted_crystal_growth_Voronoi_diagrams_extended_abstract","225640991_Optimality_of_the_Delaunay_Triangulation_in_R","220431260_Two-Dimensional_Voronoi_Diagrams_in_the_L","220183513_Primitives_for_the_Manipulation_of_General_Subdivisions_and_Computation_of_Voronoi_Diagrams","3593560_Efficient_computation_of_Euclidean_shortest_paths_in_the_plane","270077633_Algorithms_in_Combinatorial_Geometry","234039045_A_Brief_Description_of_Natural_Neighbor_Interpolation","226164212_An_acyclicity_theorem_for_cell_complex_in_d_dimension","225835247_On_the_geodesic_Voronoi_diagram_of_point_sites_in_a_simple_polygon","225526118_A_linear-time_algorithm_for_computing_the_Voronoi_diagram_of_a_convex_polygon","225348714_Higher-dimensional_voronoi_diagrams_in_linear_expected_time","222455040_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Constructing_the_Weighted_Voronoi_Diagram_in_the_Plane","221590739_Constructing_Higher-Dimensional_Convex_Hulls_at_Logarithmic_Cost_per_Face","220983561_Voronoi_diagrams_based_on_convex_distance_functions","220690393_Computational_Geometry_An_Introduction_Through_Randomized_Algorithms","220670048_A_simple_on-line_randomized_incremental_algorithm_for_computing_higher_order_Voronoi_diagrams","220616351_Power_Diagrams_Properties_Algorithms_and_Applications","220565961_Voronoi_Diagrams_-_A_Survey_of_Fundamental_Geometric_Data_Structure","47842090_Randomized_Incremental_Construction_of_Abstract_Voronoi_Diagrams","47389428_Constructing_Levels_in_Arrangements_and_Higher_Order_Voronoi_Diagrams","3510337_An_optimal_convex_hull_algorithm_and_new_results_on_cuttings","2253422_A_Linear-Time_Randomized_Algorithm_for_the_Bounded_Voronoi_Diagram_of_a_Simple_Polygon"]}
