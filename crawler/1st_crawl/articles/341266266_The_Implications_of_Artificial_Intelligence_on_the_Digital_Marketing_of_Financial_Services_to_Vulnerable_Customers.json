{"id":"341266266_The_Implications_of_Artificial_Intelligence_on_the_Digital_Marketing_of_Financial_Services_to_Vulnerable_Customers","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming digital marketing practices. While the extant literature extensively covers AI applications that generally benefit businesses and customers, there is scant research on AI deployments that exacerbate problems for financially vulnerable customers. These customers have limited access to financial systems, services or technologies. To rectify this research deficit, this paper describes the challenges confronting businesses as they attempt to integrate AI into the digital marketing of their financial services. Ultimately, AI-enabled digital marketing is not as simple as collecting big data and using analytical algorithms; the technology may not always help businesses target their customers more effectively. This paper examines the relationships between AI, digital marketing, and financial services in relation to vulnerable customers, highlighting key implications in the collection, processing, and delivery of information, as well as the importance of human connection for optimal customer experience and engagement with financial services providers. Understanding ethical implications, as well as data and modelling challenges, is necessary for the successful deployment of AI. This study provides a theoretical framework to financial services providers, AI developers, marketers, policymakers, and academics, aiding the understanding of the precarious conditions facing vulnerable customers, and the ways in which they can more effectively be reached.","authors":["Emmanuel Mogaji","Taiwo O Soetan","Tai Anh Kieu"],"meta":["May 2020Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ) 29(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ausmj.2020.05.003","Project: Financial Vulnerability"],"references":["341490274_Towards_ethical_financial_innovation_and_inclusion_implications_of_AI_targeting_on_vulnerable_individuals_seeking_pay_day_loans","339113524_Collaborative_intelligence_How_human_and_artificial_intelligence_create_value_along_the_B2B_sales_funnel","337197234_Using_AI_to_Personalise_Emotionally_Appealing_Advertisement","336046481_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Machine_Learning_as_business_tools_a_framework_for_diagnosing_value_destruction_potential","334539401_A_Brief_History_of_Artificial_Intelligence_On_the_Past_Present_and_Future_of_Artificial_Intelligence","334368270_Letting_the_Computers_Take_Over_Using_AI_to_Solve_Marketing_Problems","334200435_How_Artificial_Intelligence_Affects_Digital_Marketing","330907175_Artificial_Intelligence_Hits_the_Barrier_of_Meaning","328413117_Digital_Marketing_Strategies_Based_on_the_E-Business_Model_Literature_Review_and_Future_Directions","328192688_Mapping_the_challenges_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_public_sector_Evidence_from_public_healthcare","327535215_Artificial_Intelligence_in_public_health_Opportunities_and_challenges","327530187_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Public_Health_Opportunities_and_Challenges","322958062_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Service","318033558_Online_Behavioral_Advertising_A_Literature_Review_and_Research_Agenda","314139647_Heading_toward_Artificial_Intelligence_20","312450097_Nurturing_a_FinTech_ecosystem_The_case_of_a_youth_microloan_startup_in_China","307443102_Factors_shaping_attitudes_towards_UK_bank_brands_An_exploratory_analysis_of_social_media_data","259452104_Understanding_Gen_Y_and_their_use_of_social_media_A_review_and_research_agenda","349547798_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Marketing_Practical_Applications","338290367_AI-enabled_recruiting_What_is_it_and_how_should_a_manager_use_it","337324464_How_are_we_tempted_into_debt_Emotional_appeals_in_loan_advertisements_in_UK_newspapers","336202538_Factors_that_influence_new_generation_candidates_to_engage_with_and_complete_digital_AI-enabled_recruiting","335435943_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_Multidisciplinary_perspectives_on_emerging_challenges_opportunities_and_agenda_for_research_practice_and_policy","334523032_Keeping_Humans_in_the_Loop_Pooling_Knowledge_through_Artificial_Swarm_Intelligence_to_Improve_Business_Decision_Making","334252645_Understanding_the_Role_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Personalized_Engagement_Marketing","329689598_Conceptualizing_the_multiple_dimensions_of_consumer_financial_vulnerability","328821395_Surprise_me_with_your_ads_The_impacts_of_guerrilla_marketing_in_social_media_on_brand_image","328262703_Insight_into_consumer_experience_on_UK_train_transportation_services","327691107_Marketing_AI_recruitment_The_next_phase_in_job_application_and_selection","326953716_When_Nothing_is_What_it_Seems_A_Digital_Marketing_Research_Agenda","326583645_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Public_Sector-Applications_and_Challenges","325991356_Artificial_intelligence_and_augmented_intelligence_collaboration_Regaining_trust_and_confidence_in_the_financial_sector","322777570_Artificial_intelligence_in_banks_today_Experience_and_perspectives","320535625_An_impulse_to_exploit_the_behavioral_turn_in_data-driven_marketing","319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","318983636_FinTech_Harnessing_Innovation_for_Financial_Inclusion","318920025_Making_the_brand_appealing_advertising_strategies_and_consumers'_attitude_towards_UK_retail_bank_brands","318180005_Big_Data_Analytics_A_Review_on_Theoretical_Contributions_and_Tools_Used_in_Literature","316058524_Redefining_the_bottom_of_the_pyramid_from_a_marketing_perspective","311393872_Digital_marketing_A_framework_review_and_research_agenda","311096433_The_digital_revolution_in_financial_inclusion_international_development_in_the_fintech_era","284194593_A_Market-Building_Approach_to_Financial_Inclusion","270914017_Wanted_Collaborative_intelligence","257730645_Elevating_marketing_Marketing_is_dead_Long_live_marketing","247737332_A_Note_on_the_Concept_of_Tacit_Knowledge","239847273_Tacit_Knowledge_and_Strategic_Decision_Making","236742230_Data-Driven_Services_Marketing_in_a_Connected_World","235306094_International_services_advertising_An_examination_of_variation_in_appeal_use_for_experiential_and_utilitarian_services","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","222492957_An_Architecture_for_Adaptive_Intelligent_Systems","200553079_Assessing_a_Firm's_Web_Presence_A_Heuristic_Evaluation_Procedure_for_the_Measurement_of_Usability"]}
