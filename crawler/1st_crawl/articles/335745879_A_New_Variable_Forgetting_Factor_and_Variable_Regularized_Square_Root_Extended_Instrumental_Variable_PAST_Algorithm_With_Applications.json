{"id":"335745879_A_New_Variable_Forgetting_Factor_and_Variable_Regularized_Square_Root_Extended_Instrumental_Variable_PAST_Algorithm_With_Applications","abstract":"This paper proposes a square-root (SR) extended instrumental variable (EIV) projection approximation subspace tracking (PAST) algorithm with variable forgetting factor (VFF) and variable regularization (VR). A new local polynomial modeling (LPM) based variable forgetting factor is proposed by minimizing the mean square deviation (MSD) of the EIV linear model and the IV-PAST algorithm. A new variable \n$\\ell_2$ \nregularization term is also derived to reduce the variance of the estimator resulting from possibly ill-conditioned covariance matrix at low input signal level. A square-root version of the algorithm is developed to improve the numerical stability of the algorithm and avoid the problem of loss of positive-definiteness of the inverse covariance matrix. The proposed LOFF-VR-SREIV-PAST algorithm can be implemented by both the conventional EIV-PAST algorithm and numerically more stable hyperbolic rotations. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed VFF-EIV-PAST algorithm using the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method is analyzed. Its application to the estimation and tracking of direction-of-arrival (DOA) under spatially color sensor noise in both stationary and nonstationary scenarios are presented. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields improved performance over the conventional PAST and EIV-PAST algorithms, especially at medium to low signal-tonoise ratio which is more frequently encountered in practical situations.","authors":["Shing Chow Chan","Hai-Jun Tan","Jian-Qiang Lin"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAES.2019.2940304"],"references":["293801267_Single-platform_passive_emitter_localization_with_bearing_and_Doppler-shift_measurements_using_pseudolinear_estimation_techniques","281427868_A_New_Local_Polynomial_Modeling-Based_Variable_Forgetting_Factor_RLS_Algorithm_and_Its_Acoustic_Applications","260711295_A_Generic_Instrumental_Variable_Approach_for_Industrial_Robot_Identification","239766354_DOA_Estimation_and_Tracking_of_ULAs_with_Mutual_Coupling","224647324_A_new_adaptive_Kalman_filter-based_subspace_tracking_algorithm_and_its_application_to_DOA_estimation","224459719_Identification_and_Autotuning_of_Temperature-Control_System_With_Application_to_Injection_Molding","224333214_A_Robust_Variable_Forgetting_Factor_Recursive_Least-Squares_Algorithm_for_System_Identification","224171153_Local_Polynomial_Modeling_and_Variable_Bandwidth_Selection_for_Time-Varying_Linear_Systems","3319350_Fast_Approximated_Power_Iteration_Subspace_Tracking","3317834_Square-root_QR_inverse_iteration_for_tracking_the_minor_subspace","327486542_Instrumental_Variable_Based_Kalman_Filter_Algorithm_for_Three-Dimensional_AOA_Target_Tracking","322688753_A_New_Local_Polynomial_Modeling-Based_Variable_Forgetting_Factor_and_Variable_Regularized_PAST_Algorithm_for_Subspace_Tracking","269261571_An_Optimal_Instrumental_Variable_Method_for_Continuous-Time_Fractional_Model_Identification","268240434_An_optimal_instrumental_variable_approach_for_identifying_hybrid_continuous-time_Box-Jenkins_models","260699421_A_New_Variable_Regularized_QR_Decomposition-Based_Recursive_Least_M-Estimate_Algorithm-Performance_Analysis_and_Acoustic_Applications","258655836_Recursive_Least-Squares_Source_Tracking_using_One_Acoustic_Vector_Sensor","254222910_A_generalised_instrumental_variable_estimator_for_multivariable_errors-in-variables_identification_problems","254059136_Robust_Recursive_Eigendecomposition_and_Subspace-Based_Algorithms_With_Application_to_Fault_Detection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","226007288_System_identification_from_noisy_measurements_by_using_instrumental_variables_and_subspace_fitting","222896634_Asymptotic_convergence_analysis_of_the_projection_approximation_subspace_tracking_algorithms","222758859_The_fast_recursive_row-Householder_subspace_tracking_algorithm","222686826_Convergence_analysis_of_instrumental_variable_recursive_subspace_identification_algorithms","222655851_An_Optimal_IV_Technique_for_Identifying_Continuous-Time_Transfer_Function_Model_of_Multiple_Input_Systems","222433008_Propagator-based_methods_for_recursive_subspace_model_identification","52008277_The_Algebraic_Eigenvalue_Problem","4743910_Variable_Selection_via_Nonconcave_Penalized_Likelihood_and_Its_Oracle_Properties","3690664_Experimental_Study_Of_The_Identification_Methods_For_An_Industrial_Robot_Manipulator","3639546_Instrumental_variable_subspace_tracking_with_applications_to_sensorarray_processing_and_frequency_estimation","3342678_Fast_algorithms_for_subspace_tracking","3342116_An_Extension_of_the_PASTd_Algorithm_to_Both_Rank_and_Subspace_Tracking","3333530_A_Signal_Subspace_Tracking_Algorithm_for_Microphone_Array_Processing_of_Speech","3319533_A_robust_past_algorithm_for_subspace_tracking_in_impulsive_noise","3319386_Gradient-based_variable_forgetting_factor_RLS_algorithm_in_time-varying_environment","3316751_Instrumental_Variable_Subspace_Tracking_Using_Projection_Approximation","3315295_Projection_Approximation_Subspace_Tracking","3219205_Identification_of_Continuous-Time_Systems_Using_Instrumental_Variables_with_Application_to_an_Industrial_Robot","3178124_ESPRIT-A_Subspace_Rotation_Approach_to_Estimation_of_Parameters_of_Cisoids_in_Noise","3175203_Tracking_improvement_in_fast_RLS_algorithms_using_a_variable_forgetting_factor","3029952_The_overdetermined_recursive_instrumental_variable_method","3029727_Optimal_instrumental_variable_estimation_and_approximate_implementations","3020284_The_Square-root_Overparameterized_Recursive_Instrumental_Variable_Algorithm","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation","3011362_A_subspace-tracking_approach_to_interference_nulling_for_phased_array-based_radio_telescopes"]}
