{"id":"320219036_A_Comparison_Among_Deterministic_Packet-Dropouts_Models_in_Networked_Control_Systems","abstract":"Several papers have studied networked control systems in the presence of packet dropouts. One can distinguish between deterministic and stochastic packet-dropout models, the former being particularly suited when packet dropouts are of a malicious nature. This letter aims at linking and comparing a number of deterministic packet-dropout models.","authors":["Claudio De Persis","Pietro Tesi"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Control Systems Letters 2(1):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCSYS.2017.2759423","Project: Control of cyber-physical systems"],"references":["275588315_Self-triggered_Coordination_over_a_Shared_Network_under_Denial-of-Service","261490436_An_introduction_to_event-triggered_and_self-triggered_control","253563412_Stability_and_persistent_disturbance_attenuation_properties_for_a_class_of_networked_control_systems_Switched_system_approach","225075773_State_Feedback_Controller_Design_of_Networked_Control_Systems","224220545_Optimal_Control_in_the_Presence_of_an_Intelligent_Jammer_with_Limited_Actions","224198940_Input-to-State_Stability_of_Packetized_Predictive_Control_Over_Unreliable_Networks_Affected_by_Packet-Dropouts","221422380_Safe_and_Secure_Networked_Control_Systems_under_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","220031311_The_Feasibility_of_Launching_and_Detecting_Jamming_Attacks_in_Wireless_Networks","4120468_State_feedback_controller_design_of_networked_control_systems","3841999_Control_of_Asynchronous_Dynamical_Systems_with_Rate_Constraints_on_Events","3206709_Stability_of_networked_control_systems_IEEE_Control_Syst_Mag_21_84-99","2998161_A_Survey_of_Recent_Results_in_Networked_Control_Systems","308766476_Networked_control_of_nonlinear_systems_under_Denial-of-Service","306269343_Sampled-Data_Consensus_of_Linear_Multi-agent_Systems_With_Packet_Losses","304410838_Self-triggered_coordination_over_a_shared_network_under_Denial-of-Service","277607377_Input-to-State_Stabilizing_Control_Under_Denial-of-Service","276521035_Optimal_Denial-of-Service_Attack_Scheduling_With_Energy_Constraint","262371411_Intelligent_jamming_in_wireless_networks_with_applications_to_80211b_and_other_networks","226326695_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Networked_Control_Systems","224626904_Designing_observer-based_controller_for_network_control_system","224098496_Stabilization_of_Sampled-Data_Control_Systems_With_Control_Inputs_Missing","221233332_Medium_Access_Control_for_Adversarial_Channels_with_Jamming","3842252_Stability_of_Switched_Systems_with_Average_Dwell-Time"]}
