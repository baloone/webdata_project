{"id":"333088919_Comparative_Analysis_of_Eleven_Healthcare-Associated_Outbreaks_of_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_Mers-Cov_from_2015_to_2017","abstract":"Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015–2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age ≥65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6–8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3–5.7) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01–0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcare-associated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.","authors":["Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin","Birgit Nikolay","Abdullah M Assiri","Abdul Aziz Bin Saeed"],"meta":["May 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-43586-9","Project: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus - Saudi Arabia"],"references":["327713120_MERS_Progress_on_the_global_response_remaining_challenges_and_the_way_forward","324531950_Asymptomatic_infection_of_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_using_serologic_survey_in_Korea","317335433_Identified_Transmission_Dynamics_of_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_Infection_During_an_Outbreak_Implications_of_an_Overcrowded_Emergency_Department","311319570_Case_characteristics_among_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_outbreak_and_non-outbreak_cases_in_Saudi_Arabia_from_2012_to_2015","330024527_Scope_and_extent_of_healthcare-associated_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_transmission_during_two_contemporaneous_outbreaks_in_Riyadh_Saudi_Arabia_2017","320017292_High_reproduction_number_of_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_in_nosocomial_outbreaks_Mathematical_modelling_in_Saudi_Arabia_and_South_Korea","318571812_Outbreak_of_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome-Coronavirus_Causes_High_Fatality_After_Cardiac_Operations","313507025_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome","313484768_Outcome_of_strict_implementation_of_infection_prevention_control_measures_during_an_outbreak_of_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome","311613198_Risk_Factors_for_Transmission_of_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_Infection_During_the_2015_Outbreak_in_South_Korea"]}
