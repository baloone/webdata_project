Due to this necessity, a method has been composed for representing a given set of numerical data on a pair of variables by a polynomial curve. The method has been composed with the help of elementary column transformation of matrix. This paper describes the method composed here with numerical example in order to show the application of the method to numerical data.\nKeywords","authors":["Biswajit Das","Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["February 2017","DOI:10.14445/22315373/IJMTT-V42P507","Project: No project"],"references":["322959250_Matrix_Inversion_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322937252_Inversion_of_Matrix_by_Elementary_Transformation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797744_Newton's_Forward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797649_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","308576265_Newton's_Divided_Difference_Interpolation_formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","307867699_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","315232371_Recurrence_relations_for_computing_with_modified_divided_differences","273772771_On_Interpolation_II_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Fundamental_Points_of_Lagrange_and_Hermite_Interpolation","272695344_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","268989954_An_introduction_to_analysis_by_Lagrange_interpolation"]}
