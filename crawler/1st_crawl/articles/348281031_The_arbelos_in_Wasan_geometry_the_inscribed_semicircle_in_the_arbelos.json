{"id":"348281031_The_arbelos_in_Wasan_geometry_the_inscribed_semicircle_in_the_arbelos","abstract":"We define an inscribed semicircle in the arbelos, and consider two problems in Wasan geometry, one of which involves an inscribed semicircle in the arbelos. We show that an inscribed semicircle in the arbelos is uniquely determined with its construction and show several properties of it. We also consider three semicircles congruent to the inscribed semicircle in the arbelos and several Archimedean circles.","authors":["Hiroshi Okumura"],"meta":["January 2021","Projects: Division by zeroarbelosWasan Geometry"],"references":["329210266_Wasan_Geometry_and_Division_by_Zero_Calculus","323153952_Remarks_for_The_Twin_Circles_of_Archimedes_in_a_Skewed_Arbelos_by_Okumura_and_Watanabe","228491307_The_twin_circles_of_Archimedes_in_a_skewed_arbelos","265374005_Are_the_Twin_Circles_of_Archimedes_Really_Twins"]}
