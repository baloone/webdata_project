{"id":"288485134_An_energy_efficient_clustering_algorithm_for_MANETs","abstract":"This paper describes a routing system for a communication network constituted by several ad hoc mobile nodes. This system optimizes energy consumption. It divides the network into clusters. Thereafter it detects the best way in terms of energy to be taken by a stream of data. This consists to calculate the energy required for each available path and select the optimal gateways. Each cluster is identified by a cluster-head which is elected according to its position and its residual energy by using a clustering algorithm. The main objective of this paper is to optimize the number of live nodes by assigning to each network task the appropriate nodes.","authors":["Ali Choukri","Ahmed Habbani","Mohamed el Koutbi"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICMCS.2014.6911232","Conference: 2014 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems (ICMCS)"],"references":["260670859_A_Survey_of_Energy-Efficient_Wireless_Communications","258395857_Efficient_Heuristic_Based_on_Clustering_Approach_for_OLSR","228845446_Wireless_and_Mobile_Networks","224372726_EE-OLSR_Energy_efficient_OLSR_routing_protocol_for_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","220360297_A_Survey_of_Clustering_Ensemble_Algorithms","3895235_A_Mobility_Based_Metric_for_Clustering_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","289222977_A_hierarchical_version_of_OLSR_for_MANET","286077497_WLANs_Medium_Access_Control","260671137_Energy-Efficient_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","248502703_Connected_Domination_in_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","220195503_PAMAS_-_Power_Aware_Multi-Access_protocol_with_Signalling_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","4036974_3hBAC_3-hop_between_adjacent_clusterheads_a_novel_non-overlapping_clustering_algorithm_for_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","3968618_STEM_Topology_management_for_energy_efficient_sensor_networks","3904823_Minimum-energy_mobile_wireless_networks_revisited","3819565_Distributed_and_mobility-adaptive_clustering_for_multimedia_support_in_multi-hop_wireless_networks","3808004_Distributed_Clustering_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2997664_A_Design_Concept_for_Reliable_Mobile_Radio_Networks_with_Frequency_Hopping_Signaling","2862543_K-Clustering_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2449222_Clustering_and_Routing_in_Mobile_Wireless_Networks","2367993_Geography-informed_Energy_Conservation_for_Ad_Hoc_Routing","2285981_Multicluster_Mobile_Multimedia_Radio_Network"]}
