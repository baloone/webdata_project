{"id":"327212977_The_Hidden_Image_of_Mobile_Apps_Geographic_Demographic_and_Cultural_Factors_in_Mobile_Usage","abstract":"While mobile apps have become an integral part of everyday life, little is known about the factors that govern their usage. Particularly the role of geographic and cultural factors has been understudied. This article contributes by carrying out a large-scale analysis of geographic, cultural, and demographic factors in mobile usage. We consider app usage gathered from 25,323 Android users from 44 countries and 54,776 apps in 55 categories, and demographics information collected through a user survey. Our analysis reveals significant differences in app category usage across countries and we show that these differences, to large degree, reflect geographic boundaries. We also demonstrate that country gives more information about application usage than any demographic, but that there also are geographic and socio-economic subgroups in the data. Finally, we demonstrate that app usage correlates with cultural values using the Value Survey Model of Hofstede as a reference of cross-cultural differences.","authors":["Ella Peltonen","Eemil Lagerspetz","Jonatan Hamberg","Abhinav Mehrotra"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1145/3229434.3229474","Conference: the 20th International Conference"],"references":["318069210_A_Large-Scale_Long-Term_Analysis_of_Mobile_Device_Usage_Characteristics","311222778_Sovereignty_of_the_Apps_There's_more_to_Relevance_than_Downloads","308048936_Discovering_different_kinds_of_smartphone_users_through_their_application_usage_behaviors","280497078_Comparison_of_self-administered_survey_questionnaire_responses_collected_using_mobile_apps_versus_other_methods","266030387_Investigating_Country_Differences_in_Mobile_App_User_Behavior_and_Challenges_for_Software_Engineering","263090340_Contextual_Experience_Sampling_of_Mobile_Application_Micro-Usage","262312667_Rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apps_A_systematic_study_of_the_mobile_app_ecosystem","261369098_You_are_What_you_Eat_and_Drink_Identifying_Cultural_Boundaries_by_Analyzing_Food_Drink_Habits_in_Foursquare","260833496_How_Social_are_Social_Media_A_Cross-Cultural_Comparison_of_Online_Purchase_Decision_Influences","258144012_Cultural_Differences_and_Switching_of_In-Group_Sharing_Behavior_Between_an_American_Facebook_and_a_Chinese_Renren_Social_Networking_Site","254002853_Identifying_diverse_usage_behaviors_of_smartphone_apps","247717730_Hofstede's_Model_of_National_Cultural_Differences_and_their_Consequences_A_Triumph_of_Faith_-_a_Failure_of_Analysis","221270571_Falling_asleep_with_Angry_Birds_Facebook_and_Kindle_A_large_scale_study_on_mobile_application_usage","221234363_Diversity_in_Smartphone_Usage","220586519_My_App_is_an_Experiment_Experience_from_User_Studies_in_Mobile_App_Stores","201382128_Clustering_Countries_on_Attitudinal_Dimensions_A_Review_and_Synthesis","5223196_A_Quarter_Century_of_Culture's_Consequences_A_Review_of_Empirical_Research_Incorporating_Hofstede's_Cultural_Values_Framework","315632980_App_Miscategorization_Detection_A_Case_Study_on_Google_Play","310820331_Learning_from_the_ubiquitous_language_an_empirical_analysis_of_emoji_usage_of_smartphone_users","283104387_Energy_modeling_of_system_settings_A_crowdsourced_approach","277307432_Understanding_the_Challenges_of_Mobile_Phone_Usage_Data","268818948_Cultures_and_Organizations_Software_of_the_Mind","266654790_Carat_collaborative_energy_diagnosis_for_mobile_devices","266653537_Doodle_around_the_world_Online_scheduling_behavior_reflects_cultural_differences_in_time_perception_and_group_decision-making","262167039_How_Carat_affects_user_behavior_Implications_for_mobile_battery_awareness_applications","261858477_Exploring_iPhone_usage_the_influence_of_socioeconomic_differences_on_smartphone_adoption_usage_and_usability","261563766_Mobile_communication_for_human_needs_A_comparison_of_smartphone_use_between_the_US_and_Korea","247723478_Work-Related_Values_of_ManagersA_Test_of_the_Hofstede_Model","247612380_Does_national_culture_influence_consumers'_evaluation_of_trvel_services_A_test_of_Hofstede's_model_of_cross-cultural_differences","230557580_Culture's_Consequences_Comparing_Values_Behaviors_Institutions_and_Organizations_Across_Nations","223496679_Analysis_of_Users_and_Non-Users_of_Smartphone_Applications","222513274_Cultural_Clusters_Methodology_and_Findings","221513902_Transnational_HCI_humans_computers_and_interactions_in_transnational_contexts","220300463_An_international_study_of_smartphone_usage","31737447_Scale_Development_Theory_and_Applications_RF_DeVellis","31710711_Culture_Consequences_Comparing_Values_Behaviors_Institutions_and_Organizations_Across_Nations_G_Hofstede","5149310_Social_Desirability_Response_Bias_Gender_and_Factors_Influencing_Organizational_Commitment_An_International_Study","3076661_Dimensions_of_national_culture_and_corporate_adoption_of_IT_infrastructure"]}
