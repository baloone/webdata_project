{"id":"277434875_Individual_characteristics_associated_with_World_Wide_Web_use","abstract":"This study examines the influence of the individual characteristic of playfulness on the use of the World Wide Web (WWW). Previous research suggests that microcomputer playfulness has an effect on computer usage in general, and we found support for a similar relationship in WWW use. Two samples of students were surveyed in this study; one consisting of undergraduate students and the other comprised of graduate students. Our findings also suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect WWW use differentially for entertainment purposes and for course work purposes. Our study confirms previous research in that we found that ability to use the computer has a positive effect on WWW usage.","authors":["MaryAnne Atkinson","Christine Kydd"],"meta":["April 1997Data Base for Advances in Information Systems 28(2):53-62","DOI:10.1145/264701.264705"],"references":["232454636_Playfulness_Definition_design_and_measurement","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","223338692_The_effects_of_individual_differences_and_goal_origin_on_the_goal_setting_process","20432305_Optimal_Experience_in_Work_and_Leisure","278936402_The_Adult_Playfulness_Scale_An_Initial_Assessment","274752517_Refining_the_Nomological_Net_of_the_Adult_Playfulness_Scale_Personality_Motivational_and_Attitudinal_Correlates_for_Highly_Intelligent_Adults","242476180_Alternative_Measures_of_System_Effectiveness_Associations_and_Implications","238999992_Organizational_Characteristics_and_MIS_Success_in_the_Context_of_Small_Business","227867445_Effects_of_feedback_and_playfulness_on_performance_in_microcomputer_software_training","223648878_Microcomputer_applications_An_empirical_look_at_usage","222234808_The_dimensionality_and_correlates_of_flow_in_human-computer_interactions","222234210_Correlates_of_user_satisfaction_with_end_user_computing_An_exploratory_study","222061811_User_acceptance_of_microcomputer_technology_An_empirical_test","220260365_Microcomputer_Playfulness_Developing_a_Measure_With_Workplace_Implications","220259955_Perceived_Usefulness_Ease_of_Use_and_Usage_of_Information_Technology_A_Replication"]}
