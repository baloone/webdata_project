{"id":"337427472_A_value_for_games_on_colored_communication_structures","abstract":"Colored graphs have been used in many areas of technological research such as computer science, multiprocessor systems, network topology, etc. Normally, the term colored graph is used in a graph where its nodes have been colored. However, we work with edge colored graphs, where the ones that have been colored are the edges. The main aim of this paper is to determine a way based on cooperative game theory to measure the importance of the nodes in a network using edge colored graphs.","authors":["Manuel Ordoñez","Andrés Jiménez-Losada","Julio R.
