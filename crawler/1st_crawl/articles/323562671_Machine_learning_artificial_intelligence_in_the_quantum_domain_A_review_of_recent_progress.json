{"id":"323562671_Machine_learning_artificial_intelligence_in_the_quantum_domain_A_review_of_recent_progress","abstract":"Quantum information technologies, on the one side, and intelligent learning\nsystems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a\ntransforming impact on our society in the future.\nThe respective underlying fields of basic research -- quantum information (QI) versus\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)\n-- have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been\ninvestigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work,\nresearchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can indeed\nlearn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum\ncomputing and machine learning, investigating how results and techniques from one\nfield can be used to solve the problems of the other. In recent time, we have\nwitnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance,\nquantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for machine\nlearning problems, critical in our ``big data'' world. Conversely, machine learning\nalready permeates many cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in\nadvanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or\nclassical machine learning optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum\nenhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning\ntasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally,\nworks exploring the use of artificial intelligence for the very design of quantum\nexperiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have\nreported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement -- exploring what\nML/AI can do for quantum physics, and vice versa -- researchers have also broached\nthe fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This\ndeals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world\nthat is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main\nideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research\ninvestigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.","authors":["Vedran Dunjko","Hans J Briegel"],"meta":["March 2018Reports on Progress in Physics 81(7)","DOI:10.1088/1361-6633/aab406"],"references":["323400119_Neural-network_quantum_state_tomography","321571298_Mastering_Chess_and_Shogi_by_Self-Play_with_a_General_Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithm","321416021_Quantum-Assisted_Learning_of_Hardware-Embedded_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models","320920080_QVECTOR_an_algorithm_for_device-tailored_quantum_error_correction","320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","320344790_Neural-Network_Quantum_States_String-Bond_States_and_Chiral_Topological_States","319415972_Opportunities_and_challenges_for_quantum-assisted_machine_learning_in_near-term_quantum_computers","319391535_Quantum-Enhanced_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Finite-Episode_Games_with_Discrete_State_Spaces","319101364_Unsupervised_machine_learning_account_of_magnetic_transitions_in_the_Hubbard_model","318721159_Quantum_machine_learning_A_classical_perspective","317496930_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification_A_Comprehensive_Review","317356508_Active_learning_machine_learns_to_create_new_quantum_experiments","317189074_Deep_Neural_Network_Probabilistic_Decoder_for_Stabilizer_Codes","317062372_Machine-learning-assisted_correction_of_correlated_qubit_errors_in_a_topological_code","316908137_Inductive_Supervised_Quantum_Learning","316643067_Decoding_Small_Surface_Codes_with_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","316642972_Transforming_Bell's_Inequalities_into_State_Classifiers_with_Machine_Learning","316617967_Machine_Learning_Meets_Quantum_State_Preparation_The_Phase_Diagram_of_Quantum_Control","315748866_Quantum_machine_learning_with_small-scale_devices_Implementing_a_distance-based_classifier_with_a_quantum_interference_circuit","315006561_Why_and_when_can_deep-but_not_shallow-networks_avoid_the_curse_of_dimensionality_A_review","313642568_Quantum_Sampling_Problems_BosonSampling_and_Quantum_Supremacy","312521292_Basic_protocols_in_quantum_reinforcement_learning_with_superconducting_circuits","312521096_Quantum_Entanglement_in_Neural_Network_States","312520979_Efficient_Representation_of_Quantum_Many-body_States_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","311106667_Common_Foundations_of_Optimal_Control_Across_the_Sciences_evidence_of_a_free_lunch","311067084_Quantum_Machine_Learning","310953357_Quantum_Enhanced_Inference_in_Markov_Logic_Networks","308913060_Achieving_quantum_supremacy_with_sparse_and_noisy_commuting_quantum_computations","344126771_On_quantum_neural_computing","329648508_The_Soar_Cognitive_Architecture","322092199_Ising_formulation_of_associative_memory_models_and_quantum_annealing_recall","321448298_Implementing_a_distance-based_classifier_with_a_quantum_interference_circuit","321067379_Quantum_Speed-Ups_for_Solving_Semidefinite_Programs","321066451_Quantum_SDP-Solvers_Better_Upper_and_Lower_Bounds","320296757_Exponential_Quantum_Speed-ups_for_Semidefinite_Programming_with_Applications_to_Quantum_Learning","319576242_Autonomous_robots_potential_advances_and_future_direction","319209701_A_Brief_Survey_of_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","318824536_Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_regression","318071764_Automatic_generation_of_optimal_quantum_key_distribution_protocols","316282993_Kernel_methods_for_interpretable_machine_learning_of_order_parameters","316017714_Quantum_gate_learning_in_qubit_networks_Toffoli_gate_without_time-dependent_control","315764884_Discovering_Phases_Phase_Transitions_and_Crossovers_through_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_A_critical_examination","314967659_Experimental_Quantum_Hamiltonian_Learning","314856432_Machine_Learning_in_Medicine_-_a_Complete_Overview","313879422_Designing_Adiabatic_Quantum_Optimization_A_Case_Study_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","312970597_A_proposal_for_the_Dartmouth_summer_research_project_on_artificial_intelligence","312288277_Robotic_playing_for_hierarchical_complex_skill_learning","311253773_A_genetic_algorithm_to_analyze_the_security_of_quantum_cryptographic_protocols","309192035_A_Neural_Decoder_for_Topological_Codes","308964646_Learning_phase_transitions_by_confusion","308391942_Quantum-Enhanced_Machine_Learning","307955088_Machine_Learning_Phases_of_Strongly_Correlated_Fermions","308646556_Google's_Neural_Machine_Translation_System_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Human_and_Machine_Translation","308321044_Quantum_Speed-ups_for_Semidefinite_Programming","307525218_Prediction_by_linear_regression_on_a_quantum_computer"]}
