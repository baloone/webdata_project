{"id":"319489076_Syntactic_complexity_of_suffix-free_languages","abstract":"We solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a suffix-free language with n left quotients (that is, with state complexity n) is at most (n-1)n-2+n-2 for n≥6. Since this bound is known to be reachable, this settles the problem. We also reduce the alphabet of the witness languages reaching this bound to five letters instead of n+2, and show that it cannot be any smaller. Finally, we prove that the transition semigroup of a minimal deterministic automaton accepting a witness language is unique for each n.","authors":["Janusz Brzozowski","Marek Szykuła"],"meta":["September 2017Information and Computation 259","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2017.08.014"],"references":["275279897_Complexity_of_Suffix-Free_Regular_Languages","242378722_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","225130243_State_Complexity_and_the_Monoid_of_Transformations_of_a_Finite_Set","222837216_State_complexity_of_basic_operations_on_suffix-free_regular_languages","220520656_State_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","220123109_Languages_Convex_with_Respect_to_Binary_Relations_and_Their_Closure_Properties","50378581_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Prefix-_Suffix-_Bifix-_and_Factor-FreeRegular_Languages","47438215_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Ideal_and_Closed_Languages","41055007_Quotient_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages"]}
