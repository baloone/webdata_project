{"id":"302972516_Optimization_models_for_placement_of_an_energy-aware_electric_vehicle_charging_infrastructure","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of optimally placing charging stations in urban areas. Two optimization criteria are used: maximizing the number of reachable households and minimizing overall e-transportation energy cost. The decision making models used for both cases are mixed integer programming with linear and nonlinear energy-aware constraints. A multi-objective optimization model that handles both criteria (number of reachable households and transportation energy) simultaneously is also presented. A number of simulation results are provided for two different cities in order to illustrate the proposed methods. Among other insights, these results show that the multi-objective optimization provides improved placement results.","authors":["Zonggen Yi","Peter H.
