{"id":"30421560_Survey_of_Agent_Based_Modelling_and_Simulation_Tools","abstract":"Agent Based Modelling and Simulation is a computationally demanding technique having itsorigins in discrete event simulation, genetic algorithms and cellular automata. It is a powerful technique for simulating dynamic complex systems and observing \"emergent\" behaviour. There is currently a lot of interest in developing ABMs as a general computational technique applicable to the study of large scale systems. ABMs has been adapted to run on novel architectures such as GPGPU, e.g. nVidia hardware using the CUDA programming language. Argonne National Laboratory have a Web site on Exascale ABMs and have run models on the IBM BlueGene with funding from the SciDAC Programme. The most common uses of ABMs are in social simulation and optimisation problems, such as crowd behaviour, urban simulation, traffic flow and supply chains. We will investigate other uses in computational science, particularly in engineering and systems biology. on-line technical report","authors":["R.J.
