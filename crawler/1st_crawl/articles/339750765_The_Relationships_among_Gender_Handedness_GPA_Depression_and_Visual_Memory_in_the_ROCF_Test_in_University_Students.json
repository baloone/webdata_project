Participants were 66 men and 72 women who\nwere 17-25 years of age. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test developed by Rey and standardized by Osterrieth used\nto screen for visual memory. The Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) 20 adapted from WHO was used to screen for depression.\nHandedness was ascertained by using the Edinburgh Handedness Scale.\nResults: There was a negative correlation between Grade Point Average (GPA) and depression score in men and a positive\ncorrelation in women. Also, there were negative correlations between depression score and short-term and long-term visual\nmemories in the total sample and women, but not in male students. Additionally, women have higher short-term and long-term\nvisual memories in the ROCF test than men in the present study. Also, the left-handed university students had advantages in terms\nof short-term and long-term visual memories (ROCF test) than the right-handed ones.\nDiscussion: A negative in men and a positive in women correlations between GPA and depression score may be related to the\ngender-related differences in depression. High depression score but in its normal range, especially in female university students, is\nan important factor to increase both GPA and short-term and long-term memories. The advantage or superiority of left-handed\nathletes for success and performance or their intrinsic neurological advantage compared to right-handed athletes may result from\ntheir high scores in short-term and long-term visual memories in the ROCF test.\nConclusion: ROCF test can be accepted as an important","authors":["Ochilbek Rakhmanov","Senol Dane"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Research in Medical and Dental Science 8(1):37-42","Project: Research on effects of Cognitive Drawing tests on students academic and psychological conditions"],"references":["333176424_The_Effects_of_Sex_Physical_Defect_on_Body_Acne_on_Face_and_Education_on_Depression_in_Nigerian_University_Students","317481123_Mental_distress_and_associated_factors_among_undergraduate_students_at_the_University_of_Hargeisa_Somaliland_A_cross-sectional_study","262749615_Depression_rating_scales_as_screening_tools_for_depression_in_high_school_students","320882699_Can_visuospatial_measures_improve_the_diagnosis_of_Alzheimer's_disease","312985958_Development_of_the_concept_of_executive_function_and_its_relationship_to_the_frontal_lobes","306535703_Translations_of_excerpts_from_Andre_Rey's_psychological_examination_of_traumatic_encephalopathy_and_PA_Osterrieth's_the_complex_figure_copy_test","286780791_Organizational_strategies_and_nonverbal_memory_in_obsessive-compulsive_disorder","285077550_Le_test_de_copie_d'une_figure_complex_Contribution_a_l'etude_de_la_perception_et_de_la_memoire","255868738_Lateral_Preferences_and_Human_Behavior","247492815_Rey-Osterrieth_Complex_Figure_performance_in_healthy_older_adults_Relationship_to_age_education_sex_and_IQ"]}
