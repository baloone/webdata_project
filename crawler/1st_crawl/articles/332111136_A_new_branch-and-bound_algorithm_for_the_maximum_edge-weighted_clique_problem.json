{"id":"332111136_A_new_branch-and-bound_algorithm_for_the_maximum_edge-weighted_clique_problem","abstract":"We study the maximum edge-weighted clique problem, a problem related to the maximum (vertex-weighted) clique problem which asks for finding a complete subgraph (i.e., a clique) of maximum total weight on its edges.\nThe problem appears in a wide range of applications, including bioinformatics, material science, computer vision, robotics, and many more.\nIn this work, we propose a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the problem which relies on a novel bounding procedure capable of pruning a very large amount of nodes of the branch-and-bound tree.\nExtensive computational experiments on random and structured graphs, encompassing standard benchmarks used in the literature as well as recently introduced real-world large-scale graphs, show that our new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude on many instances.","authors":["Pablo San Segundo","Stefano Coniglio","Fabio Furini","Ivana Ljubic"],"meta":["October 2019European Journal of Operational Research 278(1):76-90","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.047","Project: Exact Maximum Clique"],"references":["326749633_A_Branch-and-Bound_Based_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Edge-Weight_Clique_Problem","323611712_A_nonconvex_quadratic_optimization_approach_to_the_maximum_edge_weight_clique_problem","323150851_The_Maximum_Clique_Interdiction_Problem","322190554_Incremental_Upper_Bound_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","330961571_An_exact_algorithm_for_the_maximum_quasi-clique_problem","325060256_Finding_clique_clusters_with_the_highest_betweenness_centrality","323889599_A_new_upper_bound_for_the_maximum_weight_clique_problem","321637269_The_Maximum_Edge_Weight_Clique_Problem_Formulations_and_Solution_Approaches","320827523_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Problem_in_Large_Graphs","314033019_On_Minimization_of_the_Number_of_Branches_in_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem"]}
