{"id":"320885186_CSI_A_Hybrid_Deep_Model_for_Fake_News_Detection","abstract":"The topic of fake news has drawn attention both from the public and the academic communities. Such misinformation has the potential of affecting public opinion, providing an opportunity for malicious parties to manipulate the outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which has limited their success and generality.\nIn this work, we propose a model that combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news. Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not. Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations of both users and articles.","authors":["Natali Ruchansky","Sungyong Seo","Yan Liu"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3132847.3132877","Conference: the 2017 ACM"],"references":["314433388_Online_Human-Bot_Interactions_Detection_Estimation_and_Characterization","312367197_Rumor_Detection_over_Varying_Time_Windows","308021270_DeBot_Twitter_Bot_Detection_via_Warped_Correlation","305334381_Sequential_Short-Text_Classification_with_Recurrent_and_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","303545807_Emergent_a_novel_data-set_for_stance_classification","303015763_Detecting_Rumors_from_Microblogs_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","299943097_Disinformation_on_the_Web_Impact_Characteristics_and_Detection_of_Wikipedia_Hoaxes","283721117_Misleading_Online_Content_Recognizing_Clickbait_as_False_News","281818851_Deception_Detection_for_News_Three_Types_of_Fakes","280929880_Detect_Rumors_Using_Time_Series_of_Social_Context_Information_on_Microblogging_Websites","278703799_TweetCred_Real-Time_Credibility_Assessment_of_Content_on_Twitter","266629432_Rumors_False_Flags_and_Digital_Vigilantes_Misinformation_on_Twitter_After_the_2013_Boston_Marathon_Bombing","265018073_Linguistic_Traces_of_a_Scientific_Fraud_The_Case_of_Diederik_Stapel","262354540_Epidemiological_Modeling_of_News_and_Rumors_on_Twitter","237053772_Characterizing_the_Life_Cycle_of_Online_News_Stories_Using_Social_Media_Reactions","235765864_One-Class_Support_Measure_Machines_for_Group_Anomaly_Detection","228519018_Spotting_Fake_Reviewer_Groups_in_Consumer_Reviews","222095615_Identifying_Infection_Sources_and_Regions_in_Large_Networks","221023878_Information_credibility_on_Twitter","220846842_Social_spam_detection","7276503_A_systematic_comparison_and_evaluation_of_biclustering_methods_for_gene_expression_data","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","308565786_Deception_detection_for_news_Three_types_of_fakes","307858255_Deception_Detection_and_Rumor_Debunking_for_Social_Media","305510282_GLAD_Group_Anomaly_Detection_in_Social_Media_Analysis","305067383_Enquiring_Minds_Early_Detection_of_Rumors_in_Social_Media_from_Enquiry_Posts","301404842_A_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Model_for_Answer_Sentence_Selection_in_Question_Answering","291557996_Suspicious_Behavior_Detection_Current_Trends_and_Future_Directions","290363099_Mining_of_massive_datasets_Second_edition","287571835_Rumor_cascades","282931284_False_rumors_detection_on_Sina_Weibo_by_propagation_structures","280113442_Mining_of_Massive_Datasets","274477438_Rumor_source_detection_with_multiple_observations","267562091_Group_Anomaly_Detection_using_Flexible_Genre_Models","266657082_Rumor_source_detection_with_multiple_observations_fundamental_limits_and_algorithms","262416109_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_and_Documents","262251490_CopyCatch_Stopping_group_attacks_by_spotting_lockstep_behavior_in_social_networks","228059292_Information_Source_Detection_in_the_SIR_Model_A_Sample_Path_BasedApproach","222412711_Recurrent_neural_networks_for_time_series_classification","220320416_Hierarchical_Probabilistic_Models_for_Group_Anomaly_Detection"]}
