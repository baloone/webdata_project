{"id":"285152964_On_the_Conceptualization_of_Information_Systems_as_Socio-Technical_Phenomena_in_Simulation-Based_Research","abstract":"Information Systems (IS) are specified as complex socio-technical systems that display dynamic and emergent behaviors. Simulation-based studies provide a useful tool for analyzing such systems; however, the current presence and impact of simulation-based IS studies is limited. The socio-technical interactions and inherent dynamics of information systems make the development of IS simulations attractive, but challenging. Building simulations in this context requires both accurate conceptualizations of the underlying socio-technical systems as well as a sound transfer of these conceptualizations into simulation models. This study proposes an analysis framework that conjointly captures both the socio-technical system models as well as the derived simulation models. This allows for a critical assessment of the status quo of the extant simulation-based IS research. The identified relations are analyzed and seven propositions are derived, which provide guidance for prospective simulation-based research.","authors":["Jannis Beese","Kazem Haki","Stephan Aier"],"meta":["December 2015","Conference: 2015 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS 2015)At: Fort Worth, TX","Project: Architectural Thinking"],"references":["288520753_Life_in_the_network_The_coming_age_of_computational_social_science","287623940_Modeling_the_evolution_of_generativity_and_the_emergence_of_digital_ecosystems","268386888_Emergence_of_Power_Laws_in_Online_Communities_The_Role_of_Social_Mechanisms_and_Preferential_Attachment","333493027_Model-Centered_Organization_Science_Epistemology","297544881_Agent-Based_Modeling_vs_Equation-Based_Modeling_A_Case_Study_and_User'_Guide","287762758_Rethinking_the_value_of_simulation_methods_in_the_information_systems_research_field_A_call_for_reconstructing_contribution_for_a_broader_audience","287227593_Simulation_research_methods'_Companion_to_Organizations","271883593_Applications_of_agent-based_models_for_optimization_problems_A_literature_review","271274838_A_Framework_for_Model_Integration_and_Holistic_Modelling_of_Socio-Technical_Systems","264089815_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Existing_IS_Change_Theories_for_the_Case_of_IOIS_Evolution"]}
