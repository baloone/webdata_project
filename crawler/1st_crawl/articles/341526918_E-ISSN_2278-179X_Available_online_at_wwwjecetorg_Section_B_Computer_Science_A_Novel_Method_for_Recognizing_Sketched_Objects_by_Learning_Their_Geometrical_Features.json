Sketch recognition aims to classify hand-drawn sketches by machines into known categories. This is currently important, particularly because of recent advances in human computer interactions via portable devices. In this paper, we present and explain a novel method for recognizing sketched object by learning a specific set of geometrical features, and creating a classification for these objects. Our proposed method is divided into three steps: extracting the geometrical features from a sketched shape; learning the geometrical features; then finally recognizing the sketched object by building a knowledgebase containing the recognized objects with their geometrical features.","authors":["Mahmoud M Abdelhamied","Yasser Abd El-Latif","Ahmed M.
