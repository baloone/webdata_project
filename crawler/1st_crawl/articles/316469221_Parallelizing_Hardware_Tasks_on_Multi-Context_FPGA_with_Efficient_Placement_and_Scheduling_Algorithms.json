{"id":"316469221_Parallelizing_Hardware_Tasks_on_Multi-Context_FPGA_with_Efficient_Placement_and_Scheduling_Algorithms","abstract":"Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are often used to accelerate multiple tasks simultaneously, working in a tightly coupled processor-coprocessor architecture. Recently, with the fast development of emerging memory technologies, multi-context FPGAs with high-density memories that support fast dynamic reconfiguration have become feasible. Compared with single-context FPGAs, multi-context FPGAs have a much higher on-chip configuration memory capacity but have not been thoroughly investigated to exploit their capabilities. In this work, we investigate how to best utilize the capacity advantage of the multi-context FPGAs.We first propose a static placement strategy to place the requested hardware tasks with minimal area on the FPGA. We then optimize the running time of the static placement without sacrificing its solution quality. Along with the static placement, we propose collaborated online placement and scheduling strategies to manage the actual execution and reconfiguration of hardware tasks on a multi-context FPGA. Our experiments show that the static placement algorithm generates high quality placement solutions within a short time. Starting from the static placement solution, our collaborated online placer and scheduler schedules and places simultaneous acceleration tasks and reduces the acceleration task rejection rate significantly compared to a baseline design.","authors":["Hao Liang","Sharad Sinha","Wei Zhang"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCAD.2017.2697952"],"references":["301690832_A_Quantitative_Analysis_on_Microarchitectures_of_Modern_CPU-FPGA_Platforms","283877317_Integrating_FPGA-based_processing_elements_into_a_runtime_for_parallel_heterogeneous_computing","283307095_Static_hardware_task_placement_on_multi-context_FPGA_using_hybrid_genetic_algorithm","271481765_A_Reconfigurable_Fabric_For_Accelerating_Large-Scale_Datacenter_Services","264082280_The_LEAP_FPGA_operating_system","224098209_A_novel_fast_online_placement_algorithm_on_2D_partially_reconfigurable_devices","220914958_ATB_Area-Time_response_Balancing_algorithm_for_scheduling_real-time_hardware_tasks","220914839_A_novel_online_hardware_task_scheduling_and_placement_algorithm_for_3D_partially_reconfigurable_FPGAs","4193042_Zippy_-_A_coarse-grained_reconfigurable_array_with_support_for_hardware_visualization","4115512_DPGA_Utilization_and_Application","4093826_FPGA_placement_and_routing_using_particle_swarm_optimization","4049073_Online_scheduling_and_placement_of_real-time_tasks_to_partially_reconfigurable_devices","3801036_PipeRench_A_Coprocessor_for_Streaming_Multimedia_Acceleration","2670945_MediaBench_A_Tool_for_Evaluating_and_Synthesizing_Multimedia_and_Communications_Systems","309594118_A_reconfigurable_fabric_for_accelerating_large-scale_datacenter_services","286584801_Portable_module_relocation_and_bitstream_compression_for_Xilinx_FPGAs","273394811_A_Fine-Grain_Dynamically_Reconfigurable_Architecture_Aimed_at_Reducing_the_FPGA-ASIC_Gaps","262163090_Thermal-Aware_Task_Scheduling_in_3D_Chip_Multiprocessor_with_Real-Time_Constrained_Workloads","261163282_A_reconfigurable_computing_architecture_using_magnetic_tunneling_junction_memories","225367068_Minimizing_the_runtime_partial_reconfiguration_overheads_in_reconfigurable_systems","221655079_An_EDF_schedulability_test_for_periodic_tasks_on_reconfigurable_hardware_devices","221225104_Configuration_prefetching_techniques_for_partial_reconfigurable_coprocessor_with_relocation_and_defragmentation","221173469_Size-Reconfiguration_Delay_Tradeoffs_for_a_Class_of_DSP_Blocks_in_Multi-mode_Communication_Systems","221061444_An_efficient_algorithm_for_finding_empty_space_for_online_FPGA_placement","221059971_NATURE_A_hybrid_nanotubeCMOS_dynamically_reconfigurable_architecture","220915750_Sequence-pair_based_placement_method_for_hardsoftpre-placed_modules","220607179_Fast_Optical_Reconfiguration_of_a_Nine-Context_DORGA_Using_a_Speed_Adjustment_Control","220365605_A_hybrid_NanoCMOS_dynamically_reconfigurable_system-Part_II","220340048_FPGA_Architecture_Survey_and_Challenges","51156668_Achieving_High_Performance_with_FPGA-Based_Computing","4257317_NanoMap_An_Integrated_Design_Optimization_Flow_for_a_Hybrid_NanotubeCMOS_Dynamically_Reconfigurable_Architecture","4093854_Force-directed_performance-driven_placement_algorithm_for_FPGAs","3810001_An_O-tree_representation_of_non-slicing_floorplan_and_its_applications","3713649_A_time-multiplexed_FPGA","3674803_Module_placement_on_BSG-structure_and_IC_layout_applications","3338079_Run-time_management_of_a_MPSoC_containing_FPGA_fabric_tiles","3337475_The_Chimaera_Reconfigurable_Functional_Unit","3337160_A_temporal_bipartitioning_algorithm_for_dynamically_reconfigurable_FPGAs","2638452_Timing-driven_placement_for_FPGAs","2485352_Runtime_and_Quality_Tradeoffs_in_FPGA_Placement_and_Routing","2404650_Logic_Synthesis_and_Optimization_Benchmarks_User_Guide_Version_30"]}
