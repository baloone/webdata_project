{"id":"222153315_Lucky_labelings_of_graphs","abstract":"Suppose the vertices of a graph G were labeled arbitrarily by positive integers, and let S(v) denote the sum of labels over all neighbors of vertex v. A labeling is lucky if the function S is a proper coloring of G, that is, if we have S(u)≠S(v) whenever u and v are adjacent. The least integer k for which a graph G has a lucky labeling from the set {1,2,…,k} is the lucky number of G, denoted by η(G).Using algebraic methods we prove that η(G)⩽k+1 for every bipartite graph G whose edges can be oriented so that the maximum out-degree of a vertex is at most k. In particular, we get that η(T)⩽2 for every tree T, and η(G)⩽3 for every bipartite planar graph G. By another technique we get a bound for the lucky number in terms of the acyclic chromatic number. This gives in particular that for every planar graph G. Nevertheless we offer a provocative conjecture that η(G)⩽χ(G) for every graph G.","authors":["Sebastian Czerwiński","Jarosław Grytczuk","Wiktor Żelazny"],"meta":["August 2009Information Processing Letters 109(18):1078-1081","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2009.05.011","SourceDBLP","Project: Lonely Runners"],"references":["2827653_A_Dynamic_Survey_of_Graph_Labeling","256720160_12_Conjecture-the_multiplicative_version","256157728_Acyclic_colorings_of_planar_graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","231992373_Combinatorial_Nullstellensatz","226939982_Coloring_and_orientation_of_graphs","222450739_Regular_subgraphs_of_almost_regular_graphs","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220548994_Weight_choosability_of_graphs","220548640_Interval_bigraphs_and_circular_arc_graphs","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions"]}
