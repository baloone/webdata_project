{"id":"273901161_Virtual_Farmers_Training_Realistic_Simulation_with_Amusements_using_Historic_Simulation_and_Game_Storyline","abstract":"In this paper, we present realistic farming trainer for experiencing crop cultivation and livestock breeding simulation. Farming simulation utilizing game experience has been presented by various formats but current researches have not presented balanced farming experience and amusement to users. We achieved both education purpose and entertainment feature by realistic farming trainer using historic simulation and gaming elements. To achieve realistic educational purpose, we implemented realistic farming simulation using historic simulation, which covers last ten years of weather, disease, and other factors. Also, we use storyline with quest design to give amusement to users. Technical details include (1) Crop simulator, (2) Livestock simulator, (3) Weather simulator, (4) Disease and insect simulator, (5) Fertilizer simulator and (6) Business simulator. Experimenting with sample user groups, they can easily learn how to farming and livestock management with amusements.","authors":["Hwan-Soo Yoo","Seong-Whan Kim"],"meta":["May 2014International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering 9(5):121-130","DOI:10.14257/ijmue.2014.9.5.11","Project: Virtual Farmers Training"],"references":["254848565_Formalizing_a_Domain_Specific_Language_Using_SOS_An_Industrial_Case_Study","242530581_Agritainment_3D_Collaborative_Space_for_Training_Agricultural_Experience_with_Entertainment_Elements","321061618_DSLs_In_Action","319394664_MongoDB_The_Definitive_Guide","271428497_A_multi-model_approach_for_sustainable_agriculture_in_the_US_corn_belt","248519903_JSON_The_fat_-_free_alternative_to_XML","235779841_Domain-Specific_Languages","224187648_Nodejs_Using_JavaScript_to_Build_High-Performance_Network_Programs","224113341_Will_NoSQL_databases_live_up_to_their_promise","223585249_Advances_in_farming_systems_analysis_and_intervention"]}
