{"id":"318396764_How_Do_Cultural_and_Institutional_Distance_Affect_China's_OFDI_towards_the_OBOR_Countries","abstract":"In order to examine the impact of cultural and institutional distance on China’s OFDI towards the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) area, the paper selects 28 countries along The Belt and Road. The empirical results using panel data from 2006-2014 indicate that institutional distance is negatively correlated with China’s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). At the same time, cultural distance interacts with bilateral trade, resulting in a “benefit of foreignness” effect.","authors":["Lin Zhang","Zheqian Xu"],"meta":["January 2017Baltic Journal of European Studies 7(1)","DOI:10.1515/bjes-2017-0003"],"references":["317648259_Do_Bilateral_Investment_Treaties_Increase_Foreign_Direct_Investment_to_Developing_Countries","261362993_How_and_why_Norwegian_MNCs_commit_resources_abroad_Beyond_choice_of_entry_mode","228239954_The_Empirics_of_China's_Outward_Direct_Investment","319574270_The_Trade-Off_between_Foreign_Direct_Investments_and_Exports_The_Role_of_Multiple_Dimensions_of_Distance","283952941_Country_institutional_profile_Concept_and_measurement","270156874_Institutional_Distance_and_the_Multinational_Enterprise","238002473_China's_Outward_Foreign_Direct_Investment_Location_Choice_and_Firm_Ownership","228377151_FDI_from_the_South_the_Role_of_Institutional_Distance_and_Natural_Resources","227508660_Institutions_Resources_and_Entry_Strategies_in_Emerging_Economies","227417936_Country-of-Origin_Determinants_of_Foreign_Direct_Investment_in_an_Emerging_Market_The_Case_of_Mexico"]}
