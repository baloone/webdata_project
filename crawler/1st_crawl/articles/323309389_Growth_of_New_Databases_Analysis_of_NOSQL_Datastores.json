{"id":"323309389_Growth_of_New_Databases_Analysis_of_NOSQL_Datastores","abstract":"Relational database management systems (RDMBSs) today are the predominant technology for storing. In the past few years, the \"one size fits all\"-thinking concerning datastores has been questioned by both, science and web affine companies, which has lead to the emergence of a great variety of alternative databases. There has been an enormous growth in the distributed databases area in the last few years, especially with the NOSQL movement. Keeping this as a motivation, this paper aims at giving a systematic overview of DBMS, discusses about the change from traditional file processing to RDS & ends with NOSQL. Also we have focused on the projects dealt by the NOSQL models with their description & we have said about when it is best suitable. Lastly we have listed the compared features of NoSQL & SQL. Further our paper will help researchers to develop new projects by overcoming the drawbacks of existing or work on the existing one & add up features.","authors":["Abhinay B Angadi","Akshata B Angadi","Karuna Gull","David Lee"],"meta":["June 2013"],"references":["221343719_Towards_robust_distributed_systems","328318686_Database_management_system","221257619_Cassandra_structured_storage_system_on_a_P2P_network","220427202_SQL_databases_v_NoSQL_databases"]}
