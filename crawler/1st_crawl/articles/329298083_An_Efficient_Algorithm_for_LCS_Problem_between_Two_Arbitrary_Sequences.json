{"id":"329298083_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_LCS_Problem_between_Two_Arbitrary_Sequences","abstract":"The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic computer science problem. For the essential problem of computing LCS between two arbitrary sequences s1 and s2 , this paper proposes an algorithm taking O(n+r) space and O(r+n2) time, where r is the total number of elements in the set (i,j)|s1[i]=s2[j] . The algorithm can be more efficient than relevant classical algorithms in specific ranges of r .","authors":["Yubo Li"],"meta":["November 2018Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2018(2):1-6","DOI:10.1155/2018/4158071"],"references":["315592844_File_Type_Identification_of_File_Fragments_using_Longest_Common_Subsequence_LCS","311850071_Detecting_Road_Intersections_from_GPS_Traces_Using_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Algorithm","306094111_Using_longest_common_subsequence_and_character_models_to_predict_word_forms","308846160_Tight_Hardness_Results_for_LCS_and_Other_Sequence_Similarity_Measures","281262456_A_Practical_ORloglog_nn_time_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence","277503531_Longest_Common_Subsequences_of_Two_Random_Sequences","268451085_A_Space-Bounded_Anytime_Algorithm_for_the_Multiple_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","259211806_New_tabulation_and_sparse_dynamic_programming_based_techniques_for_sequence_similarity_problems","247004160_On_economical_construction_of_the_transitive_closure_of_an_oriented_graph","243081238_Historical_Note_on_the_Origin_of_the_Normal_Curve_of_Errors","238601409_Quick-MLCS_A_new_algorithm_for_the_multiple_longest_common_subsequence_problem","234799012_Hirschberg_DS_A_Linear_space_algorithm_for_Computing_Maximal_Common_Subsequences_Commun_ACM_186_341-343","226075148_The_longest_common_subsequence_problem_revisited","225936295_The_early_history_of_factorial_function","222795209_A_bit-string_longest-common-subsequence_algorithm"]}
