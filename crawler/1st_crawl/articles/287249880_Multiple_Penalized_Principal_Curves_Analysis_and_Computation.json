{"id":"287249880_Multiple_Penalized_Principal_Curves_Analysis_and_Computation","abstract":"We study the problem of finding the one-dimensional structure in a given data\nset. In other words we consider ways to approximate a given measure (data) by\ncurves. We consider an objective functional whose minimizers are a\nregularization of principal curves and introduce a new functional which allows\nfor multiple curves. We prove the existence of minimizers and establish their\nbasic properties. We develop an efficient algorithm for obtaining (near)\nminimizers of the functional. While both of the functionals used are nonconvex,\nwe argue that enlarging the configuration space to allow for multiple curves\nleads to a simpler energy landscape with fewer undesirable (high-energy) local\nminima. Furthermore we note that the approach proposed is able to find the\none-dimensional structure even for data with considerable amount of noise.","authors":["Slav Kirov","Dejan Slepƒçev"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 59(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-017-0730-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271218536_Cosmic_Web_Reconstruction_through_Density_Ridges_Method_and_Algorithm","301822646_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1_regularized_problems","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","288927245_An_iterative_regularization_method_for_total_variation-based_image_restoration","285599320_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Data_Representation","284040965_Mean_shift_A_robust_approach_toward_feature_space_analysis","284035345_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_by_Locally_Linear_Embedding","276130202_Temporal_ordering_and_registration_of_images_in_studies_of_developmental_dynamics","268226567_Average-distance_problem_for_parameterized_curves","266656532_Gromov-Hausdorff_Approximation_of_Filamentary_Structures_Using_Reeb-Type_Graphs","265295224_Ridge-based_method_for_finding_curvilinear_structures_from_noisy_data","264852865_Data_Skeletonization_via_Reeb_Graphs","263352453_Asymptotic_Theory_for_Density_Ridges","265705447_Properties_of_Minimizers_of_Average-Distance_Problem_via_Discrete_Approximation_of_Measures","265040105_Applications_of_Lagrangian-Based_Alternating_Direction_Methods_and_Connections_to_Split_Bregman"]}
