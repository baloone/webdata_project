{"id":"335247649_A_Systematic_Investigation_of_Replications_in_Computing_Education_Research","abstract":"As the societal demands for application and knowledge in computer science (CS) increase, CS student enrollment keeps growing rapidly around the world. By continuously improving the efficacy of computing education and providing guidelines for learning and teaching practice, computing education research plays a vital role in addressing both educational and societal challenges that emerge from the growth of CS students. Given the significant role of computing education research, it is important to ensure the reliability of studies in this field. The extent to which studies can be replicated in a field is one of the most important standards for reliability. Different fields have paid increasing attention to the replication rates of their studies, but the replication rate of computing education was never systematically studied. To fill this gap, this study investigated the replication rate of computing education between 2009 and 2018. We examined 2,269 published studies from three major conferences and two major journals in computing education, and found that the overall replication rate of computing education was 2.38%. This study demonstrated the need for more replication studies in computing education and discussed how to encourage replication studies through research initiatives and policy making.","authors":["Qiang Hao","David Hamilton Smith","Naitra Iriumi","Michael Tsikerdekis"],"meta":["August 2019ACM Transactions on Computing Education 19(4):1-18","DOI:10.1145/3345328","Project: Computer Science Education"],"references":["326918060_Unravelling_the_Cognition_of_Coding_in_3-to-6-year_Olds_The_development_of_an_assessment_tool_and_the_relation_between_coding_ability_and_cognitive_compiling_of_syntax_in_natural_language","331758111_Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False","326918059_Blackbox_Five_Years_On_An_Evaluation_of_a_Large-scale_Programming_Data_Collection_Project","326918002_Self-Efficacy_Cognitive_Load_and_Emotional_Reactions_in_Collaborative_Algorithms_Labs_-_A_Case_Study","325904666_ITiCSE_working_groups_and_collaboration_in_the_computing_education_community","325901366_Classroom_experience_report_on_jigsaw_learning","325900654_Programming_predicting_student_success_early_in_CS1_a_re-validation_and_replication_study","323331357_Achievement_Goals_in_CS1_Replication_and_Extension","323328687_Reconciling_the_Promise_and_Pragmatics_of_Enhancing_Computing_Pedagogy_with_Data_Science","323328342_A_Study_of_Pair_Programming_Enjoyment_and_Attendance_using_Study_Motivation_and_Strategy_Metrics"]}
