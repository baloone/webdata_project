{"id":"337428201_A_review_of_hierarchical_control_for_building_microgrids","abstract":"Building microgrids have emerged as an advantageous alternative for tackling environmental issues while enhancing the electricity distribution system. However, uncertainties in power generation, electricity prices and power consumption, along with stringent requirements concerning power quality restrain the wider development of building microgrids. This is due to the complexity of designing a reliable and robust energy management system. Within this context, hierarchical control has proved suitable for handling different requirements simultaneously so that it can satisfactorily adapt to building environments. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of the main hierarchical control algorithms for building microgrids is discussed and compared, emphasising their most important strengths and weaknesses. Accordingly, a detailed explanation of the primary, secondary and tertiary levels is presented, highlighting the role of each control layer in adapting building microgrids to current and future electrical grid structures. Finally, some insights for forthcoming building prosumers are outlined, identifying certain barriers when dealing with building microgrid communities.","authors":["Daniela Yamashita","Ionel Vechiu","Jean-Paul Gaubert"],"meta":["November 2019Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 118","DOI:10.1016/j.rser.2019.109523","Project: Hierarchical control for building microgrids (PhD thesis)"],"references":["335292105_A_selective_harmonic_compensation_and_power_control_approach_exploiting_distributed_electronic_converters_in_microgrids","335091516_Energy_Scheduling_of_Community_Microgrid_with_Battery_Cost_using_Particle_Swarm_Optimisation","332433497_A_review_of_performance_of_zero_energy_buildings_and_energy_efficiency_solutions","332412556_Cloud_forecasting_system_for_monitoring_and_alerting_of_energy_use_by_home_appliances","332411940_Achieving_energy_resilience_through_smart_storage_of_solar_electricity_at_dwelling_and_community_level","332224407_A_survey_on_software_defined_networking_enabled_smart_buildings_Architecture_challenges_and_use_cases","332122520_Peer-to-peer_and_community-based_markets_A_comprehensive_review","330342228_Bus_Voltage_Level_Choice_for_Standalone_Residential_DC_Nanogrid","329340632_Modified_adaptive_differential_evolution_based_optimal_operation_and_security_of_AC-DC_microgrid_systems","328909496_Optimal_energy_management_and_control_aspects_of_distributed_microgrid_using_multi-agent_systems"]}
