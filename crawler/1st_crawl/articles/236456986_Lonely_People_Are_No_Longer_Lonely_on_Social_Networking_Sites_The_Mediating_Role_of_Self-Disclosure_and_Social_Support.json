{"id":"236456986_Lonely_People_Are_No_Longer_Lonely_on_Social_Networking_Sites_The_Mediating_Role_of_Self-Disclosure_and_Social_Support","abstract":"Abstract Most previous studies assert the negative effect of loneliness on social life and an individual's well-being when individuals use the Internet. To expand this previous research tradition, the current study proposes a model to test whether loneliness has a direct or indirect effect on well-being when mediated by self-disclosure and social support. The results show that loneliness has a direct negative impact on well-being but a positive effect on self-disclosure. While self-disclosure positively influences social support, self-disclosure has no impact on well-being, and social support positively influences well-being. The results also show a full mediation effect of social support in the self-disclosure to well-being link. The results imply that even if lonely people's well-being is poor, their well-being can be enhanced through the use of SNSs, including self-presentation and social support from their friends.","authors":["Kyung-Tag Lee","Mi-Jin Noh","Dong-Mo Koo"],"meta":["April 2013Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking 16(6)","DOI:10.1089/cyber.2012.0553","SourcePubMed"],"references":["259823204_Social_Network_Sites_Definition_History_and_Scholarship","247482586_Self-Report_in_Organizational_Research","238429842_Preference_for_Online_Social_Interaction_A_Theory_of_Problematic_Internet_Use_and_Psychosocial_Well-Being","233961253_Exchange-specific_self-disclosure_and_personal_selling","227761741_Is_There_Social_Capital_in_a_Social_Network_Site_Facebook_Use_and_College_Students'_Life_Satisfaction_Trust_and_Participation1","226888596_A_Measure_of_Subjective_Happiness_Preliminary_Reliability_and_Construct_Validation","220438224_The_Benefits_of_Facebook_Friends_Social_Capital_and_College_Students'_Use_of_Online_Social_Network_Sites","220438020_Social_Network_Sites_Definition_History_and_Scholarship","220437972_Online_Communication_and_Adolescent_Well-Being_Testing_the_Stimulation_Versus_the_Displacement_Hypothesis","49843871_Mirror_Mirror_on_My_Facebook_Wall_Effects_of_Exposure_to_Facebook_on_Self-Esteem","49715965_The_Relationship_Between_Facebook_and_the_Well-Being_of_Undergraduate_College_Students","49645496_The_Facebook_Paths_to_Happiness_Effects_of_the_Number_of_Facebook_Friends_and_Self-Presentation_on_Subjective_Well-Being","26281071_Loneliness_as_the_Cause_and_the_Effect_of_Problematic_Internet_Use_The_Relationship_between_Internet_Use_and_Psychological_Well-Being","321603874_Self-Disclosure_Theory_Research_and_Therapy","315190633_The_Associations_among_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Relationships_and_Well-being","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","313388071_Subjective_wellbeing","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","284041695_Self-Report_in_Organisational_Research_Problems_and_Prospects","272965487_Loneliness_A_Source-Book_of_Current_Theory_Research_and_Therapy","271697021_Influences_on_the_Life_Satisfaction_of_Never-Married_Men_and_Women","257253038_The_effects_of_personality_traits_self-esteem_loneliness_and_narcissism_on_Facebook_use_among_university_students","248068445_Themes_in_the_Study_of_Self-Disclosure","247751739_Sociability_Interpersonal_Relations_and_the_Internet_Reconciling_Conflicting_Findings","245073870_A_Social_Technology_That_Reduces_Social_Involvement_and_Psychological_Well-Being","242451778_Internet_paradox_a_social_technology_that_reduces_social_involvement_and_psychological_well-being_american_psychologist","241644960_Social_Consequences_of_the_Internet_for_Adolescents_A_Decade_of_Research","241517272_Relationship_Formation_on_the_Internet_What's_the_Big_Attraction","237202324_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_With_Unobservable_Variable_Sand_Measurement_Error","237009923_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_A_Global_Perspective","235932894_Principles_And_Practice_Of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","235044265_The_Development_of_Interpersonal_Relationships_Social_Penetration_Processes","232520108_Social_penetration_The_development_of_interpersonal_relationships","232446967_Conceptualization_and_measurement_of_reported_self-disclosure","229068013_Machines_and_Mindlessness_Social_Responses_to_Computers","228003128_Internet_Paradox_Revisited","223337034_A_cognitive_-_behavioral_model_of_pathological_Internet_use_PIU","222901182_Incidence_and_Correlates_of_Pathological_Internet_Use_Among_College_Students","222572601_Peer_influence_groups_Identifying_dense_clusters_in_large_networks","222565995_Loneliness_and_Internet_Use","220534922_Common_Method_Variance_in_IS_Research_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Approaches_and_a_Reanalysis_of_Past_Research","51588056_The_Development_of_the_2-Way_Social_Support_Scale_A_Measure_of_Giving_and_Receiving_Emotional_and_Instrumental_Support","47447506_Converting_Virtual_Community_Members_Into_Online_Buyers","45280526_Use_of_Social-Networking_Sites_and_Subjective_Well-Being_A_Study_in_South_Korea","44682036_The_Associations_among_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Relationships_and_Well-being","44654114_Self-Disclosure_through_Weblogs_and_Perceptions_of_Online_and_Real-life_Friendships_among_Female_Bloggers","40499207_The_Single_Consumer","24099036_Intimate_Exchanges_Using_Computers_to_Elicit_Self-Disclosure_From_Consumers","23767668_Can_Blogging_Enhance_Subjective_Well-Being_Through_Self-Disclosure","23653056_Loneliness_Depression_and_Computer_Self-Efficacy_as_Predictors_of_Problematic_Internet_Use"]}
