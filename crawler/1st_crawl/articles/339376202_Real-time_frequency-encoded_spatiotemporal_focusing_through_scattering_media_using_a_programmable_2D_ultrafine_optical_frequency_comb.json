{"id":"339376202_Real-time_frequency-encoded_spatiotemporal_focusing_through_scattering_media_using_a_programmable_2D_ultrafine_optical_frequency_comb","abstract":"Optical wavefront shaping is a powerful tool for controlling photons in strongly scattering media. Its speed, however, has been the bottleneck for in vivo applications. Moreover, unlike spatial focusing, temporal focusing from a continuous-wave source has rarely been exploited yet is highly desired for nonlinear photonics. Here, we present a novel real-time frequency-encoded spatiotemporal (FEST) focusing technology. FEST focusing uses a novel programmable two-dimensional optical frequency comb with an ultrafine linewidth to perform single-shot wavefront measurements, with a fast single-pixel detector. This technique enables simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing at microsecond scales through thick dynamic scattering media. This technology also enabled us to discover the large-scale temporal shift, a new phenomenon that, with the conventional spatial memory effect, establishes a space-time duality. FEST focusing opens a new avenue for high-speed wavefront shaping in the field of photonics.","authors":["Xiaoming Wei","Yuecheng Shen","Joseph C. Jing","Ashton S.
