{"id":"326260296_Functional_Decomposition_for_Software_Architecture_Evolution","abstract":"Software systems need to evolve continuously in order to avoid becoming less useful. However, repeated changes in the software may impede the inner quality of the system. Modularity is considered an important aspect of a good inner quality, and the functional decomposition is an approach that enables to achieve good modularity. Nevertheless, existing approaches for functional decomposition ignore implementation efforts, and this may cause a situation where the required changes are too costly to implement. In this paper we describe an approach to employ functional decomposition for software architecture evolution considering also the implementation efforts.","authors":["David Faitelson","Robert Heinrich","Shmuel Tyszberowicz"],"meta":["July 2018Communications in Computer and Information Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94764-8_16","In book: Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development (pp.377-400)"],"references":["326866543_Maintenance_effort_estimation_with_KAMP4aPS_for_cross-disciplinary_automated_PLC-based_Production_Systems-a_collaborative_approach","317072823_Architecture-Based_Change_Impact_Analysis_in_Information_Systems_and_Business_Processes","315957048_Improving_design_decomposition_extended_version","314522008_Supporting_Software_Architecture_Evolution_by_Functional_Decomposition","313799181_Measuring_Coupling_in_Object-Oriented_Systems","283566310_Improving_Design_Decomposition","329323648_A_guide_to_task_analysis_The_task_analysis_working_group","320496350_Maintenance_effort_estimation_with_KAMP4aPS_for_cross-disciplinary_automated_PLC-based_Production_Systems_-_a_collaborative_approach","315488704_Clustering-Based_Support_for_Software_Architecture_Restructuring","300723112_Architecture-based_Assessment_and_Planning_of_Change_Requests"]}
