{"id":"278124404_Turing_and_the_Serendipitous_Discovery_of_the_Modern_Computer","abstract":"In the centenary year of Turing's birth, a lot of good things are sure to be written about him. But it is hard to find something new to write about Turing. This is the biggest merit of this article: it shows how von Neumann's architecture of the modern computer is a serendipitous consequence of the universal Turing machine, built to solve a logical problem.","authors":["Aurea Anguera de Sojo","Juan Ares","Juan A.
