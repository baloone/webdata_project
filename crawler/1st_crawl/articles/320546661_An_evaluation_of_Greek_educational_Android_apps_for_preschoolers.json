{"id":"320546661_An_evaluation_of_Greek_educational_Android_apps_for_preschoolers","abstract":"Seven years since the introduction of the first tablet (2010-Apple iPad), the use of applications for these devices has increased rapidly and is one of the most hotly-debated topics in the fields of education and child development. However, the increase in popularity of mobile applications does not bring a corresponding increase in the quality of applications as there are contradictory data regarding the appropriateness of the self-proclaimed educational applications for preschoolers. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the self-proclaimed educational applications for Greek preschoolers have been designed in accordance with developmentally appropriate practices to contribute to their own cognitive development. In order to achieve this aim, we use the REVEAC rating scale. The study results are in correspondence with international studies which highlight the low educational value of the self-proclaimed educational applications. Of considerable concern is the discrepancy between the score of an application from the users and its actual educational value.","authors":["Stamatios J Papadakis","Michail Kalogiannakis"],"meta":["August 2017","Conference: 12th Conference of the European Science Education Research Association (ESERA), «Research, practice and collaboration in science education»At: Dublin, Ireland","Project: Educational apps assessment"],"references":["313087810_Designing_and_creating_an_educational_app_rubric_for_preschool_teachers","292076597_iRPD-A_framework_for_guiding_design-based_research_for_iPad_apps","286462633_The_use_of_touch-screen_tablets_at_home_and_pre-school_to_foster_emergent_literacy","280696834_How_Do_Young_Children_Engage_with_Mobile_Apps_Cognitive_Psychomotor_and_Affective_Perspective","275410459_Putting_Education_in_Educational_Apps_Lessons_From_the_Science_of_Learning","287330118_Mobile_technologies_in_the_service_of_students'_learning_of_mathematics_the_example_of_game_application_ALEX_in_the_context_of_a_primary_school_in_Cyprus","273494454_Singaporean_Parents'_Views_of_Their_Young_Children's_Access_and_Use_of_Technological_Devices"]}
