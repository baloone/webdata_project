{"id":"330651673_The_Wide_Margin_Between_the_Academic_and_Researcher_in_a_New_Age_University_for_Sustainable_Development","abstract":"Faculties in higher institutions will typically be engaged in teaching, research or both. Teachers and researchers are very important in the university. The former ensures adequate transfer of knowledge, inspiration and mentorship to the students and to a large extent eventually determines the quality of their contributions upon graduation. The latter has always been the fulcrum for technological advancement in the society. Though individual preferences play a role in the “wing” each academic “play” in the institution, the institution’s culture has been noted to be a significant determinant. In addition, it has been noted that some scholars tend to focus more on research because it presents attractive incentive from the institution. When this is the case, some faculties that would ordinarily would love to focus on teaching will delve into and spend significant time in research for potential economic gains and often at the detriment of teaching. This work suggests universities should make conscious efforts to shrink the margin between the academic and researcher so as to always satisfy the mission of the universities and meet societal and industry expectations. When the culture in the university supports individual passions, everybody wins.","authors":["Imhade P. Okokpujie","Ojo Sunday Isaac Fayomi","Stephen K.
