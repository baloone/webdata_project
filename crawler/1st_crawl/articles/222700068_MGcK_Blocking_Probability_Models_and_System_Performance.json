{"id":"222700068_MGcK_Blocking_Probability_Models_and_System_Performance","abstract":"An exact solution for the M/G/c/K model is only possible for special cases, such as exponential service, a single server, or no waiting room at all. Instead of basing the approximation on an infinite capacity queue as is often the case, an approximation based on a closed-form expression derivable from the finite capacity exponential queue is presented. Properties of the closed-form expression along with its use in approximating the blocking probability of M/G/c/K systems are discussed. Extensive experiments are provided to test and verify the efficacy of our approximate results.","authors":["J.MacGregor Smith"],"meta":["May 2003Performance Evaluation 52(4):237-267","DOI:10.1016/S0166-5316(02)00190-6","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["268247213_Second-order_properties_of_single-stage_queueing_systems","239583370_Processor_Utilization_in_Multiprogramming_Systems_Via_Diffusion_Approximation","227258083_Second-order_properties_of_the_loss_probability_inMMss_c_systems","226929856_Some_properties_of_the_delay_probability_inMMss_c_systems","222503738_Diffusion_based_statistical_call_admission_control_in_ATM","220431731_On_Approximate_Computer_System_Models","314394098_Stochastic_Modelling_and_Analysis","292417998_Refining_diffusion_approximations_for_GIG1_queues_A_tight_discretization_method","279260747_Buffer_Space_Allocation_in_General_Closed_Finite_Queuing_Networks","265681627_Stochastic_Models_An_Algorithmic_Approach","256418065_A_two-moment_approximation_for_a_buffer_design_problem_requiring_a_small_rejection_probability","245280387_Stochastic_Models_An_Algorithmic_Approach","243047602_Optimal_buffer_design_of_an_MGs_queue_with_finite_capacity","242932621_A_Transform-Free_Approximation_for_the_Finite_Capacity_MGs_Queue","242932213_Strong_Convexity_Results_for_Queueing_Systems","242436179_Fundamentals_of_Queing_Theory","239666832_Tables_for_Multi-Server_Queues","231939258_Heuristics_for_Finite-Buffer_Queues","227446460_Evaluating_the_Overflow_Probability_Using_the_Infinite_Queue","227446015_Sharp_Bounds_and_Simple_Approximations_for_the_Erlang_Delay_and_Loss_Formulas","227445932_Erratum_to_Sharp_Bounds_and_Simple_Approximations_for_the_Erlang_Delay_and_Loss_Formulas","227445066_Note---Comments_on_a_Queueing_Inequality","227445065_Note---Simple_Inequalities_for_Multiserver_Queues","227424730_Buffer_overflow_calculations_using_an_infinite-capacity_model","221443396_A_Diffusion_Cell_Loss_Estimate_for_ATM_with_Multiclass_Bursty_Traffic","220616506_Approximate_Models_for_Processor_Utilization_in_Multiprogrammed_Computer_Systems","216300719_Fundamentals_of_Queuing_Theory","48267100_Stochastic_modeling_and_analysis_of_crime","4941530_Queueing_models_for_performance_analysis_Selection_of_single_station_models","4841987_Queueing_Models_for_a_Flexible_Machining_Station_Parts_I_II","2396645_The_Buffer_Allocation_Problem_for_General_Finite_Buffer_Queueing_Networks"]}
