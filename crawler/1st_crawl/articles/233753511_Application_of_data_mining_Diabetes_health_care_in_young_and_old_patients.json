{"id":"233753511_Application_of_data_mining_Diabetes_health_care_in_young_and_old_patients","abstract":"This research concentrate upon predictive analysis of diabetic treatment using the regression based data mining technique. The Oracle Data Miner (ODM) had been employed as a software mining tool for predicting modes of treating diabetes. The support vector machine algorithm had been used in the experimental analysis. The datasets of Non Communicable Disease (NCD) risk factors, a standard report of Saudi Arabia in collaboration with WHO (World health organization) were employed. The dataset for different age groups of diabetic treatment had been studied and analyzed for the appropriate patterns of treatment. The five age groups had been put into two age groups denoted as p(y) and p(o) as young and old, respectively. The preferential order of treatment prediction had been investigated. We conclude that drug treatment for young age group patient can be delayed to avoid side effects and other treatments are preferred. Whereas for the old age group patients drug treatment along with other treatments are to be prescribed immediately as there are no other alternatives.","authors":["Abdullah A.
