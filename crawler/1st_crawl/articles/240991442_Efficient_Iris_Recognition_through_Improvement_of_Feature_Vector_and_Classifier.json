{"id":"240991442_Efficient_Iris_Recognition_through_Improvement_of_Feature_Vector_and_Classifier","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient method for personal identification by analyzing iris patterns that have a high level of stability and distinctiveness. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system, we present a new approach to making a feature vector compact and efficient by using wavelet transform, and two straightforward but efficient mechanisms for a competitive learning method such as a weight vector initialization and the winner selection. With all of these novel mechanisms, the experimental results showed that the proposed system could be used for personal identification in an efficient and effective manner.","authors":["Shinyoung Lim Lim","Kwanyong Lee Lee","Okhwan Byeon","Taiyun Kim Kim"],"meta":["June 2001Etri Journal 23(2):61-70","DOI:10.4218/etrij.01.0101.0203"],"references":["3316773_A_Human_Identification_Technique_Using_Images_of_the_Iris_and_Wavelet_Transform","303517814_Wavelet_and_signal_processing","275986566_Development_of_Content-Based_Trademark_Retrieval_System_on_the_World_Wide_Web","268248536_Wavelet_Theory_and_Its_Applications","252955114_Recognizing_human_eyes","251075303_Efficient_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_Method_Using_Color_and_Texture","251075147_Extraction_of_Passive_Device_Model_Parameters_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","247181693_Physiology_of_the_Eye_Clinical_Application","242637159_Fundamentals_of_neural_networks_architectures","224277593_Passive_circuit_model_parameter_extraction_using_genetic_algorithm","220692403_Wavelets_and_Filter_Banks","220182132_Daygman_JG_High_Confidence_Visual_Recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_Statistical_Independence_IEEE_Transaction","31643034_Self-Organization_and_Associative_Memory_T_Kohonen","3561327_System_for_automated_iris_recognition","3277315_Iris_recognition_technology","3192194_High_confidence_visual_recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_statistical_independence","2985219_Iris_recognition_An_emerging_biometrie_technology"]}
