{"id":"312387595_Randomized_and_Robust_Methods_for_Uncertain_Systems_using_R-RoMulOC_with_Applications_to_DEMETER_Satellite_Benchmark","abstract":"R-RoMulOC is a freely distributed toolbox which aims at making easily available to the users different optimization-based methods for dealing with uncertain systems. It implements both deterministic LMI-based results, that provide guaranteed performances for all values of the uncertainties, and probabilistic randomization-based approaches, that guarantee performances for all values of the uncertainties except for a subset with arbitrary small probability measure. The paper is devoted to the description of these two approaches for analysis and control design when applied to a satellite benchmark proposed by CNES, the French Space Agency. The paper also describes the modeling of the DEMETER satellite and its integration into the R-RoMulOC toolbox as a challenging test example. Design of state-feedback controllers and closed-loop performance analysis are carried out with the randomized and robust methods available in the R-RoMulOC toolbox.","authors":["Mohammadreza Chamanbaz","Fabrizio Dabbene","Dimitri Peaucelle","Christelle Pittet"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["271526995_Multiobjective_Output-feedback_Control_Via_LMI_Optimization","271526591_Robustness_in_the_Presence_of_Mixed_Parametric_Uncertainty_and_Unmodeled_Dynamics","264123268_Randomized_Methods_for_Design_of_Uncertain_Systems_Sample_Complexity_and_Sequential_Algorithms","236124810_Sequential_Randomized_Algorithms_for_Convex_Optimization_in_the_Presence_of_Uncertainty","323725486_Randomized_algorithms_for_analysis_and_control_of_uncertain_systems_With_applications","321525956_S-Variable_Approach_to_LMI-Based_Robust_Control","301435990_LMI_Results_for_Robust_Control_Design_of_Observer-Based_Controllers_the_Discrete-Time_Case_with_Polytopic_Uncertainties","271476513_Demeter_A_benchmark_for_robust_analysis_and_control_of_the_attitude_of_flexible_micro_satellites","260805198_Robust_control_of_uncertain_systems_Classical_results_and_recent_developments","260735239_Sequential_randomized_algorithms_for_sampled_convex_optimization"]}
