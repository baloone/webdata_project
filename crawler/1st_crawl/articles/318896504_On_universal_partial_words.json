{"id":"318896504_On_universal_partial_words","abstract":"A universal word for a finite alphabet A and some integer is a word over A such that every word of length n appears exactly once as a (consecutive) subword. It is well-known and easy to prove that universal words exist for any A and n. In this work we initiate the systematic study of universal partial words. These are words that in addition to the letters from A may contain an arbitrary number of occurrences of a special ‘joker’ symbol , which can be substituted by any symbol from A. For example, is a universal partial word for the binary alphabet and for (e.g., the first three letters of u yield the subwords 000 and 010). We present results on the existence and non-existence of universal partial words in different situations (depending on the number of ⋄s and their positions), including various explicit constructions. We also provide numerous examples of universal partial words that we found with the help of a computer.","authors":["Herman Z.Q. Chen","Sergey Kitaev","Torsten Mütze","Brian Y.
