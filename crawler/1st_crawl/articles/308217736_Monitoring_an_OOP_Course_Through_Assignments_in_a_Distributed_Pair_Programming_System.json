{"id":"308217736_Monitoring_an_OOP_Course_Through_Assignments_in_a_Distributed_Pair_Programming_System","abstract":"Distributed Pair Programming (DPP) is widely known to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among novice\nprogrammers, while it engages them in carrying out programming assignments. Moreover, DPP is a means of experiencing\nagile software development techniques that are considered important in the software market. In this paper, we share some\nexperiences on using the DPP system of SCEPPSys for carrying out assignments in an undergraduate Object Oriented\nProgramming (OOP) course. Specifically, we focus on the information recorded during problem solving and the statistics\nreported by the system and how this information can be utilized for monitoring both the course regarding the fulfillment of its\ngoals and the programming habits and progress of students. Some proposals are made towards extending the possibilities of\nSCEPPSys for generating automatically more sophisticated reports that would support instructors in more successfully\nmonitoring a course and students. The ultimate goal of such an enhanced monitoring is to improve studentsâ€™ software quality.","authors":["Stelios Xinogalos","Maya Satratzemi","Despina Tsompanoudi","Alexander Chatzigeorgiou"],"meta":["August 2016","Conference: 5th Workshop of Software Quality, Analysis, Monitoring, Improvement, and Applications (SQAMIA 2016)At: 29-31 August 2016, Budapest, Hungary"],"references":["284895759_Distributed_Pair_Programming_Using_Collaboration_Scripts_An_Educational_System_and_Initial_Results","281412450_A_Novel_Approach_for_Collaborative_Pair_Programming","267923802_A_Web-Based_Authoring_Tool_for_Scripting_Distributed_Pair_Programming","258009295_Enhancing_Software_Quality_in_Students'_Programs","221130419_Enhancing_Adaptivity_and_Intelligent_Tutoring_in_Distributed_Pair_Programming_Systems_to_Support_Novice_Programmers","221107961_Sangam_A_distributed_pair_programming_plug-in_for_eclipse","26849635_Evaluating_the_Effects_of_Virtual_Pair_Programming_on_Students'_Achievement_and_Satisfaction","4352405_An_Analysis_of_Students'_Difficulties_with_ArrayList_Object_Collections_and_Proposals_for_Supporting_the_Learning_Process","220807572_A_development_environment_for_distributed_synchronous_collaborative_programming","220349756_Understanding_Tools_and_Practices_for_Distributed_Pair_Programming"]}
