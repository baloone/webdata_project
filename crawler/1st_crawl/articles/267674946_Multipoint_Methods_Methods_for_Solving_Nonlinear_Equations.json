{"id":"267674946_Multipoint_Methods_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","abstract":"Multipoint iterative methods belong to the class of the most efficient methods for solving nonlinear equations. Recent interest in the research and development of this type of methods has arisen from their capability to overcome theoretical limits of one-point methods concerning the convergence order and computational efficiency. This survey paper is a mixture of theoretical results and algorithmic aspects and it is intended as a review of the most efficient root-finding algorithms and developing techniques in a general sense. Many existing methods of great efficiency appear as special cases of presented general iterative schemes. Special attention is devoted to multipoint methods with memory that use already computed information to considerably increase convergence rate without additional computational costs. Some classical results of the 1970s which have had a great influence to the topic, often neglected or unknown to many readers, are also included not only as historical notes but also as genuine sources of many recent ideas. To a certain degree, the presented study follows in parallel main themes shown in the recently published book (Petković et al., 2013) [53], written by the authors of this paper.","authors":["Miodrag S.
