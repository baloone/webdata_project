{"id":"325027680_Cyberbullying_A_concept_analysis_of_defining_attributes_and_additional_influencing_factors","abstract":"Cyberbullying is an important phenomenon but to date there exists no universally accepted definition.\nThis leads to a variety of Definitions and conceptualizations, making it almost impossible to generalize\ntheir results. The purposes of this paper are 1) to present the current state of definitions, 2) to define\ncyberbullying based on a concept analysis), 3) to illustrate relationships between defining attributes and\nother possible influencing factors, and 4) to discuss which characteristics should be considered in the\nvaluation of a cyberbullying incident. Therefore, definitions that emerged between 2012 and 2017 were\nanalyzed. A systematic literature search resulted in 24 definitions for qualitative synthesis. Descriptive\nanalysis revealed five defining attributes of cyberbullying that were shared across all identified definitions.\nOverall, 15 characteristics were determined to describe the phenomenon. A definition is proposed,\nand additional influencing factors are discussed. Our results suggest that there exist five main defining\nattributes of cyberbullying which a variety of researchers use to define cyberbullying. Future research\nshould conduct more qualitative studies with adolescents in order to validate these attributes. If researchers\nand adolescents share the same understanding, the proposed definition can be used in future\nstudies, making their findings more comparable to each other.","authors":["Ira-Katharina Petras","Franz Petermann"],"meta":["May 2018Computers in Human Behavior 86:350-366","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.013","Project: Cyberbullying: A concept analysis"],"references":["311432959_Bullying_behavior_of_Pakistani_pre-adolescents_Findings_based_on_olweus_questionnaire","279414671_Chapter_8_Cyberbullying_Voices_of_College_Students","270002336_Exploring_traditional_and_cyberbullying_among_Irish_adolescents","269286529_Cyberbullying_involvement_among_students_with_ADHD_relation_to_loneliness_self-efficacy_and_social_support","268791078_Cyberbullying_The_Discriminant_Factors_Among_Cyberbullies_Cybervictims_and_Cyberbully-Victims_in_a_Czech_Adolescent_Sample","261746685_Overlapping_Verbal_Relational_Physical_and_Electronic_Forms_of_Bullying_in_Adolescence_Influence_of_School_Context","232319833_Bullying_and_cyberbullying_Overlapping_and_predictive_value_of_the_co-occurrence","306089969_Longitudinal_Associations_Between_Cyberbullying_Involvement_and_Adolescent_Mental_Health","304402139_Perceived_reasons_for_the_negative_impact_of_cyberbullying_and_traditional_bullying","276138897_Cyberbullying_of_teachers_by_students_on_YouTube_challenging_the_image_of_teacher_authority_in_the_digital_age","272496415_Cyberbullying_self-esteem_empathy_and_loneliness","272495479_An_Investigation_of_Short-Term_Longitudinal_Associations_Between_Social_Anxiety_and_Victimization_and_Perpetration_of_Traditional_Bullying_and_Cyberbullying","263337624_I_Hate_Everything_About_You_A_Qualitative_Examination_of_Cyberbullying_and_On-Line_Aggression_in_a_College_Sample","258189349_Traditional_bullying_as_a_potential_warning_sign_of_cyberbullying","236885823_Cyberbullying_assessment_instruments_A_systematic_review"]}
