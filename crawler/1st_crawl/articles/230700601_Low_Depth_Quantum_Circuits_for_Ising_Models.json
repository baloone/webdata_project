{"id":"230700601_Low_Depth_Quantum_Circuits_for_Ising_Models","abstract":"A scheme for measuring complex temperature partition functions of Ising\nmodels is introduced. In the context of ordered qubit registers this scheme\nfinds a natural translation in terms of global operations, and single particle\nmeasurements on the edge of the array. Two applications of this scheme are\npresented. First, through appropriate Wick rotations, those amplitudes can be\nanalytically continued to yield estimates for partition functions of Ising\nmodels. Bounds on the estimation error, valid with high confidence, are\nprovided through a central-limit theorem, which validity extends beyond the\npresent context. It holds for example for estimations of the Jones polynomial.\nInterestingly, the kind of state preparations and measurements involved in this\napplication can in principle be made \"instantaneous\", i.e. independent of the\nsystem size or the parameters being simulated. Second, the scheme allows to\naccurately estimate some non-trivial invariants of links. A third result\nconcerns the computational power of estimations of partition functions for real\ntemperature classical ferromagnetic Ising models on a square lattice. We\nprovide conditions under which estimating such partition functions allows one\nto reconstruct scattering amplitudes of quantum circuits making the problem\nBQP-hard. Using this mapping, we show that fidelity overlaps for ground states\nof quantum Hamiltonians, which serve as a witness to quantum phase transitions,\ncan be estimated from classical Ising model partition functions. Finally, we\nshow that the ability to accurately measure corner magnetizations on thermal\nstates of two-dimensional Ising models with magnetic field leads to fully\npolynomial random approximation schemes (FPRAS) for the partition function.\nEach of these results corresponds to a section of the text that can be\nessentially read independently.","authors":["S.
