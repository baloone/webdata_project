{"id":"339301390_Modeling_Multi-turn_Conversation_with_Deep_Utterance_Aggregation","abstract":"Multi-turn conversation understanding is a major challenge for building intelligent dialogue systems. This work focuses on retrieval-based response matching for multi-turn conversation whose related work simply concatenates the conversation utterances, ignoring the interactions among previous utterances for context modeling. In this paper, we formulate previous utterances into context using a proposed deep utterance aggregation model to form a fine-grained context representation. In detail, a self-matching attention is first introduced to route the vital information in each utterance. Then the model matches a response with each refined utterance and the final matching score is obtained after attentive turns aggregation. Experimental results show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three multi-turn conversation benchmarks, including a newly introduced e-commerce dialogue corpus.","authors":["Zhuosheng Zhang","Jiangtong Li","Pengfei Zhu","Hai Zhao"],"meta":["August 2018","Conference: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational LinguisticsAt: Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","Project: Natural Language Undertanding & Machine Reading Comprehension"],"references":["344325679_Seq2seq_Dependency_Parsing","339301442_One-shot_Learning_for_Question-Answering_in_Gaokao_History_Challenge","334117322_Syntax_for_Semantic_Role_Labeling_To_Be_Or_Not_To_Be","334114912_Moon_IME_Neural-based_Chinese_Pinyin_Aided_Input_Method_with_Customizable_Association","325447991_SJTU-NLP_at_SemEval-2018_Task_9_Neural_Hypernym_Discovery_with_Term_Embeddings","322063466_Mechanism-aware_Neural_Machine_for_Dialogue_Response_Generation","318741788_AliMe_Chat_A_Sequence_to_Sequence_and_Rerank_based_Chatbot_Engine","334115962_Personalizing_Dialogue_Agents_I_have_a_dog_do_you_have_pets_too","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","318742365_Sequential_Matching_Network_A_New_Architecture_for_Multi-turn_Response_Selection_in_Retrieval-Based_Chatbots"]}
