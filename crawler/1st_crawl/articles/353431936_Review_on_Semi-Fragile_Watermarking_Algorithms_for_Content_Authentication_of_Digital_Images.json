{"id":"353431936_Review_on_Semi-Fragile_Watermarking_Algorithms_for_Content_Authentication_of_Digital_Images","abstract":"With the popularity of network and the continuous development of multimedia technology, saving of network bandwidth and copyright protection of multimedia content have gradually attracted peopleâ€™s attention. The fragile watermark for integrity authentication of image data and protection of copyright has become a hotspot. In the storage and transmission process, image data must be compressed to save network bandwidth. As a result, semi-fragile watermarking techniques, which can be used to distinguish common image processing operations from malicious tampering, are emerging. In this paper, semi-fragile watermarking algorithms for image authentication are surveyed. The basic principles and characteristics about semi-fragile watermarking algorithms are introduced, and several kinds of attack behaviors are also included. Aiming at several typical image-authentication algorithms, advantages and disadvantages are analyzed, and evaluation indexes of various algorithms are compared. Finally, we analyze the key points and difficulties in the study on semi-fragile watermarking algorithms, and the direction about future development is prospected.","authors":["Xiaoyan Yu","Chengyou Wang","Xiao Zhou"],"meta":["September 2017Future Internet 9(4):56","DOI:10.3390/fi9040056"],"references":["303091259_Self-embedding_watermarking_scheme_against_JPEG_compression_with_superior_imperceptibility","271920196_Semi-fragile_self-recoverable_watermarking_algorithm_based_on_wavelet_group_quantization_and_double_authentication","338689441_Tamper_detection_and_self-recovery_scheme_by_DWT_watermarking","317310570_Intelligent_Watermarking_Scheme_for_image_Authentication_and_Recovery","317111598_Watermarking_based_image_authentication_and_tamper_detection_algorithm_using_vector_quantization_approach","296964281_DCT_based_semi-fragile_watermarking_technique","290922380_Wavelet_domain_semi-fragile_watermarking_algorithm_for_image_authentication","289661751_A_novel_semi-fragile_digital_watermarking_algorithm_for_image_content_authentication_localization_and_recovery","285679642_Semi-fragile_watermarking_for_JPEG2000_image_authentication","283534264_Watermarking-based_image_authentication_robust_to_JPEG_compression"]}
