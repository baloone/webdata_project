{"id":"267632284_Chaotic_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Solving_Definite_Integral","abstract":"In this paper, an Improved Firefly Algorithm with Chaos (IFCH) is presented for solving definite integral. The IFCH satisfies the question of parallel calculating numerical integration in engineering and those segmentation points are adaptive. Several numerical simulation results show that the algorithm offers an efficient way to calculate the numerical value of definite integrals, and has a high convergence rate, high accuracy and robustness.","authors":["Ibrahim Mahmoud El-henawy","Osama Abdel-Raouf","Mohamed Abdel-Baset"],"meta":["May 2014International Journal of Information Technology and Computer Science 6(6):19-24","DOI:10.5815/ijitcs.2014.06.03"],"references":["287011000_Multiobjective_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Continuous_Optimization","259465688_Quantifying_Chaos_With_Lyapunov_Exponents","257722304_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_An_Overview","324305922_Methods_of_Numerical_Integration","317415312_Advanced_engineering_mathematics","289195712_Discrete_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_New_Movement_Scheme","273047180_Chaos_and_Nonlinear_Dynamics_An_Introduction_for_Scientists_and_Engineers","265670591_An_Introduction_To_Chaotic_Dynamics_Systems","261467888_Promoting_products_online_using_firefly_algorithm","259170624_A_comprehensive_review_of_firefly_algorithms"]}
