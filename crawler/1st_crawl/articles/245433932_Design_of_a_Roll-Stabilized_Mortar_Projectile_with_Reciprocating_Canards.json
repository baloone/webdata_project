{"id":"245433932_Design_of_a_Roll-Stabilized_Mortar_Projectile_with_Reciprocating_Canards","abstract":"The design of a canard-controlled mortar projectile using a bank-to-turn concept is presented. A unique feature of this smart mortar configuration is that it is equipped with a set of two reciprocating fixed-angle maneuver canards and a set of two reciprocating fixed-angle roll canards. An active control system is designed such that the roll canards set the body in the proper maneuver plane and the maneuver canards extend to perform trajectory corrections. Example results and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate control system effectiveness in reducing dispersion error due to launch perturbations and winds. Comparison studies with a rolling airframe equipped with reciprocating maneuver canards show that the bank-to-turn approach offers more control authority, eliminates problematic angle-of-attack oscillations, and requires lower-bandwidth actuators.","authors":["Jonathan Rogers","Mark Costello"],"meta":["July 2010Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics 33(4):1026-1034","DOI:10.2514/1.47820"],"references":["262904376_Extended_Range_of_a_Gun_Launched_Smart_Projectile_Using_Controllable_Canards","281477365_Excalibur_New_precision_engagement_asset_in_the_warfight","269064450_Effect_of_internal_mass_unbalance_on_the_terminal_accuracy_and_stability_of_a_field_artillery_projectile","245431222_A_Lesson_Learned_about_Cannon-Launched_Guided_Projectiles","245430390_Extension_of_Projectile_Range_Using_Oblique-Wing_Concept","239415680_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Cannon-Launched_Guided_Projectile","235198348_Dynamics_of_Atmospheric_Flight","235190989_FREE_FLIGHT_MOTION_OF_SYMMETRIC_MISSILES"]}
