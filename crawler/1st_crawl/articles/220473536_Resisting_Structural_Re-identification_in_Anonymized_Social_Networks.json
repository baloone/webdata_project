{"id":"220473536_Resisting_Structural_Re-identification_in_Anonymized_Social_Networks","abstract":"We identify privacy risks associated with releasing network datasets and provide an algorithm that mitigates those risks.\nA network dataset is a graph representing entities connected by edges representing relations such as friendship, communication\nor shared activity. Maintaining privacy when publishing a network dataset is uniquely challenging because an individualâ€™s\nnetwork context can be used to identify them even if other identifying information is removed. In this paper, we introduce\na parameterized model of structural knowledge available to the adversary and quantify the success of attacks on individuals\nin anonymized networks. We show that the risks of these attacks vary based on network structure and size and provide theoretical\nresults that explain the anonymity risk in random networks. We then propose a novel approach to anonymizing network data that\nmodels aggregate network structure and allows analysis to be performed by sampling from the model. The approach guarantees\nanonymity for entities in the network while allowing accurate estimates of a variety of network measures with relatively little\nbias.","authors":["Michael Hay","Gerome Miklau","David Donald Jensen","Donald F.
