{"id":"336131793_Recursive_AOP_for_Reversible_Software","abstract":"Innovative paradigm of reversible computing (RC) is on the focus of current computer science. The main idea of it is to enable the execution of programs not forward only (as it is now) but backwards as well. The set of possible applications of RC includes software debugging, faulttolerance increasing and quantum computing. In order to do reversible computing operational there is a need to code (manually) or to generate opposite “reverse” element for each “forward” element. However, this emerging paradigm still needs the methods for expressing opposite language elements in advance (during design-time). On the other hand, classic Aspect oriented paradigm (AOP) helps to deal with crosscutting concerns such as security, transactions etc. at design time, allows to separate development tasks by proficiency instead of by modules and to run weaved program at run-time. In this paper author present the idea to express opposite language elements by using recursive aspects.","authors":["Vaidas Giedrimas"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.22364/bjmc.2019.7.3.09"],"references":["323055150_Aspect_Oriented_Programs_Issues_and_Perspective","301344042_A_Class_of_Reversible_Primitive_Recursive_Functions","274151176_A_Semantics_of_Poincuts_in_AspectJ","273511599_A_Taxonomy_of_Domain-Specific_Aspect_Languages","328868162_A_categorical_foundation_for_structured_reversible_flowchart_languages_Soundness_and_adequacy","328664063_A_theory_of_reversibility_for_Erlang","312971599_Dynamic_Slicing_of_Distributed_Aspect-Oriented_Programs_A_Context-sensitive_Approach","307440159_Join_inverse_categories_and_reversible_recursion","283897074_On_the_weaving_process_of_aspect-oriented_product_family_algebra","265083092_JANUS_A_TIME-REVERSIBLE_LANGUAGE","222555759_Reversible_Computation_and_Reversible_Programming_Languages","246099571_Et_al_Aspect-Oriented_Programming","222984738_Aspect-oriented_model-driven_skeleton_code_generation_A_graph-based_transformation_approach","222151786_Cooperative_Aspect-Oriented_Programming","220919153_Avoiding_Infinite_Recursion_with_Stratified_Aspects"]}
