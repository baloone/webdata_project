{"id":"326286137_Identifying_influential_nodes_based_on_network_representation_learning_in_complex_networks","abstract":"Identifying influential nodes is an important topic in many diverse applications, such as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases. Many methods have been put forward to identify influential nodes in complex networks, ranging from node centrality to diffusion-based processes. However, most of the previous studies do not take into account overlapping communities in networks. In this paper, we propose an effective method based on network representation learning. The method considers not only the overlapping communities in networks, but also the network structure. Experiments on real-world networks show that the proposed method outperforms many benchmark algorithms and can be used in large-scale networks.","authors":["Hao Wei","Zhisong Pan","Guyu Hu","Liangliang Zhang"],"meta":["July 2018PLoS ONE 13(7):e0200091","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0200091"],"references":["291136511_Locating_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks","290522336_The_H-index_of_a_network_node_and_its_relation_to_degree_and_coreness","307950293_Big_Data_Analytics_for_Social_Network_-_The_Base_Study","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","287496110_La_centralidad_en_las_redes_sociales_Clarificacion_conceptual_Centrality_in_social_networks_Conceptual_clarification","284009853_Leaders_in_communities_of_real-world_networks","279692026_From_the_book_review_editor_--_Structural_Holes_The_Social_Structure_of_Competition_by_Ronald_S_Burt","270877801_A_Computer_Method_for_Calculating_Kendall's_Tau_with_Ungrouped_Data","268998853_A_Computer_Method_for_Calculating_Kendall's_Tau_with_Ungrouped_Data","262272761_Overlapping_community_detection_at_scale_A_nonnegative_matrix_factorization_approach"]}
