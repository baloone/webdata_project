{"id":"228617946_Partially_Ordered_Monads_for_Monadic_Topologies_Rough_Sets_and_Kleene_Algebras","abstract":"In this paper we will show that partially ordered monads contain sufficient structure for modelling monadic topologies, rough sets and Kleene algebras. Convergence represented by extension structures over partially ordered monads includes notions of regularity and compactness. A compactification theory can be developed. Rough sets [23] are modelled in a generalized setting with set functors. Further, we show how partially ordered monads can be used in order to obtain monad based examples of Kleene algebras building upon a wide range of set functors far beyond just strings [19] and relations [27].","authors":["Patrik Eklund","M.
