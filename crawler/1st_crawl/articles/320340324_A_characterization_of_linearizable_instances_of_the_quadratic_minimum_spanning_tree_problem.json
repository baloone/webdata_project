{"id":"320340324_A_characterization_of_linearizable_instances_of_the_quadratic_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","abstract":"We investigate special cases of the quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP) on a graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) that can be solved as a linear minimum spanning tree problem. We give a characterization of such problems when G is a complete graph, which is the standard case in the QMSTP literature. We extend our characterization to a larger class of graphs that include complete bipartite graphs and cactuses, among others. Our characterization can be verified in \\(O(|E|^2)\\) time. In the case of complete graphs and when the cost matrix is given in factored form, we show that our characterization can be verified in O(|E|) time. Related open problems are also indicated.","authors":["Ante Custic","Abraham P.
