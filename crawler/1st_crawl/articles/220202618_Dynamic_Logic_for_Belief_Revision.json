{"id":"220202618_Dynamic_Logic_for_Belief_Revision","abstract":"We show how belief revision can be treated systematically inthe format of dynamic- epistemic logic, when operators of conditional belief are a dded. The core engine consists of definable update rules for changing plausibility relationsbetween worlds, which have been proposed independently in the dynamic-epistemic literatu re on preference change. Our analysis yields two new types of modal result. First, we obtain comple te logics for concrete mechanisms of belief revision, based on compositional reduction axiom s. Next, we show how various ab- stract postulates for belief revision can be analyzed by sta ndard modal frame correspondences for model-changing operations.","authors":["Johan van Benthem"],"meta":["January 2007Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics 17(2):129-155","DOI:10.3166/jancl.17.129-155","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265372978_Aggregating_Sets_of_Judgments_Two_Impossibility_Results_Compared_1","259811245_Logics_for_Conditionals","254853660_Bisimulations_on_Planet_Kripke","251467773_21_Modal_logic_and_philosophy","240186438_Preference_Change_and_Information_Processing","238681232_Ordinal_Conditional_Functions_A_Dynamic_Theory_of_Epistemic_States","228726359_Preference_logic_conditionals_and_solution_concepts_in_games","228385056_Dynamic_belief_revision_over_multi-agent_plausibility_models","228378627_The_logic_of_conditional_doxastic_actions_A_theory_of_dynamic_multi-agent_belief_revision","225817706_Defaults_in_Update_Semantics","225503900_Prolegomena_to_Dynamic_Logic_for_Belief_Revision","221551266_Common_knowledge_in_update_logics","220298218_The_Undecidability_of_Iterated_Modal_Relativization","220202733_From_onions_to_broccoliGeneralizing_Lewis_counterfactual_logic","220202727_Dynamic_Logic_of_Preference_Upgrade","2907909_Diversity_of_Logical_Agents_in_Games","2903541_From_Belief_Revision_to_Belief_Fusion","2699599_Changing_Preferences","2552913_A_Knowledge_Based_Semantics_of_Messages","284041064_One_is_a_lonely_number_On_the_logic_of_communication","265370396_Basic_Tense_Logic","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","247925236_The_Logic_of_Reliable_Inquiry","246719182_Logics_for_Preference_Ceteris_Paribus","238316401_Semantic_Parallels_in_Natural_Language_and_Computation","227221302_Open_Problems_in_Logical_Dynamics","227118863_Default_Logic_as_Dynamic_Doxastic_Logic","223051563_Logics_of_Communication_and_Change","222144954_Conditional_Logics_of_Normality_A_Modal_Approach","220705990_The_Tree_of_Knowledge_in_Action_Towards_a_Common_Perspective","220245478_Belief_Revision_From_the_Point_of_View_of_Doxastic_Logic","38355029_Irrevocable_Belief_Revision_in_Dynamic_Doxastic_Logic","2808989_Interpolation_Preservation_and_Pebble_Games","2605506_A_Combined_System_for_Update_Logic_and_Belief_Revision"]}
