{"id":"335503021_Real-time_interactive_holographic_3D_display_with_a_360_horizontal_viewing_zone","abstract":"To realize a real-time interactive holographic three-dimensional (3D) display system, we synthesize a set of 24 full high-definition (HD) binary computer-generated holograms (CGHs) based on a 3D fast-Fourier-transform-based approach. These 24 CGHs are streamed into a digital micromirror device (DMD) as a single 24-bit image at 60 Hz: 1440 CGHs are synthesized in less than a second. Continual updates of the CGHs displayed on the DMD and synchronization with a rotating mirror enlarges the horizontal viewing zone to 360Â° using a time-division approach. We successfully demonstrate interactive manipulation, such as object rotation, rendering mode switching, and threshold value alteration, for a medical dataset of a human head obtained by X-ray computed tomography.","authors":["Yusuke Sando","Kazuo Satoh","Daisuke Barada","Toyohiko Yatagai"],"meta":["December 2019Applied Optics 58(34):G1","DOI:10.1364/AO.58.0000G1"],"references":["272101262_High-Performance_Computer-Generated_Hologram_by_Optimized_Implementation_of_Parallel_GPGPUs","251878461_The_Cancer_Imaging_Archive_TCIA_Maintaining_and_Operating_a_Public_Information_Repository","326887984_Review_of_fast_methods_for_point-based_computer-generated_holography_Invited","310621547_360-Degree_tabletop_electronic_holographic_display","290453806_Fast_point-based_method_of_a_computer-generated_hologram_for_a_triangle-patch_model_by_using_a_graphics_processing_unit","283465735_A_review_of_dynamic_holographic_3D_display_algorithms_devices_and_systems","273473466_Table_screen_360-degree_holographic_display_using_circular_viewing-zone_scanning","265736364_Holographic_3D_display_observable_for_multiple_simultaneous_viewers_from_all_horizontal_directions_by_using_a_time_division_method","257301289_Fast_distributed_large-pixel-count_hologram_computation_using_a_GPU_cluster","249320668_Hidden_surface_removal_of_computer-generated_holograms_for_arbitrary_diffraction_directions","234070096_Volumetric_display_using_a_rotating_prism_sheet_as_an_optical_image_scanner","232086747_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated_holograms_based_on_3-D_Fourier_spectrum_for_omnidirectional_diffraction_from_a_3-D_voxel-based_object","220721965_360-degree_autostereoscopic_display","40443365_Graphics_processing_unit_accelerated_computation_of_digital_holograms"]}
