{"id":"317337066_Systems_Engineering_as_a_Foundation_for_PSS_Development_Project_Motivations_and_Perspectives","abstract":"Product-Service System has been proposed as a promising dematerialization strategy to respond to the economic, social, technological and environmental challenges. While the concepts and incentives for PSS adoption are well-defined, there is an inconclusive debate on PSS development methodology. Scholars with different facets have addressed the question of optimized approach in PSS development project considering either the classical development process of the PSS components or a new tailored development approach. This paper outlines the idea of adopting an existing advanced reference approach as the foundation to manage PSS development project throughout its whole lifecycle. Exploring this perspective, current paper proposes tailoring the Systems Engineering for managing PSS development project.","authors":["Elaheh Maleki","Farouk Belkadi","Alain Bernard"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 64:205-210","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2017.03.031"],"references":["316818001_PSS_Pattern_Concept_for_Knowledge_Representation_in_Design_Process_of_Industrial_Product-service_Systems","284096376_The_Functional_Products_Technical_Lifecycle_and_its_Four_Sub-lifecycles","276298825_Interactions_between_Service_and_Product_Lifecycle_Management","344950757_New_Business_for_Old_Europe_Product-Service_Development_Competitiveness_and_Sustainability","311509010_Industrial_productservice_systems-ips2","311255924_Computational_Design_Synthesis_Using_Model-Driven_Engineering_and_Constraint_Programming","308366034_A_customization-oriented_framework_for_design_of_sustainable_productservice_system","285281313_Modularity_and_outsourcing_The_nature_of_co-evolution_of_product_architecture_and_organization_architecture_in_the_global_automotive_industry","277290535_Viewpoints_A_Framework_for_Integrating_Multiple_Perspectives_in_System_Development","275165598_Product_services_for_a_resource-efficient_and_circular_economy_-_A_review"]}
