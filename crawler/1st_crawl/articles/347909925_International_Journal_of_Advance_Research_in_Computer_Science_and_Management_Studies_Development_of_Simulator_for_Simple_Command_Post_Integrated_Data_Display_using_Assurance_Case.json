Present paper has explored an approach of developing software for command post integrated data display Simulator based on Assurance Case driven development. This paper has systematically illustrated how software development for a software system can be carried out using Assurance Cases. The developed code was tested using rigorous test cases to ensure that the goals and sub-goals are met with adequate reliability and safety and thus the overall simulator goal. The design was further verified with collected artifacts through actual testing to ensure that the developed Simulator is working as per the stated requirements under all specified operating conditions. We concluded with discussion of important results and suggestions for addressing the problems we faced while developing the Simulator software using Assurance Case.","authors":["Shamlal Dipak","Dipak Gade","Santosh Deshpande"],"meta":["December 2020"],"references":["347909609_Assurance_Driven_Software_Design_using_Assurance_Case_Based_Approach","347909601_A_Literature_Review_on_Assurance_Driven_Software_Design","221431021_Assurance_Cases_in_Model-Driven_Development_of_the_Pacemaker_Software","4371243_Using_an_Assurance_Case_to_Support_Independent_Assessment_of_the_Transition_to_a_New_GPS_Ground_Control_System","4261637_Assurance_Based_Development_of_Critical_Systems"]}
