{"id":"276107065_Homomorphisms_and_colourings_of_oriented_graphs_An_updated_survey","abstract":"An oriented graph is a loopless digraph with no opposite arcs. An oriented k-colouring of an oriented graph G{combining right arrow above} is a partition of its set of vertices into k parts in such a way that no two adjacent vertices belong to the same part, and all the arcs connecting every two parts have the same direction. Hence, such a colouring exists if and only if G{combining right arrow above} admits a homomorphism to some oriented graph of order k.The oriented chromatic number of G{combining right arrow above} is then defined as the smallest k for which G{combining right arrow above} admits an oriented k-colouring or, equivalently, as the minimum order of an oriented graph to which G{combining right arrow above} admits a homomorphism.In this paper, we survey the main results about oriented colourings and propose a few open problems.","authors":["Eric Sopena"],"meta":["April 2015Discrete Mathematics 339(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2015.03.018"],"references":["353514069_Simple_colorings_and_simple_homomorphisms","268819801_Outerplanar_and_Planar_Oriented_Cliques","295804770_The_simple_chromatic_number_of_oriented_graphs","295584024_On_Oriented_Graphs_with_Certain_Extension_Properties","287376966_A_theory_of_2-dipath_colourings","281718859_An_oriented_7-colouring_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_at_least_7","281597120_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_graph_homomorphisms_and_colorings","278630142_The_complexity_of_deciding_whether_a_graph_admits_an_orientation_with_fixed_weak_diameter","268311969_The_search_for_N-ec_Graphs","268046195_Maximum_Order_of_a_Planar_Oclique_Is_15"]}
