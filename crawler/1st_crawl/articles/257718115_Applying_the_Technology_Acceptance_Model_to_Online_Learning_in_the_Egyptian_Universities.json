{"id":"257718115_Applying_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_to_Online_Learning_in_the_Egyptian_Universities","abstract":"The purpose of the research is to identify the determinants of students’ acceptance of online learning and to investigate how these determinants can shape students’ intention to use online learning. A conceptual framework based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was modified. A questionnaire was developed and used to solicit information from the 153 undergraduate students who used online learning in DBMU. The results reveal that students’ perception of ease of use, usefulness, attitudes towards online learning, and the social influence of students’ referent group were identified as significant determinants of students’ intention to practice online learning. The possibility of using the social influence of students’ referent group, students’ perceived ease of use, students’ perceived usefulness and their attitudes towards online learning to predict their behavioral intention to use online learning was also confirmed.","authors":["Taher Farahat"],"meta":["November 2012Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 64:95–104","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.012"],"references":["320656842_The_Emotional_State_of_Technology_Acceptance","285914163_Applying_the_technology_acceptance_model_and_flow_theory_to_online_e-learning_users'_acceptance_behavior","277983543_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Theories_and_Models","266587480_The_Influence_of_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_Subjective_Norm_on_the_Use_of_Computed_Radiography_Systems_A_Pilot_Study","266074838_Factors_Affecting_Acceptance_and_Use_of_Moodle_An_Empirical_Study_Based_on_TAM","264977877_E-Learning_Investigating_University_Student's_Acceptance_of_Technology","330433249_The_Impact_of_Group_Membership_on_Persuasion_Revisiting_Who_Says_What_to_Whom_With_What_Effect_The_Role_of_Norms_and_Group_Membership","285192739_Applying_theory_of_perceived_risk_and_technology_acceptance_model_in_the_online_shopping_channel","284417406_Impact_of_perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_of_use_and_perceived_enjoyment_on_intention_to_shop_online","263464369_User_acceptance_of_information_technology_System_characteristics_user_perceptions_and_behavioral_impacts"]}
