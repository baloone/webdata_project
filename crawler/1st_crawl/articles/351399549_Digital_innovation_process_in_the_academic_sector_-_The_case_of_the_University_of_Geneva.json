{"id":"351399549_Digital_innovation_process_in_the_academic_sector_-_The_case_of_the_University_of_Geneva","abstract":"In this paper, we describe an innovative process towards digital transformation in the high-educational field, developed at the University of Geneva since 2016. It aims to provide novel services identified proactively as of high value for improving student and university members experience. This approach is made possible through our Digital Innovation Hub and its different tools. One of these tools is the “Accelerator of digital science and services”, born from the original combined effort of two main digital actors of the university: The Information Systems Division (DISTIC) entity, providing professional expertise in developing and deploying digital services, and the Computer Science Center (CUI), providing research-led innovations. Through the Accelerator, we experiment and incrementally build new innovative services to be scaled up and deployed. This paper reports on our experience gathered throughout the establishment of this innovative process and its impact on governance and structure.","authors":["Giovanna Di Marzo Serugendo","Lamia Friha"],"meta":["January 2021ITM Web of Conferences 38:03004","DOI:10.1051/itmconf/20213803004"],"references":["342052514_Digital_Transformation_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","350411161_Build_to_think_build_to_learn_what_can_fabrication_and_creativity_bring_to_rethink_higher_education","225111059_Fundamentals_of_service_science"]}
