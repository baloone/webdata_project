Understanding the genetic mechanisms of resistance will help to identify strategies and biomarkers that are essential for the next line of therapy.\n\nPatients and methods: \nWe analyzed whole exomes of patient-matched pre- and post-treatment tumors from patients with CRPC. These patients had received the secondary androgen-deprivation therapy agent, abiraterone, which suppresses androgens to below castration levels, or enzalutamide, which competitively inhibits the key androgen signaling effector, androgen receptor.\n\nResults: \nWe observed that abiraterone-resistant tumors harbored alterations in AR and MYC, whereas enzalutamide-resistant tumors gained alterations in cell-cycle pathway genes, such as mutation in cyclin-dependent kinase N2A (CDKN2A) or amplification of CDK6. Experimentally, overexpressing cell-cycle kinases promoted enzalutamide resistance in androgen-sensitive LnCAP cells that was mitigated via CDK4/6 blockade-palbociclib and ribociclib.\n\nConclusion: \nCDK4/6-mediated resistance observed in preclinical experiments suggests that CDK4/6 amplifications may sufficiently promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC, and that these patients may respond to palbociclib or ribociclib. The overall observations suggest that, in genomically selected advanced CRPC, clinical strategies against abiraterone- or enzalutamide-resistant tumors may require treatment strategies that are tailored to the resistance mechanisms that are specific to those patient subpopulations.","authors":["G Celine Han","Justin Hwang","Stephanie A M Wankowicz","Zhenwei Zhang"],"meta":["December 2017JCO Precision Oncology 1(1)","DOI:10.1200/PO.17.00140"],"references":["311348666_COSMIC_Somatic_cancer_genetics_at_high-resolution","311165553_Truncation_and_constitutive_activation_of_the_androgen_receptor_by_diverse_genomic_rearrangements_in_prostate_cancer","299500296_Acquired_resistance_to_the_second-generation_androgen_receptor_antagonist_enzalutamide_in_castration-resistant_prostate_cancer","283828673_Plasma_AR_and_abiraterone-resistant_prostate_cancer","283305922_DNA-Repair_Defects_and_Olaparib_in_Metastatic_Prostate_Cancer","281272467_Abiraterone_and_Increased_Survival_in_Metastatic_Prostate_Cancer","277080327_Integrative_Clinical_Genomics_of_Advanced_Prostate_Cancer","265342865_AR-V7_and_Resistance_to_Enzalutamide_and_Abiraterone_in_Prostate_Cancer","262804522_Enzalutamide_in_Metastatic_Prostate_Cancer_before_Chemotherapy","248396962_An_F876L_Mutation_in_Androgen_Receptor_Confers_Genetic_and_Phenotypic_Resistance_to_MDV3100_Enzalutamide","236939795_Targeting_cell_cycle_and_hormone_receptor_pathways_in_cancer","236909552_Androgen_Receptor_Promotes_Ligand-Independent_Prostate_Cancer_Progression_through_c-Myc_Upregulation","224966136_The_cBio_Cancer_Genomics_Portal_An_Open_Platform_for_Exploring_Multidimensional_Cancer_Genomics_Data","23715184_Ligand-Independent_Androgen_Receptor_Variants_Derived_from_Splicing_of_Cryptic_Exons_Signify_Hormone-Refractory_Prostate_Cancer","8971491_Myc_confers_androgen-independent_prostate_cancer_cell_growth","5542344_Design_and_End_Points_of_Clinical_Trials_for_Patients_With_Progressive_Prostate_Cancer_and_Castrate_Levels_of_Testosterone_Recommendations_of_the_Prostate_Cancer_Clinical_Trials_Working_Group","317343031_Abiraterone_plus_Prednisone_in_Metastatic_Castration-Sensitive_Prostate_Cancer","310470137_Palbociclib_and_Letrozole_in_Advanced_Breast_Cancer","304910715_Current_understanding_of_resistance_to_abiraterone_and_enzalutamide_in_advanced_prostate_cancer","301937225_Genomic_Alterations_in_Cell-Free_DNA_and_Enzalutamide_Resistance_in_Castration-Resistant_Prostate_Cancer","290183302_Cancer_Statistics_2016","262645633_Significance_of_androgen_receptor_variants_in_castration_resistant_prostate_cancer","23679331_New_Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumours_revised_RECIST_guideline_version_11","23143981_Chen_Y_Sawyers_CL_Scher_HI_Targeting_the_androgen_receptor_pathway_in_prostate_cancer_Curr_Opin_Pharmacol_8_440-448","15678056_Rate_of_change_in_serum_prostate-specific_antigen_as_a_method_of_prostate_cancer_detection","15474982_Mutation_of_the_Androgen-Receptor_Gene_in_Metastatic_Androgen-Independent_Prostate_Cancer","12908988_Functional_reassessment_of_P16_variants_using_a_transfection-based_assay"]}
