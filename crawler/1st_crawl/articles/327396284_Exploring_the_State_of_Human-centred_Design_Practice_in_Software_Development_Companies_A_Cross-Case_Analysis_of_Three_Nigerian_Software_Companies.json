{"id":"327396284_Exploring_the_State_of_Human-centred_Design_Practice_in_Software_Development_Companies_A_Cross-Case_Analysis_of_Three_Nigerian_Software_Companies","abstract":"It is commonly believed that human-centred design (HCD) approach is very beneficial to interactive systems development. However, not much is known about the state of HCD practice in developing countries, especially the sub-Saharan Africa. This paper explores the state of HCD practice in three Nigerian software companies. We used the interview technique to explore two key issues. First, the perception of humans as a component of sociotechnical systems, and second, how HCD process is being approached in software companies. A cross-case analysis of the three companies was performed and the usability maturity model-human-centredness scale was used to determine the state of maturity of the three companies. The outcomes of this study reveal that HCD practice is currently at the least stage of maturity in the three companies and user involvement is not practiced in the right manner. The outcomes of the study suggest the need for reflective HCD practice and localizing humanâ€“computer interaction approaches to contexts.","authors":["Abiodun Ogunyemi","David Lamas","Emmanuel Eze"],"meta":["September 2018Interacting with Computers","DOI:10.1093/iwc/iwy020","Project: Development of a HCI maturity self-assessment tool"],"references":["334614914_A_Profile_of_Nigeria's_Software_Industry","328562402_Identifying_HCI_approaches_to_support_CMMI-DEV_for_interactive_system_development","303773101_STRATUS_a_questionnaire_for_strategic_usability_assessment","351576272_Causes_of_SoftwareInformation_Technology_Project_Failures_In_Nigerian_Software_Development_Organizations","321572954_Human-Computer_Interaction_-_INTERACT_2015_15th_IFIP_TC_13_International_Conference_Bamberg_Germany_September_14-18_2015_Proceedings_Part_II","317638928_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Usability_CapabilityMaturity_Models","312624546_Do_Staged_Maturity_Models_Result_in_Organization-Wide_Continuous_Process_Improvement_Insight_from_Employees","303323831_Usability_challenges_in_an_Ethiopian_software_development_organization","301450548_Teaching_Software_Developers_to_Perform_UX_Tasks","292488898_Content_Prototyping_-_An_Approach_for_Engaging_Non-technical_Users_in_Participatory_Design"]}
