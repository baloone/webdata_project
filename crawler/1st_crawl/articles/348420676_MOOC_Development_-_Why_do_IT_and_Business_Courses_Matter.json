{"id":"348420676_MOOC_Development_-_Why_do_IT_and_Business_Courses_Matter","abstract":"MOOCs (massive open online courses) were initially developed in 2012. Since then, their design and structure have evolved. Different fields of MOOCs are developed with different dynamics. Customers find MOOCs in two primary ways. The first are courses found via search, a segment in which computer science and business courses dominate. The second are additional courses, recommended by the online platforms. The overall number of participants taking these courses is higher. There are three categories of courses within this group: humanities, business, and health & medicine. Therefore, future development of MOOCs are interconnected with these categories more then with the others.","authors":["Sergei Kruchinin","Ekaterina Bagrova"],"meta":["January 2021SHS Web of Conferences 93:01008","DOI:10.1051/shsconf/20219301008"],"references":["328647308_Progress_and_new_directions_for_teaching_and_learning_in_MOOCs","321160485_Student_success_prediction_in_MOOCs","319133380_Trends_and_Patterns_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_Review_and_Content_Analysis_of_Research_on_MOOCs_2008-2015","304627020_From_massive_access_to_cooperation_lessons_learned_and_proven_results_of_a_hybrid_xMOOCcMOOC_pedagogical_approach_to_MOOCs","323997718_Competition_among_schools_and_educational_quality_Tension_between_various_objectives_of_educational_policy","323381893_Learning_Engagement_and_Persistence_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCS","298730870_A_Nephrology_Fellows'_Communication_Skills_Course_An_Educational_Quality_Improvement_Report"]}
