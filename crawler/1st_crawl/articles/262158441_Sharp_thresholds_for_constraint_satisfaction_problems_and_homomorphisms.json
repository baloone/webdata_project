{"id":"262158441_Sharp_thresholds_for_constraint_satisfaction_problems_and_homomorphisms","abstract":"We determine under which conditions certain natural models of random constraint satisfaction problems have sharp thresholds of satisfiability. These models include graph and hypergraph homomorphism, the (d,k,t)-model, and binary constraint satisfaction problems with domain size three. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
