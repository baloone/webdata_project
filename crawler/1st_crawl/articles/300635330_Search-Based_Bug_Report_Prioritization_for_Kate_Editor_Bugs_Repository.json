{"id":"300635330_Search-Based_Bug_Report_Prioritization_for_Kate_Editor_Bugs_Repository","abstract":"The prioritization of bugs in online repositories can be considered a complex and important task. Thus, providing an automatic strategy to deal with this challenge can be useful and significantly collaborate with the repository use. In this paper, a search-based approach to prioritize bugs in the Kate Editor Bugs Repository is proposed, taking into account some valuable information given by the repository users about the bugs. Experiments demonstrate the proposed approach can be calibrated to fit particular scenarios and can produce intelligent bug orders.","authors":["Duany Dreyton","Allysson Allex Araújo","Altino Dantas","Átila Freitas"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22183-0_26","Conference: International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering"],"references":["273328605_An_approach_to_prioritize_code_smells_for_refactoring","257680560_Bug_Prioritization_to_Facilitate_Bug_Report_Triage","229044698_Managing_Open_Bug_Repositories_through_Bug_Report_Prioritization_Using_SVMs","221554685_Who_should_fix_this_bug","221051156_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_Techniques_Taxonomy_Tutorial","4250869_The_Current_State_and_Future_of_Search_Based_Software_Engineering","259543154_A_Hitchhiker's_guide_to_statistical_tests_for_assessing_randomized_algorithms_in_software_engineering","236134145_Interactive_Requirements_Prioritization_using_a_Genetic_Algorithm","220291960_JMetal_A_Java_framework_for_multi-objective_optimization"]}
