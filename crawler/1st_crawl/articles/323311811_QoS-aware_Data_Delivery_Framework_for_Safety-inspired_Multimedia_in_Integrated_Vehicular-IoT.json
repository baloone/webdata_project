{"id":"323311811_QoS-aware_Data_Delivery_Framework_for_Safety-inspired_Multimedia_in_Integrated_Vehicular-IoT","abstract":"This work considers the development of a hybrid sensor and vehicular network that provides safety supports in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our main interest is the emergency situations in a smart-city and its facilities during and/or after disasters such as earthquakes and severe car collisions where unsafe road segments are often found. We propose agile framework that caters for service-based applications in smart cities where multimedia data is heavily exchanged. Optimized data delivery approach that operates with limited resources in highly dynamic topologies is investigated and proposed. We also propose a solid mathematical model for data packets routing-determination methods. The proposed model assists in utilizing the available vehiclesâ€™ resources in data routing while maintaining Quality of Service in a variety of multimedia security and safety applications. We use solid analytical analysis to verify the simulation results in terms of packet received ratio, energy consumption, and average end-to-end delay, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model.","authors":["Fadi Al-Turjman"],"meta":["February 2018Computer Communications 121","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2018.02.012"],"references":["284273736_A_Stochastic_Geometry_Model_for_Multi-Hop_Highway_Vehicular_Communication","317130546_Price-based_data_delivery_framework_for_dynamic_and_pervasive_IoT","311086582_Vehicle_Public_Safety_System_Design_and_Implementation","309626209_Value_of_information_based_scheduling_of_cloud_computing_resources","305417451_Wireless_access_technologies_for_vehicular_network_safety_applications","280102415_Cloud-Assisted_Safety_Message_Dissemination_in_VANET-Cellular_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Network"]}
