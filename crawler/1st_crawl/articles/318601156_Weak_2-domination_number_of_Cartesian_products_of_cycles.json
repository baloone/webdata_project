{"id":"318601156_Weak_2-domination_number_of_Cartesian_products_of_cycles","abstract":"For a graph \\(G=(V, E)\\), a weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-dominating function \\(f:V\\rightarrow \\{0,1,2\\}\\) has the property that \\(\\sum _{u\\in N(v)}f(u)\\ge 2\\) for every vertex \\(v\\in V\\) with \\(f(v)= 0\\), where N(v) is the set of neighbors of v in G. The weight of a weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-dominating function f is the sum \\(\\sum _{v\\in V}f(v)\\) and the minimum weight of a weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-dominating function is the weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-domination number. In this paper, we introduce a discharging approach and provide a short proof for the lower bound of the weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-domination number of \\(C_n \\Box C_5\\), which was obtained by Stȩpień, et al. (Discrete Appl Math 170:113–116, 2014). Moreover, we obtain the weak \\(\\{2\\}\\)-domination numbers of \\(C_n \\Box C_3\\) and \\(C_n \\Box C_4\\).","authors":["Zepeng Li","Zehui Shao","Jin Xu"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 35(17)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-017-0157-6"],"references":["282622655_On_dominating_sets_of_maximal_outerplanar_and_planar_graphs","271044951_The_Cartesian_product_of_cycles_with_small_2-rainbow_domination_number","267046484_Improved_Upper_Bounds_on_the_Domination_Number_of_Graphs_With_Minimum_Degree_at_Least_Five","265574151_Rainbow_domination_in_graphs","257586228_2-Rainbow_domination_number_of_Cartesian_products_C_nsquare_C_3_and_C_nsquare_C_5","286756680_Roman_2-domination","262316243_On_rainbow_domination_numbers_of_graphs","260803390_2-Rainbow_domination_number_of_CnC5CnC5","257299510_Bounds_on_the_2-Rainbow_Domination_Number_of_Graphs","257000797_A_tight_upper_bound_for_2-rainbow_domination_in_generalized_Petersen_graphs"]}
