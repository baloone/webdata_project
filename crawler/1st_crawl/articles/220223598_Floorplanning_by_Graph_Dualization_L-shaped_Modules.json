{"id":"220223598_Floorplanning_by_Graph_Dualization_L-shaped_Modules","abstract":"We propose a novel technique for constructing a floorplan from an adjacency requirement â€” represented by a graphG. The algorithm finds a geometric dual ofG involving both rectangular and L-shaped modules. This is the first dualization technique which permits L-shaped modules. We can test inO(n\n3/2) time ifG admits an L-shaped dual and construct one, if it exists, inO(n\n2) time, wheren is the number of modules.","authors":["Richard Sun","Majid Sarrafzadeh"],"meta":["December 1993Algorithmica 10(6):429-456","DOI:10.1007/BF01891831","SourceDBLP"],"references":["227036577_A_linear_algorithm_to_find_a_rectangular_dual_of_a_planar_triangulated_graph","220618165_Finding_a_Minimum_Circuit_in_a_Graph","243786892_An_Algorithm_to_Eliminate_All_Complex_Triangles_in_a_Maximal_Planar_Graph_for_Use_in_VLSI_Floorplanning","229650900_Rectangular_duals_of_planar_graphs","229605857_On_the_number_of_cycles_of_length_k_in_a_maximal_planar_graph","227824199_Graphs_in_floor-plan_design","227645984_A_linear_algorithm_to_check_for_the_existence_of_a_rectangular_dual_of_a_planar_triangulated_graph","224582875_An_Algorithm_for_Path_Connections_and_Its_Applications","220224640_Floorplan_design_of_VLSI_circuits","4218682_A_Linear_Algorithm_to_Find_a_Rectangular_Dual_of_a_Planar_Triangulated","3222888_Algorithms_for_Floorplan_Design_Via_Rectangular_Dualization","3183733_Rectangular_dualization_and_rectangular_dissections"]}
