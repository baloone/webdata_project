{"id":"255061722_Multiple_Intelligences_the_Mozart_Effect_and_Emotional_Intelligence_A_Critical_Review","abstract":"This article reviews evidence for multiple intelligences theory, the Mozart effect theory, and emotional intelligence theory and argues that despite their wide currency in education these theories lack adequate empirical support and should not be the basis for educational practice. Each theory is compared to theory counterparts in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuro- science that have better empirical support. The article considers possible reasons for the appeal of these 3 theories and concludes with a brief rationale for examining theories of cognition in the light of cognitive neuroscience research findings.","authors":["Lynn Waterhouse"],"meta":["December 2006Educational Psychologist 41(4):207-225","DOI:10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1"],"references":["325746710_Brain_and_cognitive_evolution_Forms_of_modularity_and_functions_of_mind","344083240_Mozart_and_the_Mind","329651841_Emotional_Intelligence_Science_and_Myth","329650966_How_the_Mind_Explains_Behavior_Folk_Explanations_Meaning_and_Social_Interaction","323285761_Inequality_and_education_Implications_for_the_psychologist","318299769_Fostering_Social-Emotional_Learning_in_the_Classroom","318285369_Fostering_Social-Emotional_Learning_in_the_Classroom","299066229_The_theory_of_multiple_intelligences_A_case_of_missing_cognitive_matter_-_Response_to_Nicholas_Allix","291717787_Making_a_better_argument","289963658_Just_one_g_Consistent_results_from_three_test_batteries"]}
