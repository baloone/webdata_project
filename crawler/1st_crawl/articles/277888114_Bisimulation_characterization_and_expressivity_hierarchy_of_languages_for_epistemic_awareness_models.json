{"id":"277888114_Bisimulation_characterization_and_expressivity_hierarchy_of_languages_for_epistemic_awareness_models","abstract":"The present work studies the expressivity hierarchy of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ languages over epistemic awareness models by characterizing each language's expressivity with its adequate notion of bisimulation. The studied ‘static’ languages are based on the operators for implicit and explicit knowledge, implicit and explicit possibility and awareness; the studied ‘dynamic’ languages extend the ‘static’ ones with operators that express the effect of the so-called epistemic awareness action models, structures that can represent changes in an agent's knowledge and awareness.","authors":["Fernando R.
