Indeed, a plethora of models exist explaining influential factors and mechanisms of technology use in classrooms, one of which—the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and versions thereof—has dominated the field. Although consensus exists about which factors in the TAM might predict teachers’ technology adoption, the current field abounds in some controversies and inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis seeks to clarify some of these issues by combining meta-analysis with structural equation modeling approaches. Specifically, we synthesized 124 correlation matrices from 114 empirical TAM studies (N = 34,357 teachers) and tested the fit of the TAM and its versions. Overall, the TAM explains technology acceptance well; yet, the role of certain key constructs and the importance of external variables contrast some existing beliefs about the TAM. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\n\n50 days' free access to the article:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/authShare/S0360131518302458/20180922T060800Z/1?md5=8d2c1df052d2f4f18019d1d39d479a27&dgcid=coauthor","authors":["Ronny Scherer","Fazilat Siddiq","Jo Tondeur"],"meta":["September 2018Computers & Education","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.009"],"references":["324206212_A_review_of_technology_acceptance_and_adoption_models_and_theories","315633980_Toward_an_Understanding_of_Preservice_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_Teachers'_Acceptance_of_Computer-Assisted_Language_Learning_20_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China","313548239_The_relationship_among_pre-service_teachers_computer_competence_attitude_towards_computer-assisted_education_and_intention_of_technology_acceptance","325661702_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_M-learning_context_A_systematic_review","320859652_The_importance_of_attitudes_toward_technology_for_pre-service_teachers'_technological_pedagogical_and_content_knowledge_Comparing_structural_equation_modeling_approaches","320596143_Introduction_to_meta-analysis","316603609_Interdisciplinary_Research_Agenda_in_Support_of_Assessment_of_Collaborative_Problem_Solving_Lessons_Learned_from_Developing_a_Collaborative_Science_Assessment_Prototype","315322285_The_structure_of_common_emotion_regulation_strategies_A_meta-analytic_examination","313558350_Understanding_Information_Technology_Usage_A_Test_of_Competing_Models","313513535_Goodness_of_fit_evaluation_in_structural_equation_modeling"]}
