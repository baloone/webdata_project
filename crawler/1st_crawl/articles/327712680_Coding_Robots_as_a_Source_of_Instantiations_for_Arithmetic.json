{"id":"327712680_Coding_Robots_as_a_Source_of_Instantiations_for_Arithmetic","abstract":"With louder and more widespread calls to include computer programming as a core element of school curriculum, global efforts to define innovative and distinct coding curricula are underway. We take a different tack in this paper, one oriented by an investigation of the common ground between learning to program and learning mathematics. We observed 9- and 10-year-olds as they learned to build and program Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots over 4 days, attending in particular to the ways that programming robots to move might support the development and integration of powerful instantiations of number, arithmetic and multiplication. Our findings suggest that childrenâ€™s understanding of number, and their transitions from additive to multiplicative thinking, can be powerfully supported by engaging in practical tasks rather than practice exercises.","authors":["Krista Francis","Brent Davis"],"meta":["December 2018Digital Experiences in Mathematics Education 4(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40751-018-0042-7"],"references":["326131625_Affordances_and_tensions_in_teaching_both_computational_thinking_and_mathematics","321760448_A_Scoping_Review_of_Studies_on_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Mathematics_Classrooms","347393997_Is_1_a_Prime_Number_Developing_Teacher_Knowledge_through_Concept_Study","333377982_Conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge_The_case_of_mathematics","330526030_The_Body_in_the_Mind_The_Bodily_Basis_of_Meaning_Imagination_and_Reason","322612124_The_Dynamic_Geometrisation_of_Computer_Programming","321704681_The_embodied_mind_Cognitive_science_and_human_experience","319393721_Where_Mathematics_Comes_From_How_the_Embodied_Mind_Brings_Mathematics_into_Being","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","317953572_Multiplicative_structures"]}
