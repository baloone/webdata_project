We determined if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of coupled slow-waves could distinguish between epileptogenic and physiological HFOs.\n\nMethods\nWe studied a consecutive series of 13 children with focal epilepsy who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography. We measured the occurrence rate of HFOs during slow-wave sleep at each electrode site. We subsequently determined the performance of HFO rate for localization of seizure-onset sites and undesirable detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites defined by neurostimulation. We likewise determined the predictive performance of modulation index: MI(XHz)&(YHz), reflecting the strength of coupling between amplitude of HFOsXHz and phase of slow-waveYHz. The predictive accuracy was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver-operating characteristics analysis.\n\nResults\nIncrease in HFO rate localized seizure-onset sites (AUC⩾0.72; p<0.001), but also undesirably detected nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩾0.58; p<0.001). Increase in MI(HFOs)&(3-4Hz) also detected both seizure-onset (AUC⩾0.74; p<0.001) and nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩾0.59; p<0.001). Increase in subtraction-MIHFOs [defined as subtraction of MI(HFOs)&(0.5-1Hz) from MI(HFOs)&(3-4Hz)] localized seizure-onset sites (AUC⩾0.71; p<0.001), but rather avoided detection of nonepileptic sensorimotor-visual sites (AUC⩽0.42; p<0.001).\n\nConclusion\nOur data suggest that epileptogenic HFOs may be coupled with slow-wave3-4Hz more preferentially than slow-wave0.5-1Hz, whereas physiologic HFOs with slow-wave0.5-1Hz more preferentially than slow-wave3-4Hz during slow-wave sleep.\n\nSignificance\nFurther studies in larger samples are warranted to determine if consideration of the spectral frequency bands of slow-waves coupled with HFOs can positively contribute to presurgical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy.","authors":["Yutaka Nonoda","Makoto Miyakoshi","Alejandro
