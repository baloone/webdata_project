{"id":"259996940_The_Adoption_of_Software_Measures_A_Technology_Acceptance_Model_TAM_Perspective","abstract":"The use of software measures for project management and software process improvement has been encouraged for many years. However, the low level of acceptance and use of software measures in practice has been a constant concern. In this paper we propose and test a model which explains and predicts the use of software measures. The model is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and operationalizes the perceived usefulness construct according to the “desirable properties of software measures.” Our research provides guidance for software engineers in selecting among different software measures and for software metrics coordinators who are planning measurement programs.","authors":["Linda Wallace","Steven Sheetz"],"meta":["March 2014Information & Management 51(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.im.2013.12.003"],"references":["311644620_Structural_equation_modeling_and_regression_guidelines_for_research_practice","290392761_Financial_incentives_personal_information_and_drop-out_in_online_studies","345655747_Principles_of_Research_in_Behavioral_Science","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312613995_On_the_Evaluation_of_Structural_Equation_Models","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","288891518_The_lines_of_code_alternative","288008909_Measuring_rigor_and_putting_measurement_into_action","287651935_Development_of_an_instrument_to_measure_perceptions_of_adoption_of_an_information_technology_innovations"]}
