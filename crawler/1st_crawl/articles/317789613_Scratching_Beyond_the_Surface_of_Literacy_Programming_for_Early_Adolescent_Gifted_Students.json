{"id":"317789613_Scratching_Beyond_the_Surface_of_Literacy_Programming_for_Early_Adolescent_Gifted_Students","abstract":"Digital technology offers new possibilities for children to play, express themselves, learn, and communicate. A recent development in online practice is a shift toward youth engaged in computer programming online communities. Programming is argued to be the new literacy of the millennium. In this article, I examine the use of Scratch, an online programming community, as a means to support digital literacy for early adolescent gifted, talented, and creative students. In addition, I share the experiences of an early adolescent gifted student with Scratch and consider the use of Scratch to promote interdisciplinary curricular concepts.","authors":["Julia Hagge"],"meta":["July 2017Gifted Child Today 40(3):154-162","DOI:10.1177/1076217517707233"],"references":["313384122_You_Can_Teach_Old_Dogs_New_Tricks_The_Factors_That_Affect_Changes_over_Time_in_Digital_Literacy","305425858_Computational_Participation_Understanding_Coding_as_an_Extension_of_Literacy_Instruction","292879614_Guest_editorial_-_navigating_in_the_digital_era_Digital_literacy_Socio-cultural_and_educational_aspects","289502044_Computational_Participation","279558304_Reading_comprehension_on_the_Internet_Expanding_our_understanding_of_reading_comprehension_to_encompass_new_literacies","249909626_From_SuperGoo_to_Scratch_Exploring_creative_digital_media_production_in_informal_learning","242352947_Multiliteracies_New_Literacies_New_Learning","234831832_Alice_Greenfoot_and_Scratch_-_A_Discussion","234820368_The_Scratch_Programming_Language_and_Environment","234649601_Multimodality_and_Literacy_in_School_Classrooms","230881748_The_Markings_of_a_New_Pencil_Introducing_Programming-as-Writing_in_the_Middle_School_Classroom","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","286518343_Educational_computer_games_and_learning_The_relationship_between_designcognitive_load_emotions_and_outcomes","286254753_From_Bits_and_Bytes_to_C_and_Web_Sites_What_is_Computer_Talent_Made_of","284662570_Scratch_Multimedia_Programming_Environment_for_Young_Gifted_Learners","283459956_Using_Coding_Apps_to_Support_Literacy_Instruction_and_Develop_Coding_Literacy","279534704_'I'm_Making_it_Different_to_the_Book'_Transmediation_in_Young_Children's_Multimodal_and_Digital_Texts","275437064_Technology_Student_Animation_Projects_An_Avenue_to_Promote_Creativity_and_Learning","273831070_Bringing_the_world_to_school_Integrating_news_and_media_literacy_in_elementary_classrooms","268746739_Childhood_Giftedness_Adolescent_Agency_A_Systemic_Multiple-Case_Study","258137939_Multiliteracies_Theory_and_Gifted_Education_Creating_Smart_Spaces_in_the_Language_Arts_Classroom","258137938_A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events_The_Repercussions_of_Print-Literacy_as_the_Only_Literacy_for_Talented_Boys","258137917_Innovative_Allies_Spatial_and_Creative_Abilities","257171684_Empowering_students_through_digital_game_authorship_Enhancing_concentration_critical_thinking_and_academic_achievement","254120455_Beyond_the_Classroom_Walls_Teachers'_and_Students'_Perspectives_on_How_Online_Learning_Can_Meet_the_Needs_of_Gifted_Students","250216590_Adolescent_development_from_an_agentic_perspective","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice","240729739_Five_Readers_Browsing_The_Reading_Interests_of_Talented_Middle_School_Boys","234144073_Cognitive_Surplus_Creativity_and_Generosity_in_a_Connected_Age","232835975_New_learning_A_charter_for_change_in_education_1","220094537_Machines_for_Thinking","49761166_Making_projects_making_friends_Online_community_as_catalyst_for_interactive_media_creation","49761163_Content_creation_in_virtual_worlds_to_support_adolescent_identity_development"]}
