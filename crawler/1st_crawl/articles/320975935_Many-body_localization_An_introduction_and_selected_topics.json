{"id":"320975935_Many-body_localization_An_introduction_and_selected_topics","abstract":"What happens in an isolated quantum system when both disorder and interactions are present? Over the recent years, the picture of a non-thermalizing phase of matter, the many-localized phase, has emerged as a stable solution. We present a basic introduction to the topic of many-body localization, using the simple example of a quantum spin chain which allows us to illustrate several of the properties of this phase. We then briefly review the current experimental research efforts probing this physics. The largest part of this review is a selection of more specialized questions, some of which are currently under active investigation. We conclude by summarizing the connections between many-body localization and quantum simulations.","authors":["Fabien Alet","Nicolas Laflorencie"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1016/j.crhy.2018.03.003"],"references":["317163812_Recent_progress_in_many-body_localization","317140825_Local_integrals_of_motion_in_many-body_localized_systems","313044640_Equilibration_and_Order_in_Quantum_Floquet_Matter","310838666_Many_body_localized_systems_weakly_coupled_to_baths","309551481_The_Ergodic_Side_of_the_Many-Body_Localization_Transition","309460921_Observation_of_discrete_time-crystalline_order_in_a_disordered_dipolar_many-body_system","309317312_Many-body_localization_and_delocalization_from_the_perspective_of_Integrals_of_Motion","308883654_Localization_and_chaos_in_a_spin_glass_model_with_random_fields_Mapping_to_the_localization_problem_in_a_Bethe_lattice_with_a_correlated_disorder","308716434_Observation_of_a_Discrete_Time_Crystal","307536764_Measuring_out-of-time-order_correlations_and_multiple_quantum_spectra_in_a_trapped_ion_quantum_magnet"]}
