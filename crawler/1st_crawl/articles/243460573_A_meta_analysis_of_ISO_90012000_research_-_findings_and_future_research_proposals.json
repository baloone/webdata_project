{"id":"243460573_A_meta_analysis_of_ISO_90012000_research_-_findings_and_future_research_proposals","abstract":"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review and classify the main findings of the studies undertaken on ISO 9001:2000 certified companies and to present future research proposals. Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review is carried out focusing on research papers published in academic literature. Both, the most recently published papers as well as those concerned only with the 2000 version of the ISO 9001 standard are chosen. The findings from the research papers are classified according to the issues examined. Findings – The many studies undertaken regarding the ISO 9001:2000 implementation show that although there are signs that the initial results are not so positive, the general conclusion is that the standard has positive impact on the company's operational as well as business performance and on the company's effort to move towards total quality management. However, many research proposals have been expressed in order to fully determine the long-term results as well as to specify a valid model containing the fundamental quality management practices which can effectively drive a company to business excellence. Practical implications – Having in mind that the ISO 9001:2000 is getting to its end and a new revised standard is being given birth (ISO 9001:2008); the paper reveals that the research agenda is still full of topics that have to be considered in order to fully understand the standard's implications. Hence, given the findings from the researches carried out until now and the modifications made to the requirements of the new standard, this paper gives directions for effective transition to the revised standard as well as for future research studies. Originality/value – Reviewing the literature, it is observed that many research papers regarding the ISO 9001:2000 standard have already been published. This paper classifies the research findings and points out future research proposals in order to fully explore the quality management discipline.","authors":["Evangelos Psomas","Christos V.
