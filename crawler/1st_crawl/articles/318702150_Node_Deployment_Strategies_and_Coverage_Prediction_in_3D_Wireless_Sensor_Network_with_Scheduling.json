{"id":"318702150_Node_Deployment_Strategies_and_Coverage_Prediction_in_3D_Wireless_Sensor_Network_with_Scheduling","abstract":"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network of spatially distributed autonomous devices using sensors to monitor physical conditions. Deployment of sensor nodes is a critical issue in WSN as it affects coverage and connectivity of the network. Coverage in wireless sensor networks is a measure of how well and for how long the sensors are able to observe the physical space. In this paper, we propose different sensor node deployment strategies for 3D WSN for maximum coverage prediction. We do a comparative study of 3D sensor node deployment strategies for coverage prediction. We also propose a scheduling algorithm to minimize the number of sensor nodes used in coverage prediction. Our study also gives a comparison between various proposed 3D sensor node deployment schemes along with the number of sensor nodes to be used in each case.","authors":["Anvesha Katti","Daya Krishan Lobiyal"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["258703663_Sensing_Coverage_Prediction_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_in_Shadowed_and_Multipath_Environment","224760490_Impact_of_Heterogeneity_on_Coverage_and_Broadcast_Reachability_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221628557_On_Deriving_the_Upper_Bound_of_a-Lifetime_for_Large_Sensor_Networks","310832543_Sensor_node_deployment_and_coverage_prediction_for_underwater_sensor_networks","309912347_A_Study_of_Wireless_Mobile_Sensor_Network_Deployment","278680684_Coverage_Connectivity_and_Deployment_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","262150718_Classification_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Deployment_Techniques","260111303_Ant_colony_optimization_with_greedy_migration_mechanism_for_node_deployment_in_wireless_sensor_networks","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","221258393_Fuzzy-Based_Movement-Assisted_Sensor_Deployment_Method_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
