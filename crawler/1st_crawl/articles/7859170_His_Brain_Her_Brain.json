{"id":"7859170_His_Brain_Her_Brain","abstract":"Medical researchers have found that male and female brains differ a bit in architecture and activity and research into these variations could lead to sex-specific treatments for disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In many cases, sex differences in the brain's chemistry and construction influence how males and females respond to the environment or react to and remember stressful events. Several intriguing behavioral studies add to the evidence that some sex differences in the brain arise before a baby draws its first breath. Neuroscientists are continuing to identify all the sex-related variations in the brain and pinpointing their influences on cognition and propensity for brain-related disorders.","authors":["Larry Cahill"],"meta":["June 2005Scientific American 292(5):40-7","DOI:10.1038/scientificamericanmind0509-40","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
