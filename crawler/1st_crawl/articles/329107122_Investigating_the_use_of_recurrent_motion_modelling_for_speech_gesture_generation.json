{"id":"329107122_Investigating_the_use_of_recurrent_motion_modelling_for_speech_gesture_generation","abstract":"The growing use of virtual humans demands generating increasingly realistic behavior for them while minimizing cost and time. Gestures are a key ingredient for realistic and engaging virtual agents and consequently automatized gesture generation has been a popular area of research. So far, good gesture generation has relied on explicit formulation of if-then rules and probabilistic modelling of annotated features. Machine learning approaches have yielded only marginal success, indicating a high complexity of the speech-to-motion learning task. In this work, we explore the use of transfer learning using previous motion modelling research to improve learning outcomes for gesture generation from speech. We use a recurrent network with an encoder-decoder structure that takes in prosodic speech features and generates a short sequence of gesture motion. We pre-train the network with a motion modelling task. We recorded a large multimodal database of conversational speech for the purpose of this work.","authors":["Ylva Ferstl","Rachel McDonnell"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1145/3267851.3267898","Conference: the 18th International Conference"],"references":["324961229_Deep_CNNs_for_microscopic_image_classification_by_exploiting_transfer_learning_and_feature_concatenation","320968377_On_Human_Motion_Prediction_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","320435956_Speech-to-Gesture_Generation_A_Challenge_in_Deep_Learning_Approach_with_Bi-Directional_LSTM","316779623_On_human_motion_prediction_using_recurrent_neural_networks","298281143_Deep_Learning_for_Emotion_Recognition_on_Small_Datasets_Using_Transfer_Learning","278025845_SimSensei_Kiosk_A_Virtual_Human_Interviewer_for_Healthcare_Decision_Support","271740290_Head_motion_synthesis_from_speech_using_deep_neural_networks","261153438_Recent_advances_in_deep_learning_for_speech_research_at_Microsoft","257352947_Modeling_the_Semantic_Coordination_of_Speech_and_Gesture_under_Cognitive_and_Linguistic_Constraints","256663200_Gesture_Controllers","251238209_TTS-Driven_Synthetic_Behaviour-Generation_Model_for_Artificial_Bodies","238717142_Virtual_Character_Performance_From_Speech","233551129_A_Primary_Role_for_Nonverbal_Communication_in_Psychoanalysis","231181019_Seeing_is_Believing_Body_Motion_Dominates_in_Multisensory_Conversations","225743155_Ada_and_Grace_Toward_Realistic_and_Engaging_Virtual_Museum_Guides","224256281_A_friendly_gesture_Investigating_the_effect_of_multimodal_robot_behavior_in_human-robot_interaction","221588473_GNetIc_-_Using_Bayesian_Decision_Networks_for_Iconic_Gesture_Generation","221588153_How_to_Train_Your_Avatar_A_Data_Driven_Approach_to_Gesture_Generation","221489926_Recurrent_neural_network_based_language_model","221456205_Increasing_the_expressiveness_of_virtual_agents_Autonomous_generation_of_speech_and_gesture_for_spatial_description_tasks","221454956_SmartBody_Behavior_realization_for_embodied_conversational_agents","215439325_Speech-Gesture_Mismatches_Evidence_for_One_Underlying_Representation_of_Linguistic_and_Nonlinguistic_Information","37688404_Hand_and_Mind_What_Gestures_Reveal_About_Thought","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319294180_Predicting_Head_Pose_in_Dyadic_Conversation","318780069_Real-Time_Prosody-Driven_Synthesis_of_Body_Language","311990793_Transfer_Learning_for_Low-Resource_Neural_Machine_Translation","311609799_Structural-RNN_Deep_Learning_on_Spatio-Temporal_Graphs","309181152_Multimodal_Analysis_of_Speech_and_Arm_Motion_for_Prosody-Driven_Synthesis_of_Beat_Gestures","304409500_Recurrent_Network_Models_for_Human_Dynamics","287786846_Gesture_generation_with_low-dimensional_embeddings","284219934_Structural-RNN_Deep_Learning_on_Spatio-Temporal_Graphs","270878065_A_Recursive_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","262174935_Recent_developments_in_openSMILE_the_Munich_open-source_multimedia_feature_extractor","220183542_HP_Gesture_modeling_and_animation_based_on_a_probabilistic_re-creation_of_speaker_style","12770422_The_role_of_gesture_in_communication_and_thinking"]}
