{"id":"282819483_Hyperdecidability_of_pseudovarieties_of_orthogroups","abstract":"Let W denote the intersection with the pseudovariety of completely regular semigroups of the Mal'cev product of the pseudovariety of bands with a pseudovariety V of completely regular semigroups. It is shown that the (pseudo)-word problem for W is reduced to that for V in such a way that decidability is preserved in the case in which terms involving only multiplication and weak inversion are considered. It is also shown that, if V is a hyperdecidable (respectively canonically reducible) pseudovariety of groups, then so is W.","authors":["Jorge Almeida","P.G.
