{"id":"336762496_Time-to-Collision-Based_Awareness_and_Congestion_Control_for_Vehicular_Communications","abstract":"Vehicular wireless communications require both congestion control to guarantee the availability of a fraction of the bandwidth for safety-related event-driven messages in emergency cases, and awareness control to adapt the beaconing activity to the application needs and surrounding traffic situation. Most current approaches either ignore the traffic situation and only adapt the beaconing rate to the channel congestion state or override the congestion control limits, leading to questionable results in both cases. In this paper, we conceive and validate a novel approach, combining both aspects. Based on distributed Network UtilityMaximization (NUM), our algorithm satisfies the constraints on channel availability, whereas the safety of the surrounding traffic situation is captured with a time-to-collision metric, used to assign priorities in the optimal allocation problem. The performance of the proposed approach is validated and compared to other popular algorithms. Results show that our proposal automatically anticipates a potential increase in rate due to a critical safety situation, but does not interfere with the reserved bandwidth for safety applications.","authors":["Juan Aznar-Poveda","Esteban Egea-Lopez","Antonio-Javier Garcia-Sanchez","Pablo Pavon-Marino"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE Access 7:1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949131"],"references":["334343375_Fair_and_stable_joint_beacon_frequency_and_power_control_for_connected_vehicles","329114911_Coordination_of_Congestion_and_Awareness_Control_in_Vehicular_Networks","321262772_Cooperative_awareness_in_VANETs_On_ETSI_EN_302_637-2_performance","319225121_Non-cooperative_Beacon_Rate_and_Awareness_Control_for_VANETs","316443636_Why_6_Mbps_is_Not_Always_the_Optimum_Data_Rate_for_Beaconing_in_Vehicular_Networks","334071268_Risk_Controlled_Beacon_Transmission_in_V2V_Communications","326047098_ABC_Adaptive_Beacon_Control_for_Rear-End_Collision_Avoidance_in_VANETs","324471965_Control_of_Connected_and_Automated_Vehicles_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Challenges","321785384_Mobility-Adaptive_Beacon_Broadcast_for_Vehicular_Cooperative_Safety-Critical_Applications","308846343_Evaluation_of_an_awareness_control_algorithm_for_VANETs_based_on_ETSI_EN_302_637-2_V132"]}
