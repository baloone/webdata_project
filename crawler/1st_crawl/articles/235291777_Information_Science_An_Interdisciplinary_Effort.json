{"id":"235291777_Information_Science_An_Interdisciplinary_Effort","abstract":"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of collaboration within information science, to argue for distinct meanings for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research and to answer two questions: What philosophic distinction can be made between inter- and multi-disciplinary efforts? Is one more valuable than the other to information science research? Design/methodology/approach – The semantic inconsistency for describing collaboration is identified in information science. Philosophic analysis of the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary is conducted, arguing for distinct meanings. A case study through cognitive science exploring the philosophic meanings is developed. Findings – Interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity are very distinct in terms of methods and frameworks. Interdisciplinary research has longer-term benefits for information science, but multidisciplinary research can also fulfil valid collaborative roles in information science. Research limitations/implications – A brief technical discussion of cognitive science theory lends itself to those interested in cognitive science. The paper is philosophic in nature. Practical implications – The inconsistencies surrounding the terms interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary have impact on professional practice. The argument for more consistent terminology will introduce more semantic integrity and reduce miscommunication. There is a challenge to engage in more interdisciplinary research and practice within information science. Originality/value – Collaboration is a common term used, but little research into what it precisely means within information science has been conducted. The paper argues for a clear distinction between various types of collaboration, and provides a case study with cognitive science.","authors":["George Adam Holland"],"meta":["January 2008Journal of Documentation 64(1):7-23","DOI:10.1108/00220410810844132"],"references":["291759922_A_survey_of_digital_library_education","267939164_Disciplinary_Multidisciplinary_Interdisciplinary_-Concepts_and_Indicators","260676399_Advancing_Interdisciplinary_Studies","254354770_Interdisciplinarity_an_Emergent_or_Engineered_Process","252145525_Computational_Science_Demands_a_New_Paradigm","249366208_Isms'_in_information_science_Constructivism_collectivism_and_constructionism","232441743_The_Characteristics_of_Subject_Matter_in_Different_Academic_Areas","220364862_A_quantitative_view_on_the_coming_of_age_of_interdisciplinarity_in_the_sciences_1980-1999_Scientometrics_581183-189_doihttpdxdoiorg101023A1025439910278DOI_101023A1025439910278","32961623_Interdisciplinary_Needs_The_Current_Context","32956254_Cybersemiotics_and_the_Problems_of_the_Information-Processing_Paradigm_as_a_Candidate_for_a_Unified_Science_of_Information_Behind_Library_Information_Science","28762416_The_third_contender_A_critical_examination_of_the_Dynamicist_theory_of_cognition","12031867_A_connectionist_theory_of_phenomenal_experience","2484261_An_Emerging_View_of_Scientific_Collaboration_Scientists'_Perspectives_on_Collaboration_and_Factors_that_Impact_Collaboration","297636244_Literary_studies_and_cognitive_science_Toward_a_new_interdisciplinarity","291300510_Disciplines_and_interdisciplinarity_A_historical_perspective","289882046_Specialization_and_Recombination_of_Specialties_in_the_Social_Sciences","286493269_Rethinking_Development_Geographies","284612452_Cognitive_research_in_information_science_Implications_for_design","248326076_Advancing_the_Social_Sciences_Through_the_Interdisciplinary_Enterprise","245155248_Academic_tribes_and_territories","243778265_The_cognitive_viewpoint_in_information_science","243766139_Mind_as_Motion_Explo-rations_in_the_Dynamics_of_Cognition","238665653_Varieties_of_interdisciplinary_approaches_in_the_social_sciences_A_1981_overview","232539249_The_cognitive_viewpoint_Its_development_and_its_scope","229673027_Interdisciplinary_collaboration_An_ongoing_community_narrative","228892775_New_theoretical_approaches_for_HCI","227127777_Fragmentation_and_recombination_of_the_social_sciences","222766094_Library_and_information_science_Practice_theory_and_philosophical_basis","220480411_Multidisciplinarity_and_cognitive_science","220434400_Epistemology_and_the_Socio-Cognitive_Perspective_in_Information_Science","220434129_Cognitive_space_and_information_space","220273672_Interdisciplinarity_The_Road_Ahead_for_Education_in_Digital_Libraries","220230803_Production_of_context'_in_information_seeking_research_A_metatheoretical_view","200855526_Local_Knowledge_Further_Essays_In_Interpretive_Anthropology","42794601_New_Theoretical_Approaches_for_Human-Computer_Interaction","32961638_The_Hybridization_of_Social_Science_Knowledge","32961630_Interdisciplinary_Research_and_Information_Overload","32956262_Arguments_for_Philosophical_Realism_in_Library_and_Information_Science","28762412_The_Extended_Mind","15454408_Nursing_as_an_emerging_academic_discipline","8884340_Science_at_the_Leading_Edge"]}
