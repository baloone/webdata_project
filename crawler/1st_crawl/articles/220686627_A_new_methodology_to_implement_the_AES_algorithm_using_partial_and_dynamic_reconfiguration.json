{"id":"220686627_A_new_methodology_to_implement_the_AES_algorithm_using_partial_and_dynamic_reconfiguration","abstract":"Wireless networks are very widespread nowadays, so secure and fast cryptographic algorithms are needed. The most widely used security technology in wireless computer networks is WPA2, which employs the AES algorithm, a powerful and robust cryptographic algorithm. In order not to degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) of these networks, the encryption speed is very important, for which reason we have implemented the AES algorithm in an FPGA, taking advantage of the hardware characteristics and the software-like flexibility of these devices. In this paper, we propose our own methodology for doing an FPGA-based AES implementation. This methodology combines the use of three hardware languages (Handel-C, VHDL and JBits) with partial and dynamic reconfiguration, and a pipelined and parallel implementation. The same design methodology could be extended to other cryptographic algorithms. Thanks to all these improvements our pipelined and parallel implementation reaches a very high throughput (24.922Gb/s) and the best efficiency (throughput/area ratio) of all the related works found in the literature (6.97Mb/s per slice).","authors":["José M.
