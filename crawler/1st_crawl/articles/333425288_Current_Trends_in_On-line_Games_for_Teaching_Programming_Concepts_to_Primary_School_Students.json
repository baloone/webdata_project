{"id":"333425288_Current_Trends_in_On-line_Games_for_Teaching_Programming_Concepts_to_Primary_School_Students","abstract":"In this paper current trends in online educational games for teaching programming concepts, or else computational thinking, to primary school students are analyzed. Specifically, several online games such as CodeMonkey, Getcoding, Kodable, Lightbot, Program Your Robot, Rapid Router and Run Marco are briefly presented. This is followed by a comparative analysis of important features both regarding the game mechanics and their educational aspects. Specifically, the following features are analyzed: the genre and the scenario of the game, game mechanics used for entertainment purposes, programming concepts/constructs supported, the support provided by the editor for implementing programs, testing and debugging facilities. Moreover, enhanced features, such as the support for creating on-line classrooms, monitoring studentsâ€™ progress and capabilities of creating new levels in the game are investigated. Conclusions and open-issues for further research in the field are presented.","authors":["Andreas Giannakoulas","Stelios Xinogalos"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-20954-4_5","In book: Technology and Innovation in Learning, Teaching and Education (pp.62-78)"],"references":["323657622_A_pilot_study_on_the_effectiveness_and_acceptance_of_an_educational_game_for_teaching_programming_concepts_to_primary_school_students","311474810_Influence_of_the_familiarization_with_scratch_on_future_teachers'_opinions_and_attitudes_about_programming_and_ICT_in_education","305186960_Developing_an_Educational_Game_to_support_Cognitive_Learning","305084679_Learning_Programming_through_Games_and_Contests_Overview_Characterisation_and_Discussion","281847214_Microworlds_games_animations_mobile_apps_puzzle_editors_and_more_What_is_important_for_an_introductory_programming_environment","274378317_A_Serious_Game_for_Developing_Computational_Thinking_and_Learning_Introductory_Computer_Programming","267034149_Educational_Games_for_Teaching_Computer_Programming","267034137_Designing_educational_games_for_computer_programming_A_holistic_framework","266078131_Integrating_Learning_Analytics_in_an_Educational_MMORPG_for_Computer_Programming","264555727_Introducing_basic_Programming_Concepts_to_Elementary_School_Children","257719457_Learning_Programming_at_the_Computational_Thinking_Level_via_Digital_Game-Play","255964908_Using_Flowchart-based_Programming_Environments_for_Simplifying_Programming_and_Software_Engineering_Processes","228964387_Game2learn_A_study_of_games_as_tools_for_learning_introductory_programming_concepts","223617670_An_introduction_to_object-oriented_programming_with_a_didactic_microworld_objectKarel","220808400_Influence_of_the_familiarization_with_scratch_on_future_teachers'_opinions_and_attitudes_about_programming_and_ICT_in_education","220807205_Game2Learn_building_CS1_learning_games_for_retention","49588459_The_Character_of_Successful_Trainings_with_Serious_Games","27380823_Introducing_Novices_to_Programming_a_review_of_Teaching_Approaches_and_Educational_Tools","309471228_Informing_Content-driven_Design_of_Computer_Programming_Games_a_Problems_Analysis_and_a_Game_Review","301639249_CMX_The_Effects_of_an_Educational_MMORPG_on_Learning_and_Teaching_Computer_Programming","267331486_A_Review_of_Games_Designed_to_Improve_Introductory_Computer_Programming_Competencies","238591773_Innovate_in_your_program_computer_class_An_approach_based_on_a_serious_game"]}
