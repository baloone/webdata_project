{"id":"284281796_On_randomization_of_neural_networks_as_a_form_of_post-learning_strategy","abstract":"Today artificial neural networks are applied in various fields - engineering,\ndata analysis, robotics. While they represent a successful tool for a variety\nof relevant applications, mathematically speaking they are still far from being\nconclusive. In particular, they suffer from being unable to find the best\nconfiguration possible during the training process (local minimum problem). In\nthis paper, we focus on this issue and suggest a simple, but effective,\npost-learning strategy to allow the search for improved set of weights at a\nrelatively small extra computational cost. Therefore, we introduce a novel\ntechnique based on analogy with quantum effects occurring in nature as a way to\nimprove (and sometimes overcome) this problem. Several numerical experiments\nare presented to validate the approach.","authors":["Kristina Kapanova","Ivan Dimov","J. M.
