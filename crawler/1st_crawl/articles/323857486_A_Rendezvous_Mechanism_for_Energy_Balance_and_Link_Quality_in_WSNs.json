{"id":"323857486_A_Rendezvous_Mechanism_for_Energy_Balance_and_Link_Quality_in_WSNs","abstract":"Quorum System is a good method to assist the design of sensors of the wake-up scheduling mechanism. However, there are some problems about idle rendezvous and poor link quality when the sensor performs a sensing task according to the Quorum System. In order to improve the efficiency of the sensors and reduce energy consumption, a new rendezvous mechanism is proposed. The use of energy and the link quality between sensors are considered from a global perspective. It can not only ensure the rendezvous opportunity among sensors, but also balance the residual energy of the sensors, so it can improve the energy-saving efficiency of traditional Quorum System. According to the simulation, compared with the traditional Quorum System scheduling mechanism, the rendezvous mechanism proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the number of time-slots when the sensor is idle. Moreover, it also realizes the balance of the residual energy of the sensor and the link quality, which prolongs the life cycle of the wireless sensor network and improves the communication quality.","authors":["Yujun Zhu","Jie Mei","Dadong Zhao","Qun Fang"],"meta":["April 2018Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences 23(2):103-110","DOI:10.1007/s11859-018-1300-7"],"references":["303286937_EnergyEfficient_Probabilistic_Area_Coverage_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","282243693_Handling_Neighbor_Discovery_and_Rendezvous_Consistency_with_Weighted_Quorum-Based_Approach","226172623_Cross-Layer_Energy-Efficient_Design_for_Supporting_Continuous_Queries_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Quorum-Based_Approach","220331091_Heterogenous_Quorum-Based_Wake-Up_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3199342_A_Centralized_Energy-Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","309081922_Delay-Aware_Energy_Optimization_for_Flooding_in_Duty-Cycled_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","309060899_Neighbor_Discovery_and_Rendezvous_Maintenance_with_Extended_Quorum_Systems_for_Mobile_Applications","303358847_On_the_importance_of_link_characterization_for_aerial_wireless_sensor_networks","290509479_Low-Energy_Adaptive_Clustering_Hierarchy_Using_Affinity_Propagation_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","276088036_Intelligent_Coordinator_Selection_Mechanism_ICSM_for_IEEE802154_Beacon-Enabled_MAC_Protocol_in_Mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","272350384_Energy_Replenishment_using_Renewable_and_Traditional_Energy_Resources_for_Sustainable_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Review","261465131_EQS_Neighbor_Discovery_and_Rendezvous_Maintenance_with_Extended_Quorum_System_for_Mobile_Sensing_Applications","257582272_Queen-MAC_A_quorum-based_energy-efficient_medium_access_control_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","224608419_A_Quorum-Based_Energy-Saving_MAC_Protocol_Design_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3433278_On_energy_provisioning_and_relay_node_placement_for_wireless_sensor_networks","3161683_Energy-Efficient_Scheduling_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
