The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F 1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F 1 score.","authors":["Davide Chicco","Niklas TÃ¶tsch","Giuseppe Jurman"],"meta":["February 2021BioData Mining 14(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13040-021-00244-z"],"references":["339667418_Accuracy_of_MRI_Classification_Algorithms_in_a_Tertiary_Memory_Center_Clinical_Routine_Cohort","338351315_The_advantages_of_the_Matthews_correlation_coefficient_MCC_over_F1_score_and_accuracy_in_binary_classification_evaluation","334852390_Multi-Level_Comparison_of_Machine_Learning_Classifiers_and_Their_Performance_Metrics","331744979_Estimating_classification_accuracy_in_positive-unlabeled_learning_characterization_and_correction_strategies","350680685_Classifier_uncertainty_evidence_potential_impact_and_probabilistic_treatment","344723473_Model_Selection_and_Error_Estimation_in_a_Nutshell","342421101_H-Accuracy_an_Alternative_Metric_to_Assess_Classification_Models_in_Medicine","333165304_DETAILED_SEDIMENT_CLASS_MAPPING_USING_UNMANNED_AERIAL_VEHICLES","331402961_The_impact_of_class_imbalance_in_classification_performance_metrics_based_on_the_binary_confusion_matrix","330831604_PMT_New_analytical_framework_for_automated_evaluation_of_geo-environmental_modelling_approaches"]}
