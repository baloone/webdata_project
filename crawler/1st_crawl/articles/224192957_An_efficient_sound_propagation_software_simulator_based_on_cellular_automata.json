{"id":"224192957_An_efficient_sound_propagation_software_simulator_based_on_cellular_automata","abstract":"A software simulator based on cellular nonlinear networks used to model the sound wave propagation equation is proposed and its performances are evaluated. For applications in robotics the simulator is conceived as a kernel upon which one may build up additional software modules to generate various navigation scenarios. Consequently our simulator allows to do various virtual experiments, useful for the design of various parts from a bio-inspired sensor system Such experiments include the study of sensor geometry, the influence of the transmitting ultrasonic signal sensor and many others.","authors":["Radu Dogaru","Ioana Dogaru"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1109/ISEEE.2010.5628499","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ISEEE), 2010 3rd International Symposium on"],"references":["242162544_The_Lattice_Boltzmann_Method_with_Applications_in_Acoustics","228953798_Simulating_the_mechanism_of_sound_generation_in_flutes_using_the_lattice_Boltzmann_method","224722608_Navigating_vehicles_through_an_unstructured_environment_with_sonar","224155661_HCA101_A_chaotic_map_based_on_cellular_automata_with_binary_synchronization_properties","222258838_Application_of_lattice_Boltzmann_method_finite_element_method_and_cellular_automata_and_their_coupling_to_wave_propagation_problems","277291461_Towards_a_Bionic_Bat_A_biomimetic_investigation_of_active_sensing_Doppler-shift_estimation_and_ear_morphology_design_for_mobile_robots","243761766_The_map-building_and_exploration_strategies_of_simple_sonar-equipped_mobile_robot","220696023_Systematic_Design_for_Emergence_in_Cellular_Nonlinear_Networks_With_Applications_in_Natural_Computing_and_Signal_Processing","36435328_Study_on_Acoustic_Field_with_Fractal_Boundary_Using_Cellular_Automata","3432412_Cellular_wave_computers_for_brain-like_spatial-temporal_sensory_computing","3298347_A_High-Resolution_Sensor_Based_on_Tri-aural_Perception"]}
