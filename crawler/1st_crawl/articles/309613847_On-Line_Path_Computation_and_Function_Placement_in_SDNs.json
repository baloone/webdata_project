{"id":"309613847_On-Line_Path_Computation_and_Function_Placement_in_SDNs","abstract":"We consider service requests that arrive in an online fashion in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) with network function virtualization (NFV). Each request is a flow with a high-level specification of routing and processing (by network functions) requirements. Each network function can be performed by a specified subset of servers in the system. The algorithm needs to decide whether to reject the request, or accept it and with a specific routing and processing assignment, under given capacity constraints (solving the path computation and function placement problems). Each served request is assumed to “pay” a pre-specified benefit and the goal is to maximize the total benefit accrued.\nIn this paper we first formalize the problem, and propose a new service model that allows us to cope with requests with unknown duration without preemption. The new service model augments the traditional accept/reject schemes with a new possible response of “stand by.” We also present a new expressive model to describe requests abstractly using a “plan” represented by a directed graph. Our algorithmic result is an online algorithm for path computation and function placement that guarantees, in each time step, throughput of at least a logarithmic fraction of a (very permissive) upper bound on the maximal possible benefit.","authors":["Guy Even","Moti Medina","Boaz Patt-Shamir"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49259-9_11","Conference: International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems"],"references":["301855728_An_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Path_Computation_and_Function_Placement_in_SDNs","263699248_Merlin_A_Language_for_Provisioning_Network_Resources","262805723_Software-Defined_Networking_A_Comprehensive_Survey","234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","221663239_Online_Multi-Commodity_Flow_with_High_Demands","3593584_Throughput-competitive_on-line_routing","310506879_An_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Path_Computation_and_Function_Placement_in_SDNs","310402990_Near_optimal_placement_of_virtual_network_functions","308855122_Near_optimal_placement_of_virtual_network_functions","262360476_Managing_the_network_with_Merlin","262154555_Competitive_Routing_of_Virtual_Circuits_with_Unknown_Duration","247931082_Introduction_to_automata_theory_languages_and_computation_-_2_ed","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","224678301_Improved_Bounds_for_Online_Routing_and_Packing_Via_a_Primal-Dual_Approach","220442740_Online_Primal-Dual_Algorithms_for_Covering_and_Packing","48196315_Competitive_and_Deterministic_Embeddings_of_Virtual_Networks","35040715_Approximation_algorithms_for_disjoint_paths_problems","2647292_On-Line_Routing_of_Virtual_Circuits_with_Applications_to_Load_Balancing_and_Machine_Scheduling","2423142_Competitive_Routing_of_Virtual_Circuits_with_Unknown_Duration"]}
