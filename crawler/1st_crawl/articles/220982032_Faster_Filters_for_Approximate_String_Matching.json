{"id":"220982032_Faster_Filters_for_Approximate_String_Matching","abstract":"We introduce a new filtering method for approximate string matching called the suffix filter. It has some similarity with well-known filtration algorithms, which we call factor filters, and which are among the best practical algorithms for approximate string matching using a text index. Suffix filters are stronger, i.e., produce fewer false matches than factor filters. We demonstrate experimentally that suffix filters are faster in practice, too.","authors":["Juha Kärkkäinen","Joong Chae Na"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611972870.8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments, ALENEX 2007, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, January 6, 2007"],"references":["229067733_Linear_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm","221591874_Dictionary_matching_and_indexing_with_errors_and_don't_cares","221580242_Dotted_Suffix_Trees_A_Structure_for_Approximate_Text_Indexing","220224077_Faster_Approximate_String_Matching","11430533_PATTERNHUNTER_faster_and_more_sensitive_homology_search","2548854_Indexing_Methods_for_Approximate_String_Matching","228778716_A_hybrid_indexing_method_for_approximate_string_matching","226082222_Text_Indexing_with_Errors","221313694_Fast_Approximate_Matching_using_Suffix_Trees","220657860_A_linear_size_index_for_approximate_pattern_matching","220423613_Fast_Text_Searching_Allowing_Errors","47843067_Better_Filtering_with_Gapped_q-Grams","2375410_A_Guided_Tour_to_Approximate_String_Matching"]}
