{"id":"314194101_Resilient_control_under_Denial-of-Service_Robust_design","abstract":"In this paper, we study networked control systems in the presence of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, namely attacks that prevent transmissions over the communication network. The control objective is to maximize frequency and duration of the DoS attacks under which closed-loop stability is not destroyed. A family of impulsive controllers is proposed, which achieve the considered control objective for a general class of DoS signals. An example is given to illustrate the proposed solution approach.","authors":["Shuai Feng","Pietro Tesi"],"meta":["May 2017Automatica 79:42-51","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.01.031"],"references":["261440144_On_Resilient_Control_of_Nonlinear_Systems_under_Denial-of-Service","252039205_Digital_Filter_Design_for_Jamming_Mitigation_in_802154_Communication","224220545_Optimal_Control_in_the_Presence_of_an_Intelligent_Jammer_with_Limited_Actions","224142130_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_in_Wireless_Networks_The_Case_of_Jammers","221422380_Safe_and_Secure_Networked_Control_Systems_under_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","220465991_Mitigation_of_Control_Channel_Jamming_under_Node_Capture_Attacks","308766476_Networked_control_of_nonlinear_systems_under_Denial-of-Service","305906813_Resilient_control_under_Denial-of-Service_Robust_design","304411217_Output-based_event-triggered_control_systems_under_Denial-of-Service_attacks","304410838_Self-triggered_coordination_over_a_shared_network_under_Denial-of-Service","304410660_Event-triggered_control_over_unreliable_networks_subject_to_jamming_attacks","277607377_Input-to-State_Stabilizing_Control_Under_Denial-of-Service","261065625_Control_over_adversarial_packet-dropping_communication_networks_revisited","261051855_On_event-triggered_control_of_linear_systems_under_periodic_denial-of-service_jamming_attacks","256660898_Periodic_event-triggered_control_for_linear_systems","233815581_A_Secure_Control_Framework_for_Resource-Limited_Adversaries","221044143_Lazy_sensors_for_the_scheduling_of_measurement_samples_transmission_in_linear_closed_loops_over_networks","3206701_Scheduling_of_Networked_Control_Systems"]}
