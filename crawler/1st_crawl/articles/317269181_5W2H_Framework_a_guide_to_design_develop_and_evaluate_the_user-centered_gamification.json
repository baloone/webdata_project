{"id":"317269181_5W2H_Framework_a_guide_to_design_develop_and_evaluate_the_user-centered_gamification","abstract":"Gamification, which is the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has been widely applied in order to persuade and engage their users with a specific purpose. Since each user has different characteristics, his/her experience during the interaction with these game elements becomes singular and gamification may not always have the expected outcome. This paper presents a framework to assist in the design, development and evaluation of user-centered gamification. Based on major works and concepts in the field, seven main aspects that influence the gamification were raised and, from them, the framework is presented and its application in educational system is being currently performed.","authors":["Ana Carolina Tom√© Klock","Isabela Gasparini","Marcelo Pimenta"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/3033701.3033715","Conference: the 15th Brazilian Symposium"],"references":["326162827_Does_gamification_matter_a_systematic_mapping_about_the_evaluation_of_gamification_in_educational_environments","322828082_Enhancing_student_learning_experience_with_technology-mediated_gamification_An_empirical_study","319472482_Elements_of_Gameful_Design_Emerging_from_User_Preferences","317232419_Gamification_a_systematic_review_of_design_frameworks","283846862_Validating_Gamification_Mechanics_and_Player_Types_in_an_E-learning_Environment","283684293_One_man's_trash_is_another_man's_treasure_um_mapeamento_sistematico_sobre_as_caracteristicas_individuais_na_gamificacao_de_ambientes_virtuais_de_aprendizagem","282683943_Gamified_Culture-Aware_Feedback_Acquisition","279059823_A_Literature_Review_of_Gamification_Design_Frameworks","279059685_A_literature_review_of_gamification_design_frameworks","273852059_A_Mobile_Game-based_Insect_Learning_System_for_Improving_the_Learning_Achievements","271643441_Does_Gamification_Work_for_Boys_and_Girls_An_Exploratory_Study_with_a_Virtual_Learning_Environment","270273830_Gamification_in_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","269293010_The_design_of_adaptive_acquisition_of_users_feedback_An_empirical_study","268233579_Gamification_and_service_marketing","266398023_Gamification_in_Theory_and_Action_A_Survey","266327414_Motivational_effects_and_age_differences_of_gamification_in_product_advertising","265141854_Ambientes_Virtuais_de_Aprendizagem","262167616_Gamification_work","260432497_Demographic_differences_in_perceived_benefits_from_gamification","260284527_How_to_develop_financial_applications_with_game_features_in_e-banking","256194365_Gamifying_Learning_Experiences_Practical_Implications_and_Outcomes","255708104_Process_of_Gamification_From_The_Consideration_of_Gamification_To_Its_Practical_Implementation","235788722_The_Gamification_experience_UXD_with_gamification_background","233864602_User_experience_-_A_research_agenda","227619111_Self-Determination_Theory_and_Work_Motivation","222421382_Me_myself_and_I_The_role_of_interactional_context_on_self-presentation_through_avatars","221518895_Gamification_Using_game_design_elements_in_non-gaming_contexts","221515030_Evaluating_user_experiences_in_games","346488445_Designing_Gamified_Systems","329181478_A_gamification-based_framework_for_developing_learning_activities_of_computational_thinking","321617541_Evaluating_User_Experience_in_Games_Concepts_and_Methods","319296152_Does_gender_stereotype_threat_in_gamified_educational_environments_cause_anxiety_An_experimental_study","311093965_Individualising_gamification_An_investigation_of_the_impact_of_learning_styles_and_personality_traits_on_the_efficacy_of_gamification_using_a_prediction_market","300644427_Gamification_in_e-Learning_Systems_A_Conceptual_Model_to_Engage_Students_and_Its_Application_in_an_Adaptive_e-Learning_System","289963904_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivations_Classic_definitions_and_new_directions","286824358_An_Investigation_of_Gamification_Typologies_for_Enhancing_Learner_Motivation","282682554_Adaptive_Approach_for_Gamification_Optimization","279355975_Experimentation_in_Software_Engineering","274814512_Schedules_of_Reinforcement","273946893_For_the_Win_How_Game_Thinking_can_Revolutionize_your_Business","270823073_Gamification_in_assessment_Do_points_affect_test_performance","266656471_The_missing_piece_in_the_gamification_puzzle","262841944_Leaderboards_in_a_virtual_classroom_A_test_of_stereotype_threat_and_social_comparison_explanations_for_women's_math_performance","256867741_Persuasive_Technology","249797781_School_Engagement_Potential_of_the_Concept_State_of_the_Evidence","247723654_Burnout_and_Engagement_in_University_StudentsA_Cross-National_Study","230877240_Persuasive_Technology_Using_Computers_to_Change_What_We_Think_and_Do","230854806_A_social_gamification_framework_for_a_K-6_learning_platform","230854793_The_Gamification_of_Learning_and_Instruction_Game-based_Methods_and_Strategies_for_Training_and_Eduction","225269894_Coefficient_Alpha_and_Internal_Structure_of_Tests","26514491_Design_aesthetics_Principles_of_pleasure_in_design","220694443_Gamification_by_Design_Implementing_Game_Mechanics_in_Web_and_Mobile_Apps","220422686_Design_for_Usability_Key_Principles_and_What_Designers_Think"]}
