{"id":"220858755_Effective_Algorithm_for_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Complex_Networks_Based_on_GA_and_Clustering","abstract":"The study of networked systems has experienced a particular surge of interest in the last decade. One issue that has received\na considerable amount of attention is the detection and characterization of community structure in networks, meaning the appearance\nof densely connected groups of vertices, with only sparser connections between groups. In this paper, we present an approach\nfor the problem of community detection using genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with the method of clustering. We demonstrate\nthat our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network\ndata, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes daunting complex real-world systems of scale-free network\nstructure.","authors":["Xin Liu","Deyi Li","Shuliang Wang","Zhiwei Tao"],"meta":["May 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-72586-2_95","SourceDBLP","Conference: Computational Science - ICCS 2007, 7th International Conference, Beijing, China, May 27 - 30, 2007, Proceedings, Part II","Project: H.-P.
