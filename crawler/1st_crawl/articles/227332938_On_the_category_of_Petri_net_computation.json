{"id":"227332938_On_the_category_of_Petri_net_computation","abstract":"We introduce the notion of strongly concatenable process as a refinement of concatenable processes [3] which can be expressed axiomatically via a functor \nQ{\\cal Q}\n[_] from the category of Petri nets to an appropriate category of symmetric strict monoidal categories, in the precise sense that, for each net N, the strongly concatenable processes of N are isomorphic to the arrows of \nQ{\\cal Q}\n[N]. In addition, we identify a coreflection right adjoint to \nQ{\\cal Q}\n[_] and characterize its replete image, thus yielding an axiomatization of the category of net computations.","authors":["V.
