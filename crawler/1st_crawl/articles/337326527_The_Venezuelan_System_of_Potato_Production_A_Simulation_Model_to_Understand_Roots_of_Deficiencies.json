{"id":"337326527_The_Venezuelan_System_of_Potato_Production_A_Simulation_Model_to_Understand_Roots_of_Deficiencies","abstract":"The Venezuelan system of potato and potato seed production endures many deficiencies, while potatoes used to be an essential component of inhabitants’ food. To discover the deep roots of these deficiencies, we propose a simulation model of this system, and then combine structural properties of the model with simulation results in order to consolidate the validity of the model, elucidate some of its key features, and suggest a way to improve its fairness. The model is designed using the SocLab framework, a formalization of Systems of Organized Action, that considers how regulations emerge from balancing processes of power relationships between social actors.","authors":["Oswaldo Terán","Christophe Sibertin-Blanc","Ravi Rojas","Liccia Romero"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-30298-6_8","In book: Social Simulation for a Digital Society (pp.91-108)"],"references":["284557371_SocLab_A_Framework_for_the_Modeling_Simulation_and_Analysis_of_Power_in_Social_Organizations","282351041_The_influence_of_moral_sensitivity_on_organizational_cooperation","280700621_The_Efficiency_of_Organizational_Withdrawal_vs_Commitment","262176379_Boundedly_Rational_Agents_Playing_the_Social_Actors_Game_How_to_Reach_Cooperation","286054698_Procesos_de_transformacion_territorial_y_agendas_de_desarrollo_rural_El_municipio_rangel_y_la_asociacion_de_productores_integrales_del_paramo_proinpa_en_los_andes_venezolanos","284740893_Simulating_Social_Phenomena","44733664_La_estrategia_de_la_semilla_en_el_sistema_papero_de_Los_Andes_de_Merida_una_vision_desde_la_perspectiva_agroecologica_Liccia_Romero","23740441_Advancing_the_Art_of_Simulation_in_the_Social_Sciences"]}
