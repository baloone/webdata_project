{"id":"287251277_ClusPath_A_Temporal-driven_Clustering_to_Infer_Typical_Evolution_Paths","abstract":"We propose ClusPath, a novel algorithm for detecting general evolution\ntendencies in a population of entities. We show how abstract notions, such as\nthe Swedish socio-economical model (in a political dataset) or the companies\nfiscal optimization (in an economical dataset) can be inferred from low-level\ndescriptive features. Such high-level regularities in the evolution of entities\nare detected by combining spatial and temporal features into a spatio-temporal\ndissimilarity measure and using semi-supervised clustering techniques. The\nrelations between the evolution phases are modeled using a graph structure,\ninferred simultaneously with the partition, by using a \"slow changing world\"\nassumption. The idea is to ensure a smooth passage for entities along their\nevolution paths, which catches the long-term trends in the dataset.\nAdditionally, we also provide a method, based on an evolutionary algorithm, to\ntune the parameters of ClusPath to new, unseen datasets. This method assesses\nthe fitness of a solution using four opposed quality measures and proposes a\nbalanced compromise.","authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Julien Velcin","Stephane Bonnevay","St√©phane Lallich"],"meta":["September 2016Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 30(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10618-015-0445-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["275635497_How_to_Use_Temporal-Driven_Constrained_Clustering_to_Detect_Typical_Evolutions","262407208_Where_Are_We_Going_Predicting_the_Evolution_of_Individuals","260197818_Optimization_of_a_complex_urban_intersection_using_discrete_event_simulation_and_evolutionary_algorithms","313080902_Multicriteria_relational_clustering_the_case_of_binary_outranking_matrices_Evolutionary_multi-criterion_optimization","285916832_Theory_of_Multiobjective_Optimization","282320523_Semi-supervised_Kernel-Based_Temporal_Clustering","271463827_Quantitative_Prediction_of_Glaucomatous_Visual_Field_Loss_from_Few_Measurements","263388156_Multicriteria_Classification_with_Unknown_Categories_A_Clustering-Sorting_Approach_and_an_Application_to_Conflict_Management","254463639_Generative_Models_for_Evolutionary_Clustering","247662284_Structuring_Continuous_Video_Recordings_of_Everyday_Life_Using_Time-Constrained_Clustering","234000659_Structuring_Typical_Evolutions_Using_Temporal-Driven_Constrained_Clustering","225140109_On_Discovering_Moving_Clusters_in_Spatio-temporal_Data","239395201_A_fuzzy_relative_of_the_ISODATA_Process_and_Its_Use_in_Detecting_Compact_Well-Separated_Clusters","224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","224718718_Multimodal_Diaries"]}
