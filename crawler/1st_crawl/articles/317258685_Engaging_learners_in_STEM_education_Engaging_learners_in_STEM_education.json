We focus on the following\nquestion: “How can we support students in building a deep, integrated knowledge\nof STEM so that they have the practical knowledge and problem solving skills\nnecessary to live in and improve the world?” We also discuss criteria for evaluating\nSTEM learning environments and the challenges teachers face in implementing\nSTEM. We define STEM as the integration of science, engineering, technology,\nand mathematics to focus on solving pressing individual and societal problems.\nEngaging students in STEM also means engaging learners in the design process.\nDesign is integral to student thinking in the STEM world. The design process\nis very non-linear and iterative in its nature but requires clearly articulating and\nidentifying the design problem, researching what is known about the problem,\ngenerating potential solutions, developing prototype designs (artifacts) that\ndemonstrate solutions, and sharing and receiving feedback. With the integration\nof design, STEM education has the potential to support students in learning big\nideas in science and engineering, as well as important scientific and engineering\npractices, and support students in developing important motivational outcomes\nsuch as ownership, agency and efficacy. Moreover, students who engage in STEM\nlearning environments will also develop 21st century capabilities such as problem\nsolving, communication, and collaboration skills.","authors":["Joseph Krajcik","Ibrahim Delen"],"meta":["April 2017Eesti Haridusteaduste Ajakiri = Estonian Journal of Education 5(1):10-58","DOI:10.12697/eha.2017.5.1.02b"],"references":["305073376_How_to_Support_Learners_in_Developing_Usable_and_Lasting_Knowledge_of_STEM","283889943_Using_Mobile_Devices_to_Connect_Teachers_and_Museum_Educators","252404504_Science_Education_in_Europe_Critical_Reflections","326562023_Teaching_Science_in_Elementary_and_Middle_School_A_Project-Based_Learning_Approach","321918340_Helping_Students_make_Sense_of_the_World_through_Next_Generation_Science_and_Engineering_Practices","321300499_The_Cambridge_handbook_of_the_learning_sciences_second_edition","313281631_Integrating_Technology_Students_Making_Systems_Models_An_Accessible_Approach","295396969_Project-based_learning","260144575_Digital_Resources_versus_cognitive_tools_A_discussion_of_learning_science_with_technology","259128843_Adolescents'_declining_motivation_to_learn_science_A_follow-up_study","228696516_Engineering_Competitions_in_the_Middle_School_Classroom_Key_Elements_in_Developing_Effective_Design_Challenges","237521959_The_Big_Ideas_in_Nanoscale_Science_and_Engineering","234675544_Learning_Progressions_in_Science_An_Evidence-Based_Approach_to_Reform_CPRE_Research_Report_RR-63","228767247_How_Well_Do_Middle_School_Science_Programs_Measure_Up_Findings_from_Project_2061's_Curriculum_Review","227658611_A_Method_for_Analyzing_the_Coherence_of_High_School_Biology_Textbooks"]}
