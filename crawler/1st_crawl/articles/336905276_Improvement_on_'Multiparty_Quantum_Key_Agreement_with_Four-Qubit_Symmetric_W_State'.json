{"id":"336905276_Improvement_on_'Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_with_Four-Qubit_Symmetric_W_State'","abstract":"Recently, Wang et al. (Int J Theo Phys: pp. 3716â€“3726, 2018) proposed a multiparty quantum key agreement scheme with four-particles W state. Their protocol uses the delayed measurement technique, the block transmission technique, and the single decoy photon technique to determine a shared secret key between three or more participants. They claimed that their protocol could resist both internal/participant and external attacks. However, this work indicates that two dishonest participants can collude to get the private data of a participant who executes the protocol honestly. To solve this issue, a simple modification is suggested in this work.","authors":["Hussein Abulkasim","Afraa Alotaibi"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of Theoretical Physics 58(12)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-019-04293-3"],"references":["333154214_Efficient_semi-quantum_private_comparison_using_single_photons","333024977_Quantum_key_agreement_with_Bell_states_and_Cluster_states_under_collective_noise_channels","332847922_Circular_Controlled_Quantum_Teleportation_by_a_Genuine_Seven-qubit_Entangled_State","332810131_Improvement_on_'Cryptanalysis_and_Improvement_of_a_Multiparty_Quantum_Direct_Secret_Sharing_of_Classical_Messages_with_Bell_States_and_Bell_Measurements'","332592223_Improving_the_Security_of_'High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom'","332280768_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Efficient_Controlled_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_and_Authentication_by_Using_Four_Particle_Cluster_States_Protocol","331719083_Multi-Party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_with_Bell_States_and_Single_Particles","330527189_Improved_Dynamic_Multi-Party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_for_Next_Generation_Mobile_Network","329074531_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_with_Entanglement_Swapping","334839734_Privacy-preserving_quantum_multi-party_computation_based_on_circular_structure","328209702_Improving_the_security_of_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_with_single_photon_in_both_polarization_and_spatial-mode_degrees_of_freedom","327560095_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_with_Four-Qubit_Symmetric_W_State","326664068_An_Improved_Quantum_Voting_Scheme","326193828_Fault-tolerant_asymmetric_quantum_dialogue_protocols_against_collective_noise","326034318_A_New_Cryptography_Algorithm_for_Quantum_Images"]}
