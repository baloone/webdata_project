{"id":"356644636_New_Results_for_Arithmetic_-Geometric_Mean_Inequalities_and_Singular_Values_in_Matrices","abstract":"Matrix theory is very popular in different kind of sciences such as engineering, architecture, physics, chemistry, computer science, IT, so on as well as mathematics many theoretical results dealing with the structure of the matrices even this topic seems easy to work. That is why many scientists still consider some open problem in matrix theory. In this paper, generalizations of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality is presented for singular values related to block matrices. Singular values are also given for sums, products and direct sums of the matrices.","authors":["Ahmad Abu Rahma","Aliaa Burqan","Özen Özer"],"meta":["November 2021WSEAS Transactions on Mathematics 20:625-629","DOI:10.37394/23206.2021.20.66"],"references":["316926182_Singular_Value_and_Norm_Inequalities_Associated_with_2_x_2_Positive_Semidefinite_Block_Matrices","256805757_More_Results_on_Singular_Value_Inequalities_for_Compact_Operators","348847051_Monaural_Singing_Voice_Separation_Using_Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Weighted_Values","290455119_Recent_developments_of_matrix_versions_of_the_arithmetic-geometric_mean_inequality","247047254_On_the_Singular_Values_of_a_Product_of_Operators","243095344_Singular_Values_of_Differences_of_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices","238850709_More_results_on_singular_value_inequalities_of_matrices","222220843_Inequalities_for_sums_and_products_of_operators","222033826_The_matrix_arithmetic-geometric_mean_inequality_revisited","200524170_Matrix_Analysis"]}
