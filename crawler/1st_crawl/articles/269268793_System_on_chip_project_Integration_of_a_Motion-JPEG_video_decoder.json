{"id":"269268793_System_on_chip_project_Integration_of_a_Motion-JPEG_video_decoder","abstract":"The goal of this activity is to discover different steps of a Multi Processor-SoC hardware and software design process through the integration of a Motion-JPEG decoder application on a multiprocessor hardware platform. The first step consists in getting more familiar with the SOCLib cycle-accurate/bit-accurate hardware simulation environment by connecting several devices to a pre-existing hardware platform. Then, students understand the hardware requirements in order to execute a parallelized version of a MJPEG decoder and modify the previous platform accordingly. This is also the first occasion to start working with the operating system. Finally, students go deeper inside the operating systems and use this knowledge to enhance existing drivers and write new ones.","authors":["Lorena Anghel","Mounir Benabdenbi","Frédéric Pétrot"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.1109/EWME.2014.6877419","Conference: 2014 10th European Workshop on Microelectronics Education (EWME)"],"references":["232799009_All-optical_high-speed_signal_processing_with_silicon-organic_hybrid_slot_waveguides","43134393_Ultrashort_free-carrier_lifetime_in_low-loss_silicon_nanowaveguides","4280815_Deep-UV_Lithography_Fabrication_of_Slot_Waveguides_and_Sandwiched_Waveguides_for_Nonlinear_Applications","42805537_Ultrafast_All-Optical_Switching_in_a_Silicon-Nanocrystal-Based_Silicon_Slot_Waveguide_at_Telecom_Wavelengths","24175372_Bound_electronic_and_free_carrier_nonlinearities_in_Silicon_nanocrystals_at_1550nm"]}
