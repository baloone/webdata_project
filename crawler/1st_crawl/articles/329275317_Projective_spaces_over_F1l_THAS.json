{"id":"329275317_Projective_spaces_over_F1l_THAS","abstract":"In this essay, we study various notions of projective space (and other schemes) over (Formula presented.), with (Formula presented.) denoting the field with one element. Our leading motivation is the “Hidden Points Principle,” which shows a huge deviation between the set of rational points as closed points defined over (Formula presented.) and the set of rational points defined as morphisms (Formula presented.). We also introduce, in the same vein as Kurokawa [Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. A Math. Sci. 81 (2005), pp. 180–184], schemes of (Formula presented.) -type and consider their zeta functions.","authors":["Koen Thas"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Combinatorial Designs 27(2)","DOI:10.1002/jcd.21639"],"references":["259402982_Schemes_over_F1_and_Zeta_Functions","282056647_Les_Varietes_sur_le_Corps_a_un_Element","276149412_Deitmar_schemes_graphs_and_zeta_functions","265427522_F1-schemes_and_toric_varieties","265373095_Lecture_on_zeta_functions_and_motives_according_to_Deninger_and_Kurokawa","226336843_On_the_G-factors_attached_to_motives","226044419_LocalL-factors_of_motives_and_regularized_determinants","224039659_Blueprints_-_towards_absolute_arithmetic","221672877_Projective_geometry_for_blueprints","48210475_Congruence_schemes","38339437_Zeta_functions_over_mathbfF_1","2134216_Mixed_Hodge_polynomials_of_character_varieties","2128039_Remarks_on_zeta_functions_and_K-theory_over_F1"]}
