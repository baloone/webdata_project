{"id":"216300933_The_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy_A_New_Baseline_Algorithm_for_Pareto_Multiobjective_Optimisation","abstract":"Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective\noptimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals\nare selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler\nevolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto archived\nevolution strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest\npossible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions\nin the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1+1)\nevolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but\nusing a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to\nidentify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate\nsolution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against\nwhich more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in\nsome real-world applications when local search seems superior to or\ncompetitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new\nalgorithm is compared with that of a MOEA based on the niched Pareto GA\non a real world application from the telecommunications field. In\naddition, we include results from experiments carried out on a suite of\nfour test functions, to demonstrate the algorithm's general capability","authors":["Joshua Damian Knowles","David Corne"],"meta":["January 1999","DOI:10.1109/CEC.1999.781913","Conference: Proc.
