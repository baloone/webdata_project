{"id":"335570727_Intelligent_Analysis_and_Data_Visualisation_for_Teacher_Assistance_tools_the_case_of_exploratory_learning","abstract":"While it is commonly accepted that Learning Analytics tools can support teachersâ€™ awareness and classroom orchestration, not all forms of pedagogy are congruent to the types of data generated by digital technologies or the algorithms used to analyse them. One such pedagogy that has been so far underserved by Learning Analytics is exploratory learning, exemplified by tools such as simulators, virtual labs, microworlds and some interactive educational games. This paper argues that the combination of intelligent analysis of interaction data from such an exploratory learning environment (ELE) and the targeted design of visualisations has the benefit of supporting classroom orchestration and consequently enabling the adoption of this pedagogy to the classroom. We present a case study of learning analytics in the context of an ELE supporting the learning of algebra. We focus on the formative qualitative evaluation of a suite of Teacher Assistance tools. We draw conclusions relating to the value of the tools to teachers and reflect with transferable lessons for future related work.","authors":["Manolis Mavrikis","Eirini Geraniou","Alexandra
