{"id":"236635216_Somoclu_An_Efficient_Parallel_Library_for_Self-Organizing_Maps","abstract":"Somoclu is a massively parallel tool for training self-organizing maps on large data sets written in C++. It builds on OpenMP for multicore execution, and on MPI for distributing the workload across the nodes in a cluster. It is also able to boost training by using CUDA if graphics processing units are available. A sparse kernel is included, which is useful for high-dimensional but sparse data, such as the vector spaces common in text mining workflows. Python, R and MATLAB interfaces facilitate interactive use. Apart from fast execution, memory use is highly optimized, enabling training large emergent maps even on a single computer.","authors":["Peter Wittek","Shi Chao Gao","Ik Soo Lim","Li Zhao"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Statistical Software 78(9):1-21","DOI:10.18637/jss.v078.i09","SourcearXiv"],"references":["288428631_Scalable_Strategies_for_Computing_with_Massive_Data","279706059_Self-_and_Super-organizing_Maps_in_R_The_kohonen_Package","277257897_Distributed_Text_Mining_in_R","259079737_A_GPU-Accelerated_Algorithm_for_Self-Organizing_Maps_in_a_Distributed_Environment","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","287624410_Fastcluster_Fast_Hierarchical_Agglomerative_Clustering_Routines_for_R_and_Python","285599593_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","265919274_Self-organizing_maps_2nd_ed","260955605_Self-Organizing_Maps","258729157_Thrust_Productivity-Oriented_Library_for_CUDA"]}
