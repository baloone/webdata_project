{"id":"318184301_E-government_Contribution_to_Better_Performance_by_Public_Sector","abstract":"E-government is a new phenomenon that improves public services provision to citizens, improves public sector performance, and enriches the political arena. Such ambitious objectives are not fully investigated in the literature, where most research focused on the service provision area. Improving public sector's performance is a vital dimension of e-government benefits and addresses the demands for cutting budgets and the financial situations facing many governments across the world. This study explored the e-government literature to summarize the reported contributions of e-government in relation to improving government performance. The second objective is to conduct an empirical test for our propositions based on public employees' perceptions regarding the set of benefits and contributions alleged by research. A sample of 107 public employees filled a survey summarizing the contributions of e-government based on 6 major dimensions. Conclusions and future work are stated at the end.","authors":["Emad Abu-Shanab"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Electronic Government Research 13(2):81-96","DOI:10.4018/IJEGR.2017040105"],"references":["317108096_Co-design_for_Government_Service_Stakeholders","313123526_A_User-Centric_Evaluation_of_e-Government_Services_in_the_GCC_Region_Case_of_State_of_Qatar","308736879_Investigating_the_Effectiveness_of_E-government_Establishment_in_Government_Organizations","305951383_The_E-government_Information_Model_Based_on_GPR","287217354_Reengineering_the_open_government_concept_An_empirical_support_for_a_proposed_model","285936763_The_relationship_between_transparency_and_egovernment_An_empirical_support","282206014_Study_on_E-Government_services_quality_The_integration_of_online_and_offline_services","281406073_How_e-Government_managers_prioritise_rival_value_positions_The_efficiency_imperative","263339461_Performance_evaluation_of_e-government_services_using_balanced_scorecard_An_empirical_study_in_Jordan","260870254_Government_as_an_Anti-Corruption_Tool_Citizens_Perceptions","260870184_E-Government_and_Social_Media_Sites_The_Role_and_Impact","257103419_E-government_and_citizen's_engagement_with_local_affairs_through_e-websites_The_case_of_Spanish_municipalities","252368077_The_Implementation_Of_ICT_In_Public_Sector_Organisations_Analysing_Selection_Criteria_For_eGovernment_Projects","249234419_Linking_Citizen_Satisfaction_with_E-Government_and_Trust_in_Government","241128006_Security_Challenges_For_Expanding_E-governments'_Services","235307489_Towards_quality_e-service_in_the_public_sector_The_evolution_of_web_sites_in_the_local_public_service_sector","235266791_Barriers_and_benefits_in_the_adoption_of_e-government","235251566_E-government_diffusion_in_Oman_A_public_sector_employees'_perspective","232221329_Benchmarking_EU_e-government_at_the_crossroads_A_framework_for_e-government_benchmark_design_and_improvement","221409468_ICT_Innovation_and_Public_Management_Governance_Models_Alternatives_for_E-Government_Infrastructures","323689849_Gamification_of_e-Government_Services_A_Discussion_of_Potential_Transformation","303321858_Assessing_the_Success_of_E-Government_Systems_An_Employee_Perspective","303266189_Empirical_investigation_on_adoption_of_e-governance_services_in_developing_countries_and_ethical_issues","292716797_Understanding_and_measuring_eGovernment_International_benchmarking_studies","262361059_Improvement_of_e-government_service_process_via_a_grey_relation_agent_mechanism","259920989_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_5","254200209_Towards_a_more_accessible_e-government_in_Jordan_An_evaluation_study_of_visually_impaired_users_and_Web_developers","235310497_E-government_A_new_route_to_public_sector_quality","233012624_Measuring_impacts_of_e-government_support_in_least_developed_countries_A_case_study_of_the_vehicle_registration_service_in_Bhutan","227723255_E-Government_and_the_Transformation_of_Service_Delivery_and_Citizen_Attitudes","227629301_The_Evolution_of_E-Government_Among_Municipalities_Rhetoric_or_Reality","227603058_Reinventing_Local_Governments_and_the_E-Government_Initiative","220393103_Collaborative_E-government_Impediments_and_Benefits_of_Information-sharing_Projects_in_the_Public_Sector","43438937_The_Effects_of_E-Government_on_Trust_and_Confidence_in_Government","42606576_The_Virtual_State_Toward_a_Theory_of_Federal_Bureaucracy_in_the_21st_Century","4779522_The_Real_Benefits_Beneficiaries_and_Value_of_E-Government"]}
