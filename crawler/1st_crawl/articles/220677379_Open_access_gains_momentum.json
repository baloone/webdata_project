{"id":"220677379_Open_access_gains_momentum","abstract":"Journals being offered for open access have been on the increase for over a decade, growing to around 1,200 journals to date. Authors wishing to be published are charged a publication fee, and their papers are made available without any charge to the public. However, journals in the scientific and scholarly field, a total of approximately 25,000, are rarely offered for open access. International pressure from scientists wishing to unblock the barriers that stop the dissemination of research results has caused a rift with publishers, who fear a decrease in publishing revenues.","authors":["Howard Falk"],"meta":["December 2004The Electronic Library 22(6):527-530","DOI:10.1108/02640470410570848","SourceDBLP"],"references":[]}
