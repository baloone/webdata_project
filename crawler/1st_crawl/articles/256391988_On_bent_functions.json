{"id":"256391988_On_bent_functions","abstract":"Let P(x) be a function from GF(2n) to GF(2). P(x) is called “bent” if all Fourier coefficients of (−1)P(x) are ±1. The polynomial degree of a bent function P(x) is studied, as are the properties of the Fourier transform of (−1)P(x), and a connection with Hadamard matrices.","authors":["O.S Rothaus"],"meta":["May 1976Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 20(3):300–305","DOI:10.1016/0097-3165(76)90024-8"],"references":["220076946_A_Family_of_Difference_Sets_in_Non-cyclic_Groups"]}
