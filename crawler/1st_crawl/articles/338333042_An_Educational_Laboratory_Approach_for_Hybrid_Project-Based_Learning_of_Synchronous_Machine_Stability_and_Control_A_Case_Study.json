{"id":"338333042_An_Educational_Laboratory_Approach_for_Hybrid_Project-Based_Learning_of_Synchronous_Machine_Stability_and_Control_A_Case_Study","abstract":"Contribution: A distinct instructional approach to laboratory activities for power system machines, based on hybrid project-based learning (h-PBL). Students develop their own laboratory procedures and explain their results. This approach creates a positive environment to improve students' problem-solving, and their control design and implementation skills. Background: Prior studies on undergraduate education in electric machines show that power systems control techniques are mostly approached as lectures and simulation tasks, which makes it difficult for students to apply these concepts in real situations. Several studies explored the impact of educational platforms on student learning of various power systems subjects, but further investigation is needed to analyze the influence of the instructional approaches used in applying these educational tools. Intended Outcomes: The h-PBL laboratory activities are intended to foster student learning of power system control by replacing the teacher-led approach with a focus on student-centered real-world applications. This method is also expected to improve student skills in control systems design. Application Design: Students have difficulties implementing power system control techniques in real machines since these are abstract and highly complex. The h-PBL laboratory activities allow students to transition from theory to practice by finding their own solutions to the proposed problems. Findings: The h-PBL laboratory had a positive impact on student learning and grades due to factors that include improving student's critical sense and their problem-solving skills, providing more opportunities for peer-to-peer discussion in group h-PBL activities, and increasing students' interest and motivation to learn through practical engineering applications.","authors":["Douglas De Matos Magnus","Luis Felipe Carbonera","Luciano Lopes Pfitscher","F.A.
