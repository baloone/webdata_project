{"id":"332262351_Extension_of_elliptic_curves_on_Krasner_hyperfields","abstract":"The aim of the article is to initiate a new study in the framework of algebraic hyperfields, with an applicative impact in cryptography. First we define the notions of generalized Weierstrass equation and elliptic hypercurve on Krasner hyperfields, as a generalization of the notion of elliptic curve on fields. Then we investigate properties of the hypergroups derived from elliptic hypercurves and of the associated Hv-groups. Finally, we present a class of canonical hypergroups, which can be used as an alphabet in a special cryptographic system.","authors":["Vahid Vahedi","Morteza Jafarpour","H.
