{"id":"305630598_Approximate_Furthest_Neighbor_with_Application_to_Annulus_Query","abstract":"Much recent work has been devoted to approximate nearest neighbor queries. Motivated by applications in recommender systems, we consider approximate furthest neighbor (AFN) queries and present a simple, fast, and highly practical data structure for answering AFN queries in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method builds on the technique of Indyk (SODA 2003), storing random projections to provide sublinear query time for AFN. However, we introduce a different query algorithm, improving on Indyk×³s approximation factor and reducing the running time by a logarithmic factor. We also present a variation based on a query-independent ordering of the database points; while this does not have the provable approximation factor of the query-dependent data structure, it offers significant improvement in time and space complexity. We give a theoretical analysis and experimental results. As an application, the query-dependent approach is used for deriving a data structure for the approximate annulus query problem, which is defined as follows: given an input set S and two parameters and , construct a data structure that returns for each query point q a point such that the distance between p and q is at least and at most .","authors":["Rasmus Pagh","Francesco Silvestri","Johan Sivertsen","Matthew Skala"],"meta":["July 2016Information Systems 64","DOI:10.1016/j.is.2016.07.006"],"references":["262240658_Real-Time_Recommendation_of_Diverse_Related_Articles","241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation","225534605_A_New_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Constraint_Satisfaction_and_Its_Implications","1961276_Approximate_Graph_Coloring_by_Semidefinite_Programming","319770399_Approximate_nearest_neighbors_towards_removing_the_curse_of_dimensionality","312454102_Covering_the_sphere_by_equal_spherical_balls","301212672_Me_Myself_and_I","300341610_Approximate_Furthest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensions","288041090_The_MovieLens_Datasets","282844289_On_the_Complexity_of_Inner_Product_Similarity_Join","267017487_Covering_the_Sphere_by_Equal_Spherical_Balls","266657758_Composable_core-sets_for_diversity_and_coverage_maximization","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","246795749_Measuring_the_dimensionality_of_metric_spaces","241677884_User-Centric_Evaluation_of_a_K-Furthest_Neighbor_Collaborative_FilteringRecommender_Algorithm","238711009_Aspects_of_Metric_Spaces_in_Computation","227619265_On_variants_of_the_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_lemma","226714951_A_Subexponential_Bound_for_Linear_Programming","225470892_Dynamic_Euclidean_minimum_spanning_trees_and_extrema_of_binary_functions","223813319_Farthest_neighbors_maximum_spanning_trees_and_related_problems_in_higher_dimensions","220991597_Dynamic_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Neighbor_Searching","220780590_Better_algorithms_for_high-dimensional_proximity_problems_via_asymmetric_embeddings","220639820_Approximate_minimum_enclosing_balls_in_high_dimensions_using_core-sets","220556636_Optimal_core-sets_for_balls","215458558_Locality-sensitive_hashing_scheme_based_on_p-stable_distributions","3593086_Approximate_Graph_Coloring_by_Semidefinite_Programming","2784691_Las_Vegas_Algorithms_for_Linear_and_Integer_Programming_When_the_Dimension_is_Small","2430661_Reductions_Among_High_Dimensional_Proximity_Problems","2320094_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_Towards_Removing_the_Curse_of_Dimensionality"]}
