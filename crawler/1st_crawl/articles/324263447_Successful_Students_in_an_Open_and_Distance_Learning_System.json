{"id":"324263447_Successful_Students_in_an_Open_and_Distance_Learning_System","abstract":"Learning in a higher education institution that applies an open and distance learning system requires the students to study as independent learners. This research is a survey research with the purpose of exploring the characteristics, habits and learning motivation of high-achiever students or those who obtained a high level of Grade Point Average (GPA). The sample used in this study was Universitas Terbuka (UT) students of Non Elementary Education Programs who had completed at least four semesters and had obtained a GPA of 2.50 or higher. This study discovered that the high-achiever students were younger students of the average age of 29 years. Most of these higher achiever students were highly motivated to study and were studying at UT to support their career development. They usually studied 3-4 hours/for each course each day. Interviews showed that students generally did the self-assessment tests and they regularly attended the tutorials. The time of study (p=.001) and methods of study (p=.01) recorded in this study have the potential to contribute to the studentsâ€™ GPA.","authors":["Kristanti Puspitasari","Boedhi Oetoyo"],"meta":["April 2018Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education 19(2)","DOI:10.17718/tojde.415837","Project: Distance Education"],"references":["312043344_Learner_Profiling_Towards_Improving_Learner_Success","288438943_Who_am_I_and_What_Keeps_Me_Going_Profiling_the_Distance_Learning_Student_in_Higher_Education","287323061_Factors_Driving_Learner_Success_in_Online_Professional_Development","277861379_Motivation_Levels_among_Traditional_and_Open_Learning_Undergraduate_Students_in_India","264155280_Attributes_of_students'_success_and_failure_in_typical_ODL_institutions","281309155_Is_Choice_Important_in_Distance_Learning_A_Study_of_Student_Motives_for_Taking_Internet-Based_Courses_at_the_High_School_and_Community_College_Levels","280758090_Motivational_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","277494560_Factors_Influencing_Completion_and_Noncompletion_of_Community_College_Online_Courses","267549635_Self_Regulated_Learners_and_Distance_Education_Theory","253832946_The_Role_of_Self-Regulated_Learning_in_Fostering_Students'_Conceptual_Understanding_of_Complex_Systems_with_Hypermedia"]}
