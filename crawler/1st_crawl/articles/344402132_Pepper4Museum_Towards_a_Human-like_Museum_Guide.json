{"id":"344402132_Pepper4Museum_Towards_a_Human-like_Museum_Guide","abstract":"With the recent advances in technology, new ways to engage visitors in a museum have been proposed. Relevant examples range from the simple use of mobile apps and interactive displays to virtual and augmented reality settings. Recently social robots have been used as a solution to engage visitors in museum tours, due to their ability to interact with humans naturally and familiarly. In this paper, we present our preliminary work on the use of a social robot, Pepper in this case, as an innovative approach to engaging people during museum visiting tours. To this aim, we endowed Pepper with a vision module that allows it to perceive the visitor and the artwork he is looking at, as well as estimating his age and gender. These data are used to provide the visitor with recommendations about artworks the user might like to see during the visit. We tested the proposed approach in our research lab and preliminary experiments show its feasibility.","authors":["Giovanna Castellano","Berardina De Carolis","Nicola Macchiarulo","Gennaro Vessio"],"meta":["September 2020","Conference: Workshop on Advanced Visual Interfaces and Interactions in Cultural Heritage (AVI2CH 2020)At: Island of Ischia, ItalyVolume: CEUR Worksop Proceedings Vol-2687","Project: Understanding Visual Arts with AI"],"references":["341970651_Ensembling_complex_network_'perspectives'_for_mild_cognitive_impairment_detection_with_artificial_neural_networks","333862377_Cultural_heritage_visits_supported_on_visitors'_preferences_and_mobile_devices","333740869_Do_BCIs_Detect_User's_Engagement_The_Results_of_an_Empirical_Experiment_with_Emotional_Artworks","328007381_Comparison_of_Various_SLAM_Systems_for_Mobile_Robot_in_an_Indoor_Environment","323593816_A_Multi-Modal_Person_Recognition_System_for_Social_Robots","323500358_Special_issue_on_advanced_interfaces_for_cultural_heritage","341196442_Communicability_distance_reveals_hidden_patterns_of_Alzheimer_disease","329740282_MobileNetV2_Inverted_Residuals_and_Linear_Bottlenecks","327995202_Experiences_in_Using_the_Pepper_Robotic_Platform_for_Museum_Assistance_Applications","319346802_The_potential_for_tourism_and_hospitality_experience_research_in_human-robot_interactions"]}
