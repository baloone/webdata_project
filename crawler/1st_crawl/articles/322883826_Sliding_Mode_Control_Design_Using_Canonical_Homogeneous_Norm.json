{"id":"322883826_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_Using_Canonical_Homogeneous_Norm","abstract":"The problem of sliding mode control design for a nonlinear plant is studied. The necessary and sufficient conditions of quadratic-like stability (stabilizability) for a nonlinear homogeneous (control) system are obtained. Sufficient conditions of robust stability/stabilizability are deduced. The results are supported with academic examples of sliding mode control design.","authors":["Andrey Polyakov"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control 29(25)","DOI:10.1002/rnc.4058"],"references":["304410411_Stabilization_of_Chain_of_Integrators_with_Arbitrary_Order_in_Finite-time","268552203_Attractive_Ellipsoids_in_Robust_Control","243093489_Stabilizability_Does_Not_Imply_Homogeneous_Stabilizability_for_Controllable_Homogeneous_Systems","239064283_Sliding_Order_and_Sliding_Accuracy_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","226631857_Homogeneous_Lyapunov_functions_and_necessary_conditions_for_stabilization","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","30938087_Finite_time_stability_of_differential_inclusions","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","3033027_Finite-Time_Observers_Application_to_Secure_Communication","3032243_Quasi-continuous_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","2637744_Time-varying_Exponential_Stabilization_of_Nonholonomic_Systems_in_Power_Form","324216818_Attractive_ellipsoids_in_robust_control","322668802_Quadratic-like_stability_of_nonlinear_homogeneous_systems","316471045_Advanced_Mathematical_Tools_for_Automatic_Control_Engineers_Volume_2","314244633_A_note_on_delay_robustness_for_homogeneous_systems_with_negative_degree","312110558_On_finite-time_stabilization_of_evolution_equations_A_homogeneous_approach","305394986_A_universal_construction_of_Artstein's_theorem_on_nonlinear_stabilization","293014912_On_Homogeneous_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","285845276_Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_United_States_of_America","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284491471_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_uniform_homogeneous_right-hand_sides","279375353_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_Optimization","279357913_Sliding_Modes_in_Control_and_Optimization","271141391_Robust_Stabilization_of_MIMO_Systems_in_FiniteFixed_Time","267928734_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_stabilization_Implicit_Lyapunov_function_approach","267071257_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Nonlinear_Systems","264235292_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","261051805_DFK_control_design_for_nonlinear_systems","256430633_Adding_an_integrator_for_the_stabilization_problem","246503740_Interior_Point_Algorithms_in_Convex_Programming","246104580_Etude_de_quelques_problemes_de_stabilisation","245217922_Homogeneous_feedback_controls_for_homogeneous_systems","243782426_Introduction_to_calculus_and_analysis_Vol_I","243774453_Nilpotent_Approximations_of_Control_Systems_and_Distributions","230873496_Sliding_Mode_in_Control_Optimization","230725447_Interior-point_polynomial_algorithms_in_convex_programming","224579907_Homogeneous_Stabilization_for_Input_Affine_Homogeneous_Systems","222738859_Global_stability_of_homogeneous_vector_fields_of_odd_degree","222479166_Homogenous_Lyapunov_function_for_homogenous_continuous_vector_field","221658469_Methods_of_A_M_Lyapunov_and_Their_Application","221658425_The_Stability_of_Motion","220259790_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Robust_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems","220259489_Homogeneous_State_Feedback_Stabilization_of_Homogenous_Systems","220045336_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities_in_System_and_Control_Theory","48417854_Oscillations_Conditions_in_Homogenous_Systems","44376017_Semigroups_of_Linear_Operators_and_Applications_to_Partial_Differential_Equations","30846679_Geometric_homogeneity_with_application_to_finite-time_stability","11742692_The_role_of_symmetry_in_fundamental_physics","3732390_Generalized_weighted_homogeneity_and_state_dependent_time_scale_for_linear_controllable_systems"]}
