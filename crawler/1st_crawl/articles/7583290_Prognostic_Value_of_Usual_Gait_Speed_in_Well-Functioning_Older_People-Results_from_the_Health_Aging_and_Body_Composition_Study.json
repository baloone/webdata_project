{"id":"7583290_Prognostic_Value_of_Usual_Gait_Speed_in_Well-Functioning_Older_People-Results_from_the_Health_Aging_and_Body_Composition_Study","abstract":"To define clinically relevant cutpoints for usual gait speed and to investigate their predictive value for health-related events in older persons.\nProspective cohort study.\nHealth, Aging and Body Composition Study.\nThree thousand forty-seven well-functioning older persons (mean age 74.2).\nUsual gait speed on a 6-m course was assessed at baseline. Participants were randomly divided into two groups to identify (Sample A; n=2,031) and then validate (Sample B; n=1,016) usual gait-speed cutpoints. Rates of persistent lower extremity limitation events (mean follow-up 4.9 years) were calculated according to gait speed in Sample A. A cutpoint (defining high- (< 1 m/s) and low risk (> or = 1 m/s) groups) was identified based on persistent lower extremity limitation events. The predictive value of the identified cutpoints for major health-related events (persistent severe lower extremity limitation, death, and hospitalization) was evaluated in Sample B using Cox regression analyses.\nA graded response was seen between risk groups and health-related outcomes. Participants in the high-risk group had a higher risk of persistent lower extremity limitation (rate ratio (RR)=2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.76-2.74), persistent severe lower extremity limitation (RR=2.29, 95% CI=1.63-3.20), death (RR=1.64, 95% CI=1.14-2.37), and hospitalization (RR=1.48, 95% CI=1.02-2.13) than those in the low-risk group.\nUsual gait speed of less than 1 m/s identifies persons at high risk of health-related outcomes in well-functioning older people. Provision of a clinically meaningful cutpoint for usual gait speed may facilitate its use in clinical and research settings.","authors":["Matteo Cesari","Stephen Kritchevsky","B.W.
