{"id":"315631129_Solitary_perturbations_in_the_steep_boundary_of_magnetized_toroidal_plasma","abstract":"Solitary perturbations (SPs) localized both poloidally and radially are detected within ~100 Î¼s before the partial collapse of the high pressure gradient boundary region (called pedestal) of magnetized toroidal plasma in the KSTAR tokamak device. The SP develops with a low toroidal mode number (typically unity) in the pedestal ingrained with quasi-stable edge-localized mode (QSM) which commonly appears during the inter-collapse period. The SPs have smaller mode pitch and different (often opposite) rotation velocity compared to the QSMs. Similar solitary perturbations are also frequently observed before the onset of complete pedestal collapse, suggesting a strong connection between the SP generation and the pedestal collapse.","authors":["J.
