{"id":"310436992_A_Nine_Year_Story_of_the_India_Software_Engineering_Conference_from_2008_to_2016","abstract":"The India Software Engineering Conference (ISEC) is an annual conference in the field of Software Engineering (SE) in India. ISEC started in the year 2008 and completed 9 years in 2016. The ISEC conference has evolved into a high-quality academic event for SE researchers from universities and industry in India with considerable international participation. Assessment and evaluation of ISEC conference quality, status and evolution is important for the national SE scientific community, ISEC steering committee, sponsors and science and technology-related government bodies. In this paper, we conduct scientific paper publication mining and scientometric and bibliometric analysis of 9 years of ISEC publications and programs. We conduct an in-depth multi-dimensional analysis of the conference across various aspects such as a summary of 9 years of ISEC programs (paper submission data, tutorials, workshops, keynotes, invited talks, geographical location, program and general chairs), author-affiliation-based geographical contribution (analysis at the international and national levels), topic analysis, university and industry collaborations, contributions across university types in India, prolific and new authors, gender equality and imbalance, program committee characteristics, open-source or closed-source datasets and citation-based impact. We also present our recommendations for future editions of the ISEC based on our comprehensive analysis study presented in this paper.","authors":["Richa Sharma","Ashish Sureka"],"meta":["November 2016ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes 41(5):31-44","DOI:10.1145/2994205.2994214"],"references":["308730215_Citation_and_Topic_Analysis_of_the_ESEM_Papers","282524329_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_the_Turkish_software_engineering_research_community","220416307_Affiliation_analysis_of_database_publications","220416253_Citation_analysis_of_database_publications","220364855_Assessing_the_quality_of_scientific_conferences_based_on_bibliographic_citations","220302568_20_Years_of_four_HCI_conferences_A_Visual_Exploration","200508148_Scientometric_Analysis_Of_The_CHI_Proceedings","49814126_The_end_of_the_beginning_A_reflection_on_the_first_five_years_of_the_HRI_conference","43199344_A_Bibliometric_Assessment_of_Canadian_Software_Engineering_Scholars_and_Institutions_1996-2006","317919114_Minority_ethnic_groups_in_computer_science_research_what_is_the_bibliography_data_telling_us","311489660_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study_of_the_Current_Practice_of_Indian_Software_Engineering","305042502_A_glance_at_seven_ACM_SIGWEB_series_of_conferences","303092818_Insights_from_Mining_Eleven_Years_of_Scholarly_Paper_Publications_in_Requirements_Engineering_RE_Series_of_Conferences","299548146_Women_in_computer_science_research","282902941_University-industry_collaboration_and_Open_Source_Software_OSS_dataset_in_Mining_Software_Repositories_MSR_research","260480606_Assessment_of_Institutions_Scholars_and_Contributions_on_Agile_Software_Development_2001-2012","254003917_A_quantitative_analysis_of_WWW_hypertext_and_JCDL_conferences_in_the_last_decade","221469949_Ten_Years_of_Search_Based_Software_Engineering_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","220923838_Measuring_Conference_Quality_by_Mining_Program_Committee_Characteristics"]}
