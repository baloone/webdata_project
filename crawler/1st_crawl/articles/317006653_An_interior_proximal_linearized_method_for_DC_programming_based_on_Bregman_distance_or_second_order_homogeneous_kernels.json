{"id":"317006653_An_interior_proximal_linearized_method_for_DC_programming_based_on_Bregman_distance_or_second_order_homogeneous_kernels","abstract":"We present an interior proximal method for solving constrained nonconvex optimiza- tion problems where the objective function is given by the difference of two convex function (DC function). To this end, we consider a linearized proximal method with a proximal distance as regularization. Convergence analysis of particular choices of the proximal distance as second order homogeneous proximal distances and Bregman distances are considered. Finally, some academic numerical results are presented for a constrained DC problem and generalized Fermat-Weber location problems.","authors":["Jo√£o Carlos Souza","Joao Xavier da Cruz Neto","Paulo Santos","Jurandir O Lopes"],"meta":["May 2018Optimization 68(8)","DOI:10.1080/02331934.2018.1476859"],"references":["313248914_Double_Bundle_Method_for_Nonsmooth_DC_Optimization","311855067_A_proximal_bundle_method_for_nonsmooth_DC_optimization_utilizing_nonconvex_cutting_planes","301550980_A_generalized_proximal_linearized_algorithm_for_DC_functions_with_application_to_the_optimal_size_of_the_firm_problem","299403112_Generalized_Proximal_Distances_for_Bilevel_Equilibrium_Problems","282450498_A_minimization_algorithm_for_equilibrium_problems_with_polyhedral_constraints","275659470_Global_convergence_of_a_proximal_linearized_algorithm_for_difference_of_convex_functions","266829234_An_Inexact_Hybrid_Generalized_Proximal_Point_Algorithm_and_Some_New_Results_on_the_Theory_of_Bregman_Functions","313876742_Proximiteet_dualite_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","272403756_Interior_proximal_extragradient_method_for_equilibrium_problems","268553101_Generalized_Differentiability_Duality_and_Optimization_for_Problems_Dealing_with_Differences_of_Convex_Functions","257604983_Interior_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Quasiconvex_Programming_Problems_and_Variational_Inequalities_with_Linear_Constraints","257179982_On_a_generalized_proximal_point_method_for_solving_equilibrium_problems_in_Banach_spaces","250889899_A_Method_for_Minimization_of_Quasidifferentiable_Functions","266036918_Algorithms_for_Solving_a_Class_of_Nonconvex_Optimization_Problems_Methods_of_Subgradients","265814839_Proximal_point_algorithm_for_minimization_of_DC_function"]}
