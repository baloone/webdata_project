We first propose a modified Binary Log-Linear Learning (BLLL) algorithm that can achieve a better performance and higher learning rate when is compared to standard BLLL. However, due to a number of assumptions, practical applicability of a LLL-based algorithm is limited. To relax this limitation we then propose a modified QL algorithm that can achieve the same performance but with the price of lower learning rate. The algorithms proposed are tested numerically.","authors":["Mohammadhosein Hasanbeig","Lacra Pavel"],"meta":["July 2017IFAC-PapersOnLine 50(1):8987-8992","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1326"],"references":[]}
