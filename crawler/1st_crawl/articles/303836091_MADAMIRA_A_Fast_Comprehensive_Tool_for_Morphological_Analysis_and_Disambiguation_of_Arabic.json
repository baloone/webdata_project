{"id":"303836091_MADAMIRA_A_Fast_Comprehensive_Tool_for_Morphological_Analysis_and_Disambiguation_of_Arabic","abstract":"In this paper, we present MADAMIRA, a system for morphological analysis and disambiguation of Arabic that combines some of the best aspects of two previously commonly used systems for Arabic processing, MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Habash et al., 2009; Habash et al., 2013) and AMIRA (Diab et al., 2007). MADAMIRA improves upon the two systems with a more streamlined Java implementation that is more robust, portable, extensible, and is faster than its ancestors by more than an order of magnitude. We also discuss an online demo (see http://nlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/madamira/) that highlights these aspects.","authors":["A. Pasha","Mohamed Elbadrashiny","Mona Diab","A.
