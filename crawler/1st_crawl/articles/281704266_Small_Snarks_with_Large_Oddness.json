{"id":"281704266_Small_Snarks_with_Large_Oddness","abstract":"We estimate the minimum number of vertices of a cubic graph with given oddness and cyclic connectivity. We prove that a bridgeless cubic graph G with oddness ω(G) other than the Petersen graph has at least 5:41 ω(G) vertices, and for each integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ 6 we construct an in_nite family of cubic graphs with cyclic connectivity k and small oddness ratio |V (G)|/ω(G). In particular, for cyclic connectivity 2, 4, 5, and 6 we improve the upper bounds on the oddness ratio of snarks to 7:5, 13, 25, and 99 from the known values 9, 15, 76, and 118, respectively. In addition, we construct a cyclically 4-connected snark of girth 5 with oddness 4 on 44 vertices, improving the best previous value of 46.","authors":["Robert Lukot’ka","Edita Mácajová","Ján Mazák","Martin Škoviera"],"meta":["February 2015The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 22(1)","DOI:10.37236/3969"],"references":["265356925_Atoms_of_cyclic_connectivity_in_cubic_graphs","220532674_Cycles_Intersecting_Edge-Cuts_of_Prescribed_Sizes","220193033_Measurements_of_edge-uncolorability","220188975_Classifications_and_characterizations_of_snarks","228083483_Generation_and_Properties_of_Snarks","225660001_Die_Theorie_der_Regularen_Graphs","223012501_Superposition_and_Constructions_of_Graphs_Without_Nowhere-zero_k-flows","222865787_Five_Cycle_Double_Covers_of_Some_Cubic_Graphs","220345201_Almost_All_Cubic_Graphs_Are_Hamiltonian","220189978_The_number_of_cycles_in_2-factors_of_cubic_graphs","220076439_Covering_weighted_graphs_by_even_subgraphs","220074799_Double_covers_of_cubic_graphs_with_oddness_4"]}
