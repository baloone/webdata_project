{"id":"321344471_Moulding_student_emotions_through_computational_psychology_affective_learning_technologies_and_algorithmic_governance","abstract":"Recently psychology has begun to amalgamate with computer science approaches to big data analysis as a new field of “computational psychology” or “psycho-informatics,” as well as with new “psycho-policy” approaches associated with behaviour change science, in ways that propose new ways of measuring, administering and managing individuals and populations. In particular, “social-emotional learning” has become a new focus within education. Supporters of social-emotional learning foresee technical systems being employed to quantify and govern learners’ affective lives, and to modify their behaviours in the direction of “positive” feelings. In this article I identify the core aspirations of computational psychology in education, along with the technical systems it proposes to enact its vision, and argue that a new form of “psycho-informatic power” is emerging as a source of authority and control over education.","authors":["Ben Williamson"],"meta":["November 2017Educational Media International 54(1):1-22","DOI:10.1080/09523987.2017.1407080"],"references":["341025308_Dossier_4_Wiener_Symposium_Padagogik_der_Achtsamkeit_2017","318459137_Data_politics","346918527_The_Brain's_Body_Neuroscience_and_Corporeal_Politics","338750109_Big_Data_in_Education_The_digital_future_of_learning_policy_and_practice","330328817_Invisible_Images_Your_Pictures_Are_Looking_at_You","327834596_The_Ontological_Imperative_When_Researching_in_the_Digital_Age","323321894_The_Birth_of_Biopolitics_Lectures_at_the_College_De_France_1978-1979","317281788_Affective_capture_in_digital_school_spaces_and_the_modulation_of_student_subjectivities","314781774_Media_Technologies_-_Essays_on_Communication_Materiality_and_Society","313748370_Quantified_Biosensing_technologies_in_everyday_life"]}
