{"id":"318155236_Developing_an_Integrative_STEM_Curriculum_for_Robotics_Education_Through_Educational_Design_Research","abstract":"This paper presents an integrative standards-based STEM curriculum that uses robots to develop studentsâ€™ computational thinking. The need for the project is rooted in both the overall lack of existing materials as well as the need for materials that directly address specific STEM standards in an integrative fashion. The paper details the first mesocycle of an educational design research project (EDR) in which a robust theoretical framework was created to support the development of a 2-week series of robotics lessons. Analysis of evaluation data from 5 fifth-grade teachers and their students revealed that the integrative curriculum supported student problem solving and teacher practices that supported cognitive demand. Implications for research, design, and instruction are discussed.","authors":["T. J. Kopcha","J. McGregor","S. Shin","Y.
