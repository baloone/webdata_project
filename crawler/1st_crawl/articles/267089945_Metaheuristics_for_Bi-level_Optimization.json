{"id":"267089945_Metaheuristics_for_Bi-level_Optimization","abstract":"This book provides a complete background on metaheuristics to solve complex bi-level optimization problems (continuous/discrete, mono-objective/multi-objective) in a diverse range of application domains. Readers learn to solve large scale bi-level optimization problems by efficiently combining metaheuristics with complementary metaheuristics and mathematical programming approaches. Numerous real-world examples of problems demonstrate how metaheuristics are applied in such fields as networks, logistics and transportation, engineering design, finance and security.","authors":["El-Ghazali Talbi"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-37838-6","ISBN: 978-3-642-37837-9"],"references":[]}
