Information modeling is represented by several researchers as a means of forming interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, universal educational actions of pupils, which is of great methodological significance for the school course of Informatics. In this regard, the professional training of a teacher of informatics is subject to additional requirements related to understanding metasubject and fundamental knowledge in the field of information modeling, the importance of information and analytical activities on the basis of sign-symbolic formal or semi-formal models in solving problems of the subject field, professional sphere. Within the selected approaches in the training of future teachers of computer science information modeling, the results of the study have been analyzed and the importance of using graphs as a special symbolic and modeling structures has been shown, the process of information modeling using graphs in pedagogical design, for example, in designing the educational process, designing digital educational resources, has been updated. The results of the study components of information and analytical activities in the process of information modeling and its value for solving problems in the subject area and / or the professional sphere, as a consequence, formation on this basis of information-analytical competence of teachers of computer science have been analyzed. The analysis shows the directions of the development of the content of training in the field of information modeling, as well as the new approach that has been studied to select and structure the content of training within the framework of the construction of the methodological system. The formation of readiness for information and analytical activities of the teacher of informatics has been updated.","authors":["E.V.
