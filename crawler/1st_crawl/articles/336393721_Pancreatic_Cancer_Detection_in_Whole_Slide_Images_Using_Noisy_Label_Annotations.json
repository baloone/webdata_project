{"id":"336393721_Pancreatic_Cancer_Detection_in_Whole_Slide_Images_Using_Noisy_Label_Annotations","abstract":"We propose an approach to accurately predict regions of pancreatic cancer in whole-slide images (WSIs) by leveraging a relatively large, but noisy, dataset. We employ a noisy label classification (NLC) method (called the NLC model) that utilizes a small set of clean training samples and assigns the appropriate weights to training samples to deal with sample noise. The weights are assigned online so that the network loss approximates the loss for the clean samples. This method results in a 9.7% performance improvement over the baseline non-NLC method (the Baseline-Noisy model). We use both methods in an ensemble setup to generate labels for a large training dataset to train a classifier. This classifier outperforms a classifier trained with manually annotated data by 2.94%–3.74% in terms of AUC for testing patches in WSIs.","authors":["Han Le","Dimitris Samaras","Tahsin Kurc","Rajarsi Gupta"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-32239-7_60","In book: Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2019 (pp.541-549)"],"references":["339784694_Learning_from_Noisy_Label_Statistics_Detecting_High_Grade_Prostate_Cancer_in_Ultrasound_Guided_Biopsy","327629848_Invasive_Cancer_Detection_Utilizing_Compressed_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Transfer_Learning_21st_International_Conference_Granada_Spain_September_16-20_2018_Proceedings_Part_II","324055192_Learning_to_Reweight_Examples_for_Robust_Deep_Learning","321059022_Identification_of_unique_neoantigen_qualities_in_long-term_survivors_of_pancreatic_cancer","317673956_A_Closer_Look_at_Memorization_in_Deep_Networks","230679408_The_Pancreas_Cancer_Microenvironment","334417349_Robust_Learning_at_Noisy_Labeled_Medical_Images_Applied_to_Skin_Lesion_Classification","329744292_Joint_Optimization_Framework_for_Learning_with_Noisy_Labels","327610936_Learning_from_Noisy_Label_Statistics_Detecting_High_Grade_Prostate_Cancer_in_Ultrasound_Guided_Biopsy","325573858_Classification_of_Breast_Cancer_Histology_Using_Deep_Learning","325526058_Training_a_neural_network_based_on_unreliable_human_annotation_of_medical_images","320966894_Making_Deep_Neural_Networks_Robust_to_Label_Noise_A_Loss_Correction_Approach","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks"]}
