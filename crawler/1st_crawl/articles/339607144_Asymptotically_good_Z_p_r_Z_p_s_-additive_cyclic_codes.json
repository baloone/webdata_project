{"id":"339607144_Asymptotically_good_Z_p_r_Z_p_s_-additive_cyclic_codes","abstract":"We construct a class of ZprZps-additive cyclic codes generated by pairs of polynomials, where p is a prime number. Based on probabilistic arguments, we determine the asymptotic rates and relative distances of this class of codes: the asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound at 1+ps−r2δ is greater than 12 and the relative distance of the code is convergent to δ, while the rate is convergent to 11+ps−r for 0<δ<11+ps−r and 1≤r<s. As a consequence, we prove that there exist numerous asymptotically good ZprZps-additive cyclic codes.","authors":["Ting Yao","Shixin Zhu","Xiaoshan Kai"],"meta":["March 2020Finite Fields and Their Applications 63(3):101633","DOI:10.1016/j.ffa.2020.101633","Project: Algebra Coding"],"references":["329332239_On_ZpZpk-additive_codes_and_their_duality","326860837_Asymptotically_Good_Additive_Cyclic_Codes_Exist","322652442_Double_circulant_self-dual_and_LCD_codes_over_Galois_rings","278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","276211234_Quasi-cyclic_Codes_of_Index_15","243116177_Gilbert-Varshamov_type_bounds_for_linear_codes_over_finite_chain_rings","241278773_Thresholds_of_Random_Quasi-Abelian_Codes","334142374_Double_circulant_LCD_codes_over_Z_4","319960558_Asymptotically_good_quasi-cyclic_codes_of_fractional_index","312115996_Generalization_of_the_Lee_weight_to_Zpk","311883560_On_constacyclic_codes_over_Z4uu2-1_and_their_Gray_images","292679502_Quasi-twisted_codes_with_constacyclic_constituent_codes","290263491_Good_Self-dual_Generalized_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_Exist","266309008_New_lower_bounds_for_the_minimal_distance_of_linear_quasicyclic_and_almost_linear_cyclic_codes","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","235008628_Estimate_of_the_number_of_signals_in_error_correcting_codes","220246892_Some_Results_on_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes","3086488_Self-Dual_Doubly_Even_2-Quasi-Cyclic_Transitive_Codes_Are_Asymptotically_Good","3085909_Some_randomized_code_constructions_from_group_actions","3084700_Good_self-dual_quasi-cyclic_codes_exist","3082431_A_Gilbert-Varshamov_bound_for_quasi-cycle_codes_of_rate_12_Corresp"]}
