{"id":"271605970_Developing_students'_reasoning_about_samples_and_sampling_in_the_context_of_informal_inferences","abstract":"The expanding use of data in modern society for prediction and decision-making makes it a priority for mathematics instruction to help students build sound foundations of inferential reasoning at a young age. This study contributes to the emerging research literature on the early development of informal inferential reasoning through the conduct of a two-phase exploratory study carried out in an urban upper elementary school (Grades 4 to 6) in Cyprus. In Phase I, Grade 6 (11-year-old) students’ initial understandings of samples and sampling were examined through an open-ended written assessment (n = 69), and follow-up interviews (n = 5). In Phase II, a teaching experiment guided by a hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT) was implemented in a Grade 6 classroom (n = 19). The HLT aimed to support the emergence of children’s reasoning about sampling issues through the provision of an inquiry-based learning environment designed to offer ample opportunities for informal, data-based inferences. Findings indicate that the efforts of the teaching experiment to integrate the existing body of research into a HLT that starts with children’s initial understandings supported students in moving towards more nuanced forms of reasoning about sampling.","authors":["Maria Meletiou-Mavrotheris","Efi Paparistodemou"],"meta":["March 2014Educational Studies in Mathematics 88(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10649-014-9551-5"],"references":["344702534_Learning_and_Teaching_Early_Math_The_Learning_Trajectories_Approach","283288212_Developing_young_students'_informal_inference_skills_in_data_analysis","258933027_Learning_Trajectories_in_Mathematics_A_Foundation_for_Standards_Curriculum_Assessment_and_Instruction","247358846_Reconstructing_Mathematics_Pedagogy_from_a_Constructivist_Perspective","239920459_A_FRAMEWORK_FOR_THINKING_ABOUT_INFORMAL_STATISTICAL_INFERENCE7","233152291_Explanations_and_Context_in_the_Emergence_of_Students'_Informal_Inferential_Reasoning","227157264_Supporting_Students'_Ability_to_Reason_about_Data","225807826_Diagrammatic_Reasoning_as_the_Basis_for_Developing_Concepts_A_Semiotic_Analysis_of_Students'_Learning_about_Statistical_Distribution","225366585_Data_modelling_with_first-grade_students","49516847_The_Role_of_Context_in_Developing_Reasoning_about_Informal_Statistical_Inference","46654588_Design_research_in_statistics_education_on_symbolizing_and_computer_tools","44839789_Learning_and_teaching_early_math_The_learning_trajectories_approach","37515878_Local_and_Global_Thinking_in_Statistical_Inference","317953357_The_discovery_of_grounded_theory","288309367_Statistical_Literacy_at_School_Growth_and_Goals","285108203_Equipartitioningsplitting_as_a_foundation_of_rational_number_reasoning_using_learning_trajectories","281371154_Learning_about_sampling_Trouble_at_the_core_of_statistics","259258513_The_Discovery_of_Ground_Theory","248102865_TinkerPlots_Dynamic_Data_Exploration","246389561_How_Do_Students_Think_about_Statistical_Sampling_before_Instruction","245907682_Developing_concepts_of_sampling_JRME_311_44-70","233635904_Introductory_statistics_college_student_attitudes_and_knowledge_-_A_qualitative_analysis_of_the_impact_of_technology-based_instruction","225202960_The_Beginning_of_Statistical_Inference_Comparing_two_Data_Sets"]}
