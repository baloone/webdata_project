{"id":"309277340_Parallel_Quick_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem_Using_OpenMP","abstract":"String matching is seen as one of the essential ‎problems in computer science. A variety of computer applications ‎provide the string matching service for their end users. The ‎remarkable boost in the number of data that is created ‎and kept by modern computational devices influences ‎researchers to obtain even more powerful methods for coping ‎with this problem. In this research, the Quick Search string ‎matching algorithm are embrace to be implemented under the multi-core environment using OpenMP directive which can be employed to ‎reduce the over-all execution time of the program. English text, Proteins and DNA ‎data types are utilized to examine the effect of parallelization and ‎implementation of Quick Search string matching algorithm on ‎ multi-core based environment. Experimental outcomes reveal ‎that the overall performance of the mentioned string ‎matching algorithm has been improved, as well as the improvement in the execution time ‎which has been obtained is considerable enough to recommend the ‎multi-core environment as the suitable platform for ‎parallelization the Quick Search string matching algorithm.","authors":["Sinan Sameer Mahmood Al-Dabbagh","Nawaf Hazim","Mustafa Abdul Sahib Naser","Zaid G.
