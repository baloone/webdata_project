{"id":"222738212_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_with_Classification_Based_on_Feature_Distributions","abstract":"This paper evaluates the performance both of some texture measures which have been successfully used in various applications and of some new promising approaches proposed recently. For classification a method based on Kullback discrimination of sample and prototype distributions is used. The classification results for single features with one-dimensional feature value distributions and for pairs of complementary features with two-dimensional distributions are presented","authors":["Timo Ojala","Matti Pietik√§inen","David Harwood"],"meta":["January 1996Pattern Recognition 29(1):51-59","DOI:10.1016/0031-3203(95)00067-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220632078_Texture_analysis_Anno_1983","312947567_A_comparative_study_of_texture_measures_for_terrain_classification","253744746_Experiments_with_two_industrial_problems_using_texture_classification_based_on_feature_distributions","244461491_Experiments_with_texture_Classification_Using_Averages_of_Local_Pattern_Matches","238684297_Textures_a_photographic_album_for_artists_and_designers","235102752_Textured_Image_Segmentation","224377938_Sum_and_Difference_Histograms_for_Texture_Classification","224112430_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_for_Terrain_Classification","223521442_Texture_feature_performance_of_image_segmentation","223306703_Performance_evaluation_for_four_class_of_texture_features","222485717_Texture_classification_by_center-symmetric_auto-correlation_using_Kullback_discrimination_of_distributions","222326537_Texture_classification_using_texture_spectrum","220645158_Feature_frequency_matrices_as_texture_image_representation","50336131_Information_Theory_And_Statistics","44360813_Information_theory_and_statistics_Solomon_Kullback"]}
