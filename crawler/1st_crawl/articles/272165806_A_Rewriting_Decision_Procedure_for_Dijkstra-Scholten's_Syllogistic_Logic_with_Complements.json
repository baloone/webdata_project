{"id":"272165806_A_Rewriting_Decision_Procedure_for_Dijkstra-Scholten's_Syllogistic_Logic_with_Complements","abstract":"We present an equational decision procedure `a la Dijkstra & Scholten for the ‘Syllogis-\ntic Logic with Complements’. First, we give an equational axiomatization of Dijkstra\n& Scholten’s propositional logic and show how it gives a decision procedure for propo-\nsitional logic by equational term rewriting. We also show how one can efficiently obtain\ncertain propositional models (i.e., truth assignments over propositional variables) from\nthe canonical forms given by the system. We then present the Syllogistic Logic with\nComplements and show how the decision procedure for propositional logic can be easily\nextended to obtain a decision procedure for this subset of First-Order Logic. Moreover,\nan executable specification of both decision procedures is presented in the Maude sys-\ntem, and examples illustrating the use of both canonical equational systems are given.","authors":["Camilo Rocha","Jose Meseguer"],"meta":["December 2007"],"references":["226598943_Syllogistic_Logic_with_Complements","284439893_Aristotle's_Syllogistic_from_the_Standpoint_of_Modern_Formal_Logic","278713335_A_Logical_Approach_to_Discrete_Math","278657463_A_Logical_Approach_to_Discrete_Math","245738620_Computability_and_Logic","243768867_Conditional_rewriting_as_a_uni_ed_model_of_concurrency","239665532_Introduction_to_Topology_and_Modern_Analysis","234816303_Topics_in_automated_theorem_proving_and_program_generation","234806269_Computability_and_logic","234755427_Predicate_Calculus_and_Program_Semantics"]}
