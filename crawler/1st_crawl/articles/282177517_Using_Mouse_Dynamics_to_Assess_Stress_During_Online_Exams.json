{"id":"282177517_Using_Mouse_Dynamics_to_Assess_Stress_During_Online_Exams","abstract":"Stress is a highly complex, subjective and multidimensional phenomenon. Nonetheless, it is also one of our strongest driving forces, pushing us forward and preparing our body and mind to tackle the daily challenges, independently of their nature. The duality of the effects of stress, that can have positive or negative effects, calls for approaches that can take the best out of this biological mechanism, providing means for people to cope effectively with stress. In this paper we propose an approach, based on mouse dynamics, to assess the level of stress of students during online exams. Results show that mouse dynamics change in a consistent manner as stress settles in, allowing for its estimation from the analysis of the mouse usage. This approach will allow to understand how each individual student is affected by stress, providing additional valuable information for educational institutions to efficiently adapt and improve their teaching processes.","authors":["Davide Carneiro","Paulo Jorge Novais","José Miguel Pêgo","Nuno Sousa"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19644-2-29"],"references":["267963096_Medical_students'_self-report_of_mental_health_conditions","247836093_Behavioural_biometrics_A_survey_and_classification","242759434_Constructing_Written_Test_Questions_For_the_Basic_and_Clinical_Sciences","232223800_Brain_on_Stress_How_the_Social_Environment_Gets_under_the_Skin","228115061_Stress-induced_changes_in_human_decision-making_are_reversible","3308596_An_Introduction_to_Biometric_Recognition","2669468_Scaling_Up_the_Accuracy_of_Naive-Bayes_Classifiers_a_Decision-Tree_Hybrid","268625049_Detection_of_Distraction_and_Fatigue_in_Groups_through_the_Analysis_of_Interaction_Patterns_with_Computers","260299622_User_Authentication_Through_Mouse_Dynamics","221579363_Active_authentication_by_mouse_movements","23954047_Depressive_Symptoms_in_Medical_Students_and_Residents_A_Multischool_Study","7214429_Systematic_Review_of_Depression_Anxiety_and_Other_Indicators_of_Psychological_Distress_Among_US_and_Canadian_Medical_Students","4168237_Anomaly_intrusion_detection_based_on_biometrics"]}
