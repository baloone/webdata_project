{"id":"248382147_Functional_Graphs_of_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields","abstract":"Given a function $f$ in a finite field $\\F_q$ we define the functional graph\nof $f$ as a directed graph on $q$ nodes labelled by elements of $\\F_q$ where\nthere is an edge from $u$ to $v$ if and only if $f(u) = v$. We obtain some\ntheoretic estimates on the number of non-isomorphic graphs generated by all\npolynomials of a given degree. We then develop an algorithm to test the\nisomorphism of quadratic polynomials that has linear memory and time\ncomplexities. Furthermore we extend this isomorphism testing algorithm to the\ngeneral case of functional graphs, and prove that, while its time complexity\nincreases only slightly, its memory complexity remains linear. We exploit this\nalgorithm to provide an upper bound on the number of functional graphs\ncorresponding to polynomials of degree $d$ over $\\F_q$. Finally we present some\nnumerical results and compare function graphs of quadratic polynomials with\nthose generated by random maps and pose interesting new problems.","authors":["Sergei Konyagin","Florian Luca","Bernard Mans","Luke Mathieson"],"meta":["July 2013Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 116","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2015.07.003","SourcearXiv"],"references":["250389896_On_the_period_of_the_linear_congruential_and_power_generators","247921840_The_iterated_Carmichael_l-function_and_the_number_of_cycles_of_the_power_generator","220577073_Period_of_the_power_generator_and_small_values_of_Carmichael's_function","51916567_Periods_of_rational_maps_modulo_primes","274903870_Cycle_structure_of_power_mappings_in_a_residue_classes_ring","268669560_Diophantine_equations_over_function_fields","265307657_Analytic_Number_Theory","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","262276402_Random_Mappings_with_Restricted_Preimages","262155109_Satisfiability_and_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","257548765_The_structure_of_digraphs_associated_with_the_congruence_x_k_y_mod_n","257028381_Preperiodic_points_for_quadratic_polynomials_over_quadratic_fields","256774952_On_the_cycle_structure_of_repeated_exponentiation_modulo_a_prime","247334690_Rational_periodic_points_of_rational_functions","239060590_Prime_Numbers_A_Computational_Perspective","238848278_The_classification_of_rational_preperiodic_points_of_quadratic_polynomials_over_Bbb_Q_a_refined_conjecture","236589524_Benedetto's_trick_and_existence_of_rational_preperiodic_structures_for_quadratic_polynomials","234798469_Linear_time_algorithm_for_isomorphism_of_planar_graphs_Preliminary_Report","231882131_The_S-unit_equation_over_function_fields","230883331_Chebyshev_Action_on_Finite_Fields","230679941_On_the_Number_of_Distinct_Functional_Graphs_of_Affine-LinearTransformations_over_Finite_Fields","228395406_Arithmetic_properties_of_periodic_points_of_quadratic_maps_II","225651316_Equations_over_function_fields","225388635_An_Alternate_Proof_of_Mason's_Theorem","222626707_Toward_a_theory_of_Pollard's_rho_method","222543569_On_the_iteration_of_certain_quadratic_maps_over_GFp","222455066_Graph_isomorphism_general_remarks","221348604_Random_Mapping_Statistics","220173539_Phase_Transition_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Systems","215609889_Modern_Computer_Arithmetic","200034367_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Isomorphism_of_Planar_Graphs","51932391_Graph_components_and_dynamics_over_finite_fields","45881195_Monomial_Dynamical_Systems_of_Dimension_One_over_Finite_Fields","39765372_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching","39765370_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_vol_1_Fundamental_Algorithms","38347862_A_congruence_theorem_for_trees","31271933_Polynomial_identities_and_hauptmoduln","2895706_Random_Mapping_Statistics","2609728_Cycles_Of_Quadratic_Polynomials_And_Rational_Points_On_A_Genus_2_Curve","2138130_Cycles_of_Quadratic_Polynomials_and_Rational_Points_on_a_Genus-Two_Curve"]}
