{"id":"326429180_The_GreedEx_experience_Evolution_of_different_versions_for_the_learning_of_greedy_algorithms","abstract":"This paper presents the evolution experienced by GreedEx, an interactive application to learn greedy algorithms. It shows the four different versions currently available. A first original version for computers, two versions for iPad, and another version for smartphones. Besides, it describes the evaluation performed for each version, which has served so as to justify such evolution.","authors":["Yoel Arroyo","Ana Isabel Molina DÃ­az","Carmen Lacave","Miguel A.
