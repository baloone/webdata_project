{"id":"296550027_A_Survey_on_Big_Data_Analytics_Challenges_Open_Research_Issues_and_Tools","abstract":"A huge repository of terabytes of data is generated each day from modern information systems and digital technolo-gies such as Internet of Things and cloud computing. Analysis of these massive data requires a lot of efforts at multiple levels to extract knowledge for decision making. Therefore, big data analysis is a current area of research and development. The basic objective of this paper is to explore the potential impact of big data challenges, open research issues, and various tools associated with it. As a result, this article provides a platform to explore big data at numerous stages. Additionally, it opens a new horizon for researchers to develop the solution, based on the challenges and open research issues.","authors":["Debi Prasanna Acharjya","Kauser Ahmed P"],"meta":["February 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(2):511-518","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070267","Project: Big Data Analytics Challenges"],"references":["301389202_Bio-Inspired_Cost-Effective_Access_to_Big_Data","280225064_Swarm_Intelligence_in_Big_Data_Analytics","276248376_Beyond_the_hype_Big_data_concepts_methods_and_analytics","275484315_A_Review_of_Data_Mining_Using_Big_Data_in_Health_Informatics","316647322_BIG_Data_Analytics_A_Framework_for_Unstructured_Data_Analysis","301463141_Research_on_the_security_technology_of_big_data_information","298546744_Formal_concept_analysis_as_mathematical_theory_of_concepts_and_concept_hierarchies","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","282921767_Quality_Assessment_of_Data_Using_Statistical_and_Machine_Learning_Methods","279384963_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Factor_Analysis"]}
