Assume every man can do any of the n jobs. The two questions considered in this paper are 1 How to arrange a schedule that requires the minimum number of men so that all jobs are completed within a prescribed time T, and 2 if m men are available, arrange a schedule that completes all jobs at the earliest time.","authors":["T.
