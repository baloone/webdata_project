{"id":"318376303_Construction_of_Highly_Nonlinear_1-Resilient_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Provably_High_Fast_Algebraic_Immunity","abstract":"In 2013, Tang, Carlet and Tang [IEEE TIT 59(1): 653-664, 2013] presented two classes of Boolean functions. The functions in the first class are unbalanced and the functions in the second one are balanced. Both of those two classes of functions have high nonlinearity, high algebraic degree, optimal algebraic immunity, and high fast algebraic immunity. However, they are not 1-resilient which represents a drawback for their use as filter functions in stream ciphers. In this paper, we first propose a large family of 1-resilient Boolean functions having high lower bound on nonlinearity, optimal algebraic immunity, and optimal algebraic degree, that is, meeting the Siegenthaler bound. Most notably, we can mathematically prove that every function in n variables belonging to this family has fast algebraic immunity no less than nâ€“6, which is the first time that an infinite family of 1-resilient functions with provably high fast algebraic immunity has been invented. Further, we exhibit a subclass of the family which has higher lower bound on nonlinearity than all the known 1-resilient functions with (potentially) optimal algebraic immunity and potentially high fast algebraic immunity.","authors":["Deng Tang","Claude Carlet","Xiaohu Tang","Zhengchun Zhou"],"meta":["July 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2725918"],"references":["235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","224242544_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","224242489_Balanced_rotation_symmetric_boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","224138802_Constructions_of_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions_Using_Primitive_Polynomials","221355544_A_Larger_Class_of_Cryptographic_Boolean_Functions_via_a_Study_of_the_Maiorana-McFarland_Construction","221355541_On_Correlation-Immune_Functions","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","221348082_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Feedback","221327270_An_Infinite_Class_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_Good_Immunity_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Good_Nonlinearity","220942492_Improving_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","220942300_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions_Construction_and_Analysis_in_Terms_of_Algebraic_Immunity","220334944_On_a_generalized_combinatorial_conjecture_involving_addition_mod_2","220334210_Balanced_Boolean_Functions_with_Almost_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Very_High_Nonlinearity","220334098_A_Conjecture_on_Binary_String_and_Its_Applications_on_Constructing_Boolean_Functions_of_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","3086045_Maiorana-McFarland_Class_Degree_Optimization_and_Algebraic_Properties","3085927_Algebraic_immunity_for_cryptographically_significant_Boolean_functions_Analysis_and_construction","3080724_Further_Constructions_of_Resilient_Boolean_Functions_with_Very_High_Nonlinearity","3077616_Weights_of_the_orthogonals_of_the_extended_quadratic_binary_Goppa_codes","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","280212584_A_class_of_1-resilient_boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","273312470_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Excellent_Cryptographic_Criteria_Using_Bivariate_Polynomial_Representation","271458226_Almost_perfect_algebraic_immune_functions_with_good_nonlinearity","265818767_Construction_of_Resilient_and_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_with_Almost_Perfect_Immunity_to_Algebraic_and_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","262771282_Enhanced_Boolean_functions_suitable_for_the_filter_model_of_pseudo-random_generator","226676049_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","225527740_Construction_and_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions_of_2t1_Variables_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","224155509_On_the_Resistance_of_Boolean_Functions_Against_Algebraic_Attacks_Using_Univariate_Polynomial_Representation","224078303_Constructions_of_Almost_Optimal_Resilient_Boolean_Functions_on_Large_Even_Number_of_Variables","221354680_Rewriting_Variables_The_Complexity_of_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","221327238_Construction_and_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions_of_2","221327136_On_the_Correlation_Immune_Functions_and_Their_Nonlinearity","220848484_A_Note_on_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Higher_Order_Nonlinearities","220685118_Construction_of_Nonlinear_Resilient_Boolean_Functions_Using_Small_Affine_Functions","220682886_More_Balanced_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Nonlinearity_and_Resistance_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","220661069_Construction_of_1-resilient_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","220639279_A_conjecture_on_binary_string_and_its_applicationson_constructing_Boolean_functions_of_optimal_algebraic_immunity","220570259_Boolean_functions_optimizing_most_of_the_cryptographic_criteria","220333689_Tight_bound_between_nonlinearity_and_algebraic_immunity","220333148_1-Resilient_Boolean_Function_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","46946127_The_Stability_Theory_of_Stream_Ciphers","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","3086335_A_New_Attack_on_the_Filter_Generator","3084391_Products_of_Linear_Recurring_Sequences_with_Maximum_Complexity","3084083_Correlation-immunity_of_nonlinear_combining_functions_for_cryptographic_applications_Corresp","3081461_Shift-Register_Synthesis_and_BCH_Decoding","3077187_A_spectral_characterization_of_Correlation-Immune_combining_functions","3048492_Decrypting_a_Class_of_Stream_Ciphers_Using_Ciphertext_Only"]}
