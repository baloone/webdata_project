{"id":"313362969_A_conceptual_framework_for_serious_games","abstract":"A considerable number of serious games have been developed over the last ten years, with varying degrees of success. Due to a lack of clear standards and guidelines for game developers, it is difficult to justify claims that a specific game meets the learnerâ€™s requirements and/or expectations. This paper defines a conceptual model for serious games that will contribute to their design and the measurement of achievement in meeting their learning outcomes.","authors":["Amri Yusoff","Richard Michael Crowder","Lester Gilbert","Gary Wills"],"meta":["July 2009","Conference: Ninth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies"],"references":[]}
