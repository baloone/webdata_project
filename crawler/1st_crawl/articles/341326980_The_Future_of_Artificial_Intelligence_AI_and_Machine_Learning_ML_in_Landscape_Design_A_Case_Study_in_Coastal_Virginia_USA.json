{"id":"341326980_The_Future_of_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_and_Machine_Learning_ML_in_Landscape_Design_A_Case_Study_in_Coastal_Virginia_USA","abstract":"There have been theory-based endeavours that directly engage with AI and ML in the landscape discipline. By presenting a case that uses machine learning techniques to predict variables in a coastal environment, this paper provides empirical evidence of the forthcoming cybernetic environment , in which designers are conceptualized not as authors but as choreographers, catalyst agents, and conductors among many other intelligent agents. Drawing ideas from posthumanism, this paper argues that, to truly understand the cybernetic environment, we have to take on posthumanist ethics and overcome human exceptionalism.","authors":["Zihao Zhang","Benjamin Bowes"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.14627/537663001","Projects: AI/ML and Landscape ArchitectureIntelligence"],"references":["329262080_Trust_me_my_neighbors_say_it's_raining_outside_ensuring_data_trustworthiness_for_crowdsourced_weather_stations","327880648_A_Third_Intelligence","327880516_Human_Factors_in_Responsive_Landscapes_Importance_and_Method","320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","327381507_Leveraging_Open_Source_Software_and_Parallel_Computing_for_Model_Predictive_Control_Simulation_of_Urban_Drainage_Systems_Using_EPA-SWMM5_and_Python","312511655_Designing_Autonomy_Opportunities_for_New_Wildness_in_the_Anthropocene","309659757_Ecology_and_Design_Parallel_Genealogies","298637931_Responsive_Landscapes_Strategies_for_Responsive_Technologies_in_Landscape_Architecture","285874063_Do_Landscapes_Learn_Ecology's_New_Paradigm_and_Design_in_Landscape_Architecture"]}
