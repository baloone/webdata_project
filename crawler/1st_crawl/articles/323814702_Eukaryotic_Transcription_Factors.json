{"id":"323814702_Eukaryotic_Transcription_Factors","abstract":"Transcription factors are proteins which bind to the DNA of their target genes, either directly or indirectly and then influence transcription either positively or negatively. These factors have a molecular structure with specific domains being responsible for the ability to both bind to DNA and increase or decrease the rate of transcription. Transcription factors themselves are regulated either by regulating their synthesis or by regulating their activity, for example, by protein-protein interaction or by phosphorylation. The rate of transcription of a specific gene in a particular situation is therefore determined by the balance between positively and negatively acting factors which can bind to its regulatory regions and which are present in an active form in that particular situation.","authors":["D.S.
