{"id":"6900151_The_Voice_Handicap_Index_Correlation_Between_Subjective_Patient_Response_and_Quantitative_Assessment_of_Voice","abstract":"The aim of this prospective study is to elucidate the relationship between the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and several voice laboratory measurements in the network of the multidimensional voice assessment. Fifty-eight patients were included. Each patient replies to the questionnaire and performs a voice assessment during the same time. The following parameters were measured: minimum frequency, maximum frequency, range, minimum intensity, subglottic pressure, mean flow, maximum phonation time, jitter, and dysphonia severity index. Regarding the relationship with the scores of the VHI, poor correlations with the minimal frequency for all the scores except the emotional one (total and subscales) and with the range for only the physical one are found. Seventeen questions correlate with the voice laboratory measurements we performed, with a decreased distribution between physical, functional, and emotional subscales. We observe that acoustic parameter is correlated with the emotional subscale, the parameters of the profile range are more often involved in the emotional subscale, as is the minimal frequency, but never with the physical subscale, and all the subscales are interesting despite the smaller number of differences with the emotional one. The VHI and the laboratory measurements give independent informations in practice.","authors":["Virginie Woisard","SÃ©verine Bodin","Eli Yardeni","Michele Puech"],"meta":["October 2007Journal of Voice 21(5):623-31","DOI:10.1016/j.jvoice.2006.04.005","SourcePubMed"],"references":["269884019_The_Voice_Handicap_Index","263537954_The_Voice_Handicap_Index_VHI_Development_and_Validation","225754043_A_basic_protocol_for_functional_assessment_of_voice_pathology_especially_for_investigating_the_efficacy_of_phonosurgical_treatments_and_evaluating_new_assessment_techniques_-_Guideline_elaborated_by_t","14206059_Research_Work_of_the_Belgian_Study_Group_on_Voice_Disorders_1996_Results","12442421_The_Dysphonia_Severity_Index_An_Objective_Measure_of_Vocal_Quality_Based_on_a_Multiparameter_Approach","10715574_Use_of_differential_item_functioning_to_assess_the_equivalence_of_translations_of_a_questionnaire","7880916_The_Voice_Handicap_Index_Impact_of_the_translation_in_French_on_the_validation","312187970_Functional_assessment_of_voice_disorders_Report_of_the_Royal_Belgian_Society_for_Ear_Nose_Throat_Head_and_Neck_Surgery","229078388_Clinical_measurement_of_speech_and_voice","21669470_A_multiparameter_method_of_computer-assisted_objective_vocal_evaluation","14381347_Objective_Evaluation_of_Dysphonia_Preliminary_Results_of_a_Device_Allowing_Simultaneous_Acoustic_and_Aerodynamic_Measurements","11412141_Correlation_between_voice_handicap_index_and_voice_laboratory_measurements_in_dysphonic_patients","11069767_Comparison_of_the_responsiveness_of_the_Barthel_Index_and_the_Motor_Component_of_the_Functional_Independence_Measure_in_stroke","10691041_Measurement_and_validation_of_the_voice_handicap_index_in_voice-disordered_patients_in_Taiwan","9018742_Validation_of_the_German_version_of_the_Voice_Handicap_Index","8926876_Health_status_and_voice_outcome_after_treatment_for_T1a_glottic_carcinoma","8631943_An_investigation_of_the_Voice_Handicap_Index_with_Speakers_of_Portuguese_Preliminary_data","8399009_Complex_voice_assessment--Polish_version_of_the_Voice_Handicap_Index_VHI","8260243_Factors_Predicting_Patient_Perception_of_Dysphonia_Caused_by_Benign_Vocal_Fold_Lesions","7835044_Psychometric_Evaluation_of_Disease_Specific_Quality_of_Life_Instruments_in_Voice_Disorders","7635163_The_Relationship_Between_VHI_Scores_and_Specific_Acoustic_Measures_of_Mildly_Disordered_Voice_Production"]}
