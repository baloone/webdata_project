{"id":"308716714_Squared_Chromatic_Number_Without_Claws_or_Large_Cliques","abstract":"Let G be a claw-free graph on n vertices with clique number ω, and consider the chromatic number χ(G ² ) of the square G ² of G. Writing χ′ s (d) for the supremum of χ(L ² ) over the line graphs L of simple graphs of maximum degree at most d, we prove that χ(G ² ) ≤ χ′ s (ω) for ω ∈ {3, 4}. For ω = 3, this implies the sharp bound χ(G ² ) ≤ 10. For ω = 4, this implies χ(G ² ) ≤ 22, which is within 2 of the conjectured best bound. This work is motivated by a strengthened form of a conjecture of Erdos and Nešetřil.","authors":["Wouter Cames van Batenburg","Ross J Kang"],"meta":["October 2016Canadian mathematical bulletin = Bulletin canadien de mathématiques 62(1)","DOI:10.4153/CMB-2018-024-5","Project: Distance coloring"],"references":["319446853_Colouring_Squares_of_Claw-free_Graphs","318896824_Colouring_squares_of_claw-free_graphs","313002179_The_structure_of_claw-free_graphs","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","268301926_A_Structure_Theorem_for_Claw-Free_Perfect_Graphs","266993662_Claw-free_graphs_VI_Colouring","264349319_Induced_Matchings_in_Graphs_of_Degree_at_Most_4","259106337_Induced_Matchings_in_Subcubic_Graphs","256935755_A_Bound_on_the_Strong_Chromatic_Index_of_a_Graph","229706634_Induced_matchings_in_cubic_graphs"]}
