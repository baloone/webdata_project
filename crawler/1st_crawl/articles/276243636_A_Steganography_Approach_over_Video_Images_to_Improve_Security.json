{"id":"276243636_A_Steganography_Approach_over_Video_Images_to_Improve_Security","abstract":"Nowadays the growth of information technologies makes it convenient for people to transmit mass data like confidential biomedical records, banking or financial data through Internet. However, it also provides vast opportunities for hackers to filch valuable information. Therefore, security becomes an important issue. Steganography is a recently developed technique in the data security field and has received significant attention from both industry and academia. Digital data hiding methods can hide message in multimedia files for secret communications. This paper presents a secure data hiding technique for video images using random key encoding function. Secret data are embedded into the random Red Green Blue (RGB) pixel values of the cover-video images using an encryption key. The cover-video images are pre-processed to prevent overflow/underflow. Experimental results indicate that the extracted data are without any errors. The performance of the proposed scheme is proved in terms of security and (Peak signal noise ratio) PSNR values.","authors":["Mritha Ramalingam","Nor Ashidi Mat Isa"],"meta":["January 2015Indian Journal of Science and Technology 8(1)","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2015/v8i1/53100"],"references":["288146160_Digital_Image_Steganography_using_Nine-Pixel_Differencing_and_Modified_LSB_Substitution","277422914_Cyber_warfare","261458589_Secure_key_based_image_realization_steganography","238520852_A_view_on_latest_audio_steganography_techniques","235438740_Text_Steganographic_Approaches_A_Comparison","221566343_Analysis_of_Current_Steganography_Tools_Classifications_Features","221523569_Image_Steganography_and_Steganalysis_Concepts_and_Practice","220427158_Cyber_warfare_steganography_vs_steganalysis","36409227_Steganography_and_Steganalysis_in_Digital_Multimedia_Hype_or_Hallelujah","4309154_Lossless_Steganography_on_AVI_File_Using_Swapping_Algorithm","2378701_On_The_Limits_of_Steganography","266605056_High_Capacity_Data_Hiding_Scheme_for_DCT-based_Images","261108969_ECR_encryption_with_cover_text_and_reordering_based_text_steganography","230681768_Who_decides_hiding_capacity_I_the_pixel_intensity","222828997_Digital_image_steganography_Survey_and_analysis_of_current_methods_Signal_Processing","220614718_A_new_steganography_algorithm_based_on_color_histograms_for_data_embedding_into_raw_video_streams","49591260_Hiding_Data_in_Video_File_An_Overview","3404638_Scope_of_validity_of_PSNR_in_imagevideo_quality_assessment","3359120_High_capacity_image_steganography_model"]}
