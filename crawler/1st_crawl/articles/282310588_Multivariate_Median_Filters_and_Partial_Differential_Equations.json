{"id":"282310588_Multivariate_Median_Filters_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","abstract":"Multivariate median filters have been proposed as generalisations of the\nwell-established median filter for grey-value images to multi-channel images.\nAs multivariate median, most of the recent approaches use the $L^1$ median,\ni.e.\\ the minimiser of an objective function that is the sum of distances to\nall input points. Many properties of univariate median filters generalise to\nsuch a filter. However, the famous result by Guichard and Morel about\napproximation of the mean curvature motion PDE by median filtering does not\nhave a comparably simple counterpart for $L^1$ multivariate median filtering.\nWe discuss the affine equivariant Oja median and the affine equivariant\ntransformation--retransformation $L^1$ median as alternatives to $L^1$ median\nfiltering. We analyse multivariate median filters in a space-continuous\nsetting, including the formulation of a space-continuous version of the\ntransformation--retransformation $L^1$ median, and derive PDEs approximated by\nthese filters in the cases of bivariate planar images, three-channel volume\nimages and three-channel planar images. The PDEs for the affine equivariant\nfilters can be interpreted geometrically as combinations of a diffusion and a\nprincipal-component-wise curvature motion contribution with a cross-effect term\nbased on torsions of principal components. Numerical experiments are presented\nthat demonstrate the validity of the approximation results.","authors":["Martin Welk"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 56(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0645-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273267910_Adaptive_Filters_for_Color_Images_Median_Filtering_and_Its_Extensions","254418862_On_a_transformation_and_re-transformation_technique_for_constructing_affine_equivariant_multivariate_median","285104802_What_is_the_center_of_an_area_or_the_center_of_a_population","285058550_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","281654336_Morphological_Amoebas_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","272928815_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","268907984_Di_talune_estensioni_dei_concetti_di_media_ai_caratteri_qualitativi","262162813_Geometric_partial_differential_equations_and_iterative_filtering","261822993_The_Fermat-Torricelli_Points_of_n_Lines","247114362_Partial_differential_equations_and_image_iterative_ltering","246813681_Methodology_based_on_L1-norm_in_statistical_inference","243787319_An_Approximation_to_the_Point_of_Minimum_Aggregate_Distance","243781258_A_Survey_of_Multidimensional_Medians","243655500_Image_selective_smoothing_and_edge_detection_by_nonlinear_di_usion","242527894_Sur_Le_Point_Pour_Lequel_la_Somme_Des_Distances_de_n_Points_Donnes_est_Minimum"]}
