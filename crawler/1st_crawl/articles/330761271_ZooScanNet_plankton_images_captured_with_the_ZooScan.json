{"id":"330761271_ZooScanNet_plankton_images_captured_with_the_ZooScan","abstract":"Plankton was sampled with various nets, from bottom or 500m depth to the surface, in many oceans of the world. Samples were imaged with a ZooScan. The full images were processed with ZooProcess which generated regions of interest (ROIs) around each individual object and a set of associated features measured on the object (see Gorsky et al 2010 for more information). The same objects were re-processed to compute features with the scikit-image toolbox (http://scikit-image.org). The 1,433,278 resulting objects were sorted by a limited number of operators, following a common taxonomic guide, into 93 taxa, using the web application EcoTaxa (http://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr).","authors":["Amanda Elineau","corinne desnos","laetitia jalabert","marion olivier"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.17882/55741"],"references":[]}
