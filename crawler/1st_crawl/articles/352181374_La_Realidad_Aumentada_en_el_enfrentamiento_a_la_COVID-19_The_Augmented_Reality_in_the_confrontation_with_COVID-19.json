Computer science as its derived branches has allowed professionals in this sector to have certain innovation tools such as Augmented Reality to perform their skills quickly and effectively. This technology represents a recent form of visualization that combines, in a functional way, virtuality with reality itself, creating new possibilities for the interpretation of previously unavailable information, which open new ways to learn and recognize data, process it into information and convert it\neasily in knowledge. The different ways to carry out experiences in augmented reality are listed from different\ncomputer and telecommunication platforms, which facilitate the advancement of projects in this regard, quickly and economically. Medicine, and particularly in the detection and control of viruses, can use this type of means to provide a true diagnosis of each infected patient, in order to prevent its spread. This article aims to analyze the use of augmented reality in the confrontation with COVID-19, in order to know the advantages and benefits that it represents, for its incorporation in medical research.","authors":["Lenna Carballo Muñoz","Yanai Fernández"],"meta":["November 2020"],"references":[]}
