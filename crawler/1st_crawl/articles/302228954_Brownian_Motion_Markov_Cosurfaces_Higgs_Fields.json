{"id":"302228954_Brownian_Motion_Markov_Cosurfaces_Higgs_Fields","abstract":"Brownian motion enters quantum theory in many ways, e.g. in the stochastic mechanical formulation of quantum theory, see e.g. ([1],[2],°) in the formulation of quantum field theory as Euclidean field theory, with covariances given by potential operators belonging to Brownian motions ([29], [3],[4]), in the expression of certain field theoretical models as “gases of local times of Brownian motion” ([5] – [7],[26],[33],[36]). In this lecture we shall discuss yet other uses of Brownian motion, and related processes, in the description of the quantum world, more precisely in connection with random group-valued hypersurfaces and gauge fields, leading to a (noncommutative) stochastic analysis with “higher dimensional time”. Let us start with gauge fields. Formally a pure Yang-Mills Euclidean measure gives a “white noise” type of distribution to the curvature 2-form F. Finding the corresponding connection a s.t. F = Da (D covariant derivative) implies then solving a stochastic partial differential equation for Lie algebra-valued one forms. The holonomyoperator is a stochastic one. This is one motivation for developing a suitable theory of stochastic mapping from curves into Lie groups, and extending the study of multiplicative stochastic differential equations to the case of multiplicative stochastic partial differential equations.","authors":["Sergio Angelo Albeverio","Raphael Høegh-Krohn"],"meta":["January 1986","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4684-5221-1_10","In book: Fundamental Aspects of Quantum Theory (pp.95-104)"],"references":["302325043_Stochastic_Description_of_Supersymmetric_Fields_with_Values_in_A_Manifold","279343517_Probability_Measures_on_Locally_Compact_Groups","279334757_PROBABILITY_MEASURES_IN_A_METRIC_SPACE","268709631_Diffusion_fields_quantum_fields_and_fields_with_values_in_Lie_groups","268500906_Non-Standard_Analysis_Polymer_Models_Quantum_Fields","267052202_Brownian_Motion","266685536_Markov_Processes_on_Infinite_Dimensional_Spaces_Markov_Fields_and_Markov_Cosurfaces","259944561_Higgs2_3_quantum_fields_in_a_finite_volume_III_Renormalization","252599833_The_Relation_Between_Quantum_Mechanics_And_Classical_Mechanics_A_Survey_Of_Some_Mathematical_Aspects","250664106_Variations_of_random_processes_with_independent_increments","247261131_Probability_Measures_on_Locally_Compact_Groups","243311420_Markov_processes_random_fields_and_Dirichlet_spaces","243022854_A_Poincar_lemma_for_connection_forms","238860820_Multiple_path_integrals","235410249_Quantum_Fluctuations","229137248_The_use_of_random_walk_in_field_theory","226754068_TheU1_Higgs_model","226140149_On_the_Markov_property_of_a_class_of_linear_infinitely_divisible_fields","222381821_Perturbation_of_the_Laplacian_supported_by_null_sets_with_applications_to_polymer_measures_and_quantum_fields","44485786_Stetige_Faltungshalbgruppen_von_Wahrscheinlichkeitsmassen_und_erzeugende_Distributionen_Wilfried_Hazod","33700518_Gauge_Theories_as_a_Problem_of_Constructive_Qantum_Field_Theory_and_Statistical_Mechanics","27293774_Stetige_Faltungshalbgruppen_von_Wahrscheinlichkeitsmaben_und_erzeugende_Distributionen"]}
