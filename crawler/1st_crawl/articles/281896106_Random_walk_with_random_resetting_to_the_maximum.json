{"id":"281896106_Random_walk_with_random_resetting_to_the_maximum","abstract":"We study analytically a simple random walk model on a one-dimensional\nlattice, where at each time step the walker resets to the maximum of the\nalready visited positions (to the rightmost visited site) with a probability\n$r$, and with probability $(1-r)$, it undergoes symmetric random walk, i.e., it\nhops to one of its neighboring sites, with equal probability $(1-r)/2$. For\n$r=0$, it reduces to a standard random walk whose typical distance grows as\n$\\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$. In presence of a nonzero resetting rate $0<r\\le 1$,\nwe find that both the average maximum and the average position grow\nballistically for large $n$, with a common speed $v(r)$. Moreover, the\nfluctuations around their respective averages grow diffusively, again with the\nsame diffusion coefficient $D(r)$. We compute $v(r)$ and $D(r)$ explicitly. We\nalso show that the probability distribution of the difference between the\nmaximum and the location of the walker, becomes stationary as $n\\to \\infty$.\nHowever, the approach to this stationary distribution is accompanied by a\ndynamical phase transition, characterized by a weakly singular large deviation\nfunction. We also show that $r=0$ is a special `critical' point, for which the\ngrowth laws are different from the $r\\to 0$ case and we calculate the exact\ncrossover functions that interpolate between the critical $(r=0)$ and the\noff-critical $(r\\to 0)$ behavior for finite but large $n$.","authors":["Satya N.
