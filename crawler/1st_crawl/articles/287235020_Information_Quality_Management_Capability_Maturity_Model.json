{"id":"287235020_Information_Quality_Management_Capability_Maturity_Model","abstract":"Today, it is essential for organisations to pay greater attention to data and information, which must be considered as a valuable strategic resource. However, many organisations are challenged by determining the right way to improve the level of data quality. Saša Baškarada presents a capability maturity model for information quality management process assessment and improvement. The author employed six exploratory case studies and a four round Delphi study to gain a better understanding of the research problem and to build the preliminary model, which he then applied in seven international case studies for further enhancement and external validation. The model is a set of evaluation tools and methodologies, which are intended to assist with the identification of relevant problems and solutions. Thus, the Information Quality Management Capability Maturity Model (IQM-CMM) may provide organisations with a measure of their maturity in information quality management, along with recommendations for increasing the level of maturity. © Vieweg+Teubner | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, Wiesbaden 2009.
