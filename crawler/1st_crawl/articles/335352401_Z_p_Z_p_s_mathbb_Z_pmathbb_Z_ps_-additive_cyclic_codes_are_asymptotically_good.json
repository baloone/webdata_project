The generator matrix of this class of codes is obtained. By establishing the relationship between the random \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{p}\\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}}\\)-additive cyclic code and random quasi-cyclic code of index 2 over \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{p}\\), the asymptotic properties of the rates and relative distances of this class of codes are studied. As a consequence, we prove that \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{p}\\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}}\\)-additive cyclic codes are asymptotically good since the asymptotic GV-bound at \\(\\frac {1+p^{s-1}}{2}\\delta \\) is greater than \\(\\frac {1}{2}\\), the relative distance of the code is convergent to Î´, while the rate is convergent to \\(\\frac {1}{1+p^{s-1}}\\) for \\(0< \\delta < \\frac {1}{1+p^{s-1}}\\).","authors":["Ting Yao","Shixin Zhu"],"meta":["August 2019Cryptography and Communications 12(3)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-019-00397-z"],"references":["329332239_On_ZpZpk-additive_codes_and_their_duality","326860837_Asymptotically_Good_Additive_Cyclic_Codes_Exist","322652442_Double_circulant_self-dual_and_LCD_codes_over_Galois_rings","320014258_On_self-dual_negacirculant_codes_of_index_two_and_four","308603176_24-additive_cyclic_codes","296699328_Double_Circulant_Matrices","278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","334142374_Double_circulant_LCD_codes_over_Z_4","319960558_Asymptotically_good_quasi-cyclic_codes_of_fractional_index","290263491_Good_Self-dual_Generalized_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_Exist"]}
