{"id":"292449684_Automatic_Methods_of_Inductive_Inference","abstract":"This thesis is concerned with algorithms for generating\ngeneralisations-from experience. These algorithms are viewed as\nexamples of the general concept of a hypothesis discovery system\nwhich, in its turn, is placed in a framework in which it is seen as\none component in a multi-stage process which includes stages of\nhypothesis criticism or justification, data gathering and analysis\nand prediction. Formal and informal criteria, which should be\nsatisfied by the discovered hypotheses are given. In particular,\nthey should explain experience and be simple. The formal work uses\nthe first-order predicate calculus.\nThese criteria are applied to the case of hypotheses which are\ngeneralisations from experience. A formal definition of generalisation\nfrom experience, relative to a body of knowledge is developed and\nseveral syntactical simplicity measures are defined. This work uses\nmany concepts taken from resolution theory (Robinson, 1965). We\ndevelop a set of formal criteria that must be satisfied by any hypothesis\ngenerated by an algorithm for producing generalisation from experience.\nThe mathematics of generalisation is developed. In particular,\nin the case when there is no body of knowledge, it is shown that there is\nalways a least general generalisation of any two clauses, in the\ngeneralisation ordering. (In resolution theory, a clause is an\nabbreviation for a disjunction of literals.) This least general\ngeneralisation is effectively obtainable. Some lattices induced by the generalisation ordering, in the case\nwhere there is no body of knowledge, are investigated.\nThe formal set of criteria is investigated. It is shown that for\na certain simplicity measure, and under the assumption that there is no\nbody of knowledge, there always exist hypotheses which satisfy them.\nGenerally, however, there is no algorithm which, given the sentences\ndescribing experience, will produce as output a hypothesis satisfying\nthe formal criteria. These results persist for a wide range of other\nsimplicity measures. However several useful cases for which algorithms\nare available are described, as are some general properties of the set of\nhypotheses which satisfy the criteria.\nSome connections with philosophy are discussed. It is shown that,\nwith sufficiently large experience, in some cases, any hypothesis which\nsatisfies the formal criteria is acceptable in the sense of Hintikka and\nHilpinen (1966). The role of simplicity is further discussed. Some\npractical difficulties which arise because of Goodman's (1965) \"grue\"\nparadox of confirmation theory are presented.\nA variant of the formal criteria suggested by the work of Meltzer\n(1970) is discussed. This allows an effective method to be developed\nwhen this was not possible before. However, the possibility is\ncountenanced that inconsistent hypotheses might be proposed by the\ndiscovery algorithm.\nThe positive results on the existence of hypotheses satisfying the formal criteria are extended to include some simple types of knowledge.\nIt is shown that they cannot be extended much further without changing\nthe underlying simplicity ordering.\nA program which implements one of the decidable cases is described.\nIt is used to find definitions in the game of noughts and crosses and in\nfamily relationships.\nAn abstract study is made of the progression of hypothesis discovery\nmethods through time.\nSome possible and some impossible behaviours of such methods are\ndemonstrated. This work is an extension of that of Gold (1967) and\nFeldman (1970). The results are applied to the case of machines that\ndiscover generalisations. They are found to be markedly sensitive to\nthe underlying simplicity ordering employed.","authors":["Gordon Plotkin"],"meta":["January 1972"],"references":["239583378_Studies_in_the_completeness_and_efficiency_of_theorem-proving_by_resolution","238701629_Search_strategies_for_theorem_proving","324311732_A_Study_of_Thinking","323742444_A_Way_to_Simplify_Truth_Functions","292115061_Studies_in_the_Logic_of_Explanation","284528353_A_Machine-Oriented_Logic_based_on_the_Resolution_Principle","284202717_Rediscovering_some_problems_of_artificial_intelligence_in_the_context_of_organic_chemistry","275870852_The_Use_of_Simplicity_in_Induction","274487581_Recent_Developments_in_the_Theory_of_Simplicity","274054225_The_Problem_of_Counterfactuals","268753624_Notes_on_the_Paradoxes_of_Confirmation","267125232_Distributive_normal_forms_in_the_calculus_of_predicates","267118582_A_logic_of_actions","267089999_Power_amplification_for_theorem-provers","267021942_Representations_and_modelling_in_problems_of_program_formation","267014276_Distributive_Normal_Forms_in_First-Order_Logic","266692484_Knowledge_Acceptance_and_Inductive_Logic","266692409_A_Two-Dimensional_Continuum_of_Inductive_Methods","266228414_The_Logical_Structure_of_the_World","266017636_An_experiment_in_automatic_induction","265896063_Rules_of_Acceptance_and_Inductive_Logic","265700974_Probability_rationality_and_a_rule_of_detachment","265457554_Transformational_systems_and_the_algebraic_structure_of_atomic_formulas","264948226_Programming_in_POP-2","249079930_Hempel_and_Oppenheim_on_Explanation","249079738_A_Definition_of_Degree_of_Confirmation_for_Very_Rich_Languages","249079698_The_Weight_of_Simplicity_in_the_Construction_and_Assaying_of_Scientific_Theories","248125963_Towards_a_Theory_of_Inductive_Generalization","244443415_Studies_in_the_logic_of_confirmation_I_II","243784884_Degree_of_Confirmation''and_Inductive_Logic","243697670_Learning_Machines_Foundations_of_Trainable_Pattern-Classifying_Systems","243528725_Recent_work_in_inductive_logic","242606398_Further_note_on_inductive_generalization","242506261_A_Note_on_Inductive_Generalization","238651290_A_formal_theory_of_inductive_inference_I","232519711_Experiments_in_Induction","232475740_The_Logical_Foundations_of_Probability","220812345_The_Modeling_of_Simple_Analogic_and_Inductive_Processes_in_a_Semantic_Memory_System","220431992_Resolution_With_Merging","220248429_A_Remark_on_Discovery_Algorithms_for_Grammars","38375927_A_Logical_Measure_Function","35846898_A_study_of_grammatical_inference","35576805_Logics_of_scientific_discovery_microform","34413920_A_completeness_theorem_and_a_computer_program_for_finding_theorems_derivable_from_given_axioms"]}
