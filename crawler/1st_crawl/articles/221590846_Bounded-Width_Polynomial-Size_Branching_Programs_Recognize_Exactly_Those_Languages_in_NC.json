{"id":"221590846_Bounded-Width_Polynomial-Size_Branching_Programs_Recognize_Exactly_Those_Languages_in_NC","abstract":"We show that any language recognized by an NC ’ circuit (fan-in 2, depth O(log n)) can be recognized by a width-5 polynomial-size branching program. As any bounded-width polynomial-size branching program can be simulated by an NC ’ circuit, we have that the class of languages recognized by such programs is exactly nonuniform NC’.
