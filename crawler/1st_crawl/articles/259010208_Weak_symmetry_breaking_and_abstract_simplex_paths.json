{"id":"259010208_Weak_symmetry_breaking_and_abstract_simplex_paths","abstract":"Motivated by questions in theoretical distributed computing, we develop the\ncombinatorial theory of abstract simplex path subdivisions. Our main\napplication is a short and structural proof of the theorem of Castaneda and\nRajsbaum. This theorem in turn implies the solvability of the weak symmetry\nbreaking task in the immediate snapshot wait-free model in the case when the\nnumber of processes is not a power of a prime number.","authors":["Dmitry N.
