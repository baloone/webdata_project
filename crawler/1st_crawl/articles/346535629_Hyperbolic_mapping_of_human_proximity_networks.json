{"id":"346535629_Hyperbolic_mapping_of_human_proximity_networks","abstract":"Human proximity networks are temporal networks representing the close-range proximity among humans in a physical space. They have been extensively studied in the past 15 years as they are critical for understanding the spreading of diseases and information among humans. Here we address the problem of mapping human proximity networks into hyperbolic spaces. Each snapshot of these networks is often very sparse, consisting of a small number of interacting (i.e., non-zero degree) nodes. Yet, we show that the time-aggregated representation of such systems over sufficiently large periods can be meaningfully embedded into the hyperbolic space, using methods developed for traditional (non-mobile) complex networks. We justify this compatibility theoretically and validate it experimentally. We produce hyperbolic maps of six different real systems, and show that the maps can be used to identify communities, facilitate efficient greedy routing on the temporal network, and predict future links with significant precision. Further, we show that epidemic arrival times are positively correlated with the hyperbolic distance from the infection sources in the maps. Thus, hyperbolic embedding could also provide a new perspective for understanding and predicting the behavior of epidemic spreading in human proximity systems.","authors":["Marco Antonio Rodriguez Flores","Fragkiskos Papadopoulos"],"meta":["November 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-77277-7"],"references":["340977530_weg2vec_Event_embedding_for_temporal_networks","337552431_Latent_geometry_and_dynamics_of_proximity_networks","337266763_Mercator_uncovering_faithful_hyperbolic_embeddings_of_complex_networks","329769034_Similarity_Forces_and_Recurrent_Components_in_Human_Face-to-Face_Interaction_Networks","324473034_The_latent_geometry_of_the_human_protein_interaction_network","323118933_Updating_Dynamic_Random_Hyperbolic_Graphs_in_Sublinear_Time","322592281_Navigable_maps_of_structural_brain_networks_across_species","321954542_NDlib_a_Python_Library_to_Model_and_Analyze_Diffusion_Processes_Over_Complex_Networks","336905808_A_Map_of_Approaches_to_Temporal_Networks","323715289_Efficient_Embedding_of_Scale-Free_Graphs_in_the_Hyperbolic_Plane","321902156_Can_co-location_be_used_as_a_proxy_for_face-to-face_contacts","321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","319622483_Navigability_of_temporal_networks_in_hyperbolic_space","321347841_A_Review_of_Dynamic_Network_Models_with_Latent_Variables","321306827_A_Survey_on_Network_Embedding"]}
