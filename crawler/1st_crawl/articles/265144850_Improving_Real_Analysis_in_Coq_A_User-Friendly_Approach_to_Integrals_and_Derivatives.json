{"id":"265144850_Improving_Real_Analysis_in_Coq_A_User-Friendly_Approach_to_Integrals_and_Derivatives","abstract":"Verification of numerical analysis programs requires dealing with derivatives and integrals. High confidence in this process can be achieved using a formal proof checker, such as Coq. Its standard library provides an axiomatization of real numbers and various lemmas about real analysis, which may be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, its definitions of derivative and integral are unpractical as they are partial functions that demand a proof term. This proof term makes the han-dling of mathematical formulas cumbersome and does not conform to traditional analysis. Other proof assistants usually do not suffer from this issue; for instance, they may rely on Hilbert's epsilon to get total operators. In this paper, we propose a way to define total operators for derivative and integral without having to extend Coq's standard axiom-atization of real numbers. We proved the compatibility of our definitions with the standard library's in order to leverage existing results. We also greatly improved automation for real analysis proofs that use Coq stan-dard definitions. We exercised our approach on lemmas involving iterated partial derivatives and differentiation under the integral sign, that were missing from the formal proof of a numerical program solving the wave equation.","authors":["Sylvie Boldo","Catherine Lelay","Guillaume Melquiond"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35308-6_22","Conference: International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs"],"references":["221234920_Three_Chapters_of_Measure_Theory_in_IsabelleHOL","220915816_C-CoRN_the_Constructive_Coq_Repository_at_Nijmegen","48202776_Type_Classes_for_Mathematics_in_Type_Theory","26606216_Formalization_of_the_Integral_Calculus_in_the_PVS_Theorem_Prover","2484242_The_Definition_of_the_Riemann_Definite_Integral_and_some_Related_Lemmas","297901108_On_the_mechanization_of_real_analysis_in_IsabelleHOL","281328335_Differentiabilite_et_integrabilite_en_Coq_Application_a_la_formule_de_d'Alembert","261843726_Continuity_and_Differentiability","254855577_Constructive_real_analysis_a_type-theoretical_formalization_and_applications","242358708_Real_Function_Differentiability_1","225176022_A_HOL_theory_of_Euclidean_space","220898298_Floats_and_Ropes_A_Case_Study_for_Formal_Numerical_Program_Verification","220694030_Theorem_Proving_with_the_Real_Numbers","220532005_Nonstandard_analysis_in_ACL2","51962965_Wave_Equation_Numerical_Resolution_A_Comprehensive_Mechanized_Proof_of_a_C_Program","51950906_Formal_Proof_of_a_Wave_Equation_Resolution_Scheme_The_Method_Error","2414884_On_the_Mechanization_of_Real_Analysis_in_IsabelleHOL","1773958_Computing_with_Classical_Real_Numbers"]}
