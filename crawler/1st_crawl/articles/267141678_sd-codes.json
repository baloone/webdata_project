{"id":"267141678_sd-codes","abstract":"In this paper we introduce the notion of cyclic (f (t), σ, δ)-codes for f (t) ∈ A[t; σ, δ]. These codes generalize the θ-codes as introduced by D. Boucher, F. Ulmer, W. Geiselmann [2]. We construct generic and control matrices for these codes. As a particular case the (σ, δ)-W-code associated to a Wedderburn polynomial are defined and we show that their control matrices are given by generalized Van-dermonde matrices. All the Wedderburn polynomials of F q [t; θ] are described and their control matrices are presented. A key role will be played by the pseudo-linear transformations.","authors":["Boulagouaz M Hammed","André Leroy"],"meta":["January 2013Advances in Mathematics of Communications 7(4)","DOI:10.3934/amc.2013.7.463"],"references":["268068052_Codes_over_rings_Proceedings_of_the_CIMPA_summer_school_Ankara_Turkey_August_18-29_2008","265024268_Skew_Constacyclic_Codes_over_Galois_Rings","260707573_MDS_Convolutional_Codes_Over_a_Finite_Ring","257554963_Linear_codes_using_skew_polynomials_with_automorphisms_and_derivations","233944833_Noncommutative_Symmetric_functions_and_W_-polynomials","230609710_Noncommutative_polynomial_maps","257481710_Binary_quasi-cyclic_codes_of_index_2_and_skew_polynomial_rings","256796007_Convolutional_codes_with_additional_algebraic_structure","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","228343378_Code_equivalence_characterizes_finite_Frobenius_rings"]}
