{"id":"325559068_A_simple_and_visually_orientated_approach_for_type_synthesis_of_overconstrained_1T2R_parallel_mechanisms","abstract":"This paper presents a simple and highly visual approach for the type synthesis of a family of overconstrained parallel mechanisms that have one translational and two rotational movement capabilities. It considers, especially, mechanisms offering the accuracy and dynamic response needed for machining applications. This family features a spatial limb plus a member of a class of planar symmetrical linkages, the latter connected by a revolute joint either to the machine frame at its base link or to the platform at its output link. Criteria for selecting suitable structures from among numerous candidates are proposed by considering the realistic practical requirements for reconfigurability, movement capability, rational component design and so on. It concludes that a few can simultaneously fulfil the proposed criteria, even though a variety of structures have been presented in the literature. Exploitation of the proposed structures and evaluation criteria then leads to a novel five degrees of freedom hybrid module named TriMule. A significant potential advantage of the TriMule over the Tricept arises because all the joints connecting the base link and the machine frame can be integrated into one single, compact part, leading to a lightweight, cost effective and flexible design particularly suitable for configuring various robotized manufacturing cells.","authors":["Tian Huang","Chenglin Dong","Haitao Liu","Tao Sun"],"meta":["June 2018Robotica 37(7):1-13","DOI:10.1017/S0263574718000395","Project: Hybrid robot---TriMule"],"references":["315894511_Designing_a_Monolithic_Tip-Tilt-Piston_Flexure_Manipulator","312891553_Determinate_Synthesis_of_Symmetrical_Monolithic_Tip-Tilt-Piston_Flexure_Stages","309465017_A_structure_design_method_for_compliant_parallel_manipulators_with_actuation_isolation","273394711_Type_synthesis_of_3-DOF_RPR-equivalent_parallel_mechanisms","272428746_A_Constraint_and_Position_Identification_CPI_Approach_for_the_Synthesis_of_Decoupled_Spatial_Translational_Compliant_Parallel_Manipulators","258390660_Type_Synthesis_and_Typical_Application_of_1T2R-Type_Parallel_Robotic_Mechanisms","258140802_Structure_Synthesis_of_a_Class_of_4-DoF_and_5-DoF_Parallel_Manipulators_with_Identical_Limb_Structures","242923829_Type_Synthesis_of_Symmetrical_Lower-Mobility_Parallel_Mechanisms_Using_the_Constraint-Synthesis_Method","224135520_1T2R_Parallel_Mechanisms_Without_Parasitic_Motion","220121888_General_Methodology_for_Type_Synthesis_of_Symmetrical_Lower-Mobility_Parallel_Manipulators_and_Several_Novel_Manipulators","3299449_Type_Synthesis_of_3R2T_5-DOF_Parallel_Mechanisms_Using_the_Lie_Group_of_Displacements","3299421_Structure_Synthesis_of_a_Class_of_3-DOF_Rotational_Parallel_Manipulators","318234466_An_Approach_for_Type_Synthesis_of_Overconstrained_1T2R_Parallel_Mechanisms","297429633_Synthesis_of_multi-degree_of_freedom_parallel_flexure_system_concepts_via_Freedom_and_Constraint_Topology_FACT_-_Part_I_Principles","296669251_The_Key_to_Aerospace_Automation","282509109_An_Approach_to_Determining_the_Unknown_TwistWrench_Subspaces_of_Lower_Mobility_Serial_Kinematic_Chains","259085305_Machine_tools_for_large_parts","245366696_Position_and_Orientation_Characteristic_Equation_for_Topological_Design_of_Robot_Mechanisms","245366516_Mobility_of_Overconstrained_Parallel_Mechanisms","245366348_Theory_for_Topology_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Manipulators_and_Its_Application_to_Three-Dimension-Translation_Parallel_Manipulators","239376094_Parallel_Kinematic_Machine_Tools_-_Current_State_and_Future_Potentials","238171993_Synthesis_of_multi-degree_of_freedom_parallel_flexure_system_concepts_via_freedom_and_constraint_topology_FACT_Part_II_Practice","231830026_Type_synthesis_of_3-DOF_reducible_translational_mechanisms","227020553_Type_synthesis_of_three-DOF_UP-equivalent_parallel_manipulators_using_a_virtual-chain_approach","223919428_The_Lie_group_of_rigid_body_displacements_a_fundamental_tool_for_mechanism_design","223680950_Structural_synthesis_of_fully-isotropic_parallel_robots_with_Schonflies_motions_via_theory_of_linear_transformations_and_evolutionary_morphology","3450451_A_Geometric_Theory_for_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Sub-6_DoF_Parallel_Manipulators","3299446_Type_Synthesis_of_3T1R_4-DOF_Parallel_Manipulators_Based_on_Screw_Theory"]}
