{"id":"277145039_Dynamics_of_Lattice_Triangulations_on_Thin_Rectangles","abstract":"We consider random lattice triangulations of $n\\times k$ rectangular regions\nwith weight $\\lambda^{|\\sigma|}$ where $\\lambda>0$ is a parameter and\n$|\\sigma|$ denotes the total edge length of the triangulation. When\n$\\lambda\\in(0,1)$ and $k$ is fixed, we prove a tight upper bound of order $n^2$\nfor the mixing time of the edge-flip Glauber dynamics. Combined with the\npreviously known lower bound of order $\\exp(\\Omega(n^2))$ for $\\lambda>1$ [3],\nthis establishes the existence of a dynamical phase transition for thin\nrectangles with critical point at $\\lambda=1$.","authors":["Pietro Caputo","Fabio Martinelli","Alistair Sinclair","Alexandre Stauffer"],"meta":["May 2015ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY 21(none)","DOI:10.1214/16-EJP4321","SourcearXiv"],"references":["275669734_A_Lyapunov_function_for_Glauber_dynamics_on_lattice_triangulations","233281516_Random_Lattice_Triangulations_Structure_and_Algorithms","225081376_Dynamics_of_21_dimensional_SOS_surfaces_above_a_wall_slow_mixinginduced_by_entropic_repulsion","220780388_Sampling_Biased_Lattice_Configurations_using_Exponential_Metrics","2104597_Counting_Lattice_Triangulations","1765370_On_the_Approach_to_Equilibrium_for_a_Polymer_with_Adsorption_and_Repulsion","247384599_Relaxation_Times_of_Markov_Chains_in_Statistical_Mechanics_and_Combinatorial_Structures","244433906_Lectures_on_Glauber_Dynamics_for_Discrete_Spin_Models","2452624_Improved_Bounds_for_Mixing_Rates_of_Markov_Chains_and_Multicommodity_Flow","2104937_An_Upper_Bound_for_the_Number_of_Planar_Lattice_Triangulations"]}
