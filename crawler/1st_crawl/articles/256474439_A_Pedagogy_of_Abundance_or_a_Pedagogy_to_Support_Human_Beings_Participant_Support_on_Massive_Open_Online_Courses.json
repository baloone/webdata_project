{"id":"256474439_A_Pedagogy_of_Abundance_or_a_Pedagogy_to_Support_Human_Beings_Participant_Support_on_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","abstract":"p>This paper examines how emergent technologies could influence the design of learning environments. It will pay particular attention to the roles of educators and learners in creating networked learning experiences on massive open online courses (MOOCs). The research shows that it is possible to move from a pedagogy of abundance to a pedagogy that supports human beings in their learning through the active creation of resources and learning places by both learners and course facilitators. This pedagogy is based on the building of connections, collaborations, and the exchange of resources between people, the building of a community of learners, and the harnessing of information flows on networks. This resonates with the notion of emergent learning as learning in which actors and system co-evolve within a MOOC and where the level of presence of actors on the MOOC influences learning outcomes. \n\n</p","authors":["Rita Kop","Helene Fournier"],"meta":["November 2011International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning 12(7):74-93","DOI:10.19173/irrodl.v12i7.1041"],"references":["264873960_A_pedagogy_of_abundance","235886638_Blogs_and_Forums_as_Communication_and_Learning_Tools_in_a_MOOC","220956639_The_value_of_learning_analytics_to_networked_learning_on_a_personal_learning_environment","220040553_Promoting_and_Assessing_Value_Creation_in_Communities_and_Networks_A_Conceptual_Framework","321904255_Learning_to_Teach_in_the_21st_Century","284614115_Network_Promises_and_Their_Implications","272177686_Learning_and_Knowing_in_Networks_Changing_Roles_for_Educators_and_Designers","255563439_Streams_of_Content_Limited_Attention_The_Flow_of_Information_through_Social_Media","246672220_Learning_to_work_and_working_to_learn","239982711_Experience_as_the_Source_of_Learning_and_Development"]}
