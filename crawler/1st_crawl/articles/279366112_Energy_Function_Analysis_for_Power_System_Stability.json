{"id":"279366112_Energy_Function_Analysis_for_Power_System_Stability","abstract":"The bulk of literature in stability analysis of power systems using the direct method employs the so-called classical model for the generator. The advantage of this model is that the mechanical rotor angle deviation with respect to the synchronous reference is directly related to the electrical equivalent circuit known as the voltage behind the transient reactance model. To be precise, the phase angle of this voltage is the rotor angle deviation with respect to the synchronous frame of reference. For decades, power engineers have found this model to be adequate to predict the stability/instabilitv of the system over a time interval of 0–1 sec, also known as the “first-swing” stability. Analytically this model, in a multi-machine framework, is easier to handle. In this chapter we first develop energy functions using this model for multi-machine systems using the internal node representation. This is possible only if we treat the loads as constant impedances. Next, using the classical model and preserving the structure of the network we develop the system energy function in which it is possible to include non-linear loads.","authors":["Anantha Pai"],"meta":["January 1989","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4613-1635-0_2","In book: Energy Function Analysis for Power System Stability (pp.21-48)"],"references":[]}
