{"id":"325744081_In-memory_computing_with_resistive_switching_devices","abstract":"Modern computers are based on the von Neumann architecture in which computation and storage are physically separated: data are fetched from the memory unit, shuttled to the processing unit (where computation takes place) and then shuttled back to the memory unit to be stored. The rate at which data can be transferred between the processing unit and the memory unit represents a fundamental limitation of modern computers, known as the memory wall. In-memory computing is an approach that attempts to address this issue by designing systems that compute within the memory, thus eliminating the energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement that plagues current designs. Here we review the development of in-memory computing using resistive switching devices, where the two-terminal structure of the devices, their resistive switching properties, and direct data processing in the memory can enable area- and energy-efficient computation. We examine the different digital, analogue, and stochastic computing schemes that have been proposed, and explore the microscopic physical mechanisms involved. Finally, we discuss the challenges in-memory computing faces, including the required scaling characteristics, in delivering next-generation computing. This Review Article examines the development of in-memory computing using resistive switching devices.","authors":["D. Ielmini","H.-S.
