{"id":"259983448_Powers_of_Tensors_and_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","abstract":"This paper presents a method to analyze the powers of a given trilinear form\n(a special kind of algebraic constructions also called a tensor) and obtain\nupper bounds on the asymptotic complexity of matrix multiplication. Compared\nwith existing approaches, this method is based on convex optimization, and thus\nhas polynomial-time complexity. As an application, we use this method to study\npowers of the construction given by Coppersmith and Winograd [Journal of\nSymbolic Computation, 1990] and obtain the upper bound $\\omega<2.3728639$ on\nthe exponent of square matrix multiplication, which slightly improves the best\nknown upper bound.","authors":["Francois Le Gall"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1145/2608628.2608664","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220138268_On_Sunflowers_and_Matrix_Multiplication","37443131_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","31726084_Lectures_on_Modern_Convex_Optimization_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Engineering_Applications_A_Ben-Tal_A_Nemirovski","309535089_Fast_matrix_multiplication_using_coherent_configurations","273002355_Convex_Optimization","262289301_Multiplying_matrices_faster_than_Coppersmith-Winograd","261843561_Asymptotic_spectrum_and_matrix_multiplication","259431864_Improved_bound_for_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication","240684245_Entropy_Optimization_Interior_Point_Methods","232651473_The_asymptotic_spectrum_of_tensors_and_the_exponent_of_matrix_multiplication","230569330_Fast_matrix_multiplication_using_coherent_configurations","227150482_Gaussian_elimination_is_not_optimal","222112698_Faster_Algorithms_for_Rectangular_Matrix_Multiplication","221591803_Matrix_Multiplication_via_Arithmetic_Progressions","220618300_Partial_and_Total_Matrix_Multiplication","220162039_Matrix_Multiplication_via_Arithmetic_Progressions","4186651_Group-theoretic_Algorithms_for_Matrix_Multiplication"]}
