{"id":"283107988_Three-dimensional_FEA_of_manufacturing_process_of_small-diameter_split_sleeve_by_two-axle_bending","abstract":"Based on the two-axle bending technique, a three-dimensional FEA was developed for the manufacturing process of small-diameter split sleeve of 0Cr15Ni7Mo2Al, in order to guide the actual manufacture of the small-diameter split sleeve. The model was verified with two-axle bending experiments. Stress strain distribution, deformation of rigid axle, the relationship among rigid axle diameter, workpiece size and curvature radius were analyzed. The simulation results show that workpiece deforms more equally with the increases of feed. The force of rigid axle becomes smaller with the increase of diameter, while deformation of rigid axle becomes lager with the decrease of diameter. The curvature radius increases with the increase of rigid axle diameter. The curvature radius increases with larger width and thickness of workpiece.
