{"id":"303880756_The_Generic_Structure_of_Acknowledgments_in_Persian_Dissertations","abstract":"Acknowledgments are vital since students/researchers can\ndemonstrate their genuine appreciation through them and more importantly shape their (local/global) academic identity. In line with this significance, the present study examined the move patterns of 503 Persian dissertation acknowledgements from two major universities in Iran, from 1981 to 2014 and from sixteen various disciplines including soft and hard science disciplines. Overall, 65,323 words\nwere analyzed. By and large, a careful examination and analysis of the corpus indicated that Iranian university students follow a three tier moves pattern in writing a\ndissertation acknowledgments, namely a “Framing move” (including six micro steps), a main “Thanking move” (consisting of nine micro steps), and a “Closing move”\n(containing four micro steps). Moreover, the results indicated that the longest and shortest acknowledgments were 986 and 4 words respectively. The results also indicated that there was a significant difference in the complexity of acknowledgments in hard and soft science disciplines. The results of this study can hold valuable implications for both university students and professors who aspire an appropriate, coherent, and to the point display of scholarly competence and academic identity.","authors":["Minoo Alemi","Atefeh Rezanejad"],"meta":["February 2016"],"references":["273513340_Generic_patterns_and_socio-cultural_resources_in_acknowledgements_accompanying_Arabic_PhD_dissertations","273145974_A_genre_analysis_of_PhD_dissertation_acknowledgements_across_disciplinary_variations","272089621_Iranian_Non-native_English_Speaking_Teachers'_Rating_Criteria_Regarding_the_Speech_Act_of_Compliment_An_Investigation_of_Teachers'_Variables","270492443_Acknowledgement_patterns_in_DESIDOC_Journal_of_Library_Information_Technology","266223541_A_Contrastive_Study_of_Master_Thesis_Acknowledgements_by_Taiwanese_and_North_American_Students","257576284_Academic_Dishonesty_at_Universities_The_Case_of_Plagiarism_Among_Iranian_Language_Students","256706392_Sub-disciplinary_Variation_and_Rhetoric_in_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_Written_by_Education_Students_The_Case_of_the_University_of_Cape_Coast_Ghana","285694599_Generic_moves_in_PhD_thesis_introductions","281152732_Occluded_Genres_in_the_Academy","249738475_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_The_Anatomy_of_a_Cinderella_Genre"]}
