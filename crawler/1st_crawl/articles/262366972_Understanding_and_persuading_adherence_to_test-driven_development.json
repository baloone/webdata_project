{"id":"262366972_Understanding_and_persuading_adherence_to_test-driven_development","abstract":"In computing education, students must learn techniques practiced in relevant professions. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is one such technique popular in the software industry. Preliminary reports suggest that TDD helps produce higher-quality code. However, motivating novice programmers to adopt TDD is also recognized as a distinct challenge. My studies and proposed work address this challenge with the following objectives: measuring adherence to TDD and its consequential outcomes; understanding students' reasons for non-adherence; and influencing students' attitudes and behavior via pedagogical interventions.","authors":["Kevin Buffardi"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1145/2361276.2361308","Conference: Proceedings of the ninth annual international conference on International computing education research"],"references":["254462612_Exploring_influences_on_student_adherence_to_test-driven_development","221440311_Evaluating_the_efficacy_of_test-driven_development_Industrial_case_studies","216027190_Test-Driven_Development-By_Example","213877944_Test_Driven_Development_By_Example"]}
