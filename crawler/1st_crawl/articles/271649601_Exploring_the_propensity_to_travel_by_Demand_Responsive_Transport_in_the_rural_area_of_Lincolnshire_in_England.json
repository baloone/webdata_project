{"id":"271649601_Exploring_the_propensity_to_travel_by_Demand_Responsive_Transport_in_the_rural_area_of_Lincolnshire_in_England","abstract":"Local transport systems in rural areas worldwide are facing significant challenges. In particular, increased car ownership and usage as well as broader socio-economic trends such as ageing populations and cuts in public spending are combining to threaten the busâ€“the traditional means by which people without cars have accessed the services that they need. Consequently, Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems have emerged in a bid to combine the benefits of bus-based and taxi-based services, to deliver a relatively cheap yet comprehensive level of public transport in low demand environments. Unfortunately, while attractive in principle, several barriers conspire to limit the effectiveness of such services in practice.","authors":["Chao Wang","Mohammed Quddus","Marcus Paul Enoch","Tim Ryley"],"meta":["January 2015Case Studies on Transport Policy 38(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.cstp.2014.12.006"],"references":["258165054_Multilevel_modelling_of_Demand_Responsive_Transport_DRT_trips_in_Greater_Manchester_based_on_area-wide_socio-economic_data","257716022_Research_on_Optimization_of_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_for_Ride-sharing_Taxi","254609815_Identifying_potential_market_niches_for_Demand_Responsive_Transport","288274297_Sustainable_transport_mobility_management_and_travel_plans","284038788_Technologies_for_DRT_Systems","274815338_Transport_Systems_Policy_and_Planning_A_Geographical_Approach","266058921_Efficient_estimation_of_discrete-choice_models","259519523_A_survey_of_Demand_Responsive_Transport_in_Great_Britain","257635811_Solving_a_Dial-a-Ride_Problem_with_a_Hybrid_Multi-objective_Evolutionary_Approach_Application_to_Demand_Responsive_Transport","254609856_Barriers_to_implementing_flexible_transport_services_An_international_comparison_of_the_experiences_in_Australia_Europe_and_USA"]}
