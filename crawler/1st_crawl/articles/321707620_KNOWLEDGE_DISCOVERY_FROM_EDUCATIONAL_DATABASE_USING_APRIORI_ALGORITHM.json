{"id":"321707620_KNOWLEDGE_DISCOVERY_FROM_EDUCATIONAL_DATABASE_USING_APRIORI_ALGORITHM","abstract":"Ability to predict student's performance has become very crucial in educational environments and plays important role in producing the best quality graduates. There are several statistical tools for analyzing students' performance for knowledge discovery from available data. This study presents data mining in educational sector that identifies students' failure pattern using Apriori algorithm. The results of 20 students in 25 courses taken in their 100 and 200 level of an educational institute in North Central Nigeria were considered as a case study. The patterns discovered were used to provide recommendations to academic planners so as to improve their level of decision making, restructuring of curriculum, and modifying the prerequisites of various courses. This study revealed some interesting patterns in failed courses as some failed courses have a relationship with other failed courses. A data mining software for mining student failed courses was developed, used to mine students result, and the analysis were described.","authors":["Abdulsalam Sulaiman Olaniyi","Moshood A.
