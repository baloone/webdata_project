{"id":"30867274_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms","abstract":"A text book for a first course in design and analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on ideas and ease of understanding rather then on implementation details or programming tricks. It starts with formulating several models that include random access register machine, random access stored program machine and variants of these, so one can establish analytical results and at the same time accurately reflect on the salient features of real machines","authors":["Aho","Alfred V","Hopcroft","John E. and Ullman"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
