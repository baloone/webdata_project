{"id":"336267612_Hierarchical_Attention_Network_for_Visually-Aware_Food_Recommendation","abstract":"Food recommender systems play an important role in assisting users to identify the desired food to eat. Deciding what food to eat is a complex and multi-faceted process, which is influenced by many factors such as the ingredients, appearance of the recipe, the user's personal preference on food, and various contexts like what had been eaten in the past meals. This work formulates the food recommendation problem as predicting user preference on recipes based on three key factors that determine a user's choice on food, namely, 1) the user's (and other users') history; 2) the ingredients of a recipe; and 3) the descriptive image of a recipe. To address the challenging problem, this work develops a dedicated neural network based solution \n$Hierarchical\\ Attention\\ based\\ Food\\ Recommendation$ \n(HAFR) which is capable of: 1) capturing the collaborative filtering effect like what similar users tend to eat; 2) inferring a user's preference at the ingredient level; and 3) learning user preference from the recipe's visual images. To evaluate our proposed method, this work constructs a large-scale dataset consisting of millions of ratings from AllRecipes.com. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms several competing recommender solutions like Factorization Machine and Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking with an average improvement of 12%, offering promising results in predicting user preference for food.","authors":["Xiaooyan Gao","Fuli Feng","Xiangnan He","Heyan Huang"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE Transactions on Multimedia PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMM.2019.2945180"],"references":["334711303_KGAT_Knowledge_Graph_Attention_Network_for_Recommendation","326202692_Discrete_Factorization_Machines_for_Fast_Feature-based_Recommendation","324508009_Aesthetic-based_Clothing_Recommendation","322149254_Learning_CNN-based_Features_for_Retrieval_of_Food_Images","321095542_Grab_Pay_and_Eat_Semantic_Food_Detection_for_Smart_Restaurants","317558508_Item_Silk_Road_Recommending_Items_from_Information_Domains_to_Social_Users","315871658_What_Your_Images_Reveal_Exploiting_Visual_Contents_for_Point-of-Interest_Recommendation","314984765_How_Editorial_Temporal_and_Social_Biases_Affect_Online_Food_Popularity_and_Appreciation","311769850_Wide-Slice_Residual_Networks_for_Food_Recognition","310824733_Tell_Me_What_You_Eat_and_i_Will_Tell_You_Where_You_Come_From_A_Data_Science_Approach_for_Global_Recipe_Data_on_the_Web","309081644_Modeling_Restaurant_Context_for_Food_Recognition","305334401_Hierarchical_Attention_Networks_for_Document_Classification","302401957_Plate_and_Prejudice_Gender_Differences_in_Online_Cooking","290937236_Diet_nutrition_and_the_prevention_of_chronic_diseases","266357771_Food_Detection_and_Recognition_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","259087927_Learning_user_tastes_A_first_step_to_generating_healthy_meal_plans","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","347998729_Health-aware_Food_Recommender_System","334579433_Neural_Graph_Collaborative_Filtering","331657920_Taxonomy-Aware_Multi-Hop_Reasoning_Networks_for_Sequential_Recommendation","328374997_Deep_Understanding_of_Cooking_Procedure_for_Cross-modal_Recipe_Retrieval","327949873_Deep_reinforcement_learning_for_page-wise_recommendations","326202547_Outer_Product-based_Neural_Collaborative_Filtering","326141524_Adversarial_Personalized_Ranking_for_Recommendation","324514456_TEM_Tree-enhanced_Embedding_Model_for_Explainable_Recommendation","320541054_How_Personality_Affects_our_Likes_Towards_a_Better_Understanding_of_Actionable_Images","320540992_Cross-modal_Recipe_Retrieval_with_Rich_Food_Attributes","320250618_You_Are_What_You_Eat_Exploring_Rich_Recipe_Information_for_Cross-Region_Food_Analysis","319164072_Neural_Collaborative_Filtering","319163982_Neural_Factorization_Machines_for_Sparse_Predictive_Analytics","319163962_Fast_Matrix_Factorization_for_Online_Recommendation_with_Implicit_Feedback","318830051_Attentional_Factorization_Machines_Learning_the_Weight_of_Feature_Interactions_via_Attention_Networks","318764160_Attentive_Collaborative_Filtering_Multimedia_Recommendation_with_Item-_and_Component-Level_Attention","318502363_Yum-Me_A_Personalized_Nutrient-Based_Meal_Recommender_System","317084650_Exploiting_Food_Choice_Biases_for_Healthier_Recipe_Recommendation","312498165_Investigating_the_Healthiness_of_Internet-Sourced_Recipes_Implications_for_Meal_Planning_and_Recommender_Systems","311657299_Being_a_Super_Cook_Joint_Food_Attributes_and_Multi-Modal_Content_Modeling_for_Recipe_Retrieval_and_Exploration","311488341_Collaborative_Denoising_Auto-Encoders_for_Top-N_Recommender_Systems","310820080_Deep-based_Ingredient_Recognition_for_Cooking_Recipe_Retrieval","305381927_Retrieval_and_Classification_of_Food_Images","304407917_A_Structured_Committee_for_Food_Recognition","300358519_Food-101_-_Mining_Discriminative_Components_with_Random_Forests","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","282692454_VBPR_Visual_Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking_from_Implicit_Feedback","254004916_Factorization_Machines_with_libFM","224943864_BPR_Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking_from_Implicit_Feedback","221607751_Intelligent_food_planning_personalized_recipe_recommendation","221497515_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","221260821_Recommending_Food_Reasoning_on_Recipes_and_Ingredients","200552747_FoodLog_capture_analysis_and_retrieval_of_personal_food_images_via_web","51958810_Recipe_recommendation_using_ingredient_networks"]}
