{"id":"318700625_RANKING_OF_EU_NATIONAL_BANKING_SYSTEMS_USING_THE_MULTI-CRITERIA_ANALYSIS_IN_THE_LIGHT_OF_BREXIT","abstract":"In order to define and implement the most effective measures to overcome the difficulties of the after-crisis period, policymakers of ECB must identify not just main weaknesses of each banking system, but their strong points also. This requires the application of multi-criteria analysis, considering that policymakers need to take into account a number of different aspects which on the whole indicate the quality of the banking system. Our aim is to comparative analysis of European banking systems right after the Brexit moment and in the frame of the new Basel III tight regulations. In this paper, we have ranked the EU banking systems using the multi-criteria analysis, more precisely PROMETHEE II method. Usage of PROMETHEE II method in combination with entropy method enabled comprehensive insight in the banking system of each member country, having in mind that observed counties are ranked according to nine strongly conflicting criteria that are mostly used in banking system analysis. Conducted analysis pointed that CEE banking systems are the best performers according to the observed criteria, while the EMUâ€™s developed banking systems, such as German, Italian, British or French, are positioned among the last ranked banking systems. Portuguese or Greek banking systems are, expectantly, ranked on the last positions in our top. Obtained results, also, pointed out that ECB should change its approach to the management and further development of a European Banking Union.","authors":["Magdalena Radulescu","Aleksandra Fedajev","Djordje Nikolic"],"meta":["December 2017Acta Oeconomica 67(4):473-509","DOI:10.1556/032.2017.67.4.1"],"references":["313900840_Challenges_for_the_European_banking_industry","305423837_The_Asymmetric_Implementation_of_the_European_Banking_Union_EBU_Consequences_for_Financial_Stability","299517631_Drivers_of_Bank_Profitability_Case_of_Latvia_and_Lithuania","276123550_Determinants_Of_Bank's_Profitability_In_EU15","272126411_Analysis_of_Business_Environment_Using_the_Multi-Criteria_Approach_-_Case_of_Balkan's_Transition_Economies","271638565_Safety_Evaluation_of_Smart_Grid_based_on_AHP-Entropy_Method","271005619_A_multi-criteria_analysis_of_the_banking_system_in_the_Republic_of_Croatia","270848366_Ownership_Effect_on_Bank's_Performance_Multi_Criteria_Decision_Making_Approaches_on_Foreign_and_Domestic_Turkish_Banks","255566619_ELECTRE-Entropy_method_in_Group_Decision_Support_System_Modelto_Gene_Mutation_Detection","223252277_Fuzzy_performance_evaluation_in_Turkish_Banking_Sector_using_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_and_TOPSIS","220203582_Modelling_banking_sector_stability_with_multicriteria_approaches","24080080_Detecting_falsified_financial_statements_A_comparative_study_using_multicriteria_analysis_and_multivariate_statistical_techniques","314750803_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Making","311522621_Brexit_The_end_or_the_beginning_of_a_long_road","307998874_Brexit_Not_another_Lehman_moment_for_banks","303857412_Bank_restructuring_in_the_EU_Which_way_to_go","299822556_A_Preference_Ranking_Organization_Method_The_Promethee_Method_for_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Making","299544587_Bank_restructuring_in_the_EU_Which_way_to_go","285534068_Competitive_situation_analysis_of_regional_logistics_development_based_on_AHP_and_entropy_weight","284126792_L'ingenierie_de_la_decision_Elaboration_d'instruments_d'aide_a_la_decision_La_methode_PROMETHEE","276535774_Comparative_Analysis_of_Normalization_Procedures_in_TOPSIS_Method_With_an_Application_to_Turkish_Deposit_Banking_Market","267737373_Combining_Time_Series_Analysis_and_Multi_Criteria_Decision_Making_Techniques_for_Forecasting_Financial_Performance_of_Banks_in_Turkey","265015723_Analysis_of_the_financial_parameters_of_Serbian_banks_through_the_application_of_the_fuzzy_AHP_and_TOPSIS_methods","238761193_Multiple_attribute_decision_making_Methods_and_applications_A_state-of-_the-art_survey","233463560_The_PROMETHEE_VI_procedure_How_to_differentiate_hard_from_soft_multicriteria_problems","229657542_Multi-criteria_Classification_Methods_in_Financial_and_Banking_Decisions","223340997_The_PROMCALC_GAIA_decision_support_system_for_multicriteria_decision_aid","223008192_A_multicriteria_decision_support_system_for_bank_rating","222946241_An_evolutionary_approach_to_construction_of_outranking_models_for_multicriteria_classification_The_case_of_the_ELECTRE_TRI_method","222550346_A_fuzzy_MCDM_approach_for_evaluating_banking_performance_based_on_Balanced_Scorecard","220199196_Objective_weights_with_intuitionistic_fuzzy_entropy_measures_and_computational_experiment_analysis","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","46491847_PROMETHEE_A_comprehensive_literature_review_on_methodologies_and_applications","38014710_Multi-criteria_ranking_of_copper_concentrates_according_to_their_quality_-_An_element_of_environmental_management_in_the_vicinity_of_copper_-_Smelting_complex_in_Bor_Serbia","6525557_Entropy_method_for_determination_of_weight_of_evaluating_indicators_in_fuzzy_synthetic_evaluation_for_water_quality_assessment"]}
