{"id":"277556940_A_posteriori_correction_of_camera_characteristics_from_large_image_data_sets","abstract":"Large datasets are emerging in many fields of image processing including: electron microscopy, light\nmicroscopy, medical X-ray imaging, astronomy, etc. Novel computer-controlled instrumentation\nfacilitates the collection of very large datasets containing thousands of individual digital images. In\nsingle-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (“cryo-EM”), for example, large datasets are required\nfor achieving quasi-atomic resolution structures of biological complexes. Based on the collected data\nalone, large datasets allow us to precisely determine the statistical properties of the imaging sensor\non a pixel-by-pixel basis, independent of any “a priori” normalization routinely applied to the raw\nimage data during collection (“flat field correction”). Our straightforward a posteriori correction yields\nclean linear images as can be verified by Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), illustrating the statistical\nindependence of the corrected images over all spatial frequencies. The image sensor characteristics\ncan also be measured continuously and used for correcting upcoming images.","authors":["Pavel Afanasyev","Raimond B. G.
