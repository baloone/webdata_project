Diabetes disease attracts great attention in the\nmachine learning community. Because diabetes is a chronic\ndisease and needs to be detected at an early stage in order to deal\nwith the correct medication. A series of machine learning\ntechniques are used in the work such as Decision Trees (DT),\nLogistic Regressions (LR), Discriminant Analysis (DA), Support\nVector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and\nensemble learners. MATLAB software is considered. Especially,\nthe MATLAB Classification Learner Tool (MCLT) is used. The\nMCLT covers the mentioned machine learning techniques and\ntheir various variants. Thus, a totally 24 classifiers are used in\nthe presented work. The results are evaluated according to the\n10-fold cross-validation criteria and average classification\naccuracy is used for performance measure. The obtained\naverage accuracy scores are in the range of 65.5% and 77.9%.\nThe best accuracy score 77.9% is produced by the LR method\nand the worst one 65.5% is produced by the Coarse Gaussian\nSVM technique.\nKeywords—Machine learning techniques, Diabetes disease,\nPima Indian diabetes dataset, MATLAB classification learner\ntool.","authors":["Adel Ali Al-zebari","Abdulkadir Sengur"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1109/UBMYK48245.2019.8965542","Conference: 2019 1st International Informatics and Software Engineering Conference (UBMYK)"],"references":["330475005_Analysing_Feature_Importances_for_Diabetes_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning","327848015_Prediction_Of_The_Action_Identification_Levels_Of_Teachers_Based_On_Organizational_Commitment_And_Job_Satisfaction_By_Using_K-_Nearest_Neighbors_Method","327847868_Data_Mining_Techniques_Based_Students_Achievements_Analysis","326847703_Prediction_of_The_School_Administrators_Who_Attended_An_Action_Learning_Course_Based_On_Their_Conflict-Handling_Styles_A_Data_Mining_Approach","321847368_Prediction_of_Onset_Diabetes_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","318503093_Machine_Learning_Techniques_for_Classification_of_Diabetes_and_Cardiovascular_Diseases","291313554_A_Method_for_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Technique_for_Diabetes","257334197_Comparative_analysis_of_machine_learning_techniques_in_prognosis_of_type_II_diabetes","225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","333501135_Machine_learning_and_Region_Growing_for_Breast_Cancer_Segmentation","325657620_Prediction_of_Diabetes_using_Classification_Algorithms","306523179_DIAGNOSIS_OF_DIABETIC_RETINOPATHY_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES","305285036_Prediction_and_diagnosis_of_diabetes_mellitus_-_A_machine_learning_approach","258652452_Comparative_Analysis_of_Classification_Algorithms_on_Different_Datasets_using_WEKA","239056767_Discriminatory_Analysis_Nonparametric_Discrimination_Consistency_Properties","236771351_A_Survey_of_Decision_Tree_Classiifer_Methodology_155","220217989_An_expert_system_based_on_linear_discriminant_analysis_and_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_system_to_diagnosis_heart_valve_diseases","6131554_Feature_selection_and_classification_model_construction_on_type_2_diabetic_patients'_data"]}
