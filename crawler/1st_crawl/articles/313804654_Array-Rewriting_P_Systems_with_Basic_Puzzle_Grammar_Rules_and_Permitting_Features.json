{"id":"313804654_Array-Rewriting_P_Systems_with_Basic_Puzzle_Grammar_Rules_and_Permitting_Features","abstract":"Motivated by the problem of tiling the plane, puzzle grammars were introduced as a mechanism for generating languages of picture arrays in the two-dimensional plane. On the other hand BPG array P system with array objects and basic puzzle grammar (BPG) rules was introduced as a variant of array generating P systems that were developed with a view to link the two areas of membrane computing and picture array grammars. Here we incorporate the feature of permitting symbols in the rules of the BPG array P system, thus introducing permitting array P system with BPG rules (pAP(BPG)). We show that the permitting feature gives more generative power to the BPG array P system with one or two membranes. We also show that a pAP(BPG) with only two membranes under tâ€“communication mode, can generate picture arrays of square frames.","authors":["Pradeep Isawasan","Ravie Chandren Muniyandi","Ibrahim Venkat","K G Subramanian"],"meta":["February 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54072-6_17","Conference: International Conference on Membrane Computing","Project: Membrane Computing"],"references":["271922668_Contextual_array_grammars_and_array_P_systems","226266240_Array-rewriting_P_systems","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","294150274_Basic_puzzle_languages","286910524_Picture_languages_-_a_survey","284583822_CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY_OF_TWO-DIMENSIONAL_REGULAR_ARRAY_GRAMMARS","269024423_Basic_puzzle_grammars_and_generation_of_polygons","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","266939726_Formal_models_languages_and_applications","263975367_CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY_OF_TWO-DIMENSIONAL_REGULAR_ARRAY_GRAMMARS","263906468_CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY_OF_PUZZLE_GRAMMARS","263876860_BASIC_PUZZLE_LANGUAGES","263844220_BASIC_PUZZLE_GRAMMARS_AND_ISOSCELES_RIGHT_TRIANGLES","263621490_PUZZLE_GRAMMARS_AND_CONTEXT-FREE_ARRAY_GRAMMARS","262395139_Control_Mechanisms_on_-Context-Free_Array_Grammars","260606754_Array_P_systems_with_permitting_features","240985221_A_Survey_of_Membrane_Computing_as_a_New_Branch_of_Natural_Computing_A_Survey_of_Membrane_Computing_as_a_New_Branch_of_Natural_Computing","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing","233013944_P_Systems_with_array_objects_and_array_rewriting_rules","227171182_Tiling_Rectangular_Pictures_with_P_Systems","223219288_A_P_system_model_with_pure_context-free_rules_for_picture_array_generation","221055467_P_Systems_and_Picture_Languages","221016836_Cooperating_Basic_Puzzle_Grammar_Systems","220444428_Array_P_Systems_and_t-Communication","220444353_Grammar_Systems_versus_Membrane_Computing_The_Case_of_CD_Grammar_Systems","220444174_Tissue-like_P_Systems_with_Active_Membranes_for_Picture_Generation","220360488_Stochastic_Puzzle_Grammars","220360436_Context-Sensitivity_of_Puzzle_Grammars","220118341_A_quick_introduction_to_membrane_computing","31593952_Grammar_Systems_A_Grammatical_Approach_to_Distribution_and_Cooperation","2938299_Grammars_With_Regulated_Rewriting","2422930_Two-Dimensional_Languages"]}
