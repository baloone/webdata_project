{"id":"333746702_A_FAST_ON-LINE_HYBRID_MATCHING_ALGORITHM_FOR_EXACT_STRING_MATCHING","abstract":"String matching technique is the procedure of defining one or more existences of a pattern string inside a larger string or text. This process is applied in the numerous fields of computer science for simplifying the pattern searching operations. Several string searching or string identification algorithms have been identified and continuous studies are being conducted for further improvement. The aim of our proposed algorithm is to develop a fast hybrid string matching algorithm which can reduce the amount of character comparisons than that of ABSBMH algorithm. The combination of some features of the Quick Search Algorithm, SSABS Algorithm and ABSBMH algorithms has been used to determine an enriched process of string identification problem, which will enhance speed and reduce cost. The proposed hybrid algorithm which is called Fast On-line Hybrid Matching Algorithm (FOHM) algorithm has been tested by using different types of dataset.","authors":["Tania Islam","Kamrul Hasan Talukder","Rahat Hossain Faisal"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["323971262_Hash_-_Boyer-Moore_-_Horspool_String_Matching_Algorithm_for_Intrusion_Detection_System","312120578_A_New_Efficient_Hybrid_String_Matching_Algorithm_to_Solve_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem","271302919_Quick-Skip_Search_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem","234025323_On-line_string_matching_algorithms_Survey_and_experimental_results","278399218_Tuning_the_Boyer-Moore-Horspool_string_searching_algorithm","267958409_Start-to-End_Algorithm_for_String_Searching","265663867_An_Algorithm_for_String_Searching_Based_on_Brute-Force_Algorithm","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","241521824_Exact_Multiple_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm_using_DNA_Sequence_and_Pattern_Pair","224960000_A_Fast_String_Searching_Algorithm","220693416_Handbook_of_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithms","220281712_Practical_Fast_Searching_in_Strings","8436547_A_FAST_pattern_matching_algorithm","2415274_Fast_String_Searching","2375410_A_Guided_Tour_to_Approximate_String_Matching"]}
