{"id":"342335386_Big_data_and_artificial_intelligence_in_the_maritime_industry_A_bibliometric_review_and_future_research_directions","abstract":"This study provides a bibliometric review of 279 studies on the applications of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in the maritime industry, published in 214 academic outlets, authored by 842 scholars. We extracted bibliographical data from the Web of Science database and analysed it using the Bibliometrix tool in R software. Based on citation analysis metrics, we revealed the most influential articles, journals, authors and institutions. Using the bibliographic coupling methodology, we identified four underlying research clusters: (1) digital transformation in maritime industry, (2) applications of big data from AIS, (3) energy efficiency and (4) predictive analytics. We analysed these clusters in detail and extracted future research questions. Besides, we present research collaboration networks on the institution and author level.","authors":["Ziaul Haque Munim","Mariia Dushenko","Veronica Jaramillo Jimenez","Mohammad Hassan Shakil"],"meta":["June 2020Maritime Policy & Management 47(5):577-597","DOI:10.1080/03088839.2020.1788731"],"references":["335236324_Towards_Analytics-Enabled_Efficiency_Improvements_in_Maritime_Transportation_A_Case_Study_in_a_Mediterranean_Port","334738291_How_big_data_enriches_maritime_research_-_a_critical_review_of_Automatic_Identification_System_AIS_data_applications","334614088_A_fuzzy_Delphi-AHP-TOPSIS_framework_to_identify_barriers_in_big_data_analytics_adoption_case_of_maritime_organizations","333741126_Semantic_Segmentation_of_SLAR_Imagery_with_Convolutional_LSTM_Selectional_AutoEncoders","333719720_Autonomous_ships_a_review_innovative_applications_and_future_maritime_business_models","332103719_Maritime_Traffic_Data_Visualization_A_Brief_Review","331681907_A_model_predicting_the_PSP_toxic_dinoflagellate_Alexandrium_minutum_occurrence_in_the_coastal_waters_of_the_NW_Adriatic_Sea","331500082_Sustainability_Challenges_in_Maritime_Transport_and_Logistics_Industry_and_Its_Way_Ahead","334814842_MPA-IBM_Project_SAFER_Sense-Making_Analytics_for_Maritime_Event_Recognition","331448741_A_novelty_detection_approach_to_diagnosing_hull_and_propeller_fouling"]}
