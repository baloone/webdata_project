{"id":"3631391_Local_incremental_planning_for_a_car-like_robot_navigating_among_obstacles","abstract":"We present a local approach for planning the motion of a car-like\nrobot navigating among obstacles, suitable for sensor-based\nimplementation. The nonholonomic nature of the robot kinematics is\nexplicitly taken into account. The strategy is to modify the output of a\ngeneric local holonomic planner, so as to provide commands that realize\nthe desired motion in a least-squares sense. A feedback action tends to\nalign the vehicle with the local force field. In order to avoid the\nmotion stops away from the desired goal, various force fields are\nconsidered and compared by simulation","authors":["Alberto Bemporad","Andrea De Luca","Giuseppe Oriolo"],"meta":["May 1996","DOI:10.1109/ROBOT.1996.506871","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Robotics and Automation, 1996.
