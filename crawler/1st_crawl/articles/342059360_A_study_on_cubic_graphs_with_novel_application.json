{"id":"342059360_A_study_on_cubic_graphs_with_novel_application","abstract":"Theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized by computer science applications. Especially in research areas of computer science such as data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing and networking. The cubic graphs are more flexible and compatible than fuzzy graphs due to the fact that they have many applications in networks. In this paper, we define the direct product, strong product, and degree of a vertex in cubic graphs and investigate some of their properties. Likewise, we introduce the notion of complete cubic graphs and present some properties of self complementary cubic graphs. Finally, We present fuzzy cubic organizational model as an example of cubic digraph in decision support system.","authors":["Hossein Rashmanlou","G.
