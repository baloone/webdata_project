{"id":"332022003_Maximum_temperature_of_the_disc_during_repeated_braking_applications","abstract":"A computational finite element model of a brake disc for determining transient axisymmetric (two-dimensional) temperature field during repeated brake application has been proposed. The presented research is a subsequent stage of a previous study on the coupling of velocity and maximum temperature for a single braking in accordance with the system of equations of heat dynamics of friction and wear. In the analysed case, changes in the mean, flash, maximum and bulk temperature of the disc were determined and discussed. The calculations were carried out at the temperature-dependent coefficient of friction, the thermophysical properties of cast-iron disc combined with cermet brake pads and the time-varying contact pressure. The obtained results were compared with the reference values from the braking simulation at constant operating parameters and independent of temperature properties of materials. It was shown that the maximum values of the mean temperature for both cases differed slightly during the entire process. The flash temperature determined from the heat dynamics of friction and wear system of equations was the highest at the beginning and gradually decreased with the number of brake applications.","authors":["Piotr Grzes"],"meta":["March 2019Advances in Mechanical Engineering 11(3):168781401983782","DOI:10.1177/1687814019837826"],"references":["311478006_Effect_of_the_thermal_sensitivity_in_modeling_of_the_frictional_heating_during_braking","321968332_Comparison_of_constraint_analyses_with_global_and_local_approaches_under_uniaxial_and_biaxial_loadings","316530814_Determination_of_the_maximum_temperature_at_single_braking_from_the_FE_solution_of_heat_dynamics_of_friction_and_wear_system_of_equations","316080922_Temperature_in_the_railway_disc_brake_at_a_repetitive_short-term_mode_of_braking","312087444_Structural_and_Contact_Analysis_of_Disc_Brake_Assembly_during_Single_Stop_Braking_Event","303469825_Effect_of_convective_cooling_on_temperature_and_thermal_stresses_in_disk_during_repeated_intermittent_braking","297811727_Integration_of_a_differential_heat_conduction_equation_to_determine_thermal_load_of_a_disk_brake_of_a_mine_locomotive","289600273_Mutual_influence_of_the_sliding_velocity_and_temperature_in_frictional_heating_of_the_thermally_nonlinear_disc_brake","289390634_Braking_of_Road_Vehicles","283036461_Maximum_temperature_in_a_three-disc_thermally_nonlinear_braking_system"]}
