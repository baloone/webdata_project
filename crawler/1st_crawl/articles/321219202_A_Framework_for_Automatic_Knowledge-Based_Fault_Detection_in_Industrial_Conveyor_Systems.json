{"id":"321219202_A_Framework_for_Automatic_Knowledge-Based_Fault_Detection_in_Industrial_Conveyor_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, a framework for automatic generation\nof a flexible and modular system for fault detection and diagnosis\n(FDD) is proposed. The method is based on an ontology-based integration\nframework, which gathers the information from various\nengineering artifacts. Based on the ontologies, FDD functions are\ngenerated based on structural and procedural generation rules.\nThe rules are encoded as SPARQL queries which automatically\nbuild logical segments of the entire manufacturing system in\nthe ontology, assign sub-processes to these segments, and finally\ngenerate the appropriate FDD system for the sub-process. These\ngenerated modular FDD functions are additionally combined in\na modular way to enable the fault detection and diagnosis of the\nentire system. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated\nby a first application to a conveyor system.","authors":["Michael Steinegger","Martin Melik-Merkumians","Johannes Zajc","Georg Schitter"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247705","Conference: 22nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies And Factory AutomationAt: Limassol, Cyprus","Project: Automation and Control for Modular Robotics and Production Systems"],"references":["308796150_Automatic_generation_of_diagnostic_handling_code_for_decentralized_PLC-based_control_architectures","258969748_Knowledge-based_Runtime_Failure_Detection_for_Industrial_Automation_Systems","224264217_Improved_diagnosis_by_combining_structural_and_process_knowledge","316913028_Model-Based_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_-_Status_and_Applications","271497965_Automated_code_generation_for_programmable_logic_controllers_based_on_knowledge_acquisition_from_engineering_artifacts_Concept_and_case_study","255995682_Combining_Knowledge_Modeling_and_Machine_Learning_for_Alarm_Root_Cause_Analysis","222816044_Model-based_fault-detection_and_diagnosis_-_Status_and_applications","222709363_Expert_system_methodologies_and_applications_-_a_decade_review_from_1995_to_2004","222664103_Operational_fault_diagnosis_of_manufacturing_systems","222417127_A_Review_of_Process_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Part_II_Qualitative_Models_and_Search_Strategies","220794080_JADE_a_FIPA2000_compliant_agent_development_environment","4367048_Framework_for_Distributed_Industrial_Automation_and_Control_4DIAC"]}
