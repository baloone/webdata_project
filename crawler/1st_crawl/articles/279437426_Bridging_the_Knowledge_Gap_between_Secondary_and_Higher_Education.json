{"id":"279437426_Bridging_the_Knowledge_Gap_between_Secondary_and_Higher_Education","abstract":"This article suggests several intersections for possible collaboration among different educational levels and disciplines. It describes some of the collaborative work between a physics teacher and a librarian at a high school level. In particular, science-integrated information literacy competencies have been selected that may easily be mapped to, and extended for, higher education. The paper concludes with directions for further study and a crossover between information literacy standards for secondary schools and colleges.","authors":["Zorana Ercegovac"],"meta":["January 2003College & Research Libraries 64(1)","DOI:10.5860/crl.64.1.75"],"references":["271260677_Information_Access_Instruction_IAI4_Design_Principles","234736826_Will_Your_Students_Be_Ready_for_College_Connecting_K-12_and_College_Standards_for_Information_Literacy","293220079_Teaching_to_change_the_world","242073257_The_Roles_of_Academic_Librarians_in_Fostering_a_Pedagogy_for_Information_Literacy","43118323_Faculty-Librarian_Collaboration_in_Building_the_Curriculum_for_the_Millennium_The_US_Experience"]}
