The M06 functional is parametrized\nincluding both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional is a high-nonlocality functional with double\nthe amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals.The functionals, along with the previously\npublished M06-L local functional and the M06-HF full-Hartree–Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of complementary functionals.\nWe assess these four functionals by comparing their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree–Fock theory for\n403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight\ndatabases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation\nenergies, and three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate the performance of these 17 methods for\nthree databases containing 40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies and 15 vibrational zero\npoint energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent\ninteractions, and electronic excitation energies to valence and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application\nin organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent interactions.","authors":["Yan Zhao","Donald Truhlar"],"meta":["April 2008Theoretical Chemistry Accounts 120(1):215-241","DOI:10.1007/s00214-007-0310-x","Project: Development and Assessment of Density Functionals"],"references":["344546788_On_the_calculation_of_correlation_energies_in_the_spin-density_functional_formalism","313755989_Photophysics_of_Aromatic_Molecules","279959665_Progress_in_the_development_of_exchange-correlation_functionals","270957329_Ab_Initio_Calculation_of_Vibrational_Absorption_and_Circular_Dichroism_Spectra_Using_Density_Functional_Force_Fields","263376791_Exchange_energy_functionals_based_on_the_density_matrix_expansion_of_the_Hartree-Fock_exchange_term","263231993_Scaling_Factors_for_Obtaining_Fundamental_Vibrational_Frequencies_and_Zero-Point_Energies_from_HF6-31G_and_MP26-31G_Harmonic_Frequencies","260974035_Tests_of_second-generation_and_third-generation_density_functionals_for_thermochemical_kineticsElectronic_supplementary_information_ESI_available_Mean_errors_for_pure_and_hybrid_DFT_methods_See_httpww","257993539_A_Novel_Form_for_the_Exchange-Correlation_Energy_Functional","256789171_Handbook_on_Metalloproteins","253653013_N2_excitations_below_15_eV_by_the_multireference_coupled-cluster_method"]}
