{"id":"325430512_k_-broadcast_domination_and_k_-multipacking","abstract":"We generalize broadcast domination by requiring that every vertex must hear a broadcast from each of k different vertices. Some basic theory of k-broadcast domination and its dual problem, k-multipacking, is developed. We then focus on 2-broadcast domination and show that the 2-broadcast domination number is at most three times the broadcast domination number, but can differ by any additive amount from twice the broadcast domination number. It is shown that the 2-broadcast domination number of a connected graph with n vertices is at most [Formula presented].","authors":["Michael A.
