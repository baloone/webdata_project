{"id":"323348771_The_Differential_Inclusion_Modeling_FISTA_Algorithm_and_Optimality_of_Convergence_Rate_in_the_Case_b_leq3","abstract":"In this paper we are interested in the differential inclusion 0 ∈ x¨(t) +bt x (t) + ∂F(x(t)) in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space Rd, where F is a proper, convex, lower semicontinuous function. The motivation of this study is that the differential inclusion models the FISTA algorithm as considered in [A. Chambolle and C. Dossal, J. Optim. Theory Appl., 166 (2015), pp. 968–982]. In particular, we investigate the different asymptotic properties of solutions for this inclusion for b > 0. We show that the convergence rate of F(x(t)) towards the minimum of F is of order of O(t⁻²3b ) when 0 < b < 3, while for b > 3 this order is of o(t−²) and the solution-trajectory converges to a minimizer of F. These results generalize the ones obtained in the differential setting (where F is differentiable) in [H. Attouch, Z. Chbani, J. Peypouquet, and P. Redont, Math. Program., 2016, pp. 1–53], [H. Attouch, Z. Chbani, and H. Riahi, arXiv:1706.05671, 2017], [J. Aujol and C. Dossal, Optimal Rate of Convergence of an ODE Associated to the Fast Gradient Descent Schemes for b > 0, 2017], and [W. Su, S. Boyd, and E. J. Candes, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 17 (2016), pp. 1–43]. In addition, we show that the order of the convergence rate O(t⁻ 3) of F(x(t)) towards the minimum 2b is optimal, in the case of low friction b < 3, by making a particular choice of F.","authors":["Apidopoulos Vassilis","Aujol Jean-François","Dossal Charles"],"meta":["January 2018SIAM Journal on Optimization 28(1):551-574","DOI:10.1137/17M1128642"],"references":["270649199_Asymptotics_for_a_second-order_differential_equation_with_nonautonomous_damping_and_an_integrable_source_term","276459455_On_the_Convergence_of_the_Iterates_of_the_Fast_Iterative_ShrinkageThresholding_Algorithm"]}
