{"id":"305726961_Talkoo_A_new_paradigm_for_physical_computing_at_school","abstract":"Introducing physical computing into regular school classes is challenged by constraints of schedules and curricula structures, which do not allow for time-consuming electronics prototyping. We present a novel approach to prototyping with physical computing components with the Arduino-based TALKOO kit: It comprises hardware modules, a visual IDE and prototyping material. Sensor and actuator modules are pluggable and do not require soldering and prior knowledge in electronics. The components have the ability to \"talk\" back to the visual IDE and to a learning analytics system. A new paradigm for visual programming maps physical modules onto virtual representations on screen making programming more intuitive. The TALKOO kit expands the field of application of physical computing for children in regular school contexts. Preliminary evaluation results show that children were able to build elaborative prototypes within an hour.","authors":["Eva-Sophie Katterfeldt","David Cuartielles","Daniel Spikol","Nils Ehrenberg"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2930674.2935990","Conference: the 15th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children","Project: PELARS"],"references":["288872085_Computationally_Enhanced_Toolkits_for_Children_Historical_Review_and_a_Framework_for_Future_Design","259581958_End-User_Experiences_of_Visual_and_Textual_Programming_Environments_for_Arduino","221238266_Modkit_Blending_and_extending_approachable_platforms_for_creating_computer_programs_and_interactive_objects","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","282770364_Electronics_as_material_Littlebits","263471685_Considering_Visual_Programming_Environments_for_Documenting_Physical_Computing_Artifacts","262286573_LightUp_An_augmented_learning_platform_for_electronics","238695840_Taxonomies_of_Visual_Programming_P_and_rogram_Visualization","225083836_Education_at_a_Glance","223115349_Taxonomies_of_Visual_Programming_and_Program_Visualization","221308593_Electronics_as_material_Littlebits"]}
