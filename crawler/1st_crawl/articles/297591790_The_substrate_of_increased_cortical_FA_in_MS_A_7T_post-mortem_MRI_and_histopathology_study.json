{"id":"297591790_The_substrate_of_increased_cortical_FA_in_MS_A_7T_post-mortem_MRI_and_histopathology_study","abstract":"Background: \nUsing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), it was previously found that demyelinated gray matter (GM) lesions have increased fractional anisotropy (FA) when compared to normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The biological substrate underlying this FA change is so far unclear; both neurodegenerative changes and microglial activation have been proposed as causal contributors.\n\nObjective: \nTo test the proposed hypothesis that microglia activation is responsible for increased FA in cortical GM lesions.\n\nMethods: \nWe investigated post-mortem cortical DTI changes in hemispheric, coronally cut sections and investigated the underlying histopathology using immunohistochemistry.\n\nResults: \nOverall, there were few activated microglia/macrophages, and no difference between GM lesions and NAGM was observed. However, cell density was increased in GM lesions compared to NAGM (309.67 ± standard deviation (SD) 124.44 vs 249.95 ± SD 56.75, p = 0.002).\n\nConclusion: \nFA increase was not due to lesional and non-lesional differences in microglia activation and/or proliferation. We found an increase in general cellular density without a notable difference in cellular size, that is, tissue compaction, as a possible alternative explanation.","authors":["Laura E Jonkman","Roel Klaver","Lazar Fleysher","Matilde Inglese"],"meta":["March 2016Multiple Sclerosis 22(14)","DOI:10.1177/1352458516635290"],"references":["270966920_What_drives_MRI-measured_cortical_atrophy_in_multiple_sclerosis","260375411_Oligodendroglia_in_cortical_multiple_sclerosis_lesions_decrease_with_disease_progression_but_regenerate_after_repeated_experimental_demyelination","230712141_Microstructural_MR_imaging_of_cortical_lesion_in_multiple_sclerosis","51099264_Intracortical_Lesions_by_3T_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_and_Correlation_with_Cognitive_Impairment_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","51033225_Diffusion_imaging_of_whole_post-mortem_human_brains_on_a_clinical_MRI_scanner","10626935_Subpial_Demyelination_in_the_Cerebral_Cortex_of_Multiple_Sclerosis_Patients","7983413_The_Pathology_of_Multiple_Sclerosis_Is_Location-Dependent_No_Significant_Complement_Activation_Is_Detected_in_Purely_Cortical_Lesions","280582378_Ultra-High-Field_MRI_Visualization_of_Cortical_Multiple_Sclerosis_Lesions_with_T2_and_T2_A_Postmortem_MRI_and_Histopathology_Study","274727063_Neuronal_and_Axonal_Loss_in_Normal-Appearing_Gray_Matter_and_Subpial_Lesions_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","268232556_Non-Gaussian_Diffusion_MRI_of_gray_matter_is_associated_with_cognitive_impairment_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","232280958_Cortical_Remyelination_A_New_Target_for_Repair_Therapies_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","230843257_Heterogeneity_of_cortical_lesions_in_multiple_sclerosis_Clinical_and_pathologic_implications","228325134_Increased_PK11195_PET_binding_in_the_cortex_of_patients_with_MS_correlates_with_disability","51983013_Postmortem_verification_of_MS_cortical_lesion_detection_with_3D_DIR","51749460_Cortical_Diffusion-Tensor_Imaging_Abnormalities_in_Multiple_Sclerosis_A_3-year_Longitudinal_Study","51699311_FSL","51116896_Imaging_the_tip_of_the_iceberg_Visualization_of_cortical_lesions_in_multiple_sclerosis","24421182_Accumulation_of_cortical_lesions_in_MS_Relation_with_cognitive_impairment","24246321_Promotion_of_Central_Nervous_System_Remyelination_by_Induced_Differentiation_of_Oligodendrocyte_Precursor_Cells","13511600_Identification_of_glial_cell_proliferation_in_early_multiple_sclerosis_lesions","11788755_Transected_neurites_apoptotic_neurons_and_reduced_inflammation_in_cortical_multiple_sclerosis_lesions","10606824_Intracortical_multiple_sclerosis_lesions_are_not_associated_with_increased_lymphocyte_infiltration","6409414_The_Blood-Brain_Barrier_in_Cortical_Multiple_Sclerosis_Lesions","5656947_Diffusion-Tensor_MR_Imaging_of_Cortical_Lesions_in_Multiple_Sclerosis_Initial_Findings_1"]}
