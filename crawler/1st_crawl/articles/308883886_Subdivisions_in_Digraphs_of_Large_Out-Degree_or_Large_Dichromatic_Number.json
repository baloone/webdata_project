{"id":"308883886_Subdivisions_in_Digraphs_of_Large_Out-Degree_or_Large_Dichromatic_Number","abstract":"In 1985, Mader conjectured the existence of a function $f$ such that every digraph with minimum out-degree at least $f(k)$ contains a subdivision of the transitive tournament of order $k$. This conjecture is still completely open, as the existence of $f(5)$ remains unknown. In this paper, we show that if $D$ is an oriented path, or an in-arborescence (i.e., a tree with all edges oriented towards the root) or the union of two directed paths from $x$ to $y$ and a directed path from $y$ to $x$, then every digraph with minimum out-degree large enough contains a subdivision of $D$. Additionally, we study Mader's conjecture considering another graph parameter. The dichromatic number of a digraph $D$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $D$ can be partitioned into $k$ acyclic subdigraphs. We show that any digraph with dichromatic number greater than $4^m (n-1)$ contains every digraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs as a subdivision.","authors":["Pierre Aboulker","Nathann Cohen","Fr√©deric Havet","William Lochet"],"meta":["October 2016The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 26(3)","DOI:10.37236/6521"],"references":["297738439_The_Erd_os-Posa_Property_for_Directed_Graphs","268689587_The_Directed_Grid_Theorem","307955917_Zur_allgemeinen_kurventheorie","303521200_Subdivisions_of_oriented_cycles_in_digraphs_with_large_chromatic_number","268758353_Antidirected_subtrees_of_directed_graphs","267142325_Some_problems_in_graph_theory","266833567_Subtrees_of_directed_graphs_and_hypergraphs","247044898_On_the_Representation_of_Directed_Graphs_as_Unions_of_Orderings","233547394_The_Erdos-Sos_Conjecture_for_Graphs_without_C_4","230352691_Some_Homeomorphism_Properties_of_Graphs"]}
