{"id":"221316579_Subdivision_Schemes_and_Attractors","abstract":"Subdivision schemes generate self-similar curves and surfaces. There fore there is a close connection between curves and surfaces generated by subdivision algorithms and self-similar fractals generated by Iterated Function Systems (IFS). We demonstrate that this connection between subdivision s chemes and fractals is even deeper by showing that curves and surfaces generated by subdivision are also attr actors, fixed points of IFS's. To illustrate this fractal nature of subdivision, we derive the associated IFS for many dif ferent subdivision curves and surfaces without extraordinary vertices, including B-splines, piecewise Bezier, in terpolatory four-point subdivision, bicubic subdivision, three-direction quartic box-spline subdivision and Kobbelt's p 3-subdivision surfaces.
