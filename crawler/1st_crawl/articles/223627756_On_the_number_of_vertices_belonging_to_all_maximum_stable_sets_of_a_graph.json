{"id":"223627756_On_the_number_of_vertices_belonging_to_all_maximum_stable_sets_of_a_graph","abstract":"Let us denote by α(G) the size of a maximum stable set, and by μ(G) the size of a maximum matching of a graph G, and let ξ(G) be the number of vertices which belong to all maximum stable sets. We shall show that ξ(G)⩾1+α(G)−μ(G) holds for any connected graph, whenever α(G)>μ(G). This inequality improves on related results by Hammer et al. (SIAM J. Algebraic Discrete Methods 3 (1982) 511) and by Levit and Mandrescu [(prE-print math. CO/9912047 (1999) 13pp.)].We also prove that on one hand, ξ(G)>0 can be recognized in polynomial time whenever μ(G)<|V(G)|/3, and on the other hand determining whether ξ(G)>k is, in general, NP-complete for any fixed k⩾0.","authors":["Endre Boros","Martin Golumbic","Vadim Levit"],"meta":["December 2002Discrete Applied Mathematics 124(1-3):17-25","DOI:10.1016/S0166-218X(01)00327-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226824402_The_Ellipsoid_Method_and_its_Consequences_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","2143255_Combinatorial_Properties_of_the_Family_of_Maximum_Stable_Sets_of_a_Graph","313171841_On_representatives_of_subsets","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","265332608_Vertices_Belonging_to_All_or_to_No_Maximum_Stable_Sets_of_a_Graph","256743408_Representatives_of_subsets","229753807_The_structure_and_maximum_number_of_maximum_independent_sets_in_trees","225869950_On_Representatives_of_Subsets","220569820_Graphs_whose_Vertex_Independence_Number_is_Unaffected_by_Single_Edge_Addition_of_Deletion"]}
