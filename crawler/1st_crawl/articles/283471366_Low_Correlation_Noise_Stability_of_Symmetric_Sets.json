{"id":"283471366_Low_Correlation_Noise_Stability_of_Symmetric_Sets","abstract":"We study the Gaussian noise stability of subsets A of Euclidean space\nsatisfying A=-A. It is shown that an interval centered at the origin, or its\ncomplement, maximizes noise stability for small correlation, among symmetric\nsubsets of the real line of fixed Gaussian measure. In the plane, we show that\na ball or its complement locally maximizes noise stability for small\ncorrelation, among symmetric sets of fixed Gaussian volume. Some asymptotic\nresults are proven in higher-dimensional Euclidean space. In summary, we\nprovide the first known positive results for the Symmetric Gaussian Problem.","authors":["Steven Heilman"],"meta":["December 2021Journal of Theoretical Probability 34(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10959-020-01031-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["336394768_Symmetry_of_minimizers_of_a_Gaussian_isoperimetric_problem","318304131_Local_minimality_of_the_ball_for_the_Gaussian_perimeter","317010266_Symmetric_Convex_Sets_with_Minimal_Gaussian_Surface_Area","268608520_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions","268163428_Euclidean_partitions_optimizing_noise_stability","265548129_Learning_DNF_in_time_2_O_n_13","264968350_Semigroup_proofs_of_the_isoperimetric_inequality_in_Euclidean_and_Gauss_space","262361915_Learning_DNF_in_time","261469587_The_Correct_Exponent_for_the_Gotsman-Linial_Conjecture","260520661_Standard_Simplices_and_Pluralities_are_Not_the_Most_Noise_Stable","260483189_Isoperimetry_and_Stability_Properties_of_Balls_with_Respect_to_Nonlocal_Energies","248382209_A_two-sided_estimate_for_the_Gaussian_noise_stability_deficit","243112012_On_the_first_and_second_variations_of_a_nonlocal_isoperimetric_problem","240747357_Noise_stability_of_functions_with_low_influences_invariance_and_optimality_Extended_Abstract","239230352_Topics_in_Optimal_Transportation_Theory"]}
