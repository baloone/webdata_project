{"id":"320679289_Non-binary_evaluation_measures_for_big_data_integration","abstract":"The evolution of data accumulation, management, analytics, and visualization has led to the coining of the term big data, which challenges the task of data integration. This task, common to any matching problem in computer science involves generating alignments between structured data in an automated fashion. Historically, set-based measures, based upon binary similarity matrices (match/non-match), have dominated evaluation practices of matching tasks. However, in the presence of big data, such measures no longer suffice. In this work, we propose evaluation methods for non-binary matrices as well. Non-binary evaluation is formally defined together with several new, non-binary measures using a vector space representation of matching outcome. We provide empirical analyses of the usefulness of non-binary evaluation and show its superiority over its binary counterparts in several problem domains.","authors":["Tomer Sagi","Avigdor Gal"],"meta":["February 2018The VLDB Journal 27(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00778-017-0489-y"],"references":["313610493_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_fmeasure_to_roc_informedness_markedness_and_correlation","266871293_Matching_and_Alignment_What_Is_the_Cost_of_User_Post-Match_Effort","264197234_In_schema_matching_even_experts_are_human_Towards_expert_sourcing_in_schema_matching","262313837_Pay-As-You-Go_Data_Integration_Using_Functional_Dependencies","259005825_Non-Binary_Evaluation_for_Schema_Matching","328256156_Metric_Spaces_Iteration_and_Application","313693789_Principles_and_Procedures_of_Statistics","272887449_Optimization_by_Vector_Space_Method","265775504_An_optimal_theory_of_record_linkage","262208815_Mechanical_Turk_as_an_Ontology_Engineer_Using_Microtasks_as_a_Component_of_an_Ontology-Engineering_Workflow","257457920_Schema_matching_prediction_with_applications_to_data_source_discovery_and_dynamic_ensembling","257158069_MFIBlocks_An_effective_blocking_algorithm_for_entity_resolution","252292779_Schema_Matching_and_Mapping","246816091_Metric_Spaces_Iteration_and_Application","235955876_Autoplex_Automated_Discovery_of_Contents_for_Virtual_Databases"]}
