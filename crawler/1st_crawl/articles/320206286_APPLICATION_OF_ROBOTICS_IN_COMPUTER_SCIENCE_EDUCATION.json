{"id":"320206286_APPLICATION_OF_ROBOTICS_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_EDUCATION","abstract":"Diversification of programming activities increases the activity, interest and effectiveness of learning. The use of robotics solves some problems related to the abstract style of work in this discipline. The paper will present a model for the application of robotics in the formal and informal education of students of all age groups and school degrees in programming and computer modeling. It will be commented on the experience of training with pupils from an Ðµlementary school in clubs in computer modeling; whit middle school students in a robotics club, and with high school students who study computer science as a profiling school subject.","authors":["Todorka Glushkova","Diyana Plachkova"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.26883/2010.171.281","Project: Robotics for Bulgaria"],"references":[]}
