A 2D-LASM chaotic system is used to generate a random key stream. First, a Boolean network is coded, and a Boolean matrix is generated. If necessary, the Boolean network matrix is diffused in one round so that the Boolean matrix can be saved in the form of an image. Then, three random position scramblings are used to scramble the plaintext image. Finally, using a matrix semi-tensor product technique to generate an encrypted image in a second round of diffusion, a new Boolean network can be generated by encoding the encrypted image. In secure communications, users can choose to implement an image encryption transmission or a Boolean network encryption transmission according to their own needs. Compared with other algorithms, this algorithm exhibits good security characteristics.","authors":["Xingyuan Wang","Suo Gao"],"meta":["August 2019Information Sciences 507(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2019.08.041"],"references":["331168304_A_New_Hybrid_Digital_Chaotic_System_with_Applications_in_Image_Encryption","330482930_Global_Robust_Synchronization_of_Fractional_Order_Complex_Valued_Neural_Networks_with_Mixed_Time_Varying_Delays_and_Impulses","330436758_Stability_and_synchronization_criteria_for_fractional_order_competitive_neural_networks_with_time_delays_An_asymptotic_expansion_of_Mittag_Leffler_function","329876077_Cosine-Transform-Based_Chaotic_System_for_Image_Encryption","325954834_Image_encryption_using_2D_Henon-Sine_map_and_DNA_approach","324492472_Social_Anchor-Unit_Graph_Regularized_Tensor_Completion_for_Large-Scale_Image_Retagging","322525001_Brief_review_on_application_of_nonlinear_dynamics_in_image_encryption","308092146_Tri-Clustered_Tensor_Completion_for_Social-Aware_Image_Tag_Refinement","277917851_A_new_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_a_simple_first-order_time-delay_system_with_appropriate_nonlinearity","263398552_A_new_secure_and_sensitive_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_new_substitution_with_chaotic_function","331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","329354507_Further_mean-square_asymptotic_stability_of_impulsive_discrete-time_stochastic_BAM_neural_networks_with_Markovian_jumping_and_time-varying_delays","328128449_Fractional_delay_segments_method_on_time-delayed_recurrent_neural_networks_with_impulsive_and_stochastic_effects_An_exponential_stability_approach","327995826_Novel_results_on_passivity_and_exponential_passivity_for_multiple_discrete_delayed_neutral-type_neural_networks_with_leakage_and_distributed_time-delays","324527682_Generalized_inverses_of_tensors_via_a_general_product_of_tensors","322090239_Designing_permutation-substitution_image_encryption_networks_with_Henon_map","318797618_Exploiting_self-adaptive_permutation-diffusion_and_DNA_random_encoding_for_secure_and_efficient_image_encryption","317833396_Exponential_Stability_Passivity_and_Dissipativity_Analysis_of_Generalized_Neural_Networks_With_Mixed_Time-Varying_Delays","307533293_A_novel_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_using_DNA_sequence_operations","301302789_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_substitution-permutation_network_and_chaos","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","283089705_Circular_inter-intra_bit-level_permutation_and_chaos_based_image_encryption","278168930_A_fast_chaos-based_symmetric_image_cryptosystem_with_an_improved_diffusion_scheme","275218996_On_solutions_of_the_matrix_equation_AXB_with_respect_to_semi-tensor_product","271860478_A_new_image_alternate_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_map","269589453_Semi-tensor_product_of_matrices-A_convenient_new_tool","267012117_Hyperchaotic_Lorenz_system","265853353_A_novel_chaotic_block_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_dynamic_random_growth_technique","265491150_Principle_and_range_of_possible_applications_of_the_semi-tensor_product_of_matrices","262191712_A_symmetric_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_mixed_linear-nonlinear_coupled_map_lattice","260629597_An_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_new_spatiotemporal_chaos","260516397_State_Feedback_Stabilization_for_Boolean_Control_Networks","260354169_Complete_Synchronization_of_Boolean_Networks","257627542_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_hyper-chaos_and_DNA_sequence","256973775_Double_optical_image_encryption_using_discrete_Chirikov_standard_map_and_chaos-based_fractional_random_transform","223398112_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_self-adaptive_wave_transmission","222997094_A_new_chaos-based_fast_image_encryption_algorithm","222646844_A_symmetric_image_encryption_based_on_3D_chaotic_cat_maps","222574474_Measures_for_information_propagation_in_Boolean_networks","222562981_Controllability_and_Observability_of_Boolean_Control_Networks","220563033_Controlling_hyperchaos_in_the_new_hyperchaotic_Chen_system","220225771_A_novel_color_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos","48193311_A_chaotic_system_with_only_one_stable_equilibrium","10731142_Fundamentals_of_synchronization_in_chaotic_systems_concepts_and_applications","8359144_Boolean_Logic_Functions_of_a_Synthetic_Peptide_Network"]}
