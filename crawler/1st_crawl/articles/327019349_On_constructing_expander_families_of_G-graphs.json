{"id":"327019349_On_constructing_expander_families_of_G-graphs","abstract":"Like Cayley graphs, G-graphs are graphs that are constructed from groups. A method for constructing expander families of G-graphs is presented and is used to construct new expander families of irregular graphs. This technique depends on a relation between some known expander families of Cayley graphs and certain expander families of G-graphs. Several other properties of expander families of G-graphs are presented. © 2018 Society of Mathematicians Physicists and Astronomers of Slovenia.
