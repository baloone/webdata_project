{"id":"312946929_Two-Party_Function_Computation_on_the_Reconciled_Data","abstract":"Assume a distributed system with two users, each user possesses a collection of binary strings. We introduce a new problem termed function computation on the reconciled data, which generalizes a set reconciliation problem in the literature. It is shown that any deterministic protocol that computes a sum and a product of reconciled sets of nonnegative integers has to communicate at least $2^n + n - 1$ and $2^n + n - 3$ bits in the worst-case scenario, respectively, where $n$ is the length of the binary string representations of the numbers. Connections to other problems in computer science, such as set disjointness and finding the intersection, are established, yielding a variety of additional bounds on the communication complexity. A protocol, which is based on use of a family of hash functions is presented, and its characteristics are analyzed.","authors":["Ivo Kubjas","Vitaly Skachek"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["261170589_Invertible_Bloom_Lookup_Tables","269269608_Subspace_synchronization_A_network-coding_approach_to_object_reconciliation","266659341_Beyond_set_disjointness_The_communication_complexity_of_finding_the_intersection","262246908_On_the_Complexity_of_Communication_Complexity","260740100_The_complexity_of_object_reconciliation_and_open_problems_related_to_set_difference_and_coding","238677868_Some_complexity_questions_related_to_distributed_computing","230609102_Biff_Bloom_Filter_Codes_Fast_Error_Correction_for_Large_Data_Sets","222495627_Communication_Complexity","222431754_An_Information_Statistics_Approach_to_Data_Stream_and_Communication_Complexity","222289867_On_the_Distributional_Complexity_of_Disjointness","221591676_Some_Complexity_Questions_Related_to_Distributive_Computing_Preliminary_Report","221591549_Lower_bounds_for_VLSI","221164148_What's_the_Difference_Efficient_Set_Reconciliation_without_Prior_Context","220690121_Communication_Complexity","220689472_Extremal_combinatorics_With_applications_in_computer_science"]}
