{"id":"333187169_How_to_perform_and_report_an_impactful_analysis_using_partial_least_squares_Guidelines_for_confirmatory_and_explanatory_IS_research","abstract":"Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) is an estimator that has found widespread application for causal information systems (IS) research. Recently, the method has been subject to many improvements, such as consistent PLS (PLSc) for latent variable models, a bootstrap-based test for overall model fit, and the heterotrait-to-monotrait ratio of correlations for assessing discriminant validity. Scholars who would like to rigorously apply PLS-PM need updated guidelines for its use. This paper explains how to perform and report empirical analyses using PLS-PM including the latest enhancements, and illustrates its application with a fictive example on business value of social media.","authors":["Jose Benitez","JÃ¶rg Henseler","Ana Castillo","Florian Schuberth"],"meta":["March 2020Information & Management 57(2):103168","DOI:10.1016/j.im.2019.05.003"],"references":["334317724_Robust_partial_least_squares_path_modeling","329276908_PLS_path_modeling_-_a_confirmatory_approach_to_study_tourism_technology_and_tourist_behavior","329238451_Confirmatory_Composite_Analysis","327744077_Measurement_error_correlation_within_blocks_of_indicators_in_consistent_partial_least_squares_Issues_and_remedies","327366302_A_Test_for_Multigroup_Comparison_in_Partial_Least_Squares_Path_Modeling","325312738_PLS-Based_Model_Selection_The_Role_of_Alternative_Explanations_in_Information_Systems_Research","325134109_Addressing_Endogeneity_in_International_Marketing_Applications_of_Partial_Least_Squares_Structural_Equation_Modeling","331703543_Confirmatory_Composite_Analysis","328809272_How_information_technology_influences_opportunity_exploration_and_exploitation_firms_capabilities","324582830_How_do_social_commerce-IT_capabilities_influence_firm_performance_Theory_and_empirical_evidence"]}
