{"id":"277948408_Lensless_phase_microscopy_and_diffraction_tomography_with_multi-angle_and_multi-wavelength_illuminations_using_a_LED_matrix","abstract":"We demonstrate lensless quantitative phase microscopy and diffraction tomography based on a compact on-chip platform, using only a CMOS image sensor and a programmable color LED matrix. Based on the multi-wavelength phase retrieval and multi-angle illumination diffraction tomography, this platform offers high quality, depth resolved images with a lateral resolution of 3.72μm and an axial resolution of 5μm, across a wide field-of-view of 24mm<sup>2</sup>. We experimentally demonstrate the success of our method by imaging cheek cells, micro-beads, and fertilized eggs of Parascaris equorum. Such high-throughput and miniaturized imaging device can provide a cost-effective tool for telemedicine applications and point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited environments.","authors":["Chao Zuo","Jiasong Sun","Jialin Zhang","Yan Hu"],"meta":["June 2015Optics Express 23(11):14314","DOI:10.1364/OE.23.014314"],"references":["275365085_Phase_retrieval_with_the_transport-of-intensity_equation_in_an_arbitrarily_shaped_aperture_by_iterative_discrete_cosine_transforms","267274917_Transport_of_intensity_phase_imaging_in_the_presence_of_curl_effects_induced_by_strongly_absorbing_photomasks","265971379_Illumination_coherence_engineering_and_quantitative_phase_imaging","264128866_Boundary-artifact-free_phase_retrieval_with_the_transport_of_intensity_equation_II_Applications_to_microlens_characterization","263743945_Phase_discrepancy_analysis_and_compensation_for_fast_Fourier_transform_based_solution_of_the_transport_of_intensity_equation","263710611_Multiplexed_coded_illumination_for_Fourier_Ptychography_with_an_LED_array_microscope","261403938_White-light_diffraction_tomography_of_unlabeled_live_cells","260375013_Lensless_phase_contrast_microscopy_based_on_multiwavelength_Fresnel_diffraction","260206053_Corrigendum_Wide-field_high-resolution_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy","259252728_Quantitative_phase_imaging_via_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy","256453146_Fourier_phase_microscopy_with_white_light","241698007_High-resolution_three-dimensional_imaging_of_red_blood_cells_parasitized_by_Plasmodium_falciparum_and_in_situ_hemozoin_crystals_using_optical_diffraction_tomography","236038472_Transport-of-intensity_phase_imaging_using_Savitzky-Golay_differentiation_filter_-_theory_and_applications","229998862_Tomographic_Phase_Microscopy","221975002_Diffraction_phase_microscopy_with_white_light","221725025_Phase-retrival_stagnation_problems_and_solutions","51691200_The_ePetri_dish_an_on-chip_cell_imaging_platform_based_on_subpixel_perspective_sweeping_microscopy_SPSM","49782334_Spatial_light_interference_microscopy_SLIM","49689497_Phase_from_chromatic_aberrations","43183957_Compact_Light-weight_and_Cost-effective_Microscope_based_on_Lensless_Incoherent_Holography_for_Telemedicine_Applications","26269098_High-resolution_quantitative_phase-contrast_microscopy_by_digital_holography","23764698_Optical_Diffraction_Tomography_for_High_Resolution_Live_Cell_Imaging","7945578_Digital_holographic_microscopy_A_noninvasive_contrast_imaging_technique_allowing_quantitative_visualization_of_living_cells_with_subwavelength_axial_accuracy","6145606_Tomographic_phase_microscopy","5574179_Phase_retrieval_using_multiple_illumination_wavelengths","275528421_Transport_of_intensity_phase_retrieval_and_computational_imaging_for_partially_coherent_fields_The_phase_space_perspective","263842372_Three-dimensional_imaging_by_a_microscope","263783395_Transport_of_Intensity_Imaging_with_Higher_Order_Derivatives","262023868_Boundary-artifact-free_phase_retrieval_with_the_transport_of_intensity_equation_Fast_solution_with_use_of_discrete_cosine_transform","257534149_Noninterferometric_single-shot_quantitative_phase_microscopy","243772443_Deterministic_phase_retrieval-a_green-function_solution_J_Opt_Soc_Am","243474269_Noninterferometric_Phase_Imaging_with_Partially_Coherent_Light","222712154_Phase_retrieval_using_radiation_and_matter-wave_fields_Validity_of_Teague's_method_for_solution_of_the_transport-of-intensity_equation","222447022_Three-Dimensional_Structure_Determination_of_Semi-Transparent_Objects_from_Holographic_Data","222123822_Quantitative_phase_tomography","221841663_Phase_imaging_flow_cytometry_using_a_focus-stack_collecting_microscope","221725051_A_practical_algorithm_for_the_determination_of_phase_from_image_and_diffraction_plane_pictures","51062589_Lens-free_optical_tomographic_microscope_with_a_large_imaging_volume_on_a_chip","44852374_Transport_of_Intensity_imaging_with_higher_order_derivatives","26761749_Inverse-scattering_theory_within_the_Rytov_approximation"]}
