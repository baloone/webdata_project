{"id":"325563452_On_an_Elliptical_Trust-Region_Procedure_for_Ill-Posed_Nonlinear_Least-Squares_Problems","abstract":"In this paper, we address the stable numerical solution of ill-posed nonlinear least-squares problems with small residual. We propose an elliptical trust-region reformulation of a Levenbergâ€“Marquardt procedure. Thanks to an appropriate choice of the trust-region radius, the proposed procedure guarantees an automatic choice of the free regularization parameters that, together with a suitable stopping criterion, ensures regularizing properties to the method. Specifically, the proposed procedure generates a sequence that even in case of noisy data has the potential to approach a solution of the unperturbed problem. The case of constrained problems is considered, too. The effectiveness of the procedure is shown on several examples of ill-posed least-squares problems.","authors":["Stefania Bellavia","Elisa Riccietti"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 178(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10957-018-1318-1"],"references":["316040988_Iterated_Tikhonov_regularization_with_a_general_penalty_term","305750350_Regularizing_preconditioners_by_non-stationary_iterated_Tikhonov_with_general_penalty_term","275055429_On_an_adaptive_regularization_for_ill-posed_nonlinear_systems_and_its_trust-region_implementation","273525444_Nonlinear_ill-posed_problem_analysis_in_model-based_parameter_estimation_and_experimental_design","321620224_Numerical_Optimization","317670005_A_Limited_Memory_BFGS_method_for_a_nonlinear_inverse_problem_in_digital_breast_tomosynthesis","285906939_Numerical_optimization","266226597_Functions_of_Matrices_Theory_and_Computation","262358276_Parameter_Estimation_Regularity_and_the_Penalty_Method_for_a_Class_of_Two_Point_Boundary_Value_Problems","260873044_Regularized_solution_of_a_nonlinear_problem_in_electromagnetic_sounding","260399814_On_the_Regularity_of_a_Trust_Region-CG_Algorithm_for_Nonlinear_Ill-posed_Inverse_Problems","258275640_Fast_nonstationary_preconditioned_iterative_methods_for_ill-posed_problems_with_application_to_image_deblurring","247045620_On_the_regularization_of_nonlinear_ill-posed_problems_via_inexact_Newton_iterations","246567647_Iterative_Regularization_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Ill-Posed_Problems","243096167_Optimal_a_Posteriori_Parameter_Choice_for_Tikhonov_Regularization_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Ill-Posed_Problems"]}
