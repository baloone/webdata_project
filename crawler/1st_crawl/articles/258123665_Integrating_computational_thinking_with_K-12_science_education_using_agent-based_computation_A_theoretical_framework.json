{"id":"258123665_Integrating_computational_thinking_with_K-12_science_education_using_agent-based_computation_A_theoretical_framework","abstract":"Computational thinking (CT) draws on concepts and practices that are fundamental to computing and computer science. It includes epistemic and represen-tational practices, such as problem representation, abstraction, decomposition, simu-lation, verification, and prediction. However, these practices are also central to the development of expertise in scientific and mathematical disciplines. Recently, argu-ments have been made in favour of integrating CT and programming into the K-12 STEM curricula. In this paper, we first present a theoretical investigation of key issues that need to be considered for integrating CT into K-12 science topics by identifying the synergies between CT and scientific expertise using a particular genre of computation: agent-based computation. We then present a critical review of the literature in educational computing, and propose a set of guidelines for designing learning environments on science topics that can jointly foster the development of computational thinking with scientific expertise. This is followed by the description of a learning environment that supports CT through modeling and simulation to help middle school students learn physics and biology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by discussing the results of a small study conducted in a middle school science classroom. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for future research on developing CT-based science learning environments.","authors":["Pratim Sengupta","John Siler Kinnebrew","Satabdi Basu","Gautam Biswas"],"meta":["June 2013Education and Information Technologies 18(2):351-380","DOI:10.1007/s10639-012-9240-x","Project: Computational Thinking and Modeling in K12 STEM"],"references":["313056846_Students'_transition_from_an_engineering_model_to_a_science_model_of_experimentation","281345564_Expert_and_Novice_Performance_in_Solving_Physics_Problems","274309848_Computational_Thinking","329654173_Changing_Minds_Computers_Learning_and_Literacy","303970457_Learning_Progressions_in_Science_An_Evidence-Based_Approach_to_Reform","285089562_Abstraction_Re-Presentation_and_Reflection_An_Interpretation_of_Experience_and_Piaget's_Approach","283625616_Establishing_the_norms_of_scientific_argumentation_in_classrooms","279933427_Learning-for-Use_A_Framework_for_the_Design_of_Technology-Supported_Inquiry_Activities","277374591_Lowering_the_barriers_to_programming","273107954_Explaining_Science_A_Cognitive_Approach"]}
