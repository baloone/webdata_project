{"id":"230609343_The_Instructor's_Guide_to_Real_Induction","abstract":"We introduce real induction, a proof technique analogous to mathematical\ninduction but applicable to statements indexed by an interval on the real line.\nMore generally we give an inductive principle applicable in any Dedekind\ncomplete linearly ordered set. Real and ordered induction is then applied to\ngive streamlined, conceptual proofs of basic results in honors calculus,\nelementary real analysis and topology.","authors":["Pete L.
