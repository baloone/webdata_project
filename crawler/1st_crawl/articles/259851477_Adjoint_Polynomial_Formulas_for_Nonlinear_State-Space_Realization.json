{"id":"259851477_Adjoint_Polynomial_Formulas_for_Nonlinear_State-Space_Realization","abstract":"This paper focuses on computational aspects of the realization of nonlinear multi-input multi-output systems. Instead of the algorithmic solutions, provided in earlier works, the explicit formulas are presented, which enable to compute the differentials of the state coordinates directly from the polynomial description of the nonlinear system. The solution is based on the concept of adjoint polynomials and requires a minimal amount of computations. The formulas are implemented in computer algebra system Mathematica and made available online via webMathematica tools.","authors":["Juri Belikov","Ü.
