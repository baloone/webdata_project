{"id":"268988147_The_Complexity_of_Finding_Effectors","abstract":"The NP-hard Effectors problem on directed graphs is motivated by applications in network mining, particularly concerning the analysis of (random) information-propagation processes. In the corresponding model the arcs carry probabilities and there is a probabilistic diffusion process activating nodes by neighboring activated nodes with probabilities as specified by the arcs. The point is to explain a given network activation state best possible using a minimum number of “effector nodes”; these are selected before the activation process starts.\nWe complement and extend previous work from the data mining community by a more thorough computational complexity analysis of Effectors, identifying both tractable and intractable cases. To this end, we also exploit a parameterization measuring the “degree of randomness” (the number of ‘really’ probabilistic arcs) which might prove useful for analyzing other probabilistic network diffusion problems.","authors":["Laurent Bulteau","Stefan Fafianie","Vincent Froese","Rolf Niedermeier"],"meta":["February 2017Theory of Computing Systems 60(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9670-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260837038_Parameterized_Inapproximability_of_Target_Set_Selection_and_Generalizations","260367438_Explaining_Snapshots_of_Network_Diffusions_Structural_and_Hardness_Results","257553299_Scalable_influence_maximization_for_independent_cascade_model_in_large-scale_social_networks","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","262399814_Constant_Thresholds_Can_Make_Target_Set_Selection_Tractable","258818395_Parameterized_Approximability_of_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_in_Networks","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","246106899_Eva_Tardos_Maximizing_the_spread_of_influence_through_a_social_network","222571771_Treewidth_Governs_the_Complexity_of_Target_Set_Selection"]}
