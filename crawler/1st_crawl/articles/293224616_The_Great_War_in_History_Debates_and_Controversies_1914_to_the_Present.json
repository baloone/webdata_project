{"id":"293224616_The_Great_War_in_History_Debates_and_Controversies_1914_to_the_Present","abstract":"A vast amount of literature has emerged on the First World War and its repercussions since the Armistice. Two leading historians therefore present this comparative analysis of the ways in which the history has been written and interpreted. Identifying three generations of historians, literary scholars, film directors and writers who have commented upon the war, they assess social and cultural interpretations as well as diplomatic and military studies, seen primarily through the eyes of French, German and British writers.
