{"id":"243470482_Cycles_of_even_length_in_graphs","abstract":"In this paper we solve a conjecture of P. Erdös by showing that if a graph Gn has n vertices and at least edges, then G contains a cycle C2l of length 2l for every integer . Apart from the value of the constant this result is best possible. It is obtained from a more general theorem which also yields corresponding results in the case where Gn has only cn(log n)α edges (α ≥ 1).","authors":["A. J. Bondy","M.
