{"id":"341347458_Primary_Level_Teachers_Training_in_Computer_Science_Experience_in_the_Argentine_Context","abstract":"This paper presents the design, development and preliminary results of the first specialization in Computer Science for the primary level, approved by the Ministry of Education of Santa Fe province. The “Higher Level Teaching Specialization in Didactics of Computing Science: Learning and Teaching Computational Thinking and Programming at the Primary Level” aims to empower teachers with this way of thinking and the potential of programming to include them in situated, interdisciplinary and non-exclusive teaching practices. The axes of the design of this training course are presented as well as the relevant characteristics of the students. In addition, results are provided that allow to account for the opinions of the participants regarding the dictation, the contents addressed and the inclusion in their practices. In this way, data is provided that makes it possible to review future training designs and implementations in an innovative field for primary level teachers.","authors":["Ana Casali","Natalia Monjelat","Patricia Silvana San Martin","Dante Zanarini"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-48325-8_25","In book: Computer Science – CACIC 2019 (pp.389-404)"],"references":["337494279_Formacion_docente_en_Ciencias_de_la_Computacion_experiencias_de_la_primera_Especializacion_para_el_nivel_Primario_de_la_Provincia_de_Santa_Fe","334850184_Teaching_and_Learning_Computer_Science_for_Primary_School_Teachers_an_Argentine_Experience","303668799_Computational_Thinking_for_All_Pedagogical_Approaches_to_Embedding_21st_Century_Problem_Solving_in_K-12_Classrooms","302946642_Que_son_las_tecnologias_para_la_inclusion_social","301648926_Programar_con_Scratch_en_contextos_educativos_Asimilar_directrices_o_co-construir_Tecnologias_para_la_Inclusion_Social","284139559_Computing_our_future_Computer_programming_and_coding_-_Priorities_school_curricula_and_initiatives_across_Europe","264626324_Perspectives_and_Visions_of_Computer_Science_Education_in_Primary_and_Secondary_K-12_Schools","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","29486913_Computer_Science_Unplugged_An_enrichment_and_extension_programme_for_primary-aged_children"]}
