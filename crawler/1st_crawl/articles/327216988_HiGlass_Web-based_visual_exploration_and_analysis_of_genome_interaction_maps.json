{"id":"327216988_HiGlass_Web-based_visual_exploration_and_analysis_of_genome_interaction_maps","abstract":"We present HiGlass, an open source visualization tool built on web technologies that provides a rich interface for rapid, multiplex, and multiscale navigation of 2D genomic maps alongside 1D genomic tracks, allowing users to combine various data types, synchronize multiple visualization modalities, and share fully customizable views with others. We demonstrate its utility in exploring different experimental conditions, comparing the results of analyses, and creating interactive snapshots to share with collaborators and the broader public. HiGlass is accessible online at http://higlass.io and is also available as a containerized application that can be run on any platform.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-018-1486-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","authors":["Peter Kerpedjiev","Nezar Abdennur","Fritz Lekschas","Chuck McCallum"],"meta":["August 2018Genome Biology 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13059-018-1486-1"],"references":["345744987_The_3D_Genome_Browser_a_web-based_browser_for_visualizing_3D_genome_organization_and_long-range_chromatin_interactions","329635436_GITAR_An_Open_Source_Tool_for_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Hi-C_Data","324956209_Emerging_Evidence_of_Chromosome_Folding_by_Loop_Extrusion","323002332_Juiceboxjs_Provides_a_Cloud-Based_Visualization_System_for_Hi-C_Data","320515830_Multiscale_3D_Genome_Rewiring_during_Mouse_Neural_Development","355201283_The_4D_Nucleome_Project","326423898_The_3D_Genome_Browser_a_web-based_browser_for_visualizing_3D_genome_organization_and_long-range_chromatin_interactions","323967376_Bladder_Cancer_4_Big_questions","322583476_A_pathway_for_mitotic_chromosome_formation","320329123_Cohesin_Loss_Eliminates_All_Loop_Domains"]}
