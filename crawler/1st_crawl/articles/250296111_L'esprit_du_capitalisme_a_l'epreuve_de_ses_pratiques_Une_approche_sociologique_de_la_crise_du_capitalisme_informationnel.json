{"id":"250296111_L'esprit_du_capitalisme_a_l'epreuve_de_ses_pratiques_Une_approche_sociologique_de_la_crise_du_capitalisme_informationnel","abstract":"While the crisis in employment and the generalisation of a condition of instability affecting the masses constitute a challenge for the sociologies of agency, the original and ever-present division between economics and sociology would seem to condemn the latter, and, more specifically, the sociology of work, to an oscillation between incantory denunciation and a role as dispenser of palliative social remedies. The sociological fields of work, organisation, and of the palliative social are totally cut off from the debates and strategies of alternative collective action, which are beginning to emerge within the economic field. Drawing on recent research dealing with cases of trade-union intervention in the management of firms, the author outlines the terms of what could constitute a sociology of levels of agency, linking the fields of the social and of the economic, and in which workers' autonomy would not be exclusively confined to its current place, in the margin between the prescribed rules and the actual functioning of operational units. Freed from such a marginal space, it could also involve an engagement in the tactical and strategic levels of decision-making whithin a firm. It would furthermore mean that, alongside the intervention of workers' trade-unions, the specific action of alternatives managers and experts should also be taken into account within the consultative bodies of firms.","authors":["Jean Lojkine"],"meta":["January 2002Actuel Marx 31(1)","DOI:10.3917/amx.031.0123"],"references":[]}
