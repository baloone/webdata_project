The study illustrates the method of building models and applying them to classify dermal cell images.\n\nResults\nThe deep learning models built here are tested on standard datasets, and the metric area under the curve of 99.77% was observed.\n\nConclusions\nA practitioner can use the model-driven architecture and quickly build the deep learning models to predict skin cancer.","authors":["Mohommad ALI Kadampur"],"meta":["January 2020Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 18(12)","DOI:10.1016/j.imu.2019.100282","Project: Research"],"references":["327539277_Skin_Cancer_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Systematic_Review_Preprint","325473733_Man_against_Machine_Diagnostic_performance_of_a_deep_learning_convolutional_neural_network_for_dermoscopic_melanoma_recognition_in_comparison_to_58_dermatologists","311805330_Automated_Melanoma_Recognition_in_Dermoscopy_Images_via_Very_Deep_Residual_Networks","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","260397232_Computer_Aided_Diagnostic_Support_System_for_Skin_Cancer_A_Review_of_Techniques_and_Algorithms","323062342_Classification_of_the_Clinical_Images_for_Benign_and_Malignant_Cutaneous_Tumors_Using_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm","322257103_Cancer_statistics_2018","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","299826832_Diagnostic_accuracy_of_dermoscopy","226241079_The_Limitations_of_Decision_Trees_and_Automatic_Learning_in_Real_World_Medical_Decision_Making"]}
