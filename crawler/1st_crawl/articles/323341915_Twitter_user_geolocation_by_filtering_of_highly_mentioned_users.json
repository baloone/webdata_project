{"id":"323341915_Twitter_user_geolocation_by_filtering_of_highly_mentioned_users","abstract":"Geolocated social media data provide a powerful source of information about places and regional human behavior. Because only a small amount of social media data have been geolocation-annotated, inference techniques play a substantial role to increase the volume of annotated data. Conventional research in this area has been based on the text content of posts from a given user or the social network of the user, with some recent crossovers between the text- and network-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel approach to categorize highly-mentioned users (celebrities) into Local and Global types, and consequently use Local celebrities as location indicators. A label propagation algorithm is then used over the refined social network for geolocation inference. Finally, we propose a hybrid approach by merging a text-based method as a back-off strategy into our network-based approach. Empirical experiments over three standard Twitter benchmark data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art user geolocation methods.","authors":["Mohammad Ebrahimi","Elaheh ShafieiBavani","Raymond Wong","Fang Chen"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 69(1)","DOI:10.1002/asi.24011"],"references":["301404980_Hierarchical_Discriminative_Classification_for_Text-Based_Geolocation","265479236_Supervised_Text-based_Geolocation_Using_Language_Models_on_an_Adaptive_Grid","263263100_Earthquake_Twitter_as_a_Distributed_Sensor_System","262165231_Who_where_when_and_what_Discover_spatio-temporal_topics_for_Twitter_users","258247194_Geo-Located_Twitter_as_Proxy_for_Global_Mobility_Patterns","257213323_Where's_wally_A_classification_approach_to_Geolocating_users_based_on_their_social_ties","252609646_OMG_Earthquake_Can_Twitter_Improve_Earthquake_Response","221614898_You_are_where_you_Tweet_A_content-based_approach_to_geo-locating_Twitter_users","221589939_Determining_the_spatial_reader_scopes_of_news_sources_using_local_lexicons","221023292_Earthquake_Shakes_Twitter_Users_Real-Time_Event_Detection_by_Social_Sensors","221012865_Weakly-Supervised_Acquisition_of_Labeled_Class_Instances_using_Graph_Random_Walks","221012847_Twitter_Catches_The_Flu_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_using_Twitter","220873161_Simple_supervised_document_geolocation_with_geodesic_grids","220699259_New_Regularized_Algorithms_for_Transductive_Learning","220351268_Detecting_geographical_references_in_the_form_of_place_names_and_associated_spatial_natural_language","51127724_The_Use_of_Twitter_to_Track_Levels_of_Disease_Activity_and_Public_Concern_in_the_US_During_the_Influenza_A_H1N1_Pandemic","322587850_Continuous_Representation_of_Location_for_Geolocation_and_Lexical_Dialectology_using_Mixture_Density_Networks","318739607_A_Neural_Model_for_User_Geolocation_and_Lexical_Dialectology","312333755_Sentiment_analysis_during_Hurricane_Sandy_in_emergency_response","310821847_On_Local_Expert_Discovery_via_Geo-Located_Crowds_Queries_and_Candidates","309022017_Probabilistic_Local_Expert_Retrieval","307686633_Geocoding_textual_documents_through_the_usage_of_hierarchical_classifiers","306093593_pigeo_A_Python_Geotagging_Tool","301432392_Exploiting_Geo-Spatial_Preference_for_Personalized_Expert_Recommendation","301405397_Estimating_User_Location_in_Social_Media_with_Stacked_Denoising_Auto-encoders","283438041_Proceedings_of_the_2007_joint_conference_on_Empirical_Methods_in_Natural_Language_Processing_and_Computational_Natural_Language_Learning_EMNLP-CoNLL","279633474_Twitter_User_Geolocation_Using_a_Unified_Text_and_Network_Prediction_Model","278734235_Exploiting_Text_and_Network_Context_for_Geolocation_of_Social_Media_Users","270878467_Geolocation_Prediction_in_Social_Media_Data_by_Finding_Location_Indicative_Words","266658607_Who_is_the_barbecue_king_of_texas_a_geo-spatial_approach_to_finding_local_experts_on_twitter","265769661_Text-Based_Twitter_User_Geolocation_Prediction","262398094_Hierarchical_geographical_modeling_of_user_locations_from_social_media_posts","261988808_Geotagging_One_Hundred_Million_Twitter_Accounts_with_Total_Variation_Minimization","254464469_Towards_social_user_profiling_Unified_and_discriminative_influence_model_for_inferring_home_locations","236858479_Inferring_the_Origin_Locations_of_Tweets_with_Quantitative_Confidence","230556684_Discovering_Geographical_Topics_from_Twitter_Streams","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","221023074_Video_suggestion_and_discovery_for_youtube_Taking_random_walks_through_the_view_graph","221013279_A_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Geographic_Lexical_Variation","220605738_Inferring_the_Location_of_Twitter_Messages_Based_on_User_Relationships","214640678_What_Is_Twitter_a_Social_Network_or_a_News_Media"]}
