{"id":"289661370_A_cross-cultural_study_of_ICT_competency_attitude_and_satisfaction_of_Turkish_polish_and_Czech_university_students","abstract":"Due to various factors, countries begin to have different levels of information and communication technologies (ICT) and they have their own unique culture of ICT usage. This case appears interesting especially when we consider university students' proficiency, attitudes and satisfaction in use of ICT. The purpose of this study is to examine the similarities and differences of university students in Turkey, EU candidate, and in Poland and Czech Republic, new members of EU, in terms of their proficiency, attitudes and satisfaction in use of ICT. The data of this study, composed of open-and closed-ended questions, were collected from students studying at departments of social and computational sciences. Statistical analyses of data collected were performed by SPSS 17, statistical package program. Results showed that a) despite the fact that Turkish students use computer for a shorter time than Polish and Czech students, there is no statistically significant difference between them, b) in terms of attitudes toward computer and their satisfaction, there is no difference between students studying at social departments whereas there is a statistically significant difference between students studying at departments of computational sciences.","authors":["Serkan Dinçer","Yunis şahinkayası"],"meta":["October 2011Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology 10(4):31-38"],"references":["298192655_Ogretmen_yetistiren_kurumlardaki_ogrencilerinin_ogrenim_hayatlari_boyunca_bilgisayar_ogrenme_duzeylerinin_ve_bilgisayar_okuryazarliklarinin_incelenmesi","259633055_UNIVERSITE_OGRENCILERININ_BILGISAYAR_OKUR-YAZARLIK_DUZEYLERININ_BELIRLENMESI_KOCAELI_UNIVERSITESI_ORNEGI","248606860_Education_faculty_students'_preferred_learning_situation_about_computer_literacy","245507800_Assessing_Information_and_Communications_Technology_Literacy_for_Higher_Education","229311960_Students'_skills_and_practices_of_using_ICT_Results_of_a_national_assessment_in_Finland","288066914_Relationships_Among_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_and_Desirability_of_Learning_Computing_Skills","282979801_Teachers_instructional_material_utilization_competencies_in_secondary_schools_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa_professional_and_non-professional_teachers'_perspective","249798019_Learning_With_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments_A_Literature_Review_of_Computer_Self-Efficacy","241585243_Electronic_Collaborators_Learner-Centered_Technologies_for_Literacy_Apprenticeship_and_Discourse","240385135_Using_Instructional_Technology_in_Transformed_Learning_Environments_An_Evaluation_of_Project_CHILD"]}
