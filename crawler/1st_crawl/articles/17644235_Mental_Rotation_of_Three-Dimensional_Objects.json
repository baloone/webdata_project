{"id":"17644235_Mental_Rotation_of_Three-Dimensional_Objects","abstract":"The time required to recognize that two perspective drawings portray objects of the same three-dimensional shape is found\nto be (i) a linearly increasing function of the angular difference in the portrayed orientations of the two objects and (ii)\nno shorter for differences corresponding simply to a rigid rotation of one of the two-dimensional drawings in its own picture\nplane than for differences corresponding to a rotation of the three-dimensional object in depth.","authors":["Roger N.
