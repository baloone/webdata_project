{"id":"338515790_Multi-GPU_Multi-Node_Algorithms_for_Acceleration_of_Image_Reconstruction_in_3D_Electrical_Capacitance_Tomography_in_Heterogeneous_Distributed_System","abstract":"Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is one of non-invasive visualization techniques which can be used for industrial process monitoring. However, acquiring images trough 3D ECT often requires performing time consuming complex computations on large size matrices. Therefore, a new parallel approach for 3D ECT image reconstruction is proposed, which is based on application of multi-GPU, multi-node algorithms in heterogeneous distributed system. This solution allows to speed up the required data processing. Distributed measurement system with a new framework for parallel computing and a special plugin dedicated to ECT are presented in the paper. Computing system architecture and its main features are described. Both data distribution as well as transmission between the computing nodes are discussed. System performance was measured using LBP and the Landweber’s reconstruction algorithms which were implemented as a part of the ECT plugin. Application of the framework with a new network communication layer reduced data transfer times significantly and improved the overall system efficiency.","authors":["Michał Majchrowicz","Paweł Kapusta","Lidia Jackowska-Strumillo","Robert Banasiak"],"meta":["January 2020Sensors 20(2):391","DOI:10.3390/s20020391"],"references":["330583197_FPGA_Implementation_of_ECT_Digital_System_for_Imaging_Conductive_Materials","327893556_Acceleration_of_3D_ECT_image_reconstruction_in_heterogeneous_multi-GPU_multi-node_distributed_system","334692651_Electrical_Resistance_Tomography_Based_Sensing_Skin_with_Internal_Electrodes_for_Crack_Detection_in_Large_Structures_Preliminary_Results_Standard_Difference_Imaging_Study","331582136_Effective_algorithm_for_tomography_imaging_in_threedimensional_problems","328519752_Effective_ultrasound_and_radio_tomography_imaging_algorithm_for_three-dimensional_problems","327849853_Acceleration_of_Electrical_Capacitance_Volume_Tomography_Imaging_by_Fourier-Based_Sparse_Representations","326377374_Electrical_Resistance_Tomography_Based_Sensing_Skin_with_Internal_Electrodes_for_Detecting_Cracking_in_Large_Structures_Preliminary_Standard_Difference_Imaging_Study","319935444_ACCELERATION_OF_IMAGE_RECONSTRUCTION_PROCESS_IN_THE_ELECTRICAL_CAPACITANCE_TOMOGRAPHY_3D_IN_HETEROGENEOUS_MULTI-GPU_SYSTEM","319933761_TOPOLOGICAL_ALGORITHMS_TO_SOLVE_INVERSE_PROBLEM_IN_ELECTRICAL_TOMOGRAPHY","312096968_Computationally_Efficient_Data_and_Application_Driven_Color_Transforms_for_the_Compression_and_Enhancement_of_Images_and_Video"]}
