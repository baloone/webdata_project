{"id":"225449378_Fixed-Parameter_Approximation_Conceptual_Framework_and_Approximability_Results","abstract":"The notion of fixed-parameter approximation is introduced to investigate the approximability of optimization problems within\nthe framework of fixed-parameter computation. This work partially aims at enhancing the world of fixed-parameter computation\nin parallel with the conventional theory of computation that includes both exact and approximate computations. In particular,\nit is proved that fixed-parameter approximability is closely related to the approximation of small-cost solutions in polynomial\ntime. It is also demonstrated that many fixed-parameter intractable problems are not fixed-parameter approximable. On the\nother hand, fixed-parameter approximation appears to be a viable approach to solving some inapproximable yet important optimization\nproblems. For instance, all problems in the class MAX SNP admit fixed-parameter approximation schemes in time O(2\nO((1−ε/O(1))k)\np(n)) for any small ε>0.","authors":["Liming Cai","Xiuzhen Huang"],"meta":["September 2006Algorithmica 57(2):398-412","DOI:10.1007/s00453-008-9223-x","SourceDBLP"],"references":["267553084_On_the_Approximability_of_NP-complete_Optimization_Problems","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","299256330_Improved_parameterized_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650271_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","243768188_New_worst-case_results_for_the_bin-packing_problem","239279796_Information_Security_Practice_and_Experience_Second_International_Conference_ISPEC_2006_Hangzhou_China_April_11-14_2006_Proceedings","228057892_Optimization_approximation_and_complexity_classes","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
