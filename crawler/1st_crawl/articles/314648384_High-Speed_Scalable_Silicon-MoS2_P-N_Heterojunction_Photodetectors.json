{"id":"314648384_High-Speed_Scalable_Silicon-MoS2_P-N_Heterojunction_Photodetectors","abstract":"Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising material for ultrasensitive photodetector owing to its favourable band gap and high absorption coefficient. However, their commercial applications are limited by the lack of high quality p-n junction and large wafer scale fabrication process. A high speed Si/MoS2 p-n heterojunction photodetector with simple and CMOS compatible approach has been reported here. The large area MoS2 thin film on silicon platform has been synthesized by sulfurization of RF-sputtered MoO3 films. The fabricated molecular layers of MoS2 on silicon offers high responsivity up to 8.75 A/W (at 580 nm and 3 V bias) with ultra-fast response of 10 μsec (rise time). Transient measurements of Si/MoS2 heterojunction under the modulated light reveal that the devices can function up to 50 kHz. The Si/MoS2 heterojunction is found to be sensitive to broadband wavelengths ranging from visible to near-infrared light with maximum detectivity up to ≈1.4 × 1012 Jones (2 V bias). Reproducible low dark current and high responsivity from over 20 devices in the same wafer has been measured. Additionally, the MoS2/Si photodetectors exhibit excellent stability in ambient atmosphere.","authors":["Veerendra Dhyani","Samaresh Das"],"meta":["March 2017Scientific Reports 7(1):44243","DOI:10.1038/srep44243"],"references":["304623964_Novel_Colloidal_MoS2_Quantum_Dot_Heterojunctions_on_Silicon_Platforms_for_Multifunctional_Optoelectronic_Devices","304001804_Active_Control_of_Plasmon-Exciton_Coupling_in_MoS_2_-Ag_Hybrid_Nanostructures","309715236_Atomically_Thin_MoS2_A_New_Direct-Gap_Semiconductor","299518484_Photonics_and_optoelectronics_of_2D_semiconductor_transition_metal_dichalcogenides","297597367_Long_wavelength_optical_response_of_graphene-MoS2_heterojunction","297589052_P-Type_MoS2_and_n-Type_ZnO_Diode_and_Its_Performance_Enhancement_by_the_Piezophototronic_Effect","295103324_An_Experimental_Study_Role_of_Different_Ambient_on_Sulfurization_of_MoO3_into_MoS2","294277857_High_sensitivity_silicon_single_nanowire_junctionless_phototransistor","291328930_Transport_Properties_of_a_MoS2WSe2_Heterojunction_Transistor_and_Its_Potential_for_Application","289970629_In_Situ_Fabrication_of_Vertical_Multilayered_MoS2_Si_Homotype_Heterojunction_for_High-Speed_Visible-Near-Infrared_Photodetectors"]}
