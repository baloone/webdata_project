{"id":"272088691_Comparing_Methods_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis","abstract":"This work extends the set of works which deal with the popular problem of\nsentiment analysis in Twitter. It investigates the most popular document\n(\"tweet\") representation methods which feed sentiment evaluation mechanisms. In\nparticular, we study the bag-of-words, n-grams and n-gram graphs approaches and\nfor each of them we evaluate the performance of a lexicon-based and 7\nlearning-based classification algorithms (namely SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayesian\nNetworks, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees,\nFunctional Trees and C4.5) as well as their combinations, using a set of 4451\nmanually annotated tweets. The results demonstrate the superiority of\nlearning-based methods and in particular of n-gram graphs approaches for\npredicting the sentiment of tweets. They also show that the combinatory\napproach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15%\non the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of\npositive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases\nthe improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using\nOrthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001.","authors":["Dimosthenis Anagnostopoulos","Evangelos Psomakelis","Konstantinos Tserpes","Theodora Varvarigou"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.5220/0005075302250232","Conference: International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval","Project: Consensus"],"references":["262356434_Comparing_and_combining_sentiment_analysis_methods","260773845_Comparison_between_SVM_and_Logistic_Regression_Which_One_is_Better_to_Discriminate","248832100_Thumbs_Up_or_Thumbs_Down_Semantic_Orientation_Applied_to_Unsupervised_Classification_of_Reviews","229069144_Content_vs_Context_for_Sentiment_Analysis_a_Comparative_Analysis_over_Microblogs","307936026_Large-scale_sentiment_analysis_for_news_and_blogs","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","238688787_Learning_Distance_Functions_Algorithms_and_Applications","235656842_Estimating_Continuous_Distributions_in_Bayesian_Classifiers","228523135_Twitter_sentiment_classification_using_distant_supervision","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation"]}
