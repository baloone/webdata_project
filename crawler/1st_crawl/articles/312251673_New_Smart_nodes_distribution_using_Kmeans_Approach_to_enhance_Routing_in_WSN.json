{"id":"312251673_New_Smart_nodes_distribution_using_Kmeans_Approach_to_enhance_Routing_in_WSN","abstract":"Objectives: Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an advanced technology, applied to many fields of research. However, it still limited due to some drawbacks, the energy consumed is one of them, which presents a critical issue. So that, our objective in this paper is to decrease the energy consumed during communication and prolong the network lifetime in Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) protocol. Methods/Statistical analysis: The Kmeans method was been exploited for improving the energy consumed in the network during routing data, which permit extending the network lifetime. It aims at distributing the sensor nodes. Where, the gravity center is determined as an active node, considering the least distance to the center of gravity and respecting the multihop communication between Active nodes. Findings: Simulation results confirmed that our new improved protocol reduces significantly nodes energy, which improves the network lifetime. Application/Improvements: By introducing our enhanced version Kmeans GAF, we can improve localization systems.","authors":["Hanane Aznaoui","Said Raghay","Layla Aziz"],"meta":["December 2016Indian Journal of Science and Technology 9(46)","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2016/v9i46/106908"],"references":["318711315_IMKREC_Improved_k-means_Algorithm_Method_for_Reducing_Energy_Consumption_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","309643916_A_new_enhanced_version_of_VLEACH_protocol_using_a_smart_path_selection","300409646_A_comparative_study_of_routing_protocols_in_WSN","291013415_Improvements_in_LEACH_based_on_K-means_and_Gauss_algorithms","273513099_A_Novel_Scheme_to_Minimize_Hop_Count_for_GAF_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Two-Level_GAF","269930580_ROUTING_PROTOCOLS_FOR_WIRELESS_SENSOR_NETWORKS_CLASSIFICATIONS_AND_CHALLENGES","304371012_A_new_approach_based_on_a_genetic_algorithm_and_an_agent_cluster_head_to_optimize_energy_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","282936599_A_new_improved_algorithm_of_leach_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","265800371_Multi-hop_Topology_Control_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","251936817_A_improved_GAF_clustering_algorithm_for_three-dimensional_underwater_acoustic_networks"]}
