{"id":"320093882_Bio_Inspired_Routing_Algorithm_and_Efficient_Communications_within_IoT","abstract":"IoT does not stop integrating and connecting more complex objects with different architectures, resources and constraints. This is why the conventional communication architectures and protocols designed for the existing wireless networks become ineffective in the context of IoT. Indeed, IoT communications parameters and constraints must be taken into account by all the important mechanisms that intervene in the communication process, such as routing. This article surveys a number of proposed routing algorithms for efficient communications within wireless networks and IoT. Based on the limitations of these works, a novel routing algorithm, called EICAntS (Efficient IoT Communications based on Ant System), is proposed to improve the route selection mechanism by exploiting the advantages of an ant colony system. The evaluation results of EICAntS recorded an improvement in delay, throughput, lifetime and conservation of energy.","authors":["Sofiane Hamrioui","Pascal Lorenz"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Network 31(5):74-79","DOI:10.1109/MNET.2017.1600282","Project: IoT, e-sant√©, Smart cities"],"references":["305675495_EQ-AODV_Energy_and_QoS_supported_AODV_for_better_performance_in_WMSNs","300084006_Swarm_Intelligence_from_Natural_to_Artificial_Systems_Ant_Colony_Optimization","299132506_Content_centric_routing_in_IoT_networks_and_its_integration_in_RPL","298318568_Feature_Selection_for_Intrusion_Detection_System_Using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","279236213_An_efficient_traffic_regulation_mechanism_for_distributed_networks","276382050_Intelligent_Traffic_Information_System_Based_on_Integration_of_Internet_of_Things_and_Agent_Technology","259571354_Chapter_10_Incidence_of_the_Improvement_of_the_Interactions_between_MAC_and_Transport_Protocols_on_MANET_Performance","235405232_A_Routing_Protocol_Based_on_Energy_and_Link_Quality_for_Internet_of_Things_Applications","305424238_An_Ant_Colony_based_Routing_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network","285701546_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Present_State_and_Future_Prospects"]}
