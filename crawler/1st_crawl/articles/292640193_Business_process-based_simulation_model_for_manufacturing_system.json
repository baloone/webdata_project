{"id":"292640193_Business_process-based_simulation_model_for_manufacturing_system","abstract":"A business process-based object-oriented simulation modeling method was presented, which combined the merits of analysis semantic such as Petri net. A manufacturing system was divided into conception model, context model and semantic model. And the more detailed modeling description of these models was expounded. To describe the object-oriented process of the modeling method, a case study of a manufacturing system in agile manufacturing was carried out.","authors":["D. Wei","Yusen Jin","Z. Wang","E.-F.
