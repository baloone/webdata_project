The realization of the research was divided into two phases. The first phase consists of a systematic overview of the literature that has resulted in the identification of 16 global ranking systems. In the second phase, an empirical analysis of 10 active ranking systems which were selected based on the set criteria. The ranking systems are observed regarding their measurement focus. According to the results of empirical analysis, the research category indicators account\nfor 67.93% of the sum of the weight coefficients in the overall measurement system, followed by the reputation category indicators with 13.5% and the web performance category indicators with 9.37%. The most significant number of global ranking systems dominantly puts its focus in the context of measuring research performance\nas the crucial indicator of the quality and competitiveness of universities.","authors":["Nemanja LukiÄ‡","Pere Tumbas"],"meta":["September 2019Strategic Management 24(3):43-54","DOI:10.5937/StraMan1903043L","Project: Development of a University Business Process Reference Model as an Instrument of International Competitive Positioning"],"references":["323621622_Are_university_rankings_useful_to_improve_research_A_systematic_review","316534270_Scientific_publishing_and_global_university_rankings_How_well_are_top_publishing_universities_recognized","291162562_Asian_top_universities_in_six_world_university_ranking_systems","277609863_Measuring_university_quality","277351587_A_comparative_analysis_of_global_and_national_university_ranking_systems","331178864_The_power_of_human-Machine_collaboration_Artificial_intelligence_business_automation_and_the_smart_economy","310586821_A_critical_comparative_analysis_of_five_world_university_rankings","305662287_Correlation_among_top_100_universities_in_the_major_six_global_rankings_policy_implications","300407921_Is_measuring_the_knowledge_creation_of_universities_possible_A_review_of_university_rankings","284330470_Internationalization_of_Higher_Education_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Investigation_of_Its_Influence_on_University_Institution_Rankings"]}
