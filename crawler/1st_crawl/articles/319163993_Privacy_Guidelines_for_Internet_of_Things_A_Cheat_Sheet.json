{"id":"319163993_Privacy_Guidelines_for_Internet_of_Things_A_Cheat_Sheet","abstract":"This document presents 30 different privacy guidelines that can be used to both design and assess IoT applications and IoT middleware platforms. These guidelines can be broadly categorised into eight categories, namely, MINIMIZE ( ), HIDE ( ), SEPARATE ( ), AGGREGATE ( ), INFORM ( ), CONTROL ( ), ENFORCE ( ), DEMONSTRATE ( ). This document uses the following structure to introduce the each privacy guidelines. First, we describe the philosophy behind each guideline in general. Then, we present the questions that software architects need to think about when designing or assessing an IoT platform or application. The questions slightly vary depending on whether the architect is assessing a platform or an application.","authors":["Charith Perera"],"meta":["August 2017"],"references":["307967586_Privacy-by-Design_Framework_for_Assessing_Internet_of_Things_Applications_and_Platforms"]}
