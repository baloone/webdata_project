This study includes 11 categories: weight, glucose, blood pressure, lipids, food, water, exercise, sleep, stress, life pattern regularity, time with ~500 input and output elements. He collected more than 1 million \"clean\" data over 7 years.","authors":["Gerald C Hsu","Gerald Hsu"],"meta":["November 2021"],"references":[]}
