{"id":"334693396_Hyperstructure_generalizations_of_quasi-automata_induced_by_modelling_functions_and_signal_processing","abstract":"Inspired by some elements of signal processing and frequentely used modelling functions we construct hyperstructures of vectors of real functions and of linear differential operators. Then we show how these can be used as state or input sets of automata without output generalized into the hyperstructure context, and discuss their homogeneous and heterogeneous products.","authors":["Jan Chvalina","Michal Novák","Štěpán Křehlík"],"meta":["July 2019AIP Conference Proceedings 2116(1):310006","DOI:10.1063/1.5114313","Conference: CENTRAL EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON THERMOPHYSICS 2019 (CEST)"],"references":["318773023_Cartesian_composition_and_the_problem_of_generalizing_the_MAC_condition_to_quasi-multiautomata","276126926_On_Certain_Proximities_and_Preorderings_on_the_Transposition_Hypergroups_of_Linear_First-Order_Partial_Differential_Operators","275993318_General_actions_of_hyperstructures_and_some_applications","220338283_Hypercompositional_Structures_in_the_Theory_of_the_Languages_and_Automata","346674359_Digital_Signal_Filtering_Analysis_and_Restoration","268550108_Algebraic_Theory_of_Automata","267661462_Applications_of_Hyperstructure_Theory","257048329_Some_basic_properties_of_EL-hyperstructures","220543470_The_Cartesian_Composition_of_Automata"]}
