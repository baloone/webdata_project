{"id":"303524677_Geomorphological_features_of_the_archaeological_marine_area_of_Sinuessa_in_Campania_southern_Italy","abstract":"Submarine surveys carried out since the '90s along the coastland of Sinuessa allowed us to draw up a\ngeomorphological map with archaeological findings. Along the sea bottom, 650 m off and -7 m depth, a\nCampanian Ignimbrite bedrock was detected: dated ~39 kyr BP, its position is incompatible with the\ncurrent sea level. Towards the northern edge of the shoal, a depressed area with 24 cubic elements in\nconcrete was surveyed. These artefacts (pilae) are typical of Roman maritime structures widespread\nalong the southernmost Phlegrean coast. Beachrocks and accessory landforms at the same depth of\nbedrock suggest that this was emerging and attended by man in Roman times, even for activities related\nto port facilities. Submerged palaeo-channels, in alignment of current watercourses on the mainland,\ndissect the shoal. These channels were moulded in subaerial environment during WÃ¼rm glaciation,\nfollowing the tuff deposition, and then were drowned by sea-level rise. The northernmost channel, next\nto the pilae, likely allowed transit and manoeuvring of Roman ships. The discovery along the seabed of a\nlarge stump of lead anchor, hundreds of Roman amphorae and fragments, as well as of a depression of\nmillstone, confirm this finding. Probably the sinuous physiography favored the choice of this site for the\ndocking of Sinuessa, as sheltered from storms.","authors":["Micla Pennetta","Corrado Stanislao","Veronica D'Ambrosio","Fabio Marchese"],"meta":["May 2016Quaternary International 425:198-213","DOI:10.1016/j.quaint.2016.04.019","Project: Vertical ground movements of emerged and submerged coastland of Campania through surveys of geomorphological and geoarchaeological elements"],"references":["303836543_Studio_delle_caratteristiche_morfoevolutive_quaternarie_della_piana_del_Garigliano","301198131_Morpho-sedimentary_features_and_sediment_transport_model_of_the_submerged_beach_of_the_'Pineta_della_foce_del_Garigliano'_SCI_Site_Caserta_southern_Italy","312468611_Struttura_marginale_dell'Appennino_campano_reinterpretazioni_di_dati_di_antiche_ricerche_di_idrocarburi","309076356_Archaeological_Evidence_for_Eustatic_Sea_Level_Change_and_Earth_Movements_in_the_Western_Mediterranean_During_the_Last_2000_Years","308058989_Vulcanologia_e_petrologia_dei_Campi_Flegrei","307906820_Effects_of_anthropogenic_activities_in_a_Mediterranean_coastland_the_case_study_of_the_Falerno-Domitio_littoral_in_Campania_Tyrrhenian_Sea_southern_Italy","307149726_Struttura_marginale_tirrenica_dell'Appennino_campano_reinterpretazione_di_dati_di_antiche_ricerche_di_idrocarburi","303836589_Processes_and_distribution_of_beach_and_river_sands","303836299_I_rapporti_tra_la_piattaforma_carbonatica_campa-_no-lucana_e_la_piattaforma_abruzzese-campana_al_Monte_Massico_Caseria","303748413_Vulcanologia_e_petrologia_dei_Campi_Flegrei"]}
