{"id":"260110272_Citation_impact_analysis_of_top_ranked_computer_science_journals_and_their_rankings","abstract":"Citation based approaches, such as the impact factor and h-index, have been used to measure the influence or impact of journals for journal rankings. A survey of the related literature for different disciplines shows that the level of correlation between these citation based approaches is domain dependent. We analyze the correlation between the impact factors and h-indices of the top ranked computer science journals for five different subjects. Our results show that the correlation between these citation based approaches is very low. Since using a different approach can result in different journal rankings, we further combine the different results and then re-rank the journals using a combination method. These new ranking results can be used as a reference for researchers to choose their publication outlets.","authors":["Chih-Fong Tsai"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of Informetrics 8(2):318â€“328","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2014.01.002"],"references":["251574644_Using_the_h-index_to_measure_the_quality_of_journals_in_the_field_of_business_and_management","240699651_Evaluating_Journal_Quality_Is_the_H-Index_a_Better_Measure_Than_Impact_Factors","222398699_Ranking_forestry_journals_using_the_h-index","221055637_Evaluating_Score_Normalization_Methods_in_Data_Fusion","220435319_A_Google_Scholar_H-Index_for_Journals_An_Alternative_Metric_to_Measure_Journal_Impact_in_Economics_Business","220424849_Objective_quality_ranking_of_computing_journals","220365316_Comparative_Analysis_between_Impact_Factor_and_h-Index_for_Psychiatry_Journals","278655139_Re-ranking_of_High-Impact_AI_Journals_Based_on_H-Index","274446135_On_the_Publish-or-Perish_Policy","254033546_A_PCE-based_Dynamic_Backup-reservation_Wavelength_Assignment_scheme_for_WSONs","250303937_Comparative_Analysis_Between_Impact_Factor_and_h-Index_for_Reproduction_Biology_Journals","228108254_dentifying_and_evaluating_the_universe_of_outlets_for_information_systems_research_Ranking_the_journals","222418821_Automatic_ranking_of_retrieval_systems_using_fusion_data","220423170_Global_Perception_of_IS_Journals","45088833_Psychiatry_and_the_Hirsch_h-index_The_Relationship_Between_Journal_Impact_Factors_and_Accrued_Citations","27293314_On_Site_Global_Perceptions_of_is_Journals","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output","7380639_The_History_and_Meaning_of_the_Journal_Impact_Factor","2777777_Analyses_of_Multiple_Evidence_Combination"]}
