{"id":"300152882_Scalable_Clustering_of_Time_Series_with_U-Shapelets","abstract":"A recently introduced primitive for time series data mining, unsupervised shapelets (u-shapelets), has demonstrated significant potential for time series clustering. In contrast to approaches that consider the entire time series to compute pairwise similarities, the u-shapelets technique allows considering only relevant subsequences of time series. Moreover, u-shapelets allow us to bypass the apparent chicken-and-egg paradox of defining relevant with reference to the clustering itself. U-shapelets have several advantages over rival methods. First, they are defined even when the time series are of different lengths; for example, they allow clustering datasets containing a mixture of single heartbeats and multi-beat ECG recordings. Second, u-shapelets mitigate sensitivity to irrelevant data such as noise, spikes, dropouts, etc. Finally, u-shapelets demonstrated ability to provide additional insights into the data. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art algorithms for u-shapelets search are intractable and so their advantages have only been demonstrated on tiny datasets. We propose a simple approach to speed up a u-shapelet discovery by two orders of magnitude, without any significant loss in clustering quality.","authors":["Liudmila Ulanova","Nurjahan Begum","Eamonn Keogh"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974010.101","In book: Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (pp.900-908)"],"references":[]}
