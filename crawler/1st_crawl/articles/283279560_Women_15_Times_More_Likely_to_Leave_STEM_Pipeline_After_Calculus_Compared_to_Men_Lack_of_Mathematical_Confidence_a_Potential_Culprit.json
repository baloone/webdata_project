{"id":"283279560_Women_15_Times_More_Likely_to_Leave_STEM_Pipeline_After_Calculus_Compared_to_Men_Lack_of_Mathematical_Confidence_a_Potential_Culprit","abstract":"The substantial gender gap in the science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics (STEM) workforce can be traced back to the underrepresentation of\nwomen at various milestones in the career pathway. Calculus is a necessary step\nin this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing STEM\nfields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested\nin STEM and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking\nCalculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a STEM major or are dissuaded\nfrom STEM disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on\nmainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for\nacademic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman\nbeing dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for\na man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material\nwell enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women\nand men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find\nwomen start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence\nthan men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack\nof mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of\nwomen. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women\nin STEM at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that simply\nincreasing the retention of women starting in college calculus would almost\ndouble the number of women entering the STEM workforce.","authors":["Jessica Ellis Hagman","Bailey K.
