{"id":"305767107_Design_and_Experimental_Validation_Study_on_Direct_Power_Control_Applied_on_Active_Power_Filter","abstract":"This paper presents a simulation and experimental study on one of the most common control strategy, direct power control (DPC), for three phase shunt active power filter. The main aims of the proposed strategy are to minimize or eliminate the impacts of the unwanted harmonics, and compensate the reactive power derived by the non-linear loads. The simulation and the experimental results obtained in this study, demonstrate the effectiveness of the direct power control algorithm to eliminate the harmonic currents, ameliorate the active power quality and minimize the reactive energy effect which allowed us to affirm the strength of the proposed strategy.","authors":["Sabir Ouchen","Achour Betka","Sabrina Abdeddaim","Rabiaa Mechouma"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1109/IEPS.2016.7521872","Conference: 2016 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Energy and Power Systems (IEPS)At: Kiev Ukraine"],"references":["291967609_A_three-phase_shunt_active_power_filter_for_currents_harmonics_suppression_and_reactive_power_compensation","278620632_Improvement_of_PWM_Rectifier_Performances_Using_Direct_Power_Control_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Theory","270935277_Active_and_reactive_power_ripple_minimization_in_direct_power_control_of_matrix_converter-fed_DFIG","292238742_A_review_of_active_power_filters_for_power_quality_improvement","270996613_Step-by-step_design_and_tuning_of_VOC_control_loops_for_grid_connected_rectifiers","263085047_Modified_teaching_learning_algorithm_and_double_differential_evolution_algorithm_for_optimal_reactive_power_dispatch_problem_A_comparative_study","262841396_Indirect_current_controlled_shunt_active_power_filter_for_power_quality_improvement","260712838_TABLE-BASED_direct_power_control_for_three-level_neutral_point-clamped_pulse-width_modulated_rectifier","260708537_Real-time_implementation_of_adaptive_fuzzy_hysteresis-band_current_control_technique_for_shunt_active_power_filter","260082762_A_New_Quick_Response_and_High_Efficiency_Control_Strategy_for_the_Induction_Motor"]}
