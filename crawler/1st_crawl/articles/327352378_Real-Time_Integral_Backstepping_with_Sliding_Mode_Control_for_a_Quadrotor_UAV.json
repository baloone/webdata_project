{"id":"327352378_Real-Time_Integral_Backstepping_with_Sliding_Mode_Control_for_a_Quadrotor_UAV","abstract":"This paper presents a nonlinear control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) for trajectory tracking. The dynamical model is obtained by the Euler- Lagrange methodology. In this paper, the proposed control strategy is based on the integral backstepping technique with sliding mode control (SMC) for altitude and lateral motion. In addition, an inner loop control is used to stabilize the vehicle orientation. The implementation is applied to the Qball-X4 prototype of Quanser Inc. which has OptiTrackTM cameras to provide the vehicle lateral position and a sonar sensor gives the altitude measurement. The experimental test results illustrate the effectiveness on the quadrotor of the proposed control scheme.","authors":["M. Elena Antonio-Toledo","Edgar Sanchez","Alma Y. Alanis","J.A.
