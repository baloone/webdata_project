{"id":"341486191_Hardware_Man-in-the-Middle_Attacks_on_Smartphones","abstract":"With the democratization of smartphones, law enforcement agencies are increasingly faced with the necessity of extracting data from criminal devices. Several vulnerabilities can be exploited to extract these data, but they are usually quickly fixed by a software update as soon as they are discovered by the manufacturers. We propose a new hardware/protocol based attack targeting the data communication bus of a smartphone. This attack is more robust to countermeasures and allows to have real-time access to the data exchanged for further processing.","authors":["Mohamed Amine Khelif","Jordane Lorandel","Olivier Romain"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.17352/fst.000016"],"references":["336726401_Toward_a_Hardware_Man-in-the-Middle_Attack_on_PCIe_Bus_for_Smart_Data_Replay","335673323_A_Versatile_Emulator_of_MitM_for_the_identification_of_vulnerabilities_of_IoT_devices_a_case_of_study_smartphones","320734516_A_Survey_on_Smartphones_Security_Software_Vulnerabilities_Malware_and_Attacks","281784536_Mactans_Injecting_Malware_Into_iOS_Devices_via_Malicious_Chargers","221324326_Mining_Bluetooth_Attacks_in_Smart_Phones","292383554_Introduction_to_Hardware_Security_and_Trust","286824279_NFC_Attacks_Analysis_and_Survey","261121530_Realistic_eavesdropping_attacks_on_computer_displays_with_low-cost_and_mobile_receiver_system","258160776_Dangerous_Wi-Fi_access_point_Attacks_to_benign_smartphone_applications"]}
