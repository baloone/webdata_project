{"id":"281374146_An_Introduction_to_Control_Theory_Applications_with_Matlab","abstract":"This book presents a short yet thorough introduction to the concepts of Classic and Modern Control Theory and Design. \nThis book can serve as a companion manual to all undergraduate and postgraduate students who are taking a course in Control Theory and want to see examples of systems, implemented and solved in Matlab. Problems from Classic and Modern Control Theory are covered, like analysis of 1st and 2nd order systems, root locus techniques, controller design, pole placement, observer design, Simulink implementation of models and more. These subjects are engaged through numerous physical applications which we believe the readers will find intriguing.","authors":["Lazaros Moysis","Michail Tsiaousis","Nikolaos Charalampidis","Maria Eliadou"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.3926.8243","Edition: 1st"],"references":["267110545_Modeling_and_simulation_of_systems_using_MATLAB_and_Simulink","317415439_Modern_control_engineering","294524170_Getting_started_with_SNPs","268489788_Modern_control_engineering","268426388_Classical_Control_Theory_A_Course_in_the_Linear_Mathematics_of_Systems_and_Control","267394296_Differential_Equations_Dynamical_Systems_and_an_Introduction_to_Chaos","266731997_Introduction_to_MATLAB_7_for_engineers","266309950_Digital_control_systems","264960770_Modern_Control_Systems","259576761_Modern_Control_Systems_13th_Edition","239414833_Robust_flight_control_systems_-_A_parameter_space_design","251890649_Cascade_Control_of_the_PH_in_an_Anaerobic_Wastewater_Treatment_System","248559648_Handbook_of_Design_Manufacturing_and_Automation","246857588_Modern_Control_Design_with_Matlab_and_Simulink","245915870_Difference_Equations_An_Introduction_with_Applications"]}
