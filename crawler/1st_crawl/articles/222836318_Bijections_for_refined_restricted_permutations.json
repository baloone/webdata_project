{"id":"222836318_Bijections_for_refined_restricted_permutations","abstract":"We present a bijection between 321- and 132-avoiding permutations that preserves the number of fixed points and the number of excedances. This gives a simple combinatorial proof of recent results of Robertson et al. (Ann. Combin. 6 (2003) 427), and Elizalde (Proc. FPSAC 2003). We also show that our bijection preserves additional statistics, which extends the previous results.","authors":["Sergi Elizalde","Igor Pak"],"meta":["January 2003Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 105(2):207-219","DOI:10.1016/j.jcta.2003.10.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["225131967_Refined_Restricted_Permutations","2105017_Fixed_Points_and_Excedances_in_Restricted_Permutations","302174239_Longest_increasing_and_decreasing_subsequences_Canad","268492102_Ballot_sequences_and_restricted_permutations","265445639_Restricted_Permutations","258225334_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","246076812_Enumerative_combinatorics_Vol_I","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","226010969_Longest_Increasing_and_Decreasing_Subsequences","223146165_A_survey_of_Fine_numbers","222827587_Refined_Restricted_Involutions","222577967_Permutations_with_Restricted_Patterns_and_Dyck_Paths","222472671_Restricted_permutations","222460801_Generating_trees_and_the_Catalan_and_Schrder_numbers","222420990_Enumeration_of_permutations_containing_a_prescribed_number_of_occurences_of_a_pattern_of_length_three","222013350_On_the_diagram_of_132-avoiding_permutations","216546039_Enumerative_Combinatorics","2924934_Longest_Increasing_Subsequences_in_Pattern-Restricted_Permutations"]}
