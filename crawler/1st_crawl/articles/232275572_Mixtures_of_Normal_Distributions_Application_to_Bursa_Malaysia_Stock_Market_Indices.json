{"id":"232275572_Mixtures_of_Normal_Distributions_Application_to_Bursa_Malaysia_Stock_Market_Indices","abstract":"In this paper, mixture of Normal distributions is proposed to accommodate the non-normality and asymmetry characteristics of financial time series data as found in the distribution of monthly rates of returns for three indices of Bursa Malaysia Index Series namely the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Composite Index (FBM KLCI), the Finance Index and the Industrial Index from July 1990 until July 2010. We also present the most commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) via the EM algorithm to fit the two-component mixture of Normal distribution using data sets on logarithmic stock returns of Bursa Malaysia indices.","authors":["Zetty Ain Kamaruzzaman","Zaidi Isa","Mohd Tahir Ismail"],"meta":["January 2012World Applied Sciences Journal 16(6):781-790"],"references":["313201241_A_compound_events_model_for_security_prices","265369338_Mixture_Models_Theory_Geometry_and_Applications","254331676_A_Comparison_of_Two_Methods_of_Analysis_of_Mixtures_of_Nomnal_Distributions1","254197764_An_introduction_to_mixture_models","246782707_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data","222300955_Tests_for_normal_mixtures_based_on_the_empirical_characteristic_function","24102526_A_Comparison_of_Stable_and_Student_Distribution_as_Statistical_Models_for_Stock_Prices","24102448_The_Distribution_of_Share_Price_Changes","4813106_A_Subordinated_Stochastic_Process_Model_With_Finite_Variance_for_Security_Prices","4767377_Models_of_Stock_Returns--A_Comparison"]}
