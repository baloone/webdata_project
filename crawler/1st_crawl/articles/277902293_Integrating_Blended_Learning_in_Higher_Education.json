Learning styles and preferences vary; and considering these differences while planning lessons ensures the effective delivery of learning. Besides, studentsâ€™ nomophobia has put more pressure on how instructors plan their lessons. For these reasons, instructors in the higher education sector have been thinking of ways to make learning more interactive and motivating.
