{"id":"283681423_Approach_to_Microstructure-Behavior_Relationships_for_Ceramic_Matrix_Composites_Reinforced_by_Continuous_Fibers","abstract":"Woven SiC-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are promising materials for several systems running at high temperatures. They provide excellent examples of microstructure–behavior relationships in long fiber-reinforced brittle matrices. Minicomposite test specimens represent an appropriate length scale for investigation of multidirectionally reinforced CMCs like the 2D woven SiC SiC and C SiC. The chapter discusses microstructure–behavior relationships for 2D woven composites. It focuses on matrix damage by multiple cracking, ultimate fracture, delayed fracture at high temperatures, nonlinear stress–strain behavior, influence of constituent properties, and stochastic features induced by flaw populations. Damage evolution and ultimate failure are modeled on the basis of micromechanics and fracture probabilities.","authors":["Jacques Luc Lamon"],"meta":["January 2015MATEC Web of Conferences 29:00007","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/20152900007"],"references":["284046273_Multi-fissuration_de_composites_SiCSiC","267013774_The_Statistics_of_Extremes","258696346_Flaw_strength_distributions_and_statistical_parameters_for_ceramic_fibers_The_normal_distribution","254223209_Fibre-Matrix_Interphases_and_Interfaces_in_Ceramic_Matrix_Composites_Processed_by_CVI","252858090_A_Statistical_Theory_for_the_Fracture_of_Brittle_Structures_Subjected_to_Non-Uniform_Polyaxial_Stresses","251506207_Virtual_testing_applied_to_transverse_multiple_cracking_of_tows_in_woven_ceramic_composites","248453534_Probabilistic-statistical_approach_to_matrix_damage_and_stress-Strain_behavior_of_2-D_woven_SiCSiC_ceramic_matrix_composites","248407202_Micromechanics_Based_Model_of_Fatigue_Oxidation_for_Ceramic_Matrix_Composites","248406899_A_Micromechanics-Based_Approach_to_the_Mechanical_Behavior_of_Brittle-Matrix_Composites","248406651_Probabilistic_Simulation_of_the_Non-Linear_Mechanical_Behavior_of_a_Woven_SiCSiC_Composite"]}
