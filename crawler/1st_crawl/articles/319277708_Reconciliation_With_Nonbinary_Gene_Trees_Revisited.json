{"id":"319277708_Reconciliation_With_Nonbinary_Gene_Trees_Revisited","abstract":"By reconciling the phylogenetic tree of a gene family with the corresponding species tree, it is possible to infer lineage-specific duplications and losses with high confidence and hence to annotate orthologs and paralogs. The currently available reconciliation methods for nonbinary gene trees are computationally expensive for genome-scale applications. We present four O(&verbar;G&verbar;+&verbar;S&verbar;) algorithms to reconcile an arbitrary gene tree G with a binary species tree S in the duplication, loss, duploss (also known as mutation), and deep coalescence cost models, where &verbar;Â· &verbar; denotes the number of nodes in a tree. The improvement is achieved through two innovations: a linear-time computation of compressed child-image subtrees and efficient reconstruction of irreducible duplication histories. Our technique for child-image subtree compression also results in an order of magnitude speedup in runtime for the dynamic programming and Wagner parsimony--based methods for tree reconciliation in the affine cost model.","authors":["Yu Zheng","Louxin Zhang"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of the ACM 64(4):1-28","DOI:10.1145/3088512"],"references":["243775711_Methods_for_Computing_Wagner_Trees","232971326_Genome-scale_coestimation_of_species_and_gene_trees","230827164_Inferring_duplications_losses_transfers_and_incomplete_lineage_sorting_with_nonbinary_species_trees","226729047_Sankoff_D_and_P_Rousseau_Locating_the_vertices_of_a_Steiner_tree_in_arbitrary_space_Math_Prog","225293579_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Reconciliation_Problem_with_Gene_Duplication_Horizontal_Transfer_and_Loss","220617428_An_Efficient_Parallel_Biconnectivity_Algorithm","220148747_DLS-trees_A_model_of_evolutionary_scenarios","200029020_MRBAYES_Bayesian_inference_of_phylogenetic_trees","51754768_Algorithms_for_MDC-Based_Multi-Locus_Phylogeny_Inference_Beyond_Rooted_Binary_Gene_Trees_on_Single_Alleles","51665291_Models_algorithms_and_programs_for_phylogeny_reconciliation","51235437_Computational_methods_for_Gene_Orthology_inference","47755754_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_the_Multiple_Gene_Duplication_Problems","31137863_Gene_Trees_in_Species_Trees","26808058_Species_Tree_Inference_by_Minimizing_Deep_Coalescences","12220590_NOTUNG_A_Program_for_Dating_Gene_Duplications_and_Optimizing_Gene_Family_Trees","10757728_Kellis_M_Patterson_N_Endrizzi_M_Birren_B_Lander_ES_Sequencing_and_comparison_of_yeast_species_to_identify_genes_and_regulatory_elements_Nature_423_241-254","8018874_Tree_pattern_matching_in_phylogenetic_trees_Automatic_search_for_orthologs_or_paralogs_in_homologous_gene_sequence_databases","7183102_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","6784706_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction_of_Orthology_Paralogy_and_Conserved_Synteny_for_Dog_and_Human","6666668_Widespread_Discordance_of_Gene_Trees_with_Species_Tree_in_Drosophila_Evidence_for_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting","6515504_Inferring_angiosperm_phylogeny_from_EST_data_with_widespread_gene_duplication","324465152_A_Dual_of_Dilworth's_Decomposition_Theorem","312975699_Reconciling_phylogenetic_trees","290013218_A_hybrid_micro-macroevolutionary_approach_to_gene_tree_reconstruction","279421496_Large-Scale_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_and_Phylogeny_Estimation","272593588_Fitting_the_Gene_Lineage_into_its_Species_Lineage_a_Parsimony_Strategy_Illustrated_by_Cladograms_Constructed_from_Globin_Sequences","267662712_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Reconciliation_of_Non-binary_Gene_Tree_and_Binary_Species_Tree","267132367_A_Dual_of_Dilworth's_Decomposition_Theorem","258147997_Large-Scale_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_and_Tree_Estimation_Using_SATe","256197342_An_Optimal_Reconciliation_Algorithm_for_Gene_Trees_with_Polytomies","255692171_How_old_is_my_gene","244427198_Fitting_the_Gene_Lineage_into_its_species_lineage_a_parsimony_strategy_illustrated_by_cladograms_constructed_from_globin_sequences","238673034_Locating_the_vertices_of_a_Steiner_tree_in_an_arbitrary_metric_space","229755916_Reconciling_Phylogenetic_Trees","228057866_On_Finding_Lowest_Common_Ancestors_Simplification_and_Parallelization","226399283_Ancestral_Reconstruction_by_Asymmetric_Wagner_Parsimony_over_Continuous_Characters_and_Squared_Parsimony_over_Distributions","225226263_Reconciling_Gene_Trees_with_Apparent_Polytomies","225069470_Simultaneous_Identification_of_Duplications_Losses_and_Lateral_Gene_Transfers","221530653_New_Perspectives_on_Gene_Family_Evolution_Losses_in_Reconciliation_and_a_Link_with_Supertrees","220432238_The_Gene_Evolution_Model_and_Computing_Its_Associated_Probabilities","200101672_Inferring_Phylogenies","51131080_From_Gene_Trees_to_Species_Trees_II_Species_Tree_Inference_by_Minimizing_Deep_Coalescence_Events","17720607_Distinguishing_Homologous_from_Analogous_Proteins","13849167_A_Genomic_Perspective_on_Protein_Families","11525084_Automated_ortholog_inference_from_phylogenetic_trees_and_calculation_of_orthology_reliability","6035776_Natural_history_and_evolutionary_principles_of_gene_duplication_in_fungi","2276435_On_a_Mirkin-Muchnik-Smith_Conjecture_for_Comparing_Molecular_Phylogenies"]}
