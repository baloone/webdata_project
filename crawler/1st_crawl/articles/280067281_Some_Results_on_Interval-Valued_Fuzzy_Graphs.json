{"id":"280067281_Some_Results_on_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"Theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized in applications of computer science especially in research area of computer science such as data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing and networking. An interval-valued fuzzy graph can be obtained from two given interval-valued fuzzy graphs\nusing Cartesian product and composition. In this paper, we introduced the degree of an edge and total degree of an edge. Likewise, we established the degree of an edge in interval-valued fuzzy graphs formed by these operations in terms of the degree of edges in the given interval-valued fuzzy graphs in some particular cases.","authors":["Madhumangal Pal","Sovan Samanta","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["January 2015","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["312468225_Concept_of_fuzzy_planar_graphs","280087257_Isomorphism_on_Interval_-_valued_fuzzy_graphs","280087104_Some_Operations_on_Vague_Graphs","280067370_Isomorphism_on_vague_graphs","280066171_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs","264994797_Complement_of_a_fuzzy_graph"]}
