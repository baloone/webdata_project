{"id":"349539293_Interactive_Sequential_Basket_Recommendation_by_Learning_Basket_Couplings_and_PositiveNegative_Feedback","abstract":"Sequential recommendation , such as next-basket recommender systems (NBRS), which model users’ sequential behaviors and the relevant context/session, has recently attracted much attention from the research community. Existing session-based NBRS involve session representation and inter-basket relations but ignore their hybrid couplings with the intra-basket items, often producing irrelevant or similar items in the next basket. In addition, they do not predict next-baskets (more than one next basket recommended). Interactive recommendation further involves user feedback on the recommended basket. The existing work on next-item recommendation involves positive feedback on selected items but ignores negative feedback on unselected ones. Here, we introduce a new setting— interactive sequential basket recommendation , which iteratively predicts next baskets by learning the intra-/inter-basket couplings between items and both positive and negative user feedback on recommended baskets. A hierarchical attentive encoder-decoder model (HAEM) continuously recommends next baskets one after another during sequential interactions with users after analyzing the item relations both within a basket and between adjacent sequential baskets (i.e., intra-/inter-basket couplings) and incorporating the user selection and unselection (i.e., positive/negative) feedback on the recommended baskets to refine NBRS. HAEM comprises a basket encoder and a sequence decoder to model intra-/inter-basket couplings and a prediction decoder to sequentially predict next-baskets by interactive feedback-based refinement. Empirical analysis shows that HAEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for NBRS and session-based recommenders for accurate and novel recommendation. We also show the effect of continuously refining sequential basket recommendation by including unselection feedback during interactive recommendation.","authors":["Wei Wang","Longbing Cao"],"meta":["February 2021ACM Transactions on Information Systems 39(3):1-26","DOI:10.1145/3444368"],"references":["326502589_Recommendations_with_Negative_Feedback_via_Pairwise_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","324055051_Evaluation_of_Session-based_Recommendation_Algorithms","323392518_Sequence-Aware_Recommender_Systems","322126543_Perceiving_the_Next_Choice_with_Comprehensive_Transaction_Embeddings_for_Online_Recommendation","321095740_A_Hierarchical_Contextual_Attention-based_GRU_Network_for_Sequential_Recommendation","319285112_Personalizing_Session-based_Recommendations_with_Hierarchical_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","318829845_Diversifying_Personalized_Recommendation_with_User-session_Context","318829508_DeepFM_A_Factorization-Machine_based_Neural_Network_for_CTR_Prediction","317393746_Improving_the_Quality_of_Recommendations_for_Users_and_Items_in_the_Tail_of_Distribution","312311910_Learning_Informative_Priors_from_Heterogeneous_Domains_to_Improve_Recommendation_in_Cold-Start_User_Domains","305676913_Non-IID_Recommender_Systems_A_Review_and_Framework_of_Recommendation_Paradigm_Shifting","297750727_E-NSP_Efficient_negative_sequential_pattern_mining","287206492_Modeling_Retail_Transaction_Data_for_Personalized_Shopping_Recommendation","283680994_Nonoccurring_Behavior_Analytics_A_New_Area","276386350_Formalization_and_Verification_of_Group_Behavior_Interactions","271924131_Increasing_recommended_effectiveness_with_markov_chains_and_purchase_intervals","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","262275934_Effective_Next-Items_Recommendation_via_Personalized_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","254464343_Playlist_prediction_via_metric_embedding","224242244_Coupled_Behavior_Analysis_with_Applications","332066719_Negative_Sequence_Analysis_A_Review","320884771_Neural_Attentive_Session-based_Recommendation","318830051_Attentional_Factorization_Machines_Learning_the_Weight_of_Feature_Interactions_via_Attention_Networks","318764240_Neural_Factorization_Machines_for_Sparse_Predictive_Analytics","313458568_Context-Aware_Sequential_Recommendation","313237232_Multi-Behavioral_Sequential_Prediction_with_Recurrent_Log-Bilinear_Model","305082586_A_Dynamic_Recurrent_Model_for_Next_Basket_Recommendation","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","272392920_A_Case-Based_Recommendation_Approach_for_Market_Basket_Data","265909033_Coupling_learning_of_complex_interactions","264293856_Combined_mining_Analyzing_object_and_pattern_relations_for_discovering_and_constructing_complex_yet_actionable_patterns","262213660_Personalized_next-song_recommendation_in_online_karaokes","262163766_Interactive_collaborative_filtering","261153487_Coupled_clustering_ensemble_Incorporating_coupling_relationships_both_between_base_clusterings_and_objects","222533843_Classification-based_collaborative_filtering_using_market_basket_data","221300507_Fast_context-aware_recommendations_with_factorization_machines","221023671_Factorizing_personalized_Markov_chains_for_next-basket_recommendation","220766482_Factorization_Machines","220314321_Cao_L_In-depth_Behavior_Understanding_and_Use_the_Behavior_Informatics_Approach_Information_Science_18017_3067-3085"]}
