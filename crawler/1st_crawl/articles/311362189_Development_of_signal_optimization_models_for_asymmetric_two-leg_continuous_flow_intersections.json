{"id":"311362189_Development_of_signal_optimization_models_for_asymmetric_two-leg_continuous_flow_intersections","abstract":"Despite extensive studies have been reported to address the operational issues of full Continuous Flow Intersection (CFI) in the literature, the asymmetric two-leg CFI, which is more applicable in practice, has not received adequate attentions yet. To satisfy such need, this study develops two signal optimization models for asymmetric CFI based on its unique geometric features. The first proposed model, following a two-step procedure, determines the cycle length, phase design and sequence, and green split in the first step and optimizes intersection offset in the second step. To benefit both intersectionsâ€™ capacity maximization and signal progression design by optimizing phase plan and sequence, the second proposed model takes the Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming (MILP) technique to concurrently optimize all signal control variables. With extensive case studies on a field site in Maryland, the simulation results prove that the proposed models can effectively provide signal progression to critical path-flows and prevent the potential queue spillover on the short turning bays/links. Further comparisons between the two proposed models reveal that the second model is more flexible in designing phase plan but the first model performs better in reducing link queue length.","authors":["Xianfeng Yang","Yao Cheng"],"meta":["January 2017Transportation Research Part C Emerging Technologies 74:306-326","DOI:10.1016/j.trc.2016.11.021"],"references":["309224425_Operational_Analysis_and_Signal_Design_for_Asymmetric_Two-Leg_Continuous-Flow_Intersection","279936619_Traffic_signal_optimization_program_for_oversaturated_conditions_genetic_algorithm_approach","275854809_Coordinated_Optimization_Model_for_Signal_Timings_of_Full_Continuous_Flow_Intersections","274264280_A_continuous-flow-intersection-lite_design_and_traffic_control_for_oversaturated_bottleneck_intersections","270732713_Development_of_Planning-Stage_Models_for_Analyzing_Continuous_Flow_Intersections","260208410_Development_of_a_Signal_Optimization_Model_for_Diverging_Diamond_Interchange","245562933_VisSim-Based_Genetic_Algorithm_Optimization_of_Signal_Timings","245557796_MULTIBAND-96_A_Program_for_Variable-Bandwidth_Progression_Optimization_of_Multiarterial_Traffic_Networks","245306610_System_Partition_Technique_to_Improve_Signal_Coordination_and_Traffic_Progression","239438787_Design_and_Operational_Performance_of_Crossover_Displaced_Left-Turn_Intersections","221526934_Application_of_Stochastic_Optimization_Method_for_an_Urban_Corridor","5175552_MAXBAND_A_Program_for_Setting_Signals_on_Arteries_and_Triangular_Networks","297489211_Analyzing_system_travel_time_in_arterial_corridors_with_unconventional_designs_using_microscopic_simulation","279906370_Hybrid_genetic_algorithm_to_optimize_signal_phasing_and_timing","279904932_MAXBAND-86_Program_for_optimizing_left-turn_phase_sequence_in_multiarterial_closed_networks","272350174_A_Multi-path_progression_model_for_synchronization_of_arterial_traffic_signals","254670710_Unconventional_Intersection_Designs_for_Improving_Through_Traffic_Along_the_Arterial_Road","245559607_Travel_Time_Comparisons_Between_Seven_Unconventional_Arterial_Intersection_Designs","245481069_Minimizing_delay_at_a_signalized_intersection_for_time-invariant_demand_rates","242930740_Synchronizing_Traffic_Signals_for_Maximal_Bandwidth","227427068_Increasing_the_capacity_of_signalized_intersections_with_separate_left_turn_phases","223487952_Arterial-based_control_of_traffic_flow_in_urban_grid_networks","38009280_The_Synchronization_of_Traffic_Signals_by_Mixed-Integer_Linear_Programming","23527721_Lane-based_optimization_of_signal_timings_for_isolated_junctions","23527289_A_multi-band_approach_to_arterial_traffic_signal_optimization"]}
