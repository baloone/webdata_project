{"id":"335147329_A_Novel_Approach_to_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Its_Application_in_Decision_Support_System","abstract":"The basic idea underneath the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set is very constructive in decision making, since it considers how to exploit an extra intuitionistic fuzzy input from the director to make up for any distortion in the information provided by the evaluation experts, which is redefined and clarified by F. Feng. In this paper, we introduced a method to solve decision making problems using an adjustable weighted soft discernibility matrix in a generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set. We define the threshold functions like mid-threshold, top-bottom-threshold, bottom-bottom-threshold, top-top-threshold, med-threshold function and their level soft sets of the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set. After, we proposed two algorithms based on threshold functions, a weighted soft discernibility matrix and a generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set and also to show the supremacy of the given methods we illustrate a descriptive example using a weighted soft discernibility matrix in the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set. Results indicate that the proposed method is more effective and generalized over all existing methods of the fuzzy soft set.","authors":["Muhammad JABIR Khan","Poom Kumam","Peide Liu","Wiyada Kumam"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7080742","Project: decision making"],"references":["341965530_Generalized_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_sets_with_applications_in_decision-making","339128841_Intuitionistic_Neutrosophic_Soft_Set","333559318_Intuitionistic_Neutrosophic_Soft_Set","331906686_Generalized_Picture_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Their_Application_in_Decision_Support_Systems","331475363_Solution_of_multi-criteria_group_decision_making_problem_based_on_picture_linguistic_informations","331162744_Application_of_Exponential_Jensen_Picture_Fuzzy_Divergence_Measure_in_Multi-Criteria_Group_Decision_Making","327816372_Novel_Concept_of_Cubic_Picture_Fuzzy_Sets","320571956_A_Method_for_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_in_Decision-Making_Based_on_an_Ideal_Solution","326848879_Another_View_on_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Related_Multiattribute_Decision_Making_Methods","326305065_Different_Approaches_to_Multi-Criteria_Group_Decision_Making_Problems_for_Picture_Fuzzy_Environment"]}
