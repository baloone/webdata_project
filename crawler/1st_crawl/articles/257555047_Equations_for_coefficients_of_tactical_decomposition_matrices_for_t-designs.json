{"id":"257555047_Equations_for_coefficients_of_tactical_decomposition_matrices_for_t-designs","abstract":"Equations for coefficients of tactical decomposition matrices for $2$-designs are well-known and they have been used for constructions of many examples of $2$-designs. In this paper, we generalize these equations and propose an explicit equation system for coefficients of tactical decomposition matrices for \\mbox{$t$-$(v,k,\\lambda_t)$} designs, for any integer value of $t$.","authors":["Vedran Krƒçadinac","Anamari Nakic","Mario Pavcevic"],"meta":["August 2014Designs Codes and Cryptography 72(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-012-9779-y"],"references":["265456113_Finite_Geometries","246355283_CRC_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Designs","232327413_t-Designs_on_hypergraphs","229078708_t-designs_t3","227705108_The_Kramer-Mesner_Method_With_Tactical_Decompositions_Some_New_Unitals_on_65_Points","220078730_Construction_of_a_New_Symmetric_Block_Design_for_78_22_6_with_the_Help_of_Tactical_Decompositions"]}
