{"id":"355339565_Computing_Bayes-Nash_Equilibria_in_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Verification","abstract":"We present a new algorithm for computing pure-strategy ε-Bayes-Nash equilibria (ε-BNEs) in combinatorial auctions. The main innovation of our algorithm is to separate the algorithm’s search phase (for finding the ε-BNE) from the verification phase (for computing the ε). Using this approach, we obtain an algorithm that is both very fast and provides theoretical guarantees on the ε it finds. Our main contribution is a verification method which, surprisingly, allows us to upper bound the ε across the whole continuous value space without making assumptions about the mechanism. Using our algorithm, we can now compute ε-BNEs in multi-minded domains that are significantly more complex than what was previously possible to solve. We release our code under an open-source license to enable researchers to perform algorithmic analyses of auctions, to enable bidders to analyze different strategies, and many other applications.","authors":["Vitor Bosshard","Benedikt Bünz","Benjamin Lubin","Sven Seuken"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 69","DOI:10.1613/jair.1.11525"],"references":["267003224_Adaptive_Moving_Mesh_Methods","266095686_Gambit_Software_Tools_for_Game_Theory","247926036_The_Lovely_but_Lonely_Vickrey_Auction","228911819_Core-Selecting_Auctions_with_Incomplete_Information","228319676_On_The_Impossibility_of_Core-Selecting_Auctions","227389481_Putting_Auction_Theory_To_Work","221455402_Stochastic_search_methods_for_Nash_equilibrium_approximation_in_simulation-based_games","24058952_Core-selecting_package_auctions","4898216_Rationalizability_Learning_and_Equilibrium_in_Games_With_Strategic_Complementarities","348804547_The_Cost_of_Simple_Bidding_in_Combinatorial_Auctions","345430611_The_return_function_A_new_computable_perspective_on_Bayesian-Nash_equilibria","333939913_Estimating_Approximate_Incentive_Compatibility","326202890_Non-decreasing_Payment_Rules_for_Combinatorial_Auctions","325867167_Designing_Core-selecting_Payment_Rules_A_Computational_Search_Approach","318830250_Computing_Bayes-Nash_Equilibria_in_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Continuous_Value_and_Action_Spaces","313189460_Direct_search_solution_of_numerical_and_statistical_problems","313099002_Bidding_languages_for_combinatorial_auctions","299954924_New_Core-Selecting_Payment_Rules_with_Better_Fairness_and_Incentive_Properties","276880125_Compact_Bid_Languages_and_Core_Pricing_in_Large_Multi-item_Auctions","273698329_Counter_Speculation_Auctions_and_Competitive_Sealed_Tenders","243653793_Iterative_solution_of_games_by_fictitious_play","237796328_Quadratic_Core-Selecting_Payment_Rules_for_Combinatorial_Auctions","236221580_Multipart_Pricing_of_Public_Goods","234831331_Numerical_Recipes_3rd_Edition_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing","232435843_Computing_pure_Bayesian_Nash_equilibria_in_games_with_finite_actions_and_continuous_types","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","227710272_Games_With_Discontinuous_Payoffs_A_Strengthening_of_Reny's_Existence_Theorem","227501815_Existence_of_Equilibrium_in_Single_and_Double_Private_Value_Auctions1","227446412_Some_Guidelines_and_Guarantees_for_Common_Random_Numbers","222502121_Consistency_and_Cautious_Fictitious_Play","220459917_An_Algorithm_with_Guaranteed_Convergence_for_Finding_a_Zero_of_a_Function","220452588_A_Simple_and_Relatively_Efficient_Triangulation_of_the_n-Cube","216301097_Computation_of_Equilibria_in_Finite_Games","39729098_Spectrum_Auction_Design","30814795_Fair_Payments_for_Efficient_Allocations_in_Public_Sector_Combinatorial_Auctions","24091025_Menu_Auctions_Resource_Allocation_and_Economic_Influence","4991779_Auction_Theory_A_Guide_to_the_Literature","4783679_Monotone_Equilibrium_in_Multi-Unit_Auctions","2672215_Quasi-Monte_Carlo_Integration"]}
