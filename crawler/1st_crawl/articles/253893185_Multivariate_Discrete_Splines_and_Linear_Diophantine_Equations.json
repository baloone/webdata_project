{"id":"253893185_Multivariate_Discrete_Splines_and_Linear_Diophantine_Equations","abstract":"Abstract In this paper we investigate the algebraic properties of multivariate discrete splines. It turns out that multivariate discrete splines are closely related to linear diophantine equations. In particular, we use a solvability condition for a system of linear diophantine equations to obtain a necessary and sucient,condition for the integer translates of a discrete box spline to be linearly independent. In order to understand the local structure of discrete splines we develop a general theory for certain systems of linear partial dierence equations. Using this theory we prove that the integer translates of a discrete box spline are locally linearly independent if and only if they are linearly independent.
