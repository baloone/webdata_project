{"id":"339317656_Entanglement_accessibility_measures_for_the_quantum_Internet","abstract":"We define metrics and measures to characterize the ratio of accessible quantum entanglement for complex network failures in the quantum Internet. A complex network failure models a situation in the quantum Internet in which a set of quantum nodes and a set of entangled connections become unavailable. A complex failure can cover a quantum memory failure, a physical link failure, an eavesdropping activity, or any other random physical failure scenarios. Here, we define the terms such as entanglement accessibility ratio, cumulative probability of entanglement accessibility ratio, probabilistic reduction of entanglement accessibility ratio, domain entanglement accessibility ratio, and occurrence coefficient. The proposed methods can be applied to an arbitrary topology quantum network to extract relevant statistics and to handle the quantum network failure scenarios in the quantum Internet.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["February 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-020-2605-y"],"references":["347427245_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Key_Distribution","344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","339309988_Theory_of_Noise-Scaled_Stability_Bounds_and_Entanglement_Rate_Maximization_in_the_Quantum_Internet","338507141_Optimizing_High-Efficiency_Quantum_Memory_with_Quantum_Machine_Learning_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Devices","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","336341938_Towards_Large-Scale_Quantum_Networks","336113153_Practical_figures_of_merit_and_thresholds_for_entanglement_distribution_in_quantum_networks","337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","336987449_Quantum_Computing_based_Hybrid_Solution_Strategies_for_Large-scale_Discrete-Continuous_Optimization_Problems"]}
