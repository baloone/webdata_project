{"id":"320312900_Absence_of_periodic_orbits_in_digital_memcomputing_machines_with_solutions","abstract":"In Traversa and Di Ventra [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)] we argued, without proof, that if the non-linear dynamical systems with memory describing the class of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have equilibrium points, then no periodic orbits can emerge. In fact, the proof of such a statement is a simple corollary of a theorem already demonstrated in Traversa and Di Ventra [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)]. Here, we point out how to derive such a conclusion. Incidentally, the same demonstration implies absence of chaos, a result we have already demonstrated in Di Ventra and Traversa [Phys. Lett. A 381, 3255 (2017)] using topology. These results, together with those in Traversa and Di Ventra [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)], guarantee that if the Boolean problem the DMMs are designed to solve has a solution, the system will always find it, irrespective of the initial conditions.","authors":["Massimiliano Di Ventra","Fabio Lorenzo Traversa"],"meta":["October 2017Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.) 27(10):101101","DOI:10.1063/1.5004431"],"references":["314361055_Absence_of_chaos_in_Digital_Memcomputing_Machines_with_solutions","313726720_Polynomial-time_solution_of_prime_factorization_and_NP-complete_problems_with_digital_memcomputing_machines","308611577_Passive_Macromodeling_Theory_and_Applications","44520123_Asymptotic_behavior_of_dissipative_systems_Jack_K_Hale"]}
