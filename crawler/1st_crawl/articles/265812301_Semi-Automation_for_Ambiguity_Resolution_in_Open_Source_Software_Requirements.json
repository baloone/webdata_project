{"id":"265812301_Semi-Automation_for_Ambiguity_Resolution_in_Open_Source_Software_Requirements","abstract":"The critical phase of Requirements Engineering (RE) is an active research domain for decades. The evolutions in RE over the years have improved them considerably but still many anomalies exist. It is especially true for the case of Open Source Software Development (OSSD) where most informal requirements and communications exist. With growing problems and extreme participant heterogeneity, the usual methods of ambiguity resolution do not seem to cater needs of OSSD community. For this purpose, various interdisciplinary mechanisms can be used to aid the community members and reach a consensus based agreement along with reaching unambiguous requirements sets. A framework is proposed for resolving the burdening problems of OSSD context. Framework components are discussed in detail to give an overview of developable ambiguity resolution strategies.","authors":["Kanwal Gill","Arif Raza","Athar Mohsin","Muhammad Muneeb"],"meta":["May 2014Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","DOI:10.1109/CCECE.2014.6900955","Conference: Computers, Software and Applications Symposium of the IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2014, CCECE"],"references":["300583278_Experience-Based_Requirements_Engineering_Tools","275354223_Two_Rule-Based_Natural_Language_Strategies_for_Requirements_Discovery_and_Classification_in_Open_Source_Software_Development_Projects","260537281_Ambiguity_Measures_in_Requirements_Engineering","243778730_Open-Source_Methods_Peering_Through_the_Clutter","234797128_Constraint-based_recommender_systems_Technologies_and_research_issues","228861133_From_Contract_Drafting_to_Software_Specification_Linguistic_Sources_of_Ambiguity","312471087_The_detection_and_classification_of_non-functional_requirements_with_application_to_early_aspects","292042071_Is_open_source_software_development_essentially_an_agile_method","266479977_Usability_in_open_source_software_development_Opinions_and_practice","261485799_Automated_text_mining_for_requirements_analysis_of_policy_documents"]}
