{"id":"251375604_New_MDS_self-dual_codes_over_finite_fields","abstract":"In this paper we construct MDS Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual codes which are extended cyclic duadic codes or negacyclic\ncodes. We also construct Euclidean self-dual codes which are extended negacyclic codes. Based on these constructions, a large\nnumber of new MDS self-dual codes are given with parameters for which self-dual codes were not previously known to exist.","authors":["Kenza Guenda"],"meta":["March 2012Designs Codes and Cryptography 62(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-011-9489-x"],"references":["247481215_Self-dual_codes_over_rings_and_the_Chinese_Remainder_Theorem","243118253_Optimal_linear_codes_over_Zm","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","299134842_QUANTUM_DUADIC_AND_AFFINE-INVARIANT_CODES","265538758_Lifted_codes_over_finite_chain_rings","263868083_QUANTUM_DUADIC_AND_AFFINE-INVARIANT_CODES","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","243103688_Finite_local_rings","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes"]}
