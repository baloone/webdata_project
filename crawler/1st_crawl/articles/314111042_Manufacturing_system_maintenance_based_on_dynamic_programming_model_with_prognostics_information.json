{"id":"314111042_Manufacturing_system_maintenance_based_on_dynamic_programming_model_with_prognostics_information","abstract":"The traditional maintenance strategies may result in maintenance shortage or overage, while deterioration and aging information of manufacturing system combined by single important equipment from prognostics models are often ignored. With the higher demand for operational efficiency and safety in industrial systems, predictive maintenance with prognostics information is developed. Predictive maintenance aims to balance corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance by observing and predicting the health status of the system. It becomes possible to integrate the deterioration and aging information into the predictive maintenance to improve the overall decisions. This paper presents an integrated decision model which considers both predictive maintenance and the resource constraint. First, based on hidden semi-Markov model, the system multi-failure states can be classified, and the transition probabilities among the multi-failure states can be generated. The upper triangular transition probability matrix is used to describe the system deterioration, and the changing of transition probability is used to denote the system aging process. Then, a dynamic programming maintenance model is proposed to obtain the optimal maintenance strategy, and the risks of maintenance actions are analyzed. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the implementation and potential applications of the proposed methods.","authors":["Qinming Liu","Ming Dong","Wenyuan Lv","Chunming Ye"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing 30(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10845-017-1314-6"],"references":["267896198_Improving_Multi-Objective_Test_Case_Selection_by_Injecting_Diversity_in_Genetic_Algorithms","260165282_Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning_based_maintenance_policy_for_a_resource_constrained_flow_line_system","287792681_Optimal_Lot-sizing_and_Maintenance_Policy_for_a_Partially_Observable_Production_System","282296581_A_dynamic_predictive_maintenance_model_considering_spare_parts_inventory_based_on_hidden_semi-Markov_model","281229710_Condition_monitoring_and_fault_diagnosis_of_an_MR_load_tap_changer_using_oil_analysis_data","281125556_Joint_optimal_lot_sizing_and_preventive_maintenance_policy_for_a_production_facility_subject_to_condition_monitoring","277634020_A_novel_method_using_adaptive_hidden_semi-Markov_model_for_multi-sensor_monitoring_equipment_health_prognosis","270991957_A_novel_optimal_preventive_maintenance_policy_for_a_cold_standby_system_based_on_semi-Markov_theory","270968937_Integrated_production_and_preventive_maintenance_scheduling_for_a_single_machine_with_failure_uncertainty","259634849_Failure_time_prediction_for_mechanical_device_based_on_the_degradation_sequence","245279094_On_the_Application_of_a_Model_of_Condition-Based_Maintenance","257356185_Joint_maintenance_and_inventory_optimization_systems_A_review","254409768_Integrating_noncyclical_preventive_maintenance_scheduling_and_production_planning_for_a_single_machine","251621917_A_joint_spare_part_and_maintenance_inspection_optimisation_model_using_the_Delay-Time_concept","233645335_Developments_in_Delay_Time_Analysis_for_Modelling_Plant_Maintenance"]}
