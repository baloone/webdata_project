{"id":"264915272_Networks_of_Polarized_Evolutionary_Processors_Are_Computationally_Complete","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the computational power of a new variant of networks of evolutionary processors which seems to be more suitable for a software and hardware implementation. Each processor as well as the data navigating throughout the network are now considered to be polarized. While the polarization of every processor is predefined, the data polarization is dynamically computed by means of a valuation mapping. Consequently, the protocol of communication is naturally defined by means of this polarization. We show that tag systems can be simulated by these networks with a constant number of nodes, while Turing machines can be simulated, in a time-efficient way, by these networks with a number of nodes depending linearly on the tape alphabet of the Turing machine.","authors":["Fernando Arroyo","Sandra GÃ³mez-Canaval","Victor Mitrana","Stefan Popescu"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-04921-2_8","Conference: International Conference on Language and Automata Theory and Applications"],"references":["237778696_Networks_of_evolutionary_processors_Java_implementation_of_a_threaded_processor","226864941_Accepting_Hybrid_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors","226458187_Networks_of_evolutionary_processors","226237299_Implementation_of_Massive_Parallel_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors_MPNEP_3-Colorability_Problem","31593969_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","21524891_Gene_Order_Comparisons_for_Phylogenetic_Inference_Evolution_of_the_Mitochondrial_Genome","293591076_CONNECTION_MACHINE","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","266304770_On_the_computational_complexity_of_algorithms","260113873_Networks_of_Polarized_Evolutionary_Processors_as_Problem_Solvers","247538411_Size_and_Structure_of_Universal_Turing_Machines_Using_Tag_Systems","242499889_Stearns_on_the_computational_complexity_of_algorithms","239538954_Formal_reduction_of_the_general_combinatorial_decision_problem","236628854_Computational_Complexity","228546182_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Word_and_Picture_Processors_A_Survey","228057894_Computational_Complexity","225201003_Small_universal_accepting_hybrid_networks_of_evolutionary_processors","224678305_On_the_time_complexity_of_2-tag_systems_and_small_universal_Turing_machines","222438863_The_Connection_Machine_a_Computer_Architecture_Based_on_Cellular_Automata","221426789_A_New_Class_of_Symbolic_Abstract_Neural_Nets_Tissue_P_Systems","221155631_Parallel_Simulation_of_NEPs_on_Clusters","220740769_Hybrid_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors","220543935_A_New_Characterization_of_NP_P_and_PSPACE_with_Accepting_Hybrid_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors","220349677_Accepting_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors_with_Filtered_Connections","220173515_On_the_size_complexity_of_universal_accepting_hybrid_networks_of_evolutionary_processors","220153895_Small_Universal_Turing_Machines"]}
