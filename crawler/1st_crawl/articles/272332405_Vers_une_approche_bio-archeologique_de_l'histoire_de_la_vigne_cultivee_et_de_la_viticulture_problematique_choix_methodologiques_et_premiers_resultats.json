This research is now being conducted so as to extend the set of references to the whole of Europe and the Mediterranean basin on the one hand and to improve morphometrical analysis methods to obtain a characterization going well beyond the simple wild/ cultivated dichotomy on the other hand. Among the cultivated section, the classical morphological approach might allow to distinguish at least two groups of cultivated vine species which have been more or less selected. The first group, which is also the most primitive, appears in Southern France at least as early as the First Iron Age. The soaring of the second group, which is the most productive, is not perceptible before the Modern times at the moment. The integration of carbonized archaeological grape pips in this scheme is backed on an experimental program the aim of which is modelling and correcting the deformation of pips during carbonization. The first results of a new geometrical analysis make us expect a more precise characterization of the genetic and geographic origins of archaeological pips.","authors":["Laurent Bouby","Jean-Frédéric Terral","Ivorra S.","Philippe Marinval"],"meta":["January 2005Archéologie du Midi médiéval 23(1):61-74","DOI:10.3406/amime.2005.1824"],"references":[]}
