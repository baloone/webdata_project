{"id":"259240023_Tensor_Networks_for_Lattice_Gauge_Theories_and_Atomic_Quantum_Simulation","abstract":"We show that gauge invariant quantum link models, Abelian and non-Abelian,\ncan be exactly described in terms of tensor networks states. Quantum link\nmodels represent an ideal bridge between high-energy to cold atom physics, as\nthey can be used in cold-atoms in optical lattices to study lattice gauge\ntheories. In this framework, we characterize the phase diagram of a (1+1)-d\nquantum link version of the Schwinger model in an external classical background\nelectric field: the quantum phase transition from a charge and parity ordered\nphase with non-zero electric flux to a disordered one with a net zero electric\nflux configuration is described by the Ising universality class.","authors":["Enrique Rico Ortega","T.
