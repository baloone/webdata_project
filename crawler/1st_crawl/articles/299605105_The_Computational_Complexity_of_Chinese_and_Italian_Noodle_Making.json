{"id":"299605105_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Chinese_and_Italian_Noodle_Making","abstract":"This paper describes several traditional algorithms for making Chi- nese and Italian noodles and classifies each according to its computational com- plexity. It examines machines for doing each algorithm. It cites a world speed record for making a large number of noodles using the algorithm with the max- imal complexity. It dissects mysteries about the legend that Marco Polo brought the technology of making noodles to Italy from China. It determines that both Chinese and Italian ways of eating food can be applied to both Chinese and Ital- ian noodle dishes. It compares the power of the algorithms. It considers the nature of variations of the traditional algorithms. It concludes by mentioning avenues for further studies.","authors":["Daniel M.
