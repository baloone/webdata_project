{"id":"305977186_Random_Johnson-Mehl_tessellations","abstract":"A unified exposition of random Johnson–Mehl tessellations in d -dimensional Euclidean space is presented. In particular, Johnson-Mehl tessellations generated by time-inhomogeneous Poisson processes and nucleation-exclusion models are studied. The ‘practical' cases d = 2 and d = 3 are discussed in detail. Several new results are established, including first- and second-order moments of various characteristics for both Johnson–Mehl tesselations and sectional Johnson–Mehl tessellations.","authors":["Jesper Møller"],"meta":["December 1992Advances in Applied Probability 24(04):814-844","DOI:10.1017/S0001867800024964"],"references":["266249433_A_Note_on_the_Time-Non-Homogeneous_Johnson-Mehl_Tessellation","248831823_Laws_of_Expanding_Circles_and_Spheres_in_Relation_to_Lateral_Growth_of_Surface_Films_and_Grain_Size_of_Metals","248495148_ASTM_grain-size_model_and_related_random_tessellation_models","247329295_Random_Tessellations_in_IRd","244508686_The_Effect_of_Nucleation_Conditions_on_the_Topology_and_Geometry_of_Two-Dimensional_Grain_Structures","240404195_Comparative_Analysis_of_the_Cellular_and_Johnson-Mehl_Microstructures_through_Computer_Simulation","229763065_Geometric_Measures_for_Random_Curved_Mosaics_of_Rd","229677202_Topological_Mean_Value_Relations_for_Random_Cell_Complexes","227202286_Ergodic_Theorems_for_Spatial_Processes","38366276_Random_Subdivisions_of_Space_into_Crystals","38361115_Random_Cell_Complexes_and_Generalised_Sets"]}
