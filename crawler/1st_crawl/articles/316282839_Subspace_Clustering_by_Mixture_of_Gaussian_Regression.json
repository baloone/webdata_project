{"id":"316282839_Subspace_Clustering_by_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Regression","abstract":"Subspace clustering is a problem of finding a multi-\nsubspace representation that best fits sample points drawn\nfrom a high-dimensional space. The existing clustering\nmodels generally adopt different norms to describe noise,\nwhich is equivalent to assuming that the data are corrupt-\ned by specific types of noise. In practice, however, noise\nis much more complex. So it is inappropriate to simply\nuse a certain norm to model noise. Therefore, we pro-\npose Mixture of Gaussian Regression (MoG Regression)\nfor subspace clustering by modeling noise as a Mixture of\nGaussians (MoG). The MoG Regression provides an effec-\ntive way to model a much broader range of noise distri-\nbutions. As a result, the obtained affinity matrix is better\nat characterizing the structure of data in real applications.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that\nMoG Regression significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nsubspace clustering methods.","authors":["Baohua li","Ying zhang","Zhouchen Lin","Huchuan Lu"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298821","Conference: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"references":["335013092_Generalized_Principal_Component_Analysis_GPCA","263618856_Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Complex_Noise","262391178_Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso","261860538_Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering","261850856_Robust_and_Efficient_Subspace_Segmentation_via_Least_Squares_Regression","258972643_On_Convergence_Properties_of_the_EM_Algorithm_for_Gaussian_Mixtures","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","308315436_Robust_principal_component_analysis_with_complex_noise","268688503_On_the_convergence_properties_of_the_EM_algorithm"]}
