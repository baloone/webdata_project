{"id":"303217800_Rate_region_boundary_of_the_Z-interference_channel_with_improper_signaling","abstract":"This paper provides a complete characterization of the boundary of the achievable rate region, also called the Pareto boundary, of the Z interference channel (Z-IC), when interference is treated as noise and users employ an improper Gaussian signaling scheme. By considering the augmented complex formulation, we describe the Pareto boundary by three interference regimes, for which different closed-form expressions for the optimal transmit power and circularity coefficient (i.e., degree of impropriety) are provided. These regimes are defined through thresholds on the ratio between the gain of the interfering channel and the gain of the direct channel of the interfering user. The simplicity of the obtained characterization permits drawing interesting insights into when and how improper signaling outperforms proper signaling in the single-antenna Z-IC. We provide an in-depth discussion on the interference regimes and the relationship between the degrees of impropriety of both users.","authors":["Christian Lameiro","Ignacio Santamar√≠a","Peter J.
