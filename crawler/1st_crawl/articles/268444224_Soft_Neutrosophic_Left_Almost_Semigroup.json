{"id":"268444224_Soft_Neutrosophic_Left_Almost_Semigroup","abstract":"In this paper we have extended neutrosophic LA-semigroup, neutrosophic sub LA-semigroup, neutrosophic ideals, neutosophic prime ideals, neutrosophic semiprime ideals, neutrosophic strong irreducible ideals to soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup,soft neutosophic sub LA-semigroup,soft neutrosophic ideals,soft neutrosophic prime ideals,soft neutrosophic semiprime ideals and soft strong irreducible neutrosophic ideals respectively. We have found some new notions related to the strong or pure part of neutrosophy and we give explaination with necessary illustrative examples. We have also given rigorious theorems and propositions. The notion of soft neutrosophic homomorphism is presented at the end.","authors":["Florentin Smarandache","Mumtaz Ali","Munazza Naz","Muhammad Shabir"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.1502616"],"references":["286800187_Characterizations_of_regular_left_almost_semigroups_by_their_fuzzy_ideals","220510798_On_some_new_operations_in_soft_set_theory","24268973_Ideals_in_Left_Almost_Semigroups","314362930_Some_Studies_in_Soft_LA-Semigroups","309457075_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","308949570_Soft_Neutrosophic_Bigroup_and_Soft_Neutrosophic_N-Group","292397384_Pure_spectrum_of_an_ag-groupoid_with_left_identity_and_zero","267447142_Groupoids_satisfying_a_simple_invertive_law","265876345_On_almost_semigroups","220312418_Soft_sets_and_soft_groups"]}
