{"id":"228577268_Mapping_the_Results_of_Geographically_Weighted_Regression","abstract":"Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local spatial statistical technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity. Previous approaches to mapping the results of GWR have primarily employed an equal step classification and sequential no-hue colour scheme for choropleth mapping of parameter estimates. This cartographic approach may hinder the exploration of spatial nonstationarity by inadequately illustrating the spatial distribution of the sign, magnitude, and significance of the influence of each explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Approaches for improving mapping of the results of GWR are illustrated using a case study analysis of population densityâ€“median home value relationships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. These approaches employ data classification schemes informed by the (nonspatial) data distribution, diverging colour schemes, and bivariate choropleth mapping.","authors":["Jeremy Mennis"],"meta":["July 2006Cartographic Journal The 43(2)","DOI:10.1179/000870406X114658"],"references":["253631315_Mapping_Census_2000_The_Geography_of_US_Diversity","250015602_Interactivity_Types_in_Geographic_Visualization_Cartography_and_Geographic_Information_Science","314514534_The_Local_Voter_A_Geographically_Weighted_Approach_to_Ecological_Inference","309255210_Local_indicator_of_spatial_association-LISA","282368395_Interactivity_types_in_geographic_visualization","278897523_A_comparison_of_optimal_classification_strategies_for_choroplethic_displays_of_spatially_aggregated_data","274842481_Atlas_of_United_States_Mortality","270618322_Geographically_Weighted_Regression_The_Analysis_of_Spatially_Varying_Relationships_review","264587417_Geographically_Weighted_Regression","246449770_In_The_Matter_Of_Class_Intervals_For_Choropleth_Maps_With_Particular_Reference_To_The_Work_Of_George_F_Jenks"]}
