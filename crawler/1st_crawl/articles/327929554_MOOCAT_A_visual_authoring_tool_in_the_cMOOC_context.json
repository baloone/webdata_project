{"id":"327929554_MOOCAT_A_visual_authoring_tool_in_the_cMOOC_context","abstract":"This paper presents an authoring tool in the cMOOC context called MOOCAT (MOOC Authoring Tool). It is a visual authoring tool that helps teachers to design cMOOC-oriented pedagogical scenarios. MOOCAT has two main innovative features. The first is that it offers a tool for conceiving pedagogical scenarios in a simple way through graphical representation, by providing the functionality to design learning workflows. The second is related to its capacity to bridge the gap between the conception phase and its execution into different LMS (Learning Management System), by offering services that allow the automatic deployment of pedagogical scenarios to existing platforms (e.g. OpenEDX, Moodle, etc.). This facilitates the authoring process considerably, and enhances the ability of teachers to concentrate their efforts on the content. This paper presents the model underlying MOOCAT, and describes the cMOOC scenario-building process. Also, the paper highlights the findings from a case study which was organized in order to evaluate the utility and the usability of the tool, and the usefulness of its innovative feature of conceiving and deploying a cMOOC scenario into OpenEDX platform. MOOCAT seems to be an easy-to-use tool, which offers guidance and flexibility during the design process.","authors":["Bakki Aicha","Lahcen Oubahssi","SÃ©bastien George","Chihab Cherkaoui"],"meta":["March 2019Education and Information Technologies","DOI:10.1007/s10639-018-9807-2","Project: ALS-CPL"],"references":["320186493_Metaliteracy_as_Pedagogical_Framework_for_Learner-Centered_Design_in_Three_MOOC_Platforms_Connectivist_Coursera_and_Canvas","316901188_Understanding_Learners'_Motivation_and_Learning_Strategies_in_MOOCs","308050271_Modelisation_et_implementation_de_dispositifs_pedagogiques_avec_BPMN_20","301728994_MOOC_model_Dimensions_and_model_design_to_develop_learning","269900212_Orchestrating_learning_activities_using_the_CADMOS_learning_design_tool","267411691_The_Effect_of_Experience_on_System_Usability_Scale_Ratings","308049840_Modeliser_et_implementer_des_dispositifs_pedagogiques_avec_BPMN_20_Etude_exploratoire_pour_la_modelisation_et_l'implementation_de_scenarios_pedagogiques_orientes_processus","283019023_COLearn_and_open_discovery_space_portal_alignment_A_case_of_enriching_open_learning_infrastructures_with_collaborative_learning_capabilities","281660659_Approche_Domain-Specific_Modeling_pour_l'operationnalisation_des_scenarios_pedagogiques_sur_les_plateformes_de_formation_a_distance","276935128_IMS_learning_design_specification_Version_10_final_specification","265915730_Proposal_for_a_Conceptual_Framework_for_Educators_to_Describe_and_Design_MOOCs","263784897_Do_MOOCs_need_a_Special_Instructional_Design","262167521_A_methodology_proposal_for_developing_Adaptive_cMOOC","256474439_A_Pedagogy_of_Abundance_or_a_Pedagogy_to_Support_Human_Beings_Participant_Support_on_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","258422618_The_pedagogical_foundations_of_massive_open_online_courses_First_Monday"]}
