{"id":"220314865_Operations_on_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"We define the operations of Cartesian product, composition, union, and join on fuzzy subgraphs of graphs G1 and G2. If the graph G is formed from G1 and G2 by one of these operations, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary fuzzy subgraph of G also to be formed by the same operation from fuzzy subgraphs of G1 and G2.","authors":["John N.
