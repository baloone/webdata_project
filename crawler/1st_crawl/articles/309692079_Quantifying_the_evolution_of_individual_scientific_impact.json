{"id":"309692079_Quantifying_the_evolution_of_individual_scientific_impact","abstract":"Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional impact of a scientist, little is known about how scientific impact emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in impact and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that impact, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications. This random-impact rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter Q to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist’s impact, from the h-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.","authors":["Roberta Sinatra","Dashun Wang","Pierre Deville","Chaoming Song"],"meta":["November 2016Science 354(6312):aaf5239-aaf5239","DOI:10.1126/science.aaf5239"],"references":["301233136_Diffusion_of_scientific_credits_and_the_ranking_of_scientists","282426900_A_century_of_physics","276441411_Systematic_inequality_and_hierarchy_in_faculty_hiring_networks","275335177_The_Leiden_Manifesto_for_research_metrics","262204177_New_insights_into_the_relationship_between_the_h-index_and_self-citations","261838322_Career_on_the_Move_Geography_Stratification_and_Scientific_Impact","259368438_Bibliometrics_Global_Gender_Disparities_in_Science","258116439_On_the_Predictability_of_Future_Impact_in_Science","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","254734326_Creative_Productivity_A_Predictive_and_Explanatory_Model_of_Career_Trajectories_and_Landmarks","236946558_Universality_of_scholarly_impact_metrics","235615532_Persistence_and_Uncertainty_in_the_Academic_Career","233729906_White_D_Structural_Cohesion_and_Embeddedness_A_Hierarchical_Concept_of_Social_Groups_American_Sociological_Review_68_103-127","230841691_Future_impact_Predicting_scientific_success","227268737_A_quantitative_analysis_of_indicators_of_scientific_performance","220065960_A_multilevel_meta-analysis_of_studies_reporting_correlations_between_the_h_index_and_37_different_h_index_variants","51779695_Age_dynamics_in_scientific_creativity","51587059_Statistical_Validation_of_a_Global_Model_for_the_Distribution_of_the_Ultimate_Number_of_Citations_Accrued_by_Papers_Published_in_a_Scientific_Journal","49826567_Metaknowledge","45871955_Scaling_laws_of_human_interaction_activity","44646839_The_role_of_mentorship_in_protege_performance","24026922_Open_Access_and_Global_Participation_in_Science","23445478_Universality_of_citation_distributions_Toward_an_objective_measure_of_scientific_impact","23310020_Multi-University_Research_Teams_Shifting_Impact_Geography_and_Stratification_in_Science","21854714_Long_Range_Correlations_in_Nucleotide_Sequences","11964012_A_question_of_scale","6617704_Measure_for_measures","6397622_The_Increasing_Dominance_of_Teams_in_Production_of_Knowledge","2525031_Social_Cohesion_and_Embeddedness_A_Hierarchical_Conception_of_Social_Groups","2173158_Citation_Statistics_from_110_Years_of_Physical_Review","332499856_Statistics_of_Extremes","298808365_The_Simultaneous_Evolution_of_Author_and_Paper_Networks","264712167_Collective_credit_allocation_in_science","257888872_Research_assessments_Judgement_day","257350302_Future_Science","232499349_Career_Landmarks_in_Science_Individual_Differences_and_Interdisciplinary_Contrasts","230818153_Measures_for_measures","230663933_An_introduction_to_statistical_modeling_of_extreme_values_-_springer","227690748_Incentives_and_Creativity_Evidence_from_the_Academic_Life_Sciences","223987432_Research_efficiency_Turn_the_scientific_method_on_ourselves","28810368_h-index_A_Review_Focused_in_its_Variants_Computation_and_Standardization_for_Different_Scientific_Fields","24401382_A_proposal_for_calculating_weighted_citations_based_on_author_rank","10768562_Universal_Scaling_Relations_in_Food_Webs","8687635_The_simultaneous_evolution_of_article_and_author_networks_in_PNAS","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output","7004611_Cash_for_papers_Putting_a_premium_on_publication","5466973_Mapping_topics_and_topic_bursts_in_PNAS"]}
