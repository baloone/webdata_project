Distributed video coding (DVC), an emerging coding technology based on Wyner-Ziv theory, seems to be a possible solution for implementing low-power video sensors since most of the computational complexity is moved from the encoder to the decoder. In this paper, existing works on DVC are discussed with rate-distortion and power consumption analyses compared with H.264/AVC-based approaches. We show that, since more transmission power is required for compensating the lower rate-distortion performance, the power consumption of sensor nodes using DVC is just similar to that of using H.264/AVC with zero motion vectors. Therefore, there is still a room for improvement to make DVC applicable for distributed wireless video sensors. Based on our analysis results, several possible research directions, such as studies on the tradeoff between hardware cost and system power consumption, are also addressed in this paper under a unified DVC framework.","authors":["Chieh-Chuan Chiu","Shao-Yi Chien","Chia-han Lee","V.
