{"id":"281824600_Robotic_Telepresence_in_a_Medical_Intensive_Care_Unit_-_Clinicians'_Perceptions","abstract":"Background: Robotic telepresence has been used for outsourcing of healthcare services for more than a decade; however, its use within an academic medical department is not yet widespread. Intensive care unit (ICU) robots can be used to increase access to off-site supervising physicians and other specialists, reducing possible wait time for difficult admissions and procedures.\n\nObjective: To study the use of ICU robots through a pilot program in an academic hospital and examine provider attitudes toward the usability and effectiveness of an ICU robot.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The study was done as a postinterventional cross-sectional seven-question survey in a medical ICU in an urban academic hospital. Participants were attending physicians, fellows, residents, nurses, and respiratory therapists.\n\nResults: Users of the ICU robot reported satisfaction with communication, and improved patient care. They also reported perceived improved quality of care with the use of the robot.\n\nConclusions: Findings show the importance of a whole-team approach to the installation and implementation of an ICU robot. The ICU robot is an effective tool when it is used to visualize and communicate with patients, bedside staff, and families. However, a number of providers are still not trained or have not been shown how to use the ICU robot, which affects the overall utilization rate.","authors":["Mirna Becevic","Martina A Clarke","Mohammed Alnijoumi","Sonika Sohal"],"meta":["July 2015Perspectives in health information management / AHIMA, American Health Information Management Association 12(July):1-9"],"references":["271220009_Can_Utilizing_a_Computerized_Provider_Order_Entry_CPOE_System_Prevent_Hospital_Medical_Errors_and_Adverse_Drug_Events","256190858_The_use_of_remote_presence_for_health_care_delivery_in_a_northern_Inuit_community_A_feasibility_study","236083021_Enhancing_trauma_education_worldwide_through_telemedicine","51664985_The_Anatomy_of_Teleneurosurgery_in_China","41944488_Design_and_Characterization_of_Hand_Module_for_Whole-Arm_Rehabilitation_Following_Stroke","337553401_Tele-ICU_Myth_Busters","258065005_Adoption_of_ICU_Telemedicine_in_the_United_States","254263936_Staff_acceptance_of_a_telemedicine_intensive_care_unit_program_A_qualitative_study","230564418_Tele-ICU_myth_busters","228080774_Utilization_of_Robotic_Remote_Presence_Technology_Within_North_American_Intensive_Care_Units","224870659_Implementation_of_a_Model_of_Robotic_Tele-Presence_RTP_in_the_Neuro-ICU_Effect_on_Critical_Care_Nursing_Team_Satisfaction","221826340_Robotic_remote_presence_technology_in_the_surgical_intensive_care_unit","51797082_Barriers_to_Telemedicine_Survey_of_Current_Users_in_Acute_Care_Units","51747622_A_Working_Lexicon_for_the_Tele-Intensive_Care_Unit_We_Need_to_Define_Tele-Intensive_Care_Unit_to_Grow_and_Understand_It","26810058_Tele-ICU_experience_to_date","26756547_Does_Telemonitoring_Of_Patients-The_eICU-Improve_Intensive_Care","23063970_Telemedicine_in_critical_care_An_experiment_in_health_care_delivery","12175201_Intensive_care_unit_telemedicine_Alternate_paradigm_for_providing_continuous_intensivist_care","8931714_Effect_of_a_multiple-site_intensive_care_unit_telemedicine_program_on_clinical_and_economic_outcomes_An_alternative_paradigm_for_intensivist_staffing","7624595_Robotic_telepresence_in_the_intensive_care_unit"]}
