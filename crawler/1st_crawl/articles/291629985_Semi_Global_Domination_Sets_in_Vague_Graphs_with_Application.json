{"id":"291629985_Semi_Global_Domination_Sets_in_Vague_Graphs_with_Application","abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the concepts of domination set, global domination set, semi global domination set, semi complementary vague graph, and purely semi complete vague graph and obtain some interesting results for these new parameters. Finally, we have given some applications of domination sets in vague graphs and other sciences.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 30(6)","DOI:10.3233/IFS-162110","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","235943829_Vague_Sets"]}
