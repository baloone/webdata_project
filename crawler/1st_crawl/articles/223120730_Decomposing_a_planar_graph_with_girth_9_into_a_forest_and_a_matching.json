{"id":"223120730_Decomposing_a_planar_graph_with_girth_9_into_a_forest_and_a_matching","abstract":"W. He et al. showed that a planar graph of girth 11 can be decomposed into a forest and a matching. D. Kleitman et al. proved the same statement for planar graphs of girth 10. We further improve the bound on girth to 9.","authors":["Oleg V. Borodin","Alexandr V.
