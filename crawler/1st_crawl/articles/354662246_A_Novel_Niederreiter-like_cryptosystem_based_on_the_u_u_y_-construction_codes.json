{"id":"354662246_A_Novel_Niederreiter-like_cryptosystem_based_on_the_u_u_y_-construction_codes","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new variant of the Niederreiter Public Key Encryption (PKE) scheme which is resistant against recent attacks. The security is based on the hardness of the Rank Syndrome Decoding (RSD) problem and it presents a ( u | u + υ )-construction code using two different types of codes: Ideal Low Rank Parity Check (ILRPC) codes and λ -Gabidulin codes. The proposed encryption scheme benefits are a larger minimum distance, a new efficient decoding algorithm and a smaller ciphertext and public key size compared to the Loidreau’s variants and to its IND-CCA secure version.","authors":["Roumaissa Mahdjoubi","Pierre Louis Cayrel","Sedat Akleylek","Kenza Guenda"],"meta":["January 2021RAIRO - Theoretical Informatics and Applications 55:10","DOI:10.1051/ita/2021010"],"references":["338191014_polarRLCE_A_New_Code-Based_Cryptosystem_Using_Polar_Codes","301843129_Improved_Cryptanalysis_of_Rank_Metric_Schemes_Based_on_Gabidulin_Codes","283531644_Extension_of_Overbeck's_Attack_for_Gabidulin_Based_Cryptosystems","347383182_Improvements_of_Algebraic_Attacks_for_Solving_the_Rank_Decoding_and_MinRank_Problems","334157488_An_IND-CCA-Secure_Code-Based_Encryption_Scheme_Using_Rank_Metric","332411804_A_New_Gabidulin-Like_Code_and_Its_Application_in_Cryptography","318145423_A_New_Rank_Metric_Codes_Based_Encryption_Scheme","308862991_New_algorithms_for_decoding_in_the_rank_metric_and_an_attack_on_the_LRPC_cryptosystem","306117487_Using_Reed-Solomon_codes_in_the_U_U_V_construction_and_an_application_to_cryptography","280850103_Low_Rank_Parity_Check_codes_and_their_application_to_cryptography","257555030_Modified_Niederreiter_type_of_GPT_cryptosystem_based_on_reducible_rank_codes","279264040_Decoding_of_block_and_convolutional_codes_in_rank_metric","261635703_On_the_Hardness_of_the_Decoding_and_the_Minimum_Distance_Problems_for_Rank_Codes","251265078_New_Technique_for_Decoding_Codes_in_the_Rank_Metric_and_Its_Cryptography_Applications","243776483_Knapsack_Type_Cryptosystems_and_Algebraic_Coding_Theory"]}
