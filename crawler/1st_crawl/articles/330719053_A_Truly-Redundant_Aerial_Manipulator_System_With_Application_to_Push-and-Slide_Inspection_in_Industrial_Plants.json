{"id":"330719053_A_Truly-Redundant_Aerial_Manipulator_System_With_Application_to_Push-and-Slide_Inspection_in_Industrial_Plants","abstract":"We present the design, motion planning and control of an aerial manipulator for a non-trivial physical interaction task, namely pushing while sliding on curved surfaces. The proposed robotic system is motivated by the increasing interest in autonomous non-destructive tests for industrial plants. The proposed aerial manipulator consists of a multidirectional-thrust aerial vehicle to enhance physical interaction capabilities, endowed with a 2-DoFs lightweight arm to enlarge its workspace. This combination constitutes a truly-redundant manipulator that goes beyond standard aerial manipulators based on collinear multirotor platforms. The robot controller is based on a PID method with ‘displaced’ positional part, inspired by the control of manipulators with elastic joints. In this work, we experimentally show that the proposed aerial manipulator system, equipped with an Eddy Current probe, is able to scan a metallic pipe sliding the sensor over its surface and preserving the contact. From the acquired data, a weld on the pipe is successfully detected and mapped.","authors":["Marco Tognon","Hermes Amadeus Tello Chavez","Enrico Gasparin","Quentin Sablé"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2019.2895880"],"references":["327025637_The_AEROARMS_Project_Aerial_Robots_with_Advanced_Manipulation_Capabilities_for_Inspection_and_Maintenance","323857962_Towards_a_Flying_Assistant_Paradigm_the_OTHex","322994718_Control-Aware_Motion_Planning_for_Task-Constrained_Aerial_Manipulation","320837520_Towards_Automatic_Robotic_NDT_Dense_Mapping_for_Pipeline_Integrity_Inspection","318693969_Adaptive_closed-loop_speed_control_of_BLDC_motors_with_applications_to_multi-rotor_aerial_vehicles","318693968_6D_physical_interaction_with_a_fully_actuated_aerial_robot","316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","311755244_Modeling_and_control_of_FAST-Hex_A_fully-actuated_by_synchronized-tilting_hexarotor","329592344_A_Truly_Redundant_Aerial_Manipulator_exploiting_a_Multi-directional_Thrust_Base","312210566_Principal_Component_Analysis"]}
