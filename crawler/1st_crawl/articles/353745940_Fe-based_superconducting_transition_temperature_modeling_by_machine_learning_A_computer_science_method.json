{"id":"353745940_Fe-based_superconducting_transition_temperature_modeling_by_machine_learning_A_computer_science_method","abstract":"Searching for new high temperature superconductors has long been a key research issue. Fe-based superconductors attract researchersâ€™ attention due to their high transition temperature, strong irreversibility field, and excellent crystallographic symmetry. By using doping methods and dopant levels, different types of new Fe-based superconductors are synthesized. The transition temperature is a key indicator to measure whether new superconductors are high temperature superconductors. However, the condition for measuring transition temperature are strict, and the measurement process is dangerous. There is a strong relationship between the lattice parameters and the transition temperature of Fe-based superconductors. To avoid the difficulties in measuring transition temperature, in this paper, we adopt a machine learning method to build a model based on the lattice parameters to predict the transition temperature of Fe-based superconductors. The model results are in accordance with available transition temperatures, showing 91.181% accuracy. Therefore, we can use the proposed model to predict unknown transition temperatures of Fe-based superconductors.","authors":["Zhiyuan Hu"],"meta":["August 2021PLoS ONE 16(8):e0255823","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0255823"],"references":["346539866_Deficits_in_motor_and_cognitive_functions_in_an_adult_mouse_model_of_hypoxia-ischemia_induced_stroke","343986082_Machine_Learning_Lattice_Constants_for_Cubic_Perovskite_Compounds","342340346_A_novel_framework_for_approximation_of_magneto-resistance_curves_of_a_superconducting_film_using_GMDH-type_neural_networks","342219296_Machine_Learning_Band_Gaps_of_Doped-TiO_2_Photocatalysts_from_Structural_and_Morphological_Parameters","341790600_Relative_cooling_power_modeling_of_lanthanum_manganites_using_Gaussian_process_regression","341748194_Curie_Temperature_Modeling_of_Magnetocaloric_Lanthanum_Manganites_using_Gaussian_Process_Regression","340678721_Predicting_the_Thermal_Conductivity_Enhancement_of_Nanofluids_using_Computational_Intelligence","340654571_Machine_Learning_Modeling_of_Lattice_Constants_for_Half-Heusler_Alloys","340113774_Predicting_Doped_MgB2_Superconductor_Critical_Temperature_from_Lattice_Parameters_using_Gaussian_Process_Regression","340062232_Machine_learning_the_magnetocaloric_effect_in_manganites_from_compositions_and_structural_parameters","339423378_Guided_Patchwork_Kriging_to_Develop_Highly_Transferable_Thermal_Conductivity_Prediction_Models","334077067_Coupling_High-throughput_Property_Map_to_Machine_Learning_for_Predicting_Lattice_Thermal_Conductivity","332775102_Quench_behavior_of_high_temperature_superconductor_REBa2Cu3Ox_CORC_cable","331855159_Quench_Protection_System_of_a_1_MW_High_Temperature_Superconductor_DC_Induction_Heater","330029346_Predicting_Electron-Phonon_Coupling_Constants_of_Superconducting_Elements_by_Machine_Learning"]}
