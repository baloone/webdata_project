{"id":"228643600_A_Secure_and_Efficient_Off-line_Electronic_Payment_System_for_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"An electronic cash system allows the exchange of digital coins with value assured by the bank's signature and with concealed user identity. In an electronic cash system, a user can withdraw coins from the bank and then spends each coin anonymously and unlinkably. In this paper we propose a secure and efficient off-line electronic payment system based on bilinear pairings and group signature schemes. The anonymity of the customer is revocable by a trustee in case of a dispute. Because the amount of communication in the payment protocol is about 480 bits, the proposed off-line electronic payment system can be used in wireless networks with limited bandwidth.","authors":["Horea Oros","Constantin Popescu"],"meta":["November 2010International Journal of Computers, Communications & Control (IJCCC) V(4):551-557","DOI:10.15837/ijccc.2010.4.2513"],"references":["227088517_Efficient_signature_generation_by_smart_cards","221348232_Divisible_E-Cash_Systems_Can_Be_Truly_Anonymous","220335324_A_New_ID-based_Group_Signature_Scheme_from_Bilinear_Pairings","220334042_Practical_Anonymous_Divisible_E-Cash_From_Bounded_Accumulators","3297381_A_flexible_payment_scheme_and_its_role-based_access_control","313163148_An_efficient_divisible_electronic_cash_scheme","260667439_Design_and_implementation_of_an_efficient_fair_off-line_E-cash_system_based_on_elliptic_curve_discrete_logarithm_problem","245462488_New_ID-based_group_signature_from_pairings","225671744_Identity-Based_Encryption_from_the_Weil_Pairing","224638425_Cascaded_Authorization_with_Anonymous-Signer_Aggregate_Signatures","221355564_An_Efficient_Divisible_Electronic_Cash_Scheme","221355153_Blind_Signatures_for_Untraceable_Payments","221354999_Universal_Electronic_Cash","221354901_Untraceable_Electronic_Cash","220314045_A_provably_secure_short_signature_scheme_based_on_discrete_logarithms","220312051_Ownership-attached_unblinding_of_blind_signatures_for_untraceable_electronic_cash","220073756_An_Electronic_Cash_System_Based_on_Group_Blind_Signatures","2477400_Aggregate_and_Verifiably_Encrypted_Signatures_from_Bilinear_Maps"]}
