{"id":"268278854_A_Survey_on_the_Teaching_and_Learning_of_Recursive_Programming","abstract":"We survey the literature about the teaching and learning of recursive programming. More precisely, we present the history of the advent of recursion in programming languages and its adoption by programmers, curricular approaches, textbooks, methodology, functional and imperative programming, control flow vs. data flow, the problem with base cases, induction in mathematics, analogies for recursion, games, visualizations and animations, multimedia environments, intelligent tutoring systems, visual programming, the Logo years, theoretical didactics, including constructivist and constructionist theories of learning, mental models, kinesthetic learning and syntonicity, etc. We append an extensive bibliography which was very carefully collated.","authors":["Christian Rinderknecht"],"meta":["April 2014Informatics in Education 13(1):87-119","Project: Didactics of computer programming"],"references":["327593012_Educational_Games_in_Higher_Education_a_case_study_in_teaching_recursive_algorithms","314835039_Recursive_functional_programming_as_a_conceptual_tool_for_social_scientists","314721145_Mental_models_of_recursion","313596302_The_principles_of_arithmetic_presented_by_a_new_method","305262118_On_Teaching_Recursion","304206707_Learning_and_Mathematics_Games","301426189_Depth-first_digraph_algorithms_without_recursion","288348132_Recursive_thinking_and_solving_methods_Journal_of_the_Korea_Society_of_Mathematical_Education","287004472_Animating_recursive_algorithms","285331089_Picturing_recursion"]}
