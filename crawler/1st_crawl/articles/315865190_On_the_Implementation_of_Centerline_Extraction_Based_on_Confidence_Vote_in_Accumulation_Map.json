{"id":"315865190_On_the_Implementation_of_Centerline_Extraction_Based_on_Confidence_Vote_in_Accumulation_Map","abstract":"This paper focuses on the implementation details of a recent method which extracts the centerline of 3D shapes using solely partial mesh scans of these shapes. This method [9] extracts the shape centerline by constructing an accumulation map from input points and normal vectors and by filtering it with a confidence vote. This paper presents in details all the algorithms of the method and describes the implementation and development choices. Some experiments test the robustness to the parameter variability and show the current limitations allowing to consider further improvements.","authors":["Bertrand Kerautret","Adrien Krähenbühl","Isabelle Debled-Rennesson","Jacques-Olivier Lachaud"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-56414-2_9","Conference: International Workshop on Reproducible Research in Pattern Recognition"],"references":["316449837_Centerline_detection_on_partial_mesh_scans_by_confidence_vote_in_accumulation_map","285308094_Variational_anisotropic_surface_meshing_with_Voronoi_parallel_linear_enumeration","279310793_3D_Geometric_Analysis_of_Tubular_Objects_Based_on_Surface_Normal_Accumulation","234781366_On_Centroidal_Voronoi_Tessellation--Energy_Smoothness_and_Fast_Computation","221068443_3D_is_here_Point_cloud_library_PCL","316447966_Segmentation_of_defects_on_log_surface_from_terrestrial_lidar_data","303744568_What_does_research_reproducibility_mean","301561383_3D_Skeletons_A_State-of-the-Art_Report","275897584_A_Survey_on_skeletonization_algorithms_and_their_applications","247439038_Mean_Curvature_Skeletons"]}
