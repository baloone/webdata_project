{"id":"319535405_Nearest_Embedded_and_Embedding_Self-Nested_Trees","abstract":"Self-nested trees present a systematic form of redundancy in their subtrees and thus achieve optimal compression rates by DAG compression. A method for quantifying the degree of self-similarity of plants through self-nested trees has been introduced by Godin and Ferraro in 2010. The procedure consists in computing a self-nested approximation, called the nearest embedding self-nested tree, that both embeds the plant and is the closest to it. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that computes the nearest embedding self-nested tree with a smaller overall complexity, but also the nearest embedded self-nested tree. We show from simulations that the latter is mostly the closest to the initial data, which suggests that this better approximation should be used as a privileged measure of the degree of self-similarity of plants.","authors":["Romain Aza√Øs"],"meta":["September 2017Algorithms 12(9)","DOI:10.3390/a12090180","Project: Tree-structured data"],"references":["47621737_Quantifying_the_Degree_of_Self-Nestedness_of_Trees_Application_to_the_Structural_Analysis_of_Plants","271924576_XML_Compression_via_Directed_Acyclic_Graphs","263981158_SUBTREE_ISOMORPHISM_IS_IN_DLOG_FOR_NESTED_TREES","236248217_Tree_Compression_with_Top_Trees","222837282_The_complexity_of_tree_automata_and_XPath_on_grammar-compressed_trees","222818813_Efficient_memory_representation_of_XML_document_trees","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220224183_A_Constrained_Edit_Distance_Between_Unordered_Labeled_Trees","4021748_Query_evaluation_on_compressed_trees"]}
