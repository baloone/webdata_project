{"id":"312835867_Admissibility_and_Unifiability_in_Contact_Logics","abstract":"Contact logics are logics for reasoning about the contact relations between regular subsets in a topological space. Admissible inference rules can be used to improve the performance of any algorithm that handles provability within the context of contact logics. The decision problem of unifiability can be seen as a special case of the decision problem of admissibility. In this paper, we examine the decidability of admissibility problems and unifiability problems in contact logics.","authors":["Philippe Balbiani","Çiğdem Gencer"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-46906-4_4","Conference: International Tbilisi Symposium on Logic, Language, and Computation"],"references":["330422421_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422329_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422013_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_A_Proximity_Approach-I","226341313_Region-Based_Theory_of_Space_Algebras_of_Regions_Representation_Theory_and_Logics","225258947_Unification_in_the_Description_Logic","220443747_Modal_Logics_for_Region-based_Theories_of_Space","220245362_Unification_in_modal_and_description_logics","31492449_Unifiability_in_extensions_of_K4","1959894_Undecidability_of_the_unification_and_admissibility_problems_for_modal_and_description_logics","250603156_A_criterion_for_admissibility_of_rules_in_the_model_system_S4_and_the_intuitionistic_logic","245215801_Admissibility_of_Logical_Inference_Rules","222410062_A_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_contact_algebras","222199248_Best_solving_modal_equations","220394664_Unification_in_linear_temporal_logic_LTL","220388299_Admissible_Rules_of_Lukasiewicz_Logic","220245153_Description_of_Modal_Logics_Inheriting_Admissible_Rules_for_K4","38384120_Unification_in_Intuitionistic_Logic","27715698_Proof_theory_for_admissible_rules"]}
