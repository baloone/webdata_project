{"id":"2985220_Face_recognition_Eigenface_elastic_matching_and_neural_nets","abstract":"This paper is a comparative study of three recently proposed\nalgorithms for face recognition: eigenface, autoassociation and\nclassification neural nets, and elastic matching. After these algorithms\nwere analyzed under a common statistical decision framework, they were\nevaluated experimentally on four individual data bases, each with a\nmoderate subject size, and a combined data base with more than a hundred\ndifferent subjects. Analysis and experimental results indicate that the\neigenface algorithm, which is essentially a minimum distance classifier,\nworks well when lighting variation is small. Its performance\ndeteriorates significantly as lighting variation increases. The elastic\nmatching algorithm, on the other hand, is insensitive to lighting, face\nposition, and expression variations and therefore is more versatile. The\nperformance of the autoassociation and classification nets is upper\nbounded by that of the eigenface but is more difficult to implement in\npractice","authors":["Jun Zhang","Yong Yan","M.
