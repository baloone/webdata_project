{"id":"255420371_A_Case_Based_Expert_System_for_Supporting_Diagnosis_of_Heart_Diseases","abstract":"In this paper, we have used the Case Based Reasoning methodology to develop a case-based expert system prototype for supporting diagnosis of heart diseases. 110 cases were collected for 4 heart diseases namely; mitral stenosis, left-sided heart failure, stable angina pectoris and essential hypertension. Each case contains 207 attributes concerning both demographic and clinical data. After removing the duplicated cases, the system has trained set of 42 cases for Egyptian cardiac patients. Statistical analysis has been done to determine the importance values of the case features. Two retrieval strategies were investigated namely; induction and nearest-neighbor approaches. The results indicate that the nearest neighbor is better than the induction strategy, where the retrieval accuracy were 100% and 53.8% respectively. Cardiologists have evaluated the overall system performance where the system was able to give a correct diagnosis for thirteen new cases.","authors":["Abdel-Badeeh M.Salem","Mohamed Roushdy","Rania Hodhod"],"meta":["December 2004"],"references":["227446337_A_Composite_Approach_to_Inducing_Knowledge_for_Expert_Systems_Design","262315295_Roll_your_own_hybrids","236471124_A_Guide_to_Expert_Systems"]}
