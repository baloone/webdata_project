{"id":"281322923_Minimization_iteration_procedure_of_potential_energy_and_structural_analysis_for_the_tension_cable-strut_structure","abstract":"The tension cable-strut structure features flexibility, nonlinearity, and morphology complex nature. This needs complicated state transformation and computational algorithm for structural analysis. On the basis of minimization iteration procedure of potential energy, the equilibrium was developed through iteration method. The potential energy, decent vector of potential energy minimization and incremental iteration step-length were formulated sequentially. The iteration procedure was formulated with Conjugate Gradient of potential energy minimization, and the program was developed accordingly with VC++. The program was proved correct through numerical verification of a typical orthogonal square cable-net structure. The load-capacity and deformation performance were investigated for a novel hexagonal cable-net and a novel two-story tensegrity structure respectively. The minimum potential energy iterative method was demonstrated effective for the nonlinear structural analysis of flexible cable-strut structure.","authors":["Wu-jun Chen","G.-S. Du","X.-Q.
