{"id":"276296187_Massive_MIMO_with_Multi-cell_MMSE_Processing_Exploiting_All_Pilots_for_Interference_Suppression","abstract":"In this paper, a new state-of-the-art multi-cell MMSE scheme is proposed for\nmassive MIMO networks, which includes an uplink MMSE detector and a downlink\nMMSE precoder. The main novelty is that it exploits all available pilots for\ninterference suppression. Specifically, let $K$ and $B$ denote the number of\nusers per cell and the number of orthogonal pilot sequences in the network,\nrespectively, where $\\beta = B/K$ is the pilot reuse factor. Then our\nmulti-cell MMSE scheme utilizes all $B$ channel directions, that can be\nestimated locally at each base station, to actively suppress both intra-cell\nand inter-cell interference. The proposed scheme is particularly practical and\ngeneral, since power control for the pilot and payload, imperfect channel\nestimation and arbitrary pilot allocation are all accounted for. Simulations\nshow that significant spectral efficiency (SE) gains are obtained over the\nsingle-cell MMSE scheme and the multi-cell ZF, particularly for large $\\beta$\nand/or $K$. Furthermore, large-scale approximations of the uplink and downlink\nSINRs are derived, which are asymptotically tight in the large-system limit.\nThe approximations are easy to compute and very accurate even for small system\ndimensions. Using these SINR approximations, a low-complexity power control\nalgorithm is also proposed to maximize the sum SE.","authors":["Xueru Li","Emil Bj√∂rnson","Erik G.
