Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected with COVID-19, and we attempted to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have an unbalanced dataset (fewer cases of COVID-19 along with more cases from other classes). We also propose a neural network that is a concatenation of the Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. For evaluating our network, we have tested it on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy achievable in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network for detecting COVID-19 cases is 99.50%, and the overall average accuracy for all classes is 91.4%.","authors":["Mohammad Rahimzadeh","Abolfazl Attar"],"meta":["May 2020Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 19:100360","DOI:10.1016/j.imu.2020.100360","Project: Detecting COVID-19 from X-ray & CT scan images with Deep Learning"],"references":["351445526_Automatic_detection_of_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_using_X-ray_images_and_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","349577188_A_deep_learning_algorithm_using_CT_images_to_screen_for_Corona_virus_disease_COVID-19","340742582_Development_of_an_Assessment_Method_for_Investigating_the_Impact_of_Climate_and_Urban_Parameters_in_Confirmed_Cases_of_COVID-19_A_New_Challenge_in_Sustainable_Development","340158749_Clinical_Features_of_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_Pneumonia_Presented_Gastrointestinal_Symptoms_But_Without_Fever_Onset","340060889_Artificial_Intelligence_Distinguishes_COVID-19_from_Community_Acquired_Pneumonia_on_Chest_CT","339703924_Review_of_the_Clinical_Characteristics_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19","340359021_Chest_CT_Severity_Score_An_Imaging_Tool_for_Assessing_Severe_COVID-19","340279344_Covid-19_Automatic_detection_from_X-Ray_images_utilizing_Transfer_Learning_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","340045504_Clinical_features_of_severe_pediatric_patients_with_coronavirus_disease_2019_in_Wuhan_a_single_center's_observational_study","339099692_Emerging_Coronavirus_2019-nCoV_Pneumonia"]}
