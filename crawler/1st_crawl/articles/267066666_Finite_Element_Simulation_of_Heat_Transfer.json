{"id":"267066666_Finite_Element_Simulation_of_Heat_Transfer","abstract":"This book introduces the finite element method applied to the resolution of industrial heat transfer problems. Starting from steady conduction, the method is gradually extended to transient regimes, to traditional non-linearities, and to convective phenomena. Coupled problems involving heat transfer are then presented. Three types of couplings are discussed: coupling through boundary conditions (such as radiative heat transfer in cavities), addition of state variables (such as metallurgical phase change), and coupling through partial differential equations (such as electrical phenomena). A review of the various thermal phenomena is drawn up, which an engineer can simulate. The methods presented will enable the reader to achieve optimal use from finite element software and also to develop new applications.","authors":["Jean-Michel Bergheau","Roland Fortunier"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1002/9780470611418.part1","Edition: ISTE -WileyISBN: 9781848210530"],"references":["260793261_A_numerical_model_for_multiple_phase_transformations_in_steels_during_thermal_processes","227803904_Quasi-Newton_iterative_strategies_applied_to_heat_diffusion_equation","3110223_Coupling_between_finite_elements_and_boundary_elements_for_the_numerical_simulation_of_induction_heating_processes_using_a_harmonic_balance_method","285297829_Inter-relation_of_hardenability_and_isothermal_transformation_data","284034358_Prevision_des_contraintes_residuelles_induites_par_traitement_thermique_et_thermochimique","268708785_A_brief_survey_of_convergence_results_for_quasi-Newton_methods","250158695_Mathematical_Model_Coupling_Phase_Transformations_and_Temperature_Evolutions_in_Steels","239394730_An_Implicit_Fixed-Grid_Method_for_the_Finite-Element_Analysis_of_Heat_Transfer_Involving_Phase_Changes","236558493_Computer_Implementation_Accuracy_and_Timing_of_Radiation_View_Factor_Algorithms","234176384_Radiation_View_Factors_by_Finite_Elements","233169665_Use_of_the_discrete_maximum_principle_in_finite-element_analysis_of_combined_conduction_and_radiation_in_nonparticipating_media","233027414_Resistance_Spot_Welding_Process_Experimental_and_Numerical_Modeling_of_the_Weld_Growth_Mechanisms_with_Consideration_of_Contact_Conditions","232935625_The_discrete_maximum_principle_in_finite-element_thermal_radiation_analysis","229808565_An_Improved_Algorithm_for_Heat_Conduction_Problems_with_Phase_Change","229767999_An_isoparametric_boundary_solution_for_thermal_radiation","227925362_Solution_of_radiative_problems_using_variational_based_finite_element_method","227909146_Finite_elementNewton_method_for_the_analysis_of_Czochralski_crystal_growth_with_diffuse-grey_radiative_heat_transfer","227828821_Grey-body_surface_radiation_coupled_with_conduction_and_convection_for_general_geometries","226923628_The_Complementarity_Problem","226287992_Finite_element_of_solidification_problems","223504590_Continuous_in_situ_measurement_of_quenching_distortions_using_computer_vision","37437815_Simulation_of_Solidification_of_Alloys_by_the_Finite-Element_Method","23893846_A_Comparative_Study_of_Methods_for_Computing_the_Diffuse_Radiation_Viewfactors_for_Complex_Structures","3099816_The_coupling_of_boundary_elements_and_finite_elements_for_nondestructive_testing_applications","3097438_Magneto-thermal_behavior_finite_element_analysis_for_ferromagnetic_materials_in_induction_heating_devices"]}
