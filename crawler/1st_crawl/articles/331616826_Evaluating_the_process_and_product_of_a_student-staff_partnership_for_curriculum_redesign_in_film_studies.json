{"id":"331616826_Evaluating_the_process_and_product_of_a_student-staff_partnership_for_curriculum_redesign_in_film_studies","abstract":"This paper describes a student-staff partnership to design learning activities and assessments for an undergraduate Film Studies course. Four students and three staff designed the new assessments and learning activities to develop studentsâ€™ knowledge and skills to produce a video essay. The new assessments were co-developed in semester one so that students in semester two could experiment, innovate and think critically using the logics and form of film itself. We evaluated both the product (the new assessments and activities) and the process (the partnership). The evaluation of the project was positive, with students enrolled in the unit engaged in the technical and intellectual challenges of this new form of assessment. Student partners brought complementary knowledges and perspectives to the project, while extending their skills and awareness of behind-the-scenes curriculum development processes at the university. The paper provides insights into the benefits and challenges of student-staff partnerships for curriculum redesign.","authors":["Amani Bell","Susan Potter","Lisa-Anne Morris","Mirjana Strbac"],"meta":["March 2019Innovations in Education and Teaching International 56(6):1-11","DOI:10.1080/14703297.2019.1588768"],"references":["285647504_Students_as_ambassadors_and_researchers_of_assessment_renewal_puzzling_over_the_practices_of_university_and_academic_life","279448454_A_model_of_active_student_participation_in_curriculum_design_exploring_desirability_and_possibility","267569494_Improving_Engagement_and_Learning_through_Sharing_Course_Design_with_Students_A_Multi-level_Case","264240134_Engagement_through_partnership_students_as_partners_in_learning_and_teaching_in_higher_education","262918987_Using_the_Context_Input_Process_and_Product_Evaluation_Model_CIPP_as_a_Comprehensive_Framework_to_Guide_the_Planning_Implementation_and_Assessment_of_Service-learning_Programs","235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology","44190302_How_to_Use_Five_Curriculum_Design_Principles_to_Align_Authentic_Learning_Environments_Assessment_Students'_Approaches_to_Thinking_and_Learning_Outcomes","327004151_Engaging_Students_as_Participants_and_Partners_An_Argument_for_Partnership_with_Students_in_Higher_Education_Research_on_Student_Success","323344441_Lessons_we_still_need_to_learn_on_creating_more_inclusive_and_responsive_classrooms_recommendations_from_one_student-faculty_partnership_programme","281132090_A_Bag_Full_of_Snakes_Negotiating_the_Challenges_of_Multimodal_Composition","271200971_Engaging_students_as_partners_in_learning_and_teaching_a_guide_for_faculty","263614979_Student_as_co-producer_in_a_marketised_higher_education_system_A_case_study_of_students'_experience_of_participation_in_curriculum_design","263611426_Student_academic_partners_student_employment_for_collaborative_learning_and_teaching_development"]}
