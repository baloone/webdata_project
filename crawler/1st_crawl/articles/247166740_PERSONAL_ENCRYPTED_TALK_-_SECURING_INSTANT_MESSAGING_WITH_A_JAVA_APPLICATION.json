{"id":"247166740_PERSONAL_ENCRYPTED_TALK_-_SECURING_INSTANT_MESSAGING_WITH_A_JAVA_APPLICATION","abstract":"Most users of mainstream Instant Messaging applications on the Internet don't realize their conver- sations are being transmitted in clear text and are vulnerable to eavesdropping during transmission. This project report presents a solution to this problem implemented in a final project for CS699 in the spring of 2005 at Rivier College. The project was entitled Personal Encrypted Talk and its primary goal was to secure Instant Messaging communications between two parties on the Internet. Secondary objectives were Java Cryptography Architecture research and the practical experience gained by the author in the development of a scalable Java based Graphical User Interface application. This article summarizes the software engineering steps followed during the implementation of this project.","authors":["David Snogles"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":[]}
