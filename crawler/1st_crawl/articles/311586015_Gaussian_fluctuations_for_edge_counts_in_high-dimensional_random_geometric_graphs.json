{"id":"311586015_Gaussian_fluctuations_for_edge_counts_in_high-dimensional_random_geometric_graphs","abstract":"Consider a stationary Poisson point process in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and connect any two points whenever their distance is less than or equal to a prescribed distance parameter. This construction gives rise to the well known random geometric graph. The number of edges of this graph is counted that have midpoint in the $d$-dimensional unit ball. A quantitative central limit theorem for this counting statistic is derived, as the space dimension $d$ and the intensity of the Poisson point process tend to infinity simultaneously.","authors":["Jens Grygierek","Christoph Thaele"],"meta":["December 2016Statistics & Probability Letters 158","DOI:10.1016/j.spl.2019.108674"],"references":["228577846_High-Dimensional_Random_Geometric_Graphs_and_their_Clique_Number","326327482_Lectures_on_random_geometric_graphs","321543358_Stochastic_Analysis_for_Poisson_Point_Processes_Malliavin_Calculus_Wiener-Ito_Chaos_Expansions_and_Stochastic_Geometry","276192052_Mini-Workshop_Stochastic_Analysis_for_Poisson_Point_Processes_Malliavin_Calculus_Wiener-Ito_Chaos_Expansions_and_Stochastic_Geometry","268689600_Testing_for_high-dimensional_geometry_in_random_graphs","259954249_Normal_approximation_on_Poisson_spaces_Mehler's_formula_second_order_Poincar_inequalities_and_stabilization","259335421_Limit_theory_for_the_Gilbert_graph","51001110_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_U-Statistics_of_Poisson_Point_Processes"]}
