{"id":"312546415_Ethics_in_robotics_research_CERNA_recommendations","abstract":"This article summarizes the recommendations concerning robotics as issued by the Commission for the Ethics of Research in Information Sciences and Technologies (CERNA), the French advisory commission for the ethics of information and communication technology (ICT) research. Robotics has numerous applications in which its role can be overwhelming and may lead to unexpected consequences. In this rapidly evolving technological environment, CERNA does not set novel ethical standards but seeks to make ethical deliberation inseparable from scientific activity. Additionally, it provides tools and guidance for researchers and research institutions.","authors":["Alexei Grinbaum","Raja Chatila","Laurence Devillers","Jean-Gabriel Ganascia"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MRA.2016.2611586"],"references":["270960170_Automation_surprises","262343607_Formal_Detection_of_Attentional_Tunneling_in_Human_Operator-Automation_Interactions","259825007_Petri_net-based_modelling_of_human-automation_conflicts_in_aviation","250799793_Automation_and_Accountability_in_Decision_Support_System_Interface_Design","320182421_Superintelligence_paths_dangers_strategies","276118955_Inference_of_Human_Beings'_Emotional_States_from_Speech_in_Human-Robot_Interactions","272087403_Governing_Lethal_Behavior_in_Autonomous_Robots","252963196_Global_Catastrophic_Risks","220690766_The_Human_Use_of_Human_Beings_Cybernetics_And_Society","7749921_Challenges_in_real-life_emotion_annotation_and_machine_learning_based_detection"]}
