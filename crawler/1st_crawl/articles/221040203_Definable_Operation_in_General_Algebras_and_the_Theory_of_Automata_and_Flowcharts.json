{"id":"221040203_Definable_Operation_in_General_Algebras_and_the_Theory_of_Automata_and_Flowcharts","abstract":"We study the class of operations definable from the given operations of an algebra of sets by union, composition, and fixed\npoints; we obtain two theorems on definable operations that give us as special case the regular-equals-recognisable theorem\nof generalised finite automata theory. Definable operations arise also as the operations computable by charts; by translating\ninto predicate logic, we obtain Manna's formulas for termination and correctness of flowcharts.","authors":["Hans Bekic"],"meta":["January 1984","DOI:10.1007/BFb0048939","SourceDBLP","Conference: Programming Languages and Their Definition - Hans Bekic (1936-1982)"],"references":["316322255_Universal_Algebra","268538938_Programs_and_their_proofs_An_algebraic_approach","226689038_Generalized_finite_automata_theory_with_an_application_to_a_decision_problem_of_second-order_logic","222813158_The_correctness_of_programs","221590414_Formalization_of_Properties_of_Recursively_Defined_Functions","220547330_The_Correctness_of_Nondeterministic_Programs","220431921_Properties_of_Programs_and_the_First-Order_Predicate_Calculus","220248319_Automata_in_General_Algebras","213877823_The_Mechanical_Evaluation_of_Expressions","38347971_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Fixpoint_Theorem_and_Its_Applications"]}
