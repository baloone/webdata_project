{"id":"317166774_A_Heterosynaptic_Spiking_Neural_System_for_the_Development_of_Autonomous_Agents","abstract":"Artificial neural systems for computation were first proposed three quarters of\na century ago and the concepts developed by the pioneers still shape the field\ntoday. The first generation of neural systems was developed in the nineteen forties\nin the context of analogue electronics and the theoretical research in logic and\nmathematics that led to the first digital computers in nineteen forties and fifties.\nThe second generation of neural systems implemented on digital computers was\nborn in the nineteen fifties and great progress was made in the subsequent half\ncentury with neural networks being applied to many problems in pattern recognition\nand machine learning. Through this history there has been an interplay between\nbiologically inspired neural systems and their implementation by engineers on\ndigital machines. This thesis concerns the third generation of neural networks,\nSpiking Neural Networks, which is making possible the creation of new kinds of\nbrain inspired computing architectures that offer the potential to increase the level\nof realism and sophistication in terms of autonomous machine behaviour and\ncognitive computing. This thesis presents the development and demonstration of a\nnew theoretical architecture for third generation neural systems, the Integrate-andFire\nbased Spiking Neural Model with extended Neuro-modulated Spike Timing\nDependent Plasticity capabilities. This proposed architecture overcomes the limitation\nof the homosynaptic architecture underlying existing implementations of\nspiking neural networks that it lacks a natural spike timing dependent plasticity\nregulation mechanism, and this results in ‘run away’ dynamics. To overcome this\nad hoc procedures have been implemented to overcome the ‘run away’ dynamics\nthat emerge from the use of spike timing dependent plasticity among other\nhebbian-based plasticity rules. The new heterosynaptic architecture presented,\nexplicitly abstracts the modulation of complex biochemical mechanisms into a\nsimplified mechanism that is suitable for the engineering of artificial systems with\nlow computational complexity. Neurons work by receiving input signals from other\nneurons through synapses. The difference between homosynaptic and heterosynaptic\nplasticity is that, in the former the change in the properties of a synapse\n(e.g. synaptic efficacy) depends on the point to point activity in either of the sending\nand receiving neurons, in contrast for heterosynaptic plasticity the change in\nthe properties of a synapse can be elicited by neurons that are not necessary\npresynaptic or postsynaptic to the synapse in question. The new architecture is\ntested by a number of implementations in simulated and real environments. This\nincludes experiments with a simulation environment implemented in Netlogo, and\nan implementation using Lego Mindstorms as the physical robot platform. These\nexperiments demonstrate the problems with the traditional Spike timing dependent\nplasticity homosynaptic architecture and how the new heterosynaptic approach\ncan overcome them. It is concluded that the new theoretical architecture provides\na natural, theoretically sound, and practical new direction for research into the role\nof modulatory neural systems applied to spiking neural networks.","authors":["Cristian Jimenez Romero"],"meta":["November 2016","Thesis for: PhDAdvisor: Professor Jeff Johnson"],"references":["303846142_SpikingLab_modelling_agents_controlled_by_Spiking_Neural_Networks_in_Netlogo","303636070_Does_computational_neuroscience_need_new_synaptic_learning_paradigms","291387276_Neuromodulated-Spike-Timing-Dependent_Pasticity_and_Theory_of_Three-Factor_Learning_Rules","321551759_Modulation_of_Synaptic_Transmission_and_Plasticity_in_Nervous_Systems","320978771_Retroactive_modulation_of_spike_timing-dependent_plasticity_by_dopamine","305815329_Principles_of_Neural_Science_Fifth_Edition","305267748_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_brain_Fourth_edition","292312010_Logical_calculus_of_the_ideas_immanent_in_nervous_activity","291208484_Neuronal_dynamics_From_single_neurons_to_networks_and_models_of_cognition","289857677_Cholinergic_and_Noradrenergic_Modulation_of_Long-term_Potentiation_in_Hippocampal_CA3_Neurons","280565301_A_Model_for_Foraging_Ants_Controlled_by_Spiking_Neural_Networks_and_Double_Pheromones","288875670_Modulation_of_membrane_currents_and_excitability_by_serotonin_and_cAMP_in_pleural_sensory_neurons_of_Aplysia","287200113_Heterosynaptic_correlates_of_long-term_potentiation_induction_in_hippocampal_CA3_neurons","271106685_A_spiking_neuronal_network_model_of_fast_associative_learning_in_the_honeybee","269760167_The_Organization_of_Behavior_A_Neuropsychological_Theory"]}
