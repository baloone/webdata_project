{"id":"309298111_A_novel_architecture_of_CNN_based_on_SVM_classifier_for_recognising_Arabic_handwritten_script","abstract":"Convolutional neural network (CNN), as a deep learning algorithms being developed for years, have been successfully applied in various domains of computer vision and pattern recognition. Recently, support vector machine (SVM) classifier has received more attention for script recognition. In this paper, we investigated a new model based on the integration of two classifiers which are CNN and SVM methods for offline Arabic handwriting recognition. The proposed system modified the CNN trainable classifier by the SVM classifier. CNN-based SVM aims at extracting an automatically a high representation of the data via multi-layers in a deep hierarchical structure and performing classification. The training and the test sets were taken from the HACDB database. Experimental results gave 97.35% and 93.41% character recognition accuracy using 24 and 66 classes, respectively. This is statistically significantly important in comparison with character recognition accuracies obtained from state-of-the-art Arabic OCR.","authors":["Mohamed Elleuch","Najiba Tagougui","Monji Kherallah"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications 15(4):323","DOI:10.1504/IJISTA.2016.10000779"],"references":["277339801_Novel_feature_extraction_technique_for_the_recognition_of_handwritten_digits","271851109_Handwritten_Arabic_Character_Recognition_Which_Feature_Extraction_Method","266323616_An_Arabic_Handwriting_System","264044866_Arabic_Handwritten_Script_Recognition_Towards_Generalization_A_Survey","261167777_HACDB_Handwritten_Arabic_characters_database_for_automatic_character_recognition","258845358_Effective_technique_for_the_recognition_of_offline_Arabic_handwritten_words_using_hidden_Markov_models","224716259_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Invariant_Feature_Hierarchies_with_Applications_to_Object_Recognition","222699464_Support_vector_machines_versus_multi-layer_perceptrons_for_efficient_off-line_signature_recognition","221619818_Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_audio_classification_using_convolutional_deep_belief_networks","220933057_Gabor_Features_for_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition","220861586_Combining_Multiple_HMMs_Using_On-line_and_Off-line_Features_for_Off-line_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition","220860992_Best_Practices_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Visual_Document_Analysis","220424626_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Hierarchical_Representations_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Networks","48199502_High-Performance_Neural_Networks_for_Visual_Object_Classification","24428970_Combining_Slanted-Frame_Classifiers_for_Improved_HMM-Based_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition","4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting","3906274_Handwritten_digit_recognition_by_combining_support_vector_machines_using_rule-based_reasoning","3194075_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_A_Survey","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","2427763_Face_Recognition_by_Support_Vector_Machines","312538118_Support-vector_networks","309760586_Ifnenit-database_of_handwritten_arabic_words_Proceedings_of_CIFED_vol","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","306157314_Extreme_learning_machine_for_regression_and_multiclass_classification","305284409_Recognizing_Arabic_Handwritten_Script_using_Support_Vector_Machine_classifier","287506257_Statistical_features_based_character_recognition_for_offline_handwritten_Tamil_document_images_using_HMM","287506183_SIFT_descriptors_for_Arabic_handwriting_recognition","286571746_Convolutional_deep_belief_networks_for_feature_extraction_of_EEG_signal","285729560_Towards_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Arabic_Handwritten_Recognition_Using_Deep_Architectures","281715840_Deep_Learning_for_Feature_Extraction_of_Arabic_Handwritten_Script","272623654_Libsvm","261464767_Transfer_learning_for_Latin_and_Chinese_characters_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","261314669_Tandem_HMM_with_convolutional_neural_network_for_handwritten_word_recognition","243659305_NIST_Special_Database_19_Handprinted_Forms_and_Characters_Database","226662568_The_IAM-database_An_English_sentence_database_for_offline_handwriting_recognition","224315224_Handwritten_Arabic_character_recognition_based_on_SVM_Classifier","224265587_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Committees_For_Handwritten_Character_Classification","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","220860565_Results_of_the_RIMES_Evaluation_Campaign_for_Handwritten_Mail_Processing","220785870_Applications_of_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition_A_Survey","220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","220645821_Offline_handwritten_Arabic_cursive_text_recognition_using_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_re-ranking","220601731_A_novel_hybrid_CNN-SVM_classifier_for_recognizing_handwritten_digits","220359425_A_Survey_on_Pattern_Recognition_Applications_of_Support_Vector_Machines","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition","200086000_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition"]}
