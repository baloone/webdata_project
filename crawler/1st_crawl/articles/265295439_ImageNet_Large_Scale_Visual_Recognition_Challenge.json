{"id":"265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","abstract":"The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in\nobject category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories\nand millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to\npresent, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions.\nThis paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances\nin object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the\nchallenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key\nbreakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide detailed a analysis of\nthe current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object\ndetection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human\naccuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the five years of the challenge,\nand propose future directions and improvements.","authors":["Olga Russakovsky","Jia Deng","Hao Su","Jonathan Krause"],"meta":["September 2014International Journal of Computer Vision 115(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["347495711_Learning_Generative_Visual_Models_from_Few_Training_Examples_An_Incremental_Bayesian_Approach_Tested_on_101_Object_Categories","319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770370_Three_things_everyone_should_know_to_improve_object_retrieval","319770363_Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification","319770264_Regularization_of_Neural_Networks_using_DropConnect","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","314450504_Object_detection_using_a_max-margin_Hough_transform"]}
