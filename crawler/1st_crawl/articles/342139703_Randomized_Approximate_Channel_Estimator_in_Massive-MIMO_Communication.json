{"id":"342139703_Randomized_Approximate_Channel_Estimator_in_Massive-MIMO_Communication","abstract":"Massive MIMO is considered as one key enabling technology in 5G communications. Although the high-quality channel state information (CSI) estimation is essential to improve the energy/spectrum efficiency of massive MIMO systems, the optimal MMSE estimator unfortunately creates one major challenge, due to its formidable computation complexity. In this letter, we propose a rank-restrained low-complexity MMSE channel estimator for massive MIMO communications, leveraging a novel concept of randomized low-rank approximation. To accomplish this, we first design a two-stage pilot training scheme. Rather than directly estimating the large channel matrix as usual, we then acquire two low-dimensional subsets of it, which respectively gives the row and column sampling version of unknown channel matrix. Finally, we reconstruct the complete channel matrix via such two estimated low-dimensional sketches, by exploiting the low-rank structure of channel. As demonstrated, our scheme significantly reduces the time complexity as well as the energy consumption in CSI acquisition, which yet attains the near-optimal estimation accuracy. It thus provides great promises to the practical deployment of massive MIMO communications.","authors":["Bin Li","Shuseng Wang","Jun Zhanga","Xianbin Cao"],"meta":["June 2020IEEE Communications Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3001931"],"references":["335500603_Hybrid_Beamforming_with_Random_Analog_Sampling_for_Wideband_Channel_Estimation_in_Millimeter_Wave_Massive_MIMO_Systems","283275238_Joint_CSIT_acquisition_based_on_low-rank_matrix_completion_for_FDD_massive_MIMO_systems","267099660_Low-Rank_Spatial_Channel_Estimation_for_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Systems","259845213_Low-Complexity_Polynomial_Channel_Estimation_in_Large-Scale_MIMO_With_Arbitrary_Statistics","236274573_Massive_MIMO_for_Next_Generation_Wireless_Systems","220232281_Multistage_linear_receivers_for_DS-CDMA_systems","3318819_Transmit_Signal_Design_for_Optimal_Estimation_of_Correlated_MIMO_Channels","314288944_Optimal_CUR_Matrix_Decompositions","310463923_Iterative_Channel_Estimation_Using_LSE_and_Sparse_Message_Passing_for_MmWave_MIMO_Systems","309623621_An_Overview_of_Low-Rank_Channel_Estimation_for_Massive_MIMO_Systems","276174897_Beam_Division_Multiple_Access_Transmission_for_Massive_MIMO_Communications","262368151_Relative-Error_CUR_Matrix_Decompositions","260672991_Energy_and_Spectral_Efficiency_of_Very_Large_Multiuser_MIMO_Systems","260635439_Massive_MIMO_in_the_ULDL_of_cellular_networks_How_many_antennas_do_we_need","236136516_Improving_CUR_Matrix_Decomposition_and_the_Nystrom_Approximation_via_Adaptive_Sampling","224180963_Noncooperative_Cellular_Wireless_with_Unlimited_Numbers_of_Base_Station_Antennas"]}
