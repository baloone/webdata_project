{"id":"333013384_Korean_Song-lyrics_Generation_by_Deep_Learning","abstract":"In order to create a lyrics based on the characteristics of Korean, we reversed the K-pop lyrics data and use them as learning data. It transforms the incoming data to use certain elements of the sentence, such as predicates and conjunctions, as starting points of the string generation. The proposed song lyrics generation method considers the context between lyrics. Every time the model generates the lyric, the model goes through upper randomization based on a blank. It was confirmed that the lyrics generated using the reverse data, have a more natural context than the lyrics generated using the forward data. It is also possible to generate new lyrics similar to certain lyric structure.","authors":["Sung-Hwan Son","young-hyun Lee","Gyu-Hyeon Nam","Seungshik Kang"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1145/3321454.3321470","Conference: the 2019 4th International Conference"],"references":["308324937_SeqGAN_Sequence_Generative_Adversarial_Nets_with_Policy_Gradient","236166532_Markov_Constraints_for_Generating_Lyrics_with_Style","322695080_MaskGAN_Better_Text_Generation_via_Filling_in_the","320248296_Generating_Chinese_Classical_Poems_with_RNN_Encoder-Decoder","319770249_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions","318828956_Seqgan_sequence_generative_adversarial_nets_with_policy_gradient","305997530_DopeLearning_A_Computational_Approach_to_Rap_Lyrics_Generation","301880585_Generating_Chinese_Classical_Poems_with_RNN_Encoder-Decoder","301446030_GhostWriter_Using_an_LSTM_for_Automatic_Rap_Lyric_Generation","291412150_Chinese_Poetry_Generation_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","262394162_Unsupervised_Rhyme_Scheme_Identification_in_Hip_Hop_Lyrics_Using_Hidden_Markov_Models"]}
