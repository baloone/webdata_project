{"id":"265239568_Temporal_Logics_Beyond_Regularity","abstract":"Non-regular program correctness properties play an important role in the specification of unbounded buffers, recursive procedures, etc. This thesis surveys results about the relative expressive power and complexity of temporal logics which are capable of defining non-regular properties. In particular, it features Propositional Dynamic Logic of Context-Free Programs, Fixpoint Logic with Chop, the Modal Iteration Calculus, and Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic.\n\nRegarding expressive power we consider two classes of structures: arbitrary transition systems as well as finite words as a subclass of the former. The latter is meant to give an intuitive account of the logics' expressive powers by relating them to known language classes defined in terms of grammars or Turing Machines. \n\nRegarding the computational complexity of temporal logics beyond regularity we focus on their model checking problems since their satisfiability problems are all highly undecidable. Their model checking complexities range between polynomial time and non-elementary.","authors":["Martin Lange"],"meta":["January 2007BRICS Report Series 14(13)","DOI:10.7146/brics.v14i13.22178"],"references":["262250075_Sometimes_and_not_never_revisited_on_branching_versus_linear_time_temporal_logic","234816535_A_temporal_fixpoint_calculus","234807189_Automatic_Verification_of_Finite_State_Concurrent_Systems_Using_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","228398107_On_the_Existence_of_a_Finite_Base_for_Complete_Trace_Equivalence_over_BPA_with_Interrupt","226455381_Using_Fairness_to_Make_Abstractions_Work","225178220_Bounded_Model_Checking_Using_Satisfiability_Solving","222054355_Analyzing_Ambiguity_of_Context-Free_Grammars","220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","220700739_A_Higher_Order_Modal_Fixed_Point_Logic","220689159_Model_Checking","275870105_Time_and_Modality","268886070_Expressive_equivalence_of_least_and_inflationary_fixed-point_logic","267086703_Some_Classes_of_Recursive_Functions","266592690_Semantical_Considerations_on_Modal_Logic","266443774_Decidability_of_second-order_theories_and_automata_on_infinite_trees","265497993_Programming_languages_and_their_definition_Selected_papers_ed_by_C_B_Jones","240289415_The_lu-calculus_alternation_hierarchy_is_strict_on_binary_trees","234804942_Improved_upper_and_lower_bounds_for_modal_logics_of_programs","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","230875918_Formal_Properties_of_Grammars","229707853_Reduction_of_second-order_logic_to_modal_logic","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","226906547_The_temporal_logic_of_branching_time","225854320_Arity_and_alternation_A_proper_hierarchy_in_higher_order_logics","225544261_Specification_and_verification_of_concurrent_systems_in_CESAR","223713225_A_recognition_and_parsing_algorithm_for_arbitrary_conjunctive_grammars","223257822_Backtracking_Games_and_Inflationary_Fixed_Points","222973089_Theory_of_o-languagesI_Characterizations_of_o-context-free_languages","222838756_The_alternation_hierarchy_in_fixpoint_logic_with_chop_is_strict_too","222668328_Propositional_dynamic_logic_of_context-free_programs_and_fixpoint_logic_with_chop","222645366_Model_checking_propositional_dynamic_logic_with_all_extras","222504823_Deciding_the_winner_in_parity_games_is_in_UP_co-UP","222469166_Fixed-point_extensions_of_first-order_logic","222460749_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Nonregular_Programs","222445026_CTL_and_ECTL_as_fragments_of_the_modal_m-calculus","222437049_Using_Branching_Time_Temporal_Logic_to_Synthesize_Synchronization_Skeletons","222436986_Modalities_for_model_checking_Branching_time_strikes_back","222384214_Uniform_inevitability_is_tree_automation_ineffable","222261262_Decision_Procedures_and_Expressiveness_in_the_Temporal_Logic_of_Branching_Time","222191456_Recognition_and_Parsing_of_Context_Free_Languages_in_Time_n3","221653076_Temporal_Logic_with_Fixed_Points","221591301_Decision_Procedures_and_Expressiveness_in_the_Temporal_Logic_of_Branching_Time","221590647_A_Practical_Decision_Method_for_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_Preliminary_Report","221403378_Symbolic_Model_Checking","220997745_A_Really_Abstract_Concurrent_Model_and_its_Temporal_Logic","220995294_A_Modal_Fixpoint_Logic_with_Chop","220975567_The_Complexity_of_Model_Checking_Higher_Order_Fixpoint_Logic","220896827_Results_on_the_Propositional_m-Calculus","220852318_Practical_Model-Checking_Using_Games","220700608_Local_Model_Checking_Games_for_Fixed_Point_Logic_with_Chop","220676544_On_one-pass_CPS_transformations","220618274_Alternating_Pushdown_and_Stack_Automata","220618161_The_Complexity_of_Tree_Automata_and_Logics_of_Programs","220613498_Inflationary_fixed_points_in_modal_logic","220575001_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Regular_Programs"]}
