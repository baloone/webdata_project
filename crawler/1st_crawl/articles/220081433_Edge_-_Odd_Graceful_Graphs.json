{"id":"220081433_Edge_-_Odd_Graceful_Graphs","abstract":"Graph labeling of a graph was introduced by Rosa [A. Rosa, “Theory of graphs” (International Symposium, Rome, July 1966), Gordon and Breach, N. Y. and Dunod Paris (1967) 349-355] and the concept of an edge graceful labeling was introduced by Lo [S. Lo, “On edge graceful labeling of graphs”, Congress Numer., 50(1985) 231-241]. We introduced a new type of labeling called an edge - odd graceful labeling (EOGL)[A. Solairaju and K. Chithra, “Edge-Odd graceful labeling of some graphs”, proceedings of the ICMCS, Vol.1, 101-107(2008)]. In this paper, we proved that the Edge - Odd Graceful Labeling of some graphs.","authors":["A.
