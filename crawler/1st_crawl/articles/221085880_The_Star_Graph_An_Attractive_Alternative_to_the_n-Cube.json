{"id":"221085880_The_Star_Graph_An_Attractive_Alternative_to_the_n-Cube","abstract":"The authors introduce an interconnection topology called the star graph, and compare it to the widely used n-cube. Like the n-cube, the star graph is shown to possess rich structure and symmetry properties as well as many desirable fault-tolerant characteristics. With regard to the properties of degree and diameter the star graph is shown to be markedly superior. A number of optimal algorithms on the star graph that exploit its versatility are presented and analyzed. The inherent simplicity of the n-cube is weighted against the indicated advantages of the star graph.","authors":["Sheldon B.
