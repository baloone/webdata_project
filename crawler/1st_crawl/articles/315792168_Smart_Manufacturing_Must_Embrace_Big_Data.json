{"id":"315792168_Smart_Manufacturing_Must_Embrace_Big_Data","abstract":"Manufacturing is getting smart. Companies are increasingly using sensors and wireless technologies to capture data at all stages of a product’s life. These range from material properties and the temperatures and vibrations of equipment to the logistics of supply chains and customer details. But big data is a long way from transforming manufacturing. Leading industries — computing, energy, aircraft and semiconductor manufacturing — face data gaps. Most companies do not know what to do with the data they have, let alone how to interpret them to improve their processes and products. Smart manufacturing can make industry more efficient, profitable and sustainable.","authors":["Andrew Kusiak"],"meta":["April 2017Nature 544(7648):23-25","DOI:10.1038/544023a","Project: Smart Manufacturing"],"references":["273898861_Intelligent_Manufacturing_Systems","6601982_Organic_materials_for_printed_electronics"]}
