{"id":"347967440_Resource_prioritization_and_balancing_for_the_quantum_internet","abstract":"The quantum Internet enables networking based on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Here, methods and procedures of resource prioritization and resource balancing are defined for the quantum Internet. We define a model for resource consumption optimization in quantum repeaters, and a strongly-entangled network structure for resource balancing. We study the resource-balancing efficiency of the strongly-entangled structure. We prove that a strongly-entangled quantum network is two times more efficient in a resource balancing problem than a full-mesh network of the traditional Internet.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["December 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-78960-5"],"references":["349644025_Scalable_distributed_gate-model_quantum_computers","349205834_Quantum_capacity_analysis_of_multi-level_amplitude_damping_channels","347443328_Surpassing_the_classical_limit_in_magic_square_game_with_distant_quantum_dots_coupled_to_optical_cavities","347427245_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Key_Distribution","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","347177155_Capacity_Requirements_in_Networks_of_Quantum_Repeaters_and_Terminals","348439430_Quantum_networking_with_short-range_entanglement_assistance","347823869_Designing_a_quantum_network_protocol","347050336_A_Derivative-Free_Method_for_Quantum_Perceptron_Training_in_Multi-layered_Neural_Networks","346817049_Improved_quantum_state_tomography_for_systems_with_X_X_Y_Y_couplings_and_Z_readouts"]}
