{"id":"259089804_The_oriented_chromatic_number_of_Halin_graphs","abstract":"The oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph G is the minimum order of an oriented graph H such that G admits a homomorphism to H. The oriented chromatic number of an unoriented graph G is the maximal chromatic number over all possible orientations of G. In this paper, we prove that every Halin graph has oriented chromatic number at most 8, improving a previous bound by Hosseini Dolama and Sopena, and confirming the conjecture given by Vignal.","authors":["Janusz Dybizbański","Andrzej Szepietowski"],"meta":["February 2014Information Processing Letters 114(s 1–2):45–49","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2013.09.011"],"references":["229796797_The_Chromatic_Number_of_Oriented_Graphs","223407417_On_the_oriented_chromatic_number_of_Halin_graphs","222469370_Good_and_semi-strong_colorings_of_oriented_planar_graphs","222119444_On_the_oriented_chromatic_number_of_graphs_with_given_excess","2569364_A_Note_on_the_Oriented_Chromatic_Number_of_Graphs_with_Maximum_Degree_Three","2565260_On_the_Maximum_Average_Degree_and_the_Oriented_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","2363177_There_Exist_Oriented_Planar_Graphs_with_Oriented_Chromatic_Number_at_Least_Sixteen","2283664_Oriented_Graph_Coloring","2282034_Acyclic_and_Oriented_Chromatic_Numbers_of_Graphs","268547741_On_homogeneous_tournaments","240948501_The_oriented_chromatic_number_of_some_grids","222558633_On_the_oriented_chromatic_number_of_grids","222057157_A_note_on_the_oriented_chromatic_number_of_grids","220110909_Oriented_chromatic_number_of_grids_is_greater_than_7"]}
