{"id":"307913736_A_New_Energy_Prediction_Algorithm_for_Energy-Harvesting_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_With_Q-Learning","abstract":"Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face the problem of a limited-energy source, typically batteries, resulting in the need for careful and effective utilization of the energy source. However, inevitable energy depletion will eventually disturb the operation of a WSN. Energy harvesting (EH) technology is acquiring particular interest because it has the potential to provide a continuous energy supply in battery-powered WSNs. Solar energy is the most effective environmental energy for EH-WSNs because of its high energy intensity which comes from a non-controllable source. Therefore, the prediction of future energy availability is a critical issue as the amount of the harvestable energy may vary over time. In this paper, a novel solar energy prediction algorithm with Q-learning, called QL-SEP, is proposed. Q-learning is an effective way of predicting future actions based on past observations. The distinctive feature of QL-SEP is that not only past daysâ€™ observations but also the current weather conditions are taken into consideration for prediction. The performance of QL-SEP is simulated in this paper using real-world measurements obtained from a solar panel in comparison with state-of-art approaches.","authors":["Selahattin Kosunalp"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2606541"],"references":["281360971_MAC_Protocols_for_Energy_Harvesting_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","279409366_ERI-MAC_An_energy-harvested_receiver-initiated_MAC_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","262403082_Pro-Energy_A_novel_energy_prediction_model_for_solar_and_wind_energy-harvesting_wireless_sensor_networks","312853370_Power_management_in_energy_harvesting_sensor_networks","274067011_Experimental_Study_of_Capture_Effect_for_Medium_Access_Control_with_ALOHA","272161307_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction","264047986_Implications_of_diurnal_and_seasonal_variations_in_renewable_energy_generation_for_large_scale_energy_storage","261168649_Probabilistic_polling_for_multi-hop_energy_harvesting_wireless_sensor_networks","260710169_The_Evaluation_of_MAC_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","257489339_Power_management_in_SMAC-based_energy-harvesting_wireless_sensor_networks_using_queuing_analysis"]}
