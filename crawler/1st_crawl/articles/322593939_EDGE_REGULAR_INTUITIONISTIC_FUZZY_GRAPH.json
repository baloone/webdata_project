{"id":"322593939_EDGE_REGULAR_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_GRAPH","abstract":"In this paper, some properties of an edge regular intuitionistic fuzzy graph (IFG) are given and the relationship between degree of a vertex and degree of an edge in intuitionistic fuzzy graph is studied. The condition under which edge regular IFG and totally edge regular IFG are equivalent is provided. Also, we introduce a partially edge regular intuitionistic fuzzy graph and fully edge regular intuitionistic fuzzy graph with suitable illustrations.","authors":["M. G.
