{"id":"304526053_Faces_and_dual_of_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","abstract":"Recently, Ghorai and Pal [12] introduced the notion of m-polar fuzzy planar graphs using the concept of m-polar fuzzy multisets. In this paper, m-polar fuzzy faces and strong m-polar fuzzy faces are defined. Then m-polar fuzzy dual graph of an m-polar fuzzy planar graph is introduced with example. Some isomorphism properties of m-polar fuzzy planar graphs are also studied.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 31(3):2043-2049","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-16433","Project: Fuzzy graph"],"references":["312092976_FUZZY_DUAL_GRAPH","304525757_Some_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","283070761_Product_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","283005097_On_some_operations_and_density_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","292143739_Product_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_degree","291629985_Semi_Global_Domination_Sets_in_Vague_Graphs_with_Application","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","282765879_More_Results_on_Vague_Graphs","281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","281336888_Domination_in_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
