{"id":"270222536_Attacks_exploiting_deviation_of_mean_photon_number_in_quantum_key_distribution_and_coin-tossing","abstract":"The security of quantum communication using a weak coherent source requires\nan accurate knowledge of the source's mean photon number. Finite calibration\nprecision or an active manipulation by an attacker may cause the actual emitted\nphoton number to deviate from the known value. We model effects of this\ndeviation on the security of three quantum communication protocols: the\nBennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol without\ndecoy states, Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) QKD protocol, and a\ncoin-tossing protocol. For QKD, we model both a strong attack using technology\npossible in principle, and a realistic attack bounded by today's technology. To\nmaintain the mean photon number in two-way systems, such as plug-and-play and\nrelativistic quantum cryptography schemes, bright pulse energy incoming from\nthe communication channel must be monitored. Implementation of a monitoring\ndetector has largely been ignored so far, except for ID Quantique's commercial\nQKD system Clavis2. We scrutinize this implementation for security problems,\nand show that designing a hack-proof pulse-energy-measuring detector is far\nfrom trivial. Indeed the first implementation has three serious flaws confirmed\nexperimentally, each of which may be exploited in a cleverly constructed\nTrojan-horse attack. We discuss requirements for a loophole-free implementation\nof the monitoring detector.","authors":["Shihan Sajeed","Igor Radchenko","Sarah Kaiser","Jean-Philippe Bourgoin"],"meta":["December 2014Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 91(3)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.91.032326","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261837367_Experimental_plugplay_quantum_coin_flipping","260800061_Relativistic_Quantum_Cryptography","260440238_Laser_Damage_Helps_the_Eavesdropper_in_Quantum_Cryptography","255825105_Trojan-horse_attacks_on_quantum-key-distribution_systems","242607752_Quantum_Key_Distribution_over_67_km_with_a_plug_play_system","235533975_Effect_of_finite_detector_efficiencies_on_the_security_evaluation_of_quantum_key_distribution","312685416_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","258695418_Security_proof_of_the_unbalanced_phase-encoded_Bennett-Brassard_1984_protocol","258082337_Squashing_model_for_detectors_and_applications_to_quantum_key_distribution_protocols","252679937_Large_pulse_attack_as_a_method_of_conventional_optical_eavesdropping_in_quantum_cryptography"]}
