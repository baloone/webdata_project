{"id":"266311224_Spectral_density_estimation_for_stationary_stable_random_fields","abstract":"We consider a stationary symmetric stable bidimensional process with discrete time, having the spectral representation X(n,m)=∫ -π π ∫ -π π e i(λ 1 n+λ 2 m) dξ(λ 1 ,λ 2 ), where ξ is a symmetric α-stable (S·α·S) process with independent isotropic increments; that means ξ is an additive complex function defined on the Borel subsets of [-π,π] 2 such that: for any integer k and any Borel sets B 1 ,⋯,B k , (ξ(B 1 ),⋯,ξ(B k )) is (S·α·S); for any integer k and any disjoint Borel sets B 1 ,⋯,B k , ξ(B 1 ),⋯,ξ(B k ) are complex (S·α·S) independent random variables; for all Borel sets B, the distribution of the random variable e iθ ξ(B) is independent of θ. We consider a general case where the spectral measure is assumed to be the sum of an absolutely continuous measure, a discrete measure of finite order and a finite number of absolutely continuous measures on several lines. We estimate the density of the absolutely continuous measure and the density on the lines.","authors":["Rachid Sabre"],"meta":["January 1995Applicationes Mathematicae 23(2)","DOI:10.4064/am-23-2-107-133"],"references":[]}
