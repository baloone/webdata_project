{"id":"342420693_PHONETIC_TOOL_FOR_THE_TUNISIAN_ARABIC","abstract":"A phonetic dictionary is an essential component of a speech recognition system or a speech synthesis system. Our work targets the generation of an automatic pronunciation dictionary for the Tunisian Arabic, in particular in the field of rail transport. To do this, we created two tools of phonetic vowelized and unvowelized words in the Tunisian Arabic. The proposed method to automatically generate phonetic dictionaries is based on rules and is presented in this article. This paper outlines the steps to create our own study corpus T TA AR RI IC C: T Tunisian A Arabic R Railway I Interaction C Corpus[1]. Then it details the phonetic and phonological exceptions of the Tunisian Arabic and illustrates some rules used for the construction of phonetic dictionary.","authors":["Abir Masmoudi","Yannick Est√®ve","Mariem Ellouze Khmekhem","Fethi Bougares"],"meta":["June 2020","Conference: SLTU 2014"],"references":["224312452_Phonetic_pronunciations_for_Arabic_speech-to-text_systems","221483907_Grapheme_to_phoneme_conversion_using_an_SMT_system","220816863_Improving_the_Arabic_Pronunciation_Dictionary_for_Phone_and_Word_Recognition_with_Linguistically-Based_Pronunciation_Rules","4311015_Development_of_a_phonetic_system_for_large_vocabulary_Arabic_speech_recognition","333033978_Arabic_in_the_North_African_Region","283551042_LIA_PHON_Un_systeme_complet_de_phonetisation_de_textes","222681651_Joint-Sequence_Models_for_Grapheme-to-Phoneme_Conversion"]}
