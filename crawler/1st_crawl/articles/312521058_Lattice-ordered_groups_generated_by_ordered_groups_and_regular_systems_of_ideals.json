{"id":"312521058_Lattice-ordered_groups_generated_by_ordered_groups_and_regular_systems_of_ideals","abstract":"Unbounded entailment relations, introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1951), are a slight variant of a notion which plays a fundamental r{\\^o}le in logic (see Scott 1974) and in algebra (see Lombardi and Quitt{\\'e} 2015). We propose to define systems of ideals for a commutative ordered monoid G as unbounded single-conclusion entailment relations that preserve its order and are equivariant: they describe all morphisms from G to meet-semilattice-ordered monoids generated by (the image of) G. Taking an article by Lorenzen (1953) as a starting point, we also describe all morphisms from a commutative ordered group G to lattice-ordered groups generated by G through unbounded entailment relations that preserve its order, are equivariant, and satisfy a \"regularity\" property invented by Lorenzen (1950); we call them regular systems of ideals. In particular, the free lattice-ordered group generated by G is described by the finest regular system of ideals for G, and we provide an explicit description for it; it is order-reflecting if and only if the morphism is injective, so that the Lorenzen-Clifford-Dieudonn\\'e theorem fits in our framework. In fact, Lorenzen's research in algebra is motivated by the system of Dedekind ideals for the divisibility group of an integral domain R; in particular, we provide an explicit description of the lattice-ordered group granted by Wolfgang Krull's \"Fundamentalsatz\" if (and only if) R is integrally closed as the \"regularisation\" of the Dedekind system of ideals.","authors":["Thierry Coquand","Henrri Lombardi","Stefan Neuwirth"],"meta":["January 2017Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics 49(5)","DOI:10.1216/RMJ-2019-49-5-1449"],"references":["280033892_Anneaux_a_diviseurs_et_anneaux_de_Krull_une_approche_constructive","258516222_Lattice_Theory_Foundation","317773817_ELIMINATING_DISJUNCTIONS_BY_DISJUNCTION_ELIMINATION","288263318_Sur_la_theorie_de_la_divisibilite","275981786_Les_Systemes_d'ideaux","270309724_A_Course_in_Constructive_Algebra","268774741_Algebraic_theory_of_numbers","268732719_Partially_ordered_abelian_groups","267168138_The_Collected_Papers_of_Gerhard_Gentzen","266061552_Elements_of_mathematics_Commutative_algebra_Chapter_10","265620351_Divisor_Theory","265577271_Commutative_algebra_Constructive_methods_Finite_type_projective_modules","257283093_Foundations_of_Constructive_Analysis","255618812_Les_Axiomes_de_Tarski","251331750_Uber_Axiomensysteme_fur_beliebige_Satzsysteme","246086442_Ergebnisse_der_Mathematik_und_ihrer_Grenzgebiete_76","243677769_Varieties_of_Constructive_Mathematics","242976589_Teilbarkeitstheorie_in_Bereichen","242976491_Die_Erweiterung_halbgeordneter_Gruppen_zu_Verbandsgruppen","238881220_Untersuchungen_uber_Teilbarkeitseigenschaften_in_Korpern","226579258_Uber_die_Existenz_unabhangiger_Axiomensysteme_zu_unendlichen_Satzsystemen","226211074_Abstrakte_Begrundung_der_multiplikativen_Idealtheorie","225515695_Uber_halbgeordnete_Gruppen","222531830_Dynamical_method_in_algebra_Effective_Nullstellensatze","220315598_Algebraische_und_Logistische_Untersuchungen_Uber_Freie_Verbande","44345691_A_course_in_constructive_algebra_Ray_Mines_Fred_Richman_Wim_Ruitenburg"]}
