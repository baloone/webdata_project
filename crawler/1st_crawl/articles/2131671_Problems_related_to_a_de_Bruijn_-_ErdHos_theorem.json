{"id":"2131671_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn_-_ErdHos_theorem","abstract":"De Bruijn and Erd\\H{o}s proved that every noncollinear set of n points in the plane determines at least n distinct lines. We suggest a possible generalization of this theorem in the framework of metric spaces and provide partial results on related extremal combinatorial problems. Comment: 11 pages.
