{"id":"332810713_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_In_Brazilian_Schools_With_Social_And_Economic_Vulnerability_How_To_Teach_Computer_Science_Without_Machines","abstract":"Computational Thinking (CT) has been placing the focus of educational innovation as a set of troubleshooting skills. Unfortunately, there is not a consensus if the teaching methodology and the available materials attend the expectations of the lecturers. To prove the impact that CT training has in primary school, we attempted to evaluate primary school students with a Quasi-Experimental approach and taking Unplugged CT classes in Brazilian Schools with Social and Economic Vulnerabilities. The research happened in two schools to prove if the activities are effective for students who live in areas where there are no electronic devices, Internet or even electrical power can be also benefited. The results show statistically significant improvement. Our study finds shows that we are able to reinforce the claim that CS unplugged is an effective approach and it is an alternative for students who live in unprivileged areas.","authors":["Christian Puhlmann Brackmann","Dante Barone","Rafael Marimon Boucinha","Janice Teresinha Reichert"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal for Innovation Education and Research 7(4):79-96","DOI:10.31686/ijier.Vol7.Iss4.1390","Project: Computational Thinking"],"references":["332587200_Um_Relato_de_Experiencias_de_Estagiarios_da_Licenciatura_em_Computacao_com_o_Ensino_de_Computacao_para_Criancas","320884563_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_through_Unplugged_Activities_in_Primary_School","318469859_Complementary_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_Assessment","314296105_Measuring_Student_Learning_in_Introductory_Block-Based_Programming_Examining_Misconceptions_of_Loops_Variables_and_Boolean_Logic","314293221_Using_Upper-Elementary_Student_Performance_to_Understand_Conceptual_Sequencing_in_a_Blocks-based_Curriculum","310807767_Computational_thinking_Panorama_of_the_Americas","320789006_Desenvolvendo_o_Raciocinio_Logico_e_o_Pensamento_Computacional_Experiencias_no_Contexto_do_Projeto_Logicando","316948805_Assessing_Computational_Thinking_in_CS_Unplugged_Activities","308654282_Which_cognitive_abilities_underlie_computational_thinking_Criterion_validity_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Test","305726775_Of_Elephants_and_Nested_Loops_How_to_Introduce_Computing_to_Youth_in_Rural_India"]}
