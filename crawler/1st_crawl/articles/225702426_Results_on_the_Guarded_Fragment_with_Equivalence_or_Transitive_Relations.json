{"id":"225702426_Results_on_the_Guarded_Fragment_with_Equivalence_or_Transitive_Relations","abstract":"We study the problem of the satisfiability of guarded formulas in models in which some distinguished binary symbols are interpreted\nas equivalence relations or as transitive relations. We sharpen the undecidability result for the two-variable guarded fragment\nwith transitive relations by reducing the number of transitive relations to two. We prove that the satisfiability problem\nfor the two-variable guarded fragment with two equivalence relations is 2EXPTIME-complete. We consider the guarded fragment\nwith equivalence relations in guards and show that this variant is easily reducible to the variant with transitive relations\nin guards. However, in the case of two variables, the version with equivalence relations is easier: NEXPTIME-complete. Finally\nwe show that the decidability results for the guarded fragment with either equivalence relations or transitive relations in\nguards cannot be generalized to the loosely guarded fragment.","authors":["Emanuel Kieronski"],"meta":["September 2005","DOI:10.1007/11538363_22","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computer Science Logic"],"references":["263249149_Modal_Languages_and_Bounded_Fragments_of_Predicate_Logic","221570314_The_two-variable_guarded_fragment_with_transitive_guards_is_2EXPTIME-hard","3902857_On_the_decision_problem_for_the_guarded_fragment_with_transitivity","2454980_On_the_Decision_Problem_for_Two-Variable_First-Order_Logic","225997902_Undecidability_results_on_two-variable_logics","222770246_Complexity_results_for_classes_of_quantificational_formulas","222026259_On_logics_with_two_variables","220994756_EXPSPACE-Complete_Variant_of_Guarded_Fragment_with_Transitivity","220994331_Counting_in_the_Two_Variable_Guarded_Logic_with_Transitivity","220394847_The_guarded_fragment_with_transitive_guards","220315408_On_The_Restraining_Power_of_Guards","4175443_Small_Substructures_and_Decidability_Issues_for_First-Order_Logic_with_Two_Variables","3811878_Two-variable_guarded_fragment_with_transitive_relations","3811857_Guarded_Fixed_Point_Logic","2455092_Two_Variable_First-Order_Logic_over_Ordered_Domains","2253569_Dynamic_Bits_And_Pieces"]}
