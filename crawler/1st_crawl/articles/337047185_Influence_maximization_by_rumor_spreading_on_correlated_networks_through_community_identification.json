{"id":"337047185_Influence_maximization_by_rumor_spreading_on_correlated_networks_through_community_identification","abstract":"The identification of the minimal set of nodes that maximizes the propagation of information is one of the most relevant problems in network science. In this paper, we introduce a new method to find the set of initial spreaders to maximize the information propagation in complex networks. We evaluate this method in assortative networks and verify that degree-degree correlation plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics. Simulation results show that our algorithm is statistically similar, regarding the average size of outbreaks, to the greedy approach in real-world networks. However, our method is much less time consuming than the greedy algorithm.","authors":["Didier Augusto Vega-Oliveros","Luciano da F.
