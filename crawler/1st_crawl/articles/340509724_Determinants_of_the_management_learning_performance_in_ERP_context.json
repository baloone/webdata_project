{"id":"340509724_Determinants_of_the_management_learning_performance_in_ERP_context","abstract":"Management learning poses some challenges, firstly students should identify all administration areas and secondly, they should understand the big picture of an organizational context, by integrating all the studied areas. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are the backbone of any organization, in terms of information management systems integration. The usage of these systems is important in terms of management in any organization, and ERP's can facilitate the management learning process. The main objectives of this study are to understand if the ERP usage supports management learning, and to identify the main determinants of individual performance. This study presents a success model of ERP usage for learning management context. The model was validated empirically through a survey answered by university management students. The results show that system quality, process quality, and training play a determinant role in the students' performance.","authors":["Carlos J.
