{"id":"346317296_Use_of_artificial_intelligence_in_improving_adenoma_detection_rate_during_colonoscopy_Might_both_endoscopists_and_pathologists_be_further_helped","abstract":"Colonoscopy remains the standard strategy for screening for colorectal cancer around the world due to its efficacy in both detecting adenomatous or precancerous lesions and the capacity to remove them intra-procedurally. Computeraided detection and diagnosis (CAD), thanks to the brand new developed innovations of artificial intelligence, and especially deep-learning techniques, leads to a promising solution to human biases in performance by guarantying decision support during colonoscopy. The application of CAD on real-time colonoscopy helps increasing the adenoma detection rate, and therefore contributes to reduce the incidence of interval cancers improving the effectiveness of colonoscopy screening on critical outcome such as colorectal cancer related mortality. Furthermore, a significant reduction in costs is also expected. In addition, the assistance of the machine will lead to a reduction of the examination time and therefore an optimization of the endoscopic schedule. The aim of this opinion review is to analyze the clinical applications of CAD and artificial intelligence in colonoscopy, as it is reported in literature, addressing evidence, limitations, and future prospects.","authors":["Emanuele Sinagra","Francesca Rossi","Giuseppe Conoscenti","Dario Raimondo"],"meta":["October 2020World Journal of Gastroenterology 26(39):5911-5918","DOI:10.3748/wjg.v26.i39.5911"],"references":["338770459_Effect_of_a_deep-learning_computer-aided_detection_system_on_adenoma_detection_during_colonoscopy_CADe-DB_trial_a_double-blind_randomised_study","338567296_Use_of_artificial_intelligence-based_analytics_from_live_colonoscopies_to_optimize_the_quality_of_the_colonoscopy_exam_in_real-time_proof_of_concept","338258505_Study_on_detection_rate_of_polyps_and_adenomas_in_artificial-intelligence-aided_colonoscopy","332030113_Estimation_of_Invasion_Depth_The_First_Key_to_Successful_Colorectal_ESD","331391835_Real-time_automatic_detection_system_increases_colonoscopic_polyp_and_adenoma_detection_rates_A_prospective_randomised_controlled_study","330236261_Quality_measures_improving_endoscopic_screening_of_colorectal_cancer_a_review_of_the_literature","328318053_Artificial_intelligence_in_gastrointestinal_endoscopy_The_future_is_almost_here","324451313_Artificial_Intelligence-Assisted_Polyp_Detection_for_Colonoscopy_Initial_Experience","322101711_Optical_Diagnosis_for_Colorectal_Polyps_A_Useful_Technique_Now_or_in_the_Future","320356074_Screening_of_colorectal_cancer_present_and_future","301538975_Narrow_band_imaging_optical_diagnosis_of_small_colorectal_polyps_in_routine_clinical_practice_the_Detect_Inspect_Characterise_Resect_and_Discard_2_DISCARD_2_study","277342728_The_Global_Burden_of_Cancer_2013","234086095_An_Endoscopic_Quality_Improvement_Program_Improves_Detection_of_Colorectal_Adenomas","341094874_Efficacy_of_Real-Time_Computer-Aided_Detection_of_Colorectal_Neoplasia_in_a_Randomized_Trial","338773722_Detection_of_colorectal_adenomas_with_a_real-time_computer-aided_system_ENDOANGEL_a_randomised_controlled_study","338550103_Artificial_intelligence_in_gastrointestinal_endoscopy_General_overview","336573338_New_artificial_intelligence_system_First_validation_study_versus_experienced_endoscopists_for_colorectal_polyp_detection","332007595_Quality_Assurance_of_Computer-Aided_Detection_and_Diagnosis_in_Colonoscopy","331003715_Efficacy_of_Per-oral_Methylene_Blue_Formulation_for_Screening_Colonoscopy","330942797_Magnitude_Risk_Factors_and_Factors_Associated_With_Adenoma_Miss_Rate_of_Tandem_Colonoscopy_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis","330060080_Artificial_intelligence_and_computer-aided_diagnosis_in_colonoscopy_current_evidence_and_future_directions","328300697_Human-machine_Collaboration_Bringing_Artificial_Intelligence_Into_Colonoscopy","327022255_Real-Time_Use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Identification_of_Diminutive_Polyps_During_Colonoscopy_A_Prospective_Study","324732724_Endoscopist_factors_that_influence_serrated_polyp_detection_a_multicenter_study","320762540_Will_Computer-Aided_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Revolutionize_Colonoscopy","318257495_Adenoma_detection_rate_and_risk_of_colorectal_cancer","305922185_Impact_of_an_automated_system_for_endocytoscopic_diagnosis_of_small_colorectal_lesions_an_international_web-based_study","300408292_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_with_3D_Convolutional_Networks","299457141_In_vivo_real-time_assessment_of_colorectal_polyp_histology_using_an_optical_biopsy_forceps_system_based_on_laser-induced_fluorescence_spectroscopy","281084061_Computer-aided_diagnosis_of_colorectal_polyp_histology_by_using_a_real-time_image_recognition_system_and_narrow-band_imaging_magnifying_colonoscopy","279014920_Adenoma_Detection_Rate_and_Risk_of_Colorectal_Cancer_and_Death_REPLY","276137975_626_In_Vivo_Real-Time_Assessment_of_Colorectal_Polyp_Histology_Using_an_Optical_Biopsy_Forceps_System_Based_on_LASER-Induced_Spectroscopy","274566622_Global_Cancer_Statistic_2012","269171503_Quality_Indicators_for_Colonoscopy","266264836_Automatic_optical_diagnosis_of_small_colorectal_lesions_by_laser-induced_autofluorescence","261325436_Adenoma_Detection_Rate_and_Risk_of_Colorectal_Cancer_and_Death","255955442_1144_The_Learning_Curve_for_Detection_of_Nonpolypoid_Flat_and_Depressed_Colorectal_Neoplasms","233948337_Computer-aided_diagnosis_of_neoplastic_colorectal_lesions_using_'real-time'_numerical_color_analysis_during_autofluorescence_endoscopy","14723827_Reducing_Mortality_from_Colorectal_Cancer_by_Screening_for_Fecal_Occult_Blood","14230294_Colonoscopic_miss_rates_of_adenomas_determined_by_back-to-back_colonoscopies"]}
