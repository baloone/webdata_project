{"id":"340153350_Blood_transfusion_prediction_using_restricted_Boltzmann_machines","abstract":"The availability of blood transfusion has been a recurrent concern for medical institutions and patients. Efficient management of this resource represents an important challenge for many hospitals. Likewise, rapid reaction during transfusion decisions and planning is a critical factor to maximize patient care. This paper proposes a novel strategy for predicting the blood transfusion need, based on available information, by means of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). By extracting and analyzing high-level features from 4831 patient records, RBM can deal with complex patterns recognition, helping supervised classifiers in the task of automatic identification of blood transfusion requirements. Results show that a successfully classification is obtained (96.85%), based only on available information from the patient records.","authors":["Jenny Alexandra Cifuentes Quintero","Yuanyuan Yao","Min Yan","Bin Zheng"],"meta":["March 2020Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering 23(10):1-8","DOI:10.1080/10255842.2020.1742709","Project: Clinical outcome assessment"],"references":["336990435_Blood_Donation_Prediction_using_Artificial_Neural_Network","336407878_Computer_algorithm_can_match_physicians'_decisions_about_blood_transfusions","328947201_Improvements_in_blood_transfusion_management_Cross-sectional_data_analysis_from_nine_hospitals_in_Zhejiang_China","326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","339022085_Predicting_Risk_of_Hospital_Readmission_for_Comorbidity_Patients_through_a_Novel_Deep_Learning_Framework","338328957_965_Can_a_deep-learning_approach_predict_the_need_for_postpartum_transfusion_by_mode_of_delivery","338085389_Techniques_for_interpretable_machine_learning","328670539_Efficacy_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_for_Blood_Transfusion_Prediction_in_Patients_Undergoing_Myomectomy","327945896_Machine_learning_for_real-time_prediction_of_complications_in_critical_care_a_retrospective_study","317587261_Development_of_Multivariable_Models_to_Predict_and_Benchmark_Transfusion_in_Elective_Surgery_Supporting_Patient_Blood_Management"]}
