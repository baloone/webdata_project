{"id":"341602825_A_novel_decision-making_model_for_sustainable_supply_chain_finance_under_uncertainty_environment","abstract":"Earlier studies in the sustainable supply chain (SSC) have been introduced since its submission, yet, research of sustainable supply chain finance (SSCF) is still insufficient. Also, these studies did not consider uncertainty in corresponding with the uncertain environment of the supply chain deficiencies, the integration of sustainable development and supply chain finance is essential. Hence, this paper evaluating a set of measurements to provide sustainable supply chain finance in the gas industry under uncertainty. In this paper, TODIM (acronym in Portuguese for Interactive and Multi-criteria Decision-Making) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods based on the Best-Worst Method (BWM) will be applied according to neutrosophic set to increase the accuracy of evaluation under uncertainty. According to expert evaluations, the results show that financial attributes and product/service management are the most substantial metrics for enhancing a firm's performance and obtain sustainable supply chain finance. Moreover, obtain price and cost information, consider product/service level, technology management, and demand management are important to build sustainable supply chain management.","authors":["Mohamed Abdel-Basset","Rehab Mohamed","Karam M Sallam","Mohamed Elhoseny"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Cleaner Production
