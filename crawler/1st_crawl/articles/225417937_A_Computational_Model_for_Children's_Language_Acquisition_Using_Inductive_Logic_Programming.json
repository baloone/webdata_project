{"id":"225417937_A_Computational_Model_for_Children's_Language_Acquisition_Using_Inductive_Logic_Programming","abstract":"This paper describes our research activity on developing a computational model for children’s word acquisition using inductive\nlogic programming. We incorporate cognitive biases developed recently to explain the efficiency of children’s language acquisition.\nWe also design a co-evolution mechanism of acquiring concept definitions for words and developing concept hierarchy. Concept\nhierarchy plays an important roles of defining contexts for later word learning processes. A context switching mechanism is\nused to select relevant set of attributes for learning a word depending on the category which it belongs to. On the other\nhand, during acquiring definitions for words, concept hierarchy is developed. We developed an experimental language acquisition\nsystem called WISDOM (Word Induction System for Deriving Object Model) and conducted virtual experiments or simulations on\nacquisition of words in two different categories. The experiments shows feasibility of our approach.","authors":["Ikuo Kobayashi","Koichi Furukawa","Tomonobu Ozaki","Mutsumi Imai"],"meta":["March 2002","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45884-0_7","In book: Progress in Discovery Science (pp.305-326)"],"references":["246462403_Infants''knowledge_of_object_motion_and_human_action","240132493_Naming_and_Categorization_in_Children","239640722_Conceptual_Change_in_Childhood","227890792_Controlling_the_application_of_the_mutual_exclusivity_assumption_in_the_acquisition_of_lexical_hierarchies","222450581_First_Principles_Organize_Attention_to_and_Learning_About_Relevant_Data_Number_and_the_Animate-Inanimate_Distinction_as_Examples","2425607_Inverse_entailment_and_Progol"]}
