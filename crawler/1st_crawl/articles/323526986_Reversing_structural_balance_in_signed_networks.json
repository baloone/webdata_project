{"id":"323526986_Reversing_structural_balance_in_signed_networks","abstract":"The transformation of imbalanced networks into balanced ones has been widely studied, but the reverse transformation of balanced structure has received little attention. A balanced structure may sometimes reflect undesirable collective action, and breaking this balance could be socially beneficial. In this paper, we study the reverse transformation of balanced structure and propose a model for reversing structural balance. We suggest a greedy algorithm and a memetic algorithm that break structural balance by changing node attributes. Experiments show that our algorithms can produce this reversed structural balance quite efficiently.","authors":["Haifeng Du","Xiaochen He","Jingjing Wang","Marcus W Feldman"],"meta":["March 2018Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 503(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.194"],"references":["316821336_Statistical_Physics_of_Balance_Theory","287231587_Testing_two_theories_for_generating_signed_networks_using_real_data","284772346_An_analysis_of_the_Slovene_parliamentary_parties_network","271880689_Memetic_algorithms_and_memetic_computing_optimization_A_literature_review","269417830_Emergent_Complex_Network_Geometry","259180902_Transparency_Effect_in_the_Emergence_of_Monopolies_in_Social_Networks","248484742_Partitioning_Signed_Social_Networks","247743243_Social_Identity_and_Affect_as_Determinants_of_Collective_Action","241278734_Active_influence_in_dynamical_models_of_structural_balance_in_social_networks","234412355_Transparency_Effect_in_the_Emergence_of_Monopolies_in_Social_Networks","231001263_On_the_computational_complexity_of_Ising_spin_glass_models","230569436_Dynamical_Models_Explaining_Social_Balance_and_Evolution_of_Cooperation","224131319_Memetic_Computation-Past_Present_Future_Research_Frontier","200110353_Birds_of_a_Feather_Homophily_in_Social_Networks","51876876_Computing_global_structural_balance_in_large-scale_signed_social_networks","13215601_Strategies_to_Cope_With_Negative_Social_Identity_Predictions_by_Social_Identity_Theory_and_Relative_Deprivation_Theory","7524086_Dynamics_of_Social_Balance_on_Networks","7053713_Oda_K_Matsuoka_Y_Funahashi_A_Kitano_HA_comprehensive_pathway_map_of_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor_signaling_Mol_Sys_Biol_120050011","3297773_Community_mining_from_signed_social_networks_IEEE_Trans_Knowl_Data_Eng","2172173_The_Heider_balance_A_continuous_approach","324424703_The_Logic_of_Collective_Action_Public_Goods_and_the_Theory_of_Groups","324348130_The_Logic_of_Collective_Action_Public_Goods_and_the_Theory_of_Groups","316480233_Pseudo_paths_toward_minimum_energy_states_in_network_dynamics","308555378_An_integrative_theory_of_intergroup_conict","307556037_Optimizing_transformations_of_structural_balance_in_signed_networks_with_potential_relationships","297791217_Structural_balance_in_fully_signed_networks","283798305_Refining_Social_Graph_Connectivity_via_Shortcut_Edge_Addition","282928400_Optimizing_dynamical_changes_of_structural_balance_in_signed_network_based_on_memetic_algorithm","282408281_The_influence_of_structural_balance_and_homophilyheterophobia_on_the_adjustment_of_random_complete_signed_networks","281578022_Comprehensive_pathway_map_of_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor_signaling","281273960_An_Integrative_Theory_of_Intergroup_Conflict","281273813_A_Model_of_Egoistical_Relative_Deprivation","271744500_Dissident_Groups_Personal_Networks_and_Spontaneous_Cooperation_The_East_German_Revolution_of_1989","269980719_Relative_Deprivation_and_Social_Justice_A_Study_of_Attitudes_to_Social_Inequality_in_Twentieth-Century_England","265295735_Fast_computing_global_structural_balance_in_signed_networks_based_on_memetic_algorithm","240564934_The_Sociology_of_Conflict_II","239667025_The_Function_of_Social_Conflict","234021360_Exchange_Power_in_Social_Life","233870037_Resource_Mobilization_and_Social_Movements_A_Partial_Theory","233822040_Birds_of_a_Feather_Homophily_in_Social_Networks","232918057_Collective_action_Towards_a_dual-pathway_model","232477307_Clustering_and_Structural_Balance_in_Graphs","232458835_A_Model_of_Egoistic_Relative_Deprivation","230818214_Dynamic_Models_of_Segregation","224904917_A_greedy-navigator_approach_to_navigable_city_plans","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","47595554_Attitudes_and_Cognitive_Organization","43515411_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Psychological_Dynamics_of_Collective_Action","43021024_Energy_Landscape_of_Social_Balance","10206079_Structural_balance_A_generalization_of_Heider's_theory"]}
