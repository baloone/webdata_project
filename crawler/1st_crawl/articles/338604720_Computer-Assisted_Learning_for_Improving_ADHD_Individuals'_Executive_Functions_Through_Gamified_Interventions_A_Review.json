{"id":"338604720_Computer-Assisted_Learning_for_Improving_ADHD_Individuals'_Executive_Functions_Through_Gamified_Interventions_A_Review","abstract":"Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), specifically gamified interventions, is a promising intervention for people suffering from Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in terms of improving their life behavior, academic achievement, and self-control. Most of the studies showed improvement in ADHD individualsâ€™ engagement and motivation along with other skills the game targeted. They emphasized the importance of applying gamified interventions based on theoretical concepts. There is no survey that focuses on ADHD in relation to SG; this paper presents attempts to fill this gap. Using a literature review, this paper investigated the effects of Serious Games (SGs) on ADHD. Based on the analysis of several studies, this paper concludes that gamified intervention is a promising learning technique for improving the Executive Functions (EFs) for ADHD individuals; it can be used as a non-medical treatment alternative. This paper concludes with some recommendations for game creators.","authors":["Eatedal Alabdulakareem","Mona Jamjoom"],"meta":["March 2020Entertainment Computing 33:100341","DOI:10.1016/j.entcom.2020.100341"],"references":["333121613_A_Rule-Based_Method_for_Cognitive_Competency_Assessment_in_Computer_Programming_Using_Bloom's_Taxonomy","325522566_FOCUS_Detecting_ADHD_patients_by_an_EEG-based_serious_game","325446924_The_effect_of_automatic_assessment_on_novice_programming_Strengths_and_limitations_of_existing_systems","324453348_Attention_and_executive_functions_computer_training_for_attention-deficithyperactivity_disorder_ADHD_results_from_a_randomized_controlled_trial","323788951_Performance_test_for_prototype_game_for_children_with_adhd","317424818_More_attention_less_deficit_Wearable_EEG-based_serious_game_for_focus_improvement","305727043_Evaluating_the_ChillFish_Biofeedback_Game_with_Children_with_ADHD","286754952_Empowering_children_with_ADHD_learning_disabilities_with_the_Kinems_Kinect_learning_games","281520827_Development_and_User_Satisfaction_of_Plan-It_Commander_a_Serious_Game_for_Children_with_ADHD","279201134_A_Survey_of_Students_Participating_in_a_Computer-Assisted_Education_Programme","274629471_Improving_Executive_Functioning_in_Children_with_ADHD_Training_Multiple_Executive_Functions_within_the_Context_of_a_Computer_Game_A_Randomized_Double-Blind_Placebo_Controlled_Trial","263808460_A_Machine_Learning-Based_Analysis_of_Game_Data_for_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Assessment","259112690_The_Benefits_of_Playing_Video_Games","235734477_Braingame_Brian_Toward_an_Executive_Function_Training_Program_with_Game_Elements_for_Children_with_ADHD_and_Cognitive_Control_Problems","228419039_Can_children_with_ADHD_learn_relaxation_and_breathing_techniques_through_biofeedback_video_games","223986849_Distinct_neuropsychological_subgroups_in_typically_developing_youth_inform_heterogeneity_in_children_with_ADHD","220374763_The_Effectiveness_of_Computer-Assisted_Instruction_in_Teaching_Introductory_Statistics","26388622_An_Overview_of_Current_Research_on_Automated_Essay_Grading","330326744_Guidelines_to_Design_Tangible_Tabletop_Activities_for_Children_with_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder","329064604_Fairy_tale_directed_game-based_training_system_for_children_with_ADHD_using_BCI_and_motion_sensing_technologies","322560071_Neurofeedback_based_attention_training_for_children_with_ADHD","311574173_An_Investigation_of_Brain_Games_as_a_Potential_Non-Pharmaceutical_Alternative_for_the_Treatment_of_ADHD","311488303_ChillFish_A_Respiration_Game_for_Children_with_ADHD","270658611_Brain-computer_interface_using_P300_and_virtual_reality_A_gaming_approach_for_treating_ADHD","252025887_Brain_computer_interface_based_3D_game_for_attention_training_and_rehabilitation","242605045_Effects_of_computer_assisted_instruction_CAI_on_secondary_school_students'_performance_in_biology","236129376_Social_Interaction_Behavior_in_ADHD_in_Adults_in_a_Virtual_Trust_Game","235703112_Current_status_opportunities_and_challenges_of_augmented_reality_in_education","230645636_A_Pilot_Study_of_the_Efficacy_of_a_Computerized_Executive_Functioning_Remediation_Training_With_Game_Elements_for_Children_With_ADHD_in_an_Outpatient_Setting_Outcome_on_Parent-_and_TeacherRated_Execut","224249371_Assessment_of_ADHD_through_a_Computer_Game_An_Experiment_with_a_Sample_of_Students","221217350_The_Effects_of_a_Consumer-Oriented_Multimedia_Game_on_the_Reading_Disorders_of_Children_with_ADHD","7650808_Inhibition_ADHD_and_Computer_Games_The_Inhibitory_Performance_of_Children_with_ADHD_on_Computerized_Tasks_and_Games"]}
