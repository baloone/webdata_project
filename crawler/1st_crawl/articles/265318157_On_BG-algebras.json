{"id":"265318157_On_BG-algebras","abstract":"We introduce the notion of BG-algebras, which is a generalization of B-algebras. We construct a BG-algebra from a non-empty set, which is non-group-derived. Moreover, using the notion of normal subalgebra, we obtain several isomorphism theorems for BG-algebras and related properties.","authors":["Chang Bum Kim","Hee Sik Kim"],"meta":["September 2008Demonstratio Mathematica 41(3)","DOI:10.1515/dema-2013-0098"],"references":["265354706_An_introduction_to_theory_of_BCK-algebras"]}
