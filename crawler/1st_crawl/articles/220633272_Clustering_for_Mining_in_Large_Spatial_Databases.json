{"id":"220633272_Clustering_for_Mining_in_Large_Spatial_Databases","abstract":"In the past few decades, clustering has been widely used in areas such as pattern recognition, data analysis, and image proc- essing. Recently, clustering has been recognized as a primary data mining method for knowledge discovery in spatial data- bases, i.e. databases managing 2D or 3D points, polygons etc. or points in some d-dimensional feature space. The well-known clustering algorithms, however, have some drawbacks when applied to large spatial databases. First, they assume that all objects to be clustered reside in main memory. Second, these methods are too inefficient when applied to large databases. To overcome these limitations, new algorithms have been developed which are surveyed in this paper. These algorithms make use of efficient query processing techniques provided by spatial database systems.","authors":["Martin Ester","Hans-Peter Kriegel","Joerg Sander","Xiaowei Xu"],"meta":["January 1998","SourceDBLP"],"references":["3296625_Data_mining_An_overview_from_a_database_perspective","2689264_The_X-tree_An_Index_Structure_for_High-Dimensional_Data","243765083_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Spatial_Data_Structure"]}
