{"id":"334280964_Machines_as_Teammates_A_Research_Agenda_on_AI_in_Team_Collaboration","abstract":"What if artificial intelligence (AI) machines became teammates rather than tools? This paper reports on an international initiative by 65 collaboration scientists to develop a research agenda for exploring the potential risks and benefits of machines as teammates (MaT). They generated 819 research questions. A subteam of 12 converged them to a research agenda comprising three design areas – Machine artifact, Collaboration, and Institution – and 17 dualities – significant effects with the potential for benefit or harm. The MaT research agenda offers a structure and archetypal research questions to organize early thought and research in this new area of study.","authors":["Isabella Seeber","Eva Bittner","Robert Owen Briggs","Triparna de Vreede"],"meta":["July 2019Information & Management 57(2):103174","DOI:10.1016/j.im.2019.103174","Project: Future of Collaboration"],"references":["332118765_A_Program_of_Collaboration_Engineering_Research_and_Practice_Contributions_Insights_and_Future_Directions","323302750_The_Malicious_Use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Forecasting_Prevention_and_Mitigation","322365070_Human-Robot_Similarity_and_Willingness_to_Work_with_a_Robotic_Co-worker","320165216_Robots_AI_and_the_question_of_'e-persons'_-_a_panel_at_the_2017_Science_in_Public_conference_10-12_July_2017","317525547_Emotional_Attachment_Performance_and_Viability_in_Teams_Collaborating_with_Embodied_Physical_Action_EPA_Robots","305208728_Artificial_Cognition_for_Social_Human-Robot_Interaction_An_Implementation","298857415_The_Minnesota_GDSS_Research_Project_Group_Support_Systems_Group_Processes_and_Outcomes","327046458_Children_conform_adults_resist_A_robot_group_induced_peer_pressure_on_normative_social_conformity","326173969_How_human-computer_'superminds'_are_redefining_the_future_of_work","305410508_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK_FOR_THE_DESIGN_OF_ORGANIZATIONAL_CONTROL_MECHANISMS"]}
