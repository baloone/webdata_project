{"id":"258727013_Query_Complexity_of_Derivative-Free_Optimization","abstract":"This paper provides lower bounds on the convergence rate of Derivative\nFree Optimization (DFO) with noisy function evaluations, exposing a\nfundamental and unavoidable gap between the performance of algorithms\nwith access to gradients and those with access to only function\nevaluations. However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable,\nand for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to\nbe near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A\ndistinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued\nfunction comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the\nalgorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as\noptimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for\nexample. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy\nfunction evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the\nconvergence rate is the same.","authors":["Kevin G.
