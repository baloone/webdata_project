{"id":"317233454_Confidence_matching_in_group_decision-making","abstract":"Most important decisions in our society are made by groups,\nfrom cabinets and commissions to boards and juries. When disagreement\narises, opinions expressed with higher confidence\ntend to carry more weight. Although an individual’s degree\nof confidence often reflects the probability that their opinion\nis correct, it can also vary with task-irrelevant psychological,\nsocial, cultural and demographic factors. Therefore, to\ncombine their opinions optimally, group members must adapt\nto each other’s individual biases and express their confidence\naccording to a common metric. However, solving this communication\nproblem is computationally difficult. Here we\nshow that pairs of individuals making group decisions meet\nthis challenge by using a heuristic strategy that we call ‘confidence\nmatching’: they match their communicated confidence\nso that certainty and uncertainty is stated in approximately\nequal measure by each party. Combining the behavioural data\nwith computational modelling, we show that this strategy is\neffective when group members have similar levels of expertise,\nand that it is robust when group members have no insight\ninto their relative levels of expertise. Confidence matching is,\nhowever, sub-optimal and can cause miscommunication about\nwho is more likely to be correct. This herding behaviour is one\nreason why groups can fail to make good decisions.","authors":["Dan Bang","Laurence Aitchison","Rani Moran","Santiago Herce Castanon"],"meta":["May 2017Nature Human Behaviour 1(6)","DOI:10.1038/s41562-017-0117"],"references":["303618292_Communicating_uncertainty_in_seasonal_and_interannual_climate_forecasts_in_Europe","283448350_Doubly_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Confidence_in_Perceptual_Decision-Making","279268619_Communicating_uncertainty_in_seasonal_and_interannual_climate_forecasts_in_Europe","275061120_Active_inference_Communication_and_hermeneutics","273637442_Equality_bias_impairs_collective_decision-making_across_cultures","314336505_The_Strategy_of_Conflict","302071573_Signatures_of_a_Statistical_Computation_in_the_Human_Sense_of_Confidence","298332570_GRADING_IN_GROUPS","283323254_Individual_consistency_in_the_accuracy_and_distribution_of_confidence_judgments","279397521_Verification_of_Forecasts_Expressed_in_Terms_of_Probability_Monthly_Weather_Review_78_1-3"]}
