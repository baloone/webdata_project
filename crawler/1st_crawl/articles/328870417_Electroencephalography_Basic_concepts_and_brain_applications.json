{"id":"328870417_Electroencephalography_Basic_concepts_and_brain_applications","abstract":"Within the cortex, the primary projection neurons are pyramidal cells.10 Pyramidal neurons have an asymmetric shape (reflecting that of a pyramid). It is this asymmetry that forms the basis for the open field geometric configuration necessary to generate the volume conducted electrical potentials recorded at the scalp (Figure 24.2).
