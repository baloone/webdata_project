{"id":"352378633_A_machine_learning_approach_to_predict_healthcare_cost_of_breast_cancer_patients","abstract":"This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to perform an early prediction of the healthcare cost of breast cancer patients. The learning phase of our prediction method considers the following two steps: (1) in the first step, the patients are clustered taking into account the sequences of actions undergoing similar clinical activities and ensuring similar healthcare costs, and (2) a Markov chain is then learned for each group to describe the action-sequences of the patients in the cluster. A two step procedure is undertaken in the prediction phase: (1) first, the healthcare cost of a new patient’s treatment is estimated based on the average healthcare cost of its k -nearest neighbors in each group, and (2) finally, an aggregate measure of the healthcare cost estimated by each group is used as the final predicted cost. Experiments undertaken reveal a mean absolute percentage error as small as 6%, even when half of the clinical records of a patient is available, substantiating the early prediction capability of the proposed method. Comparative analysis substantiates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art techniques.","authors":["Pratyusha Rakshit","Onintze Zaballa","Aritz Pérez","Elisa Gómez-Inhiesto"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91580-x"],"references":["348051480_Identifying_common_treatments_from_Electronic_Health_Records_with_missing_information_An_application_to_breast_cancer","327140179_Why_When_and_How_to_Adjust_Your_P_Values","312370190_scmamp_Statistical_Comparison_of_Multiple_Algorithms_in_Multiple_Problems","309527321_A_study_on_the_use_of_non-parametric_tests_for_analyzing_the_evolutionary_algorithms'_behaviour_a_case_study_on_the_CEC'2005_special_session_on_real_parameter_optimization","325532519_Supervised_Learning_Methods_for_Predicting_Healthcare_Costs_Systematic_Literature_Review_and_Empirical_Evaluation","318844132_DBSCAN_revisited_revisited_Why_and_how_you_should_still_use_DBSCAN","312432923_Regularization_and_Variable_Selection_via_the_Elastic_Nets","300631794_Population_Cost_Prediction_on_Public_Healthcare_Datasets","278700103_Density-Based_Clustering_Based_on_Hierarchical_Density_Estimates","242414156_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_Bagging_and_Boosting","228605587_Algorithmic_Prediction_of_Health_Care_Costs_and_Discovery_of_Medical_Knowledge","220403416_A_study_on_the_use_of_non-parametric_tests_for_analyzing_the_evolutionary_algorithms'_behaviour_A_case_study_on_the_CEC'2005_Special_Session_on_Real_Parameter_Optimization","51062605_Regression_Models_for_Analyzing_Costs_and_Their_Determinants_in_Health_Care_An_Introductory_Review","227604843_Zou_H_Hastie_T_Regularization_and_variable_selection_via_the_elastic_net_J_R_Statist_Soc_B_2005672301-20","224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule"]}
