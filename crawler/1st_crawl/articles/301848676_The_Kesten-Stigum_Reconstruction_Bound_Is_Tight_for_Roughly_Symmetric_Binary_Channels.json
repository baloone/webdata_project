{"id":"301848676_The_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_Is_Tight_for_Roughly_Symmetric_Binary_Channels","abstract":"We establish the exact threshold for the reconstruction problem for a binary asymmetric channel on the b-ary tree, provided that the asymmetry is sufficiently small. This is the first exact reconstruction threshold obtained in roughly a decade. We discuss the implications of our result for Glauber dynamics, phylogenetic reconstruction, and so-called ``replica symmetry breaking'' in spin glasses and random satisfiability problems.","authors":["Christian Borgs","Jennifer Chayes","Elchanan Mossel","Sebastien Roch"],"meta":["April 2006"],"references":["225703548_Glauber_Dynamics_on_Trees_Boundary_Conditions_and_Mixing_Time","11286980_Analytic_and_Algorithmic_Solution_of_Random_Satisfiability_Problems","2392143_Broadcasting_on_Trees_and_the_Ising_Model","2118267_The_critical_Ising_model_on_trees_concave_recursions_and_nonlinear_capacity","2108379_Glauber_Dynamics_on_Trees_and_Hyperbolic_Graphs","2099361_Information_flow_on_trees","1848720_Reconstruction_on_Trees_and_Spin_Glass_Transition","321331258_Optimal_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction","267441795_Gibbs_Measures_and_Phase_Transitions","247329833_Random_k-satisfiability_fro_m_an_analytic_solution_to_an_effici_ent_algo-rithm","237918167_Intersections_of_Cantor_sets_and_transversality_of_semigroups","226508411_On_the_Extremality_of_the_Disordered_State_for_the_Ising_Model_on_the_Bethe_Lattice","226205967_On_the_purity_of_limiting_Gibbs_state_for_the_Ising_model_on_the_Bethe_lattice","38386396_Remarks_on_the_limiting_Gibbs_states_on_a_d_1-tree","38365393_Additional_Limit_Theorems_for_Indecomposable_Multidimensional_Galton-Watson_Processes","38362475_Markov_Random_Fields_on_an_Infinite_Tree","38360917_Random_Walks_and_Percolation_on_Trees","38330551_The_Ising_model_and_percolation_on_trees_and_tree-like_graphs","38329907_A_mean_field_spin_glass_with_short-range_interactions","2475793_Robust_Reconstruction_on_Trees_is_Determined_By_the_Second_Eigenvalue","2387233_Reconstruction_on_Trees_Beating_the_Second_Eigenvalue","2113428_Survey_Information_flow_on_trees"]}
