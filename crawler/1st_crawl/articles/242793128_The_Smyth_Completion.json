{"id":"242793128_The_Smyth_Completion","abstract":"The Smyth completion ([15], [16], [18] and [19]) provides a topological foundation for Denotational Semantics. We show that this theory simultaneously provides a topological foundation for the complexity analysis of programs via the new theory of “complexity (distance) spaces”. The complexity spaces are shown to be weightable ([13], [8], [10]) and thus belong to the class of S-completable quasi-uniform spaces ([19]). We show that the S-completable spaces possess a sequential Smyth completion. The applicability of the theory to “Divide & Conquer” algorithms is illustrated by a new proof (based on the Banach theorem) of the fact that mergesort has optimal asymptotic average running time.","authors":["Michel Schellekens"],"meta":["December 1995Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 1:535-556","DOI:10.1016/S1571-0661(04)00029-5"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","268245997_Spazi_quasimetrici_e_topologie_ad_essi_associate","316805467_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","270151777_Topology_and_Order","268308412_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_2_chapter_4","268018700_Quasi-Uniform_Spaces","265568165_Completeness_of_Quasi-Uniform_and_Syntopological_Spaces","262348269_Totally_bounded_spaces_and_compact_ordered_spaces_as_domains_of_computation","261857656_The_Smyth-completion_of_a_quasi-uniform_space","247341617_QuasiUniform_Completeness_In_Terms_Of_Cauchy_Nets"]}
