The research illustrates how this model is used effectively on secondary data collected from the Department of Computer Science, University of Jos, Nigeria.Multiple Linear Regression was used with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) analysis tool. Statistical Hypothesis testing was then used to validate the model with a 5% level of significance.\nKeywords: Learning Analytics, Educational Data Mining, Students Academic Performance, Multiple Linear Regression.","authors":["Yinka Oyerinde","Chia P."],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Computer Applications 157(4):37-44","DOI:10.5120/ijca2017912671"],"references":["267510046_Learning_Analytics_and_Educational_Data_Mining_in_Practice_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Empirical_Evidence","258124336_Mining_students'_academic_performance","254465952_Do_Skills_Combine_Additively_to_Predict_Task_Di_culty_in_Eighth-grade_Mathematics","254044494_Proposed_academic_students'_performance_prediction_model_A_Malaysian_case_study","352816120_Teaming_for_Student_Success","324281612_Applied_Regression_Analysis","256476561_In_Applied_Regression_Analysis","256309431_The_State_of_Educational_Data_Mining_in_2009_A_Review_and_Future_Visions","254021802_A_Survey_and_Future_Vision_of_Data_Mining_in_Educational_Field","252761512_Predicting_Students'_Marks_from_Moodle_Logs_using_Neural_Network_Models"]}
