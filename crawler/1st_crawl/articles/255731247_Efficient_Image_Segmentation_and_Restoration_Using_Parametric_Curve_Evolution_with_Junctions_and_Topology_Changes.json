Together with an a posteriori denoising in the segmented\nhomogeneous regions this leads to a fast and efficient method for image\nsegmentation and restoration. An uneven spread of mesh points is avoided by\nusing the tangential degrees of freedom. Several numerical simulations on\nartificial test problems and on real images illustrate the performance of the\nmethod.","authors":["Heike Frei","Harald Garcke"],"meta":["August 2013SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 7(2014-07-03)","DOI:10.1137/130932430","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261144367_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing","258291542_New_fast_and_stable_Lagrangean_method_for_image_segmentation","258291381_Lagrangean_method_with_topological_changes_for_numerical_modelling_of_forest_fire_propagation","313617603_Lagrangean_method_with_topological_changes_for_numerical_modelling_of_forest_fire_propagation","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","297472167_Total_variation_denoising_and_enhancement_of_color_images_based_on_the_CB_and_HSV_color_models","284653608_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","277551253_Algorithm_832","263155724_A_Multiphase_Level_Set_Framework_for_Image_Segmentation_Using_the_Mumford_and_Shah_Model","245481718_Computation_of_geometric_partial_differential_equations_and_mean_curvature_flow","237453457_3D_Embryogenesis_Image_Segmentation_by_the_Generalized_Subjective_Surfaces_Method_using_the_Finite_Volume_Technique","245451947_A_fast_multiphase_level_set_algorithm_for_solving_the_Chan-Vese_model","242494925_Evolution_of_curves_on_a_surface_driven_by_the_geodesic_curvature_and_external_force","229532840_A_direct_method_for_solving_an_anisotropic_mean_curvature_flow_of_plane_curves_with_an_external_force","228083869_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models"]}
