{"id":"338935593_Regular_and_Intra-Regular_Neutrosophic_Left_Almost_Semihypergroups","abstract":"In this chapter, the authors characterized regular and intra-regular neutrosophic LA-semihypergroups by giving some examples with different neutrosophic identities and prove a various important result about it with the help of different neutrosophic identities. The aim in this chapter is to characterize the idea of regular and intra-regular neutrosophic LA-semihypergroups, (weakly, strongly, completely) regular neutrosophic LA-semihypergroups using neutrosophuic sets. They also define different substructures of regular neutrosophic LA-semihypergroup namely (weakly, left, right, strongly, completely) regular neutrosophic LA-semihypergroup with some basic results. Further, invertible neutrosophic LA-semihypergroup are also define in the last.","authors":["Muhammad Gulistan"],"meta":["January 2020","In book: Emerging Applications of Fuzzy Algebraic Structures","Project: Some Applications of Neutrosophic cubic sets in multi-criteria decision making"],"references":[]}
