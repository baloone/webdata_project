{"id":"318183751_Hardness_and_Structural_Results_for_Half-Squares_of_Restricted_Tree_Convex_Bipartite_Graphs","abstract":"Let \\(B=(X,Y,E)\\) be a bipartite graph. A half-square of B has one color class of B as vertex set, say X; two vertices are adjacent whenever they have a common neighbor in Y. Every planar graph is half-square of a planar bipartite graph, namely of its subdivision. Until recently, only half-squares of planar bipartite graphs (the map graphs) have been investigated, and the most discussed problem is whether it is possible to recognize these graphs faster and simpler than Thorupâ€™s \\(O(n^{120})\\) time algorithm.","authors":["Hoang-Oanh Le","Van Bang Le"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-62389-4_30","Conference: International Computing and Combinatorics Conference"],"references":["311991050_On_the_complete_width_and_edge_clique_cover_problems","281768731_On_4-Map_Graphs_and_1-Planar_Graphs_and_their_Recognition_Problem","281450731_On_the_Complete_Width_and_Edge_Clique_Cover_Problems","322082563_Linear-time_recognition_of_map_graphs_with_outerplanar_witness","321716595_Linear-Time_Recognition_of_Map_Graphs_with_Outerplanar_Witness","289803377_Restricted_Bipartite_Graphs_Comparison_and_Hardness_Results","278416789_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Independent_Sets_in_Map_Graphs","265461639_Indifference_graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","262252768_Feedback_vertex_sets_on_restricted_bipartite_graphs","245992693_Efficient_Graph_Representations","243768419_Topics_in_Intersection_Graph_Theory","242630892_Contentment_in_graph_theory_Covering_graphs_with_cliques","234780812_Covering_Edges_by_Cliques_with_Regard_to_Keyword_Conflicts_and_Intersection_Graphs","230595955_A_Characterization_of_Comparability_Graphs_and_of_Interval_Graphs","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","222749577_A_characterization_of_totally_balanced_hypergraphs","222596702_Characterizations_of_strongly_chordal_graphs","222456849_Computing_Roots_of_Graphs_is_Hard","221590655_Doubly_Lexical_Orderings_of_Matrices","220898111_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_the_k_r-Center_in_Planar_Graphs_and_Map_Graphs","220616342_The_NP-Completeness_of_Some_Edge-Partition_Problems","220533072_Recognizing_Powers_of_Proper_Interval_Split_and_Chordal_Graph","220459472_The_Bidimensionality_Theory_and_Its_Algorithmic_Applications","220432383_Map_graphs","220390439_Bipartite_Roots_of_Graphs","51951258_Bidimensionality_and_Geometric_Graphs","44329868_Algorithmic_graph_theory_and_perfect_graphs_Martin_Charles_Golumbic","38346920_Incidence_Matrices_and_Interval_Graphs","3785037_Map_graphs_in_polynomial_time"]}
