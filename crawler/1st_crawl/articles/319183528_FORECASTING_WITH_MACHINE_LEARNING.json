{"id":"319183528_FORECASTING_WITH_MACHINE_LEARNING","abstract":"For years, people have been forecasting weather patterns, economic and political events, sports outcomes, and more. In this paper we discussed the ways of using machine learning in forecasting, machine learning is a branch of computer science where algorithms learn from data. The fundamental problem for machine learning and time series is the same: to predict new outcomes based on previously known results. Using the suitable technique of machine learning depend on how much data you have, how noisy the data is, and what kind of new features can be derived from the data. But these techniques can improve accuracy and donâ€™t have to be difficult to implement.","authors":["Osman Abbas"],"meta":["August 2017","Project:  Neural Networks Forecasting"],"references":[]}
