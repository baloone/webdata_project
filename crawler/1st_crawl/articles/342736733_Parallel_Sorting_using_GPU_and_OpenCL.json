{"id":"342736733_Parallel_Sorting_using_GPU_and_OpenCL","abstract":"Every person that studies computer science should dedicate some thoughts into the topic of data parallelism and methods to exploit data parallelism where there is no evident independent data. Sorting is a good example to show the difficulty and the insight behind algorithms that rely heavy on sequential computation but can be decomposed into small problems, it is also a good exercise to the mind to start doing things concurrently when they are not supposed to be done in parallel.","authors":["Giorgio Locicero"],"meta":["March 2020","Project: GPU and parallel computing"],"references":[]}
