{"id":"257885699_CFD_based_analysis_of_flow_distribution_in_a_coaxial_vacuum_tube_solar_collector_with_laminar_flow_conditions","abstract":"A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been conducted to find the pressure losses for dividing and combining fluid flow through a tee junction of a solar collector manifold. Simulations are performed for a range of flow ratios and Reynolds numbers, and equations are developed for pressure loss coefficients at junctions. A theoretical model based on successive approximations then is employed to estimate the isothermal and non-isothermal flow distribution in laminar range through a collector consisting of 60 vacuum tubes connected in parallel in a reverse (U-configuration) and parallel (Z-configuration) flow arrangement. The results are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental results for U-configuration. The proposed CFD based strategy can be used as a substitute to setting up and performing costly experiments for estimating junction losses.","authors":["Abdul Waheed Badar","Reiner Buchholz","Yongsheng Lou","Felix Ziegler"],"meta":["August 2012International Journal of Energy and Environmental Engineering 3(1)","DOI:10.1186/2251-6832-3-24"],"references":["252552191_Flow_Distribution_in_Parallel_Connected_Manifolds_for_Evacuated_Tubular_Solar_Collectors","275377206_Evaporation_in_Solar_Thermal_Collectors_During_Operation-Reasons_and_Effects_of_Partial_Stagnation","256334586_Analysis_and_performance_of_flat-plate_solar_collector_arrays","245387438_Calculation_of_steady_flow_pressure_loss_coefficients_for_pipe_junctions","245366575_Buoyancy_Effects_on_Thermal_Behavior_of_a_Flat-Plate_Solar_Collector","245364123_Handbook_of_Hydraulic_Resistance_2nd_Edition","245170245_Flow_distribution_in_a_solar_collector_panel_with_horizontally_inclined_absorber_strips","245170084_Numerical_3-D_heat_flux_simulations_on_flat_plate_solar_collectors","245169941_Internal_thermal_coupling_in_direct-flow_coaxial_vacuum_tube_collectors","245169538_Flow_distribution_in_manifolded_solar_collectors_with_negligible_buoyancy_effects"]}
