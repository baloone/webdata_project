{"id":"328027690_Two_constructions_of_asymptotically_optimal_codebooks","abstract":"Codebooks with low-coherence have wide applications in many fields such as direct spread code division multiple access communications, compressed sensing, signal processing and so on. In this paper, we propose two constructions of complex codebooks from the operations of certain sets. The complex codebooks produced by these constructions are proved to be asymptotically optimal with respect to the Welch bound. In addition, the parameters of the complex codebooks presented in this paper are new and flexible in some cases.","authors":["Gaojun Luo"],"meta":["July 2019Cryptography and Communications 11(2)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-018-0331-4"],"references":["321286431_Two_Constructions_of_Asymptotically_Optimal_Codebooks_via_the_Hyper_Eisenstein_Sum","313801595_More_constructions_of_near_optimal_codebooks_associated_with_binary_sequences","280445306_Packing_Lines_Planes_etc_Packings_in_Grassmannian_Space","317088091_Asymptotically_optimal_codebooks_based_on_generalized_Jacobi_sums","316079570_New_Constructions_of_Asymptotically_Optimal_Codebooks_With_Multiplicative_Characters","305695566_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","301847046_Equiangular_tight_frames_from_hyperovals","282949456_Steiner_equiangular_tight_frames_redux","267172731_New_nearly_optimal_codebooks_from_relative_difference_sets","262416938_Near-Optimal_Partial_Hadamard_Codebook_Construction_Using_Binary_Sequences_Obtained_From_Quadratic_Residue_Mapping","260872388_Construction_of_Incoherent_Unit_Norm_Tight_Frames_With_Application_to_Compressed_Sensing","260712444_New_Constructions_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_With_Equality","258162338_Two_families_of_nearly_optimal_codebooks","254061567_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Associated_With_Binary_Sequences","254056958_Two_Classes_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound"]}
