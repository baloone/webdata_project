{"id":"223497998_A_Comparison_of_Reactive_Chemotaxis_Algorithms","abstract":"This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of four reactive robot chemotaxis algorithms. If they are applicable, reactive algorithms can provide fast, simple and cost-effective solutions for robot control applications. As part of this evaluation a robot was developed that has sufficient resources to enable it to implement each of the chemotaxis algorithms. The robot has bilateral chemical sensors, an airflow sensor and tactile whiskers to detect obstacles. Chemotaxis algorithms observed in the bacterium E. coli, the silkworm moth Bombyx mori, and the dung beetle Geotrupes stercorarius were tested as well as a gradient-based algorithm. There are many potential applications for chemical sensing robots particularly in situations where animals such as sniffer dogs are currently used. These applications include locating victims of avalanches or earthquakes and detecting landmines. Robotic systems offer a number of benefits compared to the use of animals, including rapid deployment, low maintenance costs and operation for extended periods. Details of the algorithms are given together with typical results obtained using the algorithms in both simulated and practical experiments. The design of the chemical sensing robot and the relative merits and demerits of the different chemotaxis algorithms are also discussed.","authors":["R.Andrew Russell","Alireza Bab-Hadiashar","Rod L.
