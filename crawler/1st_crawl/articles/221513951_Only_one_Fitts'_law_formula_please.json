{"id":"221513951_Only_one_Fitts'_law_formula_please","abstract":"The HCI community uses at least four different formulas for Fitts' law. Each of them is derived from Shannon's information theory. This raises the question which formula is wrong and which is right. While the HCI community on the one hand gives free choice for the formula, it demands good statistical values for the evaluation on the other hand. From a scientific point of view this situation is not satisfying.","authors":["Heiko Drewes"],"meta":["April 2010","DOI:10.1145/1753846.1753867","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2010, Extended Abstracts Volume, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, April 10-15, 2010"],"references":["222565230_Characterizing_computer_input_with_Fitts'_law_parameters_The_information_and_non-information_aspects_of_pointing","221518299_Usability_evaluation_considered_harmful_some_of_the_time","221516755_A_comparison_of_input_devices_in_element_pointing_and_dragging_tasks","221474758_Efficient_eye_pointing_with_a_fisheye_lens","314824198_Application_of_Fitts'_law_to_eye_gaze_interaction","261625387_A_Note_on_the_Information-Theoretic_Basis_for_Fitts'_Law","234807312_Application_of_Fitt's_Law_to_Eye_Gaze_Interaction","49305400_Fundamentals_of_Skill","21752413_The_Information_Capacity_of_the_Human_Motor_System_in_Controlling_the_Amplitude_of_Movement","8570149_A_note_on_the_information-theoretic_basis_of_Fitts'_law"]}
