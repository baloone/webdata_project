The features of visible light and reflected laser light signal were extracted by decomposing\nthe originally captured signals into different frequency bands by wavelet packet decomposition method (WPD). The captured signal of the spectrometer mainly covers the optical wavelength from 400 nm to 900 nm, which was divided into 25 sub-bands to extract the spectrum features of the spectrometer signal by statistical methods. The features of the plume are acquired by the UVV band visual sensor system, and the features of keyhole are extracted captured from the images captured by AI visual sensor system through the digital image processing method. Based on these quantified real-time features of the welding process, a deep learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to detect three different\nwelding defects during high-power disk laser welding. The established deep learning model is compared with the backpropagation neural network (BP) model, and it shows higher accuracy and robustness in detecting welding defects with the multi-sensor system. Its effectiveness was also validated by four welding experiments with\ndifferent welding parameters.","authors":["Yanxi Zhang","Deyong You","Xiangdong Gao","Nanfeng Zhang"],"meta":["April 2019Journal of Manufacturing Systems 51:87-94","DOI:10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.02.004"],"references":["318360321_A_Deep_Learning_Architecture_for_Temporal_Sleep_Stage_Classification_Using_Multivariate_and_Multimodal_Time_Series","309540140_Deep_Learning_for_Decentralized_Parking_Lot_Occupancy_Detection","301854112_Learning_scale-variant_and_scale-invariant_features_for_deep_image_classification","282526218_An_overview_of_the_state_of_art_in_laser_welding_simulation","254063340_Mechanisms_of_Spiking_and_Humping_in_Keyhole_Welding","224130713_A_Vision-Based_Self-Tuning_Fuzzy_Controller_for_Fillet_Weld_Seam_Tracking","325500630_Correlation_analysis_of_penetration_based_on_keyhole_and_plasma_plume_in_laser_welding","311896579_A_Fast_and_Memory_Saved_GPU_Acceleration_Algorithm_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Target_Detection","311211034_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Noise_Robust_Speech_Recognition","309004297_Comparing_Two_Classes_of_End-to-End_Machine-Learning_Models_in_Lung_Nodule_Detection_and_Classification_MTANNs_vs_CNNs","303559106_Improving_the_performance_of_pedestrian_detectors_using_convolutional_learning","299369954_High_power_laser_welding_of_thick_steel_plates_in_a_horizontal_butt_joint_configuration","295290727_Dynamics_of_vapor_plume_in_transient_keyhole_during_laser_welding_of_stainless_steel_Local_evaporation_plume_swing_and_gas_entrapment_into_porosity","290624063_A_study_on_ray_tracing_method_for_CFD_simulations_of_laser_keyhole_welding_progressive_search_method","277338502_3D_transient_multiphase_model_for_keyhole_vapor_plume_and_weld_pool_dynamics_in_laser_welding_including_the_ambient_pressure_effect","272250707_High_speed_imaging_technique_Part_2_-_High_speed_imaging_of_power_beam_welding_phenomena","265178583_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition","260626238_An_Arc_Welding_Robot_Control_for_a_Shaped_Metal_Deposition_Plant_Modular_Software_Interface_and_Sensors","260542156_Real-Time_Implementation_of_Fault-Tolerant_Control_Systems_With_Performance_Optimization","257407569_A_comparison_study_of_basic_data-driven_fault_diagnosis_and_process_monitoring_methods_on_the_benchmark_Tennessee_Eastman_process","256818432_Real-time_monitoring_of_laser_welding_of_galvanized_high_strength_steel_in_lap_joint_configuration","251609892_Relationship_of_laser_absorption_to_keyhole_behavior_in_high_power_fiber_laser_welding_of_stainless_steel_and_aluminum_alloy","241638908_Seam_Tracking_Monitoring_Based_on_Adaptive_Kalman_Filter_Embedded_Elman_Neural_Network_During_High-Power_Fiber_Laser_Welding","230956311_Theoretical_analysis_of_keyhole_dynamics_in_polarized_laser_drilling","230924362_Elucidation_of_Hgh-Power_Hbre_Laser_Welding_Phenomena_of_Stainless_Steel_and_Effect_of_Factors_on_Weld_Geometry","224206044_Deep_Learning_and_Its_Applications_to_Signal_and_Information_Processing_Exploratory_DSP"]}
