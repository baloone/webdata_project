{"id":"334969862_How_Hard_Will_this_Task_Be_Developments_in_Analyzing_and_Predicting_Question_Difficulty_in_the_Bebras_Challenge","abstract":"Predicting the difficulty level of a task on the concepts of computer science or computational thinking, like in the Bebras Challenge, proves to be really hard. Question difficulty breaks down in content difficulty, stimulus difficulty and task difficulty. Several instruments are suggested to predict the overall difficulty level, like using a questionnaire or a rubric; these instruments are applied on the data of a recent contest and proved useful. Relative scoring could also turnout helpful. Especially on content difficulty easy applicable solutions are lacking.","authors":["Willem van der Vegt"],"meta":["May 2018OLYMPIADS IN INFORMATICS 12:119-132","DOI:10.15388/ioi.2018.10","Project: Dificulty Level Bebras Tasks"],"references":["356355884_Predicting_the_Difficulty_Level_of_a_Bebras_Task","317013386_Exploring_Bebras_Tasks_Content_and_Performance_A_Multinational_Study","303239675_Bebras_-_a_Sustainable_Community_Building_Model_for_the_Concept_Based_Learning_of_Informatics_and_Computational_Thinking","321148186_Promoting_Computational_Thinking_Skills_Would_You_Use_this_Bebras_Task","320848850_How_presentation_affects_the_difficulty_of_computational_thinking_tasks_an_IRT_analysis","298801775_Predictive_Analysis_Assigning_Weightage_and_Difficulty_Level_of_Question_using_Data_Mining","286837031_Calibrating_the_Difficulty_of_an_Assessment_Tool_The_Blooming_of_a_Statistics_Examination","286630251_Problem_complexity_A_measure_of_problem_difficulty_in_algebra_by_using_computer","254581819_A_framework_for_predicting_item_difficulty_in_reading_tests","237540181_Bebras_International_Contest_on_Informatics_and_Computer_Literacy_The_Educational_Benefit_of_Solving_Short_Informatics_Tasks"]}
