{"id":"286513564_On_Variational_Expressions_for_Quantum_Relative_Entropies","abstract":"Distance measures between quantum states like the trace distance and the\nfidelity can naturally be defined by optimizing a classical distance measure\nover all measurement statistics that can be obtained from the respective\nquantum states. In contrast, Petz showed that the measured relative entropy,\ndefined as a maximization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence over projective\nmeasurement statistics, is strictly smaller than Umegaki's quantum relative\nentropy whenever the states do not commute. We extend this result in two ways.\nFirst, we show that Petz' conclusion remains true if we allow general positive\nvalued measures. To do this, we prove that maximizing the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence over general positive valued measures results in the measured\nrelative entropy. Second, we extend the result to R\\'enyi relative entropies\nand show that for non-commuting states the sandwiched R\\'enyi relative entropy\nis strictly larger than the measured R\\'enyi relative entropy for $\\alpha \\in\n(\\frac12, \\infty)$, and strictly smaller for $\\alpha \\in [0,\\frac12)$. The\nlatter statement provides counterexamples for the data-processing inequality of\nthe sandwiched R\\'enyi relative entropy for $\\alpha < \\frac12$. Our main tool\nis a new variational expression for the measured R\\'enyi relative entropy,\nwhich we further exploit to show that certain lower bounds on quantum\nconditional mutual information are superadditive.","authors":["Mario Berta","Omar Fawzi","Marco Tomamichel"],"meta":["December 2017Letters in Mathematical Physics 107(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11005-017-0990-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287249508_Operational_meaning_of_quantum_measures_of_recovery","283169540_Recoverability_in_quantum_information_theory","282181305_Universal_recovery_from_a_decrease_of_quantum_relative_entropy","317010531_Relative_entropy_optimization_in_quantum_information_theory_via_semidefinite_programming_approximations","316541206_Conditional_expectation_in_an_operator_algebra_ii","306117052_Strengthened_monotonicity_of_relative_entropy_via_pinched_Petz_recovery_map","300160904_The_Proper_Formula_for_Relative_Entropy_and_its_Asymptotics_in_Quantum_Probability","299577052_Relative_entropy_optimization_and_its_applications","280698300_Inequality_with_applications_in_statistical_mechanics","279633029_Strengthened_Monotonicity_of_Relative_Entropy_via_Pinched_Petz_Recovery_Map"]}
