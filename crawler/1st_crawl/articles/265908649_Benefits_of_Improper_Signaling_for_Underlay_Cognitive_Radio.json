{"id":"265908649_Benefits_of_Improper_Signaling_for_Underlay_Cognitive_Radio","abstract":"In this letter we study the potential benefits of improper signaling for a\nsecondary user (SU) in underlay cognitive radio networks. We consider a basic\nyet illustrative scenario in which the primary user (PU) always transmit proper\nGaussian signals and has a minimum rate constraint. After parameterizing the SU\ntransmit signal in terms of its power and circularity coefficient (which\nmeasures the degree of impropriety), we prove that the SU improves its rate by\ntransmitting improper signals only when the ratio of the squared modulus\nbetween the SU-PU interference link and the SU direct link exceeds a given\nthreshold. As a by-product of this analysis, we obtain the optimal circularity\ncoefficient that must be used by the SU depending on its power budget. Some\nsimulation results show that the SU benefits from the transmission of improper\nsignals especially when the PU is not highly loaded.","authors":["Christian Lameiro","Ignacio Santamar√≠a","Peter J.
