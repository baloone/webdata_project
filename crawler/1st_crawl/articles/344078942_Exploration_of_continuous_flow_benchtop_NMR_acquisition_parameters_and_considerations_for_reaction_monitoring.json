{"id":"344078942_Exploration_of_continuous_flow_benchtop_NMR_acquisition_parameters_and_considerations_for_reaction_monitoring","abstract":"This study focused on fundamental data acquisition parameter selection for a benchtop NMR system with continuous flow, applicable for reaction monitoring. The effect of flow rate on the mixing behaviours within a flow cell was observed, along with an exponential decay relationship between flow rate and the apparent spin-lattice relaxation time (T1*) of benzaldehyde. We also monitored sensitivity (as determined by signal-to-noise ratios, SNRs) under various flow rates, analyte concentrations, and temperatures of the analyte flask. Results suggest a maximum SNR can be achieved with low to medium flow rates and higher analyte concentrations. This was consistent with data collected with parameters that promote either slow or fast data acquisition. We further consider the effect of these conditions on the analyte's residence time, T1*, and magnetic field inhomogeneity that is a product of continuous flow. Altogether, our results demonstrate how fundamental acquisition parameters can be manipulated to achieve optimal data acquisition in continuous flow NMR systems.","authors":["Tristan Maschmeyer","Paloma L Prieto","Shad Grunert","Jason E Hein"],"meta":["September 2020Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry 58(12)","DOI:10.1002/mrc.5094"],"references":["45189789_In-situ_characterization_of_the_cure_reaction_of_HTPB_and_IPDI_by_simultaneous_NMR_and_IR_measurements","8915025_Quantitative_high_resolution_On-Line_NMR-spectroscopy_in_reaction_and_process_monitoring","6300920_Optimising_Reaction_Performance_in_the_Pharmaceutical_Industry_by_Monitoring_with_NMR","327774640_Seeking_Universal_Detectors_for_Analytical_Characterizations","309088811_A_Benchtop_NMR_Spectrometer_as_a_Tool_for_Monitoring_Mesoscale_Continuous-Flow_Organic_Synthesis_Equipment_Interface_and_Assessment_in_Four_Organic_Transformations","305750767_Gradient-based_solvent_suppression_methods_on_a_benchtop_spectrometer","284797100_Preparation_of_Grignard_reagents_from_magnesium_metal_under_continuous_flow_conditions_and_on-line_monitoring_by_NMR_spectroscopy","280869437_Reaction_monitoring_using_online_vs_tube_NMR_spectroscopy_Seriously_different_results","275255942_IR_and_NMR_Reaction_Monitoring_Techniques_for_Nucleophilic_Addition_Reactions_In_Situ_Monitoring_of_the_Addition_of_Benzimidazole_to_a_Pyridinium_Salt","271226487_Monitoring_chemical_reactions_by_low-field_benchtop_NMR_at_45MHz_Pros_and_cons","268236989_A_Self_Optimizing_Synthetic_Organic_Reactor_System_Using_Real-time_In-line_NMR_spectroscopy","267872273_An_NMR_flow-tube_for_online_NMR_reaction_monitoring","264562337_On-Line_Monitoring_of_Chemical_Reactions_by_using_Bench-Top_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy","263957871_A_Safe_and_Efficient_Synthetic_Route_to_a_25-Dimethyl-1-aryl-1H-imidazole_Intermediate","263943896_Kinetic_Understanding_Using_NMR_Reaction_Profiling","245401332_Comparison_of_Calibration_Methods_for_the_Monitoring_of_a_Fluorobenzene_Batch_Reaction_Using_Low-Field_19F_NMR_1H_NMR_NIR_and_Raman_Spectrometries","236908897_H-1-NMR_Quantification_of_Major_Saccharides_in_Acai_Raw_Materials_a_Comparison_of_the_Internal_Standard_Methodology_with_the_Absolute_Intensity_qNMR_Method","231700625_Online_Low-Field_1H_NMR_Spectroscopy_Monitoring_of_Emulsion_Polymerization_of_Butyl_Acrylate","44661349_A_Simple_Flowcell_for_Reaction_Monitoring_by_NMR","41548925_NMR_of_natural_products_at_the_'nanomole-scale'","24233373_A_Microfluidic_High-Resolution_NMR_Flow_Probe","19356035_Mapping_space_by_NMR_using_susceptibility_changes_at_phase_boundaries","7848810_Validation_of_quantitative_NMR"]}
