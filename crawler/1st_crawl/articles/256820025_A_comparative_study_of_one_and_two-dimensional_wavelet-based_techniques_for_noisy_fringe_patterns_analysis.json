{"id":"256820025_A_comparative_study_of_one_and_two-dimensional_wavelet-based_techniques_for_noisy_fringe_patterns_analysis","abstract":"Today, more severe industrial constraints of realization require frequently a measurement and control techniques. The optical metrology methods allow a non-destructive control of a wide range of parameters (deformations, displacements…), with a very high accuracy. The phase retrieval is a successful measurement technique which allows the reconstruction of 3D images of physical parameters from the intensity fringe patterns. This research work articulates around the phase retrieval from a single fringe pattern using the wavelet-based techniques. We present here a comparative study of the phase retrieval algorithms based on the one and two-dimensional continuous wavelet transforms for getting access to the phase distribution via local analysis of a noisy fringe patterns. An evaluation through numerical simulations was conducted to prove the validity and the performance of the algorithms. The main advantage of these techniques is their ability to offer a metrological solution adapted to the dynamic analysis needs in disruptive environments.","authors":["Mustapha Bahich","Mohammed Bailich","Ahmed Imloul","Mohamed Afifi"],"meta":["March 2013Optics Communications 290:43–48","DOI:10.1016/j.optcom.2012.10.054","Project: Phase Retrieval & Optical Imaging"],"references":["251490613_A_numerical_spatial_carrier_for_single_fringe_pattern_analysis_algorithm","242801159_Local_Frequency_Analysis_with_Two-Dimensional_Wavelet_Transform","221869591_Wavelet-based_algorithm_for_optical_phase_distribution_evaluation","221865293_Speckle_Correlation_Fringes_Denoising_using_Stationary_Wavelet_Transform_Application_in_Wavelet_phase_evaluation_technique","221725173_Fourier-transform_method_of_fringe-pattern_analysis_for_computer-based_topography_and_inteferometry","221673152_Five-frame_phase-shifting_algorithm_insensitive_to_diode_laser_power_variation","37457354_Moving_ahead_with_phase","37450600_Photomechanics","6128330_Spatial_fringe_pattern_analysis_using_the_two-dimensional_continuous_wavelet_transform_employing_a_cost_function"]}
