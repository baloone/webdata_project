{"id":"296627920_Counting_by_weighing_know_your_numbers_with_confidence","abstract":"Counting by weighing is often more efficient than counting manually which is time consuming and prone to human errors, especially when the number of items (e.g. plant seeds, printed labels, coins) is large. The published papers in the statistical literature have focused on how to count, by weighing, a random number of items that is close to a pre-specified number in some sense. This paper considers the new problem, arising \nfrom a consultation with a company, of making inference about the number of one-penny coins in a bag with known weight for infinitely many bags,by using the estimated distribution of coin weight from one calibration data set only. Specifically, a lower confidence bound has been constructed on the number of one-penny coins for each of infinitely many future bags of one-penny coins, as required by the company. As the same calibration data set is used repeatedly in the construction of all these lower confidence bounds, the interpretation of coverage frequency of the lower confidence bounds proposed in this paper is different from that of a usual confidence set.","authors":["Wei Liu","Yang Han","Frank Bretz","Fang Wan"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C Applied Statistics 65(4):n/a-n/a","DOI:10.1111/rssc.12142"],"references":["288292994_Improving_quality_control_procedures_for_seed-borne_pathogens_by_testing_sub-samples_of_seeds","283374650_Probability_Theory","265546950_Probability_Theory_Independence_Interchangeability_Martingales","258216679_Accurate_Estimation_of_Count_Totals_Using_Ratio_Estimators","254332486_Counting_a_Large_Number_of_Items_Using_the_Weight_of_a_Small_Sample","247672665_Counting_by_weighing_and_its_effect_on_seed_testing_procedures","241721865_Counting_by_Weighing_An_Approach_Using_Renewal_Theory","240268387_Addendum_to_counting_by_weighing_and_the_seed_testing_problem","232900762_Another_look_at_counting_by_weighing","230873259_Outline_of_a_theory_of_statistical_estimation_based_on_the_classical_theory_of_probability","230317029_On_a_problem_of_counting_by_weighing","44542798_Probability_theory_independence_interchangeability_martingales_Yuan_Shih_Chow_Henry_Teicher","40149954_Rapid_and_non-destructive_assessment_of_the_number_of_eggs_in_cysts_of_potato_cyst_nematodes_by_weighing","23636098_Counting_by_weighing_and_its_effect_on_comparing_population_proportions"]}
