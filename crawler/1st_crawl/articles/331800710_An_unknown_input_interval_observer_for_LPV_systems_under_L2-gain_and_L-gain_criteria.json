{"id":"331800710_An_unknown_input_interval_observer_for_LPV_systems_under_L2-gain_and_L-gain_criteria","abstract":"This paper investigates the design of an unknown input interval observer, for linear parameter varying systems. The proposed method provides a solution to the decoupling conditions under L2-gain and L∞-gain performance level. It is shown that the design of the unknown input interval observer parameters can be formulated as a SDP problem. The major advantages with regard to other solutions is that first, it does not require the explicit knowledge of a (time-varying) state transformation, for the estimation error dynamics to satisfy the Meztler property. Rather, it is shown how such a property can be formulated as a part of the SDP optimization process; Second, decoupling and L2/L∞ constraints are formulated on the thickness of the interval length in spite of half the interval length. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a numerical academic example.","authors":["Nicolas Ellero","David Gucik","David Henry"],"meta":["May 2019Automatica 103","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2019.02.012"],"references":["284788000_Interval_peak-to-peak_observers_for_continuous-_and_discrete-time_systems_with_persistent_inputs_and_delays","268522442_A_New_Approach_to_Design_Interval_Observers_for_Linear_Systems","282629319_Interval_observer_design_for_LPV_systems_with_parametric_uncertainty","277561761_Interval_Observers_for_Continuous-Time_LPV_Systems_with_L1_L2_Performance","266024551_An_effective_method_to_interval_observer_design_for_time-varying","254200882_Parameter-dependant_state_observer_design_for_affine_LPV_systems","245094765_A_Survey_on_M-Matrices","242855762_Structured_Semidenite_Programs_and_Semialgebraic_Geometry_Methods_in_Robustness_and_Optimization","241758881_Guaranteed_nonlinear_state_estimation_for_continuous-_time_dynamical_models_from_discrete-time_measurements","236650212_Interval_Estimation_for_LPV_Systems_Applying_High_Order_Sliding_Mode_Techniques"]}
