{"id":"309828230_Speed_in_Clinical_Magnetic_Resonance","abstract":"The relevant clinical accelerated magnetic resonance techniques that are available currently for routine patient examinations are reviewed, presenting and discussing the benefits therein when compared with more conventional scans. The focus is on clinical use and practicality, with the review divided into 3 sections. Improvements in 3-dimensional acquisition are first discussed, specifically controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration, related radial techniques, and CAIPI-Dixon-TWIST-VIBE. Simultaneous multislice imaging is then reviewed, focusing on current implementation for 2-dimensional imaging, including both echo-planar and fast spin echo techniques. The final topic is that of sparse reconstruction (data sparsity), discussing the principles therein, challenges, and current applications. Guidance in terms of clinical use for accelerated techniques is provided, focusing on enabling faster and improved clinical scan results.","authors":["Val M Runge","Johannes K Richter","Johannes T
