{"id":"305663929_Influence_of_object_translucency_on_the_scanning_accuracy_of_a_powder-free_intraoral_scanner_A_laboratory_study","abstract":"Statement of problem: \nLimited information is available regarding the influence of object translucency on the scanning accuracy of a powder-free intraoral scanner.\n\nPurpose: \nThe purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the scanning accuracy of a confocal microscopy principle powder-free intraoral scanner on ceramic copings and to analyze the relationship between scanning accuracy and object translucency.\n\nMethods: \nSix slice specimens (12×10 mm) and 6 offset copings (1.00-mm thickness) were made from different translucent homogeneous ceramic blocks (CEREC Blocs, S0-M to S5-M, highest to lowest translucency). The primary sintered zirconia offset coping was produced in the same way as the control. Optical parameters related to the translucency of each slice were measured with a spectrophotometer. Three-dimensional (3D) datasets of the surface morphology of offset copings were obtained by using the intraoral scanner. The same white wax resin bases were used for registration. Quantitative parameters of scanning trueness and precision were measured. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the values of each parameter among the 6 ceramic blocks. Bivariate correlation was used to analyze the relationships between each parameter of scanning accuracy and translucency (α=.05).\n\nResults: \nTranslucent copings showed a positive 3D bias (S0-M to S5-M: 0.149 ±0.038 mm to 0.068 ±0.020 mm), a narrower collar diameter (Dd=-0.067 mm), larger convergence angle (ΔΦ=2.79 degrees), and larger curvature radius of the internal gingivoaxial corner (Δρ=0.236 mm). The smaller the percentage sum of scattering and absorption, the greater was the occurrence of scanning bias (r=-0.918) and curvature (r=-0.935) decrease.\n\nConclusions: \nUse of the tested powder-free intraoral scanner, higher translucency objects (greater translucency than S1-M/A1C) resulted in lower scanning accuracy and morphological changes. Therefore, more suitable methods of measurement are still required.","authors":["Hong Li","Peijun Lyu","Yong Wang","Yuchun Sun"],"meta":["July 2016The Journal of prosthetic dentistry 117(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.04.008"],"references":["258635989_Accuracy_of_full-arch_scans_using_intraoral_scanners","233839384_Three-dimensional_surface_reconstruction_within_noncontact_diffuse_optical_tomography_using_structured_light","224254859_An_Analysis_of_Using_High-Frequency_Sinusoidal_Illumination_to_Measure_the_3D_Shape_of_Translucent_Objects","51205088_Full_arch_scans_Conventional_versus_digital_impressions_-_An_in-vitro_study_Ganzkieferaufnahmen_Konventionelle_versus_digitale_Abformtechnik_-_Eine_In-vitro-Untersuchung","23399375_Dental_impressions_using_3D_digital_scanners_virtual_becomes_reality","280118683_Three-dimensional_evaluation_of_the_repeatability_of_scanned_conventional_impressions_of_prepared_teeth_generated_with_white-_and_blue-light_scanners","275988404_Optical_Penetration_Depth_Simulation_of_Dental_Tissue_Based_on_Finite_Element_Method","273147191_Influence_of_material_surface_on_the_scanning_error_of_a_powder-free_3D_measuring_system","264827711_Scanning_accuracy_and_precision_in_4_intraoral_scanners_An_in_vitro_comparison_based_on_3-dimensional_analysis","260114780_Fit_of_4-unit_FDPs_made_of_zirconia_and_CoCr-alloy_after_chairside_and_labside_digitalization_-_A_laboratory_study","258427750_Applicability_and_accuracy_of_an_intraoral_scanner_for_scanning_multiple_implants_in_edentulous_mandibles_A_pilot_study","256329459_Precision_of_intraoral_digital_dental_impressions_with_iTero_and_extraoral_digitization_with_the_iTero_and_a_model_scanner","255175110_Validity_reliability_and_reproducibility_of_the_iOC_intraoral_scanner_A_comparison_of_tooth_widths_and_Bolton_ratios","254255799_Assessing_the_feasibility_and_accuracy_of_digitizing_edentulous_jaws","246018264_Fundamentals_of_color_Shade_matching_and_communication_in_esthetic_dentistry","236138141_Using_digitally_coded_healing_abutments_and_an_intraoral_scanner_to_fabricate_implant-supported_cement-retained_restorations","235440786_Accuracy_of_complete-Arch_dental_impressions_A_new_method_of_measuring_trueness_and_precision","234010039_Validity_reliability_and_reproducibility_of_linear_measurements_on_digital_models_obtained_from_intraoral_and_cone-beam_computed_tomography_scans_of_alginate_impressions","215457405_Fast_Separation_of_Direct_and_Global_Components_of_a_Scene_using_High_Frequency_Illumination","47699744_Optical_properties_of_base_dentin_ceramics_for_all-ceramic_restorations","46035505_Two_imaging_techniques_for_3D_quantification_of_pre-cementation_space_for_CADCAM_crowns","21350985_Marginal_Adaptation_of_Castable_Ceramic_Crowns","12560701_Color_and_translucency_of_in_vivo_natural_central_incisors","6218871_Accuracy_of_two_impression_techniques_with_angulated_implants","5264769_Translucency_of_newly_extracted_maxillary_central_incisors_at_nine_locations","4193816_Structured_light_in_scattering_media"]}
