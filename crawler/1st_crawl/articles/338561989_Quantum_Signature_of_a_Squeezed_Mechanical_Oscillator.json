{"id":"338561989_Quantum_Signature_of_a_Squeezed_Mechanical_Oscillator","abstract":"Recent optomechanical experiments have observed nonclassical properties in macroscopic mechanical oscillators. A key indicator of such properties is the asymmetry in the strength of the motional sidebands produced in the probe electromagnetic field, which is originated by the noncommutativity between the oscillator ladder operators. Here we extend the analysis to a squeezed state of an oscillator embedded in an optical cavity, produced by the parametric effect originated by a suitable combination of optical fields. The motional sidebands assume a peculiar shape, related to the modified system dynamics, with asymmetric features revealing and quantifying the quantum component of the squeezed oscillator motion.","authors":["Avishek Chowdhury","Paolo Vezio","M.
