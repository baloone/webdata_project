Here we attempt to predict the pace of acidification in the Digha coast of the Bay of Bengal based on available datasets of more than three decades. The ground zero observation on the data set reveals a decreasing trend of pH since 1984 with a sudden hike in premonsoon 2020, the period coinciding with the COVID 19 lockdown phase in the Indian sub-continent.","authors":["Sitangshu Roy","Nabonita Pal","Mourani Sinha","Sufia Zaman"],"meta":["December 2021","DOI:10.26782/jmcms.2021.12.00002","Project: Water quality in and around estuarine Indian Sundarbans"],"references":["331832481_SURFACE_WATER_pH_A_PROXY_TO_ACIDIFICATION_OF_ESTUARINE_WATER_OF_INDIAN_SUNDARBANS","331132169_A_marine_bivalve_Crassostrea_cuculata_can_be_used_as_an_indicator_species_of_marine_pollution","289112326_Pulse_of_climate_change_in_Indian_Sundarbans_A_myth_or_reality","264737098_Basics_of_Marine_and_Estuarine_Ecology","262489570_Changes_in_the_global_value_of_ecosystem_services","262009924_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate","229086194_The_Value_of_the_World's_Ecosystem_Services_and_Natural_Capital","225347991_Valuing_Ecosystem_Services","223007756_Fluxes_of_nutrients_from_the_tropical_River_Hooghly_at_the_land-ocean_boundary_of_Sundarbans_NE_Coast_of_Bay_of_Bengal_India","299355006_Anthropogenic_carbon_release_rate_unprecedented_during_the_past_66_million_years"]}
