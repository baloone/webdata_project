{"id":"337232487_Do_the_Right_Thing_for_Whom_An_Experiment_on_Ingroup_Favouritism_Group_Assortativity_and_Moral_Suasion","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the effect of moral suasion on ingroup favouritism. We report a well-powered, pre-registered, two-stage 2x2 mixed-design experiment. In the first stage, groups are formed on the basis of how participants answer to a set of questions, concerning non-morally relevant issues in one treatment (assortativity on non-moral preferences), and morally relevant issues in another treatment (assortativity on moral preferences). In the second stage, participants choose how to split a given amount of money between participants of their own group and participants of the other group, first in the baseline setting and then in a setting where they are told to do what they believe to be morally right (moral suasion). Our main results are: (i) in the baseline, participants tend to favour their own group to a greater extent when groups are assorted according to moral preferences, compared to when they are assorted according to non-moral preferences; (ii) the net effect of moral suasion is to decrease ingroup favouritism, but there is also a non-negligible proportion of participants for whom moral suasion increases ingroup favouritism; (iii) the effect of moral suasion is substantially stable across group assortativity and four pre-registered individual characteristics (gender, political orientation, religiosity, pro-life vs pro-choice ethical convictions).","authors":["Ennio Bilancinio","Leonardo Boncinelli","Valerio Capraro","Tatiana Celadin"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.31234/osf.io/s6wmu"],"references":["335180062_Increasing_altruistic_and_cooperative_behaviour_with_simple_moral_nudges","323276962_Do_the_right_thing_Experimental_evidence_that_preferences_for_moral_behavior_rather_than_equity_or_efficiency_per_se_drive_human_prosociality","321982613_Prolificac-A_subject_pool_for_online_experiments","314195614_Push_don't_nudge_Behavioral_spillovers_and_policy_instruments","276424505_In_Intergroup_Conflict_Self-sacrifice_is_Stronger_among_Pro-social_Individuals_and_Parochial_Altruism_Emerges_specially_among_Cognitively_Taxed_Individuals","273466933_Preferences_and_beliefs_in_ingroup_favoritism","269398045_Dictator_Game_Giving_The_Importance_of_Descriptive_versus_Injunctive_Norms","267695461_Social_Identity_and_Intergroup_Conflict","265968226_The_evolutionary_interplay_of_intergroup_conflict_and_altruism_in_humans_A_review_of_parochial_altruism_theory_and_prospects_for_its_extension","260811761_A_Theory_of_Group_Selection","258920778_Moral_Character_Predominates_in_Person_Perception_and_Evaluation","258179748_Dual-Process_Theories_of_Higher_Cognition","257754248_The_Price_of_Racial_Bias_Intergroup_Negotiations_in_the_Ultimatum_Game","254452673_Homo_Moralis-Preference_Evolution_Under_Incomplete_Information_and_Assortative_Matching","240281933_On_the_Dominance_of_Moral_Categories_in_Impression_Formation","234049865_Ideology_and_Prejudice_The_Role_of_Value_Conflicts","232450958_Social_Dominance_Orientation_and_the_Political_Psychology_of_Gender_A_Case_of_Invariance","228303533_Using_Non-Pecuniary_Strategies_to_Influence_Behavior_Evidence_from_a_Large_Scale_Field_Experiment","227858481_Evolution_of_in-group_favoritism","227363048_Group_Identity_and_Social_Preferences","221963758_Testing_for_Altruism_and_Social_Pressure_in_Charitable_Giving","51415480_Personality_and_Prejudice_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Theoretical_Review","356300987_Moral_Universalism_Measurement_and_Heterogeneity","334222421_The_Dual-Process_Approach_to_Human_Sociality_A_Review","320073844_You've_Got_Mail_A_Randomised_Field_Experiment_on_Tax_Evasion","318047039_Deliberation_erodes_cooperative_behavior_-_Even_towards_competitive_out-groups_even_when_using_a_control_condition_and_even_when_eliminating_selection_bias","317998624_oTree_-_An_Open-Source_Platform_for_Laboratory_Online_and_Field_Experiments","314884371_Identifying_Social_Norms_using_Coordination_Games_Why_Does_Dictator_Game_Sharing_Vary","313008893_Experiments_in_intergroup_discrimination","309373639_The_behavioralist_as_tax_collector_Using_natural_field_experiments_to_enhance_tax_compliance","308144626_Costly_punishment_in_the_ultimatum_game_evokes_moral_concern_in_particular_when_framed_as_payoff_reduction","287972714_Using_descriptive_social_norms_to_increase_charitable_giving_The_power_of_local_norms","279236582_The_Denial_of_Death","273109110_Racism_and_Support_of_Free-Market_Capitalism_A_Cross-Cultural_Analysis","265605204_Social_Context_and_the_Dynamics_of_Cooperative_Choice","260044783_The_essential_moral_self","256063848_Norms_Make_Preferences_Social","255992617_The_Association_of_Religiosity_and_Political_Conservatism_The_Role_of_Political_Engagement","247233614_A_cue_of_kinship_promotes_cooperation_for_the_public_good","246850728_The_Effects_of_Mortality_Salience_on_Intergroup_Bias_between_Minimal_Groups","234837307_Social_Psychology_of_Intergroup_Relations","229216849_A_Focus_Theory_of_Normative_Conduct_A_Theoretical_Refinement_and_Reevaluation_of_the_Role_of_Norms_in_Human_Behavior","228431977_Norms_and_Contracting","227534238_Gendered_giving_The_influence_of_social_norms_on_the_donation_behavior_of_men_and_women","223024391_Group_Identity_Social_Distance_and_Intergroup_Bias","222637534_Promoting_helping_behavior_with_framing_in_dictator_games","222429516_Aversion_to_Norm-Breaking_A_Model","221989069_Social_Interactions_and_the_Salience_of_Social_Identity","51992768_The_Dictator_Game_Fairness_and_Ethnicity_in_Postwar_Bosnia","51078547_Highlighting_Relatedness_Promotes_Prosocial_Motives_and_Behavior","46546853_Social_Image_and_the_50-50_Norm_A_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Analysis_of_Audience_Effects","23547467_A_Room_With_a_Viewpoint_Using_Social_Norms_to_Motivate_Environmental_Conservation_in_Hotels","46493636_The_Focusing_and_Informational_Effects_of_Norms_on_Pro-Social_Behavior","46467124_Do_the_Right_Thing_The_Effects_of_Moral_Suasion_on_Cooperation","24114047_Do_the_Right_Thing_But_Only_if_Others_do_so"]}
