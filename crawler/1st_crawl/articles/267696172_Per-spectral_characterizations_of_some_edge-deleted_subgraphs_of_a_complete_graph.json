CÃ¡mara and Haemers proved that graphs in are uniquely determined by their adjacency spectra with the exception for graphs and . In this paper, we show that all graphs in are uniquely determined by their permanental spectra. We further extend our findings by investigating when a complete graph with a few edges removed is uniquely determined by its permanental spectrum. More precisely, we prove that if induces a star, or a matching, or a disjoint union of a matching and a path , then is uniquely determined by its permanental spectrum.","authors":["Heping Zhang","Tingzeng Wu","Hong-Jian Lai"],"meta":["February 2015Linear and Multilinear Algebra 63(2)","DOI:10.1080/03081087.2013.869592","Project: The permanental spectra of graphs"],"references":["268019010_A_Note_on_the_Permanental_Roots_of_Bipartite_Graphs","285737362_Chemical_graph_theory_III_On_the_permanental_polynomial","268552948_Relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_fullerenes_and_benzenoid_hydrocarbons","268023750_Graphical_enumeration_problems","267189752_Computing_the_permanental_polynomial_of_C_60_in_parallel","266979210_The_permanental_polynomials_of_certain_graphs","266012860_A_note_on_the_relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_coronoid_hydrocarbons","265718014_Cospectral_Graphs_and_Digraphs","263688077_Characterizing_properties_of_permanental_polynomials_of_lollipop_graphs","256805376_On_the_characterizing_properties_of_the_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs"]}
