{"id":"333426653_Damage_detection_in_a_novel_deep-learning_framework_a_robust_method_for_feature_extraction","abstract":"Extracting damage features precisely while overcoming the adverse interferences of measurement noise and incomplete data is a problem demanding prompt solution in structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, we present a deep-learning-based method that can extract the damage features from mode shapes without utilizing any hand-engineered feature or prior knowledge. To meet various requirements of the damage scenarios, we use convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and design a new network architecture: a multi-scale module, which helps in extracting features at various scales that can reduce the interference of contaminated data; stacked residual learning modules, which help in accelerating the network convergence; and a global average pooling layer, which helps in reducing the consumption of computing resources and obtaining a regression performance. An extensive evaluation of the proposed method is conducted by using datasets based on numerical simulations, along with two datasets based on laboratory measurements. The transferring parameter methodology is introduced to reduce retraining requirement without any decreases in precision. Furthermore, we plot the feature vectors of each layer to discuss the damage features learned at these layers and additionally provide the basis for explaining the working principle of the neural network. The results show that our proposed method has accuracy improvements of at least 10% over other network architectures.","authors":["Tian Guo","Lianping Wu","Cunjun Wang","Zili Xu"],"meta":["May 2019Structural Health Monitoring 19(1):147592171984605","DOI:10.1177/1475921719846051"],"references":["326927800_Vibration-based_structural_health_monitoring_under_changing_environmental_conditions_using_Kalman_filtering","320997168_Structural_Damage_Detection_with_Automatic_Feature-Extraction_through_Deep_Learning","328149034_A_novel_deep_learning-based_method_for_damage_identification_of_smart_building_structures","327778517_Development_and_application_of_a_deep_learning-based_sparse_autoencoder_framework_for_structural_damage_identification","324130102_Deep_normalized_convolutional_neural_network_for_imbalanced_fault_classification_of_machinery_and_its_understanding_via_visualization","323250536_Damage_detection_of_building_structures_under_ambient_excitation_through_the_analysis_of_the_relationship_between_the_modal_participation_ratio_and_story_stiffness","322531008_Structural_health_monitoring_using_DOG_multi-scale_space_An_approach_for_analyzing_damage_characteristics","322191500_A_new_surface_fractal_dimension_for_displacement_mode_shape-based_damage_identification_of_plate-type_structures","322172861_Rolling_bearing_fault_feature_learning_using_improved_convolutional_deep_belief_network_with_compressed_sensing","320022017_Optimal_filter_design_with_progressive_genetic_algorithm_for_local_damage_detection_in_rolling_bearings"]}
