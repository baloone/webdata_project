{"id":"300481246_A_TUI-based_Programming_Tool_for_Children","abstract":"TanPro-Kit 2.0 is a programming tool for children aged 6 to 8, which is based on tangible user interface (TUI). It consists of programming blocks and a LED pad. The pad presents visual and audible feedback according to the arrangement of programming blocks with which children construct programs to play a maze game. Based on TanPro-Kit, we expanded three important programming concepts: parameters, Boolean logic and branch, and improved the system to support two-dimensional connection, which aims to make the program structure clearer. To realize these new features, we added three kinds of programming blocks accordingly, improved the process of block sequence in Arduino, and modified the infrared and wireless communications of the Single-Chip Microcomputer (SCM). A lab-based user study with 15 children was conducted, and the results show that the children can use the system to complete tasks easily and have a basic understanding of the related programming concepts.","authors":["Danli Wang","Lan Zhang","Yunfeng Qi","Fang Sun"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2729094.2742630","Conference: the 2015 ACM Conference"],"references":["274377900_Computational_Thinking","274309848_Computational_Thinking","269704129_Evaluating_children_performance_with_graphical_and_tangible_robot_programming_tools","255632182_The_Future_of_Educational_Computing_ResearchThe_Case_of_Computer_Programming","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","241623587_Tangicons_30_An_educational_non-competitive_collaborative_game","221518424_Tangible_user_interfaces_for_children","221513788_Comparing_the_use_of_tangible_and_graphical_programming_languages_for_informal_science_education","50985300_CASE_STUDY_Advancing_Elementary-School_Girls'_Programming_through_Game_Design","2311166_Tangible_Bits_Towards_Seamless_Interfaces_between_People_Bits_and_Atoms","313572690_Comparing_the_use_of_tangible_and_graphical_programming_languages_for_informal_science_education","261860722_TanPro-Kit_A_tangible_programming_tool_for_children","251353846_Tangibles_for_learning_A_representational_analysis_of_physical_manipulation","221308580_The_robot_is_the_program_interacting_with_roBlocks","220141368_From_turtles_to_Tangible_Programming_Bricks_Explorations_in_physical_language_design","41201985_How_Young_Children_Learn_to_Program_With_Sensor_Action_and_Logic_Blocks"]}
