{"id":"274896750_Implementation_of_a_time_table_generator_using_visual_BasicNet","abstract":"A lecture and examination Timetable Generator (TTGen) for the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Agriculture, Makurdi-Nigeria was designed and implemented using Microsoft's Visual Basic.Net and MySQL database server as a backend. The application has the ability to manage Students, Lecturers, Venues, Periods, and Courses of the Department. It also features an image handling module for the lecturer, student and venue objects. The data from the application is saved in a MySQL database using a configurable database module and a randomizer module to generate the best combination of courses and periods for an efficient time table. Using the TTGen, lecture and examination timetables with no infringements for the first semester of the 2009/2010 academic session were generated after only eight iteration steps. The timetable generator is capable of arranging timetable schedules for many departments and faculties of universities and similar institutions where course units are offered.","authors":["Joseph M Mom","Jonathan Enokela"],"meta":["May 2012"],"references":[]}
