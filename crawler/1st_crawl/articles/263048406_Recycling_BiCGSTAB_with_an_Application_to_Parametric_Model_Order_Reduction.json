{"id":"263048406_Recycling_BiCGSTAB_with_an_Application_to_Parametric_Model_Order_Reduction","abstract":"Krylov subspace recycling is a process for accelerating the convergence of\nsequences of linear systems. Based on this technique we have recently developed\nthe recycling BiCG algorithm. We now generalize and extend this recycling\ntheory to BiCGSTAB. Recycling BiCG focuses on efficiently solving sequences of\ndual linear systems, while the focus here is on efficiently solving sequences\nof single linear systems (assuming non-symmetric matrices for both recycling\nBiCG and recycling BiCGSTAB).\nAs compared to other methods for solving sequences of single linear systems\nwith non-symmetric matrices (e.g., recycling variants of GMRES), BiCG based\nrecycling algorithms, like recycling BiCGSTAB, have the advantage that they\ninvolve a short-term recurrence, and hence, do not suffer from storage issues\nand are also cheaper with respect to the orthogonalizations.\nWe modify the BiCGSTAB algorithm to use a recycle space, which is built from\nleft and right approximate eigenvectors. Using our algorithm for a parametric\nmodel order reduction example gives good results. We show about 40% savings in\niterations, and demonstrate that solving the problem without recycling leads to\n(about) a 35% increase in runtime.","authors":["Kapil Ahuja","Peter Benner","Eric de Sturler","Lihong Feng"],"meta":["June 2014SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 37(5)","DOI:10.1137/140972433","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283537898_A_Survey_of_Projection-Based_Model_Reduction_Methods_for_Parametric_Dynamical_Systems","266996138_A_Robust_Algorithm_for_Parametric_Model_Order_Reduction_Based_on_Implicit_Moment_Matching","323023946_Deflated_BiCGStab_for_linear_equations_in_QCD_problems","312628324_Solution_of_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_by_Minimized_Iterations","279400529_Deflated_and_Augmented_Krylov_Subspace_Methods_A_Framework_for_Deflated_BiCG_and_Related_Solvers","258790993_Subspace_recycling_accelerates_the_parametric_macro-modeling_of_MEMS","250765635_Iterative_Methods_for_Sparse_Linear_System","246336765_GPBi-CG_Generalized_Product-type_Methods_Based_on_Bi-CG_for_Solving_Nonsymmetric_Linear_Systems","243659840_Variants_of_BICGSTAB_for_matrices_with_complex_spectrum","243476145_CGS_A_Fast_Lanczos-Type_Solver_for_Nonsymmetric_Linear_systems","242985968_Avoiding_breakdown_in_variants_of_the_BI-CGSTAB_algorithm","239556237_Solution_of_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_by_Minimized_Iterations1","235638731_Extending_the_eigCG_algorithm_to_nonsymmetric_Lanczos_for_linear_systemswith_multiple_right-hand_sides","232004220_Lanczos-type_solvers_for_unsymmetric_linear_systems_of_equations","231150704_Efficient_extraction_of_thin-film_thermal_parameters_from_numerical_models_via_parametric_model_order_reduction"]}
