{"id":"221653893_Efficient_clustering_of_high-dimensional_data_sets_with_application_to_reference_matching","abstract":"Many important problems involve clustering large datasets. Although naive implementations of clustering are computationally expensive, there are established efficient techniques for clustering when the dataset has either (1) a limited number of clusters, (2) a low feature dimensionality, or (3) a small number of data points. However, there has been much less work on methods of efficiently clustering datasets that are large in all three ways at once---for example, having millions of data points that exist in many thousands of dimensions representing many thousands of clusters. We present a new technique for clustering these large, high-dimensional datasets. The key idea involves using a cheap, approximate distance measure to efficiently divide the data into overlapping subsets we call canopies. Then clustering is performed by measuring exact distances only between points that occur in a common canopy. Using canopies, large clustering problems that were formerly impossible become practical.
