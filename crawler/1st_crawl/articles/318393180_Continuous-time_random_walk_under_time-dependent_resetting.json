{"id":"318393180_Continuous-time_random_walk_under_time-dependent_resetting","abstract":"Continuous-time random walks of a particle that is randomly reset to an initial position are considered. The distribution of the waiting time between the reset events is represented as a sum of an arbitrary number of exponentials. The governing equation of this stochastic process is established. The mean first-passage time to a particular position is calculated. It is shown that anomalous subdiffusion has a significant impact on the shape of the stationary state.","authors":["V. P.
