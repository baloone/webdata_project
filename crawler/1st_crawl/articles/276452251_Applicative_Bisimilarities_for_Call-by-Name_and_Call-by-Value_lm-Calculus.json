{"id":"276452251_Applicative_Bisimilarities_for_Call-by-Name_and_Call-by-Value_lm-Calculus","abstract":"We propose the first sound and complete bisimilarities for the call-by-name and call-by-value untyped λμ-calculus, defined in the applicative style. We give equivalence examples to illustrate how our relations can be used; in particular, we prove David and Py's counter-example, which cannot be proved with Lassen's preexisting normal form bisimilarities for the λμ-calculus.","authors":["Dariusz Biernacki","Sergueï Lenglet"],"meta":["October 2014Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 308:49-64","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2014.10.004"],"references":["223214520_Bisimilarity_as_a_Theory_of_Functional_Programming","278629966_Sound_and_Complete_Bisimilarities_for_Call-by-Name_and_Call-by-Value_Lambda-mu_Calculus","268626837_lm-calculus_and_Bohm's_theorem","255595946_Head_Normal_Form_Bisimulation_for_Pairs_and_the_lm-Calculus_Extended_Abstract","248592212_Bisimilarity_as_a_Theory_of_Functional_Programming","243536627_X-calculus_models_of_programming_languages","235089022_Lambda-calculus_models_of_programming_languages","225139448_lm-Calculus_An_algorithmic_interpretation_of_classical_natural_deduction","224646976_Head_Normal_Form_Bisimulation_for_Pairs_and_the_lambdamu-Calculus","222450542_Hieb_R_The_revised_report_on_the_syntactic_theories_of_sequential_control_and_state_Theorectical_Computer_Science_1032_235-271"]}
