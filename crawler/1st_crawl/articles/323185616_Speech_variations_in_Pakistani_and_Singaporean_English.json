{"id":"323185616_Speech_variations_in_Pakistani_and_Singaporean_English","abstract":"This paper presents acoustic analysis Q/six English vowels /a: /, /D.â€¢ /, /i: /, /o,/, /D/, /u: / in three minimal pair of English words produced by second language learners in Pakistan. The paper aims to analyze acoustic realizations of Pakistani English vowels and compare them with Singaporean English vowels to investigate as to how much acoustic difference is in terms of Fl and F2 measurements between Pakistani English and Singaporean English. This study used the parameters of vowel quality (Fl and F2) Fundamental frequency I and 2 of English vowels. In addition, the analysis compares English vowels between the groups and within the groups. The data were collected through recordings of voice samples from nine subjects (5 male and 4 female) students. The study hypothesized that there are two varieties and will be different from each other, in terms Q/the production of Pakistani English vowels and Singaporean. The paper also looked at the male and female speakers ' acoustic variations within the group recruited in Pakistan. The speakers were the undergraduate students from the Department of Computer Science, Sindh Madressatul Islam University, Karachi. Speech differences between female and male voices are associated with multidisciplinary variations. Not only do these refer to acoustic (fundamental frequency) and perceptual judgments but also to the size of the vocal track in individual capacity coupled with an educational background of the speakers. The study focused on the height and quality of the vowels to determine the acoustic differences between male and female students and Pakistani vs. Singaporean English.","authors":["Ajab Ali Lashari"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: language"],"references":[]}
