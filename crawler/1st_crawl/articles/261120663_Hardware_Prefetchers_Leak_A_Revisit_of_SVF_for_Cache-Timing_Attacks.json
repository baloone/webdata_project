{"id":"261120663_Hardware_Prefetchers_Leak_A_Revisit_of_SVF_for_Cache-Timing_Attacks","abstract":"Micro-architectural features have an influence on security against cache attacks. This paper shows that modern hardware prefetchers enabled in cache memories to reduce the miss penalty, can be a source of information leakage with respect to cache-timing attacks. The work revisits the Side Channel Vulnerability Factor (SVF) proposed in ISCAÂ¿12 and shows how to adapt the metric to assess the vulnerability of a prefetcher in cache-timing attacks. We use the modified metric denoted Timing-SVF, to show that standard prefetchers based on sequential algorithms can leak information in cache timing attacks. The findings have been established by experimental validations on a standard 128 bit cipher, called CLEFIA, designed by Sony Corporation Ltd. and used for light weight cryptography.","authors":["Sarani Bhattacharya","Chester Rebeiro","Debdeep Mukhopadhyay"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.1109/MICROW.2012.13","Conference: Microarchitecture Workshops (MICROW), 2012 45th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on"],"references":["267194408_Understanding_cache_attacks","225670330_Cache_Based_Remote_Timing_Attack_on_the_AES","220593595_Opportunities_and_Limits_of_Remote_Timing_Attacks","220170079_Non-Monopolizable_Caches_Low-Complexity_Mitigation_of_Cache_Side_Channel_Attacks","200039347_Computer_Architecture_-_A_Quantitative_Approach","270699525_Side-channel_vulnerability_factor","266586337_A_Cache_Timing_Attack_on_AES_in_Virtualization_Environments","262295099_TRESOR_runs_encryption_securely_outside_RAM","254045065_Side-channel_vulnerability_factor_A_metric_for_measuring_information_leakage","244422860_Cryptanalysis_of_Block_Ciphers_Implemented_on_Computers_with_Cache","228939782_Cache-timing_attacks_on_AES","225106141_The_128-bit_blockcipher_CLEFIA_extended_abstract","223151528_Remote_Timing_Attacks_are_Practical","221609031_A_refined_look_at_Bernstein's_AES_side-channel_analysis","221540945_Cache_Timing_Attacks_on_Clefia","221291954_Cryptanalysis_of_DES_Implemented_on_Computers_with_Cache","221282461_Bitslice_Implementation_of_AES","220688841_Computer_Architecture_A_Quantitative_Approach_2nd_Edition","220335456_Theoretical_Use_of_Cache_Memory_as_a_Cryptanalytic_Side-Channel","220269486_Hey_You_Get_Off_of_My_Cloud_Exploring_Information_Leakage_in_Third-Party_Compute_Clouds","51992276_The_microarchitecture_of_Intel_and_AMD_CPU's_An_optimization_guide_for_assembly_programmers_and_compiler_makers"]}
