{"id":"257428713_Hard_Tiling_Problems_with_Simple_Tiles","abstract":"It is well known that the question of whether a given finite region can be tiled with a given set of tiles is \\NP -complete. We show that the same is true for the right tromino and square tetromino on the square lattice, or for the right tromino alone. In the process we show that Monotone 1-in-3 Satisfiability is \\NP -complete for planar cubic graphs. In higher dimensions we show \\NP -completeness for the domino and straight tromino for general regions on the cubic lattice, and for simply connected regions on the four-dimensional hypercubic lattice.","authors":["C.
