{"id":"311582026_New_optimization_model_for_routing_and_spectrum_assignment_with_nodes_insecurity","abstract":"By adopting the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technology, elastic optical networks can provide the flexible and variable bandwidth allocation to each connection request and get higher spectrum utilization. The routing and spectrum assignment problem in elastic optical network is a well-known NP-hard problem. In addition, information security has received worldwide attention. We combine these two problems to investigate the routing and spectrum assignment problem with the guaranteed security in elastic optical network, and establish a new optimization model to minimize the maximum index of the used frequency slots, which is used to determine an optimal routing and spectrum assignment schemes. To solve the model effectively, a hybrid genetic algorithm framework integrating a heuristic algorithm into a genetic algorithm is proposed. The heuristic algorithm is first used to sort the connection requests and then the genetic algorithm is designed to look for an optimal routing and spectrum assignment scheme. In the genetic algorithm, tailor-made crossover, mutation and local search operators are designed. Moreover, simulation experiments are conducted with three heuristic strategies, and the experimental results indicate that the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm framework.","authors":["Hejun Xuan","Yuping Wang","Zhanqi Xu","Shanshan Hao"],"meta":["April 2017Optics Communications 389:42-50","DOI:10.1016/j.optcom.2016.12.007"],"references":["278398621_Hybrid_routing_and_spectrum_assignment_algorithms_based_on_distance-adaptation_combined_coevolution_and_heuristics_in_elastic_optical_networks","234033010_Modeling_the_Routing_and_Spectrum_Allocation_Problem_for_Flexgrid_Optical_Networks","224210952_Routing_and_Spectrum_Allocation_in_OFDM-Based_Optical_Networks_with_Elastic_Bandwidth_Allocation","220429032_Adaptive_wavelength_routing_in_all-optical_networks","220015793_Elastic_Bandwidth_Allocation_in_Flexible_OFDM-Based_Optical_Networks","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","303783124_Reach-dependent_capacity_in_optical_networks_enabled_by_OFDM","283824036_Routing_and_spectrum_allocation_in_multi-ring_based_data_center_networks","283188235_On_Hybrid_IR_and_AR_Service_Provisioning_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks","282477076_Energy-Efficient_Manycast_Routing_and_Spectrum_Assignment_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_for_Cloud_Computing_Environment","279270999_Statistical_analysis_of_blocking_probability_and_fragmentation_based_on_Markov_modeling_of_elastic_spectrum_allocation_on_fiber_link","261320619_A_study_on_routing_modulation_level_and_spectrum_allocation_algorithms_for_elastic_optical_path_networks","260635434_Dynamic_Traffic_Grooming_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks","260533856_A_Two-Population_Based_Evolutionary_Approach_for_Optimizing_Routing_Modulation_and_Spectrum_Assignments_RMSA_in_O-OFDM_Networks","258797392_Dynamic_Service_Provisioning_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_With_Hybrid_Single-Multi-Path_Routing","224163142_Distance-Adaptive_Spectrum_Resource_Allocation_in_Spectrum-Sliced_Elastic_Optical_Path_Network","221244578_Performance_of_Alternative_Routing_Methods_in_All-Optical_Switching_Networks","3158066_Lightpath_Communications_An_Approach_to_High_Bandwidth_Optical_WAN'S"]}
