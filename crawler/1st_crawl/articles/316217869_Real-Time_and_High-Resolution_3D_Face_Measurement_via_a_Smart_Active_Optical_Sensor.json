{"id":"316217869_Real-Time_and_High-Resolution_3D_Face_Measurement_via_a_Smart_Active_Optical_Sensor","abstract":"The 3D measuring range and accuracy in traditional active optical sensing, such as Fourier transform profilometry, are influenced by the zero frequency of the captured patterns. The phase-shifting technique is commonly applied to remove the zero component. However, this phase-shifting method must capture several fringe patterns with phase difference, thereby influencing the real-time performance. This study introduces a smart active optical sensor, in which a composite pattern is utilized. The composite pattern efficiently combines several phase-shifting fringes and carrier frequencies. The method can remove zero frequency by using only one pattern. Model face reconstruction and human face measurement were employed to study the validity and feasibility of this method. Results show no distinct decrease in the precision of the novel method unlike the traditional phase-shifting method. The texture mapping technique was utilized to reconstruct a nature-appearance 3D digital face.","authors":["Yong You","Yang Shen","Guocai Zhang","Xiuwen Xing"],"meta":["April 2017Sensors 17(4)","DOI:10.3390/s17040734"],"references":["271332484_Three-dimensional_facial_recognition_using_passive_long-wavelength_infrared_polarimetric_imaging","235637225_Profilometry_by_fringe_projection","225508956_Real-Time_Correlation-Based_Stereo_Vision_with_Reduced_Border_Errors","223574284_Automatic_facial_feature_extraction_and_3D_face_modeling_using_two_orthogonal_views_with_application_to_3D_face_recognition","290185056_Improved_fast_Fourier_transform_profilometry_based_on_composite_grating","285965206_Optimal_3D_surface_reconstruction_from_a_small_number_of_conventional_2D_X-ray_images","252170173_Theory_and_arrangements_of_self-calibrating_whole-body_3-D-measurement_systems_using_fringe_projection_technique","250711717_Stereo_matching_with_energy-minimizing_snake_grid_for_3D_face_modeling","224622252_3D_face_recognition_using_passive_stereo_vision","222403723_Real-time_acquisition_of_depth_and_color_images_using_structured_light_and_its_application_to_3D_face_recognition"]}
