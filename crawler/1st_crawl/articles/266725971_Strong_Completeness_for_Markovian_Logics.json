{"id":"266725971_Strong_Completeness_for_Markovian_Logics","abstract":"In this paper we present Hilbert-style axiomatizations for three logics for reasoning about continuous-space Markov processes (MPs): (i) a logic for MPs defined for probability distributions on measurable state spaces, (ii) a logic for MPs defined for sub-probability distributions and (iii) a logic defined for arbitrary distributions. These logics are not compact so one needs infinitary rules in order to obtain strong completeness results.\nWe propose a new infinitary rule that replaces the so-called Countable Additivity Rule (CAR) currently used in the literature to address the problem of proving strong completeness for these and similar logics. Unlike the CAR, our rule has a countable set of instances; consequently it allows us to apply the Rasiowa-Sikorski lemma for establishing strong completeness. Our proof method is novel and it can be used for other logics as well.","authors":["Dexter Kozen","Radu Mardare","Prakash Panangaden"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40313-2_58","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["233752834_Continuous_Markovian_Logics_-_Axiomatization_and_Quantified_Metatheory","221558286_Continuous_Markovian_Logic_-_From_Complete_Axiomatization_to_the_Metric_Space_of_Formulas","220897894_Modular_Algorithms_for_Heterogeneous_Modal_Logics","4952403_Probability_Logic_for_Type_Spaces","3707380_Bisimulation_for_labelled_Markov_processes","2590963_Reasoning_About_Knowledge_and_Probability","275628208_Real_Analysis_and_Probability","271512781_Probability_and_Measure","268768615_A_proof_of_the_completeness_theorem_of_Godel","268167575_Stochastic_Relations_Foundations_for_Markov_Transition_Systems","265620609_Real_analysis_and_probability","265368942_Real_Analysis_and_Probability","261165442_Stone_Duality_for_Markov_Processes","257145049_Approximating_Markov_processes_through_filtration","234782239_Complete_deductive_systems_for_probability_logic_with_application_to_harsanyi_type_spaces","223107388_Bisimulation_for_Labelled_Markov_Processes","222484455_Bisimulation_through_Probabilistic_Testing","220694920_Labelled_Markov_Processes","220441108_Probability_Logic_of_Finitely_Additive_Beliefs","220388234_Deduction_Systems_for_Coalgebras_Over_Measurable_Spaces","38382161_On_the_Role_of_the_Baire_Category_Theorem_and_Dependent_Choice_in_the_Foundations_of_Logic","24058674_Interactive_Epistemology_II_Probability","24058673_Interactive_Epistemology_I_Knowledge"]}
