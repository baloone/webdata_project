{"id":"223391097_Optical_Metrology_of_Surfaces","abstract":"Measurement of surface topography plays an important role in manufacturing, being used for both the control of manufacturing processes and for final product acceptance. These measurements can be performed with a variety of instruments which have different capabilities and limitations. In this paper we present a wide variety of instruments that are used for measuring surface topography using optical techniques. These range from systems that are over a century old to recently-developed instrumentation that has broad new capability. We have, insofar as possible, tried to cover all of the instruments used in the visible region; however, considering the plethora of techniques and papers discovered, some omission is certainly possible.","authors":["R.J.
