{"id":"254306219_Boundary-Crossing_Competence_Theoretical_Considerations_and_Educational_Design","abstract":"This article provides a conceptual account and empirical analyses of the development of boundary-crossing competence—the ability to function competently in multiple contexts—using representative cases from two after-school programs with immigrant and low-socioeconomic status students. Our findings suggest that organizational designs that create networks of related communities of practice can provide opportunities for nondominant students to develop boundary-crossing competences through participation in expanded, horizontal—rather than hierarchal—systems of what Moll and colleagues have called “networked expertise.” These new directions in understanding competence have important implications for improving learning designs for nondominant students.","authors":["Dana Walker","Honorine Nocon"],"meta":["July 2007Mind Culture and Activity 14(3):178-195","DOI:10.1080/10749030701316318"],"references":["314800016_Competences_in_education_a_confusion_of_tongues","345909827_La_Clase_Magica_Imagining_Optimal_Possibilities_in_a_Bilingual_Community_of_Learners","344904316_Observing_sociocultural_activity_on_three_planes_participatory_appropriation_guided_participation_and_apprenticeship","344496926_Socio-cultural-historical_psychology_some_general_remarks_and_a_proposal_for_a_new_kind_of_culturalgenetic_methodology","344472399_The_acquisition_of_a_child_by_a_learning_disability","319393603_Communities_of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","313644609_From_transfer_to_boundary-crossing_between_school_and_work_as_a_tool_for_developing_vocational_education_An_introduction","313553434_The_ecology_of_human_development","313223666_Social_and_motivational_bases_for_mathematical_understanding"]}
