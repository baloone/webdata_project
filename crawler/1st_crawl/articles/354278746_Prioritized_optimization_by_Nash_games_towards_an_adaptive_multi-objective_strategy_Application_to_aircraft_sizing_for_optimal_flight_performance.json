The first phase is classical: it corresponds to the optimization of a set of primary cost functions, subject to nonlinear equality constraints, and it yields at least one known Pareto-optimal solution x A * . This study focuses on the second phase, which is introduced to permit to reduce another set of cost functions, considered as secondary, by the determination of a continuum of Nash equilibria, {x̅ ε } (ε≥ 0), in a way such that: firstly, x̅ 0 =x A * (compatibility), and secondly, for ε sufficiently small, the Pareto-optimality condition of the primary cost functions remains O ( ε ²⁾ , whereas the secondary cost functions are linearly decreasing functions of ε . The theoretical results are recalled and the method is applied numerically to a Super-Sonic Business Jet (SSBJ) sizing problem to optimize the flight performance.","authors":["Jean-Antoine Désidéri","Régis Duvigneau"],"meta":["August 2021ESAIM Proceedings and Surveys 71:54-63","DOI:10.1051/proc/202171106"],"references":["216300933_The_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy_A_New_Baseline_Algorithm_for_Pareto_Multiobjective_Optimisation"]}
