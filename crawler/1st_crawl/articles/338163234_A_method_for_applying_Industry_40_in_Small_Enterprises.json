{"id":"338163234_A_method_for_applying_Industry_40_in_Small_Enterprises","abstract":"In the last years, the main European countries that have launched “Industry 4.0” programs to support the development and the innovation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The common goal of these programs is to innovate SMEs in terms of automation (of machines), integration (of lines) and interconnection (of the production system with its management). However, SME managers face great difficulties in accessing funding from an “Industry 4.0” plan, due to lack of information and limits on their knowledge of new information technologies. This paper aims at guiding a manager/technician towards the opportunities offered by “Industry 4.0” in three steps: first, presenting the plan as a decision-making problem, second by illustrating the methodology and finally by describing an application of one SME already financed.","authors":["Teresa Taurino","Agostino Villa"],"meta":["January 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(13):439-444","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.099"],"references":["326497117_Digital_twin-based_WEEE_recycling_recovery_and_remanufacturing_in_the_background_of_Industry_40","290478459_An_approach_to_support_SMEs_in_manufacturing_knowledge_organization","281950124_Enterprise_Integration_and_Interoperability_in_Manufacturing_Systems_Trends_and_Issues","277975059_Graph-based_models_to_classify_effective_collaboration_in_SME_networks","267271828_Making_existing_production_systems_Industry_40-ready","266447351_Conditions_for_Effective_Collaboration_in_SME_Networks_Based_on_Graph_Model","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","316908899_A_spatiotemporal_information_management_framework_for_product_design_and_assembly_process_planning_reconciliation","222323505_Enterprise_modeling_and_integration_EMI_Current_status_and_research_perspectives","222006910_Architectures_for_Enterprise_Integration_and_Interoperability_Past_Present_and_Future","220366136_Enterprise_Systems_State-of-the-Art_and_Future_Trends"]}
