{"id":"301759456_Combining_fuzzy_logic_and_eigenvector_centrality_measure_in_social_network_analysis","abstract":"The rapid growth of social networks use has made a great platform to present different services, increasing beneficiary of services and business profit. Therefore considering different levels of member activities in these networks, finding highly active members who can have the influence on the choice and the role of other members of the community is one the most important and challenging issues in recent years. These nodes that usually have a high number of relations with a lot of quality interactions are called influential nodes. There are various types of methods and measures presented to find these nodes. Among all the measures, centrality is the one that identifies various types of influential nodes in a network. Here we define four different factors which affect the strength of a relationship. A fuzzy inference system calculates the strength of each relation, creates a crisp matrix in which the corresponding elements identify the strength of each relation, and using this matrix eigenvector measure calculates the most influential node. Applying our suggested method resulted in choosing a more realistic central node with consideration of the strength of all friendships.","authors":["Fereshte-Azadi Parand","Hossein Rahimi","Mohsen Gorzin"],"meta":["April 2016Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 459","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2016.03.079"],"references":["289650743_Content_marketing_through_data_mining_on_Facebook_social_network","275364543_Improving_detection_of_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks","267641900_A_fuzzy_closeness_centrality_using_andness-direction_to_control_degree_of_closeness","262406956_KONECT_the_Koblenz_network_collection","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","225070296_Trust_Management_for_the_Semantic_Web","224259331_Practical_Recommendations_on_Crawling_Online_Social_Networks","224137028_Walking_in_Facebook_A_Case_Study_of_Unbiased_Sampling_of_OSNs","222552312_The_Stability_of_Centrality_Measures_When_Networks_Are_Sampled","222538101_Centrality_and_Network_Flow","221298004_Measuring_User_Influence_in_Twitter_The_Million_Follower_Fallacy","209716209_The_Slashdot_Zoo_Mining_a_Social_Network_with_Negative_Edges","283598027_Learning_to_discover_social_circles_in_ego_networks","281720371_An_approximation_of_betweenness_centrality_for_Social_Networks","261262634_Identifying_High_betweenness_Centrality_Vertices_in_Large_Noisy_Networks","249804338_Product_Review_The_Development_of_Social_Network_Analysis_A_Study_in_the_Sociology_of_Science","247440504_A_naturalist's_evo-devo","232461220_Communication_Patterns_in_Task-Oriented_Groups","232423704_Personal_Influence-The_Part_Played_By_People_in_the_Flow_of_Mass_Communication","232397479_Eigenvector-centrality_-_a_node-centrality","225069657_Defining_and_Evaluating_Network_Communities_Based_on_Ground-Truth","216636713_Eigenvector-Like_Measures_of_Centrality_for_Asymmetric_Relations","45264982_Fuzzy_Eigenvectors_of_Real_Matrix","6769446_Characterizing_the_Dynamical_Importance_of_Network_Nodes_and_Links","2887625_A_Faster_Algorithm_for_Betweenness_Centrality"]}
