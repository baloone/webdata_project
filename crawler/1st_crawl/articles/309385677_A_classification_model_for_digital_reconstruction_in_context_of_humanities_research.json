{"id":"309385677_A_classification_model_for_digital_reconstruction_in_context_of_humanities_research","abstract":"Methods of digital 3D reconstruction have been widely applied for\nmore than 20 years to support the research and presentation of historical ob-\njects. While technological backgrounds, project opportunities as well as meth-\nodological considerations for application are widely discussed in literature, a\ncomprehensive classification model is still lacking. Against this background,\nthis article aims at a discussion of common classification approaches for scien-\ntific work and the identification and discussion of specific issues and challenges\nin the context of humanities research. Moreover, a prototypic classification\nscheme for digital reconstruction in the context of humanities research will be\ndeduced, applied, and tested for two practical project settings.","authors":["Sander Münster","Wolfgang Hegel","Cindy Kröber"],"meta":["October 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-47647-6_1","In book: 3D Research Challenges in Cultural Heritage IIEdition: LNCSPublisher: SpringerEditors: S.
