{"id":"260712151_Efficient_integer_DCT_architectures_for_HEVC","abstract":"In this paper, we present area- and power-efficient architectures for the implementation of integer discrete cosine transform (DCT) of different lengths to be used in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). We show that an efficient constant matrix-multiplication scheme can be used to derive parallel architectures for 1-D integer DCT of different lengths. We also show that the proposed structure could be reusable for DCT of lengths 4, 8, 16, and 32 with a throughput of 32 DCT coefficients per cycle irrespective of the transform size. Moreover, the proposed architecture could be pruned to reduce the complexity of implementation substantially with only a marginal affect on the coding performance. We propose power-efficient structures for folded and full-parallel implementations of 2-D DCT. From the synthesis result, it is found that the proposed architecture involves nearly 14% less area-delay product (ADP) and 19% less energy per sample (EPS) compared to the direct implementation of the reference algorithm, on average, for integer DCT of lengths 4, 8, 16, and 32. Also, an additional 19% saving in ADP and 20% saving in EPS can be achieved by the proposed pruning algorithm with nearly the same throughput rate. The proposed architecture is found to support ultrahigh definition 7680 Ã— 4320 at 60 frames/s video, which is one of the applications of HEVC.","authors":["P.K.
