{"id":"275543945_Interactive_and_Creative_Learning_of_the_Adults","abstract":"Adults want to learn with pleasure, participating creatively in building their own knowledge. From this point of view, it is important to create opportunities to involve them in stimulating learning in a creative and interactive way. In this regard we propose a new concept, the interactive-creative learning, that we will define as an evolutionary process based on receptivity to the new experiences identified and resolved through exploration, deduction, analysis, synthesis, generalization, abstraction, concretization, focusing on achievement of the connections between meanings and requiring a deep intellectual, psychomotor, affective and volitional involvement. Within the interactive-creative learning, the adult discovers, imagines, builds and redefines the meanings, filtering them through the prism of his own personality and using higher mental processes of thought and creation. The individual who learns is active and able to permanently reorganize and restructure his own achievements, in a systemic vision.","authors":["Crenguţa Lăcrămioara Oprea"],"meta":["August 2014Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 142","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.654"],"references":["275543415_Motives_and_Beliefs_of_Learners_Enrolled_in_Adult_Education","257719032_Designing_an_English_Course_for_Adult_Non-philological_Students_in_Long-life_Learning_Education","258141242_Into_another_world_From_creativity_to_creative_learning"]}
