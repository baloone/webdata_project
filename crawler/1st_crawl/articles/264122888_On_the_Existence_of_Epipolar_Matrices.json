{"id":"264122888_On_the_Existence_of_Epipolar_Matrices","abstract":"This paper considers the foundational question of the existence of a\nfundamental (resp. essential) matrix given $m$ point correspondences in two\nviews. We present a complete answer for the existence of fundamental matrices\nfor any value of $m$. Using examples we disprove the widely held beliefs that\nfundamental matrices always exist whenever $m \\leq 7$. At the same time, we\nprove that they exist unconditionally when $m \\leq 5$. Under a mild genericity\ncondition, we show that an essential matrix always exists when $m \\leq 4$. We\nalso characterize the six and seven point configurations in two views for which\nall matrices satisfying the epipolar constraint have rank at most one.","authors":["Sameer Agarwal","Hon-leung Lee","Bernd Sturmfels","Rekha R.
