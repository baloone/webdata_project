{"id":"356144239_JOURNAL_OF_CRITICAL_REVIEWS_ALGORITHMIC_NARRATION_FOR_DEMYSTIFYING_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AND_ENGINEERING_UNDERGRADUATE_PROJECTS","abstract":"The importance of a well implemented academic project cannot be overemphasized,\nespecially in the area of Computer Science and Engineering. This work is aimed at making\nComputer Science and Engineering final year undergraduate projects easier for both the students\ninvolved and the supervisor. This key objective is achieved through the evolution of algorithmic\nnarrations. The four major areas covered are Research Abstracts, Literature Review, Introductory\nChapter, and Reference Section. The corresponding algorithms developed to achieve these are:\nResearch Abstracts Check Algorithm (RACA), Literature Bank Generation Algorithm (LBGA),\nIntroductory Chapter Check Algorithm (ICCA) and Partial Reference Review Algorithm\n(PRRA). This work is based on practical experiences of the researchers on academic project\nsupervision at both undergraduate and graduate levels, in Computer Science and Engineering. By\nway of evaluation, the algorithmic strategies presented in this work were applied in real life\nsupervision of six undergraduate projects between August 2020 and April 2021. The overall\nproject completion time is estimated to have been reduced by about 2 months, compared to the\noutcome of previous supervisions in the year 2019 to 2020. Thus, this work is expected to be\nvery useful to both students and supervisors involved in undergraduate Computer Science and\nEngineering projects.","authors":["Monday Eze","Deborah Aleburu","Ibrahim Ramon"],"meta":["November 2021Journal of Critical Reviews 8(2):2021"],"references":["349988648_Mathematics_Teachers'_Pedagogy_through_Technology_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","347476643_Blockchain_and_Supply_Chain_Management_A_New_Paradigm_for_Supply_Chain_Integration_and_Collaboration","346373173_Writing_Science_What_Makes_Scientific_Writing_Hard_and_How_to_Make_It_Easier","338951665_Blockchain_Current_Challenges_and_Future_ProspectsApplications","323558574_Writing_the_literature_review_for_empirical_papers","319501358_How_to_write_abstract_for_a_scientific_journal_article","319183983_Lean_Six_Sigma_Yesterday_Today_and_Tomorrow","310605384_Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages_Tools_for_Effective_Communication_on_Application's_User_Interface","287732329_Recommendations_about_nomenclature_for_papers_submitted_to_Zootaxa","324218971_Artificial_Intelligence_and_its_Role_in_Near_Future","251440561_Search_Engine_Optimization_SEO_as_a_Dynamic_Online_Promotion_Technique_The_Implications_of_Activity_Theory_for_Promotion_Managers","229124787_The_Effectiveness_of_Workflow_Management_Systems_Predictions_and_Lessons_Learned","223714691_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_An_Overview_of_Applications","278143505_Writing_a_research_article_advice_to_beginners","276433537_Performance_Evaluation_of_Real-Time_Systems"]}
