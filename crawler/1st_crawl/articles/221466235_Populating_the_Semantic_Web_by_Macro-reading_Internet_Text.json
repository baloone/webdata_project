{"id":"221466235_Populating_the_Semantic_Web_by_Macro-reading_Internet_Text","abstract":"A key question regarding the future of the semantic web is “how will we acquire structured information to populate the semantic\nweb on a vast scale?” One approach is to enter this information manually. A second approach is to take advantage of pre-existing\ndatabases, and to develop common ontologies, publishing standards, and reward systems to make this data widely accessible.\nWe consider here a third approach: developing software that automatically extracts structured information from unstructured\ntext present on the web. We also describe preliminary results demonstrating that machine learning algorithms can learn to\nextract tens of thousands of facts to populate a diverse ontology, with imperfect but reasonably good accuracy.","authors":["Matt Tom","Justin Betteridge","Andrew C.
