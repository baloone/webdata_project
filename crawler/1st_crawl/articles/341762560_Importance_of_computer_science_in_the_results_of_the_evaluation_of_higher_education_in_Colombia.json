{"id":"341762560_Importance_of_computer_science_in_the_results_of_the_evaluation_of_higher_education_in_Colombia","abstract":"Information and communication technologies have transformed social behavior into teaching and learning processes, however, it is debated whether greater access to technology influences the quality of knowledge acquired by undergraduate students. This article aims to determine the incidence of information technology and communication tools in the results obtained in the Saber Pro 2017-2018 tests by administration and related students; these tests are the exams that the Colombian state performs annually to determine the quality of higher education in public and private universities. The achievement of this objective was carried out through an analysis of variance that consists in evaluating if there are significant differences in the results, according to the students who have a computer, have access to the Internet and the time in hours dedicated to this. The analysis of variance left as the main conclusion that the use of Information and Communication Technologies increases the chances of improving the results obtained by students.","authors":["A M Rodriguez","B T Quintero","J A Moreno"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1513(1):012016","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1513/1/012016"],"references":["299547210_Factores_asociados_al_rendimiento_en_las_Pruebas_Saber_Pro_en_estudiantes_de_Ingenieria_Civil_en_universidades_colombianas","262445010_Proposal_for_Measuring_the_Impact_of_ICT_on_College_Teaching","341748134_Flexibilidad_curricular_revision_de_expectativas_en_el_programa_de_administracion_de_empresas_en_la_UFPSO","322278848_Las_Tic_en_la_educacion_superior_innovaciones_y_retos_The_ICT_in_higher_education_innovations_and_challenges","277172265_Tecnica_y_Globalizacion"]}
