{"id":"354583019_New_Quantum_Algorithms_using_Multi-Qubit_Interaction","abstract":"Searching whether an item is stored in an unsorted database of N items is a crucial issue in nowadays real world, computer science and engineering, applications. The complexity of this problem is O(N) and speed up quadratically, O(√ N), when using Grover's algorithm if N = 2 n , where n is the number of qubits that are used store the unsorted database. This letter shows that Grover's algorithm is inefficient for unsorted quantum databases of size N < 2 n items. In this letter, a novel quantum searching algorithm is proposed to check whether a given item is stored in a given unknown and unsorted database of N ≤ 2 n such that these states, items, are stored in a weighted/uniform superposition. The proposed search algorithm accomplishes this operation in polynomial time.","authors":["E El-Sanousy","Mohamed Tolan","Ibrahim Abouelsaad","Ayman Abd-Elhamed"],"meta":["September 2021Information Sciences Letters 10(3):445","DOI:10.18576/isl/100308"],"references":["348162485_An_optimized_quantum_minimum_searching_algorithm_with_sure-success_probability_and_its_experiment_simulation_with_Cirq","346621430_Non-Classical_Computing_Problems_Toward_Novel_Type_of_Quantum_Computing_Problems","335946716_Quantum_Classification_Algorithm_based_on_Competitive_Learning_Neural_Network_and_Entanglement_Measurement","335088712_A_Quantum_Algorithm_Based_on_Entanglement_Measure_for_Classifying_Boolean_Multivariate_function_into_Novel_Hidden_Classes","335020368_A_Novel_Autonomous_Perceptron_Model_for_Pattern_Classification_Applications","322212473_A_Novel_Algorithm_based_on_Entanglement_Measurement_for_Improving_Speed_of_Quantum_Algorithms","343946006_A_novel_quantum_computing_model_based_on_entanglement_degree","338285134_A_quantum_classification_algorithm_for_classification_incomplete_patterns_based_on_entanglement_measure","338147263_Event-Triggered_Synchronization_for_Neutral-Type_Semi-Markovian_Neural_Networks_With_Partial_Mode-Dependent_Time-Varying_Delays","336687155_An_analytical_solution_for_fractional_oscillator_in_a_resisting_medium","301848088_A_Review_on_Quantum_Search_Algorithms","292152502_An_Autonomous_Competitive_Learning_Algorithm_using_Quantum_Hamming_Neural_Networks","258287315_Optimization_of_Partial_Search","312685110_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","263979590_QUANTUM_SEARCH_ALGORITHMS"]}
