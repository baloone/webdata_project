In these problems, one asks to distinguish all vertices of a graph using\na subset of the vertices and either the neighborhood within the solution set or\nthe distances to the solution vertices. Using a general reduction for this\nclass of problems, we prove that the decision problems associated to these four\nnotions are NP-complete, even for graphs that are at the same time interval\ngraphs and permutation graphs and have diameter~2. On the other hand, we\ndescribe linear-time algorithms for cographs. We also give new upper bounds for\nthe order of a (unit) interval graph, a (bipartite) permutation graph or a\ncograph of given solution size to all these problems.","authors":["Florent Foucaud","George B.
