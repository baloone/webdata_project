Scr. 93 027002), it has been shown that the multiparty case in our proposed scheme in Abulkasim et al (2016 Phys. Scr. 91 085101) is not secure, where Bob and Charlie can deduce Alice's unitary operations without being detected. This reply shows a simple modification of the multiparty case to prevent the dishonest agents from performing this kind of attack.","authors":["Hussein Abulkasim","Safwat Helmy Hamad","Ahmed Atito Elhadad"],"meta":["February 2018Physica Scripta 93(2):027001","DOI:10.1088/1402-4896/aa9df3"],"references":["322341280_Comment_on_'Authenticated_quantum_secret_sharing_with_quantum_dialogue_based_on_Bell_states'","305272844_Authenticated_quantum_secret_sharing_with_quantum_dialogue_based_on_Bell_states"]}
