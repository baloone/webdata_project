{"id":"221102079_Urdu_and_Hindi_Translation_and_sharing_of_linguistic_resources","abstract":"Hindi and Urdu share a common phonol- ogy, morphology and grammar but are written in different scripts. In addition, the vocabularies have also diverged signif- icantly especially in the written form. In this paper we show that we can get rea- sonable quality translations (we estimated the Translation Error rate at 18%) between the two languages even in absence of a parallel corpus. Linguistic resources such as treebanks, part of speech tagged data and parallel corpora with English are lim- ited for both these languages. We use the translation system to share linguistic re- sources between the two languages. We demonstrate improvements on three tasks and show: statistical machine translation from Urdu to English is improved (0.8 in BLEU score) by using a Hindi-English parallel corpus, Hindi part of speech tag- ging is improved (upto 6% absolute) by using an Urdu part of speech corpus and a Hindi-English word aligner is improved by using a manually word aligned Urdu- English corpus (upto 9% absolute in F- Measure).","authors":["Karthik Visweswariah","Vijil Chenthamarakshan","Nanda Kambhatla"],"meta":["January 2010","SourceDBLP","Conference: COLING 2010, 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Posters Volume, 23-27 August 2010, Beijing, China","Project: Machine Translation"],"references":["250797503_Building_Feature_Rich_POS_Tagger_for_Morphologically_Rich_Languages_Experiences_in_Hindi","234830222_A_hybrid_Model_for_Urdu_Hindi_Transliteration","230875890_The_Mathematics_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Parameter_Estimation","228338741_Resources_for_urdu_language_processing","273256542_A_Dictionary_of_Urdu_Classical_Hindi_and_English","252300817_Developing_English-Urdu_Machine_Translation_Via_Hindi","245123229_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition","243772948_HMM_BasedWord_Alignment_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","227022836_Pivot_language_approach_for_phrase-based_statistical_machine_translation"]}
