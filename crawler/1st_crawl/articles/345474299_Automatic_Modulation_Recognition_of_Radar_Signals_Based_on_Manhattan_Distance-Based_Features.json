{"id":"345474299_Automatic_Modulation_Recognition_of_Radar_Signals_Based_on_Manhattan_Distance-Based_Features","abstract":"Feature-based (FB) algorithms for automatic modulation recognition of radar signals have received much attention since they are usually simple to realize. However, existing FB approaches usually focus on several specific modulations and fail when applied to various modulations. To overcome this issue, we propose a simple and effective FB algorithm based on Manhattan distance-based features (MDBFs) in this paper. MDBFs are new features for radar signals that can be applied for recognition of different modulations. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, radar signals are represented as wavelet ridges, which includes important information that can distinguish different modulations, and the piecewise aggregate approximation algorithm is introduced to reduce signal dimensions. Then, the dynamic time warping averaging is employed instead of the traditional k-means algorithm to extract realistic centroids for each class. Finally, the Manhattan distances between each data sample and each centroid are used to construct MDBFs, and decisions are made using the k-nearest neighbor. In addition, we prove that MDBFs have better class separability power than the Euclidean-based features. MDBFs contain information about the correlations between different classes, which means that these features suitable for discriminating various modulations when their class distributions do not overlap badly in representation space. The extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed method and are hardly affected by the pulse width of the signal. Thus, the proposed method with the effectiveness and robustness could be a promising modulation recognition method of the radar signal.","authors":["Yingkun Huang","Weidong Jin","Bing Li","Peng Ge"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access 7:41193-41204","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907159"],"references":["336809089_Modulation_scheme_recognition_using_convolutional_neural_network","329421667_Automatic_Modulation_Classification_Exploiting_Hybrid_Machine_Learning_Network","329229597_A_New_Discriminative_Collaborative_Neighbor_Representation_Method_for_Robust_Face_Recognition","325228352_Radar_emitter_identification_with_bispectrum_and_hierarchical_extreme_learning_machine","323810884_Modulation_Signal_Recognition_Based_on_Information_Entropy_and_Ensemble_Learning","322783830_Automatic_Radar_Waveform_Recognition_Based_on_Deep_Convolutional_Denoising_Auto-encoders","318235814_Intra-pulse_modulation_recognition_using_short-time_ramanujan_Fourier_transform_spectrogram","309099757_LPI_Radar_Waveform_Recognition_Based_on_Time-Frequency_Distribution","308840761_Radar_signal_recognition_based_on_time-frequency_representations_and_multidimensional_probability_density_function_estimator","308044854_Autonomous_radar_pulse_modulation_classification_using_modulation_components_analysis","302345943_Dynamic_time_warping_averaging_of_time_series_allows_faster_and_more_accurate_classification","296634868_Robust_Radar_Emitter_Recognition_Based_on_the_Three-Dimensional_Distribution_Feature_and_Transfer_Learning","262317734_A_high_performance_centroid-based_classification_approach_for_language_identification","257879728_Distance-based_features_in_pattern_classification","220716931_Comparison_of_Distance-Based_Features_for_Hand_Geometry_Authentication","220601732_A_global_averaging_method_for_dynamic_time_warping_with_applications_to_clustering","48166584_Experimental_Comparison_of_Representation_Methods_and_Distance_Measures_for_Time_Series_Data","330230986_Recognition_Algorithm_of_Emitter_Signals_Based_on_PCACNN","329956037_Modulation_Recognition_using_Wavelet-assisted_Convolutional_Neural_Network","326999806_A_generalized_mean_distance-based_k-nearest_neighbor_classifier","326284136_Deep_learning_in_electronic_warfare_systems_Automatic_intra-pulse_modulation_recognition","324550480_Automatic_Modulation_Classification_of_Radar_Signals_Using_the_Pseudo_Margenau-Hill_Distribution","324051417_Radar_Emitter_Recognition_Based_on_SIFT_Position_and_Scale_Features","323672453_Radar_emitter_recognition_based_on_the_short_time_fourier_transform_and_convolutional_neural_networks","321405962_Automatic_intra-pulse_modulation_recognition_using_support_vector_machines_and_genetic_algorithm","320603460_Robust_intra-pulse_modulation_recognition_via_sparse_representation","317724307_Automatic_radar_waveform_recognition_based_on_time-frequency_analysis_and_convolutional_neural_network","317631311_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Automatic_Cognitive_Radio_Waveform_Recognition","313549322_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Under_Limited_Warping_Path_Length","313544844_Automatic_IntraPulse_Modulation_Classification_of_Advanced_LPI_Radar_Waveforms","312963470_Deep_learning-based_automated_modulation_classification_for_cognitive_radio","312926102_Adaptive_cost_dynamic_time_warping_distance_in_time_series_analysis_for_classification","309589235_Radar_signal_recognition_based_on_ambiguity_function_features_and_cloud_model_similarity","308263678_Dimensionality_reduction_for_fast_similarity_search_in_large_time_series_databases","301647811_Convolutional_Radio_Modulation_Recognition_Networks","283812547_Recognition_of_Radar_Emitter_Signals_Based_on_SVD_and_AF_Main_Ridge_Slice","265544297_Supervised_Machine_Learning_A_Review_of_Classification_Techniques","257518404_A_distance_sum-based_hybrid_method_for_intrusion_detection","253611941_Automatic_Modulation_Classification_Using_Combination_of_Genetic_Programming_and_KNN","225325653_An_Approach_to_Intra-Pulse_Modulation_Recognition_Based_on_the_Ambiguity_Function","224057791_Autonomous_Time-Frequency_Morphological_Feature_Extraction_Algorithm_for_LPI_Radar_Modulation_Classification","44636232_Wavelet_ridge_techniques_in_optical_fringe_pattern_analysis","3481429_Automatic_Radar_Waveform_Recognition","3479904_Survey_of_automatic_modulation_classification_techniques_Classical_approaches_and_new_trends","3452206_Determination_of_Wavelet_Ridges_of_Nonstationary_Signals_by_Singular_Value_Decomposition","2548217_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Fast_Similarity_Search_in_Large_Time_Series_Databases"]}
