{"id":"327039299_Soil_porosity_modelling_for_immersive_serious_game_based_on_vertical_angle_depth_and_speed_of_tillage","abstract":"The real data support the “seriousness” of the serious game and give more authentic situations, which can make players feel immersed in scenarios, and gain a real experience. Therefore, the modeler must be able to recognize whether a model reflects reality to identify and deal with divergences between theory and data. In this paper, we present a model for design a basis of immersive in serious games. The studied case is the tillage using a moldboard plow, by taking real data through an experiment use a device called soil bin. It aims to determine the effect of angle, depth, and speed on the soil porosity; by comparing the value of the smallest error using the polynomial function of the use of different orders. The result of an average smallest error with the polynomial approach is 1.10E-07 in the 3rd order, closer to the experimental value. Therefore, the model can be used for designing immersive serious game.","authors":["Anang Kukuh Adisusilo","Mohamad Hariadi","Eko mulyanto Yuniarno","Bambang Purwantana"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Advances in Intelligent Informatics 4(2):107","DOI:10.26555/ijain.v4i2.215","Project: immersive Serious game for soil tillage"],"references":[]}
