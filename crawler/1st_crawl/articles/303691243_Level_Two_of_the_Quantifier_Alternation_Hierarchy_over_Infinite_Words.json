{"id":"303691243_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_over_Infinite_Words","abstract":"The study of various decision problems for logic fragments has a long history in computer science. This paper is on the membership problem for a fragment of first-order logic over infinite words; the membership problem asks for a given language whether it is definable in some fixed fragment. The alphabetic topology was introduced as part of an effective characterization of the fragment \\(\\varSigma _2\\) over infinite words. Here, \\(\\varSigma _2\\) consists of the first-order formulas with two blocks of quantifiers, starting with an existential quantifier. Its Boolean closure is \\(\\mathbb {B}\\varSigma _2\\). Our first main result is an effective characterization of the Boolean closure of the alphabetic topology, that is, given an \\(\\omega \\)-regular language L, it is decidable whether L is a Boolean combination of open sets in the alphabetic topology. This is then used for transferring Place and Zeitounâ€™s recent decidability result for \\(\\mathbb {B}\\varSigma _2\\) from finite to infinite words.","authors":["Manfred Kufleitner","Tobias Walter"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-34171-2_16","Conference: International Computer Science Symposium in Russia"],"references":["285458778_Quantifier_Alternation_for_Infinite_Words","282072691_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_Over_Infinite_Words","225953511_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Infinite_Words","221221854_Topologies_Refining_the_Cantor_Topology_on_Xo","309091937_Quantifier_Alternation_for_Infinite_Words","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","261952337_Going_Higher_in_the_First-Order_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_on_Words","258082322_One_Quantifier_Alternation_in_First-Order_Logic_with_Modular_Predicates","243677621_Finite_semigroup_varieties_of_the_form_V_D","242378722_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","238698002_Decision_Problems_for_omega-Automata","234800941_Automata_on_Infinite_Objects","228558368_A_variety_theorem_without_complementation","222445123_Classifying_regular_events_in_symbolic_logic","222437820_The_dot-depth_hierarchy_of_star-free_languages_is_infinite","220287283_Automatentheoretische_und_automatenfreie_Charakterisierungen_topologischer_Klassen_regularer_Folgenmengen","220246385_Testing_and_Generating_Infinite_Sequences_by_a_Finite_Automaton","220180354_A_Survey_on_Small_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Finite_Words","48176545_First-order_Fragments_with_Successor_over_Infinite_Words","2509286_Locally_Threshold_Testable_Languages_of_Infinite_Words"]}
