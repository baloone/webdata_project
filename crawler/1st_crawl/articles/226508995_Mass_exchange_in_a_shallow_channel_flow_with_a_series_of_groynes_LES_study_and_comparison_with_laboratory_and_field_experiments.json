{"id":"226508995_Mass_exchange_in_a_shallow_channel_flow_with_a_series_of_groynes_LES_study_and_comparison_with_laboratory_and_field_experiments","abstract":"The exchange of dissolved matter between a straight open channel and a series of shallow embayments present at one of its\nsides is investigated using large eddy simulation (LES). The direct link between the mechanism of mass exchange and the dynamics\nof coherent structures is demonstrated. It is shown that for the geometrical configuration considered in the present study,\nthe mass exchange process is very non-uniform over the depth in the vicinity of the channel–embayment interface. Most of the\ncontaminant is ejected from the embayments close to the free surface. The amount of contaminant re-entrained into the embayments\nsituated downstream of the one in which contaminant was introduced is quantified. The mass exchange coefficient predicted\nby LES does not vary significantly with the embayment rank and is in very good agreement with the one predicted by the model\nproposed by Weitbrecht etal. (J Hydraul Eng 134(2):173–183, 2008) based on the value of a dimensionless morphometric groyne-field\nparameter. Field experiments were purposely performed in a natural stream with embayments whose length over width ratios were\nclose to the ratio in the LES study. The concentration fields predicted by LES are compared with video-records of colored\ndye used to visualize the mass exchange in the field experiment. It is shown that, for both LES and the field experiment,\nthe dominant passage frequency of the eddies inside the interfacial mixing layer is well predicted by the analytical model\nof Sukhodolov and Sukhodolova (in: Cowen etal (eds) Hydraulic measurements & experimental methods. Proceedings of international\nconference, Lake Placid, USA, pp 172–177, 2007). The model is then used to scale the time in the LES animations and field\nvideo-records showing the temporal evolution of the concentration field. The results of the comparison indicate several similarities\nin the mixing process, despite the differences in the bathymetry and the large difference in the Reynolds number between LES\nand the field experiment. This proves the usefulness of performing detailed LES and laboratory studies in well-controlled\nenvironments to understand mass-exchange processes around river groyne fields.","authors":["George Constantinescu","Alexander Sukhodolov","Andrew Willam McCoy"],"meta":["December 2009Environmental Fluid Mechanics 9(6):587-615","DOI:10.1007/s10652-009-9155-2"],"references":["252503970_An_investigation_of_the_dynamics_of_coherent_structures_in_a_turbulent_channel_flow_with_a_vertical_sidewall_obstruction","251425671_An_investigation_of_the_flow_and_scour_mechanisms_around_isolated_spur_dikes_in_a_shallow_open_channel_2_Conditions_corresponding_to_the_final_stages_of_the_erosion_and_deposition_process","248809098_An_investigation_of_the_flow_and_scour_mechanisms_around_isolated_spur_dikes_in_a_shallow_open_channel_1_Conditions_corresponding_to_the_initiation_of_the_erosion_and_deposition_process","248808955_Nature_of_flow_and_turbulence_structure_around_an_in-stream_vertical_plate_in_a_shallow_channel_and_the_implications_for_sediment_erosion","238391012_A_numerical_investigation_of_coherent_structures_and_mass_exchange_processes_in_channel_flow_with_two_lateral_submerged_groynes","228743641_Flow_Structure_at_Different_Stages_in_a_Meander-Bend_with_Bendway_Weirs","227630443_A_Strategy_to_Assess_River_Restoration_Success","45834374_Flow_and_bathymetry_in_sharp_open-channel_bends_Experiments_and_predictions","326812779_Stoffdynamik_und_Habitatstruktur_in_der_Elbe","253179421_Large-Eddy_Simulation_of_Reacting_Turbulent_Flows_in_Complex_Geometries","249281209_A_study_of_phytoplankton_spatial_distributions_flow_structure_and_characteristics_of_mixing_in_a_river_reach_with_groynes","245357264_Assessment_of_Predictive_Capabilities_of_Detached_Eddy_Simulation_to_Simulate_Flow_and_Mass_Transport_Past_Open_Cavities","245297594_Three-Dimensional_and_Depth-Averaged_Large-Eddy_Simulations_of_Some_Shallow_Water_Flows","245297551_Purging_of_a_Neutrally_Buoyant_or_a_Dense_Miscible_Contaminant_from_a_Rectangular_Cavity_II_Case_of_an_Incoming_Fully_Turbulent_Overflow","245296829_Exchange_Processes_between_a_River_and_Its_Groyne_Fields_Model_Experiments","239389537_Coherent_Structures_in_the_Flow_Field_around_a_Circular_Cylinder_with_Scour_Hole","239389521_Experiments_on_Mass_Exchange_between_Groin_Fields_and_Main_Stream_in_Rivers","239389519_Numerical_Investigation_of_Flow_Hydrodynamics_in_a_Channel_with_a_Series_of_Groynes","239389389_Case_Study_Turbulent_Flow_and_Sediment_Distributions_in_a_Groyne_Field","235171544_Statistical_Fluid_Mechanics_The_Mechanics_of_Turbulence","231807159_Analysis_of_the_flow_and_mass_transfer_processes_for_the_incompressible_flow_past_an_open_cavity_with_a_laminar_and_a_fully_turbulent_incoming_boundary_layer","229645981_On_the_correspondence_between_morphological_and_hydrodynamical_patterns_of_groyne_fields","227992785_Ecology_of_Braided_Rivers","225752372_Exchange_Processes_in_a_Channel_with_Two_Vertical_Emerged_Obstructions","222674505_Concepts_of_Decision_Support_for_River_Rehabilitation","222668483_Large_scale_PIV-measurements_at_the_surface_of_shallow_water_flows","222545068_A_numerical_method_for_large-eddy_simulation_in_complex_geometries","32138411_PIV_Measurements_of_side-cavity_open-channel_flows_-Wando_model_in_rivers-"]}
