{"id":"256326897_API_design_for_machine_learning_software_Experiences_from_the_scikit-learn_project","abstract":"Scikit-learn is an increasingly popular machine learning li- brary. Written\nin Python, it is designed to be simple and efficient, accessible to\nnon-experts, and reusable in various contexts. In this paper, we present and\ndiscuss our design choices for the application programming interface (API) of\nthe project. In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared\nby all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its\nadvantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on\nimplementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles\nfaced by users and developers of the library.","authors":["Lars Buitinck","Gilles Louppe","Mathieu Blondel","Fabian Pedregosa"],"meta":["September 2013","SourcearXiv","Project: scientific software"],"references":["258729397_Introduction_to_astroML_Machine_learning_for_astrophysics","255820377_Software_Framework_for_Topic_Modelling_with_Large_Corpora","225876490_Orange_From_Experimental_Machine_Learning_to_Interactive_Data_Mining","224223550_The_NumPy_Array_A_Structure_for_Efficient_Numerical_Computation","224176310_Cython_The_Best_of_Both_Worlds","290483761_Large_scale_learning_to_rank","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","262395872_Random_Search_for_Hyper-Parameter_Optimization","257618440_Block_coordinate_descent_algorithms_for_large-scale_sparse_multiclass_classification","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines"]}
