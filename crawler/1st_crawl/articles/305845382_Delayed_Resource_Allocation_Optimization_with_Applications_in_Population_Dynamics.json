{"id":"305845382_Delayed_Resource_Allocation_Optimization_with_Applications_in_Population_Dynamics","abstract":"The contribution of this paper is twofold. First a simplified derivation of the maximum principle for optimal control problems with delay is presented based on first principles. Then the result is applied to an investigation into the dynamic optimal resource allocation problem in population dynamics involving delayed action.","authors":["Erik Verriest","G.
