The complexity of the FPTAS is \n\n$O$\n((\n\n$n^{4}/\\upvarepsilon $\n)log(\n\n$n$\n/\n\n$\\upvarepsilon $\n)), where \n\n$n$\nis the number of jobs. In this note we suggest another pseudo-polynomial algorithm that can be converted to a new FPTAS which improves Shabtay–Bensoussan’s complexity result and runs in \n\n$O(n^{3}/\\upvarepsilon )$\ntime.","authors":["Amir Elalouf","Eugene Levner","Huajun Tang"],"meta":["August 2013Journal of Scheduling 16(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10951-013-0320-6","Project: Emergency Evacuation in Macau"],"references":["220366615_Maximizing_the_weighted_number_of_just-in-time_jobs_in_several_two-machine_scheduling_systems","261845626_Single_machine_scheduling_to_minimize_the_number_of_early_and_tardy_jobs","256416877_Fast_approximation_algorithm_for_job_sequencing_with_deadlines","230595985_Optimization_and_Approximation_in_Deterministic_Sequencing_and_Scheduling_A_Survey","230595724_Approximation_Schemes_for_the_Restricted_Shortest_Path_Problem","226766901_Maximizing_the_weighted_number_of_just-in-time_jobs_in_flow_shop_scheduling","222835065_A_Simple_Efficient_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Restricted_Shortest_Path_Problem","220921007_Efficient_Routing_of_Mobile_Agents_for_Agent-Based_Integrated_Enterprise_Management_A_General_Acceleration_Technique","220349168_An_Improved_FPTAS_for_Mobile_Agent_Routing_with_Time_Constraints","220111890_An_improved_FPTAS_for_restricted_shortest_path"]}
