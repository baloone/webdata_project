{"id":"336802284_Degrees_of_L-Continuity_for_Mappings_between_L-Topological_Spaces","abstract":"By means of the residual implication on a frame L, a degree approach to L-continuity and L-closedness for mappings between L-cotopological spaces are defined and their properties are investigated systematically. In addition, in the situation of L-topological spaces, degrees of L-continuity and of L-openness for mappings are proposed and their connections are studied. Moreover, if L is a frame with an order-reversing involution ′ , where b ′ = b → ⊥ for b ∈ L , then degrees of L-continuity for mappings between L-cotopological spaces and degrees of L-continuity for mappings between L-topological spaces are equivalent.","authors":["Zhenyu Xiu","Qinghua Li"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7111013"],"references":["335166889_A_degree_approach_to_relationship_among_fuzzy_convex_structures_fuzzy_closure_systems_and_fuzzy_Alexandrov_topologies","333329416_A_categorical_approach_to_abstract_convex_spaces_and_interval_spaces","331491069_p-Topologicalness-A_Relative_Topologicalness_in_-Convergence_Spaces","326385713_A_degree_approach_to_special_mappings_between_M-fuzzifying_convex_spaces","335278133_Coreflectivities_of_L_M-fuzzy_convex_structures_and_L_M-fuzzy_cotopologies_in_L_M-fuzzy_closure_systems","335011114_Convergence_structures_in_M_-fuzzifying_convex_spaces","334901436_Degrees_of_special_mappings_in_the_theory_of_L-convex_spaces","329670453_Relations_among_L_M-fuzzy_convex_structures_L_M-fuzzy_closure_systems_and_L_M-fuzzy_Alexandrov_topologies_in_a_degree_sense","326822622_An_axiomatic_approach_to_bases_and_subbases_in_L_-convex_spaces_and_their_applications","325456608_Lattice-valued_convergence_associated_with_CNS_spaces"]}
