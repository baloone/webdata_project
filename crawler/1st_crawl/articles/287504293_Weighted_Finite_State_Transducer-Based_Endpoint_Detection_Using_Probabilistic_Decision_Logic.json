{"id":"287504293_Weighted_Finite_State_Transducer-Based_Endpoint_Detection_Using_Probabilistic_Decision_Logic","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the use of data-driven probabilistic utterance-level decision logic to improve Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST)-based endpoint detection. In general, endpoint detection is dealt with using two cascaded decision processes. The first process is frame-level speech/non-speech classification based on statistical hypothesis testing, and the second process is a heuristic-knowledge-based utterance-level speech boundary decision. To handle these two processes within a unified framework, we propose a WFST-based approach. However, a WFST-based approach has the same limitations as conventional approaches in that the utterance-level decision is based on heuristic knowledge and the decision parameters are tuned sequentially. Therefore, to obtain decision knowledge from a speech corpus and optimize the parameters at the same time, we propose the use of data-driven probabilistic utterance-level decision logic. The proposed method reduces the average detection failure rate by about 14% for various noisy-speech corpora collected for an endpoint detection evaluation.","authors":["Hoon Chung","Sung Joo Lee","Yun Keun Lee"],"meta":["October 2014Etri Journal 36(5):714-720","DOI:10.4218/etrij.14.2214.0030"],"references":["224762165_A_voice_activity_detection_based_on_the_adaptive_integration_of_multiple_speech_features_and_signal_decision_scheme","3342424_A_statistical_model_based_voice_activity_detector","289049907_Endpoint_detection_using_weighted_finite_state_transducer","284568674_Intra-_and_Inter-frame_Features_for_Automatic_Speech_Recognition","261126056_Recurrent_neural_networks_for_voice_activity_detection","228640291_OpenFst_A_general_and_efficient_weighted_finite-state_transducer_library","224439857_Statistical_model-based_voice_activity_detection_using_support_vector_machine","224169890_Long-Term_Spectro-Temporal_and_Static_Harmonic_Features_for_Voice_Activity_Detection","221568098_OpenFst_A_General_and_Efficient_Weighted_Finite-State_Transducer_Library","220736276_Integration_of_sporadic_noise_model_in_POMDP-based_voice_activity_detection","4003470_Applying_support_vector_machines_to_voice_activity_detection","3343331_Statistical_voice_activity_detection_using_a_multiple_observation_likelihood_ratio_test","1958000_Weighted_Automata_in_Text_and_Speech_Processing"]}
