{"id":"317485196_A_Way_How_to_Impart_Data_Science_Skills_to_Computer_Science_Students_Exemplified_by_OBDA-Systems_Development","abstract":"Nowadays to explore and examine data from a variety of angles to tackle Big Data problems, to devise data-driven solutions to the most pressing challenges, it is necessary to build multidisciplinary students’ skills set for innovative methods not only for master’s in Data Science programs but in traditional Computer Science programs also. In the paper, we describe how teaching methods and tools, which are used to train students to develop Ontology-Based Data Access systems with natural language interface to relational databases helps Master’s Degree students in Computer Science to collaborate with Data Scientists in real-world interdisciplinary projects and to prepare them for a data science career. We use ontology engineering in a combination with Natural Language Processing methods based on lexico-syntactic patterns, in particular, to extract needful data from structured, semi-structured and unstructured datasets in a uniform way to analyze real-world Russian social networks related to new building area.","authors":["Svetlana Chuprina","Igor Postanogov","Taisya Kostareva"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 108:2161-2170","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.191","Project: Ontolis 2.0"],"references":["314100405_Similarity_Measures_for_Semantic_Relation_Extraction","303746242_Ontology_Based_Data_Access_Methods_to_Teach_Students_to_Transform_Traditional_Information_Systems_and_Simplify_Decision_Making_Process","301659293_Using_ontology-based_adaptable_scientific_visualization_and_cognitive_graphics_tools_to_transform_traditional_information_systems_into_intelligent_systems","277919457_Steps_towards_Bridging_the_HPC_and_Computational_Science_Talent_Gap_Based_on_Ontology_Engineering_Methods","221303651_Lexico-Syntactic_Patterns_for_Automatic_Ontology_Building","303746240_Using_Ontology_Engineering_Methods_to_Improve_Computer_Science_and_Data_Science_Skills","221101345_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora","2237791_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora"]}
