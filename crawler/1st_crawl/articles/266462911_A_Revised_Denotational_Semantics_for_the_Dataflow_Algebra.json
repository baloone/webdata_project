{"id":"266462911_A_Revised_Denotational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"Previously a version of the abstract syntax for the dataflow algebra has been defined that is based on a simpler and more appropriate model of the underlying semantic domain than the one used in the original definition of the algebra. Also a denotational semantics for the algebra has been presented, as part of the same report, which corresponded to this simplified abstract syntax. This report corrects an error that had been identified in that denotational semantics, by describing a counter-example which illustrates the nature of that, and then defining a new version of the denotational semantics that avoids this error, and also simplifies some aspects of the definition of the semantics. The report then goes on to show that this corrected version of the denotational semantics is complete and consistent with the axioms of the algebra.","authors":["A J Cowling"],"meta":[],"references":["246701183_Linking_Dataflow_Algebra_with_the_CaDiZ_tool","245839576_Dataflow_Algebras_as_Formal_Specifications_of_Data_Flows","242427043_Using_Dataflow_Algebra_as_a_Specification_Method","242427042_An_Operational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","242426966_A_Simplified_Abstract_Syntax_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","224001303_The_Z_Notation_a_Reference_Manual"]}
