{"id":"308939145_Mutual_rankings","abstract":"This paper analyzes some ranking methods in two-sided settings through their axiomatization. In these settings, there are two sets (the sides) and each member of one side evaluates each member of the other side. Such settings with mutual evaluations abound, for instance between buyers and sellers, students and teachers, or individuals and clubs.","authors":["Gabrielle Demange"],"meta":["October 2016Mathematical Social Sciences 90","DOI:10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2016.09.006"],"references":["271748112_Interlocking_Directorates_and_Interest_Group_Formation","262155756_An_Axiomatic_Approach_to_Proportionality_Between_Matrices","228108272_Ranking_the_Participants_in_a_Tournament","222799230_Citation_influence_for_journal_aggregates_of_scientific_publications_Theory_with_application_to_the_literature_of_physics","222212892_Network_Analysis_of_Two_Mode_Data","309078134_Assessing_the_relative_impacts_of_economic_journals_Journal_of_Economic_Literature","265242592_Competitive_economy_as_a_ranking_device_over_networks","241759146_A_ranking_method_based_on_handicaps","240273786_Technique_for_Analyzing_Overlapping_Group_Memberships","229124516_Power_and_Centrality_A_Family_of_Measures","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","223198374_Simultaneous_Group_and_Individual_Centralities","222465442_Centrality_in_Affiliation_Networks","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220289393_The_outflow_ranking_method_for_weighted_directed_graphs","215665433_On_Dividing_an_Amount_According_to_Individual_Claims_or_Liabilities","24064606_Scoring_of_web_pages_and_tournaments_-_Axiomatizations","4975667_Impartial_division_of_a_dollar","4898105_Potential_Value_and_Consistency","4816044_The_Measurement_of_Intellectual_Influence"]}
