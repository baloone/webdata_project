{"id":"261475165_Latency-Bounded_Target_Set_Selection_in_Social_Networks","abstract":"We study variants of the Target Set Selection problem, first proposed by Kempe et al. In our scenario one is given a graph G = (V,E), integer values t(v) for each vertex v, and the objective is to determine a small set of vertices (target set) that activates a given number (or a given subset) of vertices of G\nwithin a prescribed number of rounds. The activation process in G proceeds as follows: initially, at round 0, all vertices in the target set are activated; subsequently at each round r ≥ 1 every vertex of G becomes activated if at least t(v) of its neighbors are active by round r − 1. It is known that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality Target Set that eventually activates the whole graph G is hard to approximate to a factor better than \\(O(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon }|V|})\\). In this paper we give exact polynomial time algorithms to find minimum cardinality Target Sets in graphs of bounded clique-width, and exact linear time algorithms for trees.","authors":["Ferdinando Cicalese","Gennaro Cordasco","Luisa Gargano","Martin Milanic"],"meta":["March 2013Theoretical Computer Science 535","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2014.02.027","SourcearXiv"],"references":["246803611_Memory_and_Decision_Making","233371791_Targeting_Young_Voters_in_a_Political_Campaign_Empirical_Insights_into_an_Interactive_Digital_Marketing_Campaign_in_the_2007_Finnish_General_Election","225522247_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","222562039_On_time_versus_size_for_monotone_dynamic_monopolies_in_regular_topologies","221668488_Target_Set_Selection_Problem_for_Honeycomb_Networks","220896997_Influential_Nodes_in_a_Diffusion_Model_for_Social_Networks","220770037_Finding_Branch-Decompositions_and_Rank-Decompositions","220752828_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220668776_Exact_Algorithms_for_a_Loading_Problem_with_Bounded_Clique_Width","220659114_Limited_Memory_Categorization_and_Competition","220617906_Finding_Branch-Decompositions_and_Rank-Decompositions","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","51962607_The_Target_Set_Selection_Problem_on_Cycle_Permutation_GraphsGeneralized_Petersen_Graphs_and_Torus_Cordalis","51959911_Some_Results_on_the_Target_Set_Selection_Problem","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","266707982_Variants_of_Spreading_Messages","262399814_Constant_Thresholds_Can_Make_Target_Set_Selection_Tractable","258818395_Parameterized_Approximability_of_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_in_Networks","258699512_Influence_Diffusion_in_Social_Networks_under_Time_Window_Constraints","257000606_Counting_truth_assignments_of_formulas_of_bounded_tree-width_or_clique-width","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","241770312_Cheap_easy_and_massively_effective_viral_marketing_in_social_networks_Truth_or_fiction","237092150_Contagious_Sets_in_Expanders","231175688_Minimum_Weight_Dynamo_and_Fast_Opinion_Spreading","225573312_On_the_Relationship_between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","223529096_Edge_dominating_set_and_colorings_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","222571771_Treewidth_Governs_the_Complexity_of_Target_Set_Selection","222434550_Approximating_clique-width_and_branch-width","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","222134019_Local_majorities_coalitions_and_monopolies_in_graphs_A_review","220779599_On_the_Approximability_of_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220752980_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220693394_Networks_Crowds_and_Markets_Reasoning_About_A_Highly_Connected_World","220657734_On_time_versus_size_for_monotone_dynamic_monopolies_in_regular_topologies","220618462_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220617303_Intractability_of_Clique-Width_Parameterizations","220567232_On_Bounded-Degree_Vertex_Deletion_parameterized_by_treewidth","220533445_On_the_Approximability_of_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220153387_Algorithms_for_vertex-partitioning_problems_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","220151624_Combinatorial_model_and_bounds_for_target_set_selection","220149922_Irreversible_conversion_of_graphs","50292012_On_dynamic_monopolies_of_graphs_with_general_thresholds","47866174_On_the_approximability_and_exact_algorithms_for_vector_domination_andrelated_problems_in_graphs","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers"]}
