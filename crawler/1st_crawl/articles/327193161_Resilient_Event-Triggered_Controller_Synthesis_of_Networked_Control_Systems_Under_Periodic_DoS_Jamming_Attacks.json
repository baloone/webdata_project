{"id":"327193161_Resilient_Event-Triggered_Controller_Synthesis_of_Networked_Control_Systems_Under_Periodic_DoS_Jamming_Attacks","abstract":"In this paper, the event-based controller synthesis problem for networked control systems under the resilient event-triggering communication scheme (RETCS) and periodic denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks is studied. First, a new periodic RETCS is designed under the assumption that the DoS attacks imposed by power-constrained pulsewidth-modulated jammers are partially identified, that is, the period of the jammer and a uniform lower bound on the jammer's sleeping periods are known. Second, a new state error-dependent switched system model is constructed, including the impacts of the RETCS and DoS attacks. According to this new model, the exponential stability criteria are derived by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional. In these criteria, the relationship among DoS parameters, the triggering parameters, the sampling period, and the decay rate is quantitatively characterized. Then, a criterion is also proposed to obtain the explicit expressions of the triggering parameter and event-based state feedback controller gain simultaneously. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are verified by a satellite yaw-angles control system.","authors":["Songlin Hu","Dong Yue","Xiang-Peng Xie","Xiaoli Chen"],"meta":["August 2018IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99):1-11","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2018.2861834"],"references":["318219557_MPH-M_AODV-M_and_DSR-M_performance_evaluation_under_jamming_attacks","308990435_Model-based_resilient_control_for_a_multi-agent_system_against_Denial_of_Service_attacks","224220545_Optimal_Control_in_the_Presence_of_an_Intelligent_Jammer_with_Limited_Actions","221422380_Safe_and_Secure_Networked_Control_Systems_under_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","4358538_Secure_Control_Towards_Survivable_Cyber-Physical_Systems","325277488_Event-based_robust_stabilization_of_uncertain_networked_control_systems_under_quantization_and_denial-of-service_attacks","322454553_A_Threshold-Parameter-Dependent_Approach_to_Designing_Distributed_Event-Triggered_H_Consensus_Filters_Over_Sensor_Networks","322449103_Decentralized_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Secure_Control_for_Nonlinear_Uncertain_Interconnected_Systems_Against_Intermittent_DoS_Attacks","317691779_Resilient_control_of_networked_control_systems_with_stochastic_denial_of_service_attacks","316472826_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Switched_Systems_With_Application_to_Networked_Control_Under_Jamming_Attacks","315320609_Guest_Editorial_Special_Issue_on_Secure_Control_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems","314194101_Resilient_control_under_Denial-of-Service_Robust_design","313957281_Reliable_Output_Feedback_Control_for_T-S_Fuzzy_Systems_With_Decentralized_Event_Triggering_Communication_and_Actuator_Failures","311919283_Stabilization_of_Neural-Network-Based_Control_Systems_via_Event-Triggered_Control_With_Nonperiodic_Sampled_Data","311163985_On_Triggering_Control_of_Single-Input_Linear_Systems_Under_Pulse-Width_Modulated_DoS_Signals","309604286_Security_Control_for_Discrete-Time_Stochastic_Nonlinear_Systems_Subject_to_Deception_Attacks","309118339_An_Overview_and_Deep_Investigation_on_Sampled-Data-Based_Event-Triggered_Control_and_Filtering_for_Networked_Systems","308766476_Networked_control_of_nonlinear_systems_under_Denial-of-Service","308533671_Event-Triggered_Control_Systems_Under_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","305037205_Observer-Based_Event-Triggering_Consensus_Control_for_Multiagent_Systems_With_Lossy_Sensors_and_Cyber-Attacks","304018042_Networked_Control_Under_Random_and_Malicious_Packet_Losses","303714014_Delay-independent_stabilization_of_a_class_of_time-delay_systems_via_periodically_intermittent_control","302919109_Recent_Advances_on_Filtering_and_Control_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems_under_Security_and_Resource_Constraints","301437056_Resilient_Control_under_Denial-Of-Service","301300731_Event-Triggered_Fault_Detection_of_Nonlinear_Networked_Systems","298902402_Resilient_Control_of_Networked_Control_System_Under_DoS_Attacks_A_Unified_Game_Approach","294723414_Robust_Filtering_for_a_Class_of_Networked_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Switching_Communication_Channels","284709775_A_Switched_System_Approach_to_Exponential_Stabilization_of_Sampled-Data_T-S_Fuzzy_Systems_With_Packet_Dropouts","283193189_A_Higher_Energy_Efficient_Sampling_Scheme_for_Networked_Control_Systems_over_IEEE_802154_Wireless_Networks","282352940_Resilient_control_in_the_presence_of_DoS_attack_Switched_system_approach","281675387_Optimal_DoS_Attack_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networked_Control_System","277607377_Input-to-State_Stabilizing_Control_Under_Denial-of-Service","276153006_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Backstepping_Control_for_A_Class_of_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Sampled_and_Delayed_Measurements","273393677_Cyberphysical_Security_in_Networked_Control_Systems_An_Introduction_to_the_Issue","265200639_Periodic_Event-Triggered_Control_for_Linear_Systems","261051855_On_event-triggered_control_of_linear_systems_under_periodic_denial-of-service_jamming_attacks","260661768_A_Delay_System_Method_for_Designing_Event-Triggered_Controllers_of_Networked_Control_Systems","260648225_Multi-Agent_Based_Hierarchical_Hybrid_Control_for_Smart_Microgrid","256660898_Periodic_event-triggered_control_for_linear_systems","224440136_To_Zero_or_to_Hold_Control_Inputs_With_Lossy_Links","224098496_Stabilization_of_Sampled-Data_Control_Systems_With_Control_Inputs_Missing"]}
