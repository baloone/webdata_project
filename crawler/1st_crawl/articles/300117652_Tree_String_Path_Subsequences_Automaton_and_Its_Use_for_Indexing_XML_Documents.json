{"id":"300117652_Tree_String_Path_Subsequences_Automaton_and_Its_Use_for_Indexing_XML_Documents","abstract":"The theory of indexing texts is well-researched, which does not hold for indexing other data structures, such as trees for example. In this paper a simple method of indexing a tree for subsequences of string paths in the tree by finite automaton is presented. The use of the index is shown on indexing XML documents for XPath descendant-or-self axis inspired queries. Given a subject tree \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) with n nodes, the tree is preprocessed and an index, which is a directed acyclic subsequence graph for a set of strings, is constructed. The searching phase uses the index, reads an input string path subsequence \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) inspired by the specific XPath query of size m and computes the list of positions of all occurrences of \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) in the tree \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). The searching is performed in time \\(\\mathcal {O}(m)\\) and does not depend on n. Although the number of distinct valid queries is \\(\\mathcal {O}(2^n)\\), the size of the index is \\(\\mathcal {O}(h^k)\\), where h is the height of the tree \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and k is the number of its leaves. Moreover, we discuss that in the case of indexing a common XML document the size of the index is even smaller \\(\\mathcal {O}(h \\cdot 2^k)\\).","authors":["Eliška Šestáková","Jan Janoušek"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-27653-3_17","Conference: International Symposium on Languages, Applications and Technologies"],"references":["221559751_Containment_and_Equivalence_for_an_XPath_Fragment","221322232_Index_Structures_for_Path_Expressions","221213005_APEX_an_adaptive_path_index_for_XML_data","220966506_Hierarchical_Indexing_Approach_to_Support_XPath_Queries","220965096_PRIX_Indexing_and_querying_XML_using_prufer_sequences","200034493_Containment_and_Equivalence_for_a_Fragment_of_XPath","2559838_ViSt_A_Dynamic_Index_Method_for_Querying_XML_Data_by_Tree_Structures","314801196_APEX_an_adaptive_path_index_for_XML_data","268862803_Algorithms_on_strings_Translated_from_the_2001_French_original","266860543_Arbology_Trees_and_pushdown_automata","265766924_A_Full_and_Linear_Index_of_a_Tree_for_Tree_Patterns","225516798_Reasoning_about_keys_for_XML","223316549_The_smallest_automaton_recognizing_the_subwords_of_a_text","221580080_On_the_size_of_DASG_for_multiple_texts","221000283_MTree_an_XML_XPath_graph_index","220657902_Directed_acyclic_subsequence_graph-Overview","220155269_Searching_Subsequences","3871333_Online_construction_of_subsequence_automata_for_multiple_texts","2601406_Index_Structures_for_Path_Expressions","2487373_DataGuides_Enabling_Query_Formulation_and_Optimization_in_Semistructured_Databases","2477923_Covering_Indexes_for_Branching_Path_Queries","2383116_Indexing_and_Querying_XML_Data_for_Regular_Path_Expressions","2239430_Online_Construction_of_Subsequence_Automata_for_Multiple_Texts"]}
