{"id":"257356409_Emergency_resources_demand_prediction_using_case-based_reasoning","abstract":"The demand prediction on emergency resources is the premise and basis of optimal allocation of emergency resources. Nowadays, there are only few researches on this aspect in China and abroad. For this reason, the paper aims at the characteristics of emergency resource demand prediction and presents a method for emergency resource demand prediction using case-based reasoning (CBR), which is also a method based on risk analysis. This prediction method cannot only provide a basis for emergency resource reserve and allocation in future, but also provide a method and model support for the emergency resources allocation decision-making system to be constructed in future.","authors":["Wenmao Liu","Guangyu Hu","Jianfeng Li"],"meta":["March 2012Safety Science 50(3):530â€“534","DOI:10.1016/j.ssci.2011.11.007"],"references":["228597526_A_knowledge-intensive_integrated_approach_to_problem_solving_and_sustained_learning","222436867_Heuristic_Classification","220816256_Combining_Case-Based_and_Rule-Based_Reasoning_A_Heuristic_Approach","2273368_Similarity_Uncertainty_and_Case-Based_Reasoning_in_PATDEX","313705801_Arguing_by_Analogy_in_Law_a_case_based_model_Analogical_Reasoning_pp","298126634_Case-based_design_support_Supporting_architectural_composition_through_precedent_libraries","291049834_Maintenance_and_maintainability_in_regulation_based_systems","265669428_Exemplar-based_knowledge_acquisition_A_unified_approach_to_concept_representation_classification_and_learning","243777889_Towards_robust_expert_systems_that_learn_from_experience_-_An_architectural_framework","239667269_A_rule-rule-case_based_system_for_image_analysis","239064879_PROTOS_An_experiment_in_knowledge_acquisition_for_heuristic_classification_tasks","230876454_Scripts_Plans_Goals_and_Understanding","228595530_Challenges_of_massive_parallelism","227954587_The_client-centred_approach_expert_system_development","227875074_Client-centred_approach_expert_system_maintenance","225070349_Creativity_and_learning_in_a_case-based_explainer","222449023_Maintaining_Organization_in_a_Dynamic_Long-Term_Memory","222437799_Reconstructive_Memory_A_Computer_Model","221112499_REFINER_A_Case-Based_Differential_Diagnosis_Aide_for_Knowledge_Acquisition_and_Knowledge_Refinement","220836953_Where's_the_Beef_The_Absence_of_Pragmatic_Factors_in_Pragmatic_Theories_of_Analogy","30873583_Precedents_Memory_Structure_in_Design_Case_Libraries","3584642_A_case-based_reasoning_system_for_regulatory_information","3584637_Case_based_reasoning_for_decision_support_in_engineering_design","3584527_Developing_case-based_reasoning_systems_a_case_study_in_diagnosing_building_defects"]}
