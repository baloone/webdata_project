{"id":"346783666_Statistical_Physics_for_Medical_Diagnostics_Learning_Inference_and_Optimization_Algorithms","abstract":"It is widely believed that cooperation between clinicians and machines may address many of the decisional fragilities intrinsic to current medical practice. However, the realization of this potential will require more precise definitions of disease states as well as their dynamics and interactions. A careful probabilistic examination of symptoms and signs, including the molecular profiles of the relevant biochemical networks, will often be required for building an unbiased and efficient diagnostic approach. Analogous problems have been studied for years by physicists extracting macroscopic states of various physical systems by examining microscopic elements and their interactions. These valuable experiences are now being extended to the medical field. From this perspective, we discuss how recent developments in statistical physics, machine learning and inference algorithms are coming together to improve current medical diagnostic approaches.","authors":["Abolfazl Ramezanpour","Andrew Lane Beam","Jonathan H Chen","Alireza Mashaghi"],"meta":["November 2020Diagnostics 10(11)","DOI:10.3390/diagnostics10110972"],"references":["341919233_Disease_evolution_in_reaction_networks_Implications_for_a_diagnostic_problem","340098074_Future_of_health_diagnostics","336908692_Key_challenges_for_delivering_clinical_impact_with_artificial_intelligence","332969661_Is_the_future_of_medical_diagnosis_in_computer_algorithms","332581695_The_multiplex_network_of_human_diseases","329540263_Multi-experiment_nonlinear_mixed_effect_modeling_of_single-cell_translation_kinetics_after_transfection","337803345_Machine_learning_and_the_physical_sciences","337407165_High-throughput_phenotyping_with_electronic_medical_record_data_using_a_common_semi-supervised_approach_PheCAP","330203267_High-performance_medicine_the_convergence_of_human_and_artificial_intelligence","328200067_Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare"]}
