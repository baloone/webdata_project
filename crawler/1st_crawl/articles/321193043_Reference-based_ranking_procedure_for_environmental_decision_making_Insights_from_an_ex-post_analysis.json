{"id":"321193043_Reference-based_ranking_procedure_for_environmental_decision_making_Insights_from_an_ex-post_analysis","abstract":"Preference elicitation is a challenging activity in any decision-making process, yet preferences are fundamental since the recommendations are meaningful and acceptable only if the Decision Maker's values are taken into account. This study proposes an ex-post application of a recent ranking method named Simple Ranking with Multiple Points (S-RMP) to support a participatory decision-making process. The method has been tested on a real-world case study simulating the selection of the most suitable site for locating a new landfill. The purpose of the research is twofold: (i) to explore the applicability and relevance of the S-RMP method to support environmental decision-making processes and (ii) to provide guidelines for the elicitation of preference parameters of the S-RMP ranking method. The results highlight that the proposed method opens a promising line of research in the environmental decision-making domain, thanks to its ability to use heterogeneous information consistently with the increasing amount of qualitative data embedded in real decision-making processes.","authors":["Valentina Ferretti","Jinyan Liu","Vincent Mousseau","Wassila Ouerdane"],"meta":["January 2018Environmental Modelling and Software 99:11-24","DOI:10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.09.009","Project: Preference"],"references":["348161503_Preference_elicitation_for_a_ranking_method_based_on_multiple_reference_profiles","277689392_Preference_elicitation_and_learning","277666953_Thematic_issue_on_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Water_Resources","321474081_A_Multicriteria_Spatial_Decision_Support_System_Development_for_Siting_a_Landfill_in_the_Province_of_Torino_Italy","304535150_Big_data_The_management_revolution","298074683_Multicriteria_analysis_for_sustainability_assessment_Concepts_and_case_studies","291950175_Key_challenges_and_Meta-choices_in_Designing_and_Applying_Multi-Criteria_Spatial_Decision_Support_Systems","282447607_Behavioural_issues_in_environmental_modelling_-_The_missing_perspective","276275927_Mathematics_Without_Numbers","276155181_Elicitation_of_criteria_importance_weights_through_the_Simos_method_A_robustness_concern"]}
