{"id":"8379547_Artificial_intelligence_in_medicine","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science capable of analysing complex medical data. Their potential to exploit meaningful relationship with in a data set can be used in the diagnosis, treatment and predicting outcome in many clinical scenarios.\nMedline and internet searches were carried out using the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'neural networks (computer)'. Further references were obtained by cross-referencing from key articles. An overview of different artificial intelligent techniques is presented in this paper along with the review of important clinical applications.\nThe proficiency of artificial intelligent techniques has been explored in almost every field of medicine. Artificial neural network was the most commonly used analytical tool whilst other artificial intelligent techniques such as fuzzy expert systems, evolutionary computation and hybrid intelligent systems have all been used in different clinical settings.\nArtificial intelligence techniques have the potential to be applied in almost every field of medicine. There is need for further clinical trials which are appropriately designed before these emergent techniques find application in the real clinical setting.","authors":["A N Ramesh","Chandra Kambhampati","John RT Monson","Philip Drew"],"meta":["October 2004Annals of The Royal College of Surgeons of England 86(5):334-8","DOI:10.1308/147870804290","SourcePubMed"],"references":["244947191_1974_Beyond_regression_New_tools_for_predicting_and_analysis_in_the_behavioral_sciences","234849296_Computerized_analysis_of_mammographic_microcalcifications_in_morphological_and_texture_feature_spaces","261855478_On_mafiology","242919009_Use_of_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_Data_Analysis_in_Clinical_Decision-Making_The_Diagnosis_of_Acute_Coronary_Occlusion","242356870_Adaptation_In_Natural_And_Artificial_Systems","227796587_Evaluation_of_new_self-learning_techniques_for_the_generation_of_criteria_for_differentiation_of_wide-QRS_tachycardia_in_supraventricular_tachycardia_and_ventricular_tachycardia","227795301_Sonographic_prediction_of_malignancy_in_adnexal_masses_using_an_artificial_neural_network","227768176_Artificial_neural_networks_improve_the_accuracy_of_cancer_survival_prediction","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","224982284_A_logical_Calculus_of_Ideas_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity"]}
