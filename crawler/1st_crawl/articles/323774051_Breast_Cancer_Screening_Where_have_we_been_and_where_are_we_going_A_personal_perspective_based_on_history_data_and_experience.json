Since the randomized, controlled trials have shown a statistically significant mortality reduction for women ages 40-74, the appropriate threshold for initiating screening is age 40 with no data to support the use of the age of 50 as a threshold for screening. All women are at risk for developing breast cancer and all women should have access to screening.","authors":["Daniel Kopans"],"meta":["March 2018Clinical Imaging 48:vii-xi","DOI:10.1016/j.clinimag.2017.12.016"],"references":["317049661_The_Canadian_National_Breast_Screening_Studies_are_compromised_and_their_results_are_unreliable_They_should_not_factor_into_decisions_about_breast_cancer_screening","277410788_Conclusions_for_mammography_screening_after_25-year_follow-up_of_the_Canadian_National_Breast_Cancer_Screening_Study_CNBSS","21732803_Canadian_National_Breast_Screening_Study_2_Breast_cancer_detection_and_death_rates_among_women_aged_50_to_59_years","267745537_A_Reality_Check_for_Overdiagnosis_Estimates_Associated_With_Breast_Cancer_Screening","266570290_Pan-Canadian_Study_of_Mammography_Screening_and_Mortality_from_Breast_Cancer","229522638_Benefits_versus_risks_from_mammography_A_critical_reasessment","51699466_Just_the_Facts_Mammography_Saves_Lives_With_Little_If_Any_Radiation_Risk_To_the_Mature_Breast","45827690_Radiation_Doses_and_Cancer_Risks_from_Breast_Imaging_Studies","44698398_The_2009_US_Preventive_Services_Task_Force_Guidelines_Ignore_Important_Scientific_Evidence_and_Should_Be_Revised_or_Withdrawn_1","22049411_Mammography_A_Contrary_View","21561379_Author_of_Canadian_Breast_Cancer_Study_Retracts_Warnings","18732976_Analysis_of_462_breast_carcinomas","17129107_Simultaneous_Electrical_Recording_of_Independent_and_Summated_Eye_Movements","16392880_Breast_cancer_detection_demonstration_project_five-year_summary_report_Ca-A","15094350_Report_of_International_Workshop_on_Screening_for_Breast_Cancer","14591024_Assessment_of_radiation_risk_from_screening_mammography","14110436_NCI_Adopts_New_Mammography_Screening_Guidelines_For_Women"]}
