{"id":"276837946_Learning_Automata-Based_Adaptive_Petri_Net_and_Its_Application_to_Priority_Assignment_in_Queuing_Systems_With_Unknown_Parameters","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive Petri net (PN), capable of adaptation to environmental changes, is introduced by the fusion of learning automata and PN. In this new model, called learning automata-based adaptive PN (APN-LA), learning automata are used to resolve the conflicts among the transitions. In the proposed APN-LA model, transitions are portioned into several sets of conflicting transitions and each set of conflicting transitions is equipped with a learning automaton which is responsible for controlling the conflicts among transitions in the corresponding transition set. We also generalize the proposed APN-LA to ASPN-LA which is a fusion between LA and stochastic PN (SPN). An application of the proposed ASPN-LA to priority assignment in queuing systems with unknown parameters is also presented.","authors":["S Mehdi Vahidipour","Mohammad Reza Meybodi","Mehdi Esnaashari"],"meta":["October 2015IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems 45(10):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2015.2406764"],"references":["266860206_Understanding_Petri_nets_Modeling_techniques_analysis_methods_case_studies_Translated_from_the_German_by_the_author","256707300_Corrections_to_Nonpure_Petri_Net_Supervisors_for_Optimal_Deadlock_Control_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems_Mar_13_252-265","255787199_Extended_Distributed_Learning_AutomataA_New_Method_for_Solving_Stochastic_Graph_Optimization_Problems","228642467_A_learning_automata-based_algorithm_for_determination_of_the_number_of_hidden_units_for_three-layer_neural_networks","226969002_A_Survey_of_Petri_Net_Methods_for_Controlled_Discrete_Event_Systems","5600617_Possibilistic_Petri_nets","3021777_Control_of_vector_discrete-event_systems_II_Controller_synthesis","321500320_Networks_of_Learning_Automata","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","283379798_Erratum_Nonpure_petri_net_supervisors_for_optimal_deadlock_control_of_flexible_manufacturing_systems_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_Systems_2013_432_252-265","278695647_A_Novel_Community_Detection_Algorithm_for_Privacy_Preservation_in_Social_Networks","276315805_Extended_distributed_learning_automata","268545570_Control_of_Petri_Nets_by_Finite_Automata","266656677_Modeling_Self-Adaptive_Software_Systems_With_Learning_Petri_Nets","264580191_Learning_automata_with_changing_number_of_actions_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_SMG171095-1100","264199190_Decreasing_Impact_of_SLA_ViolationsA_Proactive_Resource_Allocation_Approachfor_Cloud_Computing_Environments","261444838_Last-Position_Elimination-Based_Learning_Automata","259515579_Sampling_from_complex_networks_using_distributed_learning_automata","257674281_Deployment_of_a_mobile_wireless_sensor_network_with_k-coverage_constraint_A_cellular_learning_automata_approach","257451429_Formalized_learning_automata_with_adaptive_fuzzy_coloured_Petri_net_an_application_specific_to_managing_traffic_signals","256721034_Finding_minimum_weight_connected_dominating_set_in_stochastic_graph_based_on_learning_automata","255671959_Ordered_Firing_in_Petri_Nets","250893247_An_estimator_algorithm_for_learning_automata_with_changing_number_of_actions","247674766_Supervision_of_Petri_Nets","247529299_Simulation_and_Control_of_Flexible_Manufacturing_Systems_A_Petri_Net_Approach","243700887_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete_Event_System_Using_Petri_Nets","243475630_Priority_Assignment_in_Waiting_Line_Problems","241269986_Automated_Generation_and_Analysis_of_Markov_Reward_Models_Using_Stochastic_Reward_Nets","224757831_Structured_analysis_for_neural_networks_using_Petri_nets","222703970_A_probabilistic_priority_scheduling_discipline_for_multi-service_networks","222442471_An_Investigation_Of_Controls_For_Concurrent_Systems_Based_On_Abstract_Control_Languages","222411955_A_learning_automata_based_scheduling_solution_to_the_dynamic_point_coverage_problem_in_wireless_sensor_networks","222169363_Coloured_Petri_Nets_and_the_Invariant-Method","220693649_Learning_Automata_An_Introduction","220692138_Queueing_Networks_and_Markov_Chains_Modeling_and_Performance_Evaluation_With_Computer_Science_Applications_Second_Edition","220653845_Modeling_with_Generalized_Stochastic_Petri_Nets","220593129_Learning_automata-based_dynamic_guard_channel_algorithms","220575808_A_Learning_Automata-Based_Cognitive_Radio_for_Clustered_Wireless_Ad-Hoc_Networks","220279600_Errata_to_Flexible_neuro-fuzzy_systems","220197979_On_the_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_with_Static_Priorities","215439783_Petri_Net_Theory_und_the_Modeling_of_a_System","4153920_Making_Petri_nets_adaptive_A_critical_review","3996860_Automatic_synthesis_of_neural_networks_using_learning_automata","3749459_Integration_of_knowledge-based_systems_and_neural_networks_neuro-expert_Petri_net_models_and_applications","3705508_Intelligent_hybrid_multi-agent_architecture_for_engineering_complex_systems","3530138_On_the_complexity_of_forbidden_state_problems_for_controlled_marked_graphs","3412282_Fuzzy_Reasoning_Petri_Nets","3296171_Knowledge_representation_using_fuzzy_Petri_nets","3217586_Special_section_on_fusion_of_neural_nets_fuzzy_systems_and_genetic_algorithms_in_industrial_applications","3113799_Fuzzy_Petri_Nets_for_Rule_Based_Decision_making","2731033_Controlled_Petri_Nets_A_Tutorial_Survey","2447368_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_with_a_Dynamic_Priority_Method","2984167_Analysis_and_Applications_Proceedings_of_the_IEEE_774_541-580"]}
