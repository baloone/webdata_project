{"id":"344034146_High_School_Teachers'_Self-efficacy_in_Teaching_Computer_Science","abstract":"Self-efficacy is an important construct for CS teachers’ professional development, because it can predict both teaching behaviors as well as student outcomes. Research has shown that teachers’ self-efficacy can be as influential as their actual level of knowledge and abilities. However, there has been very limited research on CS teachers’ self-efficacy. This study describes the development and implementation of an instrument that measures secondary school teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching computer science. Teachers attended a nineweek hybrid professional development program and completed the computer science teaching self-efficacy instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the self-efficacy instrument, which can be potentially used in other CS education settings. The results also indicated that teachers’ self-efficacy in the content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge dimensions of teaching computer science significantly increased from participating in the professional development program.","authors":["Ninger Zhou","Ha Nguyen","Christian Fischer","Debra Richardson"],"meta":["September 2020ACM Transactions on Computing Education 20(3):1-18","DOI:10.1145/3410631"],"references":["326503061_Adapting_to_the_Large-Scale_Advanced_Placement_Chemistry_Reform_An_Examination_of_Teachers'_Challenges_and_Instructional_Practices","322838097_Adapting_to_large-scale_changes_in_Advanced_Placement_Biology_Chemistry_and_Physics_the_impact_of_online_teacher_communities","318791331_How_much_professional_development_is_needed_with_educative_curriculum_materials_It_depends_upon_the_intended_student_learning_outcomes","306310055_Teacher_Stress_and_Teacher_Self-Efficacy_as_Predictors_of_Engagement_Emotional_Exhaustion_and_Motivation_to_Leave_the_Teaching_Profession","324385271_An_experimental_study_of_a_museum-based_science_PD_programme's_impact_on_teachers_and_their_students","316566774_On_the_quest_for_validity_Testing_the_factor_structure_and_measurement_invariance_of_the_technology-dimensions_in_the_Technological_Pedagogical_and_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_model","313925103_Effects_of_a_Multimedia_Professional_Development_Package_on_Inclusive_Science_Teachers'_Vocabulary_Instruction","310617832_Education_Growing_computer_science_education_into_a_STEM_education_discipline","308846015_Starting_from_scratch_Developing_a_pre-service_teacher_training_program_in_computational_thinking","306244372_European_management_research_using_partial_least_squares_structural_equation_modeling_PLS-SEM"]}
