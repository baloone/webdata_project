{"id":"277947102_Innovation_in_HCI_What_Can_we_Learn_from_Design_Thinking","abstract":"Design thinking, a methodology originating from the design disciplines, oriented towards problem solving through a human-centered approach, rapid prototyping and abductive reasoning, has huge impact on innovation in business, education, health and other crucial domains. Many similarities, and differences, can be found between design thinking and a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design approach to innovation. The aim of the workshop is to explore these similarities and differences, with a goal of rethinking possibilities, including combining practices towards increased impact of HCI in shaping innovative technologies for the future.","authors":["Alma Leora Culén","Asbjørn Følstad"],"meta":["October 2014","Conference: NORDICHI 2014, Workshop on Innovation in HCI: What Can we Learn from Design Thinking?"],"references":["273062443_Creating_Competitive_Advantage_in_IT-Intensive_Organizations_A_Design_Thinking_Perspective","264595739_Incremental_and_Radical_Innovation_Design_Research_vs_Technology_and_Meaning_Change","239857060_Design_Things_and_Design_Thinking_Contemporary_Participatory_Design_Challenges","314480720_The_Design_of_Business_Why_Design_Thinking_Is_the_Next_Competitive_Edge","292765298_Sketching_User_Experience_Getting_the_Design_Right_and_the_Right_Design","262399319_Practices_as_a_Unit_of_Design_An_Exploration_of_Theoretical_Guidelines_in_a_Study_on_Bathing","259823371_Design_Thinking_Integrating_Innovation_Customer_Experience_and_Brand_Value","248504444_Sketching_Designing_User_Experiences_Getting_the_Design_Right_and_the_Right_Design","237131145_Open_Innovation_The_New_Imperative_for_Creating_and_Profiting_fromTechnology","235700989_Change_by_Design_How_Design_Thinking_Transforms_Organizations_and_Inspires_Innovation"]}
