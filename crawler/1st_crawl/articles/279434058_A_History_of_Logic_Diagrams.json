{"id":"279434058_A_History_of_Logic_Diagrams","abstract":"Diagrams, however we may define them, are one of the most widely used tools by humans - from ordinary life communication to brainstorming for complicated problems or outlining the overall structure of talks, papers, etc. Some philosophers and psychologists extend the territory of diagrams by embracing mental images under the same category. Diagrams, external or internal, cover such a vast area of human activities that different disciplines, not surprisingly, have approached the topic from different angles.","authors":["Amirouche Moktefi","Sun-Joo Shin"],"meta":["January 2012Handbook of the History of Logic 11:611-682","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-52937-4.50011-3","In book: Handbook of the History of Logic, vol. 11: 'Logic: A History of its Central Concepts' (pp.611-682)Publisher: North-HollandEditors: Dov M.
