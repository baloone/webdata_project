{"id":"330450961_Haptic_Augmented_Reality_HapticAR_for_assembly_guidance","abstract":"The use of Augmented Reality (AR) to support assembly tasks has been an area of interest from its origins in the 90s. Since then, the benefits that this technology could bring to assembly-related tasks have been shown. And, although several advances have been done in different areas such as software, hardware, and human interaction, there are still some problems that have not allowed AR to expand and reach its full potential. Thereby, authors propose a real-time vibrotactile guidance method based on the Gestalt continuity principle and developed a Haptic Augmented Reality application with a low-cost configuration to evaluate the support of the proposed method in assembly tasks. Thus, it potentially overcomes the existing visual issues of AR allowing the user to focus on the task and avoid over-reliance into the technology. The proposed system recognizes the different parts and sub-assemblies, generates the instructions to perform the assembly based on the target position and rotation of each part and verifies the assembly. Additionally, a test was conducted to guide the user in positioning a part, obtaining a high accuracy of rotation and location placement. Also, different functions of the application were tested and the results are suitable for supporting the user guidance.","authors":["Juan Carlos Arbelaez","Roberto Viganò","Gilberto Osorio-Gómez"],"meta":["June 2019International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM) 13(6)","DOI:10.1007/s12008-019-00532-3","Project: Industrial Augmented Reality (IAR)"],"references":["323556519_Natural_interface_for_interactive_virtual_assembly_in_augmented_reality_using_Leap_Motion_Controller","301299467_Augmenting_sensorimotor_control_using_goal-aware_vibrotactile_stimulation_during_reaching_and_manipulation_behaviors","286447504_Object_Recognition_in_Assembly_Assisted_by_Augmented_Reality_System","328983151_Visually_Impaired_Users_can_Locate_and_Grasp_Objects_Under_the_Guidance_of_Computer_Vision_and_Non-Visual_Feedback","319748231_The_Interaction_a_New_Way_of_Designing","318993654_A_Phantom-Sensation_Based_Paradigm_for_Continuous_Vibrotactile_Wrist_Guidance_in_2D_Space","318373723_A_systematic_review_of_augmented_reality_applications_in_maintenance","315400804_Augmented_reality_in_the_psychomotor_phase_of_a_procedural_task","290198147_A_comprehensive_survey_of_augmented_reality_assembly_research","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants"]}
