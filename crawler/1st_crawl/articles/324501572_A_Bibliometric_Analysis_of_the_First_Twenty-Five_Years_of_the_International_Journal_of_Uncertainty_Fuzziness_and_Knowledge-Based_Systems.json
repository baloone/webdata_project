{"id":"324501572_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_First_Twenty-Five_Years_of_the_International_Journal_of_Uncertainty_Fuzziness_and_Knowledge-Based_Systems","abstract":"Since the International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems published its first issue in 1993, it has made important contributions to the research field of computer science. In this study, based on the dataset of the publications published in this journal between 1993 and 2016 retrieved from Web of Science, a general overview of this journal is performed using bibliometric methods and visualized networks. First, the productive and influential publications, authors, institutions, countries/territories, and supraregions are analysed based on the total number of citations, publications, and different citation thresholds. Second, network visualization analysis is applied to illustrate the links and connections between terms by using the VOSviewer software. Moreover, the most cited journals and common author keywords of three continents, including North America, Europe, and Asia, are also presented. This paper will hopefully help researchers understand the research patterns of this journal.","authors":["Ruby W. Wang","Sigifredo Laengle","Jose M.
