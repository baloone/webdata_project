{"id":"259017543_Solitary_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_wave_equations","abstract":"A method is proposed for obtaining traveling-wave solutions of nonlinear\nwave equations that are essentially of a localized nature. It is based\non the fact that most solutions are functions of a hyperbolic tangent.\nThis technique is straightforward to use and only minimal algebra is\nneeded to find these solutions. The method is applied to selected cases.","authors":["W.
