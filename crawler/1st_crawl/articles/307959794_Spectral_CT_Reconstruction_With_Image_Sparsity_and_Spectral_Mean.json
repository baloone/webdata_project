{"id":"307959794_Spectral_CT_Reconstruction_With_Image_Sparsity_and_Spectral_Mean","abstract":"Photon-counting detectors can acquire x-ray intensity data in different energy bins. The signal-to-noise ratio of resultant raw data in each energy bin is generally low due to the narrow bin width and quantum noise. To address this problem, here we propose an image reconstruction approach for spectral CT to simultaneously\nreconstruct x-ray attenuation coefficients in all the energy bins. Because the measured spectral data are highly correlated among the x-ray energy bins, the intraimage sparsity and interimage similarity are important prior knowledge for image reconstruction. Inspired by this observation, the total variation and\nspectral mean measures are combined to improve the quality of reconstructed images. For this purpose, a linear mapping function is used to minimalize image differences between energy bins. The split Bregman technique is applied to perform image reconstruction. Our numerical and experimental results show that the\nproposed algorithms outperform competing iterative algorithms in this context.","authors":["Yi Zhang","Yan Xi","Qingsong Yang","Wenxiang Cong"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging 2(4):510-523","DOI:10.1109/TCI.2016.2609414"],"references":["303027223_Spectral_X-Ray_CT_Image_Reconstruction_with_a_Combination_of_Energy-Integrating_and_Photon-Counting_Detectors","301770342_Spectral_CT_Image_Restoration_via_an_Average_Image-Induced_Nonlocal_Means_Filter","283758155_Spectral_CT_reconstruction_using_image_sparsity_and_spectral_correlation","273833702_Energy_Window_Optimization_for_X-Ray_K-Edge_Tomographic_Imaging","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","311557611_Statistical_iterative_reconstruction_using_adaptive_fractional_order_regularization","310239705_Spectral_computed_tomography","301822646_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1_regularized_problems","295893652_Statistical_iterative_reconstruction_using_adaptive_fractional_order_regularization","281226172_Dual-_and_Multi-Energy_CT_Principles_Technical_Approaches_and_Clinical_Applications"]}
