{"id":"339663348_Towards_optimize-ESA_for_text_semantic_similarity_A_case_study_of_biomedical_text","abstract":"Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is an approach to measure the semantic relatedness between terms or documents based on similarities to documents of a references corpus usually Wikipedia. ESA usage has received tremendous attention in the field of natural language processing NLP and information retrieval. However, ESA utilizes a huge Wikipedia index matrix in its interpretation by multiplying a large matrix by a term vector to produce a high-dimensional vector. Consequently, the ESA process is too expensive in interpretation and similarity steps. Therefore, the efficiency of ESA will slow down because we lose a lot of time in unnecessary operations. This paper propose enhancements to ESA called optimize-ESA that reduce the dimension at the interpretation stage by computing the semantic similarity in a specific domain. The experimental results show clearly that our method correlates much better with human judgement than the full version ESA approach.","authors":["Khaoula Mrhar","Mounia Abik"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering 10(3):2934~2943","DOI:10.11591/ijece.v10i3.pp2934-2943"],"references":["333538318_Arabic_named_entity_recognition_using_deep_learning_approach","329468461_Developing_corpora_using_word2vec_and_wikipedia_for_word_sense_disambiguation","326628426_Text_Mining_for_Pest_and_Disease_Identification_on_Rice_Farming_with_Interactive_Text_Messaging","319504010_BIOSSES_a_semantic_sentence_similarity_estimation_system_for_the_biomedical_domain","303878333_Large_scale_biomedical_texts_classification_A_kNN_and_an_ESA-based_approaches","279261519_Sentence_Similarity_by_Combining_Explicit_Semantic_Analysis_and_Overlapping_N-Grams","275541552_Econo-ESA_Reduction_Scheme_and_the_Impact_of_its_Index_Matrix_Density","333370081_Toward_semantic_similarity_measure_between_concepts_in_an_ontology","320150940_A_graph-based_semantic_relatedness_assessment_method_combining_wikipedia_features","290197369_Wikipedia-based_semantic_interpreter_using_approximate_top-k_processing_and_its_application"]}
