{"id":"304366400_An_algorithm_for_a_class_of_split_feasibility_problems_application_to_a_model_in_electricity_production","abstract":"We propose a projection algorithm for solving split feasibility problems involving paramonotone equilibria and convex optimization. The proposed algorithm can be considered as a combination of the projection ones for equilibrium and convex optimization problems. We apply the algorithm for finding an equilibrium point with minimal environmental cost for a model in electricity production. Numerical results for the model are reported.","authors":["Le Hai Yen","Le Dung Muu","Nguyen Thanh Huyen"],"meta":["December 2016Mathematical Methods of Operations Research 84(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00186-016-0553-1","Project: Huyen NTT"],"references":["274855371_A_strong_convergence_theorem_for_equilibrium_problems_and_split_feasibility_problems_in_Hilbert_space","263048124_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Space","260837729_On_split_common_fixed_point_problems","259640551_On_extragradient-viscosity_methods_for_solving_equilibrium_and_fixed_point_problems_in_a_Hilbert_space","258012087_Solving_Proximal_Split_Feasibility_Problems_without_prior_knowledge_of_operator_norms","257697714_A_hybrid_subgradient_algorithm_for_nonexpansive_mappings_and_equilibrium_problems","315573860_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Spaces","267464768_From_optimization_and_variational_inequalities_to_equilibrium_problems","265702607_On_some_properties_of_paramonotone_operators","251342004_Iterative_Projection_Methods_in_Biomedical_Inverse_Problems","236843898_Solving_the_split_feasibility_problem_without_prior_knowledge_of_matrix","236331617_Solving_Proximal_Split_Feasibility_Problems_without_prior_knowledge_of_operator_norms","238123241_An_extragradient_method_for_finding_saddle_points_and_other_problems","236736823_Variational_Analysis","233807537_Existence_and_solution_methods_for_equilibria"]}
