{"id":"342418450_Encrypting_Wireless_Communications_On_the_Fly_Using_One-Time_Pad_and_Key_Generation","abstract":"The one time pad (OTP) secure transmission relies on the random keys to achieve perfect secrecy, while the unpredictable wireless channel is shown to be a good random source. There is very few work of the joint design of OTP and key generation from wireless channels. This paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative investigation on secure transmission achieved by OTP and wireless channel randomness. We propose two OTP secure transmission schemes, i.e., Identical Key-based Physical-layer Secure Transmission (IK-PST) and Un-identical Key-based Physical-layer Secure Transmission (UK-PST). We quantitatively analyze the performance of both schemes and prove that UK-PST outperforms IK-PST. We extend the pairwise schemes to a group of users in networks with star and chain topologies. We implement prototypes of both schemes and evaluate the proposed schemes through both simulations and experiments. The results verify that UK-PST has a higher effective secret transmission rate than that of IK-PST for scenarios with both pairwise and group users.","authors":["Li Guyue","Zheying Zhang","Junqing Zhang","Aiqun Hu"],"meta":["June 2020IEEE Internet of Things Journal PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JIOT.2020.3004451","Project: Key Generation From Wireless Channels"],"references":["336455766_Experimental_Investigation_on_Wireless_Key_Generation_for_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks","334461100_A_Hybrid_Information_Reconciliation_Method_for_Physical_Layer_Key_Generation","334421703_Lightweight_Group_Secret_Key_Generation_Leveraging_Non-Reconciled_Received_Signal_Strength_in_Mobile_Wireless_Networks","333866459_Physical_Layer_Key_Generation_in_5G_and_Beyond_Wireless_Communications_Challenges_and_Opportunities","328359309_Channel-Envelope_Differencing_Eliminates_Secret_Key_Correlation_LoRa-Based_Key_Generation_in_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks","328257176_Constructing_Reciprocal_Channel_Coefficients_for_Secret_Key_Generation_in_FDD_Systems","325497483_An_Investigation_of_Using_Loop-Back_Mechanism_for_Channel_Reciprocity_Enhancement_in_Secret_Key_Generation","323710498_High-Agreement_Uncorrelated_Secret_Key_Generation_Based_on_Principal_Component_Analysis_Preprocessing","313448946_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things_in_a_Quantum_World","311491860_On_the_insecurity_of_the_latest_generation_implantable_cardiac_defibrillators_and_how_to_secure_them","309083918_Experimental_Study_on_Key_Generation_for_Physical_Layer_Security_in_Wireless_Communications","292205529_Key_Generation_From_Wireless_Channels_A_Review","282551758_Encryption_for_Implantable_Medical_Devices_Using_Modified_One-Time_Pads","241630430_Collaborative_secret_key_extraction_leveraging_Received_Signal_Strength_in_mobile_wireless_networks","224243867_Fast_and_scalable_secret_key_generation_exploiting_channel_phase_randomness_in_wireless_networks","224106014_An_overview_of_the_IEEE_802154a_standard","220926764_Radio-telepathy_Extracting_a_secret_key_from_an_unauthenticated_wireless_channel","3078265_Common_randomness_in_information_theory_and_cryptography_I_Secret_sharing","331846062_Securing_M2M_Transmissions_Using_Nonreconciled_Secret_Keys_Generated_from_Wireless_Channels","313532021_Secret_Group_Key_Generation_in_Physical_Layer_for_Multi-Antenna_Mesh_Topology","304296278_Bringing_PHY-Based_Key_Generation_into_the_Field_An_Evaluation_for_Practical_Scenarios","301307138_Group_Secret_Key_Generation_in_Wireless_Networks_Algorithms_and_Rate_Optimization","273397135_Group_Secret_Key_Generation_via_Received_Signal_Strength_Protocols_Achievable_Rates_and_Implementation","260353741_Limitations_of_Generating_a_Secret_Key_Using_Wireless_Fading_Under_Active_Adversary","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","224592527_Decoder_complexity_for_BCH_codes","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","3078257_Secret_key_agreement_by_public_discussion","3018329_Wireless_secret_key_generation_exploiting_reactance-domain_scalar_response_of_multipath_fading_channels"]}
