{"id":"331906686_Generalized_Picture_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Their_Application_in_Decision_Support_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, a generalized picture fuzzy soft set is proposed, which is an extension of the picture fuzzy soft sets. We investigate the basic properties of picture fuzzy soft sets and define an F-subset, M-subset, extended union, extended intersection, restricted union, restricted intersection and also prove the De Morgan's laws for picture fuzzy soft information. We investigate upper and lower substitution for both picture fuzzy sets and generalized picture fuzzy soft sets. Meanwhile, the related proofs are given in detail. Finally, we propose an algorithm to deal with generalized picture fuzzy soft information. To show the supremacy and effectiveness of the proposed technique, we illustrate a descriptive example using generalized picture fuzzy soft information. Results indicate that the proposed technique is more generalized and effective over all the existing structures of fuzzy soft sets.
