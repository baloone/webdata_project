{"id":"325830172_A_novel_control_scheme_for_quadrotor_UAV_based_upon_active_disturbance_rejection_control","abstract":"A double closed-loop active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme is proposed to deal with some difficult control problems in the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system such as nonlinearity, strong coupling and sensitive to disturbance, etc. Firstly, the virtual control variables are introduced to decouple the quadrotor flight system that can simplify the mathematical model of the system. Secondly, the extended state observer (ESO) is used to estimate and compensate the internal uncertainties and external disturbances in real time which can improve the robustness and anti-disturbance ability of the system. Finally, the stability of the system is proved. The simulation results show that the control scheme proposed in this paper can ensure that the quadrotor track the target trajectory quickly and accurately while maintaining stability, even with external disturbances.","authors":["Yong Zhang","Zengqiang Chen","Xinghui Zhang","Qinglin Sun"],"meta":["June 2018Aerospace Science and Technology 79","DOI:10.1016/j.ast.2018.06.017"],"references":["308852905_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Trajectory_Tracking_Control_of_Quadrotor_VTOL_Aircraft_With_Elliptic_Membership_Functions"]}
