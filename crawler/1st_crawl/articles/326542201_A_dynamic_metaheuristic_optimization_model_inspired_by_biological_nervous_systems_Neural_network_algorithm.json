The proposed method, named as neural network algorithm (NNA), is developed based on the unique structure of ANNs. The NNA benefits from complicated structure of the ANNs and its operators in order to generate new candidate solutions. In terms of convergence proof, the relationship between improvised exploitation and each parameter under asymmetric interval is derived and an iterative convergence of NNA is proved theoretically. In this paper, the NNA with its interconnected computing unit is examined for 21 well-known unconstrained benchmarks with dimensions 50â€“200 for evaluating its performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms and recent optimization methods. Besides, several constrained engineering design problems have been investigated to validate the efficiency of NNA for searching in feasible region in constrained optimization problems. Being an algorithm without any effort for fine tuning initial parameters and statistically superior can distinguish the NNA over other reported optimizers. It can be concluded that, the ANNs and its particular structure can be successfully utilized and modeled as metaheuristic optimization method for handling optimization problems.","authors":["Ali Sadollah","Hassan Sayyaadi","Anupam Yadav"],"meta":["July 2018Applied Soft Computing 71","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2018.07.039","Project: Neural Network Algorithm"],"references":["291556019_A_cooperative_particle_swarm_optimizer_with_stochastic_movements_for_computationally_expensive_numerical_optimization_problems","317031594_Jaya_WCA_and_HS_algorithms_for_solving_large-scale_real-life_urban_traffic_light_scheduling_problem","314199207_A_novel_version_of_simulated_annealing_based_on_linguistic_patterns_for_solving_facility_layout_problems","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","313606073_A_discrete_binary_version_of_particle_swarm_algorithm","305631014_Optimizing_Urban_Traffic_Light_Scheduling_Problem_Using_Harmony_Search_with_Ensemble_of_Local_Search","304455084_Tournament-based_harmony_search_algorithm_for_non-convex_economic_load_dispatch_problem","297589069_Harmony_search_algorithm_for_image_reconstruction_from_projections","285856879_An_efficient_constraint_handling_method_for_genetic_algorithms","272355660_Applications_of_network_analysis_and_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_for_selecting_optimal_water_quality_sensor_locations_in_water_distribution_networks","271646935_Problem_definitions_and_evaluation_criteria_for_the_CEC_2014_special_session_and_competition_on_single_objective_real-parameter_numerical_optimization","275346413_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiments","263968528_Using_Animal_Instincts_to_Design_Efficient_Biomedical_Studies_via_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","257391447_Automated_Control_of_an_Actively_Compensated_Langmuir_Probe_System_Using_Simulated_Annealing"]}
