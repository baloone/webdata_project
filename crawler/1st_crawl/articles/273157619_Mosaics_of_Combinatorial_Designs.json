{"id":"273157619_Mosaics_of_Combinatorial_Designs","abstract":"Looking at incidence matrices of $t$-$(v,k,\\lambda)$ designs as $v \\times b$\nmatrices with $2$ possible entries, each of which indicates incidences of a\n$t$-design, we introduce the notion of a $c$-mosaic of designs, having the same\nnumber of points and blocks, as a matrix with $c$ different entries, such that\neach entry defines incidences of a design. In fact, a $v \\times b$ matrix is\ndecomposed in $c$ incidence matrices of designs, each denoted by a different\ncolour, hence this decomposition might be seen as a tiling of a matrix with\nincidence matrices of designs as well. These mosaics have applications in\nexperiment design when considering a simultaneous run of several different\nexperiments. We have constructed infinite series of examples of mosaics and\nstate some probably non-trivial open problems.","authors":["Oliver Wilhelm Gnilke","Marcus Greferath","Mario Pavcevic"],"meta":["January 2018Designs Codes and Cryptography 86(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-017-0328-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["286654027_Tiling_Groups_with_Difference_Sets","266919175_Nesting_Symmetric_Designs","236635083_Existence_of_q-Analogs_of_Steiner_Systems","228817634_Asynchronous_Multichannel_MAC_Design_With_Difference-Set-Based_Hopping_Sequences","286428399_Optimal_fractional_repetition_codes_for_distributed_storage_systems","257555047_Equations_for_coefficients_of_tactical_decomposition_matrices_for_t-designs","245335221_An_examination_of_the_different_possible_solutions_of_a_problem_in_incomplete_blocks","222732735_On_coloured_constant_composition_designs","222490316_Combinatorial_designs_with_Costas_arrays_properties"]}
