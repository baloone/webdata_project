{"id":"333095987_Improved_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_via_the_Bundle_Method","abstract":"Maximum margin clustering (MMC) is an effective clustering algorithm, which first extends large margin principle into unsupervised learning. This paper revisits the maximum margin clustering problem, and points out the potential problems encountered by a cutting plane approach. We propose an improved maximum margin clustering algorithm via the bundle method (BMMC). Specifically, the constrained convex-concave procedure algorithm is first applied to decompose the MMC problem into a series of convex sub-problems, and then the bundle method is adopted to efficiently solve each sub-problem. Moreover, a simpler formulation for multi-class MMC is presented. In addition to clustering problems, BMMC is also extended to the semi-supervised case by incorporating the pairwise constraints, which reveals its high scalability. Comparing with previous works, the proposed solution is much simpler and faster. Experiments on several data sets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","authors":["Jianqiang Li","Jingchao Sun","Lu Liu","Bo Liua"],"meta":["May 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916724"],"references":["323956678_Speaker_Clustering_With_Neural_Networks_And_Audio_Processing","321102781_Multiprocessor_architecture_for_real-time_applications_using_mean_shift_clustering","312038450_A_picture_fuzzy_clustering_approach_for_brain_tumor_segmentation","301819453_Temporal_Clustering_of_Time_Series_via_Threshold_Autoregressive_Models_Application_to_Commodity_Prices","284121466_Two-dimensional_discriminant_locality_preserving_projections_2DDLPP_and_its_application_to_feature_extraction_via_fuzzy_set","280882918_Metrics_for_evaluating_3D_medical_image_segmentation_Analysis_selection_and_tool","228636738_Kernel_methods_for_missing_variables","221618156_Computing_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_with_EM_Using_Equivalence_Constraints","221346088_Efficient_multiclass_maximum_margin_clustering","220907165_Efficient_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_via_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm","220499972_The_Concave-Convex_Procedure","327813749_A_Novel_Objective_Function_Based_Clustering_with_Optimal_Number_of_Clusters","321403603_A_deep_learning_architecture_for_brain_tumor_segmentation_in_MRI_images","320384354_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_of_Normal_and_Pathological_Tissues_Using_K-mean_Clustering_with_Fuzzy_C-mean_Clustering","320116935_Analyzing_Game_Stickiness_Using_Clustering_Techniques","309456686_Brain_tumor_segmentation_with_deep_neural_networks","307593370_Based_on_Rough_Set_and_Fuzzy_Clustering_of_MRI_Brain_Segmentation","303917123_Local_graph_embedding_based_on_maximum_margin_criterion_via_Fuzzy_Set","303693405_Fuzzy_clustering_of_probability_density_functions","300431280_A_Parametric_Active_Set_method_for_QP_solution","286223578_Maximum_Volume_Clustering_A_New_Discriminative_Clustering_Approach","276307497_Incremental_maximum_margin_clustering","273754057_Multiclass_maximum_margin_clustering_via_immune_evolutionary_algorithm_for_automatic_diagnosis_of_electrocardiogram_arrhythmias","268859200_Estimation_of_dependences_based_on_empirical_data_Translated_from_the_Russian_by_Samuel_Kotz_With_a_new_afterword_of_the_2006_ed_Empirical_inference_science_2nd_ed_reprint_of_1982_ed","262147058_Feature_extraction_using_two-dimensional_maximum_embedding_difference","256721322_Soft_large_margin_clustering","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","230873058_The_Cutting-Plane_Method_for_Solving_Convex_Programs","224223966_Semi-Supervised_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_with_Pairwise_Constraints","221618897_Maximum_Margin_Clustering","221617647_Bundle_Methods_for_Machine_Learning","221603974_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Multi-Class_Support_Vector_Machines","221345243_Integrating_Constraints_and_Metric_Learning_in_Semi-Supervised_Clustering","220320252_Dissimilarity_in_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Classification","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","46585922_On_the_Doubt_about_Margin_Explanation_of_Boosting","7211793_A_Discriminative_Learning_Framework_with_Pairwise_Constraints_for_Video_Object_Classification"]}
