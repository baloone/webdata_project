{"id":"327118133_COMPUTACIONAL_SIMULATION_IN_CAPACITANCE_EDUCATION_FOR_GRADUATION_COURSES","abstract":"This work proposes a didactic sequence on capacitor teaching, available in the Interactive Simulations of the\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder (PhET), organized in the form of two scripts, called practice A (Parallel plate\ncapacitor) and practice B (Capacitor association). The work was applied to students of the Licentiate in Physics of the\nFederal University of Acre, in the discipline of General Physics Laboratory III, in two classes of 100 minutes in\nComputer science laboratory. The scripts contained the theory needed to understand the subject, procedural\nguidelines, and questions that explored content. Throughout the development of activities, the students called the\nteacher to clarify doubts. At the end, the students showed the issues resolved and the teacher pointed out corrections\nwhenever necessary. The students were interested in the work and had a good learning, due to the orientation\nreceived and the few mistakes seen by the teacher.","authors":["Israel Her√¥ncio Rodrigues de Oliveira Hadad","Eloi Junior","Marcelo Castanheira Da Silva"],"meta":["August 2018"],"references":["326901416_ENSINO_DOS_PROCESSOS_DE_ELETRIZACAO_NO_3_ANO_DO_ENSINO_MEDIO_USANDO_AS_TEORIAS_COGNITIVISTAS_DE_VYGOTSKY_E_DE_AUSUBEL_ALIADAS_A_ATIVIDADES_EXPERIMENTAIS_TEACHING_OF_THE_PROCESSES_OF_ELECTRIFICATION_IN","322636604_O_USO_DO_GNUPLOT_COMO_FERRAMENTA_PARA_O_ENSINO_DE_FISICA","318726524_Construcao_de_um_Gerador_de_Ondas_de_Baixo_Custo_e_Possiveis_Abordagens_no_Ensino_de_Fisica"]}
