{"id":"265943337_On_the_Number_of_2-Protected_Nodes_in_Tries_and_Suffix_Trees","abstract":"International audience\nWe use probabilistic and combinatorial tools on strings to discover the average number of 2-protected nodes in tries and in suffix trees. Our analysis covers both the uniform and non-uniform cases. For instance, in a uniform trie with $n$ leaves, the number of 2-protected nodes is approximately 0.803$n$, plus small first-order fluctuations. The 2-protected nodes are an emerging way to distinguish the interior of a tree from the fringe.","authors":["Jeffrey Gaither","Yushi Homma","Mark Sellke","Mark Daniel Ward"],"meta":["January 2012Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS DMTCS Proceedings vol.
