{"id":"344737671_A_Discrete-Event_Simulation_of_Claude_Levi-Strauss'_Structural_Analysis_of_Myths_Based_on_Symmetry_and_Double_Twist_Transformations","abstract":"This paper presents a modeling and simulation approach in order to perform a generative analysis of folktales aimed at validating Claude Lévi-Strauss’ theory and method. To this aim, a discrete-event simulation is proposed. The simulation is based on the development of a set of discrete-event models dedicated to generating a set of folktales from an initial one, according to Claude Lévi-Strauss’ structural analysis based on symmetry and double twist transformations. This paper describes in detail how these discrete-event models have been implemented in the framework of the DEVSimPy software environment by using myths of Native American mythology and folktales of Corsican oral literature. The validation involved the following steps: (i) definition of a reference folktale (according to Claude Lévi-Strauss’ methodology) (ii) generation of a set of folktales by performing their own transformations (iii) generation of a graph allowing to analyze the links that have been created after performing a set of folktales transformations. Finally, the computational validation of Lévi-Strauss’s method is intended to ground a new research that may reformulate structural analysis and elaborate a neo-structural model of canonical formalization based on transformational morphodynamics. The aim is to conceptualize and measure recursively the structural dynamics and the recurrent patterns of current identity transformations in liberal democracies, especially in US and EU contexts where ethnic/racial divisions and migration challenges are becoming more acute than ever.","authors":["Jean-François Santucci","Albert Doja","Laurent Capocchi"],"meta":["October 2020Symmetry 12(10):1706","DOI:10.3390/sym12101706","Project: Special Issue on “Anthropology and Ontological Symmetry” (https://www.mdpi.com/si/41911)."],"references":["346055752_Celebrations_of_Levi-Strauss's_Heroic_Legacy","344726637_Levi-Strauss's_heroic_anthropology_facing_contemporary_problems_of_the_modern_world","329935661_Zeigler_B_P_Muzy_A_Kofman_E_2018_Theory_of_Modeling_and_Simulation_Discrete_Event_Iterative_System_Computational_Foundations_Academic_Press","329043494_A_post-structuralist_revised_Weil-Levi-Strauss_transformation_formula_for_conceptual_value-fields","328923440_Politics_of_mass_rapes_in_ethnic_conflict_a_morphodynamics_of_raw_madness_and_cooked_evil","322753211_Social_Morphodynamics_Mapping_Identity_Transformations_Cultural_Encounters_and_the_Evolution_of_Core_Values","334725850_Levi-Strauss_Two_lives","333953485_The_Inauthenticity_of_Anthropology_The_Myth_of_Structuralism","332087361_The_Algebraic_Mind_Integrating_Connectionism_and_Cognitive_Science","331300566_The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World_On_the_Possibility_of_Life_in_Capitalist_Ruins"]}
