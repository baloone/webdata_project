{"id":"348982636_Intelligent_driving_intelligence_test_for_autonomous_vehicles_with_naturalistic_and_adversarial_environment","abstract":"Driving intelligence tests are critical to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The prevailing approach tests autonomous vehicles in life-like simulations of the naturalistic driving environment. However, due to the high dimensionality of the environment and the rareness of safety-critical events, hundreds of millions of miles would be required to demonstrate the safety performance of autonomous vehicles, which is severely inefficient. We discover that sparse but adversarial adjustments to the naturalistic driving environment, resulting in the naturalistic and adversarial driving environment, can significantly reduce the required test miles without loss of evaluation unbiasedness. By training the background vehicles to learn when to execute what adversarial maneuver, the proposed environment becomes an intelligent environment for driving intelligence testing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed environment in a highway-driving simulation. Comparing with the naturalistic driving environment, the proposed environment can accelerate the evaluation process by multiple orders of magnitude.","authors":["Shuo Feng","Xintao Yan","Haowei Sun","Yiheng Feng"],"meta":["February 2021Nature Communications 12(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-21007-8","Project: Testing and Evaluation of Highly Automated Driving Systems"],"references":["340972197_How_to_Safeguard_AI","337264008_A_survey_of_deep_learning_techniques_for_autonomous_driving","332047700_AADS_Augmented_autonomous_driving_simulation_using_data-driven_algorithms","344442073_Testing_Scenario_Library_Generation_for_Connected_and_Automated_Vehicles_An_Adaptive_Framework","342863653_Safety_assessment_of_highly_automated_driving_systems_in_test_tracks_A_new_framework","342329881_Identification_of_Lane-Change_Maneuvers_in_Real-World_Drivings_With_Hidden_Markov_Model_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","341137830_Testing_Scenario_Library_Generation_for_Connected_and_Automated_Vehicles_Part_II_Case_Studies","339248762_Testing_Scenario_Library_Generation_for_Connected_and_Automated_Vehicles_Part_I_Methodology","332053982_Autonomous_vehicles_An_imperfect_path_to_saving_millions_of_lives","332053905_Parallel_testing_of_vehicle_intelligence_via_virtual-real_interaction"]}
