{"id":"309704138_Nutrition_knowledge_of_young_post-year_one_non-biological_science_female_students_at_a_private_university_in_Rivers_State_Nigeria","abstract":"Background: Nutrition knowledge, highly associated with healthy eating is especially needed by women of child-bearing age. High knowledge is expected of female university students but, in non-biosciences this may not hold because of inadequate study of life sciences.\nObjective: To assess nutrition knowledge and effects of age, course of study and birth order of second to final year students of Madonna University Elele, in non-biological science disciplines.\nMethodology: Data were collected from engineering and computer science students using semi-structured questionnaire. Analysis was by frequency, percentage and SPSS version 20 statistical soft-ware.\nResults: Students generally had fair nutrition knowledge (59.7%). Further, 10.1% of engineering and 3.2% of computer science students had very good knowledge. Students who were their families’ only daughters\nhad the highest knowledge (9.1% had very good knowledge) followed by 1st daughters (7.1% had very good knowledge). Daughters who were the last offsprings had the least knowledge (1.6% had very good knowledge). Effect of age could not be determined due to low number between 25–29 years age group.\nConclusions: Course of study impacted on nutrition knowledge. Careers in non-bioscience disciplines did not favour adequate nutrition knowledge. However, chemistry as an essential component of such courses could mitigate the knowledge deficiency. Birth order that exposed a child to household responsibilities favoured nutrition knowledge.","authors":["Emmanuel C ENEMCHUKWU","Samson Agbaje"],"meta":["September 2016Psychologia: an international journal of psychology in the Orient 28(3-4):94-99"],"references":["268449862_Micronutrient_Status_in_Female_University_Students_Iron_Zinc_Copper_Selenium_Vitamin_B12_and_Folate","265912800_Iodine_nutrition_and_thyroid_function_assessment_in_childbearing_age_women_from_Queretaro_Mexico","230895921_Accuracy_of_Various_Iron_Parameters_in_the_Prediction_of_Iron_Deficiency_Anemia_among_Healthy_Women_of_Child_Bearing_Age_Saudi_Arabia","51444995_Dietary_taurine_intake_nutrients_intake_dietary_habits_and_life_stress_by_depression_in_Korean_female_college_students_A_case-control_study","47369166_Nutritional_iron_deficiency_in_women_of_child_bearing_age--what_to_do","45268200_Social_Determinants_of_Protein-Energy_Malnutrition_Need_to_Attack_the_Causes_of_the_Causes","314877764_Nutrition_for_wound_healing","297506449_Nutrition_and_the_risk_of_stroke_vol_11_pg_66_2012","230638452_Nutrition_for_wound_healing","51882625_Nutrition_and_the_risk_of_stroke","8221345_Nutrition_and_cancer_A_review_of_the_evidence_for_an_anti-cancer_diet","44800601_Stunting_and_micronutrient_deficiencies_in_malnourished_children","12963396_Development_of_a_General_Nutrition_Knowledge_Questionnaire_for_Adults","12431423_Nutrition_knowledge_and_Food_Intake","7802502_Mechanisms_of_Nutrient_Modulation_of_the_Immune_Response"]}
