{"id":"275971165_'My_children_tell_me_it's_so_simple'_A_mixed-methods_approach_to_understand_older_non-users'_perceptions_of_Social_Networking_Sites","abstract":"While there has been a great deal of research on younger people using Social Networking Sites (SNSs), there has been less work on older people and non-users. We present a mixed-methods design with a technology-acceptance survey and focus-group interviews to study older Norwegian non-usersâ€™ perceptions of SNSs. Our study reveals that most non-users in our sample deliberately do not use SNSs. They perceive SNS communication as cold and narcissistic and view the usefulness of SNSs to be low. This finding indicates a generational culture gap in how young versus older people experience SNSs. Privacy and security concerns are also prevalent. Non-users, expressing an interest in SNSs, believe SNSs could increase contact with family and friends, but perceive lack of competence to be a barrier.","authors":["Petter Bae Brandtzaeg"],"meta":["November 2014New Media & Society","DOI:10.1177/1461444814554064"],"references":["324222556_Designing_Social_Networking_Sites_for_Older_Adults","281164714_Life-Based_Design_Against_Loneliness_Among_Older_People","279936062_Social_Networking_Sites_Their_Users_and_Social_Implications_-_A_Longitudinal_Study","263589932_Reviewing_the_definition_of_elderly","263568314_The_Impact_of_Context_Collapse_and_Privacy_on_Social_Network_Site_Disclosures","336571342_Designing_for_Elders_Exploring_the_Complexity_of_Relationships_in_Later_Life","336569280_A_Little_Silly_and_Empty-Headed_-_Older_Adults'_Understandings_of_Social_Networking_Sites","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","285538622_Bridging_the_Qualitative-Quantitative_Divide_Guidelines_for_Conducting_Mixed_Methods_Research_in_Information_Systems","267922562_The_Diffusion_of_Innovations"]}
