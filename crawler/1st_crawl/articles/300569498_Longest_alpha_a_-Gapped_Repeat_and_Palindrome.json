{"id":"300569498_Longest_alpha_a_-Gapped_Repeat_and_Palindrome","abstract":"We propose an efficient algorithm finding, for a word w and an integer \\(\\alpha >0\\), the longest word u such that w has a factor uvu, with \\(|uv|\\le \\alpha |u|\\) (i.e., the longest \\(\\alpha \\)-gapped repeat of w). Our algorithm runs in \\({\\mathcal O}(\\alpha n)\\) time. Moreover, it can be easily adapted to find the longest u such that w has a factor \\(u^Rvu\\), with \\(|uv|\\le \\alpha |u|\\) (i.e., the longest \\(\\alpha \\)-gapped palindrome), again in \\({\\mathcal O}(\\alpha n)\\) time.","authors":["Pawel Gawrychowski","Florin Manea"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22177-9_3","Conference: International Symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory"],"references":["256606518_Searching_of_Gapped_Repeats_and_Subrepetitions_in_a_Word","221513049_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Two_Extensions_of_LPF_Table_The_Power_of_Suffix_Arrays","221314014_Finding_Maximal_Pairs_With_Bounded_Gap","220113559_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Repetitions_in_a_Word","262805753_A_new_characterization_of_maximal_repetitions_by_Lyndon_trees","257907962_Efficient_Data_Structures_for_the_Factor_Periodicity_Problem","220555899_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences_Computer_Science_and_Computational_Biology","220432469_A_New_Linear-Time_On-Line''_Algorithm_for_Finding_the_Smallest_Initial_Palindrome_of_a_String","220430943_Linear_work_suffix_array_construction","220154252_Usefulness_of_the_Karp-Miller-Rosenberg_Algorithm_in_Parallel_Computations_on_Strings_and_Arrays","220153395_Searching_for_gapped_palindromes","220115920_Computing_Longest_Previous_non-overlapping_Factors","51888616_Pattern_Matching_in_Lempel-Ziv_Compressed_Strings_Fast_Simple_and_Deterministic","3832192_Finding_Maximal_Repetitions_in_a_Word_in_Linear_Time","2400590_Finding_Repeats_With_Fixed_Gap"]}
