{"id":"233071161_Web_Subject_Guides_Virtual_Connections_across_the_University_Community","abstract":"A year ago, West Chester University Libraries began using the LibGuides library content management system. In the 1st year since implementing LibGuides (http://subjectguides.wcupa.edu/), our subject librarians have developed numerous subject guides, replacing outmoded and outdated Web pages with new guides that have a more appealing format. We have also found that Web guides can be used for projects beyond the traditional library subject guide. One of the best features of the LibGuides software is that it allows our subject librarians to easily repackage information and resources in multiple ways that suit different audiences. In this article, the authors describe how they have used these guides to respond to the needs of their university community and how they hope to expand the potential uses of the Web guides.","authors":["Rachel McMullin","Jane Hutton"],"meta":["October 2010Journal of Library Administration 50(7):789-797","DOI:10.1080/01930826.2010.488972"],"references":["48459012_Academic_Subject_Guides_A_Case_Study_of_Use_at_San_Jose_State_University","48306489_Students_Librarians_and_Subject_Guides_Improving_a_Poor_Rate_of_Return","47752496_LibGuides_and_Librarians_Connecting_Content_and_Community","26189439_LibGuides"]}
