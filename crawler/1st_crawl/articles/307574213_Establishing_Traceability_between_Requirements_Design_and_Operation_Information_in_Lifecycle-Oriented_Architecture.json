{"id":"307574213_Establishing_Traceability_between_Requirements_Design_and_Operation_Information_in_Lifecycle-Oriented_Architecture","abstract":"Many uncertainties arise in system development as systems can be complex and large-scale and can be deployed in an uncertain environment. Developers cannot determine some types of uncertainties until the start of an operation. To deal with changing requirements and environments owing to these uncertainties, we must build an architecture that takes operations into account within a system development lifecycle. In this paper, a lifecycle-oriented development process is proposed to improve the uncertainties of requirement and design. As a case study, we apply the proposed method to the development of Patrash, a transfer guide application.","authors":["Shota Ishibashi","Kenji Hisazumi","Tsuneo Nakanishi","Akira Fukuda"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.172","Conference: 2016 5th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)"],"references":["228990118_The_goal_structuring_notation-a_safety_argument_notation"]}
