{"id":"220183320_A_Method_for_Registration_of_3-D_Shapes","abstract":"This paper describes a general purpose, representation independent\nmethod for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of\n3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles\nthe full six-degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest\npoint (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the\nclosest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm\nalways converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a\nmean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of\nconvergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given\nan adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular\nclass of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can\nglobally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees\nof freedom by testing each initial registration. For examples, a given\n'model' shape and a sensed 'data' shape that represents a major portion\nof the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial\ntranslation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the\ngiven level of model complexity. One important application of this\nmethod is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an\nideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is\nalso useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence\n(shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as\nfor estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences\nare not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the\nregistration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.","authors":["Paul Besl","Neil D.
