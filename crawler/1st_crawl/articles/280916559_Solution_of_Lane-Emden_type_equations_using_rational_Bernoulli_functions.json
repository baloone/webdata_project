{"id":"280916559_Solution_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_rational_Bernoulli_functions","abstract":"In this paper, a numerical method for solving Lane-Emden type equations, which are nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the semi-infinite domain, is presented. The method is based upon the modified rational Bernoulli functions; these functions are first introduced. Operational matrices of derivative and product of modified rational Bernoulli functions are then given and are utilized to reduce the solution of the Lane-Emden type equations to a system of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique.
