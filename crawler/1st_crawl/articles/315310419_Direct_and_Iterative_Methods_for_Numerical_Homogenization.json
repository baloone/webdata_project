{"id":"315310419_Direct_and_Iterative_Methods_for_Numerical_Homogenization","abstract":"Elliptic problems with oscillating coefficients can be approximated up to arbitrary accuracy by using sufficiently fine meshes, i.e., by resolving the fine scale. Well-known multiscale finite elements (Henning et al. ESAIM: Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 48:1331–1349, 2014; Målqvist and Peterseim, Math. Comput. 83:2583–2603, 2014) can be regarded as direct numerical homogenization methods in the sense that they provide approximations of the corresponding (unfeasibly) large linear systems by much smaller systems while preserving the fine-grid discretization accuracy (model reduction). As an alternative, we present iterative numerical homogenization methods that provide approximations up to fine-grid discretization accuracy and discuss differences and commonalities.","authors":["Ralf Kornhuber","Joscha Podlesny","Harry Yserentant"],"meta":["March 2017Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-52389-7_21","In book: Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering XXIII (pp.217-225)"],"references":["233409464_A_localized_orthogonal_decomposition_method_for_semi-linear_elliptic_problems","231744276_The_heterogeneous_multiscale_method","220577199_Convergence_of_multi-scale_finite_element_method_for_elliptic_problems_with_rapidly_oscillating_coefficients","309062961_Numerical_Homogenization_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems_by_Subspace_Decomposition","283399264_A_Priori_and_a_Posteriori_Error_Analysis_for_Numerical_Homogenization_A_Unified_Framework","265367755_Approximation_by_finite_element_functions_using_local_regularization","230649914_Iterative_Methods_by_Space_Decomposition_and_Subspace_Correction","223044817_The_variational_multiscale_method_-_A_paradigm_for_computational_mechanics","51947891_Localization_of_Elliptic_Multiscale_Problems","2336341_Old_and_New_Convergence_Proofs_for_Multigrid_Methods","2268036_Resonance_Error_In_Multiscale_Finite_Element_Methods"]}
