{"id":"321985430_Student_teachers'_satisfaction_for_blended_learning_via_Edmodo_learning_management_system","abstract":"In a digitally driven world, behaviours of future teachers for blended learning (both face-to-face and on-line classes) need to be examined. This study serves three purposes. The first is to examine student teachers’ preferences for Community-of-Inquiry model-driven blended learning via Edmodo. Second, predicting student satisfaction on b-learning from a combination of four variables (gender, having internet access, using the internet for information access, and previous experience in on-line learning) was questioned. And third, b-learning orientations of participants were investigated. One of the mixed methods, the concurrent triangulation design was employed in which both qualitative and quantitative methods were applied. The study group included 135 freshmen and junior students (29 males and 106 females) from a western Turkish educational faculty. The findings for the first question indicated that 70.4% of student teachers prefer b-learning. For the second, 15% of the variance in satisfaction on b-learning was explained by the proposed model with a medium effect. And for the third, the qualitative findings were discussed under Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Uselessness and Unease-of-Use (PU-UU) themes. Although less than a quarter of participants found b-learning useless, most held positive notions for b-learning practices via Edmodo.","authors":["Alev Ateş Çobanoğlu"],"meta":["December
