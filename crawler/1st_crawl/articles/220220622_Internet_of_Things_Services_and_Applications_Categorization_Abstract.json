{"id":"220220622_Internet_of_Things_Services_and_Applications_Categorization_Abstract","abstract":"In this paper we attempt to categorize the services provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to help application developers build upon a base service. First we introduce the four main categories of services, and then follow by providing a number of examples of each of the service categories so as to provide an example of how each type of service might be implemented, and how it can be used to build an IoT application.
