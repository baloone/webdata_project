{"id":"295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","abstract":"In many practical applications with a graph structure, there may exist crossing between edges which is not allowed in a crisp planar graph. Considering that graphic structures can be used to describe the crossing of\nedges in an m-polar fuzzy multi-graph with certain amount of m-polar fuzzy planarity value, first of all the notion of m-polar fuzzy multi-set is introduced. Then m-polar fuzzy multi-graphs, m-polar fuzzy planar graphs and m-polar fuzzy strong edges are defined. Several properties of m-polar fuzzy planar graphs are also studied.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["February 2016International Journal of Computing Science and Mathematics 7(3):283-292","DOI:10.1504/IJCSM.2016.077854","Project: Fuzzy graph"],"references":["283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","283005097_On_some_operations_and_density_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
