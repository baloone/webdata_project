{"id":"299044874_Pulse_Oximetry_Plethysmographic_Waveform_During_Changes_in_Blood_Volume","abstract":"Systolic pressure variation (SPV) and its dDown component have been shown to be sensitive factors in estimating intravascular volume in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. In this study, ventilation-induced changes in pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform were evaluated after removal and after reinfusion of 10% estimated blood volume. The plethysmographic waveform variation (SPVplet) was measured as the difference between maximal and minimal peaks of waveform during the ventilatory cycle, and expressed as a percentage of the signal amplitude during apnoea. dUP(plet) and dDown(plet) were measured as the distance between the apnoeic plateau and the maximal or minimal plethysmographic systolic waveform, respectively. Intravascular volume was changed by removal of 10% of estimated blood volume and followed by equal volume replacement with Haemaccel. A 10% decrease in blood volume increased SPVplet from mean 17.0 (SD 11.8)% to 31.6 (28.0)% (P=0.005) and dDown(plet) from 8.7 (5.1)% to 20.5 (12.9)% (P=0.0005) compared with baseline. Changes in plethysmographic waveform correlated with changes in arterial SPV and dDown (r=0.85; P=0.0009). In the absence of invasive arterial pressure monitoring, ventilation-induced waveform variability of the plethysmographic signal measured from pulse oximetry is a useful tool in the detection of mild hypovolaemia.","authors":["Merav Shamir","Leonid A Eidelman","Yizhar Floman","Leon Kaplan"],"meta":["February 1999BJA British Journal of Anaesthesia 82(2):178-181","DOI:10.1097/00132586-199912000-00061"],"references":["239293888_Photoelectric_plethysmography-Some_fundamental_aspects_of_the_reflection_and_transmission_method","22667232_The_nature_and_incidence_of_complications_of_peripheral_arterial_puncture","20808746_The_use_of_systolic_pressure_variation_in_hemodynamic_monitoring_during_deliberate_hypotension_in_spine_surgery","19845055_Systolic_Blood_Pressure_Variation_is_a_Sensitive_Indicator_of_Hypovolemia_in_Ventilated_Dogs_Subjected_to_Graded_Hemorrhage","19166829_Photo-electric_plethysmography_as_a_monitoring_device_in_anaesthesia_Application_and_interpretation","18468457_Complications_of_Percutaneous_Radial-artery_Cannulation_An_Objective_Prospective_Study_in_Man","16844463_A_re-evaluation_of_the_hemodynamic_consequences_of_intermittent_positive_pressure_ventilation","15952160_The_Effect_of_Method_of_Radial_Artery_Cannulation_on_Postcannulation_Blood_Flow_and_Thrombus_Formation","15662140_The_Effect_of_Graded_Hemorrhage_and_Intravascular_Volume_Replacement_on_Systolic_Pressure_Variation_in_Humans_During_Mecanical_and_Spontaneous_Ventilation","15397473_Feldman_JM_Roth_JV_Bjoraker_DG_Maximum_blood_savings_by_acute_normovolemic_hemodilution"]}
