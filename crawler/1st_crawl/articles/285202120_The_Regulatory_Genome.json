{"id":"285202120_The_Regulatory_Genome","abstract":"Gene regulatory networks are the most complex, extensive control systems found in nature. The interaction between biology and evolution has been the subject of great interest in recent years. This book beautifully explains animal evolution in terms of gene regulatory networks and includes 42 full-color descriptive figures. An authoritative and easy to read volume, presenting the biological processes during development (and their regulation) within the framework of evolution. This book is written to explain the idea of gene regulation without the reader needing to have a strong background in developmental biology. Eric Davidson has been instrumental in elucidating this relationship and he is a recognized expert in the field of developmental biology. This unique text supersedes anything currently available in the market. Â© 2006 Eric H. Davidson. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","authors":["E.
