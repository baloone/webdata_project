{"id":"325537757_Information_and_Causality_Mathematical_Reflections_on_Cancer_Biology_1","abstract":"Theorizing and measuring radically change in physics when using discrete vs. continuous mathematical spaces. We first recall that, in the 20 th century, discrete structures were brought into the limelight by Quantum and Information Theories. In these theories, the reference to discrete observables and parameters and to digital information is far from neutral in knowledge construction; it leads to dramatic consequences when biological dynamics are identified with information processing. Following an early debate in physics, we briefly analyze the origin and the nature of the bias thus induced in life sciences. We show how strong consequences have been derived from vague, common sense hypotheses and then stress their role in cancer biology. Finally, we summarize new theoretical frames that propose different directions as for the organizing principles for biological thinking and experimenting, including in cancer research. Cancer is then viewed as an organismal, tissue-based issue, according to the perspective proposed in (Sonnenschein & Soto, 1999; Baker, 2015).","authors":["Giuseppe Longo"],"meta":["June 2018","Project: Theoretical Principles for Biology"],"references":["318170825_How_Future_Depends_on_Past_and_Rare_Events_in_Systems_of_Life","318082084_Is_the_Genetic_Paradigm_of_Cancer_Complete","314750737_Intervening_in_a_continuous_world_when_Achilles_meets_his_tortoise","312069241_Single-Cell-Based_Analysis_Highlights_a_Surge_in_Cell-to-Cell_Molecular_Variability_Preceding_Irreversible_Commitment_in_a_Differentiation_Process","333259511_Differential_heterogenesis_and_the_emergence_of_semiotic_function","329081532_Eternal_Family_Trees_and_dynamics_on_unimodular_random_graphs","316925743_Point-map-probabilities_of_a_point_process_and_Mecke's_invariant_measure_equation","314501108_Reflections_on_Concrete_Incompleteness","312899033_Le_modele_linguistique_en_biologie","309622504_Preface_to_From_the_century_of_the_genome_to_the_century_of_the_organism_New_theoretical_approaches","305919513_Toward_a_theory_of_organisms_Three_founding_principles_in_search_of_a_useful_integration","305888475_Carcinogenesis_explained_within_the_context_of_a_theory_of_organisms","304780440_The_biological_default_state_of_cell_proliferation_with_variation_and_motility_a_fundamental_principle_for_a_theory_of_organisms","309606689_A_review-essay_on_reductionism_some_reasons_for_reading_Reductionism_Emergence_and_Levels_of_Reality_The_Importance_of_Being_Borderline","304822037_Why_do_we_need_theories"]}
