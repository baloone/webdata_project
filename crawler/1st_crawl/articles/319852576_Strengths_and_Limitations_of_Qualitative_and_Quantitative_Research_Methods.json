{"id":"319852576_Strengths_and_Limitations_of_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_Methods","abstract":"Scientific research adopts qualitative and quantitative methodologies in the modeling and analysis of numerous phenomena. The qualitative methodology intends to understand a complex reality and the meaning of actions in a given context. On the other hand, the quantitative methodology seeks to obtain accurate and reliable measurements that allow a statistical analysis. Both methodologies offer a set of methods, potentialities and limitations that must be explored and known by researchers. This paper concisely maps a total of seven qualitative methods and five quantitative methods. A comparative analysis of the most relevant and adopted methods is done to understand the main strengths and limitations of them. Additionally, the work developed intends to be a fundamental reference for the accomplishment of a research study, in which the researcher intends to adopt a qualitative or quantitative methodology. Through the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, it becomes possible to formulate a more accurate, informed and complete choice.","authors":["Fernando Almeida","Daniel Faria","André Queirós"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.887089","Project: Innovation and Entrepreneurship"],"references":["320353627_Qualitative_research_design_An_interactive_approach","309889936_The_Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Using_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Approaches_and_Methods_in_Language_Testing_and_Assessment_Research_A_Literature_Review","304339244_Comparison_of_Convenience_Sampling_and_Purposive_Sampling","287218361_Using_Interpretive_Qualitative_Case_Studies_for_Exploratory_Research_in_Doctoral_Studies_A_Case_of_Information_Systems_Research_in_Small_and_Medium_Enterprises","269869369_Interviewing_as_a_Data_Collection_Method_A_Critical_Review","313230325_Approaches_and_Principles_for_UX_Web_Experiences_A_Case_Study_Approach","303620890_Issues_of_validity_and_reliability_in_qualitative_research","272495170_Research_Methodology_Methods_Techniques","269752866_The_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_of_Research_Methodology_Comparison_and_Complimentary_between_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Approaches","268031548_Qualitative_Methods_Overview"]}
