{"id":"275245812_Feasibility_Studies_in_the_Product_Development_Process","abstract":"The term “feasibility study” is often used in context of product development processes. Feasibility studies focus on five subjects: technical, economic, legal, operational and scheduling feasibility studies. The best known field is the economic one. While in economy science there is a standard-proceeding of a “feasibility study”, in a technical context the term is used in different ways as shown by various research work. Thus, this paper aims to point out the relation of technical feasibility studies (TFS) and product development in context of the integrated product de- velopment model (iPeM).","authors":["Katharina Bause","Aline Radimersky","Marinette Iwanicki","Albert Albers"],"meta":["May 2014Procedia CIRP 21:473-478","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2014.03.128"],"references":["330926580_Five_hypotheses_about_engineering_processes_and_their_consequences","264835004_A_generalised_framework_to_compass_and_to_support_complex_product_engineering_processes","237635452_Effective_Mining_Project_Management_Systems","228432468_The_Use_and_Abuse_of_Feasibility_Studies"]}
