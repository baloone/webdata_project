{"id":"281050667_A_Fuzzy_Clustering-Based_Credibility_Model_for_Trust_Assessment_in_a_Service-Oriented_Architecture","abstract":"This paper presents a credibility model to assess trust of Web services. The model relies on consumers' ratings whose accuracy can be questioned due to different biases. A category of consumers known as strict are usually excluded from the process of reaching a majority consensus. We demonstrated that this exclusion should not be. The proposed model reduces the gap between these consumers' ratings and the current majority rating. Fuzzy clustering is used to compute consumers' credibility. To validate this model a set of experiments are carried out.","authors":["Zohra Saoud","Noura Faci","Zakaria Maamar","Djamal Benslimane"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/WETICE.2014.35"],"references":["233932672_Pattern_Recognition_With_Fuzzy_Objective_Function_Algorithms","221023836_A_trust_management_framework_for_service-oriented_environments","221023808_QoS_Computation_and_Policing_in_Dynamic_Web_Service_Selection","220895952_Specifying_and_Analysing_Trust_for_Internet_Applications","220473549_RATEWeb_Reputation_Assessment_for_Trust_Establishment_among_Web_services","4324157_Consensus_Clusterings","4092936_A_Reputation-based_trust_management_system_for_P2P_networks","4019865_A_reputation-based_trust_model_for_peer-to-peer_eCommerce_communities","3297318_PeerTrust_Supporting_Reputation-Based_Trust_for_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Communities","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","262394635_Cloud_Armor_a_platform_for_credibility-based_trust_management_of_cloud_services","249998627_A_Trust_Management_Model_for_QoS-Based_Service_Selection","240956486_Participatory_learning_A_paradigm_for_building_better_digital_and_human_agents","232627133_An_Efficient_K-Means_Clustering_Algorithm_Analysis_and_Implementation","228313259_Assessing_the_Competence_and_Credibility_of_Human_Sources_of_Intelligence_Evidence_Contributions_from_Law_and_Probability","225112838_Developing_an_Integrated_Trust_and_Reputation_Model_for_Open_Multi-Agent_Systems","224716234_A_Multi-Broker_Trust_Management_Framework_for_Resource_Selection_in_Grid","222825579_An_weighted_ontology-based_semantic_similarity_algorithm_for_web_service","220855299_Protecting_Online_Rating_Systems_from_Unfair_Ratings","220775129_MTrust-S_A_Multi-model_Based_Prototype_System_of_Trust_Management_for_Web_Services","43457883_Filtering_Out_Unfair_Ratings_in_Bayesian_Reputation_Systems"]}
