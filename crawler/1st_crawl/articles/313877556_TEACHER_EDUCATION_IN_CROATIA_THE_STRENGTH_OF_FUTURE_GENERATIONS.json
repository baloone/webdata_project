{"id":"313877556_TEACHER_EDUCATION_IN_CROATIA_THE_STRENGTH_OF_FUTURE_GENERATIONS","abstract":"The third millennium society is very different from that which today's educational system is intended\nfor. Great cultural and social changes taking place in recent decades are changing the very idea of education. To adapt the education system to the demands of today's society and direct it to the future as a factor of excellence and innovation, requires fundamental reforms at all levels of education, especially in teacher education. In fact, their role is irreplaceable in stimulating learning experiences of young people and adults and are key factors in the development of educational systems and reforms.\nIt is important for teacher education to develop the ability to adapt declarative and procedural knowledge and\nstructures of thinking to new circumstances which implies openness to change, autonomy in seeking solutions to educational work, the ability to engage in research and understanding its own professional development in the context of lifelong learning, so the authors of the work present a historical review of teacher education in\nCroatia from the second half of the 18th century to the present in order to consider the changes made and to set the research question: How do we modernize teacher education today, the strength of future generations? This raises the hypothesis that teacher education, as the foundation of a society, is continuously invested in and that programs are continually subject to reforms since the development of technology brings changes at all levels. Using heuristics methodology and case-study on teacher education at the Faculty of Educational Sciences of the University of Pula confirms that investments are made in the theoretical and in the practical part of the study because it increased the number of hours (3660 hours of theory and 350 hours of practice), students have the option of choosing elective courses according to their liking and can search for solutions of future employment at college-level, in our case: a module of English or computer science. A novelty is the possibility of student exchanges, where students can experience the different approaches to teaching in other countries.","authors":["Snjezana Mocinic","Ivana Paula Gortan-Carlin","Lorena LazariÄ‡"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["249704714_How_Teacher_Education_Matters","46657422_Can_Teacher_Education_Make_a_Difference","274273698_Preparing_Teachers_for_Their_Changing_Roles","47524917_Linking_Practice_and_Theory_The_Pedagogy_of_Realistic_Teacher_Education","46615193_Linking_Practice_and_Theory_The_Pedagogy_of_Realistic_Teacher_Education"]}
