In this paper, we introduce a realization of such a system by creating the first closed-loop battery-powered communication system between an IBM TrueNorth NS1e and an autonomous Android-Based Robotics platform. Using this system, we constructed a dataset of path following behavior by manually driving the Android-Based robot along steep mountain trails and recording video frames from the camera mounted on the robot along with the corresponding motor commands. We used this dataset to train a deep convolutional neural network implemented on the TrueNorth NS1e. The NS1e, which was mounted on the robot and powered by the robot's battery, resulted in a self-driving robot that could successfully traverse a steep mountain path in real time. To our knowledge, this represents the first time the TrueNorth NS1e neuromorphic chip has been embedded on a mobile platform under closed-loop control.","authors":["Tiffany Hwu","Jacob Isbell","Nicolas Oros","Jeff Krichmar"],"meta":["November 2016"],"references":["307541123_Training_Deep_Spiking_Neural_Networks_Using_Backpropagation","301837424_Convolutional_Networks_for_Fast_Energy-Efficient_Neuromorphic_Computing","301648615_End_to_End_Learning_for_Self-Driving_Cars","276481463_Spiking_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Energy-Efficient_Object_Recognition","274730358_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Deep_Learning_on_Highway_Driving","262216523_Event-based_neural_computing_on_an_autonomous_mobile_platform","311490163_Design_and_Tool_Flow_of_IBM's_TrueNorth_an_Ultra-Low_Power_Programmable_Neurosynaptic_Chip_with_1_Million_Neurons","292192469_Neuromorphic_electronic_systems","279169573_Trainable_sensorimotor_mapping_in_a_neuromorphic_robot","264630187_ARTIFICIAL_BRAINS_A_million_spiking-neuron_integrated_circuit_with_a_scalable_communication_network_and_interface"]}
