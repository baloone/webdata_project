{"id":"311670676_Computer_card_games_in_computer_science_education_A_10-year_review","abstract":"This paper presents a 10-year review study that focuses on the investigation of the use of computer card games (CCGs) as learning tools in Computer Science (CS) Education. Specific search terms keyed into 10 large scientific electronic databases identified 24 papers referring to the use of CCGs for the learning of CS matters during the last decade. The findings revealed that the CCGs reported by the reviewed papers were used for the learning of diverse CS issues. The motivation behind the use of the aforementioned CCGs was based on: (a) students' familiarity with the CGs at hand, so that they might focus on the construction of their simulation, (b) the fact that, the logic of CGs is suitable for the teaching of various CS concepts, and (c) CCG-play as a motivational activity to engage learners in their learning. CCGs were used in two ways: as CCG-construction context based on supportive data provided by educators, and as CCG-play educational tools. The constructivist learning approach was implied behind the design and use of most of the CCGs reported in the articles reviewed. Evaluation of some CCGs also provided positive results.","authors":["Maria Kordaki","Anthi Gousiou"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":["339457809_Encouraging_Teachers'_Reflection_Using_a_Card_Game_The_Game_of_Consequences","292739294_Designing_instructional_systems_83","284224562_A_7-Step_Modeling_Methodology_for_the_Design_of_Educational_Constructivist_Computer_Card_Games_Results_from_an_Empirical_Study","264597588_Serious_games_as_new_educational_tools_How_effective_are_they_A_meta-analysis_of_recent_studies","263222312_The_foundations_and_assumptions_of_technology-enhanced_student-centered_learning_environments","263196429_Ubiquitous_games_for_learning_UbiqGames_Weatherlings_a_worked_example","261860483_Teaching_artificial_intelligence_using_a_web-based_game_server","261351225_Robot_is_best_to_play_with_human","261235393_The_book_of_Ellie_An_interactive_book_for_teaching_the_alphabet_to_children","261207053_University_outreach_in_STEM_education_through_a_Roller_Coaster_Science_and_Engineering_Camp","260739789_Teaching_software_engineering_with_SimulES-W","260355907_Designing_Technology_for_Content-Independent_Collaborative_Mobile_Learning","259163176_FreshUP-A_pervasive_educational_game_for_freshmen","258875664_Digital_Health_Game_on_Cervical_Health_and_its_Effect_on_American_Women's_Cervical_Cancer_Knowledge","258161165_Teaching_Programming_in_the_Higher_Education_not_for_Engineering_Students","254462672_An_open-ended_environment_for_teaching_Java_in_context","254057947_Mobile_Applications_and_Museum_Visitation","249683353_Sex_Differences_in_Video_Game_PlayA_Communication-Based_Explanation","235969308_Framing_the_Adoption_of_Serious_Games_in_Formal_Education","230826242_Systematic_review_of_serious_games_for_medical_education_and_surgical_skills_training","228334252_Teaching_Agile_Software_Development_through_Lab_Courses","227029196_A_computer_card_game_for_the_learning_of_basic_aspects_of_the_binary_system_in_primary_education_Design_and_pilot_evaluation","225378629_Low_numeracy_and_dyscalculia_identification_and_intervention_ZDM_Mathematics_Education_42_527-539","318494438_Flow_the_psychology_of_optimal_experience","316856819_Literature_Review_in_Games_and_Learning","307992747_A_systematic_literature_review_of_games-based_learning_empirical_evidence_in_primary_education","306201541_Learning_with_technology_using_computers_as_cognitive_tools","295102660_Multimedia_Framework_for_Application_of_Spatial_Auditory_Information_to_Learning_Materials","284678235_Designing_Constructivist_Learning_Environments'_Instructional_Design_Theories_and_Models","282635739_A_systematic_literature_review_on_serious_games_evaluation_An_application_to_software_project_management","279644165_e-Learning_through_Experiential_Learning_Projects","273947296_The_Art_of_Computer_Game_Design","272177872_Mind_and_Society","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","265342603_Investigating_the_Effectiveness_of_an_Educational_Card_Game_for_Learning_How_Human_Immunology_Is_Regulated","262369155_Designing_CS1_as_an_eye-opening_tool_to_the_utility_of_computer_science_and_a_research-initiating_tool","261273269_Mobile_language_translation_game","261235285_Haptibasic_Learning_basic_concepts_of_a_haptic_technology_through_edutainment_games","261154991_Digital_game-based_after-school-assisted_learning_system_in_English","260050718_Implementing_Game-Based_Learning_The_MAPLET_Framework_as_a_Guide_to_Learner-Centred_Design_and_Assessment","238374519_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","235113027_The_Effectiveness_of_Instructional_Games_A_Literature_Review_and_Discussion","234799132_Using_BlueJ_and_Blackjack_to_teach_object-oriented_design_concepts_in_CS1","234795896_An_approach_to_teaching_object_oriented_design_in_CS2","234775713_Dealing_with_Piaget_Analyzing_Card_Games_for_Understanding_Concepts","230628116_A_systemic_literature_review_of_empirical_evidence_on_computer_games_and_serious_games","228831884_Refactoring_the_CS1_course","227163380_Development_of_Wireless_RFID_Glove_for_Various_Applications","226671293_The_effect_of_tools_of_a_computer_microworld_on_students'_strategies_regarding_the_concept_of_conservation_of_area","224137841_Component_Based_Software_Engineering_across_the_Curriculum","222785687_Using_game_theory_and_Competition-based_Learning_to_stimulate_student_motivation_and_performance","223735649_Educational_virtual_environments_A_ten-year_review_of_empirical_research_1999-2009","222541648_Speech-enabled_card_games_for_incidental_vocabulary_acquisition_in_a_foreign_language","222447286_A_Functional_Taxonomy_of_Multiple_Representations","222228030_A_drawing_and_multi-representational_computer_environment_for_beginners'_learning_of_programming_using_C_Design_and_pilot_formative_evaluation"]}
