{"id":"200086136_Data-driven_persona_development","abstract":"Much has been written on creating personas â both what they are good for, and how to create them. A common problem with personas is that they are not based on firsthand customer data, and if they are, the data set is not of a sample size that can be considered statistically significant. In this paper, we describe a new method for creating and validating personas, based on the statistical analysis of data, which is fast and cost effective.","authors":["Jennifer Sullivan McGinn","Jennifer","Nalini P.
