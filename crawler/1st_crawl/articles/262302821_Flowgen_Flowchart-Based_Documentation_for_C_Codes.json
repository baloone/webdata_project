{"id":"262302821_Flowgen_Flowchart-Based_Documentation_for_C_Codes","abstract":"We present the Flowgen tool, which generates flowcharts from annotated C++\nsource code. The tool generates a set of interconnected high-level UML activity\ndiagrams, one for each function or method in the C++ sources. It provides a\nsimple and visual overview of complex implementations of numerical algorithms.\nFlowgen is complementary to the widely-used Doxygen documentation tool. The\nultimate aim is to render complex C++ computer codes accessible, and to enhance\ncollaboration between programmers and algorithm or science specialists. We\ndescribe the tool and a proof-of-concept application to the VINCIA plug-in for\nsimulating collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.","authors":["David Kosower","Juanjo Lopez-Villarejo"],"meta":["May 2014Computer Physics Communications 196","DOI:10.1016/j.cpc.2015.05.029","SourcearXiv"],"references":["296889268_On_main_programming_paradigms","284672240_North","237106818_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_User_Guide"]}
