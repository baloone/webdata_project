{"id":"294287556_Technological_Change_in_Information_and_Communication_Consequences_for_Science","abstract":"Technological Change is not only a topic of academic research, it sometimes changes research itself. When technology creates new hardware (like the microscope, the printing press, the computer), it changes the way research is performed. When Technological Change modifies the basic structures of our communication system, it changes the way of scientific thinking. Much has been said about the mutual dependence of media and content. However, the raise of the internet and the dramatic increase of communicated information (Big Data) lead to a new situation.\nIn this contribution three possible consequences of such a development for scientific work are addressed. These developments are currently under discussion in Information Science. They will be of importance to all other scientific disciplines, too; e.g. the changes in the social system of science, the unsolved problems of long term storage of digital data, and the consequences of Big Data for statistical analysis, for correlation and for causality. Finally, this aspect of the Information Society is not only important for science; it will affect all parts of our life.","authors":["Wolf Rauch"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23324-6_8","In book: Dynamic Approaches to Global Economic Challenges (pp.131-140)"],"references":["285827880_Thinking_Fast_and_Slow","274692507_Understanding_Media_The_Extension_of_Man","269661257_The_Computerization_of_Society","259823367_Big_Data_A_Revolution_that_Will_Transform_how_We_Live_Work_and_Think","216435465_The_End_of_Theory_The_Data_Deluge_Makes_the_Scientific_Method_Obsolete","36814764_Theorie_des_Kommunikativen_Handelns","17552400_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science_The_reward_and_communication_systems_of_science_are_considered"]}
