{"id":"342249688_SCHOOLTHY_Automatic_Menu_Planner_for_Healthy_and_Balanced_School_Meals","abstract":"SCHOOLTHY: Automatic Menu Planner for Healthy and Balanced School Meals is a decision support tool that addresses the multi-objective menu planning problem in order to automatically produce meal plans for school canteens. Malnutrition is a widespread problem nowadays and is particularly serious when it affects children. In our environment, nutrition experts design healthy and balanced meal plans for children manually, which leaves significant room for improvement in terms of convenience and efficiency. SCHOOLTHY is presented herein as a proposal to improve and facilitate the work of these professionals. We focus on offering healthy and balanced meal plans that not only satisfy the recommended energy and nutrient intakes, but that also have a minimum cost and maximum variety of courses and food groups. Quantitative analyses that compare the meal plans yielded by SCHOOLTHY for meal plans designed by experts at hand and served in regional schools demonstrate the suitability of the proposal. Finally, we note that, thanks to its flexibility, SCHOOLTHY might be easily adapted to deal with other environments, such as hospitals, prisons and retirement homes, among others.","authors":["Eduardo Segredo","Gara Miranda Valladares","Juan Manuel Ramos","Coromoto Leon"],"meta":["June 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003067"],"references":["333888443_Designing_Optimal_Breakfast_for_the_United_States_Using_Linear_Programming_and_the_NHANES_2011-2014_Database_A_Study_from_the_International_Breakfast_Research_Initiative_IBRI","332243039_What_Are_the_Barriers_at_Home_and_School_to_Healthy_Eating_OverweightObese_Child_and_Parent_Perspectives","327822613_Mathematical_Optimization_to_Explore_Tomorrow's_Sustainable_Diets_A_Narrative_Review","322513791_Bacterial_Foraging_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Menu_Planning","316562531_A_review_on_automated_menu_planning_approaches","336587000_An_Evaluation_of_a_Meal_Planning_System_Ease_of_Use_and_Perceived_Usefulness","334310828_School_education_and_childhood_obesity_A_systemic_review","327404770_Factors_Influencing_the_Implementation_of_Nutrition_Policies_in_Schools_A_Scoping_Review","318376440_The_menu_planning_problem_a_multiobjective_approach_for_Brazilian_schools_context","308837129_Performances_in_GA-based_menu_production_for_hospital_meals"]}
