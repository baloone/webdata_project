{"id":"286878239_Using_learning_analytics_to_predict_and_improve_student_success_A_faculty_perspective","abstract":"Learning analytics is receiving increased attention, in part because it offers to assist educationalinstitutions in increasing student retention, improving student success, and easing the burden ofaccountability. Although these large-scale issues are worthy of consideration, faculty might alsobe interested in how they can use learning analytics in their own courses to help their studentssucceed. In this paper, we define learning analytics, how it has been used in educationalinstitutions, what learning analytics tools are available, and how faculty can make use of data intheir courses to monitor and predict student performance. Finally, we discuss several issues andconcerns with the use of learning analytics in higher education.","authors":["Beth Dietz","J.E.
