{"id":"305979088_On_quasi-stationary_distributions_in_absorbing_continuous-time_finite_Markov_chains","abstract":"In a recent paper, the authors have discussed the concept of quasi-stationary distributions for absorbing Markov chains having a finite state space, with the further restriction of discrete time. The purpose of the present note is to summarize the analogous results when the time parameter is continuous.","authors":["J. N. Darroch","E.
