{"id":"319203038_Verifying_a_Concurrent_Garbage_Collector_Using_a_Rely-Guarantee_Methodology","abstract":"Concurrent garbage collection algorithms are an emblematic challenge in the area of concurrent program verification. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a mechanized proof methodology based on the popular Rely-Guarantee (RG) proof technique. We design a specific compiler intermediate representation (IR) with strong type guarantees, dedicated support for abstract concurrent data structures, and high-level iterators on runtime internals. In addition, we define an RG program logic supporting an incremental proof methodology where annotations and invariants can be progressively enriched.","authors":["Yannick Zakowski","David Cachera","Delphine Demange","Gustavo Petri"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66107-0_31","Conference: International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving"],"references":["282485043_Relaxing_Safely_Verified_On-the-Fly_Garbage_Collection_for_x86-TSO","234800126_Tentative_Steps_Toward_a_Development_Method_for_Interfering_Programs","221032952_Implementing_an_On-the-Fly_Garbage_Collector_for_Java","220997638_Portable_Unobtrusive_Garbage_Collection_for_Multiprocessor_Systems","220997401_A_Calculus_of_Atomic_Actions","220751852_Schism_Fragmentation-Tolerant_Real-Time_Garbage_Collection","220369204_Concurrent_Separation_Logic_and_Operational_Semantics","200030230_Linearizability_A_Correctness_Condition_for_Concurrent_Objects","2774662_Concurrent_generational_garbage_collector_for_a_multithreaded_implementation_of_ML","2765406_Portable_Unobtrusive_Garbage_Collection_for_Multiprocessor_Systems","2612162_Mechanical_Verification_of_a_Garbage_Collector","345258044_Plan_B_a_buffered_memory_model_for_Java","326164155_Verified_compilation_of_linearizable_data_structures_mechanizing_rely_guarantee_for_semantic_refinement","325142264_Mechanized_Verification_of_Fine-Grained_Concurrent_Programs","300645984_Automated_and_Modular_Refinement_Reasoning_for_Concurrent_Programs","282486410_Mechanized_Verification_of_Fine-Grained_Concurrent_Programs","262241915_Rely-Guarantee-Based_Simulation_for_Compositional_Verification_of_Concurrent_Program_Transformations","252066697_The_Garbage_Collection_Handbook_The_Art_of_Automatic_Memory_Management","234786581_On-the-fly_Garbage_Collection_An_Exercise_in_Cooperation","221602488_The_rely-guarantee_method_in_IsabelleHOL","221403288_Verifying_the_Safety_of_a_Practical_Concurrent_Garbage_Collector","221241450_A_Certified_Framework_for_Compiling_and_Executing_Garbage-collected_Languages","221160576_Reusable_Verification_of_a_Copying_Collector","220700351_A_Marriage_of_RelyGuarantee_and_Separation_Logic","45913328_Automated_Verification_of_Practical_Garbage_Collectors","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures"]}
