{"id":"249712762_Research_article_abstracts_in_applied_linguistics_and_educational_technology_A_study_of_linguistic_realizations_of_rhetorical_structure_and_authorial_stance","abstract":"The abstract found at the beginning of most journal articles has increasingly become an essential part of the article. It tends to be the first part of the article to be read and, to some extent, it `sells' the article. Acquiring the skills of writing an abstract is therefore important to novice writers to enter the discourse community of their discipline. Based on 30 abstracts from three journals, the present study aims at exploring not only the rhetorical moves of abstracts in the fields of applied linguistics and educational technology, but also the linguistic realizations of moves and authorial stance in different abstract moves. The results show that there are three obligatory moves in abstracts in these two disciplines â€” Presenting the research, Describing the methodology, and Summarizing the results. The results also indicate that a combination of certain linguistic features such as grammatical subjects, verb tense and voice can help distinguish moves in the abstract. The findings of the study have some pedagogical implications for academic writing courses for graduate students, especially students from non-English backgrounds.","authors":["Phuong Pho"],"meta":["April 2008Discourse Studies 10(2):231-250","DOI:10.1177/1461445607087010"],"references":["308133711_How_to_write_a_research_proposal","301590353_Who_is_the_author_A_contrastive_analysis_of_authorial_presence_in_English_German_French_Russian_and_Bulgarian_academic_discourse","270479485_Discoursal_flaws_in_Medical_English_abstracts_A_genre_analysis_per_research-_and_text-type","245416996_Annotation_of_Biomedical_Texts_for_Zone_Analysis","235342149_Research_Genres_Explorations_and_Applications","223509112_Commitment_and_detachment_in_English_and_Bulgarian_academic_writing","222081171_On_RA_abstracts_From_rhetorical_structure_to_thematic_organisation","270914991_The_textual_organization_of_research_paper_abstracts_in_applied_linguistics","264677414_Attitudes_of_Journal_Editors_to_Nonnative_Speaker_Contributions","257273848_A_text-type_and_move_analysis_study_of_verb_tense_and_modality_distribution_in_medical_English_abstracts","249738511_A_Method_for_Analyzing_Sentence-Level_Differences_in_Disciplinary_Knowledge_Making","249712635_Stance_and_engagement_A_model_of_interaction_in_academic_discourse","249678730_Improving_the_Clarity_of_Journal_Abstracts_in_Psychology_The_Case_for_Structure","249237777_Towards_a_Validated_Analysis_of_Scientific_Text_Structure","239667929_Disciplinary_Discourses_Social_Interactions_in_Academic_Writing","235356439_The_discourse_of_research_and_practice_in_marketing_journals","235342143_Genre_analysis_English_in_academic_and_research_Settings","234671655_Talking_to_the_Academy_Forms_of_Hedging_in_Science_Research_Articles","234598950_Teaching_EFL_Students_to_Extract_Structural_Information_from_Abstracts","234592542_A_Genre_Analysis_of_English_and_Spanish_Research_Paper_Abstracts_in_Experimental_Social_Sciences","234563468_A_Genre_Analysis_Study_of_80_Medical_Abstracts","233590017_Evaluative_that_constructions_Signalling_stance_in_research_abstracts","223549369_Hooking_the_reader_A_corpus_study_of_evaluative_that_in_abstracts","223506353_Abstracts_in_German_medical_journals_A_linguistic_analysis","223367783_Aspects_of_theme_in_the_method_and_discussion_sections_of_biology_journal_articles_in_English","223037382_Evaluation_in_research_article_abstracts_in_the_narrative_and_hard_sciences","222295495_What_rules_govern_tense_usage_in_scientific_articles","220435626_Self-citation_and_Self-reference_Credibility_and_Promotion_in_Academic_Publication","44815541_A_Manual_for_writers_of_research_papers_theses_and_dissertations_Chicago_style_for_students_and_researchers","31377963_Genre_Analysis_and_the_Identification_of_Textual_Boundaries","2530760_The_Longman_Grammar_of_Spoken_and_Written_English"]}
