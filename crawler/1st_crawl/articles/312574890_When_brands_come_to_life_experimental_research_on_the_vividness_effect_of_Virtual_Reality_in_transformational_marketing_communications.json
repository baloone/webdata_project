{"id":"312574890_When_brands_come_to_life_experimental_research_on_the_vividness_effect_of_Virtual_Reality_in_transformational_marketing_communications","abstract":"Mobile Virtual Reality provides a gateway for marketers to innovatively reach consumers. This study examines the impact of Virtual Reality in the context of transformational brand experience appeals, focussing specifically on the determining role of vividness. A three-dimensional conceptual framework is presented, offering a systematic review of the literature on vividness effects in marketing communications, revealing the major gap that most available studies only focus on informational messages. We conducted an experiment to address this gap and demonstrate in the context of a transformational ad that Virtual Reality generates higher perceptions of vividness and presence than a regular two-dimensional video, with vividness positively affecting attitude toward the ad, both directly and indirectly via presence. Our study also reveals that vividness in turn elicits a positive effect on brand attitudes which stimulates consumersâ€™ purchase intentions. As such, the strategic potential of Virtual Reality for marketing communications is highlighted.","authors":["Helena Van Kerrebroeck","Malaika Brengman","Kim Willems"],"meta":["November 2017Virtual Reality 21(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10055-017-0306-3"],"references":["308955652_Exposure_to_an_unpleasant_odour_increases_the_sense_of_Presence_in_virtual_reality","303834406_An_objective_measure_for_the_visual_fidelity_of_virtual_reality_and_the_risks_of_falls_in_a_virtual_environment","289701272_Effectiveness_of_a_multidevice_3D_virtual_environment_application_to_train_car_service_maintenance_procedures","282886962_Retailing_in_social_virtual_worlds_Developing_a_typology_of_virtual_store_atmospherics","275414502_How_product_representation_shapes_virtual_experiences_and_re-patronage_intentions_the_role_of_mental_imagery_processing_and_experiential_value","271923537_Measuring_virtual_experience_in_a_three-dimensional_virtual_reality_interactive_simulator_environment_A_structural_equation_modeling_approach","352335233_Commercial_Speech_Intellectual_Property_Rights_and_Advertising_Using_Virtual_Images_Inserted_in_TV_Film_and_the_Real_World","311573689_A_Primer_on_Partial_Least_Squares_Structural_Equation_Modeling_PLS-SEM","288261209_Informational_and_transformational_advertising_The_differential_effects_of_time","273180676_A_seamless_solution_for_3D_real-time_interaction_design_and_evaluation"]}
