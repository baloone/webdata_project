{"id":"321449705_Sketching_Graphs_in_a_Calculus_MOOC_Preliminary_Results","abstract":"We developed an online sketch-based input and grading tool, which can be integrated into existing MOOC platforms; this tool allows students to construct graphs using mouse, touch, or pen input and provides immediate targeted feedback. This paper presents some preliminary results from use of this sketching tool in 18.01.1x Calculus 1A: Differentiation, an online calculus course offered by MIT on the edX platform.","authors":["Jennifer French","Martin A.
