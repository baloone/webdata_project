{"id":"282692574_DC_Decomposition_of_Nonconvex_Polynomials_with_Algebraic_Techniques","abstract":"We consider the problem of decomposing a multivariate polynomial as the difference of two convex polynomials. We introduce algebraic techniques which reduce this task to linear, second order cone, and semidefinite programming. This allows us to optimize over subsets of valid difference of convex decompositions (dcds) and find ones that speed up the convex–concave procedure. We prove, however, that optimizing over the entire set of dcds is NP-hard. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society","authors":["Amir Ali Ahmadi","Georgina Hall"],"meta":["October 2015Mathematical Programming 169(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10107-017-1144-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284085730_Variations_and_extension_of_the_convex-concave_procedure","322877870_How_to_Integrate_A_Polynomial_Over_A_Sphere","317425629_DSOS_and_SDSOS_Optimization_More_Tractable_Alternatives_to_Sum_of_Squares_and_Semidefinite_Optimization","316520415_Minimizing_polynomial_functions","313591186_Convex_analysis_approaches_to_DC_programming_Theory_algorithms_and_applications","307963021_Convex_analysis_approach_to_DC_Programming_Theory_algorithms_and_applications","294688997_Advances_in_neural_information_processing_systems_2","289111656_Efficient_inference_of_continuous_Markov_random_fields_with_polynomial_potentials","286644382_Minimizing_polynomial_functions_Algorithmic_and_quantitative_real_algebraic_geometry","284399932_On_subdifferential_calculus_and_duality_in_nonconvex_optimization"]}
