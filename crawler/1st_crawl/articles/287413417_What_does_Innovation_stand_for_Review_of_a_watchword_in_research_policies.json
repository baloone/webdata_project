{"id":"287413417_What_does_Innovation_stand_for_Review_of_a_watchword_in_research_policies","abstract":"Innovation is on the agenda of all scientific policies without really being defined. The study of the evolution of the works that argued to have defined a consisting concept of innovation (Bacon, Machiavelli), or developed a coherent theory of innovation (Tarde, Rogers, Schumpeter), provides insight into some weakness of the models of the innovation process (“linear theory”, “chain-linked model”), or even into the contradictions that are occulted by a naïve use of the concept. Innovation therefore appears as a “watchword” legitimizing that “everything changes so that nothing changes”.\nJEL codes: O31, O31, G38, O32, B25","authors":["Vincent Bontems"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Innovation Economics & Management 15(3):39","DOI:10.3917/jie.015.0039"],"references":["23545275_Skills_required_for_innovation_A_review_of_the_literature","266489140_National_Innovation_System_A_Note_on_the_Origins_of_a_Concept","258190259_The_linear_model_of_innovation_Maurice_Holland_and_the_research_cycle","254460457_No_92010_Why_Innovation_Theories_Make_no_Sense","236894838_The_New_Production_of_Knowledge_the_Dynamics_of_Science_and_Research_in_Contemporary_Societies","202187454_Du_Mode_d'Existence_des_Objets_Techniques"]}
