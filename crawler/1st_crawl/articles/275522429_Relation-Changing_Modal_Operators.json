{"id":"275522429_Relation-Changing_Modal_Operators","abstract":"We study dynamic modal operators that can change the accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation of a formula.\nIn particular, we extend the basic modal language with modalities that are able to delete, add or swap an edge between pairs\nof elements of the domain. We define a generic framework to characterize this kind of operations. First, we investigate relation-changing\nmodal logics as fragments of classical logics. Then, we use the new framework to get a suitable notion of bisimulation for\nthe logics introduced, and we investigate their expressive power. Finally, we show that the complexity of the model checking\nproblem for the particular operators introduced is PSpace-complete, and we study two subproblems of model checking: formula complexity and program complexity.","authors":["Carlos Areces","Raul Fervari","Guillaume Hoffmann"],"meta":["August 2015Logic Journal of IGPL 23(4)","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzv020","Project: Relation-Changing Logics"],"references":["319815053_Logics_with_Copy_and_Remove","277141984_Relation-Changing_Modal_Logics","266733236_Swap_logic","266388718_Logics_with_Copy_and_Remove","260345515_Moving_Arrows_and_Four_Model_Checking_Results","294684571_Knowledge_and_Belief","266524057_Modal_Logic","262974336_A_composable_language_for_action_models","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","259417593_Arrow_update_logic","254853660_Bisimulations_on_Planet_Kripke","254853007_Modal_Correspondence_Theory","254765750_Logics_for_information_update","254748632_Meeting_some_neighbours","251467769_Hybrid_Logics"]}
