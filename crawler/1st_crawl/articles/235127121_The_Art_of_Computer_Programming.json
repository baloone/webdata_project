{"id":"235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","abstract":"This report lists all corrections and changes to volumes 1 and 3 of The Art of Computer Programming, as of May 14, 1976. The changes apply to the most recent printings of both volumes (February and March, 1975); if you have an earlier printing there have been many other changes not indicated here. Volume 2 has been completely rewritten and its second edition will be published early in 1977. For a summary of the changes made to volume 2, see SIGSAM Bulletin 9, 4 (November 1975), p. 10f -- the changes are too numerous to list except in the forthcoming book itself.","authors":["D. E.
