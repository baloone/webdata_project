{"id":"257145081_An_algorithm_to_construct_independent_spanning_trees_on_parity_cubes","abstract":"Independent spanning trees have applications in networks such as reliable communication protocols, one-to-all broadcasting, reliable broadcasting, and secure message distribution. Thus, the designs of independent spanning trees in several classes of networks have been widely investigated. However, there is a conjecture on independent spanning trees: any nn-connected graph has nn independent spanning trees rooted at an arbitrary vertex. This conjecture still remains open for n≥5n≥5. In this paper, by proposing an algorithm to construct nn independent spanning trees rooted at any vertex, we confirm the conjecture on nn-dimensional parity cube PQnPQn —— a variant of nn-dimensional hypercube. Furthermore, we prove that all independent spanning trees rooted at an arbitrary vertex constructed by our construction method are isomorphic and the height of each tree is n+1n+1 for any integer n≥2n≥2.","authors":["Yan Wang","Jianxi Fan","Xiaohua Jia","He Huang"],"meta":["December 2012Theoretical Computer Science 465:61–72","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2012.08.020"],"references":["228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","221083876_Embedding_of_Binomial_Trees_in_Hypercubes_with_Link_Faults","220587447_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Hypercubes","220329881_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Multidimensional_Torus_Networks","220327777_Optimum_Broadcasting_and_Personalized_Communication_in_Hypercubes","4139026_Fault-Hamiltonicity_of_Hypercube-Like_Interconnection_Networks","264719533_Three_tree-paths","227103332_Independent_trees_in_graphs","223853286_Reliable_broadcasting_in_product_networks","223085074_Finding_nonseparating_induced_cycles_and_independent_spanning_trees_in_3-connected_graphs","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","221544009_Edge-Pancyclicity_of_Twisted_Cubes","221234126_Broadcasting_in_Hypercubes_with_Randomly_Distributed_Byzantine_Faults","220775948_Embedding_Cycles_into_Hypercubes_with_Prescribe_Vertices_in_the_Specific_Order","220618379_Finding_Four_Independent_Trees","220586101_The_Twisted-Cube_Connected_Networks","220567191_Broadcasting_secure_messages_via_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_in_folded_hypercubes","220397812_Independent_Trees_in_Planar_Graphs_Independent_trees","220379349_Independent_spanning_trees_on_twisted_cubes","220339861_The_diagnosability_of_hypercubes_with_arbitrarily_missing_links","220339166_Multi-node_broadcasting_in_all-ported_3-D_wormhole-routed_torus_using_an_aggregation-then-distribution_strategy","220317797_Fault-free_cycles_passing_through_prescribed_paths_in_hypercubes_with_faulty_edges","220315077_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_twisted_cubes","220315018_Embedding_meshes_into_locally_twisted_cubes","220314958_Embedding_meshes_into_twisted-cubes","220314376_Independent_spanning_trees_on_even_networks","220313683_Vertex-disjoint_spanning_trees_of_the_star_network_with_applications_to_fault-tolerance_and_security","220310873_Efficient_unicast_in_bijective_connection_networks_with_the_restricted_faulty_node_set","220155182_Constructing_independent_spanning_trees_for_locally_twisted_cubes","220152131_An_efficient_fault-tolerant_routing_algorithm_in_bijective_connection_networks_with_restricted_faulty_edges","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","220114461_Independent_spanning_trees_vs_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","220113832_The_spined_cube_A_new_hypercube_variant_with_smaller_diameter","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks","3300330_Efficient_broadcasting_in_wormhole-routed_multicomputers_A_network-partitioning_approach","3044867_The_tk-diagnosability_of_the_BC_graphs","3042345_Reliable_Broadcast_in_Hypercube_Multicomputers"]}
