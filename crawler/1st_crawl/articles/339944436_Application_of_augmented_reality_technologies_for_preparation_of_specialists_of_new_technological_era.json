{"id":"339944436_Application_of_augmented_reality_technologies_for_preparation_of_specialists_of_new_technological_era","abstract":"Augmented reality is one of the most modern information visualization technologies. Number of scientific studies on different aspects of augmented reality technology development and application is analyzed in the research. Practical examples of augmented reality technologies for various industries are described. Very often augmented reality technologies are used for: social interaction (communication, entertainment and games); education; tourism; areas of purchase/sale and presentation. There are various scientific and mass events in Ukraine, as well as specialized training to promote augmented reality technologies. There are following results of the research: main benefits that educational institutions would receive from introduction of augmented reality technology are highlighted; it is determined that application of augmented reality technologies in education would contribute to these technologies development and therefore need increase for specialists in the augmented reality; growth of students' professional level due to application of augmented reality technologies is proved; adaptation features of augmented reality technologies in learning disciplines for students of different educational institutions are outlined; it is advisable to apply integrated approach in the process of preparing future professionals of new technological era; application of augmented reality technologies increases motivation to learn, increases level of information assimilation due to the variety and interactivity of its visual representation. Main difficulties of application of augmented reality technologies are financial, professional and methodical. Following factors are necessary for introduction of augmented reality technologies: state support for such projects and state procurement for development of augmented reality technologies; conduction of scientific research and experimental confirmation of effectiveness and pedagogical expediency of augmented reality technologies application for training of specialists of different specialties; systematic conduction of number of national and international events on dissemination and application of augmented reality technology. It is confirmed that application of augmented reality technologies is appropriate for training of future specialists of new technological era.","authors":["Anna Iatsyshyn","Kovach Valeriia","Romanenko Y.O.","Deinega I.I."],"meta":["March 2019","Conference: 2nd International Workshop on Augmented Reality in Education, AREdu 2019At: Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine"],"references":["336232642_AUTOMATED_AND_INFORMATION_DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS_FOR_ENVIRONMENTAL_SAFETY","335629109_Augmented_Reality_experiment_in_higher_education_for_complex_system_appropriation_in_mechanical_design","335177695_SIMULATION_MODEL_OF_DAY_AHEAD_MARKET_WITH_IMPLICIT_CONSIDERATION_OF_POWER_SYSTEMS_NETWORK_CONSTRAINTS","332597455_Potentials_of_Augmented_Reality_in_Training","331948590_Analysis_of_Possible_Causes_of_NPP_Emergencies_to_Minimize_Risk_of_Their_Occurrence","331077023_Conceptual_Approaches_for_Development_of_Informational_and_Analytical_Expert_System_for_Assessing_the_NPP_impact_on_the_Environment","336119577_The_effect_of_Augmented_Reality_Technology_on_middle_school_students'_achievements_and_attitudes_towards_science_education","335078159_Research_trends_in_the_use_of_augmented_reality_in_science_education_Content_and_bibliometric_mapping_analysis","334277036_Technology_of_augmented_reality_in_textbooks_of_new_generation","329053395_Methods_and_Hardware_for_Diagnosing_Thermal_Power_Equipment_Based_on_Smart_Grid_Technology_Selected_Papers_from_the_International_Conference_on_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technologies_CSIT_2018_"]}
