{"id":"340418194_Graphs_of_bounded_cliquewidth_are_polynomially_ch-bounded","abstract":"We prove that if $\\mathcal{C}$ is a hereditary class of graphs that is polynomially $\\chi$-bounded, then the class of graphs that admit decompositions into pieces belonging to $\\mathcal{C}$ along cuts of bounded rank is also polynomially $\\chi$-bounded. In particular, this implies that for every positive integer $k$, the class of graphs of cliquewidth at most $k$ is polynomially $\\chi$-bounded.","authors":["Marthe Bonamy","Michal Pilipczuk"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.19086/aic.13668"],"references":["345962568_The_Grid_Theorem_for_vertex-minors","347755919_Circle_graphs_are_quadratically_ch-bounded","333768421_Classes_of_graphs_with_no_long_cycle_as_a_vertex-minor_are_polynomially_ch-bounded","330107275_Polynomial_ch-binding_functions_and_forbidden_induced_subgraphs-a_survey","311094290_Induced_Subgraphs_of_Graphs_with_Large_Chromatic_Number_III_Long_Holes","281884530_A_Combinatorial_Theorem_for_Trees","268620905_Problems_from_the_world_surrounding_perfect_graphs","243132562_Matchings_Matroids_and_Unimodular_Matrices","242910830_Induced_Trees_in_Graphs_of_Large_Chromatic_Number","228610707_Substitution_and_ch-boundedness"]}
