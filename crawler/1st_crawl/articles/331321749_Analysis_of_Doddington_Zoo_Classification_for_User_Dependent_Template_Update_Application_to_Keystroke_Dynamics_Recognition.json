{"id":"331321749_Analysis_of_Doddington_Zoo_Classification_for_User_Dependent_Template_Update_Application_to_Keystroke_Dynamics_Recognition","abstract":"Biometric authentication systems are increasingly considered in different access control applications. Regarding that users have completely different interactions with these authentication systems, several techniques have been developed in the literature to model distinctive users categories. Doddington zoo is a biometric menagerie that defines and labels user groups with animal species to reflect their behavior with the biometric systems. This menagerie was developed for different biometric modalities including keystroke dynamics. The present study proposes a user dependent adaptive strategy based on the Doddington zoo, for the recognition of the user's keystroke dynamics. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in applying an adaptive strategy specific to the characteristics of each user of the Doddington zoo menagerie aiming to solve the intra-class variation problems. The obtained results demonstrate competitive performances on significant keystroke dynamics datasets WEBGREYC and CMU.","authors":["Abir Mhenni","Estelle Cherrier","Christophe Rosenberger","Najoua ESSOUKRI BEN AMARA"],"meta":["February 2019Future Generation Computer Systems 97:210-218","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2019.02.039"],"references":["330996294_Double_Serial_Adaptation_Mechanism_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Authentication_based_on_a_Single_Password","329184422_User_Dependent_Template_Update_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Recognition","326942813_Adaptive_Biometric_Strategy_using_Doddington_Zoo_Classification_of_User's_Keystroke_Dynamics","325909183_Towards_a_Secured_Authentication_Based_on_an_Online_Double_Serial_Adaptive_Mechanism_of_Users'_Keystroke_Dynamics","305705432_Keystroke_template_update_with_adapted_thresholds","327949049_RBN_An_Adaptive_Model_for_Keystroke-Dynamics-Based_Educational_Level_Classification","327194247_Cross_Keyboard_Keystroke_Dynamics","326566907_An_Adaptive_Typing_Biometric_System_with_Varying_users_Model","311338093_Secure_integration_of_IoT_and_Cloud_Computing","310390981_Online_Cross-Modal_Adaptation_for_Audio-Visual_Person_Identification_With_Wearable_Cameras"]}
