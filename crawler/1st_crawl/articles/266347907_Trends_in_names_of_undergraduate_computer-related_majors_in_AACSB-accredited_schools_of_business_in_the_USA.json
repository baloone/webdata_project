{"id":"266347907_Trends_in_names_of_undergraduate_computer-related_majors_in_AACSB-accredited_schools_of_business_in_the_USA","abstract":"Information systems, management information systems, computer information systems, business information systems, and information technology are some of the names referring to a relatively new discipline in traditional business school offerings. Professionals and educators in this discipline want to assure that such programs continue to meet the needs of their stakeholders. As a first step in researching the trends in IS education, the authors investigated the incidence of computer-related majors in accredited business schools and their names, then compared the data with that of three years ago. The results provide evidence that although information systems programs remain common, there is no move toward standardization of the majors' names.","authors":["J K Pierson","S. E.
