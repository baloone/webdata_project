{"id":"317062124_Clique-Width_for_Graph_Classes_Closed_under_Complementation","abstract":"Clique-width is an important graph parameter due to its algorithmic and structural properties. A graph class is hereditary if it can be characterized by a (not necessarily finite) set ${\\cal H}$ of forbidden induced subgraphs. We initiate a systematic study into the boundedness of clique-width of hereditary graph classes closed under complementation. First, we extend the known classification for the $|{\\cal H}|=1$ case by classifying the boundedness of clique-width for every set ${\\cal H}$ of self-complementary graphs. We then completely settle the $|{\\cal H}|=2$ case. In particular, we determine one new class of $(H,\\overline{H})$-free graphs of bounded clique-width (as a side effect, this leaves only six classes of $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs, for which it is not known whether their clique-width is bounded). Once we have obtained the classification of the $|{\\cal H}|=2$ case, we research the effect of forbidding self-complementary graphs on the boundedness of clique-width. Surprisingly, we show that for a set ${\\cal F}$ of self-complementary graphs on at least five vertices, the classification of the boundedness of clique-width for $(\\{H,\\overline{H}\\}\\cup {\\cal F})$-free graphs coincides with the one for the $|{\\cal H}|=2$ case if and only if ${\\cal F}$ does not include the bull (the only non-empty self-complementary graphs on fewer than five vertices are $P_1$ and $P_4$, and $P_4$-free graphs have clique-width at most $2$). Finally, we discuss the consequences of our results for Colouring and Graph Isomorphism.","authors":["Alexandre Blanch√©","Konrad Kazimierz Dabrowski","Matthew Johnson","Vadim Lozin"],"meta":["May 2017SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 34(2)","DOI:10.1137/18M1235016"],"references":["321307006_Clique-width_and_Well-Quasi-Ordering_of_Triangle-Free_Graph_Classes","317825988_Colouring_Diamond-free_Graphs","303498975_The_Behavior_of_Clique-Width_under_Graph_Operations_and_Graph_Transformations","329187158_Hereditary_graph_classes_When_the_complexities_of_coloring_and_clique_cover_coincide_BLANCHE_et_al","317096017_How_to_solve_NP-hard_graph_problems_on_clique-width_bounded_graphs_in_polynomial_time","312167792_Graph_isomorphism_for_graph_classes_characterized_by_two_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","305363504_Bounding_clique-width_via_perfect_graphs","304890985_Clique-Width_of_Graph_Classes_Defined_by_Two_Forbidden_Induced_Subgraphs","302502264_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Rank_Width","302067893_Bounding_the_clique-width_of_H-free_split_graphs"]}
