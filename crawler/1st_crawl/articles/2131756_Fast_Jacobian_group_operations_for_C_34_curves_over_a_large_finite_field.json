{"id":"2131756_Fast_Jacobian_group_operations_for_C_34_curves_over_a_large_finite_field","abstract":"Let C be an arbitrary smooth algebraic curve of genus g over a large finite field K. We revisit fast addition algorithms in the Jacobian of C due to Khuri-Makdisi (math.NT/0409209, to appear in Math. Comp.). The algorithms, which reduce to linear algebra in vector spaces of dimension O(g) once |K| >> g, and which asymptotically require O(g^{2.376}) field operations using fast linear algebra, are shown to perform efficiently even for certain low genus curves. Specifically, we provide explicit formulae for performing the group law on Jacobians of C_{3,4} curves of genus 3. We show that, typically, the addition of two distinct elements in the Jacobian of a C_{3,4} curve requires 117 multiplications and 2 inversions in K, and an element can be doubled using 129 multiplications and 2 inversions in K. This represents an improvement of approximately 20% over previous methods.","authors":["Fatima Abu Salem","Kamal Khuri-Makdisi"],"meta":["November 2006LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics 10","DOI:10.1112/S146115700000142X","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220334684_Fast_addition_on_non-hyperelliptic_genus_3","248496619_Zur_Divisorenklassengruppenberechnung_in_globalen_Funktionenkorpern","225771651_Implementing_the_Arithmetic_of_C34_Curves","221451455_An_Index_Calculus_Algorithm_for_Plane_Curves_of_Small_Degree","221010711_Fast_Arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_Curves","220661793_On_Using_Expansions_to_the_Base_of_-2","220336354_Index_Calculus_in_Class_Groups_of_Plane_Curves_of_Small_Degree","220334307_Fast_arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_curves","29604491_The_arithmetic_of_Jacobian_groups_of_superelliptic_cubics","2114770_Asymptotically_fast_group_operations_on_Jacobians_of_general_curves"]}
