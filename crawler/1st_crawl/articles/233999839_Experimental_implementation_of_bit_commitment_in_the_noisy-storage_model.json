{"id":"233999839_Experimental_implementation_of_bit_commitment_in_the_noisy-storage_model","abstract":"Fundamental primitives such as bit commitment and oblivious transfer serve as building blocks for many other two-party protocols. Hence, the secure implementation of such primitives is important in modern cryptography. Here we present a bit commitment protocol that is secure as long as the attacker's quantum memory device is imperfect. The latter assumption is known as the noisy-storage model. We experimentally executed this protocol by performing measurements on polarization-entangled photon pairs. Our work includes a full security analysis, accounting for all experimental error rates and finite size effects. This demonstrates the feasibility of two-party protocols in this model using real-world quantum devices. Finally, we provide a general analysis of our bit commitment protocol for a range of experimental parameters.","authors":["Nelly Ng","Siddarth Koduru Joshi","Chia Chen Ming","Christian Kurtsiefer"],"meta":["December 2012Nature Communications 3(1):1326","DOI:10.1038/ncomms2268","SourcePubMed"],"references":["231155606_Highly_multimode_storage_in_a_crystal","230649727_Experimental_quantum_tossing_of_a_single_coin","228935639_Quantum_bit_commitment_revisited_the_possible_and_the_impossible","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","303544253_Entanglement_Cost_of_Quantum_Channels","265603271_Security_of_quantum_key_distribution","260197640_Faked_states_attack_on_quantum_cryptosystems","258373329_Unconditional_security_from_noisy_quantum_storage","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","234790546_Founding_crytpography_on_oblivious_transfer"]}
