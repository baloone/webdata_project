{"id":"339548076_Efficient_Chain_Structure_for_High-Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","abstract":"High-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is an emerging topic in data mining, which considers both utility and sequence factors to derive the set of high-utility sequential patterns (HUSPs) from the quantitative databases. Several works have been presented to reduce the computational cost by variants of pruning strategies. In this paper, we present an efficient sequence-utility (SU)-chain structure, which can be used to store more relevant information to improve mining performance. Based on the SU-Chain structure, the existing pruning strategies can also be utilized here to early prune the unpromising candidates and obtain the satisfied HUSPs. Experiments are then compared with the state-of-the-art HUSPM algorithms and the results showed that the SU-Chain-based model can efficiently improve the efficiency performance than the existing HUSPM algorithms in terms of runtime and number of the determined candidates.","authors":["Chun-Wei Jerry Lin","Yuanfa Li","Philippe Fournier Viger","Youcef Djenouri"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976662"],"references":["318857473_High-Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_with_Multiple_Minimum_Utility_Thresholds","307614061_EFIM_a_fast_and_memory_efficient_algorithm_for_high-utility_itemset_mining","297727740_A_binary_PSO_approach_to_mine_high-utility_itemsets","290197992_On_efficiently_mining_high_utility_sequential_patterns","289367292_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_High-Utility_Itemsets_in_Uncertain_Databases","282545681_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_Top-K_High_Utility_Itemsets","275243808_CRoM_and_HuspExt_Improving_Efficiency_of_High_Utility_Sequential_Pattern_Extraction","337018755_ProUM_Projection-Based_Utility_Mining_on_Sequence_Data","319393506_Mining_Sequential_Patterns_Generalizations_and_Performance_Improvements","310049843_An_ACO-based_Approach_to_Mine_High-Utility_Itemsets"]}
