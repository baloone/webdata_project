{"id":"273574495_TStore_A_Trace-Base_Management_System_using_Finite-State_Transducer_Approach_for_Trace_Transformation","abstract":"This paper presents TStore, a Trace-Base Management System (TBMS) handling storage, transformation and exploitation of traces collected by external applications. As the experiments reported in this paper demonstrate, TStore brings a solution to performances and storage issues usually encountered by TBMS. To exploit traces, transformations are used. TStore provides predefined transformation functions as well as a customized transformation based on Finite State Transducers (FST), which are also presented in this paper.","authors":["Raafat Zarka","Pierre-Antoine Champin","Am√©lie Cordier","Elod Egyed-zsigmond"],"meta":["February 2013","DOI:10.5220/0004317301170122","Conference: International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development (MODELSWARD 2013)At: Barcelona, Spain"],"references":["26251603_Genome_sequence_data_Management_storage_and_visualization","222554966_Automating_Web_navigation_with_the_WebVCR","220712012_ConTask_-_Using_Context-sensitive_Assistance_to_Improve_Task-oriented_Knowledge_Work"]}
