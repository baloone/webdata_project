{"id":"2206423_On_the_decidability_of_semigroup_freeness","abstract":"This paper deals with the decidability of semigroup freeness. More precisely,\nthe freeness problem over a semigroup S is defined as: given a finite subset X\nof S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over X. To\ndate, the decidabilities of two freeness problems have been closely examined.\nIn 1953, Sardinas and Patterson proposed a now famous algorithm for the\nfreeness problem over the free monoid. In 1991, Klarner, Birget and Satterfield\nproved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer\nmatrices. Both results led to the publication of many subsequent papers. The\naim of the present paper is three-fold: (i) to present general results\nconcerning freeness problems, (ii) to study the decidability of freeness\nproblems over various particular semigroups (special attention is devoted to\nmultiplicative matrix semigroups), and (iii) to propose precise, challenging\nopen questions in order to promote the study of the topic.","authors":["Julien Cassaigne","Francois Nicolas"],"meta":["September 2008RAIRO - Theoretical Informatics and Applications 46(3)","DOI:10.1051/ita/2012010","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324465871_Mortality_for_Sets_of_2_2_Matrices","324457748_More_on_Mortality","319394622_Introduction_to_Automata_Theory_Languages_and_Computation_2nd_Edition","281793182_Combinatorics_on_Words","269566064_Mortality_for_Sets_of_2_2_Matrices","268549900_Unsolvability_in_33_matrices","266841201_Parties_rationnelles_du_groupe_libre","266252329_Mortality_of_2_2_Matrices","265534075_Free_semigroups_of_22_matrices","265465529_Combinatorial_group_theory_Kombinatornaya_teoriya_grupp_Transl_from_the_English_by_Yu_A_Bakhturin"]}
