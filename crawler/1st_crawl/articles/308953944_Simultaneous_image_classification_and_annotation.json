{"id":"308953944_Simultaneous_image_classification_and_annotation","abstract":"Image classification and annotation are important prob- lems in computer vision, but rarely considered together. In- tuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely anno- tated with words “road,” “car,” and “traffic” than words “fish,” “boat,” and “scuba.” In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats an- notation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation perfor- mance, and superior classification performance.","authors":["Chong Wang","David Blei","Li Fei-Fei"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5206800"],"references":["226435002_An_Introduction_to_Variational_Methods_for_Graphical_Models","225741505_Object_Recognition_as_Machine_Translation_Learning_a_Lexicon_for_a_Fixed_Image_Vocabulary","221260187_Conditional_Random_Field_for_Natural_Scene_Categorization","221113880_A_Semantic_Typicality_Measure_for_Natural_Scene_Categorization","220660282_Saliency_Scale_and_Image_Description","220343825_Hofmann_T_Unsupervised_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_Machine_Learning_421-2_177-196","220320260_Image_Categorization_by_Learning_and_Reasoning_with_Regions","4301709_What_where_and_who_Classifying_events_by_scene_and_object_recognition","4193873_Modeling_Scenes_with_Local_Descriptors_and_Latent_Aspects","2950087_Modeling_Annotated_Data","2832818_Matching_Words_and_Pictures","285906939_Numerical_optimization","239062248_Estimating_a_Dirichlet_distribution","221617863_Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_Learning_with_Application_to_Scene_Classification","221364059_A_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Model_for_Learning_Natural_Scene_Categories","221304071_Scene_classification_via_pLSA","220660299_Modeling_the_Shape_of_the_Scene_A_Holistic_Representation_of_the_Spatial_Envelope","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220017593_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Indexing","37992037_LabelMe_A_Database_and_Web-Based_Tool_for_Image_Annotation","37991995_Discovering_object_categories_in_image_collections","4301633_Spatially_Coherent_Latent_Topic_Model_for_Concurrent_Segmentation_and_Classification_of_Objects_and_Scenes","4246240_Using_Multiple_Segmentations_to_Discover_Objects_and_their_Extent_in_Image_Collections","4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories","3816624_Object_Recognition_from_Local_Scale-Invariant_Features","3327297_Image_classification_for_content-based_indexing_IEEE_Trans_Image_Process","2480258_Automatic_Image_Annotation_and_Retrieval_using_Cross-Media_Relevance_Models","2402022_Indoor-Outdoor_Image_Classification"]}
