{"id":"329040608_Effects_of_spatial_consistency_and_individual_difference_on_touch-induced_visual_suppression_effect","abstract":"Crossmodal studies have reported not only facilitatory but also inhibitory perceptual interactions. For instance, tactile stimulation to the index finger of a hand leads to the degradation of visual discrimination performance (touch-induced visual suppression, TIVS). It has been suggested that the magnitude of TIVS depends on the spatial congruency of visuo-tactile stimuli and on individual differences in task performance. We performed a detailed investigation of the effects of spatial consistency and individual differences on the occurrence of TIVS. The visual target and tactile stimulus were presented at co-localized, ipsilateral but not co-localized, or contralateral positions. The degree of autistic traits has been reported to be well variable among the general population and to reflect differences in sensory processing. Therefore, we assessed the magnitude of autistic traits using the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) as an index of individual differences. TIVS occurred particularly at the ipsilateral but not co-localized position. In contrast, the magnitude of the TIVS was positively correlated with the AQ score when the stimuli were presented at the co-localized position. These findings suggest that the occurrence of TIVS can be modulated both by the spatial relationship between the visual and tactile stimuli and by individual differences in autistic traits.","authors":["Souta Hidaka"],"meta":["November 2018Scientific Reports 8(1):17018","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-35302-w"],"references":["326887164_Relating_the_perception_of_visual_ensemble_statistics_to_individual_levels_of_autistic_traits","324571727_Proscription_supports_robust_perceptual_integration_by_suppression_in_human_visual_cortex","322640296_Peripersonal_Space_An_Index_of_Multisensory_Body-Environment_Interactions_in_Real_Virtual_and_Mixed_Realities","320717280_Increases_in_the_autistic_trait_of_attention_to_detail_are_associated_with_decreased_multisensory_temporal_adaptation","315970488_Salivary_Oxytocin_Concentration_Associates_with_the_Subjective_Feeling_of_Body_Ownership_during_the_Rubber_Hand_Illusion","345317861_Autism_and_Asperger_Syndrome_Preparing_for_Adulthood","325349283_An_Investigation_of_the_Relationships_Between_Autistic_Traits_and_Crossmodal_Correspondences_in_Typically_Developing_Adults","322149043_Distinct_Autistic_Traits_Are_Differentially_Associated_With_the_Width_of_the_Multisensory_Temporal_Binding_Window","320403622_Disrupted_integration_of_exteroceptive_and_interoceptive_signaling_in_autism_spectrum_disorder_Cardiovisual_temporal_binding_window_in_ASD","318568521_Simultaneous_intrinsic_signal_imaging_of_auditory_and_visual_cortex_reveals_profound_effects_of_acute_hearing_loss_on_visual_processing"]}
