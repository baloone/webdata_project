In our second paper, the training and validation datasets were split in 70% and 30% of the total data, similar to our first paper. The second paper was focused on a computer science audience; an analysis of the optimal hyper-parameters for different classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, MultiLayer Perceptron Neural Network and Decision Tree Classifier) was included. In addition, the training and cross-validation scores were provided and analyzed in the hyper-parameter setting procedure to avoid any overfitting or bias in the evaluation results. We encourage readers to view this latest study if details regarding the deep learning implementation are required.","authors":["Yuanyuan Yao","Jenny Cifuentes","Bin Zheng","Min Yan"],"meta":["December 2021Journal of Translational Medicine 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12967-021-02929-9","Project: Clinical outcome assessment"],"references":["351141544_Comment_on_Computer_algorithm_can_match_physicians'_decisions_about_blood_transfusions","340153350_Blood_transfusion_prediction_using_restricted_Boltzmann_machines","336407878_Computer_algorithm_can_match_physicians'_decisions_about_blood_transfusions"]}
