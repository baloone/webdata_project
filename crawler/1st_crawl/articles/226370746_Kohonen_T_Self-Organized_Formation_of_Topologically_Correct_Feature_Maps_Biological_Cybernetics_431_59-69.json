The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.","authors":["Teuvo Kohonen"],"meta":["January 1982Biological Cybernetics 43(1):59-69","DOI:10.1007/BF00337288"],"references":["226282988_Self-organization_of_orientation_sensitive_cells_in_striate_cortex","22866263_How_to_label_nerve_cells_so_that_they_can_interconnect_in_an_ordered_fashion","18399991_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_the_Functional_Dynamics_of_Cortical_and_Thalamic_Nervous_Tissue","269016547_Associative_memory_A_system-theoretical_approach","247712522_Notes_on_the_hypothesis_of_columnar_organization_in_somatosensory_cerebral_cortex","243758364_Automatic_formation_of_topological_maps_in_a_self-organizing_system","243673341_Modality_and_topographic_properties_of_single_neurons_of_cat's_somatic_sensory_cortex","242554268_The_Organization_of_Behavior","229091433_Principles_of_Neurodynamics_Perceptrons_and_the_Theory_of_Brain_Mechanisms","227930420_Tonotopic_organization_in_auditory_cortex_of_the_cat","226965853_Simplified_neuron_model_as_a_principal_component_analyzer","23119935_How_Patterned_Neural_Connections_Can_Be_Set_Up_by_Self-Organization","23093096_A_Marker_Induction_Mechanism_for_the_Establishment_of_Ordered_Neural_Mappings_Its_Application_to_the_Retinotectal_Problem","22253071_The_effect_of_monocular_exposure_to_temporal_contrasts_on_ocular_dominance_in_kittens","18381312_Self-organization_of_orientation_sensitive_cells_in_the_striate_cortex","17079967_A_Model_for_the_Formation_of_Ocular_Dominance_Stripes","16949272_Topographic_organization_of_nerve_fields","10127891_Modality_and_topographic_properties_of_single_neurons_of_cat''''s_somatic_sensory_cortex","8404880_Changes_in_the_circuitry_of_the_kitten_visual_cortex_are_gated_by_postsynaptic_activity"]}
