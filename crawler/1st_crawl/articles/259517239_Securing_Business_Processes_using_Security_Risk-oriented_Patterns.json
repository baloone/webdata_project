{"id":"259517239_Securing_Business_Processes_using_Security_Risk-oriented_Patterns","abstract":"Business process modelling and security engineering are two important concerns when developing information system (IS). However current practices report that security is addressed rather at the later development stages (i.e. design and implementation). This raises a question whether the business processes are performed securely. In this paper, we propose a method to introduce security requirements to the business processes through the collaboration between business and security analysts. To support such a collaboration we present a set of security risk-oriented patterns. We use the BPMN notation to present these patterns graphically. We test our proposal in two industrial business models. The case findings characterise pattern performance when identifying the business assets, potential risks and their countermeasures.","authors":["Naved Ahmed","Raimundas Matuleviƒçius"],"meta":["January 2013Computer Standards & Interfaces 36(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.csi.2013.12.007"],"references":["267559037_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Extensions_to_Secure_Tropos_to_Support_Security_Risk_Management","265206949_Security_Requirements_Engineering_for_Business_Processes","264890432_Towards_Definition_of_Secure_Business_Processes","262326060_Aligning_Mal-activity_Diagrams_and_Security_Risk_Management_for_Security_Requirements_Definitions","254759520_RiskREP_Risk-based_security_requirements_elicitation_and_prioritization","251005215_A_survey_on_security_patterns","250797780_Model-Based_Security_Analysis_in_Seven_Steps_-_a_Guided_Tour_to_the_CORAS_Method","241462897_A_Systematic_Approach_to_Define_the_Domain_of_Information_System_Security_Risk_Management","228708788_Towards_a_Measurement_Framework_for_Security_Risk_Management","226394333_Proactive_Secret_Sharing_Or_How_to_Cope_With_Perpetual_Leakage","224516592_PABRE_Pattern-based_Requirements_Elicitation","224106068_A_roadmap_to_risk-aware_business_process_management","221552286_Mal-Activity_Diagrams_for_Capturing_Attacks_on_Business_Processes","221430751_A_Model-Driven_engineering_approach_with_diagnosis_of_non-conformance_of_security_objectives_in_business_process_models","221233446_NetBouncer_Client-legitimacy-based_High-performance_DDoS_Filtering","220816487_A_Survey_on_Detection_Techniques_to_Prevent_Cross-Site_Scripting_Attacks_on_Current_Web_Applications","220499088_Incorporating_risk_into_business_process_models","220480803_Security_requirement_analysis_of_business_processes","220459388_Protection_Against_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_A_Survey","220458141_A_Denial_of_Service_Detector_based_on_Maximum_Likelihood_Detection_and_the_Random_Neural_Network","220195243_Controlling_High_Bandwidth_Aggregates_in_the_Network","31367121_A_BPMN_Extension_for_the_Modeling_of_Security_Requirements_in_Business_Processes","27482767_Integrating_Risks_in_Business_Process_Models","2393383_Software_Engineering_for_Security_a_Roadmap","2339042_Role_Based_Access_Control_on_MLS_Systems_without_Kernel_Changes","292798049_Cryptographic_privacy_protection_techniques","292795469_A_template_of_security_risk_patterns_for_business_processes","292585991_Multilevel_security","291916359_SQL_Injection_Attacks_and_Defense","288170514_Towards_Security_Risk-Oriented_Misuse_Cases","272536055_Eliciting_Security_Requirements_from_the_Business_Processes_Using_Security_Risk-Oriented_Patterns","242561104_Guide_for_Implementing_the_Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act_HIPAA_Security_Rule","235107472_Secure_Computer_System_Unified_Exposition_and_Multics_Interpretation","221550525_Agent_mediated_provision_of_insurance_services_two_case_studies_fraud_and_repairs","221252952_Detecting_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_DDoS_Attacks_through_Inductive_Learning","221204804_Business_Process-Based_Information_Security_Risk_Assessment","220692878_Secure_Systems_Development_with_UML","220480831_Security_Analysis_of_Electronic_Business_Processes","220268496_Non-Functional_Requirements_in_Business_Process_Modeling","220196845_Secure_business_process_model_specification_through_a_UML_20_activity_diagram_profile","30512823_Model-based_Management_of_Information_System_Security_Risk","4251452_Engineering_Safety_and_Security_Related_Requirements_for_Software_Intensive_Systems","3437744_Seven_Pernicious_Kingdoms_A_Taxonomy_of_Software_Security_Errors","3335485_Statistical_Techniques_for_Detecting_Traffic_Anomalies_Through_Packet_Header_Data","3196694_Defending_Against_Flooding-Based_Distributed_Denial-of-service_Attacks_A_Tutorial"]}
