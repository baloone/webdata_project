{"id":"324416366_Students_motivation_for_adopting_programming_contests_Innovation-diffusion_perspective","abstract":"Within the context of Rogers theory of perceived attributes, authors propose a framework that can predict studentsâ€™ motivation to adopt programming contest like ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). In this paper we investigate the attributes for adoption of programming contest in a social group comprising of (N = 1245) undergraduate engineering students from the regional finals of the contest held in India over a period of 3 years. The results revealed that student motivations are strongly associated with attributes like relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, peer influence, perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness. Overall, students expressed positive attitude towards adopting programming contests as it helped improve their problem solving and programming skills and overall employability. Both gender was in agreement that joining and winning programming contests is a status symbol.","authors":["Raghu Raman","Hardik Vachharajani","Krishnashree Achuthan"],"meta":["September 2018Education and Information Technologies 23(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-018-9697-3"],"references":["291246389_Modeling_Diffusion_of_Tabletop_for_Collaborative_Learning_Using_Interactive_Science_Lab_Simulations","275014340_Attracting_Students_to_the_Computing_Disciplines_A_Case_Study_of_a_Robotics_Contest","313467367_Competitive_learning_in_informatics_The_UVa_online_judge_experience","311491382_A_Programming_Contest_Strategy_Guide","311472059_Common_mistakes_in_online_and_real-time_contests","290109443_Teaching_for_Transfer_of_Problem-Solving_Skills_to_Computer_Programming","287651935_Development_of_an_instrument_to_measure_perceptions_of_adoption_of_an_information_technology_innovations","287182963_Knowledge_sharing_in_crowdsourcing-it_is_more_than_motivation","277434875_Individual_characteristics_associated_with_World_Wide_Web_use","277374591_Lowering_the_barriers_to_programming","270820426_Making_Sense_of_Cronbach's_Alpha","270631635_The_VLAB_OER_experience_Modeling_potential-adopter_student_acceptance","270606044_Computer_science_olympiad","265746136_Chapter_6_Individual_Acceptance_of_Information_Technologies","262252884_Task_Design_Motivation_and_Participation_in_Crowdsourcing_Contests"]}
