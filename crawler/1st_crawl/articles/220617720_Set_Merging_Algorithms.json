{"id":"220617720_Set_Merging_Algorithms","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of merging sets formed from a total of n items in such a way that at any time, the name of a set containing a given item can be ascertained. Two algorithms using different data structures are discussed. The execution times of both algorithms are bounded by a constant times $nG(n)$, where $G(n)$ is a function whose asymptotic growth rate is less than that of any finite number of logarithms of n.","authors":["John E.
