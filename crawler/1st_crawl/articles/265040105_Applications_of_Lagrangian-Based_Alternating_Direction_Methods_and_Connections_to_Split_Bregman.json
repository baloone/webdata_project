{"id":"265040105_Applications_of_Lagrangian-Based_Alternating_Direction_Methods_and_Connections_to_Split_Bregman","abstract":"Analogous to the connection between Bregman iteration and the method of multipliers that was pointed out in [59], we show that a similar connection can be made between the split Breg-man algorithm [32] and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) of ([29], [31]). Existing convergence theory for ADMM [23] can therefore be used to justify both the alternating step and inexact minimizations used in split Bregman for the cases in which the algorithms are equivalent. Application of these algorithms to different image processing problems is simplified by rewriting these problems in a general form that still includes constrained and unconstrained total variation, (TV), and l 1 minimization as was investigated in [32]. Numerical results for the application to TV-l 1 minimization [12] are presented. We also discuss applications of two related methods, the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) of [56] and the Bregman op-erator splitting algorithm (BOS) of [61], which are sometimes better suited for problems where further decoupling of variables is useful.","authors":["Ernie Esser"],"meta":["January
