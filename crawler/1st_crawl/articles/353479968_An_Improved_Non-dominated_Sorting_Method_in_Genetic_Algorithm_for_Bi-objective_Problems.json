{"id":"353479968_An_Improved_Non-dominated_Sorting_Method_in_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Bi-objective_Problems","abstract":"This paper proposes a new non-dominated-sorting method for non-dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm (NSGA2). This method combines crowding distance and distance-based\nmethods for non-dominated-sorting. The distance-based method identifies concavities on\nthe Pareto Front curve and selects the solutions located at these points. Our goal in this\nmethod is to converge faster and find more optimal solutions in the Genetic Algorithm. The\nNumerical example shows that the results obtained from NSGA2 method with modified\nnon-dominated sorting are better than regular NSGA2.","authors":["Mirpouya Mirmozaffari"],"meta":["January 2021"],"references":["352902154_A_New_Multiobjective_Time-Cost_Trade-Off_for_Scheduling_Maintenance_Problem_in_a_Series-Parallel_System","351374809_A_Modified_Adaptive_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multi-product_Multi-period_Inventory_Routing_Problem","351027126_A_Green_Multi-period_Inventory_Routing_Problem_with_Pickup_and_Split_Delivery_A_Case_Study_in_Flour_Industry","347777604_Integrated_Preventive_Maintenance_Scheduling_Model_with_Redundancy_for_Cutting_Tools_on_a_Single_Machine","347399098_A_Novel_Artificial_Intelligent_Approach_Comparison_of_Machine_learning_Tools_and_Algorithms_Based_on_Optimization_DEA_Malmquist_Productivity_Index_for_Ecoefficiency_Evaluation","346050147_Filtering_in_Image_Processing","353541400_Green_Supply_Chain_Network_Design_with_Emphasis_on_Inventory_Decisions","346050164_A_Comparison_of_Machine_Learning_Clustering_Algorithms_Based_on_the_DEA_Optimization_Approach_for_Pharmaceutical_Companies_in_Developing_Countries","346050162_Eco-efficiency_Evaluation_in_Cement_Industries_DEA_Malmquist_Productivity_Index_Using_Optimization_Models","344333669_Improving_Construction_and_Demolition_Waste_Collection_Service_in_an_Urban_Area_Using_a_Simheuristic_Approach_A_Case_Study_in_Sydney_Australia","343144613_Adaptive_Wavelet_Based_MRI_Brain_Image_De-noising","343030743_Optimized_Wavelet-Based_Satellite_Image_De-Noising_With_Multi-Population_Differential_Evolution-Assisted_Harris_Hawks_Optimization_Algorithm","339439470_MULTIMOORA_Decision_Making_Algorithm_for_Expansion_of_HVDC_and_EHVAC_in_Developing_Countries_A_Case_Study","335827055_Ranking_of_Heart_Hospitals_Using_Cross-Efficiency_and_Two-stage_DEA","339975422_Two-Stage_Stochastic_Choice_Modeling_Approach_for_Electric_Vehicle_Charging_Station_Network_Design_in_Urban_Communities"]}
