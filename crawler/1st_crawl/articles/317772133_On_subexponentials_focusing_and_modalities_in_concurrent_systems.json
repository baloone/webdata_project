{"id":"317772133_On_subexponentials_focusing_and_modalities_in_concurrent_systems","abstract":"In this work we present the focused proof system , which extends intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials with the ability of quantifying over them, hence allowing for the use of an arbitrary number of modalities. We show that the view of subexponentials as specific modalities is general enough to give a modular encoding of different flavors of Concurrent Constraint Programming (CCP), a simple and powerful model of concurrency. More precisely, we encode CCP calculi capturing time, spatial and epistemic behaviors into , thus providing a proof theoretic foundation for those calculi and, at the same time, setting as a general framework for specifying such systems.","authors":["Vivek Nigam","Carlos Olarte","Elaine Pimentel"],"meta":["June 2017Theoretical Computer Science 693(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.06.009"],"references":["317825045_Hybrid_and_Subexponential_Linear_Logics","275366452_Proving_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Correct_Revisited","267465825_Spatial_and_Epistemic_Modalities_in_Constraint-Based_Process_Calculi","263663964_Dynamic_Spaces_in_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","262224960_A_Proof_Theoretic_Study_of_Soft_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","261055520_On_the_Complexity_of_Linear_Authorization_Logics","257552318_Models_and_Emerging_Trends_of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","221443079_A_Proof_Theory_for_Generic_Judgments_An_extended_abstract","221354717_A_Calculus_for_Access_Control_in_Distributed_Systems","221336446_Algorithmic_specifications_in_linear_logic_with_subexponentials","220997945_Semantic_Foundations_of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220897586_Domains_for_Denotational_Semantics","220531949_A_Framework_for_Proof_Systems","220369893_Specifying_Proof_Systems_in_Linear_Logic_with_Subexponentials","220270768_A_Linear_Logic_of_Authorization_and_Knowledge","220065346_Multiset_Rewriting_and_the_Complexity_of_Bounded_Security_Protocols","47462862_From_Proofs_to_Focused_Proofs_A_Modular_Proof_of_Focalization_in_Linear_Logic","2695021_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","2561833_Temporal_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Denotation_Logic_And_Applications","286754490_A_Hybrid_Linear_Logic_for_Constrained_Transition_Systems","282492191_Subexponential_concurrent_constraint_programming","270956368_Mobile_Ambients","262251627_A_General_Proof_System_for_Modalities_in_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","260805222_A_Framework_for_linear_authorization_logics","223569279_The_Esterel_Synchronous_Programming_Language_Design_Semantics_Implementation","221942985_Linear_Logic","221620657_A_Foundation_for_Higher-order_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","221602769_Soft_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220160770_Timed_Default_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220152470_Focusing_and_Polarization_in_Linear_Intuitionistic_and_Classical_Logics","45923989_Classical_and_Intuitionistic_Subexponential_Logics_Are_Equally_Expressive","37705058_Lectures_on_Linear_Logic","2446720_The_Structure_of_Exponentials_Uncovering_the_Dynamics_of_Linear_Logic_Proofs","2413174_Logic_Programming_with_Focusing_Proofs_in_Linear_Logic","2323472_Linear_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Operational_and_Phase_Semantics"]}
