{"id":"339774310_Optimization_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Coverage_using_the_Bee_Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, a method for optimizing the wireless sensor network coverage was introduced using the bee algorithm. We simulated the proposed method in MATLAB software and compared the obtained results with the genetic algorithm. The results showed that the bee algorithm gives more optimal coverage percentage compared to the genetic algorithm and uses less time to use the system resources and implement the algorithm.","authors":["Ibrahim Osamah","Osamah Ibrahem Khalaf","Ghaida Muttashar Abdulsahib"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Information Science and Engineering 36(2):377-386","DOI:10.6688/JISE.202003_36(2).0015"],"references":["337843486_A_New_Algorithm_on_Application_of_Blockchain_Technology_in_Live_Stream_Video_Transmissions_and_Telecommunications","335790885_IOT_fire_detection_system_using_sensor_with_Arduino","335677277_Frequency_Estimation_by_the_Method_of_Minimum_Mean_Squared_Error_and_P-value_Distributed_in_the_Wireless_Sensor_Network","335313082_An_Overview_on_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_Finding_Optimal_Location_of_Nodes","329016882_A_Modified_Algorithm_for_Improving_Lifetime_in_WSN","329016792_A_modified_algorithm_for_improving_lifetime_in_WSN","328828550_Comparison_and_Evaluation_of_Cloud_Processing_Models_in_Cloud-Based_Networks","26547279_Prediction-based_Dynamic_Energy_Management_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","318932330_Novel_Efficient_Deployment_Schemes_for_Sensor_Coverage_in_Mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","51790611_Ant_colony_optimization-based_feature_selection_method_for_surface_electromyography_signals_classification"]}
