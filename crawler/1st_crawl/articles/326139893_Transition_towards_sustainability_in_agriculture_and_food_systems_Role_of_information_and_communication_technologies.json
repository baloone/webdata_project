{"id":"326139893_Transition_towards_sustainability_in_agriculture_and_food_systems_Role_of_information_and_communication_technologies","abstract":"Food sustainability transitions refer to transformation processes necessary to move towards sustainable food systems. Digitization is one of the most important ongoing transformation processes in global agriculture and food chains. The review paper explores the contribution of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to transition towards sustainability along the food chain (production, processing, distribution, consumption). A particular attention is devoted to precision agriculture as a food production model that integrates many ICTs. ICTs can contribute to agro-food sustainability transition by increasing resource productivity, reducing inefficiencies, decreasing management costs, and improving food chain coordination. The paper also explores some drawbacks of ICTs as well as the factors limiting their uptake in agriculture.","authors":["Hamid El Bilali","Mohammad Sadegh Allahyari"],"meta":["July 2018Information Processing in Agriculture 5(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.inpa.2018.06.006","Project: Sustainability Transitions and Food Security"],"references":["331286361_The_Use_of_Future_Internet_Technologies_in_the_Agriculture_and_Food_Sectors_Integrating_the_Supply_Chain","324992170_Relation_between_innovation_and_sustainability_in_the_agro-food_system","323944394_Investigating_the_role_of_smartness_for_sustainability_insights_from_the_Smart_Grid_domain","323639604_The_role_of_Information_sharing_and_communication_strategies_for_improving_stakeholder_engagement","320342130_Feasibility_of_Using_Mobile_Phones_as_an_Educational_Medium_in_Agricultural_Extension_Services_in_Guilan_Province_Iran","318823695_Precision_Agriculture_Technologies_Positively_Contributing_to_GHG_Emissions_Mitigation_Farm_Productivity_and_Economics","350244919_THE_ROLE_OF_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES_IN_SUSTAINABLE_AGRICULTURE","347648911_ENTERING_AN_ERA_OF_WATER_SCARCITY_THE_CHALLENGES_AHEAD","320239528_The_microlevel_actions_undertaken_by_owner-managers_in_improving_the_sustainability_practices_of_cultural_and_creative_small_and_medium_enterprises_A_United_Kingdom-Italy_comparison","308987163_Sustainable_food_systems_with_ICT"]}
