{"id":"304621137_Expressivity_and_Complexity_of_Dependence_Logic","abstract":"In this article we review recent results on expressivity and complexity of first-order, modal, and propositional dependence logic and some of its variants such as independence and inclusion logic. Dependence logic was introduced by Jouko Väänänen in [56]. On the syntactic side, it extends usual first-order logic by the so-called dependence atoms the meaning of which is that the value of x\nn\nis functionally determined by the values of x\n1, …, x\nn−1. The semantics of dependence logic is defined using sets of assignments, teams, rather than single assignments as in first-order logic. Since the introduction of dependence logic in 2007, the area of team semantics has evolved into a general framework for logics in which various notions of dependence and independence can be formalized and studied. In this paper we mainly consider variants of dependence logic arising by replacing/supplementing dependence atoms with further dependency notions, and we also study propositional and modal variants.","authors":["Arnaud Durand","Juha Kontinen","Heribert Vollmer"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-31803-5_2","In book: Dependence Logic (pp.5-32)"],"references":["275527263_Modal_Inclusion_Logic_Being_Lax_is_Simpler_than_Being_Strict","275364489_Complexity_of_Propositional_Independence_and_Inclusion_Logic","270222525_Propositional_Logics_of_Dependence","267395566_A_Van_Benthem_Theorem_for_Modal_Team_Semantics","267157528_Axiomatizing_Propositional_Dependence_Logics","267157444_Decidable_Fragments_of_Logics_Based_on_Team_Semantics","265973833_Extended_modal_dependence_logic_EMDL","263390385_The_Expressive_Power_of_Modal_Dependence_Logic","263390378_Complexity_of_validity_for_propositional_dependence_logics","261289259_Modal_Independence_Logic","259718367_Hierarchies_in_Inclusion_Logic_with_Lax_Semantics","259718364_Hierarchies_in_independence_and_inclusion_logic_with_strict_semantics","258565600_Dependence_logic_with_a_majority_quantifier","258565498_Hierarchies_in_Independence_Logic","257657048_A_Double_Team_Semantics_for_Generalized_Quantifiers","254919109_Modal_dependence_logic","242608657_Generalized_first-order_spectra_and_polynomial_time_recognizable_sets","235432264_Expressing_Second-Order_Sentences_in_Intuitionistic_Dependence_Logic","232144801_A_Fragment_of_Dependence_Logic_Capturing_Polynomial_Time","230738681_Dependence_and_Independence","226972959_On_Definability_in_Dependence_Logic","226342999_Complexity_of_the_Two-Variable_Fragment_with_Binary-Coded_Counting_Quantifiers","221590198_The_Complexity_of_Relational_Query_Languages_Extended_Abstract","220687918_The_Classical_Decision_Problem","344486660_Modal_Logic","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","282181428_The_expressive_power_of_modal_logic_with_inclusion_atoms","272521170_Capturing_k-ary_Existential_Second_Order_Logic_with_k-ary_Inclusion-Exclusion_Logic","268645841_Logical_systems_containing_only_a_finite_number_of_symbols","266000551_Informational_Independence_as_a_Semantical_Phenomenon","265594839_Complexity_of_two-variable_dependence_logic_and_IF-logic","262273703_Generalized_Quantifiers_in_Dependence_Logic","257145242_Model-Checking_Games_for_Logics_of_Imperfect_Information","254895658_Coherence_and_Computational_Complexity_of_Quantifier-Free_Dependence_Logic_Formulas","243596277_Modal_Logic_and_Classical_Logic","239578559_Turing_AM_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungs_problem_Proc_Lond_Math_Soc_Ser_2_42_230-265","236203348_Inclusion_Logic_and_Fixed_Point_Logic","236203247_Axiomatizing_First-Order_Consequences_in_Independence_Logic","226615343_The_Complexity_of_Poor_Man's_Logic","223123365_Capturing_Complexity_Classes_by_Fragments_of_Second-order_Logic","222681673_Graph_Properties_Checkable_in_Linear_Time_in_the_Number_of_Vertices","222656888_Lower_bounds_for_multiplayer_noncooperative_games_of_incomplete_information","222455546_Finite-Model_Theory_-_A_Personal_Perspective","222451435_Relational_Queries_Computable_in_Polynomial_Time","221666200_Characterizing_Quantifier_Extensions_of_Dependence_Logic","221590201_A_Hierarchy_for_Nondeterministic_Time_Complexity","220800512_Team_Logic_and_Second-Order_Logic","220706044_On_modal_logic_IF_logic_and_IF_modal_logic","220617266_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Provability_in_Systems_of_Modal_Propositional_Logic","220573429_A_Hierarchy_for_Nondeterministic_Time_Complexity","220444491_Team_Logic_and_Second-Order_Logic","51941912_Dependence_Logic_with_a_Majority_Quantifier","220388094_Model-Theoretic_and_Computational_Properties_of_Modal_Dependence_Logic","220316049_A_Note_on_the_Entscheidungsproblem","51910370_Inclusion_and_Exclusion_Dependencies_in_Team_Semantics_On_Some_Logicsof_Imperfect_Information"]}
