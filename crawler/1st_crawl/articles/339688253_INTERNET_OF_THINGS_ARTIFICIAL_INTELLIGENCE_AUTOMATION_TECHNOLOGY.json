Some of the\nactivities computers with artificial intelligence are\ndesigned for include: Speech recognition, Learning,\nPlanning, Problem solving beyond the bound of\npossibilities we are here with AI, this is what we are\ntalking about. The near future is here. Technology; hell\nyeah! Now actually we are learning how to use that,\nhow? Let’s take a look- thinking to store some kind of\ndata, but don’t want any kind of overhead of carrying\nand capacity? Let’s use our self then! Yes, it’s right.\nFrom a latest research from unknown resources merely\nHarvard we’ll now be able to store the data in human\ndna. What we can do with a gram of DNA here we go:\nwe can store approximately 700TB of data, that’s 14k\n50GB of bluray-disks. IF you want to store same\namount of data on a hard disk what it takes Is 151 kilos\nof weight or else 233 3 tb disks, that’s kind of difficult\nto handle , so what else be the solution, DNA or noting.","authors":["Samiksha Sharma","Suvansh Arora","Rimsy Dua","Abhishek Sharma"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":[]}
