{"id":"311600937_Injectivity_in_banach_spaces_and_the_mazur-ulam_theorem_on_isometries","abstract":"A mapping/of an open subset U of a Banach space X into another Banach space Y is said to be (m, A/)-isometric if it is a local homeomorphism for which M D⁺f(x) and m < D⁻f(x) for all x Î U, where D⁺f(x) and D⁻f(x) are, respectively, the upper and lower limits of ú f(y) — f(x)ú /úy — x as y→x. For 0 < p < 1 we find a number m(p) > 1 which has the following property: Let X and Y be Banach spaces and let U be an open convex subset of X containing a ball of radius r and contained in the concentric ball of radius R. Then all (m, M)-isometric mappings of U into Y are injective if M/m < m(r/R). We also derive similar injectivity criteria for a more general class of connected open sets U. The basic tool used is an approximate version of the Mazur-Ulam theorem on the linearity of distance preserving transformations between normed linear spaces.","authors":["Julian Gevirtz"],"meta":["November 1982","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9947-1982-0670934-5"],"references":[]}
