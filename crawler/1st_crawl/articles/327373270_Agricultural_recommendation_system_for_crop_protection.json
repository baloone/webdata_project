{"id":"327373270_Agricultural_recommendation_system_for_crop_protection","abstract":"Pests in crops produce important economic loses all around the world. To deal with them without damaging people or the environment, governments have established strict legislation and norms describing the products and procedures of use. However, since these norms frequently change to reflect scientific and technological advances, it is needed to perform a frequent review of affected norms in order to update pest related information systems. This is not an easy task because they are usually human-oriented, so intensive manual labour is required. To facilitate the use of this information, this work proposes the construction of a recommendation system that facilitates the identification of pests and the selection of suitable treatments. The core of this system is an ontology that models the interactions between crops, pests and treatments.","authors":["Javier Lacasta","Francisco J.
