{"id":"320280619_Decomposing_4-connected_planar_triangulations_into_two_trees_and_one_path","abstract":"Refining a classical proof of Whitney, we show that any $4$-connected planar triangulation can be decomposed into a Hamiltonian path and two trees. Therefore, every $4$-connected planar graph decomposes into three forests, one having maximum degree at most $2$. We use this result to show that any Hamiltonian planar triangulation can be decomposed into two trees and one spanning tree of maximum degree at most $3$. These decompositions improve the result of Gon\\c{c}alves [Covering planar graphs with forests, one having bounded maximum degree. J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B, 100(6):729--739, 2010] that every planar graph can be decomposed into three forests, one of maximum degree at most $4$. We also show that our results are best-possible.","authors":["Kolja Knauer","Torsten Ueckerdt"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 134","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2018.05.006"],"references":["268694967_The_incidence_game_chromatic_number_of_-decomposable_graphs","309281124_Decomposing_a_Graph_into_Forests_The_Nine_Dragon_Tree_Conjecture_is_True","272521375_Decomposition_of_Sparse_Graphs_into_Forests_The_Nine_Dragon_Tree_Conjecture_for_k_le_2","263539288_Decomposition_of_Sparse_Graphs_into_Forests_and_a_Graph_with_Bounded_Degree","230281112_Partitioning_a_Planar_Graph_of_Girth_10_into_a_Forest_and_a_Matching","227724164_Edge-partitions_of_planar_graphs_and_their_game_coloring_numbers","223120730_Decomposing_a_planar_graph_with_girth_9_into_a_forest_and_a_matching","220223598_Floorplanning_by_Graph_Dualization_L-shaped_Modules","220194035_Decomposing_a_planar_graph_with_girth_8_into_a_forest_and_a_matching","220187017_Decomposition_of_sparse_graphs_with_application_to_game_coloring_number"]}
