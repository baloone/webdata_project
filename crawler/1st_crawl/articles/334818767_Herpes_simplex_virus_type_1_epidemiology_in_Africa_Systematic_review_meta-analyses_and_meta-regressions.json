Findings were reported following the PRISMA guidelines. Research questions were addressed using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions.\n\nResults: \nForty-three overall (and 69 stratified) HSV-1 seroprevalence measures, and 18 and eight proportions of HSV-1 viral detection in genital ulcer disease (GUD) and in genital herpes, respectively, were extracted from 37 reports. Pooled mean seroprevalence was 67.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.7-78.5%) in children, and 96.2% (95% CI: 95.0-97.3%) in adults. Across age groups, pooled mean was 44.4% (95% CI: 29.9-59.3%) in â‰¤5 years-old, 85.6% (95% CI: 81.0-89.6%) in 6-15 years-old, 93.3% (95% CI: 89.2-96.6%) in 16-25 years-old, and 93.8% (95% CI: 84.6-99.4%) in >25 years-old. Age explained 78.8% of seroprevalence variation. Pooled mean proportion of HSV-1 detection was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.0-1.5%) in GUD, and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.0-4.0%) in genital herpes.\n\nConclusions: \nHSV-1 is universally prevalent in Africa, at higher levels than other regions, with no evidence for declines in seroprevalence in recent decades. Nearly every person acquires the infection in childhood through oral-to-oral transmission, before sexual debut. Sexual oral-to-genital and genital-to-genital transmission appear very limited.","authors":["Manale Harfouche","Hiam Chemaitelly","Laith J Abu-Raddad"],"meta":["July 2019The Journal of infection 79(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.jinf.2019.07.012"],"references":["333974082_HIV_epidemiology_among_female_sex_workers_and_their_clients_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa_systematic_review_meta-analyses_and_meta-regressions","333657417_Characterizing_herpes_simplex_virus_type_1_and_type_2_seroprevalence_declines_and_epidemiological_association_in_the_United_States","332587049_Herpes_simplex_virus_type_1_epidemiology_in_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean_Systematic_review_and_meta-analytics","331649399_Characterizing_the_transitioning_epidemiology_of_herpes_simplex_virus_type_1_in_the_USA_Model-based_predictions","330852475_Herpes_simplex_virus_type_1_epidemiology_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa_systematic_review_meta-analyses_and_meta-regressions","326491417_The_Epidemiology_of_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_Type_1_in_Asia_Systematic_Review_Meta-analyses_and_Meta-regressions","324225745_Trends_in_the_relative_prevalence_of_genital_ulcer_disease_pathogens_and_association_with_HIV_infection_in_Johannesburg_South_Africa_2007-2015","319596381_The_Etiology_of_Genital_Ulcer_Disease_and_Coinfections_With_Chlamydia_trachomatis_and_Neisseria_Gonorrhoeae_in_Zimbabwe_Results_From_the_Zimbabwe_STI_Etiology_Study","320596143_Introduction_to_meta-analysis","317788344_Modelling_efforts_needed_to_advance_herpes_simplex_virus_HSV_vaccine_development_Key_findings_from_the_World_Health_Organization_Consultation_on_HSV_Vaccine_Impact_Modelling"]}
