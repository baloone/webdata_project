{"id":"314092594_Subquadratic_Algorithms_for_the_Diameter_and_the_Sum_of_Pairwise_Distances_in_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"We show how to compute for $n$-vertex planar graphs in $O(n^{11/6}{\\rm polylog}(n))$ expected time the diameter and the sum of the pairwise distances. The algorithms work for directed graphs with real weights and no negative cycles. In $O(n^{15/8}{\\rm polylog}(n))$ expected time we can also compute the number of pairs of vertices at distance smaller than a given threshold. These are the first algorithms for these problems using time $O(n^c)$ for some constant $c<2$, even when restricted to undirected, unweighted planar graphs.","authors":["Sergio Cabello"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["221661384_Multiple-Source_Shortest_Paths_in_Embedded_Graphs","221590702_Homology_Flows_Cohomology_Cuts","51950973_Linear-Space_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Planar_Bounded-Genus_andMinor-Free_Graphs","45914004_Determining_Edge_Expansion_and_Other_Connectivity_Measures_of_Graphs_of_Bounded_Genus","333911173_Almost_optimal_distance_oracles_for_planar_graphs","318494291_Concrete_and_Abstract_Voronoi_Diagrams","312252459_Subquadratic_Algorithms_for_the_Diameter_and_the_Sum_of_Pairwise_Distances_in_Planar_Graphs","285511207_Handbook_of_discrete_and_computational_geometry","277895669_Approximation_and_Fixed_Parameter_Subquadratic_Algorithms_for_Radius_and_Diameter","275364766_Optimal_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Planar_Facility_Location_Problems_Using_Voronoi_Diagrams","262402079_Shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs_with_real_lengths_in_On_log_2_n_log_log_n_time","262281728_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_the_diameter_and_radius_of_sparse_graphs","261369273_Faster_Shortest_Paths_in_Dense_Distance_Graphs_with_Applications","241298998_Generalized_Nested_Dissection","237508133_Wiener_Index_Diameter_and_Stretch_Factor_of_a_Weighted_Planar_Graph_in_Subquadratic_Time","234800437_Shortest_Paths_in_Directed_Planar_Graphs_with_Negative_Lengths_A_Linear-Space_On_log2_n-Time_Algorithm","230648884_Structured_Recursive_Separator_Decompositions_for_Planar_Graphs_in_Linear_Time","225509231_A_Fully_Dynamic_Approximation_Scheme_for_Shortest_Paths_in_Planar_Graphs","223693493_Planar_Separators_and_Parallel_Polygon_Triangulation","222702784_Planar_graphs_negative_weight_edges_shortest_paths_and_near_linear_time","222646777_Algorithms_for_graphs_of_bounded_treewidth_via_orthogonal_range_searching","222566094_Lowest_common_ancestors_in_trees_and_directed_acyclic_graphs","221591251_Improved_algorithms_for_min_cut_and_max_flow_in_undirected_planar_graphs","221591061_Sublinear_Time_Algorithms_for_Metric_Space_Problems","221590926_Finding_minimum-quotient_cuts_in_planar_graphs","221444095_A_New_Succinct_Representation_of_RMQ-Information_and_Improvements_in_the_Enhanced_Suffix_Array","220780293_Many_distances_in_planar_graphs","220779823_Multiple-source_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","220770511_Shortest_Cut_Graph_of_a_Surface_with_Prescribed_Vertex_Set","220617608_Fast_Algorithms_for_Shortest_Paths_in_Planar_Graphs_with_Applications","220556536_Abstract_Voronoi_Diagrams_Revisited","220432427_Planar_Graph_Decomposition_and_All_Pairs_Shortest_Paths","220390500_Shortest_paths_in_directed_planar_graphs_with_negative_lengths_A_linear-space","220223589_Many_Distances_in_Planar_Graphs","51969625_Approximating_the_Diameter_of_Planar_Graphs_in_Near_Linear_Time","47842090_Randomized_Incremental_Construction_of_Abstract_Voronoi_Diagrams","47822091_Exact_Distance_Oracles_for_Planar_Graphs","46620331_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_and_Applications","30815232_Approximating_Average_Parameters_of_Graphs","3921137_Compact_oracles_for_reachability_and_approximate_distances_in_planar_digraphs","3921129_Planar_graphs_negative_weight_edges_shortest_paths_and_near_linear_time","1956055_Dynamic_Generators_of_Topologically_Embedded_Graphs"]}
