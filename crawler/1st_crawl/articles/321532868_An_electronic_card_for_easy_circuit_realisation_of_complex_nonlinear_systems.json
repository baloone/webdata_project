{"id":"321532868_An_electronic_card_for_easy_circuit_realisation_of_complex_nonlinear_systems","abstract":"The studies on nonlinear systems that show complex dynamic behavior and their applications have been increased in the recent years. Some of these studies are modeling of the complex chaotic systems. The modeling of chaotic equations is needed by the researches who work in especially electronics and computer sciences. In this study, an electronic circuit is designed to make easier the realization of chaotic circuits for which the realization of them is problematic. With the designed electronic circuit, the many continuous chaotic circuits with or without initial condition can be fast realized with ease. Moreover, the designed electronic card for the chaotic circuits has the advantage in terms of complexity, workload, cost and time. Especially, it will offer many advantage on education for undergraduate and post graduate students and also for researchers working in this field.","authors":["Akif Akgul"],"meta":["December 2017ELECTRONICS WORLD 124(1978):29","Project: Chaos based engineering applications (Chaotic circuits,  cryptology, steganography, PRNGs and TRNGs, microcomputers, FPGA based applications, etc.)"],"references":[]}
