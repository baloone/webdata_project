Given a background linear shear flow, a KdV equation can be found with coefficients depending on the strength of the shear flow. The derivation also shows that the velocity field under the wave can be constructed approximately from the free surface excursion.\nA convective breaking criterion is put forward and used to detect incipient wave breaking in periodic traveling waves and solitary waves. It is shown that for both the solitary wave and the cnoidal waves, there are limiting waveheights where the horizontal component of the particle velocity equals the phase velocity of the wave. It is found that the strength of the vorticity has a considerable influence on the critical waveheight.","authors":["Amutha Senthilkumar","Henrik Kalisch"],"meta":["December 2017European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids 73","DOI:10.1016/j.euromechflu.2017.12.006"],"references":["314655145_Vortex_dynamics_in_nonlinear_free_surface_flows"]}
