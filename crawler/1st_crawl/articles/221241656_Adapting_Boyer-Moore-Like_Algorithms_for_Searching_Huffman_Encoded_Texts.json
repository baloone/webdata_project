{"id":"221241656_Adapting_Boyer-Moore-Like_Algorithms_for_Searching_Huffman_Encoded_Texts","abstract":"We propose an efficient approach to the compressed string matching problem on Huffman encoded texts, based on the Boyer-Moore strategy. Once a candidate valid shift has been located, a subsequent verification phase checks whether the shift is codeword aligned by taking advantage of the skeleton tree data structure. Our approach leads to algorithms that exhibit a sublinear behavior on the average, as shown by extensive experimentation.","authors":["Domenico Cantone","Simone Faro","Emanuele Giaquinta"],"meta":["January 2009International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science 23(2):29-39","DOI:10.1142/S0129054112400163","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Prague Stringology Conference 2009, Prague, Czech Republic, August 31 - September 2, 2009"],"references":["262234901_Towards_a_Solution_to_the_Runs_Conjecture","268710088_A_linear_algorithm_for_data_compression","265660083_Free_Differential_Calculus_IV_The_Quotient_Groups_of_the_Lower_Central_Series","263556116_Skeleton_Trees_for_the_Efficient_Decoding_of_Huffman_Encoded_Texts","262370376_Fast_algorithm_for_computing_longest_common_subsequences_of_small_alphabet_size","255574158_Computing_repetitive_structures_in_indeterminate_strings","244446545_Uniqueness_Theorems_for_Periodic_Functions","244394107_New_Lower_Bound_on_the_Number_of_Ternary_Square-Free_Words","243134810_A_simple_proof_that_a_word_of_length_n_has_at_most_distinct_squares","236132175_A_Review_of_SIMD_Multimedia_Extensions_and_their_Usage_in_Scientific_and_Engineering_Applications","234809479_A_new_approach_to_text_searching","235047912_String-Matching_and_Other_Products","234795517_An_Improved_Algorithm_to_Find_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_of_Two_Strings","234791256_Complete_inverted_files_for_efficient_text_retrieval_and_analysis","234777471_Up-Down_Parsing_with_Prefix_Grammars"]}
