{"id":"326328106_Annotating_Bhojpuri_Corpus_using_BIS_Scheme","abstract":"The present paper talks about the application of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) scheme for one of the most widely spoken Indian languages 'Bhojpuri'. Bhojpuri has claimed for its inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, where currently 22 major Indian languages are already enlisted. Recently through Indian government initiatives these scheduled languages have received the attention from Computational aspect, but unfortunately this non-scheduled language still lacks such attention for its development in the field of NLP. The present work is possibly the first of its kind.The BIS tagset is an Indian standard designed for tagging almost all the Indian languages. Annotated corpora in Bhojpuri and the simplified annotation guideline to this tagset will serve as an important tool for such well-known NLP tasks as POS-Tagger, Phrase Chunker, Parser, Structural Transfer, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), etc.","authors":["Srishti Singh","Esha Banerjee"],"meta":["July 2018","Conference: 2nd Workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation (WILDRE-2), Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2014.At: Reykjavik (Iceland)"],"references":["221396190_Annotating_Sanskrit_Corpus_Adapting_IL-POSTS","279478112_The_computational_analysis_of_morphosyntactic_categories_in_Urdu","224890809_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Computational_Linguistics_Oxford_Handbooks_in_Linguistics_S"]}
