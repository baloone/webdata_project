{"id":"311918065_HardwareSoftware_Co-Design_of_an_Accelerator_for_FV_Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme_Using_Karatsuba_Algorithm","abstract":"Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE) schemes allow to carry out operations on data in the cipher domain. In a cloud computing scenario, personal informations can be processed without compromising their confidentiality. However, due to the size of primitives of SHE, a pure software implementation is time consuming. That is why several alternatives consist on accelerating Homomorphic Encryption on FPGA. Because recent Homomorphic schemes base their arithmetic in a ring of polynomials reduced by an irreducible one, hardware accelerator implements fast polynomial arithmetic with FFT algorithm. However, this approach has several constraints and requires a large amount of hardware resources. In this paper, we use Karatsuba algorithm to accelerate SHE in hardware and we demonstrate that for various sizes and parameters, Karatsuba can be a good alternative to FFT. For a multiplicative depth of 4, our accelerator performs an homomorphic multiplication of Fan-Vercauteren (FV) scheme in 11.9 ms instead of 15.46 ms with other state of the art approaches, with 50% logic savings.","authors":["Vincent Migliore","Maria MÃ©ndez Real","Vianney Lapotre","Arnaud Tisserand"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Computers PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TC.2016.2645204"],"references":["299365697_Flattening_NTRU_for_Evaluation_Key_Free_Homomorphic_Encryption","265571532_Improved_Security_for_a_Ring-Based_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme","234346907_Multiplication_of_Multidigit_Numbers_on_Automata","221348062_Public-Key_Cryptosystems_Based_on_Composite_Degree_Residuosity_Classes","220334118_Fully_homomorphic_SIMD_operations","314703515_NFLlib_NTT-Based_Fast_Lattice_Library","309774041_Faster_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Bootstrapping_in_Less_Than_01_Seconds","305472502_A_Subfield_Lattice_Attack_on_Overstretched_NTRU_Assumptions","300546224_Modular_Hardware_Architecture_for_Somewhat_Homomorphic_Function_Evaluation","300546133_Accelerating_Homomorphic_Evaluation_on_Reconfigurable_Hardware","283893826_SHIELD_Scalable_Homomorphic_Implementation_of_Encrypted_Data-Classifiers","267862690_Somewhat_Practical_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based","267438553_A_comparison_of_the_homomorphic_encryption_schemes_FV_and_YASHE","266717521_Scale-Invariant_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_over_the_Integers","265187089_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_without_Modulus_Switching_from_Classical_GapSVP","262331468_Lattice-based_FHE_as_secure_as_PKE","247878188_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_in_a_Finite_Field","238426205_Generalized_Mersenne_Prime","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220335489_V_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_over_the_Integers","220335147_Implementing_Gentry's_Fully-Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme","220138781_Leveled_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_without_Bootstrapping"]}
