{"id":"237555200_CONFERENCE_STREAM_WORKPLACE_LEARNING_Transfer_between_Learning_and_Practice_The_Use_of_Web-based_Video_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Web-based video is one of the technologies which can support meaningful learning - in addition to practical benefits such as accessibility of practices, flexibility in updating information, and incorporating video into multimedia resources A multiple case study has been set up on the use of video in four competence-based curricula (Italian language, educational consultance, medicines and social dentistry). In these cases, video has been used to analyze of model behaviour, reflect up on practices including teacher feedback and peer feedback, and assess professional competences. Generally, web-based video shows to be effective in supporting teaching and assessment of students: students learn by the analysis of model behaviour, students reflect more and better on their own behaviour, and both teachers and students get a clearer picture of the competencies which have to be assessed.","authors":["Wilfried Admiraal","Judith Janssen","Monique Pijls","Anne-Martine Gielis"],"meta":[],"references":["228871875_Immediate_and_delayed_effects_of_using_a_classroom_case_exemplar_in_teacher_education_The_role_of_presentation_format","226784739_The_role_of_lesson_analysis_in_pre-service_teacher_education_An_empirical_investigation_of_teacher_learning_from_a_virtual_video-based_field_experience","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","313716025_Legitimate_peripheral_participation_in_communities_of_practice","292429173_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation_in_Communities_of_Practice","263538365_Enhancing_the_teaching_experience_of_pre-service_teachers_through_the_use_of_videos_in_web-based_computer-mediated_communication_CMC","240512810_Sink_or_swim_Taking_advantage_of_developments_in_video_streaming","239060458_Learning_with_Technology_A_Constructivist_Perspective","229068230_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_mental_processes","227535246_An_instructional_strategy_framework_for_online_learning_environments"]}
