{"id":"262029956_Subspace_Polynomials_and_Cyclic_Subspace_Codes","abstract":"Subspace codes have received an increasing interest recently, due to their\napplication in error-correction for random network coding. In particular,\ncyclic subspace codes are possible candidates for large codes with efficient\nencoding and decoding algorithms. In this paper we consider such cyclic codes.\nWe provide constructions of optimal cyclic codes for which their codewords do\nnot have full length orbits. We further introduce a new way to represent\nsubspace codes by a class of polynomials called subspace polynomials. We\npresent some constructions of such codes which are cyclic and analyze their\nparameters.","authors":["Eli Ben-sasson","Tuvi Etzion","Ariel Gabizon","Netanel Raviv"],"meta":["April 2014IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62(3)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2520479","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260557412_Cyclic_Orbit_Codes_and_Stabilizer_Subfields","259692531_Construction_of_Large_Constant_Dimension_Codes_with_a_Prescribed_Minimum_Distance","257818523_On_Perfect_Codes_and_Related_Concepts","324405509_Concrete_Mathematics_a_Foundation_for_Computer_Science","274228936_Finite_Fields","265451880_Endliche_Gruppen_I","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","246995074_On_a_Special_Class_of_Polynomials","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","243094156_On_the_Zeros_of_the_Askey-Wilson_Polynomials_with_Applications_to_Coding_Theory"]}
