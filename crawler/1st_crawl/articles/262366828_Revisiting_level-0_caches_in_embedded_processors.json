{"id":"262366828_Revisiting_level-0_caches_in_embedded_processors","abstract":"Level-0 (L0) caches have been proposed in the past as an inexpensive way to improve performance and reduce energy consumption in resource-constrained embedded processors. This paper proposes new L0 data cache organizations using the assumption that an L0 hit/miss determination can be completed prior to the L1 access. This is a realistic assumption for very small L0 caches that can nevertheless deliver significant miss rate and/or energy reduction. The key issue for such caches is how and when to move data between the L0 and L1 caches. The first new cache, a flow cache, targets a conflict miss reduction in a direct-mapped L1 cache. It offers a simpler hardware design and uses on average 10% less dynamic energy than the victim cache with nearly identical performance. The second new cache, a hit cache, reduces the dynamic energy consumption in a set-associative L1 cache by 30% without impacting performance. A variant of this policy reduces the dynamic energy consumption by up to 50%, with 5% performance degradation.","authors":["Nam Duong","Taesu Kim","Dali Zhao","Alexander V.
