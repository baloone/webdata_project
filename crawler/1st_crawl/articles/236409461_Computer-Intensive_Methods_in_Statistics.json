{"id":"236409461_Computer-Intensive_Methods_in_Statistics","abstract":"In the past few years there has been a surge in the development of new statistical theories and methods that take advantage of the high speed digital computer. The payoff for such intensive computation methods is freedom from two limiting factors that have dominated statistical theory since its beginning: the assumption that the data conform to a bell-shaped curve and the need to focus on statistical measures whose theoretical properties can be analyzed mathematically. The new methods free the statistician to attack more complicated problems, exploiting a wider array of statistical tools. The bootstrap method is examined and evaluated as an example of this new generation of statistical tools.","authors":["Persi Diaconis","Bradley Efron"],"meta":["June 1983Scientific American 248(5)","DOI:10.1038/scientificamerican0583-116"],"references":[]}
