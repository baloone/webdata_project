{"id":"338283034_Analysis_the_Effect_of_Different_Factors_on_the_Development_of_Mobile_Learning_Applications_at_Different_Stages_of_Usage","abstract":"For the development effective and successful mobile learning applications, it is important to understand the users’ requirements in different stages of usage. In this paper, we developed a new model to study the effect of different factors on mobile learning applications development at the three main stages of usage (static stage, interaction stage and transaction stage). The results of this study showed that each stage of the three stages, static, interaction, and transaction has different requirements in terms of system compatibility, security, information quality, awareness, perceived functional benefit, self-efficacy, perceived image, perceived uncertainty, availability of resources, and perceived trust. In addition, the results demonstrated that the requirements and perceptions of users towards the adoption and use of mobile learning application in the three stages significantly differ. The novelty of this research will be an added value to the body of knowledge and its implications will be vital for researchers and designers who are developing mobile learning applications.","authors":["Mohammed Amin Almaiah د. محمد أمين المعايعة","Mahdi M Alamri","Waleed Mugahed Al-Rahmi"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963333","Project: Green Skills in Environmental Sustainability"],"references":["337684213_Applying_the_UTAUT_Model_to_Explain_the_Students'_Acceptance_of_Mobile_Learning_System_in_Higher_Education","337578601_Analysis_of_the_Effect_of_Course_Design_Course_Content_Support_Course_Assessment_and_Instructor_Characteristics_on_the_Actual_Use_of_E-Learning_System","333244723_Exploring_the_unknown_The_effect_of_resistance_to_change_and_attachment_on_mobile_adoption_among_secondary_pre-service_teachers","331590446_What_are_user_requirements_Developing_an_ISO_standard","330450898_A_new_integrated_model_to_explore_factors_that_influence_adoption_of_mobile_learning_in_higher_education_An_empirical_investigation","329211127_Analysis_of_the_essential_factors_affecting_of_intention_to_use_of_mobile_learning_applications_A_comparison_between_universities_adopters_and_non-adopters","327673054_Examination_of_factors_influencing_the_use_of_mobile_learning_system_An_empirical_study","329256675_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error_Algebra_and_Statistics","328125104_Essential_Factors_for_the_Application_of_Education_Information_System_Using_Mobile_Learning_A_case_study_of_students_of_the_university_of_technology","327969237_Social_Individual_Technological_and_Pedagogical_Factors_Influencing_Mobile_Learning_Acceptance_in_Higher_Education_A_Case_from_Iran"]}
