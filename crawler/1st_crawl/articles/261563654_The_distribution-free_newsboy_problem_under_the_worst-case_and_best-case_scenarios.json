{"id":"261563654_The_distribution-free_newsboy_problem_under_the_worst-case_and_best-case_scenarios","abstract":"New theoretical foundations for analyzing the newsboy problem under incomplete information about the probability distribution of random demand are presented. Firstly, we reveal that the distribution-free newsboy problem under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios actually reduces to the standard newsboy problem with demand distributions that bound the allowable distributions in the sense of increasing concave order. Secondly, we provide a theoretical tool for seeking the best-case and worst-case order quantities when merely the support and the first k moments of the demand are known. Using this tool we derive closed form formulas for such quantities in the case of known support, mean and variance, i.e. k = 2. Consequently, we generalize all results presented so far in literature for the worst-case and best-case scenarios, and present some new ones. Extensions of our findings to the cases of the known mode of a unimodal demand distribution, the known median, and to other stochastic inventory problems are indicated.","authors":["Jerzy Kamburowski"],"meta":["August 2014European Journal of Operational Research 237(1):106â€“112","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2014.01.066"],"references":["227447439_An_Adaptive_Distribution-Free_Algorithm_for_the_Newsvendor_Problem_with_Censored_Demands_with_Applications_to_Inventory_and_Distribution","225488356_A_Note_on_Minimax_Mixture_of_Distributions_Free_Procedure_for_Inventory_Model_with_Variable_Lead_Time","220243889_Regret_in_the_Newsvendor_Model_with_Partial_Information","2403471_Minimax_Analysis_for_Finite_Horizon_Inventory_Models","312620859_A_min-max_solution_of_an_inventory_problem_studies_in_the_mathematical_theory_of_inventory_and_production","285501832_PERT_networks_under_incomplete_probabilistic_information","285023106_A_minimax_distribution_free_procedure_for_an_integrated_inventory_model_with_defective_goods_and_stochastic_lead_time_demand","277460538_A_minimax_distribution-free_procedure_for_a_newsvendor_problem_with_free_shipping","273858092_The_risk-averse_newsvendor_problem_with_random_capacity","267654167_Methods_of_operations_research_With_an_introduction_to_the_dover_edition_by_Saul_I_Gass_Reprint_of_the_1951_revised_ed","265581627_Note_on_stochastic_inventory_models_with_service_level_constraint","265464069_A_Better_Bound_on_the_Variance","265369222_Optimal_Inventory_Policy","264960784_Comparison_Methods_for_Stochastic_Models_and_Risks","248719022_Foundation_of_Stochastic_Inventory_Theory","247839836_The_Distribution_Free_Newsboy_Problem_Review_and_Extensions","242359632_Tchebycheff_Systems_With_Applications_in_Analysis_and_Statistics","228142594_A_Maximum_Entropy_Approach_to_the_Newsvendor_Problem_with_Partial_Information","227414955_The_newsvendor_problem_review_and_directions_for_future_research_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_213_361-374","222530177_The_distribution-free_newsboy_problem_Extensions_to_the_shortage_penalty_case","222493367_The_single-period_news-vendor_problem_Literature_review_and_suggestions_for_future_research","220243660_Expected_Value_of_Distribution_Information_for_the_Newsvendor_Problem","23984390_Would_a_risk-averse_newsvendor_order_less_at_a_higher_selling_price"]}
