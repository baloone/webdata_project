{"id":"326423572_If_Art_Education_Then_Critical_Digital_Making_Computational_Thinking_and_Creative_Code","abstract":"Computer code and programmable objects are a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives. Over the past 25 years critical engagement with digital media has become a part of the art education curriculum. However, involving art students in utilizing processing agents as part of studio practice by learning how to code programming languages is a rare occurrence. This article advocates for computational thinking as an urgent need within art education to prepare students to utilize digital innovations and create code-based artworks. By reviewing the constructionist origins of computational thinking for art educational purposes, we posit that creative code can benefit studio art practice while making broader contributions to conceptions of computational thinking across disciplines. We emphasize three concepts to engage in critical digital making by recognizing code as critical text, code as open or proprietary, and code as digital material to be performed and acted upon.","authors":["Aaron Knochel","Ryan Guillard-Patton"],"meta":["October 2015Studies in Art Education 57(1):21-38","DOI:10.1080/00393541.2015.11666280"],"references":["324063175_Performing_Resistance","274463201_Inventively_Linking_Teaching_and_Learning_with_Computer_Hypertext","274309848_Computational_Thinking","265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","262142960_Media_Arts_Arts_Education_for_a_Digital_Age","259777881_Madonna_and_Hypertext_Liberatory_Learning_in_Art_Education","259747807_Assembling_Visuality_Social_Media_Everyday_Imaging_and_Critical_Thinking_in_Digital_Visual_Culture","255627539_Critical_Thinking_in_and_through_Interactive_Computer_Hypertext_and_Art_Education","249913508_Toward_Critical_Media_Literacy_Core_concepts_debates_organizations_and_policy","246829736_Minds_in_Play_Computer_Game_Design_As_A_Context_for_Children's_Learning","234626866_Postmodern_Principles_In_Search_of_a_21st_Century_Art_Education","228625777_Creative_coding_Programming_for_personal_expression","355145114_Software_Takes_Command","351855540_The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Its_Technological_Reproducibility_and_Other_Writings_on_Media","349810224_Gamer_Theory","347031565_Art_Historical_Appropriation_in_a_Visual_Culture-Based_Art_Education","345769402_Learning_and_Teaching_Art_through_Social_Media","345669928_Principles_of_Possibility_Considerations_for_a_21st-Century_Art_Culture_Curriculum","331009331_FormCode_in_Design_Art_and_Architecture","329648053_Protocol_How_Control_Exists_after_Decentralization","325188667_What_is_Web_20_and_How_Can_it_Further_Art_Education","324064433_The_Monster_and_LoverGirl_Mapping_Complex_Relations_in_Preschool_Children's_Digital_Video_Productions","324064431_Netart_and_Netpedagogy_Introducing_Internet_Art_to_the_Digital_Art_Curriculum","324062647_Pixellated_Play_Practical_and_Theoretical_Issues_Regarding_Videogames_in_Art_Education","305389454_Institutional_Ecology_'Translations'_and_Boundary_Objects_Amateurs_and_Professionals_in_Berkeley's_Museum_of_Vertebrate_Zoology","303990165_Unit_Operations_An_Approach_to_Videogame_Criticism","301801059_Games_as_an_Artistic_Medium_Investigating_Complexity_Thinking_in_Game-Based_Art_Pedagogy","283215024_Remix_Theory_The_Aesthetics_of_Sampling","281100437_Studio_Thinking_2_The_real_benefits_of_visual_arts_education","273947142_Persuasive_Games_The_Expressive_Power_of_Video_Games","273946748_Gaming_Essays_on_Algorithmic_Culture","271802449_Art_Education_and_Computing_Building_a_Perspective","270155186_Teaching_Youth_Media_A_Critical_Guide_to_Literacy_Video_Production_and_Social_Change","263568057_Remix_Making_Art_and_Commerce_Thrive_in_a_Hybrid_Economy","262260676_Soft_Circuits_Crafting_e-Fashion_with_DIY_Electronics","262260575_Short_Circuits_Crafting_e-Puppets_with_DIY_Electronics","262008066_Institutional_Ecology_Translations'_and_Boundary_Objects_Amateurs_and_Professionals_in_Berkeley's_Museum_of_Vertebrate_Zoology_1907-39","261821380_Netart_and_Netpedagogy_Introducing_Internet_Art_to_the_Digital_Art_Curriculum","258122990_The_Remixing_Dilemma_The_Trade-Off_Between_Generativity_and_Originality","257946731_Why_Should_Computational_Work_and_Its_Aesthetics_Be_Taught_in_the_Art_Classroom","247927937_The_Mangle_of_Practice","240730064_Rigorous_Interdisciplinary_PedagogyFive_Years_of_ACE","237012208_The_Computer_Clubhouse_Constructionism_and_creativity_in_youth_communities","234790602_Postmodern_Currents_Art_and_Artists_in_the_Age_of_Electronic_Media","234744660_Interfacing_Hypermedia_and_the_Internet_with_Critical_Inquiry_in_the_Arts_Preservice_Training","234659591_Seven_Principles_for_Visual_Culture_Education","232842533_Protocol_How_Control_Exists_after_Decentralization","229068249_Biology_and_knowledge_An_essay_on_the_relations_between_organic_regulations_and_cognitive_processes","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","227789359_Envision_and_Observe_Using_the_Studio_Thinking_Framework_for_Learning_and_Teaching_in_Digital_Arts","226972762_Technology_and_institutions_Living_in_a_material_world","221238361_BeeSim_leveraging_wearable_computers_in_participatory_simulations_with_young_children","221033986_Collaboration_Computation_and_Creativity_Media_Arts_Practices_in_Urban_Youth_Cultures","227730131_Code_is_Speech_Legal_Tinkering_Expertise_and_Protest_Among_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_Developers","227036657_An_exploration_in_the_space_of_mathematics_educations"]}
