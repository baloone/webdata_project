{"id":"335003304_On_the_simplicity_of_simple_heuristics","abstract":"Recent evidence suggests that the take-the-best heuristic—flagship of “fast and frugal heuristics” research program—might in fact not be as frugal as tallying, which is considered to be a more complex strategy. Characterizing a simple decision strategy has always seemed straightforward, and the debate around the simplicity of the take-the-best heuristic is mostly concerned with a proper specification of the heuristic. I argue that the predominate conceptions of “simplicity” and “frugality” need to be revised. To this end, a number of recent behavioral and neuroscientific results are discussed. The example of take-the-best heuristic serves as an entry point to a foundational debate on bounded agency. I argue that the fast and frugal heuristics needs to question some of its legacy from the classical AI research. For example, the assumption that the bottleneck of decision-making process is information processing due to its serial nature. These commitments are hard to reconcile with the modern neuroscientific view of a human decision-maker. In addition, I discuss an overlooked source of uncertainty, namely neural noise, and compare a generic heuristic model to a similar neural algorithm.","authors":["Gašper Štukelj"],"meta":["August 2019Adaptive Behavior 28(4):105971231986158","DOI:10.1177/1059712319861589"],"references":["321948719_Heuristics_are_Tools_for_Uncertainty","321764803_Perceptual_decisions_are_biased_by_the_cost_to_act","317040195_A_Survey_of_Neuromorphic_Computing_and_Neural_Networks_in_Hardware","303086805_A_Detailed_Comparison_of_Optimality_and_Simplicity_in_Perceptual_Decision_Making","299491665_Bio-inspired_feedback-circuit_implementation_of_discrete_free_energy_optimizing_winner-take-all_computations","296468448_Economic_irrationality_is_optimal_during_noisy_decision_making","282570417_Comparing_perceptual_and_preferential_decision_making","281778890_Prospective_Optimization_with_Limited_Resources","280220209_Risky_visuomotor_choices_during_rapid_reaching_in_childhood","268877797_Dynamic_Divisive_Normalization_Predicts_Time-Varying_Value_Coding_in_Decision-Related_Circuits","263293055_On_the_Origins_of_Suboptimality_in_Human_Probabilistic_Inference","256764139_Perceptuo-motor_cognitive_and_description-based_decision-making_seem_equally_good","229004695_Deconfounding_Hypothesis_Generation_and_Evaluation_in_Bayesian_Models","221796156_Ubiquitous_Log_Odds_A_Common_Representation_of_Probability_and_Frequency_Distortion_in_Perception_Action_and_Cognition","51472790_Implications_of_Cognitive_Load_for_Hypothesis_Generation_and_Probability_Judgment","51222927_The_Neural_Correlates_of_Subjective_Utility_of_Monetary_Outcome_and_Probability_Weight_in_Economic_and_in_Motor_Decision_under_Risk","49653132_Heuristic_Decision_Making","46169026_The_Robust_Beauty_of_Ordinary_Information","44570612_A_mechanistic_account_of_value_computation_in_the_human_brain","329651461_Circuit_Complexity_and_Neural_Networks","320163866_Cognitive_costs_of_decision-making_strategies_A_resource_demand_decomposition_with_a_cognitive_architecture","316210918_Motor_Heuristics_and_Embodied_Choices_How_to_Choose_and_Act","313819903_A_distributed_hierarchical_and_recurrent_framework_for_reward-based_choice","312102163_Perceptual_Decision_Making_in_Rodents_Monkeys_and_Humans","303463767_Homo_Ignorans_Deliberately_Choosing_Not_to_Know","301945782_Selective_alteration_of_human_value_decisions_with_medial_frontal_tDCS_is_predicted_by_changes_in_attractor_dynamics","285393590_The_Central_Role_of_Heuristic_Search_in_Cognitive_Computation_Systems","283474226_Motor_Decision-Making","282463814_Adaptive_neural_coding_From_biological_to_behavioral_decision-making","282153578_Neural_Signatures_of_Controlled_and_Automatic_Retrieval_Processes_in_Memory-based_Decision-making","277934131_Building_the_Theory_of_Ecological_Rationality","277018468_Heuristics_History_of","270820927_Efficient_Cognition_Through_Limited_Search","269416409_Do_humans_make_good_decisions","265909346_What_is_adaptive_about_decision_making_A_parallel_constraint_satisfaction_account","262811876_Reward_Value_Comparison_via_Mutual_Inhibition_in_Ventromedial_Prefrontal_Cortex","262191775_Neural_Oscillations_and_Synchronization_Differentially_Support_Evidence_Accumulation_in_Perceptual_and_Value-Based_Decision_Making","259807402_Single-process_versus_multiple-strategy_models_of_decision_making_Evidence_from_an_information_intrusion_paradigm","259319927_People_are_better_at_Maximizing_Expected_Gain_in_a_Manual_Aiming_Task_with_Rapidly_Changing_Probabilities_than_with_Rapidly_Changing_Payoffs","238673233_Human_problem_solving_The_state_of_the_theory_in_1970","227531519_Homo_Heuristicus_Why_Biased_Minds_Make_Better_Inferences","227174028_A_mechanism_for_value-guided_choice_based_on_the_extinction-inhibition_balance_in_prefrontal_cortex","225342423_How_far_can_rationality_be_naturalized","222446013_A_Componential_Analysis_of_Cognitive_Effort_in_Choice","221880657_Decisions_beyond_boundaries_When_more_information_is_pocessed_faster_than_less","221349827_The_Complexity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220688436_The_Complexity_of_Boolean_Functions","220427542_Computer_Science_as_Empirical_Inquiry_Symbols_and_Search","200086088_How_Can_the_Human_Mind_Occur_in_the_Physical_Universe","51822265_Normalization_as_a_canonical_neural_computation_Nat","21453355_How_might_the_motor_cortex_individuate_movements_Trends_Neurosci","6781417_The_physics_of_optimal_decision_making_A_formal_analysis_of_models_of_performance_in_two-alternative_forced-choice_tasks","4729526_Maps_of_Bounded_Rationality_Psychology_for_Behavioral_Economics"]}
