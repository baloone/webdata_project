{"id":"335196411_iHealthcare_Predictive_Model_Analysis_Concerning_Big_Data_Applications_for_Interactive_Healthcare_Systems","abstract":"Recently, the healthcare industry has caught the attention of researchers due to a need to develop a smart and interactive system for effective and efficient treatment facilities. The healthcare system consists of massive biological data (unstructured or semi-structured) which needs to be analyzed and processed for early disease detection. In this paper, we have designed a piece of healthcare technology which can deal with a patientâ€™s past and present medical data including symptoms of a disease, emotional data, and genetic data. We have designed a probabilistic data acquisition scheme to analyze the medical data. This model contains a data warehouse with a two-way interaction between high-performance computing and cloud synchronization. Finally, we present a prediction scheme that is performed in the cloud server to predict disease in a patient. To complete this task, we used Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), C5.0, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks for prediction analysis, and made a comparison between these algorithms.","authors":["Md.
