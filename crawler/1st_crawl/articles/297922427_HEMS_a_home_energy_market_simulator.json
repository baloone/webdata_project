{"id":"297922427_HEMS_a_home_energy_market_simulator","abstract":"Stability issues in the electric power grid originate from the rising of renewable energy generation and the increasing number of electric vehicles. The uncertainty and the distributed nature of generation and consumption demand for optimal allocation of energy resources, which, in the absence of sufficient control reserve for power generation, can be achieved using demand-response. A price signal can be exploited to reflect the availability of energy. In this paper, market-based energy allocation solutions for small energy grids are discussed and implemented in a simulator, which is released for open use. Artificial neural network controllers for energy prosumers can be designed to minimize individual and overall running costs. This enables a better use of local energy production from renewable sources, while considering residentsâ€™ necessities to minimize discomfort.","authors":["Andrea Monacchi","Sergii Zhevzhyk","Wilfried Elmenreich"],"meta":["November 2014Computer Science - Research and Development 31(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00450-014-0291-7"],"references":["263091686_Integration_of_Legacy_Appliances_into_Home_Energy_Management_Systems","262302322_GREEND_An_energy_consumption_dataset_of_households_in_Italy_and_Austria","261269217_Dynamic_pricing_by_scalable_energy_management_systems_-_Field_experiences_and_simulation_results_using_PowerMatcher","261073749_DRSim_A_cyber_physical_simulator_for_Demand_Response_systems","255485542_Strategies_for_Domestic_Energy_Conservation_in_Carinthia_and_Friuli-Venezia_Giulia","254042761_An_Energy_Market_for_Trading_Electricity_in_Smart_Grid_Neighbourhoods","230855404_FREVO_A_Tool_for_Evolving_and_Evaluating_Self-organizing_Systems","225150092_Auctions_Evolution_and_Multi-agent_Learning","224243498_Demand_Side_Management_Demand_Response_Intelligent_Energy_Systems_and_Smart_Loads","221035960_Self-Organizing_Networked_Systems_for_Technical_Applications_A_Discussion_on_Open_Issues","220565975_Auctions_and_bidding_A_guide_for_computer_scientists","216300585_Introduction_To_Evolutionary_Computing","44849944_Evolving_Neural_Network_Controllers_for_a_Team_of_Self-Organizing_Robots","24106520_An_Experimental_Study_of_Competitive_Market_Behavior","2454264_Power_Load_Management_as_a_Computational_Market","2330445_On_the_Behavioral_Foundations_of_the_Law_of_Supply_and_Demand_Human_Convergence_and_Robot_Randomness","271458031_The_microgrid_simulation_tool_RAPSim_Description_and_case_study","262320156_Cooperative_energy_exchange_for_the_efficient_use_of_energy_and_resources_in_remote_communities","239937849_Market-Based_Control_A_Paradigm_for_Distributed_Resource_Allocation","41667069_Trading_agents_for_the_smart_electricity_grid","4282985_Market-based_grid_resource_allocation_using_a_stable_continuous_double_auction","4193117_User-Centric_Performance_Analysis_of_Market-Based_Cluster_Batch_Schedulers"]}
