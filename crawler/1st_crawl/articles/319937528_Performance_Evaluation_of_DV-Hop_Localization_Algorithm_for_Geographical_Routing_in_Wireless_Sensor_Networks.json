{"id":"319937528_Performance_Evaluation_of_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_for_Geographical_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Geographic protocols have been recently developed for data routing in wireless ad hoc networks. These protocols are based on the exact location of each sensor node, by assuming that sensor nodes are equipped with geographic positioning services or localization-based techniques. At each node, the routing decision is based only on the position of the destination node and the position of the forwarding nodeâ€™s neighbors. Location-based techniques, such DV-Hop, have attracted a lot of interest in order to estimate nodes positions. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of DV-Hop localization technique for estimating nodes localization and integrate it within the greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol. Simulations have been conducted to show the effectiveness of using localization-based techniques when integrated into geographical routing protocols for wireless sensor networks.","authors":["Abdelali Hadir","Khalid Zine-dine","M.
