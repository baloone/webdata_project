{"id":"222435991_Oblique_dual_frames_and_shift-invariant_spaces","abstract":"Given a frame for a subspace of a Hilbert space , we consider a class of oblique dual frame sequences. These dual frame sequences are not constrained to lie in . Our main focus is on shift-invariant frame sequences of the form in subspaces of ; for such frame sequences we are able to characterize the set of shift-invariant oblique dual Bessel sequences. Given frame sequences and , we present an easily verifiable condition implying that contains a generator for a shift-invariant dual of ; in particular, the exact statement of this result implies the somewhat surprising fact that there is a unique conventional dual frame that is shift-invariant. As an application of our results we consider frame sequences generated by B-splines, and show how to construct oblique duals with prescribed regularity.","authors":["O Christensen","Yonina Eldar"],"meta":["July 2004Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis 17(1):48-68","DOI:10.1016/j.acha.2003.12.003"],"references":["266237383_Gabor_frames_for_L_2_and_related_spaces","228645404_General_framework_for_consistent_sampling_in_Hilbert_spaces","222253164_Density_of_Gabor_Frames","2625762_Approximation_from_Shift-Invariant_Subspaces_of_L_2_R_d","344896354_Oblique_projections_biorthogonal_Riesz_bases_and_multiwavelets_in_Hilbert_spaces","302510752_Parametric_Optimization_of_Biorthogonal_Wavelets_and_Filterbanks_via_Pseudoframes_for_Subspaces","289684093_Approximation_from_shift-invariant_subspaces_of_Lsb_2bold_Rsp_d","242944448_A_Theory_of_Generalized_Multiresolution_Structure_and_Pseudoframes_of_Translates","241570205_Oblique_projections_biorthogonal_riesz_bases_and_multiwavelets_in_hilbert_spaces","238866011_On_general_frame_decompositions","230801964_Perturbation_Theory_of_Linear_Operators","229326833_Pseudo-Duals_of_Frames_with_Applications","226022537_Sampling_Without_Input_Constraints_Consistent_Reconstruction_in_Arbitrary_Spaces","225670721_Sampling_with_Arbitrary_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_Spaces_and_Oblique_Dual_Frame_Vectors","223525806_Non-uniform_weighted_average_sampling_and_reconstruction_in_shift-invariant_and_wavelet_spaces","222844510_The_Theory_of_Multiresolution_Analysis_Frames_and_Applications_to_Filter_Banks","200524207_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases","38371575_Perturbation_of_Frames_for_a_Subspace_of_a_Hilbert_Space","2387353_A_Theory_of_Pseudoframes_for_Subspaces_with_Applications"]}
