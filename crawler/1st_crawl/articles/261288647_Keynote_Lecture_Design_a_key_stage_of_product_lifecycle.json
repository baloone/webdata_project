{"id":"261288647_Keynote_Lecture_Design_a_key_stage_of_product_lifecycle","abstract":"Design appears to be a key and critical stage of product lifecycle. Different models have been introduced in previous research to describe the conceptual design process. The RFBS model is one of them extending and deepening the existing FBS models. A previous paper was presenting the model and assuming the possible execution of the process tasks automatically. The present paper provides an overview of the progresses that have been made in this direction during the past years. The model-driven engineering philosophy underlying the RFBS model of knowledge is concretely exemplified in this paper. The implementation through ontology and language such as SysML that was part of the model-driven engineering philosophy is concretely described in this paper in form of computer-aided tools dedicated to the conceptual design stages.","authors":["Alain Bernard","Eric Coatanéa","François Christophe","F.
