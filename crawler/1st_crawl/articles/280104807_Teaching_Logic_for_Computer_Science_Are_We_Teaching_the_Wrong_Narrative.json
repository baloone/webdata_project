{"id":"280104807_Teaching_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Are_We_Teaching_the_Wrong_Narrative","abstract":"In this paper I discuss what, according to my long experience, every computer\nscientist should know from logic. We concentrate on issues of modeling,\ninterpretability and levels of abstraction. We discuss what the minimal toolbox\nof logic tools should look like for a computer scientist who is involved in\ndesigning and analyzing reliable systems. We shall conclude that many classical\ntopics dear to logicians are less important than usually presented, and that\nless-known ideas from logic may be more useful for the working computer\nscientist.","authors":["Johann Makowsky"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324356230_Principles_of_Mathematical_Logic","316824218_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","316823954_A_Course_in_Mathematical_Logic_for_Mathematicians","316224156_Grundzuge_der_theoretischen_Logik","269858082_Naive_Set_Theory","266292150_Grundzuge_der_theoretischen_Logik_6_Aufl","265507021_Logic_of_mathematics_a_modern_course_of_classical_logic","247252058_Principles_of_mathematical_analysis","237106985_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic","224043908_Notes_on_Logic"]}
