{"id":"341153153_Clone_Detection_Techniques_for_JavaScript_and_Language_Independence_Review","abstract":"Code clone detection is an active field of study in computer science. Despite its rich history, it lacks focus on web scripting languages. Due to the expansion of web applications and web development amongst developers of varying education and experience levels, they inevitably resort to cloning throughout the web. The spread of code clones is further increased by websites like StackOverflow and GitHub. In this paper, we will be focusing on clone detection research done to target clones in JavaScript code and discuss its areas of concern. Also, we will summarize language independent research done and possibility of its application on JavaScript and web applications.","authors":["Danyah Alfageh","Hosam Alhakami","Abdullah Baz","Eisa Alanazi"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 11(4)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2020.01104102"],"references":["336031740_A_Survey_on_Clone_Refactoring_and_Tracking","324250822_Benchmarks_for_software_clone_detection_A_ten-year_retrospective","323535753_LICCA_A_tool_for_cross-language_clone_detection","315698515_Language_Independent_Code_Clone_Detection_Approach_Using_JSON_String_Parsing","347578627_Code_duplication_on_stack_overflow","333345773_Multilingual_Detection_of_Code_Clones_Using_ANTLR_Grammar_Definitions","331217264_Toxic_Code_Snippets_on_Stack_Overflow","323566622_CCFinderSW_Clone_Detection_Tool_with_Flexible_Multilingual_Tokenization","319473939_Comparative_study_of_software_clone_detection_techniques","303481069_Towards_Detection_and_Analysis_of_Interlanguage_Clones_for_Multilingual_Web_Applications","261377976_Popularity_Interoperability_and_Impact_of_Programming_Languages_in_100000_Open_Source_Projects","234792131_Detection_of_similarities_in_student_programs_YAP'ing_may_be_preferable_to_Plague'ing","224182598_Language-Independent_Clone_Detection_Applied_to_Plagiarism_Detection","277578258_Development_nature_matters_An_empirical_study_of_code_clones_in_JavaScript_applications","242533336_Syntax_Sensitive_and_Language_Independent_Detection_of_Code_Clones"]}
