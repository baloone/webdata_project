{"id":"328022898_Multilingual_Sentiment_Analysis_A_New_Approach_to_Measuring_Conflict_in_Legislative_Speeches","abstract":"Comparative scholars of legislative politics continue to face the challenge of measuring a key theoretical concept: conflict at the level of legislative bills. We address this challenge with a multilingual sentiment‐based approach and show that such a measure can effectively capture different types of parliamentary conflict. We also demonstrate that an automated translation of the dictionary yields valid results and therefore greatly facilitates comparative work on legislatures. Our applications show that a sentiment approach recovers government‐opposition dynamics in various settings. The use of a simple, translatable sentiment dictionary opens up the possibility of studying legislative conflict in bill debates across languages and countries.","authors":["Sven‐Oliver Proksch","Will Lowe","Jens Wäckerle","Stuart Soroka"],"meta":["October 2018Legislative Studies Quarterly 44(4)","DOI:10.1111/lsq.12218"],"references":["334508031_Reliability_and_Validity_of_the_2002_and_2006_Chapel_Hill_Expert_Surveys_on_Party_Positioning","317741589_The_ParlSpeech_data_set_Annotated_full-text_vectors_of_39_million_plenary_speeches_in_the_key_legislative_chambers_of_seven_European_states","312524063_Explaining_the_salience_of_anti-elitism_and_reducing_political_corruption_for_political_parties_in_Europe_with_the_2014_Chapel_Hill_Expert_Survey_data","279390966_A_Common_Left-Right_Scale_for_Voters_and_Parties_in_Europe","272379273_Computer-Assisted_Text_Analysis_for_Comparative_Politics","264281516_Measuring_Party_Positions_in_Europe_The_Chapel_Hill_Expert_Survey_Trend_File_1999-2010","254746105_WordNet-Affect_an_Affective_Extension_of_WordNet","246699633_Linguistic_inquiry_and_word_count_LIWC","237453008_Computer-Assisted_Topic_Classification_for_Mixed-Methods_Social_Science_Research","236246456_Language_and_Ideology_in_Congress","233777779_Party_Policy_in_Modern_Democracies","232005149_Legislative_Involvement_in_Parliamentary_Systems_Opportunities_Conflict_and_Institutional_Constraints","326126284_The_ParlSpeech_data_set_Annotated_full-text_vectors_of_39_million_plenary_speeches_in_the_key_legislative_chambers_of_seven_European_states","324621854_Verbal_Style_and_the_Presidency_A_Computer-Based_Analysis","324324740_The_Clockwork_Muse_The_Predictability_of_Artistic_Change","322436537_Database_of_parliamentary_speeches_in_Ireland_1919-2013","316018442_Governing_Europe_for_the_people_Citizen_representation_in_European_Union_policy-making","315598691_Committee_Chairs_and_Legislative_Review_in_Parliamentary_Democracies","314517056_The_Government_Agenda_in_Parliamentary_Democracies","306284143_The_General_Inquirer_A_Computer_Approach_to_Content_Analysis","305310369_L'analyse_automatisee_du_ton_mediatique_construction_et_utilisation_de_la_version_francaise_du_Lexicoder_Sentiment_Dictionary","303008418_Measuring_Political_Positions_from_Legislative_Speech","299058890_Coalition_Policymaking_and_Legislative_Review","293643553_A_Dictionary_of_Affect_in_Language_V_What_is_An_Emotion","289284858_Parties_in_Parliament_The_Blurring_of_Opposition","289057500_Parliaments_and_Coalitions_The_Role_of_Legislative_Institutions_in_Multiparty_Governance","287255129_Negativity_in_Democratic_Politics_Causes_and_Consequences","282419170_The_Most_Unkindest_Cuts_Speaker_Selection_and_Expressed_Government_Dissent_during_Economic_Crisis","282022532_The_Politics_of_Parliamentary_Debate_Parties_Rebels_and_Representation","274923983_Romantic_Progression_The_Psychology_of_Literary_History","274812022_Romantic_Progression_The_Psychology_of_Literary_History","273652736_Ideology_Strategy_and_Party_Change_Spatial_Analyses_of_Post-War_Election_Programmes_in_19_Democracies","272933536_Minority_Government_and_Majority_Rule","272926728_Verbal_Style_and_the_Presidency_A_Computer-Based_Analysis","270223293_Government_laws_and_the_opposition_parties'_behaviour_in_parliament","266673257_There's_Basically_Only_One_Way_to_Do_it","262316233_Legislative_Pledges_and_Coalition_Government","260606579_Parties_and_Policymaking_in_Multiparty_Governments_The_Legislative_Median_Ministerial_Autonomy_and_the_Coalition_Compromise","259486122_Horses_and_Hippos_Why_Italian_Government_Bills_Change_in_the_Legislative_Arena_1987-2006","259220685_Institutional_Foundations_of_Legislative_Speech","254959353_Validating_Estimates_of_Latent_Traits_from_Textual_Data_Using_Human_Judgment_as_a_Benchmark","247434270_Roget''s_Thesaurus_of_English_Words_and_Phrases","243763247_The_dictionary_of_affect_in_language","242651144_The_Gatekeeping_Function_Distributions_of_Information_in_Media_and_the_Real_World","239798103_Affective_News_The_Automated_Coding_of_Sentiment_in_Political_Texts","239604183_Affective_Norms_for_English_Words_ANEW_Instruction_Manual_and_Affective_Ratings","233777846_How_to_Scale_Coded_Text_Units_without_Bias_A_Response_to_Gemenis","233777842_Party_Policy_and_Government_Coalitions","233777778_Policy_and_Party_Competition","232476377_The_Clockwork_Muse_The_Predictability_of_Artistic_Change","228889549_Determining_the_sentiment_of_opinions","228728113_Extracting_Policy_Positions_from_Political_Texts_Using_Words_as_Data","231889439_Position_Taking_in_European_Parliament_Speeches","228379274_EuroParl_A_parallel_corpus_for_statistical_machine_translation","228163421_Understanding_Wordscores"]}
