{"id":"324656715_Predicting_Student_Performance_Based_on_Online_Study_Habits_A_Study_of_Blended_Courses","abstract":"Learning Management Systems (LMS), homework platforms, and other online tools have become core components of modern undergraduate courses. These systems provide us with a partial window on students' study habits and their problem-solving behavior in blended courses. Prior research on MOOCs has shown that such online data can be used to inform instructors and to provide automatic guidance to students. However, it is not yet clear that these techniques can be applied to blended courses. In this paper we report on a study of integrated user-system interaction logs from three course offerings in computer science which used four online systems: a standard LMS, a discussion forum, version control, and a homework submission system. We find that the students use these systems in isolation and rarely work across platforms in a single session. We also find that the students' use of the systems can be used to predict their final class performance. This work highlights the potential for automated student guidance and instructor support in blended courses.","authors":["Adithya Sheshadri","Niki Gitinabard","Collin F Lynch","Tiffany Michelle Barnes"],"meta":["April 2018","Conference: Educational Data Mining 2018 (In press)","Project: ModSoc"],"references":["320084023_A_Social_Network_Analysis_on_Blended_Courses","318238884_Can_Typical_Behaviors_Identified_in_MOOCs_be_Discovered_in_Other_Courses","314237144_Mining_Login_Data_for_Actionable_Student_Insight","301887774_Predicting_students'_outcome_by_interaction_monitoring","273974140_Penetrating_the_black_box_of_time-on-task_estimation","265966964_Capturing_attrition_intensifying_structural_traits_from_didactic_interaction_sequences_of_MOOC_learners","258834966_Blended_learning_systems_Definition_current_trends_and_future_directions","236973386_Who_Does_What_in_a_Massive_Open_Online_Course","323328429_Models_for_Early_Identification_of_Struggling_Novice_Programmers","316940202_MOOC_student_dropout_pattern_and_prevention","315469123_Exploring_N-gram_Features_in_Clickstream_Data_for_MOOC_Learning_Achievement_Prediction","304298833_Temporal_Models_for_Predicting_Student_Dropout_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","301409064_Predicting_Attrition_Along_the_Way_The_UIUC_Model","298346148_A_time_series_interaction_analysis_method_for_building_predictive_models_of_learners_using_log_data","298338327_Understanding_MOOC_students_Motivations_and_behaviours_indicative_of_MOOC_completion","291063731_Predicting_MOOC_Dropout_over_Weeks_Using_Machine_Learning_Methods","281610223_On_study_habits_on_an_introductory_course_on_programming","243766442_Errata_Use_of_Ranks_in_One-Criterion_Variance_Analysis","232243251_Multi-instance_Genetic_Programming_for_Predicting_Student_Performance_in_Web_Based_Educational_Environments","229891919_Web_usage_mining_for_predicting_marks_of_students_that_use_Moodle_courses","221995635_Introductory_Statistics_with_R"]}
