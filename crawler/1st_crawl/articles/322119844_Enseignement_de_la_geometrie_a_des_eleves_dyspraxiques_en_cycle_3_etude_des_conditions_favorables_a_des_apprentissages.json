Learning geometry may hence appear to be inaccessible to dyspraxic pupils because their motor manipulation and organizational difficulties lead them to fail in the implementation of their actions. In this paper, we present an analysis framework elaborated to study the process of accessing geometrical concepts through construction with instruments. Thanks to this framework and thanks to a comparison of instrumented constructions in a digital environment and in a paper pencil environment, we highlight obstacles and we establish right conditions that allow dyspraxic pupils to learn geometry.","authors":["Petitfour Edith"],"meta":["January 2017La nouvelle revue - Éducation et société inclusives 78(2):47","DOI:10.3917/nras.078.0047"],"references":[]}
