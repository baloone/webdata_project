{"id":"279968729_Honest_confidence_regions_and_optimality_in_high-dimensional_precision_matrix_estimation","abstract":"We propose methodology for estimation of sparse precision matrices and\nstatistical inference for their low-dimensional parameters in a\nhigh-dimensional setting where the number of parameters $p$ can be much larger\nthan the sample size. We show that the novel estimator achieves minimax rates\nin supremum norm and the low-dimensional components of the estimator have a\nGaussian limiting distribution. These results hold uniformly over the class of\nprecision matrices with row sparsity of small order $\\sqrt{n}/\\log p$ and\nspectrum uniformly bounded, under sub-Gaussian tail assumption on the margins\nof the true underlying distribution. Consequently, our results lead to\nuniformly valid confidence regions for low-dimensional parameters of the\nprecision matrix. Thresholding the estimator leads to variable selection\nwithout imposing irrepresentability conditions. The performance of the method\nis demonstrated in a simulation study.","authors":["Jana Jankov√°","Sara van de Geer"],"meta":["July 2015Test 26(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11749-016-0503-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261253169_A_Novel_Sparse_Group_Gaussian_Graphical_Model_for_Functional_Connectivity_Estimation","256981584_Asymptotic_Normality_and_Optimalities_in_Estimation_of_Large_Gaussian_Graphical_Model","254211576_High-dimensional_covariance_estimation_by_minimizing_-penalized_log-determinant_divergence","236936031_Supplementary_Appendix_for_Inference_on_Treatment_Effects_After_Selection_Amongst_High-Dimensional_Controls","235766066_On_Asymptotically_Optimal_Confidence_Regions_and_Tests_for_High-Dimensional_Models","221663813_Sparse_Matrix_Inversion_with_Scaled_Lasso","51957722_The_Graphical_Lasso_New_Insights_and_Alternatives","48207040_A_Constrained_L1_Minimization_Approach_to_Sparse_Precision_Matrix_Estimation","46587998_Square-Root_Lasso_Pivotal_Recovery_of_Sparse_Signals_via_ConicProgramming","38348364_Asymptotics_for_LASSO-type_estimators","5769720_Sparse_inverse_covariance_estimation_with_the_graphical_LASSO","5207515_Model_selection_and_estimation_in_the_Gaussian_graphical_model","2130019_High_dimensional_graphs_and_variable_selection_with_the_LASSO","1909130_Sparse_permutation_invariant_covariance","314896581_Square-Root_Lasso_Pivotal_Recovery_of_Sparse_Signals_via_Conic_Programming","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","261182063_Worst_possible_sub-directions_in_high-dimensional_models","261136687_Confidence_intervals_for_high-dimensional_inverse_covariance_estimation","256548837_Assumption-free_confidence_intervals_for_groups_of_variables_in_sparse_high-dimensional_regression","247261636_Probability_Theory_and_Examples_2nd_Ed","247153153_Rates_of_convergence_of_the_Adaptive_LASSO_estimators_to_the_Oracle_distribution_and_higher_order_refinements_by_the_bootstrap","245991192_Efficient_and_Adaptive_Estimation_in_Non-and_Semiparametric_Models","237197960_Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Regression","237053936_Valid_Post-Selection_Inference","236736787_Statistics_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Method_Theory_and_Applications","236597283_Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition","227369373_Bootstrapping_Lasso_Estimators","224817353_Asymptotic_Statistics","220320861_High_Dimensional_Inverse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_via_Linear_Programming","51969053_Inference_on_Treatment_Effects_After_Selection_Among_High-Dimensional_Controls","51944377_Confidence_Intervals_for_Low-Dimensional_Parameters_in_High-DimensionalLinear_Models","38359294_Honest_Confidence_Regions_for_Nonparametric_Regression","23800116_Covariance_regularization_by_thresholding","2833559_Least_Angle_Regression","2120237_The_Dantzig_Selector_Statistical_Estimation_when_p_is_Much_Larger_than_n"]}
