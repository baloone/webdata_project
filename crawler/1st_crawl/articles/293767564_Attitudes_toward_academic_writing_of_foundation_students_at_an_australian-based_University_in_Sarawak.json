{"id":"293767564_Attitudes_toward_academic_writing_of_foundation_students_at_an_australian-based_University_in_Sarawak","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine foundation students' attitudes toward academic writing, considering gender and age differences. A 29-item questionnaire was adapted to collect data on perceptions toward academic writing, expectations of academic writing, and feedback on academic writing. A two-tailed t-test for equality of means revealed significant gender differences on four items: Writing was more difficult than speaking, (2) Writing English on the job, (3) Using English to write letters, and (4) Expecting to do a lot of writing in various courses. A two-way analysis of variance (Gender x Age) indicated no significant gender differences on all items. Significant age differences were found in only one item, which implied that students had to take exams in English.","authors":["F.L. Yong"],"meta":["March 2010"],"references":[]}
