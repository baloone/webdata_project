{"id":"260040364_Single-image-based_solution_for_optics_temperature-dependent_nonuniformity_correction_in_an_uncooled_long-wave_infrared_camera","abstract":"In this Letter, we propose an efficient and accurate solution to remove temperature-dependent nonuniformity effects introduced by the imaging optics. This single-image-based approach computes optics-related fixed pattern noise (FPN) by fitting the derivatives of correction model to the gradient components, locally computed on an infrared image. A modified bilateral filtering algorithm is applied to local pixel output variations, so that the refined gradients are most likely caused by the nonuniformity associated with optics. The estimated bias field is subtracted from the raw infrared imagery to compensate the intensity variations caused by optics. The proposed method is fundamentally different from the existing nonuniformity correction (NUC) techniques developed for focal plane arrays (FPAs) and provides an essential image processing functionality to achieve completely shutterless NUC for uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging systems.","authors":["Yanpeng Cao","Christel-Loic Tisse"],"meta":["February 2014Optics Letters 39(3):646-8","DOI:10.1364/OL.39.000646","SourcePubMed"],"references":["253679254_LWIR_NUC_using_an_uncooled_microbolometer_camera","49782184_Total_variation_approach_for_adaptive_nonuniformity_correction_in_focal-plane_arrays","260669848_Solid-state_temperature-dependent_NUC_Non-Uniformity_Correction_in_uncooled_LWIR_Long-Wave_Infra-Red_Imaging_System","257301242_Shutterless_solution_for_simultaneous_focal_plane_array_temperature_estimation_and_nonuniformity_correction_in_uncooled_long-wave_infrared_camera","234250243_Linear_theory_of_nonuniformity_correction_in_infrared_staring_sensors","220611401_Scene_based_non-uniformity_correction_in_thermal_images_using_Kalman_filter","12792786_A_fast_model_independent_method_for_automatic_correction_of_intensity_nonuniformity_in_MRI_data","7460832_Intensity_Nonuniformity_Correction_in_MRI_Existing_Methods_and_Their_Validation","3326994_Nonuniformity_Correction_of_Infrared_Image_Sequences_Using_the_Constant-Statistics_Constraint"]}
