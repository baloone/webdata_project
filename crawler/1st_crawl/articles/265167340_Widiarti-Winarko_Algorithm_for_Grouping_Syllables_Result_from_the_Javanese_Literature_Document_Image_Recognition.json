{"id":"265167340_Widiarti-Winarko_Algorithm_for_Grouping_Syllables_Result_from_the_Javanese_Literature_Document_Image_Recognition","abstract":"Document image recognition can be used to help translate ancient documents written in javanese character. If the ancient documents mentioned written in latin character, it can be read by young people in Indonesia today for various purposes and in an effort to help preserve the rich culture especially in Javanese literature. One of the problems in the document image recognition for Javanese literature is how can make words from syllabel sequence which are result of Javanese character recognition into the correct words in the Javanese language rules, because there are not space in the rules of the Javanese character written.This paper describes Widiarti-Winarko algorithm that can be used to grouping syllables Javanese language combined with the ability of lucene as a software to create a dictionary of Javanese words. The dictionary used to check whether the output words are the correct form. Results from the test in the output of document image recognition in the two pages Hamong Tani book, with the source data dictionary maker from all of pages Hamong Tani book, the system gave a words found by the truth of the formation of words in context sentences of 62.96%, and 75% found the word correctly in the Javanese language. By looking at the magnitude of the percentage of the truth of the formation of words in context sentences are still below 70%, it still needs to be improvements in the algorithm.","authors":["Anastasia Widiarti","Edi Winarko"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.13140/2.1.2917.3122","Conference: 16th WSEAS International Conference on ComputersAt: Kos Island, Greece"],"references":["317580935_Building_Search_Applications_with_Lucene_and_LingPipe","252068846_Measuring_the_Impact_of_Sense_Similarity_on_Word_Sense_Induction","237243674_English-to-Indonesian_Lexical_Mapping_using_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","43329170_STUDI_ANALISIS_METODE-METODE_PARSING_DAN_INTERPRETASI_SEMANTIK_PADA_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING"]}
