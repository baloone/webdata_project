{"id":"242790259_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_GcdmdGcdmd_with_d2d2","abstract":"Two spanning trees of a graph G are said to be independent if they are rooted at the same vertex r, and for each vertex vr in G, the two different paths from v to r, one path in each tree, are internally disjoint. A set of spanning trees of G is independent if they are pairwise independent. The construction of multiple independent spanning trees has many applications in network communication. For instance, it is useful for fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. A recursive circulant graph G(N,d) has N=cd^m vertices labeled from 0 to N-1, where d>=2, m>=1, and 1=2, where the number of independent spanning trees matches the connectivity of G(cd^m,d).","authors":["Jinn-Shyong Yang","Jou-ming Chang","Shyue-Ming Tang","Yue-Li Wang"],"meta":["May 2009Theoretical Computer Science 410(21-23):2001-2010","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2008.12.042"],"references":["228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","221543452_Hamiltonian_Decomposition_of_Recursive_Circulants","220587447_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Hypercubes","220155593_Recursive_circulants_and_their_embeddings_among_hypercubes","3593765_Recursive_circulant_a_new_topology_for_multicomputer_networks","3301188_Reducing_the_Height_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Chordal_Rings","312970347_Recursive_Circulant_A_New_Topology_for_Multicomputer_Networks","264719533_Three_tree-paths","262869923_Disjoint_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_recursive_circulant_graphs","229542814_Dyeing_laboratory_developments","226213356_Routing_in_Recursive_Circulant_Graphs_Edge_Forwarding_Index_and_Hamiltonian_Decomposition","223085074_Finding_nonseparating_induced_cycles_and_independent_spanning_trees_in_3-connected_graphs","223000268_Embedding_trees_in_recursive_circulants","222832336_Pancyclicity_of_recursive_circulant_graphs","222814706_Parallel_construction_of_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_on_hypercubes","222754329_Application_of_the_special_Latin_square_to_a_parallel_routing_algorithm_on_a_recursive_circulant_network","222685078_Nagamochi_H_Independent_spanning_trees_with_small_depths_in_iterated_line_digraphs_Discrete_Appl_Math_10_189-211","222442292_Multiplicative_circulant_networks_topological_properties_and_communication_algorithms","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","220752925_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Product_Graphs","220618379_Finding_Four_Independent_Trees","220616592_Disjoint_Rooted_Spanning_Trees_with_Small_Depths_in_deBruijn_and_Kautz_Graphs","220265807_Embedding_Full_Ternary_Trees_into_Recursive_Circulants","220246046_Hamiltonian_Properties_of_Faulty_Recursive_Circulant_Graphs","220189707_Hamiltonian_decomposition_of_recursive_circulant_graphs","220151352_Panconnectivity_and_edge-pancyclicity_of_faulty_recursive_circulant_G2","220113021_The_super-connected_property_of_recursive_circulant_graphs","220112701_Edge-pancyclicity_of_recursive_circulants","220111575_Maximum_induced_subgraph_of_a_recursive_circulant","32164419_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Chordal_Rings","3848123_Construction_of_a_parallel_and_shortest_routing_algorithm_on_recursive_circulant_networks","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks","3300197_Honeycomb_networks_Topological_properties_and_communication_algorithms","2465538_Disjoint_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_recursive_circulant_graphs"]}
