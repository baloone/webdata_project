{"id":"310661373_On_the_separability_of_quadrilaterals_in_the_plane_by_translations_and_rotations","abstract":"A proof is given that for all positive integers \\(n \\ge 7\\) there exist sets of n non-overlapping quadrilaterals in the plane, such that no non-empty proper subset of these quadrilaterals can be separated from its complement, as one rigid object, by a single translation, without disturbing its complement. Furthermore, examples are given for which no single quadrilateral can be separated from the others by means of translations or rotations.","authors":["Michael E. Houle","Godfried T.
