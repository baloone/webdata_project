{"id":"338850545_Measuring_subjectively_experienced_time_in_usability_and_user_experience_testing_scenarios","abstract":"Du­ra­tion per­cep­tion in­flu­ences de­ci­sion and eval­u­a­tion processes in daily life. Nev­er­the­less, sub­jec­tively ex­pe­ri­enced time is not com­monly con­sid­ered in us­abil­ity and user ex­pe­ri­ence (UX) test­ing sce­nar­ios. In this pa­per, we in­tro­duce an easy way to mea­sure sub­jec­tively ex­pe­ri­enced time (SXT) and in­te­grate it into a frame­work of UX, both the­o­ret­i­cally and em­pir­i­cally. In two stud­ies ( and ), we show that SXT can be eval­u­ated by users af­ter solv­ing tasks on a web­site. More­over, we show that it cor­re­lates sub­stan­tially with com­po­nents of UX but that it is not re­dun­dant to com­mon UX mea­sures. Ad­di­tion­ally, we show that vary­ing as­pects of the web­site (us­abil­ity) and the eval­u­a­tion task (think aloud) show sim­i­lar ef­fects on both SXT and UX mea­sures. Our re­sults sug­gest that SXT is partly based on the es­ti­mated clock time as dis­tor­tions in es­ti­ma­tions trans­late into sub­jec­tively ex­pe­ri­enced time. We con­clude that users per­ceive time dur­ing an on­go­ing in­ter­ac­tion with a tech­ni­cal de­vice, that they eval­u­ate it, and in­te­grate this eval­u­a­tion into their UX eval­u­a­tion. Hence, the pre­sented way of mea­sur­ing SXT can be handy for UX prac­ti­tion­ers to un­der­stand how ob­jec­tive tem­po­ral char­ac­ter­is­tics of the in­ter­ac­tion trans­late into UX, es­pe­cially when de­sign­ing tem­po­ral as­pects of in­ter­ac­tions to elicit a pos­i­tive UX.","authors":["Anna Katharina Trukenbrod","Nils Backhaus","Roland Thomaschke"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal
