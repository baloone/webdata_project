{"id":"317486083_Parallel_Parity_Games_a_Multicore_Attractor_for_the_Zielonka_Recursive_Algorithm","abstract":"Parity games are abstract infinite-duration two-player games, widely studied in computer science. Several solution algorithms have been proposed and also implemented in the community tool of choice called PGSolver, which has declared the Zielonka Recursive (ZR) algorithm the best performing on randomly generated games. With the aim of scaling and solving wider classes of parity games, several improvements and optimizations have been proposed over the existing algorithms. However, no one has yet explored the benefit of using the full computational power of which even common modern multicore processors are capable of. This is even more surprisingly by considering that most of the advanced algorithms in PGSolver are sequential.","authors":["R.
