{"id":"321124692_Faster_Methods_for_Contracting_Infinite_2D_Tensor_Networks","abstract":"We revisit the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group (CTMRG) method of Nishino and Okunishi for contracting 2-dimensional tensor networks, and demonstrate that its performance can be substantially improved by determining the tensors using an eigenvalue solver as opposed to the power method used in CTMRG. We also generalize the variational uniform Matrix Product State (VUMPS) ansatz for diagonalizing 1D quantum Hamiltonians to the case of 2D transfer matrices, and discuss similarities with the corner methods. These two new algorithms will be crucial in improving the performance of variational Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) methods.","authors":["M. T. Fishman","L.
