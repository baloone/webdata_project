{"id":"346316971_The_challenges_of_implementing_transactive_energy_A_comparative_analysis_of_experimental_projects","abstract":"This study examines the results of field experiments of transactive energy systems (TESs) in order to identify challenges that occur with the integration of TESs with existing software, hardware, appliances, and customer practices. Three types of challenges, and potential responses and solutions, are identified for the implementation phase of TESs: systematic risk to existing building functions, lack of readiness of users and connected systems, and lack of competitiveness with existing demand-management systems and products.","authors":["Dasom Lee","David J.
