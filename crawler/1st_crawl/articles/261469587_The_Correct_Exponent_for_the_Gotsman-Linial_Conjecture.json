{"id":"261469587_The_Correct_Exponent_for_the_Gotsman-Linial_Conjecture","abstract":"We prove new bounds on the average sensitivity of polynomial threshold functions. In particular, we show the average sensitivity of a polynomial threshold function of constant degree is not much more than the square root of the dimension of its space of definition. This bound amounts to a significant improvement over previous bounds, and in particular, for fixed degree provides the correct asymptotic exponent in the dimension.","authors":["Daniel Kane"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings of the Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2013.15","Conference: Computational Complexity (CCC), 2013 IEEE Conference on"],"references":["220441640_Spectral_Properties_of_Threshold_Functions","220268418_Bounding_the_average_sensitivity_and_noise_sensitivity_of_polynomial_threshold_functions","45874960_Average_Sensitivity_and_Noise_Sensitivity_of_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","45874676_A_Regularity_Lemma_and_Low-Weight_Approximators_for_Low-Degree_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","266216856_Additive_functionals_on_spaces_with_non-absolutely-continuous_norm","265535961_Distributional_and_L_q_norm_inequalities_for_polynomials_over_convex_bodies_in_R_n","265426265_Gaussian_Hilbert_Spaces","261025117_A_Small_PRG_for_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions_of_Gaussians","243022273_The_free_Markoff_field1","238344580_The_free_Markov_field","238225952_Etudes_des_coefficients_Fourier_des_fonctiones_de_LpG","231913363_A_note_on_analytic_functions_in_the_unit_circle","225449566_Gaussian_Bounds_for_Noise_Correlation_of_Functions","222100955_A_Structure_Theorem_for_Poorly_Anticoncentrated_Gaussian_Chaoses_andApplications_to_the_Study_of_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","221580847_The_Gaussian_Surface_Area_and_Noise_Sensitivity_of_Degree-d_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","51021796_A_Small_PRG_for_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions_of_Gaussians","45875124_Bounding_the_Sensitivity_of_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","4186683_Noise_stability_of_functions_with_low_influences_Invariance_and_optimality"]}
