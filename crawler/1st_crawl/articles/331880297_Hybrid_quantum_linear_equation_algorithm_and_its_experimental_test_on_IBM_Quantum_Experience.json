In this paper, we show that our hybrid algorithm can reduce a circuit depth from the original HHL algorithm by means of a classical information feed-forward after the quantum phase estimation algorithm, and the results of the hybrid algorithm are identical to those of the HHL algorithm. In addition, it is experimentally examined with four qubits in the IBM Quantum Experience setups, and the experimental results of our algorithm show higher accurate performance on specific systems of linear equations than that of the HHL algorithm.","authors":["Yonghae Lee","Jaewoo Joo","Soojoon Lee"],"meta":["March 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-41324-9"],"references":["311067037_Efficient_Variational_Quantum_Simulator_Incorporating_Active_Error_Minimization","264742794_Quantum_algorithms_for_topological_and_geometric_analysis_of_big_data","257978778_Arbitrary_accuracy_iterative_quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm_using_a_single_ancillary_qubit_A_two-qubit_benchmark","323571044_Reconsider_HHL_algorithm_and_its_related_quantum_machine_learning_algorithms","315454606_Solving_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_with_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Processor","311492464_Error_Mitigation_for_Short-Depth_Quantum_Circuits","311430113_Efficient_Z-Gates_for_Quantum_Computing","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","277614392_Read_the_fine_print","265827984_Quantum_Information_Theory"]}
