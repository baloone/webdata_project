{"id":"337196312_Risk_Assesment","abstract":"Risk assessment is a fundamental step in the management and reduction of risks. Risk assessments require inputs from experts in different hazard-related fields, and in the case of risks associated to geologic hazards, will involve engineering geologists in this process. Risk assessments also involve assessing vulnerabilities and finally the potential losses that may occur, as well as their associated likelihood. The risk assessment process therefore integrates multidisciplinary efforts, aiming to produce a result that is useful for decision-making on how to manage the risk.","authors":["RÃ¼diger Escobar Wolf","El Hachemi Bouali","Thomas Oommen"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-73568-9_239"],"references":["318780841_Knowing_better_and_losing_even_more_The_use_of_knowledge_in_hazards_management"]}
