{"id":"324477350_An_interactive_clothing_design_and_personalized_virtual_display_system","abstract":"An interactive clothing design and a personalized virtual display with user’s own face are presented in this paper to meet the requirement of personalized clothing customization. A customer interactive clothing design approach based on genetic engineering ideas is analyzed by taking suit as an example. Thus, customers could rearrange the clothing style elements, chose available color, fabric and come up with their own personalized suit style. A web 3D customization prototype system of personalized clothing is developed based on the Unity3D and VR technology. The layout of the structure and functions combined with the flow of the system are given. Practical issues such as 3D face scanning, suit style design, fabric selection, and accessory choices are addressed also. Tests to the prototype system indicate that it could show realistic clothing and fabric effect and offer effective visual and customization experience to users.","authors":["Xin-juan Zhu","Haiqing Lu","Matthias Rätsch"],"meta":["October 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(7):1-17","DOI:10.1007/s11042-018-5912-x"],"references":["320730971_A_3D_Face_Modelling_Approach_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition_in_a_Human-Robot_Environment","315785263_3D_Virtual_Prototyping_of_Garments_Approaches_Developments_and_Challenges","314537302_Passively_self-aligned_assembly_of_compact_barrel_hinges_for_high-performance_out-of-plane_mems_actuators","312425986_Real-Time_3D_Face_Fitting_and_Texture_Fusion_on_In-the-Wild_Videos","305623622_Novel_descriptors_for_geometrical_3D_face_analysis","303754980_A_3D_Face_Modelling_Approach_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition_in_a_Human-Robot_Environment","285054377_A_Multiresolution_3D_Morphable_Face_Model_and_Fitting_Framework","278630315_Higher-Order_Graph_Principles_towards_Non-Rigid_Surface_Registration","275540226_Virtual_Fitting_-_Innovative_Technology_for_Customize_Clothing_Design","300415781_A_pivot-hinged_multilayer_SU-8_micro_motion_amplifier_assembled_by_a_self-aligned_approach"]}
