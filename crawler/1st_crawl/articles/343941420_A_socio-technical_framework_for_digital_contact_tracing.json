{"id":"343941420_A_socio-technical_framework_for_digital_contact_tracing","abstract":"In their efforts to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, decision makers are considering the development and use of smartphone applications for contact tracing. Even though these applications differ in technology and methods, there is an increasing concern about their implications for privacy and human rights. Here we propose a framework to evaluate their suitability in terms of impact on the users, employed technology and governance methods. We illustrate its usage with three applications, and with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) guidelines, highlighting their limitations.","authors":["Ricardo Vinuesa","Andreas Theodorou","Manuela Battaglini","Virginia Dignum"],"meta":["August 2020","DOI:10.1016/j.rineng.2020.100163"],"references":["341719461_Ethical_guidelines_for_COVID-19_tracing_apps","340316786_Quantifying_SARS-CoV-2_transmission_suggests_epidemic_control_with_digital_contact_tracing","338554769_The_role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_achieving_the_Sustainable_Development_Goals","341306619_Ethics_and_governance_for_digital_disease_surveillance","337014098_Responsible_Artificial_Intelligence_How_to_Develop_and_Use_AI_in_a_Responsible_Way"]}
