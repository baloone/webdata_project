{"id":"331048413_Naming_the_Pain_in_Developing_Scientific_Software","abstract":"The scientific software community is eagerly embracing software development practices and tools. However, the lack of Computer Science background, in general, and Software Engineering training, in particular, pose a toll on scientists that need to develop software. Although some of the problems that scientific software developers face when developing scientific software are already known in the literature, we believe that a comprehensive characterization of this complex landscape is still missing. In this paper we build a taxonomy of 2,110 problems (the so called \"pains\") reported by 1,577 scientific software developers. These problems are grouped into three major axes: technical-related, social-related, and scientific-related problems. Our report helps to better understand the needs and challenges of this so far not fully understood community.","authors":["Igor Scaliante Wiese","Ivanilton Polato","Gustavo Pinto"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Software PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/MS.2019.2899838","Project: Understanding Open-Source Software and Communities"],"references":["323153146_How_Do_Scientists_Develop_Scientific_Software_An_External_Replication","311410875_Naming_the_pain_in_requirements_engineering_comparing_practices_in_Brazil_and_Germany","307564171_Good_Enough_Practices_in_Scientific_Computing","259701267_Best_Practices_for_Scientific_Computing","230764805_Organizational_Social_Structures_for_Software_Engineering","228705905_Towards_reporting_guidelines_for_experimental_replications_A_proposal","220092945_Understanding_the_High-Performance-Computing_Community_A_Software_Engineer's_Perspective","326561306_Understanding_the_usage_impact_and_adoption_of_non-OSI_approved_licenses","297608935_Software_Engineering_for_Science","271589480_Qualitative_Methods_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Software_Engineering"]}
