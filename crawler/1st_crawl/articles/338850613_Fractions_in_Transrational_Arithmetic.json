{"id":"338850613_Fractions_in_Transrational_Arithmetic","abstract":"In transrational arithmetic each closed fraction may be written as a simple fraction. It is shown that unlike in involutive meadows, in transrational arithmetic open fractions cannot be written as a sum of simple fractions (i.e. fractions the numerator and denominator of which are polynomials). It is also not the case that each open fraction with a single variable can be written as a mixed fraction.","authors":["Jan Bergstra"],"meta":["January 2020Transmathematica","DOI:10.36285/tm.19"],"references":["266036168_Free_algebras_over_all_fields_and_pseudo-fields","263471497_Division_by_Zero_in_Common_Meadows","249812219_Perspex_Machine_VIII_axioms_of_transreal_arithmetic","318125551_Universality_of_Univariate_Mixed_Fractions_in_Divisive_Meadows","285538863_Construction_of_the_Transcomplex_Numbers_From_the_Complex_Numbers","283117920_Transformation_of_fractions_into_simple_fractions_in_divisive_meadows","277885262_Note_on_paraconsistency_and_reasoning_about_fractions","277808991_Partiality_and_Choice_Foundational_Contributions","248423994_What_Numbers_Could_not_Be","243113671_Equational_theories_and_universal_theories_of_fields"]}
