{"id":"291229449_New_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_from_Generalized_Reed-Solomon_Codes","abstract":"Both MDS and Euclidean self-dual codes have theoretical and practical\nimportance and the study of MDS self-dual codes has attracted lots of attention\nin recent years. In particular, determining existence of $q$-ary MDS self-dual\ncodes for various lengths has been investigated extensively. The problem is\ncompletely solved for the case where $q$ is even. The current paper focuses on\nthe case where $q$ is odd. We construct a few classes of new MDS self-dual code\nthrough generalized Reed-Solomon codes. More precisely, we show that for any\ngiven even length $n$ we have a $q$-ary MDS code as long as $q\\equiv1\\bmod{4}$\nand $q$ is sufficiently large (say $q\\ge 2^n\\times n^2)$. Furthermore, we prove\nthat there exists a $q$-ary MDS self-dual code of length $n$ if $q=r^2$ and $n$\nsatisfies one of the three conditions: (i) $n\\le r$ and $n$ is even; (ii) $q$\nis odd and $n-1$ is an odd divisor of $q-1$; (iii) $r\\equiv3\\mod{4}$ and\n$n=2tr$ for any $t\\le (r-1)/2$.","authors":["Lingfei Jin","Chaoping Xing"],"meta":["January 2016IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2645759","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268895288_On_the_1056_9_Reed-Solomon_and_Glynn_codes","268689393_On_the_Classification_of_MDS_Codes","259764579_On_the_Existence_of_MDS_Codes_Over_Small_Fields_With_Constrained_Generator_Matrices","251375604_New_MDS_self-dual_codes_over_finite_fields","234689322_Balanced_Sparsest_Generator_Matrices_for_MDS_Codes","4353212_Secret-sharing_schemes_based_on_self-dual_codes","3087035_New_MDS_or_near-MDS_self-dual_codes","3086847_On_Codes_Matroids_and_Secure_Multiparty_Computation_From_Linear_Secret-Sharing_Schemes","3085910_Lowest_Density_MDS_Codes_Over_Extension_Alphabets","3079701_On_lowest_density_MDS_codes","268491888_Orthogonal_designs_and_MDS_self-dual_codes","257481663_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_over_Large_Prime_Fields","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","224324944_On_self-dual_MDS_codes","222778214_Euclidean_and_Hermitian_self-dual_MDS_codes_over_large_finite_fields","220189032_On_self-dual_codes_over_some_prime_fields","3077735_Classification_of_pseudo-cyclic_MDS_codes","3077339_A_construction_of_non-Reed-Solomon_type_MDS_codes","2242670_Some_Applications_of_Coding_Theory_in_Cryptography"]}
