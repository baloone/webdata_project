{"id":"258285203_A_survey_on_Data_Mining_approaches_for_Healthcare","abstract":"Data Mining is one of the most motivating area of research th\nat is become increasingly\npopular in health organization. Data Mining plays an important role for uncovering new\ntrends in healthcare organization which in turn helpful for all the parties associated with this\nfield. This survey explores the utility of var\nious Data Mining techniques such as\nclassification, clustering, association, regression in health domain. In this paper, we present\na brief introduction of these techniques and their advantages and disadvantages. This survey\nalso highlights applications, c\nhallenges and future issues of Data Mining in healthcare.\nRecommendation regarding the suitable choice of available Data Mining technique is also\ndiscussed in this paper.","authors":["Divya Tomar"],"meta":["October 2013International Journal of  Bio-Science and Bio-Technology 5(5):241-266","DOI:10.14257/ijbsbt.2013.5.5.25"],"references":["288835251_Data_Mining-_Introductory_and_Advanced_Topics","285843397_Mining_association_rules_between_set_of_items_in_largedatabases","283968335_Applications_of_data_mining_techniques_in_healthcare_and_prediction_of_heart_attacks","330244366_Comparative_Study_of_Data_Mining_Classification_Algorithms_in_Heart_Disease_Prediction","310625210_Caring_for_healthcare","291294410_Patients_length_of_stay_grouping_using_the_hierarchical_clustering_algorithm","289713227_Intelligent_and_effective_heart_attack_prediction_system_using_data_mining_and_artificial_neural_network","289315158_A_Hybrid_Data_Mining_Method_for_the_Medical_Classification_of_Chest_Pain","288969606_Data_mining_and_knowledge_discovery_in_databases","288860320_An_improved_medical_diagnosing_technique_using_spatial_association_rules"]}
