{"id":"236868788_Designing_for_Learning_in_an_Open_World","abstract":"This chapter provides an introduction to and rationale for the book. It begins by arguing that in today’s technologically rich context, where content and services are increasingly free, we need to rethink approaches to the design of learning activities and content. This chapter begins with an overview of the context of modern education, before looking at the characteristics of today’s learners and how they are using technologies. The concept of ‘learning design’ is introduced and, in particular, the notion that making design processes more explicit and shareable will enable teachers to develop more effective learning environments and interventions for learners. It will help learners to make more sense of their educational provision and associated learning pathways.","authors":["Grainne Conole"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4419-8517-0","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-1-4419-8516-3"],"references":["220131885_Analysing_student_engagement_with_learning_and_tutoring_activities_in_networked_learning_communities_A_multi-method_approach","265092107_Confronting_the_Challenges_of_Participatory_Culture_-_Media_Education_for_the_21st_Century_Part_2","246346821_Growing_Up_Digital_The_Rise_of_the_Net_Generation_New_York_McGraw-Hill","242338264_Wired_Warp_and_Woof_An_Ethnographic_Study_of_a_Networking_Class","233224826_The_Perceptions_of_New_Orleans_Educators_on_the_Process_of_Rebuilding_the_New_Orleans_School_System_after_Katrina","225552234_A_history_of_instructional_design_and_technology_Part_I_A_history_of_instructional_media","222425397_'Disruptive_technologies'_'pedagogical_innovation'_What's_new_Findings_from_an_in-depth_study_of_students'_use_and_perception_of_technology"]}
