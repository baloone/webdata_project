{"id":"320727231_Improved_Bounds_for_Testing_Forbidden_Order_Patterns","abstract":"A sequence $f\\colon\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ contains a permutation $\\pi$ of length $k$ if there exist $i_1<\\dots<i_k$ such that, for all $x,y$, $f(i_x)<f(i_y)$ if and only if $\\pi(x)<\\pi(y)$; otherwise, $f$ is said to be $\\pi$-free. In this work, we consider the problem of testing for $\\pi$-freeness with one-sided error, continuing the investigation of [Newman et al., SODA'17]. We demonstrate a surprising behavior for non-adaptive tests with one-sided error: While a trivial sampling-based approach yields an $\\varepsilon$-test for $\\pi$-freeness making $\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{-1/k} n^{1-1/k})$ queries, our lower bounds imply that this is almost optimal for most permutations! Specifically, for most permutations $\\pi$ of length $k$, any non-adaptive one-sided $\\varepsilon$-test requires $\\varepsilon^{-1/(k-\\Theta(1))}n^{1-1/(k-\\Theta(1))}$ queries; furthermore, the permutations that are hardest to test require $\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{-1/(k-1)}n^{1-1/(k-1)})$ queries, which is tight in $n$ and $\\varepsilon$. Additionally, we show two hierarchical behaviors here. First, for any $k$ and $l\\leq k-1$, there exists some $\\pi$ of length $k$ that requires $\\tilde{\\Theta}_{\\varepsilon}(n^{1-1/l})$ non-adaptive queries. Second, we show an adaptivity hierarchy for $\\pi=(1,3,2)$ by proving upper and lower bounds for (one- and two-sided) testing of $\\pi$-freeness with $r$ rounds of adaptivity. The results answer open questions of Newman et al. and [Canonne and Gur, CCC'17].","authors":["Omri Ben-Eliezer","ClÃ©ment L.
