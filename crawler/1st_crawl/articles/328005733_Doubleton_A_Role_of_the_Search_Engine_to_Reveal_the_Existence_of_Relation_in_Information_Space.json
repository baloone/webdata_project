{"id":"328005733_Doubleton_A_Role_of_the_Search_Engine_to_Reveal_the_Existence_of_Relation_in_Information_Space","abstract":"By using Web, information contributes to existence of relation. The information space take a position for exploring presentation and determines the existence of relation. However, this existence depend on the access tool, the search engine. They are as interface for it. A search engine has itself behaviour. This paper express the role of search engines based on doubleton through logical reasoning and the set concept. While a similarity showed the relation is exist.","authors":["Mahyuddin K. M.
