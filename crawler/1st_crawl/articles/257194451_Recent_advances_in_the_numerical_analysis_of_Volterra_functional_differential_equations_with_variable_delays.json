{"id":"257194451_Recent_advances_in_the_numerical_analysis_of_Volterra_functional_differential_equations_with_variable_delays","abstract":"The numerical analysis of Volterra functional integro-differential equations with vanishing delays has to overcome a number of challenges that are not encountered when solving ‘classical’ delay differential equations with non-vanishing delays. In this paper I shall describe recent results in the analysis of optimal (global and local) superconvergence orders in collocation methods for such evolutionary problems. Following a brief survey of results for equations containing Volterra integral operators with non-vanishing delays, the discussion will focus on pantograph-type Volterra integro-differential equations with (linear and nonlinear) vanishing delays. The paper concludes with a section on open problems; these include the asymptotic stability of collocation solutions uhuh on uniform meshes for pantograph-type functional equations, and the analysis of collocation methods for pantograph-type functional equations with advanced arguments.","authors":["Hermann Brunner"],"meta":["June 2009Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics
