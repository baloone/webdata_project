{"id":"314719368_Rudin-Shapiro_sequences_along_squares","abstract":"We estimate exponential sums of the form (Formula Presented) for a large class of digital functions f and ϑ ∈ ℝ. We deduce from these estimates the distribution along squares of this class of digital functions which includes the Rudin–Shapiro sequence and some of its generalizations.","authors":["Christian Mauduit","Joël Rivat"],"meta":["March 2017Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 370(11):1","DOI:10.1090/tran/7210"],"references":[]}
