{"id":"261799454_Dynamics_to_Equilibrium_in_Network_Games_Individual_Behavior_and_Global_Response","abstract":"Various social contexts ranging from public goods provision to information\ncollection can be depicted as games of strategic interactions, where a player's\nwell-being depends on her own action as well as on the actions taken by her\nneighbors. Whereas much attention has been devoted to the identification and\ncharacterization of Bayes-Nash equilibria of such games, in this work we look\nat strategic interactions from an evolutionary perspective. Starting from a\nrecent mean-field analysis of the evolutionary dynamics in these games, here we\npresent results of numerical simulations designed to find out whether Nash\nequilibria are accessible by adaptation of players' strategies, and in general\nto find the attractors of the evolution. Simulations allow us to go beyond a\nglobal characterization of the cooperativeness of the equilibria and probe into\nthe individual behavior. We find that when players imitate each other, the\nevolution does not reach Nash equilibria and, worse, leads to very unfavorable\nstates in terms of welfare. On the contrary, when players update their behavior\nrationally, they self-organize into a rich variety of Nash equilibria, where\nindividual behavior and payoffs are shaped by the nature of the game, the\nstructure of the social network and the players' position within the topology.\nOur results allow us to assess the validity of the mean-field approaches and\nalso show qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions for equilibria in\nthe context of one-shot games under incomplete information.","authors":["Giulio Cimini","Claudio Castellano","Angel SÃ¡nchez"],"meta":["April 2014PLoS ONE 10(3)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0120343","SourcearXiv"],"references":["336952483_Social_and_Economic_Networks","266454271_Game_Theory_Evolving_Second_Edition_A_Problem-Centered_Introduction_to_Modeling_Strategic_Interaction","260557380_Evolutionary_network_games_Imitation_and_Best-Response_dynamics","331307423_Game_Theory_Evolving_A_Problem-Centered_Introduction_to_Modeling_Strategic_Interaction_-_Second_Edition","330691646_Getting_a_Job_A_Study_of_Contacts_and_Careers","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","284674055_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","258864484_The_Logic_of_Animal_Conflict","257314960_Stochastic_stability_in_best_shot_network_games"]}
