Two models of e-learning that are observed among adopting institutions: E-learning as a supplement to traditional classroom mode, and total electronic learning. The respondents in this research have just been introduced to the first model. The paper takes a social, and technical approach in its investigation by using a research model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to identify the factors that affect intention to adopt e-learning. The model identifies specific salient beliefs that may influence technology usage, such as instructors attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived usefulness, ease of use, Normative beliefs, Internet Self-efficacy, Perceived Accessibility and university support. stratified random sampling method was used to select instructors. Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis was used to assess the relationships in the constructs. The paper presents some findings on e-learning adoption intention determinants. It also discusses some of the implications of the findings on theory and practice.","authors":["Manal Altawalbeh","Soon Fook Fong","Wun Thiam","Sultan Alshourah"],"meta":["March 2019"],"references":["287556984_E-Learning_in_the_21st_century_A_framework_for_research_and_practice_Second_edition","271617507_Effectiveness_of_Using_Information_Technology_in_Higher_Education_in_Saudi_Arabia","257740195_e-Learning_in_the_Saudi_tertiary_education_Potential_and_challenges","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","315122101_Web_Accessibility_for_People_with_Disabilities","308058706_The_theory_of_planned_behavior_organizational_behavior_and_human_decision_processes","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","292303964_Towards_an_understanding_of_the_behavioural_intention_to_use_a_web_site","287651935_Development_of_an_instrument_to_measure_perceptions_of_adoption_of_an_information_technology_innovations","255591557_An_empirical_investigation_on_learners'_acceptance_of_e-learning_for_public_unemployment_vocational_training"]}
