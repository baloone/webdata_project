{"id":"311474810_Influence_of_the_familiarization_with_scratch_on_future_teachers'_opinions_and_attitudes_about_programming_and_ICT_in_education","abstract":"Computer programming is considered a very important competence which is usually quite difficult to learn. Teaching computer programming to novices has to overcome important obstacles in order to be successful. The problem is even greater for non computer science majors. In order to overcome the difficulties and increase the rate of students that adopt positive views towards computer science, several educational programming environments have been proposed. Scratch educational programming environment offers innovative programming techniques and enables the rather easy development of games, animations, interactive stories etc. In this paper the effects of using Scratch in an introductory computer programming course for future teachersâ€Ÿ attitudes and opinions are explored.","authors":["Georgios Fesakis","Kiriaki Serafeim"],"meta":["August 2009ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 41(3):258","DOI:10.1145/1595496.1562957"],"references":["271503973_Effects_of_an_Educational_Computing_Course_on_Preservice_and_Inservice_Teachers_A_Discussion_and_Analysis_of_Attitudes_and_Use","270606116_Programming_by_choice","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","242608727_Log_on_education_teaching_the_nintendo_generation_to_program","228675359_Factors_affecting_the_success_of_non-majors_in_learning_to_program","228632749_ScratchR_Sharing_User-generated_Programmable_Media","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","221538264_'scratch'_your_way_to_introductory_cs","221538253_Scratching_the_surface_of_advanced_topics_in_software_engineering_a_workshop_module_for_middle_school_students","221329203_Programming_Environments_for_End-Users"]}
