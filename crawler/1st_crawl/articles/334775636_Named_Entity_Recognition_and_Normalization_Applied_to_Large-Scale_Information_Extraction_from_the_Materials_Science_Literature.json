{"id":"334775636_Named_Entity_Recognition_and_Normalization_Applied_to_Large-Scale_Information_Extraction_from_the_Materials_Science_Literature","abstract":"The number of published materials science articles has increased manyfold over the past few decades. Now, a major bottleneck in the materials discovery pipeline arises in connecting new results with the previously established literature. A potential solution to this problem is to map the unstructured raw-text of published articles onto structured database entries that allows for programmatic querying. To this end, we apply text-mining with named entity recognition (NER) for large-scale information extraction from the published materials science literature. The NER model is trained to extract summary-level information from materials science documents, including: inorganic material mentions, sample descriptors, phase labels, material properties and applications, as well as any synthesis and characterization methods used. Our classifier achieves an accuracy (f1) of 87%, and is applied to information extraction from 3.27 million materials science abstracts. We extract more than 80 million materials-science-related named entities, and the content of each abstract is represented as a database entry in a structured format. We demonstrate that simple database queries can be used to answer complex ``meta-questions\" of the published literature that would have previously required laborious, manual literature searches to answer. All of our data and functionality has been made freely available (https://github.com/materialsintelligence/matscholar), and we expect these results to accelerate the pace of future materials science discovery.","authors":["Leigh Weston","Vahe Tshitoyan","John M.
