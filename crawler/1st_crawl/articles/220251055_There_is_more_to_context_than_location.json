{"id":"220251055_There_is_more_to_context_than_location","abstract":"Context is a key issue in interaction between human and computer, describing the surrounding facts that add meaning. In mobile computing location is usually used to approximate context and to implement context-aware applications. We propose that ultra-mobile computing, characterized by devices that are operational and operated while on the move (e.g. PDAs, mobile phones, wearable computers), can significantly benefit from a wider notion of context. To structure the field we introduce a working model for context, discuss mechanisms to acquire context beyond location, and application of context-awareness in ultra-mobile computing. We investigate the utility of sensors for context-awareness and present two prototypical implementations â€” a light-sensitive display and an orientation-aware PDA interface. The concept is then extended to a model for sensor fusion to enable more sophisticated context recognition. Based on an implementation of the model an experiment is described and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Further, we explore fusion of sensors for acquisition of information on more sophisticated contexts.","authors":["Albrecht Schmidt","Michael Beigl","Hans Gellersen"],"meta":["December 1999Computers & Graphics 23(6):893-901","DOI:10.1016/S0097-8493(99)00120-X","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221513676_Squeeze_Me_Hold_Me_Tilt_Me_An_Exploration_of_Manipulative_User_Interfaces","220877455_Tilting_Operations_for_Small_Screen_Interfaces","220515649_The_Active_Badge_Location_System","27521536_Cyberguide_A_Mobile_Context-Aware_Tour_Guide","4374664_Context-Aware_Computing_Applications","3717885_Nomadic_radio_a_spatialized_audio_environment_for_wearable_computing","2415659_StartleCam_A_Cybernetic_Wearable_Camera","313506740_The_Stick-e_Document_A_Framework_for_Creating_Context-aware_Applications_Electronic_Publishing_-_Origination","242406655_Smartbadges_a_wearable_computer_and_communication_system","228550918_The_Stick-E_Document_A_Framework_for_Creating_Context-Aware_Applications","222499164_Design_of_an_object_model_for_a_context_sensitive_tourist_GUIDE","222304128_Location_service_in_mobile_computing_environments","221515795_Investigating_the_Capture_Integration_and_Access_Problem_of_Ubiquitous_Computing_in_an_Educational_Setting","200459314_Enhanced_Reality_Fieldwork_the_Context_Aware_Archaeolgical_Assistant","3779003_Adding_generic_contextual_capabilities_to_wearable_computers","3778995_Context-aware_adaptive_wearable_computers_as_remote_interfaces_to_'intelligent'_environments","3778993_StartleCam_a_cybernetic_wearable_camera","3343994_A_new_location_for_the_active_office","3343988_Context-Aware_Applications_From_the_Laboratory_to_the_Marketplace","2249868_A_New_Location_Technique_for_the_Active_Office"]}
