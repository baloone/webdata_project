In these emerging fields, there is a need for computerized systems to have a higher understanding of the situations in which to provide services or functionalities, to adapt accordingly. The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better fit the needs of context-aware computing. These efforts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving specific development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analysing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; C) Context-aware systems conceptualization.\nFull text at: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121216000467","authors":["Unai Alegre","Juan Carlos Augusto Wrede","Tony Clark"],"meta":["February 2016Journal of Systems and Software 117","DOI:10.1016/j.jss.2016.02.010","Project: projects by the GOODIES"],"references":["319393620_Requirements_engineering_a_roadmap","298435970_Designing_more_reliable_MAS-based_ambient_intelligence_systems","297322975_Is_context-aware_computing_taking_control_away_from_the_user_Three_levels_of_interactivity_examined","328730859_What_Every_Engineer_Should_Know_about_Software_Engineering","324308514_Plans_and_Situated_Actions_The_Problem_of_Human-Machine_Communication","314722573_The_challenges_of_user-centered_design_and_evaluation_for_infrastructure","313730983_The_computer_for_the_21st_century","311477028_Using_document-oriented_GUIs_in_dynamic_software_product_lines","308951555_MLContext_A_Context-Modeling_Language_for_Context-Aware_Systems","303281772_Software_engineering_for_self-adaptive_systems_A_second_research_roadmap"]}
