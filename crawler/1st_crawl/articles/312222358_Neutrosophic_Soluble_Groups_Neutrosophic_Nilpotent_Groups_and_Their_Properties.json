{"id":"312222358_Neutrosophic_Soluble_Groups_Neutrosophic_Nilpotent_Groups_and_Their_Properties","abstract":"The theory of soluble groups and nilpotent groups is old and hence a generalized on. In this paper, we introduced neutrosophic soluble groups and neutrosophic nilpotent groups which have some kind of indeterminacy. These notions are generalized to the classic notions of soluble groups and nilpotent groups. We also derive some new type of series which derived some new notions of soluble groups and nilpotent groups. They are mixed neutrosophic soluble groups and mixed neutrosophic nilpotent groups as well as strong neutrosophic soluble groups and strong neutrosophic nilpotent groups.","authors":["Mumtaz Ali","Florentin Smarandache"],"meta":["March 2015","Project: New Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications"],"references":["308949256_A_UNIFYING_FIELD_IN_LOGICS_NEUTROSOPHIC_LOGIC_NEUTROSOPHY_NEUTROSOPHIC_SET_NEUTROSOPHIC_PROBABILITY_AND_STATISTICS","308885739_Generalization_of_Neutrosophic_Rings_and_Neutrosophic_Fields","2126825_Some_Neutrosophic_Algebraic_Structures_and_Neutrosophic_N-Algebraic_Structures","285380037_Generalized_nilpotent_algebras_and_their_associated_groups","268493069_The_theory_of_groups_2nd_ed","268247920_Banach_algebras_and_the_general_theory_of_-algebras_II_-algebras","267055748_The_theory_of_groups","257947246_Banach_algebras_and_the_general_theory_of_-algebras_Vol_2","44468395_An_introduction_to_the_theory_of_groups_Joseph_J_Rotman","27293842_Homology_in_Group_Theory"]}
