{"id":"254462268_What_can_Model-Based_UI_Design_offer_to_End-User_Software_Engineering","abstract":"End-User Programming enables end users to create their own programs. This can be accomplished in different ways, where one of them is by appropriation or reconfiguration of existing software. However, there is a trade-off between end users' 'situated design' and quality design which is addressed in End-User Software Engineering. This paper investigates how methods and techniques from Model-Based UI Design can contribute to End-User Software Engineering. Applying the concept of Extra-UI, the paper describes a Model-Based approach that allows to extend core applications in a way that some of the underlying models and assumptions become manipulable by end users. The approach is discussed through a running example.","authors":["Anke Dittmar","Alfonso Garc√≠a Frey","Sophie Dupuy-Chessa"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1145/2305484.2305515"],"references":["254462049_UsiComp_An_extensible_model-driven_composer","228769232_Opening_the_Box_Meta-level_Interfaces_Needs_and_Solutions","225127025_What_Is_End-User_Software_Engineering_and_Why_Does_It_Matter","222218921_A_Unifying_Reference_Framework_for_Multi-Target_User_Interfaces","221105883_Addressing_the_mapping_problem_in_user_interface_design_with_UsiXML","220780999_A_Model-Driven_Engineering_Approach_for_the_Usability_of_Plastic_User_Interfaces","220728603_QUIMERA_A_quality_metamodel_to_improve_design_rationale","220566620_The_State_of_the_Art_in_End-User_Software_Engineering","220427813_Meta-Design_A_manifesto_for_End-User_Development","313760653_A_model-driven_engineering_approach_for_the_usability_of_plastic_user_interfaces","226163464_Megamodeling_and_Metamodel-Driven_Engineering_for_Plastic_User_Interfaces_MEGA-UI","221097317_Tasks_Models_Merging_for_High-Level_Component_Composition","220959710_The_Influence_of_Improved_Task_Models_on_Dialogues","220728560_Task-based_design_revisited"]}
