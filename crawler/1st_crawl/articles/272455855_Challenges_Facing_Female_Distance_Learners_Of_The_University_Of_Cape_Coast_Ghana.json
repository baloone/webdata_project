{"id":"272455855_Challenges_Facing_Female_Distance_Learners_Of_The_University_Of_Cape_Coast_Ghana","abstract":"This study surveyed the challenges that female students on the University of Cape Coast Distance Education Programme face. A 78 - item questionnaire that yielded a reliability correlation coefficient alpha of 0.79 was used to collect data from 895 participants. The findings show that meetings for face-to-face tutorials and end of semester examinations are not convenient to female distance learners. Other challenges noted were, health problems, difficulty combining house management with studies, meeting financial obligations, time management, access to libraries, and feedback. It is, therefore, suggested that gender sensitive issues should be pushed further to enable female distance learners have a fairer deal and, counseling services should assume a centre stage in the whole Distance Education Programme.
