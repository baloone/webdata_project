{"id":"332349199_Highly_parallel_simulation_and_optimization_of_photonic_circuits_in_time_and_frequency_domain_based_on_the_deep-learning_framework_PyTorch","abstract":"We propose a new method for performing photonic circuit simulations based on the scatter matrix formalism. We leverage the popular deep-learning framework PyTorch to reimagine photonic circuits as sparsely connected complex-valued neural networks. This allows for highly parallel simulation of large photonic circuits on graphical processing units in time and frequency domain while all parameters of each individual component can easily be optimized with well-established machine learning algorithms such as backpropagation.","authors":["Floris Laporte","J.
