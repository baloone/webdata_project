{"id":"260062220_Inferring_the_origin_of_an_epidemic_with_dynamic_message-passing_algorithm","abstract":"We study the problem of estimating the origin of an epidemic outbreak --\ngiven a contact network and a snapshot of epidemic spread at a certain time,\ndetermine the infection source. Finding the source is important in different\ncontexts of computer or social networks. We assume that the epidemic spread\nfollows the most commonly used susceptible-infected-recovered model. We\nintroduce an inference algorithm based on dynamic message-passing equations,\nand we show that it leads to significant improvement of performance compared to\nexisting approaches. Importantly, this algorithm remains efficient in the case\nwhere one knows the state of only a fraction of nodes.","authors":["Andrey Y.
