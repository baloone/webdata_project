{"id":"221498316_Faster_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_All-Pairs_Small_Stretch_Paths","abstract":"Let G = (V; E) be a weighted undirected graph withjVj = n andjEj = m. An estimate ^ (u; v) of the distance (u; v) between u; v 2 V is said to be of stretch t iff (u; v) ^ (u; v) t (u; v). Computing distances of small stretch efficiently is a well-studied problem in graph algorithms. The most efficient algorithms known here are the approximate distance oracles of (16) and the three algorithms in (9) to compute all-pairs stretch t distances for t = 2; 7=3; and 3. We present faster algorithms for these problems. For any integer k 1, Thorup and Zwick in (16) gave an O(kmn1=k) algorithm to construct a data structure of size O(kn1+1=k) to answer approximate distance queries. For a query (u; v)2 V V , the distance returned is of stretch at most 2k 1. The query answering time is O(k), which is essentially a constant since we are interested in small-stretch distances, or equivalently, small values of k. But for small values of k, the time to construct the oracle is rather high. The case k = 2 is particularly interesting and the Thorup-Zwick algorithm takes O(m p n) time, which could be as large as ( n5=2). Here we present an O(n2 log n) algorithm to construct such a data structure of size O(kn1+1=k) for all integers k 2. Our query answering time is O(k) for k > 2 and (log n) for k = 2. We obtain these results with a new generic scheme for all-pairs approximate shortest paths. Using this scheme, we also improve the running time of the fastest all-pairs stretch 2 distances algorithm from ~ O(m1=2n3=2) to ~","authors":["Surender Baswana","Telikepalli Kavitha"],"meta":["October 2006Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2006.29","SourceDBLP","Conference: 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2006), 21-24 October 2006, Berkeley, California, USA, Proceedings"],"references":["239321680_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_in_Expected_On2_Time","226461725_All-Pairs_Nearly_2-Approximate_Shortest-Paths_in_On2_polylog_n_Time","225345380_A_Simple_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Computing_a_2k-_1-Spanner_of_On11k_Size_in_Weighted_Graphs","222985611_All-Pairs_Small-Stretch_Paths","241928380_A_Simple_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Computing_a_2k-1Spanner_of_On11k_Size_in_Weighted_Graphs","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","225636685_All-Pairs_Shortest_Paths_with_Real_Weights_in_On3log_n_Time","222963965_A_new_approach_to_all-pairs_shortest_paths_on_real-weighted_graphs","221344130_Computing_almost_shortest_paths","220778959_Approximate_distance_oracles_for_unweighted_graphs_in_On","220618199_Near-Linear_Time_Construction_of_Sparse_Neighborhood_Covers","47841901_All-pairs_nearly_2-approximate_shortest_paths_in_On2_mathrm_polylog_n_time","220616824_Fast_Estimation_of_Diameter_and_Shortest_Paths_Without_Matrix_Multiplication","4355284_Storing_a_Sparse_Table_with_01_Worst_Case_Access_Time","3593541_Fast_Algorithms_for_Constructing_t-Spanners_and_Paths_with_Stretch_t"]}
