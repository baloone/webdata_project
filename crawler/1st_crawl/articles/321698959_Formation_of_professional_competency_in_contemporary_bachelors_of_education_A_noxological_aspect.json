{"id":"321698959_Formation_of_professional_competency_in_contemporary_bachelors_of_education_A_noxological_aspect","abstract":"The paper deals with the problem of training the bachelors of education in life safety area which is relevant as of today. The paper presents the results of the research conducted by the authors during the time span from 2005 up to 2016 that reveal the particularities of training of bachelors of education in life safety on the basis of modular and noxological approaches. The main directions of organizing the educational process of life safety bachelors of education training based on an experimental technique are detailed. For understanding the role of the noxological aspect in a teacher's expertise, the regularities of development of the \"Life safety\" educational space (LS ES) have been determined. For assessing the noxological content of the professional competency of a life safety bachelor of education, the technique of additive and multiplicative convolution has been suggested that allows taking into account the contribution of each subject and each competence into formation of the noxological content of the professional competency. The research conducted has enabled the authors to obtain results definitely proving the efficiency of including the noxological content into the bachelors training educational process. This can be seen in a higher stability of forming of the professional competency in students of experimental groups. The question about the influence of today's complex of challenges, threats and hazards of the environment on the content of profile subject training of future life safety teachers and on formation of their professional competency remains debatable.","authors":["P.V.
