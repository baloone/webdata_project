{"id":"282927812_Robotics_engineering_program_and_curriculum_development","abstract":"Robotics, as a multi-disciplinary branch of science and technology, is concerned with a variety of computer-controlled electro-mechanical structures designed for a multitude of applications. Less than a decade ago, robotics was a graduate-level field of research in engineering & computer science offered only at a few large engineering institutions. It has now become an engineering discipline of its own with a small but increasing number of schools offering an undergraduate engineering degree in robotics engineering. This article provides an overview of new undergraduate curricula in robotics engineering and the challenges associated with its curriculum development.","authors":["Rachid Manseur"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/FIE.2014.7044426"],"references":["224557295_Mechatronic_design_of_NAO_humanoid","345928763_Integration_Of_An_Innovative_Engineering_Program_In_A_Suny_College"]}
