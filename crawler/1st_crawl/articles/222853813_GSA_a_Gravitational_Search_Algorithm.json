{"id":"222853813_GSA_a_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm","abstract":"In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions.","authors":["Esmat Rashedi","Hossein Nezamabadi-pour","Saeid Saryazdi"],"meta":["June 2009Information Sciences 179(13):2232-2248","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2009.03.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["245440213_Central_force_optimization_A_new_metaheuristic_with_applications_in_applied_electromagnetics","237815478_Heuristic_Knowledge_Discovery_for_Archaeological_Data_Using_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Rough","235439153_Ant_sytem_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","226815117_Central_Force_Optimization_A_New_Nature_Inspired_Computational_Framework_for_Multidimensional_Search_and_Optimization","220176122_Edge_detection_using_ant_algorithms","220118677_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing","6026283_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing","5589170_Ant_System_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybernetics_-_Part_B","3418509_Macready_WG_No_Free_Lunch_Theorems_for_Optimization_IEEE_Transactions_on_Evolutionary_Computation_11_67-82","3413762_Stability_Analysis_of_Social_Foraging_Swarms","3321201_Genetic_algorithms_and_their_applications","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","281296974_Heuristic_Knowledge_Discovery_for_Archaeological_Data_Using_Genetic_Algorithms_and_Rough_Sets","281266055_No_Free_Lunch_Theorems_for_Optimization","279274771_No_free_lunch_theorems_for_optimization","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","235890207_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Prentice_Hall","223734450_RETRACTED_Retraction_notice_to_Fuzzy_controller_training_using_particle_swarm_optimization_for_nonlinear_system_control","223064553_Improving_genetic_algorithms'_performance_by_local_search_for_continuous_function_optimization","222987147_A_particle_swarm_optimization_approach_to_nonlinear_rational_filter_modeling","222818065_Multi-Objective_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_with_time_variant_inertia_and_acceleration_coefficients","222780130_Ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_and_its_application_to_Neuro-Fuzzy_controller_design","222703889_A_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_and_bacterial_foraging_approach_for_global_optimization","222539881_Exchange_strategies_for_multiple_Ant_Colony_System","222497937_Effective_time_variation_of_G_in_a_model_universe_with_variable_space_dimension","222424962_A_Study_of_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Particle_Trajectories","222411068_Multi-strategy_ensemble_particle_swarm_optimization_for_dynamic_optimization","222401737_A_fast_and_accurate_approach_for_3D_image_registration_using_the_scatter_search_evolutionary_algorithm","221998549_A_tabu_search_approach_for_the_minimum_sum-of-squares_clustering_problem","221996750_Artificial_Intelligence_-_A_Modern_Approach","221951359_Artificial_immune_algorithm_for_IIR_filter_design","221936221_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","220742467_Fingerprint_Matching_by_Genetic_Algorithms","220423727_Swarm_Intelligence","220315012_Replacement_strategies_to_preserve_useful_diversity_in_steady-state_genetic_algorithms","220313427_A_proof_of_convergence_for_Ant_algorithms","220045419_Robust_PID_controller_tuning_based_on_the_constrained_particle_swarm_optimization","215930297_Fundamentals_of_Physics","201976202_The_Immune_System_Adaptation_and_Machine_Learning","37405956_Practical_Genetic_Algorithms","27260978_Gravity_from_the_Ground_Up","24203009_Retraction_notice_to_Fuzzy_controller_training_using_particle_swarm_optimization_for_nonlinear_system_control","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization","3418569_Evolutionary_Programming_Made_Faster","3217198_Genetic_algorithms_Concepts_and_applications"]}
