{"id":"278047965_Nonlinear_Frames_and_Sparse_Reconstructions_in_Banach_Spaces","abstract":"In the first part of this paper, we consider nonlinear extension of frame\ntheory by introducing bi-Lipschitz maps $F$ between Banach spaces. Our linear\nmodel of bi-Lipschitz maps is the analysis operator associated with Hilbert\nframes, $p$-frames, Banach frames, g-frames and fusion frames. In general\nBanach space setting, stable algorithm to reconstruct a signal $x$ from its\nnoisy measurement $F(x)+\\epsilon$ may not exist. In this paper, we establish\nexponential convergence of two iterative reconstruction algorithms when $F$ is\nnot too far from some bounded below linear operator with bounded\npseudo-inverse, and when $F$ is a well-localized map between two Banach spaces\nwith dense Hilbert subspaces. The crucial step to prove the later conclusion is\na novel fixed point theorem for a well-localized map on a Banach space.\nIn the second part of this paper, we consider stable reconstruction of sparse\nsignals in a union ${\\bf A}$ of closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space\n${\\bf H}$ from their nonlinear measurements. We create an optimization\nframework called sparse approximation triple $({\\bf A}, {\\bf M}, {\\bf H})$, and\nshow that the minimizer $$x^*={\\rm argmin}_{\\hat x\\in {\\mathbf M}\\ {\\rm with} \\\n\\|F(\\hat x)-F(x^0)\\|\\le \\epsilon} \\|\\hat x\\|_{\\mathbf M}$$ provides a\nsuboptimal approximation to the original sparse signal $x^0\\in {\\bf A}$ when\nthe measurement map $F$ has the sparse Riesz property and almost linear\nproperty on ${\\mathbf A}$. The above two new properties is also discussed in\nthis paper when $F$ is not far away from a linear measurement operator $T$\nhaving the restricted isometry property.","authors":["Qiyu Sun","Wai-Shing Tang"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications 23(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00041-016-9501-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["318579097_Does_lp-minimization_outperform_l1-minimization","270905738_Does_ell_p-minimization_outperform_ell_1-minimization","344552624_Symmetry_and_inverse-closedness_of_matrix_algebras_and_functional_calculus_for_infinite_matrices","325540567_An_introduction_to_frames_and_riesz_bases","325514029_A_mathematical_introduction_to_compressive_sensing","319394185_Foundations_of_Modern_Analysis","311600937_Injectivity_in_banach_spaces_and_the_mazur-ulam_theorem_on_isometries","275982075_Foundations_of_Modern_Analysis","266619383_Sampling_and_Galerkin_reconstruction_in_reproducing_kernel_spaces","266276770_Differential_Banach_Algebra_Norms_and_Smooth_Subalgebras_of_C-algcbras","265069795_Wiener's_lemma_Pictures_at_an_exhibition","259633349_Rate_of_Innovation_for_Non-Periodic_Signals_and_Optimal_Lower_Stability_Bound_for_Filtering","265575276_A_Mathematical_Introduction_to_Compressive_Sensing","265330862_Greedy_approximation","260637143_A_Theory_for_Sampling_Signals_From_a_Union_of_Subspaces"]}
