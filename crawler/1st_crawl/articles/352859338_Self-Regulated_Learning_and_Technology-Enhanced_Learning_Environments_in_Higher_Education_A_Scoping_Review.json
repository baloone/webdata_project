{"id":"352859338_Self-Regulated_Learning_and_Technology-Enhanced_Learning_Environments_in_Higher_Education_A_Scoping_Review","abstract":"This paper seeks to identify the characteristics of studies of self-regulated learning that consider the use of technology-enriched environments in higher education. To this end, a review was conducted of the scientific literature during the period 2015–2021 in various scientific databases. The analysis identified 42 research papers that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that this topic has been gaining interest among researchers and the main strategies developed to self-regulate students in academic virtual environments. On the other hand, classical self-regulated learning models underpin most of the studies reviewed; Zimmermann’s approaches, or those derived from his work, are the most frequent. As regards the methodology adopted, the preferred focus is quantitative; the questionnaire is the most used for data collection. Most of the research was carried out with students studying for different university degrees; the most-analysed technology tools were LMS platforms.","authors":["Santos Urbina","Sofía Villatoro","Jesus Salinas"],"meta":["June 2021Sustainability 13(13):7281","DOI:10.3390/su13137281"],"references":["335942589_Can_a_brief_digital_skill_training_intervention_help_undergraduates_learn_to_learn_and_improve_their_STEM_achievement","335403027_MOOC-based_flipped_learning_in_higher_education_students'_participation_experience_and_learning_performance","335252810_Profiling_self-regulation_behaviors_in_STEM_learning_of_engineering_design","333138161_What_changes_and_for_whom_A_study_of_the_impact_of_learning_analytics-based_process_feedback_in_a_large_course","333091837_Perception_and_Attitude_Toward_Self-Regulated_Learning_of_Thailand's_Students_in_Educational_Data_Mining_Perspective","333007578_Process_mining_for_self-regulated_learning_assessment_in_e-learning","332540554_Self-regulated_learning_for_web-enhanced_control_engineering_education","345260107_Self-regulation_and_emotion_matter_A_case_study_of_instructor_interactions_with_a_learning_analytics_dashboard","342428845_Promoting_individual_and_group_regulation_through_social_connection_strategies_for_remote_learning","342249352_Characterizing_Learners'_Engagement_in_MOOCs_An_Observational_Case_Study_Using_the_NoteMyProgress_Tool_for_Supporting_Self-Regulation"]}
