{"id":"347439798_An_Interactive_Serious_Mobile_Game_for_Supporting_the_Learning_of_Programming_in_JavaScript_in_the_Context_of_Eco-Friendly_City_Management","abstract":"In the pedagogical process, a serious game acts as a method of teaching and upbringing, the transfer of accumulated experience and knowledge. In this paper, we describe an interactive serious programming game based on game-based learning for teaching JavaScript programming in an introductory course at university. The game was developed by adopting the gamification pattern-based approach. The game is based on visualizations of different types of algorithms, which are interpreted in the context of city life. The game encourages interactivity and pursues deeper learning of programming concepts. The results of the evaluation of the game using pre-test and post-test knowledge assessment, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) are presented.","authors":["Rytis Maskeliunas","Audrius Kulikajevas","Tomas Blazauskas","Robertas Damasevicius"],"meta":["December 2020Computers 9(102):102","DOI:10.3390/computers9040102"],"references":["345810336_Rethinking_Serious_Games_Design_in_the_Age_of_COVID-19_Setting_the_Focus_on_Wicked_Problems","341399089_Paper-A_Systematic_Review_on_Open_Educational_Games_for_Programming_Learning_and_Teaching_A_Systematic_Review_on_Open_Educational_Games_for_Programming_Learning_and_Teaching","349583102_Co-Creativity_through_Play_and_Game_Design_Thinking","343969988_The_Use_Of_Game_Technologies_In_Primary_Education","343085892_The_impact_of_gamification_in_educational_settings_on_student_learning_outcomes_a_meta-analysis","342931103_Gaming_in_the_Time_of_COVID-19","342604904_Game_On_Investigating_Digital_Game-Based_Versus_Gamified_Learning_in_Higher_Education","342392091_Designing_a_Programming_Game_to_Improve_Children's_Procedural_Abstraction_Skills_in_Scratch","340494676_A_Serious_Game_for_Teaching_Python_Programming_Language","340466819_To_learn_scientifically_effectively_and_enjoyably_A_review_of_educational_games"]}
