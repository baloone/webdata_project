{"id":"271613678_Laser-induced_fluorescence_study_of_medieval_frescoes_by_Giusto_de'_Menabuoi","abstract":"Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a powerful remote and non-invasive analysis technique that has been successfully applied to the real-time diagnosis of historical artworks. Hyperspectral images collection on fresco's and their false colours processing allowed to reveal features invisible to the naked eye and to obtain specific information on pigments composition and consolidants utilization, the latter also related to former restorations. This report presents the results obtained by ENEA LIF scanning system during a field campaign conducted in June 2010 on fresco's by Giusto deâ€™ Menabuoi in the Padua Baptistery. The data collected by LidArt allowed the detection of Paraloid B72 and Movilith/Primal AC33, guiding the restorers in their conservation actions.","authors":["Roberta Fantoni","L.
