{"id":"311769497_A_Singular_Mathematical_Promenade","abstract":"This is neither an elementary introduction to singularity theory nor a specialized treatise containing many new theorems. The purpose of this little book is to invite the reader on a mathematical promenade. We will pay a visit to Hipparchus, Newton and Gauss, but also to many contemporary mathematicians. We will play with a bit of algebra, topology, geometry, complex analysis and computer science. Hopefully, some motivated undergraduates and some more advanced mathematicians will enjoy some of these panoramas.","authors":["Etienne Ghys"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["50869860_Introduction_to_Vassiliev_Knot_Invariants","2594863_The_Kontsevich_Integral"]}
