{"id":"331026308_Proxemics_for_first_aid_to_unconscious_injured_person","abstract":"Nowadays, it exists a wide variety of first aid applications for android and iOS devices to help users in unexpected or dangerous situations. However, their massive use is limited due to several aspects, such as the complicated user interaction or the wearing of special devices for medical identification. In order to find solutions to the problems mentioned above, we have adopted an approach based on proxemic interaction. In this context, we propose a First Aid Mobile Application (FAMA) based on Proxemic-interaction and developed with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon technology. In the first evaluation, we describe the technical aspects and challenges related with the development of FAMA. The results demonstrate the benefit of using proxemic interaction to implement HCI, in the context of emergency and rescue services, in terms of better performance and accessibility, compared with existing first aid mobile applications.","authors":["Paulo PÃ©rez","Philippe Roose","Dalmau Marc","Nadine Couture"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1145/3286689.3286712","Conference: the 30th Conference"],"references":["324670342_Change_Blindness_in_Proximity-Aware_Mobile_Interfaces","319938583_ProximiThings_Implementing_Proxemic_Interactions_in_the_Internet_of_Things","300484305_Interaction_Proxemics_Combining_Physical_Spaces_for_Seamless_Gesture_Interaction","260589542_Collaboration_surrounding_beacon_use_during_companion_avalanche_rescue","239761322_Interaction_Proxemics_and_Image_Use_in_Neurosurgery","221015912_MirrorSpace_Using_Proximity_as_an_Interface_to_Video-Mediated_Communication","220876930_The_Proximity_Toolkit_Prototyping_Proxemic_Interactions_in_Ubiquitous_Computing_Ecologies","51019513_How_smartphones_are_changing_the_face_of_mobile_and_participatory_healthcare_An_overview_with_example_from_eCAALYX","12371846_Cross-Cultural_Differences_in_Tolerance_for_Crowding_Fact_or_Fiction","316722063_GuideBeacon_Beacon-based_indoor_wayfinding_for_the_blind_visually_impaired_and_disoriented","299872362_Proxemic-Aware_Controls","220877092_Interactive_public_ambient_displays_Transitioning_from_implicit_to_explicit_public_to_personal_interaction_with_multiple_users"]}
