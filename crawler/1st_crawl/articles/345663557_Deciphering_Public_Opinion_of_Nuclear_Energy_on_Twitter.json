{"id":"345663557_Deciphering_Public_Opinion_of_Nuclear_Energy_on_Twitter","abstract":"This paper explores nuclear energy-related Twitter discussions as a response to the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster and the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize won by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. We have considered a total of 2 million tweets for these two events. In particular, we employed CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM to investigate whether social media users are supportive or cynical about nuclear energy. Our AI algorithms have performed better for polarity detection (accuracy in the range of 90%) with respect to subjectivity detection (accuracy in the range of 75%). We also note that dominant aspects of supporting tweets revolve around concepts like clean energy, lower CO2 emission, and sustainable future. On the contrary, cynical users see nuclear energy as a threat to the environment, human life, and safety.","authors":["Aparup Khatua","Erik Cambria","Shirley S Ho","Jin Cheon"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206903","Conference: IJCNN"],"references":["334439285_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Image_Polarity_Detection_Balancing_Generalization_Performances_and_Computational_Costs","329731850_Harnessing_Twitter_Data_for_Analyzing_Public_Reactions_to_Transportation_Policies_Evidences_from_the_Odd-Even_Policy_in_Delhi_India","323627297_Targeted_Aspect-Based_Sentiment_Analysisvia_Embedding_Commonsense_Knowledge_into_an_Attentive_LSTM","322512000_Subjectivity_Detection_in_Nuclear_Energy_Tweets","333537517_Limits_to_deployment_of_nuclear_power_for_decarbonization_Insights_from_public_opinion","332769127_Fuzzy_commonsense_reasoning_for_multimodal_sentiment_analysis","330365104_Cognitive-inspired_domain_adaptation_of_sentiment_lexicons","330050906_A_tale_of_two_epidemics_Contextual_Word2Vec_for_classifying_twitter_streams_during_outbreaks","326029224_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Microblogs_for_Natural_Disasters_Management_a_Study_on_the_2014_Genoa_Floodings","322005172_Distinguishing_Between_Facts_and_Opinions_for_Sentiment_Analysis_Survey_and_Challenges"]}
