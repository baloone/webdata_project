{"id":"326520056_Narrative_and_active_video_game_in_separate_and_additive_effects_of_physical_activity_and_cognitive_function_among_young_adults","abstract":"Physically active video games (AVGs) have been found to positively impact physical activity behaviors, especially when a narrative is added. However, the motivational and cognitive benefits of adding narrative to AVG are unclear. We examined the separate and additive effects of narrative and AVG on physical activity and cognitive function versus an active comparator, such as a sedentary video game (SVG). We randomly assigned young adults to one of four groups (narrative-AVG, AVG, narrative-SVG, or SVG) and had them complete sustained attention and working memory tasks before and after a 30-min experimental condition. Participants in both narrative-AVG and AVG groups achieved a moderate-intensity physical activity, while adding narrative to AVG resulted in higher step counts and more time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than AVG without narrative. Regardless of the narrative effect, participants in both AVG groups performed better on overall working memory than both SVG groups, while both AVG and SVG groups similarly achieved maximal performance in sustained attention. Working memory enhancement was positively correlated with increased heart rate. Participants in narrative-SVG group had a better response accuracy in working memory than those who played SVG without narrative. Taken together, adding narrative to AVG as a motivational component increased physical activity, which was the primary factor in the improvement of overall working memory.","authors":["Jungyun Hwang","Amy S.
