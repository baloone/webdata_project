{"id":"288667578_Universities-industry_collaboration_A_systematic_review","abstract":"The collaboration between universities and the industry is increasingly perceived as\na vehicle to enhance innovation through knowledge exchange. This is evident by a significant\nincrease in studies that investigate the topic from different perspectives. However, this body of\nknowledge is still described as fragmented and lacks efficient comprehensive view. To address this\ngap, we employed a systematic procedure to review the literature on universitiesâ€”industry\ncollaboration (UIC). The review resulted in identifying five key aspects, which underpinned the\ntheory of UIC. We integrate these key aspects into an overarching process framework, which\ntogether with the review, provide a substantial contribution by creating an integrated analysis of\nthe state of literature concerning this phenomenon. Several research avenues are reported as\ndistilled from the analysis.","authors":["Samuel Ankrah","Omar Al-Tabbaa"],"meta":["January 2016Scandinavian Journal of Management 31(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.scaman.2015.02.003"],"references":["324525309_A_Stakeholder_Approach_to_Strategic_Management","324309882_Complex_Organizations_A_Critical_Essay","314149134_Institutional_Theories_Of_Organization","303854826_J_Social_capital_intellectual_capital_and_the_organizational_advantage","303166395_January-February_Creating_Shared_Value","293655596_Mid-range_universities'_linkages_with_industry_Knowledge_types_and_the_role_of_intermediaries","287650310_Keeping_secrets_in_the_campus_lab_Law_values_and_rules_of_engagement_for_industry-university_RD_partnerships","285680969_Strategic_Management_A_Stakholder_Approach","285374489_Harvard_Business_Review","285280212_Partnering_for_knowledge_A_learning_framework_for_university-industry_collaboration"]}
