{"id":"323026923_The_Higher-Order_Prover_Leo-III","abstract":"The automated theorem prover Leo-III for classical higher-order logic with Henkin semantics and choice is presented. Leo-III is based on extensional higher-order paramodulation and accepts every common TPTP dialect (FOF, TFF, THF), including their recent extensions to rank-1 polymorphism (TF1, TH1). In addition, the prover natively supports almost every normal higher-order modal logic. Leo-III cooperates with first-order reasoning tools using translations to (polymorphic) many-sorted first-order logic and produces verifiable proof certificates. The prover is evaluated on heterogeneous benchmark sets.","authors":["Alexander Steen","Christoph Benzm√ºller"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: LEO-III"],"references":["313833898_The_TPTP_Problem_Library_and_Associated_Infrastructure_From_CNF_to_TH0_TPTP_v640","280986731_The_Higher-Order_Prover_Leo-II","260000943_Automation_of_Higher-Order_Logic","228917568_Building_a_Problem_Library_for_First-Order_Modal_Logics","220245144_Multimodal_and_intuitionistic_logics_in_simple_type_theory","49595291_Automated_Reasoning_in_Higher-Order_Logic_using_the_TPTP_THF_Infrastructure","2627717_MSPASS_Modal_Reasoning_by_Translation_and_First-Order_Resolution","267123039_MleanCoP_A_Connection_Prover_for_First-Order_Modal_Logic","262208957_The_Tableau_Prover_Generator_MetTeL2","50852994_Handbook_of_Modal_Logic"]}
