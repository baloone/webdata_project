{"id":"263056993_Topology_of_the_immediate_snapshot_complexes","abstract":"The immediate snapshot complexes were introduced as combinatorial models for\nthe protocol complexes in the context of theoretical distributed computing. In\nthe previous work we have developed a~formal language of witness structures in\norder to define and to analyze these complexes.\nIn this paper, we study topology of immediate snapshot complexes. It was\nknown that these complexes are always pure and that they are pseudomanifolds.\nHere we prove two further independent topological properties. First, we show\nthat immediate snapshot complexes are collapsible. Second, we show that these\ncomplexes are homeomorphic to closed balls. Specifically, given any immediate\nsnapshot complex $P(\\tr)$, we show that there exists a homeomorphism\n$\\varphi:\\da^{|\\supp\\tr|-1}\\ra P(\\tr)$, such that $\\varphi(\\sigma)$ is a\nsubcomplex of $P(\\tr)$, whenever $\\sigma$ is a simplex in the simplicial\ncomplex $\\da^{|\\supp\\tr|-1}$.","authors":["Dmitry N.
