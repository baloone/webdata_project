{"id":"267121476_Random_triangulations_of_planar_points_sets","abstract":"Given a set S of n points in the plane, a triangulation is a maximal crossing-free geometric graph on S (in a geometric graph the edges are realized by straight line segments). Here we consider random triangulations, where “random” refers to uniformly at random from the set of all triangulations of S. We are primarily interested in the degree sequences of such random triangulations.","authors":["E. Welzl"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
