{"id":"314701726_Cryptanalysis_of_the_McEliece_Public_Key_Cryptosystem_Based_on_Polar_Codes","abstract":"Polar codes discovered by Arikan form a very powerful family of codes attaining many information theoretic limits in the fields of error correction and source coding. They have in particular much better decoding capabilities than Goppa codes which places them as a serious alternative in the design of both a public-key encryption scheme Ã  la McEliece and a very efficient signature scheme. Shrestha and Kim proposed in 2014 to use them in order to come up with a new code-based public key cryptosystem. We present a key-recovery attack that makes it possible to recover a description of the permuted polar code providing all the information required for decrypting any message.","authors":["Magali Bardet","Julia Chaulet","Vlad-Florin Dragoi","Ayoub Otmani"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-29360-8_9","Conference: International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography"],"references":["304341633_Polynomial_Time_Attack_on_Wild_McEliece_Over_Quadratic_Extensions","296573348_On_minimum_distance_decoding_of_linear_codes","281329354_Algebraic_Attack_against_Variants_of_McEliece_with_Goppa_Polynomial_of_a_Special_Form","314692926_Analysis_of_Information_Set_Decoding_for_a_Sub-linear_Error_Weight","286569892_Reducing_the_key_length_of_mceliece_cryptosystem_using_polar_codes","281765501_New_McEliece_cryptosystem_based_on_polar_codes_as_a_candidate_for_post-quantum_cryptography","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","278734641_On_the_Design_of_Code-Based_Signatures","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","273130028_The_Theory_of_Error-Correcting_Codes"]}
