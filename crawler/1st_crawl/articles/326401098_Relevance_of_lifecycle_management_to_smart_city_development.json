{"id":"326401098_Relevance_of_lifecycle_management_to_smart_city_development","abstract":"Smart cities are complex ecosystems with interrelated systems or system of systems. Hence, management of smart cities is very important due to the big number of stakeholders, diversity of application domains, heterogeneity of data sources, and complexity of smart systems. Nevertheless, less studies have considered management aspect of smart cities compared to other technical aspects. Considering the different phases of smart city development, there is a need for comprehensive vision to manage smart city across lifecycle phases. This work proposes a smart city lifecycle-based approach which consists of two components. First, lifecycle-based representation of smart cities by adding the depth of “Time” as a new dimension. Second, interaction approach between lifecycle management system and IoT platforms. For this purpose, this paper examines the empirical relevance of lifecycle management to smart city development through a limited case-based survey.","authors":["Ahmed Hefnawy","Abdelaziz Bouras","Chantal Cherifi"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Product Development 22(5):351","DOI:10.1504/IJPD.2018.10014761","Project: Relevance of Lifecycle Management to Smart City Development"],"references":["314868101_Lifecycle_Management_in_the_Smart_City_Context_Smart_Parking_Use-Case","310742877_IoT-based_Smart_Parking_System_for_Sporting_Event_Management","304704482_A_Unified_Smart_City_Model_USCM_for_Smart_City_Conceptualization_and_Benchmarking","283438766_Integration_of_Smart_City_and_Lifecycle_Concepts_for_Enhanced_Large-Scale_Event_Management","277958808_Defining_Smart_City_Architecture_for_Sustainability","276457481_Big_Data_in_product_lifecycle_management","276119099_Conceptual_foundations_for_understanding_smart_tourism_ecosystems","267865961_Addressing_the_Complexity_of_Distributed_Smart_City_Systems_by_Utilization_of_Model_Driven_Engineering_Concepts","318743466_Smart_City_and_IoT","309087818_A_PLM_components_monitoring_framework_for_SMEs_based_on_a_PLM_maturity_model_and_FAHP_methodology"]}
