{"id":"275280030_Efficient_Vertex-Label_Distance_Oracles_for_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"We consider distance queries in vertex labeled planar graphs. For any fixed\n$0 < \\epsilon \\leq 1/2$ we show how to preprocess a planar graph with vertex\nlabels and edge lengths into a data structure that answers queries of the\nfollowing form. Given a vertex $u$ and a label $\\lambda$ return a\n$(1+O(\\epsilon))$-approximation of the distance between $u$ and its closest\nvertex with label $\\lambda$. For an undirected $n$-vertex planar graph the\npreprocessing time is $O(\\epsilon^{-2}n\\lg^{3}{n})$, the size is\n$O(\\epsilon^{-1}n\\lg{n})$, and the query time is $O(\\lg\\lg{n} +\n\\epsilon^{-1})$. For a directed planar graph with arc lengths bounded by $N$,\nthe preprocessing time is $O(\\epsilon^{-2}n\\lg^{3}{n}\\lg(nN))$, the data\nstructure size is $O(\\epsilon^{-1}n\\lg{n}\\lg(nN))$, and the query time is\n$O(\\lg\\lg{n}\\lg\\lg(nN) + \\epsilon^{-1})$.","authors":["Shay Mozes","Eyal E.
