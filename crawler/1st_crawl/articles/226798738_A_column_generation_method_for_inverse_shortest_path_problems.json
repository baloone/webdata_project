{"id":"226798738_A_column_generation_method_for_inverse_shortest_path_problems","abstract":"In this paper we formulate an inverse shortest path problem as a special linear programming problem. A column generation scheme is developed that is able to keep most columns of the LP model implicit and to generate necessary columns by shortest path algorithms. This method can get an optimal solution in finitely many steps. Some numerical results are reported to show that the algorithm has a good performance.","authors":["Jian zhong Zhang","Zhongfan Ma","Chao Yang"],"meta":["October 1995Mathematical Methods of Operations Research 41(3):347-358","DOI:10.1007/BF01432364"],"references":["220695898_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Complexity","2581434_The_Inverse_Shortest_Paths_Problem_With_Upper_Bounds_on_Shortest_Paths_Costs","292519411_Linear_programming_and_network_flows_Fourth_edition","265449930_Linear_Programming_and_Network_Flows","243530145_Optimization_Theory_For_Large_Systems","226839939_On_the_Use_of_an_Inverse_Shortest_Paths_Algorithm_for_Recovering_Linearly_Correlated_Costs","225221814_On_an_Instance_of_the_Inverse_Shortest_Paths_Problem","225218393_An_inverse_problem_of_the_weighted_shortest_path_problem","225136534_A_numerically_stable_dual_method_for_solving_strictly_convex_quadratic_programs"]}
