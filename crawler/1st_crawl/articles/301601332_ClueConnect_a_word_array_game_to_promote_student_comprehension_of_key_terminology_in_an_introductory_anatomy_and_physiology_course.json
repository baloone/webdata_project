{"id":"301601332_ClueConnect_a_word_array_game_to_promote_student_comprehension_of_key_terminology_in_an_introductory_anatomy_and_physiology_course","abstract":"The sheer amount of terminology and conceptual knowledge required for anatomy and physiology can be overwhelming for students. Educational games are one approach to reinforce such knowledge. In this activity, students worked collaboratively to review anatomy and physiology concepts by creating arrays of descriptive tiles to define a term. Once guessed, students located the structure or process within diagrams of the body. The game challenged students to think about course vocabulary in novel ways and to use their collective knowledge to get their classmates to guess the terms. Comparison of pretest/posttest/delayed posttest data revealed that students achieved statistically significant learning gains for each unit after playing the game, and a survey of student perceptions demonstrated that the game was helpful for learning vocabulary as well as fun to play. The game is easily adaptable for a variety of lower- and upper-division courses.","authors":["Kathy Burleson","Jeffrey T Olimpo"],"meta":["June 2016AJP Advances in Physiology Education 40(2):223-228","DOI:10.1152/advan.00106.2015"],"references":["276063490_The_Biology_Experimental_Design_Challenge_An_Interactive_Approach_to_Enhance_Students'_Understanding_of_Scientific_Inquiry_in_the_Context_of_an_Introductory_Biology_Course","270656944_A_Board_Game_for_Undergraduate_Genetics_Vocabulary_and_Concept_Review_The_Pathway_Shuffle","265216595_Playing_games_during_a_lecture_hour_Experience_with_an_online_blood_grouping_game","262267588_Active_Learning_Increases_Student_Performance_in_Science_Engineering_and_Mathematics","258848031_Long-term_understanding_of_basic_science_knowledge_in_senior_medical_students","333190279_Qualitative_research_Analysis_types_and_software_tools","279004260_Cognitive_Conceptions_of_Learning","272520658_Improvements_from_a_Flipped_Classroom_May_Simply_Be_the_Fruits_of_Active_Learning","259851326_Playing_games_during_a_lecture_hour_Experience_with_an_online_blood_grouping_game","259558314_Active_Learning_for_the_College_Classroom"]}
