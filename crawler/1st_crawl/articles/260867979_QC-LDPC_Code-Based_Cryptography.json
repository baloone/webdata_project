{"id":"260867979_QC-LDPC_Code-Based_Cryptography","abstract":"This book describes the fundamentals of cryptographic primitives based on quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes, with special focus on the use of these codes in public-key cryptosystems derived from the McEliece and Niederreiter schemes.\nIn the first part of the book, the main characteristics of QC-LDPC codes are reminded, and several techniques for their design are presented. The tools for assessing the error correction performance of these codes are also described. Some families of QC-LDPC codes which are best suited for the use in cryptography are also presented.\nThe second part of the book focuses on the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems, both in their original forms and in some subsequent variants. The applicability of QC-LDPC codes in these frameworks is investigated by means of theoretical analyses and numerical tools, in order to assess their benefits and drawbacks in terms of system efficiency and security.\nSeveral instances of QC-LDPC code-based public key cryptosystems are presented, and their advantages over classical solutions are highlighted.\nThe chance to use QC-LDPC codes also in symmetric encryption schemes and digital signature algorithms is also briefly examined.","authors":["Marco Baldi"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-02556-8","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-3-319-02555-1","Project: Code-based cryptography"],"references":["315992613_On_the_Design_of_Punctured_Low_Density_Parity_Check_Codes_for_Variable_Rate_Systems","312941065_Semantically_secure_McEliece_public-key_cryptosystems-conversions_for_McEliece_PKC","300708993_Quasi-Cyclic_Low-Density_Parity-Check_Codes","287256228_Rational_representation_of_codes_and_Lg_codes","285864922_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_McEliece_Variants_with_Compact_Keys_-_Towards_a_Complexity_Analysis","284261891_A_new_class_of_linear_error_correcting_codes","266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","265783365_Decoding_complexity_bound_for_linear_block_codes","265535122_Arithmetic_complexity_of_computations","262232903_McBits_Fast_Constant-Time_Code-Based_Cryptography","261491777_MDPC-McEliece_New_McEliece_variants_from_Moderate_Density_Parity-Check_codes","260299453_Security_and_complexity_of_the_McEliece_cryptosystem_based_on_quasi-cyclic_low-density_parity-check_codes","262164514_An_Efficient_IND-CCA2_Secure_Variant_of_the_Niederreiter_Encryption_Scheme_in_the_Standard_Model","259367521_Secure_Integration_of_Asymmetric_and_Symmetric_Encryption_Schemes","256392292_Orthogonal_circulant_matrices_over_finite_fields_and_how_to_find_them"]}
