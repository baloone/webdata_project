{"id":"296951072_A_post-jungian_personality_theory","abstract":"Post-Jungian personality theory starts historically with the addition of P and J attitudes to Jung's E/I attitude and the psychological functions S/N and T/F to generate the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [7]. Next came [13] replacement of the coupled attitudes P and J by new decoupled attitudes Ep/Ip associated only with Jung's perception functions S and N, and Ej/Ij associated only with the judgment functions T and F. This decoupling led to rigorous quantified analysis using the MBTI scores to generate scores for Jung's cognitive modes [14]. The decoupled attitude and mode scores together make possible the identification of team roles previously defined to assign people to teams [12], now usable for individual personality description. A person can have as many as three adjacent roles in each domain, perception and judgment, at most six out of sixteen. Since existing personality theories, Jung's as well as Myers', specify exactly two roles per domain, post-Jungian descriptions are often more complete. A recent book [15] tells how to do this with previous formulas. Fortunately, a newer theory developed here shows that this computation is not needed to determine the roles. A proposed ranking of the questionnaire variables by the scores [9] is easily modified by replacing the original coupled attitudes E/I and P/J with the new decoupled attitudes Ep/Ip and Ej/Ij. Grouping the four variables into a pair for each domain, and ranking the two in each pair, is enough to determine the roles, provided the score differences and sums are recognized. More than a fixed difference of the range indicates three roles; otherwise there are two or fewer. Post-Jungian theory fills the gap left by the failure of earlier theories to project the MBTI scores correctly onto Jung's original theory [8].","authors":["D.J.
