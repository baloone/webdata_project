{"id":"282244909_Operon_structure_and_cotranslational_subunit_association_direct_protein_assembly_in_bacteria","abstract":"Assembly of protein complexes is considered a posttranslational process involving random collision of subunits. We show that\nwithin the Escherichia coli cytosol, bacterial luciferase subunits LuxA and LuxB assemble into complexes close to the site of subunit synthesis. Assembly\nefficiency decreases markedly if subunits are synthesized on separate messenger RNAs from genes integrated at distant chromosomal\nsites. Subunit assembly initiates cotranslationally on nascent LuxB in vivo. The ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor\ndelays the onset of cotranslational interactions until the LuxB dimer interface is fully exposed. Protein assembly is thus\ndirectly coupled to the translation process and involves spatially confined, actively chaperoned cotranslational subunit interactions.\nBacterial gene organization into operons therefore reflects a fundamental cotranslational mechanism for spatial and temporal\nregulation that is vital to effective assembly of protein complexes.","authors":["Yu-Wei Shieh","Pablo Minguez","Peer Bork","Josef J Auburger"],"meta":["September 2015Science 350(6261)","DOI:10.1126/science.aac8171"],"references":["234823339_Formation_of_Protein-Complexes_in_crowded_environments_From_in_vitro_to_in_vivo","23803964_Dynamic_map_of_protein_interactions_in_the_Escherichia_coli_chemotaxis_pathway","14453943_Structure_of_bacterial_luciferase","13588459_Deriving_ribosomal_binding_site_RBS_statistical_models_from_unannotated_DNA_sequences_and_the_use_of_the_RBS_model_for_N-terminal_prediction","11757634_Conditional-Replication_Integration_Excision_and_Retrieval_Plasmid-Host_Systems_for_Gene_Structure-Function_Studies_of_Bacteria","258055789_Selective_ribosome_profiling_as_a_tool_for_studying_the_interaction_of_chaperones_and_targeting_factors_with_nascent_polypeptide_chains_and_ribosomes","222439347_Jacob_F_Monod_J_Genetic_regulatory_mechanisms_in_the_synthesis_of_proteins_J_Mol_Biol_3_318-356","51863289_Selective_Ribosome_Profiling_Reveals_the_Cotranslational_Chaperone_Action_of_Trigger_Factor_In_Vivo","47428394_Genome-Wide_Translational_Profiling_by_Ribosome_Footprinting","23639297_Translational_Coupling_Controls_Expression_and_Function_of_the_DrrAB_Drug_Efflux_Pump","22827055_54_Bacterial_luciferase_FMNH2-aldehyde_oxidase","22367763_Transposition_and_fusion_of_the_lac_genes_to_selected_promoters_in_Escherichia_coli_using_bacteriophage_lambda_and_Mu","20577277_Polycistronic_mRNAs_code_for_the_Vibrio_harveyi_luminescence_system","18562483_Culture_Medium_for_Enterobacteria","15215484_Protein_disaggregation_mediated_by_heat-shock_protein_Hsp104","14162007_Kinetic_Mechanism_of_Luciferase_Subunit_Folding_and_Assembly","11380884_Zacharias_DA_Violin_JD_Newton_AC_Tsien_RY_Partioning_of_lipid-modified_monomeric_GFPs_into_membrane_microdomains_of_live_cells_Science_296_913-916","6928882_Determinants_of_chemoreceptor_cluster_formation_in_Escherichia_coli","6228877_In_Vivo_Measurement_by_FRET_of_Pathway_Activity_in_Bacterial_Chemotaxis","5893372_A_Versatile_Nanotrap_for_Biochemical_and_Functional_Studies_with_Fluorescent_Fusion_Proteins"]}
