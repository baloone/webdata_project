Problem: In this paper, a study is done by considering different data anomalies in IoT that indicates a cyber-attack, which are further fed into dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA and processed using ANN.","authors":["Mounicasri Valavala","Ripon Datta","Md Haris Uddin Sharif"],"meta":["September 2019Journal of Environmental Science, Computer Science and Engineering & Technology 8(4):251-257","DOI:10.24214/jecet.B.8.4."],"references":["327985602_An_Ensemble_Approach_to_Big_Data_Security_Cyber_Security","326929378_IoT_Challenges_and_Issues_in_Indian_Perspective","321983640_Handwritten_digits_recognition_with_artificial_neural_network","332049158_Physical_Access_System_Security_of_IoT_Devices_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","327635447_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_via_Machine_Learning_A_Survey","317757059_Internet_of_Things_and_Data_Analytics_Handbook","316448256_Using_machine_learning_to_secure_IoT_systems","313163124_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers"]}
