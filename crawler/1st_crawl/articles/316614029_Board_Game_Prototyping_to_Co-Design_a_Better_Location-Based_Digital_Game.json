{"id":"316614029_Board_Game_Prototyping_to_Co-Design_a_Better_Location-Based_Digital_Game","abstract":"In this case study we describe the iterative process of paper prototyping, using a board game, to co-design a location-based mobile application. The end goal of the application is to motivate reflection on historical topics about migration. The board game serves to capture the core concerns of this application by simulating movement through the city. Three play tests highlighted the users' interest and issues with the historical content, the way this content is represented, and the players' responses to the interactions and motivating mechanisms of the application. Results show that the board game helped capture important design preferences and problems, ensuring the improvement of our scenario. This feedback can help reduce development effort and implement a future technology prototype closer to the needs of our end users.","authors":["Catherine Emma Jones","Antonios Liapis","Ioanna Lykourentzou","Daniele Guido"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1145/3027063.3053348","Conference: the 2017 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts","Project: crosscult"],"references":["271225341_Adapting_Museum_Visitors_as_Participants_Benefits_their_Learning_Experience","266656543_Using_gamification_to_inspire_new_citizen_science_volunteers","265145508_Museums_for_visitors_Audience_development_-A_crucial_role_for_successful_museum_management_strategies","264637700_Measuring_flow_in_gamification_Dispositional_Flow_Scale-2","260186375_Exploring_Heritage_through_time_and_space_supporting_community_reflection_on_the_highland_clearances","257716487_Observation_of_Object_Preferences_of_Interest_by_Children_Aged_Between_4_and_8_in_Museums_Antalya_Museum_Examples","221248065_Design_and_evaluation_of_player_experience_of_a_location-based_mobile_game","220982363_Believable_environments_generating_interactive_storytelling_in_vast_location-based_pervasive_games","220663476_Mobile_game-based_learning_in_secondary_education_Engagement_motivation_and_learning_in_a_mobile_city_game","306928379_Serious_Games_Application_Examples","301663795_The_Gamification_of_Civic_Participation_Two_Experiments_in_Improving_the_Skills_of_Citizens_to_Reflect_Collectively_on_Spatial_Issues","287783712_The_Engaging_Museum_Developing_Museums_for_Visitor_Involvement","262285783_Cardboard_computers_mocking-it-up_or_hands-on_the_future","262008580_Paper_Prototyping_The_Fast_and_Easy_Way_to_Design_and_Refine_User_Interfaces","250172411_Editorial_Senses_and_the_City","237792812_A_WALK_ABOUT_THE_CITY_STALKER_THE_TRANSURBANCE_AND_THE_CITY_MAP","230854744_A_User-Centered_Theoretical_Framework_for_Meaningful_Gamification","2954249_Iterative_User_Interface_Design"]}
