The presence of an airplane is detected by the use of an ADS-B receiver. The RCS of an airplane is derived thanks to the ratio of the power of the received echo signal to the power of the received direct path signal. In practical experiments, a VOR transmitter is used as illuminator of opportunity, and a software-defined radio is used as receiver. The measured RCS will later be used to classify airplanes, in the context of ATR.","authors":["Jonathan Pisane","Sylvain Azarian","M.
