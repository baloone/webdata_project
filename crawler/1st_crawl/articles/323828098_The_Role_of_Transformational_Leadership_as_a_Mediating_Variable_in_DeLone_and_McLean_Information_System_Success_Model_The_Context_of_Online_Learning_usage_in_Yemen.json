{"id":"323828098_The_Role_of_Transformational_Leadership_as_a_Mediating_Variable_in_DeLone_and_McLean_Information_System_Success_Model_The_Context_of_Online_Learning_usage_in_Yemen","abstract":"Governments and higher education institutions around the world are placing online learning in their respective visions and policies as it has already transformed the way in which individuals learn, socialise and do business. Leadership is therefore increasingly playing a major role in the implementation and success of online learning goals. Although researchers have investigated adoption and usage of online learning in different settings, the mediation role of transformational leadership is yet to be examined using the Delone and Mclean IS success model. Data collected from 448 students in nine Yemeni public universities and the subsequent analysis employing structural equation modelling (SEM) via SmartPLS 3.0, revealed five main results: first, overall quality (system, information, and service quality) has a positive impact on transformational leadership; second, transformational leadership has a positive impact on actual usage; third, overall quality has an indirect positive effect on actual usage via transformational leadership; fourth, actual usage significantly affects user satisfaction and performance impact; and fifth, user satisfaction has a positive impact on student performance. The proposed model explains 61% of the variance in performance impact, and theoretical and practical implications are provided as well.","authors":["Adnan Aldholay","Osama Isaac","Zaini Abdullah","T.
