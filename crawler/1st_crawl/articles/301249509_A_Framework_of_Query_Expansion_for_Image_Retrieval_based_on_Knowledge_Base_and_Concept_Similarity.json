{"id":"301249509_A_Framework_of_Query_Expansion_for_Image_Retrieval_based_on_Knowledge_Base_and_Concept_Similarity","abstract":"We study several semantic concept-based query expansion and re-ranking scheme and compare different ontology-based expansion methods in image search and retrieval. To improve the query expansion efficiency and accuracy, we employ the CYC knowledge base to generate the expansion candidate concepts, while filter and rank the expansion results by calculating concept similarities using the Semantic Relatedness Metrics. Using our knowledge-based query expansion in image retrieval, the efficiency and accuracy has been improved.","authors":["Yuanfeng He","Yuanxi Li","Jiajia Lei","Clement Leung"],"meta":["April 2016Neurocomputing 204","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2015.11.102"],"references":["271374732_WordNetSimilarity","230585379_Verbs_Semantics_and_Lexical_Selection","228696322_Image_Retrieval_from_the_World_Wide_Web_Issues_Techniques_and_Systems","225187134_A_Topology-Based_Metric_for_Measuring_Term_Similarity_in_the_Gene_Ontology","221571428_Semantic_concept-based_query_expansion_and_re-ranking_for_multimedia_retrieval","221571387_Image_Annotation_by_Large-Scale_Content-based_Image_Retrieval","220875353_Translating_Images_to_Words_for_Recognizing_Objects_in_Large_Image_and_Video_Collections","220566113_A_Survey_of_Automatic_Query_Expansion_in_Information_Retrieval","220245027_Categorization_of_natural_scenes_Local_versus_global_information_and_the_role_of_color","45602012_Ontology_Driven_Query_Expansion_for_Better_Image_Retrieval","6576879_Robust_Object_Recognition_with_Cortex-Like_Mechanisms","5917920_Color_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Mean_Shift_and_Normalized_Cuts","5431822_Real-Time_Computerized_Annotation_of_Pictures","3412425_Segmentation_of_Color_Images_Using_Multiscale_Clustering_and_Graph_Theoretic_Region_Synthesis","3303886_A_Spatially_Constrained_Generative_Model_and_an_EM_Algorithm_for_Image_Segmentation","3194040_Isoperimetric_graph_partitioning_for_image_segmentation","2920137_Taxonomy_Learning_--_Factoring_the_Structure_of_a_Taxonomy_Into_a_Semantic_Classification_Decision","2903260_WordNetSimilarity_-_Measuring_the_Relatedness_of_Concepts","2477223_Word_Association_Norms_Mutual_Information_and_Lexicography","254011214_Infraredvisible_image_matching_algorithm_based_on_NSCT_and_DAISY","254011119_CYC_based_query_expansion_framework_for_effective_image_retrieval","242354127_WordNet_An_on-line_lexical_database","230302439_The_Distribution_of_Flora_in_the_Alpine_Zone","224679491_Using_Implicit_Relevane_Feedback_to_Advance_Web_Image_Search","200044309_WordNet_A_Lexical_Database_for_English","23251414_VisualRank_Applying_PageRank_to_large-scale_image_search_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell","3951570_Query_expansion_using_conceptual_fuzzy_sets_for_search_engine","2998493_The_Holy_Grail_of_Multimedia_Information_Retrieval_So_Close_or_Yet_So_Far_Away","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation"]}
