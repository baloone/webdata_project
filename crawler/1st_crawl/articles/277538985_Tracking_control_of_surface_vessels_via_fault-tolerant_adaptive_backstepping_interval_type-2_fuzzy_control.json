{"id":"277538985_Tracking_control_of_surface_vessels_via_fault-tolerant_adaptive_backstepping_interval_type-2_fuzzy_control","abstract":"This paper focuses on tracking control of fully actuated surface vessels along a desired trajectory in the presence of time-varying hydrodynamic disturbances. The combination of backstepping control and approximation-based adaptive technique allows the proposed controller to accommodate certain faults in the plant and the controller itself, and to handle time-varying hydrodynamic disturbances without explicit knowledge about the disturbance model. Through backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis, a state feedback fault-tolerant adaptive backstepping interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller is introduced, with the option of high-gain observer for output feedback control. The stability of the closed-loop systems is explored where sufficient condition for guaranteeing global asymptotic convergence of the tracking errors in state feedback control is proposed, whereas semiglobal uniform boundedness of the closed-loop signals in output feedback control is guaranteed. Simulation studies with a container ship are carried out. The proposed technique is found to be effective and robust.","authors":["Xuetao Chen","Woei Wan Tan"],"meta":["September 2013Ocean Engineering 70:97-109","DOI:10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.05.021"],"references":["224459783_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Congestion_Control_for_Video_Streaming_Across_IP_Networks","221929902_Output_Feedback_Tracking_of_Ships","41719906_Kinematic_Models_for_Manoeuvring_and_Seakeeping_of_Marine_Vessels","41719903_An_Overview_of_the_Marine_Systems_Simulator_MSS_A_Simulink_Toolbox_for_Marine_Control_Systems","41719872_Nonlinear_Time-Domain_Strip_Theory_Formulation_for_Low-Speed_Maneuvering_and_Station-Keeping","3912526_Concepts_and_methods_in_fault-tolerant_control","3455487_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_A_Historical_View","3336409_An_Incremental_Adaptive_Life_Long_Learning_Approach_for_Type-2_Fuzzy_Embedded_Agents_in_Ambient_Intelligent_Environments","3336186_Mendel_JM_Computing_derivatives_in_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems_IEEE_Trans_Fuzzy_Syst_12_84-98","3301634_Fuzzy_basis_functions_universal_approximation_and_orthogonal_least-squares_learning","284222283_E-navigation_a_glimpse_into_the_future","258161956_A_dynamic_model_and_a_robust_controller_for_a_fully-actuated_marine_surface_vessel","244971456_Non-linear_and_adaptive_backstepping_designs_for_tracking_control_of_ships","224439574_A_Recurrent_Self-Evolving_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Neural_Network_for_Dynamic_System_Processing","224256850_Tracking_control_of_surface_vessels_via_adaptive_type-2_fuzzy_logic_control","224160862_A_type-2_fuzzy_logic_controller_for_dynamic_positioning_systems","223277659_Industrial_applications_of_type-2_fuzzy_sets_and_systems_A_concise_review","222319337_Adaptive_maneuvering_with_experiments_for_a_model_ship_in_a_marine_control_laboratory","3335629_Approximation_accuracy_analysis_of_fuzzy_systems_as_function_approximators","2251016_Passive_Nonlinear_Observer_Design_for_Ships_Using_Lyapunov_Methods_Full-Scale_Experiments_with_a_Supply_Vessel"]}
