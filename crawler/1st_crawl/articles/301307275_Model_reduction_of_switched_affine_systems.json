{"id":"301307275_Model_reduction_of_switched_affine_systems","abstract":"This paper addresses model reduction and extends balanced truncation to the class of switched affine systems with endogenous switching. The switched affine system is rewritten as a switched linear one with state resets that account for the affine terms. Balanced truncation can then be applied to each mode dynamics, independently. As a result, different reduced state vectors are associated with the different modes, and reset maps are here appropriately redefined so as to account and compensate for this mismatch, possibly preserving the continuity of the output. The overall behavior of the reduced switched system is determined by both the selected reduction per mode and the adopted reset maps. In this paper, we consider a stochastic setting and propose a randomized method for the selection of the reduced order. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through a multi-room temperature control example.","authors":["Alessandro Vittorio Papadopoulos","Maria Prandini"],"meta":["August 2016Automatica 70(6):57-65","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2016.03.019"],"references":["289639043_A_simulation-based_approach_to_the_approximation_of_stochastic_hybrid_systems","262690075_Performance_assessment_and_design_of_abstracted_models_for_stochastic_hybrid_systems_through_a_randomized_approach","257388149_Approximate_Model_Checking_of_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems","257388147_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems_A_Powerful_Framework_for_Complex_Large_Scale_Applications","256495043_Model_Reduction_of_Switched_Systems_Based_on_Switching_Generalized_Gramians","227278272_PHAVer_Algorithmic_Verification_of_Hybrid_Systems_Past_HyTech","225671727_Benchmarks_for_Hybrid_Systems_Verification","225640937_Ellipsoidal_Techniques_for_Hybrid_Dynamics_the_Reachability_Problem","225494669_PHAVer_Algorithmic_verification_of_hybrid_systems_past_HyTech","224085255_Approximately_Bisimilar_Symbolic_Models_for_Incrementally_Stable_Switched_Systems","222665391_The_scenario_approach_for_systems_and_control_design","221422290_Computational_Approaches_to_Reachability_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems","221421755_Towars_a_Theory_of_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems","221044462_Hybrid_system_reduction","220652086_Approximate_Simulation_Relations_for_Hybrid_Systems","45599009_Approximations_of_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems","32206627_Approximation_Metrics_for_Discrete_and_Continuous_Systems","2986168_Computational_techniques_for_the_verification_of_hybrid_systems","313098249_Towards_a_theory_of_stochastic_hybrid_systems","282795008_Realization_Theory_of_Linear_Hybrid_Systems","261959572_Model_reduction_of_switched_affine_systems_a_method_based_on_balanced_truncation_and_randomized_optimization","254761078_Observability_reduction_of_piecewise-affine_hybrid_systems","254055028_Approximate_abstractions_of_stochastic_systems_A_randomized_method","235358281_Balanced_truncation_for_linear_switched_systems","225611863_A_Sampling-and-Discarding_Approach_to_Chance-Constrained_Optimization_Feasibility_and_Optimality","221422008_ZonotopeHyperplane_Intersection_for_Hybrid_Systems_Reachability_Analysis","220159484_Optimal_complexity_reduction_of_polyhedral_piecewise_affine_systems","4156067_Optimal_Control_of_Stochastic_Hybrid_Systems_Based_on_Locally_Consistent_Markov_Decision_Processes","3842252_Stability_of_Switched_Systems_with_Average_Dwell-Time","2985724_A_game_theoretic_approach_to_controller_design_for_hybrid_systems"]}
