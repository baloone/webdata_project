{"id":"340694096_The_Socio-Economic_Implications_of_the_Coronavirus_and_COVID-19_Pandemic_A_Review","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 1.4 million confirmed cases and over 83,000 deaths globally. It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions forced a decrease in the workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need of commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector has also seen a great demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.","authors":["Maria Nicola","Zaid Alsafi","Catrin Sohrabi","Ahmed Kerwan"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Surgery (London, England) 78","DOI:10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018"],"references":["340590634_Evidence_Based_Management_Guideline_for_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_-_Review_article","340010369_Covid-19_How_doctors_and_healthcare_systems_are_tackling_coronavirus_worldwide","339516973_World_Health_Organization_declares_Global_Emergency_A_review_of_the_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_COVID-19","49775487_Social_and_economic_impact_of_school_closure_resulting_from_pandemic_influenza_AH1N1","26882755_The_Possible_Macroeconomic_Impact_on_the_UK_of_an_Influenza_Pandemic"]}
