{"id":"222653096_Experimental_analysis_of_the_magnetoelastic_anisotropy_of_a_non-oriented_silicon_iron_alloy","abstract":"This paper deals with experimental measurements of the mechanical, magnetic and magnetostrictive behaviours of a non-oriented 3%SiFe alloy. The results show that the low crystallographic texture of the material brings important anisotropic effects and that the coupled magnetomechanical properties are much more sensitive than uncoupled ones.","authors":["Olivier Hubert","Laurent Daniel","Rene Billardon"],"meta":["January 2003Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 254:352-354","DOI:10.1016/S0304-8853(02)00850-8"],"references":["238928629_Magnetostriction_and_so-called_form_effect","224470917_Magnetostriction_measurements_with_a_recording_rotating_field_magnetostrictometer","3101977_Relevance_of_magnetostriction_and_forces_for_the_generation_of_audible_noise_of_transformer_cores"]}
