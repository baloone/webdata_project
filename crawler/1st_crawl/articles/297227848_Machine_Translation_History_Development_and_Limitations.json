{"id":"297227848_Machine_Translation_History_Development_and_Limitations","abstract":"Machine translation (MT) is a term used to describe a range of computer-based activities involving translation. This article reviews sixty years of history of MT research and development, concentrating on the essential difficulties and limitations of the task, and how the various approaches have attempted to solve, or more usually work round, these. History of MT is said to date from a period just after the Second World War during which the earliest computers had been used for code-breaking. In the late 1980s the field underwent a major change in direction with the emergence of a radically new way of doing MT. Two main approaches to MT have emerged and these are rulebased and statistics-based. These approaches owe little to conventional linguistic methods and ideas, but it must be recognized that the much faster development cycle has made functional versions of MT systems covering new language pairs become available. © Editorial matter and organization 2011 Kirsten Malmkjær and Kevin Windle.
