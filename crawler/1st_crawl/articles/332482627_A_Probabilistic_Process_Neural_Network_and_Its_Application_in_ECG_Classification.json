{"id":"332482627_A_Probabilistic_Process_Neural_Network_and_Its_Application_in_ECG_Classification","abstract":"A novel probabilistic process neural network (PPNN) model is proposed for the multi-channel time-varying signal classification problems with ambiguity and randomness distribution characteristics. This model was constructed from an input time-varying signal layer, a probabilistic process neuron (PPN) hidden layer, a pattern layer, and a Softmax classifier. The number of nodes in the input layer is the same as the number of time-varying signal input channels, which can realize the overall input of the time-varying signal. The PPN hidden layer performs the spatio-temporal aggregation operations for time-varying input signals and probabilistic outputs. The connection weight functions from the input layer to the hidden layer are represented by the typical samples or cluster center functions in different pattern subsets of the sample set, which the prior knowledge of signal categories is implicitly expressed by the morphological distribution features and combinational relations. A pattern layer selectively summed to the output of the PPN hidden layer using the categorical attributes of the connection weight function vector. And the Softmax classifier implements the probabilistic classification of time-varying signals. PPNN has the advantages of less model parameters, suitable for modeling small samples, and integrating prior knowledge of signal categories, etc. This study develops the specific learning algorithms which synthesize dynamic time warping, C-means clustering and BP algorithm. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for heart disease diagnosis were used for classification testing. Experimental results from 12-lead ECG signal across ten types of disease classification verify the effectiveness of the model and the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Naidan Feng","Shaohua Xu","Yongquan Liang","Kun Liu"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2910880"],"references":["330245781_A_radial_basis_probabilistic_process_neural_network_model_and_corresponding_classification_algorithm","324053864_ENCASE_an_ENsemble_ClASsifiEr_for_ECG_Classification_Using_Expert_Features_and_Deep_Neural_Networks","323276511_A_Generative_Modeling_Approach_to_Limited_Channel_ECG_Classification","320464868_Beat_by_Beat_Classifying_Cardiac_Arrhythmias_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","318474046_Inferior_myocardial_infarction_detection_using_stationary_wavelet_transform_and_machine_learning_approach","315044664_T-wave_loop_area_from_a_pre-implant_12-lead_ECG_is_associated_with_appropriate_ICD_shocks","314269574_Dynamic_time_warping_assessment_of_high-resolution_melt_curves_provides_a_robust_metric_for_fungal_identification","281613804_Photoplethysmography-Based_Heart_Rate_Monitoring_Using_Asymmetric_Least_Squares_Spectrum_Subtraction_and_Bayesian_Decision_Theory","272514836_Interacting_Agricultural_Pests_and_Their_Effect_on_Crop_Yield_Application_of_a_Bayesian_Decision_Theory_Approach_to_the_Joint_Management_of_Bromus_tectorum_and_Cephus_cinctus","272158669_Image_segmentation_by_generalized_hierarchical_fuzzy_C-means_algorithm","265466085_Ambiguity-Driven_Fuzzy_C-Means_Clustering_How_to_Detect_Uncertain_Clustered_Records","262353983_Enhanced_probabilistic_neural_network_with_local_decision_circles_A_robust_classifier","256426451_A_Neuro_Fuzzy_Computing_Technique_for_Modeling_Hydrological_Time_Series","256102831_DTW4Omics_Comparing_Patterns_in_Biological_Time_Series","241770605_Searching_and_Mining_Trillions_of_Time_Series_Subsequences_under_Dynamic_Time_Warping","228785661_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Algorithm_Review","222868331_FCM-the_Fuzzy_C-Means_clustering-algorithm","38105301_Computing_and_Visualizing_Dynamic_Time_Warping_Alignments_in_R_The_dtw_Package","5576434_Learning_vector_quantization_for_the_probabilistic_neural_network","4210245_Dynamic_time_warping_as_a_novel_tool_in_pattern_recognition_of_ECG_changes_in_heart_rhythm_disturbances","4202702_Bayesian_ANN_classifier_for_ECG_arrhythmia_diagnostic_system_A_comparison_study","4194066_A_new_approach_to_signal_classification_using_spectral_correlation_and_neural_networks","3302805_Probabilistic_neural-network_structure_determination_for_pattern_classification","330643042_A_Fuzzy_Process_Neural_Network_Model_and_Its_Application_In_Process_Signal_Classification","328990475_A_Generative_Modeling_Approach_to_Limited_Channel_ECG_Classification","324920354_Research_on_Clinical_Electrocardiogram_Classification_Algorithm_Based_on_Ensemble_Learning","318259423_Cardiologist-Level_Arrhythmia_Detection_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","316753002_A_Scaled_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Fast_Supervised_Learning","297810721_Some_theoretical_issues_on_continuous_process_neural_networks","291555572_Real-Time_Fault_Detection_Approach_for_Nonlinear_Systems_and_its_Asynchronous_T-S_Fuzzy_Observer-Based_Implementation","280940018_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning","240427893_Apparatus_and_method_for_motion_detection_and_tracking_of_objects_in_a_region_for_col_-_lision_avoidance_utilizing_a_real_-_time_adaptive_probabilistic_neural_network","224159765_Chinese_Cardiovascular_Disease_Database_CCDD_and_Its_Management_Tool","222813940_Bifurcation_Structure_of_Equilibria_of_Iterated_Softmax","222413467_Electrocardiogram_beat_classification_based_wavelet_and_probabilistic_neural_network","6977770_Bayesian_decision_theory_in_sensorimotor_control","3545260_Probabilistic_Neural_Networks_for_Classification_Mapping_or_Associative_Memory"]}
