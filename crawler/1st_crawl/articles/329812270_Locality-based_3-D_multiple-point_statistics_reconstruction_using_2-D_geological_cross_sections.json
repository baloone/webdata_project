{"id":"329812270_Locality-based_3-D_multiple-point_statistics_reconstruction_using_2-D_geological_cross_sections","abstract":"Multiple-point statistics (MPS) has shown promise in\nrepresenting complicated subsurface structures. For a practical\nthree-dimensional (3-D) application, however, one of the critical issues is\nthe difficulty in obtaining a credible 3-D training image. However,\nbidimensional (2-D) training images are often available because established\nworkflows exist to derive 2-D sections from scattered boreholes and/or other\nsamples. In this work, we propose a locality-based MPS approach to\nreconstruct 3-D geological models on the basis of such 2-D cross sections (3DRCS),\nmaking 3-D training images unnecessary. Only several local\ntraining subsections closer to the central uninformed node are used in the\nMPS simulation. The main advantages of this partitioned search strategy are\nthe high computational efficiency and a relaxation of the stationarity\nassumption. We embed this strategy into a standard MPS framework. Two\nprobability aggregation formulas and their combinations are used to assemble\nthe probability density functions (PDFs) from different subsections.\nMoreover, a novel strategy is adopted to capture more stable PDFs, where the\ndistances between patterns and flexible neighborhoods are integrated on\nmultiple grids. A series of sensitivity analyses demonstrate the\nstability of the proposed approach. Several hydrogeological 3-D application\nexamples illustrate the applicability of the 3DRCS approach in reproducing\ncomplex geological features. The results, in comparison with previous MPS\nmethods, show better performance in portraying anisotropy characteristics\nand in CPU cost.","authors":["Qiyu Chen","Gregoire Mariethoz","Gang Liu","Alessandro Comunian"],"meta":["December 2018Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 22(12):6547-6566","DOI:10.5194/hess-22-6547-2018","Project: 3D reconstruction using 2D geological cross-sections"],"references":["325765495_Locality-based_3-D_multiple-point_statistics_reconstruction_using_2-D_geological_cross_sections","323535329_Local_curvature_entropy-based_3D_terrain_representation_using_a_comprehensive_Quadtree","316740430_A_corner-point-grid-based_voxelization_method_for_the_complex_geological_structure_model_with_folds","310839373_Multiple-point_statistical_simulation_for_hydrogeological_models_3D_training_image_development_and_conditioning_strategies","307846299_The_effect_of_training_image_and_secondary_data_integration_with_multiple-point_geostatistics_in_groundwater_modelling","307835069_Large-scale_3-D_modeling_by_integration_of_resistivity_models_and_borehole_data_through_inversion","307832645_Simulation_of_rainfall_time_series_from_different_climatic_regions_using_the_direct_sampling_technique","304028680_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Simulate_and_Validate_Orebody_Realizations_with_Complex_Trends_A_Case_Study_in_Heavy_Mineral_Sands","318237557_Reconstruction_of_Three-Dimensional_Aquifer_Heterogeneity_from_Two-Dimensional_Geophysical_Data","307589519_Modeling_Uncertainty_in_the_Earth_Sciences"]}
