{"id":"293127438_Displacement_approach_for_generalized_Rayleigh_waves_in_layered_solid-fluid_media","abstract":"A finite-element method for the propagation of Rayleigh-type waves in layered solid-fluid media is presented. The method uses displacement as the only parameter to describe the solid and the fluid motions. A penalty function method and a selective integration technique are employed to change the elastic coefficient matrix of fluid from singular to nonsingular. Results obtained from the proposed method agree well with those obtained from available analytical solutions. The method can be used to study the propagation of Rayleigh-type waves in a two-dimensional, irregular solid-fluid system. -Author","authors":["H.H.
