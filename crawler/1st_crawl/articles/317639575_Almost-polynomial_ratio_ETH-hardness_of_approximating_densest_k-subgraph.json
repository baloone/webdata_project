{"id":"317639575_Almost-polynomial_ratio_ETH-hardness_of_approximating_densest_k-subgraph","abstract":"In the Densest k-Subgraph (DkS) problem, given an undirected graph G and an integer k, the goal is to find a subgraph of G on k vertices that contains maximum number of edges. Even though Bhaskara et al.âs state-of-the-art algorithm for the problem achieves only O(n1/4 + Îµ) approximation ratio, previous attempts at proving hardness of approximation, including those under average case assumptions, fail to achieve a polynomial ratio; the best ratios ruled out under any worst case assumption and any average case assumption are only any constant (Raghavendra and Steurer) and 2Î©(log2/3n) (Alon et al.) respectively.\nIn this work, we show, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that approximates Densest k-Subgraph to within n1/(loglogn)c factor of the optimum, where c > 0 is a universal constant independent of n. In addition, our result has perfect completeness, meaning that we prove that it is ETH-hard to even distinguish between the case in which G contains a k-clique and the case in which every induced k-subgraph of G has density at most 1/nâ1/(loglogn)c in polynomial time.\nMoreover, if we make a stronger assumption that there is some constant Îµ > 0 such that no subexponential-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is only (1 â Îµ)-satisfiable (also known as Gap-ETH), then the ratio above can be improved to nf(n) for any function f whose limit is zero as n goes to infinity (i.e. f â o(1)).","authors":["Pasin Manurangsi"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055399.3055412","Conference: the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["305186425_A_Birthday_Repetition_Theorem_and_Complexity_of_Approximating_Dense_CSPs","290182184_On_approximating_projection_games","280589974_Approximating_Dense_Max_2-CSPs","259915238_AM_with_Multiple_Merlins","234794393_Proof_Verification_and_the_Hardness_of_Approximation_Problems","234783217_Interactive_proofs_and_the_hardness_of_approximating_cliques","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220780416_The_Prize-Collecting_Generalized_Steiner_Tree_Problem_Via_A_New_Approach_Of_Primal-Dual_Schema","220617052_Short_PCPs_with_Polylog_Query_Complexity","345772508_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Approximate_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria","312444359_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Label_Cover_and_The_Log-Density_Threshold","312079573_ETH_Hardness_for_Densest-_k_-Subgraph_with_Perfect_Completeness","311569113_Inapproximability_Results_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","311490964_Can_Almost_Everybody_be_Almost_Happy","306186942_Inapproximability_Results_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","292215841_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_and_Dense_Bipartite_Subgraphs_via_an_Approximate_Version_of_Caratheodory's_Theorem","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","282997327_ETH-Hardness_for_Signaling_in_Symmetric_Zero-Sum_Games","282719809_Approximating_the_best_Nash_Equilibrium_in_no_1ogn-time_breaks_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","275669212_ETH_Hardness_for_Densest-k-Subgraph_with_Perfect_Completeness","262160786_Detecting_high_log-densities_-_An_On14_approximation_for_densest_k-subgraph","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","232346494_Expected_complexity_of_graph_partitioning_problems","228057642_Probabilistic_checking_of_proofs_A_new_characterization_of_NP","225438318_The_Dense_k_-Subgraph_Problem","225226038_Finding_dense_subgraphs_with_semidefinite_programming","224872384_Everywhere-Sparse_Spanners_via_Dense_Subgraphs","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222551950_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximization_Problems_Arising_in_Graph_Partitioning","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","222518136_Complexity_of_finding_dense_subgraphs","222225401_The_Quadratic_Knapsack_Problem-A_Survey","221591006_The_PCP_theorem_by_gap_amplification","221590314_Graph_expansion_and_the_unique_games_conjecture","221580635_Relations_between_Average_Case_Complexity_and_Approximation_Complexity","221498397_On_Choosing_a_Dense_Subgraph_Extended_Abstract","221296882_Finding_Dense_Subgraphs_with_Size_Bounds","220617401_Ruling_Out_PTAS_for_Graph_Min-Bisection_Dense_k-Subgraph_and_Bipartite_Clique","220432000_Two-Query_PCP_with_Subconstant_Error","220345442_Large_Cliques_Elude_the_Metropolis_Process","220345261_Testing_subgraphs_in_large_graphs","220138232_The_PCP_theorem_by_gap_amplification","51943423_Polynomial_integrality_gaps_for_strong_SDP_relaxations_of_Densestk-subgraph","47744343_Reductions_Between_Expansion_Problems","45895759_Detecting_High_Log-Densities_--_an_On14_Approximation_for_Densest_k-Subgraph","45892658_The_Dense_k_Subgraph_problem","4294358_Inapproximability_Results_for_Sparsest_Cut_Optimal_Linear_Arrangement_and_Precedence_Constrained_Scheduling","3593537_On_Choosing_a_Dense_Subgraph","2810833_On_the_Densest_K-Subgraph_Problem","2321784_The_Dense_k-Subgraph_Problem","2264279_Efficient_Probabilistically_Checkable_Proofs_and_Applications_to_Approximation"]}
