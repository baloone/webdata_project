{"id":"223001705_Gender-Based_Differences_in_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","abstract":"The present study was designed to investigate the attitudes of secondary school students towards computers. Approximately 1750 ninth and twelfth grade students from five different school districts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, participated in the survey. A significant sex difference in attitudes towards computers was observed. Although both males and females alike were aware of the value and benefits of computers in daily life, girls showed less interest in learning about and using computers. Male and female differences were mostly realized with respect to self-confidence in using computers. Girls reported fear of using computers and feeling helpless around computers. Nevertheless females strongly showed that women have equal competencies in computer use. The results also revealed a strong relationship between students' computer attitudes and their perception of their parents' attitude toward computers. The statistical analysis supported the hypothesis that the differences in attitude (interest, confidence and stereotyping) about computers among girls and boys are significant and reflect gender-role socialization.","authors":["Lily Shashaani"],"meta":["March 1993Computers & Education 20(2):169-181","DOI:10.1016/0360-1315(93)90085-W"],"references":["270328081_The_Emergence_of_Sociological_Theory","232527415_Sex_Differences_in_Achievement_A_Test_of_Alternate_Theories","226819080_The_socialization_of_sex-differentiated_skills_and_academic_performance_A_mediational_model","289963678_Expectations_values_and_academic_behaviors","286101457_Second_class_citizens","284520107_Sociology","276238494_Cross-Cultural_Comparison_of_Gender_Differences_in_Adolescents'_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_and_Selected_School_Subjects","264750272_Self-Concepts_and_Stereotypes_of_Vocational_Preferences","249107717_Mismeasuring_Women_A_Critique_of_Research_on_Computer_Ability_and_Avoidance","249107652_Women_and_Computers_An_Introduction","242417043_Gender_and_Computers_The_Beneficial_Effects_of_Experience_on_Attitudes","242377815_Educational_pipeline_issues_for_women","241050895_A_Cognitive-Process_Taxonomy_for_Sex_Differences_in_Cognitive_Abilities","238691245_American_and_Soviet_Children's_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","238293185_Parental_and_Peer_Influences_on_Adolescents'_Educational_Plans_Some_Further_Evidence","234795391_Bits_'n_Bytes_about_Computing_A_Computer_Literacy_Primer","234632886_The_Computer_Male_Female_or_Androgynous","234579106_Sex_Equity_Increasing_Girls'_Use_of_Computers","233896950_Socialization_of_Achievement_Attitudes_and_Beliefs_Parental_Influences","233896767_Gender_Roles_and_Women's_Achievement-Related_Decisions","232587706_A_Comparison_of_Nontraditional_and_Traditional_Career_Women","232484879_Psychosocial_implications_of_sex_differences_in_attitudes_toward_computers_Results_of_a_survey","232419372_Sex-Related_Differences_in_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_Implications_for_Counselors","229746909_Factors_that_Affect_Nontraditional_Vocational_Enrollment_Among_Women","227291885_Cognitive_support_for_the_career_choices_of_college_women","226935704_Sex_differences_on_the_California_statewide_assessment_of_computer_literacy","226905262_Aspiring_parents'_and_teachers'_academic_beliefs_about_young_children","226875983_Gender_and_computers_Two_surveys_of_computer-related_attitudes","226044116_Achievement-related_expectations_and_aspirations_in_college_women","225931212_Sex_role_attitudes_of_self_and_those_inferred_of_peers_performance_and_career_opportunities_as_reported_by_women_in_nontraditional_vs_traditional_training_programs","225897847_Gender_Differences_in_Enrollment_in_Computer_Camps","223622471_Correlates_of_Sex_Differences_in_Attitudes_Toward_and_Involvement_with_Computers","223443535_The_effect_of_computer_use_on_gender_differences_in_attitudes_to_computers","220422861_Women_and_Computing","215466715_Relationships_of_Computer_Attitudes_to_Sex_Grade-Level_and_Teacher_Influence","21700341_Second-class_citizens","16065408_Prenatal_Gonadal_Hormones_and_Sex_Differences_in_Human_Behavior","15765129_Sex_Differences_in_Mathematical_Ability_Fact_or_Artifact"]}
