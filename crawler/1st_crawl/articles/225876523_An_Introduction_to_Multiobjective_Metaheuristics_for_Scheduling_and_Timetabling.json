{"id":"225876523_An_Introduction_to_Multiobjective_Metaheuristics_for_Scheduling_and_Timetabling","abstract":"In many real-world scheduling problems (eg. machine scheduling, educational timetabling, personnel scheduling, etc.) several\ncriteria must be considered simultaneously when evaluating the quality of the solution or schedule. Among these criteria there\nare: length of the schedule, utilisation of resources, satisfaction of peopleâ€™s preferences and compliance with regulations.\nTraditionally, these problems have been tackled as single-objective optimization problems after combining the multiple criteria\ninto a single scalar value. A number of multiobjective metaheuristics have been proposed in recent years to obtain sets of\ncompromise solutions for multiobjective optimization problems in a single run and without the need to convert the problem\nto a single-objective one. Most of these techniques have been successfully tested in both benchmark and real-world multiobjective\nproblems. However, the number of reported applications of these techniques to scheduling problems is still relatively scarce.\nThis paper presents an introduction to the application of multiobjective metaheuristics to some multicriteria scheduling problems.","authors":["J.
