{"id":"284158538_Identifying_21st_Century_STEM_Competencies_Using_Workplace_Data","abstract":"Gaps between Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)\neducation and required workplace skills have been identified in industry,\nacademia, and government. Educators acknowledge the need to reform STEM\neducation to better prepare students for their future careers. We pursue this\ngrowing interest in the skills needed for STEM disciplines and ask whether\nframeworks for 21st century skills and engineering education cover all of\nimportant STEM competencies. In this study, we identify important STEM\ncompetencies and evaluate the relevance of current frameworks applied in\neducation using the standardized job-specific database operated and maintained\nby the United States Department of Labor. Our analysis of the importance of 109\nskills, types of knowledge and work activities, revealed 18 skills, seven\ncategories of knowledge, and 27 work activities important for STEM workers. We\ninvestigate the perspectives of STEM and non-STEM job incumbents, comparing the\nimportance of each skill, knowledge, and work activity for the two groups. We\naimed to condense dimensions of the 52 key areas by categorizing them according\nto the Katz and Kahn (1978) framework and testing for inter-rater reliability.\nOur findings show frameworks for 21st century skills and engineering education\ndo not encompass all important STEM competencies. Implications for STEM\neducation programs are discussed, including how they can bridge gaps between\neducation and important workplace competencies.","authors":["Hyewon Jang"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Science Education and Technology 25(2):284-301","DOI:10.1007/s10956-015-9593-1"],"references":["293074894_OECD_Skills_Outlook_First_Results_of_the_Survey_of_Adult_Skills","289747300_Team-Based_Learning_in_a_Statistical_Literacy_Class","281144469_Teaching_Critical_Thinking","313430456_Assessment_and_classroom_learning","290230097_Transition_of_knowledgeskills_requirement_for_entry-level_is_professionals_An_exploratory_study_based_on_recruiters'_perception","288701923_Educational_gaps_as_perceived_by_is_educators_A_survey_of_knowledge_and_skill_requirements","288440376_Problem-Solving_Ability","286012439_The_Social_Psychology_of_Organizations","285196562_Opportunities","284351918_Research_and_Teaching_Collaborative_Testing_Evidence_of_Learning_in_a_Controlled_In-Class_Study_of_Undergraduate_Students","278307198_Disentangling_the_role_of_high_school_grades_SAT_R_scores_and_SES_in_predicting_college_achievement","271699000_Identifying_the_most_important_21st_century_workforce_competencies_An_analysis_of_the_Occupational_Information_Network_ONET","271424016_SYNTHESIZING_FRAMEWORKS_OF_HIGHER_EDUCATION_STUDENT_LEARNING_OUTCOMES","266653558_Gaps_between_industry_expectations_and_the_abilities_of_graduates","265435171_Everyday_Problem_Solving_in_Engineering_Lessons_for_Engineering_Educators"]}
