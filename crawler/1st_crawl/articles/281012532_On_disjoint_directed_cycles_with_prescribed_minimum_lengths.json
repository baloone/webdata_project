{"id":"281012532_On_disjoint_directed_cycles_with_prescribed_minimum_lengths","abstract":"In this paper, we show that the k-Linkage problem is polynomial-time solvable for digraphs with circumference at most 2. We also show that the directed cycles of length at least 3 have the Erdős-Pósa Property : for every n, there exists an integer t_n such that for every digraph D, either D contains n disjoint directed cycles of length at least 3, or there is a set T of t_n vertices that meets every directed cycle of length at least 3. From these two results, we deduce that if F is the disjoint union of directed cycles of length at most 3, then one can decide in polynomial time if a digraph contains a subdivision of F.","authors":["Frédéric Havet","Ana Karolinna Maia"],"meta":["April 2013"],"references":["220441990_Packing_Directed_Circuits","282673951_On_a_problem_of_Turan_in_the_theory_of_graphs","265461094_On_independent_circuits_in_a_graph","265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic","220151180_The_Directed_Subgraph_Homeomorphism_Problem"]}
