{"id":"335603616_Planetary_Impact_Processes_in_Porous_Materials","abstract":"Porous materials abound in the Solar System. Primordial solids accreted gently from dust into fragile, high-porosity aggregates; many asteroids have been disrupted and reaccreted as loosely bound porous rubble piles; and the crusts of airless, unprotected planetary surfaces are heavily fractured from prolonged bombardment of asteroids and comets. High porosity attenuates shock propagation and localizes shock heating, which has several important implications for the evolution of planetary surfaces. The high porosity of early solids implies that shock heating from collisions may have been sufficient to lithify the compacted material, mobilize fluids, cause crystallographic transformation and even generate significant volumes of melt. Internal porosity in asteroids increases their resistance to collisional disruption and reduces momentum transfer efficiency by virtue of enhanced shock attenuation and reduced particle velocity. This enhances accretional efficiency and lengthens the collisional lifespan of asteroids, but at the same time makes them harder to deflect by kinetic impact. Porosity in the crusts and soils of planetary surfaces has a similar effect on the impact process, reducing the speed and mass of ejecta as well as the ultimate size of the crater. Constraining the influence of subsurface porosity variations on impact crater size is a crucial step in using crater populations to estimate impactor flux, date planetary surfaces and infer subsurface properties.","authors":["Gareth S.
