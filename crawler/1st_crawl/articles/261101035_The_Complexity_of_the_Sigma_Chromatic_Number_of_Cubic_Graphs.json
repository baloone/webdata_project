{"id":"261101035_The_Complexity_of_the_Sigma_Chromatic_Number_of_Cubic_Graphs","abstract":"The {\\it sigma chromatic number} of a graph $G$, denoted by $\\sigma(G)$, is\nthe minimum number $k$ that the vertices can be partitioned into $k$ disjoint\nsets $V_1, \\ldots, V_k$ such that for every two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$\nthere is an index $i$ that $u$ and $v$ have different numbers of neighbors in\n$V_i$.\nWe show that, it is $ \\mathbf{NP} $-complete to decide for a given 3-regular\ngraph $G$, whether $ \\sigma(G)=2$. Also, we prove that for every $k\\geq 3$, it\nis {\\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $\\sigma(G)= k$ for a given graph $G$.\nFurthermore, for planar $3$-regular graphs with $\\sigma=2$, we show that the\nproblem of minimizing the size of a set is $ \\mathbf{NP} $-hard.","authors":["Ali Dehghan","Mohammad-Reza Sadeghi","Arash Ahadi"],"meta":["March 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221661710_Additive_Coloring_of_Planar_Graphs","262321605_Algorithmic_complexity_of_proper_labeling_problems","257428713_Hard_Tiling_Problems_with_Simple_Tiles","257406767_On_the_Lucky_Choice_Number_of_Graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","242789994_Uniqueness_of_colorability_and_colorability_of_planar_4-regular_graphs_are_NP-complete","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","222153315_Lucky_labelings_of_graphs","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
