{"id":"267436576_Homomorphisms_of_planar_signed_graphs_to_signed_projective_cubes","abstract":"We conjecture that every signed graph of unbalanced girth 2g, whose underlying graph is bipartite and planar, admits a homomorphism to the signed projective cube of dimension 2g-1. Our main result is to show that for a given g, this conjecture is equivalent to the corresponding case (k=2g) of a conjecture of Seymour claiming that every planar k-regular multigraph with no odd edge-cut of less than k edges is k-edge-colorable. To this end, we exhibit several properties of signed projective cubes and establish a folding lemma for planar even signed graphs.","authors":["Reza Naserasr","Edita Rollov√°","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["October 2013Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 15(3)","DOI:10.1007/978-88-7642-475-5_44"],"references":["264625947_Homomorphisms_of_Signed_Graphs","264470280_2_-Coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_large_odd-girth","263479544_Mapping_Planar_Graphs_into_Projective_Cubes","232346487_Signed_graphs","230802761_Edge-colouring_eight-regular_planar_graphs","229675598_Graphs_and_Homomorphisms","222576294_Homomorphisms_and_edge-colorings_of_planar_graphs","216877583_Graph_Coloring_Problems","46588221_Packing_six_T-joins_in_plane_graphs"]}
