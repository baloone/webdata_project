{"id":"292338298_Adaptive_second-order_sliding_mode_control_with_uncertainty_compensation","abstract":"This paper endows the second-order sliding mode control (2-SMC) approach with additional capabilities of learning and control adaptation. We present a 2-SMC scheme that estimates and compensates for the uncertainties affecting the system dynamics. It also adjusts the discontinuous control effort on-line, so that it can be reduced to arbitrarily small values. The proposed scheme is particularly useful when the available information regarding the uncertainties is conservative, and the classical “fixed-gain” SMC would inevitably lead to largely oversized discontinuous control effort. Benefits from the viewpoint of chattering reduction are obtained, as confirmed by computer simulations.","authors":["Giorgio Bartolini","Arie Levant","Alessandro Pisano","Elio Usai"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Control","DOI:10.1080/00207179.2016.1142616","Project: multiinput non linear systems with uncertain;time and state dependent, control direction "],"references":["316937179_Modern_Sliding_Mode_Control_Theory_New_Perspectives_and_Applications","308598751_An_asymptotic_second-order_smooth_sliding_mode_control","285329104_High-order_sliding_modes_Differentiation_and_output_feedback_control","266174752_Second-order_Sliding_Mode_Control_with_Adaptive_Control_Authority_for_the_Tracking_Control_of_Robotic_Manipulators","264909099_Adaptation_of_Sliding_Modes","281951707_Time-based_adaptive_second_order_sliding_mode_controller_for_wind_energy_conversion_optimization","279363950_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Observation","279350161_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Observation","271549938_Combined_switchedtime-based_adaptation_in_second_order_sliding_mode_control","261525394_High_order_integral_sliding_mode_control_with_gain_adaptation"]}
