{"id":"305997219_The_Face-Tracking_of_Sichuan_Golden_Monkeys_via_S-TLD","abstract":"Digital image technology has been widely used in wildlife monitoring, due to its advantages of non-obligatory, non-contact and non-invasive. However, the primary problem needing to be solved is how to detect and track the wild animals in these images and videos. This paper proposes a face-tracking algorithm for Sichuan golden monkeys by combing SVM and TLD, named as S-TLD. This algorithm is proposed based on the basic framework of TLD, and SVM is used as an alternate classifier to detect the face again, when the object appears in the video for the first time or TLD fails to tracking. Once SVM accomplishes the face detection, TLD completes the following tracking task. Experimental results demonstrate that S-TLD can be applied to the face detection and tracking of Sichuan golden monkeys in the videos, the location and facial information of the monkeys are very helpful for the study of their behavior habits.","authors":["Pengfei xu","Yu Long","Dongmei Zheng","Ruyi Liu"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-2260-9_11","Conference: Chinese Conference on Image and Graphics Technologies"],"references":["257291513_A_Brief_Overview_on_Different_Animal_Detection_Methods","221411566_Hidden_Markov_Models_Applied_to_Snakes_Behavior_Identification","221318569_Biometric_animal_databases_from_field_photographs_Identification_of_individual_zebra_in_the_wild","51866277_Tracking-Learning-Detection","23627268_An_emerging_movement_ecology_paradigm","3359552_Analysing_animal_behaviour_in_wildlife_videos_using_face_detection_and_tracking","285985232_Facial_similarity_in_Taihangshan_macaques_Macaca_mulatta_tcheliensis_based_on_modular_principal_components_analysis","275156849_A_Survey_on_Face_Detection_in_the_wild_past_present_and_future","252016173_Monitoring_Animal_Behavior_in_the_Smart_Vivarium","224201286_Face-TLD_Tracking-Learning-Detection_applied_to_faces","49681793_From_Tiger_to_Panda_Animal_Head_Detection","3974343_Tracking_multiple_animals_in_wildlife_footage"]}
