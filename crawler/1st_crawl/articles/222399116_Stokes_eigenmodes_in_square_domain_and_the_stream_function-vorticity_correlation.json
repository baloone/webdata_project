{"id":"222399116_Stokes_eigenmodes_in_square_domain_and_the_stream_function-vorticity_correlation","abstract":"The Stokes eigenmodes in the square are numerically determined and their symmetry properties are identified. The spectra evolution laws are in excellent qualitative agreement with the theoretical asymptotic predictions proposed by Constantin and Foias (in “Navier–Stokes equations”, University of Chicago Press, 1988), . The slopes are reported here and are found to be specific to the eigenmodes symmetry family. The dynamic equilibria are analyzed and show a linear relationship between the vorticity and the stream function in the core of the eigenmodes. These features of the Stokes eigenmodes confined in the square are shared by the fully periodic Stokes eigenmodes.","authors":["Emmanuel Leriche","Gérard Labrosse"],"meta":["November 2004Journal of Computational Physics 200(2):489-511","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2004.03.017","SourceOAI"],"references":["242913670_A_Legendre_Spectral_Galerkin_Method_for_the_Biharmonic_Dirichlet_Problem","242913440_Efficient_Spectral-Galerkin_Method_I_Direct_Solvers_of_Second_and_Fourth-Order_Equations_Using_Legendre_Polynomials","238547220_Decaying_two-dimensional_turbulence_in_square_containers_with_no-slip_or_stress-free_boundaries","225866050_Boundary_condition_for_incompressible_flows","225774127_Fundamental_Stokes_Eigenmodes_in_the_Square_Which_Expansion_Is_More_Accurate_Chebyshev_or_ReidHarris","51992021_Viscous_and_Resistive_Eddies_Near_a_Sharp_Corner","37446770_High-Order_Direct_Stokes_Solvers_with_or_Without_Temporal_Splitting_Numerical_Investigations_of_Their_Comparative_Properties","33038558_A_numerical_investigation_of_the_solution_of_a_class_of_fourth_order_eigenvalue_problem","2382955_Efficient_Spectral-Galerkin_Method_II_Direct_Solvers_of_Second-_and_Fourth-Order_Equations_Using_Chebyshev_Polynomials","313062853_On_steady_laminar_flow_with_closed_streamlines_at_large_Reynolds_number","265449023_Numerical_analysis_of_spectral_methods_Theory_and_applications","262409914_Timely_Communication_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Solving_a_Fourth-Order_Equation_with_the_Spectral-Galerkin_Method","256197412_An_Introduction_to_Fluid_Dynamic","254762813_Spin-Up_in_Non-Axisymmetric_Containers","250692456_On_the_eigenvalues_of_second-order_spectral_differentiation_operators","244945756_An_Introduction_To_Fluid_Dynamics","244571398_The_Bending_of_a_Semi-Infinite_Strip","243360432_Generalized_Stokes_Eigenfunctions_A_New_Trial_Basis_for_the_Solution_of_Incompressible_Navier-Stokes_Equations","241953202_Energy_and_Finite_Element_Methods_in_Structure_Mechanics","241614666_Decaying_quasi-two-dimensional_viscous_flow_on_a_square_domain","239394788_a_Direct_Pseudo-Spectral_Solver_of_the_2D3D_Stokes_Problem_Transition_to_Unsteadiness_of_Natural-Convection_Flow_in_a_Differentially_Heated_Cubical_Cavity","234437044_On_Orthogonal_Functions_which_Satisfy_Four_Boundary_CONDITIONSITABLES_for_Use_in_Fourier-Type_Expansions","234284262_Treatment_of_Incompressibility_and_Boundary_Conditions_in_3-D_Numerical_Spectral_Simulations_of_Plane_Channel_Flows","234262497_On_Orthogonal_Functions_which_Satisfy_Four_Boundary_CONDITIONSIIINTEGRALS_for_Use_with_Fourier-Type_Expansions","232015404_On_Steady_Laminar_Flow_with_Closed_Stream_Lines_at_Large_Reynolds_Number","231866599_Spin-up_phenomena_in_non-axisymmetric_containers","230236026_The_Buckling_Load_for_a_rectangular_Plate_with_four_Clamped_Edges","226611426_The_free_surface_on_a_simple_fluid_between_cylinders_undergoing_torsional_oscillations_Part_III_Oscillating_planes","226445117_High_Precision_Solutions_of_Two_Fourth_Order_Eigenvalue_Problems","226321791_Eigenvalues_and_eigenfunctions_of_a_clover_plate","225250788_Creeping_flow_analyses_of_free_surface_cavity_flows","222487527_Spectral_method_solution_of_the_Stokes_equations_on_nonstaggered_grids","216756208_Spectral_Methods_in_Fluid_Dynamic","41700527_A_Legendre_Spectral_Collocation_Method_for_the_Biharmonic_Dirichlet_Problem","37179563_The_eddy_structure_in_Stokes_flow_in_a_cavity"]}
