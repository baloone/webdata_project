{"id":"225771651_Implementing_the_Arithmetic_of_C34_Curves","abstract":"We provide explicit formulae for realising the group law in Jacobians of superelliptic curves of genus3 and C\n3,4 curves. It is shown that two distinct elements in the Jacobian of a C\n3,4 curve can be added with 150multiplications and 2inversions in the field of definition of the curve, while an element can\nbe doubled with 174multiplications and 2inversions. In superelliptic curves, 10multiplications are saved.","authors":["Abdolali Basiri","Andreas Enge","Jean-Charles Faugère","Nicolas Gürel"],"meta":["April 2004Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3076:87-101","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-24847-7_6","Conference: 6th International Symposium on Algorithmic Number TheoryVolume: 3076"],"references":["225696112_Fast_Jacobian_Group_Arithmetic_on_Cab_Curves","221326775_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220576551_Arithmetic_on_superelliptic_curves","297316323_Index_calculus_attack_for_hyperelliptic_curves_of_small_genus","281567412_An_algorithm_for_solving_the_discrete_log_problem_on_hyperelliptic_curves","266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","255610834_Algorithms_for_computations_in_Jacobian_group_of_Cab_curve_and_their_application_to_discrete-log-based_public_key_cryptosystems","238770155_The_complexity_of_a_scheme_of_functional_elements_realizing_the_multiplication_of_integers","227184388_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves","225204963_On_Short_Multiplications_and_Divisions","222877053_Computing_Riemann-Roch_Spaces_in_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Related_Topics","221327116_An_Extension_of_Kedlaya's_Point-Counting_Algorithm_to_Superelliptic_Curves","221010711_Fast_Arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_Curves","220770772_A_New_Approach_to_Resultant_Computations_and_Other_Algorithms_with_Exact_Division","220576721_The_arithmetic_of_certain_cubic_function_fields","220161954_A_long_note_on_Mulders'_short_product","220161080_An_Algorithm_for_Exact_Division","46047799_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","29604491_The_arithmetic_of_Jacobian_groups_of_superelliptic_cubics","2621320_A_General_Framework_for_Subexponential_Discrete_Logarithm_Algorithms","2604285_Computing_Discrete_Logarithms_in_High-Genus_Hyperelliptic_Jacobians_in_Provably_Subexponential_Time","2480717_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves","2098977_Linear_algebra_algorithms_for_divisors_on_an_algebraic_curve"]}
