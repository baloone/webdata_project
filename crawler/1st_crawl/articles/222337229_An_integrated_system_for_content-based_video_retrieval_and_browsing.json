{"id":"222337229_An_integrated_system_for_content-based_video_retrieval_and_browsing","abstract":"This paper presents an integrated system solution for computer assisted video parsing and content-based video retrieval and browsing. The effectiveness of this solution lies in its use of video content information derived from a parsing process, being driven by visual feature analysis. That is, parsing will temporally segment and abstract a video source, based on low-level image analyses; then retrieval and browsing of video will be based on key-frame, temporal and motion features of shots. These processes and a set of tools to facilitate content-based video retrieval and browsing using the feature data set are presented in detail as functions of an integrated system.","authors":["Hong Jiang Zhang","Jianhua Wu","Di Zhong","Stephen W.
