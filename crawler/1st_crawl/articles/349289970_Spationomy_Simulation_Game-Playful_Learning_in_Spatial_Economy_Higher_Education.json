{"id":"349289970_Spationomy_Simulation_Game-Playful_Learning_in_Spatial_Economy_Higher_Education","abstract":"Simulation games, as a method of playful learning, have been used for more than 70 years in various disciplines with the economy as a leading application field. Their development has been tied with advances in computer science, and nowadays, hundreds of simulation games exist. However , simulation games are not just useful for encouraging disciplinary knowledge production; they also promise to be effective tools for interdisciplinary collaboration. To further explore these promises , we report on the design and playing of a simulation game on the boundary of geoinformatics and business and economics; an interdisciplinary field we have termed Spationomy. Within this game, students from different disciplinary (and cultural) backgrounds applied their knowledge and skills to tackle interdisciplinary problems. In this paper, we also analyze students' feedback on the game to complement this aspect. The main goal is to discuss the design process that went into creating the game as well as experiences from play sessions in relation to this increase of interdisciplinary knowledge among students. In the end, we present a new gaming concept based on real-world data that can be played in other interdisciplinary situations. Here, students´ feedback on individual features of the game helped to identify future directions in the development of our simulation game.","authors":["Vít Pászto","Jiri Panek","René Glas","Jasper Van Vught"],"meta":["February 2021International Journal of Geo-Information 2021(10):74","DOI:10.3390/ijgi10020074","Project: SPATIONOMY"],"references":["344273701_The_Effect_of_Game-Based_Learning_on_Student_Achievement_A_Meta-Analysis_Study","342581318_Spatial_Exploration_of_Economic_Data-Insight_Into_Attitudes_of_Students_Towards_Interdisciplinary_Knowledge","342390228_Supporting_Disaster_Resilience_Spatial_Thinking_with_Serious_GeoGames_Project_Lily_Pad","339913249_Minecraft_As_A_Tool_for_Engaging_Children_in_Urban_Planning_A_Case_study_in_Tirol_Town_Brazil","339419980_Developing_a_Serious_Game_That_Supports_the_Resolution_of_Social_and_Ecological_Problems_in_the_Toolset_Environment_of_Cities_Skylines","337087339_Spationomy_Simulation_Game","335554481_Realidade_virtual_na_sala_de_aula_pratica_de_ensino_de_Geografia","347588933_INTEGRATION_AND_USE_OF_THE_INTERDISCIPLINARY_KNOWLEDGE_IN_THE_FIELD_OF_SPATIAL_AND_ECONOMICSBUSINESS_SCIENCES","339522239_Spationomy_-_Spatial_Exploration_of_Economic_Data_-_an_Interdisciplinary_Geomatics_ProjectSpationomy_-_Raumliche_Untersuchung_okonomischer_Oaten_-_ein_interdisziplinares_Geomatik-Projekt","335730841_The_Limits_to_Growth"]}
