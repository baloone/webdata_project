{"id":"312216452_A_sequent_calculus_for_the_Tamari_order","abstract":"We introduce a sequent calculus with a simple restriction of Lambek's product rules that precisely captures the classical Tamari order, i.e., the partial order on fully-bracketed words (equivalently, binary trees) induced by a semi-associative law (equivalently, tree rotation). We establish a focusing property for this sequent calculus (a strengthening of cut-elimination), which yields the following coherence theorem: every valid entailment in the Tamari order has exactly one focused derivation. One combinatorial application of this coherence theorem is a new proof of the Tutte-Chapoton formula for the number of intervals in the Tamari lattice $Y_n$. We also apply the sequent calculus and the coherence theorem to build a surprising bijection between intervals of the Tamari order and a certain fragment of lambda calculus, consisting of the $\\beta$-normal planar lambda terms with no closed proper subterms.","authors":["Noam Zeilberger"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["310769577_Planar_triangulations_bridgeless_planar_maps_and_Tamari_intervals","280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","264979636_A_correspondence_between_rooted_planar_maps_and_normal_planar_lambda_terms","229176117_Encoding_pointed_maps_by_double_occurrence_words","325438301_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I","323707969_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","319394668_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","309853257_Tableau_sequences_open_diagrams_and_Baxter_families","303491640_Rotation_distance_triangulations_and_hyperbolic_geometry","291044709_Axiomatic_rewriting_theory_VI_Residual_theory_revisited","287853632_Linear_lambda_terms_as_invariants_of_rooted_trivalent_maps","278048065_Tableau_sequences_open_diagrams_and_Baxter_families","275748872_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction","269890396_Homotopy_Associativity_of_H-Spaces_II","268731304_Monoides_preordonnes_et_chaines_de_Malcev","267655694_Associahedra_Tamari_Lattices_and_Related_Structures_Tamari_Memorial_Festschrift","267110241_A_Census_of_Planar_Triangulations","266860871_Polynomial_Functors_and_Trees","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","248566175_Monoides_preordonnes_et_chaines_de_Malcev","245809779_Counting_rooted_maps_by_genus_III_Nonseparable_maps","242982016_Coherence_for_associativity_not_an_isomorphism","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","240927414_Problemes_d'associativite_Une_structure_de_treillis_finis_induite_par_une_loi_demi-associative","239932230_Focus-preserving_Embeddings_of_Substructural_Logics_in_Intuitionistic_Logic","238766985_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction_II","237131059_Natural_associativity_and_commutativity","235645227_Triangulations_orientals_and_skew_monoidal_categories","230876238_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","222537058_On_the_unity_of_duality","220151993_Description_trees_and_Tutte_Formulas","220078464_Intervals_in_Catalan_lattices_and_realizers_of_triangulations","220077666_Problems_of_Associativity_A_Simple_Proof_for_the_Lattice_Property_of_Systems_Ordered_by_a_Semi-associative_Law","43795471_Graphs_on_Surfaces_and_Their_Applications","23552648_Indecomposable_Permutations_Hypermaps_and_Labeled_Dyck_Paths","2413174_Logic_Programming_with_Focusing_Proofs_in_Linear_Logic","2125950_Sur_le_nombre_d'intervalles_dans_les_treillis_de_Tamari"]}
