{"id":"330893274_Ocular_drift_reflects_volitional_action_preparation","abstract":"Human cognitive behavior is predictive rather than reflexive because of volitional action preparation. Recent studies have shown that the covert process of volitional action preparation can be decoded from overt fixational eye movements of fixational/microsaccades and pupil dilation. Ocular drift, the slowest fixational eye movements, is also under the active neural control, but its relationship with cognitive behavior is unknown. Here, we examined whether ocular drift also reflects volitional action preparation. We analyzed ocular drift while adult humans maintained fixation on a central visual stimulus as they prepared to generate a volitional saccade. We adopted the antisaccade paradigm in which subjects generate a targeting saccade toward the opposite direction of a peripheral visual stimulus. Our findings are the following five points. First, ocular drift was slower when subjects prepared for targeting saccade initiation than when such preparation was unnecessary. Second, ocular drift was slowed down with elapsed time from fixation initiation, which was associated with the facilitation of targeting saccade initiation. Third, ocular drift was further slowed on correct antisaccade trials than when subjects failed to suppress targeting saccades toward peripheral stimuli. Fourth, such correlation with antisaccade performance was observed immediately after fixation initiation in ocular drift, but it emerged more slowly in the other fixational eye movements. Fifth, subjects with unstable fixation because of faster ocular drift had poorer antisaccade performance. We suggest that fixation stability measured by ocular drift can be used to decode the covert process of volitional action preparation along with the other fixational eye movements.\nThis article is protected by copyright.
