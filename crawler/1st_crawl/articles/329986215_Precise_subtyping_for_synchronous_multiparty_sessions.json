{"id":"329986215_Precise_subtyping_for_synchronous_multiparty_sessions","abstract":"This paper proves the soundness and completeness, together referred to as preciseness, of the subtyping relation for a synchronous multiparty session calculus.\nWe address preciseness from operational and denotational viewpoints. The operational preciseness has been recently developed with respect to type safety, i.e., the safe replacement of a process of a smaller type in a context where a process of a bigger type is expected. The denotational preciseness is based on the denotation of a type: a mathematical object describing the meaning of the type, in accordance with the denotations of other expressions from the language.\nThe main technical contribution of this paper is a novel proof strategy for the operational completeness of subtyping. We develop the notion of characteristic global type of a session type T, which describes a deadlock-free circular communication protocol involving all participants appearing in T. We prove operational completeness by showing that, if we place a process not conforming to a subtype of T in a context that matches the characteristic global type of T, then we obtain a deadlock. The denotational preciseness is proved as a corollary of the operational preciseness.","authors":["Silvia Ghilezan","Svetlana Jakšić","Jovanka Pantovic","Alceste Scalas"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 104","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.12.002"],"references":["220431611_Semantic_subtyping_Dealing_set-theoretically_with_function_union_intersection_and_negation_types"]}
