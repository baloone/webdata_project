{"id":"348087265_Computational_Hardness_of_Collective_Coin-Tossing_Protocols","abstract":"Ben-Or and Linial, in a seminal work, introduced the full information model to study collective coin-tossing protocols. Collective coin-tossing is an elegant functionality providing uncluttered access to the primary bottlenecks to achieve security in a specific adversarial model. Additionally, the research outcomes for this versatile functionality has direct consequences on diverse topics in mathematics and computer science. This survey summarizes the current state-of-the-art of coin-tossing protocols in the full information model and recent advances in this field. In particular, it elaborates on a new proof technique that identifies the minimum insecurity incurred by any coin-tossing protocol and, simultaneously, constructs the coin-tossing protocol achieving that insecurity bound. The combinatorial perspective into this new proof-technique yields new coin-tossing protocols that are more secure than well-known existing coin-tossing protocols, leading to new isoperimetric inequalities over product spaces. Furthermore, this proof-techniqueâ€™s algebraic reimagination resolves several long-standing fundamental hardness-of-computation problems in cryptography. This survey presents one representative application of each of these two perspectives.","authors":["Hemanta Maji"],"meta":["December 2020Entropy 23(1):44","DOI:10.3390/e23010044"],"references":["354305652_Efficient_Distributed_Coin-tossing_Protocols","353813939_Computational_Hardness_of_Optimal_Fair_Computation_Beyond_Minicrypt","350144518_A_Tight_Lower_Bound_on_Adaptively_Secure_Full-Information_Coin_Flip","350119613_12_The_Number_of_Simplices_in_a_Complex","344125209_Limits_on_the_Usefulness_of_Random_Oracles","343624236_Black-Box_Use_of_One-Way_Functions_is_Useless_for_Optimal_Fair_Coin-Tossing","338326391_Computational_Concentration_of_Measure_Optimal_Bounds_Reductions_and_More","337460785_Estimating_Gaps_in_Martingales_and_Applications_to_Coin-Tossing_Constructions_and_Hardness","335550591_The_Curse_of_Concentration_in_Robust_Learning_Evasion_and_Poisoning_Attacks_from_Concentration_of_Measure","329392144_Tighter_Bounds_on_Multi-Party_Coin_Flipping_via_Augmented_Weak_Martingales_and_Differentially_Private_Sampling","277292952_Martingales_collective_coin_flipping_and_discrete_control_processes_Extended_Abstract","328731446_On_the_Complexity_of_Fair_Coin_Flipping_16th_International_Conference_TCC_2018_Panaji_India_November_11-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_I","288120040_Coin_flipping_of_any_constant_bias_implies_one-way_functions","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","273158190_Adaptively_Secure_Coin-Flipping_Revisited"]}
