{"id":"221166427_Helping_users_create_better_passwords_is_this_the_right_approach","abstract":"Users tend to form their own mental models of good passwords regardless of any instructions provided. They also tend to favour memorability over security. In our study comparing two mnemonic phrase-based password schemes, we found a surprising number of participants misused both schemes. Intent ional or not, they misused the system such that their task of pas sword creation and memorization became easier. Thus, we believe that instead of better instructions or password schemes, a new appr oach is required to convince users to create more secure pa sswords. One possibility may lie in employing Persuasive Technol ogy.","authors":["Alain Forget","Sonia Chiasson","Robert Biddle"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1280680.1280703","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, SOUPS 2007, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, July 18-20, 2007"],"references":["220427273_Users_Are_Not_the_Enemy","4207371_Have_the_cake_and_eat_it_too_-_Infusing_usability_into_text-password_based_authentication_systems","230877240_Persuasive_Technology_Using_Computers_to_Change_What_We_Think_and_Do","221166436_Human_selection_of_mnemonic_phrase-based_passwords","221022488_A_large-scale_study_of_web_password_habits"]}
