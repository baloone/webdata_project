{"id":"267452173_Compact_McEliece_keys_based_on_quasi-dyadic_Srivastava_codes","abstract":"The McEliece cryptosystem is one of the few systems to be considered secure against attacks\nby Quantum computers. The original scheme is built upon Goppa codes and produces very\nlarge keys, hence recent research has focused mainly on trying to reduce the public key size.\nPrevious proposals tried to replace the class of Goppa codes with other families of codes,\nbut this was revealed to be an insecure choice. In this paper we introduce a construction\nbased on Generalized Srivastava codes, a large class which includes Goppa codes as a special\ncase, that allows relatively short public keys without being vulnerable to known structural\nattacks.","authors":["Edoardo Persichetti"],"meta":["October 2012Journal of Mathematical Cryptology 6(1):149-169","DOI:10.1515/jmc-2011-0099"],"references":["238688932_Goppa_and_Srivastava_codes_over_finite_rings","285864922_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_McEliece_Variants_with_Compact_Keys_-_Towards_a_Complexity_Analysis","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","245900402_Determinants_of_Block_Matrices","243776483_Knapsack_Type_Cryptosystems_and_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","242530120_On_the_complexity_of_decoding_goppa_codes","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","241885294_Explicit_bounds_for_generic_decoding_algorithms_for_code-based_cryptography","238833636_On_the_Inversion_of_Certain_Matrices","237129063_A_public_k_e_y_system_based_on_algebraic_coding_theory"]}
