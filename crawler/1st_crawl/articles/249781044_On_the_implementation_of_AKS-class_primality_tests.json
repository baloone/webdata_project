{"id":"249781044_On_the_implementation_of_AKS-class_primality_tests","abstract":"Algorithms of the new \"cyclotomic AKS class\" determine rigorously and in polynomial time whether an input integer is prime. Herein are discussed implementation is- sues, with a focus on techniques such as asymptotically fast polynomial manipulations, the possible use of floating-point arithmetic, and special powering ladders. We implemented various of the ideas herein on an Apple G4, Mac OS X system, and report performance for one particular AKS variant. We note two performance issues: a) although single-precision vector floats were not employed in this test implementation, double-precision float perfor- mance was quite impressive (we quantify this), and b) there are many additional ways to invoke vectorization, if one so desires, for further speedups.","authors":["R.
