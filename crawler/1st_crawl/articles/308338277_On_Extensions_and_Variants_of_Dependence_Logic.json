{"id":"308338277_On_Extensions_and_Variants_of_Dependence_Logic","abstract":"Dependence logic is a new logic which incorporates the notion of “dependence”, as well as “independence” between variables into first-order logic. In this thesis, we study exten- sions and variants of dependence logic on the first-order, propositional and modal level. In particular, the role of intuitionistic connectives in this setting is emphasized.","authors":["Fan Yang"],"meta":["March 2014","Thesis for: PhDAdvisor: Jouko Väänänen"],"references":["319770913_Intuitionistic_Logic","281233918_Finite_partially-ordered_quantifiers","277288046_Generalized_First-Order_Spectra_and_Polynomial-Time_Recognizable_Sets'","268010803_Semantics_for_a_Class_of_Intuitionistic_Modal_Calculi","267795080_On_Disjunction_in_Modal_Logics","267067395_Dependence_logic_A_new_approach_to_independence_friendly_logic","266213844_The_relation_between_intuitionistic_and_classical_modal_logics","266000551_Informational_Independence_as_a_Semantical_Phenomenon","265594839_Complexity_of_two-variable_dependence_logic_and_IF-logic","265579169_Independence-friendly_logic_A_game-theoretic_approach","258565498_Hierarchies_in_Independence_Logic","262082903_Generalized_Quantifiers_in_Dependence_Logic","259810802_Inquisitive_Semantics_and_Dialogue_Management","258235816_General_Models_and_Entailment_Semantics_for_Independence_Logic","257666108_Epistemic_Operators_in_Dependence_Logic"]}
