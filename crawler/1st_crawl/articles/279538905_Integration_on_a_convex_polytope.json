{"id":"279538905_Integration_on_a_convex_polytope","abstract":"We present an exact formula for integrating a (positively) homogeneous function f on a convex polytope Ω C ⊂ Rn. We show that it suffices to integrate the function on the (n - 1)-dimensional faces of Ω, thus reducing the computational burden. Further properties are derived when f has continuous higher order derivatives. This result can be used to integrate a continuous function after approximation via a polynomial.","authors":["Jean-Bernard Lasserre"],"meta":["August 1998Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 126(8):2433-2441","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9939-98-04454-2","Project: Discrete optimization and Counting"],"references":["287118768_Computing_the_volume_counting_integral_points_and_exponential_sums","266509187_Partial_differential_equations_Basic_theory_pbk-ed","243786784_Points_entiers_dans_les_polydres_convexes","226968588_Barvinok_AI_Computing_the_volume_counting_integral_points_and_exponential_sums_Discrete_Comput_Geom_10_123-141","226516782_An_Analytic_Expression_and_an_Algorithm_for_the_Volume_of_a_Convex_Polyhedron_in_Rn"]}
