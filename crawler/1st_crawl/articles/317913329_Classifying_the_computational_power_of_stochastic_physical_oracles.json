{"id":"317913329_Classifying_the_computational_power_of_stochastic_physical_oracles","abstract":"Earlier we began to develop a computability and complexity theory in which\nthe classical set-theoretic oracle to a Turing machine is replaced by a physical process, and\noracle queries return measurements of physical behaviour. The idea of such physical oracles is\nrelevant to many disparate situations, but in our research we focussed on physical oracles that\nwere classic deterministic experiments which measure physical quantities. In this paper, we\nbroaden the scope of the theory of physical oracles by tackling non-deterministic systems. We\nexamine examples of three types of non-determinism, namely systems that are: (1) physically\nnondeterministic, as in quantum phenomena; (2) physically deterministic but whose physical\ntheory is non-deterministic, as in statistical mechanics; and (3) physically deterministic but\nwhose computational theory is non-deterministic caused by error margins. Physical oracles\nthat have probabilistic theories we call stochastic physical oracles. We propose a set SPO of\naxioms for a basic form of stochastic oracles. We prove that Turing machines equipped with\na physical oracle satisfying the axioms SPO compute precisely the non-uniform complexity\nclass BPP//log* in polynomial time. This result of BPP// log* is a computational limit to a\ngreat range of classical and non-classical measurement, and of analogue-digital computation\nin polynomial time under general conditions.","authors":["Edwin James Beggs","Pedro Cortez","José Félix Costa","John V.
