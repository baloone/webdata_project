A companion to Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age (2007), this book focuses on how learnersâ€™ experiences of learning are changing and raises important challenges to the educational status quo.\n\nChapters are freely available to download from the publisher's website: https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203078952","authors":["Helen Beetham","Rhona J Sharpe"],"meta":["January 2013","Edition: 2ndPublisher: RoutledgeFalmer,Editor: Helen BeethamISBN: 978-0415875431"],"references":[]}
