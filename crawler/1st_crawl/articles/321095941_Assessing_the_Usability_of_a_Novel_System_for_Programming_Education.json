{"id":"321095941_Assessing_the_Usability_of_a_Novel_System_for_Programming_Education","abstract":"The authors present the results of a simple usability test performed on line_explorer, an innovative tool aimed at letting students explore programming. The system offers an interactive environment where students can learn, review, and practice programming independently or through step-by-step instruction. Students in Information Technology, Computer Science, and Information Systems were surveyed. The findings show that students have interest in this tool, whereas some groups find this tool more interesting and useful. The findings will help refine the user interface for the next phase of testing which include changes for simplicity, usability and expanded topic content. Overall the survey on line_explorer in its current design phase seem more useful for IT and CS majors, however significant changes are still needed.","authors":["Giovanni Vincenti","Scott Hilberg","James Braman","Michael Satzinger"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","283656058_Programming_style_in_introductory_programming_courses","279285778_Visualization_of_concepts_and_algorithms_in_programming_education_-_A_design_theoretic_multimodal_perspective","261213953_Teaching_Introductory_Programming_to_IS_Students_The_Impact_of_Teaching_Approaches_on_Learning_Performance","228328491_Learning_to_program_-_difficulties_and_solutions","319395519_Lessons_for_Pedagogic_Usability_of_eLearning_Systems","276442047_Python_for_beginners","271728118_Effects_of_Using_Alice_and_Scratch_in_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_for_Corrective_Instruction","242403127_Design_principles_for_authoring_dynamic","228368593_Determining_What_Individual_SUS_Scores_Mean_Adding_an_Adjective_Rating_Scale"]}
