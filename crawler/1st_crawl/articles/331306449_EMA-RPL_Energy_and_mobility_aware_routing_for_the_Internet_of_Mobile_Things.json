{"id":"331306449_EMA-RPL_Energy_and_mobility_aware_routing_for_the_Internet_of_Mobile_Things","abstract":"Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is a new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) where devices are inherently mobile. While mobility enables innovative applications and allows new services, it remains a challenging issue as it causes disconnection of nodes and intermittent connectivity, which negatively impacts the network operation and performance. In addition, energy saving presents a real challenge for networks with limited resources. In this context, a new energy e�cient and mobility aware routing protocol called EMA-RPL is proposed based on the well-known Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (the RPL standard).\nUnlike the RPL which is basically designed for static devices, EMA-RPL enables better sustaining of connectivity of mobile nodes and conserving energy. The proposed protocol integrates an enhanced mobility detection method through a continuous control of the distance between the mobile node and its attachment, a novel point of attachment prediction based on the new location of the mobile node, and an e�cient replacement strategy preserving the mobile node energy. EMA-RPL overcomes and mitigates problems caused by the mobility of nodes. Simulations using Cooja/Contiki show that EMA-RPL outperforms both the RPL and its mobility aware variant (MRPL) in terms of handover delay, data loss rate, signaling cost and energy consumption.","authors":["Maha Bouaziz","Abderrezak Rachedi","Abdelfettah Belghith","Marion Berbineau"],"meta":["February 2019Future Generation Computer Systems Elsevier","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2019.02.042","Project: Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications: Architectures, Communication protocols, Resource management"],"references":["279254597_RPL_Mobility_Support_for_Point-to-Point_Traffic_Flows_towards_Mobile_Nodes","277339895_Quality-of-service_aware_routing_for_static_and_mobile_IPv6-based_low-power_and_lossy_sensor_networks_using_RPL","272297652_Using_Multiparent_Routing_in_RPL_to_Increase_the_Stability_and_the_Lifetime_of_the_Network","271514745_RPL_IPv6_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","271458153_Co-RPL_RPL_routing_for_mobile_low_power_wireless_sensor_networks_using_Corona_mechanism","269269317_Mobility_Enhanced_RPL_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","268691242_MRPL_Boosting_mobility_in_the_Internet_of_Things","258388365_A_Comprehensive_Evaluation_of_RPL_under_Mobility","236860639_Application_of_modified_RPL_under_VANET-WSN_communication_architecture","224153100_RPL_Based_Routing_for_Advanced_Metering_Infrastructure_in_Smart_Grid","41392302_Interconnection_between_802154_Devices_and_IPv6_Implications_and_Existing_Approaches","319118757_A_Reinforcement_Learning-based_Link_Quality_Estimation_Strategy_for_RPL_and_its_Impact_on_Topology_Management","309762767_EC-MRPL_An_energy-efficient_and_mobility_support_routing_protocol_for_Internet_of_Mobile_Things","309762552_A_Secure_Routing_Protocol_Based_on_RPL_for_Internet_of_Things","300408091_Low-power_and_Lossy_Networks_under_mobility_a_survey","295858864_End-to-End_Security_Scheme_for_Mobility_Enabled_Healthcare_Internet_of_Things","290583322_6LoWPAN_The_Wireless_Embedded_Internet","275381481_MoMoRo_Providing_Mobility_Support_for_Low-Power_Wireless_Applications","266829755_A_Survey_on_Mobility_Management_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_based_on_6LoWPAN_Technology","262162021_Extending_the_Internet_of_Things_to_the_Future_Internet_Through_IPv6_Support","261499650_Supporting_monitoring_applications_with_mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_The_eN_Route_forwarding_approach","261197100_Survey_of_Internet_of_Things_Technologies_for_Clinical_Environments","257582309_RPL_in_a_nutshell_A_survey","226853707_Realistic_Applications_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","221284151_Low-power_wireless_IPv6_routing_with_ContikiRPL","220547925_Routing_and_mobility_approaches_in_IPv6_over_LoWPAN_mesh_networks"]}
