The flat spaces of PG(k−1, q) may be characterized by the followingTheorem. If F is a set of points in PG(k−1, q) which has a non-empty intersection with every v-flat, then the number of points in F is greater than or equal to (qk−v−1)/(q−1). Equality holds if, and only if, F is a (k−v, −1)-flat.It may be shown from this theorem that the Hamming codes which maximize n for a given redundancy r, q=2, and minimum distance d=4, are unique. An extension of the theorem shows that the MacDonald codes with d=qk−1−qu (u=0, 1, …, k−2) are unique.","authors":["R.C. Bose","R.C.
