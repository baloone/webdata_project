{"id":"336494731_Blockchain_technology_in_supply_chain_management_for_sustainable_performance_Evidence_from_the_airport_industry","abstract":"This paper investigates the major implications of blockchain technology for operations management (OM) with a\nfocus on the decision-making processes in supply chain management (SCM) from the perspective of sustainable\nperformance. The links between blockchain technology, OM, and sustainability issues within SCM are analysed.\nThis two-step research study includes a broad review of the main contributions in the literature that have\nfocused on blockchain technology and OM in SCM. It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sustainable\nperformance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports,\nand the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure investigated\nsuccessfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the\nmain blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main\nplayers in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and\nuncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high\nlevel of sustainable performance.\nAlthough the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM,\nthese new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of effectiveness,\nefficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a\nreal forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article\nadds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and\nsustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy.","authors":["Assunta
