{"id":"37596691_Teaching_Children_Thinking","abstract":"This paper is dedicated to the hope that someone with power to act will one day see that contemporary research on education is like the following experiment by a nineteenth century engineer who worked to demonstrate that engines were better than horses. This he did by hitching a 1/8 HP motor in parallel with his team of four strong stallions. After a year of statistical research he announced a significant difference. However, it was generally thought that there was a Hawthorne effect on the horses.","authors":["Seymour Papert"],"meta":["September 1972Innovations in Education and Training International 5(3)","DOI:10.1080/1355800720090503"],"references":["237104489_Teaching_Children_to_be_Mathematicians_Versus_Teaching_About_Mathematics"]}
