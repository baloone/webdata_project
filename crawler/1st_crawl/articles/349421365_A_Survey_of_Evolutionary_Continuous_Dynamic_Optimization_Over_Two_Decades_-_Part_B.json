{"id":"349421365_A_Survey_of_Evolutionary_Continuous_Dynamic_Optimization_Over_Two_Decades_-_Part_B","abstract":"This paper presents the second part of a two-part survey that reviews evolutionary dynamic optimization for singleobjective unconstrained continuous problems over the last two decades. While in the first part we reviewed the components of dynamic optimization algorithms, in this part, we present an indepth review of the most commonly used benchmark problems, performance analysis methods, static optimization methods used in the framework of dynamic optimization algorithms, and realworld applications. Compared to the previous works, this paper provides a new taxonomy for the benchmark problems used in the field based on their baseline functions and dynamics. In addition, this survey classifies the commonly used performance indicators into fitness/error based and efficiency based ones. Different types of plots used in the literature for analyzing the performance and behavior of algorithms are also reviewed. Furthermore, the static optimization algorithms which are modified and utilized in the framework of dynamic optimization algorithms as the optimization components are covered. We then comprehensively review some real-world dynamic problems which are optimized by evolutionary dynamic optimization methods. Finally, some challenges and opportunities are pointed out for future directions.","authors":["Danial Yazdani","Ran Cheng","Donya Yazdani","Jurgen Branke"],"meta":["February 2021IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2021.3060012"],"references":["343384072_A_Species_Conservation-Based_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_with_Local_Search_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","343049791_Benchmarking_Continuous_Dynamic_Optimization_Survey_and_Generalized_Test_Suite","342759413_Time_series_forecasting_with_feedforward_neural_networks_trained_using_particle_swarm_optimizers_for_dynamic_environments","346815843_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Theory_and_Practice_Evolution_Strategies_Evolutionary_Programming_Genetic_AlgorithmsEvolution_Strategies_Evolutionary_Programming_Genetic_Algorithms","345355960_A_multi-population_differential_evolution_algorithm_based_on_cellular_learning_automata_and_evolutionary_context_information_for_optimization_in_dynamic_environments","344655020_A_note_on_the_exclusion_operator_in_multi-swarm_PSO_algorithms_for_dynamic_environments","340356002_Ensemble_framework_by_using_nature_inspired_algorithms_for_the_early-stage_forest_fire_rescue_-_A_case_study_of_dynamic_optimization_problems","339549518_A_Survey_of_Hyper-heuristics_for_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","339473208_mBSO_A_Multi-Population_Brain_Storm_Optimization_for_Multimodal_Dynamic_Optimization_Problems","336662834_Dual-archive-based_particle_swarm_optimization_for_dynamic_optimization"]}
