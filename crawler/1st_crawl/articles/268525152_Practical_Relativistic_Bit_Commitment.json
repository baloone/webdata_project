{"id":"268525152_Practical_Relativistic_Bit_Commitment","abstract":"Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which Alice wishes\nto commit a secret bit to Bob. Perfectly secure bit commitment between two\nmistrustful parties is impossible through asynchronous exchange of quantum\ninformation. Perfect security is however possible when Alice and Bob each split\ninto several agents exchanging classical information at times and locations\nsuitably chosen to satisfy specific relativistic constraints. In this Letter we\nfirst revisit a previously proposed scheme that realizes bit commitment using\nonly classical communication. We prove that the protocol is secure against\nquantum adversaries for a duration limited by the light-speed communication\ntime between the locations of the agents. We then propose a novel multi-round\nscheme based on finite-field arithmetic that extends the commitment time beyond\nthis limit, and we prove its security against classical attacks. Finally, we\npresent an implementation of these protocols using dedicated hardware and we\nshow how it could be used to realize commitments of duration ranging up to 212\nmilliseconds by agents occupying antipodal locations on the Earth.","authors":["Tommaso Lunghi","Jędrzej Kaniewski","Félix Bussières","Raphael Houlmann"],"meta":["November 2014Physical Review Letters 115(3)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.030502","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260004461_Experimental_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment","239939662_Experimental_Bit_Commitment_Based_on_Quantum_Communication_and_Special_Relativity","230613800_Security_Details_for_Bit_Commitment_by_Transmitting_Measurement_Outcomes","265793270_Advances_in_Cryptology_-_ASIACRYPT_2011_-_17th_International_Conference_on_the_Theory_and_Application_of_Cryptology_and_Information_Security_Seoul_South_Korea_December_4-8_2011_Proceedings","263002630_Strong_connections_between_quantum_encodings_nonlocality_and_quantum_cryptography","258699505_Information_Causality_Szemer'edi-Trotter_and_Algebraic_Variants_of_CHSH","250373195_Classical_and_quantum_strategies_for_bit_commitment_schemes_in_the_two-prover_model","235597698_Causality_and_Tsirelson's_bounds","231816354_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_by_Transmitting_Measurement_Outcomes","225284605_Secure_Bit_Commitment_From_Relativistic_Constraints"]}
