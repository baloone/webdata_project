{"id":"276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","abstract":"The \\(k\\) -colouring reconfiguration problem asks whether, for a given graph \\(G\\) , two proper \\(k\\) -colourings \\(\\alpha \\) and \\(\\beta \\) of \\(G\\) , and a positive integer \\(\\ell \\) , there exists a sequence of at most \\(\\ell +1\\) proper \\(k\\) -colourings of \\(G\\) which starts with \\(\\alpha \\) and ends with \\(\\beta \\) and where successive colourings in the sequence differ on exactly one vertex of \\(G\\) . We give a complete picture of the parameterized complexity of the \\(k\\) -colouring reconfiguration problem for each fixed \\(k\\) when parameterized by \\(\\ell \\) . First we show that the \\(k\\) -colouring reconfiguration problem is polynomial-time solvable for \\(k=3\\) , settling an open problem of Cereceda, van den Heuvel and Johnson. Then, for all \\(k \\ge 4\\) , we show that the \\(k\\) -colouring reconfiguration problem, when parameterized by \\(\\ell \\) , is fixed-parameter tractable (addressing a question of Mouawad, Nishimura, Raman, Simjour and Suzuki) but that it has no polynomial kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.","authors":["Matthew Johnson","Dieter Kratsch","Stefan Kratsch","Viresh Patel"],"meta":["May 2015Algorithmica 8894(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-015-0009-7"],"references":["264708930_Homomorphism_reconfiguration_via_homotopy","260295061_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","302917812_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","282844715_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs_and_their_Generalizations","261726425_Reconfiguration_of_List_L21-Labelings_in_a_Graph","261289085_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","260107740_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs"]}
