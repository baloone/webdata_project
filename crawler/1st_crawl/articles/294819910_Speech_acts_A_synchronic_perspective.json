{"id":"294819910_Speech_acts_A_synchronic_perspective","abstract":"Introduction Corpus-based speech act studies have traditionally employed a methodology in which words and phrases, predetermined by the researcher to have pragmatic meaning, are searched in a corpus to identify speech acts (e.g., Aijmer 1996, Jiang 2006, Adolphs 2008, Aijmer 2008, Butler 2008, Cheng 2010). For example, a researcher might identify the speech act of apology by searching for the use of the word sorry. This methodology has been used to identify direct speech acts, as in please close the door, and indirect speech acts, as in it might help to close the door (for more examples, see Levinson 1983: 264â€“265). It has been argued that the nonconventional nature of indirect speech acts in natural language makes it difficult for researchers to identify speech acts using lexical search approaches because pre-identified words carrying pragmatic meaning are not used in all cases (Levinson 1983, Garcia 2004, Kohnen 2009). It can also be argued that some indirect speech acts are conventionally phrased, such as the use of can you to begin speech acts of request, hence facilitating the identification of speech acts by searching for this phrase. However, the identification of speech acts through lexical search techniques is limited to only the forms and phrases that the researcher predicts will carry pragmatic meaning and cannot account for the full range of linguistic forms that are possible, specifically those that the researcher has not predicted to include pragmatic meaning. This problem raises the question: If research on naturally occurring, indirect speech acts cannot be done thoroughly using corpus-based lexical search methods, how can corpus tools and techniques advance the study of speech acts? For one thing, once speech acts are identified in a corpus, corpus tools allow us to look at hundreds of instances of a particular speech act in a single analysis whereby we can begin to examine frequency, usage trends, and surrounding co-text. Secondly, by using computer programming techniques, corpus-based analyses can provide information on linguistic features, grammatical structure, and discourse patterns for a multitude of speech act realizations. Thirdly, computerized spoken corpora can provide information on interlocutors and situations allowing researchers to see who is saying what to whom, and in what context; and language in context is at the heart of pragmatics research.","authors":["P.G.
