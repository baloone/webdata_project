{"id":"325725929_Deep_Learning_for_Intelligent_Wireless_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Survey","abstract":"As a promising machine learning tool to handle the accurate pattern recognition from complex raw data, deep learning (DL) is becoming a powerful method to add intelligence to wireless networks with large-scale topology and complex radio conditions. DL uses many neural network layers to achieve a brain-like acute feature extraction from high-dimensional raw data. It can be used to find the network dynamics (such as hotspots, interference distribution, congestion points, traffic bottlenecks, spectrum availability, etc.) based on the analysis of a large amount of network parameters (such as delay, loss rate, link SNR, etc.). Therefore, DL can analyze extremely complex wireless networks with many nodes and dynamic link quality. This article performs a comprehensive survey of the applications of DL algorithms for different network layers, including physical layer modulation/coding, data link layer access control/resource allocation, and routing layer path search and traffic balancing. The use of DL to enhance other network functions, such as network security, sensing data compression, etc., is also discussed. Moreover, the challenging unsolved research issues in this field are discussed in detail, which represent the future research trends of DL-based wireless networks. This article can help the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art of the DL-based wireless network designs, and select interesting unsolved issues to pursue in their research.","authors":["Qian Mao","Fei Hu","Qi Hao"],"meta":["June 2018IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials
