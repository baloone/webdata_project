{"id":"313159796_Study_of_Artificial_IntelligenceAI_with_Augmented_RealityAR","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence is the subarea of Computer Science, which deals with making machines work like humans. The concept of artificial intelligence has almost overruled the concept of typing on various Search Engine tools, rather people are interacting with computers like they interact with the humans. They give command to the systems and the systems respond accordingly, as humans does. So this artificial field has immensely grown in this real world. Nowadays a new concept has evolved i.e augmented reality. It means integrating the virtual things with the real environment. It is basically a sixth generation technology , which provides a real interface of virtual objects.Earlier it was not very much used but these days people are using this technology for education, for hospitals and in various other fields.This paper deals with the significance of integrating the technologies together.","authors":["Apoorva Jain"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":[]}
