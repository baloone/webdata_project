{"id":"323718901_Path_Planning_for_Robot_based_on_Chaotic_Artificial_Potential_Field_Method","abstract":"Robot path planning in unknown environments is one of the hot research topics in the field of robot control. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional artificial potential field methods, we propose a new path planning for Robot based on chaotic artificial potential field method. The path planning adopts the potential function as the objective function and introduces the robot direction of movement as the control variables, which combines the improved artificial potential field method with chaotic optimization algorithm. Simulations have been carried out and the results demonstrate that the superior practicality and high efficiency of the proposed method.","authors":["Cheng Zhang"],"meta":["March 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 317(1):012056","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/317/1/012056"],"references":["247161853_Robot_Motion_Planning","3299070_New_potential_functions_for_mobile_robot_path_planning"]}
