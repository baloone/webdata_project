{"id":"319993469_Experiential_Metaphors_in_Abstract_Games","abstract":"Despite their age and prevalence, abstract games are often overlooked in contemporary discussions of games and meaning. In this paper I offer experiential metaphors as a critical method applicable to all games, particularly abstract games. To do this I introduce structural metaphors, image schemata and experiential gestalts to explain how experiential metaphors function. I then compare this method with the simulation gap (Bogost 2006, 2007) and show how the two relate. I close with two examples of abstract games that function as experiential metaphors.","authors":["Jason Begy"],"meta":["April 2013Transactions of the Digital Games Research Association 1(1)","DOI:10.26503/todigra.v1i1.3"],"references":["273947205_Games_without_frontiers_Theories_and_Methods_for_Game_Studies_and_Design","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","273947440_God_of_War_II","273947381_Super_Mario_Bros","273946593_Persuasive_Games_Puzzling_the_Sublime","263565704_Simulation_Versus_Narrative_Introduction_to_Ludology","235933543_Past_the_Tipping_Point_The_Persistence_of_Firefighting_in_Product_Development","220200738_The_Gaming_Situation","200026090_Semiotics_The_Basics","31760815_Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck_the_Future_of_Narrative_in_Cyberspace_JH_Murray"]}
