{"id":"222479972_Bisimulation-invariant_PTIME_and_higher-dimensional_m-calculus","abstract":"Consider the class of all those properties of worlds in finite Kripke structures (or of states in finite transition systems), that are •• recognizable in polynomial time, and•• closed under bisimulation equivalence.\nIt is shown that the class of these bisimulation-invariant Ptime queries has a natural logical characterization. It is captured by the straightforward extension of propositional μ-calculus to arbitrary finite dimension. Bisimulation-invariant Ptime, or the modal fragment of Ptime, thus proves to be one of the very rare cases in which a logical characterization is known in a setting of unordered structures. It is also shown that higher-dimensional μ-calculus is undecidable for satisfiability in finite structures, and even ∑11-hard over general structures.","authors":["Martin Otto"],"meta":["August 1999Theoretical Computer Science 224(1-2):237-265","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00314-4"],"references":["277288283_Logic_and_the_Challenge_of_Computer_Science","242949311_Remarks_on_Berger's_paper_on_the_domino_problem","221590198_The_Complexity_of_Relational_Query_Languages_Extended_Abstract","220687918_The_Classical_Decision_Problem","200034163_Generic_Computation_and_its_Complexity","2646692_On_the_Expressive_Completeness_of_the_Propositional_Mu-Calculus_With_Respect_to_Monadic_Second_Order_Logic","331923256_Finite_Model_Theory","299722887_Finite_Automata_and_Logic_A_Microcosm_of_Finite_Model_Theory","254853007_Modal_Correspondence_Theory","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","243596277_Modal_Logic_and_Classical_Logic","243512950_Recurring_Dominoes_Making_the_Highly_Undecidable_Highly_Understandable","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem","239585139_Bounded_Variable_Logics_and_Counting_A_Study_in_Finite_Models","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","230625814_Temporal_and_Modal_Logic","227064636_Modal_Correspondence_for_Models","226943032_A_finite_model_theorem_for_the_propositional_-calculus","226161192_Deciding_bisimilarity_isP-complete","225997902_Undecidability_results_on_two-variable_logics","225712812_Undecidability_results_on_two-variable_logics","222469166_Fixed-point_extensions_of_first-order_logic","222451435_Relational_Queries_Computable_in_Polynomial_Time","222441891_Structure_and_Complexity_of_Relational_Queries","222117900_An_automata_theoretic_decision_procedure_for_the_propositional_mu-calculus","222080085_Canonization_for_two_variables_and_puzzles_on_the_square","221557866_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220896827_Results_on_the_Propositional_m-Calculus","220854942_Concurrency_and_Automata_on_Infinite_Sequences","220827100_A_Decision_Procedure_for_the_Propositional_-Calculus","220688100_A_Calculus_of_Communicating_System","220431030_Effective_transformations_on_infinite_trees_with_applications_to_high_undecidability_dominoes_and_fairness","38383710_The_Expressive_Power_of_Fixed-Point_Logic_with_Counting","37705077_Vicious_Circles","2808989_Interpolation_Preservation_and_Pebble_Games","2774608_Infinitary_Logic_and_Inductive_Definability_Over_Finite_Structures","2727211_Bounded_Variable_Logics_Two_Three_and_More","2710204_On_Linear_Ordering_of_Strongly_Extensional_Finitely-Branching_Graphs_and_Non-Well-Founded_Sets","2455451_Inductive_Definability_with_Counting_on_Finite_Structures"]}
