{"id":"337895250_Inequalities_by_Means_of_Generalized_Proportional_Fractional_Integral_Operators_with_Respect_to_Another_Function","abstract":"In this article, we define a new fractional technique which is known as generalized proportional fractional (GPF) integral in the sense of another function Ψ. The authors prove several inequalities for newly defined GPF-integral with respect to another function Ψ. Our consequences will give noted outcomes for a suitable variation to the GPF-integral in the sense of another function Ψ and the proportionality index ς. Furthermore, we present the application of the novel operator with several integral inequalities. A few new properties are exhibited, and the numerical approximation of these new operators is introduced with certain utilities to real-world problems.","authors":["Saima Rashid","Fahd Jarad","Muhammad Aslam Noor","Humaira Kalsoom"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7121225"],"references":["336851588_Certain_inequalities_via_generalized_proportional_Hadamard_fractional_integral_operators","335578135_Some_Estimates_for_Generalized_Riemann-Liouville_Fractional_Integrals_of_Exponentially_Convex_Functions_and_Their_Applications","334697187_Simpsons_type_integral_inequalities_for_kappa-fractional_integrals_and_their_applications","334471869_The_Minkowski_inequalities_via_generalized_proportional_fractional_integral_operators","334192995_Some_Generalize_Reimann-Liouville_Fractional_Estimates_Involving_Functions_Having_Exponentially_Convexity_Property","333877885_Integral_inequalities_for_generalized_preinvex_functions","332352838_A_Gronwall_inequality_via_the_generalized_proportional_fractional_derivative_with_applications","324149660_On_Fuzzy_Ordered_LA-Semihypergroups","326536462_Generalized_fractional_derivatives_generated_by_a_class_of_local_proportional_derivatives","325288236_Integral_inequalities_for_Riemann-Liouville_fractional_integrals_of_a_function_with_respect_to_another_function"]}
