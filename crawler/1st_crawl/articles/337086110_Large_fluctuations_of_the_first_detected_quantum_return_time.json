{"id":"337086110_Large_fluctuations_of_the_first_detected_quantum_return_time","abstract":"How long does it take a quantum particle to return to its origin? As shown previously under repeated projective\nmeasurements aimed to detect the return, the closed cycle yields a geometrical phase which shows that the\naverage first detected return time is quantized. For critical sampling times or when parameters of the Hamiltonian\nare tuned this winding number is modified. These discontinuous transitions exhibit gigantic fluctuations of the\nreturn time. While the general formalism of this problem was studied at length, the magnitude of the fluctuations,\nwhich is quantitatively essential, remains poorly characterized. Here, we derive explicit expressions for the\nvariance of the return time, for quantum walks in finite Hilbert space. A classification scheme of the diverging\nvariance is presented, for four different physical effects: the Zeno regime, when the overlap of an energy\neigenstate and the detected state is small, and when two or three phases of the problem merge. These scenarios\npresent distinct physical effects which can be analyzed with the fluctuations of return times investigated here,\nleading to a topology-dependent time-energy uncertainty principle.","authors":["Ruoyu Yin","K.
