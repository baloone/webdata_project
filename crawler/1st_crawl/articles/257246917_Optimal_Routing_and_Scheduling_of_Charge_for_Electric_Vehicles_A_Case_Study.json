{"id":"257246917_Optimal_Routing_and_Scheduling_of_Charge_for_Electric_Vehicles_A_Case_Study","abstract":"In Colombia, there is an increasing interest about improving public\ntransportation. One of the proposed strategies in that way is the use battery\nelectric vehicles (BEVs). One of the new challenges is the BEVs routing\nproblem, which is subjected to the traditional issues of the routing problems,\nand must also consider the particularities of autonomy, charge and battery\ndegradation of the BEVs. In this work, a scheme that coordinates the routing,\nscheduling of charge and operating costs of BEVs is proposed. The simplified\noperating costs have been modeled considering both charging fees and battery\ndegradation. A case study is presented, in order to illustrate the proposed\nmethodology. The given case considers an airport shuttle service scenario, in\nwhich energy consumption of the BEVs is estimated based on experimentally\nmeasured driving patterns.","authors":["John Barco Jiménez","Andres Guerra","Luis Muñoz","Nicanor Quijano"],"meta":["November 2017Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2017","DOI:10.1155/2017/8509783","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273758258_Decentralized_Charging_Control_of_Large_Populations_of_Plug-in_Electric_Vehicles","317415397_Optimal_decentralized_protocol_for_electric_vehicle_charging","312441784_Solving_the_battery_swap_station_location-routing_problem_with_capacitated_electric_vehicles_using_an_AVNS_algorithm_for_vehicle-routing_problems_with_intermediate_stops","309621232_Exact_Algorithms_for_Electric_Vehicle-Routing_Problems_with_Time_Windows","302971975_Integration_of_sampling_based_battery_state_of_health_estimation_method_in_electric_vehicles","297708769_Combinatorial_optimization_for_electric_vehicles_management","297610533_The_Electric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","290429368_The_Electric_Fleet_Size_and_Mix_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Recharging_Stations","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","273478235_Routing_a_mixed_fleet_of_electric_and_conventional_vehicles"]}
