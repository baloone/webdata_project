{"id":"200787077_Applications_of_Exponential_Decay_and_Geometric_Series_in_Effective_Medicine_Dosage","abstract":"The problem facing by physicians is the fact that for most drugs there is a minimum concentration below which the drug is ineffective, and a maximum con-centration above which the drug is dangerous. Thus, this paper discusses the effective medicine dosage and its concentration in bloodstream of a patient. For analysis of dose concentration and mathematical mo- delling of minimum and maximum concentration of a drug administered intravenously, the EDM (Expo-nential Decay Model) and GSF (Geometric Series and its Formula) are the powerful mathematical tools. In the present research study, these two mathematical tools were used to predict the dose concentration of a drug in bloodstream of a patient.","authors":["C.
