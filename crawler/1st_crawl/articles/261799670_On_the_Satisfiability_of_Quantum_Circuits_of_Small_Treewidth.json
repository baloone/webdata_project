{"id":"261799670_On_the_Satisfiability_of_Quantum_Circuits_of_Small_Treewidth","abstract":"It has been known since long time that many NP-hard optimization problems can\nbe solved in polynomial time when restricted to structures of constant\ntreewidth. In this work we provide the first extension of such results to the\nquantum setting. We show that given a quantum circuit $C$ with $n$\nuninitialized inputs, $poly(n)$ gates and treewidth $t$, one can compute in\ntime $(\\frac{n}{\\delta})^{\\exp(O(t))}$ a classical witness $y\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$\nthat maximizes the acceptance probability of $C$ up to a $\\delta$ additive\nfactor. In particular our algorithm runs in polynomial time if $t$ is constant\nand $1/poly(n) \\leq \\delta < 1$. For unrestricted values of $t$ this problem is\nknown to be hard for the complexity class QCMA, a quantum generalization of NP.\nIn contrast, we show that the same problem is already NP-hard if $t=O(\\log n)$\neven when $\\delta$ is constant. Finally, we show that for $t=O(\\log n)$ and\nconstant $\\delta$, it is QMA-hard to find a quantum witness $\\ket{\\varphi}$\nthat maximizes the acceptance probability of a quantum circuit of treewidth $t$\nup to a $\\delta$ additive factor.","authors":["Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira"],"meta":["August 2017Theory of Computing Systems 61(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9727-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268844010_Some_Classes_of_Graphs_with_Bounded_Treewidth","301870213_Succinct_quantum_proofs_for_properties_of_finite_groups","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition","265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","262981166_On_the_Satisfiability_of_Quantum_Circuits_of_Small_Treewidth","248447612_Width-Based_Algorithms_for_SAT_and_CIRCUIT-SAT","245665156_Classical_and_Quantum_Computation","234005110_QMA-complete_problems","230595835_Complexity_of_Finding_Embeddings_in_a_k-Tree","226641664_Call_routing_and_the_ratcatcher","225521740_NC-Algorithms_for_Graphs_with_Small_Treewidth","222672458_Cutwidth_I_A_linear_time_fixed_parameter_algorithm","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","222460352_Easy_Problems_for_Tree-Decomposable_Graphs","222447584_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_I_Recognizable_sets_of_finite_graphs"]}
