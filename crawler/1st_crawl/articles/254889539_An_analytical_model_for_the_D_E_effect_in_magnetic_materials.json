{"id":"254889539_An_analytical_model_for_the_D_E_effect_in_magnetic_materials","abstract":"The Delta E effect is often presented as the dependency of the Young's modulus of a material on its state of magnetization. Nevertheless, the elastic properties of a magnetic material do not depend on the magnetization state. Actually, the sensitivity of the magnetostriction strain to the application of a stress explains the Delta E effect. According to this statement, a semi-analytical model for the Delta E effect is proposed, in which magnetization rotation is not considered. An experimental procedure to measure the Delta E effect in magnetic materials is then built-up. Experimental and modeling results are finally compared, with satisfying agreement.","authors":["Laurent Daniel","Olivier Hubert"],"meta":["March 2009The European Physical Journal Applied Physics 45(3)","DOI:10.1051/epjap/2009012"],"references":["228708303_Application_of_piezo-magnetism_for_the_measurement_of_stress_during_an_impact","329838214_Multiscale_modelling_of_the_magnetostrictive_behaviour_of_electrical_steels_-_demagnetising_surface_effect_and_texture_gradient","284790718_Introduction_to_Magnetic_Materials","281131717_Multiscale_strategy_for_the_determination_of_magneto-elastic_behaviour_Discussion_and_application_to_Ni-Zn_ferrites","258999632_Introduction_to_Magnetism_and_Magnetic_Materials","253398480_Phenomenological_model_for_magnetization_magnetostriction_and_DE_effect_in_field-annealed_amorphous_ribbons","243777236_Magnetostriction_Theory_and_Applications_of_Magnetoelasticity","237639352_Effect_of_plastic_straining_on_magnetostriction_of_ferromagnetic_polycrystals-experiments_and_multiscale_modeling","223907612_Multiscale_modeling_of_the_magneto-mechanical_behavior_of_grain-oriented_silicon_steels","222930346_Magnetomechanical_Measurements_and_Their_Application_to_Soft_Magnetic_Materials"]}
