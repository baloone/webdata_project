{"id":"343963965_Knowledge_Framework_and_Evolution_of_Fuzzy_Portfolio_Research_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","abstract":"Recently, wide applications of fuzzy set theory have attracted the attention of both researchers and practitioners. Fuzzy portfolio develops as a new area in the research field of investment portfolio. This paper investigates the major research hotspots, development trend, and evolution of fuzzy portfolio, which provides a systematic review of the current fuzzy portfolio literature. CiteSpace, the most commonly used bibliometrics software, is used in this article. According to the 602 articles with 15132 references, several conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) Fuzzy portfolio becomes increasingly interdisciplinary with the connections among “Computer Science” and so on. (2) Most contributive authors are Markowitz and Zadeh. (3) South China University of Technology makes excellent performance in this research area and China is the most influential country. (4) European Journal of Operations Research is the cradle of plenty of crucial fuzzy portfolio investigations. (5) We find some research hotspots helpful to make scientific predictions of future trends by analyzing the keywords. By utilizing the effective bibliometric methods, we provide a comprehensive analysis and deep insights into the fuzzy portfolio research, enabling the individuals, especially the new beginners who are interested in this area to learn fuzzy portfolio, which will be of great help for their future explorations.","authors":["Wei Zhou","Qinen Gu","Dongping Yu"],"meta":["August 2020Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2020(1):1-18","DOI:10.1155/2020/3067461"],"references":["326329651_Possibilistic_Moment_Models_for_Multi-period_Portfolio_Selection_with_Fuzzy_Returns","317251175_Climate_change_and_tourism_a_scientometric_analysis_using_CiteSpace","309875800_A_hybrid_FA-SA_algorithm_for_fuzzy_portfolio_selection_with_transaction_costs","346790326_Fuzzy_sets_as_a_basis_for_a_theory_of_possibility","345721318_A_review_of_uncertain_portfolio_selection","330664142_Portfolio_allocation_with_the_TODIM_method","329977846_A_prospect_theory-based_group_decision_approach_considering_consensus_for_portfolio_selection_with_hesitant_fuzzy_information","326974421_Supply_chain_finance_A_systematic_literature_review_and_bibliometric_analysis","315904520_Bibliometric_analysis_on_the_association_between_behavioral_finance_and_decision_making_with_cognitive_biases_such_as_overconfidence_anchoring_effect_and_confirmation_bias","311994850_A_new_fuzzy_multi-objective_higher_order_moment_portfolio_selection_model_for_diversified_portfolios","307901959_Fuzzy_multi-period_portfolio_selection_model_with_discounted_transaction_costs","276404713_UM_MODELO_FUZZY-DEA-GAME_PARA_ESTRATEGIAS_DE_PRODUCAO_SOB_INCERTEZA","265233311_A_Fuzzy_Approach_to_Portfolio_Selection","284978195_Fuzzy_portfolio_optimization_under_downside_risk_measures","279272290_Portfolio_Selection"]}
