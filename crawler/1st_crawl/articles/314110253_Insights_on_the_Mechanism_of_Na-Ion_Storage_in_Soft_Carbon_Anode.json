{"id":"314110253_Insights_on_the_Mechanism_of_Na-Ion_Storage_in_Soft_Carbon_Anode","abstract":"Graphite is the commercial anode for lithium-ion batteries; however, it fails to extend its success to sodium-ion batteries. Recently, we demonstrated that a low-cost amorphous carbonâ€”soft carbon exhibits remarkable rate performance and stable cycling life of Na-ion storage. However, its Na-ion storage mechanism has remained elusive, which has plagued further development of such carbon anodes. Here, we remedy this shortfall by presenting the results from an integrated set of experimental and computational studies that, for the first time, reveal the storage mechanism for soft carbon. We find that sodium-ions intercalate into graphenic layers, leading to an irreversible quasi-plateau at ~ 0.5 V vs. Na+/Na as well as an irreversible expansion seen by in situ TEM and XRD. Such a high-potential plateau is correlated to the defective local structure inside the turbostratic stacking of soft carbon and the associated high binding energies with Na-ions, suggesting a trapping mechanism. On the other hand, soft carbon exhibits long sloping regions above and below the quasi-plateau during the first sodiation, where the sloping regions present highly reversible behavior. It is attributed to the more defects contained by soft carbon revealed by neutron total scattering and the associated pair distribution function studies.","authors":["Zelang Jian","Clement Bommier","Langli Luo","Zhifei Li"],"meta":["February 2017Chemistry of Materials 29(5)","DOI:10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b05474"],"references":["284561131_Electrochemically_Expandable_Soft_Carbon_as_Anodes_for_Na-Ion_Batteries","283810279_A_superior_low-cost_amorphous_carbon_anode_made_from_pitch_and_lignin_for_sodium-ion_batteries","268502034_Room-Temperature_Stationary_Sodium-Ion_Batteries_for_Large-Scale_Electric_Energy_Storage","262846730_Expanded_graphite_as_superior_anode_for_sodium-ion_batteries","259201677_Nitrogen_doped_porous_carbon_fibres_as_anode_materials_for_sodium_ion_batteries_with_excellent_rate_performance","234973209_Phospho-Olivines_as_Positive-Electrode_Materials_for_Rechargeable_Lithium_Batteries","227552576_Lithium_Storage_in_Ordered_Mesoporous_Carbon_CMK-3_with_High_Reversible_Specific_Energy_Capacity_and_Good_Cycling_Performance","225188263_Efficient_Iterative_Schemes_for_Ab_Initio_Total-Energy_Calculations_Using_a_Plane-Wave_Basis_Set","201877759_From_Ultrasoft_Pseudopotentials_to_the_Projector_Augmented-Wave_Method","43347348_A_Consistent_and_Accurate_Ab_Initio_Parametrization_of_Density_Functional_Dispersion_Correction_DFT-D_for_the_94_Elements_H-Pu","305498092_Plating_a_Dendrite-Free_Lithium_Anode_with_a_PolymerCeramicPolymer_Sandwich_Electrolyte","305418229_High_Capacity_of_Hard_Carbon_Anode_in_Na-Ion_Batteries_Unlocked_by_POx_Doping","304068363_Hard_Carbon_Microtubes_Made_from_Renewable_Cotton_as_High-Performance_Anode_Material_for_Sodium-Ion_Batteries","299500764_Mesoporous_soft_carbon_as_an_anode_material_for_sodium_ion_batteries_with_superior_rate_and_cycling_performance","291328710_Na-Ion_Battery_Anodes_Materials_and_Electrochemistry","283305453_Potassium_Ion_Batteries_with_Graphitic_Materials","281859899_Projector_augmented-wave_method","281516296_Carbon_Electrodes_for_K-Ion_Batteries","281451480_Ab_initio_molecular_dynamics_for_liquid_metals","279051001_On_Special_Points_for_Brillouin_Zone_Integrations","272029512_ChemInform_Abstract_The_Emerging_Chemistry_of_Sodium_Ion_Batteries_for_Electrochemical_Energy_Storage","271226741_Recent_Development_on_Anodes_for_Na-Ion_Batteries","269808995_Lithium_ion_rechargeable_battery","259514997_Hierarchical_porous_carbon_derived_from_sulfonated_pitch_for_electrical_double_layer_capacitors","258313309_Carbon_Nanosheet_Frameworks_Derived_from_Peat_Moss_as_High_Performance_Sodium_Ion_Battery_Anodes","257979630_Sodium-Ion_Batteries","257979085_Electrode_Materials_for_Rechargeable_Sodium-Ion_Batteries_Potential_Alternatives_to_Current_Lithium-Ion_Batteries","257580302_Carbon_coated_Na3V2PO43_as_novel_electrode_material_for_sodium_ion_batteries","257226469_Advanced_carbon_anode_materials_for_lithium_ion_cells","257226395_First-principles_study_of_alkali_metal-graphite_intercalation_compounds","256420619_Electrochemical_intercalation_of_sodium_in_graphite","254998930_Local_Atomic_Density_of_Microporous_Carbons","253066910_Crystallite_Growth_in_Graphitizing_and_Non-Graphitizing_Carbons","244683079_Formation_of_Lithium-Graphite_Intercalation_Compounds_in_Nonaqueous_Electrolytes_and_Their_Application_as_a_Negative_Electrode_for_a_Lithium_Ion_Shuttlecock_Cell","238141254_High_Capacity_Anode_Materials_for_Rechargeable_Sodium-Ion_Batteries","236409751_Lamellar_Compound_of_Sodium_with_Graphite","235623990_Room-temperature_sodium-ion_batteries_Improving_the_rate_capability_of_carbon_anode_materials_by_templating_strategies","234845961_Studies_of_Lithium_Intercalation_into_Carbons_Using_Nonaqueous_Electrochemical_Cells","230630016_Projector_Agmented-Wave_Method","229537026_Electrochemical_Na_Insertion_and_Solid_Electrolyte_Interphase_for_Hard-Carbon_Electrodes_and_Application_to_Na-Ion_Batteries","225188515_Charge-Discharge_Characteristics_of_the_Mesocarbon_Miocrobeads_Heat-Treated_at_Different_Temperatures","222799087_Chemistry_of_synthesis_structure_preparation_and_application_of_aromatic-derived_mesophase_pitch","50269050_Effect_of_the_Damping_Function_in_Dispersion_Corrected_Density_Functional_Theory","13283961_Ab_Initio_Molecular_Dynamics_for_Liquid_Metals","13277976_Ab-Initio_Molecular-Dynamics_Simulation_of_The_Liquid-Metal_Amorphous-Semiconductor_Transition_In_Germanium","13228890_Generalized_Gradient_Approximation_Made_Simple"]}
