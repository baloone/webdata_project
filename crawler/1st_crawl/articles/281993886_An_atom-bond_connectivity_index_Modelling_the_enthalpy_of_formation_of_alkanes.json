{"id":"281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","abstract":"The atom-bond connectivity index (ABC), a novel graph theoretical invariant, based on the connectivity between atoms and bonds in a molecule, is proposed. This structure-descriptor is computed from the vertex and edge degrees, but in contrast to the original connectivity index of Randic - ABC does not reflect the extent of branching of the molecule. ABC is used to describe the heats of formation of alkanes, resulting in a good quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model (r = 0.9970). The model is interpreted in such a manner that the intercept and slope of the regression equation have a physical meaning.","authors":["E. Estrada","L. Torres","L.
