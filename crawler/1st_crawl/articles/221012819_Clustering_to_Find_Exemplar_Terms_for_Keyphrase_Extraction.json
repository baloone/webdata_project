{"id":"221012819_Clustering_to_Find_Exemplar_Terms_for_Keyphrase_Extraction","abstract":"Keyphrases are widely used as a brief summary of documents. Since man- ual assignment is time-consuming, vari- ous unsupervised ranking methods based on importance scores are proposed for keyphrase extraction. In practice, the keyphrases of a document should not only be statistically important in the docu- ment, but also have a good coverage of the document. Based on this observa- tion, we propose an unsupervised method for keyphrase extraction. Firstly, the method finds exemplar terms by leverag- ing clustering techniques, which guaran- tees the document to be semantically cov- ered by these exemplar terms. Then the keyphrases are extracted from the doc- ument using the exemplar terms. Our method outperforms sate-of-the-art graph- based ranking methods (TextRank) by 9.5% in F1-measure.","authors":["Zhiyuan Liu","Peng Li","Yabin Zheng","Maosong Sun"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.3115/1699510.1699544","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2009, 6-7 August 2009, Singapore, A meeting of SIGDAT, a Special Interest Group of the ACL"],"references":["234801929_Graph-based_keyword_extraction_for_single-document_summarization","221303588_Reducing_false_positives_by_expert_combination_in_automatic_keyword_indexing","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","262562891_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques_2nd_Edition","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","222827140_KP-Miner_A_keyphrase_extraction_system_for_English_and_Arabic_documents","221615331_A_practical_system_of_keyphrase_extraction_for_web_pages","221608231_Generating_summary_keywords_for_emails_using_topics","221102588_CollabRank_Towards_a_Collaborative_Approach_to_Single-Document_Keyphrase_Extraction","220812745_Automatic_Hypertext_Keyphrase_Detection"]}
