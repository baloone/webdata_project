{"id":"303445887_Energy_Exchange_Analysis_in_Droplet_Dynamics_via_the_Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard_Model","abstract":"We develop the energy budget equation of the coupled\nNavier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system. We use the NSCH equations to model\nthe dynamics of liquid droplets in a liquid continuum. Buoyancy effects are\naccounted for through the Boussinesq assumption. We physically interpret each\nquantity involved in the energy exchange to further insight into the model.\nHighly resolved simulations involving density-driven flows and merging of\ndroplets allow us to analyze these energy budgets. In particular, we focus on\nthe energy exchanges when droplets merge, and describe flow features relevant\nto this phenomenon. By comparing our numerical simulations to analytical\npredictions and experimental results available in the literature, we conclude\nthat modeling droplet dynamics within the framework of NSCH equations is a\nsensible approach worth further research.","authors":["Luis Espath","Adel Sarmiento","Philippe Vignal","B.
