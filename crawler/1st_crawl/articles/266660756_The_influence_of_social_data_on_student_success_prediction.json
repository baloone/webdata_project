{"id":"266660756_The_influence_of_social_data_on_student_success_prediction","abstract":"Learning analytics is concerned with collecting, analyzing, and understanding data obtained from students. In this paper, we introduce methods based on data mining and social network analysis to predict a student success. We also focus on identification of different types of data that can be obtained from university information systems. We discuss their influence on the prediction accuracy. We confirm that data about student social behaviour improve accuracy successfully by 3% for one third of the 62 investigated courses.","authors":["Hana Bydžovská","Lubomír Popelínský"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1145/2628194.2628199"],"references":["224299912_A_comparative_analysis_of_techniques_for_predicting_academic_performance","221570432_Predicting_School_Failure_Using_Data_Mining","220017784_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","313265485_Recommendation_in_higher_education_using_data_mining_techniques","228654443_Predicting_students_drop_out_A_case_study"]}
