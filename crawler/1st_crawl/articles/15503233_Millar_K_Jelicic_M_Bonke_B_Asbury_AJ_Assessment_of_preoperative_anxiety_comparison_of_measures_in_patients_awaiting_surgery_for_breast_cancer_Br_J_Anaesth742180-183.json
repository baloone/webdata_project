Forty-four\npatients awaiting breast cancer surgery completed the state scale of the stateâ€”trait anxiety inventory (STAI), the hospital\nanxiety and depression scale (HAD) and a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Analysis restricted to correlations between the\nscales gave the misleading impression that VAS scores were inconsistent with those of the HAD and STAI. However, when scores\nwere considered in relation to normative cut-off values to categorize anxiety levels, the three scales showed good agreement.\nWe conclude that the scales were equivalent in their assessment of anxiety before surgery, but that reference to normative\ndata was important in establishing such equivalence and in determining the patient's state.","authors":["Keith Millar","M Jelicic","Benno Bonke","AJ Asbury"],"meta":["March 1995BJA British Journal of Anaesthesia 74(2):180-3","DOI:10.1093/bja/74.2.180","SourcePubMed"],"references":["235361542_Manual_for_the_State-Trait_Anxiety_Inventory_Form_Y1_-_Y2","242474911_Bias_in_Quantifying_Judgment","237090407_Mannual_for_the_State-Trait_anxiety_inventory_STAI_Form","227674999_The_Hospital_Anxiety_And_Depression_Scale","22658765_Biases_in_judging_sensory_magnitude","22475252_Sensitivity_and_Accuracy_of_the_Visual_Analogue_Scale_A_Psycho-Physical_Classroom_Experiment","22279921_Patients_with_protracted_pain_A_survey_conducted_at_The_London_Hospital","20076451_The_Hospital_Anxiety_And_Depression_Scale","16832488_Clinical_trial_design_the_neglected_problem_of_asymmetrical_transfer_in_cross-over_trials","16106159_Measurement_in_clinical_trials"]}
