{"id":"319417838_MODERATING_ROLE_OF_RESILIENCE_AND_SELF_EFFICACY_ON_THE_STRESS_AND_PERFORMANCE_RELATIONSHIP_AMONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS","abstract":"Universities are strategic assets of a country. Recently universities in Pakistan have experienced changes; resultantly students are exposed to different stressors that affect their academic performance. The resources have unique position in stress-performance relationship because resources buffer the negative effects of stressors. Keeping in view vital role of resources, the current study has examined moderating role of resources (resilience and self efficacy) on the stress and performance relationship. In this regard, students of COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Attock were selected as special case. The data were online collected from 415 students. The results showed that majority of respondents were male (73%), single (92%), having intermediate level degrees (76%). Department wise Computer Science (38%); Management Science (25%); Electrical Engineering (20%) and Mathematics (16%). The multivariate analysis showed that there was a negative relationship between stressors and students' performance, whereas the resources moderated the relationship between stressors and performance. The resources were also positively related to performance. It has been concluded that the problem of student stress is recognized hazard and should be dealt in proactive way by providing sufficient resources to the students. Otherwise it can have overwhelming effects on performance of students and growth of universities as whole.","authors":["Anwar Khan","Sirajud Din","Muhammad Anwar"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1109/5.7710122","Project: Moderating Role Of Resilience And Self Efficacy On The Stress And Performance Relationship Among University Students"],"references":["274379817_Rankings_and_the_Reshaping_of_Higher_Education_The_Battle_for_World-Class_Excellence","236748851_Social_Support_Self-Esteem_and_Stress_as_Predictors_of_Adjustment_to_University_Among_First-Year_Undergraduates","232473741_Social_Support_as_a_Buffer_in_the_Relationship_between_Socioeconomic_Status_and_Academic_Performance","281077743_Sources_of_Stress_among_College_Students","277832129_RELATIONSHIP_BETWEEN_EDUCATIONAL_RESOURCES_AND_STUDENTS'_ACADEMIC_PERFORMANCE_IN_LAGOS_STATE_NIGERIA","271675527_The_Changing_Face_of_Accountability_Monitoring_and_Assessing_Institutional_Performance_in_Higher_Education","247723654_Burnout_and_Engagement_in_University_StudentsA_Cross-National_Study","247723117_The_Economic_Development_Impacts_of_Universities_on_Regions_Do_Size_and_Distance_Matter","242339416_The_Job_Demands-Resources_Model_State_of_the_Art","232450523_Academic_self-efficacy_and_first-year_college_student_performance_and_adjustment","227625423_Perceived_Teacher_Self-Efficacy_as_a_Predictor_of_Job_Stress_and_Burnout_Mediation_Analyses","49771962_Stressors_and_Reactions_to_Stressors_Among_University_Students","225910682_An_Examination_of_the_Relationship_Among_Academic_Stress_Coping_Motivation_and_Performance_in_College","209836113_Sources_and_Levels_of_Stress_in_Relation_to_Locus_of_Control_and_Self_Esteem_in_University_Students","51554373_Examining_the_Relationships_Between_Resilience_Mental_Health_and_Academic_Persistence_in_Undergraduate_College_Students"]}
