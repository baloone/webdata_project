{"id":"318914566_Psychological_Resources_and_Strategies_to_Cope_with_Stress_at_Work","abstract":"Introduction: the choice of strategies to cope with stress has differential effects on individual and organizational\noutcomes (e.g. well-being and performance at work). This study examined to what extent individuals differing in\ntheir positive psychological resources (optimism, hope, self-efficacy and resilience) implement different strategies\nto cope with stress in terms of change, acceptance, or withdrawal from a source of stress in an organizational\nsetting.\nMethod: A questionnaire was filled out by 554 employees from different organizations representing a wide range\nof jobs and positions.\nResults: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM; Ï‡\n2\n(7) = 27.64, p < .01, GFI = .99, NFI = .91, CFI = .93,\nRMSEA = .07)\nConclusion: the results indicated that psychological resources (optimism, hope, self-efficacy and resilience) were\npositively related to coping by change and by acceptance and negatively related to withdrawal. The theoretical\nimplications are discussed.","authors":["Edna Rabenu","Eyal Yaniv"],"meta":["August 2017International Journal of Psychological Research 10(2):8","DOI:10.21500/20112084.2698"],"references":["312398605_Associations_of_Occupational_Stressors_Perceived_Organizational_Support_and_Psychological_Capital_with_Work_Engagement_among_Chinese_Female_Nurses","312317318_The_Effect_of_Human_Resource_Management_Practices_on_Employees'_Work_Engagement_and_the_Mediating_and_Moderating_Role_of_Positive_Psychological_Capital","305515829_The_Relationship_between_Psychological_Capital_Coping_with_Stress_Well-Being_and_Performance","313534924_Stress_and_emotion_A_new_synthesis","312960414_Psychological_Capital_An_Evidence-Based_Positive_Approach","289437362_The_Oxford_handbook_of_stress_health_and_coping","286642502_Coping_with_Work_Stress_A_Review_and_Critique","284502980_Personal_coping_Theory_research_and_application","280868481_Psychological_Capital_and_Well-being","276952047_A_Longitudinal_Investigation_of_Coping_Processes_During_a_Merger_Implications_for_Job_Satisfaction_and_Organizational_Identification"]}
