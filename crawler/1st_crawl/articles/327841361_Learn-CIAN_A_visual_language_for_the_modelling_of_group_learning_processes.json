{"id":"327841361_Learn-CIAN_A_visual_language_for_the_modelling_of_group_learning_processes","abstract":"The incorporation of advanced information and communication technologies into the field of education has made the design and deployment of courses and instructional units more and more complicated. In order to support such complex task, methods and techniques have been proposed in the last years for the standardization, formalization and modelling of learning scenarios. Thus, several Visual Instructional Design Languages (VIDL) have been developed, with few of them giving an adequate and complete support for group learning processes. In this paper, we outline a domain‐specific language (DSL) for the modelling of collaborative learning scenarios. This DSL is called Learn‐CIAN. This notation has been validated by a sample of the students of Computer Science and Education degrees such that we could obtain a first view about the understandability and acceptance of this language from potential final users.","authors":["Ana Isabel Molina Díaz","Yoel Arroyo","Carmen Lacave","Miguel A.
