{"id":"329658885_Integration_of_the_Cyber_Domain_at_the_United_States_Military_Academy","abstract":"The addition of cyber as a military domain, joining the other domains of land, sea, air, and space, necessitated an ongoing review of the inclusion of cyber in the 47 month officer development experience at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY. We describe some of the most significant Academy initiatives resulting from this review, providing a case study for officer development that integrates the Cyber Domain. Inside the classroom, cyber is incorporated into general education courses, elective courses in multiple disciplines, senior capstone projects, independent study courses, multi-course sequences, a cyber minor, and several cyber-related majors. The Cyber Domain is also explored during summer military training and elsewhere outside the classroom through participation in cyber clubs, cyber-related conferences and training, summer internships across the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. private sector, and through short temporary assignments to U.S. Army cyber units. Cadets have the opportunity to formally synchronize these activities as part of the U.S. Armyâ€™s Cyber Leader Development Program, including a formal mentorship program and an Army Skill Identifier.","authors":["Andrew Oscar Hall","Edward Sobiesk"],"meta":["November 2017","Conference: Workshops: Realigning Cybersecurity Education"],"references":["254461504_Anatomy_dissection_and_mechanics_of_an_introductory_cyber-security_course's_curriculum_at_the_United_States_naval_academy","319637336_A_Capstone_Design_Project_for_Teaching_Cybersecurity_to_Non-technical_Users","220706978_The_information_technology_minor_filling_a_need_in_the_workforce_of_today"]}
