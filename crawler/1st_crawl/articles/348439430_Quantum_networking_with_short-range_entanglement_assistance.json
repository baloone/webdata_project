{"id":"348439430_Quantum_networking_with_short-range_entanglement_assistance","abstract":"We propose an approach to distribute high-fidelity long-range entanglement in a quantum network assisted by the entanglement supplied by auxiliary short-range paths between the network nodes. Entanglement assistance in the form of shared catalyst states is utilized to maximize the efficiency of entanglement concentration transformations over the edges of the network. The catalyst states are recycled for use in adaptive operations at the network nodes and replenished periodically using the auxiliary short-range paths. The rate of long-range entanglement distribution using such entanglement assistance is found to be significantly higher than possible without using entanglement assistance.","authors":["Siddhartha Santra","Vladimir Malinovsky"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.103.012407"],"references":["342186292_Entanglement-based_secure_quantum_cryptography_over_1120_kilometres","340612682_A_quantum_network_node_with_crossed_optical_fibre_cavities","335194784_Optical_Interferometry_with_Quantum_Networks","328770360_Tuning_quantum_channels_to_maximize_polarization_entanglement_for_telecom_photon_pairs","328376157_Quantum_internet_A_vision_for_the_road_ahead","310329026_Event-Ready_Bell_Test_Using_Entangled_Atoms_Simultaneously_Closing_Detection_and_Locality_Loopholes","287686799_Entanglement_Swapping_of_Two_Arbitrarily_Degraded_Entangled_States","258083246_A_quantum_network_of_clocks","47277409_Rate_analysis_for_a_hybrid_quantum_repeater","2204055_Entanglement-Assisted_Local_Manipulation_of_Pure_Quantum_States","335768169_Compensation_of_polarization-dependent_loss_using_noiseless_amplification_and_attenuation","335200697_Quantum_Teleportation_in_High_Dimensions","309757692_Two-dimensional_quantum_repeaters","276384557_Inside_Quantum_Repeaters","232753820_Experimental_entanglement_distillation_and_'hidden'_non-locality","220589688_Capacities_of_Quantum_Channels_and_How_to_Find_Them","13385798_Quantum_states_with_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_correlations_admitting_a_hidden-variable_model","12332436_Catlysis_of_Entanglement_Manipulation_for_Mixed_States","10747142_Experimental_entanglement_purification_of_arbitrary_unknown_states","2203719_Entanglement_of_Pure_States_for_a_Single_Copy","2203481_Conditions_for_a_Class_of_Entanglement_Transformations"]}
