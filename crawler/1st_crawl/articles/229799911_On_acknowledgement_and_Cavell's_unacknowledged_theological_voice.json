{"id":"229799911_On_acknowledgement_and_Cavell's_unacknowledged_theological_voice","abstract":"This article argues that Cavell's key concept of acknowledgement is of great theological significance. Acknowledgement is meant as a particular interpretation of knowledge, which emphasises the personal responsiveness and responsibility to the human other and to the world. As Cavell himself indicates, acknowledgement also overlaps with faith. However, what such acknowledgement of God amounts to, is not yet satisfactorily understood in the growing literature on Cavell. This article argues that Cavell's treatment of confessions (Augustine, Wittgenstein) and acceptance of promise (Luther) provides important clues to a more elaborate understanding of acknowledgement in general, and of acknowledging God in particular.","authors":["Espen Dahl"],"meta":["August 2010The Heythrop Journal 51(6):931 - 945","DOI:10.1111/j.1468-2265.2010.00599.x"],"references":["229532272_Acknowledging_a_hidden_God_A_theological_critique_of_Stanley_Cavell_on_scepticism"]}
