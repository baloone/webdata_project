{"id":"321291848_Computational_Intelligence_for_Medical_Imaging_Simulations","abstract":"This paper describes how to simulate medical imaging by computational intelligence to explore areas that cannot be easily achieved by traditional ways, including genes and proteins simulations related to cancer development and immunity. This paper has presented simulations and virtual inspections of BIRC3, BIRC6, CCL4, KLKB1 and CYP2A6 with their outputs and explanations, as well as brain segment intensity due to dancing. Our proposed MapReduce framework with the fusion algorithm can simulate medical imaging. The concept is very similar to the digital surface theories to simulate how biological units can get together to form bigger units, until the formation of the entire unit of biological subject. The M-Fusion and M-Update function by the fusion algorithm can achieve a good performance evaluation which can process and visualize up to 40 GB of data within 600 s. We conclude that computational intelligence can provide effective and efficient healthcare research offered by simulations and visualization.","authors":["Victor Chang"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Medical Systems 42(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10916-017-0861-x"],"references":["317306202_SYNTHETIC_MINORITY_OVERSAMPLING_TECHNIQUE_AND_FRACTAL_DIMENSION_FOR_IDENTIFYING_MULTIPLE_SCLEROSIS","315729777_Detection_of_unilateral_hearing_loss_by_Stationary_Wavelet_Entropy","309492064_Detection_of_Unilateral_Hearing_Loss_by_Stationary_Wavelet_Entropy","289571547_Pathological_brain_detection_in_MRI_scanning_via_Hu_moment_invariants_and_machine_learning","273391970_Personal_Visualization_and_Personal_Visual_Analytics","315541580_Towards_data_analysis_for_Weather_Cloud_Computing","310842198_Virtual_anthropology","308082784_CHAPTER_3_Metrics","274165222_Digital_geometry","268689768_Virtual_Anthropology","262875969_Neuro_The_New_Brain_Sciences_and_the_Management_of_the_Mind","234161875_WHO_Strategy_for_Collecting_Safety_Data_in_Public_Health_Programmes_Complementing_Spontaneous_Reporting_Systems","225960696_Some_Topological_Properties_of_Surfaces_in_Z3","224377730_Three-Dimensional_Digital_Line_Segments","223068811_CYP2A6_Gene_Deletion_Reduces_Susceptibility_to_Lung_Cancer"]}
