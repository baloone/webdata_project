{"id":"313829860_Intraocular_Manifestations_of_Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_A_Review_of_the_Literature","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is most commonly associated with pulmonary infection. However, tuberculosis (TB) can also affect the eye. TB can affect nearly any tissue in the eye, and a high index of suspicion is required for accurate diagnosis, as many of the intraocular manifestations of TB can mimic other, more common diseases. Correct diagnosis is critical because systemic anti-tuberculosis treatment may be required, and vision loss or even loss of the affected eye can occur without proper treatment. Thus, it is important for ophthalmologists and infectious disease specialists to work together to accurately diagnose and treat intraocular TB. This article reports the various known presentations of intraocular TB and reviews important elements of diagnosis and treatment.","authors":["Lauren A.
