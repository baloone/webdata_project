{"id":"287637703_Physical_and_numerical_simulation_of_the_manufacturing_chain_for_the_DP_steel_strips","abstract":"Analysis of the correlation between manufacturing parameters and properties of the DP steel strips is the objective of the paper. Plas-tometrlc tests on the Gleeble 3800 simulator were performed to determine coefficients in the flow stress model and dilatometrie tests were performed for Identification of the microstructure evolution model. Physical simulations of the continuous annealing were performed on the Gleeble 3800. Various heating schedules in annealing were investigated and resulting microstructure was analysed. Results of the numerical simulation of the whole manufacturing chain for the DP steel strips, which Is composed of hot rolling, laminar cooling, cold rolling and continuous annealing, are presented in the paper.","authors":["Roman Kuziak","M.
