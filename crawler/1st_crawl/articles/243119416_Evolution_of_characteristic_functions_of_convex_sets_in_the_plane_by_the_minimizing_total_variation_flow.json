{"id":"243119416_Evolution_of_characteristic_functions_of_convex_sets_in_the_plane_by_the_minimizing_total_variation_flow","abstract":"In this paper we compute the explicit evolution of the minimizing total variation flow when the initial condition is the characteristic function of a convex set in ℝ2, or a finite number of them which are sufficiently separated. We also obtain some explicit solutions of the total variation formulation of the denoising problem in image processing. We illustrate these results with some experiments.","authors":["François Alter","Vicent Caselles","Antonin Chambolle"],"meta":["January 2005Interfaces and Free Boundaries 7(1):29-53","DOI:10.4171/IFB/112"],"references":["248039123_The_Total_Variation_Flow_in_N","231848839_An_active_set_strategy_based_on_the_augmented_Lagrangian_formulation_for_image_restoration","226544039_On_a_Crystalline_Variational_Problem_Part_IFirst_Variation_and_Global_L_Regularity","225171597_On_a_Crystalline_Variational_Problem_Part_IIBV_Regularity_and_Structure_of_Minimizers_on_Facets","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","2501535_Image_deblurring_Spectrum_Interpolation_and_Application_to_Satellite_Imaging","2281914_A_Nonlinear_Primal-Dual_Method_For_Total_Variation-Based_Image_Restoration","258891094_On_the_Equation_of_Surfaces_of_Prescribed_Mean_Curvature_Existence_and_Uniqueness_without_Boundary_Conditions","258229673_Two_theorems_in_geometric_measure_theory","255608821_ALGORITHMS_FOR_TOTAL_VARIATION_MINIMIZATION","243767687_Functions_of_Bounded_Variation_and_Free_Discontinuity_Problems","243737318_Measure_Theory_and_Fine_Properties_of_Functions","243119269_Characterization_of_facet_breaking_for_nonsmooth_mean_curvature_flow_in_the_convex_case","242570070_Convex_bodies_the_Brunn-Minkowski_theory","237127862_Random_Sets_and_Integral_Geometry","226934756_Pairings_between_measures_and_bounded_functions_and_compensated_compactness","226456870_Image_recovery_via_total_variation_minimization_and_related_problems","224010977_Real_and_Complex_Analysis","44562447_Operateurs_maximaux_monotones_et_semi-groupes_de_contractions_dans_les_espaces_de_Hilbert_par_H_Brezis"]}
