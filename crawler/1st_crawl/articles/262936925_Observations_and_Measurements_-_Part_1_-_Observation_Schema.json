{"id":"262936925_Observations_and_Measurements_-_Part_1_-_Observation_Schema","abstract":"We describe a conceptual model and encoding for observations and measurements. This is formalized as an Application Schema, but is applicable across a wide variety of application domains. An Observation is an action with a result which has a value describing some phenomenon. The observation is modelled as a Feature within the context of the General Feature Model [ISO 19101, ISO 19109]. An observation feature binds a result to a feature of interest, upon which the observation was made. The observed property is a property of the feature of interest. An observation uses a procedure to determine the value of the result, which may involve a sensor or observer, analytical procedure, simulation or other numerical process. The observation pattern and feature is primarily useful for capturing metadata associated with the estimation of feature properties, which is important particularly when error in this estimate is of interest. An observation results in an estimate of the value of a property of the feature of interest. Observation values may have many datatypes, including primitive types like category or measure, but also more complex types such as time, location and geometry. Complex results are obtained when the observed property requires multiple components for its encoding. Furthermore, if the property varies on the feature of interest, then the result is a coverage, whose domain is the feature. In a physical realisation, the result will typically be sampled on the domain, and hence represented as a discrete coverage.","authors":["Simon Jonathan David Cox"],"meta":["January 2007","Edition: 1.0Publisher: Open Geospatial ConsortiumEditor: Cox, Simon J D"],"references":[]}
