{"id":"305081924_Automatic_Grading_of_Programming_Exercises_using_Property-Based_Testing","abstract":"We present a framework for automatic grading of programming exercises using property-based testing, a form of model-based black-box testing. Models are developed to assess both the functional behaviour of programs and their algorithmic complexity. From the functional correctness model a large number of test cases are derived automatically. Executing them on the body of exercises gives rise to a (partial) ranking of programs, so that a program A is ranked higher than program B if it fails a strict subset of the test cases failed by B. The model for algorithmic complexity is used to compute worst-case complexity bounds. The framework moreover considers code structural metrics, such as McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, giving rise to a composite program grade that includes both functional, non-functional, and code structural aspects. The framework is evaluated in a course teaching algorithms and data structures using Java.","authors":["Clara Benac Earle","Lars-Ã…ke Fredlund","John Hughes"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2899443","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["300481517_Semi-Automatic_Assessment_of_Unrestrained_Java_Code","275236578_The_Risks_of_Coverage-Directed_Test_Case_Generation","228447443_Ranking_programs_using_black_box_testing","221553597_WISE_Automated_test_generation_for_worst-case_complexity","221211342_Testing_telecoms_software_with_quviq_QuickCheck","221047639_COSTA_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Cost_and_Termination_Analyzer_for_Java_Bytecode","221000247_Cost_Analysis_of_Java_Bytecode","220094582_Improving_student_performance_by_evaluating_how_well_students_test_their_own_programs","216714976_Review_of_recent_systems_for_automatic_assessment_of_programming_assignments","2449938_QuickCheck_A_Lightweight_Tool_for_Random_Testing_of_Haskell_Programs","220990002_COSTABS_a_cost_and_termination_analyzer_for_ABS","220070444_A_Complexity_Measure","4251303_Feedback-Directed_Random_Test_Generation","3189025_A_Complexity_Measure"]}
