{"id":"270271383_Towards_a_Stratified_Learning_Approach_to_Predict_Future_Citation_Counts","abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of predicting future citation\ncount of a scientific article after a given time interval\nof its publication. To this end, we gather and conduct an\nexhaustive analysis on a dataset of more than 1.5 million\nscientific papers of computer science domain. On analysis\nof the dataset, we notice that the citation count of the articles\nover the years follows a diverse set of patterns; on\ncloser inspection we identify six broad categories of citation\npatterns. This important observation motivates us to adopt\nstratified learning approach in the prediction task, whereby,\nwe propose a two-stage prediction model â€“ in the first stage,\nthe model maps a query paper into one of the six categories,\nand then in the second stage a regression module is run\nonly on the subpopulation corresponding to that category\nto predict the future citation count of the query paper. Experimental\nresults show that the categorization of this huge\ndataset during the training phase leads to a remarkable improvement\n(around 50%) in comparison to the well-known\nbaseline system.","authors":["Tanmoy Chakraborty","Suhansanu Kumar","Pawan Goyal","Niloy Ganguly"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970190","Conference: ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL)At: London, UK"],"references":["262370471_Langidpy_An_off-the-shelf_language_identification_tool","261201101_Automatic_Classification_and_Analysis_of_Interdisciplinary_Fields_in_Computer_Sciences","254464722_Will_this_hashtag_be_popular_tomorrow","232242699_What_sticks_with_whom_Twitter_follower-followee_networks_and_news_classification","227100298_Overcoming_the_Myopia_of_Inductive_Learning_Algorithms_with_RELIEFF","221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","221620373_Stratification_Learning_Detecting_Mixed_Density_and_Dimensionality_in_High_Dimensional_Point_Clouds_PREPRINT","221362500_Stratified_learning_of_local_anatomical_context_for_lung_nodules_in_CT_images","200110638_Estimating_the_Number_of_Citations_using_Author_Reputation","23709169_The_Effects_of_Aging_on_Researchers'_Publication_and_Citation_Patterns","11334017_Journal_Prestige_Publication_Bias_and_Other_Characteristics_Associated_With_Citation_of_Published_Studies_in_Peer-Reviewed_Journals","6354508_Characteristics_Associated_with_Citation_Rate_of_the_Medical_Literature","2482777_Multicategory_Support_Vector_Machines_Theory_and_Application_to_the_Classification_of_Microarray_Data_and_Satellite_Radiance_Data","308048640_Thirteen_ways_to_look_at_the_correlation_coefficient","294281587_Predicting_High_Impact_Academic_Papers_Using_Citation_Network_Features","289942031_Improved_part-of-speech_tagging_for_online_conversational_text_with_word_clusters","269200173_Computer_science_fields_as_ground-truth_communities","266658568_Predicting_bursts_and_popularity_of_hashtags_in_real-time","262202279_Discover_breaking_events_with_popular_hashtags_in_Twitter","254006037_To_better_stand_on_the_shoulder_of_giants","238382811_Determinants_of_Research_Citation_Impact_in_Nanoscience_and_Nanotechnology","230801973_Theory_of_Point_Estimation","228582842_Multicategory_Support_Vector_Machines_Preliminary_Long_Abstract","221654477_Ranking-based_clustering_of_heterogeneous_information_networks_with_star_network_schema","221615266_Who_Should_I_Cite_Learning_Literature_Search_Models_from_Citation_Behavior_ABSTRACT","221613392_Citation_count_prediction_Learning_to_estimate_future_citations_for_literature","221520130_What's_in_a_Hashtag_Content_based_Prediction_of_the_Spread_of_Ideas_in_Microblogging_Communities","221024115_Differences_in_the_Mechanics_of_Information_Diffusion_Across_Topics_Idioms_Political_Hashtags_and_Complex_Contagion_on_Twitter","221013267_Automatic_classification_of_citation_function","220817161_Whose_Idea_Was_This_and_Why_Does_it_Matter_Attributing_Scientific_Work_to_Citations","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","209436387_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Regression","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","26885651_Predicting_citation_count_of_Bioinformatics_papers_within_four_years_of_publication","11952712_Impact_factors_and_why_they_won't_go_away","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output"]}
