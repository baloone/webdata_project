{"id":"305294393_Increasing_self-efficacy_in_learning_to_program_exploring_the_benefits_of_explicit_instruction_for_problem_solving","abstract":"The difficulty of learning to program has long been identified amongst novices. This study explored the benefits of teaching a problem solving strategy by comparing students’ perceptions and attitudes towards problem solving before and after the strategy was implemented in secondary schools. Based on self-efficacy theory, students’ problem solving self-efficacy as well as teachers’ self-efficacy were investigated, showing that both students’ and teachers’ self-efficacy may have benefited from the explicit instruction. This would imply that teaching problem solving explicitly should be encouraged to increase self-efficacy to program.","authors":["Irene Govender","Desmond Govender","Marietjie Havenga","Elsa Mentz"],"meta":["July 2014The Journal for Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa 10(1):14","DOI:10.4102/td.v10i1.19","Project: Programming"],"references":["315117455_Supporting_Information_Technology_Teachers_through_Programming_Professional_Development_A_South_African_Case_Study","290139341_From_Procedural_to_Object-Oriented_Programming_OOP-_Performance_in_OOP_An_empirical_study","289647644_The_diverse_educational_needs_and_challenges_of_Information_Technology_teachers_in_two_black_rural_schools","267298630_Toward_a_Framework_of_Programming_Pedagogy","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","284677521_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_of_Adolescents","274183124_Social_Foundations_of_Thought_and_Action_A_Social-Cognitive_View","271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy","270236534_Analyzing_QualitativeCategorical_Data","261860774_Teaching_problem_solving_effectively"]}
