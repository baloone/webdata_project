{"id":"321547712_Fractal_Geometry_and_Stochastics","abstract":"Fractal geometry is a new and promising field for researchers from different disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. It is used to model complicated natural and technical phenomena. The most convincing models contain an element of randomness so that the combination of fractal geometry and stochastics arises in between these two fields. It contains contributions by outstanding mathematicians and is meant to highlight the principal directions of research in the area. The contributors were the main speakers attending the conference \"Fractal Geometry and Stochastics\" held at Finsterbergen, Germany, in June 1994. This was the first international conference ever to be held on the topic. The book is addressed to mathematicians and other scientists who are interested in the mathematical theory concerning: • Fractal sets and measures • Iterated function systems • Random fractals • Fractals and dynamical systems, and • Harmonic analysis on fractals. The reader will be introduced to the most recent results in these subjects. Researchers and graduate students alike will benefit from the clear expositions.","authors":["Christoph Bandt","Siegfried Graf","Martina Zähle"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/978-3-0348-7755-8","ISBN: 978-3-0348-7757-2"],"references":[]}
