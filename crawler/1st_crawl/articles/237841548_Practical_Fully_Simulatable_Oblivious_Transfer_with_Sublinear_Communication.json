{"id":"237841548_Practical_Fully_Simulatable_Oblivious_Transfer_with_Sublinear_Communication","abstract":"During an adaptive k-out-of-N oblivious transfer (OT), a sender has N private documents, and a receiver wants to adaptively fetch k documents from them such that the sender learns nothing about the receiverâ€™s selection and the receiver learns nothing more than those chosen documents. Many fully simulatable and universally composable adaptive OT schemes have been proposed, but those schemes typically require \\(\\mathcal{O}(N)\\) communication in the initialization phase, which yields \\(\\mathcal{O}(N)\\) overall communication. On the other hand, in some applications, the receiver just needs to fetch a small number of documents, so the initialization cost dominates in the entire protocol, especially for 1-out-of-N OT. We propose the first fully simulatable adaptive OT with sublinear communication under the DDH assumption in the plain model. Our scheme has \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})\\) communication in both the initialization phase and each transfer phase. It achieves better (amortized) overall communication complexity compared to existing schemes when \\(k=\\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})\\).","authors":["Bingsheng Zhang","Helger Lipmaa","Cong Wang","Kaili Ren"],"meta":["April 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-39884-1_8","Conference: FC 2013"],"references":["226120654_Progression-Free_Sets_and_Sublinear_Pairing-Based_Non-Interactive_Zero-Knowledge_Arguments","226120577_First_CPIR_Protocol_with_Data-Dependent_Computation","226120514_Progression-Free_Sets_and_Sublinear_Pairing-Based_Non-Interactive_Zero-Knowledge_Arguments","262399333_Universally_Composable_Commitments","261853653_Secure_two-party_computation_in_sublinear_amortized_time","250027170_Universally_Composable_Commitments_Extended_Abstract","227311719_Simulatable_Adaptive_Oblivious_Transfer","226677336_Zero-Knowledge_Undeniable_Signatures_extended_abstract","226577502_Non-Interactive_and_Information-Theoretic_Secure_Verifiable_Secret_Sharing","221499819_Protocols_for_Secure_Computations_Extended_Abstract"]}
