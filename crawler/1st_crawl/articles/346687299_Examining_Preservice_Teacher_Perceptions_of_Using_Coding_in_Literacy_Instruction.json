{"id":"346687299_Examining_Preservice_Teacher_Perceptions_of_Using_Coding_in_Literacy_Instruction","abstract":"Coding is a language with many similarities to what is traditionally thought of as literacy. Preservice teachers are familiar with literacy instruction, but were not exposed to computer science during their K-12 education nor in their teacher education course work. Yet, they are responsible for preparing children for future careers, including the growing field of computer science, which should be integrated as early as possible into the general education curriculum to build awareness, interest, and ultimately, skills. In this study, preservice teachers in a K-6 reading interventions class were trained in Scratch and provided a template to use with children struggling in various aspects of literacy. This article examines how preservice teachers perceive the relationship between coding and literacy through the theoretical framework of gaming, and whether they would include coding in literacy instruction. Results indicate preservice teachers do not feel confident enough in their teaching abilities to feel comfortable integrating coding into literacy instruction. Lack of prior knowledge and time constraints contributed to those that chose not to participate. Success occurred as Scratch was found to be motivating and individualized when using self-selected pictures and voice to connect to the written word, supporting childrenâ€™s literacy learning.","authors":["Denise K Frazier","Anastasia Trekles"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.26716/jcsi.2020.03.1.1"],"references":["319933024_Effective_Instruction_for_Persisting_Dyslexia_in_Upper_Grades_Adding_Hope_Stories_and_Computer_Coding_to_Explicit_Literacy_Instruction","343158678_Yes_Boys_Take_Ballet_Class_Too","331483929_Literacy_assessment_and_intervention_for_classroom_teachers","331179824_How_People_Learn_II_Learners_Contexts_and_Cultures","330329481_Coding_Literacy_How_Computer_Programming_Is_Changing_Writing","329649885_Technology_and_Social_Inclusion_Rethinking_the_Digital_Divide","324857157_The_introductory_computer_programming_course_is_first_and_foremost_a_LANGUAGE_course","317953571_Qualitative_inquiry_research_design_Choosing_among_five_approaches","317789613_Scratching_Beyond_the_Surface_of_Literacy_Programming_for_Early_Adolescent_Gifted_Students","312952167_Computer_Literacy_is_Literacy","305425858_Computational_Participation_Understanding_Coding_as_an_Extension_of_Literacy_Instruction","289502044_Computational_Participation","309476084_A_revision_of_bloom's_taxonomy_An_overview","285637737_Good_video_games_and_good_learning","284662570_Scratch_Multimedia_Programming_Environment_for_Young_Gifted_Learners"]}
