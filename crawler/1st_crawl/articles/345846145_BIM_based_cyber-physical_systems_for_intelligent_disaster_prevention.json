{"id":"345846145_BIM_based_cyber-physical_systems_for_intelligent_disaster_prevention","abstract":"The cyber-physical systems (CPS) has emerged in the last decade and become one of the most cutting-edge research fields. CPS is a highly integrated system of communication, computing, and control strategies. Although CPS has been studied and applied in some fields such as intelligent transportation, intelligent manufacturing, intelligent buildings, and smart cities, there is a lack of research on CPS based intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation structural system. Because structural disaster prevention and reduction have their own characteristics, it is necessary to investigate CPS based technology and system for intelligent structural disaster prevention and reduction. In this paper, a preliminary study is conducted on cyber-physical based intelligent structural disaster prevention technologies and structural systems using the Building Information Model (BIM) platform. The proposed CPS consists of the multi-source data precision sensing and intelligent control technology in the physical subsystem/layer, reliable data transmission network in the communication subsystem/layer, and real-time identification algorithm of structural state and adaptive control strategy in the information subsystem/layer. Moreover, BIM platform and Internet of things (IoT) technology are adopted for constructing the cloud architecture of CPS to achieve a high degree of integration of monitoring, identification and control, and to improve the real-time and accurate intelligent monitoring of structural disaster prevention and mitigation.","authors":["Ying Lei","Yongping Rao","Jiamin Wu","Chao-Hsiu Lin"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Industrial Information Integration 20(3):100171","DOI:10.1016/j.jii.2020.100171"],"references":["332719749_An_energy-efficient_cyber-physical_system_for_wireless_on-board_aircraft_structural_health_monitoring","325978068_An_improved_cyber-physical_systems_architecture_for_Industry_40_smart_factories","320492401_Applications_of_Cyber-Physical_System_A_Literature_Review","262056566_An_Integrated_System_for_Regional_Environmental_Monitoring_and_Management_Based_on_Internet_of_Things","333535747_A_cyber-physical_system_approach_for_building_efficiency_monitoring","330106980_Cyber-physical_approach_to_the_optimization_of_semiactive_structural_control_under_multiple_earthquake_ground_motions","328955195_Cyber-physical-system-based_safety_monitoring_for_blind_hoisting_with_the_internet_of_things_A_case_study","325378719_Structural_Performance_Monitoring_Using_a_Dynamic_Data-Driven_BIM_Environment","323500395_Big_data_for_cyber_physical_systems_in_industry_40_a_survey","321749996_A_Systematic_Review_to_Merge_Discourses_Interoperability_Integration_and_Cyber-Physical_Systems","320494860_Theoretical_Foundations_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems_A_Literature_Review","320121520_Application_of_context-aware_in_intelligent_transportation_CPS","319312411_CPS-oriented_short-term_icing_events_prediction_and_proactive_anti-ice_control_for_highway_systems","313739397_A_framework_for_interoperability_assessment_in_crisis_management","308944975_Making_Interoperability_Visible_Data_Visualization_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Development_Tool_Chains","306304441_Cyber_Physical_System_Using_Intelligent_Wireless_Sensor_Actuator_Networks_for_Disaster_Recovery","283124175_Cyber-physical_systems_integration_of_building_information_models_and_the_physical_construction","282627430_Robust_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Concept_models_and_implementation","271935573_An_emergency_resource_allocation_model_for_maritime_chemical_spill_accidents","260710703_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Snowmelt_Flood_Forecasting_in_Water_Resource_Management","254059451_Cyber-Physical_Systems_A_Perspective_at_the_Centennial"]}
