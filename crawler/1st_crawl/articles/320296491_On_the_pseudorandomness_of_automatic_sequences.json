{"id":"320296491_On_the_pseudorandomness_of_automatic_sequences","abstract":"We study the pseudorandomness of automatic sequences in terms of well-distribution and correlation measure of order 2. We detect non-random behavior which can be derived either from the functional equations satisfied by their generating functions or from their generating finite automatons, respectively.","authors":["László Mérai","Arne Winterhof"],"meta":["November 2018Cryptography and Communications 10(3)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-017-0260-7"],"references":["321374969_On_the_Nth_linear_complexity_of_automatic_sequences","314749137_Linear_Complexity_and_Expansion_Complexity_of_Some_Number_Theoretic_Sequences","285633374_Measures_of_pseudorandomness_of_finite_binary_lattices_III_Qk_correlation_normality_minimal_values","268994636_Measures_of_pseudorandomness","267104695_On_finite_pseudorandom_binary_sequences_and_their_applications_in_cryptography","265432169_Suites_algebriques_automates_et_substitutions","265432083_Ensembles_presque_periodiques_k-reconnaissables_Almost_periodic_k-recognizable_sets","256775181_On_Finite_Pseudorandom_Binary_Sequences_II_The_Champernowne_Rudin-Shapiro_and_Thue-Morse_Sequences_A_Further_Construction","251415636_Measures_of_pseudorandomness_for_finite_sequences_Typical_values","237540306_On_finite_pseudorandom_binary_sequences_I_Measure_of_pseudorandomness_the_Legendre_symbol"]}
