{"id":"220962499_Monte-Carlo_Simulation_Balancing_in_Practice","abstract":"Simulation balancing is a new technique to tune parameters of a playout\npolicy for a Monte-Carlo game-playing program. So far, this algorithm\nhad only been tested in a very artificial setting: it was limited to\n5×5 and 6×6 Go, and required a stronger external program\nthat served as a supervisor. In this paper, the effectiveness of\nsimulation balancing is demonstrated in a more realistic setting. A\nstate-of-the-art program, Erica, learned an improved playout policy on\nthe 9×9 board, without requiring any external expert to provide\nposition evaluations. The evaluations were collected by letting the\nprogram analyze positions by itself. The previous version of Erica\nlearned pattern weights with the minorization-maximization algorithm.\nThanks to simulation balancing, its playing strength was improved from a\nwinning rate of 69% to 78% against Fuego 0.4.","authors":["Shih-Chieh Huang","Rémi Coulom","Shun-Shii Lin"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-17928-0_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Computers and Games - 7th International Conference, CG 2010, Kanazawa, Japan, September 24-26, 2010, Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["238378872_Modification_of_UCT_with_Patterns_in_Monte-Carlo_Go","224056327_Monte-Carlo_Go_Reinforcement_Learning_Experiments","221112399_Bandit_Based_Monte-Carlo_Planning","220174560_Cross-Entropy_for_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","29651027_Combining_Online_and_Offline_Knowledge_in_UCT","29605418_Adding_Expert_Knowledge_and_Exploration_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","23751563_Progressive_Strategies_for_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","2922379_Monte-Carlo_Go_Developments","224182147_Fuego-An_Open-Source_Framework_for_Board_Games_and_Go_Engine_Based_on_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search","222423763_Associating_domain-dependent_knowledge_and_Monte_Carlo_approaches_within_a_Go_program","221345863_Monte-Carlo_simulation_balancing","220437221_Fuego_-_An_Open-Source_Framework_for_Board_Games_and_Go_Engine_Based_on_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search","220174436_Monte-Carlo_Go_with_Knowledge-Guided_Simulations","29648128_Efficient_Selectivity_and_Backup_Operators_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","29643593_Computing_Elo_Ratings_of_Move_Patterns_in_the_Game_of_Go","3191750_Expected-outcome_A_general_model_of_static_evaluation","2300657_Local_Gain_Adaptation_in_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent"]}
