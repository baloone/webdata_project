{"id":"252054608_Impact_of_Time_Reversal_on_multi-user_interference_in_IR-UWB","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the use of Time Reversal applied to Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) systems with multi user interference (MUI). It is known that the MUI distribution is often not Gaussian in classical IR-UWB. We show how the Time Reversal technique has an impact on the distribution of the multi-user interference (MUI) by making it even less Gaussian. So we show how performance may benefit from this MUI distribution change.","authors":["Jocelyn Fiorina","Guido Capodanno","Maria-Gabriella Di Benedetto"],"meta":["September 2011","DOI:10.1109/ICUWB.2011.6058876"],"references":["228623435_Demonstrating_time_reversal_in_ultra-wideband_communications_using_time_domain_measurements","13230360_Robust_Acoustic_Time_Reversal_with_High-Order_Multiple_Scattering","3944736_Performance_of_low-complexity_RAKE_reception_in_a_realistic_UWB_channel","255602964_Performance_of_impulse_radio_UWB_communications_based_on_time_reversal_technique","248207428_Understanding_Ultra_Wide_Band_Radio_Fundamentals","244420596_Channel_Modeling_Sub-Committee_Report_Final","243357556_Time-reversed_waves_and_super-resolution","239752113_Spatial_focusing_characteristics_of_time_reversal_UWB_pulse_transmission_with_different_antenna_arrays","230940846_Time-reversal_waves_and_super_resolution","224696039_A_Simple_IR-UWB_Receiver_Adapted_to_Multi-User_Interferences","224082532_The_non_validity_of_the_gaussian_approximation_for_multi-user_interference_in_ultra_wide_band_impulse_radio_from_an_inconvenience_to_an_advantage_-_transactions_papers","4116180_Application_of_time-reversal_with_MMSE_equalizer_to_UWB_communications","4062559_Performance_of_coherent_UWB_Rake_receivers_with_channel_estimators","4018061_RAKE_performance_for_a_pulse_based_UWB_system_in_a_realistic_UWB_indoor_channel","3950434_On_the_validity_of_Gaussian_approximation_to_characterize_the_multiuser_capacity_of_UWB_TH_PPM","3416336_Virtual_path_analysis_of_selective_RAKE_receiver_in_dense_multipath_channels","3319734_On_the_Asymptotic_Distribution_of_the_Correlation_Receiver_Output_for_Time-Hopped_UWB_Signals","3160117_Ultra-Wide_Bandwidth_Time-Hopping_Spread-Spectrum_Impulse_Radio_for_Wireless_Multiple-Access_Communications"]}
