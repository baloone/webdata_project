{"id":"227461372_Characteristics_of_effective_and_sustainable_teaching_development_programmes_for_quality_teaching_in_higher_education","abstract":"There is a growing need for teacher development centres to help instructors of higher education become better teachers. This paper describes a multi-year study designed to explore how these centres support effective and sustainable teaching development with the aim of providing a quality teaching and learning experience. Key interview findings revealed four practices that are characteristic of effective teaching centres: knowing how to be strategic; using a multilayered approach; working with existing pressures, tensions and challenges; and knowing how to get the work done. The results of this study also offer insights on how to assess the strengths and challenges of teaching centres, and suggest that leaders of these centres consider their programme outcomes carefully in order to build a centre that meets the needs of both participants and policy makers. Finally, the findings assist in framing programmes to facilitate a quality teaching and learning experience.","authors":["Heather Kanuka"],"meta":["August 2010Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management 22(2):11-11","DOI:10.1787/hemp-22-5kmbq08ncr25","SourceRePEc"],"references":["314503805_Psychometric_Properties_of_Multisource_Performance_Ratings_A_meta-Analysis_of_Subordinate_Supervisor_Peer_and_Self-Ratings","258199021_The_Concept_of_Employability","254315903_Dealing_with_Dysfunctional_Tutorial_Groups","249006351_Reconsidering_Graduate_Employability_The_'graduate_identity'_approach","242915909_Advanced_Bibliometric_Methods_as_Quantitative_Core_of_Peer_Review_Based_Evaluation_and_Foresight_Exercises","242349098_Measuring_Student_Satisfaction_at_a_UK_University","235303814_The_impact_of_facilities_on_student_choice_of_university","234732555_A_Culture_of_Evidence_An_Evidence-Centered_Approach_to_Accountability_for_Student_Learning_Outcomes","234561432_An_Exploratory_Investigation_of_the_Periodic_Performance_Evaluation_Processes_for_Marketing_Faculty_A_Comparison_of_Doctoral-Granting_and_Non-Doctoral-Granting_Universities","232494518_Estimating_Within-Group_Interrater_Reliability_With_and_Without_Response_Bias","321588053_Gender_Equality_Programmes_in_Higher_Education_International_Perspectives","317953471_Qualitative_Research_and_Case_Study_Applications_In_Education","315380876_An_Examination_of_the_Relationship_Between_Research_Attitudes_and_Behaviors_of_Business_School_Faculty","307149641_The_forms_of_capital","302467079_Gender_and_Skill","298812182_Special_issue_-_Dissonant_study_orchestration_in_higher_education_manifestation_and_effects_-_Introduction","294802387_Higher_education_for_a_changing_world","289722027_Activity_led_learning_within_aerospace_at_Coventry_University","287661968_Performance_Appraisal_in_Higher_Education_Comparing_Departments_of_Management_with_other_Business_Units","281562392_All_You_Need_to_Know_about_Action_Research","277522052_Variation_in_learning_orchestration_in_university_biology_courses","275714185_A_broad-bandwidth_public-domain_personality_inventory_measuring_the_lower-level_facets_of_several_five-factor_models_Personality_Psychology_in_Europe_7_7-28","275635319_Determining_Faculty_Effectiveness","271774011_Performance_Funding_Comes_of_Age_in_Tennessee","270200131_Knowing_and_Reasoning_in_College_Gender-Related_Patterns_in_Students'_Intellectual_Development","270192525_Gender_Matters_from_School_to_Work","264564808_Applying_Theories_of_Person-Environment_Fit_to_the_Transition_From_School_to_Work","263443442_Academic_Freedom_and_Autonomy_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Germany","263073340_Student_Perspectives_on_Critical_Incidents_in_the_Tutorial_Group","261746874_The_Role_of_Colleagues_in_the_Evaluation_of_College_Teaching","258179611_Merit_Pay_in_a_Public_Higher_Education_Institution_Questions_of_Impact_and_Attitudes","249027670_Gender_inequality_in_British_and_German_universities","248962896_A_Performance_Indicator_of_Teaching_Quality_in_Higher_Education_The_Course_Experience_Questionnaire","247833700_An_empirical_investigation_of_faculty_research_productivity_and_implications_for_practice","247169984_An_examination_of_the_peer_review_process_in_accounting_journals","245950651_Dissonance_in_Experience_of_Teaching_and_its_Relation_to_the_Quality_of_Student_Learning","245906300_Developing_A_Comprehensive_Faculty_Evaluation_System","245639566_Changing_Practices_in_Evaluating_Teaching_A_Practical_Guide_to_Improved_Faculty_Performance_and_Pro","245155235_Academic_tribes_and_territories_Intellectual_enquiry_and_the_culture_of_disciplines","243544251_Forms_of_Intellectual_and_Ethical_Development_in_the_College_Years_A_Scheme","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform","239832201_Applying_the_Social_Relations_Model_to_Self_and_Peer_Evaluation_in_Team_Settings","239064475_Cognitive_and_Ethical_Growth_The_Making_of_Meaning","238432243_What_Makes_a_Good_Scientist_Determinants_of_Peer_Evaluation_among_Biologists","238399011_Employability_skills_From_corporate_'wish_list'_to_government_policy","235285575_What_constitutes_high_quality_teaching_and_learning_and_how_to_assure_it","234683306_The_Experience_of_Performance_Funding_on_Higher_Education_at_the_Campus_Level_in_the_Past_20_Years","234666429_Reliability_of_Peer_Reviews","232590879_Peer_Evaluation_in_Self-Managing_Work_Groups","232511625_Methods_of_Peer_Assessment","232470608_Peer_and_subordinate_performance_measurement_equivalence","230785204_Teaching_for_Quality_Learning_at_University_Society_for_Research_into_Higher_Education","229985757_Peer_Appraisals_Differentiation_of_Individual_Performance_on_Group_Tasks","229796070_Academia_as_a_Profession_and_the_Hierarchy_of_the_Sexes_Paths_out_of_Research_in_German_Universities","229566257_Editorial_Addressing_the_Gender_Gap_in_Studies_of_Emotion"]}
