{"id":"316081610_Towards_an_Ontology_of_Goal-Oriented_Requirements","abstract":"Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) has grown into an important area of research in the past decades. Still, some of its corners remain dark, since different GORE languages do not provide a well-founded conceptualization of the domain and are not consensual. This may lead to ambiguous or weak understanding of GORE concepts. In this paper, we introduce the Goal-Oriented Requirements Ontology (GORO), a domain ontology founded on the Unified Foundational Ontol-ogy (UFO) that intends to represent the nature and relations of concepts surrounding the GORE domain. We use GORO to explore and clarify the semantics used, sometimes implicitly, by well-known GORE languages.","authors":["Pedro Negri","Vítor E.
