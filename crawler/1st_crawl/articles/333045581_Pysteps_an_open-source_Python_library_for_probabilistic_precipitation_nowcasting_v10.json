{"id":"333045581_Pysteps_an_open-source_Python_library_for_probabilistic_precipitation_nowcasting_v10","abstract":"Pysteps is an open-source and community-driven Python library for probabilistic precipitation nowcasting, that is, very-short-range forecasting (0–6 h). The aim of pysteps is to serve two different needs. The first is to provide a modular and well-documented framework for researchers interested in developing new methods for nowcasting and stochastic space–time simulation of precipitation. The second aim is to offer a highly configurable and easily accessible platform for practitioners ranging from weather forecasters to hydrologists. In this sense, pysteps has the potential to become an important component for integrated early warning systems for severe weather.\n\nThe pysteps library supports various input/output file formats and implements several optical flow methods as well as advanced stochastic generators to produce ensemble nowcasts. In addition, it includes tools for visualizing and post-processing the nowcasts and methods for deterministic, probabilistic and neighborhood forecast verification. The pysteps library is described and its potential is demonstrated using radar composite images from Finland, Switzerland, the United States and Australia. Finally, scientific experiments are carried out to help the reader to understand the pysteps framework and sensitivity to model parameters.","authors":["Seppo Pulkkinen","Daniele Nerini","Andrés Pérez Hortal","Carlos Velasco-Forero"],"meta":["October 2019Geoscientific Model Development 12(10):4185–4219","DOI:10.5194/gmd-12-4185-2019","Project: pySTEPS: the precipitation nowcasting initiative"],"references":["334689876_Using_a_10-Year_Radar_Archive_for_Nowcasting_Precipitation_Growth_and_Decay_A_Probabilistic_Machine_Learning_Approach","334189530_Emulating_Earth_System_Model_temperatures_from_global_mean_temperature_trajectories_to_grid-point_level_realizations_on_land","332301974_Optical_flow_models_as_an_open_benchmark_for_radar-based_precipitation_nowcasting_rainymotion_v01","330429517_A_Reduced-Space_Ensemble_Kalman_Filter_Approach_for_Flow-Dependent_Integration_of_Radar_Extrapolation_Nowcasts_and_NWP_Precipitation_Ensembles","328686994_Comparison_of_thunderstorm_characteristics_as_seen_by_SEVIRI_and_radar_regarding_lightning_and_hail_initiation","327559789_Optical_flow_models_as_an_open_benchmark_for_radar-based_precipitation_nowcasting_rainymotion_v01","326684430_NowPrecip_an_algorithm_for_localized_probabilistic_precipitation_nowcasting_in_the_complex_terrain_of_Switzerland","326419656_A_10-year_radar-based_analysis_of_orographic_precipitation_growth_and_decay_patterns_over_the_Swiss_Alpine_region","328259164_Latent_Heat_Nudging_in_the_Canadian_Regional_Deterministic_Prediction_System","327207744_The_Analysis_of_Time_Series_An_Introduction_Sixth_Edition"]}
