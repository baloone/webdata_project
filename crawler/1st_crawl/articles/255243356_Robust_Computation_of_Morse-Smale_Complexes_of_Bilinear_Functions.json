{"id":"255243356_Robust_Computation_of_Morse-Smale_Complexes_of_Bilinear_Functions","abstract":"The Morse-Smale (MS) complex has proven to be a useful tool in extracting and visualizing features from scalar-valued data. However, existing algorithms to compute the MS complex are restricted to either piecewise linear or discrete scalar fields. This paper presents a new combinatorial algorithm to compute MS complexes for two dimensional piecewise bilinear functions defined on quadrilateral meshes. We derive a new invariant of the gradient flow within a bilinear cell and use it to develop a provably correct computation which is unaffected by numerical instabilities. This includes a combinatorial algorithm to detect and classify critical points as well as a way to determine the asymptotes of cell-based saddles and their intersection with cell edges. Finally, we introduce a simple data structure to compute and store integral lines on quadrilateral meshes which by construction prevents intersections and enables us to enforce constraints on the gradient flow to preserve known invariants.","authors":["Gregory Norgard","Peer-Timo Bremer"],"meta":["July 2013Computer Aided Geometric Design 30(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.cagd.2012.03.017"],"references":["260399974_Generating_and_Exploring_a_Collection_of_Topological_Landscapes_for_Visualization_of_Scalar-Valued_Functions","225778945_Hierarchical_Morse-Smale_Complexes_for_Piecewise_Linear_2-Manifolds","221536315_Edge_maps_Representing_flow_with_bounded_error","220944004_Topology-based_Simplification_for_Feature_Extraction_from_3D_Scalar_Fields","220223309_Parallel_Computation_of_the_Topology_of_Level_Sets","220183926_Robust_on-line_computation_of_Reeb_graphs","220067070_A_modified_look-up_table_for_implicit_disambiguation_of_Marching_Cubes","202232897_Marching_Cubes_A_High_Resolution_3D_Surface_Construction_Algorithm","47861009_Saddle_Connectors_-_An_Approach_to_Visualizing_the_Topological_Skeleton_of_Complex_3D_Vector_Fields","23456230_A_Practical_Approach_to_Morse-Smale_Complex_Computation_Scalability_and_Generality","5276211_A_Topological_Hierarchy_for_Functions_on_Triangulated_Surfaces","4188131_Extracting_higher_order_critical_points_and_topological_simplification_of_3D_vector_fields","4006096_Exploring_scalar_fields_using_critical_isovalues","3509181_The_asymptotic_decider_Resolving_the_ambiguity_in_marching_cubes","3410984_Brodlie_K_Improving_the_robustness_and_accuracy_of_the_marching_cubes_algorithm_for_isosurfacing_IEEE_Trans_Viz_and_Comput_Graph_91_16-29","2933033_Morse-Smale_Complexes_for_Piecewise_Linear_3-Manifolds","2816789_Simulation_of_Simplicity_A_Technique_to_Cope_with_Degenerate_Cases_in_Geometric_Algorithms","2651412_Marching_Cubes_33_Construction_of_Topologically_Correct_Isosurfaces","2137835_Simulation_of_simplicity_A_technique_to_cope_with_degenerate_cases_in_geometric_algorithms","269996429_Topological_Methods_in_Flow_Visualization","269996344_Saddle_Connectors_-_An_Approach_to_Visualizing_the_Topological_Skeleton_of_Complex_3D_Vector_Fields","246764408_Marching_Cubes_A_High_Resolution_3d_Surface_Construction_Algorithm","244253320_Topological_considerations_in_isosurface_generation","226286574_A_Practical_Approach_to_Two-Dimensional_Scalar_Topology","44596497_Subdivision_Analysis_of_the_Trilinear_Interpolant","2523868_Computing_Contour_Trees_in_All_Dimensions"]}
