{"id":"283869055_Every_monotone_graph_property_has_a_sharp_threshold","abstract":"In their seminal work which initiated random graph theory Erdös and Rényi discovered that many graph properties have sharp thresholds as the number of vertices tends to infinity. We prove a conjecture of Linial that every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold. This follows from the following theorem. Let Vn(p) = {0, 1}n denote the Hamming space endowed with the probability measure μp defined by μp(ε1,ε2,...,εn) = pk · (1-p)n-k, where k = ε1 + ε2 + ⋯ + εn. Let A be a monotone subset of Vn. We say that A is symmetric if there is a transitive permutation group Γ on {1,2,...,n} such that A is invariant under Γ. Theorem. For every symmetric monotone A, if μp(A) > ε then μq(A) > 1-ε for q = p + c1 log(1/2ε)/log n. (c1 is an absolute constant.)","authors":["E. Friedgut","G.
