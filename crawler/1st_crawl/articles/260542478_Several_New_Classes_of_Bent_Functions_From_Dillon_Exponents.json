{"id":"260542478_Several_New_Classes_of_Bent_Functions_From_Dillon_Exponents","abstract":"Several new classes of binary and p-ary regular bent functions are obtained in this paper. The bentness of all these functions is determined by some exponential sums over finite fields, most of which have close relations with the well-known Kloosterman sums.","authors":["Nian Li","Tor Helleseth","Xiaohu Tang","Alexander Kholosha"],"meta":["March 2013IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 59(3):1818-1831","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2012.2229782"],"references":["224605758_Proofs_of_Two_Conjectures_on_Ternary_Weakly_Regular_Bent_Functions","312628047_Irreducible_binary_cyclic_codes_of_even_dimension","266993793_Finite_fields_2nd_ed","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","265325708_Irreducible_binary_cyclic_codes_of_even_dimension","260542428_A_Class_of_Binomial_Bent_Functions_Over_the_Finite_Fields_of_Odd_Characteristic","256391988_On_bent_functions","255580799_ON_BINARY_AND_TERNARY_KLOOSTERMAN_SUMS","246143876_Explicit_evaluation_of_certain_exponential_sums","226267120_Sequences_Bent_Functions_and_Jacobsthal_Sums"]}
