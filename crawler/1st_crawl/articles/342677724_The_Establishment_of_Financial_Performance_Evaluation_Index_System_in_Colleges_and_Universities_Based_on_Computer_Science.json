{"id":"342677724_The_Establishment_of_Financial_Performance_Evaluation_Index_System_in_Colleges_and_Universities_Based_on_Computer_Science","abstract":"The situation of financial performance is an important basis for evaluating the development level of colleges and universities, and the construction of financial performance evaluation index system related to it has also become the focus of peopleâ€™s research. At present, although our country has made some breakthroughs in the construction of the financial performance evaluation index system of colleges and universities, there are still deficiencies in many aspects, which seriously restricts the improvement of the comprehensive development quality of colleges and universities. Therefore, this paper analyses the problems existing in the financial performance evaluation index system of colleges and universities, and expounds the importance of computer science and technology in the construction of the financial performance evaluation index system of colleges and universities. On this basis, this paper constructs the financial performance evaluation index system of colleges and Universities Based on computer science and technology, and puts forward the analytic hierarchy process of the evaluation index integrating computer technology, which provides a solid theoretical support for the evaluation of financial performance of universities and the improvement of the level of running schools.","authors":["Yong Sun"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1574(1):012077","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1574/1/012077"],"references":["351572479_The_Application_of_Computer_Financial_Management_Technology_in_Financial_Management"]}
