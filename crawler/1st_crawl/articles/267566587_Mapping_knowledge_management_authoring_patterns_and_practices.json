{"id":"267566587_Mapping_knowledge_management_authoring_patterns_and_practices","abstract":"This paper examines the literature on knowledge management (KM) in order to identify the typical authoring patterns and the focus of the content of published research. The study explores the argument that the inter-organizational level of analysis is explored less frequently than the intra-organizational level. The article reports on KM researchers and practices based on evidence from six journals ranked in the journal citation report covering several decades of publications. Based on this review, articles can generally be seen to have two co-authors from two different universities within the same country. The study confirms that published research is mainly empirical; largely adopting the intra-organizational level of analysis, with the people element being the least explored comparing to technology and process elements. This research gap represents an opportunity for authors to contribute with studies focusing on the inter-organizational level.","authors":["Carla Curado","Mírian Oliveira","Antonio Carlos Gastaud Maçada"],"meta":["September 2011African Journal of Business Management 5(22)"],"references":["317073452_The_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Corporate_Householding_Knowledge_Processor_to_Improve_Data_Quality","313530927_Managing_knowledge_sharing_Emergent_and_engineering_approaches","313104406_The_Strategic_Potential_of_a_Firm's_Knowledge_Portfolio","313060420_Knowledge_management_implementation_frameworks_A_review","299109217_Dynamic_knowledge_patterns_to_inform_design_A_field_study_of_knowledge_stocks_and_flows_in_an_extreme_organization","289063574_Organizations_and_Learning_Process_Its_Antecedents_and_Consequences_in_Enterprise_System_Implementation","288851902_Data_is_more_than_knowledge","288844187_Content_analysis","288077749_Factors_affecting_the_adoption_of_knowledge_management_technologies_A_discriminative_approach","285712742_Knowledge_management_processes_in_international_business_alliances_A_review_of_empirical_research_1990-2003","285261331_Knowledge_transfer_mechanisms_and_the_performance_of_franchise_systems_An_empirical_study","284685726_Industrial_Districts_and_Supply_Chains_as_Vehicles_for_Managerial_and_Organizational_Learning","280321352_Knowledge_Management_Systems_Diffusion_in_Chinese_Enterprises","279867500_Assessing_Value_in_Organizational_Knowledge_Creation_Considerations_for_Knowledge_Workers","279710861_Cocreating_understanding_and_value_in_distributed_work_How_members_of_onsite_and_offshore_vendor_teams_give_make_demand_and_break_sense"]}
