{"id":"348758128_COVID-19_pandemic_response_fatigue_in_Africa_causes_consequences_and_counter-measures","abstract":"A notable decline in adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures has been observed despite the increasing number of cases following the suspension of lockdown measures. The African governments have positively responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in previous times, however presently the COVID-19 response on the African continent is in a state of fatigue. Therefore, public vigilance on COVID-19 needs to be reinvigorated through behavioral change communication via different channels of disseminating information. In addition, support systems and social protection should be established to address the COVID-19 pandemic fatigue. Also, increased funding should be made available for enhancing the COVID-19 outbreak response.","authors":["Olayinka Stephen Ilesanmi","Ayomide Esther Bello","Aanuoluwapo Adeyimika Afolabi"],"meta":["November 2020Pan African Medical Journal 37(Suppl 1):37","DOI:10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.37.37.26742"],"references":["347512064_A_scope_review_on_home-based_care_practices_for_COVID-19_What_Nigeria_can_learn_from_other_countries","344409264_Six_months_of_COVID-19_response_in_Nigeria_lessons_challenges_and_way_forward","344350116_Perception_and_practices_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_an_urban_community_in_Nigeria_a_cross-sectional_study","342412362_Ten_considerations_for_effectively_managing_the_COVID-19_transition","339543115_How_to_fight_an_infodemic"]}
