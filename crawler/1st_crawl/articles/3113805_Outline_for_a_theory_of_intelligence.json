{"id":"3113805_Outline_for_a_theory_of_intelligence","abstract":"Intelligence is defined as that which produces successful\nbehavior. Intelligence is assumed to result from natural selection. A\nmodel is proposed that integrates knowledge from research in both\nnatural and artificial systems. The model consists of a hierarchical\nsystem architecture wherein: (1) control bandwidth decreases about an\norder of magnitude at each higher level, (2) perceptual resolution of\nspatial and temporal patterns contracts about an order-of-magnitude at\neach higher level, (3) goals expand in scope and planning horizons\nexpand in space and time about an order-of-magnitude at each higher\nlevel, and (4) models of the world and memories of events expand their\nrange in space and time by about an order-of-magnitude at each higher\nlevel. At each level, functional modules perform behavior generation\n(task decomposition planning and execution), world modeling, sensory\nprocessing, and value judgment. Sensory feedback control loops are\nclosed at every level","authors":["J.S.
