{"id":"339667144_Wideband_UHF_Antenna_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection","abstract":"This paper presents a ultra-high frequency (UHF) antenna for partial discharge (PD) detection and the antenna sensor can be used near a conducting ground wire. The proposed UHF antenna has advantages of easy setup and higher-frequency detection over the high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensor. First, a variety of loop-shaped antennas are designed to compare each near field coupling capability. Then, a new UHF antenna is designed based on the loop-shaped antenna, which has the best near field coupling capability. Finally, the proposed UHF antenna is fabricated and measured. It provides a wide impedance bandwidth of 760 MHz (740â€“1500 MHz). Its simple setup configuration and wide bandwidth frequency response in the UHF band can provide a more efficient means for PD detection.","authors":["Zhen Cui","Seungyong Park","Hosung Choo","Kyung-Young Jung"],"meta":["March 2020Applied Sciences 10(5):1698","DOI:10.3390/app10051698"],"references":["334904288_A_Compact_Four-Port_Coplanar_Antenna_Based_on_an_Excitation_Switching_Reconfigurable_Mechanism_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications","330962025_Loop-Type_Ground_Radiation_Antenna_for_a_C-Shaped_Ground_Plane","330960298_Dual-Band_Circularly_Polarized_Stack-Ring_Antenna","329491073_Development_of_UHF_Sensors_for_Partial_Discharge_Detection_in_Power_Transformer","324894938_Numerical_Study_of_Estimating_the_Arrival_Time_of_UHF_Signals_for_Partial_Discharge_Localization_in_a_Power_Transformer","324891482_Design_of_Small_CRPA_Arrays_with_Circular_Microstrip_Loops_for_Electromagnetically_Coupled_Feed","304287295_Design_of_an_Archimedean_spiral_UHF_antenna_for_pulse_monitoring_application","331882950_Dual-Band_Circular_Polarized_Flexible_Implantable_Antenna_Using_Reactive_Impedance_Substrate","318689746_UHF_characteristics_of_different_types_of_PD_sources_in_power_transformers","311389126_An_UWB_printed_antenna_for_partial_discharge_UHF_detection_in_high_voltage_switchgears"]}
