{"id":"343122785_Geographical_fragmentation_of_the_global_network_of_Twitter_communications","abstract":"Understanding the geography of society represents a challenge for social and economic sciences. The recent availability of data from social media enables the observation of societies at a global scale. In this paper, we study the geographical structure of the Twitter communication network at the global scale. We find a complex structure where self-organized patches with clear cultural, historical, and administrative boundaries are manifested and first-world economies centralize information flows. These patches unveil world regions that are socially closer to each other with direct implications for processes of collective learning and identity creation.","authors":["Leila Hedayatifar","Alfredo Morales","Yaneer Bar-Yam"],"meta":["July 2020Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.) 30(7):073133","DOI:10.1063/1.5143256"],"references":["337394625_Relationship_between_ideology_and_language_in_the_Catalan_independence_context","336754910_Segregation_and_polarization_in_urban_areas","336373046_US_social_fragmentation_at_multiple_scales","335638696_Impact_of_care_provider_network_characteristics_on_patient_outcomes_Usage_of_social_network_analysis_and_a_multi-scale_community_detection","327969853_Detecting_communities_with_the_multi-scale_Louvain_method_robustness_test_on_the_metropolitan_area_of_Brussels","327559723_A_comparative_analysis_of_approaches_to_network-dismantling","327275773_Exposure_to_opposing_views_on_social_media_can_increase_political_polarization","327215718_Topology_robustness_and_structural_controllability_of_the_Brazilian_Federal_Police_criminal_intelligence_network","331758041_The_Complexity_of_Roles_as_a_Seedbed_of_Individual_Autonomy","330561460_Opinion_Behavior_Analysis_in_Social_Networks_Under_the_Influence_of_Coopetitive_Media"]}
