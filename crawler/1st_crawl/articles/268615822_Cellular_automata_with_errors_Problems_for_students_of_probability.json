{"id":"268615822_Cellular_automata_with_errors_Problems_for_students_of_probability","abstract":"This is a survey of some problems and methods in the theory of probabilistic cellular automata. It is addressed to those students who love to learn a theory by solving problems. The only prerequisite is a standard course in probability. General methods are illustrated by examples, some of which have played important roles in the development of these methods. More than a hundred exercises and problems and more than a dozen of unsolved problems are discussed. Special attention is paid to the computational aspect; several pseudo-codes are given to show how to program processes in question.","authors":["Andrei Toom"],"meta":["January 1995"],"references":[]}
