{"id":"350165109_Posturography_with_head_movements_in_the_assessment_of_balance_in_chronic_unilateral_vestibular_lesions","abstract":"The aim of our study was to validate the method of head-shake static posturography (HS-posturography) in healthy individuals and to establish the value of this novel method in the diagnostics of patients with unilateral vestibular lesion (UV). The study included 202 participants divided into two groups, one consisting of 133 patients with canal paresis CP > 19% and one of 69 healthy subjects. Participant was tested according to the standard protocol of static posturography (SP), and with head movements of 0.3 Hz (HS 40), 0.6 Hz (HS 70) in random order controlled by a metronome. HS-posturography revealed a similar repeatability and internal consistency as the standard posturography. In patients with UV, 4th condition revealed higher sensitivity (74%) and specificity (71%) in HS 40 than in the standard posturography (67%, 65% respectively) and HS 70 (54%, 70% respectively). Static posturography and HS- posturography revealed a high reliability of the testing method. The head movements added to static posturography improve the sensitivity and specificity of the method in group with vestibular impairment. The most important test for that purpose seems to be the one on unstable surface with the eyes closed, with low frequency of head movements.","authors":["Magdalena Janc","Mariola Sliwinska-Kowalska","Piotr Politanski","Mieczyslaw Kaminski"],"meta":["March 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-85745-x"],"references":["323318811_Defining_Clinical-Posturographic_and_Intra-Posturographic_Discordances_What_Do_These_Two_Concepts_Mean","304143730_Modified_head_shake_sensory_organization_test_Sensitivity_and_specificity","49674138_Balance_Performance_in_Head-Shake_Computerized_Dynamic_Posturography_Aging_Effects_and_Test-Retest_Reliability","40042334_Modified_Head_Shake_Computerized_Dynamic_Posturography","331468181_Screening_for_Vestibular_Disorders_Using_the_Modified_Clinical_Test_of_Sensory_Interaction_and_Balance_and_Tandem_Walking_With_Eyes_Closed","251235438_Standing_Balance_Tests_for_Screening_People_With_Vestibular_Impairments","51979182_Correlating_the_Head_Shake-Sensory_Organizing_Test_With_Dizziness_Handicap_Inventory_in_Compensation_After_Vestibular_Neuritis","51804564_A_Head_Shake_Sensory_Organization_Test_to_Improve_the_Sensitivity_of_the_Sensory_Organization_Test_in_the_Elderly","51618507_The_Modified_Romberg_Balance_Test_Normative_Data_in_US_Adults","51302075_Evaluation_of_Clinical_Measures_of_Equilibrium"]}
