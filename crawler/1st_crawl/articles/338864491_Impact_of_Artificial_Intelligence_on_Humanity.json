{"id":"338864491_Impact_of_Artificial_Intelligence_on_Humanity","abstract":"Thinking is a complex procedure which is important in the current decision-making world. Intelligent systems are helping humans with this thinking process to better achieve specific goals (Binnig, Baatz, Klenk & Schmidt, 2002). The help of these systems is called “artificial intelligence,” which in computer science is defined as any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. In recent years, organizations have started using artificial intelligence within their systems, which have become a viable alternative to their traditional systems (Froese & Ziemke, 2008, p. 466). Artificial intelligence technology is improving constantly, as scientists become more interested in making systems innovative. The improvement of artificial intelligence is a matter of concern to some, because artificial intelligence could take over human intelligence. However, artificial intelligence provides advantages in solving problems and reaching decisions (Chowdhury & Sadek, 2012). It provides much more permanency, has proven to be more reliable, and will minimize costs within organizations. Therefore, it addresses issues of uncertainty and speed in solving problems and reaching decisions (Chowdhury & Sadek, 2012). Because the technology of artificial intelligence must be managed by humans, it will lead to the creation of jobs (Darrel, 2015). Therefore, artificial intelligence will not completely take over human operations.","authors":["Sem Nijssen"],"meta":["May 2019","Project: Artificial Intelligence"],"references":[]}
