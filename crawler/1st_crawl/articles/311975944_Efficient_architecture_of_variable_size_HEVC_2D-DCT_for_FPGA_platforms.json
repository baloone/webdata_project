{"id":"311975944_Efficient_architecture_of_variable_size_HEVC_2D-DCT_for_FPGA_platforms","abstract":"This study presents a design of two-dimensional (2D) discrete cosine transform (DCT) hardware architecture dedicated for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) in field programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. The proposed methodology efficiently proceeds 2D-DCT computation to fit internal components and characteristics of FPGA resources. A four-stage circuit architecture is developed to implement the proposed methodology. This architecture supports variable size of DCT computation, including 4 × 4, 8 × 8, 16 × 16, and 32 × 32. The proposed architecture has been implemented in System Verilog and synthesized in various FPGA platforms. Compared with existing related works in literature, this proposed architecture demonstrates significant advantages in hardware cost and performance improvement. The proposed architecture is able to sustain 4 K@30 fps ultra high definition (UHD) TV real-time encoding applications with a reduction of 31–64% in hardware cost.","authors":["Min Chen","Yuanzhi Zhang","Chao Lu"],"meta":["December 2016AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications 73","DOI:10.1016/j.aeue.2016.12.024"],"references":["267868364_Energy_And_Area-Efficient_Hardware_Implementation_of_HEVC_Inverse_Transform_And_Dequantization","260712151_Efficient_integer_DCT_architectures_for_HEVC","256491889_Unified_forward_inverse_transform_architecture_for_HEVC","239669029_A_high_speed_FPGA_implementation_of_the_2D_DCT_for_Ultra_High_Definition_video_coding","220844216_Scalable_FPGA_Architecture_for_DCT_Computation_Using_Dynamic_Partial_Reconfiguration","312457676_Optimization_and_implementation_on_FPGA_of_the_DCTIDCT_algorithm","312457474_Stereo_mosaicking_and_3D-video_for_singleview_HDTV_aerial_sequences_using_a_low_bit_rate_ROI_coding_framework","297588785_Adaptive_early_termination_mode_decision_for_3D-HEVC_using_inter-view_and_spatio-temporal_correlations","289832592_Low-cost_and_high-throughput_hardware_design_for_the_HEVC_16x16_2-D_DCT_transform","283028725_4K_Real_Time_HEVC_Decoder_on_FPGA","277924062_Hardware_architectures_for_the_H265HEVC_discrete_cosine_transform","273137408_FPGA_implementation_of_a_full_HD_real-time_HEVC_main_profile_decoder","272398109_A_low_energy_HEVC_inverse_transform_hardware","268750408_Mathematical_modeling_of_coding_gain_and_rate-distortion_function_in_multihypothesis_motion_compensation_for_video_signals","262206036_Low_Complexity_Video_Encoding_and_High_Complexity_Decoding_for_UAV_Reconnaissance_and_Surveillance","261230526_Fully_pipelined_DCTIDCTHadamard_unified_transform_architecture_for_HEVC_Codec","260665632_HEVC_Complexity_and_Implementation_Analysis","256491893_Core_Transform_Design_for_the_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding_HEVC_Standard","254032367_Performance_Analysis_of_Inter-Layer_Prediction_for_H264SVC","242473075_Discrete_cosine_transform_Algorithms_advantages_applications","228520416_Low-complexity_video_encoding_for_UAV_reconnaissance_and_surveillance","224641660_Optimization_and_Implementation_on_Fpga_of_the_DCTIDCT_Algorithm","220844331_Energy-Efficient_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_on_FPGAs","3878178_Implementation_of_two_dimensional_forward_DCT_and_inverse_DCT_using_FPGA"]}
