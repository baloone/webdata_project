{"id":"280229541_Non-stationary_texture_synthesis_from_random_field_modeling","abstract":"This paper presents a generalized non-stationary and fractional model for texture synthesis. The model is based on convolution and modulation operations of fractional Brownian fields and its associated spectral representation contains many poles with unit norm. Synthesized textures generated from this model can exhibit several non-trivial fringes which can be visualized in natural textures such those involved in high resolution transmission electron microscopy.","authors":["A.M.
