{"id":"357092010_Teknologiforstaelse_-_En_sammenhaengende_faglighed","abstract":"Based on 110 prototypes from an experiment on developing a new subject: Technology Comprehension in Public School, this article examines the consistency of the subject and identifies continuities and discontinuities between four competence areas in the subject as independent and as integrated into existing school subjects. The study is based on systematic analysis using didactic categories. Three main finding are presented: 1) that it is difficult to create a new professionalism in existing subjects, strong enough to develop a professional language and an integrated subject didactics. 2) The prototypes have made ground for continuity between the four competence areas, but the selection of content leading to Bildung has not yet been developed. 3) The new subject cannot be characterized by a STEM approach, but more as a multidisciplinary subject, with natural science, social science and humanities intertwined, though with more disciplinary approaches to especially the computer sciences.","authors":["Marie Falkesgaard Slot","Roland Hachmann","Malte von Sehested"],"meta":["December 2021Learning Tech","DOI:10.7146/lt.v6i10.125600"],"references":["318398877_Designtaenkning_som_didaktisk_metode_Laeringsdesign_for_teknologisk_forestillingskraft_og_handlekraft","285781831_Teaching_children_digital_literacy_through_design-based_learning_with_digital_toolkits_in_schools","284103213_Design_thinking_for_digital_fabrication_in_education","283979975_Designing_digital_fabrication_learning_environments_for_Bildung_Implications_from_ten_years_of_physical_computing_workshops","274309848_Computational_Thinking","273337040_Work-Oriented_Design_of_Computer_Artifacts","318494427_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_And_Powerful_Ideas","303883356_Towards_a_formal_assessment_of_design_literacy_Analyzing_K-12_students'_stance_towards_inquiry","289694256_Digital_fabrication_in_education_Expanding_the_research_towards_design_and_reflective_practices","246354966_Handbook_of_Applied_Multivariate_Statistics_and_Mathematical_Modeling"]}
