{"id":"268413146_Genome_Rearrangement_Problems","abstract":"Various global rearrangements of permutations, such as reversals and transpositions, have recently become of interest because of their applications in computational molec-ular biology. A reversal is an operation that reverses the order of a substring of a permutation. A transposition is an operation that swaps two adjacent substrings of a permutation. The problem of determining the smallest number of reversals required to transform a given permutation into the identity permutation is called sorting by reversals. Similar problems can be defined for transpositions and other global rear-rangements. Related to sorting by reversals is the problem of establishing the reversal diameter. The reversal diameter of S n (the symmetric group on n elements) is the maximum number of reversals required to sort a permutation of length n. Of course, diameter problems can be posed for other global rearrangements. These various problems are of interest because the permutations can be used to represent sequences of genes in chromosomes, and the global rearrangements then rep-resent evolutionary events. As a result, we call these problems genome rearrangement problems. Genome rearrangement problems seem to be unlike previously studied algorith-mic problems on sequences, so new methods have had to be developed to deal with them. These methods predominantly employ graphs to model permutation structure. However, even using these methods, often a genome rearrangement problem has no ob-vious polynomial-time algorithm, and in some cases can be shown to be NP-hard. For example, the problem of sorting by reversals is NP-hard, whereas the computational complexity of sorting by transpositions is open. For problems like these, it is natu-ral to seek polynomial-time approximation algorithms that achieve an approximation guarantee. In this thesis, we study several genome rearrangement problems as interesting and challenging algorithmic problems in their own right, including some problems for which the global rearrangement has no immediate biological equivalent. For example, we define a block-interchange to be a rearrangement that swaps any two substrings of the permutation. We examine, in particular, how the graph theoretic models relate to the genome rearrangement problems that we study. The major new results contained in this thesis are as follows: â€¢ We present a 3/2-approximation algorithm for sorting by reversals. This is the best known approximation algorithm for the problem, and improves upon the 7/4 approximation bound of the previous best algorithm.","authors":["David Alan Christie"],"meta":[],"references":["226954865_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Sorting_by_Reversals_with_Application_to_Genome_Rearrangement","221530283_Faster_and_simpler_algorithm_for_sorting_signed_permutations_by_reversals","221314052_Efficient_Bounds_for_Oriented_Chromosome_Inversion_Distance","221314044_Original_Synteny","221313866_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Inversion_Distance_Between_Two_Chromosomes","220780500_To_Cut_or_Not_to_Cut_Applications_of_Comparative_Physical_Maps_in_Molecular_Evolution","322906392_Cubelike_Puzzles-What_are_they_and_how_do_you_Solve_them","314305330_Computer_Recreations","312656699_Efficient_bounds_for_oriented_chromosome_inversion_distance","289930657_Polynomial-time_algorithm_for_computing_translocation_distance_between_genomes","266001167_Cubelike_puzzles_-_what_are_they_and_how_do_you_solve_themPH","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","247931711_The_minimum-length_generator_sequence_is_NP-hard","242626396_The_Chromosome_Inversion_Problem","242284670_Sorting_by_Bounded_Permutations","239063800_Formulations_and_complexity_of_multiple_sorting_by_reversals","238708318_Exact_and_approximation_algorithms_for_the_inversion_distance_between_two_permutations","238707382_Shuffling_Cards_and_Stopping_Times","238321161_Some_Experiments_on_the_Sorting_by_Reversals_Method","236628854_Computational_Complexity","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","225817139_Sorting_by_Short_Block-Moves","225140813_Riffle_shuffles_cycles_and_descents","223925415_On_the_problem_of_sorting_burnt_pancakes","223849799_Sorting_with_fixed-length_reversals","223287670_A_2-approximation_algorithm_for_genome_rearrangements_by_reversals_and_transpositions","222507355_Hannenhalli_S_Polynomial-time_algorithm_for_computing_translocation_distance_between_genomes_Discrete_Appl_Math_711-3_137-151","222437944_Bounds_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversal","222197449_Sorting_permutations_by_block-interchanges","221591808_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Extended_String-to-String_Correction_Problem","221530668_Sorting_by_reversals_is_difficult","220780495_A_32-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Sorting_by_Reversals","220779746_Sorting_Permutations_by_Transpositions","220618108_Genome_Rearrangements_and_Sorting_by_Reversals","220617353_Complexity_Results_for_Multiprocessor_Scheduling_Under_Resource_Constraints","220570738_Sorting_by_Bounded_Block-moves","220532638_Sorting_by_Transpositions","220431597_An_Extension_of_the_String-to-String_Correction_Problem","220431230_The_String-to-String_Correction_Problem","220406736_Reversing_Trains_A_Turn_of_the_Century_Sorting_Problem","220406421_On_the_Diameter_of_the_Pancake_Network","220406336_The_Minimum-Length_Generator_Sequence_Problem_is_NP-Hard","220154529_The_Complexity_of_Finding_Minimum-Length_Generator_Sequences","220112678_A_Tight_Lower_Bound_for_the_Train_Reversal_Problem","220076272_Sorting_by_insertion_of_leading_elements","49267978_Introduction_to_Computational_Molecular_Biology","31272208_Sorting_by_Reversals_Genome_Rearrangements_in_Plant_Organelles_and_Evolutionary_History_of_X_Chromosome","14614980_Genome_Sequence_Comparison_and_Scenarios_for_Gene_Rearrangements_A_Test_Case","14545528_Parametric_genome_rearrangement","4354601_Polynomial-time_algorithms_for_permutation_groups","2729858_Transforming_Men_Into_Mice_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Genomic_Distance_Problem","3635319_Transforming_Men_into_Mice_polynomial_algorithm_for_genetic_distance_problem","3596357_Open_combinatorial_problems_in_computational_molecular_biology","3593588_Genome_Rearrangements_and_Sorting_by_Reversals","2826736_Sorting_Permutations_by_Reversals_and_Eulerian_Cycle_Decompositions"]}
