{"id":"285270985_Named_entity_recognition_with_bidirectional_LSTM-SNNs","abstract":"Named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally\nrequired large amounts of knowledge in the form of feature engineering and\nlexicons to achieve high performance. In this paper, we present a novel neural\nnetwork architecture that automatically detects word- and character-level\nfeatures using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating\nthe need for most feature engineering. We also propose a novel method of\nencoding partial lexicon matches in neural networks and compare it to existing\nexact match approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given only tokenized\ntext, publicly available word vectors, and an automatically constructed lexicon\nfrom open sources, our system is able to surpass the reported state-of-the-art\non the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.35 F1 points and achieves competitive results\non the CoNLL 2003 dataset, rivaling systems that employ heavy feature\nengineering, proprietary lexicons, and rich entity linking information.","authors":["Jason P.
