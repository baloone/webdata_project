{"id":"330291953_Certain_fuzzy_graph_structures","abstract":"A fuzzy graph structure is an extension of a fuzzy graph. In this research paper, we present certain notions, including semi strong min-product of fuzzy graph structures, regular fuzzy graph structures, strong and complete fuzzy graph structures. Moreover, we discuss degree and total degree of a vertex in semi strong min-product of fuzzy graph structures and investigate some of their properties. Furthermore, we present an application of fuzzy graph structures in decision-making, that is, identification of best traveling service. In last, we develop an algorithm explaining general procedure of our application.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Muzzamal Sitara"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing 61(1â€“2)","DOI:10.1007/s12190-019-01237-2"],"references":["327962421_Novel_decision-making_method_based_on_bipolar_neutrosophic_information","325879331_Novel_decision-making_algorithms_based_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_rough_environment","307528867_On_m-polar_fuzzy_graph_structures","305987917_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_graphs_with_applications","294139615_Application_of_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Sets_in_Graph_Structures","267127400_On_generalised_fuzzy_graph_structures","266074781_Generalized_graph_structures","317934683_A_new_decision-making_method_based_on_bipolar_neutrosophic_directed_hypergraphs","317429684_FUZZY_GRAPH_STRUCTURE_OF_FLOWER_GRAPHS","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs"]}
