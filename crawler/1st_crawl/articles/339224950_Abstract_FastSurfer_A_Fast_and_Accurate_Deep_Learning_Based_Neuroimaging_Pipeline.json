{"id":"339224950_Abstract_FastSurfer_A_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Learning_Based_Neuroimaging_Pipeline","abstract":"Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines involve computationally intensive, time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not scale well to large cohort studies. With FastSurfer [1] we propose a fast deep-learning based alternative for the automated processing of structural human MRI brain scans, including surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. FastSurfer consists of an advanced deep learning architecture (FastSurferCNN) used to segment a whole brain MRI into 95 classes in under 1 min, and a surface pipeline building upon this high-quality brain segmentation.","authors":["Leonie Henschel","Sailesh Conjeti","Santiago Estrada","Kersten Diers"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-29267-6_46","In book: Bildverarbeitung f√ºr die Medizin 2020 (pp.208-208)"],"references":["342016182_FastSurfer_-_A_fast_and_accurate_deep_learning_based_neuroimaging_pipeline"]}
