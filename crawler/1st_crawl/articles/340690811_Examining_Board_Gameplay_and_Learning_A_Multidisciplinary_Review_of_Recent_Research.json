{"id":"340690811_Examining_Board_Gameplay_and_Learning_A_Multidisciplinary_Review_of_Recent_Research","abstract":"Background. Recent years have seen the resurgence of board games designed for entertainment, and to teach or explicate real life problems. The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games.\nAim. This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners.\nResults. Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity.\nConclusion. The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games.","authors":["Rebecca Yvonne Bayeck"],"meta":["April 2020Simulation & Gaming 51(4):104687811990128","DOI:10.1177/1046878119901286"],"references":["340677016_Games_as_Activity_Correcting_the_Digital_Fallacy","331570382_Playing_board_games_with_mathematical_self-concept_to_support_early_numeracy_skill_of_5-6_years_old_children","331525356_Development_of_an_Issue-Situation-Based_Board_Game_A_Systemic_Learning_Environment_for_Water_Resource_Adaptation_Education","331208620_Special_series_on_effects_of_board_games_on_health_education_and_promotion_board_games_as_a_promising_tool_for_health_promotion_a_review_of_recent_literature","330758298_RETAIN_A_Board_Game_That_Improves_Neonatal_Resuscitation_Knowledge_Retention","345494460_Board_games_for_teaching_English_prosody_to_advanced_EFL_learners","336087735_Massively_Multiplayer_Online_Gaming_as_a_Constellation_of_Literacy_Practices","331525530_Evaluation_of_an_educational_board_game_to_improve_use_of_the_partograph_in_sub-Saharan_Africa_A_quasi-experimental_study","330602531_Board_game_improves_the_learning_process_in_small-animal_diagnostic_imaging","330062584_Game-Based_Learning_to_Engage_Students_With_Physics_and_Astronomy_Using_a_Board_Game"]}
