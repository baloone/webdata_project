{"id":"310436098_Authentication_system_for_stateless_RESTful_Web_service","abstract":"REST protocol is a commonly used Web-based communication interface in various areas (e.g., Web service, IoT devices). Current REST protocol faces several challenges to solve the authentication system. This paper describes an ID-based authentication algorithm using Boneh-Franklin ID-based encryption to achieve a secure and stateless RESTful Web service. This ID-based authentication process allows a server to handle client requests by acknowledging the client's URI rather than storing client's state, thereby simplifying the process. This paper discusses the shortcomings of current authentication mechanisms, the concept of ID-based encryption (IBE), and the process of stateless secure REST protocol.","authors":["Sungchul Lee","Ju-Yeon Jo","Yoohwan Kim"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering 17(1):1-14","DOI:10.3233/JCM-160677"],"references":["298262824_A_Method_for_Secure_RESTful_Web_Service_A_Method_for_Secure_RESTful_Web_Service","298255553_ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSOR_MONITORING_WITH_SECURE_RESTFUL_WEB_SERVICE","290304741_Performance_testing_of_web-based_data_visualization","286668713_A_Framework_for_Environmental_Monitoring_with_Arduino-Based_Sensors_Using_Restful_Web_Service","286240697_Mindmetrics_Identifying_users_without_their_login_IDs","273096468_Restful_Web_Service_and_Web-Based_Data_Visualization_for_Environmental_Monitoring","261486761_IoT_architecture_to_enable_intercommunication_through_REST_API_and_UPnP_using_IP_ZigBee_and_arduino","316072195_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","307632417_Identity_Based_Cryptosystems_and_Signature_Scheme_In_G_R_Blakley_and_David_Chaum_Eds","265681769_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems"]}
