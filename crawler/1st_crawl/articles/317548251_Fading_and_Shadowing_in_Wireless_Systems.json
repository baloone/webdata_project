{"id":"317548251_Fading_and_Shadowing_in_Wireless_Systems","abstract":"This book offers a comprehensive overview of fading and shadowing in wireless channels. \n\nA number of statistical models including simple, hybrid, compound and cascaded ones are presented along with a detailed discussion of diversity techniques employed to mitigate the effects of fading and shadowing. The effects of co-channel interference before and after the implementation of diversity are also analyzed. To facilitate easy understanding of the models and the analysis, the background on probability and random variables is presented with relevant derivations of densities of the sums, products, ratios as well as order statistics of random variables. The book also provides material on digital modems of interest in wireless systems. \n\nThe updated edition expands the background materials on probability by offering sections on Laplace and Mellin transforms, parameter estimation, statistical testing and receiver operating characteristics. Newer models for fading, shadowing and shadowed fading are included along with the analysis of diversity combining algorithms. In addition, this edition contains a new chapter on Cognitive Radio. \n\nBased on the response from readers of the First Edition, detailed Matlab scripts used in the preparation of this edition are provided. Wherever necessary, Maple scripts used are also provided.","authors":["p mohana Shankar"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-53198-4","Edition: SecondPublisher: Springer NatureISBN: 978-3-319-53198-4"],"references":["3319021_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Statistical_Properties_of_Composite_Gamma-Lognormal_Fading_Channels","3155764_Diversity_Techniques_for_Mobile_Radio_Reception","3473721_Linear_Diversity_Combining_Techniques"]}
