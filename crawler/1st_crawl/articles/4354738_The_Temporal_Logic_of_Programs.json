{"id":"4354738_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Programs","abstract":"A unified approach to program verification is suggested, which applies to both sequential and parallel programs. The main proof method suggested is that of temporal reasoning in which the time dependence of events is the basic concept. Two formal systems are presented for providing a basis for temporal reasoning. One forms a formalization of the method of intermittent assertions, while the other is an adaptation of the tense logic system Kb, and is particularly suitable for reasoning about concurrent programs.","authors":["Amir Pnueli"],"meta":["September 1977Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/SFCS.1977.32","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Foundations of Computer Science, 1977., 18th Annual Symposium on"],"references":["262315148_Is_sometime_sometimes_better_than_always_Intermittent_assertions_in_proving_program_correctness","221331443_Intermittent_Assertion_Proofs_in_Lucid","220422909_Verifying_Properties_of_Parallel_Programs_An_Axiomatic_Approach","220421565_Formal_Verification_of_Parallel_Programs","316320204_LEP_Library_of_Exact_Philosophy","313550915_An_Axiomatic_Basis_of_Computer_Programming","266695375_A_uniform_logical_basis_for_the_description_specification_and_verification_of_programs","247588383_Some_philosophical_Problems_from_the_Point_of_View_of_Artificial_intelligence","242582218_Formal_description_of_program_structure_and_semantics_in_first_order_logic","242502673_Assigning_Meanings_to_Programs","242467469_Assigning_meaning_to_programs","238715869_Proving_that_computer_programs_terminate_cleanly","238672715_Mathematical_Theory_of_Computation","235032440_Formalization_of_properties_of_parallel_programs","234816615_Propositional_modal_logic_of_programs","227998801_Semantical_Analysis_of_Modal_Logic_I_Normal_Modal_Propositional_Calculi","223295612_Proving_assertions_about_parallel_programs","221591910_Computability_and_Completeness_in_Logics_of_Programs_Preliminary_Report","221590883_On_the_Theory_of_Programming_Logics","221329686_Program_Proving_as_Hand_Simulation_with_a_Little_Induction","220898845_Event_Based_Reasoning_-_A_System_for_Proving_Correct_Termination_of_Programs","220897973_Logical_Rules_of_Natural_Reasoning_about_Programs","220197854_Axiomatic_Approach_to_Total_Correctness_of_Programs","220197726_An_Axiomatic_Proof_Technique_for_Parallel_Programs_I","220197307_A_Proof_Method_for_Cyclic_Programs","220071276_Proving_the_Correctness_of_Multiprocess_Programs","200031796_Towards_a_Theory_of_Parallel_Programming","2547748_Computability_and_Completeness_in_Logics_of_Programs_Preliminary_Report"]}
