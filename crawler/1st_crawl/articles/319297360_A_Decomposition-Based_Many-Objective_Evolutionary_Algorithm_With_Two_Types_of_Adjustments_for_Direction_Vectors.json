{"id":"319297360_A_Decomposition-Based_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_With_Two_Types_of_Adjustments_for_Direction_Vectors","abstract":"Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm has shown its advantage in addressing many-objective optimization problem (MaOP). To further improve its convergence on MaOPs and its diversity for MaOPs with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs, e.g., degenerate and disconnected ones), we proposed a decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm with two types of adjustments for the direction vectors (MaOEA/D-2ADV). At the very beginning, search is only conducted along the boundary direction vectors to achieve fast convergence, followed by the increase of the number of the direction vectors for approximating a more complete PF. After that, a Pareto-dominance-based mechanism is used to detect the effectiveness of each direction vector and the positions of ineffective direction vectors are adjusted to better fit the shape of irregular PFs. The extensive experimental studies have been conducted to validate the efficiency of MaOEA/D-2ADV on many-objective optimization benchmark problems. The effects of each component in MaOEA/D-2ADV are also investigated in detail.","authors":["Xinye Cai","Zhiwei Mei","Zhun Fan"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99):1-14","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2017.2737554"],"references":["289825861_A_Reference_Vector_Guided_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","312983839_20_years_of_evolutionary_multi-objective_optimization_What_has_been_done_and_what_remains_to_be_done","311509063_Searching_for_Pareto-optimal_solutions_through_dimensionality_reduction_for_certain_large-dimensional_multi-objective_optimization_problems","305274844_Performance_of_Decomposition-Based_Many-Objective_Algorithms_Strongly_Depends_on_Pareto_Front_Shapes","303572117_Multiobjective_Optimization_and_Multiple_Constraint_Handling_with_Evolutionary_Algorithms_1_A_Unified_Formulation","290742100_Adaptive_e-Sampling_and_e-Hood_for_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization","285696731_A_multiobjective_evolutionary_algorithm_using_dynamic_weight_design_method","283626012_A-dominance_Angle_based_preference_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm","281313926_A_general-purpose_many-objective_optimizer","277898073_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Objective_Space_Reduction_Diversity_Improvement","276100299_Network_Structural_Balance_Based_on_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Optimization_A_Two-Step_Approach","275243880_A_New_Dominance_Relation_Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","275277446_A_Decomposition_Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many_Objective_Optimization","274263562_Behavior_of_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_on_Many-Objective_Knapsack_Problems","272929205_Nonlinear_Multiobjective_Optimization"]}
