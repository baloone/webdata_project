{"id":"3175569_ESPRIT_-_Estimation_of_Signal_Parameters_via_Rotational_Invariance_Techniques","abstract":"An approach to the general problem of signal parameter estimation\nis described. The algorithm differs from its predecessor in that a total\nleast-squares rather than a standard least-squares criterion is used.\nAlthough discussed in the context of direction-of-arrival estimation,\nESPRIT can be applied to a wide variety of problems including accurate\ndetection and estimation of sinusoids in noise. It exploits an\nunderlying rotational invariance among signal subspaces induced by an\narray of sensors with a translational invariance structure. The\ntechnique, when applicable, manifests significant performance and\ncomputational advantages over previous algorithms such as MEM, Capon's\nMLM, and MUSIC","authors":["Richard Roy","Thomas Kailath"],"meta":["August 1989IEEE Transactions on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing 37(7):984 - 995","DOI:10.1109/29.32276","SourceIEEE Xplore","Project: Stanford Information Systems Lab project"],"references":["304777368_Detection_and_Estimation_of_Superimposed_Signals","270218533_Performance_Comparison_of_Superresolution_Array_Processing_Algorithms","229057939_The_Differentiation_of_Pseudo-Inverses_and_Nonlinear_Least_Squares_Problems_Whose_Variables_Separate","3177134_Improving_the_resolution_of_bearing_in_passive_sonar_arrays_by_eigenvalue_analysis","314751430_An_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","239019754_A_Signal_Subspace_Approach_to_Multiple_Emitter_Location_Spectral_Estimation","213881156_Linpack_Users_Guide","38366194_Asymptotic_Theory_for_Principal_Component_Analysis","38358642_Estimation_in_a_Multivariate_Errors_in_Variables_Regression_Model_Large_Sample_Results","3791244_Multiple_invariance_ESPRIT","3745352_Estimation_of_Signal_Parameters_via_Rotational_Invariance_Techniques_-_ESPRIT","3178124_ESPRIT-A_Subspace_Rotation_Approach_to_Estimation_of_Parameters_of_Cisoids_in_Noise","2997538_A_Subspace_Rotation_Approach_to_Signal_Parameter_Estimation"]}
