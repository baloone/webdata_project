Quantitative studies were critically evaluated based on Thomas et al.'s framework, while the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was used to appraise the rigour of the qualitative studies.\n\nResults\nSeventeen quantitative and three qualitative studies were included. The findings suggest a largely positive influence of mobile technologies on various clinical practice and educational outcomes. However, robust evidence was limited. Use of mobile technologies in health care are associated with improvements in access to information, accuracy and efficiency, evidence‐based decision making at the point of care and enhancement in performance, confidence and engagement in different contexts.","authors":["Ping Guo","Kim Watts","Heather Wharrad"],"meta":["October 2015Nursing Open 3(2):n/a-n/a","DOI:10.1002/nop2.37"],"references":["269396288_Nurses'_Use_of_Mobile_Devices_to_Access_Information_in_Health_Care_Environments_in_Australia_A_Survey_of_Undergraduate_Students","262039199_Students_prescribing_emergency_drug_infusions_utilising_smartphones_outperform_consultants_using_BNFCs","228744532_Mobile_Learning_in_Nursing_Practice_Education_Applying_Koole's_FRAME_Model","344045985_Effects_of_Hot_Spots_Policing_on_Crime","290517480_Palm_perspectives_The_use_of_personal_digital_assistants_in_nursing_clinical_education_A_qualitative_study","288879151_Role_of_Mobile_Phone_in_Spreading_Hospital_Acquired_Infection_A_Study_in_Different_Group_of_Health_Care_Workers","246515289_CRD's_Guidance_for_Undertaking_Reviews_in_Health_Care","221721264_NHS_Connecting_for_Health_Healthcare_Professionals_Mobile_Technology_and_Infection_Control","220302116_Challenges_Methodologies_and_Issues_in_the_Usability_Testing_of_Mobile_Applications","215615217_Proceedings_of_the_23rd_Annual_Ascilite_Conference_Who's_learning_Whose_Technology"]}
