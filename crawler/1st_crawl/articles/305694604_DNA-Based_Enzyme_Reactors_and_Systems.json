{"id":"305694604_DNA-Based_Enzyme_Reactors_and_Systems","abstract":"During recent years, the possibility to create custom biocompatible nanoshapes using DNA as a building material has rapidly emerged. Further, these rationally designed DNA structures could be exploited in positioning pivotal molecules, such as enzymes, with nanometer-level precision. This feature could be used in the fabrication of artificial biochemical machinery that is able to mimic the complex reactions found in living cells. Currently, DNA-enzyme hybrids can be used to control (multi-enzyme) cascade reactions and to regulate the enzyme functions and the reaction pathways. Moreover, sophisticated DNA structures can be utilized in encapsulating active enzymes and delivering the molecular cargo into cells. In this review, we focus on the latest enzyme systems based on novel DNA nanostructures: enzyme reactors, regulatory devices and carriers that can find uses in various biotechnological and nanomedical applications.","authors":["Veikko Linko","Sami Nummelin","Laura Aarnos","Kosti Tapio"],"meta":["July 2016Nanomaterials 6(8):139","DOI:10.3390/nano6080139","Project: Molecular scale devices based on DNA origami"],"references":["298913978_Regulation_at_a_distance_of_biomolecular_interactions_using_a_DNA_origami_nanoactuator","294278277_Nanocaged_enzymes_with_enhanced_catalytic_activity_and_increased_stability_against_protease_digestion","303560591_Designer_nanoscale_DNA_assemblies_programmed_from_the_top_down","303085715_Mechanisms_of_Enhanced_Catalysis_in_Enzyme-DNA_Nanostructures_Revealed_through_Molecular_Simulations_and_Experimental_Analysis","303036731_Cationic_polymers_for_DNA_origami_coating_-_examining_their_binding_efficiency_and_tuning_the_enzymatic_reaction_rates","301943306_Enzymatic_reactions_in_confined_environments","299253643_A_Three-Enzyme_Pathway_with_an_Optimised_Geometric_Arrangement_to_Facilitate_Substrate_Transfer","297590042_Light-Triggered_Release_of_Bioactive_Molecules_from_DNA_Nanostructures","295169929_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_Nanoscale_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","294874227_Spatially_Organized_Enzymes_Drive_Cofactor-Coupled_Cascade_Reactions"]}
