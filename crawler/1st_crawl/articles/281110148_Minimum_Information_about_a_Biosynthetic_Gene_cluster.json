{"id":"281110148_Minimum_Information_about_a_Biosynthetic_Gene_cluster","abstract":"A wide variety of enzymatic pathways that produce specialized metabolites in bacteria, fungi and plants are known to be encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters. Information about these clusters, pathways and metabolites is currently dispersed throughout the literature, making it difficult to exploit. To facilitate consistent and systematic deposition and retrieval of data on biosynthetic gene clusters, we propose the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) data standard.","authors":["Marnix H Medema","Renzo Kottmann","Pelin Yilmaz","Matthew Cummings"],"meta":["August 2015Nature Chemical Biology 11(9):625-631","DOI:10.1038/nchembio.1890","Project: Bioactive bacterial natural products"],"references":["281807568_IMG-ABC_A_Knowledge_Base_To_Fuel_Discovery_of_Biosynthetic_Gene_Clusters_and_Novel_Secondary_Metabolites","278685809_The_ocean_sampling_day_consortium","277080572_Tara_Oceans_Tara_Oceans_studies_plankton_at_planetary_scale_Introduction","276427142_AntiSMASH_30-A_comprehensive_resource_for_the_genome_mining_of_biosynthetic_gene_clusters","266254513_A_Roadmap_for_Natural_Product_Discovery_Based_on_Large-Scale_Genomics_and_Metabolomics","265345439_The_Earth_Microbiome_project_Successes_and_aspirations","264053047_Insights_into_Secondary_Metabolism_from_a_Global_Analysis_of_Prokaryotic_Biosynthetic_Gene_Clusters","263744842_Metagenomic_small_molecule_discovery_methods","270051709_Minimum_information_about_a_marker_gene_sequence_MIMARKS_and_minimum_information_about_any_x_sequence_MIxS_specifications","262227612_Natural_Product_Proteomining_a_Quantitative_Proteomics_Platform_Allows_Rapid_Discovery_of_Biosynthetic_Gene_Clusters_for_Different_Classes_of_Natural_Products"]}
