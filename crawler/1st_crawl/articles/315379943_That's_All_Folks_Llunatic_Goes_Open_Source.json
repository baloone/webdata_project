{"id":"315379943_That's_All_Folks_Llunatic_Goes_Open_Source","abstract":"It is widely recognized that whenever different data sources need to be integrated into a single target database errors and inconsistencies may arise, so that there is a strong need to apply data-cleaning techniques to repair the data. Despite this need, database research has so far investigated mappings and data repairing essentially in isolation. Unfortunately, schema-mappings and data quality rules interact with each other, so that applying existing algorithms in a pipelined way -- i.e., first exchange then data, then repair the result -- does not lead to solutions even in simple settings. We present the Llunatic mapping and cleaning system, the first comprehensive proposal to handle schema mappings and data repairing in a uniform way. Llunatic is based on the intuition that transforming and cleaning data are different facets of the same problem, unified by their declarative nature. This holistic approach allows us to incorporate unique features into the system, such as configurable user interaction and a tunable trade-off between efficiency and quality of the solutions.","authors":["Floris Geerts","Giansalvatore Mecca","Paolo Papotti","Donatello Santoro"],"meta":["August 2014Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 7(13)","DOI:10.14778/2733004.2733031"],"references":["269306315_Mapping_and_cleaning","258448746_The_LLUNATIC_data-cleaning_framework","220538287_Spicy_an_Open-Source_Tool_for_Second-Generation_Schema_Mapping_and_Data_Exchange","316698230_Master_Data_Management","298457573_Master_Data_Management","266653693_NADEEF_a_commodity_data_cleaning_system","260078956_Foundations_of_Data_Quality_Management","257158040_Core_schema_mappings_Scalable_core_computations_in_data_exchange","2845165_Translating_Web_Data","2566500_Data_Exchange_Semantics_and_Query_Answering"]}
