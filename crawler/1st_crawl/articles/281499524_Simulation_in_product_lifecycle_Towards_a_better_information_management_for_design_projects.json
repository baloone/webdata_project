{"id":"281499524_Simulation_in_product_lifecycle_Towards_a_better_information_management_for_design_projects","abstract":"The Digital Factory aims to provide simulation tools jor the design of a product and its production system in parallel. However, the Digital Factory is underused in the industries because of the lack of organization and methodology supports, of the variety of simulation tools that compose it, and finally of the amount of data and information generated without tools or information management system suitable jor this approach. In this work, we focus on this last point and we propose a tool of integration and information management jor product/process simulations throughout the product lifecycle. This tool must be capable of integrating different business views (design, manufacturing, simulation), coming from different information systems.","authors":["Roberta Costa Affonso","Vincent Cheutet","Mohamed Ayadi","Mohamed Haddar"],"meta":["May 2013"],"references":["280940066_Design_methodologies_Industrial_and_educational_applications","314755795_Japanese_Manufacturing_Techniques_Nine_Hidden_Lessons_in_Simplicity","279835410_The_Lean_Innovation_Roadmap_-_A_Systematic_Approach_to_Introducing_Lean_in_Product_Development_Processes_and_Establishing_a_Learning_Organization","267485737_CAE_Data_Management_Using_Traditional_PDM_Systems","259329155_Engineering_Design_A_Systematic_Approach","245385691_A_manufacturing_model_representation_of_a_flexible_manufacturing_facility","245226775_Integration_of_Product_Design_and_Assembly_Planning_in_the_Digital_Factory","237705803_Digital_Factory_-_Integration_of_simulation_enhancing_the_product_and_production_process_towards_operative_control_and_optimization","233505913_An_information_and_knowledge_framework_for_multi-perspective_design_and_manufacture","231649403_Manufacturing_Process_Management_Iterative_synchronisation_of_engineering_data_with_manufacturing_realities"]}
