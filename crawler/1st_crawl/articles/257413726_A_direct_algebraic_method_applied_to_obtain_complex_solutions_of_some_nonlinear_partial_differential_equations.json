{"id":"257413726_A_direct_algebraic_method_applied_to_obtain_complex_solutions_of_some_nonlinear_partial_differential_equations","abstract":"By using some exact solutions of an auxiliary ordinary differential equation, a direct algebraic method is described to construct the exact complex solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations. The method is implemented for the NLS equation, a new Hamiltonian amplitude equation, the coupled Schrödinger-KdV equations and the Hirota-Maccari equations. New exact complex solutions are obtained. Editorial remark: There are doubts about a proper peer-reviewing procedure of this journal. The editor-in-chief has retired, but, according to a statement of the publisher, articles accepted under his guidance are published without additional control.","authors":["Huiqun Zhang"],"meta":["February 2009Chaos Solitons & Fractals 39(3):1020–1026","DOI:10.1016/j.chaos.2007.03.002"],"references":["284400560_On_a_class_of_nonlinear_schrodinger_equations_I","282276367_Painleve_analysis_and_Backlund_transformations_for_coupled_generalized_Schrodinger-Boussinesq_system","265347935_On_a_class_of_nonlinear_Schrodinger_equations_III_Special_theories_in_dimensions_1_2_and_3","247575490_Solitary_wave_solutions_for_variant_Boussinesq_equations","243562905_A_New_Hamiltonian_Amplitude_Equation_Governing_Modulated_Wave_Instabilities","243562036_An_N-Soliton_Solution_for_the_Nonlinear_Schrodinger_Equation_Coupled_to_the_Boussinesq_Equation","243332077_Painleve_Analysis_and_Backlund_Transformations_for_Coupled_Generalized_Schrodinger-Boussinesq_Systemfn2fn2Communicated_by_M_Wadati","243022398_On_a_class_of_nonlinear_Schrdinger_equations_II_Scattering_theory_general_case","234940743_Generalized_Hirota_equation_in_21_dimensions","234401450_Exact_envelope-soliton_solutions_of_a_nonlinear_wave_equation","223298676_Applications_of_the_Jacobi_elliptic_function_method_to_special-type_nonlinear_equations","222978844_Extended_tanh-method_and_its_applications_to_nonlinear_equations","222756536_Applications_of_Expansion_to_periodic_wave_solutions_for_a_new_Hamiltonian_amplitude_equation","222143435_On_a_class_of_nonlinear_Schrodinger_equations_I_The_Cauchy_problem_general_case"]}
