{"id":"356584391_Framework_for_Automated_Assessment_Tools_for_Programming_Exercises","abstract":"Students can do better computer programming if one-to-one guidance is given to them. Strength of students in a class makes it difficult in an Indian educational setting. Teacher-Student ratio is almost 1:25, when the preferred ratio is 1:10 preferred for Computer Science. The impact of this can be reduced if there is a strong feedback mechanism. Automated assessment system is a solution. This paper is a comparative analysis of the tools for program assessment written in different languages. The study brings out the distinct attributes of the tools and proposes an enhancement to automated grading system.","authors":["Jaya Mary"],"meta":["April 2020","Project: Auto Assessment of programming exercises"],"references":["303513284_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Assessment_Tools_for_Programming_Assignments","275652921_A_Virtual_Programming_Lab_for_Moodle_with_automatic_assessment_and_anti-plagiarism_features","257717161_Java_Programming_Assessment_Tool_for_Assignment_Module_in_Moodle_E-learning_System","225935337_The_CourseMarker_CBA_System_Improvements_over_Ceilidh","319770462_Code_Complete_A_Practical_Handbook_of_Software_Construction","305081924_Automatic_Grading_of_Programming_Exercises_using_Property-Based_Testing","260587274_Automated_Assessment_in_a_Programming_Tools_Course","233834599_PETCHA_A_programming_exercises_teaching_assistant","232637487_AutoLEP_An_Automated_Learning_and_Examination_System_for_Programming_and_its_Application_in_Programming_Course","228328446_A_Survey_of_Automated_Assessment_Approaches_for_Programming_Assignments","220832207_Static_Analysis_of_Students'_Java_Programs","221537476_Grading_student_programs_using_ASSYST","221368353_ProgTest_An_environment_for_the_submission_and_evaluation_of_programming_assignments_based_on_testing_activities","220807159_Web-CAT_automatically_grading_programming_assignments","220178478_Automatic_Assessment_Aids_for_Pascal_Programs"]}
