{"id":"220809925_Extending_the_power_of_automated_legal_drafting_technology","abstract":"This paper analyzes some fundamental limits posed by the dominant paradigm presently seen in legal drafting software, and describes a new drafting system architecture that has potential to offer significant benefits in expressive power and user experience.
