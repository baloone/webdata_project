{"id":"220366329_Second-Order_Logic_and_Foundations_of_Mathematics","abstract":"We discuss the dierences between first-order set theory and second- order logic as a foundation for mathematics. We analyse these lan- guages in terms of two levels of formalization. The analysis shows that if second-order logic is understood in its full semantics capable of characterizing categorically central mathematical concepts, it re- lies entirely on informal reasoning. On the other hand, if it is given a weak semantics, it loses its power in expressing concepts categori- cally. First-order set theory and second-order logic are not radically dierent: the latter is a major fragment of the former.","authors":["Jouko Väänänen"],"meta":["December 2001Bulletin of Symbolic Logic 7(04):504-520","DOI:10.2307/2687796","SourceDBLP"],"references":["346675622_Subsystems_of_Second_Order_Arithmetic","319394528_Foundations_without_Foundationalism","268753572_Reduction_of_higher-order_logic","267143725_Concerning_The_Problem_of_Axiomatizability_of_the_Field_of_Real_Numbers_in_the_Weak_Second_Order_Logic","266985943_Set_Theory_and_Higher-Order_Logic","266838561_Reductions_in_the_Theory_of_Types","266315792_The_spectrum_problem_I_aleph_varepsilon_-saturated_models_the_main_gap","265460357_Foundations_Without_Foundationalism_A_Case_for_Second-Order_Logic","265443817_Subsystems_of_Second_Order_Arithmetic","264956314_A_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra_and_Geometry"]}
