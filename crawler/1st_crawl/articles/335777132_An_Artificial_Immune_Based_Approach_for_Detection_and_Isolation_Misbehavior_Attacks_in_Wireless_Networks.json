{"id":"335777132_An_Artificial_Immune_Based_Approach_for_Detection_and_Isolation_Misbehavior_Attacks_in_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) is a temporal network, which is managed by autonomous nodes, which have the ability to communicate with each other without having fixed network infrastructure or any central base station. Due to some reasons such as dynamic changes of the network topology, trusting the nodes to each other, lack of fixed substructure for the analysis of nodes' behaviors and loss of specific offensive lines, this type of networks is not supportive against malicious nodes' attacks. One of these attacks is black hole attack. In this attack, the malicious nodes absorb data packets and destroy them. Thus, it is essential to present an algorithm against the black hole attacks. This paper proposed a new approach, which improvement the security of DSR routing protocol to encounter the black hole attacks. This schema tries to identify malicious nodes according to nodes' behaviors in a MANETs and isolate them from routing. The proposed protocol, called AIS-DSR (Artificial Immune System DSR) employ AIS (Artificial Immune System) to defend against black hole attacks. AIS-DSR is evaluated through extensive simulations in the ns-2 environment. The results show that AIS-DSR outperforms other existing solutions in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, packets loss ratio and packets drop ratio.","authors":["Shahram Behzad","Reza Fotohi","Jaber Hosseini Balov","Mohammad javad Rabipour"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Computers 13(6):705-720","DOI:10.17706/jcp.13.6"],"references":["317105900_DAWA_Defending_against_wormhole_attack_in_MANETs_by_using_fuzzy_logic_and_artificial_immune_system","316613459_An_Efficient_Routing_Protocol_in_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Networks_by_using_Artificial_Immune_System","309760883_A_New_Approach_for_Improvement_Security_against_DoS_Attacks_in_Vehicular_Ad-hoc_Network","305766456_P-Method_Improving_AODV_Routing_Protocol_for_Against_Network_Layer_Attacks_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","290594686_An_improvement_over_threads_communications_on_multi-core_processors","289037874_A_simulative_comparison_of_DSDV_and_OLSR_routing_protocols","286925148_A_Secure_Model_For_Prevention_Of_Black_Hole_Attack_In_Wireless_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","311104117_Defending_against_Wormhole_Attack_in_MANET_Using_an_Artificial_Immune_System","295104399_Detection_and_Defense_Technology_of_Blackhole_Attacks_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","283881392_A_modified_algorithm_to_improve_security_and_performance_of_AODV_protocol_against_black_hole_attack","276231733_Improvement_over_the_OLSR_Routing_Protocol_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks_by_Eliminating_the_Unnecessary_Loops","273180277_Passive_IP_Traceback_Disclosing_the_Locations_of_IP_Spoofers_From_Path_Backscatter","272853273_Performance_Evaluation_of_AODV_LHC-AODV_OLSR_UL-OLSR_DSDV_Routing_Protocols","281078298_Quantifying_the_Severity_of_Blackhole_Attack_in_Wireless_Mobile_Adhoc_Networks","274322323_A_Security_and_Trust_Framework_for_Virtualized_Networks_and_Software-Defined_Networking"]}
