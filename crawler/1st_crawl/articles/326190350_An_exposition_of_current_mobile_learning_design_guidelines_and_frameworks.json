{"id":"326190350_An_exposition_of_current_mobile_learning_design_guidelines_and_frameworks","abstract":"As mobile devices with wireless access become more readily available, learning delivered via mobile devices of all types must be designed to ensure successful learning. This paper first examines three questions related to the design of mobile learning: 1) what mobile learning (m-learning) guidelines can be identified in the current literature, 2) what insights can be gained from attempts to bring m-learning to developing countries, and 3) what m-learning frameworks exist and what do they claim about the design of m-learning. Based on an examination of these questions, we aim to synthesize existing guidelines, understand these guidelines in light of the theory of transactional distance and cloud computing, and present a preliminary discussion on why m-learning is not merely an evolution of e-learning. We also identify areas where additional research is needed to further develop guidelines and frameworks for mobile learning supported by cloud computing.
