{"id":"226061622_Model_Checking_Logics_of_Strategic_Ability_Complexity","abstract":"This chapter is about model checking and its complexity in some of the main temporal and strategic logics, e.g. LTL, CTL, and ATL. We discuss several variants of ATL (perfect vs. imperfect recall, perfect vs. imperfect information) as well as two different measures for model checking with concurrent game structures (explicit vs. implicit representation of transitions). Finally, we summarize some results about higher order representations of the underlying models.","authors":["Nils Bulling","J.
