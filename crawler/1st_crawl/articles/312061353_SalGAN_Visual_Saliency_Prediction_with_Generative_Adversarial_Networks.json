{"id":"312061353_SalGAN_Visual_Saliency_Prediction_with_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","abstract":"We introduce SalGAN, a deep convolutional neural network for visual saliency prediction trained with adversarial examples. The first stage of the network consists of a generator model whose weights are learned by back-propagation computed from a binary cross entropy (BCE) loss over downsampled versions of the saliency maps. The resulting prediction is processed by a discriminator network trained to solve a binary classification task between the saliency maps generated by the generative stage and the ground truth ones. Our experiments show how adversarial training allows reaching state-of-the-art performance across different metrics when combined with a widely-used loss function like BCE.","authors":["Junting Pan","Cristian Canton","Kevin McGuinness","Noel Oâ€™Connor"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: Eye Gaze Saliency Prediction"],"references":["311610824_Saliency_Unified_A_Deep_Architecture_for_simultaneous_Eye_Fixation_Prediction_and_Salient_Object_Segmentation","309317278_Exploiting_inter-image_similarity_and_ensemble_of_extreme_learners_for_fixation_prediction_using_deep_features","308896264_DeepGaze_II_Reading_fixations_from_deep_features_trained_on_object_recognition","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311610990_Shallow_and_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Saliency_Prediction","311610376_Eye_Tracking_for_Everyone","311609425_End-to-End_Saliency_Mapping_via_Probability_Distribution_Prediction","308912662_A_Deep_Spatial_Contextual_Long-Term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Network_for_Saliency_Detection","308278061_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution"]}
