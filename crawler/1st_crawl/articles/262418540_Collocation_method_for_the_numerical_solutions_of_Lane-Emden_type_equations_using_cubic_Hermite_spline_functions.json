{"id":"262418540_Collocation_method_for_the_numerical_solutions_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_cubic_Hermite_spline_functions","abstract":"Three numerical techniques based on cubic Hermite spline functions are presented for the solution of Lane–Emden equation. Some properties of Hermite splines are presented and are utilized to reduce the solution of Lane–Emden equation to the solution of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of these techniques.
