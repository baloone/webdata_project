{"id":"222793562_Web-based_expert_system_for_food_dryer_selection","abstract":"This paper describes an integrated web-based fuzzy expert system for food dryer selection. A modular approach to designing the system was employed. It consists of a number of knowledge sources controlled by a scheduler, which communicate through a common blackboard. The system has been fully implemented to run on the web and provides an excellent example of how a number of heterogeneous tools and applications can be integrated on the www. Java was used as the main programming language, and a new server-side technology, Java servlets, was utilised and found to be very effective in integrating different applications on the web. Rule-based knowledge sources and the inference mechanisms were implemented using ReSolver. The system, which also includes ‘foreign’ programs coded in Fortran, clearly demonstrated the integration of the various tools in a seamless user-friendly environment. The structure of the developed system is presented together with example runs to demonstrate its main functionality.","authors":["Haitham Lababidi","Christopher G.J Baker"],"meta":["July 2003Computers & Chemical Engineering 27(7):997-1009","DOI:10.1016/S0098-1354(03)00020-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["238135900_Developments_in_computer-aided_dryer_selection","3273886_Classification_of_power_system_disturbances_using_a_fuzzy_expert_system_and_a_Fourier_Linear_Combiner","290530705_World-Wide_Blackboard","286717490_Information_system_for_selection_of_dryer","238807442_Case-based_reasoning_for_equipment_selection_using_rough_sets_analysis_in_adaptation_phase","237076907_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_Theory_and_Applications","234828206_Multi-agent_planning_for_network_layout_CBR_CLIPS_Java_knowledge_base_management_work_together","233475097_A_Fuzzy_Expert_System_for_the_Selection_of_Spray-Drying_Equipment","233285902_A_New_Algorithm_for_Dryer_Selection","233018314_Progress_in_dryer_selection_techniques","232954784_Development_of_a_fuzzy_expert_system_for_the_selection_of_batch_dryers_for_foodstuffs","228573982_Use_of_a_fuzzy_machine_learning_technique_in_the_knowledge_acquisition_process","227674413_Internet-based_expert_systems","226919143_Blackboard_systems","224277786_Intelligold-a_fuzzy_expert_system_for_gold_plant_process_design","223551573_Development_of_an_expert_system_for_underbalanced_drilling_using_fuzzy_logic","223252357_Interactivity_and_collaboration_on_the_WWW_-_Is_the_'WWW_shell'_sufficient","222875186_Rule-based_diagnosis_and_supervision_of_a_pilot-scale_wastewater_treatment_plant_using_fuzzy_logic_techniques","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","3808616_Integrated_system_for_developing_intelligent_electronic_standards_book_with_Internet_capability","3421341_A_fuzzy_expert_system_for_fault_detection_in_statistical_process_control_of_industrial_processes","3354401_Fuzzy_inference_system_to_assist_the_operator_in_reactive_power_control_in_distribution_systems"]}
