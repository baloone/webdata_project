{"id":"290889865_On_the_number_of_maximum_independent_sets_in_Doob_graphs","abstract":"The Doob graph $D(m,n)$ is a distance-regular graph with the same parameters as the Hamming graph $H(2m+n,4)$. The maximum independent sets in the Doob graphs are analogs of the distance-$2$ MDS codes in the Hamming graphs. We prove that the logarithm of the number of the maximum independent sets in $D(m,n)$ grows as $2^{2m+n-1}(1+o(1))$. The main tool for the upper estimation is constructing an injective map from the class of maximum independent sets in $D(m,n)$ to the class of distance-$2$ MDS codes in $H(2m+n,4)$.","authors":["Denis S Krotov"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.17377/semi.2015.12.043"],"references":["45892784_On_the_number_of_n-ary_quasigroups_of_finite_order","2213305_n-Ary_Quasigroups_of_Order_4","2130268_On_reconstructing_reducible_n-ary_quasigroups_and_switching_subquasigroups","2127723_Asymptotics_for_the_number_of_n-quasigroups_of_order_4","278691299_On_the_Number_of_Latin_Squares","275501784_Distance_Regular_Graphs","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","233932988_Distance-Regular_Graphs","220533560_A_Census_of_Small_Latin_Hypercubes"]}
