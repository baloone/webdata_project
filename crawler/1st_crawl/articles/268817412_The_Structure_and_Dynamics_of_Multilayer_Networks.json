{"id":"268817412_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Multilayer_Networks","abstract":"In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the\ninteraction among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging\nfrom biological to technological, and social systems. However, up until\nrecently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all\ncomponents were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra\ninformation about the temporal- or context-related properties of the\ninteractions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the\nenhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their\ninterest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly\nconsidered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a\ncomprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs\nmade of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover\nseveral relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural\nmeasures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects\nprocesses and dynamics.","authors":["Stefano Boccaletti","Ginestra Bianconi","Regino Criado Herrero","C.I.del Genio"],"meta":["November 2014Physics Reports 544(1):1-122","DOI:10.1016/j.physrep.2014.07.001"],"references":["275840537_Nonprofit_Organizations_in_an_Age_of_Uncertainty_A_Study_of_Organizational_Change","273967914_Selected_Issues_of_QoS_Provision_in_Heterogenous_Military_Networks","270669235_Generalized_Mutual_Synchronization_between_Two_Controlled_Interdependent_Networks","265439384_Interlacing_eigenvalues_and_graphs","263278276_Synchronization_of_Interconnected_Networks_The_Role_of_Connector_Nodes","263028744_Network_robustness_of_multiplex_networks_with_interlayer_degree_correlations","262829361_HAR_Hub_Authority_and_Relevance_Scores_in_Multi-Relational_Data_for_Query_Search","262338697_Communicability_reveals_a_transition_to_coordinated_behavior_in_multiplex_networks","262338193_Weak_percolation_on_multiplex_networks","261732150_Structural_measures_for_multiplex_networks","261257437_Self-organization_towards_optimally_interdependent_networks_by_means_of_coevolution","261034186_Biased_imitation_in_coupled_evolutionary_games_in_interdependent_networks","260959784_Evolutionary_Prisoners_Dilemma_game_on_a_square_lattice","260947044_Voter_model_on_the_two-clique_graph","260841109_Epidemics_in_Partially_Overlapped_Multiplex_Networks","260836610_Slowed_yet_explosive_global_cascades_driven_by_response_heterogeneity_in_multiplex_networks","260605715_Measuring_and_modeling_correlations_in_multiplex_networks","260441727_Cavity-based_robustness_analysis_of_interdependent_networks_Influences_of_intranetwork_and_internetwork_degree-degree_correlations","260393704_Social_Bootstrapping_How_Pinterest_and_Lastfm_Social_Communities_Benefit_by_Borrowing_Links_from_Facebook","260195943_Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking_in_Interdependent_Networked_Game","260147106_Connecting_Dream_Networks_Across_Cultures","301608465_Global_tuberculosis_control_WHO_report_2001","291974275_Mixture_models_and_exploratory_analysis_in_networks","289514386_Community_Detection_in_Multi-relational_Social_Networks","284603425_The_noordin_top_terrorist_network","282753288_Communities_Unfolding_in_Multislice_Networks","279548970_Two_Genes_Predict_Voter_Turnout","275683000_A_Theory_of_Social_Structure","271950949_A_fixed_degree_sequence_model_for_the_one-mode_projection_of_multiplex_bipartite_graphs","271526599_Uber_die_Abgrenzung_der_Eigenwerte_einer_Matrix","271386638_Exponential_Random_Graph_Models_for_Social_Networks_Theory_Methods_and_Applications","268988361_A_Perron-Frobenius_theory_for_block_matrices_associated_to_a_multiplex_network","268817464_COMPLEX_NETWORKS","268675958_The_Calculus_of_Selfishness","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","263908479_HYPERSTRUCTURES_A_NEW_APPROACH_TO_COMPLEX_SYSTEMS","263796506_SLOWER_IS_FASTER_FOSTERING_CONSENSUS_FORMATION_BY_HETEROGENEOUS_INERTIA","263549993_Absorbing_and_shattered_fragmentation_transitions_in_multilayer_coevolution","262937367_Degree_mixing_in_multilayer_networks_impedes_the_evolution_of_cooperation","262397700_Competing_memes_propagation_on_networks","262346800_Adaptive_Fault_Estimation_of_Coupling_Connections_for_Synchronization_of_Complex_Interconnected_Networks","262339228_Multiple_resource_demands_and_viability_in_multiplex_networks","262297520_RMiCS_A_robust_approach_for_mining_coherent_subgraphs_in_edge-labeled_multi-layer_graphs","261282975_Effect_of_coupling_on_the_epidemic_threshold_in_interconnected_complex_networks_A_spectral_analysis","261088073_Are_All_Social_Networks_Structurally_Similar","260635489_Competing_Memes_Propagation_on_Networks_A_Network_Science_Perspective","260522557_Modeling_triple-diffusions_of_infectious_diseases_information_and_preventive_behaviors_through_a_metropolitan_social_network-An_agent-based_simulation","260441718_Emergence_of_overlap_in_ensembles_of_spatial_multiplexes_and_statistical_mechanics_of_spatial_interacting_network_ensembles","260428993_Layered_Percolation","260132483_Multiple_routes_transmitted_epidemics_on_multiplex_networks","260022183_Multiple_percolation_transitions_in_a_configuration_model_of_network_of_networks","260021991_Mutually_connected_component_of_network_of_networks","260004221_Percolation_of_a_general_network_of_networks","259961528_Free-Riding_Behavior_in_Vaccination_Decisions_An_Experimental_Study","260129808_Rewarding_evolutionary_fitness_with_links_between_populations_promotes_cooperation"]}
