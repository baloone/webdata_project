{"id":"332703225_Automatic_Classification_of_Algorithm_Citation_Functions_in_Scientific_Literature","abstract":"Computer sciences and related disciplines evolve around developing, evaluating, and applying algorithms. Typically, an algorithm is not developed from scratch, but uses and builds upon existing ones, which often are proposed and published in scholarly articles. The ability to capture this evolution relationship among these algorithms in scientific literature would not only allow us to understand how a particular algorithm is composed, but also shed light on large-scale analysis of algorithmic evolution through different temporal spans and thematic scales. We propose to capture such evolution relationship between two algorithms by investigating the knowledge represented in citation contexts, where authors explain how cited algorithms are used in their works. A set of heterogeneous ensemble machine-learning methods is proposed, where the combination of two base classifiers trained with heterogeneous feature types is used to automatically identify the algorithm usage relationship. The proposed heterogeneous ensemble methods achieve the best average F1 of 0.749 and 0.905 for fine-grained and binary algorithm citation function classification, respectively. The success of this study will allow us to generate a large-scale algorithm citation network from a collection of scholarly documents representing multiple time spans, venues, and fields of study.","authors":["Suppawong Tuarob","Sung Woo Kang","Poom Wettayakorn","Chanatip Pornprasit"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2019.2913376"],"references":["325252787_Neural_ParsCit_a_deep_learning-based_reference_string_parser","319472501_Machine_Learning_for_the_Geosciences_Challenges_and_Opportunities","317679430_Variants_of_RMSProp_and_Adagrad_with_Logarithmic_Regret_Bounds","313952403_Improving_pseudo-code_detection_in_ubiquitous_scholarly_data_using_ensemble_machine_learning","300369330_AlgorithmSeer_A_System_for_Extracting_and_Searching_for_Algorithms_in_Scholarly_Big_Data","271724888_Quantifying_Product_Favorability_and_Extracting_Notable_Product_Features_Using_Large_Scale_Social_Media_Data","262358547_Scalable_Text_Classification_with_Sparse_Generative_Modeling","262166051_Context-enhanced_citation_sentiment_detection","260914943_An_Ensemble_Heterogeneous_Classification_Methodology_for_Discovering_Health-Related_Knowledge_in_Social_Media_Messages","230682740_Ensemble-style_Self-training_on_Citation_Classification","228928798_Summarizing_Figures_Tables_and_Algorithms_in_Scientific_Publications_to_Augment_Search_Results","221008813_Dynamic_power_minimization_during_combinational_circuit_testing_as_a_traveling_salesman_problem","220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","329547332_Measuring_the_Evolution_of_a_Scientific_Field_through_Citation_Frames","324976469_Identifying_Important_Citations_using_Contextual_Information_from_Full_Text","320816769_Detecting_Target_Text_Related_to_Algorithmic_Efficiency_in_Scholarly_Big_Data_Using_Recurrent_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","304243071_A_hybrid_approach_to_discover_semantic_hierarchical_sections_in_scholarly_documents","291118125_CiteSeerx_A_Scholarly_Big_Dataset","288906520_Random_forests","275407660_A_generalized_topic_modeling_approach_for_automatic_document_annotation","266711003_Introduction_to_algorithms_3rd_revised_and_extended_ed","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","261633619_A_classification_scheme_for_algorithm_citation_function_in_scholarly_works","261633461_Automatic_Detection_of_Pseudocodes_in_Scholarly_Documents_Using_Machine_Learning","249721910_Science_Studies_Bibliometric_and_Content_Analysis","244442722_Some_Results_on_the_Function_and_Quality_of_Citation","225151735_Mean-Variance_Analysis_A_New_Document_Ranking_Theory_in_Information_Retrieval","224220444_Iterative_Accelerated_A_Path_Planning","224171014_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Identifying_Disease-Treatment_Relations_in_Short_Texts","221996591_The_PageRank_Citation_Ranking_Bringing_Order_to_the_Web","221013267_Automatic_classification_of_citation_function","220746860_ParsCit_an_Open-source_CRF_Reference_String_Parsing_Package","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","27685884_Graph_Clustering_by_Flow_Simulation","8000889_The_Kappa_Statistic_in_Reliability_Studies_Use_Interpretation_and_Sample_Size_Requirements"]}
