{"id":"278619546_High-slope_Terrain_Locomotion_for_Torque-Controlled_Quadruped_Robots","abstract":"Research into legged robotics is primarily motivated\nby the prospects of building machines that are able to\nnavigate in challenging and complex environments that are\npredominantly non-flat. In this context, control of contact\nforces is fundamental to ensure stable contacts and stability of the robot. In this paper\nwe propose a planning/control framework for quasi-static walking of quadrupedal\nrobots, implemented for a demanding application in which regulation of ground reaction\nforces is crucial. Experimental results demonstrate that our 75-kg quadruped robot is\nable to walk inside two high-slope (50Â°) V-shaped walls; an achievement that to the\nauthors' best knowledge has never been presented before. Furthermore, the robot is\ndistributing its weight among the stance legs so as to optimize user-defined criteria. We\ncompute joint torques that result in no foot slippage, fulfillment of the unilateral\nconstraints of the contact forces and minimization of the actuators effort. This paper\npresents an experimental study that compares the proposed framework with different\nstate-of-the-art control strategies, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of\nour approach.","authors":["Michele Focchi","Andrea Del Prete","Ioannis Havoutis","Roy Featherstone"],"meta":["January 2017Autonomous Robots 41(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10514-016-9573-1"],"references":["289828824_Identification_of_dynamics_of_humanoids_Systematic_exciting_motion_generation","282477851_Optimization-based_locomotion_planning_estimation_and_control_design_for_the_atlas_humanoid_robot","272196430_Team_IHMC's_lessons_learned_from_the_DARPA_robotics_challenge_trials","262048609_Design_of_HyQ_-A_hydraulically_and_electrically_actuated_quadruped_robot","257523149_Centroidal_dynamics_of_a_humanoid_robot","308826888_Optimization_based_controller_design_and_implementation_for_the_Atlas_robot_in_the_DARPA_Robotics_Challenge_Finals","274599380_Virtual_Model_Control_An_Intuitive_Approach_for_Bipedal_Locomotion","268236012_qpOASES_A_parametric_active-set_algorithm_for_quadratic_programming","267715938_The_SL_SL_Simulation_and_Real-Time_Control_Software_Package","261353761_Code_generation_of_algebraic_quantities_for_robot_controllers","257523115_A_momentum-based_balance_controller_for_humanoid_robots_on_non-level_and_non-stationary_ground","254041142_Dynamic_torque_control_of_a_hydraulic_quadruped_robot","243971940_State_Estimation_for_Legged_Robots_-_Consistent_Fusion_of_Leg_Kinematics_and_IMU","243971891_Control_of_Dynamic_Gaits_for_a_Quadrupedal_Robot","243971885_Hybrid_Operational_Space_Control_for_Compliant_Legged_Systems"]}
