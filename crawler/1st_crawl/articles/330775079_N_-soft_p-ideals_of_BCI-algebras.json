{"id":"330775079_N_-soft_p-ideals_of_BCI-algebras","abstract":"In this paper, using the notion of soft sets and N-structures, the notion of N-soft p-ideals in BCI-algebras is introduced, and related properties are investigated. Relations between N-soft ideals and N-soft p-ideals are discussed. Conditions for an N-soft ideal to be an N-soft p-ideal are established.","authors":["G.
