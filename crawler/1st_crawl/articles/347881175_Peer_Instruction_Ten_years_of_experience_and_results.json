{"id":"347881175_Peer_Instruction_Ten_years_of_experience_and_results","abstract":"We report data from ten years of teaching with Peer Instruction (PI) in the calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses for nonmajors; our results indicate increased student mastery of both conceptual reasoning and quantitative problem solving upon implementing PI. We also discuss ways we have improved our implementation of PI since introducing it in 1991. Most notably, we have replaced in-class reading quizzes with pre-class written responses to the reading, introduced a research-based mechanics textbook for portions of the course, and incorporated cooperative learning into the discussion sections as well as the lectures. These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.","authors":["Catherine H Crouch","Eric Mazur"],"meta":["August 2001American Journal of Physics 69(9)","DOI:10.1119/1.1374249Í”"],"references":["266461715_FACTORS_THAT_MAKE_PEER_INSTRUCTION_WORK_A_700-USER_SURVEY","252734813_Student_Expectations_in_Introductory_Physics","243491495_Comparing_problem_solving_performance_of_physics_students_in_inquiry-based_and_traditional_introductory_physics_courses","232994665_Navigating_the_Bumpy_Road_to_Student-Centered_Instruction","216743206_A_Mechanics_Baseline_Test","249654270_Peer_instruction_An_interactive_approach_for_large_lecture_classes","232554260_Half_a_Minute_Predicting_Teacher_Evaluations_From_Thin_Slices_of_Nonverbal_Behavior_and_Physical_Attractiveness","33520270_An_investigation_of_student_difficulties_in_qualitative_and_quantitative_problem_solving_examples_from_electric_circuits_and_electrostatics"]}
