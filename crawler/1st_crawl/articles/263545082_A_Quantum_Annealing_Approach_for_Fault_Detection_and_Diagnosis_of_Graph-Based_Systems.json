{"id":"263545082_A_Quantum_Annealing_Approach_for_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_Graph-Based_Systems","abstract":"Diagnosing the minimal set of faults capable of explaining a set of given\nobservations, e.g., from sensor readouts, is a hard combinatorial optimization\nproblem usually tackled with artificial intelligence techniques. We present the\nmapping of this combinatorial problem to quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO), and the experimental results of instances embedded onto a\nquantum annealing device with 509 quantum bits. Besides being the first time a\nquantum approach has been proposed for problems in the advanced diagnostics\ncommunity, to the best of our knowledge this work is also the first research\nutilizing the route Problem $\\rightarrow$ QUBO $\\rightarrow$ Direct embedding\ninto quantum hardware, where we are able to implement and tackle problem\ninstances with sizes that go beyond previously reported toy-model\nproof-of-principle quantum annealing implementations; this is a significant\nleap in the solution of problems via direct-embedding adiabatic quantum\noptimization. We discuss some of the programmability challenges in the current\ngeneration of the quantum device as well as a few possible ways to extend this\nwork to more complex arbitrary network graphs.","authors":["Alejandro Perdomo-Ortiz","Joseph Fluegemann","Sriram Narasimhan","Rupak Biswas"],"meta":["June 2014The European Physical Journal Special Topics 224(1)","DOI:10.1140/epjst/e2015-02347-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263967953_Bayesian_Network_Structure_Learning_Using_Quantum_Annealing","263856036_A_case_study_in_programming_a_quantum_annealer_for_hard_operational_planning_problems","263545233_Quantum_Optimization_of_Fully-Connected_Spin_Glasses","263048587_A_practical_heuristic_for_finding_graph_minors","262972623_Third_International_Diagnostic_Competition_-_DXC'11","259695449_Quantum_computing_Defining_and_detecting_quantum_speedup","259604452_Glassy_Chimeras_Could_Be_Blind_to_Quantum_Speedup_Designing_Better_Benchmarks_for_Quantum_Annealing_Machines","310911776_A_case_study_in_programming_a_quantum_annealer_for_hard_operational_planning_problems","272684392_Parametrized_Families_of_Hard_Planning_Problems_from_Phase_Transitions","262350799_Experimental_Evaluation_of_an_adiabiatic_quantum_system_for_combinatorial_optimization"]}
