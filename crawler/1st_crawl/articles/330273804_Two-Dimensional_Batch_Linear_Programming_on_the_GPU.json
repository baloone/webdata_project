{"id":"330273804_Two-Dimensional_Batch_Linear_Programming_on_the_GPU","abstract":"This paper presents a novel, high-performance, graphical processing unit-based algorithm for efficiently solving two-dimensional linear programs in batches. The domain of two-dimensional linear programs is particularly useful due to the prevalence of relevant geometric problems. Batch linear programming refers to solving numerous different linear programs within one operation. By solving many linear programs simultaneously and distributing workload evenly across threads, graphical processing unit utilization can be maximized. Speedups of over 22 times and 63 times are obtained against state-of-the-art graphics processing unit and CPU linear program solvers, respectively.","authors":["John Charlton","Steve Maddock","Paul Richmond"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing 126","DOI:10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.01.001"],"references":["323392213_Simultaneous_Solving_of_Batched_Linear_Programs_on_a_GPU","311489325_Gunrock_a_high-performance_graph_processing_library_on_the_GPU","308646528_Solving_Batched_Linear_Programs_on_GPU_and_Multicore_CPU","268693691_Efficient_GPU-based_implementations_of_simplex_type_algorithms","262196067_GPU_Accelerated_Pivoting_Rules_for_the_Simplex_Algorithm","258698513_GPU_Acceleration_of_the_Matrix-Free_Interior_Point_Method","257252061_Graphics_processing_unit_GPU_programming_strategies_and_trends_in_GPU_computing","225568277_Towards_a_practical_parallelisation_of_the_simplex_method","220951550_Efficient_Implementation_of_the_Simplex_Method_on_a_CPU-GPU_System","220949325_Linear_optimization_on_modern_GPUs","266036455_Implementing_an_interior_point_method_for_linear_programs_on_a_CPU-GPU_system","245658146_Cholesky_Decomposition_and_Linear_Programming_on_a_GPU","235622476_CUDA_programming_guide","224655629_A_neutral_net_linear_programming_solver","224140961_An_efficient_GPU_implementation_of_the_revised_simplex_method","220452842_Small-Dimensional_Linear_Programming_and_Convex_Hulls_Made_Easy","3216523_Parallel_Computing_Experiences_with_CUDA","2820933_Randomized_Algorithms_for_Linear_Programming"]}
