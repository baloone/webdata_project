{"id":"322106253_2D_and_3D_virtual_interactive_laboratories_of_physics_on_Unity_platform","abstract":"Using the cross-platform game engine Unity, we develop virtual laboratories for PC, consoles, mobile devices and website as an innovative tool to study physics. There is extensive uptake of ICT in the teaching of science and its impact on the learning, and considering the limited availability of laboratories for physics teaching and the difficulties this causes in the learning of school students, we design the virtual laboratories to enhance studentâĂŹs knowledge of concepts in physics. To achieve this goal, we use Unity due to provide support bump mapping, reflection mapping, parallax mapping, dynamics shadows using shadows maps, full-screen post-processing effects and render-to-texture. Unity can use the best variant for the current video hardware and, if none are compatible, to use an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for performance. The control over delivery to mobile devices, web browsers, consoles and desktops is the main reason Unity is the best option among the same kind cross-platform. Supported platforms include Android, Apple TV, Linux, iOS, Nintendo 3DS line, macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows Phone 8, Wii but also an asset server and Nvidia's PhysX physics engine which is the most relevant tool on Unity for our PhysLab.","authors":["Jesus David Gonzalez","J H Escobar","Herleidy Sanchez","Jhon De la Hoz"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 935(1):012069","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/935/1/012069"],"references":["265143996_The_Virtual_Museum_of_Minerals_and_Molecules_Molecular_Visualization_in_a_Virtual_Hands-On_Museum","260692356_Teaching_Physics_Figuring_Out_What_Works","236848640_Comparing_the_Influence_of_Physical_and_Virtual_Manipulatives_in_the_Context_of_the_Physics_by_Inquiry_Curriculum_The_Case_of_Undergraduate_Students'_Conceptual_Understanding_of_Heat_and_Temperature","228797372_Point_and_Click_or_Grab_and_Heft_Comparing_the_Influence_of_Physical_and_Virtual_Instructional_Materials_on_Elementary_School_Students'_Ability_to_Design_Experiments","258182773_Going_the_Distance_With_Online_Education","248975140_The_Impact_of_Interactive_Computer_Simulations_on_the_Nature_and_Quality_of_Postgraduate_Science_Teachers'_Explanations_in_Physics","248914026_Conceptual_Construction_of_Fields_Through_Tactile_Interface","248448103_Measuring_intuitive_knowledge_in_science_The_development_of_the_What-If_test","227793838_Preservice_Teachers'_Theory_Development_in_Physical_and_Simulated_Environments","227658194_Hands_on_What_The_Relative_Effectiveness_of_Physical_Versus_Virtual_Materials_in_an_Engineering_Design_Project_by_Middle_School_Children"]}
