Problems in real-world practice have been described as messy, complex, and ill-structured, whereas many engineering classroom problems have been described as well-structured with single correct solutions. How do we prepare our students for real-world problem solving? In this collaborative and participant-centered workshop, faculty will be introduced to a novel and adaptive Problem-Based Learning (PBL) model developed and implemented in JMU's Engineering program over the past eight years and supported by NSF awards. Participants will be provided with PBL theory, PBL examples, a PBL classification framework, assessment tools, and a PBL template for use across courses and curricula.","authors":["Olga Pierrakos","Robin Anderson","Elise M.
