{"id":"313113705_A_Novel_Query-Driven_Clustering-Based_Technique_for_Vertical_Fragmentation_and_Allocation_in_Distributed_Database_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, heuristic query-driven clustering-based vertical fragmentation technique is efficiently\ndeveloped. The intrinsic idea is to meet the idealistic case of DDBS design which comes to happen as\neach query attune “closely match” its relevant fragment. The proposed technique is mainly sought to\nbreed clusters of queries in the first place. Consequently, these clusters would be tacitly used to generate\nintended disjoint fragments. Moreover, the allocation process has been considered so that replicated\nand non-replicated scenarios of data are applied. This technique basically meant to be efficaciously\napplicable at the initial stage of DDBS design without the need for data statistics or empirical results,\nin either dynamic or static DDBS environment. Many existing design-related techniques are being\nincorporated to make a promising work, particularly as communication costs being the foremost design\nobjective. Throughout this work, the experimental results and internal evaluation are extensively\nillustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of proposed technique.","authors":["Adel A.
