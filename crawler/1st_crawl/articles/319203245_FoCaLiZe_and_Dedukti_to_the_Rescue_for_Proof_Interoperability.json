{"id":"319203245_FoCaLiZe_and_Dedukti_to_the_Rescue_for_Proof_Interoperability","abstract":"Numerous contributions have been made for some years to allow users to exchange formal proofs between different provers. The main propositions consist in ad hoc pointwise translations, e.g. between HOL Light and Isabelle in the Flyspeck project or uses of more or less complete certificates. We propose in this paper a methodology to combine proofs coming from different theorem provers. This methodology relies on the Dedukti logical framework as a common formalism in which proofs can be translated and combined. To relate the independently developed mathematical libraries used in proof assistants, we rely on the structuring features offered by FoCaLiZe, in particular parameterized modules and inheritance to build a formal library of transfer theorems called MathTransfer. We finally illustrate this methodology on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which we prove correct using HOL and Coq in combination.","authors":["RaphaÃ«l Cauderlier","Catherine Dubois"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66107-0_9","Conference: International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving"],"references":["282298628_Automated_Deduction_in_the_B_Set_Theory_using_Typed_Proof_Search_and_Deduction_Modulo","280047357_Checking_Zenon_Modulo_Proofs_in_Dedukti","262219008_Scalable_LCF-Style_proof_translation","261952966_FoCaLiZe_Inside_an_F-IDE","221255108_Automatic_Proof_and_Disproof_in_IsabelleHOL","220818752_A_Modular_Integration_of_SATSMT_Solvers_to_Coq_through_Proof_Witnesses","220806461_Experimenting_with_Deduction_Modulo","46396113_Importing_HOL_Light_into_Coq","2390443_A_Prototype_Proof_Translator_from_HOL_to_Coq","308392856_ML_Pattern-Matching_Recursion_and_Rewriting_From_FoCaLiZe_to_Dedukti","307965959_A_Rewrite_System_for_Proof_Constructivization","300162378_Typechecking_in_the_lambda-Pi-Calculus_Modulo_Theory_and_Practice","285653434_A_framework_for_defining_computational_higher-order_logics","280631026_Mixing_HOL_and_Coq_in_Dedukti_Extended_Abstract","280630809_Translating_HOL_to_Dedukti","277023446_Automatic_and_Transparent_Transfer_of_Theorems_along_Isomorphisms_in_the_Coq_Proof_Assistant","267246627_Lifting_and_Transfer_A_Modular_Design_for_Quotients_in_IsabelleHOL","262381052_Matching_Concepts_across_HOL_Libraries","262323451_Foundational_proof_certificates_making_proof_universal_and_permanent","225180642_The_OpenTheory_Standard_Theory_Library","225143834_Importing_mathematics_from_HOL_into_Nuprl","220896486_An_Executable_Formalization_of_the_HOLNuprl_Connection_in_the_Metalogical_Framework_Twelf","220369975_Representing_Model_Theory_in_a_Type-Theoretical_Logical_Framework","2864608_Encoding_the_HOL_Light_logic_in_Coq"]}
