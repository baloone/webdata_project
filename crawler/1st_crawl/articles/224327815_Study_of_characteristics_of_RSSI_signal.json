{"id":"224327815_Study_of_characteristics_of_RSSI_signal","abstract":"Numerous experiments are used in order to discuss the strength of received signal strength index(RSSI) signals due to changes in the environment, and the effects of time domain and frequency domain on RSSI signals has been proposed in this paper. RSSI signal's strength, in connection to the link quality, is categorized as: Good (RSSI >40), Acceptable (35< RSSI < 40), and Poor (RSSI < 35), under the circumstances when the data rate is at 2 Mbps. From this experiment, we learn that the sampling time does not have any relationship to the signal. Moreover, when RSSI signals are placed in the time domain and frequency domain, there is no sign of periodic phnomenon. Lastly, RSSI signals' variance and its strength are not directly related to each other, but they are individually depended on the environment complexity.","authors":["Rong-Hou Wu","Yang-Han Lee","Hsien-Wei Tseng","Yih Jan"],"meta":["May 2008","DOI:10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608603","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Industrial Technology, 2008.
