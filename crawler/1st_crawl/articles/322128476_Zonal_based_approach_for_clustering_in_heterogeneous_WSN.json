{"id":"322128476_Zonal_based_approach_for_clustering_in_heterogeneous_WSN","abstract":"Huge attention of the researchers is drawn by the wireless sensor network (WSN) due to its applicability in variety of applications. WSN has tiny size low powered device called sensors with an objective to monitor the area of interest. In many applications of WSN, it is impossible to modify the topology or to replace the battery based power supply of the sensor nodes. Hence elongation of network lifetime is required to meet the objective of setting up the network. In this paper, a zonal based clustering technique is proposed wherein the field is divided into zones. The selection of cluster head is dynamic so as to balance the load with even dissipation of power by the deployed Sensor Node. The proposed work is compared with DEEC, SEP, Z-SEP and LEACH protocol and simulation validates the protocol with elongated stability region and extended life time with more successful packet delivery to base station.","authors":["Pawan Singh Mehra","M.
