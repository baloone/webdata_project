{"id":"341645594_Exploring_the_roles_of_high-speed_train_air_and_coach_services_in_the_spread_of_COVID-19_in_China","abstract":"To understand the roles of different transport modes in the spread of COVID-19 pandemic across Chinese cities, this paper looks at the factors influencing the number of imported cases from Wuhan and the spread speed and pattern of the pandemic. We find that frequencies of air flights and high-speed train (HST) services out of Wuhan are significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the destination cities. The presence of an airport or HST station at a city is significantly related to the speed of the pandemic spread, but its link with the total number of confirmed cases is weak. The farther the distance from Wuhan, the lower number of cases in a city and the slower the dissemination of the pandemic. The longitude and latitude coordinates do not have a significant relationship with the number of total cases but can increase the speed of the COVID-19 spread. Specifically, cities in the higher longitudinal region tended to record a COVID-19 case earlier than their counterparties in the west. Cities in the north were more likely to report the first case later than those in the south. The pandemic may emerge in large cities earlier than in small cities as GDP is a factor positively associated with the spread speed.","authors":["Yahua Zhang","Anming Zhang","Jiaoe Wang"],"meta":["May 2020Transport Policy 94","DOI:10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.05.012"],"references":["342118086_Temperature_Humidity_and_Latitude_Analysis_to_Estimate_Potential_Spread_and_Seasonality_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19","330368909_Roles_of_Different_Transport_Modes_in_the_Spatial_Spread_of_the_2009_Influenza_AH1N1_Pandemic_in_Mainland_China","316021211_Impacts_of_high-speed_rail_lines_on_the_city_network_in_China","259322075_The_Hidden_Geometry_of_Complex_Network-Driven_Contagion_Phenomena","49756195_Is_public_transport_a_risk_factor_for_acute_respiratory_infection","24092013_Estimating_Trade_Flows_Trading_Partners_And_Trading_Volumes","7133296_Global_Transport_Networks_and_Infectious_Disease_Spread","354176129_Risk_for_Transportation_of_Coronavirus_Disease_from_Wuhan_to_Other_Cities_in_China","339852916_Temperature_and_Latitude_Analysis_to_Predict_Potential_Spread_and_Seasonality_for_COVID-19","338974077_A_comprehensive_method_for_the_robustness_assessment_of_high-speed_rail_network_with_operation_data_A_case_in_China","335533521_Vulnerability_analysis_and_critical_area_identification_of_public_transport_system_A_case_of_high-speed_rail_and_air_transport_coupling_system_in_China","334377750_Measuring_multi-modal_connections_and_connectivity_radiations_of_transport_infrastructure_in_China","334039997_Impacts_of_high-speed_rail_on_airlines_airports_and_regional_economies_A_survey_of_recent_research","332827662_Gravity_Models_in_Air_Transport_Research_A_Survey_and_an_Application","317320140_Connectivity_of_intercity_passenger_transportation_in_China_A_multi-modal_and_network_approach","316466634_Should_China_further_expand_its_high-speed_rail_network_Consider_the_low-cost_carrier_factor","314576705_Determinants_of_Air_Passenger_Flows_in_China_and_Gravity_Model_Deregulation_LCC_and_High_Speed_Rail","312729484_Regression_quantiles","280569570_The_roles_of_transportation_and_transportation_hubs_in_the_propagation_of_influenza_and_coronaviruses_a_systematic_review","270811002_Low_Cost_Carriers_in_China_and_its_Contribution_to_Passenger_Traffic_Flow","239064701_Interpreting_and_Using_Regression","228562329_Exploring_the_Network_Structure_and_Nodal_Centrality_of_China's_Air_Transport_Network_A_Complex_Network_Approach","227735045_Airline_networks_and_the_international_diffusion_of_severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_SARS","8997511_Low_risk_of_transmission_of_severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_on_airplanes_the_Singapore_experience","8065140_Respiratory_Infections_during_Air_Travel"]}
