{"id":"348624050_Functionality_privacy_security_and_rewarding_based_on_fog_assisted_cloud_computing_techniques_in_Internet_of_Vehicles","abstract":"Internet of Vehicle (IoV) has turned into a most encouraging and fastest developing research area. This approach employs several vehicles moving on the road as an eye witness to capture the information about the incidents happening on the road. Here, two layers of cloud computing technology are used which includes Fog layer and Cloud layer. The functionality of these layers plays a vital role in the information storage, transmission process, and latency. In addition to this, rewarding of the participating users in the service is also introduced. In this proposed model, the vehicles are equipped with cameras which is then collaborate with the camera on the roadside unit to capture the images of the site around them. This information is sent to the Fog layer to store the instant information and aggregation of data is done on this layer. To encourage the user participation on the road, privacy assures rewarding system has been proposed to reward the active participating vehicle based on the contribution to the services. The participating users can also claim their reward.","authors":["Intyaz Alam","Sushil Kumar"],"meta":["January 2021Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences and Cryptography 24(4):1-13","DOI:10.1080/09720529.2020.1794516"],"references":["345444267_Pseudonym_Management_Through_Blockchain_Cost-Efficient_Privacy_Preservation_on_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems","332861348_A_Novel_and_Comprehensive_Trust_Estimation_Clustering_Based_Approach_for_Large_Scale_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","331598854_IOV_Privacy_Protection_System_Based_on_Double-Layered_Chains","315439003_A_Survey_of_Attacks_and_Detection_Mechanisms_on_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems_VANETs_and_IoV","259934145_Vehicle_Witnesses_as_a_Service_Leveraging_Vehicles_as_Witnesses_on_the_Road_in_VANET_Clouds","254018558_A_Secure_Reed-Solomon_Code_Incentive_Scheme_for_Commercial_Ad_Dissemination_Over_VANETs","220334414_Direct_Anonymous_Attestation","325748124_Secure_and_Privacy-Aware_Incentives-Based_Witness_Service_in_Social_Internet_of_Vehicles_Clouds","308729282_Covert_communication_based_privacy_preservation_in_mobile_vehicular_networks","283374647_A_Review_of_the_Digital_Tachograph_System","281576136_Engineering_Searchable_Encryption_of_Mobile_Cloud_Networks_When_QoE_Meets_QoP","262528259_An_Efficient_Merkle-Tree-Based_Authentication_Scheme_for_Smart_Grid","257769001_Securing_one-way_hash_chain_based_incentive_mechanism_for_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","224565421_Blend-In_A_Privacy-Enhancing_Certificate-Selection_Method_for_Vehicular_Communication","220213768_A_novel_secure_communication_scheme_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_network","4284225_Securing_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks"]}
