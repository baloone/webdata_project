{"id":"344924525_Smart_Urbanism_Autonomous_Vehicle_Decision-Making_Algorithms_and_Big_Data-driven_Transportation_Networks","abstract":"This article presents an empirical study carried out to evaluate and analyze autonomous vehicle decision-making algorithms and big data-driven transportation networks in smart urbanism. Building my argument by drawing on data collected from AAA, ANSYS, Atomik Research, BCG, Capgemini, Ipsos, Kennedys, Statista, and World Economic Forum, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding uses, benefits, and social implications of autonomous vehicles. Data collected from 4,800 respondents are tested against the research model by using structural equation modeling.","authors":["M.
