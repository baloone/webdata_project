{"id":"342910145_A_Study_on_Herd_Immunity_of_COVID-19_in_South_Korea_Using_a_Stochastic_Economic-Epidemiological_Model","abstract":"Vaccination is an effective measure to control the diffusion of infectious disease such as COVID-19. This paper analyzes the basic reproduction number in South Korea which enables us to identify a necessary level of vaccine stockpile to achieve herd immunity. An susceptible-infected-susceptible model is adopted that allows a stochastic diffusion. The result shows that the basic reproduction number of South Korea is approximately 2 which is substantially lower than those of the other regions. The herd immunity calculated from economic-epidemiological model suggests that at least 62% of the susceptible population be vaccinated when COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","authors":["Hojeong Park","Songhee Kim"],"meta":["August 2020Environmental and Resource Economics 76(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10640-020-00439-8"],"references":["340512166_High_Contagiousness_and_Rapid_Spread_of_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_2","340409052_Assessment_of_the_SARS-CoV-2_basic_reproduction_number_R0_based_on_the_early_phase_of_COVID-19_outbreak_in_Italy","340112783_Basic_and_effective_reproduction_numbers_of_COVID-19_cases_in_South_Korea_excluding_Sincheonji_cases","340072706_The_Estimate_of_the_Basic_Reproduction_Number_for_Novel_Coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","339272432_The_reproductive_number_of_COVID-19_is_higher_compared_to_SARS_coronavirus","338926289_Preliminary_estimation_of_the_basic_reproduction_number_of_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_in_China_from_2019_to_2020_A_data-driven_analysis_in_the_early_phase_of_the_outbreak","288906910_A_real_option_analysis_for_stochastic_disease_control_and_vaccine_stockpile_policy_An_application_to_H1N1_in_Korea"]}
