{"id":"267489189_IRSBOT-2_A_novel_two-DOF_parallel_robot_for_high-speed_operations","abstract":"This paper presents a novel two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) translational parallel robot for high-speed applications named the IRSBot-2 (acronym for IR CCyN S patial Robot with 2 DOF). Unlike most two-DOF robots dedicated to planar translational motions, this robot has two spatial kinematic chains which confers a very good intrinsic stiffness. First, the robot architecture is described. Then, its actuation and constraint singularities are analyzed. Finally, the IRSBot-2 is compared to its two-DOF counterparts based on elastostatic performances.","authors":["Coralie Germain","Sébastien Briot","Vi Ar Glasunov","Stéphane Caro"],"meta":["August 2011","DOI:10.1115/DETC2011-47564","Conference: ASME 2011 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference"],"references":["281885014_Stiffness_modelling_of_parallelogram-based_parallel_manipulators","267488821_Constraint_and_Singularity_Analysis_of_Lower-Mobility_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Parallelogram_Joints","258819938_Development_of_a_Five-Bar_Parallel_Robot_With_Large_Workspace","245387778_Kinetostatic_Design_of_an_Innovative_Schonflies-Motion_Generator","224318467_Stiffness_Analysis_of_3-dof_Overconstrained_Translational_Parallel_Manipulators","292703966_Two_novel_parallel_mechanisms_with_less_than_six_dofs_and_the_applications","281504039_Four-Degree-of-Freedom_Parallel_Robot","281420308_Two-Degree-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulator","280789838_High-Speed_Parallel_Robot_with_Four_Degrees_of_Freedom","242407562_Delta_Parallel_Robot_-_the_Story_of_Success"]}
