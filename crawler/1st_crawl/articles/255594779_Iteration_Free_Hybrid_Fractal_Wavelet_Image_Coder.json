{"id":"255594779_Iteration_Free_Hybrid_Fractal_Wavelet_Image_Coder","abstract":"Fractal image compression is a technique to store images in a small amount of space. This technique is used to compress images that contain affine redundancy, or subsections that look similar. The advantages of fractal compression are that it can be used to create very small files that decompose very quickly. The disadvantage is that it is computation intensive and time consuming as it involves pixel-to-pixel comparison between the image blocks. This paper proposes the use of wavelet transform with fractal compression that results in a much less compression time compare to the normal fractal compression method. Iteration Free Fractal Image Coding is applied to the low pass subband of wavelet transformed image and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees coding is applied to the remaining coefficients. The proposed method results in high reduction in encoding and decoding time compared to the existing methods. Copyright c","authors":["Ramyachitra Duraisamy","L.
