{"id":"343739670_Exploring_the_impact_of_video_making_on_students'_writing_skills","abstract":"Video-making projects have often been used to facilitate English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students’ active application of target language acquired in classroom settings to authentic learning environments. However, few empirical studies have focused on how the activity can foster and enhance EFL students’ writing skills. Fifty-seven EFL students participated in an 18-week study to investigate how employing different modes have enhanced their English writing skills. Data comprised (a) pre-and post-English writing tests and (b) reflective essays. Findings from the study demonstrated that students learned to be more inventive and skillful at utilizing different modes in meaning-making, as well as to be more self-regulated and conscious of diverse contexts and perspectives. Implications of the study are discussed.","authors":["Hui-Chin Yeh","Leechin Heng","Sheng Shiang Tseng"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Research on Technology in Education 53(1):1-11","DOI:10.1080/15391523.2020.1795955"],"references":["326721857_Digital_Video_Creation_in_the_LSP_Classroom","317773461_'Academic_literacies'_as_moving_beyond_writing_Investigating_multimodal_approaches_to_academic_argument","317332643_Asynchronous_group_review_of_EFL_writing_Interactions_and_text_revisions","316837373_Writing_with_21st_century_social_tools_in_the_L2_classroom_New_literacies_genres_and_writing_practices","303561037_Composing_across_modes_a_comparative_analysis_of_adolescents'_multimodal_composing_processes","301340668_The_effect_of_video_games_on_Iranian_EFL_learners'_vocabulary_learning","280232602_A_Review_of_the_Digital_Turn_in_the_New_Literacy_Studies","274476813_Multilingualism_in_written_discourse_An_approach_to_the_analysis_of_multilingual_texts","270846110_Video_Project_Assignments_and_their_Effectiveness_on_Foreign_Language_Learning","259442080_Video-Making_in_the_Foreign_Language_Classroom_Applying_Principles_of_Constructivist_Pedagogy","249738784_Writing_in_Multimodal_Texts_A_Social_Semiotic_Account_of_Designs_for_Learning","249024754_A_Multimodal_Approach_to_Academic_'Literacies'_Problematising_the_VisualVerbal_Divide","239560310_Teacher_Learning_for_New_Times_Repurposing_New_Multimodal_Literacies_and_Digital_Video_Composing_for_Schools","237079464_Composing_Kid-Friendly_Multimodal_Text","49619430_A_Power_Primer","36379423_Developing_Online_Multimodal_Verbal_Communication_to_Enhance_the_Writing_Process_in_an_Audio-Graphic_Conferencing_Environment","339484465_The_impact_of_video_and_written_feedback_on_student_preferences_of_English_speaking_practice","337727411_A_systematic_review_of_context-aware_technology_use_in_foreign_language_learning","334105499_Practicing_multiliteracies_to_enhance_EFL_learners'_meaning_making_process_and_language_development_a_multimodal_Problem-based_approach","325789091_Exploring_the_perceived_benefits_of_the_process_of_multimodal_video_making_in_developing_multiliteracies","325501855_Comparing_the_quality_of_collaborative_writing_collaborative_prewriting_and_individual_texts_in_a_Thai_EFL_context","317804538_Computer-based_multimodal_composing_activities_self-revision_and_L2_acquisition_through_writing","317387785_Openness_to_messages_about_English_as_a_foreign_language_Working_with_learners_to_uncover_purpose_to_study","316094905_Web-based_collaborative_writing_in_l2_contexts_Methodological_insights_from_text_mining","308020683_The_effects_of_pre-task_planning_on_L2_writing_Mind-mapping_and_chronological_sequencing_in_a_1st-year_German_class","305035043_Multimodal_research_Addressing_the_complexity_of_multimodal_environments_and_the_challenges_for_CALL","303819335_Best_Practices_in_L2_English_Source_Use_Pedagogy_A_Thematic_Review_and_Synthesis_of_Empirical_Studies","303326762_Teacher_Education_on_Feedback_in_EFL_Writing_Issues_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","295086455_Effect_of_teacher_modeling_and_feedback_on_EFL_students'_peer_review_skills_in_peer_review_training","294720890_Critical_perspectives_on_youth_digital_media_production_'voice'_and_representation_in_educational_contexts","292703049_Intersemiotic_complementarity_A_framework_for_multimodal_discourse_analysis","291144504_Literacy_in_the_New_Media_Age","287858205_Using_an_arts-integrated_multimodal_approach_to_promote_English_learning_A_case_study_of_two_Taiwanese_junior_college_students","286164364_Using_wikis_to_promote_collaborative_efl_writing","284113581_Implementing_Student-Produced_Video_Projects_in_Language_Courses_Guidelines_and_Lessons_Learned","281562395_Multimodal_Discourse_The_Modes_and_Media_of_Contemporary_Communication","273564001_Wiki_and_Digital_Video_Use_in_Strategic_Interaction_-_based_Experiential_EFL_Learning","259850562_Fostering_learner_autonomy_in_English_for_science_A_collaborative_digital_video_project_in_a_technological_learning_environment","256095120_Design_and_usability_testing_of_a_learning_and_plagiarism_avoidance_tutorial_system_for_paraphrasing_and_citing_in_English_A_case_study","250736489_Multimodal_Composition_in_a_College_ESL_Class_New_Tools_Traditional_Norms","249930842_Teacher_stance_as_reflected_in_feedback_on_student_writing_An_empirical_study_of_secondary_school_teachers_in_five_countries","233027334_Language_Learners_and_Multimedia_Literacy_In_and_After_School","223581683_Training_effects_on_computer-mediated_peer_review","220140617_Cell_phone_video_recording_feature_as_a_language_learning_tool_A_case_study"]}
