{"id":"342465364_Unveiling_the_implicit_knowledge_one_scenario_at_a_time","abstract":"When defining virtual reality applications with complex procedures, such as medical operations or mechanical assembly or maintenance procedures, the complexity and the variability of the procedures make the definition of the scenario difficult and time-consuming. Indeed, the variability complicates the definition of the scenario by the experts, and its combinatorics demand a comprehension effort for the developer, which is often out of reach. Additionally, the experts have a hard time explaining the procedures with a sufficient level of details, as they usually forget to mention some actions that are, in fact, important for the application. To ease the creation of scenario, we propose a complete methodology, based on (1) an iterative process composed of: (2) the recording of actions in virtual reality to create sequences of actions and (3) the use of mathematical tools that can generate a complete scenario from a few of those sequences, with (4) graphical visualization of the scenarios and complexity indicators. This process helps the expert to determine the sequences that must be recorded to obtain a scenario with the required variability.","authors":["Flavien Lécuyer","Valérie Gouranton","Aurélien Lamercerie","Adrien Reuzeau"],"meta":["October 2020The Visual Computer 36(1–2)","DOI:10.1007/s00371-020-01904-7"],"references":["281697490_Short_Paper_SEVEN_a_Sensor_Effector_Based_Scenarios_Model_for_Driving_Collaborative_Virtual_Environment","278768977_Surgical_Process_Mining_with_Test_and_Flip_Net_Synthesis","228814699_Semantic_modeling_of_virtual_environments_using_MASCARET","228668926_Formal_semantics_and_analysis_of_BPMN_process_models_using_Petri_nets","225401122_Environmental_Detectives-the_development_of_an_augmented_reality_platform_for_environmental_simulations","224169975_A_Virtual_Reality_Dance_Training_System_Using_Motion_Capture_Technology","333713414_Create_by_Doing_-_Action_Sequencing_in_VR","314815103_Automatic_orchestration_of_behaviours_through_the_management_of_resources_and_priority_levels","314721434_Learning_domain_knowledge_for_teaching_procedural_skills","276950091_The_Use_of_Immersive_Virtual_Reality_in_the_Learning_Sciences_Digital_Transformations_of_Teachers_Students_and_Social_Context","222466456_The_Synthesis_Problem_for_Elementary_Net_Systems_is_NP-Complete","221608066_Making_sense_of_virtual_environments_Action_representation_grounding_and_common_sense","221607792_Heroes_Villains_Magicians_Dramatis_Personae_in_a_Virtual_Story_Creation_Environment","221456257_Automatic_Orchestration_of_Behaviours_through_the_management_of_Resources_and_Priority_Levels","221594611_Story_Manager_in_'Europe_2045'_Uses_Petri_Nets"]}
