{"id":"328775324_Quantum-based_Subgraph_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes a new graph convolutional neural network architecture based on a depth-based representation of graph structure deriving from quantum walks, which we refer to as the quantum-based subgraph convolutional neural network (QS-CNNs). This new architecture captures both the global topological structure and the local connectivity structure within a graph. Specifically, we commence by establishing a family of K-layer expansion subgraphs for each vertex of a graph by quantum walks, which captures the global topological arrangement information for substructures contained within a graph. We then design a set of fixed-size convolution filters over the subgraphs, which helps to characterise multi-scale patterns residing in the data. The idea is to apply convolution filters sliding over the entire set of subgraphs rooted at a vertex to extract the local features analogous to the standard convolution operation on grid data. Experiments on eight graph-structured datasets demonstrate that QS-CNNs architecture is capable of outperforming fourteen state-of-the-art methods for the tasks of node classification and graph classification.","authors":["Zhihong Zhang","Chen Dongdong","Jianjia Wang","Lu Bai"],"meta":["November 2018Pattern Recognition 88","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2018.11.002"],"references":["10683743_Statistical_Evaluation_of_the_Predictive_Toxicology_Challenge_2000-2001","7782805_Protein_Function_Prediction_via_Graph_Kernels"]}
