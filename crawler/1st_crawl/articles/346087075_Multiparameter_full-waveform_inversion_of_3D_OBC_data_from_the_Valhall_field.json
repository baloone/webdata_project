{"id":"346087075_Multiparameter_full-waveform_inversion_of_3D_OBC_data_from_the_Valhall_field","abstract":"Full waveform inversion (FWI) applications on 3D ocean bottom cable (OBC) data fromthe Valhall oil field in the North Sea have demonstrated the importance of appropriately ac-counting for attenuation. The Valhall field contains unconsolidated shallow sediments anda low velocity anomaly in its center - indicative of gas clouds - which have a significantattenuation imprint on the data. The challenge in which we are interested is to performtime-domain visco-acoustic 3D FWI, which requires more sophisticated tools than in thefrequency domain wherein attenuation can be incorporated in a straightforward manner.The benefit of employing a visco-acoustic, instead of a purely acoustic, modeling engineis illustrated. We show that, in the frequency band employed (2.5 - 7.0 Hz), it is betterto reconstruct velocity only keeping attenuation fixed, because simultaneous inversion ofvelocity and quality factor Q does not provide reliable Q-updates. We design an efficienttime-domain workflow combining a random source decimation algorithm, modeling usingstandard linear solid mechanisms, and wavefield preconditioning. Our results are similarto those obtained from state-of-the-art frequency-domain algorithms, at a lower computa-tional cost compared to conventional checkpointing techniques. We clearly illustrate theimprovement in terms of imaging and data fit achieved when accounting for attenuation.","authors":["Nishant Kamath","Romain Brossier","Ludovic MÃ©tivier","Arnaud
