{"id":"325097654_Grounded_Theory_Analysis_of_Successful_Implementation_of_E-Government_Projects_Exploring_Perceptions_of_E-Government_Authorities","abstract":"This article explores the perceptions of senior managers about the successful implementations of e-government projects in their agencies, identifying what problems they have encountered and how they have addressed these problems better. 17 e-government projects were interviewed to reveal their underlying perceptions on the successful implementation of e-government projects in their agencies. After analyzing their interview transcripts, forty-nine constructs were revealed, refined, and categorized. The findings indicate that there is a lack of consensus among project managers about what constitutes e-Government project success, there was agreement across all levels of management that project success needs to be measured through a set of quantitative measures such as the number of transactions submitted through the e-government system, number of users using the system, and total time required to complete a process. Drawing from the empirical findings, this article presents a conceptual framework for change management in e-government projects together with a set of recommendations.","authors":["Ameena
