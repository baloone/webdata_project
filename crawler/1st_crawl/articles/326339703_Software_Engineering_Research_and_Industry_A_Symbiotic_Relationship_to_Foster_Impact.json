{"id":"326339703_Software_Engineering_Research_and_Industry_A_Symbiotic_Relationship_to_Foster_Impact","abstract":"Software engineering is not only an increasingly challenging endeavor that goes beyond the intellectual capabilities of any single individual engineer, but is also an intensely human one. Tools and methods to develop software are employed by engineers of varied backgrounds within a large variety of organizations and application domains. As a result, the variation in challenges and practices in system requirements, architecture, and quality assurance is staggering. Human, domain and organizational factors define the context within which software engineering methodologies and technologies are to be applied and therefore the context that research needs to account for, if it is to be impactful. This paper provides an assessment of the current challenges faced by software engineering research in achieving its potential, a description of the root causes of such challenges, and a proposal for the field to move forward and become more impactful through collaborative research and innovation between public research and industry.","authors":["Victor Basili","Lionel Briand","Domenico Bianculli","Shiva Nejati"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Software PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MS.2018.290110216"],"references":["220425327_A_decade_of_software_model_checking_with_SLAM","319993273_The_Case_for_Context-Driven_Software_Engineering_Research_Generalizability_Is_Overrated","318869527_Reflections_on_the_REST_architectural_style_and_principled_design_of_the_modern_web_architecture_impact_paper_award","303099421_Automated_test_suite_generation_for_time-continuous_simulink_models","285406788_A_Personal_Perspective_on_the_Evolution_of_Empirical_Software_Engineering","277345431_Automated_Checking_of_Conformance_to_Requirements_Templates_Using_Natural_Language_Processing","265533591_Learning_Through_Application_The_Maturing_of_the_QIP_in_the_SEL","2954141_Applying_'design_by_contract'"]}
