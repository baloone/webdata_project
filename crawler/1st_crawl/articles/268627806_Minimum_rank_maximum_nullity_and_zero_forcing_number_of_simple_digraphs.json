{"id":"268627806_Minimum_rank_maximum_nullity_and_zero_forcing_number_of_simple_digraphs","abstract":"A simple digraph describes the off-diagonal zero-nonzero pattern of a family of (not necessarily symmetric) matrices. Minimum rank of a simple digraph is the minimum rank of this family of matrices; maximum nullity is defined analogously. The simple digraph zero forcing number is an upper bound for maximum nullity. Cut-vertex reduction formulas for minimum rank and zero forcing number for simple digraphs are established. The effect of deletion of a vertex on minimum rank or zero forcing number is analyzed, and simple digraphs having very low or very high zero forcing number are characterized.","authors":["Adam Berliner","Minerva Catral","Leslie Hogben","My Huynh"],"meta":["November 2013The electronic journal of linear algebra ELA 26(1)","DOI:10.13001/1081-3810.1686"],"references":["257001029_Propagation_time_for_zero_forcing_on_a_graph","251222931_On_the_minimum_rank_of_not_necessarily_symmetric_matrices_A_preliminary_study","228667524_An_upper_bound_for_the_minimum_rank_of_a_graph","299671533_Minimum_Rank_Maximum_Nullity_and_Zero_Forcing_Number_of_Graphs","267665410_Zero_forcing_sets_and_the_minimum_rank_of_graphs","251484028_A_technique_for_computing_the_zero_forcing_number_of_a_graph_with_a_cutvertex","249957834_Computation_of_minimal_rank_and_path_cover_number_for_graphs","228979144_Vertex_and_edge_spread_of_zero_forcing_number_maximum_nullity_and_minimum_rank_of_a_graph","228570699_Minimum_rank_problems","45905415_Zero_forcing_parameters_and_minimum_rank_problems"]}
