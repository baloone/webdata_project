{"id":"304021112_Augmented_Sketch_Faster_and_More_Accurate_Stream_Processing","abstract":"Approximated algorithms are often used to estimate the frequency of items on high volume, fast data streams. The most common ones are variations of Count-Min sketch, which use sub-linear space for the count, but can produce errors in the counts of the most frequent items and can misclassify low-frequency items. In this paper, we improve the accuracy of sketch-based algorithms by increasing the frequency estimation accuracy of the most frequent items and reducing the possible misclassification of low-frequency items, while also improving the overall throughput. Our solution, called Augmented Sketch (ASketch), is based on a pre-filtering stage that dynamically identifies and aggregates the most frequent items. Items overflowing the pre-filtering stage are processed using a conventional sketch algorithm, thereby making the solution general and applicable in a wide range of contexts. The pre-filtering stage can be efficiently implemented with SIMD instructions on multi-core machines and can be further parallelized through pipeline parallelism where the filtering stage runs in one core and the sketch algorithm runs in another core.","authors":["Pratanu Roy","Arijit Khan","Gustavo Alonso"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2882903.2882948","Conference: the 2016 International Conference"],"references":["228439772_Event_Detection_in_Social_Streams","221595846_Counter_braids_a_novel_counter_architecture_for_per-flow_measurement","221559697_Space-Optimal_Heavy_Hitters_with_Strong_Error_Bounds","221214839_Holistic_UDAFs_at_streaming_speeds","221213915_Bifocal_Sampling_for_Skew-Resistant_Join_Size_Estimation","221103062_Processing_Data-Stream_Join_Aggregates_Using_Skimmed_Sketches","220964793_On_Efficient_Query_Processing_of_Stream_Counts_on_the_Cell_Processor","220907001_On_Classification_of_High-Cardinality_Data_Streams","220225191_Space-optimal_heavy_hitters_with_strong_error_bounds","51960355_gSketch_On_Query_Estimation_in_Graph_Streams","45926090_Mining_Top-K_Frequent_Itemsets_Through_Progressive_Sampling","4331065_XML_Prefiltering_as_a_String_Matching_Problem","2928009_How_to_Summarize_the_Universe_Dynamic_Maintenance_of_Quantiles","2626622_Bifocal_Sampling_for_Skew-Resistant_Join_Size_Estimation","2379360_Surfing_Wavelets_on_Streams_One-Pass_Summaries_for_Approximate_Aggregate_Queries","339504954_Data_Streams_Algorithms_and_Applications","314796652_Wavelet_synopses_with_error_guarantees","286358255_How_to_Summarize_the_Universe","271427798_Scalable_load_balancing_for_mapreduce-based_record_linkage","268239467_Sketch-based_change_detection","266538084_Duplicate_record_elimination_in_large_data_files","262293177_Synopses_for_Massive_Data_Samples_Histograms_Wavelets_Sketches","262160084_A_Prefiltering_Approach_to_Regular_Expression_Matching_for_Network_Security_Systems","260320713_Sketch_Algorithms_for_Estimating_Point_Queries_in_NLP","254463002_Efficient_frequent_item_counting_in_multi-core_hardware","254031690_The_Variable-Increment_Counting_Bloom_Filter","222823543_An_improved_data_stream_summary_The_Count-Min_Sketch_and_its_applications","222501667_The_Space_Complexity_of_Approximating_the_Frequency_Moments","222437976_Finding_repeated_elements","222415410_Frequent_items_in_streaming_data_An_experimental_evaluation_of_the_state-of-the-art","221611966_Sketch-based_Change_Detection_Methods_Evaluation_and_Applications","221322475_Efficient_Computation_of_Frequent_and_Top-k_Elements_in_Data_Streams","221310621_False_Positive_or_False_NegativeMining_Frequent_Itemsets_from_High_Speed_Transactional_Data_Streams","221213319_Wavelet_synopses_with_error_guarantees","220980239_An_Improved_Data_Stream_Summary_The_Count-Min_Sketch_and_Its_Applications","220538585_Finding_frequent_items_in_data_streams","220439417_New_directions_in_traffic_measurement_and_accounting_Focusing_on_the_elephants_ignoring_the_mice","220424808_SpaceTime_Trade-Offs_in_Hash_Coding_With_Allowable_Errors","220225456_Sketches_for_size_of_join_estimation","2921013_Sketch-based_Change_Detection_Methods_Evaluation_and_Applications","2909330_Data_Streams_Algorithms_and_Applications","2889337_Finding_Frequent_Items_in_Data_Streams","2684441_Grouping_and_Duplicate_Elimination_Benefits_of_Early_Aggregation","2538042_Processing_Complex_Aggregate_Queries_over_Data_Streams","2365725_Data-Streams_and_Histograms"]}
