{"id":"339204421_A_Model_for_Identifying_Steps_in_Undergraduate_Thesis_Methodology","abstract":"Knowledge generation is an important asset of great economic\npowers, and knowledge societies are a fundamental part in the\ndevelopment of countries. Mexico is a country that is in the process\nof development and improvement of its education system, according\nto the Educational Reform promoted since 2012 by the Federal Government.\nWe identi�ed an area of opportunity at the undergraduate\nlevel to help improve the writing of students, speci�cally in draft theses\nand research proposals. This work focuses its e�orts on analyzing with\nnatural language processing techniques the \"Methodology\" section, an\nimportant element for the development of a thesis, that helps the reader\nto understand if the techniques and data used are appropriate in an\ninvestigation. This paper proposes a Model to identify a series of steps\nin such a section. In addition, preliminary results of a basic exploration\nof a collected corpus are presented, pre-processing the text to generate\na representation according to Language Models. The corpus contains\ndocuments of graduate and undergraduate levels in the computer science\nand information technologies domain. The preliminary results showed\nthat the information extracted from the corpus serves to adequately\ndi�erentiate the methodologies of both levels.","authors":["Samuel González-López","Aurelio Lopez-Lopez","Steven Bethard","Jesús Miguel Garcia Gorrostieta"],"meta":["December 2019Research in Computing Science 148(5):17-24","DOI:10.13053/rcs-148-5-2","Project: Linguistic Analysis of Research Drafts of Undergraduate Students"],"references":["315100333_TURET20_Thesis_Writing_Tutor_Aimed_on_Lexical_Richness_in_Students'_Texts","289307955_COLECCION_DE_TESIS_Y_PROPUESTA_DE_INVESTIGACION_EN_TICS_UN_RECURSO_PARA_SU_ANALISIS_Y_ESTUDIO","259755254_Supporting_the_Review_of_Student_Proposal_Drafts_in_Information_Technologies","290105191_Using_Automated_Indices_of_Cohesion_to_Evaluate_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_and_an_Automated_Writing_Evaluation_System","265471265_Automated_essay_scoring_and_the_future_of_educational_assessment_in_medical_education","257481891_An_automatic_keyphrase_extraction_system_for_scientific_documents","220147759_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Identification_Thesis_and_Conclusion_Statements_in_Student_Essays"]}
