{"id":"280104481_Multicast_Network_Design_Game_on_a_Ring","abstract":"In this paper we study quality measures of different solution concepts for\nthe multicast network design game on a ring topology. We recall from the\nliterature a lower bound of 4/3 and prove a matching upper bound for the price\nof stability, which is the ratio of the social costs of a best Nash equilibrium\nand of a general optimum. Therefore, we answer an open question posed by\nFanelli et al. in [12]. We prove an upper bound of 2 for the ratio of the costs\nof a potential optimizer and of an optimum, provide a construction of a lower\nbound, and give a computer-assisted argument that it reaches $2$ for any\nprecision. We then turn our attention to players arriving one by one and\nplaying myopically their best response. We provide matching lower and upper\nbounds of 2 for the myopic sequential price of anarchy (achieved for a\nworst-case order of the arrival of the players). We then initiate the study of\nmyopic sequential price of stability and for the multicast game on the ring we\nconstruct a lower bound of 4/3, and provide an upper bound of 26/19. To the\nend, we conjecture and argue that the right answer is 4/3.","authors":["Akaki Mamageishvili","Matúš Mihalák"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26626-8_32","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263127041_An_H_n2_Upper_Bound_on_the_Price_of_Stability_of_Undirected_Network_Design_Games","241622643_The_curse_of_simultaneity","233387772_Improving_the_H_k-Bound_on_the_Price_of_Stability_in_UndirectedShapley_Network_Design_Games","225413174_Call_Control_in_Rings","286094567_Computing_on_an_anonymous_ring","269026253_On_the_Sequential_Price_of_Anarchy_of_Isolation_Games","262371185_The_Ring_Design_Game_with_Fair_Cost_Allocation","262311208_Improved_Bounds_on_the_Price_of_Stability_in_Network_Cost_Sharing_Games","261054435_The_Price_of_Stability_for_Undirected_Broadcast_Network_Design_with_Fair_Cost_Allocation_Is_Constant","255278740_An_Olognloglogn_upper_bound_on_the_price_of_stability_for_undirected_Shapley_network_design_games"]}
