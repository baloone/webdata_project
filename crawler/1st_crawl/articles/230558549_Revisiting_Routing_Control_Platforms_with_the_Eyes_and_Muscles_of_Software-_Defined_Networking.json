{"id":"230558549_Revisiting_Routing_Control_Platforms_with_the_Eyes_and_Muscles_of_Software-_Defined_Networking","abstract":"Prior work on centralized Routing Control Platform (RCP) has shown many benefits in flexible routing, enhanced security, and ISP connectivity management tasks. In this paper, we discuss RCPs in the context of OpenFlow/SDN, describing potential use cases and identifying deployment challenges and advantages. We propose a controller-centric hybrid networking model and present the design of the RouteFlow Control Platform (RFCP) along the prototype implementation of an AS-wide abstract BGP routing service.","authors":["Christian Esteve Rothenberg","Marcelo Ribeiro Nascimento","Marcos Rogerio Salvador","Carlos N.
