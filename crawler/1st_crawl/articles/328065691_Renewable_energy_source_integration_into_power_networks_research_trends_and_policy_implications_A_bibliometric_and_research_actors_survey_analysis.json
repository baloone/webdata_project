The main goal is to confront the contents and trends of scientific literature with the eyes and projects of researchers on future topics and issues to be solved, especially in terms of the modeling of electrical systems. The analysis relies on a bibliometric study of the Scopus database on the topic and on an online survey sent to the corresponding\nauthors of the identified papers. The paper analyzes the dynamics of publication, clusters of collaboration, and\nmain topics studied. It then identifies potential research leads, among which unresolved challenges regarding\ntechnical aspects, markets and financing issues, and social aspects. The disparity of models and results is still a necessary evil as research is not mature enough to integrate in one model all the very complex parameters of VRE integration into power systems. There is a lack of recurrence, though, such as the impact of emergent technologies\nor the development of substitute low carbon-emitting technology (other than solar and wind), need to be addressed. The paper also advocates the need for a systemic vision, for both research and policymakers that goes beyond the sole power system.","authors":["Emmanuel Hache","Angélique Palle"],"meta":["October 2018Energy Policy 124:23-35","DOI:10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.036","Project: Integration of variable renewable energy sources into power networks / Intégration des ENR variables dans le système électrique"],"references":["315343550_Building_life_cycle_assessment_research_A_review_by_bibliometric_analysis","270177213_Bibliometric_indicators_for_sustainable_hydropower_development","222822766_A_review_of_computer_tools_for_analysing_the_integration_of_renewable_energy_into_various_energy_systems","24053922_ETSAP-TIAM_the_TIMES_integrated_assessment_model_Part_I_Model_structure","346978772_Energie_economie_et_politiques","324827575_Research_on_biomass_energy_and_environment_from_the_past_to_the_future_A_bibliometric_analysis","323489505_Trends_in_global_research_in_deforestation_A_bibliometric_analysis","322916290_Modelling_perception_and_attitudes_towards_renewable_energy_technologies","322305665_A_bibliometric_analysis_on_trends_and_characters_of_carbon_emissions_from_transport_sector","318864650_Global_transition_to_low-carbon_electricity_A_bibliometric_analysis","317412465_Solar_energy_technologies_and_open_innovation_A_study_based_on_bibliometric_and_social_network_analysis","316972245_A_Bibliometric_Review_Energy_Consumption_and_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_in_the_Residential_Sector","313941712_Mapping_of_water_footprint_research_A_bibliometric_analysis_during_2006-2015","313675165_Recent_progress_on_emergy_research_A_bibliometric_analysis","311700868_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Operations_Research_and_Management_Science","309006732_Way_to_accomplish_low_carbon_development_transformation_A_bibliometric_analysis_during_1995-2014","307630307_A_bibliometric_analysis_based_review_on_wind_power_price","306090283_Assessment_on_the_research_trend_of_low-carbon_energy_technology_investment_A_bibliometric_analysis","292669659_Crowdfunding_for_renewable_and_sustainable_energy_projects_An_exploratory_case_study_approach","290789412_Chinese_energy_and_fuels_research_priorities_and_trend_A_bibliometric_analysis","290508230_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_research_on_carbon_tax_from_1989_to_2014","278666661_Three_is_a_crowd_Exploring_the_potential_of_crowdfunding_for_renewable_energy_in_the_Netherlands","266972831_Bibliometric_analysis_of_global_environmental_assessment_research_in_a_20-year_period","260042912_Review_of_software_tools_for_hybrid_renewable_energy_systems","254418826_European_climate_--_energy_security_nexus_A_model_based_scenario_analysis","242686300_Documentation_for_the_TIMES_model","223897853_Modelling_energy_demand_of_developing_countries_Are_the_specific_features_adequately_captured"]}
