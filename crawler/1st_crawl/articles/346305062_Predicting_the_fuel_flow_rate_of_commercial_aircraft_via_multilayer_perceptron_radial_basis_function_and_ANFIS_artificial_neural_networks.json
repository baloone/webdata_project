The training of the architectures with a single hidden layer is performed by utilising the Delta-Bar-Delta (DBD), Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Quickprop (QP) algorithms. The optimum network topologies are sought by varying the number of processing elements in the hidden layer of the networks using a trial-and-error method. An evaluation of the approximate fuel intake values against the ideal fuel intake data from the FDRs indicates a good fit for all three ANN models. Thus, more accurate fuel intake estimations can be obtained by applying the RBF-ANN model during the climb and descent flight stages, whereas the MLP-ANN model is more effective for the cruise phase. The best accuracy obtained in terms of the linear correlation coefficient is 0.99988, 0.91946 and 0.95252 for the climb, cruise and descent phase, respectively.","authors":["T.
