{"id":"323377956_Numerical_integration_using_integrals_over_hyperplane_sections_of_simplices_in_a_triangulation_of_a_polytope","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating a definite integral of\na given function f when, rather than its values at some points, a number of\nintegrals of f over some hyperplane sections of simplices in a triangulation of a\npolytope P in Rd are only available. We present several families of integration\nformulas, all of which are a weighted sum of integrals over some hyperplane sections\nof simplices, and which contain in a special case of our result multivariate\nanalogues of the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. Along\nwith an efficient algorithm for its implementation, several illustrative numerical\nexamples are provided comparing these cubature formulas among themselves.\nThe paper also presents the best possible explicit constants for their approximation\nerrors. Finally, we will discuss a conjecture suggested by the numerical\nresults.","authors":["Guessab Allal","Boris Semisalov"],"meta":["March 2018BIT.
