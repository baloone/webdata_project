{"id":"335083093_A_high-speed_interval_type_2_fuzzy_system_approach_for_dynamic_parameter_adaptation_in_metaheuristics","abstract":"Fuzzy dynamic adaptation of parameters in meta-heuristic algorithms has recently been shown to provide an improvement in efficiency with respect to meta-heuristic algorithms with static parameters. However, executing a fuzzy inference in each iteration represents an increase in the computational cost, and this is even more critical in the case of using Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems. On the other hand, fuzzy dynamic adaptation with Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has shown better performance when compared with respect to Type-1 Fuzzy Logic in diverse areas of application; therefore, the goal of this paper is aimed at reducing the computational cost of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic processing for dynamic adaptation of parameters in meta-heuristic algorithms. To reduce the computational cost of processing the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy system for dynamic adaptation of metaheuristic parameters, the use of an approximation to the Continuous Karnikâ€“Mendel method (CEKM) is proposed. The proposed approach provides an analytical approximation to the CEKM method, in this way reducing the computational cost of evaluating the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy System. The performance of the proposed approach was tested with five benchmark functions and with one benchmark control problem. The proposed approach was tested with two different meta-heuristic algorithms, the Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) and the Harmony Search algorithm (HS), in both cases achieving a reduction in the computational cost, while maintaining the performance with respect to the Type-2 Dynamic adaptation of parameters with the conventional type reduction methods.","authors":["Oscar Castillo","Patricia Melin","Emanuel Ontiveros","Patricia Ochoa"],"meta":["October 2019Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 85(2):666","DOI:10.1016/j.engappai.2019.07.020"],"references":["353433736_Optimization_of_Intelligent_Controllers_Using_a_Type-1_and_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","318218735_New_Methodology_to_Approximate_Type-Reduction_Based_on_a_Continuous_Root-Finding_Karnik_Mendel_Algorithm","309164287_A_New_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Dynamic_Parameter_Adaptation","308572572_A_new_fuzzy_bee_colony_optimization_with_dynamic_adaptation_of_parameters_using_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_for_tuning_fuzzy_controllers","271548421_On_the_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_control_of_ball_and_plate_system","227242104_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_Global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","226963067_Hybrid_Metaheuristics_An_Introduction","226711844_Metaheuristics_Intelligent_Problem_Solving","220164617_A_New_Heuristic_Optimization_Algorithm_Harmony_Search","3336040_Type-2_Fuzzy_Sets_Made_Simple","3335914_Interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems_Theory_and_design","3335858_Type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems","320132972_Study_on_the_Use_of_Type-1_and_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Systems_Applied_to_Benchmark_Functions_Using_the_Fuzzy_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","320132800_A_New_Approach_for_Dynamic_Mutation_Parameter_in_the_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm_Using_Fuzzy_Logic","312153237_Differential_evolution","311555378_Differential_Evolution_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_and_a_Comparative_Study_with_Other_Metaheuristics","311555341_Imperialist_Competitive_Algorithm_with_Dynamic_Parameter_Adaptation_Applied_to_the_Optimization_of_Mathematical_Functions","311254701_QUasi-affine_TRansformation_Evolutionary_QUATRE_algorithm_A_parameter-reduced_differential_evolution_algorithm_for_optimization_problems","307738418_Linear_approximation_of_Karnik-Mendel_type_reduction_algorithm","306528941_Improving_the_Speed_of_Center_of_Set_Type-Reduction_in_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Systems_by_Eliminating_the_Need_for_Sorting","304457042_Recurrent_interval_type-2_neuro-fuzzy_control_of_an_electro_hydraulic_servo_system","300116943_Differential_Evolution_with_Fuzzy_Logic_for_Dynamic_Adaptation_of_Parameters_in_Mathematical_Function_Optimization","297603712_Optimization_of_fuzzy_controller_design_using_a_new_bee_colony_algorithm_with_fuzzy_dynamic_parameter_adaptation","282240440_A_Survey_of_Metaheuristics_Methods_for_Bioinformatics_Applications","278711725_A_Survey_of_Continuous_Karnik-Mendel_Algorithms_and_Their_Generalizations","225756855_State-of-_The-Art_in_the_Structure_of_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","225462970_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Applications","224329849_Towards_an_efficient_type-reduction_method_for_interval_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems","224274382_Type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems_type-reduction","224225467_Connect_Karnik-Mendel_Algorithms_to_Root-Finding_for_Computing_the_Centroid_of_an_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set","220313384_Centroid_of_a_type-2_fuzzy_set"]}
