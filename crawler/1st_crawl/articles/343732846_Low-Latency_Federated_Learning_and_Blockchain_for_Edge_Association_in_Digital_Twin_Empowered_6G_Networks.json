{"id":"343732846_Low-Latency_Federated_Learning_and_Blockchain_for_Edge_Association_in_Digital_Twin_Empowered_6G_Networks","abstract":"Emerging technologies such as digital twins and 6th Generation mobile networks (6G) have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels and limited resources hinder its application in IIoT. In this paper, we introduce Digital Twin Wireless Networks (DTWN) to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing. To balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning method.","authors":["Yunlong Lu","Xiaohong Huang","Ke Zhang","Sabita Maharjan"],"meta":["August 2020IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2020.3017668"],"references":["339245948_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Permissioned_Blockchain_for_Content_Caching_in_Vehicular_Edge_Computing_and_Networks","331656308_Adaptive_Federated_Learning_in_Resource_Constrained_Edge_Computing_Systems","316334361_The_Digital_Twin_Realizing_the_Cyber-Physical_Production_System_for_Industry_40","287250882_Distributed_Optimization_with_Arbitrary_Local_Solvers","345078627_Digital_Twin_in_Industry_State-of-the-Art","341954637_Blockchain-assisted_access_for_federated_Smart_Grid_domains_Coupling_and_features","340800382_Fuzzy_Inference_Enabled_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning-Based_Traffic_Light_Control_for_Intelligent_Transportation_System","340535110_Federated_Learning_in_Mobile_Edge_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Survey","339245058_Blockchain_Empowered_Asynchronous_Federated_Learning_for_Secure_Data_Sharing_in_Internet_of_Vehicles","338810392_What_should_6G_be","336402465_Edge_Intelligence_and_Blockchain_Empowered_5G_Beyond_for_the_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","335900720_Blockchain_and_Federated_Learning_for_Privacy-Preserved_Data_Sharing_in_Industrial_IoT","333848036_Federated_Learning_over_Wireless_Networks_Optimization_Model_Design_and_Analysis","331505851_Artificial_Intelligence-Driven_Mechanism_for_Edge_Computing-Based_Industrial_Applications","331269719_Federated_Learning_Based_Proactive_Content_Caching_in_Edge_Computing","327853035_Artificial_Intelligence_Inspired_Transmission_Scheduling_in_Cognitive_Vehicular_Communications_and_Networks","325339045_Digital_twin_driven_prognostics_and_health_management_for_complex_equipment","317486066_Semi-supervised_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Support_of_IoT_and_Smart_City_Services","317399486_Multi-Agent_Actor-Critic_for_Mixed_Cooperative-Competitive_Environments","317244811_Experimentable_digital_twins_for_model-based_systems_engineering_and_simulation-based_development","317241158_Federated_Multi-Task_Learning","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","4772034_Non-Gaussian_OU_Based_Models_and_Some_of_Their_Uses_in_Financial_Economics"]}
