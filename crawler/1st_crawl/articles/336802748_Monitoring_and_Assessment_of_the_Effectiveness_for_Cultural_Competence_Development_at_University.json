It considers various interpretations of the concept of “cultural competence”, its componential criteria to assess students’ progress through their studying. The literature review revealed the redundancy of interpretations that can be explained by multiculturality of the concept as well as the lack of information, concerning assessment tools for the cultural competence monitoring. As a result of sifting and practical testing of a number of methods, the development of proprietary methodology eligible for the competencybased approach in the multi-level system of education is represented here. This study is intended to suggest compact and less time-consuming methods approbated by educators among the students of the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Tyumen, Russia.","authors":["Natalia Vojtik","Sofia Panarina","Ludmila Melnikova"],"meta":["January 2019SHS Web of Conferences 69(1):00127","DOI:10.1051/shsconf/20196900127"],"references":["237118487_Inspiring_Others_The_Language_of_Leadership","341690965_Syntactic_Structures","309261101_Technological_platform_for_realization_of_students'_individual_educational_trajectories_in_a_vocational_school","9723492_Motivation_Reconsidered_The_Concept_Of_Competence"]}
