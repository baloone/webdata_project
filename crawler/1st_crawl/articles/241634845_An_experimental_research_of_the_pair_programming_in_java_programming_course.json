{"id":"241634845_An_experimental_research_of_the_pair_programming_in_java_programming_course","abstract":"In recent years, as a process improvement strategy for learning programming skills, pair programming is increasingly used in research and practice in the field of computer teaching. This paper conducts teaching experiment by applying pair programming to teach Java programming course at the Chongqing Technology and Business University (China). The experiment results show that most students involved in the pair programming agree to use it for the following benefits: (i) improvement of the learning self-confidence, (ii) higher quality of the experiment finished. This research validates the previous research of pair programming, and demonstrates that better teaching effects will be achieved if this technology is used in the teaching programming course.","authors":["Lai Han","Wenjuan Xin"],"meta":["December 2011","DOI:10.1109/ICeEEM.2011.6137800"],"references":["228951124_In_Support_of_Pair_Programming_in_the_Introductory_Computer_Science_Course","224631033_Pair_Programming_in_Graduate_Software_Engineering_Course_Projects","220422564_Pair_programming_improves_student_retention_confidence_and_program_quality","220069353_Empirical_Studies_of_Pair_Programming_for_CSSE_Teaching_in_Higher_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","2333697_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Pair_Programming","262363578_All_I_really_need_to_know_about_pair_programming_I_learned_in_kindergarten","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","220926020_Examining_the_Compatibility_of_Student_Pair_Programmers","3841123_The_effects_of_pair-pressure_and_pair-learning_on_software_engineering_education","3247643_Strengthening_the_Case_for_Pair-Programming"]}
