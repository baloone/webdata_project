{"id":"232497075_Perceptual_centers_P-Centers","abstract":"Words presented with regular acoustic onsets are not perceptually regular. The requirements for perceived regularity were investigated, and the perceptual center (P-center) of a word was defined as its psychological moment of occurrence. Some properties of these perceptual centers have been empirically determined, and the range of their applicability is sketched. In particular, it is already clear that temporal alignment of P-centers is a relevant variable in dichotic presentation of speech.
