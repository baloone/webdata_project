{"id":"314416552_Program_Factory_-_A_Conception_of_Knowledge_Representation_of_Scientific_Artifacts_from_Standpoint_of_Software_Engineering","abstract":"The factory of the programs is created by students of the cybernetics department at KNU. A primary objective of this factory is the electronic presentation of the “Software engineering” textbook, created based on international programs “Curricula-2001” and intended for mastering of this discipline by students and acquiring knowledge on these fundamental aspects. It is used for implementation by the students of laboratorials, diplomas and master’s works. Their algorithms and programs are developed at technological lines (TL) with the specifications in various programming languages (C#, Pascal, etc), WSDL, IDL and saved in repository for the prepared program products (artifacts and programs). Factory helps to study the textbook and create products that can be used by the other students at different universities from ready reusable components in the MS.NET system.","authors":["Lavrischeva K.","Aronov A.","Dzyubenko A."],"meta":["May 2013Computer and Information Science 6(3)","DOI:10.5539/cis.v6n3p21"],"references":["302359932_Software_Engineering_on_the_Web","290749833_Approach_to_e-learning_fundamental_aspects_of_software_engineering","257543946_Theory_and_practice_of_software_factories","247571886_Software_Factories_Assembling_Applications_with_Patterns","234814898_Toward_a_tradition_of_software_engineering","227039196_Classification_of_software_engineering_disciplines","213882667_Generative_Programming_Methods_Tools_and_Applications"]}
