{"id":"331884936_Bio-Curation_for_Cellular_Signalling_The_KAMI_Project","abstract":"The general question of what constitutes bio-curation for rule-based modelling of cellular signalling is posed. A general approach to the problem is presented, based on rewriting in hierarchies of graphs, together with a specific instantiation of the methodology that addresses our particular bio-curation problem. The current state of the ongoing development of the KAMI bio-curation tool, based on this approach, is outlined along with our plans for future development.","authors":["Russell Harmer","Yves-Stan Le Cornec","Sébastien Légaré","Eugenia Oshurko"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCBB.2019.2906164"],"references":["321290965_From_word_models_to_executable_models_of_signaling_networks_using_automated_assembly","296619431_A_knowledge_representation_meta-model_for_rule-based_modelling_of_signalling_networks","280221896_DARPA's_Big_Mechanism_program","280062312_BioNetGen_22_Advances_in_Rule-Based_Modeling","266215661_Introduction_to_Trace_Theory","259457124_Perturbation_Biology_Inferring_Signaling_Networks_in_Cellular_Systems","223989642_Drug_development_raise_standards_for_preclinical_cancer_research_Nature_4837391531-533_Epub_20120331","220713448_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_-_Part_II_Single_Pushout_Approach_and_Comparison_with_Double_Pushout_Approach","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","220700422_Rule-Based_Modeling_of_Cellular_Signaling_Concurrency_Theory","220687785_Rule-Based_Modelling_and_Model_Perturbation","23232374_Models_from_experiments_Combinatorial_drug_perturbations_of_cancer_cells","7431194_A_Systems_Model_of_Signaling_Identifies_a_Molecular_Basis_Set_for_Cytokine-Induced_Apoptosis","2777413_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_Part_I_Basic_Concepts_and_Double_Pushout_Approach","319408676_Bio-Curation_for_Cellular_Signalling_The_KAMI_Project","294258548_Widespread_Expansion_of_Protein_Interaction_Capabilities_by_Alternative_Splicing","288802473_Graphs_rewriting_and_pathway_reconstruction_for_rule-based_models","242982550_Exponentiable_morphisms_partial_products_and_pullback_complements","229422909_The_BioPAX_community_standard_for_pathway_data_sharing","220486638_Rule-based_Modelling_and_Tunable_Resolution","51618534_Prinz_F_Schlange_T_Asadullah_K_Believe_it_or_not_how_much_can_we_rely_on_published_data_on_potential_drug_targets_Nat_Rev_Drug_Discov_10_712","12791443_1998_Warkany_Lecture_Signaling_pathways_in_development"]}
