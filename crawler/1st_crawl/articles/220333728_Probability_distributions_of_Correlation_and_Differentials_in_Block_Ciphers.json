{"id":"220333728_Probability_distributions_of_Correlation_and_Differentials_in_Block_Ciphers","abstract":"We study the probability distributions of difference propagation probabilities and input-output\ncorrelations for functions and block ciphers of given dimensions, for several of them for the\nfirst time. We show that these parameters have distributions that are well-studied in the field of\nprobability such as the normal, Poisson and extreme value distributions. The results of this paper\ncan be used to estimate how much effort will be required to generate functions satisfying certain\ncriteria. The distributions we derive for block ciphers illustrate the significant difference between\nfixed-key parameters and averaged parameters.","authors":["Joan Daemen","Vincent Rijmen"],"meta":["January 2005Journal of Mathematical Cryptology 2005(3):212","DOI:10.1515/JMC.2007.011","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226672956_On_the_Distribution_of_Characteristics_in_Bijective_Mappings","285649884_Maximum_non-averaged_differential_probability","285332458_Differential-Linear_Cryptanalysis","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","267180794_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory","239656279_Strict_Evaluation_of_the_Maximum_Average_of_Differential_Probability_and_the_Maximum_Average_of_Linear_Probability","235720528_AES_the_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","228057717_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_II","227036208_On_the_distribution_of_characteristics_in_bijective_mappings","226173374_Shamir_A_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems_Journal_of_Cryptology_41_3-72"]}
