{"id":"308740278_Quantum_MDS_codes_with_relatively_large_minimum_distance_from_Hermitian_self-orthogonal_codes","abstract":"It has become common knowledge that constructing q-ary quantum MDS codes with minimum distance bigger than \\(q/2+1\\) is significantly more difficult than constructing those with minimum distance less than or equal to \\(q/2+1\\). Despite of various constructions of q-ary quantum MDS codes, all known q-ary quantum MDS codes have minimum distance bounded by \\(q/2+1\\) except for some lengths. The purpose of the current paper is to provide some new q-ary quantum MDS codes with minimum distance bigger than \\(q/2+1\\). In this paper, we provide several classes of quantum MDS codes with minimum distance bigger than \\(q/2+1\\). For instance, some examples in these classes include q-ary \\([n,n-2k, k+1]\\)-quantum MDS codes for cases: (i) \\(q\\equiv -1\\bmod {5}, n=(q^2+4)/5\\) and \\(1\\le k\\le (3q-2)/5\\); (ii) \\(q\\equiv -1\\bmod {7}, n=(q^2+6)/7\\) and \\(1\\le k\\le (4q-3)/7\\); (iii) \\(2|q, q\\equiv -1\\bmod {3}, n=2(q^2-1)/3\\) and \\(1\\le k\\le (2q-1)/3\\); and (iv) \\(2|q, q\\equiv -1\\bmod {5}, n=2(q^2-1)/5\\) and \\(1\\le k\\le (3q-2)/5\\).","authors":["Lingfei Jin","Haibin Kan","Jie Wen"],"meta":["September 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 84(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0281-9"],"references":["260715806_Application_of_Constacyclic_Codes_to_Quantum_MDS_Codes","258442171_A_construction_of_new_quantum_MDS_codes","344904244_Coding_Theory_A_First_Course","281195957_Some_New_Classes_of_Quantum_MDS_Codes_from_Constacyclic_Codes","277161463_Quantum_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes_Unified_framework_for_quantum_MDS_codes","267166888_Measure_theory_A_first_course","267117217_New_quantum_MDS_codes","262526151_New_quantum_MDS_codes_derived_from_constacyclic_codes","260800486_Constacyclic_Codes_and_Some_New_Quantum_MDS_Codes","260542013_New_Quantum_MDS_Codes_From_Negacyclic_Codes","258424181_Quantum_Stabilizer_Codes_From_Maximal_Curves","224168139_Application_of_Classical_Hermitian_Self-Orthogonal_MDS_Codes_to_Quantum_MDS_Codes","252687442_Construction_of_nn-43q_quantum_codes_for_odd_prime_power_q","224754158_On_quantum_MDS_codes","224249286_New_quantum_MDS_codes"]}
