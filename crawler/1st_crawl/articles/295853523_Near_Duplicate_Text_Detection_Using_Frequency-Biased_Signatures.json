{"id":"295853523_Near_Duplicate_Text_Detection_Using_Frequency-Biased_Signatures","abstract":"As the use of electronic documents are becoming more popular, people want to find documents completely or partially duplicate. In this paper, we propose a near duplicate text detection framework using signatures to save space and query time. We also propose a novel signature selection algorithm which uses collection frequency of q-grams. We compare our algorithm with Winnowing, which is one of the state-of-the-art signature selection algorithms. We show that our algorithm acquires much better accuracy with less time and space cost. We perform extensive experiments to verify our conclusion.","authors":["Yifang Sun","Jianbin Qin","Yi Wang"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-41230-1_24","Conference: International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering"],"references":["262322555_HmSearch_An_efficient_hamming_distance_query_processing_algorithm","242293556_Overview_of_the_1st_International_Competition_on_Plagiarism_Detection","224500298_Variable-Stride_Multi-Pattern_Matching_For_Scalable_Deep_Packet_Inspection","316928083_Copy_Detection_Mechanisms_for_Digital_Documents","312944129_Detecting_the_Origin_of_Text_Segments_Efficiently","309456867_Efficient_similarity_joins_for_near_duplicate_detection","291586658_Duplicate_News_Story_Detection_Revisited","279760304_Similarity_estimation_techniques_from_rounding_algorithms","254464498_Learning_hash_codes_for_efficient_content_reuse_detection","234825122_Copy_detection_mechanisms_for_digital_documents"]}
