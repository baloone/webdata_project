{"id":"302469019_Supervised_Sequence_Labelling","abstract":"This chapter provides the background material and literature review for supervised sequence labelling. Section 2.1 briefly reviews supervised learning in general. Section 2.2 covers the classical, non-sequential framework of supervised pattern classification. Section 2.3 defines supervised sequence labelling, and describes the different classes of sequence labelling task that arise under different assumptions about the label sequences.","authors":["Alex Graves"],"meta":["February 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2_2","In book: Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks (pp.5-13)"],"references":[]}
