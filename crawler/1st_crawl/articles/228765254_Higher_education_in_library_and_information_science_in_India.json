INTRODUCTION Since dawn of civilization man has been striving to know the unknown. On the long voyage of exploration of unknown man has collected innumerable pearls and pebbles and tried to preserve those, undoubtedly a very fundamental attitude of mankind that initiated the concept of preservation of thought contents or knowledge and gave rise to the concept of library later on. The Vedas for instance have been passed from generation to generation through oral tradition, known as Shruti and Smriti, i.e. to listen and to retain. Side by side, we had also the tradition of preserving manuscripts at places like temples, dargahs (tombs and shrines), madrasas, mosques and tols (schools). The tradition continued during the Middle Ages. So, 'librarianship' in the sense of collecting and preserving books and manuscripts has existed in India since time immemorial, but only in the early part of the twentieth century it began to be treated as a distinct field of specialisation with its own principles, techniques, theories and practices.","authors":["Bidyarthi Dutta","Anup Kumar Das"],"meta":["January 2001"],"references":[]}
