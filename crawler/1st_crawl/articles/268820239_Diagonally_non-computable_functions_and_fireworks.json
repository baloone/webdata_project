{"id":"268820239_Diagonally_non-computable_functions_and_fireworks","abstract":"A set C of reals is said to be negligible if there is no probabilistic\nalgorithm which generates a member of C with positive probability. Various\nclasses have been proven to be negligible, for example the Turing upper-cone of\na non-computable real, the class of coherent completions of Peano Arithmetic or\nthe class of reals of minimal degrees. One class of particular interest in the\nstudy of negligibility is the class of diagonally non-computable (DNC)\nfunctions, proven by Kucera to be non-negligible in a strong sense: every\nMartin-L\\\"of random real computes a DNC function. Ambos-Spies et al. showed\nthat the converse does not hold: there are DNC functions which compute no\nMartin-L\\\"of random real. In this paper, we show that such the set of such DNC\nfunctions is in fact non-negligible. More precisely, we prove that for every\nsufficiently fast-growing computable~$h$, every 2-random real computes an\n$h$-bounded DNC function which computes no Martin-L\\\"of random real. Further,\nwe show that the same holds for the set of reals which compute a DNC function\nbut no bounded DNC function. The proofs of these results use a combination of a\ntechnique due to Kautz (which, following a metaphor of Shen, we like to call a\n`fireworks argument') and bushy tree forcing, which is the canonical forcing\nnotion used in the study of DNC functions.","authors":["Laurent Bienvenu","Ludovic Patey"],"meta":["November 2014Information and Computation 253(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2016.12.008","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264994761_1_Algorithmic_Randomness_and_Complexity","259764483_Comparing_the_strength_of_diagonally_non-recursive_functions_in_the_absence_of_Sigma0_2_induction","251192505_Measure_P_1_0_-classes_and_complete_extensions_of_PA","236635330_Probabilistic_Constructions_of_Computable_Objects_and_a_Computable_Version_of_Lov'asz_Local_Lemma","225114392_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_the_Recursion_Theorem","51951980_The_typical_Turing_degree","312410976_Algebra_of_Invariant_Attributes_of_Binary_Sequence","305147501_Computability_algorithmic_randomness_and_complexity","274403757_Forcing_with_Bushy_Trees","268531256_Algebra_of_invariant_properties_of_binary_sequences","267093584_A_fixed-point-free_minimal_degree","258230006_Shift-complex_sequences","256112323_Measure_and_minimal_degrees","254212021_Mass_problems_associated_with_effectively_closed_sets","252163589_Diagonally_non-recursive_functions_and_effective_Hausdorff_dimension","247665510_0_1_Classes_and_Degrees_of_Theories","242359290_Computability_by_Probabilistic_Machines","239666681_Degrees_of_random_sets","237131726_Remarks_on_the_structure_of_tt-degrees_based_on_constructive_measure_theory","225530601_Invariant_properties_of_informational_bulks","220994473_Everywhere_complex_sequences_and_the_probabilistic_method","220976544_Invariant_Properties_of_Informational_Bulks","50274460_Everywhere_complex_sequences_and_probabilistic_method","38338873_Comparing_DNR_and_WWKL","38338866_Almost_everywhere_domination"]}
