{"id":"278717601_Scheduling_Unrelated_Parallel_Machines_with_Sequence_Dependent_Setup_Times_and_Weighted_Earliness-Tardiness_Minimization","abstract":"This work deals with the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with machine and job-sequence dependent setup times. The studied objective is the minimization of the total weighted earliness and tardiness. We study existing Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) mathematical formulations. A genetic algorithm is proposed, which includes a procedure for inserting idle times in the production sequence in order to improve the objective value. We also present a benchmark of small and large instances to carry out the computational experiments. After an exhaustive computational and statistical analysis, the conclusion is that the proposed method shows a good performance.","authors":["Eva Vallada","Rub√©n Ruiz"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-1123-9_4","In book: Just-in-Time Systems (pp.67-90)"],"references":["313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","281128473_Exponential_neighborhood_search_for_a_parallel_machine_scheduling_problem","275346413_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiments","266385157_Design_Analysis_of_Experiments","265459019_Parallel_machine_scheduling_problems_A_survey","263066037_A_genetic_algorithm_for_flow_shop_scheduling_problems","261652720_Heuristic_scheduling_of_parallel_machines_with_sequence-dependent_set-up_times","261632562_Minimizing_the_sum_of_job_earliness_and_tardiness_in_a_multimachine_system","261587681_Simulated_annealing_for_parallel_machine_scheduling_with_earliness-tardiness_penalties_and_sequence-dependent_set-up_times"]}
