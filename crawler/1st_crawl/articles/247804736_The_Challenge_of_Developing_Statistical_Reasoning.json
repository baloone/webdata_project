{"id":"247804736_The_Challenge_of_Developing_Statistical_Reasoning","abstract":"This paper defines statistical reasoning and reviews research on this topic. Types of correct and incorrect reasoning are summarized, and statistical reasoning about sampling distributions is examined in more detail. A model of statistical reasoning is presented, and suggestions are offered for assessing statistical reasoning. The paper concludes with implications for teaching students in ways that will facilitate the development of their statistical reasoning.","authors":["Joan Garfield"],"meta":["November 2002Journal of Statistics Education 10(3)","DOI:10.1080/10691898.2002.11910676"],"references":["280385231_An_Activity-Based_Statistics_Course","256096385_A_model_of_classroom_research_in_action_Developing_simulation_activities_to_improve_students'_statistical_reasoning","247700710_Teaching_and_assessing_statistical_reasoning","233470347_Informal_Conceptions_of_Probability","226075396_Cognitive_models_and_problem_spaces_in_purely_random_situations","225767723_A_framework_for_assessing_middle_school_students'_thinking_in_conditional_probability_and_independence","344613433_Improving_Statistical_Reasoning_Theoretical_Models_and_Practical_Implications","306173475_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","275848747_The_Assessment_Challenge_in_Statistics_Education","271814076_Difficulties_in_Learning_Basic_Concepts_in_Probability_and_Statistics_Implications_for_Research","268619375_Activity-based_statistics_Instructor_resources_Revised_by_Tim_Erickson_2nd_revised_ed","266006416_Workshop_statistics_Discovery_with_data_2nd_ed","256096544_Reasoning_about_sampling_distributions","254330390_The_Planning_Stage_in_Statistical_Reasoning","246438156_Improving_Statistical_Reasoning_Theoretical_Models_and_Practical_Implications","245635225_Challenges_in_assessing_statistical_reasoning","245508482_Assessment_in_Statistics_Education_Issues_and_Challenges","241735458_A_Framework_for_the_Development_of_Measurement_Instruments_for_Evaluating_the_Introductory_Statistics_Course","238160360_A_framework_for_assessing_and_nurturing_young_children''s_thinking_in_probability","222464245_The_Case_for_Rules_in_Reasoning","2543847_A_Collaborative_Convergence_on_Studying_Reasoning_Processes_A_Case_Study_in_Statistics"]}
