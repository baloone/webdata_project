{"id":"313609486_A_new_approach_to_teaching_a_first_course_in_Compiler_Construction","abstract":"A new approach to teaching a first course in compiler construction is presented, in which the traditional term project is replaced by several smaller, independent, programming assignments. Each assignment is a compiler for a simple language using a different parsing technique. A means is described to augment the programming assignments, so that a greater variety of experiences is provided students. A short review of the literature is included.","authors":["H.D.
