A team of over thirty STEM education professionals from across the U.S. collaborated on the important work of mapping out the Common Core standards in mathematics and English/language arts, the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations, and the Framework for 21st Century Learning into a coordinated, integrated, STEM education curriculum map. The book is structured in three main parts-Conceptualizing STEM, STEM Curriculum Maps, and Building Capacity for STEM-designed to build common understandings of integrated STEM, provide rich curriculum maps for implementing integrated STEM at the classroom level, and supports to enable systemic transformation to an integrated STEM approach. The STEM Road Mapplaces the power into educators' hands to implement integrated STEM learning within their classrooms without the need for extensive resources, making it a reality for all students.","authors":["Carla C.
