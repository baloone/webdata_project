{"id":"263390470_Reachability_Analysis_of_Quantum_Markov_Decision_Processes","abstract":"We introduce the notion of quantum Markov decision process (qMDP) as a\nsemantic model of nondeterministic and concurrent quantum programs. It is shown\nby examples that qMDPs can be used in analysis of quantum algorithms and\nprotocols. We study various reachability problems of qMDPs both for the\nfinite-horizon and for the infinite-horizon. The (un)decidability and\ncomplexity of these problems are settled, or their relationships with certain\nlong-standing open problems are clarified. We also develop an algorithm for\nfinding optimal scheduler that attains the supremum reachability probability.","authors":["Shenggang Ying","Mingsheng Ying"],"meta":["June 2014Information and Computation 263","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2018.09.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["251165606_Absolute_Asymptotic_Stability_of_Discrete_Linear_Inclusions","237077133_Reachability_Probabilities_of_Quantum_Markov_Chains","281267950_The_Lyapunov_exponent_and_joint_spectral_radius_of_pairs_of_matrices_are_hard_-_When_not_impossible_-_To_compute_and_to_approximate","262254044_Tabular_A_Schema-Driven_Probabilistic_Programming_Language","246546655_Quipper_A_Scalable_Quantum_Programming_Language","243964127_Quantum_algorithms_for_supervised_and_unsupervised_machine_learning","239059858_A_Note_on_the_Joint_Spectral_Radius","235001096_Procedural_Quantum_Programming","228394844_Non-deterministic_quantum_programming","226317522_Quantum_Programming"]}
