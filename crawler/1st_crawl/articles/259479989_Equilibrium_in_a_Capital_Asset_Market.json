{"id":"259479989_Equilibrium_in_a_Capital_Asset_Market","abstract":"This paper investigates the properties of a market for risky assets on the basis of a simple model of general equilibrium of exchange, where individual investors seek to maximize preference functions over expected yield and variance of yield on their port- folios. A theory of market risk premiums is outlined, and it is shown that general equilibrium implies the existence of a so-called \"market line,\" relating per dollar expected yield and standard deviation of yield. The concept of price of risk is discussed in terms of the slope of this line.","authors":["Jan Mossin"],"meta":["October 1966Econometrica 34(4):768â€“83","DOI:10.2307/1910098"],"references":["270444309_L'Extension_des_Theories_de_l'Equilibre_Economique_General_et_du_Rendement_Social_au_Cas_du_Risque","243660844_The_Role_of_Securities_in_the_Optimal_Allocation_of_Risk_Bearing","239059651_Equilibrium_in_Reinsurance_Market","235926747_Capital_Asset_Prices_A_Theory_of_Market_Equilibrium_Under_Conditions_of_Risk","4859267_Liquidity_Preference_As_Behavior_Toward_Risk"]}
