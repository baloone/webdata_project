{"id":"324905293_The_City_Shaped_The_Grid","abstract":"This chapter is an abridged version of Spiro Kostof’s chapter on “The Grid,” which was originally published in the author’s landmark book, The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History (1991). Kostof’s account of the grid layout has had a significant influence on subsequent scholarship related to the historical geography of the grid. The excerpts reprinted in this chapter highlight Kostof’s key contributions with a focus on the relation between the grid and political ideology.","authors":["Spiro Kostof"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-76490-0_4","In book: Gridded Worlds: An Urban Anthology (pp.55-73)"],"references":["321371578_Parallelism_and_disjunction_a_study_in_the_internal_structure_of_Welsh_towns","284207544_The_Ancient_City_of_Suzhou_Town_Planning_in_the_Sung_Dynasty","274790678_Maps_in_the_Treatises_of_Roman_Land_Surveyors","270294891_Florentine_New_Towns_Urban_Design_in_the_Late_Middle_Ages","270211421_Florentine_New_Towns_Urban_Design_in_the_Late_Middle_Ages","243681599_Future_Development_in_Western_Europe","238254201_Japan_From_Prehistory_to_Modern_Times","37691769_Urban_Design_in_Western_Europe_Regime_and_Architecture_900-1900"]}
