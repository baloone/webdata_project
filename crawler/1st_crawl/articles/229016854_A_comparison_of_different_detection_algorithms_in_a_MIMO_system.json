{"id":"229016854_A_comparison_of_different_detection_algorithms_in_a_MIMO_system","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a the different detection scheme for MIMO systems such as maximum-likelihood (ML) detection of MIMO signals which requires computational resources that are above from the capabilities of most practical systems. Alternative in order to reduce the complexity MIMO detection techniques are proposed, but the complexity of algorithmic schemes are in higher than that of the equalizer-based techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE. The equalizer based solution for detection have a relatively poor performance in terms of error rate. In this paper, we compare the BER for the following detection scheme MMSE,ML and ZF detection technique for a 4x4 MIMO system. Also we compare these detection schemes for a 1x4,2x4,3x4 ,4x4MIMO system.","authors":["Kuldeep Kumar","Dr-Manwinder Singh Goraya"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["224602923_Distributed_Compression_for_MIMO_Coordinated_Networks_with_a_Backhaul_Constraint","224439832_Networked_MIMO_with_Clustered_Linear_Precoding","220683201_On_maximum-likelihood_detection_and_the_search_for_the_closest_lattice_point","3432822_Downlink_Capacity_of_Interference-Limited_MIMO_Systems_With_Joint_Detection","3236239_Algorithm_and_implementation_of_the_K-best_Sphere_decoding_for_MIMO_detection","3235725_Optimizing_MIMO_antenna_systems_with_channel_covariance_feedback","4332266_Optimum_Zero-Forcing_Beamforming_with_Per-Antenna_Power_Constraints","3433791_Joint_compensation_of_transmitter_and_receiver_impairments_in_OFDM_systems","3350674_Coordinating_Multiple_Antenna_Cellular_Networks_to_Achieve_Enormous_Spectral_Efficiency","3318723_Efficient_detection_algorithms_for_MIMO_channels_A_geometrical_approach_to_approximate_ML_detection"]}
