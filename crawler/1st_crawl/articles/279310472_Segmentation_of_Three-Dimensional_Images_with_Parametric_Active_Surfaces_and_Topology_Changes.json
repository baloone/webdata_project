{"id":"279310472_Segmentation_of_Three-Dimensional_Images_with_Parametric_Active_Surfaces_and_Topology_Changes","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a novel parametric method for segmentation of\nthree-dimensional images. We consider a piecewise constant version of the\nMumford-Shah and the Chan-Vese functionals and perform a region-based\nsegmentation of 3D image data. An evolution law is derived from energy\nminimization problems which push the surfaces to the boundaries of 3D objects\nin the image. We propose a parametric scheme which describes the evolution of\nparametric surfaces. An efficient finite element scheme is proposed for a\nnumerical approximation of the evolution equations. Since standard parametric\nmethods cannot handle topology changes automatically, an efficient method is\npresented to detect, identify and perform changes in the topology of the\nsurfaces. One main focus of this paper are the algorithmic details to handle\ntopology changes like splitting and merging of surfaces and change of the genus\nof a surface. Different artificial images are studied to demonstrate the\nability to detect the different types of topology changes. Finally, the\nparametric method is applied to segmentation of medical 3D images.","authors":["Heike Frei","Harald Garcke"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Scientific Computing 72(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-017-0401-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281413373_Numerical_algorithm_for_tracking_cell_dynamics_in_4D_biomedical_images","275836404_Segmentation_and_Restoration_of_Images_on_Surfaces_by_Parametric_Active_Contours_with_Topology_Changes","321620115_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_the_Calculus_of_Variations","313617603_Lagrangean_method_with_topological_changes_for_numerical_modelling_of_forest_fire_propagation","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","310439326_A_review_of_statistical_approaches_to_level_set_segmentation_Integrating_color_texture_motion_and_shape","297472167_Total_variation_denoising_and_enhancement_of_color_images_based_on_the_CB_and_HSV_color_models","284653608_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","282194389_Narrow_band_region-based_active_contours_and_surfaces_for_2D_and_3D_segmentation","263155724_A_Multiphase_Level_Set_Framework_for_Image_Segmentation_Using_the_Mumford_and_Shah_Model","261144367_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing","258291542_New_fast_and_stable_Lagrangean_method_for_image_segmentation","258291381_Lagrangean_method_with_topological_changes_for_numerical_modelling_of_forest_fire_propagation","255731247_Efficient_Image_Segmentation_and_Restoration_Using_Parametric_Curve_Evolution_with_Junctions_and_Topology_Changes","245481718_Computation_of_geometric_partial_differential_equations_and_mean_curvature_flow"]}
