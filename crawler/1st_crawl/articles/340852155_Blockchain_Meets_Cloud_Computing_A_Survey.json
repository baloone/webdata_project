{"id":"340852155_Blockchain_Meets_Cloud_Computing_A_Survey","abstract":"Blockchain technology has been deemed to be an ideal choice for strengthening existing computing systems in varied manners. As one of the network-enabled technologies, cloud computing has been broadly adopted in the industry through numerous cloud service models. Fusing blockchain technology with existing cloud systems has a great potential in both functionality/ performance enhancement and security/ privacy improvement. The question remains on how blockchain technology inserts into current deployed cloud solutions and enables the reengineering of cloud datacenter. This survey addresses this issue and investigates recent efforts in the technical fusion of blockchain and clouds. Three technical dimensions roughly are covered in this work. First, we concern the service model and review an emerging cloud-relevant blockchain service model, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS); second, security is considered a key technical dimension in this work and both access control and searchable encryption schemes are assessed; finally, we examine the performance of cloud datacenter with supports/ participance of blockchain from hardware and software perspectives. Main findings of this survey will be theoretical supports for future reference of blockchain-enabled reengineering of cloud datacenter.","authors":["Keke Gai","Jinnan Guo","Liehuang Zhu","Shui
