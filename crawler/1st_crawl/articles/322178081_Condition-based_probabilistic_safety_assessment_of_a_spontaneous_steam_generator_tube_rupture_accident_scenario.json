{"id":"322178081_Condition-based_probabilistic_safety_assessment_of_a_spontaneous_steam_generator_tube_rupture_accident_scenario","abstract":"Condition-Based Probabilistic Safety Assessment (CB-PSA) makes use of the information made available during operation by sensors and/or inspections on the state of components and systems. This allows specializing the PSA to the conditions of the components and systems, reducing the uncertainty on the risk measures quantified.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the CB-PSA with reference to a spontaneous Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR) accident scenario in a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Results show that the updated risk measures are capable of reflecting the actual state of the SG in the tailored risk evaluation.","authors":["Francesco Di Maio","Federico Antonello","Enrico Zio"],"meta":["January 2018Nuclear Engineering and Design 326:41-54","DOI:10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.10.020"],"references":["305821220_Some_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Reliability_Engineering","266322134_Risk_management_of_NPPs_using_risk_monitors"]}
