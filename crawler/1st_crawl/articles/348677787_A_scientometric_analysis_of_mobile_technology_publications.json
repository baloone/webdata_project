{"id":"348677787_A_scientometric_analysis_of_mobile_technology_publications","abstract":"This paper focus on the growth and development of mobile technology research in terms of publication output as reflected in Web of Science database. During 2000â€“2013 a total of 10,638 publications were published in the field. The average number of publications published per year was 759.86 and the highest number of publications 1495 were published in 2013. Output of total publications, 9037 were produced by multiple authors and 1601 by single authors. Authors from USA have contributed maximum number of publications compared to the other countries and India stood 16th ranking in terms of productivity in this study period. The most prolific author is Kim who contributed 42 publications followed by Kim with 36 publications. Collaboration Index ranges from 3.67 (2000) to 4.57 (2009) with an average of 4.32 per joint authored paper which implies the\nresearch team falls between 3 and 5 in the field of mobile technology. University of California System (USA) is the highly contributed institutions with 243 publications followed by University of London (UK) with 149 publications, Florida State University System (USA), National Chiao Tung University (China) with 88 publications.","authors":["R.
