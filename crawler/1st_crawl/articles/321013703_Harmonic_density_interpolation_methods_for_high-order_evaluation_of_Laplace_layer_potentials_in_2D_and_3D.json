{"id":"321013703_Harmonic_density_interpolation_methods_for_high-order_evaluation_of_Laplace_layer_potentials_in_2D_and_3D","abstract":"We present a simple but effective harmonic density interpolation method for the numerical evaluation of singular and nearly singular Laplace boundary integral operators and layer potentials in two and three spatial dimensions. The method relies on the use of Green's third identity and local Taylor-like interpolations of density functions in terms of harmonic polynomials. The proposed technique effectively regularizes the singularities present in boundary integral operators and layer potentials, and recasts the latter in terms of integrands that are continuous or even more regular, depending on the density interpolation order. The resulting boundary integrals can then be easily, accurately, and inexpensively evaluated by means of standard quadrature rules. A variety of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique when used in conjunction with the classical trapezoidal rule (to integrate over smooth curves) in two-dimensions, and with a Chebyshev-type quadrature rule (to integrate over surfaces given as unions of non-overlapping quadrilateral patches) in three-dimensions.","authors":["Carlos PÃ©rez-Arancibia","Luiz M Faria","Catalin Turc"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Computational Physics 376(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.002","Project: Density Interpolation Methods"],"references":["320149425_A_plane-wave_singularity_subtraction_technique_for_the_classical_Dirichlet_and_Neumann_combined_field_integral_equations","315835203_Adaptive_Quadrature_by_Expansion_for_Layer_Potential_Evaluation_in_Two_Dimensions","301648385_A_fast_integral_equation_method_for_solid_particles_in_viscous_flow_using_quadrature_by_expansion","328713858_A_Chebyshev-based_rectangular-polar_integral_solver_for_scattering_by_general_geometries_described_by_non-overlapping_patches","318460956_A_local_target_specific_quadrature_by_expansion_method_for_evaluation_of_layer_potentials_in_3D","280696061_A_Simple_Method_for_Computing_Singular_or_Nearly_Singular_Integrals_on_Closed_Surfaces","275062996_The_Exponentially_Convergent_Trapezoidal_Rule","269039592_Solving_Boundary_Integral_Problems_with_BEM","268609513_Methods_of_numerical_integration_Corrected_reprint_of_the_1984_2nd_ed","268272446_Nearly_Singular_Integrals_in_3D_Stokes_Flow"]}
