{"id":"306270899_Topic_Tensor_Factorization_for_Recommender_System","abstract":"Reviews are collaboratively generated by users on items and generally contain rich information than ratings in a recommender system scenario. Ratings are modeled successfully with latent space models by capturing interaction between users and items. However, only a few models collaboratively deal with documents such as reviews. In this study, by modeling reviews as a three-order tensor, we propose a refined tensor topic model (TTM) for text tensors inspired by Tucker decomposition. User and item dimensions are co-reduced with vocabulary space, and interactions between users and items are captured using a core tensor in dimension-reduced form. TTM is proposed to obtain low-rank representations of words as well as of users and items. Furthermore, general rules are developed to transform a decomposition model into a probabilistic model. TTM is augmented further to predict ratings with the assistance of a low-dimensional representation of users and items obtained by TTM. This augmented model is called matrix factorization by learning a bilinear map. A core regularized version is further developed to incorporate additional information from the TTM. Encouraging experimental results not only show that the TTM outperforms existing topic models in modeling texts with a user-item-word structure, but also show that our proposed rating prediction models outperform state-of-the-art approaches.","authors":["Xiaolin Zheng","Weifeng Ding","Zhen Lin","Chaochao Chen"],"meta":["August 2016Information Sciences 372","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2016.08.042"],"references":["290863153_Collaborative_Topic_Modeling_for_Text_Tensors","280105148_Collaborative_Deep_Learning_for_Recommender_Systems","274404083_Relational_Collaborative_Topic_Regression_for_Recommender_Systems","268792046_17beta-estradiol_promotes_the_odontoosteogenic_differentiation_of_stem_cells_from_apical_papilla_via_mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_pathway","229157667_The_Author-Topic_Model_for_Authors_and_Documents","221997021_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","221520054_Recommender_systems_with_social_regularization","221141030_Performance_of_recommender_algorithms_on_top-N_recommendation_tasks","220698796_An_Analysis_of_Probabilistic_Methods_for_Top-N_Recommendation_in_Collaborative_Filtering","220320734_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Topic_Models","305067299_A_Scalable_Asynchronous_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Topic_Modeling","301917111_Latent_Space_Regularization_for_Recommender_Systems","297889830_User_Profiling_Approaches_for_Demographic_Recommender_Systems","294723697_Improving_the_Accuracy_of_Top-N_Recommendation_using_a_Preference_Model","290506719_Dynamic_Topic_Adaptation_for_Phrase-based_MT","287603165_A_Generative_Model_for_User_Simulation_in_a_Spatial_Navigation_Domain","286642222_TopicMF_Simultaneously_exploiting_ratings_and_reviews_for_recommendation","285519713_Implications_of_factor_analysis_of_three-way_matrices_for_measurement_of_change","285489497_Partially_Collapsed_Gibbs_Sampling_for_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Models","281705029_FLAME_A_Probabilistic_Model_Combining_Aspect_Based_Opinion_Mining_and_Collaborative_Filtering","281132218_Tensor_completion_using_total_variation_and_low-rank_matrix_factorization","275673266_Matrix_completion_incorporating_auxiliary_information_for_recommender_system_design","275671951_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization_with_Auxiliary_Information_on_Overlapping_Groups","275059591_A_model_to_represent_users_trust_in_recommender_systems_using_ontologies_and_fuzzy_linguistic_modeling","274509414_Sentiment_analysis_A_review_and_comparative_analysis_of_web_services","270594888_GPUTENSOR_Efficient_tensor_factorization_for_context-aware_recommendations","266658580_A_collective_topic_model_for_milestone_paper_discovery","262771885_LARS_An_Efficient_and_Scalable_Location-Aware_Recommender_System","262409394_On_the_design_of_LDA_models_for_aspect-based_opinion_mining","262326467_The_FLDA_model_for_aspect-based_opinion_mining_addressing_the_cold_start_problem","262205718_Hidden_factors_and_hidden_topics_Understanding_rating_dimensions_with_review_text","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","262146681_A_social_recommender_mechanism_for_location-based_group_commerce","257404071_A_literature_review_and_classification_of_recommender_systems_research_Expert_Systems_with_Applications_3911_10059-10072","254464188_The_contextual_focused_topic_model","254008768_Care_to_comment_Recommendations_for_commenting_on_news_stories","221654609_Factorization_meets_the_neighborhood_A_multifaceted_collaborative_filtering_model","221654332_Collaborative_topic_modeling_for_recommending_scientific_articles","221653469_Regression-based_latent_factor_models","221618016_Correlated_Topic_Models","221520201_Pairwise_Interaction_Tensor_Factorization_for_Personalized_Tag_Recommendation","221345785_Bayesian_probabilistic_matrix_factorization_using_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo","220766482_Factorization_Machines","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220116494_Tensor_Decompositions_and_Applications"]}
