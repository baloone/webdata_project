As time has changed, employability is based on knowledge and several abilities such as soft skills, communication, leadership, creative and critical thinking. It is hard for universities to keep track of all these changes and, at the same time, the technological advancements, the hard facts and the skills of most of the disciplines. Our research aims to study the needs requested the most by employers. To achieve that, we started with a survey with some laureates and multiple interviews with different recruiters to identify their requirements. We can define the training students need to have before integrating the job market, ease their insertion, and make their integration successful.","authors":["Zineb Sabri","Aniss Moumen","Youssef FAKHRI"],"meta":["January 2021SHS Web of Conferences 119(1):05005","DOI:10.1051/shsconf/202111905005"],"references":["348497849_Gamifying_eLearning_to_Improve_Professional_Integration_to_Labor_Market_Systematic_Literature_Review","281050326_Tools_and_Methods_for_Efficiently_Designing_Serious_Games"]}
