{"id":"349805299_P_systems_with_limited_number_of_objects","abstract":"P systems are a model of compartmentalized multiset rewriting inspired by the structure of living cells and the way they function. In this paper, we focus of a variant in P systems in which membranes have limited capacity, i.e., the number of objects they may hold is limited by a fixed bound. This feature corresponds to an important physical property of cellular compartments. We propose several possible semantics of limited capacity and show that one of them allows real-time simulations of partially blind register machines, while the other one allows for obtaining computational completeness.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund","Sergiu Ivanov"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Membrane Computing 3(3):1-9","DOI:10.1007/s41965-020-00068-6"],"references":["344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","300111779_On_the_Power_of_Catalytic_P_Systems_with_One_Catalyst","273945962_P_Systems_with_Toxic_Objects","273945895_Length_P_Systems","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing","223827187_Computing_with_membranes_J_Comput_Syst_Sci","222397668_Computationally_universal_P_systems_without_priorities_Two_catalysts_are_sufficient"]}
