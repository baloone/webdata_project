{"id":"337688507_Big_Five_Personality_Traits_and_Ensemble_Machine_Learning_to_Detect_Cyber-Violence_in_Social_Media","abstract":"Cyber-violence is a largely addressed problem in e-health researches, its focus is the detection of harmful behavior from online user-generated content in order to prevent and protect victims. In this work, we show how big five personality traits are correlated to the violent behavior of the cyber-violence perpetrator. We use a set of ensemble learning algorithms with engineered features related to the vocabulary used in each Big Five personality trait namely, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness. The findings show a significant association between the individuals’ personality state and the harmful intention. This result can be a good indicator of online users’ susceptibility to cyber-violence and therefore can help in dealing with it.","authors":["Randa Zarnoufi","Mounia Abik"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-36778-7_21","In book: Innovation in Information Systems and Technologies to Support Learning Research (pp.194-202)"],"references":["337631666_Hate_speech_detection_on_Twitter_feature_engineering_vs_feature_selection","324755441_A_Quality_Type-aware_Annotated_Corpus_and_Lexicon_for_Harassment_Research","323411032_Publishing_a_Quality_Context-aware_Annotated_Corpus_and_Lexicon_for_Harassment_Research","318330507_Mean_Birds_Detecting_Aggression_and_Bullying_on_Twitter","317088014_Latent_Human_Traits_in_the_Language_of_Social_Media_An_Open-Vocabulary_Approach","300208221_Analyzing_Labeled_Cyberbullying_Incidents_on_the_Instagram_Social_Network","282124505_The_Development_and_Psychometric_Properties_of_LIWC2015","273640275_Detection_of_Cyberbullying_Incidents_on_the_Instagram_Social_Network","257302212_Personality_Gender_and_Age_in_the_Language_of_Social_Media_The_Open-Vocabulary_Approach","249012795_Improving_Cyberbullying_Detection_with_User_Context","230701870_Towards_User_Modelling_in_the_Combat_Against_Cyberbullying","230701861_Improved_Cyberbullying_Detection_Using_Gender_Information","220543125_SMOTE_Synthetic_Minority_Over-sampling_Technique","330689767_Cyberbullying_detection_on_twitter_using_Big_Five_and_Dark_Triad_features","320318420_Approaches_to_Automated_Detection_of_Cyberbullying_A_Survey","309725171_Which_personality_traits_are_related_to_traditional_bullying_and_cyberbullying_A_study_with_the_Big_Five_Dark_Triad_and_sadism","305341890_Hateful_Symbols_or_Hateful_People_Predictive_Features_for_Hate_Speech_Detection_on_Twitter","303691149_Cybercrime_detection_in_online_communications_The_experimental_case_of_cyberbullying_detection_in_the_Twitter_network"]}
