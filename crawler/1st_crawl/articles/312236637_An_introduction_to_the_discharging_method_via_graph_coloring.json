{"id":"312236637_An_introduction_to_the_discharging_method_via_graph_coloring","abstract":"We provide a “how-to” guide to the use and application of the Discharging Method. Our aim is not to exhaustively survey results proved by this technique, but rather to demystify the technique and facilitate its wider use, using applications in graph coloring as examples. Along the way, we present some new proofs and new problems.","authors":["Daniel W. Cranston","Douglas B.
