{"id":"224091072_Real_Time_Motion_Generation_and_Control_for_Biped_Robot-1st_Report_Walking_Gait_Pattern_Generation","abstract":"Generating stable dynamic motions for a biped robot in real time is difficult due to the unstable nature of biped systems and their high degrees of freedom. We propose an approximate dynamics model for biped robots with three masses and no kinematic constraints. We also propose a relaxed boundary condition called Â¿the divergent component of motionÂ¿. These techniques allow us to generate walking gait patterns with large margin from the edges of support polygon in real time.","authors":["Tom Takenaka","Takashi Matsumoto","Takahide Yoshiike"],"meta":["November 2009","DOI:10.1109/IROS.2009.5354662","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2009.
