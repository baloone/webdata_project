{"id":"281050359_Turning_a_Near-hovering_Controlled_Quadrotor_into_a_3D_Force_Effector","abstract":"In this paper the problem of a quadrotor that physically interacts with the surrounding environment through a rigid tool is considered. We present a theoretical design that allows to exert an arbitrary 3D force by using a standard near-hovering controller that was originally developed for contact-free flight control. This is achieved by analytically solving the nonlinear system that relates the quadrotor state, the force exerted by the rigid tool on the environment, and the near-hovering controller action at the equilibrium points, during any generic contact. Stability of the equilibria for the most relevant actions (pushing, releasing, lifting, dropping, and left-right shifting) are proven by means of numerical analysis using the indirect Lyapunov method. An experimental platform, including a suitable tool design, has been developed and used to validate the theory with preliminary experiments.","authors":["Guido Gioioso","Markus Ryll","Domenico Prattichizzo","Heinrich H BÃ¼lthoff"],"meta":["May 2014Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907785"],"references":["278769332_Reshaping_the_physical_properties_of_a_quadrotor_through_IDA-PBC_and_its_application_to_aerial_physical_interaction","261353596_Exploiting_redundancy_in_Cartesian_impedance_control_of_UAVs_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","260330773_Semi-Autonomous_Haptic_Teleoperation_Control_Architecture_of_Multiple_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","226430309_Grasping","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","269253778_Controlled_Manipulation_with_Multiple_Quadrotors","267491950_Mechanics_and_Control_of_Quadrotors_for_Tool_Operation","261495659_Modeling_and_control_of_a_flying_robot_for_contact_inspection","257581347_Modeling_and_Control_of_MM-UAV_Mobile_Manipulating_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","239763423_A_hybrid_pose_wrench_control_framework_for_quadrotor_helicopters","233863156_Bilateral_Teleoperation_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Robots_With_Time-Varying_Topology","224173788_The_GRASP_multiple_micro-uav_testbed","221042427_Modeling_and_control_of_VTOL_UAVs_interacting_with_the_environment","220159697_Modelling_and_control_of_a_flying_robot_interacting_with_the_environment"]}
