{"id":"255705290_Online_formative_tests_linked_to_microlectures_improving_academic_achievement","abstract":"Background: \nOnline formative tests (OFTs) are powerful tools to direct student learning behavior, especially when enriched with specific feedback.\n\nAim: \nIn the present study, we have investigated the effect of OFTs enriched with hyperlinks to microlectures on examination scores.\n\nMethods: \nOFTs, available one week preceding each midterm and the final exams, could be used voluntarily. The use of OFTs was related to scores on midterm and final exams using ANOVA, with prior academic achievement as a covariate.\n\nResults: \nOn average, 74% of all students used the online formative tests (OFT+) while preparing for the summative midterm exam. OFT+ students obtained significantly higher grades compared to OFT-students, both without and with correction for previous academic achievement. Two out of three final exam scores did not significantly improve.\n\nConclusion: \nStudents using online formative tests linked to microlectures receive higher grades especially in highly aligned summative tests.","authors":["Rianne Bouwmeester","Renske de Kleijn","Astrid W M Freriksen","Maarten G van Emst"],"meta":["August 2013Medical Teacher","DOI:10.3109/0142159X.2013.818633","SourcePubMed"],"references":["256836063_Students'_motives_for_using_online_formative_assessments_when_preparing_for_summative_assessments","228559299_What_the_Student_Does_teaching_for_enhanced_learning","11857306_What_Happens_To_the_Student_The_Neglected_Variable_in_Educational_Outcome_Research","341412627_What_the_student_does_Teaching_for_enhanced_learning","227527296_The_Efficacy_of_a_World-Wide_Web_Mediated_Formative_Assessment","220140561_Online_formative_assessment_in_higher_education_A_review_of_the_literature","44597233_Time_and_learning_efficiency_in_Internet-based_learning_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","23759317_Podcasts_and_videostreaming_Useful_tools_to_facilitate_learning_of_pathophysiology_in_undergraduate_nurse_education","23288311_Test-enhanced_learning_in_medical_education","5948381_Student_Decisions_about_Lecture_Attendance_Do_Electronic_Course_Materials_Matter"]}
