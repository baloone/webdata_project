{"id":"319908118_Computational_investigation_of_electrostatic_interactions","abstract":"We explore the geometry of the electrostatic potential due to two electrical charges. We emphasize that two dimensional contours of these graphics represent equipotential curves and the three-dimensional (3D) contours represent equipotential surfaces. We also examine the geometry of 3D contours of electrostatic potential due to multiple charges in different arrangements. We notice that the geometry of the 3D contours of electrostatic potential is affected by the polarity of the electric charges.","authors":["Aalok Pandya"],"meta":["September 2017Physics Essays 30(3):302-307","DOI:10.4006/0836-1398-30.3.302"],"references":["2058225_Resource_Letter_NSST-1_The_nature_and_status_of_string_theory"]}
