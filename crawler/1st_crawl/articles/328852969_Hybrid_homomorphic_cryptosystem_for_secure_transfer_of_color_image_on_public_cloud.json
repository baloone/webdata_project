{"id":"328852969_Hybrid_homomorphic_cryptosystem_for_secure_transfer_of_color_image_on_public_cloud","abstract":"Cloud computing is a model of advanced computing that has an important impact on information technology and provides access to the shared digital resources that existed in cloud servers by using Web services. Great benefits for users through cloud computing such as social networking, banking, finance, storage, e-mail, and many features related to flexibility, ease of use and reliability with high performance and low cost. On the other hand, cloud applications and information are vulnerable to security breaches by unauthorized parties as a result of the shared and online resource environment, which requires protection through appropriate policies, techniques and controls to protect published data, applications, infrastructure and related components of cloud computing. This paper presents three efficient hybrid homomorphic encryption techniques for image encryption to ensure the safe exchange of private images in the public cloud based on the block pixel position. The proposed techniques are constraint on El-Gamal and Enhanced Homomorphic Cryptosystem (EHC). Many methods of security analysis have been implemented on proposed techniques which used many types of images with many experiments. The results showed that our methods are very invulnerability and efficient in terms of security and time compared with El-Gamal and EHC schemes, because they take the good characteristics of El-Gamal and EHC methods like very good security and small run time executions.","authors":["H.M.
