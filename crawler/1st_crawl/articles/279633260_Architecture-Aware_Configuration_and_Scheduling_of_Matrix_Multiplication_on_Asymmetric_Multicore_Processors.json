{"id":"279633260_Architecture-Aware_Configuration_and_Scheduling_of_Matrix_Multiplication_on_Asymmetric_Multicore_Processors","abstract":"Asymmetric multicore processors (AMPs) have recently emerged as an appealing\ntechnology for severely energy-constrained environments, especially in mobile\nappliances where heterogeneity in applications is mainstream. In addition,\ngiven the growing interest for low-power high performance computing, this type\nof architectures is also being investigated as a means to improve the\nthroughput-per-Watt of complex scientific applications.\nIn this paper, we design and embed several architecture-aware optimizations\ninto a multi-threaded general matrix multiplication (gemm), a key operation of\nthe BLAS, in order to obtain a high performance implementation for ARM\nbig.LITTLE AMPs. Our solution is based on the reference implementation of gemm\nin the BLIS library, and integrates a cache-aware configuration as well as\nasymmetric--static and dynamic scheduling strategies that carefully tune and\ndistribute the operation's micro-kernels among the big and LITTLE cores of the\ntarget processor. The experimental results on a Samsung Exynos 5422, a\nsystem-on-chip with ARM Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters that implements the\nbig.LITTLE model, expose that our cache-aware versions of gemm with asymmetric\nscheduling attain important gains in performance with respect to its\narchitecture-oblivious counterparts while exploiting all the resources of the\nAMP to deliver considerable energy efficiency.","authors":["Sandra Catalán","Francisco Igual","Rafael Mayo","Rafael Rodríguez-Sánchez"],"meta":["September 2016Cluster Computing 19(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10586-016-0611-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261673110_Analysis_of_Dynamic_Scheduling_Strategies_for_Matrix_Multiplication_on_Heterogeneous_Platforms","261596622_Supercomputing_with_commodity_CPUs_Are_mobile_SoCs_ready_for_HPC","311666398_Scalable_thread_scheduling_and_global_power_management_for_heterogeneous_many-core_architectures","310825024_Analytical_Modeling_Is_Enough_for_High-Performance_BLIS","303904773_The_BLIS_Framework_Experiments_in_Portability","285621547_Dark_silicon_and_the_end_of_multicore_scaling_SIGARCH_Comput","269268515_Anatomy_of_High-Performance_Many-Threaded_Matrix_Multiplication","262288069_Improving_Performance_per_Watt_of_Asymmetric_Multi-Core_Processors_via_Online_Program_Phase_Classification_and_Adaptive_Core_Morphing","261151192_Tools_for_Power-Energy_Modelling_and_Analysis_of_Parallel_Scientific_Applications","256744438_Energy_efficiency_vs_performance_of_the_numerical_solution_of_PDEs_An_application_study_on_a_low-power_ARM-based_cluster"]}
