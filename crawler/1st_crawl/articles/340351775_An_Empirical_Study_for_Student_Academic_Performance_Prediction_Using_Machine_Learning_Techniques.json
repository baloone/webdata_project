{"id":"340351775_An_Empirical_Study_for_Student_Academic_Performance_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","abstract":"Predicting students' academic performance is of great concern for both students and educational institutions. Drawing on the prediction of learning outcome, lecturers and institutional administrators can facilitate students' learning plan by making adjustments to the lectures and curriculum. Academic performance of students can depend on various factors such as academic progress, personal characteristics and behaviors relating to learning activities. This paper investigate the machine learning techniques to predict the final Grade Point Average of students based on personal characteristics (comprising gender and living location), university entry scores, gap year, and their academic performance of the first and second year. The data is collected by combining data from a survey of graduate students of three different years and data from the student management information system of the university. The result proved the correlation between the aforementioned factors and the academic performance of students and it also revealed the most suitable technique for student performance prediction by empirical study.","authors":["Ha Dinh","Giap Cu Nguyen","Thi To Loan Pham"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 18(3)","Project: Machine learning for economics and business student performance prediction in Vietnam"],"references":["335665846_A_systematic_review_on_the_status_and_progress_of_homomorphic_encryption_technologies","334018709_A_machine_learning_algorithm_framework_for_predicting_students_performance_A_case_study_of_baccalaureate_students_in_Morocco","326845974_The_impact_of_a_fun_therapy_and_modifying_the_negative_thoughts_and_attitudes_in_reducing_the_anxiety_of_the_exam_among_university_students","323184469_Using_Naive_Bayes_Algorithm_to_Students'_bachelor_Academic_Performances_Analysis","320298124_Literature_Survey_on_Student's_Performance_Prediction_in_Education_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","319581292_Effects_of_lecture_attendance_aptitude_individual_heterogeneity_and_pedagogic_intervention_on_student_performance_A_probability_model_approach","318466873_Predicting_high-risk_students_using_Internet_access_logs","318184224_Performance_Prediction_for_Students_A_Multi-Strategy_Approach","326893443_A_survey_on_educational_data_mining_techniques_in_predicting_student's_academic_performance","326326068_Data_mining_techniques_applied_in_educational_environments_Literature_review"]}
