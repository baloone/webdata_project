{"id":"220532704_A_58_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_TSP","abstract":"The maximum asymmetric traveling salesperson problem, also known as the taxicab rip-off problem, is the problem of finding a maximally weighted tour in a complete asymmetric graph with nonnegative weights.We propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the problem with a 5/8 approximation guarantee. This (1) improves upon the approximation factors of previous results and (2) presents a simpler solution to the previously fairly involved algorithms. Our solution uses a simple linear programming formulation. Previous solutions were combinatorial. We make use of the linear programming in a novel manner and strengthen the path-coloring method originally proposed in [S. R. Kosaraju, J. K. Park, and C. Stein, Long tours and short superstrings, in Proceedings of the 35th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1994, pp. 166--177].","authors":["Moshe Lewenstein","Maxim Sviridenko"],"meta":["November 2003SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 17(2):237-248","DOI:10.1137/S0895480102402861","SourceDBLP"],"references":["284050874_Estimate_of_the_error_of_series_of_approximate_algorithms","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","242911397_boldmath_A_2frac12Approximation_Algorithm_for_Shortest_Superstring","239066452_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Weight_Hamiltonian_Circuit","239063221_Edge-Colourings_of_Graphs","225251521_Worst-Case_Comparison_of_Valid_Inequalities_for_the_TSP","223678501_A_greedy_approximation_algorithm_for_constructing_shortest_common_superstrings","222446992_Approximation_algorithms_for_the_shortest_common_superstring_problem","220896936_Approximation_Hardness_of_TSP_with_Bounded_Metrics","220770624_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles"]}
