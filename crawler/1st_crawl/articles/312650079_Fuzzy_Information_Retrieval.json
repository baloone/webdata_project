{"id":"312650079_Fuzzy_Information_Retrieval","abstract":"Information retrieval used to mean looking through thousands of strings of texts to find words or symbols that matched a user's query. Today, there are many models that help index and search more effectively so retrieval takes a lot less time. Information retrieval (IR) is often seen as a subfield of computer science and shares some modeling, applications, storage applications and techniques, as do other disciplines like artificial intelligence, database management, and parallel computing. This book introduces the topic of IR and how it differs from other computer science disciplines. A discussion of the history of modern IR is briefly presented, and the notation of IR as used in this book is defined. The complex notation of relevance is discussed. Some applications of IR is noted as well since IR has many practical uses today. Using information retrieval with fuzzy logic to search for software terms can help find software components and ultimately help increase the reuse of software. This is jus...","authors":["Donald Kraft","Erin Colvin"],"meta":["January 2017Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts Retrieval and Services 9(1):i-63","DOI:10.2200/S00752ED1V01Y201701ICR055"],"references":["273600615_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Negation_and_Speculation_Detection_for_Sentiment_Analysis","225172526_A_Comprehensive_OWA-Based_Framework_for_Result_Merging_in_Metasearch","221580221_Discounted_Cumulative_Gain_and_User_Decision_Models","321576960_Fifty_Years_of_Fuzzy_Logic_and_its_Applications","306524228_A_Novel_User_Profile_Learning_Approach_with_Fuzzy_Constraint_for_News_Retrieval","257671597_Personalised_Information_Retrieval_Survey_and_classification","235350471_Fuzzy_Sets_in_Information_Retrieval_and_Cluster_Analysis","229558122_Fuzzy_Requests_An_Approach_to_Weighted_Boolean_Searches","221397671_Multidimensional_Relevance_A_New_Aggregation_Criterion","220434156_Soft_Approaches_to_Information_Retrieval_and_Information_Access_on_the_Web","3187372_An_Information_Retrieval_Approach_for_Automatically_Constructing_Software_Libraries_IEEE_Transactions_on_Software_Engineering_17_8_800-813","3951684_A_user-adaptive_indexing_model_of_structured_documents","3754537_Information_retrieval_systems_where_is_the_fuzz"]}
