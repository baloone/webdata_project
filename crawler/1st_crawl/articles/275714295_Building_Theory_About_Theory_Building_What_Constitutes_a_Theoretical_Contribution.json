{"id":"275714295_Building_Theory_About_Theory_Building_What_Constitutes_a_Theoretical_Contribution","abstract":"We distill existing literature on theoretical contribution into two dimensions, originality (incremental or revelatory) and utility (scientific or practical). We argue for a revision in the way scholars approach the utility dimension by calling for a view of theorizing that would enable theories with more \"scope\" (both scientific and practical utility). We also argue for an orientation toward \"prescience\" as a way of achieving scope and fulfilling our scholarly role of facilitating organizational and societal adaptiveness.","authors":["Kevin G.
