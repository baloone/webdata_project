{"id":"321714774_Performance_Evaluation_of_CNTFET-based_Logic_Gates_using_Verilog-AMS","abstract":"In this work we present the performance of Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) using circuit compatible Verilog-AMS model. CNTFET utilizes a semiconducting Carbon nanotube (CNT) channel controlled by isolated electrostatic gates. Circuit-compatible model of ambipolar CNTFET, which demonstrates p-type or n-type switching behavior depending upon the gate voltage, is implemented in Verilog-AMS and the designs are extensively simulated in SPICE. The power and delay performance of CNTFET has been investigated in basic logic gates as well as combinational logic block like half and full-adders based on this Verilog-AMS model.
