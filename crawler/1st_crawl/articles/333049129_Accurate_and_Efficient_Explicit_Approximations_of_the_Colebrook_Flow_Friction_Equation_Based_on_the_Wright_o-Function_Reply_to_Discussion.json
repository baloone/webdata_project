{"id":"333049129_Accurate_and_Efficient_Explicit_Approximations_of_the_Colebrook_Flow_Friction_Equation_Based_on_the_Wright_o-Function_Reply_to_Discussion","abstract":"This reply gives two corrections of typographical errors in respect to the commented article, and then provides few comments in respect to the discussion and one improved version of the approximation of the Colebrook equation for flow friction, based on the Wright ω-function. Finally, this reply gives an exact explicit version of the Colebrook equation expressed through the Wright ω-function, which does not introduce any additional errors in respect to the original equation. All mentioned approximations are computationally efficient and also very accurate. Results are verified using more than 2 million of Quasi Monte-Carlo samples.","authors":["Dejan Brkić","Pavel Praks"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7050410","Project: Flow friction calculation - Colebrook equation"],"references":["333674308_Advanced_Iterative_Procedures_for_Solving_the_Implicit_Colebrook_Equation_for_Fluid_Flow_Friction","333157001_Short_Overview_of_Early_Developments_of_the_Hardy_Cross_Type_Methods_for_Computation_of_Flow_Distribution_in_Pipe_Networks","332429124_An_Efficient_Iterative_Method_for_Looped_Pipe_Network_Hydraulics_Free_of_Flow-Corrections","332238393_Evaluacion_experimental_de_la_solucion_analitica_exacta_de_la_ecuacion_de_Colebrook-White","331741607_Discussion_of_Accurate_and_Efficient_Explicit_Approximations_of_the_Colebrook_Flow_Friction_Equation_Based_on_the_Wright_o-Function_by_Dejan_Brkic_and_Pavel_Praks_Mathematics_2019_7_34_doi103390math70","331495874_PSEM_Approximations_for_Both_Branches_of_Lambert_W_Function_with_Applications","330528096_Experimental_evaluation_of_correlations_used_to_calculate_friction_factor_for_turbulent_flow_in_cylindrical_pipes","330169232_Explicit_Solutions_For_Turbulent_Flow_Friction_Factor_A_Review_Assessment_And_Approaches_Classification","330028162_Accurate_and_Efficient_Explicit_Approximations_of_the_Colebrook_Flow_Friction_Equation_Based_on_the_Wright_o-Function","329553333_Model-Based_Quantitative_Evaluation_of_Repair_Procedures_in_Gas_Distribution_Networks"]}
