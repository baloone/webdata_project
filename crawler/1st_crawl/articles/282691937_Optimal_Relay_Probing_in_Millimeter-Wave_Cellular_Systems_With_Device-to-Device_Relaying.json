{"id":"282691937_Optimal_Relay_Probing_in_Millimeter-Wave_Cellular_Systems_With_Device-to-Device_Relaying","abstract":"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems are power-limited and susceptible\nto blockages. As a result, mmWave connectivity will be likely to be\nintermittent. One promising approach to increasing mmWave connectivity and\nrange is to use relays. Device-to-device (D2D) communications open the door to\nthe vast opportunities of D2D and device-to-network relaying for mmWave\ncellular systems. In this correspondence, we study how to select a good relay\nfor a given source-destination pair in a two-hop mmWave cellular system, where\nthe mmWave links are subject to random Bernoulli blockages. In such a system,\nprobing more relays could potentially lead to the discovery of a better relay\nbut at the cost of more overhead. We find that the throughput-optimal relay\nprobing strategy is a pure threshold policy: the system can stop relay probing\nonce the achievable spectral efficiency of the currently probed two-hop link\nexceeds some threshold. In general, the spectral efficiency threshold can be\nobtained by solving a fixed point equation. For the special case with on/off\nmmWave links, we derive a closed-form solution for the threshold. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that the threshold-based relay probing strategy can yield\nremarkable throughput gains.","authors":["Ning Wei","Xingqin Lin","Zhongpei Zhang"],"meta":["October 2015IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 65(12)","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2016.2552239","SourcearXiv"],"references":["289249108_Modeling_Human_Blockers_in_Millimeter_Wave_Radio_Links","282181259_Exploiting_Device-to-Device_Communications_to_Enhance_Spatial_Reuse_for_Popular_Content_Downloading_in_Directional_mmWave_Small_Cells","276836079_Capacity_Enhancement_in_60_GHz_Based_D2D_Networks_by_Relay_Selection_and_Scheduling","264122992_Tractable_Model_for_Rate_in_Self-Backhauled_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Networks","262301982_What_will_5G_be","260393207_Coverage_and_Rate_Analysis_for_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Networks","259695154_Millimeter_Wave_Cellular_Wireless_Networks_Potentials_and_Challenges","258769263_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Multihop_Cellular_Networks_Using_Mobile_Relays","257246889_An_Overview_on_3GPP_Device-to-Device_Proximity_Services","253330346_An_Overview_of_Load_Balancing_in_HetNets_Old_Myths_and_Open_Problems","243458284_Millimeter_Wave_Beamforming_for_Wireless_Backhaul_and_Access_in_Small_Cell_Networks","224595656_Blockage_and_directivity_in_60_GHz_wireless_personal_area_networks_From_cross-layer_model_to_multihop_MAC_design","224386340_Distributed_Cooperative_MAC_for_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","224121871_Lifetime_Maximization_via_a_New_Cooperative_MAC_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","200708336_Selecting_a_Spatially_Efficient_Cooperative_Relay","3236261_A_Simple_Cooperative_Diversity_Method_based_on_Network_Path_Selection","3200107_Multihop_Cellular_Networks_Potential_Gains_Research_Challenges_and_a_Resource_Allocation_Framework","3199230_Relay-Based_Deployment_Concepts_for_Wireless_and_Mobile_Broadband_Radio","273645784_Millimeter_Wave_Mobile_Communications_for_5G_Cellular_It_Will_Work","273396710_Spectrum_Sharing_for_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","273394282_Multihop_cellular_From_research_to_systems_standards_and_applications_Guest_Editorial","269935286_Connectivity_of_Millimeter_Wave_Networks_With_Multi-Hop_Relaying","260524130_Millimeter-Wave_Beamforming_as_an_Enabling_Technology_for_5G_Cellular_Communications_Theoretical_Feasibility_and_Prototype_Results","238520878_mmWave_mobile_broadband_MMB_Unleashing_the_3-300GHz_spectrum","224597597_Relay_technologies_for_WiMAX_and_LTE-Advanced_mobile_systems","220465912_Distributed_Relay_Selection_and_Power_Control_for_Multiuser_Cooperative_Communication_Networks_Using_Stackelberg_Game","220129092_Link-Utility-Based_Cooperative_MAC_Protocol_for_Wireless_Multi-Hop_Networks","3544979_Development_and_application_of_a_cellular_repeater","3433953_MIMO_Configurations_for_Relay_Channels_Theory_and_Practice","3433564_Modulation_and_demodulation_for_cooperative_diversity_in_wireless_systems","3236497_Joint_optimization_of_relay_strategies_and_resource_allocations_in_cooperative_cellular_networks","3085563_Cooperative_Strategies_and_Capacity_Theorems_for_Relay_Networks","3085253_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks_Efficient_Protocols_and_Outage_Behavior"]}
