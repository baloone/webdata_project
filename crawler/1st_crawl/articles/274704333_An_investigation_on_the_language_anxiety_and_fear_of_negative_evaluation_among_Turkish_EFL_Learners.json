{"id":"274704333_An_investigation_on_the_language_anxiety_and_fear_of_negative_evaluation_among_Turkish_EFL_Learners","abstract":"Teachers' observations, students' experiences, and the review of related literature indicate that language anxiety is a significant factor adversely affecting the language learning process. Thus, this study aims to investigate the sources and levels of fear of negative evaluation as well as language anxiety among Turkish students as EFL learners, and to determine the correlation between the two. A foreign language anxiety scale and a scale for fear of negative evaluation were administered to a sample group of 112 foreign language learners. The collected data were used to provide a descriptive and correlational analysis. The results of the analysis indicated that EFL learners suffer from language anxiety and fear of negative evaluation. Furthermore, fear of negative evaluation itself was found to be a strong source of language anxiety. In light of the findings of the research, the following recommendations were noted: Firstly, in order to cope with anxiety, learning situations and context should be made less stressful. Effective communication is another way to relieve language anxiety.","authors":["Selami Aydin"],"meta":["January 2008Asian EFL Journal 30(1):421â€”444"],"references":["313561100_Preliminary_evidence_for_the_reliability_and_validity_of_a_foreign_language_anxiety_scale","293127412_Who_Are_Our_Students_A_Synthesis_of_Foreign_and_Second_Language_Research_on_Individual_Differences_with_Implications_for_Instructional_Practice","285650515_Helping_students_overcome_foreign_language_anxiety_A_foreign_language_anxiety_workshop","284908113_Competitiveness_and_anxiety_in_adult_second_language_learning_Looking_at_and_Through_the_Diary_Studies","284306210_Language_anxiety_From_theory_and_research_to_classroom_implications","270085758_Language_Anxiety_From_Theory_and_Research_to_Classroom_Implications","264594563_A_Relational_Model_for_Managing_Second_Language_Anxiety","263501160_Foreign_Language_Classroom_Anxiety","263061064_Research_on_Language_Learning_Strategies_Methods_Findings_and_Instructional_Issues","263061050_Foreign_Language_Learning_Differences_Affective_or_Native_Language_Aptitude_Differences"]}
