{"id":"271672066_Robotics_as_Means_to_Increase_Achievement_Scores_in_an_Informal_Learning_Environment","abstract":"This paper reports on a pilot study that examined the use of a science and technology curriculum based on robotics to increase the achievement scores of youth ages 9-11 in an after school program. The study examined and compared the pretest and posttest scores of youth in the robotics intervention with youth in a control group. The results revealed that youth in the robotics intervention had a significant increase in mean scores on the posttest and that the control group had no significant change in scores from the pretest to the posttest. In addition, the results of the study indicated that the evaluation instrument used to measure achievement was valid and reliable for this study.","authors":["Bradley Barker","John Ansorge"],"meta":["March 2007Journal of Research on Technology in Education 39(3):229-243","DOI:10.1080/15391523.2007.10782481"],"references":["235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","234752633_International_Outcomes_of_Learning_in_Mathematics_Literacy_and_Problem_Solving_PISA_2003_Results_from_the_US_Perspective_Highlights_NCES_2005-003","225238919_The_Robotic_Autonomy_Mobile_Robotics_Course_Robot_Design_Curriculum_Design_and_Educational_Assessment","11288517_Science_at_a_Crossroads","285756458_The_challenges_of_instructional_scaffolding_The_challenges_of_instruction_that_supports_student_thinking","249747589_Robotics-Driven_Activities_Can_They_Improve_Middle_School_Science_Learning","249039319_Using_Technological_Innovation_to_Improve_the_Problem-Solving_Skills_of_Middle_School_Students_Educators'_Experiences_with_the_LEGO_Mindstorms_Robotic_Invention_System","245968667_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Its_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Issues","225933399_A_theory-driven_approach_to_assessing_the_cognitive_effects_of_PBL","221536980_Teaching_introductory_Java_through_LEGO_MINDSTORMS_models","220425780_Using_Autonomous_Robotics_to_Teach_Science_and_Engineering","21636131_The_psychological_basis_of_problem-based_learning_A_review_of_the_evidence"]}
