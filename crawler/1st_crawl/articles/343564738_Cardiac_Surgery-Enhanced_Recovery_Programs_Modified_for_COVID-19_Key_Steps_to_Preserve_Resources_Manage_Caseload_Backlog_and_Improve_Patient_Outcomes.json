This is particularly true in cardiac surgery, which depends on the same equipment, hospital capacity, and personnel that have been re-directed to COVID-19 care. Enhanced recovery programs promote standardized, consistent perioperative care, with an emphasis on incorporating evidence-based measures to optimize the patient experience, improve outcomes and utilize resources efficiently. Developing and implementing a program in the current COVID-19 environment is a daunting task. The Society for Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERASÂ® Cardiac), representing an international, multi-disciplinary group of experts, provides the rationale, supportive evidence, and a proposed outline for a sustainable modified program within the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is feasible to launch in the current healthcare climate and is designed to preserve resources, reduce case backlog, and protect patient and provider safety while improving patient care and preserving institutional quality metrics. The program can also create the foundation for future growth.","authors":["Alexander J Gregory","Michael C.
