{"id":"322971800_Study_on_the_Detection_of_Cross-Site_Scripting_Vulnerabilities_Based_on_Reverse_Code_Audit","abstract":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most popular methods of current network attacks. The attackers mainly put malicious script into a web page through the vulnerabilities of the web application. This paper proposes an improved approach based on reverse code audit and static analysis to detect and extract the XSS vulnerabilities in the source code of the web application. In this paper, we give the theoretical definition and implementation algorithm related to this method. Also, our method can find the location of the vulnerability and the vulnerability of data source through the data link, so that testers and developers can fix vulnerabilities in Web applications immediately. Finally, the method is verified by experiment, which show that the method can not only effectively detect the potential XSS vulnerabilities in the code, but also significantly improve the detection efficiency of XSS vulnerabilities based on static analysis.","authors":["Fen Yan","Tao Qiao"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46257-8_17","In book: Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning â€“ IDEAL 2016 (pp.154-163)"],"references":["220647936_Ant_Algorithms_for_Discrete_Optimization_Artificial_Life_5_137-172","321600624_Engineering_of_Software_The_Continuing_Contributions_of_Leon_J_Osterweil","264123464_Current_State_of_research_on_cross-site_scripting_XSS_-_A_systematic_literature_review","243787670_Advanced_SQL_Injection_in_SQL_Server_Applications","237422172_Pixy_A_Static_Analysis_Tool_for_Detecting_Web_Application_Vulnerabilities_Technical_Report","235246959_Dynamic_Taint_Analysis_for_Automatic_Detection_Analysis_and_SignatureGeneration_of_Exploits_on_Commodity_Software","221436516_Auditing_the_Defense_Against_Cross_Site_Scripting_in_Web_Applications","220403832_Interprocedural_Control_Dependence"]}
