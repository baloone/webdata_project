{"id":"222709128_Unification_of_Concept_Terms_in_Description_Logics","abstract":"Unification of concept terms is a new kind of inference problem for description logics, which extends the equivalence problem by allowing one to replace certain concept names by concept terms before testing for equivalence. We show that this inference problem is of interest for applications, and present first decidability and complexity results for a small concept description language.","authors":["Franz Baader","Paliath Narendran"],"meta":["March 2001Journal of Symbolic Computation 31(3):277-305","DOI:10.1006/jsco.2000.0426","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221558412_The_Complexity_of_Set_Constraints","221153051_ODB-Tools_A_Description_Logics_Based_Tool_for_Schema_Validation_and_Semantic_Query_Optimization_in_Object_Oriented_Databases","221103282_Subsumption_between_Queries_to_Object-Oriented_Databases","220957358_Tractable_Concept_Languages","220957008_Asking_Queries_about_Frames","220836652_Subsumption_Algorithms_for_Concept_Description_Languages","220812406_A_Scheme_for_Integrating_Concrete_Domains_into_Concept_Languages","220688732_Tree_Automata","220388446_Matching_in_Description_Logics","46945929_Reasoning_and_Revision_in_Hybrid_Representation_Systems","3502872_LaSSIE_a_knowledge-based_software_information_system","2718411_Configuration_As_Model_Construction_The_Constructive_Problem_Solving_Approach","2707293_Unification_of_Concept_Terms_in_Description_Logics","2699848_Cardinality_Restrictions_on_Concepts","2659734_Combination_Problems_for_CommutativeMonoidal_Theories_or_How_Algebra_Can_Help_in_Equational_Unification","2638924_A_Knowledge-Based_Configurator_that_Supports_Sales_Engineering_and_Manufacturing_at_ATT_Network_Systems","248672970_Schmolze_An_overview_of_the_KL_-_ONE_knowledge_representation_system","242104272_Combination_Problens_for_CommutativeModoidal_Theories_or_How_Algebra_Can_Help_in_Equational_Unification","234800941_Automata_on_Infinite_Objects","230876746_The_KL-ONE_family","227631331_Expressiveness_and_tractability_in_knowledge_representation_and_reasoning","227330620_Cardinality_Restrictions_on_Concepts","225194458_Knowledge-Based_Disambiguation_for_Machine_Translation","225104549_Some_new_Decidability_Results_on_Positive_and_Negative_Set_Constraints","223419193_Unification_in_commutative_theories","222737163_Matching_-_A_special_case_of_unification","222498381_Incoherence_and_subsumption_for_recursive_views_and_queries_in_object-oriented_data_models","222451028_Terminological_reasoning_is_inherently_intractable","222439123_Computational_complexity_of_terminological_reasoning_in_BACK","222438991_An_overview_of_the_KL-ONE_Knowledge_Representation_System","221603421_Terminological_Cycles_in_KL-ONE-based_Knowledge_Representation_Languages","221562745_Cardinality_Restrictions_on_Concepts","221393586_The_Complexity_of_Concept_Languages","221393339_DLMS_an_evaluation_of_KL-ONE_in_the_automobile_industry","221393263_Qualifying_Number_Restrictions_in_Concept_Languages","220837716_Description_Logics_with_Symbolic_Number_Restrictions","220815856_Augmenting_Concept_Languages_by_Transitive_Closure_of_Roles_An_Alternative_to_Terminological_Cycles","220805813_Unification_in_Monoidal_Theories","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220545933_Attributive_Concept_Descriptions_with_Complements","220432054_Unification_in_Commutative_Theories_Hilbert's_Basis_Theorem_and_Grobner_Bases","220248094_The_Complexity_of_Concept_Languages","215778535_On_the_complexity_of_the_instance_checking_problem_in_concept_languages_with_existential_quantification","213893905_Haskell_overloading_is_DEXPTIME-complete","3677438_Solving_linear_equations_over_polynomial_semirings","2796443_An_Application_of_Terminological_Logics_to_Case-based_Reasoning","2691180_Solving_Linear_Equations_Over_Polynomial_Semirings","2649994_Number_Restrictions_on_Complex_Roles_in_Description_Logics","2588229_Description_Logic_in_Practice_A_classic_Application","2581539_Deduction_in_Concept_Languages_From_Subsumption_to_Instance_Checking","2494288_LaSSIE_a_Knowledge-Based_Software_Information_System","2433292_Living_with_CLASSIC_When_and_How_to_Use_a_KL-ONE-Like_Language","2540855_Tree_Automata_Techniques_and_Applications_-_Chapter_5_Tree_Set_Automata","2401013_A_Terminological_Knowledge_Representation_System_with_Complete_Inference_Algorithms","2294447_Knowledge_Representation_in_Process_Engineering"]}
