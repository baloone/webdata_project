{"id":"273388342_Attack_Trees_with_Sequential_Conjunction","abstract":"We provide the first formal foundation of SAND attack trees which are a\npopular extension of the well-known attack trees. The SAND attack tree\nformalism increases the expressivity of attack trees by introducing the\nsequential conjunctive operator SAND. This operator enables the modeling of\nordered events.\nWe give a semantics to SAND attack trees by interpreting them as sets of\nseries-parallel graphs and propose a complete axiomatization of this semantics.\nWe define normal forms for SAND attack trees and a term rewriting system which\nallows identification of semantically equivalent trees. Finally, we formalize\nhow to quantitatively analyze SAND attack trees using attributes.","authors":["Ravi Jhawar","Barbara Kordy","Sjouke Mauw","Sasa Radomirovic"],"meta":["March 2015IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology 455","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-18467-8_23","SourcearXiv","Conference: IFIP International Information Security Conference"],"references":["313772274_A_scalable_approach_to_attack_graph_generation","279258555_A_Probabilistic_Framework_for_Security_Scenarios_with_Dependent_Actions","278745502_Towards_Synthesis_of_Attack_Trees_for_Supporting_Computer-Aided_Risk_Analysis","268018467_Attack-defense_trees","261860296_ADTool_Security_Analysis_with_Attack-Defense_Trees","307915731_Unified_Parametrizable_Attack_Tree","266752343_Term_rewriting_systems_Terese","263348972_Attack_countermeasure_trees_ACT_towards_unifying_the_constructs_of_attack_and_defense_trees","261874446_Time-Dependent_Analysis_of_Attacks","258818808_DAG-Based_Attack_and_Defense_Modeling_Don't_Miss_the_Forest_for_the_Attack_Trees"]}
