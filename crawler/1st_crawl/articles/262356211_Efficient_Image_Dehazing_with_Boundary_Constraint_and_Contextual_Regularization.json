{"id":"262356211_Efficient_Image_Dehazing_with_Boundary_Constraint_and_Contextual_Regularization","abstract":"Images captured in foggy weather conditions often suffer from bad visibility. In this paper, we propose an efficient regularization method to remove hazes from a single input image. Our method benefits much from an exploration on the inherent boundary constraint on the transmission function. This constraint, combined with a weighted L_1-norm based contextual regularization, is modeled into an optimization problem to estimate the unknown scene transmission. A quite efficient algorithm based on variable splitting is also presented to solve the problem. The proposed method requires only a few general assumptions and can restore a high-quality haze-free image with faithful colors and fine image details. Experimental results on a variety of haze images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","authors":["Gaofeng Meng","Ying Wang","Jiangyong Duan","Shiming Xiang"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICCV.2013.82","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["224167102_Improved_Visibility_of_Road_Scene_Images_under_Heterogeneous_Fog","224136067_Factorizing_Scene_Albedo_and_Depth_from_a_Single_Foggy_Image","221362812_Visibility_in_bad_weather_from_a_single_image","221209704_Improved_Single_Image_Dehazing_Using_Geometry","221110862_Fast_Visibility_Restoration_from_a_Single_Color_or_Gray_Level_Image","220745423_A_Fast_Semi-Inverse_Approach_to_Detect_and_Remove_the_Haze_from_a_Single_Image","220184290_Edge-preserving_decompositions_for_multi-scale_tone_and_detail_manipulation","220182411_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior","269126154_Contrast_restoration_of_weather_degraded_images","268585686_Deep_photo","234794112_Deep_Photo_Model-Based_Photograph_Enhancement_and_Viewing","220184320_Single_image_dehazing","51623717_An_Investigation_of_Dehazing_Effects_on_Image_and_Video_Coding","4246249_Blind_Haze_Separation","3940554_Instant_dehazing_of_images_using_polarization","3193559_Contrast_restoration_of_weather_degraded_images"]}
