{"id":"224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","abstract":"Algorithms are presented for 1) converting a state graph describing the behavior of an automaton to a regular expression describing the behavior of the same automaton (section 2), and 2) for converting a regular expression into a state graph (sections 3 and 4). These algorithms are justified by theorems, and examples are given. The first section contains a brief introduction to state graphs and the regular-expression language.","authors":["R. F.
