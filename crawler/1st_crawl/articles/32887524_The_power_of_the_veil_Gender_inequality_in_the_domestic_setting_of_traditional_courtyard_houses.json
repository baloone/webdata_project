{"id":"32887524_The_power_of_the_veil_Gender_inequality_in_the_domestic_setting_of_traditional_courtyard_houses","abstract":"This paper is an investigation of the spatial configuration of the courtyard house and the way this\nconfiguration reflects the social relationships between the people who inhabit the house and their\nvisitors. Specific attention is being paid to the constraints that society places on its members, especially\nthe privacy for the women of the family and the differences in the use of space between the two genders.\nThis investigation has been carried out using Space Syntax both as a theoretical and analytical\nframework to analyze the spatial configuration of the courtyard house in order to establish, confirm and\nclarify the underlying social structure that gave rise to this type of house, thus linking the social and\nspatial orders together.","authors":["Reem Zako"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":[]}
