{"id":"310368166_Knowledge_structure_evolution_and_evaluation_method_in_computer_science","abstract":"When educators and learners choose wide thick or sophisticated knowledge system, they face judgment problem:teaching core concepts in synchronization with the times and understanding the subject of global knowledge map. This work collects the curriculum outline guides of ACM/IEEE from 1991 to 2014. We start from the smallest component of knowledge unit, and we analyze now the core area and the concept change after the concept of computer science in the past 60 years has been increased from 591 to 5 824. The analysis in this work shows that the growth rate of the subject concept slowed down from 354% to 1.41% in 2013 and 2014; knowledge areas expanded from 9 to 19; and knowledge units expanded from 10 to 18. The main contributions of this work are as follows. We collect the data and establish the dataset. This is the first time to use the knowledge framework of curricula, and in three aspects we reveal the evolution law of computer science; and then we have set up an online platform.","authors":["Libo Zhang","Fei Zhang","Tiejian Luo"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.7523/j.issn.2095-6134.2016.06.017","Project: Learnning path"],"references":[]}
