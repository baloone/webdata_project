{"id":"316482986_Alpha_Logarithmic_Transformed_Family_of_Distributions_with_Application","abstract":"In this paper, a new three-parameter distribution, called alpha logarithmic transformed\nGeneralized Exponential Distribution (ALTGE) is proposed. The distribution has simple\nclosed forms pdf and cdf. Various properties of the proposed distribution, including explicit\nexpressions for the moments, quantiles, moment generating function, mean deviation about\nthe mean and median, mean residual life, Bonferroni curve, Lorenz curve, Gini index, RÂ´enyi\nentropy, stochastic ordering and order statistics are derived. It appears to be a distribution\ncapable of allowing monotonically increasing, decreasing, bathtub and upside-down bathtub\nshaped hazard rates depending on its parameters. The maximum likelihood estimators of\nthe unknown parameters cannot be obtained in explicit forms, and they have to be obtained\nby solving non-linear equations only. The asymptotic confidence intervals for the parameters\nare also obtained based on asymptotic variance covariance matrix. Finally, two empirical\napplications of the new model to real data are presented for illustrative purposes.","authors":["Sanku Dey","Mazen Nassar","Devendra Kumar"],"meta":["April 2017","Project: none of them"],"references":["307772473_An_Extended_Pareto_Distribution","304356435_A_New_Method_for_Generating_Distributions_with_an_Application_to_Exponential_Distribution","303522308_A_New_Method_of_Proposing_Distribution_and_Its_Application_to_Real_Data","281437475_Marshall-Olkin_generalized_exponential_distribution","280125764_The_Gumbel-Lomax_Distribution_Properties_and_Applications","269630738_The_Odd_Generalized_Exponential_Family_of_Distributions_with_Applications","261302420_Renyi_entropy_in_identification_of_cardiac_autonomic_neuropathy_in_diabetes","259043455_TRANSMUTED_EXPONENTIATED_EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION","258387317_A_Family_of_Lifetime_Distributions","257879693_Estimating_the_number_of_components_of_a_multicomponent_nonstationary_signal_using_the_short-term_time-frequency_Renyi_entropy","257810157_A_new_method_for_generating_families_of_continuous_distributions","257758380_Signal_Segmentation_in_Time-Frequency_Plane_Using_Renyi_Entropy_-_Application_in_Seismic_Signal_Processing","238865380_Beta-normal_distribution_and_its_application","232897376_Modeling_actuarial_data_with_a_composite_lognormal-Pareto_model","26461812_Depression_and_cognition_New_insights_from_the_Lorenz_curve_and_the_Gini_index","23991286_Bivariate_generalized_exponential_distribution","4742517_A_Constructive_Representation_of_Univariate_Skewed_Distributions","1774177_The_beta_generalized_exponential_distribution","351035605_A_New_Generalization_of_the_Moyal_Distribution","324636617_Tables_of_Integrals_Series_and_Products","314857992_A_New_Extension_of_Generalized_Exponential_Distribution_with_Application_to_Ozone_Data","314733629_Statistical_Models_and_Methods_for_Lifetime_Data","302557879_Further_results_on_a_class_of_distributions_which_includes_the_normal_ones","292692934_Generalized_exponential_distribution_existing_results_and_some_recent_developments","269629223_Marshall-Olkin_Generalized_Exponential_Distribution","268659530_Extreme_value_distributions_Theory_and_applications","268552467_Statistical_Size_Distributions_in_Economics_and_Actuarial_Sciences","265331203_The_beta_generalized_Pareto_distribution","258516023_Methods_for_generating_families_of_continuous_distribution_in_the_recent_decades","254788413_A_Quantile_Alternative_for_Kurtosis","246275543_A_Class_of_Distributions_Which_Includes_the_Normal_Ones","245297738_Use_of_the_Lorenz_Curve_to_Quantify_Statistical_Nonuniformity_of_Sediment_Transport_Rate","242511716_Methods_of_measuring_concentration_of_wealth","233530435_Mathematics_of_statistics","233462746_Some_Results_for_Beta_Frechet_Distribution","228575816_Development_of_hierarchy_theory_for_digraphs_using_concentration_theory_based_on_a_new_type_of_Lorenz_curve","224260693_High-Resolution_Scalar_Quantization_With_Renyi_Entropy_Constraint","45894425_Forest_Density_Estimation","26836514_Applying_the_Lorenz_curve_to_disease_risk_to_optimize_health_benefits_under_cost_constraints","24031359_Lorenz_Curve_and_Gini_Coefficient_Novel_tools_for_analysing_seasonal_variation_of_environmental_radon_gas","5207388_A_new_method_for_adding_a_parameter_to_a_family_of_distributions_with_application_to_the_exponential_and_Weibull_families","3151808_Exponentiated_Weibull_family_for_analyzing_bathtub_failure-rate_data"]}
