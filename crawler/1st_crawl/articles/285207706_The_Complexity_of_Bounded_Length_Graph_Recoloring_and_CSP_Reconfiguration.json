{"id":"285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","abstract":"In the first part of this work we study the following question: Given two \\(k\\)-colorings \\(\\alpha \\) and \\(\\beta \\) of a graph \\(G\\) on \\(n\\) vertices and an integer \\(\\ell \\), can \\(\\alpha \\) be modified into \\(\\beta \\) by recoloring vertices one at a time, while maintaining a \\(k\\)-coloring throughout and using at most \\(\\ell \\) such recoloring steps? This problem is weakly PSPACE-hard for every constant \\(k \\ge 4\\). We show that the problem is also strongly NP-hard for every constant \\(k \\ge 4\\) and W[1]-hard (but in XP) when parameterized only by \\(\\ell \\). On the positive side, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by \\(k+\\ell \\). In fact, we show that the more general problem of \\(\\ell \\)-length bounded reconfiguration of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by \\(k+\\ell +r\\), where \\(r\\) is the maximum constraint arity and \\(k\\) is the maximum domain size. We show that for parameter \\(\\ell \\), the latter problem is W[2]-hard, even for \\(k=2\\). Finally, if \\(p\\) denotes the number of variables with different values in the two given assignments, we show that the problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by \\(\\ell -p\\), even for \\(k=2\\) and \\(r=3\\).","authors":["Paul Bonsma","Amer Mouawad","Naomi Nishimura","Venkatesh Raman"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-13524-3_10","Conference: International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation"],"references":["323098261_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","260295061_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220194396_Connectedness_of_the_graph_of_vertex-colourings","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","315307386_Graph_Theory","291265768_Extremal_Graph_Theory","267373223_Mixing_Graph_Colourings","264963171_The_height_and_length_of_colour_switching","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","241010110_Standortplanung_mit_Blick_auf_Online-Strategien","240024329_Graph_Theory_Electronic_Edition_2000","225035759_Graph_Theory","224836520_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","222569763_Machine-based_methods_in_parameterized_complexity_theory","222057470_Some_Simplified_NP-Complete_Graph_Problems","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220148404_Shortest_paths_between_shortest_paths","46585526_The_Complexity_of_Rerouting_Shortest_Paths"]}
