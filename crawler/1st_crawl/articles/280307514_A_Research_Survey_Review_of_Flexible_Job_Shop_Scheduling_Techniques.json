{"id":"280307514_A_Research_Survey_Review_of_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling_Techniques","abstract":"In the last 25 years, extensive research has been carried out addressing the flexible job shop scheduling (JSS) problem. A variety of techniques ranging from exact methods to hybrid techniques have been used in this research. The paper aims at presenting the development of flexible JSS and a consolidated survey of various techniques that have been employed since 1990 for problem resolution. The paper comprises evaluation of publications and research methods used in various research papers. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on performed survey results.","authors":["Imran Ali Chaudhry","Abid A Khan"],"meta":["August 2015International Transactions in Operational
