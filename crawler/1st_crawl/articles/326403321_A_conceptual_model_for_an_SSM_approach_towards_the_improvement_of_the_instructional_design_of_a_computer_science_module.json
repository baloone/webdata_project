It remains difficult for students to learn how to program due to various challenges students experience which includes social and technical difficulties. The aim of this study is to develop a conceptual model for the improvement of the instructional design of a programming module in a computer science program using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). This study applies the SSM cycle which will enquire the current instructional design in the programming module, formulate a relevant activity model showcasing a specific worldview (from a lecturer's perspective), using the model to further enquire the real-world situation and finally find changes that are both desirable and feasible based on the deeper understanding of the perceived problematic situation, i.e. learning how to program.","authors":["Sun√© van der Linde","M.
