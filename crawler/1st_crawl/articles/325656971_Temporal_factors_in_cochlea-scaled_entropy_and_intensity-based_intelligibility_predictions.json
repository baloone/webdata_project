{"id":"325656971_Temporal_factors_in_cochlea-scaled_entropy_and_intensity-based_intelligibility_predictions","abstract":"Cochlea-scaled entropy (CSE) was proposed as a signal-based metric for automatic detection of speech regions most important for intelligibility, but its proposed superiority over traditional linguistic and psychoacoustical characterisations was not subsequently confirmed. This paper shows that the CSE concept is closely related to intensity and as such captures similar speech regions. However, a slight but significant advantage of a CSE over an intensity-based characterisation was observed, associated with a time difference between the two metrics, suggesting that the CSE index may capture dynamical properties of the speech signal crucial for intelligibility.","authors":["Vincent Aubanel","Martin Cooke","Chris Davis","Jeesun Kim"],"meta":["June 2018The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 143(6):EL443-EL448","DOI:10.1121/1.5041468"],"references":["311905402_Comparing_the_perceptual_contributions_of_cochlear-scaled_entropy_and_speech_level","263352347_Fitting_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Models_Using_lme4","232497075_Perceptual_centers_P-Centers","230860158_Cochlea-scaled_entropy_predicts_intelligibility_of_Mandarin_Chinese_sentences","224911969_Contributions_of_cochlea-scaled_entropy_and_consonant-vowel_boundaries_to_prediction_of_speech_intelligibility_in_noise","44691308_Cochlea-scaled_entropy_not_consonants_vowels_or_time_best_predicts_speech_intelligibility","320243860_The_MAVA_corpus","319597122_Speech_intelligibility_is_best_predicted_by_intensity_not_cochlea-scaled_entropy","272258603_Perceptual_centers_in_speech_An_acoustic_analysis","265414192_IEEE_Recommended_Pratice_for_Speech_Quality_Measurements","26702924_Perceptual_contributions_of_the_consonant-vowel_boundary_to_sentence_intelligibility","16046505_The_deterioration_of_hearing_with_age_Frequency_selectivity_the_critical_ratio_the_audiogram_and_speech_threshold","5370894_Simultaneous_Inference_in_General_Parametric_Models","2782742_Rhythmic_constraints_on_stress_timing_in_English"]}
