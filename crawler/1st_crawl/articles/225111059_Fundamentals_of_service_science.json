{"id":"225111059_Fundamentals_of_service_science","abstract":"Service systems are value-co-creation configurations of people, technology, value propositionsconnecting internal and external\nservice systems, and shared information (e.g., language, laws, measures, and methods). Service science is the study of service\nsystems, aiming to create a basis for systematicservice innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding\nwith business andtechnological understanding to categorize and explain the many types of service systems that exist as wellas\nhow service systems interact and evolve to co-create value. The goal is to apply scientific understandingto advance our ability\nto design, improve, and scale service systems. To make progress, we think servicedominantlogic provides just the right perspective,\nvocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory ofservice systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction.\nSimply put, service-dominant logicmay be the philosophical foundation of service science, and the service system may be its\nbasic theoreticalconstruct.\nKeywordsService science-Service systems-Service-dominant logic","authors":["Paul P.
