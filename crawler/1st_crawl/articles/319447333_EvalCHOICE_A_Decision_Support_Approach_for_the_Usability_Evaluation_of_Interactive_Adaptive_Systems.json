{"id":"319447333_EvalCHOICE_A_Decision_Support_Approach_for_the_Usability_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Adaptive_Systems","abstract":"Successful usability evaluation of interactive adaptive systems requires the use of appropriate methods. Different usability evaluation methods exist in the literature. These methods can be applied in association with the individual layers, as well as evaluation as a whole. In each situation, it is essential to apply the appropriate evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel decision support approach called EvalCHOICE. It guides evaluators in the choice of appropriate usability evaluation methods for individual layers and the adaptive system as a whole. Our proposal is applied to determine the suitable evaluation methods for a given Web-based adaptive system in the field of transport.","authors":["Amira Dhouib","Abdelwaheb Trabelsi","Christophe Kolski","Mahmoud Neji"],"meta":["September 2017Procedia Computer Science 112:864-873","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.086"],"references":["305869646_A_classification_and_comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems","242371833_A_framework_for_human_factors_evaluation","239612585_Proposed_Evaluation_Framework_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Systems","221622202_Designing_and_Redesigning_an_Affective_Interface_for_an_Adaptive_Museum_Guide","221413291_ELM-ART_An_intelligent_tutoring_system_on_world_wide_web","221054590_Usability_Planner_A_Tool_to_Support_the_Process_of_Selecting_Usability_Methods","220800390_Usability_Engineering_for_the_Adaptive_Web","220116360_Layered_evaluation_of_interactive_adaptive_systems_Framework_and_formative_methods","41221808_Inferring_an_ELECTRE_Tri_model_from_assignment_examples","2567507_The_Benefits_of_Layered_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Applications_and_Services","324315898_Multicriteria_Methodology_for_Decision_Aiding","306925272_An_approach_for_the_selection_of_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems_using_analytic_hierarchy_process","299822588_The_outranking_approach_and_the_foundations_of_ELECTRE_methods","295378689_Human-Computer_Interactions_in_Transport","238122690_Heuristic_Evaluation_In_Usability_Inspection_Methods","226777321_Layered_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Applications_and_Services","222703391_Steps_to_take_before_intelligent_user_interfaces_become_real","220605070_Understanding_and_Dealing_With_Usability_Side_Effects_of_Intelligent_Processing","43091763_Using_assignment_examples_to_infer_weights_for_ELECTRE_TRI_method_Some_experimental_results"]}
