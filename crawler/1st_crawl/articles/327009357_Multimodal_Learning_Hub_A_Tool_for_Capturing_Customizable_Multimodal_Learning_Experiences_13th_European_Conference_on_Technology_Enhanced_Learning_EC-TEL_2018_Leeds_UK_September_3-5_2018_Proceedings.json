Learning, however, does not necessarily only occur when the learner is directly interacting with such systems. With the use of sensors, it is possible to collect data from learners and their environment ubiquitously, therefore expanding the use cases of Learning Analytics. For this reason, we developed the Multimodal Learning Hub (MLH), a system designed to enhance learning in ubiquitous learning scenarios, by collecting and integrating multimodal data from customizable configurations of ubiquitous data providers. In this paper, we describe the MLH and report on the results of tests where we explored its reliability to integrate multimodal data.","authors":["Jan Schneider","Daniele Di Mitri","Bibeg Limbu","Hendrik Drachsler"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_4","In book: Lifelong Technology-Enhanced Learning (pp.45-58)","Project: Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training (WEKIT)"],"references":["326559074_From_signals_to_knowledge_A_conceptual_model_for_multimodal_learning_analytics","319473017_Affordances_for_Capturing_and_Re-enacting_Expert_Performance_with_Wearables","309154985_Situating_Multimodal_Learning_Analytics","295094610_The_Evolution_of_Research_on_Digital_Education","282641747_Metalogue_A_Multiperspective_Multimodal_Dialogue_System_with_Metacognitive_Abilities_for_Highly_Adaptive_and_Flexible_Dialogue_Management","279840056_MACH_My_automated_conversation_coach","272661831_Sensor_Mania_The_Internet_of_Things_Wearable_Computing_Objective_Metrics_and_the_Quantified_Self_20","272157080_Augmenting_the_Senses_A_Review_on_Sensor-Based_Learning_Support","266653654_Multimodal_learning_analytics","260265661_Deconstructing_Disengagement_Analyzing_Learner_Subpopulations_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","259969289_Penetrating_the_Fog_Analytics_in_Learning_and_Education","254462830_Course_signals_at_Purdue_Using_learning_analytics_to_increase_student_success","221517099_Off-Task_Behavior_in_the_Cognitive_Tutor_Classroom_When_Students_Game_The_System","323864893_The_teacher_in_the_loop_customizing_multimodal_learning_analytics_for_blended_learning","323864798_Disengagement_matters_identifying_efficacious_learning_practices_with_multimodal_learning_analytics","323862113_The_RAP_system_automatic_feedback_of_oral_presentation_skills_using_multimodal_analysis_and_low-cost_sensors","310483340_Can_You_Help_Me_with_My_Pitch_Studying_a_Tool_for_Real-Time_Automated_Feedback","305657770_A_Multimodal_System_for_Public_Speaking_with_Real_Time_Feedback","258182775_The_Power_of_Feedback","248940169_Public_speaking_performance_improvement_as_a_function_of_information_processing_in_immediate_and_delayed_feedback_interventions","229070251_Beyond_the_channel_A_literature_review_on_ambient_displays_for_learning","35033915_An_examination_of_the_effectiveness_of_in-class_instructive_feedback_for_teachers_learning_specific_teaching_behaviors"]}
