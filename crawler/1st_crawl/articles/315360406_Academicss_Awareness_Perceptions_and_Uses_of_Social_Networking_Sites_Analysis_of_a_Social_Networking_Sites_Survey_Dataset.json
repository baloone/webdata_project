{"id":"315360406_Academicss_Awareness_Perceptions_and_Uses_of_Social_Networking_Sites_Analysis_of_a_Social_Networking_Sites_Survey_Dataset","abstract":"This paper presents an independent analysis of a survey designed and administered by Nature Publishing Group. The full dataset has been made publicly available via Figshare (Nature Publishing Group, 2014). While results related to selected questions and sites were published in a recent article (Van Noorden, 2014), this paper provides a more comprehensive analysis of the full quantitative dataset. In summary, awareness of academic social networking sites is relatively low compared to generic services, and for some sites varies according to job position and discipline. Although it is not a specifically academic social networking site, Twitter demonstrates the highest levels of use for a range of active academic purposes amongst those who use it professionally. Significant differences according to job position and discipline were found in the perceived usefulness of social networking online for several professional purposes.","authors":["Katy Jordan"],"meta":["January 2014SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2507318"],"references":["267642307_Academics_and_their_online_networks_Exploring_the_role_of_academic_social_networking_sites","264798361_Online_collaboration_Scientists_and_the_social_network"]}
