{"id":"340483087_Multi-View_Vehicle_Detection_Based_on_Fusion_Part_Model_With_Active_Learning","abstract":"Computer vision-based vehicle detection techniques are widely used in real-world applications. However, most of these techniques aim to detect only single-view vehicles, and their performances are easily affected by partial occlusion. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-view vehicle detection system that uses a part model to address the partial occlusion problem and the high variance between all types of vehicles. There are three features in this paper; firstly, different from Deformable Part Model, the construction of part models in this paper is visual and can be replaced at any time. Secondly, this paper proposes some new part models for detection of vehicles according to the appearance analysis of a large number of modern vehicles by the active learning algorithm. Finally, this paper proposes the method that contains color transformation along with the Bayesian rule to filter out the background to accelerate the detection time and increase accuracy. The proposed method outperforms other methods on given dataset.","authors":["Dong Lin Li","Mukesh Prasad","Chih-Ling Liu","Chin-Teng Lin"],"meta":["April 2020IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2020.2982804"],"references":[]}
