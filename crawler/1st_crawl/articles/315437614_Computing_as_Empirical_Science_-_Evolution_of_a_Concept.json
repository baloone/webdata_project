{"id":"315437614_Computing_as_Empirical_Science_-_Evolution_of_a_Concept","abstract":"This article presents the evolution of philosophical and methodological considerations concerning empiricism in computer/computing science. In this study, we trace the most important current events in the history of reflection on computing. The forerunners of Artificial Intelligence H.A. Simon and A. Newell in their paper Computer Science As Empirical Inquiry (1975) started these considerations. Later the concept of empirical computer science was developed by S.S. Shapiro, P. Wegner, A.H. Eden and P.J. Denning. They showed various empirical aspects of computing. This led to a view of the science of computing (or science of information processing) - the science of general scope. Some interesting contemporary ways towards a generalized perspective on computations were also shown (e.g. natural computing).","authors":["Pawe≈Ç Polak"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1515/slgr-2016-0055","Project: Philosophy of computing - ontological and methodological issues"],"references":["311861937_Computing_Nature","270882655_Proby_aplikacji_paradygmatu_ucielesnionego_umyslu_w_tworzeniu_sztucznej_inteligencji","257759894_Alan_Turing's_Legacy_Info-Computational_Philosophy_of_Nature","257759595_Typologies_of_Computation_and_Computational_Models","324459442_Computer_Science_and_its_Relation_to_Mathematics","321570330_Program_Verification_Fundamental_Issues_in_Computer_Science","319394519_Computer_Science_as_empirical_inquiry_Symbols_and_search","303420530_A_computable_universe_Understanding_and_exploring_nature_as_computation","281797053_A_Computable_Universe_Understanding_and_Exploring_Nature_as_Computation","264953204_Program_verification_Fundamental_issues_in_computer_science"]}
