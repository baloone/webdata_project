{"id":"338868217_Describing_Comparing_and_Analysing_Digital_Urban_Heritage_Tools_A_Methodology_Designed_with_a_Multidisciplinary_Approach","abstract":"Urban cultural heritage is taking full advantage of digital technologies. This can be seen in the great number of digital tools for representing and interacting with cultural heritage (digital urban heritage tools). These tools do not only display heritage, but also allow users to contribute with their own data (knowledge, memories, documents, etc.). In this article, we present and apply a methodology for describing, analysing and comparing digital urban heritage tools that combine at least two of the following aspects: digital representation of the city, multimedia data documenting the city, and participatory functionalities. Firstly, we introduce this methodology, named DHAL (Digital urban Heritage tools AnaLysis), and the multidisciplinary process established for building it. We then show its application in the context our project (Fab-Pat) by testing it on twelve tools. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the methodology’s advantages and potential avenues.","authors":["Vincent Jaillot","Manon Istasse","Sylvie Servigne","Gilles Gesquière"],"meta":["June 2020Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 17(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.daach.2020.e00135","Project: Virtual City - Liris Lab CNRS Univ.
