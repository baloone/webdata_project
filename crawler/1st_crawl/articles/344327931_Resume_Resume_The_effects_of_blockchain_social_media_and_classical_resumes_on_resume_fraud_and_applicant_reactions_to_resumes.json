{"id":"344327931_Resume_Resume_The_effects_of_blockchain_social_media_and_classical_resumes_on_resume_fraud_and_applicant_reactions_to_resumes","abstract":"Resumes are a ubiquitous first hurdle in hiring processes. Applicants' resume fraud behavior and applicants' reactions to selection methods can therefore influence all subsequent selection stages. In addition to classical resumes, professional social media resumes and blockchain resumes emerge as alternative resume formats. In two online studies, this paper investigates whether differing characteristics of classical, social media, and blockchain resumes affect applicant fraud behavior and reactions (e.g., perceived fairness) to the resume formats. We further investigate if differing reactions consequently influence perceived organizational attractiveness of the hiring organization using the respective resume format. In a between-subjects design, Study 1 examined potential applicants' resume fraud behavior and reactions towards the resume formats. Study 2 parallels Study 1 in a sample of actual human resource managers. In both studies, the resume format had negligible effects on expected fraud behavior, with participants expecting only slightly more fraud behavior in social media resumes. In both samples, the novel resume formats triggered less favorable reactions and led to lower organizational attractiveness, calling for caution when considering novel resume formats for hiring. Finally, exploratory findings revealed that the processes through which the novel resume formats negatively affected organizational attractiveness differed between applicants and human resource managers.","authors":["Pia V.
