{"id":"287996327_Canonical_Dynamics_Equilibrium_Phase-Space_Distributions","abstract":"Nose has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with VÂ¹D/ in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta p/sub s/ and p/sub v/. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, p/sub x/, V, epsilon-dot, and zeta, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables epsilon-dot and zeta act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.","authors":["William Graham Hoover"],"meta":["April 1985Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 31(3):1695","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.31.1695"],"references":["256142641_Isothermal_Molecular_Dynamics_Calculations_for_Liquid_Salts","243465850_Argon_Shear_Viscosity_via_a_Lennard-Jones_Potential_with_Equilibrium_and_Nonequilibrium_Molecular_Dynamics","220044061_Molecular-Dynamics_with_Coupling_to_An_External_Bath","252521959_High-Strain-Rate_Plastic_Flow_Studied_via_Nonequilibrium_Molecular_Dynamics","243470657_Structural_Transitions_in_Superionic_Conductors","241611708_Computer_''experiment''_for_nonlinear_thermodynamics_of_Couette_flow","234953941_Reply_to_''Comment_on_Extensions_of_the_molecular_dynamics_simulation_method_II_Isothermal_systems''","233308038_A_Molecular_Dynamics_Method_for_Simulations_in_the_Canonical_Ensemble","224877193_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation_at_Constant_Pressure_andor_Temperature","220043979_A_Unified_Formulation_of_the_Constant_Temperature_Molecular_Dynamics_Method"]}
