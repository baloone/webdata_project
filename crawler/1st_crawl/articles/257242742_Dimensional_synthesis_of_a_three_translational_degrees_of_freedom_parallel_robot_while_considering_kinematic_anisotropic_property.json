{"id":"257242742_Dimensional_synthesis_of_a_three_translational_degrees_of_freedom_parallel_robot_while_considering_kinematic_anisotropic_property","abstract":"By taking the Delta robot as the object of study, this paper deals with the methodology of the dimensional synthesis of the three translational degrees of freedom parallel robot while considering the kinematic anisotropic property. The velocity transmission index is employed as the objective function of the optimization design. The physical meaning of the velocity transmission index is the maximum of the input angular velocity when the moving platform translates with an assigned velocity. The determinant of the direct kinematic Jacobian matrix, the ratio of the machine volume to that of the desired workspace and the difference between the radius of the base and the radius of the moving platform are adopted as the constraints for the dimensional synthesis in order to make the Delta robot have a good transmission behavior between the distal links, keep far away from the direct kinematic singular configuration, not to be a very tall and slender configuration, achieve the desired performance without large dimension and big building cost. The example of the dimensional synthesis of the Delta robot is presented in the simulation while considering the maximum velocity requirements for the moving platform along the respective direction parallel to the x axis, y axis and z axis are varied. The conclusions are provided at the end of the paper.","authors":["Yongjie Zhao"],"meta":["February 2013Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
