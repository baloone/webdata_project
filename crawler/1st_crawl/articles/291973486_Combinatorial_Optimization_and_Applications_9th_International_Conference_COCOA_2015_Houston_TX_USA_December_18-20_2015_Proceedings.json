We prove that for axis-parallel unit squares the hitting set and set cover problems are \\({\\mathsf {NP}}\\)-complete, whereas the piercing set and independent set problems are in \\({\\mathsf {P}}\\). For axis-parallel rectangles, we prove that the piercing set problem is \\({\\mathsf {NP}}\\)-complete, which solves an open question from Correa et al. [Discrete & Computational Geometry (2015) [3]]. Further, we give a \\({n^{O({\\lceil }\\log c{\\rceil }+1)}}\\) time exact algorithm for the independent set problem with axis-parallel squares, where n is the number of squares and side lengths of the squares vary from 1 to c. We also prove that when the given objects are unit-height rectangles, both the hitting set and set cover problems are \\({\\mathsf {NP}}\\)-complete. For the same set of objects, we prove that the independent set problem can be solved in polynomial time.","authors":["Apurva Mudgal","Supantha Pandit"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26626-8_10","Chapter: Covering, Hitting, Piercing and Packing Rectangles Intersecting an Inclined LinePublisher: Springer International PublishingEditors: Lu, Zaixin and Kim, Donghyun and Wu, Weili and Li, Wei and Du, Ding-Zhu"],"references":["259135786_Approximating_hitting_sets_of_axis-parallel_rectangles_intersecting_a_monotone_curve","268694622_Approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_independent_set_of_a_unit_disk_graph","267382536_The_Within-Strip_Discrete_Unit_Disk_Cover_Problem","260490196_Independent_and_Hitting_Sets_of_Rectangles_Intersecting_a_Diagonal_Line_Algorithms_and_Complexity","259135781_Exact_algorithms_and_APX-hardness_results_for_geometric_packing_and_covering_problems","223145998_A_weighted_min-max_relation_for_intervals","221462647_PTAS_for_Weighted_Set_Cover_on_Unit_Squares","220618236_Planar_Formulae_and_Their_Uses","220222257_The_Rectilinear_Steiner_Tree_Problem_is_NP-Complete","1880314_The_Problem_of_Compatible_Representatives"]}
