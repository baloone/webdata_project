{"id":"332699887_Planning_and_Conducting_Mixed_Methods_Studies_in_Mathematics_Educational_Research","abstract":"In this chapter, central ideas of Mixed Methods Research are presented in which qualitative and quantitative research methods are combined or integrated. In addition to the explanation of common Mixed Methods terminology, the chapter provides an overview of the most important aspects that must be reflected in the planning and conduction of a mixed-methodological research project. On the basis of considerations on the nature of the research object and specific conditions of mathematics education research, methodological aspects of the research question, research design and data analysis are described. The chapter concludes with considerations on the challenges of Mixed Methods, as well as recommendations on the step-by-step approach to a Mixed Methods Research project.","authors":["Nils Buchholtz"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-15636-7_6","In book: Compendium for Early Career Researchers in Mathematics Education (pp.131-152)Chapter: 6Publisher: Springer","Project: Mixed Methods in Mathematics Education"],"references":["318228078_How_to_Construct_a_Mixed_Methods_Research_Design","317722030_Mixed_Methods_-_Stand_der_Debatte_und_aktuelle_Problemlagen","329704681_Integrating_Analyses_in_Mixed_Methods_Research","324479332_Ingenierie_didactique_quel_role_dans_la_recherche_didactique_aujourd'hui","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","321274607_Mixed_methodology_Combining_qualitative_and_quantitative_approaches","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","314409049_A_Postmodern_Perspective_on_Research_in_Mathematics_Education","312775657_The_Combination_of_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_Methods_in_Mathematics_Education_A_Mixed_Methods_Study_on_the_Development_of_the_Professional_Knowledge_of_Teachers","312465569_Toward_a_conceptual_framework_of_mixed-method_evaluation_designs"]}
