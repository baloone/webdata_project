{"id":"301390626_Randomized_Addition_of_Sensitive_Attributes_for_l-diversity","abstract":"When a data holder wants to share databases that contain personal attributes, individual privacy needs to be\nconsidered. Existing anonymization techniques, such as l-diversity, remove identifiers and generalize quasi-identifiers\n(QIDs) from the database to ensure that adversaries cannot specify each individualâ€™s sensitive attributes.\nUsually, the database is anonymized based on one-size-fits-all measures. Therefore, it is possible\nthat several QIDs that a data user focuses on are all generalized, and the anonymized database has no value\nfor the user. Moreover, if a database does not satisfy the eligibility requirement, we cannot anonymize it by\nexisting methods. In this paper, we propose a new technique for l-diversity, which keeps QIDs unchanged and\nrandomizes sensitive attributes of each individual so that data users can analyze it based on QIDs they focus\non and does not require the eligibility requirement. Through mathematical analysis and simulations, we will\nprove that our proposed method for l-diversity can result in a better tradeoff between privacy and utility of the\nanonymized database.","authors":["Yuichi Sei","Akihiko Ohsuga"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.5220/0005058203500360","Conference: International Conference on Security and Cryptography"],"references":[]}
