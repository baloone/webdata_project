{"id":"322059955_Applying_Software_Engineering_Standards_in_Very_Small_Entities_From_Startups_to_Grownups","abstract":"Very small entities (VSEs) are organizations with up to 25 people. The ISO/IEC 29110 series of standards and guides target VSEs with little or no experience or expertise in selecting the appropriate processes from lifecycle standards and tailoring them to a project’s needs. This article gives an overview of ISO/IEC 29110, some examples of VSEs that have implemented it, and those implementations’ results.","authors":["Claude Y.
