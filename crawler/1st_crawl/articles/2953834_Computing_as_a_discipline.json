{"id":"2953834_Computing_as_a_discipline","abstract":"A summary is given of a report that had the following goals: to describe computer science in a way that emphasizes fundamental questions and significant accomplishments; to propose a teaching paradigm for computer science that conforms to traditional scientific standards, emphasizes the development of competence in the field, and harmoniously integrates theory, experimentation, and design; and to give a detailed example of an introductory course sequence in computer science that is based on the curriculum model and the disciplinary description. This task was extended to encompass both computer science and computer engineering. This summary encompasses: paradigms; the role of programming; a description of computing; a curriculum model; an introductory sequence; laboratories; and accreditation","authors":["Peter Denning","Douglas E.
