{"id":"248321322_Vertex_Cover_Might_be_Hard_to_Approximate_to_within_2","abstract":"Based on a conjecture regarding the power of unique 2-prover-1-round games presented in (Khot02), we show that vertex cover is hard to approximate within any constant factor better than 2. We actually show a stronger result, namely, based on the same conjecture, vertex cover on k-uniform hypergraphs is hard to approximate within any constant factor better than k.","authors":["Subhash Khot","Oded Regev"],"meta":["January 2003computational complexity"],"references":["226660449_An_approximate_zero-one_law","4004036_Proving_integrality_gaps_without_knowing_the_linear_program","3880865_Hardness_of_approximate_hypergraph_coloring","2834088_Non-Approximability_Results_for_Optimization_Problems_on_Bounded_Degree_Instances"]}
