{"id":"323384444_Cloud_Computing_Management_Platform_of_Human_Resource_Based_on_Mobile_Communication_Technology","abstract":"For studying the cloud computing management platform of human resources, according to the plight of group enterprise human resource management research, a set of human resource management information system based on cloud computing technology is designed, which is used in various fields of group enterprise human resources management, such as personnel management, organization management, salary management, attendance management and so on. The results show that the group level human resource management information system based on cloud computing can help enterprises to complete the task of human resource management efficiently, which reduces the communication costs and improves the management efficiency. In addition, it achieves the group enterprise human resources data search of MapReduce engine under the framework of Hadoop, report data check and so on massive data computing task. In summary, it provides a cloud computing based group human resource management information system achieved based on JAVA programming language, and provides PC terminal, mobile terminal, flat terminal and other multi terminal operating platforms, which has high application value.","authors":["Zhengbao Lv","Zefu Tan","Qian Wang","Yanqiong Yang"],"meta":["September 2018Wireless Personal Communications 102(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-017-5195-y"],"references":["320622210_International_Sourcing_in_Finland_and_Sweden","307636677_An_Analysis_of_the_Cloud_Computing_Security_Problem","293329163_A_Survey_on_Resource_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Computing_Issues_and_Challenges","287974031_QoS-Aware_Autonomic_Resource_Management_in_Cloud_Computing_A_Systematic_Review","284810509_Information_security_management_needs_more_holistic_approach_A_literature_review","283236612_Integration_of_Cloud_computing_and_Internet_of_Things_A_survey","319965901_Implementing_Energy_Service_Automation_Using_Cloud_Technologies_and_Public_Communications_Networks","319487255_Factors_influencing_the_adoption_and_implementation_of_HRIS_applications_Are_they_similar","316736509_A_Rural_Lens_on_a_Research_Agenda_for_Intelligent_Infrastructure","308579627_Cloud-based_Activity-aaService_cyberphysical_framework_for_human_activity_monitoring_in_mobility","263504690_A_survey_and_taxonomy_on_energy_efficient_resource_allocation_techniques_for_cloud_computing_systems","255708329_An_analysis_of_the_cloud_computing_security_problem","282598893_ARMCO_Advanced_topics_in_resource_management_for_ubiquitous_cloud_computing_An_adaptive_approach"]}
