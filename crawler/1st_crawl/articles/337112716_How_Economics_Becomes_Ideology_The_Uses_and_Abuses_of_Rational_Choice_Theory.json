{"id":"337112716_How_Economics_Becomes_Ideology_The_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Rational_Choice_Theory","abstract":"Rational choice theory is often presented as essential to the truly scientific study of economics. To the contrary, in this paper I argue that when rational choice is treated as the key to a science of human agency, it ensnares economics in certain intractable dilemmas. Drawing on hermeneutic philosophy, I argue that economists need to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of rational choice theory. Failure to do so not only leads to self-defeating research goals, but also mires the discipline in an extreme form of free-market ideology. Economists thus have not only empirical but also ethical and political reasons for rejecting the mainstream deployment of rational choice. The paper concludes by briefly sketching a philosophically defensible use of rational choice in economics â€“ one that is more sensitive to the expressive dimensions of human agency and the limits of mechanistic causality.","authors":["Jason Blakely"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-26114-6_3","In book: Agency and Causal Explanation in Economics (pp.37-52)"],"references":["283200580_Relational_Psychoanalysis_as_Political_Resistance","270428975_The_Calculus_of_Consent","229923915_Theory_Stylized_Heuristic_or_Self-Fulfilling_Prophecy_The_Status_of_Rational_Choice_Theory_in_Public_Administration","26787679_Introducing_Incentives_in_the_Market_for_Live_and_Cadaveric_Organ_Donations"]}
