{"id":"342014371_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_are_we_considering_students'_socio-cultural_context","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Research to promote Computational Thinking (CT) has become frequent and carried out with the most different characteristics. Educational researchers argue that learning research needs to consider aspects of students' sociocultural context, regardless of what tools are being used and the contents involved. However, it is not known if, and to what extent, these aspects are being considered in research to promote CT. OBJECTIVE: This research investigates whether the initiatives to teach CT is recognizing and exploring aspects of students' socio-cultural context and, mainly, how this is occurring. METHOD: A systematic mapping of the literature covering a decade (2007-2017) of papers published in the main vehicles of Computer Science in Education and Computer Science, considering the Brazilian and international scenarios. RESULTS: Data indicates that students' socio-cultural context is not being considered in the reported activities, although there is evidence the scenario may be starting to change. CONCLUSION: Results show there are a growing concern and an evident effort by research to bring relevant elements of students' lives into conducted practices. However, it is still necessary to advance in terms of rigor for the characterization of these aspects and in a theoretical basis for informing research.","authors":["Júlia Ortiz","Carolina Moreira","Roberto Pereira"],"meta":["December 2019Journal on Computational Thinking (JCThink) 3(1)","DOI:10.14210/jcthink.v3.n1.p3","Project: Computando Meu Contexto: Projeto de Extensão"],"references":["328735627_Um_Mapeamento_Sistematico_Sobre_as_Iniciativas_para_Promover_o_Pensamento_Computacional","328643367_Teaching_Game_Design_and_Basic_Computing_Concepts_a_Democratic_Experiment_in_a_Socioeconomically_Vulnerable_Community","320964209_Tem_Ideia_na_Rede_Inserindo_o_Pensamento_Computacional_na_Rede_Municipal_de_Ensino","319287037_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_Using_Agile_Software_Engineering_Methods_A_Framework_for_Middle_Schools","309887849_Aplicacao_de_Robotica_na_Educacao_de_Forma_Gradual_para_o_Estimulo_do_Pensamento_Computacional","309883175_Pensamento_Computacional_na_Educacao_de_Jovens_e_Adultos_Licoes_Aprendidas","303806832_Using_Robotics_and_Game_Design_to_Enhance_Children's_Self-Efficacy_STEM_Attitudes_and_Computational_Thinking_Skills","321140236_Case_for_Integrating_Computational_Thinking_and_Science_in_a_Low-Resource_Setting","317989665_Computational_Thinking_in_Italian_Schools_Quantitative_Data_and_Teachers'_Sentiment_Analysis_after_Two_Years_of","316948804_Evaluation_and_Impact_of_a_Required_Computational_Thinking_Course_for_Architecture_Students"]}
