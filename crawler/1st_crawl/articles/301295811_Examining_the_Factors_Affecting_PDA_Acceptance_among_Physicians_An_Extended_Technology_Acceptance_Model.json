{"id":"301295811_Examining_the_Factors_Affecting_PDA_Acceptance_among_Physicians_An_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model","abstract":"This study aims at identifying the factors affecting the intention to use personal digital assistant (PDA) technology among physicians in Turkey using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A structural equation-modeling approach was used to identify the variables that significantly affect the intention to use PDA technology. The data were collected from 339 physicians in Turkey. Results indicated that 71% of the physicians' intention to use PDA technology is explained by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On comparing both, the perceived ease of use has the strongest effect, whereas the effect of perceived enjoyment on behavioral intention to use is found to be insignificant. This study concludes with the recommendations for managers and possible future research.","authors":["Ecem Basak","Cigdem Altin","Fethi Calisir"],"meta":["September 2015Journal of Healthcare
