{"id":"311699242_A_novel_approach_of_multimedia_instruction_applications_in_engineering_education","abstract":"Effective use of educational technology depends on knowledge of why and how to utilize technology to solve teaching and learning problems. The present study first conducts a systematic literature review of the limited studies undertaken on multimedia instruction applications for engineering education to critique the current status of knowledge in this area. The conventional qualitative content analysis method was employed for data analysis. The results highlighted the incompatibility of three basic educational elements i.e. engineering curriculum, educational resources and engineering students learning characteristics all of which posed major challenges in teaching and learning engineering courses. Multimedia instruction enhances engineering students understanding of engineering concepts, procedures, problems and solutions through direct visualization. Furthermore, it could indirectly assist students in achieving higher order learning levels and skills through enhancing or supporting educational resources and increasing students motivation. Mobile multimedia instruction and a student-generated multimedia learning approach to improve engineering education are suggested for future research.","authors":["Ataollah Zarei","Khairiyah
