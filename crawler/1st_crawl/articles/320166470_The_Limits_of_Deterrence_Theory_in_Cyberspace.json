{"id":"320166470_The_Limits_of_Deterrence_Theory_in_Cyberspace","abstract":"In this article, I analyse deterrence theory and argue that its applicability to cyberspace is limited and that these limits are not trivial. They are the consequence of fundamental differences between deterrence theory and the nature of cyber conflicts and cyberspace. The goals of this analysis are to identify the limits of deterrence theory in cyberspace, clear the ground of inadequate approaches to cyber deterrence, and define the conceptual space for a domain-specific theory of cyber deterrence, still to be developed.","authors":["Mariarosaria Taddeo"],"meta":["September 2018Philosophy & Technology 31(2)","DOI:10.1007/s13347-017-0290-2"],"references":["319553661_Deterrence_by_Norms_to_Stop_Interstate_Cyber_Attacks","315705213_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_'Good_Society'_the_US_EU_and_UK_approach","313022567_Five_Kinds_of_Cyber_Deterrence","310466388_Deterrence_theory_in_the_cyber-century_Lessons_from_a_state-of-the-art_literature_review","327541267_The_essential_features_of_an_ontology_for_cyberwarfare","322036826_An_environmental_approach_to_understanding_cyberpower","322036656_Deterrence_of_cyber_attacks","317065626_Cyber_Conflicts_and_Political_Power_in_Information_Societies","313129837_The_Strategy_of_Conflict","310742382_On_the_Risks_of_Relying_on_Analogies_to_Understand_Cyber_Conflicts"]}
