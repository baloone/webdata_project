{"id":"294792040_New_Perspectives_on_the_Demography_of_the_Roman_Province_Moesia_Inferior","abstract":"After a brief presentation of the demographic data coming from ancient Rome and of the demography of Moesia Inferior, the authors propose new perspectives on the demographic dimension of the province under discussion. They demonstrate that aspects such as life expectancy, age structure, mortality, fertility and migration have been studied only during the last years, and that research in that respect is only at its beginnings. Through a project (CNCSIS IDEI nr. 103/2008: Migration and acculturation in the East European part of the Roman world - 1st-7th c. CE), in which the two authors have been involved, the research of migration will be directed along new lines: by pointing out new aspects of migration, as reflected linguistically; by turning to account, in a complex fashion, the archeological and epigraphic sources that regard migration and acculturation; also, by providing concrete views on the degree of Romanization of Moesia Inferior, a subject that has been treated in a rather sequential manner in the world historiography.","authors":["Lucretiu Birliba","Roxana-Gabriela CurcÄƒ"],"meta":["December 2010The Mankind Quarterly 51(2):139-153","DOI:10.46469/mq.2010.51.2.2"],"references":["7335543_Roman_Life_Expectancy_Ulpian's_Evidence","313384341_The_Cambridge_Economic_History_of_the_Greco-Roman_World","274887770_Roman_Life_Expectancy_The_Pannonian_Evidence","270437249_L'age_au_deces_d'apres_les_inscriptions_funeraires","259415140_Human_Mobility_in_Roman_Italy_I_The_Free_Population","51800694_On_the_Probable_Age_Structure_of_the_Roman_Population"]}
