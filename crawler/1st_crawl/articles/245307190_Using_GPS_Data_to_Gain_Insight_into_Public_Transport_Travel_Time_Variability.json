{"id":"245307190_Using_GPS_Data_to_Gain_Insight_into_Public_Transport_Travel_Time_Variability","abstract":"Transit service reliability is an important determinant of service quality, which has been mainly studied from the perspective of passengers waiting at stops. Day-to-day variability of travel time also deteriorates service reliability, but is not a well-researched area in the literature partly due to the lack of comprehensive data sets on bus travel times. While this problem is now being addressed through the uptake of global positioning system (GPS)-based tracking systems, methodologies to analyze these data sets are limited. This paper addresses this issue by investigating day-to-day variability in public transport travel time using a GPS data set for a bus route in Melbourne, Australia. It explores the nature and shape of travel time distributions for different departure time windows at different times of the day. Factors causing travel time variability of public transport are also explored using a linear regression analysis. The results show that in narrower departure time windows, travel time distributions are best characterized by normal distributions. For wider departure time windows, peak-hour travel times follow normal distributions, while off-peak travel times follow lognormal distributions. The factors contributing to the variability of travel times are found to be land use, route length, number of traffic signals, number of bus stops, and departure delay relative to the scheduled departure time. Travel time variability is higher in the AM peak and lower in the off-peak. The impact of rainfall on travel time variability is only found significant in the AM peak. While the paper presents new methods for analyzing GPS-based data, there is much scope for expanding knowledge through wider applications to new data sets and using a wider range of explanatory variables.","authors":["Ehsan Mazloumi","Graham Currie","Geoffrey Rose"],"meta":["January 2009Journal of Transportation Engineering 136(7)","DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000126"],"references":["279768538_Service_Reliability_Impacts_of_Computer-Aided_Dispatching_and_Automatic_Vehicle_Location_Technology_A_Tri-Met_Case_Study","252044527_Prediction_Model_of_Bus_Arrival_and_Departure_Times_Using_AVL_and_APC_Data","249960963_Running_time_model_for_bus_operations_in_Singapore","230663790_Travel_time_variability_A_review_of_theoretical_and_empirical_issues","4180774_The_impact_of_adverse_weather_conditions_on_urban_bus_performance_measures","348862347_Basic_Statistics_for_Social_Research_Step-by-Step_Calculations_Computer_Techniques_Using_Minitab","303014948_Trip_time_characteristics_of_journeys_to_and_from_work","292425113_METHODS_FOR_MAINTAINING_TRANSIT_SERVICE_REGULARITY","279894853_Analyzing_transit_travel_time_performance_Transp_Res_Rec","279670705_Factors_Affecting_Reliability_of_Urban_Bus_Services","268596456_A_Real-Time_Bus_Travel-Time_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Kalman_Filtering_Theory","245562766_Investigating_Consistency_in_Transit_Passenger_Arrivals_Insights_from_Longitudinal_Automated_Fare_Collection_Data","245561300_Part_4_Capacity_and_Quality_of_Service_Service_Reliability_and_Hidden_Waiting_Time_Insights_from_Automatic_Vehicle_Location_Data","245560706_Vehicle_Reidentification_as_Method_for_Deriving_Travel_Time_and_Travel_Time_Distributions_Investigation","245559847_Measuring_Variability_in_Traffic_Conditions_by_Using_Archived_Traffic_Data","245306462_Dynamic_Bus_Arrival_Time_Prediction_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks","245306083_Variability_of_Individual_Travel_Time_Components","245306082_Operational_Feasibility_of_Timed_Transfer_in_Transit_Systems","242933035_Travel_Time_Variability--The_Case_of_Two_Public_Modes","242933022_Zone_Scheduling_of_Bus_Routes_to_Improve_Service_Reliability","242932797_Dispatching_Policies_for_a_Transportation_Route","239439049_Using_Automatic_Vehicle_Identification_Data_to_Gain_Insight_into_Travel_Time_Variability_and_Its_Causes","239438109_Models_for_Predicting_Bus_Delays","237741825_Time_Point-Level_Analysis_of_Passenger_Demand_and_Transit_Service_Reliability","229468318_Dense_network_traffic_models_Travel_time_reliability_and_traffic_management_I_General_introduction","227074518_A_study_of_travel_time_and_reliability_on_arterial_routes","226455248_Determination_of_the_number_and_locations_of_time_points_in_transit_schedule_design_-_Case_of_a_single_run","223046592_Factors_affecting_running_time_on_transit_routes_Transp_Res_Part_A_Policy_Pract","222329485_The_Value_of_Time_and_Reliability_Measurement_from_a_Value_Pricing_Experiment","222164333_The_valuation_of_reliability_for_personal_travel","27348526_Travel_time_prediction_for_urban_networks","23526095_Empirical_Analysis_of_Bus_Transit_On-time_Performance"]}
