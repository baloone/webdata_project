{"id":"352337539_VIDEO_ANALYSIS_AND_3D_DETECTION_SIMULATION_OF_JUMP_SHOT_PRECISION_FOR_BASKETBALL_PLAYERS","abstract":"With the rapid development and application of computer technology, the application of computer science knowledge in basketball is also more and more extensive. Based on genetic algorithm and the background subtraction method, video analysis and 3D detection simulation model of shot jump action precision were constructed in this study. According to the genetic algorithm search method, jump shot precision was analyzed, and the problems encountered in the actual shooting process of basketball players were studied and solved. The results show that this study is necessary and feasible.","authors":["Yi Zheng"],"meta":["June 2021Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte 27(spe2):104-107","DOI:10.1590/1517-8692202127022021_0020"],"references":["277818095_Detection_of_Alzheimer's_disease_and_mild_cognitive_impairment_based_on_structural_volumetric_MR_images_using_3D-DWT_and_WTA-KSVM_trained_by_PSOTVAC","277408507_An_action-incongruent_secondary_task_modulates_prediction_accuracy_in_experienced_performers_evidence_for_motor_simulation","276361372_Physiological_and_movement_demands_of_Rugby_League_referees"]}
