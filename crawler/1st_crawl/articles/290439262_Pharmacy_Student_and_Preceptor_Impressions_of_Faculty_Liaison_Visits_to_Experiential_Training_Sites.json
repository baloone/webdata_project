{"id":"290439262_Pharmacy_Student_and_Preceptor_Impressions_of_Faculty_Liaison_Visits_to_Experiential_Training_Sites","abstract":"Objective: \nTo characterize preceptor and student views about and experiences with faculty liaison visits to practice sites during clinical internships.\n\nMethods: \nA survey was administered at the conclusion of each of the first 3 academic years of a new postbaccalaureate doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program.\n\nResults: \nPreceptors were satisfied overall with faculty liaison visits, while students initially were not; however, their perception increased in subsequent years. Students felt development of their patient care skills benefited, but less so their interpersonal communication skills. Each year, almost all preceptors indicated faculty liaison visits were helpful in developing and refining their mentorship skills.\n\nConclusion: \nFaculty liaison visits provided a valuable opportunity to interact and support preceptors and students during advanced pharmacy internships in a nascent PharmD program.","authors":["Kerry Wilbur","Maria A Paiva","Emily Black"],"meta":["November 2015American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 79(9):Article 134","DOI:10.5688/ajpe799134"],"references":["307711196_A_global_perspective_on_postgraduate_medical_education","233057564_Transnational_Higher_Education_Offshore_Campuses_in_the_Middle_East","224868579_A_Collaborative_Approach_to_Improving_and_Expanding_an_Experiential_Education_Program","224868574_Pharmacy_Preceptors'_Views_on_the_Value_and_Optimal_Frequency_of_Quality_Assurance_Visits_to_Advanced_Pharmacy_Practice_Experience_Sites","41893563_Undergraduate_medical_education_in_the_Gulf_Cooperation_Council_A_multi-countries_study_Part_1","24238544_Pharmacy_Education_and_Practice_in_13_Middle_Eastern_Countries","307754998_A_Clinical_Encounter_of_East_Meets_West","285635650_Global_Development_of_Pharmacy_Education","247521986_Pharmacists'_views_of_preceptorship","223989870_Importance_of_Direct_Patient_Care_in_Advanced_Pharmacy_Practice_Experiences"]}
