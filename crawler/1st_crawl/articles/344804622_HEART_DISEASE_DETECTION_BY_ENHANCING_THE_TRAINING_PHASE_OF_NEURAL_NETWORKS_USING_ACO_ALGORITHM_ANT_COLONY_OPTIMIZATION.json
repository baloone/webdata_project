In order to improve the global solution to this problem by\napproaching a novel system like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. In this method, we are using Cleveland database\nget from the UCI Machine learning repository. This UCI repository having 75 attributes, but a subset of 14 of them, 13 are taken\nas input attributes and 1 attribute as an predicted output value.\nKeywords: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), UCI Machine Learning Repository, Cleveland database","authors":["Pagalla Bhavani Shankar"],"meta":["October 2020"],"references":["302595835_Research_on_an_Improved_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_and_its_Application"]}
