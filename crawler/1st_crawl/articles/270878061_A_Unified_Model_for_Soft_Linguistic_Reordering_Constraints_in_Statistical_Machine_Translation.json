{"id":"270878061_A_Unified_Model_for_Soft_Linguistic_Reordering_Constraints_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation","abstract":"This paper explores a simple and effective unified framework for incorporating soft linguistic reordering constraints into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system: 1) a syntactic reordering model that explores reorderings for context free grammar rules; and 2) a semantic reordering model that focuses on the reordering of predicate-argument structures. We develop novel features based on both models and use them as soft constraints to guide the translation process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based translation system. However, the gain achieved by the semantic reordering model is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering model, and we therefore provide a detailed analysis of the behavior differences between the two.","authors":["Junhui Li","Yuval Marton","Ps Resnik","Hal Daum√© III"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.3115/v1/P14-1106","Conference: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"],"references":["266030634_A_Phrase_Orientation_Model_for_Hierarchical_Machine_Translation","262254700_Modeling_the_translation_of_predicate-argument_structure_for_SMT","244431788_Improving_a_statistical_MT_system_with_automatically_learned_rewrite_patterns","228355560_A_conditional_random_field_word_segmenter_for_sighan_bakeoff_2005","221102001_Syntax_Based_Reordering_with_Automatically_Derived_Rules_for_Improved_Statistical_Machine_Translation","221101590_Constituent_Reordering_and_Syntax_Models_for_English-to-Japanese_Statistical_Machine_Translation","221013122_Chinese_Syntactic_Reordering_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","221013020_Statistical_Significance_Tests_for_Machine_Translation_Evaluation","220874793_Clause_Restructuring_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","220874186_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Training_for_L1-regularized_Log-linear_Models_with_Cumulative_Penalty","220874141_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Syntax-based_Reordering_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","220873976_Joint_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Parsing_of_Chinese","220873497_Improved_Statistical_Alignment_Models","220816955_Using_a_Dependency_Parser_to_Improve_SMT_for_Subject-Object-Verb_Languages","220816913_Statistical_Phrase-Based_Translation","2588204_BLEU_a_Method_for_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Machine_Translation","313604452_Semantic_roles_for_SMT_A_hybrid_two-pass_model","307174896_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","290548257_Modeling_syntactic_and_semantic_structures_in_hierarchical_phrase-based_translation","289690359_Factored_soft_source_syntactic_constraints_for_hierarchical_machine_translation","286962983_Source-side_classifier_preordering_for_machine_translation","270878774_Integrating_Phrase-based_Reordering_Features_into_a_Chart-based_Decoder_for_Machine_Translation","270878704_Mr_MIRA_Open-Source_Large-Margin_Structured_Learning_on_MapReduce","270877997_Handling_Ambiguities_of_Bilingual_Predicate-Argument_Structures_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","270877389_Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts","268361875_Extracting_Pre-ordering_Rules_from_Predicate-Argument_Structures","266030621_Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","262251959_A_ranking-based_approach_to_word_reordering_for_statistical_machine_translation","254762373_Context-Sensitive_Syntactic_Source-Reordering_by_Statistical_Transduction","221101570_Semantic_Role_Features_for_Machine_Translation","221101411_Automatically_Learning_Source-side_Reordering_Rules_for_Large_Scale_Machine_Translation","221012709_Online_Large-Margin_Training_of_Syntactic_and_Structural_Translation_Features","221012597_Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation","220875255_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","220874532_Soft_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Hierarchical_Phrased-Based_Translation","220873904_Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax","220873565_Topological_Ordering_of_Function_Words_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-based_Translation","220873470_Learning_Hierarchical_Translation_Structure_with_Linguistic_Annotations","220873209_cdec_A_Decoder_Alignment_and_Learning_Framework_for_Finite-State_and_Context-Free_Translation_Models","220817390_A_Direct_Syntax-Driven_Reordering_Model_for_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation","220817107_Improved_Inference_for_Unlexicalized_Parsing","220816893_Semantic_roles_for_SMT_a_hybrid_two-pass_model","220597322_The_Penn_Chinese_TreeBank_Phrase_structure_annotation_of_a_large_corpus","220597293_Adding_semantic_roles_to_the_Chinese_Treebank","220355362_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation","220017689_The_Proposition_Bank_An_Annotated_Corpus_of_Semantic_Roles"]}
