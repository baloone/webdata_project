Seeking an optimal generic model for optimizing is a computer science study that has been being practically conducted by numerous researchers. Generic model is a model that can be technically operated to solve any varieties of optimization problem. By using an object-oriented method, the generic model for optimizing was constructed. Moreover, two types of optimization method, simulated-annealing and hill-climbing, were functioned in constructing the model and compared to find the most optimal one then. The result said that both methods gave the same result for a value of objective function and the hill-climbing based model consumed the shortest running time.","authors":["Ditdit Nugeraha Utama","Ani N.","Maulana Muhammad Iqbal"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 978(1):012045","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/978/1/012045","Project: DSS and Corporate IS"],"references":["343648607_The_Optimization_of_the_3-d_Structure_of_Plants_Using_Functional-Structural_Plant_Models_Case_Study_of_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_in_Indonesia","323786251_Decision_Support_Model_for_Mosque_Renovation_and_Rehabilitation_Case_Study_Ten_Mosques_in_Jakarta_Barat_Indonesia","308366072_Generic_Pareto_local_search_metaheuristic_for_optimization_of_targeted_offers_in_a_bi-objective_direct_marketing_campaign","303940922_The_Use_of_Fuzzy_Alpha_Cut_to_Improve_the_Forecasting_Range_Results_of_the_ARIMA_Model_Assist_Decision_Making_Process","303868555_A_Generic_Methodology_for_Superstructure_Optimization_of_Different_Processing_Networks","311582026_New_optimization_model_for_routing_and_spectrum_assignment_with_nodes_insecurity","311362189_Development_of_signal_optimization_models_for_asymmetric_two-leg_continuous_flow_intersections","309725623_A_multi-objective_optimization_model_to_enhance_the_comprehensive_performance_of_underground_gas_drainage_system","309176110_A_Water_Flow_Algorithm_based_Optimization_Model_for_Road_Traffic_Engineering","302972516_Optimization_models_for_placement_of_an_energy-aware_electric_vehicle_charging_infrastructure"]}
