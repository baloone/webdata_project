{"id":"271387962_A_Reconfigurations_Analogue_of_Brooks'_Theorem_and_Its_Consequences","abstract":"Let $G$ be a simple undirected graph on $n$ vertices with maximum\ndegree~$\\Delta$. Brooks' Theorem states that $G$ has a $\\Delta$-colouring\nunless~$G$ is a complete graph, or a cycle with an odd number of vertices. To\nrecolour $G$ is to obtain a new proper colouring by changing the colour of one\nvertex. We show an analogue of Brooks' Theorem by proving that from any\n$k$-colouring, $k>\\Delta$, a $\\Delta$-colouring of $G$ can be obtained by a\nsequence of $O(n^2)$ recolourings using only the original $k$ colours unless\n$G$ is a complete graph or a cycle with an odd number of vertices, or\n$k=\\Delta+1$, $G$ is $\\Delta$-regular and, for each vertex $v$ in $G$, no two\nneighbours of $v$ are coloured alike.\nWe use this result to study the reconfiguration graph $R_k(G)$ of the\n$k$-colourings of $G$. The vertex set of $R_k(G)$ is the set of all possible\n$k$-colourings of $G$ and two colourings are adjacent if they differ on exactly\none vertex. We prove that for $\\Delta\\geq 3$, $R_{\\Delta+1}(G)$ consists of\nisolated vertices and at most one further component which has diameter\n$O(n^2)$. This result enables us to complete both a structural classification\nand an algorithmic classification for reconfigurations of colourings of graphs\nof bounded maximum degree.","authors":["Carl Feghali","Matthew Johnson","DaniÃ«l Paulusma"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Graph Theory 83(4)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.22000","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","261101064_Colouring_Reconfiguration_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","260295061_Vertex_Cover_Reconfiguration_and_Beyond","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220194396_Connectedness_of_the_graph_of_vertex-colourings","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","291009147_A_Reconfigurations_Analogue_of_Brooks'_Theorem","268820225_Fast_Recoloring_of_Sparse_Graphs","267373223_Mixing_Graph_Colourings","261726425_Reconfiguration_of_List_L21-Labelings_in_a_Graph","261289085_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring","261100604_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_No-Constants_and_Quantified_Variants","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","260107740_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs","259441440_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Dichotomies_for_Formulas_and_Circuits","257428407_On_the_Grundy_and_b-Chromatic_Numbers_of_a_Graph","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","250765908_New_proof_of_brooks'_theorem","235601904_Recoloring_bounded_treewidth_graphs","226472035_Reconfiguration_of_List_Edge-Colorings_in_a_Graph","226258132_On_Colouring_the_Nodes_of_a_Network","225519934_Mixing_3-Colourings_in_Bipartite_Graphs","225370913_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","224836520_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","222057470_Some_Simplified_NP-Complete_Graph_Problems","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220944627_On_the_Boolean_Connectivity_Problem_for_Horn_Relations","220908429_An_Improved_Sufficient_Condition_Tor_Reconfiguration_of_List_Edge-Colorings_in_a_Tree","220908415_Approximability_of_the_Subset_Sum_Reconfiguration_Problem","220568088_On_the_Boolean_Connectivity_Problem_for_Horn_Relations","220345186_Randomly_coloring_sparse_random_graphs_with_fewer_colors_than_the_maximum_degree","220194209_Minimal_reducible_bounds_for_the_class_of_-degenerate_graphs","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148982_Finding_Paths_between_graph_colourings_PSPACE-completeness_and_superpolynomial_distances","220148404_Shortest_paths_between_shortest_paths","46585526_The_Complexity_of_Rerouting_Shortest_Paths","40883947_Vertex_partitions_and_maximum_degenerate_subgraphs","30526552_Mixing_3-colourings_in_bipartite_graphs_extended_abstract","2935513_Acyclic_Star_and_Oriented_Colourings_of_Graph_Subdivisions"]}
