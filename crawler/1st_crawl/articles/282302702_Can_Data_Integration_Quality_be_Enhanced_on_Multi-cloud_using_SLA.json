{"id":"282302702_Can_Data_Integration_Quality_be_Enhanced_on_Multi-cloud_using_SLA","abstract":"This paper identifies trends and open issues regarding the use of SLA in data integration solutions on multi-cloud environments. Therefore it presents results of a Systematic Mapping [3] that analyzes the way SLA, data integration and multi-cloud environments are correlated in existing works. The main result is a classification scheme consisting of facets and dimensions namely (i) data integration environment (cloud; data warehouse; federated database; multi-cloud); (ii) data integration description (knowledge; metadata; schema); and (iii) data quality (confidentiality; privacy; security; SLA; data protection; data provenance). The proposed classification scheme is used to organize a collection of representative papers and discuss the numerical analysis about research trends in the domain.","authors":["Nadia Bennani","Genoveva vargas solar","Chirine Ghedira","Pl√°cido Antonio de Souza Neto"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22852-5_13","Conference: International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications","Project: Data Integration in Multi-Cloud Environment"],"references":["228350426_Systematic_Mapping_Studies_in_Software_Engineering","336573400_Systematic_Mapping_Studies_in_Software_Engineering","289513018_Linked_USDL_A_Vocabulary_for_Web-Scale_Service_Trading","271967311_NoSQL_Distilled_A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Emerging_World_of_Polyglot_Persistence","271468762_Self-establishing_a_Service_Level_Agreement_within_Autonomic_Cloud_Networking_Environment","224361619_A_Privacy_Preserving_Repository_for_Data_Integration_across_Data_Sharing_Services"]}
