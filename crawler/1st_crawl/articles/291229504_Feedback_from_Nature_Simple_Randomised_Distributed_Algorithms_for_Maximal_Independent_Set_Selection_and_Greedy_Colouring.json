{"id":"291229504_Feedback_from_Nature_Simple_Randomised_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Maximal_Independent_Set_Selection_and_Greedy_Colouring","abstract":"We propose distributed algorithms for two well-established problems that\noperate efficiently under extremely harsh conditions. Our algorithms achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in a simple and novel way.\nOur algorithm for maximal independent set selection operates on a network of\nidentical anonymous processors. The processor at each node has no prior\ninformation about the network. At each time step, each node can only broadcast\na single bit to all its neighbours, or remain silent. Each node can detect\nwhether one or more neighbours have broadcast, but cannot tell how many of its\nneighbours have broadcast, or which ones. We build on recent work of Afek et\nal. which was inspired by studying the development of a network of cells in the\nfruit fly~\\cite{Afek2011a}. However we incorporate for the first time another\nimportant feature of the biological system: varying the probability value used\nat each node based on local feedback from neighbouring nodes. Given any\n$n$-node network, our algorithm achieves the optimal expected time complexity\nof $O(\\log n)$ rounds and the optimal expected message complexity of $O(1)$\nsingle-bit messages broadcast by each node.We also show that the previous\napproach, without feedback, cannot achieve better than $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$\nexpected time complexity, whatever global scheme is used to choose the\nprobabilities.\nOur algorithm for distributed greedy colouring works under similar harsh\nconditions: each identical node has no prior information about the network, can\nonly broadcast a single message to all neighbours at each time step\nrepresenting a desired colour, and can only detect whether at least one\nneighbour has broadcast each colour value. We show that our algorithm has an\nexpected time complexity of $O(\\Delta+\\log n)$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum\ndegree of the network, and expected message complexity of $O(1)$ messages\nbroadcast by each node.","authors":["Peter Jeavons","Alex Scott","Lei Xu"],"meta":["October 2016Distributed Computing 29(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00446-016-0269-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304608977_The_Locality_of_Distributed_Symmetry_Breaking","258652790_A_Distributed_Approach_for_Frequency_allocation_using_Graph_Coloring_in_Mobile_Networks","336940257_Fast_Deterministic_Distributed_Maximal_Independent_Set_Computation_on_Growth-Bounded_Graphs","311463725_Coloring_spatial_point_processes_with_applications_to_peer_discovery_in_large_wireless_networks","285198043_Mathematics_and_games","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","277296348_Distributed_Algorithms","274864812_Distributed_Delta1-Coloring_in_Linear_in_Delta_Time","271002938_Patterns_from_nature_Distributed_greedy_colouring_with_simple_messages_and_minimal_graph_knowledge","258328206_Distributed_Delta_1-coloring_in_linear_in_Delta_time","245954051_Distributed_Algorithms_Chapter_6_7","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","242791786_Simple_Distributed_1Coloring_of_Graphs","242405712_Application_of_the_graph_coloring_algorithm_to_the_frequency_assignment_problem","239593861_Distributed_Computing_A_Locality-Sensitive_Approach"]}
