{"id":"222431820_Exponential_smoothing_The_state_of_the_art-Part_II","abstract":"In Gardner [Gardner, E. S., Jr. (1985). Exponential smoothing: The state of the art. Journal of Forecasting 4, 1–28], I reviewed the research in exponential smoothing since the original work by Brown and Holt. This paper brings the state of the art up to date. The most important theoretical advance is the invention of a complete statistical rationale for exponential smoothing based on a new class of state-space models with a single source of error. The most important practical advance is the development of a robust method for smoothing damped multiplicative trends. We also have a new adaptive method for simple smoothing, the first such method to demonstrate credible improved forecast accuracy over fixed-parameter smoothing. Longstanding confusion in the literature about whether and how to renormalize seasonal indices in the Holt–Winters methods has finally been resolved. There has been significant work in forecasting for inventory control, including the development of new predictive distributions for total lead-time demand and several improved versions of Croston's method for forecasting intermittent time series. Regrettably, there has been little progress in the identification and selection of exponential smoothing methods. The research in this area is best described as inconclusive, and it is still difficult to beat the application of a damped trend to every time series.","authors":["Everette Gardner"],"meta":["October 2006International Journal of Forecasting 22(4):637-666","DOI:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.03.005","SourceRePEc"],"references":["333413808_Learning_from_forecasting_competitions","331518644_Forecasting_seasonals_and_trends_by_exponentially_weighted_moving_averages","284529344_Robustness_of_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimates_for_Multi-Step_Predictions_The_Exponential_Smoothing_Case","284296798_It's_time_to_move_from_'what'_to_'why'","279343641_Encyclopedia_of_Operations_Research_and_Management_Science","275902595_Lead_Time_Demand_Adjustments_or_When_is_a_Model_Not_a_Model","274793612_A_Reply_to_Johnston","273134799_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model","272595821_A_Note_on_Exponentially_Smoothed_Seasonal_Differences","271686570_Predictors_Projecting_Linear_Trends_Plus_Seasonal_Dummies","268702960_Exponential_Smoothing_for_Multivariate_Time_Series","267661405_The_analysis_of_time_series_An_introduction_2nd_ed","266197012_Smoothing_forecasting_and_prediction_of_discrete_time_series_2nd_printing","263328704_Simpler_Exponentially_Weighted_Moving_Averages_with_Irregular_Updating_Periods","263327879_Adaptive_Holt-Winters_Forecasting","261809375_A_Comment_on_Forecasting_and_Stock_Control_for_Intermittent_Demands","261611685_The_Analysis_of_Time_Series_An_Introduction_4th_ed","256507033_Error_analysis_for_Winters'_Additive_Seasonal_Forecasting_system","254284335_Specification_Analysis","248094506_Time_Series_and_System_Analysis_With_Applications","248057996_The_Variance_of_Lead-Time_Demand","247459534_Seasonal_heteroscedasticity_and_trends","247364980_Recursive_Estimation_of_Dynamic_Linear_Models","247229722_Predictive_Dialing_for_Outbound_Telephone_Call_Centers","247123436_Simple_vs_complex_extrapolation_modelsAn_evaluation_in_the_food_processing_industry","246922640_Model_uncertainty_and_Forecast_Accuracy","246382642_Holt-Winters_Forecasting_Some_Practical_Issues","246213051_Forecasting_and_Stock_Control_for_Intermittent_Demands","246148518_Exponential_Forecasting_some_new_variations","245748952_Computer_Forecasting_of_Australian_Rules_Football_for_a_Daily_Newspaper","245701578_Comments_on''Exponential_smoothing_the_state_of_the_art''by","245281076_Forecasting_for_the_ordering_and_stock-holding_of_spare_parts","245281022_Forecasting_Demand_Variation_When_There_Are_Stockouts","245280981_Potential_inventory_cost_reductions_using_advanced_time_series_forecasting_techniques","245280703_Selecting_the_best_periodic_inventory_control_and_demand_forecasting_methods_for_low_demand_items","245280565_An_Emergency_Vehicle_Dispatching_System_for_an_Electric_Utility_in_Chile","245280474_Simpler_Exponentially_Weighted_Moving_Averages_with_Irregular_Updating_Periods_Response","245280464_Exponentially_Weighted_Moved_Average_EWMA_with_Irregular_Updating_Periods","245280290_Modelling_IntraCity_Time-Dependent_Travel_Speeds_for_Vehicle_Scheduling_Problems","245279996_Progressive_Tuning_of_Simple_Exponential_Smoothing_Forecasts","245279572_Control_Theory_in_ProductionInventory_Systems_A_Case_Study_in_a_Food_Processing_Organization","245278621_A_New_Procedure_for_the_Distribution_of_Periodicals","245278128_Decision_Rules_for_Inventory_Management","243765134_Exponential_Smoothing_The_State_of_the_Art","243764307_Prediction_by_Exponentially_Weighted_Moving_Averages_and_Related_Methods","243737876_Optimal_Properties_of_Exponentially_Weighted_Forecasts","242931652_Exponential_Smoothing_as_a_Special_Case_of_a_Linear_Stochastic_System","242931378_Response-Variance_Tradeoffs_in_Adaptive_Forecasting","242930743_A_Note_on_Exponential_Smoothing_and_Autocorrelated_Inputs","241286256_An_Approach_for_Selecting_Times_Series_Forecasting_Models","240259970_Applying_Contemporary_Forecasting_and_Computer_Technologyfor_Competitive_Advantage_in_Service_Operations","239998058_Forecasting_and_Prediction_of_Discrete_Time_Series","239386248_Cohort_Analysis_Technique_for_Long-Term_Manpower_Planning_the_Case_of_a_Hong_Kong_Tertiary_Institution","239386040_Adaptive_Sales_Forecasting_with_Many_Stockouts","239059661_Robustness_of_MLE_for_multi-step_predictions_the_exponential_smoothing_case"]}
