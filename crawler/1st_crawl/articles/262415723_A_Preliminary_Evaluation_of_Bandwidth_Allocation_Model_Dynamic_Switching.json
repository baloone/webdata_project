{"id":"262415723_A_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_Bandwidth_Allocation_Model_Dynamic_Switching","abstract":"Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) are used in order to define Bandwidth Constraints (BCs) in a per-class basis for MPLS/DS-TE networks and effectively define how network resources like bandwidth are obtained and shared by applications. The BAMs proposed (MAM – Maximum Allocation Model, RDM – Russian Dolls Model, G-RDM – Generic RDM and AllocTC-Sharing) attempt to optimize the use of bandwidth resources on a per-link basis with different allocation and resource sharing characteristics. As such, the adoption of distinct BAMs and/or changes in network resource demands (network traffic profile) may result in different network traffic allocation and operational behavior for distinct BAMs. This paper evaluates the resulting network characteristics (li\nnk utilization, preemption and flows blocking) of using BAMs dynamically with different traffic scenarios. In brief, it is investigated the dynamics of BAM switching with distinct traffic scenarios. The paper presents initially the investigated BAMs in relation to their behavior and resource allocation characteristics. Then, distinct BAMs are compared using different traffic scenarios in order to investigate the impact of a dynamic change of the BAM configured in the network. Finally, the paper shows that the adoption of a dynamic BAM allocation strategy may result in benefits for network operation in terms of link utilization, preemption and flows blocking.","authors":["Joberto S B Martins","Romildo Martins da Silva Bezerra","Rafael Freitas Reale"],"meta":["May 2014International Journal of Computer Networks and Communications Security 6(3):27","DOI:10.5121/ijcnc.2014.6311","Project: RePAF- A Dynamic and Autonomic Resource Allocation Framework for MPLS, Elastic Optical Networks (EON), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and IoT"],"references":["261451978_Routing_in_DS-TE_Networks_with_an_Opportunistic_Bandwidth_Allocation_Model","236858280_A_RDM-like_Bandwidth_Management_Algorithm_for_Traffic_Engineering_with_DiffServ_and_MPLS_Support","236858239_Routing_in_DS-TE_Networks_with_an_Opportunistic_Bandwidth_Allocation_Model","224567670_An_autonomic_architecture_to_manage_Ubiquitous_Computing_networks_and_applications","247437757_Russian_Dolls_Bandwidth_Constraints_Model_for_Diff-Serv-aware_MPLS_Traffic_Engineering","247289681_Protocol_extensions_for_support_of_Diff-Serv-aware_MPLS_Traffic_Engineering","242481356_Maximum_Allocation_Bandwidth_Constraints_Model_for_Diffserv-aware_MPLS_Traffic_Engineering","239065109_Simulating_Computer_Systems_Techniques_and_Tools","224580156_Towards_Autonomic_Network_Management_an_Analysis_of_Current_and_Future_Research_Directions","224298288_G-RDM_a_new_bandwidth_constraints_model_for_DS-TE_networks"]}
