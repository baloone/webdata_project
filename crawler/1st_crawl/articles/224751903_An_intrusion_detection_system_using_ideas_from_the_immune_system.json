{"id":"224751903_An_intrusion_detection_system_using_ideas_from_the_immune_system","abstract":"This paper proposes an intrusion detection framework and presents a prototype for an intrusion detection system based on it. This framework takes architectural inspiration from the human immune system and brings desirable features to intrusion detection systems, such as automated intrusion recovery, attack signature extraction, and potential to improve behavior-based detection. These features are enabled through intrusion evidence detection. The prototype, called ADENOIDS, is designed to deal with application attacks, extracting signature for remote buffer overflow attacks. The framework and ADENOIDS are described and experimental results are presented.","authors":["Fabrício de Paula","Leandro De Castro","Paulo Lício De Geus"],"meta":["July 2004","DOI:10.1109/CEC.2004.1330979","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Evolutionary Computation, 2004.
