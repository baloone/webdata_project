{"id":"314080111_Hidden_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks","abstract":"This paper introduces the new graph-theoretical concept of hidden community structure in complex networks. Complex networks may contain both stronger, dominant communities as well as weak, hidden communities. We consider a weak community to be hidden if most of its members also belong to stronger communities. We propose a meta-approach named HICODE (HIdden COmmunity DEtection) for identifying the hidden community structure as well as enhancing the detection of the dominant community structure. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world networks, and demonstrate that HICODE outperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in terms of uncovering both the dominant and the hidden structure. Due to the difficulty of labeling all ground truth communities in real-world datasets, HICODE provides a promising technique to pinpoint the existing latent communities and uncover communities for which there is no ground truth.","authors":["Kun He","Yingru Li","Sucheta Soundarajan","John E.
