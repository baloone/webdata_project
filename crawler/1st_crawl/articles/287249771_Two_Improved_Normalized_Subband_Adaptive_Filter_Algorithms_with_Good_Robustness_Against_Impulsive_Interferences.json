{"id":"287249771_Two_Improved_Normalized_Subband_Adaptive_Filter_Algorithms_with_Good_Robustness_Against_Impulsive_Interferences","abstract":"To improve the robustness of subband adaptive filter (SAF) against impulsive\ninterferences, we propose two modified SAF algorithms with an individual scale\nfunction for each subband, which are derived by maximizing correntropy-based\ncost function and minimizing logarithm-based cost function, respectively,\ncalled MCC-SAF and LC-SAF. Whenever the impulsive interference happens, the\nsubband scale functions can sharply drop the step size, which eliminate the\ninfluence of outliers on the tap-weight vector update. Therefore, the proposed\nalgorithms are robust against impulsive interferences, and exhibit the faster\nconvergence rate and better tracking capability than the sign SAF (SSAF)\nalgorithm. Besides, in impulse-free interference environments, the proposed\nalgorithms achieve similar convergence performance as the normalized SAF (NSAF)\nalgorithm. Simulation results have demonstrated the performance of our proposed\nalgorithms.","authors":["Yi Yu","Haiquan Zhao","BD Chen","Zhengyou He"],"meta":["December 2016Circuits Systems and Signal Processing 35(12)","DOI:10.1007/s00034-016-0289-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["285374981_Subband_Decomposition_and_Multirate_Systems","285045566_Novel_sign_subband_adaptive_filter_algorithms_with_individual_weighting_factors","283743900_Steady-state_mean-square-deviation_analysis_of_the_sign_subband_adaptive_filter_algorithm","283232039_A_robust_band-dependent_variable_step_size_NSAF_algorithm_against_impulsive_noises","282495698_A_New_Normalized_Subband_Adaptive_Filter_Algorithm_with_Individual_Variable_Step_Sizes","274750713_Sparseness-Controlled_Proportionate_Affine_Projection_Sign_Algorithms_for_Acoustic_Echo_Cancellation","262169779_Fast_communication_Two_variants_of_the_sign_subband_adaptive_filter_with_improved_convergence_rate","262025692_Steady-State_Mean-Square_Error_Analysis_for_Adaptive_Filtering_under_the_Maximum_Correntropy_Criterion","260666978_A_Normalized_Least_Mean_Squares_Algorithm_With_a_Step-Size_Scaler_Against_Impulsive_Measurement_Noise","260615318_Normalised_subband_adaptive_filter_with_variable_step_size"]}
