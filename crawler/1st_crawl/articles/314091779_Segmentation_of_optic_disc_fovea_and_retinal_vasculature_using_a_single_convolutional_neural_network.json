{"id":"314091779_Segmentation_of_optic_disc_fovea_and_retinal_vasculature_using_a_single_convolutional_neural_network","abstract":"We have developed and trained a convolutional neural network to automatically and simultaneously segment optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. Fundus images were normalized before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast. For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the pointâ€™s neighbourhood and forwarded the response across the 7-layer network. The output layer consists of four neurons, representing background, optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. In average, our segmentation correctly classified 92.68% of the ground truths (on the testing set from Drive database). The highest accuracy achieved on a single image was 94.54%, the lowest 88.85%. A single convolutional neural network can be used not just to segment blood vessels, but also optic disc and fovea with good accuracy.","authors":["Jen Hong Tan","U Rajendra Acharya","Sulatha V.
