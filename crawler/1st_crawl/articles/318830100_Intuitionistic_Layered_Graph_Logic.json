{"id":"318830100_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic","abstract":"Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic that gives an account of layering. As in other bunched systems, the logic includes the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give a soundness and completeness theorem for a labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. To demonstrate the utility of the logic, we show how to represent systems and security examples, illuminating the relationship between services/policies and the infrastructures/architectures to which they are applied.","authors":["Simon Docherty","David Pym"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.24963/ijcai.2017/673","Conference: Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["51724814_Rule-based_multi-level_modeling_of_cell_biological_systems","298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","220568189_A_theory_of_decomposition_into_prime_factors_of_layered_interconnection_networks","220217881_Topological_analysis_of_a_two_coupled_evolving_networks_model_for_business_systems","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI"]}
