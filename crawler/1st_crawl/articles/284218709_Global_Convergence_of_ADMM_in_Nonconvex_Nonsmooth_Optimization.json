{"id":"284218709_Global_Convergence_of_ADMM_in_Nonconvex_Nonsmooth_Optimization","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing a nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth\nobjective function, f(x) + h(y), subject to linear equality constraints that\ncouple $x$ and $y$. Both the functions $f$ and $h$ can be nonconvex, but $h$\nneeds to be smooth.\nThe developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions\nsuch as piecewise linear functions, $\\ell_q$ quasi-norm, Schatten-$q$\nquasi-norm ($0<q<1$) and SCAD, as well as the indicator functions of compact\nsmooth manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds). By\napplying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM\nalgorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning,\noptimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge.\nADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nWe present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges.\nBy this example and other analysis in this paper, ADMM is a much better choice\nthan ALM for nonconvex nonsmooth problems; not only is ADMM easier to\nimplement, it is also more likely to converge.","authors":["Yu Wang","Wotao Yin","Jinshan Zeng"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Scientific Computing 78(1â€“2)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-018-0757-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["320356932_Convergence_Rate_Analysis_of_Several_Splitting_Schemes","310517600_Parallel_Multi-Block_ADMM_with_o1_k_Convergence","321512672_Numerical_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Variational_Problems","312971601_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers_for_a_Class_of_Nonconvex_and_Nonsmooth_Problems_with_Applications_to_BackgroundForeground_Extraction","312113257_Self_Equivalence_of_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","308838169_Convergence_analysis_of_alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers_for_a_family_of_nonconvex_problems","301303774_Differences_of_two_semiconvex_functions_on_the_real_line","300713592_Distributed_ADMM-based_inference_in_large-scale_random_fields","282706520_A_non-convex_alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers_heuristic_for_optimal_power_flow","282539418_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers_for_ell_1hbox_-ell_2_l_1_-_l_2_-Regularized_Logistic_Regression_Model"]}
