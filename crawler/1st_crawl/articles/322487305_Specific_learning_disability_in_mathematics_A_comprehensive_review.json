{"id":"322487305_Specific_learning_disability_in_mathematics_A_comprehensive_review","abstract":"Math skills are necessary for success in the childhood educational and future adult work environment. This article reviews the changing terminology for specific learning disabilities (SLD) in math and describes the emerging genetics and neuroimaging studies that relate to individuals with math disability (MD). It is important to maintain a developmental perspective on MD, as presentation changes with age, instruction, and the different models (educational and medical) of identification. Intervention requires a systematic approach to screening and remediation that has evolved with more evidence-based literature. Newer directions in behavioral, educational and novel interventions are described.","authors":["Neelkamal Soares","Teresa Evans","Dr Rajendra Patel"],"meta":["January 2018Translational Pediatrics
