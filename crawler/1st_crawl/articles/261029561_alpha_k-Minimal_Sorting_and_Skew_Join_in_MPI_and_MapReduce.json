{"id":"261029561_alpha_k-Minimal_Sorting_and_Skew_Join_in_MPI_and_MapReduce","abstract":"As computer clusters are found to be highly effective for handling massive\ndatasets, the design of efficient parallel algorithms for such a computing\nmodel is of great interest. We consider ({\\alpha}, k)-minimal algorithms for\nsuch a purpose, where {\\alpha} is the number of rounds in the algorithm, and k\nis a bound on the deviation from perfect workload balance. We focus on new\n({\\alpha}, k)-minimal algorithms for sorting and skew equijoin operations for\ncomputer clusters. To the best of our knowledge the proposed sorting and skew\njoin algorithms achieve the best workload balancing guarantee when compared to\nprevious works. Our empirical study shows that they are close to optimal in\nworkload balancing. In particular, our proposed sorting algorithm is around 25%\nmore efficient than the state-of-the-art Terasort algorithm and achieves\nsignificantly more even workload distribution by over 50%.","authors":["Silu Huang","Ada W.
