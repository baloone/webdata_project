{"id":"320148486_Research_on_Blending_Learning_Flipped_Class_Model_in_Colleges_and_Universities_Based_on_Computational_Thinking_-_Database_Principles_for_Example","abstract":"Computational thinking is to use heuristic reasoning to seek the solution of the problem, and has a strong ability to innovate. In the teaching of computer courses, it is one of the important subjects of teaching research to cultivate students' computational thinking ability. The traditional teaching model ignores the cognitive role of the students, which is not conducive to the cultivation of students' innovative thinking and creative ability. Blending learning is an inevitable trend of development in the field of higher education, and a hot research topic in the field of education. Inspired by \"Database Principles\" course model at University of Missouri, Kansas City, a multi-dimensional blending learning flipped class model of computer courses in colleges and universities based on students' computational thinking ability is proposed to construct teaching model and design theoretical and practical teaching system and diversified teaching process evaluation system. In the course of \"Database Principles\", the teaching practice is carried out to verify the teaching effect.","authors":["Ai-Dong Fang","Guo-Long Chen","Zhi-Rang Cai","Lin Cui"],"meta":["August 2017Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 13(8):5747-5755","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2017.01024a"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","265051052_Motivation_and_cognitive_load_in_the_flipped_classroom_definition_rationale_and_a_call_for_research","259110284_Flipped_classroom_model_improves_graduate_student_performance_in_cardiovascular_respiratory_and_renal_physiology","234012276_Vodcasts_and_Active-Learning_Exercises_in_a_Flipped_Classroom_Model_of_a_Renal_Pharmacotherapy_Module"]}
