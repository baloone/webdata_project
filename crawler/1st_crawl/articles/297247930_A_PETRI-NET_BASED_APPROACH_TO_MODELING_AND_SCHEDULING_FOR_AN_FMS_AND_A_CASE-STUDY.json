{"id":"297247930_A_PETRI-NET_BASED_APPROACH_TO_MODELING_AND_SCHEDULING_FOR_AN_FMS_AND_A_CASE-STUDY","abstract":"In this paper, a timed-place Petri net (TPPN) model for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS's) is constructed, which contains two major submodels: stationary Transportation Model and variable Process-Flow Model. For multiple automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems, we embed a simple rule and introduce a push-AGV strategy in a TPPN model to solve the collision and traffic jam problems of vehicles. Since a firing sequence of the TPPN from the initial marking to the final marking can be seen as a schedule of the modeled FMS, by using an A* based search algorithm, namely, Limited-Expansion A algorithm, an effective schedule of the part processing can be obtained. To show the promising potential of the proposed work, a prototype FMS in Automation Laboratory of Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, is used as a target system for implementation. The experiment results assert that the job-shop scheduling problem can always be satisfactorily solved.","authors":["TH SUN","CW CHENG","LC FU"],"meta":["December 1994IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics 41(6):593-601"],"references":[]}
