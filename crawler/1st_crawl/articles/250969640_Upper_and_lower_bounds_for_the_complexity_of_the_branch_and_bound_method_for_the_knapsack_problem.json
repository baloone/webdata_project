{"id":"250969640_Upper_and_lower_bounds_for_the_complexity_of_the_branch_and_bound_method_for_the_knapsack_problem","abstract":"This paper is devoted to questions concerning the complexity of solution of the problem on one-dimensional Boolean knapsack by the branch and bound method. For this complexity, we obtain two upper bounds. We separate the special case of the knapsack problem where the complexity is polynomially bounded by the dimension of the problem. We also obtain an upper and lower bounds for the complexity of solution by the branch and bound method of the subset sum problem which is a special case of the knapsack problem.","authors":["R. M.
