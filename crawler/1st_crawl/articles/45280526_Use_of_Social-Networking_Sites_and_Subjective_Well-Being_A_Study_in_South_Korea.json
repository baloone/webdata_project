{"id":"45280526_Use_of_Social-Networking_Sites_and_Subjective_Well-Being_A_Study_in_South_Korea","abstract":"Social-networking sites (SNSs) provide users with a unique computer-mediated environment where individuals are able to disclose their thoughts, feelings, and experiences within their circle of personal ties. From a positive psychological perspective, this research investigated the use of SNSs and users' subjective well-being. The results show that although the time spent using a SNS is not related to well-being, the amount of self-disclosure on SNSs is positively related to subjective well-being. In addition, an individual's socioeconomic status is negatively related to self-disclosing behavior.","authors":["Gyudong Lee","Jaeeun Lee","Soon-Jae Kwon"],"meta":["March 2011Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking 14(3):151-5","DOI:10.1089/cyber.2009.0382","SourcePubMed"],"references":["259823204_Social_Network_Sites_Definition_History_and_Scholarship","237531711_Self-Presentation_in_Online_PersonalsThe_Role_of_Anticipated_Future_Interaction_Self-Disclosure_and_Perceived_Success_in_Internet_Dating","232577536_Subjective_Well-Being_Three_Decades_of_Progress","232558393_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Effects_on_Disclosure_Impressions_and_Interpersonal_Evaluations_Getting_to_Know_One_Another_a_Bit_at_a_Time","232557068_Implementing_a_Five-Factor_Personality_Inventory_for_Use_on_the_Internet","227761741_Is_There_Social_Capital_in_a_Social_Network_Site_Facebook_Use_and_College_Students'_Life_Satisfaction_Trust_and_Participation1","222436655_The_International_Personality_Item_Pool_and_the_Future_of_Public-Domain_Personality_Measures","220438224_The_Benefits_of_Facebook_Friends_Social_Capital_and_College_Students'_Use_of_Online_Social_Network_Sites","220438020_Social_Network_Sites_Definition_History_and_Scholarship","220260378_Understanding_Digital_Inequality_Comparing_Continued_Use_Behavioral_Models_of_the_Socio-Economically_Advantaged_and_Disadvantaged","51430121_Photograph_Use_on_Social_Network_Sites_among_South_Korean_College_Students_The_Role_of_Public_and_Private_Self-Consciousness","42788677_Self-disclosure_in_computer-mediated_communication_The_role_of_self-awareness_and_visual_anonymity","23545562_Achieving_Sustainable_Gains_in_Happiness_Change_Your_Actions_not_Your_Circumstances","11346051_On_the_Internet_No_One_Knows_I'm_an_Introvert_Extroversion_Neuroticism_and_Internet_Interaction","8408816_What_Do_You_Do_When_Things_Go_Right_The_Intrapersonal_and_Interpersonal_Benefits_of_Sharing_Positive_Events","7404119_The_Satisfaction_With_Life_Scale","297237526_A_family_process_model_of_economic_hardship_and_adjustment_of_early_adolescent_boys","272159642_The_Satisfaction_With_Life_Scale","256600143_The_Presentation_of_Self_In_Everyday_Life","247746188_Personality_Correlates_of_Subjective_Well-Being","247666459_Subjective_Well-Being_The_Science_of_Happiness_and_Life_Satisfaction","247167018_Social_connectedness_extraversion_and_subjective_well-being_Testing_a_mediation_model","238414997_Can_You_See_the_Real_Me_Activation_and_Expression_of_the_True_Self_on_the_Internet","235726247_Development_and_Validation_of_Brief_Measures_of_Positive_and_Negative_Affect_The_PANAS_Scales","228641746_An_Evolutionary_Approach_to_the_Extraversion_Continuum","222744400_The_Relationship_Between_Extraversion_and_Neuroticism_and_the_Different_Uses_of_the_Internet","222545699_Personality_and_motivation_associated_with_Facebook_use","220495485_Individual_differences_in_Internet_usage_motives","220426929_The_impact_of_Internet_use_on_the_other_side_of_the_digital_divide","200031149_Social_Capital_in_the_Creation_of_Human_Capital","51992865_Social_Capital_in_The_Creation_of_Human_Capital","36928484_The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life","23767668_Can_Blogging_Enhance_Subjective_Well-Being_Through_Self-Disclosure","23653057_Blogging_as_a_Social_Tool_A_Psychosocial_Examination_of_the_Effects_of_Blogging","21554551_A_Family_Process_Model_of_Economic_Hardship_and_Adjustment_of_Early_Adolescent_Boys","19758199_Watson_D_Clark_LA_Tellegen_A_Development_and_Validation_of_Brief_Measures_of_Positive_and_Negative_Affect_-_the_Panas_Scales_J_Pers_Soc_Psychol_54_1063-1070","13301040_Empirical_foundations_for_writing_in_prevention_and_psychotherapy_Mental_and_physical_health_outcomes","6500995_Motivations_and_Self-Presentation_Strategies_on_Korean-Based_Cyworld_Weblog_Format_Personal_Homepages"]}
