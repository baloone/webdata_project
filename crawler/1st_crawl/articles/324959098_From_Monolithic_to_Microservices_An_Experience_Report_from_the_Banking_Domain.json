{"id":"324959098_From_Monolithic_to_Microservices_An_Experience_Report_from_the_Banking_Domain","abstract":"Microservices have seen their popularity blossoming with an explosion of concrete applications in real-life software. Several companies are currently involved in a major refactoring of their back-end systems in order to improve scalability. This article presents an experience report of a real-world case study, from the banking domain, in order to demonstrate how scalability is positively affected by reimplementing a monolithic architecture into microservices. The case study is based on the FX Core system for converting from one currency to another. FX Core is a mission-critical system of Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark and one of the leading financial institutions in Northern Europe.","authors":["Antonio Bucchiarone","Nicola Dragoni","Schahram Dustdar","Stephan T.
