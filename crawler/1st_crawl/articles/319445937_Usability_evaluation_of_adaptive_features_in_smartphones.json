{"id":"319445937_Usability_evaluation_of_adaptive_features_in_smartphones","abstract":"This paper presents a usability study that aims to analyze effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction based on the existing adaptive features in smartphones. The adaptive features include screen rotation, voice commands, LED notifications and kid mode for android and iOS platforms. The effectiveness and efficiency are measured by considering task completion within a specific time while satisfaction is measured through After Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) technique. The experiment is carried out with the involvement of 128 participants. The study shows interesting patterns in usability where screen rotation and voice commands resulted in lower usability. Whereas, LED notifications is a dominant feature having almost 88% effectiveness comparing to a non-adaptive environment. Finally, the study suggests that the adaptive features must be applied after careful analysis of user tasks and context.","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Iqbal","Nadeem Ahmad","Syed Khuram Shahzad"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 112:2185-2194","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.258"],"references":["322653250_The_Application_of_Real-Time_Voice_Recognition_to_Control_Critical_Mobile_Device_Operations","306263450_How_Age_and_Gender_Affect_Smartphone_Usage","305458785_Context-Based_Mobile_User_Interface","291618379_Silence_Your_Phones_Smartphone_Notifications_Increase_Inattention_and_Hyperactivity_Symptoms","281006272_Human-Computer_Interaction_Overview_on_State_of_the_Art","277606386_Smart_Phone_Application_Evaluation_with_Usability_Testing_Approach","320899954_Smartphones_and_Child_Injuries","306261138_Response_Time_Analysis_of_Text-Based_CAPTCHA_by_Association_Rules","306127320_Physical_modeling_of_oil_charging_in_tight_reservoirs_A_case_study_of_Permian_Lucaogou_Formation_in_Jimsar_Sag_Junggar_Basin_NW_China","281006273_Human-Computer_Interaction_Overview_on_State_Art"]}
