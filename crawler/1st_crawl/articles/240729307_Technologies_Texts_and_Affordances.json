{"id":"240729307_Technologies_Texts_and_Affordances","abstract":"In contrast to recent sociological emphases on the social shaping of technology, this article proposes and illustrates a way of analysing the technological shaping of sociality. Drawing on the concept of affordances (Gibson 1979), the article argues for a recognition of the constraining, as well as enabling, materiality of artefacts. The argument is set in the theoretical context of one of the most recent and comprehensive statements of anti-essentialism (Grint and Woolgar 1997). The position is illustrated through a reinterpretation of some case studies used by proponents of the radical constructivist position.","authors":["Ian Hutchby"],"meta":["May 2001Sociology 35(2):441-456","DOI:10.1017/S0038038501000219","Project: Conversation Analysis"],"references":["324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","290128799_The_configuration_of_domestic_practices_in_the_designing_of_household_appliances","284539688_Garfinkel_and_Ethnomethodology","275944148_Labor_and_Monopoly_Capital_The_Degradation_of_Work_in_the_Twentieth_Century","274648144_Alienation_and_Freedom","273044837_Science_as_Practice_and_Culture_Andrew_Pickering","270192180_Scientific_Practice_and_Ordinary_Action","269903416_The_Third_Wave","265092361_The_Social_Shaping_of_Technology","259257629_General_Introduction"]}
