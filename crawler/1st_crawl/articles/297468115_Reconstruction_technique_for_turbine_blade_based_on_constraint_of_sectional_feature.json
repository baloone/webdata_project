{"id":"297468115_Reconstruction_technique_for_turbine_blade_based_on_constraint_of_sectional_feature","abstract":"To solve the problem of establishing digital model of turbine blade for product modifications, aerodynamic optimization, blade repairing and other practical engineering, the technology of constraint on sectional feature and 2D sketch are applied to reconstruct curved surface model. For turbine blade geometry and aerodynamic design requirements, turbine blade section curve point cloud slices are layered to express as the difference curves and fitted in stages. Based on constraint technology about curve geometry features of 2D sketch, the curved surface that meets the constraint and approaching the data point is constructed. The result shows that the reverse engineering technology based on the cross section feature constraints technique and forward design technique can quickly and accurately construct complex surface and improve the efficiency of reverse modeling and provide a method for rapid reconstruction model.","authors":["W.
