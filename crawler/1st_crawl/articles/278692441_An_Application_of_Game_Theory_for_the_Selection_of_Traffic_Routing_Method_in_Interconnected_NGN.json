{"id":"278692441_An_Application_of_Game_Theory_for_the_Selection_of_Traffic_Routing_Method_in_Interconnected_NGN","abstract":"In this paper, the impact of various dynamic traffic routing methods on different performances of interconnected telecommunications network with the application of bill-and-keep interconnection charging is presented. For the purpose of our research, we developed the software for Routing and Interconnection Simulation (RIS). We conducted two-stage analysis. First stage is concerning the shortest path routing, the three-hop routing, the random path routing and the last successful path routing, and their influence on certain network performance parameters. In second stage the coordination game theory model is proposed in order to determine the one routing method that provides the best results for all operators in terms of costs per link.","authors":["Aleksandra Kostic-Ljubisavljevic","Vesna Radonjic","Snezana Mladenovic","V.
