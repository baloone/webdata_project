{"id":"305472574_EWCDM_An_Efficient_Beyond-Birthday_Secure_Nonce-Misuse_Resistant_MAC","abstract":"We propose a nonce-based MAC construction called EWCDM (Encrypted Wegman-Carter with Davies-Meyer), based on an almost xor-universal hash function and a block cipher, with the following properties: (i) it is simple and efficient, requiring only two calls to the block cipher, one of which can be carried out in parallel to the hash function computation; (ii) it is provably secure beyond the birthday bound when nonces are not reused; (iii) it provably retains security up to the birthday bound in case of nonce misuse. Our construction is a simple modification of the Encrypted Wegman-Carter construction, which is known to achieve only (i) and (iii) when based on a block cipher. Underlying our new construction is a new PRP-to-PRF conversion method coined Encrypted Davies-Meyer, which turns a pair of secret random permutations into a function which is provably indistinguishable from a perfectly random function up to at least \\(2^{2n/3}\\) queries, where n is the bit-length of the domain of the permutations.","authors":["Beno√Æt Cogliati","Yannick Seurin"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53018-4_5","Conference: Annual Cryptology Conference"],"references":["312830018_Twisted_Polynomials_and_Forgery_Attacks_on_GCM","262368243_3kf9_Enhancing_3GPP-MAC_beyond_the_birthday_bound","225650991_MAC_Reforgeability","221355013_Stateless_Evaluation_of_Pseudorandom_Functions_Security_Beyond_the_Birthday_Barrier","221347837_Domain_Extension_for_MACs_Beyond_the_Birthday_Barrier","220336460_The_Power_of_Verification_Queries_in_Message_Authentication_and_Authenticated_Encryption","220333126_FRMAC_a_Fast_Randomized_Message_Authentication_Code","2914831_Building_PRFs_from_PRPs","2375849_A_Tool_for_Obtaining_Tighter_Security_Analyses_of_Pseudorandom_Function_Based_Constructions_With_Applications_to_PRP-PRF_conversion","313643077_Keying_hash_function_for_message_authentication","312833936_The_Indistinguishability_of_the_XOR_of_k_Permutations","283868041_On_Weak_Keys_and_Forgery_Attacks_Against_Polynomial-Based_MAC_Schemes","267665553_Tight_Security_Bounds_for_Key-Alternating_Ciphers","267653281_Minimizing_the_Two-Round_Even-Mansour_Cipher","262165957_Cycling_attacks_on_GCM_GHASH_and_other_polynomial_MACs_and_hashes","245681772_Codes_Which_Detect_Deception","245623885_CBC_MACs_for_Arbitrary-Length_The_Three-Key_Constructions","240832563_Polynomial_evaluation_and_message_authentication","228994076_Authentication_failures_in_NIST_version_of_GCM","225389624_CWC_A_High-Performance_Conventional_Authenticated_Encryption_Mode","225177919_The_Sum_of_PRPs_Is_a_Secure_PRF","225144252_Luby-Rackoff_Backwards_Increasing_Security_by_Making_Block_Ciphers_Non-Invertible","222466434_New_hash_functions_and_their_use_in_authentication_and_set_equality","222080693_The_Security_of_the_Cipher_Block_Chaining_Message_Authentication_Code","221443870_Pseudorandom_permutations_based_on_the_DES_scheme","221355325_Key-Recovery_Attacks_on_Universal_Hash_Function_Based_MAC_Algorithms","221355259_Improved_security_analyses_for_CBC_MACs","221355229_A_New_Variant_of_PMAC_Beyond_the_Birthday_Bound","221355161_On_Computationally_Secure_Authentication_Tags_Requiring_Short_Secret_Shared_Keys","221355038_UMAC_Fast_and_Secure_Message_Authentication","221354856_New_Results_on_Pseudorandom_Permutation_Generators_Based_on_the_DES_Scheme","221354647_LFSR-based_Hashing_and_Authentication","221348731_Stronger_Security_Bounds_for_Wegman-Carter-Shoup_Authenticators","221347851_The_Security_of_Triple_Encryption_and_a_Framework_for_Code-Based_Game-Playing_Proofs","221274785_The_Coefficients_H_Technique","221208398_The_Sum_of_CBC_MACs_Is_a_Secure_PRF","220990610_A_Proof_of_Security_in_O2_n_for_the_Xor_of_Two_Random_Permutations","220942647_The_Poly1305-AES_message-authentication_code","220942377_How_to_Thwart_Birthday_Attacks_against_MACs_via_Small_Randomness","220833742_Fast_Universal_Hashing_with_Small_Keys_and_No_Preprocessing_The_PolyR_Construction","220332978_On_the_Security_of_Randomized_CBC-MAC_Beyond_the_Birthday_Paradox_Limit_A_New_Construction","2941479_The_Security_and_Performance_of_the_GaloisCounter_Mode_GCM_of_Operation","2699794_On_Fast_and_Provably_Secure_Message_Authentication_Based_on_Universal_Hashing","2566899_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2560142_Bucket_Hashing_and_Its_Application_to_Fast_Message_Authentication","2366934_Floating-Point_Arithmetic_And_Message_Authentication","2290039_Keying_Hash_Functions_for_Message_Authentication","2259169_MMH_Software_Message_Authentication_in_the_Gbitsecond_Rates"]}
