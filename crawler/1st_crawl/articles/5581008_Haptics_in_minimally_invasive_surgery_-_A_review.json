{"id":"5581008_Haptics_in_minimally_invasive_surgery_-_A_review","abstract":"This article gives an overview of research performed in the field of haptic information feedback during minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Literature has been consulted from 1985 to present. The studies show that currently, haptic information feedback is rare, but promising, in MIS. Surgeons benefit from additional feedback about force information. When it comes to grasping forces and perceiving slip, little is known about the advantages additional haptic information can give to prevent tissue trauma during manipulation. Improvement of haptic perception through augmented haptic information feedback in MIS might be promising.","authors":["Eleonora Westebring","Richard Goossens","Jack J Jakimowicz","Jenny Dankelman"],"meta":["February 2008Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies: MITAT: official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy 17(1):3-16","DOI:10.1080/13645700701820242","SourcePubMed"],"references":["286316700_Development_of_5mm-trocar_laparoscopic_forceps_with_mechanical_force_feedback","268357431_Visually_Perceived_Force_Feedback_in_Simulated_Robotic_Surgery","252967354_MultiChannel_Vibrotactile_Display_for_Teleoperated_Assembly","315615714_Dynamic_Augmented_Reality_for_Sensory_Substitution_in_Robot-Assisted_Surgical_Systems","285412710_Erratum_Virtual_reality_surgical_laparoscopic_simulators","281324512_The_role_of_force_feedback_in_surgery_Analysis_of_blunt_dissection_haptic_interfaces_for_virtual_environment_and_teleoperator_systems_2002","280765655_Telerobotic_response_requirements","277502880_Reliable_and_Enhanced_Stiffness_Perception_in_Soft-tissue_Telemanipulation","276949230_Design_and_Application_of_Compliant_Mechanisms_for_Surgical_Tools","269197382_SensorActuator_Asymmetries_in_Telemanipulators_Implications_of_Partial_Force_Feedback"]}
