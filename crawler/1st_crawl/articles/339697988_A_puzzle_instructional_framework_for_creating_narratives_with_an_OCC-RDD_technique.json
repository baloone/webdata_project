{"id":"339697988_A_puzzle_instructional_framework_for_creating_narratives_with_an_OCC-RDD_technique","abstract":"This paper presents a puzzle instructional framework comprising different types of puzzles for creating narratives with a technique called OCC-RDD. To demonstrate its application, the procedural map generation was chosen as an object to be explored in an introductory way. The intended context of application is the teaching of Computer Science contents to students of Digital Games. Puzzles are important challenging tools and can help developing critical thinking. This article shows how puzzles can help writing more efficient narratives comprising types of OCC's scenes such as the Objective, the Conflict and the Catastrophe. The following types of puzzles are proposed to be introduced into the narratives: Riddle, Lateral Thinking, Spatial Reasoning, Pattern Recognition, Logic, Exploration and Item Use. The challenges created by the puzzles are thought to motivate and engage undergraduate students of Digital Game Courses and other Computer Science related courses in learning specific computational contents and help teachers to achieve their instructional objectives.","authors":["Mario Madureira Fontes","Italo Santiago Vega"],"meta":["September 2016","Project: TÃ©cnica OC2-RD2: estruturas narrativas em cursos de desenvolvimento de software"],"references":["311472808_Storytelling_and_puzzles_in_a_software_engineering_course","233063732_A_puzzle-based_seminar_for_computer_engineering_freshmen1","224232404_Search-Based_Procedural_Content_Generation_A_Taxonomy_and_Survey","220033160_A_Computational_Teaching_Approach_Through_the_Use_of_a_Narrative_Technique_and_a_Comic_Strip","345934076_Why_Students_Leave_Engineering_The_Unexpected_Bond","274098053_Adaptive_Specifications_and_Emotions_Model_of_Narrative_Generation_for_Interactive_Learning_Environments","266653024_Engaging_students_by_intertwining_puzzle-based_and_problem-based_learning","258948784_How_to_Solve_It_A_New_Aspect_of_Mathematical_Method","224130233_Puzzle-Based_Learning_for_Engineering_and_Computer_Science","220477659_Puzzling_Problems_in_Computer_Engineering"]}
