{"id":"325334109_d_e-Ball_Approximation_of_a_Shape_Definition_and_Complexity","abstract":"Given a set S in Rn, a (δ,ε)-ball approximation of S is defined as a collection of balls that covers the morphological erosion of S (by a ball of radius ε) and remains inside the morphological dilation of S (by a ball of radius δ). We study the problem of computing a (δ,ε)-ball approximation when S is itself defined as a finite union of balls. This problem relates to geometric set cover problems but is however different in nature. It offers a new framework for reducing the size of a collection of balls while controlling both the inner and outer distance to the shape. We prove that computing a (δ,ε)-ball approximation of minimum cardinality is NP-complete for n = 2. Along the way, we study the boundary of unions of disks and their erosion, for which we derive a computational description.","authors":["Dominique Attali","Tuong-Bach Nguyen","Isabelle Sivignon"],"meta":["May 2018Discrete & Computational Geometry 61(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-018-0019-8"],"references":["306080023_Epsilon-covering_a_greedy_optimal_algorithm_for_simple_shapes","321593340_New_Trends_in_Discrete_and_Computational_Geometry","314751842_Discrete_scale_axis_representations_for_3D_geometry","277338114_Structural_characterization_of_particle_systems_using_spherical_harmonics","268755967_Packing_and_covering_with_incongruent_circles","267147479_Geometric_Approximation_Algorithms","266656383_Near-Linear_Algorithms_for_Geometric_Hitting_Sets_and_Set_Covers","265217039_Exact_and_Efficient_Construction_of_Planar_Arrangements_of_Circular_Arcs_and_Line_Segments_with_Applications_1","264960216_Image_analysis_and_mathematical_morphology_English_version_rev_by_Noel_Cressie","264947516_A_PTAS_for_the_disk_cover_problem_of_geometric_objects","264907677_The_l_-medial_axis","263986772_MAXIMIZING_THE_AREA_OF_OVERLAP_OF_TWO_UNIONS_OF_DISKS_UNDER_RIGID_MOTION","260801453_Greedy_Geometric_Algorithms_for_Collection_of_Balls_with_Applications_to_Geometric_Approximation_and_Molecular_Coarse-Graining","248390470_Algebraic_Topology","243075688_Curvature_Measures"]}
