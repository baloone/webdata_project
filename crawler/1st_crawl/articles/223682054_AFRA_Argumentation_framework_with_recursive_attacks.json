{"id":"223682054_AFRA_Argumentation_framework_with_recursive_attacks","abstract":"The issue of representing attacks to attacks in argumentation is receiving an increasing attention as a useful conceptual modelling tool in several contexts. In this paper we present AFRA, a formalism encompassing unlimited recursive attacks within argumentation frameworks. AFRA satisfies the basic requirements of definition simplicity and rigorous compatibility with Dungâ€™s theory of argumentation. This paper provides a complete development of the AFRA formalism complemented by illustrative examples and a detailed comparison with other recursive attack formalizations.","authors":["Pietro Baroni","Federico Cerutti","Massimiliano Giacomin","Giovanni Guida"],"meta":["January 2011International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 52(1):19-37","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2010.05.004","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["228470947_Attack_relations_among_dynamic_coalitions","228653271_Answer-set_programming_encodings_for_argumentation_frameworks","227732875_On_bipolarity_in_argumentation_frameworks","226561196_Semantics_of_Abstract_Argument_Systems","222779172_On_principle-based_evaluation_of_extension-based_argumentation_semantics","222777728_Skepticism_relations_for_comparing_argumentation_semantics","222699785_Reasoning_about_preferences_in_argumentation_frameworks","222665948_Audiences_in_argumentation_frameworks","222565691_Preference-based_argumentation_Arguments_supporting_multiple_values","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1"]}
