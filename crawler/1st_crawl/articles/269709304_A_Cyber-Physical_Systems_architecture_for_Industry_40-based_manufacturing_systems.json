{"id":"269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","abstract":"Recent advances in manufacturing industry has paved way for a systematical deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical factory floor and the cyber computational space. Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS.","authors":["Jay Lee","Behrad Bagheri","Hung-An Kao"],"meta":["December 2014Manufacturing Letters 3","DOI:10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001"],"references":["285163697_Industry_40_in_Big_Data_Environment","271400673_Enhancing_the_Motor_Skills_of_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Pool-based_Approach","271270922_Predictive_Manufacturing_System_-_Trends_of_Next-Generation_Production_Systems","262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","228934884_A_Survey_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems","224358895_A_similarity-based_prognostics_approach_for_Remaining_Useful_Life_estimation_of_engineered_systems","284034181_Cyber-physical_systems","220476010_Cyber-Physical_Systems"]}
