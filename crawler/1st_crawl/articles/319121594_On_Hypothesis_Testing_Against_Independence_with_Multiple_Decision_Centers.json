{"id":"319121594_On_Hypothesis_Testing_Against_Independence_with_Multiple_Decision_Centers","abstract":"A distributed binary hypothesis testing problem is studied with one observer and two decision centers. The type-II error exponents region is derived for testing against independence when the observer communicates with the two decision centers over one common and two individual noise-free bit pipes. When there is only a common noise-free bit pipe, the type-II error exponents region is derived for testing against conditional independence. Finally, when the observer can communicate to the two decision centers over a discrete memoryless broadcast channel, an achievable type-II error exponents region is derived for testing against conditional independence. The last type-II error exponent is obtained by splitting the observations into subblocks, having the transmitter apply hybrid joint source-channel coding with side-information independently to each subblock, and having each receiver apply a Neyman-Pearson test jointly over the subblocks. This decision approach avoids introducing further error exponents due to the binning or the decoding procedures.","authors":["Sadaf Salehkalaibar","Michele Wigger","Roy Timo"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2798659"],"references":["312908419_Hypothesis_Testing_under_Maximal_Leakage_Privacy_Constraints","284731953_Distributed_Testing_Against_Independence_With_Conferencing_Encoders","274312507_Distributed_Testing_Against_Independence_with_Multiple_Terminals","272376598_A_Unified_Approach_to_Hybrid_Coding","319374845_Distributed_hypothesis_testing_over_noisy_channels","310500692_Testing_against_independence_with_multiple_decision_centers","301878949_Collaborative_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing","277209850_Improved_Source_Coding_Exponents_via_Witsenhausen's_Rate","266908024_Network_Information_Theory","261116467_Interactive_hypothesis_testing_against_independence"]}
