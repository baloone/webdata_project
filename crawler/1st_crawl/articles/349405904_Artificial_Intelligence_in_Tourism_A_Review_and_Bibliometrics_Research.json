{"id":"349405904_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Tourism_A_Review_and_Bibliometrics_Research","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) came up as an ambiguous concept from computer sciences and now it is being used in many areas of our life. It has stimulated academia’s interest due to its alternative insights into complex problems. Therefore, a bibliometric method was applied in this study to observe the progress of AI in the tourism field. A total of 102 papers were collected from Scopus database. Key factors such as most productive authors, collaborations and institutions were identified, and research hotspots were determined using co-occurrence network and most common author keywords. Progress of AI was visualized with thematic evolution analysis. Findings indicate that there is a progressive interest in AI after 2017, and average citations signify that papers are highly cited. Since this is the first study conducting a bibliometric on AI in the tourism context, it could be considered useful for academics and tourism professionals as it provides general overview of AI, demonstrates research trends and popular papers.","authors":["I.
