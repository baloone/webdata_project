{"id":"326214652_Flatness-based_Adaptive_Sliding_Mode_Tracking_Control_for_a_Quadrotor_with_Disturbances","abstract":"In this paper, a flatness-based adaptive sliding mode control strategy is presented to solve the trajectory tracking problem of a quadrotor. According to the differential flatness theory, the typical under-actuated quadrotor dynamics is transformed into a fully-actuated one. Based on this model, backstepping sliding mode controllers are designed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. To improve the robustness to disturbances, extended state observers are applied as a feedforward compensation of disturbances. Moreover, considering the high-order dynamics and possible instability caused by large observer gains, the adaptive method is applied to compensate for the estimation error. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified in simulations.","authors":["Dailiang Ma","Yuanqing Xia","Ganghui Shen","Zhiqiang Jia"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of the Franklin Institute 355(14)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.06.018"],"references":["321233542_Differential_Flatness_of_Quadrotor_Dynamics_Subject_to_Rotor_Drag_for_Accurate_Tracking_of_High-Speed_Trajectories","309066345_Robust_Control_for_Quadrotors_With_Multiple_Time-Varying_Uncertainties_and_Delays"]}
