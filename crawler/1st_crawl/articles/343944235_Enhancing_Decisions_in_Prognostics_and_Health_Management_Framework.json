{"id":"343944235_Enhancing_Decisions_in_Prognostics_and_Health_Management_Framework","abstract":"Prognostics and health management have become increasingly important in recent years. Many research studies focus on a crucial phase consisting of predicting the remaining useful life of equipment or a component. However, this step is often carried out without taking into account the decisions that will be taken later. This article aims to propose a modification of the existing PHM framework to combine the prognostics and decision-making phases in a closed loop. In this paper, the presented framework is described and some elements for its implementation are proposed. A simplified example is developed to illustrate the presented methodology of post-prognostic decision enhancement.","authors":["Omar Bougacha","Christophe Varnier","Noureddine Zerhouni"],"meta":["August 2020International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management 11(1)","Project: Decision Enhanced Prognostic Approach"],"references":["320441136_Exact_and_heuristic_algorithms_for_post_prognostic_decision_in_a_single_multifunctional_machine","317584659_Maintenance-Based_Prognostics_of_Nuclear_Plant_Equipment_for_Long-Term_Operation","316649317_Joint_optimization_of_train_assignment_and_predictive_maintenance_scheduling","314111042_Manufacturing_system_maintenance_based_on_dynamic_programming_model_with_prognostics_information","313809654_Post-Prognostics_Decision_Making_in_Distributed_MEMS-Based_Systems","325222504_Battery_Health_Management_for_Small-size_Rotary-wing_Electric_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_An_Efficient_Approach_for_Constrained_Computing_Platforms","324009077_Integrated_production_quality_control_and_condition-based_maintenance_for_imperfect_production_systems","316600054_From_Prognostics_and_Health_Systems_Management_to_Predictive_Maintenance_1_Monitoring_and_Prognostics","315773020_Prognostics_The_Science_of_Making_Predictions","315597806_Quantitative_risk_prognostics_framework_based_on_Petri_Net_and_Bow-Tie_models"]}
