{"id":"315662067_Sorting_Algorithms_-_A_Comparative_Study","abstract":"Sorting is nothing but alphabetizing, categorizing, arranging or putting items in an ordered sequence. It is a key fundamental operation in the field of computer science. It is of extreme importance because it adds usefulness to data. In this papers, we have compared five important sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Selection, Insertion and Merge). We have developed a program in C# and experimented with the input values 1-150, 1-300 and 1-950. The performance and efficiency of these algorithms in terms of CPU time consumption has been recorded and presented in tabular and graphical form.","authors":["Naeem Akhter","Muhammad Idrees","Furqan-ur-Rehman"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 14(12):930-936"],"references":["274640372_A_Comparative_Study_between_Various_Sorting_Algorithms","260632469_Comparison_of_Sorting_Algorithms_based_on_Input_Sequences","220413720_An_Enhancement_of_Major_Sorting_Algorithms","200034374_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms"]}
