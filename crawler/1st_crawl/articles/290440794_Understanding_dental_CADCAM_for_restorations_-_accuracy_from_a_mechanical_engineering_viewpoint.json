{"id":"290440794_Understanding_dental_CADCAM_for_restorations_-_accuracy_from_a_mechanical_engineering_viewpoint","abstract":"As is the case in the field of medicine, as well as in most areas of daily life, digital technology is increasingly being introduced into dental practice. Computer-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) solutions are available not only for chairside practice but also for creating inlays, crowns, fixed partial dentures (FPDs), implant abutments, and other dental prostheses. CAD/CAM dental practice can be considered as the handling of devices and software processing for the almost automatic design and creation of dental restorations. However, dentists who want to use dental CAD/CAM systems often do not have enough information to understand the variations offered by such technology practice. Knowledge of the random and systematic errors in accuracy with CAD/CAM systems can help to achieve successful restorations with this technology, and help with the purchasing of a CAD/CAM system that meets the clinical needs of restoration. This article provides a mechanical engineering viewpoint of the accuracy of CAD/CAM systems, to help dentists understand the impact of this technology on restoration accuracy.","authors":["Laurent Tapie","Nicolas Lebon","Kwamivi Bernardin Mawussi","Helene Fron Chabouis"],"meta":["December 2015International Journal of Computerized Dentistry 18(4):343-367","Projects: Assesment and Development of CAD/CAM for restorative dentistryProperties of dental machinable materials"],"references":["261624157_Computer-aided_Framework_Design_for_Digital_Dentistry","256288255_Computerized_technology_for_restorative_dentistry","222557394_Three-dimensional_optical_measurements_and_reverse_engineering_for_automotive_applications","221864769_Pre-Processing_of_Point-Data_from_Contact_and_Optical_3D_Digitization_Sensors","221503328_Influence_of_Surface_Material_on_the_Quality_of_Laser_Triangulation_Digitized_Point_Clouds_for_Reverse_Engineering_Tasks","51836518_The_Future_of_Dental_Devices_is_Digital","46404436_Volumetric_Determination_of_the_Amount_of_Misfit_in_CADCAM_and_Cast_Implant_Frameworks_A_Multicenter_Laboratory_Study","24195878_A_review_of_dental_CADCAM_Current_status_and_future_perspectives_from_20_years_of_experience","5381340_Digital_dentistry_An_overview_of_recent_developments_for_CADCAM_generated_restorations","300102177_A_New_Approach_to_Interpolation_of_Tool_Path_Trajectories_with_Piecewise_Defined_Clothoids","297585334_Evaluation_of_the_accuracy_of_CADCAM_crowns_fabricated_using_CT_images","281323351_A_Customized_Smart_CAM_System_for_Digital_Dentistry","278692886_Digital_Design_and_Fabrication_in_Dentistry","273112858_Understanding_dental_CADCAM_for_restorations_-_the_digital_workflow_from_a_mechanical_engineering_viewpoint","264827711_Scanning_accuracy_and_precision_in_4_intraoral_scanners_An_in_vitro_comparison_based_on_3-dimensional_analysis","263744006_A_3-Dimensional_accuracy_analysis_of_chairside_CADCAM_milling_processes","263322922_A_Systematic_Review_of_CADCAM_fit_restoration_evaluations","260840236_A_comparison_of_the_marginal_fit_of_crowns_fabricated_with_digital_and_conventional_methods","259122112_Comparative_analysis_on_measuring_performances_of_dental_intraoral_and_extraoral_optical_3D_digitization_systems","258687932_3D_Scanning_of_specular_and_diffuse_metallic_surfaces_using_an_infrared_technique","257203956_Assessment_of_the_accuracy_and_reliability_of_new_3-dimensional_scanning_devices","245573113_3-D_Modeling_for_Teeth_Correction_on_the_Basis_of_Optical_Measurement","231861518_Similarity_measure_for_quality_control_of_dental_CADCAM-applications","229344257_Multi-beam_laser_probe_for_measuring_position_and_orientation_of_freeform_surface","225811623_The_feature-based_posterior_crown_design_in_a_dental_CADCAM_system","223699008_Constant_cusp_height_tool_paths_as_geodesic_parallels_on_an_abstract_Riemannian_manifold","223601473_Derivation_of_machine_tool_error_models_and_error_compensation_procedure_for_three_axes_vertical_machining_center_using_rigid_body_kinematics","222348802_A_study_of_the_impact_of_machine_tool_structure_on_machining_processes","220839307_Modeling_of_a_Fitting_Inlay_from_Various_Informations","220584079_A_novel_3D_morphing_approach_for_tooth_occlusal_surface_reconstruction","51745681_Clinical_fitting_of_CADCAM_zirconia_single_crowns_generated_from_digital_intraoral_impressions_based_on_active_wavefront_sampling","51702592_Three-dimensional_fit_of_CADCAM-made_zirconia_copings","23314070_3D_surface_imaging_in_dentistry_-_What_we_are_looking_at","7977343_Generation_of_functional_Cerec_3D_occlusal_surfaces_a_comparison_of_two_production_methods_relevant_in_practice","7696250_Biogeneric_tooth_A_new_mathematical_representation_for_tooth_morphology_in_lower_first_molars","7099782_Surface_integrity_and_removal_mechanism_in_simulated_dental_finishing_of_a_feldspathic_porcelain","6875501_Use_of_CADCAM_technology_to_fabricate_a_removable_partial_denture_framework","6523017_Interactive_Tooth_Segmentation_of_Dental_Models"]}
