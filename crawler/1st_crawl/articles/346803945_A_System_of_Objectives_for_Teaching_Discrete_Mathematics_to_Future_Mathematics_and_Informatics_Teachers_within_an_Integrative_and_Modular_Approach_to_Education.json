In particular, the multilevel system of purposes of continuous teaching discrete mathematics according to the scheme “school — bachelor — master” is constructed. The role of discrete mathematics in the modern world, science and education is analyzed. The necessity of introduction to the basic questions of discrete content line of schoolchildren and students is justified. The place of discipline “Discrete Mathematics” in the system of modern domestic general and higher education is revealed. Methodical expediency of development and implementation in the pedagogical practice of continuous learning methods of discrete mathematics in the system “school — bachelor — master” on the basis of integrative-modular approach to the organization of the educational process is justified. Based on the basic provisions of the competence approach, guided by the principles of fundamentality, continuity, integrativeness, professional orientation and modularity, a multi-level model of subject competencies — a system of goals for teaching discrete mathematics to future teachers of mathematics and computer sciences has been developed. The issues of practical implementation of the developed method are considered.","authors":["Ivan Deza","L. V. Kotova","D. L.
