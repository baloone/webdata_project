First, a link based dynamic network loading model is developed to simulate the traffic flow propagation allowing the change of speed limits. Shockwave propagation is well defined and captured by checking the difference between the queue forming end and the dissipation end. Second, the dynamic speed limit problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solved by a real time control mechanism. The speed limit controller is modeled as an intelligent agent interacting with the stochastic network environment stochastic network environment to assign time dependent link based speed limits. Based on different metrics, e.g. total network throughput, delay time, vehicular emissions are optimized in the modeling framework, the optimal speed limit scheme is obtained by applying the R-Markov Average Reward Technique (R-MART) based reinforcement learning algorithm. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is constructed to test the performance of the model. Results show that the total travel time and emissions (in terms of CO) are reduced by around 18% and 20% compared with the base case of non-speed limit control.","authors":["Feng Zhu","Satish V Ukkusuri"],"meta":["April 2014Transportation Research Part C Emerging Technologies 41:30â€“47","DOI:10.1016/j.trc.2014.01.014"],"references":["261171536_Identification_and_Calibration_of_Site-Specific_Stochastic_Freeway_Breakdown_and_Queue_Discharge","247898911_Relaxing_the_multivariate_normality_assumption_in_the_simulation_of_transportation_system_dependencies_An_old_technique_in_a_new_domain","245561786_Implementing_the_Concept_of_Reliability_for_Highway_Capacity_Analysis","238319435_Simulation-Based_Optimization_Parametric_Optimization_Techniques_and_Reinforcement_Learning","237320737_Propagation_of_uncertainty_in_transportation_land_use_models_-_Investigation_of_DRAM-EMPAL_and_UTPP_predictions_in_Austin_Texas","228719811_Coordinated_and_integrated_control_of_motorway_networks_via_non-linear_optimal_control","224857527_Assessment_of_the_impact_of_speed_limit_reduction_and_traffic_signal_coordination_on_vehicle_emissions_using_an_integrated_approach","28360292_The_Link_Transmission_Model_for_dynamic_network_loading","27515835_Effects_of_Weather-Controlled_Variable_Message_Signing_on_Driver_Behaviour","3427844_Freeway_Ramp_Metering_An_Overview","2853855_The_Propagation_Of_Uncertainty_Through_Travel_Demand_Models_An_Exploratory_Analysis","285308043_Reliability_of_freeway_traffic_flow_A_stochastic_concept_of_capacity","270812994_Efficiency_and_equity_of_speed_limits_in_transportation_networks","263443536_Integration_of_Environmental_Objectives_in_a_System_Optimal_Dynamic_Traffic_Assignment_Model","257044482_The_impact_of_speed_limits_on_traffic_equilibrium_and_system_performance_in_networks","257044480_Dynamic_user_equilibrium_with_a_path_based_cell_transmission_model_for_general_traffic_networks","251530791_Complementarity_formulations_for_the_cell_transmission_model_based_dynamic_user_equilibrium_with_departure_time_choice_elastic_demand_and_user_heterogeneity","249427774_The_impact_of_reducing_the_maximum_speed_limit_on_motorways_in_Switzerland_to_80km_h-1_on_emissions_and_peak_ozone","239438901_Optimal_Dynamic_Speed-Limit_Control_for_Highway_Work_Zone_Operations","228918495_Behavior_of_the_cell_transmission_model_and_effectiveness_of_ramp_metering","227427054_Stochastic_cell_transmission_model_SCTM_A_stochastic_dynamic_traffic_model_for_traffic_state_surveillance_and_assignment","224010978_Shock_Waves_on_the_Highway","224010934_On_Kinematic_Waves_II_A_Theory_of_Traffic_Flow_on_Long_Crowded_Roads","223565573_Doubly_uncertain_transportation_network_Degradable_capacity_and_stochastic_demand","223402552_Dynamic_Network_Traffic_Control","223050805_Evaluation_of_variable_speed_limits_to_improve_traffic_safety","222662864_01_06_abstrhtmlModel_Predictive_Control_for_Optimal_Coordination_of_Ramp_Metering_and_Variable_Speed_Control","222495278_Model-Based_Average_Reward_Reinforcement_Learning","222493482_The_cell_transmission_model_part_II_Network_traffic","222382044_A_cell-based_variational_inequality_of_the_dynamic_user_optimal_assignment_problem","222042957_A_robust_transportation_signal_control_problem_accounting_for_traffic_dynamics","220413063_Optimal_Motorway_Traffic_Flow_Control_Involving_Variable_Speed_Limits_and_Ramp_Metering","23527798_A_cell-based_simultaneous_route_and_departure_time_choice_model_with_elastic_demand","23527401_Daganzo_CF_The_cell_transmission_model_A_dynamic_representation_of_highway_traffic_consistent_with_the_hydrodynamic_theory_Transportation_Research_Part_B_Methodological_284_269-287","23526346_A_Novel_Traffic_Signal_Control_Formulation","11568187_Freeway_speed_limits_and_traffic_fatalities_in_Washington_State","2272122_On_Average_Versus_Discounted_Reward_Temporal--Difference_Learning"]}
