{"id":"337655529_On_L_infty_Stabilization_of_Diagonal_Semilinear_Hyperbolic_Systems_bySaturated_Boundary_Control","abstract":"This paper considers a diagonal semilinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations with positive and constant velocities coupled with a nonlinear source term. The boundary condition is composed of an unstable linear term and a saturated feedback control. Weak solutions with initial data in L2 ([0, 1]) are considered and well-posedness of the system is proven using nonlinear semigroup techniques. Local Lâˆž exponential stability is tackled by a Lyapunov analysis and convergence of semigroups. Moreover, an explicit estimation of the region of attraction is given.","authors":["Mathias Dus","Francesco Ferrante","Christophe Prieur"],"meta":["December 2019ESAIM Control Optimisation and Calculus of Variations 26","DOI:10.1051/cocv/2019069"],"references":["322671232_Stabilization_of_boundary_controlled_hyperbolic_PDEs_via_Lyapunov-based_event_triggered_sampling_and_quantization","330594025_Boundary_Control_Design_for_Linear_Conservation_Laws_in_the_Presence_of_Energy-Bounded_Measurement_Noise","322329108_Exponential_stability_of_general_1-D_quasilinear_systems_with_source_terms_for_the_C1_norm_under_boundary_conditions","316799413_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Linear_Systems_with_Saturating_Actuators","305636042_Quasi-Linear_Hyperbolic_Systems","305636040_Hyperbolic_Systems_of_Balance_Laws","304946183_Regularity_and_Lyapunov_Stabilization_of_Weak_Entropy_Solutions_to_Scalar_Conservation_Laws","291388721_Wave_Equation_With_Cone-Bounded_Control_Laws","279280926_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_for_One-Dimensional_Quasi-linear_Hyperbolic_Systems_Lyapunov_Stability_for_the_C1-Norm","255823858_Boundary_Control_of_PDEs_A_Course_on_Backstepping_Designs"]}
