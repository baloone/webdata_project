{"id":"263737708_Finding_relational_redescriptions","abstract":"We introduce relational redescription mining, that is, the task of finding two structurally different patterns that describe nearly the same set of object pairs in a relational dataset. By extending redescription mining beyond propositional and real-valued attributes, it provides a powerful tool to match different relational descriptions of the same concept.\nWe propose an alternating scheme for solving this problem. Its core consists of a novel relational query miner that efficiently identifies discriminative connection patterns between pairs of objects. Compared to a baseline Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approach, our query miner is able to mine more complex queries, much faster. We performed extensive experiments on three real world relational datasets, and present examples of redescriptions found, exhibiting the power of the method to expressively capture relations present in these networks.","authors":["Esther Galbrun","Angelika Kimmig"],"meta":["September 2014Machine Learning 96(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-013-5402-3"],"references":["273970737_Mining_the_Semantic_Web_-_Statistical_learning_for_next_generation_knowledge_bases","262245682_AMIE_Association_rule_mining_under_incomplete_evidence_in_ontological_knowledge_bases","257553431_Mining_the_Semantic_Web","226901825_RSD_Relational_Subgroup_Discovery_through_First-Order_Feature_Construction","221654447_Turning_CARTwheels_An_alternating_algorithm_for_mining_redescriptions","221653267_Mining_Tree_Queries_in_a_Graph","221605724_Toward_an_Architecture_for_Never-Ending_Language_Learning","221466796_DBpedia_A_Nucleus_for_a_Web_of_Open_Data","221309638_Schema_Mapping_as_Query_Discovery","221112174_Mode_Directed_Path_Finding","220773492_An_ILP_System_for_Learning_Head_Output_Connected_Predicates","220451976_Discovery_of_frequent_DATALOG_patterns","51960352_PARIS_Probabilistic_Alignment_of_Relations_Instances_and_Schema","30530729_A_Survey_of_Schema-Based_Matching_Approaches","2914632_Relational_Association_Rules_getting_WARMeR","1956867_Turning_CARTwheels_An_Alternating_Algorithm_for_Mining_Redescriptions","313665793_Inverse_entailment_and_Progol","310490008_From_black_and_white_to_full_color_extending_redescription_mining_outside_the_Boolean_world","278797384_A_Link-Based_Method_for_Propositionalization","269100282_Traps_and_pitfalls_when_learning_logical_definitions_from_relations","267422814_Ontological_Smoothing_for_Relation_Extraction_with_Minimal_Supervision","262391354_Block-wise_construction_of_acyclic_relational_features_with_monotone_irreducibility_and_relevancy_properties","225684795_An_algorithm_for_multi-relational_discovery_of_subgroups","221654228_Semi-supervised_feature_selection_for_graph_classification","221393183_Condensed_Representations_for_Inductive_Logic_Programming","221022804_YAGO_a_core_of_semantic_knowledge","221013143_Random_Walk_Inference_and_Learning_in_A_Large_Scale_Knowledge_Base","220907312_From_Black_and_White_to_Full_Colour_Extending_Redescription_Mining_Outside_the_Boolean_World","220907182_Finding_Subgroups_having_Several_Descriptions_Algorithms_for_Redescription_Mining","220699403_An_Algorithm_for_Multi-relational_Discovery_of_Subgroups","220546837_Itemset_mining_A_constraint_programming_perspective","220392375_Finding_association_rules_in_Semantic_Web_Data","220343614_Relational_Retrieval_Using_a_Combination_of_Path-Constrained_Random_Walks","4005993_gSpan_Graph-Based_Substructure_Pattern_Mining","2705623_Learning_Relations_by_Pathfinding","2425607_Inverse_entailment_and_Progol"]}
