{"id":"308077147_COMPREHENDING_THE_COMPLEXITY_OF_COUNTRIES_extension_and_update","abstract":"ABSTRACT\nThis article argues for a new kind of country study, now more than ever needed for international understanding. Like an ecosystem, or the human brain, each and every nation-state is a complex system of complex systems, an intricate network of elaborate networks, a unique composite of multiple dynamic subsystems and layers of connectivity. So the complexity or configuration of a country should be studied accordingly, that is to say, by scientists having an interest in it, willing to cooperate and using the latest in system analysis, computer science and informatics. In order to comprehend the complexity of a country, one-sidedness – no matter its disguise – should be avoided. The paper, first and foremost meant to be read (and fairly criticised) by scholars involved in the study of Asia, Africa or Latin America, addresses the controversies of long standing in all the social sciences about fundamental theoretical approaches. ‘Connect!’ is our advice to all those who are ready and willing to take the study of countries to a higher level.","authors":["Hans Kuijper"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":[]}
