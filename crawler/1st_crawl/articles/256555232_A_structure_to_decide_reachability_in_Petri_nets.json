{"id":"256555232_A_structure_to_decide_reachability_in_Petri_nets","abstract":"A new structure to analyse Petri nets and decide reachability is presented. Originated in Mary's regular constraint graphs with a consistent marking, it is simplified, cleared and made more flexible by the introduction of the new structure of precovering graph. With its help we prove new results for languages generated by a Petri net and initial and final markings constraints.","authors":["J.L.
