{"id":"354614587_Ethics_guidelines_for_trustworthy_AI","abstract":"The aim of the Guidelines is to promote Trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI has three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: (1) it should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations (2) it should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values and (3) it should be robust, both from a technical and social perspective since, even with good intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm. Each component in itself is necessary but not sufficient for the achievement of Trustworthy AI. Ideally, all three components work in harmony and overlap in their operation. If, in practice, tensions arise between these components, society should endeavour to align them.","authors":["George Sharkov","AI HLEG (European Commission)"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.2759/346720"],"references":[]}
