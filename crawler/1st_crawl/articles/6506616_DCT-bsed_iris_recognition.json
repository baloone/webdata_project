{"id":"6506616_DCT-bsed_iris_recognition","abstract":"This paper presents a novel iris coding method based on differences of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of overlapped angular patches from normalized iris images. The feature extraction capabilities of the DCT are optimized on the two largest publicly available iris image data sets, 2,156 images of 308 eyes from the CASIA database and 2,955 images of 150 eyes from the Bath database. On this data, we achieve 100 percent Correct Recognition Rate (CRR) and perfect Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves with no registered false accepts or rejects. Individual feature bit and patch position parameters are optimized for matching through a product-of-sum approach to Hamming distance calculation. For verification, a variable threshold is applied to the distance metric and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are recorded. A new worst-case metric is proposed for predicting practical system performance in the absence of matching failures, and the worst case theoretical Equal Error Rate (EER) is predicted to be as low as 2.59 x 10(-4) on the available data sets.","authors":["Donald M Monro","Soumyadip Rakshit","Dexin Zhang"],"meta":["May 2007IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 29(4):586-95","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1002","SourcePubMed"],"references":["228977909_Image_quality_assessment_for_iris_biometric","228770536_Multimodal_biometrics_An_overview","224737057_Fast_2-D_Discrete_cosine_transform","220660033_Face_Recognition_Using_the_Discrete_Cosine_Transform","3316773_A_Human_Identification_Technique_Using_Images_of_the_Iris_and_Wavelet_Transform","3308596_An_Introduction_to_Biometric_Recognition","2897844_Biometrics_A_Grand_Challenge","289628256_Image_sharpness_measurement_in_the_scanning_electron_microscope_-_Part_III","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition","242473075_Discrete_cosine_transform_Algorithms_advantages_applications","240060589_Introduction_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition-Second_Edition","239666326_Gross_anatomy_and_embryology_of_the_eye","238655612_Best_Practices_in_Testing_and_Reporting_Performance_of_Biometric_Devices","234014465_Digital_Image_Processing","232160025_The_Physiology_of_the_Eye","225304623_Inroduction_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","223661563_A_security_system_based_on_human_iris_identification_using_wavelet_transform","222670100_Daugman_J_The_Importance_of_being_Random_Statistical_Principles_of_Iris_Recognition_Pattern_Recognition_362_279-291","221356289_UBIRIS_A_noisy_iris_image_database","221017930_A_security_system_based_on_human_iris_identification_using_wavelet_transform","220659911_Statistical_Richness_of_Visual_Phase_Information_Update_on_Recognizing_Persons_by_Iris_Patterns","220460721_A_Comparison_of_Fast_Inverse_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_Algorithms","17635467_Iris_Mechanics_II_Influence_of_Pupil_Size_on_Details_of_Iris_Structure","12816030_Image_sharpness_measurement_in_scanning_electron_microscope-Part_III","12441253_A_'minimum-wear-and-tear'_meshwork_for_the_iris","11837977_Epigenetic_randomness_complexity_and_singularity_of_human_iris_patterns","8082262_Efficient_Iris_Recognition_by_Characterizing_Key_Local_Variations","4205882_Intrusion_detection_based_on_cross-correlation_of_system_call_sequences","4186552_An_effective_human_iris_code_with_low_complexity","4130197_Facial_identification_using_transformed_domain_by_SVM","4090664_An_iris_image_synthesis_method_based_on_PCA_and_super-resolution","3995792_An_efficient_iris_recognition_system","3421644_A_Real-Time_Focusing_Algorithm_for_Iris_Recognition_Camera","3318159_Integer_DCTs_and_fast_algorithms","3193635_Personal_Identification_Based_on_Iris_Texture_Analysis","3192736_Use_of_Fourier_and_Karhunen-Loeve_Decomposition_for_Fast_Pattern_Matching_With_a_Large_Set_of_Templates","3192194_High_confidence_visual_recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_statistical_independence","3046065_Discrete_Cosine_Transform","2985219_Iris_recognition_An_emerging_biometrie_technology"]}
