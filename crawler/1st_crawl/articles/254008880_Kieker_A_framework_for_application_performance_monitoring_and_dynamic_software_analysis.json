{"id":"254008880_Kieker_A_framework_for_application_performance_monitoring_and_dynamic_software_analysis","abstract":"Kieker is an extensible framework for monitoring and analyzing the runtime behavior of concurrent or distributed software systems. It provides measurement probes for application performance monitoring and control-flow tracing. Analysis plugins extract and visualize architectural models, augmented by quantitative observations. Configurable readers and writers allow Kieker to be used for online and offline analysis. This paper reviews the Kieker framework focusing on its features, its provided extension points for custom components, as well the imposed monitoring overhead.","authors":["Andr√© van Hoorn","Jan Waller","Wilhelm Hasselbring"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.1145/2188286.2188326","Conference: 3rd ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2012)"],"references":["242553111_Continuous_Monitoring_of_Software_Services_Design_and_Application_of_the_Kieker_Framework","221556395_Workload-intensity-sensitive_timing_behavior_analysis_for_distributed_multi-user_software_systems"]}
