{"id":"324772539_RANGER-DTL_20_Rigorous_Reconstruction_of_Gene-Family_Evolution_by_Duplication_Transfer_and_Loss","abstract":"RANGER-DTL 2.0 is a software program for inferring gene family evolution using Duplication-Transfer-Loss reconciliation. This new software is highly scalable and easy to use, and offers many new features not currently available in any other reconciliation program. RANGER-DTL 2.0 has a particular focus on reconciliation accuracy and can account for many sources of reconciliation uncertainty including uncertain gene tree rooting, gene tree topological uncertainty, multiple optimal reconciliations, and alternative event cost assignments. RANGER-DTL 2.0 is open-source and written in C ++ and Python.\n\nAvailability: \nPre-compiled executables, source code (open-source under GNU GPL), and a detailed manual are freely available from http://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/RANGER-DTL/.\n\nContact: \nmukul.bansal@uconn.edu.","authors":["Mukul S Bansal","Manolis Kellis","Misagh Kordi","Soumya Kundu"],"meta":["April 2018Bioinformatics 34(18)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty314"],"references":["326992547_On_the_impact_of_uncertain_gene_tree_rooting_on_duplication-transfer-loss_reconciliation","316077388_Toward_a_Metagenomic_Understanding_on_the_Bacterial_Composition_and_Resistome_in_Hong_Kong_Banknotes","314030514_Genomic_Data_Quality_Impacts_Automated_Detection_of_Lateral_Gene_Transfer_in_Fungi","283513031_The_Distant_Siblings-A_Phylogenomic_Roadmap_Illuminates_the_Origins_of_Extant_Diversity_in_Fungal_Aromatic_Polyketide_Biosynthesis","264939856_The_genome_of_Eimeria_falciformis_-_reduction_and_specialization_in_a_single_host_apicomplexan_parasite","311167998_Exact_Algorithms_for_Duplication-Transfer-Loss_Reconciliation_with_Non-Binary_Gene_Trees","295856189_EcceTERA_Comprehensive_gene_tree-species_tree_reconciliation_using_parsimony","284171600_HGTree_Database_of_horizontally_transferred_genes_determined_by_tree_reconciliation","279292489_Reconciliation_Approaches_to_Determining_HGT_Duplications_and_Losses_in_Gene_Trees","271589999_Phylogenetic_analysis_of_HpnP_reveals_the_origin_of_2-methylhopanoid_production_in_Alphaproteobacteria"]}
