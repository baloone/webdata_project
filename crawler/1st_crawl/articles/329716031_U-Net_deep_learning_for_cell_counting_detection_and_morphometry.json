{"id":"329716031_U-Net_deep_learning_for_cell_counting_detection_and_morphometry","abstract":"U-Net is a generic deep-learning solution for frequently occurring quantification tasks such as cell detection and shape measurements in biomedical image data. We present an ImageJ plugin that enables non-machine-learning experts to analyze their data with U-Net on either a local computer or a remote server/cloud service. The plugin comes with pretrained models for single-cell segmentation and allows for U-Net to be adapted to new tasks on the basis of a few annotated samples. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","authors":["Thorsten Falk","Dominic Mai","Robert Bensch","Özgün Çiçek"],"meta":["January 2019Nature Methods 16(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41592-018-0261-2","Project: Deep Learning for biomedical image analysis"],"references":["329192630_Content-aware_image_restoration_pushing_the_limits_of_fluorescence_microscopy","327347975_CDeep3M-Plug-and-Play_cloud-based_deep_learning_for_image_segmentation","320722620_An_Objective_Comparison_of_Cell_Tracking_Algorithms","319042973_Automated_Training_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Cell_Segmentation","304226155_3D_U-Net_Learning_Dense_Volumetric_Segmentation_from_Sparse_Annotation","323299396_Deep_learning_for_biology","315776891_Trainable_Weka_Segmentation_A_machine_learning_tool_for_microscopy_pixel_classification","313072707_3D_U-Net_Learning_Dense_Volumetric_Segmentation_from_Sparse_Annotation","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","303505510_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","276923248_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","260155433_A_benchmark_for_comparison_of_cell_tracking_algorithms","228085958_NIH_Image_to_ImageJ_25_years_of_image_analysis","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","288931576_Deep_learning"]}
