{"id":"331843099_Team-Based_Learning_A_Transformative_Use_of_Small_Groups_in_College_Teaching","abstract":"This book describes team-based learning (TBL), an unusually powerful and versatile teaching strategy that enables teachers to take small group learning to a whole new level of effectiveness. It is the only pedagogical use of small groups that is based on a recognition of the critical difference between \"groups\" and \"teams\", and intentionally employs specific procedures to transform newly-formed groups into high performance learning teams.\n\nThis book is a complete guide to implementing TBL in a way that will promote the deep learning all teachers strive for. This is a teaching strategy that promotes critical thinking, collaboration, mastery of discipline knowledge, and the ability to apply it.","authors":["Larry Michaelsen","Arletta Bauman Knight","L.
