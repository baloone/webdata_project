{"id":"261329673_Segmenting_dark_channel_prior_in_single_image_dehazing","abstract":"In image dehazing, the existing transmission estimators bring out the halo artefact at boundaries unless they adopt a refinement procedure with a high computational complexity. How the existing transmission estimation methods suffer from the halo artefact at the boundaries are analysed and it is found that the elaborate, high computational refinement procedure to remove the halo effect are excessive for dehazing. On the basis of the above-mentioned analysis and finding, a simple segmentation logic was embedded in an existing transmission estimator, which is sufficiently accurate for dehazing. The experiment verifies that the proposed method significantly reduces the halo artefact without requiring any refinement procedure.","authors":["T.M. Bui","Huy Tran","W. Kim","S.
