{"id":"328074628_Four_pitfalls_in_normalizing_citation_indicators_An_investigation_of_ESI's_selection_of_highly_cited_papers","abstract":"InCites Essential Science Indicators is becoming increasingly used to identify top-performing research and evaluate the impact of institutes. Unfortunately, our study shows that ESI indicators, as well as other normalized citation indicators, have the following flaws. First, the publication month and the online-to-print delay affect a paper's probability of becoming a Highly Cited Paper (HCP). Papers published in the earlier months of the year are more likely to accumulate enough citation counts to rank at the top 1% compared with those published in later months of the year. Papers with longer online-to-print delays have an apparent advantage for being selected as HCPs. Research field normalizations lead to the third pitfall. Different research fields have different citation thresholds for HCPs, making research field classification important for a journal. In addition, the uniform thresholds for both articles and reviews in ESI affect the reliability of HCP selection because, on average, reviews tend to have higher citation rates than articles. ESI's selection of HCPs provides an intuitive feel for the problems of normalized citation impact indicators, such as those provided in InCites and SciVal.","authors":["Zhigang hu","Wencan Tian","Shenmeng Xu","Chunbo Zhang"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Informetrics 12(4):1133-1145","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2018.09.006"],"references":[]}
