{"id":"337141421_On_the_Need_for_Data-Based_Model-Driven_Engineering","abstract":"In order to deal with the increasing complexity of modern systems such as in software-intensive environments, models are used in many research fields as abstract descriptions of reality. On the one side, a model serves as an abstraction for a specific purpose, as a kind of “blueprint” of a system, describing a system’s structure and desired behavior in the design phase. On the other side, there are so-called runtime models providing real abstractions of systems during runtime, for example, to monitor runtime behavior. Today, we recognize a discrepancy between the early snapshots and their real-world correspondents. To overcome this discrepancy, we propose to fully integrate models from the very beginning within the life cycle of a system. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a data-based model-driven engineering approach where we provide a unifying framework to combine downstream information from the model-driven engineering process with upstream information gathered during a system’s operation at runtime, by explicitly considering also a timing component. We present this temporal model framework step-by-step by selected use cases with increasing complexity.","authors":["Alexandra Mazak","Sabine Sint","Manuel Wimmer"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-25312-7_5","In book: Security and Quality in Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering (pp.103-127)"],"references":["333086120_Thirteen_years_of_SysML_a_systematic_mapping_study","324640550_A_survey_on_NoSQL_stores","323320895_A_Systematic_Review_of_Cloud_Modeling_Languages","322936038_Process_discovery_from_event_data_Relating_models_and_logs_through_abstractions","322697895_Guided_Process_Discovery_-_A_Pattern-based_Approach","320436662_Virtual_textual_model_composition_for_supporting_versioning_and_aspect-orientation","304163791_Mining_Local_Process_Models","303556052_Foundations_for_Streaming_Model_Transformations_by_Complex_Event_Processing","295870219_Handling_Big_Data_Research_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","286119666_A_Formalization_of_Complex_Event_Stream_Processing","282653659_Stream_my_Models_Reactive_Peer-to-Peer_Distributed_Modelsruntime","280046925_Map-Based_Transparent_Persistence_for_Very_Large_Models","280046702_Neo4EMF_A_scalable_persistence_layer_for_EMF_models","279258633_A_Native_Versioning_Concept_to_Support_Historized_Models_at_Runtime","275333036_MDEForge_An_extensible_Web-based_modeling_platform","273063103_Improving_Memory_Efficiency_for_Processing_Large-Scale_Models","271503941_Transforming_Very_Large_Models_in_the_Cloud_a_Research_Roadmap","269272409_Defining_architecture_components_of_the_Big_Data_Ecosystem","258243344_Processing_Flows_of_Information_From_Data_Stream_to_Complex_Event_Processing","233407171_Model-Driven_Software_Engineering_in_Practice","224601107_Models_runtime","221598068_Catching_Up_with_the_Data_Research_Issues_in_Mining_Data_Streams","221585990_Process_Mining_Manifesto","220920315_A_Meta_Model_for_Process_Mining_Data","220796090_Processing_flows_of_information_from_data_stream_to_complex_event_processing","328871303_Model-based_generation_of_run-time_data_collection_systems_exploiting_AutomationML","322708481_Execution-Based_Model_Profiling","322639440_On_the_Need_for_Temporal_Model_Repositories","322564331_Reverse_engineering_of_production_processes_based_on_Markov_chains","321117814_Predictive_Analytics_in_Information_Systems_Research","321053273_Sequence_Pattern_Mining_Automatisches_Erkennen_und_Auswerten_von_Interaktionsmustern_zwischen_technischen_Assets_basierend_auf_SysML-Sequenzdiagrammen_Paderborn_8_-10_November_2017","318138597_Towards_Automatic_Generation_of_Web-Based_Modeling_Editors","318138141_Towards_Stochastic_Performance_Models_for_Web_20_Applications","315953486_Model-Driven_Software_Engineering_in_Practice_Second_Edition","311609235_Towards_Liquid_Models_An_Evolutionary_Modeling_Approach","305903470_The_Six_Pillars_for_Building_Big_Data_Analytics_Ecosystems","305736330_Big_Data_From_Beginning_to_Future","304929258_3-D_Data_Management_Controlling_Data_Volume_Velocity_and_Variety","300379119_Reactive_stream_processing_for_data-centric_publishsubscribe","293816369_Streaming_Model_Transformations_Scenarios_Challenges_and_Initial_Solutions","283429662_Monitoring_of_business_processes_with_complex_event_processing","262235534_A_research_roadmap_towards_achieving_scalability_in_model_driven_engineering","262220303_Process_Mining","262163175_From_data_mining_to_knowledge_discovery_an_overview","261193352_Graph_partitioning_algorithm_for_model_transformation_frameworks","260015435_Querying_Large_Models_Efficiently","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","224513847_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Information_Science_and_Statistics","221555626_EMFStore_a_model_repository_for_EMF_models","221430238_Adaptable_Model_Versioning_in_Action","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","220451786_Frequent_pattern_mining_Current_status_and_future_directions","3297301_Workflow_Mining_Discovering_Process_Models_from_Event_Logs","220694592_The_power_of_events_-_an_introduction_to_complex_event_processing_in_distributed_enterprise_systems"]}
