{"id":"318823990_Gender_Classification_from_NIR_Iris_Images_Using_Deep_Learning","abstract":"Gender classification from NIR iris image is a new topic with only a few papers published. All previous work on gender-from-iris tried to find the best feature extraction techniques to represent the information of the iris texture for gender classification using normalized, encoded or periocular images. However this is a new topic in deep-learning application with soft biometric. In this chapter, we show that learning gender-iris representations through the use of deep neural networks may increase the performance obtained on these tasks. To this end, we propose the application of deep-learning methods to separate the gender-from-iris images even when the amount of learning data is limited, using an unsupervised stage with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and a supervised stage using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).","authors":["Juan Tapia Farias","Carlos Aravena"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-61657-5_9","In book: Deep Learning for Biometrics (pp.219-239)"],"references":["309758388_Iris_or_Periocular_Exploring_Sex_Prediction_from_Near_Infrared_Ocular_Images","308811515_Exploring_Gender_Prediction_from_Iris_Biometrics","303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","301973388_Gender_Classification_from_Iris_Images_Using_Fusion_of_Uniform_Local_Binary_Patterns","262401737_Gender_Classification_Using_One_Half_Face_and_Feature_Selection_Based_on_Mutual_Information","254321268_Gender_Classification_From_Face_Images_Using_Mutual_Information_and_Feature_Fusion","224396157_FRVT_2006_and_ICE_2006_large-scale_experimental_results","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221346269_Extracting_and_composing_robust_features_with_denoising_autoencoders","200744514_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","312288652_DeepGender_Occlusion_and_Low_Resolution_Robust_Facial_Gender_Classification_via_Progressively_Trained_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Attention","308299971_Age_and_gender_classification_using_convolutional_neural_networks","301240103_Gender_Classification_From_the_Same_Iris_Code_Used_for_Recognition","298719455_Brain_and_Visual_Perception_The_Story_of_a_25-year_Collaboration","261298470_SVM_Based_Gender_Classification_Using_Iris_Images","261165805_BSIF_Binarized_statistical_image_features","261152016_Predicting_Ethnicity_and_Gender_from_Iris_Texture","260299645_Gender_Classification_Based_on_Fusion_of_Different_Spatial_Scale_Features_Selected_by_Mutual_Information_From_Histogram_of_LBP_Intensity_and_Shape","255405296_Iris_Recognition_at_Airports_and_Border-Crossings","243782394_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code","222429241_Image_Understanding_for_Iris_Biometrics_A_Survey","220646776_Gender_recognition_A_multiscale_decision_fusion_approach","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition","215992186_Supporting_Online_Material_for_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","15829465_Neocognitron_A_self-organizing_neural_network_model_for_a_mechanism_of_pattern_recognition_unaffected_by_shift_in_position","7641976_Feature_Selection_Based_On_Mutual_Information_Criteria_of_Max-DependencyMax-Relevance_and_Min-Redundancy","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","5657016_Evaluation_of_Gender_Classification_Methods_with_Automatically_Detected_and_Aligned_Faces","4298116_Learning_to_predict_gender_from_iris_images","3886305_Gender_classification_using_support_vector_machines","3308604_How_Iris_Recognition_Works"]}
