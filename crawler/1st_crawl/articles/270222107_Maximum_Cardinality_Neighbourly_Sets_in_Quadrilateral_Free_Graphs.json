{"id":"270222107_Maximum_Cardinality_Neighbourly_Sets_in_Quadrilateral_Free_Graphs","abstract":"Neighbourly set of a graph is a subset of edges which either share an end\npoint or are joined by an edge of that graph. The maximum cardinality\nneighbourly set problem is known to be NP-complete for general graphs. Mahdian\n(M.Mahdian, On the computational complexity of strong edge coloring, Discrete\nApplied Mathematics, 118:239-248, 2002) proved that it is in polynomial time\nfor quadrilateral-free graphs and proposed an O(n^{11}) algorithm for the same\n(along with a note that by a straightforward but lengthy argument it can be\nproved to be solvable in O(n^5) running time). In this paper we propose an\nO(n^2) time algorithm for finding a maximum cardinality neighbourly set in a\nquadrilateral-free graph.","authors":["Neethi K.
