{"id":"338785431_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solutions_for_quaternion-valued_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","abstract":"Abstract In this paper, we are concerned with a class of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks with time-varying transmission delays and leakage delays. By applying a continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory and the Wirtinger inequality as well as constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence and global exponential stability of anti-periodic solutions via direct approaches. Our results are completely new. Finally, numerical examples are also provided to show the effectiveness of our results.","authors":["Yongkun Li","Jianglian Xiang"],"meta":["January 2020Advances in Difference Equations 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-020-2523-4"],"references":["335374562_Pseudo_almost_automorphic_solutions_of_quaternion-valued_neural_networks_with_infinitely_distributed_delays_via_a_non-decomposing_method","331146200_Periodic_solutions_for_quaternion-valued_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","328337474_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solutions_for_delayed_quaternion-valued_cellular_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","325511631_Anti-periodic_Solutions_for_Quaternion-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays","322082374_Existence_and_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_Neutral_Type_Quaternion-Valued_Neural_Networks_with_Delays_in_the_Leakage_Term_on_Time_Scales","337136369_Anti-periodic_solutions_for_generalized_inertial_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_distributed_delays","335259279_Almost_automorphic_synchronization_of_quaternion-valued_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_time-varying_and_distributed_delays","332999529_Existence_and_Exponential_Stability_of_Anti-Periodic_Solutions_for_Inertial_Quaternion-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_With_State-Dependent_Delays","330032108_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solution_for_Clifford-valued_inertial_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_delays","323632897_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_periodic_solutions_for_quaternion-valued_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays"]}
