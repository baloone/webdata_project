{"id":"220067760_The_Plane_with_Parallel_Coordinates","abstract":"By means ofParallel Coordinates planar “graphs” of multivariate relations are obtained. Certain properties of the relationship correspond tothe geometrical properties of its graph. On the plane a point ←→ line duality with several interesting properties is induced. A new duality betweenbounded and unbounded convex sets and hstars (a generalization of hyperbolas) and between Convex Unions and Intersections is found. This motivates some efficient Convexity algorithms and other results\ninComputational Geometry. There is also a suprising “cusp” ←→ “inflection point” duality. The narrative ends with a preview of the corresponding results inR\n\nN\n.","authors":["Alfred Inselberg"],"meta":["August 1985The Visual Computer 1(2):69-91","DOI:10.1007/BF01898350","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2993873_Digital_Reconstruction_of_Multidimensional_Signal_from_Their_Projection","346474783_Projective_Geometry","346368826_Convex_Analysis","312418683_Geometry_and_the_Imagination","274635950_Geometry_and_Imagination","271682700_The_Ordering_of_Multivariate_Data","270237266_Interpreting_Multivariate_Data","268939090_Advanced_Calculus","268920676_A_first_course_in_nomography","265367413_Projective_geometry_2nd_ed","238303163_Projective_Geometry_and_Projective_Metrics","235198551_The_Digital_Reconstruction_of_Multidimensional_Signals_from_Their_Projections","220617098_A_Hidden-Line_Algorithm_for_Hyperspace","220431955_Convexity_algorithms_in_parallel_coordinates","220110421_Divide_and_Conquer_for_Linear_Expected_Time","44367346_Interpreting_multivariate_data_edited_by_Vic_Barnett"]}
