{"id":"221591170_Public-key_Cryptosystems_from_the_Worst-case_Shortest_Vector_Problem","abstract":"We construct public-key cryptosystems that are secure assuming theworst-case hardness of approximating the minimum distance on n-dimensional lattices to within small Poly(n) factors. Prior cryptosystems with worst-case connections were based either on the shortest vector problem for a special class of lattices (Ajtai and Dwork, STOC 1997; Regev, J. ACM 2004), or on the conjectured hardness of lattice problems for quantum algorithms (Regev, STOC 2005). Our main technical innovation is a reduction from variants of the shortest vector problem to corresponding versions of the \"learning with errors\" (LWE) problem; previously, only a quantum reduction of this kind was known. As an additional contribution, we construct a natural chosen ciphertext-secure cryptosystem having a much simpler description and tighter underlying worst-case approximation factor than prior schemes.","authors":["Chris Peikert"],"meta":["January 2009Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/1536414.1536461","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC 2009, Bethesda, MD, USA, May 31 - June 2, 2009"],"references":["225334575_Public-Key_Cryptosystems_from_Lattice_Reduction_Problems","221591794_A_Hard-Core_Predicate_for_all_One-Way_Functions","221010567_Multi-bit_Cryptosystems_Based_on_Lattice_Problems","220138455_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","50863306_Factoring_Polynomials_with_Rational_Coefficients","3653458_Personal_view_of_average-case_complexity","308358823_Generating_shorter_bases_for_hard_random_lattices","266920710_Generating_hard_instance_of_lattice_problems","261124925_Cryptographic_Hardness_for_Learning_Intersections_of_Halfspaces","228588093_Circular-Secure_Encryption_from_Learning_Problems","226503368_Chosen-Ciphertext_Security_via_Correlated_Products","225507873_On_Lovasz'_lattice_reduction_and_the_nearest_lattice_point_problem","222439046_Probabilistic_Encryption","222303458_A_relation_of_primal-dual_lattices_and_the_complexity_of_shortest_lattice_vector_problem","222300538_On_the_Limits_of_Non-Approximability_of_Lattice_Problems","221591873_Trapdoors_for_hard_lattices_and_new_cryptographic_constructions","221591691_A_Public-Key_Cryptosystem_with_Worst-CaseAverage-Case_Equivalence","221591132_On_Lattices_Learning_with_Errors_Random_Linear_Codes_and_Cryptography","221355241_Statistical_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs_with_Efficient_Provers_Lattice_Problems_and_More","221354637_On_Bounded_Distance_Decoding_Unique_Shortest_Vectors_and_the_Minimum_Distance_Problem","221354194_Simultaneous_Hardcore_Bits_and_Cryptography_against_Memory_Attacks","221354032_Chosen-Ciphertext_Security_via_Correlated_Products","221348521_Predicting_Lattice_Reduction","220994657_On_Lovasz'_Lattice_Reduction_and_the_Nearest_Lattice_Point_Problem_Shortened_Version","220994283_Generating_Shorter_Bases_for_Hard_Random_Lattices","220898281_Generating_Hard_Instances_of_the_Short_Basis_Problem","220467840_Limits_on_the_Hardness_of_Lattice_Problems_in_l_p_Norms","220431624_On_lattices_learning_with_errors_random_linear_codes_and_cryptography","220336843_A_Framework_for_Efficient_and_Composable_Oblivious_Transfer","220333928_Lossy_Trapdoor_Functions_and_Their_Applications","220333300_Chosen-Ciphertext_Security_via_Correlated_Products","220138903_The_First_and_Fourth_Public-Key_Cryptosystems_with_Worst-CaseAverage-Case_Equivalence","220138343_A_Pubic-Key_Cryptosystem_with_Worst-CaseAverage-Case_Equivalence","220138142_Lossy_Trapdoor_Functions_and_Their_Applications","51991713_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","30816325_Public-Key_Cryptosystems_from_the_Worst-Case_Shortest_Vector_Problem","4257907_Limits_on_the_Hardness_of_Lattice_Problems_in_ell_p_Norms","4109355_Worst-Case_to_Average-Case_Reductions_Based_on_Gaussian_Measures","2713183_Generating_Hard_Instances_of_Lattice_Problems_Extended_Abstract","2566752_New_Lattice_Based_Cryptographic_Constructions","2489870_A_Sieve_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Lattice_Vector_Problem"]}
