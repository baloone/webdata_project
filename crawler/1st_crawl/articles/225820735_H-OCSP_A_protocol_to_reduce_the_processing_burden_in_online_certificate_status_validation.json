{"id":"225820735_H-OCSP_A_protocol_to_reduce_the_processing_burden_in_online_certificate_status_validation","abstract":"Public-key cryptography is widely used as the underlying mechanism for securing many protocols and applications in the Internet.\nA Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is required to securely deliver public-keys to widely-distributed users or systems. The\npublic key is usually made public by means of a digital document called certificate. Certificates are valid during a certain\nperiod of time; however, there are circumstances under which the validity of a certificate must be terminated sooner than\nassigned and thus, the certificate needs to be revoked. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is one of the most used\nprotocols for retrieving certificate status information from the PKI. However, the OCSP protocol requires online signatures,\nwhich is a costly operation. In this article, we present an improvement over OCSP based on hash chains that reduces the processing\nburden in the server which in turn provides an additional protection against attacks based on flooding of queries.","authors":["Jose L.
