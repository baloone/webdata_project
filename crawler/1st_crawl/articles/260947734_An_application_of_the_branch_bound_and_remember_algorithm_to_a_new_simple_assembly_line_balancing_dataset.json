{"id":"260947734_An_application_of_the_branch_bound_and_remember_algorithm_to_a_new_simple_assembly_line_balancing_dataset","abstract":"The simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP) is a well-studied NP-complete problem for which a new problem database of generated instances was published in 2013. This paper describes the application of a branch, bound, and remember (BB&R) algorithm using the cyclic best-first search strategy to this new database to produce provably exact solutions for 86% of the unsolved problems in this database. A new backtracking rule to save memory is employed to allow the BB&R algorithm to solve many of the largest problems in the database.","authors":["David R. Morrison","Edward C.
