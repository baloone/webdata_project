{"id":"295248405_Dual_parameterization_and_parameterized_approximability_of_subset_graph_problems","abstract":"We discuss approximability in FPT-time for the class of \\emph{subset optimization graph problems} where a feasible solution~$S$ is a subset of the vertex set of the input graph. This class encompasses many well-known problems, such as \\DS, \\VC, \\is, \\fvs. We study approximability of such problems with respect to the dual parameter $n-k$ where~$n$ is size of the vertex set and~$k$ the standard parameter. We show that under such parameterization, many of these problems, while \\textbf{W[$\\mathbf{\\cdot}$]}-hard, admit parameterized approximation schemata.","authors":["Ã‰douard Bonnet","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["February 2016RAIRO - Operations Research 51(1)","DOI:10.1051/ro/2016018"],"references":["256981661_Playing_with_parameters_structural_parameterization_in_graphs","228346239_Parameterized_algorithmics_A_graph-theoretic_approach","226785142_On_Parameterized_Approximability","225437095_Parameterized_Approximation_Problems","220060497_On_dependent_randomized_rounding_algorithms","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650319_Complexity_and_Approximation","221369179_Exact_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_A_Survey","220980428_Improved_Tree_Decomposition_Based_Algorithms_for_Domination-like_Problems","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","2575467_Compendium_of_Parameterized_Problems"]}
