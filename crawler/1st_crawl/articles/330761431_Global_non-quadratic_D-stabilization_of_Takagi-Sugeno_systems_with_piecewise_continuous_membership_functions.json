{"id":"330761431_Global_non-quadratic_D-stabilization_of_Takagi-Sugeno_systems_with_piecewise_continuous_membership_functions","abstract":"his paper deals with the non-quadratic stabilization of Takagiâ€“Sugeno (T-S) models with -stability constraints. Based on a recently proposed Non-Quadratic Lyapunov Function (NQLF), which involves the mean values of the membership functions (MFs) over a given time interval, three theorems are proposed for the design of non-Parallel Distributed Compensation (non-PDC) controllers satisfying closed-loop D-stability specifications. Despite previous non-quadratic approaches and thanks to the nature of the considered NQLF, it is highlighted that the proposed LMI-based procedures not only apply for the global non-quadratic D-stabilization of T-S models, but also for a larger class of T-S models with piecewise membership functions (i.e. a class of switching nonlinear systems), since no requirement is needed regarding to the bounds of the MFs derivatives. The effectiveness of the proposed LMI-based conditions and their relative degrees of conservatism, compared with previous quadratic D-stabilization results, are illustrated through an academic example involving piecewise membership functions.","authors":["Abdelmadjid Cherifi","Kevin Guelton","Laurent Arcese","Valter J.
