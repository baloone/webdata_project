{"id":"325125984_Duo_of_Digital_and_Material_Artefacts_Dedicated_to_the_Learning_of_Geometry_at_Primary_School","abstract":"Our research project questions the bonus brought by technology and the complementarities of material and digital frameworks in situations which link together digital tools and material tools. We will present here some features to define a duo of digital and material artefacts. We will illustrate our point with a situation to stimulate the use of a pair of compasses as a tool to construct a triangle with given lengths of the sides. We will show that digital technology can bring a didactic bonus, an extra value to a material tool for learning. Digital technology can raise functionalities which refer to a material tool, and vice versa, the material tool can enrich the digital tool. We will show how a duo of artefacts, both material and digital, used in a situation, brings processes of assimilation and adaptation of utilization schemes from one instrument to the other which assist in their instrumental geneses and lead to conceptualisation.","authors":["Anne Voltolini"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-76575-4_5","In book: Uses of Technology in Primary and Secondary Mathematics Education (pp.83-99)"],"references":["239527067_The_interaction_between_task_design_and_technology_design_in_creating_tasks_with_Cabri_Elem","285085993_Les_conditions_cognitives_de_l'apprentissage_de_la_geometrie_Developpement_de_la_visualisation_differenciation_des_raisonnements_et_coordination_de_leurs_fonctionnements","277923351_Articulation_of_spatial_and_geometrical_knowledge_in_problem_solving_with_technology_at_primary_school","260390704_A_Study_Comparing_Virtual_Manipulatives_with_Other_Instructional_Treatments_in_Third-_and_Fourth-Grade_Classrooms","258845851_Designing_a_duo_of_material_and_digital_artifacts_The_pascaline_and_Cabri_Elem_e-books_in_primary_school_mathematics","248072272_Theory_of_Didactical_Situations_in_Mathematics","246677993_Les_Hommes_et_les_Technologies_Approche_Cognitive_des_Instruments_Contemporains","238331902_The_Theory_of_Conceptual_Fields","226396176_Managing_the_Complexity_of_HumanMachine_Interactions_in_Computerized_Learning_Environments_Guiding_Command_Process_Through_Orchestrations"]}
