{"id":"309514546_Approximate_results_for_rainbow_labelings","abstract":"A simple graph (Formula presented.) is said to be antimagic if there exists a bijection (Formula presented.) such that the sum of the values of f on edges incident to a vertex takes different values on distinct vertices. The graph G is distance antimagic if there exists a bijection (Formula presented.) such that (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)Using the polynomial method of Alon we prove that there are antimagic injections of any graph G with n vertices and m edges in the interval (Formula presented.) and, for trees with k inner vertices, in the interval (Formula presented.) In particular, a tree all of whose inner vertices are adjacent to a leaf is antimagic. This gives a partial positive answer to a conjecture by Hartsfield and Ringel. We also show that there are distance antimagic injections of a graph G with order n and maximum degree (Formula presented.) in the interval (Formula presented.) where (Formula presented.) and, for trees with k leaves, in the interval (Formula presented.) In particular, all trees with (Formula presented.) vertices and no pairs of leaves sharing their neighbour are distance antimagic, a partial solution to a conjecture of Arumugam.","authors":["Anna Llad√≥","Mirka Miller"],"meta":["October 2016Periodica Mathematica Hungarica 74(1):1-11","DOI:10.1007/s10998-016-0151-2"],"references":["262836610_Super_Edge-Antimagic_Graphs_A_Wealth_of_Problems_and_Some_Solutions","227763356_Regular_Bipartite_Graphs_Are_Antimagic","221427243_Toroidal_Grids_Are_Anti-magic","220549101_Anti-magic_graphs_via_the_Combinatorial_NullStellenSatz","220184812_On_anti-magic_labeling_for_graph_products","45916297_Partitions_of_nonzero_elements_of_a_finite_field_into_pairs","2827653_A_Dynamic_Survey_of_Graph_Labeling","231992373_Combinatorial_Nullstellensatz","225559286_Additive_Latin_transversals","220548614_Dense_graphs_are_antimagic","220297374_Integer_sets_with_prescribed_pairwise_differences_being_distinct","220266570_On_Antimagic_Labeling_for_Generalized_Web_and_Flower_Graphs","220192662_On_zero-sum_partitions_and_anti-magic_trees","220190376_Every_tree_is_a_large_subtree_of_a_tree_that_decomposes_Kn_or_Kn_n","220186075_A_new_class_of_antimagic_Cartesian_product_graphs","220152543_The_antimagicness_of_the_Cartesian_product_of_graphs","2126355_Lattice_Grids_and_Prisms_are_Antimagic"]}
