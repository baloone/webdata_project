{"id":"345646387_Using_a_Revised_Knowledge_Pyramid_to_Redefine_Knowledge_Management_Strategy","abstract":"The knowledge pyramid has been used for several years to illustrate the hierarchical relationships between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. This chapter posits that the knowledge pyramid is too basic and fails to represent reality and presents a revised knowledge-KM pyramid. One key difference is that the revised knowledge-KM pyramid includes knowledge management as an extraction of reality with a focus on organizational learning. The revised pyramid includes newer initiatives such as business and/or customer intelligence, big data, analytics, internet of things. Finally, this chapter discusses how KM strategy can be generated using the final revised pyramid.","authors":["Murray E.
