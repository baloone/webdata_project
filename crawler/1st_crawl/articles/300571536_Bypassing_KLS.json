{"id":"300571536_Bypassing_KLS","abstract":"We present an O*(n³) randomized algorithm for estimating the volume of a well-rounded convex body given by a membership oracle, improving on the previous best complexity of O*(n⁴). The new algorithmic ingredient is an accelerated cooling schedule where the rate of cooling increases with the temperature. Previously, the known approach for potentially achieving such complexity relied on a positive resolution of the KLS hyperplane conjecture, a central open problem in convex geometry.","authors":["Benjamin Cousins","Santosh Vempala"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2746539.2746563","Conference: the Forty-Seventh Annual ACM"],"references":["227319639_Isoperimetric_problems_for_convex_bodies_and_a_localization_lemma","221668710_Thin_Shell_Implies_Spectral_Gap_Up_to_Polylog_via_a_Stochastic_Localization_Scheme","221591212_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","45893743_Approximately_Gaussian_marginals_and_the_hyperplane_conjecture","2268775_Computing_The_Volume_Of_Convex_Bodies_A_Case_Where_Randomness_Provably_Helps","346088083_Random_walks_and_an_On5_volume_algorithm_for_convex_bodies","255671986_Random_Walks_And_An_On_Volume_Algorithm_For_Convex_Bodies","248825285_A_random_polynomial_time_algorithm_for_estimating_volumes_of_convex_bodies","246716582_Logarithmically_concave_functions_and_sections_of_convex_sets_in_R","243063750_Approximation_of_the_Sphere_by_Polytopes_having_Few_Vertices","243024054_Concentration_in_a_thin_Euclidean_shell_for_log-concave_measures","241689162_A_Cubic_Algorithm_for_Computing_Gaussian_Volume","222823460_Simulated_annealing_in_convex_bodies_and_an_On4_volume_algorithm","221591053_Computing_the_Volume_Is_Difficult","221590520_Sampling_and_Integration_of_Near_Log-Concave_functions","221499060_The_Mixing_Rate_of_Markov_Chains_an_Isoperimetric_Inequality_and_Computing_the_Volume","221499039_Fast_Algorithms_for_Logconcave_Functions_Sampling_Rounding_Integration_and_Optimization","220617483_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","220617231_On_the_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Volume_of_a_Polyhedron","220345815_The_weight_of_the_shortest_path_tree","220345811_Random_Walks_in_a_Convex_Body_and_an_Improved_Volume_Algorithm","220345718_An_elementary_procedure_for_sampling_points_in_a_convex_body","220345159_The_geometry_of_logconcave_functions_and_sampling_algorithms","2505506_A_Random_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_For_Approximating_The_Volume_Of_Convex_Bodies"]}
