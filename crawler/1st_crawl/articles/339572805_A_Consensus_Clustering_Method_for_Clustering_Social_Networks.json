{"id":"339572805_A_Consensus_Clustering_Method_for_Clustering_Social_Networks","abstract":"Detecting Communities in networks is one of the appealing fields in computer science. A wide range of methods are proposed for this problem. These methods employ different strategies and optimization functions to detect communities (or clusters). Therefore, it seems a good idea to combine these strategies to take advantage of the strengths of the methods and overcome their problems. This is the idea behind consensus clustering technique which combines several clustering results into one. In this paper, we propose a very good-performing method based on consensus clustering to detect communities of a network. Our method, called “Azar”, employed several community detection methods as base methods. Then Azar generates a new compressed network based on the common views of the used base methods and, gives this new compressed network to the last community detection method to find the final partition. We evaluate our approach by employing real and artificial datasets. The implementation results compare the base methods with Azar according to accuracy measures such as modularity and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The results show the good-performing behavior of Azar even for the most difficult networks. The results show the brilliant power of Azar in comparison with all the other methods.","authors":["Masoumeh Kheirkhahzadeh","Morteza Analoui"],"meta":["February 2020Statistics Optimization & Information Computing 8(1):254-271","DOI:10.19139/soic-2310-5070-716"],"references":["337710054_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks_Using_Consensus_Clustering","321448608_Anomaly_Detection_in_Big_Data_based_on_Clustering","320279995_Multiresolution_Consensus_Clustering_in_Networks","318227504_Ensemble-based_Community_Detection_in_Multilayer_Networks","303367001_Analysis_of_Network_Clustering_Algorithms_and_Cluster_Quality_Metrics_at_Scale","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","307735112_Two-Step_Semidefinite_Programming_approach_to_clustering_and_dimensionality_reduction","305780197_Community_detection_in_networks_A_user_guide","301876570_Metrics_for_Community_Analysis_A_Survey","283738615_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection","280320073_Ensemble_Selection_for_Community_Detection_in_Complex_Networks","264124767_Community_detection_in_large-scale_networks_A_survey_and_empirical_evaluation","283531736_Efficient_community_detection_of_network_flows_for_varying_Markov_times_and_bipartite_networks","281675121_A_Survey_on_Community_Detection_Methods_in_Social_Networks","267480859_An_ensemble_learning_strategy_for_graph_clustering"]}
