{"id":"221618660_Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty","abstract":"This paper investigates a new learning model in which the input data is corrupted with noise. We present a general statistical framework to tackle this problem. Based on the statistical reasoning, we propose a novel formulation of support vector classification, which allows uncer- tainty in input data. We derive an intuitive geometric interpretation of the proposed formulation, and develop algorithms to efficiently solve it. Empirical results are included to show that the newly formed method is superior to the standard SVM for problems with noisy input.","authors":["Jinbo Bi","Tong Zhang"],"meta":["January 2004","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 17 [Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS 2004, December 13-18, 2004, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]"],"references":["262318598_Convergence_of_alternating_optimization","285754756_Tikhonov_regularization_and_total_least_squares","243767534_The_Total_Least_Squares_Problem_Computational_Aspects_and_Analysis","243095725_An_Analysis_of_the_Total_Least_Squares_Problem","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","221497736_Learning_with_Rigorous_Support_Vector_Machines","2500247_Robust_Solutions_To_Least-Squares_Problems_With_Uncertain_Data"]}
