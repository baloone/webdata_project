{"id":"319952862_Higher_Order_Concentration_of_Measure","abstract":"We study sharpened forms of the concentration of measure phenomenon typically centered at stochastic expansions of order $d-1$ for any $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The bounds are based on $d$-th order derivatives or difference operators. In particular, we consider deviations of functions of independent random variables and differentiable functions over probability measures satisfying a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and functions on the unit sphere. Applications include concentration inequalities for $U$-statistics as well as for classes of symmetric functions via polynomial approximations on the sphere (Edgeworth-type expansions).","authors":["Sergey Bobkov","Friedrich Goetze","Holger Sambale"],"meta":["September 2017Communications in Contemporary Mathematics 21(3)","DOI:10.1142/S0219199718500438"],"references":["272684347_Asymptotic_Analysis_of_Symmetric_Functions","272422981_Second_order_concentration_on_the_sphere","267131340_Estimation_of_multiple_random_integrals_and_U-statistics","344485423_Concentration_Inequalities_A_Nonasymptotic_Theory_of_Independence","329978375_Estimation_of_Multiple_Random_Integrals_and_U-Statistics","313572058_Variations_on_the_Berry_-_Esseen_theorem","279341620_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Inequalities","275218433_Robust_estimation_of_U-statistics","268248215_Moment_Estimates_Derived_from_Poincare_and_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Inequalities","268009097_On_Some_Gaussian_Concentration_Inequality_for_Non-Lipschitz_Functions"]}
