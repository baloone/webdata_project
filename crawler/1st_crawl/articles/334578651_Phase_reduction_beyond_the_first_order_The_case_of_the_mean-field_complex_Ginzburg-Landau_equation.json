{"id":"334578651_Phase_reduction_beyond_the_first_order_The_case_of_the_mean-field_complex_Ginzburg-Landau_equation","abstract":"Phase reduction is a powerful technique that makes possible to describe the dynamics of a weakly perturbed limit-cycle oscillator in terms of its phase. For ensembles of oscillators, a classical example of phase reduction is the derivation of the Kuramoto model from the mean-field complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (MF-CGLE). Still, the Kuramoto model is a first-order phase approximation that displays either full synchronization or incoherence, but none of the nontrivial dynamics of the MF-CGLE. This fact calls for an expansion beyond the first order in the coupling constant. We develop an isochron-based scheme to obtain the second-order phase approximation, which reproduces the weak-coupling dynamics of the MF-CGLE. The practicality of our method is evidenced by extending the calculation up to third order. Each new term of the power-series expansion contributes with additional higher-order multibody (i.e., nonpairwise) interactions. This points to intricate multibody phase interactions as the source of pure collective chaos in the MF-CGLE at moderate coupling.","authors":["Iván León","Diego Pazó"],"meta":["July 2019PHYSICAL REVIEW E 100(1)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.100.012211","Project: Variability and reliability in high-dimensional chaotic systems"],"references":["328470508_Dynamics_of_a_large_system_of_spiking_neurons_with_synaptic_delay","327568013_Phase_reduction_and_phase-based_optimal_control_for_biological_systems_a_tutorial","323217524_Chaos_in_Kuramoto_Oscillator_Networks","308386647_A_minimal_model_of_self-consistent_partial_synchrony","283705954_Phase_reduction_approach_to_synchronisation_of_nonlinear_oscillators","282403381_Experimental_Study_of_Synchronization_of_Coupled_Electrical_Self-Oscillators_and_Comparison_to_the_Sakaguchi-Kuramoto_model","275588348_Dynamics_of_globally_coupled_oscillators_Progress_and_perspectives","261915148_Chimera_States_The_Existence_Criteria_Revisited","260250563_Reconstructing_Effective_Phase_Connectivity_of_Oscillator_Networks_from_Observations","259804489_Clustering_in_Globally_Coupled_Oscillators_Near_a_Hopf_Bifurcation_Theory_and_Experiments","243549127_Collective_Chaos_in_a_Population_of_Globally_Coupled_Oscillators","232714141_Experiments_on_oscillator_ensembles_with_global_nonlinear_coupling","226094142_Isochrons_and_phaseless_sets","222648127_Bifurcation_to_heteroclinic_cycles_and_sensitivity_in_three_and_four_coupled_phase_oscillators","221745557_Chaos_in_Symmetric_Phase_Oscillator_Networks","51939692_The_Kuramoto_model_with_distributed_shear","51899747_Collective_synchronization_in_the_presence_of_reactive_coupling_and_shear_diversity","344486673_Synchronization_A_Universal_Concept_in_Nonlinear_Sciences","333883865_Abrupt_Desynchronization_and_Extensive_Multistability_in_Globally_Coupled_Oscillator_Simplexes","333597843_Between_phase_and_amplitude_oscillators","331607275_Exotic_states_in_a_simple_network_of_nanoelectromechanical_oscillators","330921264_Cluster_singularity_The_unfolding_of_clustering_behavior_in_globally_coupled_Stuart-Landau_oscillators","330487263_Numerical_phase_reduction_beyond_the_first_order_approximation","323747064_Symmetries_of_Chimera_States","321512671_Applied_Mathematical_Sciences","314433353_Heteroclinic_switching_between_chimeras","313392433_Self-entralnment_of_a_population_of_coupled_non-linear_oscillators","303682016_Chaos_in_generically_coupled_phase_oscillator_networks_with_nonpairwise_interactions","303330118_From_Quasiperiodic_Partial_Synchronization_to_Collective_Chaos_in_Populations_of_Inhibitory_Neurons_with_Delay","301232983_The_Geometry_of_Biological_Time","288684650_Dynamical_transitions_in_large_systems_of_mean_field-coupled_Landau-Stuart_oscillators_Extensive_chaos_and_cluster_states","281576116_Phase-lag_synchronization_in_networks_of_coupled_chemical_oscillators","281056078_Two_types_of_quasiperiodic_partial_synchrony_in_oscillator_ensembles","280590069_Hopf_normal_form_with_S_N_symmetry_and_reduction_to_systems_of_nonlinearly_coupled_phase_oscillators","260973105_Phase-_and_Center-Manifold_Reductions_for_Large_Populations_of_Coupled_Oscillators_with_Application_to_Non-Locally_Coupled_Systems","260573923_Replicating_Spots_in_Reaction-Diffusion_Systems","259302235_Sync_The_Emerging_Science_of_Spontaneous_Order","247845143_The_dynamics_of_N_weakly_coupled_identical_oscillators","247605785_Spatio-Temporal_Pattern_Formation","243257337_Towards_a_quasi-periodic_mean_field_theory_for_globally_coupled_oscillators","243243837_Anomalous_Lyapunov_spectrum_in_globally_coupled_oscillators","243243724_From_collective_oscillations_to_collective_chaos_in_a_globally_coupled_oscillator_system","234540704_A_Soluble_Active_Rotater_Model_Showing_Phase_Transitions_via_Mutual_Entertainment","232952550_Clustering_in_globally_coupled_oscillators","229556974_Collective_Lyapunov_modes","225337368_Patterns_of_phase_compromise_in_biological_cycles","224043867_Chemical_Oscillations_Waves_and_Turbulence_New_York_Springer-Verlag","223821554_Collective_chaos_and_noise_in_the_globally_coupled_complex_Ginzburg-Landau_equation","223171977_Onset_of_cooperative_entrainment_in_limit-cycle_oscillators_with_uniform_all-to-all_interactions_Bifurcation_of_the_order_function","222406841_Phase_compactons","51503574_Shear_Diversity_Prevents_Collective_Synchronization","51460155_Reconstructing_phase_dynamics_of_oscillator_networks","51247332_Multistable_Attractors_in_a_Network_of_Phase_Oscillators_with_Three-Body_Interactions","51152990_Synchronization_and_stimulated_emission_in_an_array_of_mechanical_phase_oscillators_on_a_resonant_support","45915542_Individual_and_Collective_Behavior_of_Small_Vibrating_Motors_Interacting_Through_a_Resonant_Plate"]}
