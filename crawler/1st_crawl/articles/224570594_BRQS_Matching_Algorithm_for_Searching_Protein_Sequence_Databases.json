{"id":"224570594_BRQS_Matching_Algorithm_for_Searching_Protein_Sequence_Databases","abstract":"String matching algorithms play a key role in many computer science problems, challenges and in the implementation of computer software. This problem has received a great deal of attention due to various applications in computational biology. In our study, we propose a new algorithm called BRQS. Experimental results show that it offers fewer numbers of comparisons and offers improved elapsed searching time when compared to other well-known algorithms for searching any length of alphabets and patterns. The proposed algorithm is applicable to search protein sequence databases as well as any other string searching applications.","authors":["A.F.
