{"id":"332133389_Hermitian_Self-Dual_MDS_and_Generalized_Reed-Solomon_Codes","abstract":"Both self-dual codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes have nice algebraic structures, theoretical significant, and practical implications. We present two classes of Hermitian self-dual, MDS, and generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. Conversely, we prove that Hermitian self-dual, MDS, and GRS codes must be above two classes for n = 4 and conjecture that this result also holds for each even length n, 4≤n≤q+1.","authors":["Yongfeng Niu","Qin Yue","Yansheng Wu","Liqin Hu"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Communications Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2908640"],"references":["323514332_A_note_on_the_constructions_of_MDS_self-dual_codes","321804931_Some_quantum_MDS_codes_with_large_minimum_distance_from_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes","308740278_Quantum_MDS_codes_with_relatively_large_minimum_distance_from_Hermitian_self-orthogonal_codes","280589778_New_q-ary_Quantum_MDS_Codes_with_Distances_Bigger_than_fracq2","268689393_On_the_Classification_of_MDS_Codes","259764579_On_the_Existence_of_MDS_Codes_Over_Small_Fields_With_Constrained_Generator_Matrices","258442171_A_construction_of_new_quantum_MDS_codes","251375604_New_MDS_self-dual_codes_over_finite_fields","291229449_New_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_from_Generalized_Reed-Solomon_Codes","257481663_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_over_Large_Prime_Fields"]}
