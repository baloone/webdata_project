{"id":"297765004_Some_strong_convergence_results_of_random_iterative_algorithms_with_errors_in_banach_spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we study the strong convergence and stability of a new two step random iterative scheme with errors for accretive Lips-chitzian mapping in real Banach spaces. The new iterative scheme is more acceptable because of much better convergence rate and less restrictions on parameters as compared to random Ishikawa iterative scheme with errors. We support our analytic proofs by providing numerical exam-ples. Applications of random iterative schemes with errors to variational inequality are also given. Our results improve and establish random gen-eralization of results obtained by Chang [4], Zhang [31] and many others.","authors":["Renu Chugh","Vivek Kumar","Satish Narwal"],"meta":["January 2016Communications of the Korean Mathematical Society 31(1):147-161","DOI:10.4134/CKMS.2016.31.1.147"],"references":["265539502_A_Perturbed_Algorithm_for_Variational_Inclusions","265493607_Random_coincidence_points_of_subcompatible_multivalued_maps_with_applications","256762365_On_nonlinear_variational_inequalities","222780677_New_Approximation_Schemes_for_General_Variational_Inequalities","41448764_Random_Fixed_Points_and_Random_Approximations_in_Nonconvex_Domains","41448666_Convergence_of_an_iteration_leading_to_a_solution_of_a_random_operator_equation","27364096_On_random_coincidence_and_fixed_points_for_a_pair_of_multivalued_and_single-valued_mappings","27363522_Equivalence_and_stability_of_random_fixed_point_iterative_procedures","321513439_Geometry_of_Banach_Spaces_Duality_Mappings_and_Nonlinear_Problems","298879679_Existence_and_approximation_of_solutions_to_variational_inclusions_with_accretive_mappings_in_Banach_spaces","286102303_Convergence_of_random_SP_iterative_scheme","279347755_Geometry_of_Banach_Spaces_Duality_Mappings_and_Nonlinear_Problem","268869540_Random_fixed_points_and_random_approximations","266988021_On_measurable_relations","266423890_Iteration_to_obtain_random_solutions_and_fixed_points_of_operators_in_uniformly_convex_Banach_spaces","265269993_AN_ITERATION_LEADING_TO_RANDOM_SOLUTIONS_AND_FIXED_POINTS_OF_OPERATORS","262349514_Convergence_of_SP_iterative_scheme_with_mixed_errors_for_accretive_Lipschitzian_and_strongly_accretive_Lipschitzian_operators_in_Banach_space","258234753_Nonlinear_Semigroups_and_Evolution_Equations","246200848_Fixed_point_theorems_in_probabilistic_analysis","243011217_Iterative_Solution_of_Nonlinear_Equations_Involving_m-Accretive_Operators_in_Banach_Spaces","240106517_Mann_and_Ishikawa_Type_Perturbed_Iterative_Algorithms_for_Generalized_Quasivariational_Inclusions","239059405_Nonlinear_functional_analysis_and_its_applications_IIB","238856787_Iterative_Algorithms_for_Finding_Approximate_Solutions_for_General_Strongly_Nonlinear_Variational_Inequalities","233065433_Modified_Ishikawa_Iteration_Process_for_Nonlinear_Lipschitz_Generalized_Strongly_Pseudo-Contractive_Operators_in_Arbitrary_Banach_Spaces","232394757_On_Picard_iterations_for_strongly_accretive_and_strongly_pseudo-contractive_Lipschitz_mappings","232369468_Perturbed_Proximal_Point_Algorithms_for_Generalized_Quasivariational_Inclusions","229899168_Ishikawa_iterative_process_with_errors_for_nonlinear_equations_of_generalized_monotone_type_in_Banach_spaces","229169589_Generalized_Strongly_Nonlinear_Quasivariational_Inequalities","223118862_Random_Mann_iteration_scheme","222619444_The_Mann_and_Ishikawa_iterative_approximation_of_solutions_to_variational_inclusions_with_accretive_type_mappings","222483492_General_strongly_nonlinear_variational_inequalities","222385264_Iterative_procedures_for_solutions_of_random_operator_equations_in_Banach_spaces","27187083_Ishikawa_iterative_process_for_strongly_pseudocontractive_operators_in_arbitrary_Banach_spaces"]}
