{"id":"308457886_Model_Checking_and_Validity_in_Propositional_and_Modal_Inclusion_Logics","abstract":"Modal inclusion logic is a formalism that belongs to the family of logics based on team semantics. This article investigates the model checking and validity problems of propositional and modal inclusion logics. We identify complexity bounds for both problems, covering both lax and strict team semantics. Thereby we tie some loose ends related to the programme that ultimately aims to classify the complexities of the basic reasoning problems for modal and propositional dependence, independence, and inclusion logics.","authors":["Lauri Hella","Antti Kuusisto","Arne Meier","Jonni Virtema"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Logic and Computation 29(5)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exz008"],"references":["308962471_Propositional_Team_Logics","344486660_Modal_Logic","316795215_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","312662323_Universal_sequential_search_problems","310661318_Inclusion_dependencies_and_their_interaction_with_functional_dependencies_in_SQL","305750168_Complexity_of_validity_for_propositional_dependence_logics","304621137_Expressivity_and_Complexity_of_Dependence_Logic","304018223_Characterizing_Relative_Frame_Definability_in_Team_Semantics_via_the_Universal_Modality","301890893_A_finite_axiomatization_of_conditional_independence_and_inclusion_dependencies","282181428_The_expressive_power_of_modal_logic_with_inclusion_atoms"]}
