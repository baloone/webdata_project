{"id":"262176379_Boundedly_Rational_Agents_Playing_the_Social_Actors_Game_How_to_Reach_Cooperation","abstract":"In any organizational setting, each of the participating actors adopts a quite steady behavior with respect to others. This behavior is not always in line with what might be expected given the role of the actor, although it is quite cooperative and most often contributes significantly to the proper operation of the organization. Within the framework of the SocLab approach for the modeling and analysis of organizations, we propose a model of the bounded rationality that social actors could implement in the process yielding the joint adaptation of their behaviors.","authors":["Christophe Sibertin-Blanc","Joseph El-Gemayel"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.135","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT) - Volume 02","Project: SocLab"],"references":["284557371_SocLab_A_Framework_for_the_Modeling_Simulation_and_Analysis_of_Power_in_Social_Organizations","264720507_Imitative_Games_by_9-_14-_and_18-Month-Old_Infants","306173475_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","286270780_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","284389044_Exploration_and_Exploitation_in_Organizational_Learning","249175842_Limitations_of_Rational_Choice_Theory","242617110_Theories_of_Bounded_Rationality","239062305_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_a_critical_survey","233822853_The_Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior","233820907_The_Principles_of_Learning_and_Behavior"]}
