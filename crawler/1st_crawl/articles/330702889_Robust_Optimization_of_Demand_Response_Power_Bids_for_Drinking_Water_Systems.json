A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Smart grids Demand response Peak electricity load Water supply Load shifting Mixed integer programming Water demand uncertainties A B S T R A C T The development of smart grids represents a major breakthrough in the management of electric power and drinking water systems. On the one hand, smart grids have contributed to the development of energy efficiency and demand side management mechanisms such as Demand Response, making it possible to reduce peak load and adapt elastic demand to fluctuation generation. On the other hand, smart water networks and sophisticated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems in the water industry have allowed one to optimize, control and monitor the water flow throughout its entire process. Being a highly energy intensive industry and having an electrical flexibility by the presence of storage elements such as tanks, drinking water systems have the ability to address energy efficiency mechanisms such as Demand Response. In this paper, the French demand response mechanism in spot power markets is presented. Then, a chance constrained problem is formulated to integrate water systems flexibility to power system operation, under water demand uncertainties. Numerical results are discussed based on a real water system in France, demonstrating the relevance of the approach in terms of financial benefits and risk management.","authors":["Chouaib Mkireb","Abel Dembélé","Antoine Jouglet","Thierry Denœux"],"meta":["January 2019Applied Energy 238(5):1036--1047","DOI:10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.124"],"references":["324379166_Optimal_Coordination_of_Water_Distribution_Energy_Flexibility_With_Power_Systems_Operation","322997623_Integrating_Water_Distribution_Energy_Flexibility_in_Power_Systems_Operation","322906865_Optimal_Demand_Response_Scheduling_for_Water_Distribution_Systems","316817602_Extending_the_Envelope_of_Demand_Response_Provision_though_Variable_Speed_Pumps","316184624_Investigating_trade-offs_between_the_operating_cost_and_green_house_gas_emissions_from_water_distribution_systems","296765595_Demonstrating_Demand_Response_from_Water_Distribution_System_through_Pump_Scheduling","282249022_Approximation_of_system_components_for_pump_scheduling_optimisation","280046897_Construire_la_valeur_d'un_service_energetique_la_trajectoire_de_l'effacement_diffus_en_France","259195759_Optimal_Demand_Response_Aggregation_in_Wholesale_Electricity_Markets","257228138_Optimal_sizing_and_operation_of_pumping_systems_to_achieve_energy_efficiency_and_load_shifting","240505114_Dynamic_Optimization_Approach_for_Solving_an_Optimal_Scheduling_Problem_in_Water_Distribution_Systems","225348280_Robust_solutions_of_Linear_Programming_problems_contaminated_with_uncertain_data","220244391_The_Price_of_Robustness","323733236_The_Long-Run_Efficiency_of_Real-Time_Electricity_Pricing","311533536_Optimal_demand_response_based_on_utility_maximization_in_power_networks","298704206_Water_distribution_solution_for_more_efficient_operation_of_water_supply","291980643_Recognizing_the_importance_of_demand_response_The_second_half_of_the_wholesale_electric_market_equation","290495413_A_convex_mathematical_program_for_pump_scheduling_in_a_class_of_branched_water_networks","290263512_Dynamic_Pricing_and_Distributed_Energy_Management_for_Demand_Response","283080476_Optimal_use_of_Demand_Response_Potentials_in_Medium-Sized_Industry_using_dynamic_Electricity_Tariffs","282392567_Optimal_Industrial_Load_Control_in_Smart_Grid","277608803_Iterative_Linearization_Scheme_for_Convex_Nonlinear_Equations_Application_to_Optimal_Operation_of_Water_Distribution_Systems","275055670_Empirical_Analysis_of_the_Merit-Order_Effect_and_the_Missing_Money_Problem_in_Power_Markets_With_High_RES_Shares","273278949_Mathematical_programming_techniques_in_water_network_optimization","261114780_Optimal_industrial_load_control_in_smart_grid_A_case_study_for_oil_refineries","259158760_Demand_response_and_smart_grids_-_A_survey","248879865_Optimal_Control_of_Water_Supply_Pumping_Systems","233932744_Which_electricity_market_design_to_encourage_the_development_of_demand_response","228387384_Water_Supply_Related_Electricity_Demand_in_California","227447732_Chance-Constrained_Programming","227412473_Load-management_applications_for_the_industrial_sector","226119120_Solution_of_a_class_of_stochastic_linear-convex_control_problems_using_deterministic_equivalents","224261517_Optimal_Demand_Response_Based_on_Utility_Maximization_in_Power_Networks","222644456_Chance_Constrained_Programming_with_Fuzzy_Parameters","23968885_The_Benefits_of_Customer_Participation_in_Wholesale_Electricity_Markets","4941353_Stochastic_Programming_in_Water_Management_A_Case_Study_and_a_Comparison_of_Solution_Techniques","4894340_Capacity_mechanisms_in_imperfect_electricity_markets","4254424_Closing_the_Loop_in_Water_Supply_Optimisation"]}
