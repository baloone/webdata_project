Machine\nlearning and AI ( artificial intelligence ) is a field of study that comes from computer science, mathematics and\npsychology and philosophy. Its ultimate goal is developing a system that provides a solution to task in a faster and\nstraight forward manner.\nMachine learning processes learn from the data that the system has been prompted, distinguishing between relevant and\nirrelevant patterns in data. It can make previsions and monitoring the result come from data in real-time.\nA comparison between the characteristics of ML and traditional econometric models (e.g., ARIMA and GARCH) found\nout that machine learning has a huge advantage over methods proposed by classical statistics/econometrics (Sendhil\nMullainathan, 2014). ML algorithms can manage a large amount of both structured and unstructured data and make\nfaster decisions and projections. Such a superior performance is possible as ML models do not make any pre-specified\nassumptions about the functional form of the equation, the interaction between variables, and the statistical distribution\nof parameters (Hamed Ghoddusi 2019). This paper is focused on a general approach to the most common machine\nlearnings technics in credit scoring approach discussed in the last years, discovering positive aspects and weak\npoint/criticism according to the main literature.","authors":["Federico Innocenti"],"meta":["April 2020","Project: Machine Learning in Finance"],"references":[]}
