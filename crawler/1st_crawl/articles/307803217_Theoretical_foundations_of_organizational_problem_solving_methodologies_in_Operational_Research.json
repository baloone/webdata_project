{"id":"307803217_Theoretical_foundations_of_organizational_problem_solving_methodologies_in_Operational_Research","abstract":"Paradigms are some principles and assumptions, which define frameworks and research priorities in each discipline. Many believe that operational research (OR) is not a science and like many other sciences does not have any paradigm. However, since OR is committed to scientific methods, therefore it contains a methodological paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to consider theoretical methodologies in the field of OR. This paper performs a review on the existing literature based on interpretive hermeneutic approach. Based on literature review, the study determines four principles and assumptions for each OR paradigms and a classification of the methods are presented. The results show that OR has four main paradigms and there are many methods in OR fields to tackle a particular problem where each problem belongs to a particular paradigm. In addition, instead of using a particular method in problem situations, we can implement a combination of methodologies.","authors":["Seyyed Hasan Ghodsipoor","Ahmad Jafarnejad","Ali Mohaghar","Mohammad Hasan Maleki"],"meta":["June 2013Management Science Letters 3(6)","DOI:10.5267/j.msl.2013.04.026"],"references":["313440180_Multimethodology_Towards_a_framework_for_mixing_methodologies","346643489_German_Philosophy_1760-1860_The_Legacy_of_Idealism","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","304756211_OR_and_science","281562726_Researching_Lived_Experience_Human_Science_For_An_Action_Sensitive_Pedagogy","280200226_Systems_Thinking_-_Creative_Holism_for_Managers","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","258261941_Social_Theory_and_Political_Practice","245460333_Approaches_to_Social_Enquiry","245281142_Beyond_Methodology_Choice_Critical_Systems_Thinking_as_Critically_Systemic_Discourse"]}
