{"id":"342367840_Entanglement_concentration_service_for_the_quantum_Internet","abstract":"Here, we define the entanglement concentration service for the quantum Internet. The aim of the entanglement concentration service is to provide reliable, high-quality entanglement for a dedicated set of strongly connected quantum nodes in the quantum Internet. The objectives of the service are to simultaneously maximize the entanglement throughput of all entangled connections and to minimize the hop distance between the high-priority quantum nodes. We propose a method for the resolution of the entanglement concentration problem and provide a performance analysis.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["August 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-020-02716-3"],"references":["347427245_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Key_Distribution","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","341366393_Towards_storage_rings_as_quantum_computers","341349587_Towards_a_Distributed_Quantum_Computing_Ecosystem","339917893_Performance_Analysis_of_Quantum_Channels","339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","339317656_Entanglement_accessibility_measures_for_the_quantum_Internet","341635351_Approximate_approximation_on_a_quantum_annealer","340922426_Blind_channel_estimation_for_continuous-variable_quantum_key_distribution"]}
