{"id":"303042386_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Students_Assessment_Data","abstract":"Higher education, throughout the world is delivered through universities, colleges affiliated to various universities and some other recognized academic institutes. Today one of the biggest challenges, the educational institutions face, is the explosive growth of educational data and to use this data to improve the quality of managerial decisions to deliver quality education. In this paper we will perform a case study of a university that hopes to improve the quality of education by analyzing the data and discover the factors that affect the academic results so as to increase success chances of students. In this perspective we use association rules discovery techniques. Also we will show the importance of data preprocessing in data analysis which has a significant impact on the accuracy of the predicted results.","authors":["Varun Kumar","Anupama Chadha"],"meta":["September 2012International Journal of Computer Science Issues 9(5):211-216"],"references":["242076740_Mining_Student_Data_Using_Decision_Trees","224504176_Uncovering_Hidden_Information_Within_University's_Student_Enrollment_Data_Using_Data_Mining","224160756_Educational_Data_Mining_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Art","292545397_Data_mining_model_for_higher_education_system","267917539_Research_on_Student_Learning_Result_System_based_on_Data_Mining","265741217_Knowledge_Mining_in_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Assessment_Data_of_Students'_Performance","263842523_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Technique","232623329_Apply_Data_Mining_to_Students'_Choosing_Teachers_Under_Complete_Credit_Hour","220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","220426710_The_KDD_Process_for_Extracting_Useful_Knowledge_from_Volumes_of_Data"]}
