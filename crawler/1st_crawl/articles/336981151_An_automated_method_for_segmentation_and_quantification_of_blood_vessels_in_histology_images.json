{"id":"336981151_An_automated_method_for_segmentation_and_quantification_of_blood_vessels_in_histology_images","abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neuro-degenerative disease that adversely affect many people on a global scale. Despite different diagnostic and therapeutic treatment, there is no cure for AD. The brain is one of the most complex organ and researchers are still trying to understand so as to find a cure.\n\nObjective: \nTo complement the efforts of clinical researchers engaged in research in alzheimer's disease, accurate segmentation and quantification of blood vessels in brain images is required.\n\nMethod: \nFor robust segmentation of blood vessels even in presence of colour variation, we introduce a fully automated morphological tool that can extract and quantify vessels from haematoxylin and diaminobenzidine stained histology brain image. The method, exploits saturation channel of stained image slides, ISODATA threshold method is applied to obtain a binary image. This helps in eliminating background and remaining with only blood vessels. A one-stage procedure that includes eliminating small artefacts is performed on the binary mask. The intensity of the image is transformed. Joining is performed to deal with fragmentation of intact blood vessels on the images, and artefactual appearance of the blood vessel structures. The artefactual fragments based on measured incoherence with neighbouring tissue are removed. The vessels are then labelled to facilitate quantification. Morphometric measurements are used during the vessel quantification assess both vessels with lumen and vessels without lumen. We have quantified the diameter of blood vessels.\n\nResults: \nThe image processing technique is developed in close collaboration with neuroscientist experts to help clinician. We have evaluated our proposed approach qualitatively. The method was validated against their manual quantification results. Qualitative results show that the method can indeed segment the blood vessels in presence of colour variations and artefacts. The quantitative method produces fairly better results.","authors":["Faiza Bukenya","Nerissa Culi","SÃ©bastien Serres","Marie-Christine Pardon"],"meta":["October 2019Microvascular Research
