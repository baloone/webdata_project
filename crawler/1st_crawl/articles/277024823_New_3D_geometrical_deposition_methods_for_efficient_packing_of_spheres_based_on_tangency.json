{"id":"277024823_New_3D_geometrical_deposition_methods_for_efficient_packing_of_spheres_based_on_tangency","abstract":"The morphology of many natural and man-made materials at different length scales can be simulated using particle-packing methods. This paper presents two novel 3D geometrical collective deposition algorithms for packed assemblies with prescribed distribution of radii: the “planar deposition” and the “3D-clew” method. The “planar deposition” method mimics an orderly granular flow through a funnel by stacking up spirally ordinated planar assemblies of spheres capable of achieving the theoretical maximum for monodisperse aggregates. The “3D-clew” method, instead, mimics the winding of a clew of yarn, thus yielding densely packed 3D poly-dispersed assemblies in terms of void ratio of the aggregate. The morphologies of such geometrically generated assemblies, achieved at several orders of magnitude reduced computational cost, are comparable to those consolidated uni-directionally by means of Discrete Element Method (DEM). In addition, significantly faster simulations of mechanical consolidation of granular media have been performed when relying upon the proposed geometrically generated assemblies as starting configurations.
