{"id":"319988976_Automatic_text_classification_using_BPLion-neural_network_and_semantic_word_processing","abstract":"Text mining has become a major research topic in which text classification is the important task for finding the relevant information from the new document. Accordingly, this paper presents a semantic word processing technique for text categorization that utilizes semantic keywords, instead of using independent features of the keywords in the documents. Hence, the dimensionality of the search space can be reduced. Here, the Back Propagation Lion algorithm (BP Lion algorithm) is also proposed to overcome the problem in updating the neuron weight. The proposed text classification methodology is experimented over two data sets, namely, 20 Newsgroup and Reuter. The performance of the proposed BPLion is analysed, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and compared with the performance of the existing works. The result shows that the proposed BPLion algorithm and semantic processing methodology classifies the documents with less training time and more classification accuracy of 90.9%.","authors":["Nihar Ranjan","Rajesh Prasad"],"meta":["September 2017Imaging Science Journal The 66(8):1-15","DOI:10.1080/13682199.2017.1376781","Project: Evolutionary Text Classification Model using Neural Network"],"references":["311944699_Feature_selection_based_on_a_normalized_difference_measure_for_text_classification","299496445_Ensemble_of_keyword_extraction_methods_and_classifiers_in_text_classification","292186555_A_Bayesian_Classification_Approach_Using_Class-Specific_Features_for_Text_Categorization","286240403_Lion_algorithm_for_standard_and_large_scale_bilinear_system_identification_A_global_optimization_based_on_Lion's_social_behavior","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","284094884_Optimization_and_label_propagation_in_bipartite_heterogeneous_networks_to_improve_transductive_classification_of_texts","284001081_Semantic_expansion_using_word_embedding_clustering_and_convolutional_neural_network_for_improving_short_text_classification","280970501_A_Comment_on_A_Similarity_Measure_for_Text_Classification_and_Clustering","280113723_Mining_Text_Data","268222482_A_Spanish_semantic_orientation_approach_to_domain_adaptation_for_polarity_classification"]}
