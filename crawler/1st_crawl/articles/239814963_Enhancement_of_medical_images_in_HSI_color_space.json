{"id":"239814963_Enhancement_of_medical_images_in_HSI_color_space","abstract":"In this paper we use the HSI color space as an alternative to RGB space. The HSI space considers the image as a combination of the components: hue, saturation and intensity. In this paper we propose to design a chromatic filter in order to obtain improvements in the enhancement of medical images. In image processing systems it is usual specify colors in a form compatible with the hardware used. The RGB color model, where is computationally convenient, is not very useful in the specification and color recognition. The human being does not recognize a color by having an amount of red, green or blue components, but uses attributes perceptual of hue, saturation and intensity. The chromatics models HSI, HLS, HSV, and its variants, encodes the color with the above attributes and are defined as intuitive spaces.","authors":["Eduardo Blotta","Agustina Bouchet","Virginia Laura Ballarin","J Pastore"],"meta":["December 2011Journal of Physics Conference Series 332(1)","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/332/1/012041"],"references":["262647846_Segmentacion_de_Imagenes_en_Color_utilizando_Histogramas_Bi-Variables_en_Espacios_Color_Polares_LuminanciaSaturacionMatiz","230978270_Barrett_esophagus_Guided_biopsies_taken_through_digital_image_processing","220539121_Color_in_Image_and_Video_Processing_Most_Recent_Trends_and_Future_Research_Directions","262483381_The_Whole_Brain_Atlas","222685082_Color_image_segmentation_Advances_and_prospects","221677990_Fundamental_of_Digital_Image_Processing","220690339_Digital_Image_Process","12817614_Barrett's_esophagus_congenital_or_acquired_An_experimental_study_of_esophageal_mucosal_regeneration_in_the_dog"]}
