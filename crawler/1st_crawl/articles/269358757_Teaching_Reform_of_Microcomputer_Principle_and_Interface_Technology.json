{"id":"269358757_Teaching_Reform_of_Microcomputer_Principle_and_Interface_Technology","abstract":"With the rapid development of computers and aggravation of competitiveness in employment, the course content system of Microcomputer Principle and Interface Technology with 8086/8088 CPU as the core is questioned by more and more people. Based on this, the course reform of Microcomputer Principle and Interface Technology was proposed. Recombining and optimizing the contents of \"Microcomputer Principle\" and \"Single-chip Microcomputer‚Äù. Constructing the course system with Micro Controller Unit (MCU) and embedded as the main contents. The ways of teaching reform was discussed and task-driven method, learning by doing teaching method and Proteus simulation software were applied in teaching effectively. The practice proves that the teaching reform obtains a better teaching effect, arouses students' learning initiative and improves the students' project practice ability, comprehensive application ability and innovation consciousness.","authors":["Li Qing Geng","Tong Zheng","Yan Bian","Shu Yan Ren"],"meta":["July 2011Advanced Materials Research 271-273:1737-1740","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.271-273.1737"],"references":[]}
