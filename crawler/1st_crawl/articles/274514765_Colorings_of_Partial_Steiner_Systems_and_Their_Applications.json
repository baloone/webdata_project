{"id":"274514765_Colorings_of_Partial_Steiner_Systems_and_Their_Applications","abstract":"This paper deals with extremal problems concerning colorings of partial Steiner systems. We establish a new sufficient condition for r-colorability of a hypergraph from some class of such systems in terms of maximum vertex degree. Moreover, as a corollary we obtain a new lower bound for the threshold probability for r-colorability of a random hypergraph in a binomial model.","authors":["Andrey Borisovich Kupavskii","Dmitry Shabanov"],"meta":["May 2015Journal of Mathematical Sciences 206(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10958-015-2330-8"],"references":["265681632_Problems_and_results_on_3-chromatic_Hypergraphs_and_some_related_questions","264957849_Sharp_thresholds_of_graph_properties_and_the_k-SAT_problem","225221757_On_the_2-Colorability_of_Random_Hypergraphs","51939042_The_condensation_transition_in_random_hypergraph_2-coloring","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","284674055_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","268496537_Random_Graphs","265425875_Choosability_in_Graphs","265359448_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","248830621_Coloring_graph_vertices_in_prescribed_colors","248639430_Necessary_and_su_cient_conditions_for_sharp_thresholds_of_graphs_properties_and_the_k_-_sat_problem","243107225_Combinatorische_Aufgabe","235737428_Random_Graph","227701220_Coloring_Uniform_Hypergraphs_With_Few_Edges","227701219_Two-Coloring_Random_Hypergraphs","227614312_An_application_of_Lovasz_Local_Lemma_-a_new_lower_bound_for_the_van_der_Waerden_number","227315806_The_chromatic_number_of_random_graphs","226692280_Coloring_Uniform_Hypergraphs_with_Small_Edge_Degrees","226558379_The_chromatic_number_of_random_graphs","225339671_Threshold_Functions","222701601_Choosability_in_Random_Hypergraphs","222293638_On_3-chromatic_hypergraphs","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220345735_Random_coloring_method_in_the_combinatorial_problem_of_Erdos_and_Lovasz","220345698_Improved_bounds_and_algorithms_for_hypergraph_2-coloring","220345398_An_Application_of_Lovasz's_Local_Lemma_-_A_New_Lower_Bound_for_the_van_der_Waerden_Number","220193230_On_-chromatic_hypergraphs","220076739_Coloring_n-Sets_Red_and_Blue","3785077_Improved_bounds_and_algorithms_for_hypergraph_two-coloring","2851575_The_Chromatic_Numbers_of_Random_Hypergraphs","2400065_A_Sharp_Threshold_for_k-Colorability"]}
