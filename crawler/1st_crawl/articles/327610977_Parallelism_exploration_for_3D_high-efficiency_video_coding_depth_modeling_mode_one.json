{"id":"327610977_Parallelism_exploration_for_3D_high-efficiency_video_coding_depth_modeling_mode_one","abstract":"This article presents a parallelism exploration over the depth modeling mode 1 (DMM-1) encoding algorithm of the 3D high-efficiency video coding (3D-HEVC) standard and applied the proposed solutions in a multicore central processing unit (CPU) and two graphics processor unities (GPU). The article evaluates efficient parallel algorithms for DMM-1, which also take advantage of simplifications proposed in our previous works. We demonstrate that DMM-1 can obtain a scalable speedup when running in systems with several available cores even when simplifications are being applied. Experimental results for 1920 × 1088 resolution videos show that the proposed parallel algorithms achieved up to 2 frames per second (fps) in a four-cores (with eight threads) CPU and more than 30 fps in two different GPUs. Therefore, the speedup attained with GPU enables real-time 3D-video encoding applying the proposed parallelism strategies together with the DMM-1 proposed simplifications.","authors":["Gustavo Sanchez","Luciano Volcan Agostini","Leonel Sousa","César Marcon"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Real-Time Image Processing 17(12)","DOI:10.1007/s11554-018-0819-3"],"references":["304027054_Real-time_scalable_hardware_architecture_for_3D-HEVC_bipartition_modes","303817772_Overview_of_the_high_efficiency_video_coding_standard","296477966_Fast_intra_mode_decision_for_depth_coding_in_3D-HEVC","283445270_Overview_of_efficient_high-quality_state-of-the-art_depth_enhancement_methods_by_thorough_design_space_exploration","313456518_3D-HEVC_depth_maps_intra_prediction_complexity_analysis","311239786_DFPS_A_fast_pattern_selector_for_depth_modeling_mode_1_in_three-dimensional_high-efficiency_video_coding_standard","309691501_GHEVC_An_Efficient_HEVC_Decoder_for_Graphics_Processing_Units","301409552_Generic_segment-wise_DC_for_3D-HEVC_depth_intra_coding","300313174_HEVC_Transform_and_Quantization","286462573_Complexity_reduction_for_3D-HEVC_depth_maps_intra-frame_prediction_using_simplified_edge_detector_algorithm","283001488_Overview_of_the_Multiview_and_3D_Extensions_of_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding","278016712_Fast_wedgelet_pattern_decision_for_DMM_in_3D-HEVC","276416833_Depth_Intra_Coding_for_3D_Video_Based_on_Geometric_Primitives","260631597_Standardized_Extensions_of_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding_HEVC","282743328_A_complexity_reduction_algorithm_for_depth_maps_intra_prediction_on_the_3D-HEVC"]}
