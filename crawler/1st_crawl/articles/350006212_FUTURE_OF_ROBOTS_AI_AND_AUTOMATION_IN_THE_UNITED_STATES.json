{"id":"350006212_FUTURE_OF_ROBOTS_AI_AND_AUTOMATION_IN_THE_UNITED_STATES","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly developing together with automation and robotics technologies which are at their tipping point. Recently, robots have been designed to perform diverse tasks without human interference. Automated systems, on the other hand, not only perform iterative tasks, but also greatly expand the capacities of the workers. It is also a fact that it is anticipated that digital computers will eventually replace more than half of the population worldwide. Multiple industries are introducing automation to drive their efficiency, profitability, protection, and competitiveness, ranging from banking to manufacturing. Therefore, in a super dynamic ecosystem, automation is here to support stability and accessibility. Thus, this reveals that automation's future is promising since everything will become easily available and accessible. Robotics are significantly changing the nature of works since the scale of its usage has changed from the last decade to recent years. However, it is worthy to note that technology is largely unchanged, but at the same time, connectivity has brought out the greatest benefits of all time. The scale at which robotics are adopted is continuously growing and has exploded within society. It is because, daily, new applications are created for all types of environments and industries. In various instances, automation improves the quality of production through its ability to provide precise repeatability that would have been impossible to achieve by relying on human labour. Therefore, there will be a greater integration between humans and Robots, AI and automation in the future. They will work together seamlessly to attain more efficient and effective results. Therefore, this research paper will illustrate the future of robots, AI, and automation, specifically in the United States, using the literature review context.","authors":["Ravi Teja Yarlagadda"],"meta":["February 2015SSRN Electronic Journal 1(5):6","Project: DevOps"],"references":["308787719_Technological_Growth_and_Unemployment_A_Global_Scenario_Analysis","302255967_Humans_Robots_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Autonomous_Entities_in_Space","236004293_Robotics_Technology_and_Flexible_Automation","220414978_Robots_and_the_changing_workforce"]}
