{"id":"220187017_Decomposition_of_sparse_graphs_with_application_to_game_coloring_number","abstract":"Let k be a nonnegative integer, and let mk = 4(k+1)(k+3) k2+6k+6 . We prove that every simple graph with maximum average degree less than mk decomposes into a forest and a subgraph with maximum degree at most k (furthermore, when k � 3 both subgraphs can be required to be forests). It follows that every simple graph with maximum average degree less than mk has game coloring number at most 4 + k.","authors":["Mickaël Montassier","Arnaud Pêcher","André Raspaud","Douglas B.
