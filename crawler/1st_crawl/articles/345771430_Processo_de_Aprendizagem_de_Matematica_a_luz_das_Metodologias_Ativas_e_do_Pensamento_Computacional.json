{"id":"345771430_Processo_de_Aprendizagem_de_Matematica_a_luz_das_Metodologias_Ativas_e_do_Pensamento_Computacional","abstract":"We seek to explain the process of learning mathematics when producing digital games and robotics devices for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in an environment that favors autonomy and the engaged creative process of social importance. Research activities were carried out at the IF-Goiano Mattics Project and at the Hospital do Idoso, guided by constructionist ideas, computational thinking, active learning methodologies and a qualitative research approach. The data were produced in classrooms and in the hospital, using robotics materials, including BBC micro: bit, MakeyMakey plates, software such as GeoGebra and Scratch, and were analyzed according to elements of Constructionism and Computational Thinking. As a result, we have found that the process of learning mathematics is characterized by the non-linear construction of meanings and marked by the dynamics of understanding, invention and application of mathematical knowledge to real problems addressed in society.","authors":["Greiton Toledo de Azevedo","Marcus Vinicius Maltempi"],"meta":["January 2020Ciência & Educação (Bauru) 26(ex. 2)","DOI:10.1590/1516-731320200061"],"references":["342575540_EDUCACAO_MAKER_ONDE_ESTA_O_CURRICULO","333516674_Jogos_digitais_e_educacao_uma_possibilidade_de_mudanca_da_abordagem_pedagogica_no_ensino_formal","330460827_Processo_formativo_do_aluno_em_matematica_jogos_digitais_e_tratamento_de_Parkinson","281495128_Digital_Fabrication_and_'Making'_in_Education_The_The_Democratization_of_Invention","335687491_Metodologias_ativas_de_aprendizagem_nas_aulas_de_Matematica_equacao_da_circunferencia_e_construcao_criativa_de_pontes","329648168_Lifelong_Kindergarten_Cultivating_Creativity_through_Projects_Passion_Peers_and_Play","329171157_Producao_de_Games_nas_Aulas_de_Matematica_Por_que_nao","317158625_Remaining_trouble_spots_with_computational_thinking","313501050_O_impacto_da_doenca_de_Parkinson_na_qualidade_de_vida_Uma_revisao_de_literatura","309311310_Travels_in_Troy_with_Freire_Technology_as_an_agent_of_emancipation"]}
