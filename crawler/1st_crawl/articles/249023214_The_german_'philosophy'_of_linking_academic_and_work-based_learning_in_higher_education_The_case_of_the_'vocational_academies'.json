One of the examples of a deeply rooted disinclination to reform is the Dual System of initial vocational training, which owes much of its reputation to the fact that it has remained one of the most frequently copied training systems in the world. Although the dualism of ‘learning venues’ may, at first glance, be the striking feature of this ‘German system’ of vocational training there is more to it, especially consensus among the groups involved in the system, the vocational principle as a didactical and structural parameter and also the remarkable contribution to standardisation and quality control from the state. The article depicts what may be seen as the successful transposition of these or similar principles into higher education. The result has been a kind of ‘academic Dual System’ that, despite its growing importance, is till a regional reform project since the emergence of the so-called ‘vocational academies’ (Berufsakademien) has virtually remained restricted to four of the 16 federal states of Germany.","authors":["Thomas Deissinger"],"meta":["December 2000Journal of Vocational Education and Training 52(4):605-626","DOI:10.1080/13636820000200134"],"references":["254459473_Miszellen_zur_Hochschulpolitik","249005073_Germany's_Vocational_Training_Act_Its_function_as_an_instrument_of_quality_control_within_a_tradition-based_vocational_training_system","249004875_Quality_Control_in_the_Dual_System_of_West_Germany","248975324_Changing_the_training_culture_Lessons_from_Anglo-German_comparisons_of_vocational_education_and_training","248917540_Really_Useful_Knowledge_The_New_Vocationalism_in_Higher_Education_and_its_Consequences_for_Mature_Students","233305614_The_Evolution_of_the_Modern_Vocational_Training_Systems_in_England_and_Germany_a_Comparative_View","233039846_Lessons_from_Germany_-_The_case_of_German_secondary_schools","44819705_Education_in_Germany_tradition_and_reform_in_historical_context","44818959_Developing_Meaningful_Links_Between_Higher_Education_and_Training","44818907_The_German_system_of_vocational_education_history_organization_prospects"]}
