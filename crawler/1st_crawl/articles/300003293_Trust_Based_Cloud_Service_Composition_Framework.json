{"id":"300003293_Trust_Based_Cloud_Service_Composition_Framework","abstract":"Cloud Computing plays an important role in academic and industry. Business process are composed and executed in the distributed loosely coupled environment. Business processes are implemented as the composite service which involves many services and these services connected by different workflow patterns. Numerous functionally similar services are available in the cloud. As it is an on-demand service, cloud service consumer needs some Quality of Service factors in services. Trust plays an import role in service selection. Selecting the trust worthy service for service composition with the cost and other constraints is a tedious task. In this paper, service trust estimation method based on Beta distribution is proposed. Trust based Cloud service selection framework for service composition is proposed and it is proved that the proposed framework provides better performance as compared to the well-known service composition methods based on the execution time and optimality value.","authors":["N.
