{"id":"317161158_Panorama_to_Panorama_Matching_for_Location_Recognition","abstract":"Location recognition is commonly treated as visual instance retrieval on \"street view\" imagery. The dataset items and queries are panoramic views, i.e. groups of images taken at a single location. This work introduces a novel panorama-to-panorama matching process, either by aggregating features of individual images in a group or by explicitly constructing a larger panorama. In either case, multiple views are used as queries. We reach near perfect location recognition on a standard benchmark with only four query views.","authors":["Ahmet Iscen","Giorgos Tolias","Yannis Avrithis","Teddy Furon"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3078971.3079033","Conference: the 2017 ACM"],"references":["310440696_Efficient_Diffusion_on_Region_Manifolds_Recovering_Small_Objects_with_Compact_CNN_Representations","308277792_CNN_Image_Retrieval_Learns_from_BoW_Unsupervised_Fine-Tuning_with_Hard_Examples","284578950_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition","280700585_Early_burst_detection_for_memory-efficient_image_retrieval","269935506_A_Baseline_for_Visual_Instance_Retrieval_with_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","269417608_Memory_Vectors_for_Similarity_Search_in_High-Dimensional_Spaces","262332080_Worldwide_Pose_Estimation_Using_3D_Point_Clouds","260298103_To_Aggregate_or_Not_to_aggregate_Selective_Match_Kernels_for_Image_Search","221364977_From_structure-from-motion_point_clouds_to_fast_location_recognition","320968445_Efficient_Diffusion_on_Region_Manifolds_Recovering_Small_Objects_with_Compact_CNN_Representations","319770310_City-Scale_Location_Recognition","319770116_Cross-dimensional_Weighting_for_Aggregated_Deep_Convolutional_Features","313682839_247_Place_Recognition_by_View_Synthesis","312823476_DisLocation_Scalable_Descriptor_Distinctiveness_for_Location_Recognition","311611056_Large-Scale_Location_Recognition_and_the_Geometric_Burstiness_Problem","311611050_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition","308857352_247_place_recognition_by_view_synthesis","308278386_Deep_Image_Retrieval_Learning_Global_Representations_for_Image_Search","308278021_Cross-Dimensional_Weighting_for_Aggregated_Deep_Convolutional_Features","304409315_PoseNet_A_Convolutional_Network_for_Real-Time_6-DOF_Camera_Relocalization","303902133_Scaling_Group_Testing_Similarity_Search","301880297_Deep_Image_Retrieval_Learning_global_representations_for_image_search","300482345_Memory_Vectors_for_Particular_Object_Retrieval_with_Multiple_Queries","284219425_Particular_object_retrieval_with_integral_max-pooling_of_CNN_activations","283279769_Aggregating_Deep_Convolutional_Features_for_Image_Retrieval","279258258_Triangulation_Embedding_and_Democratic_Aggregation_for_Image_Search","267687028_Multiple_queries_for_large_scale_specific_object_retrieval","267083372_Generalized_inverse_of_a_matrix_and_its_applications","264425714_Revisiting_the_Fisher_vector_for_fine-grained_classification","262328993_Improving_Image-Based_Localization_by_Active_Correspondence_Search","261479452_Visual_Place_Recognition_with_Repetitive_Structures","261440156_Neural_Codes_for_Image_Retrieval","261227248_Graph-Based_Discriminative_Learning_for_Location_Recognition","225133245_Automatic_Panoramic_Image_Stitching_using_Invariant_Features","224323330_IM2GPS_Estimating_geographic_information_from_a_single_image","221625886_Image_Based_Localization_in_Urban_Environments","221430025_Visual_localization_by_linear_combination_of_image_descriptors","221361339_City-Scale_Location_Recognition","221346314_FAB-MAP_Appearance-Based_Place_Recognition_and_Mapping_using_a_Learned_Visual_Vocabulary_Model"]}
