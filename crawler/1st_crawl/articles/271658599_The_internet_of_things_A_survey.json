{"id":"271658599_The_internet_of_things_A_survey","abstract":"In recent year, the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn significant research attention. IoT is considered as a part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating ‘things’. The future of the Internet will consist of heterogeneously connected devices that will further extend the borders of the world with physical entities and virtual components. The Internet of Things (IoT) will empower the connected things with new capabilities. In this survey, the definitions, architecture, fundamental technologies, and applications of IoT are systematically reviewed. Firstly, various definitions of IoT are introduced; secondly, emerging techniques for the implementation of IoT are discussed; thirdly, some open issues related to the IoT applications are explored; finally, the major challenges which need addressing by the research community and corresponding potential solutions are investigated.","authors":["Shancang Li","Li Da Xu","Shanshan Zhao"],"meta":["April 2014Information Systems Frontiers 17(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10796-014-9492-7"],"references":["264579348_A_New_Approach_for_Compliance_Checking_in_Service_Workflows","262321599_Information_systems_for_enterprise_integration_interoperability_and_networking_Theory_and_applications","262056566_An_Integrated_System_for_Regional_Environmental_Monitoring_and_Management_Based_on_Internet_of_Things","262056565_Developing_Vehicular_Data_Cloud_Services_in_the_IoT_Environment","303162721_Principled_Design_of_the_Modern_Web_Architecture","264750385_A_System_Framework_of_Security_Management_in_Enterprise_Systems","264579446_Compliance_Checking_for_Requirement-Oriented_Service_Workflow_Interoperations","263685998_Applying_Electromagnetic_Field_Theory_to_Study_the_Synergistic_Relationships_Between_Technology_Standardization_and_Technology_Development","263454210_Operations_Research_OR_in_Service_Industries_A_Comprehensive_Review","263330585_Enterprise_systems_in_Russia_1992-2012"]}
