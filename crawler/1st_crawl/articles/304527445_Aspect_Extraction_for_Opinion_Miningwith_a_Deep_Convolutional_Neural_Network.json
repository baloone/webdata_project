{"id":"304527445_Aspect_Extraction_for_Opinion_Miningwith_a_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"In this paper, we present the first deep learning approach to aspect extraction in opinion mining. Aspect extraction is a subtask of sentiment analysis that consists in identifying opinion targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the specific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising or complaining about. We used a 7-layer deep convolutional neural network to tag each word in opinionated sentences as either aspect or non-aspect word. We also developed a set of linguistic patterns for the same purpose and combined them with the neural network. The resulting ensemble classifier, coupled with a word-embedding model for sentiment analysis, allowed our approach to obtain significantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Soujanya Poria","Erik Cambria","Alexander Gelbukh"],"meta":["June 2016Knowledge-Based Systems 108","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2016.06.009","Project: Aspect based sentiment analysis"],"references":["282671979_Sentiment_Data_Flow_Analysis_by_Means_of_Dynamic_Linguistic_Patterns","280944711_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Textual_Features_and_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_for_Utterance-Level_Multimodal_Sentiment_Analysis","270952941_Guest_Editorial_Big_Social_Data_Analysis","268813106_SenticNet_3_A_Common_and_Common-Sense_Knowledge_Base_for_Cognition-Driven_Sentiment_Analysis","268037094_Mining_Topics_in_Documents_Standing_on_the_Shoulders_of_Big_Data","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","261283487_A_two-step_convolutional_neural_network_approach_for_semantic_role_labeling","258351847_Enriching_SenticNet_Polarity_Scores_Through_Semi-Supervised_Fuzzy_Clustering","221654582_Mining_and_summarizing_customer_reviews","221520217_A_holistic_lexicon-based_approach_to_opinion_mining","221444736_Red_Opal_Product-feature_scoring_from_reviews","220355406_Opinion_Word_Expansion_and_Target_Extraction_through_Double_Propagation","210279860_Extracting_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Single-_and_Cross-Domain_Setting_with_Conditional_Random_Fields","46428174_Incorporating_Domain_Knowledge_into_Topic_Modeling_via_Dirichlet_Forest_Priors","304535423_EtzioniO_Extracting_product_features_and_opinions_fromreviews","298799608_Affective_Computing_and_Sentiment_Analysis","285895924_Linguistic_regularities_in_continuous_space_word_representations","271483718_Merging_SenticNet_and_WordNet-Affect_emotion_lists_for_sentiment_analysis","263352838_Product_Aspect_Extraction_Supervised_with_Online_Domain_Knowledge","262350937_Statistical_Approaches_to_Concept-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","262305610_PoliTwi_Early_Detection_of_Emerging_Political_Topics_on_Twitter_and_the_Impact_on_Concept-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","262174457_Aspect_extraction_through_semi-supervised_modeling","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","242070706_Incorporating_Lexical_Priors_into_Topic_Models","221653225_Latent_Aspect_Rating_Analysis_on_Review_Text_Data_A_Rating_Regression_Approach","221012946_Jointly_Modeling_Aspects_and_Opinions_with_a_MaxEnt-LDA_Hybrid","220874072_Interactive_Topic_Modeling","220873078_Learning_Document-Level_Semantic_Properties_from_Free-Text_Annotations","220716974_Common_Sense_Computing_From_the_Society_of_Mind_to_Digital_Intuition_and_beyond","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220017593_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Indexing","215470741_Opinion_Integration_Through_Semi-supervised_Topic_Modeling","200744744_Modeling_human_motion_using_binary_latent_variables","200110377_Rated_aspect_summarization_of_short_comments","11207765_ARTICLE_Training_Products_of_Experts_by_Minimizing_Contrastive_Divergence","1906122_Modeling_Online_Reviews_with_Multi-grain_Topic_Models"]}
