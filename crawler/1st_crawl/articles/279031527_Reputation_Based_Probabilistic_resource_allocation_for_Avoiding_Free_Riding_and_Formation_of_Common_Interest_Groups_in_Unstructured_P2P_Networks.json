{"id":"279031527_Reputation_Based_Probabilistic_resource_allocation_for_Avoiding_Free_Riding_and_Formation_of_Common_Interest_Groups_in_Unstructured_P2P_Networks","abstract":"Free riding is a major problem in peer-to-peer networks. Reputation management\nsystems are generally employed to overcome this problem. In this paper, a new\nreputation based scheme called probabilistic resource allocation is proposed. This\nstrategy probabilistically decide whether to provide the resource to requesting peer or\nnot. Aforesaid method gives selection preference to higher reputation peers and at the\nsame time provides some finite probability of interaction between those peers who\ndon't have good reputation about each other. This avoids disconnection between the\naforesaid peers. The proposed scheme also introduces\na new mechanism for resource distribution which not only allocates resources based\non peers' reputation but simultaneously maximizes network utility also. Algorithm for\nformation of interest groups based upon both similarity of interests and reputation\nbetween peers is also presented.","authors":["Ruchir Gupta","Nitin Singha","Yatindra Singh"],"meta":["July 2015Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications","DOI:10.1007/s12083-015-0389-0","Project: Reputation Management System in Peer-to-Peer Networks"],"references":["258809968_socP2P_P2P_Content_Discovery_Enhancement_by_considering_Social_Networks_Characteristics","249995495_Avoiding_Whitewashing_in_Unstructured_Peer-to-Peer_Resource_Sharing_Network","236118860_Trust_Estimation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Network_Using_BLUE","224762520_Reputation-Based_Resource_Allocation_in_P2P_Systems_of_Rational_Users","224710792_Ranking-Based_Optimal_Resource_Allocation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","224393202_Free_Riding_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","221596327_Incentive_and_service_differentiation_in_P2P_networks_A_game_theoretic_approach","221455016_Reciprocal_resource_sharing_in_P2P_environments","4345802_Enhancing_Tit-for-Tat_Strategy_to_Cope_with_Free-Riding_in_Unreliable_P2P_Networks","3335242_Incentive_and_Service_Differentiation_in_P2P_Networks_A_Game_Theoretic_Approach","2384255_Free_Riding_on_Gnutella","277465191_Modeling_TCP_throughput","262891803_Trust-aware_query_routing_in_P2P_social_networks","261413700_An_Efficient_and_Trustworthy_P2P_and_Social_Network_Integrated_File_Sharing_System","257798562_A_grade-based_incentive_mechanism_with_starvation_prevention_for_maintaining_fairness_in_peer-to-peer_networks","254028537_New_P2P_Sharing_Incentive_Mechanism_Based_on_Social_Network_and_Game_Theory","246851118_Modeling_TCP_through-put_A_simple_model_and_its_empirical_validation","245036903_A_rational_model_for_service_rate_allocation_in_peer-to-peer","232643963_A_Solution_for_Whitewashing_in_P2P_Systems_Based_on_Observation_Preorder","222652814_Reputation-based_policies_that_provide_the_right_incentives_in_peer-to-peer_environments","221932953_Randomized_gossip_algorithms","221190838_A_Demand_and_Contribution_Based_Bandwidth_Allocation_Mechanism_in_P2P_Networks_A_Game-Theoretic_Analysis","4165711_A_Rational_Model_for_Service_Rate_Allocation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","3297975_GossipTrust_for_Fast_Reputation_Aggregation_in_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","3233587_Fundamental_design_issues_for_the_future_Internet","2939925_Robust_Incentive_Techniques_for_Peer-to-Peer_Networks","2635057_Modeling_TCP_Throughput_A_Simple_Model_and_its_Empirical_Validation","2416396_Differentiated_Admission_for_Peer-to-Peer_Systems_Incentivizing_Peers_to_Contribute_Their_Resources","2356422_Data_Networks_Are_Lightly_Utilized_and_Will_Stay_That_Way"]}
