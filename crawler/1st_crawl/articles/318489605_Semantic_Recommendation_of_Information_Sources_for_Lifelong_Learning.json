{"id":"318489605_Semantic_Recommendation_of_Information_Sources_for_Lifelong_Learning","abstract":"We propose a semantic recommendation of information sources, based on OWL/SWRL ontological reasoning, for the purpose of supporting learners in lifelong learning environments. We use the example of learners in the healthcare domain in order to demonstrate both: the availability of online information and learning sources which support lifelong learning in healthcare and the way we can address the needs of individual learners who are in a situation to learn informally. We focus on OWL/SWRL enabled computations because they (a) secure semantic interpretation of environments where lifelong learning takes place and (b) guarantee reasoning which results in recommendations of the best possible information sources for a particular instance of leaning.","authors":["Hamda Binghubash Almarri","Radmila Juric","Tanjina RAHMAN"],"meta":["June 2012","Conference: SDPSâ€™ 12- Society for Design and Process ScienceAt: Berlin, German"],"references":[]}
