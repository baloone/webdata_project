{"id":"307867699_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","abstract":"The interpolation by an idea/method which consists of the representation of numerical data by a suitable polynomial and then to compute the value of the dependent variable from the polynomial corresponding to any given value of the independent variable leads to the necessity of a formula for representing a given set of numerical data on a pair of variables by a suitable polynomial. One such formula has been developed in this study. The formula has been derived from Lagrangeâ€™s interpolation formula. The formula obtained has been applied to represent the numerical data, on the total population of India since 1971, by a suitable polynomial.","authors":["Biswajit Das","Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Mathematics Trends and Technology 34(2):64-72","DOI:10.14445/22315373/IJMTT-V34P514"],"references":["242911529_On_Lagrange-Hermite_Interpolation","288474773_Note_on_Interpolation","273772771_On_Interpolation_II_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Fundamental_Points_of_Lagrange_and_Hermite_Interpolation","268989954_An_introduction_to_analysis_by_Lagrange_interpolation","265437978_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula","243052483_A_Multi-Point_Generalization_of_Newton's_Divided_Difference_Formula","231870962_On_Lagrange_interpolation_with_equally_spaced_nodes"]}
