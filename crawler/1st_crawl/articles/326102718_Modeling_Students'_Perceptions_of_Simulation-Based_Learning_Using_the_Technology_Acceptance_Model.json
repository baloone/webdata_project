{"id":"326102718_Modeling_Students'_Perceptions_of_Simulation-Based_Learning_Using_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","abstract":"Background\nTechnology acceptance research seeks to account for user adoption behaviors, to predict behavioral intentions and use of technologies.\n\nMethods\nThis mixed-methods study tested a model of technology acceptance in the context of simulation-based learning, and reports on student perceptions of the learning environment in three cases from a Northeastern North American college nursing program using an extended technology acceptance survey instrument and simulation feedback form.\n\nResults\nThe model reproduced core and extended factors of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, behavioral intention, subjective norm, fidelity, and self-efficacy but not facilitating conditions.\n\nConclusions\nThe findings suggest that in a classroom environment meant to reproduce clinical situations as accurately as possible, students perceive fidelity as influencing their acceptance of SBL but not facilitating conditions. Thus, the extended model explained an important amount of variance in attitudes (R² = 62.7%) as well as behavioral intentions (R² = 68.3%) toward a clinically-oriented learning environment for practicing clinical skills, deepening conceptual understanding, applying knowledge, and learning teamwork and communication skills.","authors":["David Lemay","Matthew M.
