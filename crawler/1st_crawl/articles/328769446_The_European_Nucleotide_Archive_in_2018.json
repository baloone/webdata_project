{"id":"328769446_The_European_Nucleotide_Archive_in_2018","abstract":"The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), provided from EMBL-EBI, has for more than three decades been responsible for archiving the world's public sequencing data and presenting this important resource to the scientific community to support and accelerate the global research effort. Here, we outline ENA services and content in 2018 and provide an overview of a selection of focus areas of development work: extending data coordination services around ENA, sequence submissions through template expansion, early pre-submission validation tools and our move towards a new browser and retrieval infrastructure.","authors":["Peter W Harrison","Blaise Alako","Clara Amid","Ana Cerdeño-Tárraga"],"meta":["November 2018Nucleic Acids Research 47(Database issue)","DOI:10.1093/nar/gky1078"],"references":["328248019_FAANG_establishing_metadata_standards_validation_and_best_practices_for_the_farmed_and_companion_animal_community","314485721_Identifying_ELIXIR_Core_Data_Resources","308763751_2016_update_of_the_PRIDE_database_and_its_related_tools","287213055_The_European_Bioinformatics_Institute_in_2016_Data_growth_and_integration","283469905_2016_update_of_the_PRIDE_database_and_its_related_tools","279307187_The_European_Genome-phenome_Archive_of_human_data_consented_for_biomedical_research","321428987_The_international_nucleotide_sequence_database_collaboration","321107448_GenBank","320505278_DNA_Data_Bank_of_Japan_30th_anniversary","305375370_The_International_Nucleotide_Sequence_Database_Collaboration"]}
