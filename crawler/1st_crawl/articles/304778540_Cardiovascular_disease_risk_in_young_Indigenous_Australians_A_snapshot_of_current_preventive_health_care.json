Measurements included blood pressure (BP), blood glucose level (BGL), smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and lipid profile.\n\nResults: \nLast attendance was most commonly for acute care (46%); 12% attended for preventive assessment. BP was recorded in 85% (1,686/1,986), BGL 63% (1,244/1,986), smoking status 52% (1,033/1,986), BMI 37% (743/1,986) and lipids 31% (625/1,986). Of those with a recorded assessment, elevated BGL (39%, 479/1,244), smoking (63%, 649/1,033), overweight/obesity (51%, 381/743) and dyslipidaemia (73%, 458/625) were common. Follow-up of abnormal results was documented for elevated BP 28% (34/120), elevated BGL 17% (79/479), smoking 65% (421/649), overweight/obesity 11% (40/381) and abnormal lipids 16% (75/458).\n\nConclusions: \nThese findings highlight the importance of raising awareness and assessment of chronic disease risk factors in young Indigenous people and implementing preventive health care strategies.\n\nImplications: \nStrengthening the capacity of PHCs to provide preventive health care may contribute to reducing the chronic disease burden experienced by young Indigenous people.","authors":["Bethany Crinall","Jacqueline Boyle","Melanie Gibson-Helm","Danielle Esler"],"meta":["July 2016Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health 41(5)","DOI:10.1111/1753-6405.12547","Project: Centre for Research Excellence in Integrated Quality Improvement"],"references":["283662706_Continuous_quality_improvement_and_metabolic_screening_during_pregnancy_at_primary_health_centres_attended_by_Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_women","281244808_Quality_of_Primary_Health_Care_for_Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_People_in_Australia_-_Key_Research_Findings_and_Messages_for_Action_from_the_ABCD_National_Research_Partnership","265559772_Prepregnancy_body_mass_index_is_an_independent_risk_factor_for_gestational_hypertension_gestational_diabetes_preterm_labor_and_small-_and_large-for-gestational-age_infants","259385626_Improvement_in_rheumatic_fever_and_rheumatic_heart_disease_management_and_prevention_using_a_health_centre-based_continuous_quality_improvement_approach","259350801_A_systems-based_partnership_learning_model_for_strengthening_primary_healthcare","247153890_The_quality_of_health_research_for_young_Indigenous_Australians_Systematic_review","313678904_H_The_incidence_of_co-morbidities_related_to_obesity_and_overweight_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_BMC_Publ","285666363_The_incidence_of_co-morbidities_related_to_obesity_and_overweight_A_systematic_review_and_metaanalysis","277411066_Talking_About_The_Smokes_Summary_and_key_findings","237055233_Diabetes_in_young_people_in_the_Top_End_of_the_Northern_Territory"]}
