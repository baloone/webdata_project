{"id":"335748155_InstructableCrowd_Creating_IF-THEN_Rules_for_Smartphones_via_Conversations_with_the_Crowd","abstract":"Natural language interfaces have become a common part of modern digital life. Chatbots utilizetext-based conversations to communicate with users; personal assistants on smartphones such asGoogle Assistant take direct speech commands from their users; and speech-controlled devices suchas Amazon Echo use voice as their only input mode. In this paper, we introduceInstructableCrowd,a crowd-powered system that allows users to program their devices via conversation. The userverbally expresses a problem to the system, in which a group of crowd workers collectively respondand program relevant multi-part IF-THEN rules to help the user. The IF-THEN rules generated byInstructableCrowd connect relevant sensor combinations (e.g., location, weather, device acceleration,etc.) to useful effectors (e.g., text messages, device alarms,etc.). Our study showed that non-programmers can use the conversational interface of InstructableCrowd to create IF-THEN rulesthat have similar quality compared with the rules created manually. InstructableCrowd generallyillustrates how users may converse with their devices, not only to trigger simple voice commands,but also to personalize their increasingly powerful and complicated devices.","authors":["Ting-Hao K.
