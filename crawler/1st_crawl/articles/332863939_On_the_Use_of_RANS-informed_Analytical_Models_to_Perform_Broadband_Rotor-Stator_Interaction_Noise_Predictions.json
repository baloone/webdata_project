{"id":"332863939_On_the_Use_of_RANS-informed_Analytical_Models_to_Perform_Broadband_Rotor-Stator_Interaction_Noise_Predictions","abstract":"In 2018, a comprehensive data base of aerodynamic and acoustic measurements was obtained from a test campaign performed on the \"ACAT1\" Fan stage at the Universal Fan\nFacility for Acoustics (UFFA) of AneCom AeroTest (ACAT). The present paper describes a\nhybrid method coupling RANS simulations with analytical models to predict the broadband noise resulting from the interaction of the rotor wakes with the stator vanes, also named Rotor Stator Interaction (RSI) noise. Several operating points (approach, cutback and sideline) were tested on two different working lines (the Sea Level Static (SLS) working line and a Low Noise (LN) working line) on two configurations displaying different rotor-stator spacings (called Short Gap and Long Gap). The present study focuses on the Short Gap configuration, at approach condition on the SLS working line. The aerodynamic test data is directly compared with a Menter k-omega SST RANS simulation, which is in good agreement with the experimental performance parameters as well as with the hot-wire measurements in the interstage section. The acoustic power spectra computed from the microphone measurements are then compared with the broadband noise predictions performed using two analytical models representing the state of the art of analytical broadband RSI noise prediction: Hanson’s model and Posson’s model. The noise predictions obtained from these models recover quite faithfully the overall shape of the experimental acoustic power spectra. The absolute noise levels are underestimated by 1 to 5 dBs with respect to the measurements, depending on both the analytical model and the turbulence length scale estimation that are used. This underestimation can be attributed to the fact that some assumptions made within the analytical models may not be correct in the present configuration. Another explanation may be that there are other dominant noise sources that are responsible for the broadband noise production such as the rotor self noise Installation effects in the experiment may also be responsible for these discrepancies.","authors":["Danny Lewis","Stéphane Moreau","Marc C.
