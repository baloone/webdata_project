{"id":"275471307_A_Postverification_Method_for_Solving_Forced_Duffing_Oscillator_Problems_without_Prescribed_Periods","abstract":"This paper proposes a postverification method (PVM) for solving forced Duffing oscillator problems without prescribed periods. Comprising a postverification procedure and small random perturbation, the proposed PVM improves the sensitivity of the convergence of Newton's iteration. Numerical simulations revealed that the PVM is more accurate and robust than Kubíček's approach. We applied the PVM to previous research on bifurcation problems.","authors":["Hong-Yen Lin","Chien-Chang Yen","Kuo-Ching Jen","Kang C.
