The underlying model is the three-dimensional time-harmonic Maxwell equations in the electric field. Sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameters is performed, and explicit relations between the boundary measurements and the characteristics of the perturbations are found from an appropriate integral equation and extensive numerical simulations in 3D. The resulting non-iterative algorithm allows to retrieve efficiently the centre and volume of the perturbations in various situations from the simple sphere to a realistic model of the human head.","authors":["Marion Darbas","Jérémy Heleine","Stephanie Lohrengel"],"meta":["March 2019Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering 28(4):459-496","DOI:10.1080/17415977.2019.1588896"],"references":["322245417_EEG_in_neonates_Forward_modeling_and_sensitivity_analysis_with_respect_to_variations_of_the_conductivity","320266033_Inclusion_boundary_reconstruction_and_sensitivity_analysis_in_electrical_impedance_tomography","319123324_Numerical_resolution_of_an_electromagnetic_inverse_medium_problem_at_fixed_frequency","349706997_Inverse_Problems_for_Maxwell's_Equations","337067621_Inverse_Acoustic_and_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Theory","323621502_Topological_Sensitivity_for_Solving_Inverse_Multiple_Scattering_Problems_in_Three-Dimensional_Electromagnetism_Part_II_Iterative_Method","323439164_Multi-Wave_Medical_Imaging_Mathematical_Modelling_and_Imaging_Reconstruction","319238506_Numerical_Modeling_and_High-Speed_Parallel_Computing_New_Perspectives_on_Tomographic_Microwave_Imaging_for_Brain_Stroke_Detection_and_Monitoring","319167479_Topological_Sensitivity_for_Solving_Inverse_Multiple_Scattering_Problems_in_Three-dimensional_Electromagnetism_Part_I_One_Step_Method","316183804_Numerical_determination_of_anomalies_in_multifrequency_electrical_impedance_tomography"]}
