{"id":"314767117_Comparison_of_High_Speed_Congestion_Control_Protocols","abstract":"Congestion control limits the quantity of information input at a rate less important than that of the transmission one to ensure good performance as well as protect against overload and blocking of the network. Researchers have done a great deal of work on improving congestion control protocols, especially on high speed networks. In this paper, we will be studying the congestion control alongside low and high speed congestion control protocols. We will be also simulating, evaluating, and comparing eight of high speed congestion control protocols : Bic TCP, Cubic TCP, Hamilton TCP, HighSpeed TCP, Illinois TCP, Scalable TCP, Compound TCP and YeAH TCP, with multiple flows.","authors":["Jawhar Ben Abed"],"meta":["September 2012International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications 4(5):15-24","DOI:10.5121/ijnsa.2012.4502"],"references":["234800951_High_Speed_TCP_for_Large_Congestion_Windows","232707763_Performance_Evaluation_of_Competing_High-Speed_TCP_Protocols","228561173_YeAH-TCP_Yet_another_highspeed_TCP","222305729_Congestion_Control_and_Traffic_Management_in_ATM_Networks_Recent_Advances_and_A_Survey","220623913_CUBIC_a_new_TCP-friendly_high-speed_TCP_variant","42804218_Fairness_of_High-Speed_TCP_Protocols_with_Different_Flow_Capacities","4102828_Binary_increase_congestion_control_BIC_for_fast_long-distance_networks","290125015_Performance_Evaluation_of_High_Speed_Congestion_Control_Protocols","267228404_TCP_testing_-_Preventing_global_Internet_warming","228749476_Compound_TCP_A_scalable_and_TCP-friendly_congestion_control_for_high-speed_networks","222423784_TCP-Illinois_A_loss-_and_delay-based_congestion_control_algorithm_for_high-speed_networks","222397526_Impact_of_background_traffic_on_performance_of_high-speed_TCP_variant_protocols","31271895_Performance_Evaluation_and_Comparison_of_Transport_Protocols_for_Fast_Long-Distance_Networks","2316295_Automatic_TCP_buffer_tuning"]}
