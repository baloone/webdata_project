{"id":"320014426_On_Self-Dual_Four_Circulant_Codes","abstract":"Four circulant codes form a special class of $2$-generator, index $4$, quasi-cyclic codes. Under some conditions on their generator matrices they can be shown to be self-dual. Artin primitive root conjecture shows the existence of an infinite subclass of these codes satisfying a modified Gilbert-Varshamov bound.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Hongwei Zhu","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["September 2017International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science 29(07)","DOI:10.1142/S0129054118500259","Project: Algebraic codes are good"],"references":["320014258_On_self-dual_negacirculant_codes_of_index_two_and_four","301841558_On_self-dual_double_circulant_codes","220638635_On_the_Algebraic_Structure_of_Quasi-cyclic_Codes_II_Chain_Rings","313745663_On_complementary_dual_multinegacirculant_codes","311849120_On_self-dual_double_negacirculant_codes","284683881_On_Artin's_Conjecture","279968947_New_extremal_binary_self-dual_codes_from_a_modified_four_circulant_construction","265570259_Artin's_Primitive_Root_Conjecture_-_A_Survey","257481699_On_quasi-twisted_codes_over_finite_fields","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes"]}
