{"id":"316945954_Professional_Recognition_Matters_Certification_for_In-service_Computer_Science_Teachers","abstract":"In the context of rapid curriculum change, teaching computer science in school requires new skills and knowledge that existing teachers may not have. As well as a programme of teacher professional development (TPD), certification can be used to provide recognition to in-service teachers who have made the transition to computer science. The BCS Certificate in Computer Science Teaching has been designed and developed to give teachers professional recognition of their competence in teaching the computer science elements of the Computing curriculum. In this paper we describe the innovative design of this national certification and our experience over the last two years of its implementation; we are not aware of any similar scheme to offer professional recognition to in-service K-12 computer science teachers.","authors":["Sue Sentance","Andrew Csizmadia"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1145/3017680.3017752","Conference: the 2017 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium"],"references":["311484445_Community-oriented_pedagogy_for_in-service_CS_teacher_training","301429315_The_network_of_teaching_excellence_in_computer_science_and_master_teachers","283083838_Action_Research_in_Action","275994306_New_Methods_For_Learning_In_Computer_Science_Education","267154320_Understanding_continuing_professional_development_the_need_for_theory_to_impact_on_policy_and_practice","263551321_Regressed_experts_as_a_new_state_in_teachers'_professional_development_Lessons_from_Computer_Science_teachers'_adjustments_to_substantial_changes_in_the_curriculum","262470188_Computer_Science_in_Secondary_Schools_in_the_UK_Ways_to_Empower_Teachers","237327162_Professional_Learning_in_the_Learning_Profession_A_Status_Report_on_Teacher_Development_in_the_United_States_and_Abroad","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","233203583_Assessment_and_Learning_Differences_and_Relationships_between_Formative_and_Summative_Assessment","44836144_Inside_the_Black_Box_Raising_Standards_Through_Classroom_Assessment","300253853_Online_vs_Face-To-Face_Engagement_of_Computing_Teachers_for_their_Professional_Development_Needs","294425313_It_takes_a_village_supporting_inquiry-_and_equity-oriented_computer_science_pedagogy_through_a_professional_learning_community","290581864_What_else_should_CS_educators_know_-_Revisited","290330430_Teacher_Action_Research_Building_knowledge_democracies","290153658_Teacher_Development_in_Science_Education","287015999_A_Tale_of_Two_Modes_Initial_Reflections_on_an_Innovative_MOOC","285970744_Motivation_project-based_learning_Sustaining_the_doing_supporting_the_learning","281549555_Working_inside_the_black_box_Raising_standards_through_classroom_assessment","266655059_Adoption_of_new_computer_science_high_school_standards_by_New_Zealand_teachers","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools","250750529_If_You_Build_Teachers_Will_Students_Come_The_Role_of_Teachers_in_Broadening_Computer_Science_Learning_for_Urban_Youth","240534954_Emerging_policy_trends_Some_implications_for_continuing_professional_development","234827196_Implementing_a_computer_science_endorsement_program_for_secondary_school_teachers","234813132_In-service_education_for_teachers_of_computer_science","232543390_Motivating_Project-Based_Learning_Sustaining_the_Doing_Supporting_the_Learning","229640046_Professional_development_and_reform_in_science_education_The_role_of_teachers'_practical_knowledge","225268807_Formative_assessment_in_higher_education_Moves_towards_theory_and_the_enhancement_of_pedagogic_practice","220094613_Looking_at_Secondary_Teacher_Preparation_Through_the_Lens_of_Computer_Science"]}
