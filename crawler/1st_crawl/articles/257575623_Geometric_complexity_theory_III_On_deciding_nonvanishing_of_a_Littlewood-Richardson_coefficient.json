This means that the number of arithmetic operations is polynomial in n and independent of the bit lengths of the specifications of the partitions α,β, and γ, and each operation involves numbers whose bitlength is polynomial in n and the bit lengths α,β, and γ.\nSecondly, we observe that nonvanishing of a generalized Littlewood–Richardson coefficient of any type can be decided in strongly polynomial time assuming an analogue of the saturation conjecture for these types, and that for weights α,β,γ, the positivity of \n\n$c^{ 2\\gamma}_{2\\alpha, 2\\beta}$\ncan (unconditionally) be decided in strongly polynomial time.","authors":["Ketan Mulmuley","Hariharan Narayanan","Milind Sohoni"],"meta":["August 2012Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics 36(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10801-011-0325-1"],"references":["251751979_A_max-flow_algorithm_for_positivity_of_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients","228057795_A_New_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Linear_Programming-II","223466782_Deciding_Positivity_of_Littlewood-Richardson_Coefficients","220617516_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Computing_the_Smith_and_Hermite_Normal_Forms_of_an_Integer_Matrix","2143220_Tensor_product_multiplicities_canonical_bases_and_totally_positive_varieties","2117435_On_the_Computation_of_Clebsch-Gordan_Coefficients_and_the_Dilation_Effect","2115964_A_path_model_for_geodesics_in_Euclidean_buildings_and_its_applications_to_representation_theory","316823782_Algorithms_and_Combinatorics","316800668_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","313094775_Stretched_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients_and_Kostka_coefficients","309120661_A_polynomial_algorithm_in_linear_programming_in_Russian","266038630_On_P_vs_NP_and_Geometric_Complexity_Theory","266038448_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_VI_The_flip_via_positivity","265501794_A_polynomial_algorithm_in_linear_programming","261144494_Representation_Theory_A_First_Course","242562732_A_Strongly_Polynomial_Algorithm_to_Solve_Combinatorial_Linear_Programs","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222717831_On_vector_partition_functions","220618130_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_I_An_Approach_to_the_P_vs_NP_and_Related_Problems","220432359_On_P_vs_NP_and_geometric_complexity_theory_Dedicated_to_Sri_Ramakrishna","216877580_Geometric_Algorithms_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","46585349_Symmetric_quivers_invariant_theory_and_saturation_theorems_for_theclassical_groups","23702588_Polynomial_algorithm_in_linear_programming","2140065_The_honeycomb_model_of_GLnC_tensor_products_I_Proof_of_the_saturation_conjecture","2096713_Honeycombs_and_sums_of_Hermitian_matrices","1957814_Geometric_Complexity_III_on_deciding_positivity_of_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients","1884773_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_V_On_deciding_nonvanishing_of_a_generalizedLittlewood-Richardson_coefficient","1866885_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_II_Towards_Explicit_Obstructions_for_Embeddings_among_Class_Varieties","1758691_Eigencone_saturation_and_Horn_problems_for_symplectic_and_odd_orthogonal_groups"]}
