{"id":"315864199_Algorithms_and_Implementation_for_Segmenting_Tree_Log_Surface_Defects","abstract":"This paper focuses on the algorithms and implementation details of a published segmentation method defined to identify the defects of tree log surface. Such a method overcomes the difficulty of the high variability of the tree log surface and allows to segment the defects from the tree bark. All the algorithms used in this method are described in link to their source code which guarantees a full reproducible method associated to an online demonstration.","authors":["Van-Tho Nguyen","Bertrand Kerautret","Isabelle Debled-Rennesson","Francis Colin"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-56414-2_11","Conference: International Workshop on Reproducible Research in Pattern Recognition"],"references":["316449837_Centerline_detection_on_partial_mesh_scans_by_confidence_vote_in_accumulation_map","279310793_3D_Geometric_Analysis_of_Tubular_Objects_Based_on_Surface_Normal_Accumulation","260389906_A_new_approach_to_assessing_tree_stem_quality_characteristics_using_terrestrial_laser_scans","239581307_Approaches_for_Recognition_of_Wood_Quality_of_STanding_Trees_Based_on_Terrestrial_Laserscanner_Data","228663994_Automated_detection_of_severe_surface_defects_on_barked_hardwood_logs","266378625_Scalable_Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithms_for_High_Dimensional_Data","265560807_Knot_segmentation_in_3D_CT_images_of_wet_wood","263216136_Clear_wood_content_in_standing_trees_predicted_from_branch_scar_measurements_with_terrestrial_LiDAR_and_verified_with_X-ray_computed_tomography","246332708_GNU_Scientific_Library_Reference_Manual","228948482_A_graphical_automated_detection_system_to_locate_hardwood_log_surface_defects_using_high-resolution_three-dimensional_laser_scan_data"]}
