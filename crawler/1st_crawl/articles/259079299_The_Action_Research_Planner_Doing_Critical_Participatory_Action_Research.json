{"id":"259079299_The_Action_Research_Planner_Doing_Critical_Participatory_Action_Research","abstract":"A fully-updated and reworked version of the classic book by Stephen Kemmis and Robin McTaggart , now joined by Rhonda Nixon, The Action Research Planner is a detailed guide to developing and conducting a critical participatory action research project. The authors outline new views on ‘participation’ (based on Jürgen Habermas’s notion of a ‘public sphere’), ‘practice’ (as shaped by practice architectures), and ‘research’ (as research within practice traditions). They provide five extended examples of critical participatory action research studies. The book includes a range of resources for people planning a critical participatory research initiative, providing guidance on how to establish an action research group and identify a shared concern, research ethics, principles of procedure for action researchers, protocols for collaborative work, keeping a journal, gathering evidence, reporting, and choosing academic partners.\n\nUnlike earlier editions, The Action Research Planner focuses specifically on critical participatory action research, which occupies a particular (critical) niche in the action research 'family'.\n\nThe Action Research Planner is an essential guide to planning and undertaking this type of research.","authors":["Stephen Kemmis","Robin Mctaggart","Rhonda Nixon"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-981-4560-67-2","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-981-4560-66-5"],"references":["42795000_Systems_thinking_and_practice_for_action_research","313097321_Participatory_action_research","313005743_ACTION_RESEARCH_ITS_METHODS_AND_ITS_IMPLICATIONS","292001786_Action_research_for_the_twenty-first_century_Participation_reflection_and_practice","284902881_Always_together_yaka_gana_participatory_research_as_part_of_the_development_of_Yolngu_education","284413840_Practice_of_industry-mismanagement_of_people","273076453_Errata_An_Action-Research_Program_for_Increasing_Employee_Involvement_in_Problem_Solving","259079298_Changing_Practices_Changing_Education","248650607_The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action_Lifeworld_and_System_A_Critique_of_Functionalist_Reason","247932730_The_National_Development_Programme_in_Computer_Assisted_Learning_Final_Report_of_the_Director","238400485_Participatory_Action_Research_and_the_Public_Sphere","235358916_After_Virtue_A_study_in_Moral_Theory","200026500_The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action_Vol_1_Reason_and_The_Rationalization_Of_Society"]}
