{"id":"272353344_Inductive_Logic_Programming","abstract":"A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive characteristics of the parent subjects of Logic Programming and Machine Learning, it is hoped that the new area will overcome many of the limitations of its forebears. The background to present developments within this area is discussed and various goals and aspirations for the increasing body of researchers are identified. Inductive Logic Programming needs to be based on sound principles from both Logic and Statistics. On the side of statistical justification of hypotheses we discuss the possible relationship between Algorithmic Complexity theory and Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) Learning. In terms of logic we provide a unifying framework for Muggleton and Buntine’s Inverse Resolution (IR) and Plotkin’s Relative Least General Generalisation (RLGG) by rederiving RLGG in terms of IR. This leads to a discussion of the feasibility of extending the RLGG framework to allow for the invention of new predicates, previously discussed only within the context of IR.","authors":["Stephen Muggleton"],"meta":["February 1991New Generation Computing 8(4):295-318","DOI:10.1007/BF03037089","SourceDBLP"],"references":["239551812_Learning_Concepts_by_Asking_Questions","222440302_A_Model_of_Inexact_Reasoning_in_Medicine","220689181_Inductive_Acquisition_of_Expert_Knowledge","346830048_Lecture_on_the_Automatic_Computing_Engine_1947","292449684_Automatic_Methods_of_Inductive_Inference","285670741_Qualitative_Simulation","280939883_Qualitative_Simulation","274230386_The_Continuum_of_Inductive_Methods","268322838_The_Continuum_of_Inductive_Methods","267039334_Expert_Systems_in_Engineering_Applications","265620382_Information_randomness_and_incompleteness_Papers_on_algorithmic_information_theory_2nd_ed","262315792_Preservation_of_uncertainty_values_in_theory_reduction-a_reason_for_theoretical_terms","246718340_Logical_Depth_and_Physical_Complexity_The_Universal_Turing_Machine","246536216_Inverting_the_resolution_principle","243761731_Discovering_rules_from_large_collections_of_examples_a_case_study","239665656_A_Simple_Solution_for_Inverting_Resolution","239471479_Completing_logic_programs_by_inverse_resolution","238744294_PROLOG_Programming_for_Artificial_Intelligence","238710938_Systems_of_Logic_Based_on_Ordinals","238651290_A_formal_theory_of_inductive_inference_I","235625639_Logic_For_Problem_Solving","234786856_Expert_Systems_in_Engineering_Applications","226577787_Equivalences_of_Logic_Programs","226466290_Uber_formal_unentscheidbare_Satze_der_Principia_Mathematica_und_Verwandter_Systeme_I","223113805_Generalized_Subsumption_and_its_Application_to_Induction_and_Redundancy","222453050_Quantifying_Inductive_Bias_AI_Learning_Algorithms_and_Valiant's_Learning_Framework","222445347_Language_Identification_in_the_Limit","222437467_A_general_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_examples_needed_for_learning","221497426_A_General_Lower_Bound_on_the_Number_of_Examples_Needed_for_Learning","221497416_Learning_Simple_Deterministic_Languages","221345801_Limitations_On_Inductive_Learning","221345585_Machine_Invention_of_First_Order_Predicates_by_Inverting_Resolution","221112295_A_Study_of_Generalisation_in_Logic_Programs","220925353_Learning_in_the_Limit_in_a_Growing_Language","220837055_Generalised_Subsumption_and_its_Applications_to_Induction_and_Redundancy","220814626_Duce_An_Oracle-based_Approach_to_Constructive_Induction","220688574_The_Art_of_Prolog_-_Advanced_Programming_Techniques_2nd_Ed","220688293_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming_1st_Edition","220687903_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming_2nd_Edition","220431038_A_Machine-Oriented_Logic_Based_on_the_Resolution_Principle","220343973_Explanation-Based_Generalization_A_Unifying_View","200034171_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming","49553444_Collected_Works","34882266_Algorithmic_Program_Debugging","2745528_A_Strategy_for_Constructing_New_Predicates_in_First_Order_Logic","2720806_Efficient_Induction_Of_Logic_Programs"]}
