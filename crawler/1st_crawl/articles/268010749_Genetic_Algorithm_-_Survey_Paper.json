{"id":"268010749_Genetic_Algorithm_-_Survey_Paper","abstract":"This paper provides an introduction of Genetic Algorithm, its basic functionality. The basic functionality of Genetic Algorithm include various steps such as selection, crossover, mutation. This paper also focuses on the comparison of Genetic Algorithm with other problem solving technique. The details of labs that basically concentrate on the research and development of Genetic Algorithm is also included. The details of labs include the various projects that are carried out on Genetic Algorithm.","authors":["Anita M Thengade","Rucha Dondal"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","284650886_An_updated_survey_of_GA-based_multiobjective_optimization","220689401_An_Introduction_to_Genetic_Algorithms_MIT_Press_Cambridge","2465269_An_Overview_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Multiobjective_Optimization"]}
