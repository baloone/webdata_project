{"id":"226469800_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedures_Advances_Hybridizations_and_Applications","abstract":"GRASP is a multi-start metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, in which each iteration consists basically of\ntwo phases: construction and local search. The construction phase builds a feasible solution, whose neighborhood is investigated\nuntil a local minimum is found during the local search phase. The best overall solution is kept as the result. In this chapter,\nwe first describe the basic components of GRASP. Successful implementation techniques are discussed and illustrated by numerical\nresults obtained for different applications. Enhanced or alternative solution construction mechanisms and techniques to speed\nup the search are also described: alternative randomized greedy construction schemes, Reactive GRASP, cost perturbations,\nbias functions, memory and learning, local search on partially constructed solutions, hashing, and filtering. We also discuss\nimplementation strategies of memory-based intensification and post-optimization techniques using path-relinking. Hybridizations\nwith other metaheuristics, parallelization strategies, and applications are also reviewed.","authors":["Mauricio G. C. Resende","Celso C.
