{"id":"234784463_Programming_Techniques_Regular_expression_search_algorithm","abstract":"A method for locating specific character strings embedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler is discussed. The compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an IBM 7094 program as object language. The object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression. Examples, problems, and solutions are also presented.","authors":["Ken Thompson"],"meta":["June 1968Communications of the ACM 11(6):419-422","DOI:10.1145/363347.363387"],"references":["230876221_Multiple-Path_Syntactic_Analyzer","220430648_Derivatives_of_Regular_Expressions"]}
