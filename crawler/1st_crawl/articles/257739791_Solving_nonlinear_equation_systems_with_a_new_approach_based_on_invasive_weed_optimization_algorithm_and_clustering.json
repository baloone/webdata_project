{"id":"257739791_Solving_nonlinear_equation_systems_with_a_new_approach_based_on_invasive_weed_optimization_algorithm_and_clustering","abstract":"A novel optimization-based method for solving systems of nonlinear equations is proposed. The method employs Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) for solving nonlinear systems and can find all real and complex roots of a system and also detect multiplicity. The proposed solver consists of two parts: a two-phase root-finder that detects the solutions of a system using IWO algorithm, and an alteration technique which creates repulsion areas around previously found roots. The proposed solver determines all solutions using successive runs of the two-phase root-finder along with the alteration technique. Several illustrative examples together with three examples of engineering applications are provided to demonstrate merits of our proposed algorithm in solving nonlinear equations systems.","authors":["Ebrahim Pourjafari","Hamed Mojallali"],"meta":["June 2012Swarm and Evolutionary Computation 4:33â€“43","DOI:10.1016/j.swevo.2011.12.001"],"references":["224197195_A_Modified_Invasive_Weed_Optimization_Algorithm_for_training_of_feed-_forward_Neural_Networks","251855704_Helicopter_Trim_Research_Based_on_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm","250346415_Solving_systems_of_nonlinear_equations_with_continuous_GRASP","244387456_Finding_more_than_one_root_of_nonlinear_equations_via_a_polarization_technique_An_application_to_double_retrograde_vaporization","224240939_Antenna_Array_Optimization_Using_Dipole_Models_for_MIMO_Applications","224211358_Optimization_of_Printed_Yagi_Antenna_Using_Invasive_Weed_Optimization_IWO","224187710_Design_of_Non-Uniform_Circular_Antenna_Arrays_Using_a_Modified_Invasive_Weed_Optimization_Algorithm","223701361_Forward_kinematics_of_planar_parallel_manipulators_in_the_Clifford_algebra_of_P2","222950546_Hybrid_approach_for_solving_systems_of_nonlinear_equations_using_chaos_optimization_and_quasi-Newton_method","222656762_A_novel_numerical_optimization_algorithm_inspired_from_weed_colonization","221608636_Tuning_of_Auto-Disturbance_Rejection_Controller_Based_on_the_Invasive_Weed_Optimization","221470757_Using_hybrid_social_emotional_optimization_algorithm_with_Metropolis_rule_to_solve_nonlinear_equations","220512372_Particle_swarm_algorithm_for_solving_systems_of_nonlinear_equations","220199807_Multiobjective_invasive_weed_optimization_Application_to_analysis_of_Pareto_improvement_models_in_electricity_markets","220118803_An_ecologically_inspired_direct_search_method_for_solving_optimal_control_problems_with_Bezier_parameterization","4074884_A_fast_and_elitist_parallel_evolutionary_algorithm_for_solving_systems_of_non-linear_equations","3996658_Solving_systems_of_unconstrained_equations_using_particle_swarm_optimization","3412770_A_New_Approach_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations_Systems","2652823_Recent_Advances_in_Global_Optimization_for_Process_Synthesis_Design_and_Control_Enclosure_of_All_Solutions"]}
