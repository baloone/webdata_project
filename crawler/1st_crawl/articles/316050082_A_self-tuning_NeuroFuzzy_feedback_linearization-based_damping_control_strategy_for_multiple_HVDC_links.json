{"id":"316050082_A_self-tuning_NeuroFuzzy_feedback_linearization-based_damping_control_strategy_for_multiple_HVDC_links","abstract":"This research work proposes a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) online adaptive feedback linearization NeuroFuzzy control (AFLNFC) scheme to improve the damping of low frequency oscillations (LFOs) in an AC/DC power system. Optimized NeuroFuzzy identification architecture online captures the oscillatory dynamics of the power system through wide area measurement system (WAMS)-based measured speed signals of machines. Based on the identified power system model, the appropriate control law is derived through feedback linearization control with a self-tuned coefficient vector. The generated control signal modulates the real power flow through a high voltage direct current (HVDC) link during perturbed operating conditions and enhances system stability. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through different contingency conditions of a multi-machine test power system with multiple HVDC links. The results validate the significance of the proposed control strategy to improve the capability of HVDC links to damp inter-area modes of LFOs. The proposed MIMO AFLNFC performance is bench-marked against conventional PID based supplementary control.","authors":["Saghir Ahmad","Laiq Khan"],"meta":["January 2017Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences 25(2):913-938","DOI:10.3906/elk-1506-38"],"references":["260509541_Damping_of_Inter-Area_Oscillations_in_Mixed_ACDC_Networks_Using_WAMS_Based_Supplementary_Controller","44369003_Power_system_dynamics_and_stability_Peter_W_Sauer_and_M_A_Pai","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","285906939_Numerical_optimization","276371479_Hybrid_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_B-spline--based_SSSC_damping_control_paradigm_using_online_system_identification","271526479_High_Voltage_Direct_Current_Transmission_Vol_6","263253601_Enhancement_of_Power_System_Transient_Response_by_Control_of_HVDC_Converter_Power","262867619_Hybrid_Neuro-fuzzy_Legendre-based_Adaptive_Control_Algorithm_for_Static_Synchronous_Series_Compensator","260586140_Optimal_Coordination_of_a_Multiple_HVDC_Link_System_Using_Centralized_and_Distributed_Control","256970550_MIMO_feedback_linearization_control_for_power_systems","245155534_Coordinated_control_of_multiple_HVDC_links_using_input-output_exact_linearization","233530434_Power_System_Stability_and_Control","232324231_Robust_stabilization_of_feedback_linearizable_time-varying_uncertain_nonlinear_systems","224223735_Comparison_of_dynamic_performance_of_meshed_networks_with_different_types_of_HVDC_lines","222680141_A_nonlinear_robust_HVDC_control_for_a_parallel_ACDC_power_system","222139233_Hybrid_micro-GA_based_FLCs_for_TCSC_and_UPFC_in_a_multi-machine_environment","220133313_A_New_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_with_Guaranteed_Descent_and_an_Efficient_Line_Search","6666254_A_Fast_and_Accurate_Online_Sequential_Learning_Algorithm_for_Feedforward_Networks","4135804_GA_neuro-fuzzy_damping_control_system_for_UPFC_to_enhance_power_system_transient_stability","3861277_Feedback_linearization_of_nonlinear_systems_using_fuzzy_logic_systems","3438291_Power_System_Security_Assessment","3352243_Integrated_sliding-mode_adaptive-robust_control","3264615_Design_of_modulation_controllers_for_ACDC_power_systems"]}
