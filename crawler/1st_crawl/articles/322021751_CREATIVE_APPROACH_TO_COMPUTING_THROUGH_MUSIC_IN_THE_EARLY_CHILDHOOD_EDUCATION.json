{"id":"322021751_CREATIVE_APPROACH_TO_COMPUTING_THROUGH_MUSIC_IN_THE_EARLY_CHILDHOOD_EDUCATION","abstract":"This paper applies an experimental case study aiming at the assessment of the effectiveness of computer science teaching, when it is framed by activities with clear direction of \"creation and expression\" and in particular music. The research goes beyond the view that computers are a tool and examines them as a subject of the curriculum of the kindergarten through a creative didactic intervention. The sample was divided into two groups, the experimental group that implemented a training program for teaching basic computer concepts supported by alternative creative musical education activities and the control group which implemented a corresponding program that utilized ‚tutorials‛ and ‚drill and practice‛ software. The analysis of the data shows that computer literacy combined with music education activities had improved learning outcomes compared to the method used by guided teaching through software. The research supports the proposal for the development of educational approaches to computer science, which escapes from the narrow contexts of interaction with the PC, and is accompanied by alternative activities and adapted, as well to the particularities and characteristics of early childhood.","authors":["Michael Vitoulis"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.836282","Project: Digital Pedagogy"],"references":["313098381_Human_processing_predispositions_and_musical_universals","289744815_TEL_practices_in_preschool_and_kindergarten_education_Integrating_computer_use_and_computer_programming_in_off-computer_activities","262406050_Using_the_fun_toolkit_and_other_survey_methods_to_gather_opinions_in_Child_Computer_Interaction","255724072_Young_children's_musical_experiences_with_a_flow_machine","250151452_'Click_on_Miaow'_How_Children_of_Three_and_Four_Years_Experience_the_Nursery_Computer","313440004_'A_Day_in_the_Life'_advancing_a_methodology_for_the_cultural_study_of_development_and_learning_in_early_childhood","313074236_Towards_a_psychology_of_optimal_experience","306201541_Learning_with_technology_using_computers_as_cognitive_tools","259738826_Barriers_to_the_integration_of_computers_in_early_childhood_settings_Teachers'_perceptions","255658606_Buried_Treasure_The_Impact_of_Computer_Use_on_Young_Children's_Social_Cognitive_Language_Development_and_Motivation","242479057_Integrating_computer_use_and_computer_programming_in_off-_computer_preschool_and_kindergarten_activities","240732330_Musical_Characteristics_of_Preschool-Age_Students_A_Review_of_Literature","240714140_Lullaby_light_shows_Everyday_musical_experience_among_under-two-year-olds","240433672_The_intertextuality_of_children's_explanations_in_a_technology-enriched_early_years_science_classroom","238738974_An_introduction_to_computer_science_with_modula-2"]}
