{"id":"264346015_From_Academia_to_Start-up_A_Case_Study_with_Implications_for_Engineering_Education","abstract":"This study uses the characterization of contrasting modes of knowledge production to follow the activity of a group of engineers who migrated from an academic environment to a successful start-up firm. Qualitative data from interviews of two key members of the team were used to characterize their activities in the two settings. The authors relate the engineering practice described in the inter-views to the Gibbons Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge production phases and note the importance of a phase change in the transition between the two modes. The resultant case-study contributes material for use in role-play activity with engineering students to help develop interdisciplinary skills. The study also presents a critical analysis to evaluate the merits of the Mode 1 and Mode 2 framework for analysis of engineering practice at the level of the firm.","authors":["Bill Williams","Jos√© Figueiredo"],"meta":["February 2014","DOI:10.3991/ijep.v4i1.3236"],"references":["301850449_Five_Misunderstandings_About_Case-Study_Research","275657360_Engineering_Design_Processes_A_Comparison_of_Students_and_Expert_Practitioners","344055937_Epics_A_Model_Of_Service_Learning_In_An_Engineering_Curriculum","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","288591838_Comparing_engineering_practice_in_South_Asia_with_australia","286368227_What_we_know_And_Mostly_Don't_Know_about_Technical_Work","280863872_The_Secret_Language_of_Leadership_How_Leaders_Inspire_Action_through_Narrative","277815337_Designing_and_Conducting_Mixed_Method_Research","266918935_The_future_of_complexity_Conceiving_a_better_way_to_understand_order_and_chaos"]}
