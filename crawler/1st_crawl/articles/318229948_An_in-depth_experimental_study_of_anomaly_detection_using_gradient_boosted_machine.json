{"id":"318229948_An_in-depth_experimental_study_of_anomaly_detection_using_gradient_boosted_machine","abstract":"This paper proposes an improved detection performance of anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using gradient boosted machine (GBM). The best parameters of GBM are obtained by performing grid search. The performance of GBM is then compared with the four renowned classifiers, i.e. random forest, deep neural network, support vector machine, and classification and regression tree in terms of four performance measures, i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, false positive rate and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). From the experimental result, it can be revealed that GBM significantly outperforms the most recent IDS techniques, i.e. fuzzy classifier, two-tier classifier, GAR-forest, and tree-based classifier ensemble. These results are the highest so far applied on the complete features of three different datasets, i.e. NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and GPRS dataset using either tenfold cross-validation or hold-out method. Moreover, we prove our results by conducting two statistical significant tests which are yet to discover in the existing IDS researches.","authors":["Bayu Adhi Tama","Kyung Hyune Rhee"],"meta":["April 2019Neural Computing and Applications 31(4):955-965","DOI:10.1007/s00521-017-3128-z"],"references":["319096821_Classifier_Ensemble_Design_with_Rotation_Forest_to_Enhance_Attack_Detection_of_IDS_in_Wireless_Network","315416967_Performance_evaluation_of_intrusion_detection_system_using_classifier_ensembles","309091860_Performance_Analysis_of_Multiple_Classifier_System_in_DoS_Attack_Detection","304847859_The_evaluation_of_Network_Anomaly_Detection_Systems_Statistical_analysis_of_the_UNSW-NB15_data_set_and_the_comparison_with_the_KDD99_data_set","327606791_Classification_And_Regression_Trees","312538118_Support-vector_networks","310842623_A_practical_guide_to_support_vector_classification","310606656_Classification_and_regression_trees","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","304620894_Building_Predictive_Models_in_R_Using_the_caret_Package","304065067_An_effective_combining_classifier_approach_using_tree_algorithms_for_network_intrusion_detection","300125639_A_Combination_of_PSO-Based_Feature_Selection_and_Tree-Based_Classifiers_Ensemble_for_Intrusion_Detection_Systems","300332548_Improving_the_Accuracy_of_Intrusion_Detection_Using_GAR-Forest_with_Feature_Selection","288906520_Random_forests","288023219_A_Practical_Guide_to_Support_Vector_Classification"]}
