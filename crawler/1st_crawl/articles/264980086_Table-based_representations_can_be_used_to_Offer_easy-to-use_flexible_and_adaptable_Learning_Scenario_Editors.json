{"id":"264980086_Table-based_representations_can_be_used_to_Offer_easy-to-use_flexible_and_adaptable_Learning_Scenario_Editors","abstract":"This article presents an innovative approach to the design of learning scenario editors for teachers as not-specifically-trained users. The approach features simplicity, flexibility, and easy adaptation to local contexts and needs. It is based on the governing design decision to provide a basic representation device known to be easy to use and adopted by teachers in standard practice: a table, similar to that found in office suites. The table is put in structural correspondence with a pivotal model (a tree), which is used to implement services requiring complex mechanisms that can be found in state-of-the-art systems, for example instantiation support or operationalization. We show how this approach makes it possible to design simple, flexible editors that offer complex services as add-ons and are easy to adapt to users’ local needs, practices, and/or technical ecosystems.","authors":["Péricles Sobreira","Pierre Tchounikine"],"meta":["January 2014Computers & Education 80","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.002"],"references":["313447046_Generating_CSCL_scripts_From_a_conceptual_model_of_pattern_languages_to_the_design_of_real_scripts","269425374_Learning_design_Rashomon_II_Exploring_one_lesson_through_multiple_tools","265040239_Teacher_Beliefs_About_Educational_Software_A_Delphi_Study","262354515_Towards_a_script-aware_monitoring_process_of_computer-supported_collaborative_learning_scenarios","261884443_Computer-supported_collaboration_scripts_Theory_and_practice_of_scripting_CSCL_-_Perspectives_of_educational_psychology_and_computer_science","236960629_Learning_design_Rashomon_i_-_Supporting_the_design_of_one_lesson_through_different_approaches","230792878_Learning_design_Reflections_upon_the_current_landscape","228630349_A_classification_framework_for_educational_modeling_languages_in_instructional_design","226702731_A_Computer_Science_Perspective_on_Technology-Enhanced_Learning_Research","225645570_GLUE-PS_A_Multi-language_Architecture_and_Data_Model_to_Deploy_TEL_Designs_to_Multiple_Learning_Environments","225251368_Computer-Supported_Collaboration_Scripts","225149399_Specifying_Computer-Supported_Collaboration_Scripts","224255322_The_Conceptual_Structure_of_IMS_Learning_Design_Does_Not_Impede_Its_Use_for_Authoring","224095872_Considering_the_Intrinsic_Constraints_for_Groups_Management_of_TAPPS_and_Jigsaw_CLFPs","221423350_Learning_Activity_Spaces_Towards_Flexibility_in_Learning_Design","220374833_COLLAGE_A_collaborative_Learning_Design_editor_based_on_patterns","220374404_InstanceCollage_A_Tool_for_the_Particularization_of_Collaborative_IMS-LD_Scripts","220309221_The_mechanics_of_CSCL_macro_scripts","44111178_Technology_for_Classroom_Orchestration","43463568_Workflow_driven_e-learning_beyond_collaborative_environments","41758521_Report_of_the_Results_of_an_IMS_Learning_Design_Expert_Workshop","41146161_Design_and_enactment_of_Collaboration_Scripts_-_an_integrative_approach_with_graphical_notations_and_learning_platforms","37452560_Flexibility_in_macro_CSCL_scripts","285775512_Orchestrating_learning_in_a_one-to-one_technology_classroom","285751341_Lost_in_Translation_from_Abstract_Learning_Design_to_ICT_Implementation_A_Study_Using_Moodle_for_CSCL","285743319_Adopt_adapt_Structuring_sharing_and_reusing_asynchronous_collaborative_pedagogy","278718546_Computer_Science_and_Educational_Software_Design","269033623_Design_and_enactment_of_collaboration_scripts","267642867_CSCL_scripts_Interoperating_table_and_graph_representations","263774567_Exploring_teachers'_perceptions_on_different_CSCL_script_editing_tools","262348675_Design_for_classroom_orchestration","262324103_Clarifying_Design_for_Orchestration_Orchestration_and_Orchestrable_Technology_Scripting_and_Conducting","257681073_A_model_for_flexibly_editing_CSCL_scripts","234801715_Handbook_of_Visual_Languages_for_Instructional_Design_Theories_and_Practices","230470290_A_constructionist_learning_environment_for_teachers_to_model_learning_designs","229037228_Extending_a_Learning_Design_Editor_with_a_Monitoring_Component","226994699_Flexible_Scripting_in_Net-Based_Learning_Groups","221513275_LeadFlow4LD_Learning_and_Data_Flow_Composition-Based_Solution_for_Learning_Design_in_CSCL","220692055_Computer_Science_and_Educational_Software_Design_-_A_Resource_for_Multidisciplinary_Work_in_Technology_Enhanced_Learning","220663095_Flexibility_in_macro-scripts_for_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","220579066_Beyond_Models_and_Metaphors_Visual_Formalisms_in_User_Interface_Design","215615182_Technology-Enhanced_Learning_Design_Patterns_and_Pattern_Languages","32229698_Cultures_in_negotiation_Teachers'_acceptanceresistance_attitudes_considering_the_infusion_of_technology_into_schools"]}
