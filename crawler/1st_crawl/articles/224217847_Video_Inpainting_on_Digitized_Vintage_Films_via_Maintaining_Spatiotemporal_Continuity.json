{"id":"224217847_Video_Inpainting_on_Digitized_Vintage_Films_via_Maintaining_Spatiotemporal_Continuity","abstract":"Video inpainting is an important video enhancement technique used to facilitate the repair or editing of digital videos. It has been employed worldwide to transform cultural artifacts such as vintage videos/films into digital formats. However, the quality of such videos is usually very poor and often contain unstable luminance and damaged content. In this paper, we propose a video inpainting algorithm for repairing damaged content in digitized vintage films, focusing on maintaining good spatiotemporal continuity. The proposed algorithm utilizes two key techniques. Motion completion recovers missing motion information in damaged areas to maintain good temporal continuity. Frame completion repairs damaged frames to produce a visually pleasing video with good spatial continuity and stabilized luminance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on different types of video clips.","authors":["Nick C. Tang","Chiou-Ting Hsu","Chih-Wen Su","Timothy K.
