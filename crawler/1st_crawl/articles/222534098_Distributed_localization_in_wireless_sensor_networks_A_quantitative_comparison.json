{"id":"222534098_Distributed_localization_in_wireless_sensor_networks_A_quantitative_comparison","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of determining the node locations in ad-hoc sensor networks. We compare three distributed localization algorithms (Ad-hoc positioning, Robust positioning, and N-hop multilateration) on a single simulation platform. The algorithms share a common, three-phase structure: (1) determine nodeâ€“anchor distances, (2) compute node positions, and (3) optionally refine the positions through an iterative procedure. We present a detailed analysis comparing the various alternatives for each phase, as well as a head-to-head comparison of the complete algorithms. The main conclusion is that no single algorithm performs best; which algorithm is to be preferred depends on the conditions (range errors, connectivity, anchor fraction, etc.). In each case, however, there is significant room for improving accuracy and/or increasing coverage.","authors":["Koen Langendoen","Niels Reijers"],"meta":["November 2003Computer Networks 43(4):499-518","DOI:10.1016/S1389-1286(03)00356-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228541557_SpotON_An_Indoor_3D_Location_Sensing_Technology_Based_on_RF_Signal_Strength","228460521_The_OMNET_discrete_event_simulation_system","37402369_GPS-free_Positioning_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","3930444_Robust_Range_Estimation_Using_Acoustic_and_Multimodal_Sensing","3930246_Fault_Tolerant_Localization_for_Teams_of_Distributed_Robots","3924375_Ad_hoc_positioning_system_APS","3893900_Convex_position_estimation_in_wireless_sensor_networks","3508272_Real-time_vision-based_robot_localization","3344127_Gps-less_Low_Cost_Outdoor_Localization_for_Very_Small_Devices","3298423_Real-Time_Vision-Based_Robot_Localization","3196773_A_Survey_on_Sensor_Networks","2529202_Robust_Positioning_Algorithms_for_Distributed_Ad-Hoc_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","271418638_The_bits_and_flops_of_the_N-hop_multilateration_primitive_for_node_localization_problems","271418289_The_bits_and_flops_of_the_n-hop_multilateration_primitive_for_node_localization_problems","262254933_The_n-Hop_Multilateration_Primitive_for_Node_Localization_Problems","246714292_Location_Systems_for_Ubiquitous_Computing_Computer_Issue_on_Location_Aware_Computing","232644384_GPS-Free_Positioning_in_Mobile_ad-hoc_Networks","3321397_Source_Localization_and_Beamforming","3298223_Mobile_robot_localization_by_tracking_geometric_beacons","2955482_Location_Systems_for_Ubiquitous_Computing","2547734_Calibration_as_Parameter_Estimation_in_Sensor_Networks","2379924_The_Cricket_Location-Support_System","2367993_Geography-informed_Energy_Conservation_for_Ad_Hoc_Routing"]}
