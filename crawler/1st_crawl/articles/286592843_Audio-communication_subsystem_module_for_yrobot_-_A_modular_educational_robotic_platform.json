{"id":"286592843_Audio-communication_subsystem_module_for_yrobot_-_A_modular_educational_robotic_platform","abstract":"A mobile and modular educational robotic platform called “Yrobot” is presented for the purpose of increasing students interest in studying technical subjects, to support teaching and to promote the selected areas of the information and communication technologies. The developed mobile robotic system is open hardware. Its base part - a mobile robotic platform - is being continuously extended by expansion modules to enable the development and implementation of the specific applications. As the first expansion module for the “Yrobot”, an audio-communication subsystem module based on Texas Instruments solutions has been developed. This extension module is called “AudioCom” and allows the development and verification of the simple modulation techniques operation. These techniques are commonly used in the radio frequency communication as well. This paper describes the motivation for the development of the mentioned platform, the expansion module circuit design, software solution and the experimental testing results.","authors":["J.
