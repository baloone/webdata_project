{"id":"264381385_The_Impact_of_English_as_a_Global_Language_on_Educational_Policies_and_Practices_in_the_Asia-Pacific_Region","abstract":"This article presents the results of an investigation into the place of English in the curriculum in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The study indicates that the emergence of English as a global language is having considerable impact on policies and practices in all countries surveyed. However, it also reveals significant problems, including confusion and inconsistency, at the level of policy, particularly regarding the issue of age of initial instruction, inequity regarding access to effective language instruction, inadequately trained and skilled teachers, and a disjunction between curriculum rhetoric and pedagogical reality.","authors":["DAVID NUNAN"],"meta":["December 2003TESOL Quarterly 37(4)","DOI:10.2307/3588214"],"references":["285579146_Utilizing_the_Literatures_in_Teaching_the_Research_Paper","260353881_Age_and_L2_learning_The_hazards_of_matching_practical_implications_with_theoretical_facts_Comments_on_Stefka_H_Marinova-Todd_D_Bradford_Marshall_and_Catherine_E_Snow's_Three_Misconceptions_About_Age_a","313894009_A_survey_of_early_foreign_and_second_language_programmes","302936990_Korea's_English_education_policy_changes_in_the_1990s_Innovations_to_gear_the_nation_for_the_21st_century","264365893_English_as_a_Global_Language","260354422_Hold_Your_Courses_Language_Education_Language_Choice_and_Economic_Development","257757413_Three_Misconceptions_about_Age_and_L2_Learning","257306919_Missing_the_Point_A_Response_to_Hyltenstam_and_Abrahamsson","247702916_Team_teaching_A_case_study_from_Japan","235342083_English_as_a_global_language","234631019_Late_Immersion_and_Language_of_Instruction_English_vs_Chinese_in_Hong_Kong_High_Schools_Achievement_Growth_in_Language_and_Nonlanguage_Subjects","231794762_State_of_the_Art_Article_English_Teaching_and_Learning_in_China","49110424_The_Study_of_Second_Language_Acquisition_R_Ellis","39729676_Identifying_Research_Priorities_Themes_and_Directions_for_the_TESOL_International_Research_Foundation"]}
