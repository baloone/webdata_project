{"id":"236260578_Fast_dynamic_programming_for_locally_checkable_vertex_subset_and_vertex_partitioning_problems","abstract":"Given a graph G we provide dynamic programming algorithms for many locally checkable vertex subset and vertex partitioning problems. Their runtime is polynomial in the number of equivalence classes of problem-specific equivalence relations on subsets of vertices, defined on a given decomposition tree of G. Using these algorithms all these problems become solvable in polynomial time for many well-known graph classes like interval graphs and permutation graphs (Belmonte and Vatshelle (2013) [1]). Given a decomposition of boolean-width k we show that the algorithms will have runtime O(n^42^O^(^k^^^2^)), providing the first large class of problems solvable in fixed-parameter single-exponential time in boolean-width.","authors":["Binh-Minh Bui-Xuan","Jan Arne Telle","Martin Vatshelle"],"meta":["January 2012Theoretical Computer Science 511","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2013.01.009"],"references":["262272626_Finding_Good_Decompositions_for_Dynamic_Programming_on_Dense_Graphs","249386923_Width_Parameters_Beyond_Treewidth_and_their_Applications","236260582_New_width_parameters_of_graphs","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","225938834_Boolean-Width_of_Graphs","220992908_Boolean-Width_of_Graphs","220752934_On_the_Boolean-Width_of_a_Graph_Structure_and_Applications","220752509_Graph_Classes_with_Structured_Neighborhoods_and_Algorithmic_Applications","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","2483943_Partitioning_Graphs_Into_Generalized_Dominating_Sets","280688730_Algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_on_partial_-trees","242402935_Vertex_Partitioning_Problems_Characterization_Complexity_and_Algorithms_on_Partial_k-Trees","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","220992937_Parameterized_Complexity_of_the_Smallest_Degree_Constraint_Subgraph_Problem","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220153387_Algorithms_for_vertex-partitioning_problems_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","220064066_Locally_constrained_graph_homomorphisms-structure_complexity_and_applications","44364118_Boolean_matrix_theory_and_applications_Ki_Hang_Kim","36797698_Perfect_Codes_in_General_Graphs","2412192_Algorithms_For_Vertex_Partitioning_Problems_On_Partial_k-Trees"]}
