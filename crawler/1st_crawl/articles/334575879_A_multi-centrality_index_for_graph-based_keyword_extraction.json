{"id":"334575879_A_multi-centrality_index_for_graph-based_keyword_extraction","abstract":"Keyword extraction aims to capture the main topics of a document and is an important step in natural language processing (NLP) applications. The use of different graph centrality measures has been proposed to extract automatic keywords. However, there is no consensus yet on how these measures compare in this task. Here, we present the multi-centrality index (MCI) approach, which aims to find the optimal combination of word rankings according to the selection of centrality measures. We analyze nine centrality measures (Betweenness, Clustering Coefficient, Closeness, Degree, Eccentricity, Eigenvector, K-Core, PageRank, Structural Holes) for identifying keywords in co-occurrence word-graphs representation of documents. We perform experiments on three datasets of documents and demonstrate that all individual centrality methods achieve similar statistical results, while the proposed MCI approach significantly outperforms the individual centralities, three clustering algorithms, and previously reported results in the literature.","authors":["Didier Augusto Vega-Oliveros","Pedro Spoljaric Gomes","Evangelos E.
