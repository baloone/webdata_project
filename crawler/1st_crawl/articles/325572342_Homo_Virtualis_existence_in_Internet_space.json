{"id":"325572342_Homo_Virtualis_existence_in_Internet_space","abstract":"The study of a person existence in Internet space is certainly an actual task, since the Internet is not only a source of innovation, but also the cause of society's transformations and the social and cultural problems that arise in connection with this. Computer network is global. It is used by people of different professions, age, level and nature of education, living around the world and belonging to different cultures. It complicates the problem of developing common standards of behavior, a system of norms and rules that could be widely accepted by all users. On the other hand, the Internet space can be viewed as a new form of existence where physical laws do not work, and in connection with this, social ones are often questioned. This paper focuses on how social norms regulate relations in Internet space. The authors represents the typology of deviant behavior in the network. The empirical basis of the research includes the sociological survey of students of the senior courses in the Institute of Computer Science and Technology of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. Sociological survey allows to identify studentsâ€™ understanding of Internet space. The selection of students is conditioned by the fact that IT professionals are considered simultaneously as ordinary users of the network and as future professionals in this field.","authors":["Daria Bylieva","Victoria Lobatyuk","Anna Rubtsova"],"meta":["January 2018SHS Web of Conferences 44:00021","DOI:10.1051/shsconf/20184400021","Project: Internet as new type of space"],"references":["323089252_Sci-Hub_provides_access_to_nearly_all_scholarly_literature","287405371_Society_of_things_An_alternative_vision_of_Internet_of_things","271189565_The_Social_Internet_Frustrating_Enriching_but_Not_Lonely","301717796_Who's_downloading_pirated_papers_Everyone"]}
