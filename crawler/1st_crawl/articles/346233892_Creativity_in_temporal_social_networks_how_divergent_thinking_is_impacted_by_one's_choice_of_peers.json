{"id":"346233892_Creativity_in_temporal_social_networks_how_divergent_thinking_is_impacted_by_one's_choice_of_peers","abstract":"Creativity is viewed as one of the most important skills in the context of future-of-work. In this paper, we explore how the dynamic (self-organizing) nature of social networks impacts the fostering of creative ideas. We run six trials ( N = 288) of a web-based experiment involving divergent ideation tasks. We find that network connections gradually adapt to individual creative performances, as the participants predominantly seek to follow high-performing peers for creative inspirations. We unearth both opportunities and bottlenecks afforded by such self-organization. While exposure to high-performing peers is associated with better creative performances of the followers, we see a counter-effect that choosing to follow the same peers introduces semantic similarities in the followersâ€™ ideas. We formulate an agent-based simulation model to capture these intuitions in a tractable manner, and experiment with corner cases of various simulation parameters to assess the generality of the findings. Our findings may help design large-scale interventions to improve the creative aptitude of people interacting in a social network.","authors":["Raiyan Abdul Baten","Daryl Bagley","Ashely Tenesaca","Famous Clark"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of The Royal Society Interface 17(171):20200667","DOI:10.1098/rsif.2020.0667"],"references":["341317328_Adaptive_social_networks_promote_the_wisdom_of_crowds","338204745_Upskilling_Together_How_Peer-interaction_Influences_Speaking-skills_Development_Online","332388436_Toward_understanding_the_impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_labor","331085879_Large_teams_develop_and_small_teams_disrupt_science_and_technology","326486266_Unpacking_the_polarization_of_workplace_skills","325577502_Buildup_of_speaking_skills_in_an_online_learning_community_a_network-analytic_exploration","313642438_The_Beneficial_Role_of_Mobility_for_the_Emergence_of_Innovation","306922796_Self-branding_'micro-celebrity'_and_the_rise_of_Social_Media_Influencers","301879516_Solving_Optimization_Problems_by_the_Public_Goods_Game","294732666_Dynamic_Creative_Interaction_Networks_and_Team_Creativity_Evolution_A_Longitudinal_Study","289915960_ARTool_Aligned_Rank_Transform_for_Nonparametric_Factorial_ANOVAs_R_package_version_0100","279400115_Electronic_Brainstorming","258127887_Making_Group_Brainstorming_More_Effective_Recommendations_From_an_Associative_Memory_Perspective","255643349_The_Red_Queen_Effect_Competitive_Actions_And_Firm_Performance","247151700_A_Semantic_Network_Approach_to_the_Creativity_Quotient_CQ","221514774_The_Aligned_Rank_Transform_for_Nonparametric_Factorial_Analyses_Using_Only_ANOVA_Procedures","220837848_An_Intrinsic_Information_Content_Metric_for_Semantic_Similarity_in_WordNet","51235677_The_Cultural_Niche_Why_Social_Learning_Is_Essential_for_Human_Adaptation","38092561_Social_Networks_Personal_Values_and_Creativity_Evidence_for_Curvilinear_and_Interaction_Effects","17752937_Size_performance_and_potential_in_brainstorming_groups","6927451_How_the_Group_Affects_the_Mind_A_Cognitive_Model_of_Idea_Generation_in_Groups","6017734_Humans_Have_Evolved_Specialized_Skills_of_Social_Cognition_The_Cultural_Intelligence_Hypothesis","331138236_The_Secret_of_Our_Success_How_Culture_Is_Driving_Human_Evolution_Domesticating_Our_Species_and_Making_Us_Smarter","326623303_Making_ai_into_jobs","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","306146231_From_word_embeddings_to_document_distances","301931995_Comparing_Different_Sensemaking_Approaches_for_Large-Scale_Ideation","285070273_Theories_of_creativity","261768023_Give_Your_Ideas_Some_Legs_The_Positive_Effect_of_Walking_on_Creative_Thinking","234021812_Social_Yet_Creative_The_Role_Of_Social_Relationships_In_Facilitating_Individual_Creativity","234021404_Structural_Holes_and_Good_Ideas","231002931_Making_new_connections_towards_cooperation_in_the_Prisoner's_Dilemma_game","227533540_Toward_More_Creative_and_Innovative_Group_Idea_Generation_A_Cognitive-Social-Motivational_Perspective_of_Brainstorming","223744465_Creativity_and_technological_learning_The_roles_of_organization_architecture_and_crisis_in_large-scale_projects","220040293_Groups_Teams_and_Creativity_The_Creative_Potential_of_Idea-Generating_Groups","200044309_WordNet_A_Lexical_Database_for_English","51798957_Dynamic_social_networks_promote_cooperation_in_experiments_with_humans","47335022_Motivated_Information_Processing_Social_Tuning_and_Group_Creativity","46636275_Cognitive_Stimulation_and_Interference_in_Idea-Generating_Groups","38018317_Coevolutionary_games-A_mini_review","1783052_Semantic_Similarity_Based_on_Corpus_Statistics_and_Lexical_Taxonomy"]}
