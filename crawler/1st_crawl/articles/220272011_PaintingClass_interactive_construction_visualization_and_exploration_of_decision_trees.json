{"id":"220272011_PaintingClass_interactive_construction_visualization_and_exploration_of_decision_trees","abstract":"Decision trees are commonly used for classification. We propose to use decision trees not just for classification but also for the wider purpose of knowledge discovery, because visualizing the decision tree can reveal much valuable information in the data. We introduce PaintingClass, a system for interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees. PaintingClass provides an intuitive layout and convenient navigation of the decision tree. PaintingClass also provides the user the means to interactively construct the decision tree. Each node in the decision tree is displayed as a visual projection of the data. Through actual examples and comparison with other classification methods, we show that the user can effectively use PaintingClass to construct a decision tree and explore the decision tree to gain additional knowledge.","authors":["Soon Tee Teoh","Kwan-Liu Ma"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1145/956750.956837","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Washington, DC, USA, August 24 - 27, 2003"],"references":["248284447_Using_the_ADAP_Learning_Algorithm_to_Forcast_the_Onset_of_Diabetes_Mellitus","221654449_Visual_Classification_An_Interactive_Approach_to_Decision_Tree_Construction","221311447_An_Interval_Classifier_for_Database_Mining_Applications","221103130_SLIQ_A_fast_scalable_classifier_for_data_mining","3940257_Classification_with_Degree_of_Membership_A_Fuzzy_Approach","2669468_Scaling_Up_the_Accuracy_of_Naive-Bayes_Classifiers_a_Decision-Tree_Hybrid","2630812_Towards_an_Effective_Cooperation_of_the_Computer_and_the_User_for_Classification","2496913_Constructive_Neural_Network_Learning_Algorithms_for_Pattern_Classification","2424791_CLOUDS_A_decision_tree_classifier_for_large_datasets","2321570_Integrating_Classification_and_Association_Rule_Mining","248747653_Introduction_to_IND_Version_2","221654444_Visualizing_multi-dimensional_clusters_trends_and_outliers_using_Star_Coordinates","221006050_Case_Study_Visualization_for_Decision_Tree_Analysis_in_Data_Mining","220907088_StarClass_Interactive_Visual_Classification_Using_Star_Coordinates","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220316575_A_general_neural_framework_for_classification_rule_mining","5596137_Fuzzy_Decision_Trees_Issues_and_Methods","2514534_A_General_Neural_Framework_for_Classification_Rule_Mining","2414414_Data_Mining_Criteria_for_Tree-Based_Regression_and_Classification"]}
