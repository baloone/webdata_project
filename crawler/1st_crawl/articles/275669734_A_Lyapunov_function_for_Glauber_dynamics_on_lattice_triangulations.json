{"id":"275669734_A_Lyapunov_function_for_Glauber_dynamics_on_lattice_triangulations","abstract":"We study random triangulations of the integer points $[0,n]^2\n\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^2$, where each triangulation $\\sigma$ has probability measure\n$\\lambda^{|\\sigma|}$ with $|\\sigma|$ denoting the sum of the length of the\nedges in $\\sigma$. Such triangulations are called \\emph{lattice\ntriangulations}. We construct a height function on lattice triangulations and\nprove that, in the whole subcritical regime $\\lambda<1$, the function behaves\nas a \\emph{Lyapunov function} with respect to Glauber dynamics; that is, the\nfunction is a supermartingale. We show the applicability of the above result by\nestablishing several features of lattice triangulations, such as tightness of\nlocal measures, exponential tail of edge lengths, crossings of small triangles,\nand decay of correlations in thin rectangles. These are the first results on\nlattice triangulations that are valid in the whole subcritical regime\n$\\lambda<1$. In a very recent work with Caputo, Martinelli and Sinclair, we\napply this Lyapunov function to establish tight bounds on the mixing time of\nGlauber dynamics in thin rectangles that hold for all $\\lambda<1$. The Lyapunov\nfunction result here holds in great generality; it holds for triangulations of\ngeneral lattice polygons (instead of the $[0,n]^2$ square) and also in the\npresence of arbitrary constraint edges.","authors":["Alexandre Stauffer"],"meta":["October 2017Probability Theory and Related Fields 169(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s00440-016-0735-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["270763507_Unimodular_lattice_triangulations_as_small-world_and_scale-free_random_graphs","268319215_Two-Dimensional_Lorentzian_Models","345825440_Counting_lattice_triangulations","316805749_Discriminants_Resultants_and_Multidimensional_Determinants","282726981_Phase_Transitions_in_Random_Dyadic_Tilings_and_Rectangular_Dissections","277145039_Dynamics_of_Lattice_Triangulations_on_Thin_Rectangles","269339078_Entropy_of_unimodular_Lattice_Triangulations","267121476_Random_triangulations_of_planar_points_sets","266986624_Triangulations_Structures_for_algorithms_and_applications","238388071_Real_plane_algebraic_curves_construction_with_controlled_topology"]}
