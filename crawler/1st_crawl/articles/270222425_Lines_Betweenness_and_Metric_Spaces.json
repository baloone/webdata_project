{"id":"270222425_Lines_Betweenness_and_Metric_Spaces","abstract":"A classic theorem of Euclidean geometry asserts that any noncollinear set of\n$n$ points in the plane determines at least $n$ distinct lines. Chen and\nChv\\'atal conjectured that this holds for an arbitrary finite metric space,\nwith a certain natural definition of lines in a metric space.\nWe prove that in any metric space with $n$ points, either there is a line\ncontaining all the points or there are at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ lines. This\nis the first polynomial lower bound on the number of lines in general finite\nmetric spaces. In the more general setting of pseudometric betweenness, we\nprove a corresponding bound of $\\Omega(n^{2/5})$ lines. When the metric space\nis induced by a connected graph, we prove that either there is a line\ncontaining all the points or there are $\\Omega(n^{4/7})$ lines, improving the\nprevious $\\Omega(n^{2/7})$ bound. We also prove that the number of lines in an\n$n$-point metric space is at least $n / 5w$, where $w$ is the number of\ndifferent distances in the space, and we give an $\\Omega(n^{4/3})$ lower bound\non the number of lines in metric spaces induced by graphs with constant\ndiameter, as well as spaces where all the positive distances are from \\{1, 2,\n3\\}.","authors":["Pierre Aboulker","Xiaomin Chen","Guangda Huzhang","Rohan Kapadia"],"meta":["September 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9806-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["285909427_Three_point_collinearity_Problem_4065","285898545_Solution_to_problem_4065","271738323_A_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem_for_1-2_metric_spaces","260340541_Graph_metric_with_no_proper_inclusion_between_lines","259239932_The_Chen-Chv'atal_conjecture_for_metric_spaces_induced_by_distance-hereditary_graphs","257429129_Towards_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_in_the_L_1-Metric","256097260_Number_of_lines_in_hypergraphs","247152244_Introduction_to_Geometry","237128705_A_Combinatorial_Problem","232203526_Graph_Theory","221660734_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_for_Chordal_Graphs","230595915_A_Decomposition_Theorem_for_Partially_Ordered_Sets","225238362_Unterschungen_uber_Allgemeine_Metrik","224907194_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem_for_1-2_metric_spaces","220570058_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem"]}
