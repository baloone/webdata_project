{"id":"302923317_ConSurf_2016_an_improved_methodology_to_estimate_and_visualize_evolutionary_conservation_in_macromolecules","abstract":"The degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid in a protein or a nucleic acid in DNA/RNA reflects a balance between\nits natural tendency to mutate and the overall need to retain the structural integrity and function of the macromolecule.\nThe ConSurf web server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il), established over 15 years ago, analyses the evolutionary pattern of the amino/nucleic acids of the macromolecule to reveal\nregions that are important for structure and/or function. Starting from a query sequence or structure, the server automatically\ncollects homologues, infers their multiple sequence alignment and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree that reflects their evolutionary\nrelations. These data are then used, within a probabilistic framework, to estimate the evolutionary rates of each sequence\nposition. Here we introduce several new features into ConSurf, including automatic selection of the best evolutionary model\nused to infer the rates, the ability to homology-model query proteins, prediction of the secondary structure of query RNA\nmolecules from sequence, the ability to view the biological assembly of a query (in addition to the single chain), mapping\nof the conservation grades onto 2D RNA models and an advanced view of the phylogenetic tree that enables interactively rerunning\nConSurf with the taxa of a sub-tree.","authors":["Haim Ashkenazy","Shiran Abadi","Eric Martz","Ofer Chay"],"meta":["May 2016Nucleic Acids Research 44(Web Server issue):gkw408","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkw408"],"references":["290395773_UniRef_Clusters_A_comprehensive_and_scalable_alternative_for_improving_sequence_similarity_searches","285628746_Wasabi_An_Integrated_Platform_for_Evolutionary_Sequence_Analysis_and_Data_Visualization","281667618_Rfam_120_Updates_to_the_RNA_families_database","277713280_Probabilistic_multi-template_protein_homology_modeling","311100584_A_Model_of_Evolutionary_Change_in_Proteins","303750599_Rfam_120_Updates_to_the_RNA_families_database","295246155_Structural_basis_of_outer_membrane_protein_insertion_by_the_BAM_complex","292669469_The_bacterial_dicarboxylate_transporter_VcINDY_uses_a_two-domain_elevator-type_mechanism","291164955_Causes_of_evolutionary_rate_variation_among_protein_sites","284700005_The_phylogenetic_handbook_A_practical_approach_to_DNA_and_protein_phylogeny","271592314_Structure_and_activity_of_tryptophan-rich_TSPO_proteins","268873185_The_RCSB_Protein_Data_Bank_Views_of_structural_biology_for_basic_and_applied_research_and_education","271196714_New_Look_at_Statistical-Model_Identification","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","269845002_Importance_of_the_reverse_Hoogsteen_base_pair_54-58_for_tRNA_function"]}
