{"id":"316371301_Mining_High-Utility_Itemsets_with_Both_Positive_and_Negative_Unit_Profits_from_Uncertain_Databases","abstract":"Some important limitation of frequent itemset mining are that it assumes that each item cannot appear more than once in each transaction, and all items have the same importance (weight, cost, risk, unit profit or value). These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications. For example, consider a database of customer transactions containing information about the purchase quantities of items in each transaction and the positive or negative unit profit of each item. Besides, uncertainty is commonly embedded in collected data in real-life applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm named HUPNU (mining High-Utility itemsets with both Positive and Negative unit profits from Uncertain databases), the high qualified patterns can be discovered effectively for decision-making. Based on the designed vertical PUÂ±-list (Probability-Utility list with Positive-and-Negative profits) structure and several pruning strategies, HUPNU can directly discovers the potential high-utility itemsets without generating candidates.","authors":["Wensheng Gan","Chun-Wei Jerry Lin","Philippe Fournier Viger","Han-Chieh Chao"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-57454-7_34","Conference: Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","Project: UPM: utility-oriented pattern mining"],"references":["290759751_FHN_Efficient_Mining_of_High-Utility_Itemsets_with_Negative_Unit_Profits","263696687_FHM_Faster_High-Utility_Itemset_Mining_Using_Estimated_Utility_Co-occurrence_Pruning","262369808_Mining_high_utility_itemsets_without_candidate_generation","224329541_A_Survey_of_Uncertain_Data_Algorithms_and_Applications","220906932_A_Foundational_Approach_to_Mining_Itemset_Utilities_from_Databases","235949400_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_High_Utility_Itemsets_from_Transactional_Databases","224384927_Efficient_Tree_Structures_for_High_Utility_Pattern_Mining_in_Incremental_Databases","222836609_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_high_utility_itemsets_with_negative_item_values_in_large_databases","221900765_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Large_Databases","221654150_Probabilistic_frequent_itemset_mining_in_uncertain_databases"]}
