{"id":"257697506_A_column_generation-based_heuristic_algorithm_for_an_inventory_routing_problem_with_perishable_goods","abstract":"An inventory routing problem is a variation of the vehicle routing problem in which inventory and routing decisions are determined simultaneously over a given time horizon. The objective is to minimize the sum of transportation and inventory costs. In this paper, we study a specific inventory routing problem in which goods are perishable (PIRP). We develop a mathematical model for PIRP and exploit its structure to develop a column generation-based solution approach. Cutting planes are added to improve the formulation. We present computational experiments to demonstrate that our methodology is effective, and that the integration of routing and inventory can yield significant cost savings.","authors":["Tung H.
