{"id":"226432754_Robust_Inventory_Ship_Routing_by_Column_Generation","abstract":"We consider a real integrated ship scheduling and inventory management problem. A fleet of ships transports a single product\nbetween production and consumption plants. The transporter has the responsibility for keeping the inventory level within its\nlimits at all actual plants, and there should be no need to stop the production at any plants caused by missing transportation\npossibilities.\n\nDue to uncertainties in sailing time, we introduce soft inventory constraints and artificial penalty costs to the underlying\nmodel. The model is solved by a column generation approach. By introducing some model adjustments, the problem decomposes\ninto a routing and scheduling subproblem for each ship and an inventory management subproblem for each port. The columns in\nthe master problem represent ship schedules and port call sequences.","authors":["Marielle Christiansen","Bj√∏rn Nygreen"],"meta":["January 1970","DOI:10.1007/0-387-25486-2_7","In book: Column Generation (pp.197-224)"],"references":["230596630_Time_Constrained_Routing_and_Scheduling","230596621_A_Unified_Framework_for_Deterministic_Time_Constrained_Vehicle_Routing_and_Crew_Scheduling_Problems","220413292_Dynamic_Programming_Approximations_for_a_Stochastic_Inventory_Routing_Problem","220412954_Ship_Routing_and_Scheduling_Status_and_Perspectives","220209250_A_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Path_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Linear_Node_Costs","325680720_Marine_inventory_routing_Shipments_planning","284503742_Combining_exact_and_heuristic_methods_for_solving_a_vessel_routing_problem_with_inventory_constraints_and_time_windows","242916545_A_method_for_solving_ship_routing_problemswith_inventory_constraints","233312027_Determination_of_optimal_shipping_policy_by_inventory_theory","229886319_Robust_ship_scheduling_with_multiple_time_windows","228631958_Maritime_transportation","4915725_Planning_of_fuel_coal_imports_using_a_mixed_integer_programming_method"]}
