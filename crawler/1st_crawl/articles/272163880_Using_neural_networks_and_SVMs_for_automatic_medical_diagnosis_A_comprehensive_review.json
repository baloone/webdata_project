{"id":"272163880_Using_neural_networks_and_SVMs_for_automatic_medical_diagnosis_A_comprehensive_review","abstract":"In this paper we make a comprehensive review regarding the use of neural networks in automated medical diagnosis, with a special emphasis in Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are specialized types of neural functions. Through the study, we see that, in many cases, symptoms and diseases can be efficiently predicted by neural systems, while SVMs are increasingly used in medical diagnosis due to their accurate classification characteristics.","authors":["D.
