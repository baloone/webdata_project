{"id":"278969519_Representation-Compatible_Power_Indices","abstract":"This paper studies power indices based on average representations of a\nweighted game. If restricted to account for the lack of power of dummy voters,\naverage representations become coherent measures of voting power, with power\ndistributions being proportional to the distribution of weights in the average\nrepresentation. This makes these indices representation-compatible, a property\nnot fulfilled by classical power indices. Average representations can be\ntailored to reveal the equivalence classes of voters defined by the Isbell\ndesirability relation, which leads to a pair of new power indices that ascribes\nequal power to all members of an equivalence class.","authors":["Serguei Kaniovski","Sascha Kurz"],"meta":["May 2018Annals of Operations Research 264(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-017-2672-3","SourcearXiv","Project: Decision theory and voting"],"references":["262071534_The_Average_Representation_-_A_Cornucopia_of_Power_Indices","259128345_The_minimum_sum_representation_as_an_index_of_voting_power","257246671_The_nucleolus_of_large_majority_games","332942701_Voting_Weights_and_Formateur_Advantages_in_the_Formation_of_Coalition_Governments","313124372_A_method_for_evaluating_the_distribution_of_power_in_a_committee_system","303920031_Weighted_voting_does_not_work_a_mathematical_analysis","266162707_Mathematics_and_Politics_Strategy_Voting_Power_and_Proof","265547007_Common_internal_properties_among_power_indices","256044449_The_Geometry_of_Voting_Power_Weighted_Voting_and_Hyper--Ellipsoids","248414237_Weighted_Voting_Doesn't_Work_A_Mathematical_Analysis"]}
