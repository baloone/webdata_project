{"id":"326719322_JAMRIS_nr_2-2018_01Castillo","abstract":"Fuzzy logic has always been one of the key research areas\nin the field of computer science as it helps in dealing\nwith the real world vagueness and uncertainty. In recent\nyears, a variant of it, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has gained enormous\npopularity for research purposes. In this paper, an\nanalytical insight is provided into the research patterns\nof Type-2 Fuzzy logic. Web of Science has been used as\nthe data source which consists of Science Citation Index-\nExpanded (SCI-E), SSCI, A&HCI and ESCI indexed research\npapers. 600 research papers were extracted from it in the\nfield of Type-2 fuzzy logic from the year 2000 to 2016,\nwhich are analyzed both manually and in an automated\nmanner.","authors":["Sonakshi Vij","Amita Jain","Devendra Kumar Tayal","Oscar Castillo"],"meta":["July 2018"],"references":["315166871_Comparative_Study_of_Image_Thresholding_Using_Type-2_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Cloud_Model","336147767_Experimental_validation_of_a_type-2_fuzzy_logic_controller_for_energy_management_in_hybrid_electrical_vehicles","313762212_Impulse_Noise_Removal_From_Digital_Images_by_a_Detail-Preserving_Filter_Based_on_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic","295679733_SIRMS_based_interval_type-2_fuzzy_inference_systems_Properties_and_application","290024283_A_New_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Controller_for_Unbalance_Problem_of_the_DC-Link_Voltages_of_Five-Level_NPC_Inverter","289960319_Design_of_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set-based_Fuzzy_Neural_Networks_and_Its_Optimization_Using_Generation-based_Evolution","287694066_Stable_indirect_adaptive_type-2_fuzzy_sliding_mode_control_using_lyapunov_approach","287572990_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_Using_SRUKF-Based_State_Estimations_for_Biped_Walking_Robots","279899242_Analog_circuit_fault_diagnosis_under_parameter_variations_based_on_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems","279899105_Robust_adaptive_tracking_control_of_multivariable_nonlinear_systems_based_on_interval_type-2_fuzzy_approach","274744235_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_Based_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_in_Photovoltaic_Systems","272223834_Finishing_mill_thread_speed_set-up_and_control_by_interval_type_1_non-singleton_type_2_fuzzy_logic_systems","279716215_A_bacterial_foraging_optimization_approach_for_tuning_type-2_fuzzy_logic_controller","277538985_Tracking_control_of_surface_vessels_via_fault-tolerant_adaptive_backstepping_interval_type-2_fuzzy_control","274202410_Universal_image_noise_removal_filter_based_on_type-2_fuzzy_logic_system_and_QPSO"]}
