{"id":"21752413_The_Information_Capacity_of_the_Human_Motor_System_in_Controlling_the_Amplitude_of_Movement","abstract":"Reports of 3 experiments testing the hypothesis that the average duration of responses is directly proportional to the minimum average amount of information per response. The results show that the rate of performance is approximately constant over a wide range of movement amplitude and tolerance limits. This supports the thesis that \"the performance capacity of the human motor system plus its associated visual and proprioceptive feedback mechanisms, when measured in information units, is relatively constant over a considerable range of task conditions.\" 25 references.
