{"id":"266986884_On_the_Busy_Period_of_the_Modified_GIG1_Queue","abstract":"Proceeding from duality results for the GI/G/1 queue, this paper obtains the probability of the number served in a busy period of a GI/G/1 system where customers initiating a busy period have a different service time distribution from other customers. Using duality arguments for processes with interchangeable increments, the Laplace transform of the busy period duration is found for a modified GI/M/1 queue.","authors":["Anthony G.
