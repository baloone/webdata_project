{"id":"319247322_Unknotted_Strand_Routings_of_Triangulated_Meshes","abstract":"In molecular self-assembly such as DNA origami, a circular strandâ€™s topological routing determines the feasibility of a design to assemble to a target. In this regard, the Chinese-postman DNA scaffold routings of Benson et al. (2015) only ensure the unknottedness of the scaffold strand for triangulated topological spheres. In this paper, we present a cubic-time \\(\\frac{5}{3}-\\)approximation algorithm to compute unknotted Chinese-postman scaffold routings on triangulated orientable surfaces of higher genus. Our algorithm guarantees every edge is routed at most twice, hence permitting low-packed designs suitable for physiological conditions.","authors":["Abdulmelik Mohammed","Mustafa Hajij"],"meta":["September 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66799-7_4","Conference: International Conference on DNA-Based Computers"],"references":["314797927_DNA_Origami_and_Unknotted_A-trails_in_Torus_Graphs","304005813_Computer-Aided_Production_of_Scaffolded_DNA_Nanostructures_from_Flat_Sheet_Meshes","295088047_Design_principles_for_rapid_folding_of_knotted_DNA_nanostructures","291801654_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns","309215424_Design_tools_for_reporter_strands_and_DNA_origami_scaffold_strands","304005892_Computer-Aided_Production_of_Scaffolded_DNA_Nanostructures_from_Flat_Sheet_Meshes","303560591_Designer_nanoscale_DNA_assemblies_programmed_from_the_top_down","295169929_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_Nanoscale_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","284537429_E2897","280799567_Parametrization_and_smooth_approximation_of_surface_triangulations"]}
