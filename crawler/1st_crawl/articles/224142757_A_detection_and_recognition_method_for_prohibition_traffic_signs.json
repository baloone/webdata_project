{"id":"224142757_A_detection_and_recognition_method_for_prohibition_traffic_signs","abstract":"The automatic detection and recognition of traffic signs have practical importance for intelligent traffic system. A method for some prohibition traffic signs designed for drivers is proposed in this paper. The color information in HSI color space and the symmetry property of circles are used to detect signs, and the Histograms of Oriented Gradients feature and the nearest distance method are used to recognize them. The proposed algorithms are tested on datasets we collected in the real environment, and the experimental results demonstrate their satisfying performance.","authors":["Xu Qingsong","Su Juan","Liu Tiantian"],"meta":["May 2010","DOI:10.1109/IASP.2010.5476048","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Image Analysis and Signal Processing (IASP), 2010 International Conference on"],"references":["3872318_An_active_vision_system_for_on-line_traffic_sign_recognition","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","290002474_Road_Sign_Recognition_A_Study_of_Vision-based_Decision_Making_for_Road_Environment_Recognition","247418662_Road_Signposts_Recognition_System","239438462_Vision-Based_Stop_Sign_Detection_and_Recognition_System_for_Intelligent_Vehicles","222454354_Robust_method_for_road_sign_detection_and_recognition"]}
