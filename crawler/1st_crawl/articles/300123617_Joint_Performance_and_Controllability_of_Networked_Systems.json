{"id":"300123617_Joint_Performance_and_Controllability_of_Networked_Systems","abstract":"Controllability is a basic requirement for control of networked systems. This chapter presents a framework for joint input selection based on joint optimization of performance and controllability. Standard conditions for controllability are discussed, including matrix pencil, controllability Gramian, and graph-theoretic conditions. The main contribution of this chapter is a formulation of controllability conditions as matroid constraints, enabling joint optimization of performance and controllability as a submodular maximization problem with matroid constraints. A graph controllability index is given, which characterizes the largest controllable subgraph of the network, and its submodular structure is proved. Application of this approach to consensus networks is discussed.","authors":["Andrew Clark","Basel Alomair","Linda Bushnell","Radha Poovendran"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26977-1_9","In book: Submodularity in Dynamics and Control of Networked Systems (pp.175-198)"],"references":["273704064_Minimal_Actuator_Placement_with_Optimal_Control_Constraints","266619530_Controllability_and_Fraction_of_Leaders_in_Infinite_Network","261100835_Submodularity_of_Energy_Related_Controllability_Metrics","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","51117462_Controllability_of_complex_networks","51001416_Controllability_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_from_a_Graph-Theoretic_Perspective","280538101_Structural_Minimum_Controllability_Problem_for_Linear_Continuous-Time_Switching_Systems","267189059_Graph_Theoretic_Methods_in_Multi-Agent_Networks","260999266_Control_Profiles_of_Complex_Networks","243092844_Refined_Study_on_Structural_Controllability_of_Descriptor_Systems_by_Means_of_Matroids","239544537_Matrices_and_Matroids_for_Systems_Analysis","220617298_Maximizing_a_Monotone_Submodular_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint","4142645_On_the_controllability_of_nearest_neighbor_interconnections","3029146_On_structural_controllability_theorem","3027079_Structural_Controllability"]}
