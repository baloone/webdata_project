{"id":"332022626_Genetic_alphabets_unitary_matrixes_and_quantum-algorithmic_genetics","abstract":"Unitary operators are the basis of all calculations in quantum computers and play an important role in quantum mechanics. The presented results show that matrix forms of representation of structured DNA and RNA alphabets can be considered as a set of sparse unitary matrices. These results are useful for the development of models of quantum-algorithmic genetics, from the point of view of which living organisms are quantum-information entities.","authors":["Sergey Petoukhov","Elena Petukhova","V Svirin"],"meta":["March 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 489(1):012048","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/489/1/012048"],"references":["325107008_New_Symmetries_and_Fractal-Like_Structures_in_the_Genetic_Coding_System","324799009_Petoukhov's_rules_on_symmetries_in_long_DNA-texts","319875725_The_rules_of_long_DNA-sequences_and_tetra-groups_of_oligonucleotides","312270944_Symmetries_in_Genetic_Systems_and_the_Concept_of_Geno-Logical_Coding","283576401_The_system-resonance_approach_in_modeling_genetic_structures","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition"]}
