{"id":"268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","abstract":"By extending adjacent-endpoint identification in Cantor’s space N({0,1}) to Baire’s N(A), we move from the unit interval I=L({0,1}) to L(A). The metric spaces L(A) n+1 and L(A) ∞ have provided nonseparable analogues of Nöbeling’s and Urysohn’s imbedding theorems. To date, however, L(A) has no metric description. Here, we imbed L(A) in l 2 (A) and the induced metric yields a geometrical interpretation of L(A). Except for the small last section, we are concerned with the imbedding. Once inside l 2 (A), we see L(A) as a subspace of a “closed simplex” Δ A having the standard basis vectors together with the origin as vertices. The part of L(A) in each n-dimensional face σ n of Δ A is a “generalized Sierpiński Triangle” called an n-web ω n . Topologically, ω n is L({0,1,⋯,n}). For n=2, ω 2 is just the usual Sierpiński Triangle in E 2 ; for n=3, ω 3 is Mandelbrot’s fractal skewed web. Thus, L(A)→l 2 (A) invites an extension of fractals. That is, when |A| infinite, Baire’s Space N(A) is a “generalized code space” on |A| symbols that addresses the points of the “generalized fractal” L(A).","authors":["S.L. Lipscomb","J.C.
