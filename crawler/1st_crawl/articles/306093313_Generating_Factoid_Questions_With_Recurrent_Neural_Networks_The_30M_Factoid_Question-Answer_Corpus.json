{"id":"306093313_Generating_Factoid_Questions_With_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_The_30M_Factoid_Question-Answer_Corpus","abstract":"Over the past decade, large-scale supervised learning corpora have enabled machine learning researchers to make substantial advances. However, to this date, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. In this paper we present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question-answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the knowledge base Freebase to transduce facts into natural language questions. The produced question-answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using automatic evaluation metrics, including well-established machine translation and sentence similarity metrics. Across all evaluation criteria the question-generation model outperforms the competing template-based baseline. Furthermore, when presented to human evaluators, the generated questions appear to be indistinguishable from real human-generated questions.","authors":["Iulian Vlad Serban","Alberto García-Durán","Caglar Gulcehre","Sungjin Ahn"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.18653/v1/P16-1056","Conference: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)"],"references":["273640320_LSTM_A_search_space_odyssey","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319770174_Practical_recommendations_for_gradient-based_training_of_deep_architectures","307955489_Distributed_representations_of_words_and_phrases_and_their_compositionality","280081029_Wikidata_A_Free_Collaborative_Knowledgebase","279258225_Translating_Embeddings_for_Modeling_Multi-relational_Data","277959429_Large-scale_Simple_Question_Answering_with_Memory_Networks","277063182_Question_Generation_from_Concept_Maps","270878664_Semantic_Parsing_via_Paraphrasing","267627635_Addressing_the_Rare_Word_Problem_in_Neural_Machine_Translation"]}
