{"id":"324119583_Affective_Communication_through_Air_Jet_Stimulation_Evidence_from_Event-Related_Potentials","abstract":"In this article, effectiveness of air jet stimulation in mediated emotional communication was investigated by assessing cross-modal influences of visual emotional expressions on tactile perception. Brain responses to combined visual faces and air jet stimuli were measured using event-related potentials; whereas, emotional responses were assessed using self-reported pleasantness of the tactile stimulation. ERP results reveal significant differences between the different facial expressions for the same tactile air-jet intensity in the somatosensory area. Moreover, participantsâ€™ pleasantness ratings suggest an effect of the visual stimulus on the difference tactile conditions that correspond to air jet stimulation intensities: low, medium, and high. These promising results provide evidence in the potential efficiency of this stimulation technique in activating skin receptors that play an important role in social and affective behaviors.","authors":["Mohamed Yacine Tsalamlal","Will Rizer","Jean-Claude Martin","Mehdi Ammi"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction 34(8):1-12","DOI:10.1080/10447318.2018.1424065"],"references":["316551483_The_Cutaneous-Rabbit_Illusion_What_if_it_is_not_a_Rabbit","312367462_Feeling_Touched_Emotional_Modulation_of_Somatosensory_Potentials_to_Interpersonal_Touch","286679689_HAIR_HAptic_feedback_with_a_mobile_AIR_jet","273910974_Haptic_communication_of_dimensions_of_emotions_using_air_jet_based_tactile_stimulation","345392789_Affective_Computing","313153203_Distinct_representations_of_eye_gaze_and_identity_in_the_distributed_human_neural_system_for_face_perception","312347894_Effects_of_touch_on_emotional_face_processing_A_study_of_event-related_potentials_facial_EMG_and_cardiac_activity","300589039_MulDiRoH_An_Evaluation_of_Facial_Direction_Expression_in_Teleconferencing_on_a_Multi-view_Display_System","290441884_Multimodal_Action_Recognition","283815864_Haptic_Human-Robot_Affective_Interaction_in_a_Handshaking_Social_Protocol"]}
