{"id":"221080312_Evaluation_of_Pooling_Operations_in_Convolutional_Architectures_for_Object_Recognition","abstract":"A common practice to gain invariant features in object recognition models is to aggregate multiple low-level features over a small neighborhood. However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over nonoverlapping pooling windows. By applying this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57% on the NORB normalized-uniform dataset and 5.6% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset.","authors":["Dominik Scherer","Andreas C MÃ¼ller","Sven Behnke"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15825-4_10","SourceDBLP","Conference: Artificial Neural Networks - ICANN 2010 - 20th International Conference, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 15-18, 2010, Proceedings, Part III"],"references":["224716259_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Invariant_Feature_Hierarchies_with_Applications_to_Object_Recognition","224136091_Large-scale_privacy_protection_in_Google_Street_View","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","243716653_A_hierarchical_model_for_visual_object_recognition","230675350_Receptive_Fields_of_Single_Neurons_in_the_Cat's_Striate_Cortex","227806354_A_neural_network_model_for_the_mechanism_of_selective_attention_in_visual_pattern_recognition","225495886_Efficient_BackProp","222817667_Learning_Generative_Visual_Models_from_Few_Training_Examples_An_Incremental_Bayesian_Approach_Tested_on_101_Object_Categories","221620501_Effiicient_BackProp","221531735_Topological_features_in_locally_connected_RBMs","220860992_Best_Practices_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Visual_Document_Analysis","221620477_3D_Object_Recognition_with_Deep_Belief_Nets","221362706_Multiclass_Object_Recognition_with_Sparse_Localized_Features","221304868_Training_Hierarchical_Feed-Forward_Visual_Recognition_Models_Using_Transfer_Learning_from_Pseudo-Tasks"]}
