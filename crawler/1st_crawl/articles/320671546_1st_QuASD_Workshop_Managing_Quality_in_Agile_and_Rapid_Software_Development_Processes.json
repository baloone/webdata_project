{"id":"320671546_1st_QuASD_Workshop_Managing_Quality_in_Agile_and_Rapid_Software_Development_Processes","abstract":"Optimal management of software quality calls for appropriate integration of quality management activities into the whole software (engineering) life-cycle. However, despite the competitive advantage of ensuring and maintaining high quality levels, software development methodologies still offer little support for the integration and management of quality. This is especially true for, and essential in, agile software development processes and the recent trends towards rapid and continuous software development. The premise is that faster and more frequent release cycles should not compromise quality. This workshop aims to exchange challenges, experiences, and solutions among researchers and practitioners to bring agile and rapid software processes a step further towards seamless integration of quality management activities into their practices.","authors":["Claudia P.
