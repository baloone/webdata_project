{"id":"3299180_Determining_planar_location_via_complement-free_de_Brujin_sequences_using_discrete_optical_sensors","abstract":"We present a technique for determining the absolute x, y-location\nof a robot in a workspace. The floor of the workspace is tiled with\nblack and white squares in a pattern based on a variant of a de Bruijn\nsequence. The black/white pattern on the floor is read by a modest\nnumber of inexpensive, discrete optical sensors, and a simple algorithm\ndetermines the position of the robot","authors":["Edward R.
