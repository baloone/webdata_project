{"id":"224620119_A_multi-resolution_approach_to_extract_the_address_block_on_flatmail_pieces","abstract":"A new approach is presented for dealing with the extraction of\nblock address destination (BAD) on flat mail pieces. It is based on the\nconstruction of a pyramidal data structure which represents the image\nwith a multi-resolution approach, so that much independence is provided\nwith respect to variable parameters such as the size of characters,\nnumber of lines, and handwritten or machine printed. A top-down analysis\nis then performed on the pyramidal structure to interpret the various\nblocks segmented and their relationship between every level of the\npyramid. Results are given in order to demonstrate the performances of\nthis method","authors":["Christian Viard-Gaudin","Dominique Barba"],"meta":["May 1991Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 1988.
