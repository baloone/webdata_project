{"id":"336431157_Safety_Verification_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Reinforcement_Learning_Control","abstract":"This paper proposes a new forward reachability analysis approach to verify safety of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with reinforcement learning controllers. The foundation of our approach lies on two efficient, exact and over-approximate reachability algorithms for neural network control systems using star sets, which is an efficient representation of polyhedra. Using these algorithms, we determine the initial conditions for which a safety-critical system with a neural network controller is safe by incrementally searching a critical initial condition where the safety of the system cannot be established. Our approach produces tight over-approximation error and it is computationally efficient, which allows the application to practical CPS with learning enable components (LECs). We implement our approach in NNV, a recent verification tool for neural networks and neural network control systems, and evaluate its advantages and applicability by verifying safety of a practical Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS) with a reinforcement learning (RL) controller trained using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. The experimental results show that our new reachability algorithms are much less conservative than existing polyhedra-based approaches. We successfully determine the entire region of the initial conditions of the AEBS with the RL controller such that the safety of the system is guaranteed, while a polyhedra-based approach cannot prove the safety properties of the system.","authors":["Dung Hoang Tran","Feiyang Cai","Diego Manzanas Lopez","Patrick Musau"],"meta":["October 2019ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems 18(5s):1-22","DOI:10.1145/3358230"],"references":["335254451_Reachability_Analysis_for_High-Index_Linear_Differential_Algebraic_Equations","331503565_Parallelizable_Reachability_Analysis_Algorithms_for_Feed-Forward_Neural_Networks","330501571_Compositional_Falsification_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Machine_Learning_Components","327084650_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Piecewise_Linear_Systems_with_Neural_Network_Controllers","324245909_Numerical_Verification_of_Affine_Systems_with_up_to_a_Billion_Dimensions","323302444_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Piecewise_Linear_Systems_with_Neural_Network_Controllers","322048764_Reachable_Set_Computation_and_Safety_Verification_for_Neural_Networks_with_ReLU_Activations","301648615_End_to_End_Learning_for_Self-Driving_Cars","283567778_An_Introduction_to_CORA_2015","224715461_Driver_Assisting_by_Inverse_Time_to_Collision","224254106_UAV_Cooperative_Control_with_Stochastic_Risk_Models","221166176_Safe_Exploration_for_Reinforcement_Learning","221042189_Reachability_analysis_of_nonlinear_systems_with_uncertain_parameters_using_conservative_linearization","22149996_A_Theory_of_Visual_Control_of_Braking_Based_on_Information_about_Time-to-Collision","335984493_Star-Based_Reachability_Analysis_of_Deep_Neural_Networks","333566886_Decentralized_Real-Time_Safety_Verification_for_Distributed_Cyber-Physical_Systems","332285412_Verisig_verifying_safety_properties_of_hybrid_systems_with_neural_network_controllers","332285209_Formal_verification_of_neural_network_controlled_autonomous_systems","332278892_Reachability_analysis_for_neural_feedback_systems_using_regressive_polynomial_rule_inference","330589318_Learning-Based_Model_Predictive_Control_for_Safe_Exploration","329039749_Deep_Neural_Network_Compression_for_Aircraft_Collision_Avoidance_Systems","328966451_Reachable_Set_Estimation_and_Verification_for_Neural_Network_Models_of_Nonlinear_Dynamic_Systems","328457601_Simulation-based_Adversarial_Test_Generation_for_Autonomous_Vehicles_with_Machine_Learning_Components","327354048_Learning_and_Verification_of_Feedback_Control_Systems_using_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","321025516_CARLA_An_Open_Urban_Driving_Simulator","318369748_Simulation-Equivalent_Reachability_of_Large_Linear_Systems_with_Inputs","315864986_Compositional_Falsification_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Machine_Learning_Components","311610675_DeepFool_A_Simple_and_Accurate_Method_to_Fool_Deep_Neural_Networks","301361203_A_comprehensive_survey_on_safe_reinforcement_learning","282723724_Reachability-based_safe_learning_with_Gaussian_processes","262167988_Flow_An_Analyzer_for_Non-linear_Hybrid_Systems","262164966_Smart_exploration_in_reinforcement_learning_using_absolute_temporal_difference_errors","260869557_Introduction_to_The_Theory_of_Neural_Computation","258359322_Method_for_Estimating_Time_to_Collision_at_Braking_in_Real-World_Lead_Vehicle_Stopped_Rear-End_Crashes_for_Use_in_Pre-Crash_System_Design","221422108_Reachability_of_Uncertain_Linear_Systems_Using_Zonotopes","51936882_Risk-Sensitive_Reinforcement_Learning_Applied_to_Control_underConstraints"]}
