{"id":"295085576_A_multiple_attribute_interval_type-2_fuzzy_group_decision_making_and_its_application_to_supplier_selection_with_extended_LINMAP_method","abstract":"Supplier selection is a key issue in supply chain management, which directly impacts the manufacturerâ€™s performance. The problem can be viewed as a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) that concerns many conflicting evaluation attributes, both being of qualitative and quantitative nature. Due to the increasing complexity and uncertainty of socio-economic environment, some evaluations of attributes are not adequately represented by numerical assessments and type-1 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we develop some linear programming models with the aid of multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) method to solve interval type-2 fuzzy MAGDM problems, in which the information about attribute weights is incompletely known, and all pairwise comparison judgments over alternatives are represented by IT2FSs. First, we introduce a new distance measure based on the centroid interval between the IT2FSs. Then, we construct the linear programming model to determine the interval type-2 fuzzy positive ideal solution (IT2PIS) and corresponding attributes weight vector. Based on it, an extended LINMAP method to solve MAGDM problem under IT2FSs environment is developed. Finally, a supplier selection example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.","authors":["Jindong Qin","Xinwang Liu","Witold Pedrycz"],"meta":["June 2017Soft Computing 21(12)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-015-2004-y"],"references":["348279772_Group_decision_making_process_for_supplier_selection_with_VIKOR_under_fuzzy_environment","273597211_Frank_Aggregation_Operators_for_Triangular_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set_and_Its_Application_in_Multiple_Attribute_Group_Decision_Making","312622121_A_fuzzy_optimization_model_for_QFD_planning_process_using_analytic_network_approach","299822611_Multi-criteria_decision_making_approaches_for_supplier_evaluation_and_selection_A_literature_review","281980232_A_new_method_for_fuzzy_multiple_attributes_group_decision_making_based_on_interval_type-2_fuzzy_sets_and_the_TOPSIS_method","276276027_A_reasonable_social_welfare_function_Seminar_on_Applications_of_Mathematics_to_the_Social_Sciences","273848282_Fuzzy_linear_programming_approach_to_multiattribute_decision_making_with_multiple_types_of_attribute_values_and_incomplete_weight_information","271637251_Fuzzy_LINMAP_approach_to_heterogeneous_MADM_considering_comparisons_of_alternatives_with_hesitation_degrees","270008390_Multi-attribute_group_decision_making_using_combined_ranking_value_under_interval_type-2_fuzzy_environment","269729641_An_interval_type-2_fuzzy_LINMAP_method_with_approximate_ideal_solutions_for_multiple_criteria_decision_analysis","264006082_Interval_programming_method_for_hesitant_fuzzy_multi-attribute_group_decision_making_with_incomplete_preference_over_alternatives","263575999_A_closeness_coefficient-based_multiple_criteria_decision-making_method_using_interval_type-2_fuzzy_sets_and_its_application_to_watershed_site_selection","260227499_The_collapsing_method_of_defuzzification_for_discretised_interval_type-2_fuzzy_sets","260227408_The_sampling_method_of_defuzzification_for_type-2_fuzzy_sets_Experimental_evaluation","260226931_Defuzzification_of_the_discretised_generalised_type-2_fuzzy_set_Experimental_evaluation"]}
