{"id":"346613028_Increasing_Students'_Responsibility_and_Learning_Outcomes_Using_Partial_Flipped_Classroom_in_a_Language_Processors_Course","abstract":"More than twenty years have passed since the term Flipped Classroom was coined. Despite of the increasing interest in this teaching methodology, fields like Computer Science still need more research in order to judge the impact of this methodology in the learning process. This work presents a comparative study between traditional lectures and a partial application of the Flipped Classroom methodology in the subject Language Processors of a Computer Science degree. The study involved 158 students during two weeks and focused on practical contents of the subject. The results show that students in the Flipped Classroom group were more responsible of their learning process, consequently they got significant better learning outcomes either during or at the end of the learning process. Studentsâ€™ satisfaction was highly positive as well. This work increases the amount of experiments about Flipped Classroom within the field of Computer Science. In addition, this work serves as an example of how to begin the transition from traditional lectures to the Flipped Classroom methodology.","authors":["Jaime Urquiza-Fuentes"],"meta":["November 2020IEEE Access 8:211211","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039628"],"references":["336452763_Supporting_Intensive_Continuous_Assessment_With_BeA_in_a_Flipped_Classroom_Experience","336315090_The_Flipped_Classroom_and_Higher_Education_-_Experiences_with_Computer_Science_Students","328929802_Investigating_Flipped_Classroom_and_Problem-based_Learning_in_a_programming_module_for_computing_conversion_course","323464206_Putting_Flipped_Classroom_into_Practice_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Empirical_Research","317961399_A_Bibliometric_Investigation_of_Flipped_Classroom_Research_during_2000-2015","332404215_Engaging_non-majors_in_MATLAB_programming_through_a_flipped_classroom_approach","328586295_Effects_of_the_flipped_classroom_instructional_strategy_on_students'_learning_outcomes_a_meta-analysis","326754782_The_flipped_classroom_A_review_of_its_advantages_and_challenges","324070065_Evolution_in_Student_Perceptions_of_a_Flipped_Classroom_in_a_Computer_Programming_Course","319908427_Peer_Instruction"]}
