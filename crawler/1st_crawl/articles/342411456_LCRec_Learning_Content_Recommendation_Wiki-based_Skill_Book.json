{"id":"342411456_LCRec_Learning_Content_Recommendation_Wiki-based_Skill_Book","abstract":"Knowledge skills in the ICT-industry always evolve.\nWith the vast variety of jobs available, it is unlikely to\neducate students with skills to fit every job-requirement.\nThis issue inspired us to develop the Learning Content\nRecommender (LCRec) for students to find appropriate\nlearning contents based on required job-skills. In order to\nbridge the required skill for industry and academia, we\nhave to work on IT job-skills and the Computer Science\nCurriculum 2013 (CS2013). Skills from 48 publicly\navailable job searching websites are used to investigate\nwhat the industry needs. We carried out experiments\namong professionals, academics, and students to test the\nusefulness of LCRec, and evaluated the feedbacks.\nLCRec successfully used Knowledge Units from CS2013,\nWikipedia, and essential skills from job hunting websites,\nto benefit entry-level job seekers for finding necessary\nlearning contents to study. It is also convenient for\nacademics to look at the skills needed in industries, and\nto consider enhancing the curriculum with new skills.\nThe study result demonstrated that it is possible to bridge\nthe gap (what learning contents are lacking) between the\nacademia and the industry.","authors":["Chalothon Chootong","Timothy K Shih","Ankhtuya Ochirbat","Worapot Sommool"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Internet Technology 20(6):1753-1766","DOI:10.3966/160792642019102006007","Project: Situ - Situation-Aware Computing (situation dependency, situation transition model, situ-morphism, situation-based testing, dimensional situation analytics, etc.)"],"references":["293099285_Book_Recommendation_Based_on_Book-Loan_Logs","288624982_Exploiting_framenet_for_content-based_book_recommendation","282841112_PLORS_a_personalized_learning_object_recommender_system","328599839_An_Investigation_of_Visual_Fatigue_in_Elementary_School_Students_Resulting_from_Reading_e-books","328598320_The_implementation_of_mobile_technologies_in_higher_education_A_mobile_application_for_university_course_advising","321897520_Data-Driven_Job_Search_Engine_Using_Skills_and_Company_Attribute_Filters","311610181_Book_Recommendation_System_through_content_based_and_collaborative_filtering_method","308189157_Personalised_book_recommendation_system_based_on_opinion_mining_technique","300576731_Book_Recommendation_Based_on_Community_Detection","286571759_Book_recommendation_system_for_digital_library_based_on_user_profiles_by_using_association_rule"]}
