{"id":"266983187_On_two_families_of_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","abstract":"If G is a connected graph, the distance d(u, v) between two vertices u, v âˆˆ V (G) is the length of a shortest path between them. Let W = {w1,w2,.....,wk} be an ordered set of vertices of G and let v be a vertex of G. The representation r(v|W) of v with respect to W is the k-tuple (d(v,w1), d(v, w2), ...., d(v,wk)). If distinct vertices of G have dis-tinct representations with respect to W, then W is called a resolving set or locating set for G. A resolving set of minimum cardinality is called a basis for G and this cardinality is the metric dimension of G, denoted by dim(G). A family G of connected graphs is a family with constant metric dimen-sion if dim(G) does not depend upon the choice of G in G. In this paper, we show that the graphs D*n and Dpn, obtained from prism graph have constant metric dimension.","authors":["Murtaza Ali","M.T.
