{"id":"291421926_Computational_Modeling_Formal_Analysis_and_Tools_for_Systems_Biology","abstract":"As the amount of biological data in the public domain grows, so does the range of modeling and analysis techniques employed in systems biology. In recent years, a number of theoretical computer science developments have enabled modeling methodology to keep pace. The growing interest in systems biology in executable models and their analysis has necessitated the borrowing of terms and methods from computer science, such as formal analysis, model checking, static analysis, and runtime verification. Here, we discuss the most important and exciting computational methods and tools currently available to systems biologists. We believe that a deeper understanding of the concepts and theory highlighted in this review will produce better software practice, improved investigation of complex biological processes, and even new ideas and better feedback into computer science.","authors":["Ezio Bartocci","Pietro Lio"],"meta":["January 2016PLoS Computational Biology 12(1):e1004591","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004591"],"references":["312466587_Timed_Operational_Semantics_and_Well-Formedness_of_Shape_Calculus","328250229_Cellular_Potts_Models_Multiscale_Extensions_and_Biological_Applications","319095281_Cellular_Automaton_Modeling_of_Biological_Pattern_Formation_Characterization_Applications_and_Analysis","312851571_Monitoring_Temporal_Properties_of_Continuous_Signals","312603794_Executable_object_modeling_with_statecharts","305251971_Studying_Emergent_Behaviours_in_Morphogenesis_Using_Signal_Spatio-Temporal_Logic","301972004_dReach_d-Reachability_Analysis_for_Hybrid_Systems","290737627_Data-Driven_Statistical_Learning_of_Temporal_Logic_Properties","290737491_Temporal_Logic_Based_Monitoring_of_Assisted_Ventilation_in_Intensive_Care_Patients","281351175_Automated_symbolic_reachability_analysis_with_application_to_Delta-Notch_signaling_automata"]}
