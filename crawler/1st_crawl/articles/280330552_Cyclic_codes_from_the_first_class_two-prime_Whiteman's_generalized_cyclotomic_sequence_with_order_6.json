In this paper, we compute the autocorrelation\nvalues and linear complexity of the first class two-prime Whiteman's\ngeneralized cyclotomic sequence (WGCS-I) of order $d=6$. Our results show that\nthe autocorrelation values of this sequence is four-valued or five-valued if\n$(n_1-1)(n_2-1)/36$ is even or odd respectively, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are two\ndistinct odd primes and their linear complexity is quite good. We employ the\ntwo-prime WGCS-I of order 6 to construct several classes of cyclic codes over\n$\\mathrm{GF}(q)$ with length $n_1n_2$. We also obtain the lower bounds on the\nminimum distance of these cyclic codes.","authors":["Pramod Kumar Kewat","Priti Kumari"],"meta":["July 2017Cryptography and Communications 9(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-016-0191-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284226492_Autocorrelation_Values_of_New_Generalized_Cyclotomic_Sequences_of_Order_Six_Over_Z_pq","278606688_Generalized_cyclotomic_codes_of_length_p1e1center_dot_center_dot_center_dot_ptet","275218752_The_Bose_and_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Class_of_BCH_Codes","274465805_Autocorrelation_Values_of_Generalized_Cyclotomic_Sequences_of_Order_Six","265371730_Cyclotomy_and_Difference_Sets","261089446_Linear_Complexity_of_Binary_Generalized_Cyclotomic_Sequences_of_Order_6_over_Zpq","258818643_Cyclic_code_from_the_first_class_Whiteman's_generalized_cyclotomic_sequence_with_order_4","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","258233118_A_family_of_difference_sets","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","225609243_Some_Notes_on_Generalized_Cyclotomic_Sequences_of_Length_pq","238594938_Cyclic_Codes_From_the_Two-Prime_Sequences","229066071_Cyclic_Codes_from_Cyclotomic_Sequences_of_Order_Four","223072344_On_the_linear_complexity_of_generalized_cyclotomic_sequences_with_the_period","222607015_New_Generalized_Cyclotomy_and_Its_Applications"]}
