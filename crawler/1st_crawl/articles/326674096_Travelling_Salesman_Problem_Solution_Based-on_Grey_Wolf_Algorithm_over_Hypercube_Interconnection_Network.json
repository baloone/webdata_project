{"id":"326674096_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_Solution_Based-on_Grey_Wolf_Algorithm_over_Hypercube_Interconnection_Network","abstract":"Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most popular NP-complete problems for the researches in the field of computer science which focused on optimization. TSP goal is to find the minimum path between cities with a condition of each city must to visit exactly once by the salesman. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a new swarm intelligent optimization mechanism where it success in solving many optimization problems. In this paper, a parallel version of GWO for solving the TSP problem on a Hypercube Interconnection Network is presented. The algorithm has been compared to the alternative algorithms. Algorithms have been evaluated analytically and by simulations in terms of execution time, optimal cost, parallel runtime, speedup and efficiency. The algorithms are tested on a number of benchmark problems and found parallel Gray wolf algorithm is promising in terms of speed-up, efficiency and quality of solution in comparison with the alternative algorithms.","authors":["Ameen Shaheen","Azzam Sleit","Saleh al-sharaeh"],"meta":["July 2018Modern Applied Science 12(8):142","DOI:10.5539/mas.v12n8p142"],"references":["336995019_A_hybrid_bat_algorithm_to_solve_the_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem","325204485_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_Over_a_Hypercube_Interconnection_Network","325003129_An_improved_chemical_reaction_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_traveling_salesman_problem","323432562_Computer_Hardware_Components_Ontology","320556450_Link_Prediction_Based_on_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","317649369_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Applied_to_the_01_Knapsack_Problem","316455662_Improving_visual_analyses_and_communications_of_ontology_by_dynamic_tree_case_study_computer_system","324055722_Learning_the_Multiple_Traveling_Salesmen_Problem_with_Permutation_Invariant_Pooling_Networks","316799527_Self-Sufficiency_of_an_Autonomous_Reconfigurable_Modular_Robotic_Organism","314797867_Parallel_Implementation_of_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_using_Ant_Colony_Optimization"]}
