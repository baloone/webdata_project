{"id":"343835321_Being_highly_prolific_in_academic_science_characteristics_of_individuals_and_their_departments","abstract":"The prolific (exceptionally high producers of scholarly publications) are strategic to the study of academic science. The highly prolific have been drivers of research activity and impact and are a window into the stratification that exists. For these reasons, we address key characteristics associated with being highly prolific. Doing this, we take a social-organizational approach and use distinctive survey data on both social characteristics of scientists and features of their departments, reported by US faculty in computer science, engineering, and sciences within eight US research universities. The findings point to a telling constellation of hierarchical advantages: rank, collaborative span, and favorable work climate. Notably, once we take rank into account, gender is not associated with being prolific. These findings have implications for understandings of being prolific, systems of stratification, and practices and policies in higher education.","authors":["Mary Frank Fox","Irina Nikivincze"],"meta":["June 2021Higher Education 81(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10734-020-00609-z"],"references":["342258231_Gender_Science_and_Academic_Rank_Key_Issues_and_Approaches","327801187_Changing_European_Academics_A_Comparative_Study_of_Social_Stratification_Work_Patterns_and_Research_Productivity","322745586_High_research_productivity_in_vertically_undifferentiated_higher_education_systems_Who_are_the_top_performers","349806391_Unequal_Higher_Education_Wealth_Status_and_Student_Opportunity","344486804_How_Economics_Shapes_Science","338270320_The_Credential_Society_An_Historical_Sociology_of_Education_and_Stratification","331145027_The_Strength_in_Numbers_The_New_Science_of_Team_Science","328938691_Changing_the_education_of_scholars_An_introduction_to_the_Andrew_W_Mellon_Foundation's_Graduate_Education_Initiative","324998216_Assessing_the_Work_Environment_for_Creativity","322171082_Universities_and_the_Production_of_Elites_Discourses_Policies_and_Strategies_of_Excellence_and_Stratification_in_Higher_Education"]}
