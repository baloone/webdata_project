{"id":"320456274_What's_the_Difference_between_Reliability_and_Resilience","abstract":"The ability to keep the lights on in the event of a cyber-incident is a major concern for the electric sector. Power grid resilience and power grid reliability are both frequently, and often interchangeably, referenced in conversations about keeping the lights on. This begs the question: what is the difference between reliability and resilience? This brief describes the difference between reliability and resilience in relation to cyber-incidents and the power grid.\n\nThis brief appeared in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) March 2016 Newsletter.","authors":["Aaron Clark-Ginsberg"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.20571.46885","Project: Critical infrastructure cybersecurity"],"references":["307810633_Resilience_and_disaster_risk_reduction_an_etymological_journey","284894850_Understanding_and_applying_the_concept_of_community_disaster_resilience_A_capital-based_approach"]}
