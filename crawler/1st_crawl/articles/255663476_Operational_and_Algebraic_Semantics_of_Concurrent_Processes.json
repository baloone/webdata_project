{"id":"255663476_Operational_and_Algebraic_Semantics_of_Concurrent_Processes","abstract":"This chapter presents a particular class of mathematical models for concurrent communicating processes, namely, the class of algebraic calculi. The chapter describes a small language whose constructions reflect simple operational ideas; the meaning of these constructions is presented by means of structured operational semantics. Congruence relation is interpreted as equality of processes. The essence of the congruence is that it is built upon the idea of observing a process, which is taken to mean communicating with it. The idea is that the processes are equal if they are indistinguishable in any experiment based upon observation. Observation equivalence is characterized by a simple modal logic.","authors":["Robin Milner"],"meta":["January 1991","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-88074-1.50024-X"],"references":["225912002_Formal_semantics_of_a_class_of_high-level_primitives_for_coordinating_concurrent_processes","220197726_An_Axiomatic_Proof_Technique_for_Parallel_Programs_I"]}
