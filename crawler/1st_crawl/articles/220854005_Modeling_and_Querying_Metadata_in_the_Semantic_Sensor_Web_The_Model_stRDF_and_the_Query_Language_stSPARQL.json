{"id":"220854005_Modeling_and_Querying_Metadata_in_the_Semantic_Sensor_Web_The_Model_stRDF_and_the_Query_Language_stSPARQL","abstract":"RDF will often be the metadata model of choice in the Se- mantic Sensor Web. However, RDF can only represent thematic meta- data and needs to be extended if we want to model spatial and temporal information. For this purpose, we develop the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extends RDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL for querying stRDF data. In our extension to RDF, we follow the main ideas of constraint databases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifler-free formulas in a flrst-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the beneflts of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be rep- resented in RDF using constraints.","authors":["Manolis Koubarakis","Kostis Kyzirakos"],"meta":["May 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-13486-9_29","SourceDBLP","Conference: The Semantic Web: Research and Applications, 7th Extended Semantic Web Conference, ESWC 2010, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, May 30 - June 3, 2010, Proceedings, Part I"],"references":["234812084_Constraint_query_languages_preliminary_report","225787067_Qualitative_and_topological_relationships_in_spatial_databases","224501992_SemSOS_Semantic_sensor_Observation_Service","318017908_A_Framework_to_Support_Spatial_Temporal_and_Thematic_Analytics_over_Semantic_Web_Data","318017811_Semantic_Sensor_Web","318017809_A_Framework_to_Support_Spatial_Temporal_and_Thematic_Analytics_over_Semantic_Web_Data","256744909_Constraint_Query_Languages","255627637_The_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Ontology_A_Generic_Language_to_DescribeSensor_Assets","234816463_A_constrant-based_spatial_extension_to_SQL","227960649_Supporting_spatial_semantics_with_SPARQL","222531287_On_the_Expressiveness_of_Linear-Constraint_Query_Languages_for_Spatial_Databases","224285663_Allen_JF_Maintaining_Knowledge_About_Temporal_Intervals_Communications_of_the_ACM_26_832-843","222465928_Database_models_for_infinite_and_indefinite_temporal_information","222335714_Building_a_Constraint-Based_Spatial_Database_System_Model_Languages_and_Implementation","221466173_Spatially-Augmented_Knowledgebase"]}
