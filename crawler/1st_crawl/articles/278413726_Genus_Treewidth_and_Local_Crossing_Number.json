{"id":"278413726_Genus_Treewidth_and_Local_Crossing_Number","abstract":"We consider relations between the size, treewidth, and local crossing number\n(maximum crossings per edge) of graphs embedded on topological surfaces. We\nshow that an $n$-vertex graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ with at most\n$k$ crossings per edge has treewidth $O(\\sqrt{gkn})$ and layered treewidth\n$O(gk)$, and that these bounds are tight up to a constant factor. As a special\ncase, the $k$-planar graphs with $n$ vertices have treewidth $O(\\sqrt{kn})$ and\nlayered treewidth $O(k)$, which are tight bounds that improve a previously\nknown $O(k^{3/4}n^{1/2})$ treewidth bound. Additionally, we show that for\n$g<m$, every $m$-edge graph can be embedded on a surface of genus $g$ with\n$O((m/g)\\log^2 g)$ crossings per edge, which is tight to within a\npolylogarithmic factor.","authors":["Vida DujmoviÄ‡","David Eppstein","David R.
