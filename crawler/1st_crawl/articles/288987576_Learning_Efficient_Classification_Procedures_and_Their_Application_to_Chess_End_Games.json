{"id":"288987576_Learning_Efficient_Classification_Procedures_and_Their_Application_to_Chess_End_Games","abstract":"A series of experiments dealing with the discovery of efficient classification procedures from large numbers of examples is described, with a case study from the chess end game king-rook versus king-knight. After an outline of the inductive inference machinery used, the paper reports on trials leading to correct and very fast attribute-based rules for the relations lost 2-ply and lost 3-ply. On another tack, a model of the performance of an idealized induction system is developed and its somewhat surprising predictions compared with observed results. The paper ends with a description of preliminary work on the automatic specification of relevant attributes.","authors":["Ross Quinlan"],"meta":["December 1983","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-12405-5_15","In book: Machine Learning (pp.463-482)"],"references":["313634433_An_experiment_in_automatic_learning_of_diagnostic_rules","292173657_SEMI-AUTONOMOUS_ACQUISITION_OF_PATTERN-BASED_KNOWLEDGE","245281306_An_Analysis_of_Generalization_as_a_Search_Problem","243761731_Discovering_rules_from_large_collections_of_examples_a_case_study","238198020_Automatic_induction_of_classification_rules_for_a_chess_endgame","235076402_Induction_over_Large_Data_Bases","234805873_Inductive_learning_of_relational_productions","234773384_Learning_and_Generalization_of_Characteristic_Descriptions_Evaluation_Criteria_and_Comparative_Review_of_Selected_Methods","232519711_Experiments_in_Induction","224377535_Pattern_recognition_as_rule-guided_inductive_inference_IEEE_Trans_PAMI-2_4_349-361","220814044_Knowledge_Acquisition_from_Structural_Descriptions"]}
