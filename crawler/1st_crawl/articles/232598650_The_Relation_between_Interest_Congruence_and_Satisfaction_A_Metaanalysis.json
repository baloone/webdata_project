{"id":"232598650_The_Relation_between_Interest_Congruence_and_Satisfaction_A_Metaanalysis","abstract":"Performed a meta-analysis of 27 studies reporting a relation between interest congruence and job or academic satisfaction. The overall mean congruence-satisfaction correlation was not significant. An examination of type of congruence measure, gender, Holland type, and academic vs job setting showed no significant moderating effects. Surprisingly, a breakdown by quality of the measurements used in the study indicate that the methodologically weaker studies yielded the strongest satisfaction-congruence relations. Results reinforce the importance of considering occupational fit as more than the match between interests and the occupational environment.
