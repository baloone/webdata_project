{"id":"338934716_Usabilidad_de_un_simulador_para_la_ensenanza_de_la_Programacion_de_Sistemas","abstract":"Simulators, as educational technology tools, facilitate significant learning in students, since they can perform, in a safe and unlimited way, processes or modeled phenomena for their study, meanwhile conditions of execution of the factors can be modified in a controlled manner. Simulators have been used as tools for teaching Computer Science courses, especially to analyze processes inside the computer or between computers, allowing understanding abstract concepts alternatively. In addition, they have served as a platform for the development of practices in computer architecture design or in computer programming with low-level languages. The objective of the present work is to analyze the degree of utility and usability of a simulator, developed by the professor of the course and his students, for teaching systems programming. Usability was measured by two standardized questionnaires applied to students. Results indicate a good acceptance of the simulator used as a teaching tool in subjects related to system programming.","authors":["Enrique Ayala Franco","Víctor Hugo Menéndez Domínguez","Enriqueta Castellanos Bolaños","Luis Fernando Curi Quintal"],"meta":["December 2019","Project: Enseñanza de la ingeniería de software"],"references":["324206212_A_review_of_technology_acceptance_and_adoption_models_and_theories","321940161_Operating_System_Simulator_to_Translate_Assembler_Code_to_Machine_Code","319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","311964494_La_utilizacion_de_los_simuladores_para_la_formacion_de_los_alumnos","299134284_Un_modelo_didactico_basado_en_el_diseno_de_simuladores_el_caso_de_la_matematica_financiera","285811057_SUS_a_retrospective","343975113_Tecnologia_educativa_y_su_papel_en_el_logro_de_los_fines_de_la_educacion","272830039_Quantifying_the_User_Experience_Practical_Statistics_for_User_Research","266497252_La_Simulacion_como_Instrumento_de_Aprendizaje","264090109_Usability_Lessons_Learned_and_Yet_to_Be_Learned","263380317_E-learning_and_the_University_of_Huelva_A_study_of_WebCT_and_the_technological_acceptance_model","259996940_The_Adoption_of_Software_Measures_A_Technology_Acceptance_Model_TAM_Perspective","249313265_Simulation_for_Computer_Sciences_Education","228368593_Determining_What_Individual_SUS_Scores_Mean_Adding_an_Adjective_Rating_Scale","224399055_Designing_Operating_System_Simulator_A_Learning_Tool"]}
