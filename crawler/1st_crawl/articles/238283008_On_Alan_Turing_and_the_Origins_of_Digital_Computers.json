{"id":"238283008_On_Alan_Turing_and_the_Origins_of_Digital_Computers","abstract":"This paper documents an investigation into the role that the late Alan Turing played in the development of electronic computers. Evidence is presented that during the war he was associated with a group that designed and built a series of special purpose electronic computers, which were in at least a limited sense 'program controlled', and that the origins of several post-war general purpose computer projects in Britain can be traced back to these wartime computers.","authors":["Brian Randell"],"meta":["January 1972"],"references":["304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","259795025_The_EDSAC_Electronic_delay_storage_automatic_calculator","258893056_Private_Communication","253170110_The_Use_of_Thyratrons_for_High_Speed_Automatic_Counting_of_Physical_Phenomena","247790299_The_Beginnings_of_Electronic_Computation","247605842_Alan_Mathison_Turing_1912-1954","247585120_Some_future_social_repercussions_of_computers","246740872_Machines_that_play_and_plan","246295381_General_principles_of_the_design_of_all-purpose_computing_machines","235581590_Private_communication_1968"]}
