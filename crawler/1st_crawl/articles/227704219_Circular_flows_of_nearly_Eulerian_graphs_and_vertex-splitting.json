{"id":"227704219_Circular_flows_of_nearly_Eulerian_graphs_and_vertex-splitting","abstract":"The odd edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λo(G), is the size of a smallest odd edge cut of the graph. Let S be any given surface and ϵ be a positive real number. We proved that there is a function fS(ϵ) (depends on the surface S and limϵ→0fS(ϵ)=∞) such that any graph G embedded in S with the odd-edge connectivity at least fS(ϵ) admits a nowhere-zero circular (2+ϵ)-flow. Another major result of the work is a new vertex splitting lemma which maintains the old edge connectivity and graph embedding. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
