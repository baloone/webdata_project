{"id":"273472094_Accuracy_Test_for_Link_Prediction_in_terms_of_Similarity_Index_The_Case_of_WS_and_BA_Models","abstract":"Link prediction is a technique that uses the topological information in a\ngiven network to infer the missing links in it. Since past research on link\nprediction has primarily focused on enhancing performance for given empirical\nsystems, negligible attention has been devoted to link prediction with regard\nto network models. In this paper, we thus apply link prediction to two network\nmodels: The Watts-Strogatz (WS) model and Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA) model. We\nattempt to gain a better understanding of the relation between accuracy and\neach network parameter (mean degree, the number of nodes and the rewiring\nprobability in the WS model) through network models. Six similarity indices are\nused, with precision and area under the ROC curve (AUC) value as the accuracy\nmetrics. We observe a positive correlation between mean degree and accuracy,\nand size independence of the AUC value.","authors":["Min-Woo Ahn","Woo-Sung Jung"],"meta":["March 2015Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 429","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2015.01.083","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260282976_Diameter_of_the_World-Wide_Web","222511520_Introduction_to_ROC_analysis","221654073_Human_mobility_social_ties_and_link_prediction","221559387_The_Web_as_a_Graph","46462363_Hierarchical_Structure_in_Financial_Markets","12290611_The_Large-Scale_Organization_of_Metabolic_Networks","12265314_The_Small_World_of_Metabolism","11380883_Specificity_and_Stability_in_Topology_of_Protein_Networks","8894104_Self-similar_community_structure_in_a_network_of_human_interactions","6371774_Structure_and_Tie_Strengths_in_Mobile_Communication_Networks","285047000_Discovering_missing_links_in_Wikipedia","253665724_Hierarchical_structure_in_financial_markets","228058047_Graph_Structure_in_the_Web","227588355_Predicting_Missing_Links_via_Local_Information","222557188_The_topology_of_the_transcription_regulatory_network_in_the_yeast_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","222546212_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaborations_Physica_A_Statistical_Mechanics_and_its_Applications_3113_590-614","222490499_Mean-Field_Theory_for_Scale-Free_Random_Networks","222401825_Friends_and_Neighbors_on_the_Web","220923912_Recommendation_as_link_prediction_A_graph_kernel-based_machine_learning_approach","220923878_Link_prediction_approach_to_collaborative_filtering","220432611_Link_Prediction_in_Citation_Networks","200110869_Discovering_missing_links_in_Wikipedia","47326911_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks_A_Survey","45626635_Link_Prediction_Based_on_Local_Random_Walk","40696069_Missing_and_spurious_interactions_and_the_reconstruction_of_complex_networks","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","11846504_Random_Graphs_with_Arbitrary_Degree_Distributions_and_their_Applications","11846481_Newman_MEJ_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks_Phys_Rev_E_64_025102","5400591_Hierarchical_structure_and_the_prediction_of_missing_links_in_networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks","2558295_SimRank_A_Measure_of_Structural-Context_Similarity"]}
