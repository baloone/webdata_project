{"id":"225986157_Algorithms_for_Dominating_Set_in_Disk_Graphs_Breaking_the_logn_Barrier","abstract":"We consider the problem of finding a lowest cost dominating set in a given disk graph containing n disks. The problem has been extensively studied on subclasses of disk graphs, yet the best known approximation for disk graphs\nhas remained O(logn) – a bound that is asymptotically no better than the general case. We improve the status quo in two ways: for the unweighted\ncase, we show how to obtain a PTAS using the framework recently proposed (independently) by Mustafa and Ray [16] and by Chan\nand Har-Peled [4]; for the weighted case where each input disk has an associated rational weight with the objective of finding\na minimum cost dominating set, we give a randomized algorithm that obtains a dominating set whose weight is within a factor\n2O(log* n)2^{O(\\log^* n)} of a minimum cost solution, with high probability – the technique follows the framework proposed recently by Varadarajan\n[19].","authors":["Matt Gibson","Imran A.
