{"id":"341957673_Color_image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_double_random_encryption_strategy","abstract":"Based on compressive sensing and double random encryption strategy, a novel color image compression and encryption scheme is proposed in this paper. The architecture of compression, confusion and diffusion is adopted. Firstly, the red, green and blue components of color plain image are converted to three sparse coefficient matrices by discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then a double random position permutation (DRPP) is introduced to confuse the coefficient matrices. Subsequently, Logistic-Tent system is utilized to generate the asymptotic deterministic random measurement matrix based on chaotic system and plain image (ADMMCP), which is used to measure the coefficient matrices to obtain measurement value matrices. Moreover, simultaneous double random pixel diffusion between inter-intra components (SDRDIC) is presented to modify the elements of measurement value matrices to obtain the final cipher image. A 4-D hyperchaotic system is applied to produce chaotic sequences for confusion and diffusion, the initial conditions of the used chaotic systems are controlled by the SHA 512 hash value of plain image and external keys, such that the proposed image cryptosystem may withstand known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks. Experimental results and security analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed cipher.","authors":["Xiuli Chai","Jianqiang Bi","Zhihua Gan","Xianxing Liu"],"meta":["June 2020Signal Processing 176:107684","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2020.107684"],"references":["335468174_Exponential_Chaotic_Model_for_Generating_Robust_Chaos","333990565_Exploiting_plaintext-related_mechanism_for_secure_color_image_encryption","330078270_Image_Encryption_Using_Josephus_Problem_and_Filtering_Diffusion","329294977_An_efficient_chaos-based_image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_using_block_compressive_sensing_and_elementary_cellular_automata","328173883_A_novel_bit-level_color_image_encryption_using_improved_1D_chaotic_map","327663837_Cryptanalysis_and_Improvement_on_an_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Design_Using_a_Novel_Chaos_Based_S-Box","325299293_A_chaotic_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_3-D_bit-plane_permutation","324106366_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing","323925540_Image_encryption_based_on_modified_Henon_map_using_hybrid_chaotic_shift_transform","313124621_A_fast_and_efficient_approach_to_color-image_encryption_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_fractional_Fourier_transform","308339401_An_innovative_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_chaotic_map_and_Vigenere_scheme","277640427_A_New_Color_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Using_CML_and_a_Fractional-Order_Chaotic_System","345648723_Double-image_compression_and_encryption_algorithm_based_on_co-sparse_representation_and_random_pixel_exchanging","338706061_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_conservative_hyperchaotic_system_and_closed-loop_diffusion_between_blocks","338302691_An_efficient_visually_meaningful_image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_dynamic_LSB_embedding","336184244_When_an_attacker_meets_a_cipher-image_in_2018_A_year_in_review","336181028_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_hyperchaotic_map","334140462_An_image_compression_and_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing","332121357_Chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_with_orbit_perturbation_and_dynamic_state_variable_selection_mechanisms","324055616_Cryptanalysis_of_a_Chaotic_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Information_Entropy","321123162_Improved_known-plaintext_attack_to_permutation-only_multimedia_ciphers","320994855_Cryptanalysis_and_Enhancements_of_Image_Encryption_Using_Combination_of_the_1D_Chaotic_Map","318896379_Crypt_analysis_of_an_image_compression-encryption_algorithm_and_a_modified_scheme_using_compressive_sensing","314489687_A_new_color_image_encryption_using_combination_of_the_1D_chaotic_map","312875654_An_image_coding_scheme_using_parallel_compressive_sensing_for_simultaneous_compression-encryption_applications","310780662_A_visually_secure_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_compressive_sensing","305658244_Hopf_bifurcation_analysis_and_ultimate_bound_estimation_of_a_new_4-D_quadratic_autonomous_hyper-chaotic_system","279754478_Image_encryption_based_on_three-dimensional_bit_matrix_permutation","277784291_Double-image_encryption_scheme_combining_DWT-based_compressive_sensing_with_discrete_fractional_random_transform","273483497_Asymmetric_color_image_encryption_scheme_using_2D_discrete-time_map","272028181_Image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_based_on_2D_compressive_sensing_and_fractional_Mellin_transform","265415448_A_new_chaotic_map_based_image_encryption_schemes_for_several_image_formats","265386722_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos_maps_with_Markov_properties","261290410_Novel_image_compression-encryption_hybrid_algorithm_based_on_key-controlled_measurement_matrix_in_compressive_sensing","257585094_A_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_and_chaotic_function_model_for_image_encryption","256821419_Digital_image_information_encryption_based_on_Compressive_Sensing_and_double_random-phase_encoding_technique","251513506_The_novel_bilateral_-_Diffusion_image_encryption_algorithm_with_dynamical_compound_chaos","241075313_A_novel_chaos-based_image_encryption_scheme_with_an_efficient_permutation-diffusion_mechanism","231092988_Digital_image_encryption_with_chaotic_map_lattices","224667824_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_Recursive_Function_Approximation_with_Applications_to_Wavelet_Decomposition","222374668_A_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_with_variable_control_parameters","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","3085640_Decoding_by_Linear_Programming","1913986_Subspace_Pursuit_for_Compressive_Sensing_Signal_Reconstruction"]}
