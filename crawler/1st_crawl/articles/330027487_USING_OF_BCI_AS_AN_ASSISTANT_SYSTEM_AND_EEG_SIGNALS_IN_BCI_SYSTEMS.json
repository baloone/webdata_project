One of the most interesting anatomical parts of human beings is undoubtedly the brain. Today's studies show progress in various areas by monitoring the neural activity of the brain. One of the most common methods for monitoring brain signals is known as EEG (Electroencephalogram). Today, EEG is used as an adjunct to medical diagnosis and treatment, and is also used in interdisciplinary computer science systems in BCI (Brain Computer Interface) systems.Brain Computer Interface(BCI) systems are based on the use of individual brain signals and the proper use of the individual to communicate with the outside world. Usage areas of BCI systems; partial motor movement loss, severe paralyzed individuals, severe speech difficulties and so on. can be listed as.In this study, the current point of BCI system design is compiled. In this way, the status of BCI system studies can be monitored and the direction of developments in the BCI field can be seen. \n\n(PDF) USING OF BCI AS AN ASSISTANT SYSTEM AND EEG SIGNALS IN BCI SYSTEMS.
