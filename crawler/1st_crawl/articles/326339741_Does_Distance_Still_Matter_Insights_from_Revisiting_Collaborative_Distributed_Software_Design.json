{"id":"326339741_Does_Distance_Still_Matter_Insights_from_Revisiting_Collaborative_Distributed_Software_Design","abstract":"Global Software Engineering requires supporting distributed collaboration for the majority of software development activities. However, geographic distance challenges effective collaboration. Nowadays, we witness significant advances in communication and collaboration technologies. We, thus, explore whether these advances enable effective remote collaboration. To this end, we studied the design activities of both co-located and distributed professional software designers. Based on our observations, we report findings based on analysis of video recordings of design sessions and questionnaires. Ultimately, we found that despite comprehensive technological improvements, distance still matters. We suggest that extra (non-technical) details have to be considered in order to ensure effective distributed software design.","authors":["Rodi Jolak","Andreas Wortmann","Michel R. V.
