{"id":"325322435_Workspace_optimization_of_a_class_of_zero-torsion_parallel_wrists","abstract":"We present singularity-free workspace optimization of a class of two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) parallel wrists with large rotation range capability. The wrists in consideration are kinematically equivalent to two families of 2-DoF homokinetic couplings. The first family comprises fully parallel wrists with N ( N â‰¥ 3) double-universal ( $\\mathcal{UU}$ ) legs. The second family comprises spherical N - $\\mathcal{UU}$ parallel wrists with interconnecting revolute ( $\\mathcal{R}$ ) joints. Both families belong to the more general class of zero-torsion parallel manipulators, and are, therefore, collectively referred to as zero-torsion wrists (ZTWs). We carry out a unified singularity-free workspace optimization by utilizing geometric properties of zero-torsion motion manifolds. Our work may serve as a conceptual guide to the design of ZTWs for large tilt-angle applications.","authors":["Yuanqing Wu","Marco Carricato"],"meta":["May 2018Robotica 37(7):1-16","DOI:10.1017/S0263574718000413"],"references":["318928787_Synthesis_and_Singularity_Analysis_of_N_-_U_U_Parallel_Wrists_A_Symmetric_Space_Approach","318727027_Design_of_a_Novel_3-DoF_Serial-Parallel_Robotic_Wrist_A_Symmetric_Space_Approach","298723641_Inversion_Symmetry_of_the_Euclidean_Group_Theory_and_Application_to_Robot_Kinematics","281730987_Reconfiguration_Analysis_of_a_2-DOF_3-4R_Parallel_Manipulator_with_Planar_Base_and_Platform","258846558_Jacobian_Manipulability_Condition_Number_and_Accuracy_of_Parallel_Robots","319770298_A_Mathematical_Introduction_to_Robotic_Manipulation","275423473_Constant-Velocity_Shaft_Couplings_A_General_Theory","271502752_New_high-angulation_omni-directional_sensor_mount","270740776_Decoupled_and_Homokinetic_Transmission_of_Rotational_Motion_via_Constant-Velocity_Joints_in_Closed-Chain_Orientational_Manipulators","261352900_Cartesian_stiffness_evaluation_of_a_novel_2_DoF_parallel_wrist_under_redundant_and_antagonistic_actuation","257132709_Numerical_Computation_of_Manipulator_Singularities","245367110_Accuracy_Analysis_of_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Joint_Clearance","245366625_Type_Synthesis_of_3DOF_Translational_Parallel_Manipulators_Based_on_Screw_Theory","245366542_A_New_Technique_for_Clearance_Influence_Analysis_in_Spatial_Mechanisms","245366524_Type_Synthesis_of_3DOF_Spherical_Parallel_Manipulators_Based_on_Screw_Theory"]}
