{"id":"286764893_Human-level_concept_learning_through_probabilistic_program_induction","abstract":"People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms\ntypically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer\nways than conventional algorithms—for action, imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures\nthese human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world’s alphabets.\nThe model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging\none-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.\nWe also present several “visual Turing tests” probing the model’s creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are\nindistinguishable from human behavior.","authors":["Brenden M Lake","Ruslan Salakhutdinov","Joshua B Tenenbaum"],"meta":["December 2015Science 350(6266):1332-1338","DOI:10.1126/science.aab3050"],"references":["277411157_Deep_Learning","236068471_Evaluating_Amazon's_Mechanical_Turk_as_a_Tool_for_Experimental_Behavioral_Research","233806263_A_Large-Scale_Model_of_the_Functioning_Brain","220499843_Neural_Networks_and_the_BiasVariance_Dilemma","49764238_Learning_a_Theory_of_Causality","41224953_A_Stochastic_Grammar_of_Images","26779781_Structure_learning_in_action","26716044_When_writing_impairs_reading_Letter_Perception's_Susceptibility_to_Motor_Interference","19790930_Perception_of_Dynamic_Information_in_Static_Handwritten_Forms","13429299_Referential_Communication_and_Category_Acquisition","11470186_Object_name_Learning_Provides_On-the-Job_Training_for_Attention","6868353_Letter_processing_automatically_recruits_a_sensory-motor_brain_network","6330774_Word_Learning_as_Bayesian_Inference","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","280937892_Categorization_in_3-_and_4-Month-Old_Infants_An_Advantage_of_Words_Over_Tones","277410990_Probabilistic_machine_learning_and_artificial_intelligence","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","272422583_DRAW_A_Recurrent_Neural_Network_For_Image_Generation","247662081_Structured_Imagination_The_Role_of_Category_Structure_in_Exemplar_Generation","243726347_The_importance_of_shape_in_early_lexical_learning","240308783_Learning_with_Hierarchical-Deep_Models","234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable","232737859_A_probabilistic_account_of_exemplar_and_category_generation","222446575_On_the_Adequacy_of_Prototype_Theory_as_a_Theory_of_Concepts","222033311_The_grammar_of_action_Sequence_and_syntax_in_children's_copying","221784388_Bootstrapping_in_a_language_of_thought_A_formal_model_of_numerical_concept_learning","220600027_Stroke_segmentation_by_bernstein-bezier_curve_fitting","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition","51185972_A_Rational_Analysis_of_Rule-Based_Concept_Learning","51119047_The_Role_of_Explanation_in_Discovery_and_Generalization_Evidence_From_Category_Learning","45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models","38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","19585510_Recognition-by-Components_A_Theory_of_Human_Image_Understanding","16653471_Parts_Of_Recognition","16575657_Ad_hoc_categories","13981747_The_Structure_of_Perceptual_Categories","10588346_Visual_presentation_of_single_letters_activates_a_premotor_area_involved_in_writing","6383769_Learning_Overhypotheses_with_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Models","5723948_The_formation_of_learning_sets","5598858_Vapnik_VN_An_overview_of_statistical_learning_theory_IEEE_Trans_Neural_Netw_10_988-999","3193029_Identification_of_Fork_Points_on_the_Skeletons_of_Handwritten_Chinese_Characters","3192559_Using_generative_models_for_handwritten_digit_recognition","3192056_Thinning_Methodologies-A_Comprehensive_Survey"]}
