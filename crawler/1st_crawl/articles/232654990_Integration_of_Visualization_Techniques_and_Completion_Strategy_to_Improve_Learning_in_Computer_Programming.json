{"id":"232654990_Integration_of_Visualization_Techniques_and_Completion_Strategy_to_Improve_Learning_in_Computer_Programming","abstract":"Computer Programming is known as a difficult subject that requires complex cognitive task by the majority of students even for those who are taking Computer Science courses. It is normal for programming instructors to provide their students with alternative methods to help them in the learning process. When learning to program for the first time, students and lecturers usually are facing with difficulties in learning and teaching the subject. Mobile learning provides a great opportunity for learners to switch from rigid learning to fun learning using supported elements. The ability of mobile devices only is still not enough for learners to master in learning programming without the right options in techniques applied. This study will explore how Visualization Technique and Completion Strategy can be used to improve learning in a computer programming subject.","authors":["Nurhana Hashim","Sazilah Salam"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.131","Project: The Development & Evaluation of Mobile Learning Object to facilitate The Preparatory Phase"],"references":["312990037_Strategies_for_programming_instruction_in_high_school_Program_completion_vs_Program_generation","221538551_Learning_styles_and_performance_in_an_introductory_programming_sequence","220420778_Novice_Programming_Comes_of_Age","31597406_A_Survey_of_Literature_on_the_Teaching_of_Introductory_Programming","3889396_Learning_programming_using_program_visualization_techniques","3050610_A_programming_learning_system_for_beginners-A_completion_strategy_approach","320655650_COLORS_for_Programming_A_System_to_Support_the_Learning_of_Programming","284971556_Multimedia_learning_and_games","250144750_Strategies_for_Programming_Instruction_in_High_School_Program_Completion_vs_Program_Generation","242450745_The_open_mind_exploring_the_six_patterns_of_natural_intelligence","229439580_Measuring_Hierarchical_Levels_of_Programming_Knowledge","222408779_A_Meta-Study_of_Algorithm_Visualization_Effectiveness","221096911_Multimedia_the_Effect_of_Picture_Voice_Text_for_the_Learning_of_Concepts_and_Principles","220707052_Constructivist_approaches_for_teaching_computer_programming","220675700_Programming_Anxiety_Amongst_Computing_Students_-_A_Key_in_the_Retention_Debate","31845630_Creating_Graphics_for_Learning_and_Performance_Lessons_in_Visual_Literacy_LL_Lohr","27297401_Novice_Programming_Comes_of_Age","7378576_When_Static_Media_Promote_Active_Learning_Annotated_Illustrations_Versus_Narrated_Animations_in_Multimedia_Instruction","4029158_The_Mobile-based_learning_MBL_in_Japan"]}
