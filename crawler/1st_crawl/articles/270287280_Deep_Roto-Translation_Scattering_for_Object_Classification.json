{"id":"270287280_Deep_Roto-Translation_Scattering_for_Object_Classification","abstract":"Dictionary learning algorithms or supervised deep convolution networks have\nconsiderably improved the efficiency of predefined feature representations such\nas SIFT. We introduce a deep scattering convolution network, with predefined\nwavelet filters over spatial and angular variables. This representation brings\nan important improvement to results previously obtained with predefined\nfeatures over object image databases such as Caltech and CIFAR. The resulting\naccuracy is comparable to results obtained with unsupervised deep learning and\ndictionary based representations. This shows that refining image\nrepresentations by using geometric priors is a promising direction to improve\nimage classification and its understanding.","authors":["Edouard Oyallon","St√©phane Georges Mallat"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298904","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","316588757_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","303606103_Discovering_objects_and_their_location_in_images","287920236_Cardinal_sparse_partial_least_square_feature_selection_and_its_application_in_face_recognition","287273202_Stable_and_efficient_representation_learning_with_nonnegativity_constraints","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","269250222_Learning_Smooth_Pooling_Regions_for_Visual_Recognition"]}
