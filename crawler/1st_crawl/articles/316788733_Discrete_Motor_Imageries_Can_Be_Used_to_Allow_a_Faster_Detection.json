{"id":"316788733_Discrete_Motor_Imageries_Can_Be_Used_to_Allow_a_Faster_Detection","abstract":"Motor imagery (MI) modulates the neural activity within the primary sensorimotor areas of the cortex and can be observed through the analysis of electroen-cephalographic (EEG) recordings. It is particularly interesting for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. In most MI-based BCI experimental paradigms, subjects realize continuous motor imagery (CMI), i.e. a repetitive and prolonged intention of movement, for a few seconds. The system detects the movement based on the event-related desynchronization and the event-related synchronization features in electroencephalographic signal. Currently , improving efficiency such as detecting faster a motor imagery is an important issue in BCI to avoid fatigue and boredom. The purpose of this study is to show the difference, in term of classification, between a discrete motor imagery, i.e. a single short MI, and a CMI. The results of experiments involving 16 healthy subjects show that a BCI based on DMI is as effective as a BCI based on CMI and could be used to allow a faster detection.","authors":["SÃ©bastien Rimbert","Oleksii Avilov","Laurent Bougrain"],"meta":["April 2017","Conference: 7th Graz Brain-Computer Interface Conference 2017"],"references":["293798780_Decoding_motor_responses_from_the_EEG_during_altered_states_of_consciousness_induced_by_propofol","265095148_Motor_Imagery_for_Severely_Motor-Impaired_Patients_Evidence_for_Brain-Computer_Interfacing_as_Superior_Control_Solution","235387540_Investigating_brief_motor_imagery_for_an_ERDERS_based_BCI","231612627_The_ups_and_downs_of_b_oscillations_in_sensorimotor_cortex","225165987_Issues_in_the_application_of_the_average_reference_Review_critiques_and_recommendations","303178194_Declaration_of_Helsinki_Ethical_principles_for_medical_research_involving_human_subjects","293107576_Direct_brain-computer_communication","292547642_Brain-Computer_Interfaces_Principles_and_Practice","285833494_Event-related_EEG-MEG_synchronization_and_desynchronization_Basic_principles","272094793_Performance_Variation_in_Motor_Imagery_Brain-Computer_Interface_A_Brief_Review"]}
