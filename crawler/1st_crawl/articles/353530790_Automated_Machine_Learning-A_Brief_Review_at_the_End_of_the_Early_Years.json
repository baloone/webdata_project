{"id":"353530790_Automated_Machine_Learning-A_Brief_Review_at_the_End_of_the_Early_Years","abstract":"Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the sub-field of machine learning that aims at automating, to some extend, all stages of the design of a machine learning system. In the context of supervised learning, AutoML is concerned with feature extraction, preprocessing, model design, and post processing. Major contributions and achievements in AutoML have been taking place during the recent decade. We are, therefore, in perfect timing to look back and realize what we have learned. This chapter aims to summarize the main findings in the early years of AutoML. More specifically, in this chapter an introduction to AutoML for supervised learning is provided and a historical review of progress in this field is presented. Likewise, the main paradigms of AutoML are described and research opportunities are outlined.","authors":["Hugo Jair Escalante"],"meta":["July 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-72069-8_2","In book: Automated Design of Machine Learning and Search Algorithms (pp.11-28)"],"references":["351819201_A_Comprehensive_Survey_of_Neural_Architecture_Search_Challenges_and_Solutions","341038136_Towards_Automated_Computer_Vision_Analysis_of_the_AutoCV_Challenges_2019","349912363_Automated_Design_of_Deep_Neural_Networks_A_Survey_and_Unified_Taxonomy","347624256_AutoML_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art","338681645_Automated_Machine_Learning_-_Methods_Systems_Challenges","338681644_Neural_Architecture_Search_A_Survey","337653933_AutoML_NeurIPS_2018_Challenge_Design_and_Results","337653836_Automatically_Optimized_Gradient_Boosting_Trees_for_Classifying_Large_Volume_High_Cardinality_Data_Streams_Under_Concept_Drift","336823244_Meta-learning_of_Text_Classification_Tasks","335577780_Towards_Automated_Semi-Supervised_Learning"]}
