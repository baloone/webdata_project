{"id":"226908041_Nanotechnology_and_the_public_Effectively_communicating_nanoscale_science_and_engineering_concepts","abstract":"Researchers are faced with challenges when addressing the public on concepts and applications associated with nanotechnology.\nThe goal of our work was to understand the publicâ€™s knowledge of nanotechnology in order to identify appropriate starting\npoints for dialog. Survey results showed that people lack true understanding of concepts associated with atoms and the size\nof the nanoscale regime. Such gaps in understanding lead to a disappointing lack of communication between researchers and\nthe public concerning fundamental concepts in nanoscale science and engineering. Strategies are offered on how scientists\nshould present their research when engaging the public on nanotechnology topics.","authors":["O. M. Castellini","Gina Walejko","C. E. Holladay","T. J.
