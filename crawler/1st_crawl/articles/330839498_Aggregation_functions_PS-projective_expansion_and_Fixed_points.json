{"id":"330839498_Aggregation_functions_PS-projective_expansion_and_Fixed_points","abstract":"Borsik and Dobo≈°[2] investigated the problem of aggregation for metric spaces in 1981. After that, motivated by the application of partial metric spaces to computer science presented by Matthews[9]; Massanet and Valero[8] studied the aggregation problem in the framework of partial metric spaces in 2012. Recently, Alghamdi et al.[1] defined the new notion of contraction between partial metric spaces through aggregation perspective with more suitable aggregation properties and studied the existence and uniqueness of fixed point. On the other hand, very recently, Karapinar et al.[7] presented a generalized version of metric spaces called quasi partial metric spaces by removing the symmetric axiom. This paper presents some fixed point results in the setting of quasi partial metric spaces using expansive mappings. Furthermore, we introduce expansion between quasi partial metric spaces via aggregation.","authors":["Pooja Dhawan","Jatinderdeep Kaur","Vishnu Narayan Mishra"],"meta":["February 2019"],"references":["265831582_Some_theorems_on_expansion_mappings_and_their_fixed_points","265544054_On_a_product_of_metric_spaces","257877999_Fixed_point_theorems_for_-expansive_mappings_in_complete_metric_spaces","266312683_An_expansion_mapping_theorem","261834717_New_results_on_metric_aggregation","247584870_Some_fixed_point_theorems_on_expansion_mappings","246200885_Fixed_points_for_expansion_mappings","236343637_Fixed_point_theorems_on_quasi-partial_metric_spaces","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology"]}
