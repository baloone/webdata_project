Using a network composed of two interacting populations, detailed stochastic and non-linear analysis demonstrates that increasing the intensity of iid additive noise induces a phase transition from a spectrally broad-band state to a phase-coherent oscillatory state. Corresponding coherence resonance-like system behavior is described analytically for iid noise as well. Stochastic transitions and coherence resonance-like behavior were also found to occur for non-iid additive noise induced by increased heterogeneity, corresponding analytical results complement the analysis. Finally, the results are applied to burst suppression-like patterns observed in electroencephalographic data under anesthesia, providing strong evidence that these patterns reflect jumps between random and phase-coherent neural states induced by varying external additive noise levels.","authors":["Axel Hutt","Jérémie Lefebvre","Darren Hight","Heiko A Kaiser"],"meta":["December 2019Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics 5","DOI:10.3389/fams.2019.00069"],"references":["322779997_Landau-Ginzburg_theory_of_cortex_dynamics_Scale-free_avalanches_emerge_at_the_edge_of_synchronization","322087933_Stochastic_resonance_mediates_the_state-dependent_effect_of_periodic_stimulation_on_cortical_alpha_oscillations","306108795_Dynamic_Control_of_Synchronous_Activity_in_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons","301232981_Stochastic_resonance_and_the_benefits_of_noise_From_ice_ages_to_crayfish_and_SQUIDs","301232568_Shaping_Intrinsic_Neural_Oscillations_with_Periodic_Stimulation","325836795_Suppression_of_underlying_neuronal_fluctuations_mediates_EEG_slowing_during_general_anaesthesia","324235051_Scale-freeness_or_partial_synchronization_in_neural_mass_phase_oscillator_networks_Pick_one_of_two","321517144_Noise_in_Spatially_Extended_Systems","301838210_Additive_noise_destroys_the_random_attractor_close_to_bifurcation","301232898_Dynamics_of_networks_of_randomly_connected_excitatory_and_inhibitory_spiking_neurons"]}
