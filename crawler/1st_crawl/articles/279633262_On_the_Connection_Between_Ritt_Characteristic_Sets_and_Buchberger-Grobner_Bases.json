{"id":"279633262_On_the_Connection_Between_Ritt_Characteristic_Sets_and_Buchberger-Grobner_Bases","abstract":"For any polynomial ideal $I$, let the minimal triangular set contained in the\nreduced Buchberger-Gr\\\"obner basis of $I$ with respect to the purely\nlexicographical term order be called the W-characteristic set of $I$. In this\npaper, we establish a strong connection between Ritt's characteristic sets and\nBuchberger's Gr\\\"obner bases of polynomial ideals by showing that the\nW-characteristic set $C$ of $I$ is a Ritt characteristic set of $I$ whenever\n$C$ is an ascending set, and a Ritt characteristic set of $I$ can always be\ncomputed from $C$ with simple pseudo-division when $C$ is regular. We also\nprove that under certain variable ordering, either the W-characteristic set of\n$I$ is normal, or irregularity occurs for the $j$th, but not the $(j+1)$th,\nelimination ideal of $I$ for some $j$. In the latter case, we provide explicit\npseudo-divisibility relations, which lead to nontrivial factorizations of\ncertain polynomials in the Buchberger-Gr\\\"obner basis and thus reveal the\nstructure of such polynomials. The pseudo-divisibility relations may be used to\ndevise an algorithm to decompose arbitrary polynomial sets into normal\ntriangular sets based on Buchberger-Gr\\\"obner bases computation.","authors":["Dongming Wang"],"meta":["December 2016Mathematics in Computer Science 10(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11786-016-0279-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324407379_Differential_Algebra","324312842_Ideals_Varieties_and_Algorithms","321526426_Algorithmic_Algebra","321509055_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","268311510_Elimination_Methods","265434546_Combinatorial_Commutative_Algebra","246337114_Grlouobner_bases_An_algorithmic_method_in_polynomial_ideal_theory","242570785_Grsbner_bases_-_a_computational_approach_to_commutative_algebra","242505554_Commutative_Algebra_with_a_View_Toward_Algebraic_Geometry","237129304_Basic_principles_of_mechanical_theorem_proving_in_geometries","210231851_Grobner_Bases_An_Algorithmic_Method_in_Polynomial_Ideal_Theory","222738684_Solving_zero-dimensional_algebraic_systems","222467774_On_the_Theories_of_Triangular_Sets","200018953_Differential_Equations_from_the_Algebraic_Standpoint","200018952_Differential_Algebra"]}
