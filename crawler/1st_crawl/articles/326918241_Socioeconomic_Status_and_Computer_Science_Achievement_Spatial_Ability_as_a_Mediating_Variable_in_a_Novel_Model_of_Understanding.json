{"id":"326918241_Socioeconomic_Status_and_Computer_Science_Achievement_Spatial_Ability_as_a_Mediating_Variable_in_a_Novel_Model_of_Understanding","abstract":"Socioeconomic status (SES) has a measurable impact on many educational outcomes and likely also influences computer science (CS) achievement. We present a novel model to account for the observed connections between SES and CS achievement. We examined possible mediating variables between SES and CS achievement, including spatial ability and access to computing. We define access as comprised of measurements of prior learning opportunities for computing, perceptions of computer science, and encouragement to pursue computing. The factors (SES, spatial ability, access to computing, and CS achievement) were measured through surveys completed by 163 students in introductory computing courses at a college level. Through the use of exploratory structural equation modeling, we found that these variables do impact each other, though not as we originally hypothesized. For our sample of students, we found spatial ability was a mediating variable for SES and CS achievement, but access to computing was not. Neither model explained all the variance, and our subject pool of US college students had higher than average SES. Our findings suggest that SES does influence success in computer science, but that relationship may not be due to access to computing education opportunities. Rather, SES might be influencing variables such as spatial ability which in turn influence CS performance.","authors":["Miranda Parker","Amber Solomon","Brianna Pritchett","David Anthony Illingworth"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3230977.3230987","Conference: the 2018 ACM Conference"],"references":["312551548_ICT_as_cultural_capital_The_relationship_between_socioeconomic_status_and_the_computer-use_profile_of_young_people","310818888_Replication_Validation_and_Use_of_a_Language_Independent_CS1_Knowledge_Assessment","285731029_Picture_this_Increasing_math_and_science_learning_by_improving_spatial_thinking","280626079_A_new_version_of_the_HBSC_Family_Affluence_Scale_-_FAS_III_Scottish_qualitative_findings_from_the_international_FAS_development_study","279558680_The_relationship_between_students'_exposure_to_technology_and_their_achievement_in_science_and_math","275227161_How_Much_Can_Spatial_Training_Improve_STEM_Achievement","257645071_Application_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling_in_Educational_Research_and_Practice","257393276_ICT_as_cultural_capital_The_relationship_between_socioeconomic_status_and_the_computer-use_profile_of_young_people","254345399_Reporting_Structural_Equation_Modeling_and_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Results_A_Review","250767761_Spatial_Ability_And_Learning_To_Program","241278052_Deciding_Between_Competing_Models_Chi-Square_Difference_Tests","235356240_Socioeconomic_Status_and_Academic_Achievement_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Research","234647977_How_the_Perceived_Masculinity_andor_Femininity_of_Software_Applications_Influences_Students'_Software_Preferences","232584315_The_Relation_Between_Socioeconomic_Status_and_Academic_Achievement","228627975_Spatial_Ability_for_STEM_Domains_Aligning_Over_50_Years_of_Cumulative_Psychological_Knowledge_Solidifies_Its_Importance","225216743_The_role_of_visual_representations_in_the_learning_of_mathematics_Educational_Studies_in_Mathematics_523_215-241","225184066_The_Malleability_of_Spatial_Skills_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Training_Studies","221307473_Using_Sex_Differences_to_Link_Spatial_Cognition_and_Program_Comprehension","216841553_Parents_as_Learning_Partners_in_the_Development_of_Technological_Fluency","44837024_Technology_and_equity_in_schooling_deconstructing_the_digital_divide","15726133_Stereotype_Threat_and_The_Intellectual_Test-Performance_of_African-Americans","12076318_Who's_Wired_and_Who's_Not_Children's_Access_to_and_Use_of_Computer_Technology","8084489_Neurocognitive_Correlates_of_Socioeconomic_Status_in_Kindergarten_Children","345768111_Mind_the_Gap_The_Digital_Dimension_of_College_Access","309254394_Psychometric_Theory","300117017_Spatial_Skills_Training_in_Introductory_Computing","300116078_Comparing_the_Effectiveness_of_Online_Learning_Approaches_on_CS1_Learning_Outcomes","289766290_Applying_Structural_Equation_Modeling_SEM_in_Educational_Research","277500498_Technology_and_Equity_in_Schooling_Deconstructing_the_Digital_Divide","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","262184607_Structural_equation_modeling","261876347_Psychometric_properties_of_the_revised_Purdue_Spatial_Visualization_Tests_Visualization_of_Rotations_The_Revised_PSVTR","255573999_Stuck_in_the_Shallow_End_Education_Race_and_Computing","254464158_A_Statewide_survey_on_computing_education_pathways_and_influences_Factors_in_broadening_participation_in_computing","248974874_Educational_Research_in_Developing_3-D_Spatial_Skills_for_Engineering_Students","242544141_EQS_Structural_Equation_Program_manual","239830109_Psychometric_properties_of_the_Revised_Purdue_Spatial_Visualization_Tests_Visualization_of_Rotations_the_Revised_PSVTR","238760801_Structural_Equation_Modeling_with_EQS_Basic_Concepts_Applications_and_Programming_2nd_Ed","236795520_Mind_the_Gap_The_Digital_Dimension_of_College_Access","232595584_Microcomputer_Learning_in_Small_Groups_Cognitive_Requirements_and_Group_Processes","232440752_Spatial_and_Numerical_Predictors_of_Measurement_Performance_The_Moderating_Effects_of_Community_Income_and_Gender","222702962_Promoting_academic_literacy_with_technology_Successful_laptop_programs_in_K-12_schools","220807265_Spatial_skills_and_navigation_of_source_code","220426367_Learning_to_Program_and_Learning_to_Think_What's_the_Connection","220175128_Home_Computers_and_School_Performance","35361089_The_relationship_between_socioeconomic_status_and_academic_achievement","23769690_Socioeconomic_status_and_the_developing_brain","7504001_Socioeconomic_Status_Modifies_the_Sex_Difference_in_Spatial_Skill","3226779_Female_graduate_students_and_program_quality"]}
