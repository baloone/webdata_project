{"id":"252231138_Nomenclature_in_the_Outer_Solar_System","abstract":"We define a nomenclature for the dynamical classification of objects in the outer solar system, mostly targeted at the Kuiper belt. We classify all 584 reasonable-quality orbits, as of May 2006. Our nomenclature uses moderate (10 m.y.) numerical integrations to help classify the current dynamical state of Kuiper belt objects as resonant or nonresonant, with the latter class then being subdivided according to stability and orbital parameters. The classification scheme has shown that a large fraction of objects in the \"scattered disk\" are actually resonant, many in previously unrecognized high-order resonances.","authors":["B.
