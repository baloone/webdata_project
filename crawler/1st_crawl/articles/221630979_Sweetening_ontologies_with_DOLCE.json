{"id":"221630979_Sweetening_ontologies_with_DOLCE","abstract":"In this paper we introduce the DOLCE upper level ontology, the first module of a Foundational Ontologies Library being developed within the WonderWeb project. DOLCE is presented here in an intuitive way; the reader should refer to the project deliverable for a detailed axiomatization. A comparison with WordNet's top-level taxonomy of nouns is also provided, which shows how DOLCE, used in addition to the OntoClean methodology, helps isolating and understanding some major WordNet's semantic limita- tions. We suggest that such analysis could hopefully lead to an \"ontologi- cally sweetened\" WordNet, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cogni- tively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications.","authors":["Aldo Gangemi","Nicola Guarino","Claudio Masolo","Alessandro Oltramari"],"meta":["October 2002","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45810-7_18","SourceDBLP","Conference: Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.
