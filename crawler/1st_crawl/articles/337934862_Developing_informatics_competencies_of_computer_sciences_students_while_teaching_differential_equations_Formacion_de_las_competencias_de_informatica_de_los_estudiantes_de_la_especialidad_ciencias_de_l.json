It is shown that computer support of teaching differential equations is appropriate to organize as the content of the educational website. The article covers the concept of the educational website and analyzes its content. The UI of the website helps select and combine methods, forms, and tools of teaching that help find, organize and analyze the required data from different sources, conduct high-performance computations based on cloud services.","authors":["Iryna Sitak","Kateryna Vlasenko","O.
