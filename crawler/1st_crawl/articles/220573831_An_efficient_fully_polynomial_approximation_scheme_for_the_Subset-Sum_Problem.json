{"id":"220573831_An_efficient_fully_polynomial_approximation_scheme_for_the_Subset-Sum_Problem","abstract":"Given a set of n positive integers and a knapsack of capacity c, the Subset-Sum Problem is to find a subset the sum of which is closest to c without exceeding the value c. In this paper we present a fully polynomial approximation scheme which solves the Subset-Sum Problem with accuracy ε in time O(min{n·1/ε,n+1/ε2log(1/ε)}) and space O(n+1/ε). This scheme has a better time and space complexity than previously known approximation schemes. Moreover, the scheme always finds the optimal solution if it is smaller than (1−ε)c. Computational results show that the scheme efficiently solves instances with up to 5000 items with a guaranteed relative error smaller than 1/1000.","authors":["Hans Kellerer","Renata Mansini","Ulrich Pferschy","M.Grazia Speranza"],"meta":["March 2003Journal of Computer and System Sciences 66:349-370","DOI:10.1016/S0022-0000(03)00006-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["266593737_Approximate_algorithms_for_certain_universal_problems_in_scheduling_theory","266333569_A_Fast_Approximation_Algorithm_For_The_Subset-Sum_Problem","266192712_The_fast_approximate_solution_of_hard_combinatorial_problems","242931914_Hard_Knapsack_Problems","228057772_Fast_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Knapsack_and_Sum_of_Subsets_Problems","226469627_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_knapsack_type_problems","225529665_Worst-case_analysis_of_greedy_algorithms_for_the_subset-sum_problem","225418024_The_Fully_Polynomial_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_0-1_Knapsack_Problem","222324546_Linear_Time_Algorithms_for_Knapsack_Problems_with_Bounded_Weights","221591949_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","220779313_Selecting_the_Median","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220617637_Selecting_the_Median","220573617_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","220442787_Fast_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Knapsack_Problems","220432022_Fast_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Knapsack_and_Sum_of_Subset_Problems","220089474_A_New_Fully_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Knapsack_Problem","220089386_Improved_Dynamic_Programming_in_Connection_with_an_FPTAS_for_the_Knapsack_Problem","200622062_Knapsack_Problems_Algorithms_and_Computer_Implementations","4942369_A_fully_polynomial_approximation_algorithm_for_the_0-1_knapsack_problem","4940381_Approximation_schemes_for_the_subset-sum_problem_Survey_and_experimental_analysis","4354709_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_knapsack_problems","2324605_A_Fast_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Subset-Sum_Problem"]}
