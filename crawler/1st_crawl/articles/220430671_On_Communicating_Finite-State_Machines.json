{"id":"220430671_On_Communicating_Finite-State_Machines","abstract":"A model of commumcations protocols based on finite-state machines is investigated. The problem addressed is how to ensure certain generally desirable properties, which make protocols \"well- formed,\" that is, specify a response to those and only those events that can actually occur. It is determined to what extent the problem is solvable, and one approach to solving it ts described.","authors":["Daniel Brand","Pitro Zafiropulo"],"meta":["April 1983Journal of the ACM 30(2):323-342","DOI:10.1145/322374.322380","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234777796_Communication_protocols_and_error_recovery_procedures","224732507_Towards_Analyzing_and_Synthesizing_Protocols","224732505_Formal_Methods_in_Communication_Protocol_Design","322027458_MULTILEVEL_SPECIFICATION_AND_VALIDATION_OF_THE_CONTROL_IN_COMMUNICATION_SYSTEMS","267089337_Behavioural_descriptions_of_communication_switching_systems_using_extended_Petri_nets","247032923_On_the_construction_of_communication_protocols","243674709_Synthesis_of_protocols_for_an_unlimited_number_of_processes","242609318_Verifying_Network_Protocols_Using_Temporal_Logic","242578043_Automatically_verified_data_transfer_protocols","234809883_A_Note_On_Applicable_Full-Duplex_Transmission_Over_Link_Half-Duplex","224732515_Executable_Description_and_Validation_of_SNA","224732255_Specification_and_Validation_of_Protocols","224732179_Protocol_Validation_by_Duologue-Matrix_Analysis","224731741_A_Methodology_for_the_Design_and_Implementation_of_Communication_Protocols","224104287_Automated_Validation_of_a_Communications_Protocol_the_CCITT_X21_Recommendation","222446361_Finite_State_Description_of_Communication_Protocols","221498280_Parallel_Program_Schemata_A_Mathematical_Model_for_Parallel_Computation","220566015_Petri_Nets","220445370_Verification_of_Protocols_Using_Symbolic_Execution","220419791_A_note_on_reliable_full-duplex_transmission_over_half-duplex_links"]}
