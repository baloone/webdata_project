{"id":"225480574_Computing_Deblurred_Time-Frequency_Distributions_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This paper presents an effective correlation vectored taxonomy algorithm to compute highly concentrated time-frequency distributions\n(TFDs) using localized neural networks (LNNs). Spectrograms and pre-processed Wignerâ€“Ville distributions of known signals\nare vectorized and clustered as per the elbow criterion to constitute the training data for multiple artificial neural networks.\nThe best trained networks become part of the LNNs. Test TFDs of unknown signals are then processed through the algorithm and\npresented to the LNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that appropriately vectored and clustered data once processed through\nthe LNNs produce high resolution TFDs. Examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via analysis\nbased on entropy and visual interpretation.","authors":["Imran Shafi","Ahmad Jamil","Syed Ismail Shah","Faisal M.
