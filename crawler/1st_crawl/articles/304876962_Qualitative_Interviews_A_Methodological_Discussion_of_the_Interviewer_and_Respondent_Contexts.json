{"id":"304876962_Qualitative_Interviews_A_Methodological_Discussion_of_the_Interviewer_and_Respondent_Contexts","abstract":"Interviews are a staple method used in qualitative research. Many authors hold face-to-face interviews to be the gold standard, or the assumed best mode in which to conduct interviews. However, a large number of research projects are based on conducting interviews via telephone. While some scholars have addressed the advantages and disadvantages of using telephones to conduct interviews, this work is scattered across multiple disciplines and lacks a cohesive, comprehensive framework. The current article seeks to rectify this gap in the literature, by explicitly developing the constructs of the interviewer context and the respondent context. By examining key components in each of these contexts, the qualitative interviewer can make an informed, reflective decision about the best interview mode to use for a particular project.\n\nURN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602156","authors":["Shannon M.
