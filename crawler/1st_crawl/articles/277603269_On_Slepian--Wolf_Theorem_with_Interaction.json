{"id":"277603269_On_Slepian--Wolf_Theorem_with_Interaction","abstract":"In this paper we study interactive \"one-shot\" analogues of the classical\nSlepian-Wolf theorem. Alice receives a value of a random variable $X$, Bob\nreceives a value of another random variable $Y$ that is jointly distributed\nwith $X$. Alice's goal is to transmit $X$ to Bob (with some error probability\n$\\varepsilon$). Instead of one-way transmission, which is studied in the\nclassical coding theory, we allow them to interact. They may also use shared\nrandomness.\nWe show, that Alice can transmit $X$ to Bob in expected $H(X|Y) +\n2\\sqrt{H(X|Y)} + O(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right))$ number of bits.\nThis improves a result by Braverman and Rao, where they had $5\\sqrt{H(X|Y)}$.\nFurther, we show how to solve this problem using $3H(X|Y) +\nO(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right))$ bits and $4$ rounds on average.\nIn the end of the paper we discuss how many bits Alice and Bob may need to\ncommunicate on average besides $H(X|Y)$. The main question is whether the upper\nbounds mentioned above are tight. We provide an example of $(X, Y)$, such that\ntransmission of $X$ from Alice to Bob with error probability $\\eps$ requires\n$H(X|Y) + \\Omega\\left(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)$ bits on\naverage.","authors":["Alexander Nikolaevich Kozachinskiy"],"meta":["April 2018Theory of Computing Systems 62(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9741-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261469585_Towards_a_Reverse_Newman's_Theorem_in_Interactive_Information_Complexity","275588323_Information_Complexity_and_the_Quest_for_Interactive_Compression_A_Survey","267661316_Public_vs_Private_Coin_in_Bounded-Round_Information","266920237_Information_Theory_and_Network_Coding","260699149_Interactive_communication","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","222477337_Private_vs_common_random_bits_in_communication_complexity","220690121_Communication_Complexity","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","51912125_Information_Equals_Amortized_Communication","3082237_Noiseless_coding_of_correlated_information_sources","3078088_Average-case_interactive_communication"]}
