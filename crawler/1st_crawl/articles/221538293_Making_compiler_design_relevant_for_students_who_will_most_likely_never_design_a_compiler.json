{"id":"221538293_Making_compiler_design_relevant_for_students_who_will_most_likely_never_design_a_compiler","abstract":"Compiler Design courses are a common component of most modern Computer Science undergraduate curricula. At the same time, however, compiler design has become a highly specialized topic, and it is not clear that a significant number of Computer Science students will find themselves designing compilers professionally. This paper argues that the principles, techniques, and tools discussed in compiler design courses are nevertheless applicable to a wide variety of situations that would generally not be considered to be compiler design. Generalizing the content of compiler design courses to emphasize this broad applicability can make them more relevant to students.","authors":["Saumya K.
