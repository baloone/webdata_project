{"id":"242921899_Relative_Distance--An_Error_Measure_in_Round-Off_Error_Analysis","abstract":"Olver (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., v. 15, 1978, pp. 368-393) suggested relative precision as an attractive substitute for relative error in round-off error analysis. He remarked that in certain respects the error measure $d(\\bar x, x) = \\min\\{\\alpha \\mid 1 - \\alpha \\leqslant x/\\bar x \\leqslant 1/(1 - \\alpha)\\}, \\bar x \\neq 0, x/\\ bar x > 0$ is even more favorable, through it seems to be inferior because of two drawbacks which are not shared by relative precision: (i) the inequality $d(\\bar x^k, x^k) \\leqslant |k| d(\\bar x, x)$ is not true for $0 0$, and is free of (ii). The inequality $d(\\bar x^k, x^k) \\leqslant |k| d(\\bar x, x)$ is replaced by the more universally valid inequality $d(\\bar x^k, x^k) \\leqslant |k| d(\\bar x, x)/(1 - \\delta), \\delta = \\max\\{d(\\bar x, x), |k| d(\\bar x, x)\\}$. The favorable properties of $d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ are preserved in the complex case. Moreover, its definition may be generalized to linear normed spaces by $d(\\bar x, x) = \\|\\bar x - x\\|/\\max\\{\\|\\bar x\\|, \\|x\\|\\}$. Its properties in such spaces raise the possibility that with further investigation it might become the basis for error analysis in some vector, matrix, and function spaces.","authors":["Abraham Ziv"],"meta":["October 1982Mathematics of Computation 39(160)","DOI:10.2307/2007334"],"references":["324303791_Rounding_Errors_in_Algebraic_Processes","242431770_Rounding_Errors_in_Algebraic_Processes","238704067_A_New_Approach_to_Error_Arithmetic","224043857_Elements_of_the_Theory_of_Functional_Analysis-I_Metric_and_Normed_Spaces","221331737_Rounding_Errors_in_Algebraic_Problems","220618352_A_Round-Off_Error_Model_with_Applications_to_Arithmetic_Expressions","50333416_Introduction_to_Matrix_Computations","2504383_Principles_of_Floating_Point_Computation"]}
