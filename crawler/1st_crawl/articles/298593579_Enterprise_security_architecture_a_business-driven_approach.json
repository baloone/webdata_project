{"id":"298593579_Enterprise_security_architecture_a_business-driven_approach","abstract":"The features of SABSAÂ®, a model and a methodology for developing risk-driven enterprise information security architectures, are discussed. The model is generic and can be the starting point of any organization, but by going through the process of analysis and decision-making implied by its structure, it becomes specific to the enterprise. In the model, the business view is called the contextual security architecture, which is a description of the business context in which the secure system must be designed, built, and operated. Despite the fragmented projects, the overall systems environment should maintain its architectural integrity.","authors":["J. Sherwood","A. Clark","D.
