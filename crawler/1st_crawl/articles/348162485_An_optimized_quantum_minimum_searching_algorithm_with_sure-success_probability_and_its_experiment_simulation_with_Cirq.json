Durr and Hoyer proposed a quantum searching algorithm (DHA), with a certain probability of success, to achieve quadratic speed than classical ones. In this paper, we propose an optimized quantum minimum searching algorithm with sure-success probability, which utilizes Grover-Long searching to implement the optimal exact searching, and the dynamic strategy to reduce the iterations of our algorithm. Besides, we optimize the oracle circuit to reduce the number of gates by the simplified rules. The performance evaluation including the theoretical success rate and computational complexity shows that our algorithm has higher accuracy and efficiency than DHA algorithm. Finally, a simulation experiment based on Cirq is performed to verify its feasibility.","authors":["Wenjie Liu","Qingshan Wu","Jiahao Shen","Jiaojiao Zhao"],"meta":["November 2021Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing 12(4):1-10","DOI:10.1007/s12652-020-02840-z"],"references":["340322205_Quantum-Based_Feature_Selection_for_Multiclassification_Problem_in_Complex_Systems_with_Edge_Computing","338021358_Quantum_Searchable_Encryption_for_Cloud_Data_Based_on_Full-Blind_Quantum_Computation","334686887_A_Novel_Quantum_Visual_Secret_Sharing_Scheme","332152502_A_Quantum-Based_Database_Query_Scheme_for_Privacy_Preservation_in_Cloud_Environment","341745819_ARSH-FATI_a_Novel_Metaheuristic_for_Cluster_Head_Selection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","340550809_A_Novel_Meta-Heuristic_for_Green_Computing_on_VFI-NoC-HMPSoCs","335470612_Privacy-Preserving_Quantum_Two-Party_Geometric_Intersection","332174848_Quantum_Homomorphic_Signature_with_Repeatable_Verification","331422067_Energy_Efficient_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Task_Mapping_on_Shared-Memory_Heterogeneous_MPSoCs","330590749_Quantum_private_query_A_new_kind_of_practical_quantum_cryptographic_protocol","321177151_Efficient_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_with_collective_detection","320030783_An_Efficient_and_Secure_Arbitrary_N-Party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Protocol_Using_Bell_States","262336092_Highlighting_the_Mechanism_of_the_Quantum_Speedup_by_Time-Symmetric_and_Relational_Quantum_Mechanics","252427046_Quantum_Exponential_Function","323904931_Quantum_Machine_Learning_in_Feature_Hilbert_Spaces"]}
