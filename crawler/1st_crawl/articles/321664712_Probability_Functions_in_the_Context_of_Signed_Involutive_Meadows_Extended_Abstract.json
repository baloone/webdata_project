{"id":"321664712_Probability_Functions_in_the_Context_of_Signed_Involutive_Meadows_Extended_Abstract","abstract":"The Kolmogorov axioms for probability functions are placed in the context of signed meadows. A completeness theorem is stated and proven for the resulting equational theory of probability calculus. Elementary definitions of probability theory are restated in this framework.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Alban Ponse"],"meta":["December 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-72044-9_6","In book: Recent Trends in Algebraic Development Techniques (pp.73-87)"],"references":["30965353_Bruno_de_Finetti_and_the_Logic_of_Conditional_Events","1916835_Cancellation_Meadows_A_Generic_Basis_Theorem_and_Some_Applications","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","268539299_A_Self-Dual_Equational_Basis_for_Boolean_Algebras","268451688_Fracpairs_fractions_over_a_reduced_commutative_ring","267469812_Bayesian_Reasoning_and_Machine_Learning","262974724_Division_by_zero_in_non-involutive_meadows","261009957_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics_an_Empiricist_Approach","258082303_Equations_for_formally_real_meadows","243679555_Probability_and_the_Logic_of_Conditionals","243469845_Hidden_Variables_Joint_Probability_and_the_Bell_Inequalities","234991434_Joint_distributions_quantum_correlations_and_commuting_observables","228109469_On_the_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox","226820058_The_bell_inequalities","222652039_Inversive_Meadows_and_Divisive_Meadows","220173535_Wheels_-_on_division_by_zero"]}
