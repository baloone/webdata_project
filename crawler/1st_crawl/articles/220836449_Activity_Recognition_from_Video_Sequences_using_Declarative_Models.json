{"id":"220836449_Activity_Recognition_from_Video_Sequences_using_Declarative_Models","abstract":"We propose here a new approach for video sequence in- terpretation based on declarative models of activities. The aim of the video sequence interpretation is to recognize incrementaly certain situations, like states of the scene, events and scenarios, in a video stream, in order to understand what happens in the scene. The in- put of the activity recognition is an a priori model of the scene and human tracked in it. The activity recognition is composed of two subproblems. First, end-users have to declare all the activities in a configuration phase. Secondly, the declared models must be auto- matically recognized. To solve the first problem, we propose a ho- mogeneous declarative formalism to describe all the activities (states of the scene, events and scenarios). The activities are described by the conditions between the objects of the scene. To solve the second problem, we translate it into a constraints satisfaction problem. Then, we use a classical CSP algorithm to recognize the activities in video sequences. Finally, we present some results to show the robustness of the approach.","authors":["NathanaÃ«l Rota","Monique Thonnat"],"meta":["January 2000","SourceDBLP","Conference: ECAI 2000, Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Berlin, Germany, August 20-25, 2000"],"references":["3612984_Closed-world_tracking","2778027_On_the_Simultaneous_Interpretation_of_Real_World_Image_Sequences_and_their_Natural_Language_Description_The_System_SOCCER","2409802_What_is_going_on_A_high_level_interpretation_of_sequences_of_images","222260746_Visual_surveillance_in_a_dynamic_and_uncertain_world","3809130_Video_surveillance_of_interactions"]}
