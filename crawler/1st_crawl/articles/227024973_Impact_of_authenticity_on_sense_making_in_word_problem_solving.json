{"id":"227024973_Impact_of_authenticity_on_sense_making_in_word_problem_solving","abstract":"The study presented in this paper seeks to investigate the impact of authenticity on the students’ disposition to make necessary\nreal world considerations in their word problem solving. The aim is also to gather information about the extent to which different\nreasons for the students’ behaviors are responsible for not providing solutions that are consistent with the ‘real’ situations\ndescribed in the word problems. The study includes both written solutions to word problems and interview data from 161 5th\ngraders. The results show an impact of authenticity on both the presence of ‘real life’ considerations in the solution process\nand on the proportion of written solutions that were really affected by these considerations. The students’ frequent use of\nsuperficial solution strategies and their beliefs about mathematical word problem solving were found to be the main reasons\nfor providing solutions that are inconsistent with the situations described in the word problems.","authors":["Torulf Palm"],"meta":["January 2008Educational Studies in Mathematics 67(1):37-58","DOI:10.1007/s10649-007-9083-3"],"references":["280804134_Realistic_Mathematical_Modeling_through_the_Solving_of_Performance_Tasks","258510299_Sense_Making_and_the_Solution_of_Division_Problems_Involving_Remainders_An_Examination_of_Middle_School_Students'_Solution_Processes_and_Their_Interpretations_of_Solutions","234664387_Assessing_Children's_Mathematical_Knowledge_Social_Class_Sex_and_Problem-Solving","226757527_Problem_solving_beyond_the_logic_of_things_Contextual_effects_on_understanding_and_solving_word_problems","292249109_The_culture_of_mathematics_and_the_culture_of_schools","289963732_Modelling_reality_in_mathematics_classrooms_The_coase_of_word_problems","288906342_Word_problems_as_simulations_of_real-world_situations_A_proposed_framework","284824174_Solving_everyday_problems_in_the_formal_setting_An_empirical_study_of_the_school_as_context_for_thought","283693232_Results_of_the_Third_NAEP_Mathematics_Assessment_Secondary_School","271960731_Upper_Elementary_School_Pupils'_Difficulties_in_Modeling_and_Solving_Nonstandard_Additive_Word_Problems_Involving_Ordinal_Numbers","271814082_Teaching_Realistic_Mathematical_Modeling_in_the_Elementary_School_A_Teaching_Experiment_with_Fifth_Graders","263951666_Assessing_Children's_Mathematical_Knowledge_Social_Class_Sex_and_Problem-Solving","262187490_Mathematical_Problem_Solving","258510422_Solution_Processes_and_Interpretations_of_Solutions_in_Solving_a_Division-with-Remainder_Story_Problem_Do_Chinese_and_U_S_Students_Have_Similar_Difficulties","254702915_Making_Sense_of_Word_Problems","248498128_The_realistic_reasons_behind_unrealistic_solutions_The_role_of_interpretive_activity_in_word_problem_solving","248498059_Modelling_reality_in_mathematics_classrooms_The_case_of_word_problems","248072272_Theory_of_Didactical_Situations_in_Mathematics","242453569_Mathematical_reasoning_in_task_solving","234716854_A_Division_Problem_with_a_Remainder_Embedded_across_Two_Contexts_Children's_Solutions_in_Restrictive_vs_Real-world_Settings","232606647_Problem-solving_academic_performance_and_situated_reasoning_A_study_of_joint_cognitive_activity_in_the_formal_setting","232590419_The_mathematical_modeling_perspective_on_world_problems","232493749_Comprehension_of_Arithmetic_Word_Problems_A_Comparison_of_Successful_and_Unsuccessful_Problem_Solvers","226556942_Children's_Responses_to_Contrasting_Realistic'_Mathematics_Problems_Just_how_realistic_are_children_ready_to_be","226028605_The_Predominance_of_the_Linear_Model_in_Secondary_School_Students'_Solutions_of_Word_Problems_Involving_Length_and_Area_of_Similar_Plane_Figures","225930047_Mathematical_Reasoning_in_School_Tasks","225922456_Verschaffel_L_Greer_B_and_de_Corte_E_Making_Sense_of_Word_Problems","223690245_Realistic_considerations_in_mathematical_modeling_of_school_arithmetic_word_problems","223469889_Realistic_considerations_in_solving_problematic_word_problems_Do_Japanese_and_Belgian_children_have_the_same_difficulties","223359305_Every_word_problem_has_a_solution-The_social_rationality_of_mathematical_modeling_in_schools","223141382_Pre-Service_teachers_conceptions_and_beliefs_about_the_role_of_real-world_knowledge_in_mathematical_modelling_of_school_word_problems","222764608_Children's_use_of_realistic_considerations_in_problem_solving_Some_English_evidence"]}
