{"id":"330203342_The_need_for_uncertainty_quantification_in_machine-assisted_medical_decision_making","abstract":"Medicine, even from the earliest days of artificial intelligence (AI) research, has been one of the most inspiring and promising\ndomains for the application of AI-based approaches. Equally, it has been one of the more challenging areas to see an effective\nadoption. There are many reasons for this, primarily the reluctance to delegate decision making to machine intelligence in cases\nwhere patient safety is at stake. To address some of these challenges, medical AI, especially in its modern data-rich deep learning\nguise, needs to develop a principled and formal uncertainty quantification (UQ) discipline, just as we have seen in fields\nsuch as nuclear stockpile stewardship and risk management. The data-rich world of AI-based learning and the frequent absence\nof a well-understood underlying theory poses its own unique challenges to straightforward adoption of UQ. These challenges,\nwhile not trivial, also present significant new research opportunities for the development of new theoretical approaches, and\nfor the practical applications of UQ in the area of machine-assisted medical decision making. Understanding prediction system\nstructure and defensibly quantifying uncertainty is possible, and, if done, can significantly benefit both research and practical\napplications of AI in this critical domain.","authors":["Edmon Begoli","Tanmoy Bhattacharya","Dimitri Kusnezov"],"meta":["January 2019Nature","DOI:10.1038/s42256-018-0004-1"],"references":["325473817_Artificial_intelligence_for_melanoma_diagnosis_How_can_we_deliver_on_the_promise","324643719_A_Study_on_Overfitting_in_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","324372333_Readmission_prediction_via_deep_contextual_embedding_of_clinical_concepts","323319571_Deep_learning_based_tissue_analysis_predicts_outcome_in_colorectal_cancer","322695006_Scalable_and_accurate_deep_learning_for_electronic_health_records","318708357_Applying_deep_neural_networks_to_unstructured_text_notes_in_electronic_medical_records_for_phenotyping_youth_depression","317673956_A_Closer_Look_at_Memorization_in_Deep_Networks","316354788_Prediction_of_Organic_Reaction_Outcomes_Using_Machine_Learning","315779698_Can_Machine-learning_improve_cardiovascular_risk_prediction_using_routine_clinical_data","313186428_Cancer_Moonshot_Data_and_Technology_Team_Enabling_a_National_Learning_Healthcare_System_for_Cancer_to_Unleash_the_Power_of_Data","259919543_Interplay_between_Epigenetics_and_Genetics_in_Cancer","237076931_Verification_and_Validation_in_Scientific_Computing","220320908_On_Over-fitting_in_Model_Selection_and_Subsequent_Selection_Bias_in_Performance_Evaluation","332810072_Generative_OpenMax_for_Multi-Class_Open_Set_Classification","323373904_Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses_and_Treatable_Diseases_by_Image-Based_Deep_Learning","322818773_Structured_Memory_based_Deep_Model_to_Detect_as_well_as_Characterize_Novel_Inputs","318829485_Open_Category_Classification_by_Adversarial_Sample_Generation","318671326_Generative_OpenMax_for_Multi-Class_Open_Set_Classification","317100699_Open-Category_Classification_by_Adversarial_Sample_Generation","313773632_Making_Sense_of_the_Mountains_of_New_Cancer_Data","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","310122390_Understanding_deep_learning_requires_rethinking_generalization","286382307_Why_Deep_Learning_Works_A_Manifold_Disentanglement_Perspective","277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning","221727965_Zuk_O_Hechter_E_Sunyaev_SR_Lander_ES_The_mystery_of_missing_heritability_genetic_interactions_create_phantom_heritability_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_109_1193-1198"]}
