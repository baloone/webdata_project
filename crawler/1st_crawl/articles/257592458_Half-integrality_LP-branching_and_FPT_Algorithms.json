{"id":"257592458_Half-integrality_LP-branching_and_FPT_Algorithms","abstract":"A recent trend in parameterized algorithms is the application of polytope\ntools (specifically, LP-branching) to FPT algorithms (e.g., Cygan et al., 2011;\nNarayanaswamy et al., 2012). However, although interesting results have been\nachieved, the methods require the underlying polytope to have very restrictive\nproperties (half-integrality and persistence), which are known only for few\nproblems (essentially Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node\nMultiway Cut (Garg et al., 1994)). Taking a slightly different approach, we\nview half-integrality as a \\emph{discrete} relaxation of a problem, e.g., a\nrelaxation of the search space from $\\{0,1\\}^V$ to $\\{0,1/2,1\\}^V$ such that\nthe new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from CSP\n(in particular Thapper and \\v{Z}ivn\\'y, 2012) to study the existence of such\nrelaxations, we provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with\nthe required properties, unifying and extending previously known cases.\nIn addition to the insight into problems with half-integral relaxations, our\nresults yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an\n$O^*(|\\Sigma|^{2k})$-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover with\nlabel set $\\Sigma$ and an $O^*(4^k)$-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex\nSet, including the setting where the group is only given by oracle access. All\nthese significantly improve on previous results. The latter result also implies\nthe first single-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set,\nanswering an open question of Cygan et al. (2012).","authors":["Magnus Wahlstr√∂m"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973402.128","SourcearXiv"],"references":["230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","225749303_An_algorithm_for_packing_non-zero_A-paths_in_group-labelled_graphs","222630004_Constraints_consistency_and_closure","221668653_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_Using_Linear_Programming","220994453_LP_can_be_a_cure_for_Parameterized_Problems","220533459_Delta-Matroids_Jump_Systems_and_Bisubmodular_Polyhedra","220488070_Solving_Connectivity_Problems_Parameterized_by_Treewidth_in_Single_Exponential_Time","4082644_Tight_lower_bounds_for_certain_parameterized_NP-hard_problems","2822026_A_Factor_2_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Generalized_Steiner_Network_Problem","2518937_Multimatroids_II_Orthogonality_minors_and_connectivity","316805575_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","268642744_Combinatorial_optimization_Polyhedra_and_efficiency_3_volumes","258727797_The_complexity_of_finite-valued_CSPs","258566832_The_Power_of_Linear_Programming_for_General-Valued_CSPs","256926255_Towards_Minimizing_k-Submodular_Functions","249387734_Packing_NonZero_A-Paths_In_Group-Labelled_Graphs","242422660_Vertex_packing_structural_properties_and_algorithms","238850399_Multimatroids_IV_Chain-group_representations","238720638_A_4k2_kernel_for_feedback_vertex_set","230570499_The_Power_of_Linear_Programming_for_Finite-Valued_CSPs_A_Constructive_Characterization","229157396_Designing_FPT_Algorithms_for_Cut_Problems_Using_Randomized_Contractions","226040085_Subset_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","225802871_Submodular_function_minimization","222952794_Solving_integer_programs_over_monotone_inequalities_in_three_variables_A_framework_for_half_integrality_and_good_approximations","222923068_Strong_computational_lower_bounds_via_parameterized_complexity","222830024_Multiway_cuts_in_node_weighted_graphs","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222561079_Tight_lower_bounds_for_certain_parameterized_NP-hard_problems","222559358_Non-zero_disjoint_cycles_in_highly_connected_group_labelled_graphs","222553119_Iterative_Rounding_2-Approximation_Algorithms_for_Minimum-Cost_Vertex_Connectivity_Problems","222514750_A_Combinatorial_Algorithm_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions_in_Strongly_Polynomial_Time","222507230_A_Primal-Dual_Interpretation_of_Two_2-Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem_in_Undirected_Graphs","222282994_Multimatroids_III_Tightness_and_Fundamental_Graphs","221590714_Optimal_algorithms_and_inapproximability_results_for_every_CSP","221499396_Submodular_Function_Minimization_under_Covering_Constraints","221316995_Coverings_and_Delta-Coverings","220532793_Multimatroids_I_Coverings_by_Independent_Sets","220430827_A_combinatorial_strongly_polynomial_algorithm_for_minimizing_submodular_functions","220223596_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Integral_Flow_and_Multicut_in_Trees","220187618_Packing_non-returning_A-paths_algorithmically","220090558_FPT_algorithms_for_path-transversal_and_cycle-transversal_problems","51968652_On_Group_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Parameterized_by_the_Size_of_the_Cutset","51952991_Representative_Sets_and_Irrelevant_Vertices_New_Tools_for_Kernelization","51915737_On_Multiway_Cut_Parameterized_above_Lower_Bounds","48207841_Min_CSP_on_Four_Elements_Moving_beyond_Submodularity","45917425_Generalized_roof_duality_and_bisubmodular_functions","3948668_On_the_power_of_unique_2-prover_1-round_games","2436398_Bisubmodular_Function_Minimization"]}
