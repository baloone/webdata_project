{"id":"44105445_Total-Coloring_of_Plane_Graphs_with_Maximum_Degree_Nine","abstract":"The central problem of the total-colorings is the total-coloring conjecture, which asserts that every graph of maximum degree D admits a (D+2)-total-coloring. Similar to edge-colorings—with Vizing's edge-coloring conjecture—this bound can be decreased by 1 for plane graphs of higher maximum degree. More precisely, it is known that if D > 9, then every plane graph of maximum degree D is (D+1)-totally-colorable. On the other hand, such a statement does not hold if D < 4. We prove that every plane graph of maximum degree 9 can be 10-totally-colored.","authors":["Lukasz Kowalik","Jean-Sébastien Sereni","Riste Škrekovski"],"meta":["October 2008SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 22(4)","DOI:10.1137/070688389","SourceDBLP"],"references":["319583303_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","265443371_On_the_total_coloring_of_planar_graphs","265354541_The_total_chromatic_number_of_some_graphs","265354457_Total_Colourings_of_Graphs","257294518_A_note_on_the_total_chromatic_number_of_Halin_graphs_with_maximum_degree_4","248664431_Every_planar_map_is_four_colorable_Part_I_Discharging","246115566_Every_Planar_Map_is_Four_Colorable","243087693_Nombre_Chromatique_Total_Du_Graphe_R-Parti_Complet","243038268_Some_unsolved_problems_in_graph_theory_Russian","242911063_On_total_9-coloring_planar_graphs_of_maximum_degree_seven"]}
