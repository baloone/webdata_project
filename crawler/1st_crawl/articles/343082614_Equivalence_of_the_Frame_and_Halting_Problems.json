{"id":"343082614_Equivalence_of_the_Frame_and_Halting_Problems","abstract":"The open-domain Frame Problem is the problem of determining what features of an open task environment need to be updated following an action. Here we prove that the open-domain Frame Problem is equivalent to the Halting Problem and is therefore undecidable. We discuss two other open-domain problems closely related to the Frame Problem, the system identification problem and the symbol-grounding problem, and show that they are similarly undecidable. We then reformulate the Frame Problem as a quantum decision problem, and show that it is undecidable by any finite quantum computer.","authors":["Eric Dietrich","Chris Fields"],"meta":["July 2020Algorithms 13(7):175","DOI:10.3390/a13070175"],"references":["342319106_Holographic_Screens_Are_Classical_Information_Channels","338505624_When_Science_Confronts_Philosophy_Three_Case_Studies","331663167_Immunity-Based_Dynamic_Reconfiguration_of_Mobile_Robots_in_Unstructured_Environments","328349834_Some_Consequences_of_the_Thermodynamic_Cost_of_System_Identification","326879849_Advancing_Autonomy_by_Developing_a_Mission_Planning_Architecture_Case_Study_Autonomous_Underwater_Vehicle_Augmented_Reactive_Mission_and_Motion_Planning_Architecture","320910022_Towards_Autonomous_Planetary_Exploration_The_Lightweight_Rover_Unit_LRU_its_Success_in_the_SpaceBotCamp_Challenge_and_Beyond","333152087_Four-Valued_Semantics_for_Granular_Reasoning_Towards_Frame_Problem","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","320582589_On_Universality_of_Classical_Probability_with_Contextually_Labeled_Random_Variables","313044565_The_Causal_Frame_Problem_An_Algorithmic_Perspective"]}
