{"id":"326840767_Coding_as_a_Playground_Programming_and_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Early_Childhood_Classroom","abstract":"Coding as a Playground is the first book to focus on how young children (ages 7 and under) can engage in computational thinking and be taught to become computer programmers, a process that can increase both their cognitive and social-emotional skills. Readers will learn how coding can engage children as producers–and not merely consumers–of technology in a playful way. You will come away from this groundbreaking work with an understanding of how coding promotes developmentally appropriate experiences such as problem solving, imagination, cognitive challenges, social interactions, motor skills development, emotional exploration, and making different choices. You will also learn how to integrate coding into different curricular areas to promote literacy, math, science, engineering, and the arts through a project-based approach.","authors":["Marina Umaschi Bers"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.4324/9781315398945","ISBN: 9781315398945"],"references":["318573897_Media_and_Young_Minds"]}
