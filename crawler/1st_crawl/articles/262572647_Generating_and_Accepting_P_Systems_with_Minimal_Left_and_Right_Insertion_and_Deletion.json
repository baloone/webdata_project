{"id":"262572647_Generating_and_Accepting_P_Systems_with_Minimal_Left_and_Right_Insertion_and_Deletion","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the operations of insertion and deletion performed at the ends of a string. We show that using these operations in a P systems framework (which corresponds to using specific variants of graph control), computational completeness can even be achieved with the operations of left and right insertion and deletion of only one symbol, both in the generating as well as in the accepting case.","authors":["Rudolf Freund","Yurii Rogozhin","Sergey Verlan"],"meta":["June 2014Natural Computing 13(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11047-013-9396-3"],"references":["351371775_Study_of_language-theoretic_computational_paradigms_inspired_by_biology","262358000_P_Systems_with_Minimal_Left_and_Right_Insertion_and_Deletion","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","247416179_RNA_Editing_The_Alteration_of_Protein_Coding_Sequences_of_RNA","239538954_Formal_reduction_of_the_general_combinatorial_decision_problem","238719555_Membrane_Computing_10th_International_Workshop_WMC_2009_Curtea_de_Arges_Romania_August_24-27_2009_Revised_Selected_and_Invited_Papers","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing"]}
