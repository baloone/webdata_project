This influence is tested in three mechanical applications chosen from the literature. The results show how the robust concept of the problem is affected besides the optimization results, this reveals the necessity to choose the suitable uncertainties model before performing the optimization.","authors":["Oussama Braydi","Pascal Lafon","Rafic Younes"],"meta":["April 2018","Conference: ICVRAM-ISUMA-UNCERTAINTIES 2018At: Florianopolis,  Brazil","Project: Global framework of optimization in probabilistic context for mechanical engineering"],"references":["327108243_A_New_Hybrid_Method_to_Solve_the_Multi-objective_Optimization_Problem_for_a_Composite_Hat-Stiffened_Panel","308031060_Sequential_improvement_for_robust_optimization_using_an_uncertainty_measure_for_radial_basis_functions","281602924_Optimisation_robuste_multiobjectifs_par_modeles_de_substitution","226317334_The_Use_of_Metamodeling_Techniques_for_Optimization_Under_Uncertainty","225523426_System_reliability_based_vehicle_design_for_crashworthiness_and_effects_of_various_uncertainty_reduction_measures","307869502_On_the_consideration_of_uncertainty_in_design_optimization_-_reliability_-_robustness","243766612_Optimal_Design_of_a_Class_of_Welded_Structures_Using_Geometric_Programming","239535128_Using_Common_Random_Numbers_and_Control_Variates_in_Multiple-Comparison_Procedures","232924247_Exact_propagation_of_uncertainties_in_multiplicative_models","222702934_Robust_optimization_-_A_comprehensive_survey"]}
