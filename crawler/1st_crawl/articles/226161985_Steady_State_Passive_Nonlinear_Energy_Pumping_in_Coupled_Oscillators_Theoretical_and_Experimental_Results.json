{"id":"226161985_Steady_State_Passive_Nonlinear_Energy_Pumping_in_Coupled_Oscillators_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Results","abstract":"We study theoretically and experimentally the effect that anonlinear energy sink (NES) has on the steady state dynamics of a weaklycoupled system. The NES possesses essentially nonlinear(nonlinearizable) stiffness nonlinearity of the third degree. We findthat, in contrast to the classical linear vibration absorber, the NES iscapable of absorbing steady state vibration energy from the linearoscillator over a relatively broad frequency range. This results inlocalization of the steady state vibration in the NES, away from thedirectly forced subsystem. For a forward frequency sweep the localizedbranch of steady state motions is suddenly eliminated by a jump to alinearized low-amplitude motion, whereas, for a backward frequency sweepa reverse jump occurs. The difference in the frequencies of the twojumps introduces a nonlinear hysteresis loop. This work extends to thesteady state case of earlier transient passive energy pumping results.The notion of passively transferring vibration energy to an a prioridetermined NES, weakly attached to a main structure, is novel. The useof nonlinear energy sinks for passively absorbing energy from a linearmain structure can form the basis of relatively simple and modularvibration and shock isolation designs of mechanical systems.","authors":["Xiaoai Jiang","Donald Michael McFarland","Lawrence A.
