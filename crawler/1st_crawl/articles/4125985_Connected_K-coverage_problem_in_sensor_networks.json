{"id":"4125985_Connected_K-coverage_problem_in_sensor_networks","abstract":"In overdeployed sensor networks, one approach to conserve energy is to keep only a small subset of sensors active at any instant. In this article, we consider the problem of selecting a minimum size connected K-cover, which is defined as a set of sensors M such that each point in the sensor network is \"covered\" by at least K different sensors in M, and the communication graph induced by M is connected. For the above optimization problem, we design a centralized approximation algorithm that delivers a near-optimal (within a factor of O(lg n)) solution, and present a distributed version of the algorithm. We also present a communication-efficient localized distributed algorithm which is empirically shown to perform well","authors":["Zongheng Zhou","SR Das","Himanshu Gupta"],"meta":["November 2004","DOI:10.1109/ICCCN.2004.1401672","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Communications and Networks, 2004.
