{"id":"313793085_Effect_of_slotted_exit_orifice_on_performance_of_plasma_synthetic_jet_actuator","abstract":"This study experimentally investigates the influence of exit orifice shape on the performance characteristics of a three-electrode plasma synthetic jet actuator. High-speed Schlieren imaging system and phase-locked two-component PIV measurements are used for flowfield characterisation in quiescent conditions. Two actuator configurations with the same exit area but different exit orifice shape (round orifice and slot orifice) are studied. Results indicate a close correspondence between the shapes of the starting vortex ring with the shapes of the respective exit orifices. For the slot orifice, the elongated starting vortex ring gradually expands during propagation, while its ends become warped. A distinct K–H instability structure is observed, inducing continuous oscillation of the high-speed jet. Compared with the jet from the round orifice, the slot jet has a higher entrainment rate of surrounding air, thus resulting in a lower propagation velocity of the jet front. The exit velocity of PSJA within one period initially shows a rapid increase, then persists at a relatively high level (100–130 m/s), and finally drops with some small-scale oscillations. The oscillation amplitude is less than 10 m/s, and the oscillation period is approximately 600 µs. Under conditions of same exit area, orifice shape has little influence on the variation of the exit velocity.","authors":["Haohua Zong"],"meta":["February 2017Experiments in Fluids 58(3):17","DOI:10.1007/s00348-016-2299-1","Project: Plasma synthetic jet actuator"],"references":["305735420_PIV_uncertainty_propagation","281126339_The_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_Actuator_Physics_Modeling_and_Flow_Control_Application_on_Separation","278718082_SparkJet_characterizations_in_quiescent_and_supersonic_flowfields","344845930_Control_of_mean_separation_in_shock_boundary_layer_interaction_using_pulsed_plasma_jets","305644884_Characterisation_of_plasma_synthetic_jet_actuators_in_quiescent_flow","299644462_PIV_and_Electric_Characterization_of_a_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_Actuator","289328394_Development_and_Application_of_the_SparkJet_Actuator_for_High-Speed_Flow_Control","285383865_Influence_of_geometrical_parameters_on_performance_of_plasma_synthetic_jet_actuator","283780405_Influence_of_the_discharge_location_on_the_performance_of_a_three-electrode_plasma_synthetic_jet_actuator","280158950_Transient_ejection_phase_modeling_of_a_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_actuator"]}
