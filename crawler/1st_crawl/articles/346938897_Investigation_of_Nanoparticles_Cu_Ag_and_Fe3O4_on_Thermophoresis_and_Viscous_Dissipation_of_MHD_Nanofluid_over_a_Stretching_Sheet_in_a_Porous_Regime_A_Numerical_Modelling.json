The governing system of PDE’s are reduced to nonlinear ODE’s by the tool of similarity transformations, and are solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with the shooting method via MATLAB. Output of the nanofluid velocity, temperature and concentration for the involved material parameters as well as the correlated engineering physical quantities like coefficient of skin friction and rate of heat transfer are demonstrated via single plots of three nanopartciles and Tables. Heat generation and Soret number for three different nanoparticles play a significant role throughout the investigation. Greater nanoparticle volume fraction declines the liquid velocity, while a non-decline situation has occurred for liquid temperature. Furthermore, the velocity always overshoots for Fe_3 O_4- water nanofluid, followed by Cu and Ag–water nanofluid, whereas the reverse performance is observed for the temperature profiles. An excellent validation of this model is accomplished. The adopted numerical scheme of RK-Shooting is stable and convergent in the same domain throughout the numerical calculations. The proposed investigation shows the importance of three nanoparticles in medical industry and biocompatibility engineering. Also, these nanoparticles can be used in physics, engineering, space technology, high temperature and cooling process, medicines, biosensors, paints, cosmetics, conductive coatings and medical devices.","authors":["Silpi Hazarika","Sahin Ahmed","Ali J.
