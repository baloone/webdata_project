{"id":"254890553_Brzozowski's_Algorithm_CoAlgebraically","abstract":"We give a new presentation of Brzozowski's algorithm to\nminimize nite automata, using elementary facts from universal algebra \nand coalgebra, and building on earlier work by Arbib and Manes on the\nduality between reachability and observability. This leads to a simple\nproof of its correctness and opens the door to further generalizations.","authors":["Filippo Bonchi","Marcello Bonsangue","Jan Rutten","Alexandra Silva"],"meta":["May 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-29485-3_2"],"references":["228382656_Taxonomies_and_toolkits_of_regular_language_algorithms","227187131_Nondeterministic_Moore_Automata_and_Brzozowski's_Algorithm","287236948_Elements_of_Automata_Theory","277296934_Universal_Coalgebra_a_Theory_of_Systems","265316273_Minimization_via_Duality","262425918_Nondeterministic_Moore_automata_and_Brzozowski's_algorithm","262395519_Nondeterministic_Moore_automata_and_Brzozowski's_minimization_algorithm","256720362_On_the_definition_of_a_family_of_automata","240103000_Machines_in_a_category","239041872_Canonical_regular_expressions_and_minimal_state_graphs_for_definite_events"]}
