{"id":"319144435_Secret_sharing_with_optimal_decoding_and_repair_bandwidth","abstract":"This paper studies the communication efficiency of threshold secret sharing schemes. We construct a family of Shamir's schemes with asymptotically optimal decoding bandwidth for arbitrary parameters. We also construct a family of secret sharing schemes with both optimal decoding and optimal repair bandwidth for arbitrary parameters. The construction leads to a family of regenerating codes allowing centralized repair of multiple node failures with small sub-packetization.","authors":["Wentao Huang","Jehoshua Bruck"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006842","Conference: 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)"],"references":["306117716_Staircase_codes_for_secret_sharing_with_optimal_communication_and_read_overheads","301840034_Centralized_Repair_of_Multiple_Node_Failures_With_Applications_to_Communication_Efficient_Secret_Sharing","286513318_Staircase_Codes_for_Secret_Sharing_With_Optimal_Communication_and_Read_Overheads","277333787_Communication_Efficient_Secret_Sharing","224168195_Network_Coding_for_Distributed_Storage_Systems","46584865_Securing_Dynamic_Distributed_Storage_Systems_Against_Eavesdropping_and_Adversarial_Attacks","309574579_Communication_Efficient_Secret_Sharing","306115219_Explicit_constructions_of_MDS_array_codes_and_RS_codes_with_optimal_repair_bandwidth","303901545_Repairing_Reed-solomon_codes","301881066_Explicit_Constructions_of_High-Rate_MDS_Array_Codes_With_Optimal_Repair_Bandwidth","260302636_Optimal_Exact-Regenerating_Codes_for_Distributed_Storage_at_the_MSR_and_MBR_Points_via_a_Product-Matrix_Construction","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","236834714_An_Improved_Sub-Packetization_Bound_for_Minimum_Storage_Regenerating_Codes","224153332_Ideal_perfect_threshold_schemes_and_MDS_codes","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","3086672_On_Secret_Reconstruction_in_Secret_Sharing_Schemes"]}
