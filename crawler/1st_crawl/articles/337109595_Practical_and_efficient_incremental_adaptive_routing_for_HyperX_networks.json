{"id":"337109595_Practical_and_efficient_incremental_adaptive_routing_for_HyperX_networks","abstract":"In efforts to increase performance and reduce cost, modern low-diameter networks are designed for average case traffic and rely on non-minimal adaptive routing for network load-balancing when adversarial traffic patterns are encountered. Source adaptive routing is the predominant method for adaptive routing even though it presents many deficiencies related to making global decisions based solely on local information. In contrast, incremental adaptive routing, which performs an adaptive decision at every hop, is able to increase throughput and reduce latency by overcoming the deficiencies of source adaptive routing. We present two incremental adaptive routing algorithms for HyperX which are the first to be fully implementable in modern high-radix router architectures and interconnection network protocols. Using cycle accurate simulations of a 4,096 node network, our evaluation shows these algorithms are able to exceed the performance of prior work by as much as 4x with synthetic traffic and 25% with 27-point stencil traffic.","authors":["Nie McDonald","Mikhail Isaev","Adriana Flores","Al Davis"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1145/3295500.3356151","Conference: the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis"],"references":["328203031_Recent_advances_in_optical_technologies_for_data_centers_A_review","313341364_Dragonfly_Low_Cost_Topology_for_Scaling_Datacenters","282376532_Slim_Fly_A_Cost_Effective_Low-Diameter_Network_Topology","261313973_On-the-Fly_Adaptive_Routing_in_High-Radix_Hierarchical_Networks","238625662_Principles_and_Practices_of_Interconnection_Network","221658888_Rationale_and_challenges_for_optical_interconnects_to_electronic_chips","220782076_HyperX_Topology_routing_and_packaging_of_efficient_large-scale_networks","220771890_Flattened_butterfly_a_cost-efficient_topology_for_high-radix_networks","220771453_Indirect_adaptive_routing_on_large_scale_interconnection_networks","220090668_Two_algorithms_for_barrier_synchronization","36713359_The_Torus_Routing_Chip","35894074_Load-balanced_routing_in_interconnection_networks","4244660_The_BlackWidow_High-Radix_Clos_Network","4144868_Microarchitecture_of_a_High-Radix_Router","4144847_Near-Optimal_Worst-Case_Throughput_Routing_for_Two-Dimensional_Mesh_Networks","3904516_Route_packets_not_wires_On-chip_interconnection_networks","3410156_Terabus_TerabitSecond-Class_Card-Level_Optical_Interconnect_Technologies","2942456_Route_Packets_Not_Wires_On-Chip_Interconnection_Networks","325422540_SuperSim_Extensible_Flit-Level_Simulation_of_Large-Scale_Interconnection_Networks","325410661_Megafly_A_Topology_for_Exascale_Systems","319390505_Universal_Photonic_Interconnect_for_Data_Centers","314666671_Universal_Photonic_Interconnect_for_Data_Centers","312923347_The_cosmic_cube","310821147_Cost-effective_diameter-two_topologies_analysis_and_evaluation","308320847_Attojoule_Optoelectronics_for_Low-Energy_Information_Processing_and_Communications_a_Tutorial_Review","303636910_An_introduction_to_the_infiniband_architecture","269032024_Flattened_butterfly","254021703_Network_within_a_network_approach_to_create_a_scalable_high-radix_router_microarchitecture","238687215_Fibre_channel_gigabit_communications_and_lo_for_computer_networks","224483264_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Efficient_Solution_of_a_General_Class_of_Recurrence_Equations","221257721_Minimal_Adaptive_Routing_on_the_Mesh_with_Bounded_Queue_Size","220850990_Ethernet_Distributed_Packet_Switching_for_Local_Computer_Networks","220616566_A_Scheme_for_Fast_Parallel_Communication","220426006_The_Cosmic_Cube","220423810_Ethernet_Distributed_Packet_Switching_for_Local_Computer_Networks","4349973_Technology-Driven_Highly-Scalable_Dragonfly_Topology","3791063_The_Turn_Model_for_Adaptive_Routing","3503852_Virtual-Channel_Flow_Control","3300607_A_general_theory_for_deadlock-free_adaptive_routing_using_a_mixedset_of_resources","3299745_New_theory_of_deadlock-free_adaptive_routing_in_wormhole_networks","3234187_Matching_Output_Queueing_With_a_Combined_InputOutput-Queued_Switch","2646760_ROMM_routing_on_mesh_and_torus_networks","2386799_ROMM_Routing_A_Class_of_Efficient_Minimal_Routing_Algorithms","2285018_The_Turn_Model_for_Adaptive_Routing"]}
