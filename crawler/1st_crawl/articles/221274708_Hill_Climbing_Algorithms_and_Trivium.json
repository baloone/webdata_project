{"id":"221274708_Hill_Climbing_Algorithms_and_Trivium","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method to solve certain classes of systems of multivariate equations over the binary field and its\ncryptanalytical applications. We show how heuristic optimization methods such as hill climbing algorithms can be relevant\nto solving systems of multivariate equations. A characteristic of equation systems that may be efficiently solvable by the\nmeans of such algorithms is provided. As an example, we investigate equation systems induced by the problem of recovering\nthe internal state of the stream cipher Trivium. We propose an improved variant of the simulated annealing method that seems\nto be well-suited for this type of system and provide some experimental results.","authors":["Julia Borghoff","Lars Ramkilde Knudsen","Krystian Matusiewicz"],"meta":["August 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-19574-7_4","SourceDBLP","Conference: Selected Areas in Cryptography - 17th International Workshop, SAC 2010, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, August 12-13, 2010, Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["252480439_Linear_Approximations_for_2-round_Trivium","221354932_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Combiners_with_Memory","221348082_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Feedback","221347926_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Solving_Overdefined_Systems_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Equations","220336014_Cryptanalysis_of_Block_Ciphers_with_Overdefined_Systems_of_Equations","220335230_An_Algebraic_Analysis_of_Trivium_Ciphers_based_on_the_Boolean_Satisfiability_Problem","220333274_Two_Trivial_Attacks_on_Trivium","201976924_Correlated_and_Uncorrelated_Fitness_Landscapes_and_How_to_Tell_the_Difference","37811275_The_Origins_of_Order_Self-Organization_and_Selection_in_Evolution","6026283_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing","303170914_Linear_Cryptanalysis_Method_for_DES_Cipher","243659151_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Data_Encryption_Standard_Springer-Verlag","242283769_Algorithms_for_Solving_Overdefined_Systems_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Equations","239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images","228359608_Comparing_and_optimising_two_generic_attacks_on_bivium","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III","224103472_The_Data_Encryption_Standard_DES_and_its_strength_against_attacks","223853267_A_class_of_convergent_generalized_hill_climbing_algorithms","222993378_Thermostatistical_persistency_A_Powerful_Improving_Concept_for_Simulated_Annealing_Algorithms_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_86_565-579","221669680_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributionsand_the_Bayesian_Restoration_of_Images","221347935_Fault_Injection_and_a_Timing_Channel_on_an_Analysis_Technique","221347893_Cryptanalysis_of_an_Identification_Scheme_Based_on_the_Permuted_Perceptron_Problem","220963121_Bivium_as_a_Mixed-Integer_Linear_Programming_Problem","220905129_Trivium_A_Stream_Cipher_Construction_Inspired_by_Block_Cipher_Design_Principles","220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","220114698_Complexity_of_Solving_Algebraic_Equations","220045421_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing","2374008_A_Measure_of_Landscapes"]}
