{"id":"336086193_An_Analysis_on_Extracting_Square_and_Cube_Roots_by_Aryabhata's_Methods","abstract":"Finding accurate root of a number is still considered as challenging in computer science community. The only\npopularly known method to compute root is the long division method of finding square root. Aryabhata contributed two methods\nsimilar to long division method to compute square root and cube root. In recent years, his methods have also been studied,\nexplained and tried to implement as computer algorithms. The explained methods and proposed algorithms fail to give correct\nresults. Some analyses have been made on these methods in order to ascertain why the algorithms fail. Improved algorithms have\nbeen provided to give correct result while computing square root or cube root using Aryabhataâ€™s methods. .","authors":["Yumnam Kirani"],"meta":["September 2019ADBU Journal of Engineering Technology (AJET) 5(2):4"],"references":["295803361_A_new_deterministic_RSA-factoring_algorithm","261832627_A_New_Deterministic_RSA_Factoring_Algorithm","237415858_EXTENDING_THE_BABYLONIAN_ALGORITHM","270547652_Modified_trial_division_algorithm_using_KNJ-factorization_method_to_factorize_RSA_public_key_encryption","267677453_Generalized_trial_division","266597211_Modern_Factoring_Algorithms","234812292_Internet_X509_Public_Key_Infrastructure_Certificate_and_CRL_Profile","224250330_An_Efficient_Method_to_Factorize_the_RSA_Public_Key_Encryption","222306987_Square_Root_Approximations_in_Old_Babylonian_Mathematics_YBC_7289_in_Context","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220137078_ISITRA_A_generalized_way_of_signal_decomposition_and_reconstruction","4193025_Decimal_floating-point_square_root_using_Newton-Raphson_iteration"]}
