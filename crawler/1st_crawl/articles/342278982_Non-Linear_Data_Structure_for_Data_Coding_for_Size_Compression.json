{"id":"342278982_Non-Linear_Data_Structure_for_Data_Coding_for_Size_Compression","abstract":"Data compression is a special case of communication system which is a basic problem in engineering and computer science. In this work, the new scheme has been introduced for data coding to compress the size. Compression by using one type of Non-linear Data-Structure which is Prefix Binary Tree data compression is essential and\nbeneficial in the diversity of application which is embraced in general into two branches: the storage and transmission.the storage of a file in a compressed form takes fewer bit than in uncompressed form, therefore make the most of storage resources (containing main memory itself), and by transmission means sending the files over a channel with reduced number of bits by compression process. This leads to more efficacious transmission process. The compression process of stored data or that to be transmitted leads to significantly reducing both of the storage and transmission. We use text type as a data in the experiments. The results show the compression rate is reduce the actual size above 50%.","authors":["Ashwan Abdulmunem","Ahmed Kasim Hassan","Dunya Jasim Mohammed"],"meta":["June 2020IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 871(1):012011","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/871/1/012011"],"references":["309025726_A_Comparison_of_Data_Compression_Methods_for_Solving_Problems_of_Temperature_Monitoring","277667255_Performance_Analysis_Of_Different_Data_Compression_Techniques_On_Text_File","259624825_The_Data_Compression_Book","256398825_Data_compression_expands","234800201_The_Data_Compression_Book"]}
