{"id":"230883348_On_Cyclic_DNA_Codes","abstract":"This paper considers cyclic DNA codes of arbitrary length over the ring\n$R=\\F_2[u]/u^4-1$. A mapping is given between the elements of $R$ and the\nalphabet $\\{A,C,G,T\\}$ which allows the additive stem distance to be extended\nto this ring. Cyclic codes over $R$ are designed such that their images under\nthe mapping are also cyclic or quasi-cyclic of index 2. The additive distance\nand hybridization energy are functions of the neighborhood energy.","authors":["Kenza Guenda","T.
