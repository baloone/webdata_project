{"id":"271481427_Knowledge-based_evolving_clustering_algorithm_for_data_stream","abstract":"In this paper, we present a knowledge-based evolving algorithm for data stream clustering. The basic idea of the new algorithm is to divide data stream into frames, and to incorporate knowledge learned in previous frames into clustering of the following ones. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the evolving learning mechanism leads to improved clustering results compared with conventional incremental clustering algorithm Fuzzy ART and batch-based clustering algorithm k-means.","authors":["Zhaoyang Sun","Kudo Mao","Wenyin Tang","Lee Onn Mak"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICSSSM.2014.6874031","Conference: 2014 11th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management (ICSSSM)"],"references":["220350595_Collaborative_clustering_with_background_knowledge","3943234_Streaming-data_algorithms_for_high-quality_clustering","2458036_Constrained_K-Means_Clustering","266555943_Constrained_clustering_Advances_in_algorithms_theory_and_applications","222488178_Fuzzy_ART_Fast_Stable_Learning_and_Categorization_of_Analog_Patterns_by_an_Adaptive_Resonance_System","221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","221346515_Clustering_with_Instance-level_Constraints","221310440_A_Framework_for_Clustering_Evolving_Data_Streams","220647351_Fuzzy_clustering_with_a_knowledge-based_guidance","220301504_Clustering_data_stream_A_survey_of_algorithms"]}
