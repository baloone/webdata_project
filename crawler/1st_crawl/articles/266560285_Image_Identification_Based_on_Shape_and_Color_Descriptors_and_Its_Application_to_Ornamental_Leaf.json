{"id":"266560285_Image_Identification_Based_on_Shape_and_Color_Descriptors_and_Its_Application_to_Ornamental_Leaf","abstract":"Hu man has a duty to preserve the nature, preserving the plant is one of the examp les. This research has an emphasis on ornamental plant that has functionality not only as ornament but also as medicine. Although in Indonesia, in general this plant is cultivated in front of the house; only few people know about its med icinal function. Considering this easiness to obtain and its medicinal function, this plant has to be an initial treatment or option towards full chemical-based med icines. This research proposes a system which able to identify properly ornamental plant fro m its leaf utilizing its shape or color features. Shape descriptor represented by Dyadic Wavelet Transformation and Zernike Co mp lex Mo ment, and HSV-based color histogram as color descriptor. This research provides benefit of these three methods to solve various test aspects. It was obtained 81.77% of overall average-testing performance.","authors":["Kohei Aarai","Indra Nugraha Abdullah","Hiroshi Oku"],"meta":["August 2013International Journal of Image, Graphics and Signal Processing 10(10):1-8","DOI:10.5815/ijigsp.2013.10.01"],"references":["240976703_Edge-preserving_Image_Denoising_Method_Based_on_Dyadic_Lifting_Schemes","222528464_A_novel_approach_to_the_fast_computation_of_Zernike_moments","215659315_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","316588757_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","288023219_A_Practical_Guide_to_Support_Vector_Classification","249671873_LIFTING_DYADIC_WAVELETS_FOR_DENOISING","222902977_Utilizing_venation_features_for_efficient_leaf_image_retrieval","222666929_Lu_G_Review_of_Shape_Representation_and_Description_Techniques_Pattern_Recognition_37_1-19","222419115_Classification_of_plant_leaf_images_with_complicated_background","220558722_Leaf_shape_based_plant_species_recognition"]}
