{"id":"220595111_FACTS_A_Framework_for_Fault-Tolerant_Composition_of_Transactional_Web_Services","abstract":"Along with the standardization of Web services composition language and the widespread acceptance of composition technologies, Web services composition is becoming an efficient and cost-effective way to develop modern business applications. As Web services are inherently unreliable, how to deliver reliable Web services composition over unreliable Web services is a significant and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose FACTS, a framework for fault-tolerant composition of transactional Web services. We identify a set of high-level exception handling strategies and a new taxonomy of transactional Web services to devise a fault-tolerant mechanism that combines exception handling and transaction techniques. We also devise a specification module and a verification module to assist service designers to construct fault-handling logic conveniently and correctly. Furthermore, we design an implementation module to automatically implement fault-handling logic in WS-BPEL. A case study demonstrates the viability of our framework and experimental results show that FACTS can improve fault tolerance of composite services with acceptable overheads.","authors":["An Liu","Qing Li","Liusheng Huang","Mingjun Xiao"],"meta":["January 2010IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 3(1):46-59","DOI:10.1109/TSC.2009.28","SourceDBLP"],"references":["264926118_A_Transaction_Model_for_Multidatabase_Systems","249664807_Web_Services_Business_Process_Execution_Language_Version_20","243774856_Transactional_Attitudes_Reliable_Composition_of_Autonomous_Web_Services","232615537_Coordinated_Forward_Error_Recovery_for_CompositeWeb_Services","224646780_Using_WS-BPEL_to_implement_software_fault_tolerance_for_Web_services","221586983_A_Multi-Level_Model_for_Web_Service_Composition","221320203_Building_Reliable_Web_Services_Compositions","221152644_Web_Service_Composition_Transaction_Management","221142258_Compensation_is_Not_Enough","221023890_Investigating_Web_Services_on_the_World_Wide_Web","221022587_Ensuring_Required_Failure_Atomicity_of_Composite_Web_Services","220830749_Methods_for_enabling_recovery_actions_in_Ws-BPEL","220687720_Self-adapting_recovery_nets_for_policy-driven_exception_handling_in_business_processes","220473476_Deploying_and_managing_Web_services_Issues_solutions_and_directions","220473455_FENECIA_Failure_endurable_nested-transaction_based_execution_of_composite_Web_services_with_incorporated_state_analysis","4264678_Deriving_Transactional_Properties_of_CompositeWeb_Services","4082503_A_multilevel_model_for_Web_service_composition","4035550_Compensation_is_not_enough_fault-handling_and_compensation_mechanism","3449335_Basic_Concepts_and_Taxonomy_of_Dependable_and_Secure_Computing","3419633_Web_service_conversation_modeling_A_cornerstone_for_E-business_automation","3419545_Coordinating_business_transactions_on_the_Web","2909394_Automatic_Web_services_composition_using_SHOP2","266650603_Fault_Tolerant_Web_Services_Composition_as_Planning","252064991_Web_Services_Business_Process_Execution_Language_Version_20_OASIS_Standard","242523463_Database_Transaction_Models_for_Advanced_Applications","225962313_Constraints-Aware_Scheduling_for_Transactional_Services_Composition","225960220_Web_Services_and_Business_Transactions","221587202_Augmenting_Web_Services_Composition_with_Transactional_Requirements","221587004_A_Distributed_Replication_Strategy_Evaluation_and_Selection_Framework_for_Fault_Tolerant_Web_Services","220688789_Transactional_Information_Systems_Theory_Algorithms_and_the_Practice_of_Concurrency_Control_and_Recovery","220503412_A_Meta_Modeling_Approach_to_Workflow_Management_Systems_Supporting_Exception_Handling","220225065_Specification_and_Implementation_of_Exceptions_in_Workflow_Management_Systems","220169795_Flexible_provisioning_of_Web_service_workflows","43695269_QoS-Driven_Selection_of_Web_Services_for_Transactional_Composition","4365149_QoS-Aware_Scheduling_of_Web_Services","4264604_A_Declarative_Approach_to_Enhancing_the_Reliability_of_BPEL_Processes","4182279_Policy-driven_exception-management_for_composite_Web_services","3188112_Exception_handling_in_workflow_management_systems","2955996_Orchestration_and_Choreography"]}
