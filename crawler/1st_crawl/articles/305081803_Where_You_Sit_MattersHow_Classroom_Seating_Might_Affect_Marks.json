{"id":"305081803_Where_You_Sit_MattersHow_Classroom_Seating_Might_Affect_Marks","abstract":"In this article we perform a detailed statistical analysis of a large experiment that was carried out in two engineering schools at Universitat Politècnica de València. The goal of the study is to quantify how the distance of students to the professor affects their marks. In the experiment, we collected and processed data about the exact students' position in the lecture hall and in the computer lab for two academic years, their changes of position along the course, and their marks in various degrees, courses, and terms, for both lectures and practicals. Our experiments provide quantitative data that is analyzed using advanced statistical methods such as ANOVA, the TukeyHSD post-hoc test, and the Mantel test based on Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.","authors":["David Insa","Josep Silva","Salvador Tamarit"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2899444","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["262899868_The_Impact_of_Seating_Location_and_Seating_Type_on_Student_Performance","42637312_Classroom_geography_who_sit_where_in_the_traditional_classroom","23978286_Seating_Location_in_Large_Lectures_Are_Seating_Preferences_or_Location_Related_to_Course_Performance","304823625_The_surprising_impact_of_seat_location_on_student_performance","272905237_Eye_Contact_and_Grade_Distribution","243715818_The_Surprising_Impact_of_Seat_Location_on_Student_Performance","232888606_Exploring_the_Formation_of_Groups_Students_Choose_Their_Own_Fate","229180538_Classroom_seating_location_and_its_effect_on_course_achievement_participation_and_attitudes","50841518_Diseno_e_implementacion_de_un_sistema_de_evaluacion_docente","16065882_Recall_of_lecture_information_A_question_of_what_when_and_where"]}
