{"id":"346492283_Institutional_Study_on_Employability_and_Scope_of_Nursing_Graduates_with_Master_of_Arts_Degree_in_Philippines","abstract":"This study examined the employability of the Master of Arts in Nursing (MAN) graduates of Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) from 2004 to 2015. Descriptive research was adapted by the study. Primary data was employed in the study through the use of graduate tracer study survey questionnaire. A total of 159 MAN graduates were the respondents of the study. Frequency count, percentage, weighted mean and rank were used to present the result of information gathered. MAN graduate program is dominated by female and married graduates residing in Camarines Sur. Majority of the respondents were gainfully employed in the country in jobs related to their graduate degree earned. There is a need to enhance the content and coverage of the program for future enrolees. It is recommended to institutionalize the conduct of tracer studies to include not only the graduates but their employers as well and review and upgrade the curricular offering of the graduate degree program to ensure the provision of the competency development programs of the graduates. CSPC may continuously benchmark with other universities and colleges to ensure the competitiveness of its curriculum","authors":["Dulce Atian"],"meta":["September 2020International Journal of Educational Sciences 31(1-3)","DOI:10.31901/24566322.2020/31.1-3.1153"],"references":["331785210_Development_and_Effectiveness_of_a_Textbook_on_Advanced_Mathematics_for_Engineering_Programs","333809181_Development_and_Acceptability_of_the_Simplified_Text_with_Workbook_in_Differential_Equations_as_an_Instructional_Material_for_Engineering","292640914_Employment_and_employability_profile_of_a_select_group_of_Filipino_college_graduates"]}
