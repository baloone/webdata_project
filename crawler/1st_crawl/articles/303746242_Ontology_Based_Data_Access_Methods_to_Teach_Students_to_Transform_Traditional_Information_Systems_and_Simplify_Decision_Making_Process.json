{"id":"303746242_Ontology_Based_Data_Access_Methods_to_Teach_Students_to_Transform_Traditional_Information_Systems_and_Simplify_Decision_Making_Process","abstract":"We describe a service-based approach that provides a natural language interface to legacy information systems, built on top of relational database management systems. The long term goal is to make data management and analysis accessible to a wider range of users for a diverse range of purposes and to simplify the decision making process. We present an ontology-driven web-service, named Reply, that transforms traditional information systems into intelligent systems, endowed with a natural language interface, so that they can be queried by any novice user much like modern day search engines. The principal mechanism of our approach is turning a natural language query into a SQL-query for structured data sources by using Ontology-Based Data Access methods. We also outline how the proposed approach allows semantic searching of large structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data within the database or outside sources, thus helping bridge the talent gap in the case of Big Data Analytics used by researchers and postgraduate students.","authors":["Svetlana Chuprina","Igor Postanogov","Olfa Nasraoui"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 80:1801-1811","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.458","Projects: Web Data MiningOntolis 2.0Information Retrieval"],"references":["314100405_Similarity_Measures_for_Semantic_Relation_Extraction","301659293_Using_ontology-based_adaptable_scientific_visualization_and_cognitive_graphics_tools_to_transform_traditional_information_systems_into_intelligent_systems","277919457_Steps_towards_Bridging_the_HPC_and_Computational_Science_Talent_Gap_Based_on_Ontology_Engineering_Methods","262321099_A_study_of_hybrid_similarity_measures_for_semantic_relation_extraction","221510776_Ontologies_and_Databases_The_DL-Lite_Approach","221350071_Conceptual_Modeling_for_Data_Integration","312721366_How_Semantic_Technologies_Can_Enhance_Data_Access_at_Siemens_Energy","309113993_Frontiers_in_massive_data_analysis","256660328_BabelNet_The_automatic_construction_evaluation_and_application_of_a_wide-coverage_multilingual_semantic_network","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications"]}
