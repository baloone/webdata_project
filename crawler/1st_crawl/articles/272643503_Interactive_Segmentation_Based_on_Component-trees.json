{"id":"272643503_Interactive_Segmentation_Based_on_Component-trees","abstract":"Component-trees associate to a discrete gray-level image a descriptive data structure induced by the inclusion relation between the binary components obtained at successive level-sets. This article presents an interactive segmentation methodology based on component-trees. It consists of the extraction of a subset of the image component-tree, enabling the generation of a binary object which fits at best (with respect to the gray-level structure of the image) a given binary target selected beforehand in the image. Compared to other interactive segmentation methods, the proposed methodology has the following advantages: (i) the segmentation result is only composed of a union of connected components of the level-sets, which ensures that no 'false contours' are included; (ii) only one image marker is needed: in particular, there is no need to give a marker for the background (contrary to some other methods); (iii) the method is fast and efficient, leading to a result computed in real-time on common image sizes.","authors":["Beno√Æt Naegel","Nicolas Passat"],"meta":["May 2014Image Processing On Line 4:89-97","DOI:10.5201/ipol.2014.71"],"references":["6720916_Building_the_Component_Tree_in_Quasi-Linear_Time","5576304_Antiextensive_connected_operators_for_image_and_sequence_processing","2443372_Anti-extensive_Connected_Operators_for_Image_and_Sequence_Processing","222647747_A_comparative_evaluation_of_interactive_segmentation_algorithms","220604038_Interactive_segmentation_based_on_component-trees"]}
