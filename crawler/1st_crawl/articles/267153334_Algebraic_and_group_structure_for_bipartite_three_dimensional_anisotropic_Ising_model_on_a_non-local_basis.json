Interactions able to generate and sustain\nentanglement are subject to deep research in order to have understanding and control on it,\nbased on speci�c physical systems. Atoms, ions or quantum dots are considered a key piece in quantum\napplications because is a basic piece of developments towards a scalable spin-based quantum\ncomputer through universal and basic quantum operations. Ising model is a type of interaction\nwhich generates and modi�es entanglement properties of quantum systems based on matter. In this\nwork, a general anisotropic three dimensional Ising model including an inhomogeneous magnetic\n�eld is analyzed to obtain their evolution and then, their algebraic properties which are controlled\nthrough a set of physical parameters. Evolution denote remarkable group properties when is analyzed\nin a non local basis, in particular those related with entangl","authors":["Francisco Javier Delgado-Cepeda"],"meta":["October 2014International Journal of Quantum Information 13(7)","DOI:10.1142/S0219749915500550","Project: SU(2) reduction of multipartite two level systems"],"references":["254848870_Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff_relation_for_special_unitary_groups_SUN","272161453_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_ferromagnetism","266438695_Introduction_to_Quantum_Control_and_Dynamics","265435183_Group_theory_in_physics_An_introduction_Rev_and_abridged_ed","263796292_CLASSICAL_AND_QUANTUM_CONTROL_OF_A_SIMPLE_QUANTUM_SYSTEM","263676425_NMR_Quantum_Information_Processing_Experimental_Aspects_of_Quantum_Computing","258091016_Nonlinear_Field_Theory_of_Large-Spin_Heisenberg_Antiferromagnets_Semiclassically_Quantized_Solitons_of_the_One-Dimensional_Easy-Axis_Nel_State","256584235_Continuum_dynamics_of_the_1-D_Heisenberg_antiferromagnet_Identification_with_the_O3_nonlinear_sigma_model","253843736_History_of_the_Lenz-Ising_Model","243390470_Group_Theory_in_Physics_An_Introduction"]}
