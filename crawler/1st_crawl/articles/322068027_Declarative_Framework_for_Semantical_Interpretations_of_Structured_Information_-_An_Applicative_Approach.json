{"id":"322068027_Declarative_Framework_for_Semantical_Interpretations_of_Structured_Information_-_An_Applicative_Approach","abstract":"We study the applicability of declarative models to encode and describe structured information by means of semantics. Specifically, we introduce D-SPACES, an implementation of constraint systems with space and extrusion operators. Constraint systems are algebraic models that allow for a semantic language-like representation of information in systems where the concept of space is a primary structural feature. We mainly give this information an epistemic or temporal interpretation and consider various agents as entities acting upon it. D-SPACES is coded as a c++ library providing implementations of constraint systems, space functions and extrusion functions. The interfaces to access each implementation are minimal and thoroughly documented. D-SPACES also provides property-checking methods as well as an implementation of a specific type of constraint systems (a boolean algebra). This last implementation serves as an entry point for quick access and proof of concept when using these models. Finally, we show the applicability of this framework with two examples; a scenario in the form of a social network where users post their beliefs and utter their opinions, and a semantical interpretation of a logical language to express time behaviors and properties.","authors":["Stefan Haar","Salim Perchy","Frank D.
