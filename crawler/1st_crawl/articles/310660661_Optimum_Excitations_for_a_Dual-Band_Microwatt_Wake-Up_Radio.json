{"id":"310660661_Optimum_Excitations_for_a_Dual-Band_Microwatt_Wake-Up_Radio","abstract":"To enable pervasive exploitation of wireless sensor networks, semipassive wake-up radios (WuRs) are proposed to minimize the active time of the energy-hungry main communication radio. The most challenging feature is to enhance their sensitivity, the weakest activation signal the receiver is able to sense, which is limited by the minimum turn-on voltage of the diode-based detector. In order to operate the detector at even lower power levels, a strategy to optimize the modulated WuR excitations is presented, exploiting high-peak intermittent continuous waves while preserving the required average power per bit. The design and implementation of an ultralow-power detector, fed by a dual-band antenna and loaded by the WuR backend is presented: 2.45-GHz and 868-MHz operations of the same WuR are demonstrated, with added flexibility and interoperability among different communication bands. We show that a correct WuR activation is possible with an average power per bit as low as -63 dBm at 2.45 GHz and -65 dBm at 868 MHz. This is experimentally verified by a lab-level setup and confirmed by a system implementation based on off-the-shelf components only.","authors":["Massimo del prete","Alessandra Costanzo","Michele Magno","Diego Masotti"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques PP(99):1-9","DOI:10.1109/TMTT.2016.2622699","Project: Wake Up Radio and Energy efficient Communication"],"references":["293191680_Design_implementation_and_performance_evaluation_of_a_flexible_low_latency_and_low_cost_nano-Watt_Wake-Up_Radio_Receiver","289090000_An_ultra_low_power_high_sensitivity_wake-up_radio_receiver_with_addressing_capability","270882955_Ambient_RF_Energy-Harvesting_Technologies_for_Self-Sustainable_Standalone_Wireless_Sensor_Platforms","264387657_Benefits_of_Wake-Up_Radio_in_Energy-Efficient_Multimodal_Surveillance_Wireless_Sensor_Network","224440831_Power-optimized_waveforms_for_improving_the_range_and_reliability_of_RFID_systems","306264326_A_24_GHz-868_MHz_dual-band_wake-up_radio_for_wireless_sensor_network_and_IoT","306116173_Experimental_analysis_of_power_optimized_waveforms_for_enhancing_wake-up_radio_sensitivity","299644141_A_dual-band_wake-up_radio_for_ultra-low_power_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","284921200_Analysis_of_rectifier_RF-DC_power_conversion_behavior_with_QPSK_and_16QAM_input_signals_for_WiCoPT_system","276119238_Theoretical_Energy-Conversion_Efficiency_for_Energy-Harvesting_Circuits_Under_Power-Optimized_Waveform_Excitation","273397422_Electromagnetic_Energy_Harvesting_and_Wireless_Power_Transmission_A_Unified_Approach","273395345_Boosting_the_Efficiency_Unconventional_Waveform_Design_for_Efficient_Wireless_Power_Transfer","271496901_Rectenna_performance_under_power-optimized_waveform_excitation","261200621_A_fully-autonomous_integrated_RF_energy_harvesting_system_for_wearable_applications","260545019_Extending_Reading_Range_of_Commercial_RFID_Readers","224212169_System-Oriented_Harmonic-Balance_Algorithms_for_Circuit-Level_Simulation","4344143_An_Experimental_Study_of_Passive_UHF_RFID_System_with_Longer_Communication_Range","3984044_Comparison_of_Single_Diode_Vs_Dual_Diode_Detectors_for_Microwave_Power_Detection"]}
