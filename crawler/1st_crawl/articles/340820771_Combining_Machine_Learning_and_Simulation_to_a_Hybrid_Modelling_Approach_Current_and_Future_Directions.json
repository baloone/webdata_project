{"id":"340820771_Combining_Machine_Learning_and_Simulation_to_a_Hybrid_Modelling_Approach_Current_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"In this paper, we describe the combination of machine learning and simulation towards a hybrid modelling approach. Such a combination of data-based and knowledge-based modelling is motivated by applications that are partly based on causal relationships, while other effects result from hidden dependencies that are represented in huge amounts of data. Our aim is to bridge the knowledge gap between the two individual communities from machine learning and simulation to promote the development of hybrid systems. We present a conceptual framework that helps to identify potential combined approaches and employ it to give a structured overview of different types of combinations using exemplary approaches of simulation-assisted machine learning and machine-learning assisted simulation. We also discuss an advanced pairing in the context of Industry 4.0 where we see particular further potential for hybrid systems.","authors":["Laura von Rueden","Sebastian Mayer","Rafet Sifa","Christian Bauckhage"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-44584-3_43","Conference: International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA)","Project: Informed Learning - Simulation-based Learning"],"references":["339462248_Explainable_Machine_Learning_for_Scientific_Insights_and_Discoveries","335242831_Sim-to-real_transfer_reinforcement_learning_for_control_of_thermal_effects_of_an_atmospheric_pressure_plasma_jet","334844488_Deeper_Connections_between_Neural_Networks_and_Gaussian_Processes_Speed-up_Active_Learning","333262620_Machine_Learning_in_High_Energy_Physics_Community_White_Paper","328386182_Machine_Learning_in_High_Energy_Physics_Community_White_Paper","349547895_Natural_catastrophe_risk_management_and_modelling_A_practitioner's_guide","341763957_The_frontier_of_simulation-based_inference","339479685_Machine_Learning_for_Molecular_Simulation","331089977_Deep_learning_and_process_understanding_for_data-driven_Earth_system_science","328457601_Simulation-based_Adversarial_Test_Generation_for_Autonomous_Vehicles_with_Machine_Learning_Components"]}
