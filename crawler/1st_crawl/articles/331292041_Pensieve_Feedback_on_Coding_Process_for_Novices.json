{"id":"331292041_Pensieve_Feedback_on_Coding_Process_for_Novices","abstract":"In large undergraduate computer science classrooms, student learning on assignments is often gauged only by the work on their final solution, not by their programming process. As a consequence, teachers are unable to give detailed feedback on how students implement programming methodology, and novice students often lack a metacognitive understanding of how they learn. We introduce Pensieve as a drag-and-drop, open-source tool that organizes snapshots of student code as they progress through an assignment. The tool is designed to encourage sit-down conversations between student and teacher about the programming process. The easy visualization of code evolution over time facilitates the discussion of intermediate work and progress towards learning goals, both of which would otherwise be unapparent from a single final submission. This paper discusses the pedagogical foundations and technical details of Pensieve and describes results from a particular 207-student classroom deployment, suggesting that the tool has meaningful impacts on education for both the student and the teacher.","authors":["Lisa Yan","Annie Hu","Chris Piech"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1145/3287324.3287483","Conference: the 50th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["326917999_Metacognitive_Difficulties_Faced_by_Novice_Programmers_in_Automated_Assessment_Tools","305081685_Towards_a_Systematic_Review_of_Automated_Feedback_Generation_for_Programming_Exercises","283468835_Data-Driven_Hint_Generation_in_Vast_Solution_Spaces_a_Self-Improving_Python_Programming_Tutor","349860897_Item_Response_Theory","331289476_The_PyramidSnapshot_Challenge_Understanding_Student_Process_from_Visual_Output_of_Programs","323329722_TMOSS_Using_Intermediate_Assignment_Work_to_Understand_Excessive_Collaboration_in_Large_Classes","316945607_Sharing_and_Using_Programming_Log_Data_Abstract_Only","313968065_Item_Response_Theory","301935081_Programming_Problem_Solving_and_Self-Awareness_Effects_of_Explicit_Guidance","291596997_Most_difficult_topics_in_CS1"]}
