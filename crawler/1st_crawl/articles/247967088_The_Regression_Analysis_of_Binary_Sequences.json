{"id":"247967088_The_Regression_Analysis_of_Binary_Sequences","abstract":"A sequence of 0's and 1's is observed and it is suspected that the chance that a particular trial is a 1 depends on the value of one or more independent variables. Tests and estimates for such situations are considered, dealing first with problems in which the independent variable is preassigned and then with independent variables that are functions of the sequence. There is a considerable amount of earlier work, which is reviewed.","authors":["David Cox"],"meta":["July 1958Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
