{"id":"2366860_An_Evaluation_of_Negative_Selection_in_an_Artificial_Immune_System_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection","abstract":"This paper investigates the role of negative selection in an artificial immune system (AIS) for network intrusion detection. The work focuses on the use of negative selection as a network traffic anomaly detector. The results of the negative selection algorithm experiments show a severe scaling problem for handling real network traffic data. The paper concludes by suggesting that the most appropriate use of negative selection in the AIS is as a filter for invalid detectors, not the generation of competent detectors. 1","authors":["Jungwon Kim","Peter J.
