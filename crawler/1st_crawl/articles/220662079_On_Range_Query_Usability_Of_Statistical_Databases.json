{"id":"220662079_On_Range_Query_Usability_Of_Statistical_Databases","abstract":"A statistical database is said to be secure if no sensitive statistics are disclosed. An important problem in security of statistical databases is to maximize the number of disclosed statistics, while ensuring that the database is secure. In this paper we present a new result for the case of range queries in 1-dimensional statistical databases and k -compromise, where k is odd.","authors":["Ljiljana Brankovic","Mirka Miller","Jozef Siran"],"meta":["January 2002International Journal of Computer Mathematics 79(12):1265-1271","DOI:10.1080/00207160214651","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265880851_An_application_of_combinatorics_to_the_security_of_statistical_databases","265818586_Graphs_0-1_matrices_and_usability_of_statistical_databases","221152697_Towards_a_Practical_Auditing_Method_for_the_Prevention_of_Statistical_Database_Compromise","220722510_A_Complex_Approach_to_the_Security_of_Statistical_Databases_Subject_to_Off-line_Sum_Queries","220569234_A_Combinatorial_Problem_in_Database_Security","220565983_Security-Control_Methods_for_Statistical_Databases_A_Comparative_Study","220532754_An_Optimization_Problem_in_Statistical_Databases","220148934_Efficient_Inference_Control_for_Range_SUM_Queries","12595557_Vestibulopathic_gait_You're_better_off_running_than_walking","3189560_Auditing_and_Inference_Control_in_Statistical_Databases","2778593_Graphs_0-1_Matrices_and_Usability_of_Statistical_Databases","2775203_Concentrating_Subset_Sums_at_k_Points","2646854_Database_Security_and_the_Distribution_of_Subset_Sums_in_R_m"]}
