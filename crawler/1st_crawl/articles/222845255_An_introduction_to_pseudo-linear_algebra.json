{"id":"222845255_An_introduction_to_pseudo-linear_algebra","abstract":"Pseudo-linear algebra is the study of common properties of linear differential and difference operators. We introduce in this paper its basic objects (pseudo-derivations, skew polynomials, and pseudo-linear operators) and describe several recent algorithms on them, which, when applied in the differential and difference cases, yield algorithms for uncoupling and solving systems of linear differential and difference equations in closed form.","authors":["Manuel Bronstein","Marko Petkovsek"],"meta":["February 1970Theoretical Computer Science 157(1):3-33","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(95)00173-5"],"references":["284650872_Rational_solutions_of_linear_differential_and_difference_equations_with_polynomial_coefficients","242468317_On_some_problems_in_factorization_of_linear_ordinary_differential_operators","2735118_Numerical_Solution_of_a_Secular_Equation","267334617_Free_Rings_and_their_Relations","242619135_Theory_of_Non-Commutative_Polynomials","242530041_Linear_operators_and_factorisation","238881163_Ein_Satz_uber_die_Zerlegung_homogener_linearer_Differentialausdrucke_in_irreductible_Factoren","238872796_Rings_With_a_Weak_Algorithm","223113524_Hypergeometric_solutions_of_linear_recurrences_with_polynomial_coefficients","222379175_On_solutions_of_linear_ordinary_differential_equations_in_their_coefficient_field","220161277_Hypergeometric_Solutions_of_Linear_Recurrences_with_Polynomial_Coefficents","7192174_On_Pseudo-Linear_Transformations","2610036_Linear_Ordinary_Differential_Equations_breaking_through_the_order_2_barrier"]}
