{"id":"309956010_Experimental_demonstration_of_anomalous_Floquet_topological_insulator_for_sound","abstract":"Time-reversal invariant topological insulator is widely recognized as one of the fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics, for which the most fascinating hallmark is perhaps a spin-based topological protection, the absence of scattering of conduction electrons with certain spins on matter surface. Recently, it has created a paradigm shift for topological insulators, from electronics to photonics, phononics and mechanics as well, bringing about not only involved new physics but also potential applications in robust wave transport. Despite the growing interests in topologically protected acoustic wave transport, T-invariant acoustic topological insulator has not yet been achieved. Here we report experimental demonstration of anomalous Floquet topological insulator for sound: a strongly coupled metamaterial ring lattice that supports one-way propagation of pseudo-spin-dependent edge states under T-symmetry. We also demonstrate the formation of pseudo-spin-dependent interface states due to lattice dislocations and investigate the properties of pass band and band gap states.","authors":["Yu-Gui Peng","Cheng-Zhi Qin","Lu Rong-de","Ya-Xi Shen"],"meta":["November 2016Nature Communications 7(1):13368","DOI:10.1038/ncomms13368"],"references":["303424134_Implementation_of_dispersion-free_slow_acoustic_wave_propagation_and_phase_engineering_with_helical-structured_metamaterials","303374341_ARTICLE_Probing_topological_protection_using_a_designer_surface_plasmon_structure","301483775_Photonic_topological_insulator_with_broken_time-reversal_symmetry","282904714_Topologically_robust_sound_propagation_in_an_angular-momentum-biased_graphene-like_resonator_lattice","276413043_Topologically_protected_one-way_edge_mode_in_networks_of_acoustic_resonators_with_circulating_air_flow","275669814_Probing_the_limits_of_topological_protection_in_a_designer_surface_plasmon_structure","275055303_Topological_mechanics_of_gyroscopic_metamaterials","274394409_Topological_Acoustics","283914048_Synthetic_gauge_flux_and_Weyl_points_in_acoustic_systems","274730683_Topological_Phononic_Crystals_with_One-Way_Elastic_Edge_Waves"]}
