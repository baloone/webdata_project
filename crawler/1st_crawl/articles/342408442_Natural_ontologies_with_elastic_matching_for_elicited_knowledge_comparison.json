{"id":"342408442_Natural_ontologies_with_elastic_matching_for_elicited_knowledge_comparison","abstract":"Natural Ontologies are presented in this work as a useful tool to model the way in which concepts are organized inside the human mind. In order to be compared, ontologies are represented as matrices and an elastic matching technique is used. For this purpose, a distance measure called Modern Fréchet is proposed, which is an approximation to the NP-Complete problem of elastic matching between matrices. An applied case of study is presented in which human knowledge is compared among different groups of people in the Computer Science domain.","authors":["Hiram Calvo","J Figueroa-Nazuno","Ángel Mandujano"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 39(3):1-13","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-179891"],"references":["262325410_A_survey_of_elastic_matching_techniques_for_handwritten_character_recognition_IEICE_Trans_Inf_Syst_E88-D81781-1790","252979701_A_Survey_of_Ontology_Learning_Approaches","251070853_Conceptualizacion_de_los_Estudiantes_sobre_el_Buen_Profesor_Universitario_en_las_Carreras_de_la_Salud_de_la_Universidad_de_La_Frontera_-_Chile","285274615_Una_aproximacion_al_problema_del_significado_Las_redes_semanticas","262343503_A_Graph_Derivation_Based_Approach_for_Measuring_and_Comparing_Structural_Semantics_of_Ontologies","258548987_Developing_Matlab_scripts_for_image_analysis_and_quality_assessment","243074330_On_the_foundations_of_the_calcul_fonctionnel_of_Frechet","225407302_Sur_Quelques_Points_du_Calcul_Functionnel","225255704_An_approach_to_the_problem_of_meaning_Semantic_networks","224825463_Computing_the_Discrete_Fr'echet_Distance_in_Subquadratic_Time","220195673_A_novel_algorithm_for_ontology_matching","222561736_Elastic_image_matching_is_NP-complete","221328485_An_Asymmetric_Similarity_Measure_for_Ontologies_Based_on_the_Feature_Contrast_Model","220843610_Computing_Similarity_Among_3D_Objects_Using_Dynamic_Time_Warping","28059634_Redes_semanticas_de_los_conceptos_de_presion_y_flotacion_en_estudiantes_de_bachillerato"]}
