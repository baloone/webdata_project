{"id":"333865436_Slopes_of_Multidimensional_Subshifts","abstract":"In this paper we study the directions of periodicity of multidimensional subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and of multidimensional effectively closed and sofic subshifts. A configuration of a subshift has a slope of periodicity if it is periodic in exactly one direction, the slope representing that direction. In this paper, we prove that Σ10 sets of non-commensurable ℤ2 vectors are exactly the sets of slopes of 2D SFTs and that Σ20 sets of non-commensurable vectors are exactly the sets of slopes of 3D SFTs, and exactly the sets of slopes of 2D and 3D sofic and effectively closed subshifts.","authors":["Emmanuel Jeandel","Etienne Moutot","Pascal Vanier"],"meta":["January 2020Theory of Computing Systems 64(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-019-09931-1"],"references":["257506866_Simulation_of_Effective_Subshifts_by_Two-dimensional_Subshifts_of_Finite_Type","256981966_Structuring_multi-dimensional_subshifts","242949311_Remarks_on_Berger's_paper_on_the_domino_problem","235892554_Characterizations_of_periods_of_multidimensional_shifts","324724498_Slopes_of_3-Dimensional_Subshifts_of_Finite_Type","312449310_An_aperiodic_set_of_wang_cubes","279068736_An_aperiodic_set_of_11_Wang_tiles","251190758_Growth-type_invariants_for_Z_d_subshifts_of_finite_type_and_arithmetical_classes_of_real_numbers","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem","230641324_An_Introduction_to_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Coding","226606019_Undecidability_and_Nonperiodicity_for_Tilings_of_the_Plane","225977813_On_the_dynamics_and_recursive_properties_of_multidimensional_symbolic_systems","222343634_A_small_aperiodic_set_of_Wang_tiles","220617732_The_Nilpotency_Problem_of_One-Dimensional_Cellular_Automata","220544485_Endomorphisms_and_Automorphisms_of_the_Shift_Dynamical_Systems"]}
