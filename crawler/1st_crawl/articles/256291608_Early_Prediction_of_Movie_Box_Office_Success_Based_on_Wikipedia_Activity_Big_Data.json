{"id":"256291608_Early_Prediction_of_Movie_Box_Office_Success_Based_on_Wikipedia_Activity_Big_Data","abstract":"Use of socially generated \"big data\" to access information about collective states of the minds in human societies has become a new paradigm in the emerging field of computational social science. A natural application of this would be the prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However, bridging the gap between \"real time monitoring\" and \"early predicting\" remains a big challenge. Here we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users. We show that the popularity of a movie can be predicted much before its release by measuring and analyzing the activity level of editors and viewers of the corresponding entry to the movie in Wikipedia, the well-known online encyclopedia.","authors":["Márton Mestyán","Taha Yasseri","János Kertész"],"meta":["August 2013PLoS ONE 8(8):e71226","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0071226","SourcePubMed"],"references":["286021836_Correction_Can_Tweets_Predict_Citations_Metrics_of_Social_Impact_Based_on_Twitter_and_Correlation_with_Traditional_Metrics_of_Scientific_Impact","262401833_Predicting_IMDB_Movie_Ratings_Using_Social_Media","262238164_Extracting_Event-Related_Information_from_Article_Updates_in_Wikipedia","257073877_CORRIGENDUM_Quantitative_analysis_of_the_evolution_of_novelty_in_cinema_through_crowdsourced_keywords","256018655_What_We_Know_About_Wikipedia_A_Review_of_the_Literature_Analyzing_the_Projects","313618143_Predicting_movie_sales_from_blogger_sentiment","266889131_Bieber_no_more_First_Story_Detection_using_Twitter_and_Wikipedia","258302473_The_'hit'_phenomenon_A_mathematical_model_of_human_dynamics_interactions_as_a_stochastic_process","256035948_The_Web_Mirrors_Value_in_the_Real_World_-_Comparing_a_Firm's_Valuation_with_Its_Web_Network_Position","256031115_Wikipedia_Research_and_Tools_Review_and_Comments","237053772_Characterizing_the_Life_Cycle_of_Online_News_Stories_Using_Social_Media_Reactions","236935492_The_Most_Controversial_Topics_in_Wikipedia_A_Multilingual_and_Geographical_Analysis","236653998_Quantifying_Wikipedia_Usage_Patterns_Before_Stock_Market_Moves","235893798_Opinions_Conflicts_and_Consensus_Modeling_Social_Dynamics_in_a_Collaborative_Environment","233789826_A_Practical_Approach_to_Language_Complexity_A_Wikipedia_Case_Study"]}
