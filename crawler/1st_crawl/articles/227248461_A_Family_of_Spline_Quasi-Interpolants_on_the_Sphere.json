{"id":"227248461_A_Family_of_Spline_Quasi-Interpolants_on_the_Sphere","abstract":"In this paper, we construct a local quasi-interpolant Q for fitting a function f defined on the sphere S. We first map the surface S onto a rectangular domain and next, by using the tensor product of polynomial splines and 2-periodic trigonometric splines, we give the expression of Qf. The use of trigonometric splines is necessary to enforce some boundary conditions which are useful to ensure the C\n2 continuity of the associated surface. Finally, we prove that Q realizes an accuracy of optimal order.","authors":["Otheman Nouisser","D.
