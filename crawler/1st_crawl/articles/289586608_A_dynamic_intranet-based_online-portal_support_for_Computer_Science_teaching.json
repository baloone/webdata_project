{"id":"289586608_A_dynamic_intranet-based_online-portal_support_for_Computer_Science_teaching","abstract":"The paper is a suggested experiment in effectively teaching subjects in Computer Science. The paper addresses effective content-delivery with the help of a university intranet. The proposal described herein is for teaching a subject like Combinatorics and Graph Theory - the main idea is to supplement lectures with a teacher-moderated online forum against an associated intranet portal. Keywords and phrases -computer-assisted learning; learning portal; active learning; OEIS; intranet portal; undergraduate teaching; Combinatorics and Graph theory","authors":["Viswanathan K.
