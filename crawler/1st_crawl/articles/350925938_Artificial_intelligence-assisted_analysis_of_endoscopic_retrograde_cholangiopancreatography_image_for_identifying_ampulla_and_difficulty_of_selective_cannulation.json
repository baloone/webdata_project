{"id":"350925938_Artificial_intelligence-assisted_analysis_of_endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography_image_for_identifying_ampulla_and_difficulty_of_selective_cannulation","abstract":"The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has facilitated its application in medical fields. However, there has been little research for AI-assisted endoscopy, despite the clinical significance of the efficiency and safety of cannulation in the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In this study, we aim to assist endoscopists performing ERCP through automatic detection of the ampulla and the identification of cannulation difficulty. We developed a novel AI-assisted system based on convolutional neural networks that predict the location of the ampulla and the difficulty of cannulation to the ampulla. ERCP data of 531 and 451 patients were utilized in the evaluation of our model for each task. Our model detected the ampulla with mean intersection-over-union 64.1%, precision 76.2%, recall 78.4%, and centroid distance 0.021. In classifying the cannulation difficulty, it achieved the recall of 71.9% for the class of easy cases and that of 61.1% for that of difficult cases. Remarkably, our model accurately detected AOV with varying morphological shape, size, and texture on par with the level of a human expert and showed promising results for recognizing cannulation difficulty. It demonstrated its potential to improve the quality of ERCP by assisting endoscopists.","authors":["Taesung Kim","Jinhee Kim","Hyuk Soon Choi","Eun Sun Kim"],"meta":["April 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):8381","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-87737-3"],"references":["336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","332165523_Survey_on_deep_learning_with_class_imbalance","331565658_Deep_Neural_Networks_Outperform_Human_Expert's_Capacity_in_Characterizing_Bioleaching_Bacterial_Biofilm_Composition","330424615_Difficult_biliary_cannulation_Historical_perspective_practical_updates_and_guide_for_the_endoscopist","340369842_Automatic_detection_of_tympanic_membrane_and_middle_ear_infection_from_oto-endoscopic_images_via_convolutional_neural_networks","339355771_Automatic_detection_and_classification_of_protruding_lesions_in_wireless_capsule_endoscopy_images_based_on_a_deep_convolutional_neural_network","338962150_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","338514531_A_Style-Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","332373504_A_deep_neural_network_improves_endoscopic_detection_of_early_gastric_cancer_without_blind_spots","329743528_StarGAN_Unified_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Multi-domain_Image-to-Image_Translation"]}
