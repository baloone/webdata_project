{"id":"225149670_Playing_Games_with_Algorithms_Algorithmic_Combinatorial_Game_Theory","abstract":"Combinatorial games lead to several interesting, clean problems in algorithms and complexity theory, many of which remain\nopen. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the area to encourage further research. In particular, we begin\nwith general background in combinatorial game theory, which analyzes ideal play in perfect-information games. Then we survey\nresults about the complexity of determining ideal play in these games, and the related problems of solving puzzles, in terms\nof both polynomial-time algorithms and computational intractability results. Our review of background and survey of algorithmic\nresults are by no means complete, but should serve as a useful primer.","authors":["Erik D.
