This critiquing tool\nis embedded in a suite named AMADEUS that caters for various needs of\nnon-native English users to produce a first draft of a paper, relying on\nthe reuse of contextualized linguistic material as input for the user.\nOur emphasis is on the architecture and methodology to build the\nlinguistic resources for the critiquing tool. Though originally targeted\nat non-native authors, the critiquing tool may also be useful for novice\nnative English writers and as a teaching resource for English for\nAcademic Purposes practitioners","authors":["Sandra M.
