{"id":"281611336_A_Helly_theorem_in_weakly_modular_space","abstract":"The d-convex sets in a metric space are those subsets which include the metric interval between any two of its elements. Weak modularity is a certain interval property for triples of points. The d-convexity of a discrete weakly modular space X coincides with the geodesic convexity of the graph formed by the two-point intervals in X. The Helly number of such a space X turns out to be the same as the clique number of the associated graph. This result thus entails a Helly theorem for quasi-median graphs, pseudo-modular graphs, and bridged graphs.","authors":["H.-J.
