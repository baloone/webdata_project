{"id":"348677883_Neutrosophic_Bitopological_Spaces","abstract":"In this study, bitopological structure which is a more general structure than topological spaces is built on neutrosophic sets. The necessary arguments which are pairwise neutrosophic open set, pairwise neutrosophic closed set, pairwise neutrosophic closure, pairwise neutrosophic interior are defined and their basic properties are presented. The relations of these concepts with their counterparts in neutrosophic topological spaces are given and many examples are presented.","authors":["Taha Yasin Ozturk","Alkan Ozkan"],"meta":["January 2019"],"references":["340915464_ON_Neutrosophic_Crisp_Supra_Bi-Topological_Spaces","333558471_An_Integrated_Neutrosophic-TOPSIS_Approach_and_Its_Application_to_Personnel_Selection_A_New_Trend_in_Brain_Processing_and_Analysis","330499777_Separation_axioms_on_neutrosophic_soft_topological_spaces","316797407_On_Separation_Axioms_in_an_Ordered_Neutrosophic_Bitopological_Space","308790060_Neutrosophic_soft_relations_and_some_properties","308789966_Weighted_Neutrosophic_Soft_Sets","332549253_A_study_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_supra_topological_spaces","332161506_Neutrosophic_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Approach_for_IoT-Based_Enterprises","326422704_On_neutrosophic_soft_function","315931150_Introduction_to_neutrosophic_soft_topological_space"]}
