{"id":"344903069_Hyperplane_arrangement_cohomology_and_monomials_in_the_exterior_algebra","abstract":"We show that if X X is the complement of a complex hyperplane arrangement, then the homology of X X has linear free resolution as a module over the exterior algebra on the first cohomology of X X . We study invariants of X X that can be deduced from this resolution. A key ingredient is a result of Aramova, Avramov, and Herzog (2000) on resolutions of monomial ideals in the exterior algebra. We give a new conceptual proof of this result.","authors":["David Eisenbud","Sorin Popescu","Sergey Yuzvinsky"],"meta":["July 2003Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 355(11):4365-4383","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9947-03-03292-6"],"references":["245695987_Combinatorial_Stratification_of_Complex_Arrangements","231965582_Characteristic_varieties_of_arrangements","231884838_On_multigraded_resolutions","225834395_Arrangements_and_cohomology","225160280_On_the_difference_between_real_and_complex_arrangements","2575538_Cohomology_of_the_Orlik-Solomon_Algebras_and_Local_Systems","2140937_Cohomology_rings_and_nilpotent_quotients_of_real_and_complex_arrangements","344497706_Resolutions_of_monomial_ideals_and_cohomology_over_exterior_algebras","321507344_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","268652213_The_homology_and_shellability_of_matroids_and_geometric_lattices","265431504_Cohen-Macaulay_rings_combinatorics_and_simplicial_complexes","264958033_Rings_of_Invariants_of_Tori_Cohen-Macaulay_Rings_Generated_by_Monomials_and_Polytopes","248549097_Cohen-Macaulay_rings_and_constructible_polytopes","245849354_Decompositions_of_Simplicial_Complexes_Related_to_Diameters_of_Convex_Polyhedra","243782831_A_higher_invariant_for_matroids","242505554_Commutative_Algebra_with_a_View_Toward_Algebraic_Geometry","226523628_Combinatorics_and_topology_of_complements_of_hyperplanes","225589871_On_the_homology_of_geometric_lattices","225496541_Squarefree_lexsegment_ideals","225229139_Cohomology_of_local_systems_on_the_complement_of_hyperplanes","223933017_Alexander_Duality_for_Stanley-Reisner_Rings_and_Squarefree_Nn-Graded_Modules","222650518_Local_Cohomology_at_Monomial_Ideals","222441057_Resolutions_of_Stanley-Reisner_rings_and_Alexander_duality","200621929_Modern_Graph_Theory","38352172_Generalized_Alexander_duality_and_applications","38341615_On_a_conjecture_of_K_Murasugi","2345949_Cohomology_of_the_Brieskorn-Orlik-Solomon_algebras","2139478_Extremal_Betti_Numbers_and_Applications_to_Monomial_Ideals","2075183_Local_systems_over_complements_of_hyperplanes_and_the_Kac-Kazhdan_conditions_for_singular_vectors"]}
