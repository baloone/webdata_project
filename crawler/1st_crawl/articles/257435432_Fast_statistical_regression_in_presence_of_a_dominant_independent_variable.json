{"id":"257435432_Fast_statistical_regression_in_presence_of_a_dominant_independent_variable","abstract":"Bivariate statistical regression is a statistical tool that allows performing regression on a multivariate data set under the hypothesis that one of the independent variables is dominant. Statistical regression is profitable when the amount of available data is enough to explain the relevant statistical features of the phenomenon underlying the data. The present paper suggests a fast statistical regression method based on a neural system that is able to match its inputâ€“output statistic to the marginal statistic of the available data sets. A key point of the implementation proposed in the present paper is that it is based on purely numerical-algebraic operations, which guarantee a computationally advantageous way of implementing neural systems. A number of numerical experiments, performed on real-world data sets, provide some insights into the behavior of the devised neural-system-based statistical regression method and its limitations.","authors":["Simone Fiori"],"meta":["June 2012Neural Computing and Applications 22(7-8)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-012-0958-6"],"references":["249797800_Missing_Data_in_Educational_Research_A_Review_of_Reporting_Practices_and_Suggestions_for_Improvement","246098648_Estimation_of_Diffusion_Processes_From_Incomplete_Data_A_Simulation_Study","222447231_Modeling_of_Strength_of_High-Performance_Concrete_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_Cement_and_Concrete_research_2812_1797-1808","7567721_Nonlinear_Statistical_Modelling_and_Model_Discovery_for_Cardiorespiratory_Data","2608203_Analysis_of_Incomplete_Climate_Data_Estimation_of_Mean_Values_and_Covariance_Matrices_and_Imputation_of_Missing_Values","314755797_Statistical_Analysis_with_Missing_Data","288929031_Exercise_nutrition_and_weight_control","265620140_Statistical_Analysis_With_Missing_Data","260868167_Stochastic_Modeling_in_Economics_and_Finance","240615110_Mechanical_Properties_of_Polypropylene_Matrix_Composites_Reinforced_with_Natural_Fibers_A_Statistical_Approach","239970999_EOF_Calculations_and_Data_Filling_from_Incomplete_Oceanographic_Datasets","235726150_Missing_Data_Our_View_of_the_State_of_the_Art","229531350_Coupled_Oscillators_Approach_in_Analysis_of_Bivariate_Data","228577159_Statistical_characterization_of_some_electrical_and_mechanical_phenomena_by_a_neural_probability_density_function_estimation_technique","227617974_Regression_in_a_copula_model_for_bivariate_count_data","227389206_Applied_Non-Parametric_Regression","222388972_Earthquake_hazard_assessment_based_on_bivariate_exponential_distributions","221140008_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220577844_Neural_Systems_with_Numerically-Matched_Input-Output_Statistic_Variate_Generation","200033852_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository_Irvine","200033837_Statistical_Analysis_With_Missing_Data","49695488_Meta-analysis_of_diagnostic_test_data_A_bivariate_Bayesian_modeling_approach","11286010_Missing_Data_Our_View_of_the_State_of_the_Art","7044976_A_Primer_on_the_Use_of_Modern_Missing-Data_Methods_in_Psychosomatic_Medicine_Research","6736266_Imputation_strategies_for_blood_pressure_data_nonignorably_missing_due_to_medication_use","5614042_Nonsymmetric_PDF_estimation_by_artificial_neurons_Application_to_statistical_characterization_of_reinforced_composites"]}
