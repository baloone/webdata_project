{"id":"329105022_Cross-Subject_Emotion_Recognition_Using_Flexible_Analytic_Wavelet_Transform_From_EEG_Signals","abstract":"Human emotion is a physical or psychological process which is triggered either consciously or unconsciously due to\nperception of any object or situation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to record ongoing neuronal activities\nin the brain to get the information about the human emotional state. These complicated neuronal activities in the brain causes\nnon-stationary behavior of the EEG signals. Thus, emotion recognition using EEG signals is a challenging study and it\nrequires advanced signal processing techniques to extract the\nhidden information of emotions from EEG signals. Due to poor\ngeneralizability of features from EEG signals across subject,\nrecognizing cross-subject emotion has been difficult. Thus, our\naim is to comprehensively investigate the channel specific nature\nof EEG signals and to provide an effective method based on\nflexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) for recognition of\nemotion. FAWT decomposes the EEG signal into different sub-\nband signals. Further, we applied information potential (IP) to\nextract the features from the decomposed sub-band signals of\nEEG signal. The extracted feature values were smoothed and\nfed to the random forest and support vector machine (SVM)\nclassifiers that classified the emotions. The proposed method is\napplied to two different publicly available databases which are\nSJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and database for emotion\nanalysis using physiological signal (DEAP). The proposed method\nprovided better classification performance as compared to the\nexisting method. Moreover, it yields channel specific subject\nclassification of emotion EEG signals when exposed to same\nstimuli.","authors":["Vipin Gupta","Mayur Dahyabhai Chopda","Ram Bilas Pachori"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Sensors Journal","DOI:10.1109/JSEN.2018.2883497"],"references":["325179023_Application_of_TQWT_based_filter-bank_for_sleep_apnea_screening_using_ECG_signals","323854117_Exploring_EEG_Features_in_Cross-Subject_Emotion_Recognition","319543505_Automated_Diagnosis_of_Myocardial_Infarction_ECG_Signals_Using_Sample_Entropy_in_Flexible_Analytic_Wavelet_Transform_Framework","315582822_A_new_approach_to_characterize_epileptic_seizures_using_analytic_time-frequency_flexible_wavelet_transform_and_fractal_dimension","315383408_Automated_detection_of_focal_EEG_signals_using_features_extracted_from_flexible_analytic_wavelet_transform","313675236_Automatic_sleep_stages_classification_based_on_iterative_filtering_of_electroencephalogram_signals","312043417_A_Multivariate_Approach_for_Patient-Specific_EEG_Seizure_Detection_Using_Empirical_Wavelet_Transform","310953380_A_Multimodal_Approach_to_Estimating_Vigilance_Using_EEG_and_Forehead_EOG","276443876_Investigating_Critical_Frequency_Bands_and_Channels_for_EEG-Based_Emotion_Recognition_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","262566867_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","261239872_Differential_entropy_feature_for_EEG-based_emotion_classification","256491418_Real-Time_EEG-Based_Happiness_Detection_System","251999015_Physiological_signals_based_human_emotion_Recognition_a_review","237086708_EEG-Based_Classification_of_Music_Appraisal_Responses_Using_Time-Frequency_Analysis_and_Familiarity_Ratings","234816969_EEG_feature_extraction_for_classifying_emotions_using_FCM_and_FKM","232651717_DEAP_A_Database_for_Emotion_Analysis_Using_Physiological_Signals","224088122_Affective_brain-computer_interfaces_Psychophysiological_markers_of_emotion_in_healthy_persons_and_in_persons_with_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","215990408_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","200028533_Intelligent_Pervasive_Healthcare_Systems","51174251_A_Novel_Emotion_Elicitation_Index_Using_Frontal_Brain_Asymmetry_for_Enhanced_EEG-Based_Emotion_Recognition","47642294_Gender_Differences_in_Implicit_and_Explicit_Processing_of_Emotional_Facial_Expressions_as_Revealed_by_Event-Related_Theta_Synchronization","47500416_Emotion_processing_and_the_amygdala_From_a_'low_road'_to_'many_roads'_of_evaluating_biological_significance","5652295_Wavelet-Based_Feature_Extraction_for_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Screening_Balance_Impairments_in_the_Elderly","324683960_Automated_diagnosis_of_atrial_fibrillation_ECG_signals_using_entropy_features_extracted_from_flexible_analytic_wavelet_transform","322998203_EmotionMeter_A_Multimodal_Framework_for_Recognizing_Human_Emotions","316926791_Emotions_Recognition_Using_EEG_Signals_A_Survey","312538118_Support-vector_networks","308838499_Multimodal_emotion_recognition_in_response_to_videos_Extended_abstract","304659583_Automated_Diagnosis_of_Epilepsy_Using_Key-Point-Based_Local_Binary_Pattern_of_EEG_Signals","290263915_Identifying_Stable_Patterns_over_Time_for_Emotion_Recognition_from_EEG","276163900_Weak_fault_signature_extraction_of_rotating_machinery_using_flexible_analytic_wavelet_transform","261357611_Detection_of_Human_Emotions_Using_Features_Based_on_the_Multiwavelet_Transform_of_EEG_Signals","260356925_Human_emotion_classification_from_EEG_signals_using_multiwavelet_transform","259108634_EEG-based_emotion_estimation_using_Bayesian_weighted-log-posterior_function_and_perceptron_convergence_algorithm","258794252_An_Analytic_Wavelet_Transform_With_a_Flexible_Time-Frequency_Covering","258052006_Classification_of_ictal_and_seizure-free_EEG_signals_using_fractional_linear_prediction","257351959_EEG-based_vigilance_estimation_using_extreme_learning_machines","251176519_Renyi's_Entropy_Divergence_and_Their_Nonparametric_Estimators","229059982_Emotion_and_the_autonomic_nervous_system_A_prospectus_for_research_on_autonomic_specificity","51896644_Automated_sleep_stage_identification_system_based_on_time-frequency_analysis_of_a_single_EEG_channel_and_random_forest_classifier","23196225_Investigating_Models_of_Affect_Relationships_Among_EEG_Alpha_Asymmetry_Depression_and_Anxiety","19082294_Differential_lateralization_for_positive_and_negative_emotion_in_the_human_brain_EEG_spectral_analysis","11665854_Do_existing_measures_of_Poincar_plot_geometry_reflect_nonlinear_features_of_heart_rate_variability","6462562_Music_and_emotion_Electrophysiological_correlates_of_the_processing_of_pleasant_and_unpleasant_music"]}
