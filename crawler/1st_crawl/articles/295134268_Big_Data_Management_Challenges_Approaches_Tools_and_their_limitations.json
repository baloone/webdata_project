{"id":"295134268_Big_Data_Management_Challenges_Approaches_Tools_and_their_limitations","abstract":"Big Data is the buzzword everyone talks about. Independently of the application domain, today there is a consensus about the V's characterizing Big Data: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. By focusing on Data Management issues and past experiences in the area of databases systems, this chapter examines the main challenges involved in the three V's of Big Data. Then it reviews the main characteristics of existing solutions for addressing each of the V's (e.g., NoSQL, parallel RDBMS, stream data management systems and complex event processing systems). Finally, it provides a classification of different functions offered by NewSQL systems and discusses their benefits and limitations for processing Big Data.","authors":["Michel Adiba","Juan-Carlos Castrejon-Castillo","Javier A.
