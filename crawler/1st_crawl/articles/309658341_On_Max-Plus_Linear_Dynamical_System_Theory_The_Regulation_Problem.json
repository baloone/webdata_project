{"id":"309658341_On_Max-Plus_Linear_Dynamical_System_Theory_The_Regulation_Problem","abstract":"A class of timed discrete event systems can be modeled by using Timed-Event Graphs, a class of timed Petri nets that can have its firing dynamic described by using an algebra called “Max-plus algebra”. For this kind of systems it may be desirable to enforce some timing constraints in steady state. In this paper, this problem is called a “max-plus regulation problem”. In this context we show a necessary condition for solving these regulation problems and in addition that this condition is sufficient for a large class of problems. The obtained controller is a simple linear static state feedback and can be computed using efficient pseudo-polynomial algorithms. Simulation results will illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.","authors":["Vinicius Mariano Gonçalves","Carlos Andrey Maia","Laurent Hardouin"],"meta":["January 2017Automatica 75(1):202-209","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2016.09.019","Project: Control of Max-Plus Dynamical System"],"references":["307379257_Output_Feedback_Control_of_Discrete_Processes_under_Time_Constraint_Application_to_Cluster_Tools","283193780_On_the_Steady-State_Control_of_Timed_Event_Graphs_With_Firing_Date_Constraints","265442378_Linear_Multivariable_Controll_A_Geometric_Approach","258842634_Observer_Design_for_maxplus_Linear_System","228603542_Reachability_and_observability_of_linear_systems_over_max-plus","224627986_Control_of_Linear_Min-plus_Systems_under_Temporal_Constraints","224208148_Control_of_Time-Constrained_Dual-Armed_Cluster_Tools_Using_max_Algebra","220994959_The_Tropical_Double_Description_Method","220258730_Duality_Between_Invariant_Spaces_for_Max-Plus_Linear_Discrete_Event_Systems","45926557_The_level_set_method_for_the_two-sided_eigenproblem","45889793_Tropical_polyhedra_are_equivalent_to_mean_payoff_games","29610700_Sizing_Cycle_Time_and_Plant_Control_Using_Dioid_Algebra","3032649_Max-Plus_AB-Invariant_Spaces_and_Control_of_Timed_Discrete-Event_Systems","3024820_Observers_for_multivariable_Systems","307551210_Observer-Based_Controllers_for_Max-Plus_Linear_Systems","306229979_On_the_Steady-State_Control_of_Timed_Event_Graphs_with_Firing_Date_Constraints","289237279_Observer_design_and_feedback_controller_synthesis_with_observer_in_idempotent_semiring","286178513_A_max-plus_algebra_predictive_approach_to_a_battery_assembly_system_control","283930441_Modeling_and_Control_of_Complex_Systems_in_a_Dioid_Framework","276404600_Feedback_Control_of_Cluster_Tools_for_Regulating_Wafer_Delays","269699274_An_Observer_for_Tropical_Linear_Event-Invariant_Dynamical_Systems","269266603_Control_of_cyclically_operated_high-throughput_screening_systems","262823159_Modeling_and_Control_of_high-Throughput_Screening_Systems","257144589_The_equation_AxBy_over_max","222276370_Cramer_and_Cayley-Hamilton_in_the_Max-algebra","220769694_How_to_solve_large_scale_deterministic_games_with_mean_payoff_by_policy_iteration","220387256_Max-Plus_Control_Design_for_Temporal_Constraints_Meeting_in_Timed_Event_Graphs","220384908_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_with_Respect_to_Strict_Duration_Supervision_of_an_Industrial_Manufacturing_Plant","220156777_On_the_control_of_max-plus_linear_system_subject_to_state_restriction","3660585_Max-plus_algebra_for_discrete_event_systems-some_links_to_structural_controllability_and_structural_observability","2257909_A_Method_to_Find_All_Solutions_of_a_System_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Equalities_and_Inequalities_in_the_Max_Algebra"]}
