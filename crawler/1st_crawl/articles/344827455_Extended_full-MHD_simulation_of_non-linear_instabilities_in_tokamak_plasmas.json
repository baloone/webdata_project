{"id":"344827455_Extended_full-MHD_simulation_of_non-linear_instabilities_in_tokamak_plasmas","abstract":"Non-linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations play an essential role in active research and understanding of tokamak plasmas for the realization of a fusion power plant. The development of MHD codes such as JOREK is a key aspect of this research effort. In this paper, we present an operational version of the full-MHD model implemented in JOREK, a significant advancement from the reduced-MHD model used for previous studies, where assumptions were made on the perpendicular dynamics and the toroidal magnetic field. The final model is presented in detail, and benchmarks are performed using both linear and non-linear simulations, including comparisons between the new full-MHD model of JOREK and the previously extensively studied reduced-MHD model, as well as results from the linear full-MHD code CASTOR3D. For the cases presented, this new JOREK full-MHD model is numerically and physically reliable, even without the use of numerical stabilization methods. Non-linear modeling results of typical tokamak instabilities are presented, including disruption and edge-localized-mode physics, most relevant to current open issues concerning future tokamaks such as ITER and DEMO.","authors":["S.
