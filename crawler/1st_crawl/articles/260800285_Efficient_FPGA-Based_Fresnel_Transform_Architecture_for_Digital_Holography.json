{"id":"260800285_Efficient_FPGA-Based_Fresnel_Transform_Architecture_for_Digital_Holography","abstract":"This paper presents a novel FPGA-based hardware architecture for realtime diffraction computation of digital holography. The hardware circuit is based on Fresnel transform in basic form for diffraction computation. A novel pipeline is adopted in the circuit so that all the components are operated concurrently. The computation time of the circuit is comparable to a single fast Fourier transform (FFT). Experimental results reveal that the proposed architecture has the advantages of high throughput, high accuracy and low power consumption for the 3D reconstruction of holograms.","authors":["Chau-Jern Cheng","Wen-Jyi Hwang","Chien-Ting Chen","Xin Ji Lai"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of Display Technology 10(4):272-281","DOI:10.1109/JDT.2013.2295807"],"references":["258798888_Phase_measurement_accuracy_in_digital_holographic_microscopy_using_a_wavelength-stabilized_laser_diode","251900307_Fast_numerical_reconstruction_of_digital_holography_based_on_graphic_processing_unit","229002135_Speed_up_of_Fresnel_transforms_for_digital_holography_using_pre-computed_chirp_and_GPU_processing","228610968_Power_and_Performance_Characterization_of_Computational_Kernels_on_the_GPU","228342045_Interference_techniques_in_digital_holography","41939574_Digital_Holography_Microscopy_DHM_Fast_and_robust_systems_for_industrial_inspection_with_interferometer_resolution","26273293_Special_purpose_computer_for_digital_holographic_particle_tracking_velocimetry","5310762_Special_purpose_computer_system_for_flow_visualization_using_holography_technology","3321724_Streamlining_Digital_Signal_Processing_A_Tricks_of_the_Trade_Guidebook_Second_Edition","297386499_Reconfigurable_Computing","261172509_Reconfigurable_Computing_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_FPGA-Based_Computation","256450250_Real-time_auto-focusing_digital_holographic_microscope_using_graphics_processors","253137871_Digital_holographic_recording_and_reconstruction_of_large_scale_objects_for_metrology_and_display","249337831_Fast_calculation_of_Fresnel_diffraction_calculation_using_AMD_GPU_and_OpenCL","224720744_Reconfigurable_Hardware_Applied_to_Holographic_Reconstruction","224672752_FFT_Implementation_for_Electronic_Holograms_using_Field_Programmable_Gate_Array","224395247_Using_Commodity_Graphics_Hardware_for_Real-Time_Digital_Hologram_View-Reconstruction","221725023_Two-Dimensional_Phase_Unwrapping_Theory_Algorithms_and_Software","221279386_Efficient_Approximations_for_the_Four-Quadrant_Arctangent_Function","220258281_Special_purpose_computer_system_with_highly_parallel_pipelines_for_flow_visualization_using_holography_technology","23148538_Real-time_digital_holographic_microscopy_using_the_graphic_processing_unit","5611642_Digital_holographic_microscopy_for_live_cell_applications_and_technical_inspection","4289637_Digital_Holography_Methods_in_3D-TV"]}
