{"id":"260205902_Chip-integrated_ultrafast_graphene_photodetector_with_high_responsivity","abstract":"Graphene-based photodetectors have attracted strong interest for their exceptional physical properties, which include an ultrafast response1, 2, 3 across a broad spectrum4, a strong electron–electron interaction5 and photocarrier multiplication6, 7, 8. However, the weak optical absorption of graphene2, 3 limits its photoresponsivity. To address this, graphene has been integrated into nanocavities9, microcavities10 and plasmon resonators11, 12, but these approaches restrict photodetection to narrow bands. Hybrid graphene–quantum dot architectures can greatly improve responsivity13, but at the cost of response speed. Here, we demonstrate a waveguide-integrated graphene photodetector that simultaneously exhibits high responsivity, high speed and broad spectral bandwidth. Using a metal-doped graphene junction coupled evanescently to the waveguide, the detector achieves a photoresponsivity exceeding 0.1 A W−1 together with a nearly uniform response between 1,450 and 1,590 nm. Under zero-bias operation, we demonstrate response rates exceeding 20 GHz and an instrumentation-limited 12 Gbit s−1 optical data link.","authors":["Xuetao Gan","Ren-Jye Shiue","Yuanda Gao","Inanc Meric"],"meta":["September 2013Nature Photonics 7(11):883-887","DOI:10.1038/nphoton.2013.253"],"references":["232748670_High-performance_Ge-on-Si_Photodetectors","231582274_Photo-excitation_Cascade_and_Multiple_Carrier_Generation_in_Graphene","224914566_Hybrid_graphene-quantum_dot_phototransistors_with_ultrahigh_gain","298092989_Boron_nitride_substrates_for_high-quality_graphene_electronics_Nat","263819152_A_high-speed_graphene-based_broadband_modulator","257996674_Optical_Constants_of_Noble_Metals","233788334_Improving_CMOS-compatible_Germanium_photodetectors","232805234_High-Contrast_Electro-Optic_Modulation_of_a_Photonic_Crystal_Nanocavityby_Electrical_Gating_of_Graphene","232221709_Strong_Enhancement_of_Light-Matter_Interaction_in_Graphene_Coupled_to_a_Photonic_Crystal_Nanocavity","224916261_Microcavity-Integrated_Graphene_Photodetector"]}
