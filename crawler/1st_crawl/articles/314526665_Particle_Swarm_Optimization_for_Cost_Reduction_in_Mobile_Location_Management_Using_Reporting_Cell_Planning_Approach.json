{"id":"314526665_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Cost_Reduction_in_Mobile_Location_Management_Using_Reporting_Cell_Planning_Approach","abstract":"Location management is a very critical and intricate problem in wireless mobile communication which involves tracking the movement of the mobile users in the cellular network. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed for the optimal design of the cellular network using reporting cell planning (RCP) strategy. In this state-of-the-art approach, the proposed algorithm reduces the involved total cost such as location update and paging cost for the location management issue. The same technique is proved to be a competitive approach to different existing test network problems showing the efficacy of the proposed method through simulation results. The result obtained is also validated for real network data obtained from BSNL, Odisha. Particle Swarm Optimization is used to find the optimal set of reporting cells in a given cellular network by minimizing the location management cost. This RCP technique applied to this cost minimization problem has given improved result as compared to the results obtained in the previous literature.","authors":["Smita Parija","Sudhansu Sekhar Singh","Swati Swayamsiddha"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-2322-2.ch008","In book: Recent Developments in Intelligent Nature-Inspired Computing"],"references":["220866905_New_Research_in_Nature_Inspired_Algorithms_for_Mobility_Management_in_GSM_Networks","3300722_Zomaya_AY_A_comparison_of_three_artificial_life_techniques_for_Reporting_Cell_planning_in_mobile_computing_IEEE_Trans_Parallel_Distrib_Syst_142_142-153","288287431_Cost_Reduction_in_Reporting_Cell_Planning_Configuration_Using_Soft_Computing_Algorithm","282256569_Particle_swarm_optimization_for_location_mobility_management","272912662_A_Dynamic_Location_Management_Scheme_for_Wirless_Networks_Using_Cascaded_Correlation_Neural_Network","261280153_Solving_the_Location_Areas_problem_with_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm","232651819_Intelligent_Location_Management_Using_Soft_Computing_Technique","224333505_Applying_Differential_Evolution_to_a_Realistic_Location_Area_Problem_Using_SUMATRA","221231254_Solving_a_Realistic_Location_Area_Problem_Using_SUMATRA_Networks_with_the_Scatter_Search_Algorithm","220199897_Differential_evolution_for_solving_the_mobile_location_management","220172910_Mobility_management_for_IP-based_next_generation_mobile_networks_Review_challenge_and_perspective","220098585_A_modified_hopfield_network_for_mobility_management","3631151_Genetic_Algorithms_and_the_Location_Area_Partitioning_Problem"]}
