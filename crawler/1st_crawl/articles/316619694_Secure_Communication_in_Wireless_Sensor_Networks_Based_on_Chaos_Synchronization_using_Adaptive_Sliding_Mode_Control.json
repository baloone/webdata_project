This paper considers the secure communication in wireless sensor networks based on new robust adaptive finite time chaos synchronization approach in the presence of noise and uncertainty. For this purpose, the modified Chua oscillators are added to the base station and sensor nodes to generate the chaotic signals. Chaotic signals are impregnated with the noise and uncertainty. At first, we apply the modified independent component analysis to separate the noise from the chaotic signals. Then, using the adaptive finite-time sliding mode controller, a control law and an adaptive parameter-tuning method is proposed to achieve the finite-time chaos synchronization under the noisy conditions and parametric uncertainties. Synchronization between the base station and each of the sensor nodes is realized by multiplying a selection matrix by the specified chaotic signal which is broadcasted by the base station to the sensor nodes. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique.","authors":["Saleh Mobayen","Behrouz Vaseghi","MohammadAli Pourmina"],"meta":["August 2017Nonlinear Dynamics 89(9)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-017-3543-9","Project: Secure Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on â€ŽChaos Synchronization"],"references":["313798196_A_novel_robust_adaptive_second-order_sliding_mode_tracking_control_technique_for_uncertain_dynamical_systems_with_matched_and_unmatched_disturbances","313798188_Design_of_an_adaptive_tracker_for_n-link_rigid_robotic_manipulators_based_on_super-twisting_global_nonlinear_sliding_mode_control","311846622_Data_Security_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network_using_Chaotic_Map","309448556_Composite_nonlinear_feedback_control_technique_for_masterslave_synchronization_of_nonlinear_systems","303955564_Adaptive_finite_time_tracking_control_of_uncertain_nonlinear_n-order_systems_with_unmatched_uncertainties","313860168_Synchronization_of_A_Class_of_Uncertain_Chaotic_Systems_with_Lipschitz_Nonlinearities_Using_State-Feedback_Control_Design_A_Matrix_Inequality_Approach","308321255_On_the_cryptanalysis_of_Fridrich's_chaotic_image_encryption_scheme","307530331_Design_and_Smartphone-Based_Implementation_of_a_Chaotic_Video_Communication_Scheme_via_WAN_Remote_Transmission","306522409_Multi-switching_combination_synchronization_of_three_different_chaotic_systems_via_nonlinear_control","306301481_Combination_of_ObserverKalman_Filter_Identification_and_Digital_Redesign_of_Observer-Based_Tracker_for_Stochastic_Chaotic_Systems","303846923_Frequency-Translated_Differential_Chaos_Shift_Keying_for_Chaos-Based_Communications","301916328_An_LMI_approach_to_adaptive_robust_tracker_design_for_uncertain_nonlinear_systems_with_time-delays_and_input_nonlinearities","301733569_Design_of_an_intelligent_prediction-based_neural_network_controller_for_multi-scroll_chaotic_systems","301719961_Design_of_an_adaptive_chattering_avoidance_global_sliding_mode_tracker_for_uncertain_non-linear_time-varying_systems","297743859_Novel_adaptive_feedback_synchronization_scheme_for_a_class_of_chaotic_systems_with_and_without_parametric_uncertainty"]}
