{"id":"351008055_3-WAY_GATED_RECURRENT_UNIT_NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE_FOR_STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION","abstract":"Stock price prediction has been the aim of stock investors since the beginning, which is important for the investors to make rational decisions about buying and selling stocks. Nowadays deep learning techniques and technical indicators are popular tools among researchers for predicting stock prices. Mainly researchers from the field of computer science, Statistics, and finance are actively involving in this research field. This research paper proposed a 3-way gated recurrent unit (3-GRU) architecture to forecast the next day’s close price. The model is a combination of component GRU networks, where each component GRU network predicts the next day’s close price using a different set of technical indicators. The proposed 3-GRU model was evaluated by comparing its performance with all\ncomponent GRU networks. Its performance was also compared with the GRU network that combines different sets of technical indicators into one feature vector uses it to predict the next day’s close price.\nFrom the experimental results, we observed that the 3-GRU network architecture is able to predict the next day’s close price with lower mean squared error and greater consistency than other models and\nhence concluded that it is the better approach for predicting next day’s stock price.","authors":["Arjun Saud","Subarna Shakya"],"meta":["April 2021Indian Journal of Computer Science and Engineering 12(2):421-427","DOI:10.21817/indjcse/2021/v12i2/211202011"],"references":["340705916_Analysis_of_look_back_period_for_stock_price_prediction_with_RNN_variants_A_case_study_on_banking_sector_of_NEPSE","337095012_A_Novel_Approach_to_Short-Term_Stock_Price_Movement_Prediction_using_Transfer_Learning","336429544_Deep_architectures_for_long-term_stock_price_prediction_with_a_heuristic-based_strategy_for_trading_simulations","334115043_On_the_Practical_Computational_Power_of_Finite_Precision_RNNs_for_Language_Recognition","331145867_Forecasting_stock_prices_with_a_feature_fusion_LSTM-CNN_model_using_different_representations_of_the_same_data","327484245_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Short-Term_Stock_Trends_Prediction_Based_on_Two-Stream_Gated_Recurrent_Unit_Network","317641598_Forecasting_Price_Movements_using_Technical_Indicators_Investigating_the_Impact_of_Varying_Input_Window_Length","329120510_Deep_learning-based_feature_engineering_for_stock_price_movement_prediction","327256111_Improving_Stock_Closing_Price_Prediction_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Network_and_Technical_Indicators","314157894_A_Feature_Weighted_Support_Vector_Machine_and_K-Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithm_for_Stock_Market_Indices_Prediction","301678990_A_multiple-criteria_approach_for_forecasting_stock_price_direction_Nonlinear_probability_models_with_application_in_SP_500_index","301831445_An_adaptive_stock_index_trading_decision_support_system","271630152_Modeling_fitting-function-based_fuzzy_time_series_patterns_for_evolving_stock_index_forecasting","265090298_Predicting_stock_and_stock_price_index_movement_using_Trend_Deterministic_Data_Preparation_and_machine_learning_techniques","261116902_An_SVM-based_approach_for_stock_market_trend_prediction"]}
