{"id":"331423635_Entanglement_Access_Control_for_the_Quantum_Internet","abstract":"Quantum entanglement is a crucial element of establishing the entangled network structure of the quantum Internet. Here we define a method to achieve controlled entanglement access in the quantum Internet. The proposed model defines different levels of entanglement accessibility for the users of the quantum network. The path cost is determined by an integrated criterion on the entanglement fidelities between the quantum nodes and the probabilities of entangled connections of an entangled path. We reveal the connection between the number of available entangled paths and the accessible fidelity of entanglement and reliability in the end nodes. The scheme provides an efficient model for entanglement access control in the experimental quantum Internet.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["February 2019Quantum Information Processing 18(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-019-2226-5"],"references":["330156119_Adaptive_Routing_for_Quantum_Memory_Failures_in_the_Quantum_Internet","327823506_Topology_adaption_for_the_quantum_Internet","327325042_Quantum_internet_from_communication_to_distributed_computing","327187874_Multilayer_Optimization_for_the_Quantum_Internet","326379156_Entanglement_Availability_Differentiation_Service_for_the_Quantum_Internet","330803945_A_Survey_on_quantum_computing_technology","326964138_Decentralized_base-graph_routing_for_the_quantum_internet","324744809_Quantum_Generative_Adversarial_Learning","323350911_Dynamic_topology_resilience_for_quantum_networks","323215429_The_quantum_internet_has_arrived_and_it_hasn't"]}
