{"id":"322873815_Model-based_adaptive_user_interface_based_on_context_and_user_experience_evaluation","abstract":"Personalized services have greater impact on user experience to effect the level of user satisfaction. Many approaches provide personalized services in the form of an adaptive user interface. The focus of these approaches is limited to specific domains rather than a generalized approach applicable to every domain. In this paper, we proposed a domain and device-independent model-based adaptive user interfacing methodology. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed methodology is dependent on the evaluation of user context and user experience (UX). The proposed methodology is implemented as an adaptive UI/UX authoring (A-UI/UX-A) tool; a system capable of adapting user interface based on the utilization of contextual factors, such as user disabilities, environmental factors (e.g. light level, noise level, and location) and device use, at runtime using the adaptation rules devised for rendering the adapted interface. To validate effectiveness of the proposed A-UI/UX-A tool and methodology, user-centric and statistical evaluation methods are used. The results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the existing approaches in adapting user interfaces by utilizing the users context and experience.","authors":["Jamil Hussain","Anees Ul Hassan","Hafiz Syed Muhammad Bilal","Rahman Ali"],"meta":["February 2018Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces 12(10)","DOI:10.1007/s12193-018-0258-2","Projects: Mining Minds Core Technology Exploiting Personal Big DataLean User Experience Platform"],"references":["319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","316570711_Personalization_of_Context-Dependent_Applications_Through_Trigger-Action_Rules","306034718_Human_Behavior_Analysis_by_Means_of_Multimodal_Context_Mining","305370348_The_Mining_Minds_Digital_Health_and_Wellness_Framework","304492755_On_Curating_Multimodal_Sensory_Data_for_Health_and_Wellness_Platforms","301278927_Engineering_Adaptive_Model-Driven_User_Interfaces","300224019_High-Level_Context_Inference_for_Human_Behavior_Identification","312772239_Adaptive_User_Interface_and_User_Experience_Based_Authoring_Tool_for_Recommendation_Systems","303405024_Wellness_Concepts_Model_Use_and_Effectiveness_in_Intelligent_Knowledge_Authoring_Environment","301452768_Authoring_context-dependent_cross-device_user_interfaces_based_on_triggeraction_rules"]}
