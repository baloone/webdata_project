In this technique we used\nfollowing (20 GHz, 40GHz, 60 GHz and 80 GHz ) frequency range. In our work first we have worked\nwith SSTL12 and found that when we scaled down the frequency from 80 GHz to 20 GHz 71.55%\nreduction in total IO power. In second we have worked with SSTL15 and got 74.02% of reduction in total\nIO power when we reduced frequency from 80 GHz to 20 GHz. In last we worked with SSTL18_I and\nSSTL18_II and found 74.29% and 74.28% of reduction in total power respectively, when we scaled down\nthe frequency from 80 GHz to 20 GHz. We have designed our FIFO on 28 nm kintex-7 FPGA family","authors":["Chandrashekhar Patel"],"meta":["May 2017International Journal of Engineering and Technology Vol 9 No 2(Apr-May):2","DOI:10.21817/ijet/2017/v9i2/170902113","Project: Green computing centre"],"references":["312161778_Capacitance_Scaling_Based_Low_Power_Comparator_Design_on_28nm_FPGA","312031634_High_Performance_FIFO_Design_for_Processor_through_Voltage_Scaling_Technique","271459241_SSTL_IO_Standard_based_environment_friendly_energyl_efficient_ROM_design_on_FPGA","264803042_Simulation_of_SSTL_IO_standard_based_power_optimized_parallel_integrator_design_on_FPGA","264802663_Simulation_of_voltage_based_efficient_fire_sensor_on_FPGA_using_SSTL_IO_standards","264799662_SSTL_based_green_image_ALU_design_on_different_FPGA","261465134_Energy_efficient_design_and_implementation_of_ALU_on_40nm_FPGA","261453791_IO_Standard_Based_Green_Multiplexer_Design_and_Implementation_on_FPGA"]}
