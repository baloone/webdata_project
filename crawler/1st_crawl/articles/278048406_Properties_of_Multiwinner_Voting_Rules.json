{"id":"278048406_Properties_of_Multiwinner_Voting_Rules","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to propose and study properties of multiwinner\nvoting rules which can be consider as generalisations of single-winner scoring\nvoting rules. We consider SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, STV, and several variants of\nChamberlin--Courant's and Monroe's rules and their approximations. We identify\ntwo broad natural classes of multiwinner score-based rules, and show that many\nof the existing rules can be captured by one or both of these approaches. We\nthen formulate a number of desirable properties of multiwinner rules, and\nevaluate the rules we consider with respect to these properties.","authors":["Edith Elkind","Piotr Faliszewski","Piotr Skowron","Arkadii M.
