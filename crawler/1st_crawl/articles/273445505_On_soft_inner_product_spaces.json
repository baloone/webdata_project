{"id":"273445505_On_soft_inner_product_spaces","abstract":"In the present paper an idea of soft inner product on\nsoft linear spaces has been introduced and some of their properties are\ninvestigated. Soft Hilbert spaces, orthogonality and orthonormality in soft\nHilbert spaces are also studied.","authors":["Sujoy Das","Syamal Kumar Samanta"],"meta":["July 2013"],"references":["273442337_On_soft_metric_space","268995256_Soft_real_sets_soft_real_numbers_and_their_properties","267665285_On_soft_complex_sets_and_soft_complex_numbers","255173951_On_soft_linear_spaces_and_soft_normed_linear_spaces","320007561_Soft_bckbci-algebras","320006710_Applications_of_soft_sets_in_ideal_theory_of_BCKBCI-algebras","230886111_On_Soft_Mappings","223299778_Xiao_Z_Data_analysis_approaches_of_soft_sets_under_incomplete_information_Knowledge-Based_Syst_218_941-945","223125792_Soft_set_theory","222933862_Chen_D_The_Parameterization_Reduction_of_Soft_Sets_and_Its_Applications_Comput_Math_Appl_49_757-763","222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","222119504_Soft_semirings","222348039_The_normal_parameter_reduction_of_soft_sets_and_its_algorithm","222137105_An_application_of_soft_sets_in_a_decision_making_problem","220512180_On_soft_topological_spaces"]}
