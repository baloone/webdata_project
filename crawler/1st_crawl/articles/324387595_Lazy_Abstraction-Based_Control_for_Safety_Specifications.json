{"id":"324387595_Lazy_Abstraction-Based_Control_for_Safety_Specifications","abstract":"We present a lazy version of multi-layered abstraction-based controller synthesis (ABCS) for continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems against safety specifications. State-of-the-art multi-layered ABCS uses pre-computed finite-state abstractions of different coarseness. Our new algorithm improves this technique by computing transitions on-the-fly, and only when a particular region of the state space needs to be explored by the controller synthesis algorithm for a specific coarseness. Additionally, our algorithm improves upon existing techniques by using coarser cells on a larger subset of the state space, which leads to significant computational savings.","authors":["Kyle Hsu","Rupak Majumdar","Kaushik Mallik","Anne-Kathrin Schmuck"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["273447079_Feedback_Refinement_Relations_for_the_Synthesis_of_Symbolic_Controllers","254054660_Safety_Controller_Synthesis_for_Switched_Systems_Using_Multi-Scale_Symbolic_Models","224085255_Approximately_Bisimilar_Symbolic_Models_for_Incrementally_Stable_Switched_Systems","221422256_Synthesis_of_switching_controllers_using_approximately_bisimilar_multiscale_abstractions","324178376_Multi-Layered_Abstraction-Based_Controller_Synthesis_for_Continuous-Time_Systems","301282045_SCOTS_A_Tool_for_the_Synthesis_of_Symbolic_Controllers","295932057_Safety_Controller_Synthesis_for_Incrementally_Stable_Switched_Systems_Using_Multiscale_Symbolic_Models","262402242_CoSyMA_A_Tool_for_Controller_Synthesis_Using_Multi-scale_Abstractions","226847522_Solving_Games_Via_Three-Valued_Abstraction_Refinement","3032502_Towards_a_Multiresolution_Approach_to_Linear_Control"]}
