{"id":"311953292_RECENT_NONTRADITIONAL_OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES_FOR_ASSEMBLY_SEQUENCE_PLANNING","abstract":"Generating Assembly Sequence Planning describing the sequence of parts during assembly is described to upgrading/downgrading of the product during its use by the customers. Performing assembly in an optimized way is properties of the product and the limitations set by the assembly system. In this paper optimal assembly sequence can be attained by means of implying Genetic Algorithm. A genetic algorithm that generates and evaluates assembly. plans is proposed. This paper details the genetic algorithm application for generating optimal assembly plans of a fixture assembly.","authors":["Dr Raj Kumar E"],"meta":["March 2015International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 101(5):708-716"],"references":[]}
