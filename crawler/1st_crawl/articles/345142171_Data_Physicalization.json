{"id":"345142171_Data_Physicalization","abstract":"The articles in this special section focus on data physicalization. The practice of representing data in physical form has existed for thousands of years, yet it has only become an area of investigation and exploration for scientists, designers, and artists much more recently.3 Advances in areas such as digital fabrication, actuated tangible interfaces, and shape-changing displays have spurred an emerging area of research now called Data Physicalization.1 This Special Issue of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications presents four articles spanning a wide breadth of current data physicalization research, from theory to practice.","authors":["Trevor Hogan","Uta Hinrichs","Samuel Huron","Jason Alexander"],"meta":["November 2020IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine: the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society 40(6)","DOI:10.1109/MCG.2020.3027223"],"references":["344148229_Cartographic_Design_as_Visual_Storytelling_Synthesis_and_Review_of_Map-Based_Narratives_Genres_and_Tropes","341747439_Human_Factors_in_Model_Interpretability_Industry_Practices_Challenges_and_Needs","339697298_Beyond_Accuracy_The_Role_of_Mental_Models_in_Human-AI_Team_Performance","353229162_A_Survey_on_Bias_and_Fairness_in_Machine_Learning","349604958_Human_Evaluation_of_Models_Built_for_Interpretability","348257272_CommunityClick_Capturing_and_Reporting_Community_Feedback_from_Town_Halls_to_Improve_Inclusivity","345624030_Narrative_Design_Patterns_for_Data-Driven_Storytelling","345403991_Making_Things_and_Drawing_Boundaries_Experiments_in_the_Digital_Humanities","339985135_iSeqL_interactive_sequence_learning","335434788_Data_Changes_Everything_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Data_Visualization_Design_Handoff"]}
