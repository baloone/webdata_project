{"id":"317836113_Machine_learning_and_meaningful_careers_Increasing_the_number_of_women_in_stem","abstract":"Meaningful work that gives one a sense of purpose is of great importance to young people who are entering the workforce, especially women. They are even willing to earn less money, provided that they work at a meaningful job. Only 17.9% of computer science graduates are female. More women might enter this field if they are made aware of the meaningful nature of the work. Computer science is an ideal major for students who want to improve the world and make it a better place. The authors examine the literature, and demonstrate how numerous areas including health care, education, the military, environmental studies, and crime prevention are being transformed by technology, especially newer technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.","authors":["Sarah F.
