{"id":"341389947_Surface_Display_Technology_for_Biosensor_Applications_A_Review","abstract":"Surface display is a recombinant technology that expresses target proteins on cell membranes and can be applied to almost all types of biological entities from viruses to mammalian cells. This technique has been used for various biotechnical and biomedical applications such as drug screening, biocatalysts, library screening, quantitative assays, and biosensors. In this review, the use of surface display technology in biosensor applications is discussed. In detail, phage display, bacterial surface display of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and eukaryotic yeast cell surface display systems are presented. The review describes the advantages of surface display systems for biosensor applications and summarizes the applications of surface displays to biosensors.","authors":["Min Park"],"meta":["May 2020Sensors 20(10):2775","DOI:10.3390/s20102775"],"references":["338882482_Impedimetric_biosensor_fabricated_with_affinity_peptides_for_sensitive_detection_of_Escherichia_coli_O157H7","338246631_Evolving_a_Peptide_Library_Platforms_and_Diversification_Strategies","331759631_Nanomaterial-modified_Hybrid_Platforms_for_Precise_Electrochemical_Detection_of_Dopamine","329136452_A_Regenerative_Immunoaffinity_Layer_Based_on_the_Outer_Membrane_of_Z-Domains_Autodisplaying_E_coli_for_Immunoassays_and_Immunosensors","337020941_Displaying_of_acetylcholinesterase_mutants_on_surface_of_yeast_for_ultra-trace_fluorescence_detection_of_organophosphate_pesticides_with_gold_nanoclusters","334222714_Phage_Display_in_the_Quest_for_New_Selective_Recognition_Elements_for_Biosensors","333849289_Mimicking_the_Human_Physiology_with_Microphysiological_Systems_MPS","331655581_Fabrication_Strategies_of_3D_Plasmonic_Structures_for_SERS","331622016_Orientation_Control_of_the_Molecular_Recognition_Layer_for_Improved_Sensitivity_a_Review","330407524_Aptasensors_as_a_new_sensing_technology_developed_for_the_detection_of_MUC1_mucin_A_review"]}
