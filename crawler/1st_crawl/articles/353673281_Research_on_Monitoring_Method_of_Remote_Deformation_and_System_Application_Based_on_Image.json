We study a method based on image deformation analysis, which uses Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to extract image feature points after preprocessing the acquired images, applies All-Pixels Matching (APM) method to the sequence images to do further high-precision matching to achieve the accuracy of subpixels, and finally solves the deformation variables according to the relationship of the real size of the reference target and its pixel. Wavelet analysis and least squares are used to improve the image quality and matching accuracy. Based on this method, we design and develop a new remotely automated deformation monitoring system. In this paper, we introduce the algorithm principle of deformation analysis, the integration of the system, and the engineering application example of the monitoring system. The monitoring accuracy of the system satisfying 0.1 mm within 10 m and 0.8 mm within 60 m is verified in the simultaneous comparison observation according to the high-precision total station, which illustrates the effectiveness of the present deformation analysis method and monitoring system and also has the characteristics of low monitoring cost and high degree of automation.","authors":["Yu Zhang","Ruofei Zhong","Yongrong Li","Haili Sun"],"meta":["August 2021Advances in Civil Engineering 2021(2):1-14","DOI:10.1155/2021/9229311","Project: Precision Engineering Survey"],"references":["341275294_Development_and_Application_of_a_Networked_Automatic_Deformation_Monitoring_System","339291526_A_risk_evaluation_method_for_deformation_monitoring_systems","346731821_Development_of_a_Digital_Camera-Based_Method_for_Bridge_Deformation_Measurement","337357562_Image_processing-based_real-time_displacement_monitoring_methods_using_smart_devices","324638784_Structural_Displacement_Monitoring_Using_Smartphone_Camera_and_Digital_Image_Correlation","323630420_Robust_vision_sensor_for_multi-point_displacement_monitoring_of_bridges_in_the_field","318261663_All-pixels_Participated_Image_Matching_Algorithm_for_Geometric_Solution","308821310_BE-SIFT_A_More_Brief_and_Efficient_SIFT_Image_Matching_Algorithm_for_Computer_Vision","290328469_Multi-threshold_wavelet_packet_de-noising_method_and_its_application_in_deformation_analysis","289942951_2-D_displacement_measurement_system_based_on_image_processing","271385626_A_Vision-Based_System_for_the_Dynamic_Measurement_of_In-Plane_Displacements","251943963_Multi-dynamic_displacement_measurement_based_on_digital_image_processing_technology","223589472_Monitoring_dynamic_and_quasi-static_deformations_of_large_flexible_engineering_structures_with_GPS_Accuracy_limitations_and_promises","3869963_Intelligent_image_correlation_using_genetic_algorithms_for_measuring_surface_deformations_in_the_autonomous_inspection_of_structures","3816624_Object_Recognition_from_Local_Scale-Invariant_Features"]}
