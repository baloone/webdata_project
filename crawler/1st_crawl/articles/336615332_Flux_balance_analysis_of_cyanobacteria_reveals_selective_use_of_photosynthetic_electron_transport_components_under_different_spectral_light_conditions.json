Photosynthesis is driven by balancing the excitation between PSI and PSII. To predict the detailed electron transfer flux of cyanobacteria, we refined the photosynthesis-related reactions in our previously reconstructed genome-scale model. Two photosynthetic bacteria, Arthrospira and Synechocystis, were used as models. They were grown under various spectral light conditions and flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed using photon uptake fluxes into PSI and PSII, which were converted from each light spectrum by considering the photoacclimation of pigments and the distribution ratio of phycobilisome to PSI and PSII. In Arthrospira, the FBA was verified with experimental data using six types of light-emitting diodes (White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red1, and Red2). FBA predicted the cell growth of Synechocystis for the LEDs, excepting Red2. In an FBA simulation, cells used respiratory terminal oxidases and two NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-1 and NDH-2) to balance the PSI and PSII excitations depending on the light conditions. FBA simulation with our refined model functionally implicated NDH-1 and NDH-2 as a component of cyclic electron transport in the varied light environments.","authors":["Masakazu Toyoshima","Yoshihiro Toya","Hiroshi Shimizu"],"meta":["January 2020Photosynthesis Research 143(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11120-019-00678-x"],"references":["323997610_Site_trigger_quenching_mechanism_and_recovery_of_non-photochemical_quenching_in_cyanobacteria_recent_updates","322961755_Adjustments_to_Photosystem_Stoichiometry_and_Electron_Transfer_Proteins_Are_Key_to_the_Remarkably_Fast_Growth_of_the_Cyanobacterium_Synechococcus_elongatus_UTEX_2973","320344927_Creation_and_analysis_of_biochemical_constraint-based_models_the_COBRA_Toolbox_v30","317091205_Role_of_type_2_NADPH_dehydrogenase_NdbC_in_regulation_of_carbon_allocation_in_Synechocystis_6803","314221690_Metabolic_engineering_of_Synechocystis_sp_PCC_6803_for_enhanced_ethanol_production_based_on_flux_balance_analysis","329830518_Structural_adaptations_of_photosynthetic_complex_I_enable_ferredoxin-dependent_electron_transfer","317061548_Identification_of_novel_Ssl0352_protein_NdhS_essential_for_efficient_operation_of_cyclic_electron_transport_around_photosystem_I_in_NADPHplastoquinone_oxidoreductase_NDH-1_complexes_of_Synechocystis_s","315845448_Light_regulation_of_pigment_and_photosystem_biosynthesis_in_cyanobacteria","315813703_Metabolic_Flux_Analysis_of_the_Synechocystis_sp_PCC_6803_DnrtABCD_Mutant_Reveals_a_Mechanism_for_Metabolic_Adaptation_to_Nitrogen-Limited_Conditions","314128110_Algal_light_sensing_and_photoacclimation_in_aquatic_environments","311985266_Metabolic_model_of_central_carbon_and_energy_metabolisms_of_growing_Arabidopsis_thaliana_in_relation_to_sucrose_translocation","313102947_KEGG_Kyoto_encyclopedia_of_genes_and_genomes","313014836_Metabolic_flux_analysis_of_Synechocystis_sp_PCC_6803_D_nrtABCD_mutant_reveals_a_mechanism_for_metabolic_adaptation_to_nitrogen-limited_conditions","313011130_Determination_of_accurate_extinction_coefficients_and_simultaneous_equations_for_assaying_chlorophyll's_a_and_b_extracted_with_four_different_solvents_Verification_of_the_concentration_of_chlorophyll_","311849866_Flux_balance_analysis_of_photoautotrophic_metabolism_Uncovering_new_biological_details_of_subsystems_involved_in_cyanobacterial_photosynthesis"]}
