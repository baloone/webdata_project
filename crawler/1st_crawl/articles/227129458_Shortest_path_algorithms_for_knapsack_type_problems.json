{"id":"227129458_Shortest_path_algorithms_for_knapsack_type_problems","abstract":"The group knapsack and knapsack problems are generalised to shortest path problems in a class of graphs called knapsack graphs. An efficient algorithm is described for finding shortest paths provided that arc lengths are non-negative. A more efficient algorithm is described for the acyclic case which includes the knapsack problem. In this latter case the algorithm reduces to a known algorithm.","authors":["Alan Frieze"],"meta":["December 1976Mathematical Programming 11(1):150-157","DOI:10.1007/BF01580382"],"references":["242416423_Multi-Stage_Cutting_Stock_Problems_of_Two_or_More_Dimensions","239059853_The_Theory_and_Computation_of_Knapsack_Functions","7189401_On_the_Relation_Between_Integer_and_Non-Integer_Solutions_to_Linear_Programs","309629916_Multistage_cutting_stock_problems_in_two_or_more_dimensions","242931036_Group_Theoretic_Algorithms_for_the_Integer_Programming_Problem_II_Extension_to_a_General_Algorithm","242930967_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithms_for_the_Integer_Programming_Problem--I_The_Integer_Programming_Problem_Viewed_as_a_Knapsack_Type_Problem","242562037_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_with_Graphs","242408210_The_Shortest_Path_Through_a_Maze","237935257_Some_Polyhedra_Related_to_Combinatorial_Problems","225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","224773155_The_shortest_path_through_a_maze","50334866_Integer_Programming_and_Network_Flows"]}
