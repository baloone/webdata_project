{"id":"310515781_Route_Planning_in_Transportation_Networks","abstract":"We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.","authors":["Hannah Bast","Daniel Delling","Andrew Goldberg","Matthias MÃ¼ller-Hannemann"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49487-6_2","In book: Algorithm Engineering (pp.19-80)"],"references":["316516941_Parallel_shortest_path_algorithms_for_solving_large-scale_instances","302741547_Graph_partitioning_with_natural_cuts","302605017_Hardware_accelerated_shortest_path_computation","300450292_Hub_Labels_Theory_and_Practice","289878028_Finding_multi-criteria_optimal_paths_in_multi-modal_public_transportation_networks_using_the_transit_algorithm","275575144_Shortest_Path_and_Distance_Queries_on_Road_Networks_An_Experimental_Evaluation","267759611_SALT_A_Unified_Framework_for_All_Shortest-Path_Query_Variants_on_Road_Networks","267666738_Delay-Robustness_of_Transfer_Patterns_in_Public_Transportation_Route_Planning","267475738_Recoverable_Robust_Timetable_Information","325584533_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","324381073_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","318779856_Parallel_Computation_of_Best_Connections_in_Public_Transportation_Networks","316520437_Highway_hierarchies_star","316520277_Engineering_label-constrained_shortest-path_algorithms","316520162_Reach_for_A_shortest_path_algorithms_with_preprocessing","314834831_Integer_priority_queues_with_decrease_key_in_constant_time_and_the_single_source_shortest_paths_problem","313423525_Stochastic_delay_prediction_in_large_train_networks","312980063_On_a_routing_problem","311521586_Highway_Dimension_and_Provably_Efficient_Shortest_Path_Algorithms","308264305_Towards_Mobile_Time-Dependent_Route_Planning","307632051_Ultrafast_shortest-path_queries_via_transit_nodes","306123682_Reach-based_routing_A_new_approach_to_shortest_path_algorithms_optimized_for_road_networks","303788432_Customizable_contraction_hierarchies","301928765_Customizing_Driving_Directions_with_GPUs","301439727_Frequency-based_search_for_public_transit","300356033_Robust_Distance_Queries_on_Massive_Networks","299717665_Hub_Label_Compression","299716934_Faster_Customization_of_Road_Networks","294281655_Exploiting_GPS_Data_in_Public_Transport_Journey_Planners","291055804_Computing_Multimodal_Journeys_in_Practice","289046212_Transit_Nodes_-_Lower_Bounds_and_Refined_Construction","288438920_Flow-Based_Guidebook_Routing","288425370_Bidirectional_A_search_with_additive_approximation_bounds","288271491_Multi-hop_ride_sharing","287066750_Better_transit_routing_by_exploiting_vehicle_GPS_data","286955308_Connection_Scan_Accelerated","286518249_Speed-consumption_tradeoff_for_electric_vehicle_route_planning","286167649_Fast_Shortest-path_Distance_Queries_on_Road_Networks_by_Pruned_Highway_Labeling","285203978_Route_planning_for_bicycles_-_Exact_constrained_shortest_paths_made_practical_via_contraction_hierarchy","284569496_Polynomial-time_Construction_of_Contraction_Hierarchies_for_Multi-criteria_Objectives","282948617_Placement_of_Loading_Stations_for_Electric_Vehicles_No_Detours_Necessary","281925182_Enabling_E-mobility_Facility_location_for_battery_loading_stations","279904973_Faster_batched_shortest_paths_in_road_networks","278713556_Parallel_Bi-objective_Shortest_Paths_Using_Weight-Balanced_B-trees_with_Bulk_Updates","277935560_Customizable_Route_Planning_in_Road_Networks","276465055_On_k-Path_Covers_and_their_applications","275588118_Trip-Based_Public_Transit_Routing","275484623_Dijkstra's_algorithm_on-line","274738954_User-Constrained_Multi-Modal_Route_Planning","269857498_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","267039400_Engineering_Graph-Based_Models_for_Dynamic_Timetable_Information_Systems","266699904_Improved_Alternative_Route_Planning","266607389_On_the_Complexity_of_Partitioning_Graphs_for_Arc-Flags","266558618_GRASP_Extending_Graph_Separators_for_the_Single-Source_Shortest-Path_Problem","267434624_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Alternative_Routes_HiDAR"]}
