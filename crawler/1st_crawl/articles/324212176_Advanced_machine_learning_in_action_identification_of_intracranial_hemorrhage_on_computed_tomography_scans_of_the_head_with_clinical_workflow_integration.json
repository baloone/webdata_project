A team of researchers from Geisinger in Danville, Pennsylvania, USA, trained and tested a machine-learning algorithm using 46,583 computed tomography imaging studies of the head. Subsequently, they implemented the model into routine care for 3 months to help prioritize radiology worklists. Of 347 routine cases, the computer identified 94 as having an intracranial hemorrhage, two-thirds of which were confirmed by a radiologist, including five among patients who had a new diagnosis of a brain bleed. The algorithm reduced the average time in which a radiologist diagnosed these patients from around 8.5 h to just 19 min, demonstrating the positive impact of incorporating artificial intelligence into radiology workflow.","authors":["Mohammad R.
