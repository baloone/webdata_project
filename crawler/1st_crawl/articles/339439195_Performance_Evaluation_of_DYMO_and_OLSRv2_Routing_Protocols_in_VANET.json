{"id":"339439195_Performance_Evaluation_of_DYMO_and_OLSRv2_Routing_Protocols_in_VANET","abstract":"Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is one of the emerging mobile ad hoc networking paradigms (MANET), where the self-organizing and infrastructure-less nature of MANET structure. In VANETs, vehicle nodes communicate with each other using wireless links. However, the nodes are highly mobile and the topology of the network changes rapidly. Therefore, the design of routing protocols in VANETs is still a crucial issue. In this paper, we examine two of the most recent routing protocols that proposed for MANETs to select the optimal path between source-destination pairs, namely: Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) and Optimized Link State Routing version 2 (OLSRv2) routing protocols. We evaluated and compared the performance of both protocols based on different parameters under various simulation scenarios. The result has shown that the DYMO protocol has higher throughput and packet delivery ratio compare to the OLSRv2 protocol. However, the OLSRv2 protocols has better performance in the terms of average jitter and end to end delay compare to the DYMO protocol based on the paperâ€™s scenario. OLSRv2 should be selected if the system concerns about time delay and jitter, otherwise it should be selected DYMO to achieve higher throughput and high packet delivery.","authors":["Waheb A.
