{"id":"333301861_Double_isolation_Identity_expression_threat_predicts_greater_gender_disparities_in_computer_science","abstract":"Three studies examine the relationship between womenâ€™s expression of interest in computer science and identity expression threat, the concern about conveying an identity inconsistent with one's gender role. Undergraduates perceive academic majors to signal who they are to peers (Study 1). Women imagining majoring in computer science report greater identity expression threat from their peers outside computer science than from those inside the field (Study 2). Women report greater identity expression threat in computer science (but not biology or English) than do men. Identity expression threat mediates gender differences in reported likelihood of downplaying interest in computer science (Study 3). Women considering computer science perceive they will be doubly isolated, both from those within and outside the field.","authors":["Sapna Cheryan","Ella J.
