{"id":"230899492_Statistical_mechanical_evaluation_of_spread_spectrum_watermarking_model_with_image_restoration","abstract":"In cases in which an original image is blind, a decoding method where both\nthe image and the messages can be estimated simultaneously is desirable. We\npropose a spread spectrum watermarking model with image restoration based on\nBayes estimation. We therefore need to assume some prior probabilities. The\nprobability for estimating the messages is given by the uniform distribution,\nand the ones for the image are given by the infinite range model and 2D Ising\nmodel. Any attacks from unauthorized users can be represented by channel\nmodels. We can obtain the estimated messages and image by maximizing the\nposterior probability.\nWe analyzed the performance of the proposed method by the replica method in\nthe case of the infinite range model. We first calculated the theoretical\nvalues of the bit error rate from obtained saddle point equations and then\nverified them by computer simulations. For this purpose, we assumed that the\nimage is binary and is generated from a given prior probability. We also assume\nthat attacks can be represented by the Gaussian channel. The computer\nsimulation retults agreed with the theoretical values.\nIn the case of prior probability given by the 2D Ising model, we evaluated\nthe decoding performance by computer simulations since the replica theory could\nnot be applied. Results using the 2D Ising model showed that the proposed\nmethod with image restoration is as effective as the infinite range model for\ndecoding messages.\nWe compared the performances in a case in which the image was blind and one\nin which it was informed. The difference between these cases was small as long\nas the embedding and attack rates were small. This demonstrates that the\nproposed method with simultaneous estimation is effective as a watermarking\ndecoder.","authors":["Masaki Kawamura","Kao Hayashi","Tatsuya Uezu","Masato Okada"],"meta":["June 2019PHYSICAL REVIEW E 99(6)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.99.062132","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266517844_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing-An_Introduction","239005318_Statistical_Mechanical_Study_of_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Multiuser_Detectors_Analysis_of_Replica_Symmetric_and_One-Step_Replica_Symmetry_Breaking_Solutions---","235410255_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing","231152856_Statistical-mechanical_approach_to_image_processing","231088544_Theory_of_Spin_Glasses","230929671_Statistical_mechanics_of_CDMA_multiuser_demodulation","220224112_Computational_Complexity_of_Optimum_Multiuser_Detection","220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","11769019_Image_restoration_using_the_Q-Ising_spin_glass","5567414_Secure_spread_spectrum_watermarking_for_multimedia"]}
