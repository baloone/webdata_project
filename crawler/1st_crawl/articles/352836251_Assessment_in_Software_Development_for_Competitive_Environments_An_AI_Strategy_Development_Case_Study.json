{"id":"352836251_Assessment_in_Software_Development_for_Competitive_Environments_An_AI_Strategy_Development_Case_Study","abstract":"Competitions are being widely used to motivate students in diverse learning processes, including those in computer programming. This paper presents a methodology for designing and assessing competitive learning scenarios that allow students to develop three different coding skills: the ability to compete against unknown competitors, the ability to compete against known competitors and the ability to compete against refined versions of known competitors. The proposal is based on peer code review, implemented as an improvement cycle after the dissemination of the code among participants. A case study evaluating the methodology was conducted with two cohorts of students in an undergraduate course. The analysis of the obtained grades suggests that while performance after our assistance was improved, students could still fail or succeed independently of the assistance. Complementary data from student questionnaires and supervisor observations are aligned with this finding. As a conclusion, the evidence supports the validity of the methodology. Additionally, several guidelines based on the experience are provided to transfer the proposal to other environments.","authors":["Manuel Palomo-Duarte","Antonio García-Domínguez","Antonio Balderas"],"meta":["June 2021Electronics 10(13):1566","DOI:10.3390/electronics10131566","Project: VISAIGLE"],"references":["333224428_Evaluation_of_Robocode_as_a_Teaching_Tool_for_Computer_Programming","328806047_The_Effect_of_Using_Educational_Games_in_Teaching_Kingdoms_of_Living_Things","309447448_Improving_programming_skills_using_computer_based_feedback_and_peer_group_competition","301601332_ClueConnect_a_word_array_game_to_promote_student_comprehension_of_key_terminology_in_an_introductory_anatomy_and_physiology_course","282956563_A_teacher's_view_about_introductory_programming_teaching_and_learning_Difficulties_strategies_and_motivations","347991037_Challenge-based_learning_in_higher_education_an_exploratory_literature_review","342459122_RoboSTEAM_Project_Systematic_Mapping_Challenge_Based_Learning_and_Robotics","339481246_The_Robosoccer_as_a_Modern_Educational_Platform_in_the_Field_of_Artificial_Intelligence","334498442_Does_Winning_or_Losing_Change_Players'_Engagement_in_Competitive_Games_Experiments_in_Virtual_Reality","318296054_Challenge-Based_Learning","272377211_Competitive_Video_Game_Play","266893604_Video_Games_Competition_and_Exercise_A_New_Opportunity_for_Sport_Psychologists","270585089_Modeling_and_Measuring_Competencies_in_Higher_Education","264387242_Motivation_and_Emotions_in_Competition_Systems_for_Education_An_Empirical_Study","264125333_Open_classroom_Enhancing_student_achievement_on_artificial_intelligence_through_an_international_online_competition"]}
