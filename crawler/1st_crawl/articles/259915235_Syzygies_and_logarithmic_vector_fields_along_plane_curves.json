{"id":"259915235_Syzygies_and_logarithmic_vector_fields_along_plane_curves","abstract":"We investigate the relations between the syzygies of the Jacobian ideal of\nthe defining equation for a plane curve $C$ and the stability of the sheaf of\nlogarithmic vector fields along $C$, the freeness of the divisor $C$ and the\nTorelli properties of $C$ (in the sense of Dolgachev-Kapranov).\nWe show in particular that curves with a small number of nodes and cusps are\nTorelli in this sense.","authors":["Alexandru Dimca","Edoardo Sernesi"],"meta":["January 2014Journal de l’École polytechnique — Mathématiques 1(2014):247-267","DOI:10.5802/jep.10","SourcearXiv","Projects: Jacobian syzygies and applicationsFree and nearly free projective hypersurfaces"],"references":["278085977_Some_remarks_on_limit_mixed_Hodge_structures_and_spectrum","265080882_Lectures_on_Equations_Defining_Space_Curves","321610578_Singularities_of_Differentiable_Maps_Volume_II_Monodromy_and_Asymptotic_Integrals","321507344_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","317836560_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","316800400_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","268618347_Deformations_of_Algebraic_Schemes","265489706_Vector_bundles_on_complex_projective_spaces_With_an_appendix_by_S_I_Gelfand_Corrected_reprint_of_the_1988_edition","265350131_Stable_rank-2_vector_bundles_on_P_2_with_c_1_odd","259625039_Free_Divisors_versus_Stability_and_Coincidence_Thresholds"]}
