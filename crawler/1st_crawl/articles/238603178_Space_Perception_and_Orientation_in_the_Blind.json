{"id":"238603178_Space_Perception_and_Orientation_in_the_Blind","abstract":"The role of visualization in the ability of the blind to perceive and manipulate spatial relations factually and to orient themselves spatially was investigated in the present series of three experiments. In the first experiment we employed the methods of reproduction, verbal report, and recognition in testing the tactual perception of simple geometric forms. The second experiment dealt with problems of imaginaly constructing a total form from the tactual perception of two parts of the form. Space orientation was studied in the third series of experiments. Two groups of 33 totally blind and 33 sighted Ss matched on the basis of sex and chronological age were used. in the investigation. It was concluded that the sighted Ss are superior to the blind in tactual form perception measured by reproduction and verbal report, in the imaginal manipulation of space relations, and in space orientation. The blind do as well as the sighted in the recognition of tactual form. Sex differences are in favor of the males, but the differences were not significant in any of the tests. The ability to translate tactile kinesthetic impressions into visual imagery gives significantly better scores in all of the tests of form perception except recognition and space orientation. In the space orientation tests, visual imagery is important in directional orientation, but the estimation of time is fundamental in distance orientation for both the blind and the sighted Ss.","authors":["Philip Worchel"],"meta":["January 1951Psychological Monographs 65(15)","DOI:10.1037/h0093640"],"references":["284869037_Tests_for_visual_and_haptical_aptitudes","232499792_The_spatial_threshold_of_touch_in_blind_and_in_seeing_children"]}
