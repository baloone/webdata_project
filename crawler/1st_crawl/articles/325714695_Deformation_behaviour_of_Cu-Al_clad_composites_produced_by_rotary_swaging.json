{"id":"325714695_Deformation_behaviour_of_Cu-Al_clad_composites_produced_by_rotary_swaging","abstract":"Al/Cu composites are an advantageous perspective material applicable in various industrial branches, from electrotechnics to transportation industry. This study focused on the investigation of Al/Cu clad composites produced by rotary swaging at two different temperatures, 20°C and 250°C. The composites were swaged from the original 30 mm down to 5 mm with the total swaging degree of 3.58, however, samples were acquired after multiple steps. The influences of the processing conditions on the structure were studied via scanning electron microscopy; the analyses mainly focused on the deformation behaviour of the component metals and the possible development of intermetallic phases on their interfaces, as well as on the grains orientation. During processing, the radial swaging forces were recorded with our own developed KOMAFU S600 system for dynamic detection of swaging forces. According to the results of the analyses, the swaging temperature influenced significantly the behaviour of the composites, as did also the total imposed strain. The composite swaged at 250°C was affected more notably, the cross-sections of the Al wires in the composite were deformed due to the influence of the radial swaging dies movement more significantly than in the composite swaged at 20°C. This effect was evident for all the investigated swaging steps and increased with increasing total imposed strain. The higher swaging temperature also decreased the plastic flow of the material; the deformation work was 730.3 kJ for 250°C composite and 650.7 kJ for the 20°C one. Tensile testing revealed similar effect; while the UTS for both the composites was slightly higher than 280 MPa, the plasticity of 250°C composite was evidently higher.","authors":["Lenka Kunčická","Radim Kocich"],"meta":["May 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 369(1):012029","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/369/1/012029"],"references":["316569628_Development_of_Ni-WC_composite_clad_using_microwave_energy","304536963_Joining_process_for_copper_and_aluminum_tubes_by_rotary_swaging_method","321075146_Maintaining_nano-lamellar_microstructure_in_friction_stir_welding_FSW_of_accumulative_roll_bonded_ARB_Cu-Nb_nano-lamellar_composites_NLC","320439371_Nd_YAG_pulsed_laser_welding_of_TC4_Ti_alloy_to_301L_stainless_steel_using_TaVFe_composite_interlayer","315436912_Improvement_of_mechanical_and_electrical_properties_of_rotary_swaged_Al-Cu_clad_composites","309015564_Cold_rotary_swaging_of_a_tungsten_heavy_alloy_Numerical_and_experimental_investigations","305845163_Sub-structure_and_mechanical_properties_of_twist_channel_angular_pressed_aluminium","283769373_Developments_in_Processing_of_Functionally_Gradient_Metals_and_Metal-Ceramic_Composites_A_Review","283558535_Deformation_behavior_of_multilayered_Al-Cu_clad_composite_during_cold-swaging","282841403_Synthesis_of_an_AlAl2O3_composite_by_severe_plastic_deformation","281413139_Enhanced_grain_refinement_of_commercial_pure_copper_using_the_ECAE_of_Al-Cu-Al_tri-layer_composite","276513829_Bond_strength_optimization_of_TiCuTi_clad_composites_produced_by_roll-bonding","281739058_Recrystallization_and_Related_Annealing_Phenomena_Second_Edition","272408257_Fabrication_and_characterization_of_cold-swaged_multilayered_Al-Cu_clad_composites","265382352_Effect_of_component_layer_thickness_on_the_bending_behaviors_of_roll-bonded_tri-layered_MgAlSTS_clad_composites"]}
