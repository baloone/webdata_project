{"id":"321662292_Ontology-Based_EducationIndustry_Collaboration_System","abstract":"As the main supplier of the workforce to the industry, higher education is increasingly criticised for not being abreast with the digital revolution and being disconnected from the industry. Competency-based education was developed to address this issue and bridge the gap between what the university is producing and the requirements of the industry. Hence, tools need to be developed that assists in the analysis process. This paper focuses on proposing a system that models the competencies required by occupations in the industry and higher education curricula and assists in matching profiles from the two domains. The different concepts in the domain are modelled as a semantic web ontology, and an inference engine performs the profile matching. In addition to the profile matching, the system calculates a score for the matching degree using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method.","authors":["Houssem Gasmi","Abdelaziz Bouras"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2778879","Project: PROSKIMA"],"references":["307862641_Evolution_of_ICT_industry_landscape_and_its_impact_on_higher_education_competencies","302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","265882207_Application_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_to_an_online_Recruitment_System","326338097_Pellet_A_Practical_OWL-DL_Reasoner","319393573_OWL_2_Web_Ontology_Language_Structural_Specification_and_Functional-Style_Syntax","318706598_PROMA_AN_ONTOLOGY_BASED_APPLICATION_FOR_EDUCATIONINDUSTRY_COLLABORATION","318494191_RESTful_Web_Services","316450647_Ontology_Based_System_to_Guide_Internship_Assignment_Process","280681098_Cooperative_Education_Development_Towards_ICT_Reference_Models","272829948_A_Practical_Guide_To_Building_OWL_Ontologies_Using_Protege_4_and_CO-ODE_Tools_Edition_13"]}
