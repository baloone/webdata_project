{"id":"228674060_A_Comparison_of_Upper_Ontologies_Technical_Report_DISI-TR-06-21","abstract":"Upper Ontologies are quickly becoming a key technology for inte-grating heterogeneous knowledge coming from different sources. In this techni-cal report we analyse 7 Upper Ontologies, namely BFO, Cyc, DOLCE, GFO, PROTON, Sowa's ontology, and SUMO, according to a set of standard software engineering criteria, and we synthesise our analysis in form of a comparative ta-ble. A summary of some existing comparisons drawn among subsets of the 7 Upper Ontologies that we deal with in this document, is also provided.","authors":["Viviana Mascardi","Valentina Cord√¨","Paolo Rosso"],"meta":[],"references":["265273652_Toward_the_Use_of_an_Upper_Ontology_for_US_Government_and_US_Military_Domains_An_Evaluation_September_2004","242416173_The_Comprehensive_Terrorism_Knowledge_Base_in_Cyc","228750894_On_the_effective_use_of_Cyc_in_a_question_answering_system","221606177_A_Knowledge-Based_Approach_to_Network_Security_Applying_Cyc_in_the_Domain_of_Network_Risk_Assessment","221438271_On_the_Application_of_the_Cyc_Ontology_to_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","221234996_OntoMap_portal_for_upper-level_ontologies","221234966_Towards_a_Standard_Upper_Ontology","247090293_OWL_Web_Ontology_Language_Overview_W3C_Recommendation_10_February_2004","242393169_Formal_representation_of_concepts_The_Suggested_Upper_Merged_Ontol-_ogy_and_its_use_in_linguistics","221562665_How_to_Build_a_Foundational_Ontology_The_Object-Centered_High-level_Reference_Ontology_OCHRE"]}
