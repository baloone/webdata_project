{"id":"311618483_Numerical_investigations_on_cavitation_intensity_for_3D_homogeneous_unsteady_viscous_flows","abstract":"The cavitation erosion remains an industrial issue. In this paper, we deal with the cavitation intensity which can be described as the aggressiveness - or erosive capacity - of a cavitating flow. The estimation of this intensity is a challenging problem both in terms of modelling the cavitating flow and predicting the erosion due to cavitation. For this purpose, a model was proposed to estimate cavitation intensity from 3D unsteady cavitating flow simulations. An intensity model based on pressure and void fraction derivatives was developped and applied to a NACA 65012 hydrofoil tested at LMH-EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) [1]. 2D and 3D unsteady cavitating simulations were performed using a homogeneous model with void fraction transport equation included in Code_Saturne with cavitating module [2]. The article presents a description of the numerical code and the physical approach considered. Comparisons between 2D and 3D simulations, as well as between numerical and experimental results obtained by pitting tests, are analyzed in the paper.","authors":["Christophe Leclercq","Antoine Archer","Regiane Fortes Patella"],"meta":["November 2016IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science 49(9):092007","DOI:10.1088/1755-1315/49/9/092007","Project: Numerical Prediction of Cavitation Erosion"],"references":["285629890_Numerical_Modelling_and_Prediction_of_Erosion_Induced_by_Hydrodynamic_Cavitation","281921326_A_Phenomenological_and_numerical_model_for_scaling_the_flow_agressiveness_in_cavitation_erosion","267266082_Cavitation_Erosion_Prediction_by_Numerical_Cavitation","267266046_Evaluation_of_the_Turbulence_Model_Influence_on_the_Numerical_Simulations_of_Unsteady_Cavitation","267266001_Numerical_estimation_of_cavitation_intensity","325777423_A_unified_framework_for_incompressible_and_compressible_fluid_flows","286297847_Assessment_of_Erosion_Sensitive_Areas_via_Compressible_Simulation_of_Unsteady_Cavitating_Flows","280892171_Evaluation_of_the_Turbulence_Model_Influence_on_the_Numerical_Simulations_of_Unsteady_Cavitation","271617983_Mass_loss_simulation_in_cavitation_erosion_Fatigue_criterion_approach","267496665_Numerical_Prediction_Method_of_Cavitation_Erosion"]}
