{"id":"271532495_Decomposable_Norm_Minimization_with_Proximal-Gradient_Homotopy_Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper we study the convergence rate of proximal-gradient homotopy\nalgorithm for norm-regularized linear least squares problems. Homotopy\nalgorithm reduces regularization parameter in a series of steps, and uses\nproximal-gradient algorithm to solve the problem at each step.\nProximal-gradient algorithm has a linear rate of convergence given that the\nobjective function is strongly convex and the gradient of the smooth component\nof the objective function is Lipschitz continuous. In general, the objective\nfunction in this type of problems is not strongly convex, especially when the\nproblem is high-dimensional. We will show that if the linear sampling matrix\nand the regularizing norm satisfy certain assumptions, proximal-gradient\nhomotopy algorithm converges with a linear rate even though the objective\nfunction is not strongly convex. Our result generalizes results on the linear\nconvergence of homotopy algorithm for $l_1$-regularized least squares problems.","authors":["Reza Eghbali","Maryam Fazel"],"meta":["March 2017Computational Optimization and Applications 66(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10589-016-9871-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259432166_On_first-order_algorithms_for_l_1nuclear_norm_minimization","259191843_Iteration_Complexity_of_Randomized_Block-Coordinate_Descent_Methods_for_Minimizing_a_Composite_Function","257810185_On_the_Linear_Convergence_of_a_Proximal_Gradient_Method_for_a_Class_of_Nonsmooth_Convex_Minimization_Problems","249903370_Fixed-Point_Continuation_for_l1-Minimization_Methodology_and_Convergence","287343795_On_the_linear_convergence_of_the_proximal_gradient_method_for_trace_norm_regularization","265081388_The_Generic_Chaining","263582530_Linear_Convergence_of_Stochastic_Iterative_Greedy_Algorithms_With_Sparse_Constraints","258222850_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","246208982_Fonctions_convexes_duales_et_points_proximaux_dans_un_espace_hilbertien","243787569_Introductory_Lectures_on_Convex_Optimization_A_Basic_Course","236871657_On_the_Complexity_Analysis_of_Randomized_Block-Coordinate_Descent_Methods","236736746_An_Accelerated_Proximal_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Nuclear_Norm_Regularized_Least_Squares_Problems","236203787_A_New_Analysis_of_Compressive_Sensing_by_Stochastic_Proximal_Gradient_Descent","243092619_Monotone_Operators_and_the_Proximal_Point_Algorithm","227030158_Some_inequalities_for_Gaussian_processes_and_applications"]}
