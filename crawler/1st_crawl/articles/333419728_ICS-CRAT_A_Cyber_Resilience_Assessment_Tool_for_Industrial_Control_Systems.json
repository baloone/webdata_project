{"id":"333419728_ICS-CRAT_A_Cyber_Resilience_Assessment_Tool_for_Industrial_Control_Systems","abstract":"In this work, we use a subjective approach to compute cyber resilience metrics for industrial control systems. We utilize the extended form of the R4 resilience framework and span the metrics over physical, technical, and organizational domains of resilience. We develop a qualitative cyber resilience assessment tool using the framework and a subjective questionnaire method. We make sure the questionnaires are realistic, balanced, and pertinent to ICS by involving subject matter experts into the process and following security guidelines and standards practices. We provide detail mathematical explanation of the resilience computation procedure. We discuss several usages of the qualitative tool by generating simulation results. We provide a system architecture of the simulation engine and the validation of the tool. We think the qualitative simulation tool would give useful insights for industrial control systems' overall resilience assessment and security analysis.","authors":["Md Ariful Haque","Sachin Shetty","Bheshaj Krishnappa"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2019.00058","Conference: The 4th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data and Security (IEEE IDS 2019)At: Washington DC, USA","Project: Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery Consortium Project"],"references":["328303093_Cyber_Resilience_Framework_for_Industrial_Control_Systems_Concepts_Metrics_and_Insights","325052517_Improving_bulk_power_system_resilience_by_ranking_critical_nodes_in_the_vulnerability_graph","281251779_Resilience_Engineering_in_Practice_A_Guidebook","241144902_A_Framework_to_Quantitatively_Assess_and_Enhance_the_Seismic_Resilience_of_Communities","333419503_Analysis_of_Bulk_Power_System_Resilience_Using_Vulnerability_Graph","327935005_Measurement_and_Analysis_of_Cyber_Resilience_for_Control_Systems_An_Illustrative_Example","315942666_Improving_the_cyber_resilience_of_industrial_control_systems","280797284_Relative_measurement_and_its_generalization_in_decision_making_why_pairwise_comparisons_are_central_in_mathematics_for_the_measurement_of_intangible_factors_the_analytic_hierarchynetwork_process","272374970_Systems_engineering_framework_for_cyber_physical_security_and_resilience","259136909_A_metric_and_frameworks_for_resilience_analysis_of_engineered_and_infrastructure_systems"]}
