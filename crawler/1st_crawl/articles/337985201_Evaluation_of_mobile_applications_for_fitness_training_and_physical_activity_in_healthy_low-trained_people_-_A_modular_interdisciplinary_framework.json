{"id":"337985201_Evaluation_of_mobile_applications_for_fitness_training_and_physical_activity_in_healthy_low-trained_people_-_A_modular_interdisciplinary_framework","abstract":"Numerous mobile applications are available that aim at supporting sustainable physical activity and fitness training in sedentary or low-trained healthy people. However, the evaluation of the quality of these applications often suffers from severe shortcomings such as reduction to selective aspects, lack of theory or suboptimal methods. What is still missing, is a framework that integrates the insights of the relevant scientific disciplines.\nIn this paper, we propose an integrative framework comprising four modules: training, behavior change techniques, sensors and technology, and evaluation of effects. This framework allows to integrate insights from training science, exercise physiology, social psychology, computer science, and civil engineering as well as methodology. Furthermore, the framework can be flexibly adapted to the specific features of the mobile applications, e.g., regarding training goals and training methods or the relevant behavior change techniques as well as formative or summative evaluation.","authors":["Josef Wiemeyer"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of Computer Science in Sport 18(3):12-43","DOI:10.2478/ijcss-2019-0016"],"references":["336209946_Cochrane_Handbook_for_Systematic_Reviews_of_Interventions","331101002_The_App_Behavior_Change_Scale_Creation_of_a_Scale_to_Assess_the_Potential_of_Apps_to_Promote_Behavior_Change","330307574_Can_Digital_Coaching_Boost_Your_Performance_-_A_Qualitative_Study_among_Physically_Active_People","328606071_App_Behaviour_Change_Scale_Creation_of_a_scale_to_assess_the_potential_for_apps_to_lead_to_behaviour_change_Preprint","328370177_Stimuli_and_sensors_that_initiate_skeletal_muscle_hypertrophy_following_resistance_exercise","326627144_How_to_Construct_Conduct_and_Analyze_an_Exercise_Training_Study","326338353_When_Adults_Don't_Exercise_Behavioral_Strategies_to_Increase_Physical_Activity_in_Sedentary_Middle-Aged_and_Older_Adults","326039675_A_Critical_Review_of_Consumer_Wearables_Mobile_Applications_and_Equipment_for_Providing_Biofeedback_Monitoring_Stress_and_Sleep_in_Physically_Active_Populations","325967757_Measurement_Prediction_and_Control_of_Individual_Heart_Rate_Responses_to_Exercise_-_Basics_and_Options_for_Wearable_Devices","329618390_Can_Smartphone_Apps_Increase_Physical_Activity_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis"]}
