{"id":"220579558_PDE4Java_Plagiarism_Detection_Engine_for_Java_source_code_a_clustering_approach","abstract":"The educational community across the world is facing the increasing problem of plagiarism. The proposed Plagiarism Detection Engine for Java (PDE4Java) detects code-plagiarism by applying data mining techniques. The engine consists of three main phases; Java tokenisation, similarity measurement and clustering. It has an optional default tokeniser that makes it flexible to be used with almost any programming language. The system provides a visualising representation for each cluster besides the textual representation. The simulation results of PDE4Java showed a comparable performance to that of JPlag and it outperformed the expectations when compared to the domain experts' findings.","authors":["Ameera Jadalla","Ashraf M Elnagar"],"meta":["January 2008International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining 3(2):121-135","DOI:10.1504/IJBIDM.2008.020514","SourceDBLP"],"references":["315784887_Plagiarism_Deterrence_Detection_and_Prevention","262763983_String_Similarity_via_Greedy_String_Tiling_and_Running_Karp-Rabin_Matching","234788509_A_plagiarism_detection_system","234127095_Does_automated_anti-plagiarism_have_to_be_complex_Evaluating_more_appropriate_software_metrics_for_finding_collusion","230897316_Efficient_and_Effective_Plagiarism_Detection_for_Large_Code_Repositories","228771531_Plagiarism_and_poor_academic_practice_-_A_threat_to_the_extension_of_e-learning_in_higher_education","244438006_Plagiarism_in_natural_and_programming_languages_An_overview_of_current_tools_and_technologies","234778734_Metrics_based_plagarism_monitoring","234127028_Source_Code_Plagiarism_in_UK_HE_Computing_Schools_Issues_Attitudes_and_Tools","229477827_Preserving_academic_integrity_-_Fighting_against_nonoriginality_agencies"]}
