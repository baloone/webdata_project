{"id":"346002597_Orientation-Aware_Vehicle_Re-Identification_with_Semantics-Guided_Part_Attention_Network","abstract":"Vehicle re-identification (re-ID) focuses on matching images of the same vehicle across different cameras. It is fundamentally challenging because differences between vehicles are sometimes subtle. While several studies incorporate spatial-attention mechanisms to help vehicle re-ID, they often require expensive keypoint labels or suffer from noisy attention mask if not trained with expensive labels. In this work, we propose a dedicated Semantics-guided Part Attention Network (SPAN) to robustly predict part attention masks for different views of vehicles given only image-level semantic labels during training. With the help of part attention masks, we can extract discriminative features in each part separately. Then we introduce Co-occurrence Part-attentive Distance Metric (CPDM) which places greater emphasis on co-occurrence vehicle parts when evaluating the feature distance of two images. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","authors":["Tsai-Shien Chen","Chih-Ting Liu","Chih-Wei Wu","Shao-Yi Chien"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-58536-5_20","In book: Computer Vision – ECCV 2020, 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part II (pp.330-346)"],"references":["338511791_Part-Regularized_Near-Duplicate_Vehicle_Re-Identification","332815199_Divide_and_Fuse_A_Re-ranking_Approach_for_Person_Re-identification","324104841_Features_for_Multi-Target_Multi-Camera_Tracking_and_Re-Identification","319121795_Divide_and_Fuse_A_Re-ranking_Approach_for_Person_Re-identification","316034140_Learning_Deep_Context-Aware_Features_over_Body_and_Latent_Parts_for_Person_Re-identification","315807887_Beyond_Triplet_Loss_A_Deep_Quadruplet_Network_for_Person_Re-identification","315806890_Beyond_triplet_loss_a_deep_quadruplet_network_for_person_re-identification","310462231_A_Discriminatively_Learned_CNN_Embedding_for_Person_Re-identification","308278517_A_Deep_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Progressive_Vehicle_Re-identification_for_Urban_Surveillance","303760492_Large-scale_vehicle_re-identification_in_urban_surveillance_videos","300412402_Scalable_Person_Re-identification_A_Benchmark","274720744_Transferring_a_Semantic_Representation_for_Person_Re-Identification_and_Search","236593328_Large_Scale_Metric_Learning_from_Equivalence_Constraints","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","340552656_Bag_of_Tricks_and_a_Strong_Baseline_for_Deep_Person_Re-Identification","339558387_A_Dual-Path_Model_With_Adaptive_Attention_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","339558064_PAMTRI_Pose-Aware_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification_Using_Highly_Randomized_Synthetic_Data","338511943_Perceive_Where_to_Focus_Learning_Visibility-Aware_Part-Level_Features_for_Partial_Person_Re-Identification","338510247_CityFlow_A_City-Scale_Benchmark_for_Multi-Target_Multi-Camera_Vehicle_Tracking_and_Re-Identification","337230931_Group-Group_Loss_Based_Global-Regional_Feature_Learning_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","336156088_Vehicle_Re-identification_an_Efficient_Baseline_Using_Triplet_Embedding","331796122_Vehicle_Re-Identification_Using_Quadruple_Directional_Deep_Learning_Features","331158735_Embedding_Adversarial_Learning_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","329751276_Features_for_Multi-target_Multi-camera_Tracking_and_Re-identification","329750650_Viewpoint-Aware_Attentive_Multi-view_Inference_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","329740286_Diversity_Regularized_Spatiotemporal_Attention_for_Video-Based_Person_Re-identification","328245919_RAM_A_Region-Aware_Deep_Model_for_Vehicle_Re-Identification","322650282_Group_Sensitive_Triplet_Embedding_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","322060199_Deeply-Learned_Part-Aligned_Representations_for_Person_Re-identification","322059845_Learning_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Vehicle_Re-ID_with_Visual-spatio-Temporal_Path_Proposals","322058931_Efficient_Online_Local_Metric_Adaptation_via_Negative_Samples_for_Person_Re-identification","322058472_Orientation_Invariant_Feature_Embedding_and_Spatial_Temporal_Regularization_for_Vehicle_Re-identification","322058181_Cross-View_Asymmetric_Metric_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Person_Re-Identification","320971101_Spindle_Net_Person_Re-identification_with_Human_Body_Region_Guided_Feature_Decomposition_and_Fusion","320968126_One-Shot_Metric_Learning_for_Person_Re-identification","318671104_Deeply-Learned_Part-Aligned_Representations_for_Person_Re-Identification","311611367_Similarity_Learning_with_Spatial_Constraints_for_Person_Re-identification","311611186_Deep_Relative_Distance_Learning_Tell_the_Difference_between_Similar_Vehicles","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","280589906_EESEN_End-to-end_speech_recognition_using_deep_RNN_models_and_WFST-based_decoding","277672019_GrabCut"]}
