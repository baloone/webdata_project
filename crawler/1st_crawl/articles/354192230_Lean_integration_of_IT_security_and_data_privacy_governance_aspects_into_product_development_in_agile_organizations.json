{"id":"354192230_Lean_integration_of_IT_security_and_data_privacy_governance_aspects_into_product_development_in_agile_organizations","abstract":"This article deals with the design of a product development-specific framework to support lean and adequate governance. This framework is based on layers of product-specific standards and regulations. The layers can be merged into a specific set to address the demands of a product to fit the state-of-the-art requirements of its domain. For the product domain, specific layers are presented with examples from IT security and data privacy for the software development phase. The approach is generic and can be extended to other domains like finance services or embedded products and their life-cycle phases.","authors":["Alexander Poth","Mario Kottke","Kerstin Middelhauve","Torsten Mahr"],"meta":["August 2021JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE 27(8):868-893","DOI:10.3897/jucs.71770"],"references":["349759607_Strategies_to_manage_quality_requirements_in_agile_software_development_a_multiple_case_study","335358551_Implementation_of_ISO_27001_Standards_as_GDPR_Compliance_Facilitator","334485209_How_ISO_27001_Can_Help_Achieve_GDPR_Compliance","316856623_Proposal_of_a_Framework_of_Lean_Governance_and_Management_of_Enterprise_IT","316439828_Capability-Driven_Design_of_Business_Service_Ecosystem_to_Support_Risk_Governance_in_Regulatory_Ecosystems","311610986_Organizational_Agility_Key_Factors_for_Dynamic_Business_Process_Management","257289665_Shared_services_as_a_new_organisational_form_Some_implications_for_management_accounting","329484344_Understanding_RegTech_for_Digital_Regulatory_Compliance_FinTech_and_Strategy_in_the_21st_Century","319639584_Cloud_Standards_in_Comparison_Are_New_Security_Frameworks_Improving_Cloud_Security","227636322_Shared_governance_and_shared_leadership_meeting_the_challenges_of_implementation"]}
