{"id":"232742393_A_Survey_on_Clustering_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"The past few years have witnessed increased interest in the potential use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in a wide range of applications and it has become a hot research area. Based on network structure, routing protocols in WSNs can be divided into two categories: flat routing and hierarchical or clustering routing. Owing to a variety of advantages, clustering is becoming an active branch of routing technology in WSNs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and fine grained survey on clustering routing protocols proposed in the literature for WSNs. We outline the advantages and objectives of clustering for WSNs, and develop a novel taxonomy of WSN clustering routing methods based on complete and detailed clustering attributes. In particular, we systematically analyze a few prominent WSN clustering routing protocols and compare these different approaches according to our taxonomy and several significant metrics. Finally, we summarize and conclude the paper with some future directions.","authors":["Xuxun Liu"],"meta":["December 2012Sensors 12(8):11113-53","DOI:10.3390/s120811113","SourcePubMed"],"references":["312818310_Prolonging_the_lifetime_of_wireless_sensor_networks_via_unequal_clustering","266837956_Energy_Efficient_and_Balanced_Cluster-Based_Data_Aggregation_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","329319926_Data_aggregation_in_wireless_sensor_networks","313636700_Directed_diffusion_for_wireless_sensor_networking","303943280_Hierarchical_geographic_multicast_routing_for_wireless_sensor_networks","303134628_GMR_Geographic_multicast_routing_for_wireless_sensor_networks","290609677_Maximum_lifetime_algorithm_for_precise_data_gathering_based_on_tree_in_wireless_sensor_networks","284696386_Improvement_on_LEACH_Protocol_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_VLEACH","271452859_Cluster-based_routing_protocols_in_wireless_sensor_networks_A_survey","271121782_Design_Challenges_and_Comparative_Analysis_of_Cluster_Based_Routing_Protocols_Used_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Improving_Network_Life_Time","264551474_Improvement_on_LEACH_Protocol_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network","257727905_Comparison_Study_to_Hierarchical_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","266176281_Improving_on_LEACH_Protocol_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Fuzzy_Logic","261355675_APTEEN_a_hybrid_protocol_for_efficient_routing_and_comprehensive_information_retrieval_in_wireless","261240668_Energy-efficient_Geographic_Multicast_Routing_for_Error-prone_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
