{"id":"291229205_One-Relator_Maximal_Pro-_p_Galois_Groups_and_the_Koszulity_Conjectures","abstract":"Let $p$ be a prime number and let K be a field containing a root of 1 of\norder $p$. If the maximal pro-p Galois group $G_K(p)$ is a finitely generated\none-relator pro-$p$ group, we show that L. Positselski's Koszulity conjecture\nis true for $K$. Also, under the above hypothesis we show that the\n$\\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology ring of $G_K(p)$ is the quadratic dual of a canonical\ngraded algebra induced by the complete group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_p[[G_K(p)]]$,\nwhich decomposes as free product of quadratic algebras, in analogy with a\nresult by T. Wuerfel on one-relator absolute pro-$p$ Galois groups.","authors":["Claudio Quadrelli"],"meta":["January 2016The Quarterly Journal of Mathematics","DOI:10.1093/qmath/haaa049","SourcearXiv","Project: Galois cohomology and profinite groups"],"references":["348150174_Koszul_Algebras_and_Quadratic_Duals_in_Galois_Cohomology","318671195_The_Kummerian_Property_and_Maximal_Pro-p_Galois_Groups","292373910_Profinite_groups_with_a_cyclotomic_p-orientation","274012369_Finite_quotients_of_Galois_pro-p_groups_and_rigid_fields","344482898_Analytic_Pro-P_Groups","303491707_A_remark_on_the_structure_of_absolute_Galois_groups","303349483_Koszul_resolutions","300425017_Filtrations_of_free_groups_arising_from_the_lower_central_series","269997715_Cohomology_of_absolute_Galois_groups","268247605_Quadratic_algebras"]}
