{"id":"354426600_Computational_Propaganda_Challenges_and_Responses","abstract":"In recent years, the world has experienced a substantial rise of cybercrimes across many countries, and especially as a result of the digitalisation of jobs due to the various lockdowns implemented in 2020 (Riley, 2021). Technological progress will make online criminality more sophisticated and thus even more dangerous and harder to defend against. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to fight this phenomenon by adopting a variety of techniques from social and computer sciences. This essay will focus on computational propaganda, and more precisely on the use of bots on social media. The paper will first define what computational propaganda is, while highlighting its main features from different perspectives. It will later examine the challenges faced when countering online propaganda. Lastly, the essay will critically analyse and evaluate the possible responses and solutions to this issue.","authors":["Federico Alistair D'Alessio"],"meta":["September 2021","DOI:10.20935/AL3468","Project: Academia Letters"],"references":["355335659_The_Global_Disinformation_Order_2019_Global_Inventory_of_Organised_Social_Media_Manipulation","344972483_Identifying_propaganda_from_online_social_networks_during_COVID-19_using_machine_learning_techniques","344515740_Hacking_democracy_managing_influence_campaigns_and_disinformation_in_the_digital_age","343996616_Misinformation_Disinformation_and_Online_Propaganda","327209378_Weaponized_Health_Communication_Twitter_Bots_and_Russian_Trolls_Amplify_the_Vaccine_Debate","324464619_Algorithms_bots_and_political_communication_in_the_US_2016_election_The_challenge_of_automated_political_communication_for_election_law_and_administration","324193884_The_disinformation_order_Disruptive_communication_and_the_decline_of_democratic_institutions","353425445_Spreading_Propaganda_in_Cyberspace_Comparing_Cyber-Resource_Usage_of_Al_Qaeda_and_ISIS","330047294_Post-Truth_and_Political_Discourse"]}
