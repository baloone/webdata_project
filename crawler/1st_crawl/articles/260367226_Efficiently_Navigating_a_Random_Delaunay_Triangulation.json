{"id":"260367226_Efficiently_Navigating_a_Random_Delaunay_Triangulation","abstract":"Planar graph navigation is an important problem with significant implications\nto both point location in geometric data structures and routing in networks.\nHowever, whilst a number of algorithms and existence proofs have been proposed,\nvery little analysis is available for the properties of the paths generated and\nthe computational resources required to generate them under a random\ndistribution hypothesis for the input. In this paper we analyse a new\ndeterministic planar navigation algorithm with constant competitiveness which\nfollows vertex adjacencies in the Delaunay triangulation. We call this strategy\ncone walk. We prove that given $n$ uniform points in a smooth convex domain of\nunit area, and for any start point $z$ and query point $q$; cone walk applied\nto $z$ and $q$ will access at most $O(|zq|\\sqrt{n} +\\log^7 n)$ sites with\ncomplexity $O(|zq|\\sqrt{n} \\log \\log n + \\log^7 n)$ with probability tending to\n1 as $n$ goes to infinity. We additionally show that in this model, cone walk\nis $(\\log ^{3+\\xi} n)$-memoryless with high probability for any pair of start\nand query point in the domain, for any positive $\\xi$. We take special care\nthroughout to ensure our bounds are valid even when the query points are\narbitrarily close to the border.","authors":["Nicolas Broutin","Olivier Devillers","Ross Hemsley"],"meta":["February 2014Random Structures and Algorithms 49(1)","DOI:10.1002/rsa.20630","SourcearXiv"],"references":["225386633_A_Note_on_Point_Location_in_Delaunay_Triangulations_of_Random_Points","305978736_Asymptotic_of_geometrical_navigation_on_a_random_set_of_points_of_the_plane","283660741_Probabilistic_methods_for_algorithmic_discrete_mathematics","267128815_Concentration_Inequalities_A_nonasymptotic_theory_of_independence","266354976_Concentration","254211657_Asymptotic_of_geometrical_navigation_on_a_random_set_of_points_of_the_plane","252593045_Guide_to_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","247572109_Software_for_C1_Surface_Interpolation","234799288_Lectures_on_Discrete_Geometry","225313100_Online_Routing_in_Convex_Subdivisions","221343273_Geometrically_aware_communication_in_random_wireless_networks","222546692_Expected_time_analysis_for_Delaunay_point_location","221933088_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_an_Information_Processing_Approach","221150466_On_Lawson's_Oriented_Walk_in_Random_Delaunay_Triangulations","220991419_Toward_the_Tight_Bound_of_the_Stretch_Factor_of_Delaunay_Triangulations"]}
