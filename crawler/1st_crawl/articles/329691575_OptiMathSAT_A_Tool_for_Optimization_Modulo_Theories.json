{"id":"329691575_OptiMathSAT_A_Tool_for_Optimization_Modulo_Theories","abstract":"Optimization Modulo Theories (\\(\\text {OMT}\\)) is an extension of SMT which allows for finding models that optimize given objectives. OptiMathSAT is an OMT solver which allows for solving a list of optimization problems on SMT formulas with linear objective functions—on the Boolean, the rational and the integer domains, and on their combination thereof—including (partial weighted) MaxSMT . Multiple and heterogeneous objective functions can be combined together and handled either independently, or lexicographically, or in linear or min–max /max–min combinations. OptiMathSAT provides an incremental interface, it supports both an extended version of the SMT-LIBv2 language and a subset of the FlatZinc language, and can be interfaced via an API. In this paper we describe OptiMathSAT and its usage in full detail.","authors":["Roberto Sebastiani","Patrick Trentin"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Automated Reasoning 64(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10817-018-09508-6"],"references":["328542899_Invariant_Checking_of_NRA_Transition_Systems_via_Incremental_Reduction_to_LRA_with_EUF","318328389_Satisfiability_Modulo_Transcendental_Functions_via_Incremental_Linearization","301877210_Requirements_Evolution_and_Evolution_Requirements_with_Constrained_Goal_Models","301874052_Multi_Object_Reasoning_with_Constrained_Goal_Model","319339569_Solving_SAT_and_MaxSAT_with_a_Quantum_Annealer_Foundations_and_a_Preliminary_Report","315859196_On_Optimization_Modulo_Theories_MaxSMT_and_Sorting_Networks","313481073_On_Optimization_Modulo_Theories_MaxSMT_and_Sorting_Networks","312695749_Requirements_Evolution_and_Evolution_Requirements_with_Constrained_Goal_Models","301991235_nZ_-_An_Optimizing_SMT_Solver","300643480_OptiMathSAT_A_Tool_for_Optimization_Modulo_Theories","300078738_Bit-Vector_Optimization","290470007_A_Parametric_Approach_for_Smaller_and_Better_Encodings_of_Cardinality_Constraints","290009505_Interpolation-Based_Verification_of_Floating-Point_Programs_with_Abstract_CDCL","288807073_Boolean_lexicographic_optimization","287469368_Maximum_satisfiability_using_core-guided_MaxSAT_resolution"]}
