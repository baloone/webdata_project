{"id":"263799810_System_entity_structures_for_suites_of_simulation_models","abstract":"We describe how to develop a suite of models in the MS4 Modeling Environment (MS4 Me). The approach employs the operation of merging of System Entity Structures supported by the environment. After construction, the suite of models can be hosted on Model Store, the cloud-based repository of models provided by MS4 systems as a basis for further collaborative model development. A suite of models, relating to Health Care is used as an example. In this paper, we review basic concepts of the SES needed to support of suites of simulation models. We then consider the concept of multiple aspects that provides more advanced capabilities to construct and manipulate suites of models. With this background, we go on to discuss a methodology for developing suites of simulation models and cloud-based technology for storing and sharing such models in a marketplace of models. Finally, we discuss future research and developments needed to bring the marketplace into common use by modeling and simulation practitioners.","authors":["Bernard Phillip Zeigler","Chungman Seo","Doohwan Kim"],"meta":["August 2013International Journal of Modeling Simulation and Scientific Computing 04(03)","DOI:10.1142/S1793962313400060","Project: MS4 Me software development"],"references":["279924477_A_Framework_for_Simulation-Based_Structure_and_Parameter_Optimization_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","262248257_DEVS_modeling_and_simulation_methodology_with_MS4_Me_software_tool","262218804_Creating_suites_of_models_with_system_entity_structure_Global_warming_example","258188119_System_theoretic_foundations_of_modeling_and_simulation_A_historic_perspective_and_the_legacy_of_A_Wayne_Wymore","221525593_Composing_Simulations_from_XML-Specified_Model_Components","4075938_Component-based_distributed_simulations_the_way_forward","281039496_Simulation_Foundations_Methods_and_Applications","269154950_Representing_and_Constructing_System_Specifications_Using_the_System_Entity_Structure_Concepts","262369684_Automatic_generation_of_system_entity_structure_alternatives_Application_to_initial_manufacturing_facility_design","234818275_Modeling_Simulation-Based_Data_Engineering_Introducing_Pragmatics_into_Ontologies_for_Net-Centric_Information_Exchange","3113759_System_Entity_Structuring_and_Model_Base_Management"]}
