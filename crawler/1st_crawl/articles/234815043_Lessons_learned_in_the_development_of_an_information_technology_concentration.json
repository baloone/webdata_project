{"id":"234815043_Lessons_learned_in_the_development_of_an_information_technology_concentration","abstract":"During the 1997-1999 academic years, the Computer and Information Sciences Department at East Tennessee State University developed a new concentration in Information Technology. This concentration was developed in an attempt to fill a need indicated by articles in the national press, students enrolled in our other two concentrations, and our departmental advisory board. Two existing concentrations, computer science and information science, focus heavily on general programming skills, including a four semester programming sequence followed by a two semester software engineering sequence. The newest concentration includes coverage of web design and development, networking, system administration and database design and development. Since the implementation of this program starting with the Fall 1999 freshman class, the faculty have had many discussions aimed at improving this new concentration. Included in these discussions are a failure to plan for course overlap, a lack of faculty expertise in certain areas, and a better appreciation for the skills required for the types of graduates we envisioned. Due to these discussions, a major revision of this concentration was undertaken during the 2000-2001 academic year in an attempt to overcome the numerous problems that occurred along the way. The presentation of this paper will include an in depth look at these three concentrations, the problems that arose with the development of the newest of these, and the solutions implement to address these problems.","authors":["John Chenoweth"],"meta":["January 2001Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges 17(1):218-223"],"references":[]}
