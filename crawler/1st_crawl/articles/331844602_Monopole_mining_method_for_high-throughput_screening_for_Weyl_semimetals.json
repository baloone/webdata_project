{"id":"331844602_Monopole_mining_method_for_high-throughput_screening_for_Weyl_semimetals","abstract":"Although topological invariants have been introduced to classify the appearance of protected electronic states at surfaces of insulators, there are no corresponding indices for Weyl semimetals whose nodal points may appear randomly in the bulk Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we use a well-known result that every Weyl point acts as a Dirac monopole and generates integer Berry flux to search for the monopoles on rectangular BZ grids that are commonly employed in self-consistent electronic structure calculations. The method resembles data mining technology of computer science and was demonstrated on locating the Weyl points in known Weyl semimetals. It was subsequently used in high-throughput screening of several hundreds of compounds and predicting a dozen materials hosting nodal Weyl points and/or lines.","authors":["Vsevolod Ivanov","Sergey Y.
