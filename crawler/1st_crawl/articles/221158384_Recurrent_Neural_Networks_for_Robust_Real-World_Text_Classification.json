{"id":"221158384_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Robust_Real-World_Text_Classification","abstract":"This paper explores the application of recurrent neural networks for the task of robust text classification of a real-world benchmarking corpus. There are many well-established approaches which are used for text classification, but they fail to address the challenge from a more multi-disciplinary viewpoint such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The results demonstrate that these recurrent neural networks can be a viable addition to the many techniques used in web intelligence for tasks such as context sensitive email classification and web site indexing.","authors":["Garen Arevian"],"meta":["November 2007","DOI:10.1109/WI.2007.126","SourceDBLP","Conference: 2007 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence, WI 2007, 2-5 November 2007, Silicon Valley, CA, USA, Main Conference Proceedings"],"references":["224952248_Machine_Learning_in_Automated_Text_Categorization","221533136_Optimising_the_Hystereses_of_a_Two_Context_Layer_RNN_for_Text_Classification","5614197_Data_dimensionality_reduction_with_application_to_simplifying_RBF_network_structure_and_improving_classification_performance","2508166_Automated_learning_of_decision_rules_for_text_categorization","2427244_Hybrid_Neural_Plausibility_Networks_for_News_Agents","2417444_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Learning_for_Text_Routing","268892028_Support_Vector_Machines_Theory_and_Applications","249884554_An_Improved_Elman_Model_and_Recurrent_Back-Propagation_Control_Neural_Networks","247406298_Reuters21578_Test_Categorization_Test_Collection","247337512_RCV1_A_New_Text_Categorization_Test_Collection","234819712_The_SMART_Retrieval_System-Experiments_in_Automatic_Document_Processing","223117716_Buckley_C_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval_Information_Processing_Management_245_513-523","222449846_Finding_Structure_in_Time","221079479_Robust_Text_Classification_Using_a_Hysteresis-Driven_Extended_SRN","220708718_A_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Recogniser_for_Online_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Symbols","220434124_Information_Calculus_for_Information_Retrieval","220228998_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","200773081_A_Vector_Space_Model_for_Automatic_Indexing","43185280_Learning_To_Classify_Text_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","36442314_Text_Summarization_Using_Neural_Networks","2754634_Hybrid_Connectionist_Natural_Language_Processing"]}
