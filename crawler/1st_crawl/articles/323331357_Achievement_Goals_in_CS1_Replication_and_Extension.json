{"id":"323331357_Achievement_Goals_in_CS1_Replication_and_Extension","abstract":"Replication research is rare in CS education. For this reason, it is often unclear to what extent our findings generalize beyond the context of their generation. The present paper is a replication and extension of Achievement Goal Theory research on CS1 students. Achievement goals are cognitive representations of desired competence (e.g., topic mastery, outperforming peers) in achievement settings, and can predict outcomes such as grades and interest. We study achievement goals and their effects on CS1 students at six institutions in four countries. Broad patterns are maintained --- mastery goals are beneficial while appearance goals are not --- but our data additionally admits fine-grained analyses that nuance these findings. In particular, students' motivations for goal pursuit can clarify relationships between performance goals and outcomes.","authors":["Daniel Zingaro","Neena Thota","Michelle Craig","Leo Porter"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1145/3159450.3159452","Conference: the 49th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["300116921_Subgoals_Context_and_Worked_Examples_in_Learning_Computing_Problem_Solving","294277198_Comparing_Three_Models_of_Achievement_Goals_Goal_Orientations_Goal_Standards_and_Goal_Complexes","283949755_Short-term_and_Long-term_Consequences_of_Achievement_Goals_Predicting_Interest_and_Performance_over_Time","262160581_Parson's_programming_puzzles_A_fun_and_effective_learning_tool_for_first_programming_courses","233189686_Achievement_Goal_Theory_at_the_Crossroads_Old_Controversies_Current_Challenges_and_New_Directions","232424367_Short-Term_and_Long-Term_Consequences_of_Achievement_Goals_Predicting_Interest_and_Performance_Over_Time","228639100_On_the_Measurement_of_Achievement_Goals_Critique_Illustration_and_Application","220094513_Communication_in_computer_science_classrooms_Understanding_defensive_climates_as_a_means_of_creating_supportive_behaviors","44569138_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Achievement_Goal_Measures_Different_Labels_for_the_Same_Constructs_or_Different_Constructs_With_Similar_Labels","311489054_Subgoals_Help_Students_Solve_Parsons_Problems","311488382_Impact_of_Student_Achievement_Goals_on_CS1_Outcomes","310791972_Replication_in_computing_education_research_researcher_attitudes_and_experiences","304878204_A_multi-institutional_study_of_peer_instruction_in_introductory_computing","301454066_An_exploration_of_error_quotient_in_multiple_contexts","301289286_A_Multi-institutional_Study_of_Peer_Instruction_in_Introductory_Computing","282928408_Examining_Interest_and_Grades_in_Computer_Science_1_A_Study_of_Pedagogy_and_Achievement_Goals","262425643_No_tests_required_Comparing_traditional_and_dynamic_predictors_of_programming_success","260018434_Goal_self-concordance_moderates_the_relationship_between_achievement_goals_and_indicators_of_academic_adjustment","221537226_Unlocking_The_Clubhouse_Women_in_Computing"]}
