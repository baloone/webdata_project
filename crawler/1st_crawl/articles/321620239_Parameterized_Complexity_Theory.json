{"id":"321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","abstract":"Parameterized complexity theory is a recent branch of computational complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems. The central notion of the theory, fixed-parameter tractability, has led to the development of various new algorithmic techniques and a whole new theory of intractability.\nThis book is a state-of-the-art introduction to both algorithmic techniques for fixed-parameter tractability and the structural theory of parameterized complexity classes, and it presents detailed proofs of recent advanced results that have not appeared in book form before. Several chapters are each devoted to intractability, algorithmic techniques for designing fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and bounded fixed-parameter tractability and subexponential time complexity. The treatment is comprehensive, and the reader is supported with exercises, notes, a detailed index, and some background on complexity theory and logic.\nThe book will be of interest to computer scientists, mathematicians and graduate students engaged with algorithms and problem complexity.","authors":["JÃ¶rg Flum","Martin Grohe"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1007/3-540-29953-X","ISBN: 978-3-540-29952-3"],"references":[]}
