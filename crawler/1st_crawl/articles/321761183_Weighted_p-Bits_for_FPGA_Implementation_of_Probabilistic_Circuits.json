{"id":"321761183_Weighted_p-Bits_for_FPGA_Implementation_of_Probabilistic_Circuits","abstract":"Probabilistic spin logic (PSL) is a recently proposed computing paradigm based on unstable stochastic units called probabilistic bits (p-bits) that can be correlated to form probabilistic circuits (p-circuits). These p-circuits can be used to solve problems of optimization, inference and also to implement precise Boolean functions in an \"inverted\" mode, where a given Boolean circuit can operate in reverse to find the input combinations that are consistent with a given output. In this paper we present a scalable FPGA implementation of such invertible p-circuits. We implement a \"weighted\" p-bit that combines stochastic units with localized memory structures. We also present a generalized tile of weighted p-bits to which a large class of problems beyond invertible Boolean logic can be mapped.","authors":["Ahmed Zeeshan Pervaiz","Brian Sutton","Anirudh Ghantasala","Kerem Camsari"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2874565"],"references":["320723177_Implementing_p-bits_With_Embedded_MTJ","320032813_Oscillator-based_Ising_Machine","318592609_Stochastic_p_-Bits_for_Invertible_Logic","317040195_A_Survey_of_Neuromorphic_Computing_and_Neural_Networks_in_Hardware","316736472_Hardware_demonstration_of_stochastic_p-bits_for_invertible_logic","313726720_Polynomial-time_solution_of_prime_factorization_and_NP-complete_problems_with_digital_memcomputing_machines","313010314_Experimental_demonstration_of_associative_memory_with_memristive_neural_networks","312570690_FPGA-based_Annealing_Processor_for_Ising_Model","310462450_Low_Barrier_Nanomagnets_as_P-bits_for_Spin_Logic","309335373_A_fully-programmable_100-spin_coherent_Ising_machine_with_all-to-all_connections"]}
