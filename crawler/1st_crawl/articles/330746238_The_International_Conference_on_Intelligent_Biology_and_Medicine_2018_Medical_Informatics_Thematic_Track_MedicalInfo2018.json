{"id":"330746238_The_International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Biology_and_Medicine_2018_Medical_Informatics_Thematic_Track_MedicalInfo2018","abstract":"In this editorial, we first summarize the 2018 International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM 2018) that was held on June 10â€“12, 2018 in Los Angeles, California, USA, and then briefly introduce the six research articles included in this supplement issue. At ICIBM 2018, a special theme of Medical Informatics was dedicated to recent advances of data science in the medical domain. After peer review, six articles were selected in this thematic issue, covering topics such as clinical predictive modeling, clinical natural language processing (NLP), electroencephalogram (EEG) network analysis, and text mining in biomedical literature.","authors":["Yaoyun Zhang","Cui Tao","Yang Gong","Kai Wang"],"meta":["January 2019BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 19(S1)","DOI:10.1186/s12911-019-0732-0"],"references":["330749444_Epileptic_foci_localization_based_on_mapping_the_synchronization_of_dynamic_brain_network","330747927_Temporal_indexing_of_medical_entity_in_Chinese_clinical_notes","330746336_Gene_fingerprint_model_for_literature_based_detection_of_the_associations_among_complex_diseases_A_case_study_of_COPD","330746236_Early_prediction_of_acute_kidney_injury_following_ICU_admission_using_a_multivariate_panel_of_physiological_measurements","330743589_Dynamic_prediction_of_hospital_admission_with_medical_claim_data","330743497_Integrating_shortest_dependency_path_and_sentence_sequence_into_a_deep_learning_framework_for_relation_extraction_in_clinical_text"]}
