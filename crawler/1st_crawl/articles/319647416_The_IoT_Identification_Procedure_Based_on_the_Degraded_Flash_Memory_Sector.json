{"id":"319647416_The_IoT_Identification_Procedure_Based_on_the_Degraded_Flash_Memory_Sector","abstract":"The article presents general principles of IoT identification on the basis of the degraded bucket of NOR flash memory used in network devices for storing microprograms. We proposed the identification procedure based on the sector of forcibly degraded flash memory and considered variants of its application for identifying network devices. The proposed identification method can be used both on the basis of chips already existing in network devices and on the basis of embedded units specially designed for identification.","authors":["Sergey Vladimirov","Ruslan Kirichek"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-67380-6_6","Conference: International Conference on Next Generation Wired/Wireless Networking Conference on Internet of Things and Smart Spaces International Workshop on Nano-scale Computing and Communications"],"references":["285602843_Extracting_Robust_Keys_from_NAND_Flash_Physical_Unclonable_Functions","221291904_RF-DNA_Radio-Frequency_Certificates_of_Authenticity","2986127_Introduction_to_Flash_memory","301710668_False_clouds_for_Internet_of_Things_and_methods_of_protection","300416897_False_clouds_for_Internet_of_Things_and_methods_of_protection","300329420_Internet_of_Things_Laboratory_Test_Bed","241633665_Flash_Memory_for_Ubiquitous_Hardware_Security_Functions_True_Random_Number_Generation_and_Device_Fingerprints"]}
