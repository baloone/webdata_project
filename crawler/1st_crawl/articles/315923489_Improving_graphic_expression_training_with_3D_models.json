{"id":"315923489_Improving_graphic_expression_training_with_3D_models","abstract":"Spatial vision is critical to understanding all other knowledge to be taught in all technical fields. Students need the ability to determine the three-dimensional shape of an object from its two-dimensional graphic representation. After using drawings in both two and three dimensions on the backboard, an opportunity to use digital media in various more interactive ways is proposed to change the ways in which the content is presented. Such digital tools include augmented reality, PDF3D or 3D visualization software like SketchUp. This article shows how 3D ICT objects can help communication for the compression of terrains represented by contours when they are not completely understood. It also discusses how to proceed to obtain them and the advantages and disadvantages of the three ways of visualization chosen. Conducting classes in Vocational training with the help of 3D models can ensure the achievement of the general objectives of the course of work with contours; with graphic origin, (obtaining profiles, earthworks, embankments, design vials or zoning), or mathematical origin, (sloping, modules, height differences, dimensions). The evaluation of these elements has been done to observe their acceptance and usability, not only in an educational environment, but also in a professional environment, since these models have been used to develop projects of urbanization, in internships in companies in real environments to explain these projects to customers.\n\nGraphical Abstract\nOpen image in new window","authors":["Ayala Alvarez Francisco Javier","E.
