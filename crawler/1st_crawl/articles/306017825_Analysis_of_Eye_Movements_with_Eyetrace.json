{"id":"306017825_Analysis_of_Eye_Movements_with_Eyetrace","abstract":"In the time of affordable and comfortable video-based eye tracking, the need for analysis software becomes more and more important. We introduce Eyetrace, a new software developed for the analysis of eye-tracking data during static image viewing. The aim of the software is to provide a platform for eye-tracking data analysis which works with different eye trackers, offering thus the possibility to compare results beyond the specific characteristics of the hardware devices. Furthermore, by integrating various state-of-the-art and new developed algorithms for analysis and visualization of eye-tracking data, the influence of different analysis steps and parameter choices on typical eye-tracking measures is totally transparent to the user. Eyetrace integrates several algorithms to identify fixations and saccades, and to cluster them. Well-established algorithms can be used side-by-side with bleeding-edge approaches with a continuous visualization. Eyetrace can be downloaded at http:// www. ti. uni-tuebingen. de/ Eyetrace. 1751. 0. html and we encourage its use for exploratory data analysis and education.","authors":["Thomas C KÃ¼bler","Katrin Sippel","Wolfgang Fuhl","Guilherme Schievelbein"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-27707-3_28","Conference: International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies","Project: Eyetrace 2014 - Eye tracking evaluation algorithms"],"references":["270653341_Describing_Art_-_An_Interdisciplinary_Approach_to_the_Effects_of_Speaking_on_Gaze_Movements_during_the_Beholding_of_Paintings","267933462_Homonymous_Visual_Field_Loss_and_Its_Impact_on_Visual_Exploration_A_Supermarket_Study","265830368_Abstract_Art_as_a_Universal_Language","265095015_Binocular_Glaucomatous_Visual_Field_Loss_and_Its_Impact_on_Visual_Exploration_-_A_Supermarket_Study","260170800_Driving_with_Binocular_Visual_Field_Loss_A_Study_on_a_Supervised_On-Road_Parcours_with_Simultaneous_Eye_and_Head_Tracking","225080802_It_depends_on_how_you_look_at_it_Scanpath_comparison_in_multiple_dimensions_with_MultiMatch_a_vector-based_approach","220811146_Identifying_fixations_and_saccades_in_eye-tracking_protocols","24415626_Fixation_identification_The_optimum_threshold_for_a_dispersion_algorithm","281992868_Towards_automated_comparison_of_eye-tracking_recordings_in_dynamic_scenes","265417727_Online_Recognition_of_Fixations_Saccades_and_Smooth_Pursuits_for_Automated_Analysis_of_Traffic_Hazard_Perception","262062550_The_Applicability_of_Probabilistic_Methods_to_the_Online_Recognition_of_Fixations_and_Saccades_in_Dynamic_Scenes","259295578_Online_Classification_of_Eye_Tracking_Data_for_Automated_Analysis_of_Traffic_Hazard_Perception","258146386_Saccadic_Eye_Movement_Metrics_Reflect_Surgical_Residents'_Fatigue","254007934_Gaze_behaviour_of_expert_and_novice_microneurosurgeons_differs_during_observations_of_tumor_removal_recordings","254007900_Bayesian_online_clustering_of_eye_movement_data","221031325_Vishnoo-An_open-source_software_for_vision_research","220811050_Robust_clustering_of_eye_movement_recordings_for_quantification_of_visual_interest","41808585_Monitoring_Vigilance_during_Perimetry_by_Using_Pupillography"]}
