{"id":"335891104_Using_scaffold_innovation-thinking_frameworks_to_integrate_food_science_and_technology_into_the_transdisciplinary_engineering_design_classroom","abstract":"Abstract Technology and innovation are essential for students to not only learn and understand the technical skills, but also identify a problem, discover a solution, and communicate the value proposition. In this study, innovation-thinking frameworks were integrated into undergraduate transdisciplinary engineering and technology classrooms with a topic of food science and technology, exploring design within the area of new product development. The qualitative analysis, conducted using NVivo, indicated that the food science and technology focused educational experiences had the potential of transforming student self-reported perspectives related to metacognitive reflection, connecting the topics to the real-world and communicating. The findings offer exciting insights into the benefit of integrating self-regulated learning, visualization, and communication technology into future food-related education programs.","authors":["Lisa Bosman","Sangjun Eom"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.1186/s41239-019-0165-y"],"references":["325613844_Writing_a_Recipe_for_Teaching_Sustainable_Food_Systems_Lessons_from_Three_University_Courses","315550859_Elements_of_Entrepreneurially_Minded_Learning_KEEN_White_Paper","274654035_Sustainable_Agriculture_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_A_Land-Grant_University_Mission","322170775_Teaching_the_Entrepreneurial_Mindset_to_Engineers","316440434_An_emerging_signature_pedagogy_for_sustainable_food_systems_education","311622612_Taking_the_Challenge_for_Real_Food_Student_Engagement_in_Procuring_Sustainably_Produced_Food_on_Campus","286945251_Re-visioning_agriculture_in_higher_education_the_role_of_campus_agriculture_initiatives_in_sustainability_education","279951996_Reason_and_Reenchantment_in_Cultural_Change_Sustainability_in_Higher_Education","276089652_Integrating_Innovation_and_Entrepreneurship_Principles_into_the_Civil_Engineering_Curriculum","273689069_Walking_the_Talk_of_Food_Systems_at_a_Small_Land-Grant_University_Overcoming_Process_Barriers_to_a_Transdisciplinary_Approach"]}
