Whom do students tend to consult for research assistance? In-depth interviews conducted with 15 undergraduate and graduate students were thematically analyzed through a three-step process. The findings indicate that students are most likely to consult faculty and peers for assistance and are largely unaware of librarians' roles, while they tend to begin research using library databases and do not necessarily start with Google. In addition, student use of small study groups as learning networks and reliance upon alternate sites to conduct research emerged as unanticipated themes.","authors":["Susan Thomas","Eamon Tewell","Gloria Willson"],"meta":["March 2017The Journal of Academic Librarianship 43(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.acalib.2017.02.016"],"references":["254238429_Ambience_in_social_learning_Student_engagement_with_new_designs_for_learning_spaces","235298548_Undergraduates'_academic_information_and_library_behaviors_Preliminary_results","43294507_Do_academic_enquiry_services_scare_students","24419737_Early_Sensorineural_Hearing_Loss_in_ObOb_Mouse_an_Animal_Model_of_Type_2_Diabetes","302059766_How_Do_Students_Get_Help_with_Research_Assignments_Using_Drawings_to_Understand_Students'_Help_Seeking_Behavior","283140698_Does_telling_them_to_ask_for_help_work_Investigating_library_help-seeking_behaviors_in_college_undergraduates","271635176_You_Just_Type_in_What_You_Are_Looking_For_Undergraduates'_Use_of_Library_Resources_vs_Wikipedia","271258552_Closing_the_Gap","249901712_Comfort_and_Convenience_Why_Students_Choose_Alternatives_to_the_Library","222638938_The_Library_Is_for_Studying_Student_Preferences_for_Study_Space","222036119_Convenience_or_credibility_A_study_of_college_student_research_behaviors"]}
