{"id":"326017771_The_effectiveness_of_public_health_advertisements_to_promote_health_a_randomized-controlled_trial_on_794000_participants","abstract":"Online advertising: healthier ads promote healthier living People who see specific health-promoting messages after searching online for weight-related terms are more likely to subsequently search for information on weight loss interventions. A team led by Elad Yom-Tov from Microsoft Research Israel in Herzeliya conducted a randomized trial involving 794,000 users of the Bing search engine who queried terms related to weight, diet, and exercise. Randomly chosen subjects were shown advertisements designed to promote healthy living, while all other users were shown standard ads. The researchers found that 48% of people exposed to the health-promoting advertisements made searches within the next month for weight loss information, compared with only 32% of those in the control group. The findings suggest that targeted online messaging can help change population health behaviors.","authors":["Elad Yom-Tov","Jinia Shembekar","Sarah Barclay","Peter Muennig"],"meta":["December 2018npj Digital Medicine 1(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41746-018-0031-7"],"references":["320642529_Adverse_Reactions_Associated_With_Cannabis_Consumption_as_Evident_From_Search_Engine_Queries","310665022_Web-Based_Antismoking_Advertising_to_Promote_Smoking_Cessation_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","280124446_Big_Data_for_Health","275640660_Exploring_Time-Dependent_Concerns_About_Pregnancy_and_Childbirth_from_Search_Logs","345843081_Crowdsourced_Health_How_What_You_Do_on_the_Internet_Will_Improve_Medicine","317212996_Policy_and_population_behavior_in_the_age_of_Big_Data","314006872_Advances_In_Public_Communication_Campaigns","275061568_Big_other_Surveillance_Capitalism_and_the_Prospects_of_an_Information_Civilization","272839732_Enduring_and_Emerging_Challenges_of_Informed_Consent","271919867_Online_ads_and_offline_sales_Measuring_the_effect_of_retail_advertising_via_a_controlled_experiment_on_Yahoo"]}
