The maximization of the objective function of a computational problem is a crucial problem in gate-model quantum computers. The objective function estimation is a high-cost procedure that requires several rounds of quantum computations and measurements. Here, we define a method for objective function estimation of arbitrary computational problems in gate-model quantum computers. The proposed solution significantly reduces the costs of the objective function estimation and provides an optimized estimate of the state of the quantum computer for solving optimization problems.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi"],"meta":["August 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-71007-9"],"references":["349577854_Development_of_Quantum_Interconnects_QuICs_for_Next-Generation_Information_Technologies","349205834_Quantum_capacity_analysis_of_multi-level_amplitude_damping_channels","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","343343117_Dynamics_of_entangled_networks_of_the_quantum_Internet","343157224_Experimental_kernel-based_quantum_machine_learning_in_finite_feature_space","343025488_Routing_space_exploration_for_scalable_routing_in_the_quantum_Internet","342769180_Circuit_Depth_Reduction_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","343719017_Massively_parallel_classical_logic_via_coherent_dynamics_of_an_ensemble_of_quantum_systems_with_dispersion_in_size","343433890_Quantum_Device_Emulates_Dynamics_of_Two_Coupled_Oscillators"]}
