{"id":"223415674_A_survey_analysis_of_service_quality_for_domestic_airlines","abstract":"This paper presents an effective approach for evaluating service quality of domestic passenger airlines by customer surveys. To reflect the inherent subjectiveness and imprecision of the customers' perceptions to the quality levels provided by airlines with respect to multiple service attributes, crisp survey results are represented and processed as fuzzy sets. A fuzzy multicriteria analysis (MA) model is used to formulate the evaluation problem. The model is solved by an effective algorithm which incorporates the decision maker's attitude or preference for customers' assessments on criteria weights and performance ratings. An empirical study of domestic airlines on a highly competitive route in Taiwan is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The evaluation outcome provides airlines with their internal and external competitive advantages, relative to competitors in terms of customer-perceived quality levels of service.","authors":["Yu-Hern Chang","Chung-Hsing Yeh"],"meta":["February 2002European Journal of Operational Research 139(1):166-177","DOI:10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00148-5"],"references":["279343739_Fuzzy_Sets_Decision_Making_and_Expert_Systems","270456323_A_Longitudinal_Analysis_of_the_Impact_of_Service_Changes_on_Customer_Attitudes","267067828_Fuzzy_Set_Theory_-_and_Its_Applications","258232687_Note_on_C_functions_with_the_zero_property","233522386_A_Service_Quality_Model_and_Its_Marketing_Implications","227442174_What_You_DON'T_Know_About_Customer-Perceived_Quality_The_Role_of_Customer_Expectation_Distributions","225083670_A_Conceptual_Model_of_Service_Quality_and_its_Implication_for_Future_Research_SERVQUAL","200827786_SERVQUAL_A_Multiple-item_Scale_for_Measuring_Consumer_Perceptions_of_Service_Quality","289928263_Assessing_Service_Quality_as_an_Effective_Management_Tool_The_Case_of_the_Airline_Industry","288867394_Perception_paradox_Airline_service_quality_issues","285831892_Toward_management_of_transportation_service_quality","284462342_Fuzzy_Sets_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes","284387910_Identifying_service_gaps_in_commercial_air_travel_The_first_step_toward_quality_improvement","283970571_Evaluating_service_quality_and_productivity_in_the_regional_airline_industry","283032943_Establishing_a_measure_of_airline_preference_for_business_and_nonbusiness_travelers_Vancouver","271847439_Multiple_Criteria_Decision-Making_Multiattribute_Utility-Theory_-_the_Next_10_Years","269526953_Assessment_of_the_Relationship_Between_Productivity_and_Performance_Quality_in_the_US_Domestic_Airline_Industry","265694937_Why_Satisfied_Customers_Defect","251880089_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Making_Kyoto_1975","249700421_Competition_Fares_and_Fences--_Perspective_of_the_Air_Traveler","248007072_The_Service_Encounter-Diagnosing_Favorable_and_Unfavorable_Incidents","247495680_Service_Management_and_Marketing_Managing_the_Moments_of_Truth_in","246940515_New_similarity_measures_on_fuzzy_sets_and_on_elements","245280804_Multi-criteria_analysis_for_dredger_dispatching_under_uncertainty","243769921_Introduction_to_Fuzzy_Arithmetic_Theory_and_Applications","242021358_Strategies_for_Reducing_Perceptions_of_Quality_Risk_in_Services","238761193_Multiple_attribute_decision_making_Methods_and_applications_A_state-of-_the-art_survey","235357045_Service_Quality_and_Customer_Loyalty_in_the_Commercial_Airline_Industry","235290168_On_choosing_between_fuzzy_subsets","234819798_Fuzzy_Multiple_Attribute_Decision_Making_Methods_and_Applications","228930390_Multiple_criteria_decision_making_Eight_concepts_of_optimality","224112343_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_SMC_vol3128-45","222726267_Task_oriented_weighting_in_multi-criteria_analysis","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222054326_A_Service_Quality_model_of_Air_Travel_Demand_An_Empirical_Study","222031459_An_efficient_approach_to_solving_fuzzy_MADM_problem","35738627_An_empirical_investigation_of_passenger_diversity_airline_service_quality_and_passenger_satisfaction","23793825_A_critical_survey_on_the_status_of_multiple_criteria_decision_making","4943276_A_multi-criteria_evaluation_of_diseases_in_a_study_for_public-health_planning","4943272_After_the_fuzzy_wave_reached_Europe","4867560_Fuzzy_MCDM_based_on_ideal_and_anti-ideal_concepts","3421222_Maximizing_sets_and_fuzzy_Markoff_algorithms"]}
