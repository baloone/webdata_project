{"id":"280911982_A_High-Level_Modeling_Language_for_the_Efficient_Design_Implementation_and_Testing_of_Android_Applications","abstract":"Developing mobile applications remains difficult, time consuming, and\nerror-prone, in spite of the number of existing platforms and tools. In this\npaper, we define MoDroid, a high-level modeling language to ease the\ndevelopment of Android applications. MoDroid allows developing models\nrepresenting the core of applications. MoDroid provides Android programmers\nwith the following advantages: (1) Models are built using high-level primitives\nthat abstract away several implementation details; (2) It allows the definition\nof interfaces between models to automatically compose them; (3) Java native\nandroid can be automatically generated along with the required permissions; (4)\nIt supports efficient model-based testing that operates on models. MoDroid is\nfully implemented and was used to develop several non-trivial Android\napplications.","authors":["John Abou-Jaoudeh","Kinan Dak-Al-Bab","Mostafa El-Katerji","Yli√®s Falcone"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer 20(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10009-016-0441-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266652884_PScout_Analyzing_the_Android_permission_specification","264129149_Towards_a_Mobile_Application_Performance_Benchmark","261315380_Comparison_of_cross-platform_mobile_development_tools","261208093_Towards_a_Modular_and_Lightweight_Model_for_Android_Development_Platforms","291413168_Apposcopy_Semantic-based_detection_of_android_malware_through_static_analysis","284197133_Comprehensive_Multi-platform_Dynamic_Program_Analysis_for_Java_and_Android","275375137_MobiGUITAR_--_A_Tool_for_Automated_Model-Based_Testing_of_Mobile_Apps","266496412_From_Models_to_Code_with_the_Eclipse_Modeling_Framework","264922652_EMF_Eclipse_Modeling_Framework_20_2nd_Edition","262281109_A_Grey-Box_Approach_for_Automated_GUI-Model_Generation_of_Mobile_Applications"]}
