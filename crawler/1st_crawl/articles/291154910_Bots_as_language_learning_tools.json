{"id":"291154910_Bots_as_language_learning_tools","abstract":"Foreign Language Learning (FLL) students commonly have few opportunities to use their target language. Teachers in FLL situations do their best to create opportunities during classes through pair or group work, but a variety of factors ranging from a lack of time to shyness or limited opportunity for quality feedback hamper this. This paper discusses online chatbots' potential role in fulfilling this need. Chatbots could provide a means of language practice for students anytime and virtually anywhere. 211 students used two well-known bots in class and their feedback was recorded with a brief written survey. Most students enjoyed using the chatbots. They also generally felt more comfortable conversing with the bots than a student partner or teacher. This is a budding technology that has up to now been designed primarily for native speakers of English. In their present state chatbots are generally only useful for advanced and/or very keen language students. However, means exist now for language teachers to get involved and bring this technology into the FLL classroom as a permanent tool for language practice.","authors":["Luke Fryer","Rollo Carpenter"],"meta":["September 2006Language, Learning and Technology 10(3):8-14"],"references":[]}
