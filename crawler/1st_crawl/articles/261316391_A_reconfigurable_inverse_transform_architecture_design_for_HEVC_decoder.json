{"id":"261316391_A_reconfigurable_inverse_transform_architecture_design_for_HEVC_decoder","abstract":"In this paper, we present a reconfigurable hardware design which can support the inverse transform size from 4×4 to 32×32 in HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding). We explore the coefficient properties of various inverse transforms such that a base inverse transform unit can be reconfigured or refined to generate other size of inverse transform. The implementation in 90nm technology can support 3840×2160@30fps processing and only needs about 133.8K gate count, which can save 53% of gate count when compared with previous work.","authors":["Pai-Tse Chiang","Tian Sheuan Chang"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572019","Conference: Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), 2013 IEEE International Symposium on"],"references":["256491462_CE10_Core_transform_design_for_HEVC","266416357_2-D_large_inverse_transform_16x16_3232_for_HEVC_High_Efficiency_Video_Coding","2986360_Video_Compression_-_From_Concepts_to_the_H264AVC_Standard"]}
