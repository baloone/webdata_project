{"id":"313487696_Reversible_Data_Hiding_Based_on_DNA_Computing","abstract":"Biocomputing, especially DNA, computing has got great development. It is widely used in information security. In this paper, a novel algorithm of reversible data hiding based on DNA computing is proposed. Inspired by the algorithm of histogram modification, which is a classical algorithm for reversible data hiding, we combine it with DNA computing to realize this algorithm based on biological technology. Compared with previous results, our experimental results have significantly improved the ER (Embedding Rate). Furthermore, some PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratios) of test images are also improved. Experimental results show that it is suitable for protecting the copyright of cover image in DNA-based information security.","authors":["Bin Wang","Yingjie Xie","Shihua Zhou","Changjun Zhou"],"meta":["February 2017Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 2017:1-9","DOI:10.1155/2017/7276084"],"references":["271573166_Enforcing_logical_delays_in_DNA_computing_systems","269725589_Reversible_Image_Data_Hiding_with_Contrast_Enhancement","266746009_A_Novel_Bio-Sensor_Based_on_DNA_Strand_Displacement","259077000_Reversible_Data_Hiding","271918496_Molecular_solutions_for_minimum_and_exact_cover_problems_in_the_tile_assembly_model","264006920_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_JPEG_Bitstream","262194493_A_reversible_acoustic_data_hiding_method_based_on_analog_modulation","261028497_An_Unsupervised_Spectral_Matching_Classifier_Based_on_Artificial_DNA_Computing_for_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","260995655_Reversible_data_hiding_for_depth_maps_using_the_depth_no-synthesis-error_model","259448199_DNA_strand_generation_for_DNA_computing_by_using_a_multi-objective_differential_evolution_algorithm"]}
