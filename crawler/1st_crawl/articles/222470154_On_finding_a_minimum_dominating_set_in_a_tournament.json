{"id":"222470154_On_finding_a_minimum_dominating_set_in_a_tournament","abstract":"The problem of finding a minimum dominating set in a tournament can be solved in nO(log n) time. It is shown that if this problem has a polynomial-time algorithm, then for every constant C, there is also a polynomial-time algorithm for the satisfiability problem of boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form with m clauses and C log2m variables. On the other hand, the problem can be reduced in polynomial time to a general satisfiability problem of length L with O(log2L) variables. Another relation between the satisfiability problem and the minimum dominating set in a tournament says that the former can be solved in 2O(âˆšv)nK time (where v is the number of variables, n is the length of the formula, and K is a constant) if and only if the latter has a polynomial-time algorithm.","authors":["Nimrod Megiddo","Uzi Vishkin"],"meta":["November 1988Theoretical Computer Science 61(2-3):307-316","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(88)90131-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["260025353_The_distribution_of_prime_numbers","265462155_Topics_In_Tournaments","265374737_On_a_Problem_in_Graph_Theory","264955125_A_Constructive_Solution_to_a_Tournament_Problem","259370359_An_extremal_problem_in_graph_theory","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220618427_Finding_a_Maximum_Independent_Set","220617804_Refining_Nondeterminism_in_Relativized_Polynomial-Time_Bounded_Computations"]}
