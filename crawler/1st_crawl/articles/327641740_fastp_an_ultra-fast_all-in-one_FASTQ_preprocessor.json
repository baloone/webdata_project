{"id":"327641740_fastp_an_ultra-fast_all-in-one_FASTQ_preprocessor","abstract":"Motivation\nQuality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient.\n\nResults\nWe developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2â€“5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations than similar tools.\n\nAvailability and implementation\nThe open-source code and corresponding instructions are available at https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp.","authors":["Shifu Chen","Yanqing Zhou","Yaru Chen","Jia Gu"],"meta":["September 2018Bioinformatics 34(17):i884-i890","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560","Project: OpenGene - perfect open source tools and libraries for analyzing NGS data."],"references":["321635001_SOAPnuke_A_MapReduce_Acceleration_supported_Software_for_integrated_Quality_Control_and_Preprocessing_of_High-Throughput_Sequencing_Data","315059228_AfterQC_Automatic_filtering_trimming_error_removing_and_quality_control_for_fastq_data","312659378_The_Emerging_Role_of_Liquid_Biopsies_Circulating_Tumor_Cells_and_Circulating_Cell-Free_Tumor_DNA_in_Lung_Cancer_Diagnosis_and_Identification_of_Resistance_Mutations","312544233_UMI-tools_Modeling_sequencing_errors_in_Unique_Molecular_Identifiers_to_improve_quantification_accuracy","280059479_Noninvasive_Prenatal_Testing_and_Incidental_Detection_of_Occult_Maternal_Malignancies","315864943_Noninvasive_Prenatal_Testing_and_Incidental_Detection_of_Occult_Maternal_Malignancies","299475217_Integrated_digital_error_suppression_for_improved_detection_of_circulating_tumor_DNA","281238574_FastQC_A_Quality_Control_tool_for_High_Throughput_Sequence_Data","280968581_SpeedSeq_Ultra-fast_personal_genome_analysis_and_interpretation","275410470_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools"]}
