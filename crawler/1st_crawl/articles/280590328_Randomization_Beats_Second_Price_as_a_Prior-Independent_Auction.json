{"id":"280590328_Randomization_Beats_Second_Price_as_a_Prior-Independent_Auction","abstract":"Designing revenue optimal auctions for selling an item to $n$ symmetric\nbidders is a fundamental problem in mechanism design. Myerson (1981) shows that\nthe second price auction with an appropriate reserve price is optimal when\nbidders' values are drawn i.i.d. from a known regular distribution. A\ncornerstone in the prior-independent revenue maximization literature is a\nresult by Bulow and Klemperer (1996) showing that the second price auction\nwithout a reserve achieves $(n-1)/n$ of the optimal revenue in the worst case.\nWe construct a randomized mechanism that strictly outperforms the second\nprice auction in this setting. Our mechanism inflates the second highest bid\nwith a probability that varies with $n$. For two bidders we improve the\nperformance guarantee from $0.5$ to $0.512$ of the optimal revenue. We also\nresolve a question in the design of revenue optimal mechanisms that have access\nto a single sample from an unknown distribution. We show that a randomized\nmechanism strictly outperforms all deterministic mechanisms in terms of worst\ncase guarantee.","authors":["Hu Fu","Nicole Immolica","Brendan Lucier","Philipp Strack"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1145/2764468.2764489","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271855544_The_Sample_Complexity_of_Revenue_Maximization","263811661_Making_the_Most_of_Your_Samples","254005663_Supply-limiting_mechanisms","234028537_Prior-independent_Auctions_for_Risk-averse_Agents","313100149_Optimal_auction_design","312538489_Revenue_maximization_with_a_single_sample","279843673_Optimal_Parametric_Auctions","279840210_Optimal_and_Efficient_Parametric_Auctions","262937388_Optimal_Auctions_for_Correlated_Buyers_with_Sampling","221445047_Revenue_maximization_with_a_single_sample"]}
