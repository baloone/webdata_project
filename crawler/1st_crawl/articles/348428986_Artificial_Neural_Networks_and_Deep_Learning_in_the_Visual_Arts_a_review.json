{"id":"348428986_Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning_in_the_Visual_Arts_a_review","abstract":"In this article, we perform an exhaustive analysis of the use of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning in the Visual Arts. We begin by introducing changes in Artificial Intelligence over the years and examine in depth the latest work carried out in prediction, classification, evaluation, generation, and identification through Artificial Neural Networks for the different Visual Arts. While we highlight the contributions of photography and pictorial art, there are also other uses for 3D modeling, including video games, architecture, and comics. The results of the investigations discussed show that the use of Artificial Neural Networks in the Visual Arts continues to evolve and have recently experienced significant growth. To complement the text, we include a glossary and table with information about the most commonly employed image datasets.","authors":["Iria Santos","Mª Luz Castro Pena","Nereida Rodriguez-Fernandez","Alvaro Torrente-Patiño"],"meta":["January 2021Neural Computing and Applications 33(1):1-37","DOI:10.1007/s00521-020-05565-4"],"references":["346469362_RANSAC-Flow_Generic_Two-Stage_Image_Alignment","342547262_Revisiting_Image_Aesthetic_Assessment_via_Self-Supervised_Feature_Learning","338742321_Towards_a_Tool_for_Visual_Link_Retrieval_and_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Painting_Datasets","338726419_Artist-based_painting_classification_using_Markov_random_fields_with_convolution_neural_network","355278297_Multiple_instance_learning_on_deep_features_for_weakly_supervised_object_detection_with_extreme_domain_shifts","345360827_Deep_CNN-Based_Speech_Balloon_Detection_and_Segmentation_for_Comic_Books","340546845_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Music_Sound_Art_and_Design_9th_International_Conference_EvoMUSART_2020_Held_as_Part_of_EvoStar_2020_Seville_Spain_April_15-17_2020_Proceedings_9th_International_Conference_E","340323468_Artificial_neural_networks_in_neurorehabilitation_A_scoping_review","339557991_Learning_Two-View_Correspondences_and_Geometry_Using_Order-Aware_Network","339506576_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","338516289_Application_of_artificial_neural_networks_for_automated_analysis_of_cystoscopic_images_a_review_of_the_current_status_and_future_prospects","338509793_Scene_Graph_Generation_With_External_Knowledge_and_Image_Reconstruction","338507035_Discovering_Visual_Patterns_in_Art_Collections_With_Spatially-Consistent_Feature_Learning","338503798_Graphical_Contrastive_Losses_for_Scene_Graph_Parsing","338424598_Attention-guided_CNN_for_image_denoising"]}
