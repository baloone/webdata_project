{"id":"268244004_Algorithms_and_Theory_of_Computation_Handbook","abstract":"Algorithms and Theory of Computation Handbook, Second Edition provides an up-to-date compendium of fundamental computer science topics and techniques. It also illustrates how the topics and techniques come together to deliver efficient solutions to important practical problems. New to the Second EditionAlong with updating and revising many of the existing chapters, this second edition contains more than 20 new chapters. This edition now covers external memory, parameterized, self-stabilizing, and pricing algorithms as well as the theories of algorithmic coding, privacy and anonymity, databases, computational games, and communication networks. It also discusses computational topology, computational number theory, natural language processing, and grid computing and explores applications in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, voting, DNA research, systems biology, and financial derivatives. This best-selling handbook continues to help computer professionals and engineers find significant information on various algorithmic topics. The expert contributors clearly define the terminology, present basic results and techniques, and offer a number of current references to the in-depth literature. They also provide a glimpse of the major research issues concerning the relevant topics.","authors":["M.J. Atallah"],"meta":["January 1998","DOI:10.1201/9781420049503"],"references":[]}
