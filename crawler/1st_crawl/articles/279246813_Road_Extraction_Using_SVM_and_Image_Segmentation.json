{"id":"279246813_Road_Extraction_Using_SVM_and_Image_Segmentation","abstract":"In this paper, a unique approach for road extraction utilizing pixel spectral information for classification and image segmentation-derived object features was developed. In this approach, road extraction was performed in two steps. In the first step, support vector machine (SVM)\nwas employed merely to classify the image into two groups of categories: a road group and a non-road group. For this classification, support vector machine (SVM) achieved higher accuracy than Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML). In the second step, the road group image was segmented\ninto geometrically homogeneous objects using a region growing technique based on a similarity criterion, with higher weighting on shape factors over spectral criteria. A simple thresholding on the shape index and density features derived from these objects was performed to extract road features,\nwhich were further processed by thinning and vectorization to obtain road centerlines. The experiment showed the proposed approach worked well with images comprised by both rural and urban area features.","authors":["Mingjun Song","Daniel Civco"],"meta":["December 2004Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 70(12):1365-1371","DOI:10.14358/PERS.70.12.1365"],"references":["226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","224377903_Rule-based_interpretation_of_aerial_imagery_IEEE_PAMI_7_570-585","220351451_Road_Network_Extraction_from_High_Resolution_Airborne_Digital_Camera_Data","3803218_Support_vector_machines_for_land_usage_classification_in_Landsat_TM_imagery","3308255_Active_contour_model_with_gradient_directional_information_Directional_snake","2408895_Dynamic_Node_Distribution_in_Adaptive_Snakes_for_Road_Extraction","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","230642382_Map-aided_structural_analysis_of_aerial_images","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","3192569_Automatic_finding_main_roads_in_aerial_images_by_using_geometric-stochastic_models_and_estimation","2405156_Automatic_Road_Detection_In_Grayscale_Aerial_Images"]}
