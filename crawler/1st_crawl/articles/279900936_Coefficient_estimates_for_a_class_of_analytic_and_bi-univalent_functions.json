{"id":"279900936_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_class_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce and investigate an interesting subclass Bh,p;∑ of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk U. For functions belonging to the class Bh;∑p we obtain estimates on the first two Taylor-Maclaurin coefficients |a2| and |a3|. The results presented in this paper would generalize and improve some recent work of Brannan and Taha.","authors":["Serap Bulut"],"meta":["January 2013Novi Sad Journal of Mathematics 43(2):59-65"],"references":["220318170_Certain_subclasses_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","266049714_On_some_classes_of_bi-univalent_functions","257293990_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions"]}
