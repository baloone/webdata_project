{"id":"256822681_Efficient_Euclidean_distance_transform_algorithm_of_binary_images_in_arbitrary_dimensions","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, i.e., PBEDT, for short, to compute the exact Euclidean distance transform (EDT) of a binary image in arbitrary dimensions. The PBEDT is based on independent scan and implemented in a recursive way, i.e., the EDT of a d-dimensional image is able to be computed from the EDTs of its (d−1)-dimensional(d−1)-dimensional sub-images. In each recursion, all of the rows in the current dimensional direction are processed one by one. The points in the current processing row and their closest feature points in (d−1)-dimensional(d−1)-dimensional sub-images can be shown in a Euclidean plane. By using the geometric properties of the perpendicular bisector, the closest feature points of (d−1)-dimensional(d−1)-dimensional sub-images are easily verified so as to lead to the EDT of a d-dimensional image after eliminating the invalid points. The time complexity of the PBEDT algorithm is linear in the amount of both image points and dimensions with a small coefficient. Compared with the state-of-the-art EDT algorithms, the PBEDT algorithm is much faster and more stable in most cases.","authors":["Jun Wang","Ying Tan"],"meta":["January 2013Pattern Recognition 46(1):230–242","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2012.07.030"],"references":["247444117_2D_Euclidean_distance_transform_algorithms_A_comparative_survey","227231655_A_General_Algorithm_For_Computing_Distance_Transforms_In_Linear_Time","222648347_Image_Registration_Methods_A_Survey","222477230_Fast_computation_of_the_Euclidian_distance_maps_for_binary_images","221364652_Efficient_Euclidean_distance_transform_using_perpendicular_bisector_segmentation","220792140_Parallel_Banding_Algorithm_to_Compute_Exact_Distance_Transform_with_the_GPU","220430836_Pfalz_JL_Sequential_Operations_in_Digital_Picture_Processing_Journal_of_the_ACM_134_471-494","220360163_A_High_Performance_3D_Exact_Euclidean_Distance_Transform_Algorithm_for_Distributed_Computing","220201826_Two_Algorithms_for_Computing_the_Euclidean_Distance_Transform","23707172_Information_Geometry_for_Landmark_Shape_Analysis_Unifying_Shape_Representation_and_Deformation","23456164_Euclidean_Skeletons_of_Digital_Image_and_Volume_Data_in_Linear_Time_by_the_Integer_Medial_Axis_Transform","8331682_The_image_foresting_transform_theory_algorithms_and_applications","6979985_3D_distance_fields_A_survey_of_techniques_and_applications","4046854_Signed_Distance_Transform_Using_Graphics_Hardware","3922714_Fast_multidimensional_parallel_Euclidean_distance_transform_based_on_mathematical_morphology","3873802_Classification_of_the_distance_transformation_algorithms_under_themathematical_morphology_approach","3326046_A_mathematical_morphology_approach_to_Euclidean_distance_transformation","269996292_Distance_Transformations_Fast_Algorithm_and_Applications_to_Medical_Image_Processing","245092718_A_survey_of_a_fundamental_geometric_data_structure","243002033_Euclidean_Distance_Mapping","239515043_Distance_transforms_in_arbitrary_dimensions","239066024_Two_Fast_Euclidean_Distance_Transformations_in_Z2Based_on_Sufficient_Propagation","238228728_Euclidean_distance_transformations_in_Z2_based_on_sufficient_propagation","226439861_A_Sweepline_Algorithm_for_Voronoi_Diagrams","226420426_A_unified_distance_transform_algorithm_and_architecture","223637775_Distance_transforms_for_three-dimensional_grids_with_non-cubic_voxels","223385955_Computing_distance_transformations_in_convex_and_non-convex_domains","223373546_New_Algorithms_for_Euclidean_Distance_Transformation_of_an_n-Dimensional_Digitalized_Picture_with_Applications","223332550_Weighted_digital_distance_transforms_in_four_dimensions","223190849_Voronoi_tessellation_of_points_with_integer_coordinates_Time-efficient_implementation_and_online_edge-list_generation","222978596_Neighborhoods_for_distance_transformations_using_ordered_propagation","222958026_Distance_transforms_Properties_and_machine_vision_applications","222898739_Three-dimensional_Euclidean_distance_transformation_and_its_application_to_shortest_path_planning","222864588_Distance_transforms_in_3D_using_four_different_weights","222858673_The_Euclidean_distance_transform_in_arbitrary_dimensions","222477392_A_Survey_of_Shape_Analysis_Techniques","222394336_Note_Fast_Euclidean_distance_transformation_in_two_scans_using_a_3_3_neighborhood","222234152_Distance_transformation_in_arbitrary_dimensions","220565961_Voronoi_Diagrams_-_A_Survey_of_Fundamental_Geometric_Data_Structure","220459514_Computing_the_N-Dimensional_Delaunay_Tessellation_with_Application_to_Vorono_Polytopes","220182511_An_Efficient_Uniform_Cost_Algorithm_Applied_to_Distance_Transforms","220135382_On_Digital_Distance_Transforms_in_Three_Dimensions","220135157_Fast_Euclidean_Distance_Transformation_by_Propagation_Using_Multiple_Neighborhoods","220114935_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Euclidean_Distance_Maps_of_a_2-D_Binary_Image","220111243_A_Unified_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Computing_Distance_Maps","220055491_A_parallel_implementation_of_exact_Euclidean_distance_transform_based_on_exact_dilations","45660304_Distance-Driven_Skeletonization_in_Voxel_Images","8385002_The_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Achieving_Euclidean_Distance_Transformation","3580468_The_Euclidean_distance_transform_in_arbitrary_dimensions","3507651_Rapid_Euclidean_distance_transform_using_grayscale_morphology_decomposition","3193661_The_Image_Foresting_Transform_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","3192421_Linear_Time_Euclidean_Distance_Transform_Algorithms","3193502_A_linear_time_algorithm_for_computing_exact_Euclidean_distance_transforms_of_binary_images_in_arbitrary_images","3192866_A_List-Processing_Approach_to_Compute_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_the_Euclidean_Distance_Transform","3192261_A_Euclidean_Distance_Transform_Using_Grayscale_Morphology_Decomposition"]}
