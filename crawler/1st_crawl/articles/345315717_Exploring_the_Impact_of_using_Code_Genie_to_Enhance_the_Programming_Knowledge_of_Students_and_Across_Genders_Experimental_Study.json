{"id":"345315717_Exploring_the_Impact_of_using_Code_Genie_to_Enhance_the_Programming_Knowledge_of_Students_and_Across_Genders_Experimental_Study","abstract":"Statistics show that the computer science field is currently\ndominated by White and Asian males. This study aims to explore how to\nincrease students’ interest in programming, especially females and\nunderrepresented minorities, through the use of art and animation elements.\nCode Genie web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was\ndesigned and developed for this study so that a student can write JavaScript\ncode that produces artwork and share with other students through this\nenvironment. In this paper we explore gender differences in understanding\ncomputer programming concepts and whether the use of art has any effect on\nimproving this understanding for both genders. Pretest-posttest experimental\nmethodology was used to collect the data from 65 high school students before\nand after three coding workshops. The results show that the students'\nprogramming knowledge increased in the posttest and their confidence in\nanswering the programming questions increased for both genders as well. The\nresults also show that females’ scores with more coding time were better than\ntheir males' counterparts while males’ scores with less coding time were better\nthan the females of the same group. However, there was not a big difference in\nunderstanding programming concepts between the two genders.\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63128-4_69","authors":["Hadeel Mohammed Jawad"],"meta":["November 2020","Conference: Future Technologies Conference 2020 - https://saiconference.com/FTCAt: Vancouver Canada"],"references":[]}
