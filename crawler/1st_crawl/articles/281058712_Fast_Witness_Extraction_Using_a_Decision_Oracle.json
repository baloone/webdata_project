{"id":"281058712_Fast_Witness_Extraction_Using_a_Decision_Oracle","abstract":"The gist of many (NP-)hard combinatorial problems is to decide whether a\nuniverse of $n$ elements contains a witness consisting of $k$ elements that\nmatch some prescribed pattern. For some of these problems there are known\nadvanced algebra-based FPT algorithms which solve the decision problem but do\nnot return the witness. We investigate techniques for turning such a\nYES/NO-decision oracle into an algorithm for extracting a single witness, with\nan objective to obtain practical scalability for large values of $n$. By\nrelying on techniques from combinatorial group testing, we demonstrate that a\nwitness may be extracted with $O(k\\log n)$ queries to either a deterministic or\na randomized set inclusion oracle with one-sided probability of error.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate through implementation and experiments that the\nalgebra-based FPT algorithms are practical, in particular in the setting of the\n$k$-path problem. Also discussed are engineering issues such as optimizing\nfinite field arithmetic.","authors":["Andreas Bj√∂rklund","Petteri Kaski","Lukasz Kowalik"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44777-2_13","SourcearXiv","Conference: European Symposium on Algorithms"],"references":["281318029_Probably_optimal_graph_motifs","247769530_Finding_the_Minimum-Weight_k-Path","265545385_Randomized_Divide-and-Conquer_Improved_Path_Matching_and_Packing_Algorithms","256720714_Finding_paths_of_length_k_in_O2k_time","256416953_Competitive_Group_Testing","235008671_Combinatorial_Group_Testing_And_Its_Applications","234066578_Abusing_the_Tutte_Matrix_An_Algebraic_Instance_Compression_for_theK-set-cycle_Problem","232958991_Fast_Hamiltonicity_checking_via_bases_of_perfect_matchings","226422812_Constrained_multilinear_detection_for_faster_functional_motif_discovery","223546839_Efficient_implementation_of_the_Galois_Counter_Mode_using_a_carry-less_multiplier_and_a_fast_reduction_algorithm"]}
