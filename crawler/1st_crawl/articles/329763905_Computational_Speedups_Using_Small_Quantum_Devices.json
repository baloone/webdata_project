{"id":"329763905_Computational_Speedups_Using_Small_Quantum_Devices","abstract":"Suppose we have a small quantum computer with only M qubits. Can such a device genuinely speed up certain algorithms, even when the problem size is much larger than M? Here we answer this question to the affirmative. We present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve 3-satisfiability problems involving nâ‰«M variables that significantly speeds up its fully classical counterpart. This question may be relevant in view of the current quest to build small quantum computers.","authors":["Vedran Dunjko","Yimin Ge","J.
