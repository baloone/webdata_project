{"id":"337130764_Introducing_two_complementary_novel_algebraic_operations_Matrix-separation_and_Matrices-joining_for_programming_evaluation_and_development","abstract":"In the last decade, many computer science disciplines have been manipulating large amounts of data like artificial neural networks, data recognition, data mining and big data.\nRecently, many programmers and application designers have relied on the matrices in their algorithms to handle large numbers of data simultaneously to enriching the parallelism for their systems.\nHowever, due to the growth of the data amount in the matrices, there is a need to reshaping these matrices according to the capabilities of the computer systems that are processing these data.\nConsequently, our idea is developing algebraic operations that can represent the reshaping of matrices within the mathematical equations.\nIn this paper, we develop fully two novel compatible algebraic matrices operations to solve this problem. The first operation called “Matrix-Separation” and the second operation denoted by “Matrices-Joining”. These two novel operations assist the programmers and scientists to perform their programs evaluations and developments.","authors":["Assem Badr"],"meta":["November 2019Ain Shams Engineering Journal 11(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.asej.2019.09.009"],"references":["328913308_Modifying_the_logic_gate_symbols_to_enrich_the_designing_of_the_computer_systems_by_3-D_bit-matrices","320820236_Determining_the_Gestation_Age_through_the_automated_measurement_of_the_bi-parietal_distance_in_fetal_ultrasound_images","319965105_Modify_the_mCS-51_with_Vector_Instructions","319963340_Modify_the_mCS-51_Architecture_to_SIMD_VLIW_and_Superscalar_mC","319282300_Evaluation_of_local_scour_around_bridge_piers_for_various_geometrical_shapes_using_mathematical_models","259169401_Design_modified_architecture_for_MCS-51_with_innovated_instructions_based_on_VHDL","323207283_Design_and_Analysis_of_Capacity_Models_for_Lithium-ion_Battery","291118465_High_Performance_Parallelism_Pearls_Multicore_and_Many-core_Programming_Approaches","270310304_The_Foundations_of_Mathematics","35995258_Architecture-independent_loop_parallelisation"]}
