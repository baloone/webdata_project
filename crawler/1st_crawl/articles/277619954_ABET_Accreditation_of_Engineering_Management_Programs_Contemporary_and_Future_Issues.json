{"id":"277619954_ABET_Accreditation_of_Engineering_Management_Programs_Contemporary_and_Future_Issues","abstract":"This article presents the results of a 1999 nationwide survey of engineering management (EM) programs in the U.S. The study was conducted for EMJ in order to determine (1) the causes for an apparent lack of accredited undergraduate and graduate EM programs despite significant growth in the number of EM programs over the last 30 years, and (2) the potential for increased accreditation under the revised accreditation criteria. Data analysis suggests that a much higher value is placed on graduate versus undergraduate education. While most schools thought accreditation was important, accreditation was simply not a goal of most programs. Further, most schools thought the accreditation criteria were too restrictive.","authors":["John V.
