{"id":"312527266_An_observation_on_the_structure_of_production_sets_with_indivisibilities","abstract":"A subset of the constraints of an integer programming problem is said to be binding if, when the remaining constraints are eliminated, the smaller problem has the same optimal solution as the original problem. It is shown that an integer programming problem with n variables has a set of binding constraints of cardinality less than or equal to 2n−1. The bound is sharp.","authors":["Herbert E.
