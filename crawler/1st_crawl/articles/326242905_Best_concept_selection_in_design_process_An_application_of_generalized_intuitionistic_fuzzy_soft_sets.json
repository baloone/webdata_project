{"id":"326242905_Best_concept_selection_in_design_process_An_application_of_generalized_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_sets","abstract":"Concept selection is among the most crucial activities in new product development since the consequences of a bad choice may be disastrous. The recent research of concept selection benefited from soft set theory as an effective tool for that purpose. However, some uncertainties still affix in design concept evaluation, which can be overcome by utilizing membership and non membership functions on design attributes. In this paper, a novel approach of design concept evaluation is introduced based on generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. By combining bijective soft set and intuitionistic fuzzy set, design concepts are specified on design attributes. Generalized b-intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets are used to illustrate the mapping between customer demands and generated design concepts. An algorithm is proposed to select an appropriate object from a set of objects for one or more than one customers. Finally, we present a comparison of our methodology with focal existing methods, and we identify some of their limitations.","authors":["Khizar Hayat","Muhammad Irfan Ali","José Carlos Rodríguez Alcantud","Bing-Yuan Cao"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 35(2):1-14","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-172121","Project: Multi-criteria decision making methods"],"references":["320571956_A_Method_for_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_in_Decision-Making_Based_on_an_Ideal_Solution","320444183_A_New_Type-2_Soft_Set_Type-2_Soft_Graphs_and_Their_Applications","318794561_An_integrated_Shannon_entropy_and_TOPSIS_for_product_design_concept_evaluation_based_on_bijective_soft_set","307934963_Glaucoma_Diagnosis_A_Soft_Set_Based_Decision_Making_Procedure","304104034_A_survey_of_decision_making_methods_based_on_certain_hybrid_soft_set_models","299998877_Representation_of_graphs_based_on_neighborhoods_and_soft_sets","286903464_Operations_on_Soft_Graphs","283558114_Fuzzy_parameterized_fuzzy_soft_sets_and_decision_making","273331383_An_integrated_AHP_and_VIKOR_for_design_concept_evaluation_based_on_rough_number","260371974_Decomposition_of_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_with_Finite_Value_Spaces","257869721_Fuzzy_soft_set_theory_applied_to_medical_diagnosis_using_fuzzy_arithmetic_operations","228149866_Using_the_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_in_New_Product_Screening","222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","220512645_The_bijective_soft_set_with_its_operations","220510798_On_some_new_operations_in_soft_set_theory","220218761_A_new_integrated_design_concept_evaluation_approach_based_on_vague_sets","5158984_Continuous_Utility_Functions_Through_Scales","320549855_An_Adaptive_Soft_Set_Based_Diagnostic_Risk_Prediction_System","317507715_Separable_fuzzy_soft_sets_and_decision_making_with_positive_and_negative_attributes","312073764_A_bijective_soft_set_theoretic_approach_for_concept_selection_in_design_process","305925559_Group_multi-criteria_design_concept_evaluation_using_combined_rough_set_theory_and_fuzzy_set_theory","303056279_Fuzzy_soft_sets","286511846_Product_design_concept_evaluation_using_rough_sets_and_VIKOR_method","281436578_A_novel_algorithm_for_fuzzy_soft_set_based_decision_making_from_multiobserver_input_parameter_data_set","281362528_On_lattice_ordered_soft_sets","265462442_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_sets","260947480_The_preference_effect_in_design_concept_evaluation","257636375_Generalized_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_sets_with_applications_in_decision-making","256992299_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst","226324626_Weak_utilities_from_acyclicity","225780129_Quantifying_uncertainty_in_multicriteria_concept_selection_methods","223125792_Soft_set_theory","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222232374_A_fuzzy_soft_set_theoretic_approach_to_decision_making_problems","220392669_A_soft_set_approach_for_association_rules_mining","220289876_Soft_Set_theory_and_uni-int_decision_making"]}
