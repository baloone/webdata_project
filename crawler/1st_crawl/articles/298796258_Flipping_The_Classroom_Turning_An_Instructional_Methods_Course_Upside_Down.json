{"id":"298796258_Flipping_The_Classroom_Turning_An_Instructional_Methods_Course_Upside_Down","abstract":"Higher education and teacher education in particular are entering a time of transformation. With major forces like shifting demographics, new technologies, and the move from an industrial to an information society, teacher educators need not only to prepare teachers for new ways of teaching, but also must adopt and model best practices for these new teaching methods. This study examines how several key strategies from Flipped Classroom theory can be adapted to an instructional methods course. Findings show that with careful curriculum design, both content and methods learning objectives can be taught and mastered with Flipped Classroom methods.","authors":["Diane B.
