{"id":"317352866_Generalizing_Skew_Jensen_Divergences_and_Bregman_Divergences_With_Comparative_Convexity","abstract":"Comparative convexity is a generalization of ordinary convexity based on abstract means instead of arithmetic means. We introduce the generalized skew Jensen divergences and their corresponding Bregman divergences with respect to comparative convexity. To illustrate those novel families of divergences, we consider the convexity induced by quasi-arithmetic means, and report explicit formula for the corresponding Bregman divergences. In particular, we show that those new Bregman divergences are equivalent to conformal ordinary Bregman divergences on monotone embeddings, and further state related results.","authors":["Frank Nielsen","Richard Nock"],"meta":["June 2017Signal Processing Letters, IEEE PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LSP.2017.2712195"],"references":["308826806_Total_Jensen_divergences_Definition_properties_and_clustering","276035196_Nonparametric_Information_Geometry_From_Divergence_Function_to_Referential-Representational_Biduality_on_Statistical_Manifolds","258699494_On_Conformal_Divergences_and_Their_Population_Minimizers","309574972_A_practical_guide_to_averaging_functions","306037519_Applied_Mathematical_Sciences","288945826_Divergence_measures_based_on_the_Shannon_entropy","284669211_Uber_eine_Klasse_der_Mittelwerte","271736735_Convexity_with_respect_to_families_of_means","270365051_Means_and_Inequalities","268893230_Convex_Functions_and_Their_Applications_A_Contemporary_Approach"]}
