{"id":"253241277_Rainbow_Connections_of_Graphs_A_Survey","abstract":"The concept of rainbow connection was introduced by Chartrand et al. in 2008.\nIt is fairly interesting and recently quite a lot papers have been published\nabout it. In this survey we attempt to bring together most of the results and\npapers that dealt with it. We begin with an introduction, and then try to\norganize the work into five categories, including (strong) rainbow connection\nnumber, rainbow $k$-connectivity, $k$-rainbow index, rainbow vertex-connection\nnumber, algorithms and computational complexity. This survey also contains some\nconjectures, open problems or questions.","authors":["Xueliang Li","Yongtang Shi","Yuefang Sun"],"meta":["January 2013Graphs and Combinatorics 29(1):1--38","DOI:10.1007/s00373-012-1243-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["288383077_Rainbow_Connection_Number_and_Connectivity","273920624_Rainbow_connection_numbers_and_the_minimum_degree_sum_of_a_graph","268518108_On_forbidden_subgraphs_and_rainbow_connection_in_graphs_with_minimum_degree_2","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","289012290_Characterization_of_graphs_with_rainbow_connection_number_m_-_2_and_m_-_3","285312172_On_rainbow_connection_Electron","283869055_Every_monotone_graph_property_has_a_sharp_threshold","281287398_Rainbow_Connections_of_Graphs","268496917_Rainbow_connection_in_graphs","267677133_A_solution_to_a_conjecture_on_two_rainbow_connection_numbers_of_a_graph"]}
