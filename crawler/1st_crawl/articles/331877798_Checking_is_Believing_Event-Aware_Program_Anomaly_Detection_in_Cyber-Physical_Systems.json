{"id":"331877798_Checking_is_Believing_Event-Aware_Program_Anomaly_Detection_in_Cyber-Physical_Systems","abstract":"Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) against malicious attacks is of paramount importance because these attacks may cause irreparable damages to physical systems. Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose \nOrpheus \n, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of \nOrpheus \n, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (\ne \nFSA). \ne \nFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototypeâ€™s performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that \ne \nFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s\n$\\sim$ \n0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.","authors":["Long Cheng","Ke Tian","Danfeng Daphne Yao","Lui Sha"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TDSC.2019.2906161"],"references":["325849038_Enforcing_Full-Stack_Memory-Safety_in_Cyber-Physical_Systems","325776075_Design_and_Analysis_of_Secure_and_Dependable_Automotive_CPS_A_Steer-by-Wire_Case_Study","317230655_HardScope_Thwarting_DOP_with_Hardware-assisted_Run-time_Scope_Enforcement","316913369_ContexIoT_Towards_Providing_Contextual_Integrity_to_Appified_IoT_Platforms","316913173_Hey_My_Malware_Knows_Physics_Attacking_PLCs_with_Physical_Model_Aware_Rootkit","316275234_Multi-level_Anomaly_Detection_in_Industrial_Control_Systems_via_Package_Signatures_and_LSTM_Networks","309451531_Drammer_Deterministic_Rowhammer_Attacks_on_Mobile_Platforms","309128382_PCFIRE_towards_provable_p_reventative_c_ontrol-_f_low_i_ntegrity_enforcement_for_r_ealistic_e_mbedded_software","300358117_SRID_State_Relation_Based_Intrusion_Detection_for_False_Data_Injection_Attacks_in_SCADA","296467457_Exploring_Security_Vulnerabilities_of_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","287866114_Optimal_False_Data_Injection_Attack_against_Automatic_Generation_Control_in_Power_Grids","282978287_Analysis_of_Control_Flow_Events_for_Timing-based_Runtime_Anomaly_Detection","269298940_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Attestation","234790883_Non-control-data_attacks_are_realistic_threats","325480766_NoisePrint_Attack_Detection_Using_Sensor_and_Process_Noise_Fingerprint_in_Cyber_Physical_Systems","323141948_OEI_Operation_Execution_Integrity_for_Embedded_Devices","321543529_Ninja_Towards_Transparent_Tracing_and_Debugging_on_ARM","319946853_Long-Span_Program_Behavior_Modeling_and_Attack_Detection","317922666_Protecting_Bare-Metal_Embedded_Systems_with_Privilege_Overlays","316904631_Towards_Automated_Dynamic_Analysis_for_Linux-based_Embedded_Firmware","316174897_Learning_Execution_Contexts_from_System_Call_Distribution_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Smart_Embedded_System","314796631_Mimicry_attacks_on_host-based_intrusion_detection_systems","314273143_Hardware-assisted_software_event_tracing","310823835_Limiting_the_Impact_of_Stealthy_Attacks_on_Industrial_Control_Systems","310821190_C-FLAT_Control-Flow_Attestation_for_Embedded_Systems_Software","310403686_Control-flow_bending_On_the_effectiveness_of_control-flow_integrity","308871575_Probabilistic_Program_Modeling_for_High-Precision_Anomaly_Classification","306301970_Data-Oriented_Programming_On_the_Expressiveness_of_Non-control_Data_Attacks","306092607_Argus_An_Orthogonal_Defense_Framework_to_Protect_Public_Infrastructure_against_Cyber-Physical_Attacks","301881454_Code_injection_attacks_on_harvard-architecture_devices","301415360_Unearthing_Stealthy_Program_Attacks_Buried_in_Extremely_Long_Execution_Paths","300707977_CPS_approach_to_checking_norm_operation_of_a_brake-by-wire_system","300142085_A_Formal_Framework_for_Program_Anomaly_Detection","299466964_Through_the_eye_of_the_PLC","283762920_MAVR_Code_Reuse_Stealthy_Attacks_and_Mitigation_on_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","271723104_Emerging_Techniques_for_Field_Device_Security","271715505_Behavior_Rule_Specification-Based_Intrusion_Detection_for_Safety_Critical_Medical_Cyber_Physical_Systems","270697209_Modeling_and_Analytics_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems_in_the_Age_of_Big_Data","269196976_A_Trusted_Safety_Verifier_for_Process_Controller_Code","266655704_Practical_trigger-action_programming_in_the_smart_home","266654853_CPS_Stateful_policy_enforcement_for_control_system_device_usage","262402153_A_Survey_of_Intrusion_Detection_Techniques_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","262282828_S3A_secure_system_simplex_architecture_for_enhanced_security_and_robustness_of_cyber-physical_systems","261601275_Adaptive_Intrusion_Detection_of_Malicious_Unmanned_Air_Vehicles_Using_Behavior_Rule_Specifications","261393413_SecureCore_A_multicore-based_intrusion_detection_architecture_for_real-time_embedded_systems","261037759_On-chip_control_flow_integrity_check_for_real_time_embedded_systems","260689975_The_real_story_of_stuxnet","259969999_Cyber-Physical_System_Design_Contracts","234805261_Time-based_intrusion_detection_in_cyber-physical_systems","228759577_Defending_embedded_systems_against_control_flow_attacks","224079248_Sensor_Fusion-based_Event_Detection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221260569_Security_and_Privacy_Vulnerabilities_of_In-Car_Wireless_Networks_A_Tire_Pressure_Monitoring_System_Case_Study","221609687_Attacks_against_process_control_systems_Risk_assessment_detection_and_response","221609557_Control-flow_integrity","221608912_False_Data_Injection_Attacks_Against_State_Estimation_in_Electric_Power_Grids"]}
