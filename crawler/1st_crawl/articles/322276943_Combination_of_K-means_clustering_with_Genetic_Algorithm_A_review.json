{"id":"322276943_Combination_of_K-means_clustering_with_Genetic_Algorithm_A_review","abstract":"In the past few decades, a detailed and extensive research has been carried out on K-Means combine with genetic algorithm for clustering of using this combine technique; to focuses on studying the efficiency and effectiveness of most article. The basic aim of this article is to gather a complete and detailed summary and a clear well explained idea of various methods and algorithms. The calculation of the number of clusters in a data user was done automatically. Representation of operator in GA was developed and group based crossover was done to fix the number of clusters. The problem on the large scale was segregated in to various mini problems through the researchers. To solving small-scale combinatorial optimization. Improving the assembling quality with less time complexity and minimization of the total distance that is travelled by the salesman are also discussed. Overall, almost K-means algorithm with GA have high performance quality of clustering with minimum time and evolution process converge fast compared with anthers technique do not combined GA with k-means cluster.","authors":["Diyar Zeebaree","Habibollah Haron","Adnan Mohsin Abdulazeez","Subhi R.
