{"id":"320112138_A_review_on_application_of_1D_2D_and_3D_bin_packing_Techniquies","abstract":"Bin packing quandary can be defined as locating an arrangement for n objects and each with some weight, into a least number of more sizable capacious holding objects [or bins], such that the total weight of the products in the bin does not surprass the capacity of the bin. The bin-packing quandary arises in forms of one, two and three dimensions. Though a plethora of research has gone into 1D and 2D, 3D bin packing is less researched. The bin packing quandary is NP-hard and is asserted on the partition quandary. It is a conundrum where many no of different heuristic solutions have been the goal is to pack an accumulation of objects into the least number of bins. In this reviews mathematical models, survey lower bounds, classical approximation logarithms, recent heuristic and meta heuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches are discussed.
