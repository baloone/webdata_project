{"id":"237067978_Independent_Component_Analysis","abstract":"A comprehensive introduction to ICA for students and practitionersIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most exciting new topics in fields such as neural networks, advanced statistics, and signal processing. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive introduction to this new technique complete with the fundamental mathematical background needed to understand and utilize it. It offers a general overview of the basics of ICA, important solutions and algorithms, and in-depth coverage of new applications in image processing, telecommunications, audio signal processing, and more.Independent Component Analysis is divided into four sections that cover:* General mathematical concepts utilized in the book* The basic ICA model and its solution* Various extensions of the basic ICA model* Real-world applications for ICA modelsAuthors Hyvarinen, Karhunen, and Oja are well known for their contributions to the development of ICA and here cover all the relevant theory, new algorithms, and applications in various fields. Researchers, students, and practitioners from a variety of disciplines will find this accessible volume both helpful and informative.","authors":["Aapo Hyv√§rinen","Juha Karhunen","Erkki Oja"],"meta":["June 2001","DOI:10.1002/0471221317","Publisher: John Wiley & SonsISBN: 9780471405405"],"references":["220499855_Learning_Overcomplete_Representations","3317707_Temporal_BYY_learning_for_state_space_approach_hidden_Markovmodel_and_blind_source_separation","3035168_Independent_component_analysis_of_noninvasively_recorded_cortical_magnetic_DC-fields_in_humans","257312141_A_Unifying_Information-Theoric_Framework_for_Independent_Component_Analysis","3342566_Blind_separation_of_Gaussian_sources_via_second-order_statistics_with_asymptotically_optimal_weighting","3302754_A_class_of_learning_algorithms_for_principal_component_analysis_and_minor_component_analysis"]}
