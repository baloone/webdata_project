{"id":"303406769_Temporal_patterns_of_scientific_information-seeking_on_Google_and_Wikipedia","abstract":"In response to the news coverage of scientific events and to science education, people increasingly go online to get more information. This study investigates how patterns of science and technology information-seeking on Google and Wikipedia change over time, in ways that differ between “ad hoc” terms that correspond to news coverage and “cyclic” terms that correspond to the academic period. Findings show that the science and technology activity in Google and Wikipedia was significantly associated with ad hoc and cyclic patterns. While the peak activity in Google and Wikipedia largely overlapped for ad hoc terms, it mismatched for cyclic terms. The findings indicate the importance of external cues such as news media and education, and also of the online engagement process, and particularly the crucial but different role played by Google and Wikipedia in gaining science and technology knowledge. Educators and policy makers could benefit from taking into account those different patterns.","authors":["Elad Segev","Aviv Sharon"],"meta":["May 2016Public Understanding of Science 26(8)","DOI:10.1177/0963662516648565","Project: Seeking science information online"],"references":["286849637_Wikis_and_Wikipedia_as_a_teaching_tool_Five_years_later","278030058_Contropedia_-_the_analysis_and_visualization_of_controversies_in_Wikipedia_articles","278029979_Contropedia_-_the_analysis_and_visualization_of_controversies_in_Wikipedia_articles","276382861_How_and_why_young_adults_do_and_do_not_search_for_health_information_Cognitive_and_affective_factors","268233666_Global_Disease_Monitoring_and_Forecasting_with_Wikipedia","262454681_Public_Interest_in_Climate_Change_Over_the_Past_Decade_and_the_Effects_of_the_'Climategate'_Media_Event","261757628_Wikipedia_Usage_Estimates_Prevalence_of_Influenza-Like_Illness_in_the_United_States_in_Near_Real-Time","258173728_The_politics_of_'platforms'","249689493_Wisdom_of_the_Crowd_or_Technicity_of_Content_Wikipedia_as_a_Sociotechnical_System","247157267_Seeking_science_information_online_Data_mining_Google_to_better_understand_the_roles_of_the_media_and_the_education_system","247156546_Taking_Stock_a_Meta-Analysis_of_Studies_on_the_Medias_Coverage_in_Science","245029629_The_half-life_of_a_teachable_moment_The_case_of_Nobel_laureates","240718770_Exploring_New_Web-Based_Tools_to_Identify_Public_Interest_in_Science","233307586_Internet-based_Science_Learning_A_review_of_journal_publications","233071684_From_Scuba_Diving_to_Jet_Skiing_Information_Behavior_Political_Science_and_the_Google_Generation","224818456_Knowledge_Reservations_or_Promise_A_Media_Effects_Model_for_Public_Perceptions_of_Science_and_Technology","224818360_Online_news_and_the_demise_of_political_debate","222824696_Determining_the_Informational_Navigational_and_Transactional_Intent_of_Web_Queries","220168180_How_Today's_College_Students_use_Wikipedia_for_Course-related_Research","209410047_The_Agenda-Setting_Function_of_Mass_Media","49694734_The_changing_information_environment_for_nanotechnology_Online_audiences_and_content","23484549_Detecting_Influenza_Epidemics_Using_Search_Engine_Query_Data","5552414_Cancer_News_Coverage_and_Information_Seeking","277790922_Teachers'_Use_of_Educational_Technology_in_US_Public_Schools_2009_First_Look_NCES_2010-040","263567222_The_Politics_of_Real-time_A_Device_Perspective_on_Social_Media_Platforms_and_Search_Engines","261948433_The_State_of_Public_Opinion_Research_on_Attitudes_and_Understanding_of_Science_and_Technology","259552301_Channeling_Science_Information_Seekers'_Attention_A_Content_Analysis_of_Top-Ranked_vs_Lower-Ranked_Sites_in_Google","259432137_Where_and_When_Can_We_Use_Google_Insights_to_Measure_Issue_Salience","235620592_When_Google_Got_Flu_Wrong","225540919_Mathematics_and_science_teachers'_pedagogical_orientations_and_their_use_of_ICT_in_teaching","224818327_Narrowing_the_nano_discourse","222000217_Seeking_Health_Information_Online_Does_Wikipedia_Matter","220140369_Measurement_and_evidence_of_computer-based_task_switching_and_multitasking_by_'Net_Generation'_students","31492511_Current_Critical_Problems_in_Agenda-Setting_Research"]}
