{"id":"315096375_On_packing_chromatic_number_of_subcubic_outerplanar_graphs","abstract":"The question of whether subcubic graphs have finite packing chromatic number or not is still open although positive responses are known for some subclasses, including subcubic trees, base-3 Sierpiski graphs and hexagonal lattices. In this paper, we answer positively to the question for some subcubic outerplanar graphs. We provide asymptotic bounds depending on structural properties of the weak dual of the outerplanar graphs and determine sharper bounds on some classes of subcubic outerplanar graphs.","authors":["Nicolas Gastineau","PÅ™emysl Holub","Olivier Togni"],"meta":["March 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 255","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2018.07.034"],"references":["315695937_Packing_chromatic_number_of_subcubic_graphs","284136096_Packing_Chromatic_Number_of_Base-3_Sierpinski_Graphs","279897591_On_the_packing_chromatic_number_of_square_and_hexagonal_lattice","261217822_S-Packing_Colorings_of_Cubic_Graphs","257907680_A_lower_bound_for_the_packing_chromatic_number_of_the_Cartesian_product_of_cycles","316200602_The_packing_chromatic_number_of_the_infinite_square_lattice_is_between_13_and_15","306357572_Packing_chromatic_number_under_local_changes_in_a_graph","235359096_The_Packing_Coloring_of_Distance_Graphs_Dkt","222814810_On_the_packing_chromatic_number_of_Cartesian_products_hexagonal_lattice_and_trees","220752560_Complexity_of_the_Packing_Coloring_Problem_for_Trees"]}
