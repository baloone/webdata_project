{"id":"321375286_Refined_Probability_of_Differential_Characteristics_Including_Dependency_Between_Multiple_Rounds","abstract":"The current paper studies the probability of differential characteristics for an unkeyed (or with a fixed key) construction. Most notably, it focuses on the gap between two probabilities of differential characteristics: probability with independent S-box assumption, pind, and exact probability, pexact. It turns out that pexact is larger than pind in Feistel network with some S-box based inner function. The mechanism of this gap is then theoretically analyzed. The gap is derived from interaction of S-boxes in three rounds, and the gap depends on the size and choice of the S-box. In particular the gap can never be zero when the S-box is bigger than six bits. To demonstrate the power of this improvement, a related-key differential characteristic is proposed against a lightweight block cipher RoadRunneR. For the 128-bit key version, pind of 2−48 is improved to pexact of 2−43. For the 80-bit key version, pind of 2−68 is improved to pexact of 2−62. The analysis is further extended to SPN with an almost-MDS binary matrix in the core primitive of the authenticated encryption scheme Minalpher: pind of 2−128 is improved to pexact of 2−96, which allows to extend the attack by two rounds.","authors":["Anne Canteaut","Eran Lambooij","Samuel Neves","Shahram Rasoolzadeh"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.13154/tosc.v2017.i2.203-227"],"references":["282755840_Construction_of_Lightweight_S-Boxes_using_Feistel_and_MISTY_structures","225159884_Markov_Ciphers_and_Differential_Cryptanalysis","300138708_Midori_A_Block_Cipher_for_Low_Energy","283842473_Improved_Top-Down_Techniques_in_Differential_Cryptanalysis","278769170_On_the_Behaviors_of_Affine_Equivalent_Sboxes_Regarding_Differential_and_Linear_Attacks","264915750_Bounds_in_Shallows_and_in_Miseries","243659151_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Data_Encryption_Standard_Springer-Verlag","226173374_Shamir_A_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems_Journal_of_Cryptology_41_3-72","225177225_A_construction_of_a_cipher_from_a_single_pseudorandom_permutation","220942608_New_Structure_of_Block_Ciphers_with_Provable_Security_against_Differential_and_Linear_Cryptanalysis"]}
