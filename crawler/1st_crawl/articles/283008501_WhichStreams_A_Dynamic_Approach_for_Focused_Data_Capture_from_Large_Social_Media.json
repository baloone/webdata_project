{"id":"283008501_WhichStreams_A_Dynamic_Approach_for_Focused_Data_Capture_from_Large_Social_Media","abstract":"Due to the huge amount of data produced on large social media, capturing useful content usually implies to focus on subsets of data that fit with a pre-specified need. Considering the usual API restrictions of these media, we formulate this task of focused capture as a dynamic data sources selection problem. We then propose a machine learning methodology, named WhichStreams, which is based on an extension of a recently proposed combinatorial bandit algorithm. The evaluation of our approach on various Twitter datasets, with both offline and online settings, demonstrates the relevance of the proposal for leveraging the real-time data streaming APIs offered by most of the main social media.","authors":["Thibault Gisselbrecht","Ludovic Denoyer","Patrick Gallinari","Sylvain Lamprier"],"meta":["May 2015","Conference: the Ninth International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM'15)"],"references":["260433655_Choosing_which_message_to_publish_on_social_networks_A_Contextual_bandit_approach","247927896_Emerging_Topic_Detection_on_Twitter_based_on_Temporal_and_Social_Terms_Evaluation","241624330_TwitterEcho_-_A_distributed_focused_crawler_to_support_open_research_with_twitter_data","222486802_Focused_crawling_A_new_approach_to_topic-specific_Web_resource_discovery","290197497_A_fast_bandit_algorithm_for_recommendations_to_users_with_heterogeneous_tastes","286362933_Combinatorial_multi-armed_bandit_General_framework_results_and_applications","266656984_Stochastic_bandits_with_side_observations_on_networks","262174263_Towards_social_data_platform_Automatic_topic-focused_monitor_for_twitter_stream","261201097_Bandit_Algorithms_for_Social_Network_Queries","224836765_Regret_Analysis_of_Stochastic_and_Nonstochastic_Multi-armed_BanditProblems"]}
