{"id":"320408333_Ranking_Fuzzy_Numbers_by_Centroid_Method","abstract":"Ranking fuzzy numbers are one of the important tools in decision process. There are many methods that have been proposed by a number of researchers but most of the methods are nondiscriminating and counterintuitive. Thus, proposing a new method for ranking fuzzy numbers are very prominent. The main objective of this paper is to get better ranking results to rank generalized fuzzy numbers than existing method. This paper reviews the centroid method in ranking fuzzy numbers by several researchers. A new calculation of centroid method will be proposed in this paper. At the end of the paper, a numerical calculation and a comparison of centroid method between the proposed method and other researchersâ€™ method will be showed to check on its consistency.","authors":["Fateen Najwa Azman","Lazim Abdullah"],"meta":["July 2014Malaysian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences 8(3)","DOI:10.11113/mjfas.v8n3.134"],"references":["243781524_A_procedure_for_ranking_fuzzy_numbers_using_fuzzy_relations","289111708_A_Fuzzy_Ranking_Method_for_Fuzzy_Numbers","265438110_Operations_on_fuzzy_numbers_with_function_principle","243775459_Fuzzy_Decision_Making_Including_unequal_objectives","243769921_Introduction_to_Fuzzy_Arithmetic_Theory_and_Applications","242799330_Criteria_for_evaluating_fuzzy_ranking_methods","239494269_Decisionmaking_in_the_Presence_of_Fuzzy_Variables","234819798_Fuzzy_Multiple_Attribute_Decision_Making_Methods_and_Applications","233527861_Ranking_fuzzy_numbers_with_an_area_between_the_centroid_point_and_orginal_point","224653549_Ranking_Indices_and_Rules_for_Fuzzy_Numbers_based_on_Gravity_Center_Point"]}
