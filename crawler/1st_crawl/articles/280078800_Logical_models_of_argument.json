{"id":"280078800_Logical_models_of_argument","abstract":"Logical models of argument formalize commonsense reasoning while taking process and computation seriously. This survey discusses the main ideas that characterize different logical models of argument. It presents the formal features of a few main approaches to the modeling of argumentation. We trace the evolution of argumentation from the mid-1980s, when argument systems emerged as an alternative to nonmonotonic formalisms based on classical logic, to the present, as argument is embedded in different complex systems for real-world applications, and allows more formal work to be done in different areas, such as AI and Law, case-based reasoning and negotiation among intelligent agents.","authors":["Carlos Ches√±evar","Ana Gabriela Maguitman","Ronald Loui"],"meta":["January 2000ACM Computing Surveys 32(4):337-383"],"references":["221539196_Evaluating_a_Learning_Environment_for_Case-Based_Argumentation_Skills"]}
