{"id":"281576301_Ranking_nodes_in_growing_networks_When_PageRank_fails","abstract":"PageRank is arguably the most popular ranking algorithm which is being\napplied in real systems ranging from information to biological and\ninfrastructure networks. Despite its outstanding popularity and broad use in\ndifferent areas of science, the relation between the algorithm's efficacy and\nproperties of the network on which it acts has not yet been fully understood.\nWe study here PageRank's performance on a network model supported by real data,\nand show that realistic temporal effects make PageRank fail in individuating\nthe most valuable nodes for a broad range of model parameters. Results on real\ndata are in qualitative agreement with our model-based findings. This failure\nof PageRank reveals that the static approach to information filtering is\ninappropriate for a broad class of growing systems, and suggest that\ntime-dependent algorithms that are based on the temporal linking patterns of\nthese systems are needed to better rank the nodes.","authors":["Manuel Sebastian Mariani","Matus Medo","Yi-Cheng Zhang"],"meta":["September 2015Scientific Reports 5(1)","DOI:10.1038/srep16181","SourcearXiv","Project: Ranking of nodes in growing information systems"],"references":["281576492_Identification_and_modeling_of_discoverers_in_online_social_systems","275359239_Ranking_in_interconnected_multilayer_networks_reveals_versatile_nodes","272162673_Ranking_species_in_mutualistic_networks","261732144_Statistical_validation_of_high-dimensional_models_of_growing_networks","260352810_Finding_Scientific_Gems_with_Google","258345688_Statistical_validation_of_high-dimensional_models_of_growing_networks","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","279545353_The_Bootstrap"]}
