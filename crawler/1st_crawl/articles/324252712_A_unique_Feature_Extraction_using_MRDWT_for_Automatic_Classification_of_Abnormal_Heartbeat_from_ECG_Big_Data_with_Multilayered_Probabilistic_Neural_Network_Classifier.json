In this paper, five types ECG arrhythmias including normal beats have been classified. The MIT-BIH database of 48 patient records is utilized for detection and analysis of cardiac arrhythmias. Proposed feature extraction utilizes Daubechies as wavelet function and extracts 21 feature points which include the QRS complex of ECG signal. The Multilayered Probabilistic Neural Network (MPNN) classifier is proposed as the best-suited classifier for the proposed feature. Total 1700 ECG betas were tested using MPNN classifier and compared with other three classifiers Back Propagation (BPNN), Multilayered Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system efficiency and performance have been evaluated using seven types of evaluation criteria: precision (PR), F-Score, positive predictivity (PP), sensitivity (SE), classification error rate (CER) and specificity (SP). The overall system accuracy, using MPNN technique utilizing the proposed feature, obtained is 99.53% whereas using BPNN, MLP and SVM provide 97.94%, 98.53%, and 99%. The processing time using MPNN classifier is only 3 s which show that the proposed techniques not only very accurate and efficient but also very quick.","authors":["HARI MOHAN RAI","Kalyan Chatterjee"],"meta":["April 2018Applied Soft Computing 72","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2018.04.005"],"references":["315417629_New_Hybrid_Features_Selection_Method_A_Case_Study_on_Websites_Phishing","312519997_Competitive_probabilistic_neural_network","303870854_A_New_Technique_for_QRS_Complex_Detection_using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_PSO","276497577_Electrocardiogram_Feature_Extraction_and_Pattern_Recognition_Using_a_Novel_Windowing_Algorithm","272014277_R-Peak_Detection_using_Daubechies_Wavelet_and_ECG_Signal_Classification_using_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network","237144291_Improved_QRS_Detection_Algorithm_using_Dynamic_Thresholds","236839260_ECG_arrhythmia_classification_using_daubechies_wavelet_and_radial_basis_function_neural_network","220564764_QRS_complex_detection_based_on_multi_wavelet_packet_decomposition","317439523_Feature_extraction_of_electrocardiogram_signals_by_applying_adaptive_threshold_and_principal_component_analysis","316667118_Promoting_cardiovascular_health_in_the_developing_world_A_critical_challenge_to_achieve_global_health","315437206_A_Lightweight_QRS_Detector_for_Single_Lead_ECG_Signals_using_a_Max-Min_Difference_Algorithm","312204763_ECG_Signal_Analysis_Using_DCT-Based_DOST_and_PSO_Optimized_SVM","306204663_PhysioBank_PhysioToolkit_and_PhysioNet_Components_of_a_new_research_resource_for_complex_physiologic_signals","301599486_A_New_Feature_Selection_Technique_for_Load_and_Price_Forecast_of_Electrical_Power_Systems","280302204_Evolving_Type-2_Fuzzy_Classifier","275214894_An_Incremental_Meta-Cognitive-based_Scaffolding_Fuzzy_Neural_Network","265878683_An_Introduction_to_Probabilistic_Neural_Networks","260313608_pClass_An_Effective_Classifier_for_Streaming_Examples","259810163_ECG_signal_processing_for_abnormalities_detection_using_multi-resolution_wavelet_trans-_form_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_Classifier","249318820_ECG_beat_classifcation_using_a_cost_sensitive_classifier","235440269_A_heart_disease_recognition_embedded_system_with_fuzzy_cluster_algorithm","222718648_Detection_of_ECG_characteristic_points_using_Multiresolution_Wavelet_Analysis_based_Selective_Coefficient_Method","222679069_ECG_beat_classifier_designed_by_combined_neural_network_model","11895647_The_impact_of_the_MIT-BIH_arrhythmia_database","7066211_A_real-time_QRS_detection_metod_based_on_moving-averaging_incorporating_with_wavelet_denoising","3551658_Probabilistic_neural-logic_networks","3477118_Generation_of_Polynomial_Discriminant_Functions_for_Pattern_Recognition","3035450_ECG_Beat_Recognition_Using_Fuzzy_Hybrid_Neural_Network","3035415_A_short-time_multifractal_approach_for_arrhythmia_detection_based_on_fuzzy_neural_network"]}
