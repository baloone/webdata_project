{"id":"335083302_Axiomatic_and_Dual_Systems_for_Constructive_Necessity_a_Formally_Verified_Equivalence","abstract":"We present a proof of the equivalence between two deductive systems for constructive necessity, namely an axiomatic characterisation inspired by Hakli and Negri’s system of derivations from assumptions for modal logic K, a Hilbert-style formalism designed to ensure the validity of the deduction theorem, and the judgmental reconstruction given by Pfenning and Davies by means of a natural deduction approach that makes a distinction between valid and true formulae, constructively. Both systems and the proof of their equivalence are formally verified using the state-of-the-art proof assistant Coq. The proof approach taken throughout the paper unveils the use of some alternative proof methods that allow for a smooth transition from the high-level mathematical proofs to their mechanized counterparts.","authors":["Lourdes del Carmen González Huesca","Favio Ezequiel Miranda-Perea","Pilar selene Linares Arevalo"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics 29(3)","DOI:10.1080/11663081.2019.1647653","Project: Formal verification of Modal Logic"],"references":["327561169_Negative_Translations_and_Normal_Modality","324510659_Fitch-Style_Modal_Lambda_Calculi","280105061_How_to_prove_it_in_Natural_Deduction_A_Tactical_Approach","319054089_Dual-context_calculi_for_modal_logic","300478848_The_Proof_Is_in_the_Process_A_Preamble_for_a_Philosophy_of_Computer-Assisted_Mathematics","283764585_Why_prove_it_again_Alternative_proofs_in_mathematical_practice","274185757_Reviews_Oiva_Ketonen_Untersuchungen_zum_Pradikatenkalkul_Annales_Academiae_Scientiarum_Fennicae_series_A_I_Mathematica-physica_23_Helsinki_1944_71_pp","270301805_Logic_Semantics_Metamathematics_Papers_from_1923_to_1938","268018601_Effective_completeness_theorems_for_modal_logic","267145048_The_deduction_theorems_for_the_modal_propositional_calculi_formalized_after_the_manner_of_Lemmon_I"]}
