{"id":"353642572_Some_Parameterized_Quantum_Midpoint_and_Quantum_Trapezoid_Type_Inequalities_for_Convex_Functions_with_Applications","abstract":"Quantum information theory, an interdisciplinary field that includes computer science, information theory, philosophy, cryptography, and entropy, has various applications for quantum calculus. Inequalities and entropy functions have a strong association with convex functions. In this study, we prove quantum midpoint type inequalities, quantum trapezoidal type inequalities, and the quantum Simpsonâ€™s type inequality for differentiable convex functions using a new parameterized q-integral equality. The newly formed inequalities are also proven to be generalizations of previously existing inequities. Finally, using the newly established inequalities, we present some applications for quadrature formulas.","authors":["Suphawat Asawasamrit","Muhammad Aamir Ali","Sotiris K.
