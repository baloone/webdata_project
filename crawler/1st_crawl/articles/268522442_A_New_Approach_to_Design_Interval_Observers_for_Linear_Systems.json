{"id":"268522442_A_New_Approach_to_Design_Interval_Observers_for_Linear_Systems","abstract":"Interval observers are dynamic systems that provide upper and lower bounds of the true state trajectories of systems. In this work we introduce a technique to design interval observers for linear systems affected by state and measurement disturbances, based on the Internal Positive Representations (IPRs) of systems, that exploits the order preserving property of positive systems. The method can be applied to both continuous and discrete time systems.","authors":["Filippo Cacace","Alfredo Germani","Costanzo Manes"],"meta":["April 2015IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 60(6)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2014.2359714"],"references":["261525402_On_Interval_Observer_Design_for_Time-Invariant_Discrete-Time_Systems","261411895_Stable_Internally_Positive_Representations_of_Continuous_Time_Systems","260661895_On_Interval_Observers_for_Time-Varying_Discrete-Time_Systems","239836649_Internally_Positive_Representation_of_a_Class_of_Continuous_Time_Systems","239416392_Representation_of_a_Class_of_MIMO_Systems_via_Internally_Positive_Realization","285382531_Interconnected_Systems","265446217_Introduction_to_dynamic_systems_Theory_models_and_applications","257388256_Estimation_of_linear_positive_systems_with_unknown_time-varying_delays","256660860_Interval_State_Observer_for_Nonlinear_Time_Varying_Systems","235355960_Stable_Interval_Observers_in_BBC_for_Linear_Systems_With_Time-Varying_Input_Bounds"]}
