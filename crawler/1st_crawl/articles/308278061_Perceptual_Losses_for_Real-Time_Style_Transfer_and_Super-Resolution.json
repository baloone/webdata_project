{"id":"308278061_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution","abstract":"We consider image transformation problems, where an input image is transformed into an output image. Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing perceptual loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.","authors":["Justin Johnson","Alexandre Alahi","Li Fei-Fei"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_43","Conference: European Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["313910272_Synthesising_Dynamic_Textures_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","307560165_Deep_neural_networks_are_easily_fooled_High_confidence_predictions_for_unrecognizable_images","304409176_Conditional_Random_Fields_as_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","301842292_Texture_Networks_Feed-forward_Synthesis_of_Textures_and_Stylized_Images","281312423_A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style","279068412_Understanding_Neural_Networks_Through_Deep_Visualization","278693824_Single-Image_Super-Resolution_A_Benchmark","275523282_Single_Image_Super-resolution_from_Transformed_Self-Exemplars","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","269280482_Deep_Neural_Networks_Are_Easily_Fooled_High_Confidence_Predictions_for_Unrecognizable_Images","268747978_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Fields_for_Depth_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image","266560893_cuDNN_Efficient_Primitives_for_Deep_Learning","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","321616020_Future_Data_and_Security_Engineering_First_International_Conference_FDSE_2014_Ho_Chi_Minh_City_Vietnam_November_19-21_2014_Proceedings","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","319770344_Precomputed_Real-Time_Texture_Synthesis_with_Markovian_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","319770151_Beyond_bits_Reconstructing_images_from_Local_Binary_Descriptors","319770144_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_with_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","319770133_Colorful_Image_Colorization","311610841_Image_Style_Transfer_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311609301_Inverting_Visual_Representations_with_Convolutional_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308852884_Fast_and_accurate_image_upscaling_with_super-resolution_forests","308820111_Deep_convolutional_neural_fields_for_depth_estimation_from_a_single_image","308817986_Full-reference_visual_quality_assessment_for_synthetic_images_A_subjective_study","308805224_Designing_deep_networks_for_surface_normal_estimation","308277343_Colorful_Image_Colorization","308277264_Precomputed_Real-Time_Texture_Synthesis_with_Markovian_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","307822569_Understanding_deep_image_representations_by_inverting_them","304409279_Predicting_Depth_Surface_Normals_and_Semantic_Labels_with_a_Common_Multi-scale_Convolutional_Architecture","303750051_Texture_Synthesis_Using_Shallow_Convolutional_Networks_with_Random_Filters","303505510_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","303432735_Recurrent_convolutional_neural_networks_for_scene_labeling","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","300412635_Deep_Colorization","288640908_A_Adjusted_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Super-Resolution","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284476553_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_with_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","276923091_Learning_Deconvolution_Network_for_Semantic_Segmentation","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","269040983_Understanding_Deep_Image_Representations_by_Inverting_Them","268525233_Designing_Deep_Networks_for_Surface_Normal_Estimation","268524794_Predicting_Depth_Surface_Normals_and_Semantic_Labels_with_a_Common_Multi-Scale_Convolutional_Architecture","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","264890087_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","262974294_Depth_Map_Prediction_from_a_Single_Image_using_a_Multi-Scale_Deep_Network","261378804_Benchmarking_of_quality_metrics_on_ultra-high_definition_video_sequences","262361420_HOGgles_Visualizing_Object_Detection_Features","262049707_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","261479296_Beta_Process_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_with_Application_to_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","261259210_Fast_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_In-Place_Example_Regression"]}
