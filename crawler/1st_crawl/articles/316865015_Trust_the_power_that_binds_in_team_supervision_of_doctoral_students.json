{"id":"316865015_Trust_the_power_that_binds_in_team_supervision_of_doctoral_students","abstract":"Team supervision of doctoral students adds new dimensions and complexities to relationships within the teams that impact functionality of the team. Trust emerged as a significant theme in recent qualitative research into the quality of team supervision of doctoral students. Trust was cited as a key component in successful team collaborations, and the missing component in dysfunctional teams. Definitions refer to trust as the belief of truthfulness, reliability or faith in another personâ€™s abilities. My hypothesis is that trust operates as a form of power in team supervision. It is a form of power that enables voice, resilience and creativity in teams. This article concludes that placing trust in others in supervisory teams is a deliberate decision by candidates and supervisors. It is a decision to engage in a team context despite known risks and may be understood as a gamble on the reliability of others in the expectation of reciprocity. By conceptualising trust as a form of power, strategies that engender and maintain trust may be utilised more intentionally.","authors":["Margaret Robertson"],"meta":["May 2017Higher Education Research and Development 36(1):1-13","DOI:10.1080/07294360.2017.1325853"],"references":["327435208_The_Pedagogy_of_'Good'_PhD_Supervision_A_National_Cross-Disciplinary_Investigation_of_PhD_Supervision","271626119_Beyond_rule_trust_and_power_as_capacities","267096444_Conceptual_Framework_for_Mentoring_Doctoral_Students","263720841_More_than_just_a_brain_Emotions_and_the_doctoral_experience","242020036_Power_and_emotion_in_doctoral_supervision_Implications_for_HRD","232828849_Leadership_and_power_in_Nelson_Mandela's_Long_Walk_to_Freedom","220042022_Models_of_Innovative_Knowledge_Communities_and_Three_Metaphors_of_Learning","346488448_Halliday's_Introduction_to_Functional_Grammar","273958774_Supervision_pedagogies_narratives_from_the_field","259873872_Creative_tensions_negotiating_the_multiple_dimensions_of_a_transdisciplinary_doctorate","248963195_Doctoral_Supervision_of_Colleagues_Peeling_Off_the_Veneer_of_Satisfaction_and_Competence","238671602_The_research_journey_A_Lonely_Planet_approach","235768883_An_Introduction_to_Functional_Grammar","233621179_Research_Training_and_Supervision_Development","233274933_Joint_Supervision_and_the_PhD_safety_net_or_panacea","232890425_Research_supervisors'_different_ways_of_experiencing_of_doctoral_students","227754357_Research_Note_Fieldwork_supervision_and_trust","43452167_Early_warning_signs_in_postgraduate_research_education_A_different_approach_to_ensuring_timely_completions"]}
