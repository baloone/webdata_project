{"id":"234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","abstract":"We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector\nrepresentations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these\nrepresentations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are\ncompared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types\nof neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower\ncomputational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word\nvectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these\nvectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring\nsyntactic and semantic word similarities.","authors":["Tomas Mikolov","Kai Chen","G.s.
