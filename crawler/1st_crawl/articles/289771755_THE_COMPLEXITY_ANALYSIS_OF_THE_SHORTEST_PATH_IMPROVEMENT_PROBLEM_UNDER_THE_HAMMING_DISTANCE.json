{"id":"289771755_THE_COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS_OF_THE_SHORTEST_PATH_IMPROVEMENT_PROBLEM_UNDER_THE_HAMMING_DISTANCE","abstract":"In this paper, we prove the inapproximability of the shortest path improvement problems under the sum-type Hamming distance. We first show that achieving an algorithm within a worst-case ratio of O(log vertical bar V vertical bar) is NP-hard, where V is the set of nodes. Then we propose a greedy-type heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the algorithm.","authors":["Zhang Binwu","Xiucui Guan","Qin Wang","Chunyuan He"],"meta":["October 2015Pacific Journal of Optimization 11(4):605-618","Project: inverse max+sum optimization problems"],"references":["226157256_Computation_of_the_Reverse_Shortest-Path_Problem","226798738_A_column_generation_method_for_inverse_shortest_path_problems","225367682_Constrained_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_under_the_Bottleneck-Type_Hamming_Distance","225221814_On_an_Instance_of_the_Inverse_Shortest_Paths_Problem","223926726_Some_inverse_optimization_problems_under_the_Hamming_distance","221591442_A_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_Low-Degree_Test_and_a_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_PCP_Characterization_of_NP","221444086_Inverse_Min-Max_Spanning_Tree_Problem_Under_the_Weighted_Sum-Type_Hamming_Distance","220289486_Inverse_minimum_cost_flow_problems_under_the_weighted_Hamming_distance","220153634_Inverse_Min-Max_Spanning_Tree_Problem_Under_the_Weighted_Sum-Type_Hamming_Distance","220089506_The_Center_Location_Improvement_Problem_Under_the_Hamming_Distance"]}
