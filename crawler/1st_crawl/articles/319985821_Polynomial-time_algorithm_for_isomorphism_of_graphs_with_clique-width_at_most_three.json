{"id":"319985821_Polynomial-time_algorithm_for_isomorphism_of_graphs_with_clique-width_at_most_three","abstract":"The clique-width is a measure of complexity of decomposing graphs into certain tree-like structures. The class of graphs with bounded clique-width contains bounded tree-width graphs. We give a polynomial time graph isomorphism algorithm for graphs with clique-width at most three. Our work is independent of the work by Grohe et al. showing that the isomorphism problem for graphs of bounded clique-width is polynomial time.","authors":["Bireswar Das","Murali Krishna Enduri","Vinod Reddy"],"meta":["September 2017Theoretical Computer Science 819","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.09.013","Project: Graph Isomorphism for Restricted Graph Classes"],"references":["261369015_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Canonization_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Treewidth"]}
