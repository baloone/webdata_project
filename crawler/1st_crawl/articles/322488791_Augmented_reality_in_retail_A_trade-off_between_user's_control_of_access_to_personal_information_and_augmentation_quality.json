{"id":"322488791_Augmented_reality_in_retail_A_trade-off_between_user's_control_of_access_to_personal_information_and_augmentation_quality","abstract":"This study conducted a qualitative experimental study to develop a scale, augmentation quality that measures the output quality of augmented reality. Augmentation quality is a new aspect of user experience being captured through interaction with augmented reality. Since controlling access to their personal information is a significant concern of users, this study also conducted a quantitative experimental study and applied equity theory to examine how augmentation quality and usersâ€™ control of access to their personal information impacts user satisfaction. This study was conducted in three different contexts: online shopping, entertainment services, and basic service maintenance. ANOVA was applied to examine the significant differences in user satisfaction, user's control of access to personal information, and augmentation quality across the three contexts. Results indicated that individuals pay attention to both the privacy of their personal information as well as augmentation quality. The results also indicated that the ability to control access to personal information significantly affects user satisfaction. The results of this study carry important managerial implications for augmented reality developers and retailers.","authors":["Atieh Poushneh"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Retailing and Consumer
