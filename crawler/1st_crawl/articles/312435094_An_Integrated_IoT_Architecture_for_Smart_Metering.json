{"id":"312435094_An_Integrated_IoT_Architecture_for_Smart_Metering","abstract":"Advanced meter infrastructures (AMIs) are systems that measure, collect, and analyze utilities distribution and consumption, and communicate with metering devices either on a schedule or on request. AMIs are becoming a vital part of utilities distribution network and allow the development of Smart Cities. In this article we propose an integrated Internet of Things architecture for smart meter networks to be deployed in smart cities. We discuss the communication protocol, the data format, the data gathering procedure, and the decision system based on big data treatment. The architecture includes electricity, water, and gas smart meters. Real measurements show the benefits of the proposed IoT architecture for both the customers and the utilities.","authors":["Jaime Lloret","Jesús Tomás","Alejandro Canovas","Lorena Parra"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Communications Magazine 54(12):50-57","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2016.1600647CM","Project: IoT, e-santé, Smart cities"],"references":["280921783_ZigBee_Based_Optimal_Scheduling_System_for_Home_Appliances_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates","265487603_Analysis_of_State-of-the-art_Smart_Metering_Communication_Standards","264937761_A_Survey_on_Electric_Power_Demand_Forecasting_Future_Trends_in_Smart_Grids_Microgrids_and_Smart_Buildings","264354621_On_the_Impact_of_Virtual_Private_Network_Technologies_on_the_Operational_Costs_of_Cellular_Machine-to-Machine_Communications_Platforms_for_Smart_Grids","263699831_A_survey_on_Advanced_Metering_Infrastructure","258537992_A_Multi-Agent-System_Architecture_for_Smart_Grid_Management_and_Forecasting_of_Energy_Demand_in_Virtual_Power_Plants","224142125_A_Survey_of_Communication_Protocols_for_Automatic_Meter_Reading_Applications","220520348_Power_Saving_and_Energy_Optimization_Techniques_for_Wireless_Sensor_Neworks_Invited_Paper","282060491_A_Survey_of_Sensor_Network_Applications_and_Architectural_Components","277334549_MLlib_Machine_Learning_in_Apache_Spark"]}
