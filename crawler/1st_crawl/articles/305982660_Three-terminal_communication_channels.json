{"id":"305982660_Three-terminal_communication_channels","abstract":"The problem of transmitting information in a specified direction over a communication channel with three terminals is considered. Examples are given of the various ways of sending information. Basic inequalities for average mutual information rates are obtained. A coding theorem and weak converse are proved and a necessary and sufficient condition for a positive capacity is derived. Upper and lower bounds on the capacity are obtained, which coincide for channels with symmetric structure.","authors":["Edward C.
