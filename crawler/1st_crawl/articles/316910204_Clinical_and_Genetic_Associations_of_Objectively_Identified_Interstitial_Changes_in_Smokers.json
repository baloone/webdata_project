{"id":"316910204_Clinical_and_Genetic_Associations_of_Objectively_Identified_Interstitial_Changes_in_Smokers","abstract":"Background: \nSmoking related lung injury may manifest on computed tomography (CT) as both emphysema and interstitial changes. We have developed an automated method to quantify interstitial changes and hypothesized that this measurement would be associated with lung function, quality of life, mortality, and a MUC5B polymorphism.\n\nMethods: \nUsing CT scans from the COPDGene study, lung parenchyma was objectively labeled as a tissue subtype and the percentage of the lung occupied by interstitial subtypes was calculated.\n\nFindings: \n8345 participants had clinical and CT data available. A 5% absolute increase in interstitial changes was associated with an absolute increase in percent predicted forced vital capacity of 2.47% (p<0.001) and a 1.36 point higher St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (p<0.001). Among the 6827 participants with mortality data, a 5% increase in interstitial changes was associated with a 29% increased risk of death (p<0.001). These associations were present in a subgroup without visually defined interstitial lung abnormalities, as well as in those with normal spirometry, and in those without chronic respiratory symptoms. In non-Hispanic whites, for each copy of the minor allele of the MUC5B promoter polymorphism there was a 0.63% (p=1x10(-7)) absolute increase in the percentage of lung with interstitial changes.\n\nConclusions: \nObjective interstitial changes on CT were associated with impaired lung function, worse quality of life, increased mortality, and more copies of a MUC5B promoter polymorphism, suggesting that these changes may be a marker of susceptibility to smoking related lung injury, detectable even in those who are normal by other measures.","authors":["Samuel Ash","Rola Harmouche","Rachel K.
