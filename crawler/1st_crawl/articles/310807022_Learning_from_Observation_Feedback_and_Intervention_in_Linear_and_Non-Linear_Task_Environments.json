{"id":"310807022_Learning_from_Observation_Feedback_and_Intervention_in_Linear_and_Non-Linear_Task_Environments","abstract":"This multiple-cue judgment study investigates whether we can manipulate the judgment strategy and increase accuracy in linear and nonlinear cue-criterion environments just by changing the training mode. Three experiments show that accuracy in simple linear additive task environments are improved with feedback training and intervention training, while accuracy in complex multiplicative tasks are improved with observational training. The observed interaction effect suggests that the training mode invites different strategies that are adjusted as a function of experience to the demands from the underlying cue-criterion structure. Thus, feedback and the intervention training modes invite cue abstraction, an effortful but successful strategy in combination with simple linear task structures, and observational training invites exemplar memory processes, a simple but successful strategy in combination with complex nonlinear task structures. The study discusses adaptive cognition and the implication of the different training modes across a life span and for clinical populations.","authors":["Maria P Henriksson","Tommy Enkvist"],"meta":["November 2016Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology (2006) 71(2):1-57","DOI:10.1080/17470218.2016.1263998"],"references":["273157023_A_rational_model_of_function_learning","258847992_Direct_Comparison_of_the_Efficacy_of_Intuitive_and_Analytical_Cognition_in_Expert_Judgment","236079716_Is_It_Better_to_Select_or_to_Receive_Learning_via_Active_and_Passive_Hypothesis_Testing","232540710_Cognitive_and_outcome_feedback_in_multiple-cue_probability_learning_tasks","51779950_Adult_Age_Differences_in_Categorization_and_Multiple-Cue_Judgment","46525620_Cue_integration_vs_exemplar-based_reasoning_in_multi-attribute_decisions_from_memory_A_matter_of_cue_representation","44569233_Learning_in_a_Changing_Environment","40869010_Do_Children_Profit_From_Looking_Beyond_Looks_From_Similarity-Based_to_Cue_Abstraction_Processes_in_Multiple-Cue_Judgment","26655648_Models_of_Quantitative_Estimations_Rule-Based_and_Exemplar-Based_Processes_Compared","13661419_Rules_and_Exemplars_in_Category_Learning","13588697_A_Neuropsychological_Theory_of_Multiple_Systems_in_Category_Learning","12773673_Striatal_activation_during_cognitive_skill_learning","344485006_The_Adaptive_Decision_Maker","325672233_Learning_Nonlinearly_Separable_Categories_by_Inference_and_Classification","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","288405958_Classification_and_Cognition","279609185_Chapter_2_Judgment_Analysis_Procedures","259719900_Costs_and_benefits_of_automatization_in_category_learning_of_ill-defined_rules","254408793_Dual-processes_in_learning_and_judgment_Evidence_from_the_multiple_cue_probability_learning_paradigm","248669163_Negative_effects_of_outcome-feedback_in_multiple-cue_probability_learning1","248398994_When_the_Rule_is_Ruled_Out_Exemplars_and_Rules_in_Decisions_from_Memory","247781186_What_Have_Psychologists_And_Others_Discovered_About_the_Process_of_Scientific_Discovery","239073340_Why_does_cue_polarity_information_provide_benefits_in_inference_problems_The_role_of_strategy_selection_and_knowledge_of_cue_importance","233980198_The_Adaptive_Decision_Maker","232556903_Linear_Models_in_Decision_Making","232550937_Toward_an_Instance_Theory_of_Automatization","232524583_Cue_Discovery_in_Probabilistic_Environments_Uncertainty_and_Experimentation","232506475_Bending_the_Power_Law_A_CMPL_Theory_of_Strategy_Shifts_and_the_Automatization_of_Cognitive_Skills","232506114_Context_Theory_of_Classification_Learning","232496143_Chapter_4_On_the_How_and_Why_not_of_Learning_from_Outcomes","232491563_The_Effects_of_Cognitive_Feedback_on_Performance","232474564_Linear_Regression_and_Process-Tracing_Models_of_Judgment","232458876_Judgment_analysis_Theory_methods_and_applications","232428558_Acquisition_and_application_of_knowledge_in_complex_inference_tasks","226655351_Overall_similarity_and_the_identification_of_separable-dimension_stimuli_A_choice_model_analysis","223510789_The_Psychology_of_Linear_Judgment_Models","223409522_Information_integration_and_subjective_weights_in_multiple-cue_judgments","222909808_In_One_Word_Not_from_Experience","222845362_Note_on_subjects'_hypotheses_in_multiple-cue_probability_learning","222654911_Inferring_causal_networks_from_observations","222488719_Categorization_using_chains_of_examples","222284496_The_Effects_of_Cognitive_Feedback_and_Task_Complexity_in_Multiple-Cue_Probability_Learning","220041145_The_Adaptive_Nature_Of_Human_Categorization","49682213_Longitudinal_evidence_for_diminished_frontal_cortex_function_in_aging","23395772_The_Effectiveness_of_Feedback_in_Multiple-Cue_Probability_Learning","20207314_Attention_and_Learning_Processes_in_the_Identification_and_Categorization_of_Integral_Stimuli","19329857_Overall_similarity_and_the_identification_of_separable-dimension_stimuli_A_choice_model_analysis","17531158_Event_observation_in_probability_learning","13989110_Extrapolation_The_Sine_Qua_Non_for_Abstraction_in_Function_Learning","13723720_Alternative_Strategies_of_Categorization","11352314_Learning_Nonlinearly_Separable_Categories_by_Inference_and_Classification","11169332_Observational_versus_feedback_training_in_rule-based_and_information-integration_category_learning","12633784_Thirty_Categorization_Results_in_Search_of_a_Model","12582074_Cross-Validation_Methods","10993023_Are_there_representational_shifts_in_category_learning"]}
