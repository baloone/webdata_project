{"id":"326887520_Chaff_from_the_Wheat_Characterizing_and_Determining_Valid_Bug_Reports","abstract":"Developers use bug reports to triage and fix bugs. When triaging a bug report, developers must decide whether the bug report is valid (i.e., a real bug). A large amount of bug reports are submitted every day, with many of them end up being invalid reports. Manually determining valid bug report is a difficult and tedious task. Thus, an approach that can automatically analyze the validity of a bug report and determine whether a report is valid can help developers prioritize their triaging tasks and avoid wasting time and effort on invalid bug reports.","authors":["Yuanrui Fan","Xin Xia","David Lo","Ahmed E.
