{"id":"319046323_Selecting_Project_Delivery_Systems_Based_on_Simplified_Neutrosophic_Linguistic_Preference_Relations","abstract":"Project delivery system selection is an essential part of project management. In the process of choosing appropriate transaction model, many factors should be under consideration, such as the capability and experience of proprietors, project implementation risk, and so on. How to make their comprehensive evaluations and select the optimal delivery system? This paper proposes a decision-making approach based on an extended linguistic preference structure: simplified neutrosophic linguistic preference relations (SNLPRs). The basic elements in SNLPRs are simplified neutrosophic linguistic numbers (SNLNs). First, several distance measures of SNLNs are introduced. A distance-based consistency index is provided to measure the consistency degree of a simplified neutrosophic linguistic preference relation (SNLPR). When the SNLPR is not acceptably consistent, a consistency-improving automatic iterative algorithm may be used. Afterwards, a decision-making method with SNLPRs is developed. The example of its application in project delivery systems' selection is offered, and a comparison analysis is given in the end as well.","authors":["Sui-Zhi Luo","Peng-Fei Cheng","Jianqiang Wang","Yuan-Ji Huang"],"meta":["August 2017Symmetry 9(8):151","DOI:10.3390/sym9080151"],"references":["318213749_Solving_Solar-Wind_Power_Station_Location_Problem_Using_an_Extended_Weighted_Aggregated_Sum_Product_Assessment_WASPAS_Technique_with_Interval_Neutrosophic_Sets","317776599_Distance-based_nonlinear_programming_models_to_identify_and_adjust_inconsistencies_for_linguistic_preference_relations","317321720_Some_Single-Valued_Neutrosophic_Dombi_Weighted_Aggregation_Operators_for_Multiple_Attribute_Decision-Making","317255953_Multiple_Attribute_Decision-Making_Method_Using_Correlation_Coefficients_of_Normal_Neutrosophic_Sets","349099162_Selecting_Optimal_Project_Delivery_System_for_Infrastructural_Projects_Using_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process","319326289_A_multihesitant_fuzzy_linguistic_multicriteria_decision-making_approach_for_logistics_outsourcing_with_incomplete_weight_information","318438281_2-tuple_linguistic_intuitionistic_preference_relation_and_its_application_in_sustainable_location_planning_voting_system","318353388_Consensus-based_framework_to_MCGDM_under_multi-granular_uncertain_linguistic_environment","318300501_A_shareholder_voting_method_for_proxy_advisory_firm_selection_based_on_2-tuple_linguistic_picture_preference_relation","317526405_An_extended_outranking_approach_for_multi-criteria_decision-making_problems_with_linguistic_intuitionistic_fuzzy_numbers"]}
