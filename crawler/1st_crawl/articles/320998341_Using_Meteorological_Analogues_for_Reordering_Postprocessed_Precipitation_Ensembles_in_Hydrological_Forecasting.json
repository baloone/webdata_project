{"id":"320998341_Using_Meteorological_Analogues_for_Reordering_Postprocessed_Precipitation_Ensembles_in_Hydrological_Forecasting","abstract":"Meteorological ensemble forecasts are nowadays widely used as input of hydrological models for probabilistic streamflow forecasting. These forcings are frequently biased and have to be statistically post-processed, using most of the time univariate techniques that apply independently to individual locations, lead time and weather variables. Post-processed ensemble forecasts therefore need to be reordered so as to reconstruct suitable multivariate dependence structures. The Schaake shuffle and ensemble copula coupling are the two most popular methods for this purpose. This paper proposes two adaptations of them that make use of meteorological analogues for reconstructing spatio-temporal dependence structures of precipitation forecasts. Performances of the original and adapted techniques are compared through a multi-step verification experiment using real forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. This experiment evaluates multivariate precipitation forecasts but also the corresponding streamflow forecasts that derive from hydrological modeling. Results show that the relative performances of the different reordering methods vary depending on the verification step. In particular, the standard Schaake shuffle is found to perform poorly when evaluated on streamflow. This emphasizes the crucial role of the precipitation spatio-temporal dependence structure in hydrological ensemble forecasting.","authors":["Joseph Bellier","Guillaume Bontron","Isabella
