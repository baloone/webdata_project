{"id":"279068552_Systemic_risk_in_multiplex_networks_with_asymmetric_coupling_and_threshold_feedback","abstract":"We study cascades on a two-layer multiplex network, with asymmetric feedback\nthat depends on the coupling strength between the layers. Based on an\nanalytical branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk\nmeasured by the final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The\nresults are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an\naggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the\ntwo-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling\nstrength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength,\nsystemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in\nthe two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size\nthat are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied\nto a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into\na less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,\nthis may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated\nin an aggregated approach.","authors":["Rebekka Burkholz","Matt V.
