{"id":"318642674_Combination_of_Cognitive_and_Quantitative_Aspects_to_Estimate_the_Degree_of_Emotions","abstract":"Emotions play a more and more important role in many fields of computer sciences such\nas ambient intelligence, interaction human - machine, affective computing, etc. This paper firstly\nconstructs a logical framework to represent the qualitative cognitive factor of emotion based on a\nlogic of belief and a logic of time. Secondly, it constructs a hedge algebra and its extension with\nfuzzy logic to represent the quantitative factor of emotions. These two aspects of emotion are then\ncombined to estimate the degree of emotions based on the degree of their cognitive factors.","authors":["Manh Hung Nguyen"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Computer Science and Cybernetics 32(3):209-224","DOI:10.15625/1813-9663/32/3/8322"],"references":["234807189_Automatic_Verification_of_Finite_State_Concurrent_Systems_Using_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","232487951_Appraisal_theory_Overview_assumptions_varieties_controversies","229060013_A_Computational_Model_of_Capability-Based_Emotion_Elicitation_for_Rational_Agent","329648496_Dynamic_Logic","284608960_Cognitive_social_and_physiological_determinants_of_emotional_state","274495253_Morality_and_the_Emotions","261843563_A_logical_framework_for_Trust-Related_emotions_formal_and_behavioral_results","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","240291642_The_cognitive_structure_of_emotions_Cambridge","235361343_Emotion_and_Personality"]}
