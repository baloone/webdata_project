However, disgust seems resistant to exposure with response prevention partly due to the fact that disgust is acquired through evaluative conditioning.\n\nAims: \nThe present research investigates a counter-conditioning intervention in treating disgust-related emotional responses in two groups of individuals with high (High contamination concerns, HCC, n = 24) and low (Low contamination concerns LCC, n = 23) contamination concerns.\n\nMethods: \nThe two groups completed a differential associative learning task in which neutral images were followed by disgusting images (conditioned stimulus; CS+), or not (CS-). Following this acquisition phase, there was a counter-conditioning procedure in which CS+ was followed by a very pleasant unconditional stimulus while CS- remained unreinforced.\n\nResults: \nFollowing counter-conditioning, both groups reported significant reduction in their expectancy of US occurrence and reported less disgust with CS+. For both expectancy and disgust, reduction was lower in the HCC group than in the LCC group. Disgust sensitivity was highly correlated with both acquisition and maintenance of the response acquired, while US expectation was predicted by anxiety.\n\nConclusion: \nCounter-conditioning procedure reduces both expectations and conditioned disgust.","authors":["Caroline Novara","Cindy Lebrun","Alexandra Macgregor","Bruno Vivet"],"meta":["July 2021PLoS ONE 16(7):e0254592","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0254592"],"references":["330728378_Disgust_assessment_Factorial_structure_and_psychometric_properties_of_the_French_version_of_the_Disgust_Propension_and_Sensibility_Scale_Revised-12","264791219_Change_in_disgust_reactions_following_cognitive-behavioral_therapy_for_childhood_anxiety_disorders","325671360_Associative_Learning_of_Likes_and_Dislikes_A_Review_of_25_Years_of_Research_on_Human_Evaluative_Conditioning","315599301_Pavlovian_disgust_conditioning_as_a_model_for_contamination-based_OCD_Evidence_from_an_analogue_study","310787218_The_DIsgust-RelaTed-Images_DIRTI_database_Validation_of_a_novel_standardized_set_of_disgust_pictures","310766029_Fear_reduction_without_fear_through_reinforcement_of_neural_activity_that_bypasses_conscious_exposure","309512538_Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","284868955_Exposure_therapy_has_a_public_relations_problem_A_dearth_of_litigation_amid_a_wealth_of_concern","279737200_Effective_behavioural_strategies_for_reducing_disgust_in_contamination-related_OCD_A_review","274078651_Suicidality_in_Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder_OCD_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","257205633_A_systematic_review_of_predictors_and_moderators_of_response_to_psychological_therapies_in_OCD_Do_we_have_enough_empirical_evidence_to_target_treatment","262643967_Maximizing_Exposure_Therapy_An_Inhibitory_Learning_Approach","261953977_Shaking_That_Icky_Feeling_Effects_of_Extinction_and_Counterconditioning_on_Disgust-Related_Evaluative_Learning","261850467_Treating_Disgust_in_Anxiety_Disorders","255954765_Treatment_Response_Symptom_Remission_and_Wellness_in_Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder"]}
