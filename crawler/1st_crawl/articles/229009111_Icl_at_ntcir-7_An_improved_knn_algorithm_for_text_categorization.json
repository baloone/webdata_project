{"id":"229009111_Icl_at_ntcir-7_An_improved_knn_algorithm_for_text_categorization","abstract":"This paper describes our system for the NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task which sought to make automatic text classification pragmatic. Our system employs an improved KNN algorithm which makes trade-off between effectiveness and time complexity. We have tried two distance metrics in our algorithm: cosine similarity and Euclid distance. Evaluation results on NTCIR-7 test data shows that the former one is slightly better.","authors":["Wei Wang","Sujian Li","Chen Wang"],"meta":[],"references":["237214922_Advances_in_Machine_Learning_Based_Text_Categorization"]}
