{"id":"332777280_A_Mature-Tomato_Detection_Algorithm_Using_Machine_Learning_and_Color_Analysis","abstract":"An algorithm was proposed for automatic tomato detection in regular color images to reduce the influence of illumination and occlusion. In this method, the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor was used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A coarse-to-fine scanning method was developed to detect tomatoes, followed by a proposed False Color Removal (FCR) method to remove the false-positive detections. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) was used to merge the overlapped results. Compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm showed substantial improvement in tomato detection. The results of tomato detection in the test images showed that the recall, precision, and F1 score of the proposed method were 90.00%, 94.41 and 92.15%, respectively.","authors":["Guoxu Liu","Shuyi Mao","Jae Ho Kim"],"meta":["April 2019Sensors 19(9):2023","DOI:10.3390/s19092023","Project: Plant growing"],"references":["303916916_Detecting_tomatoes_in_greenhouse_scenes_by_combining_AdaBoost_classifier_and_colour_analysis","292337307_Robust_Tomato_Recognition_for_Robotic_Harvesting_Using_Feature_Images_Fusion","333151880_A_Robust_Mature_Tomato_Detection_in_Greenhouse_Scenes_Using_Machine_Learning_and_Color_Analysis","332200513_Decoding_Behavior_Tasks_From_Brain_Activity_Using_Deep_Transfer_Learning","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","315119784_Inshore_Ship_Detection_in_Remote_Sensing_Images_via_Weighted_Pose_Voting","312538118_Support-vector_networks","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","305828246_A_review_of_key_techniques_of_vision-based_control_for_harvesting_robot","263817219_On_Plant_Detection_of_Intact_Tomato_Fruits_Using_Image_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning_Methods","262171688_Computer_vision_for_fruit_harvesting_robots-State_of_the_art_and_challenges_ahead","274063825_Computer_Vision_Metrics_Survey_Taxonomy_Analysis","265128708_Automatic_method_of_fruit_object_extraction_under_complex_agricultural_background_for_vision_system_of_fruit_picking_robot","263317129_Recognition_of_clustered_tomatoes_based_on_binocular_stereo_vision"]}
