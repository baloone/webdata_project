{"id":"328955828_Structural_Controllability_of_Symmetric_Networks","abstract":"The theory of structural controllability allows us to assess controllability of a network as a function of its interconnection graph and independently of the edge weights. Yet, existing structural controllability results require the weights to be selected arbitrarily and independently from one another, and provide no guarantees when these conditions are not satisfied. In this note we develop a new theory for structural controllability of networks with symmetric, thus constrained, weights. First, we show that network controllability remains a generic property even when the weights are symmetric. Then, we characterize necessary and sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for structural controllability of networks with symmetric weights: a symmetric network is structurally controllable if and only if it is structurally controllable without weight constraints. Finally, we use our results to assess structural controllability from one region of a class of empirically-reconstructed brain networks.","authors":["Tommaso Menara","Danielle S Bassett","Fabio Pasqualetti"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 64(9)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2018.2881112","Project: Controllability of Brain Networks"],"references":["317087932_Warnings_and_Caveats_in_Brain_Controllability","305870242_Effects_Of_Symmetry_On_The_Structural_Controllability_Of_Neural_Networks_A_Perspective","305779192_Autaptic_Connections_Shift_Network_Excitability_and_Bursting","289587798_Stimulation-Based_Control_of_Dynamic_Brain_Networks","282367377_Controllability_of_structural_brain_networks","265546964_On_generic_properties_of_linear_systems_An_overview","265442378_Linear_Multivariable_Controll_A_Geometric_Approach","259499749_Resting-brain_functional_connectivity_predicted_by_analytic_measures_of_network_communication","257200247_Linear_Multivariable_Control","256926210_A_Framework_for_Structural_InputOutput_and_Control_Configuration_Selection_in_Large-Scale_Systems","256500455_Exact_Controllability_of_complex_networks","248392105_BrainNet_Viewer_A_Network_Visualization_Tool_for_Human_Brain_Connectomics","236935784_Controllability_Transition_and_Nonlocality_in_Network_Control","223466700_Controlling_Complex_Networks_How_Much_Energy_Is_Needed","221667959_Controllability_and_Observability_of_Grid_Graphs_via_Reduction_and_Symmetries","221422197_Steering_a_Leader-Follower_Team_Via_Linear_Consensus","51117462_Controllability_of_complex_networks","51001416_Controllability_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_from_a_Graph-Theoretic_Perspective","5373645_On_How_Network_Architecture_Determines_the_Dominant_Patterns_of_Spontaneous_Neural_Activity","5254952_Mapping_the_Structural_Core_of_Human_Cerebral_Cortex","326008454_The_Structured_Controllability_Radius_of_Symmetric_Brain_Networks","320369005_On_the_Structural_and_Strong_Structural_Controllability_of_Undirected_Networks","318720962_Structural_Controllability_of_Linear_Time-invariant_Systems","313766196_Controllability_of_multi-agent_systems_from_a_graph-theoretic_perspective","305995220_A_Distance-Based_Approach_to_Strong_Target_Control_of_Dynamical_Networks","304410400_State_controllability_output_controllability_and_stabilizability_of_networks_A_symmetry_perspective","297040568_Structural_controllability","279837474_Observer-based_monitors_and_distributed_wave_controllers_for_electromechanical_disturbances_in_power_systems","275967437_Matrix_Analysis_and_Applied_Linear_Algebra","273393804_Control-Theoretic_Methods_for_Cyberphysical_Security_Geometric_Principles_for_Optimal_Cross-Layer_Resilient_Control_Systems","270756127_On_the_Existence_of_Optimal_Controls","265564508_Systems_Analysis_b_y_Graphs_and_Matroids-Structural_Solv_ability_and_Controllability","265538686_Multivariable_Control_A_Graph-Theoretic_Approach","264585580_Controllability_Metrics_Limitations_and_Algorithms_for_Complex_Networks","262340868_Synchronization_in_complex_networks_of_phase_oscillators_A_survey","260945750_Zero_Forcing_Sets_and_Controllability_of_Dynamical_Systems_Defined_on_Graphs","260586252_Interacting_with_Networks_How_Does_Structure_Relate_to_Controllability_in_Single-Leader_Consensus_Networks","243092610_Strong_Structural_Controllability","226883545_A_Survey_on_Distributed_Estimation_and_Control_Applications_Using_Linear_Consensus_Algorithms","222837874_Generic_properties_and_control_of_linear_structured_systems_A_survey","51731210_Few_inputs_can_reprogram_biological_networks","3029146_On_structural_controllability_theorem","3027079_Structural_Controllability","3026708_Properties_of_Linear_Time-Invariant_Multivariable_Systems_Subject_to_Arbitrary_Output_and_State_Feedback"]}
