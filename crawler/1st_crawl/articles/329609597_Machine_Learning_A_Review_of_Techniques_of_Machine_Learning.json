Machine learning is one of those methods that we use to simplify our day-today problems. Machine learning is basically a field of computer science and a core branch of AI which uses statistics to give outputs. Generally machine learning is the ability of a particular machine to learn from its previous outputs and algorithms, so that it can improve on its own and don't need our regular guidance to update its system. Machine learning defines the steps to supervise machine's performance by learning from its historical inputs. It is the application of artificial intelligence and used to describe the algorithms based on historical data. Nowadays some statistical experts announced that they will adopt the machine learning algorithms and name that field as Statistical Learning. Machine learning focuses on the development of programs in computer system that can access data and use it to learn for itself.","authors":["Pooja","Aakanksha Sharma","Ankush Sharma"],"meta":["December 2018"],"references":["327667356_A_Comparative_Study_Of_Sentiments_Analysis_Using_Rule_Based_and_Support_Vector_Machine"]}
