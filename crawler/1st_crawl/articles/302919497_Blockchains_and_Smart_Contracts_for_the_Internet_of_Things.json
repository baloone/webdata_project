{"id":"302919497_Blockchains_and_Smart_Contracts_for_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.","authors":["Konstantinos Christidis","Michael Devetsikiotis"],"meta":["January 2016IEEE Access 4:1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2566339"],"references":["305401130_A_Fistful_of_Bitcoins_Characterizing_Payments_among_Men_with_No_Names","282692004_Bitcoin-NG_A_Scalable_Blockchain_Protocol","262357109_A_fistful_of_bitcoins_characterizing_payments_among_men_with_no_names","235976346_Quantitative_Analysis_of_the_Full_Bitcoin_Transaction_Graph","2437947_Practical_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance","312391505_In_search_of_an_understandable_consensus_algorithm","306304642_Hawk_The_Blockchain_Model_of_Cryptography_and_Privacy-Preserving_Smart_Contracts","301836504_Non-determinism_in_Byzantine_Fault-Tolerant_Replication","301762992_The_Quest_for_Scalable_Blockchain_Fabric_Proof-of-Work_vs_BFT_Replication","296684539_Bitcoin_and_Beyond_A_Technical_Survey_on_Decentralized_Digital_Currencies","263930348_IPFS_-_Content_Addressed_Versioned_P2P_File_System","262372028_All_about_Eve_Execute-Verify_Replication_for_Multi-Core_Servers","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System","228362550_Sha-3_proposal_blake","221160492_The_Sybil_Attack","220691506_Introduction_to_Reliable_and_Secure_Distributed_Programming_2_ed","2554993_The_Byzantine_Generals_Problem"]}
