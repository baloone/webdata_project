{"id":"357240602_Equity-focused_teaching_in_K-12_CS_strategies_for_teachers_teacher_educators_and_districts","abstract":"In this chapter, we aim to support practitioners in understanding what equity-focused teaching and learning can look like within K-12 computer science learning settings. We unpack key constructs, such as equity and minoritized learners, to offer context for how we identify learners and how we define equity. In providing an overview of a justice-oriented approach to computer science education, along with our rationale for how and why prioritizing asset-or strengths-based approaches are essential in this work, we demonstrate how practitioners can shift the focus in computer science learning further towards justice-oriented approaches. After explaining what it means to use a justice-oriented equity lens in computer science teaching and learning, we offer key considerations when integrating computer science and share how to engage families and communities. In sharing, we hope to provide practical insights and guidance to practitioners for engaging in equity-focused teaching in Key Stage 1-4 and K-12 computer science education. Resources for further learning are also included.","authors":["Tia C.
