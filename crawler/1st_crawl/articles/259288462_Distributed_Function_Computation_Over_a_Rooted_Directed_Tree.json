{"id":"259288462_Distributed_Function_Computation_Over_a_Rooted_Directed_Tree","abstract":"This paper establishes the rate region for a class of source coding function\ncomputation setups where sources of information are available at the nodes of a\ntree and where a function of these sources must be computed at the root. The\nrate region holds for any function as long as the sources' joint distribution\nsatisfies a certain Markov criterion. This criterion is met, in particular,\nwhen the sources are independent.\nThis result recovers the rate regions of several function computation setups.\nThese include the point-to-point communication setting with arbitrary sources,\nthe noiseless multiple access network with \"conditionally independent sources,\"\nand the cascade network with Markovian sources.","authors":["Milad Sefidgaran","Aslan Tchamkerten"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2016.2530398","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257660765_On_Cooperation_in_Multi-Terminal_Computation_and_Rate_Distortion","257660101_Computing_a_Function_of_Correlated_Sources_A_Rate_Region","268320484_Computing_informatics_and_information_theory","266962864_Coding_of_sources_on_the_basis_of_observations_with_incomplete_information","266908024_Network_Information_Theory","266220478_Coding_of_an_information_source_having_ambiguous_alphabet_and_the_entropy_of_graphs","262359899_A_Dichotomy_of_Functions_FX_Y_of_Correlated_Sources_X_Y_from_the_Viewpoint_of_the_Achievable_Rate_Region","261322058_On_function_computation_over_a_cascade_network","261262024_Polynomials_and_computing_functions_of_correlated_sources","260635465_Multi-Session_Function_Computation_and_Multicasting_in_Undirected_Graphs"]}
