{"id":"288890386_On_the_Foundations_of_the_Brussels_Operational-Realistic_Approach_to_Cognition","abstract":"The scientific community is becoming more and more interested in the research\nthat applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to model human\ndecision-making. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of the\nquantum approach to cognition that we developed in Brussels. These foundations\nrest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and\noperational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The\ndeep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to\ninvestigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework\nfor cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models\nderived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of\nthis validity. However, two situations in the cognitive realm, 'question order\neffects' and 'response replicability', indicate that even the Hilbert space\nframework could be insufficient to reproduce the collected data. This does not\nmean that the mentioned operational-realistic approach would be incorrect, but\nsimply that a larger class of measurements would be in force in human\ncognition, so that an extended quantum formalism may be needed to deal with all\nof them. As we will explain, the recently derived 'extended Bloch\nrepresentation' of quantum theory (and the associated 'general\ntension-reduction' model) precisely provides such extended formalism, while\nremaining within the same unitary interpretative framework.","authors":["Diederik Aerts","Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi","Sandro Sozzo"],"meta":["December 2015Frontiers in Physics 4(1583)","DOI:10.3389/fphy.2016.00017","SourcearXiv","Project: Identifying quantum structures in cognition and decision-making under uncertainty"],"references":["283280526_Quantum_information_cognition_and_music","281522691_Interference_effects_of_choice_on_confidence_Quantum_characteristics_of_evidence_accumulation","280695744_Spin_and_Wind_Directions_I_Identifying_Entanglement_in_Nature_and_Cognition","273705013_Quantum_Structure_of_Negation_and_Conjunction_in_Human_Thought","267454471_The_Quantum_Nature_of_Identity_in_Human_Thought_Bose-Einstein_Statistics_for_Conceptual_Indistinguishability","265332203_Information_Dynamics_in_Cognitive_Psychological_Social_and_Anomalous_Phenomena","262520396_The_quantum_mechanics_and_conceptuality_matter_histories_semantics_and_space-time","261512665_The_Extended_Poincare-Bloch_Representation_of_Quantum_Mechanics_and_the_Hidden-Measurement_Solution_to_the_Measurement_Problem","260910548_Quantum_Theory_and_Human_Perception_of_the_Macro-World","260835489_Quantum_Models_for_Psychological_Measurements_An_Unsolved_Problem","259695329_The_Unreasonable_Success_of_Quantum_Probability_I_Quantum_Measurements_as_Uniform_Fluctuations","258843769_Quantum_Social_Science","258764143_An_Introduction_to_QBism_with_an_Application_to_the_Locality_of_Quantum_Mechanics","256613525_Concepts_and_Their_Dynamics_A_Quantum-Theoretic_Modeling_of_Human_Thought","256501776_The_Potential_of_Using_Quantum_Theory_to_Build_Models_of_Cognition","237242265_QUANTUM_PHYSICS_A_theory_of_concepts_and_their_combinations_I_The_structure_of_the_sets_of_contexts_and_properties","236836127_Quantum_structure_and_human_thought","236836126_Can_quantum_probability_provide_a_new_direction_for_cognitive_modeling","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","309476347_Risk_ambiguity_and_the_Savage_axioms","305648572_THE_GTR-MODEL_A_UNIVERSAL_FRAMEWORK_FOR_QUANTUM-LIKE_MEASUREMENTS","285942923_Quantum_Models_of_Cognition_and_Decision","285648172_The_GTR-model_a_universal_framework_for_quantum-like_measurements","283433628_From_Ambiguity_Aversion_to_a_Generalized_Expected_Utility_Modeling_Preferences_in_a_Quantum_Probabilistic_Framework","282526614_Effectiveness_of_the_quantum-mechanical_formalism_in_cognitive_modeling","281084653_Beyond-Quantum_Modeling_of_Question_Order_Effects_and_Response_Replicability_in_Psychological_Measurements","279226866_A_Quantum_Approach_to_Vagueness_and_to_the_Semantics_of_Music","277023655_A_New_Fundamental_Evidence_of_Non-Classical_Structure_in_the_Combination_of_Natural_Concepts","273734383_The_Foundations_of_Statistics","273192904_Bayesian_model_comparison_favors_quantum_over_standard_decision_theory_account_of_dynamic_inconsistency","271224114_Testing_quantum-like_models_of_judgment_for_question_order_effect","270287393_Quantum_Structure_in_Cognition_and_the_Foundations_of_Human_Reasoning","265369041_The_Foundations_Of_Statistics","265333962_Grundbegriffe_der_Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung","264634868_Context_effects_produced_by_question_orders_reveal_quantum_nature_of_human_judgments","261026878_Ambiguity_and_Ambiguity_Aversion","260974991_Quantum_Probability_-_Quantum_Logic","260873169_Solving_the_Hard_Problem_of_Bertrand's_Paradox","260745854_The_Logic_of_Quantum_Mechanics","259695332_The_Unreasonable_Success_of_Quantum_Probability_II_Quantum_Measurements_as_Universal_Measurements","258455894_Ubiquitous_Quantum_Structure","256501710_A_Quantum_Question_Order_Model_Supported_by_Empirical_Tests_of_an_A_Priori_and_Precise_Prediction","249277712_Measuring_New_Types_of_Question-Order_Effects","247931819_The_missing_elements_of_reality_in_the_description_of_quantum_mechanics_of_the_EPR_paradox_situation","245272123_Risk_ambiguity_and_the_Savage_axioms_Reply","243773368_The_Description_of_Separated_Systems_and_Quantum_Mechanics_and_a_Possible_Explanation_for_the_Probabilities_of_Quantum_Mechanics","243773149_A_possible_explanation_for_the_probabilities_of_quantum_mechanics","240286082_The_Disjunction_Effect_in_Choice_Under_Uncertainty","237284528_The_entity_and_modern_physics_The_creation-discovery_view_of_reality","236547112_Foundations_of_quantum_physics","235634026_Identifying_Quantum_Structures_in_the_Ellsberg_Paradox","235634008_Quantum_Entanglement_in_Concept_Combinations","228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","230577581_Overextension_of_Conjunctive_Concepts_Evidence_for_a_Unitary_Model_of_Concept_Typicality_and_Class_Inclusion","228109469_On_the_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox"]}
