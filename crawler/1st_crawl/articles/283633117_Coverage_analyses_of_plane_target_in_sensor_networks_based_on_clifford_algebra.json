{"id":"283633117_Coverage_analyses_of_plane_target_in_sensor_networks_based_on_clifford_algebra","abstract":"Plane target coverage problem is one of sensor networks' fundamental problem for targets coverage. We proposed the coverage analyses methods for plane target in sensor networks based on Clifford algebra. The plane target was described with Clifford algebra. And the computational methods of coverage rate for plane target were also mentioned in sensor networks. We also proposed the algorithm for calculating the maximal breach path of plane target in sensor networks and the experiment proved the efficiency of our method.","authors":["Tiancheng He","W.-M.
