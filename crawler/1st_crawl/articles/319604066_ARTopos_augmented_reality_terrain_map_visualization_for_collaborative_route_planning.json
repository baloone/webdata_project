{"id":"319604066_ARTopos_augmented_reality_terrain_map_visualization_for_collaborative_route_planning","abstract":"Most outdoor activities, such as alpine climbing, cycling, or hiking, require a careful route planning in advance. Today, most routing applications are single-user desktop applications. Furthermore, it is good practice to be able to do paper map based navigation during the trip as a backup. In this work, we propose ARTopos, a concept and implementation of a augmented reality (AR) 3D topographic map visualization, which combines analog paper map planning and digital routing service. It augments paper topographic maps with a digital terrain map suitable for interaction and displaying forecast information. We implemented a first prototype for which we gathered generally positive qualitative feedback as a first initial evaluation. We envision ARTopos as an interactive, collaborative tool can be used during the preliminary trip briefing for most adventurous activities.","authors":["Frederik Wiehr","Florian Daiber","Felix Kosmalla","Antonio Kr√ºger"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1145/3123024.3124446","Conference: the 2017 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and the 2017 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers"],"references":["221786276_Using_Augmented_Reality_to_Plan_Virtual_Construction_Worksite","220090143_Explorations_in_the_Use_of_Augmented_Reality_for_Geographic_Visualization","2493020_Illuminating_Clay_A_3-D_Tangible_Interface_for_Landscape_Analysis","12819963_Spatial_knowledge_acquisition_from_maps_and_from_navigation_in_real_and_virtual_environments"]}
