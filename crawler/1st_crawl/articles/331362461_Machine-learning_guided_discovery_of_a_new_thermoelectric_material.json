{"id":"331362461_Machine-learning_guided_discovery_of_a_new_thermoelectric_material","abstract":"Thermoelectric technologies are becoming indispensable in the quest for a sustainable future. Recently, an emerging phenomenon, the spin-driven thermoelectric effect (STE), has garnered much attention as a promising path towards low cost and versatile thermoelectric technology with easily scalable manufacturing. However, progress in development of STE devices is hindered by the lack of understanding of the fundamental physics and materials properties responsible for the effect. In such nascent scientific field, data-driven approaches relying on statistics and machine learning, instead of more traditional modeling methods, can exhibit their full potential. Here, we use machine learning modeling to establish the key physical parameters controlling STE. Guided by the models, we have carried out actual material synthesis which led to the identification of a novel STE material with a thermopower an order of magnitude larger than that of the current generation of STE devices.","authors":["Yuma Iwasaki","I.
