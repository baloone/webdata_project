{"id":"322615693_Optimal_sizing_for_stand-Alone_micro_grid_based_on_improved_binary_bat_algorithm","abstract":"This paper focuses on the optimal sizing for stand-Alone wind-PV-diesel-battery microgrid. Using the reliability of power supply as the constraint condition and the minimum average annual cost after weighting as the objective function, this paper constructs a non-linear integer programming model for the optimal sizing of microgrid which takes economy, environmental protection and renewable energy utilization of microgrid into consideration. Aiming at the local optimal problem caused by directly applying continuous optimization algorithm into solving discrete optimization model, this paper proposes an improved binary bat algorithm (IBB A), which adopts mutation, crossover and selection operations from differential evolution (DE) to improve the global searching ability of standard BBA. The results of a case study indicate that IBBA shows better performance in terms of both the solution quality and stability compared with genetic algorithm (OA) , particle swarm optimization (PSO) and DE algorithm.","authors":["S.
