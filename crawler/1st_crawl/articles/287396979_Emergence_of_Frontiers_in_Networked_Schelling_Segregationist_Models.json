{"id":"287396979_Emergence_of_Frontiers_in_Networked_Schelling_Segregationist_Models","abstract":"The relation between individuality and aggregation is an important topic in complex systems sciences, both aspects being facets of emergence. This topic has frequently been addressed by adopting a classical, individual versus population level perspective. Here, however, the frontiers that emerge in segregated communities are the focus; segregation is synonymous with the existence of frontiers that delineate and interface aggregates. A generic agent-based model is defined, with which we simulate communities located on grid and scale-free networked environments. Emerging frontiers are analyzed in terms of their relative occupancy, porosity, and permeability. Results emphasize that the frontier is highly sensitive to the topology of the environment, not only to the agent tolerance. These relations are clarified while addressing the topics of frontier robustness and the trade-off between its capacity to separate and allow exchange.","authors":["Philippe Collard","Salma Mesmoudi","Teodor Ghetiu","Fiona A.
