{"id":"220460936_Relevance_feedback_in_image_retrieval_A_comprehensive_review","abstract":"We analyze the nature of the relevance feedback problem in a continuous representation space in the context of multimedia information retrieval. Emphasis is put on exploring the uniqueness of the problem and comparing the assumptions, implementations, and merits of various solutions in the literature. An attempt is made to compile a list of critical issues to consider when designing a relevance feedback algorithm. With a comprehensive review as the main portion, this paper also offers some novel solutions and perspectives throughout the discussion.","authors":["Xiang Sean Zhou","Thomas S.
