{"id":"299416732_Weighted_Partitioning_for_Fast_Multiplier-less_Multiple_Constant_Convolution_Circuit","abstract":"A new radix-3 partitioning method of natural numbers, derived by the weight partition theory, is employed to build a multiplierless circuit that is well suited for multimedia filtering applications. The partitioning method allows conveniently premultiplying 32-b floating-point filter coefficients with the smallest set of parts composing an unsigned integer input. In this way, similar to the distributed arithmetic, shifters and recoding circuitry, typical of other well-known multiplier circuits, are completely substituted with simplified floating-point adders. Compared to the existent literature, targeted to both field-programmable gate array and std_cell technology, the proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art performances in terms of elaboration velocity, achieving a critical path delay of about 2 ns both on a Xilinx Virtex 7 and with CMOS 90-nm std_cells.","authors":["Gian Domenico Licciardo","Carmine Cappetta","Luigi Di Benedetto","Mario Vigliar"],"meta":["January 2016Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, IEEE Transactions on 64(1):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCSII.2016.2546899","Project: VLSI Systems for High Speed, Memory Reduced Image and Video Processing"],"references":["302851025_Hardware_coprocessor_for_stripe-based_interest_point_detection","302848731_Multiplierless_coprocessor_for_difference_of_Gaussian_DoG_calculation","283649640_An_efficient_floating_point_multiplier_design_for_high_speed_applications_using_Karatsuba_algorithm_and_Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam_algorithm","267210880_Efficient_Design_of_FIR_Filters_Using_Hybrid_Multiple_Constant_Multiplications_on_FPGA","260666889_Low-Power_High-Throughput_and_Low-Area_Adaptive_FIR_Filter_Based_on_Distributed_Arithmetic","241639414_High-Performance_SIFT_Hardware_Accelerator_for_Real-Time_Image_Feature_Extraction","224440119_Multiplication_Acceleration_Through_Twin_Precision","220390442_Multiplierless_multiple_constant_multiplication","286244625_An_Efficient_Hardware-Based_Higher_Radix_Floating_Point_MAC_Design","285781671_Stream_Processor_for_Real-Time_Inverse_Tone_Mapping_of_Full-HD_Images","276474257_Pre-Encoded_Multipliers_Based_on_Non-Redundant_Radix-4_Signed-Digit_Encoding","274075955_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","260665441_VLSI_Implementation_of_an_Adaptive_Edge-Enhanced_Image_Scalar_for_Real-Time_Multimedia_Applications","243579278_VLSI_Digital_Signal_Processing_Systems_Design_and_Implementation","224612042_ROM-based_logic_RBL_Design_a_low-power_16_bit_multiplier","220694260_An_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Numbers","220597784_Pyramid_Architecture_for_3840_X_2160_Quad_Full_High_Definition_30_Framess_Video_Acquisition","220187917_The_r-complete_partitions","220187184_Enumeration_of_M-partitions","47536144_Bachet's_Problem_as_few_weights_to_weigh_them_all","3877185_Canonical_signed_digit_representation_for_FIR_digital_filters","3223967_Multiple_constant_multiplications_Efficient_and_versatile_framework_and_algorithms_for_exploring_common_subexpression_elimination","3176046_A_new_hardware_realization_of_digital_filters","2978243_A_Low_Logic_Depth_Complex_Multiplier_Using_Distributed_Arithmetic"]}
