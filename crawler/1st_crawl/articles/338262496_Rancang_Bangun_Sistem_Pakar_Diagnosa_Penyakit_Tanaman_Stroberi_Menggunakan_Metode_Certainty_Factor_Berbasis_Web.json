AI (Artificial Intelligence) is part of a computer science which used the computer to imitate the human thoughts and behavior. The usage of a method in Expert System is very important. Thus, the most compatible method to use is the Certainty Factor method. This method is suitable to be used on Expert System to measure things and diagnosed it, will it be very sure or unsure. For example, Expert System to diagnose disease on strawberry plants. This software allows the user to diagnose the disease on strawberry plants before taking a further action. This software is using PHP programming language and store the data using MySQL system database. When the user consulting to the software, the software will show the symptoms of the disease and the user can choose the level of certainty from the chosen disease symptom. The final result from the software is a form which includes the guide of how to take the measurement of the disease based on the chosen symptoms.","authors":["Nina Mauliana Noor Fajriah"],"meta":["October 2019Repositor 1(1)","DOI:10.22219/repositor.v1i1.18"],"references":["342868218_Sistem_Pakar_Diagnosa_Penyakit_Pohon_Karet_dengan_Metode_Certainty_Factor","323711607_IMPLEMENTASI_SISTEM_PAKAR_UNTUK_MENDIAGNOSIS_PENYAKIT_DENGAN_GEJALA_DEMAM_MENGGUNAKAN_METODE_CERTAINTY_FACTOR","271688416_Integrating_Expert_Systems_and_Decision_Support_Systems","220694415_Expert_systems_Design_and_development"]}
