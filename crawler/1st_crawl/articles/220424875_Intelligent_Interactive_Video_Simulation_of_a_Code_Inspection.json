{"id":"220424875_Intelligent_Interactive_Video_Simulation_of_a_Code_Inspection","abstract":"The Advanced Learning Technologies Project (ALT) at the Software Engineering Institute is applying advanced hardware and software technologies to software engineering education. The content domain of the project is the formal technical review of Ada code. The specific type of review methodology taught is inspection. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate and promote advanced learning technologies that are applied to software engineering education. The project demonstrates the applicability of technologically advanced educational media to software engineering problems. These media include Digital Video Interactive (DVI), hypertext, hypermedia, and intelligent tutoring systems.","authors":["Scott M.
