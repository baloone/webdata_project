{"id":"321967087_Free_skew_monoidal_categories","abstract":"In the paper Triangulations, orientals, and skew monoidal categories, the free skew monoidal category Fsk on a single generating object was described. We sharpen this by giving a completely explicit description of Fsk, and so of the free skew monoidal category on any category. As an application we describe adjunctions between the operad for skew monoidal categories and various simpler operads. For a particular such operad L, we identify skew monoidal categories with certain colax L-algebras.","authors":["John Bourke","Stephen Lack"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 222(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.jpaa.2017.12.006"],"references":["282692748_Skew_structures_in_2-category_theory_and_homotopy_theory"]}
