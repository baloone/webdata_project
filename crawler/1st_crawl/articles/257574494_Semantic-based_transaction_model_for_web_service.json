{"id":"257574494_Semantic-based_transaction_model_for_web_service","abstract":"Cloud computing technology has become more and more utilized in business application in today’s industrial fields. In general, many business systems developed based on web services are indeed heterogeneous software systems that process business data by complying with integrated business rules. Web services have until recently been regarded as software building blocks that can be assembled to construct the distributed business applications of the next generation and assist enterprises to promote operational efficiency and organizational flexibility. As a result, Web services can be employed to improve the integration of value chain processes and/or activities. However, Web services are usually implicit as a black box that prohibits users and developers from comprehending an actual scenario and present status inside the web service component as said developers deal with other associated heterogeneous components. Additionally, developers are unable to increase overall efficiency while integrating Web service components if they do not possess the ability to modify/improve the implementation scenario. This research first defines the component as corresponding state transitions that should be decomposed further into sub-transactions and semantic transactions, which can make possible re-implementation of the specific Web services in an efficient way and increase the overall throughputs for the new composite Web services. Secondly, this study implements an MTNet Project, which can be employed to assist developers’ analysis and construction of the semantic models for Web services according to the previously described definitions. Last, the simulation experiment provided in this manuscript proved that the proposed semantic model can indeed improve the throughput and, consequently, decrease the delay time for concurrent transactions.","authors":["Shing-Han Li","Shi Ming Huang","David C Yen","Jui-Chang Sun"],"meta":["April 2013Information Systems Frontiers 15(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10796-013-9409-x"],"references":["281448825_Web_Service_Composition_through_BPEL_Using_Intalio","239765927_A_Petri_Net_Approach_to_Mediation-Aided_Composition_of_Web_Services","228424798_Transaction_Management_in_Active_Heterogeneous_Database_Systems","224226952_CloudTPS_Scalable_Transactions_for_Web_Applications_in_the_Cloud","221050479_A_Business-Aware_Web_Services_Transaction_Model","220416491_A_Study_on_the_Management_of_Semantic_Transaction_for_Efficient_Data_Retrieval","220403293_Association-based_dynamic_computation_of_reputation_in_web_services","220403236_A_reference_model_for_dynamic_web_service_composition_systems","220373670_Accelerating_Web_Service_Workflow_Execution_via_Intelligent_Allocation_of_Services_to_Servers","4359240_A_Model-Driven_Approach_to_Service_Orchestration","3985770_Workflow-based_composition_of_WEB-services_A_business_model_or_a_programming_paradigm","3776422_A_semantic-based_transaction_model_for_active_heterogeneous_database_systems","3454308_Customized_Delivery_of_E-Government_Web_Services","3419702_Composing_Web_services_A_QoS_view","3419474_Unraveling_the_web_services_web_an_introduction_to_SOAP_WSDL_and_UDDI","2433801_A_Performance_Study_of_Distributed_Architectures_for_the_Quality_of_Web_Services","286985789_Research_on_dynamic_web_service_composition_with_QoS_global_optimization_in_BPEL","278715968_Web_Service_Composition_through_BPEL_Using_Intalio","267403901_Framework_of_Analyzing_Service-Centric_Cluster_Supply_Chain_A_Case_Study_of_Collaborative_Procurement","267024256_A_Semantic_Model_to_Characterize_Pricing_and_Negotiation_Schemes_of_Cloud_Resources","264880127_A_process_meta-model_based_approach_for_development_of_collaborative_applications_built_on_workflow_and_SOA","264819275_Development_of_context-aware_web_services_using_the_MDA_approach","258950396_Simulation_Modeling_and_Analysis","258493931_An_Overview_of_Web_Services_Composition_Approaches","245591459_Business_Process_Execution_Language_for_Web_Services_Version_1","241745115_Developing_an_Effective_Mobile_Rescue_Support_System","233735170_An_ontology_intelligent_agent-based_framework_for_the_provision_of_semantic_web_services","227072243_Working_of_Web_Services_Using_BPEL_Workflow_in_SOA","226579344_Enterprise_Tomography_Driven_Governance_of_Federated_ERP_in_a_Cloud","225039116_An_ontology_intelligent_agent-based_framework_for_the_provision_of_semantic_web_services","223564701_Analysis_of_workflow_dynamic_changes_based_on_Petri_net","222537692_VxBPEL_Supporting_variability_for_Web_services_in_BPEL","222408599_Dynamic_workflow_model_fragmentation_for_distributed_execution","220595107_Security_Policy_Composition_for_Composite_Web_Services","220473780_Event_correlation_for_process_discovery_from_Web_service_interaction_logs","220422787_The_next_step_in_Web_Services","220421852_Using_the_Web_Service_modeling_ontology_to_enable_semantic_e-business","220420881_Business_-_Oriented_management_of_Web_services","46389850_Enabling_Semantic_Web_Services","4034713_Service-Oriented_Workflow_The_DySCo_Framework","3419515_QoS_issues_in_Web_services","3249476_Orchestrating_Web_services_with_BPEL"]}
