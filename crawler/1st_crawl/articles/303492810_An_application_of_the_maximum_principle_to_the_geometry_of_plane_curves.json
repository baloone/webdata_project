{"id":"303492810_An_application_of_the_maximum_principle_to_the_geometry_of_plane_curves","abstract":"The maximum principle of control theory is used to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a plane curve, which has bounded piecewise continuous curvature and prescribed initial and terminal points and directions, to have minimal length. This result is used to prove that such a closed curve having length L and curvature k satisfying \\k\\≦K can be contained in a circle of radius R, where R≦L\\4-(π-2)\\2K.","authors":["Harold H.
