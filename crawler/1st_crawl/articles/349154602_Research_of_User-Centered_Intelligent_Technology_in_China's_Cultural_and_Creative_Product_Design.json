{"id":"349154602_Research_of_User-Centered_Intelligent_Technology_in_China's_Cultural_and_Creative_Product_Design","abstract":"With the development of computer science, “user-centered” design assisted by intelligent technology is a new trend in China’s cultural and creative design. To clarify the research progress, the author reviewed the representative predecessor’s works in China, summarized a design process paradigm from their works, and classified the various design methods into a reasonable framework by manual content analysis. However, some problems still exist. The first is lack of intelligent design method promotion, and the other is the researchers are unaware that cultural and creative design has developed to a state with blurred boundary, in which the design not only means the design of cultural and creative products but also includes the design of exhibitions and education activities.","authors":["Cheng Hui"],"meta":["January 2021E3S Web of Conferences 236(2):04050","DOI:10.1051/e3sconf/202123604050"],"references":["221097937_Digital_Archive_Database_for_Cultural_Product_Design"]}
