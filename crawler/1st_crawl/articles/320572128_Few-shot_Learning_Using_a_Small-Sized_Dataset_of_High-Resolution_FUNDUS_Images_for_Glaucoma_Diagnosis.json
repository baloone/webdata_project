{"id":"320572128_Few-shot_Learning_Using_a_Small-Sized_Dataset_of_High-Resolution_FUNDUS_Images_for_Glaucoma_Diagnosis","abstract":"Deep learning has recently attracted a lot of attention, mainly thanks to substantial gains in terms of effectiveness. However, there is still room for significant improvement, especially when dealing with use cases that come with a limited availability of data, as is often the case in the area of medical image analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for early diagnosis of glaucoma in high-resolution FUNDUS images, only requiring a small number of training samples. In particular, we developed a predictive model based on a matching neural network architecture, integrating a high-resolution deep convolutional network that allows preserving the high-fidelity nature of the medical images. Our experimental results show that our predictive model is able to obtain higher levels of effectiveness than vanilla deep convolutional neural networks.","authors":["Mijung Kim","Jasper Zuallaert","Wesley De Neve"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1145/3132635.3132650","Conference: the 2nd International Workshop"],"references":["315492554_High-Resolution_Breast_Cancer_Screening_with_Multi-View_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311164419_Artificial_Intelligence_With_Deep_Learning_Technology_Looks_Into_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Screening","305881526_Matching_Networks_for_One_Shot_Learning","303367197_One-shot_Learning_with_Memory-Augmented_Neural_Networks","277411157_Deep_Learning","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","2375370_A_Perspective_View_And_Survey_Of_Meta-Learning","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267157056_Neural_Turing_Machines","262243796_Lifelong_Learning_Algorithms","7288149_The_number_of_people_with_glaucoma_worldwide_in_2010_and_2020"]}
