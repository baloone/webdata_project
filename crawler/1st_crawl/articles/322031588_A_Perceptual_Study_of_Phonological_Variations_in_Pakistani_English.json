{"id":"322031588_A_Perceptual_Study_of_Phonological_Variations_in_Pakistani_English","abstract":"The present study examines the perceptual judgments of English lexical items and English lexical stress by Urdu ESL (Note 1) (English as Second Language) learners. The analysis discusses the different sound systems of both languages and their syllabification system coupled with the stress patterns. The stimuli of 50 high frequency English words were designed as data collection tool for counting the number of syllables and for marking lexical stress as follows: 9 monosyllabic, 11 disyllabic, 10 tri-syllabic, 10 four-syllabic and 10 five-syllabic words. All participating subjects were 40 under graduate students from the department of computer sciences, Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) Karachi. The findings of the study show English lexical items were syllabified with different numbers and primary stressed syllables were also marked with different places of the lexical items, however, data also show the correct syllabification and the right placement of lexical stress which is a strong evidence manifesting as Urdu-accented English perceived and produced by Urdu ESL learners.","authors":["Dr Abdul Malik Abbasi","Mansoor A Channa","Inayatullah Kakepoto","Rida Ali"],"meta":["December 2017International Journal of English Linguistics 8(2):92","DOI:10.5539/ijel.v8n2p92","Project: Pakistani English"],"references":["318814729_The_Stress_Pattern_of_Sindhi_English","289076909_Phonetic_Analysis_of_Lexical_Stress_in_Sindhi","288944290_The_Role_of_Pitch_between_Stress_and_Intonation_in_Sindhi","282655474_Syllable_Structure_and_Syllabification_in_Sindhi-English_Loanwords","303517654_The_principles_of_the_international_phonetic_association","271017612_Vowels_and_Consonants","270178735_The_Indo-Aryan_Languages","44414526_A_dictionary_of_linguistics_and_phonetics_David_Crystal","36817455_English_Pronouncing_Dictionary"]}
