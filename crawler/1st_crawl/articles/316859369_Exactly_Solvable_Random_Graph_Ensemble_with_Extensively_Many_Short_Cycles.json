{"id":"316859369_Exactly_Solvable_Random_Graph_Ensemble_with_Extensively_Many_Short_Cycles","abstract":"We introduce and analyse ensembles of 2-regular random graphs with a tuneable distribution of short cycles. The phenomenology of these graphs depends critically on the scaling of the ensembles' control parameters relative to the number of nodes. A phase diagram is presented, showing a second order phase transition from a connected to a disconnected phase. We study both the canonical formulation, where the size is large but fixed, and the grand canonical formulation, where the size is sampled from a discrete distribution, and show their equivalence in the thermodynamical limit. We also compute analytically the spectral density, which consists of a discrete set of isolated eigenvalues, representing short cycles, and a continuous part, representing cycles of diverging size.","authors":["Fabian Aguirre Lopez","Paolo Barucca","Mathilde Fekom","Anthony CC Coolen"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Physics A Mathematical and Theoretical 51(8)","DOI:10.1088/1751-8121/aaa555","Project: Maximum entropy ensembles of random loopy graphs"],"references":["300370915_Replica_methods_for_loopy_sparse_random_graphs","287853729_A_Detailed_Investigation_into_Near_Degenerate_Exponential_Random_Graphs","267872239_Triadic_closure_as_a_basic_generating_mechanism_of_communities_in_complex_networks","311882497_Eigenvalue_tunneling_and_decay_of_quenched_random_network","305973305_The_random_triangle_model","262319902_A_Critical_Point_for_Random_Graphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","247650049_Stochastic_Blockmodels_First_Steps","246994359_On_a_General_Class_of_Models_for_Interaction","223127577_The_asymptotic_number_of_labeled_graphs_with_given_degree_sequence","222694759_A_Model_for_Social_Networks"]}
