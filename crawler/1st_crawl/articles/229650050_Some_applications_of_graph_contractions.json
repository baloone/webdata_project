White's conjecture on the genus of subgroups are shown to be immediate consequences of a lemma which has already proved useful in investigating topological properties and automorphism group of graphs.","authors":["László Babai"],"meta":["October 2006Journal of Graph Theory 1(2):125 - 130","DOI:10.1002/jgt.3190010207"],"references":["242503674_Graphs_Groups_and_Surfaces","321432230_On_a_class_of_fixed-point-free_graphs1","248390389_Graphs_of_degree_3_with_given_abstract_group","243763641_On_a_Class_of_Fixed-Point-Free_Graphs","242963606_Groups_of_graphs_on_given_surfaces","220186736_Automorphism_groups_of_graphs_and_edge-contraction"]}
