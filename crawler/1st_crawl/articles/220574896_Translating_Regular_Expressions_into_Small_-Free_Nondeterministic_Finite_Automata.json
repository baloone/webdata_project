{"id":"220574896_Translating_Regular_Expressions_into_Small_-Free_Nondeterministic_Finite_Automata","abstract":"It is proved that every regular expression of size n can be converted into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) of size O(n(log n)2) in polynomial time. The best previous conversions result in NFAs of worst case size (n\n2). Moreover, the nonexistence of any linear conversion is proved: we give a language L\n\nn\ndescribed by a regular expression of size O(n) such that every NFA accepting L\n\nn\nis of size (n log n).","authors":["Juraj Hromkovic","Sebastian Seibert","Thomas Wilke"],"meta":["January 2001Journal of Computer and System Sciences 62:565-588","DOI:10.1007/BFb0023448","SourceDBLP"],"references":["230876408_Finite_Automata_and_Their_Decision_Problems","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","247112797_Parsing_Theory_Languages_and_Parsing","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","222864170_Complexity_measures_for_regular_expressions","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","3045618_Ambiguity_in_Graphs_and_Expressions"]}
