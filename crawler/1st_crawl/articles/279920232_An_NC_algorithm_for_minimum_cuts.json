{"id":"279920232_An_NC_algorithm_for_minimum_cuts","abstract":"We show that the minimum-cut problem for weighted undirected graphs can be solved in NC using time separate and independently interesting results. The first is an (m 2/n)-processor NC algorithm for finding a (2 + ∈)-approximation to the minimum cut. The second is a randomized reduction from the minimum-cut problem to the problem of obtaining a (2 + ∈)-approximation to the minimum cut. This reduction involves a natural combinatorial set-isolation problem that can be solved easily in RNC. The third result is a derandomization of this RNC solution that requires a combination of two widely used tools: pairwise independence and random walks on expanders. We believe that the set-isolation approach will prove useful in other derandomization problems. The techniques extend to two related problems: we describe NC algorithms finding minimum k-way cuts for any constant k and finding all cuts of value within any constant factor of the minimum. Another application of these techniques yields an NC algorithm for finding a sparse k-connectivity certificate for all polynomially bounded values of k. Previously, an NC construction was only known for polylogarithmic values of k.","authors":["D.R. Karger","R.
