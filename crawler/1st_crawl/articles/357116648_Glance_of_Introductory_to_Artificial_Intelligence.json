{"id":"357116648_Glance_of_Introductory_to_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"AI manages the thesis and exercise of enhancing systems that reveal the features associated with intelligence in humans.AI is very board cross-disciplinary area which has origin in and bisect with many domains.AI is creeping into our everyday life. This paper mainly focuses on basics of Artificial intelligence. This system is working all over the world.AI involves studying the problems rather than studying people It involves fields like computer science, mathematics, philosophy, machine learning, and linguistic. Computers can take their own decisions. An important component of an intelligent environment is to anticipate actions of human inhabitant and then automate them. This research outlines how it is in the support of the society. Heuristics supplies. AI system with a process for focusing its observation and manages its searching activities. The crucial problems of AI can be summarized as perception, learning, reasoning. Now a days AI is more common part of daily life. In this research we learnt about the speech driven services like Siri, Google are used by millions of people in their routine life. Internet is converting all the fields of knowledge into one bright light. AI provides direct communication path.AI can perform various actions and execute decision making. It is limited to functioning in time dimensions like creators.AI application in healthcare is not for doctor s but also patients, health services and medical","authors":["Pilli Shankar","Gandrapu Gayathri","Gogada Shyam","Mohammed Sharika Muskan"],"meta":["December 2021"],"references":["350831546_Conceptual_Glance_of_Genetic_Algorithms_in_the_Detection_of_Heart_Diseases","344804622_HEART_DISEASE_DETECTION_BY_ENHANCING_THE_TRAINING_PHASE_OF_NEURAL_NETWORKS_USING_ACO_ALGORITHM_ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION","344804413_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Swarm_Intelligence_Algorithms_in_the_Detection_of_Heart_Disease"]}
