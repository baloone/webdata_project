{"id":"257512749_Comparative_investigation_of_non-linear_activation_functions_in_neural_controllers_for_search-based_game_AI_engineering","abstract":"The creation of intelligent video game controllers has recently become one of the greatest challenges in game artificial intelligence research, and it is arguably one of the fastest-growing areas in game design and development. The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviorsâ€™ or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.","authors":["Tse Guan Tan","Jason Teo","Patricia Anthony"],"meta":["January 2014Artificial Intelligence Review 41(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10462-011-9294-y"],"references":["307149587_Survey_of_Neural_Transfer_Functions","266891175_USE_OF_HYPERSPECTRAL_IMAGE_ANALYSIS_AND_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TO_PREDICT_QUALITY_CHANGES_IN_COATED_AND_UNCOATED_AVOCADOS_DURING_STORAGE_AT_DIFFERENT_TEMPERATURES","232627919_Suitable_MLP_Network_Activation_Functions_for_Breast_Cancer_and_Thyroid_Disease_Detection","228813985_Performance_Analysis_of_Various_Activation_Functions_in_Generalized_MLP_Architectures_of_Neural_Networks","225165990_Comparison_of_new_activation_functions_in_neural_network_for_forecasting_financial_time_series","4326313_A_Neural_Network_Implementation_on_an_Inexpensive_Eight_Bit_Microcontroller","3857831_Taxonomy_of_neural_transfer_functions","270558903_The_Comparison_of_Activation_Functions_for_Multispectral_Landsat_TM_Image_Classification","242118815_A_Neural_Network_Model_to_Estimate_Aircraft_Fuel_Consumption","236389661_Heuristics_Intelligent_Search_Strategies_for_Computer_Problem_Solving","221900799_Neural_Networks_and_Learning_Machine","221435262_A_Study_on_Neural_Networks_Using_Taylor_Series_Expansion_of_Sigmoid_Activation_Function","7779056_Biological_engineering_applications_of_feedforward_neural_networks_designed_and_parameterized_by_genetic_algorithms"]}
