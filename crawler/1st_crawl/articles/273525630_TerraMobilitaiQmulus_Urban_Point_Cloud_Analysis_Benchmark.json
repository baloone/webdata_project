{"id":"273525630_TerraMobilitaiQmulus_Urban_Point_Cloud_Analysis_Benchmark","abstract":"The objective of the TerraMobilita/iQmulus 3D urban analysis benchmark is to evaluate the current state of the art in urban scene analysis from mobile laser scanning (MLS) at large scale. A very detailed semantic tree for urban scenes is proposed. We call analysis the capacity of a method to separate the points of the scene into these categories (classification), and to separate the different objects of the same type for object classes (detection). A very large ground truth is produced manually in two steps using advanced editing tools developed especially for this benchmark. Based on this ground truth, the benchmark aims at evaluating the classification, detection and segmentation quality of the submitted results.","authors":["Bruno Vallet","Mathieu Brédif","Andrés Serna","B.
