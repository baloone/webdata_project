{"id":"325382978_Effects_of_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_Teaching_System_for_Environmental_Education_on_Environmental_Knowledge_and_Attitude","abstract":"The emergence of computers resulted in the application revolution to instruction; till the emergence of the Internet, the strong communication ability became the major role and fully developed the integration of technology and network. The emergence of artificial intelligence teaching systems really fulfilled leaner-centered learning. Based on learner needs, the design changed the learning interaction in automatic teaching from the interaction with machines to the interaction with knowledge. With quasi-experimental study, total 186 college students, as the research object, are proceeded 16-week (3 hours per week for total 48 hours) environmental education with artificial intelligence teaching systems. The research results conclude significant correlations between 1.environmental education and environmental knowledge, 2.environmental knowledge and environmental attitude, and 3.environmental education and environmental attitude. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to reinforce the teaching ability of environmental education, cultivate college students' understanding of environment, enhance environmental protection knowledge, attitude, and action intention, as well as promote the skill to use environmental action strategies.","authors":["Shien-Ping Huang"],"meta":["May 2018Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 14(7):3277-3284","DOI:10.29333/ejmste/91248"],"references":["321751504_A_Study_of_the_New_Environmental_Paradigm_Scale_in_the_Context_of_Iran","344920550_Design_and_Evaluation_of_a_Web-Based_Tool_for_Teaching_Computer_Network_Design_to_Undergraduates","315953267_Augmented_reality_and_pedestrian_navigation_through_its_implementation_in_m-learning_and_e-learning_Evaluation_of_an_educational_program_in_Chile","314760887_Mobile-based_assessment_Investigating_the_factors_that_influence_behavioral_intention_to_use","311934714_The_effect_of_a_mobile-application_tool_on_biology_students'_motivation_and_achievement_in_species_identification_A_Self-Determination_Theory_perspective","303592532_Knowledge_sharing_behaviors_in_e-learning_community_Exploring_the_role_of_academic_self-efficacy_and_sense_of_community","299588143_Fostering_pre-service_teachers'_self-regulated_learning_through_self-_and_peer_assessment_of_wiki_projects","297765077_Twitter_as_a_learning_community_in_higher_education","297719113_Visual_programming_languages_integrated_across_the_curriculum_in_elementary_school_A_two_year_case_study_using_Scratch_in_five_schools","296688440_Training_nursing_students'_communication_skills_with_online_video_peer_assessment"]}
