{"id":"288890271_Packing_spanning_graphs_from_separable_families","abstract":"Let $\\mathcal G$ be a separable family of graphs. Then for all positive\nconstants $\\epsilon$ and $\\Delta$ and for every sufficiently large integer $n$,\nevery sequence $G_1,\\dotsc,G_t\\in\\mathcal G$ of graphs of order $n$ and maximum\ndegree at most $\\Delta$ such that $e(G_1)+\\dotsb+e(G_t) \\leq\n(1-\\epsilon)\\binom{n}{2}$ packs into $K_n$. This improves results of\nB\\\"ottcher, Hladk\\'y, Piguet, and Taraz when $\\mathcal G$ is the class of trees\nand of Messuti, R\\\"odl, and Schacht in the case of a general separable family.\nThe result also implies an approximate version of the Tree Packing Conjecture\nof Gy\\'arf\\'as (1976) for the case that all trees have maximum degree at most\n$\\Delta$.\nThe proof uses the local resilience of random graphs and a special\nmulti-stage packing procedure.","authors":["Asaf Ferber","Choongbum Lee","Frank Mousset"],"meta":["December 2015Israel Journal of Mathematics 219(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11856-017-1504-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321444126_A_separator_theorem_for_nonplanar_graphs","301898305_On_the_decomposition_threshold_of_a_given_graph","301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","301648373_A_blow-up_lemma_for_approximate_decompositions","284132877_Packing_minor_closed_families_of_graphs","283279864_Packing_large_trees_of_consecutive_orders","267214293_Edge-decompositions_of_graphs_with_high_minimum_degree","266977409_Packing_trees_of_bounded_diameter_into_the_complete_graph","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n","266354976_Concentration"]}
