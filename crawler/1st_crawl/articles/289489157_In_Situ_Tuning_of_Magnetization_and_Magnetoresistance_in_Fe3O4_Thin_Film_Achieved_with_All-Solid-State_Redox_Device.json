{"id":"289489157_In_Situ_Tuning_of_Magnetization_and_Magnetoresistance_in_Fe3O4_Thin_Film_Achieved_with_All-Solid-State_Redox_Device","abstract":"An all-solid-state redox device composed of Fe3O4 thin film and Li(+) ion conducting solid electrolyte was fabricated for use in tuning magnetization and magnetoresistance (MR), which are key factors in the creation of high-density magnetic storage devices. Electrical conductivity, magnetization, and MR were reversibly tuned by Li(+) insertion and removal. Tuning of the various Fe3O4 thin film properties was achieved by donation of an electron to the Fe(3+) ions. This technique should lead to the development of spintronics devices based on the reversible switching of magnetization and spin polarization (P). It should also improve the performance of conventional magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices in which the ON/OFF ratio has been limited to a small value due to a decrease in P near the tunnel barrier.","authors":["Takashi Tsuchiya","Kazuya Terabe","Masanori Ochi","Tohru Higuchi"],"meta":["January 2016ACS Nano 10(1)","DOI:10.1021/acsnano.5b07374"],"references":["258304614_Room_temperature_redox_reaction_by_oxide_ion_migration_at_carbonGd-doped_CeO2_heterointerface_probed_by_an_in_situ_hard_x-ray_photoemission_and_soft_x-ray_absorption_spectroscopies","252902780_Negative_spin_polarization_of_the_Fe_3_O_4_g_-_Al_2_O_3_interface_measured_by_spin-resolved_photoemission","236217938_Large_inverse_magnetoresistance_in_fully_epitaxial_FeFe3O4MgOCo_magnetic_tunnel_junctions","234843611_Present_status_of_the_NIMS_contract_beamline_BL15XU_at_SPring-8","225580203_Mechanism_of_grain-boundary_magnetoresistance_in_Fe_O_films","221667610_Electric_Field_Control_of_the_Verwey_Transition_and_InducedMagnetoelectric_Effect_in_Magnetite","11642910_Spintronics_A_Spin-Based_Electronics_Vision_for_the_Future","8203348_Giant_Tunneling_Magnetoresistance_at_Room_Temperature_with_MgO100_Tunnel_Barriers","8203347_Giant_Room-Temperature_Magnetoresistance_in_Single-Crystal_FeMgOFe_Magnetic_Tunnel_Junctions","281574138_Modulation_of_superconducting_critical_temperature_in_niobium_film_by_using_all-solid-state_electric-double-layer_transistor","278155185_Magnetic_properties_of_epitaxial_Fe3O4_films_with_various_crystal_orientations_and_tunnel_magnetoresistance_effect_at_room_temperature","275424196_Characterization_of_Stable_Solid_Electrolyte_Lithium_Silicate_for_Thin_Film_Lithium_Battery","271598434_In_Situ_and_Nonvolatile_Photoluminescence_Tuning_and_Nanodomain_Writing_Demonstrated_by_All-Solid-State_Devices_Based_on_Graphene_Oxide","271138297_Micro_x-ray_photoemission_and_Raman_spectroscopic_studies_on_bandgap_tuning_of_graphene_oxide_achieved_by_solid_state_ionics_device","266637114_Electrochemical_Lithium_Insertion_of_Iron_Oxide_Spinel_Thin_Films_and_Nanoparticles_Changes_in_Structure_and_Magnetic_Properties","264589122_The_solid-state_electrochemical_reduction_process_of_magnetite_in_Li_batteries_In_situ_magnetic_measurements_toward_electrochemical_magnets","262825220_In_Situ_and_Non-Volatile_Bandgap_Tuning_of_Multilayer_Graphene_Oxide_in_an_All-Solid-State_Electric_Double-Layer_Transistor","260126448_Application_of_hard_X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy_to_electronic_structure_measurements_for_various_functional_materials","259118041_Direct_observation_of_redox_state_modulation_at_carbonamorphous_tantalum_oxide_thin_film_hetero-interface_probed_by_means_of_in_situ_hard_X-ray_photoemission_spectroscopy","257974193_Magnetism_and_magnetotransport_in_symmetry_matched_spinels_Fe3O4MgAl2O4","257974064_Bias-voltage_application_in_a_hard_x-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopic_study_of_the_interface_states_at_oxideSi100_interfaces","257966270_Bias_application_hard_x-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy_study_of_forming_process_of_CuHfO2Pt_resistive_random_access_memory_structure","257822107_Magnetization_of_lithiated_magnetite_LixFe3O4","252182238_Magnetoresistance_of_polycrystalline_Fe3O4_films_prepared_by_reactive_sputtering_at_room_temperature","248272759_Structural_characterization_of_the_lithiated_iron_oxides_LixFe3O4_and_LixFe2O3_0x2","243560135_Band_Structure_in_the_High_Temperature_Phase_of_Fe3O4","241225175_Oxygen_migration_at_PtHfO2Pt_interface_under_bias_operation","235573929_Magneto-optic_spectra_and_the_dielectric_tensor_elements_of_bismuth-substituted_iron_garnets_at_photon_energies_between_22-52_eV","234846717_Large_room-temperature_inverse_magnetoresistance_in_tunnel_junctions_with_a_Fe3O4_electrode","224507857_Structural_and_magnetic_characterization_of_the_lithiated_iron_oxide_LixFe3O4","224489917_Electrical_properties_of_MgO_insulating_layers_in_spin-dependent_tunneling_junctions_using_Fe3O4","224407371_Spin-polarized_conduction_in_oxide_magnetic_tunnel_junctions_with_magnetic_and_nonmagnetic_insulating_barrier_layers","223696591_Structure_and_electrochemistry_of_lithium_cobalt_oxide_synthesised_at_400C","222455991_Tunneling_Between_Ferromagnetic_Films","216328890_LixCoO2_0x1_A_new_Cathode_Material_for_Batteries_of_High_Energy_Density","51743189_Tunable_electrical_and_magnetic_properties_of_half-metallic_ZnxFe3-xO4_from_first_principles","13306340_Theory_of_Tunneling_Magnetoresistance_in_Granular_Magnetic_Films","10963915_Negative_Spin_Polarization_of_F_e_3_O_4_in_MagnetiteManganite-Based_Junctions"]}
