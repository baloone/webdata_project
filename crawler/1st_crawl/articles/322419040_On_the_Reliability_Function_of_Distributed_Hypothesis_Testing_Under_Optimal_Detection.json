{"id":"322419040_On_the_Reliability_Function_of_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing_Under_Optimal_Detection","abstract":"The distributed hypothesis-testing problem with full side-information is studied. The trade-off (reliability function) between the type 1 and type 2 error exponents under limited rate is studied in the following way. First, the problem of determining the reliability function of distributed hypothesis-testing is reduced to the problem of determining the reliability function of channel-detection codes (in analogy to a similar result which connects the reliability of distributed compression and ordinary channel codes). Second, a single-letter random-coding bound based on an hierarchical ensemble, as well as a single-letter expurgated bound, are derived for the reliability of channel-detection codes. Both bounds are derived for the optimal detection rule. We believe that the resulting bounds are ensemble-tight, and hence optimal within the class of quantization-and-binning schemes.","authors":["Nir Weinberger","Yuval Kochman"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 65(8)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2019.2910065"],"references":["319164117_Hypothesis_Testing_In_Multi-Hop_Networks","319121594_On_Hypothesis_Testing_Against_Independence_with_Multiple_Decision_Centers","315795280_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing_Over_Noisy_Channels","284732026_Distributed_Testing_with_Zero-rate_Compression","275974635_On_the_Reliability_Function_of_Variable-Rate_Slepian-Wolf_Coding","274312504_Distributed_Testing_with_Zero-rate_Compression","273792780_Optimum_Tradeoffs_Between_the_Error_Exponent_and_the_Excess-Rate_Exponent_of_Variable-Rate_Slepian-Wolf_Coding","237099513_Communication_Under_Strong_Asynchronism","224671458_Error_bound_of_hypothesis_testing_with_data_compression","224363939_Relations_Between_Random_Coding_Exponents_and_the_Statistical_Physics_of_Random_Codes","220681812_Statistical_Inference_Under_Multiterminal_Data_Compression","220220640_Information_Theory_and_Statistics_A_Tutorial","220220637_Statistical_Physics_and_Information_Theory","327080755_On_the_Reliability_Function_of_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing_Under_Optimal_Detection","321383220_Neyman-Pearson_Test_for_Zero-Rate_Multiterminal_Hypothesis_Testing","319374845_Distributed_hypothesis_testing_over_noisy_channels","319367152_Neyman-Pearson_test_for_zero-rate_multiterminal_hypothesis_testing","318738922_Channel_Detection_in_Coded_Communication","316791699_An_Introduction_to_Signal_Detection_and_Estimation","314265899_A_new_approach_to_distributed_hypothesis_testing","312252344_A_Large_Deviations_Approach_to_Secure_Lossy_Compression","310953425_Neyman-Pearson_Test_for_Zero-Rate_Multiterminal_Hypothesis_Testing","309496174_Binary_distributed_hypothesis_testing_via_Korner-Marton_coding","306013977_On_the_necessity_of_binning_for_the_distributed_hypothesis_testing_problem","301878949_Collaborative_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing","301375947_On_secure_distributed_hypothesis_testing","289587750_Distributed_Binary_Detection_With_Lossy_Data_Compression","278333835_Error_Exponent_for_Multiple_Access_Channels_Upper_Bounds","275581494_Probability_Theory_I","266965473_Principles_of_mathematical_analysis_2nd_ed_Translation_from_the_English_ed_by_VP_Havin","266962864_Coding_of_sources_on_the_basis_of_observations_with_incomplete_information","266908024_Network_Information_Theory","266063828_Information_Theory_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Memoryless_Systems","265978139_Information_geometry_and_alternating_minimization_procedures","264791778_Codeword_or_Noise_Exact_Random_Coding_Exponents_for_Joint_Detection_and_Decoding","264743824_Error_Exponent_for_Multiple-Access_Channels_Lower_Bounds","263050857_Renyi_Divergence_and_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence","261233909_Hypothesis_testing_via_a_comparator","261116467_Interactive_hypothesis_testing_against_independence","252473349_An_Introduction_to_Signal_Detection_and_Estimation","245739666_Computation_of_Channel_Capacity_and_Rate-Distortion","224260384_Error_exponents_in_asynchronous_communication","220683727_Graph_decomposition_A_new_key_to_coding_theorems","220682784_Hypothesis_Testing_with_Multiterminal_Data_Compression","220681452_The_rate-distortion_function_for_source_coding_with_side_information_at_the_decoder","200524441_On_measures_of_entropy_and_information","48198898_On_the_Optimality_of_Binning_for_Distributed_Hypothesis_Testing","38365759_Asymptotically_Optimal_Tests_for_Multinomial_Distributions","38347788_On_General_Minimax_Theorems","29869803_Coloring_hypergraphs_A_new_approach_to_multi-user_source_coding_2","29869537_Bounds_on_conditional_probabilities_with_applications_in_multi-user_communication","3086339_Achievable_Error_Exponents_for_the_Private_Fingerprinting_Game","29869788_Source_encoding_with_side_information_and_a_converse_for_degraded_broadcast_channels","3087045_Successive_Refinement_for_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Lossless_One-Helper_Problem","3085520_On_Error_Exponents_in_Hypothesis_Testing"]}
