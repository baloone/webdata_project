{"id":"276159992_It's_not_About_seat_time_Blending_Fipping_and_Efficiency_in_Active_Learning_Classrooms","abstract":"This study examines the effect of reducing the seat time of a large lecture chemistry class by two-thirds and conducting it in an active learning classroom rather than a traditional amphitheater. To account for the reduced lecture, didactic content was recorded and posted online for viewing outside of the classroom. A second experimental section, also in a blended and flipped format, was examined the following semester as a replication. To measure student subject-matter learning, we used a standardized multiple-choice exam, and to measure student perceptions of the classroom, we used a validated survey instrument. Our findings demonstrated that in an active learning classroom, student faculty contact could be reduced by two-thirds and students achieved learning outcomes that were at least as good, and in one comparison significantly better than, those in a traditional classroom. Concurrently, student perceptions of the learning environment were improved. This suggests that pedagogically speaking, active learning classrooms, though they seat fewer students per square foot, are actually a more efficient use of physical space.","authors":["Paul Baepler","Jd Walker","Michelle Driessen"],"meta":["September 2014Computers & Education 78:227-236","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2014.06.006"],"references":["264467167_Pedagogies_of_Engagement_Classroom-Based_Practices","263337857_Are_contextual_and_designed_student-student_interaction_treatments_equally_effective_in_distance_education","260678037_A_meta-analysis_of_blended_learning_and_technology_use_in_higher_education_From_the_general_to_the_applied","258477665_Emerging_practice_and_research_in_blended_learning","256703922_Flipping_the_Classroom_to_Improve_Student_Performance_and_Satisfaction","233880794_Barriers_to_Faculty_Pedagogical_Change_Lack_of_Training_Time_Incentives_and_Tensions_with_Professional_Identity","233145814_Factors_affecting_students'_satisfaction_in_engineering_disciplines_traditional_vs_blended_approaches","228872057_How_Does_Technology-Enabled_Active_Learning_Affect_Undergraduate_Students'_Understanding_of_Electromagnetism_Concepts","228640855_Student-centered_activities_for_large_enrollment_undergraduate_programs_SCALE-_UP","222863721_Blended_Learning_Uncovering_Its_Transformative_Potential_in_Higher_Education","51187214_Increased_Structure_and_Active_Learning_Reduce_the_Achievement_Gap_in_Introductory_Biology","23719556_A_multi-method_study_to_determine_the_effectiveness_of_and_student_attitudes_to_online_instructional_videos_for_teaching_clinical_nursing_skills","303198060_Review_of_literature_blended_learning_Using_ALN_to_change_the_classroom_-Will_it_work","288966981_Studying_Learning_Spaces_A_Review_of_Selected_Empirical_Studies","286792735_The_Effectiveness_of_Online_and_Blended_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Empirical_Literature","284689878_Tech_flex","284685723_AAHE_Bulletin","258795268_Does_Space_Matter_Impact_of_Classroom_Space_on_Student_Learning_in_an_Organic-First_Curriculum","232175343_How_learning_in_an_inverted_classroom_influences_cooperation_innovation_and_task_orientation","231268035_Effectiveness_of_Facilitating_Small-Group_Learning_in_Large_Lecture_Classes","227781728_Space_Matters_The_Impact_of_Formal_Learning_Environments_on_Student_Learning","51120960_Improved_Learning_in_a_Large-Enrollment_Physics_Class","44840198_Evaluation_of_Evidence-Based_Practices_in_Online_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Review_of_Online_Learning_Studies","23716370_Farewell_Lecture"]}
