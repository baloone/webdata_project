{"id":"304814412_Towards_a_Middle-out_Approach_for_Building_Legal_Domain_Reference_Ontology","abstract":"This article presents a middle-out approach to build legal domain reference ontology for a Legal Knowledge Based System (LKBS). The proposed approach is a combination of top-down and bottom-up strategies. In particular, we propose to develop legal domain reference ontology, splitted into modules or fragments, based on merging two processes: Conceptual Modeling Process, by reusing foundational ontologies (top-down strategy) and Ontology Learning Process from textual resources (bottom-up strategy).","authors":["MIRNA EL GHOSH","H.
