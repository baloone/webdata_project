{"id":"311982961_Construction_of_a_Benchmark_for_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ","abstract":"Questionnaires are a cheap and highly efficient tool for achieving a quantitative measure of a product’s user experience (UX). However, it is not always easy to decide, if a questionnaire result can really show whether a product satisfies this quality aspect. So a benchmark is useful. It allows comparing the results of one product to a large set of other products. In this paper we describe a benchmark for the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), a widely used evaluation tool for interactive products. We also describe how the benchmark can be applied to the quality assurance process for concrete projects.","authors":["Martin Schrepp","Andreas Hinderks","Jörg Thomaschewski"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence 4(Regular Issue):40-44","DOI:10.9781/ijimai.2017.445"],"references":["319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","265784386_Applying_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ_in_Different_Evaluation_Scenarios","236522546_Konstruktion_eines_Fragebogens_zur_Messung_der_User_Experience_von_Softwareprodukten","235850976_Efficient_Measurement_of_the_User_Experience_of_Interactive_Products_How_to_use_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ_Example_Spanish_Language_Version","233864442_The_Effect_of_Perceived_Hedonic_Quality_on_Product_Appealingness","229675848_SUMI_the_Software_Usability_Measurement_Inventory","228593520_SUS_A_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","273947524_Interaction_Design_Beyond_Human-Computer_Interaction","269200997_Enhancing_the_Explanatory_Power_of_Usability_Heuristics","238122690_Heuristic_Evaluation_In_Usability_Inspection_Methods"]}
