{"id":"323327967_Bricklayer_Elementary_Students_Learn_Math_through_Programming_and_Art","abstract":"As computer science becomes more prevalent in the K-12 world, elementary schools are increasingly adopting computing curricula. Computer scientists have recognized the connection between math and computer science, but little work has demonstrated how and whether computer science can support improved learning in math. This paper reports on a project in which elementary students in a gifted program used Bricklayer, a functional programming environment that supports artistic and mathematical expression. A pre- and post-test design demonstrates significant learning gains in coordinate graphing and visual-spatial skills.","authors":["Michelle Friend","Michael Matthews","Victor L.
