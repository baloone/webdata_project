{"id":"327895467_Symmetric_Cryptography_System_for_Teaching_Modular_Inverse_Matrices","abstract":"This article describes the teaching of modular inverse matrices with the symmetric cryptographic algorithm Hill Cipher and its implementation on mobile devices with Android Operative System. The decryption in the Hill Cipher algorithm involves the calculus of modular inverse matrices. The goal of this paper is the teaching of modular inverse matrix calculation to undergraduate students of Computer Sciences through the decryption in symmetric cryptography. An experiment was conducted on two groups of students, the control and the experimental groups. To measure student learning, a test was applied to both groups. Comparison of control and experimental groups results show an increase in student performance for the calculation of modular inverse matrices.","authors":["Fausto Abraham Jacques-García","Sandra Luz Canchola-Magdaleno","Gloria Nélida Avecilla-Ramírez"],"meta":["December 2016","Project: Visual Cryptography Educational System"],"references":["267337349_A_Review_of_Research_on_Mobile_Learning_in_Teacher_Education","227209617_Mathematical_Epistemology_from_a_Peircean_Semiotic_Point_of_View","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","240956469_Motivating_the_concept_of_eigenvectors_via_cryptography","224143893_How_to_teach_undergraduate_students_a_real_cipher_design"]}
