{"id":"226427912_Constraint_satisfaction_techniques_in_planning_and_scheduling","abstract":"Over the last few years constraint satisfaction, planning, and scheduling have received increased attention, and substantial\neffort has been invested in exploiting constraint satisfaction techniques when solving real life planning and scheduling problems.\nConstraint satisfaction is the process of finding a solution to a set of constraints. Planning is the process of finding a\nsequence of actions that transfer the world from some initial state to a desired state. Scheduling is the problem of assigning\na set of tasks to a set of resources subject to a set of constraints. In this paper, we introduce the main definitions and\ntechniques of constraint satisfaction, planning and scheduling from the Artificial Intelligence point of view.","authors":["Roman Bart√°k","Miguel A.
