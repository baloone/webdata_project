{"id":"266253006_Enhancing_Student_Engagement_Using_the_Flipped_Classroom","abstract":"The flipped classroom is an innovative pedagogical approach that focuses on learner-centered instruction. The purposes of this report were to illustrate how to implement the flipped classroom and to describe students' perceptions of this approach within 2 undergraduate nutrition courses. The template provided enables faculty to design before, during, and after class activities and assessments based on objectives using all levels of Bloom's taxonomy. The majority of the 142 students completing the evaluation preferred the flipped method compared with traditional pedagogical strategies. The process described in the report was successful for both faculty and students.","authors":["Mary Beth Gilboy","Scott Heinerichs","Gina Pazzaglia"],"meta":["September 2014Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior 47(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jneb.2014.08.008","SourcePubMed"],"references":["270820426_Making_Sense_of_Cronbach's_Alpha","235786490_Redesign_of_a_Large_Lecture_Course_Into_a_Small-Group_Learning_Course","286993943_Evidence_on_flipped_classrooms_is_still_coming_in","279703986_The_reading_skills_digital_brains_need","258854250_The_Flipped_Classroom_A_Course_Redesign_to_Foster_Learning_and_Engagement_in_a_Health_Professions_School","258641079_PBL_and_Beyond_Trends_in_Collaborative_Learning","256085206_Using_the_Flipped_Classroom_in_Graduate_Nursing_Education","246255758_From_Sage_on_the_Stage_to_Guide_on_the_Side","242400296_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_An_Overview","234012276_Vodcasts_and_Active-Learning_Exercises_in_a_Flipped_Classroom_Model_of_a_Renal_Pharmacotherapy_Module","233265183_Two_Studies_of_Reading_Compliance_Among_College_Students","233044676_Some_Observations_on_the_Efficiency_of_Lecturing","229546957_Teaching_Methods_in_Higher_Education-Innovation_and_Research","224886971_Lecture_Halls_without_Lectures_-_A_Proposal_for_Medical_Education","224088630_Flipping_the_Work_Design_in_an_industrial_engineering_course","45138153_Is_Traditional_Teaching_Really_All_That_Bad_A_Within-Student_Between-Subject_Approach"]}
