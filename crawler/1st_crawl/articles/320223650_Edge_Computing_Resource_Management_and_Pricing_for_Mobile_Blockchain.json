{"id":"320223650_Edge_Computing_Resource_Management_and_Pricing_for_Mobile_Blockchain","abstract":"The mining process in blockchain requires solving a proof-of-work puzzle, which is resource expensive to implement in mobile devices due to the high computing power and energy needed. In this paper, we, for the first time, consider edge computing as an enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we study edge computing resource management and pricing to support mobile blockchain applications in which the mining process of miners can be offloaded to an edge computing service provider. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the edge computing service provider and the individual utilities of the miners. In the first stage, the service provider sets the price of edge computing nodes. In the second stage, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For the uniform pricing where the same price is applied to all miners, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For the discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied to different miners, the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved to exist and be unique by capitalizing on the Variational Inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model.","authors":["Zehui Xiong","Shaohan Feng","Dusit Niyato","Ping Wang"],"meta":["October 2017","Project: Optimization on Blockchain Applications"],"references":["318018529_Blockchain_Based_Access_Control","314266057_A_tutorial_on_blockchain_and_applications_to_secure_network_control-planes","314213263_Comparing_Blockchain_and_Cloud_Services_for_Business_Process_Execution","309097688_Security_and_Privacy_in_Decentralized_Energy_Trading_Through_Multi-Signatures_Blockchain_and_Anonymous_Messaging_Streams","282351734_Offloading_in_Software_Defined_Network_at_Edge_with_Information_Asymmetry_A_Contract_Theoretical_Approach","261434466_Information_propagation_in_the_Bitcoin_network","224131020_Convex_Optimization_Game_Theory_and_Variational_Inequality_Theory","24048549_The_Nash_Bargaining_Solution_in_Economic_Modeling","325920743_Performance_Analysis_and_Application_of_Mobile_Blockchain","319610136_A_Model_for_Collaborative_Blockchain-Based_Video_Delivery_Relying_on_Advanced_Network_Services_Chains","318577392_FruitChains_A_Fair_Blockchain","317423459_Blockchain-enabled_spectrum_access_in_cognitive_radio_networks","317356750_A_Survey_on_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_of_Bitcoin","317245201_Enabling_Localized_Peer-to-Peer_Electricity_Trading_Among_Plug-in_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles_Using_Consortium_Blockchains","314948539_Socially_Optimal_Mining_Pools","313040623_The_evolution_of_strategies_in_the_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma","308868578_On_Power_Splitting_Games_in_Distributed_Computation_The_Case_of_Bitcoin_Pooled_Mining","305525038_Blockchain_Mining_Games","305343240_Group_bargaining_based_bitcoin_mining_scheme_using_incentive_payment_process_Group_bargaining_based_bitcoin_mining_scheme_using_incentive_payment_process","302919497_Blockchains_and_Smart_Contracts_for_the_Internet_of_Things","296684539_Bitcoin_and_Beyond_A_Technical_Survey_on_Decentralized_Digital_Currencies","285618274_Exploring_Miner_Evolution_in_Bitcoin_Network","280036414_Bitcoin_Mining_Pools_A_Cooperative_Game_Theoretic_Analysis","272244412_The_Economics_of_Bitcoin_Transaction_Fees","51966884_Analysis_of_Bitcoin_Pooled_Mining_Reward_Systems","24049033_Network_Competition_II_Price_Discrimination"]}
