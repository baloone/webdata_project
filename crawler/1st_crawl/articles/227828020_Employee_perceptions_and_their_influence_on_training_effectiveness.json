{"id":"227828020_Employee_perceptions_and_their_influence_on_training_effectiveness","abstract":"Studies of the benefits of human resource development (HRD) for organisations have assumed a direct connection between training strategy and a hierarchy of performance outcomes: learning, behavioural change and performance improvement. The influence of workplace practices and employees' experiences on training effectiveness has received little attention. This study investigates evaluation strategies designed to elicit greater training effectiveness, and explores the influence of trainees' perceptions and work environment factors on this. Drawing on detailed case study findings, the authors highlight the importance of management practices, trainees' perceptions of the work environment and systems of reward in explaining behaviour change after training.","authors":["Amalia Santos","Mark Stuart"],"meta":["August 2006Human Resource Management Journal 13(1):27 - 45","DOI:10.1111/j.1748-8583.2003.tb00082.x","Project: MA HRM"],"references":["271675462_Trainees'_Attributes_and_Attitudes_Neglected_Influences_on_Training_Effectiveness","313047248_Organizational_training_and_signals_of_importance_Linking_pretraining_perceptions_to_intentions_to_transfer","270235339_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_training_WIL_supervisors","253238215_The_Realities_of_Human_Resource_Management_Managing_the_Employment_Relationship","245907445_Developing_and_Training_Human_Resources_in_Organization","240239837_On_the_Political_Economy_of_Skill_in_the_Advanced_Industrial_Nations","239028885_Training_in_Organizations_Needs_Assessment","235301899_Placing_Symbols_before_Reality_Re-evaluating_the_Low_Skills_Equilibrium","235288844_Evaluation_of_Management_Development_A_Case_Study","234636841_Benchmarking_the_Best"]}
