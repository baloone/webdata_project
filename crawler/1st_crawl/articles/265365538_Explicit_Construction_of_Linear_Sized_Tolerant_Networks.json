{"id":"265365538_Explicit_Construction_of_Linear_Sized_Tolerant_Networks","abstract":"For every ϵ > 0 and every integer m > 0, we construct explicitly graphs with O(m/ϵ) vertices and maximum degree , such that after removing any (1 − ϵ) portion of their vertices or edges, the remaining graph still contains a path of length m. This settles a problem of Rosenberg, which was motivated by the study of fault torerant linear arrays.","authors":["Noga Alon","F.R.K.
