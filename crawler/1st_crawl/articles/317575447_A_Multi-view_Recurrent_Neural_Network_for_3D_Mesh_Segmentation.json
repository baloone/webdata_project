{"id":"317575447_A_Multi-view_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_3D_Mesh_Segmentation","abstract":"This paper introduces a multi-view recurrent neural netowrk (MV-RNN) approach for 3D mesh segmentation. Our architecture combines the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a two-layer long short term memory (LSTM) to yield coherent segmentation of 3D shapes. The imaged-based CNN are useful for effectively generating the edge probability feature map while the LSTM correlates these edge maps across different views and output a well-defined per-view edge image. Evaluations on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark dataset show that our framework significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Truc Le","Giang Bui","Ye Duan"],"meta":["June 2017Computers & Graphics 66","DOI:10.1016/j.cag.2017.05.011"],"references":["319770438_Long-Term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition_and_Description","307781717_LSTM-CF_Unifying_Context_Modeling_and_Fusion_with_LSTMs_for_RGB-D_Scene_Labeling","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","264160686_Learning_Rich_Features_from_RGB-D_Images_for_Object_Detection_and_Segmentation","240308781_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Scene_Labeling","220720898_Topology_matching_for_fully_automatic_similarity_estimation_of_3D_shapes","220183813_Modeling_by_Example","220183739_Least_Squares_Conformal_Maps_for_Automatic_Texture_Atlas_Generation","220068318_Hierarchical_mesh_segmentation_based_on_fitting_primitives","220068106_Fast_and_Intuitive_Generation_of_Geometric_Shape_Transitions","220068028_Consistent_mesh_partitioning_and_skeletonisation_using_the_shape_diameter_function","27651394_Fast_Mesh_Segmentation_using_Random_Walks","27521289_Feature-Based_Surface_Parameterization_and_Texture_Mapping","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","4015913_An_overview_on_properties_and_efficacy_of_topological_skeletons_in_Shape_Modelling","3303030_LSTM_recurrent_networks_learn_simple_context-free_and_context-sensitive_languages","309957302_3D_attention-driven_depth_acquisition_for_object_identification","308277589_3D-R2N2_A_Unified_Approach_for_Single_and_Multi-view_3D_Object_Reconstruction","305346624_Efficient_inference_in_fully_connected_crfs_with_gaussian_edge_potentials_In_Advances_in_neural_information_processing_systems_24_25th_annual_conference_on_neural_information_processing_systems_2011_P","295401026_Unsupervised_3D_shape_segmentation_and_co-segmentation_via_deep_learning","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","282940870_Projective_Feature_Learning_for_3D_Shapes_with_Multi-View_Depth_Images","271141076_A_comprehensive_overview_of_methodologies_and_performance_evaluation_frameworks_in_3D_mesh_segmentation","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos","262208113_Short_Communication_to_SMI_2011_CAD_mesh_model_segmentation_by_clustering","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","227720802_Heat_Walk_Robust_Salient_Segmentation_of_Non-rigid_Shapes","222682036_Polyhedral_surface_decomposition_with_applications","222580550_Surface_mesh_segmentation_and_smooth_surface_extraction_through_region_growing","222298537_A_New_CAD_Mesh_Segmentation_Method_Based_on_Curvature_Tensor_Analysis","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","220507271_Metamorphosis_of_Polyhedral_Surfaces_using_Decomposition","220506679_A_survey_on_Mesh_Segmentation_Techniques","220184554_Line_Drawings_from_Volume_Data","220183948_Suggestive_Contours_for_Conveying_Shape","47861451_Ridge-valley_lines_on_meshes_via_implicit_surface_fitting","4206157_Feature_Sensitive_Mesh_Segmentation_with_Mean_Shift","3194431_Three-Dimensional_Surface_Mesh_Segmentation_Using_Curvedness-Based_Region_Growing_Approach","2482290_Hierarchical_mesh_decomposition_using_fuzzy_clustering_and_cuts"]}
