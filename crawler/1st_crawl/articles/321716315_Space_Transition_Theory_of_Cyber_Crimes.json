{"id":"321716315_Space_Transition_Theory_of_Cyber_Crimes","abstract":"Some researchers have tried to explain cyber crimes with traditional theories such as social learning theory (Skinner and Fream 1997; Rogers 1999, 2001), Kohlberg’s moral development theory and differential reinforcement theory (Rogers 2001), Cohen’s strain theory (O’Connor 2003), deindividuation theory (Demetriou and Silke 2003), Gottfredson and Hirschi’s general theory of crime (Foster 2004), routine activities theory (Adamski 1998; McKenzie 2000; Grabosky 2001; Pease 2001; Yar 2005a) and multiple theories (McQuade\n2005; Taylor et al. 2005; Walker, Brock, and Stuart 2006). However, those theoretical justifications have proved to be inadequate as an overall explanation for the phenomenon of cybercrimes. To fill the gap in explaining cyber crimes, the space transition theory has been developed. This theory is presented and discussed in this chapter.","authors":["Jaishankar Karuppannan"],"meta":["January 2008","In book: Crimes of the Internet (pp.283-301)Chapter: Space Transition Theory of Cyber CrimesPublisher: PearsonEditors: Frank Schmalleger, Michael Pittaro"],"references":["316860618_Commemorating_a_Decade_in_Existence_of_the_International_Journal_of_Cyber_Criminology_A_Research_Agenda_to_Advance_the_Scholarship_on_Cyber_Crime","37366481_The_Psychology_of_Cyberspace","31091045_A_Criminological_Internet_'Sting'_Experimental_Evidence_of_Illegal_and_Deviant_Visits_to_a_Website_Trap","5089515_Social_Status_and_Crime","344776679_Cybercrime_in_Progress_Theory_and_prevention_of_technology-enabled_offenses","285588284_Cyberciminology_and_Digital_Investigation","282955618_Out_of_the_Beta_Phase_Obstacles_Challenges_and_Promising_Paths_in_the_Study_of_Cyber_Criminology","268347417_An_exploration_of_student_teachers'_interaction_with_on-line_activities_and_their_influence_on_their_teaching_topics_such_as_netiquette_and_cyber-bullying_an_Australian_and_Chinese_study"]}
