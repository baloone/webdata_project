In this paper, we propose an effective method to efficiently operate cyber ISR using machine learning, especially utilizing incremental learning methods. We compare two learning methods that are suitable for use in the self-learning agent model of self-survival in a closed network. The result shows that the incremental learning method reduces the memory needed by more than 20%, with an accuracy of more than 82%.\nThus, the incremental learning method can be very effective in a closed military network.","authors":["Gyeongil Shin","Hosang Yooun","Dongil Shin","Dongkyoo Shin"],"meta":["October 2018Soft Computing 22(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-018-3433-1"],"references":["317829095_A_novel_lightweight_URL_phishing_detection_system_using_SVM_and_similarity_index","313600439_Analysis_of_KDD_'99_Intrusion_Detection_Dataset_for_Selection_of_Relevance_Features","309793324_Evaluation_of_a_channel_assignment_scheme_in_mobile_network_systems","293096796_Learning_to_Prevent_Inactive_Student_of_Indonesia_Open_University","319485531_Weighted_Local_Naive_Bayes_Link_Prediction","313745907_Experiments_with_a_new_boosting_algorithm_machine_learning","311611463_hi-RF_Incremental_Learning_Random_Forest_for_Large-Scale_Multi-class_Data_Classification","309530605_Two_Machine_Learning_Models_for_Mobile_Phone_Battery_Discharge_Rate_Prediction_Based_on_Usage_Patterns","307541116_hi-RF_Incremental_Learning_Random_Forest_for_large-scale_multi-class_Data_Classification","296862084_Incremental_learning_of_human_activity_models_from_videos","267637484_Computationally_Efficient_Rule-Based_Classification_for_Continuous_Streaming_Data","262287657_Batch-Incremental_versus_Instance-Incremental_Learning_in_Dynamic_and_Evolving_Data","236970938_A_Very_Fast_Decision_Tree_Algorithm_for_Real-Time_Data_Mining_of_Imperfect_Data_Streams_in_a_Distributed_Wireless_Sensor_Network","285346806_Methods_for_Incremental_Learning_A_Survey","261154095_Cyber_military_strategy_for_cyberspace_superiority_in_cyber_warfare"]}
