{"id":"292211193_Modeling_of_Slurry-Phase_Reactors_for_Hydrocracking_of_Heavy_Oils","abstract":"The modeling of slurry-phase reactors for petroleum hydrocracking has been reviewed and classified according to the flow regime of the gas phase as models of pseudo-homogeneous bubble flow regime and heterogeneous bubble flow regime. It is anticipated that depending on the fluid properties and operating conditions, a type of model can show superiority for representing the reactor behavior in comparison with the other. It was also found that the usual industrial configuration for slurry-phase reactors are slurry bubble column reactors in which axial dispersion models are the most common formulation. A generalized reactor model, which considers all mass and heat transfer phenomena, is proposed based on the literature, and details are provided to estimate all the model parameters. For slurry-phase hydrocracking systems it becomes evident the lack of experimental information needed for validation and the necessity of exploring different types of models, as axial dispersion models under different bubble flow regimes as well as a deeply study of the transitory state.","authors":["Cristian Calderon","Jorge Ancheyta"],"meta":["January 2016Energy & Fuels 30(4)","DOI:10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b02807"],"references":["277027589_Bubble_column_reactors_for_high_pressures_and_high_temperatures_operation","276497815_Bubble_and_Heat_Transfer_Phenomena_in_Viscous_Slurry_Bubble_Column","345308815_Modeling_of_Processes_and_Reactors_for_Upgrading_of_Heavy_Petroleum","292433769_Review_Bubble_column_reactors","289653674_A_numerical_method_for_bubbly_flow_simulation_based_on_a_multi-fluid_model","282768515_Axial_Mixing_in_Multiphase_Contactors_-_A_Unified_Correlation","280697142_Variation_of_Gas_Holdup_in_Bubble_Columns_With_Physical_Properties_of_Liquids_and_Operating_Parameters_of_Columns","277450809_A_Numerical_Method_for_Bubbly_Flow_Simulation_Based_on_a_Multi-Fluid_Model","277339165_Mathematical_Modeling_of_a_Slurry_Bubble_Column_Reactor_for_Hydrodesulfurization_of_Diesel_Fuel_Single-_and_Two-Bubble_Configurations","273284725_A_review_of_recent_advances_in_catalytic_hydrocracking_of_heavy_residues"]}
