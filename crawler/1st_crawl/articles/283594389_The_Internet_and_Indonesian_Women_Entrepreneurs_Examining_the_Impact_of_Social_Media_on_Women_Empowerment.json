{"id":"283594389_The_Internet_and_Indonesian_Women_Entrepreneurs_Examining_the_Impact_of_Social_Media_on_Women_Empowerment","abstract":"Unemployment is one of the major challenges that Indonesia faces. Home to over 230 million, Indonesia has an unemployment rate of 2.6% among a labour force of 107.7 million (Badan Pusat Statistik 2010). Of this number, the working population is pegged at 104.9 million, comprising 66.8 million men and 38.1 million women (ibid.). The unemployment rate appears to be moderate. However, the Indonesian Statistics Bureau estimates that only 67.72% of the working force is regularly employed. Therefore, the actual unemployment rate at any given time is higher than the official figure.","authors":["Ezmieralda Melissa","Anis Hamidati","Muninggar Sri Saraswati","Alexander G.
