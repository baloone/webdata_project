{"id":"317722225_SIMULATION_APPLIED_TO_URBAN_LOGISTICS_A_STATE_OF_THE_ART","abstract":"This work provides a review of simulation techniques applied to urban logistics with a focus on practical applications. Several techniques and tools have been proposed to simulate different systems in urban logistics. In most cases, simulation choices depend on the objective of the simulation, the role of the decision maker and the type of problem. The paper offers a state of the art in which we analyse the existing simulation solutions for a given problem and/or a given stakeholder. As a result, it offers a practical reference for urban logistics researchers and practitioners who wish to use simulation in order to study the behaviour and performance of their systems. We propose an analytical framework allowing an easy overview of advantages and drawbacks of each technique, output criteria and examples.","authors":["Jlassi Sarra","Simon Tamayo Giraldo","Arthur
