{"id":"257051022_On_palindromic_factorization_of_words","abstract":"Given a finite word u, we define its palindromic length|u|pal|u|pal to be the least number n such that u=v1v2…vnu=v1v2…vn with each vivi a palindrome. We address the following open question: let P be a positive integer and w an infinite word such that |u|pal⩽P|u|pal⩽P for every factor u of w. Must w be ultimately periodic? We give a partial answer to this question by proving that for each positive integer k, the word w must contain a k-power, i.e., a factor of the form ukuk. In particular, w cannot be a fixed point of a primitive morphism. We also prove more: for each pair of positive integers k and l, the word w must contain a position covered by at least l distinct k-powers. In particular, w cannot be a Sierpinski-like word.","authors":["A. E. Frid","Svetlana Puzynina","Luca Q.
