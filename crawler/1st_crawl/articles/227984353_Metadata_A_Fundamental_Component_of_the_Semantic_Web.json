{"id":"227984353_Metadata_A_Fundamental_Component_of_the_Semantic_Web","abstract":"The metadata world hosts a range of systems to which the label of \"metadata vocabulary\" is applied. These vocabularies range from basic descriptive metadata systems, with limited or single-focused functionalities, to more complex \"member/class\" semantic vocabularies. An example of a simple ontology is the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Elements and Element Refinements (www.dublincore.org/usage/terms/dc/current-elements/), a metadata schema developed mainly to facilitate resource discovery. A more complex metadata vocabulary to which the word ontology is applied is the Ariadne Genomics ontology (www.ariadnegenomics.com/technology/ontology.html ). This ontology is used to formalize data on cell proteins for computer analysis: the ontology defines the various proteins, classifies them into taxonomic trees and defines the semantic relationships among them. While many metadata vocabularies in operation were not necessarily created with the Semantic Web in mind, they may be able to play a significant role in its development. For existing and developing ontologies to be used and function fully in the Semantic Web environment, they need to adhere to standards supported by enabling technologies.","authors":["Stuart Sutton","D.
