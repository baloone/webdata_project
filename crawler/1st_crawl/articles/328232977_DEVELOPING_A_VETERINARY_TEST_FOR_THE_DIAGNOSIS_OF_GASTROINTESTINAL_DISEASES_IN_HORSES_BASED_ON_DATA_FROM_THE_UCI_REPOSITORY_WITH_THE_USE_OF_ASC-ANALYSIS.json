A detailed numerical example of the solution demonstrating the technology of creating a veterinary diagnostic test of gastrointestinal diseases of horses is given. As the source data, we use data from the UCI repository, kindly given by Mary McLeish and Matt Cecile (Department of computer science of University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1, with the sup-port of a sponsor: Will Taylor. The developed test is used to solve the problems of diagnosis, decision sup-port and examining the simulated subject area by studying its model. The results of the study can be used by anyone, due to the fact that Eidos the universal automated system, which is a tool of ask-analysis, is in full open free access on the author's website at: http://lc.kubagro.ru/aidos/_Aidos-X.htm, and numeri-cal examples of solving veterinary problems with the use of artificial intelligence technologies are placed as a cloud Eidos-application 129","authors":["Eugene Veniaminovich Lutsenko"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.21515/1990-4665-141-033","Project: INTELLIGENT SCALABLE OPEN INTERACTIVE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCHING ON THE BASIS OF ASC-ANALYSIS AND \"EIDOS\" SYSTEM"],"references":[]}
