Mixed-initiative systems entailing shared decision-making between humans and intelligent software are a promising strategy that combines the advantages of human insight and autonomous control. This report discusses empirical results related to shared decision-making in the context of military applications including outcomes from research on intelligent agents, control of multiple unmanned systems, trust and transparency, cognitive architectures, natural language processing, and bi-directional interfaces. Overall, mixed-initiative systems show great promise, but more research will be required before such systems become part of large-scale operational environments. Effects of emotional response to autonomous systems, ethical software constraints, and machine learning transparency are identified as future research opportunities.","authors":["Michael Barnes","Jessie Y.
