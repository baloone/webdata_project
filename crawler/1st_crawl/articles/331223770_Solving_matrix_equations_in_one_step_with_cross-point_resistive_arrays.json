{"id":"331223770_Solving_matrix_equations_in_one_step_with_cross-point_resistive_arrays","abstract":"Conventional digital computers can execute advanced operations by a sequence of elementary Boolean functions of 2 or more bits. As a result, complicated tasks such as solving a linear system or solving a differential equation require a large number of computing steps and an extensive use of memory units to store individual bits. To accelerate the execution of such advanced tasks, in-memory computing with resistive memories provides a promising avenue, thanks to analog data storage and physical computation in the memory. Here, we show that a cross-point array of resistive memory devices can directly solve a system of linear equations, or find the matrix eigenvectors. These operations are completed in just one single step, thanks to the physical computing with Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, and thanks to the negative feedback connection in the cross-point circuit. Algebraic problems are demonstrated in hardware and applied to classical computing tasks, such as ranking webpages and solving the Schrödinger equation in one step.","authors":["Zhong Sun","Giacomo Pedretti","Elia Ambrosi","Alessandro Bricalli"],"meta":["February 2019Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116(10)","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1815682116","Project: LoopUS - LOOP compUting Systems"],"references":["326869517_Logic_Computing_with_Stateful_Neural_Networks_of_Resistive_Switches","324444981_Mixed-precision_in-memory_computing","322334492_Brain-inspired_computing_with_resistive_switching_memory_RRAM_Devices_synapses_and_neural_networks","321492168_Analogue_signal_and_image_processing_with_large_memristor_crossbars","318457488_Memristive_neural_network_for_on-line_learning_and_tracking_with_brain-inspired_spike_timing_dependent_plasticity","325744081_In-memory_computing_with_resistive_switching_devices","324117895_Optimizing_Incremental_Step_Pulse_Programming_for_RRAM_Through_Device-Circuit_Co-Design","317084030_The_PageRank_citation_ranking_Bringing_order_to_the_Web_Technical_report","317078153_Sparse_coding_with_memristor_networks","315454606_Solving_Systems_of_Linear_Equations_with_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Processor","303291282_Resistive_switching_memories_based_on_metal_oxides_Mechanisms_reliability_and_scaling","313157978_The_chips_are_down_for_Moore's_law","309143139_Evaluation_of_an_Analog_Accelerator_for_Linear_Algebra","306202698_Experimental_demonstration_and_tolerancing_of_a_large-scale_neural_network_165_000_synapses_using_phase-change_memory_as_the_synaptic_weight_element","303542726_Dot-product_engine_for_neuromorphic_computing_programming_1T1M_crossbar_to_accelerate_matrix-vector_multiplication"]}
