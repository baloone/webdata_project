{"id":"233530332_ZenCrowd_Leveraging_Probabilistic_Reasoning_and_Crowdsourcing_Techniques_for_Large-Scale_Entity_Linking","abstract":"We tackle the problem of entity linking for large collections of online pages; Our system, ZenCrowd, identifies entities from natural language text using state of the art techniques and automatically connects them to the Linked Open Data cloud. We show how one can take advantage of human intelligence to improve the quality of the links by dynamically generating micro-tasks on an online crowdsourcing platform. We develop a probabilistic framework to make sensible decisions about candidate links and to identify unreliable human workers. We evaluate ZenCrowd in a real deployment and show how a combination of both probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing techniques can significantly improve the quality of the links, while limiting the amount of work performed by the crowd.","authors":["Gianluca Demartini","Djellel Difallah","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.1145/2187836.2187900","Conference: Proceedings of the 21st World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2012, Lyon, France"],"references":["234791954_Annotating_Named_Entities_in_Twitter_Data_with_Crowdsourcing","228057515_Human_Powered_Sorts_and_Joins","221519989_Boilerplate_Detection_Using_Shallow_Text_Features","221466941_Effective_and_Efficient_Entity_Search_in_RDF_Data","221466256_dipLODocusRDF-Short_and_Long-Tail_RDF_Analytics_for_Massive_Webs_of_Data","313192564_Design_and_implementation_of_relevance_assessments_using_crowdsourcing","301851512_Human-powered_Sorts_and_Joins","284980661_In_search_of_quality_in_crowdsourcing_for_search_engine_evaluation","239563023_Advances_in_Record-Linkage_Methodology_as_Applied_to_Matching_the_1985_Census_of_Tampa_Florida","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm"]}
