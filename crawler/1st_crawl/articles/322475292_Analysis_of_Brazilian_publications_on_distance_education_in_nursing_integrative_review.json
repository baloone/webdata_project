{"id":"322475292_Analysis_of_Brazilian_publications_on_distance_education_in_nursing_integrative_review","abstract":"Objective: \nTo analyze the publications that focus on distance education in nursing in Brazil from 2010 to 2016.\n\nMethod: \nIntegrative review of the literature with data collection in June 2016 in the following databases: LILACS, MEDLINE via PUBMED, CINAHL and SCOPUS. For the data analysis and interpretation, the thematic categorization was chosen.\n\nResults: \nWe selected 18 articles for discussion, whose textual analysis permitted the construction of three thematic categories: use of virtual technologies for distance education in nursing; construction of virtual learning environments with the aid of virtual technologies for distance education in nursing; and evaluation of the learning process through virtual technologies for distance education of nurses.\n\nConclusion: \nDistance Education stands out as an effective teaching-learning strategy in this type of education in Brazilian nursing, focused mainly on the improvement and complement of traditional teaching.","authors":["Ana Paula Cardoso Tavares","Bruna Silva Leite","Isabelle Andrade Silveira","Thayane Dias Dos Santos"],"meta":["February 2018Revista Brasileira de Enfermagem 71(1):214-222","DOI:10.1590/0034-7167-2016-0454"],"references":["314453505_Moodle-folio_para_o_ensino_em_saude_e_enfermagem_avaliacao_do_processo_educacional","297625757_Estudo_sobre_o_Uso_do_Moodle_em_Cursos_de_Especializacao_a_Distancia_da_Unifesp","279307843_Distance_education_in_neonatal_nursing_scenarios_A_systematic_review","275722476_Limites_e_possibilidades_do_ensino_a_distancia_EaD_na_educacao_permanente_em_saude_revisao_integrativa","274090172_The_contribution_of_distance_learning_to_the_knowledge_of_nursing_lecturers_regarding_assessment_of_chronic_wounds","269166597_Revisoes_sistematicas_da_literatura_passos_para_sua_elaboracao","262428813_Competencies_developed_in_a_nursing_management_distance_learning_specialization_course","295570595_Autonomy_in_Nursing_Students'_Process_of_Knowledge_Construction_The_Educational_Chat_as_a_Teaching_Tool_vol_18_pg_210_2010","289736173_Construction_and_validation_of_a_virtual_educational_module_for_topical_treatment_of_chronic_wounds","280766684_Construction_of_virtual_learning_objects_for_teaching_the_history_of_nursing"]}
