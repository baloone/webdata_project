{"id":"345253375_Sample_Based_Synthesis_of_Car_Engine_Noise","abstract":"A recent trend in electric cars introduces new problem due to their silent movement. Electric cars are much quieter than conventional cars equipped with internal combustion engines. This lack of noise poses a danger to other road users. To increase the safety of pedestrians, under certain conditions, artificial noise generators must be used, as required by EU regulations. Car engine noise synthesis is proposed that combines sample based synthesis and envelope scaling dependent on engine rotational speed.","authors":["Dubravko MiljkoviÄ‡"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.23919/MIPRO48935.2020.9245323","Conference: MIPROAt: Opatija, Croatia"],"references":["324433298_Artificial_Engine_Sound_Synthesis_Method_for_Modification_of_the_Acoustic_Characteristics_of_Electric_Vehicles","303667584_TSM_Toolbox_MATLAB_Implementations_of_Time-Scale_Modification_Algorithms","235390393_Study_of_the_road_traffic_noise_in_Erzurum-Turkey","233403035_Sample-based_engine_noise_synthesis_using_an_enhanced_pitch-synchronous_overlap-And-Add_method","228992574_Wavetable_Synthesis_101_A_Fundamental_Perspective","322042898_Active_Noise_Control_in_Light_Aircraft_Cabin_Using_Multichannel_Coherent_Method","297702379_Noise_of_Induction_Machines","274734099_Street-level_noise_in_an_urban_setting_Assessment_and_contribution_to_personal_exposure"]}
