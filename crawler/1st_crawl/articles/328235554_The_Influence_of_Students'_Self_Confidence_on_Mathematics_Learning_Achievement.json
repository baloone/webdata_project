{"id":"328235554_The_Influence_of_Students'_Self_Confidence_on_Mathematics_Learning_Achievement","abstract":"The math learning taught in schools has a lot of attention. Many factors also affect the achievement in learning mathematics. Self-confidence is one of the influential factors which is unrecognized regarding students' mathematics achievement. Some studies have been done and showed that students' self-confidence in learning mathematic influenced the mathematics learning achievement. Thus, self-confidence is essentially believed to improve students' achievement in learning mathematics. This research discusses the influence of students' self-confidence on mathematics learning achievement. Quantitative research method was employed as the research framework. The data were taken from 32 students in one class and they were analyzed through regression correlation technique. The results of hypothesis testing show that there is no significant relationship between students 'self-confidence with students' achievement. However, the magnitude of the correlation shows 0.098956, meaning that students' self-confidence contributes 0.98% to the mathematics learning achievement.","authors":["K Kunhertanti","R H Santosa"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1097:012126","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1097/1/012126"],"references":["284395205_A_Study_of_Self_Confidence_in_Relation_to_Achievement_Motivation_of_Ded_Students","261944781_Sex_Differences_in_Performance_Attributions_Self-Efficacy_and_Achievement_in_Mathematics_If_I'm_so_Smart_Why_Don't_I_Know_It"]}
