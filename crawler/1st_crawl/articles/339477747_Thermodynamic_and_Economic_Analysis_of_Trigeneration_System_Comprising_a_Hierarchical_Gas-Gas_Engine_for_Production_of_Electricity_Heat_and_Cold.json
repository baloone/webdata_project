{"id":"339477747_Thermodynamic_and_Economic_Analysis_of_Trigeneration_System_Comprising_a_Hierarchical_Gas-Gas_Engine_for_Production_of_Electricity_Heat_and_Cold","abstract":"This paper presents the results of analysis of energy and economic efficiency of the hierarchical gas-gas engine, with a note that a trigeneration system was analyzed, in which the production of electricity, heat and cold are combined. This solution significantly increases the energy efficiency of the gas and gas system compared to a system without cold production. The analysis includes a system comprising a compressor chiller which is driven by an electric motor in the system, as well as a system applying the mechanical work that is carried out via a rotating shaft of rotor-based machines, i.e., a gas turbine and a turboexpander. The comfort of the regulation of the refrigerating power rather promotes the use of a solution including an electric motor. Analysis contains also a schematic diagram of the system with a absorption chiller, which is driven by low-temperature enthalpy of exhaust gases extracted from a hierarchical gas-gas engine. Application of turboexpander with heat regeneration in the trigeneration system is also analyzed. Based on the multi-variant economic and thermodynamic calculations, the most favorable system variant was determined using, among others, the specific cost of cold production.","authors":["Ryszard Bartnik","Zbigniew Buryn","Anna Hnydiuk-Stefan","Waldemar Skomudek"],"meta":["February 2020Energies 13(4):1006","DOI:10.3390/en13041006"],"references":["338728460_Modeling_of_a_Combined_Cycle_Gas_Turbine_Integrated_with_an_Adsorption_Chiller","337809543_Thermo-Economic_Assessment_of_a_Gas_Microturbine-Absorption_Chiller_Trigeneration_System_under_Different_Compressor_Inlet_Air_Temperatures","336660048_Energetic_Analysis_of_Different_Configurations_of_Power_Plants_Connected_to_Liquid_Chemical_Looping_Gasification","331852085_A_Process_Integration_Method_for_Total_Site_Cooling_Heating_and_Power_Optimisation_with_Trigeneration_Systems","328783612_The_Use_of_Direct_Carbon_Fuel_Cells_in_Compact_Energy_Systems_for_the_Generation_of_Electricity_Heat_and_Cold","338976048_Modeling_and_extensive_analysis_of_the_energy_and_economics_of_cooling_heat_and_power_trigeneration_CCHP_from_textile_wastewater_for_industrial_low-grade_heat_recovery","338782140_A_novel_integrated_solar_gas_turbine_trigeneration_system_for_production_of_power_heat_and_cooling_Thermodynamic-economic-environmental_analysis","336751186_Thermodynamic_and_economic_analysis_of_a_gas_turbine_set_coupled_with_a_turboexpander_in_a_hierarchical_gas-gas_system","336359980_Thermodynamic_and_economic_analysis_of_different_cogeneration_and_trigeneration_systems_based_on_Carbon_dioxide_vapor_compression_refrigeration_systems","334647080_Chemical_looping_technology_in_CHP_combined_heat_and_power_and_CCHPcombined_cooling_heating_and_power_systems_A_critical_review"]}
