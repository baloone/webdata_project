{"id":"2173527_The_Complex_Network_of_Evolutionary_Computation_Authors_an_Initial_Study","abstract":"EC paper authors form a complex network of co-authorship which is, by itself, a example of an evolving system with its own rules, concept of fitness, and patterns of attachment. In this paper we explore the network of authors of evolutionary computation papers found in a major bibliographic database. We examine its macroscopic properties, and compare it with other co-authorship networks; the EC co-authorship network yields results in the same ballpark as other networks, but exhibits some distinctive patterns in terms of internal cohesion. We also try to find some hints on what makes an author a sociometric star. Finally, the role of proceeding editorship as the origin of long-range links in the co-authorship network is studied as well.","authors":["Carlos Cotta","Juan Julián Merelo Guervós"],"meta":["August 2005","SourcearXiv"],"references":["254077910_The_Structure_of_a_Social_Science_Collaboration_Network_Disciplinary_Cohesion_from_1963_to_1999","220879176_Six_degrees_of_Jonathan_Grudin_A_social_network_analysis_of_the_evolution_and_impact_of_CSCW_research","220434530_A_cast_of_thousands_Coauthorship_and_subauthorship_collaboration_in_the_20th_century_as_manifested_in_the_scholarly_journal_literature_of_psychology_and_philosophy","285666280_The_Frequency_Distribution_of_Scientific_Productivity","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","281263059_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaboration","259173905_Social_Network_Analysis","248729836_The_structure_of_a_social_science_collaboration_network","247123838_Kretschmer_H_Patterns_of_behaviour_in_coautorship_networks_of_invisible_colleges_Scientometrics_403_579-591","222546212_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaborations_Physica_A_Statistical_Mechanics_and_its_Applications_3113_590-614"]}
