{"id":"333042570_Vulnerability_of_quantum_classification_to_adversarial_perturbations","abstract":"High-dimensional quantum systems are vital for quantum technologies and are essential in demonstrating practical quantum advantage in quantum computing, simulation and sensing. Since dimen-sionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in high dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space are classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information processing and certain decision problems. However, due to counter-intuitive geometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to adver-sarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this leads to a trade-off between the security of the classification algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages we expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial attacks require extra resources that scale at least polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol. This has wide-ranging implications in the use of both near-term and future quantum technologies for classification. Quantum technologies promise exciting advantages in quantum computation [1], simulation [2], metrology [3] and cryptography [4]. Even while large-scale and fault tolerant quantum technologies currently remain out of reach, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [5] hope to deliver advantages over classical systems in the near-term. Most of these protocols exploit not only unique quantum characteristics like entanglement and superposition, but also high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Without the latter, no sizeable quantum advantages in either computation, simulation or sensing are expected. One important class of tasks where high-dimensional Hilbert spaces may be advantageous are classification problems. To correctly categorise an object belongs to one of the most common and basic questions asked in science. In the quantum setting, classification problems can appear mainly in one of two ways. Firstly, a quantum protocol can be used for classification problems with classical data in order to gain a quantum advantage in speed or precision. Many quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms are of this type [6]. Alternatively, one can classify quantum states or processes themselves, in terms of entanglement [7], phases [8] or other many-body behaviour. Quantum learning protocols also belong to the latter category [9]. From these examples, it therefore appears that advantages for classification tasks will become more pronounced as Hilbert-space dimension grows, at least in the absence of noise. However, as we will see, this is * Electronic address: nana.liu@quantumlah.org no longer true when the classification protocols are subject to adversarial perturbations. These are small, often hard-to-detect perturbations of the object to be classified which give rise to deliberate misclassification. This is highly relevant for many classification problems. In the machine learning context in particular, security breaches in the algorithm are not only desirable for adversarial parties, but also made possible as data used for classification are often shared amongst multiple, possibly un-trusted parties [10]. Recent findings in machine learning suggests that even highly successful classification algorithms can be very vulnerable to adversarial perturbations if the dimension of the data is high enough, such as high-resolution image data [11]. Some quantum machine learning algorithms that resist certain kinds of ad-versarial attacks have also been recently developed [12]. However, it is yet unknown what the fundamental limits to adversarial robustness are for quantum classification problems in general. In this paper, we demonstrate that a perturbation by an amount scaling inversely with the dimension of the quantum system to be classified is sufficient to induce a misclassification. Amazingly, this is a fundamental feature of quantum classification originating from a purely geometrical property of high-dimensional spaces, known as the concentration of measure phenomenon [13]. It is independent of the specifics of any particular classification protocol. Furthermore, detection of these small perturbations by existing efficient certification protocols for quantum systems cannot be efficient. For classification problems, otherwise efficient certification protocols must now require resources scaling polynomially with di-mensionality.
