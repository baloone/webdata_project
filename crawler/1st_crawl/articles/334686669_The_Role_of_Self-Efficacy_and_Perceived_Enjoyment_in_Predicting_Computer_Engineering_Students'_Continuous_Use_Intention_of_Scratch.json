{"id":"334686669_The_Role_of_Self-Efficacy_and_Perceived_Enjoyment_in_Predicting_Computer_Engineering_Students'_Continuous_Use_Intention_of_Scratch","abstract":"Scratch has been implemented as a preliminary programming environment to improve students' programming experience, motivation, and success in the Computer Science (CS) or Engineering departments. Acceptance and use of this visual programming environment by CS or Engineering students is a significant research area. Accordingly, this study investigated acceptance and use of Scratch programming environment by developing a theoretical model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Structural equation modelling approach was used to validate the research model based on data collected from a sample of 186 Computer Engineering students. Results indicated that perceived enjoyment was significantly associated with the perceived usefulness and attitudes. Further, the results suggested that self-efficacy was significantly associated with the ease of use perceptions.","authors":["Ibrahim Arpaci","PÄ±nar Onay Durdu","Alev Mutlu"],"meta":["July 2019International Journal of E-Adoption 11(2):1-12","DOI:10.4018/IJEA.2019070101","Project: Educational Technology"],"references":["311474810_Influence_of_the_familiarization_with_scratch_on_future_teachers'_opinions_and_attitudes_about_programming_and_ICT_in_education","310741044_ICT_Teachers'_Acceptance_of_Scratch_as_Algorithm_Visualization_Software","306362494_An_analysis_of_young_students'_thinking_when_completing_basic_coding_tasks_using_Scratch_Jnr_On_the_iPad_General_thinking_and_computational_work","274632820_USING_SCRATCH_IN_INTRODUCTION_TO_PROGRAMMING_COURSE_FOR_ENGINEERING_STUDENTS","272790646_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","270397806_Closing_the_gender_gap_in_an_introductory_programming_course","234820368_The_Scratch_Programming_Language_and_Environment","234803601_A_CS0_course_using_Scratch","220437004_Social_usage_of_instant_messaging_by_individuals_outside_the_workplace_in_Kuwait_A_structural_equation_model","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","220094594_The_Greenfoot_Programming_Environment","200085965_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_of_Use_and_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","315544703_A_Study_on_the_Effect_affecting_Problem_Solving_Ability_of_Primary_Students_through_the_Scratch_Programming","312361365_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_cloud_computing_adoption_in_education_to_achieve_knowledge_management","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","289585327_Understanding_and_predicting_students'_intention_to_use_mobile_cloud_storage_services","282041757_Impact_of_Perceived_Security_on_Organizational_Adoption_of_Smartphones","278638222_CS_05","277773347_Using_Scratch_as_game-based_learning_tool_to_reduce_learning_anxiety_in_programming_course","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","265266184_An_Enhanced_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_Web-Based_Learning","261201689_A_Scratch-based_CS0_course_for_at-risk_computer_science_majors","259920989_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_5","254220678_Effects_of_indiviuals'_locus_of_control_and_computer_self-efficacy_on_their_e-learning_acceptance_in_high-tech_companies","246494986_Belief_Attitude_Intention_and_Behavior_An_Introduction_to_Theory_and_Research","235362849_A_Diffusion_of_Innovations","230283408_Practices_of_advanced_programming_Tradition_versus_innovation","229665210_Implementation_and_evaluation_of_computer-aided_Mandarin_phonemes_training_system_for_hearing-impaired_students","229514608_Extrinsic_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_to_Use_Computers_in_the_Workplace1","224360883_Scratch_Applications_in_Computer_Science_1","222701943_Extending_the_TAM_for_a_World-Wide-Web_context","222472898_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_in_Internet_usage","221538264_'scratch'_your_way_to_introductory_cs","221368326_A_new_CS0_course_for_at-risk_majors","220259891_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Development_of_a_Measure_and_Initial_Test","220140650_An_assessment_of_the_influence_of_perceived_enjoyment_and_attitude_on_the_intention_to_use_technology_among_pre-service_teachers_A_structural_equation_modeling_approach","220094516_The_Design_of_Alice","19750628_Dimensionality_of_Coping_Factor_Stability_Using_the_Ways_of_Coping_Questionnaire"]}
