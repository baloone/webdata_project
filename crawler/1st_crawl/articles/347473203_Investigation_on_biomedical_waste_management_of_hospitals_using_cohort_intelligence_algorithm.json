{"id":"347473203_Investigation_on_biomedical_waste_management_of_hospitals_using_cohort_intelligence_algorithm","abstract":"With the innovative development of advanced technology in the field of medical, there is an enlargement in the generation of other problems such as management of biomedical waste. Hazardous waste generated from hospitals is required to be managed within time and it can be done effectively using some computer science technology. In the proposed methodology, Biomedical Waste (BMW) problem is solved with the consideration of route optimization. Route optimization is important in BMW management because while transporting the BMW from hospital to depot (disposal site) there are many types of risks associated with that route like traffic, vehicle failure, road accident etc. To avoid the dangerous effects of BMW on humans and environment, it is necessary to optimize the distance. It can help in promoting healthy and risk free life. This paper addresses the problem of finding the shortest path using Cohort Intelligence algorithm for BMW management with the consideration of human risk.","authors":["Poorva Agrawal","Gagandeep Kaur","Snehal Sagar Kolekar"],"meta":["December 2021","DOI:10.1016/j.socl.2020.100008"],"references":["329411017_Using_an_integrated_order_picking-vehicle_routing_problem_to_study_the_impact_of_delivery_time_windows_in_e-commerce","325018241_The_Location-Routing_Problem_with_Full_Truckloads_in_Low-Carbon_Supply_Chain_Network_Designing","318125012_An_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_for_solving_the_full_truckload_vehicle_routing_problem_with_profit","313415311_Multi-depot_vehicle_routing_problem_for_hazardous_materials_transportation_A_fuzzy_bilevel_programming","329805425_The_Probabilistic_Pickup-and-Delivery_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","325985026_Optimal_routing_of_complex_transportation_system_of_biomedical_waste_with_multiple_depot_and_disposal_options","324768131_Heuristic_algorithm_for_the_Split-Demand_One-Commodity_Pickup-and-Delivery_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","323312495_Robust_vehicle_routing_problem_with_hard_time_windows_under_demand_and_travel_time_uncertainty","320713279_Need_of_Biomedical_Waste_Management_System_in_Hospitals_-_An_Emerging_issue_-_A_Review","319707351_Using_metaheuristic_algorithms_to_solve_a_multi-objective_industrial_hazardous_waste_location-routing_problem_considering_incompatible_waste_types"]}
