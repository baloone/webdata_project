{"id":"305287576_Introduction_to_the_Internet_of_Things_security_Standardization_and_research_challenges","abstract":"The transition from the current Internet to the\nInternet of things (IoT) is inevitable and is already necessary.\nThe main aspect about the IoT paradigm is the integration of\nseveral technologies and standards. However, what places\nhave the security and privacy in this paradigm?\nWe present the necessary background by introducing the IoT\nparadigm. Then, we summarize the standards and enabling\ntechnologies that refer to security in the IoT. Furthermore, we\npoint some major issues that should be faced by the research\ncommunity related to the security in the IoT. Finally, based on\nour evaluation, we highlight some possible directions for future\nresearch. Our goal is not only to analyze, compare and\nconsolidate past research work but also to appreciate their\nfindings and discuss their applicability towards securing the\nIoT and to provide a solid base to start a scientific research\naround security and privacy on the IoT.","authors":["Salim Elbouanani","My Ahmed El Kiram","Omar Achbarou"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492741","Conference: 2015 11th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security (IAS)","Project: Internet of Things security"],"references":["271514745_RPL_IPv6_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","267566519_Internet_of_Things_Strategic_Research_Roadmap","264589945_Research_Directions_for_the_Internet_of_Things","258508061_Software_Platforms_for_Internet_of_Things_and_M2M","226218872_Identities_in_the_Future_Internet_of_Things","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","313420977_The_Internet_of_Things_How_the_Next_Evolution_of_the_Internet_is_Changing_Everything","281162933_ID_layer_for_internet_of_things_based_on_name-oriented_networking","262215234_Hardware_and_embedded_security_in_the_context_of_internet_of_things","259638840_Anonymous_Authentication_for_Privacy-preserving_IoT_Target-driven_Applications","238676729_IPv6_over_Low-Power_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_6LoWPANs_Overview_Assumptions_Problem_Statement_and_Goals","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","220554022_Multimedia_Traffic_Security_Architecture_for_the_Internet_of_Things","220475753_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things"]}
