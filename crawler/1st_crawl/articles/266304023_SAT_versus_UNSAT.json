{"id":"266304023_SAT_versus_UNSAT","abstract":"We show that significant improvements for solving the satisfiability problem are obtained by specializing a simple backtracking method, either in the proof of the non-existence of a solution or in the search for a solution. We describe two algorithms C-SAT and S-SAT which carry out these specialized solvings. They can solve hard random instances larger than those that can be solved by existing non specialized methods. We also show that they can rapidly solve structured instances.","authors":["Olivier Dubois","P.
