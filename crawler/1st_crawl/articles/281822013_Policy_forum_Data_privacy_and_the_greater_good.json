{"id":"281822013_Policy_forum_Data_privacy_and_the_greater_good","abstract":"Large-scale aggregate analyses of anonymized data can yield valuable results and insights that address public health challenges\nand provide new avenues for scientific discovery. These methods can extend our knowledge and provide new tools for enhancing\nhealth and wellbeing. However, they raise questions about how to best address potential threats to privacy while reaping benefits\nfor individuals and to society as a whole. The use of machine learning to make leaps across informational and social contexts\nto infer health conditions and risks from nonmedical data provides representative scenarios for reflections on directions\nwith balancing innovation and regulation.","authors":["Eric Horvitz","Deirdre Mulligan"],"meta":["July 2015Science 349(6245):253-5","DOI:10.1126/science.aac4520"],"references":["281254091_GINA_the_ADA_and_Genetic_Discrimination_in_Employment","261515495_Toward_Enhanced_Pharmacovigilance_Using_Patient-Generated_Data_on_the_Internet","259355518_National_and_Local_Influenza_Surveillance_through_Twitter_An_Analysis_of_the_2012-2013_Influenza_Epidemic","255567718_Predicting_Disease_Transmission_from_Geo-Tagged_Micro-Blog_Data","24409855_Digital_Disease_Detection_-_Harnessing_the_Web_for_Public_Health_Surveillance","262173866_Characterizing_and_predicting_postpartum_depression_from_shared_Facebook_data","24241914_Infodemiology_and_Infoveillance_Framework_for_an_Emerging_Set_of_Public_Health_Informatics_Methods_to_Analyze_Search_Communication_and_Publication_Behavior_on_the_Internet"]}
