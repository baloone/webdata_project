{"id":"349988648_Mathematics_Teachers'_Pedagogy_through_Technology_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Mathematics teachers’ pedagogy (MTP) is an integral part of classroom instructional mediation through technology or manipulatives. This article describes a logical literature analysis for the MTP and technology with GeoGebra (GG). The findings reveal the intervention impact of MTP with GG and other technologies such as matrix laboratory (MATLAB); an interactive whiteboard (IWB) and computer algebra system (CAS); wxMaxima, which is a CAS; information and communication technologies (ICT); concrete materials as well as other resources in developing students’ performances in mathematics which were generally effective too. The systematic literature review (SLR) explored findings from current research between January 2011 and October 2020. Quality assessment screening of the papers was done and alongside further elimination of repeated documents from the analysis, twenty-eight publications met the refinement and inclusion/exclusion criteria out of 110 papers. The modified preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) outline exemplifies the literature review accordingly. The authors observed, accomplished, and discussed the significance of the SLR. This was followed by the constraints, upcoming directions for MTP with technology and GG, and the MTP consequences for education and research.","authors":["Jaafaru Aliyu","Sharifah Osman","Mohd Fadzil Daud","Jeya Amantha"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.26803/ijlter.20.1.18"],"references":["346384719_The_Efficacy_of_GeoGebra-Assisted_Instruction_on_Students'_Drawing_and_Interpretations_of_Linear_Functions","341735964_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_on_Online_Medical_Services_in_Malaysia","340845447_Research_and_trends_in_STEM_education_a_systematic_analysis_of_publicly_funded_projects","339349618_Enhancing_Students'_Higher-Order_Thinking_Skills_HOTS_Through_an_Inductive_Reasoning_Strategy_Using_Geogebra","338031248_Decolonising_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_of_first_year_mathematics_students","337091988_Evaluating_visible_learning_Mathematics_teachers'_practices_in_technology-enhanced_classrooms","343355315_The_educational_value_of_internet_use_in_the_home_for_school_children_A_systematic_review_of_literature","341788172_The_Perceptions_of_Teachers_and_Students_on_a_21st_Century_Mathematics_Instructional_Model","338254239_Professional_knowledge_or_motivation_Investigating_the_role_of_teachers'_expertise_on_the_quality_of_technology-enhanced_lesson_plans","338076765_Pedagogical_experiments_with_MathCheck_in_university_teaching"]}
