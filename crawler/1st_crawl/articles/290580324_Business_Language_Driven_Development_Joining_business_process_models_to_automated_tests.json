{"id":"290580324_Business_Language_Driven_Development_Joining_business_process_models_to_automated_tests","abstract":"A typical problem in Software Engineering is how to guarantee that every system requirement is correctly implemented by source code. Many techniques were proposed, mostly based on taking notes of relationships between requirements and code in modeling and documenting artifacts. However, these techniques cannot guarantee that the artifacts are always synchronized with source code. Aiming at solving this problem, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that automatically checks that all functional requirements are treated properly by source code, through connecting the textual description of requirements to automated tests. Nevertheless, in some software development areas, such as Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), requirements are usually identified by analyzing business process models - which use graphical notations of the underlying processes logic. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present Business Language Driven Development (BLDD), a method that aims to extend BDD, by connecting business process models directly to automated tests, thus guaranteeing that requirements are properly covered by code.","authors":["Rog√©rio Atem De Carvalho","Fernando Luiz De Carvalho e Silva","R.S.
