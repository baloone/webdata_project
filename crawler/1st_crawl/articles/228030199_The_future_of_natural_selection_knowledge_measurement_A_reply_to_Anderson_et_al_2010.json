{"id":"228030199_The_future_of_natural_selection_knowledge_measurement_A_reply_to_Anderson_et_al_2010","abstract":"Ross H. Nehm and Irvin Sam Schonfeld respond to the opinion of Anderson and other researchers on the future of natural selection knowledge measurement. Anderson and other researchers state that one the most significant validity threats facing concept inventories, such as CINS involves overcoming 'either-or' forced-choice item preference endemic to certain types of multiple-choice tests. Ross H. Nehm and Irvin Sam Schonfeld have conducted research that shows that majorities of students harbor heterogeneous conceptions of natural selection comprised of both scientifically accurate and contextually inaccurate cognitive elements in myriad models. They reveal that teachers need to be less interested in tests that can only reveal isolated fragments of student thinking and be more interested in tests that can reveal how students choose to assemble and employ these elements in explanatory models.","authors":["Ross H.
