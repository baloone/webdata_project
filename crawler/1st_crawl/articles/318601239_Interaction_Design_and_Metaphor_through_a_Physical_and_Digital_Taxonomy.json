{"id":"318601239_Interaction_Design_and_Metaphor_through_a_Physical_and_Digital_Taxonomy","abstract":"This research aims to formalize the fundamental relationship between user experience, interaction, and metaphors. By doing so, we provide a tool and a methodology to enable the classification of interactive products and consequently propose some guidelines for designing interactive products. In complement, we make explicit the notion of metaphors in interaction design through three dimensions: the environment, the product (target), and the perceived reference (source). We finally define a theoretical model of user experience and interaction (experiential interaction) containing human affective and cognitive processes. This research establishes a taxonomy of interactive products based on a survey in which 176 participants evaluated 50 interactive products. This research can be of interest for researchers in interactive products from disciplines of user experience design, human factors, computer science, artificial intelligence, and design science.","authors":["Theo Mahut","Carole Bouchard","Jean-Francois Omhover","Carole Favart"],"meta":["May 2018International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM) 12(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12008-017-0419-7"],"references":["314132235_Interdependency_between_user_experience_and_interaction_a_Kansei_design_approach","307541057_A_computational_model_of_perceptual_expectation_effect_based_on_neural_coding_principles","330526030_The_Body_in_the_Mind_The_Bodily_Basis_of_Meaning_Imagination_and_Reason","325953894_Human_memory_A_proposed_system_and_its_control_processes","324365629_Metaphors_We_Live_by","322565342_ASPECTOS_ERGONOMICOS_RELACIONADOS_AOS_MATERIAIS","320181930_Cours_de_linguistique_generale","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","313665810_Affective_and_pleasuable_design","304168410_Human_Computer_Interaction","286612499_A_scenario_of_user_experience","298879530_Empathy_naturalized","296853836_What_consumers_want","289963904_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivations_Classic_definitions_and_new_directions","288805272_Design_for_intuitive_use_-_Testing_image_schema_theory_for_user_interface_design"]}
