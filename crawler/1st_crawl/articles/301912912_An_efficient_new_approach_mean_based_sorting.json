{"id":"301912912_An_efficient_new_approach_mean_based_sorting","abstract":"Data Structure is considered as one of the fundamental research area in computer science. Sorting is a foremost issue in data structure which arranges the data in ascending or descending order. Though several sorting algorithms are available, it is necessary to select the best sorting algorithm depends on the situation. These sorting technique are frequently used in a large variety of important applications. This paper presents a new sorting technique, \"Mean Sort\" which has exclusively been developed to sort the number of elements and also makes the data analysis and data processing very easy by taking the advantage of a computed mean. Like merge sort or quick sort, this algorithm works by single a divide-and-conquer strategy to divide a single unsorted array into two smaller sub-arrays. It uses mean to divide and sort them and time complexity is O(nâˆ—logn). This algorithm is described using C++. The proposed algorithm is analyzed using asymptotic analysis and also using machine-running time and compared with their basic sorting algorithms.","authors":["D.
