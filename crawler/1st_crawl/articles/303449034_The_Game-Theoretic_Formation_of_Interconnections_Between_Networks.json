{"id":"303449034_The_Game-Theoretic_Formation_of_Interconnections_Between_Networks","abstract":"We introduce a network design game where the objective of the players is to design the interconnections between the nodes of two different networks $G_1$ and $G_2$ in order to maximize certain local utility functions. In this setting, each player is associated with a node in $G_1$ and has functional dependencies on certain nodes in $G_2$. We use a distance-based utility for the players in which the goal of each player is to purchase a set of edges (incident to its associated node) such that the sum of the distances between its associated node and the nodes it depends on in $G_2$ is minimized. We consider a heterogeneous set of players (i.e., players have their own costs and benefits for constructing edges). We show that finding a best response of a player in this game is NP-hard. Despite this, we characterize some properties of the best response actions which are helpful in determining a Nash equilibrium for certain instances of this game. In particular, we prove existence of pure Nash equilibria in this game when $G_2$ contains a star subgraph, and provide an algorithm that outputs such an equilibrium for any set of players.","authors":["Ebrahim Moradi Shahrivar","Shreyas Sundaram"],"meta":["May 2016IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659358"],"references":["318837359_The_Geography_of_Transport_Systems","270906408_The_Strategic_Formation_of_Multi-Layer_Networks","262974282_On_the_Smallest_Eigenvalue_of_Grounded_Laplacian_Matrices","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","253942636_Networks_formed_by_interdependent_networks","249964019_Abrupt_transition_in_the_structural_formation_of_interconnected_networks","237097184_Towards_designing_robust_coupled_networks","235569863_Robustness_of_a_network_formed_by_n_interdependent_networks_with_a_one-to-one_correspondence_of_dependent_nodes","233786218_Modeling_the_Multi-layer_Nature_of_the_European_Air_Transport_Network_Resilience_and_Passengers_Re-scheduling_under_random_failures","231061016_Worm_epidemics_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","221661521_Network_Formation_Games_Among_Relay_Stations_in_Next_Generation_Wireless_Networks","221444987_Network_Formation_in_the_Presence_of_Contagious_Risk","221344104_On_a_Network_Creation_Game","220816568_Multi-level_Dependability_Modeling_of_Interdependencies_between_the_Electricity_and_Information_Infrastructures","51989156_Optimal_Allocation_of_Interconnecting_Links_in_Cyber-Physical_SystemsInterdependence_Cascading_Failures_and_Robustness","43148428_Catastrophic_Cascade_of_Failures_in_Interdependent_Networks","24118003_Connections_An_Introduction_to_the_Economics_of_Networks","7069802_Layered_Complex_Networks","2985118_An_Introduction_to_Multisensor_Data_Fusion","305220152_Integrating_Networks_of_Equipotent_Nodes","304410797_Coherence_and_convergence_rate_in_networked_dynamical_systems","287012375_Worst-case_equilibria_in_Symposium_on_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Computer_Science","284103116_Robustness_and_Algebraic_Connectivity_of_Random_Interdependent_NetworksThis_material_is_based_upon_work_supported_in_part_by_the_Natural_Sciences_and_Engineering_Research_Council_of_Canada","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","273914442_A_Notion_of_Robustness_in_Complex_Networks","271462512_Strategic_multi-layer_network_formation","267677347_A_Clustering_Coefficient_Network_Formation_Game","263855893_Robustness_of_Interdependent_Networks_The_case_of_communication_networks_and_the_power_grid","260648147_Detecting_Critical_Nodes_in_Interdependent_Power_Networks_for_Vulnerability_Assessment","254005967_Behavioral_Experiments_on_a_Network_Formation_Game","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242728718_Robust_Networks","230738492_Opinion_Dynamics_in_Social_Networks_A_Local_Interaction_Game_withStubborn_Agents","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","222302283_Worst-Case_Equilibria","221995860_On_Random_Graphs","51992875_Social_and_Economic_Networks","24090728_The_Economics_of_Small_Worlds","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","4977258_A_Strategic_Model_of_Social_and_Economic_Networks"]}
