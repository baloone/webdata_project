{"id":"340324603_Self-regulated_learning_the_effect_on_medical_student_learning_outcomes_in_a_flipped_classroom_environment","abstract":"Background: \nThe flipped-classroom model is increasingly being adopted in competency-based medical education. However, it poses a major challenge to students who have not mastered self-regulated learning strategies. This study explores which self-regulated learning skills affect student learning performance in the first 2 years of medical school at a university in the midwestern United States.\n\nMethods: \nSurvey data were used to assess how 146 first- and second-year medical students' use of self-regulated learning strategies affected their performance on standardized tests.\n\nResults: \nBased on the results of regression analysis and content analysis, it was found that the use of peer learning and help-seeking positively affected the performance of first- and second-year students, respectively; whereas the use of rehearsal had a negative effect on student learning outcomes.\n\nConclusions: \nThe study findings imply that during the transition period from traditional lecture-intensive learning to flipped-classroom learning, promoting peer learning and help-seeking could significantly improve students' academic achievement.","authors":["Binbin Zheng","Yining Zhang"],"meta":["March 2020BMC Medical Education 20(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12909-020-02023-6"],"references":["336980979_Self-regulated_learning_in_a_competency-based_and_flipped_learning_environment_learning_strategies_across_achievement_levels_and_years","318334570_The_self-regulated_learning_of_medical_students_in_the_clinical_environment_-_A_scoping_review","309458330_The_Learning_Environment_Counts_Longitudinal_Qualitative_Analysis_of_Study_Strategies_Adopted_by_First-Year_Medical_Students_in_a_Competency-Based_Educational_Program","339005776_Using_multiple_self-regulated_learning_measures_to_understand_medical_students'_biomedical_science_learning","326754782_The_flipped_classroom_A_review_of_its_advantages_and_challenges","317140216_A_systematic_review_of_the_effectiveness_of_flipped_classrooms_in_medical_education","315710575_Multidimensional_Assessment_of_Self-Regulated_Learning_With_Middle_School_Math_Students","313508543_Proposing_a_Model_of_Co-Regulated_Learning_for_Graduate_Medical_Education","308163069_Self-regulated_learning_processes_of_medical_students_during_an_academic_learning_task","306188385_Using_Flipped_Classroom_Approach_to_Explore_Deep_Learning_in_Large_Classrooms"]}
