{"id":"323157370_High-Scalable_Collaborated_Parallel_Framework_for_Large-Scale_Molecular_Dynamic_Simulation_on_Tianhe-2_Supercomputer","abstract":"Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method of studying physical movements of atoms and molecules that provide detailed microscopic sampling on molecular scale. With the continuous efforts and improvements, MD simulation gained popularity in materials science, biochemistry and biophysics with various application areas and expanding data scale. Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement (AMBER) is one of the most widely used software packages for conducting MD simulations. However, the speed of AMBER MD simulations for system with millions of atoms in microsecond scale still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a parallel acceleration strategy for AMBER on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. The parallel optimization of AMBER is carried out on three different levels: fine grained OpenMP parallel on a single CPU, single node CPU/MIC parallel optimization and multi-node multi-MIC collaborated parallel acceleration. By the three levels of parallel acceleration strategy above, we achieved the highest speedup of 25-33 times compared with the original program.","authors":["Shaoliang Peng","Xiaoyu Zhang","Yutong Lu","Xiang-Ke Liao"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics / IEEE, ACM PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2805709","Project: Molecular Biophysics"],"references":["281792288_CHARMM_The_biomolecular_simulation_program","262390981_Tera-scale_1D_FFT_with_low-communication_algorithm_and_IntelR_Xeon_Phi_coprocessors","261357068_Exploring_SIMD_for_Molecular_Dynamics_Using_IntelR_XeonR_Processors_and_IntelR_Xeon_Phi_Coprocessors","7563824_The_AMBER_biomolecular_simulation_programs","307631099_LAMMPS-large-scale_atomicmolecular_massively_parallel_simulator","291064388_Scalable_molecular_dynamics_with_namd","274559401_The_Art_of_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation","264736386_An_overview_of_the_AMBER_biomolecular_simulation_package","263957455_Routine_Microsecond_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_with_AMBER_on_GPUs_2_Explicit_Solvent_Particle_Mesh_Ewald","238804522_Moldy_A_portable_molecular_dynamics_simulation_program_for_serial_and_parallel_computers","234124976_OpenMM_4_A_Reusable_Extensible_Hardware_Independent_Library_for_High_Performance_Molecular_Simulation","231248312_ACEMD_Accelerating_Biomolecular_Dynamics_in_the_Microsecond_Time_Scale","225092210_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation","224951267_Routine_Microsecond_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_with_AMBER_on_GPUs_1_Generalized_Born","215625646_GROMACS_4_algorithms_for_Highly_Efficient_Load-Balanced_and_Scalable_Molecular_Simulation","200104385_Phase_Transition_for_a_Hard_Sphere_System","200035187_Force_fields_for_protein_simulations_Protein_simulations"]}
