{"id":"2623432_Comparing_Connectionist_and_Symbolic_Learning_Methods","abstract":": Experimental comparison of back-propagation and decision tree methods have provided many data points but less understanding of why one method works better for some tasks than for others. This paper observes that, just as there are sequential and parallel classification methods, there are certain classification tasks that lend themselves to methods of one or the other type. Introduction Numerous papers that have appeared over the last few years compare the performance of a variety of learning algorithms on real and constructed datasets. Such comparisons, uncovering the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms on different tasks, provide valuable data points that help to map and understand the inherent capabilities of the methods. One emerging theme is that these capabilities appear to be taskdependent -- few researchers would claim that one method is uniformly superior to another. This paper focuses on two kinds of learning algorithms: symbolic methods, that represent what is le...","authors":["Ross Quinlan"],"meta":["August 1998"],"references":["220815609_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Pattern_Recognition_Neural_Nets_and_Machine_Learning_Classification_Methods","220812708_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_ID3_and_Back-propagation","38358970_A_Universal_Prior_for_Integers_and_Estimation_by_Minimum_Description_Length","346063577_Learning_Decision_Lists","243768784_Real_brains_and_arti_cial_intelligence","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","221345954_Learning_Categorical_Decision_Criteria_in_Biomedical_Domains","220343948_Symbolic_and_Neural_Learning_Algorithms_An_Experimental_Comparison","31734308_Explorations_in_Parallel_Distributed_Processing_A_Handbook_of_Models_Programs_and_Exercises_JL_McClelland_DE_Rumelhart","3113692_Decision_Trees_and_Decision-Making","2677266_Linear_Machine_Decision_Trees"]}
