{"id":"277339895_Quality-of-service_aware_routing_for_static_and_mobile_IPv6-based_low-power_and_lossy_sensor_networks_using_RPL","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a paradigm over the last few years as a result of the tight integration of the computing and the physical world. The requirement of remote sensing makes low-power wireless sensor networks one of the key enabling technologies of IoT. These networks encompass several challenges, especially in communication and networking, due to their inherent constraints of low-power features, deployment in harsh and lossy environments, and limited computing and storage resources. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [1] was proposed by the IETF ROLL (Routing Over Low-power Lossy links) working group and is currently adopted as an IETF standard in the RFC 6550 since March 2012. Although RPL greatly satisfied the requirements of low-power and lossy sensor networks, several issues remain open for improvement and specification, in particular with respect to Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees and support for mobility.","authors":["Olfa Gaddour","Anis Koubaa","Mohamed Abid"],"meta":["May 2015Ad Hoc Networks 33","DOI:10.1016/j.adhoc.2015.05.009"],"references":["320717056_Comparative_Study_of_RPL-Enabled_Optimized_Broadcast_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","291053927_A_Review_on_Data_Collection_Method_with_Sink_Node_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","278629000_Energy-based_routing_metric_for_RPL","272297652_Using_Multiparent_Routing_in_RPL_to_Increase_the_Stability_and_the_Lifetime_of_the_Network","271501790_A_hybrid_routing_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks_with_mobile_sinks","271458153_Co-RPL_RPL_routing_for_mobile_low_power_wireless_sensor_networks_using_Corona_mechanism","311885177_A_comparative_simulation_study_of_link_quality_estimators_in_wireless_sensor_networks","286897219_Interconnecting_Smart_Objects_with_IP","275381481_MoMoRo_Providing_Mobility_Support_for_Low-Power_Wireless_Applications","271457755_Evaluation_of_RPL_with_a_transmission_count-efficient_and_trust-aware_routing_metric"]}
