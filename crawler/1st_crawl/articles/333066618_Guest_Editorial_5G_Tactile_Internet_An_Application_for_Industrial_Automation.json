{"id":"333066618_Guest_Editorial_5G_Tactile_Internet_An_Application_for_Industrial_Automation","abstract":"The papers in this special section provides a forum to present recent advances on 5G mobile communications f(5G) tactile Internet. The Internet, which was created to provide resilient and interoperable communication across the globe, evolved to transport a vast amount of content with which to enrich our real-life experience. Pervasive ultra-broadband, programmable networks, and cost reduction of IT systems are paving the way to new services and commoditization of telecommunications infrastructure while lowering entry barriers for new players and giving rise to new value chains. Today, it provides a depth of information and social sophistication that rivals the real world. The Tactile Internet, the next evolutionary step, will enable remote, real-time physical interactionwith real and virtual objects, creating a two-way interactive experience in which boundaries between the real world and virtual world will blur.","authors":["Shahid Mumtaz","Ai Bo","Anwer Al-Dulaimi","Kim-Fung Tsang"],"meta":["May 2019IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 15(5):2992-2994","DOI:10.1109/TII.2019.2904202"],"references":["327921778_Ultrareliable_and_Low-Latency_Communication_Techniques_for_Tactile_Internet_Services","330435592_Distributed_Processing_for_Multi-Relay_Assisted_OFDM_With_Index_Modulation","294426302_The_Tactile_Internet_Vision_Recent_Progress_and_Open_Challenges"]}
