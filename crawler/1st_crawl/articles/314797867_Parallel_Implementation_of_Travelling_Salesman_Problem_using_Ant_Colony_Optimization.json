{"id":"314797867_Parallel_Implementation_of_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","abstract":"In this paper we have proposed parallel implementation of Ant colony optimization Ant System algorithm on GPU using OpenCL. We have done comparison on different parameters of the ACO which directly or indirectly affect the result. Parallel comparison of speedup between CPU and GPU implementation is done with a speed up of 3.11x in CPU and 7.21x in GPU. The control parameters α, β, ρ is done with a result of best solution at 1, 5 and 0.5 respectively.","authors":["Gaurav Bhardwaj","Manish Pandey"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.7753/IJCATR0306.1015"],"references":["273164041_Performance_and_Power_Comparisons_between_NVIDIA_and_ATI_GPUS","292584025_Genetic_and_Evolutionary_Computation_Medical_Applications","248656173_TSPLIB-A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","247074873_Optimization_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","242515197_A_new_adaptive_multi-start_technique_for_combinatorial_global_optimisation","228386115_Parallel_Ant_System_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_on_GPUs","222428912_Blum_C_Ant_colony_optimization_Introduction_and_recent_trends_Phys_Life_Reviews_2_353-373"]}
