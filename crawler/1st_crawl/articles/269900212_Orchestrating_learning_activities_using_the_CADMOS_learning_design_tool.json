{"id":"269900212_Orchestrating_learning_activities_using_the_CADMOS_learning_design_tool","abstract":"This paper gives an overview of CADMOS (CoursewAre Development Methodology for Open instructional Systems), a graphical IMS-LD Level A & B compliant learning design (LD) tool, which promotes the concept of ''separation of concerns'' during the design process, via the creation of two models: the conceptual model, which describes the learning activities and the corresponding learning resources, and the flow model, which describes the orchestration of these activities. According to the feedback from an evaluation case study with 36 participants, reported in this paper, CADMOS is a user-friendly tool that allows educational practitioners to design flows of learning activities using a layered approach.","authors":["Maria Katsamani","Symeon Retalis"],"meta":["September 2013Research in Learning Technology 21","DOI:10.3402/rlt.v21i0.18051"],"references":["278815509_Preface_to_Learning_Design_A_Handbook_on_Modelling_and_Delivering_Networked_Education_and_Training","267234541_Supporting_Teachers_in_Orchestrating_CSCL_Classrooms","248114053_E_2_ML_A_Visual_Language_for_the_Design_of_Instruction","237428399_Current_Research_on_IMS_Learning_Design","314527009_The_MOTVisual_Language_for_Knowledge-Based_Instructional_Design","288926837_coUML_A_Visual_Language_for_Modeling_Cooperative_Environments","265994732_The_Role_of_Mediating_Artefacts_in_Learning_Design","246851799_Modeling_units_of_study_from_a_pedagogical_perspective-The_pedagogical_metamodel_behind_EML_Retrieve","237259377_Implementing_learning_design_the_Learning_Activity_Management_System_LAMS","234603176_Rubrics_Scoring_Guides_and_Performance_Criteria_Classroom_Tools_for_Assessing_and_Improving_Student_Learning"]}
