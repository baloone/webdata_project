{"id":"355049790_Detection_and_analysis_of_COVID-19_in_medical_images_using_deep_learning_techniques","abstract":"The main purpose of this work is to investigate and compare several deep learning enhanced techniques applied to X-ray and CT-scan medical images for the detection of COVID-19. In this paper, we used four powerful pre-trained CNN models, VGG16, DenseNet121, ResNet50,and ResNet152, for the COVID-19 CT-scan binary classification task. The proposed Fast.AI ResNet framework was designed to find out the best architecture, pre-processing, and training parameters for the models largely automatically. The accuracy and F1-score were both above 96% in the diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT-scan images. In addition, we applied transfer learning techniques to overcome the insufficient data and to improve the training time. The binary and multi-class classification of X-ray images tasks were performed by utilizing enhanced VGG16 deep transfer learning architecture. High accuracy of 99% was achieved by enhanced VGG16 in the detection of X-ray images from COVID-19 and pneumonia. The accuracy and validity of the algorithms were assessed on X-ray and CT-scan well-known public datasets. The proposed methods have better results for COVID-19 diagnosis than other related in literature. In our opinion, our work can help virologists and radiologists to make a better and faster diagnosis in the struggle against the outbreak of COVID-19.","authors":["Dandi Yang","Cristhian Martinez-Rendon","Lara Visu√±a","Hardev Khandhar"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):19638","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-99015-3"],"references":["354206253_COVID-19_Detection_in_Chest_X-ray_Images_using_Deep_Boosted_Hybrid_Learning","353556852_COVID-Nets_deep_CNN_architectures_for_detecting_COVID-19_using_chest_CT_scans","352216111_Early_assessment_of_lung_function_in_coronavirus_patients_using_invariant_markers_from_chest_X-rays_images","352191445_Complementary_methods_for_SARS-CoV-2_diagnosis_in_times_of_material_shortage","351268717_Automated_Methods_for_Detection_and_Classification_Pneumonia_Based_on_X-Ray_Images_Using_Deep_Learning","351246363_COVID-Nets_Deep_CNN_Architectures_for_Detecting_COVID-19_Using_Chest_CT_Scans","350547008_A_Fully_Automated_Deep_Learning-based_Network_For_Detecting_COVID-19_from_a_New_And_Large_Lung_CT_Scan_Dataset","347992541_An_Artificial_Intelligence_Model_to_Predict_the_Mortality_of_COVID-19_Patients_at_Hospital_Admission_Time_Using_Routine_Blood_Samples_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Ensemble_Model","352548850_COVID-19_detection_using_machine_learning_and_deep_learning_techniques_A_review","350538390_A_machine_learning-based_pulmonary_venous_obstruction_prediction_model_using_clinical_data_and_CT_image","347021809_Prediction_of_COVID-19_Using_Genetic_Deep_Learning_Convolutional_Neural_Network_GDCNN","346999408_An_efficient_mixture_of_deep_and_machine_learning_models_for_COVID-19_diagnosis_in_chest_X-ray_images","345574746_AI_aiding_in_diagnosing_tracking_recovery_of_COVID-19_using_deep_learning_on_Chest_CT_scans","347348763_StackNet-DenVIS_a_multi-layer_perceptron_stacked_ensembling_approach_for_COVID-19_detection_using_X-ray_images","346909305_Automated_detection_of_COVID-19_using_ensemble_of_transfer_learning_with_deep_convolutional_neural_network_based_on_CT_scans"]}
