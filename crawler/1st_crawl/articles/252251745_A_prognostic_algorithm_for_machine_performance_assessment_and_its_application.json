{"id":"252251745_A_prognostic_algorithm_for_machine_performance_assessment_and_its_application","abstract":"This paper explores a method to assess assets performance and predict the remaining useful life, which would lead to proactive maintenance processes to minimize downtime of machinery and production in various industries, thus increasing efficiency of operations and manufacturing. At first, a performance model is established by taking advantage of logistic regression analysis with maximum-likelihood technique. Two kinds of application situations, with or without enough historical data, are discussed in detail. Then, real-time performance is evaluated by inputting features of online data to the logistic model. Finally, the remaining life is estimated using an ARMA model based on machine performance history; degradation predictions are also upgraded dynamically. The results such as current machine running condition and the remaining useful life, are output to the maintenance decision module to determine a window of appropriate maintenance before the machine fails. An application of the method on an elevator door motion system is demonstrated.","authors":["Jihong Yan","Muammer Ko√ß","Jay Lee"],"meta":["December 2004Production Planning and Control 15(8):796-801","DOI:10.1080/09537280412331309208"],"references":["237613533_Development_of_a_Framework_for_Predicting_Life_of_Mechanical_Systems_Life_Extension_Analysis_and_Prognostics_LEAP","228587763_The_essence_of_just-in-time_Embedding_diagnostic_tests_in_work-systems_to_achieve_operational_excellence","316693034_Logistic_Regression","311673037_An_introduction_to_predictive_maintenance","264856437_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Logistic_Regression_Models_Theory_and_Implementation","242929009_Machine_performance_monitoring_and_proactive_maintenance_in_computer-integrated_manufacturing_Review_and_perspective","209803035_Logistic_Regression_a_Self-Learning_Text_Springer-Verlag_Inc_New_York","44357525_An_introduction_to_predictive_maintenance_R_Keith_Mobley","11429812_Improved_estimation_of_left_ventricular_hypertrophy","3901313_A_general_prognostic_tracking_algorithm_for_predictive_maintenance"]}
