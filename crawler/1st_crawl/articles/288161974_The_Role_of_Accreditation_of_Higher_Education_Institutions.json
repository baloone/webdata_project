{"id":"288161974_The_Role_of_Accreditation_of_Higher_Education_Institutions","abstract":"Accreditation of higher education is the dominant means to assure and improve the quality of colleges and universities in many countries around the world. Its major features include the establishment of standards, institutional self-review and peer review, determination of achievement of accreditation, and award of accredited status. Based on the key values of institutional mission, institutional autonomy, and academic freedom, accreditation is currently challenged to sustain and strengthen its quality-affirming practices and effectively address major changes in higher education such as the expansion of access, internationalization of colleges and universities, and demands for heightened accountability to the public.","authors":["J.S.
