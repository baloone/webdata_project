{"id":"344453006_Low-complexity_sub-optimal_cell_ID_estimation_in_NB-IoT_system","abstract":"The cell identity (ID) estimation is one of the essential steps performed by the narrowband-internet of things (NB-IoT)\nuser equipment (UE) during its initial access to the network. The cell ID value is carried by the narrowband secondary synchronization\nsignal (NSSS) that is periodically transmitted in even radio frames. In this paper we propose a novel technique of cell identity (ID)\nestimation for the NB-IoT UE. The proposed technique is based on a sub-optimal estimator that applies auto-correlation over the\nreceived observations and which is thirty times less complex than the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) estimator based on crosscorrelation.\nIn addition, we present three methods that allow the receiver to take advantage of the periodicity of the NSSS. Finally,\nthe advantages and the drawbacks of the presented methods are discussed with a performance analysis through simulations results.\nResults show that these methods reach the performance of ML with a lower overall complexity.","authors":["Vincent Savaux","Matthieu Kanj"],"meta":["October 2020IET Communications","DOI:10.1049/iet-com.2019.0996"],"references":["340450384_DFT-based_low-complexity_optimal_cell_ID_estimation_in_NB-IoT","329191085_Low-Power_Wide_Area_Network_Technologies_for_Internet-of-Things_A_Comparative_Review_IEEE_Internet_of_Things_Journal","328038515_A_Joint_Low-Power_Cell_Search_and_Frequency_Tracking_Scheme_in_NB-IoT_Systems_for_Green_Internet_of_Things","322018958_A_comparative_study_of_LPWAN_technologies_for_large-scale_IoT_deployment","342321195_A_Low-Complexity_Algorithm_for_Cell_Identity_Detection_in_NB-IoT_Physical_Layer","339820372_Narrowband_Internet_of_Things_A_Comprehensive_Study","328382234_Internet_of_Mobile_Things_Overview_of_LoRaWAN_DASH7_and_NB-IoT_in_LPWANs_standards_and_Supported_Mobility","326055922_Ultrafast_spectral_analysis_based_on_swept-pump_four-wave_mixing_Bragg_scattering","316732090_Maximum-Likelihood_Detection_for_Energy-Efficient_Timing_Acquisition_in_NB-IoT","316705964_On_the_Cell_Search_and_Initial_Synchronization_for_NB-IoT_LTE_Systems","220971217_A_Closed_Concept_for_Synchronization_and_Cell_Search_in_3GPP_LTE_Systems","312431148_Overview_of_narrowband_IoT_in_LTE_Rel-13","303969949_A_Primer_on_3GPP_Narrowband_Internet_of_Things_NB-IoT","276419152_Primary_Synchronization_Signal_Detection_Method_for_Device-to-Device_in_LTE-Rel_12_and_Beyond","3084526_Polyphase_Codes_with_Good_Nonperiodic_Correlation_Properties"]}
