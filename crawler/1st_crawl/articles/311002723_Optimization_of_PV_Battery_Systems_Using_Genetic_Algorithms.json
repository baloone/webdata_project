{"id":"311002723_Optimization_of_PV_Battery_Systems_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","abstract":"A modular simulation model of a PV battery system has been developed and integrated into a genetic algorithm framework in order to evaluate optimal sizing of such systems under various boundary conditions. The presented paper describes the simulation assumptions and presents optimization results for a PV battery system having a DC topology, comparing current economic scenarios with and without KfW funding. Sensitivity analyses provide information on critical boundaries to reach economic operation. The fitness of a system is evaluated based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) defining the average cost – including all investment and operation cost over the system lifetime – per kWh supplied to the load.","authors":["Dirk Magnor","Dirk Uwe Sauer"],"meta":["November 2016Energy Procedia 99:332-340","DOI:10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.123"],"references":["304079198_TOOL_TO_DETERMINE_ECONOMIC_CAPACITY_DIMENSIONING_IN_PV_BATTERY_SYSTEMS_CONSIDERING_VARIOUS_DESIGN_PARAMETERS","287332644_Untersuchungen_zum_Einsatz_und_Entwicklung_von_Simulationsmodellen_fur_die_Auslegung_von_Photovoltaik-Systemen","43248782_Photovoltaic_self-consumption_in_Germany_-_Using_lithium-ion_storage_to_increase_self-consumed_photovoltaic_energy","311016150_Optimale_dimensionierung_von_PV-speichersystemen","269268652_Analysis_of_the_maximal_possible_grid_relief_from_PV-peak-power_impacts_by_using_storage_systems_for_increased_self-consumption"]}
