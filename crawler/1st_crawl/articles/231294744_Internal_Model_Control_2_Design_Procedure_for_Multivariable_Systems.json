{"id":"231294744_Internal_Model_Control_2_Design_Procedure_for_Multivariable_Systems","abstract":"The Internal Model Control (IMC) design concept is extended to multiinput-multioutput discrete time systems. The IMC structure provides a practical tool to influence dynamic performance and robustness to modeling errors transparently in the design. In addition, the important issues of multivariable time delay compensation, stability in the presence of input constraints, and closed-loop decoupling are addressed naturally in the IMC procedure.","authors":["Carlos E.
