{"id":"326502444_PAPR_Analysis_as_a_Ratio_of_Two_Random_Variables_Application_to_Multicarrier_Systems_With_Low_Subcarriers_Number","abstract":"The distribution of the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of multicarrier systems is studied in the context of signals featuring low subcarriers number. Considering the mean power of the signal as a random variable, a general cumulative distribution function of the PAPR is suggested. We show that the new formulation is valid not only for low subcarriers number, but also for larger subcarriers number. Thus, an asymptotic analysis using a large subcarriers number proves a perfect concordance between the suggested approach and the state-ofthe- art derivations only valid for large subcarriers number. All the theoretical developments are supported through simulations, and we discuss the case of oversampled signals as well.","authors":["Vincent Savaux","Yves Louet"],"meta":["July 2018IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2857460"],"references":["259397049_Normalized_Gaussian_approach_to_statistical_modeling_of_OFDM_signals","242922064_The_Generalized_Integro-Exponential_Function","233885988_The_PAPR_problem_in_OFDM_transmission_New_directions_for_a_long-lasting_problem","3434482_Derivation_of_PAPR_Distribution_for_OFDM_Wireless_Systems_Based_on_Extreme_Value_Theory","260555793_Peak-power_reduction_schemes_in_OFDM_systems_A_review","255227704_Transcendental_functions_generalizing_the_exponential_integrals","243672913_OFDM_for_Wireless_Multimedia_Communications","224230776_OFDM_versus_filter_bank_multicarrier","3944867_A_modern_extreme_value_theory_approach_to_calculating_the_distribution_of_the_peak-to-average_power_ratio_in_OFDM_systems","3755353_Reducing_the_Peak_to_Average_Power_Ratio_of_OFDM"]}
