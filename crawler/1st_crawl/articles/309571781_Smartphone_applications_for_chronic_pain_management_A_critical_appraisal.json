The Institute of Medicine estimates that >100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain,1 representing approximately one-third of the entire population of the US.2 Conservative estimates suggest that well over US $500 billion per year is spent in the treatment of these pain conditions, not to mention the lost productivity of these individuals or the burden that their suffering engenders for patients and their families.
