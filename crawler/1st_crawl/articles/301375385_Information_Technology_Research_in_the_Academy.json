{"id":"301375385_Information_Technology_Research_in_the_Academy","abstract":"The term \"information technology\" (IT) became an official classification keyword for ProQuest/UMI's Dissertations & Theses Global database in 2009. To better understand the place of IT research within academia, we analyze the network of keywords used in conjunction with \"information technology\" from 2009-2014. We identify distinct network clusters of keywords in education, healthcare, communications, and engineering, as well as a surprising number of connections to disparate disciplines such as women's studies, literacy, and international law. The interdisciplinary nature of IT research (as well as computer science and information science, but not computer engineering) was demonstrated by the fact that it co-occurred with 62% of all ProQuest keywords. Additional insights are provided through network visualizations and comparisons with computer science, information science, and computer engineering.","authors":["Sung Kim","Derek L.
