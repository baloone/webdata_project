{"id":"306398167_Communication_complexity_of_approximate_Nash_equilibria","abstract":"For a constant $\\epsilon$, we prove a poly(N) lower bound on the communication complexity of $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in two-player NxN games. For n-player binary-action games we prove an exp(n) lower bound for the communication complexity of $(\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$-weak approximate Nash equilibrium, which is a profile of mixed actions such that at least $(1-\\epsilon)$-fraction of the players are $\\epsilon$-best replying.","authors":["Yakov Babichenko","Aviad Rubinstein"],"meta":["August 2016Games and Economic Behavior","DOI:10.1016/j.geb.2020.07.005"],"references":["286512949_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","283532081_Well-Supported_versus_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_Query_Complexity_of_Large_Games","235633972_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","235509448_Learning_Equilibria_of_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","220616737_The_Complexity_of_Computing_a_Nash_Equilibrium","220431954_Computing_correlated_equilibria_in_multi-player_games","47637877_Polynomial-time_Computation_of_Exact_Correlated_Equilibrium_in_Compact_Games","322728788_Randomized_Communication_versus_Partition_Number","311569080_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","311490964_Can_Almost_Everybody_be_Almost_Happy","308849561_Deterministic_Communication_vs_Partition_Number","303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","286007129_Barriers_to_Near-Optimal_Equilibria","265413650_Polynomial-time_Computation_of_Exact_Correlated_Equilibrium_in_Compact_Games","262338415_Inapproximability_of_Nash_Equilibrium","262071856_Computational_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibrium_in_Large_Games","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria","226831896_Super-logarithmic_depth_lower_bounds_via_the_direct_sum_in_communication_complexity","223354618_Exponential_Lower_Bounds_for_Finding_Brouwer_Fixed_Points","222663146_How_long_to_equilibrium_The_communication_complexity_of_uncoupled_equilibrium_procedures","3728340_Separation_of_the_monotone_NC_hierarchy","2946602_Communication_Complexity_as_a_Lower_Bound_for_Learning_in_Games","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
