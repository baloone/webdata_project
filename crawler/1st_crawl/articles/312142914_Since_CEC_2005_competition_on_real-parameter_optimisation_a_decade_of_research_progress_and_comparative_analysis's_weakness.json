{"id":"312142914_Since_CEC_2005_competition_on_real-parameter_optimisation_a_decade_of_research_progress_and_comparative_analysis's_weakness","abstract":"Real-parameter optimisation is a proliﬁc researchline with hundreds of publications per year. There exists animpressive number of alternatives in both algorithm familiesand enhancements over their respective original proposals.In this work, we analyse if this growth in the number of pub-lications is correlated with a real progress in the ﬁeld. Wehave selected ﬁve approaches from one of the most signiﬁ-cant journals in the ﬁeld and compared them with the winnerof the competition celebrated within the IEEE Congress onEvolutionary Computation 2005. We observe that not onlythese methods are unable to get the good results of the winnerof the competition, published several years before, but thatthey often avoid this type of comparison. Instead, they usu-ally compare with other approaches from the same family.We conclude that the comparison with the state-of-the-art ofthe ﬁeld should be mandatory to promote a real progress and to prevent that the area becomes obfuscated for out-siders.","authors":["Carlos García-Martínez","Pablo D.
