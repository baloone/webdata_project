{"id":"304282804_Changing_organizational_models_of_IT_departments_as_a_result_of_cloud_computing_proposal_for_a_typology","abstract":"The standard models for IS conception and consumption are today challenged by the new ways for business departments and end users to subscribe directly online to IT services through cloud computing. These changes in use and practices call into question the organizational models of IT departments. The aim of this paper is to propose a typology of the relationships between IS and their stakeholders. Four models are proposed and discussed – IS as a product, IS as a service, IS as access and IS as a platform, with each model entailing specific power relationships.\nhttp://www.cairn.info/revue-systemes-d-information-et-management-2015-4-page-51.htm","authors":["Sébastien Tran","Emmanuel Bertin"],"meta":["December 2015Systèmes d'Information et Management 20(4):51","DOI:10.3917/sim.154.0051"],"references":["291080328_Web_20_et_outils_de_coordination_decentralisee_Un_entrelacement_des_spheres_privees_et_professionnelles","333495213_Grounded_Theory_Research_Methods","313394771_Preparing_for_the_Future_Understanding_the_Seven_Capabilities_of_Cloud_Computing","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312368182_Use_acceptance_of_information_technology_Toward_a_unified_view","302931672_Typologies_as_a_unique_form_of_theory_building_Toward_improved_understanding_and_modeling","288947775_Research_commentry_Desperately_seeking_the_IT_in_IT_research_-_A_call_to_theorizing_the_IT_artifact","287676321_Outsourcing_Business_Processes_for_Innovation","287502670_Perspectives_sur_le_phenomne_de_la_transformation_organisationnelle"]}
