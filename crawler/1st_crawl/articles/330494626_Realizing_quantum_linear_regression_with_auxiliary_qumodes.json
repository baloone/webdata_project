{"id":"330494626_Realizing_quantum_linear_regression_with_auxiliary_qumodes","abstract":"In order to exploit quantum advantages, quantum algorithms are indispensable for operating machine learning with quantum computers. We here propose an intriguing hybrid approach of quantum information processing for quantum linear regression, which utilizes both discrete and continuous quantum variables, in contrast to existing wisdoms based solely upon discrete qubits. In our framework, data information is encoded in a qubit system, while information processing is tackled using auxiliary continuous qumodes via qubit-qumode interactions. Moreover, it is also elaborated that finite squeezing is quite helpful for efficiently running the quantum algorithms in a realistic setup. Comparing with an all-qubit approach, the present hybrid approach is more efficient and feasible for implementing quantum algorithms, still retaining exponential quantum speed-up.","authors":["Zhang Danbo","Zheng-Yuan Xue","Shi-Liang Zhu","Z.
