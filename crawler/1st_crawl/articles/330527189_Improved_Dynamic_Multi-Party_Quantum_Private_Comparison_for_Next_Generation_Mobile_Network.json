{"id":"330527189_Improved_Dynamic_Multi-Party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_for_Next_Generation_Mobile_Network","abstract":"The advent of next-generation networks such as fifth-generation cellular wireless (5G) has transformed every aspect of our lives and promised improvement for various real-life applications. Recently, Liu and Wang [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 55, 5307–5317, 2016] proposed a dynamic quantum private comparison protocol that utilizes the property of single photon, in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom. The protocol is intended to compare between the private information of any two parties in n parties with the support of the other n-2 parties. However, we show that their protocol is not secure against a particular strategy of collusion attacks that leads to the problem of information leakage. Therefore, this paper suggests a security enhancement against the proposed attack strategy trying to overcome the security limitation of Liu and Wang [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 55, 5307–5317, 2016] work. The security analysis of the suggested improvement proved that the modified protocol is secure against both internal and external attacks, which could be used to control the various auction models for 5G services as wireless network virtualization (WNV) in a secure way.","authors":["Hussein Abulkasim","Hanan Naser Alsuqaih","Walaa Hamdan","Safwat Helmy Hamad"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894101"],"references":["328209702_Improving_the_security_of_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_with_single_photon_in_both_polarization_and_spatial-mode_degrees_of_freedom","327408548_New_Probabilistic_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","327066186_Multi-party_quantum_private_comparison_of_size_relation_with_d-level_single-particle_states","326193828_Fault-tolerant_asymmetric_quantum_dialogue_protocols_against_collective_noise","326068815_Robust_Multi-party_Quantum_Private_Comparison_Protocols_Against_the_Collective_Noise_Based_on_Three-Qubit_Entangled_States","337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","326630583_Comment_on_Efficient_quantum_dialogue_without_information_leakage","324915828_Notes_on_two_multiparty_quantum_secret_sharing_schemes","324480941_High-dimensional_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_with_pairs_of_single_qudits","324468209_A_quantum_secure_direct_communication_protocol_based_on_six-qubit_cluster_state"]}
