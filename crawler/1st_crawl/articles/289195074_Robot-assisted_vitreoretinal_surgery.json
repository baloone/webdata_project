{"id":"289195074_Robot-assisted_vitreoretinal_surgery","abstract":"To improve the time efficiency of current vitreoretinal surgical procedures and to enable new procedures demanding increased accuracy, a robotic system to assist in vitreoretinal procedures has been developed, extending human capabilities beyond current limitations. The robotic master-slave system is compact, lightweight and easy to set up. A combination of high-precision mechanical design and high-performance controller synthesis facilitates high accuracy down to 10 Î¼m, tremor filtering, motion scaling, automated instrument changing an ergonomic body posture for the surgeon and haptic feedback. First functional tests with the demonstrator system show a short setup time, an intuitive usage and good ergonomics. With a knife and a pick, a successful peel of the inner shell membrane of the chorioallantoic membrane of a chicken egg has been achieved.","authors":["H.C.M. Meenink","R.
