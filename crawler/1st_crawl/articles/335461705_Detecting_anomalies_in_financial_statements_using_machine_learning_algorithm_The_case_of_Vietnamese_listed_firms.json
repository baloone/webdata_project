{"id":"335461705_Detecting_anomalies_in_financial_statements_using_machine_learning_algorithm_The_case_of_Vietnamese_listed_firms","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of rating the credit worthiness of a firm’s quarterly financial report using a dynamic anomaly detection method.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe study uses a data set containing financial statements from Quarter 1 – 2001 to Quarter 4 – 2016 of 937 Vietnamese listed firms. In sum, 24 fundamental financial indices are chosen as control variables. The study employs the Mahalanobis distance to measure the proximity of each data point from the centroid of the distribution to point out the extent of the anomaly.\n\nFindings\nThe finding shows that the model is capable of ranking quarterly financial reports in terms of credit worthiness. The execution of the model on all observations also revealed that most financial statements of Vietnamese listed firms are trustworthy, while almost a quarter of them are highly anomalous and questionable.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study faces several limitations, including the availability of genuine accounting data from stock exchanges, the strong assumptions of a simple statistical distribution, the restricted timeframe of financial data and the sensitivity of the thresholds for anomaly levels.\n\nPractical implications\nThe study opens an avenue for ordinary users of financial information to process the data and question the validity of the numbers presented by listed firms. Furthermore, if fraud information is available, similar research can be conducted to examine the tendency for companies with anomalous financial reports to commit fraud.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is the first paper of its kind that attempts to build an anomaly detection model for Vietnamese listed companies.","authors":["Mark Lokanan","Vincent Tran","Nam Hoai Vuong"],"meta":["August 2019Asian
