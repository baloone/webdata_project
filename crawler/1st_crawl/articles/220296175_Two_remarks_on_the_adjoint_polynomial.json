{"id":"220296175_Two_remarks_on_the_adjoint_polynomial","abstract":"One can define the adjoint polynomial of the graph G as follows. Let a(k)(G) denote the number of ways one can cover all vertices of the graph G by exactly k disjoint cliques of G. Then the adjoint polynomial of G is h(G, x) = Sigma(n)(k=1) (-1)(n-k)a(k)(G)x(k). where n denotes the number of vertices of the graph G. In this paper we show that the largest real root gamma(G) of h(G, x) has the largest absolute value among the roots. We also prove that gamma(G) <= 4(Delta - 1). where Delta denotes the largest degree of the graph G. This bound is sharp.","authors":["Peter Csikvari"],"meta":["May 2012European Journal of Combinatorics 33(4):583-591","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2011.11.010","SourceDBLP"],"references":["285344271_A_new_method_to_find_chromatic_polynomial_of_graph_and_its_applications","285331147_Adjoint_polynomials_of_graphs","279571484_Bounds_on_the_Complex_Zeros_of_DiChromatic_Polynomials_and_Potts-Model_Partition_Functions","273244521_Algebraic_Combinatorics","265542385_Expansions_of_Chromatic_Polynomials_and_Log-Concavity","259428462_Note_on_the_Smallest_Root_of_the_Independence_Polynomial","245241899_Algebraic_Combinatorics_Chapman_and_Hall","242966635_The_roots_of_s_-polynomials","241875066_Chromaticity_and_adjoint_polynomials_of_graphs","239223541_Location_of_Zeros_of_Chromatic_and_Related_Polynomials_of_Graphs","229529294_On_the_theory_of_the_matching_polynomial","222276070_Introduction_to_chromatic_polynomials","220692867_Algebraic_Combinatorics","220441470_Matching_Polynomials_And_Duality","220357608_Absence_of_Zeros_for_the_Chromatic_Polynomial_on_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","220191300_On_the_minimum_real_roots_of_the_-polynomials_and_chromatic_uniqueness_of_graphs","220189191_On_the_minimum_real_roots_of_the_adjoint_polynomial_of_a_graph","38327972_Theory_of_Monomer-Dimer_Systems","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics","1950869_Bounds_on_the_Complex_Zeros_of_DiChromatic_Polynomials_and_Potts-Model_Partition_Functions"]}
