{"id":"344153518_Applying_Instructional_Design_Principles_on_Augmented_Reality_Cards_for_Computer_Science_Education","abstract":"In this article we describe Augmented Reality (AR) cards for computer science education that were created in the PCBuildAR project. From a technological point of view, we use marker-based AR for the cards so that students can learn and practice at any time with their smartphones. The instructional approach is based on the components content, construction and communication (3C model). The content ensures the acquisition of knowledge, which then is applied via problem-based learning activities (construction). Communication not only takes place between learners, but also with teachers.\nAll materials will be available as open educational resources after the project is completed.","authors":["Josef Buchner","Michael Kerres"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-57717-9_48","Conference: 15th European Conference on Technology Enhanced LearningAt: Online due Covid-19","Project: PCBuildAR - Augmented Reality Cards for Computer Science Education"],"references":["334004116_Using_Augmented_Reality_Flashcards_to_Learn_Vocabulary_in_Early_Childhood_Education","333208901_ARQuest_A_Tangible_Augmented_Reality_Approach_to_Developing_Computational_Thinking_Skills","277452339_Scaffolding_and_Achievement_in_Problem-Based_and_Inquiry_Learning_A_Response_to_Kirschner_Sweller_and_Clark_2006","254302653_A_Didactical_Framework_for_the_Design_of_Blended_Learning_Arrangements","3208983_Recent_advances_in_augmented_reality_IEEE_Comput_Graphics_Appl","341509106_A_FRAMEWORK_TO_SUPPORT_TEACHERS'_TECHNOLOGICAL_PEDAGOGICAL_CONTENT_KNOWLEDGE_LA_REALTA_AUMENTATA_NELL'ISTRUZIONE_DEGLI_INSEGNANTI_UN_FRAMEWORK_A_SUPPORTO_DEGLI_INSEGNANTI_PER_L'APPRENDIMENTO_DI_COMPET","336459805_CARDS_A_Mixed-Reality_System_for_Collaborative_Learning_at_School","328424245_Thirty_Years_of_Research_on_Online_Learning","284297144_The_four-component_instructional_design_model_Multimedia_principles_in_environments_for_complex_learning","223395476_ARSC_Augmented_reality_student_card"]}
