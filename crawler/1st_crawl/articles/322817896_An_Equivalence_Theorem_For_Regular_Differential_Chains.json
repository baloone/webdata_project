{"id":"322817896_An_Equivalence_Theorem_For_Regular_Differential_Chains","abstract":"This paper provides new equivalence theorems for regular chains and regular differential chains, which are generalizations of Ritt's characteristic sets. These theorems focus on regularity properties of elements of residue class rings defined by these chains, which are revealed by resultant computations. New corollaries to these theorems have quite simple formulations.","authors":["François Boulier","François Lemaire","Adrien Poteaux","Marc Moreno Maza"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Symbolic Computation 93","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2018.04.011"],"references":["245577282_Automatique_et_corps_differentiels","221588708_Comprehensive_Triangular_Decomposition","41106962_Computing_representations_for_radicals_of_finitely_generated_differential_ideals","324407379_Differential_Algebra","298875755_Notes_on_triangular_sets_and_triangulation-decomposition_algorithms_-_II_Differential_systems","296833661_Formal_Algorithmic_Elimination_for_PDEs_Introduction","286174952_On_the_foundation_of_algebraic_differential_geometry","282615455_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","275978486_An_Elimination_Theory_for_Differential_Algebra","265876500_Searching_dependency_between_algebraic_equations_An_algorithm_applied_to_automated_reasoning","265666233_Commutative_Algebra_Vol_1_With_the_cooperation_of_I_S_Cohen_2nd_ed","265537275_On_the_dimension_of_an_arbitrary_ascending_chain","265366030_Coherent_regular_and_simple_systems_in_zero_decompositions_of_partial_differential_systems","248542321_An_elimination_method_for_differential_polynomial_systems_I","242525468_Specializations_in_Differential_Algebra","240904323_Complexity_of_quantifier_elimination_in_the_theory_of_ordinary_differentially_closed_fields","226522229_A_complete_algorithm_for_automated_discovering_of_a_class_of_inequality-type_theorems","222827744_Characteristic_set_method_for_differential-difference_polynomial_systems","222777558_On_Global_Identifiability_for_Arbitrary_Model_Parametrisations","222604610_A_Generalized_Euclidean_Algorithm_for_Computing_Triangular_Representations_of_Algebraic_Varieties","222529300_Factorization-free_Decomposition_Algorithms_in_Differential_Algebra","222467774_On_the_Theories_of_Triangular_Sets","222410056_Computing_Differential_Characteristic_Sets_by_Change_of_Ordering","222301143_Algebraic_transformation_of_differential_characteristic_decompositions_from_one_ranking_to_another","222266471_A_new_method_for_solving_algebraic_systems_of_positive_dimension","220271409_Notes_on_Triangular_Sets_and_Triangulation-Decomposition_Algorithms_I_Polynomial_Systems","220162083_Computing_Triangular_Systems_and_Regular_Systems","220161348_Unmixed-dimensional_Decomposition_of_a_Finitely_Generated_Perfect_Differential_Ideal","200018953_Differential_Equations_from_the_Algebraic_Standpoint","51928823_Algorithmic_Thomas_Decomposition_of_Algebraic_and_Differential_Systems","36993086_Differential_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Groups","30512884_Contribution_a_l'algorithmique_en_algebre_differentielle"]}
