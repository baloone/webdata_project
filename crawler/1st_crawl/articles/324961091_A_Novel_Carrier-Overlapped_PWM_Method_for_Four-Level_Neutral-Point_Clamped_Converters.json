{"id":"324961091_A_Novel_Carrier-Overlapped_PWM_Method_for_Four-Level_Neutral-Point_Clamped_Converters","abstract":"Neutral-point clamped multilevel converters with more than three voltage levels are hard to balance the DC-link capacitor voltages, which limits their application in industry. In order to solve the neutral-point potential balancing problem of four-level neutral-point clamped converters, a novel carrier-overlapped PWM method is proposed in this letter, which satisfies the volt-second balance principle and can achieve the natural voltage balance of three DC-link capacitors under ideal and steady states. Experimental results are presented to confirm the validity of this PWM method.","authors":["Wang Kui","Zedong Zheng","Yongdong Li"],"meta":["May 2018IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPEL.2018.2833148"],"references":["264379860_Model_Predictive_Decoupled_Active_and_Reactive_Power_Control_for_High-Power_Grid-Connected_Four-Level_Diode-Clamped_Inverters","260360232_Model_Predictive_Control_of_Grid-Tied_Four-Level_Diode-Clamped_Inverters_for_High_Power_Wind_Energy_Conversion_Systems","224195529_Carrier-based_PWM_strategies_for_the_comprehensive_capacitor_voltage_balance_of_multilevel_multileg_diode-clamped_converters","224144376_Recent_Advances_and_Industrial_Applications_of_Multilevel_Converters","224593985_A_Survey_on_Neutral-Point-Clamped_Inverters","224501902_Analysis_and_Calculation_of_Zero-Sequence_Voltage_Considering_Neutral-Point_Potential_Balancing_in_Three-Level_NPC_Converters","224440423_Pulsewidth_Modulations_for_the_Comprehensive_Capacitor_Voltage_Balance_of_-Level_Three-Leg_Diode-Clamped_Converters","224323833_Finite-States_Model_Predictive_Control_of_a_Four-Level_Diode-Clamped_Inverter","224128079_Voltage-Sharing_Converter_to_Supply_Single-Phase_Asymmetrical_Four-Level_Diode-Clamped_Inverter_With_High_Power_Factor_Loads","3917323_A_direct_torque_control_of_induction_motor_based_on_three-level_NPC_inverter"]}
