{"id":"3356236_Wave_concept_iterative_procedure_applied_to_cylinders","abstract":"The principles and advantages of an integral iterative method based on a wave concept known as the wave concept iterative procedure are outlined. The spectral operators used in the formulation are expressed in cylindrical coordinates so that they can be used to solve problems that involve cylinders. In a first step, the validity and robustness of the procedure are verified by simulations of classical structures and in a second step, simulations are successfully compared to measurements for coupled slot antennas on a perfectly conducting cylinder.","authors":["N.
