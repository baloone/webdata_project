{"id":"261309272_Design_and_control_of_novel_tri-rotor_UAV","abstract":"Tri-rotor UAVs are more efficient compared to quadrotors in regard to the size and power requirement, yet, tri-rotor UAVs are more challenging in terms of control and stability. In this paper, we propose the design and control of a novel tri-rotor UAV. The proposed platform is designed to achieve six degree of freedom using a thrust vectoring technique with the highest level of flexibility, manoeuvrability and minimum requirement of power. The proposed tri-rotor has a triangular shape of three arms where at the end of each arm, a fixed pitch propeller is driven by a DC motor. A tilting mechanism is employed to tilt the motor-propeller assembly and produce thrust in the desired direction. The three propellers can be tilted independently to achieve full authority of torque and force vectoring. A feedback linearization associated with ℋ∞ loop shaping design is used to synthesize a controller for the system. The results are verified via simulation.","authors":["Mohamed Kara-Mohamed","Alexander Lanzon"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1109/CONTROL.2012.6334647","Conference: Control (CONTROL), 2012 UKACC International Conference on"],"references":["245430786_Guidance_Navigation_and_Control_System_Design_for_Tripropeller_Vertical-Take-Off-and-Landing_Unmanned_Air_Vehicle","245430266_Challenges_Facing_Future_Micro-Air-Vehicle_Development","321619816_Advances_in_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_State_of_the_Art_and_the_Road_to_Autonomy","316791965_Advances_in_Industrial_Control","266725113_Advances_in_unmanned_aerial_vehicles_State_of_the_art_and_the_road_to_autonomy","252944426_Dynamic_Modeling_and_Stabilization_Techniques_for_Tri-Rotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","251938405_Design_and_control_of_a_tri-rotor_aircraft","248545289_UAVs_an_overview","228764139_Weight_optimisation_in_H_loop-shaping","228532921_Kinematic_Analysis_and_Control_Design_for_a_Nonplanar_Multirotor_Vehicle"]}
