{"id":"312966743_On_Boolean_Combinations_forming_Piecewise_Testable_Languages","abstract":"A regular language is k-piecewise testable (k-PT) if it is a Boolean combination of languages of the form , where and . Given a finite automaton , if the language is piecewise testable, we want to express it as a Boolean combination of languages of the above form. The idea is as follows. If the language is k-PT, then there exists a congruence of finite index such that is a finite union of -classes. Every such class is characterized by an intersection of languages of the from , for , and their complements. To represent the -classes, we make use of the -canonical DFA. We identify the states of the -canonical DFA whose union forms the language and use them to construct the required Boolean combination. We study the computational and descriptional complexity of related problems.","authors":["Tomáš Masopust","Michaël Thomazo"],"meta":["January 2017Theoretical Computer Science 682(9):165-179","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.01.017","Project: Automata and subregular languages"],"references":["297358437_Piecewise_Testable_Languages_and_Nondeterministic_Automata","285245154_On_the_Complexity_of_k-Piecewise_Testability_and_the_Depth_of_Automata","281376455_Separability_by_Short_Subsequences_and_Subwords","265687371_Alternating_Towers_and_Piecewise_Testable_Separators","264953401_Alternative_Automata_Characterization_of_Piecewise_Testable_Languages","319297552_BonXai_Combining_the_Simplicity_of_DTD_with_the_Expressiveness_of_XML_Schema","267014314_On_the_complexity_of_a_finite_automaton_corresponding_to_a_generalized_regular_expression","257367634_On_the_index_of_Simon's_congruence_for_piecewise_testability","246300785_Generalizing_Bailey's_Generalization_of_the_Catalan_Numbers","243773292_Hierarchies_of_events_with_dot-depth_one"]}
