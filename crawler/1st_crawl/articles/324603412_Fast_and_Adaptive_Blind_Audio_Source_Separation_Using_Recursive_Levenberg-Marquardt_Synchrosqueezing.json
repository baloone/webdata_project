{"id":"324603412_Fast_and_Adaptive_Blind_Audio_Source_Separation_Using_Recursive_Levenberg-Marquardt_Synchrosqueezing","abstract":"This paper revisits the Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET) for blind audio separation of an arbitrary number of sources given two mixtures through a recursively computed and adaptive time-frequency representation. Recently , synchrosqueezing was introduced as a promising signal disentangling method which allows to compute reversible and sharpen time-frequency representations. Thus, it can be used to reduce overlaps between the sources in the time-frequency plane and to improve the sources' sparsity which is often exploited by source separation techniques. Furthermore, synchrosqueezing can also be extended using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to allow a user to adjust the energy concentration of a time-frequency representation which can be efficiently implemented without the FFT algorithm. Hence, we show that our approach can improve the quality of the source separation process while remaining suitable for real-time applications.","authors":["Dominique Fourer","Geoffroy Peeters"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461406","Conference: ICASSP 2018At: Calgary, AL, Canada","Project: ABC-DJ"],"references":["319325623_The_ASTRES_Toolbox_for_Mode_Extraction_of_Non-Stationary_Multicomponent_Signals","317485468_Chirp_Rate_and_Instantaneous_Frequency_Estimation_Application_to_Recursive_Vertical_Synchrosqueezing","304265863_Multichannel_audio_source_separation_with_deep_neural_networks","288808082_Recursive_versions_of_the_Levenberg-Marquardt_reassigned_spectrogram_and_of_the_synchrosqueezed_STFT","271726004_Second-Order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform_or_Invertible_Reassignment_Towards_Ideal_Time-Frequency_Representations","320884158_Recursive_versions_of_the_reassigned_scalogram_and_of_the_synchrosqueezed_wavelet_transform","303517833_Improving_the_readability_of_time-frequency_and_time-scale_representations_by_the_reassignment_method","289317298_Recursive_versions_of_the_Levenberg-Marquardt_reassigned_spectrogram_and_of_the_synchrosqueezed_STFT","279968719_Robust_Sparse_Blind_Source_Separation","266290834_Making_Reassignment_Adjustable_the_Levenberg-Marquardt_Approach"]}
