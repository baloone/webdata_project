{"id":"279280926_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_for_One-Dimensional_Quasi-linear_Hyperbolic_Systems_Lyapunov_Stability_for_the_C1-Norm","abstract":"This paper is concerned with boundary dissipative conditions that guarantee the exponential stability of classical solutions of one-dimensional quasi-linear hyperbolic systems. We present a comprehensive review of the results that are available in the literature. The main result of the paper is then to supplement these previous results by showing how a new Lyapunov stability approach can be used for the analysis of boundary conditions that are known to be dissipative for the C1-norm.","authors":["Jean-Michel Coron","Georges Bastin"],"meta":["May 2015SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization 53(3):1464-1483","DOI:10.1137/14097080X"],"references":["264234402_Finite-Time_Stabilization_of_22_Hyperbolic_Systems_on_Tree-Shaped_Networks","261346320_Backstepping_boundary_stabilization_and_state_estimation_of_a_2_2_linear_hyperbolic_system","257432153_ISS-Lyapunov_functions_for_time-varying_hyperbolic_systems_of_balance_laws","255666515_Exponential_Stability_and_Transfer_Functions_of_Processes_Governed_by_Symmetric_Hyperbolic_Systems","224239613_Exponential_Stability_of_Switched_Linear_Hyperbolic_Initial-Boundary_Value_Problems","220519867_Control_of_systems_of_conservation_laws_with_boundary_errors","220387160_Lyapunov-Based_Boundary_Control_for_A_Class_of_Hyperbolic_Lotka-Volterra_Systems","220259330_Boundary_Stabilization_of_a_1-D_Wave_Equation_with_In-Domain_Antidamping","220258823_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_for_One-Dimensional_Nonlinear_Hyperbolic_Systems","220258814_Gas_Flow_in_Fan-Shaped_Networks_Classical_Solutions_and_Feedback_Stabilization","220210292_Robust_boundary_control_of_systems_of_conservation_laws","220157952_Boundary_feedback_control_in_networks_of_open_channels","45866654_Exact_boundary_controllability_and_observability_for_first_order_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems_with_a_kind_of_nonlocal_boundary_conditions","43127749_Exponential_stability_of_distributed_parameter_systems_governed_by_symmetric_hyperbolic_partial_differential_equations_using_Lyapunov's_second_method","3032609_A_Strict_Lyapunov_Function_for_Boundary_Control_of_Hyperbolic_Systems_of_Conservation_Laws","285207054_Local_exponential_H2_stabilization_of_a_2_2_quasilinear_hyperbolic_system_using_backstepping","270594585_Stability_of_linear_density-flow_hyperbolic_systems_under_PI_boundary_control","266285270_Global_smooth_solutions_of_dissipative_boundary_value_problems_for_first_order_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems","261089188_Feedback_stabilization_of_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems_with_varying_delays","261051809_Stabilization_of_a_linear_hyperbolic_system_with_one_boundary_controlled_transport_PDE_coupled_with_n_counterconvecting_PDEs","260661915_Disturbance_Rejection_in_2_x_2_Linear_Hyperbolic_Systems","256227650_The_effect_of_boundary_damping_for_the_wave_equation","248399694_Boundary_Observers_for_Linear_and_Quasi-Linear_Hyperbolic_Systems_with_Application_to_Flow_Control","242655921_Controllability_and_Stabilizability_Theory_for_Linear_Partial_Differential_Equations_Recent_Progress_and_Open_Questions","238228429_Exponential_Decay_of_Solutions_to_Hyperbolic_Equations_in_Bounded_Domains","225143656_Boundary_feedback_stabilization_for_a_quasi-linear_wave_equation","222702350_An_eigenvalue_based_approach_for_stabilization_of_linear_time-delay_systems_of_neutral_type","222416548_Output-feedback_stabilization_of_an_unstable_wave_equation","222396770_Boundary_control_of_hyperbolic_conservation_laws_with_a_frequency_domain_approach","220519878_A_Hamiltonian_perspective_to_the_stabilization_of_systems_of_two_conservation_laws","220519112_On_boundary_feedback_stabilization_of_non-uniform_linear_2_2_hyperbolic_systems_over_a_bounded_interval","220259275_On_the_Modelling_and_Stabilization_of_Flows_in_Networks_of_Open_Canals","220159311_Lyapunov_exponential_stability_of_1-D_linear_hyperbolic_systems_of_balance_laws","45573789_Existence_of_classical_solutions_and_feedback_stabilization_for_the_flow_in_gas_networks"]}
