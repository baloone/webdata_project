{"id":"243776379_What_Are_Logical_Notions","abstract":"In this manuscript, published here for the first time, Tarski explores the concept of logical notion. He draws on Klein's Erlanger Programm to locate the logical notions of ordinary geometry as those invariant under all transformations of space. Generalizing, he explicates the concept of logical notion of an arbitrary discipline.","authors":["Alfred Tarski","John Corcoran"],"meta":["January 1986History and Philosophy of Logic 7(2):143-154","DOI:10.1080/01445348608837096"],"references":["273363854_Philosophy_of_Mathematics_and_Natural_Science","267671955_The_Concept_of_Truth_in_Formalized_Languages","243783227_Some_methodological_investigations_on_the_definability_of_concepts","242529520_An_extension_of_Klein's_Erlanger_program_Logic_as_invariant-theory","242377431_A_Formalization_of_Set_Theory_Without_Variables","239021507_On_the_Limitations_of_the_Means_of_Expression_of_Deductive_Theories","233032575_On_automorphisms_of_arbitrary_mathematical_systems","17415675_Truth_and_Proof"]}
