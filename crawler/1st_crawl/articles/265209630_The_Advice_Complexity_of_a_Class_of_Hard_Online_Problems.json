{"id":"265209630_The_Advice_Complexity_of_a_Class_of_Hard_Online_Problems","abstract":"The advice complexity of an online problem is a measure of how much knowledge\nof the future an online algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain\ncompetitive ratio. We determine the advice complexity of hard online problems\nsuch as Online Independent Set, Online Vertex Cover and Online Disjoint Path\nAllocation. These problems are hard since a single wrong answer by the online\nalgorithm can have devastating consequences. We show that\n$\\log\\left(1+\\frac{(c-1)^{c-1}}{c^{c}}\\right)n=\\Theta (n/c)$ bits of advice are\nnecessary and sufficient (up to a lower-order term) to achieve a strict\ncompetitive ratio of $c$ for each of these problems. This is done by\nintroducing a new string guessing problem related to that of B\\\"ockenhauer et\nal. (Theoretical Computer Science 2014). It turns out that this gives a\npowerful but easy-to-use method for providing both upper and lower bounds on\nthe advice complexity of an entire class of online problems.\nPrevious results of Halld\\'orsson et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 2002)\non Online Independent Set, in a related model, implies that the advice\ncomplexity of the problem is $\\Theta (n/c)$. Our results improve on this by\nproviding an exact formula for the higher-order term. B\\\"ockenhauer et al.\n(ISAAC 2009) gave a lower bound of $\\Omega (n/c)$ and an upper bound of\n$O((n\\log c)/c)$ on the advice complexity of Online Disjoint Path Allocation.\nWe improve on the upper bound by a $\\log c$ factor. For the remaining problems,\nno bounds on their advice complexity were previously known.","authors":["Joan Boyar","Lene M. Favrholdt","Christian Kudahl","Jesper W.
