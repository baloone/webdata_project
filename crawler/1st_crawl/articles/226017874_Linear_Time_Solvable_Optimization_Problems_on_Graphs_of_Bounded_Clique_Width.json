{"id":"226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","abstract":"Graphs of clique-width at most k were introduced by Courcelle, Engelfriet and Rozenberg (1993) as graphs which can be defined by k-expressions based on graph operations which use k vertex labels. In this paper we show that the (q,q-4) graphs are of clique width at most q and P\n4-tidy graphs are of clique-width at most 4. Furthermore, the k-expression (for k=4 or k=q) associated with such a graph can be found in linear time.\n\nq,q-4) graphs were introduced by Babel and Olariu (1995) and extends the class of P\n4-sparse graphs. P\n4-sparse graphs were introduced by Hoàng (1985) and are widely studied because of their applications in areas such as scheduling,\nclustering and computational semantics. Another extension of P\n4-sparse graphs are the P\n4-tidy graphs which were introduced by Rusu (1995).\n\nFurthermore, we show that the class of LinEMSOL(τ\n1,L) optimization problems is solvable in O(f(|V|,|E|)) time on a class of graphs of clique-width at most k in which for every graph G an expression defining it can be constructed in O(f(|V|,|E|)) time. By the above this applies in particular to (q,q – 4) graphs, P\n4-tidy graphs and P\n4-sparse graphs with f linear.\n\nFinally, we show that the above results cannot be extended to MSOL(τ\n2) decision and optimization problems on the vocabulary τ\n2 which allow edges to be considered as elements of the domains of the graphs in question, and by that, allow quantifying over\nedges in addition to quantifying over vertices.","authors":["Bruno Courcelle","Johann Makowsky","Udi Rotics"],"meta":["January 1970Theory of Computing Systems 33(2):287-291","DOI:10.1007/10692760_1","Conference: 24th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in ComputerVolume: 1517"],"references":["312703888_An_application_of_games_to_the_completness_problem_for_formalized_theories","266955143_Some_recent_work_of_Ehrenfeucht_and_Fraisse","266847761_A_Decision_Procedure_for_the_Weak_Second_Order_Theory_of_Linear_Order","248617910_The_First_-_Order_Properties_of_Algebraic_Systems","247091701_P4-reducible_graphs-A_class_of_uniquely_tree_representable_graphs","246780683_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Certain_Structured_Graph_Families","243736633_The_rst-order_properties_of_products_of_algebraic_systems","222842679_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_V_on_closing_the_gap_between_definability_and_recognizability","220752557_On_the_Isomorphism_of_Graphs_with_Few_P4s"]}
