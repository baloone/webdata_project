{"id":"337399991_The_NESS_Project_Physical_Modeling_Algorithms_and_Sound_Synthesis","abstract":"Physical modeling synthesis has a long history. As computational costs for physical modeling synthesis are often much greater than in conventional synthesis methods, most techniques currently rely on simplifying assumptions: these include digital waveguides, as well as modal synthesis methods. While such methods are efficient, it can be difficult to approach some of the more detailed behaviour of musical instruments in this way, including strongly nonlinear interactions. Mainstream time-stepping simulation methods, while computationally costly, allow for such detailed modeling. In this article, the results of a five year research project NESS (standing for {\\em Next Generation Sound Synthesis}), are presented, with regard to algorithm design for a variety of sound-producing systems, including brass and bowed string instruments, guitars, and large-scale environments for physical modeling synthesis. In addition, 3D wave-based modeling of large acoustic spaces is discussed, as well as the embedding of percussion instruments within such spaces for full spatialisation. This article concludes with a discussion of some of the basics of such time stepping methods, as well as issues relevant to their use in audio synthesis applications.","authors":["Stefan Bilbao","Charlotte Desvages","Michele Ducceschi","Brian Hamilton"],"meta":["November 2019Computer Music Journal 43(2-3)","DOI:10.1162/comj_a_00516","Project: NESS Project"],"references":["335564083_Large-scale_real-time_modular_physical_modeling_sound_synthesis","302917594_Two-Polarisation_Physical_Model_of_Bowed_Strings_with_Nonlinear_Contact_and_Friction_Forces_and_Application_to_Gesture-Based_Sound_Synthesis","337399902_The_NESS_Project_Large_Scale_Physical_Modeling_Synthesis_Parallel_Computing_and_Musical_Experimentation","317570090_Analysis_of_sound_fields_in_three_demensional_space_by_the_time-dependent_finite-difference_method_based_on_the_leap_frog_algorithm","311954850_Nonlinear_vibrations_in_plates_and_gongs","310611090_Enhanced_Wave-Based_Modelling_of_Musical_Strings_Part_2_Bowed_Strings","309567892_Enhanced_Wave-Based_Modelling_of_Musical_Strings_Part_1_Plucked_Strings","307796846_Multirate_Simulations_of_String_Vibrations_Including_Nonlinear_Fret-String_Interactions_Using_the_Functional_Transformation_Method","305744368_Passive_time-domain_numerical_models_of_viscothermal_wave_propagation_in_acoustic_tubes_of_variable_cross_section","289494582_An_Environment_for_Physical_Modeling_of_Articulated_Brass_Instruments"]}
