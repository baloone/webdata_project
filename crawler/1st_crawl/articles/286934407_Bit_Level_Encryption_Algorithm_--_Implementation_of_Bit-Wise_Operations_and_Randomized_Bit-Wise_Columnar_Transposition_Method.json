In the present\nstudy the authors have three ways simultaneous feedback\nmethod applied along three dimensions on plain text. In the\npresent method the authors have introduced few simple bitlevel\noperations in random order. Initially the entire plain text\nfile is converted into bits and then using random key generator\nmethod (MSA) all bits were substituted in a two dimensional\nmatrix. The size of the matrix will be calculated from user\nentered secret key-string. After entering bits in a matrix some\nbit-wise operations were applied such as bit-wise complement\nin some random places and after that bit-wise x-or and finally\nthe columns are reshuffled in a random order to make the\nwhole system complex. The present method tested on various\nstandard plain text files and the result shows that present\nmethod is free from standard cryptographic attack such as\nknown plain text attack, brute force attack, differential attack,\nstatistical attack. As the entire encryption method is based on\nbit levels so it is very much sensitive on input pattern. The\npresent method may be applied in sensor networks, defense,\nany corporate sectors etc.","authors":["Asoke Nath","Madhumita Santra","Supriya Maji","Kanij Fatema Aleya"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.1109/CICN.2015.327","Conference: IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks(CICN 2015)At: Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology, Jabalpur, MP"],"references":["281209380_Ultra_Encryption_Standard_UES_Version-II_Symmetric_key_Cryptosystem_using_generalized_modified_Vernam_Cipher_method_Permutation_method_Columnar_Transposition_method_and_TTJSA_method","276029435_Symmetric_key_Cryptography_using_two-way_updated_-Generalized_Vernam_Cipher_method_TTSJA_algorithm","275946507_MODIFIED_MULTI_WAY_FEEDBACK_ENCRYPTION_STANDARD_VER-2MWFES-2","272852990_Ultra_Encryption_Standard_Modified_UES_Version-I_Symmetric_Key_Cryptosystem_With_Multiple_Encryption_and_Randomized_Vernam_Key_Using_Generalized_Modified_Vernam_Cipher_Method_Permutation_Method_and_Co","267408551_Advanced_Digital_Steganography_using_Encrypted_Secret_Message_and_Encrypted_Embedded_Cover_File","259643872_Modern_Encryption_Standard_MES_version-I_An_advanced_cryptographic_method","258652191_Bit_Level_Encryption_Standard_BLES_Version-I","258651788_Ultra_Encryption_Standard_UES_Version-IV_New_Symmetric_key_Cryptosystem_with_bit-level_columnar_Transposition_and_Reshuffling_of_bits","252023351_A_New_Symmetric_Key_Cryptography_Algorithm_Using_Extended_MSA_Method_DJSA_Symmetric_Key_Algorithm","224250333_New_Symmetric_Key_Cryptographic_Algorithm_Using_Combined_Bit_Manipulation_and_MSA_Encryption_Algorithm_NJJSAA_Symmetric_Key_Algorithm","221199745_Symmetric_Key_Cryptography_Using_Random_Key_Generator","261079608_Bit_Level_Encryption_Standard_BLES_Version-II"]}
