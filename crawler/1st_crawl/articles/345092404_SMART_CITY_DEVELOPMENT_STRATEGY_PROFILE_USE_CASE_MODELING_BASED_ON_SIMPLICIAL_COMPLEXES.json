{"id":"345092404_SMART_CITY_DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY_PROFILE_USE_CASE_MODELING_BASED_ON_SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEXES","abstract":"According to three workshops organized as part of a study on public service delegation of data, use case definitions appeared to be a common issue for cities. To facilitate this step in city projects, one possibility is to define their profiles precisely and to compare these to their development strategies to highlight whether they are aligned, and eventually, to adjust the activities accordingly. In this context, a smart city profile model was developed based on the bibliometric analysis of smart cities in the work of (Mora and Deakin, 2019). Thereafter, a smart city model was developed based on the Smart Grid Architecture Model to aid in implementing the use cases, as presented in the work of (Gottschalk et al., 2017) and the IEC 62559-2 standard. Finally, four smart city profiles were identified and a profile characterization method was proposed using simplicial complexes. The results of the analysis of a smart city profile using this method enabled an in-depth understanding of the profile, which can aid cities in identifying new use cases to implement to be in line with their strategic development.","authors":["Yol√®ne Berrou","Eddie Soulier","P.
