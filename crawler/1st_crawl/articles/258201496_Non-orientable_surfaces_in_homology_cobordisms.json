{"id":"258201496_Non-orientable_surfaces_in_homology_cobordisms","abstract":"We investigate constraints on embeddings of a non-orientable surface in a\n$4$-manifold with the homology of $M \\times I$, where $M$ is a rational\nhomology $3$-sphere. The constraints take the form of inequalities involving\nthe genus and normal Euler class of the surface, and either the\nOzsv\\'ath--Sazb\\'o $d$-invariants or Atiyah--Singer $\\rho$-invariants of $M$.\nOne consequence is that the minimal genus of a smoothly embedded surface in\n$L(2p,q) \\times I$ is the same as the minimal genus of a surface in $L(2p,q)$.\nWe also consider embeddings of non-orientable surfaces in closed $4$-manifolds.","authors":["Ira M.
