{"id":"342689308_Effects_of_Covid-19_Lockdown_on_Mental_Health_and_Sleep_Disturbances_in_Italy","abstract":"Italy was the first European country that entered a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.","authors":["Maria Rosaria Gualano","Giuseppina Lo Moro","Gianluca Voglino","Fabrizio Bert"],"meta":["July 2020International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 17(13):4779","DOI:10.3390/ijerph17134779"],"references":["341398841_Changes_in_sleep_pattern_sense_of_time_and_digital_media_use_during_COVID-19_lockdown_in_Italy","341355534_Mental_Health_Consequences_during_the_Initial_Stage_of_the_2020_Coronavirus_Pandemic_COVID-19_in_Spain","341137428_The_Impact_of_Social_Media_on_Hyped_Panic_during_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_The_Iraqi_Kurdistan_Case'_Preprint","341120926_A_Nationwide_Survey_of_Psychological_Distress_among_Italian_People_during_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_Immediate_Psychological_Responses_and_Associated_Factors","340791106_Comparison_of_Prevalence_and_Associated_Factors_of_Anxiety_and_Depression_Among_People_Affected_by_versus_People_Unaffected_by_Quarantine_During_the_COVID-19_Epidemic_in_Southwestern_China","340728838_Prevalence_of_depressive_symptoms_among_Italian_medical_students_The_multicentre_cross-sectional_PRIMES_study","340701222_Mental_health_problems_and_social_media_exposure_during_COVID-19_outbreak","340842126_The_Pandemic_of_Hate_Is_Giving_Novel_Coronavirus_Disease_COVID-19_a_Helping_Hand","340732211_Epidemic_of_COVID-19_in_China_and_Associated_Psychological_Problems","340681781_Stress_anxiety_and_depression_levels_in_the_initial_stage_of_the_COVID-19_outbreak_in_a_population_sample_in_the_northern_Spain"]}
