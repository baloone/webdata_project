{"id":"234820363_Module_Algebra","abstract":"An axiomatic algebraic calculus of modules is given that is based on the operators combination/union, export, renaming, and taking the visible signature. Four different models of module algebra are discussed and compared.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Jan Heering","Paul Klint"],"meta":["April 1990Journal of the ACM 37(2):335-372","DOI:10.1145/77600.77621","SourceOAI"],"references":["321519395_Algebraische_Spezifikation","284756173_Toward_structured_algebraic_specifications","265367340_Mathematical_Logic","262293161_Partial_evaluation_and_ohgr-completeness_of_algebraic_specifications","262278295_The_specification_language_of_Obscure","255673025_Partial_Evaluation_and_omega-Completeness_of_Algebraic_Specifications","246191976_Finite_axiomatizability_of_theories_in_the_predicate_calculus_using_additional_predicate_symbols_Two_papers_on_the_predicate_calculus","245345598_An_interpolation_theorem_in_equational_logic","243575191_Limits_of_the_algebraic_specification_of_data_types","237128238_Limits_of_the_algebraic_speci_cation_of_abstract_data_types","234818810_On_the_Theory_of_Specification_Implementation_and_Parametrization_of_Abstract_Data_Types","227310651_Characterization_of_computable_data_types_by_means_of_a_finite_equational_specification_method","234816325_Algebraic_Specification","234806074_Initiality_induction_and_computability","234759381_Foundations_and_applications_of_Montague_grammar_8M_part_1_philosophy_framework_computer_science"]}
