{"id":"238831754_Simultaneous_Solution_of_the_RNA_Folding_Alignment_and_Protosequence_Problems","abstract":"The alignment of finite sequences, the inference of ribonucleic acid secondary structures (folding), and the reconstruction of ancestral sequences on a phylogenetic tree, are three problems which have dynamic programming solutions, which we formulate in a common mathematical framework. Combining the objective functions for alignment (parsimony, or minimal mutations) and folding (free energy), we present an algorithm which solves all three problems simultaneously for a set of N sequences of length n in time proportional to $n^{3N} $ and storage $n^{2N} $. Incorporating a “cutting corners” constraint against biologically unlikely alignments reduces these requirements so that they are proportional to $n^{3} $ and $n^{2} $, respectively, for fixed N.","authors":["David Sankoff"],"meta":["October 1985SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 45(5)","DOI:10.1137/0145048"],"references":["242912435_Algorithms_for_Loop_Matching","239542838_Minimal_Mutation_Trees_of_Sequences","226729047_Sankoff_D_and_P_Rousseau_Locating_the_vertices_of_a_Steiner_tree_in_arbitrary_space_Math_Prog","225466160_Rna_Secondary_Structures_and_Their_Prediction","22373860_Frequency_of_Insertion-Deletion_Transversion_and_Transition_in_the_Evolution_of_5S_Ribosomal_RNA","18664612_Matching_Sequences_under_DeletionInsertion_Constraints","17023460_Optimal_Computer_Folding_of_Large_RNA_Sequences_Using_Thermodynamics_and_Auxiliary_Information","264960543_On_the_Theory_and_Computation_of_Evolutionary_Distances","258864298_Hope_for_the_Protocol","226764076_General_methods_of_sequence_comparison","222455606_RNA_Secondary_Structure_A_Complete_Mathematical_Analysis","220075789_An_Algorithm_for_the_Distance_Between_Two_Finite_Sequences","18647098_Improved_Estimation_of_Secondary_Structure_in_Ribonucleic_Acids","17749606_A_General_Method_Applicable_to_Search_for_Similarities_in_Amino_Acid_Sequence_of_2_Proteins"]}
