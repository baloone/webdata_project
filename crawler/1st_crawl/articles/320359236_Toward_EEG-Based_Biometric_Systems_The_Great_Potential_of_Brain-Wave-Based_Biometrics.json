{"id":"320359236_Toward_EEG-Based_Biometric_Systems_The_Great_Potential_of_Brain-Wave-Based_Biometrics","abstract":"Recognition of individuals based on their unique physiological or behavioral characteristics, called biometric identification or authentication, has received much attention by researchers during the last decade. Among the existing biometric traits, brain signaling has emerged as a powerful candidate due to its highly unique nature, which makes it impossible to steal or mimic. Electroencephalography (EEG), a popular, noninvasive method used for recording brain activity, has recently been identified as an efficient technique to develop biometric systems due to its simplicity, portability, and relatively low cost in comparison to other noninvasive brain signal acquisition models. EEG signals are captured during a relaxed rest state from an individual whose eyes can be closed or open and who can also experience active response states. These signals have been reported to be robust carriers of unique personality traits.","authors":["Kavitha p thomas","A.P.
