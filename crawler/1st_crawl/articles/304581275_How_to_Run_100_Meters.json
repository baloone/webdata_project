{"id":"304581275_How_to_Run_100_Meters","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to bring a mathematical justification to the optimal way\nof organizing one's effort when running. It is well known from physiologists that all running exercises of\nduration less than 3mn are run with a strong initial acceleration and a decelerating end; on the contrary, long\nraces are run with a final sprint. This can be explained using a mathematical model describing the evolution\nof the velocity, the anaerobic energy, and the propulsive force: \na system of ordinary differential equations,\nbased on Newton's second law and energy conservation, is coupled to the condition of\noptimizing the time to run a fixed distance. We show that the monotony of the velocity curve vs time\nis the opposite of that of the oxygen uptake ($\\dot{V}O2$) vs time. Since the oxygen uptake is monotone increasing\nfor a short run, we prove that the velocity is exponentially increasing to its maximum and then decreasing.\nFor longer races, the oxygen uptake has an increasing start and a decreasing end and this accounts\nfor the change of velocity profiles. Numerical simulations are compared to timesplits from real \nraces in world championships for 100m, 400m and 800m and the curves match quite well.","authors":["Amandine Aftalion"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 77(4)","DOI:10.1137/16M1081919"],"references":["296631563_How_to_identify_the_physiological_parameters_and_run_the_optimal_race","286373407_How_100-m_event_analyses_improve_our_understanding_of_world-class_men's_and_women's_sprint_performance","272164813_Optimization_of_Running_Strategies_Based_on_Anaerobic_Energy_and_Variations_of_Velocity","324457860_Optimal_Velocity_in_a_Race","304369854_Computational_Dissection_of_Dopamine_Motor_and_Motivational_Functions_in_Humans","301362113_On_the_Implementation_of_an_Interior-Point_Filter_Line-Search_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Nonlinear_Programming","277020032_A_simple_method_for_measuring_power_force_velocity_properties_and_mechanical_effectiveness_in_sprint_running_Simple_method_to_compute_sprint_mechanics","265916232_Optimal_Velocity_in_a_Race","222095574_Optimal_Pacing_for_Running_400_m_and_800_m_Track_Races","51103355_Effects_of_optimal_pacing_strategies_for_400-_800-_and_1500-m_races_on_the_VO2_response"]}
