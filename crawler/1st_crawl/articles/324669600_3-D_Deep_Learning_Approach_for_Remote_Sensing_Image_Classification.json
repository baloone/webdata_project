{"id":"324669600_3-D_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","abstract":"Recently, a variety of approaches have been enriching the field of remote sensing (RS) image processing and analysis. Unfortunately, existing methods remain limited to the rich spatiospectral content of today's large data sets. It would seem intriguing to resort to deep learning (DL)-based approaches at this stage with regard to their ability to offer accurate semantic interpretation of the data. However, the specificity introduced by the coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS data sets widens the scope of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts. Therefore, the aim of this paper is first to explore the performance of DL architectures for the RS hyperspectral data set classification and second to introduce a new 3-D DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial information process. A set of 3-D schemes is proposed and evaluated. Experimental results based on well-known hyperspectral data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification rate than state-of-the-art methods with lower computational costs.","authors":["Amina Ben Hamida","Alexandre Benoit","Patrick Lambert","Chokri Ben Amar"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing PP(99):1-15","DOI:10.1109/TGRS.2018.2818945","Project: Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images"],"references":["320822345_Hyperspectral_image_classification_from_multiscale_description_with_constrained_connectivity_and_metric_learning","320145356_Deep_Residual_Networks_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","319770256_SqueezeNet_AlexNet-level_accuracy_with_50x_fewer_parameters_and_textless1MB_model_size","319769813_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Network_Learning_by_Exponential_Linear_Units_ELUs","307747289_Show_and_tell_A_neural_image_caption_generator","306377072_STFCN_Spatio-Temporal_FCN_for_Semantic_Video_Segmentation","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","300335442_Deep_learning_for_multi-label_land_cover_classification","292679837_Learning_multiscale_and_deep_representations_for_classifying_remotely_sensed_imagery","286639300_Spectral-Spatial_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Based_on_KNN","282904085_Unsupervised_Deep_Feature_Extraction_for_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","282555275_Hyperspectral_image_classification_via_contextual_deep_learning","282478197_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","258082379_Advances_in_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Earth_Monitoring_with_Statistical_Learning_Methods","248977299_The_use_of_backpropagating_artificial_neural_networks_in_land_cover_classification","243463621_An_Introduction_to_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines","224641343_Evaluation_of_Kernels_for_Multiclass_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Data","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770334_Deep_Compression_Compressing_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Pruning_Trained_Quantization_and_Huffman_Coding","319770323_EIE_Efficient_Inference_Engine_on_Compressed_Deep_Neural_Network","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317613527_SCNN_An_Accelerator_for_Compressed-sparse_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","317194083_Wide_Residual_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311491307_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","305459278_Deep_Feature_Extraction_and_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Based_on_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","303847364_Deep_Learning_for_Remote_Sensing_Data_A_Technical_Tutorial_on_the_State_of_the_Art","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","301856191_Unifying_Adversarial_Training_Algorithms_with_Flexible_Deep_Data_Gradient_Regularization","298902600_Salient_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_via_Manifold_Ranking","287972473_Novel_Segmented_Stacked_AutoEncoder_for_Effective_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Feature_Extraction_in_Hyperspectral_Imaging","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","283246773_Dual-Clustering-Based_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Contextual_Analysis","272623740_Deep_Learning_Methods_and_Aopplications","267119199_Deep_Learning_Methods_and_Applications","260500004_Advances_in_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images","223597859_Using_Prior_Probabilities_in_Decision-Tree_Classification_of_Remotely_Sensed_Data","222451035_A_Learning_Algorithm_for_Boltzmann_Machines","221996769_The_perceptron_A_probabilistic_model_for_information_storage_and_organization_in_the_brain_J","220343904_Stacked_Regressions","200744453_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","46392541_Deep_Big_Simple_Neural_Nets_for_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition","41229141_Artificial_neural_networks_and_their_application_to_sequence_recognition","7142766_Short-term_memory_for_serial_order_A_recurrent_neural_network_model","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition"]}
