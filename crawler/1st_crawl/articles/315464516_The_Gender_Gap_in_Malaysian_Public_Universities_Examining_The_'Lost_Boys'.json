{"id":"315464516_The_Gender_Gap_in_Malaysian_Public_Universities_Examining_The_'Lost_Boys'","abstract":"This paper examines the growing gender gap between men and women in Malaysian public universities, using the Gender Parity Index (GPI) to measure gender disparities over time. It considers the gender gap in University of Malaya with other prominent overseas universities, and compares the GPI between all twenty public higher education institutions for the years 2009-2013. It also compares the GPI of public universities in Malaysia with local private education institutions, and examines the gender disparities in public universities in terms of subject segregation. Particular attention is paid to the gender segregation in terms of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects; gender segregation in STEM subjects in Malaysian public universities is compared to East Asia Pacific averages. Lastly, various causes and explanations for the gender gap are explored.","authors":["Jonathan Yong"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of International Comparative Education 6(1):03-18","DOI:10.14425/jice.2017.6.1.03"],"references":["262689050_BOYS_DO_POORLY_IN_SCHOOLS_THE_MALAYSIAN_STORY","249721665_The_Intersection_of_Gender_Race_and_Cultural_Boundaries_or_Why_is_Computer_Science_in_Malaysia_Dominated_by_Women","227194007_Origins_of_the_Gender_Gap_Pre-College_and_College_Influences_on_Differences_Between_Men_and_Women","337469046_Genes_Gender_Inequality_and_Educational_Attainment","284333966_Women_in_Academe_Progress_and_Prospects","270327161_Thinking_About_Women_Sociological_Perspectives_on_Sex_and_Gender","254470061_The_Reversal_of_Gender_Inequalities_in_Higher_Education_An_On-going_Trend","249802593_The_Gender_Income_Gap_and_the_Role_of_Education","239778412_International_Evidence_on_the_Gender_Gap_in_Education_over_the_Past_Six_Decades_A_Puzzle_and_an_Answer_to_It","233818911_The_Boy_Turn_in_Research_on_Gender_and_Education"]}
