{"id":"222823532_Untangling_planar_graphs_from_a_specified_vertex_position-Hard_cases","abstract":"Given a planar graph G, we consider drawings of G in the plane where edges are represented by straight line segments (which possibly intersect). Such a drawing is specified by an injective embedding π of the vertex set of G into the plane. Let be the maximum integer k such that there exists a crossing-free redrawing π′ of G which keeps k vertices fixed, i.e., there exist k vertices v1,…,vk of G such that π(vi)=π′(vi) for i=1,…,k. Given a set of points X, let denote the value of minimized over π locating the vertices of G on X. The absolute minimum of is denoted by .For the wheel graph Wn, we prove that for every X. With a somewhat worse constant factor this is also true for the fan graph Fn. We inspect also other graphs for which it is known that .We also show that the minimum value of the parameter is always attainable by a collinear X.","authors":["Mihyun Kang","Oleg Pikhurko","Alex Ravsky","Mathias Schacht"],"meta":["April 2011Discrete Applied Mathematics 159(8):789-799","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2011.01.011","Project: Graph drawing"],"references":["225722154_A_Polynomial_Bound_for_Untangling_Geometric_Planar_Graphs","220452561_Untangling_a_Planar_Graph","30508985_Moving_Vertices_to_Make_Drawings_Plane","2270590_On_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Monotone_Subsequence_in_a_Random_Permutation","2140556_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Increasing_Subsequence_of_Random_Permutations","1910428_Untangling_Polygons_and_Graphs","268886749_Planar_Graph_Drawing","242529499_Sharp_upper_and_lower_bounds_on_the_length_of_general_Davenport-Schinzel_sequences","225493350_Untangling_a_Planar_Graph","222065114_Descending_subsequences_of_random_permutations","220616709_On_the_Number_of_Crossing-Free_Matchings_Cycles_and_Partitions","38362952_The_Height_of_a_Random_Partial_Order_Concentration_of_Measure","30508767_Untangling_a_Polygon","2810545_Davenport-Schinzel_Sequences_and_Their_Geometric_Applications","2373306_Concentration_Of_Measure_And_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_In_Product_Spaces","1891781_On_the_Obfuscation_Complexity_of_Planar_Graphs","1756953_How_Much_Work_Does_It_Take_To_Straighten_a_Plane_Graph_Out","1734150_On_Collinear_Sets_in_Straight-Line_Drawings"]}
