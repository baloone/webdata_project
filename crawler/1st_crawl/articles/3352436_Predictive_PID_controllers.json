{"id":"3352436_Predictive_PID_controllers","abstract":"The design of predictive PID controllers with similar features to\nthe model-based predictive controllers (MPC) is considered.\nCorresponding to a prediction horizon of size M, a bank of M parallel\nconventional PID controllers is defined. All the controllers have the\nsame three terms gains, but the ith controller operates on the future\nerror signal at time (t+i). A known future set point and dead time can\nbe easily incorporated and the input constraints can be handled via the\nsolution of constrained MPC problem or integral windup techniques. The\nstability of the closed loop system is studied and the optimal values of\nPID gains are derived. The controller reduces to a conventional PI or\nPID controller for the first or second-order system, respectively. The\ncontroller can be implemented on the existing process control hardware\nand the conventional PID tuning knobs can be used to adjust the\ncontroller performance. Simulation studies for a number of different\nsystems show that the controller performance is close to a MPC type\ncontrol algorithm","authors":["M.R.
