{"id":"326729618_MoSeL_a_general_extensible_modal_framework_for_interactive_proofs_in_separation_logic","abstract":"A number of tools have been developed for carrying out separation-logic proofs mechanically using an interactive proof assistant. One of the most advanced such tools is the Iris Proof Mode (IPM) for Coq, which offers a rich set of tactics for making separation-logic proofs look and feel like ordinary Coq proofs. However, IPM is tied to a particular separation logic (namely, Iris), thus limiting its applicability.\nIn this paper, we propose MoSeL, a general and extensible Coq framework that brings the benefits of IPM to a much larger class of separation logics. Unlike IPM, MoSeL is applicable to both affine and linear separation logics (and combinations thereof), and provides generic tactics that can be easily extended to account for the bespoke connectives of the logics with which it is instantiated. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MoSeL, we have instantiated it to provide effective tactical support for interactive and semi-automated proofs in six very different separation logics.","authors":["Robbert Krebbers","Jacques-Henri Jourdan","Ralf Jung","Joseph Tassarotti"],"meta":["July 2018Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 2(ICFP):1-30","DOI:10.1145/3236772"],"references":["329122832_Iris_from_the_ground_up_A_modular_foundation_for_higher-order_concurrent_separation_logic","324582857_On_Models_of_Higher-Order_Separation_Logic","323316375_VST-Floyd_A_Separation_Logic_Tool_to_Verify_Correctness_of_C_Programs","346088086_High-level_separation_logic_for_low-level_code","325142264_Mechanized_Verification_of_Fine-Grained_Concurrent_Programs","322133414_A_logical_relation_for_monadic_encapsulation_of_state_proving_contextual_equivalences_in_the_presence_of_runST","322133305_RustBelt_Securing_the_Foundations_of_the_Rust_Programming_Language","321146582_Bringing_Order_to_the_Separation_Logic_Jungle","320391425_Robust_and_compositional_verification_of_object_capability_patterns","316898653_Interactive_proofs_in_higher-order_concurrent_separation_logic"]}
