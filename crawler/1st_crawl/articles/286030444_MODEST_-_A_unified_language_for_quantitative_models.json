{"id":"286030444_MODEST_-_A_unified_language_for_quantitative_models","abstract":"MODEST is a behavioural modelling language for stochastic timed systems, which allow the representation of both probabilistic and real-time aspects together with nondeterministic decisions and abstractions. Rooted in process algebra, it has an expressive syntax enriched with features from programming languages, leading to concise models with a clearly defined semantics. A key idea behind MODEST is the single-formalism, multiple-solution approach: A range of analysis options such as discrete-event simulation and different variants of model checking are available for a single MODEST model. This paper gives an introduction to the MODEST language and its underlying semantics, followed by a survey of the current state of analysis approaches and successful applications of MODEST to a diverse range of case studies.","authors":["A.
