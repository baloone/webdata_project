Studies about the behavior of the security prices initiated in the beginning of the 19th Century originated this concept. Mathematical and economic support was elaborated in the 1960's when it gained importance in academic debates. The Brazilian stock market still lacks research that focus on its efficiency.

The Efficient Market Theory is described as well as some empirical studies that have been carried out on the Brazilian market to obtain indications on the evolution of its efficiency regarding information and concludes with some pertinent comments.","authors":["Marcos Ant√¥nio de Camargos","Francisco Vidal Barbosa"],"meta":[],"references":["282504526_Retornos_anormais_e_sinalizacao_nas_aberturas_de_capital","282504199_Um_momento_para_o_insider_trading_O_periodo_anterior_ao_anuncio_de_uma_emissao_publica_de_acoes","262503232_Valor_patrimonial_usos_abusos_e_conteudo_informacional","312600683_The_analysis_of_economic_time-series_Part-I_Prices","306151956_Eficiencia_previsibilidade_dos_precos_e_anomalias_em_mercados_de_capitais_Teoria_e_evidencias","291774688_Theorie_de_le_speculation_Ann","284150848_Chinese_stock_market_efficiency","273105883_The_New_Finance_The_Case_Against_Efficient_Markets","259480025_The_Cross-Section_of_Expected_Stock_Returns","256557246_Stock_return_variance_The_arrival_of_information_and_the_reaction_of_traders"]}
