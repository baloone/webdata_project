{"id":"311002594_Optimal_Overcurrent_Relays_Coordination_in_Microgrid_Using_Cuckoo_Algorithm","abstract":"Microgrid(MG) is a controlled branch of Distributed Generations(DGs) and loads in distribution network and offers more potential in DGs operation and control. MG can operate with and without utility grid (Island mode). The operation of this system in islanded mode requires sophisticated control and protection schemes. MG protection should be capable of fault detection with appropriate sensitivity and selectivity in both rigid-connected and islanded modes. This paper presents solving the issue of short circuit level difference in both modes using fault current limiter (FCL). Overcurrent(O/C) relays coordination and fault current limiter impedance are selected in such a way that protection system has a suitable operation for both modes. For this purpose, artificial intelligence methods of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Cuckoo algorithm have been used to achieve optimal relays coordination and fault current limiter impedance. The under study grid is a small MG related to Tehran Oil Refinery and the simulations have been running using MATLAB. The results indicate that fault current limiter can be used to solve the problem of short current level difference in both modes and Cuckoo algorithm is a more effective method for optimization applications.","authors":["Amir Ahmarinejad","Seyed Mohsen Hasanpour","Mojtaba Babaei","Mohammad Tabrizian"],"meta":["November 2016Energy Procedia 100:280-286","DOI:10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.178"],"references":["260509653_Modeling_of_a_Centralized_Microgrid_Protection_System_and_Distributed_Energy_Resources_According_to_IEC_61850-7-420","224148208_Optimal_Coordination_of_Directional_Overcurrent_Relays_Considering_Different_Network_Topologies_Using_Interval_Linear_Programming","49587830_Optimal_Coordination_of_Directional_Overcurrent_Relays_using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Technique","301744037_Application_of_hyper-spherical_search_algorithm_for_optimal_coordination_of_overcurrent_relays_considering_different_relay_characteristics","264006965_Overcurrent_Protection_Coordination_in_a_Power_Distribution_Network_With_the_Active_Superconductive_Fault_Current_Limiter","256390243_Optimal_Protection_Coordination_for_Microgrids_With_Grid-Connected_and_Islanded_Capability","3936960_Microprocessor-based_reclosing_to_coordinate_fuse_and_recloser_in_a_system_with_high_penetration_of_distributed_generation","3908809_Effect_of_Distributed_Generation_on_protective_device_coordination_in_distribution_system"]}
