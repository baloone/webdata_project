{"id":"237133260_Shortest_Paths_in_FIFO_Time-Dependent_Networks_Theory_and_Algorithms","abstract":"We present a concise study of the time-dependent shortest path problem, its theoretical properties, and its solution algorithms. Time-dependent networks, in which the travel time along each arc is a known function of the departure time along the arc, arise in many practical applications, particularly those related to vehicular transportation. Since the general problem is at least NP-hard, we focus entirely on the case of FIFO networks, in which commodities travel through arcs in a First-In-First-Out manner. This special case is very common in practice and enables the development of rich theoretical properties and efficient solution algorithms. Our aim is to present a unified framework which encompasses a wide range of problem variants in both discrete and continuous time, which ties together past work and recent developments. 1","authors":["Brian C.
