{"id":"338942125_Detecting_Student_Engagement_in_Classrooms_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","abstract":"Detecting and tracking student engagement in a large classroom can help tutors or automatic learning systems easily control or summarize the situation. To come up with the advanced technique in machine learning, especially deep learning, nowadays, many schools can\nbuild an efficient system for supporting teachers or tutoring systems. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method applying to a small dataset to classify student actions in the classroom. Another contribution is building a lightweight dataset with a limited number\nof images for each category for classification work. The experiments show the acceptable result in action recognition with high accuracy compared to other researches.","authors":["Binh Hoang Tieu","Nguyen Quang Trung","Hoang-Anh The Nguyen","The Duy Bui"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1109/ICSEC47112.2019.8974739","Conference: 2019 23rd International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC)At: Thailand","Project: Predicting Students' performance based on Learning Style by using Artificial Neural Networks"],"references":["330125567_Engagement_detection_in_online_learning_a_review","327858019_Selecting_active_frames_for_action_recognition_with_vote_fusion_method","321442107_Predicting_students'_attention_in_the_classroom_from_Kinect_facial_and_body_features","305779667_Temporal_Segment_Networks_Towards_Good_Practices_for_Deep_Action_Recognition","326099191_Multi-stream_CNN_Learning_representations_based_on_human-related_regions_for_action_recognition","323352121_The_Wits_Intelligent_Teaching_System_Detecting_student_engagement_during_lectures_using_convolutional_neural_networks","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310498559_Using_eye-tracking_to_investigate_content_skipping_A_study_on_learning_modules_in_cybersecurity","305277456_Detecting_Student_Engagement_Human_Versus_Machine"]}
