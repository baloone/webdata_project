{"id":"319271632_Cut_Pursuit_Fast_Algorithms_to_Learn_Piecewise_Constant_Functions_on_General_Weighted_Graphs","abstract":"We propose working set/greedy algorithms to efficiently solve problems penalized, respectively, by the total variation on a general weighted graph and its l0 counterpart the total level-set boundary size when the piecewise constant solutions have a small number of distinct level sets; this is typically the case when the total level-set boundary size is small, which is encouraged by these two forms of penalization. Our algorithms exploit this structure by recursively splitting the level sets of a piecewise constant candidate solution using graph cuts. We obtain significant speedups over state-of-the-art algorithms for images that are well approximated with few level sets.","authors":["Loic Landrieu","Guillaume Obozinski"],"meta":["November 2017SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 10(4)","DOI:10.1137/17M1113436","Project: Cut Pursuit: a working-set approach of optimizing with graph-structure regularizers"],"references":["278049029_Active-set_Methods_for_Submodular_Optimization","275669922_Preconditioning_of_a_Generalized_Forward-Backward_Splitting_and_Application_to_Optimization_on_Graphs","273005406_Total_Variation_on_a_Tree","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","284404787_Multiple_regression_analysis","273180842_On_Iteratively_Reweighted_Algorithms_for_Nonsmooth_Nonconvex_Optimization_in_Computer_Vision","268658265_Mumford_and_Shah_Model_and_Its_Applications_to_Image_Segmentation_and_Image_Restoration","267515519_Trend_Filtering_on_Graphs","263155724_A_Multiphase_Level_Set_Framework_for_Image_Segmentation_Using_the_Mumford_and_Shah_Model","263036493_Optimal_Interval_Clustering_Application_to_Bregman_Clustering_and_Statistical_Mixture_Learning"]}
