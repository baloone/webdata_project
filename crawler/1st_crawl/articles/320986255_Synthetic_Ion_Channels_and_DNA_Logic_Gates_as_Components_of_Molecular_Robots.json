{"id":"320986255_Synthetic_Ion_Channels_and_DNA_Logic_Gates_as_Components_of_Molecular_Robots","abstract":"A molecular robot is a next-generation biological robot consisting of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, and lipids that imitates the actions of microorganisms. Three prerequisites have been proposed for the construction of such a robot: sensor, intelligence, and actuator. This minireview focuses on recent research on synthetic ion channels and DNA computing technologies, which are viewed as potential candidate components of molecular robots. Synthetic ion channels, which are embedded in an artificial cell membrane (lipid bilayer), sense ambient ions or chemicals and incorporate the molecules. This artificial sensor is a useful component for a molecular robot whose body consists of a lipid bilayer because it can set the interface between the inner- and outer-side of the molecular robot as a gate. After the signal molecules arrive at the inner-side of the molecular robot, DNA logic gates can operate using the signal molecules and perform computations. These functions will be integrated into the intelligence and sensor sections of molecular robots. Soon, these molecular machines will be able to assemble and operate as a mass microrobot and play an active role in environmental monitoring and in in vivo diagnosis or therapy.","authors":["Ryuji Kawano"],"meta":["November 2017ChemPhysChem 19(4)","DOI:10.1002/cphc.201700982"],"references":["314162041_Micrometer-sized_molecular_robot_changes_its_shape_in_response_to_signal_molecules","295077088_Logic_Gate_Operation_by_DNA_Translocation_through_Biological_Nanopores","276849873_An_Artificial_Molecular_Pump","270588720_De_novo_design_of_a_transmembrane_Zn2-transporting_four-helix_bundle","267512587_Stochastic_transport_through_carbon_nanotubes_in_lipid_bilayers_and_live_cell_membranes","262191799_Structuring_of_metal-organic_frameworks_at_the_mesoscopicmacroscopic_scale","239732427_Automated_Parallel_Recordings_of_Topologically_Identified_Single_Ion_Channels","233539179_Synthetic_Lipid_Membrane_Channels_Formed_by_Designed_DNA_Nanostructures","51618548_Wang_Y_Zheng_D_Tan_Q_Wang_MX_Gu_LQNanopore-based_detection_of_circulating_microRNAs_in_lung_cancer_patients_Nat_Nanotechnol_610_668-674","44593274_Molecular_Robots_Guided_by_Prescriptive_Landscapes","23310374_The_potential_and_challenges_of_nanopore_sequencing","14264287_Characterization_of_Individual_Polynucleotide_Molecules_Using_a_Membrane_Channel","8169435_Light-activated_ion_channels_for_remote_control_of_neuronal_firing","7237731_Rothemund_PWK_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns_Nature_440_297-302","7186997_Molecular_Engineering_An_Approach_to_the_Development_of_General_Capabilities_for_Molecular_Manipulation","6633777_Lipid_Bilayer_Formation_by_Contacting_Monolayers_in_a_Microfluidic_Device_for_Membrane_Protein_Analysis","320251419_Analysis_of_Pore_Formation_and_Protein_Translocation_Using_Large_Biological_Nanopores","320061400_MicroRNA_Detection_at_Femtomolar_Concentration_by_a_Biological_Nanopore_with_an_Isothermal_Amplification","316200752_Nanopore_Logic_Operation_with_DNA_to_RNA_Transcription_in_a_Droplet_System","314488699_Metal-Organic_Cuboctahedra_for_Synthetic_Ion_Channels_with_Multiple_Conductance_States","313018300_Amplification_and_Quantification_of_an_Antisense_Oligonucleotide_from_Target_microRNA_Using_Programmable_DNA_and_a_Biological_Nanopore","301915387_Hairpin_DNA_Unzipping_Analysis_Using_a_Biological_Nanopore_Array","290985352_Channel_Current_Analysis_for_Pore-forming_Properties_of_an_Antimicrobial_Peptide_Magainin_1_Using_the_Droplet_Contact_Method","262930455_Molecular_Robots_with_Sensors_and_Intelligence","261030890_Programming_Nanopore_Ion_Flow_for_Encoded_Multiplex_MicroRNA_Detection","243822955_A_Non-Peptidic_Ion_Channel_with_K_Selectivity","240849933_Ein_nichtpeptidischer_Ionenkanal_mit_K-Selektivitat","237865129_Ion_channels_based_on_bis-macrocyclic_bolaamphiphiles_Effects_of_hydrophobic_substitutions","236598515_Synthetic_Ion_Channels","236226250_Bright_Ion_Channels_and_Lipid_Bilayers","231433987_Artificial_non-peptide_single_ion_channels","231208991_Transition_Metal-Containing_Rotaxanes_and_Catenanes_in_Motion_Toward_Molecular_Machines_and_Motors","226910375_Model_ion_channels_Gramicidin_and_alamethicin","224878512_Ion_channel_drug_potency_assay_with_an_artificial_bilayer_chip","221802473_Miniaturised_technologies_for_the_development_of_artificial_lipid_bilayer_systems","221740258_DNA-based_assembly_lines_and_nanofactories","51427516_Making_Molecular_Machines_Work","51236952_ChemInform_Abstract_Ionic_Conductance_of_Synthetic_Channels_Analysis_Lessons_and_Recommendations","51109114_Rapid_Detection_of_a_Cocaine-Binding_Aptamer_Using_Biological_Nanopores_on_a_Chip","26820726_Croce_CM_Causes_and_consequences_of_microRNA_dysregulation_in_cancer_Nat_Rev_Genet_10_704-714_Review","26686915_Nanopore_analytics_Sensing_of_single_molecules","23413476_Screening_Blockers_Against_a_Potassium_Channel_with_a_Droplet_Interface_Bilayer_Array","17085171_Ionic_selectivity_revisited_The_role_of_kinetic_and_equilibrium_processes_in_ion_permeation_through_channels","13071763_Stochastic_sensing_of_organic_analytes_by_a_pore-forming_protein_containing_a_molecular_adapter","12299729_Interaction_of_the_Noncovalent_Molecular_Adapter_b-Cyclodextrin_with_the_Staphylococcal_a-Hemolysin_Pore","11789887_Stochastic_Sensors_Inspired_by_Biology","11010358_Active_transport_of_Ca2_by_an_artificial_photosynthetic_membrane","7447507_Principles_of_Selective_Ion_Transport_in_Channels_and_Pumps","6576320_Synthetic_Ion_Channels_and_Pores_2004-2005","6265109_Functional_Bionetworks_from_Nanoliter_Water_Droplets","5278718_Synthetic_Ion_Channel_Based_on_Metal-Organic_Polyhedra"]}
