{"id":"260429378_A_Note_on_the_Approximation_of_Mean-Payoff_Games","abstract":"We consider the problem of designing approximation schemes for the values of mean-payoff games. It was recently shown that (1) mean-payoff with rational weights scaled on [−1,1][−1,1] admit additive fully-polynomial approximation schemes, and (2) mean-payoff games with positive weights admit relative fully-polynomial approximation schemes. We show that the problem of designing additive/relative approximation schemes for general mean-payoff games (i.e. with no constraint on their edge-weights) is P-time equivalent to determining their exact solution.","authors":["Raffaella Gentilini"],"meta":["July 2014Information Processing Letters 114(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2014.02.010"],"references":["262256395_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Energy_Games_with_Special_Weight_Structures","226777210_Infinite_Runs_in_Weighted_Timed_Automata_with_Energy_Constraints","225621458_Faster_algorithms_for_mean-payoff_games","222079059_Cyclic_games_and_an_algorithm_to_find_minimax_cycle_means_in_directed_graphs","221591753_Trees_Automata_and_Games","220897618_Stochastic_Mean_Payoff_Games_Smoothed_Analysis_and_Approximation_Schemes","220897171_The_Cost_of_Traveling_between_Languages","220589096_Cyclical_games_with_prohibitions","51958707_Quantitative_Languages_Defined_by_Functional_Automata","24304732_Better_Quality_in_Synthesis_through_Quantitative_Objectives","2795069_On_Model-Checking_for_Fragments_of_-Calculus","316518696_On_algorithms_for_simple_stochastic_games","301865772_Automata_trees_and_games","297987509_Resource_interfaces","265996860_Mean_Cost_Cyclical_Games","262348247_Automated_analysis_of_real-time_scheduling_using_graph_games","257800571_On_Canonical_Forms_for_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Mean_Payoff_Games","254022889_Playing_games_with_scenario-_and_resource-aware_SDF_graphs_through_policy_iteration","246165090_Fast_Algorithms_for_Monotonic_Discounted_Linear_Programs_with_Two_Variables_per_Inequality","243007987_Extensions_of_two_person_zero_sum_games1","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","228057894_Computational_Complexity","226950761_Potential_theory_for_mean_payoff_games","226645887_Positional_strategies_for_mean_payoff_games","225536626_On_model-checking_for_fragments_of_m-calculus","225385504_Quantitative_Languages","222785304_The_complexity_of_mean_payoff_games_on_graphs","222504823_Deciding_the_winner_in_parity_games_is_in_UP_co-UP","221558313_Quantitative_Languages","220975648_From_Parity_and_Payoff_Games_to_Linear_Programming","220975230_A_Combinatorial_Strongly_Subexponential_Strategy_Improvement_Algorithm_for_Mean_Payoff_Games","220896827_Results_on_the_Propositional_m-Calculus","220779923_On_the_Equilibria_of_Alternating_Move_Games","220769694_How_to_solve_large_scale_deterministic_games_with_mean_payoff_by_policy_iteration","220111764_Optimal_search_for_rationals","30816007_Simple_Stochastic_Games_Parity_Games_Mean_Payoff_Games_and_Discounted_Payoff_Games_Are_All_LP-Type_Problems","2313109_On_Algorithms_for_Simple_Stochastic_Games","2245006_Deciding_the_Winner_in_Parity_Games_Is_in_UP"]}
