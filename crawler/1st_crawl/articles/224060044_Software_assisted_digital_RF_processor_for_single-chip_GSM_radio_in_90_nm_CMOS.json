{"id":"224060044_Software_assisted_digital_RF_processor_for_single-chip_GSM_radio_in_90_nm_CMOS","abstract":"This paper proposes and describes a new software and application programming interface view of an RF transceiver as implemented in the first single-chip GSM radio in 90 nm CMOS. It demonstrates benefits of using programmable digital control logic in deep-submicron CMOS RF system. It also describes a micro-processor architecture design in digital RF processor (DRP) and how it controls compensation for process, temperature and voltage variations of the analog and RF circuits to meet the required RF performance","authors":["Robert Bogdan Staszewski","Thomas Jung","Khurram Muhammad","D.
