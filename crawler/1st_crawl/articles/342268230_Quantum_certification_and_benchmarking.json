{"id":"342268230_Quantum_certification_and_benchmarking","abstract":"With the rapid development of quantum technologies, a pressing need has emerged for a wide array of tools for the certification and characterization of quantum devices. Such tools are critical because the powerful applications of quantum information science will only be realized if stringent levels of precision of components can be reached and their functioning guaranteed. This Technical Review provides a brief overview of the known characterization methods for certification, benchmarking and tomographic reconstruction of quantum states and processes, and outlines their applications in quantum computing, simulation and communication.","authors":["Jens Eisert","Dominik Hangleiter","Nathan Walk","Ingo Roth"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1038/s42254-020-0186-4"],"references":["337494316_Characterizing_large-scale_quantum_computers_via_cycle_benchmarking","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","335634767_Multiqubit_randomized_benchmarking_using_few_samples","335437242_Proper_error_bars_for_self-calibrating_quantum_tomography","335310517_A_new_class_of_efficient_randomized_benchmarking_protocols","333120262_Self-verifying_variational_quantum_simulation_of_lattice_models","333035737_Probing_Renyi_entanglement_entropy_via_randomized_measurements","332375846_Resource-efficient_verification_of_quantum_computing_using_Serfling's_bound","331655467_Reconstructing_quantum_states_with_generative_models","331218924_Benchmarking_of_Gaussian_boson_sampling_using_two-point_correlators","328581827_On_the_complexity_and_verification_of_quantum_random_circuit_sampling","328376157_Quantum_internet_A_vision_for_the_road_ahead","322537818_A_Simple_Protocol_for_Certifying_Graph_States_and_Applications_in_Quantum_Networks","320014843_Verification_of_Many-Qubit_States","319952928_Verification_of_Quantum_Computation_An_Overview_of_Existing_Approaches","319642815_Optimal_Verification_of_Entangled_States_with_Local_Measurements","319272106_Verifier-on-a-Leash_new_schemes_for_verifiable_delegated_quantum_computation_with_quasilinear_resources","315697390_Randomized_benchmarking_with_gate-dependent_noise","315116941_Many-body_quantum_state_tomography_with_neural_networks","314433922_Fidelity_Witnesses_for_Fermionic_Quantum_Simulations","314182326_Architectures_for_Quantum_Simulation_Showing_a_Quantum_Speedup","313775979_Demonstration_of_qubit_operations_below_a_rigorous_fault_tolerance_threshold_with_gate_set_tomography","313434687_Experimental_Comparison_of_Two_Quantum_Computing_Architectures","312283236_Guaranteed_recovery_of_quantum_processes_from_few_measurements","350646502_Self-testing_of_quantum_systems_a_review","347416756_Efficient_Estimation_of_Pauli_Channels","343459510_Classical_Verification_of_Quantum_Computations","338518867_Computationally-secure_and_composable_remote_state_preparation","338518584_Computationally-Secure_and_Composable_Remote_State_Preparation","338418984_Cross-Platform_Verification_of_Intermediate_Scale_Quantum_Devices","335951195_Validating_quantum_computers_using_randomized_model_circuits","335093733_Randomized_Benchmarking_for_Individual_Quantum_Gates","334583265_Direct_Randomized_Benchmarking_for_Multiqubit_Devices","333468930_Statistical_analysis_of_randomized_benchmarking","333461157_Sample_Complexity_of_Device-Independently_Certified_Quantum_Supremacy","333131033_Confidence_Polytopes_in_Quantum_State_Tomography","332085949_Experimental_learning_of_quantum_states","331140910_Fast_state_tomography_with_optimal_error_bounds","324181977_Classical_Verification_of_Quantum_Computations","323694543_Approximate_Randomized_Benchmarking_for_Finite_Groups","323550259_Recovering_Quantum_Gates_from_Few_Average_Gate_Fidelities","323003847_Certifying_the_Building_Blocks_of_Quantum_Computers_from_Bell's_Theorem","322419009_Low-degree_testing_for_quantum_states","321745187_The_European_Quantum_Technologies_Roadmap","319683691_Roads_towards_fault-tolerant_universal_quantum_computation","318392148_Colloquium_Quantum_coherence_as_a_resource","316617695_Stabiliser_states_are_efficiently_PAC-Learnable","314138030_An_Automatic_Inequality_Prover_and_Instance_Optimal_Identity_Testing","311737153_Complexity-Theoretic_Foundations_of_Quantum_Supremacy_Experiments","311431383_Quantitative_entanglement_witnesses","311223054_Private_quantum_computation_An_introduction_to_blind_quantum_computing_and_related_protocols","307930987_Quantum_Coherence_as_a_Resource","305821843_Demonstration_of_a_small_programmable_quantum_computer_with_atomic_qubits","305780465_Characterizing_Quantum_Supremacy_in_Near-Term_Devices","301331136_Robust_characterization_of_leakage_errors"]}
