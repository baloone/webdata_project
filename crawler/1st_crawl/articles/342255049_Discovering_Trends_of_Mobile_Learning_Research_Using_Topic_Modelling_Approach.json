{"id":"342255049_Discovering_Trends_of_Mobile_Learning_Research_Using_Topic_Modelling_Approach","abstract":"This paper reports a map of identified topics from mobile learning research. Mobile learning is an emerging paradigm in an educational context as its adoption in an educational institution is growing rapidly. The students are already using and familiar with it. The publications from the last ten years were examined. Two approaches were employed to identify themes, i.e. word cloud and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The result shows that mobile learning research is shifting from the development into optimization paradigm. This research is beneficial for mobile learning literature to inform the researcher and practitioner in the mobile learning area in terms of research topic trend and therefore consider it as a basis for designing mobile learning system in the future.","authors":["Almed Hamzah","Ahmad Fathan Hidayatullah","Andhika Persada"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 14(09):4","DOI:10.3991/ijim.v14i09.11069"],"references":["331576561_A_Trend_Analysis_of_Machine_Learning_Research_with_Topic_Models_and_Mann-Kendall_Test","330745205_Students'_Beliefs_Regarding_the_Use_of_E-portfolio_to_Enhance_Cognitive_Skills_in_a_Blended_Learning_Environment","329248870_Latent_Dirichlet_allocation_LDA_and_topic_modeling_models_applications_a_survey","328547306_Innovative_English_Classroom_Teaching_Based_on_Online_Computer_Technology_in_Rural_Middle_and_Primary_Schools","328545591_Blended_Learning_Innovation_Model_among_College_Students_Based_on_Internet","327969731_Investigation_of_Students'_Mobile_Phone_Usage_and_Influences_towards_Their_Mobile_Learning_Adoption_A_Case_Study_in_Myanmar","338646528_Tablets_and_apps_for_promoting_robotics_mathematics_STEM_education_and_literacy_in_early_childhood_education","337464833_A_Research_Synthesis_of_the_Real_Value_of_Self-Proclaimed_Mobile_Educational_Applications_for_Young_Children","337464741_The_Use_of_Developmentally_Mobile_Applications_for_Preparing_Pre-Service_Teachers_to_Promote_STEM_Activities_in_Preschool_Classrooms","337464707_Apps_to_Promote_Computational_Thinking_Concepts_and_Coding_Skills_in_Children_of_Preschool_and_Pre-Primary_School_Age"]}
