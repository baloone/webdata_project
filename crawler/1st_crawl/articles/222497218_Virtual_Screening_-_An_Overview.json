{"id":"222497218_Virtual_Screening_-_An_Overview","abstract":"Recent advances in combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening have made it possible for chemists to synthesize large numbers of compounds. However, this is still a small percentage of the total number that could be synthesized. Virtual screening encompasses a variety of computational techniques that allow chemists to reduce a huge virtual library to a more manageable size. This review presents the current state of the art in virtual screening and discusses approaches that will allow the evaluation of larger numbers of compounds.","authors":["W.
