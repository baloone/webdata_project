{"id":"317307993_A_TWO-STEP_DECISION_FUSION_STRATEGY_APPLICATION_TO_HYPERSPECTRAL_AND_MULTISPECTRAL_IMAGES_FOR_URBAN_CLASSIFICATION","abstract":"Very high spatial resolution multispectral images and lower spatial resolution hyperspectral images are complementary sources for\nurban object classification. The first enables a fine delineation of objects, while the second can better discriminate classes and\nconsider richer land cover semantics. This paper presents a decision fusion scheme taking advantage of both sources classification\nmaps, to produce a better classification map. The proposed method aims at dealing with both semantic and spatial uncertainties and\nconsists in two steps. First, class membership maps are merged at pixel level. Several fusion rules are considered and compared in\nthis study. Secondly, classification is obtained from a global regularization of a graphical model, involving a fit-to-data term related\nto class membership measures and an image based contrast sensitive regularization term. Results are presented on three datasets. The\nclassification accuracy is improved up to 5 %, with comparison to the best single source classification accuracy.","authors":["Walid Ouerghemmi","Arnaud Le Bris","Nesrine Chehata","Cl√©ment Mallet"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-1-W1-167-2017","Project: ANR HYEP"],"references":["313652860_Measuring_Fuzzy_uncertainty","311695249_Data_Fusion_and_Remote_Sensing_-_An_Ever-Growing_Relationship","306404246_Fusion_of_hyperspectral_and_VHR_multispectral_image_classifications_in_urban_areas","275218415_Hyperspectral_Pansharpening_A_Review","245508781_Assessment_of_Very_High_Spatial_Resolution_Satellite_Image_Segmentations","308847282_Effective_semantic_pixel_labelling_with_convolutional_networks_and_Conditional_Random_Fields","288929471_Translation_Statistical_learning_theory","258514525_Object-based_fusion_of_multitemporal_multiangle_ENVISAT_ASAR_and_HJ-1B_multispectral_data_for_urban_land-cover_mapping","244953792_A_Comparison_of_Urban_Mapping_Methods_Using_High-Resolution_Digital_Imagery","243659499_Combination_of_fuzzy_information_in_the_framework_of_possibility_theory"]}
