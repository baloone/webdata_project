{"id":"279808820_Peaceman-Rachford_splitting_for_a_class_of_nonconvex_optimization_problems","abstract":"We study the applicability of the Peaceman-Rachford (PR) splitting method for\nsolving nonconvex optimization problems. When applied to minimizing the sum of\na strongly convex Lipschitz differentiable function and a proper closed\nfunction, we show that if the strongly convex function has a large enough\nstrong convexity modulus and the step-size parameter is chosen below a\ncomputable threshold, then any cluster point of the sequence generated, if\nexists, will give a stationary point of the optimization problem. We also give\nsufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the sequence generated. We\nthen discuss one way to split the objective so that the proposed method can be\nsuitably applied to solving optimization problems whose objective is the sum of\na (not necessarily strongly) convex Lipschitz differentiable function and a\nproper closed function that is bounded below with a bounded domain; this\nsetting covers a large class of nonconvex feasibility problems and constrained\nleast-squares problems. The numerical tests show that our proposed method is\nfaster than the Douglas-Rachford splitting method when applied to finding a\nsparse solution of a linear system, but with a slightly worse solution quality.","authors":["G.
