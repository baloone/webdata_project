{"id":"280695453_The_capacity_of_mid-pregnancy_cervical_length_to_predict_preterm_birth_in_low-risk_women_A_national_cohort_study","abstract":"We investigated the predictive capacity of mid-trimester cervical length (CL) measurement for spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth.\nWe performed a prospective observational cohort study in nulliparous women and low risk multiparous women with a singleton pregnancy between 16(+0) -21(+6) weeks. We assessed the prognostic capacity of transvaginally measured mid-trimester CL for spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth (< 37 weeks) using likelihood ratios (LR) and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. We calculated numbers needed to screen to prevent one preterm birth assuming different treatment effects. Main outcome measures were preterm birth <32, <34 and <37 weeks.\nWe studied 11,943 women, of whom 666 (5.6%) delivered preterm (464 (3.9%) spontaneous and 202 (1.7%) iatrogenic). Mean CL was 44.1 mm (SD 7.8 mm). In nulliparous women, the LRs for spontaneous preterm birth varied between 27 (95%CI, 7.7-95) for a CL ≤ 20 mm, and 2.0 (95%C, 1.6-2.5) for a CL between 30 and 35 mm. For low risk multiparous women, these LRs were 37 (95%CI, 7.5-182) and 1.5 (95%CI, 0.97-2.2), respectively. Using a cut-off for CL ≤30 mm, 28 (6.0%) of 464 women with spontaneous preterm birth were identified. The number needed to screen to prevent one case of preterm birth was 618 in nulliparous women and 1417 for low risk multiparous women (40% treatment effect, cut-off 30 mm).\nIn women at low risk of preterm birth, cervical length predicts spontaneous preterm birth. However, its isolated use as a screening tool has limited value due to low sensitivity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nThis article is protected by copyright.
