{"id":"327867799_Deep_Neural_Networks_and_Decision_Tree_Classifier_for_Visual_Question_Answering_in_the_Medical_Domain","abstract":"This paper presents our contribution to the problem of visual question\nanswering in the medical domain using a combination of deep neural networks\nand the Decision tree classifier. In our proposed approach we consider\nthe task of visual question answering as multi-label classification problem,\nwhere each label corresponds to a unique word in the answer dictionary that\nwas built from the training set.","authors":["Imane Allaouzi","M.
