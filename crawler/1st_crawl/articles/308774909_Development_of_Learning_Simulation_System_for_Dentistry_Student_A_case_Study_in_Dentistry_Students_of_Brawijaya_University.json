{"id":"308774909_Development_of_Learning_Simulation_System_for_Dentistry_Student_A_case_Study_in_Dentistry_Students_of_Brawijaya_University","abstract":"The development of science and technology, particularly computer science, has affected many fields including dentistry. Several learning methods were applied to develop the clinical reasoning of prospective dentists. This clinical reasoning has not yet facilitated the evaluation of student clinical reasoning. This study was aimed at designing a learning evaluation system which could measure the level of clinical reasoning of prospective dentists and provide evaluation assistance in clinical reasoning test of prospective dentist at Faculty of Dentistry Brawijaya University (FKGUB), Malang. An Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) method was used. A CodeIgniter (CI) framework with Model, View, Controller (MVC) model was used. Results showed that 91% students received some learning and clinical reasoning test by using PINUS. This indicated that students felt comfortable and they enjoyed using PINUS as it was easy to follow. In addition, PINUS could also develop investigation and determine clinical reasoning performance of the students.","authors":["Nurul Qamariyah Ririn","Irman Hermadi","Agus Buono"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["276198111_Black_Box_and_White_Box_Testing_Techniques_-_A_Literature_Review","275543438_Knowledge_Management_Integrated_Web_based_Course_Tutoring_System","266292869_Intelligent_Avatar_on_E-Learning_Using_Facial_Expression_an_Haptic","265388516_Acquisition_of_knowledge_generic_skills_and_attitudes_through_problem-based_learning_Student_perspectives_of_a_hybrid_curriculum","257350860_Innovative_technology-_based_interventions_for_autism_spectrum_disorders_A_meta-_analysis","49597308_Cost_and_Benefit_of_Information_Search_using_Two_Different_Strategies","314067679_Software_Testing_and_Quality_Assurance_Theory_and_Practice","222645388_Interactive_simulated_patient_-_An_advanced_tool_for_student-activated_learning_in_medicine_and_healthcare","24247517_Virtual_patients_A_critical_literature_review_and_proposed_next_steps","23982659_Web-based_virtual_patients_in_dentistry_Factors_influencing_the_use_of_cases_in_the_Web-SP_system"]}
