{"id":"319328021_Wireless_Access_for_Ultra-Reliable_Low-Latency_Communication_Principles_and_Building_Blocks","abstract":"Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is an important new feature brought by 5G, with a potential to support a vast set of applications that rely on mission-critical links. In this article, we first discuss the principles for supporting URLLC in the perspective to the traditional assumptions and models applied in communication/information theory. We then discuss how this principles are applied in various elements of the system design, such as use of various diversity sources, design of packets and access protocols. Important messages are that there is a need to optimize the transmission of signaling information, as well as for a lean use of various sources of diversity.","authors":["Petar Popovski","Jimmy Jessen Nielsen","Čedomir Stefanović","E. de Carvalho"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Network 32(2)","DOI:10.1109/MNET.2018.1700258"],"references":["315100726_Revisiting_Frequency_Reuse_towards_Supporting_Ultra-Reliable_Ubiquitous-Rate_Communication","302384187_Downlink_Transmission_of_Short_Packets_Framing_and_Control_Information_Revisited","224132864_Channel_Coding_Rate_in_the_Finite_Blocklength_Regime","322004537_Short_Codes_with_Mismatched_Channel_State_Information_A_Case_Study","321122816_On_a_User-Centric_Base_Station_Cooperation_Scheme_for_Reliable_Communications","316905864_Feasibility_of_large_antenna_arrays_towards_low_latency_ultra_reliable_communication","306154155_How_Smart_Connected_Products_are_Transforming_Companies","304296943_A_Flexible_Frame_Structure_for_5G_Wide_Area","304163765_Design_and_Performance_Analysis_of_Non-Coherent_Detection_Systems_with_Massive_Receiver_Arrays","13988269_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication"]}
