{"id":"26416053_Occupational_overuse_syndrome_among_keyboard_users_in_Mauritius","abstract":"Ergonomics is a very important factor that cannot be over looked in the information technology working environment. This study was undertaken to assess reporting of occupational overuse syndrome (OOS) among keyboard users in Mauritius. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out among 362 computer users. Two hundred completed questionnaires were returned and data analyzed. The main findings from the present work showed symptoms such as eye problems and lower back, neck and shoulder pain were common among computer users. Severity of pain increased with number of hours of computer use at work. Reporting of OOS was higher among females. In conclusion, it is proposed that computer users need to be provided with an ergonomically conducive environment as well as to be educated and trained with respect to OOS. Implementation of such program(s) will go a long way towards preventing appearance of OOS symptoms among the young population currently engaged in the IT sector in Mauritius.","authors":["Anwar Hussein Subratty","F Korumtollee"],"meta":["May 2005Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 9(2)","DOI:10.4103/0019-5278.16745"],"references":["11945902_Computer_terminal_work_and_the_benefit_of_microbreaks","8907517_Perceptions_of_occupational_hazards_amongst_office_workers_at_the_Obafemi_Awolowo_University_Ile-Ife","247731653_Sick_Building_Syndrome_in_Mauritius_Are_Symptoms_Associated_with_the_Office_Environment","230754159_Prevalence_of_overuse_injury_among_keyboard_operators_Characteristics_of_the_job_the_operator_and_the_work_environment","16494820_Occupational_repetition_strain_injuries_Guidelines_for_diagnosis_and_management","8055174_An_exploratory_study_of_the_relationship_between_biomechanical_factors_and_right-arm_musculoskeletal_discomfort_and_fatigue_in_a_VDT_data-entry_task"]}
