{"id":"312115246_On_input-to-state-stability_and_integral_input-to-state-stability_for_parabolic_boundary_control_systems","abstract":"This work contributes to the recently intensified study of input-to-state stability for infinite-dimensional systems. The focus is laid on the relation between input-to-state stability and integral input-to-state stability for linear systems with a possibly unbounded control operator. The main result is that for parabolic diagonal systems both notions coincide, even in the setting of inputs in L âˆž , and a simple criterion is derived.","authors":["Birgit Jacob","Robert Nabiullin","Jonathan Partington","Felix Schwenninger"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/CDC.2016.7798600","Conference: 2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","Project: Input-to-state stability and stabilization of distributed parameter systems"],"references":["336085816_Restatements_of_input-to-state_stability_in_infinite_dimensions_what_goes_wrong","308807253_Infinite-Dimensional_Input-to-State_Stability_and_Orlicz_Spaces","304411215_A_note_on_input-to-state_stability_of_linear_and_bilinear_infinite-dimensional_systems","281667292_Integral_input-to-state_stability_of_bilinear_infinite-dimensional_systems","266856548_Construction_of_Lyapunov_Functions_for_Interconnected_Parabolic_Systems_An_iISS_Approach","301897781_ISS_In_Different_Norms_For_1-D_Parabolic_Pdes_With_Boundary_Disturbances","284358903_Local_input-to-state_stability_Characterizations_and_counterexamples","268651753_Theory_and_application_of_infinite_series_Transl_from_the_2nd_ed_and_revised_in_accordance_with_the_fourth_by_R_C_H_Young","266983171_Stabilization_of_Well-Posed_Infinite-Dimensional_Systems_by_Dynamic_Sampled-Data_Feedback","266910047_Input_to_state_stability_Basic_concepts_and_results"]}
