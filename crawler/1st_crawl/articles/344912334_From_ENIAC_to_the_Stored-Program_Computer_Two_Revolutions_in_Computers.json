{"id":"344912334_From_ENIAC_to_the_Stored-Program_Computer_Two_Revolutions_in_Computers","abstract":"This chapter discusses two main revolutions in the computer field. The first was the employment of vacuum tubes to make a fast, reliable, powerful, general-purpose computer. This development began with John Atanasoff's slow, special-purpose electronic computer called ENIAC. The second revolution was the stored-program computer. The ENIAC necessarily used electromechanical equipment for input and output, and thereby tested the relative merits of the two technologies for computing. It is claimed that the arithmetic design of ENIAC was influenced mainly by two kinds of calculators: mechanical desk calculators, electrically powered and hand operated; and electromechanical card operated IBM machines. During 1946, the final design and construction stage of the development of the stored-program computer was beginning. It is suggested that von Neumann was the first to see and exploit the fact that when orders or instructions are stored in a high-speed readâ€“write electronic memory, they can be manipulated arithmetically and modified by the machine. His variable address EDVAC code was the basis of the modern computer software revolution.","authors":["ARTHUR W.
