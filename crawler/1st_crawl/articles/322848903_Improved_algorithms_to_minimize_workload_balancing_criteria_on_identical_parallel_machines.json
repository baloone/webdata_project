{"id":"322848903_Improved_algorithms_to_minimize_workload_balancing_criteria_on_identical_parallel_machines","abstract":"In Schwerdfeger and Walter (2016), we proposed a subset sum based improvement procedure (denoted by LS) for solving the problem of minimizing the normalized sum of squared workload deviations on m identical machines. In its core, the algorithm builds on an exact procedure (denoted by WB3) for the case of m=3 machines. Although this approach proved to be superior to existing procedures in terms of solution quality, we identified room for further improvements.\nBuilding upon our prior work, in this follow-up paper we suggest an enhanced version of WB3 that leads to a significant speed-up of several orders of magnitude and we considerably improve on the performance of LS on difficult instances where the ratio of the number of jobs to the number of machines is small. Moreover, we investigate a simple surrogate balancing measure that can also be optimized by our algorithms with only a slight modification. Results of a comprehensive computational study on a large set of benchmark as well as random test instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved algorithms.","authors":["Stefan Schwerdfeger","Rico Walter"],"meta":["May 2018Computers & Operations Research 93","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2018.01.018"],"references":["257919068_Workload_balancing_in_identical_parallel_machine_scheduling_using_a_mathematical_programming_method","301276744_A_fast_and_effective_subset_sum_based_improvement_procedure_for_workload_balancing_on_identical_parallel_machines","265129782_A_note_on_minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_squared_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","222029329_Minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_square_for_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","220471175_A_new_heuristic_for_workload_balancing_on_identical_parallel_machines_and_a_statistical_perspective_on_the_workload_balancing_criteria"]}
