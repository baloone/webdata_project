{"id":"317633533_Deciding_First-Order_Properties_of_Nowhere_Dense_Graphs","abstract":"Nowhere dense graph classes, introduced by Nešet&rcaron;il and Ossona de Mendez [2010, 2011], form a large variety of classes of “sparse graphs” including the class of planar graphs, actually all classes with excluded minors, and also bounded degree graphs and graph classes of bounded expansion.\nWe show that deciding properties of graphs definable in first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on nowhere dense graph classes (parameterized by the length of the input formula). At least for graph classes closed under taking subgraphs, this result is optimal: it was known before that for all classes C of graphs closed under taking subgraphs, if deciding first-order properties of graphs in C is fixed-parameter tractable, then C must be nowhere dense (under a reasonable complexity theoretic assumption).\nAs a by-product, we give an algorithmic construction of sparse neighborhood covers for nowhere dense graphs. This extends and improves previous constructions of neighborhood covers for graph classes with excluded minors. At the same time, our construction is considerably simpler than those.\nOur proofs are based on a new game-theoretic characterization of nowhere dense graphs that allows for a recursive version of locality-based algorithms on these classes. On the logical side, we prove a “rank-preserving” version of Gaifman’s locality theorem.","authors":["Martin Grohe","Stephan Kreutzer","Sebastian Siebertz"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of the ACM 64(3):1-32","DOI:10.1145/3051095"],"references":["305871333_Colouring_and_Covering_Nowhere_Dense_Graphs","275055641_FO_Model_Checking_on_Posets_of_Bounded_Width","266222976_Evaluation_of_an_MSO-solver","261160105_Meta_Kernelization","260302571_Methods_for_Algorithmic_Meta_Theorems","228822044_The_parameterized_complexity_of_relational_database_queries_and_an_improved_characterization_of_W_1","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","221498530_Logspace_Versions_of_the_Theorems_of_Bodlaender_and_Courcelle","221443131_Approximation_Schemes_for_First-Order_Definable_Optimisation_Problems","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220544188_Strong-Diameter_Decompositions_of_Minor_Free_Graphs","220315971_First_Order_Properties_on_Nowhere_Dense_Structures","45897887_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Complexity_of_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic","45864029_Domination_Problems_in_Nowhere-Dense_Classes_of_Graphs","45862822_On_Brambles_Grid-Like_Minors_and_Parameterized_Intractability_of_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic","24013953_Algorithmic_Meta-Theorems","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","312703888_An_application_of_games_to_the_completness_problem_for_formalized_theories","309874388_Meta_Kernelization","308847274_FO_Model_Checking_on_Posets_of_Bounded_Width","286329112_Embedding_and_canonizing_graphs_of_bounded_genus_in_logspace","285105957_Logic_and_Automata_History_and_Perspectives","284241226_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_the_Graph_Minor_Decomposition_-_Logic_meets_Structural_Graph_Theory-","268671230_Algorithmic_Meta_Theorems_for_Sparse_Graph_Classes","268552189_On_Local_and_Non-Local_Properties","268248842_Sur_quelques_classifications_des_systems_de_relations","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","265351411_Mathematical_logic_Transl_from_the_German_by_Ann_S_Ferebee","257048334_Constant-factor_approximation_of_the_domination_number_in_sparse_graphs","222663470_Grad_and_classes_with_bounded_expansion_II_Algorithmic_aspects","222569763_Machine-based_methods_in_parameterized_complexity_theory","222536651_Homomorphism_Preservation_on_Quasi-Wide_Classes","222470961_Optimization_Approximation_and_Complexity_Classes","222425204_Colouring_graphs_with_bounded_generalized_colouring_number","221499527_Deciding_First-Order_Properties_for_Sparse_Graphs","221351424_Logic_graphs_and_algorithms","221343648_Improved_sparse_covers_for_graphs_excluding_a_fixed_minor","220567158_On_the_fixed_parameter_complexity_of_graph_enumeration_problems_definable_in_monadic_second-order_logic","220533870_Orderings_on_Graphs_and_Game_Coloring_Number","220296944_On_nowhere_dense_graphs","220138798_Logic_Graphs_and_Algorithms","220081923_The_Grad_of_a_Graph_and_Classes_with_Bounded_Expansion","200034146_Graph_Rewriting_An_Algebraic_and_Logic_Approach","4263846_Locally_Excluding_a_Minor","2562889_Linear_Time_Computable_Problems_and_First-Order_Descriptions","2250874_On_the_Fixed_Parameter_Complexity_of_Graph_Enumeration_Problems_Definable_in_Monadic_Second_Order_Logic","1961505_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_Definability_and_Model-Checking","1954925_Deciding_first-order_properties_of_locally_tree-decomposable_structures"]}
