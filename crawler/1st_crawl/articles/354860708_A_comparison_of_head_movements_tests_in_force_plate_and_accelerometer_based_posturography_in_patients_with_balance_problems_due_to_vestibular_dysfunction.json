The study group included 38 patients (age 50.6; SD 11.6) with unilateral vestibular weakness (UV) and 65 healthy volunteers (48.7; SD 11.5). HS tests were performed simultaneously on the force plate and with MediPost sensor attached at L4. Four conditions applied: eyes open/closed, firm/foam. The tests were performed twice, with the head moving at the frequency of 0.3 Hz (HS 0.3) and 0.6 Hz (HS 0.6). Mean sway velocity was significantly lower for MediPost than force plate in 4th condition both in UV and healthy group. For HS 0.3 the differences between devices were marginal; the highest sensitivity (87%) and specificity (95%) were in 4th condition. For HS 0.6 MediPost revealed lower sensitivity than force plate although the surface parameter improved results. MediPost IMU device and force platform posturography revealed a similar ability to differentiate between patients with balance problems in course of vestibular pathology and healthy participants, despite the differences observed between measuring methods. In some tests surface parameter may be more appropriate than sway velocity in improving MediPost sensitivity.","authors":["Magdalena Janc","Mariola Sliwinska-Kowalska","Magdalena Jozefowicz-Korczynska","Pawel Marciniak"],"meta":["September 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):19094","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-98695-1"],"references":["350165109_Posturography_with_head_movements_in_the_assessment_of_balance_in_chronic_unilateral_vestibular_lesions","337130263_Evaluation_of_Agreement_Between_Static_Posturography_Methods_Employing_Tensometers_and_Inertial_Sensors","335955165_Wearable_Inertial_Sensors_to_Assess_Standing_Balance_A_Systematic_Review","331968039_Reliability_Validity_and_Utility_of_Inertial_Sensor_Systems_for_Postural_Control_Assessment_in_Sport_Science_and_Medicine_Applications_A_Systematic_Review","317014171_Body-worn_triaxial_accelerometer_coherence_and_reliability_related_to_static_posturography_in_unilateral_vestibular_failure_Impiego_degli_accelerometri_triassiali_nel_deficit_vestibolare_unilaterale_a","304143730_Modified_head_shake_sensory_organization_test_Sensitivity_and_specificity","275049752_Diagnostic_criteria_for_Meniere's_disease","344512307_Measuring_agreement_in_method_comparison_studies","331468181_Screening_for_Vestibular_Disorders_Using_the_Modified_Clinical_Test_of_Sensory_Interaction_and_Balance_and_Tandem_Walking_With_Eyes_Closed","321434971_The_Effect_of_Peripheral_Vestibular_Recovery_on_Improvements_in_Vestibulo-ocular_Reflexes_and_Balance_Control_After_Acute_Unilateral_Peripheral_Vestibular_Loss","251112124_The_Relationship_between_the_COP-COM_Variable_and_the_Horizontal_Acceleration_of_the_Body_in_Postural_Sway_Falling_and_Walking","230721640_ISway_A_sensitive_valid_and_reliable_measure_of_postural_control","222307045_Computing_the_COM_from_the_COP_in_postural_sway_movements","251235438_Standing_Balance_Tests_for_Screening_People_With_Vestibular_Impairments","236604665_Statistics_Corner_A_guide_to_appropriate_use_of_Correlation_coefficient_in_medical_research"]}
