{"id":"235716664_CompaRNA_A_server_for_continuous_benchmarking_of_automated_methods_for_RNA_secondary_structure_prediction","abstract":"We present a continuous benchmarking approach for the assessment of RNA secondary structure prediction methods implemented\nin the CompaRNA web server. As of 3 October 2012, the performance of 28 single-sequence and 13 comparative methods has been\nevaluated on RNA sequences/structures released weekly by the Protein Data Bank. We also provide a static benchmark generated\non RNA 2D structures derived from the RNAstrand database. Benchmarks on both data sets offer insight into the relative performance\nof RNA secondary structure prediction methods on RNAs of different size and with respect to different types of structure.\nAccording to our tests, on the average, the most accurate predictions obtained by a comparative approach are generated by\nCentroidAlifold, MXScarna, RNAalifold and TurboFold. On the average, the most accurate predictions obtained by single-sequence\nanalyses are generated by CentroidFold, ContextFold and IPknot. The best comparative methods typically outperform the best\nsingle-sequence methods if an alignment of homologous RNA sequences is available. This article presents the results of our\nbenchmarks as of 3 October 2012, whereas the rankings presented online are continuously updated. We will gladly include new\nprediction methods and new measures of accuracy in the new editions of CompaRNA benchmarks.","authors":["Tomasz Puton","Lukasz P Kozlowski","Kristian M Rother","Janusz Bujnicki"],"meta":["February 2013Nucleic Acids Research 42(8)","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkt101","SourcePubMed"],"references":["273462703_Rich_Parameterization_Improves_RNA_Structure_Prediction","232766280_MODOMICS_a_database_of_RNA_modification_pathways-2013_update","225074487_RNASTAR_An_RNA_STructural_Alignment_Repository_that_provides_insight_into_the_evolution_of_natural_and_artificial_RNAs","221857653_RNA-Puzzles_A_CASP-like_evaluation_of_RNA_three-dimensional_structure_prediction","329267680_HotKnots_heuristic_prediction_of_RNA_secondary_structures_including_pseudoknots","295169752_RNAstructure_Software_for_RNA_Secondary_Structure_Prediction_and_Analysis","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","247957623_The_Protein_Data_Bank_Nucleic_Acids_Research","238831754_Simultaneous_Solution_of_the_RNA_Folding_Alignment_and_Protosequence_Problems","233420476_The_Protein_Data_Bank"]}
