{"id":"340490396_Neural_ODEs_as_the_Deep_Limit_of_Resnets_with_Constant_Weights","abstract":"In this paper, we prove that, in the deep limit, the stochastic gradient descent on a ResNet type deep neural network, where each layer shares the same weight matrix, converges to the stochastic gradient descent for a Neural ODE and that the corresponding value/loss functions converge. Our result gives, in the context of minimization by stochastic gradient descent, a theoretical foundation for considering Neural ODEs as the deep limit of ResNets. Our proof is based on certain decay estimates for associated Fokker–Planck equations.","authors":["Benny Avelin","Kaj Nyström"],"meta":["April 2020Analysis and Applications 19(4)","DOI:10.1142/S0219530520400023"],"references":["333760642_Universality_of_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","329636253_A_mean-field_optimal_control_formulation_of_deep_learning","316189536_Deep_Relaxation_partial_differential_equations_for_optimizing_deep_neural_networks","309484388_Statistical_Inference_for_Model_Parameters_in_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","256926001_Stochastic_First-_and_Zeroth-Order_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Stochastic_Programming","346678324_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","328522578_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Performs_Variational_Inference_Converges_to_Limit_Cycles_for_Deep_Networks","318489182_Theoretical_Insights_Into_the_Optimization_Landscape_of_Over-Parameterized_Shallow_Neural_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","279341620_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Inequalities","273604795_On_Uniqueness_of_a_Probability_Solution_to_the_Cauchy_Problem_for_the_Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov_Equation","266434599_Dirichlet_forms_Lectures_given_at_the_1st_session_of_the_Centro_Internazionale_Matematico_Estivo_CIME_held_in_Varenne_Italy_June_8-19_1992","266005492_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Large_Deviations","265444140_Second_Order_Parabolic_Differential_Equations","257607024_On_uniqueness_problems_related_to_the_Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov_equation_for_measures","239230352_Topics_in_Optimal_Transportation_Theory","228624441_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_Solutions_to_Fokker-Planck_Type_Equations_with_Irregular_Coefficients","224011016_Optimal_transport_--_Old_and_new"]}
