{"id":"263624422_Real-Time_Heart_Rate_Monitoring_System_based_on_Ring-Type_Pulse_Oximeter_Sensor","abstract":"With the continuous aging of the populations in developed countries, the medical requirements of the aged are expected to increase. In this paper, a ring-type pulse oximeter finger sensor and a 24-hour ambulatory heart rate monitoring system for the aged are presented. We also demonstrate the feasibility of extracting accurate heart rate variability measurements from photoelectric plethysmography signals gathered using a ring-type pulse oximeter sensor attached to the finger. We designed the heart rate sensor using a CPU with built-in ZigBee stack for simplicity and low power consumption. We also analyzed the various distorted signals caused by motion artifacts using a FFT, and designed an algorithm using a least squares estimator to calibrate the signals for better accuracy.","authors":["Seung-Min Park","Jun-Yeup Kim","Kwangeun Ko","In-Hun Jang"],"meta":["March 2013Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology 8(2)","DOI:10.5370/JEET.2013.8.2.376"],"references":["50303923_A_Real-time_Heart_Rate_Analysis_for_a_Remote_Millimeter_Wave_I-Q_Sensor","3885682_Artifact-resistant_power-efficient_design_of_finger-ring_plethysmographic_sensors_II_Prototyping_and_benchmarking","3749194_A_twenty-four_hour_tele-nursing_system_using_a_ring_sensor","285217373_Volumetric_blood_flow_measurements","224353931_Ring_sensor_and_heart_rate_monitoring_system_for_sensor_network_applications","223034866_Web-based_remote_human_pulse_monitoring_system_with_intelligent_data_analysis_for_home_health_care","41404758_Agents_applied_in_health_care_A_review","23223592_A_longitudinal_study_of_usability_in_health_care_Does_time_heal","7276737_A_Method_for_Automatic_Identification_of_Reliable_Heart_Rates_Calculated_from_ECG_and_PPG_Waveforms","6532223_Extracting_breathing_rate_information_from_a_wearable_reflectance_pulse_oximeter_sensor"]}
