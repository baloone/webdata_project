This paper presents the first systematic study of the most commonly used alignment programs\nusing BAliBASE benchmark alignments as test cases. Even below the ‘twilight zone’ at 10–20% residue identity, the best programs\nwere capable of correctly aligning on average 47% of the residues. We show that iterative algorithms often offer improved\nalignment accuracy though at the expense of computation time. A notable exception was the effect of introducing a single divergent\nsequence into a set of closely related sequences, causing the iteration to diverge away from the best alignment. Global alignment\nprograms generally performed better than local methods, except in the presence of large N/C-terminal extensions and internal\ninsertions. In these cases, a local algorithm was more successful in identifying the most conserved motifs. This study enables\nus to propose appropriate alignment strategies, depending on the nature of a particular set of sequences. The employment of\nmore than one program based on different alignment techniques should significantly improve the quality of automatic protein\nsequence alignment methods. The results also indicate guidelines for improvement of alignment algorithms.","authors":["Julie Thompson","Frédéric Plewniak","Olivier Poch"],"meta":["July 1999Nucleic Acids Research 27(13):2682-2690","DOI:10.1093/nar/27.13.2682","SourceDBLP"],"references":["273590255_Basic_local_alignment_search_tool_BLAST","20923774_Basic_Local_Aligment_Search_Tool","243677972_A_Strategy_For_The_Rapid_Multiple_Alignment_Of_Protein_Sequences","238355667_The_Use_of_Ranks_to_Avoid_the_Assumption_of_Normality_Implicit_in_the_Analysis_of_Variance","51336082_Automated_protein_sequence_database_classification_I_Integration_of_compositional_similarity_search_local_similarity_search_and_multiple_sequence_alignment","51315941_EbEST_An_Automated_Tool_Using_Expressed_Sequence_Tags_to_Delineate_Gene_Structure","23367418_Probability_Tables_for_Individual_Comparisons_by_Ranking_Methods","21524777_Pattern-induced_multi-sequence_alignment_PIMA_algorithm_secondary_structure-dependent_gap_penalties_for_comparative_protein_modelling","20038337_Progressive_sequence_alignment_as_a_prerequisite_to_correct_phylogenetic_trees","20007026_A_flexible_method_to_align_large_numbers_of_biological_sequences"]}
