{"id":"286594369_Color_Transfer_Using_Probabilistic_Moving_Least_Squares","abstract":"This paper introduces a new color transfer method which is a process of transferring color of an image to match the color of another image of the same scene. The color of a scene may vary from image to image because the photographs are taken at different times, with different cameras, and under different camera settings. To solve for a full nonlinear and nonparametric color mapping in the 3D RGB color space, we propose a scattered point interpolation scheme using moving least squares and strengthen it with a probabilistic modeling of the color transfer in the 3D color space to deal with mis-alignments and noise. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method over previous color transfer methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, our framework can be applied for various instances of color transfer such as transferring color between different camera models, camera settings, and illumination conditions, as well as for video color transfers.","authors":["Youngbae Hwang","Joon-Young Lee","Inso Kweon","Seon Joo Kim"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2014.427","Conference: 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","Project: Color Transfer"],"references":["221364690_Performance_Evaluation_of_Color_Correction_Approaches_for_Automatic_Multi-view_Image_and_Video_Stitching","221364011_Unsupervised_local_color_correction_for_coarsely_registered_images","221111248_Ensuring_Color_Consistency_across_Multiple_Cameras","220518215_Color_Transfer_between_Images","220184711_Robust_Moving_Least-Squares_Fitting_With_Sharp_Features","42345292_Daisy_An_Efficient_Dense_Descriptor_Applied_to_Wide_Baseline_Stereo","5575033_Robust_Radiometric_Calibration_and_Vignetting_Correction","4193994_N-Dimensional_Probability_Density_Function_Transfer_and_its_Application_to_Colour_Transfer","4156245_Local_Color_Transfer_via_Probabilistic_Segmentation_by_Expectation-Maximization","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","312993877_Surfaces_generated_by_moving_least_squares_methods","225133245_Automatic_Panoramic_Image_Stitching_using_Invariant_Features","224254782_Learning_photographic_global_tonal_adjustment_with_a_database_of_inputoutput_image_pairs","221867589_A_New_In-Camera_Imaging_Model_for_Color_Computer_Vision_and_Its_Application","221305131_WT_SIFT_flow_dense_correspondence_across_different_scenes_In_ECCV","221111438_Landmark-Based_Sparse_Color_Representations_for_Color_Transfer","221110916_Piecewise-consistent_Color_Mappings_of_Images_Acquired_Under_Various_Conditions","220184559_Image_deformation_using_Moving_Least_Squares","14016749_Bayean_color_constancy","8103225_Tensor_voting_for_image_correction_by_global_and_local_intensity_alignment","6211238_Soft_Color_Segmentation_and_Its_Applications","3328271_Superresolution_and_noise_filtering_using_moving_least_squares"]}
