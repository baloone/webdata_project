While efforts have been made to develop inclusive curricula, little research has focused on ways teachers apply curricula in their classrooms to promote inclusion.\n\nObjective\nTo understand the challenges faced in facilitating an open-ended unit and the pedagogical strategies enacted to address those challenges, we analyze the self-reported teaching practices that experienced teachers developed in their implementation of a constructionist electronic textiles unit in Exploring Computer Science.\n\nMethod\nWe inductively analyzed and coded 17 experienced teachers’ weekly surveys and post-interviews.\n\nFindings\nTeachers leveraged local resources and contexts to adapt classroom activities as well as developed new perspectives on computing as ways to foster inclusivity.\n\nImplications\nWe propose further opportunities for CS teachers to consciously reflect and draw upon the assets and funds of knowledge of their students’ communities when facilitating open-ended, inclusive activities.","authors":["Mia Shaw","Deborah A.
