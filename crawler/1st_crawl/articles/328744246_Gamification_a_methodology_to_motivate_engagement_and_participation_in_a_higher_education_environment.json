{"id":"328744246_Gamification_a_methodology_to_motivate_engagement_and_participation_in_a_higher_education_environment","abstract":"Due to technological evolution and the advent of mobile computing, it has become increasingly challenging to engage students in the classroom, gain their attention and involve them in some activities. In this context, the objective of this work is to stimulate students' engagement in class through the use of gamification, creating metrics to evaluate their participation and informing their progress during the semester. In order to carry out such evaluation, a spreadsheet was developed in which students were awarded with points for attendance and participation in each class throughout the semester. A survey was conducted with students to evaluate such method. As results it is possible to perceive a greater interest of the students to participate in the classes, a significant increase in the presence, and a fun and healthy competition among the students.","authors":["Lauro André Ribeiro","Thaisa Silva","Andréa Quadrado Mussi"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["322828082_Enhancing_student_learning_experience_with_technology-mediated_gamification_An_empirical_study","274252092_Enhancing_the_CS1_Student_Experience_with_Gamification","270273830_Gamification_in_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","264977730_A_Systematic_Mapping_on_Gamification_Applied_to_Education","259841647_Defining_Gamification_-_A_Service_Marketing_Perspective","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","228799919_Game2Learn_improving_the_motivation_of_CS1_students","221518895_Gamification_Using_game_design_elements_in_non-gaming_contexts","46706288_International_Handbook_Of_Survey_Methodology_2008","235316599_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_1","230854793_The_Gamification_of_Learning_and_Instruction_Game-based_Methods_and_Strategies_for_Training_and_Eduction"]}
