{"id":"327000565_Hybrid_LSTMMaxEnt_Networks_for_Arabic_Syntactic_Diacritics_Restoration","abstract":"Restoring syntactic diacritics is an essential task for Arabic text to speech systems. Syntactic diacritic mark is defined as the last diacritic mark of the stem of a whitespace delimited word. It is usually assigned based on the syntax of the Arabic language. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a tagging problem and propose the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to assign the syntactic diacritics for a sentence of Arabic words. These LSTM networks were augmented with sparse direct connections between the input and the output layers of the tagger (i.e. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) connections). On the Arabic tree bank task, this hybrid LSTM/MaxEnt approach achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art systems.","authors":["Yasser Hifny"],"meta":["August 2018Signal Processing Letters, IEEE PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LSP.2018.2865098"],"references":["318738613_Arabic_Diacritization_Stats_Rules_and_Hacks","312331309_Word_Embeddings_and_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Arabic_Sentiment_Classification","306093553_End-to-end_Sequence_Labeling_via_Bi-directional_LSTM-CNNs-CRF","301446042_Arabic_Diacritization_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","273918305_Automatic_diacritization_of_Arabic_text_using_recurrent_neural_networks","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","241637478_Strategies_for_training_large_scale_neural_network_language_models","234798866_An_HMM_approach_to_vowel_restoration_in_Arabic_and_Hebrew","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","233735067_A_Hybrid_Approach_for_Building_Arabic_Diacritizer","233730646_On_the_difficulty_of_training_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","228693973_The_penn_arabic_treebank_Building_a_large-scale_annotated_arabic_corpus","221080352_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks_for_Improved_Phoneme_Classification_and_Recognition","220816874_Arabic_Diacritization_through_Full_Morphological_Tagging","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","206005916_A_Statistical_Method_for_Adding_Case_Diacritics_for_Arabic_Text","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","322516492_Investigating_hybrid_approaches_for_Arabic_text_diacritization_with_recurrent_neural_networks","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","319770348_Teaching_Machines_to_Read_and_Comprehend","319769994_A_Theoretically_Grounded_Application_of_Dropout_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","318741532_A_Layered_Language_Model_based_Hybrid_Approach_to_Automatic_Full_Diacritization_of_Arabic","306094228_A_Thorough_Examination_of_the_CNNDaily_Mail_Reading_Comprehension_Task","305880532_A_multi-layered_approach_for_Arabic_text_diacritization","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","285270985_Named_entity_recognition_with_bidirectional_LSTM-SNNs","283806596_End-To-end_learning_of_semantic_role_labeling_using_recurrent_neural_networks","280912107_Bidirectional_LSTM-CRF_Models_for_Sequence_Tagging","278048272_Teaching_Machines_to_Read_and_Comprehend","271643271_Deep_Learning_Framework_with_Confused_Sub-Set_Resolution_Architecture_for_Automatic_Arabic_Diacritization","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","261037881_Restoration_of_Arabic_diacritics_using_dynamic_programming","255687082_ARABTALK_An_implementation_for_arabic_text_to_speech_system","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","224371235_Speech_Recognition_Using_Augmented_Conditional_Random_Fields","224123580_A_Stochastic_Arabic_Diacritizer_Based_on_a_Hybrid_of_Factorized_and_Unfactorized_Textual_Features","220873450_Maximum_Entropy_Based_Restoration_of_Arabic_Diacritics","38412697_Arabic_diacritization_using_weighted_finite-state_transducers","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data"]}
