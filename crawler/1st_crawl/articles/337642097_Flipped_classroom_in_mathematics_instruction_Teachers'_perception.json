{"id":"337642097_Flipped_classroom_in_mathematics_instruction_Teachers'_perception","abstract":"Student-centered learning paradigm requires a learning model which is able to facilitate the students constructing their knowledge actively. The flipped classroom is a student-centered learning model that integrates technology in its implementation. This study aims to describe the teachers’ perception about the use of the flipped classroom model in mathematics instruction. The data were collected through an interview and were analyzed using qualitative methods. The subject of this study were five teachers from public and private schools in Yogyakarta. The result showed that the flipped classroom: (i) can motivate and make students active in learning mathematics; (ii) can train students’ critical thinking skill; (iii) can train students’ problem-solving skill. Besides, the use of the flipped classroom in mathematics instruction would be optimal when it is combined with the other learning methods, especially for the new learning topics that require a prior conceptual understanding.","authors":["V Rachmawati","Wahyu Setyaningrum","H Retnawati"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1320(1):012088","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1320/1/012088"],"references":["339339697_A_WHITE_PAPER_BASED_ON_THE_LITERATURE_REVIEW_TITLED_A_REVIEW_OF_FLIPPED_LEARNING","334179431_Blended_Learning_Does_it_help_students_in_understanding_mathematical_concepts","318115077_Why_are_the_Mathematics_National_Examination_Items_Difficult_and_What_Is_Teachers'_Strategy_to_Overcome_It","264860703_Case_Studies_and_the_Flipped_Classroom","237292751_Reversing_the_LectureHomework_Paradigm_Using_eTEACHR_Web-based_Streaming_Video_Software","312338557_KEEFEKTIFAN_PBL_DAN_IBL_DITINJAU_DARI_PRESTASI_BELAJAR_KEMAMPUAN_REPRESENTASI_MATEMATIS_DAN_MOTIVASI_BELAJAR","234672988_Learner-Centered_Assessment_on_College_Campuses_Sifting_the_Focus_from_Teaching_to_Learning","232175343_How_learning_in_an_inverted_classroom_influences_cooperation_innovation_and_task_orientation","6690001_Where's_the_evidence_that_active_learning_works"]}
