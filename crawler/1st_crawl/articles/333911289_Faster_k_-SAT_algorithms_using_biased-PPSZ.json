{"id":"333911289_Faster_k_-SAT_algorithms_using_biased-PPSZ","abstract":"The PPSZ algorithm, due to Paturi, Pudlak, Saks and Zane, is currently the fastest known algorithm for the k-SAT problem, for every k>3. For 3-SAT, a tiny improvement over PPSZ was obtained by Hertli. We introduce a biased version of the PPSZ algorithm using which we obtain an improvement over PPSZ for every k≥ 3. For k=3 we also improve on Herli’s result and get a much more noticeable improvement over PPSZ, though still relatively small. In particular, for Unique 3-SAT, we improve the current bound from 1.308ⁿ to 1.307ⁿ.","authors":["Thomas Dueholm Hansen","Haim Kaplan","Or Zamir","Uri Zwick"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3313276.3316359","Conference: the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["222871662_Solving_satisfiability_in_less_than_2n_steps","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220543497_Randomized_Algorithms_for_3-SAT","220432358_An_improved_exponential-time_algorithm_for_k_-SAT","309729987_Tighter_Hard_Instances_for_PPSZ","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","258374345_Breaking_the_PPSZ_Barrier_for_Unique_3-SAT","228780993_A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_k_-SAT_Based_on_Limited_Local_Search_and_Restart","225182755_A_new_approach_on_solving_3-satisfiability","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220770528_An_Algorithm_for_the_SAT_Problem_for_Formulae_of_Linear_Length","220138678_Derandomization_of_PPSZ_for_unique-k-SAT","50366608_3-SAT_faster_and_simpler_-_Unique-SAT_bounds_for_PPSZ_hold_in_general","3801351_Complexity_of_k-SAT"]}
