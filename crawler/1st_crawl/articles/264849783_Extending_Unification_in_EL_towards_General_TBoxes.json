{"id":"264849783_Extending_Unification_in_EL_towards_General_TBoxes","abstract":"Unification in Description Logics (DLs) has been proposed as an inference service that can, for example, be used to de-tect redundancies in ontologies. The inexpressive Descrip-tion Logic EL is of particular interest in this context since, on the one hand, several large biomedical ontologies are de-fined using EL. On the other hand, unification in EL has recently been shown to be NP-complete, and thus of signifi-cantly lower complexity than unification in other DLs of sim-ilarly restricted expressive power. However, the unification algorithms for EL developed so far cannot deal with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). This paper makes a consid-erable step towards addressing this problem, but the GCIs our new unification algorithm can deal with still need to satisfy a certain cycle restriction.","authors":["Franz Baader","Stefan Borgwardt","Barbara Morawska"],"meta":["June 2012","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR'12)"],"references":["220896245_SAT_Encoding_of_Unification_in","220837079_Polynomial_Time_Reasoning_in_a_Description_Logic_with_Existential_Restrictions_GCI_Axioms_and_-_What_Else","220816106_Pushing_the_EL_Envelope","45923144_Unification_in_the_Description_Logic_EL","226952966_General_E-unification_with_Eager_Variable_Elimination_and_a_Nice_Cycle_Rule","222709128_Unification_of_Concept_Terms_in_Description_Logics","4175514_Proof-Theoretic_Approach_to_Description-Logic"]}
