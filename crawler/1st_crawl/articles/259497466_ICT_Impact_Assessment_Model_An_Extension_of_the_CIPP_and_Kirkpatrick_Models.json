{"id":"259497466_ICT_Impact_Assessment_Model_An_Extension_of_the_CIPP_and_Kirkpatrick_Models","abstract":"HETL Note: We are proud to present the International HET Review (IHR) December 2013 article which concludes IHR Volume 3. Dr Adedokun-Shittu and Dr Shittu â€“ prominent academics based in one of the leading Malaysian universities, introduce and discuss a new model that can be used as a framework to assess the impact of ICT in educational settings. Deeply grounded in the extant theoretical and empirical research and continuing some of the authors' prior work, the proposed model first blends two existing models, and then extends the blended model to incorporate a component that paces a special emphasis on the multi-faceted challenges related to the effective and efficient implementation of ICT in education. While still to be tested empirically the conceptual framework is seen as a comprehensive tool that addresses the most critical issues related to ICT impact evaluation, including pedagogical and technological readiness along with return on investment. You may submit your own article on the topic or you may submit a \"letter to the editor\" of less than 500 words (see the Submissions page on this portal for submission requirements).","authors":["Nafisat Afolake Adedokun-Shittu"],"meta":["December 2013"],"references":["282721976_Mind_the_Gap_New_'Literacies_Create_New_Divides","314670841_Using_a_Blended_Model_to_Improve_Delivery_of_Teacher_Education_Curriculum_in_Global_Settings","293305798_Higher_educational_institutions_and_institutional_information_and_communication_technology_ICT_policy","291021437_The_21st-century_CIPP_model_Origins_development_and_use","290536754_Writing-across-the_ITMIS_curriculum","289732251_Guiding_Our_Way_Needs_and_Motivations_of_teachers_inOnline_Learning_Modeling_Responsive_Course_Design","289114972_Critical_Issues_in_Evaluating_Education_Technology","287433400_Using_a_Blended_Model_to_Improve_Delivery_of_Teacher_Education_Curriculum_in_Global_Settings","272818279_Increasing_Student_Engagement_and_Retention_Using_Social_Technologies_Facebook_E-portfolios_and_Other_Social_Networking_Services","265922400_Models_and_Methods_for_Evaluation","262011397_The_Deployment_of_ICT_Facilities_in_Teaching_and_Learning_in_Higher_Education_A_Mixed_Method_Study_of_its_Impact_on_Lecturers_and_Students","259499904_Critical_Issues_in_Evaluating_Education_Technology","249020232_A_comparison_of_the_influence_of_government_policy_on_information_and_communications_technology_for_teacher_training_in_England_and_Northern_Ireland","242771775_Technology_Integration_Curriculum_and_Student_Achievement_A_Review_of_Scientifically_Based_Research_and_Implications_for_EasyTech","242764557_Implementing_the_Four_Levels_A_Practical_Guide_for_Effective_Evaluation_of_Training_Programs"]}
