{"id":"313220281_Evaluation_of_Internal_and_External_Validity_of_a_Virtual_Environment_for_Learning_a_Long_Procedure","abstract":"Virtual reality is a frequently used tool in vocational training. Nevertheless its efficiency has not been systematically tested. The main goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a virtual environment (VE) for learning a complex procedure in the biomedical domain. Two experiments were performed. The first one assessed internal validity of the VE, which is the effectiveness of using a VE in the process of learning a new procedure. The second one tested external validity of the VE, which is the participants’ ability to reproduce the acquired skills in a real context. We find that internal and external validity must be evaluated before using a virtual environment in long-term procedure learning. The results of such evaluations are a basis for future experiments aiming to optimize learning conditions in a VE and transferring the acquired skills in a real context.\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/7XWUiSenmEM5kVbadiYw/full","authors":["Charlotte Hoareau","Ronan Querrec","Cédric Buche","Franck Ganier"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction 33(10)","DOI:10.1080/10447318.2017.1286768"],"references":["290472684_Taking_Immersive_VR_Leap_in_Training_of_Landing_Signal_Officers","280816727_Evolution_of_cognitive_load_when_learning_a_procedure_in_a_Virtual_Environment_for_Training","272419374_Virtual_Training_Learning_Transfer_of_Assembly_Tasks","304860437_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","286135506_Anticipating_and_evaluating_the_usefulness_of_emerging_technologies_in_ergonomic_design_A_review_of_usefulness_in_design","282529313_A_multi-user_virtual_environment_to_support_students'_self-efficacy_and_interest_in_science_A_latent_growth_model_analysis","281050226_Les_interfaces_de_la_realite_virtuelle","275620827_An_Evaluation_of_a_Level-One_Instructional_Videodisc_Program","273957466_Assessing_Knowledge_Retention_of_an_Immersive_Serious_Game_vs_a_Traditional_Education_Method_in_Aviation_Safety","272787051_Cognition_in_Practice_Mind_Mathematics_and_Culture_in_Everyday_Life","264597588_Serious_games_as_new_educational_tools_How_effective_are_they_A_meta-analysis_of_recent_studies","271940475_A_Review_of_Computer-Generated_Simulation_in_the_Pedagogy_of_Cataract_Surgery_Training_and_Assessment","266316575_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation_Learning_in_Doing_Social_Cognitive_and_Computational_Perspectives","263464504_Cognition_in_Practice","263292550_Advanced_training_in_laparoscopic_abdominal_surgery_A_systematic_review"]}
