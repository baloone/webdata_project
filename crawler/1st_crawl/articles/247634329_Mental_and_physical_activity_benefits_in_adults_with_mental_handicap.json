{"id":"247634329_Mental_and_physical_activity_benefits_in_adults_with_mental_handicap","abstract":"During a 2?hour observation period after 1 hour of mental or physical activity, negative behaviour presented by 11 institutionalised adults with a mental handicap decreased by 24% and positive behaviour increased by 66%. Improvement in behaviour increased over time following mental activity, especially in men. Behavioural improvement was greatest immediately after physical activity and decreasing with time, especially in women. Fatigue can not account for these beneficial effects. 1993 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","authors":["Janet I. Brown","Arnold S.
