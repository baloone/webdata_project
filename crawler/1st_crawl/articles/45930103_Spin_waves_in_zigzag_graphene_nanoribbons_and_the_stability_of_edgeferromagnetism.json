{"id":"45930103_Spin_waves_in_zigzag_graphene_nanoribbons_and_the_stability_of_edgeferromagnetism","abstract":"We study the low energy spin excitations of zigzag graphene nanoribbons of\nvarying width. We find their energy dispersion at small wave vector to be\ndominated by antiferromagnetic correlations between the ribbon's edges, in\naccrodance with previous calculations. We point out that spin wave lifetimes\nare very long due to the semi-conducting nature of the electrically neutral\nnanoribbons. However, application of very modest gate voltages cause a\ndiscontinuous transition to a regime of finite spin wave lifetime. By further\nincreasing doping the ferromagnetic alignments along the edge become unstable\nagainst transverse spin fluctuations. This makes the experimental detection of\nferromagnetism is this class of systems very delicate, and poses a difficult\nchallenge to the possible uses of these nanoribbons as basis for spintronic\ndevices.","authors":["Francisco Culchac","Andrea Latg√©","Antonio T Costa"],"meta":["July 2010New Journal of Physics 13(3)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/13/3/033028","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261472965_Carrier_Density_and_Magnetism_in_Graphene_Zigzag_Nanoribbons","233842056_Sudden_decay_of_indirect_exchange_coupling_between_magnetic_atoms_on_carbon_nanotubes","231137958_Dynamic_interaction_between_localized_magnetic_moments_in_carbon_nanotubes","230729133_Spin_Wave_Mode_of_Edge-Localized_Magnetic_States_in_Nanographite_Zigzag_Ribbons","230729132_Peculiar_Localized_State_at_Zigzag_Graphite_Edge","243287409_Theory_of_the_spin_dynamics_of_bulk_Fe_and_ultrathin_Fe1_0_0_films","235591903_Theory_of_spin_excitations_in_Fe110_monolayers","235577514_Spin_stiffness_of_graphene_and_zigzag_graphene_nanoribbons","235526959_Theory_of_spin_excitations_in_Fe110_monolayers","233842060_Enhanced_spin-valve_effect_in_magnetically_doped_carbon_nanotubes"]}
