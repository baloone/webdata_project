{"id":"323164895_A_Tower_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_from_Infrared_Consistency","abstract":"We analyze infrared consistency conditions of 3D and 4D effective field theories with massive scalars or fermions charged under multiple $U(1)$ gauge fields. At low energies, one can integrate out the massive particles and thus obtain a one-loop effective action for the gauge fields. In the regime where charge-independent contributions to higher-derivative terms in the action are sufficiently small, it is then possible to derive constraints on the charge-to-mass ratios of the massive particles from requiring that photons propagate causally and have an analytic S-matrix. We thus find that the theories need to contain bifundamentals and satisfy a version of the weak gravity conjecture known as the convex-hull condition. Demanding self-consistency of the constraints under Kaluza-Klein compactification, we furthermore show that, for scalars, they imply a stronger version of the weak gravity conjecture in which the charge-to-mass ratios of an infinite tower of particles are bounded from below. We find that the tower must again include bifundamentals but does not necessarily have to occupy a charge (sub-)lattice.","authors":["Stefano Andriolo","Daniel Junghans","Toshifumi Noumi","Gary Shiu"],"meta":["February 2018Fortschritte der Physik 66(5)","DOI:10.1002/prop.201800020"],"references":["323392616_Infinite_Distances_in_Field_Space_and_Massless_Towers_of_States","322756377_Proof_of_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_from_Black_Hole_Entropy","321604399_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_and_Emergence_from_an_Ultraviolet_Cutoff","320867252_The_String_Landscape_the_Swampland_and_the_Missing_Corner","320033579_Testing_the_Weak_Gravity_-_Cosmic_Censorship_Connection","319622271_A_Note_on_the_WGC_Effective_Field_Theory_and_Clockwork_within_String_Theory","319255937_Flat_Monodromies_and_a_Moduli_Space_Size_Conjecture","319056703_A_swamp_of_non-SUSY_vacua","318584224_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_Multiple_Point_Principle_and_the_Standard_Model_Landscape","318559971_Constraining_the_EW_Hierarchy_from_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","317673820_Constraining_Neutrino_Masses_the_Cosmological_Constant_and_BSM_Physics_from_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","313879531_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_and_the_Axionic_Black_Hole_Paradox","310610837_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_and_Extremal_Black_Holes","305638051_Can_Gravitational_Instantons_Really_Constrain_Axion_Inflation","304758603_Tunneling_in_Axion_Monodromy","287419102_Weak_gravity_conjecture_in_the_AdSCFT_correspondence","287251019_Axion_Monodromy_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","282181413_Warping_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","274404034_On_Axionic_Field_Ranges_Loopholes_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","274263211_Winding_out_of_the_Swamp_Evading_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_with_F-term_Winding_Inflation","273704118_Fencing_in_the_Swampland_Quantum_Gravity_Constraints_on_Large_Field_Inflation","273472243_Large_Field_Inflation_from_Axion_Mixing","339750166_Relaxion_monodromy_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","319524575_Scalar_Fields_Hierarchical_UVIR_Mixing_and_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","319002297_Are_tiny_gauge_couplings_out_of_the_Swampland","318747830_Fate_of_stringy_AdS_vacua_and_the_weak_gravity_conjecture","317930495_A_Non-Perturbative_Entropic_Proof_of_a_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","316921293_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_and_Scalar_Fields","315382899_The_Swampland_Conjecture_and_F-term_Axion_Monodromy_Inflation","314437776_New_Kaluza-Klein_Instantons_and_Decay_of_AdS_Vacua","313879113_A_Chern-Simons_Pandemic","312620491_What_is_the_Magnetic_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_for_Axions","310803068_Axion_monodromy_and_the_weak_gravity_conjecture","308896473_Non-supersymmetric_AdS_and_the_Swampland","308821296_Super-Planckian_Spatial_Field_Variations_and_Quantum_Gravity","306885673_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_and_Effective_Field_Theory","304548303_Evidence_for_a_Lattice_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","304547923_The_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_in_three_dimensions","301879543_Universal_Bounds_on_Charged_States_in_2d_CFT_and_3d_Gravity","301844566_Backreacted_Axion_Field_Ranges_in_String_Theory","286950507_The_low_energy_effective_lagrangian_for_photon_interactions_in_any_dimension","285649117_Relaxion_Monodromy_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","283335358_Wormholes_Emergent_Gauge_Fields_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","283331007_Widening_the_Axion_Window_via_Kinetic_and_Stuckelberg_Mixings","282182328_Sharpening_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture_with_Dimensional_Reduction","280695699_On_Natural_Inflation_and_Moduli_Stabilisation_in_String_Theory","278048295_Weak_Gravity_Strongly_Constrains_Large-Field_Axion_Inflation","275055108_Large-Field_Inflation_with_Multiple_Axions_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","274094058_Planckian_Axions_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","273640369_Transplanckian_axions","273158461_Constraints_on_Axion_Inflation_from_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture","265967317_On_the_Possibility_of_Large_Axion_Moduli_Spaces","263974707_THE_LOW_ENERGY_EFFECTIVE_LAGRANGIAN_FOR_PHOTON_INTERACTIONS_IN_ANY_DIMENSION","269417054_Natural_Inflation_and_Quantum_Gravity","264385385_Infrared_Consistency_and_the_Weak_Gravity_Conjecture"]}
