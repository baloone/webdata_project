{"id":"265200097_Recent_Results_on_Balanced_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","abstract":"In this paper we prove all balanced symmetric Boolean functions of fixed algebraic degree are trivial when the number of variables grows large enough. We also present the nonexistence of trivial balanced elementary symmetric Boolean function except for n = 2 t+1 l âˆ’ 1 and d = 2 t , where t and l are any nonnegative integers, which shows Cusick's conjecture for balanced elementary symmetric Boolean function is exactly the conjecture that all balanced elementary symmetric Boolean functions are trivial. In additional, we obtain a bound n0, which depends only on the algebraic degree, such that Cusick's conjecture holds for any n > n0.","authors":["Yingming Guo","Guangpu Gao","Yaqun Zhao"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62(9)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2015.2455052"],"references":["239921608_On_a_conjecture_for_balanced_symmetric_Boolean_functions","226218829_On_the_Correlation_of_Symmetric_Functions","224242544_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","3086750_Balanced_Symmetric_Functions_Over_hboxGFp","3085505_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","275603035_On_the_Balanced_Elementary_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","221540831_On_the_Algebraic_Immunity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220680333_The_Degree_of_Balanced_Elementary_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_of_bf_4kbf_3_Variables","220442010_Polynomials_with_two_Values","48194964_Linear_Recurrences_and_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Exponential_Sums_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","36960835_Advanced_Combinatorics","3080777_Maximum_nonlinearity_of_symmetric_Boolean_functions_on_odd_number_of_variables"]}
