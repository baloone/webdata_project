{"id":"282536000_Assessment_of_Higher_Education_Quality_by_Using_Cohort_of_First-year_in_University","abstract":"The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has issued a number of general guidelines for assessing continuous improvement (Criterion 4) but does not endorse any particular method or process for doing so. As a result, many universities seeking accreditation from the organization have developed their own methods to fulfill that particular criterion. The objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to present and review critically a number of methods used by ABET-accredited engineering programs for assessing continuous quality improvement, and 2) to present and argue in favor of a new and more efficient method based on cohort analysis.","authors":["Mouloud Aoudia","Khalil Marji","Deya Al-Deen AlQahsi"],"meta":["June 2015Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 191:330-335","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.310"],"references":["258389443_Specialization-Specific_Course_Assessments_Integrated_for_Program_Assessment","228816680_OUTCOMES_ASSESSMENT_IN_CHEMICAL_AND_PETROLEUM_ENGINEERING_PROGRAMS","345929298_Development_Of_Course_Assessment_Metrics_To_Measure_Program_Outcomes_Against_Abet_Criteria_In_A_Digital_Circuits_Class","293096210_Collecting_programmatic_assessment_data_with_no_extra_effort_Consolidated_evaluation_rubrics_for_chemical_plant_design","224207118_Direct_assessment_of_engineering_programs_at_the_City_College_of_New_York"]}
