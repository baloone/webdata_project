{"id":"328503939_The_ab_-Zagreb_index_of_some_derived_networks","abstract":"There is a very wide application of mathematics in communication theory, signal processing and networking. A network is formed by nodes communicating with each other. Graph theory plays a vital role in the area of networking research. A topological index is a numeric quantity obtained from a graph structure which is invariant under graph isomorphism. In this study, we obtained a generalized degree-based topological index, called -Zagreb index of some derived networks such as Sierpinski network, butterfly network, Benes network and mesh-derived network and hence consider some particular cases.","authors":["Prosanta Sarkar","Nilanjan De","Ismail naci Cangul","Anita Pal"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Taibah University for Science 13(1):1-8","DOI:10.1080/16583655.2018.1535881"],"references":["319902926_The_Zagreb_Indices_of_Graphs_Based_on_New_Operations_Related_to_the_Join_of_Graphs","315642509_On_topological_properties_of_sierpinski_networks_250","311989988_The_vertex_Zagreb_indices_of_some_graph_operations","308964862_F-index_and_coindex_of_some_derived_graphs","305075800_Computing_the_F-index_of_nanostar_dendrimers","285576535_Generalized_Zagreb_Index_of_V-Phenylenic_Nanotubes_and_Nanotorus_141","305516499_On_topological_properties_of_hierarchical_interconnection_networks","295547634_F-Index_of_some_graph_operations","289149917_Generalized_Zagreb_index_of_graphs","284476085_F-Index_of_Some_Graph_Operations"]}
