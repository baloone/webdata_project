{"id":"263619867_Fault-Tolerant_Approximate_Shortest-Path_Trees","abstract":"The resiliency of a network is its ability to remain \\emph{effectively}\nfunctioning also when any of its nodes or links fails. However, to reduce\noperational and set-up costs, a network should be small in size, and this\nconflicts with the requirement of being resilient. In this paper we address\nthis trade-off for the prominent case of the {\\em broadcasting} routing scheme,\nand we build efficient (i.e., sparse and fast) \\emph{fault-tolerant approximate\nshortest-path trees}, for both the edge and vertex \\emph{single-failure} case.\nIn particular, for an $n$-vertex non-negatively weighted graph, and for any\nconstant $\\varepsilon >0$, we design two structures of size $O(\\frac{n \\log\nn}{\\varepsilon^2})$ which guarantee $(1+\\varepsilon)$-stretched paths from the\nselected source also in the presence of an edge/vertex failure. This favorably\ncompares with the currently best known solutions, which are for the\nedge-failure case of size $O(n)$ and stretch factor 3, and for the\nvertex-failure case of size $O(n \\log n)$ and stretch factor 3. Moreover, we\nalso focus on the unweighted case, and we prove that an ordinary\n$(\\alpha,\\beta)$-spanner can be slightly augmented in order to build efficient\nfault-tolerant approximate \\emph{breadth-first-search trees}.","authors":["Davide Bilò","Luciano Gualà","Stefano Leucci","Guido Proietti"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44777-2_12","SourcearXiv","Conference: European Symposium on Algorithms"],"references":["263390493_Fault_Tolerant_Approximate_BFS_Structures","235794655_On_Resilient_Graph_Spanners","235666546_Sparse_Fault-Tolerant_BFS_Trees","234810199_Additive_spanners_and_a_b-spanners","226792540_f-Sensitivity_Distance_Oracles_and_Routing_Schemes","225814666_Swapping_a_Failing_Edge_of_a_Single_Source_Shortest_Paths_Tree_Is_Good_and_Fast","291466096_Fault_tolerant_additive_and_mu_alpha-spanners","286169692_New_Additive_Spanners","266961815_Fault_Tolerant_Additive_Spanners","261211957_Improved_Distance_Sensitivity_Oracles_via_Fast_Single-Source_Replacement_Paths","220994413_Approximate_Shortest_Paths_Avoiding_a_Failed_Vertex_Optimal_Size_Data_Structures_for_Unweighted_Graph","220616857_Fault_Tolerant_Spanners_for_General_Graphs","41547048_A_Nearly_Optimal_Oracle_for_Avoiding_Failed_Vertices_and_Edges","220223999_Polynomial_Time_Algorithms_for_2-Edge-Connectivity_Augmentation_Problems","48198667_Fault-Tolerant_Spanners_Better_and_Simpler"]}
