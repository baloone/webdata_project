{"id":"349294105_Physical_and_technical_aspects_of_human_magnetic_resonance_imaging_present_status_and_50_years_historical_review","abstract":"Since the proposal of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 1973, many researchers have been working on the development of clinical MRI systems. Currently, MRI is a primary method of medical imaging and an essential tool in brain science. Researchers from various scientific disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, information science, and electronics, participated in the development of MRI, which has become one of the major achievements in modern science and technology. MRI is expected to make further progress in the future mainly by utilizing the achievements of mathematical science and computer science. This paper reviews the historical developments, current status, and future prospect of the physical and engineering aspects of MRI.","authors":["Katsumi Kose"],"meta":["January 2021Advances in Physics: X 6(1):1885310","DOI:10.1080/23746149.2021.1885310"],"references":["337430222_In_vivo_human_head_MRI_at_105T_A_radiofrequency_safety_study_and_preliminary_imaging_results","328815392_A_Fast_GPU-optimized_3D_MRI_Simulator_for_Arbitrary_k-space_Sampling","322834716_The_growth_and_evolution_of_cardiovascular_magnetic_resonance_A_20-year_history_of_the_Society_for_Cardiovascular_Magnetic_Resonance_SCMR_annual_scientific_sessions","319154422_Ultra-High_Field_NMR_and_MRI-The_Role_of_Magnet_Technology_to_Increase_Sensitivity_and_Specificity","310387497_IseultINUMAC_Whole_Body_117_T_MRI_Magnet","309455513_Fast_Realistic_MRI_Simulations_Based_on_Generalized_Multi-Pool_Exchange_Tissue_Model","322953980_Flow_MRI_simulation_in_complex_3D_geometries_Application_to_the_cerebral_venous_network","318301443_Imaging_at_ultrahigh_magnetic_fields_History_challenges_and_solutions","317131512_BlochSolver_A_GPU-optimized_fast_3D_MRI_simulator_for_experimentally_compatible_pulse_sequences","311242042_Gradient_and_Shim_Technologies_for_Ultra_High_Field_MRI"]}
