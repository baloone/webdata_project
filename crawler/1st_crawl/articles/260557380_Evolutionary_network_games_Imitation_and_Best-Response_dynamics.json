{"id":"260557380_Evolutionary_network_games_Imitation_and_Best-Response_dynamics","abstract":"We consider games of strategic substitutes and strategic complements on\nnetworks. We introduce two different evolutionary dynamics in order to refine\ntheir multiplicity of equilibria, that can be related to alternative\ninformational contexts. We find that for the best-shot game, taken as a model\nfor substitutes, a replicator-like dynamics does not lead to Nash equilibria,\nwhereas it leads to unique equilibria (full cooperation or full defection,\ndepending on the initial condition and the game parameter) for complements,\nrepresented by a coordination game. On the other hand, when the dynamics\nbecomes more cognitively demanding in the form of a best response evolution,\npredictions are always Nash equilibria (at least when individuals are fully\nrational): For the best-shot game we find equilibria with a definite value of\nthe fraction of contributors, whereas for the coordination game symmetric\nequilibria arise only for low or high initial fractions of cooperators. We also\nconsider extensions of the natural incomplete information context and show that\nthe nature of the selected equilibria does not change for the best-shot game.\nHowever for coordination games we reveal an important difference, namely that\non infinitely large scale-free networks cooperation arises for any value of the\nincentive to cooperate.","authors":["Giulio Cimini","Claudio Castellano","Angel SÃ¡nchez"],"meta":["August 2017Complexity 2017","DOI:10.1155/2017/7259032","SourcearXiv"],"references":["322684103_Efficient_Use_of_Information_and_Social_Value_of_Information","309566124_Supplement_for_Efficient_Use_of_Information_and_Social_Value_of_Information","261799454_Dynamics_to_Equilibrium_in_Network_Games_Individual_Behavior_and_Global_Response","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","269019702_Bargaining_Games","268998071_Public_goods_in_directed_networks","263246525_Strategic_Interaction_and_Networks","258807943_RD_networks","257314960_Stochastic_stability_in_best_shot_network_games","256700980_Learning_in_Games"]}
