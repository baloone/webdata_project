{"id":"314306341_Motor-Skill_Learning_in_an_Insect_Inspired_Neuro-Computational_Control_System","abstract":"In nature, insects show impressive adaptation and learning capabilities. The proposed computational model takes inspiration from specific structures of the insect brain: after proposing key hypotheses on the direct involvement of the mushroom bodies (MBs) and on their neural organization, we developed a new architecture for motor learning to be applied in insect-like walking robots. The proposed model is a nonlinear control system based on spiking neurons. MBs are modeled as a nonlinear recurrent spiking neural network (SNN) with novel characteristics, able to memorize time evolutions of key parameters of the neural motor controller, so that existing motor primitives can be improved. The adopted control scheme enables the structure to efficiently cope with goal-oriented behavioral motor tasks. Here, a six-legged structure, showing a steady-state exponentially stable locomotion pattern, is exposed to the need of learning new motor skills: moving through the environment, the structure is able to modulate motor commands and implements an obstacle climbing procedure. Experimental results on a simulated hexapod robot are reported; they are obtained in a dynamic simulation environment and the robot mimicks the structures of Drosophila melanogaster.","authors":["Eleonora Arena","Paolo Arena","Roland Strauss","Luca Patan√©"],"meta":["March 2017Frontiers in Neurorobotics 11","DOI:10.3389/fnbot.2017.00012"],"references":["282149563_Distributed_Recurrent_Neural_Forward_Models_with_Synaptic_Adaptation_and_CPG-based_control_for_Complex_Behaviors_of_Walking_Robots","279551035_Sensorimotor_learning_in_bumblebees_Long-term_retention_and_reversal_training","321615839_Spatial_Temporal_Patterns_for_Action-Oriented_Perception_in_Roving_Robots_II_An_Insect_Brain_Computational_Model","314042603_Cellular_Neural_Networks","285687015_Learning_and_Memory","280895796_Neural_excitability_spiking_and_bursting","269075079_Efficient_Hexapodal_Locomotion_Control_Based_on_Flow-Invariant_Subspaces","268462041_The_Insect_Mushroom_Bodies_a_Paradigm_of_Neural_Reuse","267965040_Spatial_Temporal_Patterns_for_Action-Oriented_Perception_in_Roving_Robots","263904745_Neural_excitability_spiking_and_busting","263772703_Cellular_Neural_Networks_Chaos_Complexity_and_VLSI_Processing","261480196_CPG-based_locomotion_generation_in_a_Drosophila_inspired_legged_robot","261162983_A_computational_model_for_motor_learning_in_insects","261144617_Can_a_Fly_Ride_a_Bicycle_and_Discussion","261087135_Modeling_attentional_loop_in_the_insect_Mushroom_Bodies"]}
