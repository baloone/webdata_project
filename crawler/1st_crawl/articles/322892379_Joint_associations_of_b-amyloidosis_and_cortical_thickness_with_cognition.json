{"id":"322892379_Joint_associations_of_b-amyloidosis_and_cortical_thickness_with_cognition","abstract":"In 1164 cognitively unimpaired persons, aged 50-95 years, from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we examined the relationships of baseline cognition and cognitive changes across the full range of cortical thickness of an Alzheimer signature region of interest and global β-amyloid levels measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). In machine-learning models accounting for both biomarkers simultaneously, worsening biomarker values were additive and associated with lower baseline global cognition and greater subsequent decline in global cognition. Associations between Alzheimer's disease signature cortical thickness or PIB PET β-amyloid SUVR and baseline cognition were mainly linear. Lower Alzheimer's disease signature cortical thickness values across the entire range of thickness predicted future decline in global cognitive scores, demonstrating its close relationship to cognitive functioning. PIB PET β-amyloid SUVR also predicted cognitive decline across its full range, even when cortical thickness was accounted for. PIB PET β-amyloid's relationship to cognitive decline was nonlinear, more prominent at lower β-amyloid levels and less prominent at higher β-amyloid levels.","authors":["David S.
