{"id":"324139566_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_creativity_in_the_field_of_business_economics","abstract":"Creativity and its study in not a new topic. However, this concept has recently begun to be incorporated in business economic studies. The objective of the current study is to establish the results of creativity research in the scope of business economics. Using VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) and SciMAT (University of Granada, Spain) for the construction of scientific maps, the analysis of the most relevant studies in this field was conducted to establish how research has evolved in this area. The results show that initially, creativity was seen as an important skill of an individual and has gradually come to be recognized as a performance drive within organizations to serve as a basis for the development of various study models. The results presented in this study will enable future authors studying creativity to focus their studies more effectively.","authors":["Mauricio Castillo-Vergara","Alejandro Alvarez-Marin","Dario
