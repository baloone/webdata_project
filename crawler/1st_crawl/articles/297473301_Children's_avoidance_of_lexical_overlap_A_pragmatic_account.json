{"id":"297473301_Children's_avoidance_of_lexical_overlap_A_pragmatic_account","abstract":"Children tend to choose an unfamiliar object rather than a familiar one when asked to find the referent of a novel name. This response has been taken as evidence for the operation of certain lexical constraints in children's inferences of word meanings. The present studies test an alternative-pragmatic-explanation of this phenomenon among 3-year-olds. In Study 1 children responded to a request for the referent of a novel label in the same way that they responded to a request for the referent of a novel fact. Study 2 intimated that children assume that labels are common knowledge among members of the same language community. Study 3 demonstrated that shared knowledge between a speaker and listener plays a decisive role in how children interpret a speaker's request. The findings suggest that 3-year-olds' avoidance of lexical overlap is not unique to naming and may derive from children's sensitivity to speakers' communicative intentions.","authors":["Gil Diesendruck","Lori Markson"],"meta":["September 2001Developmental Psychology 37(5):630-641","DOI:10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.630","Conference: Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Research-in-Child-DevelopmentVolume: 37"],"references":["232426137_Young_Children_and_Adults_Use_Lexical_Principles_to_Learn_New_Nouns","20346826_Contrast_a_semantic_constraint","14170834_Markson_L_Bloom_P_Evidence_against_a_dedicated_system_for_word_learning_in_children_Nature_27_813-815","254751526_Definite_Reference_and_Mutual_Knowledge_Process_Models_of_Common_Ground_in_Comprehension","232470673_Sixteen_and_24-month-olds'_use_of_mutual_exclusivity_as_a_default_assumption_in_second-label_learning","227638513_Memory_and_Attention_Make_Smart_Word_Learning_An_Alternative_Account_of_Akhtar_Carpenter_and_Tomasello","227611944_Two-Year-Old_Children's_Sensitivity_to_a_Parent's_Knowledge_State_When_Making_Requests","222466647_Linguistic_biases_and_the_establishment_of_conceptual_hierarchies_Evidence_from_preschool_children","20909811_The_Principle_of_Mutual_Exclusivity_in_Word_Learning_To_Honor_or_Not_to_Honor","19790255_Children's_Use_of_Mutual_Exclusivity_to_Constrain_the_Meanings_of_Words","15338775_Acquisition_of_the_Novel_Name-Nameless_Category_N3C_Principle","14898545_Four-Year-Olds'_Disambiguation_of_Action_and_Object_Word_Reference","14821783_Infants'_ability_to_consult_the_speaker_for_clues_to_word_reference","14468079_Eighteen-month-olds_learn_words_in_non-ostensive_contexts","14064568_Monolingual_and_bilingual_children's_use_of_the_mutual_exclusivity_constraint","13678791_The_prevalence_and_the_weakness_of_an_early_name_mapping_preference","13105686_Lexical_Form_Class_Information_Guides_Word-to-Object_Mapping_in_Preschoolers"]}
