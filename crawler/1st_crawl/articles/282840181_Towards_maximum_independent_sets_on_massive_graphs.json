{"id":"282840181_Towards_maximum_independent_sets_on_massive_graphs","abstract":"Maximum independent set (MIS) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and it has important applications in many areas such as social network analysis, graphical information systems and coding theory. The problem is NP-hard, and there has been numerous studies on its approximate solutions. While successful to a certain degree, the existing methods require memory space at least linear in the size of the input graph. This has become a serious concern in view of the massive volume of today's fast-growing graphs.\nIn this paper, we study the MIS problem under the semi-external setting, which assumes that the main memory can accommodate all vertices of the graph but not all edges. We present a greedy algorithm and a general vertex-swap framework, which swaps vertices to incrementally increase the size of independent sets. Our solutions require only few sequential scans of graphs on the disk file, thus enabling in-memory computation without costly random disk accesses. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our solutions are able to compute a large independent set for a massive graph with 59 million vertices and 151 million edges using a commodity machine, with a memory cost of 469MB and a time cost of three minutes, while yielding an approximation ratio that is around 99% of the theoretical optimum.","authors":["Yu Liu","Jiaheng Lu","Hua Yang","Xiaokui Xiao"],"meta":["September 2015Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 8(13):2122-2133","DOI:10.14778/2831360.2831366"],"references":["260520621_Hop_Doubling_Label_Indexing_for_Point-to-Point_Distance_Querying_on_Scale-Free_Networks","259440783_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","236985430_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures_for_External_Memory","233390875_IS-LABEL_an_Independent-Set_based_Labeling_Scheme_for_Point-to-PointDistance_Querying_on_Large_Graphs","224258899_R-EVO_A_Reactive_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","221591870_Greed_is_Good_Approximating_Independent_Sets_in_Sparse_and_Bounded-Degree_Graphs","221131653_Fast_Local_Search_for_the_Maximum_Independent_Set_Problem","220312579_A_simple_simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","2434549_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_Applied_to_Map_Labelling","269298292_Fast_and_simple_approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_weighted_independent_set_of_links","243786338_A_Lower_Bound_on_the_Stability_Number_of_a_Simple_Graph","243772752_A_Functional_Approach_to_External_Graph_Algorithms","242422660_Vertex_packing_structural_properties_and_algorithms","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","226451846_Experimental_Evaluation_of_the_Greedy_and_Random_Algorithms_for_Finding_Independent_Sets_in_Random_Graphs","222614617_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Sets","221591083_On_the_limits_of_cache-obliviousness","221002274_Finding_maximum_independent_sets_in_graphs_arising_from_coding_theory","220779414_Approximating_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","220616667_On_Syntactic_versus_Computational_Views_of_Approximability","220568215_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_the_maximum_clique","220533300_Approximating_Maximum_Clique_by_Removing_Subgraphs","2948228_The_WebGraph_Framework_I_Compression_Techniques","2242751_A_Random_Graph_Model_for_Massive_Graphs"]}
