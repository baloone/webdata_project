{"id":"328127883_Optimal_sequence_planning_for_multi-model_reconfigurable_assembly_systems","abstract":"In this paper, a tri-objective optimization problem related to sequencing in multi-model reconfigurable assembly systems (RAS) is addressed. RASs are also designed around product families similar to the more generic reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs). A multi-model assembly line needs reconfiguration after assembling each batch of the products from the family. Further, the changeover of assembly line from one product type to another is also of varying degree of complexity and reconfiguration cost. Two novel indices for commonality and reconfiguration complexity are proposed here to incorporate this feature of RAS. Optimizing the reconfiguration time/cost is taken as the first objective while fulfilling the product due dates and the work load balance among the assembly stations as the second and third objective functions, respectively. This optimization problem is solved using a Multi-objective Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm (MOSOMA) metaheuristic to find the non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions representing optimum sequencing of products in the family. An approach for identifying the best solution from the multiple Pareto optimal solutions using aggregate fitness is also proposed. A numerical illustration along with computational procedure is presented on a hypothetical RAS model.","authors":["Avinash Kumar","L N Pattanaik","Rajeev Agrawal"],"meta":["February 2019The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 100(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00170-018-2826-8","Project: Modeling and optimization of reconfigurable assembly line"],"references":["318355489_Scheduling_and_Operator_Control_in_Reconfigurable_Assembly_Systems","314715883_Capacity_management_of_modular_assembly_systems","290381272_Bi-objective_optimization_of_integrating_configuration_generation_and_scheduling_for_reconfigurable_flow_lines_using_NSGA-II","283203454_Design_of_reconfigurable_flow_lines_using_MOPSO_and_maximum_deviation_theory","309230335_A_multi-agent_framework_for_capability-based_reconfiguration_of_industrial_assembly_systems","308709859_Multi-objective_optimal_scheduling_of_reconfigurable_assembly_line_for_cloud_manufacturing","304103905_Design_and_management_of_reconfigurable_assembly_lines_in_the_automotive_industry","302368850_Study_on_the_Architecture_of_Reconfigurable_Assembly_System","280802010_The_new_assembly_system_paradigm","275773369_Decision_making_logic_for_flexible_assembly_lines_reconfiguration","271335749_Multi_criteria_assembly_line_design_and_configuration_-_An_automotive_case_study","264043500_An_exact_optimization_approach_for_a_Transfer_Line_Reconfiguration_Problem","267810996_Multi-objective_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_simultaneous_sequencing_and_balancing_of_mixed_model_assembly_line","266715684_SOMA_-_self-organizing_migrating_algorithm","261667139_Design_for_agile_assembly_An_operational_perspective"]}
