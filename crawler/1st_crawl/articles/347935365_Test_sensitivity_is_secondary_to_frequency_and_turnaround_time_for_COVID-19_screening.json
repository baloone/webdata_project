{"id":"347935365_Test_sensitivity_is_secondary_to_frequency_and_turnaround_time_for_COVID-19_screening","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","authors":["Daniel B Larremore","Bryan Wilder","Evan Lester","Soraya Shehata"],"meta":["November 2020Science Advances 7(1)","DOI:10.1126/sciadv.abd5393"],"references":["350064490_Early_Viral_Clearance_and_Antibody_Kinetics_of_COVID-19_Among_Asymptomatic_Carriers","346474014_SARS-CoV-2_genomic_and_subgenomic_RNAs_in_diagnostic_samples_are_not_an_indicator_of_active_replication","344393946_Modeling_between-population_variation_in_COVID-19_dynamics_in_Hubei_Lombardy_and_New_York_City","344301781_Reductions_in_commuting_mobility_correlate_with_geographic_differences_in_SARS-CoV-2_prevalence_in_New_York_City","344157835_Quantifying_antibody_kinetics_and_RNA_detection_during_early-phase_SARS-CoV-2_infection_by_time_since_symptom_onset","343726978_Comparison_of_molecular_testing_strategies_for_COVID-19_control_a_mathematical_modelling_study","343354615_Assessment_of_SARS-CoV-2_Screening_Strategies_to_Permit_the_Safe_Reopening_of_College_Campuses_in_the_United_States","347165725_Longitudinal_Surveillance_for_SARS-CoV-2_Among_Staff_in_Six_Colorado_Long_Term_Care_Facilities_Epidemiologic_Virologic_and_Sequence_Analysis","346214102_SARS-CoV-2_SARS-CoV-1_and_MERS-CoV_Viral_Load_Dynamics_Duration_of_Viral_Shedding_and_Infectiousness_A_Living_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","346116104_Frequency_of_Routine_Testing_for_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_in_High-risk_Healthcare_Environments_to_Reduce_Outbreaks"]}
