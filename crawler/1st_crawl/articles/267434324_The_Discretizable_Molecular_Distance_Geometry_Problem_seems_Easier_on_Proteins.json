{"id":"267434324_The_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_seems_Easier_on_Proteins","abstract":"Distance geometry methods are used to turn a set of interatomic distances given by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments into a consistent molecular conformation. In a set of papers (see the survey [8]) we proposed a Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm for computing the set X of all incongruent embeddings of a given protein backbone. Although BP has a worst-case exponential running time in general, we always noticed a linear-like behaviour in computational experiments. In this chapter we provide a theoretical explanation to our observations. We show that the BP is fixed-parameter tractable on protein-like graphs and empirically show that the parameter is constant on a set of proteins from the Protein Data Bank.","authors":["Leo Liberti","Carlile Lavor","Antonio Mucherino"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-5128-0_3"],"references":["268018683_Distance_Geometry_and_Molecular_Conformation","239667563_Molecular_Modeling_and_Simulation_An_Interdisciplinary_Guide","228934418_On_a_Relationship_Between_Graph_Realizability_and_Distance_Matrix_Completion","228665757_On_the_solution_of_molecular_distance_geometry_problems_with_interval_data","225562672_On_the_Computation_of_Protein_Backbones_by_using_Artificial_Backbones_of_Hydrogens","225202160_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_Problems","225162852_The_Discretizable_Distance_Geometry_Problem","221333775_MD-jeep_An_Implementation_of_a_Branch_and_Prune_Algorithm_for_Distance_Geometry_Problems","221245986_Rigidity_Computation_and_Randomization_in_Network_Localization","220453469_Generic_Global_Rigidity","47374504_On_the_Number_of_Solutions_of_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","12709584_The_Protein_Data_Bank","285981037_Global_continuation_for_distance_geometry_problems","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","264465058_A_Branch-and-Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","239597445_Embeddability_of_weighted_graphs_in_k-space_is_strongly_NP-hard","233420476_The_Protein_Data_Bank","228568491_1_The_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","228340096_Molecular_distance_geometry_methods_From_continuous_to_discrete","227658216_A_Branch-and-Prune_algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","225857936_A_Geometric_Build-Up_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_with_Sparse_Distance_Data","224908791_Molecular_Modeling_and_Simulation","210231991_Combinatorial_Rigidity","2711358_Global_Continuation_For_Distance_Geometry_Problems"]}
