{"id":"327512944_Optimal_design_and_evaluation_of_a_dexterous_4_DoFs_haptic_device_based_on_delta_architecture","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel kinematic of a four degrees of freedom (DoFs) device based on Delta architecture. This new device is expected to be used as a haptic device for tele-operation applications. The challenging task was to obtain orientation DoFs from the Delta structure. A fourth leg is added to the Delta structure to convert translations into rotations and to provide translation of the handle. The fourth leg is linked to the base and to the moving platform by two universal joints. The architecture as well as the kinematic model of the new structure, called 4haptic, are presented. Comparisons in terms of kinematic behavior between the 4haptic device and the existing device developed based on spherical parallel manipulator architecture are presented. The results prove the improved behavior of the 4haptic device offering a singularity-free useful workspace, which makes it a suitable candidate to tele-operated system for Minimally Invasive Surgery. The dimensions of the 4haptic device, having the smallest workspace containing a prespecified region in space, are identified based on an optimal dimensional synthesis method.","authors":["CÃ©lestin Preault","Houssem Saafi","med amine Laribi","Said Zeghloul"],"meta":["September 2018Robotica 37(7):1-22","DOI:10.1017/S0263574718000929"],"references":["306087384_Medical_telerobotic_systems_Current_status_and_future_trends","271746059_Redundantly_actuated_3-RRR_spherical_parallel_manipulator_usedas_a_haptic_device_Improving_dexterity_and_eliminating_singularity","257691028_Synthesis_of_spherical_parallel_manipulator_for_dexterous_medical_task","224591619_Design_of_a_Minimally_Invasive_Surgical_Teleoperated_Master-Slave_System_with_Haptic_Feedback","222220390_Analysis_and_dimensional_synthesis_of_the_DELTA_robot_for_a_prescribed_workspace","220042576_The_sigma7_haptic_interface_for_MiroSurge_A_new_bi-manual_surgical_console","23715603_The_value_of_haptic_feedback_in_conventional_and_robot-assisted_minimal_invasive_surgery_and_virtual_reality_training_A_current_review","5581008_Haptics_in_minimally_invasive_surgery_-_A_review","311776806_Optimal_torque_distribution_for_a_redundant_3-RRR_spherical_parallel_manipulator_used_as_a_haptic_medical_device","279221573_Design_process_for_robotic_medical_tool_guidance_manipulators","277817964_Forward_kinematic_model_improvement_of_a_spherical_parallel_manipulator_using_an_extra_sensor","261735328_Towards_open-source_low-cost_haptics_for_surgery_simulation","231966822_DELTA_A_simple_and_efficient_parallel_robot","230826045_Human-Centered_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Haptic_Cueing_for_Teleoperation_of_Multiple_Mobile_Robots","224091770_Design_of_Haptic_Interface_for_Brickout_Game","222714738_Virtual_reality_and_haptics_as_a_training_device_for_movement_rehabilitation_after_stroke_A_single-case_study","221012225_The_Role_of_Force_Feedback_in_Surgery_Analysis_of_Blunt_Dissection","7239174_Equipment_and_technology_in_surgical_robotics","5670307_Effects_of_Visual_Force_Feedback_on_Robot-Assisted_Surgical_Task_Performance","4131397_Design_of_a_Wearable_Haptic_Interface_for_Precise_Finger_Interactions_in_Large_Virtual_Environments"]}
