{"id":"351745973_Improved_protein_structure_prediction_by_deep_learning_irrespective_of_co-evolution_information","abstract":"Predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its primary sequence has been greatly improved by integrating deep learning and co-evolutionary analysis, as shown in CASP13 and CASP14. We describe our latest study of this idea, analysing the efficacy of network size and co-evolution data and its performance on both natural and designed proteins. We show that a large ResNet (convolutional residual neural networks) can predict structures of correct folds for 26 out of 32 CASP13 free-modelling targets and L/5 long-range contacts with precision over 80%. When co-evolution is not used, ResNet can still predict structures of correct folds for 18 CASP13 free-modelling targets, greatly exceeding previous methods that do not use co-evolution either. Even with only the primary sequence, ResNet can predict the structures of correct folds for all tested human-designed proteins. In addition, ResNet may fare better for the designed proteins when trained without co-evolution than with co-evolution. These results suggest that ResNet does not simply de-noise co-evolution signals, but instead may learn important protein sequenceâ€“structure relationships. This has important implications for protein design and engineering, especially when co-evolutionary data are unavailable.","authors":["Jinbo Xu","Matthew Mcpartlon","Jin Li"],"meta":["July 2021Nature Machine Intelligence 3(7):1-9","DOI:10.1038/s42256-021-00348-5"],"references":["350665317_Biological_structure_and_function_emerge_from_scaling_unsupervised_learning_to_250_million_protein_sequences","343897761_Computational_design_of_transmembrane_pores","343578470_Predicting_the_Real-Valued_Inter-Residue_Distances_for_Proteins","337101498_MGnify_The_microbiome_analysis_resource_in_2020","336414616_Protein_structure_prediction_using_multiple_deep_neural_networks_in_CASP13","335606159_Deep_learning_extends_de_novo_protein_modelling_coverage_of_genomes_using_iteratively_predicted_structural_constraints","346133736_The_IMGM_data_management_and_analysis_system_v60_New_tools_and_advanced_capabilities","344077793_Expanding_the_space_of_protein_geometries_by_computational_design_of_de_novo_fold_families","338362090_Improved_protein_structure_prediction_using_predicted_interresidue_orientations","336286132_Assessing_the_accuracy_of_contact_predictions_in_CASP13","334428525_Prediction_of_inter-residue_contacts_with_DeepMetaPSICOV_in_CASP13","335520302_Analysis_of_distance-based_protein_structure_prediction_by_deep_learning_in_CASP13","335146126_Ensembling_multiple_raw_coevolutionary_features_with_deep_residual_neural_networks_for_contact-map_prediction_in_CASP13","335094411_Distance-based_protein_folding_powered_by_deep_learning","334690023_A_further_leap_of_improvement_in_tertiary_structure_prediction_in_CASP13_prompts_new_routes_for_future_assessments"]}
