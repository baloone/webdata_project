{"id":"330841291_Analyzing_and_Implementing_an_Online_Metro_Reservation_System","abstract":"In most nations, the old transport system has been replaced with the evolutionary development of the new one to satisfy the socio economic necessity of the people. As Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh is witnessing rapidly shifting microcosm of global trends in transportation, making this city an exceptional case study. This study examines the need and the development of computerized system of passenger reservation for Riyadh metro, with the aim of designing and implementing an online Metro Reservation System called Riyadh Metro Reservation System (RMRS). RMRS enables and assists passengers in managing reservation and modifying cancellation/refunds while overcoming excessing human interference in ticket's issuance process and efficiently managing their ticketing transaction, without having to face delay by the usual procedure of manual ticket issuing or obstacles from metro counter staff. The proposed system was designed and implemented utilizing the Unified Modeling Language (UML), Microsoft Access 2010 and ASP.NET programming languages.","authors":["Nora Alsubaie","Nashwa Althaqafi","Eman Alradwan","Fatima Al-Hazza"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["325361012_Looking_Inside_and_Outside_the_System_Examining_the_Factors_Influencing_Distance_Learners_Satisfaction_in_Learning_Management_System","324174644_Real-Time_Elderly_Healthcare_Monitoring_Expert_System_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Network","323397735_Hybrid_Elitist-Ant_System_for_Nurse-Rostering_Problem","322990964_Content_based_image_retrieval_using_deep_learning_process","322955860_Healthcare_professionals'_acceptance_Electronic_Health_Records_system_Critical_literature_review_Jordan_case_study","319073707_Performance_Assessment_of_the_Linear_Nonlinear_and_Nonparametric_Data_Driven_Models_in_River_Flow_Forecasting","323380324_An_enhanced_artificial_bee_colony_optimizer_and_its_application_to_multi-level_threshold_image_segmentation","323373904_Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses_and_Treatable_Diseases_by_Image-Based_Deep_Learning","322319200_Methodologic_Guide_for_Evaluating_Clinical_Performance_and_Effect_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Technology_for_Medical_Diagnosis_and_Prediction","320837433_Information_Retrieves_from_Brain_MRI_Images_for_Tumor_Detection_Using_Hybrid_Technique_K-means_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_KMANN"]}
