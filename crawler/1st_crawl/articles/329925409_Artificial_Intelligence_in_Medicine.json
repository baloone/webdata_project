{"id":"329925409_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Medicine","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science of creating intelligent computer programs. The aim of AI is to help doctors in clinical diagnosis and treatment and to reduce the rate of medical error. The main AI methods used extensively are expert systems (ESs), fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). ESs make inferences with patient data in cause and effect rela-tionships and make recommendations to the doctor. Fuzzy systems aim to produce scientific ex-pressions and approximate results from uncertain data such as those in the field of medicine. ANNs contain neurons that mimic the biological nervous systems. A network is obtained by connecting these neurons in various ways. AI methods continue to evolve even if medical field use has been tested many times. In the present study, a brief evaluation has been made regarding the methods mentioned. \n\n(PDF) Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
