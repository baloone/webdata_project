{"id":"271614861_A_Review_on_Value_Chain_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Today, the universities as higher education instituts are faced with a changing environment. Increasing international competition besides changing management paradigms in higher education, make universities encounter with new challenges. So knowing factors which improve management methods and create competitive advantage is very important. We aim to reviewresearches on value chain in higher education and related fields. Some of these researches applied the basic Porters value chain model inexplaining part of the activities. But some of them believe that the Porters model is designed specifically for business enterprises not social services organizations, and higher education as a service sector needs a specific value chain model which can explain process and components of value adding in this sector.
