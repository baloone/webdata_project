{"id":"267041983_Modeling_Geodetic_Processes_with_Levy_alpha_a_-Stable_Distribution_and_FARIMA","abstract":"Over the last years the scientific community has been using the auto regressive\nmoving average (ARMA) model in the modeling of the noise in GPS time\nseries (daily solution). This work starts with the investigation of the limit of such\na model widely used in signal processing when the measure noise is considered as\nwhite. Since a typical GPS time series consists of geophysical signals (e.g. seasonal\nsignal) and stochastic processes (e.g coloured and white noise), the ARMA model\nmay be inappropriate. Therefore, we propose to use the fractional auto regressive\nintegrated moving average (FARIMA) model. The simulation results using simulated\ntime series as well as real GPS time series from a few selected stations around\nAustralia show that the FARIMA model fits the time series better than other models\nwhen the coloured noise is larger than the white noise. The second fold of this work\nfocuses on fitting the GPS time series with the family of Levy alpha-stable distributions.\nUsing this distribution, we develop a hypothesis test to eliminate effectively coarse\noutliers from GPS time series, achieving better performance than using the rule of\nthumb of n standard deviations (with n chosen manually).","authors":["Jean-Philippe Montillet","Kegen Yu"],"meta":["December 2014Mathematical Geosciences","DOI:10.1007/s11004-014-9574-6","Project: Geodetic Time Series Analysis"],"references":["258662063_On_seasonal_signals_in_geodetic_time_series","257527915_Extracting_Colored_Noise_Statistics_in_Time_Series_via_Negentropy","313772283_Effect_of_annual_signals_on_geodetic_velocity","313715558_Fractional_Brownian_motions_fractional_noises_and_applications","313502744_Long-term_storage_of_reservoirs_An_experimental_study","313399308_Econometric_analysis_of_cross_section_and_panel_data","280929481_New_Outlier_Separability_Test_and_Its_Application_in_GNSS_Positioning","261541081_Effect_of_annual_signals_on_geodetic_velocity_J_Geophys_Res_107B7_DOI_1010192001JB000570","258900906_Error_analysis_of_continuous_GPS_time_series","258794021_A_Bayesian_Monte_Carlo_Markov_Chain_Method_for_Parameter_Estimation_of_Fractional_Differenced_Gaussian_Processes","253135631_Noise_in_GPS_coordinate_time_series","257338688_Outlier_separability_analysis_with_a_multiple_alternative_hypotheses_test","256938790_The_ANU_GRACE_visualisation_web_portal","248803838_Troposphere_Mapping_Functions_for_GPS_and_Very_Long_Baseline_Interferometry_from_European_Centre_for_Medium-Range_Weather_Forecasts_Operational_Analysis_Data","248420538_Extracting_Colored_Noise_Statistics_in_Time_Series_via_Negentropy"]}
