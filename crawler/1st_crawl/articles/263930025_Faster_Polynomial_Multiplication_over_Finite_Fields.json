{"id":"263930025_Faster_Polynomial_Multiplication_over_Finite_Fields","abstract":"Polynomials over finite fields play a central role in algorithms for cryptography, error correcting codes, and computer algebra. The complexity of multiplying such polynomials is still a major open problem. Let p be a prime, and let Mp(n) denote the bit complexity of multiplying two polynomials in Fp[X] of degree less than n. For n large compared to p, we establish the bound Mp(n) = O(nlog n8log∗ n log p), where log∗ n = min{k ∈ ℕ: log κ×. log n ≥ 1} stands for the iterated logarithm. This improves on the previously best known bound Mp(n) = O(nlog nlog log nlog p), which essentially goes back to the 1970s.","authors":["David Harvey","Joris van der Hoeven","Grégoire Lecerf"],"meta":["July 2014Journal of the ACM 63(6)","DOI:10.1145/3005344","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263930024_Even_faster_integer_multiplication","243766641_Discrete_Weighted_Transforms_and_Large-Integer_Arithmetic","303491014_Searching_for_primitive_roots_in_finite_fields","288859582_Handbook_of_Elliptic_and_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptography","268829272_Divisors_of_Mersenne_Numbers","267004817_Computational_Complexity","265453193_On_Distinguishing_Prime_Numbers_from_Composite_Numbers","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","246355369_Handbook_of_Elliptic_and_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptography"]}
