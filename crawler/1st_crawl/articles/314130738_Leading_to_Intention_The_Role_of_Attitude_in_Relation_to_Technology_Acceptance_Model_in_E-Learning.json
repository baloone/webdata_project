However, the intensity of its usage is not very remarkable, there is a need to understand student's attitude on the use of the e-learning system from the perspectives of the Technology Acceptance Model. The objective of the study is to investigate the attitude of university students about the use of E-learning based on the Technology Acceptance Model. This research is to analyze the relationship of university students’ intention to use e-learning with three antecedents include attitude, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.
