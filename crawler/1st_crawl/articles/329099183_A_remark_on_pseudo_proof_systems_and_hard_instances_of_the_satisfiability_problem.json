{"id":"329099183_A_remark_on_pseudo_proof_systems_and_hard_instances_of_the_satisfiability_problem","abstract":"We link two concepts from the literature, namely hard sequences for the satisfiability problem sat and so‐called pseudo proof systems proposed for study by Krajíček. Pseudo proof systems are elements of a particular nonstandard model constructed by forcing with random variables. We show that the existence of mad pseudo proof systems is equivalent to the existence of a randomized polynomial time procedure with a highly restrictive use of randomness which produces satisfiable formulas whose satisfying assignments are probably hard to find.","authors":["Jan Maly","Moritz Müller"],"meta":["November 2018Mathematical logic quarterly MLQ 64(1)","DOI:10.1002/malq.201700009"],"references":["301537138_Construction_of_models_of_bounded_arithmetic_by_restricted_reduced_powers","271898085_On_optimal_inverters","325538879_Metamathematics_of_first-order_arithmetic","317164263_Introduction_to_Lattice_Theory_with_Computer_Science_Applications","316518716_Finding_hard_instances_of_the_satisfiability_problem_A_survey","312662323_Universal_sequential_search_problems","292562871_Proceedings_of_the_Annual_IEEE_Conference_on_Computational_Complexity_Preface","280546198_The_Circuit-Input_Game_Natural_Proofs_and_Testing_Circuits_With_Data","266512682_Logic_colloquium_'01_Proceedings_of_the_annual_European_summer_meeting_of_the_Association_for_Symbolic_Logic_ASL_Vienna_Austria_August_6-11_2001","266248528_Set_Theory_The_Third_Millennium_Edition_Revised_and_Expanded"]}
