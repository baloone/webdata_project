{"id":"229086194_The_Value_of_the_World's_Ecosystem_Services_and_Natural_Capital","abstract":"The services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocksthat produce them are critical to the functioning of the\nEarth’s life-support system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent\npart of the total economic value of the planet.We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services\nfor 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of\nwhich is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US$16–54 trillion (1012) per year, with an average of\nUS$33trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, thismust be considered a minimum estimate. Global\ngross national product total is around US$18 trillion per year.","authors":["Robert Costanza","Arge","Rudolf de Groot","Stephen Farberk"],"meta":["May 1997Nature 387(15):253-260","DOI:10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2","SourceRePEc"],"references":["285444691_Modeling_Complex_Ecological_Economic_Systems_Toward_an_Evolutionary_Dynamic_Understanding_of_People_and_Nature","317617653_Using_Surveys_to_Value_Public_Goods_The_Contingent_Valuation_Method","316359355_For_the_Common_Good_Redirecting_the_Economy_toward_Community_the_Environment_and_a_Sustainable_Future","300067486_Sustainable_economic_development_economic_and_ethical_principles","285723237_Correction_Primary_production_required_to_sustain_global_fisheries_Nature_1995_374_255-257","284091231_Valuing_ecosystem_services_philosophical_bases_and_empirical_methods_in_Nature_'_s_Services_-_Societal_Dependence_on_Natural_Ecosystems","279545779_Economics_and_wetland_management","274304537_Economic_Values_and_the_Natural_World","266373953_Functions_of_nature_Evaluation_of_nature_in_environmental_planning_management_and_decision-making","266373842_Valuing_Ecosystem_Services_with_Efficiency_Fairness_and_Sustainability_as_Goals"]}
