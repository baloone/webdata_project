{"id":"221343937_Randomized_Byzantine_Agreements","abstract":"Randomized algorithms for reaching Byzantine Agreement were recently proposed in [Rabi83]. With these algorithms, agreement is reached within an expected number of phases that is a small constant independent of the number of processes n and the number of faulty processes t. The algorithms in [Rabi83] tolerate up to [(n-1)/10] faulty processes in asynchronous systems, and up to [(n-1)/4] faulty processes in synchronous systems. In this paper, using the same computation model as in [Rabi83], we describe algorithms that overcome up to [(n-1)/3] faulty processes in asynchronous systems, and up to [(n-1)/2] faulty processes in synchronous systems. With both proposed algorithms, agreement is reached within an expected number of phases that is a small constant independent of n and t, but the communication complexity is higher than in [Rabi83]. It is also shown that no Byzantine Agreement algorithm can overcome more than [(n-1)/3] faulty processes in asynchronous authenticated systems, and hence the asynchronous algorithm proposed here is optimal in this respect.","authors":["Sam Toueg"],"meta":["January 1984","DOI:10.1145/800222.806744","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the third annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing"],"references":["220616485_Authenticated_Algorithms_for_Byzantine_Agreement","242379324_Byzantine_agreement_made_simple_simulating_authentication_without_signatares","242378269_An_authenticated_byzantine_generals_algorithm_with_early_stopping","222460125_The_Byzantine_General_Strike_Again","222441633_Extending_binary_Byzantine_agreement_to_multivalued_Byzantine_agreement","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret","4355220_Unanimity_in_an_unknown_and_unreliable_environment"]}
