{"id":"236218230_Link_failure_and_congestion-aware_reliable_data_delivery_mechanism_for_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","abstract":"Link failures and packet drops due to congestion are two frequently occurring problems in mobile ad hoc networks, degrading the network performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a link failure and congestion-aware reliable data delivery (LCRDD) mechanism that jointly exploits local packet buffering and multilevel congestion detection and control approaches for increasing the data delivery performance. On the detection of link failure or congestive state, an LCRDD intermediate node buffers the incoming data packets at the transport layer queue and resumes transmission when the route is repaired locally. In addition, LCRDD’s multilevel congestion detection helps it to take the most appropriate action proactively. Thus, it offers increased reliability and throughput and decreased end-to-end packet delivery delay and routing overhead compared to state-of-the-art protocols, as shown in results of performance evaluations carried out in network simulator v-2.34.","authors":["Manowarul Islam","Md.
