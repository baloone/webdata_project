{"id":"273340550_Local_projection_type_stabilization_applied_to_inf-sup_stable_discretizations_of_the_Oseen_problem","abstract":"The one- and two-level local projection methods are applied to inf–sup stable discretizations of the Oseen problem. Error\nbounds of order r are proved for known inf–sup stable pairs of finite element spaces which approximate velocity and pressure by elements of\norder r and r−1, respectively. New families of inf–sup stable finite element spaces are proposed which approximate velocity and pressure\nby different elements, being both of order r. In the small viscosity case, an improved error estimate of order r+1/2 is shown. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence results.","authors":["Gunar Matthies","Lutz Tobiska"],"meta":["January 2014IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis 35(1):239-269","DOI:10.1093/imanum/drt064"],"references":["242922207_Streamline_Diffusion_Methods_for_the_Incompressible_Euler_and_Navier-Stokes_Equations","240949470_A_unified_convergence_analysis_for_local_projection_stabilisationsapplied_to_the_Oseen_problem","237376792_Local_projection_stabilization_for_incompressible_flows_equal-order_vs_inf-sup_stable_interpolation","228868991_Some_Remarks_on_Residual-based_Stabilisation_of_Inf-Sup_Stable_Discretisations_of_the_Generalised_Oseen_Proble","227002178_A_finite_element_pressure_gradient_stabilization_for_the_Stokes_equations_based_on_local_projections","226478033_Applying_Local_Projection_Stabilization_to_inf-sup_Stable_Elements","226250113_A_modified_streamline_diffusion_method_for_solving_the_stationary_Navier-Stokes_equation","225695463_On_the_reference_mapping_for_quadrilateral_and_hexahedral_finite_elements_on_multilevel_adaptive_grids","225625854_A_stable_finite_element_for_the_Stokes_equations","222450404_Incompressible_flow_computations_with_stabilized_bilinear_and_linear_equal-order-interpolation_velocity-pressure_elements","220577438_Local_projection_stabilization_of_equal_order_interpolation_applied_to_the_Stokes_problem","220576623_A_new_family_of_stable_mixed_finite_elements_for_3D_Stokes_equations","37445484_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_the_Oseen_Problem_and_its_Interpretation_as_a_Variational_Multiscale_Method","2389184_Grad-Div_Stablilization_For_Stokes_Equations","2095712_Approximation_by_quadrilateral_finite_elements","318107835_Stabilized_finite_element_methods_for_the_generalized_Oseen_problem","266859317_On_the_parameter_choice_in_grad-div_stabilization_for_the_Stokes_equations","265682026_Norm_estimates_for_a_maximal_right_inverse_of_the_divergence_operator_in_spaces_of_piecewise_polynomials","265373941_Conforming_and_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_stationary_Stokes_equations_I","257634474_A_two-level_local_projection_stabilisation_on_uniformly_refined_triangular_meshes","256918445_On_a_reduced_sparsity_stabilization_of_grad-div_type_for_incompressible_flow_problems","253178890_Stability_of_Finite_Elements_under_Divergence_Constraints","250692481_A_velocity-pressure_streamline_diffusion_finite_element_method_for_the_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations","230649791_Estimation_of_Linear_Functionals_on_Sobolev_Spaces_with_Application_to_Fourier_Transforms_and_Spline_Interpolation","229271462_The_quadrilateral_'Mini'_finite_element_for_the_Stokes_problem","228621682_Mass_conservation_of_finite_element_methods_for_coupled_flow-transport_problems","227781562_Efficient_augmented_Lagrangian-type_preconditioning_for_the_Oseen_problem_using_Grad-Div_stabilization","226917610_On_the_Application_of_Local_Projection_Methods_to_Convection-Diffusion-Reaction_Problems","226811525_Mapped_Finite_Elements_on_Hexahedra_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Optimal_Interpolation_Errors","226724201_Bounds_for_the_Class_of_Linear_Functionals_with_Application_to_Hermite_Interpolation","226632353_Recent_Results_on_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_Convection-Diffusion_and_Flow_Problems","225779021_MooNMD_-_A_program_package_based_on_mapped_finite_element_methods","223804274_Stabilized_finite_element_schemes_for_incompressible_flow_using_Scott-Vogelius_elements","222694879_Grad-Div_stabilization_and_subgrid_pressure_models_for_the_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations","222554997_Stabilized_finite_element_schemes_with_LBB-stable_elements_for_incompressible_flows","222477805_Stabilized_finite_element_methods_II_The_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations","222349632_An_efficient_smoother_for_the_Stokes_problem","220179018_A_Generalization_of_the_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_Convection-Diffusion-Reaction_Equations","51992280_The_Inf-Sup_Condition_for_the_Mapped_Q_k-P_k-1textdisc_Element_in_Arbitrary_Space_Dimensions","51992147_A_new_finite_element_formulation_for_computational_fluid_dynamics_V_Circumventing_the_Babuka-Brezzi_condition_A_stable_Petrov-Galerkin_formulation_of_the_Stokes_problem_accommodating_equal-order_inter"]}
