{"id":"329384244_The_Complexity_of_Some_Classes_of_Pyramid_Graphs_Created_from_a_Gear_Graph","abstract":"The methods of measuring the complexity (spanning trees) in a finite graph, a problem related to various areas of mathematics and physics, have been inspected by many mathematicians and physicists. In this work, we defined some classes of pyramid graphs created by a gear graph then we developed the Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem method to produce explicit formulas for the complexity of these graphs, using linear algebra, matrix analysis techniques, and employing knowledge of Chebyshev polynomials. Finally, we gave some numerical results for the number of spanning trees of the studied graphs.","authors":["Jia-Bao Liu","S.N.
