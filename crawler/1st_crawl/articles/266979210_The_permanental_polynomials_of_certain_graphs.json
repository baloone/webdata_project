{"id":"266979210_The_permanental_polynomials_of_certain_graphs","abstract":"In this paper we consider the computation of permanental polynomials of some graphs. By orienting even cycles oddly, explicit expressions for the permanental polynomials of some basic graphs including a path and a cycle are obtained in terms of roots. For hexagonal systems, based on reduction procedures, the permanental polynomials of hexagonal chains and a type of pericondensed hexagonal system are deduced from product of matrices of order 5. Meanwhile, the permanental polynomial of a general polygonal chain is also derived.","authors":["Wei Li","Heping Zhang"],"meta":["January 2012MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 68(3)"],"references":["266608446_Computing_the_permanental_polynomial_of_a_multigraph","256584487_Computing_the_Permanental_Polynomial_of_a_Matrix_from_a_Combinatorial_Viewpoint","256091457_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Larger_Fullerenes","225606714_Computing_the_Characteristic_polynomial_of_a_graph","225206133_On_the_Permanental_Polynomials_of_Some_Graphs","285737362_Chemical_graph_theory_III_On_the_permanental_polynomial","268972983_On_spectrum_and_per-spectrum_of_graphs","268552948_Relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_fullerenes_and_benzenoid_hydrocarbons","267189752_Computing_the_permanental_polynomial_of_C_60_in_parallel","266012860_A_note_on_the_relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_coronoid_hydrocarbons","242308741_N-Sun_Decomposition_of_Complete_Complete_Bipartite_and_Some_Harary_Graphs","238850609_Characteristic_polynomial_of_catacondensed_systems","229312836_Combinatorial_approach_for_computing_the_characteristic_polynomial_of_a_matrix","226646531_Some_Topological_Properties_of_Benzenoid_Systems","222958722_Permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","222939742_Matchings_in_Graphs_on_Non-orientable_Surfaces","222574178_Dimer_problem_on_the_cylinder_and_torus","220257252_An_efficient_algorithm_for_computing_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","12278312_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Smaller_Fullerenes","12278311_The_Permanental_Polynomial","11083171_A_Differential-Operator_Approach_to_the_Permanental_Polynomial"]}
