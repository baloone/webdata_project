{"id":"318910892_A_characterization_of_mathbb_Z_2mathbb_Z_2u_Z_2_Z_2_u_-linear_codes","abstract":"We prove that the class of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_2[u]\\)-linear codes is exactly the class of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\)-linear codes with automorphism group of even order. Using this characterization, we give examples of known codes, e.g. perfect codes, which have a nontrivial \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_2[u]\\) structure. Moreover, we exhibit some examples of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\)-linear codes which are not \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_2[u]\\)-linear. Also, we state that the duality of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_2[u]\\)-linear codes is the same as the duality of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\)-linear codes. Finally, we prove that the class of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_4\\)-linear codes which are also \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\)-linear is strictly contained in the class of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_2\\mathbb {Z}_2[u]\\)-linear codes.","authors":["Joaquim Borges","Cristina Fernández-Córdoba"],"meta":["August 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography","DOI:10.1007/s10623-017-0401-1"],"references":["308603176_24-additive_cyclic_codes","278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","271665682_On_Z_2_Z_2_u_-additive_codes","263238072_Z2Z4-additive_cyclic_codes_generator_polynomials_and_dual_codes","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","257554406_Z2Z4-linear_codes_Rank_and_kernel","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","3079091_Translation-invariant_propelinear_codes","3078458_The_Z4-linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_related_codes","309057247_Z2Z4-additive_cyclic_codes_generator_polynomials_and_dual_codes","268974567_The_Association_Schemes_of_Coding_Theory","266993354_Atlas_of_Finite_Simple_Groups","265488495_THE_INVOLUTIONS_OP_THE_MATHIEU_GROUPS","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","220686071_Involutions_in_Binary_Perfect_Codes","220685724_Association_Schemes_and_Coding_Theory","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language","3079832_A_characterization_of_1-perfect_additive_codes"]}
