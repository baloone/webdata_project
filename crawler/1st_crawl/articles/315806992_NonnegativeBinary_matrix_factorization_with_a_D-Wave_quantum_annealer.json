{"id":"315806992_NonnegativeBinary_matrix_factorization_with_a_D-Wave_quantum_annealer","abstract":"D-Wave quantum annealers represent a novel computational architecture and have attracted significant interest, but have been used for few real-world computations. Machine learning has been identified as an area where quantum annealing may be useful. Here, we show that the D-Wave 2X can be effectively used as part of an unsupervised machine learning method. This method can be used to analyze large datasets. The D-Wave only limits the number of features that can be extracted from the dataset. We apply this method to learn the features from a set of facial images.","authors":["Daniel Oâ€™Malley","Velimir Vesselinov","B. S. Alexandrov","Ludmil B.
