{"id":"314946314_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","abstract":"Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM) is an extension to elastic graph matching for object classes with a common structure, such as faces in identical pose. All instances of such a class are represented by the same type of graph. From these graphs a bunch graph of same structure is created, with the nodes representing local textures of any object in the class, e.g. all variants of a left eye, and the edges represent average distances between the node locations, e.g. the average distance between the two eyes. This permits taking advantage of the combinatorics of the local textures to represent instances of the object class not seen before. For instance, the textures of the eyes could be taken from one face and the textures of the mouth from another face to represent a new face that shares features with the two stored faces. Thus, a bunch graph is an abstraction for representing object classes rather than individual objects.\nThe desired preselection of model candidates is achieved by a neural network, called the preselection network. Given an input image, it computes an activation for each model image based on the number of feature coincidences. The activations scale proportionally with the probability that the input and the respective model image contain the same object under similar object variations, i.e., the output neurons respond to particular object views. The pre-selection of model candidates is achieved through picking a manageable number of highly activated models. As a second result the preselection network provides a set of coincidental features for each model candidate. The rules to compose these parquet graphs into larger graph entities are provided by their memorized spatial arrangements. Therefore, for each model candidate, the coincidental parquet graph features can be aggregated to an image and a model graph, respectively. These are matched onto each other using EGM. The model graph that yields the highest similarity value is considered to be the best approximation of the object contained in the input image. The method is also capable of aggregating model parquet graph features to bunch graphs. To this end, the model parquet graphs are not just taken from one but from a carefully chosen selection of highly activated model candidates, e.g., from model candidates that belong to the same semantic category. Thus, in a similar way, the method exploits the combinatorics of model parquet graph features like EBGM exploits the combinatorics of the jets in the bunches.","authors":["Laurenz Wiskott","Rolf WÃÂ¼rtz","GÃÂ¼nter Westphal"],"meta":["March 2014Scholarpedia 9(3):10587","DOI:10.4249/scholarpedia.10587","Project: 1993 - 1995 : Face Processing with Elastic Bunch Graph Matching"],"references":["246832896_Low-dimensional_representation_of_faces_in_higher_dimensions_of_the_face_space","220659594_Computation_of_component_image_velocity_from_local_phase_information","19588504_Low-Dimensional_Procedure_for_the_Characterization_of_Human_Faces","14562158_Emergence_of_simple-cell_receptive_field_properties_by_learning_a_sparse_code_for_natural_images","3669554_Tracking_and_learning_graphs_and_pose_on_image_sequences_of_faces","3613049_Face_Recognition_from_One_Example_View","3192712_Object_recognition_robust_under_translations_deformations_and_changes_in_background","3192704_Linear_Object_Classes_and_Image_Synthesis_from_a_Single_Example_Image","3043085_Distortion_Invariant_Object_Recognition_in_the_Dynamic_Link_Architecture","2257431_Learning_Feature_Transformations_to_Recognize_Faces_Rotated_in_Depth","320346068_Face_recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","320345945_Phantom_faces_for_face_analysis","313763919_Application_of_the_karhunen-loeve_procedure_for_the_characterisation_of_human_faces","292812531_Complete_discrete_2-d_gabor_transforms_by_neural_networks_for_image_analysis_and_compression","284053763_FERET_Face_Recognition_Technology_Program","263499383_The_''Independent_Components''_of_Natural_Scenes_are_Edge_Filters","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition","256075301_Deformable_Templates_for_Face_Recognition","247391196_Representation_and_Registration_in_Face_Recognition_and_Medical_Imaging","240174908_Phase-Based_Binocular_Vergence_Control_and_Depth_Reconstruction_Using_Active_Vision","239986693_Face-recognition_from_live_video_for_real-world_applications_now","238379098_Probabilistc_Visual_Learning_For_Object_Reprenta_-_tion","233710354_The_FERET_database_and_evaluation_procedure_for_face-recognition_algorithms","223452203_Connectionist_models_of_face_processing_A_survey","223308678_An_Automatic_Face_Identification_System_Using_Flexible_Appearance_Models","223009662_Automatic_recognition_and_analysis_of_human_faces_and_facial_expressions_A_survey","222756495_Determination_of_face_position_and_pose_with_a_learned_representation_based_on_labelled_graphs","222507042_The_role_of_topographical_constraints_in_face_recognition","220182236_An_Algorithm_for_the_Learning_of_Weights_in_Discrimination_Functions_Using_a_Priori_Constraints","19719670_An_evaluation_of_the_two-dimensional_Gabor_filter_model_of_simple_receptive_fields_in_cat_striate_cortex","15966330_Phase_Relationships_Between_Adjacent_Simple_Cells_in_the_Visual_Cortex","7029425_Improving_object_recognition_by_transforming_Gabor_filter_responses","3560553_Face_recognition_under_varying_pose","2984913_Human_and_Machine_Recognition_of_Faces_A_Survey","2587296_Face_recognition_and_gender_determination","2519028_A_neural_system_for_the_recognition_of_partially_occluded_objects_in_cluttered_scenes","2294079_Synthesis_of_Novel_Views_From_a_Single_Face_Image","2264976_Face_Recognition_using_View-Based_and_Modular_Eigenspaces","2263191_Local_Feature_Analysis_A_general_statistical_theory_for_object_representation"]}
