{"id":"331898966_Sample-Based_Optimal_Pricing","abstract":"Pricing is central to many industries and academic disciplines ranging from Operations Research to Computer Science and Economics. In the present paper, we study data-driven optimal pricing in low informational environments. We analyze the following fundamental problem: how should a decision-maker optimally price based on a single sample of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of customers. The decision-maker's objective is to select a general pricing policy with maximum competitive ratio when the WTP distribution is only known to belong to some broad set. We characterize optimal performance across a spectrum of non-parametric families of distributions, $\\alpha$-strongly regular distributions, two notable special cases being regular and monotone hazard rate distributions. We develop a general approach to obtain structural lower and upper bounds on the maximin ratio characterized by novel dynamic programming value functions. In turn, we develop a tractable procedure to obtain near-optimal mechanisms and near-worst-case distributions, allowing to characterize the maximin ratio for all values of $\\alpha$ in $[0,1]$.\npaper available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3334650","authors":["Amine Allouah","Achraf Bahamou","Omar Besbes"],"meta":["January 2019SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3334650"],"references":["286412671_A_Quantitative_Version_of_Myerson_Regularity","280590328_Randomization_Beats_Second_Price_as_a_Prior-Independent_Auction","333939809_Sample-Based_Optimal_Pricing","333936538_Prophet_Inequalities_for_IID_Random_Variables_from_an_Unknown_Distribution","327803451_Prior-Independent_Optimal_Auctions","325861067_Are_Two_Samples_Really_Better_Than_One","325029790_Making_the_Most_of_Your_Samples","312538489_Revenue_maximization_with_a_single_sample","309750219_Intertemporal_Pricing_Under_Minimax_Regret","276315600_Approximately_optimal_mechanism_design"]}
