{"id":"229336785_Chapter_2_Overall_Reaction_Rate_Equation_of_Single-Route_Complex_Catalytic_Reaction_in_Terms_of_Hypergeometric_Series","abstract":"The non-linear theory of steady-steady (quasi-steady-state/pseudo-steady-state) kinetics of complex catalytic reactions is developed. It is illustrated in detail by the example of the single-route reversible catalytic reaction. The theoretical framework is based on the concept of the kinetic polynomial which has been proposed by authors in 1980–1990s and recent results of the algebraic theory, i.e. an approach of hypergeometric functions introduced by Gel’fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky (1994) and more developed recently by Sturnfels (2000) and Passare and Tsikh (2004). The concept of ensemble of equilibrium subsystems introduced in our earlier papers (see in detail Lazman and Yablonskii, 1991) was used as a physico-chemical and mathematical tool, which generalizes the well-known concept of “equilibrium step”. In each equilibrium subsystem, (n−1) steps are considered to be under equilibrium conditions and one step is limiting (n is a number of steps of the complex reaction). It was shown that all solutions of these equilibrium subsystems define coefficients of the kinetic polynomial.","authors":["Mark Z.
