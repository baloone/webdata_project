{"id":"299983553_Road-based_goods_transportation_A_survey_of_real-world_logistics_applications_from_2000_to_2015","abstract":"The vehicle routing problem has been widely studied from a technical point of view for more than 50 years. Many of its variants are rooted in practical settings. This paper provides a survey of the main real-life applications of road-based goods transportation over the past 15 years. It reviews papers in the areas of oil, gas and fuel transportation, retail, waste collection and management, mail and package delivery and food distribution. Some perspectives on future research and applications are discussed.","authors":["Leandro C Coelho","Jacques Renaud","Gilbert Laporte"],"meta":["April 2016INFOR Information Systems and Operational Research 54(2):1-18","DOI:10.1080/03155986.2016.1167357"],"references":["285833854_Chapter_4_Heuristics_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","269571829_State_of_the_Practice_A_Review_of_the_Application_of_ORMS_in_Freight_Transportation","266912841_Rich_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Survey","265284906_Regional_hubs_and_multimodal_logistics_efficiency_in_the_21st_century","262248127_12_Inventory_Routing_in_Practice","260941176_Exact_Algorithms_for_the_Clustered_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","233960554_Matheuristics_--_Hybridizing_Metaheuristics_and_Mathematical_Programming","233586714_On_a_periodic_vehicle_routing_problem","233515520_Vehicle_routing_with_cross-docking","233506283_Solving_a_vehicle-routing_problem_arising_in_soft-drink_distribution","312458896_Heuristics_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","283623773_Time-Evolving_O-D_Matrix_Estimation_using_high-speed_GPS_data_streams","280611352_The_impact_of_depot_location_fleet_composition_and_routing_on_emissions_in_city_logistics","277970939_Planification_des_tournees_dans_le_domaine_de_la_messagerie_rapide_Vehicle_routing_for_fast_courier_services","276915733_The_production_routing_problem_A_review_of_formulations_and_solution_algorithms","273705594_Vehicle_routing-scheduling_for_municipal_waste_collection_system_under_the_Keep_Trash_off_the_Ground_policy","273111241_Multidepot_Distribution_Planning_at_Logistics_Service_Provide_Nabuurs_BV","273110904_Multidepot_Distribution_Planning_at_Logistics_Service_Provide_Nabuurs_BV","270854217_Strategic_analysis_of_the_dairy_transportation_problem","270396557_Thirty_Years_of_Inventory_Routing","270278635_The_Time-Dependent_Pollution-Routing_Problem","268645053_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_Computational_Study","267308629_Rich_vehicle_routing_problems_From_a_taxonomy_to_a_definition","267109723_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Latest_Advances_and_New_Challenges","266284306_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_and_Its_Variations","265778994_A_savings_based_method_for_real-life_vehicle_routing_problems","265386113_A_multi-compartment_vehicle_routing_problem_arising_in_the_collection_of_olive_oil_in_Tunisia","264340780_Data_Science_Predictive_Analytics_and_Big_Data_A_Revolution_That_Will_Transform_Supply_Chain_Design_and_Management","264161303_An_adaptive_large_neighborhood_search_algorithm_for_a_selective_and_periodic_inventory_routing_problem","263666126_An_Iterated_Local_Search_for_the_Multi_Commodity_Multi_Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","260340772_A_Hybrid_Column_Generation_approach_for_an_Industrial_Waste_Collection_Routing_Problem","259928880_The_Pallet-Packing_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","259125967_Operations_research_in_solid_waste_management_A_survey_of_strategic_and_tactical_issues","257429749_Consistency_in_multi-vehicle_inventory-routing","257196381_Ship_routing_and_scheduling_in_the_new_millennium","256967318_Workforce_Management_in_Periodic_Delivery_Operations","247836247_Port_logistics_platform_integration_in_supply_chain_management","236110447_Streamlining_the_supply_chain_of_the_Hellenic_sugar_industry","236110390_Combining_Linear_Programming_and_Heuristics_to_Solve_a_Transportation_Problem_for_a_Canning_Company_in_Spain","236110119_Modeling_a_vehicle_routine_problem_for_a_soft_drink_distribution_company","235772517_Map-Route_A_GIS-based_decision_support_system_for_intra-city_vehicle_routing_with_time_windows","235772465_Map-Route_a_GIS_-_based_decision_support_system_for_intra-city_vehicle_routing_with_time_windows","235651911_Analysis_and_improvement_of_the_product_delivery_system_of_a_beer_producer_in_Ankara","233883777_A_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multi-trips_and_time_windows_for_circular_items","233843451_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","233843431_Models_and_Algorithms_for_the_Integrated_Planning_of_Bin_Allocation_and_Vehicle_Routing_in_Solid_Waste_Management","233112842_Case_Study","230846906_Rich_Routing_Problems_Arising_in_Supply_Chain_Management","229744511_The_Period_Routing_Problem","229127273_RutaRep_A_computer_package_to_design_dispatching_routes_in_the_meat_industry","226892818_A_Routing_and_Scheduling_System_for_Infectious_Waste_Collection","226056734_Quality_safety_and_sustainability_in_food_distribution_A_review_of_quantitative_operations_management_approaches_and_challenges","227427091_The_Pollution-Routing_Problem","223926348_A_record-to-record_travel_algorithm_for_solving_the_heterogeneous_fleet_vehicle_routing_problem","223852108_A_business-to-business_fleet_management_service_provider_for_central_food_market_enterprises"]}
