{"id":"268441498_FOCALE_-_A_Novel_Autonomic_Networking_Architecture","abstract":"Network resources will always be heterogeneous, and thus have different functionalities and programming models. This can be solved through the combination of information models and knowledge engineering, which together can be used to discover and program semantically similar functionality for heterogeneous devices regardless of the data and language used by each device. This paper introduces FOCALE, a semantically rich architecture for orchestrating the behavior of heterogeneous and distributed computing resources. We apply the FOCALE architecture to Beyond 3G Networks as a case study.","authors":["John Strassner","Nazim Agoulmine","Elyes Lehtihet"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["220641947_Ontology_mapping_for_the_interoperability_problem_in_network_management","4242368_End-to-End_Model_Driven_Policy_Based_Network_Management","2955831_The_Vision_Of_Autonomic_Computing","224645621_Autonomic_Systems_and_Networks_Theory_and_Practice","4174807_Knowledge_Management_Issues_for_Autonomic_Systems","4149710_Autonomic_networking_theory_and_practice"]}
