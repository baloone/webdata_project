{"id":"308815961_More_missing_the_Boat_-_Arduino_Raspberry_Pi_and_small_prototyping_boards_and_engineering_education_needs_them","abstract":"In this work, we describe a range of prototyping boards such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black, and we show how these devices are being used in our ECE curriculum in a range of courses for projects. We describe the continuing challenges we have with adopting such technology from an educational standpoint, and some best practices/techniques we have learned and adopted to include these devices in our courses. We believe integrating these devices into our course flow is of a huge benefit to both our curriculum and our students.","authors":["Peter Jamieson","Jeff Herdtner"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1109/FIE.2015.7344259","Conference: 2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)"],"references":["277289974_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Teaching_Engineering_Design","272089268_Peer_Review_on_Open-Source_Software_Projects_Parameters_Statistical_Models_and_Theory","269936323_Using_Social_Cognitive_Career_Theory_to_Assess_Student_Outcomes_of_Group_Design_Projects_in_Statics","263063836_Engineering_Design_Thinking_Teaching_and_Learning","260834923_Using_Open_Source_Projects_in_Software_Engineering_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","233133205_Academic_alignment_to_reduce_the_presence_of_'social_loafers'_and_'diligent_isolates'_in_student_teams","226593203_Project-Based_Learning_in_Post-Secondary_Education_-_Theory_Practice_and_Rubber_Sling_Shots","220707230_Building_a_framework_for_the_senior_capstone_experience_in_an_information_computer_technology_program","38090858_Preparing_students_for_capstone_design_Senior_Design","4253094_NetFPGA--An_Open_Platform_for_Gigabit-Rate_Network_Switching_and_Routing","3051170_Best_Practices_Involving_Teamwork_in_the_Classroom_Results_From_a_Survey_of_6435_Engineering_Student_Respondents","3050934_A_Project-Based_Learning_Approach_to_Design_Electronic_Systems_Curricula","3050788_An_introductory_digital_design_course_using_a_low-cost_autonomous_robot","266316641_Processing_A_Programming_Handbook_for_Visual_Designers_and_Artists","264847224_Arduino_for_Teaching_Embedded_Systems_Are_Computer_Scientists_and_Engineering_Educators_Missing_the_Boat","262174536_Integrating_microcontrollers_in_undergraduate_curriculum","260587267_A_Project-Based_Learning_Approach_to_Programmable_Logic_Design_and_Computer_Architecture","259539010_Team_Effectiveness_Theory_from_Industrial_and_Organizational_Psychology_Applied_to_Engineering_Student_Project_Teams_A_Research_Review","255599814_A_project_Based_Methodology_to_Teach_a_C_ourse_on_Advanced_Digital_Systems_Design","241633007_Integrating_Open_Source_Software_into_software_engineering_curriculum_Challenges_in_selecting_projects","238162544_A_Review_of_Research_on_Project-Based_Learning","234787568_The_use_of_free_and_open_source_software_in_real-world_capstone_projects","234779975_Agile_Software_Development_Principles_Patterns_and_Practices","224748869_Impacting_education_using_FPGAs","224088804_Using_software_defined_radio_SDR_to_demonstrate_concepts_in_communications_and_signal_processing_courses","221538067_Linux_kernel_projects_for_an_undergraduate_operating_systems_course","44828922_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_a_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives","4054755_Teaching_software_design_with_open_source_software","3923387_A_first_course_in_digital_design_using_VHDL_and_programmable_logic","3050879_Using_an_integrated_platform_for_Learning_TM_to_reinvent_engineering_education","3050616_An_interdisciplinary_laboratory_sequence_in_electrical_and_computer_engineering_Curriculum_design_and_assessment_results"]}
