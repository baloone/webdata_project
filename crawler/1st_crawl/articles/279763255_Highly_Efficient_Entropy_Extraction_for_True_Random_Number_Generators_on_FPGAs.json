{"id":"279763255_Highly_Efficient_Entropy_Extraction_for_True_Random_Number_Generators_on_FPGAs","abstract":"True random number generators are essential components in cryptographic hardware. In this work, a novel entropy extraction method is used to improve throughput of jitter-based true random number generators on FPGA. By utilizing ultra-fast carry-logic primitives available on most commercial FPGAs, we have improved the efficiency of the entropy extraction, thereby increasing the throughput, while maintaining a compact implementation. Design steps and techniques are illustrated on an example of a ring-oscillator based true random number generator implemented on Spartan-6. In this design, the required accumulation time is reduced by 3 orders of magnitude compared to the most efficient oscillator-based TRNG on the same FPGA. The presented implementation occupies only 67 slices, achieves a throughput of 14.3 Mbps and it is provided with a formal evaluation of security.","authors":["Vladimir Rozic","Bohan Yang","Wim Dehaene","Ingrid Verbauwhede"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2744769.2744852","Conference: Desigh Automation Conference (DAC 2015)At: San Francisco, USAVolume: 52"],"references":["262202755_A_Very_High_Speed_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Entropy_Assessment","226148194_High-Speed_True_Random_Number_Generation_with_Logic_Gates_Only","221291617_New_High_Entropy_Element_for_FPGA_based_True_Random_Number_Generators","4341841_Modeling_and_Observing_the_Jitter_in_Ring_Oscillators_Implemented_in_FPGAs","269311203_On_the_assumption_of_mutual_independence_of_jitter_realizations_in_P-TRNG_stochastic_models","254052945_A_multi-channel_10ps_resolution_FPGA-based_TDC_with_300MSs_throughput_for_open-source_PET_applications","235090427_A_Statistical_Test_Suite_for_Random_and_Pseudorandom_Number_Generators_for_Cryptographic_Applications","224056555_FPGA_Vendor_Agnostic_True_Random_Number_Generator","220331462_A_Provably_Secure_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Built-In_Tolerance_to_Active_Attacks","3049437_A_Provably_Secure_True_Random_Number_Generator_with_Built-In_Tolerance_to_Active_Attacks"]}
