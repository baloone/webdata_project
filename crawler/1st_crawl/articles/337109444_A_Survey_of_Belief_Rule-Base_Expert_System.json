{"id":"337109444_A_Survey_of_Belief_Rule-Base_Expert_System","abstract":"The belief rule-base (BRB) model is a new intelligent expert system with the characteristics of both expert system and data-driven model. In BRB there are many if-then rules which use belief degrees to express various types of uncertain information, including fuzziness, randomness, and ignorance. As a semi-quantitative modeling tool for complex systems, BRB has the superiorities of dealing both numerical quantitative data and linguistic qualitative knowledge that are derived from heterogeneous sources. Moreover, it is also a white box approach which can provide direct access and transparency to decision makers and stakeholders. Currently, BRB has been widely applied in many fields, such as decision making, reliability evaluation, network security situation awareness, fault diagnosis, and so on. To fully demonstrate the progress of BRB, the original BRB, and some evolution forms are introduced in this article.","authors":["Zhi-Jie Zhou","Guan-Yu Hu","Changhua hu","Cheng-Lin Wen"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems PP(99):1-15","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2019.2944893"],"references":[]}
