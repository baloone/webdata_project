{"id":"343428416_Sequential_Difference-of-Convex_Programming","abstract":"Optimization methods for difference-of-convex programs iteratively solve convex subproblems to define iterates. Although convex, depending on the problem’s structure, these subproblems are very often challenging and require specialized solvers. This work investigates a new methodology that defines iterates as approximate critical points of significantly easier difference-of-convex subproblems approximating the original one. Since there is considerable freedom to choose such more accessible subproblems, several algorithms can be designed from the given approach. In some cases, the resulting algorithm boils down to a straightforward process with iterates given in an analytic form. In other situations, decomposable subproblems can be chosen, opening the way for parallel computing even when the original program is not decomposable. Depending on the problem’s assumptions, a possible variant of the given approach is the Josephy–Newton method applied to the system of (necessary) optimality conditions of the original difference-of-convex program. In such a setting, local convergence with superlinear and even quadratic rates can be achieved under certain conditions.","authors":["Welington de Oliveira"],"meta":["September 2020Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 186(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10957-020-01721-x"],"references":["340281307_Using_Positive_Spanning_Sets_to_Achieve_d-Stationarity_with_the_Boosted_DC_Algorithm","337489656_SVM-Based_Multiple_Instance_Classification_via_DC_Optimization","334857198_Classification_in_the_multiple_instance_learning_framework_via_spherical_separation","331872438_Nonsmooth_and_Nonconvex_Optimization_via_Approximate_Difference-of-Convex_Decompositions","331405671_Proximal_bundle_methods_for_nonsmooth_DC_programming","328514937_An_Inertial_Algorithm_for_DC_Programming","324506174_Bundle-based_descent_method_for_nonsmooth_multiobjective_DC_optimization_with_inequality_constraints","326051806_Double_Bundle_Method_for_finding_Clarke_Stationary_Points_in_Nonsmooth_DC_Programming","325378808_Minimizing_Piecewise-Concave_Functions_Over_Polyhedra","322694621_DC_programming_and_DCA_thirty_years_of_developments","319683780_Minimizing_nonsmooth_DC_functions_via_successive_DC_piecewise-affine_approximations","317673413_On_Quadratic_Convergence_of_DC_Proximal_Newton_Algorithm_for_Nonconvex_Sparse_Learning_in_High_Dimensions","311855067_A_proximal_bundle_method_for_nonsmooth_DC_optimization_utilizing_nonconvex_cutting_planes","313591186_Convex_analysis_approaches_to_DC_programming_Theory_algorithms_and_applications","309228950_Convex_Analysis_and_Global_Optimization"]}
