{"id":"344190635_Some_New_p_1_p_2_q_1_q_2_-Estimates_of_Ostrowski-type_integral_inequalities_via_n-polynomials_s-type_convexity","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to establish new generalization of Ostrowski type integral inequalities by using (p, q)-analogues which are related to the estimates of upper bound for a class of (p 1 p 2 , q 1 q 2)-differentiable functions on coordinates. We first establish an integral identity for (p 1 p 2 , q 1 q 2)-differentiable functions on coordinates. The result is then used to derive some estimates of upper bound for the functions whose twice partial (p 1 p 2 , q 1 q 2)-differentiable functions are n-polynomial s-type convex functions on coordinates. Some new special cases from the main results are obtained and some known results are recaptured as well. At the end, an application to special means is given as well.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Muhammad Idrees","Artion Kashuri","Muhammad Uzair Awan"],"meta":["September 2020AIMS Mathematics 5(6):7122-7144","DOI:10.3934/math.2020456","Project: Quantum Integral Inequalities"],"references":["343855026_On_some_fractional_integral_inequalities_for_generalized_strongly_modified_H-convex_functions","343844889_Bounds_for_the_Remainder_in_Simpson's_Inequality_via_-Polynomial_Convex_Functions_of_Higher_Order_Using_Katugampola_Fractional_Integrals","343692041_A_variant_of_Jensen-type_inequality_and_related_results_for_harmonic_convex_functions","343667234_Estimates_of_quantum_bounds_pertaining_to_new_q-integral_identity_with_applications","343654446_Some_Trapezium-Like_Inequalities_Involving_Functions_Having_Strongly_-Polynomial_Preinvexity_Property_of_Higher_Order","343515523_Fractional_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_Inequalities_Associated_with_Exponentially_s_m_-Convex_Functions","343509217_Fractional_generalized_Hadamard_and_Fejer-Hadamard_inequalities_for_m-convex_functions","343449070_Some_new_local_fractional_inequalities_associated_with_generalized_s_m-convex_functions_and_applications","343258757_Revisiting_the_Hermite-Hadamard_fractional_integral_inequality_via_a_Green_function","343313072_Sharp_rational_bounds_for_the_gamma_function"]}
