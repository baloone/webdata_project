{"id":"312411369_Dynamic_management_of_data_warehouse_security_levels_based_on_user_profiles","abstract":"Respect for privacy and data confidentiality in a company are two fundamentals that must be protected. However, a Data Warehouse can be used as a very powerful mechanism for discovering crucial information, hence the importance of implementing security measures which guarantee the data confidentiality by establishing an access control policy. In this direction, several propositions were made, however, none is considered as a standard of access management to data warehouses. In this article, we will present our approach that allows first to exploit the permissions defined in the data sources in order to help the administrator to define access permissions to the data warehouse, and then our system will automatically generate the sensitivity level of each data warehouse element according to the permissions granted to an object in the data warehouse.","authors":["Amina El Ouazzani","Sara Rhazlane","Nouria Harbi","Badir Hassan"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/CIST.2016.7804961","Conference: 2016 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology (CIST)"],"references":[]}
