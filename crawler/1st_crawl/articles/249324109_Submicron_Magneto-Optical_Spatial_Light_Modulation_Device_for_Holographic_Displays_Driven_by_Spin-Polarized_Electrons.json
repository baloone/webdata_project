{"id":"249324109_Submicron_Magneto-Optical_Spatial_Light_Modulation_Device_for_Holographic_Displays_Driven_by_Spin-Polarized_Electrons","abstract":"We have proposed a spin transfer switching (STS MO-SLM) device, based on\nMagneto-optical (MO) spatial light-modulation and driven by spin-polarized current flow,\nand confirmed its basic operation and characteristics experimentally. The proposed SLM\ndevice can be operated without active-matrix devices, has a spatial resolution as small\nas several hundred nanometers and possesses the potential for being driven at ultra-high\nspeed of several tens of nanoseconds. Unlike existing SLM devices, this device satisfies\nboth the size and speed requirements of SLMs for use in displaying holographic\nthree-dimensional (3D) moving images. To improve the light modulation characteristics of\nSLM device, we carried out studies on magnetic films with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy to obtain large magneto-optical signals, which enabled us to realize enhanced\nlight modulation performance. In addition, we measured a MO signal that was about\ntwenty-times larger than that possible with in-plane anisotropy. We conclude that the\nMO-SLM device that we are developing is suitable for displaying future super-high\ndefinition, holographic three-dimensional moving images.","authors":["Ken-ichi Aoshima","Nobuhiko Funabashi","Kenji Machida","Yasuyoshi Miyamoto"],"meta":["September 2010Journal of Display Technology 6(9):374-380","DOI:10.1109/JDT.2010.2058998"],"references":["234939575_Magneto-optical_imaging_using_polarization_modulation_method","271119636_Ultrahigh-Definition_Video_System_with_4000_Scanning_Lines","260929984_Advances_in_holographic_video","252774029_Subnanosecond_magnetization_reversal_in_magnetic_nanopillars_by_spin_angular_momentum_transfer","252349997_Real-time_holography_using_the_high-resolution_LCTV-SLM","243784896_Three-dimensional_video_system_based_on_integral_photography","243292342_Current_induced_magnetization_reversal_in_spin_valves_with_Heusler_alloys","234998460_ISTSPIE's_Symposium_on_Electronic_Imaging_Science_and_Technology","234958693_Spin_transfer_switching_in_TbCoFeCoFeBMgOCoFeBTbCoFe_magnetic_tunnel_junctions_with_perpendicular_magnetic_anisotropy","234914119_Spin_transfer_switching_of_closely_arranged_multiple_pillars_with_current-perpendicular-to-plane_spin_valves"]}
