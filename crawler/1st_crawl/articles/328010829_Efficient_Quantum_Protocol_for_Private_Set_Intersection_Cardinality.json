{"id":"328010829_Efficient_Quantum_Protocol_for_Private_Set_Intersection_Cardinality","abstract":"Recently, we proposed a quantum solution to the problem of Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA) (Information Sciences 370-371 (2016) 147-158). Compared to classical solutions, the proposed quantum PSI-CA protocol achieves an exponential reduction in communication complexity, since it only needs communication cost. However, this protocol requires two additional assumptions about the cardinalities of the sets, which may limit its wider applications. In this paper, we successfully discard these assumptions and present a stronger quantum PSI-CA protocol without any limitation. The new protocol ensures the partiesâ€™ private security, i.e., unconditionally secure Server Privacy and statistically secure Client Privacy, and it achieves the constant computation and communication complexities, which are independent of the size of the sets. Therefore, it is more suitable for practical applications with big data sets.","authors":["Run-hua Shi"],"meta":["October 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872741"],"references":["304337838_Experimental_Quantum_Multiparty_Communication_Protocols","282469047_Scheme_for_purifying_a_general_mixed_entangled_state_and_its_linear_optical_implementation","280695821_Implementation_of_Quantum_and_Classical_Discrete_Fractional_Fourier_Transforms","261959191_One-step_implementation_of_quantum_controlled-phase_gate_via_quantum_Zeno_dynamics","258839919_Realization_of_Quantum_Digital_Signatures_without_the_Requirement_of_Quantum_Memory","233873239_Complete_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Protocols_for_Classical_Two-Party_Computation","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","224678299_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_with_Only_a_Strict_Honest_Majority","221655467_Location_Privacy_via_Private_Proximity_Testing","2202982_Quantum_Counting","314829083_Secure_multi-party_quantum_computation","312551281_Privacy-preserving_set_operations","305729247_Quantum_Private_Set_Intersection_Cardinality_and_its_Application_to_Anonymous_Authentication","281581214_Analysis-Preserving_Protection_of_User_Privacy_against_Information_Leakage_of_Social-Network_Likes","276173099_Implementation_of_a_Remote_Three-Qubit_Controlled-Z_Gate_via_Quantum_Zeno_Dynamics","267627456_Fast_and_noise-resistant_implementation_of_quantum_phase_gates_and_creation_of_quantum_entangled_states","265731154_Optimal_bipartite_entanglement_transfer_and_photonic_implementations","264241595_Secure_multiparty_computation_of_solid_geometric_problems_and_their_applications","262342226_Quantum_state_secure_transmission_in_network_communications","262305147_A_communication-efficient_private_matching_scheme_in_Client-Server_model","257641704_Quantum_private_comparison_against_decoherence_noise","257572486_Fault-Tolerate_Quantum_Private_Comparison_Based_on_GHZ_States_and_ECC","257507069_Quantum_Counting_Algorithm_and_Error_Distribution","234527627_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_high-dimension_quantum_superdense_coding","225539918_Polynomial_time_algorithms_for_discrete_logarithms_and_factoring_on_a_quantum_computer","221499819_Protocols_for_Secure_Computations_Extended_Abstract","220065531_Secure_set_intersection_cardinality_with_application_to_association_rule_mining","8538038_Cheat_Sensitive_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","2751462_Teleporting_an_Unknown_Quantum_State_via_Dual_Classical_and_EPR_Channels","2355676_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Secure_Computations","1761136_The_Impossibility_Of_Secure_Two-Party_Classical_Computation"]}
