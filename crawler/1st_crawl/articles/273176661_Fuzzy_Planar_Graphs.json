{"id":"273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"Fuzzy planar graph is a very important subclass of fuzzy graph. In this paper, two types of edges are mentioned for fuzzy graphs, namely effective edges and considerable edges. Also, a comparative study between Kuratowskiâ€™s graphs and fuzzy planar graph is made. A new concept of strong fuzzy planar graph is introduced. Some related results are established. These results have certain applications in subway tunnels, routes, oil/gas pipelines representation, etc. It is also shown that an image can be represented by a fuzzy planar graph and contraction of such image can be made with the help of fuzzy planar graph.","authors":["Sovan Samanta","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["December 2015IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems 23(6):1936-1942","DOI:10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2387875","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["312092976_FUZZY_DUAL_GRAPH","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","275605693_New_concepts_of_fuzzy_planar_graph","267961207_Fuzzy_Effective_Distance_K-Dominating_sets_and_their_applications","264348084_Interval-valued_fuzzy_planar_graphs","262642148_m_step_fuzzy_competition_graph","261146729_Fuzzy_k-competition_graphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","268550632_Fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs"]}
