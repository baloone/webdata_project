{"id":"348705128_A_Novel_Trust_Model_for_Secure_Group_Communication_in_Distributed_Computing","abstract":"Distributed networks are networks in which each node can act as a server or client and hence any node can provide service to any other node. In such a scenario, establishing a trust model between the service providing user and the service utilizing user is a challenging task. At present, only a few approaches are available in the past literature to provide this facility. Moreover, the existing approaches do not provide high trust accuracy. Therefore,a novel efficient trust model has been proposed in this article to support the secure dynamic group communication in distributed networks. The main advantage of the proposed work is that it provides higher trust accuracy. Moreover, the proposed work takes less memory for maintaining the trust values and increases the packet delivery ratio in comparison with other existing works which are in the literature.","authors":["R.
