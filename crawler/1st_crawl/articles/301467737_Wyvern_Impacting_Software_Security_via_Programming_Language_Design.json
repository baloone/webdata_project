{"id":"301467737_Wyvern_Impacting_Software_Security_via_Programming_Language_Design","abstract":"Breaches of software security affect millions of people, and therefore it is crucial to strive for more secure software systems. However, the effect of programming language design on software security is not easily measured or studied. In the absence of scientific insight, opinions range from those that claim that programming language design has no effect on security of the system, to those that believe that programming language design is the only way to provide \"high-assurance software.\" In this paper, we discuss how programming language design can impact software security by looking at a specific example: the Wyvern programming language. We report on how the design of the Wyvern programming language leverages security principles, together with hypotheses about how usability impacts security, in order to prevent command injection attacks. Furthermore, we discuss what security principles we considered in Wyvern's design.","authors":["Darya Kurilova","Alex Potanin","Jonathan Aldrich"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1145/2688204.2688216","Conference: the 5th Workshop"],"references":["300430800_Safely_Composable_Type-Specific_Languages","266658409_Type-specific_languages_to_fight_injection_attacks","262310220_Wyvern_a_simple_typed_and_pure_object-oriented_language","2994185_The_Protection_of_Information_in_Computer_Systems"]}
