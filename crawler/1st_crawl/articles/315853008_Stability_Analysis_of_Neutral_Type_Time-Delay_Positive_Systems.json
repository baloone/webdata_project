{"id":"315853008_Stability_Analysis_of_Neutral_Type_Time-Delay_Positive_Systems","abstract":"This chapter is concerned with asymptotic stability analysis of neutral type time-delay positive systems (TDPSs). We focus on a neutral type TDPS represented by a feedback system constructed from a finite-dimensional LTI positive system and the pure delay, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability. In the case where we deal with a retarded type TDPS, i.e., if the direct-feedthrough term of the finite-dimensional LTI positive system is zero, it is well known that the retarded type TDPS is stable if and only if its delay-free finite-dimensional counterpart is stable. In the case of neutral type TDPS, i.e., if the direct-feedthrough term is nonzero, however, we clarify that the neutral type TDPS is stable if and only if its delay-free finite-dimensional counterpart is stable and the direct-feedthrough term is Schur stable. Namely, we need additional condition on the direct-feedthrough term.","authors":["Yoshio Ebihara","Naoya Nishio","Tomomichi Hagiwara"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54211-9_6","In book: Positive Systems (pp.67-80)"],"references":["263285681_On_the_Stabilizability_and_Consensus_of_Positive_Homogeneous_Multi-Agent_Dynamical_Systems","260661819_Co-Positive_Lyapunov_Functions_for_the_Stabilization_of_Positive_Switched_Systems","260028816_LL-gain_analysis_for_positive_systems_with_distributed_delays","259738596_Robust_stability_and_stabilization_of_uncertain_Linear_Positive_Systems_via_Integral_Linear_Constraints_-_L_1-_and_L_infty-gains_characterizations","259504186_Non-existence_of_finite-time_stable_equilibria_in_fractional-order_nonlinear_systems","241636769_L1_gain_analysis_of_linear_positive_systems_and_its_application","222524384_Stability_theory_for_nonnegative_and_compartmental_dynamical_systems_with_delay","3032757_On_the_Stability_of_Switched_Positive_Linear_Systems","313744983_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Interconnected_Positive_Systems","302581064_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_Lemma_for_Positive_Systems","277219888_Theory_of_Functional_Differential_Equation","276152611_Scalable_Control_of_Positive_Systems","275237182_Spectrum_of_Monodromy_Operator_for_a_Time-Delay_System_With_Application_to_Stability_Analysis","270498111_Differential-Difference_Equations","263495020_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_lemma_for_discrete-time_positive_linear_systems_A_novel_simple_proof_and_some_related_results","257388256_Estimation_of_linear_positive_systems_with_unknown_time-varying_delays","257200203_Topics_in_Matrix_Analysis","242987233_An_alternative_proof_of_the_Barker_Berman_Plemmons_BBP_result_on_diagonal_stability_and_extensions","233479527_Concatenated_solutions_of_delay-differential_equations_and_their_representation_with_time-delay_feedback_systems","230872602_Differential-Difference_Equations","225075430_Positive_linear_systems_Theory_and_applications","220387153_The_Bounded_Real_Lemma_for_Internally_Positive_Systems_and_H-Infinity_Structured_Static_State_Feedback","3032814_On_Linear_Copositive_Lyapunov_Functions_and_the_Stability_of_Switched_Positive_Linear_Systems"]}
