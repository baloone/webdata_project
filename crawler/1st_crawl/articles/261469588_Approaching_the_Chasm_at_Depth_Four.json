{"id":"261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","abstract":"Agrawal and Vinay [2008], Koiran [2012], and Tavenas [2013] have recently shown that an exp (ω(√n log n)) lower bound for depth four homogeneous circuits computing the permanent with bottom layer of × gates having fanin bounded by √n translates to a superpolynomial lower bound for general arithmetic circuits computing the permanent. Motivated by this, we examine the complexity of computing the permanent and determinant via such homogeneous depth four circuits with bounded bottom fanin.\nWe show here that any homogeneous depth four arithmetic circuit with bottom fanin bounded by √n computing the permanent (or the determinant) must be of size exp,(Ω(√n)).","authors":["Ankit Gupta","Pritish Kamath","Neeraj Kayal","Ramprasad Saptharishi"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of the ACM 61(6):65-73","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2013.16","Conference: Computational Complexity (CCC), 2013 IEEE Conference on"],"references":["261469582_Random_Arithmetic_Formulas_Can_Be_Reconstructed_Efficiently","227189452_Exponential_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits_in_Algebras_of_Functions_over_Finite_Fields","220365641_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_survey_of_recent_results_and_open_questions","220138291_Affine_projections_of_polynomials","2413379_Depth-3_Arithmetic_Circuits_over_Fields_of_Characteristic_Zero","2241304_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits","314007348_Ideals_Varieties_and_Algorithms","266037398_Stirling's_Approximation_for_n_The_Ultimate_Short_Proof","246543941_The_irreducibility_of_ladder_determinantal_varieties","243045202_Ideals_of_generic_minors","241623663_Affine_projections_of_polynomials_extended_abstract","225806185_Lower_Bounds_and_Separations_for_Constant_Depth_Multilinear_Circuits","225702151_Grobner_bases_and_Stanley_decompositions_of_determinantal_rings","224354119_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra","45925555_Arithmetic_circuits_The_chasm_at_depth_four_gets_wider","3635348_Lower_Bounds_on_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Derivatives","2893455_Multi-Linear_Formulas_for_Permanent_and_Determinant_Are_of_Super-Polynomial_Size"]}
