{"id":"341350027_Signal_Quality_Evaluation_of_Single-period_Radial_Artery_Pulse_Wave_Based_on_Machine_Learning_Preprint","abstract":"Background: \nThe radial artery pulse wave is a widely used physiological signal for disease diagnosis and personal health monitoring because it provides insight into the overall health of the heart and blood vessels. Periodic radial artery pulse signals are subsequently decomposed into single pulse wave periods (segments) for physiological parameter evaluations. However, abnormal periods frequently arise due to external interference, the inherent imperfections of current segmentation methods, and the quality of the pulse wave signals.\n\nObjective: \nThe objective of this paper was to develop a machine learning model to detect abnormal pulse periods in real clinical data.\n\nMethods: \nVarious machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and support vector machines, were applied to classify the normal and abnormal periods in 8561 segments extracted from the radial pulse waves of 390 outpatients. The recursive feature elimination method was used to simplify the classifier.\n\nResults: \nIt was found that a logistic regression model with only four input features can achieve a satisfactory result. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the test set was 0.9920. In addition, these classifiers can be easily interpreted.\n\nConclusions: \nWe expect that this model can be applied in smart sport watches and watchbands to accurately evaluate human health status.","authors":["Xiaodong Ding","Feng Cheng","Robert Morris","Cong Chen"],"meta":["February 2020JMIR Medical Informatics 8(6)","DOI:10.2196/18134"],"references":["336712023_Atrial_Fibrillation_Detection_from_Wrist_Photoplethysmography_Signals_Using_Smartwatches","333072075_Wearable_devices_for_cardiac_arrhythmia_detection_a_new_contender","329381378_Cuffless_Blood_Pressure_Estimation_Using_Pressure_Pulse_Wave_Signals","327658856_Patient-specific_pulse_wave_propagation_model_identifies_cardiovascular_risk_characteristics_in_hemodialysis_patients","334732281_A_Noninvasive_Economical_and_Instant-Result_Method_to_Diagnose_and_Monitor_Type_2_Diabetes_Using_Pulse_Wave_Case-Control_Study","332176358_Diagnosis_of_traditional_Chinese_medicine_constitution_by_integrating_indices_of_the_tongue_the_acoustic_sound_and_the_pulse","327494723_The_use_of_time-domain_analysis_on_the_choice_of_measurement_location_for_pulse_diagnosis_research_A_pilot_study","313107133_Diagnostics_of_traditional_Chinese_medicine_Beijing_China_Press_of_Traditional_Chinese","312680131_Traditional_Chinese_Medicine","285675149_Outlier_Pulse_Detection_and_Feature_Extraction_for_Wrist_Pulse_Analysis"]}
