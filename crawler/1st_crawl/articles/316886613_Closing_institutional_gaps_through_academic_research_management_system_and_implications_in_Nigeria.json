{"id":"316886613_Closing_institutional_gaps_through_academic_research_management_system_and_implications_in_Nigeria","abstract":"The world today has a number of valuable research scholars desiring connections and collaborations. The existing online collaboration platforms are not sufficient to accommodate the totality of researchers desiring dynamic platforms to network globally. Despite growing contributions in the literature on Social Network Site (SNS), regarding the capacity to connect people remotely, there is still a dearth of research on how SNS potentially integrates academics into social capital formation. The objective of this study is to provide Academic Research Management System (ARMS) for the research community. The research methods that were employed for the study include unified modeling language (UML) for the design; and Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and MySQL for front end, server side programming and database respectively. The system was evaluated for usability and the implications for deploying the ARMS in Nigeria were also considered in this study. Findings: The findings from the usability survey showed a good usability based on total rating of 4.10 out of 5 point scale. The integration of the system into the academic institutions worldwide would foster a rapport between academics in all fields of learning and provide a means to have access to colleagues and research materials when needed.
