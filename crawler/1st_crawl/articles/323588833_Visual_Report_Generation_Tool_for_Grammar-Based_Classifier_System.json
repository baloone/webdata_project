{"id":"323588833_Visual_Report_Generation_Tool_for_Grammar-Based_Classifier_System","abstract":"Grammar-based Classifier System (GCS) is one of the evolutionary approached context-free grammar induction methods. Any learning process creates a large amount of data, which is hard to analyze in a raw form. In the present paper we aim to present a reporting tool, created to facilitate analysis and conclusion drawing by presenting learning data in a neat and readable form, yet fully conveying its complexity. © 2018 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology.","authors":["Olgierd Unold","Agnieszka Kaczmarek","Łukasz Culer"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.18178/ijmlc.2018.8.1.667"],"references":["234809540_Grammatical_inference_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","221346039_GA-based_Learning_of_Context-Free_Grammars_using_Tabular_Representations","313077576_Escaping_brittleness_The_possibilities_of_general_purpose_learning_algorithms_applied_to_parallel_rule-based_systems","267122432_Context-free_grammar_induction_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","222191456_Recognition_and_Parsing_of_Context_Free_Languages_in_Time_n3","221309033_Playing_a_Toy-Grammar_with_GCS"]}
