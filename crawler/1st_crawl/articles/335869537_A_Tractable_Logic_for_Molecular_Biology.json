{"id":"335869537_A_Tractable_Logic_for_Molecular_Biology","abstract":"We introduce a logic for knowledge representation and reasoning on protein-protein interactions. Modulo a theory, formulas describe protein structures and dynamic changes. They can be composed in order to add or remove static and dynamic observations. A second-order circumscription operator then enables nonmonotonic reasoning on the changes implied by a formula. We introduce deduction rules that produce formulas which are, up to equivalence, in a first-order fragment with decidable satisfiability and validity. Importantly, the rules can produce circumscribed formulas.","authors":["Adrien Husson","Jean Krivine"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.306.17"],"references":["326100673_The_Kappa_platform_for_rule-based_modeling","322991344_UniProt_the_universal_protein_knowledgebase","280221896_DARPA's_Big_Mechanism_program","269019258_Elimination_of_Predicate_Quantifiers","235427894_UniProt_the_Universal_Protein_Knowledgebase","307585018_Mathematical_Logic_for_Systems_Biology_Invited_Paper","268979021_Reasoning_with_Incomplete_Information_Investigations_of_Non--Monotonic_Reasoning","245982066_Dynamic_Logic_in_Handbook_of_Philosophical_Logic_II","244956056_A_form_of_non-monotonic_reasoning","242351238_The_Frame_Problem_in_the_Situation_Calculus_A_Simple_Solution_Sometimes_and_a_Completeness_Result_for_Goal_Regression","232753127_Serine_and_tyrosine_phosphorylations_cooperate_in_Raf-1_but_not_B-Raf_activation","223972754_The_BioPAX_community_standard_for_pathway_data_sharing","221176581_Towards_a_Logical_Analysis_of_Biochemical_Pathways","229422909_The_BioPAX_community_standard_for_pathway_data_sharing","222441371_Applications_of_Circumscription_to_Formalizing_Common_Sense_Knowledge"]}
