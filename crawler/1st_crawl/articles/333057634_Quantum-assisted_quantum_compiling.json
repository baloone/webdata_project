{"id":"333057634_Quantum-assisted_quantum_compiling","abstract":"Compiling quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers (accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost on a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling (QAQC). In QAQC, we use the overlap between a target unitary U and a trainable unitary V as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More precisely, to ensure that QAQC scales well with problem size, our cost involves not only the global overlap Tr(Vâ€ U) but also the local overlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth quantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that our cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under reasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and gradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost. As a demonstration of QAQC, we compile various one-qubit gates on IBM's and Rigetti's quantum computers into their respective native gate alphabets. Furthermore, we successfully simulate QAQC up to a problem size of 9 qubits, and these simulations highlight both the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of QAQC. Future applications of QAQC include algorithm depth compression, black-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.","authors":["Sumeet Khatri","Ryan LaRose","Alexander Poremba","Lukasz Cincio"],"meta":["May 2019Quantum 3:140","DOI:10.22331/q-2019-05-13-140"],"references":["334037097_Variational_quantum_state_diagonalization","326596523_Quantum_compiling_with_diffusive_sets_of_gates","324104887_Barren_plateaus_in_quantum_neural_network_training_landscapes","324104666_The_Glassy_Phase_of_Optimal_Quantum_Control","323867333_Comparing_and_Integrating_Constraint_Programming_and_Temporal_Planning_for_Quantum_Circuit_Compilation","323722413_Learning_the_quantum_algorithm_for_state_overlap","330099792_Optimizing_quantum_optimization_algorithms_via_faster_quantum_gradient_computation","325623598_Greedy_Randomized_Search_for_Scalable_Compilation_of_Quantum_Circuits","325212657_Impossibility_of_Classically_Simulating_One-Clean-Qubit_Model_with_Multiplicative_Error","323549997_Quantum_Circuit_Learning"]}
