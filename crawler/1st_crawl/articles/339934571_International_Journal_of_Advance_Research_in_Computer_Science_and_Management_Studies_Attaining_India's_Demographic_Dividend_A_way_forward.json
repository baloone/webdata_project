{"id":"339934571_International_Journal_of_Advance_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Management_Studies_Attaining_India's_Demographic_Dividend_A_way_forward","abstract":"In this era of development and transition phase the growing economies of the countries, come across demographic change, known as \"Demographic dividend\". The dividends are associated with the population composition of any economy. However, this cannot be achieved without framing proper guidelines for absorbing the potential workforce of the country into productive workforce. While in most of the economies, including India, emphasis is being done on laying proper framework for implementing the policies but still inclusive growth of all the sectors of the economy remains a distant desire. In order to reap full benefits of demographic dividend, the country will have to intensify their focus on health, education and other areas. In this research paper, we will emphasise the factors which are connected with yielding the benefits of demographic dividend and the framework essentially required in India for its development as a whole.","authors":["Pallavi Mathur","Parul Agarwal"],"meta":["March 2020"],"references":["279162053_India_Defining_and_Explaining_Inclusive_Growth_and_Poverty_Reduction","253969063_Understanding_the_Demographic_Dividend","248422666_What_is_the_Demographic_Dividend","5212989_Strategies_for_Pro-Poor_Growth_Pro-Poor_Pro-Growth_or_Both"]}
