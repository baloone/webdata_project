{"id":"329288081_Map_Matching_Algorithm_Trajectory_and_Sequential_Map_Analysis_on_Road_Network","abstract":"The Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data is essential for sensor data sources. It plays an important role for various systems like Traﬃc assessment and Prediction, routing and navigation, Fleet management etc. Trajectory data accuracy is key factor for sampling based vehicle movement using existing GPS alerting systems. GPS navigation process is not reliable because of weak signaling transmission, weather scenario, specially, tall buildings area and drass sectors in Indian scenario. Map matching ﬁnding a path between available points on the active road segment, enhance road data accuracy through minimize frechet distance for future purpose. Therefore, accurate road data, become necessary for fast map matching outcomes. This work provides to locate the frechet distance on available free space for accurate path ﬁnding. This work also contributes to measuring frechet distance, trajectory data error estimation and ﬁnding free space surface on road network with sequential map computational method.","authors":["Kanta Prasad Sharma","Ramesh Chandra","Raghvendra Kumar","Surendra Sunda"],"meta":["November 2018Industrial Networks and Intelligent Systems 5(16):155999","DOI:10.4108/eai.29-11-2018.155999"],"references":["323908071_Towards_lane-level_traffic_monitoring_in_urban_environment_using_precise_probe_vehicle_data_derived_from_three-dimensional_map_aided_differential_GNSS","323273439_Map_matching_algorithm_curve_simplification_for_Frechet_distance_computing_and_precise_navigation_on_road_network_using_RTKLIB","321287318_Automatic_change_detection_in_lane-level_road_networks_using_GPS_trajectories","308751171_A_hybrid_HMM_model_for_travel_path_inference_with_sparse_GPS_samples","325294206_An_advanced_interactive-voting_based_map_matching_algorithm_for_low-sampling-rate_GPS_data","324545290_Accuracy_assessment_of_speed_values_calculated_from_GNSS_tracks_of_roads_obtained_from_VGI","323058695_Map_matching_approach_for_current_location_tracking_on_the_road_network","322052158_Map_Matching_for_Low-Sampling-Rate_GPS_Trajectories_by_Exploring_Real-time_Moving_Directions","314644142_Minimizing_Walking_Length_in_Map_Matching","313817354_Neighbor-Aided_Localization_in_Vehicular_Networks"]}
