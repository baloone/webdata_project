{"id":"317575037_Using_morphological_operators_and_inpainting_for_hair_removal_in_dermoscopic_images","abstract":"The increasing incidence of melanoma has led to development of computer-aided diagnosis systems that classify dermoscopic images. A fundamental problem however during the pre-processing stage is the removal of artifacts such as hair. Hair strands introduce additional edges, which can be problematic when performing automatic skin lesion segmentation. This paper proposes a straightforward approach to automatic hair and consequently noise removal. The process starts with a median filter on each color space of RGB, a bottom hat filter, a binary conversion, a dilation and morphological opening, and then the removal of small connected pixels. The detected hair regions are then filled up using harmonic inpainting. Experiments were carried out on the PHÂ² datasets and compared to DullRazor. We also generated synthetic hair on skin images and measured the reconstruction quality using peak signal-to-noise ratio.","authors":["Julie Ann Acebuque Salido","Conrado Ruiz"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3095140.3095142","Conference: the Computer Graphics International Conference"],"references":["257602103_PH2_-_A_dermoscopic_image_database_for_research_and_benchmarking","241416876_METRICS_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON_FOR_COLOR_IMAGE_DATABASE","237969729_Fast_and_accurate_border_detection_in_dermoscopy_images_using_statistical_region_merging_-_art_no_65123V","225507215_Gradient_Based_Image_Completion_by_Solving_Poisson_Equation","224846616_Distinguishing_Clinicopathologic_Features_of_Patients_with_V600E_and_V600K_BRAF-Mutant_Metastatic_Melanoma","224386928_Comparison_of_Segmentation_Methods_for_Melanoma_Diagnosis_in_Dermoscopy_Images","220099992_Automated_Melanoma_Recognition","26275629_Melanoma_in_Maori_Asian_and_Pacific_Peoples_in_New_Zealand","8119610_Vascular_Structures_in_Skin_Tumors","2404229_Image_Inpainting","292794675_Detection_of_skin_tumor_boundaried_in_color_images","265396296_An_Image_Analysis_System_for_Automated_Melanoma_Recognition","257759307_ELM_image_processing_for_melanocytic_skin_lesion_diagnosis_based_on_7-point_checklist_a_preliminary_discussion","234807037_Contrast_Limited_Adaptive_Histogram_Equalization","229352488_Hair_removal_methods_A_comparative_study_for_dermoscopy_images","224297810_A_reliable_skin_mole_localization_scheme","222669170_Active_Contours_without_Edges_for_Vector-Valued_Images","222522486_Nontexture_Inpainting_by_Curvature-Driven_Diffusions","222491421_Segmentation_of_skin_cancer_images","49831184_E-shaver_An_improved_DullRazor_R_for_digitally_removing_dark_and_light-colored_hairs_in_dermoscopic_images","45388548_Unsupervised_skin_lesions_border_detection_via_two-dimensional_image_analysis","23659843_The_Complexity_of_Diagnosing_Melanoma","19493937_In_vivo_epiluminescence_microscopy_of_pigmented_skin_lesions_I_Pattern_analysis_of_pigmented_skin_lesions","15041037_The_ABCD_rule_of_dermatoscopy_High_prospective_value_in_the_diagnosis_of_doubtful_melanocytic_skin_lesions","13792091_DullRazor_A_software_approach_to_hair_removal_from_images","11299827_Dermoscopy_Alternative_melanocytic_algorithms_-_The_ABCD_rule_of_dermatoscopy_Menzies_scoring_method_and_7-point_checklist","11152653_Automated_diagnosis_of_pigmented_skin_lesions","8141773_Early_Diagnosis_of_Cutaneous_Melanoma_Revisiting_the_ABCD_Criteria","5634197_Detection_of_skin_boundaries_in_color_images","3649864_Multi-stage_segmentation_method_for_images_of_skin_lesions","2920679_Fragment-Based_Image_Completion"]}
