A small amount of visual information needed effortlessly be processed, activates neural activity in occipital and parietal areas. Conversely, a visual task which requires sustained attention to process a large amount of sensory information, involves a set of long-distance connections between parietal and frontal areas coordinating the activity of these distant brain regions. We demonstrate that while neural interactions result in coherence, the strongest connection is achieved through coherence resonance induced by adjusting intrinsic brain noise.","authors":["Alexander N Pisarchik","Vladimir Maksimenko","Andrey Andreev","Nikita Frolov"],"meta":["December 2019Scientific Reports 9(1):18325","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-54577-1"],"references":["328251335_Perceptual_learning_of_fine_contrast_discrimination_changes_neuronal_tuning_and_population_coding_in_macaque_V4","326487525_Stochastic_resonance_enhances_the_rate_of_evidence_accumulation_during_combined_brain_stimulation_and_perceptual_decision-making","309294930_The_Dynamics_of_Functional_Brain_Networks_Integrated_Network_States_during_Cognitive_Task_Performance","335509060_Chimera_state_in_complex_networks_of_bistable_Hodgkin-Huxley_neurons","335097179_Low_rank_mechanisms_underlying_flexible_visual_representations","322179964_Coherence_resonance_in_stimulated_neuronal_network","321804736_Communication_dynamics_in_complex_brain_networks","320951244_Optogenetic_noise-photostimulation_on_the_brain_increases_somatosensory_spike_firing_responses","309708349_Theoretical_background_and_experimental_measurements_of_human_brain_noise_intensity_in_perception_of_ambiguous_images","305770993_Autapse-induced_multiple_coherence_resonance_in_single_neurons_and_neuronal_networks"]}
