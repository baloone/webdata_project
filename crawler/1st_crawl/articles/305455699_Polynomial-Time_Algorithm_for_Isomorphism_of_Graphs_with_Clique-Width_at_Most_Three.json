{"id":"305455699_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Isomorphism_of_Graphs_with_Clique-Width_at_Most_Three","abstract":"The clique-width is a measure of complexity of decomposing graphs into certain tree-like structures. The class of graphs with bounded clique-width contains bounded tree-width graphs. We give a polynomial time graph isomorphism algorithm for graphs with clique-width at most three. Our work is independent of the work by Grohe and Schweitzer [17] showing that the isomorphism problem for graphs of bounded clique-width is polynomial time.","authors":["Bireswar Das","Murali Krishna Enduri","Vinod Reddy"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-42634-1_5","Conference: International Computing and Combinatorics Conference","Project: Graph Isomorphism for Restricted Graph Classes"],"references":["287251089_Graph_Isomorphism_in_Quasipolynomial_Time","278663560_Logspace_and_FPT_Algorithms_for_Graph_Isomorphism_for_Subclasses_of_Bounded_Tree-Width_Graphs","277723723_Polynomial-time_Algorithm_for_Isomorphism_of_Graphs_with_Clique-width_at_most_3","268245143_Graph_decomposition_for_undirected_graphs","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","223332087_Does_co-NP_have_short_interactive_proofs","223067838_Handle-rewriting_hypergraph_grammars","220896737_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220533293_Clique-Width_is_NP-Complete","311556606_A_new_linear_algorithm_for_modular_decomposition","302502264_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Rank_Width","281353873_Polynomial_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_3_Graphs","276296047_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Rank_Width","265435167_A_Combinatorial_Decomposition_Theory","261369015_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Canonization_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","257050937_An_On2_Algorithm_for_Undirected_Split_Decomposition","239745342_A_combinatorial_decomposition_theory","230595904_Decomposition_of_Directed_Graphs","226376494_Transitiv_orientbare_Graphen","225502469_Polynomial_algorithms_for_graph_isomorphism_and_chromatic_index_on_partial_k-trees","225151584_Polynomial_Time_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_3_Graphs","222442364_Isomorphism_of_bounded_valence_can_be_tested_in_polynomial_time","222434550_Approximating_clique-width_and_branch-width","222398077_Testing_branch-width","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","222288243_Bodlaender_H_Polynomial_algorithm_for_graph_isomorphism_and_chromatic_index_on_partial_k-trees_Journal_of_Algorithms_114_631-643","221590555_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Genus","221218814_A_New_Linear_Algorithm_for_Modular_Decomposition","221150091_Moderately_Exponential_Bound_for_Graph_Isomorphism","220570000_Recent_developments_on_graphs_of_bounded_clique-width"]}
