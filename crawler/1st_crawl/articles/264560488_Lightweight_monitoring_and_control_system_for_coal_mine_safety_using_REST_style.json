{"id":"264560488_Lightweight_monitoring_and_control_system_for_coal_mine_safety_using_REST_style","abstract":"The complex environment of a coal mine requires the underground environment, devices and miners to be constantly monitored to ensure safe coal production. However, existing coal mines do not meet these coverage requirements because blind spots occur when using a wired network. In this paper, we develop a Web-based, lightweight remote monitoring and control platform using a wireless sensor network (WSN) with the REST style to collect temperature, humidity and methane concentration data in a coal mine using sensor nodes. This platform also collects information on personnel positions inside the mine. We implement a RESTful application programming interface (API) that provides access to underground sensors and instruments through the Web such that underground coal mine physical devices can be easily interfaced to remote monitoring and control applications. We also implement three different scenarios for Web-based, lightweight remote monitoring and control of coal mine safety and measure and analyze the system performance. Finally, we present the conclusions from this study and discuss future work.","authors":["Bo Cheng","Xin Cheng","Chen Junliang"],"meta":["August 2014ISA Transactions 54","DOI:10.1016/j.isatra.2014.07.004"],"references":["260508373_Towards_the_Implementation_of_IoT_for_Environmental_Condition_Monitoring_in_Homes","228901532_Introducing_Collaborative_Service_Mashup_Design","224298105_The_Design_and_Evaluation_of_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network_for_Mine_Safety_Monitoring","224241011_A_Mobile_Gateway_for_Remote_Interaction_With_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224208795_A_resource_oriented_architecture_for_the_Web_of_Things","220595063_Interacting_with_the_SOA-Based_Internet_of_Things_Discovery_Query_Selection_and_On-Demand_Provisioning_of_Web_Services","3420115_An_Online_Platform_for_Web_APIs_and_Service_Mashups","3420100_Composing_RESTful_Services_and_Collaborative_Workflows_A_Lightweight_Approach","232529609_Centralized_and_distributed_control_architectures_under_Foundation_Fieldbus_network","224703577_Web_Services-Based_Architecture_for_the_Interactions_between_End-User_Applications_and_Sink-Less_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224599442_A_Reliable_and_High-Bandwidth_Multihop_Wireless_Sensor_Network_for_Mine_Tunnel_Monitoring","224037259_Improved_correlation_analysis_and_visualization_of_industrial_alarm_data","221807449_Design_and_implementation_of_an_Internet_based_effective_controlling_and_monitoring_system_with_wireless_fieldbus_communications_technologies_for_process_automation-An_experimental_study","221587537_A_Conceptual_Modeling_Approach_to_Business_Service_Mashup_Development","221194960_Fixed-Mobile_Hybrid_Mashups_Applying_the_REST_Principles_to_Mobile-Specific_Resources","220443065_Underground_Coal_Mine_Monitoring_with_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","51617054_Development_of_an_automatic_subsea_blowout_preventer_stack_control_system_using_PLC_based_SCADA","5496313_Development_of_an_integrated_wireless_sensor_network_micro-environmental_monitoring_system","3419988_SA-REST_Semantically_Interoperable_and_Easier-to-Use_Services_and_Mashups"]}
