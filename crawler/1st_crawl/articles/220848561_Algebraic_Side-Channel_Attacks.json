{"id":"220848561_Algebraic_Side-Channel_Attacks","abstract":"In 2002, algebraic attacks using overdened systems of equa- tions have been proposed as a potentially very powerful cryptanalysis technique against block ciphers. However, although a number of convinc- ing experiments have been performed against certain reduced algorithms, it is not clear wether these attacks can be successfully applied in general and to a large class of ciphers. In this paper, we show that algebraic techniques can be combined,with side-channel attacks in a very eec- tive and natural fashion. As an illustration, we apply them to the block cipher PRESENT that is a stimulating rst target, due to its simple algebraic structure. The proposed attacks have a number,of interest- ing features: (1) they exploit the information leakages of all the cipher rounds, (2) in common implementation contexts (e.g. assuming a Ham- ming weight leakage model), they recover the block cipher keys after the observation of a single encryption, (3) these attacks can succeed in an unknown-plaintext/ciphertext adversarial scenario and (4) they directly defeat countermeasures such as boolean masking. Eventually, we argue that algebraic side-channel attacks can take advantage of any kind of physical leakage, leading to a new tradeo between the robustness and informativeness of the side-channel information extraction.","authors":["Mathieu Renauld","Fran√ßois-Xavier Standaert"],"meta":["December 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-16342-5_29","SourceDBLP","Conference: Information Security and Cryptology - 5th International Conference, Inscrypt 2009, Beijing, China, December 12-15, 2009.
