{"id":"342406413_Image-Processing-Based_Low-Cost_Fault_Detection_Solution_for_End-of-Line_ECUs_in_Automotive_Manufacturing","abstract":"The manufacturing industry is continuously researching and developing strategies and solutions to increase product quality and to decrease production time and costs. The approach is always targeting more automated, traceable, and supervised production, minimizing the impact of the human factor. In the automotive industry, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) manufacturing ends with complex testing, the End-of-Line (EoL) products being afterwards sent to client companies. This paper proposes an image-processing-based low-cost fault detection (IP-LC-FD) solution for the EoL ECUs, aiming for high-quality and fast detection. The IP-LC-FD solution approaches the problem of determining, on the manufacturing line, the correct mounting of the pins in the locations of each connector of the ECU module, respectively, other defects as missing or extra pins, damaged clips, or surface cracks. The IP-LC-FD system is a hardwareâ€“software structure, based on Raspberry Pi microcomputers, Pi cameras, respectively, Python and OpenCV environments. This paper presents the two main stages of the research, the experimental model, and the prototype. The rapid integration into the production line represented an important goal, meaning the accomplishment of the specific hard acceptance requirements regarding both performance and functionality. The solution was implemented and tested as an experimental model and prototype in a real industrial environment, proving excellent results.","authors":["Adrian Korodi","Denis Anitei","Alexandru Boitor","Ioan Silea"],"meta":["June 2020Sensors 20(12):3520","DOI:10.3390/s20123520"],"references":["341309335_Defect_Detection_on_Rolling_Element_Surface_Scans_Using_Neural_Image_Segmentation","340458788_Calibration_and_Image_Reconstruction_in_a_Spot_Scanning_Detection_System_for_Surface_Defects","339298232_A_Deep-Learning-based_3D_Defect_Quantitative_Inspection_System_in_CC_Products_Surface","338959381_A_High-Performance_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_the_Automated_Optical_Inspection_of_Laser_Welding","335830731_Deep_Learning_for_Industrial_Computer_Vision_Quality_Control_in_the_Printing_Industry_40","332628238_Optical_Inspection_System_for_Gear_Tooth_Surfaces_Using_a_Projection_Moire_Method","332075734_SMD_Classification_for_Automated_Optical_Inspection_Machine_Using_Convolution_Neural_Network","326962381_Implementation_of_an_Automatic_Optical_Inspection_System_for_Solder_Quality_Classification_of_THT_Solder_Joints","317693559_Target_Image_Matching_Algorithm_based_on_Pyramid_Model_and_Higher_Moments","316589656_A_three-dimensional_triangular_vision-based_contouring_error_detection_system_and_method_for_machine_tools","301832464_Realization_of_CUDA-based_real-time_registration_and_target_localization_for_high-resolution_video_images","315914991_Development_of_SBC_based_machine-vision_system_for_PCB_board_assembly_Automatic_Optical_Inspection","309029338_Automatic_visual_inspection_An_approach_with_multi-instance_learning","301274691_A_study_on_using_image_serving_technology_for_high_precision_mechanical_positioning","268692029_Automated_visual_inspection_in_the_semiconductor_industry_A_survey"]}
