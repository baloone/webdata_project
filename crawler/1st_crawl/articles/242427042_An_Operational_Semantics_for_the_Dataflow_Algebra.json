{"id":"242427042_An_Operational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"This report defines an operational semantics for the event layer of the dataflow algebra, to complement the denotational semantics that has already been defined for it. The report defines a transition system and derivation sequences for this semantics, and then normal forms for these derivation sequences, which allow semantic functions to be defined directly for constructions in the algebra. The correctness of this operational semantics is then demonstrated, by proving the soundness and completeness of the axioms of the algebra with respect to it.","authors":["A. J.
