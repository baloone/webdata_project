{"id":"282000447_Subgraph-Based_Filterbanks_for_Graph_Signals","abstract":"We design a critically-sampled orthogonal transform for graph signals, via\ngraph filterbanks. Instead of partitioning the nodes in two sets so as to\nremove one every two nodes in the filterbank downsampling operations, the\ndesign is based on a partition of the graph in connected subgraphs. Coarsening\nis then achieved by defining one \"supernode\" for each subgraph: the edges for\nthis coarsened graph derives hence from connectivity between the subgraphs.\nUnlike the one every two nodes downsampling operation on bipartite graphs, this\ncoarsening operation does not have an exact formulation in the Fourier space of\nthe graph. Instead, we rely on the local Fourier bases of each subgraph to\ndefine filtering operations. We apply successfully this method to decompose\ngraph signals, and show promising performance on compression and denoising\nexperiments.","authors":["Nicolas Tremblay","Pierre Borgnat"],"meta":["September 2015IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 64(15)","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2016.2544747","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282402877_Efficient_Sampling_Set_Selection_for_Bandlimited_Graph_Signals_Using_Graph_Spectral_Proxies","273788318_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Sampling_Theory","273396704_Downsampling_of_Signals_on_Graphs_Via_Maximum_Spanning_Trees","266971982_Local-Set-Based_Graph_Signal_Reconstruction","260637730_Perfect_Reconstruction_Two-Channel_Wavelet_Filter_Banks_for_Graph_Structured_Data","258794052_Tight_Wavelet_Frames_on_Multislice_Graphs","258247733_Spectrum-Adapted_Tight_Graph_Wavelet_and_Vertex-Frequency_Frames","242479489_Kumar_V_A_Fast_and_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_for_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs_SIAM_Journal_on_Scientific_Computing_201_359-392","232743728_The_Emerging_Field_of_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Extending_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis_to_Networks_and_Other_Irregular_Domains","232735582_Compact_Support_Biorthogonal_Wavelet_Filterbanks_for_ArbitraryUndirected_Graphs","232272943_Discrete_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs","226273429_The_Haar_Wavelet_Transform_of_a_Dendrogram","221344948_Multiscale_Wavelets_on_Trees_Graphs_and_High_Dimensional_Data_Theory_and_Applications_to_Semi_Supervised_Learning","51052756_Multilevel_Compression_of_Random_Walks_on_Networks_Reveals_Hierarchical_Organization_in_Large_Integrated_Systems","2797268_A_Fast_And_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_For_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs","1913681_Fast_Unfolding_of_Communities_in_Large_Networks","1899995_Nodal_domains_on_graphs_-_How_to_count_them_and_why","1897109_Treelets--An_adaptive_multi-scale_basis_for_sparse_unordered_data","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","300470061_Applied_and_computational_harmonic_analysis_on_graphs_and_networks","300413884_Joint_filtering_of_graph_and_graph-signals","299671386_Spectral_Graph_Theory","288179601_A_Multiscale_Pyramid_Transform_for_Graph_Signals","287249580_Signal_Recovery_on_Graphs_Fundamental_Limits_of_Sampling_Strategies","284096844_Random_Sampling_of_Bandlimited_Signals_on_Graphs","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","273393152_Oversampled_Graph_Laplacian_Matrix_for_Graph_Filter_Banks","271554622_Critically-sampled_perfect-reconstruction_spline-wavelet_filterbanks_for_graph_signals","270653936_Canonical_cerebellar_graph_wavelets_and_their_application_to_FMRI_activation_mapping","267108044_Graph_Coloring_Using_Eigenvalue_Decomposition","265388845_Graph_Wavelets_for_Multiscale_Community_Mining","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","264828551_Big_Data_Analysis_with_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Representation_and_processing_of_massive_data_sets_with_irregular_structure","261462414_Graph-wavelet_filterbanks_for_edge-aware_image_processing","261198375_Discrete_signal_processing_on_graphs_Graph_fourier_transform","261091137_Gap-filling_by_the_empirical_mode_decomposition","259074126_Wavelets_from_Filter_Banks","258774964_A_windowed_graph_Fourier_transform","250918096_Vertex-Frequency_Analysis_on_Graphs","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","233407299_Spectral_Graph_Theory","222426126_Diffusion_wavelets","222404885_Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Spectral_Graph_Theory","220692403_Wavelets_and_Filter_Banks","48208209_Kron_Reduction_of_Graphs_With_Applications_to_Electrical_Networks","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","2638441_Coarsening_Sampling_And_Smoothing_Elements_Of_The_Multilevel_Method"]}
