{"id":"308960473_Computation_of_Hermite_interpolation_in_terms_of_B-spline_basis_using_polar_forms","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to present an Hermite interpolation problem with B-splines of high degree of smoothness. More precisely, we use polar forms to find the B-spline control points for Hermite interpolation. The resulting formula is used to give Hermite basis functions. In particular, Quadratic and cubic interpolations with sharp parameters are analyzed.","authors":["Abdellah Lamnii","Mohamed Lamnii","Fatima Oumellal"],"meta":["October 2016Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 134","DOI:10.1016/j.matcom.2016.09.009","Project: Interpolation and Approximation"],"references":["286914986_A_Practical_Duide_of_Splines","273401801_Construction_of_univariate_spline_quasi-interpolants_with_symmetric_functions","260576806_Monotone_and_Convex_Spline_Interpolation","256209311_On_Calculating_with_B-Splines","251373450_On_Shape_Preserving_C_2_Hermite_Interpolation","243095679_On_Shape_Preserving_Quadratic_Spline_Interpolation","233845317_Monotone_Piecewise_Cubic_Interpolation","226040389_Compactly_supported_fundamental_functions_for_spline_interpolation","222621444_Cardinal_interpolation_and_spline_fucntions_V_The_B-splines_for_cardinal_Hermite_interpolation","222461530_Blossoms_are_polar_forms","220583510_Computing_B-spline_control_points_using_polar_forms","220424670_Scalar-_and_Planar-_Valued_Curve_Fitting_Using_Splines_Under_Tension","220221487_On_Hermite_interpolation_with_B-splines","220221190_Hermite_interpolation_with_B-splines","220221176_General_b-spline_hermite_interpolation","2295850_Polar_Forms_for_Geometrically_Continuous_Spline_Curves_of_Arbitrary_Degree"]}
