{"id":"327552094_Comparison_of_Code_Measures_of_IEC_61131-3_and_61499_Standards_for_Typical_Automation_Applications","abstract":"The IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 standards are currently used to implement automation systems. Although aspects as reuseability, execution models, and component-based design have been discussed and analyzed for both standards, the programming effort and complexity of implementation for typical tasks in industrial automation have not been compared so far. This work proposes two typical application classes of industrial automation systems and implements one concrete application for each class with IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499, respectively. Both implementations are then evaluated via McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead software measures, providing an objective comparison on the implementations.","authors":["Peter Gsellmann","Martin Melik-Merkumians","Georg Schitter"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502464","Conference: IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory AutomationAt: Turin, Italy","Projects: Automation and Control for Modular Robotics and Production SystemsEclipse 4diac"],"references":["271853701_The_Future_of_Industrial_Automation_and_IEC_614993_Standard","256419417_IEC_61499_Back_to_the_well_proven_practice_of_IEC_61131","245347775_Different_perspectives_Face_to_face_IEC_61499_architecture_for_distributed_automation_The_glass_half_full_view","322561001_Metrics_for_software_quality_in_automated_production_systems_as_an_indicator_for_technical_debt","308836290_Towards_software_metrics_for_evaluating_quality_of_IEC_61499_automation_software","291002387_IEC_61131-3_Programming_industrial_automation_systems_Concepts_and_programming_languages_requirements_for_programming_systems_decision-making_aids","267097212_Complexity_in_engineering_design_and_manufacturing","256673855_Complexity_in_engineering_design_and_manufacturing","235978157_Elements_Of_Software_Science","232617908_The_Research_on_Software_Metrics_and_Software_Complexity_Metrics","224089609_IEC_61499_Function_Block_Model_Facts_and_Fallacies","220854812_Comparing_software_metrics_tools","223527517_Asynchronous_and_synchronous_approahces_for_programming_distributed_control_systems_based_on_standards","3189025_A_Complexity_Measure"]}
