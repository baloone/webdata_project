{"id":"310824798_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System","abstract":"Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.","authors":["Tianqi Chen","Carlos Guestrin"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1145/2939672.2939785","Conference: the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["228936665_From_ranknet_to_lambdarank_to_lambdamart_An_overview","228776646_Additive_Logistic_Regression_A_Statistical_View_of_Boosting","222573328_Stochastic_Gradient_Boosting","221619438_McRank_Learning_to_Rank_Using_Multiple_Classification_and_Gradient_Boosting","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","210342018_Parallel_Boosted_Regression_Trees_for_Web_Search_Ranking","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","2888930_Importance_Sampled_Learning_Ensembles","2854033_Space-Efficient_Online_Computation_of_Quantile_Summaries","280687718_Greedy_Function_Approximation_A_Gradient_Boosting_Machine","277334549_MLlib_Machine_Learning_in_Apache_Spark","266661681_Practical_Lessons_from_Predicting_Clicks_on_Ads_at_Facebook","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","255986532_Learning_Nonlinear_Functions_Using_Regularized_Greedy_Forest","254004381_Scaling_up_machine_learning_Parallel_and_distributed_approaches","223460275_The_Netflix_Prize","221613446_Stochastic_gradient_boosted_distributed_decision_trees","221405035_Robust_LogitBoost_and_Adaptive_Base_Class_ABC_LogitBoost","220538314_PLANET_Massively_parallel_learning_of_tree_ensembles_with_MapReduce","220320140_Yahoo_Learning_to_Rank_Challenge_Overview","215990688_Generalized_Boosted_Models_A_Guide_to_the_GBM_Package","4263220_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Approximate_Quantiles_in_High_Speed_Data_Streams","2424824_Greedy_Function_Approximation_A_Gradient_Boosting_Machine"]}
