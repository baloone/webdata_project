{"id":"308874594_Evaluation_of_the_efficiency_of_the_chi-square_metric","abstract":"The efficiency of using the chi-square metrics to weigh terms used in text documents is evaluated. The procedure includes the selection and advanced processing of class C and ~C texts, compilation of a reference dictionary and calculation of scores for all the terms in the dictionary, calculation of χ2 coefficients for terms from a class C text, and calculation of the general efficiency factor by the sum of the coefficients found for the terms from the reference dictionary. The weighting by the χ2 formula, odds-ratio (OR) formula, and on the basis of probabilistic variables is analyzed and compared. It was found that the best result is yielded by the OR-based weighting.\nTo get full text go to http://yatsko.zohosites.com/academic-works.html","authors":["Viatcheslav A.
