{"id":"243032235_Hadamard_designs","abstract":"In this paper it is shown that an Hadamard design with each letter repeated once and only once can exist for 2, 4 and 8 letters only.\nL.D. Baumert and Marshall Hall, Jr have found a design with four letters each repeated three times. Their design and the design on four letters each repeated once, found by J. Williamson, is the totality previously published.","authors":["Jennifer Wallis"],"meta":["February 1970Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 2(01)","DOI:10.1017/S0004972700041599"],"references":["243034052_y_k_l_Configurations_And_Hadamard_Matrices","239285366_A_new_construction_for_Hadamard_matrices","38335898_Hadamard's_determinant_theorem_and_the_sum_of_four_squares"]}
