A corpus of research articles in computer science was constructed, comprised of 10,450,035 running words from 1045 research articles across ten sub-disciplines of computer science. The technical word List for research articles in computer science was created by the methods of computer-based analysis and the rating scales. 769 technical word types were identified and listed in Appendix A.
