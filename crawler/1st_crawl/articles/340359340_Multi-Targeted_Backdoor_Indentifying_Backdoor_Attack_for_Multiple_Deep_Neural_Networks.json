{"id":"340359340_Multi-Targeted_Backdoor_Indentifying_Backdoor_Attack_for_Multiple_Deep_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We propose a multi-targeted backdoor that misleads different models to different classes. The method trains multiple models with data that include specific triggers that will be misclassified by different models into different classes. For example, an attacker can use a single multi-targeted backdoor sample to make model A recognize it as a stop sign, model B as a left-turn sign, model C as a right-turn sign, and model D as a U-turn sign. We used MNIST and Fashion-MNIST as experimental datasets and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the proposed method with a trigger can cause misclassification as different classes by different models with a 100% attack success rate on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST while maintaining the 97.18% and 91.1% accuracy, respectively, on data without a trigger.","authors":["Hyun Kwon","Hyunsoo Yoon","Ki-Woong Park"],"meta":["April 2020IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems E103.D(4):883-887","DOI:10.1587/transinf.2019EDL8170"],"references":["319312259_Fashion-MNIST_a_Novel_Image_Dataset_for_Benchmarking_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","319235406_BadNets_Identifying_Vulnerabilities_in_the_Machine_Learning_Model_Supply_Chain","303657108_TensorFlow_A_system_for_large-scale_machine_learning","259440613_Intriguing_properties_of_neural_networks","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","323249035_Trojaning_Attack_on_Neural_Networks","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","228095591_Poisoning_Attacks_against_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
