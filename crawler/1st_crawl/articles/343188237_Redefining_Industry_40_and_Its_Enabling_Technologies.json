{"id":"343188237_Redefining_Industry_40_and_Its_Enabling_Technologies","abstract":"Industry 4.0 can be seen as the most buzzword that mentioned almost in every subject. Admitted as the new industrial revolution, research related to Industry 4.0 has gained excessive attention from academia, government, and industries. However, a formal academic definition of Industry 4.0 that reflected the current advancement could not be found. The technologies that driven this new revolution also bias. Furthermore, the subject area that greatly contributed to the vision of Industry 4.0 also unknown. This research investigated publications in diverse literature databases to find the answers of those gaps. Based on that, we proposed a comprehensive definition of Industry 4.0 and determined 12 enabling technologies that driven Industry 4.0. In addition, we found manufacturing and computer science as the most contributed research subject.","authors":["Khamdi Mubarok"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1569(3):032025","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1569/3/032025"],"references":["319869218_Narrow_Band_Internet_of_Things","316787559_Fog_of_Everything_Energy-Efficient_Networked_Computing_Architectures_Research_Challenges_and_a_Case_Study","312928958_The_Vision_of_Industrie_40_in_the_Making-a_Case_of_Future_Told_Tamed_and_Traded","310823803_A_Review_of_Technology_Standards_and_Patent_Portfolios_for_Enabling_Cyber-Physical_Systems_in_Advanced_Manufacturing","302919495_Software-Defined_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_in_the_Context_of_Industry_40","316179453_Industry_40_A_Survey_on_Technologies_Applications_and_Open_Research_Issues","315487360_The_Future_of_Industrial_Communication_Automation_Networks_in_the_Era_of_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Industry_40","308604575_Decentralizing_Privacy_Using_Blockchain_to_Protect_Personal_Data","304293566_Industry_40_Towards_future_industrial_opportunities_and_challenges","300409325_Design_Principles_for_Industrie_40_Scenarios"]}
