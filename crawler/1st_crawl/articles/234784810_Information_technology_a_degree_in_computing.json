{"id":"234784810_Information_technology_a_degree_in_computing","abstract":"Three years ago, our department developed a new computing degree, a degree in Information Technology conceptually distinct from the standard Computer Science, Information Systems or Computer Engineering degrees. The focus of this degree is on current computing technology, its implementation and application. This paper presents a description of our program, the motivation and justification for its development, the curriculum design goals, current curriculum implementation, problems yet to be resolved and future plans.","authors":["William J.
