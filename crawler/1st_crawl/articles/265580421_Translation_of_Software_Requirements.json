{"id":"265580421_Translation_of_Software_Requirements","abstract":"Stakeholders typically speak and express software requirements in their native languages. On the other hand, software engineers typically express software requirements in English to programmers who program using English-like programming languages. Translation of software requirements between the native languages of the stakeholders and English introduces further ambiguities. This calls for a system that simplifies translation of software requirements while minimizing ambiguities. Unfortunately, this problem has been overlooked in the literature. This paper introduces a system designed to facilitate translation of requirements between English and Arabic. The system can also facilitate the analysis of software requirements written in Arabic. This is achieved through enforcing writing software requirements statements using templates. Templates are selected such that they enforce following best practices in writing requirements documents.","authors":["Hanan Elazhary"],"meta":["December 2011","Project: Ambiguities in Software Requirements Documents"],"references":["220796409_Automated_review_of_natural_language_requirements_documents_Generating_useful_warnings_with_user-extensible_glossaries_driving_a_simple_state_machine","4292877_Automatic_Quality_Assessment_of_SRS_Text_by_Means_of_a_Decision-Tree-Based_Text_Classifier","3187970_Managing_Conflicts_in_Goal-Driven_Requirements_Engineering","249886816_QuARS_A_Tool_for_Analyzing_Requirements","234802458_Software_Requirements","234774872_Classical_and_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_W_Uml_and_C","221029633_Software_Requirements_Specification_Database_Based_on_Requirements_Frame_Model","221013917_Guiding_Scenario_Authoring","4043785_Higher_quality_requirements_specifications_through_natural_language_patterns","3247780_Requirements_and_psychology"]}
