{"id":"330587714_Deep_Feature_Ranking_for_Person_Re-Identification","abstract":"Person re-identification plays critical part in many surveillance applications. Due to complicated illumination environments and various viewpoints, it is still a challenging problem to extract robust features. To solve this issue, we propose a novel deep feature ranking scheme. Our main contribution is to rank achieved deep features, which are obtained by classic deep learning model, and set the sort order number as our feature vector, named as Ordinal Deep Features (ODFs). Person re-identification results are acquired by ranking person candidates by measuring distance based on ODFs. Since applying rank orders rather than original feature values, our method achieves robust results, especially under the situation of viewpoints shift. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate the significance of the proposed feature. Meanwhile, comparative experiments are applied over publicly available dataset, our method achieves promising performance and outperforms state of the art methods. Moreover, we applied the proposed feature in scenario of image classification and discussed the effectiveness.","authors":["Jie Nie","Lei Huang","Wenfeng Zhang","Guanqun Wei"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894347"],"references":["322060624_Unlabeled_Samples_Generated_by_GAN_Improve_the_Person_Re-identification_Baseline_in_Vitro","318120143_Pedestrian_Alignment_Network_for_Large-scale_Person_Re-Identification","315807887_Beyond_Triplet_Loss_A_Deep_Quadruplet_Network_for_Person_Re-identification","315489606_Improving_Person_Re-identification_by_Attribute_and_Identity_Learning","308278517_A_Deep_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Progressive_Vehicle_Re-identification_for_Urban_Surveillance","307896023_Performance_Measures_and_a_Data_Set_for_Multi-Target_Multi-Camera_Tracking","281118262_Person_Re-Identification_by_Video_Ranking","278655867_Salient_Color_Names_for_Person_Re-identification","272195488_Person_Re-identification_Meets_Image_Search","264923968_Mahalanobis_Distance_Learning_for_Person_Re-identification","262402148_Person_Re-identification_by_Salience_Matching","261276850_Unsupervised_Salience_Learning_for_Person_Re-identification","221364063_SIFT-Rank_Ordinal_description_for_invariant_feature_correspondence","221362595_Person_re-identification_by_probabilistic_relative_distance_comparison","221259651_Person_Re-Identification_by_Support_Vector_Ranking","328180373_Fusion_of_Multiple_Person_Re-id_Methods_With_Model_and_Data-Aware_Abilities","327270131_Dual-Stream_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Video_Captioning","320971287_Re-ranking_Person_Re-identification_with_k-Reciprocal_Encoding","320971101_Spindle_Net_Person_Re-identification_with_Human_Body_Region_Guided_Feature_Decomposition_and_Fusion","320968559_Joint_Detection_and_Identification_Feature_Learning_for_Person_Search","320723945_Two-Stream_Multi-Rate_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Video-Based_Pedestrian_Re-Identification","319770530_Non-parametric_local_transforms_for_computing_visual_correspondence","317612419_Joint_Attributes_and_Event_Analysis_for_Multimedia_Event_Detection","317203596_Feature_Interaction_Augmented_Sparse_Learning_for_Fast_Kinect_Motion_Detection","313499199_Person_re-identification_by_attributes","311753592_Unsupervised_person_re-identification_with_locality-constrained_Earth_Mover's_distance","311610684_Person_Re-identification_by_Multi-Channel_Parts-Based_CNN_with_Improved_Triplet_Loss_Function","311610669_Joint_Learning_of_Single-Image_and_Cross-Image_Representations_for_Person_Re-identification","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308820677_Learning_to_rank_in_person_re-identification_with_metric_ensembles","308384735_Robust_Color_Invariant_Model_for_Person_Re-Identification","307516488_Person_re-identification_using_sparse_representation_with_manifold_constraints","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","304577866_Unified_Discriminating_Feature_Analysis_for_Visual_Category_Recognition","300254342_Multiple_Scaled_Person_Re-Identification_Framework_for_HD_Video_Surveillance_Application","299487227_Multi-task_deep_visual-semantic_embedding_for_video_thumbnail_selection","296685781_Hierarchical_Clustering_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Joint_Human_Action_Grouping_and_Recognition","296373109_Person_re-identification_by_Local_Maximal_Occurrence_representation_and_metric_learning","284241057_Person_Re-identification_by_Attribute-Assisted_Clothes_Appearance","279738030_Person_Re-Identification_by_Iterative_Re-Weighted_Sparse_Ranking","265767278_Discriminative_Image_Descriptors_for_Person_Re-identification","262412600_Human_Reidentification_with_Transferred_Metric_Learning","260358831_Ordinal_measures_for_image_correspondence","259507456_On-the-fly_feature_importance_mining_for_person_re-identification","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation","225209155_Non-parametric_local_transforms_for_computing_visual_correspondence","221620589_Learning_Visual_Attributes","221363206_A_Discriminatively_Trained_Multiscale_Deformable_Part_Model","3193433_Normalized_Kemeny_and_Snell_distance_a_novel_metric_for_quantitative_evaluation_of_rank-order_similarity_of_images"]}
