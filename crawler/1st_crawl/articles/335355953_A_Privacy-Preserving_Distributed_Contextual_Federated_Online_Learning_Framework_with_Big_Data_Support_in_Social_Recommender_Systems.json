{"id":"335355953_A_Privacy-Preserving_Distributed_Contextual_Federated_Online_Learning_Framework_with_Big_Data_Support_in_Social_Recommender_Systems","abstract":"Nowadays, the booming demand of big data analytics and the constraints of computational ability and network bandwidth have made it difficult for a stand-alone agent/service provider to provide suitable information for every user from the large volume online data within the limited time. To handle this challenge, a recommender system (RS) can call in a group of agents to collaborate to learn users’ preference and taste, which is known as a distributed recommender system (DRS). DRSs can improve the accuracy of a traditional RS by requesting agents to share information with each other. However, it is challenging for DRSs to make personalized recommendations for each user due to the large amount of candidates. In addition, information sharing among agents raises a privacy concern. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving DRS in this paper, and then model each service provider as a distributed online learner with context-awareness. Service providers collaborate to make personalized recommendations by learning users’ preferences according to the user context and users’ history behaviors. We adopt the \nfederated learning \nframework to help train a high quality privacy- preserving centralized model over a large number of distributed agents which is probably unreliable with relatively slow network connections. To handle big data scenario, we build an item-cluster tree to deal with online and increasing datasets \nfrom top to the bottom \n. We further consider the structure of social network and present an efficient algorithm to avoid more performance loss adaptively. Theoretical proofs show that our proposed algorithm can achieve sublinear regret and differential privacy protection simultaneously for service providers and users. Numerical results confirm that our novel framework can handle increasing big datasets and strike a trade-off between privacy-preserving level and the prediction accuracy.","authors":["Pan Zhou","Kehao Wang","Linke Guo","Shimin Gong"],"meta":["August 2019IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2019.2936565"],"references":["325420687_Privacy-Preserving_Social_Media_Data_Publishing_for_Personalized_Ranking-Based_Recommendation","322559912_Differentially_Private_Distributed_Online_Learning","312485550_A_Survey_of_Collaborative_Filtering_Algorithms_for_Social_Recommender_Systems","289263752_Context-aware_collaborative_topic_regression_with_social_matrix_factorization_for_recommender_systems","282686173_Big_Data_Analysis_Recommendation_System_with_Hadoop_Framework","281076678_Stochastic_Simultaneous_Optimistic_Optimization","279050158_A_Privacy-Preserving_Framework_for_Personalized_Social_Recommendations","276248376_Beyond_the_hype_Big_data_concepts_methods_and_analytics","235218437_Generating_Private_Recommendations_Efficiently_Using_Homomorphic_Encryption_and_Data_Packing","226098747_Content-based_Recommender_Systems_State_of_the_Art_and_Trends","225124717_Calibrating_Noise_to_Sensitivity_in_Private_Data_Analysis","221311488_On_k-Anonymity_and_the_Curse_of_Dimensionality","221112399_Bandit_Based_Monte-Carlo_Planning","220690817_Prediction_Learning_and_Games","220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","220320918_Contextual_Multi-Armed_Bandits","45903533_A_Contextual-Bandit_Approach_to_Personalized_News_Article_Recommendation","2207147_Multi-Armed_Bandits_in_Metric_Spaces","330695411_Federated_Machine_Learning_Concept_and_Applications","324118515_A_General_Framework_for_Implicit_and_Explicit_Social_Recommendation","324023800_Privacy-Preserving_Collaborative_Model_Learning_The_Case_of_Word_Vector_Training","322260973_Scalable_Content-Aware_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Location_Recommendation","319606972_Mobile_Edge_Computing_A_Survey","318329140_An_Approach_for_Building_Efficient_and_Accurate_Social_Recommender_Systems_Using_Individual_Relationship_Networks","317403843_EU_General_Data_Protection_Regulation_Changes_and_implications_for_personal_data_collecting_companies","309283497_Federated_Learning_Strategies_for_Improving_Communication_Efficiency","308355497_Trustsvd_Collaborative_filtering_with_both_the_explicit_and_implicit_influence_of_user_trust_and_of_item_ratings","308061191_The_Algorithmic_Foundations_of_Differential_Privacy","302558252_A_survey_of_recommendation_system_Research_challenges","276337800_Online_Learning_in_Large-Scale_Contextual_Recommender_Systems","271549787_Multi-armed_bandits_in_the_presence_of_side_observations_in_social_networks","266655234_Beyond_personalization_and_anonymity_Towards_a_group-based_recommender_system","265973077_Robust_De-anonymization_of_Large_Datasets_How_to_Break_Anonymity_of_the_Netflix_Prize_Dataset","263029739_Online_Stochastic_Optimization_under_Correlated_Bandit_Feedback","262167327_A_distributed_recommender_system_architecture","260580607_From_Technological_Networks_to_Social_Networks","256721259_An_effective_recommendation_method_for_cold_start_new_users_using_trust_and_distrust_networks","256035043_Big_Data_for_All_Privacy_and_User_Control_in_the_Age_of_Analytics","244989895_Distributed_Online_Big_Data_Classification_Using_Context_Information","227007340_Context-Aware_Recommender_Systems","221653721_The_cost_of_privacy_Destruction_of_data-mining_utility_in_anonymized_data_publishing","221591672_Differential_privacy_under_continual_observation","221141035_A_matrix_factorization_technique_with_trust_propagation_for_recommendation_in_social_networks","220897338_Private_and_Continual_Release_of_Statistics","220613483_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_Systems","220515485_Incorporating_contextual_information_in_recommender_systems_using_a_multidimensional_approach","45863732_Contextual_Bandits_with_Similarity_Information","4294387_Mechanism_Design_via_Differential_Privacy"]}
