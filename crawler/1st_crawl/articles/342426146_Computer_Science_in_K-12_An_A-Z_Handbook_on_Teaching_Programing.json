{"id":"342426146_Computer_Science_in_K-12_An_A-Z_Handbook_on_Teaching_Programing","abstract":"Coding teaches our students the essence of logical thinking and problem solving while also preparing them for a world in which computing is becoming increasingly pervasive. While there’s excitement and enthusiasm about programming becoming an intrinsic part of K-12 curricula the world over, there’s also growing a crucial need to prepare teachers to teach effectively at all grade levels.\n\nThis book is an enduring, practical guide for every K-12 CS teacher anywhere who is either teaching or planning to teach programming at any grade level. To this end, readers will discover:\n❖ An A-to-Z organization that affords comprehensive insight into teaching introductory programming.\n❖ 26 chapters that cover foundational concepts, practices and well-researched pedagogies related to teaching introductory programming as an integral part of K–12 computer science. Cumulatively these chapters address the two salient building blocks of effective teaching of introductory programming—what content to teach (concepts and practices) and how to teach (pedagogy).\n❖ Concrete ideas and rich grade-appropriate examples inspired by practice and research for classroom use.\n❖ Perspectives and experiences shared by educators and scholars who are actively practicing and/or examiningthe teaching of computer science and programming in K-12 classrooms.","authors":["Shuchi Grover"],"meta":["June 2020","Publisher: EdfinityISBN: 9781734662702","Project: Introductory Programming"],"references":[]}
