{"id":"238799612_A_Formal_Basis_for_the_Heuristic_Determination_of_Minimum_Cost_Paths","abstract":"Our paper on the use of heuristic information in graph searching defined a path-finding algorithm, A*, and proved that it had two important properties. In the notation of the paper, we proved that if the heuristic function Ã± (n) is a lower bound on the true minimal cost from node n to a goal node, then A* is admissible; i.e., it would find a minimal cost path if any path to a goal node existed. Further, we proved that if the heuristic function also satisfied something called the consistency assumption, then A* was optimal; i.e., it expanded no more nodes than any other admissible algorithm A no more informed than A*. These results were summarized in a book by one of us.","authors":["Peter E. Hart","Nils J.
