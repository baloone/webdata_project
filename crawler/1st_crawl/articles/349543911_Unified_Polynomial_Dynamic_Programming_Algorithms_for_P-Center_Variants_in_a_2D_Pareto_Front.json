{"id":"349543911_Unified_Polynomial_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithms_for_P-Center_Variants_in_a_2D_Pareto_Front","abstract":"With many efficient solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem, this paper aims to cluster the Pareto Front in a given number of clusters K and to detect isolated points. K-center problems and variants are investigated with a unified formulation considering the discrete and continuous versions, partial K-center problems, and their min-sum-K-radii variants. In dimension three (or upper), this induces NP-hard complexities. In the planar case, common optimality property is proven: non-nested optimal solutions exist. This induces a common dynamic programming algorithm running in polynomial time. Specific improvements hold for some variants, such as K-center problems and min-sum K-radii on a line. When applied to N points and allowing to uncover M<N points, K-center and min-sum-K-radii variants are, respectively, solvable in O(K(M+1)NlogN) and O(K(M+1)N2) time. Such complexity of results allows an efficient straightforward implementation. Parallel implementations can also be designed for a practical speed-up. Their application inside multi-objective heuristics is discussed to archive partial Pareto fronts, with a special interest in partial clustering variants.","authors":["Nicolas Dupin","Frank Nielsen","El-Ghazali Talbi"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.3390/math9040453","Project: Clustering algorithms in a 2d Pareto Front"],"references":["344082060_Matheuristics_to_optimize_refueling_and_maintenance_planning_of_nuclear_power_plants","342062835_A_comparative_study_of_high-productivity_high-performance_programming_languages_for_parallel_metaheuristics","340102772_Generalized_K-Core_Percolation_in_Networks_With_Community_Structure","336818546_On_generating_the_set_of_nondominated_solutions_of_a_linear_programming_problem_with_parameterized_fuzzy_numbers","330071289_Clustering-driven_evolutionary_algorithms_an_application_of_path_relinking_to_the_quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization_problem","326657438_Archivers_for_the_representation_of_the_set_of_approximate_solutions_for_MOPs","326552317_Dynamic_Programming_heuristic_for_k-means_Clustering_among_a_2-dimensional_Pareto_Frontier","339285995_Clustering_a_2d_Pareto_Front_P-center_Problems_Are_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time","333804328_K-Medoids_Clustering_Is_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time_for_a_2d_Pareto_Front","325468060_Two_New_Location_Covering_Problems_The_Partial_P_-Center_Problem_and_the_Partial_Set_Covering_Problem"]}
