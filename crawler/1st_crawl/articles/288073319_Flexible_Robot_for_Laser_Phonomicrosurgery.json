{"id":"288073319_Flexible_Robot_for_Laser_Phonomicrosurgery","abstract":"In this contribution we present a customized flexible robot developed as endoscopic device for laser phonomicrosurgery. Following the idea of soft robotics we describe the conventional clinical setting and adjunct benefits of the proposed assistance device to facilitate gentle surgery and usability in the operating room. Design constraints are obtained from medical image data implementing a mechanical design comprising compliant and flexible sections, actuation unit and multifunctional tip. We present results of a proof of concept experiment using a patient phantom, demonstrating the applicability of our system for laryngeal access.","authors":["Dennis Kundrat","Andreas Schoob","LÃ¼der Alexander Kahrs","Tobias Ortmaier"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44506-8_22","In book: Soft Robotics (pp.265-271)"],"references":["46221349_Transoral_laser_microsurgery_for_laryngeal_cancer_A_primer_and_review_of_laser_dosimetry","259491442_A_Novel_Computerized_Surgeon-Machine_Interface_for_Robot-Assisted_Laser_Phonomicrosurgery","224118650_A_Master-Slave_Robot_System_for_Minimally_Invasive_Laryngeal_Surgery","49838359_Transoral_Robotic_Surgery_of_the_Vocal_Cord","24261232_Curved_rigid_laryngoscope_Missing_link_between_direct_suspension_laryngoscopy_and_indirect_techniques"]}
