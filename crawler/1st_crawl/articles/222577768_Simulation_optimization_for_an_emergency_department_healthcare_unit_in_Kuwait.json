{"id":"222577768_Simulation_optimization_for_an_emergency_department_healthcare_unit_in_Kuwait","abstract":"This paper integrates simulation with optimization to design a decision support tool for the operation of an emergency department unit at a governmental hospital in Kuwait. The hospital provides a set of services for different categories of patients. We present a methodology that uses system simulation combined with optimization to determine the optimal number of doctors, lab technicians and nurses required to maximize patient throughput and to reduce patient time in the system subject to budget restrictions. The major objective of this decision supporting tool is to evaluate the impact of various staffing levels on service efficiency. Experimental results show that by using current hospital resources, the optimization simulation model generates optimal staffing allocation that would allow 28% increase in patient throughput and an average of 40% reduction in patientsâ€™ waiting time.","authors":["Mohamed A.
