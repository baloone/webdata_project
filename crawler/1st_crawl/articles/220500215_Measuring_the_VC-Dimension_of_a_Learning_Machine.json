{"id":"220500215_Measuring_the_VC-Dimension_of_a_Learning_Machine","abstract":"A method for measuring the capacity of learning machines is described. The method is based onfitting a theoretically derived function to empirical measurements of the maximal difference between theerror rates on two separate data sets of varying sizes. Experimental measurements of the capacity ofvarious types of linear classifiers are presented.1 Introduction.Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown the influence of the capacity of a learning machine onits generalization...","authors":["Vladimir Vapnik","Esther Levin","Yann Lecun"],"meta":["September 1994Neural Computation 6(5):851-876","DOI:10.1162/neco.1994.6.5.851","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221620459_Generalization_by_Weight-Elimination_with_Application_to_Forecasting","221619244_What_Size_Net_Gives_Valid_Generalization","236736810_The_necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_consistency_in_the_empirical_risk_minimization_method","233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities","222465340_Bounds_for_the_uniform_deviation_of_empirical_measures","221997108_Estimation_of_Dependence_Based_on_Empirical_Data","221619295_Structural_Risk_Minimization_for_Character_Recognition","30769828_Hints_and_the_VC_Dimension"]}
