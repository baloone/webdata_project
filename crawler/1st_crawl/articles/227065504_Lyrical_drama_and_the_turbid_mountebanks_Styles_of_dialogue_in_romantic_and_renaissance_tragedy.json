{"id":"227065504_Lyrical_drama_and_the_turbid_mountebanks_Styles_of_dialogue_in_romantic_and_renaissance_tragedy","abstract":"Critics have condemned English Romantic tragedies as a series of poor imitations of Renaissance tragedy. This paper tests such literary-critical questions through statistical comparisons of ten plays from each group. The measures chosen give evidence of a strong and consistent difference between the groups, going beyond historical changes in the language. The Romantic tragedies are more expository; the Renaissance ones include more commonplace interactions between characters. The later plays do not show the marked variations in function-word frequencies of their predecessors. Of the Renaissance plays, Shakespeare's show the closest affinity to the Romantic tragedies, and the most telling contrasts.","authors":["J. F. Burrows","D. H.
