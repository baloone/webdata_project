{"id":"257481459_Resolvability_in_circulant_graphs","abstract":"A set W of the vertices of a connected graph G is called a resolving set for G if for every two distinct vertices u, υ ∈ V (G) there is a vertex w ∈ W such that d(u,w) ≠ d(υ,w). A resolving set of minimum cardinality is called a metric basis for G and the number of vertices in a metric basis is called the metric dimension of G, denoted by dim(G). For a vertex u of G and a subset S of V (G), the distance between u and S is the number mins∈S\nd(u, s). A k-partition Π = {S\n1, S\n2, …, S\nk\n} of V (G) is called a resolving partition if for every two distinct vertices u, v ∈ V (G) there is a set S\ni\nin Π such that d(u, S\ni\n) ≠ d(v, S\ni\n). The minimum k for which there is a resolving k-partition of V (G) is called the partition dimension of G, denoted by pd(G). The circulant graph is a graph with vertex set ℤn\n, an additive group of integers modulo n, and two vertices labeled i and j adjacent if and only if i − j (mod n) ∈ C, where C ∈ ℤn\nhas the property that C = −C and 0 ∉ C. The circulant graph is denoted by X\nn,Δ where Δ = |C|. In this paper, we study the metric dimension of a family of circulant graphs X\nn,3 with connection set \n\n$C = \\left\\{ {1,\\tfrac{n}\n{2},n - 1} \\right\\}$\nand prove that dim(X\nn,3) is independent of choice of n by showing that \n\n$$\\dim \\left( {X_{n,3} } \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{gathered}\n3 for all n \\equiv 0 (mod 4), \\hfill \\\\\n4 for all n \\equiv 2 (mod 4). \\hfill \\\\\n\\end{gathered} \\right.$$\nWe also study the partition dimension of a family of circulant graphs X\nn,4 with connection set C = {±1,±2} and prove that pd(X\nn,4) is independent of choice of n and show that pd(X\n5,4) = 5 and \n\n$$pd\\left( {X_{n,4} } \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{gathered}\n3 for all odd n \\geqslant 9, \\hfill \\\\\n4 for all even n \\geqslant 6 and n = 7. \\hfill \\\\\n\\end{gathered} \\right.$$\n.","authors":["Muhammad Salman","Imran Javaid","Muhammad Anwar Chaudhry"],"meta":["August 2012Acta Mathematica Sinica 28(9):1851-1864","DOI:10.1007/s10114-012-0417-4"],"references":["267657439_Metric_dimension_of_wheels","264554503_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Petersen_Graphs","264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","265369650_Landmarks_in_torus_networks","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","259345760_On_the_Partition_Dimension_of_a_Graph","250686251_The_partition_dimension_of_a_graph","239476236_Computers_and_Inrracrobiliry_A_Guide_ro_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220532702_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Cartesian_Products_of_Graphs","226705873_On_k-dimensional_graphs_and_their_bases","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220632415_Metric_bases_in_digital_geometry"]}
