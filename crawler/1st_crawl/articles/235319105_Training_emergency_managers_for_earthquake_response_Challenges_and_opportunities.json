{"id":"235319105_Training_emergency_managers_for_earthquake_response_Challenges_and_opportunities","abstract":"Purpose – This paper aims to highlight the crucial role of decision makers and emergency managers in reducing the unpleasant consequences of disasters. Design/methodology/approach – An attempt has been made to clarify the measures for planning and implementation of training issues in earthquake emergency response for the emergency managers as an essential part at various managerial levels. Findings – The paper reveals that, although the high-level managers such as ministers are authoritative bodies for managing the routine problems of the country, in situations such as a “major emergency”, specific knowledge and experience of emergency issues are required for the emergency management to be successful. It also explores the ways and opportunities for achieving successful training programmes for the emergency managers. Research limitations/implications – The existing challenges, including the lack of adequate background knowledge and experience in emergency management, insufficient time to train, the inadequacy of the required technical supporting tools, and other related issues, emerge, which need to be identified. Practical implications – The research can be practically useful for emergency managers who are involved in response activities in disasters by providing suitable and appropriate recommendations for efficient training. Originality/value – There are only a few works on training of earthquake emergency managers, especially in developing countries such as Iran.","authors":["Mahmood Hosseini","Yasamin O.
