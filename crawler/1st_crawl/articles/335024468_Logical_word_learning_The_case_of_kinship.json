{"id":"335024468_Logical_word_learning_The_case_of_kinship","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a framework for conceptual development through the lens of program induction. We implement this framework to model the acquisition of kinship term concepts, resulting in the first formal developmental model for kinship acquisition. We demonstrate that our model can learn several kinship systems of varying complexity using cross-linguistic data from English, Pukapuka, Turkish and Yanomam√∂. More importantly, the behavioral patterns observed in children learning kinship terms, under-extension and over-generalization, fall out naturally from our learning model. We conducted interviews to simulate realistic learning environments and demonstrate that the characteristic-to-defining shift is a consequence of our learning model in naturalistic contexts containing abstract and concrete features. We use model simulations to discuss the influence of simplicity and learning environment on the order of acquisition of kinship terms, positing novel predictions for the learning trajectories of kinship terms. We conclude the paper with a discussion of how this model framework generalizes beyond kinship terms and the limitations of our model.","authors":["Francis Mollica","Steven T.
