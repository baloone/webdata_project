{"id":"327254915_Effects_and_costs_of_real-time_cardiac_telerehabilitation_Randomised_controlled_non-inferiority_trial","abstract":"Objective\nCompare the effects and costs of remotely monitored exercise-based cardiac telerehabilitation (REMOTE-CR) with centre-based programmes (CBexCR) in adults with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\nMethods\nParticipants were randomised to receive 12 weeks of telerehabilitation or centre-based rehabilitation. REMOTE-CR provided individualised exercise prescription, real-time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory-based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; CBexCR provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24 weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health-related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non-inferior between-group difference in V̇O2max at 12 weeks (inferiority margin=−1.25 mL/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes.\n\nResults\n162 participants (mean 61±12.7 years, 86% men) were randomised. V̇O2 max was comparable in both groups at 12 weeks and REMOTE-CR was non-inferior to CBexCR (REMOTE-CR-CBexCR adjusted mean difference (AMD)=0.51 (95% CI −0.97 to 1.98) mL/kg/min, p=0.48). REMOTE-CR participants were less sedentary at 24 weeks (AMD=−61.5 (95% CI −117.8 to −5.3) min/day, p=0.03), while CBexCR participants had smaller waist (AMD=1.71 (95% CI 0.09 to 3.34) cm, p=0.04) and hip circumferences (AMD=1.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 2.27) cm, p=0.04) at 12 weeks. No other between-group differences were detected. Per capita programme delivery (NZD1130/GBP573 vs NZD3466/GBP1758) and medication costs (NZD331/GBP168 vs NZD605/GBP307, p=0.02) were lower for REMOTE-CR. Hospital service utilisation costs were not statistically significantly different (NZD3459/GBP1754 vs NZD5464/GBP2771, p=0.20).\n\nConclusion\nREMOTE-CR is an effective, cost-efficient alternative delivery model that could—as a complement to existing services—improve overall utilisation rates by increasing reach and satisfying unique participant preferences.","authors":["Ralph Maddison","Jonathan C Rawstorn","Ralph A H Stewart","Jocelyne R Benatar"],"meta":["August 2018Heart (British Cardiac Society) 105(2):heartjnl-2018-313189","DOI:10.1136/heartjnl-2018-313189","Project: TeleHeartCoach: A 21st century approach to delivering exercise-based rehabilitation outside clinical centres"],"references":["317096896_Clinical_and_cost-effectiveness_of_home-based_cardiac_rehabilitation_compared_to_conventional_centre-based_cardiac_rehabilitation_Results_of_the_FITHome_study","304402512_Remotely_Delivered_Exercise-Based_Cardiac_Rehabilitation_Design_and_Content_Development_of_a_Novel_mHealth_Platform","319922472_Cardiac_telerehabilitation_A_novel_cost-efficient_care_delivery_strategy_that_can_induce_long-term_health_benefits","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","315591664_Prioritizing_Functional_Capacity_as_a_Principal_End_Point_for_Therapies_Oriented_to_Older_Adults_With_Cardiovascular_Disease_A_Scientific_Statement_for_Healthcare_Professionals_From_the_American_Heart","312002899_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination","303720845_Exercise-based_cardiac_rehabilitation_for_coronary_heart_disease","296681683_Telehealth_exercise-based_cardiac_rehabilitation_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","288169076_Self-Determination_Moderates_the_Effects_of_Perceived_Competence_on_Intrinsic_Motivation_in_an_Exercise_Setting"]}
