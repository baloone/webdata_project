{"id":"317559557_Challenges_in_static_data_acquisition_for_a_bus-on-demand_line","abstract":"An existing rigid bus line in the German city of Schorndorf (metropolitan region of Stuttgart) will be switched to an on-demand minibus regime without fixed stop points. This shall enable boarding and alighting literally at the travelers’ door steps. But not every inch of the public road network is suitable - for, i.a., legal, technical and structural reasons. Different static data needs to be merged into an enhanced network database to finally define and enumerate all allowed stop areas. While in theory all such data is available in the municipal electronic registries, in reality it is a big challenge to gather them or even newly create information.","authors":["Wolfgang Niebel","Anke Sauerländer-Biebl"],"meta":["June 2017","Conference: Workshop on Smart Mobility"],"references":[]}
