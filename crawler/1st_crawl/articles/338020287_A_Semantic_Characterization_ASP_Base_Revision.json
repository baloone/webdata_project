{"id":"338020287_A_Semantic_Characterization_ASP_Base_Revision","abstract":"The paper deals with base revision for Answer Set Programming (ASP). Base revision in classical logic is done by the removal of formulas. Exploiting the non-monotonicity of ASP allows one to propose other revision strategies, namely addition strategy or removal and/or addition strategy. These strategies allow one to define families of rule-based revision operators. The paper presents a semantic characterization of these families of revision operators in terms of answer sets. This semantic characterization allows for equivalently considering the evolution of syntactic logic programs and the evolution of their semantic content. It then studies the logical properties of the proposed operators and gives complexity results.","authors":["Laurent Garcia","Claire Lefèvre","Igor Stéphan","Odile Papini"],"meta":["December 2019Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 66:989-1029","DOI:10.1613/jair.1.11451"],"references":["326203804_Possibilistic_ASP_Base_Revision_by_Certain_Input","314183726_Reconsidering_AGM-Style_Belief_Revision_in_the_Context_of_Logic_Programs","301879263_A_New_Approach_for_Revising_Logic_Programs","279633396_Characterization_of_Logic_Program_Revision_as_an_Extension_of_Propositional_Revision","259224048_A_Model-Theoretic_Approach_to_Belief_Change_in_Answer_Set_Programming","259044196_Characterizing_and_Extending_Answer_Set_Semantics_using_Possibility_Theory","325672476_Answer_set_programming_unleashed","319676231_A_Semantic_Characterization_for_ASP_Base_Revision","314256945_Partial_Meet_Revision_and_Contraction_in_Logic_Programs","267092758_Extending_belief_base_change_to_logic_programs_with_ASP"]}
