{"id":"320674131_Self-determined_Learning_Heutagogy_and_Digital_Media_Creating_integrated_Educational_Environments_for_Developing_Lifelong_Learning_Skills","abstract":"Defined as the study of self-determined learning, heutagogy is a learner-centered educational theory founded on the key principles of learner agency, self-efficacy, capability, and metacognition (knowing how to learn) and reflection. Combined with today’s technologies, the theory provides a framework for designing and developing learner-centered environments that have the potential to equip learners with the necessary skills for a lifetime of learning. In addition, application of heutagogy has been to shown to promote themes of both social responsibility and justice, as well as a more democratic educational process. This chapter outlines the fundamental principles of heutagogy, or self-determined learning, and describes ways in which the theory can be applied, taking into consideration the critical and changing roles played by the student, teacher, and institution in creating a holistic, self-determined learning environment. In addition, the chapter also identifies technologies – in particular social media – that can be used to support development of self-determined learning.","authors":["Lisa Marie Blaschke"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-19925-8_10","In book: The Digital Turn in Higher Education (pp.129-140)"],"references":["323368854_New_Approach_to_Entrepreneurship_Education_in_Primary_Schools_The_BGENTL","312934097_Taking_social_media_to_a_university_classroom_teaching_and_learning_using_Twitter_and_blogs","308841710_A_move_towards_heutagogy_to_empower_theology_students","305778049_Self-determined_Learning_heutagogy_Where_Have_We_Come_Since_2000","305303430_Self-Determined_Learning_Designing_for_Heutagogic_Learning_Environments","303471239_Chapter_Reaching_Creating_in_Bloom's_Taxonomy_The_Merging_of_Heutagogy_and_Technology_in_Online_Learning","301339522_From_andragogy_to_heutagogy","288703644_Learner-Generated_Contexts_A_Framework_to_Support_the_Effective_Use_of_Technology_for_Learning","285747281_Theories_and_Applications_of_Massive_Online_Open_Courses_MOOCs_The_Case_for_Hybrid_Design","280717279_Heutagogy_A_holistic_framework_for_creating_21st_century_self-determined_learners","270884413_Critical_connections_Personal_learning_environments_and_information_literacy","268684323_Using_social_media_in_the_online_classroom","268684147_E-learning_and_self-determined_learning_skills","268388707_Using_social_media_to_engage_and_develop_the_online_learner_in_self-determined_learning","268078527_Riding_the_wave_of_BYOD_Developing_a_framework_for_creative_pedagogies","253650847_Establishing_a_foundation_for_reflective_practice_A_case_study_of_learning_journal_use","241891015_Heutagogy_and_Lifelong_Learning_A_Review_of_Heutagogical_Practice_and_Self-Determined_Learning","235633464_Smartphones_give_you_wings_Pedagogical_affordances_of_mobile_Web_20","228640669_Social_Software_and_Participatory_Learning_Pedagogical_Choices_with_Technology_Affordances_in_the_Web_20_Era","37357676_Heutagogy_A_Child_of_Complexity_Theory","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","295401217_Rethinking_learning_for_a_digital_age_how_learners_shape_their_experiences","286272795_Self_Directed_Learning_A_Guide_for_Learners_and_Teachers","284789490_How_critical_reflection_triggers_transformative_learning_in_fostering_critical_reflection_in_adulthood","281453155_Mindset_The_New_Psychology_of_Success","274769321_Quality_in_Learning_A_Capability_Approach_in_Higher_Education","255665269_Sustainability_in_the_Synapses_Neuroplasticity_and_Transformative_Learning","251964134_Handbook_of_Emerging_Technologies_for_Learning","233896451_Perceived_Self-Efficacy_in_Cognitive_Development_and_Functioning","220040705_A_Theory_of_Human_Motivation","215439083_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Professionals_Think_In_Action","28147808_Organizational_Learning_A_Theory_of_Action_Perspective"]}
