{"id":"347869738_Indigeneity_and_spatial_information_science","abstract":"Spatial information science has given rise to a set of concepts, tools, and techniques for understanding our geographic world. In turn, the technologies built on this body of knowledge embed certain ways of knowing.\" This vision paper traces the roots and impacts of those embeddings and explores how they can sometimes be inherently at odds with or completely subvert Indigenous Peoples' ways of knowing. However advancements in spatial information science offer opportunities for innovation whilst working towards reconciliation. We highlight as examples four active research topics in the field to support a call to action for greater inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in spatial information science.\"","authors":["Matt Duckham","Serene Ho"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Spatial Information Science 21(21)","DOI:10.5311/JOSIS.2020.21.725"],"references":["341255746_Indigenous_data_sovereignty","338597851_Innovative_Remote_Sensing_Methodologies_for_Kenyan_Land_Tenure_Mapping","337915603_Barapa_Country_through_Barapa_eyes_cultural_mapping_of_Gunbower_Island_Australia","335263443_Using_Two-Eyed_Seeing_in_Research_With_Indigenous_People_An_Integrative_Review","335236693_Developing_a_Framework_for_National_Institutional_Arrangements_in_Geospatial_Information_Management","334352143_Constellations_of_indigeneity_The_power_of_definition","330530841_Using_two-eyed_seeing_to_bridge_Western_science_and_Indigenous_knowledge_systems_and_understand_long-term_change_in_the_Saskatchewan_River_Delta_Canada","329074453_An_Application_of_Two-Eyed_Seeing_Indigenous_Research_Methods_With_Participatory_Action_Research","345508349_Indigeneity","330681574_Do_geospatial_ontologies_perpetuate_Indigenous_assimilation"]}
