{"id":"314856536_The_Best-of-n_Problem_in_Robot_Swarms_Formalization_State_of_the_Art_and_Novel_Perspectives","abstract":"The ability to collectively choose the best among a finite set of alternatives is a fundamental cognitive skill for robot swarms. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of the best-of-n problem and a taxonomy that details its possible variants. Based on this taxonomy, we analyze the swarm robotics literature focusing on the decision-making problem dealt with by the swarm. We find that, so far, the literature has primarily focused on certain variants of the best-of-n problem, while other variants have been the subject of only a few isolated studies. Additionally, we consider a second taxonomy about the design methodologies used to develop collective decision-making strategies. Based on this second taxonomy, we provide an in-depth survey of the literature that details the strategies proposed so far and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of current design methodologies.","authors":["Gabriele Valentini","Eliseo Ferrante","Marco Dorigo"],"meta":["March 2017Frontiers in Robotics and AI 4","DOI:10.3389/frobt.2017.00009","Project: Collective decision making"],"references":["316472283_Percolation_Centrality_Quantifying_Graph-Theoretic_Impact_of_Nodes_during_Percolation_in_Networks","307144418_Collective_Perception_of_Environmental_Features_in_a_Robot_Swarm","301252549_Hybrid_Societies_Challenges_and_Perspectives_in_the_Design_of_Collective_Behavior_in_Self-organizing_Systems","301232811_Self-Organized_Shortcuts_in_the_Argentine_Ant","341690936_Self-Organization_in_Biological_Systems","327745510_Formal_Verification_of_Opinion_Formation_in_Swarms","326294322_Cognitive_micro-Agents_individual_and_collective_perception_in_microrobotic_swarm","316824230_Space-Time_Continuous_Models_of_Swarm_Robotic_Systems","316806492_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","306386227_A_Collective_Behaviour_Framework_for_Multi-agent_Systems"]}
