{"id":"275170474_Transient_thermal_Ansys_analysis_of_dry_contacts_-_Application_to_automotive_braking","abstract":"Braking operation is a process which converts the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the vehicle into other energies. The major part of the mechanical energy is transformed into heat. During the braking phase, the frictional heat generated at the interface disc-pads can lead to high temperatures. This phenomenon is even more important that the tangential stress as well as the relative sliding speeds in contact are important. The objective of this study is to analyse the thermal behavior of the full and ventilated brake discs of the vehicles using computing code ANSYS. The modeling of the temperature distribution in the disc brake is used to identify all the factors and the entering parameters concerned at the time of the braking operation such as the type of braking, the geometric design of the disc and the used material. The results obtained by the numerical simulation are satisfactory compared with those of the specialized literature.","authors":["Ali Belhocine","Mostefa Bouchetara"],"meta":["January 2012Mechanics and Industry 13(1):45-57","DOI:10.1051/meca/2011149","Project: EXPLORE THE BEST AND OFFER IT"],"references":["259042091_Velocity_and_Relative_Contact_Size_Effects_on_the_Thermal_Constriction_Resistance_in_Sliding_Solids","344083168_An_Analytical_Method_to_Predict_Thermal_Distortion_of_a_Brake_Rotor","344045980_Study_on_Crack_Initiation_at_Small_Holes_of_One-piece_Brake_Discs","312600709_Thermal_simulation_of_a_dry_sliding_contact_using_a_multiscale_model_-_Application_to_the_braking_problem","300576595_Evaluation_of_Gray_Iron_Brake_Discs_for_Trucks_By_Thermal_Modeling","296656814_A_Theoretical_Prediction_of_Disc_Brake_Temperatures_and_a_Comparison_with_Experimental_Data","288155480_Ventilated_Brake_Rotor_Air_Flow_Investigation","285039868_Heat_transfer_from_a_rotating_cylinder_with_and_without_crossflow","270739997_Thermal_Contact_Simulation_in_2-D_and_3-D_Mechanisms","268646335_Hydrodynamic_Resistance_and_Heat_Loss_of_Rotating_Solids","260350190_An_Analytical_Method_to_Predict_Thermal_Distortion_of_a_Brake_Rotor","259042677_Effect_of_thickness_and_physical_properties_of_films_on_the_thermal_behavior_of_a_moving_rough_interface","259042263_Aspect_thermique_du_frottement_mise_en_evidence_experimentale_et_elements_de_modelisation","245322912_Transient_Temperature_and_Thermal_Stress_Distributions_in_a_Hollow_Disk_Subjected_to_a_Moving_Uniform_Heat_Source","245213471_Thermal_behaviour_of_rollers_during_the_rolling_process","245075232_Analytical_solution_of_unsteady_heat_conduction_in_a_two-layered_material_in_imperfect_contact_subjected_to_a_moving_heat_source","245075023_Three-dimensional_stationary_thermal_behavior_of_a_bearing_ball","238166613_Thermal_impedance_and_transient_temperature_due_to_a_spot_of_heat_on_a_half-space","237120200_Evaluating_new_ways_of_conducting_convective_heat_dissipation_experiments_with_ventilated_brake_discs","236436617_Development_of_Disc-Brake_Design_Method_Using_Computer_Simulation_of_Heat_Phenomena","231013479_Transient_temperatures_attained_in_disk_brakes","229349606_Modelling_of_heat_transfer_between_two_rollers_in_dry_friction","42101119_Effect_of_thickness_and_physical_properties_of_films_on_the_thermal_behavior_of_a_moving_rough_interface","37425639_Konvektive_Warmeubertragung_-_Herausgegeben_von_Ulrich_Grigull"]}
