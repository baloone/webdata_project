{"id":"225129893_A_Rule-Based_Language_for_Complex_Event_Processing_and_Reasoning","abstract":"Complex Event Processing (CEP) is concerned with timely detection of complex events within multiple streams of atomic occurrences.\nIt has useful applications in areas including financial services, mobile and sensor devices, click stream analysis etc. Numerous\napproaches in CEP have already been proposed in the literature. Event processing systems with a logic-based representation\nhave attracted considerable attention as (among others reasons) they feature formal semantics and offer reasoning service.\nHowever logic-based approaches are not optimized for run-time event recognition (as they are mainly query-driven systems).\nIn this paper, we present an expressive logic-based language for specifying and combining complex events. For this language\nwe provide both a syntax as well as a formal declarative semantics. The language enables efficient run time event recognition\nand supports deductive reasoning. Execution model of the language is based on a compilation strategy into Prolog. We provide\nan implementation of the language, and present the performance results showing the competitiveness of our approach.","authors":["Darko Anicic","Paul Fodor","Sebastian Rudolph","Roland St√ºhmer"],"meta":["January 1970","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15918-3_5","SourceDBLP","Conference: International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems"],"references":["225144320_ETALIS_Rule-based_reasoning_in_event_processing","220693129_Event_Processing_in_Action"]}
