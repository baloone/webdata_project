{"id":"255724072_Young_children's_musical_experiences_with_a_flow_machine","abstract":"In the field of the studies on creativity is placed the Theory of Flow introduced by Csikszentmiahlyi (1990) in order to describe the state of Flow, or \"optimal experience\", experimented by the creative persons during their preferred activities At the Sony Computer Science Laboratory, an innovative system was elabo-rated able to produce music in the same style as the person play-ing the keyboard, the Continuator. The ability of the system to attract and hold the attention of children could be interpreted through the theory of Flow (Pachet 2006). The DiaMuse project is carrying out dealing with the interaction between young chil-dren and the Continuator. During the interaction with the system, the children seem to reach high levels of \"well-being\" and crea-tivity, very similar to those described by Csikszentmiahlyi. We also noticed the presence of the flow indicators as observed by Custodero (2005) in musical experiences. An observation grid was realized in order to analyse in details the emotive tones de-scribed in the Theory of Flow.","authors":["Anna Rita Addessi","Laura Ferrari","Simona Carlotti","Francois Pachet"],"meta":["August 2006","Conference: ICMPC/ESCOM Conference 2006"],"references":["266611042_ESPERIENZA_DI_FLOW_E_SVILUPPO_DELLA_COMPLESSITA'_NEL_COMPORTAMENTO_UMANO","255785627_Young_children_confronting_the_Continuator_an_interactive_reflective_musical_system","249038300_Seeking_Challenge_Finding_Skill_Flow_Experience_and_Music_Education","240528071_Observable_indicators_of_flow_experience_A_developmental_perspective_on_musical_engagement_in_young_children_from_infancy_to_school_age","234660787_Observing_Flow_in_Young_Children's_Music_Learning","312325049_The_Science_and_Psychology_of_Music_Performance_Creative_Strategies_for_Teaching_and_Learning","270819462_The_Science_Psychology_of_Music_Performance_Creative_Strategies_for_Teaching_and_Learning","258173094_Musicality_and_the_Intrinsic_Motive_Pulse_Evidence_from_Human_Psychobiology_and_Infant_Communication","248129620_Towards_a_psychology_of_optimal_experience","237131019_Music_interaction_with_style"]}
