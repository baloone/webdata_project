{"id":"331271500_An_ICA_Algorithm_for_Separation_of_Convolutive_Mixture_of_Periodic_Signals","abstract":"Abstract - This paper describes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based fixed-point algorithm for the blind separation of convolutive mixture of periodical signals. The proposed algorithm extracts independent periodical sources from their mixtures in frequency domain, where they are represented by their sets of harmonics. The individual harmonics are separated by referring to narrow frequency segments of the mixed signals, which include two harmonics each at most. The algorithm offers a simple solution to the permutation problem common to source separation using ICA","authors":["Doron Benzvi","Adam Shafir"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICSEE.2018.8646002","Conference: 2018 IEEE International Conference on the Science of Electrical Engineering in Israel (ICSEE)"],"references":["242607663_An_ICA_Algorithm_for_Separation_of_Convolutive_Mixture_of_Speech_Signals","40759123_Robust_Independent_Component_Analysis_by_Iterative_Maximization_of_the_Kurtosis_Contrast_With_Algebraic_Optimal_Step_Size","15614030_An_Information-Maximization_Approach_to_Blind_Separation_and_Blind_Deconvolution","2578928_Blind_Separation_Of_Convolved_Sources_Based_On_Information_Maximization","303931136_Blind_Separation_of_Time-Delayed_and_Convolved_Sources","237067978_Independent_Component_Analysis","229430930_Independent_Component_Analysis_in_Image_Processing","220550091_Blind_separation_of_convolved_mixtures_in_the_frequency_domain"]}
