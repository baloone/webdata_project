{"id":"320250407_Multiview_Intensity-Based_Active_Learning_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","abstract":"In remote sensing image classification, active learning aims to learn a good classifier as best as possible by choosing the most valuable (informative and representative) training samples. Multiview is a concept that regards analyzing the same object from multiple different views. Generally, these views show diversity and complementarity of features. In this paper, we propose a new multiview active learning (MVAL) framework for hyperspectral image classification. First, we generate multiple views by extracting different attribute components from the same image data. Specifically, we adopt the multiple morphological component analysis to decompose the original image into multiple pairs of attribute components, including content, coarseness, contrast, and directionality, and the smooth component from each pair is chosen as one single view. Second, we construct two multiview intensity-based query strategies for active learning. On the one hand, we exploit the intensity differences of multiple views along with the samples' uncertainty to choose the most informative candidates. On the other hand, we consider the clustering distribution of all unlabeled samples, and query the most representative candidates in addition to the highly informative ones. Our experiments are performed on four benchmark hyperspectral image data sets. The obtained results show that the proposed MVAL framework can lead to better classification performance than the traditional, single-view active learning schemes. In addition, compared with the conventional disagree-based MVAL scheme, the proposed query selection strategies show competitive classification accuracy.","authors":["Xiang Xu","Jun Li","Shutao Li"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TGRS.2017.2752738"],"references":["236980570_Active_Learning_Any_Value_for_Classification_of_Remotely_Sensed_Data","234574749_Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation","225138938_Representative_Sampling_for_Text_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","224400298_Active_Learning_Methods_for_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","224227700_A_Survey_of_Active_Learning_Algorithms_for_Supervised_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","221620001_Two_view_learning_SVM-2K_Theory_and_Practice","221619711_Active_Learning_by_Querying_Informative_and_Representative_Examples","221618483_Bayesian_Co-Training","221617806_PAC_Generalization_Bounds_for_Co-training","221345436_Automatic_Feature_Decomposition_for_Single_View_Co-training","221112598_Multi-view_Discriminative_Sequential_Learning","221112363_Dual-Strategy_Active_Learning","220543083_Active_Learning_with_Multiple_Views","220321064_Active_Learning_to_Recognize_Multiple_Types_of_Plankton","3200446_A_transformation_for_ordering_multispectral_data_in_terms_of_image_quality_with_implications_for_noise_removal","2490883_A_Sequential_Algorithm_for_Training_Text_Classifiers","317272305_Remote_Sensing_Scene_Classification_by_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning","314818847_Combining_clustering_and_co-training_to_enhance_text_classification_using_unlabelled_data","314512980_Active_Learning_with_Multiple_Views","301599482_Wavelet-Domain_Multiview_Active_Learning_for_Spatial-Spectral_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","296624554_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Multispectral_Change_Detection","291206513_Multiple_Morphological_Component_Analysis_Based_Decomposition_for_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification","288940839_An_Implementation_of_the_algorithme_a_trous_to_Compute_the_Wavelet_Transform","285259681_Multi-source_Transfer_Learning_with_Multi-view_Adaboost","281018137_Image_decomposition_via_the_combination_of_sparse_representations_and_a_variational_approach","279232674_Projection-Based_NMF_for_Hyperspectral_Unmixing","272387856_Substance_Dependence_Constrained_Sparse_NMF_for_Hyperspectral_Unmixing","263476029_Machine_learning_Clustering_by_fast_search_and_find_of_density_peaks","258792852_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data_Using_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_and_Active_Learning","257436121_A_survey_of_multi-view_machine_learning","254058517_View_Generation_for_Multiview_Maximum_Disagreement_Based_Active_Learning_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","224223288_Active_Learning_via_Multi-View_and_Local_Proximity_Co-Regularization_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","221417102_Multi-view_Transfer_Learning_with_Adaboost","221346109_Hierarchical_sampling_for_active_learning","221344734_Employing_EM_and_Pool-Based_Active_Learning_for_Text_Classification","221165428_Synthesis_of_maximum_margin_and_multiview_learning_using_unlabeled_data","221139317_An_Algorithm_on_Multi-View_Adaboost","221139040_Hierarchical_Multi-view_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis","221012741_An_Analysis_of_Active_Learning_Strategies_for_Sequence_Labeling_Tasks","220871780_View_Construction_for_Multi-view_Semi-supervised_Learning","220549749_Active_learning_with_extremely_sparse_labeled_examples","220320586_Sparse_Semi-supervised_Learning_Using_Conjugate_Functions","7528563_Image_Decomposition_via_the_Combination_of_Sparse_Representations_and_a_Variational_Approach","3116409_Textural_Features_Corresponding_to_Visual_Perception","2951835_Active_Learning_Using_Pre-clustering","2948032_Active_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Information_Extraction","2937029_Analyzing_the_Effectiveness_and_Applicability_Of_Co-Training","2576903_Selective_Sampling_Using_the_Query_by_Committee_Algorithm","2457211_Combining_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Data_with_Co-Training","2419897_Committee-Based_Sampling_For_Training_Probabilistic_Classifiers"]}
