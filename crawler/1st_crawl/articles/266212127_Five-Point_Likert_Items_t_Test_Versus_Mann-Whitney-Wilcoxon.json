{"id":"266212127_Five-Point_Likert_Items_t_Test_Versus_Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon","abstract":"Likert questionnaires are widely used in survey research, but it is unclear whether the item data should be investigated by means of parametric or nonparametric procedures. This study compared the Type I and II error rates of the t test versus the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) for five-point Likert items. Fourteen population distributions were defined and pairs of samples were drawn from the populations and submitted to the t test and the t test on ranks, which yields the same results as MWW. The results showed that the two tests had equivalent power for most of the pairs. MWW had a power advantage when one of the samples was drawn from a skewed or peaked distribution. Strong power differences between the t test and MWW occurred when one of the samples was drawn from a multimodal distribution. Notably, the Type I error rate of both methods was never more than 3% above the nominal rate of 5%, even not when sample sizes were highly unequal. In conclusion, for five-point Likert items, the t test and MWW generally have similar power, and researchers do not have to worry about finding a difference whilst there is none in the population. Likert scales are widely used in various domains such as behavioral sciences, healthcare, marketing, and usability research. When responding to a Likert scale, participants specify their level of agreement to statements with typically five or seven ordered response levels. Likert item data have distinct characteristics: discrete instead of continuous values, tied numbers, and restricted range.","authors":["Joost de Winter","Dimitra Dodou"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["247728522_The_Effects_of_Nonnormality_on_Parametric_Nonparametric_and_Model_Comparison_Approaches_to_Pairwise_Comparisons","247331493_Rank_Transformations_as_a_Bridge_Between_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistics_Rejoinder","329472786_The_Wilcoxon_Test_and_Non-Null_Hypotheses","313552746_The_relative_power_of_parametric_and_nonparametric_statistical_methods","267855325_Analyzing_Data_Measured_By_Individual_Likert-Type_Items","250750543_Two_separate_effects_of_variance_heterogeneity_on_the_validity_and_power_of_significance_tests_of_location","249797455_Consequences_of_Failure_to_Meet_Assumptions_Underlying_the_Fixed_Effects_Analyses_of_Variance_and_Covariance","247725147_Weak_Measurements_vs_Strong_Statistics_An_Empirical_Critique_of_S_S_Stevens'_Proscriptions_nn_Statistics","241735631_A_Monte_Carlo_Study_Comparing_Various_Two-Sample_Tests_for_Differences_in_Mean","240802018_A_Comparison_of_the_Power_of_Wilcoxon's_Rank-Sum_Statistic_to_That_of_Student's_t_Statistic_Under_Various_Nonnormal_Distributions","240278693_Single-Item_Versus_Multiple-Item_Measurement_Scales_An_Empirical_Comparison","232587963_Is_There_an_Optimal_Number_of_Alternatives_for_Likert-Scale_Items_Study_I","233218474_Robustness_of_the_Two-Sample_t-Test_Under_Violations_of_the_Homogeneity_of_Variance_Assumption","232868027_Power_Type_I_and_Type_III_Error_Rates_of_Parametric_and_Nonparametric_Statistical_Tests","232540301_Analysis_or_Ordinal_Data_to_Detect_Population_Differences"]}
