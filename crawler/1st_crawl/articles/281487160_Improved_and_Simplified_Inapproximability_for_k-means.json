{"id":"281487160_Improved_and_Simplified_Inapproximability_for_k-means","abstract":"The k-means problem consists of finding k centers in the d-dimensional\nEuclidean space that minimize the sum of the squared distances of all points in\nan input set P to their closest respective center. Awasthi et. al. recently\nshowed that there exists a constant c > 1 such that it is NP-hard to\napproximate the k-means objective within a factor of c. We establish that the\nconstant c is at least 1.0013.","authors":["Euiwoong Lee","Melanie Schmidt","John Wright"],"meta":["September 2015Information Processing Letters 120(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2016.11.009","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234804011_Applications_of_weighted_Voronoi_diagrams_and_randomization_to_variance-based-clustering","228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","221013402_The_Planar_k-Means_Problem_is_NP-Hard","220984093_Applications_of_Weighted_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_Randomization_to_Variance-Based","220343586_NP-hardness_of_Euclidean_sum-of-squares_clustering","51910402_A_Unified_Framework_for_Approximating_and_Clustering_Data","272194462_The_Hardness_of_Approximation_of_Euclidean_k-means","222750577_Complexity_of_approximating_bounded_variants_of_optimization_problems","222543557_A_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-Means_Clustering","221669789_Probability_and_Computing_Randomized_Algorithms_and_Probabilistic_Analysis","220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM's","2902436_On_the_Hardness_of_Approximating_Minimum_Vertex_Cover"]}
