This program offers a great variety of Web 3.0 ways of work, as it makes possible to visit web sites using avatars created for that purpose. The Universities should be familiar with the creation of new metaverses. That is the reason why a new basic methodology for the creation of a course on expert systems within a metaverse in a virtual campus for e-learning. Besides the creation of a repository or island, it is necessary to make measurements of the performance of the server dedicated to host the system when the number of users of the application grows. In order to forecast the behavior of such servers, ARIMA based time series are used. The auto-correlogrames obtained are analyzed to formulate a statistical model, as close to reality as possible","authors":["Ruben Gonzalez Crespo","Roberto Ferro Escobar","Luis Joyanes Aguilar","Sandra Yanet Velazco"],"meta":["June 2013Expert Systems with Applications 40(18)","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2013.06.054"],"references":["235450772_Dynamic_ecological_accessible_and_3D_Virtual_Worlds-based_Libraries_using_OpenSim_and_Sloodle_along_with_mobile_location_and_NFC_for_checking_in","232620521_Knowledge_Representation_with_Ontologies_The_Present_and_Future","228576150_Engineering_an_E-learning_application_using_the_ARL_Theory_for_Agent_Oriented_Software_Engineering","228549339_The_semantics_of_markup_Mapping_legacy_markup_schemas_to_a_common_semantics","224169974_Games_Methodologies_and_Immersive_Environments_for_Virtual_Fieldwork","224123856_An_introduction_to_OpenSimulator_and_virtual_environment_agent-based_MS_applications","221106226_Mapping_XML_to_OWL_ontologies","220047110_Sampling_in_Open_Source_Software_Development_The_Case_for_Using_the_Debian_GNULinux_Distribution","2802703_The_semantic_web_-_On_the_respective_roles_of_XML_and_RDF","288958123_Gretl_user's_guide_ARIMA_time-series","252033179_GNU_GPL_in_studying_programs_from_the_Systems_Engineering_field","246530692_Introduction_to_Storage_Area_Networks","242370271_Extended_Towards_Ontology-Based_Intelligent_Model_for_Intrusion_Detection_and_Prevention","235890207_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Prentice_Hall","232617777_Web_30_A_Real_Personal_Web_More_Opportunities_and_More_Threats","229059938_Expert_Systems_Principles_and_Programming","226960365_Updating_the_Mammalian_Cell_Cycle_The_Role_of_Interphase_Cdks_in_Tissue_Homeostasis_and_Cancer","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","224266596_VISIE_A_spatially_immersive_interaction_environment_using_real-time_human_measurement","224124751_Web_Services_for_Learning_Management_Systems_Communication_Architecture","221475393_A_Resource_Management_Architecture_for_Metacomputing_Systems","221271528_Towards_Ontology-Based_Intelligent_Model_for_Intrusion_Detection_and_Prevention","31732379_An_Introduction_to_Fuzzy_Logic_and_Fuzzy_Sets_JJ_Buckley_E_Eslami","3248245_MySQL_Lessons_learned_on_a_digital_library","2299640_A_Resource_Management_Architecture_for_Metacomputing_Systems"]}
