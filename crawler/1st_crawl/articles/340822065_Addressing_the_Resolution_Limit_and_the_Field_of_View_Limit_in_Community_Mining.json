{"id":"340822065_Addressing_the_Resolution_Limit_and_the_Field_of_View_Limit_in_Community_Mining","abstract":"We introduce a novel efficient approach for community detection based on a formal definition of the notion of community. We name the links that run between communities weak links and links being inside communities strong links. We put forward a new objective function, called SIWO (Strong Inside, Weak Outside) which encourages adding strong links to the communities while avoiding weak links. This process allows us to effectively discover communities in social networks without the resolution and field of view limit problems some popular approaches suffer from. The time complexity of this new method is linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various real and artificial datasets with large and small communities.","authors":["Shiva Zamani","Osmar R.
