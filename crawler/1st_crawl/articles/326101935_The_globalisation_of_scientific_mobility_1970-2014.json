{"id":"326101935_The_globalisation_of_scientific_mobility_1970-2014","abstract":"This article provides an empirical assessment of global scientific mobility over the past four decades, based on bibliometric data. We find (i) an increasing diversity of origin and destination countries integrated in global scientific mobility, with (ii) the centre of gravity of scientific knowledge production and migration destinations moving continuously eastwards by about 1300 km per decade, (iii) an increase in average migration distances of scientists reflecting integration of global peripheries into the global science system, (iv) significantly lower mobility frictions for internationally mobile scientists compared to non-scientist migrants, (v) with visa restrictions establishing a statistically significant barrier affecting international mobility of scientists hampering the global diffusion of scientific knowledge.","authors":["Mathias Czaika","Sultan Orazbayev"],"meta":["July 2018Applied Geography 96:1-10","DOI:10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.04.017"],"references":["316342846_Visa_restrictions_and_economic_globalisation","272086215_Visualising_Migration_Flow_Data_with_Circular_Plots","262864594_A_bibliometric_approach_to_tracking_international_scientific_migration","261186924_Quantifying_Global_International_Migration_Flows","258190226_Science_in_the_system_of_world_society","240696566_International_Labour_Mobility_and_Uneven_Regional_Development_in_Europe","237827782_From_Brain_Drain_to_Brain_Circulation_Transnational_Communities_and_Regional_Upgrading_in_India_and_China","234054722_International_Collaboration_in_Science_The_Global_Map_and_the_Network","227593045_International_Migration_A_Panel_Data_Analysis_of_the_Determinants_of_Bilateral_Flows","227561687_The_Global_Economy's_Shifting_Centre_of_Gravity","5186192_Does_Globalization_Of_The_ScientificEngineering_Workforce_Threaten_US_Economic_Leadership","4928544_What_is_Research_Collaboration","4734065_Gravity_With_Gravitas_A_Solution_to_the_Border_Puzzle","319286814_International_knowledge_flows_and_the_administrative_barriers_to_mobility","318727085_Globalisation_and_the_university_Myths_and_realities_in_an_unequal_world","316743735_International_academic_mobility_across_space_and_time_The_case_of_Indian_academics","314968057_The_Gravity_of_High-Skilled_Migration_Policies","314911961_Do_Free_Trade_Agreements_Actually_Increase_Members'_International_Trade","314572745_Migrant_Scientists_and_International_Networks","312964327_International_mobility_of_highly_skilled_workers_From_statistical_analysis_to_policy_formulation","302982921_The_Effect_of_Visas_on_Migration_Processes","299952261_Which_Factors_Influence_the_International_Mobility_of_Research_Scientists","273391100_A_Practitioners'_Guide_to_Gravity_Models_of_International_Migration","264464952_The_International_Mobility_of_Academics_A_Labour_Market_Perspective","262492737_The_Globalization_of_Migration_Has_the_World_Become_More_Migratory","259547604_What_Separates_Us_Sources_of_Resistance_to_Globalization","257663145_Studying_scientific_migration_in_Scopus","254435384_The_Role_of_Income_and_Immigration_Policies_on_International_Migrations","228241155_Notes_on_CEPII's_distances_measures_The_GeoDist_database","227733492_Towards_a_New_Map_of_European_Migration","227691937_Moving_People_and_Knowledge_Scientific_Mobility_in_the_European_Union1","222407161_Do_Free_Trade_Agreements_Actually_Increase_Members'_International_Trade","220434223_Assessing_the_Scholarly_Impact_of_Information_Studies_A_Tale_of_Two_Citation_Databases-Scopus_and_Web_of_Science","47069656_The_World_is_Flat_A_Brief_History_of_the_Twenty-First_Century","44840952_The_Global_Competition_for_Talent_Mobility_of_the_Highly_Skilled","4889455_Information_Technology_and_the_Future_of_Cities"]}
