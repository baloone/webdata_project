{"id":"226218829_On_the_Correlation_of_Symmetric_Functions","abstract":"Thecorrelation between two Boolean functions ofn inputs is defined as the number of times the functions agree minus the number of times they disagree, all divided by 2\nn\n. In this paper we compute, in closed form, the correlation between any twosymmetric Boolean functions. As a consequence of our main result, we get that every symmetric Boolean function having an odd period\nhas anexponentially small correlation (inn) with the parity function. This improves a result of Smolensky [12] restricted to symmetric Boolean functions: the correlation\nbetween parity and any circuit consisting of a Mod\nq\ngate over AND gates of small fan-in, whereq is odd and the function computed by the sum of the AND gates is symmetric, is bounded by 2−Ω(n).\n\nIn addition, we find that for a large class of symmetric functions the correlation with parity isidentically zero for infinitely manyn. We characterize exactly those symmetric Boolean functions having this property.","authors":["Jin -Yi Cai","Frederic Green","T.
