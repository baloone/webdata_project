{"id":"356287516_TopoResNet_A_Hybrid_Deep_Learning_Architecture_and_Its_Application_to_Skin_Lesion_Classification","abstract":"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to various medical subfields has been a popular topic of research in recent years. In particular, {deep} learning has been widely used and has proven effective in many cases. Topological data analysis (TDA)---a rising field at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computer science---offers new insights into data. In this work, we develop a novel deep learning architecture that we call TopoResNet that integrates topological information into the residual neural network architecture. To demonstrate TopoResNet, we apply it to a skin lesion classification problem. We find that TopoResNet improves the accuracy and the stability of the training process.","authors":["Chuan-Shen Hu","Austin Lawson","Jung Sheng Chen","Yu-Min Chung"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.3390/math9222924"],"references":["349702063_A_Persistent_Homology_Approach_to_Heart_Rate_Variability_Analysis_With_an_Application_to_Sleep-Wake_Classification","342508308_Brain_Extraction_on_MRI_Scans_in_Presence_of_Diffuse_Glioma_Multi-institutional_Performance_Evaluation_of_Deep_Learning_Methods_and_Robust_Modality-Agnostic_Training","342332682_Deep_learning_with_noisy_labels_Exploring_techniques_and_remedies_in_medical_image_analysis","342065518_Smooth_Summaries_of_Persistence_Diagrams_and_Texture_Classification","340532669_Predicting_motor_outcome_in_preterm_infants_from_very_early_brain_diffusion_MRI_using_a_deep_learning_convolutional_neural_network_CNN_model","340120989_A_Novel_Hybrid_Deep_Learning_Model_for_Sentiment_Classification","339208451_A_Novel_Hybrid_Deep_Neural_Network_to_Predict_Pre-impact_Fall_for_Older_People_Based_on_Wearable_Inertial_Sensors","338549485_Skin_cancer_detection_Applying_a_deep_learning_based_model_driven_architecture_in_the_cloud_for_classifying_dermal_cell_images_Elsevier_Enhanced_Reader","340270465_A_fast_graph-based_algorithm_for_automated_segmentation_of_subcutaneous_and_visceral_adipose_tissue_in_3D_abdominal_computed_tomography_images","338758162_A_Weight_Perturbation-Based_Regularisation_Technique_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_the_Application_in_Medical_Imaging","336759665_Deep_learning_technology_for_improving_cancer_care_in_society_New_directions_in_cancer_imaging_driven_by_artificial_intelligence","334841829_A_hybrid_deep_learning_image-based_analysis_for_effective_malware_detection","336981151_An_automated_method_for_segmentation_and_quantification_of_blood_vessels_in_histology_images","334841655_Medical_image_segmentation_algorithm_based_on_feedback_mechanism_convolutional_neural_network","334230148_Automated_pancreas_segmentation_from_computed_tomography_and_magnetic_resonance_images_A_systematic_review"]}
