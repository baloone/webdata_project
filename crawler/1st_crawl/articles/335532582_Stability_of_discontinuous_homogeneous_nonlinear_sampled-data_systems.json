{"id":"335532582_Stability_of_discontinuous_homogeneous_nonlinear_sampled-data_systems","abstract":"The article deals with the stability of discontinuous homogeneous nonlinear systems with aperiodic sampled-data inputs. We first extend results about robustness of homogeneous nonlinear systems to the discontinuous case. Then, we prove that this framework is well suited for studying the stability of discontinuous homogeneous nonlinear sampled-data systems. The results are illustrated on the double integrator.","authors":["Emmanuel Bernuau","Emmanuel Moulay","Patrick Coirault"],"meta":["September 2019Automatica 107:467-473","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2019.06.013"],"references":["320347815_Stability_of_homogeneous_nonlinear_systems_with_sampled-data_inputs","274285377_On_the_stability_of_input-affine_nonlinear_systems_with_sampled-data_control","326613602_Stability_analysis_of_systems_with_aperiodic_sample-and-hold_devices","315667100_Homogeneous_High_Order_Sliding_Mode_design_A_Lyapunov_approach","311528698_Recent_developments_on_the_stability_of_systems_with_aperiodic_sampling_An_overview","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284024684_Stability_of_networked_control_systems","281533662_Robustness_and_stability_of_nonlinear_systems_a_homogeneous_point_of_view","269292498_Networked_Control_Systems_A_time-delay_approach","267150010_Discontinuous_Systems-Lyapunov_Analysis_and_Robust_Synthesis_Under_Uncertainty_Conditions"]}
