{"id":"226921079_The_interval_Branch_Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_with_Inexact_Distances","abstract":"The Distance Geometry Problem in three dimensions consists in finding an embedding in \n\n\\mathbbR3{\\mathbb{R}^3} of a given nonnegatively weighted simple undirected graph such that edge weights are equal to the corresponding Euclidean\ndistances in the embedding. This is a continuous search problem that can be discretized under some assumptions on the minimum\ndegree of the vertices. In this paper we discuss the case where we consider the full-atom representation of the protein backbone\nand some of the edge weights are subject to uncertainty within a given nonnegative interval. We show that a discretization\nis still possible and propose the iBP algorithm to solve the problem. The approach is validated by some computational experiments on a set of artificially generated\ninstances.\n\nKeywordsDistance geometry–Protein conformations–NMR data–Combinatorial optimization–Interval Branch and Prune","authors":["Carlile Lavor","Leo Liberti","Antonio Mucherino"],"meta":["January 2012Journal of Global Optimization 56(3):1-17","DOI:10.1007/s10898-011-9799-6"],"references":["257121292_Semidefinite_Facial_Reduction_for_Low-Rank_Euclidean_Distance_Matrix_Completion","245973187_Double_VNS_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","244235393_Grover's_Algorithm_applied_to_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","289240516_Theory_of_semidefinite_programming_for_sensor_network_localization","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","266702032_DIMACS_Seties_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Theoretical_Computer_Science_V_23_Global_Minimization_of_Nonconvex_Energy_Functions_Molecular_Conformation_and_Protein_Folding","266367010_A_Tabu_Based_Pattern_Search_Method_for_the_Distance_Geometry_Problem","264465058_A_Branch-and-Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","245921920_Die_Graphische_Statik_der_Starren_Systeme","244494568_Reliable_computation_of_the_points_of_intersection_of_n_spheres_in_R_n"]}
