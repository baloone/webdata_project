{"id":"342006212_Reducing_the_number_of_unnecessary_biopsies_of_US-BI-RADS_4a_lesions_through_a_deep_learning_method_for_residents-in-training_a_cross-sectional_study","abstract":"Objective\nThe aim of the study is to explore the potential value of S-Detect for residents-in-training, a computer-assisted diagnosis system based on deep learning (DL) algorithm.\n\nMethods\nThe study was designed as a cross-sectional study. Routine breast ultrasound examinations were conducted by an experienced radiologist. The ultrasonic images of the lesions were retrospectively assessed by five residents-in-training according to the Breast Imaging Report and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon, and a dichotomic classification of the lesions was provided by S-Detect. The diagnostic performances of S-Detect and the five residents were measured and compared using the pathological results as the gold standard. The category 4a lesions assessed by the residents were downgraded to possibly benign as classified by S-Detect. The diagnostic performance of the integrated results was compared with the original results of the residents.\n\nParticipants\nA total of 195 focal breast lesions were consecutively enrolled, including 82 malignant lesions and 113 benign lesions.\n\nResults\nS-Detect presented higher specificity (77.88%) and area under the curve (AUC) (0.82) than the residents (specificity: 19.47%–48.67%, AUC: 0.62–0.74). A total of 24, 31, 38, 32 and 42 identified as BI-RADS 4a lesions by residents 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were downgraded to possibly benign lesions by S-Detect, respectively. Among these downgraded lesions, 24, 28, 35, 30 and 40 lesions were proven to be pathologically benign, respectively. After combining the residents' results with the results of the software in category 4a lesions, the specificity and AUC of the five residents significantly improved (specificity: 46.02%–76.11%, AUC: 0.71–0.85, p<0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient of the five residents also increased after integration (from 0.480 to 0.643).\n\nConclusions\nWith the help of the DL software, the specificity, overall diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement of the residents greatly improved. The software can be used as adjunctive tool for residents-in-training, downgrading 4a lesions to possibly benign and reducing unnecessary biopsies.","authors":["Chenyang Zhao","Mengsu Xiao","He Liu","Ming Wang"],"meta":["June 2020BMJ Open 10(6):e035757","DOI:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035757"],"references":["324682444_Automated_classification_of_focal_breast_lesions_according_to_S-detect_validation_and_role_as_a_clinical_and_teaching_tool","324595451_Comparison_of_strain_and_shear_wave_elastography_for_qualitative_and_quantitative_assessment_of_breast_masses_in_the_same_population","320635758_Ultrasound_Imaging_Technologies_for_Breast_Cancer_Detection_and_Management_A_Review","319110267_Application_of_computer-aided_diagnosis_in_breast_ultrasound_interpretation_Improvement_in_diagnostic_performances_according_to_reader_experience","318972455_Automated_Breast_Ultrasound_Lesions_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","335437426_Breast_Cancer_Statistics_Recent_Trends","325715101_Role_of_elastography_for_downgrading_BI-RADS_category_4a_breast_lesions_according_to_risk_factors","323945188_Focal_breast_lesion_characterization_according_to_the_BI-RADS_US_lexicon_role_of_a_computer-aided_decision-making_support","321661366_Classification_of_breast_cancer_from_ultrasound_Imaging_using_a_generic_deep_learning_Analysis_Software_a_pilot_study","318833956_Application_of_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_on_Breast_Ultrasonography_Evaluation_of_Diagnostic_Performances_and_Agreement_of_Radiologists_According_to_Different_Levels_of_Experience"]}
