{"id":"222874373_A_new_method_for_solving_the_problems_of_the_stationary_kinetics_of_enzymological_reactions","abstract":"A new method is proposed for solving problems of the stationary kinetics of enzymological reactions. The topological theory of graphs, which has been applied to information theory and to the theory of electrical networks etc., isapplied for the first time to biochemical kinetics. The method is illustrated by the solving of simple problemsâ€”competitive and non-competitive inhibition and the cooperative interaction of two active sites. A comparison of the method with that of King and Altman5 shows the advantages of the new algorythm.","authors":["M.V. Volkenstein","B.N.
