{"id":"339071598_A_novel_one-dimensional_sine_powered_chaotic_map_and_its_application_in_a_new_image_encryption_scheme","abstract":"With the rapid growth of data transmission technology, image encryption is becoming a widely discussed topic in the field of information security. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-dimensional sine powered chaotic system (1DSP). Evaluation of the proposed chaotic system indicates the existence of chaotic behavior with high sensitivity and randomness. We further present a new image encryption scheme using 1DSP (1DSP-IE). The proposed scheme uses the 1DSP for sequence addition to improve its security. Furthermore, row-by-row and column-by-column concepts are used for confusion and diffusion operations. This approach breaks the correlation of adjacent pixels by scrambling pixels out of their original rows and columns and applies bit-level pixel value manipulation for each row and then each column to spread any change in the plain image throughout the ciphered image. The simulation results of the proposed 1DSP-IE indicate an effective encryption and decryption process with good speed. In addition, the security analysis illustrates the ability of 1DSP-IE to provide a satisfying level of security in comparison with other image encryption schemes.","authors":["Ali Mansouri","Xingyuan Wang"],"meta":["February 2020Information Sciences 520","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2020.02.008","Project: Chaos-Based Encryption System"],"references":["330078270_Image_Encryption_Using_Josephus_Problem_and_Filtering_Diffusion","329876077_Cosine-Transform-Based_Chaotic_System_for_Image_Encryption","320401448_Improvement_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Algorithm_With_Shift_Row_and_SBox_Modification_Mapping_in_Mix_Column","310494248_Differential_cryptanalysis_of_a_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos_and_Line_map","298787843_The_0-1_Test_for_Chaos_A_Review","274012098_Chosen-plaintext_attack_of_an_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_modified_permutation-diffusion_structure","271659293_Cryptanalyzing_image_encryption_using_chaotic_logistic_map","237005499_Simple_Mathematical_Models_With_Very_Complicated_Dynamics","220272513_Some_Basic_Cryptographic_Requirements_for_Chaos-Based_Cryptosystems","12474276_Physiological_Time-Series_Analysis_Using_Approximate_Entropy_and_Sample_Entropy","338302764_Image_encryption_scheme_by_combining_the_hyper-chaotic_system_with_quantum_coding","337659583_An_encryption_system_for_color_image_based_on_compressive_sensing","336548244_2D_Hybrid_chaos_map_for_image_security_transform_based_on_framelet_and_cellular_automata","336244846_Binary_Search_Tree_Image_encryption_with_DNA","336184244_When_an_attacker_meets_a_cipher-image_in_2018_A_year_in_review","335501611_A_Novel_Chaos_Based_Optical_Image_Encryption_Using_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_DNA_Sequence_Operation","335212164_Image_encryption_algorithm_for_synchronously_updating_Boolean_networks_based_on_matrix_semi-tensor_product_theory","332580326_Effective_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Image_with_Adaptive_Encoding_Strategy","332151136_Adaptive_Control_for_Fractional_Order_Induced_Chaotic_Fuzzy_Cellular_Neural_Networks_and_Its_Application_to_Image_Encryption","331979656_An_efficient_spatiotemporal_chaotic_image_cipher_with_an_improved_scrambling_algorithm_driven_by_dynamic_diffusion_phase","331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","323997625_The_unified_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos_and_cubic_S-Box","323827708_2D_Logistic-Sine-Coupling_Map_for_Image_Encryption","322848980_Integrated_Chaotic_Systems_for_Image_Encryption","320829204_Role_of_NPCR_and_UACI_tests_in_security_problems_of_chaos_based_image_encryption_algorithms_and_possible_solution_proposals","319401178_A_novel_bit-level_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_2D-LICM_hyperchaotic_map","316368700_Data_Encryption_Standard_DES","316153773_An_efficient_symmetric_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_an_intertwining_logistic_map","313924679_Cross-utilizing_hyperchaotic_and_DNA_sequences_for_image_encryption","313835341_Design_of_image_cipher_using_block-based_scrambling_and_image_filtering","311162648_A_simple_yet_efficient_S-box_method_based_chaotic_sine_map","305336327_N-phase_Logistic_chaotic_sequence_and_its_application_for_image_encryption","301273723_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_map","293195955_Novel_Quantum_image_encryption_using_one-dimensional_quantum_cellular_automata","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","284880333_NPCR_and_UACI_randomness_tests_for_image_encryption","283872004_A_novel_bit-level_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_maps","276241284_A_fast_image_algorithm_based_on_rows_and_columns_switch","273475640_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_3D_cellular_automata_and_chaotic_maps","272028181_Image_compression_and_encryption_scheme_based_on_2D_compressive_sensing_and_fractional_Mellin_transform","268822562_2D_Sine_Logistic_modulation_map_for_image_encryption","260032019_A_novel_blind_robust_image_watermarking_in_DCT_domain_using_inter-block_coefficient_correlation","256994174_Image_encryption_using_a_new_parametric_switching_chaotic_system","256721123_Local_Shanon_Entropy_Measure_with_Statistical_Tests_for_Image_Randomness","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","222458428_A_Practical_Method_for_Calculating_Largest_Lyapunov_Exponents_From_Small_Data_Set"]}
