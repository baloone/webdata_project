{"id":"282905875_The_Diagonal_Lemma_Fails_in_Aristotelian_Logic","abstract":"In the 1950-ies P. F. Strawson proposed the Logic of Presuppositions. In this\nsystem sentences with empty subject are considered neither true nor false.\nStrawson considered only simple sentences with two predicate letters. But the\nconcept can be extended to arbitrary monadic, even polyadic sentences utilizing\ntruth-relevant logic developed by Richard Diaz. It can be shown that\nself-referential G\\\"odel's sentence in fact has an empty subject, and can thus\nbe classified by the Logic of Presuppositions as neither true nor false.","authors":["Xaver Newberry"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311719708_Introduction_to_Logical_Theory","239028838_Topics_in_the_Logic_of_Relevance"]}
