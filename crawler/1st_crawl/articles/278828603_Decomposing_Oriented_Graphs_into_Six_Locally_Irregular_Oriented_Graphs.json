{"id":"278828603_Decomposing_Oriented_Graphs_into_Six_Locally_Irregular_Oriented_Graphs","abstract":"An undirected graph G is locally irregular if every two of its adjacent vertices have distinct degrees. We say that G is decomposable into k locally irregular graphs if there exists a partition E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup ... \\cup E_k of the edge set E(G) such that each E_i induces a locally irregular graph. It was recently conjectured by Baudon et al. that every undirected graph admits a decomposition into 3 locally irregular graphs, except for a well-characterized set of indecomposable graphs. We herein consider an oriented version of this conjecture. Namely, can every oriented graph be decomposed into 3 locally irregular oriented graphs, i.e. whose adjacent vertices have distinct outdegrees? We start by supporting this conjecture by verifying it for several classes of oriented graphs. We then prove a weaker version of this conjecture. Namely, we prove that every oriented graph can be decomposed into 6 locally irregular oriented graphs. We finally prove that even if our conjecture were true, it would remain NP-complete to decide whether an oriented graph is decomposable into 2 locally irregular oriented graphs.","authors":["Julien Bensmail","Gabriel Renault"],"meta":["September 2016Graphs and Combinatorics 32(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-016-1705-z"],"references":["238068947_How_to_Define_an_Irregular_Graph","322812965_How_to_Define_an_Irregular_Graph","291265768_Extremal_Graph_Theory","275059329_On_decomposing_regular_graphs_into_locally_irregular_subgraphs","273798010_Graph_Theory","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","235602123_Product_Graphs_Structure_and_Recognition","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
