{"id":"340067197_Use_of_the_flipped_classroom_to_design_creative_and_active_activities_in_the_field_of_computer_science","abstract":"The objective of this quantitative research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the educational process on computer science considering data science and machine learning. This study proposes the consultation of YouTube videos (before class), collaborative work through MySQL software (during class) and individual work through MySQL software (after class) in the database subject. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that school activities before, during and after the class positively influence the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills on the administration of the database. Likewise, data science identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom in the educational process by means of the decision tree technique. Finally, the flipped classroom improves the teaching-learning conditions through the performance of creative and active activities.","authors":["Ricardo Ad√°n Salas Rueda"],"meta":["March 2020Creativity Studies 13(1):136-151","DOI:10.3846/cs.2020.10336"],"references":["331361424_University_students'_selfperception_on_the_use_of_digital_technologies_for_learning","331360720_Implementation_of_Flipped_Classroom_in_a_propaedeutic_course_of_mathematical_skill_in_high_school","329532033_Diseno_e_integracion_del_recurso_multimedia_Mine-ducation_en_educacion_primaria_Valoraciones_aportadas_por_expertos","329231529_Aprendizaje_situado_en_el_diseno_de_entornos_virtuales_de_aprendizaje_una_experiencia_de_aprendizaje_entre_pares_en_una_comunidad_de_practica","327270207_Estudiantes_Universitarios_prosumidores_de_recursos_digitales_y_mediaticos_en_la_era_de_Internet","331585221_Learning_through_mobile_devices_Leveraging_affordances_as_facilitators_of_engagement","331369095_Do_they_know_everything_Educational_innovations_aimed_at_promoting_digital_skills_in_university_students","327761949_Is_Technology_the_Answer_Investigating_Students'_Engagement_in_Math","325563807_Flipping_the_classroom_for_information_literacy_instruction","325563204_Using_a_flipped_classroom_to_embed_information_literacy_skills_training_into_academic_studies"]}
