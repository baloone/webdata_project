{"id":"282221736_Informatics_Olympiads_in_Turkey_Team_Selection_and_Training","abstract":"In this country report, we present the yearly activities related to Turkish team selection and training for national and international olympiads in informatics. First, we outline the organizational structure and describe the scientific and administrative components. We, then, describe the several stages of team selection, which start with a nationwide written test administered in selected cities in Turkey. Each stage is followed by two week long training camps. In these camps, students are taught the IOI curriculum and they engage in programming competition practices. In this report, we give the details of curriculum organization and test preparation. We conclude with medal statistics covering the last 22 years of the Turkish IOI team.","authors":["Tolga Can","İbrahim Onur Sığırcı","Osman Abul","M.
