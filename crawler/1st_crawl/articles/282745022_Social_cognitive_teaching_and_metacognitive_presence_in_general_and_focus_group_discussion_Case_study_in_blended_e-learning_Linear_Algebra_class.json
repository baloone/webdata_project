The challenges faced in teaching Linear Algebra at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia are that students are freshmen who are used to being dependent learners; and there is a time restriction to face-to-face interaction, while this course requires high interaction between students and instructor. To enhance communication beyond the classroom, we have implemented a blended-mode in the teaching-learning process (face-to-face and online learning). For the purpose of the study, two types of discussion were utilized: general (class) discussion and focus-group discussion forums. This study used message as the unit of analysis. We found that students tend to exhibit teaching presence more intense in small focus-group discussion than in general forum. It is also interesting to note that the students regulated their cognition more in focus-group forum than in the general one.","authors":["Kasiyah Junus","Lia Sadita","Heru Suhartanto"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/FIE.2014.7044247"],"references":["289963462_Learning_to_think_mathematically_Problem_solving_metacognition_and_sense_making_in_mathematics","285177901_A_Constructivist_Approach_to_Online_Learning_The_Community_of_Inquiry_Framework","279541560_Student_role_adjustment_in_online_communities_of_inquiry_Model_and_instrument_validation","257496491_Toward_the_development_of_a_metacognition_construct_for_communities_of_inquiry","245816834_Critical_Thinking_Cognitive_Presence_and_Computer_Conferencing_in_Distance_Education","228718399_Student_role_adjustment_in_online_communities_of_inquiry_Model_and_instrument_validation","225130374_Magno_C_The_role_of_metacognitive_skills_in_developing_critical_thinking_Metacogn_Learn_52_137-156","222579109_Revisiting_methodological_issues_in_transcript_analysis_Negotiated_coding_and_reliability","222474115_Critical_Inquiry_in_a_Text-Based_Environment_Computer_Conferencing_in_Higher_Education","222118442_The_first_decade_of_the_community_of_inquiry_framework_A_retrospective","215774114_Supersizing_e-learning_What_a_CoI_survey_reveals_about_teaching_presence_in_a_large_online_class","32229593_Methodological_Issues_in_the_Content_Analysis_of_Computer_Conference_Transcripts","284699289_Learning_in_communities_of_inquiry_A_review_of_the_literature","222182592_Assessing_metacognition_in_an_online_Community_of_Inquiry","221423089_The_Use_of_E-Learning_towards_New_Learning_Paradigm_Case_Study_Student_Centered_E-Learning_Environment_at_Faculty_of_Computer_Science-University_of_Indonesia"]}
