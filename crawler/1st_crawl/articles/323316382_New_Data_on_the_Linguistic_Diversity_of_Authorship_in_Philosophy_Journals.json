{"id":"323316382_New_Data_on_the_Linguistic_Diversity_of_Authorship_in_Philosophy_Journals","abstract":"This paper investigates the representation of authors with different linguistic backgrounds in academic publishing. We first review some common rebuttals of concerns about linguistic injustice. We then analyze 1039 authors of philosophy journals, primarily selected from the 2015 Leiter Report. While our data show that Anglophones dominate the output of philosophy papers, this unequal distribution cannot be solely attributed to language capacities. We also discover that ethics journals have more Anglophone authors than logic journals and that most authors (73.40%) are affiliated with English-speaking universities, suggesting other factors (e.g. philosophical areas and academic resources) may also play significant roles. Moreover, some interesting results are revealed when we combine the factor of sex with place of affiliation and linguistic background. It indicates that while certain linguistic injustice is inevitable in academic publishing, it may be more complex than thought. We next introduce Broadbent’s (Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci 40:302–311, 2009a, Legal Theory 15:173–191, 2009b, Philos Stud 158(3):457–476, 2012, Philosophy of epidemiology, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2013, Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci 48:250–257, 2014) contrastive account of causation to give a causal explanation of our findings. Broadbent’s account not only well characterizes the multifaceted causality in academic publishing but also provides a methodological guideline for further investigation.","authors":["Chun-Ping Yen","Tzu-Wei Hung"],"meta":["August 2019Erkenntnis 84(7)","DOI:10.1007/s10670-018-9989-4"],"references":["320755347_Globalized_Parochialism_Consequences_of_English_As_Lingua_Franca_in_Philosophy_of_Science","317758234_New_data_on_the_representation_of_women_in_philosophy_journals_2004-2015","344860205_The_Environment_and_Disease_Association_or_Causation","344133471_Linguistic_Justice_for_Europe_and_for_the_World","344045872_Guardians_of_Science_Fairness_and_Reliability_of_Peer_Review","331241838_Linguistic_Justice_for_Europe_Belgium_and_the_World","316794108_Philosophy_of_Epidemiology","313757386_The_environment_and_disease_Association_or_causation","312318181_Writing_academic_english_as_a_doctoral_student_in_sweden_narrative_perspectives","310757850_Two_principles_of_equal_language_recognition","308751006_Publish_in_English_or_perish_The_effect_on_citation_rate_of_using_languages_other_than_English_in_scientific_publications","304428630_How_Inclusive_Is_European_Philosophy_of_Science","309184908_Language_myths_and_publishing_mysteries_A_response_to_Politzer-Ahles_et_al","308947267_Is_linguistic_injustice_a_myth_A_response_to_Hyland_2016","295813424_English_as_the_international_language_of_science_A_case_study_of_Mexican_scientists'_academic_writing_for_publication"]}
