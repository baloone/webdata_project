{"id":"263063836_Engineering_Design_Thinking_Teaching_and_Learning","abstract":"This paper is based on the premises that the purpose of\nengineering education is to graduate engineers who can design,\nand that design thinking is complex. The paper begins by briefly\nreviewing the history and role of design in the engineering\ncurriculum. Several dimensions of design thinking are then\ndetailed, explaining why design is hard to learn and harder still to\nteach, and outlining the research available on how well design\nthinking skills are learned. The currently most-favored\npedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning\n(PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on\nits success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized: first-year\ncornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses. Finally,\nthe paper lists some of the open research questions that must be\nanswered to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving\ndesign learning, after which it closes by making recommendations\nfor research aimed at enhancing design learning.","authors":["Clive L.
