{"id":"220659724_Learning_Probabilistic_Models_for_Contour_Completion_in_Natural_Images","abstract":"Using a large set of human segmented natural images, we study the statistics of region boundaries. We observe several power law distributions which likely arise from both multi-scale structure within individual objects and from arbitrary viewing distance. Accordingly, we de- velop a scale-invariant representation of images from the bottom up, using a piecewise linear approximation of con- tours and constrained Delaunay triangulation to complete gaps. We model curvilinear grouping on top of this graph- ical/geometric structure using a conditional random field to capture the statistics of continuity and different junc- tion types. Quantitative evaluations on several large datasets show that our contour grouping algorithm consistently dom- inates and significantly improves on local edge detection.","authors":["Xiaofeng Ren","Charless C.
