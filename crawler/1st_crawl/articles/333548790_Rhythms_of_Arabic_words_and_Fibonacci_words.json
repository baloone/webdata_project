{"id":"333548790_Rhythms_of_Arabic_words_and_Fibonacci_words","abstract":"As part of a research project in computer science on the realization of a cryptographic system using Arabic poems as secret keys (Azizi, 2012), we defined the formal structure of the rhythms of Arabic words. These rhythms, as they were studied by Al Khalil Al Farahidi (), are the sequences of movement and silence, which take into account only the pronounced letters. The metric prosody of the Arabic language was designed by its founders in a fundamentally quantitative way. We will demonstrate in this paper that the rhythms of Arabic words are variants of Fibonacci words.","authors":["Imad-Eddine Benkoudad","Abdelmalek Azizi","Mohammed El AMRANI el Amrani"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences 33(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.jksuci.2019.05.008"],"references":["275700134_L'Arabe_classique_Esquisse_d'une_structure_linguistique","235679622_Java_cryptographycal_application_based_on_Arabic_poetry","222021868_The_so-called_fibonacci_numbers_in_ancient_and_medieval_India"]}
