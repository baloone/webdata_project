{"id":"331777104_Automating_multimodal_microscopy_with_NanoJ-Fluidics","abstract":"Combining and multiplexing microscopy approaches is crucial to understand cellular events, but requires elaborate workflows. Here, we present a robust, open-source approach for treating, labelling and imaging live or fixed cells in automated sequences. NanoJ-Fluidics is based on low-cost Lego hardware controlled by ImageJ-based software, making high-content, multimodal imaging easy to implement on any microscope with high reproducibility. We demonstrate its capacity on event-driven, super-resolved live-to-fixed and multiplexed STORM/DNA-PAINT experiments.","authors":["Pedro Almada","Pedro Matos Pereira","Si√¢n Culley","Ghislaine Caillol"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Communications 10(1):1223","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-09231-9"],"references":["330692066_NanoJ_A_high-performance_open-source_super-resolution_microscopy_toolbox","323273060_Quantitative_mapping_and_minimization_of_super-resolution_optical_imaging_artifacts","320722555_Localization-based_super-resolution_imaging_meets_high-content_screening","313124239_DNA-barcoded_labeling_probes_for_highly_multiplexed_Exchange-PAINT_imaging","308926783_madSTORM_a_Super-Resolution_Technique_for_Large-Scale_Multiplexing_at_Single_Molecule_Accuracy","306085616_Fast_live-cell_conventional_fluorophore_nanoscopy_with_ImageJ_through_super-resolution_radial_fluctuations","326830387_Multiplexed_protein_maps_link_subcellular_organization_to_cellular_state","324384324_The_Role_of_Mitotic_Cell-Substrate_Adhesion_Re-modeling_in_Animal_Cell_Division","317749276_Super-resolution_microscopy_with_DNA-PAINT","312052379_Correlative_Super-Resolution_Microscopy_New_Dimensions_and_New_Opportunities","304785738_VirusMapper_Open-source_nanoscale_mapping_of_viral_architecture_through_super-resolution_microscopy","304777389_PFA_fixation_enables_artifact-free_super-resolution_imaging_of_the_actin_cytoskeleton_and_associated_proteins","288817917_Nanoscale_Architecture_of_the_Axon_Initial_Segment_Reveals_an_Organized_and_Robust_Scaffold","279863890_Erratum_Multitarget_super-resolution_microscopy_with_high-density_labeling_by_exchangeable_probes","304610258_Coupling_changes_in_cell_shape_to_chromosome_segregation"]}
