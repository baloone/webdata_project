{"id":"307741638_A_New_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_Business_Intelligence_Recommender_System","abstract":"Business Intelligence is a set of methods, process and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful \nand useful information. Recommender system is one of business intelligence system that is used to obtain \nknowledge to the active user for better decision making. Recommender systems apply data mining \ntechniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information. Due to the growth in \nthe number of information and the users in recent years offers challenges in recommender systems. \nCollaborative, content, demographic and knowledge-based are four different types of recommendations \nsystems. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed for recommender system which combines \nknowledge based, profile of the users and most frequent item mining technique to obtain intelligence.","authors":["P.
