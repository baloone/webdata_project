{"id":"342892095_Bogdanov-Takens_Bifurcation_in_a_Neutral_Delayed_Hopfield_Neural_Network_with_Bidirectional_Connection","abstract":"In this paper, a neutral Hopfield neural network with bidirectional connection is considered. In the first step, by choosing the connection weights as parameters bifurcation, the critical point at which a zero root of multiplicity two occurs in the characteristic equation associated with the linearized system. In the second step, we studied the zeros of a third degree exponential polynomial in order to make sure that except the double zero root, all the other roots of the characteristic equation have real parts that are negative. Moreover, we find the critical values to guarantee the existence of the Bogdanovâ€“Takens bifurcation. In the third step, the normal form is obtained and its dynamical behaviors are studied after the use of the reduction on the center manifold and the theory of the normal form. Furthermore, for the demonstration of our results, we have given a numerical example.","authors":["Houssem Achouri","Chaouki Aouiti","Bassem Ben Hamed"],"meta":["July 2020International Journal of Biomathematics 13(252):2050049","DOI:10.1142/S1793524520500497","Project: Bifurcations analysis of dynamical system"],"references":["331667620_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Synchronization_of_Inertial_Cohen-Grossberg-Type_Neural_Networks_with_Time_Varying_Delays","328812163_Stability_Analysis_for_a_Class_of_Impulsive_Bidirectional_Associative_Memory_BAM_Neural_Networks_with_Distributed_Delays_and_Leakage_Time-Varying_Delays","328518104_A_New_LMI_Approach_to_Finite_and_Fixed_Time_Stabilization_of_High-Order_Class_of_BAM_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays","326343913_New_Results_on_Impulsive_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks","326225870_Stability_analysis_for_a_class_of_impulsive_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_leakage_time-varying_delays","323672016_Piecewise_asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_impulsive_non-autonomous_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","307613765_Neutral_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_coefficients_and_leakage_delays","307598314_Oscillation_of_impulsive_neutral_delay_generalized_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks","267482653_Bogdanov-Takens_bifurcation_for_neutral_functional_differential_equations","261712910_On_the_zeros_of_transcendental_functions_with_applications_to_stability_of_delay_differential_equations_with_two_delays","223829302_Normal_Forms_for_Retarded_Functional_Differential_Equations_and_Applications_to_Bogdanov-Takens_Singularity","40686117_Evolutionary_dynamics_in_structured_populations","16609657_Neurons_With_Graded_Response_Have_Collective_Computational_Properties_Like_Those_of_Two-State_Neurons","9021259_An_adjustable_aperiodic_model_class_of_genomic_interactions_using_continuous_time_Boolean_networks_Boolean_delay_equations","3302880_Stability_of_asymmetric_Hopfield_networks","3301875_Delay-independent_stability_in_bidirection_associative_memory_networks","334701517_Nonlinear_Lipschitz_measure_and_adaptive_control_for_stability_and_synchronization_in_delayed_inertial_Cohen-Grossberg-type_neural_networks","333004227_Existence_and_Exponential_Stability_of_Piecewise_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_of_Neutral-type_Inertial_Neural_Networks_with_Mixed_delay_and_Impulsive_Perturbations","330641888_Dynamics_of_impulsive_neutral-type_BAM_neural_networks","326069247_Finite_Time_Stabilization_of_Uncertain_Delayed_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_a_Time-varying_Leakage_Delay_via_Non-Chattering_Control","318857961_Bogdanov-Takens_bifurcation_in_a_neutral_BAM_neural_networks_model_with_delays","295395539_Hopf_bifurcation_for_neutral-type_neural_network_model_with_two_delays","282633399_Global_exponential_stability_in_Lagrange_sense_for_inertial_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","281892921_Bogdanov-Takens_bifurcation_in_a_Hopfield_network_model_with_bidirectional_connection_and_multiple_delays","275367660_Heteroclinic_Networks_in_Homogeneous_and_Heterogeneous_Identical_Cell_Systems","267669717_Normal_Forms_and_Bifurcation_of_Planar_Vector_Fields","266066455_The_existence_of_positive_solutions_of_neutral_differential_equations","265170621_Stability_and_global_Hopf_bifurcation_for_neutral_BAM_neural_network","257634048_Bogdanov-Takens_bifurcation_in_a_tri-neuron_BAM_neural_network_model_with_multiple_delays","257590812_Dynamics_of_a_congestion_control_model_in_a_wireless_access_network","257191264_New_delay-dependent_stability_criteria_for_neural_networks_with_time-varying_interval_delay","243541542_Improved_results_on_stability_analysis_of_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_Novel_delay-dependent_criteria","242999217_Bifurcation_analysis_in_a_simplified_tri-neuron_BAM_network_model_with_multiple_delays","242956811_Versal_Deformations_of_a_Singular_Point_on_the_Plane_in_the_Case_of_Zero_Eigenvalues","238855200_S1-degree_and_global_Hopf_bifurcation_theory_of_functional_differential_equations","232368138_Homoclinic_orbits_and_Hopf_bifurcations_in_delay_differential_systems_with_T-B_singularity","226777211_Dynamics_of_an_inertial_two-neuron_system_with_time_delay","225778674_Singularities_of_vector_fields","224043418_Versal_deformations_of_a_singular_point_on_the_plan_in_the_case_of_zero_eigenvalues","223661966_On_Neutral_Functional-Differential_Equations_with_Proportional_Delays","222627189_Global_stability_of_bidirectional_associative_memory_neural_networks_with_distributed_delays","11253287_Zou_XF_Exponential_Stability_of_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks_Neural_Networks_15_415-422","8945888_Global_asymptotic_stability_of_Hopfield_neural_network_involving_distributed_delays","7060930_Stability_analysis_for_stochastic_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_mixed_time_delays"]}
