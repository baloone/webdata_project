{"id":"319203540_A_Formal_Proof_in_Coq_of_LaSalle's_Invariance_Principle","abstract":"Stability analysis of dynamical systems plays an important role in the study of control techniques. LaSalleâ€™s invariance principle is a result about the asymptotic stability of the solutions to a nonlinear system of differential equations and several extensions of this principle have been designed to fit different particular kinds of system. In this paper we present a formalization, in the Coq proof assistant, of a slightly improved version of the original principle. This is a step towards a formal verification of dynamical systems.","authors":["Cyril Cohen","Damien Rouhling"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66107-0_10","Conference: International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving"],"references":["262332132_Type_Classes_and_Filters_for_Mathematical_Analysis_in_IsabelleHOL","260662046_LaSalle-Yoshizawa_Corollaries_for_Nonsmooth_Systems","284688895_Formal_proof_-_The_four-color_theorem","278645307_Interaction_between_linear_algebra_and_analysis_in_formal_mathematics","271573415_Coquelicot_A_User-Friendly_Library_of_Real_Analysis_for_Coq","270150399_Topology_for_Analysis","267472110_Interactive_Theorem_Proving_-_4th_International_Conference_ITP_2013_Rennes_France_July_22-26_2013_Proceedings","265983170_Topology_for_Analysis","265372488_Probleme_general_de_la_stabilite_du_mouvement_Traduit_du_russe_par_M_Edouard_Davaux","262213108_PVS_Linear_Algebra_Libraries_for_Verification_of_Control_Software_Algorithms_in_CACSL"]}
