{"id":"301579670_Fluid_Limits_for_Multiple-Input_Shortest_Remaining_Processing_Time_Queues","abstract":"A single queueing station serving K input streams with renewal arrivals and generally distributed independent and identically distributed service times is considered. Customers are served by the Shortest Remaining Processing Time policy. In the case of a tie, the first-in, first-out policy is utilized. We analyze a fluid model for the evolution of a measure-valued state descriptor of this system, with particular emphasis on its limiting behavior in the critical case as time gets large. We also prove a fluid limit theorem justifying our fluid model as the first-order approximation of the queueing system under consideration. Along the way, we establish fluid limits for the corresponding state-dependent response times.","authors":["Łukasz Kruk","Ewa Sokołowska"],"meta":["April 2016Mathematics of Operations Research 41(3)","DOI:10.1287/moor.2015.0768"],"references":["220462421_Queues_With_Equally_Heavy_Sojourn_Time_and_Service_Requirement_Distributions","2119922_A_large-deviations_analysis_of_the_GIGI1_SRPT_queue","292799109_Heavy_traffic_in_a_system_with_a_discipline_of_priority_servicing_for_the_job_of_shortest_remaining_length_with_interruption","230663954_Weak_Convergence_and_Empirical_Process","226414491_Diffusion_approximations_for_open_multiclass_queueing_networks_Sufficient_conditions_involving_state_space_collapse","220084779_Multi-layered_round_robin_routing_for_parallel_servers","220084003_State_space_collapse_with_application_to_heavy_traffic_limits_for_multiclass_queueing_networks","220083921_Convergence_to_Equilibria_for_Fluid_Models_of_FIFO_Queueing_Networks","220083881_Stability_of_Earliest-Due-Date_First-Served_Queueing_Networks"]}
