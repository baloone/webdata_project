{"id":"221324326_Mining_Bluetooth_Attacks_in_Smart_Phones","abstract":"The Bluetooth port of the Smart Phones is subject to threat of attacks of Bluesnarfing, Bluejacking and Bluebugging. In this paper, we aim to deal with mining these attacks. Having explained properties of the three attack types, we state three typical cases of them including SMS manipulation, phone book manipulation, and phone call initiation. According to characteristics of each attack type, we model the attacks by using Colored Petri-Nets and then mine the models. To show correctness of our models, we verify their liveness, fairness, and boundness properties. Finally, we mine models to analyze attacks.","authors":["Seyed Morteza Babamir","Reyhaneh Nowrouzi","Hadi Naseri"],"meta":["July 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-14292-5_26","SourceDBLP","Conference: Networked Digital Technologies - Second International Conference, NDT 2010, Prague, Czech Republic, July 7-9, 2010.
