{"id":"260489865_Foreign_exchange_market_as_a_lattice_gauge_theory","abstract":"A simple model of the foreign exchange market is exactly a lattice gauge\ntheory. Exchange rates are the exponentials of gauge potentials defined\non spatial links while interest rates are related to gauge potentials on\ntemporal links. Arbitrage opportunities are given by nonzero values of\nthe gauge-invariant field tensor or curvature defined on closed loops.\nArbitrage opportunities involving cross-rates at one time are ``magnetic\nfields,'' while arbitrage opportunities involving future contracts are\n``electric fields.''","authors":["Kenneth Young"],"meta":["October 1999American Journal of Physics 67(10):862-868","DOI:10.1119/1.19139"],"references":["313530494_Confinement_of_quarks","265669807_The_Fokker-Planck_equation_Methods_of_solution_and_applications_2nd_ed","264908423_Lattice_gauge_theories_An_introduction_2nd_ed","260890557_The_Physics_of_High_Finance","253542507_Conservation_of_Isotopic_Spin_and_Isotopic_Gauge_Invariance","253524705_Revitalizing_Undergraduate_Physics_Programs_Who_Needs_It","253095855_Guest_Comment_Revitalizing_undergraduate_physics-Who_needs_it","252824229_Dirac_P_A_M_Quantised_singularities_in_the_electromagnetic_field_Proc_R_Soc_A_133_60-72","248224348_Unity_of_All_Elementary-Particle_Force","248198519_Ultraviolet_Behavior_of_Non-Abelian_Gauge_Theories"]}
