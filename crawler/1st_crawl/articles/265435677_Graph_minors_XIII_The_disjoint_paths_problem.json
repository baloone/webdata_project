{"id":"265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","abstract":"We describe an algorithm, which for fixed k â‰¥ 0 has running time O(|V(G)|3), to solve the following problem: given a graph G and k pairs of vertices of G, decide if there are k mutually vertex-disjoint paths of G joining the pairs.","authors":["Neil Robertson","P.D.
