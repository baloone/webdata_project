{"id":"301904063_PISA_2012_How_do_results_for_the_paper_and_computer_tests_compare","abstract":"The Programme for International Assessment (PISA) is an important cross-national study of 15-year olds academic achievement. Although it has traditionally been conducted using paper-and-pencil tests, the vast majority of countries will use computer-based assessment from 2015. In this paper, we consider how cross-country comparisons of children’s skills differ between paper and computer versions of the PISA mathematics test. Using data from PISA 2012, where more than 200,000 children from 32 economies completed both paper and computer versions of the mathematics assessment, we find important and interesting differences between the two sets of results. This includes a substantial drop of more than 50 PISA test points (half a standard deviation) in the average performance of children from Shanghai-China. Moreover, by considering children’s responses to particular test items, we show how differences are unlikely to be solely due to the interactive nature of certain computer test questions. The paper concludes with a discussion of what the findings imply for interpretation of PISA results in 2015 and beyond.","authors":["John Jerrim"],"meta":["May 2016Assessment in Education Principles Policy and Practice 23(4):1-24","DOI:10.1080/0969594X.2016.1147420"],"references":["256563189_Reading_linear_texts_on_paper_versus_computer_screen_Effects_on_reading_comprehension","247728689_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Testing_Mode_Effects_in_Grade_K-12_Mathematics_Tests","237527104_Case_study_of_a_computer_based_examination_system","26518730_Does_it_Matter_if_I_Take_My_Mathematics_Test_on_Computer_A_Second_Empirical_Study_of_Mode_Effects_in_NAEP","309822898_Logistic_Regression_Why_We_Cannot_Do_What_We_Think_We_Can_Do_and_What_We_Can_Do_About_It","262260181_PISA_2012_Results_What_Students_Know_and_Can_Do_-_Student_Performance_in_Mathematics_Reading_and_Science","262184467_PISA_2012_Assessment_and_Analytical_Framework_Mathematics_Reading_Science_Problem_Solving_and_Financial_Literacy","237651312_SDRT_4SDMT_4_Administration_Mode_Comparability_Study","234634051_How_Review_Options_and_Administration_Modes_Influence_Scores_on_Computerized_Vocabulary_Tests","227996645_Implications_of_changing_answers_on_objective_test_items_Journal_of_Educational_Measurement_14_9-13","28798512_On-line_Mathematics_Assessment_The_Impact_of_Mode_on_Performance_and_Question_Answering_Strategies"]}
