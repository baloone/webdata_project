{"id":"348114505_Current_machine_learning_applications_in_accounting_and_auditing","abstract":"Purpose- Machine learning is an area of computer science that learns from large amounts of data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions\nabout future events. In the accounting and auditing professions, machine learning has been increasingly used in the last few years. Therefore, this study aims to review the current machine learning applications in accounting and auditing with a concentration on Big Four companies.\n\nMethodology- In this study, the machine learning tools and platforms developed by Big Four companies are examined by conducting a\ncontent analysis.\n\nFindings- It has been identified that Big Four companies developed several machine learning tools that are used for consistent audit\ncoordination and management, fully automated audits (only in certain areas, such as cash audit), data analysis, risk assessment, and\nextracting information from documents.\n\nConclusion- To benefit from the advantages, the Big Four companies are still expanding their portfolio of machine learning projects. On the\nother hand, the ethical problems and potential risks of security and violating privacy regulations by using machine learning applications in\naccounting and auditing should also be considered. This rapid transformation in the profession also creates a need for ethical and regulatory guidance and oversight for accounting and auditing companies.","authors":["Derya Üçoğlu"],"meta":["December 2020Pressacademia 12(1):1-7","DOI:10.17261/Pressacademia.2020.1337"],"references":["346610484_Integrating_Machine_Learning_with_Human_Knowledge","338469796_The_Ethical_Implications_of_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Auditing","337468608_Detecting_Accounting_Fraud_in_Publicly_Traded_US_Firms_Using_a_Machine_Learning_Approach","325047756_A_machine_learning_model_with_human_cognitive_biases_capable_of_learning_from_small_and_biased_datasets","347840144_Machine_learning_and_data_mining_in_manufacturing","340483144_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Audit_and_Accounting_Development_Current_Trends_Opportunities_and_Threats_-_Literature_Review","335461705_Detecting_anomalies_in_financial_statements_using_machine_learning_algorithm_The_case_of_Vietnamese_listed_firms","335361860_Utilizing_Machine_Learning_Techniques_to_Reveal_VAT_Compliance_Violations_in_Accounting_Data","334314773_Impact_of_technology_in_financial_reporting_The_case_of_Amazon_Go","333250922_A_Machine_Learning-Based_Peer_Selection_Method_with_Financial_Ratios","315955305_The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Intelligence_How_Automation_is_Changing_Auditing","228084523_Forecasting_fraudulent_financial_statements_using_data_mining","266322408_Application_of_Machine_Learning_Methods_to_Risk_Assessment_of_Financial_Statement_Fraud_Evidence_from_China","223892957_Comparison_of_machine_learning_techniques_with_a_qualitative_response_model_for_auditors'_going_concern_reporting"]}
