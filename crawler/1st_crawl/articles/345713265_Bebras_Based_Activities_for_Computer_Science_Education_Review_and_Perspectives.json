{"id":"345713265_Bebras_Based_Activities_for_Computer_Science_Education_Review_and_Perspectives","abstract":"The Bebras international challenge on informatics and computational thinking (CT), targeted to pupils in primary and secondary schools, is being run in more than 50 countries yearly. Tasks used in this challenge are created by an international community that meets once a year to improve them. In addition to a large amount of work done on tasks, this community is also conducting research on different aspects of Bebras, from the study of good task criteria to analyses of the organisational structure of the community. This paper presents a review of research aiming at building activities based on Bebras material to serve computer science (CS) education. They include classroom\nactivities, workshops, games development, and design of tests to evaluate \nCT skills. The paper also presents the results of a survey conducted among the Bebras community to identify existing activities using Bebras tasks and ideas for future ones. The results are summarised as a guideline with perspectives aiming at fostering teachers to spread CS and CT related competencies to their pupils. The paper concludes by proposing new research directions and experiments that may be led in schools.","authors":["Gabrielė Stupurienė","Sébastien Combéfis"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_2","Conference: International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution, and PerspectivesAt: Estonia"],"references":["342679640_Exercising_the_Students_Computational_Thinking_Ability_using_Bebras_Challenge","341349350_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_Primary_Teachers_Evaluation_Using_Bebras","336201187_Educational_Robotics_in_Primary_School_Measuring_the_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_with_the_Bebras_Tasks","327445591_Developing_a_Computational_Thinking_Test_using_Bebras_problems","318469859_Complementary_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_Assessment","317013386_Exploring_Bebras_Tasks_Content_and_Performance_A_Multinational_Study","305084679_Learning_Programming_through_Games_and_Contests_Overview_Characterisation_and_Discussion","301429277_Playing_with_computing_at_a_children's_university","272679947_Investigating_the_Psychometric_Structure_of_Bebras_Contest_Towards_Mesuring_Computational_Thinking_Skills","337161623_Situated_Learning_with_Bebras_Tasklets","337161621_The_Genesis_of_a_Bebras_Task","337161563_From_Bebras_Tasks_to_Lesson_Plans_-_Graph_Data_Structures","335700606_Creativity_in_Solving_Short_Tasks_for_Learning_Computational_Thinking","334968286_Creating_the_Original_Bebras_Tasks_by_High_School_Students","331299910_How_Many_Abilities_Can_We_Measure_in_Computational_Thinking_A_Study_on_Bebras_Challenge","327218461_Exploration_of_Computational_Thinking_Based_on_Bebras_Performance_in_Webduino_Programming_by_High_School_Students_First_International_Conference_ICITL_2018_Portoroz_Slovenia_August_27-30_2018_Proceedi","318999655_Teaching_Graphs_for_Contestants_in_Lower-Secondary-School-Age"]}
