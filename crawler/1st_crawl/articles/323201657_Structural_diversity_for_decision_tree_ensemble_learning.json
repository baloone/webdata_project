{"id":"323201657_Structural_diversity_for_decision_tree_ensemble_learning","abstract":"Decision trees are a kind of off-the-shelf predictive models, and they have been successfully used as the base learners in ensemble learning. To construct a strong classifier ensemble, the individual classifiers should be accurate and diverse. However, diversity measure remains a mystery although there were many attempts. We conjecture that a deficiency of previous diversity measures lies in the fact that they consider only behavioral diversity, i.e., how the classifiers behavewhenmaking predictions, neglecting the fact that classifiers may be potentially different even when they make the same predictions. Based on this recognition, in this paper, we advocate to consider structural diversity in addition to behavioral diversity, and propose the TMD (tree matching diversity) measure for decision trees. To investigate the usefulness of TMD, we empirically evaluate performances of selective ensemble approacheswith decision forests by incorporating different diversity measures. Our results validate that by considering structural and behavioral diversities together, stronger ensembles can be constructed. This may raise a new direction to design better diversity measures and ensemble methods.
