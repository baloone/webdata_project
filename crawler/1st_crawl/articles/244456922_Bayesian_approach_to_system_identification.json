{"id":"244456922_Bayesian_approach_to_system_identification","abstract":"This chapter presents the identification problems via Bayesian statistics. In Bayesian view random means uncertain. Any quantity the true value of which is not known to the statistician is a random variable. Thus, not only time-varying quantities, like inputâ€“output data, but also unknown or uncertain constants, like model parameters, are random. A random variable can take on only one true value. If this true value is not known to the statistician, he has to take into account the whole set of values that the random variable could possibly take. The concept of subjective probability distribution introduced above would be of little practical value, at least in engineering and natural sciences, if it were not given how experimental evidence can be incorporated into it. In Bayesian view, the statistical inference can be understood as correction of prior subjective probability distribution by objective data.","authors":["V.
