{"id":"308965117_Deep_Learning_with_Coherent_Nanophotonic_Circuits","abstract":"Artificial neural networks are computational network models inspired by signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved performance for many machine-learning tasks, including speech and image recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made towards developing electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that exhibit improved computational speed and accuracy. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully optical neural network that, in principle, could offer an enhancement in computational speed and power efficiency over state-of-the-art electronics for conventional inference tasks. We experimentally demonstrate the essential part of the concept using a programmable nanophotonic processor featuring a cascaded array of 56 programmable Machâ€“Zehnder interferometers in a silicon photonic integrated circuit and show its utility for vowel recognition.","authors":["Yichen Shen","Nicholas Christopher Harris","Scott Skirlo","Mihika Prabhu"],"meta":["July 2017Nature Photonics 11(93)","DOI:10.1038/nphoton.2017.93"],"references":["309140162_ISAAC_A_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Accelerator_with_In-Situ_Analog_Arithmetic_in_Crossbars","301837424_Convolutional_Networks_for_Fast_Energy-Efficient_Neuromorphic_Computing","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","284476210_Unitary_Evolution_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","281152883_Perfect_optics_with_imperfect_components","280062012_Bosonic_transport_simulations_in_a_large-scale_programmable_nanophotonic_processor","277411157_Deep_Learning","277019568_Photonic_Neuromorphic_Signal_Processing_and_Computing","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","261808835_Efficient_compact_and_low_loss_thermo-optic_phase_shifter_in_silicon","261067692_Experimental_demonstration_of_reservoir_computing_on_a_silicon_photonics_chip","260868239_On-chip_optical_matrix-vector_multiplier","252512346_Speaker_Identification_Based_on_Log_Area_Ratio_and_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_in_Narrow-Band_Speech","238969823_Optical_bistability_in_finite-size_nonlinear_bidimensional_photonic_crystals_doped_by_a_microcavity","234098549_Large-scale_nanophotonic_phased_array","229035390_Semiconductor_Optical_Amplifiers_and_their_Applications","227175693_Monolayer_graphene_as_a_saturable_absorber_in_a_mode-locked_laser","223938078_Artificial_neural_networks_in_hardware_A_survey_of_two_decades_of_progress","221828834_Photonic_information_processing_beyond_Turing_An_optoelectronic_implementation_of_Reservoir_Computing","221668588_A_25_Gbs_Silicon_Photonics_Platform","220249298_Robust_optimization_with_simulated_annealing","51960402_Optoelectronic_Reservoir_Computing","51710519_Neuromorphic_Silicon_Neurons_and_Large-Scale_Neural_Networks_Challenges_and_Opportunities","51635005_Information_processing_using_a_single_dynamical_node_as_complex_system","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317664205_Quantum_transport_simulations_in_a_programmable_nanophotonic_processor","309091100_Hybrid_computing_using_a_neural_network_with_dynamic_external_memory","303405802_Recent_progress_in_semiconductor_excitable_lasers_for_photonic_spike_processing","292192469_Neuromorphic_electronic_systems","287964445_Single-chip_microprocessor_that_communicates_directly_using_light","287796672_Optically_reconfigurable_metasurfaces_and_photonic_devices_based_on_phase_change_materials","286218891_Semiconductor_Optical_Amplifiers","283778162_Quantum_Random_Walks_in_a_Programmable_Nanophotonic_Processor","283256949_Integrated_all-photonic_non-volatile_multi-level_memory","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","271463146_11_Computing's_energy_problem_and_what_we_can_do_about_it","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","265971295_Broadcast_and_Weight_An_Integrated_Network_For_Scalable_Photonic_Spike_Processing","264423290_Solving_Least_Square_Problems","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","260636152_In-Plane_Optical_Absorption_and_Free_Carrier_Absorption_in_Graphene-on-Silicon_Waveguides","237094149_Self-configuring_universal_linear_optical_component_Invited","236196175_Photonic_Floquet_Topological_Insulators","234936072_SPIE_Optical_Engineering_Applications","233898863_Photonic_Floquet_Topological_Insulators","231035715_Pulse_transmission_through_a_saturable_absorber","221774710_40Gbits_Germanium_waveguide_photodetector_on_silicon","50335919_Solving_Least_Squares_Problems","43324968_Sub-femtojoule_all-optical_switching_using_a_photonic-crystal_nanocavity","36209489_Speaker_Normalization_for_Automatic_Speech_Recognition","24207974_Low_Loss_Etchless_Silicon_Photonic_Waveguides","13235503_Experimental_observations_of_bistability_and_instability_in_a_two-dimensional_nonlinear_optical_superlattice","13233155_Experimental_realization_of_any_discrete_unitary_operator","10962450_Optical_Bistable_switching_in_nonlinear_photonic_crystals","7556463_Fast_bistable_all-optical_switch_and_memory_on_a_silicon_photonic_crystal_on-chip"]}
