{"id":"315835203_Adaptive_Quadrature_by_Expansion_for_Layer_Potential_Evaluation_in_Two_Dimensions","abstract":"When solving partial differential equations using boundary integral equation methods, accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular integrals in layer potentials is crucial. A recent scheme for this is quadrature by expansion (QBX), which solves the problem by locally approximating the potential using a local expansion centered at some distance from the source boundary. In this paper we introduce an extension of the QBX scheme in 2D denoted AQBX - adaptive quadrature by expansion - which combines QBX with an algorithm for automated selection of parameters, based on a target error tolerance. A key component in this algorithm is the ability to accurately estimate the numerical errors in the coefficients of the expansion. Combining previous results for flat panels with a procedure for taking the panel shape into account, we derive such error estimates for arbitrarily shaped boundaries in 2D that are discretized using panel-based Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Evaluating our scheme on the Laplace and Helmholtz equations we find that the scheme is able to satisfy a given target tolerance to within an order of magnitude, making it useful for practical applications. This represents a significant simplification over the original QBX algorithm, in which choosing a good set of parameters can be hard.","authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"meta":["April 2017SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 40(3)","DOI:10.1137/17M1121615","Project: Adaptive quadrature by expansion"],"references":["301878482_Error_estimation_for_quadrature_by_expansion_in_layer_potential_evaluation","301846702_Fast_algorithms_for_Quadrature_by_Expansion_I_Globally_valid_expansions","301648385_A_fast_integral_equation_method_for_solid_particles_in_viscous_flow_using_quadrature_by_expansion","258849721_Variants_of_an_explicit_kernel-split_panel-based_Nystrom_discretization_scheme_for_Helmholtz_boundary_value_problems","311430717_Ubiquitous_evaluation_of_layer_potentials_using_Quadrature_by_Kernel-Independent_Expansion","308883591_An_adaptive_fast_multipole_accelerated_Poisson_solver_for_complex_geometries","280590571_Accurate_Derivative_Evaluation_for_any_Grad-Shafranov_Solver","266677257_Spectrally_Accurate_Quadratures_for_Evaluation_of_Layer_Potentials_Close_to_the_Boundary_for_the_2D_Stokes_and_Laplace_Equations","258082715_Evaluation_of_Layer_Potentials_Close_to_the_Boundary_for_Laplace_and_Helmholtz_Problems_on_Analytic_Planar_Domains","257882867_An_explicit_kernel-split_panel-based_Nystrom_scheme_for_integral_equations_on_axially_symmetric_surfaces"]}
