{"id":"322957849_On_the_Essence_of_Parallel_Independence_for_the_Double-Pushout_and_Sesqui-Pushout_Approaches","abstract":"Parallel independence between transformation steps is a basic notion in the algebraic approaches to graph transformation, which is at the core of some static analysis techniques like Critical Pair Analysis. We propose a new categorical condition of parallel independence and show its equivalence with two other conditions proposed in the literature, for both left-linear and non-left-linear rules. Next we present some preliminary experimental results aimed at comparing the three conditions with respect to computational efficiency. To this aim, we implemented the three conditions, for left-linear rules only, in the Verigraph system, and used them to check parallel independence of pairs of overlapping redexes generated from some sample graph transformation systems over categories of typed graphs.","authors":["Andrea Corradini","Dominique Duval","Michael LÃ¶we","Leila Ribeiro"],"meta":["February 2018Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-75396-6_1","In book: Graph Transformation, Specifications, and Nets (pp.1-18)"],"references":["317037322_Granularity_of_Conflicts_and_Dependencies_in_Graph_Transformation_Systems","308877041_Formal_Verification_of_Health_Assessment_Tools_a_Case_Study","266985489_Reversible_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","221105687_Model_checking_dynamic_states_in_GROOVE","220713318_Graph_Rewriting_in_Span-Categories","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","220689262_Evaluation_of_functional_expressions_by_hypergraph_rewriting","220370051_On_Term_Graphs_as_an_Adhesive_Category","220367138_Efficient_Conflict_Detection_in_Graph_Transformation_Systems_by_Essential_Critical_Pairs","2777413_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_Part_I_Basic_Concepts_and_Double_Pushout_Approach","311256037_On_the_Definition_of_Parallel_Independence_in_the_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation","310049600_Verigraph_A_System_for_Specification_and_Analysis_of_Graph_Grammars","307960239_Certifying_Rule-Based_Models_using_Graph_Transformation","304370698_Parallelism_in_AGREE_Transformations","255674483_A_Church-Rosser_theorem_for_graph_grammars","247589871_SOME_SIMPLE_WORD_PROBLEMS_IN_UNIVERSAL_ALGEBRAS","225182466_Parallelism_of_Manipulations_in_Multidimensional_Information_Structures","221116944_AGG_A_Graph_Transformation_Environment_for_Modeling_and_Validation_of_Software","220713136_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","39994860_Adhesive_and_quasiadhesive_categories","2241317_Double-Pushout_Graph_Transformation_Revisited"]}
