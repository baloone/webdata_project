{"id":"323683231_Optimization_of_the_Paddy_Rice_Husking_Process_Increasing_the_useful_Life_of_the_Rollers_in_Florhuila_Plant_Campoalegre_Mills","abstract":"The objective of this research is to optimize the peeling process, through the study, measurement and analysis of the results obtained from the behavior of the rollers to increase their useful life, in the company: MOLINOS FLORHUILA SA Campoalegre Plant. First a brief introduction and a little history of rice cultivation in the different countries of the world and then we will go on to talk about the departments in Colombia that grow this product. In this context, the stages of the rice production process will be described in order to clarify our problems. In this study the variables that affect the stages of the rice production process, and then to present the tests that correspond to the results obtained from the behavior of the rollers to increase their useful life to and thus give solution to our problem.","authors":["Nelson Corredor Sanchez","Ana Lucia Paque Salazar","Andrés Mauricio Navarrete Ramos","Yeimy Muñoz Calderon"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Applied Engineering Research 13(6)","Project: Production control"],"references":["324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","322926365_Extraction_in_Laboratory_of_Heavy_Metals_Through_Rhizofiltration_using_the_Plant_Zea_Mays_maize","322687430_A_consistent_methodology_for_the_development_of_inverse_and_direct_kinematics_of_robust_industrial_robots","322594033_Dental_Caries_Social_Problem_in_School_Children_Aged_5-14_Years_from_Formal_Educational_Institutions_in_Huila_Colombia","322526369_Real_Process_Characteristic_Capacity_Weight_in_the_Product_500_Grams_in_a_Rice_Mill","321913209_Design_of_a_gas_sensor_based_on_the_concept_of_digital_interconnection_IoT_for_the_emergency_broadcast_system","321913089_Case_Study_of_Energy_Management_Model_in_the_Threshing_System_for_the_Production_of_White_Rice","321743256_Generation_and_Control_of_Basic_Geometric_Trajectories_for_a_Robot_Manipulator_Using_CompactRIOR","319523644_Audio_signals_processing_with_digital_filters_implementation_using_MyDSP","318600784_Natural_Reserves_of_Civil_Society_as_Strategic_Ecosystems_Case_Study_Meremberg"]}
