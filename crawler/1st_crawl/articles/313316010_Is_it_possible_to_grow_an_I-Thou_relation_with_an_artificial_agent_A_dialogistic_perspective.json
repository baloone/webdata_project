{"id":"313316010_Is_it_possible_to_grow_an_I-Thou_relation_with_an_artificial_agent_A_dialogistic_perspective","abstract":"The paper analyzes if it is possible to grow an I–Thou relation in the sense of Martin Buber with an artificial, conversational agent developed with Natural Language Processing techniques. The requirements for such an agent, the possible approaches for the implementation, and their limitations are discussed. The relation of the achievement of this goal with the Turing test is emphasized. Novel perspectives on the I–Thou and I–It relations are introduced according to the sociocultural paradigm and Mikhail Bakhtin’s dialogism, polyphony inter-animation, and carnavalesque. The polyphonic model, the associated analysis method, and the support tools are introduced. Some ideas on how the polyphonic model may be used for the implementation of a computer application able to analyze some features of the existence of an I–Thou relation are included.","authors":["Stefan Trausan-Matu"],"meta":["March 2019AI & SOCIETY 34(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00146-017-0696-5","Project: Polyphonic model of discourse"],"references":["324318795_Speech_Genres_and_Other_Late_Essays","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","308468610_Speech_and_language_processing_An_introduction_to_natural_language_processing_computational_linguistics_and_speech_recognition","292865707_The_Polyphonic_Model_of_Hybrid_and_Collaborative_Learning","287053715_How_does_emphatic_emotion_emerge_via_human-robot_rhythmic_interaction","281562459_Talking_voices_Repetition_dialogue_and_imagery_in_conversational_discourse","281562381_The_Dialogic_Imagination_Four_Essays","280113549_Speech_and_Language_Processing","275736998_Corporeal_Words_Mikhail_Bakhtin's_Theology_of_Discourse","275683009_The_Sane_Society","272563047_COMPUTER_SUPPORT_FOR_CREATIVITY_IN_SMALL_GROUPS_USING_CHATS","273969700_The_Dialogic_Imagination_Four_Essays","273947108_Existentialism","273947088_Rabelais_and_His_World","262486909_Mind_in_Life_Biology_Phenomenology_and_the_Sciences_of_Mind"]}
