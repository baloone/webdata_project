{"id":"269157742_Linear_algebra_for_skew-polynomial_matrices","abstract":"We describe an algorithm for transforming skew-polynomial matrices over an Ore domain in row-reduced form, and show that this algorithm can be used to perform the standard calculations of linear algebra on such matrices (ranks, kernels, linear dependences, inhomogeneous solving). The main application of our algorithm is to desingularize recurrences and to compute the rational solutions of a large class of linear functional systems. It also turns out to be efficient when applied to ordinary commutative matrix polynomials.","authors":["Sergei A.
