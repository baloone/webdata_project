{"id":"327043184_School_embedded_and_district-wide_instructional_coaching_in_K-8_computer_science_Implications_for_including_students_with_disabilities","abstract":"As school districts implement initiatives that bring computer science (CS) to academically diverse K-12 schools, they face heightened demands for supporting teachers in meeting the needs of a broad range of learners. However, limited knowledge exists about pedagogical approaches to teaching CS, especially to students with disabilities. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study of two CS instructional coaching models meant to support teachers in meeting the needs of diverse learners, including those with disabilities. One model involved a school-embedded coach and the other model involved a district-wide coach that traveled among multiple schools. Findings revealed that within both coaching models, co-planning and co-teaching played an integral role in supporting teachers in meeting the needs of students with disabilities. Instructional pedagogies that coaches promoted included scaffolded project planning, student collaboration, and immediate feedback to students. Within both coaching models, there was a focus on trust building and increasing teachersâ€™ instructional skills. Differences between coaching models included a stronger level of familiarity between the coach and teachers in the school-embedded coaching. There were also different approaches to accountability and co-planning logistics.","authors":["Maya Israel","Meg Ray","Wen Ma","Ga Kyung Jeong"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Technology and Teacher Education 26(3):471-501","Project: Project TACTIC: Teaching All Computational Thinking through Inclusion and Collaboration"],"references":["309086464_Measuring_computer_science_pedagogical_content_knowledge_An_exploratory_analysis_of_teaching_vignettes_to_measure_teacher_knowledge","308128849_Understanding_the_relationship_between_teachers'_pedagogical_beliefs_and_technology_use_in_education_A_systematic_review_of_qualitative_evidence","249022833_Teacher_Efficacy_and_Content_Literacy_Implementation_An_Exploration_of_the_Effects_of_Extended_Professional_Development_with_Coaching","241423878_Constructing_21st-Century_Teacher_Education","234563406_Exemplary_Technology-Using_Teachers_Perceptions_of_Factors_Influencing_Success","233363689_A_Description_of_Instructional_Coaching_and_its_Relationship_to_Consultation","233275969_The_Gradual_Increase_of_Responsibility_Model_Coaching_for_Teacher_Change","220422564_Pair_programming_improves_student_retention_confidence_and_program_quality","220094545_Pair-Programming_Helps_Female_Computer_Science_Students","323325225_A_Cross-Case_Analysis_of_Instructional_Strategies_to_Support_Participation_of_K-8_Students_with_Disabilities_in_CS_for_All","320353584_The_discovery_of_grounded_theory_1967","317433781_Workload_Manageability_Among_Novice_Special_and_General_Educators_Relationships_With_Emotional_Exhaustion_and_Career_Intentions","317223547_Seeing_Myself_through_Someone_Else's_Eyes_The_Value_of_In-Classroom_Coaching_for_Computer_Science_Teaching_and_Learning","316116948_Elementary_Students_and_Computer_Programming","311978475_Instructional_Coaching_as_High-Quality_Professional_Development","311488667_Three_Years_of_Student_Pair_Programming_Action_Research_Insights_and_Outcomes","307092527_For_all_in_computer_science_for_all","301745270_Instructional_supports_for_students_with_disabilities_in_K-5_computing_Findings_from_a_cross-case_analysis","300116922_How_Equity_and_Inequity_Can_Emerge_in_Pair_Programming","294425313_It_takes_a_village_supporting_inquiry-_and_equity-oriented_computer_science_pedagogy_through_a_professional_learning_community","285136602_Effective_inclusion_Professional_development_in_the_context_of_the_classroom","274998933_What_Works_in_Professional_Development","269724670_Supporting_all_learners_in_school-wide_computational_thinking_A_cross-case_qualitative_analysis","258193100_Using_Coaching_to_Improve_the_Fidelity_of_Evidence-Based_Practices_A_Review_of_Studies","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","242493620_Qualitative_Research_and_Case_Study_Applications","242224358_Improving_Impact_Studies_of_Teachers'_Professional_Development_Toward_Better_Conceptualizations_and_Measures","235726245_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Burnout_with_Job_Demands_Resources_and_Attitudes","234767415_Instructional_Coaching","222971576_Preparing_teachers_for_inclusive_classrooms","221538495_The_effects_of_pair-programming_on_individual_programming_skill","26734640_Weighted_Kappa_-_Nominal_Scale_Agreement_with_Provision_for_Scaled_Disagreement_Or_Partial_Credit","12710628_Enhancing_the_Quality_and_Credibilty_of_Qualitative_Analysis"]}
