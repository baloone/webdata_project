{"id":"350538390_A_machine_learning-based_pulmonary_venous_obstruction_prediction_model_using_clinical_data_and_CT_image","abstract":"PurposeIn this study, we try to consider the most common type of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and established a machine learning-based prediction model for postoperative pulmonary venous obstruction by using clinical data and CT images jointly.Method\nPatients diagnosed with supracardiac TPAVC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018, in Guangdong Province Peopleâ€™s Hospital were enrolled. Logistic regression were applied for clinical data features selection, while a convolutional neural network was used to extract CT images features. The prediction model was established by integrating the above two kinds of features for PVO prediction. And the proposed methods were evaluated using fourfold cross-validation.ResultFinally, 131 patients were enrolled in our study. Results show that compared with traditional approaches, the machine learning-based joint method using clinical data and CT image achieved the highest average AUC score of 0.943. In addition, the joint method also achieved a higher sensitivity of 0.828 and a higher positive prediction value of 0.864.Conclusion\nUsing clinical data and CT images jointly can improve the performance significantly compared with other methods that using only clinical data or CT images. The proposed machine learning-based joint method demonstrates the practicability of fully using multi-modality clinical data.","authors":["Zeyang Yao","Xinrong Hu","Xiaobing Liu","Wen Xie"],"meta":["March 2021International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery 16(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11548-021-02335-y"],"references":["334190835_Machine_learning_to_predict_cardiovascular_risk","328637851_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Capabilities_for_Binary_Classification_of_Polar_Mesocyclones_in_Satellite_Mosaics","327531968_Is_Sutureless_Technique_Beneficial_in_the_Primary_Repair_of_Total_Anomalous_Pulmonary_Venous_Connection_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","315779698_Can_Machine-learning_improve_cardiovascular_risk_prediction_using_routine_clinical_data","314433553_Spectral_Graph_Convolutions_for_Population-Based_Disease_Prediction","305460460_Moving_beyond_regression_techniques_in_cardiovascular_risk_prediction_Applying_machine_learning_to_address_analytic_challenges","296624579_Pulmonary_Nodule_Detection_in_CT_Images_False_Positive_Reduction_Using_Multi-View_Convolutional_Networks","276296679_Improving_Computer-Aided_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Random_View_Aggregation","233994851_Improved_Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction_Using_Nonparametric_Regression_and_Electronic_Health_Record_Data","225062917_Total_Anomalous_Pulmonary_Venous_Connection_Factors_Associated_With_Mortality_and_Recurrent_Pulmonary_Venous_Obstruction","6223113_Derivation_and_validation_of_QRISK_a_new_cardiovascular_disease_risk_score_for_the_United_Kingdom_Prospective_open_cohort_study","352961445_Abstract_284_Association_of_Pre-Operative_INR_Evaluation_with_Risk_of_Major_Adverse_Cardiac_Events_and_Bleeding_Complications_in_Cardiac_Patients_Undergoing_Non-Cardiac_Surgery","336462408_Diagnosing_Cardiac_Abnormalities_from_12-Lead_Electrocardiograms_Using_Enhanced_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","335009876_The_Quest_for_Precision_Medicine_Unmeasured_Patient_Factors_and_Mortality_After_Congenital_Heart_Surgery","334496624_Novel_Biomarkers_Improve_Prediction_of_365-Day_Readmission_After_Pediatric_Congenital_Heart_Surgery","331440787_Methods_for_updating_a_risk_prediction_model_for_cardiac_surgery_a_statistical_primer","327603039_Surgical_results_of_total_anomalous_pulmonary_venous_connection_repair_in_256_patients","323383482_Long-term_outcomes_of_total_correction_for_isolated_total_anomalous_pulmonary_venous_connection_lessons_from_50-years'_experience","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","316843307_Deep_learning_for_healthcare_review_opportunities_and_challenges","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284194538_Machine_Learning_in_Medicine","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263895386_Surgical_Outcomes_of_Total_Anomalous_Pulmonary_Venous_Connection_Repair_A_22-Year_Experience","236310864_Validation_of_the_Framingham_Coronary_Heart_Disease_Prediction_ScoresResults_of_a_Multiple_Ethnic_Groups_Investigation","51762512_Non-invasive_assessment_of_liver_fibrosis_in_patients_after_the_Fontan_operation","26891128_Binary_Tissue_Classification_on_Wound_Images_With_Neural_Networks_and_Bayesian_Classifiers","12519813_Congenital_Heart_Surgery_Nomenclature_and_Database_Project_Pulmonary_venous_anomalies","9761388_Total_anomalous_pulmonary_venous_connection","6498998_Risk_Index_for_Predicting_In-Hospital_Mortality_for_Cardiac_Valve_Surgery"]}
