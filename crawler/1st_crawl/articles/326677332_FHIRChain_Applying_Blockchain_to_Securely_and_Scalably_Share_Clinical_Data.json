{"id":"326677332_FHIRChain_Applying_Blockchain_to_Securely_and_Scalably_Share_Clinical_Data","abstract":"Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the “Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap” from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decision making for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study.","authors":["Peng Zhang","Jules White","Douglas Schmidt","Gunther Lenz"],"meta":["July 2018Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 16","DOI:10.1016/j.csbj.2018.07.004"],"references":["321674033_MediBchain_A_Blockchain_Based_Privacy_Preserving_Platform_for_Healthcare_Data","321147639_Blockchain_distributed_ledger_technologies_for_biomedical_and_health_care_applications","319928609_Secure_and_Trustable_Electronic_Medical_Records_Sharing_using_Blockchain","307156712_Healthcare_Data_Gateways_Found_Healthcare_Intelligence_on_Blockchain_with_Novel_Privacy_Risk_Control","289570061_Sharing_Clinical_Trial_Data_A_Proposal_From_the_International_Committee_of_Medical_Journal_Editors","283748831_Opening_clinical_trial_data_Are_the_voluntary_data-sharing_portals_enough","317558059_Applying_Software_Patterns_to_Address_Interoperability_in_Blockchain-based_Healthcare_Apps","313559746_Web-application_development_using_the_modelViewController_design_pattern","305820603_Strengthening_Research_through_Data_Sharing","293363468_Medical_Identity_Theft_and_Telemedicine_Security"]}
