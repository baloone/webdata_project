The\nemergence of global networks of computers corresponding to\nWireless Sensor network WSN is one of those great steps that\nman could do. WSN is an advanced technology that occur in\nresponse to overcome user needs. It resolves many problem such\nas, controlling phenomena, monitoring places, and diagnostic.\nNevertheless, this advanced technology still incomplete in order\nto different constraints such as energy consumption, routing,\naggregated data and security, also routing information represents\na critical issue in it. For that, great researches designed. In this\npaper, we present a survey of GAF and their enhanced versions\nas Location-Based routing protocols in WSN, which allows\nreducing the consumed energy in the network and prolonging the\nnetwork lifetime.","authors":["Hanane Aznaoui","Said Raghay","Layla Aziz"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["300409646_A_comparative_study_of_routing_protocols_in_WSN","273513099_A_Novel_Scheme_to_Minimize_Hop_Count_for_GAF_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Two-Level_GAF","265845857_Localization_in_wireless_sensor_networks_Classification_and_evaluation_of_techniques","224696131_WSN14-3_Honeycomb_Architecture_for_Energy_Conservation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","281448477_Optimized_GAF_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","265800371_Multi-hop_Topology_Control_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261313401_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","251936817_A_improved_GAF_clustering_algorithm_for_three-dimensional_underwater_acoustic_networks","236183037_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Networking_Perspective","224131808_GAFCo_Connectivity_Aware_Topology_Management_for_Sensor_Networks"]}
