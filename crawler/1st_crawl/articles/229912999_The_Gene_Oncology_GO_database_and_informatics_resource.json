{"id":"229912999_The_Gene_Oncology_GO_database_and_informatics_resource","abstract":"The Gene Ontology (GO) project (http://www. geneontology.org/) provides structured, controlled vocabularies and classifications that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology\nand are freely available for community use in the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences. Many model organism databases\nand genome annotation groups use the GO and contribute their annotation sets to the GO resource. The GO database integrates\nthe vocabularies and contributed annotations and provides full access to this information in several formats. Members of the\nGO Consortium continually work collectively, involving outside experts as needed, to expand and update the GO vocabularies.\nThe GO Web resource also provides access to extensive documentation about the GO project and links to applications that use\nGO data for functional analyses.","authors":["Midori Harris","Jennifer Deegan","A Ireland","Jane Lomax"],"meta":["February 2004Nucleic Acids Research 32(Database issue):258-261","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkh036"],"references":["285668548_Gene_ontology_Tool_for_the_unification_of_biology","224907031_Analysis_of_the_mouse_transcriptome_based_on_functional_annotation_of_60770_full-length_cDNAs","222009777_The_genome_sequence_of_Drosophila_melanogaster","220623082_Ontology-based_Knowledge_Representation_for_Bioinformatics","209408873_The_Genome_Sequence_of_Drosophila_melanogaster","200122963_Gene_Ontology_tool_for_the_unification_of_biology_The_Gene_Ontology_Consortium","51403962_The_Gene_Ontology_Annotation_GOA_project_-_application_of_GO_in_SWISS-PROT_TrEMBL_and_InterPro","245387174_Analysis_of_the_mouse_transcriptome_based_on_functional_annotation_of_60","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","24682463_Creating_the_Gene_Ontology_Resource_Design_and_Implementation"]}
