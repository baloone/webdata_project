{"id":"299584245_PARAMETERS_TUNING_OF_EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM_FOR_THE_ORIENTEERING_PROBLEM","abstract":"Various classes of algorithms solving optimization problems have some set of parameters. Setting them to appropriate values can be as important to results quality as choosing right algorithm components. Parameter calibration can be a complex optimization problem itself and many meta-algorithms were proposed to deal with it in a more automatic way. This paper presents automatic parameter tuning of an evolutionary algorithm solving the Orienteering Problem. ParamsILS method was chosen as a tuner. Obtained results show the importance of appropriate parameter setting in evolutionary algorithms: tuned algorithm achieved very high-quality solutions on known Orienteering Problem benchmarks.","authors":["Krzysztof Ostrowski"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":["299584258_Comparison_of_Different_Graph_Weights_Representations_Used_to_Solve_the_Time-Dependent_Orienteering_Problem","267875936_GRASP_with_path_relinking_for_the_orienteering_problem","260012732_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Path_Relinking_for_the_Orienteering_Problem_with_Time_Windows","255353181_Traveling_Salesman_Problems_With_Profits","295504690_A_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Grouping_Selection_and_Searching_Operators_for_the_Orienteering_Problem","292446196_Taguchi_Methods_Design_of_experiments","288961745_A_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Multiple_Mutation_which_Solves_Orienteering_Problem_in_Large_Networks","265533484_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","263595747_Using_Experimental_Design_to_Find_Effective_Parameter_Settings_for_Heuristics","244114674_GECCO99_Proceedings_of_the_Genetic_and_Evolutionary_Computation_Conference"]}
