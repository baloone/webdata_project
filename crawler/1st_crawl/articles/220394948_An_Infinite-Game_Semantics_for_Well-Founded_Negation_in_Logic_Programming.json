{"id":"220394948_An_Infinite-Game_Semantics_for_Well-Founded_Negation_in_Logic_Programming","abstract":"We present an inflnite-game characterization of the well-founded semantics for function-free logic programs with negation. Our game is a simple generalization of the standard game for negation-less logic programs introduced by M.H. van Em- den (1986, Journal of Logic Programming, 3(1), 37-53) in which two players, the Believer and the Doubter, compete by trying to prove (respectively disprove) a query. The standard game is equivalent to the minimum Herbrand model semantics of logic programming in the sense that a query succeeds in the minimum model semantics ifi the Believer has a winning strategy for the game which begins with the Doubter doubting this query. The game for programs with negation that we propose follows the same rules as the standard one, except that the players swap roles every time the play \\passes through\" negation. We start our investigation by establishing the determinacy of the new game by using some classical tools from the theory of inflnite-games. Our determinacy result immediately provides a novel and purely game-theoretic characterization of the semantics of negation in logic pro- gramming. We proceed to establish the connections of the game semantics to the existing semantic approaches for logic programming with negation. For this pur- pose, we flrst deflne a reflned version of the game that uses degrees of winning and losing for the two players. We then demonstrate that this reflned game corresponds exactly to the inflnite-valued minimum model semantics of negation (Rondogiannis & Wadge, 2005, ACM TOCL, 6(2), 441-467). This immediately implies that the un- reflned game is equivalent to the well-founded semantics (since the inflnite-valued semantics is a reflnement of the well-founded semantics).","authors":["Chrysida Galanaki","Panos Rondogiannis","William W.
