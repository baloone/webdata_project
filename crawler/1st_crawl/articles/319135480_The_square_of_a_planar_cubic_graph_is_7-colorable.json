{"id":"319135480_The_square_of_a_planar_cubic_graph_is_7-colorable","abstract":"We prove the conjecture made by G.Wegner in 1977 that the square of every planar, cubic graph is $7$-colorable. Here, $7$ cannot be replaced by $6$.","authors":["Carsten Thomassen"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 128","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2017.08.010"],"references":["301878155_The_chromatic_number_of_the_square_of_subcubic_planar_graphs","276296498_List-Coloring_the_Squares_of_Planar_Graphs_without_4-Cycles_and_5-Cycles","258217481_A_short_survey_on_some_generalized_colorings_of_graphs","278413657_Coloring_the_squares_of_graphs_whose_maximum_average_degrees_are_less_than_4","257585863_An_optimal_square_coloring_of_planar_graphs","245790109_Contribution_to_the_theory_of_Eulerian_polyhedra","244428355_Graphs_with_Given_Diameter_and_a_Coloring_Problem","222823289_A_bound_on_the_chromatic_number_of_the_square_of_a_planar_graph","222810541_Coloring_squares_of_planar_graphs_with_girth_six","216877583_Graph_Coloring_Problems","2841859_A_Bound_on_the_Chromatic_Number_of_the_Square_of_a_Planar_Graph"]}
