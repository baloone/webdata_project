{"id":"317443926_A_Scholar-Practitioner_Perspective_on_a_Leadership_Development_Program_in_Health_Care_Integrating_Connectivism_Theory","abstract":"The Problem\nThe U.S. health care system is currently undergoing reform, shifting from a volume to a value-based model. This transformation calls for strong leadership among physicians; however, they are often not prepared for leading changes for multiple reasons. Furthermore, physicians can be a challenging group to train when it comes to nonmedical disciplines. Therefore, identifying what will engage physicians in learning nonclinical topics is crucial for effective leadership development.\n\nThe Solution\nI attempt to discuss this aspect by utilizing a year-long leadership development program, which yielded great response from physicians in terms of perceived value of learning. Exploring a more recent learning theory (connectivism) that considers the role of building personal learning networks (PLNs), I describe how the program unfolded and how the slow but steady emergence of PLNs became the basis for the learning. I also illustrate how theory has been used to guide program development, leading to successful outcomes.\n\nThe Stakeholders\nScholar-practitioners within human resource development (HRD), and leadership development professionals can be inspired to apply connectivism as a lens to further understand adult learning theories in the era of information and technology as well as apply to the development of leadership programs aimed at highly skilled professional groups.","authors":["Kristina Natt och Dag"],"meta":["June 2017Advances in Developing Human Resources 19(3):152342231771267","DOI:10.1177/1523422317712671"],"references":["276071131_The_Affordable_Care_Act_at_5_Years","258123699_A_Scholar-Practitioner_Case_Approach_Implications_for_Advancing_Theory_and_Research_Through_Informed_Practice","235885337_Connectivism_and_Dimensions_of_Individual_Experience","229037574_Connectivism_and_the_Impact_of_Web_20_Technologies_on_Education","50888833_Proposing_an_Integrated_Research_Framework_for_Connectivism_Utilising_Theoretical_Synergies","50888830_Connectivism_Its_Place_in_Theory-Informed_Research_and_Innovation_in_Technology-Enabled_Learning","50888826_The_Challenges_of_Connectivist_Learning_on_Open_Online_Networks_Learning_Experiences_During_a_Massive_Open_Online_Course","26544860_Connectivism_Learning_Theory_of_the_Future_or_Vestige_of_the_Past","318546959_Just_the_Facts_Personal_Learning_Networks","301148857_An_Evaluation_of_a_Training_Program","292366853_Leadership_in_Healthcare","280204880_Foundations_of_Human-resource_Development_2nd_ed","272938669_The_Social_Transformation_of_American_Medicine_The_Rise_of_a_Sovereign_Profession_and_the_Making_of_a_Vast_Industry","265238210_Why_We_Built_the_Ivory_Tower","263431815_The_value_of_physician_leadership","257998553_The_Core_Competence_of_the_Corporation","249631622_The_Link_Between_Research_and_Practice_Experiences_of_HRD_and_Other_Professions","247712897_Collaborative_Learning_A_Core_Capability_for_Organizations_in_the_New_Economy","241684950_Connectivism_Learning_theory_and_pedagogical_practice_for_networked_information_landscapes","240691346_Defining_HRD_Scholar-Practitioners","237540437_Response_Shift_Bias_A_Problem_In_Evaluating_Leadership_Development_With_Self-Report_Pretest-Posttest_Measures","235360932_Social-learning_theory_of_identificatory_processes","230053439_The_Power_of_Feelings_Emotion_Imagination_and_the_Construction_of_Meaning_in_Adult_Learning","229068410_Growing_Up_Digital_How_the_Web_Changes_Work_Education_and_the_Ways_People_Learn","228500424_The_Courage_to_be_Constructivist","220042179_Collective_learning_A_way_over_the_ridge_to_a_new_organizational_attractor","220017733_Connectivism_A_Learning_Theory_for_the_Digital_Age","33052114_Diverse_Voices_and_Alternative_Rationalities_Imagining_Forms_of_Postcolonial_Organizational_Communication","24439963_Developing_Physician-Leaders_A_Call_to_Action","12763286_How_Doctors_Learn_Physicians_self-directed_learning_episodes","6451221_How_Physicians_Can_Change_the_Future_of_Health_Care"]}
