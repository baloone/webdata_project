{"id":"221309033_Playing_a_Toy-Grammar_with_GCS","abstract":"Grammar-based Classifier System (GCS) is a new version of Learning Classifier Systems in which classifiers are represented\nby context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Discovering component of the GCS and fitness function were modified\nand applied for inferring a toy-grammar, a tiny natural language grammar expressed in CNF. The results obtained proved that\nproposed ruleâ€™s fertility improves performance of the GCS considerably.","authors":["Olgierd Unold"],"meta":["June 2005","DOI:10.1007/11499305_31","SourceDBLP","Conference: Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering Applications: A Bioinspired Approach: First International Work-Conference on the Interplay Between Natural and Artificial Computation, IWINAC 2005, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Spain, June 15-18, 2005, Proceedings, Part II"],"references":["267378096_Context-free_grammar_induction_using_evolutionary_methods","234809540_Grammatical_inference_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","225456119_A_Roadmap_to_the_Last_Decade_of_Learning_Classifier_System_Research_From_1989_to_1999","221462232_Analysis_of_Selection_Mutation_and_Recombination_in_Genetic_Algorithms","2817307_Classifier_Fitness_Based_on_Accuracy","2797102_Learning_Language_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","2507729_Learning_Stochastic_Context-Free_Grammars_from_Corpora_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm","2447217_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Induction_of_Nondeterministic_Pushdown_Automata","2370874_Genetic_Programming_for_Grammar_Induction","2249558_Regular_Grammatical_Inference_from_Positive_and_Negative_Samples_by_Genetic_Search_the_GIG_method","313077576_Escaping_brittleness_The_possibilities_of_general_purpose_learning_algorithms_applied_to_parallel_rule-based_systems","302585709_Learning_SCFGs_from_Corpora_by_a_Genetic_Algorithm","285182931_Adaptation","268043850_AN_EVOLUTIONARY_APPROACH_TO_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GRAMMAR_INDUCTION","243779768_Induction_of_finite_automata_by_genetic_algorithms","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","222493158_Learning_Syntactic_Rules_and_Tags_with_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Information_Retrieval_and_Filtering_An_Empirical_Basis_for_Grammatical_Rules","222445347_Language_Identification_in_the_Limit","222191456_Recognition_and_Parsing_of_Context_Free_Languages_in_Time_n3","221275594_Current_Trends_in_Grammatical_Inference","220344008_Queries_and_Concept_Learning","201976460_Escaping_Brittleness_The_Possibilities_of_General--Purpose_Learning_Algorithms_Applied_to_Parallel_Rule-Based_Systems","3949471_Learning_grammars_with_a_modified_classifier_system","3585684_Context_free_grammar_induction_using_genetic_algorithms","2752873_Stochastic_Context-Free_Grammar_Induction_with_a_Genetic_Algorithm_Using_Local_Search","2649630_Learning_Grammatical_Rules_From_Examples_Using_A_Credit_Assignment_Algorithm","2585192_Learning_of_Context-Free_Languages_A_Survey_of_the_Literature"]}
