{"id":"331344763_Peer_to_Peer_Multimedia_Real-Time_Communication_System_based_on_WebRTC_Technology","abstract":"In the modern world and fast development of the internet, the connection among people is being very significant than ever, people are looking for new methods to do advance communication between them without any issue, real-time communication is one of this ways. WebRTC (Web real-time communication) is a futuristic technology that makes real-time communication capabilities in audio, video and data transmission possible in real time communication through web browsers by using JavaScript APIs (Application Programming Interface) without the plug-in. In this paper, we proposed a web peer to peer real time communication system that allows users to communicate with high-speed data transmission over the communication channel using WebRTC technology, HTML5 and use Node.js server address. The result shows that the system is stable, fully functional, safe and can use in a practical network to transmit and receive multimedia data in real time between users.","authors":["Zinah Nayyef","Sarah Faris Amer","Zena Hussain"],"meta":["February 2019International Journal for the History of Engineering & Technology 2.9(7):125-130"],"references":["327349843_Maintaining_Security_and_Privacy_in_Health_Care_System_Using_Learning_Based_Deep-Q-Networks","319999155_Enhance_of_Extreme_Learning_Machine-Genetic_Algorithm_Hybrid_Based_on_Intrusion_Detection_System","308828991_Cross-platform_web_based_real-time_communication_in_web_TV_and_video_on_demand_systems","327993327_Genetic_case-based_reasoning_for_improved_mobile_phone_faults_diagnosis","321415357_A_design_of_multimedia_conferencing_system_based_on_WebRTC_Technology","317555497_Energy-Aware_Fault_Tolerant_Task_offloading_of_Mobile_Cloud_Computing","316905982_P2P_video_conferencing_system_based_on_WebRTC","316903942_A_WebRTC-based_video_conferencing_system_with_screen_sharing","308872347_WebRTC_technology_overview_and_signaling_solution_design_and_implementation","261427641_Design_and_realization_of_chatting_tool_based_on_web"]}
