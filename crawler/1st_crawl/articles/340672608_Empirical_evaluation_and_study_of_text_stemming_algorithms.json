{"id":"340672608_Empirical_evaluation_and_study_of_text_stemming_algorithms","abstract":"Text stemming is one of the basic preprocessing step for Natural Language Processing applications which is used to transform different word forms into a standard root form. For Arabic script based languages, adequate analysis of text by stemmers is a challenging task due to large number of ambigious structures of the language. In literature, multiple performance evaluation metrics exist for stemmers, each describing the performance from particular aspect. In this work, we review and analyze the text stemming evaluation methods in order to devise criteria for better measurement of stemmer performance. Role of different aspects of stemmer performance measurement like main features, merits and shortcomings are discussed using a resource scarce language i.e. Urdu. Through our experiments we conclude that the current evaluation metrics can only measure an average conflation of words regardless of the correctness of the stem. Moreover, some evaluation metrics favor some type of languages only. None of the existing evaluation metrics can perfectly measure the stemmer performance for all kind of languages. This study will help researchers to evaluate their stemmer using right methods.","authors":["Abdul Jabbar","Sajid Iqbal","Manzoor Ilahi Tamimy","Shafiq Hussain"],"meta":["December 2020Artificial Intelligence Review 53(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10462-020-09828-3"],"references":["328730510_Enhancement_of_Detecting_Wicked_Website_Through_Intelligent_Methods","326258662_Improving_Kurdish_Web_Mining_through_Tree_Data_Structure_and_Porter's_Stemmer_Algorithms","325302707_An_improved_Urdu_stemming_algorithm_for_text_mining_based_on_multi-step_hybrid_approach","322777526_Experimental_Analysis_of_Stemming_on_Jurisprudential_Documents_Retrieval","330690794_Unsupervised_Joint_PoS_Tagging_and_Stemming_for_Agglutinative_Languages","328355682_Generation_implementation_and_appraisal_of_an_N-gram-based_stemming_algorithm","326566237_The_Rule-Based_Sundanese_Stemmer","326470374_A_Cognitive_Inspired_Unsupervised_Language-Independent_Text_Stemmer_for_Information_Retrieval","326280542_Templatic_morphology_as_an_emergent_property_Roots_and_functional_heads_in_Hebrew","324631249_A_Study_of_Graph_Based_Stemmer_in_Arabic_Extrinsic_Plagiarism_Detection"]}
