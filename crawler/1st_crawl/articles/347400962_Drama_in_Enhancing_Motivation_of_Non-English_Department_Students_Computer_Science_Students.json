Most of the students are in low motivation to learn a foreign language including English because they are more interested in their main subject than the supported subject. They assumed that English is difficult and complicated so that they have a low desire to learn the subject. It affects their competences and performances, therefore another creative method is crucial to be implemented in the classroom.
