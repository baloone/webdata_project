{"id":"260468108_Economic_Value_of_Weather_and_Climate_Forecasts","abstract":"Weather and climate extremes can significantly impact the economics of a\nregion. This book examines how weather and climate forecasts can be\nused to mitigate the impact of the weather on the economy.\nInterdisciplinary in scope, it explores the meteorological, economic,\npsychological, and statistical aspects of weather prediction. Chapters\nby area specialists provide a comprehensive view of this timely topic.\nThey encompass forecasts over a wide range of temporal scales, from\nweather over the next few hours to the climate months or seasons ahead,\nand address the impact of these forecasts on human behavior. Economic\nValue of Weather and Climate Forecasts seeks to determine the economic\nbenefits of existing weather forecasting systems and the incremental\nbenefits of improving these systems, and will be an interesting and\nessential text for economists, statisticians, and meteorologists.","authors":["Richard W.
