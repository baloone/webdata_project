{"id":"272818467_Can_Serious_Games_Contribute_to_Developing_and_Sustaining_21st-Century_Skills","abstract":"Serious games (SG) are innovative tools that are widely recognized as having considerable potential to foster and support active learning. This article addresses the question of whether and how SG can contribute to the development of the so-called “21st century skills” in education. This article starts by characterizing the current need for 21st century skills and the identification of these core skills. Thereafter, it reports on a literature review of studies analyzing SG impact on the development of one or more 21st century skills; and finally, it analyzes which, among the most relevant game characteristics, are those that could facilitate 21st century skills development. This study offers a multifold perspective on the use of SG to support 21st century skills development that may be helpful for both teachers and SG designers.","authors":["Margarida Romero","Mireia Usart","Michela Ott"],"meta":["January 2014Games and Culture 10(2)","DOI:10.1177/1555412014548919","Project: #EduJeux Digital Game Based Learning (DGBL)"],"references":["316856694_The_relevance_of_video_games_and_gaming_consoles_to_the_Higher_and_Further_Education_learning_experience","284024653_Towards_a_Reconceptualization_of_Simulation_From_Representation_to_Reality","324391460_Theory_in_Practice_Increasing_Professional_Effectiveness","318852853_Multicultural_Counseling_Competencies_and_Standards_A_Call_to_the_Profession","306154250_Serious_games_taxonomy","297666851_The_Play_of_Imagination_Extending_the_Literary_Mind","295636398_Building_a_business_simulation_for_kids","294583573_Computer_games_use_in_an_educational_system","288926624_Comparing_frameworks_for_21st_century_skills","279187296_Philosophical_Investigations_PI","277199289_Impact_of_Business_Simulation_Games_in_Enterprise_Education","272818277_Creativity_in_Collaborative_Learning_across_the_Life_Span","277924390_Leadership_and_the_Millennials_Transforming_Today's_Technological_Teens_into_Tomorrow's_Leaders","273946930_Chris_Crawford_on_Game_Design","272177873_Defining_21st_Century_Skills"]}
