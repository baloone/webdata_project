{"id":"333797924_Commentary_Aedes_albopictus_and_Aedes_japonicus-two_invasive_mosquito_species_with_different_temperature_niches_in_Europe","abstract":"In this interesting and original study, the authors present an ensemble Machine Learning (ML) model for the prediction of the habitats’ suitability, which is affected by the complex interactions\nbetween living conditions and survival-spreading climate factors. The research focuses in two of the most dangerous invasive mosquito species in Europe with the requirements’ identification in\ntemperature and rainfall conditions. Though it is an interesting approach, the ensemble ML model is not presented and discussed in sufficient detail and thus its performance and value as a tool for\nmodeling the distribution of invasive species cannot be adequately evaluated.","authors":["Konstantinos Demertzis"],"meta":["December 2017","Project: Intelligent information systems, aiming in the assessment of environmental problems and risks"],"references":["333222174_Cyber-Typhon_An_Online_Multi-Task_Anomaly_Detection_Framework","333221494_A_Machine_Hearing_Framework_for_Real-Time_Streaming_Analytics_using_Lambda_Architecture","330318286_The_Next_Generation_Cognitive_Security_Operations_Center_Adaptive_Analytic_Lambda_Architecture_for_Efficient_Defense_against_Adversarial_Attacks","329129120_The_Next_Generation_Cognitive_Security_Operations_Center_Network_Flow_Forensics_Using_Cybersecurity_Intelligence","327834711_Hybrid_Soft_Computing_for_Atmospheric_Pollution-Climate_Change_Data_Mining","327658732_Blockchain-based_Consents_Management_for_Personal_Data_Processing_in_the_IoT_Ecosystem","326521693_Extreme_Deep_Learning_in_Biosecurity_The_case_of_machine_hearing_for_marine_species_identification","326352935_MOLESTRA_A_Multi-Task_Learning_Approach_for_Real-Time_Big_Data_Analytics","326204431_A_Computational_Intelligence_System_Identifying_Cyber-Attacks_on_Smart_Energy_Grids","326051538_Soft_computing_forecasting_of_cardiovascular_and_respiratory_incidents_based_on_climate_change_scenarios"]}
