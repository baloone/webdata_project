In\nthis work, the main software tools for implementing distributed computing,\nwhich involves a set of software components for collecting, processing, and\nanalyzing large amounts of data, are considered. In addition, various\napproaches for task coordination between different sets of software are\ndiscussed and techniques for storing large amounts of data are described. The\nsystem architecture and database schema are designed and tested. Nowadays, the\nintellectualization of individual software agents is a key aspect of a new\ngeneration of multiagent systems. For this reason, this paper develops an\napproach that can organize activities of a large number of software agents to\nincrease system intellectualization through swarm intelligence at the level of\nindividual agents. Three remote servers were used to build and test the system\ndeployment, comprising such components as a platform for monitoring and\nscheduling workflow, data storage, and a graphical user interface that enables\ndata retrieval and interaction on the Internet.","authors":["Boris Onykiy","Evgeniy Antonov","Alexey Artamonov","Evgeny Tretyakov"],"meta":["December 2020International Journal of Technology 11(6):1125","DOI:10.14716/ijtech.v11i6.4465"],"references":["340700072_Performance_Analysis_of_Distributed_Processing_System_using_Shard_Selection_Techniques_on_Elasticsearch","340672096_Parametric_and_semantic_analytical_search_indexes_in_hieroglyphic_languages","330680560_Optimal_Task_Scheduling_in_the_Cloud_Environment_using_a_Mean_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Algorithm","341760613_Design_and_Implementation_of_Elasticsearch_for_Media_Data","341496688_Design_and_Implementation_of_Data_Acquisition_System_Based_on_Scrapy_Technology","340972560_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Elasticsearch_LOGSTASH_And_KIBANA","339484019_Exploration_of_Workflow_Management_Systems_Emerging_Features_from_Users_Perspectives","339170642_Automatic_Network_Application_System_Based_on_Selenium","332937479_SEARCH_AND_INDEX_DATA_USING_ELASTICSEARCH","329952066_An_IoT_Protocol_Evaluation_in_a_Smart_Factory_Environment"]}
