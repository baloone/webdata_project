{"id":"307999349_A_proposed_paradigm_for_smart_learning_environment_based_on_semantic_web","abstract":"The current approaches of e-learning face challenges, in isolation of learners from learning process, and shortage of learning process quality. The researchers mentioned that the next generation of e-learning is e-learning ecosystem. E-learning ecosystem has many advantages, in which, learners form groups, collaborate with each other and with educators, and content designed for interaction. E-learning ecosystem faces some issues. It applies teacher-student model, in which, fixed learning pathway is considered suitable for all learners. Consequently, learners are presented with limited personalized materials. E-learning ecosystem needs to merge the personalization's concept. Semantic web ontology based personalization of learning environment plays a leading role to build smart e-learning ecosystem.\nThis paper previews a detailed study which addresses research papers that apply ontology within learning environment. Most of these studies focus on personalizing e-learning by providing learners with suitable learning objects, ignoring the other learning process components. This paper proposes and implements framework for smart e-learning ecosystem using ontology and SWRL. A new direction is proposed. This direction fosters the creation of a separate four ontologies for the personalized full learning package which is composed of learner model and all the learning process components (learning objects, learning activities and teaching methods).","authors":["Shimaa Ouf","Mahmoud Abd Ellatif","S.E.
