{"id":"327640467_Assessing_aesthetic_criteria_in_the_evolutionary_dungeon_designer","abstract":"The Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) [1] is as a mixed-initiative tool for creating dungeons for adventure games. Results from a user study with game developers positively evaluated EDD as a suitable framework for collaboration between human designers and PCG suggestions, highlighting these as time-saving and inspiring for creating dungeons [2].\nPrevious work on EDD identified the need of assessing aesthetic criteria as a key area for improvement in its PCG Engine. By upgrading the individual encoding system and the fitness evaluation in EDD's evolutionary algorithm, we present three techniques to preserve and account the designer's aesthetic criteria during the dungeon generation process: the capability of locking sections for preserving custom aesthetic structures, as well as the measurement of symmetry and similarity in the provided suggestions.","authors":["Alberto Alvarez","Steve Dahlskog","Jose Font","Johan Holmberg"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3235765.3235810","Conference: the 13th International Conference"],"references":["320971548_Primal-improv_Towards_co-evolutionary_musical_improvisation","235974397_Evolving_Levels_for_Super_Mario_Bros_Using_Grammatical_Evolution","221157637_Evolving_content_in_the_Galactic_Arms_Race_video_game","220742669_Interactively_evolving_harmonies_through_functional_scaffolding","320743115_Mixed-initiative_procedural_generation_of_dungeons_using_game_design_patterns","319370558_Towards_pattern-based_mixed-initiative_dungeon_generation","309277998_The_search-based_approach","309037568_A_Computational_Model_based_on_Symmetry_for_Generating_Visually_Pleasing_Maps_of_Platform_Games","301519865_Constrained_Level_Generation_Through_Grammar-Based_Evolutionary_Algorithms","295504800_DrawCompileEvolve_Sparking_Interactive_Evolutionary_Art_with_Human_Creations","273590060_Evolving_Personas_for_Player_Decision_Modeling","260739760_Integrating_aesthetic_criteria_with_evolutionary_processes_in_complex_free-form_design_-_An_initial_investigation","235974391_Adapting_Models_of_Visual_Aesthetics_for_Personalized_Content_Creation"]}
