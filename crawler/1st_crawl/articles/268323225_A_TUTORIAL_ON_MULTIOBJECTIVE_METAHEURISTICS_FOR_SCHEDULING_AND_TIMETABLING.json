{"id":"268323225_A_TUTORIAL_ON_MULTIOBJECTIVE_METAHEURISTICS_FOR_SCHEDULING_AND_TIMETABLING","abstract":"Many real-world scheduling problems such as machine scheduling, academic timetabling and personnel scheduling are multiobjective by nature. That is, there exist several criteria that must be taken into consideration when evaluating the quality of the proposed solution or schedule. It is common that some or all of these criteria are conflicting, perhaps incommensurable and set by more than one decision-maker. Among these criteria there are for example: length of the schedule, utilisation of resources, satisfaction of people's preferences and compliance with regulations. Traditionally, these problems have been tackled as single-objective optimisation problems after combining the multiple criteria into a single scalar value. On the other hand, a number of multiobjective metaheuristics have been proposed over recent years in order to obtain a set of compromise solutions for multiobjective optimisation problems in a single run and without the need of converting the problem to a single-objective one. Most of these techniques have been successfully tested in both benchmark and real-world multiobjective optimisation problems. However, after reviewing the specialised literature, it is noted that the number of reported applications of these modern multiobjective metaheuristics to the class of scheduling problems is still scarce. This paper attempts to be an introductory tutorial on the application of multiobjective metaheuristics to the optimisation of some multiple criteria scheduling problems. This tutorial presents an introduction to the fundamental concepts of multiple criteria decision-making and multiobjective optimisation, gives an overview of some multiobjective metaheuristics that have been proposed over recent years, revises some of the multiobjective approaches that have been applied to some multi criteria scheduling problems, tries to identify the strategies that have been successful in this area and also seeks to identify some promising research directions that may be benefit a wider application of multiobjective metaheuristics to the optimisation of multiple criteria scheduling problems.","authors":["J D Landa Silva","E K
