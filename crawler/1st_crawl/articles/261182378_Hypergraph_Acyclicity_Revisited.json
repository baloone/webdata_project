{"id":"261182378_Hypergraph_Acyclicity_Revisited","abstract":"The notion of graph acyclicity has been extended to several different notions\nof hypergraph acyclicity, in increasing order of generality: gamma acyclicity,\nbeta acyclicity, and alpha acyclicity, that have met a great interest in many\nfields. We prove the equivalence between the numerous characterizations of each\nnotion with a new, simpler proof, in a self-contained manner. For that purpose,\nwe introduce new notions of alpha, beta and gamma leaf that allow to define new\n\"rule-based\" characterizations of each notion. The combined presentation of the\nnotions is completed with a study of their respective closure properties. New\nclosure results are established, and alpha, beta and gamma acyclicity are\nproved optimal w.r.t. their closure properties.","authors":["Johann Brault-Baron"],"meta":["March 2014ACM Computing Surveys 49(3)","DOI:10.1145/2983573","SourcearXiv"],"references":["238872253_Graph_minor_theory","234808699_A_simplied_universal_relation_assumption_and_its_properties","225035500_Foundations_of_Databases","220432198_Degrees_of_Acyclicity_for_Hypergraphs_and_Relational_Database_Schemes","200034411_The_Complexity_of_Acyclic_Conjunctive_Queries","200034389_On_the_Desirability_of_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","200034379_Algorithms_for_Acyclic_Database_Schemes","316805309_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","302558561_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","273798010_Graph_Theory","267430572_A_Negative_Conjunctive_Query_is_Easy_if_and_only_if_it_is_Beta-Acyclic","267114728_Graph_theory_4th_ed","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","262604030_Understanding_model_counting_for_b-acyclic_CNF-formulas","262250190_Groupoids_Hypergraphs_and_Symmetries_in_Finite_Models","259893444_Hypergraph_Acyclicity_and_Propositional_Model_Counting","257145093_Hypertree-depth_and_minors_in_hypergraphs","255658327_Some_characterizations_of_and_-acyclicity_of_hypergraphs","247931594_Satisfiability_of_Acyclic_and_Almost_Acyclic_CNF_Formulas","246227710_Foundations_of_Databases_The_Logical_Level","242793257_Hypergraphs_with_cyclomatic_number_zero_triangulated_graphs_and_an_inequality","242378067_On_the_universal_relation","233933114_A_super-balanced_hypergraph_has_a_nest_point","230595844_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","222928995_On_the_Complexity_of_Database_Queries","222440655_Problems_complete_for_deterministic_logarithmic_space","222437492_Tree_clustering_for_constraint_networks","222115289_Seymour_PD_Graph_minors_II_Algorithmic_aspects_of_tree-width_J_Algorithms_73_309-322","221558331_On_Acyclic_Conjunctive_Queries_and_Constant_Delay_Enumeration","220617927_Simple_Linear-Time_Algorithms_to_Test_Chordality_of_Graphs_Test_Acyclicity_of_Hypergraphs_and_Selectively_Reduce_Acyclic_Hypergraphs","220430372_Undirected_connectivity_in_log-space","220193514_Graph_whose_neighborhoods_have_no_special_cycles","220111502_On_Hypergraph_Acyclicity_and_Graph_Chordality","220079005_Graph_minors_XXIII_Nash-Williams'_immersion_conjecture","200034147_Hypertree_Decompositions_and_Tractable_Queries","44329868_Algorithmic_graph_theory_and_perfect_graphs_Martin_Charles_Golumbic","3798534_An_algorithm_for_tree-query_membership_of_a_distributed_query","2439356_Query_Evaluation_Via_Tree-Decompositions"]}
