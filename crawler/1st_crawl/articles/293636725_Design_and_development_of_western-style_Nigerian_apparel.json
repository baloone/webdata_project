{"id":"293636725_Design_and_development_of_western-style_Nigerian_apparel","abstract":"This study focused on developing a western-style collection incorporating Ankara textiles for Nigerian women of varying body shapes. The collection was specifically designed for women participating in formal social events. The Functional, Expressive, Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs model provided the conceptual framework for the study [Lamb, J., & Kallal, M. (1992). A conceptual framework for apparel design. Clothing and Textile Research Journal, 10(2), 42–47]. During Phase One of the study, 113 Nigerian women responded to an online survey. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 55, with the majority ages 25–35 years. Respondents reviewed preliminary designs; their responses influenced refinements in the final designs. Phase Two included design refinements, creation of three final designs, and an exhibition. Based on respondents’ comments, the final designs emphasised fit, comfort, and modesty with a strong influence on Nigerian culture. This study demonstrates the applicability of the FEA model in designing culturally inspired apparel.","authors":["Oluwatosin Adelaja","Carol Salusso","Catherine Black"],"meta":["February 2016International Journal of Fashion Design Technology and Education 9(3):1-7","DOI:10.1080/17543266.2016.1141237"],"references":["292858192_Dressing_Somali_Some_Assembly_Required","247644297_African_American_Women's_Satisfaction_with_the_Design_and_Marketing_of_Ready-to-Wear_Clothing","241711186_Application_of_the_Functional_Expressive_and_Aesthetic_Consumer_Needs_Model_Assessing_the_clothing_needs_of_adolescent_girls_with_disabilities","241711183_Assessing_functional_and_aesthetics_clothing_needs_of_young_male_tennis_players","275691519_Nigerian_dress_as_a_symbolic_language","263155878_Prototype_development_of_golf_wear_for_mature_women","262862403_The_Spectacle_of_Aso_Ebi_in_Lagos_1990-2008","260411414_Ethnicity_body_shape_differences_and_female_consumers'_apparel_fit_problems","247783759_Sailing_Apparel_for_Women_A_Design_Development_Case_Study","247783604_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Apparel_Design"]}
