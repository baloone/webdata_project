{"id":"313022793_A_simulation_tool_as_a_support_for_teaching_the_concepts_of_urban_traffic_flow","abstract":"The teaching experience has shown that some key concepts in the study of traffic flow are unintuitive which means their application to major problems is highly complex for students. Therefore, simulation software of traffic in urban environments has been proposed that only requires a small number of easily obtainable input variables.","authors":["Felipe Jiménez Alonso","Sergio Monzón"],"meta":["March 2017Computer Applications in Engineering Education 25(2)","DOI:10.1002/cae.21800"],"references":["299345765_Design_and_implementation_of_an_interactive_virtual_control_laboratory_using_haptic_interface_for_undergraduate_engineering_students","262870137_Classroom_Simulation_of_Cooperative_Engineering_Design_Practice_in_an_Aeronautical_Company","259688733_An_Urban_Traffic_Flow_Model_to_Capture_Complex_Flow_Interactions_among_Lane_Groups_for_Signalized_Intersections","242229622_Computer_Models_for_Education_on_Performance_Monitoring_and_Diagnostics_of_Gas_Turbines","2584087_Microscopic_Simulation_Of_Urban_Traffic_Based_On_Cellular_Automata","321559866_Intersections_without_Traffic_Signals_II_Proceedings_of_an_International_Workshop_18-19_July_1991_in_Bochum_Germany","302971656_A_heterogeneous_traffic_flow_model_consisting_of_two_types_of_vehicles_with_different_sensitivities","299493850_A_cellular_automata_traffic_flow_model_considering_the_heterogeneity_of_acceleration_and_delay_probability","297259571_VirtualMeshLab_Virtual_Laboratory_for_Teaching_Wireless_Mesh_Network","289231465_Multidisciplinary_practicais_in_satellite_navigation_systems_in_road_vehicles_for_subjects_taught_in_different_engineering_schools","272922568_OPTIMIZACION_DE_CONSUMO_DE_COMBUSTIBLE_DE_VEHICULOS_BASADA_EN_PROGRAMACION_DINAMICA","272910180_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Urban_Traffic_Signals","264967532_A_study_of_traffic_capacity","264438620_On-line_driver_type_classification","264222639_Highway_design_software_as_support_of_a_project-based_learning_course","264086936_Modeling_the_Driving_Behavior_of_Electric_Vehicles_Using_Smartphones_and_Neural_Networks","257424654_A_multi-class_traffic_flow_model_-_An_extension_of_LWR_model_with_heterogeneous_drivers","250073422_ROAD_TRAFFIC_CONSIDERED_AS_A_RANDOM_SERIES_INCLUDES_PLATES","245494291_A_study_of_present_use_and_usefulness_of_computer-based_learning_at_a_technical_university","242932955_Average_Delay_at_an_Unsignalized_Intersection_with_Two_Major_Streams_Each_Having_a_Dichotomized_Headway_Distribution","242930388_Car-Following_and_Steady-State_Theory_for_Noncongested_Traffic","242930207_An_Analysis_of_Traffic_Flow","238167476_A_study_of_traffic_capacity","230453827_SIMPERF_SIMULINK_based_educational_software_for_vehicle's_performance_estimation","230323430_Development_and_use_of_vehicle_dynamics_simulation_software_as_support_for_Road_Vehicles_Theory_teaching","229902835_Simulation_Software_for_Teaching_Dynamic_System_Behavior","229886889_Modeling_an_immersive_VR_driving_learning_platform_in_a_web-based_collaborative_design_environment","229780362_Generation_of_a_Virtual_Reality-Based_Automotive_Driving_Training_System_for_CAD_Education","229652265_Educational_Software_Program_for_Teaching_Modal_Testing","229472855_AUTOMATH_MATLAB-based_educational_software_for_vehicle's_performance_and_longitudinal_dynamics","224010978_Shock_Waves_on_the_Highway","222838604_A_kinematic_wave_theory_of_lane-changing_traffic_flow","222690658_Look-ahead_control_for_heavy_trucks_to_minimize_trip_time_and_fuel_consumption","222495203_Car-following_A_historical_review","222430943_Student_perceived_effectiveness_of_computer_technology_use_in_post-secondary_classrooms","222136042_An_alternative_model_in_traffic_flow_equations","30837872_Graphical_user_interfaces_in_an_engineering_educational_environment"]}
