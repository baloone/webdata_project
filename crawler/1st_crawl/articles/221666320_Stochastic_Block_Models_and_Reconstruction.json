{"id":"221666320_Stochastic_Block_Models_and_Reconstruction","abstract":"The planted partition model (also known as the stochastic blockmodel) is a\nclassical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been extensively\nstudied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the\nplanted partition model is a model for random graphs on $n$ nodes with two\nequal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of $q$ and a\nwithin-class edge probability of $p$. Although most of the literature on this\nmodel has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie.\\ $pn, qn \\to \\infty$\nas $n \\to \\infty$), the sparse case $p, q = O(1/n)$ is interesting both from a\nmathematical and an applied point of view.\nA striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\\'a based on\ndeep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for\nthe algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model.\nIn particular, if $p = a/n$ and $q = b/n$, then Decelle et al.\\ conjectured\nthat it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if\n$(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$, and impossible if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. By\ncomparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed\nthat clustering is possible if $(a - b)^2 > C (a + b)$ for some sufficiently\nlarge $C$.\nWe prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to\ncluster if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. Furthermore we show that it is impossible\neven to estimate the model parameters from the graph when $(a - b)^2 < 2(a +\nb)$; on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for\nestimating $a$ and $b$ when $(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$. Following Decelle et al,\nour work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem,\nspin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction\nproblem. This connection points to fascinating applications and open problems.","authors":["Elchanan Mossel","Joe Neeman","Allan Sly"],"meta":["February 2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228057669_Eigenvalues_and_Graph_Bisection_an_Average_Case_Analysis","227334923_Estimation_and_Prediction_for_Stochastic_Blockmodels_for_Graphs_with_Latent_Block_Structure","221804803_Asymptotic_analysis_of_the_stochastic_block_model_for_modular_networks_and_its_algorithmic_applications","51628181_Inference_and_Phase_Transitions_in_the_Detection_of_Modules_in_Sparse_Networks","45928502_Spectral_clustering_and_the_high-dimensional_stochastic_blockmodel","2392143_Broadcasting_on_Trees_and_the_Ising_Model","2361451_Hill-Climbing_Finds_Random_Planted_Bisections","256512934_The_solution_of_some_random_NP-hard_problems_in_polynomial_expected_time","247650049_Stochastic_Blockmodels_First_Steps","243780149_Basics_in_Blackbox_Combinatorial_Optimization","242478759_Models_of_Random_Regular_Graphs","234810997_Topics_in_black-box_combinatorial_optimization","226205967_On_the_purity_of_limiting_Gibbs_state_for_the_Ising_model_on_the_Bethe_lattice","222607067_Binomial_approximation_to_the_Poisson_binomial_distribution","222057470_Some_Simplified_NP-Complete_Graph_Problems","221498587_Graph_Bisection_Algorithms_with_Good_Average_Case_Behavior","220568034_The_Metropolis_Algorithm_for_Graph_Bisection","220345592_Almost_All_Regular_Graphs_Are_Hamiltonian","220138965_Graph_partitioning_via_adaptive_spectral_techniques","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","43020118_Community_Detection_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Analysis","40027400_A_nonparametric_view_of_network_models_and_Newman-Girvan_and_other_modularities","38366575_The_Poisson_Approximation_to_the_Poisson_Binomial_Distribution","38365450_A_Limit_Theorem_for_Multidimensional_Galton-Watson_Processes","3921094_Spectral_Partitioning_of_Random_Graphs","2386539_Algorithms_for_Graph_Partitioning_on_the_Planted_Partition_Model"]}
