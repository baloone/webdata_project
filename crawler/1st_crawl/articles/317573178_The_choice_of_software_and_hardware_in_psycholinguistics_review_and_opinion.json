{"id":"317573178_The_choice_of_software_and_hardware_in_psycholinguistics_review_and_opinion","abstract":"In recent years, several software have been designed to aid in the development of experiments in cognitive sciences. The offer of user-friendly software should help beginners in their initial studies; however, it has brought new problems and questions. Which software should one use? Which one is more appropriate for my research and why? The present paper brings a quick and panoramic review of computer science, programming languages, and the presentation of visual stimuli. Through these three topics, I intend to promote a discussion (i) on the main types of software for stimulation in cognitive sciences, (ii) on the importance of being attentive to the hardware specifications, and (iii) on some compatibility issues between software-hardware methods as independent variables in our experiments.","authors":["Thiago Oliveira da Motta Sampaio"],"meta":["June 2017Revista de Estudos da Linguagem 25(3):971","DOI:10.17851/2237-2083.25.3.971-1010"],"references":["312206140_A_manifesto_for_reproducible_science","305734192_Coercao_Aspectual_Uma_Abordagem_Linguistica_da_Percepcao_do_Tempo","281358655_Correction_Just_Another_Tool_for_Online_Studies_JATOS_An_Easy_Solution_for_Setup_and_Management_of_Web_Servers_Supporting_Online_Studies","275266229_Advances_in_modern_mental_chronometry","273455182_Psychophysics_in_a_Web_browser_Comparing_response_times_collected_with_JavaScript_and_Psychophysics_Toolbox_in_a_visual_search_task","267983125_Julia_A_Fresh_Approach_to_Numerical_Computing","312912095_Handbook_of_Perception_and_Human_Performance","304146457_What's_new_in_Psychtoolbox-3","279233917_Experimentelle_Studien_uber_das_Sehen_von_Bewegung","273637860_A_Timely_Reminder_About_Stimulus_Display_Times_and_Other_Presentation_Parameters_on_CRTs_and_Newer_Technologies","262932398_Presentation_and_response_timing_accuracy_in_Adobe_Flash_and_HTML5JavaScript_Web_experiments","260716641_PsyPad_A_platform_for_visual_psychophysics_on_the_iPad","259653614_Measuring_Software_Timing_Errors_in_the_Presentation_of_Visual_Stimuli_in_Cognitive_Neuroscience_Experiments","261221973_jsPsych_A_JavaScript_library_for_creating_behavioral_experiments_in_a_Web_browser","260296789_E-prime_User's_Guide"]}
