{"id":"324797212_On-The-Fly_Service_Construction_with_Prototypes","abstract":"In spite of the enormous attention that automated service composition has attracted in the recent past, and the large number of approaches that has been developed, these approaches are rarely put into practice and deployed for real-world problems.\nIn light of the increasing demand for an automated construction of services in various domains, this is a somewhat surprising observation. In fact, in domains such as automated machine learning and cloud gaming, both users and providers of software are highly interested in running services that are created in an on-the-fly manner.\nThis paper makes two contributions. First, we provide a framework that is able to create running services from simple queries specifiable by end-users. Our focus is less on the composition algorithm but more on infrastructural aspects that arise when trying to obtain an executable artifact. Second, to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of the framework, we instantiate it for three highly heterogeneous domains: automated machine learning, cloud gaming, and information integration. By putting automated composition into practice, our approach thus goes beyond existing, entirely model-based service composition techniques. Implementations of the framework and its instantiations are public.","authors":["Felix Mohr","Marcel Wever","Eyke HÃ¼llermeier"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1109/SCC.2018.00036","Conference: IEEE International Confierence on Services Computing (IEEE SCC) 2018At: San Francisco, CA, USA","Project: CRC 901 \"On-The-Fly Computing\""],"references":["289173146_On-The-Fly_Computing_A_novel_paradigm_for_individualized_IT_services","262238679_GamingAnywhere_The_first_open_source_cloud_gaming_system","230700205_Auto-WEKA_Combined_Selection_and_Hyperparameter_Optimization_ofClassification_Algorithms","228711042_Semantic_Web_service_composition_planning_with_OWLS-XPlan","221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","221466847_Automating_DAML-S_web_services_composition_using_SHOP2","221156147_Evaluation_of_Service_Composition_Planning_with_OWLS-XPlan","221050338_Automatic_Composition_of_E-services_That_Export_Their_Behavior","220789518_Delta-Oriented_Programming_of_Software_Product_Lines","220543367_Message-Based_Web_Service_Composition_Integrity_Constraints_and_Planning_under_Uncertainty_A_New_Connection","27464173_Quality_driven_Web_services_composition","333183092_TPOT_A_Tree-Based_Pipeline_Optimization_Tool_for_Automating_Machine_Learning","324442759_Automated_software_and_service_composition_A_survey_and_evaluating_review","319395635_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","305775749_SpringerBriefs_in_Computer_Science","305685652_Evaluation_of_a_Tree-based_Pipeline_Optimization_Tool_for_Automating_Data_Science","301822555_Efficient_and_robust_automated_machine_learning","278657653_Optimal_and_Automatic_Transactional_Web_Service_Composition_with_Dependency_Graph_and_0-1_Linear_Programming","276913111_Automated_Online_Service_Composition","271131716_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","264437608_Learning_Service_Recommendations","261960832_Docker_lightweight_Linux_containers_for_consistent_development_and_deployment","242529698_SWORD_A_developer_toolkit_for_Web_service_composition","235720510_Web_Services_Choreography_Description_Language_Version_10","221106042_Web_Agents_Cooperating_Deductively"]}
