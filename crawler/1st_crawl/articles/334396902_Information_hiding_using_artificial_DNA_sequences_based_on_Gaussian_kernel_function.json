{"id":"334396902_Information_hiding_using_artificial_DNA_sequences_based_on_Gaussian_kernel_function","abstract":"Cryptography is one of the major concerned areas of computer networks and data security. An efficient direction of providing data security can be termed as DNA based on cryptography. In this paper, a new reliable and more secure approach for data hiding based on DNA sequences is introduced. The proposed approach has two rounds of encryption. This encryption is similar to an existing encryption method called the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. Through cryptography algorithm two secret keys are used for encryption the message. The first key is induced from the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and gaussian kernel function (GKF). The second key is constructed based on an arbitrary injective mapping on the second characters repeated in the first key. Finally, the encryption message randomly hides in the second DNA sequence based on the numbers from GKF.","authors":["Mahmoud I Moussa","Eman I.
