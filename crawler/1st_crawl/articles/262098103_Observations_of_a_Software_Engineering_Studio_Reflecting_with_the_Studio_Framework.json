{"id":"262098103_Observations_of_a_Software_Engineering_Studio_Reflecting_with_the_Studio_Framework","abstract":"Studio-based learning for software engineering is a well-received concept, despite its apparent lack of uptake across institutions worldwide. Studio education affords a variety of highly desirable benefits, and is also popular amongst its students. This paper presents Lancaster Universityâ€™s software engineering studio, details of its implementation, observations made throughout its first year, evidence of its successes, and reflections against the recently defined studio framework . This paper aims to provide useful information for anyone that is considering utilizing a studio-based approach.","authors":["Christopher Neil Bull","Jon Whittle"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816784","Conference: 27th IEEE Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T 2014)At: Klagenfurt, Austria","Project: Studios in Software Engineering Education (PhD)"],"references":["261248065_Using_continuous_integration_of_code_and_content_to_teach_software_engineering_with_limited_resources","236165289_Studios_in_Software_Engineering_Education_Towards_an_Evaluable_Model","312532676_What_is_participant_observation","305295593_Teaching_software_development_in_a_studio_environment","274366487_Hard_Living_on_Clay_Street_Portraits_of_Blue_Collar_Families","269437465_Hard_Living_on_Clay_Street_Portraits_of_Blue_Collar_Families","262352952_Food_and_drink_in_computer_labs_why_not","262330598_A_review_of_studio-based_learning_in_computer_science","254007409_Transforming_the_CS_classroom_with_studio-based_learning","222855008_Design_knowledge_communicated_in_studio_critiques"]}
