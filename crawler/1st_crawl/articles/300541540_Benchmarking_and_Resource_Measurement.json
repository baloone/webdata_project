{"id":"300541540_Benchmarking_and_Resource_Measurement","abstract":"Proper benchmarking and resource measurement is an important topic, because benchmarking is a widely-used method for the comparative evaluation of tools and algorithms in many research areas. It is essential for researchers, tool developers, and users, as well as for competitions. We formulate a set of requirements that are indispensable for reproducible benchmarking and reliable resource measurement of automatic solvers, verifiers, and similar tools, and discuss limitations of existing methods and benchmarking tools. Fulfilling these requirements in a benchmarking framework is complex and can (on Linux) currently only be done by using the cgroups feature of the kernel. We provide\n, a ready-to-use, tool-independent, and free implementation of a benchmarking framework that fulfills all presented requirements, making reproducible benchmarking and reliable resource measurement easy. Our framework is able to work with a wide range of different tools and has proven its reliability and usefulness in the International Competition on Software Verification.","authors":["Dirk Beyer","Stefan LÃ¶we","Philipp Wendler"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-23404-5_12","In book: Model Checking Software (pp.160-178)"],"references":["220938759_Producing_Wrong_Data_Without_Doing_Anything_Obviously_Wrong","220163331_Controlling_a_Solver_Execution_the_runsolver_Tool","2954925_Should_Computer_Scientists_Experiment_More","311474956_Producing_wrong_data_without_doing_anything_obviously_wrong","308731375_BenchKit_a_Tool_for_Massive_Concurrent_Benchmarking","283653456_Software_verification_and_verifiable_witnesses_Report_on_SV-COMP_2015","266984900_StarExec_A_Cross-Community_Infrastructure_for_Logic_Solving","262601559_Software_Verification_in_the_Google_App-Engine_Cloud","258513864_VCWC_A_Versioning_Competition_Workflow_Compiler","257578162_6_Years_of_SMT-COMP","235246921_Reproducible_Network_Experiments_using_Container_Based_Emulation","228965606_Containers_Challenges_with_the_memory_resource_controller_and_its_performance"]}
