{"id":"283571516_An_Approach_to_Generate_2-Dimensional_AVK_to_Enhance_Security_of_Shared_Information","abstract":"As the sharing of information through the communication channels increases, the indispensability of maintaining confidentiality of those shared information also increases proportionally. Providing reasonable security over the insecure channel is a challenging research. Due to the advancement of computational efficiency, confidentiality of the information cannot be assured with the help of a static key. Keeping this in mind, many researchers have proposed several time variant key generation techniques, out of which Automatic Variable Key (AVK) is a novel approach. In conventional AVK and in different variations of AVK; the key varies every time as new data is exchanged between sender and receiver while the key size remains constant throughout the data communication. Therefore, to increase the randomness among the successive keys that is the key for ensuring the greater security, we have proposed a 2-dimensional AVK in which the auto generated keys not only vary in bits sequence (i.e. session by session) but also in size.","authors":["Manash Pratim Dutta","Subhasish Banerjee","Chandan Bhunia"],"meta":["October 2015International Journal of Security and its Applications 9(10):147-154","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.10.13"],"references":["323805110_Key_variation_technique_based_on_piggybacking_strategies_under_public_key_environments","305801381_A_Novel_Approach_to_Achieve_the_Perfect_Security_through_AVK_over_Insecure_Communication_Channel","289522580_Generation_of_Variable_Session_Keys_Based_on_Piggybacking_Strategy","283571440_Absolute_key_variation_technique_of_automatic_variable_key_in_cryptography","283571353_Two_New_Schemes_to_Generate_Automatic_Variable_Key_AVK_to_achieve_the_Perfect_Security_in_Insecure_Communication_Channel","272010140_New_Techniques_for_Generating_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_in_Achieving_Perfect_Security","263578074_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_under_Various_Approaches_in_Cryptography_System","261851889_New_Approach_towards_Generation_of_Automatic_Variable_Key_to_Achieve_Perfect_Security","242101903_A_novel_approach_towards_realizing_optimum_data_transfer_and_Automatic_Variable_KeyAVK_in_cryptography","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication"]}
