{"id":"324766886_Shortest_path_finding_in_geographical_information_systems_using_node_combination_and_dijkstra_algorithm","abstract":"The problem of finding the shortest route as one of the fundamental case studies in the field of computer science is quite challenging, especially if it involves large variables. Manual calculations will be difficult to obtain optimal solutions in a short time, even just for one destination. In this article, we discussed a combination of node combination algorithms and Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from one point to another on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based systems. This combination allows the use of memory during the route search process can be reduced, in addition to the solution obtained can be ascertained is the optimal solution with the shortest route. The data used in this research is obtained from the map location in Taman Subdistrict, Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia, with the number of nodes as many as 17 pieces and 72 vertices. Distance spacing is calculated based on the value of latitude and longitude obtained from the Google Maps API.","authors":["Achmad Fitro","O.S. Bachri","A.I. Sulistio Purnomo","I.
