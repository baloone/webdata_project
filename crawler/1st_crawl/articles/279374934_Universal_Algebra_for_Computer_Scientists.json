{"id":"279374934_Universal_Algebra_for_Computer_Scientists","abstract":"In the last few years the applications of universal algebra in theoretical computer science have increased more and more. Most of them deal with formal semantics. By splitting the syntactic and semantic part of a data type, a program or any other object of interest, universal algebra provides methods to define and argue about semantics in a suitable formal framework. The basic idea is simple. All operation symbols involved in the syntactic description of our objects are interpreted as operations in an algebra. Semantics is then definable as a model class. However, the crucial point is that such model classes only become manageable if we are able to select “standard models”. As we shall see, free or initial algebras play this role.","authors":["Wolfgang Wechler"],"meta":["January 1992","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-76771-5_4","In book: Universal Algebra for Computer Scientists (pp.243-295)"],"references":[]}
