{"id":"337094009_Towards_a_New_Data_Replication_Management_in_Cloud_Systems","abstract":"Applications produce huge volumes of data that are distributed on remote and heterogeneous sites. This generates problems related to access and sharing data. As a result, managing data in large-scale environments is a real challenge. In this context, large-scale data management systems often use data replication, a well-known technique that treats generated problems by storing multiple copies of data, called replicas, across multiple nodes. Most of the replication strategies in these environments are difficult to adapt to cloud environments. They aim to achieve the best performance of the system without meeting the important objectives of the cloud provider. This article proposes a new dynamic replication strategy. The proposed algorithm significantly improves provider gain without neglecting customer satisfaction.","authors":["Abdennour Lazeb","Riad Mokadem","Ghalem Belalem"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal of Strategic Information Technology and Applications 10(2):1-20","DOI:10.4018/IJSITA.2019040101","Project: Towards a new model of storage and access to data in Big Data and Cloud Computing"],"references":["330169917_Data_replication_strategy_with_satisfaction_of_availability_performance_and_tenant_budget_requirements","321805118_Ensuring_performance_and_provider_profit_through_data_replication_in_cloud_systems","318519992_A_quorum-based_intelligent_replicas_management_in_data_grids_to_improve_performances","312962666_Cost_Optimization_for_Dynamic_Replication_and_Migration_of_Data_in_Cloud_Data_Centers","303395221_Data_Sets_Replicas_Placements_Strategy_from_Cost-Effective_View_in_the_Cloud","322514886_QuAD_A_quorum_protocol_for_adaptive_data_management_in_the_cloud","319588752_Towards_Cost_Reduction_in_Cloud-Based_Workflow_Management_through_Data_Replication","312484084_A_Performance_and_Profit_Oriented_Data_Replication_Strategy_for_Cloud_Systems","308864116_Location-aware_data_replication_in_cloud_computing_systems","304356206_Adaptive_data_replication_strategy_in_cloud_computing_for_performance_improvement"]}
