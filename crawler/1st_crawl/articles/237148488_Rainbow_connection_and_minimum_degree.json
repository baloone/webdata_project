{"id":"237148488_Rainbow_connection_and_minimum_degree","abstract":"An edge-coloured graph G is rainbow connected if any two vertices are connected by a path whose edges have distinct colours. The rainbow connection number of a connected graph G, denoted rc (G), is the smallest number of colours that are needed in order to make G rainbow connected. M. Krivelevich and R. Yuster [J. Graph Theory 63, No. 3, 185–191 (2010; Zbl 1193.05079)] have shown that a connected graph G with n vertices has rc (G)<20n δ(G). In this paper we prove that a connected graph G with n vertices has rc (G)<4n δ(G)+1+4.","authors":["Ingo Schiermeyer"],"meta":["August 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(12):1784-1787","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2011.10.009"],"references":["268518108_On_forbidden_subgraphs_and_rainbow_connection_in_graphs_with_minimum_degree_2","221563877_Rainbow_Connection_in_Graphs_with_Minimum_Degree_Three","220468963_Graphs_with_rainbow_connection_number_two","220342507_On_Rainbow_Connection","268496917_Rainbow_connection_in_graphs","220549038_The_Rainbow_Connection_of_a_Graph_Is_at_Most_Reciprocal_to_Its_Minimum_Degree"]}
