{"id":"325632511_Semantic_Query_System_for_Moodle_Virtual_Courses_Based_on_an_Ontology","abstract":"This paper presents a semantic query system which permits obtaining information from a virtual course by means of an ontology. It also introduces ontologies of a domain for a virtual course that is composed of concepts and properties represented in a Moodle virtual learning environment. The Noy & McGuinness methodology was used to carry out the process of designing the ontologies. Likewise, the agile methodology Scrum was used for the development of the semantic query application, which was implemented by utilizing the J2EE platform in combination with the JENA framework. Ultimately, to validate the implemented system, a usability test was conducted to potential users. The results of the investigation show a relatively reliable internal data consistency. Based on the observed evidence, it was determined that the application for semantic query was easy to use and navigation was suitable. The results regarding the information resulting from the participants were perceived as satisfactory.","authors":["Danilo Pástor","Gloria Arcos Medina","Alejandra Onate","Mayra Loaiza"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICEDEG.2018.8372309","Conference: 2018 Fifth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG)","Project: Propuesta de un modelo para el proceso de diseño educativo usando tecnologías de la web semántica para sistemas de gestión de aprendizaje"],"references":["318773681_NISO_Z3996-201x_jats_Journal_article_tag_suite","273319765_WEB_SEMANTICA_MAS_DE_UNA_DECADA_DE_SU_APARICION","261309269_Using_semantics_in_INES_an_Intelligent_Educational_System","261265752_Ontology_of_moodle_e-learning_system_for_social_network_analysis","254052151_E-Course_Ontology_for_Developing_E-Learning_Courses","232088550_Semantic_web_technologies_for_education_-_time_for_a_'turn_to_practice'_INTRODUCTION","221176041_Finding_Appropriate_Learning_Objects_An_Empirical_Evaluation","200043063_OWL_Web_Ontology_Language_Reference","319822022_Introduction_to_Web-Based_Education","319041502_A_systematic_literature_review_of_the_use_of_Semantic_Web_technologies_in_formal_education","303507426_ELSE_an_ontology-based_system_integrating_semantic_search_and_e-learning_technologies","300915372_Ontology-based_Learning_Object_Searching_Technique_with_Granular_Feature_Extraction","251291243_A_Web_of_Data_Toward_the_Idea_of_the_Semantic_Web","238677818_Extensible_markup_language_xml_1","200166280_Pedagogically_Founded_Courseware_Generation_for_Web-Based_Learning_--_An_HTN-Planning-Based_Approach_Implemented_in_PAIGOS"]}
