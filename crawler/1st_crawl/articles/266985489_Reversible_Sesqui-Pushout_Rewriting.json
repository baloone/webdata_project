{"id":"266985489_Reversible_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","abstract":"The paper proposes a variant of sesqui-pushout rewriting (SqPO) that allows one to develop the theory of nested application conditions (NACs) for arbitrary rule spans; this is a considerable generalisation compared with existing results for NACs, which only hold for linear rules (with respect to a suitable class of monos). Besides this main contribution, namely an adapted shifting construction for NACs, the paper presents a uniform commutativity result for a revised notion of independence that applies to arbitrary rules; these theorems hold in any category with (enough) stable pushouts and a class of monos rendering it weak adhesive HLR. To illustrate results and concepts, we use simple graphs, i.e. the category of binary endorelations and relation preserving functions, as it is a paradigmatic example of a category with stable pushouts; moreover, using regular monos to give semantics to NACs, we can shift NACs over arbitrary rule spans.","authors":["Vincent Danos","Tobias Heindel","Ricardo Honorato-Zimmer","Sandro Stucki"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-09108-2_11","Conference: International Conference on Graph Transformation"],"references":["303547092_Double-pushout_graph_transformation_revisited","262208090_Pattern_Graphs_and_Rule-Based_Models_The_Semantics_of_Kappa","221550752_Unfolding_Grammars_in_Adhesive_Categories","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","220713176_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_-_Part_I_Basic_Concepts_and_Double_Pushout_Approach","220713154_Local_Confluence_for_Rules_with_Nested_Application_Conditions","288802473_Graphs_rewriting_and_pathway_reconstruction_for_rule-based_models","262217101_Refined_graph_rewriting_in_span-categories_a_framework_for_algebraic_graph_transformation","242982550_Exponentiable_morphisms_partial_products_and_pullback_complements","233971615_Categorical_Frameworks_for_Graph_Transformation_and_HLR_Systems_based_on_the_DPO_Approach"]}
