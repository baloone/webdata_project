Meanwhile, problem-based learning (PBL) situate learning in complex tasks. Such task require scaffolding to help students engage in sense making, managing their investigations, problem-solving processes, and encouraging students to articulate their thinking and reflect on their learning. This study aimed to develop four scaffolding modules for collaborative problem-based learning through the computer network on Moodle LMS for the computer programming course of undergraduate students, and to analyze the satisfaction of the experts and students after using the developed scaffolding modules. The four scaffolding modules consisted of metacognitive scaffolding, conceptual scaffolding, strategic scaffolding, and procedural scaffolding, each of which represented by a 3-D animation expert cartoon to attract students. The sample group were twenty-two students of small group pilot and six experts. The findings indicated that the degree of satisfaction towards the scaffolding from the experts was high and the degree of the satisfaction towards the scaffolding from the students was also high. This can be used the four scaffolding modules to complete PBL task successfully.","authors":["Monchai Tiantong","Sanit Teemueangsa"],"meta":["April 2013International Education Studies 6(5)","DOI:10.5539/ies.v6n5p47"],"references":["255669112_An_Evaluation_of_Scaffolding_for_Virtual_Interactive_Tutorials","237035032_Open_Learning_Environments_Foundations_methods_and_models","225616353_A_conceptual_framework_for_scaffolding_III-structured_problem-solving_processes_using_question_prompts_and_peer_interactions","32231175_The_Social_and_Technological_Dimensions_of_Scaffolding_and_Related_Theoretical_Concepts_for_Learning_Education_and_Human_Activity","14751207_Problem-based_learning_A_review_of_literature_on_its_outcomes_and_implementation_issues","264268100_Problem_Based_Learning","249342215_The_evolution_of_constructivist_learning_environments_Immersion_in_distributed_virtual_worlds","247522424_Hypertext_Principles_for_Text_and_Courseware_Design","245968667_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Its_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Issues","241712841_Scaffolding_Instruction_for_English_Language_Learners_A_Conceptual_Framework","237626588_Cognitive_apprenticeship_in_educational_practice_Research_on_scaffolding_modeling_mentoring_and_coaching_as_instructional_strategies","232534957_Scaffolding_student_learning_Instructional_approaches_and_issues_Advances_in_learning_teaching","230876708_Problem-Based_Learning_An_Approach_to_Medical_Education","226234968_The_effects_of_argumentation_scaffolds_on_argumentation_and_problem_solving","35494373_The_Big_Six_Information_Skills_as_a_metacognitive_scaffold_in_solving_information_based_problems","30873350_Context_and_Consciousness_Activity_Theory_in_Human-Computer_Interaction"]}
