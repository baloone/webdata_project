{"id":"257200993_Threshold_saturation_for_spatially_coupled_LDPC_and_LDGM_codes_on_BMS_channels","abstract":"Spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which were first\nintroduced as LDPC convolutional codes, have been shown to exhibit excellent\nperformance under low-complexity belief-propagation decoding. This phenomenon\nis now termed threshold saturation via spatial coupling. Spatially-coupled\ncodes have been successfully applied in numerous areas. In particular, it is\nnow proven that spatially-coupled regular LDPC codes universally achieve\ncapacity over the class of binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels under\nbelief-propagation decoding.\nRecently, potential functions have been used to simplify threshold saturation\nproofs for scalar and vector recursions. In this paper, potential functions are\nused to prove threshold saturation for irregular LDPC and low-density\ngenerator-matrix (LDGM) codes on BMS channels. This shows that the simplified\nproof techniques introduced for scalar recursions can be extended to BMS\nchannels. The required potential functions are closely related to average Bethe\nfree energy of the ensembles in the large-system limit. The same functions also\nappear in statistical physics when the replica method is used to analyze\noptimal decoding.","authors":["Santhosh Kumar","Andrew J.
