{"id":"234082964_Secrecy_Capacity_of_Two-Hop_Relay_Assisted_Wiretap_Channels","abstract":"Incorporating the physical layer characteristics to secure communications has\nreceived considerable attention in recent years. Moreover, cooperation with\nsome nodes of network can give benefits of multiple-antenna systems, increasing\nthe secrecy capacity of such channels. In this paper, we consider cooperative\nwiretap channel with the help of an Amplify and Forward (AF) relay to transmit\nconfidential messages from source to legitimate receiver in the presence of an\neavesdropper. In this regard, the secrecy capacity of AF relying is derived,\nassuming the relay is subject to a peak power constraint. To this end, an\nachievable secrecy rate for Gaussian input is evaluated through solving a\nnon-convex optimization problem. Then, it is proved that any rates greater than\nthis secrecy rate is not achievable. To do this, the capacity of a genie-aided\nchannel as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity of the underlying channel is\nderived, showing this upper bound is equal to the computed achievable secrecy\nrate with Gaussian input. Accordingly, the corresponding secrecy capacity is\ncompared to the Decode and Forward (DF) strategy which is served as the\nbenchmark in the current work.","authors":["Meysam Mirzaee","Soroush Akhlaghi"],"meta":["June 2017Wireless Personal Communications 94(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-016-3754-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224604885_Relay_Selection_for_Secure_Cooperative_Networks_with_Jamming","224320161_Achievable_Rates_in_Gaussian_MISO_Channels_with_Secrecy_Constraints","224249296_The_Secrecy_Capacity_of_the_MIMO_Wiretap_Channel","311396077_User_cooperation_diversity_part_i_System_description","265434209_Descartes'_Rule_of_Signs_Revisited","242589487_The_Wire-tap_Channel","241138434_Network_Information_Flow","238260856_Lectures_on_Wiener_and_Kalman_Filtering","227242297_Maximization_of_the_Ratio_of_Two_Convex_Quadratic_Functions_over_a_Polytope","226553133_Optimization_of_Polynomial_Fractional_Functions","224230541_Opportunistic_Relaying_for_Secrecy_Communications_Cooperative_Jamming_vs_Relay_Chatting","224183731_Secure_transmission_with_multiple_antennas-part_II_The_MIMOME_wiretap_channel","224241955_On_Cooperative_Relaying_Schemes_for_Wireless_Physical_Layer_Security","224224730_The_Secrecy_Capacity_Region_of_the_Gaussian_MIMO_Multi-receiver_Wiretap_Channel","224155523_Cooperation_With_an_Untrusted_Relay_A_Secrecy_Perspective"]}
