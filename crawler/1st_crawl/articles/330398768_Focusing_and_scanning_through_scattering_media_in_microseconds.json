{"id":"330398768_Focusing_and_scanning_through_scattering_media_in_microseconds","abstract":"Recent advances in computational wavefront shaping have made optical focusing through scattering media a reality. However, most current techniques are too slow to focus, much less image through dynamically changing living biological tissue, such as blood-perfused neural networks, which can decorrelate in milliseconds. We introduce a phase control technique using programmable acoustic optic deflectors (AODs) that is orders of magnitude faster than existing wavefront shaping methods. It is based on sending an array of RF-encoded beams through the medium and measuring the phases of all scattered beams simultaneously with a fast single-pixel detector in just 10 Î¼s. Using the AODs, we then phase conjugate the beams to form a spatio-temporal focus. We also demonstrate two-dimensional scanning of the focus on a sub-millisecond time scale.","authors":["Daniel Feldkhun","Omer Tzang","Kelvin Wagner","Rafael Piestun"],"meta":["January 2019Optica 6(1):72","DOI:10.1364/OPTICA.6.000072"],"references":["319977279_Focusing_light_through_dynamical_samples_using_fast_closed-loop_wavefront_optimization","283453492_Fast_spatial_beam_shaping_by_acousto-optic_diffraction_for_3D_non-linear_microscopy","280731761_Focusing_through_dynamic_tissue_with_millisecond_digital_optical_phase_conjugation","268819790_Translation_correlations_in_anisotropically_scattering_media","258685892_Controlling_waves_in_space_and_time_for_imaging_and_focusing_in_complex_media","228563168_Calibrating_bead_displacements_in_optical_tweezers_using_acousto-optic_deflectors","26262552_Optical_phase_conjugation_for_turbidity_suppression_in_biological_samples","313852464_Focusing_light_inside_dynamic_scattering_media_with_millisecond_digital_optical_phase_conjugation","309093647_Ocean_rogue_waves_and_their_phase_space_dynamics_in_the_limit_of_a_linear_interference_model","305483556_Single-shot_afocal_three-dimensional_microscopy","292671759_Analyzing_the_relationship_between_decorrelation_time_and_tissue_thickness_in_acute_rat_brain_slices_using_multispeckle_diffusing_wave_spectroscopy","276362112_Feedback-based_wavefront_shaping","221774771_High-speed_scattering_medium_characterization_with_application_to_focusing_light_through_turbid_media","215722103_Some_Fundamental_Properties_of_Speckle","50395860_Parallel_wavefront_optimization_method_for_focusing_light_through_random_scattering_media","49651603_Doppler_encoded_excitation_pattern_tomographic_optical_microscopy","47863001_Focusing_and_Compression_of_Ultrashort_Pulses_through_Scattering_Media","46415051_Image_Transmission_Through_an_Opaque_Material","7363317_Fast_three-dimensional_laser_scanning_scheme_using_acousto-optic_deflectors"]}
