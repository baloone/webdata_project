{"id":"220431711_Universality_of_Tag_Systems_with_P_2","abstract":"By a simple direct construction it is shown that computations done by Turing machines can be duplicated by a very simple symbol manipulation process. The process is described by a simple form of Post canonical system with some very strong restrictions.\nThis system is monogenic : each formula (string of symbols) of the system can be affected by one and only one production (rule of inference) to yield a unique result. Accordingly, if we begin with a single axiom (initial string) the system generates a simply ordered sequence of formulas, and this operation of a monogenic system brings to mind the idea of a machine.\nThe Post canonical system is further restricted to the “Tag” variety, described briefly below. It was shown in [1] that Tag systems are equivalent to Turing machines. The proof in [1] is very complicated and uses lemmas concerned with a variety of two-tape nonwriting Turing machines. The proof here avoids these otherwise interesting machines and strengthens the main result; obtaining the theorem with a best possible deletion number P = 2.\nAlso, the representation of the Turing machine in the present system has a lower degree of exponentiation, which may be of significance in applications.\nThese systems seem to be of value in establishing unsolvability of combinatorial problems.","authors":["John Cocke","Marvin Minsky"],"meta":["January 1964Journal of the ACM 11(1):15-20","DOI:10.1145/321203.321206","SourceDBLP"],"references":["247538411_Size_and_Structure_of_Universal_Turing_Machines_Using_Tag_Systems","238727704_Recursive_Unsolvability_of_Post's_Problem_of_Tag_and_other_Topics_in_Theory_of_Turing_Machines","234789582_Computability_of_Recursive_Functions","220432237_A_Variant_to_Turing's_Theory_of_Computing_Machines"]}
