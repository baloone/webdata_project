{"id":"280852892_Distributed_estimation_of_the_inertial_parameters_of_an_unknown_load_via_multi-robot_manipulation","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed strategy for the estimation of the kinematic and inertial parameters of an unknown body manipulated by a team of mobile robots. We assume that each robot can measure its own velocity, as well as the contact forces exerted during the body manipulation, but neither the accelerations nor the positions of the contact points are directly accessible. Through kinematics and dynamics arguments, the relative positions of the contact points are estimated in a distributed fashion, and an observability condition is defined. Then, the inertial parameters (i.e., mass, relative position of the center of mass and moment of inertia) are estimated using distributed estimation filters and a nonlinear observer in cooperation with suitable control actions that ensure the observability of the parameters. Finally, we provide numerical simulations that corroborate our theoretical analysis.","authors":["Antonio Franchi","Antonio Petitti","Alessandro Rizzo"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/CDC.2014.7040346"],"references":["271549683_On_the_convergence_of_the_max-consensus_protocol_with_asynchronous_updates","263196114_The_Flying_Hand_a_Formation_of_UAVs_for_Cooperative_Aerial_Tele-Manipulation","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","271549722_Geometric_control_of_cooperating_multiple_quadrotor_UAVs_with_a_suspended_payload","262242930_On_the_robust_synthesis_of_logical_consensus_algorithms_for_distributed_intrusion_detection","261353450_Formation-based_approach_for_multi-robot_cooperative_manipulation_based_on_optimal_control_design","261056127_Nonholonomic_cooperative_manipulation_of_polygonal_objects_in_the_plane","257012563_Distributed_centroid_estimation_from_noisy_relative_measurements","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","245954051_Distributed_Algorithms_Chapter_6_7"]}
