{"id":"226760979_Compiler-Directed_Dynamic_Frequency_and_Voltage_Scheduling","abstract":"Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling has been identified as one of the most effective ways to reduce power dissipation. This\npaper discusses a compilation strategy that identifies opportunities for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling of the CPU\nwithout significant increase in overall program execution time. The paper introduces a simple, yet effective performance model\nto determine an effcient CPU slow-down factor for memory bound loop computations. Simulation results of a superscalar target\narchitecture and a program kernel compiled at different optimizations levels show the potential benefit of the proposed compiler\noptimization. The energy savings are reported for a hypothetical target machine with power dissipation characteristics similar\nto Transmeta's Crusoe TM5400 processor.","authors":["Chung-Hsing Hsu","Ulrich Kremer","Michael Hsiao"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44572-2_6","SourceCiteSeer","Conference: Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Power-Aware Computer Systems-Revised Papers"],"references":["241481142_Lockup-free_instruction_fetchprefetch_cache_organization","234791111_The_SimpleScalar_tool_set_version_20","221596588_A_study_of_memory_system_performance_of_multimedia_applications","290964175_Dynamic_voltage_and_frequency_scaling_for_scientific_applications","262493820_Advanced_Compiler_Design_Implementation","248011398_The_SimpleScalar_Tool_Set_Version_2","245593763_Cache_design_tradeoffs_for_power_and_performance_optimization_A_case_study","242602017_Memory_hierarchy_extensions_to_simplescalar_3","222811242_Estimating_Interlock_And_Improving_Balance_For_Pipelined_Architectures","221496798_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Energy_Behavior_of_Iteration_Space_Tiling","220926731_Comparing_Algorithm_for_Dynamic_Speed-Setting_of_a_Low-Power_CPU","221235781_Cache_Performance_for_Multimedia_Applications","221062654_Function-level_power_estimation_methodology_for_microprocessors","221059294_The_design_and_use_of_simplepower_a_cycle-accurate_energy_estimation_tool","220851803_Scheduling_for_Reduced_CPU_Energy"]}
