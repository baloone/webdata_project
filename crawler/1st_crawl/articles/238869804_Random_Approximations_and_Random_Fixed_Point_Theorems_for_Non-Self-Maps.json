{"id":"238869804_Random_Approximations_and_Random_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Non-Self-Maps","abstract":"Recently, Sehgal and Singh [ 18 ] and Papageorgiou [ 16 ] considered different random versions of a very interesting theorem of Fan [ 4 ]. Instead of compact convex domain, here we consider a continuous condensing or non-expansive random map defined on a closed ball (or closed convex set with bounded range). We prove it is true for certain spaces. As applications of our theorems, some random fixed point theorems of non-self-maps are derived.","authors":["Tzu-Chu Lin"],"meta":["August 1988Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 103(4):1129-1129","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9939-1988-0954994-0"],"references":["247589235_Some_Random_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Condensing_Operators","243781915_A_Fixed_Point_Theorem_for_Mappings_which_do_not_Increase_Distances","313090522_Measurable_relations","278949737_APPROXIMATION_THEOREMS_AND_FIXED-POINT_THEOREMS_IN_CONES","265590569_A_note_on_a_theorem_of_Ky_Fan","256245420_Random_fixed_point_theorems_with_an_application_to_random_differential_equations_in_Banach_spaces","246200848_Fixed_point_theorems_in_probabilistic_analysis","243092797_Survey_of_Measurable_Selection_Theorems","243062502_On_Random_Approximations_and_a_Random_Fixed_Point_Theorem_for_Set_Valued_Mappings","243008383_Approximate_selections_best_approximation_fixed_points_and_invariant_sets","239666706_Proximity_Maps_for_Convex_Sets","238869545_Random_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Measurable_Multifunctions_in_Banach_Spaces","231905666_Convex_sets_fixed_points_variational_and_minimax_inequalities","226303740_Extensions_of_two_fixed_point_theorems_of_Ky_Fan","225251088_Extensions_of_two_fixed_point_theorems_of_F_E_Browder","225210304_The_fixed_point_index_for_local_condensing_maps","225203105_Some_properties_of_sets_related_to_fixed_point_theorems","222185068_Applications_of_the_proximity_map_to_fixed_point_theorems_in_Hilbert_space","50334419_Convex_Analysis_and_Measurable_Multifunctions"]}
