{"id":"281329380_Design_Space_Exploration_in_an_FPGA-Based_Software_Defined_Radio","abstract":"The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology is expected to play a key role in the development of Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. To this aim, leveraging the nascent High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, a design flow from high-level specifications to Register-Transfer Level (RTL) description can be thought. Based on such a flow, this paper describes the Design Space Exploration (DSE) that can be achieved using loop optimizations. The mainstream objective is to demonstrate the compile-time flexibility of an architecture when associated with a reconfigurable platform. Throughout both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11g waveform examples, we show how the FPGA resources can be tuned according to a targeted throughput.","authors":["Matthieu Gautier","Ganda Stephane Ouedraogo","Olivier Sentieys"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/DSD.2014.44"],"references":["277683872_Frame-based_Modeling_for_Automatic_Synthesis_of_FPGA-Software_Defined_Radio","257079659_An_FPGA_Software_Defined_Radio_Platform_with_a_High-Level_Synthesis_Design_Flow","228631655_SPEX_A_programming_language_for_software_defined_radio","225173863_Algorithmic-level_Specification_and_Characterization_of_Embedded_Multimedia_Applications_with_Design_Trotter","314816114_A_compiler_approach_to_fast_hardware_design_space_exploration_in_FPGA-based_systems","291001242_Catapult_Synthesis_A_Practical_Introduction_to_Interactive_C_Synthesis","236183261_Part_154_wireless_medium_access_control_MAC_and_physical_layer_PHY_specifications_for_low-rate_wireless_personal_area_networks_LR-WPANs_ANSIIEEE_Std_802154","235779841_Domain-Specific_Languages","224111749_The_Software_Communication_Architecture_specification_Evolution_and_trends","220752133_A_Compiler_Approach_to_Fast_Hardware_Design_Space_Exploration_in_FPGA-based_Systems"]}
