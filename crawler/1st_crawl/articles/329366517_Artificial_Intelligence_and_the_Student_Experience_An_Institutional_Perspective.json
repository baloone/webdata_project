{"id":"329366517_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Student_Experience_An_Institutional_Perspective","abstract":"The paper outlines the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to positively impact student success. This will be approached from a student life-cycle perspective, taking an integrated view of the student experience and identifying where AI can be most beneficial. Current usages of AI in education will be considered, in addition to those being experimented with and those still being considered. The paper will view the adoption of AI in education from a comprehensive perspective, considering technological, social, political, economic, cultural and ethical factors, providing a frame for understanding of the benefits and constraints of the most intelligent of information technology in the educational realm.\n\nAI has started to emerge in educational institutions in the form of chat bots that are being used to provide student services as well as providing learning supports. Automated paper grading has started to be used, while academic advising and assessment are being trialed.","authors":["Kriti Khare","Brian Stewart","Anshuman Khare"],"meta":["December 2018IAFOR Journal of Education 6(3):63-78","DOI:10.22492/ije.6.3.04"],"references":["321807721_A_Constructivist_Perspective_on_Games_in_Education","309851969_Automatic_Features_for_Essay_Scoring_-_An_Empirical_Study","320932467_A_Rule-Based_Self-Learning_Model_for_Automatic_Evaluation_and_Grading_of_C_Programs","320688306_A_meta-analysis_with_examination_of_moderators_of_student_cognition_affect_and_learning_outcomes_while_using_serious_educational_games_serious_games_and_simulations","320140037_Analyzing_productive_learning_behaviors_for_students_using_immediate_corrective_feedback_in_a_blended_learning_environment","319715213_Educational_Data_Mining_EDM_Researching_Impact_on_Online_Business_Education","319394459_Artificial_Intelligence","308857640_Next-term_student_grade_prediction","308760030_Topological_Order_Discovery_via_Deep_Knowledge_Tracing","305277383_Incorporating_Student_Response_Time_and_Tutor_Instructional_Interventions_into_Student_Modeling"]}
