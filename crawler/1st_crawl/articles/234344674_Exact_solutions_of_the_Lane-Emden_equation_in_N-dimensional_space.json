{"id":"234344674_Exact_solutions_of_the_Lane-Emden_equation_in_N-dimensional_space","abstract":"The general solution is presented in terms of Bessel functions for the\npolytrope of index n = 1, and a straightforward method to obtain the\nSchuster-Emden integral in N-dimensional space. The intimate connection\nbetween polytropic sheets, isothermal cylinders and the Schuster-Emden\nintegral in N-dimensional space, (N not less than 3), is found from\nEmden's equation. A compilation of all exact analytic solutions of the\nLane-Emden equation so far found is presented. The behavior of\nLane-Emden functions is studied numerically for the imaginary sequence,\nand an exact seven-digit tabulation for the boundary values of\npolytropic sheets, cylinders and spheres is provided for the polytropic\nindexes of principal interest. Finally, an improved determination of the\nSeidov-Kuzakhmedov (1978) minimum mass occurring for spherical\npolytropes at polytropic index n of about 4.823 is quoted.","authors":["George Horedt"],"meta":["April 1986Astronomy and Astrophysics 160(1):148-156"],"references":["234375172_The_equilibrium_of_polytropic_self-gravitating_sheetlike_masses","249225904_A_New_Solution_of_the_Lane-Emden_Equation_of_Index_n5","234287131_Polytropic_and_Isothermal_Plane-Symmetric_Configurations","229069688_The_Equilibrium_of_Polytropic_and_Isothermal_Cylinders"]}
