{"id":"346508370_Analysis_of_different_convolution_neural_network_models_to_diagnose_Alzheimer's_disease","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence based medical diagnosis is a new approach in medical field, wherein pathologists are no need to work with glass, but they are using pixels to identify the disease (medical imaging). The scanned images can be sent to any place of the world for testing. Using Artificial intelligence approach, we are using machine learning algorithms to diagnose the disease by comparing the existed dataset in the software. Alzheimer’s is brain cell’s disorder that leads to cell to degenerate and inactive. This will be a reason of dementia. The symptoms of dementia are decreasing of thinking capability, behavioral, communication skills that affects people’s ability to act independently. In this paper we compare different machine learning approaches, like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, which are used to diagnose Alzheimer’s. We analyzed training time and testing time of different object detection algorithms.","authors":["Irfan Ahmad Ganie","Karunakar Pothuganti"],"meta":["October 2020Materials Today: Proceedings","DOI:10.1016/j.matpr.2020.09.625"],"references":["343262752_Speech_Recognition_Transcription_and_transformation_of_human_speech","343262693_IOT_connected_with_e-learning","342571600_Importance_and_Strategic_Planning_of_Team_Management","342220972_Challenges_and_Solution_for_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Cybersecurity_of_the_USA","3595647_Comparison_of_activation_functions_in_multilayer_neural_network_for_pattern_classification","342572925_Partisan_Pandemic_How_Partisanship_and_Public_Health_Concerns_Affect_Individuals'_Social_Distancing_During_COVID-19","337627013_Texture_Underfitting_for_Domain_Adaptation","337521793_Avoiding_Overfitting_When_Applying_Spectral-Spatial_Deep_Learning_Methods_on_Hyperspectral_Images_with_Limited_Labels","326708262_Activation_functions_and_their_characteristics_in_deep_neural_networks","322586237_Overfitting_problem_and_the_over-training_in_the_era_of_data_Particularly_for_Artificial_Neural_Networks","296678885_Early_Diagnosis_of_Alzheimer_Disease_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","283097724_Universal_approximation_using_probabilistic_neural_networks_with_sigmoid_activation_functions","220277908_Controlling_Overfitting_in_Classification-Tree_Models_of_Software_Quality"]}
