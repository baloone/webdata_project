{"id":"308416831_Representation_and_Visualization_of_Urban_Fabric_through_Historical_Documents","abstract":"Documents serve an important role in understanding change in urban fabric. The available multidimensional (spatial, temporal and thematic) information in these documents narrate not only the various features of the elements of the urban fabric but also notifies their changes during time. CityGML standard is used to spatially and temporally represent the city objects. But it misses features to represent city lifecycle and its linked documents. The first part has been addressed recently. In this article, we propose an extension to CityGML standard to integrate city objects and relevant associated documents. Proposing a solution based on standards permits data interoperability. We also briefly describe how these documents are visualized in our current 3D urban environment prototype built over CityGML.","authors":["John Samuel","Clémentine Périnaud","Sylvie Servigne","Georges Gay"],"meta":["October 2016","Conference: 14th Graphics and Cultural Heritage 2016, GCH 2016At: Genova, Italy"],"references":["300426293_Mass_customization_for_cultural_heritage_3D_models","283773169_Virtual_3D_reconstruction_of_Plans-Reliefs_from_historical_document_analysis_for_valorisation_applications","273650229_VIRTUAL_LEODIUM_FROM_AN_HISTORICAL_3D_CITY_SCALE_MODEL_TO_AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM","259979038_On_the_way_to_a_4D_archaeological_GIS_State_of_the_art_future_directions_and_need_for_standardization","301604596_Developpement_d'un_SIG_pour_la_ville_medievale_de_Cluny","300412905_Digital_urban_history_as_an_interpretation_key_of_cities'_Cultural_Heritage","291455305_Management_of_data_changes_in_geo_databases_Time_component_in_GIS","270121125_Modelisations_multi-scalaires_des_dynamiques_urbaines_dans_la_longue_duree_l'exemple_du_quartier_abbatial_de_Vendome_41","258290611_The_Spatial_Humanities_GIS_and_the_Future_of_Humanities_Scholarship","254900948_The_Changing_Image_of_the_City"]}
