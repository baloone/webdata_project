{"id":"289504387_A_security_and_cost_aware_scheduling_algorithm_for_heterogeneous_tasks_of_scientific_workflow_in_clouds","abstract":"Security is increasingly critical for various scientific workflows that are big data applications and typically take quite amount of time being executed on large-scale distributed infrastructures. Cloud computing platform is such an infrastructure that can enable dynamic resource scaling on demand. Nevertheless, based on pay-per-use and hourly-based pricing model, users should pay attention to the cost incurred by renting virtual machines (VMs) from cloud data centers. Meanwhile, workflow tasks are generally heterogeneous and require different instance series (i.e., computing optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, etc.). In this paper, we propose a security and cost aware scheduling (SCAS) algorithm for heterogeneous tasks of scientific workflow in clouds. Our proposed algorithm is based on the meta-heuristic optimization technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO), the coding strategy of which is devised to minimize the total workflow execution cost while meeting the deadline and risk rate constraints. Extensive experiments using three real-world scientific workflow applications, as well as CloudSim simulation framework, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our algorithm.","authors":["Zhongjin Li","Jidong Ge","Hongji Yang","Liguo Huang"],"meta":["January 2016Future Generation Computer Systems 65","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2015.12.014"],"references":["276338149_A_parallel_local_search_in_CPUGPU_for_scheduling_independent_tasks_on_large_heterogeneous_computing_systems","272373406_Security_in_Cloud_Computing_Opportunities_and_Challenges","263694670_Challenges_for_MapReduce_in_Big_Data","262218716_On_Scientific_Workflow_Scheduling_in_Clouds_under_Budget_Constraint","261994993_A_System_Architecture_for_Running_Big_Data_Workflows_in_the_Cloud","261923704_Multi-Objective_Game_Theoretic_Schedulingof_Bag-of-Tasks_Workflows_on_Hybrid_Clouds","256498358_Social-Network-Sourced_Big_Data_Analytics","248573637_Cost-and_Deadline-Constrained_Provisioning_for_Scientific_Workflow_Ensembles_in_IaaS_Clouds","242655374_Cost-Driven_Scheduling_of_Grid_Workflows_Using_Partial_Critical_Paths","225017238_HCOC_A_cost_optimization_algorithm_for_workflow_scheduling_in_hybrid_clouds","221192597_A_Particle_Swarm_Optimization-Based_Heuristic_for_Scheduling_Workflow_Applications_in_Cloud_Computing_Environments","4105301_Scheduling_real_time_parallel_structures_on_cluster_computing_with_possible_processor_failures","4077747_A_trust_brokering_system_and_its_application_to_resource_management_in_public-resource_grids","3419028_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Basic_Concepts_Variants_and_Applications_in_Power_Systems","3418784_Handling_Multiple_Objectives_With_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","3045077_Scheduling_security-critical_real-time_applications_on_clusters","286758932_Reducing_the_Search_Space_for_Big_Data_Mining_for_Interesting_Patterns_from_Uncertain_Data","283336890_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_Framework-a_security_framework_for_business_clouds","283180540_Organisational_Sustainability_Modelling_-_an_emerging_service_and_analytics_model_for_evaluating_Cloud_Computing_adoption_with_two_case_studies","282638369_Towards_a_Big_Data_System_Disaster_Recovery_in_a_Private_Cloud","275199362_The_Business_Intelligence_as_a_Service_in_the_Cloud","265731665_SABA_A_security-aware_and_budget-aware_workflow_scheduling_strategy_in_clouds","264199195_Deadline_Based_Resource_Provisioningand_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Scientific_Workflows_on_Clouds","262397133_A_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Batch_Processing_Workflow_Scheduling","262239960_Budget-Constrained_Resource_Provisioning_for_Scientific_Applications_in_Clouds","261079884_An_analysis_of_cloud_computing_security_issues","259044145_Meeting_Deadlines_of_Scientific_Workflows_in_Public_Clouds_with_Tasks_Replication","257013944_Deadline-constrained_workflow_scheduling_algorithms_for_Infrastructure_as_a_Service_Clouds","257013873_Characterizing_and_profiling_scientific_workflows","254028205_ScaleStar_Budget_Conscious_Scheduling_Precedence-Constrained_Many-task_Workflow_Applications_in_Cloud","235249137_Cost_Minimization_for_Computational_Applications_on_Hybrid_Cloud_Infrastructures","224144604_A_Novel_Security-Driven_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Precedence-Constrained_Tasks_in_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","224086827_Sequential_Auctions_for_Heterogeneous_Task_Allocation_in_Multiagent_Routing_Domains","223867995_XML_distributed_security_policy_for_clusters","222668641_Performance_Evaluation_of_a_New_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Distributed_Systems_with_Security_Heterogeneity","222658699_Deb_K_An_Efficient_Constraint_Handling_Method_for_Genetic_Algorithm_Computer_Methods_in_Applied_Mechanics_and_Engieering_186_311-338","222537957_Dynamic_flies_A_new_pattern_recognition_tool_applied_to_stereo_sequence_processing","222436203_Particle_Swarm_based_Data_Mining_Algorithms_for_classification_tasks","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility","221547997_Graph-Cut_Based_Coscheduling_Strategy_Towards_Efficient_Execution_of_Scientific_Workflows_in_Collaborative_Cloud_Environments","221149146_Cost-Conscious_Scheduling_for_Large_Graph_Processing_in_the_Cloud","220782722_Auto-scaling_to_minimize_cost_and_meet_application_deadlines_in_cloud_workflows","220717700_Resource_Provisioning_with_Budget_Constraints_for_Adaptive_Applications_in_Cloud_Environments","220285707_Cost_optimized_provisioning_of_elastic_resources_for_application_workflows","220280566_CloudSim_A_Toolkit_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Cloud_Computing_Environments_and_Evaluation_of_Resource_Provisioning_Algorithms","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization","3045065_Risk-Resilient_Heuristics_and_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Security-Assured_Grid_Job_Scheduling"]}
