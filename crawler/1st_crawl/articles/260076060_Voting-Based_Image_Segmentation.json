{"id":"260076060_Voting-Based_Image_Segmentation","abstract":"When it comes to image segmentation, there is no single technique that can provide the best possible result for any type of image. Therefore, based on different approaches, numerous algorithms have been developed so far and each has its upsides and downsides, depending on the input data. This paper proposes a voting method that tries to merge different results of some well-known image segmentation algorithms into a relevant output, aimed to be, as frequently as possible, better than any of the independent ones previously computed.","authors":["Costin-Anton Boiangiu","Radu Ioanitescu"],"meta":["December 2013"],"references":["274757092_New_Method_to_Detect_Salient_Objects_in_Image_Segmentation_using_Hypergraph_Structure","274551064_Visualization_of_Segmented_Structures_in_3D_Multimodal_Medical_Data_Sets","235767029_Ashraf_A_Aly_Safaai_Bin_Deris_Nazar_Zaki_Research_Review_For_Digital_Image_Segmentation_Techniques_International_Journal_of_Computer_Science_Information_Technology_IJCSIT_Vol_3_No_5_Oct_2011","233784947_A_comparative_study_of_supervised_evaluation_criteria_for_image_segmentation","225429811_Yet_Another_Survey_on_Image_Segmentation_Region_and_Boundary","313077909_Finding_consistent_clusters_in_data_partitions","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","239061840_Picture_Segmentation_Using_a_Recursive_Region_Splitting_Method","238989997_Image_segmentation_techniques","228083822_Seeded_Region_Growing"]}
