{"id":"327645755_Harmonic_Sierpinski_Gasket_and_Applications","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to investigate the generalization of the Sierpinski gasket through the harmonic metric. In particular, this work presents an antenna based on such generalization. In fact, the harmonic Sierpinski gasket is used as geometric configuration of small antennas. As with fractal antennas and RÃ©nyi entropy, their performance is characterized by the associated entropy that is studied and discussed here.","authors":["Emanuel Guariglia"],"meta":["September 2018Entropy 20(9):714","DOI:10.3390/e20090714","Project: Self-affine fractal antennas"],"references":["303879811_Multifractal_methodology","296333127_Entropy_and_Fractal_Antennas","264936585_Energy_and_Laplacian_on_Hanoi-type_fractal_quantum_graphs","344505217_Lacunarity_of_self-similar_and_stochastically_self-similar_sets","344473624_Harmonic_mappings_of_the_Sierpinski_gasket_to_the_circle","314320692_Harmonic_Coordinates_on_Fractals_with_Finitely_Ramified_Cell_Structure","299682067_Analysis_and_Geometry_of_the_Measurable_Riemannian_Structure_on_the_Sierpinski_Gasket","280768761_Dirichlet_forms_on_non-self-similar_fractals_Hanoi_attractors","267652896_Boundary_Value_Problems_for_Harmonic_Functions_on_a_Domain_in_the_Sierpinski_Gasket","258644087_Body-Sized_Wideband_High_Fidelity_Invisibility_Cloak"]}
