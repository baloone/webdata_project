{"id":"318982373_Code-switching_Usage_in_Social_Media_A_Case_Study_from_Oman","abstract":"Multi-linguals have observed a widespread trend of switching between two utterances in\nforeign language settings entitled code-switching or (CS). It has been noticed that CS usage in social\nnetworking websites has not yet been explored intensively in the higher educational institutions of the\nGulf region; the reason that attracted us to conduct this study in Oman (one of the Arab Gulf region\ncountries). This study explores the educators and learnersâ€™ attitudes towards using CS in social\nnetworks within the higher educational context in Oman. Two questionnaire surveys were\nadministrated with 338 students and 21 educators in the study, in addition to two interview sessions\nwith both students and educators. Results indicated that 86.40 % of the students code-switch on social\nnetworks, whereas 81 % of the educators do so. WhatsApp is found to be the most social networking\nApp used for code-switching by both students and educators. Furthermore, results indicated that\nstudents are highly positive in their attitudes toward the use of code-switching in social media.\nAdditionally, the study presents other implications and future work.","authors":["Mostafa Al-Emran","Noor Al-Qaysi"],"meta":["August 2017"],"references":["344844153_Students'_language_attitude_towards_using_Code-Switching_as_a_medium_of_instruction_in_the_College_of_Health_Sciences","313075362_A_Survey_of_Text_Mining_in_Social_Media_Facebook_and_Twitter_Perspectives","312023090_Academics'_Awareness_Towards_Mobile_Learning_in_Oman","309426869_The_Impact_of_Google_Apps_at_Work_Higher_Educational_Perspective","301312985_Student_engagement_and_foreign_language_learning_through_online_social_networks","291072988_Factors_for_Successful_Use_of_Social_Networking_Sites_in_Higher_Education","287556416_Socio_Linguistic_Study_of_Code_Switching_of_the_Arabic_Language_Speakers_on_Social_Networking","282367523_Impact_of_the_educational_use_of_Facebook_group_on_the_high_school_students'_proper_usage_of_language","309447533_Students_perception_on_the_use_of_social_media_to_learn_English_within_secondary_education_in_developing_countries","285549555_Investigating_attitudes_towards_the_use_of_mobile_learning_in_higher_education"]}
