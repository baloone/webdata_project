{"id":"316451346_Coloring_dense_digraphs","abstract":"The \\emph{chromatic number} of a digraph $D$ is the minimum number of acyclic subgraphs covering the vertex set of $D$. A tournament $H$ is a \\emph{hero} if every $H$-free tournament $T$ has chromatic number bounded by a function of $H$. Inspired by the celebrated Erd\\H{o}s--Hajnal conjecture, Berger et al. fully characterized the class of heroes in 2013. Motivated by a question of the first author and Colin McDiarmid, we study digraphs which we call \\emph{superheroes}. A digraph $H$ is a \\emph{superhero} if every $H$-free digraph $D$ has chromatic number bounded by a function of $H$ and $\\alpha(D)$, the independence number of the underlying graph of $D$. We prove here that a digraph is a superhero if and only if it is a hero, and hence characterize all superheroes. This answers a question of Pierre Aboulker.","authors":["Ararat Harutyunyan","Tien-Nam Le","Alantha Newman","Stéphan Thomassé"],"meta":["April 2017Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 61","DOI:10.1016/j.endm.2017.07.010"],"references":["313395168_Coloring_tournaments_From_local_to_global","227498376_The_circular_chromatic_number_of_a_digraph","220533283_Gallai's_Theorem_for_List_Coloring_of_Digraphs","323716508_The_Voting_Problem","320450732_Domination_in_tournaments","304548383_The_Erdos-Hajnal_Conjecture---A_Survey","266177913_Digraph_Girth_via_Chromatic_Number","263893955_Tournaments_with_near-linear_transitive_subsets","259538802_The_Erdos-Hajnal_Conjecture-A_Survey","256935857_Tournaments_and_colouring","220342753_Strengthened_Brooks'_Theorem_for_Digraphs_of_Girth_at_least_Three","220077487_The_dichromatic_number_of_a_digraph","51948111_Two_results_on_the_digraph_chromatic_number"]}
