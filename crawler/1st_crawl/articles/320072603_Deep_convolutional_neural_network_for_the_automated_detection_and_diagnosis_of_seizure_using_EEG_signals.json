{"id":"320072603_Deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_the_automated_detection_and_diagnosis_of_seizure_using_EEG_signals","abstract":"An encephalogram (EEG) is a commonly used ancillary test to aide in the diagnosis of epilepsy. The EEG signal contains information about the electrical activity of the brain. Traditionally, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. This technique can be time-consuming, limited by technical artifact, provides variable results secondary to reader expertise level, and is limited in identifying abnormalities. Therefore, it is essential to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically distinguish the class of these EEG signals using machine learning techniques. This is the first study to employ the convolutional neural network (CNN) for analysis of EEG signals. In this work, a 13-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is implemented to detect normal, preictal, and seizure classes. The proposed technique achieved an accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 88.67%, 90.00% and 95.00%, respectively.","authors":["U Rajendra Acharya","Shu Lih Oh","Yuki Hagiwara","Jen Hong Tan"],"meta":["September 2017Computers in Biology and Medicine 100","DOI:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.09.017"],"references":["319271551_A_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model_to_Classify_Heartbeats","317821702_Application_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Automated_Detection_of_Myocardial_Infarction_Using_ECG_Signals","317336647_Automated_Detection_of_Coronary_Artery_Disease_Using_Different_Durations_of_ECG_Segments_with_Convolutional_Neural_Network","317153113_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Imaging_General_Overview","315821873_Automated_Detection_of_Arrhythmias_Using_Different_Intervals_of_Tachycardia_ECG_Segments_with_Convolutional_Neural_Network","315782576_Tunable-Q_wavelet_transform_based_multiscale_entropy_measure_for_automated_classification_of_epileptic_EEG_signals","350061913_Computational_Intelligence_Synergies_of_Fuzzy_Logic_Neural_Networks_and_Evolutionary_Computing","328563227_Automated_EEG-Based_Diagnosis_of_Neurological_Disorders_Inventing_the_Future_of_Neurology","319770387_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks"]}
