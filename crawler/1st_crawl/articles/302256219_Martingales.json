{"id":"302256219_Martingales","abstract":"An introduction to martingales appeared in Section 7.4, where convergence theorems for submartingales {S\nn\n, ℱn\n, n ≥ 1} (relating to differentiation theory) were discussed. Here, emphasis will fall upon convergence theorems for martingales {S\n-n\n, ℱ-n\n, n ≤ -1} (relating to ergodic theorems). In demarcating the two cases, it is natural to refer to a martingale {S\nn\n, ℱn\n, n ≥ 1} as an upward martingale and to allude to a martingale {S\n-n\n, ℱ-n\n, n ≤ -1} when written {S\nn\n, ℱn\n, n ≥ 1} as a downward or reverse martingale. Martingale and stochastic inequalities will also be dealt with.","authors":["Yuan Shih Chow","Henry Teicher"],"meta":["January 1988","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4684-0504-0_11","In book: Probability Theory (pp.386-423)"],"references":["38364290_A_Note_on_Convergence_of_Moments","270314260_A_Course_in_Probability_Theory","268028401_A_Sharper_Form_of_the_Borel-Cantelli_Lemma_and_the_Strong_Law","266194699_A_Course_In_Probability_Theory","248159719_Trigonometric_Series_II","248115042_Topics_in_Harmonic_Analysis_related_to_the_Littlewood-Paley_theory","239063659_Martingales_a_Temps_Discret","225105480_Extrapolation_and_interpolation_of_quasi-linear_operators_on_martingales","38367324_On_Optimal_Systems","38365467_A_Sample_Function_Property_of_Martingales","38365395_Martingale_Transforms","38365336_On_a_Strong_Law_of_Large_Numbers_for_Martingales","38365270_Alternative_Proofs_for_Certain_Upcrossing_Inequalities","38365111_A_Decomposition_for_L1-Bounded_Martingales","38365110_Convergence_of_Sums_of_Squares_of_Martingale_Differences","38364811_A_Comparison_Test_for_Martingale_Inequalities","38364350_On_the_L_p-Convergence_for_n-1p_S_n_0_p_21","38362745_On_a_Convex_Function_Inequality_for_Martingales","38362736_Distribution_Function_Inequalities_for_Martingales"]}
