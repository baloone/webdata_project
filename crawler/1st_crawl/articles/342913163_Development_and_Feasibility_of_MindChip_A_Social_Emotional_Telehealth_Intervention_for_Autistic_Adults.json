{"id":"342913163_Development_and_Feasibility_of_MindChip_A_Social_Emotional_Telehealth_Intervention_for_Autistic_Adults","abstract":"The study aims to develop and pilot a telehealth social emotional program, MindChip™ delivered with a computer based interventions (CBI) (Mind Reading©) for autistic adults. MindChip™ combined four theoretical perspectives and community feedback underpinning the essential mechanisms for targeting the social emotional understanding of autistic adults. A randomised pragmatic pilot trial (N = 25) was conducted to explore the feasibility of MindChip™ (n = 11) and to understand the preliminary efficacy of combining it with CBI compared to CBI only (n = 14). The use of MindChip™ and CBI combined demonstrated partial feasibility, with preliminary efficacy findings revealing increased emotion recognition generalisation outcomes compared to CBI only. Further research is required to improve the engagement and personalisation of the intervention for autistic adults.","authors":["Julia Tang","Marita Falkmer","Nigel T M Chen","Sven Bölte"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 51(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10803-020-04592-3"],"references":["333834341_Atypical_Visual_Processing_but_Comparable_Levels_of_Emotion_Recognition_in_Adults_with_Autism_During_the_Processing_of_Social_Scenes","332336605_Social_Cognition_in_Autism_and_Other_Neurodevelopmental_Disorders_A_Co-twin_Control_Study","328616660_Designing_a_Serious_Game_for_Youth_with_ASD_Perspectives_from_End-Users_and_Professionals","321325439_Disentangling_self-management_goal_setting_and_action_planning_A_scoping_review","318991083_A_specialist_peer_mentoring_program_for_university_students_on_the_autism_spectrum_A_pilot_study","330860463_The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","320403286_Does_'mentoring'_offer_effective_support_to_autistic_adults_A_mixed_methods_pilot_study","319770527_Mind_Reading_The_Interactive_Guide_to_Emotions","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","315928716_Emotion_recognition_training_in_autism_spectrum_disorder_A_systematic_review_of_challenges_related_to_generalizability","313828975_An_Overview_of_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_Heterogeneity_and_Treatment_Options","317044081_Serious_games_to_teach_social_interactions_and_emotions_to_individuals_with_autism_spectrum_disorders_ASD","312879599_The_expression_of_the_emotions_in_man_and_animals","312468274_WASI-II_wechsler_abbreviated_scale_of_intelligence_-_second_edition"]}
