{"id":"322349645_Investigating_temporal_access_in_a_flipped_classroom_procrastination_persists","abstract":"This paper reports on a study that examines the learning behaviors and characteristics of students in a mobile applications computer programming class that adopted a “flipped” learning style. By harvesting learning analytics data from a learning management system, we created visualizations of work intensity to explore temporal patterns of students’ behavior and then correlate them with the students’ performance. Findings indicate that low, medium, and high performing students tend to access learning materials late with work intensity spiking on the lecture day, specifically during the lecture session. While high and low performing students show no difference in temporal access to material, medium performing students demonstrate the greatest degree of vibrancy regarding course content material access. Further a discussion of implications and insights on procrastination in the context of flipped classrooms are included.","authors":["Abeer Aljarrah","Michael K.
