{"id":"341421723_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Predicting_Malnutrition_among_Under-Five_Children_in_Bangladesh","abstract":"Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to predict the malnutrition status among under-five children in Bangladesh by using various machine learning (ML) algorithms.\n\nMethods\nFor analysis purposes the nationally representative secondary records from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) was utilized. Five well-known ML algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) has been considered to accurately predict malnutrition status among children. Additionally, a systematic assessment of the algorithms was performed by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa statistic.\n\nResults\nBased on various performance parameter the best results have been accomplished by the RF algorithm having demonstrated an accuracy of 68.51%, a sensitivity of 94.66% and a specificity of 69.76%. Additionally, a most extreme discriminative ability was appeared by RF classification (Cohen's kappa statistic=0.2434).\n\nConclusion\nOn the basis of the findings, we can presume that RF algorithm predict the malnutrition status among under-five children in Bangladesh moderately superior to any other ML algorithms utilized in this study. Finally, our research recommends applying random forest classification with random forest feature selection when the prediction of malnutrition is the core interest.","authors":["Ashis Talukder","Benojir Ahammed"],"meta":["May 2020Nutrition 78:110861","DOI:10.1016/j.nut.2020.110861"],"references":["328368657_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_To_Predict_The_Childhood_Anemia_In_Bangladesh","318665563_Predicting_diabetes_mellitus_using_SMOTE_and_ensemble_machine_learning_approach_The_Henry_Ford_ExercIse_Testing_FIT_project","315950089_Exploration_of_machine_learning_techniques_in_predicting_multiple_sclerosis_disease_course","304611953_Association_of_Low-Birth_Weight_with_Malnutrition_in_Children_under_Five_Years_in_Bangladesh_Do_Mother's_Education_Socio-Economic_Status_and_Birth_Interval_Matter","284209332_Factors_affecting_malnutrition_in_children_and_the_uptake_of_interventions_to_prevent_the_condition","282732875_Predictors_of_child_chronic_malnutrition_in_Bangladesh","265135182_Screening_for_Prediabetes_Using_Machine_Learning_Models","264460462_Association_between_economic_growth_and_early_childhood_undernutrition_Evidence_from_121_Demographic_and_Health_Surveys_from_36_low-income_and_middle-income_countries","236023992_Levels_and_determinants_of_child_undernutrition_in_Bangladesh","235370244_Comparison_of_three_data_mining_models_for_predicting_diabetes_or_prediabetes_by_risk_factors","228451484_Classification_and_Regression_by_RandomForest","44595865_Novel_solutions_for_an_old_disease_Diagnosis_of_acute_appendicitis_with_random_forest_support_vector_machines_and_artificial_neural_networks","42388347_Application_of_support_vector_machine_modeling_for_prediction_of_common_diseases_The_case_of_diabetes_and_pre-diabetes","26564294_Factors_Causing_Malnutrition_among_under_Five_Children_in_Bangladesh","7042291_Influence_of_infant-feeding_practice_on_nutritional_status_of_under-five_children","320437653_Investigation_of_Nutritional_Status_of_Children_based_on_Machine_Learning_Techniques_using_Indian_Demographic_and_Health_Survey_Data","282707871_Nearest_Neighbor_Pattern_Classification","265544297_Supervised_Machine_Learning_A_Review_of_Classification_Techniques","263153594_Maternal_and_child_undernutrition_global_and_regional_exposures_and_health_consequences","224227835_Feature_Selection_Based_on_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis","220216700_Akay_MF_Support_vector_machines_combined_with_feature_selection_for_breast_cancer_diagnosis_Expert_systems_with_applications_362_3240-3247","31115032_Socioeconomic_and_Anthropometric_Status_and_Mortality_of_Young_Children_in_Rural_Bangladesh","13823812_Socioeconomic_and_Demographic_Factors_Are_Associated_with_Worldwide_Patterns_of_Stunting_and_Wasting_of_Children12","11331572_Child_Feeding_Practices_Are_Associated_with_Child_Nutritional_Status_in_Latin_America_Innovative_Uses_of_the_Demographic_and_Health_Surveys12","5643278_Maternal_and_child_undernutrition_1_-_Maternal_and_child_undernutrition_global_and_regional_exposures_and_health_consequences"]}
