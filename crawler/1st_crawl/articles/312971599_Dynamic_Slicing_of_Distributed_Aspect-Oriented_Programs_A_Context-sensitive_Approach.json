{"id":"312971599_Dynamic_Slicing_of_Distributed_Aspect-Oriented_Programs_A_Context-sensitive_Approach","abstract":"This paper presents a dynamic parallel context-sensitive slicing algorithm for distributed AOPs. The context-sensitivity makes the computed slice more precise and accurate. We introduce parallelism in our algorithm to make slice computation faster. We have developed a tool called D-AspectJ slicer to compute dynamic slices for distributed AOPs. The proposed slicing technique is compared with two other related existing techniques using ten case studies. The experimentation shows that our proposed slicing algorithm generates smaller slices in less time as compared to other two existing algorithms.","authors":["Jagannath Singh","Pabitra Mohan Khilar","Durga Prasad Mohapatra"],"meta":["January 2017Computer Standards & Interfaces 52","DOI:10.1016/j.csi.2017.01.007"],"references":["308733246_Context_Sensitive_Dynamic_Slicing_of_Concurrent_Aspect-Oriented_Programs","263570819_Granularity-Driven_Dynamic_Predicate_Slicing_Algorithms_for_Message_Passing_Systems_Special_Issue_on_Source_Code_Analysis_and_Manipulation","261229563_A_unique_aspect-oriented_program_slicing_technique","258386055_Combining_Slicing_and_Constraint_Solving_for_Better_Debugging_The_CONBAS_Approach","258378427_New_Generation_of_Software_Metrics","228620652_Aspect_Oriented_Requirements_Engineering_A_Theme_Based_Vector-Orientation_Model","220631499_Slicing-based_test_case_generation_from_UML_activity_diagrams","220631356_Slicing_UML_architectural_models","220299221_A_Dependence_Representation_for_Coverage_Testing_of_Object-Oriented_Programs","220299153_Test_Case_Generation_Based_on_State_and_Activity_Models","3959975_Slicing_aspect-oriented_software","3893272_Dynamic_slicing_method_for_maintenance_of_large_C_programs","3187373_Using_Program_Slicing_In_Software_Maintenance","313210214_A_survey_of_program_slicing_techniques","303092688_A_Graph-Based_Dynamic_Slicing_of_Distributed_Aspect-Oriented_Software","300227202_An_Investigation_into_Effective_Test_Coverage","222467890_Program_Slicing","222435353_Distributed_dynamic_slicing_of_Java_programs","220386821_Dynamic_slicing_of_distributed_object-oriented_programs","220130816_A_formalisation_of_the_relationship_between_forms_of_program_slicing","220114727_Dynamic_Program_Slicing","8919369_Comparative_anatomical_study_of_three_surgical_approaches_for_treating_complex_posterior_urethral_stricture","4269493_Functional_Specifications_of_Object_Oriented_Systems_A_Model_Driven_Framework","3876669_Interoperability_with_distributed_objects_through_Java_wrapper","3665322_Dynamic_slicing_of_distributed_programs","3625930_Slicing_object-oriented_software","2933535_Context-Sensitive_Slicing_of_Concurrent_Programs","2890139_Cost_Effective_Dynamic_Program_Slicing","2618009_Distributed_Slicing_and_Partial_Re-execution_for_Distributed_Programs"]}
