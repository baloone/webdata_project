{"id":"11493867_Dynamics_of_Stability_The_Physiologic_Basis_of_Functional_Health_and_Frailty","abstract":"Under basal resting conditions most healthy physiologic systems demonstrate highly irregular, complex dynamics that represent\ninteracting regulatory processes operating over multiple time scales. These processes prime the organism for an adaptive response,\nmaking it ready and able to react to sudden physiologic stresses. When the organism is perturbed or deviates from a given\nset of boundary conditions, most physiologic systems evoke closed-loop responses that operate over relatively short periods\nof time to restore the organism to equilibrium. This transiently alters the dynamics to a less complex, dominant response\nmode, which is denoted “reactive tuning.” Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in resting dynamics and\nmaladaptive responses to perturbations. These alterations in the dynamics of physiologic systems lead to functional decline\nand frailty. Nonlinear mathematical techniques that quantify physiologic dynamics may predict the onset of frailty, and interventions\naimed toward restoring healthy dynamics may prevent functional decline.","authors":["Lewis A Lipsitz"],"meta":["April 2002The Journals of Gerontology Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences
