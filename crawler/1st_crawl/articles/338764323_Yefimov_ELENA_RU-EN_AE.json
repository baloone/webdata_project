{"id":"338764323_Yefimov_ELENA_RU-EN_AE","abstract":"Some people wrongly believe that A. Turing’s works that underlie all modern computer science never discussed “physical” robots. This is not so, since Turing did speak about such machines, though making a reservation that this discussion was still premature. In particular, in his 1948 report [8], he suggested that a physical intelligent machine equipped with motors, cameras and loudspeakers, when wandering through the fields of England, would present “the danger to the ordinary citizen would be serious.” [8, ]. Due to this imperfection of technology in the field of knowledge that we now call robotics, the methodology that he proposed was based on human speech, or rather on text. Other natural human skills were too difficult to implement, while the exchange of cues via written messages was much more accessible for engineering implementation in Turing’s time. Nevertheless, since then, the progress of computer technology has taken forms that the founder of artificial intelligence could not have foreseen.","authors":["Albert Efimoff"],"meta":["December 2020","Project: Philosophy of AI and Robotics"],"references":["329654159_A_Voice_and_Nothing_More","324352231_Understanding_Media_The_Extensions_of_Man"]}
