{"id":"222509803_Characterization_of_derived_graphs","abstract":"The derived graph of a graph G has the edges of G as its vertices, with adjacency determined by the adjacency of the edges in G. A new characterization of derived graphs is given in terms of nine excluded subgraphs. A proof of the equivalence of all known characterizations is also given.","authors":["Lowell Beineke"],"meta":["September 1970Journal of Combinatorial Theory 9(2):129-135","DOI:10.1016/S0021-9800(70)80019-9"],"references":["287012350_Demonstration_nouvelle_d'une_theoreme_de_Whitney_sur_les_reseaux","266001547_The_Isomorphism_between_Graphs_and_their_Adjoint_Graphs","246696554_Linear_Graphs_and_Electrical_Networks","242792799_On_Repeated_Interchange_Graphs","238711642_Congruent_Graphs_and_the_Connectivity_of_Graphs","230596096_The_Theory_of_Graphs","226373342_The_interchange_graph_of_a_finite_graph","38366922_The_Uniqueness_of_the_Triangular_Association_Scheme","38366765_On_a_Characterization_of_the_Triangular_Association_Scheme","38366614_On_the_Uniqueness_of_the_Triangular_Association_Scheme","38366175_On_the_Line-Graph_of_the_Complete_Bigraph","38365976_On_the_Line_Graph_of_the_Complete_Bipartite_Graph"]}
