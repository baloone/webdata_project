{"id":"312236880_Optimal_binary_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_non-chain_ring","abstract":"We construct an infinite family of two-Lee-weight codes over the ring . These codes are defined as trace codes and have the algebraic structure of abelian codes. Their Lee weight distribution is computed by using character sums. Then, taking Gray mapping, we obtain an infinite family of abelian binary two-weight codes which are shown to be optimal by application of the Griesmer bound. Moreover, an application to secret sharing schemes is given.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Yan Liu","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 219(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2016.09.050","Project: Trace codes over rings with few weights"],"references":["257682817_A_family_of_constacyclic_codes_over_F_2_uF_2_vF_2_uvF_2","233932955_Spectra_of_Graphs","220639368_Ring_geometries_Two-Weight_Codes_and_Strongly_Regular_Graphs","3079781_Cyclic_codes_and_self-dual_codes_over_F2uF2","309081987_Optimal_two_weight_codes_over_mathbbF_2umathbbF_2","248414186_Weights_of_linear_codes_and_strongly_regular_normed_spaces","247891774_The_Geometry_of_Two-Weight_Codes","242923245_Linear_codes_over_mathbbF_2umathbbF_2vmathbbF_2uvmathbbF_2","224105132_A_Bound_for_Error-Correcting_Codes","220909314_Covering_and_Secret_Sharing_with_Linear_Codes","48195126_Properties_of_Codes_with_Two_Homogeneous_Weights","3085685_Secret_sharing_schemes_from_three_classes_of_linear_codes","3079587_Minimal_vectors_in_linear_codes"]}
