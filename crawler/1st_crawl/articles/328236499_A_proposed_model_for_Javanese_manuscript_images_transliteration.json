{"id":"328236499_A_proposed_model_for_Javanese_manuscript_images_transliteration","abstract":"Manuscript transliteration is generally conducted by reading the manuscript and then writing the results to another piece of paper or storing them on a computer using a specific text-processing program. The procedure of transliteration presupposes that the workers fully understand how to read the manuscript, that no consideration is given to the length of the work, and that workers will concentrate sufficiently to minimize errors in rewriting. There are 3 main steps for Javanese manuscript image transliteration, i.e., segmenting manuscript, transliterating of Javanese script letters or numbers, and grouping syllables. The implementation of the proposed model was tested on a Javanese manuscript with catalogue number SB.141 and at a confidence level of 95% and resulting in a success rate between 69.20% and 87.29%.","authors":["Anastasia Widiarti","Reza Pulungan","Agus Harjoko","Marsono Marsono"],"meta":["September 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1098:012014","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1098/1/012014","Project: thinning of various local character"],"references":["220180128_Optical_Font_Recognition_from_Projection_Profiles"]}
