{"id":"317756653_New_energy-preserving_finite_volume_element_scheme_for_the_korteweg-de_vries_equation","abstract":"In this paper, an energy-preserving finite volume element scheme is proposed for the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The scheme is a combination of the discrete variational derivative method in time and the finite volume element method in space. The scheme can precisely conserve the global mass and energy at the discrete level, as well as has higher accuracy. For comparison, we also propose a momentum-preserving scheme and a finite volume element scheme. The numerical results demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and efficiency of our method compared with other schemes.","authors":["J. Yan","L.
