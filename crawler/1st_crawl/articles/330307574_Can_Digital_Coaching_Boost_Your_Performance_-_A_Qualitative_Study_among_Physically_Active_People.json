{"id":"330307574_Can_Digital_Coaching_Boost_Your_Performance_-_A_Qualitative_Study_among_Physically_Active_People","abstract":"The use of sport and wellness technology devices among athletes is highly popular. At the same time the demand for easy to understand, clear, and personalized information is also growing. Instead of numbers, users need and want solutions. Digital coaching can offer solutions for this by providing valuable training data and offering guidance and instructions on how to improve the training. This exploratory study focuses on the experiences, needs, and wants regarding a digital coach application among physically active people, more precisely crosscountry skiers. We found that the digital coach was perceived to have motivational elements. It was also viewed having potential to increase the awareness relating to personal performance level and technique as well as bring diversity into training. However, some perceived demotivating elements suggest that future development is needed. Our findings give insights to sport technology companies as well as athletes and coaches about the influence and possibilities of digital coaching among athletes and physically active people.","authors":["Eeva Kettunen","Will Critchley","Tuomas Kari"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.24251/HICSS.2019.163","Conference: 52nd Hawaii International Conference on System SciencesAt: Grand Wailea, Maui, Hawaii"],"references":["328048643_Digital_Coaching_and_Athlete's_Self-Efficacy_-_A_Quantitative_Study_on_Sport_and_Wellness_Technology","325773815_Can_Sport_and_Wellness_Technology_be_My_Personal_Trainer_-_Teenagers_and_Digital_Coaching","325769160_Influence_of_Digital_Coaching_on_Physical_Activity_Motivation_and_Behaviour_of_Physically_Inactive_Individuals","320963222_Wearable_Technology_for_Athletes_Information_Overload_and_Pseudoscience","319591752_WELLNESS_ROUTINES_WITH_WEARABLE_ACTIVITY_TRACKERS_A_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW_Completed_Research","318758010_The_Motivational_Impact_of_Wearable_Healthy_Lifestyle_Technologies_A_Self-determination_Perspective_on_Fitbits_With_Adolescents","318039573_Wellness_Technology_Use_in_Everyday_Life_A_Diary_Study","324925202_The_expected_and_perceived_well-being_effects_of_short-Term_self-Tracking_technology_use","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","306153328_Applied_Thematic_Analysis"]}
