{"id":"356108330_An_ordering_of_fuzzy_numbers_based_on_the_Zadeh_extension_principle","abstract":"Order appears in all areas related to mathematics and computer science. Given a set in many cases it is desirable to establish a precedence relation between the elements of the set either total or partial. In this paper, we explore an ordering operator for fuzzy numbers that is based on the Zadeh extension principle. This proposal takes into account the intuition of users of Database Management Systems. Our analysis includes a formal proof of these operatorâ€™s properties and examples of the applicability of the operator in representative cases that show its suitability for intuition management. Also, an operator implementation in the Haskell and SQL languages is presented. This allows its evaluation in different contexts.","authors":["Ana Isabel Aguilera","Soraya Carrasquel","David Coronado","Ricardo Monascal"],"meta":["November 2021Soft Computing","DOI:10.1007/s00500-021-06470-1"],"references":["337921760_Combining_technique_for_order_preference_by_similarity_to_ideal_solution_with_relative_preference_relation_for_interval-valued_fuzzy_multi-criteria_decision-making","332030055_Utilization_of_trapezoidal_intuitionistic_fuzzy_numbers_and_extended_fuzzy_preference_relation_for_multi-criteria_group_decision-making_based_on_individual_differentiation_of_decision-makers","328232105_A_NEW_APPROACH_FOR_ORDERING_FUZZY_NUMBERS_AND_ITS_APPLICATION_TO_FUZZY_MATRIX_GAMES","320408333_Ranking_Fuzzy_Numbers_by_Centroid_Method","305644091_Analyzing_the_Ranking_Method_for_Fuzzy_Numbers_in_Fuzzy_Decision_Making_Based_on_the_Magnitude_Concepts","330234507_R-numbers_a_new_risk_modeling_associated_with_fuzzy_numbers_and_its_application_to_decision_making","325613925_NEAT_F-PROMETHEE_-_A_new_fuzzy_multiple_criteria_decision_making_method_based_on_the_adjustment_of_mapping_trapezoidal_fuzzy_numbers","324310281_Ranking_Generalized_Fuzzy_Numbers_Based_on_Centroid_and_Rank_Index","322279087_Yager_Index_and_Ranking_for_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Numbers","308755799_Fuzzy_TOPSIS_method_with_ordered_fuzzy_numbers_for_flow_control_in_a_manufacturing_system","283197386_Recent_Developments_on_Summability_Theory_and_Its_Applications","291247157_Is_'Fuzzy_Theory'_An_Appropriate_Tool_for_Large_Size_Decision_Problems","282054530_USE_OF_FUZZY_SET_THEORY_IN_ELECTROCARDIOLOGICAL_DIAGNOSTICS","270812316_Discrete_Mathematics_and_its_applications","264563318_A_Novel_Method_for_Ranking_Generalized_Fuzzy_Numbers"]}
