{"id":"251187902_A_geometrical_property_of_POV-measures_and_systems_of_covariance","abstract":"A Choquet type of an integral representation is found for a class of normalized positive operator valued (POV) measures on\na Hilbert space. An arbitrary POV-measure within this class is thereby represented uniquely as an integral over projection\nvalued (PV) measures. As an application, the case of a commutative system of covariance (representing a generalization of\nthe imprimitivity theorem of Mackey) is discussed. The relevance of these results to the theory of quantum mechanical observables,\nadmitting stochastic value spaces, is pointed out.","authors":["Syed Twareque Ali"],"meta":["January 1982","DOI:10.1007/BFb0092439"],"references":["227290000_Covariant_representations_ofC-algebras_and_their_locally_compact_automorphism_groups","270152504_Notes_on_Spectral_Theory","259149430_Les_Algebres_D'Operateurs_Dans_L'Espace_Hilbertien","243052195_The_Trace_in_Finite_Operator_Algebras","234872855_Fuzzy_observables_in_quantum_mechanics","234855141_Systems_of_imprimitivity_and_representations_of_quantum_mechanics_on_fuzzy_phase_spaces","227316147_Consistent_models_of_spin_0_and_12_extended_particles_scattering_in_external_fields","226770023_Systems_of_covariance_and_subrepresentations_of_induced_representations","226067656_Coherent_states_and_induced_representations","225485771_On_Mackey's_Imprimitivity_Theorem","38344798_Multiplicative_and_extreme_positive_operators","38327805_An_operational_approach_to_quantum_probability","7191080_Imprimitivity_for_Representations_of_Locally_Compact_Groups_I"]}
