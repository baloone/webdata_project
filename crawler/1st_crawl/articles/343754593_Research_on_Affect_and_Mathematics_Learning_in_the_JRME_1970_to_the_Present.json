{"id":"343754593_Research_on_Affect_and_Mathematics_Learning_in_the_JRME_1970_to_the_Present","abstract":"Studies of affective issues have always been central to the goals of mathematics education and to the pages of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Educmion (JRME) . Over the past 25 years, approximately 100 of the JRME 's articles have dealt with some aspect of the affective domain: although it is not possible to review the contributions of each of those articles in this paper, we will try to convey some of the flavor of research on affective issues as it has developed over the life of the journal.","authors":["Douglas B.
