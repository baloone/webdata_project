{"id":"267055858_Waiting_Time_in_Bulk_Service_Queues","abstract":"The queuing process considered is that in which customers arrive at random and form a single queue in order of arrival. They are served in batches, the size of the batch being either a fixed number or the size of the queue, whichever is the smaller. Assuming that the queue is in equilibrium, the Laplace transform of the waiting time distribution is derived from the probability generating function of the queue length distribution. Expressions are obtained for the mean and variance of the waiting time, and a brief discussion is included of the computation of these quantities when the time intervals between successive epochs of service are independently distributed in a Ï‡2 distribution with an even number of degrees of freedom. A short table of numerical results is given.","authors":["F. Downton"],"meta":["July 1955Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
