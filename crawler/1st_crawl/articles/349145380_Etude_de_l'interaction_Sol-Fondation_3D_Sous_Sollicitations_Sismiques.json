The vibrations come only from harmonic seismic waves P, SV, SH and R. The key step is the characterization of soil-foundation interaction through the impedance matrix connecting at each frequency, the forces applied to the resulting displacement of one part and the matrix of movements connecting the displacement vector of the foundation to amplitudes vector field of free movement of another part. The mathematical approach is based on the method of integral equations in the frequency domain using the formalism of Green functions of (Kausel Peeck and 1982) for a layered soil. Appropriate discretization of the soil-foundation interface in constant quadrilateral elements used to make these algebraic equations and transform the force displacement relationship in discretized into a system of linear equations.This approach has been applied to analyze the effect of soil-structure interaction on seismic response of the foundation.","authors":["Badreddine Sbartai","Salah Messioud"],"meta":["February 2021","Thesis for: Ph.DAdvisor: Prof. B.
