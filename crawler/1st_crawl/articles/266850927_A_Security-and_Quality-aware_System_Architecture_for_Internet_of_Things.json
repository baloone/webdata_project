{"id":"266850927_A_Security-and_Quality-aware_System_Architecture_for_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized, at the system level, by high diversity with respect to enabling technologies and supported services. IoT also assumes to deal with a huge amount of heterogeneous data generated by devices, transmitted by the underpinning infrastructure and processed to support value-added services. In order to provide users with valuable output, the IoT architecture should guarantee the suitability and trustworthiness of the processed data. This is a major requirement of such systems in order to guarantee robustness and reliability at the service level. In this paper, we introduce a novel IoT architecture able to support security, privacy and data quality guarantees, thereby effectively boosting the diffusion of IoT services.","authors":["Sabrina Sicari","Cinzia Cappiello","Daniele Miorandi","Francesco De Pellegrini"],"meta":["November 2014Information Systems Frontiers","DOI:10.1007/s10796-014-9538-x"],"references":["262169659_Data_Quality_Observation_in_Pervasive_Environments","310845326_Survey_internet_of_things_Vision_applications_and_research_challenges","261390168_A_privacy_enhanced_DNS_scheme_for_the_Internet_Of_Things","261083602_Efficient_Data_Tagging_for_Managing_Privacy_in_the_Internet_of_Things","261041950_User_interactive_Internet_of_Things_privacy_preserved_access_control","260480165_Big_Data_The_Next_Frontier_for_Innovation_Comptetition_and_Productivity","259638840_Anonymous_Authentication_for_Privacy-preserving_IoT_Target-driven_Applications","259143142_Opportunistic_IoT_Exploring_the_harmonious_interaction_between_human_and_the_internet_of_things","247434030_Role_base_access_control_models","235642082_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Applications_and_Research_Challenges"]}
