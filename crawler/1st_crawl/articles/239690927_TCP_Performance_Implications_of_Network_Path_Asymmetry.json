{"id":"239690927_TCP_Performance_Implications_of_Network_Path_Asymmetry","abstract":"This document describes TCP performance problems that arise becauseof asymmetric effects. These problems arise in several accessnetworks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radiosubnetworks, for different underlying reasons. However, the endresult on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performanceoften degrades significantly because of imperfection and variabilityin the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender.","authors":["Hari Balakrishnan","Padmanabhan VN","G.
