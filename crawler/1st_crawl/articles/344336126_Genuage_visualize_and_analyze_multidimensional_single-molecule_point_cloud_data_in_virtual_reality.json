{"id":"344336126_Genuage_visualize_and_analyze_multidimensional_single-molecule_point_cloud_data_in_virtual_reality","abstract":"Experimentally recorded point cloud data, such as those generated by single-molecule localization microscopy, are continuously increasing in size and dimension. Gaining an intuitive understanding and facilitating the analysis of such multidimensional data remains challenging. Here we report a new open-source software platform, Genuage, that enables the easy perception of, interaction with and analysis of multidimensional point clouds in virtual reality. Genuage is compatible with arbitrary multidimensional data extending beyond single-molecule localization microscopy.","authors":["Thomas Blanc","Mohamed El Beheiry","Cl√©ment Caporal","jean-baptiste Masson"],"meta":["November 2020Nature Methods 17(11):1-3","DOI:10.1038/s41592-020-0946-1"],"references":["344667212_vLUME_3D_virtual_reality_for_single-molecule_localization_microscopy","340307547_Factors_Associated_With_Virtual_Reality_Sickness_in_Head-Mounted_Displays_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","338727558_vLUME_3D_Virtual_Reality_for_Single-molecule_Localization_Microscopy","292671735_Quantitative_nanoscale_imaging_of_orientational_order_in_biological_filaments_by_polarized_superresolution_microscopy","268874856_Whole-cell_multicolor_superresolution_imaging_using_volumetric_multifocus_microscopy","342328726_Virtual_Reality_Beyond_Visualization","321414096_Accessible_virtual_reality_of_biomolecular_structural_models_using_the_Autodesk_Molecule_Viewer","299498487_A_Primer_on_the_Bayesian_Approach_to_High-Density_Single-Molecule_Trajectories_Analysis","280097408_InferenceMAP_mapping_of_single-molecule_dynamics_with_Bayesian_inference","274402987_InferenceMAP_Mapping_of_Single-Molecule_Dynamics_with_Bayesian_Inference","262885790_Accessing_the_third_dimension_in_localization-based_super-resolution_microscopy","253647406_ViSP_Representing_single-particle_localizations_in_three_dimensions","6885417_Imaging_Intracellular_Fluorescent_Proteins_at_Nanometer_Resolution"]}
