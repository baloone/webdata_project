{"id":"275974861_Dynamic_Grover_Search_Applications_in_Recommendation_systems_and_Optimization_problems","abstract":"In the recent years we have seen that Grover search algorithm [1] by using\nquantum parallelism has revolutionized the field of solving huge class of NP\nproblems in comparison to classical systems. In this work we explore the idea\nof extending the Grover search algorithm to approximate algorithms. Here we try\nto analyze the applicability of Grover search to process an unstructured\ndatabase with dynamic selection function as compared to the static selection\nfunction in the original work[1]. This allows us to extend the application of\nGrover search to the field of randomized search algorithms. We further use the\nDynamic Grover search algorithm to define the goals for a recommendation\nsystem, and define the algorithm for recommendation system for binomial\nsimilarity distribution space giving us a quadratic speedup over traditional\nunstructured recommendation systems. Finally we see how the Dynamic Grover\nSearch can be used to attack a wide range of optimization problems where we\nimprove complexity over existing optimization algorithms.","authors":["Indranil Chakrabarty","Shahzor Khan","Vanshdeep Singh"],"meta":["April 2017Quantum Information Processing 16(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-017-1600-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269180686_Fixed-Point_Quantum_Search_with_an_Optimal_Number_of_Queries","268712214_Speed-up_and_entanglement_in_quantum_Searching","267553084_On_the_Approximability_of_NP-complete_Optimization_Problems","264023918_A_Literature_Review_and_Classification_of_Recommender_Systems_on_Academic_Journals","261325345_Quantum_Circuit_for_Calculating_Mean_Values_Via_Grover-like_Algorithm","257641695_Quantum_search_with_certainty_based_on_modified_Grover_algorithms_Optimum_choice_of_parameters","316807177_Algorithmics_for_Hard_Problems","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","257632066_A_hybrid_online-product_recommendation_system_Combining_implicit_rating-based_collaborative_filtering_and_sequential_pattern_analysis","257404233_Social_knowledge-based_recommender_system_Application_to_the_movies_domain"]}
