{"id":"282208617_The_combined_effects_of_age_and_seniority_on_research_performance_of_full_professors","abstract":"In this paper we examine the relationship between research performance, age, and seniority in academic rank of full professors\nin the Italian academic system. Differently from a large part of the literature, our results generally show a negative monotonic\nrelationship between age and research performance, in all the disciplines under analysis. We also highlight a positive relationship\nbetween seniority in rank and performance, occurring particularly in certain disciplines. While in medicine, biology, and\nchemistry this result could be explained by the ‘accumulative advantage’ effect, in other disciplines, like civil engineering,\nand pedagogy and psychology, it could be due to the existence of a large performance differential between young and mature\nresearchers, at the moment of the promotion to full professors. These results, witnessed both generally and at the level of\nthe individual disciplines, offer useful insights for policy makers and administrators in academia on the role of older professors.","authors":["Giovanni Abramo","Ciriaco Andrea D’Angelo","Gianluca Murgia"],"meta":["July 2015Science and Public Policy 43(3):scv037","DOI:10.1093/scipol/scv037"],"references":["311453014_Age_Aging_and_Age_Structure_in_Science","279888857_The_Economics_of_Science","324621965_Social_Stratification_in_Science","321877961_Citation_Analysis_in_Research_Evaluation","321220084_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Technological_Obsolescence","298852493_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science","284399661_Information_Theory_and_an_Extension_of_the_Maximum_Likelihood_Principle","275862111_Extrinsic_Reward_Valences_and_Productivity_of_Business_Faculty_A_within-and_between-Subjects_Decision_Modeling_Experiment","272561843_Blackburn_RT_Behymer_CE_Hall_DE_Research_note_correlates_of_faculty_publications","272541905_Faculty_Mentoring_Faculty_in_a_Public_University"]}
