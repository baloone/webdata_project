{"id":"247174000_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science_An_Introductory_Course","abstract":"There are many branches of philosophy called \"the philosophy of X,\" where X = disciplines ranging from history to physics. The philosophy of artificial intelligence has a long history, and there are many courses and texts with that title. Surprisingly, the philosophy of computer science is not nearly as well-developed. This article proposes topics that might constitute the philosophy of computer science and describes a course covering those topics, along with suggested readings and assignments.","authors":["William Rapaport"],"meta":["December 2005Teaching Philosophy 28(4)","DOI:10.5840/teachphil200528443"],"references":["247173888_Philosophical_Issues_about_Computation_PDF","315402975_Can_Humans_Think_Machines_Think","293510541_Are_logic_and_mathematics_identical","272088622_Sciences_of_The_Artificial","266583428_The_Present_Theory_of_Turing_Machine_Computability","264953204_Program_verification_Fundamental_issues_in_computer_science","262321336_The_Models_Are_Broken_the_Models_Are_Broken","248420932_What_Is_a_Computer_An_Electronic_Discussion","247174032_Philosophy_A_Brief_Guide_for_Undergraduates","243773038_The_Computer_and_the_Mind_An_Introduction_to_Cognitive_Science"]}
