{"id":"292333790_The_Genome_of_the_Sea_Urchin_Strongylocentrotus_purpuratus","abstract":"10.1126/science.1133609\nWe report the sequence and analysis of the 814-megabase genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus\npurpuratus, a model for developmental and systems biology. The sequencing strategy combined\nwhole-genome shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. This use of BAC clones,\naided by a pooling strategy, overcame difficulties associated with high heterozygosity of the genome.\nThe genome encodes about 23,300 genes, including many previously thought to be vertebrate\ninnovations or known only outside the deuterostomes. This echinoderm genome provides an\nevolutionary outgroup for the chordates and yields insights into the evolution of deuterostomes.","authors":["Erica Sodergren","George Weinstock","Eric H.
