{"id":"287465752_Examining_the_Male_Antisocial_Stereotype_of_High_Computer_Users","abstract":"The popular stereotype of the frequent computer user persists to be one of a male, socially inadequate and isolated individual - a perception which has been found to cause many students to avoid coming into contact with information and communications technology (ICT), both inside and outside of school. This article reports on a study examining the gender and social competency of both frequent and infrequent computer-using students in Year 12 (n = 117). The results suggest that students who are highly oriented toward ICT are just as likely to be female as they are male and are no less sociable, popular, or self-assured than their non-ICT using peers. These data are then contrasted with interview data from the \"high\" and \"low\" using students which suggest that negative stereotyping of the computer-using student persists - although primarily among students not engaging with ICT in school. The article postulates that the vast increases in ICT use in schools over the last ten years has created a more accessible \"computer culture\" to which increasing numbers of students are now subscribing; although teachers need to be aware of the persistence of the male, anti-social stereotype within elements of the student body.","authors":["Gareth Schott","Neil Selwyn"],"meta":["December 2000Journal of Educational Computing Research 23(3):291-303","DOI:10.2190/V98R-5ETX-W9LY-WD3J"],"references":["233174888_A_Stereotype_in_the_Making_Girls_and_computers_in_primary_schools","27464893_Institutional_Discourse_and_Practice_A_Case_Study_of_The_Social_Construction_Of_Technological_Competence_In_The_Primary_Classroom","24098340_Characteristics_of_Adopters_and_Non-Adopters_of_Home_Computers","254272477_The_gender_factor_in_computer_anxiety_and_interest_among_some_Australian_high_school_students","248981193_Why_Do_Female_Students_Tend_to_Avoid_Computer_Studies","248968534_Chips_with_Everything_Personal_attributes_of_heavy_computer_users","248913945_Whats_in_the_Box_Exploring_Learners_Rejection_of_Educational_Computing","247494837_Discretionary_use_of_personal_computers_by_knowledge_workers_Testing_of_a_social_psychology_theoretical_model","242376321_Computers_and_Classroom_Culture","238705597_The_Persistence_of_the_Gender_Gap_in_Computing","235955065_The_Relationship_Between_Personality_and_Computer_Related_Attitudes_of_Israeli_Teachers","233029348_Personality_Characteristics_of_Junior_High_School_Students_Successful_with_Computers","232602525_The_stereotype_of_the_computer_scientist","227977045_Factors_affecting_microcomputer_use_and_programming_ability_of_secondary_school_children","227259261_Boys_girls_and_microcomputing","223001705_Gender-Based_Differences_in_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","222856914_Gender_Differences_and_Similarities_in_Attitudes_toward_Computers","222727256_Students'_attitudes_toward_computers_Validation_of_a_computer_attitude_scale_for_16-19_education","222150635_The_Etiology_of_Computerphobia","220260353_Personal_Computing_Toward_a_Conceptual_Model_of_Utilization"]}
