{"id":"334381789_Application_of_Deep_Learning_in_Integrated_Pest_Management_A_Real-Time_System_for_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_Oilseed_Rape_Pests","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed an approach to detect oilseed rape pests based on deep learning, which improves the mean average precision (mAP) to 77.14%; the result increased by 9.7% with the original model. We adopt this model to mobile platform to let every farmer able to use this program, which will diagnose pests in real time and provide suggestions on pest controlling. We designed an oilseed rape pest imaging database with 12 typical oilseed rape pests and compared the performance of five models, SSD w/Inception is chosen as the optimal model. Moreover, for the purpose of the high mAP, we have used data augmentation (DA) and added a dropout layer. The experiments are performed on the Android application we developed, and the result shows that our approach surpasses the original model obviously and is helpful for integrated pest management. This application has improved environmental adaptability, response speed, and accuracy by contrast with the past works and has the advantage of low cost and simple operation, which are suitable for the pest monitoring mission of drones and Internet of Things (IoT).","authors":["Yong He","Hong Zeng","Yangyang Fan","Shuaisheng Ji"],"meta":["July 2019Mobile Information Systems 2019:1-14","DOI:10.1155/2019/4570808"],"references":["329039476_Autonomous_garbage_detection_for_intelligent_urban_management","325808679_Emotion_Classification_with_Data_Augmentation_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","325062365_A_Vision-Based_Counting_and_Recognition_System_for_Flying_Insects_in_Intelligent_Agriculture","324693641_Image_recognition_method_of_multi-cluster_kiwifruit_in_field_based_on_convolutional_neural_networks","324084617_Research_on_Daily_Objects_Detection_Based_on_Deep_Neural_Network","323510048_TSSD_Temporal_Single-Shot_Detector_Based_on_Attention_and_LSTM_for_Robotic_Intelligent_Perception","322895764_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Vision_A_Brief_Review","322579889_The_use_of_plant_models_in_deep_learning_An_application_to_leaf_counting_in_rosette_plants","330708842_Object_Detection_With_Deep_Learning_A_Review","329488196_R-fcn_Object_detection_via_region-based_fully_convolutional_networks"]}
