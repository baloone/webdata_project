{"id":"261375073_The_Ordered_Clustered_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"The ordered clustered travelling salesman problem is a variation of the usual travelling salesman problem in which a set of vertices (except the starting vertex) of the network is divided into some prespecified clusters. The objective is to find the least cost Hamiltonian tour in which vertices of any cluster are visited contiguously and the clusters are visited in the prespecified order. The problem is NP-hard, and it arises in practical transportation and sequencing problems. This paper develops a hybrid genetic algorithm using sequential constructive crossover, 2-opt search, and a local search for obtaining heuristic solution to the problem. The efficiency of the algorithm has been examined against two existing algorithms for some asymmetric and symmetric TSPLIB instances of various sizes. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in terms of solution quality and computational time. Finally, we present solution to some more symmetric TSPLIB instances.","authors":["Zakir Hussain Ahmed"],"meta":["February 2014The Scientific World Journal 2014(2):258207","DOI:10.1155/2014/258207","SourcePubMed"],"references":["274310090_A_hybrid_sequential_constructive_sampling_algorithm_for_the_bottleneck_traveling_salesman_problem","264834822_Multi-parent_extension_of_sequential_constructive_crossover_for_the_travelling_salesman_problem","262237452_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Bottleneck_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","257885945_An_experimental_study_of_a_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_for_the_maximum_traveling_salesman_problem","257790019_An_exact_algorithm_for_the_clustered_travelling_salesman_problem","310795268_An_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","266720652_The_Clustered_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_Genetic_Approach","262405039_A_Novel_Ant_Colony_System_Based_on_Minimum_1-Tree_and_Hybrid_Mutation_for_TSP","262311360_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Clustered_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_a_Prespecified_Order_on_the_Clusters"]}
