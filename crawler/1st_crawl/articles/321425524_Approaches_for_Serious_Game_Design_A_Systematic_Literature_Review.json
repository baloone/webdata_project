{"id":"321425524_Approaches_for_Serious_Game_Design_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"In this review, the authors analyzed the main features of the design of serious games that promote learning in an academic setting. The purpose of this study is to establish the approaches described in the literature, regarding the methodologies, frameworks, and models applied to game designs, and highlight phases of game development software that improves the learning processes that go hand in hand with the learning objectives. The result of this work identifies 51 potential studies, within the period: 2008-2016, using various well-known digital libraries. The analysis of the selected documents applying the inclusion criteria resulted in 11 approaches that are used for the design of serious games. Additionally, it was possible to identify 31 stages proposed in the documents for the development of the educational game, as well as pedagogical aspects related to learning strategies and educational theories and several key factors that influence the design of serious games.","authors":["Diego Fernando Avila Pesantez","Luis A Rivera"],"meta":["September 2017Computers in Education Journal 8(3)"],"references":["311491157_SEGA-ARM_A_Metamodel_for_the_Design_of_Serious_Games_to_Support_Auditory_Rehabilitation","309893974_Game_Development_Software_Engineering_Process_Life_Cycle_A_Systematic_Review","304396696_Towards_a_Methodology_for_Serious_Games_Design_for_Children_with_Auditory_Impairments","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","301792829_From_Game_Design_to_Service_Design_A_Framework_to_Gamify_Services","300631841_Adopting_Best_Practices_from_the_Games_Industry_in_Development_of_Serious_Games_for_Health","300141347_Towards_Design_Patterns_for_Augmented_Reality_Serious_Games","299640989_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Serious_Game_Based_on_Kinect","307874705_Design_methodology_for_educational_games_based_on_graphical_notations_Designing_Urano","307802160_Educational_game_design_using_the_7_steps_for_designing_serious_games_method_Case_study_Mathematical_subject_on_comparison_and_scale_material_for_7th_grade_junior_high_school"]}
