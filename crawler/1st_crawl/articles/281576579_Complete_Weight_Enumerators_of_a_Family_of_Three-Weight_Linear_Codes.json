{"id":"281576579_Complete_Weight_Enumerators_of_a_Family_of_Three-Weight_Linear_Codes","abstract":"Linear codes have been an interesting topic in both theory and practice for\nmany years. In this paper, for an odd prime p, we present the explicit complete\nweight enumerator of a family of p-ary linear codes constructed with defining\nset. The weight enumerator is an immediate result of the complete weight\nenumerator which shows that the codes proposed in this paper are three-weight\nlinear codes. Additionally, all nonzero codewords are minimal and thus they are\nsuitable for secret sharing schemes.","authors":["Yang Shudi","Zheng-an Yao"],"meta":["March 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 82(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0191-x","SourcearXiv","Project: linear codes"],"references":["282452922_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_some_linear_codes_and_their_applications","277947569_Recent_progress_on_weight_distributions_of_cyclic_codes_over_finite_fields","274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","312433866_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_generalized_Kerdock_code_and_linear_recursive_codes_over_Galois_rings","277335146_Complete_Weight_Enumerators_of_Some_Linear_Codes","276443210_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_some_cyclic_codes","274012549_Linear_Codes_From_Some_2-Designs","273395796_Binary_Linear_Codes_With_Three_Weights","271096429_The_weight_distribution_of_a_family_of_p-ary_cyclic_codes","268167024_Codes_from_Difference_Sets"]}
