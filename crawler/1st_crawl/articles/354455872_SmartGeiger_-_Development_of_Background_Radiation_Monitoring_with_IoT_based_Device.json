{"id":"354455872_SmartGeiger_-_Development_of_Background_Radiation_Monitoring_with_IoT_based_Device","abstract":"Ionizing radiations have hazardous health effects upon human beings. Different types of cancers and genetic mutations may arise from the overexposure to ionizing radiations like alpha-particles, beta-particles, gamma-rays, x-rays etc. For this reason, it is necessary to measure the background radiation of each place and that can be done by a Geiger Muller (GM) counter. This paper describes the development of a Geiger Mueller counter with ESP32 microcontroller and also a user-friendly dashboard with Node-RED. A microcontroller electronic circuit for the monitoring radiation system with an operation algorithm with micropython programming language is developed.","authors":["Ahnaf Tahmid Chowdhury","Md.
