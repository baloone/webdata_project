{"id":"293286938_Reverse_engineering_of_solid_models","abstract":"This paper presents an overview of the work done in the Robotics and CAD Laboratory on developing tools for automatic construction of CAD models from existing information. These include engineering drawings and point data measured off the physical prototype. Some of the tools developed are of value not only in CAD as a flexible and efficient means of constructing 3D computer models of existing parts, but also in product development especially for outsourcing of tooling and components, automatic inspection and verification in manufacturing, and model-based vision.","authors":["B.
