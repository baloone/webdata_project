{"id":"221466389_An_Ontology_Mapping_Algorithm_between_Heterogeneous_Product_Classification_Taxonomies","abstract":"Research on ontology merging and mapping is one of the most im- portant issues in the Semantic Web because ontologies are developed and used by various sites and organizations respectively. Electronic commerce is the area that require ontology mapping on product comparison over different product classification taxonomies of various shopping malls. But, a strict mapping strat- egy may lead a customer's configuration to search failure. Therefore we sug- gest a mapping algorithm for product matching that can provide more products by increasing sensitivity with reasonable decrease of specificity. We performed a comparative evaluation between our algorithm and PROMPT with 6 experi- mental sets.","authors":["Wooju Kim","Sangun Park","Siri Bang","Sunghwan Lee"],"meta":["January 2006","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Ontology Matching (OM-2006) Collocated with the 5th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC-2006), Athens, Georgia, USA, November 5, 2006"],"references":["288392304_Ontology_mapping_The_state_of_the_art","237037192_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Interoperability_New_Approaches_to_Knowledge_and_the_Semantic_Web","222410003_The_PROMPT_suite_Interactive_tools_for_ontology_merging_and_mapping","220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","200044309_WordNet_A_Lexical_Database_for_English","2605369_Ontology_Mapping_-_An_Integrated_Approach"]}
