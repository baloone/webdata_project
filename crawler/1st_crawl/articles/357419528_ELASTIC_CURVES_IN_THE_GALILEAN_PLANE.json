{"id":"357419528_ELASTIC_CURVES_IN_THE_GALILEAN_PLANE","abstract":"An elastic curve or elastica introduced by Jacques Bernoulli in 1692 is the solution of a variational problem which minimizes the integral of the total squared curvature for curves of a fixed length satisfying given first order boundary conditions. Many works related to elastica problem, which plays a large role in many area such as engineering, computer science, biology, chemistry, ship building, bridges, DNA etc. in our life have been done by many researchers in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces. In this work, we consider the classical variational problem in the Galilean plane. We derive Euler-Lagrange equation as a second order differential equation. Then, we obtain the curvature of the elastic curves parameterized by arc length in such a plane. Next, we give an example which represents the position vector of an elastic curve in explicit form in the Galilean plane.","authors":["Gülçin Çivi Bilir","İlayda Altinkol","Altuğ Beyhan"],"meta":["November 2021"],"references":["254206292_The_total_squared_curvature_of_closed_curves","249088884_Leonhard_Euler's_Elastic_Curves","242802838_Evolution_of_inelastic_plane_curves","237105918_The_elastica_A_mathematical_history"]}
