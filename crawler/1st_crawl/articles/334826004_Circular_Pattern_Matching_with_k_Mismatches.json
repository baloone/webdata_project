{"id":"334826004_Circular_Pattern_Matching_with_k_Mismatches","abstract":"The k-mismatch problem consists in computing the Hamming distance between a pattern P of length m and every length-m substring of a text T of length n, if this distance is no more than k. In many real-world applications, any cyclic shift of P is a relevant pattern, and thus one is interested in computing the minimal distance of every length-m substring of T and any cyclic shift of P. This is the circular pattern matching with k mismatches (k-CPM) problem. A multitude of papers have been devoted to solving this problem but, to the best of our knowledge, only average-case upper bounds are known. In this paper, we present the first non-trivial worst-case upper bounds for the k-CPM problem. Specifically, we show an -time algorithm and an -time algorithm. The latter algorithm applies in an extended way a technique that was very recently developed for the k-mismatch problem [Bringmann et al., SODA 2019].","authors":["Panagiotis Charalampopoulos","Tomasz Kociumaka","Solon P.
