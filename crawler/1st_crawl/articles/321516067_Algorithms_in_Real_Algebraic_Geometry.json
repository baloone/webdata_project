{"id":"321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","abstract":"The algorithmic problems of real algebraic geometry such as real root counting, deciding the existence of solutions of systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, or deciding whether two points belong in the same connected component of a semi-algebraic set occur in many contexts. In this first-ever graduate textbook on the algorithmic aspects of real algebraic geometry, the main ideas and techniques presented form a coherent and rich body of knowledge, linked to many areas of mathematics and computing.\nMathematicians already aware of real algebraic geometry will find relevant information about the algorithmic aspects, and researchers in computer science and engineering will find the required mathematical background.\nBeing self-contained the book is accessible to graduate students and even, for invaluable parts of it, to undergraduate students.","authors":["Saugata Basu","Richard Pollack","Marie-FrancoÌ§ise Roy"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-05355-3"],"references":[]}
