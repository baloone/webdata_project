{"id":"331264799_Network_Embedding_via_Community_Based_Variational_Autoencoder","abstract":"In recent years, network embedding has attracted more and more attention due to its effectiveness and convenience to compress the network structured data. In this paper, we propose a community based variational autoencoder model (ComVAE) to learn network embedding, which consists of a community detection module and a deep learning module. In the proposed model, both community information and deep learning techniques are utilized to learn low-dimensional vertex representations. Firstly, community information reveals implicit relationship between vertices from a global view, which can be a supplement to local information and help to improve the embedding quality. To obtain the community information, community detection algorithms are utilized as a module and the modularization design makes the model more flexible. Secondly, deep learning techniques can not only integrate and preserve the information from both local and global views efficiently, but also strengthen the robustness of vertex representations. To demonstrate the performance of our model, extensive experiments are conducted in four downstream tasks, namely network reconstruction, node classification, link prediction and visualization. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets.","authors":["Wei Shi","Ling Huang","Chang-Dong Wang","Juan-Hui Li"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900662"],"references":["328033542_Learning_Heterogeneous_Network_Embedding_From_Text_and_Links","326203987_Galaxy_Network_Embedding_A_Hierarchical_Community_Structure_Preserving_Approach","326043728_Representing_Graphs_as_Bag_of_Vertices_and_Partitions_for_Graph_Classification","320885185_From_Properties_to_Links_Deep_Network_Embedding_on_Incomplete_Graphs","315472176_PPNE_Property_Preserving_Network_Embedding","313628491_Community_Preserving_Network_Embedding","310825144_Asymmetric_Transitivity_Preserving_Graph_Embedding","303495864_deep_neural_network_for_learning_graph_representations","301704314_Detection_of_Co-salient_Objects_by_Looking_Deep_and_Wide","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","221653118_Relational_learning_via_latent_social_dimensions","220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","5915527_Near_Linear_Time_Algorithm_to_Detect_Community_Structures_in_Large-Scale_Networks","1913681_Fast_Unfolding_of_Communities_in_Large_Networks","350961842_Attributed_Network_Embedding_with_Micro-Meso_Structure","331417912_Overlapping_Community_Detection_in_Multi-view_Brain_Network","330031704_A_Harmonic_Motif_Modularity_Approach_for_Multi-layer_Network_Community_Detection","326137768_BiNE_Bipartite_Network_Embedding","325703508_Multimodal_Network_Embedding_via_Attention_based_Multi-view_Variational_Autoencoder","325375398_Deep_Dynamic_Network_Embedding_for_Link_Prediction","322592220_Network_Representation_Learning_A_Survey","320014532_A_Comprehensive_Survey_of_Graph_Embedding_Problems_Techniques_and_Applications","318740710_Variation_Autoencoder_Based_Network_Representation_Learning_for_Classification","317405790_Discriminative_Metric_Learning_for_Multi-view_Graph_Partitioning","310824980_Structural_Deep_Network_Embedding","307870837_Learning_Rotation-Invariant_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection_in_VHR_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images","305997704_node2vec_Scalable_Feature_Learning_for_Networks","303027834_Co-Saliency_Detection_via_a_Self-Paced_Multiple-Instance_Learning_Framework","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","263316327_Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Deep_Generative_Models","259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","236139958_Representing_and_Retrieving_Video_Shots_in_Human-Centric_Brain_Imaging_Space","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","5635994_Maps_of_Random_Walks_on_Complex_Networks_Reveal_Community_Structure","2439047_Autoencoders_Minimum_Description_Length_and_Helmholtz_Free_Energy"]}
