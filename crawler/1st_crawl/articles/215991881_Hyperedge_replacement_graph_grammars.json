{"id":"215991881_Hyperedge_replacement_graph_grammars","abstract":"In this survey the concept of hyperedge replacement is presented as an elementary approach to graph and hypergraph generation. In particular, hyperedge replace- ment graph grammars are discussed as a (hyper)graph-grammatical counterpart to context-free string grammars. To cover a large part of the theory of hyperedge re- placement, structural properties and decision problems, including the membership problem, are addressed.","authors":["Frank Drewes","Hans-Joerg Kreowski","Annegret Habel"],"meta":["February 1997","DOI:10.1142/9789812384720_0002","SourceOAI","In book: Handbook of graph grammars and computing by graph transformation (pp.95-162)Publisher: World ScientificEditors: G Rozenberg"],"references":["268999373_Rule_Trees_Represent_Derivations_in_Edge_Replacement_Systems","266518765_Parallel_Hyperedge_Replacement","265637707_Infinite_hypergraphs_I_Basic_properties","245991391_Efficient_analysis_of_graph_properties_on_context-free_graph_languages","242529244_Context-free_gmph_grammar","234810594_Graph-Grammars_and_Their_Application_to_Computer_Science","234789568_Formal_Languages_and_Their_Relation_to_Automata","232627399_DiaGen_A_generator_for_diagram_editors_providing_direct_manipulation_and_execution_of_diagrams","230875835_On_Formal_Properties_of_Simple_Phrase_Structure_Grammars","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","223852014_A_Comparison_of_Boundary_Graph_Grammars_and_Context-Free_Hypergraph_Grammars","227322434_Finite_tree_automata_with_cost_functions","227117266_An_axiomatic_definition_of_context-free_rewriting_and_its_application_to_NLC_graph_grammars","225249247_Counter_machines_and_counter_languages","223847115_Decidable_boundedness_problems_for_sets_of_graphs_generated_by_hyperedge-replacement"]}
