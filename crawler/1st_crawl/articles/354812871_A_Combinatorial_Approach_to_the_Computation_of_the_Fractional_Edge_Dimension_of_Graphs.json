{"id":"354812871_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_the_Computation_of_the_Fractional_Edge_Dimension_of_Graphs","abstract":"E. Yi recently introduced the fractional edge dimension of graphs. It has many applications in different areas of computer science such as in sensor networking, intelligent systems, optimization, and robot navigation. In this paper, the fractional edge dimension of vertex and edge transitive graphs is calculated. The class of hypercube graph Qn with an odd number of vertices n is discussed. We propose the combinatorial criterion for the calculation of the fractional edge dimension of a graph, and hence applied it to calculate the fractional edge dimension of the friendship graph Fk and the class of circulant graph Cn(1,2).","authors":["Nosheen Goshi","Sohail Zafar","Tabasam Rashid","Juan L.
