{"id":"252443814_The_Arpes_Experiment_and_the_Gap_Symmetry","abstract":"In this contribution, the peak position of the spectral function in the ARPES spectrum has been calculated for several gap symmetries and electronic band structures. As a result, the d wave, s + id and s* + id symmetries appear to be consistent with ARPES results. An additional comparison with previous calculations of the specific heat in normal and superconducting states as well as the single particle tunnelling current, reveals the existence of two characteristic temperatures, intrinsically associated with the Van Hove Singularity.","authors":["David Quesada"],"meta":["January 2003International Journal of Modern Physics B 17:3559-3562"],"references":[]}
