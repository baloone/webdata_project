{"id":"307530572_A_CONCEPTUAL_MODEL_FOR_THE_REPRESENTATION_OF_LANDFORMS_USING_ONTOLOGY_DESIGN_PATTERNS","abstract":"A landform is an area of a terrain with its own recognisable shape. Its definition is often qualitative and inherently vague. Hence landforms are difficult to formalise in view of their extraction from a DTM. This paper presents a two-level framework for the representation of landforms. The objective is to provide a structure where landforms can be conceptually designed according to a common model which can be implemented. It follows the principle that landforms are not defined by geometrical characteristics but by salient features perceived by people. Hence, these salient features define a skeleton around which the landform is built. The first level of our model defines general concepts forming a landform prototype while the second level provides a model for the translation of these concepts and landform extraction on a DTM. The model is still under construction and preliminary results together with current developments are also presented.","authors":["Eric Guilbert","Bernard Moulin","Andrés Camilo Cortés Murcia"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.5194/isprsannals-III-2-15-2016"],"references":["285277487_A_science_of_topography_from_qualitative_ontology_to_digital_representations","270581891_An_Ontology_for_Submarine_Feature_Representation_on_Charts","260031735_Geomorphology_of_the_oceans","257564381_Multi-level_representation_of_terrain_features_on_a_contour_map","252978873_A_Survey_of_Geospatial_Resources_Representation_and_Reasoning","313719888_Ontology-driven_geographic_information_systems","309053489_Algorithms_for_Extracting_Correct_Critical_Points_and_Constructing_Topological_Graphs_from_Discrete_Geographical_Elevation_Data","274695118_Submarine_canyons_and_channels_in_the_Lower_St_Lawrence_Estuary_Eastern_Canada_Morphology_classification_and_recent_sediment_dynamics","274457421_Morphological_Modeling_of_Terrains_and_Volume_Data","264352423_A_Voronoi-Based_Approach_to_Generating_Depth-Contours_for_Hydrographic_Charts"]}
