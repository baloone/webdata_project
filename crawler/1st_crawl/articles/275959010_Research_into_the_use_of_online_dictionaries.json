{"id":"275959010_Research_into_the_use_of_online_dictionaries","abstract":"Studies on dictionary use have been gaining ground over the last three decades or so, but while dictionary use has moved dynamically\ninto the digital medium, user research on digital dictionaries has been somewhat slow in coming. In view of this, the first\nbook-length work on the use of online dictionaries (Müller-Spitzer 2014) is particularly welcome. The present article undertakes\na detailed critical review of the studies included in the volume, set in the more general context of the study of the use\nof digital dictionaries. It also includes suggestions for future research avenues.","authors":["Robert Lew"],"meta":["June 2015International Journal of Lexicography 28(2):232–253","DOI:10.1093/ijl/ecv010"],"references":["285785282_User_Consultation_Behaviour_in_Internet_Dictionaries_An_Eye-Tracking_Study","274717717_Observing_Online_Dictionary_Users_Studies_Using_Wiktionary_Log_Files","273131442_The_Effect_of_Menus_and_Signposting_on_the_Speed_and_Accuracy_of_Sense_Selection","272453081_Reflections_on_Lexicographical_User_Research","271897393_The_use_of_corpus_examples_for_language_comprehension_and_production","265254332_A_case_for_bilingual_learners'_dictionaries","265252063_How_Dictionary_Users_Choose_Senses_in_Bilingual_Dictionary_Entries_An_Eye-Tracking_Study","292715164_The_Use_of_Bilingual_Dictionaries_by_ESL_Students_while_Writing","276333897_Colours_in_Online_Dictionaries_A_Case_of_Functional_Labels","273857123_Application_Of_Eye-Tracking_In_Efl_Learners'_Dictionary_Look-Up_Process_Research","265251983_Opportunities_and_limitations_of_user_studies","254217234_Testing_aspects_of_the_usability_of_an_online_learner_dictionary_prototype_A_product-_and_process-oriented_study","228344916_Do_dictionary_users_really_look_up_frequent_words_On_the_overestimation_of_the_value_of_corpus-based_lexicography","49249794_Studies_in_Dictionary_Use_Recent_Developments","13802902_A_Limit_on_Behavioral_Plasticity_in_Speech_Perception"]}
