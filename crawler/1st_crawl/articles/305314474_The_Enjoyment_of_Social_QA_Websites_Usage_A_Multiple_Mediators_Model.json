{"id":"305314474_The_Enjoyment_of_Social_QA_Websites_Usage_A_Multiple_Mediators_Model","abstract":"Drawing on recent developments in media entertainment research, this study examined the relationship between social question and answer (Q&A) websites use and users’ perceived enjoyment with the goal of expanding the line of research on the enjoyment of new and interactive forms of media entertainment. Special attention was paid to meaningfulness, self-presentation, and social presence, which were introduced as mediators. An online survey of users of a social Q&A website was carried out (N = 150). Results indicated an indirect effect of social Q&A websites usage on enjoyment through users’ meaningfulness, self-presentation success, and social presence. Theoretical implications and further directions were discussed in detail.","authors":["Qihao Ji","Di Cui"],"meta":["July 2016Bulletin of Science Technology & Society 36(2)","DOI:10.1177/0270467616658744"],"references":["289317820_Social_Network_Site_Use_among_Dutch_Students_Effects_of_Time_and_Platform","275223520_Video_Games_as_Meaningful_Entertainment_Experiences","262418133_Entertainment_20_The_Role_of_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Need_Satisfaction_for_the_Enjoyment_of_Facebook_Use","254826051_Explaining_Knowledge_Sharing_The_Role_of_Team_Communication_Styles_Job_Satisfaction_and_Performance_Beliefs","254092756_At_Least_Nine_Ways_to_Play_Approaching_Gamer_Mentalities","241053908_Motivations_for_Answering_Questions_Online_Abstract","237531711_Self-Presentation_in_Online_PersonalsThe_Role_of_Anticipated_Future_Interaction_Self-Disclosure_and_Perceived_Success_in_Internet_Dating","233017141_Entertaining_Media_Use_and_the_Satisfaction_of_Recovery_Needs_Recovery_Outcomes_Associated_With_the_Use_of_Interactive_and_Noninteractive_Entertaining_Media","229981287_Defining_Media_Enjoyment_as_the_Satisfaction_of_Intrinsic_Needs","221789917_Me_and_My_400_Friends_The_Anatomy_of_College_Students'_Facebook_Networks_Their_Communication_Patterns_and_Well-Being","221515297_Predictors_of_Answer_Quality_in_Online_QA_Sites","220453541_Political_blog_readers_Predictors_of_motivations_for_accessing_political_blogs","220433537_Self-Presentation_and_the_Value_of_Information_in_QA_Websites","220146597_User-centered_evaluation_of_information_A_research_challenge","220055101_The_Role_of_Social_Presence_in_Establishing_Loyalty_in_e-Service_Environments","215640132_Unterhaltung_online_-_Motive_Erleben_Effekte","200772483_Voluntary_Engagement_in_an_Open_Web-Based_Encyclopedia_Wikipedians_and_Why_They_Do_It","200772411_The_Networked_Minds_Measure_of_Social_Presence_Pilot_Test_of_the_Factor_Structure_and_Concurrent_Validity","19356291_The_Moderator-Mediator_Variable_Distinction_in_Social_Psychological_Research","288023655_The_psychology_of_disposition-based_theories_of_media_enjoyment","283437795_Mood_Management_in_the_Context_of_Selective_Exposure_Theory","282633232_Why_users_contribute_knowledge_to_online_communities_An_empirical_study_of_an_online_social_QA_community","276043146_Investigating_Motivations_and_Expectations_of_Asking_a_Question_in_Social_QA","264339853_Effectiveness_of_Politicians'_Soft_Campaign_on_Twitter_Versus_TV_Cognitive_and_Experiential_Routes","263468552_Cultural_Differences_in_Preference_for_Entertainment_Messages_That_Induce_Mixed_Responses_of_Joy_and_Sorrow","256600143_The_Presentation_of_Self_In_Everyday_Life","247503437_Punishing_Media_Criminals_and_Moral_Judgment_The_Impact_on_Enjoyment","245572974_YouTube_Users_Watching_and_Sharing_the_News_A_Uses_and_Gratifications_Approach","242919545_The_Cyborg's_Dilemma_Progressive_Embodiment_in_Virtual_Environments_1","237224875_Beyond_Baron_and_Kenny_Statistical_Mediation_Analysis_in_the_New_Millennium","235584273_The_Cyborg's_Dilemma_Progressive_Embodiment_in_Virtual_Environments","232578613_Appreciation_of_Entertainment_The_Importance_of_Meaningfulness_via_Virtue_and_Wisdom","230271953_Entertainment_as_Pleasurable_and_Meaningful_Identifying_Hedonic_and_Eudaimonic_Motivations_for_Entertainment_Consumption","229879859_Avatar-Mediated_Networking_Increasing_Social_Presence_and_Interpersonal_Trust_in_Net-Based_Collaborations","229457802_Privacy_and_Self-Disclosure_in_Social_Relationships","229359487_Research_agenda_for_Social_QA","227918475_Appreciation_as_Audience_Response_Exploring_Entertainment_Gratifications_Beyond_Hedonism","227793488_Social_QA","227690950_Toward_a_Theory_of_Entertainment_Persuasion_Explaining_the_Persuasive_Effects_of_Entertainment-Education_Messages","221514776_What_Do_People_Ask_Their_Social_Networks_and_Why_A_Survey_Study_of_Status_Message_QA_Behavior","220432910_How_and_Why_Do_College_Students_Use_Wikipedia","220167918_Exploring_Characteristics_and_Effects_of_User_Participation_in_Online_Social_QA_Sites","220140431_Investigating_factors_that_influence_social_presence_and_learning_outcomes_in_distance_higher_education","29442519_Addressing_Moderated_Mediation_Hypotheses_Theory_Methods_and_Prescriptions","8090745_SPSS_and_SAS_Procedures_for_Estimating_Indirect_Effects_in_Simple_Mediation_Models"]}
