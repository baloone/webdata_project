{"id":"301248720_An_Improved_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_Based_on_Bat_Algorithm","abstract":"In the DV-Hop algorithm, the average distance per hop is one of the factors that affect the accuracy of the positioning. In this paper, an improved DV-Hop localization algorithm based on bat algorithm (BAD-Hop) is proposed to solve the error which is brought by the average distance per hop. In BAD-Hop algorithm, bat algorithm which is a kind of intelligent optimization algorithm with good performance is introduced into DV-Hop localization algorithm to calculate average distance per hop of anchor nodes. Firstly, the average distance per hop of anchor node is calculated by using bat algorithm, which makes it closer to the actual value. Then the average distance per hop of the unknown node is weighted by using the average distance per hop of anchor nodes which hop-count is less than or equal to 3 to reduce errors caused by average distance per hop. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can effectively reduce the positioning error without additional hardware.","authors":["Xiaoying Yang","Wanli Zhang"],"meta":["April 2016Cybernetics and Information Technologies 16(1)","DOI:10.1515/cait-2016-0007"],"references":["287008037_An_optimized_k-means_clustering_technique_using_bat_algorithm","236020593_Energy_consumption_heuristics_in_wireless_sensor_networks","236005954_Sentry_Based_Intruder_Detection_Technique_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","233780272_Bat_Algorithm_A_Novel_Approach_for_Global_Engineering_Optimization","3199347_Communication_Paradigms_for_Sensor_Networks","312703372_Improvement_of_DV-Hop_localization_based_on_shuffled_frog_leaping_algorithm","309777445_Localization_of_sensor_nodes_using_modified_particle_swarm_optimization_in_wireless_sensor_networks","290730276_Localization_method_based_on_modified_particle_swarm_optimization_for_wireless_sensor_networks","285458071_An_improved_DV-Hop_algorithm_based_on_genetic_algorithm","280759005_New_version_of_AES-ECC_encryption_system_based_on_FPGA_in_WSNs"]}
