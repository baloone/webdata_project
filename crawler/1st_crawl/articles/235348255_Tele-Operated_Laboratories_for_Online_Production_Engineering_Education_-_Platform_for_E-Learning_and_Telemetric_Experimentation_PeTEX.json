{"id":"235348255_Tele-Operated_Laboratories_for_Online_Production_Engineering_Education_-_Platform_for_E-Learning_and_Telemetric_Experimentation_PeTEX","abstract":"The development of tele-operated experimentation and its provision to distance learners opens new dimensions for experience-based scientific and engineering education, particularly where experiments are the core elements of teaching and learning. The finalized EU-funded project PeTEXâ€“Platform for e-Learning and Telemetric Experimentation has developed a prototype of an e-learning platform\nbased on the learning and content management system Moodle for the design and implementation of educational and training applications in the field of production engineering. The principle goal of this project was to establish individual and group oriented learning for different target groups like students and professional workers within a platform-system capable to serve a multi-lingual learning community. Hence, an educational model was designed which integrates the tele-operated experimentation platform with teaching content and learning activities in order to support a successful learning walkthrough for different target groups.","authors":["Claudius Terkowsky","Christian Pleul","Isa Jahnke","A.
