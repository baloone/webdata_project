{"id":"322018958_A_comparative_study_of_LPWAN_technologies_for_large-scale_IoT_deployment","abstract":"By 2020, more than 50 billion devices will be connected through radio communications. In conjunction with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) market, low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have become a popular low-rate long-range radio communication technology. Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT are the three leading LPWAN technologies that compete for large-scale IoT deployment. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service. In addition, we analyze the IoT success factors of these LPWAN technologies, and we consider application scenarios and explain which technology is the best fit for each of these scenarios.","authors":["Kais Mekki","Eddy Bajic","Frédéric Chaxel","Fernand Meyer"],"meta":["March 2019ICT Express 5(1):1-7","DOI:10.1016/j.icte.2017.12.005"],"references":["317040564_Experimental_Study_on_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks_LPWAN_for_Mobile_Internet_of_Things","315505158_A_survey_on_LPWA_technology_LoRa_and_NB-IoT","321121298_Experimental_Study_on_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks_LPWAN_for_Mobile_Internet_of_Things","316722170_Evaluation_of_LPWAN_Technologies_for_Smart_Cities_River_Monitoring_Use-Case","315472743_Performance_Evaluation_of_NB-IoT_Coverage","312450467_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks_An_Overview","310782997_An_efficient_small_data_transmission_scheme_in_the_3GPP_NB-IoT_system","308840876_Overview_of_LTE_enhancements_for_cellular_IoT","308743909_Long-Range_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Geo-location_Tracking_Design_and_Evaluation","304665002_Range_and_coexistence_analysis_of_long_range_unlicensed_communication"]}
