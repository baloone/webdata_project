{"id":"266309691_Generation_of_molecular_graphs_with_a_given_set_of_nonoverlapping_fragments","abstract":"An extension of algorithm and program GENM for molecular graph generation is described. It provides effective construction of graphs containing the set of nonoverlapping fragments. Examples of isomer generation based on various sets of fragments and corresponding computer time are given.","authors":["Sergey G Molodtsov"],"meta":["January 1994MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 30"],"references":[]}
