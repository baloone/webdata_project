{"id":"316434547_A_Comprehensive_Framework_of_Information_System_Design_to_Provide_Organizational_Creativity_Support","abstract":"This research is motivated by two considerations: (1) organizational creativity is a component that enhances the ability of organizations to retain their competitive advantage and (2) too little research has been conducted worldwide that focuses on the design of information systems to provide organizational creativity support. This research proposes a comprehensive and conceptual framework for the design of organizational creativity support systems. To address the objective of this study, two theories, the resource-based view and a multiagent approach, are used to build the model proposed. The customer opinions from websites concerning a consumer electronics product are used to validate such a system. The theoretical contributions, practical implications, and future directions of the study are presented and discussed.","authors":["Celina M.
