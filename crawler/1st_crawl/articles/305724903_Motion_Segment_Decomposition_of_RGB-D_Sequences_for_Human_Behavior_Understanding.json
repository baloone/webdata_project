{"id":"305724903_Motion_Segment_Decomposition_of_RGB-D_Sequences_for_Human_Behavior_Understanding","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing and understanding human behavior from depth videos. The proposed solution �rst employs shape analysis of the human pose across time to decompose the full motion into short temporal segments representing elementary motions. Then, each segment is characterized by human motion and depth appearance around hand joints to describe the change in pose of the body and the interaction with objects. Finally, the sequence of temporal segments is modeled through a Dynamic Naive\nBayes classi�er, which captures the dynamics of elementary motions characterizing\nhuman behavior. Experiments on four challenging datasets evaluate the potential of the proposed approach in di�erent contexts, including gesture or activity recognition and online activity detection. Competitive results in comparison with state of the art methods are reported.","authors":["Maxime Devanne","Stefano Berretti","Pietro Pala","Hazem Wannous"],"meta":["July 2016Pattern Recognition 61","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2016.07.041"],"references":["282569949_Combined_Shape_Analysis_of_Human_Poses_and_Motion_Units_for_Action_Segmentation_and_Recognition","278028021_Elastic_Functional_Coding_of_Human_Actions_From_Vector-Fields_to_Latent_Variables","309309732_Discriminative_orderlet_mining_for_real-time_recognition_of_human-object_interaction","295121883_Sequential_Max-Margin_Event_Detectors","292342918_A_Novel_Hierarchical_Framework_for_Human_Action_Recognition","292019817_Discriminative_Orderlet_Mining_for_Real-Time_Recognition_of_Human-Object_Interaction","289559149_Learning_spatio-temporal_structure_from_RGB-D_videos_for_human_activity_detection_and_anticipation","288989718_Robust_3D_Action_Recognition_with_Random_Occupancy_Patterns","286594066_Range-Sample_Depth_Feature_for_Action_Recognition","286593893_Super_Normal_Vector_for_Activity_Recognition_Using_Depth_Sequences"]}
