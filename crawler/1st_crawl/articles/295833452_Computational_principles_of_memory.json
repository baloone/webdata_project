{"id":"295833452_Computational_principles_of_memory","abstract":"The ability to store and later use information is essential for a variety of adaptive behaviors, including integration, learning, generalization, prediction and inference. In this Review, we survey theoretical principles that can allow the brain to construct persistent states for memory. We identify requirements that a memory system must satisfy and analyze existing models and hypothesized biological substrates in light of these requirements. We also highlight open questions, theoretical puzzles and problems shared with computer science and information theory.","authors":["Rishidev Chaudhuri","Ila Fiete"],"meta":["February 2016Nature Neuroscience 19(3):394-403","DOI:10.1038/nn.4237"],"references":["321058953_Compensation_for_PKMz_in_long-term_potentiation_and_spatial_long-term_memory_in_mutant_mice","285409735_A_memory_frontier_for_complex_synapses","283617646_Storing_Infinite_Numbers_of_Patterns_in_a_Spin-Glass_Model_of_Neural_Networks","278414493_Atypical_PKCs_in_memory_maintenance_The_roles_of_feedback_and_redundancy","278330980_The_CPEB3_Protein_Is_a_Functional_Prion_that_Interacts_with_the_Actin_Cytoskeleton","264197764_A_binary_Hopfield_network_with_1logn_information_rate_and_applications_to_grid_cell_decoding","259115099_The_synaptic_plasticity_and_memory_hypothesis_Encoding_storage_and_persistence","258959326_Optimizing_Working_Memory_with_Heterogeneity_of_Recurrent_Cortical_Excitation","258639149_Predictive_Coding_of_Dynamical_Variables_in_Balanced_Spiking_Networks","258348029_Context-dependent_computation_by_recurrent_dynamics_in_prefrontal_cortex","258098066_Dynamic_Flux_Tubes_Form_Reservoirs_of_Stability_in_Neuronal_Circuits","255954502_Dendritic_Generation_of_mGluR-Mediated_Slow_Afterdepolarization_in_Layer_5_Neurons_of_Prefrontal_Cortex","249320873_Specific_evidence_of_low-dimensional_continuous_attractor_dynamics_in_grid_cells","239030972_A_theory_of_Pavlovian_conditioning_The_effectiveness_of_reinforcement_and_non-reinforcement","235678256_Synaptic_Mechanisms_and_Network_Dynamics_Underlying_Spatial_Working_Memory_in_a_Cortical_Network_Model","316589030_Memory_Systems","311867879_Nanoconnectomic_upper_bound_on_the_variability_of_synaptic_plasticity","283788724_All-Optical_Interrogation_of_Neural_Circuits","281664344_Predicting_the_Dynamics_of_Network_Connectivity_in_the_Neocortex","280590474_Computational_principles_of_biological_memory","279730723_Structural_Components_of_Synaptic_Plasticity_and_Memory_Consolidation","278331005_The_Persistence_of_Hippocampal-Based_Memory_Requires_Protein_Synthesis_Mediated_by_the_Prion-like_Protein_CPEB3","277548745_S_HORT_-T_ERM_S_YNAPTIC_P_LASTICITY","277026866_The_Challenge_of_Understanding_the_Brain_Where_We_Stand_in_2015","276360593_Neural_dynamics_for_landmark_orientation_and_angular_path_integration","274602608_Robust_Persistent_Neural_Activity_in_a_Model_Integrator_with_Multiple_Hysteretic_Dendrites_per_Neuron","269760167_The_Organization_of_Behavior_A_Neuropsychological_Theory","269713235_Biochemical_principles_underlying_the_stable_maintenance_of_LTP_by_the_CaMKIINMDAR_complex","266151606_A_Tradeoff_Between_Accuracy_and_Flexibility_in_a_Working_Memory_Circuit_Endowed_with_Slow_Feedback_Mechanisms","264009220_A_Model_of_Grid_Cell_Development_through_Spatial_Exploration_and_Spike_Time-Dependent_Plasticity","262844786_Engineering_a_memory_with_LTD_and_LTP","261755985_Balance_and_Stability_of_Synaptic_Structures_during_Synaptic_Plasticity","261218415_The_Molecular_and_Systems_Biology_of_Memory","260039860_Bump_attractor_dynamics_in_prefrontal_cortex_explains_behavioral_precision_in_spatial_working_memory","258847270_Conditioned_Reflexes","257204350_Does_PKMzeta_maintain_memory","256329556_Identification_of_Long-Lived_Proteins_Reveals_Exceptional_Stability_of_Essential_Cellular_Structures","255975869_Balanced_cortical_microcircuitry_for_maintaining_information_in_working_memory","253648159_Proteostasis_in_complex_dendrites","253281142_The_Croonian_Lecture_La_Fine_Structure_Des_Centres_Nerveux","247602334_Reflexes_in_Response_to_Stretch_Myotatic_Reflexes","246804027_Memory_disturbance_after_bilateral_hippocampal_lesions","245641139_Chaos_in_neural_networks_with_balanced_excitatory_and_inhibitory_activity_Science","243773399_Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Chaos_With_Applications_to_Physics","243658817_A_Theory_of_Learning_and_Generalization","242868903_Neurobiology_Memory_and_molecular_turnover","240302952_Little_W_A_The_existence_of_persistent_states_in_the_brain_Math_Biosci_19_101-120","238722063_Neural_network_and_physical_systems_with_collective_computational_abilities","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","235240358_A_Neural_Substrate_of_Prediction_and_Reward","234042725_PKM-Z_is_not_required_for_hippocampal_synaptic_plasticity_learning_and_memory","234042723_Prkcz_null_mice_show_normal_learning_and_memory","233971673_Kinetic_Models_of_Synaptic_Transmission","233971709_Biophysics_of_Computation_Information_Processing_In_Single_Neurons","233971644_Local_cortical_circuits_An_electrophysiological_study"]}
