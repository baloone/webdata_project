The object of this article is precisely to illustrate, through a detailed case study, how a firm tried, from the 1960s, to manage a problem of environment between will of anticipation and constraints.\nIn order to be authorized to tip industrial wastes, called “red muds”, in the Mediterranean Sea, a large corporation used anticipatory but confined practices of social responsibility. The opponents’ contestations led the company to a real socio-technical controversy about its practices of responsibility. This one faced it up thanks to methods this time unevenly responsible.\nBeyond the historicity of CSR, this paper shows finally that the practical construction of this responsibility constitutes a difficult exercise and a complex phenomenon, even for a company initially full of willingness.","authors":["Marie-Claire Loison","Anne Pezet"],"meta":["December 2006","DOI:10.3917/eh.045.0097","Project: CSR and business history"],"references":["290457566_Mythes_et_realites_de_l'entreprise_responsable","250281741_L'alumine_a_Gardanne_de_1893_a_nos_jours_Une_traversee_industrielle_en_Provence","37415110_Agir_dans_un_Monde_Incertain_Essai_sur_la_Democratie_Technique"]}
