{"id":"309546034_Speech_Adjustments_for_Room_Acoustics_and_Their_Effects_on_Vocal_Effort","abstract":"Objectives: \nThe aims of the present study are (1) to analyze the effects of the acoustical environment and the voice style on time dose (Dt_p) and fundamental frequency (mean f0 and standard deviation std_f0) while taking into account the effect of short-term vocal fatigue and (2) to predict the self-reported vocal effort from the voice acoustical parameters.\n\nMethods: \nTen male and ten female subjects were recorded while reading a text in normal and loud styles, in three rooms-anechoic, semi-reverberant, and reverberant-with and without acrylic glass panels 0.5 m from the mouth, which increased external auditory feedback. Subjects quantified how much effort was required to speak in each condition on a visual analogue scale after each task.\n\nResults: \n(Aim1) In the loud style, Dt_p, f0, and std_f0 increased. The Dt_p was higher in the reverberant room compared to the other two rooms. Both genders tended to increase f0 in less reverberant environments, whereas a more monotonous speech was produced in rooms with greater reverberation. All three voice parameters increased with short-term vocal fatigue. (Aim2) A model of the vocal effort to acoustic vocal parameters is proposed. The sound pressure level contributed to 66% of the variance explained by the model, followed by the f0 (30%) and the modulation in amplitude (4%).\n\nConclusions: \nThe results provide insight into how voice acoustical parameters can predict vocal effort. In particular, it increased when SPL and f0 increased and when the amplitude voice modulation decreased.","authors":["Pasquale Bottalico"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.10.001"],"references":["279546803_Relative_Importance_for_Linear_Regression_in_R_The_Package_relaimpo","277539904_Determination_of_the_Rate_of_Change_of_Fundamental_Frequency_with_Respect_to_Subglottal_Air_Pressure_During_Sustained_Phonation","272518453_Duration_of_voicing_and_silence_periods_of_continuous_speech_in_different_acoustic_environments","51698375_Acoustic-phonetic_characteristics_of_speech_produced_with_communicative_intent_to_counter_adverse_listening_conditions","10580362_Vocal_Dose_Measures_Quantifying_Accumulated_Vibration_Exposure_in_Vocal_Fold_Tissues","303347636_Effects_of_speech_style_room_acoustics_and_vocal_fatigue_on_vocal_effort","277684787_Vocal_Dose_Measures_Quantifying_Accumulated_Vibration_Exposure_in_Vocal_Fold_Tissues","249558742_Sound_Pressure_Level_and_Duration","239959685_Effects_of_prolonged_oral_reading_on_F_0_SPL_subglottal_pressure_and_amplitude_characteristics_of_glottal_flow_waveforms","51035767_Vocal_effort_with_changing_talker-to-listener_distance_in_different_acoustic_environments","42305846_An_Approximate_Distribution_of_Estimates_of_Variance_Components","23135287_Acoustic_Correlates_of_Fatigue_in_Laryngeal_Muscles_Findings_for_a_Criterion-Based_Prevention_of_Acquired_Voice_Pathologies","11067217_Voice_changes_during_work_subjective_complaints_and_objective_measurements_for_female_primary_and_secondary_schoolteachers","8818950_Components_in_regression","7094891_External_and_internal_noise_surveys_of_London_primary_schools","6507165_Voicing_and_silence_periods_in_daily_and_weekly_vocalizations_of_teachers","3027229_A_New_Look_At_The_Statistical_Model_Identification"]}
