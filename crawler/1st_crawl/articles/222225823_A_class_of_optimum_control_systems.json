{"id":"222225823_A_class_of_optimum_control_systems","abstract":"A class of optimum control systems is defined and investigated with special emphasis on time-domain concepts. This class of optimum systems is particularly suitable for feedback-control applications where adaptability to changing conditions is desired.Computational and physical simplifications are studied when mathematical restrictions are imposed on the error criterion and the dynamic process. For a quadratic error criterion and a linear dynamic process, the optimum configuration of the control system is defined and discussed in terms of available measurements.For the case where, in addition, the control variable is not restricted in range, topics of separability and linearity are presented.","authors":["C.W.
