{"id":"220179921_Optimal_Superconvergence_Results_for_Delay_Integro-Differential_Equations_of_Pantograph_Type","abstract":"We analyze the optimal (global and local) orders of superconvergence of collocation solutions $u_{h}$ on uniform meshes $I_{h}$ for delay Volterra integro-differential equations with proportional delay functions given by $\\theta (t) = qt (0 < q < 1, t \\in [0,T])$. In particular, we show that if $u_{h}$ is a continuous piecewise polynomial of degree $m \\geq 2$, and if collocation is at the Gauss (-Legendre) points, then the (optimal) order of local superconvergence on $I_{h}$ is $p^{\\ast } = m+2$. It turns out that the same order $p^{\\ast }$ holds for nonlinear (strictly increasing) delay functions vanishing at $t = 0$. However, on judiciously chosen geometric meshes, collocation at the Gauss points yields the order $2m-\\varepsilon _{N}$, where $\\varepsilon _{N} \\rightarrow 0$ as the number $N$ of mesh points tends to infinity. Optimal local superconvergence results for the pantograph delay differential equation are obtained as special cases of our general analysis.","authors":["Hermann Brunner","Qiya Hu"],"meta":["January 2007SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 45(3):986-1004","DOI:10.1137/060660357","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265365344_Some_properties_of_the_functional_equation_phxfx_O_lx_gxyphydy","231873953_On_the_generalized_pantograph_functional-differential_equation","220179870_Discretized_Stability_and_Error_Growth_of_The_Nonautonomous_Pantograph_Equation","38372887_On_Pantograph_Integro-Differential_Equations","31370631_Stability_of_one-leg_TH-methods_for_the_variable_coefficient_pantograph_equation_on_the_quasi-geometric_mesh","284689219_Stability_analysis_of_th-methods_for_neutral_functional-differential_equations","284688911_The_functional-differential_equation_y'x_aylx_byx","268886419_Collocation_Methods_for_Volterra_Integral_and_Related_Functional_Equations","268553641_Short_proofs_and_a_counterexample_for_analytical_and_numerical_stability_of_delay_equations_with_infinite_memory","268020738_Time_transformations_for_delay_differential_equations","267669537_The_attainable_order_of_the_collocation_method_for_double-pantograph_delay_differential_equations","267666750_The_numerical_solution_of_neutral_Volterra_integro-differential_equations_with_delay_arguments","267443311_Collocation_approximations_for_second-order_differential_equations_and_Volterra_integro-differential_equations_with_variable_delays","267172376_On_a_Functional_Differential_Equation","266750943_Sur_une_equation_differentielle_fonctionnelle_analytique","266515448_The_discretizaton_of_Volterra_functional_integral_equations_with_proportional_delays","266515375_Runge-Kutta_Methods_for_Neutral_Differential_Equations","266214558_Stability_and_Asymptotic_Stability_of_Functional-Differential_Equations","266010458_Numerical_analysis_of_delay_differential_equations_with_variable_delays","248759347_One-step_collation_for_delay_differential_equations","243084046_Geometric_meshes_and_their_application_to_Volterra_integro-differential_equations_with_singularities","239284100_On_the_attainable_order_of_collocation_methods_for_pantograph_integro-differential_equations","231918053_The_numerical_analysis_of_functional_integral_and_integro-differential_equations_of_Volterra_type","227467520_Numerical_Methods_for_Delay_Differential_Equations","226993673_On_the_Attainable_Order_of_Collocation_Methods_for_Delay_Differential_Equations_with_Proportional_Delay","226455300_Stability_analysis_of-methodsfor_neutral_functional-differential_equations","226099475_Superconvergence_in_Collocation_Methods_on_Quasi-Graded_Meshes_for_Functional_Differential_Equations_with_Vanishing_Delays","225796359_On_the_discretization_of_differential_and_Volterra_integral_equations_with_variable_delay","223661966_On_Neutral_Functional-Differential_Equations_with_Proportional_Delays","222271698_Asymptotic_stability_properties_of_TH-methods_for_the_pantograph_equation","222078370_On_the_th-method_for_delay_differential_equations_with_infinite_lag","220261360_On_the_Attainable_Order_of_Collocation_Methods_for_the_Neutral_Functional-Differential_Equations_with_Proportional_Delays","220179272_Optimal_Superconvergence_Orders_of_Iterated_Collocation_Solutions_for_Volterra_Integral_Equations_with_Vanishing_Delays","31414788_Geometric_meshes_in_collocation_methods_for_Volterra_integral_equations_with_proportional_delays","2829287_Preservation_of_Superconvergence_in_the_Numerical_Integration_of_Delay_Dierential_Equations_With_Proportional_Delay"]}
