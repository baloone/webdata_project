{"id":"248607549_Project-based_learning_in_engineering_higher_education_Two_decades_of_teaching_competences_in_real_environments","abstract":"This paper presents an educational methodology of cooperative project-based learning. This methodology emerges in the final years of the undergraduate programme of the Technical University of Madrid. The paper focuses on the evolution of this experience up to its insertion in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), incorporating the project management competences of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) and broadening its scope to an entire educational strategy for undergraduate and graduate programmes. The results show how the methodology provides three main advantages: (1) it facilitates training in technical, personal, and contextual competences; (2) real problems in the professional sphere are dealt with; and (3) collaborative learning is facilitated through the integration of teaching and research.","authors":["Ignacio De Los Rios","Adolfo Cazorla Montero","José María Díaz-Puente","José Luis Yagüe Blanco"],"meta":["December 2010Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 2(2):1368-1378","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.202"],"references":["228627249_Developing_Knowledge_Landscapes_through_Project-Based_Learning","44825644_Turning_the_contradictions_of_competence_Competency-based_training_and_beyond","39152837_Gestion_de_la_competencia_de_accion_profesional","264259894_Factors_Related_to_Performance_Ratings_of_Engineering_Students_in_Cooperative_Education_Placements","259683129_Cooperative_Education_Work_Assignments_The_Role_of_Organizational_and_Individual_Factors_in_Enhancing_ABET_Competencies_and_Co-op_Workplace_Well-Being","257926245_Bringing_Problem-Based_Learning_to_Higher_Education_Theory_and_Practice","245291422_Certification_and_Accreditation_in_Civil_Engineering","245291302_Using_Community-Based_Projects_in_Civil_Engineering_Capstone_Courses","237930189_Problem-Based_Cooperative_Learning_in_the_Engineering_Classroom","234656535_Social_Skills_and_Cooperative_Education_A_Conceptual_Framework"]}
