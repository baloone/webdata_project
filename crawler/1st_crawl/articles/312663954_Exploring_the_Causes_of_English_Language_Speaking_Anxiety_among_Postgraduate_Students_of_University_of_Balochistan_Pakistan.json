{"id":"312663954_Exploring_the_Causes_of_English_Language_Speaking_Anxiety_among_Postgraduate_Students_of_University_of_Balochistan_Pakistan","abstract":"English language enjoys its glory as an official language of Pakistan and it is used widely as a medium of instructions across educational institutes. Since anxiety retards the learning process, therefore it has been widely researched in the world and seems under researched in Pakistani context. Thus, the prime aim of this research is to explore the factors that cause English language speaking anxiety among Postgraduate Students of University of Balochistan (UoB), Pakistan. This study also aimed at determining the statistical significant difference if any across gender. The quantitative research design was employed in which a questionnaire comprising of eighteen items was adapted from the study by Horwitz et al. (1986). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were performed in the SPSS (version, 21). The findings revealed that UOB students were experiencing anxiety due to myriad factors in EFL classroom. The findings of the t-test revealed no statistical significant difference across gender. This paper has implications on both teaching and learning of English as a foreign language in Pakistani context.","authors":["Nazeer Ahmed","Zahid Hussain Pathan","Faria Saeed Khan"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of English Linguistics 7(2):99","DOI:10.5539/ijel.v7n2p99"],"references":["309722038_Investigating_Foreign_Language_Speaking_Anxiety_within_the_EFL_Learner's_Interlanguage_System_The_Case_of_Iranian_Learners","283316871_Investigating_Foreign_Language_Learning_Anxiety_among_Students_Learning_English_in_A_Public_Sector_University_Pakistan","277196784_Anxiety_over_EFL_speaking_and_writing_A_view_from_language_classrooms","272507492_Anxiety_and_Secondforeign_Language_Learning_Revisited","266492677_An_Investigation_Of_Foreign_Language_Classroom_Anxiety_And_Its_Relationship_With_Students_Achievement","313059651_The_communication_apprehension_perspective_In_J_A_Daly_J_C_McCroskey_EdsAvoiding_communication_Shyness_reticence_and_communication_apprehension","283808631_A_Study_of_High_School_Students'_English_Learning_Anxiety","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","270085758_Language_Anxiety_From_Theory_and_Research_to_Classroom_Implications","263588303_Examination_of_Horwitz_Horwitz_and_Cope's_Construct_of_Foreign_Language_Anxiety_The_Case_of_Students_of_Japanese"]}
