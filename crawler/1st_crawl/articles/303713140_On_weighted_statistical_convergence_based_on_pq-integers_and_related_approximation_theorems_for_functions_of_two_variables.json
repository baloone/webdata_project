{"id":"303713140_On_weighted_statistical_convergence_based_on_pq-integers_and_related_approximation_theorems_for_functions_of_two_variables","abstract":"In this work, we first define a difference operator of natural order m with respect to -integers. We then introduce the concepts of -statistical convergence, statistical -summability and strong -summability of order Î³ by the weighted method. Furthermore, based on the definition of statistical -summability, we prove a Korovkin type approximation theorem for functions of two variables. By using -analogue of Bernstein operator of two variables we give an example which shows that proposed method successfully works. Finally, some Voronovskaja type approximation results are obtained.","authors":["Ugur Kadak"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 443(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2016.05.062"],"references":["299657197_Approximation_by_p_q-Lorentz_Polynomials_on_a_Compact_Disk","292963248_On_a_Kantorovich_Variant_of_pq-Szasz-Mirakjan_Operators","290393589_On_Kantorovich_modification_of_pq-Baskakov_operators","280921340_Some_approximation_results_on_Bernstein-Schurer_operators_defined_by_p_q-integers","279520570_L2-Weighted_statistical_convergence_and_Korovkin_and_Voronovskaya_type_theorems","279450425_On_p_q-analogue_of_Bernstein_operators","277075324_Some_approximation_results_by_pq-analogue_of_Bernstein-Stancu_operators","269915468_On_Certain_Sequence_Spaces","262344991_Korovkin_type_approximation_theorems_proved_via_-statistical_convergence","259476858_Stancu_type_generalization_of_modified_Schurer_operators_based_on_q-_integers","256936979_Some_new_difference_sequence_spaces_of_fractional_order_and_their_dual_spaces","256760740_Lacunary_Statistical_Summability","243013224_Generalized_difference_sequence_spaces_and_their_dual_spaces","225847552_On_certain_q-analogue_of_Szasz_Kantorovich_operators","225590581_Statistical_approximation_properties_of_q-Baskakov-Kantorovich_operators"]}
