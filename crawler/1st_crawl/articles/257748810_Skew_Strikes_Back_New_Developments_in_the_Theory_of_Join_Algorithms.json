{"id":"257748810_Skew_Strikes_Back_New_Developments_in_the_Theory_of_Join_Algorithms","abstract":"Evaluating the relational join is one of the central algorithmic and most\nwell-studied problems in database systems. A staggering number of variants have\nbeen considered including Block-Nested loop join, Hash-Join, Grace, Sort-merge\nfor discussions of more modern issues). Commercial database engines use finely\ntuned join heuristics that take into account a wide variety of factors\nincluding the selectivity of various predicates, memory, IO, etc. In spite of\nthis study of join queries, the textbook description of join processing is\nsuboptimal. This survey describes recent results on join algorithms that have\nprovable worst-case optimality runtime guarantees. We survey recent work and\nprovide a simpler and unified description of these algorithms that we hope is\nuseful for theory-minded readers, algorithm designers, and systems\nimplementors.","authors":["Hung Q.
