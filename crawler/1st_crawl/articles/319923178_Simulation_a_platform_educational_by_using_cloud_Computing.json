{"id":"319923178_Simulation_a_platform_educational_by_using_cloud_Computing","abstract":"Abstract\nCloud Computing is a common word in this present time also led to changed the whole scenario, cloud computing being “on demand” like other “other services”, such as electricity and mobile and etc.., and several educational institutions have been considering and some of them even adopting cloud computing strategies to meet their requirements. Cloud computing services are a growing necessity for educational institutions, In spite of there are still several risks are associated with clouds but its potential benefits outweigh the risks. this paper describes some of the education platforms which used in this education, Then This paper describes the process virtual simulation platform educational use of cloud computing in the Department of Computer Science, which follows the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Kassala- Sudan. With the use of Moodle (LMS) and it has great benefits in facilitating the learning process in the Department of Computer Science when using this Moodle.","authors":["Omer Fadil"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V48P250","Project: Simulation a platform educational by using cloud Computing"],"references":["277295384_Above_the_Clouds_A_Berkeley_View_of_Cloud_Computing","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","265644738_Cloud_computing_and_education_A_state-of-the-art_survey","265038515_Guidelines_on_Security_and_Privacy_in_Public_Cloud_Computing","262354584_The_Web_as_an_application_platform","256033062_The_Cloud_Understanding_the_Security_Privacy_and_Trust_Challenges","254573059_E-Learning_-_A_Guidebook_of_Principles_Procedures_and_Practices","237256092_Delivering_on_the_promise_of_eLearning","220195477_A_Break_in_the_Clouds_Towards_a_Cloud_Definition"]}
