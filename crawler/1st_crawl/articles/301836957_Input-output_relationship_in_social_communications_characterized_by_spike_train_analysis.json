{"id":"301836957_Input-output_relationship_in_social_communications_characterized_by_spike_train_analysis","abstract":"We study the dynamical properties of human communication through different channels, i.e., short messages, phone calls, and emails, adopting techniques from neuronal spike train analysis in order to characterize the temporal fluctuations of successive inter-event times. We first measure the so-called local variation (LV) of incoming and outgoing event sequences of users, and find that these in- and out- LV values are positively correlated for short messages, and uncorrelated for phone calls and emails. Second, we analyze the response-time distribution after receiving a message to focus on the input-output relationship in each of these channels. We find that the time scales and amplitudes of response are different between the three channels. To understand the impacts of the response-time distribution on the correlations between the LV values, we develop a point process model whose activity rate is modulated by incoming and outgoing events. Numerical simulations of the model indicate that a quick response to incoming events and a refractory effect after outgoing events are key factors to reproduce the positive LV correlations. Finally, we also find that the LV value is mostly uncorrelated with conventional centrality measures of nodes in the aggregate network, suggesting that this type of analysis reveals a new dimension of social networks, associated to their temporal properties.","authors":["Takaaki Aoki","Taro Takaguchi","Ryota Kobayashi","Renaud Lambiotte"],"meta":["October 2016PHYSICAL REVIEW E 94(4)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.94.042313"],"references":["287250314_Predicting_links_in_ego-networks_using_temporal_information","280330085_The_Dynamics_of_Information-Driven_Coordination_Phenomena_A_Transfer_Entropy_Analysis","227764176_REVIEW_ARTICLE_Neuronal_coding_and_spiking_randomness","224916007_Universal_features_of_correlated_bursty_behaviour","220026600_Circadian_pattern_and_burstiness_in_mobile_phone_communication","216637282_A_Set_of_Measures_of_Centrality_Based_on_Betweenness","7852402_The_Origins_of_Bursts_and_Heavy_Tails_in_Human_Dynamics","280773148_Modern_temporal_network_theory_A_colloquium","271686371_Spectra_of_Some_Self-Exciting_and_Mutually_Exciting_Point_Processes","248029726_The_Synaptic_Organization_of_the_Brain_an_Introduction","232461220_Communication_Patterns_in_Task-Oriented_Groups","231033081_Burstiness_and_memory_in_complex_systems","220141708_Reality_Mining_Sensing_Complex_Social_Systems","216634004_Social_Network_Analysis_Methods_And_Applications","200451990_The_Synaptic_Organization_of_the_Brai","51992843_Social_Network_Analysis_Methods_and_Applications","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","8081000_A_measure_of_local_variation_of_inter-spike_intervals"]}
