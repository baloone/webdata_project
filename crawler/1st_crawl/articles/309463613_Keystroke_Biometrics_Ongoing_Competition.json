{"id":"309463613_Keystroke_Biometrics_Ongoing_Competition","abstract":"This paper presents the first Keystroke Biometrics Ongoing Competition (KBOC) organized to establish a reproducible baseline in person authentication using keystroke biometrics. The competition has been developed using the BEAT platform and includes one of the largest keystroke databases publicly available based on a fixed text scenario. The database includes genuine and attacker keystroke sequences from 300 users acquired in 4 different sessions distributed in a four month time span. The sequences correspond to the user's name and surname and therefore each user comprises an individual and personal sequence. As baseline for KBOC we report the results of 31 different algorithms evaluated according to performance and robustness. The systems have achieved EERs as low as 5.32% and high robustness against multisession variability with drop of performances lower than 1% for probes separated by months. The entire database is publicly available at the competition website.","authors":["Aythami Morales","Julian Fierrez","Ruben Tolosana","Javier Ortega-Garcia"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Access to appear(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626718"],"references":["346576897_Keystroke_Dynamics_on_Android_Platform","315637470_Development_of_the_Keystroke_Dynamics_Recognition_System","304589462_Robust_Keystroke_Biometric_Anomaly_Detection","294641837_Keystroke_Biometric_Systems_for_User_Authentication","286201083_Shared_research_dataset_to_support_development_of_keystroke_authentication","326668731_Soft_Biometrics_Database_a_Benchmark_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Biometric_Systems","305354457_KBOC_Keystroke_biometrics_OnGoing_competition","302992045_Keystroke_dynamics_on_Android_platform","286812099_Performance_of_keystroke_dynamics_when_allowing_typing_corrections","285334632_Biometric_Authentication_and_Identification_Using_Keystroke_Dynamics_A_Survey"]}
