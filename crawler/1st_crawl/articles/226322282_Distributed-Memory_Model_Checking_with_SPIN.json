{"id":"226322282_Distributed-Memory_Model_Checking_with_SPIN","abstract":"The main limiting factor of the model checker SPIN is currently the amount of available physical memory. This paper explores\nthe possibility of exploiting a distributed-memory execution environment, such as a network of workstations interconnected\nby a standard LAN, to extend the size of the verification problems that can be successfully handled by SPIN. A distributed\nversion of the algorithm used by SPIN to verify safety properties is presented, and its compatibility with the main memory\nand complexity reduction mechanisms of SPIN is discussed. Finally, some preliminary experimental results are presented.","authors":["Flavio Lerda","Riccardo Sisto"],"meta":["August 1999Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1680:22-39","DOI:10.1007/3-540-48234-2_3","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: 6th International SPIN Workshop on Practical Aspects of Model CheckingVolume: 1680"],"references":["228328497_The_Design_and_Validation_of_Computer_Protocols","2668759_State_Compression_in_SPIN_Recursive_Indexing_and_Compression_Training_Runs","2451472_Formal_Methods_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Directions","316517669_Memory_efficient_state_storage_in_SPIN","284470703_ESML_-_A_Validation_Language_for_Concurrent_Systems","3187858_The_Model_Checker_Spin","2930258_Memory_Efficient_State_Storage_in_SPIN","2802025_Mechanized_Formal_Methods_Progress_and_Prospects","2452231_Noncommittal_Barrier_Synchronization"]}
