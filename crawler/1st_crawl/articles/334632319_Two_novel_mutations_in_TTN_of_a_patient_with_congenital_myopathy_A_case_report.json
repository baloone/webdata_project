{"id":"334632319_Two_novel_mutations_in_TTN_of_a_patient_with_congenital_myopathy_A_case_report","abstract":"Background: \nEarly-onset myopathies show a wide spectrum of phenotypes and are composed of various types of inherited neuromuscular diseases, making it difficult to diagnose. TTN mutation-related myopathy is a known cause of early-onset myopathy. Since a next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled sequencing of the vast amount of DNA, TTN, which is the longest coding sequence of any human gene, mutations can now be revealed. We report a 10-year-old female with severe congenital muscular weakness and delayed motor development since birth.\n\nMethods: \nNext-generation sequencing as well as electromyography and muscle biopsy were performed.\n\nResults: \nTo date, she is incapable of walking alone. Her younger sister had similar but more severe symptoms with respiratory failure. In electromyography, short-duration, small-amplitude motor unit action potential, and early recruitment patterns were observed in the involved proximal muscles, suggesting myopathy. Muscle histopathology showed a specific atrophy of increased fiber size variability, frequent nuclear internalization, as well as degeneration and regeneration of fibers with type I fiber predominance, consistent with the findings of a previous report about congenital titinopathy. A NGS study revealed two different possible pathogenic variants in TTN: (a) canonical splicing mutation in the intron 105 (c. 29963-1G>C) and (b) frameshift and truncating mutation in the exon 339 (c.92812dup/p.Arg30938LysfsTer15). All variants were confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing.\n\nConclusion: \nWe propose that unbiased genomic sequencing can be helpful in screening patients with early-onset myopathy.","authors":["Joon Young Jang","Yulhyun Park","Dae-Hyun Jang","Ja-Hyun Jang"],"meta":["July 2019Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine 7(6)","DOI:10.1002/mgg3.866"],"references":["323139303_Interpreting_Genetic_Variants_in_Titin_in_Patients_With_Muscle_Disorders","296469220_Titin_a_Central_Mediator_for_Hypertrophic_Signaling_Exercise-Induced_Mechanosignaling_and_Skeletal_Muscle_Remodeling","273148351_Standards_and_Guidelines_for_the_Interpretation_of_Sequence_Variants_A_Joint_Consensus_Recommendation_of_the_American_College_of_Medical_Genetics_and_Genomics_and_the_Association_for_Molecular_Patholo","324753633_Congenital_Titinopathy_Comprehensive_characterization_and_pathogenic_insights","317826427_A_'second_truncation'_in_TTN_causes_early_onset_recessive_muscular_dystrophy","299650855_Neurologist_Comfort_in_the_Use_of_Next-Generation_Sequencing_Diagnostics","236043272_P157_A_founder_mutation_in_the_titin_gene_is_a_common_cause_of_myofibrillar_myopathy_with_early_respiratory_failure","21667478_Nonvacuolar_myopathy_in_a_large_family_with_both_late_adult_onset_distal_myopathy_and_severe_proximal_muscular_dystrophy","21411067_Muscular_dystrophy_with_separate_phenotypes_in_a_large_family","11638547_The_complete_gene_sequence_of_titin_expression_of_an_unusual_approximately_700-kDa_titin_isoform_and_its_interaction_with_obscurin_identify_a_novel_Z-line_to_I-band_linking_system"]}
