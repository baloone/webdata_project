{"id":"309719165_Fast_construction_of_nets_in_low_dimensional_metrics_and_their_applications","abstract":"We present a near linear time algorithm for constructing hierarchical nets in finite metric spaces with constant doubling dimension. This data-structure is then applied to obtain improved algorithms for the following problems: Approximate nearest neighbor search, well-separated pair decomposition, spanner construction, compact representation scheme, doubling measure, and computation of the (approximate) Lipschitz constant of a function. In all cases, the running (preprocessing) time is near-linear and the space being used is linear.","authors":["Sariel Har-Peled","Manor Mendel"],"meta":["June 2005","Conference: SoCG 2005 The 21st Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry 2005"],"references":[]}
