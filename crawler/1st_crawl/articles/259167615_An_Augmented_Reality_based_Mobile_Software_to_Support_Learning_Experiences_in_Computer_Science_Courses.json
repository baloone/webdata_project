{"id":"259167615_An_Augmented_Reality_based_Mobile_Software_to_Support_Learning_Experiences_in_Computer_Science_Courses","abstract":"Objective of this study is to improve educational processes in abstract or technical courses, by providing a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) tool. This tool is a mobile software system aiming to provide a supportive, e-learning material for students. By using the tool, students can view 3D animations, and special-made videos to have more idea about a course subject, or have a chance to improve their knowledge on the related course content. In order to achieve this, students are enabled to use mobile device camera interface on special signs placed in course books or any other supportive, physical materials that are given by course lecturers. Additionally, it is also possible to watch course materials after focusing on some physical objects in the real-life. Consequently, the software tool has aimed to ensure an effective learning experience by employing advantages of mobile devices and forming interactive sessions between virtual and real environment.","authors":["Utku Köse","Durmus Koc","Süleyman anıl Yücesoy"],"meta":["December 2013Procedia Computer Science 25:370–374","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2013.11.045"],"references":["288429246_Construction_Processes_Using_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_A_Study_Case_in_Building_Engineering_Degree","282441976_An_Experience_on_Natural_Sciences_Augmented_Reality_Contents_for_Preschoolers","279867852_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality_Technologies_Applications_and_Limitations","303174951_Simple_augmented_reality","279903115_A_survey_of_augmented_realty","279677787_Applications_of_Augmented_Reality_Systems_in_Education","262347530_Music_education_using_augmented_reality_with_a_head_mounted_display","262273082_EcoMOBILE_Integrating_augmented_reality_and_probeware_with_environmental_education_field_trips","259552553_A_mixed_methods_assessment_of_students'_flow_experiences_during_a_mobile_augmented_reality_science_game","258813242_3-D_Interactive_Augmented_Reality-enhanced_Digital_Learning_Systems_for_Mobile_Devices"]}
