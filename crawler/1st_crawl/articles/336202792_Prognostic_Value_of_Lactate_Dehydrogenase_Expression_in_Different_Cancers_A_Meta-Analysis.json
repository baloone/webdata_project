{"id":"336202792_Prognostic_Value_of_Lactate_Dehydrogenase_Expression_in_Different_Cancers_A_Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background: \nThis meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the association between the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the prognosis of various malignant neoplasms.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nQualified studies were systematically identified from relevant databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, WanFang, and HowNet. A total of 17 eligible studies with 4,176 patients that complied with the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The 17 articles were published from 2011 to 2018. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained from the selected studies.\n\nResults: \nThe analysis that included all LDH-related studies showed a significant association with the overall survival (OS) outcome (HR = 1.74, P = 0.001) but exhibited an insignificant association with the disease-free survival (DFS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) outcome (HR = 1.40, P = 0.072). High lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression was significantly relevant to inferior OS (HR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.37-2.59) and DFS or RFS (HR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.29-1.89).\n\nConclusions: \nHigh LDH expression and the prognostic outcome of various cancer patients are significantly correlated. High LDHA expression is a promising biomarker for forecasting the survival of patients and the recurrence of different cancers in these patients. Further associative studies are required due to the complex role of LDH genes.","authors":["Jiancheng Lv","Zijian Zhou","Jingzi Wang","Hao Yu"],"meta":["October 2019The American Journal of the Medical Sciences 358(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.amjms.2019.09.012"],"references":["325299465_Prognostic_value_of_D-lactate_dehydrogenase_in_patients_with_clear_cell_renal_cell_carcinoma","315920644_Expression_of_lactate_dehydrogenase_C_correlates_with_poor_prognosis_in_renal_cell_carcinoma","313680410_HIF12a_mediates_hypoxia-induced_LDHA_expression_in_human_pancreatic_cancer_cells","298803237_Pyruvate_Kinase_M2_and_Lactate_Dehydrogenase_A_Are_Overexpressed_in_Pancreatic_Cancer_and_Correlate_with_Poor_Outcome","325887260_LDHA_in_Neuroblastoma_Is_Associated_with_Poor_Outcome_and_Its_Depletion_Decreases_Neuroblastoma_Growth_Independent_of_Aerobic_Glycolysis","325134553_LDHA_upregulation_independently_predicts_poor_survival_in_lung_adenocarcinoma_but_not_in_lung_squamous_cell_carcinoma","319657866_DIP2C_expression_in_breast_cancer_and_its_clinical_significance","318251492_Prognostic_significance_of_lactate_dehydrogenase_B_according_to_histologic_type_of_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_and_its_association_with_serum_lactate_dehydrogenase","316608345_Overexpression_of_lactate_dehydrogenase_A_in_cholangiocarcinoma_is_correlated_with_poor_prognosis","303788144_Novel_prognostic_value_of_nuclear_lactate_dehydrogenase-A_in_esophageal_squamous_cell_carcinoma"]}
