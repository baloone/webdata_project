{"id":"319047875_Which_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methodology_Should_I_Choose_Towards_a_Requirements_Engineering-based_Evaluation_Approach","abstract":"Since many decades, requirements engineering domain has seen significant enhancements towards adapting the security and risk analysis concepts. In this regard, there exist numerous security requirements engineering methodologies that support elicitation and evaluation of the security requirements. However, selecting a security requirements engineering methodology (SRE) for a given context of use often depends on a set of ad hoc criteria. In this paper, we propose a methodological evaluation methodology that helps in identifying the characteristics of a good SRE methodology.","authors":["Sravani Teja Bulusu","Romain Laborde","Ahmad Samer Wazan","François Barrère"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3098954.3098996","Conference: the 12th International Conference"],"references":["314159751_Towards_the_Weaving_of_the_Characteristics_of_Good_Security_Requirements","276832001_Reusable_knowledge_in_security_requirements_engineering_a_systematic_mapping_study","270507919_A_Review_of_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methods_with_Respect_to_Risk_Analysis_and_Model-Driven_Engineering","237745097_How_To_Compare_the_Security_Quality_Requirements_Engineering_SQUARE_Method_with_Other_Methods","221548892_A_Pattern_System_for_Security_Requirements_Engineering","221268669_A_Modeling_Ontology_for_Integrating_Vulnerabilities_into_Security_Requirements_Conceptual_Foundations","298593579_Enterprise_security_architecture_a_business-driven_approach","264821543_A_framework_for_requirements_engineering_method_selection","261338534_Comparing_Privacy_Requirements_Engineering_Approaches","261172457_Engineering_Security_into_Distributed_Systems_A_Survey_of_Methodologies","220631656_Security_quality_requirements_engineering_SQUARE_methodology","220299299_Prioritizing_Requirements","43194410_Security_Requirements_Engineering_for_Evolving_Software_Systems_A_Survey","220693667_Requirements_Engineering_From_System_Goals_to_UML_Models_to_Software_Specifications","220428102_A_Comparison_of_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methods"]}
