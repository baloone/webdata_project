{"id":"275055216_Sub-Riemannian_Mean_Curvature_Flow_for_Image_Processing","abstract":"In this paper we reconsider the sub-Riemannian cortical model of image completion introduced in [G. Citti and A. Sarti, J. Math. Imaging Vision, 24 (2006), pp. 307-326]. This model combines two mechanisms, the sub-Riemannian diffusion and the concentration, giving rise to a diffusion driven motion by curvature. In this paper we give a formal proof of the existence of viscosity solutions of the sub-Riemannian motion by curvature. Furthermore we illustrate the sub-Riemannian finite difference scheme used to implement the model and we discuss some properties of the algorithm. Finally results of completion and enhancement on a number of natural images are shown and compared with other models.","authors":["Giovanna Citti","Benedetta Franceschiello","Gonzalo Sanguinetti","Alessandro Sarti"],"meta":["April 2015SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 9(1)","DOI:10.1137/15M1013572","SourcearXiv","Project: Computational modelling of perceptual phenomena in vision and brain dynamics"],"references":["271507579_Regularity_of_C1_surfaces_with_prescribed_mean_curvature_in_three-dimensional_contact_sub-Riemannian_manifolds","316491167_Image_processing_through_reaction_combined_with_nonlinear_diffusion","315325200_Motion_of_level_sets_by_mean_curvature_I","313060456_User's_guide_to_viscosity_solutions_of_second_order_partial_differential_equations","311533101_Convergence_of_approximation_schemes_for_fully_nonlinear_second_order_equations","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","293601190_Erratum_Invertible_orientation_scores_as_an_application_of_generalized_wavelet_theory_Pattern_Recognition_and_Image_Analysis_2007_17_42","285058764_Receptive_fields_binocular_interaction_and_functional_architecture_in_the_cat's_visual_cortex","271855570_Regularity_of_mean_curvature_flow_of_graphs_on_Lie_groups_free_up_to_step_2","268549422_Linear_and_quasi-linear_equations_of_parabolic_type_Translated_from_the_Russian_by_S_Smith","265894604_Left-invariant_parabolic_evolutions_on_SE2_and_contour_enhancement_via_invertible_orientation_scores_Part_I_Linear_left-invariant_diffusion_equations_on_SE2","253457813_Regular_Hypersurfaces_Intrinsic_Perimeter_and_Implicit_Function_Theorem_in_Carnot_Groups","267009988_An_Introduction_to_the_Heisenberg_Group_and_the_sub-Riemannian_Isoperimetric_Problem","266831853_Minimal_surfaces_in_pseudohermitian_geometry","266046104_Convergence_of_numerical_schemes_for_the_approximation_of_level_set_solutions_to_mean_curvature_flow"]}
