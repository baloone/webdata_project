{"id":"323857023_Local_search_approximation_algorithms_for_the_k-means_problem_with_penalties","abstract":"In this paper, we study the k-means problem with (nonuniform) penalties (k-MPWP) which is a natural generalization of the classic k-means problem. In the k-MPWP, we are given an n-client set \\( {\\mathcal {D}} \\subset {\\mathbb {R}}^d\\), a penalty cost \\(p_j>0\\) for each \\(j \\in {\\mathcal {D}}\\), and an integer \\(k \\le n\\). The goal is to open a center subset \\(F \\subset {\\mathbb {R}}^d\\) with \\( |F| \\le k\\) and to choose a client subset \\(P \\subseteq {\\mathcal {D}} \\) as the penalized client set such that the total cost (including the sum of squares of distance for each client in \\( {\\mathcal {D}} \\backslash P \\) to the nearest open center and the sum of penalty cost for each client in P) is minimized. We offer a local search \\(( 81+ \\varepsilon )\\)-approximation algorithm for the k-MPWP by using single-swap operation. We further improve the above approximation ratio to \\(( 25+ \\varepsilon )\\) by using multi-swap operation.","authors":["Dongmei Zhang","Chunlin Hao","Chenchen Wu","Dachuan Xu"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 37(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-018-0278-6"],"references":["323285358_A_local_search_approximation_algorithm_for_a_squared_metric_k-facility_location_problem","312971435_Local_search_heuristics_for_k-median_and_facility_location_problems","311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","308344396_An_approximation_algorithm_for_k-facility_location_problem_with_linear_penalties_using_local_search_scheme","286513238_On_Variants_of_k-means_Clustering","321066393_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","314295725_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k_-Median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","312970804_Improved_combinatorial_algorithms_for_the_facility_location_and_k-median_problems","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","301706373_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","263048867_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k-median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","280104557_A_bi-criteria_approximation_algorithm_for_k_Means","262392783_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k_-median_problem_extended_abstract","257586125_A_unified_dual-fitting_approximation_algorithm_for_the_facility_location_problems_with_linearsubmodular_penalties"]}
