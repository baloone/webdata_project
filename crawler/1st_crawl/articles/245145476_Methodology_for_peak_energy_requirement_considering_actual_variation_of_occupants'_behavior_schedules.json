{"id":"245145476_Methodology_for_peak_energy_requirement_considering_actual_variation_of_occupants'_behavior_schedules","abstract":"A novel methodology to accurately estimate the cooling demand in residential units is proposed, as a means of providing a better assessment of urban heat-island effects attributable to the use of residential air-conditioning units. The methodology integrates probabilistic variations in occupant behavior, which is shown to be a significant factor in estimated residential cooling requirements. The methodology consists of two key features. The first is an algorithm that generates short-term events that are likely to occur in a residential context, based on published data on occupant behavior. The second is a Monte Carlo approach to cooling load calculations based on stochastic variations in these short-term events and in the consequent likelihood of switching air-conditioning on or off.","authors":["Jun Tanimoto","Aya Hagishima","Hiroki Sagara"],"meta":["April 2008Building and Environment 43(4):610-619","DOI:10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.06.034"],"references":["245196557_Tokyo_weather_data_for_air-conditioning_Outdoor_design_conditions_for_heating_and_cooling_loads_by_the_TAC_method","245196472_An_analysis_of_stochastic_properties_of_the_heating_load_in_an_intermittently_air-conditioned_building","223876579_Modelling_the_heat_dynamics_of_a_building_using_stochastic_differential_equations","223343673_A_stochastic_model_of_user_behaviour_regarding_ventilation","222653231_State_transition_probability_for_the_Markov_Model_dealing_with_onoff_cooling_schedule_in_dwellings"]}
