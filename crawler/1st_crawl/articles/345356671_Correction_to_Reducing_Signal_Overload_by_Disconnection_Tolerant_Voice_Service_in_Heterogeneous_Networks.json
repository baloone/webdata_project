The first sentence of Section III should read “This section proposes an analytical model for DHM, which is based on the mathematical analysis in \n[1] \nand \n[2] \n. Compared to \n[1] \nand \n[2] \n, DHM has different trafc model and different execution condition (DHM only applies in silent period).”","authors":["Chia-Ying Lin","Hui-Ling Chang","Mong-Ting Wu","Yun-Zhan Cai"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access 7:175020-175020","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955619"],"references":["329481423_Reducing_Signal_Overload_by_Disconnection_Tolerant_Voice_Service_in_Heterogeneous_Networks","311705052_Modeling_Delay_Timer_Algorithm_for_Handover_Reduction_in_Heterogeneous_Radio_Access_Networks","260345693_Reducing_Signaling_Overhead_for_FemtocellMacrocell_Networks"]}
