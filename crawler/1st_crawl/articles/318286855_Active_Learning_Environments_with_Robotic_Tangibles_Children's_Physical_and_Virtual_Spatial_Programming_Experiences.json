{"id":"318286855_Active_Learning_Environments_with_Robotic_Tangibles_Children's_Physical_and_Virtual_Spatial_Programming_Experiences","abstract":"Active Learning Environments with Robotic Tangibles (ALERT) and Robopad, an analogous on-screen virtual spatial programming environment for educational Human Robot Interaction (HRI), have been developed. Evaluations of these in the context of free play and open-ended learning activities show that both systems afford opportunities for young children to engage in spatial programming, creating improvisational and sequential programs that mediate interactions between the environment, robots and humans in responsive and creative ways. These systems demonstrate innovative opportunities for advancing mixed reality spatial programming activities as a form of HRI that fosters engaging seamless cyberlearning experiences, across formal and informal environments.","authors":["Winslow Burleson","Danielle Boyd Harlow","Katherine J.
