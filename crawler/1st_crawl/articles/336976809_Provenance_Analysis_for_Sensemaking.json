{"id":"336976809_Provenance_Analysis_for_Sensemaking","abstract":"The articles in this special section examine the concept of \"sensemaking\", which refers to how we structure the unknown so as to be able to act in it. In the context of data analysis it involves understanding the data, generating hypotheses, selecting analysis methods, creating novel solutions, and critical thinking and learning wherever needed. Due to its explorative and creative nature, sensemaking is arguably the most challenging part of any data analysis.","authors":["Jean-Daniel Fekete","T. J.
