{"id":"243963794_On_almost_specification_and_average_shadowing_properties","abstract":"In this paper we study relations between almost specification property,\nasymptotic average shadowing property and average shadowing property for\ndynamical systems on compact metric spaces. We show implications between these\nproperties and relate them to other important notions such as shadowing,\ntransitivity, invariant measures, etc. We provide examples that compactness is\na necessary condition for these implications to hold. As a consequence of our\nmethodology we also obtain a proof that limit shadowing in chain transitive\nsystems implies shadowing.","authors":["Marcin Kulczycki","Dominik Kwietniak","Piotr Oprocha"],"meta":["June 2013Fundamenta Mathematicae 224(3)","DOI:10.4064/fm224-3-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268490775_Properties_of_dynamical_systems_with_the_asymptotic_average_shadowing_property","267144134_On_the_average-shadowing_property","265999457_Shadowing_in_Dynamical_Systems_Theory_and_Applications","265958716_Discreteness_and_continuity_in_problems_of_chaotic_dynamics_Transl_from_the_author_from_an_original_Russian_manuscript","265367298_An_Introduction_to_Ergodic_Theory","257003646_A_note_on_the_average_shadowing_property_for_expansive_maps","253822655_Small_perturbations_of_chaotic_dynamical_systems","251515842_Implications_of_pseudo-orbit_tracing_property_for_continuous_maps_on_compacta","251474104_The_average-shadowing_property_and_strong_ergodicity","243751601_Recurrence_in_Ergodic_Theory_and_Combinatorial_Number_Theory"]}
