{"id":"332568240_The_Effectiveness_of_Inquiry-based_Learning_to_Train_the_Students'_Metacognitive_Skills_Based_on_Gender_Differences","abstract":"In science learning like biology, metacognitive skill needs to be developed. Inquiry-based learning is a learning which may train students' metacognitive skill. This research aimed to: (1) determining the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning in training students' metacognitive skill, and (2) examining the influence of gender difference on the students' metacognitive skills after given the inquiry-based learning. This research used a 4-D research and development model, and one group pre-test and post-test design was applied for the effectiveness trial. The subject of this research was 70 students (35 male and 35 female) of class X Mathematics and Natural Science of Public Senior High School 01 Manokwari, Indonesia. This research employs lesson plan, student worksheet, students' book, expert-validated achievement test and focus group discussion as its instruments. The metacognitive skill data were obtained from metacognitive skill rubric. The data were analyzed using paired sample t-test and independent sample t-test. It was found that inquiry-based learning effectively trains students' metacognitive skill, and there is no significant difference between male students' metacognitive skill with that of female students. Further researches may examine the difference of male and female students' metacognitive skill based on grade, age or personality taught using inquiry-based learning.","authors":["Jan Hendriek Nunaki","Insar Damopolii","Novri youla Kandowangko","Elya Nusantari"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal of Instruction 12(2):505-516","DOI:10.29333/iji.2019.12232a"],"references":["322312151_Education_process_visualization_in_metacognition_development_and_sustainability","282863514_Metacognition_As_Means_to_Increase_the_Effectiveness_of_Inquiry-based_Science_Education","280344941_An_Inquiry-Based_Approach_to_Laboratory_Experiences_Investigating_Students'_Ways_of_Active_Learning","277248695_Learning_Strategies_Explaining_Boys'_and_Girls'_Reading_Performance_in_Schools_with_Different_Language","273772383_Examining_the_effects_of_metacognitive_scaffolding_on_students'_design_problem_solving_in_an_online_environment","272786501_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_INQUIRY-BASED_SCIENCE_EDUCATION_IN_SCIENCE_TEACHER_TRAINING","320355181_Gender_Differences_in_Metacognitive_and_Cognitive_Strategy_Use_and_Reading_Test_Performance","293193229_Meta-Analysis_of_Inquiry-Based_Learning_Effects_of_Guidance","287950142_Design_and_implementation_of_scientific_inquiry_using_technology_in_a_teacher_education_program","281977822_Enhancing_the_Metacognitive_Skill_of_Novice_Programmers_Through_Collaborative_Learning"]}
