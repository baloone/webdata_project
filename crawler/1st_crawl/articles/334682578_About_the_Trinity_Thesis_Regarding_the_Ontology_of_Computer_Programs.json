{"id":"334682578_About_the_Trinity_Thesis_Regarding_the_Ontology_of_Computer_Programs","abstract":"This review of Turner’s “Computational Artifacts” focuses on one of the key novelties of the book, namely the proposal to understand the nature of computer programs as a “trinity” of specification, symbolic program, and physical process, replacing the traditional dualist views of programs as functional/structural or as symbolic/physical. This trinitarian view is found to be robust and helpful to solve typical issues of dualist views. Drawing comparisons with Simon’s view of the artifact as an interface, the author suggests that this trinitarian view may characterize not only computational artifacts but also artifacts in general. One ambiguity is however noticed on the denotation of what Turner actually calls the “physical process.”","authors":["Henri Stephanou"],"meta":["June 2020Philosophy & Technology 33(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13347-019-00368-5"],"references":["326327276_Computational_Artifacts_Towards_a_Philosophy_of_Computer_Science","266847805_Models_of_Discovery_and_Other_Topics_in_the_Methods_of_Science","46513410_Engineering_and_the_dual_nature_of_technical_artefacts","31236088_Three_Myths_of_Computer_Science"]}
