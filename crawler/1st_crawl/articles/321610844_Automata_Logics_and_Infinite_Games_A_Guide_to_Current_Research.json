{"id":"321610844_Automata_Logics_and_Infinite_Games_A_Guide_to_Current_Research","abstract":"A central aim and ever-lasting dream of computer science is to put the development of hardware and software systems on a mathematical basis which is both firm and practical. Such a scientific foundation is needed especially for the construction of reactive programs, like communication protocols or control systems.\nFor the construction and analysis of reactive systems an elegant and powerful theory has been developed based on automata theory, logical systems for the specification of nonterminating behavior, and infinite two-person games.\nThe 19 chapters presented in this multi-author monograph give a consolidated overview of the research results achieved in the theory of automata, logics, and infinite games during the past 10 years. Special emphasis is placed on coherent style, complete coverage of all relevant topics, motivation, examples, justification of constructions, and exercises.","authors":["Erich Graedel","Wolfgang Thomas","Thomas Wilke"],"meta":["January 2002Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-36387-4","ISBN: 978-3-540-00388-5"],"references":[]}
