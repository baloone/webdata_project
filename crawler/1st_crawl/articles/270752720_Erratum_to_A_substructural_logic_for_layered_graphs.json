{"id":"270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","abstract":"Complex systems, be they natural or synthetic, are ubiquitous. In particular, complex networks of devices and services underpin\nmost of society's operations. By their very nature, such systems are difficult to conceptualize and reason about effectively.\nThe concept of layering is widespread in complex systems, but has not been considered conceptually. Noting that graphs are\na key formalism in the description of complex systems, we establish a notion of a layered graph. We provide a logical characterization\nof this notion of layering using a non-associative, non-commutative substructural, separating logic. We provide soundness\nand completeness results for a class of algebraic models that includes layered graphs, which give a mathematically substantial\nsemantics to this very weak logic. We explain, via examples, applications in information processing and security.","authors":["Matthew Collinson","Kevin McDonald","David Pym"],"meta":["July 2014Journal of Logic and Computation 24(4):953-988","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exu002"],"references":["228357749_Semantics_for_structured_systems_modelling_and_simulation","225666320_Display_Logic","220888963_A_degree_centrality_in_multi-layered_social_network","220588732_Modeling_hop-constrained_and_diameter-constrained_minimum_spanning_tree_problems_as_Steiner_tree_problems_over_layered_graphs","220388029_A_Logical_and_Computational_Theory_of_Located_Resource","7069802_Layered_Complex_Networks","293553875_Competitive_algorithms_for_layered_graph_traversal","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","248717516_Deductive_Systems_and_Categories_I","243777300_From_categorial_grammar_to_bilinear_logic","242917619_Sequent-Systems_and_Groupoid_Models_I","242070542_Anytime_Anywhere_Model_Logics_for_Mobile_Ambients","239028647_Relevant_Logic_A_Philosophical_Examination_of_Inference","237109549_Modal_logics_for_mobile_ambients","234803172_Communication_and_Concurrency","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","226345050_What_is_a_categorical_model_of_Intuitionistic_Linear_Logic","225838134_Sequent-systems_and_groupoid_models_II","222670293_Expressiveness_and_complexity_of_graph_logic","222462918_Shortest_Paths_Without_a_Map","222394090_Modeling_and_solving_the_rooted_distance-constrained_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","221942985_Linear_Logic","221498742_Competitive_Algorithms_for_Layered_Graph_Traversal","220897656_A_Spatial_Logic_for_Querying_Graphs","220568189_A_theory_of_decomposition_into_prime_factors_of_layered_interconnection_networks","220430894_Algebraic_Laws_for_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency","220217881_Topological_analysis_of_a_two_coupled_evolving_networks_model_for_business_systems","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","45917460_Classical_BI_Its_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","36239572_Untersuchungen_uber_das_logische_Schliessen","36138485_Natural_Deduction_A_Proof-Theoretical_Study","3811862_On_bunched_predicate_logic","2895661_BI_as_an_Assertion_Language_for_Mutable_Data_Structures","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI","2452873_The_Expression_Of_Graph_Properties_And_Graph_Transformations_In_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic"]}
