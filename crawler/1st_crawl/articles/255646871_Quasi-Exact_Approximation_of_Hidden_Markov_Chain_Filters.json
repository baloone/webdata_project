{"id":"255646871_Quasi-Exact_Approximation_of_Hidden_Markov_Chain_Filters","abstract":"This paper studies the application of exact simulation methods for multi-dimensional multiplicative noise stochastic differential equations to filtering. Stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise naturally occur as Zakai equation in hidden Markov chain filtering. The paper proposes a quasi-exact approximation method for hidden Markov chain filters, which can be applied when discrete time approximations, such as the Euler scheme, may fail in practice.","authors":["Eckhard Platen","Renata Rendek"],"meta":["October 2009SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2172616"],"references":["261367106_Some_Applications_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_to_Optimal_Nonlinear_Filtering","260685488_Numerical_Integration_of_Multiplicative-Noise_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","226307189_Convergence_and_stability_of_implicit_runge-kutta_methods_for_systems_with_multiplicative_noise","23465458_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","302545728_Mean-square_approximation_of_solutions_of_systems_of_stochastic_differential_equations","291069845_T-stability_of_Numerial_Scheme_for_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","268612995_Stochastic_Filtering_Theory","266986786_An_approximation_method_for_a_class_of_Ito_processes_with_jump_component","266455334_Higher_Order_Approximate_Markov_Chain_Filters","265713069_Hidden_Markov_Models_Estimation_and_Control","265423674_A_Theorem_on_the_Order_of_Convergence_of_Mean-Square_Approximations_of_Solutions_of_Systems_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","262160588_Stability_Analysis_of_Numerical_Schemes_for_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","256504631_The_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","250892759_An_Asymptotically_Efficient_Difference_Formula_for_Solving_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","248798873_The_maximum_rate_of_convergence_of_discrete_approximations","242913085_Asymptotically_Efficient_Runge-Kutta_Methods_for_a_Class_of_Ito_and_Stratonovich_Equations","227030258_Higher-order_implicit_strong_numerical_schemes_for_stochastic_differential_equations","226644632_On_the_Optimal_Filtering_of_Diffusion_Processes","225821970_The_maximum_rate_of_convergence_of_discrete_approximations_for_stochastic_differential_equations","43452967_A_note_on_the_Balanced_method","38440678_The_Scaling_and_Squaring_Method_for_the_Matrix_Exponential_Revisited","29673928_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_for_the_Nonlinear_Filtering_Problem","23697085_Strong_Predictor-Corrector_Euler_Methods_for_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","23697015_Applications_of_the_Balanced_Method_to_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_in_Filtering","23548346_On_the_Numerical_Stability_of_Simulation_Methods_for_SDES","2720251_Mean-Square_and_Asymptotic_Stability_of_Numerical_Methods_for_Stochastic_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","2254712_Balanced_Implicit_Methods_For_Stiff_Stochastic_Systems"]}
