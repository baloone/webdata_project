{"id":"304806652_Systematic_and_integrative_analysis_of_large_gene_lists_using_DAVID_bioinformatics_resources","abstract":"DAVID bioinformatics resources consists of an integrated biological knowledgebase and analytic tools aimed at systematically extracting biological meaning from large gene/protein lists. This protocol explains how to use DAVID, a high-throughput and integrated data-mining environment, to analyze gene lists derived from high-throughput genomic experiments. The procedure first requires uploading a gene list containing any number of common gene identifiers followed by analysis using one or more text and pathway-mining tools such as gene functional classification, functional annotation chart or clustering and functional annotation table. By following this protocol, investigators are able to gain an in-depth understanding of the biological themes in lists of genes that are enriched in genome-scale studies.","authors":["Da Wei (David) Huang","Brad T Sherman","Richard A Lempicki"],"meta":["December 2008Nature Protocols 4(1):44-57","DOI:10.1038/nprot.2008.211"],"references":["245840042_DAVID_Database_for_Annotation_Visualization_and_Integrated_Discovery","23305632_DAVID_gene_ID_conversion_tool","11286876_HIV_envelope_induces_a_cascade_of_cell_signals_in_non-proliferating_target_cells_that_favor_virus_replication","10771635_DAVID_Database_for_Annotation_Visualization_and_Integrated_Discovery","9072549_Identifying_Biological_Themes_within_Lists_of_Genes_with_EASE","8682332_Al-Shahrour_F_Diaz-Uriarte_R_Dopazo_J_FatiGO_a_web_tool_for_finding_significant_associations_of_Gene_Ontology_terms_with_groups_of_genes_Bioinformatics_20_578-580","8493682_Onto-Tools_An_ensemble_of_web-accessible_ontology-based_tools_for_the_functional_design_and_interpretation_of_high-throughput_gene_expression_experiments","8151645_GOToolBox_Functional_analysis_of_gene_datasets_based_on_Gene_Ontology","266554422_Gene_set_enrichment_analysis_a_knowledge-based_approach_for_interpreting_genome-wide_expression_profiles_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_U_S_A","8639374_Beissbarth_T_Speed_T_P_GOstat_find_statistically_overrepresented_Gene_Ontologies_within_a_group_of_genes_Bioinformatics_20_1464-1465"]}
