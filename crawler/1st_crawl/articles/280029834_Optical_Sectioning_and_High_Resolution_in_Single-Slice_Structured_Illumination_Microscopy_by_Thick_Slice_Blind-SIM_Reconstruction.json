{"id":"280029834_Optical_Sectioning_and_High_Resolution_in_Single-Slice_Structured_Illumination_Microscopy_by_Thick_Slice_Blind-SIM_Reconstruction","abstract":"The microscope image of a thick fluorescent sample taken at a given focal plane is plagued by out-of-focus fluorescence and diffraction limited resolution. In this work, we show that a single slice of Structured Illumination Microscopy (two or three beam SIM) data can be processed to provide an image exhibiting tight sectioning and high transverse resolution. Our reconstruction algorithm is adapted from the blind-SIM technique which requires very little knowledge of the illumination patterns. It is thus able to deal with illumination distortions induced by the sample or illumination optics. We named this new algorithm thick slice blind-SIM because it models a three-dimensional sample even though only a single two-dimensional plane of focus was measured.","authors":["Aur√©lie Jost","Elen Tolstik","Polina Feldmann","Kai Wicker"],"meta":["July 2015PLoS ONE 10(7):e0132174","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0132174","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260006421_Blind_Deconvolution_of_Widefield_Fluorescence_Microscopic_Data_by_Regularization_of_the_Optical_Transfer_Function_OTF","259252497_Structured_illumination_fluorescence_microscopy_with_distorted_excitations_using_a_filtered_blind-SIM_algorithm","252600532_Laterally_modulated_excitation_microscopy_Improvement_of_resolution_by_using_a_diffraction_grating","241697927_Fluorescent_microscopy_beyond_diffraction_limits_using_speckle_illumination_and_joint_support_recovery","235415675_Phase_optimisation_for_structured_illumination_microscopy","229390539_Blind_deconvolution_of_3D_data_in_wide_field_fluorescence_microscopy","285906939_Numerical_optimization","264991470_High-resolution_fluorescence_imaging_via_pattern-illuminated_Fourier_ptychography","233832700_Structured_illumination_microscopy_using_unknown_speckle_patterns","230873264_Numerical_Optimization_Second_Edition"]}
