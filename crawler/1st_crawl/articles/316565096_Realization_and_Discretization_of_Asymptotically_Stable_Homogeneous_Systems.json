{"id":"316565096_Realization_and_Discretization_of_Asymptotically_Stable_Homogeneous_Systems","abstract":"Sufficient conditions for the existence and convergence to zero of numeric approximations to solutions of asymptotically stable homogeneous systems are obtained for the explicit and implicit Euler integration schemes. It is shown that the explicit Euler method has certain drawbacks for the global approximation of homogeneous systems with non-zero degrees, whereas the implicit Euler scheme ensures convergence of the approximating solutions to zero. Properties of absolute and relative errors of the respective discretizations are investigated.","authors":["Denis Efimov","Andrey Polyakov","Arie Levant","Wilfrid Perruquetti"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2699284"],"references":["313454190_Multivalued_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_Lagrange_Systems_Continuous_and_Discrete-Time_Algorithms","312110728_Stability_and_robustness_of_homogeneous_differential_inclusions","304410813_Robust_Finite-time_Stabilization_and_Observation_of_a_Planar_System_Revisited","286079803_Lyapunov_Stability_and_Performance_Analysis_of_the_Implicit_Discrete_Sliding_Mode_Control","282679200_Globally_Stable_Implicit_Euler_Time-Discretization_of_a_Nonlinear_Single-Input_Sliding-Mode_Control_System","276840985_On_global_inversion_of_homogeneous_maps","271549936_On_fixed_and_finite_time_stability_in_sliding_mode_control","261484098_On_an_extension_of_homogeneity_notion_for_differential_inclusions","260708574_Nonlinear_Feedback_Design_for_Fixed-Time_Stabilization_of_Linear_Control_Systems","243116356_Convergence_to_equilibrium_for_the_backward_Euler_scheme_and_applications","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","220576310_Backward_Euler_discretization_of_fully_nonlinear_parabolic_problems","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","312111890_Discretization_of_asymptotically_stable_homogeneous_systems_by_explicit_and_implicit_euler_methods","294684340_Differential_Equations_with_Discontinuous_Righthand_Sides","287257704_Numerical_Methods_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations_Second_Edition","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","267928734_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_stabilization_Implicit_Lyapunov_function_approach","265343468_Numerical_methods_in_scientific_computing_Vol_1","264235292_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","250677663_On_Stability_in_Control_Systems","224627488_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Quasihomogeneous_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems_with_Application_to_Underactuated_Manipulators","223333921_Implicit_Euler_numerical_scheme_and_chattering-free_implementation_of_sliding_mode_systems","222479166_Homogenous_Lyapunov_function_for_homogenous_continuous_vector_field","200175443_A_special_stability_property_for_linear_multistep_methods","30846679_Geometric_homogeneity_with_application_to_finite-time_stability","4143255_Discrete-time_homogeneous_Lyapunov_functions_for_homogeneous_difference_inclusions"]}
