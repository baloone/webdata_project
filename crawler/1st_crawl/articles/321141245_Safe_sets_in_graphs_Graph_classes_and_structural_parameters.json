{"id":"321141245_Safe_sets_in_graphs_Graph_classes_and_structural_parameters","abstract":"A safe set of a graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is a non-empty subset S of V such that for every component A of G[S] and every component B of \\(G[V {\\setminus } S]\\), we have \\(|A| \\ge |B|\\) whenever there exists an edge of G between A and B. In this paper, we show that a minimum safe set can be found in polynomial time for trees. We then further extend the result and present polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, and also for interval graphs. We also study the parameterized complexity. We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the solution size. Furthermore, we show that this parameter lies between the tree-depth and the vertex cover number. We then conclude the paper by showing hardness for split graphs and planar graphs.","authors":["R. √Ågueda","Nathann Cohen","Shinya Fujita","Sylvain Legay"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 36(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-017-0205-2"],"references":["267157168_Structural_Parameterizations_of_the_Mixed_Chinese_Postman_Problem","321104529_Safe_sets_network_majority_on_weighted_trees","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","309226477_Network_Majority_on_Tree_Topological_Network","306026349_Safe_set_problem_on_graphs","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","267000461_Sparsity_Graphs_Structures_and_Algorithms","265453360_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_III_Tree-decompositions_minors_and_complexity_issues","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","221543071_Graph_Layout_Problems_Parameterized_by_Vertex_Cover","240291874_The_complexity_of_optimal_elimination_trees","222460352_Easy_Problems_for_Tree-Decomposable_Graphs","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms"]}
