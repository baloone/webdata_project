{"id":"319770263_Reasoning_With_Neural_Tensor_Networks_for_Knowledge_Base_Completion","abstract":"A common problem in knowledge representation and related fields is reasoning over a large joint knowledge graph, represented as triples of a relation between two entities. The goal of this paper is to develop a more powerful neural network model suitable for inference over these relationships. Previous models suffer from weak interaction between entities or simple linear projection of the vector space. We address these problems by introducing a neural tensor network (NTN) model which allow the entities and relations to interact multiplicatively. Additionally, we observe that such knowledge base models can be further improved by representing each entity as the average of vectors for the words in the entity name, giving an additional dimension of similarity by which entities can share statistical strength. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a partial knowledge base. Our model outperforms previous models and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet and FreeBase with an accuracy of 86.2% and 90.0%, respectively.","authors":["Richard Socher","Danqi Chen","Christopher D.
