{"id":"289951972_A_Study_on_Fuzzy_Labeling_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper, some new connectivity concepts in fuzzy labeling graphs are defined. The concepts of strong arc, partial cutnode, bridge and block are introduced. A new type of fuzzy labeling graphs called ï¿½-fuzzy labeling graphs is defined. Likewise, this paper generalizes the tree concept in fuzzy labeling graph, which plays a crucial role in many areas of science and technology.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou","Sovan Samanta","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["December 2015Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 30(6)","DOI:10.3233/IFS-152082","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
