{"id":"315860749_We_Used_Neural_Networks_to_Detect_Clickbaits_You_Won't_Believe_What_Happened_Next","abstract":"Online content publishers often use catchy headlines for their articles in order to attract users to their websites. These headlines, popularly known as clickbaits, exploit a userâ€™s curiosity gap and lure them to click on links that often disappoint them. Existing methods for automatically detecting clickbaits rely on heavy feature engineering and domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a neural network architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks for detecting clickbaits. Our model relies on distributed word representations learned from a large unannotated corpora, and character embeddings learned via Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results on a dataset of news headlines show that our model outperforms existing techniques for clickbait detection with an accuracy of 0.98 with F1-score of 0.98 and ROC-AUC of 0.99.","authors":["Ankesh Anand","Tanmoy Chakraborty","Noseong Park"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_46","Conference: European Conference on Information Retrieval"],"references":["310809794_Stop_Clickbait_Detecting_and_preventing_clickbaits_in_online_news_media","309572896_Stop_Clickbait_Detecting_and_Preventing_Clickbaits_in_Online_News_Media","274380525_Learning_Character-level_Representations_for_Part-of-Speech_Tagging","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","265385879_On_the_Properties_of_Neural_Machine_Translation_Encoder-Decoder_Approaches","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","232440476_The_Psychology_of_Curiosity_A_Review_and_Reinterpretation","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","308988773_Clickbait_Detection","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","239058053_Handwritten_digit_recognition_with_a_backpropogation_network","2439558_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_a_Back-Propagation_Network"]}
