{"id":"338934558_QFib_Fast_and_Efficient_Brain_Tractogram_Compression","abstract":"Diffusion MRI fiber tracking datasets can contain millions of 3D streamlines, and their representation can weight tens of gigabytes of memory. These sets of streamlines are called tractograms and are often used for clinical operations or research. Their size makes them difficult to store, visualize, process or exchange over the network. We propose a new compression algorithm well-suited for tractograms, by taking advantage of the way streamlines are obtained with usual tracking algorithms. Our approach is based on unit vector quantization methods combined with a spatial transformation which results in low compression and decompression times, as well as a high compression ratio. For instance, a 11.5GB tractogram can be compressed to a 1.02GB file and decompressed in 11.3 seconds. Moreover, our method allows for the compression and decompression of individual streamlines, reducing the need for a costly out-of-core algorithm with heavy datasets. Last, we open a way toward on-the-fly compression and decompression for handling larger datasets without needing a load of RAM (i.e. in-core handling), faster network exchanges and faster loading times for visualization or processing.","authors":["Corentin Mercier","S.
