{"id":"275974151_Estimation_from_Pairwise_Comparisons_Sharp_Minimax_Bounds_with_Topology_Dependence","abstract":"Data in the form of pairwise comparisons arises in many domains, including\npreference elicitation, sporting competitions, and peer grading among others.\nWe consider parametric ordinal models for such pairwise comparison data\ninvolving a latent vector $w^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ that represents the\n\"qualities\" of the $d$ items being compared; this class of models includes the\ntwo most widely used parametric models--the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and the\nThurstone models. Working within a standard minimax framework, we provide tight\nupper and lower bounds on the optimal error in estimating the quality score\nvector $w^*$ under this class of models. The bounds depend on the topology of\nthe comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared via its\nLaplacian spectrum. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen,\nour results provide principled guidelines for making this choice. Finally, we\ncompare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement models and show\nthat the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal settings have identical\nscalings apart from constant pre-factors.","authors":["Nihar Shah","Sivaraman Balakrishnan","Joseph Bradley","Abhay Parekh"],"meta":["May 2015Journal of Machine Learning Research 17","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262333662_Pairwise_ranking_aggregation_in_a_crowdsourced_setting","251400127_Using_the_Method_of_Pairwise_Comparison_to_Obtain_Reliable_Teacher_Assessments","233932955_Spectra_of_Graphs","233804789_Crowdsourcing_Malaria_Parasite_Quantification_An_Online_Game_for_Analyzing_Images_of_Infected_Thick_Blood_Smears","227390163_Discrete_Choice_Methods_With_Simulation","226779490_The_Modern_Theory_of_Consumer_Behavior_Ordinal_or_Cardinal","222532226_Why_the_magic_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","220320474_Learning_From_Crowds","51651228_Crystal_Structure_of_a_Monomeric_Retroviral_Protease_Solved_by_Protein_Folding_Game_Players","38364236_A_Bound_on_Tail_Probabilities_for_Quadratic_Forms_in_Independent_Random_Variables","24099391_Estimating_Choice_Probabilities_in_Multiattribute_Decision_Making","7941436_A_rank-ordering_method_for_equating_tests_by_expert_judgment","7505647_Absolute_Identification_by_Relative_Judgment","324291966_Individual_Choice_Behavior_A_Theoretical_Analysis","301840770_TrueSkill_A_Bayesian_skill_rating_system","301346961_Inferring_users'_preferences_from_crowdsourced_pairwise_comparisons_A_matrix_completion_approach","284980661_In_search_of_quality_in_crowdsourcing_for_search_engine_evaluation","277821184_How_to_Analyze_Paired_Comparison_Data","277369949_Rank_Analysis_of_Incomplete_Block_Designs","266003736_Introduction_to_Nonparametric_Estimation","265665852_Rank_Analysis_of_Incomplete_Block_Designs_I_The_Method_of_Paired_Comparisons","263352428_Minimax-optimal_Inference_from_Partial_Rankings","260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","260422757_A_Law_of_Comparative_Judgment","254017290_Ranking_Compare_don't_score","251540522_Testing_the_power_of_arguments_in_referendums_A_Bradley-Terry_approach","251134121_Nonparametric_estimators","248515415_The_Analysis_of_Permutations","247736972_Asian_American_Preferences_for_Counselor_Characteristics_Application_of_the_Bradley-Terry-Luce_Model_to_Paired_Comparison_Data","243769318_The_Concentration_of_Measure_Phenomenon","237145794_Hanson-Wright_inequality_and_sub-gaussian_concentration","235008628_Estimate_of_the_number_of_signals_in_error_correcting_codes","233846821_Matrix_estimation_by_Universal_Singular_Value_Thresholding","230801973_Theory_of_Point_Estimation","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","225819180_Luce's_choice_model_and_Thurstone's_categorical_judgment_model_compared_Kornbrot's_data_revisited","223140693_The_depthbreadth_trade-off_in_the_design_of_menu-driven_user_interfaces","223124047_An_application_of_a_biased_version_of_the_Bradley-Terry-Luce_model_to_professional_basketball_results","222118150_An_approach_for_preference_ranking_of_alternatives","221678014_The_Relative_Operating_Characteristic_in_Psychology","221618053_Inferring_Rankings_under_Constrained_Sensing","221397644_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220574872_Explicit_Constructions_of_Linear-Sized_Superconcentrators","51962026_Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons","23171401_reCAPTCHA_Human-based_character_recognition_via_Web_security_measures","15176214_Seven_plus_or_minus_two_A_commentary_on_capacity_limitations","15176212_The_Magical_Number_Seven_Plus_or_Minus_Two_Some_Limits_on_Out_Capacity_for_Processing_Information","5489213_Thurstone_Scaling_as_a_Measurement_Method_to_Quantify_Subjective_Health_Outcomes"]}
