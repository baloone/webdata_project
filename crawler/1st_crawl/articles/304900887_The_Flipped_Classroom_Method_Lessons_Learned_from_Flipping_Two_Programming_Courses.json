{"id":"304900887_The_Flipped_Classroom_Method_Lessons_Learned_from_Flipping_Two_Programming_Courses","abstract":"The flipped classroom teaching method, which emphasizes independent learning of theory and practical, in-depth exercises in the classroom, is gaining foothold in teaching. The method is increasingly being applied at university level. It has been implemented with varying approaches and guidelines, and a single unified process has not been described. In this article we compare existing literature to two case studies where flipped classroom was introduced to teaching. We discuss the lessons learned in these cases and present recommendations based on our experiences. Flipping the classroom has been found to be more efficient than traditional lecture-exercises method and the findings in this study support this. Therefore we recommend teachers to explore the possibility of utilizing the flipped classroom method in their courses.","authors":["Antti Knutas","Antti Herala","Erno Vanhala","Jouni Ikonen"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2983468.2983524","Conference: CompSysTech 2016","Project: LUT Special Interest Group in Education Research and Development"],"references":["301454228_Teaching_programming_with_flipped_classroom_method_a_study_from_two_programming_courses","301454147_Object-oriented_programming_course_revisited","297663593_Structuring_Flipped_Classes_with_Lightweight_Teams_and_Gamification","285935974_The_flipped_classroom_A_survey_of_the_research","283096704_Flipped_Classroom_Strategies_for_CS_Education","273631715_Can_We_Flip_Non-Major_Programming_Courses_Yet","266585956_Inverted_Classroom","344538008_The_Flipped_Classroom_A_Survey_of_the_Research","287010198_Using_Internet_tools_as_an_enhancement_of_C2_teaching_and_learning","283232545_Drop_Fail_Pass_Continue_Persistence_in_CS1_and_Beyond_in_Traditional_and_Inverted_Delivery","262238651_The_inverted-lecture_model_A_case_study_in_computer_architecture","260712268_Comparing_the_Effectiveness_of_an_Inverted_Classroom_to_a_Traditional_Classroom_in_an_Upper-Division_Engineering_Course","265409306_Toward_Solving_the_High_Enrollment_Low_Engagement_Dilemma_A_Case_Study_in_Introductory_Business","262351371_The_inverted_classroom_and_the_CS_curriculum","229509562_Using_Internet_Tools_As_an_Enhancement_of_L2_Cultural_Teaching_and_Learning"]}
