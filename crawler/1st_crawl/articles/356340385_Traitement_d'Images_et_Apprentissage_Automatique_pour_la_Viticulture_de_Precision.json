{"id":"356340385_Traitement_d'Images_et_Apprentissage_Automatique_pour_la_Viticulture_de_Precision","abstract":"An early yield prediction is an essential tool for vinegrowers to prepare for the harvest. In the last decades, many methods have been proposed by researchers to solve this problem practically. In particular, recent computer vision advances allow for fruit counting directly in the field. The objective of this publication is to make an exhaustive review of existing works related to grape detection and yield prediction with computer vision algorithms. This review is focused on approaches using RGB proximal images, including classical image processing algorithms, feature extraction, machine learning models, and deep learning. By recalling works on flower counting, grape detection, berry counting, and yield modelization, we highlight challenges on computer vision research for viticulture applications. In addition, we believe that non-specialists can find this review helpful to understand recent advances in artificial intelligence for precision viticulture.","authors":["Lucas Mohimont","Amine Chemchem","Marine Rondeau","Mathias Roesler"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.5802/roia.9"],"references":["343000961_GBCNet_In-Field_Grape_Berries_Counting_for_Yield_Estimation_by_Dilated_CNNs","342454707_Deep_neural_networks_for_grape_bunch_segmentation_in_natural_images_from_a_consumer-grade_camera","342301455_3DBunch_A_Novel_iOS-Smartphone_Application_to_Evaluate_the_Number_of_Grape_Berries_per_Bunch_Using_Image_Analysis_Techniques","349632523_Prediction_of_Grape_Yields_from_Time-Series_Vegetation_Indices_Using_Satellite_Remote_Sensing_and_a_Machine-Learning_Approach","347687933_Design_of_a_Vineyard_Terrestrial_Robot_for_Multiple_Applications_as_Part_of_the_Innovation_of_Process_and_Product_Preliminary_Results","341662189_Grape_detection_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","340953847_Comparison_of_convolutional_neural_networks_in_fruit_detection_and_counting_A_comprehensive_evaluation","340828426_Counting_of_grapevine_berries_in_images_via_semantic_segmentation_using_convolutional_neural_networks","340715741_A_vision-based_robust_grape_berry_counting_algorithm_for_fast_calibration-free_bunch_weight_estimation_in_the_field","340645891_Vine_disease_detection_in_UAV_multispectral_images_using_optimized_image_registration_and_deep_learning_segmentation_approach","338959386_In-Field_Grape_Cluster_Size_Assessment_for_Vine_Yield_Estimation_Using_a_Mobile_Robot_and_a_Consumer_Level_RGB-D_Camera","335577803_A_Non-Invasive_Method_Based_on_Computer_Vision_for_Grapevine_Cluster_Compactness_Assessment_Using_a_Mobile_Sensing_Platform_under_Field_Conditions","340554532_ROLS_Robust_Object-Level_SLAM_for_Grape_Counting","339145685_Grape_detection_segmentation_and_tracking_using_deep_neural_networks_and_three-dimensional_association","335817656_Automatic_Flower_Number_Evaluation_in_Grapevine_Inflorescences_Using_RGB_Images"]}
