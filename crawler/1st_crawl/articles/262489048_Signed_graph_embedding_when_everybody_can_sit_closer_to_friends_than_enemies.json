{"id":"262489048_Signed_graph_embedding_when_everybody_can_sit_closer_to_friends_than_enemies","abstract":"Signed graphs are graphs with signed edges. They are commonly used to\nrepresent positive and negative relationships in social networks. While balance\ntheory and clusterizable graphs deal with signed graphs to represent social\ninteractions, recent empirical studies have proved that they fail to reflect\nsome current practices in real social networks. In this paper we address the\nissue of drawing signed graphs and capturing such social interactions. We relax\nthe previous assumptions to define a drawing as a model in which every vertex\nhas to be placed closer to its neighbors connected via a positive edge than its\nneighbors connected via a negative edge in the resulting space. Based on this\ndefinition, we address the problem of deciding whether a given signed graph has\na drawing in a given $\\ell$-dimensional Euclidean space. We present forbidden\npatterns for signed graphs that admit the introduced definition of drawing in\nthe Euclidean plane and line. We then focus on the $1$-dimensional case, where\nwe provide a polynomial time algorithm that decides if a given complete signed\ngraph has a drawing, and constructs it when applicable.","authors":["Anne-Marie Kermarrec","Christopher Thraves"],"meta":["May 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255966550_Embedding_signed_graphs_in_the_line","220906703_Spectral_Analysis_of_Signed_Graphs_for_Clustering_Prediction_and_Visualization","51988333_Sitting_Closer_to_Friends_Than_Enemies_Revisited","45275132_Multirelational_Organization_of_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_in_an_Online_World","7524086_Dynamics_of_Social_Balance_on_Networks","280765566_Lex-BFS_and_partition_refinement_with_applications_to_transitive_orientation_interval_graph_recognition_and_consecutive_ones_testing","232477307_Clustering_and_Structural_Balance_in_Graphs","231925641_Counting_balanced_signed_graphs_using_marked_graphs","225145234_On_the_number_of_balanced_signed_graphs","222444911_A_simple_algorithm_to_detect_balance_in_signed_graphs","220976182_Can_Everybody_Sit_Closer_to_Their_Friends_Than_Their_Enemies","220775717_Surfing_a_Web_of_Trust_Reputation_and_Reciprocity_on_CouchSurfingcom","45913067_Governance_in_Social_Media_A_case_study_of_the_Wikipedia_promotion_process","45905816_Predicting_Positive_and_Negative_Links_in_Online_Social_Networks","45905811_Signed_Networks_in_Social_Media","38322649_On_the_Notion_of_Balance_of_a_Signed_Graph","10206079_Structural_balance_A_generalization_of_Heider's_theory","6723731_Summarizing_Dynamic_Bipolar_Conflict_Structures","4004092_Correlation_Clustering"]}
