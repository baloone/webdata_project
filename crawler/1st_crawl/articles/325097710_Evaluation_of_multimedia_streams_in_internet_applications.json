{"id":"325097710_Evaluation_of_multimedia_streams_in_internet_applications","abstract":"With the increasing availability of the Internet, the development of mobile applications for electronic commerce, VoIP, video on demand, collaborative scientific projects, virtual environments and video conferencing, is one of the main targets of the industry. The transport layer provides an end-to-end communication to such applications and plays a major role in providing the Quality of Service. TCP is one of the leading transport protocols, however certain applications those require streaming of audio or video face problems in data sequencing. UDP also observes problem in providing the quality due to its no control over the network congestion. SCTP, a new protocol, combines the services of TCP and UDP with an option to switch between the ordered and unordered delivery. Additionally, the verification of end-to-end connectivity and reliability while delivering the unordered data are the key features of SCTP. This paper presents a comparative analysis of SCTP with TCP and UDP. In order to see the protocol suitability for use in the development of mobile applications, the streams of text, audio and video are used in the simulations. Recently the trends of parallel data transmission have become the attraction of researchers. So, the proposed network for simulation is designed to reflect the multiple paths. In the findings, SCTP showed a better transmission rate in the proposed metrics.","authors":["Imtiaz Ali Halepoto","Adnan Ahmed Arain","Umair Hussain"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1145/3200842.3200848","Conference: the 8th International Conference"],"references":["320126127_SCTP_-_Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol","291775032_Performance_Comparison_of_Transport_Layer_Protocols","250228323_Towards_the_Future_Internet_-_An_Overview_of_Challenges_and_Solutions_in_Research_and_Standardization","224597617_Evaluation_of_Transport_Layer_Protocols_for_Voice_Transmission_in_Various_Network_Scenarios","3282933_Evaluation_of_Transport_Protocols_for_the_Session_Initiation_Protocol","3199142_SCTP_State_of_the_art_in_research_products_and_technical_challenges","2531199_Efiect_of_Congestion_Control_on_the_Performance_of_TCP_and_SCTP_over_Satellite_Networks","288437541_Review_on_current_transport_layer_protocols_for_TCPIP_model","287009623_Performance_evaluation_of_SCTP_and_TCP_in_voice_communication","239975943_Et_al_Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol","239063361_RFC_2960_Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol","234792545_Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol_SCTP_A_Reference_Guide","228783177_SCTP_versus_TCP_Comparing_the_performance_of_transport_protocols_for_web_traffic"]}
