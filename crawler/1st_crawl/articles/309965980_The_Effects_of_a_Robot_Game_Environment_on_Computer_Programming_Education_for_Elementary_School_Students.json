{"id":"309965980_The_Effects_of_a_Robot_Game_Environment_on_Computer_Programming_Education_for_Elementary_School_Students","abstract":"In the past, computer programming was perceived as a task only carried out by computer scientists; in the 21st century, however, computer programming is viewed as a critical and necessary skill that everyone should learn. In order to improve teaching of problem-solving abilities in a computing environment, extensive research is being done on teaching-learning methods, types of teaching software, the educational environment, and related tools. This paper, based on diverse experimental results, proposes an environment where elementary students can easily learn and practice computer programming. The proposed robot game environment used a tangible programming tool with which students can easily create robot programs, without learning syntax, and then validate their programming results; it can also provide various game activities to incite students' interest. Observation of elementary school students placed in the robot game environment confirmed the tool's usability and entertainment aspects, and students' attitudes toward programming and their understanding of programming concepts improved.","authors":["Jaekwoun Shim","Daiyoung Kwon","Wongyu Lee"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Transactions on Education PP(99):1-9","DOI:10.1109/TE.2016.2622227"],"references":["273296803_Practices_of_Teaching_Problem_Solving_Skills_in_Robotics_Education","269704129_Evaluating_children_performance_with_graphical_and_tangible_robot_programming_tools","265731642_Learning_to_communicate_computationally_with_Flip_A_bi-modal_programming_language_for_game_creation","262191161_Case-based_teaching_using_the_Laboratory_Animal_System_for_learning_CC_programming","257719457_Learning_Programming_at_the_Computational_Thinking_Level_via_Digital_Game-Play","257458224_Tangible_versus_graphical_user_interfaces_for_robot_programming_Exploring_cross-age_children's_preferences","228669140_The_use_of_LEGO_Mindstorms_in_elementary_and_secondary_education_game_as_a_way_of_triggering_learning","221516990_Getting_a_grip_on_tangible_interaction_A_framework_on_physical_space_and_social_interaction","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","220140195_Computer_games_created_by_middle_school_girls_Can_they_be_used_to_measure_understanding_of_computer_science_concepts","215439960_Extending_Tangible_Interfaces_for_Education_Digital_Montessori-Inspired_Manipulatives","201381833_Games_Motivation_and_Learning_A_Research_and_Practice_Model","200744690_Games_robots_and_robot_games_Complementary_contexts_for_introductory_computing_education","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","2311166_Tangible_Bits_Towards_Seamless_Interfaces_between_People_Bits_and_Atoms","297719113_Visual_programming_languages_integrated_across_the_curriculum_in_elementary_school_A_two_year_case_study_using_Scratch_in_five_schools","278672713_A_new_way_of_teaching_programming_skills_to_K-12_students_Codeorg","270397847_The_influences_of_a_two-tier_test_strategy_on_student_learning_A_lag_sequential_analysis_approach","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12","262204306_Assessment_frequency_in_introductory_computer_programming_disciplines","260011032_A_game-based_approach_to_the_teaching_of_object-oriented_programming_languages","259852949_Learning_programming_via_worked-examples_Relation_of_learning_styles_to_cognitive_load","259514433_Computational_thinking_and_tinkering_Exploration_of_an_early_childhood_robotics_curriculum","258656545_Algorithmic_Bricks_A_Tangible_Robot_Programming_Tool_for_Elementary_School_Students","257171523_Acceptance_of_game-based_learning_by_secondary_school_teachers","257171462_The_design_and_pilot_evaluation_of_an_interactive_learning_environment_for_introductory_programming_influenced_by_cognitive_load_theory_and_constructivism","257171362_Motivating_the_learning_of_science_topics_in_secondary_school_A_constructivist_edutainment_setting_for_studying_Chaos","254464157_Toward_a_validated_computing_attitudes_survey","250958218_Games_and_Learning_What's_the_Connection","232579732_Problem_Solving","232515976_Negative_Item_Bias_in_Ratings_Scales_for_Preadolescent_Children_A_Cognitive-Developmental_Phenomenon","228675359_Factors_affecting_the_success_of_non-majors_in_learning_to_program","225961689_Looking_At_the_Computer_but_Doing_It_On_Land_Children's_Interactions_in_a_Tangible_Programming_Space","224757893_Work_in_progress-promoting_critical_thinking_while_learning_programming_language_concepts_and_paradigms","220141368_From_turtles_to_Tangible_Programming_Bricks_Explorations_in_physical_language_design","220140248_A_pilot_study_of_cooperative_programming_learning_behavior_and_its_relationship_with_students'_learning_performance","42800135_Do_tangible_interfaces_enhance_learning"]}
