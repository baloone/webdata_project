{"id":"333443843_Deliberative_and_Epistemic_Approaches_to_Democracy","abstract":"Deliberative and epistemic approaches to democracy are two important dimensions of contemporary democratic theory. This chapter studies these dimensions in the emerging ecosystem of civic and political participation tools, and appraises their collective value in a new distinct concept: linked democracy. Linked democracy is the distributed, technology-supported collective decision-making process, where data, information and knowledge are connected and shared by citizens online. Innovation and learning are two key elements of Athenian democracies which can be facilitated by the new digital technologies, and a cross-disciplinary research involving computational scientists and democratic theorists can lead to new theoretical insights of democracy.","authors":["Marta Poblet","Pompeu Casanovas","Víctor Rodríguez-Doncel"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-13363-4_2","In book: Linked Democracy (pp.27-49)","Project: Linked Democracy: Artificial Intelligence for Democratic Innovation"],"references":["321480064_The_Law_of_Deliberative_Democracy_Seeding_the_Field","301273790_Crowd_Wisdom_Relies_on_Agents'_Ability_in_Small_Groups_with_a_Voting_Aggregation_Rule","285355132_A_systemic_approach_to_deliberative_democracy","277941400_A_Genealogy_of_Deliberative_Democracy","277339992_THE_POSSIBILITY_OF_CRITICAL_MINI-PUBLICS_REALPOLITIK_AND_NORMATIVE_CYCLES_IN_DEMOCRATIC_THEORY","270032826_Democracy_and_Its_Critics","258174631_Deliberative_Impacts_The_Macro-Political_Uptake_of_Mini-Publics","254067741_Deliberative_Cultures","249146961_An_Epistemic_Conception_of_Democracy","237269752_Epistemic_democracy_in_classical_Athens_Sophistication_diversity_and_innovation","345889338_Do-It-Yourself_Democracy_The_Rise_of_the_Public_Engagement_Industry","344038488_Democratic_Reason_Politics_Collective_Intelligence_and_the_Rule_of_the_Many","332457379_The_Difference_How_the_Power_of_Diversity_Creates_Better_Groups_Firms_Schools_and_Societies_-_New_Edition","328257627_Discursive_Democracy_Politics_Policy_and_Political_Science","323321992_The_structural_transformation_of_the_public_sphere_an_inquiry_into_a_category_of_bourgeois_society","313561248_The_Idea_of_Public_Reason_Revisited","311295591_Network_Society_and_Future_Scenarios_for_a_Collaborative_Economy","308395718_Deliberative_Mini-Publics_-_Involving_Citizens_in_the_Democratic_Process","305693795_Roundtable_on_Epistemic_Democracy_and_Its_Critics","305553863_Inclusion_and_Democracy","305358635_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Classical_Greece","299882571_Making_Deliberative_Democracy_Practical","299364273_Defining_mini-publics","297164923_Collective_wisdom_Principles_and_mechanisms","292465939_Mini-publics_Issues_and_cases","287780788_Democratic_Reason_Politics_Collective_Intelligence_and_the_Rule_of_the_Many","286163791_Deliberating_in_the_Real_World_Problems_of_Legitimacy_in_Deliberative_Democracy","285941666_Democracy_and_Knowledge_Innovation_and_Learning_in_Classical_Athens","282893462_Cognitive_diversity_binary_decisions_and_epistemic_democracy","277431859_The_Structural_Transformation_of_the_Public_Sphere_An_Inquiry_into_a_Category_of_Bourgeois_Society","276482269_Epistemic_Democracy_and_Its_Challenges","275996871_After_the_Revolution_Authority_in_A_Good_Society","275146663_Does_Diversity_Trump_Ability","272413720_Democratic_Deliberation_in_the_Modern_World_The_Systemic_Turn","266836928_The_drunkard's_walk_How_randomness_rules_our_lives","265077915_Making_Truth_Safe_for_Democracy","264724230_Deliberation_Participation_and_Democratic_Legitimacy_Should_Deliberative_Mini-Publics_Shape_Public_Policy","264695928_Deliberative_Systems_Deliberative_Democracy_at_the_Large_Scale","262057398_Viral_Spiral_How_the_Commoners_Built_a_Digital_Republic_of_Their_Own","261948240_Foundations_and_Frontiers_of_Deliberative_Democracy","261947913_Deliberate_Democracy_and_Beyond_Liberals_Critics_Contestations","255578874_The_Epistemic_Conception_of_Deliberative_Democracy_Defended_Reasons_Rightness_and_Equal_Political_Autonomy","249913407_Introduction_Epistemic_Approaches_to_Democracy","247948930_The_Politics_of_the_Earth_Environmental_Discourses","247207046_Popular_Representation_and_the_Distribution_of_Information","246469979_Information_Aggregation_Rationality_and_the_Condorcet_Jury_Theorem","245584273_Beyond_Fairness_and_Deliberation_The_Epistemic_Dimension_of_Democratic_Authority","240708269_Against_Deliberation","236804836_Epistemic_Value_and_Deliberative_Democracy","231968903_Deliberative_democracy_and_constitutions","229068136_Cognition_in_The_Wild","228003204_Survey_Article_Recipes_for_Public_Spheres_Eight_Institutional_Design_Choices_and_Their_Consequences","227566594_The_Original_Meaning_of_Democracy_Capacity_to_Do_Things_not_Majority_Rule","209410138_The_Rational_Public","202187300_Collective_Intelligence_Mankind's_Emerging_World_in_Cyberspace"]}
