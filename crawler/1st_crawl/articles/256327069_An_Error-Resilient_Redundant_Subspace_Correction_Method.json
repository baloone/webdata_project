{"id":"256327069_An_Error-Resilient_Redundant_Subspace_Correction_Method","abstract":"As we stride toward the exascale era, due to increasing complexity of\nsupercomputers, hard and soft errors are causing more and more problems in\nhigh-performance scientific and engineering computation. In order to improve\nreliability (increase the mean time to failure) of computing systems, a lot of\nefforts have been devoted to developing techniques to forecast, prevent, and\nrecover from errors at different levels, including architecture, application,\nand algorithm. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic error resilient iterative\nlinear solvers and introduce a redundant subspace correction method. Using a\ngeneral framework of redundant subspace corrections, we construct iterative\nmethods, which have the following properties: (1) Maintain convergence when\nerror occurs assuming it is detectable; (2) Introduce low computational\noverhead when no error occurs; (3) Require only small amount of local\n(point-to-point) communication compared to traditional methods and maintain\ngood load balance; (4) Improve the mean time to failure. With the proposed\nmethod, we can improve reliability of many scientific and engineering\napplications. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the new subspace correction method.","authors":["Tao Cui","Jinchao Xu","Chensong Zhang"],"meta":["January 2017Computing and Visualization in Science 18(2-3)","DOI:10.1007/s00791-016-0270-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266490002_High_Performance_Dense_Linear_System_Solver_with_Resilience_to_Multiple_Soft_Errors","266033102_Iterative_solution_of_large_sparse_systems_of_equations_1st_ed","254682671_Architectural_Support_for_Mitigating_DRAM_Soft_Errors_in_Large-Scale_Supercomputers","303419154_Applied_parallel_computing","297509680_An_analysis_of_algorithm-based_fault_tolerance_techniques","282895333_Numerical_Analysis_of_Fixed_Point_Algorithms_in_the_Presence_of_Hardware_Faults","266064216_Domain_decomposition_algorithms_of_Schwarz_type_designed_for_massively_parallel_computers","265424252_Elliptic_differential_equations_theory_and_numerical_treatment_Transl_from_the_German_by_Regine_Fadiman_and_Patrick_D_F_Ion","261152320_Hardware_and_software_co-design_for_robust_and_resilient_execution","255926083_A_parallel_implementation_of_an_iterative_substructuring_algorithm_for_problems_in_three_dimensions"]}
