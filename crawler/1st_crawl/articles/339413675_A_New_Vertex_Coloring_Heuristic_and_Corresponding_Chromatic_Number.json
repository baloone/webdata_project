{"id":"339413675_A_New_Vertex_Coloring_Heuristic_and_Corresponding_Chromatic_Number","abstract":"One method to obtain a proper vertex coloring of graphs using a reasonable number of colors is to start from any arbitrary proper coloring and then repeat some local re-coloring techniques to reduce the number of color classes. The Grundy (First-Fit) coloring and color-dominating colorings of graphs are two well-known such techniques. The color-dominating colorings are also known and commonly referred as b-colorings. But these two topics have been studied separately in graph theory. We introduce a new coloring procedure which combines the strategies of these two techniques and satisfies an additional property. We first prove that the vertices of every graph G can be effectively colored using color classes say \\(C_1, \\ldots , C_k\\) such that (i) for any two colors i and j with \\(1\\le i< j \\le k\\), any vertex of color j is adjacent to a vertex of color i, (ii) there exists a set \\(\\{u_1, \\ldots , u_k\\}\\) of vertices of G such that \\(u_j\\in C_j\\) for any \\(j\\in \\{1, \\ldots , k\\}\\) and \\(u_k\\) is adjacent to \\(u_j\\) for each \\(1\\le j \\le k\\) with \\(j\\not = k\\), and (iii) for each i and j with \\(i\\not = j\\), the vertex \\(u_j\\) has a neighbor in \\(C_i\\). This provides a new vertex coloring heuristic which improves both Grundy and color-dominating colorings. Denote by z(G) the maximum number of colors used in any proper vertex coloring satisfying the above properties. The z(G) quantifies the worst-case behavior of the heuristic. We prove the existence of \\(\\{G_n\\}_{n\\ge 1}\\) such that \\(\\min \\{\\Gamma (G_n), b(G_n)\\} \\rightarrow \\infty \\) but \\(z(G_n)\\le 3\\) for each n. For each positive integer t we construct a family of finitely many colored graphs \\({{\\mathcal {D}}}_t\\) satisfying the property that if \\(z(G)\\ge t\\) for a graph G then G contains an element from \\({{\\mathcal {D}}}_t\\) as a colored subgraph. This provides an algorithmic method for proving numeric upper bounds for z(G).","authors":["Manouchehr Zaker"],"meta":["September 2020Algorithmica 82(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-020-00689-4"],"references":["319957724_The_b-chromatic_number_and_related_topics-A_survey","330661295_Complexity_of_Grundy_coloring_and_its_variants","323378221_Complexity_of_Grundy_coloring_and_its_variants","316519234_Exploring_the_k-colorable_landscape_with_iterated_greedy","312376155_A_characterization_of_b-chromatic_and_partial_Grundy_numbers_by_induced_subgraphs","277333943_A_characterization_of_b-chromatic_and_partial_Grundy_numbers_by_induced_subgraphs","268497582_A_Linear_algorithm_for_the_Grundy_coloring_number_of_a_tree","257428407_On_the_Grundy_and_b-Chromatic_Numbers_of_a_Graph","249725218_The_Grundy_chromatic_number_of_the_complement_of_bipartite_graphs","233882451_The_b-chromatic_number_of_a_graph","229781052_A_survey_on_vertex_coloring_problems","229699907_On-line_and_first-fit_coloring_of_graphs","223399742_Results_on_the_Grundy_chromatic_number_of_graphs","220617190_An_Analysis_of_a_Good_Algorithm_for_the_Subtree_Problem_Corrected","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number"]}
