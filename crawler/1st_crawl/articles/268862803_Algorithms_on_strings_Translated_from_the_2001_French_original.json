{"id":"268862803_Algorithms_on_strings_Translated_from_the_2001_French_original","abstract":"This text and reference on string processes and pattern matching presents examples related to the automatic processing of natural language, to the analysis of molecular sequences and to the management of textual databases. Algorithms are described in a C-like language, with correctness proofs and complexity analysis, to make them ready to implement. The book will be an important resource for students and researchers in theoretical computer science, computational linguistics, computational biology, and software engineering.","authors":["Maxime Crochemore","Christophe Hancart","Thierry Lecroq"],"meta":["DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511546853"],"references":[]}
