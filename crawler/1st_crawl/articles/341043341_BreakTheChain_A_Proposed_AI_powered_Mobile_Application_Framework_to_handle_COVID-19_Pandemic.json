{"id":"341043341_BreakTheChain_A_Proposed_AI_powered_Mobile_Application_Framework_to_handle_COVID-19_Pandemic","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) also referred to as Machine Intelligence is a broad branch of Computer Science. The objective of Artificial Intelligence is to design and create systems which can work intelligently and independently. Artificial Intelligence is a science and engineering in making machines which are built with an ability to solve the problems like human beings with their unnatural intelligence. AI is deeply interconnected with Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These two fields help artificial intelligence systems by providing set of algorithms and neural networks to solve data driven problems.In this digital era, the smart cognitive devices have entered into every domain across the globe and healthcare is no exception.In this paper, we are going to discuss about some of the outstanding mobile applications that are AI enabled in today's care ecosystem. The paper will also discuss on the areas of application in healthcare industry, the benefits of incorporating these technologies. We have also proposed an Artificial Intelligence powered mobile appnamed BreakTheChain which can be effectively used to control the spread of the disease.","authors":["J Vanathi","G Sripradha","Vanathi Sathishkumar"],"meta":["April 2020"],"references":["339661670_Identification_of_COVID-19_Can_be_Quicker_through_Artificial_Intelligence_framework_using_a_Mobile_Phone-Based_Survey_in_the_Populations_when_CitiesTowns_Are_Under_Quarantine","331026237_Evaluation_and_accurate_diagnoses_of_pediatric_diseases_using_artificial_intelligence","327271322_With_an_eye_to_AI_and_autonomous_diagnosis","230611334_Advancing_the_Science_of_mHealth","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","270561476_A_Universal_Truth_No_Health_Without_a_Workforce"]}
