{"id":"341592057_DKP_A_Geographic_Data_and_Knowledge_Platform_for_Supporting_Climate_Service_Design","abstract":"This article falls within the related areas of climate services and geographic information. We present the architecture and features of the Data and Knowledge Platform (DKP), innovative geographic software that was designed as support for climate-service elaboration in the context of change on given geographic areas. It is intended for a community of stakeholders who need visual and geographic tools to design services improving the resilience of society regarding specific local issues. The platform provides different functions for seeking all available geographic information. Anticipating large volumes of data that are to be stored, we opted for a NoSQL database rather than a textual repository. In this paper, we present the different features of the platform and its ability to support visual climate service co-design, and we illustrate our statement with an example.","authors":["Martine Collard","Erick Stattner","Wilfried Segretier","Reynald Eugenie"],"meta":["May 2020International Journal of Geo-Information 9(5):337","DOI:10.3390/ijgi9050337"],"references":["337646095_Need_for_a_common_typology_of_climate_services","335375384_Market_demand_for_climate_services_An_assessment_of_users'_needs","331027351_Toward_a_multi-faceted_conception_of_co-production_of_climate_services","327797007_Handbook_of_Drought_Indicators_and_Indices_Integrated_Drought_Management_Programme_IDMP","317641207_Introducing_design_in_the_development_of_effective_climate_services","310591339_Identifying_research_priorities_to_advance_climate_services","295252060_Towards_a_leading_role_on_climate_services_in_Europe_A_research_and_innovation_roadmap","276356709_Global_integrated_drought_monitoring_and_prediction_system","323496549_Why_popular_support_tools_on_climate_change_adaptation_have_difficulties_in_reaching_local_policy-makers_Qualitative_insights_from_the_UK_and_Germany","312633891_Foundations_of_JSON_Schema"]}
