{"id":"280083135_Computer_Science_at_School_CS_Teacher_Education_-_Koli_Working-group_report_on_CS_at_School","abstract":"In an international study, experts reflected on their national state of computer science education in school, and the associated situation and education of computer science teachers. While these situations are shaped by local circumstances, they are also shaped by changes in the discipline. The results of the study showed a number of recurrent themes and patterns such as curriculum difficulties , training and support for teachers, as well as the understanding (e.g. computer science vs. information technology) and relevance of computer science. The study also draws attention to initiatives that are being undertaken at the local and international levels to solve these problems. Finally, the study points out trends which are – according to the experts asked – likely to occur within the next few years.","authors":["Carsten Schulte","Valentina Dagiene","Anna Eckerdal","Malte Hornung"],"meta":["November 2012","Conference: Koli Calling 2012 conferenceAt: Koli, Finland"],"references":["304674511_Ensuring_Exemplary_Teaching_in_an_Essential_Discipline_Addressing_the_Crisis_in_Computer_Science_Teacher_Certification_-_Final_Report_of_the_CSTA_Teacher_Certification_Task_Force","241623893_CS_Unplugged_and_Middle-School_Students'_Views_Attitudes_and_Intentions_Regarding_CS","234825132_Computer_science_teacher_preparation_is_critical","228951140_Teaching_Programming_in_Secondary_School_A_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Perspective","228466043_Which_Way_with_Informatics_in_High_Schools_in_the_Netherlands_The_Dutch_Dilemma","221437690_Harmonization_of_Informatics_Education_-_Science_Fiction_or_Prospective_Reality","221209648_Pedagogical_content_knowledge_in_programming_education_for_secondary_school","220396216_The_Current_Situation_of_Informatics_Education_in_Mongolia","343364402_Running_on_Empty_the_Failure_to_Teach_K--12_Computer_Science_in_the_Digital_Age","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","279335103_A_Study_in_Contrast_Sources_of_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_for_Secondary_English","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","229122797_The_relationships_between_teachers'_general_beliefs_about_teaching_and_learning_and_their_domain_specific_curricular_beliefs","223889997_Are_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technology_still_masculine_fields_High_school_students'_perceptions_and_career_choices","221536859_CS4HS_an_outreach_program_for_high_school_CS_teachers"]}
