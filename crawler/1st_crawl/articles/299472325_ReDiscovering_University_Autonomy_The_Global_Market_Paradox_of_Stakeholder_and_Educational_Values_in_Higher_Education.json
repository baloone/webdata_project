{"id":"299472325_ReDiscovering_University_Autonomy_The_Global_Market_Paradox_of_Stakeholder_and_Educational_Values_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Governments in all parts of the world are engaged in the radical reform and reshaping of higher education to achieve economic, social, and political objectives. They recognize that they need higher education institutions with greater autonomy and more freedom to help realize their goals; the challenge is to define university autonomy in a way that will best meet the needs of governments, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders. \nTurcan, Reilly, and Bugaian have developed a new and critical understanding of institutional university autonomy by bringing together original case studies based on a holistic view of the topic. The authors evaluate institutional university autonomy by introducing five interfaces that characterize external and internal interactions between modern universities and their key stakeholders. By addressing modern challenges to university autonomy in Europe and beyond in a new and innovative way, (Re)Discovering University Autonomy has far-reaching implications for leaders and managers, researchers, educators, practitioners, and policy makers.","authors":["Romeo V.
