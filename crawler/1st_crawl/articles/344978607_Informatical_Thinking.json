{"id":"344978607_Informatical_Thinking","abstract":"In this paper, we reviewed many definitions of computational thinking, finding they share a lot of common elements, of very different nature. We classified them in mental processes, methods, practices, and transversal skills. Many of these elements seem to be shared with other disciplines and resonate with the current narrative on the importance of 21st-century skills. Our classification helps on shedding light on the misconceptions related to each of the four categories, showing that, not to dilute the concept, elements of computational thinking should be intended inside the discipline of Informatics, being its “disciplinary way of thinking”.","authors":["Michael Lodi"],"meta":["September 2020OLYMPIADS IN INFORMATICS","DOI:10.15388/ioi.2020.09"],"references":["332724947_An_Overview_of_Computational_Thinking","331402669_On_Thinking_and_STEM_Education","327302966_Computational_thinking_-_a_guide_for_teachers","322609141_Computational_Literacy_and_The_Big_Picture_Concerning_Computers_in_Mathematics_Education","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","303943002_A_Framework_for_Computational_Thinking_Based_on_a_Systematic_Research_Review","299450690_Computational_thinking_the_developing_definition","283155060_Defining_Computational_Thinking_for_Mathematics_and_Science_Classrooms","282603860_Computational_thinking_in_compulsory_education_Towards_an_agenda_for_research_and_practice","274309848_Computational_Thinking","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","241623893_CS_Unplugged_and_Middle-School_Students'_Views_Attitudes_and_Intentions_Regarding_CS","234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","220808373_Teaching_CS_unplugged_in_the_high_school_with_limited_success","220808023_Dangers_of_a_Fixed_Mindset_Implications_of_Self-theories_Research_for_Computer_Science_Education_ABSTRACT","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","344978772_Introducing_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Education_Historical_Epistemological_Pedagogical_Cognitive_and_Affective_Aspects","341471539_Polemics_about_Computational_Thinking_Digital_Competence_in_Digital_Zeitgeist_-_Continued_Search_for_Answers","334578392_Does_Studying_CS_Automatically_Foster_a_Growth_Mindset","330720293_Do_we_really_need_computational_thinking","328741233_Computational_Thinking_Relationship_with_Digital_Competence","319133932_Conceptions_and_Misconceptions_about_Computational_Thinking_among_Italian_Primary_School_Teachers","318494427_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_And_Powerful_Ideas","317989665_Computational_Thinking_in_Italian_Schools_Quantitative_Data_and_Teachers'_Sentiment_Analysis_after_Two_Years_of","317158625_Remaining_trouble_spots_with_computational_thinking","316167712_Good_and_Bad_Reasons_to_Teach_All_Students_Computer_Science","314109234_Misconceptions_about_computer_science","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","287391362_Learner-Centered_Design_of_Computing_Education_Research_on_Computing_for_Everyone","247924992_Ubiquity_symposium_Computation_and_Computational_Thinking","242368147_Programming_Languages_as_a_Conceptual_Framework_for_Teaching_Mathematics_Report","228336434_Exploring_signature_pedagogies_Approaches_to_teaching_disciplinary_habits_of_mind","30826117_Analogical_Problem_Solving"]}
