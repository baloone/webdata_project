{"id":"344563940_Function_Design_Optimization_of_Learning_Management_System_LMS_Based_on_Student_Perspective-Case_Study_of_Canvas_Application_University_of_Colorado_Denver","abstract":"As educational concept incorporates the computer science into the management methods, the innovative Learning Management Systems (LMS) have been extensively applied. This research is intended to ascertain the functional requirements derived in the course of LMS development by conducting the quantitative research of Canvas application (one of the representative LMSs) amidst the student users at the University of Colorado Denver. In light of the assessment of rationality and effectiveness towards current Canvas function settings, the findings reveal the predominant using purposes which include the integrated informational function, social networking function and customized learning function; and the study further indicate the practical recommendations in terms of the corresponding demands. The obtained results are supposed to be instrumental for the optimization and upgrade direction of LMS based on the purposes of improving learning motivation, learning efficiency, and learning outcomes.","authors":["Y N Song","Z Q Luan"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1621(1):012058","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1621/1/012058"],"references":["331694881_Utilization_of_Learning_Management_Systems_LMSs_in_higher_education_system_A_case_review_for_Saudi_Arabia","329417127_An_Evaluation_of_The_Mobile_Apps_for_Children_with_Special_Education_Needs_Based_on_The_Utility_Function_Metrics","279190719_Scaling_up_learning_design_impact_of_learning_design_activities_on_LMS_behavior_and_performance_Conference_Item_Scaling_up_learning_design_impact_of_learning_design_activities_on_LMS_behavior_and_perf","277964530_Which_One_or_Another_Comparative_Analysis_of_Selected_LMS","8681398_Asian_American_Multidimensional_Acculturation_Scale_Development_Factor_Analysis_Reliability_and_Validity","243049020_Improved_likelihood_ratio_tests_and_Pearson_chi-squared_tests_for_independence_in_two_dimensional_contingency_tables","236868788_Designing_for_Learning_in_an_Open_World"]}
