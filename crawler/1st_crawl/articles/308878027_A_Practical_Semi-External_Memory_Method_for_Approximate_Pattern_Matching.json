{"id":"308878027_A_Practical_Semi-External_Memory_Method_for_Approximate_Pattern_Matching","abstract":"The approximate pattern matching problem ( ) consists in locating all occurrences of a given pattern P in a text T allowing a specific amount of errors. Due to the character of real applications and the fact that solutions do not have error-free nature in Computer Science, solving is crucial for developing meaningful applications. Recently, Ilie, Navarro and Tinta presented a fast algorithm to solve based on the well-known Landau-Vishkin algorithm. However, the amount of available memory limits the usage of their algorithm, since it requires all the answer array be in memory. In this article, a practical semi-external memory method to solve is presented. The method is based on the direct-comparison variation from Ilie et al.'s algorithm. Performance tests with real data of length up to 1.2 GB showed that the presented method is about 5 times more space-efficient than Ilie et al.'s algorithm and yet, has a competitive trade-off regarding time.","authors":["Daniel Saad Nogueira Nunes","Mauricio Ayala-Rincon"],"meta":["September 2016Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 324","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2016.09.010"],"references":["229067733_Linear_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm","228823728_Modifications_of_the_Landau-Vishkin_Algorithm_Computing_Longest_Common_Extensions_via_Suffix_Arrays_and_Efficient_RMQ_computations","266039967_Bioinformatics_algorithms_Sequence_analysis_genome_rearrangements_and_phylogenetic_reconstruction","244957922_A_linear_space_algorithm_for_com-puting_longest_common_subsequences","234799012_Hirschberg_DS_A_Linear_space_algorithm_for_Computing_Maximal_Common_Subsequences_Commun_ACM_186_341-343","222878384_Fast_Parallel_and_Serial_Approximate_String_Matching","222648617_The_Longest_Common_Extension_Problem_Revisited_and_Applications_to_Approximate_String_Searching","222461643_Algorithms_for_Approximate_String_Matching","222447182_A_Faster_Algorithm_Computing_String_Edit_Distances","221578614_LZ77-Like_Compression_with_Fast_Random_Access","221322760_A_Modification_of_the_Landau-Vishkin_Algorithm_Computing_Longest_Common_Extensions_via_Suffix_Arrays","221313707_Linear-Time_Longest-Common-Prefix_Computation_in_Suffix_Arrays_and_Its_Applications","220980109_The_LCA_problem_revisited","221444095_A_New_Succinct_Representation_of_RMQ-Information_and_Improvements_in_the_Enhanced_Suffix_Array","221313926_Theoretical_and_Practical_Improvements_on_the_RMQ-Problem_with_Applications_to_LCA_and_LCE"]}
