{"id":"332109015_Linear_layout_problems","abstract":"The term layout problem comes from the context of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuit design. Graph layouts are optimization problems where the main objective is to project an original graph into a predefined host graph, usually a horizontal line. In this paper, some of the most relevant linear layout problems are reviewed, where the purpose is to minimize the objective function: the Cutwidth, the Minimum Linear Arrangement, the Vertex Separation, the SumCut, and the Bandwidth. Each problem is presented with its formal definition and it is illustrated with a detailed example. Additionally, the most relevant heuristic methods in the associated literature are reviewed together with the instances used in their evaluation. Since linear layouts represent a challenge for optimization methods in general and, for heuristics in particular, this review pays special attention to the strategies and methodologies which provide high-quality solutions. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.
