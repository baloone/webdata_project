{"id":"337091927_Topologies_on_Zn_that_Are_Not_Homeomorphic_to_the_n-Dimensional_Khalimsky_Topological_Space","abstract":"The present paper deals with two types of topologies on the set of integers, Z : a quasi-discrete topology and a topology satisfying the T 1 2 -separation axiom. Furthermore, for each n âˆˆ N , we develop countably many topologies on Z n which are not homeomorphic to the typical n-dimensional Khalimsky topological space. Based on these different types of new topological structures on Z n , many new mathematical approaches can be done in the fields of pure and applied sciences, such as fixed point theory, rough set theory, and so on.","authors":["Sang-Eon Han","Saeid Jafari","Jeong Min Kang"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7111072"],"references":["336523336_Remarks_on_the_Preservation_of_the_Almost_Fixed_Point_Property_Involving_Several_Types_of_Digitizations","336222187_Remarks_on_fixed_point_assertions_in_digital_topology_3","335980448_The_Fixed_Point_Property_of_Non-Retractable_Topological_Spaces","325841879_Remarks_on_Fixed_Point_Assertions_in_Digital_Topology","323113073_Topological_graphs_based_on_a_new_topology_on_Zn_and_its_applications","330571652_Marcus-Wyse_topological_rough_sets_and_their_applications","329937783_Covering_rough_set_structures_for_a_locally_finite_covering_approximation_space","329131107_Estimation_of_the_complexity_of_a_digital_image_from_the_viewpoint_of_fixed_point_theory","324461217_Digital_Topology","323714575_Semi-Open_Sets_and_Semi-Continuity_in_Topological_Spaces"]}
