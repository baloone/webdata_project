The manufacturer of the PICN material VITA Enamic suggests 3 different finishing procedures for this new material. In the present study, surface roughness and color differences caused from different finishing procedures of VITA Enamic were investigated.\n\nMaterials and methods: \n120 specimens were prepared in dimensions 2 × 10 × 12 mm from VITA Enamic hybrid ceramic blocks with 'high translucency' and 'translucency 2M2' shades. The specimens were divided into 8 groups. For each group, different finishing procedures suggested by the manufacturer were performed. Surface roughness values were determined by a tactile portable profilometer. Color changes were evaluated using a clinical spectrophotometer. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc comparison. The significance level was set at α=0.05.\n\nResults: \nThe roughest surfaces were observed in Glaze Groups. Their surface roughness values were similar to that of the control group. Clinical Kit and Technical Kit groups did not show a statistically significant difference regarding surface roughness (P>.05). The largest color difference regarding ΔE00 was observed in Clinical Kit finishing groups. There were also statistically significant color changes between the groups (P<.05). However, all the groups showed clinically acceptable color change (ΔE00<2.25) except Clinical Kit Groups (ΔE00>2.25).\n\nConclusion: \nWithin the limitations of the present study, it may be suggested that finishing the VITA Enamic restorations by Technical Kit instead of Glaze and Clinical Kit gives better clinical performance in regard to surface roughness and shade matching.","authors":["Mehmet Mustafa Özarslan","Sebnem Buyukkaplan","Çağatay Barutcugil","Merve Özarslan"],"meta":["February 2016The Journal of Advanced Prosthodontics 8(1):16-20","DOI:10.4047/jap.2016.8.1.16","Project: Nurullah TÜRKER"],"references":["281823732_Surface_Roughness_of_Composite_Resins_Subjected_to_Hydrochloric_Acid","268791971_Inlays_Made_From_a_Hybrid_Material_Adaptation_and_Bond_Strengths","235627832_Mechanical_properties_of_polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network_materials_official_publication_of_the_Academy_of_Dental_Materials","280122391_Surface_Evaluation_of_Polishing_Techniques_for_New_Resilient_CADCAM_Restorative_Materials","279515404_Morphology_of_Co-Cr-Mo_dental_alloy_surfaces_polished_by_three_different_mechanical_procedures","279067432_Effect_of_denture_cleansers_on_color_stability_and_surface_roughness_of_denture_base_acrylic_resin","260947478_Characterization_of_polymer-infiltrated_ceramic-network_material","260114544_Hertzian_contact_response_and_damage_tolerance_of_dental_ceramics","258254295_High-temperature-pressure_Polymerized_Resin-infiltrated_Ceramic_Networks","242653113_In-vitro_strength_degradation_of_dental_ceramics_and_novel_PICN_material_by_sharp_indentation"]}
