In some of these situations/problems it is required to represent a set of numerical data by a mathematical curve containing three parameters. Second Degree Parabolic curve, Modified Exponential curve and Logistic curve are such curves containing three parameters. For a set of numerical data, one curve is suitable to represent the data. The suitability of these three curves has been studied, in the current study, in the case of the total population in India. This paper is based on the findings of this study.","authors":["Biswajit Das","Dhritikesh Chakrabarty","Manash Pratim Kashyap"],"meta":["March 2018","Project: Ph.D. Research"],"references":["323511650_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_Modified_Exponential_Curve","322959250_Matrix_Inversion_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322937252_Inversion_of_Matrix_by_Elementary_Transformation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322937169_Backward_Divided_Difference_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322936983_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_Exponential_Curve","322897027_Inversion_of_Matrix_by_Elementary_Column_Transformation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797744_Newton's_Forward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797649_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","308576265_Newton's_Divided_Difference_Interpolation_formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","307867699_Lagrange's_Interpolation_Formula_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_curve","273772771_On_Interpolation_II_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Fundamental_Points_of_Lagrange_and_Hermite_Interpolation","253075077_A_Memoir_on_the_Theory_of_Matrices_Abstract","37408275_Numerical_Methods_in_Finite_Element_Analysis"]}
