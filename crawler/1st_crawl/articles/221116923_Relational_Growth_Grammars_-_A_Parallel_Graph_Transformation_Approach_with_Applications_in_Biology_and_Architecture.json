{"id":"221116923_Relational_Growth_Grammars_-_A_Parallel_Graph_Transformation_Approach_with_Applications_in_Biology_and_Architecture","abstract":"We present the formalism of relational growth grammars. They are a variant of graph grammars with a principal application\nfor plant modelling, where they extend the well-established, but limited formalism of L-systems. The main property is the\napplication of rules in parallel, motivated by the fact that life is fundamentally parallel. A further speciality is the dynamic\ncreation of right-hand sides on rule application. Relational growth grammars have been successfully used not only for plant\nmodelling, but also to model general 3D structures or systems of Artificial Life. We illustrate these applications at several\nexamples, all being implemented using our programming language XL which extends Java and provides an implementation of relational\ngrowth grammars.","authors":["Ole Kniemeyer","GÃ¼nter Barczik","Reinhard Hemmerling","Winfried Kurth"],"meta":["October 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-89020-1_12","SourceDBLP","Conference: Applications of Graph Transformations with Industrial Relevance, Third International Symposium, AGTIVE 2007, Kassel, Germany, October 10-12, 2007, Revised Selected and Invited Papers"],"references":["284879445_Tutorial_introduction_to_graph_transformation_A_software_engineering_perspective","250802789_Groimp_as_a_Platform_for_Functional-Structural_Modelling_of_Plants","239580441_Handbook_of_Graph_Grammars_and_Computing_by_Graph_Transformation","221531118_Representation_of_Genotype_and_Phenotype_in_a_Coherent_Framework_Based_on_Extended_L-Systems","221116985_Local_Specification_of_Surface_Subdivision_Algorithms","221116936_On_Graphs_in_Conceptual_Engineering_Design","221116920_Generation_of_Sierpinski_Triangles_A_Case_Study_for_Graph_Transformation_Tools","220713448_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_-_Part_II_Single_Pushout_Approach_and_Comparison_with_Double_Pushout_Approach","220713239_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","215610329_Fundamentals_of_Algebraic_Graph_Transformation","6852801_Similarities_and_gradients_in_growth_unit_branching_patterns_during_ontogeny_in_'Fuji'_apple_trees_A_stochastic_approach","313860521_Graph-Grammatiken","313755131_Representation_of_genotype_and_phenotype_in_a_coherent_framework_based_on_extended_L-systems","312889854_An_individual_based_model_for_the_study_of_pattern_and_process_in_plant_ecology_an_application_of_object_oriented_programming","312471324_Effect_of_morphological_plasticity_on_leaf_area_distribution_single_tree_and_forest_stand_dynamics","289004209_Canonical_Modelling","275985763_Turtle_Geometry","270356526_The_Value_of_Meristem_States_as_Estimated_by_a_Discrete-Time_Markov_Chain","266518697_Parameterized_L_Systems_for_Modelling_Potential_and_Limitations","265782502_The_algorithmic_beauty_of_plants_With_James_S_Hanan_F_David_Fracchia_Deborah_R_Fowler_Martin_J_M_de_Boer_Lynn_Mercer","265330252_Automata_Languages_Development","262390035_Programmed_graph_replacement_systems","250851989_The_LC_Plant-Modelling_Language","247753191_The_Algorithmic_Beauty_of_Plants-The_Virtual_Laboratory","242492015_On_a_generalization_of_Lindenmayer-systems_to_labelled_graphs","237254541_LIGNUM_A_tree_model_based_on_simple_structural_units","228919495_Rule-based_modelling_with_the_XLGroIMP_software","223930087_Emergent_properties_modelled_with_the_functional_structural_tree_growth_model_ALMIS_Computer_experiments_on_resource_gain_and_use","222680001_MGS_A_Rule-Based_Programming_Language_for_Complex_Objects_and_Collections","221598075_Relational_Growth_Grammars_-_A_Graph_Rewriting_Approach_to_Dynamical_Systems_with_a_Dynamical_Structure","221531387_transsys_A_Generic_Formalism_for_Modelling_Regulatory_Networks_in_Morphogenesis","221117001_Algorithm_and_Tool_for_Ontology_Integration_Based_on_Graph_Rewriting","221116955_The_Modelling_Platform_GroIMP_and_the_Programming_Language_XL","220713325_Graph_rewriting_with_unification_and_composition","220713224_Programmed_Graph_Replacement_Systems","220692783_The_Algrithmic_Beauty_of_Plants","220688762_Graph-Grammatiken_Theorie_Anwendungen_Implementierung","220248994_T0L_Systems_and_Languages","216637965_Mathematical_games_The_fantastic_combinations_of_John_Conway's_new_solitaire_game_life","40103756_Functional-Structural_Plant_Modelling_in_Crop_Production","13689818_A_Multiscale_Model_of_Plant_Topological_Structures","8235786_A_Graph_Grammar_Approach_to_Artificial_Life","7868038_Barley_morphology_genetics_and_hormonal_regulation_of_internode_elongation_modelled_by_a_relational_growth_grammar","6074745_A_Rule-Based_Model_of_Barley_Morphogenesis_with_Special_Respect_to_Shading_and_Gibberellic_Acid_Signal_Transduction"]}
