{"id":"316459315_The_combinatorics_of_LCD_codes_Linear_programming_bound_and_orthogonal_matrices","abstract":"Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes are binary linear codes that meet their dual trivially. We construct LCD codes using orthogonal matrices, self-dual codes, combinatorial designs and Gray map from codes over the family of rings Rk . We give a linear programming bound on the largest size of an LCD code of given length and minimum distance. We make a table of lower bounds for this combinatorial function for modest values of the parameters.","authors":["Steven T.
