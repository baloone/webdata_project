{"id":"249831052_Mixed_Methods_Sampling_A_Typology_With_Examples","abstract":"This article presents a discussion of mixed methods (MM) sampling techniques. MM sampling involves combining well-established qualitative and quantitative techniques in creative ways to answer research questions posed by MM research designs. Several issues germane to MM sampling are presented including the differences between probability and purposive sampling and the probability-mixed-purposive sampling continuum. Four MM sampling prototypes are introduced: basic MM sampling strategies, sequential MM sampling, concurrent MM sampling, and multilevel MM sampling. Examples of each of these techniques are given as illustrations of how researchers actually generate MM samples. Finally, eight guidelines for MM sampling are presented.","authors":["Charles Teddlie","Fen Yu"],"meta":["January 2007Journal of Mixed Methods Research 1(1):77-100","DOI:10.1177/2345678906292430"],"references":["265993978_RESPONSIBILITIES_AND_LEADERSHIP_STYLES_OF_RADIOLOGIC_TECHNOLOGY_PROGRAM_DIRECTORS_IMPLICATIONS_FOR_LEADERSHIP_DEVELOPMENT","255579877_Designing_a_Qualitative_Study","230853009_Teaching_Functions","225083749_Mixed_Methods_Research_A_Research_Paradigm_Whose_Time_Has_Come","11873798_Private_or_NHS_General_Dental_service_care_in_the_UK_A_study_of_public_perceptions_and_experiences","7774643_Deaf_College_Students'_Attitudes_Toward_RacialEthnic_Diversity_Campus_Climate_and_Role_Models","321274607_Mixed_methodology_Combining_qualitative_and_quantitative_approaches","313645416_The_past_and_future_of_mixed_methods_research_from_data_triangulation_to_mixed_model_designs","306153057_Handbook_of_applied_social_research_methods","305389482_Focus_Groups_A_Practical_Guide_for_Applied_Research","292778228_Major_issues_and_controversies","288595893_Collaborative_mixed_methods_research","285817622_Survey_research_Determining_sample_size_and_representative_response","274476389_Qualitative_Researching","273313944_Naturalistic_Inquiry_Sage","272160287_Participant_Observation","259254149_Focus_Groups_A_Practial_Guide_for_Applied_Research","249751906_Methodological_Issues_Related_to_Causal_Studies_of_LeadershipA_Mixed_Methods_Perspective_from_the_USA","242625243_Mixed_Methodology_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Approaches","242569642_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","238712551_Ethnography_and_Qualitative_Design_in_Educational_Research","236144141_The_art_of_Case_Study_Research","235930716_An_Introduction_to_Qualitative_Research_Edition_4","235700625_Advance_Mixed_methods_Research_Designs","234728863_Naturalistic_Inquiry","232603375_Sampling_in_Qualitative_Inquiry","229751539_Perceptions_of_Thriving_by_Women_who_Have_Experienced_Abuse_or_Status-Related_Oppression","225083428_SAGE_Handbook_of_Mixed_Methods_in_Social_and_Behavioral_Research","224952210_A_Review_of_Case_Study_Research_Design_and_Methods","215915768_The_Discovery_Of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_For_Qualitative_Research","215666174_The_Ethnographic_Interview","49553042_An_Introduction_To_Qualitative_Research","44838862_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_An_Expanded_Source_Book","44831842_Qualitative_Research_And_Evaluation_Methods","44828585_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Techniques_And_Procedures_For_Developing_Grounded_Theory","44824089_The_International_Handbook_of_School_Effectiveness_Research","31707896_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_an_Expanded_Sourcebook_MB_Miles_AM_Huberman","13512931_A_Qualitative_Evaluation_of_School-Based_Family_Resource_and_Youth_Service_Centers","12848272_Knowledge_beliefs_and_practices_relevant_for_malaria_control_in_an_endemic_urban_area_of_the_Colombian_Pacific","12600782_Approaches_to_Sampling_and_Case_Selection_in_Qualitative_Research_Examples_in_the_Geography_of_Health"]}
