{"id":"319947524_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_A_Survey_of_Approaches_and_Applications","abstract":"Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is to embed components of a KG including entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, so as to simplify the manipulation while preserving the inherent structure of the KG. It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.","authors":["Quan Wang","Zhendong Mao","Bin Wang","Li Guo"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2017.2754499"],"references":["353962041_Text-Graph_Enhanced_Knowledge_Graph_Representation_Learning","319207032_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_by_Translating_on_Hyperplanes","316985834_Know-Evolve_Deep_Reasoning_in_Temporal_Knowledge_Graphs","316779630_Analogical_Inference_for_Multi-Relational_Embeddings","311990831_Lifted_Rule_Injection_for_Relation_Embeddings","311990270_Encoding_Temporal_Information_for_Time-Aware_Link_Prediction","306093828_TransG_A_Generative_Model_for_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding","306093658_Compositional_Learning_of_Embeddings_for_Relation_Paths_in_Knowledge_Base_and_Text","306093122_Leveraging_Lexical_Resources_for_Learning_Entity_Embeddings_in_Multi-Relational_Data","304316949_STransE_a_novel_embedding_model_of_entities_and_relationships_in_knowledge_bases","301877474_SSP_Semantic_Space_Projection_for_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_with_Text_Descriptions","301404990_Knowledge_Graph_and_Text_Jointly_Embedding","301202126_Probabilistic_Reasoning_via_Deep_Learning_Neural_Association_Models","285507661_Low-Dimensional_Embeddings_of_Logic","282997010_Holographic_Embeddings_of_Knowledge_Graphs","282544263_Fast_rule_mining_in_ontological_knowledge_bases_with_AMIE","282000530_TransA_An_Adaptive_Approach_for_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding","281380823_Injecting_Logical_Background_Knowledge_into_Embeddings_for_Relation_Extraction","318830067_Knowledge_Graph_Representation_with_Jointly_Structural_and_Textual_Encoding","318740441_Chains_of_Reasoning_over_Entities_Relations_and_Text_using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","318738988_On_the_Equivalence_of_Holographic_and_Complex_Embeddings_for_Link_Prediction","313497824_Complex_Embeddings_for_Simple_Link_Prediction","311990145_Jointly_Embedding_Knowledge_Graphs_and_Logical_Rules","311550739_SSE_Semantically_Smooth_Embedding_for_Knowledge_Graphs","311479070_Knowledge_graph_refinement_A_survey_of_approaches_and_evaluation_methods","310748216_Leveraging_knowledge_graphs_for_web-scale_unsupervised_semantic_parsing","308519061_Transition-based_knowledge_graph_embedding_with_relational_mapping_properties","308385764_Distributed_Representation_Learning_for_Knowledge_Graphs_with_Entity_Descriptions","306094021_Knowledge_Base_Completion_via_Coupled_Path_Ranking","305997381_Collaborative_Knowledge_Base_Embedding_for_Recommender_Systems","305341894_A_Translation-Based_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_Preserving_Logical_Property_of_Relations","304964860_Chains_of_Reasoning_over_Entities_Relations_and_Text_using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","303244979_Learning_entity_and_relation_embeddings_for_knowledge_graph_completion","301445971_Context-Dependent_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding","301445872_Efficient_and_Expressive_Knowledge_Base_Completion_Using_Subgraph_Feature_Extraction","301445842_Aligning_Knowledge_and_Text_Embeddings_by_Entity_Descriptions","301404811_Semantically_Smooth_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding","301404516_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_via_Dynamic_Mapping_Matrix","301404449_Entity_Hierarchy_Embedding","299487100_Learning_to_Represent_Knowledge_Graphs_with_Gaussian_Embedding","291295837_Reasoning_with_neural_tensor_networks_for_knowledge_base_completion","288731303_Reducing_the_rank_of_relational_factorization_models_by_including_observable_patterns","288517276_Joint_Semantic_Relevance_Learning_with_Text_Data_and_Graph_Knowledge","288492164_Knowledge_base_completion_via_search-based_question_answering","288250868_A_Review_of_Relational_Machine_Learning_for_Knowledge_Graphs","288060731_Predicting_the_Co-Evolution_of_Event_and_Knowledge_Graphs","285895924_Linguistic_regularities_in_continuous_space_word_representations","284035345_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_by_Locally_Linear_Embedding","282295891_Using_Semantics_and_Statistics_to_Turn_Data_into_Knowledge","282162224_Semantic_parsing_on_freebase_from_question-answer_pairs","280970431_Type-Constrained_Representation_Learning_in_Knowledge_Graphs","281186247_Blending_of_Two_and_Three-way_Interactions_for_Modeling_Multi-relational_Data","280046040_Composing_Relationships_with_Translations","279258225_Translating_Embeddings_for_Modeling_Multi-relational_Data","278801374_A_Tensor-based_Factorization_Model_of_Semantic_Compositionality"]}
