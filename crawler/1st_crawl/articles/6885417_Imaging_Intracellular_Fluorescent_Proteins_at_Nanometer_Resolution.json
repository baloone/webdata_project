{"id":"6885417_Imaging_Intracellular_Fluorescent_Proteins_at_Nanometer_Resolution","abstract":"We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular proteins at nanometer spatial resolution. Numerous sparse subsets\nof photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to ∼2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The\naggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method—termed\nphotoactivated localization microscopy—to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in\nfixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral\nprotein Gag at the plasma membrane.","authors":["Eric Betzig","George H Patterson","Rachid Sougrat","Wolf Lindwasser"],"meta":["October 2006Science 313(5793):1642-5","DOI:10.1126/science.1127344","SourcePubMed"],"references":["45417544_Far-field_fluorescence_microscopy_beyond_the_diffraction_limit","26268924_Superresolution_by_localization_of_quantum_dots_using_blinking_statistics","11780935_Quantitative_Comparison_of_Algorithms_for_Tracking_Single_Fluorescent_Particles","11404249_Multicolor_and_Electron_Microscopic_Imaging_of_Connexin_Trafficking","231631417_A_Dozen_Years_of_Single-Molecule_Spectroscopy_in_Physics_Chemistry_and_Biophysics","38038407_Proposed_Method_for_Molecular_Optical_Imaging","26265567_Excitation_strategies_for_optical_lattice_microscopy","12929307_Use_of_Caged_Fluorophores_to_Track_Macromolecular_Movement_in_Living_Cells","12507845_Surpassing_the_lateral_resolution_limit_by_a_factor_of_two_using_structured_illumination_microscopy_SHORT_COMMUNICATION","11404053_Precise_Nanometer_Localization_Analysis_for_Individual_Fluorescent_Probes"]}
