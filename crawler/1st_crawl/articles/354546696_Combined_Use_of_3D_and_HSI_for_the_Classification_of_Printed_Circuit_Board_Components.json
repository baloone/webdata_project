{"id":"354546696_Combined_Use_of_3D_and_HSI_for_the_Classification_of_Printed_Circuit_Board_Components","abstract":"Successful recycling of electronic waste requires accurate separation of materials such as plastics, PCBs and electronic components on PCBs (capacitors, transistors, etc.). This article therefore proposes a vision approach based on a combination of 3D and HSI data, relying on the mutual support of the datasets to compensate existing weaknesses when using single 3D- and HSI-Sensors. The combined dataset serves as a basis for the extraction of geometric and spectral features. The classification is performed and evaluated based on these extracted features which are exploited through rules. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using real electronic waste and leads to convincing results with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.24%. To illustrate that the addition of 3D data has added value, a comparison is also performed with an SVM classification based only on hyperspectral data.","authors":["Songül Polat","Alain Treméau","Frank Boochs"],"meta":["September 2021Applied Sciences 11(18):8424","DOI:10.3390/app11188424"],"references":["352093380_Knowledge_and_Geo-Object_Based_Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Remote_Sensing_Semantic_Segmentation","351508308_On-line_detection_device_for_high_temperature_forgings_based_on_laser_triangulation","350786719_Object_Semantic_Segmentation_in_Point_Clouds-Comparison_of_a_Deep_Learning_and_a_Knowledge-Based_Method","344355824_Semantic_Segmentation_of_a_Printed_Circuit_Board_for_Component_Recognition_Based_on_Depth_Images","339835261_Automated_Control_of_Surface_Defects_on_Ceramic_Tiles_Using_3D_Image_Analysis","341589987_Object_Detection_Routine_for_Material_Streams_Combining_RGB_and_Hyperspectral_Reflectance_Data_Based_on_Guided_Object_Localization","338496916_Multitask_Deep_Learning_With_Spectral_Knowledge_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","337074619_3D_imaging_methods_in_quality_inspection_systems","336232451_Growing_applications_of_hyperspectral_and_multispectral_imaging","330329604_Advanced_Techniques_for_Hyperspectral_Imaging_in_the_Food_Industry_Principles_and_Recent_Applications","325174711_A_rule-based_approach_for_crop_identification_using_multi-temporal_and_multi-sensor_phenological_metrics","324922242_Detection_of_Red-Meat_Adulteration_by_Deep_Spectral-Spatial_Features_in_Hyperspectral_Images","324426210_Decision-Tree_Rule-Based_and_Random_Forest_Classification_of_High-Resolution_Multispectral_Imagery_for_Wetland_Mapping_and_Inventory","323551117_Modern_Trends_in_Hyperspectral_Image_Analysis_A_Review","330015765_Markerless_Ad-Hoc_Calibration_of_a_Hyperspectral_Camera_and_a_3D_Laser_Scanner_Proceedings_of_the_15th_International_Conference_IAS-15"]}
