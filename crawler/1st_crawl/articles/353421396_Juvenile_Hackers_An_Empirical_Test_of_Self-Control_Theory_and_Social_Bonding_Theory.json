{"id":"353421396_Juvenile_Hackers_An_Empirical_Test_of_Self-Control_Theory_and_Social_Bonding_Theory","abstract":"In accordance with a similar growth in information technology, computer hacking has become a pervasive issue as a form of crime worldwide in recent years. Self-control theory and social bonding theory have frequently been employed to explain various types of crimes, but rarely to explore computer hacking. Drawing from Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) self-control theory and Hirschi’s (1969) social bonding theory, the purpose of this study is to empirically examine the suitability of these two theories in explaining juvenile computer hacking offenses. The self-report survey data utilized for the present study was derived from middle school and high school students in the United States, Russia, Spain, Venezuela, France, Hungary, Germany, and Poland. The current study hypothesizes that hackers’ self-control and social bonding are significant predictors for the commission of computer hacking offenses. The findings of this study provide strong support for Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) self-control theory. In addition, the findings can be interpreted as partially supportive of Hirschi’s (1969) social bonding theory. The authors conclude with a discussion on policy implications.","authors":["Sinchul Back","Sadhika Soor","Jennifer LaPrade"],"meta":["August
