{"id":"339892068_A_Model_for_Developing_Computational_Thinking_Skills","abstract":"Computer science concepts have an important part in other subjects and thinking computationally is being recognized as an important skill for everyone, which leads to the increasing interest in developing computational thinking (CT) as early as at the comprehensive school level. Therefore, research is needed to have a common understanding of CT skills and develop a model to describe the dimensions of CT. Through a systematic literature review, using the EBSCO Discovery Service and the ACM Digital Library search, this paper presents an overview of the dimensions of CT defined in scientific papers. A model for developing CT skills in three stages is proposed: i) defining the problem, ii) solving the problem, and iii) analyzing the solution. Those three stages consist of ten CT skills: problem formulation, abstraction, problem reformulation, decomposition, data collection and analysis, algorithmic design, parallelization and iteration, automation, generalization, and evaluation.","authors":["Tauno Palts","Margus Pedaste"],"meta":["March 2020Informatics in Education 19(1):113-128","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2020.06"],"references":["321816569_Computational_thinking_in_mathematics_education_A_joint_approach_to_encourage_problem-solving_ability","321816044_An_operationalized_model_for_defining_computational_thinking","321356138_Promoting_computational_thinking_and_creativeness_in_primary_school_children","320884563_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_through_Unplugged_Activities_in_Primary_School","320593301_The_Use_of_Computational_Thinking_in_Digital_Fabrication_Projects_-_A_Case_Study_From_the_Cognitive_Perspective","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","321120420_A_Visualization_Tool_to_Support_Analyzing_and_Evaluating_Scratch_Projects","320849061_Computational_thinking_as_an_emergent_learning_trajectory_of_mathematics","319948595_Learning_Computational_Thinking_and_Scratch_at_Distance","319907288_Analysis_of_the_relation_between_computational_thinking_skills_and_various_variables_with_the_structural_equation_model"]}
