{"id":"333792427_Evolutionary_feature_subsets_selection_based_on_interaction_information_for_high_dimensional_imbalanced_data_classification","abstract":"With the advent of technology in various scientific fields, high dimensional data are becoming abundant. A general approach to tackle the resulting challenges is to reduce data dimensionality through feature selection. Traditional feature selection approaches concentrate on selecting relevant features and ignoring irrelevant or redundant ones. However, most of these approaches neglect feature interactions. On the other hand, some datasets have imbalanced classes, which may result in biases towards the majority class. The main goal of this paper is to propose a novel feature selection method based on the interaction information (II) to provide higher level interaction analysis and improve the search procedure in the feature space. In this regard, an evolutionary feature subset selection algorithm based on interaction information is proposed, which consists of three stages. At the first stage, candidate features and candidate feature pairs are identified using traditional feature weighting approaches such as symmetric uncertainty (SU) and bivariate interaction information. In the second phase, candidate feature subsets are formed and evaluated using multivariate interaction information. Finally, the best candidate feature subsets are selected using dominant/dominated relationships. The proposed algorithm is compared with some other feature selection algorithms including mRMR, WJMI, IWFS, IGFS, DCSF, IWFS, K_OFSD, WFLNS, Information Gain and ReliefF in terms of the number of selected features, classification accuracy, F-measure and algorithm stability using three different classifiers, namely KNN, NB, and CART. The results justify the improvement of classification accuracy and the robustness of the proposed method in comparison with the other approaches.","authors":["Elahe Sadat Hosseini","Mohammad Hossein Moattar"],"meta":["June 2019Applied Soft Computing 82:105581","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105581"],"references":["309463544_Comparing_Oversampling_Techniques_to_Handle_the_Class_Imbalance_Problem_A_Customer_Churn_Prediction_Case_Study","281791005_Supervised_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Feature_Selection_A_Review_on_Gene_Selection","281372725_Feature_Selection_Using_Joint_Mutual_Information_Maximisation","260913242_Robust_and_Stable_Feature_Selection_by_Integrating_Ranking_Methods_and_Wrapper_Technique_in_Genetic_Data_Classification","257482053_A_review_of_feature_selection_methods_on_synthetic_data","257436122_A_Review_of_Feature_Selection_Methods_Based_on_Mutual_Information","255006424_A_Powerful_Feature_Selection_approach_based_on_Mutual_Information","248149710_High_Dimensional_Data_Classification","220637892_A_survey_on_feature_extraction_for_pattern_recognition","220284040_Stability_of_feature_selection_algorithms_A_study_on_high-dimensional_spaces","23797889_Normalized_Mutual_Information_Feature_Selection","12938746_Alon_U_Barkai_N_Notterman_DA_Gish_K_Ybarra_S_Mack_D_Levine_AJBroad_patterns_of_gene_expression_revealed_by_clustering_analysis_of_tumor_and_normal_colon_tissues_probed_by_oligonucleotide_arrays_Proc_N","3301850_Using_Mutual_Information_for_Selecting_Features_in_Supervised_Neural_Net_Learning","2458309_Feature_Selection_and_Feature_Extraction_for_Text_Categorization","2417551_Irrelevant_Features_and_the_Subset_Selection_Problem","346692304_Feature_Selection_for_Classification","330386508_Feature_selection_for_imbalanced_data_based_on_neighborhood_rough_sets","326497130_Online_Multi-label_Streaming_Feature_Selection_Based_on_Neighborhood_Rough_Set","325501810_Dynamic_ensemble_selection_for_multi-class_imbalanced_datasets","323567902_Dealing_with_high-dimensional_class-imbalanced_datasets_Embedded_feature_selection_for_SVM_classification","323272588_Class-specific_mutual_information_variation_for_feature_selection","322220123_High-dimensional_hybrid_feature_selection_using_interaction_information-guided_search","319607725_Online_Feature_Selection_for_High-dimensional_Class-imbalanced_Data","318083327_Partitioning_methods_for_pruning_the_Pareto_set_with_application_to_multiobjective_allocation_of_a_cross-trained_workforce","314711329_A_Hybrid_Feature_Selection_Algorithm_Based_on_Large_Neighborhood_Search","312204910_Feature_Selection_by_Maximizing_Independent_Classification_Information","312038248_Gene_selection_using_interaction_information_for_microarray-based_cancer_classification","311246157_Theoretical_Evaluation_of_Feature_Selection_Methods_based_on_Mutual_Information","308871570_A_review_of_feature_selection_methods_with_applications","308851467_A_study_of_feature_selection_approaches_for_classification","302234328_Microarray_Data_Analysis","301446706_WJMI_A_New_Feature_Selection_Algorithm_Based_on_Weighted_Joint_Mutual_Information","294730834_Feature_selection_for_high-dimensional_data","275366850_A_novel_feature_selection_method_considering_feature_interaction","272799572_Feature_Selection_A_literature_Review","271466254_An_improved_feature_selection_algorithm_with_conditional_mutual_information_for_classification_problems","271419187_A_comparison_of_traditional_and_rough_set_approaches_to_missing_attribute_values_in_data_mining","264567246_A_General_Exponential_Framework_for_Dimensionality_Reduction","263509199_A_review_of_microarray_datasets_and_applied_feature_selection_methods","261278344_A_review_of_the_stability_of_feature_selection_techniques_for_bioinformatics_data","259482895_A_survey_on_feature_selection_methods","258790286_A_Survey_on_Different_Feature_Selection_Methods_for_Microarray_Data_Analysis","222453756_Models_of_Incremental_Concept_Formation","221605432_The_Feature_Selection_Problem_Traditional_Methods_and_a_New_Algorithm","220320537_Fast_Binary_Feature_Selection_with_Conditional_Mutual_Information","220172451_Mutual_information-based_feature_selection_for_intrusion_detection_systems","7641976_Feature_Selection_Based_On_Mutual_Information_Criteria_of_Max-DependencyMax-Relevance_and_Min-Redundancy","2749444_Estimating_attributes_Analysis_and_extensions_of_RELIEF","2596911_Feature_Selection_Based_on_Joint_Mutual_Information"]}
