{"id":"338817227_Direct_Force_Feedback_Control_and_Online_Multi-Task_Optimization_for_Aerial_Manipulators","abstract":"In this paper we present an optimization-based method for controlling aerial manipulators in physical contact with the environment. The multi-task control problem, which includes hybrid force-motion tasks, energetic tasks, and position/postural tasks, is recast as a quadratic programming problem with equality and inequality constraints, which is solved online. Thanks to this method, the aerial platform can be exploited at its best to perform the multi-objective tasks, with tunable priorities, while hard constraints such as contact maintenance, friction cones, joint limits, maximum and minimum propeller speeds are all respected. An onboard force/torque sensor mounted at the end effector is used in the feedback loop in order to cope with model inaccuracies and reject external disturbances. Real experiments with a multi-rotor platform and a multi-DoF lightweight manipulator demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in the real world.","authors":["Gabriele Nava","Quentin Sabl√©","Marco Tognon","Daniele Pucci"],"meta":["December 2019IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2019.2958473","Project: Aerial manipulators"],"references":["334044329_6D_interaction_control_with_aerial_robots_The_flying_end-effector_paradigm","330719053_A_Truly-Redundant_Aerial_Manipulator_System_With_Application_to_Push-and-Slide_Inspection_in_Industrial_Plants","329610222_Learning_Robust_Task_Priorities_of_QP-Based_Whole-Body_Torque-Controllers","323857962_Towards_a_Flying_Assistant_Paradigm_the_OTHex","323328890_Aerial_Manipulation_A_Literature_Review","316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","334906829_Port-Hamiltonian_Passivity-Based_Control_on_SE3_of_a_Fully_Actuated_UAV_for_Aerial_Physical_Interaction_Near-Hovering","323404996_Physical-Virtual_Impedance_Control_in_Ultra-Lightweight_and_Compliant_Dual_Arm_Aerial_Manipulators","319449963_Hybrid_motionforce_control_a_review","311754844_Impedance_Control_of_an_aerial-manipulator_Preliminary_results"]}
