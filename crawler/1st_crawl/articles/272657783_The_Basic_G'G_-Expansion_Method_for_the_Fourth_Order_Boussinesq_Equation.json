{"id":"272657783_The_Basic_G'G_-Expansion_Method_for_the_Fourth_Order_Boussinesq_Equation","abstract":"The (G'/G)-expansion method is simple and powerful mathematical tool for constructing traveling wave solutions of nonlinear evolution equations which arise in engineering sciences, mathematical physics and real time application fields. In this article, we have obtained exact traveling wave solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equation, namely, the fourth order Boussinesq equation involving parameters via the (G'/G)-expansion method. In this method, the general solution of the second order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients is implemented. Further, the solitons and periodic solutions are described through three different families. In addition, some of obtained solutions are described in the figures with the aid of commercial software Maple.","authors":["Hasibun Naher"],"meta":["January 2012Applied Mathematics 03(10):1144-1152","DOI:10.4236/am.2012.310168"],"references":["277638894_General_Solution_of_Two_Generalized_Form_of_Burgers_Equation_by_Using_the_G_'_G_-Expansion_Method","271297097_The_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_for_Some_Nonlinear_PDEs_in_Mathematical_Physics","271296739_Some_New_Exact_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_for_the_Generalized_Benney-Luke_GBL_Equation_with_Any_Order","268183882_Soliton_Resonances_of_the_Nonisospectral_Modified_Kadomtsev-Petviashvili_Equation","267856430_New_Explicit_Solutions_of_the_Generalized_2_1-Dimensional_Zakharov-Kuznetsov_Equation","267839699_Exact_Traveling_Wave_Solutions_of_Nonlinear_PDEs_in_Mathematical_Physics","267369673_Jacobi_Elliptic_Function_Solutions_for_2_1_Dimensional_Boussinesq_and_Kadomtsev-Petviashvili_Equation","298185132_Solitary_wave_solutions_and_periodic_cosine_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_wave_equations","268041876_New_exact_traveling_wave_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations","267710632_Expanding_the_Tanh-Function_Method_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations"]}
