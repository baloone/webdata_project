{"id":"260771060_Development_and_validation_of_a_positive_and_negative_affect_scale","abstract":"The aim of this study was to construct a positive and negative affect scale (AS) and to search for validity evidence. The participants were 850 undergraduate students from southern Brazil, 57% female, with a mean age of 21 years (SD=3). A factor analysis extracted two factors: positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). The first one presented an eigenvalue of 5.1 explaining 25.6% of the total variance; the second factor presented an eigenvalue of 2,6 explaining 12.8% of the total variance. The internal consistency for PA was .83, and .77 for NA. High correlations between the two factors of the AS and PANAS were observed: .73 for PA and .74 for NA. It was also observed that PA had positive correlations with life satisfaction, hope, optimism, and self-esteem while NA presented negative correlations with those variables. These results indicate evidences of construct validity and appropriate psychometric properties.","authors":["Cristian Zanon","Micheline Bastianello","Juliana Cerentini Pacico","Claudio S Hutz"],"meta":["August 2013Psico-USF 18(2):193-201","DOI:10.1590/S1413-82712013000200003"],"references":["289964016_Paradigm_shift_to_the_integrative_big_five_trait_taxonomy_History_measurement_and_conceptual_issues","314040128_S","314040049_P","313720078_Society_and_the_adolescent_self-image","303802243_Assessing_self-esteem","303146967_Revisao_da_adaptacao_validacao_e_normatizacao_da_escala_de_autoestima_de_Rosenberg","290777645_Temporal_Stability_and_Cross-Situational_Consistency_of_Affective_Behavioral_and_Cognitive_Responses","289962992_Subjective_well-being","285968217_Distinguishing_Optimism_From_Pessimism_Relations_to_Fundamental_Dimensions_of_Mood_and_Personality","283375700_The_will_and_the_ways_Development_and_validation_of_an_individual-differences_measure_of_hope"]}
