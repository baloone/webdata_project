{"id":"220920142_Authoring_Issues_beyond_Tools","abstract":"Authoring is still considered a bottleneck in successful Interactive Storytelling and Drama. The claim for intuitive authoring\ntools is high, especially for tools that allow storytellers and artists to define dynamic content that can be run with an\nAI-based story engine. We explored two concrete authoring processes in depth, using various Interactive Storytelling prototypes,\nand have provided feedback from the practical steps. The result is a presentation of general issues in authoring Interactive\nStorytelling, rather than of particular problems with a specific system that could be overcome by ‘simply’ designing the right\ninterface. Priorities for future developments are also outlined.","authors":["Ulrike Spierling","Nicolas Szilas"],"meta":["December 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-10643-9_9","SourceDBLP","Conference: Interactive Storytelling, Second Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2009, Guimarães, Portugal, December 9-11, 2009.
