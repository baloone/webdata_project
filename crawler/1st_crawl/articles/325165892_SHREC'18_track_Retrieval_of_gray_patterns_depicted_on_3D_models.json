{"id":"325165892_SHREC'18_track_Retrieval_of_gray_patterns_depicted_on_3D_models","abstract":"This paper presents the results of the SHREC'18 track: Retrieval of gray patterns depicted on 3D models. The task proposed in the contest challenges the possibility of retrieving surfaces with the same texture pattern of a given query model. This task, which can be seen as a simplified version of many real world applications, requires a characterization of the surfaces based on local features, rather then considering the surface size and/or bending. All runs submitted to this track are based on feature vectors. The retrieval performances of the runs submitted for evaluation reveal that texture pattern retrieval is a challenging issue. Indeed, a good balance between the size of the pattern and the dimension of the region around a vertex used to locally analyze the color evolution is crucial for pattern description.","authors":["Elia Moscoso Thompson","Claudio Tortorici","Naoufel Werghi","Stefano Berretti"],"meta":["January 2018","Project: 3D Shape Analysis and recognition on the mesh manifold"],"references":["282931520_Local_binary_patterns_on_triangular_meshes_Concept_and_applications","275947191_Retrieval_of_Non-rigid_textured_Shapes_Using_Low_Quality_3D_Models","261437804_Retrieval_and_Classification_on_Textured_3D_Models","4082577_The_Princeton_Shape_Benchmark","256503388_Active_Co-Analysis_of_a_Set_of_Shapes","222738212_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_with_Classification_Based_on_Feature_Distributions","2345339_Sub-pixel_Distance_Maps_and_Weighted_Distance_Transforms"]}
