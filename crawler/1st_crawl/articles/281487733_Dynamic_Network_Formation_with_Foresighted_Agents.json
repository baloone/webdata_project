{"id":"281487733_Dynamic_Network_Formation_with_Foresighted_Agents","abstract":"What networks can form and persist when agents are self-interested? Can such\nnetworks be efficient? A substantial theoretical literature predicts that the\nonly networks that can form and persist must have very special shapes and that\nsuch networks cannot be efficient, but these predictions are in stark contrast\nto empirical findings. In this paper, we present a new model of network\nformation. In contrast to the existing literature, our model is dynamic (rather\nthan static), we model agents as foresighted (rather than myopic) and we allow\nfor the possibility that agents are heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous). We\nshow that a very wide variety of networks can form and persist; in particular,\nefficient networks can form and persist if they provide every agent a strictly\npositive payoff. For the widely-studied connections model, we provide a full\ncharacterization of the set of efficient networks that can form and persist.\nOur predictions are consistent with empirical findings.","authors":["Yangbo Song","Mihaela van der Schaar"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Game Theory","DOI:10.1007/s00182-020-00714-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266564273_Nestedness_in_networks_A_theoretical_model_and_some_applications","258279081_Dynamic_Network_Formation_with_Incomplete_Information","333019923_Small_Worlds_The_Dynamics_of_Networks_between_Order_and_Randomness","321247877_Collective_dynamics_of_'small-world'_networks","304897701_The_folk_theorem_in_repeated_games_with_discounting_or_with_incomplete_information","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","281230610_A_theory_of_buyer-seller_networks","260265684_Allocating_value_among_farsighted_players_in_network_formation","260138837_Cooperation_with_Network_Monitoring","256059952_Two-Step_Estimation_of_Network-Formation_Models_with_Incomplete_Information"]}
