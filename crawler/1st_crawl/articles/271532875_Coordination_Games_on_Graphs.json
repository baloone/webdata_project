{"id":"271532875_Coordination_Games_on_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce natural strategic games on graphs, which capture the idea of\ncoordination in a local setting. We show that these games have an exact\npotential and have strong equilibria when the graph is a pseudoforest. We also\nexhibit some other classes of graphs for which a strong equilibrium exists.\nHowever, in general strong equilibria do not need to exist. Further, we study\nthe (strong) price of stability and anarchy. Finally, we consider the problems\nof computing strong equilibria and of determining whether a joint strategy is a\nstrong equilibrium.","authors":["Krzysztof R.
