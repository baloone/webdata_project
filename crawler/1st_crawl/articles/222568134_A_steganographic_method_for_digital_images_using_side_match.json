{"id":"222568134_A_steganographic_method_for_digital_images_using_side_match","abstract":"In order to provide larger embedding capacity and to minimize the distortion of the stego-image, a novel steganographic method using side information is presented in this paper. The method exploits the correlation between neighboring pixels to estimate the degree of smoothness or contrast of pixels. If the pixel is located in edge area, then it may tolerate larger changes than those in smooth areas. The two-sided, three-sided, and four-sided side match methods are employed in our scheme. The experimental results show that our method provides a large embedding capacity without making noticeable distortion. Besides, the embedded data can be extracted from the stego-image without referencing the original image.","authors":["Chih-Hsiang Chang","Hsien-Wen Tseng"],"meta":["September 2004Pattern Recognition Letters 25(12):1431-1437","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2004.05.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220354258_Techniques_for_Data_Hiding","2378701_On_The_Limits_of_Steganography","281981615_Information_Hiding_Techniques_for_Steganography_and_Digital_Watermarking","223256802_A_steganographic_method_for_images_by_pixel_value_differncing","220599098_Image_hiding_by_optimal_LSB_substitution_and_genetic_algorithm","5556366_Side_match_and_overlap_match_vector_quantizers_for_images","3835316_Data_hiding_in_images_with_adaptive_numbers_of_least_significant_bits_based_on_the_human_visual_system","3308118_Three-sided_side_match_finite-state_vector_quantization"]}
