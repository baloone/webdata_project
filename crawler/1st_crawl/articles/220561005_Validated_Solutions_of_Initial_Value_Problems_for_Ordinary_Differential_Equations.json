{"id":"220561005_Validated_Solutions_of_Initial_Value_Problems_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","abstract":"Compared to standard numerical methods for initial-value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), validated methods for IVPs for ODEs have two important advantages: if they return a solution to a problem, then (1) the problem is guaranteed to have a unique solution, and (2) an enclosure of the true solution is produced. The authors survey Taylor series methods for validated solutions of IVPs for ODEs, describe several such methods in a common framework, and identify areas for future research.","authors":["Nedialko Nedialkov","Kenneth Ronald Jackson","George Corliss"],"meta":["October 1999Applied Mathematics and Computation 105(1):21-68","DOI:10.1016/S0096-3003(98)10083-8","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2425006_Validating_an_A_Priori_Enclosure_Using_High-Order_Taylor_Series","2322343_Rationale_for_Guaranteed_ODE_Defect_Control","2291776_High-Order_Stiff_ODE_Solvers_via_Automatic_Differentiation_and_Rational_Prediction","268759222_Enclosure_of_solutions_of_ordinary_initial_value_problems_and_applications","268675805_Bounds_for_the_set_of_solutions_of_functional-differential_equations","268668029_On_the_Existence_and_the_Verified_Determination_of_Homoclinic_and_Heteroclinic_Orbits_of_the_Origin_for_the_Lorenz_Equations","266361260_Correct_computation_of_solutions_of_differential_algebraic_control_equations","266301916_Interval_Methods_for_Initial_Value_Problems_in_ODEs","265711496_Solving_ordinary_initial_value_problems_with_guaranteed_bounds","265709263_Computation_of_Guaranteed_Enclosures_for_the_Solutions_of_Ordinary_Initial_and_Boundary_Value_Problems","265370887_Adaptive_Berechnung_von_Integraltransformationen_mit_Fehlerschranken_Adaptive_computation_of_integral_transforms_with_error_bounds","265363328_Computerarithmetic_Scientific_computation_and_programming_languages","264960090_Introduction_to_interval_computations_Transl_from_the_German_by_Jon_Rokne","256391773_Survey_of_interval_algorithms_for_ordinary_differential_equations","252768306_Analysis_of_Error_Control_Strategies_for_Continuous_Runge--Kutta_Methods","248685873_Interval_Arithmetic_Error-Bounding_Algorithms","243774305_The_Solution_of_Initial_Value_Problems_Using_Interval_Arithmetic","242608744_Interval_Methods_for_Systems_of_Equation","240319258_A_new_error-control_for_initial_value_solvers","238758029_The_automatic_analysis_and_control_of_error_in_digital_computation_based_on_the_use_of_interval_numbers","238225620_Einschlieung_der_Llouosung_gewlouohnlicher_Anfangs-und_Randwertaufgaben_und_Anwendungen","234830976_Controlling_the_defect_in_existing_variable-order_Adams_codes_for_initial-value_problems","234800308_Validated_Solution_of_Initial_Value_Problems_for_ODE","230606600_Introduction_to_Interval_Computation","230606107_Automatic_local_coordinate_transformations_to_reduce_the_growth_of_error_bounds_in_interval_computation_of_solutions_of_ordinary_differential_equations","230605921_Enclosing_the_solutions_of_ordinary_initial_and_boundary_value_problems","227966216_Using_Interval_Methods_for_the_Numerical_Solution_of_ODE's","227160627_Algorithms_for_the_inclusion_of_solutions_of_ordinary_initial_value_problems","224682177_A_survey_of_interval_methods_for_differential_equations","222719953_ATOMFT_solving_ODEs_and_DAEs_using_Taylor_series","220791848_How_to_Fight_the_Wrapping_Effect","220690379_Computer_Arithmetic_in_Theory_and_Practice","220260822_On_a_class_of_enclosure_methods_for_initial_value_problems","2306121_Guaranteed_Error_Bounds_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations"]}
