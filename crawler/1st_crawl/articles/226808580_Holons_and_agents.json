{"id":"226808580_Holons_and_agents","abstract":"The future of the manufacturing sector in the world will be determined by how it meets the challenges of the 21st century. Two paradigms promise to meet these challenges, multi-agent systems (MAS) and holonic system (HS). Currently, there is some misunderstanding about the relationships between these two approaches. The aim of this work is to make a study of all the characteristics of the HS and the MAS approach, in order to illustrate a comprehensive comparison of holons and agents, and, at the same time, to present a survey about the main research works in both areas.","authors":["A.
