{"id":"305643462_Comparison_of_performance_of_researchers_recipients_of_CNPq_productivity_grants_in_the_field_of_Brazilian_production_engineering","abstract":"This paper analyses the academic production of researchers that were called “productivity grants” awarded by CNPq, the Brazilian research funding agency, in the field of production engineering in the period 2007–2009. Was extracted the data resumes of 101 Brazilian researchers in the Lattes Platform. In relation to the scientific production, productivity grant researchers presented superior performance than the other professors working in graduate programs in the production engineering area. There is a tendency towards the increase in the mean of supervisions to master students starting from the highest aggregate level of productivity grants going down to the beginner levels. In comparison with the other permanent professors in graduate programs, who do not hold productivity grants, the tutorial mean for both masters and doctorate students of the grant researchers’ is exactly the same as group 2PQ. PQ researchers usually present high scientific production ad low technical production, while DT researchers present low scientific production and high technical production. There seems to be logical coherence regarding the distribution of grants, at least with respect to the easily measurable progression criteria. However, there is some evidence that for criteria that are harder to assess, there may be some discrepancies.","authors":["Claudia Tania Picinin","Luiz Alberto Pilatt","Joao Kovaleski","Alexandre Graeml"],"meta":["July 2016Scientometrics","DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-2070-7"],"references":["299405275_Neurosciences_in_Brazil_a_bibliometric_study_of_main_characteristics_collaboration_and_citations","262541253_Profile_of_medical_researchers_with_scientific_productivity_grants_from_the_Brazilian_National_Research_Council_CNPq","262518979_CNPq_researchers_in_medicine_A_comparative_study_of_research_areas","262433853_Profile_of_the_Conselho_Nacional_de_Desenvolvimento_Cientifico_e_Tecnologico_CNPq_productivity_fellows_in_the_area_of_Veterinary_Medicine","257662855_Brazilian_scientific_production_in_science_education","250988715_Perfil_dos_pesquisadores_da_Saude_Coletiva_no_Conselho_Nacional_de_Desenvolvimento_Cientifico_e_Tecnologico","244751320_Produtividade_em_pesquisa_do_CNPq_analise_do_perfil_dos_pesquisadores_da_Quimica","236001262_Profile_and_scientific_output_analysis_of_physical_therapy_researchers_with_research_productivity_fellowship_from_the_Brazilian_National_Council_for_Scientific_and_Technological_Development","51097248_Profile_and_scientific_production_of_CNPq_researchers_in_Nephrology_and_Urology","44684038_Metrics_Do_metrics_matter","42542298_Let's_Make_Science_Metrics_More_Scientific","26357237_Tradicoes_e_contradicoes_da_pos-graduacao_no_Brasil","23411193_Academic_trajectories_of_dental_researchers_receiving_CNPq's_productivity_grants","316007288_A_formacao_de_mestres_em_administracao_por_onde_caminhamos","236003164_Is_there_a_correlation_between_journal_impact_factor_and_researchers'_performance_A_study_comprising_the_fields_of_clinical_nephrology_and_neurosciences","228761414_Responsabilidade_social_e_pos-graduacao_no_Brasil_ideias_para_avali_acao","225158204_Comparison_of_Brazilian_researchers_in_clinical_medicine_Are_criteria_for_ranking_well-adjusted","51575004_Profile_and_Scientific_Production_of_CNPq_Researchers_in_Cardiology","45604159_The_Rate_of_Growth_in_Scientific_Publication_and_the_Decline_in_Coverage_Provided_by_Science_Citation_Index"]}
