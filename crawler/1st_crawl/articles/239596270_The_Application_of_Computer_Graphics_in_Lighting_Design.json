{"id":"239596270_The_Application_of_Computer_Graphics_in_Lighting_Design","abstract":"Computer graphics is a design tool which can be used to analyze a broad range of lighting design problems. The authors developed such a computer graphics program. Luminance patterns is a real or imagined space to be accurately represented on a graphics monitor by using the perceived brightness equivalence concept put forth by the authors. Three luminance-brightness models were used to generate monitor pictures which were evaluated against an actual mockup room. Stevens' model was found to be the most practical to use, and produced the most realistic results.","authors":["Naomi Johnson Miller","Peter Ngai","David D.
