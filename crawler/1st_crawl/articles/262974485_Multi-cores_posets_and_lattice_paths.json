{"id":"262974485_Multi-cores_posets_and_lattice_paths","abstract":"Hooks are prominent in representation theory (of symmetric groups) and they\nplay a role in number theory (via cranks associated to Ramanujan's\ncongruences). A partition of a positive integer $n$ has a Young diagram\nrepresentation. To each cell in the diagram there is an associated statistic\ncalled hook length, and if a number $t$ is absent from the diagram then the\npartition is called a $t$-core. A partition is an $(s,t)$-core if it is both an\n$s$- and a $t$-core. Since the work of Anderson on $(s,t)$-cores, the topic has\nreceived a growing attention. This paper expands the discussion to\nmultiple-cores. More precisely, we explore $(s,s+1,\\dots,s+k)$-core partitions\nmuch in the spirit of a recent paper by Stanley and Zanello. In fact, our\nresults exploit connections between three combinatorial objects: multi-cores,\nposets and lattice paths (with a novel generalization of Dyck paths).\nAdditional results and conjectures are scattered throughout the paper. For\nexample, one of these statements implies a curious symmetry for twin-prime\n$(s,s+2)$-core partitions.","authors":["Tewodros Amdeberhan","Emily Sergel Leven"],"meta":["June 2014Advances in Applied Mathematics 71","DOI:10.1016/j.aam.2015.08.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["47719570_Partitions_with_prescribed_hooksets","285294199_Sur_une_classe_de_problemes_lies_au_treillis_des_partitions_d'entiers","262222203_Partitions_which_are_simultaneously_t_1_and_t_2_-core","259312799_The_Catalan_Case_of_Armstrong's_Conjecture_on_Simultaneous_Core_Partitions","254862999_Results_and_conjectures_on_simultaneous_core_partitions","244454676_Asupra_unei_probleme_de_patitie_a_numerelor","225670066_Block_inclusions_and_cores_of_partitions","50333437_A_Treatise_On_The_Theory_of_Determinants","38336102_A_problem_of_arrangements"]}
