{"id":"336914275_Temporal_Network_Theory","abstract":"This book focuses on the theoretical side of temporal network research and gives an overview of the state of the art in the field. Curated by two pioneers in the field who have helped to shape it, the book contains contributions from many leading researchers. Temporal networks fill the border area between network science and time-series analysis and are relevant for the modeling of epidemics, optimization of transportation and logistics, as well as understanding biological phenomena.\nNetwork theory has proven, over the past 20 years to be one of the most powerful tools for the study and analysis of complex systems. Temporal network theory is perhaps the most recent significant development in the field in recent years, with direct applications to many of the \"big data\" sets. This monograph will appeal to students, researchers and professionals alike interested in theory and temporal networks, a field that has grown tremendously over the last decade.","authors":["Petter Holme","Jari Saram√§ki"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-23495-9","ISBN: 978-3-030-23494-2"],"references":[]}
