{"id":"266656416_Inverted_PBI_in_MOEAD_and_its_impact_on_the_search_performance_on_multi_and_many-objective_optimization","abstract":"MOEA/D decomposes a multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single objective optimization problems. Each single objective optimization problem is defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector. In MOEA/D, there are several scalarizing approaches such as the weighted Tchebycheff, the weighted sum, and the PBI (penalty-based boundary intersection). However, these conventional scalarizing approaches face a difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in some problems. To enhance the spread of Pareto optimal solutions in the objective space and improve the search performance of MOEA/D especially in many-objective optimization problems, in this work we propose the inverted PBI scalarizing approach which is an extension of the conventional PBI. We use many-objective knapsack problems and WFG4 problems with 2-8 objectives, and compare the search performance of NSGA-III and four MOEA/Ds using the weighted Tchebycheff, the weighted sum, the PBI and the inverted PBI. As results, we show that MOEA/D using the inverted PBI achieves higher search performance than other algorithms in problems with many-objectives and the difficulty to obtain a widely spread Pareto front in the objective space.","authors":["Hiroyuki Sato"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1145/2576768.2598297"],"references":["224472028_The_performance_of_a_new_version_of_MOEAD_on_CEC09_unconstrained_MOP_test_instances","220381030_Expensive_Multiobjective_Optimization_by_MOEAD_With_Gaussian_Process_Model","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","3418888_A_review_of_multiobjective_test_problems_and_a_scalable_test_problem_toolkit","291257526_A_Study_on_the_Specification_of_a_Scalarizing_Function_in_MOEAD_for_Many-Objective_Knapsack_Problems","272929205_Nonlinear_Multiobjective_Optimization","264387359_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Using_Reference-Point-Based_Nondominated_Sorting_Approach_Part_I_Solving_Problems_With_Box_Constraints","261021373_A_hybridization_of_MOEAD_with_the_nonlinear_simplex_search_algorithm","235709918_Nonlinear_Multiobjective_Optimization","224645826_Effects_of_d-Similar_Elimination_and_Controlled_Elitism_in_the_NSGA-II_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm","224330083_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_A_Short_Review","220743499_Simultaneous_Use_of_Different_Scalarizing_Functions_in_MOEAD","216457301_Evolutionary_algorithms_for_multiobjective_optimization_Methods_and_applications","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","2526557_A_fast_and_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGAII","2386811_SPEA2_Improving_the_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm","2240388_Thiele_L_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Case_Study_and_the_Strength_Pareto_Approach_IEEE_Trans_on_Evolutionary_Computation_3_257-271"]}
