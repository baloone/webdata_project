{"id":"317228444_Unsupervised_Outlier_Detection_for_Time_Series_by_Entropy_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","abstract":"In the last decade, outlier detection for temporal data has received much attention from data mining and machine learning communities. While other works have addressed this problem by two-way approaches (similarity and clustering), we propose in this paper an embedded technique dealing with both methods simultaneously. We reformulate the task of outlier detection as a weighted clustering problem based on entropy and dynamic time warping for time series. The outliers are then detected by an optimization problem of a new proposed cost function adapted to this kind of data. Finally, we provide some experimental results for validating our proposal and comparing it with other methods of detection.","authors":["Seif-Eddine Benkabou","Khalid Benabdeslem","Canitia Bruno"],"meta":["February 2018Knowledge and Information Systems 54(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10115-017-1067-8"],"references":["302345943_Dynamic_time_warping_averaging_of_time_series_allows_faster_and_more_accurate_classification","301533547_A_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_Algorithms_for_Multivariate_Data","278301657_Hidden_Markov_Anomaly_Detection","289300315_Making_Image_Retrieval_and_Classification_More_Accurate_Using_Time_Series_and_Learned_Constraints","284047773_Searching_and_mining_trillions_of_time_series_subsequences_under_dynamic_time_warping","282927663_A_decomposition_of_the_outlier_detection_problem_into_a_set_of_supervised_learning_problems","281509130_Anomaly_detection_via_online_oversampling_principal_component_analysis","275774734_Identification_of_Outliers","268493544_Identification_of_Outliers","266595260_Outlier_Analysis","241770605_Searching_and_Mining_Trillions_of_Time_Series_Subsequences_under_Dynamic_Time_Warping","265370846_Outliers_in_Time_Series","264561760_Outlier_Detection_for_Temporal_Data_A_Survey","262280938_Community_Trend_Outlier_Detection_Using_Soft_Temporal_Pattern_Mining","254464280_Integrating_community_matching_and_outlier_detection_for_mining_evolutionary_community_outliers"]}
