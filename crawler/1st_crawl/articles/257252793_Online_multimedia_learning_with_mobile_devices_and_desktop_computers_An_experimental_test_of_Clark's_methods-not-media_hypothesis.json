{"id":"257252793_Online_multimedia_learning_with_mobile_devices_and_desktop_computers_An_experimental_test_of_Clark's_methods-not-media_hypothesis","abstract":"Students received an online multimedia lesson on how a solar cell works that consisted of 11 narrated slides with a script of 800 words. Concerning instructional media, students received the lesson on a desktop computer (i.e., iMac) in a lab or on a mobile device (i.e., iPad) in a courtyard. Concerning instructional method, students received a continuous lesson with no headings (standard method) or a segmented lesson in which the learner clicked on a button to go onto the next slide with each slide having a heading corresponding to the key idea in the script for the slide (enhanced method). Across both media, the enhanced group outperformed the standard group on a transfer test (d = .67), yielding a method effect on learning outcomes for both desktop and mobile media. Across both methods, the mobile group produced stronger ratings than the desktop group on self-reported willingness to continue learning (d = .60), yielding a media effect on motivational ratings for both standard and enhanced methods. Effective instructional methods can improve learning outcomes across different media, whereas using hand-held instructional media may increase students’ willingness to continue to engage in learning.","authors":["Eunmo Sung","Richard Mayer"],"meta":["May 2013Computers in Human Behavior 29(3):639–647","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2012.10.022"],"references":["292714369_ESPON_past_present_and_future","281023153_Five_common_but_questionable_principles_of_multimedia_Learning","262915119_Principles_for_reducing_extraneous_processing_in_multimedia_learning_Coherence_signaling_redundancy_spatial_contiguity_and_temporal_contiguity_principles","257947063_Learning_with_Motivation","247357883_Reconsidering_Research_on_Learning_from_Media","238508327_Five_Common_but_Questionable_Principles_of_Multimedia_Learning1","232595492_How_Seductive_Details_Do_Their_Damage_A_Theory_of_Cognitive_Interest_in_Science_Learning","232586652_Learning_by_Doing_Versus_Learning_by_Viewing_Three_Experimental_Comparisons_of_Learner-Generated_Versus_Author-Provided_Graphic_Organizers","232552432_Signaling_in_Expository_Hypertexts_Compensates_for_Deficits_in_Reading_Skill","232494695_Signaling_as_a_Cognitive_Guide_in_Multimedia_Learning","232461853_Optimizing_cognitive_load_for_learning_from_computer-based_science_simulations_Journal_of_Educational_Psychology_98_902-913","225167506_Media_will_never_influence_learning","48829040_When_Learning_Is_Just_a_Click_Away_Does_Simple_User_Interaction_Foster_Deeper_Understanding_of_Multimedia_Messages","37705092_The_Media_Equation_How_People_Treat_Computers_Television_and_New_Media_Like_Real_People_and_Pla","313202151_Research_on_motivation_in_education_Past_present_and_future","304861088_Applying_the_Science_of_Learning","304860437_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","292884042_Principles_for_managing_essential_processing_in_multimedia_learning_Segmenting_pre-training_and_modality_principles","284740066_Principles_for_reducing_extraneous_processing_in_multimedia_learning_Coherence_signaling_redundancy_spatial_contiguity_and_temporal_contiguity_principles","284574292_Self-efficacy_theory","280887137_How_Seductive_Details_Do_Their_Damage_A_Theory_of_Cognitive_Interest_in_Science_Learning","280799108_Signaling_as_a_cognitive_guide_in_multimedia_learning","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","265963762_USE_OF_TOP-LEVEL_STRUCTURE_IN_TEXT_-_KEY_FOR_READING-COMPREHENSION_OF_9TH-GRADE_STUDENTS","262486277_The_fast-paced_iPad_revolution_Can_educators_stay_up_to_date_and_relevant_about_these_ubiquitous_devices","262314935_Effectiveness_of_Computer-Based_Education_in_Colleges","257171167_Students'_beliefs_about_mobile_devices_Vs_desktop_computers_in_South_Korea_and_the_United_States","247870046_The_Evolution_of_American_Educational_Technology","241321605_Contrasts_and_Effect_Sizes_in_Behavioral_Research","232539433_Learning_science_in_virtual_reality_multimedia_environments_Role_of_methods_and_media","232536837_Handbook_of_Children_and_the_Media","232488389_Multimedia_Learning_in_an_Interactive_Self-Explaining_Environment_What_Works_in_the_Design_of_Agent-Based_Microworlds","227983191_Motivation_and_Classroom_Learning","227762444_Impact_of_reducing_intrinsic_cognitive_load_on_learning_in_a_mathematical_domain","222470690_Effectiveness_of_computer-based_instruction_An_updated_analysis","48828888_The_Role_of_Visual_Indicators_in_Dual_Sensory_Mode_Instruction","45095850_Applying_the_science_of_learning_to_medical_education"]}
