{"id":"284097371_Constructing_Permutation_Arrays_from_Groups","abstract":"Let M(n,d) be the maximum size of a permutation array on n symbols with\npairwise Hamming distance at least d. We use various combinatorial, algebraic,\nand computational methods to improve lower bounds for M(n,d). Some lower bounds\nare based on a new computational approach called a coset method. We also use\nalgebraic techniques, involving computing the Hamming distances of affine\nsemilinear groups and projective semilinear groups, and unions of cosets of\nAGL(1,q) and PGL(2,q) with Frobenius maps to obtain infinitely many new,\nimproved lower bounds for M(n,d). We give new randomized algorithms for\ncomputing cosets. For example, we show that M(13,4) is at least 60,635,520,\nwhere 41,712,480 was previously the best lower bound. Furthermore, this\npermutation array consists of a union of 638 cosets of a group of 95,040\npermutations, so it can be recorded and verified quickly. An up-to-date table\nof lower bounds for M(n,d) is also given.","authors":["Sergey Bereg","Avi Levy","Ivan Hal Sudborough"],"meta":["May 2018Designs Codes and Cryptography 86(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-017-0381-1","SourcearXiv","Project: Contraction of Permutation Arrays for Hamming Distances"],"references":["305841753_Extending_permutation_arrays_improving_MOLS_bounds","344552466_Permutation_Groups","319364310_Kronecker_product_and_tiling_of_permutation_arrays_for_hamming_distances","274239366_Topics_in_Algebra","271630277_Permutation_codes_invariant_under_isometries","266599264_Permutation_Groups","265427932_Permutation_Groups","260576541_An_Improvement_on_the_Gilbert-Varshamov_Bound_for_Permutation_Codes","257282686_Abstract_Algebra","247148638_Permutation_codes_for_discrete_channels"]}
