{"id":"332605383_Active_learning_methodologies_A_brief_review","abstract":"Historically, traditional teaching methods have seen the teacher as a figure of authority over the student. However, the social changes have leading to perceptual shift in the teaching-learning process, promoting the emergence of the so-called ‘active learning methodologies’. In these methodologies, the student becomes the central protagonist. Its applications allow the development of new skills, such as initiative, creativity, reflexive criticism, self-assessment ability and cooperation in teamwork. The teacher acts as advisor, supervisor and facilitator of the process. This article aims to be a brief review, presenting the background, fundamentals and classifications of active learning methodologies. We also propose a categorization of such methods in collaborative and cooperative learnings The use of active methodologies is an alternative way of seeking the interest and motivation of the students of this 21st century.","authors":["F.L.
