{"id":"222453699_Bernstein-Bezier_polynomials_on_spheres_and_sphere-like_surfaces","abstract":"In this paper we discuss a natural way to define barycentric coordinates on general sphere-like surfaces. This leads to a theory of Bernstein-Bézier polynomials which parallels the familiar planar case. Our constructions are based on a study of homogeneous polynomials on trihedra in 3. The special case of Bernstein-Bézier polynomials on a sphere is considered in detail.","authors":["Peter Alfeld","Mike Neamtu","Larry L.
