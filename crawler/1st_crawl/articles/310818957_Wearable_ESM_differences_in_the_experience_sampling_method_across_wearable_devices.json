{"id":"310818957_Wearable_ESM_differences_in_the_experience_sampling_method_across_wearable_devices","abstract":"The Experience Sampling Method is widely used for collecting self-report responses from people in natural settings. While most traditional approaches rely on using a phone to trigger prompts and record information, wearable devices now offer new opportunities that may improve this method. This research quantitatively and qualitatively studies the experience sampling process on head-worn and wrist-worn wearable devices, and compares them to the traditional \"smartphone in the pocket.\" To enable this work, we designed and implemented a custom application to provide similar prompts across the three types of devices and evaluated it with 15 individuals for five days (75 days total), in the context of real-life stress measurement. We found significant differences in response times across devices, and captured tradeoffs in interaction types, screen size, and device familiarity that can affect both users' experience and the reports made by users.","authors":["Javier Hernandez","Daniel McDuff","Christian Infante","Pattie Maes"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1145/2935334.2935340","Conference: the 18th International Conference"],"references":["301449442_Input_Methods_for_the_Borg-RPE-Scale_on_Smartwatches","300725815_Exploring_the_Use_of_Google_Glass_in_Wet_Laboratories","287636769_Towards_Personal_Stress_Informatics_Comparing_Minimally_Invasive_Techniques_for_Measuring_Daily_Stress_in_the_Wild","284679411_Ecological_momentary_assessment","275225305_ESM_20_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Potential_of_Experience_Sampling_Methods_in_Organizational_Research","263131441_Comparison_of_text_messaging_and_paper-and-pencil_for_ecological_momentary_assessment_of_food_craving_and_intake","261960929_A_Large-Scale_Study_of_Daily_Information_Needs_Captured_In_Situ","258190002_Palm_or_Cell_Comparing_Personal_Digital_Assistants_and_Cell_Phones_for_Experience_Sampling_Research","235361517_A_Circumplex_Model_of_Affect","234813806_MyExperience_A_system_for_in_situ_tracing_and_capturing_of_user_feedback_on_mobile_phones","221270794_Reconexp_a_way_to_reduce_the_data_loss_of_the_experiencing_sampling_method","38075591_Experience_Sampling_Methods_A_Modern_Idiographic_Approach_to_Personality_Research","11920243_The_Job_Demands-Resources_Model_of_Burnout","10974933_Diary_Methods_Capturing_Life_as_it_is_Lived","8150315_A_Survey_Method_for_Characterizing_Daily_Life_Experience_The_Day_Reconstruction_Method","5340880_Ecolocial_Momentary_Assessment","301411135_Diary-Like_Long-Term_Activity_Recognition_Touch_or_Voice_Interaction","267806777_Using_the_Experience_Sampling_Method_to_Evaluate_Ubicomp_Applications_Version_1_Submission_date_Jan_20_2003","259823299_Experience_Sampling_Method_Measuring_the_Quality_of_Everyday_Life","259652915_The_ecology_of_adolescent_activity_and_experience","242339416_The_Job_Demands-Resources_Model_State_of_the_Art","241623312_FEEL_frequent_EDA_and_event_logging_--_a_mobile_social_interaction_stress_monitoring_system","232528020_The_Experience_Sampling_Method","3436984_Walker_M_Using_the_Experience_Sampling_Method_to_Evaluate_Ubicomp_Applications_IEEE_Pervasive_Computing_22_24-31"]}
