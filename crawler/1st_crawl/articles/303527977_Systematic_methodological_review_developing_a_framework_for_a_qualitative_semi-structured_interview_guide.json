Background\nRigorous data collection procedures fundamentally influence the results of studies. The semi-structured interview is a common data collection method, but methodological research on the development of a semi-structured interview guide is sparse. DesignSystematic methodological review. Data sourcesWe searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for methodological papers on semi-structured interview guides from October 2004-September 2014. Having examined 2,703 titles and abstracts and 21 full texts, we finally selected 10 papers. Review methodsWe analysed the data using the qualitative content analysis method. ResultsOur analysis resulted in new synthesized knowledge on the development of a semi-structured interview guide, including five phases: (1) identifying the prerequisites for using semi-structured interviews; (2) retrieving and using previous knowledge; (3) formulating the preliminary semi-structured interview guide; (4) pilot testing the guide; and (5) presenting the complete semi-structured interview guide. Conclusion\nRigorous development of a qualitative semi-structured interview guide contributes to the objectivity and trustworthiness of studies and makes the results more plausible. Researchers should consider using this five-step process to develop a semi-structured interview guide and justify the decisions made during it.","authors":["Hanna Kallio","Anna-Maija Pietil√§","Martin Johnson","Mari Kangasniemi"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Advanced Nursing 72(12)","DOI:10.1111/jan.13031"],"references":["320353627_Qualitative_research_design_An_interactive_approach","286864188_How_I_Learned_to_Design_and_Conduct_Semi-structured_Interviews_An_Ongoing_and_Continuous_Journey","285533171_Interviewing_the_Investigator_Strategies_for_Addressing_Instrumentation_and_Researcher_Bias_Concerns_in_Qualitative_Research","273311573_Qualitative_research_with_families_living_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_Recommendations_for_conducting_semistructured_interviews","266159913_Considering_methodological_options_for_reviews_of_theory_Illustrated_by_a_review_of_theories_linking_income_and_health","263767248_A_practical_guide_to_using_Interpretative_Phenomenological_Analysis_in_qualitative_research_psychology","232446190_Quality_and_Trustworthiness_in_Qualitative_Research_in_Counseling_Psychology","228708239_Strategies_for_Ensuring_Trustworthiness_in_Qualitative_Research_Projects","224910991_Preliminary_Investigation_and_Interview_Guide_Development_for_Studying_how_Malaysian_Farmers'_Form_their_Mental_Models_of_Farming","43220402_Qualitative_Research_Design_An_Interactive_Approach_JA_Maxwell","7205220_The_qualitative_research_interview","5573243_Quality_in_qualitative_research","5495328_Methods_of_data_collection_in_qualitative_research_Interviews_and_focus_groups","312920142_How_to_investigate_the_use_of_medicines_by_consumers","307981795_Qualitative_Interviewing_The_Art_of_Hearing_Data","290986336_Mastering_the_semi-structured_interview_and_beyond_From_research_design_to_analysis_and_publication","287474206_Semistructured_interview","283082784_Semi-structured_interviews_guidance_for_novice_researchers","273052884_Naturalistic_Inquiry","272136733_Qualitative_research_in_health_care","271104580_Qualitative_Interviewing_The_Art_of_Hearing_Data","265989424_Qualitative_Interview_Design_A_Practical_Guide_for_Novice_Investigators","265261950_Rethinking_semiotics_in_qualitative_research","263858898_Rethinking_quality_in_qualitative_research","259954448_Qualitative_research_Quality_results","256645304_Essentials_of_Nursing_Research_Appraising_Evidence_for_Nursing_Practice","248437021_Naturalistic_inquiry_Beverly_Hills_CA_Sage_Publications_1985_416_pp_2500_Cloth","247399859_Qualitative_Psychology_APractical_Guide_to_Research_Methods","234055873_While_A_Collecting_data_using_a_semi-structured_interview_A_discussion_paper_Journal_of_Advanced_Nursing_192_328-335","233913264_Assessing_the_quality_of_qualitative_research","228003072_Doing_Interpretative_Phenomenological_Analysis","45147744_Semi-Structured_Interviewing_in_Practice-Close_Research","15236284_Two_approaches_to_the_study_of_experiences_of_health_and_old_age_the_thematic_interview_and_the_narrative_method","15010230_Collecting_data_using_a_semi-structured_interview_A_discussion_paper","12689566_Analysing_Qualitative_Data_IN_Qualitative_Research_in_Health_Care","7545086_A_Reflection_on_the_Use_of_Semi-Structured_Interviews","5766259_What_Have_Sampling_and_Data_Collection_got_to_do_with_Good_Qualitative_Research","5499399_The_qualitative_content_analysis"]}
