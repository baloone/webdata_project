{"id":"299453318_LSDV-Hop_Least_Squares_Based_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have increasingly become a hot spot of research and application in the fields of computer networks and telecommunications. It is undoubtedly one of the most important issues for WSNs to search an accurate and effective localization method. In this paper, an improved DV-Hop localization algorithm, called least squares DV-Hop (LSDV-Hop), is proposed based on the theory of least squares. LSDV-Hop aims to improve the localization accuracy by extracting a least squares transformation vector between the true and estimated location data of anchor nodes which are randomly chosen. Then, the estimated location data of unknown nodes are updated by the obtained least squares transformation vector, which is helpful to weaken the error of the traditional DV-Hop algorithm. Results of simulation experiments show that the proposed LSDV-Hop method can improve the localization accuracy without increasing the hardware cost for sensor nodes compared with the counterparts.","authors":["Shujing Zhang","Jing Li","Bo He","Jiaxing Chen"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of Communications 11(3):243-248","DOI:10.12720/jcm.11.3.243-248"],"references":["286524336_Two_Novel_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithms_for_Randomly_Deployed_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","283124630_Amorphous_Localization_Algorithm_Based_on_BP_Artificial_Neural_Network","259978472_Non-Line-of-Sight_Node_Localization_Based_on_Semi-Definite_Programming_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","258794273_Localization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Byzantines_and_Mitigation_Techniques","224321934_An_improved_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","224214985_Radio_Frequency_Time-of-Flight_Distance_Measurement_for_Low-Cost_Wireless_Sensor_Localization","220134474_Mobility-Assisted_Node_Localization_Based_on_TOA_Measurements_Without_Time_Synchronization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3344127_Gps-less_Low_Cost_Outdoor_Localization_for_Very_Small_Devices","3282977_Positioning_in_ad_hoc_sensor_networks","313569320_An_improved_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","297091724_Improved_DV-hop_algorithm_for_higher_positioning_accuracy","271545556_The_research_on_Wireless_Sensor_Network_node_positioning_based_on_DV-hop_algorithm_and_cuckoo_searching_algorithm","269505797_An_Average_One-hop_Distance_Estimation_Algorithm_Based_on_Weighted_Disposal_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","269296366_Research_of_three-dimensional_localization_algorithm_based_on_DV-Hop_AC-PSO","265855859_Localization_Based_on_Adaptive_Regulated_Neighborhood_Distance_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_With_a_General_Radio_Propagation_Model","261923747_Efficient_Closed-Form_Algorithms_for_AOA_Based_Self-Localization_of_Sensor_Nodes_Using_Auxiliary_Variables","260358244_TDoA_for_Passive_Localization_Underwater_versus_Terrestrial_Environment","257640819_Enhanced_calibration_technique_for_RSSI-based_ranging_in_body_area_networks","220926101_Range-free_localization_schemes_for_large_scale_sensor_networks","220183320_A_Method_for_Registration_of_3-D_Shapes"]}
