{"id":"235552329_Reexamination_of_quantum_data_compression_and_relative_entropy","abstract":"Schumacher and Westmoreland Phys. Rev. A 64 42304 (2001) have established a quantum analog of a well-known classical information theory result on a role of relative entropy as a measure of nonoptimality in (classical) data compression. In this paper, we provide an alternative simple and constructive proof of this result by constructing quantum compression codes (schemes) from classical data compression codes. Moreover, as the quantum data compression or coding task can be effectively reduced to a (quasi)classical one, we show that relevant results from classical information theory and data compression become applicable and therefore can be extended to the quantum domain.","authors":["Alexei Kaltchenko"],"meta":["August 2008Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 78(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.78.022311","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220490049_Time_and_Space_Bounds_for_Reversible_Simulation","2185152_Indeterminate-length_quantum_coding","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","235490842_Quantum_coding","226117925_Time_and_Space_Bounds_for_Reversible_Simulation","224773133_Elements_of_information_theory_2nd_ed","224754157_Universal_non-destructive_estimation_of_Quantum_relative_entropy","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","3078027_A_Measure_of_Relative_Entropy_Between_Individual_Sequences_with_Application_to_Universal_Classification","2858151_Generic_Quantum_Block_Compression","2441438_Quantum_complexity_theory_SIAM_J_Comput","2189106_Universal_quantum_information_compression_and_degrees_of_prior_knowledge","2185651_The_Role_of_Relative_Entropy_in_Quantum_Information_Theory"]}
