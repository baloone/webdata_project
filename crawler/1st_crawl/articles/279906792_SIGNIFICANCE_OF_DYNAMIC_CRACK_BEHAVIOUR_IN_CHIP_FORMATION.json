{"id":"279906792_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_DYNAMIC_CRACK_BEHAVIOUR_IN_CHIP_FORMATION","abstract":"In-situ examinations of chip formation of pure aluminum, 6-4 brass, low carbon steel, resulphurized steel and leaded steel have been carried out using a new experimental technique, which makes possible direct observation of the orthogonal micromachining process at controlled cutting temperatures inside a scanning electron microscope. To investigate the crack behavior, local stress-strain distributions are calculated. Crack formation is observed in the primary shear zone due to void formation around nondeformable inclusions and brittle fracture of inclusions. It is also observed in the vicinity of the tool cutting edge due to collision of inclusions with the cutting edge. The types of chip formation, cutting force characteristics, and surface integrities are discussed in association with the crack formation and its propagation mechanism","authors":["Kazuaki Iwata","Kanji Ueda"],"meta":["January 1976"],"references":[]}
