{"id":"352311535_Two-Phase_Bidirectional_Dual-Relay_Selection_Strategy_for_Wireless_Relay_Networks","abstract":"In this article, we introduce a new bi-directional dual-relay selection strategy with its bit error rate (BER) performance analysis. During the first step of the proposed strategy, two relays out of a set of N relay-nodes are selected in a way to optimize the system performance in terms of BER, based on the suggested algorithm which checks if the selected relays using the max-min criterion are the best ones. In the second step, the chosen relay-nodes perform an orthogonal space-time coding scheme using the two-phase relaying protocol to establish a bi-directional communication between the communicating terminals, leading to a significant improvement in the achievable coding and diversity gain. To further improve the overall system performance, the selected relay-nodes apply also a digital network coding scheme. Furthermore, this paper discusses the analytical approximation of the BER performance of the proposed strategy, where we prove that the analytical results match almost perfectly the simulated ones. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the current state-of-the-art ones.","authors":["Issam Maaz","Samer Alabed","Mohammad Al-Rabayah"],"meta":["June 2021Computers, Materials and Continua 69(1):539-553","DOI:10.32604/cmc.2021.018061"],"references":["340976152_A_Hybrid_Downlink_Scheduling_Approach_for_Multi-Traffic_Classes_in_LTE_Wireless_Systems","332452088_Performance_analysis_of_bi-directional_relay_selection_strategy_for_wireless_cooperative_communications","326628385_Performance_Analysis_of_Differential_Beamforming_in_Decentralized_Networks","319697895_Design_and_Analysis_of_Relay-Selection_Strategies_for_Two-Way_Relay_Network-Coded_DCSK_Systems","329151745_Performance_Enhancement_for_Energy_Harvesting_Based_Two-Way_Relay_Protocols_in_Wireless_Ad-hoc_Networks_with_Partial_and_Full_Relay_Selection_Methods","327486042_Content-aware_downlink_scheduling_for_LTE_wireless_systems_A_survey_and_performance_comparison_of_key_approaches","290785596_Relay_selection_based_space-time_coding_for_two-way_wireless_relay_networks_using_digital_network_coding","285536294_Bi-directional_differential_beamforming_for_multi-antenna_relaying","273768998_Optimal_general-rank_transmit_beamforming_technique_for_single-group_multicasting_service_in_modern_wireless_networks_using_STTC","271561023_Non-coherent_distributed_space-time_coding_techniques_for_two-way_wireless_relay_networks","260835944_Max-Ratio_Relay_Selection_in_Secure_Buffer-Aided_Cooperative_Wireless_Networks","260672967_Relay_Selection_Schemes_and_Performance_Analysis_Approximations_for_Two-Way_Networks","261430301_Rank-two_beamforming_for_single-group_multicasting_networks_using_OSTBC","260657083_A_Simple_Distributed_Space-Time_Coded_Strategy_for_Two-Way_Relay_Channels","260508632_Interference-Aware_Relay_Selection_Scheme_for_Two-Hop_Relay_Networks_With_Multiple_Source-Destination_Pairs"]}
