{"id":"337595341_A_Pilot_Study_on_Developing_Newsgames_in_Collaboration_between_Journalism_and_Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"Producing digital and interactive journalistic products offers unique and important new learning opportunities for journalism education. This study analysed the experiences of two pilot courses on so-called ‘newsgames’ in a Finnish university in 2015 and 2017. The data consisted of the newsgames and other materials produced by the students, student feedback concerning the course and observations of teachers throughout the project. Our analysis demonstrates how producing newsgames in the context of higher education may foster project-based learning experiences, something that has been relatively rare in traditional journalism education. Collaboration with media companies also offered valuable feedback for the students throughout the course and provided them with an opportunity to practice selling their expertise. The study highlights how interdisciplinary and project-based cooperation may benefit journalism education.","authors":["Marko Siitonen","Panu Uotila","Turo Uskali","Jukka Varsaluoma"],"meta":["March 2019Nordicom Review 40(2):143-155","DOI:10.2478/nor-2019-0038"],"references":["326904962_Play_the_News_Fun_and_Games_in_Digital_Journalism","315111170_The_Datafication_of_Data_Journalism_Scholarship_Focal_Points_Methods_and_Research_Propositions_for_the_Investigation_of_Data-intensive_Newswork","310592720_A_Census_of_Statistics_Requirements_at_US_Journalism_Programs_and_a_Model_for_a_Statistics_for_Journalism_Course_Journalism_Mass_Communication_Educator","298796401_Co-Teaching_In_Higher_Education","281314978_The_Perils_of_Project-Based_Work_Attempting_Resistance_to_Extreme_Work_Practices_in_Video_Game_Development","325379851_What_is_responsible_drone_journalism","319017847_Are_Newsgames_Better_Journalism_Empathy_information_and_Representation_in_Games_on_Refugees_and_Migrants","298796388_Co-Teaching_In_Higher_Education","292654509_News_as_entertainment_The_rise_of_global_infotainment","292640743_Epilogue_Back_into_the_future_re-inventing_journalism_education_in_the_age_of_globalization"]}
