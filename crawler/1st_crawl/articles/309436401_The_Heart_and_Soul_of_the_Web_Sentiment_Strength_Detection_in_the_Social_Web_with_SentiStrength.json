{"id":"309436401_The_Heart_and_Soul_of_the_Web_Sentiment_Strength_Detection_in_the_Social_Web_with_SentiStrength","abstract":"Emotions are important in communication to effectively convey messages and to understand reactions to messages. Large scale studies of communication need methods to detect sentiment in order to investigate or model the processes involved. This chapter describes the sentiment strength detection program SentiStrength that was developed during the CyberEmotions project to detect the strength of sentiments expressed in social web texts. SentiStrength uses a lexical approach that exploits a list of sentiment-related terms and has rules to deal with standard linguistic and social web methods to express sentiment, such as emoticons, exaggerated punctuation and deliberate misspellings. This chapter also describes how SentiStrength can be refined for particular topics and contexts and how variants can be created for different languages. The chapter also briefly describes some studies that have applied SentiStrength to analyse trends in Twitter and You Tube comments.","authors":["Mike Thelwall"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-43639-5_7","In book: Cyberemotions (pp.119-134)"],"references":["262426283_Commenting_on_YouTube_Videos_From_Guatemalan_Rock_to_El_Big_Bang","255569148_Damping_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Online_Communication_Discussions_Monologs_and_Dialogs","254304133_Clues_for_Detecting_Irony_in_User-Generated_Contents_Oh_It's_so_easy_-","239489124_Cues_Filtered_Out_Cues_Filtered_In_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Relationships","233893905_Emotion_Science_Cognitive_and_Neuroscientific_Approaches_to_Understanding_Human_Emotions","230838464_Current_Emotion_Research_in_Psychophysiology_The_Neurobiology_of_Evaluative_Bivalence","221520084_A_large-scale_sentiment_analysis_for_Yahoo_Answers","220874376_Identifying_Sarcasm_in_Twitter_A_Closer_Look","216011791_Emoticons_and_Online_Message_Interpretation","215470778_The_General_Inquirer_A_Computer_Approach_to_Content_Analysis","51548861_Collective_Emotions_Online_and_Their_Influence_on_Community_Life","11202686_Psychological_Aspects_of_Natural_Language_Use_Our_Words_Our_Selves","312751389_Commenting_on_YouTube_videos_From_Guatemalan_Rock_to_El_Big_Bang","278659270_Computer_and_Information_Sciences_III","260357037_Topic-Based_sentiment_analysis_for_the_Social_Web_The_role_of_mood_and_issue-related_words","221520179_Answers_not_links_Extracting_tips_from_Yahoo_Answers_to_address_how-to_web_queries","221298009_ICWSM_-_A_Great_Catchy_Name_Semi-Supervised_Recognition_of_Sarcastic_Sentences_in_Online_Product_Reviews","220435469_Identifying_and_characterizing_public_science-related_fears_from_RSS_feeds","220435161_Sentiment_Strength_Detection_for_the_Social_Web","220435012_Sentiment_in_Twitter_Events","220017639_Content_Analysis_An_Introduction_To_Its_Methodology"]}
