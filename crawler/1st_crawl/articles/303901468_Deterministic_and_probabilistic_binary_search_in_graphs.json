{"id":"303901468_Deterministic_and_probabilistic_binary_search_in_graphs","abstract":"We consider the following natural generalization of Binary Search: in a given undirected, positively weighted graph, one vertex is a target. The algorithm’s task is to identify the target by adaptively querying vertices. In response to querying a node q, the algorithm learns either that q is the target, or is given an edge out of q that lies on a shortest path from q to the target. We study this problem in a general noisy model in which each query independently receives a correct answer with probability p > 1/2 (a known constant), and an (adversarial) incorrect one with probability 1 − p.\nOur main positive result is that when p = 1 (i.e., all answers are correct), log2n queries are always sufficient. For general p, we give an (almost information-theoretically optimal) algorithm that uses, in expectation, no more than (1 − δ) logn/1 − H(p) + o(logn) + O(log² (1/δ)) queries, and identifies the target correctly with probability at leas 1 − δ. Here, H(p) = −(p logp + (1 − p) log(1 − p)) denotes the entropy. The first bound is achieved by the algorithm that iteratively queries a 1-median of the nodes not ruled out yet; the second bound by careful repeated invocations of a multiplicative weights algorithm.\nEven for p = 1, we show several hardness results for the problem of determining whether a target can be found using K queries. Our upper bound of log2n implies a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for undirected connected graphs; we show that this is best-possible under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Furthermore, for directed graphs, or for undirected graphs with non-uniform node querying costs, the problem is PSPACE-complete. For a semi-adaptive version, in which one may query r nodes each in k rounds, we show membership in Σ2k−1 in the polynomial hierarchy, and hardness for Σ2k−5.","authors":["Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh","David Kempe","Vikrant Singhal"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2897518.2897656","Conference: the 48th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["254211773_Twenty_Questions_with_Noise_Bayes_Optimal_Policies_for_Entropy_Loss","221498743_The_Bayesian_Learner_is_Optimal_for_Noisy_Binary_Search_and_Pretty_Good_for_Quantum_as_Well","220992964_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_of_Small_Depth_Circuits","220780224_On_Playing_Twenty_Questions_with_a_Liar","220618283_Computing_with_Noisy_Information","2624184_Optimal_Search_in_Trees","315587697_Searching_in_random_partially_ordered_sets","308846160_Tight_Hardness_Results_for_LCS_and_Other_Sequence_Similarity_Measures","308806447_Quadratic_Conditional_Lower_Bounds_for_String_Problems_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","304233493_Active_learning_from_noisy_and_abstention_feedback","282719809_Approximating_the_best_Nash_Equilibrium_in_no_1ogn-time_breaks_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","279546158_INTERVAL_ESTIMATION_PROBLEM_FOR_CONTROLLED_OBSERVATIONS","276466259_Bayesian_Active_Learning_With_Non-Persistent_Noise","271855479_Quadratic_Conditional_Lower_Bounds_for_String_Problems_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","268645905_On_a_problem_of_information_theory","268627474_Searching_in_random_partially_ordered_sets_extended_abstract","267004817_Computational_Complexity","266715465_Bisection_Search_with_Noisy_Responses","250600608_Searching_with_a_Constant_Rate_of_Malicious_Lies","239566694_Sur_les_Assemblage_de_Lignes","237062601_Adventures_of_a_Mathematician","236628854_Computational_Complexity","228057894_Computational_Complexity","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","225350966_Optimal_Edge_Ranking_of_Trees_in_Linear_Time","223707199_Searching_games_with_errors_-_Fifty_years_of_coping_with_liars","223460967_Least_adaptive_optimal_search_with_unreliable_tests","222617821_Coping_with_Errors_in_Binary_Search_Procedures","222603084_Families_of_k-independent_sets","222521916_On_the_complexity_of_k-SAT","222229433_Searching_with_Known_Error_Probability","222164768_Edge_ranking_of_graphs_is_hard","221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221618982_Noisy_Generalized_Binary_Search","221590506_Comparison-based_search_in_the_presence_of_errors","221499674_Generalization_of_Binary_Search_Searching_in_Trees_and_Forest-Like_Partial_Orders","220779979_On_binary_searching_with_non-uniform_costs","220779587_Finding_an_optimal_tree_searching_strategy_in_linear_time","220779539_Noisy_binary_search_and_its_applications","220571090_Edge_ranking_and_searching_in_partial_orders","220406504_Searching_Ordered_Structures","220153266_On_the_complexity_of_searching_in_trees_and_partially_ordered_structures","220114443_Optimal_Node_Ranking_of_Trees","220113994_Optimal_Node_Ranking_of_Trees_in_Linear_Time","38365999_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Expected_Sample_Size_in_Certain_One_Sided_Tests","37997127_Noise_tolerant_algorithms_for_learning_and_searching","3084550_Sequential_Transmission_Using_Noiseless_Feedback","2722640_The_Coast_of_Searching_in_General_Trees_versus_Complete_Binary_Trees"]}
