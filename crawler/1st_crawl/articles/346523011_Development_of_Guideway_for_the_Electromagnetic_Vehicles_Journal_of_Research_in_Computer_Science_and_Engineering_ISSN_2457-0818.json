These forms of vehicles will be used in harsh environments, wherever ancient vehicles may not survive. This technology has two active elements; one is that the vehicle or moving the body and another is the guide-way for the vehicle. The main advantage is that those two-parts don't bite one another, as magnetism implies here. To determine this, conditioned power is required to energize the vehicle and guide-way. Magnetism could be a development, happens once a moving charge exerts a force on different moving charges, the magnetic-force created by these moving charges. With the advanced materials, low-cost, high-speed computing systems make it possible to build levitation as a commonplace and integral part of our life. In this project, we are going to focus on developing a Guide-way mistreatment Microcontroller. To control electronically, the levitation magnets are put in on either side with the full vehicle that keeps it on the required vertical distance over magnetic-attractive-forces, and also the steering magnets keep It supports the vehicles suspended on the guide-way while not in contact. The driving element is put in on the Guide-way of stator coil packs. The main reason for this project is to know the dynamic characteristics of the Guide-way and to develop a sturdy numerical methodology for simulating the coupled system.\n\n[Journal link: http://mantechpublications.com/admin/index.php/JoCSE/issue/view/2841 ]","authors":["Al Mahmud Al Mamun","Md.
