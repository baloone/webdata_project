{"id":"306233844_Zagreb_Polynomials_of_Three_Graph_Operators","abstract":"In general, the relations among Zagreb polynomials on three graph operators are discussed in this paper. Specifically, relations between Zagreb polynomials of a graph G and a graph obtained by applying the operators S(G), R(G) and Q(G) are investigated. In a separate section, the relation between Zagreb polynomial of a graph G and its corona is also described.","authors":["A. R.
