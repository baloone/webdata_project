{"id":"311491383_Contextualized_Teaching_in_the_Lower_Secondary_EducationLong-term_Evaluation_of_a_CS_Course_from_Grade_6_to_10","abstract":"In this paper we will report on the design, teaching and evaluation of a Computer Science course in the lower secondary education from grade 6 to grade 10 based on contextualised ideas.\nWith this study we are able to demonstrate that students can indeed be taught Computer Science as a (main) subject from early grades to the end of lower secondary education.\nWe will present quantitative and qualitative results. We will analyse the results of the course with the instrument of the effect size d and draw first consequences.\nSo it becomes apparent that Computer Science can be taught just like any other science worth full curriculum credit even starting at the beginning of the lower secondary education.","authors":["Arno Pasternak"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1145/2839509.2844592","Conference: the 47th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["274377900_Computational_Thinking","274309848_Computational_Thinking","266654886_Computational_thinking_skills_in_Dutch_secondary_education","262206323_The_introduction_of_computer_Science_to_NZ_high_schools_-_An_analysis_of_student_work","228889681_Computer_Science_in_New_Zealand_High_Schools","221537542_A_model_for_high_school_computer_science_education_the_four_key_elements_that_make_it","311475014_The_development_and_implementation_of_a_context-based_curricular_framework_for_computer_science_education_in_high_schools","284213383_The_CS10K_initiative_-_part_2_-_progress_in_K--12_through_computer_science_principles","282532676_The_CS10K_initiative","281345387_Bildungsstandards_im_Fach_Physik_fur_den_Mittleren_Schulabschluss_Beschluss_vom_16122004","276455906_Computer_Science_Education_in_North-Rhine_Westphalia_Germany-A_Case_Study","274968972_Bridging_ICT_and_CS","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","266655059_Adoption_of_new_computer_science_high_school_standards_by_New_Zealand_teachers","254004862_Computer_science_principles_and_the_CS_10K_initiative","234794185_Teaching_computer_science_in_context","234789601_Does_contextualized_computing_education_help","221537717_Braided_teaching_in_secondary_CS_education_Contexts_continuity_and_the_role_of_programming","220691288_Mind_Over_Machine_The_Power_of_Human_Intuition_and_Expertise_in_the_Era_of_Computer","220423571_Teaching_Computing_to_Everyone","44847045_Statistical_power_ANALYSIS_for_the_Behavioral_sciences","44831648_Literacy_Skills_for_the_World_of_Tomorrow_Further_Results_from_PISA_2000","44823625_Measuring_student_knowledge_and_skills_a_new_framework_for_assessment_Paris_OECD","2954905_Scripting_Higher-Level_Programming_for_the_21st_Century"]}
