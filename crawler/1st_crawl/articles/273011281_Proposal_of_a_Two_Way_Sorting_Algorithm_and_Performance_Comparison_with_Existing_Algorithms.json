{"id":"273011281_Proposal_of_a_Two_Way_Sorting_Algorithm_and_Performance_Comparison_with_Existing_Algorithms","abstract":"An algorithm is any well-defined procedure or set of instructions, that takes some input in the form of some values, processes them and gives some values as output. Sorting involves rearranging information into either ascending or descending order. Sortingis considered as a fundamental operation in computer science as it is used as an intermediate step in many operations. A new sorting algorithm namely ‘An Endto-End Bi-directional Sorting (EEBS) Algorithm’ is proposed to address the shortcomings of the current popular sorting algorithms. The goal of this research is to perform an extensive empirical analysis of the newly developed algorithm and present its functionality. The results of the analysis proved that EEBS is much more efficient than the other alg orithms having O(n 2 ) complexity, like bubble, selection and insertion sort.","authors":["Eshan Kapur"],"meta":["June 2012International Journal of Computer Science Engineering and Applications 2(3):61-78","DOI:10.5121/ijcsea.2012.2306"],"references":["272609538_Optimized_Selection_Sort_Algorithm_is_faster_than_Insertion_Sort_Algorithm_a_Comparative_Study","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms"]}
