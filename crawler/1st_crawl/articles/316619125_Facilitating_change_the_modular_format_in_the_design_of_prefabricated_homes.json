Its focus is a live case study of a 3 storey prefabricated apartment block. The goal is to explore the utility and effectiveness of this tool and its ability to facilitate change. A parametric model of the apartment block is made and various aspects of the modular format are applied to its assembly and components. Combined as a computational design and building assembly tool, the benefits of the modular format may be exploited. Thus flexibility, adaptability, changeability and reusability are maximised. Whilst fully interactive integration of the modular format may not yet be possible, it is hoped that its incorporation into the complexities of the architectural design process may at least result in more authentic outcomes.","authors":["Robert Doe","Mathew Aitchison"],"meta":["December 2016","Conference: Architectural Science Association 2016At: Adelaide, Australia"],"references":["234799990_Christopher_Alexander_An_Introduction_for_Object-Oriented_Designers","228843549_Untangling_Parametric_Schemata_Enhancing_Collaboration_through_Modular_Programming","323694162_Mobius_A_Parametric_Modeller_for_the_Web","303309464_Sketchpad_a_man-machine_graphical_communication_system","301354977_Modelled_on_Software_Engineering_Flexible_Parametric_Models_in_the_Practice_of_Architecture","270385877_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form","261289043_The_Timeless_Way_of_Building","257371489_Configuration_through_the_parameterization_of_building_components","225646968_Rudolph_M_Schindler-Proportion_Scale_and_the_Row","225457894_Rudolph_M_Schindler-Space_Reference_Frame_Modular_Coordination_and_the_Row"]}
