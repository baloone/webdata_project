The internal heat and mass transfer within the phases in the reactor were considered using the film theory. The conservation equations for energy and mass were solved simultaneously using appropriate numerical techniques whose reliability was assessed by comparison of the results with previously reported experimental data. The modelling was performed with consideration of two proposed hydrocracking kinetic models. The model predictions showed reasonable correlation with published experimental data and conversion rates. The calculations indicated that at feed temperature of 380 °C, liquid hourly space velocity of 8 h−1 and hydrogen : feed ratio of 1500:1, the total triglyceride conversion was 82.54% for four major classes of hydrocarbons (light, middle, heavy and oligomerised). In addition, the concentration distribution and temperature profile along the reactor were investigated. The product concentrations along the reactor show that higher rates of production at the beginning of the reactor were achieved because of high concentration of triglyceride due to the exothermic hydrocracking reactions and counter-current flow modes of triglyceride and hydrogen; a jump of 90 °C was shown at the beginning of the reactor temperature profile.
