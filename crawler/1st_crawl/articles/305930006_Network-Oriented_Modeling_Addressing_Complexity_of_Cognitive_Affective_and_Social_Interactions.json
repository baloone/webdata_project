{"id":"305930006_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Addressing_Complexity_of_Cognitive_Affective_and_Social_Interactions","abstract":"This book has been written with a multidisciplinary audience in mind without assuming much prior knowledge. In principle, the detailed presentation in the book makes that it can be used as an introduction in Network-Oriented Modelling for multidisciplinary Master and Ph.D. students. In particular, this implies that, although also some more technical mathematical and formal logical aspects have been addressed within the book, they have been kept minimal, and are presented in a concentrated and easily avoidable manner in Part IV. Much of the material in this book has been and is being used in teaching multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate students, and based on these experiences the presentation has been improved much. Sometimes some overlap between chapters can be found in order to make it easier to read each chapter separately. Lecturers can contact me for additional material such as slides, assignments, and software\nSpringer full-text download: http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-45213-5","authors":["Jan Treur"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-45213-5","Edition: Series on Understanding Complex Systems, 2016Publisher: Springer PublishersISBN: 978-3-319-45211-1","Projects: Behaviour Dynamics in Social NetworksNetwork-Oriented Modeling: Conceptual Foundations and Applicability"],"references":[]}
