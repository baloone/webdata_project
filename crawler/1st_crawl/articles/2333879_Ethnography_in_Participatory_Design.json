{"id":"2333879_Ethnography_in_Participatory_Design","abstract":"Even the most cursory glance through recent proceedings of the biannual participatory design conference shows that ethnography is becoming an increasingly widespread technique in work-oriented design. This paper (1) explicates the rationale behind participatory designs turn to ethnography; (2) identifies central problems with the techniques employment from participatory designs point of view; (3) presents methodological solutions developed in the course of designing a prototype supporting the work activities of some 2500 potential end-users distributed in over 250 offices around the world. Emphasis is placed on attention to working language as a reproducible means of getting hands-on work and organisation, particularly in large-scale settings.","authors":["Andy Crabtree"],"meta":["March 2001"],"references":["273337040_Work-Oriented_Design_of_Computer_Artifacts","243690944_Collective_Resources_Meets_Puritanism","242655308_The_Collective_Resource_Approach_The_Scandinavian_Experience","324308514_Plans_and_Situated_Actions_The_Problem_of_Human-Machine_Communication","256600139_Philosophical_Investigations_Oxford","252751208_Take_Users_Seriously_but_Take_a_Deeper_Look","248440628_Why_Groupware_Applications_Fail","247290327_Prototyping_A_Methodological_Assessment","243783044_Computers_and_Design_in_Context","242505799_Computers_and_Democracy_-_A_Scandinavian_Challenge"]}
