{"id":"225173082_Quantum_Partial_Search_of_a_Database_with_Several_Target_Items","abstract":"We consider unstructured database separated into blocks of equal size. Blocks containing target items are called target blocks.\nBlocks without target items are called non-target blocks. We present a fast quantum algorithm, which finds one of the target\nblocks. The algorithm uses the same oracle, which the main Grover algorithm does. We study the simplest case, when each target\nblock has the same number of target items. Our algorithm is based on Boyer, Brassard, Hoyer, and Tapp algorithm of searching\ndatabase with several target items and on Groverâ€“Radhakrishnan algorithm of partial search. We minimize the number of queries\nto the oracle. We analyze the algorithm for blocks of large size. In next publications we shall consider more general case\nwhen the number of target items is different in different target blocks.","authors":["Byung-Soo Choi","Vladimir E.
