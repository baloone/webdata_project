{"id":"338576618_PSO-DEC_PSO_based_deterministic_energy_efficient_clustering_protocol_for_IoT","abstract":"Deterministic Energy-efficient Clustering protocol (DEC) is a dynamic, distributive and self-organized method to decrease the energy depletion in the network. DEC protocol promises to a better and fixed number of Cluster Heads (CH) selections based on the remaining energy in its every round. DEC has various demerits like non-consideration of intra-cluster distance, disregard of the degree of the node. To address these issues of DEC, this paper proposes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Deterministic Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol, PSO-DEC. In this work, K-means clustering is used for initially clustering on the heterogeneous network and hybrid PSO-DEC is used for CH selection. MATLAB based recreation output shows that PSO-DEC outwits on conventional DEC and improved the lifetime of the network. The performance matrices are evaluated and calculated results indicate a significant improvement over the conventional protocols.","authors":["Indu Dohare","Karan Singh"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences and Cryptography 22(8):1463-1475","DOI:10.1080/09720529.2019.1695898"],"references":["336320085_Energy_efficient_data_collection_with_multiple_mobile_sink_using_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_in_large-scale_WSN","320956809_Optimal_Operational_Parameters_for_5G_Energy_Harvesting_Cognitive_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","320231458_hetSEP_Heterogeneous_SEP_protocol_for_increasing_lifetime_in_WSNs","303868911_PRP_Peripheral_Routing_Protocol_for_WSN_Realistic_Marginal_Mobility_Model","301363281_A_particle_swarm_optimization_based_energy_efficient_cluster_head_selection_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","262490549_Energy_efficient_clustering_and_routing_algorithms_for_wireless_sensor_networks_Particle_swarm_optimization_approach","228885310_SEP_A_Stable_Election_Protocol_for_Clustered_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224882024_A_deterministic_energy-efficient_clustering_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","224159078_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_in_Wireless-Sensor_Networks_A_Brief_Survey","335374550_An_efficient_tree-based_clone_detection_scheme_in_wireless_sensor_network","334038874_Comparative_study_of_clustering_algorithms_for_MANETs","327912413_Network_security_of_low_power_wireless_router_based_on_clustering_routing_algorithm","315934794_New_secure_routing_protocol_with_elliptic_curve_cryptography_for_military_heterogeneous_wireless_sensor_networks","312108843_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_microsensor_networks","285480574_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","282072065_Particle_swarm_optimization_protocol_for_clustering_in_wireless_sensor_networks_A_realistic_approach","281415121_Bat_Algorithm_A_Survey_of_the_State-of-the-Art","279170160_Genetic-IDGKA_Genetic_ID-Based_Group_Key_Agreement_Protocol_for_Large_MANETs","271753254_Power_saving_by_incorporating_mobile_agents_and_clustering_approach_in_wireless_sensor_networks","265497336_A_novel_NP-based_security_scheme_for_AODV_routing_protocol","3968599_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","2936392_HEED_A_Hybrid_Energy-Efficient_Distributed_Clustering_Approach_for_Ad-hoc_Sensor_Networks"]}
