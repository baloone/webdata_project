{"id":"323635642_Metadata_for_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_-_The_Case_of_Folk_Dances","abstract":"It is a fact that states and international organizations are trying to protect and promote intangible cultural\nheritage. According to UNESCO intangible cultural heritage includes traditions or living expressions\ninherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants. Folk dances are an important part of our\nintangible cultural heritage, so there is a need to promote and protect them to inherit to the next generations.\nBeyond digitization of various elements of the dance, proper documentation requires to analyse them (either\nmanually or automatically) and describe all important elements using appropriate metadata. However,\nalthough different metadata schemas have been defined in the area of cultural heritage, most are suitable only\nfor tangible heritage, and cannot properly describe elements of intangible cultural heritage. The present study\nproposes a new metadata schema for describing different elements of folk dance.","authors":["Stamatios Giannoulakis","Nicolas Tsapatsoulis","Grammalidis Nikos"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.5220/0006760906340645","Conference: Special Session on Visual Computing in Engineering Applications","Project: Image Retrieval"],"references":["317588758_BalOnSe_Temporal_Aspects_of_Dance_Movement_and_Its_Ontological_Representation","316478165_Modelling_of_Static_and_Moving_Objects_Digitizing_Tangible_and_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage","315857532_Transforming_Intangible_Folkloric_Performing_Arts_into_Tangible_Choreographic_Digital_Objects_The_Terpsichore_Approach","312383903_UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Management_on_the_web","282526797_The_pros_and_cons_about_the_digital_recording_of_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_and_some_strategies","304823435_Handbook_of_Metadata_Semantics_and_Ontologies","290441240_Forthcoming_2016_Beyond_Binarism_Exploring_a_Model_of_Living_Cultural_Heritage_for_Dance","283379474_Intangible_cultural_heritage_of_dance_as_medium_for_intercultural_dialogue_culture_assimilator_reinterpreted","281066120_An_Intellectual_Journey_in_History_Preserving_Indian_Cultural_Heritage","278849612_The_Anthropology_of_Dance"]}
