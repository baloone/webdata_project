{"id":"291783635_A_Generalized_Threshold_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Path_Problem_with_Time_Windows","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new labeling algorithm for the shortest path problem with time windows (SPPTW). It is generalized from the threshold algorithm for the unconstrained shortest path prob-lem. Our computational experiments show that this generalized thresh-old algorithm outperforms a label setting algorithm for the SPPTW on a set of randomly generated test problems. The average running time of the new algorithm is about 40% less than the label setting algorithm, which i s t o d a y the best algorithm based on published experimental ev-idence.","authors":["Warren B.
