{"id":"264001734_Proposta_Brasileira_de_Metadados_para_Objetos_de_Aprendizagem_Baseados_em_Agentes_OBAA","abstract":"This paper presents the Agent Based Learning Objects -OBAA standard proposal. The main goal of the research was to establish a standardized specification of the technical and functional requirements of learning objects that should allow the interoperability of the contents between Web and Digital TV environment, supporting accessibility and pedagogical issues. In this proposal it has been explored the convergence among the multiagent systems, LO and ubiquitous computing technologies, allowing the authoring, storage and recovery of LO in varied contexts and through different digital platforms. The result of this research was the definition of the OBAA proposal containing the requirements, specifications and architectures that will compose the Brazilian standard for the management, transmission, storage, search, editing and use of LO that can be distributed and used in an integrated manner within the Web platforms, mobile devices and Digital TV.","authors":["Rosa Maria Vicari","Marta Bez","Patricia Alejandra Behar","JÃºlia Marques Carvalho da Silva"],"meta":["August 2010"],"references":["236669555_Proposta_de_Padrao_para_Metadados_de_Objetos_de_Aprendizagem_Multiplataforma","333272938_Uma_proposta_de_padrao_de_metadados_para_objetos_de_aprendizagem_de_museus_de_ciencia_e_tecnologia","313241423_Connecting_learning_objects_to_instructional_design_theory_A_definition_a_metaphor_and_a_taxonomy","262156730_The_Semantic_Web"]}
