{"id":"333546372_Balanced_Odd-Variable_RSBFs_with_Optimum_AI_High_Nonlinearity_and_Good_Behavior_against_FAAs","abstract":"Rotation symmetric Boolean functions which are invariant under the action of cyclic group have been used in many different cryptosystems. This paper presents a new construction of balanced odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity. It is checked that, at least for some small variables, such functions have very good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. Compared with some known rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity, the new construction has really better nonlinearity. Further, the algebraic degree of the constructed functions is also high enough.","authors":["Yindong Chen","Fei GUO","Hongyan XIANG","Weihong CAI"],"meta":["June 2019IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics Communications and Computer Sciences E102.A(6):818-824","DOI:10.1587/transfun.E102.A.818"],"references":["235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","224242489_Balanced_rotation_symmetric_boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","221327270_An_Infinite_Class_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_Good_Immunity_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Good_Nonlinearity","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","220334098_A_Conjecture_on_Binary_String_and_Its_Applications_on_Constructing_Boolean_Functions_of_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","45880277_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","3085927_Algebraic_immunity_for_cryptographically_significant_Boolean_functions_Analysis_and_construction","303878694_Construction_of_odd-Variable_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","262246788_On_the_Resistance_of_Boolean_Functions_against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","257554710_Construction_of_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_high_nonlinearity","251602363_Balanced_2_p_-variable_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","242518319_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_optimal","223319299_Rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions-Count_and_cryptographic_properties","220681072_Two_Classes_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimum_Algebraic_Immunity_Construction_and_Analysis","220334165_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity_on_Odd_Number_of_Variables","220333689_Tight_bound_between_nonlinearity_and_algebraic_immunity"]}
