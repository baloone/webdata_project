{"id":"325011491_Harmonic_Index_and_its_Generalizations_Extremal_Results_and_Bounds","abstract":"The general sum--connectivity index $\\chi_\\alpha$ of a graph $G$ is defined as\n$\\chi_\\alpha(G)=\\sum_{uv\\in E(G)}(d_{u}+d_{v})^{\\alpha}$, where $uv$ is the edge connecting the vertices $u$ and $v$, $d_{u}$ is the degree of the vertex $u$, and $\\alpha$ is a real number. Research on $\\chi_{\\alpha}$ began in 1972,\nwhen the first Zagreb index $\\chi_{1}$ was introduced within a study of total $\\pi$-electron energy. Later, in 1987, the harmonic index $H$($=2\\chi_{-1}$) appeared in connection with some conjectures, generated by the computer program Graffiti. The\nsum--connectivity index $\\chi_{-1/2}$, was proposed in 2009 and eventually extended to the general sum--connectivity index $\\chi_{\\alpha}$, which not only includes all the\naforementioned graph invariants but also the hyper-Zagreb index $\\chi_{2}$. In this survey, we outline the extremal results and bounds involving the mentioned invariants.","authors":["Akbar Ali","Lingping Zhong","Ivan Gutman"],"meta":["March 2019MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 81(2):249-311"],"references":["331686347_Solution_to_the_minimum_harmonic_index_of_graphs_with_given_minimum_degree","327149772_Vertex-weighted_Wiener_polynomials_for_composite_graphs","324246589_New_Bounds_on_the_Hyper-Zagreb_index_for_the_simple_connected_graphs","323253042_On_bounds_for_harmonic_topological_index","322853722_Zagreb_energy_and_Zagreb_Estrada_index_of_graphs","340662990_Trees_with_a_given_order_and_matching_number_that_have_maximum_general_sum-connectivity_index","325872554_Further_Results_On_Harmonic_Index_And_Some_New_Relations_Between_Harmonic_Index_And_Other_Topological_Indices","325795945_The_harmonic_index_of_edge-semitotal_graphs_total_graphs_and_related_sums","324129005_Ordering_chemical_graphs_by_Randic_and_sum-connectivity_numbers","322853479_Some_inequalities_for_general_sum-connectivity_index"]}
