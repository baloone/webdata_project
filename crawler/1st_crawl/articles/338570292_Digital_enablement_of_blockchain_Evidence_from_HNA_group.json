However, extant discussions are mostly conceptual expositions, and empirical evidence of how to use the technology is limited. This case analysis fills this gap by conducting a study on Hainan Airlines (HNA) group, a large conglomerate, which has successfully implemented a blockchain-enabled E-commerce platform to offer employees flexible benefits.
