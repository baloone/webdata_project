{"id":"259875346_How_are_excellent_highly_cited_papers_defined_in_bibliometrics_A_quantitative_analysis_of_the_literature","abstract":"As the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention (in\nscience policy) over the last few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric\nstudies have been published dealing with excellent papers. However, many\ndifferent methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers.\nThe present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in\norder to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an \"average\"\nor \"most frequent\" bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science\nyielded 321 papers dealing with \"highly cited\", \"most cited\", \"top cited\" and\n\"most frequently cited\". Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study.\nIn around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition\nhas been provided with which to identify excellent papers. With definitions\nwhich relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers\n(58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Around\n23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an\narithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3%\n(median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top\n10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be\npossible to identify excellent papers based on an \"average\" or \"most frequent\"\npractice among bibliometricians.","authors":["Lutz Bornmann"],"meta":["January 2014Research Evaluation 23(2)","DOI:10.1093/reseval/rvu002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257692368_Family-tree_of_bibliometric_indices","240805059_Characteristics_of_highly_cited_papers","235521593_How_good_is_research_really-Measuring_the_citation_impact_of_publications_with_percentiles_increases_correct_assessments_and_fair_comparisons","270757897_Beyond_Signifcance_Testing_Reforming_Data_Analysis_Methods_in_Behavioral_Research","264933916_Categorical_Data_Analysis_2nd_Edn","257692147_The_case_of_scientometricians_with_the_absolute_relative_impact_indicator","257662878_Citation_time_window_choice_for_research_impact_evaluation","242916337_Relation_of_seminal_nanotechnology_document_production_to_total_nanotechnology_document_production_-_South_Korea","242915768_Some_facts_and_figures_on_highly_cited_papers_in_the_sciences_1981-1985","239731773_Which_percentile-based_approach_should_be_preferred_for_calculating_normalized_citation_impact_values_An_empirical_comparison_of_five_approaches_including_a_newly_developed_citation-rank_approach_P100"]}
