{"id":"268200900_Universality_in_Elementary_Cellular_Automata","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to prove a conjecture made by Stephen Wolfram in 1985, that an elementary one dimensional cellular automaton known as \"Rule 110\" is capable of universal computation. I developed this proof of his conjecture while assisting Stephen Wolfram on research for A New Kind of Science [1].","authors":["Matthew Cook"],"meta":["January 2004Complex Systems 15(1)"],"references":[]}
