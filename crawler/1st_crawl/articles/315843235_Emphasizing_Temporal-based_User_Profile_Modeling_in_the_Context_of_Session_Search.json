{"id":"315843235_Emphasizing_Temporal-based_User_Profile_Modeling_in_the_Context_of_Session_Search","abstract":"In this paper, we aim at modeling the user proﬁle containing timely relevant information extracted from his interactions with search engines. We considered a time-sensitive user proﬁle that provides relevant and fresh information inferred from his submitted queries, reformulated queries and clicked results. We used a unique proﬁle that integrates current and recurrent interactions within a session giving more importance to recent interactions without ignoring the old ones. We conducted experiments using the 2013 TREC Session track and the ClueWeb12 collection that showed the eﬀectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art ones.","authors":["Ameni Kacem Sahraoui","Mohand Boughanem","Rim Faiz"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1145/3019612.3019693","Conference: ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2017At: Marrakech, Morocco","Projects: Temporal User Profiling for Personalized IRLeveraging big data for event detection in micro blogs"],"references":["278661671_Time-Sensitive_User_Profile_for_Optimizing_Search_Personlization","234781445_The_query-flow_graph_Model_and_applications","222677862_Real_Life_Real_Users_and_Real_Needs_A_Study_and_Analysis_of_User_Queries_on_the_Web","311100394_An_axiomatic_approach_for_result_diversification","282261176_On_Duplicate_Results_in_a_Search_Session","262349484_Query_change_as_relevance_feedback_in_session_search","262159043_Utilizing_query_change_for_session_search","254464593_Time_drives_interaction_Simulating_sessions_in_diverse_searching_environments","234828904_Novelty_and_diversity_in_information_retrieval_evaluation","227687870_Analysis_and_Evaluation_of_Query_Reformulations_in_Different_Task_Types"]}
