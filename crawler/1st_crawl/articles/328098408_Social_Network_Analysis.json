{"id":"328098408_Social_Network_Analysis","abstract":"From some basic considerations of formation of dyadic [pair-wise] binary [go/no-go] relations among a given number of units [individuals/households etc], we develop a social network. Basic parameters are then introduced and their quantifications are made for a given population network. Then a sampling problem is considered for formation of a sample network. Estimation of the population parameters based on data arising from a sample network are then discussed in details.","authors":["Shyama PRASAD Mukherjee","Bikas K.
