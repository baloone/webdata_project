{"id":"221498815_The_Monotone_Complexity_of_k-Clique_on_Random_Graphs","abstract":"It is widely suspected that Erdos-Renyi random graphs are a source of hard instances for clique problems. Giving further evidence for this belief, we prove the first average-case hardness result for the k-clique problem on monotone circuits. Specifically, we show that no monotone circuit of size O (n(k/4)) solves the k-clique problem with high probability on G(n, p) for two sufficiently far-apart threshold functions p(n) (for instance n(-2/(k-1)) and 2n(-2/(k-1))). Moreover, the exponent k/4 in this result is tight up to an additive constant. One technical contribution of this paper is the introduction of quasi-sunflowers, a new relaxation of sunflowers in which petals may overlap slightly on average. A \"quasi-sunflower lemma\" (a la the Erdos-Rado sunflower lemma) leads to our novel lower bounds within Razborov's method of approximations.","authors":["Benjamin Rossman"],"meta":["October 2010Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on 43(1):193-201","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2010.26","SourceDBLP","Conference: 51th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS 2010, October 23-26, 2010, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA"],"references":["220442073_The_monotone_circuit_complexity_of_Boolean_functions","2342664_Hiding_Cliques_for_Cryptographic_Security","313061622_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph_algorithm_457","268496537_Random_Graphs","268247843_On_the_complexity_of_the_subgraph_problem","243733877_Intersection_Theorems_for_Systems_of_Sets","242918556_k_-Subgraph_Isomorphism_on_AC_0_Circuits","242637127_Lower_bounds_on_the_monotone_complexity_of_some_Boolean_functions","240462812_A_simple_lower_bound_for_the_depth_of_monotone_circuits_computing_clique_using_a_communication_game","239725822_Probabilistic_analysis_of_some_combinatorial_search_problems","231763462_Threshold_functions_for_small_subgraphs","228057698_Color-Coding","222475748_A_simple_lower_bound_for_monotone_clique_using_a_communication_game","221590941_On_the_constant-depth_complexity_of_k-clique","221590779_On_the_Method_of_Approximations","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220689472_Extremal_combinatorics_With_applications_in_computer_science","220616816_The_Potential_of_the_Approximation_Method","220570139_Lower_bounds_for_recognizing_small_cliques_on_CRCW_PRAM's","220423131_Finding_All_Cliques_of_an_Undirected_Graph","220345595_Poisson_Approximation_for_Large_Deviations","3635354_Counting_bottlenecks_to_show_monotone_PNP","2645763_Higher_Lower_Bounds_On_Monotone_Size","2631399_Almost_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Small_Depth_Circuits","2629668_A_Superpolynomial_Lower_Bound_for_a_Circuit_Computing_the_Clique_Function_with_at_most_16_log_log_n_Negation_Gates","2408432_Finding_a_Large_Hidden_Clique_in_a_Random_Graph"]}
