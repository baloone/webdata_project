{"id":"316529434_Foundations_of_logic_programming_in_hybrid_logics_with_user-defined_sharing","abstract":"The present contribution advances an abstract notion of hybrid logic by supplementing the definition of institution with an additional structure to extract frames. The foundation of logic programming is set in the general framework proposed by defining the basic concepts such as Horn clause, query and solution, and proving fundamental results such as the existence of initial model of Horn clauses and Herbrand's theorem. The abstract results are then applied to hybrid logics with user-defined sharing, where the possible worlds share a common domain and the variables used for quantification are interpreted uniformly across the worlds.","authors":["Daniel Găină"],"meta":["April 2017Theoretical Computer Science 686(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.04.009","Project: Mathematical structures for developing reconfigurable software systems"],"references":["292461721_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming_in_Hybridised_Logics","282175488_From_conventional_to_institution-independent_logic_programming","276384653_Downward_Lowenheim-Skolem_Theorem_and_interpolation_in_logics_with_constructors","274151032_Quasi-varieties_and_initial_semantics_for_hybridized_institutions","303439307_A_method_for_rigorous_design_of_reconfigurable_systems","301846899_Implicit_Kripke_Semantics_and_Ultraproducts_in_Stratified_Institutions","298329599_Proof_theory_for_hybridised_logics","280721389_Encoding_hybridized_institutions_into_first-order_logic","269723210_Refinement_in_hybridised_institutions","266992696_Universal_logic_An_anthology_From_Paul_Hertz_to_Dov_Gabbay"]}
