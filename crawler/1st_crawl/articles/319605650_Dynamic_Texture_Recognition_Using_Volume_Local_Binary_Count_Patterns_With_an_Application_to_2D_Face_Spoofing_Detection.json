{"id":"319605650_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Volume_Local_Binary_Count_Patterns_With_an_Application_to_2D_Face_Spoofing_Detection","abstract":"In this paper, a local spatio-temporal descriptor, namely, volume local binary count (VLBC), is proposed for the representation and recognition of dynamic texture. This descriptor, which is similar in spirit to volume local binary pattern (VLBP), extracts histograms of thresholded local spatio-temporal volumes using both appearance and motion features to describe dynamic texture. Unlike VLBP using binary encoding, VLBC does not exploit the local structure information and only counts the number of 1s in the thresholded codes. Thus, VLBC can include more neighboring pixels without exponentially increasing the feature dimension as VLBP does. Furthermore, a completed version of VLBC (CVLBC) is also proposed to enhance the performance of dynamic texture recognition with additional information about local contrast and central pixel intensities. The proposed method is not only efficient to compute but also effective for dynamic texture representation. In experiments with three dynamic texture databases, namely, UCLA, DynTex and DynTex++, the proposed method produces classification rates that are comparable to those produced by the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to dynamic texture recognition, we propose utilizing CVLBC for 2D face spoofing detection. As an effective spatio-temporal descriptor, CVLBC can well describe the differences between facial videos of valid users and impostors, thus achieving good performance for face spoofing detection. For comparison with other methods, the proposed method is evaluated on three face anti-spoofing databases: Print-Attack, Replay-Attack and CAS Face Anti-Spoofing. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CVLBC for 2D face spoofing detection.","authors":["Xiaochao Zhao","Yaping Lin","Janne Heikkila"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Transactions on Multimedia PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMM.2017.2750415"],"references":["313910272_Synthesising_Dynamic_Textures_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","310757881_Not_all_frames_are_equal_aggregating_salient_features_for_dynamic_texture_classification","301842292_Texture_Networks_Feed-forward_Synthesis_of_Textures_and_Stylized_Images","301571761_Face_Spoofing_Detection_Using_Colour_Texture_Analysis","286690809_Face_Anti-spoofing_Based_on_General_Image_Quality_Assessment","273668870_Face_liveness_detection_using_dynamic_texture","273640906_Detection_of_Face_Spoofing_Using_Visual_Dynamics","271269865_Face_Spoof_Detection_With_Image_Distortion_Analysis","266676858_Deep_Representations_for_Iris_Face_and_Fingerprint_Spoofing_Attack_Detection","263813576_Optimizing_LBP_Structure_For_Visual_Recognition_Using_Binary_Quadratic_Programming","262405100_Face_Liveness_Detection_from_a_Single_Image_with_Sparse_Low_Rank_Bilinear_Discriminative_Model","239525845_Complementary_countermeasures_for_detecting_scenic_face_spoofing_attacks","230775873_On_the_Effectiveness_of_Local_Binary_Patterns_in_Face_Anti-spoofing","311978037_Dynamic_Texture_Representation_Using_a_Deep_Multi-Scale_Convolutional_Network","311611053_Equiangular_Kernel_Dictionary_Learning_with_Applications_to_Dynamic_Texture_Analysis","311344466_Learning_spatiotemporal_features_with_3d_convolutional_networks","310845419_Privacy_preserving_crowd_monitoring_Counting_people_without_people_models_or_tracking","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","307515846_FACE_spoofing_detection_using_LDP-TOP","306922527_Image_Classification_by_Cross-Media_Active_Learning_With_Privileged_Information","305183742_Deep_filter_banks_for_texture_recognition_and_segmentation","303156337_The_2nd_competition_on_counter_measures_to_2D_face_spoofing_attacks","301761593_A_novel_scheme_based_on_local_binary_pattern_for_dynamic_texture_recognition","300412827_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_via_Orthogonal_Tensor_Dictionary_Learning","300408292_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_with_3D_Convolutional_Networks","291422285_A_Novel_Lip_Descriptor_for_Audio-Visual_Keyword_Spotting_Based_on_Adaptive_Decision_Fusion","284568120_Modeling_Video_Dynamics_with_Deep_Dynencoder","282544306_Face_Spoofing_Detection_Based_on_Multiple_Descriptor_Fusion_Using_Multiscale_Dynamic_Binarized_Statistical_Image_Features","273793060_Person-Specific_Face_Antispoofing_With_Subject_Domain_Adaptation","273579363_Dynamic_texture_based_smoke_detection_using_Surfacelet_transform_and_HMT_model","273528138_Dynamic_texture_recognition_based_on_completed_volume_local_binary_pattern","273395769_Discriminative_Non-Linear_Stationary_Subspace_Analysis_for_Video_Classification","273393002_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition_Using_Multiscale_Binarized_Statistical_Image_Features","273308875_Spatiotemporal_Directional_Number_Transitional_Graph_for_Dynamic_Texture_Recognition","272385831_On_the_Use_of_Client_Identity_Information_for_Face_Antispoofing","272102392_Exploiting_high_level_feature_for_dynamic_textures_recognition","271771514_Dynamic_texture_and_scene_classification_by_transferring_deep_image_features","262316793_LBP_-_TOP_Based_Countermeasure_against_Face_Spoofing_Attacks","262207764_Texture_databases_-_A_comprehensive_survey","261314603_Dynamic_texture_recognition_using_enhanced_LBP_features","261154773_Spatiotemporal_stereo_via_spatiotemporal_quadric_element_stequel_matching","261046224_A_face_antispoofing_database_with_diverse_attacks","260836927_Similarity_Assessment_Model_for_Chinese_Sign_Language_Videos","260551425_Computationally_Efficient_Face_Spoofing_Detection_with_Motion_Magnification","258499814_Describing_Textures_in_the_Wild","257789145_The_2nd_competition_on_counter_measures_to_2D_face_spoofing_attacks","257484783_Scale-space_texture_description_on_SIFT-like_textons","250267317_Live_Face_Detection_Based_on_the_Analysis_of_Fourier_Spectra","234553502_Studies_in_Optics","230713633_Wavelet_Domain_Multifractal_Analysis_for_Static_and_Dynamic_Texture_Classification","228852048_Face_spoofing_detection_from_single_images_using_micro-texture_analysis","228851871_Counter-Measures_to_Photo_Attacks_in_Face_Recognition_a_public_database_and_a_baseline","224692659_Texture_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","224579864_Lipreading_With_Local_Spatiotemporal_Descriptors","227343637_Completed_Local_Binary_Count_for_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification"]}
