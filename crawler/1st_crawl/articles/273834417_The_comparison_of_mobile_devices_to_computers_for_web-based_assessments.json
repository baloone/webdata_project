{"id":"273834417_The_comparison_of_mobile_devices_to_computers_for_web-based_assessments","abstract":"This research investigated the completing of a web-based personality assessment using smart phones and computers. Data were collected from 47 undergraduate students using a within subjects design. Results indicated that the usability and the time to complete the assessment of a web-based non-optimized questionnaire is significantly different when completed with a smart phone versus a computer. However, there were no significant differences in personality scores.","authors":["Kyle Huff"],"meta":["August 2015Computers in Human Behavior 49","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.008"],"references":["287100109_Web-Based_Testing_Exploring_The_Relationship_Between_Hardware_Usability_And_Test_Performance","248940593_Effects_of_Screen_Size_Screen_Resolution_and_Display_Rate_on_Computer-Based_Test_Performance","247720604_Are_Internet_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Personality_Tests_Truly_Comparable","232485286_Equivalence_of_Computerized_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Cognitive_Ability_Tests_A_Meta-Analysis","225280296_Testing_Reasoning_Ability_with_Handheld_Computers_Notebooks_and_Paper_and_Pencil","220496175_Turning_to_learn_Screen_orientation_and_reasoning_with_small_devices","7014171_The_Mini-IPIP_Scales_Tiny-yet-Effective_Measures_of_the_Big_Five_Factors_of_Personality","272178075_How_Working_Memory_Capacity_Affects_Problem_Solving","271652718_Internet-Based_Unproctored_Assessments_on_Mobile_and_Non-Mobile_Devices_Usage_Measurement_Equivalence_and_Outcomes","261842245_Establishing_the_Measurement_Equivalence_of_Online_Selection_Assessments_Delivered_on_Mobile_versus_Nonmobile_Devices","261842244_The_Use_of_Mobile_Devices_in_High-stakes_Remotely_Delivered_Assessments_and_Testing","240237192_The_Mode_Effect_A_Literature_Review_of_Human_and_Technological_Issues_in_Computerized_Testing","235904595_Examination_of_the_equivalence_of_self-report_survey-based_paper-and-pencil_and_Internet_data_collection_methods","229734084_Web-based_and_paper-and-pencil_testing_of_applicants_in_a_proctored_setting_Are_personality_biodata_and_situational_judgment_tests_comparable","223847121_The_effect_of_page_layout_on_mental_workload_A_dual-task_experiment","220496201_Computer-based_tests_the_impact_of_test_design_and_problem_of_equivalency","220495843_Internet_testing_Equivalence_between_proctored_lab_and_unproctored_field_conditions","220140072_Character_size_and_reading_to_remember_from_small_displays","200085994_IBM_Computer_Usability_Satisfaction_Questionnaires_Psychometric_Evaluation_and_Instructions_for_Use"]}
