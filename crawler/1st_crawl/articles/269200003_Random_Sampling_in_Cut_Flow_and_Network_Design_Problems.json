{"id":"269200003_Random_Sampling_in_Cut_Flow_and_Network_Design_Problems","abstract":"Random sampling is used as a tool for solving undirected graph problems. It is shown that the sparse graph, or skeleton, that arises when sampling a graph's edges, will accurately approximate the value of all cuts in the original graph with high probability. Fast randomized algorithms for approximating and exactly finding minimum cuts and maximum flows in unweighted, undirected graphs are also presented.","authors":["David Ron Karger"],"meta":["January 1994Mathematics of Operations Research 24(2):648-657","DOI:10.1145/195058.195422","Conference: the twenty-sixth annual ACM symposium"],"references":["262282478_An_On_2_algorithm_for_minimum_cuts","228057871_Well-balanced_Orientations_of_Finite_Graphs_and_Unobtrusive_Odd-vertex-pairings","228057801_Efficient_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Testing_Connectivity_and_Finding_Disjoint_s-t_Paths_in_Graphs","220779035_A_Linear_Time_2epsilon_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Edge_Connectivity"]}
