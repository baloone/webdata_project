{"id":"220266616_Randomized_Postoptimization_of_Covering_Arrays","abstract":"The construction of covering arrays with the fewest rows remains a challenging problem. Most computational and recursive constructions\nresult in extensive repetition of coverage. While some is necessary, some is not. By reducing the repeated coverage, metaheuristic\nsearch techniques typically outperform simpler computational methods, but they have been applied in a limited set of cases.\nTime constraints often prevent them from finding an array of competitive size. We examine a different approach. Having used\na simple computation or construction to find a covering array, we employ a postoptimization technique that repeatedly adjusts\nthe array in order to (sometimes) reduce its number of rows. At every stage the array retains full coverage. We demonstrate\nits value on a collection of previously best known arrays by eliminating, in some cases, 10% of their rows. In the well-studied\ncase of strength two with twenty factors having ten values each, postoptimization produces a covering array with only 162\nrows, improving on a wide variety of computational and combinatorial methods. We identify certain important features of covering\narrays for which postoptimization is successful.","authors":["Peyman Nayeri","Charles J.
