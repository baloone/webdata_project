{"id":"354568196_Branching_structures_emerging_from_a_continuous_optimal_transport_model","abstract":"Recently a Dynamic-Monge-Kantorovich formulation of the PDE-based -optimal transport problem was presented. The model considers a diffusion equation enforcing the balance of the transported masses with a time-varying conductivity that evolves proportionally to the transported flux. In this paper we present an extension of this model that considers a time derivative of the conductivity that grows as a power-law of the transport flux with exponent β>0. A sub-linear growth (0<β<1) penalizes the flux intensity and promotes distributed transport, with equilibrium solutions that are reminiscent of Congested Transport Problems. On the contrary, a super-linear growth (β>1) favors flux intensity and promotes concentrated transport, leading to the emergence of steady-state “singular” and “fractal-like” configurations that resemble those of Branched Transport Problems. We derive a numerical discretization of the proposed model that is accurate, efficient, and robust for a wide range of scenarios. For β>1 the numerical model is able to reproduce highly irregular and fractal-like formations without any a-priory structural assumption.","authors":["Enrico Facca","Franco Cardin","Mario Putti"],"meta":["September 2021Journal of Computational Physics 447(2):110700","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110700"],"references":["337802464_A_mesoscopic_model_of_biological_transportation_networks","320554856_Spectral_preconditioners_for_the_efficient_numerical_solution_of_a_continuous_branched_transport_model","319952803_Numerical_Solution_of_Monge-Kantorovich_Equations_via_a_Dynamic_Formulation","309317270_Towards_a_Stationary_Monge--Kantorovich_Dynamics_The_Physarum_Polycephalum_Experience","262994983_Mathematical_Analysis_of_a_PDE_System_for_Biological_Network_Formation","260254068_Form_function_and_evolution_of_living_organisms","260253929_Evolution_and_selection_of_river_networks_Statics_dynamics_and_complexity","257749790_Adaptation_and_Optimization_of_Biological_Transport_Networks","252836492_Finite_Element_Approximation_of_the_p-Laplacian","29605672_An_Optimization_Problem_for_Mass_Transportation_with_Congested_Dynamics","319501540_A_fractal_shape_optimization_problem_in_branched_transport","314236653_Progress_in_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_and_Their_Applications","277574162_Augmented_Lagrangian_Methods_for_Transport_Optimization_Mean_Field_Games_and_Degenerate_Elliptic_Equations","276419403_Motivations_ideas_and_applications_of_ramified_optimal_transportation","266997789_On_landscape_functions_associated_with_transport_paths","261857045_A_Continuous_Model_of_Transportation_Revisited","260365821_Sur_l'approximation_par_elements_finis_d'ordre_un_et_la_resolution_par_penalisation-dualite_d'une_classe_de_problemes_de_Dirichlet_non_lineaires","245916589_Dieren_tial_Equations_Methods_for_the_MongeKantorovich_Mass_Transfer_Problem","228562083_Optimal_paths_related_to_transport_problems","225658296_A_Modica-Mortola_Approximation_for_Branched_Transport_and_Applications","222844362_MathematiquesMathematics_Shape_optimization_solutions_via_Monge-Kantorovich_equation","215618087_Convex_Analysis_and_Variational_Problems","45872879_A_Modica-Mortola_approximation_for_branched_transport","12962585_Size_and_form_in_efficient_transportation_networks","6726232_A_mathematical_model_for_adaptive_transport_network_in_path_finding_by_true_slime_mold","1777687_RETRACTED_ARTICLE_Numerical_simulation_of_optimal_transport_paths"]}
