{"id":"282749000_The_distribution_free_newsboy_problem_with_balking","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to study the classic newsboy model with more realistic assumptions. First, we allow customers to balk when inventory level is low. Secondly, we relax the assumption that the cumulative distribution function of the demand is completely known and merely assume that the first two moments of the distribution function are known.","authors":["Ilkyeong Moon","Sangjin Choi"],"meta":["January 1995Journal of the Operational Research Society 46(4):537-542","DOI:10.1038/sj/jors/0460413"],"references":[]}
