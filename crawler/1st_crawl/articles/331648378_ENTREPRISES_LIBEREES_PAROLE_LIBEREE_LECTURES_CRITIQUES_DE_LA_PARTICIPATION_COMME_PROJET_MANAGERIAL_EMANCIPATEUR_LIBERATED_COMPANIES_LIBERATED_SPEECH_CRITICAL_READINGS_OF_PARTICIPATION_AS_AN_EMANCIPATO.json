The thesis is focused on two cases of so-called « liberated » companies, which are supposed to illustrate the economic and humanistic successes that result from opening up discussion of working and organizing issues (« liberating speech ») and from breaking from authoritarian and hierarchical relations (« liberating structures »). The thesis questions the effects of such dispositives and practices of organizational members, at the individual and collective levels. In doing so, the thesis draws from two distinct theoretical frames : the communicational theory of Jürgen Habermas; and the organizational psychoanalysis, specifically in reference to the thought of Jacques Lacan. The thesis contributes to the critical debates over employee participation, in contemporary contexts in which a « post-authoritarian » turn in more clearly affirmed. The thesis highlights the « darker sides » of emancipatory ideologies in contemporary management.We put forward some prerequisites to sustaining open speech that makes room for the subject, as rational actor as well as « divided » subject whose inconscious desire should be respected. \n\nKeywords : Participation, Speech, Subjects, Emancipation, Management, Habermas, Lacan, Vasse, Liberated companies","authors":["Hélène Picard"],"meta":["December 2015","Thesis for: PhD in Management Science, Université Paris-Dauphine (PSL University)Advisor: Françoise Dany","Project: Liberation management / Neo-participative organizations"],"references":[]}
