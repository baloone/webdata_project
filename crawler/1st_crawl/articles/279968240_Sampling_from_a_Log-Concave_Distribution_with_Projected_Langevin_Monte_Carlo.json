{"id":"279968240_Sampling_from_a_Log-Concave_Distribution_with_Projected_Langevin_Monte_Carlo","abstract":"We extend the Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm to compactly supported\nmeasures via a projection step, akin to projected Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD). We show that (projected) LMC allows to sample in polynomial time from a\nlog-concave distribution with smooth potential. This gives a new Markov chain\nto sample from a log-concave distribution. Our main result shows in particular\nthat when the target distribution is uniform, LMC mixes in $\\tilde{O}(n^7)$\nsteps (where $n$ is the dimension). We also provide preliminary experimental\nevidence that LMC performs at least as well as hit-and-run, for which a better\nmixing time of $\\tilde{O}(n^4)$ was proved by Lov{\\'a}sz and Vempala.","authors":["SÃ©bastien Bubeck","Ronen Eldan","Joseph Lehec"],"meta":["June 2018Discrete & Computational Geometry 59(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-018-9992-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["329293696_Stochastic_differential_equations_with_reflecting_boundary_condition_in_convex_regions","324767808_Markov_Chains_and_Mixing_Times","300571536_Bypassing_KLS","279355808_Probability_in_Banach_Spaces","269997943_Theoretical_guarantees_for_approximate_sampling_from_smooth_and_log-concave_densities","265967000_Bypassing_KLS_Gaussian_Cooling_and_an_On3_Volume_Algorithm","248825285_A_random_polynomial_time_algorithm_for_estimating_volumes_of_convex_bodies","243772633_Probability_in_Banach_Spaces_Isoperimetry_and_Processes","243099303_Stochastic_Equations_for_Diffusion_Processes_in_a_Bounded_Region_II","243099237_Stochastic_Equations_for_Diffusion_Processes_in_a_Bounded_Region"]}
