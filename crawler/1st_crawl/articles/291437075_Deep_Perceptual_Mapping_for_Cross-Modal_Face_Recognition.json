{"id":"291437075_Deep_Perceptual_Mapping_for_Cross-Modal_Face_Recognition","abstract":"Cross modal face matching between the thermal and visible spectrum is a much\ndesired capability for night-time surveillance and security applications. Due\nto a very large modality gap, thermal-to-visible face recognition is one of the\nmost challenging face matching problem. In this paper, we present an approach\nto bridge this modality gap by a significant margin. Our approach captures the\nhighly non-linear relationship between the two modalities by using a deep\nneural network. Our model attempts to learn a non-linear mapping from visible\nto thermal spectrum while preserving the identity information. We show\nsubstantive performance improvement on three difficult thermal-visible face\ndatasets. The presented approach improves the state-of-the-art by more than\n10\\% on UND-X1 dataset and by more than 15-30\\% on NVESD dataset in terms of\nRank-1 identification. Our method bridges the drop in performance due to the\nmodality gap by more than 40\\%.","authors":["M.
