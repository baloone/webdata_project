{"id":"220638451_The_Theory_of_Cyclic_Codes_and_a_Generalization_to_Additive_Codes","abstract":"We present a new approach to the theory of cyclic and constacyclic codes and generalize the theory to cover the family of additive (not necessarily linear) cyclic codes. The approach is based on the action of the Galois group (cyclotomic cosets). The conventional representation of cyclic codes as ideals in a factor ring of the polynomial ring is not needed.","authors":["JÃ¼rgen Bierbrauer"],"meta":["February 2002Designs Codes and Cryptography 25(2):189-206","DOI:10.1023/A:1013808515797","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265352688_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","238360372_Topics_in_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","229763611_Direct_constructions_of_additive_codes","3079585_Subspace_subcodes_of_Reed-Solomon_codes","3078736_Subgroup_Subcodes","3077931_Some_ternary_and_quaternary_codes_and_associated_sphere_packings","2448508_Twisted_BCH-codes"]}
