{"id":"326026622_What_individual_and_organizational_competencies_facilitate_effective_collaboration_Findings_from_a_collaborative_governance_simulation","abstract":"This study seeks to elicit insights on the individual and organizational competencies associated with effective collaboration. Specifically, the authors gathered grounded insights on collaborative competencies from undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory public affairs course at a research-intensive, Midwestern university—following student participation in an interactive and replicable simulation designed according to Ansell and Gash’s “collaborative governance” framework. Results indicate that respondents associated being open-minded, strategic, respectful, an effective communicator, and patient with individual competencies; whereas compromise, teamwork, and trustworthiness were identified as organizational characteristics. Findings also highlight the educational value of simulations and related experiential- and active-learning techniques in elevating the knowledge, skills, abilities, and confidence of students in relation to practices integral to public service delivery, such as collaboration.","authors":["Cullen C.
