{"id":"351761169_Development_and_Validation_of_the_Win-Win_Scale","abstract":"Accumulating evidence has shown that win-win is necessary for both individuals and the society. This research, including two studies, aimed to develop and validate a measurement of the win-win scale. In the first study, we screened the items by item analysis and extracted common factors using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), thus determining a total of 25 items in the initial scale consisted of five dimensions including integrity, advancement, altruism, harmoniousness, and coordination. In the second study, we used first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the scaleâ€™s construct validity. The results indicated a good fit between the five-factor model and the data. Based on our results, we have formed a win-win scale by keeping 16 items from the original project pool.","authors":["Shan Zhang","Xinlei Zang","Feng Zhang"],"meta":["May 2021Frontiers in Psychology 12","DOI:10.3389/fpsyg.2021.657015"],"references":["348738646_Narrativity_and_Referential_Activity_Predict_Episodic_Memory_Strength_in_Autobiographical_Memories","336471717_Good_and_evil_in_Chinese_culture_Personality_structure_and_connotation","324090557_Responsibility_Voids_and_Cooperation","322071114_A_Second-Order_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_of_the_Moral_Distress_Scale-Revised_for_Nurses","332747270_I_May_Not_Agree_With_You_but_I_Trust_You_Caring_About_Social_Issues_Signals_Integrity","332535403_Crosscutting_circles_in_a_social_dilemma_Effects_of_social_identity_and_inequality_on_cooperation","331688195_Development_and_validation_of_the_responses_to_sexual_rejection_scale","328259982_The_Cognitive_Foundations_of_Cooperation","324348130_The_Logic_of_Collective_Action_Public_Goods_and_the_Theory_of_Groups","316806105_Statistical_Analysis_of_Management_Data"]}
