{"id":"325583173_Complex_network_techniques_for_climatological_data_analysis","abstract":"Complex network theory provides a powerful toolbox for studying the structure of statistical interrelationships between multiple time series in various scientific disciplines. Complementing frequently used methods of eigenanalysis such as empirical orthogonal functions, climate networks allow to flexibly combine advanced nonlinear and informationtheoretical measures for quantifying interactions between climatological time series with manifold concepts and methods from complex network theory. This chapter summarizes the corresponding theoretical foundations as well as recent applications in the field of climate network analysis for different climatic observables, including the treatment of coupled climatological fields and heterogeneous spatial distributions of climate observations.","authors":["Reik V.
