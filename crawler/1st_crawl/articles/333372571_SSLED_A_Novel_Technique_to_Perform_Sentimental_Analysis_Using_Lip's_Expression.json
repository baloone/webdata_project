Sentimental Analysis becomes the burning issue and with the emergence of image analysis, face detection, recognition and then to perform sentimental analysis on it becomes the major challenges to achieve. We have taken one such big challenge of performing sentimental analysis on image and thus proposed a novel methodology named SSLED in which we have stored segmented images in a repository with tags that depict surprise, sadness, anger, joy, fear, disgust, contempt and then compare the input image to them and finding the pattern and thus finding sentiments of an individuals. These images were taken during a technical and innovative event. The result describes enthusiasm, energy and sentiments of people attending such events.","authors":["Mohammad Shabaz","Shariq Rashid"],"meta":["May 2019","Project: Face Detection and Face Recognition to find Sentimental Analysis"],"references":["322897107_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_A_Survey_and_Real-World_User_Experiences_in_Mixed_Reality","322810419_A_Brief_Review_of_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Based_on_Visual_Information","320204103_A_performance_comparison_of_two_emotion-recognition_implementations_using_OpenCV_and_Cognitive_Services_API","236953631_Analysis_of_Face_Recognition_Under_Varying_Facial_Expression_A_Survey","313456493_Convolutional_MKL_Based_Multimodal_Emotion_Recognition_and_Sentiment_Analysis"]}
