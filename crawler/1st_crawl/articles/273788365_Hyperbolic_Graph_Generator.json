{"id":"273788365_Hyperbolic_Graph_Generator","abstract":"Networks representing many complex systems in nature and society share some\ncommon structural properties like heterogeneous degree distributions and strong\nclustering. Recent research on network geometry has shown that those real\nnetworks can be adequately modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic\nspaces. In this paper, we present a computer program to generate such graphs.\nBesides real-world-like networks, the program can generate random graphs from\nother well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model, random\ngeometric graphs on a circle, or Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. The\nsimulations show a good match between the expected values of different network\nstructural properties and the corresponding empirical values measured in\ngenerated graphs, confirming the accurate behavior of the program.","authors":["Rodrigo Aldecoa","Chiara Orsini","Dmitri Krioukov"],"meta":["March 2015Computer Physics Communications 196","DOI:10.1016/j.cpc.2015.05.028","SourcearXiv"],"references":["230841621_Popularity_versus_Similarity_in_Growing_Networks","49750714_Hyperbolic_Geometry_of_Complex_Networks","12779869_Albert_R_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks_Science_286_509-512","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","268611770_Lectures_on_Complex_Networks","265461971_Random_Geometric_Graphs","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","258520810_Connectivity_of_soft_random_geometric_graphs","255919927_Computing_the_Hypergeometric_Function","225027304_Network_Mapping_by_Replaying_Hyperbolic_Growth","221995860_On_Random_Graphs","200111159_Random_Graphs","46273930_Sustaining_the_Internet_with_Hyperbolic_Mapping","8036135_Statistical_mechanics_of_networks"]}
