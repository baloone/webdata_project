It is being considered as the best ever innovation in the education system. This paper attempts to study the publication trends of research on MOOCs, especially published from India during 2007-2018 indexed in Web of Science, their research visualization network by using co-word analysis, top authors’ contribution, and cross country collaboration. Further, it highlights the world-wide publication trends of research on MOOCs, countries’ contributions, and focused research areas. There were a total of 4294 documents published worldwide based on or related to MOOCs research indexed in WoS as on the searching date of 01st November 2019. A total of 155 publications were retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection database limited to only internal indexes such as: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, BKCI-S, BKCI-SSH, ESCI, and CCR-EXPANDED for this study considering all types of documents published from India. It was found out that most of India’s MOOC research is from Computer Science background focused on MOOC development, e-learning, machine learning, etc. Researchers from countries like USA, Australia and Japan were the top collaborators with Indian researchers. The keywords analysis, top-authors, and countries collaboration have been explored using Bibliometrix package and VOSviewer tool.","authors":["Pallab Pradhan"],"meta":["December 2019"],"references":["327442232_China's_MOOC_Research_Hotspot_Based_on_the_Visual_Co-Word_Network_Map_1994-2018","316894067_Research_contributions_on_the_educational_use_of_MOOCs","306389644_Research_Trends_in_Massive_Open_Online_Course_MOOC_Theses_and_Dissertations_Surfing_the_Tsunami_Wave","272831678_Nascent_Research_Trends_in_MOOCs_in_Higher_Educational_Institutions_A_Systematic_Literature_Review"]}
