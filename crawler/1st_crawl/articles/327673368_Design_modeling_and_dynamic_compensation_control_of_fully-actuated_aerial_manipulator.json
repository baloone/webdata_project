Firstly, the mechanical structure of the new fully-actuated rotor aerial manipulator (AM) is designed and analyzed. Secondly, the kinematic and dynamic models of the system are built using Craig parameter method and recursion Newton-Euler equation, respectively; and a more accurate dynamic relationship between aerial platform and manipulator is obtained. Then, the dynamic-compensation PID control method is proposed aiming at the fully-actuated control problem of rotor AM. Finally, the uniform coupled matrix equations between driving force/moment and rotor speed of the rotor CM are derived, which realizes the design, analysis and decoupling calculation. In simulation the practical problems including random noise and perturbation, parameter uncertainty, and power limitation are considered; and simulation results show that the designed AM system can complete the fully-actuated control that is impossible to be realized theoretically using traditional rotor AM, and achieves advanced control performance. Compared with Backstepping control method, the proposed dynamic compensation PID control method achieves better control accuracy and stronger disturbance rejection capability in two simulations of the rotor aerial operation tasks with manipulator motion. Dynamic compensation control experiment verifies the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.","authors":["L. Ma","D. Wang","Y. Li","Z.
