{"id":"305822050_Aperiodic_disturbance_rejection_in_a_modified_repetitive-control_system","abstract":"This paper presents a method of designing a modified output-feedback repetitive-control system (MOFRCS) that exploits the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach to improve the aperiodic-disturbance rejection performance. The aperiodic disturbances are estimated by an EID estimator and suppressed by incorporation of the estimation into a repetitive control law. First, the configuration of the EID-based MOFRCS is described. Next, a sufficient stability condition is derived by employing the separation and small gain theorems. Then, the methods of designing an MOFRCS and an EID estimator are explained. Finally, some simulation results of a rotational control system are used to demonstrate the validity of the method.","authors":["Lan Zhou","Jinhua She"],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Control Automation and Systems 14(4):883-892","DOI:10.1007/s12555-015-0146-4"],"references":["273021668_Estimation_and_rejection_of_aperiodic_disturbance_in_a_modified_repetitive-control_system","261768405_Aperiodic_Disturbance_Rejection_in_Repetitive-Control_Systems","224198371_Repetitive_controller_for_time-delay_systems_based_on_disturbance_observer","3352853_Design_of_a_repetitive_controller_An_application_to_the_track-following_servo_system_of_optical_disk_drives","3219709_Improving_Disturbance-Rejection_Performance_Based_on_an_Equivalent-Input-Disturbance_Approach","3020073_Repetitive_control_system_A_new_type_servo_system_for_periodic_exogenous_signals","271605727_Robust_Iterative_Learning_Controller_Design_using_the_Performance_Weighting_Function_of_Feedback_Control_Systems","270753130_Design_of_Robust_Modified_Repetitive-Control_System_for_Linear_Periodic_Plants","262056350_New_Results_on_Output_Feedback_H_infty_Control_for_Linear_Discrete-Time_Systems","251834556_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_Optical_Disk_Recording_System_based_on_Sudden_Disturbance_Observer","245322410_Robust_stabilization_for_a_class_of_discrete-time_non-linear_systems_via_output_feedback_The_unified_LMI_approach","235628235_Design_of_a_robust_observer-based_modified_repetitive-control_system","225075788_Robust_and_Optimal_Control","223036731_Repetitive_control_of_tubular_heat_exchangers","220045336_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities_in_System_and_Control_Theory","3111217_H_repetitive_control_for_pickup_head_flying_height_in_near-field_optical_disk_drives","3028983_A_New_Approach_to_the_Perfect_Regulation_and_the_Bounded_Peaking_in_Linear_Multivariable_Control_Systems","3022506_Noncausal_inverses_for_linear_systems","3021851_A_Function_Space_Approach_to_Sampled-Data_Control_Systems_And_Tracking_Problems"]}
