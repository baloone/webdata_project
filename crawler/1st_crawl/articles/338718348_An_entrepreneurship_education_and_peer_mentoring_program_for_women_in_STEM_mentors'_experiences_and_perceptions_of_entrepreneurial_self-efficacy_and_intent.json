{"id":"338718348_An_entrepreneurship_education_and_peer_mentoring_program_for_women_in_STEM_mentors'_experiences_and_perceptions_of_entrepreneurial_self-efficacy_and_intent","abstract":"Women are underrepresented in STEM and in entrepreneurship but are rare in STEM entrepreneurship. A gender-sensitive entrepreneurship education and peer mentoring program for women engineering and computer science students was developed to provide classroom instruction, experiential learning, and support to a small group of students. This paper reports on the experiences of student peer mentors in the program, in terms of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) and entrepreneurial intent (EI). Qualitative methods were adopted for this study. Student mentors were interviewed about their experiences and reported increased perceptions of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, a greater awareness of diversity and gender issues, and a changed perspective on problem solving and life in general. Student mentors reported a distinct interest in becoming an entrepreneur at “some time” in their lives, although not necessarily immediately upon graduation.","authors":["Catherine Elliott","Catherine Mavriplis","Hanan Anis"],"meta":["March 2020International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal 16(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11365-019-00624-2"],"references":["343752204_Factors_and_Influences_on_High_School_Students'_Career_Choices","336589778_Why_Research_on_Women_Entrepreneurs_Needs_New_Directions","319994431_The_Status_of_Women_in_STEM_in_Higher_Education_A_Review_of_the_Literature_2007-2017","346869123_Entrepreneurial_Potential_and_Potential_Entrepreneurs","325081089_Getting_to_Gender_Parity_in_a_Top-Tier_Mechanical_Engineering_Department_A_Case_Study","322240298_Encouraging_technology-based_ventures_Entrepreneurship_education_and_engineering_graduates","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","315974626_ENTREPRENEURIAL_EDUCATION_IN_ENGINEERING_CURRICULA_AT_THE_UNIVERSITY_OF_TORONTO","312967656_Implementing_entrepreneurial_ideas_The_case_for_intentions","310842441_Social_dimensions_of_entrepreneurship","310479519_Gender_social_salience_and_social_performance_how_women_pursue_and_perform_in_social_ventures","308123824_Does_Postsecondary_Persistence_in_STEM_Vary_by_Gender","301761619_Social_enterprise_Gender_gap_and_economic_development","306257588_Hard_and_heavy_Towards_a_new_sociology_of_masculinity","286703323_A_feminist_inquiry_into_entrepreneurship_training"]}
