{"id":"308364010_Generalized_Exact_Holographic_Mapping_with_Wavelets","abstract":"The idea of renormalization is pervasive across disciplines. It has drawn numerous surprising connections between physical systems under the guise of holographic duality, and has also spurred the development of wavelet theory widely applied in computer science. Through the synergy of these two developments, we describe in this paper a generalized holographic mapping that preserves the form of a large class of lattice Hamiltonians. By taking advantage of the full generality of biorthogonal wavelets, we obtain a realization of holography based on iterated unitary operators, each involving an arbitrary even number of sites. Our generalized framework also enables a clearer understanding of the resultant bulk geometry by separating features that are fundamentally associated with the physical system from those that are basis-specific. The number of nonvanishing moments of the high pass wavelet filter is shown to be proportional to the radius of the dual Anti deSitter space geometry. We conclude by proposing modifications to the mapping for systems with generic Fermi pockets.","authors":["Ching Hua Lee"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.96.245103"],"references":["316780376_2pi-flux_loop_semimetals","315764775_Nodal-link_semimetals","312082814_Topological_Nonsymmorphic_Metals_from_Band_Inversion","304476408_Emergent_geometry_thermal_CFT_and_surfacestate_correspondence","311736728_A_defect_in_holographic_interpretations_of_tensor_networks","308964667_Loop_Quantum_Gravity_Exact_Holographic_Mapping_and_Holographic_Entanglement_Entropy","307894848_Holographic_duality_between_21-dimensional_quantum_anomalous_Hall_state_and_31-dimensional_topological_insulators","306187452_Random_Fractal_Ansatz_for_the_configurations_of_Two-Dimensional_Critical_Systems","305616064_Line_nodes_Dirac_points_and_Lifshitz_transition_in_2D_nonsymmorphic_photonic_crystals","305288122_Inverse_Mellin_Transformation_of_Continuous_Singular_Value_Decomposition_A_Root_to_Holographic_Renormalization","303367445_Thermal_geometry_from_CFT_at_finite_temperature","303277081_Tunable_Weyl_Semimetals_in_Periodically_Driven_Nodal_Line_Semimetals","286611335_Negative_differential_resistance_and_characteristic_nonlinear_electromagnetic_response_of_a_Topological_Insulator","303488405_Holographic_Entanglement_Renormalization_of_Topological_Insulators","300368618_Entanglement_Renormalization_and_Wavelets"]}
