Specially, in the case where the shape control parameter equals zero, the\n\nλ\n\n-Bézier curves degenerate to the classical Bézier curves. In this paper, the shape modification of\n\nλ\n\n-Bézier curves by constrained optimization of position and tangent vector is investigated. The definition and properties of\n\nλ\n\n-Bézier curves are given in detail, and the shape modification is implemented by optimizing perturbations of control points. At the same time, the explicit formulas of modifying control points and shape parameter are obtained by Lagrange multiplier method. Using this algorithm,\n\nλ\n\n-Bézier curves are modified to satisfy the specified constraints of position and tangent vector, meanwhile the shape-preserving property is still retained. In order to illustrate its ability on adjusting the shape of\n\nλ\n\n-Bézier curves, some curve design applications are discussed, which show that the proposed method is effective and easy to implement.","authors":["Gang Hu","Xiaomin Ji","Xinqiang Qin","Suxia Zhang"],"meta":["October 2015Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2015(6):1-12","DOI:10.1155/2015/735629"],"references":["258390329_Quasi-Bezier_Curves_with_Shape_Parameters","290029220_Shape_modification_of_UNRBS_surfaces_via_constrained_optimization","286997912_Shape_modification_of_Bezier_curves_by_constrained_optimization_of_position_and_tangent_vector","286915409_Shape_modification_of_Bezier_curves_by_constrained_optimization","285965754_Quartic_generalized_Bezier_surfaces_with_multiple_shape_parameters_and_its_continuity_conditions","271011355_A_novel_extension_to_the_polynomial_basis_functions_describing_Bezier_curves_and_surfaces_of_degree_n_with_multiple_shape_parameters","265590954_Weight-based_shape_modification_of_NURBS_curves_by_constrained_optimization","264902270_Curve_construction_based_on_four_-Bernstein-like_basis_functions","262194862_Construction_of_PH_splines_based_on_H-Bezier_curves","226729157_Shape_modification_of_Bezier_curves_by_constrained_optimization"]}
