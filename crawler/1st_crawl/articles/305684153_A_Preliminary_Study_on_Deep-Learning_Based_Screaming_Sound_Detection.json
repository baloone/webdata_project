{"id":"305684153_A_Preliminary_Study_on_Deep-Learning_Based_Screaming_Sound_Detection","abstract":"In addition to the traditional video surveillance, various audio processing techniques can also be added to the existing CCTV cameras. They can be used as additional features to help in analyzing the scene better and autonomously detecting violence or any unwanted activity in the scene. For this purpose, a deep learning based scream sound detection approach is proposed in this paper. MFCC features after interpolation are used as input of the system. The proposed system is experimented using a self-recorded scream database and with controlled and calculated parameters 100 % accuracy is achieved.","authors":["Zaigham Zaheer","Jin Young Kim","Hyoung-Gook Kim","Seung You"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292925","Conference: ICITCS 2015","Project: Deep Learning Based Home Acoustic Analysis and Scream Recognition"],"references":["264141819_An_Analysis_of_Vulnerabilities_and_Performance_on_the_CCTV_Security_Monitoring_and_Control","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","200744481_Exploring_Strategies_for_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks","2391428_Thai_Text-Dependent_Speaker_Identification_by_ANN_with_Two_Different_Time_Normalization_Techniques","272992853_Analysis_on_Scream_and_Ambient_Noise_for_Security_System_with_Audio_Capability","224158309_Scream_detection_for_home_applications","200744453_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","46392541_Deep_Big_Simple_Neural_Nets_for_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","3784460_Thai_polysyllabic_word_recognition_using_fuzzy-neural_network"]}
