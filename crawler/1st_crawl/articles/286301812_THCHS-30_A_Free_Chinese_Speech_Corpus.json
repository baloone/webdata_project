{"id":"286301812_THCHS-30_A_Free_Chinese_Speech_Corpus","abstract":"Speech data is crucially important for speech recognition research. There are\nquite some speech databases that can be purchased at prices that are reasonable\nfor most research institutes. However, for young people who just start research\nactivities or those who just gain initial interest in this direction, the cost\nfor data is still an annoying barrier. We support the `free data' movement in\nspeech recognition: research institutes (particularly supported by public\nfunds) publish their data freely so that new researchers can obtain sufficient\ndata to kick of their career. In this paper, we follow this trend and release a\nfree Chinese speech database THCHS-30 that can be used to build a full- edged\nChinese speech recognition system. We report the baseline system established\nwith this database, including the performance under highly noisy conditions.","authors":["Dong Wang","Xuewei Zhang"],"meta":["December 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276351001_A_Fast_Learning_Method_for_Multilayer_Perceptrons_in_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_Systems","273294837_Noisy_training_for_deep_neural_networks_in_speech_recognition","262157198_A_Historical_Perspective_of_Speech_Recognition","261153438_Recent_advances_in_deep_learning_for_speech_research_at_Microsoft","304414762_Music_removal_by_convolutional_denoising_autoencoder_in_speech_recognition","290547728_Reverberant_speech_recognition_based_on_denoising_autoencoder","289434736_Sequence-discriminative_training_of_deep_neural_networks","286595372_Noisy_training_for_deep_neural_networks","267378674_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Noise_Reduction_in_Robust_ASR","234131151_Feature_Learning_in_Deep_Neural_Networks_-_Studies_on_Speech_Recognition_Tasks"]}
