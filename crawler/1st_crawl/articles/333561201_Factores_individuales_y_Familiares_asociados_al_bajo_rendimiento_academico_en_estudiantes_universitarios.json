{"id":"333561201_Factores_individuales_y_Familiares_asociados_al_bajo_rendimiento_academico_en_estudiantes_universitarios","abstract":"The objective of this research is to discover the family and individual factors associated with the low academic achievement of university students in a private institution in northern Mexico. A comparison was made with high achievers in order to determine the differences between the two groups. The participants were 96 students: 48 students had a GPA of less than 7.5/10.0 and the other 48 had a GPA of 9.0/10.0 or more. Five self-evaluation scales of the Likert type were used. The results point to significant differences in the variables of paternal autonomy, paternal imposition, expertise, work, study strategies, attitude toward study, self-concept in academic terms, and spiritual beliefs. © 2019 Consejo Mexicano de Investigacion Educativa.
