{"id":"314297051_WebSAIL_Computer-based_Methods_for_Enhancing_Web_Search_Literacy","abstract":"Recent studies reveal that most Web search engine users lack of appropriate search strategies for finding information efficiently and effectively, and overestimate their capabilities in the domain of Web search. As a consequence these users spend more time in searching for information and also do not always find the best results. They eventually miss out on important information and may not even be aware of this fact, especially in more complex Web search tasks. Users get frustrated after failing at finding information they are looking for and abandon the search session at worst. We launched the WebSAIL project to tackle these deficits by promoting Web search literacy. Different methods (i.e., a tutorial, scaffolding, and gamification) will be used for training. In the end we will compare the applied methods to determine whether Web search literacy can be enhanced at all, whether acquired knowledge is long-lasting and which method has the biggest impact on the enhancement of Web search literacy.","authors":["Ioannis Karatassis"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1145/3020165.3022171","Conference: the 2017 Conference"],"references":["259841647_Defining_Gamification_-_A_Service_Marketing_Perspective","255605092_Scaffolding_Disciplined_Inquiry_in_Problem-Based_Environments","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","230728062_It_is_always_a_lot_of_fun_Exploring_dimensions_of_digital_game_experience_using_focus_group_methodology","230691960_The_Search_Dashboard_How_Reflection_and_Comparison_Impact_Search_Behavior","221516065_How_does_Search_Behavior_Change_as_Search_Becomes_More_Difficult","221436814_Effects_of_low_high_literacy_on_user_performance_in_information_search_and_retrieval","220877193_DocWizards_A_system_for_authoring_follow-me_documentation_wizards","215835935_Cognitive_Tutors_Lessons_Learned","336586596_Effects_of_Low_High_Literacy_on_User_Performance_in_Information_Search_and_Retrieval","325198830_Scaffolding_Disciplined_Inquiry_in_Problem-Based_Learning_Environments","300726391_A_Framework_for_Automatically_Generating_Interactive_Instructional_Scaffolding","284340561_Cognitive_tutors_Lessons_learned","235310520_Internet_search_tactics","227732515_Information_Search_Tactics"]}
