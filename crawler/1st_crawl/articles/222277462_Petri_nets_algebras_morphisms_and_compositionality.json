{"id":"222277462_Petri_nets_algebras_morphisms_and_compositionality","abstract":"It is shown how a category of Petri nets can be viewed as a subcategory of two sorted algebras over multisets. This casts Petri nets in a familiar framework and provides a useful idea of morphism on nets different from the conventional definition—the morphisms here respect the behaviour of nets. The categorical constructions which result provide a useful way to synthesise nets and reason about nets in terms of their components; for example, various forms of parallel composition of Petri nets arise naturally from the product in the category. This abstract setting makes plain a useful functor from the category of Petri nets to a category of spaces of invariants and provides insight into the generalisations of the basic definition of Petri nets—for instance, the coloured and higher level nets of Kurt Jensen arise through a simple modification of the sorts of the algebras underlying nets. Further, it provides a smooth formal relation with other models of concurrency such as Milner's calculus of communicating systems (CCS) and Hoare's communicating sequential processes (CSP), though this is only indicated in this paper.","authors":["Glynn Winskel"],"meta":["March 1987Information and Computation 72(3):197-238","DOI:10.1016/0890-5401(87)90032-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["223544686_Petri_Nets_Event_Structures_and_Domains_Part_I","221502618_The_specification_of_process_synchronization_by_path_expressions","221150276_Functional_Behaviour_of_Nondeterministic_Programs","220995283_A_New_Definition_of_Morphism_on_Petri_Nets","279948530_An_Introduction_to_Inductive_Definitions","262396232_Communicating_Sequential_Process","239552888_Net_theory_and_applications","238711058_Arrows_Structures_and_Functors_The_Categorical_Imperative","227175004_Processes_of_placetransition-nets","225912002_Formal_semantics_of_a_class_of_high-level_primitives_for_coordinating_concurrent_processes"]}
