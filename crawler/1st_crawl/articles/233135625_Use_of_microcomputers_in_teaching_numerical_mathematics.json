{"id":"233135625_Use_of_microcomputers_in_teaching_numerical_mathematics","abstract":"This paper describes the experiences of the staff of the Mathematics Department at Coventry (Lanchester) Polytechnic in their attempts to develop microcomputer‚Äêbased software for use with science and engineering undergraduates. These programs are designed to support lecture courses in numerical mathematics. We discuss the programming difficulties encountered and describe the type of student exercise which can be set in practical classes.","authors":["I. B. Jacques","C. J.
