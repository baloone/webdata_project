{"id":"234809540_Grammatical_inference_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","abstract":"This paper takes up the topic of a task of training Grammar-based Classifier System (GCS) to learn grammar from data. GCS is a new model of Learning Classifier Systems in which the population of classifiers has a form of a context-free grammar rule set in a Chomsky Normal Form. GCS has been proposed to address both the natural language grammar induction and also learning formal grammar for DNA sequence. In both cases near-optimal solutions or better than reported in the literature were obtained.","authors":["Olgierd Unold"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["280645710_Agent-Based_Computational_Economics","313077576_Escaping_brittleness_The_possibilities_of_general_purpose_learning_algorithms_applied_to_parallel_rule-based_systems","310911960_An_introduction_to_anticipatory_classifier_systems","285182931_Adaptation","268487392_USING_KNOWLEDGE-BASED_NEURAL_NETWORKS_TO_REFINE_EXISTING_BIOLOGICAL_THEORIES","268043850_AN_EVOLUTIONARY_APPROACH_TO_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GRAMMAR_INDUCTION","267122432_Context-free_grammar_induction_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","244446198_UCI_Repository_of_machine_learning_databases_Machine-readable_data_repository","242406147_Definite_clause_grammars_for_language_analysis","237044495_Biological_Sequence_Analysis"]}
