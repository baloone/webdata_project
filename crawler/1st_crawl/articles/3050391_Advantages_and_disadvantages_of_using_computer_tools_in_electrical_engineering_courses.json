{"id":"3050391_Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_using_computer_tools_in_electrical_engineering_courses","abstract":"This paper discusses different computer tools used to help\ndeliver, administer, and teach the material covered in two basic\nundergraduate courses in electrical engineering. The computer\nfacilities, programs and tutorials developed are discussed; however, the\npaper concentrates more on analyzing the results of using these tools in\nthe student learning process. The students' marks and the results of\nseveral student surveys, as well as the teaching staff's observations,\nare used to evaluate the usefulness of the different tools and determine\ntheir advantages and disadvantages. Some unexpected results regarding\nthe actual students' use of these tools are also presented and\nthoroughly analyzed","authors":["C.A. Canizares","Zeno T.
