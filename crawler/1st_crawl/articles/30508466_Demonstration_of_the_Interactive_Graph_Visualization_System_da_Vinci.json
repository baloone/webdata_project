{"id":"30508466_Demonstration_of_the_Interactive_Graph_Visualization_System_da_Vinci","abstract":"We present the graph visualization system da Vinci, an interactive tool that can be used by arbitrary application programs as a user interface for graph data structures. Beside a novel automatic layout algorithm for graphs, da Vinci offers many interactive facilities such as finetuning of a layout, abstractions and scaling operations. A bidirectional application interface is used for tool communication with a program that controls the graph structure.","authors":["Michael Fr√∂hlich","Mattias Werner"],"meta":["October 1994","DOI:10.1007/3-540-58950-3_379","Conference: Proceedings of the DIMACS International Workshop on Graph Drawing"],"references":["34825074_Interactive_graph_layout_the_exploration_of_large_graphs","267684377_A_LINEAR_TIME_ALGORITHMS_FOR_LAYOUT_OF_GENERALIZED_TREES","247921242_The_Graph_Visualization_System_daVinci_-_A_User_Interface_for_Applications","242540768_Methods_for_visual_understanding_of_heirarchical_systems","221557200_GraphEd_a_Graphical_Platform_for_the_Implementation_of_Graph_Algorithms","46953037_The_Design_of_an_Extendible_Graph_Editor","3115111_Methods_for_Visual_Understanding_of_Hierarchical_Systems_Structure","2821926_Graph_Layout_through_the_VCG_Tool"]}
