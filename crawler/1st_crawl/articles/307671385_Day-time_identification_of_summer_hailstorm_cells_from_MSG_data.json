{"id":"307671385_Day-time_identification_of_summer_hailstorm_cells_from_MSG_data","abstract":"Identifying deep convection is of paramount importance, as it may be\nassociated with extreme weather that has significant impact on the\nenvironment, property and the population. A new method, the Hail\nDetection Tool (HDT), is described for identifying hail-bearing storms\nusing multi-spectral Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data. HDT was\nconceived as a two-phase method, in which the first step is the\nConvective Mask (CM) algorithm devised for detection of deep\nconvection, and the second a Hail Detection algorithm (HD) for the\nidentification of hail-bearing clouds among cumulonimbus systems\ndetected by CM. Both CM and HD are based on logistic regression models\ntrained with multi-spectral MSG data-sets comprised of summer\nconvective events in the middle Ebro Valley between 2006–2010, and\ndetected by the RGB visualization technique (CM) or C-band weather\nradar system of the University of León. By means of the logistic\nregression approach, the probability of identifying a cumulonimbus\nevent with CM or a hail event with HD are computed by exploiting\na proper selection of MSG wavelengths or their combination. A number\nof cloud physical properties (liquid water path, optical thickness and\neffective cloud drop radius) were used to physically interpret results\nof statistical models from a meteorological perspective, using\na method based on these \"ingredients.\" Finally, the HDT was applied\nto a new validation sample consisting of events during summer\n2011. The overall Probability of Detection (POD) was 76.9% and\nFalse Alarm Ratio 16.7%.","authors":["Andrés Merino","L.
