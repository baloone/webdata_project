{"id":"224920402_Formal_Specification_of_Medical_Systems_by_Proof-Based_Refinement","abstract":"Formal methods have emerged as an alternative approach to ensuring quality and correctness of highly critical systems, overcoming limitations of traditional validation techniques such as simulation and testing. We propose a refinement-based methodology for complex medical systems design, which possesses all the required key features. A refinement-based combined approach of formal verification, model validation using a model-checker and refinement chart is proposed in this methodology for designing a high-confidence medical device. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of this methodology for the design of a cardiac pacemaker system.","authors":["Dominique Mery","Neeraj Kumar Singh"],"meta":["January 2013ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","DOI:10.1145/2406336.2406351"],"references":["257921675_Bioelectromagnetism","234776619_Roadmap_for_enhanced_languages_and_methods_to_aid_verification","225168260_Generating_Programs_Plus_Proofs_by_Refinement","225100541_Incremental_Development_of_a_Distributed_Real-Time_Model_of_a_Cardiac_Pacing_System_Using_VDM","224920549_Real-Time_Animation_for_Formal_Specification","224920490_Functional_Behavior_of_a_Cardiac_Pacing_System","221267788_Formal_Specification_of_a_Cardiac_Pacing_System","220845706_Hybrid_Implementations_of_Algebraic_Specifications","220643307_A_case_study_on_applying_formal_methods_to_medical_devices_Computer-aided_resuscitation_algorithm_International_Journal_on_Software_Tools_for_Technology_Transfer_54_320-330","220566042_The_Verified_Software_Initiative_A_Manifesto","220305686_Hardwaresoftware_synthesis_of_formal_specifications_in_codesign_of_embedded_systems","220165270_A_Tool_for_Performance_Evaluation_in_a_Formal_Codesign_Framework","50950138_Trustable_Formal_Specification_for_Software_Certification","48411884_EB2C_a_tool_for_Event-B_to_C_conversion_support","42325552_Technical_Report_on_Formal_Development_of_Two-Electrode_Cardiac_Pacing_System","29597220_Pacemaker's_Functional_Behaviors_in_Event-B","3187701_Modechart_A_specification_language_for_real-time_systems","2956521_A_Formal_Methods_Approach_to_Medical_Device_Review","2956509_High-Confidence_Medical_Device_Software_and_Systems","335368650_The_Pacemaker_Challenge","298239214_Software_verification_with_BLAST","289890246_Cardiac_pacemakers_and_defibrillators","277298616_Realizing_Changes_of_Operational_Modes_with_a_Pre_Run-Time_Scheduled_Hard_Real-Time_System","267001177_Software_engineering_3_Domains_requirements_and_software_design","266966492_Formal_methods_for_industrial_applications_Specification_and_programming_the_Steam_Boiler_Control","266237775_Logics_of_Specification_Languages","262726678_Statecharts_A_Visual_Formalism_For_Complex_Systems","262318870_Hoare_CAR_The_verifying_compiler_A_grand_challenge_for_computing_research_Journal_of_the_ACM_501_63-69","247084865_Orna_Grumberg_and_Doron_Peled","245611982_Cardiac_pacing_and_ICDs","242550238_Formal_methods_for_industrial_applications_specifying_and_programming_the_steam_boiler_control","234825825_Principles_of_Model_Checking_Representation_and_Mind_Series","234801416_An_Introduction_to_Requirements_Capture_Using_PVS_Specification_of_a_Simple_Autopilot","226575366_Verification_and_Integration_of_Real-Time_Control_Software","225435063_Proved_Development_of_the_Real-Time_Properties_of_the_IEEE_1394_Root_Contention_Protocol_with_the_Event_B_Method","225115215_Modal_Systems_Specification_Refinement_and_Realisation","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","221388191_Specifying_the_mode_logic_of_a_Flight_Guidance_System_in_CoRE_and_SCR","220993588_First_Steps_in_the_Verified_Software_Grand_Challenge","220695465_Modeling_in_Event-B_-_System_and_Software_Engineering","220414394_Mode_Change_Protocols_for_Real-Time_Systems_A_Survey_and_a_New_Proposal","220349693_The_Verification_Grand_Challenge","50811893_The_Event-B_Modelling_Method_-_Concepts_and_Case_Studies","30870069_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","18360082_The_pacemaker_challenge","12609111_A_review_of_the_FDA_draft_guidance_document_for_software_validation_guidance_for_industry","10765602_Cardiac_Pacemakers_implantable_defibrillators_and_IRM","8259394_Validation_of_medical_modeling_simulation_training_devices_and_systems","5351124_ACCAHAHRS_2008_Guidelines_for_Device-Based_Therapy_of_Cardiac_Rhythm_Abnormalities_a_report_of_the_American_College_of_CardiologyAmerican_Heart_Association_Task_Force_on_Practice_Guidelines_Writing_Co","5321934_ACCAHAHRS_2008_Guidelines_for_device-based_therapy_of_cardiac_rhythm_abnormalities","2526537_Safety-Critical_Systems_Formal_Methods_and_Standards","2882064_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2557442_Alloy_A_Lightweight_Object_Modelling_Notation","2452375_Realizing_Changes_of_Operational_Modes_with_a_Pre_Run-Time_Scheduled_Hard_Real-Time_System"]}
