{"id":"222555759_Reversible_Computation_and_Reversible_Programming_Languages","abstract":"A reversible programming language supports deterministic forward and backward computation. This tutorial focuses on a high-level reversible programming language Janus. In common with other programming paradigms, reversible programming has its own programming methodology. Janus is simple, yet powerful, and its constructs can serve as a model for designing reversible languages in general.","authors":["Tetsuo Yokoyama"],"meta":["March 2010Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 253(6):71-81","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2010.02.007","SourceDBLP"],"references":["313221631_Conservative_logic","280795712_The_Ecology_of_Destruction","279391617_The_Science_of_Programming","279352964_The_Science_of_Programming","274904300_On_Language","270405581_Reverse_Engineering","266863568_A_Reversible_Virtual_Machine","246980808_Notes_on_the_history_of_reversible_computation","231056961_The_decomposition_of_an_arbitrary_reversible_logic_circuit","226418586_Conservative_Logic"]}
