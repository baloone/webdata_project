{"id":"335099826_Photon_limited_ptychography_of_3D_objects_via_Bayesian_reconstruction","abstract":"We introduce a Bayesian framework for ptycho-tomographic imaging of 3D objects under photon-limited conditions. This approach is significantly more robust to measurement noise by incorporating prior information on the probabilities of the object features and the measurement process into the reconstruction problem, and it can improve both temporal and spatial resolution of current and future ptychography instruments. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the proposed optimization problem, where the ptychography and tomography subproblems are both solved using the conjugate-gradient method. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by reconstructing a synthetic 3D integrated chip with a significantly reduced photon-budget for the simulated experiment.","authors":["Viktor V Nikitin","Selin Aslan","Tekin Bicer","Sven Leyffer"],"meta":["August 2019Continuum Journal of Media & Cultural Studies 2(10)","DOI:10.1364/OSAC.2.002948","Project: 3D ptycho-tomography reconstruction"],"references":["331753025_Joint_ptycho-tomography_reconstruction_through_alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers","330547150_Blind_Ptychographic_Phase_Retrieval_via_Convergent_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","330213825_Ptychographic_X-ray_computed_tomography_at_a_high-brilliance_X-ray_source","327914814_Deep_learning_approach_for_Fourier_ptychography_microscopy","323694370_Solving_Fourier_ptychographic_imaging_problems_via_neural_network_modeling_and_TensorFlow","320564829_Partially_Coherent_Ptychography_by_Gradient_Decomposition_of_the_Probe","319880431_Rapid_alignment_of_nanotomography_data_using_joint_iterative_reconstruction_and_reprojection","330941463_Four-Dimensional_Tomographic_Reconstruction_by_Time_Domain_Decomposition","322009344_X-ray_ptychography","319017195_Direct_coupling_of_tomography_and_ptychography"]}
