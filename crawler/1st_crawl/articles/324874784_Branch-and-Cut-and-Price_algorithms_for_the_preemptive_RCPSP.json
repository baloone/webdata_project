{"id":"324874784_Branch-and-Cut-and-Price_algorithms_for_the_preemptive_RCPSP","abstract":"In this article, we address the preemptive Resource-Constrained Precedence Scheduling Problem. We propose two mixed integer formulations containing an exponential number of variables and inequalities. An antichain is a set of pairwise incomparable elements with respect to the precedence constraints. In the first formulation, the integer variables are associated with the antichains. For the second, the integer variables are limited to a particular subset of antichains. We propose two Branch- and-Cut-and-Price algorithms for each of these formulations. We introduce some valid inequalities in order to reinforce the second formulation. Finally, we give some computational results on instances of the PSPLIB and compare the formulations.","authors":["Pierre Fouilhoux","A.
