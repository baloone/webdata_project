{"id":"354471916_Research_on_improved_convolutional_wavelet_neural_network","abstract":"Artificial neural networks (ANN) which include deep learning neural networks (DNN) have problems such as the local minimal problem of Back propagation neural network (BPNN), the unstable problem of Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the limited maximum precision problem of Convolutional neural network (CNN). Performance (training speed, precision, etc.) of BPNN, RBFNN and CNN are expected to be improved. Main works are as follows: Firstly, based on existing BPNN and RBFNN, Wavelet neural network (WNN) is implemented in order to get better performance for further improving CNN. WNN adopts the network structure of BPNN in order to get faster training speed. WNN adopts the wavelet function as an activation function, whose form is similar to the radial basis function of RBFNN, in order to solve the local minimum problem. Secondly, WNN-based Convolutional wavelet neural network (CWNN) method is proposed, in which the fully connected layers (FCL) of CNN is replaced by WNN. Thirdly, comparative simulations based on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets among the discussed methods of BPNN, RBFNN, CNN and CWNN are implemented and analyzed. Fourthly, the wavelet-based Convolutional Neural Network (WCNN) is proposed, where the wavelet transformation is adopted as the activation function in Convolutional Pool Neural Network (CPNN) of CNN. Fifthly, simulations based on CWNN are implemented and analyzed on the MNIST dataset. Effects are as follows: Firstly, WNN can solve the problems of BPNN and RBFNN and have better performance. Secondly, the proposed CWNN can reduce the mean square error and the error rate of CNN, which means CWNN has better maximum precision than CNN. Thirdly, the proposed WCNN can reduce the mean square error and the error rate of CWNN, which means WCNN has better maximum precision than CWNN.","authors":["Jingwei Liu","Peixuan Li","Xuehan Tang","Jiaxin Li"],"meta":["September 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-97195-6"],"references":["354222850_Patients_with_neuromyelitis_optica_spectrum_disorder_NMOSD_are_associated_with_adverse_outcome_after_total_hip_arthroplasty_a_matched_case-control_study","348790625_Clinicopathological_features_of_fibrosarcomatous_dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans_and_the_construction_of_a_back-propagation_neural_network_recognition_model","346170696_Radial_Basis_Function_and_Multi-level_2D_Vector_Field_Approximation","354091494_Effects_of_roasting_temperature_and_time_on_aldehyde_formation_derived_from_lipid_oxidation_in_scallop_Patinopecten_yessoensis_and_the_deterrent_effect_by_antioxidants_of_bamboo_leaves","347841189_Analysis_of_the_rate_of_convergence_of_fully_connected_deep_neural_network_regression_estimates_with_smooth_activation_function","346769239_Application_of_artificial_neural_networks_to_predict_multiple_quality_of_dry-cured_ham_based_on_protein_degradation","346305062_Predicting_the_fuel_flow_rate_of_commercial_aircraft_via_multilayer_perceptron_radial_basis_function_and_ANFIS_artificial_neural_networks","345992618_Self-intumescent_polyelectrolyte_for_flame_retardant_poly_lactic_acid_nonwovens","343907053_Impact_of_cost-benefit_analysis_on_financial_benefit_evaluation_of_investment_projects_under_back_propagation_neural_network","343848985_A_deep_learning_algorithm_using_a_fully_connected_sparse_autoencoder_neural_network_for_landslide_susceptibility_prediction","338838389_Novel_design_of_Morlet_wavelet_neural_network_for_solving_second_order_Lane-Emden_equation","341438980_An_artificial_neural_network-based_forecasting_model_of_energy-related_time_series_for_electrical_grid_management","340279344_Covid-19_Automatic_detection_from_X-Ray_images_utilizing_Transfer_Learning_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","338077863_Multiscale_local_features_learning_based_on_BP_neural_network_for_rolling_bearing_intelligent_fault_diagnosis","337969433_Forecast_the_electricity_price_of_US_using_a_wavelet_transform-based_hybrid_model"]}
