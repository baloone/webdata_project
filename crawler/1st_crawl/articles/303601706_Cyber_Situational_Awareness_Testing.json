{"id":"303601706_Cyber_Situational_Awareness_Testing","abstract":"In the cyber security landscape, the human ability to comprehend and adapt to existing and emerging threats is crucial. Not only technical solutions, but also the operatorâ€™s ability to grasp the complexities of the threats affect the level of success or failure that is achieved in cyber defence. In this paper we discuss the general concept of situation awareness and associated measurement techniques. Further, we describe the cyber domain and how it differs from other domains, and show how predictive knowledge can help improve cyber defence. We discuss how selected existing models and measurement techniques for situation awareness can be adapted and applied in the cyber domain to measure actual levels of cyber situation awareness. We identify generic relevant criteria and other factors to consider, and propose a methodology to set up cyber situation awareness measurement experiments within the context of simulated cyber defence exercises. Such experiments can be used to test the viability of different cyber solutions. A number of concrete possible experiments are also suggested.","authors":["Joel Brynielsson","Ulrik Franke","Stefan Robert Varga"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-38930-1_12","In book: Combatting Cybercrime and Cyberterrorism (pp.209-233)"],"references":["311065719_The_Development_of_Situation_Awareness_Measures_in_ATM_Systems","292211642_Effects_of_Information_Availability_on_Command-and-Control_Decision_Making_Performance_Trust_and_Situation_Awareness","258138570_Situation_Awareness_Is_Adaptive_Externally_Directed_Consciousness","253963614_Situation_Awareness_Mental_Workload_and_Trust_in_Automation_Viable_Empirically_Supported_Cognitive_Engineering_Constructs","252069550_Success_Rate_of_Remote_Code_Execution_Attacks_Expert_Assessments_and_Observations","244953719_Comparative_analysis_of_SAGAT_and_SART_for_evaluations_of_situation_awareness","243779977_A_Survey_of_Situation_Awareness_Requirements_in_Air-to-Air_Combat_Fighters","238320630_Situation_Awareness_Proceed_with_Caution","235210831_Situation_Awareness_As_a_Predictor_of_Performance_in_En_Route_Air_Traffic_Controllers","230745477_Theoretical_underpinnings_of_situation_awareness_A_critical_review","228387660_Quantitative_analysis_of_situational_awareness_QUASA_Applying_signal_detection_theory_to_truefalse_probes_and_self-ratings","210198492_Endsley_MR_Toward_a_Theory_of_Situation_Awareness_in_Dynamic_Systems_Human_Factors_Journal_371_32-64","210198488_Design_and_Evaluation_for_Situation_Awareness_Enhancement","200773058_Measurement_of_Situation_Awareness_in_Dynamic_Systems","48381605_Situation_awareness_Some_remaining_questions","23818885_Situation_Awareness_A_Critical_But_Ill-Defined_Phenomenon","12347389_Team_situation_assessment_and_information_distribution","319770818_Toward_a_theory_of_situation_awareness_in_dynamic_systems_Situation_awareness","313749487_Situation_awareness_is_adaptive_externally-directed_consciousness","291739065_Conquest_in_Cyberspace_National_Security_and_Information_Warfare","291029762_Experimental_Evidence_on_Decision-Making_in_Availability_Service_Level_Agreements","286198793_Cybercrime_The_psychology_of_online_offenders","277115013_Cranfield_situation_awareness_scale","274391344_Situation_Awareness_Misconceptions_and_Misunderstandings","273959972_Attributing_Cyber_Attacks","271767582_Measurement_of_Situation_Awareness_in_Dynamic-Systems","270960158_Situation_Awareness_Information_Requirements_Analysis_for_En_Route_Air_Traffic_Control","263664797_Cyber_situational_awareness_-_A_systematic_review_of_the_literature","262281768_Cyber_Security_Exercises_and_Competitions_as_a_Platform_for_Cyber_Security_Experiments","261689646_Development_of_a_situation_awareness_measure_to_evaluate_advanced_alarm_systems_in_nuclear_power_plant_control_rooms","260135123_What_really_is_going_on_Review_of_situation_awareness_models_for_individuals_and_teams","249727940_Fun_and_GamesThe_Validity_of_Games_for_the_Study_of_Conflict","247535909_Situational_Awareness_Rating_Technique_SART_The_Development_of_a_Tool_for_Aircrew_Systems_Design","247534012_Situation_awareness_in_dynamic_systems","247512444_Approaches_to_understanding_analysing_and_developing_situation_awareness","243775117_Testing_a_Subjective_Metric_of_Situation_Awareness","243768447_Situation_Awareness_in_Team_Performance_Implications_for_Measurement_and_Training","235228378_Measurement_Statistics_and_the_Schemapiric_View","235110157_Assessing_Situation_Awareness_in_Field_Training_Exercises","235028230_Desperately_Seeking_SA","232818198_Theory_of_Activity_and_Situation_Awareness","232571169_Situation_Awareness_Requirements_for_Infantry_Platoon_Leaders","222892126_Securing_future_ATM-concepts'_safety_by_measuring_situation_awareness_in_ATC","222518587_Measuring_Situation_Awareness_in_complex_systems_Comparison_of_measures_study","221427663_elicit_A_System_for_Detecting_Insiders_Who_Violate_Need-to-Know","49400532_Situational_awareness_and_safety","49400418_Measuring_Situation_Awareness_in_Complex_Systems_Comparison_of_measures_study","49400194_Situation_Awareness_Measurement_A_review_of_applicability_for_C4i_environments","17517562_Measurement_statistics_and_the_schemapiric_view_Like_the_faces_of_Janus_science_looks_two_ways--toward_schematics_and_empirics","15181318_Tools_for_assessing_situational_awareness_in_an_operational_fighter_environment","6786946_Measuring_team_situation_awareness_in_decentralized_command_and_control_systems","4130778_Teaching_information_warfare_with_lab_experiments_via_the_Internet","4105626_A_teaching_prototype_for_educating_IT_security_engineers_in_emerging_environments","3544339_Situation_global_assessment_technique_SAGAT","3437990_How_the_Cyber_Defense_Exercise_Shaped_an_Information-Assurance_Curriculum"]}
