{"id":"271855452_A_gap_analysis_of_Internet-of-Things_platforms","abstract":"Nowadays, we experience an abundance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) middleware\nsolutions that provide connectivity for sensors and actuators to the Internet.\nTo gain a widespread adoption, these middleware solutions, referred to as\nplatforms, have to meet the expectations of different players in the IoT\necosystem, including device providers, application developers, and end-users,\namong others. In this article, we evaluate a representative sample of these\nplatforms, both proprietary and open-source, on the basis of their ability to\nmeet the ecosystem expectations. The evaluation is completed by a gap analysis\nof the current IoT landscape with respect to (i) the support of heterogeneous\nhardware, (ii) the capabilities of the platform for data management, (iii) the\nsupport of application developers, (iv) the extensibility of the different\nplatforms for the formation of ecosystems, as well as (v) the availability of\ndedicated marketplaces to the IoT. The gap analysis aims to highlight the\ndeficiencies of today's solutions to improve their integration to tomorrow's\necosystem. Based on the result of the analysis, we conclude this article with a\nlist of recommendations for extending these IoT platforms in order to fill in\nthe gaps.","authors":["Julien Mineraud","Oleksiy Mazhelis","Xiang Su","Sasu Tarkoma"],"meta":["February 2015Computer Communications 89-90","DOI:10.1016/j.comcom.2016.03.015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["300757723_Toward_a_Distributed_Data_Flow_Platform_for_the_Web_of_Things_Distributed_Node-RED","283125570_City_Hub_A_Cloud-Based_IoT_Platform_for_Smart_Cities","271888933_Semantic_data_provisioning_and_reasoning_for_the_Internet_of_Things","271617690_Data_fusion_in_the_Internet_of_Things","271533021_Contemporary_Internet_of_Things_platforms","267958532_Actinium_A_RESTful_Runtime_Container_for_Scriptable_Internet_of_Things_Applications","267722404_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","264591899_Service_Discovery_Protocols_for_Constrained_Machine-to-Machine_Communications","260670514_The_internet_of_things_program_The_finnish_perspective","236334231_IETF_Standardization_in_the_Field_of_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_survey","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","220706115_Market-based_user_innovation_in_the_Internet_of_Things","220169934_A_Smart_Web_Service_Based_on_the_Context_of_Things","5198078_Two-Sided_Competition_of_Proprietary_vs_Open_Source_Technology_Platforms_and_the_Implications_for_the_Software_Industry","288485434_Tactical_Cloudlets_Moving_Cloud_Computing_to_the_Edge","286668583_IoT_Security_Ongoing_Challenges_and_Research_Opportunities","282205128_Security_Trust_and_Implementation_Limitations_of_Prominent_IoT_Platforms","279550906_How_companies_become_platform_leaders","267454881_The_Internet_of_Things_vision_Key_features_applications_and_open_issues","264585236_Data_Mining_for_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","264578911_M2M_Service_Platforms_Survey_Issues_and_Enabling_Technologies","262401220_Thing_broker_A_twitter_for_things","261959565_The_COMPOSE_API_for_the_internet_of_things","261208089_Data_Management_for_Internet_of_Things_Challenges_Approaches_and_Opportunities","261104622_A_Survey_on_Trust_Management_for_Internet_of_Things","259842035_Adding_Semantics_to_Internet_of_Things","259278592_A_Generic_Platform_for_Ubiquitous_and_Subjective_Data","257582417_On_the_features_and_challenges_of_security_and_privacy_in_distributed_Internet_of_things","254061984_CoAP_An_Application_Protocol_for_Billions_of_Tiny_Internet_Nodes","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","224718072_Leveraging_the_Web_A_Universal_Framework_for_Building_Automation","220475753_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things"]}
