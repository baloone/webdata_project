{"id":"265513612_Effect_of_Microvascular_Obstruction_and_Intramyocardial_Hemorrhage_by_CMR_on_LV_Remodeling_and_Outcomes_After_Myocardial_Infarction_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","abstract":"The goal of this systematic analysis is to provide a comprehensive review of the current cardiac magnetic resonance data on microvascular obstruction (MVO) and intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH). Data related to the association of MVO and IMH in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) with left ventricular (LV) function, volumes, adverse LV remodeling, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were critically analyzed. MVO is associated with a lower ejection fraction, increased ventricular volumes and infarct size, and a greater risk of MACE. Late MVO is shown to be a stronger prognostic marker for MACE and cardiac death, recurrent MI, congestive heart failure/heart failure hospitalization, and follow-up LV end-systolic volumes than early MVO. IMH is associated with LV remodeling and MACE on pooled analysis, but because of limited data and heterogeneity in study methodology, the effects of IMH on remodeling require further investigation.","authors":["Yasmin S Hamirani","Andrew Wong","Christopher M.
