{"id":"222416067_Investigating_students'_perceived_satisfaction_behavioral_intention_and_effectiveness_of_e-learning_A_case_study_of_the_Blackboard_system","abstract":"Although the benefits of e-learning have been discussed in various previous studies; it is a critical issue of better understanding the reasons why some learners are dissatisfied with the e-learning experience. Therefore, this research investigates learners’ satisfaction, behavioral intentions, and the effectiveness of the Blackboard e-learning system. A total of 424 university students were surveyed using a standard questionnaire. The results showed that perceived self-efficacy is a critical factor that influences learners’ satisfaction with the Blackboard e-learning system. Perceived usefulness and perceived satisfaction both contribute to the learners’ behavioral intention to use the e-learning system. Furthermore, e-learning effectiveness can be influenced by multimedia instruction, interactive learning activities, and e-learning system quality. This research proposes a conceptual model for understanding learners’ satisfaction, behavioral intention, and effectiveness of using the e-learning system.","authors":["Shu-Sheng Liaw"],"meta":["September 2008Computers & Education 51(2):864-873","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.005","SourceDBLP"],"references":["291979640_Considerations_for_developing_constructivist_web-based_learning","240443908_Virtual_Interaction_Design_Factors_Affecting_Student_Satisfaction_and_Perceived_Learning_in_Asynchronous_Online_Courses","222650529_A_developmental_model_for_distance_learning_using_the_Internet","222407026_Instructional_video_in_e-learning_Assessing_the_impact_of_interactive_video_on_learning_effectiveness","220435681_Interaction_in_distance-learning_courses","200772846_Cognitive_Flexibility_Constructivism_and_Hypertext_Random_Access_Instruction_for_Advanced_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_Ill-Structured_Domains","44819841_The_Use_of_Information_Technology_to_Enhance_Management_School_Education_A_Theoretical_View","285775247_E-learning_growth_and_promise_for_the_developing_world","285294468_A_framework_for_designing_interactivity_into_web-based_instruction","247897833_The_Human_Touch_Synchronous_Communication_in_Web-Based_Learning","228796852_Projecting_stand_attributes_of_regrowth_ash_eucalypts_sampled_in_forest_inventory","228590396_How_do_online_students_differ_from_lecture_students","223529761_An_activity-theoretical_approach_to_investigate_learners'_factors_toward_e-learning_systems","223369244_Computers_and_the_Internet_as_a_job_assisted_tool_based_on_the_three-tier_use_model_approach","222406233_An_Internet_survey_for_perceptions_of_computers_and_the_World_Wide_Web","222300791_Assessment_of_learner_satisfaction_with_asynchronous_e-learning_systems","222219204_Multisectoral_partnerships_in_e-learning_A_potential_force_for_improved_human_capital_development_in_the_Asia_Pacific","220899164_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220421855_Constructivism_Teaching_for_Understanding_of_the_Internet"]}
