{"id":"319803252_International_Journal_of_Advance_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Management_Studies_Understanding_Natural_Language_Processing_and_its_Primary_Aspects","abstract":"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important feature of intelligent computer systems. It is the field of computer studies that focuses on the interaction between human languages and computers. It is an interdisciplinary subject which borrows extensively from different areas in computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. The aim of this article is to study the subject of Natural Language Processing in a brief manner and enlighten the reader on every basic aspect of this novel topic of research. The topics discussed in this article range from a study of the emergence of natural language processing as an important research objective for mankind to the various parsing techniques of natural languages and the future of this sub-field of computer artificial intelligence.","authors":["Anurag Roy","Ashin Guha Majumder","Asoke Nath"],"meta":["September 2017","Project: Understanding Natural Language Processing and its Primary Aspects"],"references":["3297963_Text_Document_Preprocessing_with_the_Bayes_Formula_for_Classification_Using_the_Support_Vector_Machine","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","220426816_ELIZA_-_A_Computer_Program_For_the_Study_of_Natural_Language_Communication_Between_Man_And_Machine_Reprint","220049445_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models","2985293_Cramming_More_Components_Onto_Integrated_Circuits"]}
