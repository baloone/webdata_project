{"id":"339565044_Discussao_da_Posicao_de_Calouras_de_Ciencia_da_Computacao","abstract":"The low participation of women in the computer's fields is a disturbing fact since diversity in any environment is vital to a good development, especially in technology where the role of end users is changing and they have gone from consumers to producers. This paper describes our project's activity at our university with the newly enrolled students in the Computer Science course in the last 3 semesters. Our goal is to analyze the interaction among students, especially girls, in the first days of school and promote a discussion about the low number of girls in the course, giving the opportunity for them to share their experiences.","authors":["Karina Mochetti","Raquel Bravo","Luciana Salgado","Carla Leit√£o"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.5753/wit.2017.3403","Conference: XI Women in Information Technology"],"references":[]}
