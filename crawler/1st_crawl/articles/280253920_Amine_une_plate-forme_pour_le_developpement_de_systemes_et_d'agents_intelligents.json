{"id":"280253920_Amine_une_plate-forme_pour_le_developpement_de_systemes_et_d'agents_intelligents","abstract":"This paper presents an overview of Amine ; a multi-layer and open-source platform, implemented in Java and dedicated to the development of intelligent systems and agents. Amine is composed of four layers : a) a kernel layer that enables the creation, edition, update and manipulation of multi-lingua ontologies, b) an algebraic layer that offers a set of elementary data types, structured types and various matching-based operations, c) a programming layer that provides three programming paradigms: i) an ontology or memory-based programming paradigm which is concerned by incremental and automatic integration of knowledge in an ontology (or agent memory), ii) a pattern-matching and rule-based programming paradigm, embedded in PROLOG+CG language, and iii) an activation and propagation-based programming paradigm, embedded in SYNERGY language, and d) an agent and multi-agent systems layer that enables the development of agent-based applications.","authors":["Karim Mohamed Bouzoubaa"],"meta":["October 2010"],"references":["280255305_Construction_et_manipulation_d'ontologies_multi-lingue_semantique_et_dynamique_dans_Amine_Platform","260383612_Amine_Platform_an_Artificial_Intelligence_Environment_For_the_Development_of_Intelligent_Systems","225070439_Knowledge_Representation_Logical_Philosophical_and_Computational_Foundations","221648993_Uses_Improvements_and_Extensions_of_PrologCG_Case_Studies","239025764_INFERENTIAL_THEORY_OF_LEARNING_Developing_Foundations_for_Multistrategy_Learning","225242338_Synergy_A_Conceptual_Graph_Activation-Based_Language"]}
