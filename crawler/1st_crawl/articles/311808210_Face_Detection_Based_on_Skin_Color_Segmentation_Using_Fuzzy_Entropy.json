{"id":"311808210_Face_Detection_Based_on_Skin_Color_Segmentation_Using_Fuzzy_Entropy","abstract":"Face detection is the first step of any automated face recognition system. One of the most popular approaches to detect faces in color images is using a skin color segmentation scheme, which in many cases needs a proper representation of color spaces to interpret image information. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy system for detecting skin in color images, so that each color tone is assumed to be a fuzzy set. RGB, HSV and YCbCr color systems are used for the development of our fuzzy design. Thus, a fuzzy 3-partition entropy approach is used to calculate all the parameters needed for the fuzzy systems and, then, a face detection method is also developed to validate the segmentation results. The results of the experiments show a correct skin detection rate between 94--96% for our fuzzy segmentation methods, with a false positive rate about 0.5% in all cases. Furthermore, the average correct face detection rate is above 93%, and even when working with heterogeneous backgrounds and different light conditions, it achieves almost 88% correct detections. Thus, our method leads to accurate face detection results with low false positive and false negative rates.","authors":["Francisco A.
