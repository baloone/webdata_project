{"id":"289706368_Effects_of_quasi-steady-state_reduction_on_biophysical_models_with_oscillations","abstract":"Many biophysical models have the property that some variables in the model evolve much faster than others. A common step in the analysis of such systems is to simplify the model by assuming that the fastest variables equilibrate instantaneously, an approach that is known as quasi-steady state reduction (QSSR). QSSR is intuitively satisfying but is not always mathematically justified, with problems known to arise, for instance, in some cases in which the full model has oscillatory solutions; in this case, the simplified version of the model may have significantly different dynamics to the full model.","authors":["Sebastian Boie","Vivien Kirk","James Sneyd","Martin Wechselberger"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Theoretical Biology 393:16-31","DOI:10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.011"],"references":["277671019_MATCONT","268997840_Multiple_Geometric_Viewpoints_of_Mixed_Mode_Dynamics_Associated_with_Pseudo-plateau_Bursting","259755597_A_propos_de_canards_Apropos_canards","316806869_Applied_Mathematical_Sciences","284894477_Xppaut","284681387_On_Different_Mechanisms_for_Membrane_Potential_Bursting","284648061_Biophys_J","267071213_Mathematical_physiology_I_Cellular_physiology_2nd_ed","266860819_The_singular_limit_of_a_Hopf_bifurcation","266678577_A_constructive_approach_to_quasi-steady_state_reductions"]}
