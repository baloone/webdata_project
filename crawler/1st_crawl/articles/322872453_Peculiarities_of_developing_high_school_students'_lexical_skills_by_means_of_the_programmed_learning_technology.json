{"id":"322872453_Peculiarities_of_developing_high_school_students'_lexical_skills_by_means_of_the_programmed_learning_technology","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to substantiate theoretically and to test experimentally the effectiveness of the programmed learning technology at the lessons of a foreign language to develop lexical skills of high school students. The article presents the authors’ fragments of lessons and sets of exercises with the use of programmed instruction at English classes in Grade 10 to develop students’ lexical skills. It is proved that on the stage of forming lexical skills it is viable to develop sets of exercises aimed at memorizing the word, its semantics in the unity with the pronunciation and grammatical form; forming meaningful word combinations with the use of multimedia tools. The authors also found that at the stage of mastering lexical skills it is necessary to do various creative tasks using the Internet. The study proved the effectiveness of the programmed learning technology for the development of students’ lexical skills. © 2018, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.
