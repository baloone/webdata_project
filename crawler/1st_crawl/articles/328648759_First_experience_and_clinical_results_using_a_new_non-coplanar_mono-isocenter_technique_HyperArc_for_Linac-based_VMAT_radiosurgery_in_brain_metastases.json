Aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SRS/SFRT for BMs, using a new mono-isocenter non-coplanar solution (HyperArc™ Varian Medical System).\n\nMethods\nBMs patients with a diameter inferior to 3 cm, a life expectancy of more than 3 months and a good performance status, were eligible for Linac-based volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) SFRT/SRS with HyperArc™. A retrospective analysis of patients and BMs was performed.\n\nResults\nFrom August 2017 to May 2018, 381 BMs in 64 patients were treated and 246 BMs (43 patients, median number of BMs: 5) of them were suitable for analysis. With a median FU time of 6 months, 244 out 246 (99%) BMs were controlled (18% complete response; 41% partial response, 40% stable disease), 2 BMs showed a progression, at the first control. No acute or late toxicities were reported. Median overall survival (OS) has not yet been achieved, while median time to progression was 5 months. In univariate analysis, statistically negative prognostic factors for OS were histology of primary tumor (p = 0.009): lung/breast cancer had better survival rates as compared to others. Cumulative intracranial volume disease ≥ 15 cc and systemic progression disease were independent prognostic factors for OS at univariate (p = 0.04; p = 0.005) and multivariate (p = 0.04; p = 0.009) analysis, respectively.\n\nConclusion\nThe present first clinical data show that SFRT/SRS with HyperArc™ is safe and effective for BMs patients. The utilization of SFRT/SRS for BMs is promising and should be further explored in randomized trials.","authors":["Filippo Alongi","Alba Fiorentino","Fabiana Gregucci","Stefanie Corradini"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology 145(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00432-018-2781-7","Project: Sbrt in all declinations"],"references":["327966194_Outcomes_following_SRS_for_small-_to_medium-sized_brain_metastases_are_exceptionally_dependent_upon_tumor_size_and_prescribed_dose","324545604_Genetic_heterogeneity_and_actionable_mutations_in_HER2-positive_primary_breast_cancers_and_their_brain_metastases","323566568_Linac-based_VMAT_radiosurgery_for_multiple_brain_lesions_Comparison_between_a_conventional_multi-isocenter_approach_and_a_new_dedicated_mono-isocenter_technique","316702707_Dabrafenib_plus_trametinib_versus_dabrafenib_monotherapy_in_patients_with_metastatic_BRAF_V600EK-mutant_melanoma_long-term_survival_and_safety_analysis_of_a_phase_3_study","321911539_Excellent_Outcomes_with_Radiosurgery_for_Multiple_Brain_Metastases_in_Oncogene-Addicted_Non-Small-Cell_Lung_Cancer","320006082_Hippocampal_dose_during_Linac-based_stereotactic_radiotherapy_for_brain_metastases_An_observational_study","319663872_Stereotactic_radiosurgery_alone_for_multiple_brain_metastases_A_review_of_clinical_and_technical_issues","318302550_Current_Challenges_in_the_Management_of_Breast_Cancer_Brain_Metastases","312654312_Management_of_Brain_Metastases_in_Tyrosine_Kinase_Inhibitor-Naive_Epidermal_Growth_Factor_Receptor-Mutant_Non-Small-Cell_Lung_Cancer_A_Retrospective_Multi-Institutional_Analysis","305664027_Effect_of_Radiosurgery_Alone_vs_Radiosurgery_With_Whole_Brain_Radiation_Therapy_on_Cognitive_Function_in_Patients_With_1_to_3_Brain_Metastases_A_Randomized_Clinical_Trial","305349479_Comparative_effectiveness_of_stereotactic_radiosurgery_versus_whole-brain_radiation_therapy_for_patients_with_brain_metastases_from_breast_or_non-small_cell_lung_cancer","303556982_RECIST_11_-_Standardisation_and_disease-specific_adaptations_Perspectives_from_the_RECIST_Working_Group","303319837_Stereotactic_radiosurgery_for_intracranial_metastases_Linac-based_and_gamma-dedicated_unit_approach","288286113_Comparative_Effectiveness_of_Stereotactic_Radiosurgery_SRS_Versus_Whole_Brain_Radiation_Therapy_WBRT_for_Patients_With_Brain_Metastases_From_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_NSCLC","281304187_Long-term_risk_of_radionecrosis_and_imaging_changes_after_stereotactic_radiosurgery_for_brain_metastases"]}
