{"id":"323950352_Highly_cited_articles_in_wind_tunnel-related_research_a_bibliometric_analysis","abstract":"Wind tunnels have been widely employed in aerodynamic research. To characterize the high impact research, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on highly cited articles related to wind tunnel based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database from 1900 to 2014. Articles with at least 100 citations from the Web of Science Core Collection were selected and analyzed in terms of publication years, authors, institutions, countries/territories, journals, Web of Science categories, and citation life cycles. The results show that a total of 77 highly cited articles in 37 journals were published between 1959 and 2008. Journal of Fluid Mechanics published the most of highly cited articles. The USA was the most productive country and most frequent partner of internationally collaboration. The prolific institutions were mainly located in the USA and UK. The authors who were both first author and corresponding author published 88% of the articles. The Y index was also deployed to evaluate the publication characteristics of authors. Moreover, the articles with high citations in both history and the latest year with their citation life cycles were examined to provide insights for high impact research. The highly cited articles were almost earliest wind tunnel experimental data and reports on their own research specialty, and thus attracted high citations. It was revealed that classic works of wind tunnel research was frequently occurred in 1990s but much less in 2000s, probably due to the development of numerical models of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) in recent decades.","authors":["Ziwei Mo","Hui-Zhen Fu","Yuh-Shan Ho"],"meta":["June 2018Environmental Science and Pollution Research 25(16)","DOI:10.1007/s11356-018-1766-z"],"references":["285599405_On_the_onset_of_High_Reynolds_Number_Grid-Generated_Wind_Tunnel_Turbulence","280802281_Coherent_Eddies_and_Turbulence_in_Vegetation_Canopies_The_Mixing-Layer_Analogy","277516796_A_family_of_vortex_wakes_generated_by_a_thrush_nightingale_in_free_flight_in_a_wind_tunnel_over_its_entire_natural_range_of_flight_speeds","314816170_Large_eddy_simulation_of_flow_around_an_airfoil_near_stall","314814642_Aerodynamic_flow_control_over_an_unconventional_airfoil_using_synthetic_jet_actuators","303914364_Comparison_of_environmental_laws_publications_in_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_and_Social_Science_Index_a_bibliometric_analysis","296833765_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_highly_cited_articles_in_materials_science","284695822_Keywords_plus-ISIS_breakthrough_retrieval_method_1_Expanding_your_searching_power_on_current-contents_on_diskette","280323692_Air_Side_Performance_of_Brazed_Aluminum_Heat_Exchangers","278165300_A_Bibliometric_Study_of_Highly_Cited_Reviews_in_the_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_TM","276414720_Highly_cited_articles_in_biomass_research_A_bibliometric_analysis","276255961_Top_cited_articles_in_thermodynamic_research","274996386_Top_cited_articles_in_adsorption_research_using_Y-index","268558399_An_Overview_of_the_NASA_Aeronautics_Test_Program_Strategic_Plan","266747025_Highly_Cited_Articles_in_Health_Care_Sciences_and_Services_Field_in_Science_Citation_Index_Expanded_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_for_1958-2012"]}
