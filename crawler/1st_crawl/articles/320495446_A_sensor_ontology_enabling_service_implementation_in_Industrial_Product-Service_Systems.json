{"id":"320495446_A_sensor_ontology_enabling_service_implementation_in_Industrial_Product-Service_Systems","abstract":"By adapting Industrial Product Service System (IPSS), OEMs have to improve their competency of service providing. To do so, they need to improve their ability of information capturing from the whole life cycle of IPSS. They make it possible by integrating CPS components to their product and providing necessary infrastructure. Such integration process is a collaborative and knowledge-intensive process, involving several actors and tools. In this paper, sensor ontology is proposed as a part of common knowledge repository to support semantic interoperability between involved actors and tools besides to provide engineers the necessary knowledge to reuse facilities during the IPSS design. Using inputs from literature, sensor domain ontologies are extracted and extended to consider the connection with different aspect of the PSS in the Industry.","authors":["Elaheh Maleki","Farouk Belkadi","Berend Jan van der Zwaag","Alain Bernard"],"meta":["July 2017IFAC-PapersOnLine 50(1):13059-13064","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2005","Project: ICP4Life (Horizon 2020)"],"references":["316818001_PSS_Pattern_Concept_for_Knowledge_Representation_in_Design_Process_of_Industrial_Product-service_Systems","306426761_Cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","295084306_Introducing_Functional_Products_in_Production_Systems_Problems_and_Issues_Encountered","284096376_The_Functional_Products_Technical_Lifecycle_and_its_Four_Sub-lifecycles","277352237_The_Impact_of_Cyber-physical_Systems_on_Industrial_Services_in_Manufacturing","273876044_Modular_Sensor_Platform_for_Service-oriented_Cyber-Physical_Systems_in_the_European_Tool_Making_Industry","256092056_The_SSN_Ontology_of_the_W3C_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Incubator_Group","229307646_ONTO-PDM_Product-driven_ONTOlogy_for_Product_Data_Management_interoperability_within_manufacturing_process_environment","274417405_Through-Life_Engineering_Services","256688210_OntoSTEP_Enriching_product_model_data_using_ontologies"]}
