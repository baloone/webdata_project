{"id":"344236455_Hybrid_Nanofluid_Flow_Past_a_Shrinking_Cylinder_with_Prescribed_Surface_Heat_Flux","abstract":"This numerical study was devoted to examining the occurrence of non-unique solutions in boundary layer flow due to deformable surfaces (cylinder and flat plate) with the imposition of prescribed surface heat flux. The hybrid Al 2 O 3-Cu/water nanofluid was formulated using the single phase model with respective correlations of hybrid nanofluids. The governing model was simplified by adopting a similarity transformation. The transformed differential equations were then numerically computed using the efficient bvp4c solver with the ranges of the control parameters 0.5% ≤ φ 1 , φ 2 ≤ 1.5% (Al 2 O 3 and Cu volumetric concentration), 0 ≤ K ≤ 0.2 (curvature parameter), 2.6 < S ≤ 3.2 (suction parameter) and −2.5 < λ ≤ 0.5 (stretching/shrinking parameter). Dual steady solutions are presentable for both a cylinder (K > 0) and a flat plate (K = 0) with the inclusion of only the suction (transpiration) parameter. The real and stable solutions were mathematically validated through the stability analysis. The Al 2 O 3-Cu/water nanofluid with φ 1 = 0.5% (alumina) and φ 2 = 1.5% (copper) has the highest skin friction coefficient and heat transfer rate, followed by the hybrid nanofluids with volumetric concentrations (φ 1 = 1%, φ 2 = 1%) and (φ 1 = 1.5%, φ 2 = 0.5%), respectively. Surprisingly, the flat plate surface abates the separation of boundary layer while it enhances the heat transfer process.","authors":["Najiyah Safwa Khashi'ie","Iskandar Waini","Nurul Amira Zainal","Khairum Hamzah"],"meta":["September 2020Symmetry 12(9):1493","DOI:10.3390/sym12091493","Project: Hybrid Nanofluid flow and heat transfer"],"references":["341925040_Flow_and_heat_transfer_past_a_permeable_power-law_deformable_plate_with_orthogonal_shear_in_a_hybrid_nanofluid","341913159_Mixed_Convective_Stagnation_Point_Flow_towards_a_Vertical_Riga_Plate_in_Hybrid_Cu-Al2O3Water_Nanofluid","341877623_Squeezed_Hybrid_Nanofluid_Flow_Over_a_Permeable_Sensor_Surface","341344430_Unsteady_Three-Dimensional_MHD_Non-_Axisymmetric_Homann_Stagnation_Point_Flow_of_a_Hybrid_Nanofluid_with_Stability_Analysis","341315478_Flow_and_heat_transfer_of_hybrid_nanofluid_over_a_permeable_shrinking_cylinder_with_Joule_heating_A_comparative_analysis","355756474_Mathematical_model_of_simultaneous_flow_between_casson_fluid_and_dust_particle_over_a_vertical_stretching_sheet","343934548_Homogeneous-heterogeneous_reaction_mechanism_on_MHD_carbon_nanotube_flow_over_a_stretching_cylinder_with_prescribed_heat_flux_using_differential_transform_method","342621753_Dufour_and_Soret_effects_on_Al_2_O_3_-water_nanofluid_flow_over_a_moving_thin_needle_Tiwari_and_Das_model","342594342_MHD_flow_and_heat_transfer_of_hybrid_nanofluid_over_a_permeable_moving_surface_in_the_presence_of_thermal_radiation","341677859_MHD_mixed_convection_stagnation_point_flow_of_a_hybrid_nanofluid_past_a_vertical_flat_plate_with_convective_boundary_condition","340704663_Hybrid_Nanofluid_Flow_Past_a_Permeable_Moving_Thin_Needle","338336753_Stability_Analysis_and_Dual_Solutions_of_Micropolar_Nanofluid_over_the_Inclined_StretchingShrinking_Surface_with_Convective_Boundary_Condition","337579833_Mixed_Convective_Flow_and_Heat_Transfer_of_a_Dual_Stratified_Micropolar_Fluid_Induced_by_a_Permeable_StretchingShrinking_Sheet","339204506_The_Investigation_of_a_Fluid-Solid_Interaction_Mathematical_Model_under_Combined_Convective_Jeffrey_Flow_and_Radiation_Effect_Embedded_Newtonian_Heating_as_the_Thermal_Boundary_Condition_over_a_Vertic","338184741_Hybrid_nanofluid_flow_induced_by_an_exponentially_shrinking_sheet"]}
