{"id":"304896110_Understanding_the_acoustics_of_Papal_Basilicas_in_Rome_by_means_of_a_coupled-volumes_approach","abstract":"The paper investigates the acoustics of the World-famous four Papal Basilicas in Rome, namely Saint Peter, St. John Lateran, St. Paul outside the Walls, and Saint Mary Major. They are characterized by different dimensions, materials, and architectural features, as well as by a certain number of similarities. In addition, their complexity determines significant variation in the acoustics depending on the relative position of source and receivers. A detailed set of acoustic measures was carried out in each church, using both spatial (B-format) and binaural microphones, and determining the standard ISO 3382 descriptors. Results are analyzed in relation to the architectural features, pointing out the differences observed in terms of listening experience. Finally, in order to explain some of the results found among energy-based parameters, churches were analyzed as a system of acoustically coupled volumes. The latter explained most of the anomalies observed in the distribution of acoustic parameters, while showing at the same time that secondary spaces (aisles, chapels) play a different role depending on the amount of sound absorption located into the main nave.","authors":["Francesco Martellotta"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Sound and Vibration 382:413-427","DOI:10.1016/j.jsv.2016.07.007"],"references":["265794853_Virtual_restoration_of_the_sound_of_the_Hispanic_Rite","262853383_Acoustic_Pots_in_Ancient_and_Medieval_Buildings_Literary_Analysis_of_Ancient_Texts_and_Comparison_with_Recent_Observations_in_French_Churches","306152766_Acoustic_properties_of_the_selected_churches_in_Poland","271239683_Worship_Space_Acoustics","270567602_A_geometrical_acoustic_simulation_of_the_effect_of_occupancy_and_source_position_in_historical_churches","269962710_Virtual_Acoustic_Reconstruction_of_the_Church_at_the_Lost_Monastery_of_Santa_Maria_de_la_Murta","263858174_Measurement_of_intelligibility_and_clarity_of_the_speech_in_Romanesque_churches","262853307_Acoustics_Liturgy_and_Architecture_in_the_Early_Christian_Church_From_the_domus_ecclesiae_to_the_basilica","262020390_Acoustical_study_of_Toledo_Cathedral_according_to_its_liturgical_uses","259126776_A_methodology_for_the_study_of_the_acoustic_environment_of_Catholic_cathedrals_Application_to_the_Cathedral_of_Malaga"]}
