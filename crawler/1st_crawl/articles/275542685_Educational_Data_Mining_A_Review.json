{"id":"275542685_Educational_Data_Mining_A_Review","abstract":"Data Mining is very useful in the field of education especially when examining studentsâ€™ learning behavior in online learning environment. This is due to the potential of data mining in analyzing and uncovering the hidden information of the data itself which is hard and very time consuming if to be done manually. The purpose of this review is to look into how the data mining was tackled by previous scholars and the latest trends on data mining in educational research. Several limitations of existing research are discussed and some directions for future research are suggested.","authors":["Siti khadijah Mohamad","Zaidatun Tasir"],"meta":["November 2013Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 97","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.240"],"references":["289657906_Drawbacks_and_solutions_of_applying_association_rule_mining_in_learning_management_systems","242282475_What_is_Collaborative_Learning","228947797_Revisiting_interestingness_of_strong_symmetric_association_rules_in_educational_data","313060524_Clustering_and_sequential_pattern_mining_of_online_collaborative_learning_data","285852296_Data_mining_for_education","265110855_A_complete_understanding_of_disorientation_problems_in_web-based_learning","257253047_Examining_Students'_Online_Interaction_in_a_Live_Video_Streaming_Environment_Using_Data_Mining_and_Text_Mining","256918729_A_web-based_intelligent_report_e-learning_system_using_data_mining_techniques","256309431_The_State_of_Educational_Data_Mining_in_2009_A_Review_and_Future_Visions","249233503_Using_Web_Server_Logs_in_Evaluating_Instructional_Web_Sites"]}
