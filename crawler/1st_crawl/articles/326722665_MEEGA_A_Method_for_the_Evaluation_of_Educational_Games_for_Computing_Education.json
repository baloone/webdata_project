{"id":"326722665_MEEGA_A_Method_for_the_Evaluation_of_Educational_Games_for_Computing_Education","abstract":"Educational games are assumed to be an effective and efficient instructional strategy for computing education. However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence on their quality. A prominent evaluation model is MEEGA (Model for the Evaluation of Educational Games) providing a support to evaluate games in terms of motivation, user experience and learning. However, analyses of the initial version of the MEEGA model have identified limitations regarding its validity and reliability. Furthermore, a more comprehensive support is required in order to guide instructors and/or researchers in how to conduct game evaluations in order to obtain reliable and valid results. Thus, the ob-jective of this technical report is to present the MEEGA+ method, which aims to evaluate the quality of educational games used as instructional strategy for computing education, improv-ing the initial version of the MEEGA model. The MEEGA+ method has been developed tak-ing also into consideration results from a systematic literature review on the evaluation of ed-ucational games. The MEEGA+ method is composed by the quality model, defining quality factors to be evaluated through a standardized measurement instrument, and defines the process to evaluate the quality of educational games used for computing education using the MEEGA+ model. The MEEGA+ method provides game creators, instructors and researchers with a systematic support in order to evaluate the quality of educational games and, thus, contribute to their improvement and effective and efficient adoption in practice.","authors":["Giani Petri","Christiane Gresse von Wangenheim","Adriano Ferreti Borgatto"],"meta":["July 2018","Report number: INCoD/GQS.05.2018.E","Project: Evaluation of Educational Games for Computing Education"],"references":["322632031_Trends_of_Serious_Games_Research_from_2007_to_2017_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","322397502_Realidade_Aumentada_em_Geografia_uma_atividade_de_orientacao_no_ensino_fundamental","321887742_Game_Elements_for_Learning_Programming_A_Mapping_Study","321654583_State_of_the_art_in_Game_Based_Learning_Dimensions_for_Evaluating_Educational_Games","314091894_Digital_card_games_in_education_A_ten_year_systematic_review","318413746_CHEMIS3_A_game_for_learning_chemical_concepts_through_elements_of_nature","317468694_Fundamentos_da_teoria_da_resposta_ao_item_TRI","313843178_A_Large-Scale_Evaluation_of_a_Model_for_the_Evaluation_of_Games_for_Teaching_Software_Engineering","313555682_Evaluating_the_Effectiveness_of_Learning_Interventions_An_Information_Systems_Case_Study","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology"]}
