{"id":"313419746_A_classification_methodology_for_security_patterns_to_help_fix_software_weaknesses","abstract":"Security patterns are generic solutions that can be\napplied since early stages of software life to overcome recurrent\nsecurity weaknesses. Their generic nature and growing number\nmake their choice difficult, even for experts in system design. To\nhelp them on the pattern choice, this paper proposes a semi-\nautomatic methodology of classification and the classification\nitself, which exposes relationships among software weaknesses,\nsecurity principles and security patterns. It expresses which\npatterns remove a given weakness with respect to the security\nprinciples that have to be addressed to fix the weakness. The\nmethodology is based on seven steps, which anatomize patterns\nand weaknesses into set of more precise sub-properties that\nare associated through a hierarchical organization of security\nprinciples. These steps provide the detailed justifications of\nthe resulting classification and allow its upgrade. Without loss\nof generality, this classification has been established for Web\napplications and covers 185 software weaknesses, 26 security\npatterns and 66 security principles.","authors":["Loukmen Regainia","Sébastien Salva","Cédric Bouhours"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945693","Conference: 13th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications AICCSA 2016At: Agadir, Morocco"],"references":["268018467_Attack-defense_trees","261338535_A_Comparative_Study_of_Software_Security_Pattern_Classifications","258762161_Organizing_Security_Patterns_Related_to_Security_and_Pattern_Recognition_Requirements","242679421_A_system_of_security_patterns","234756109_Towards_a_structured_unified_process_for_software_security","221240558_Classifying_Security_Patterns","289901069_Vulnerability-Based_Security_Pattern_Categorization_in_Search_of_Missing_Patterns","254041559_Does_organizing_security_patterns_focus_architectural_choices","246438387_Improving_Web_Application_Security_Threats_and_Countermeasures","242520787_Building_Secure_Software_How_to_Avoid_Security_Problems_the_Right_Way"]}
