{"id":"345959032_Gamification-based_e-learning_Platform_for_Computer_Programming_Education","abstract":"In this paper a novel design of an e-learning platform is proposed, aimed at programming education for groups of students. The platform is conceived as open-source software and its main technological design goal is to reduce its requirements on server-side resources. On the educational level it makes use of a number of gamification concepts, which are expected to increase students' engagement in learning by not only awarding individual work but also stimulating students, on different occasions, for both immediate rivalry and team work.","authors":["Jakub Swacha","Pawel Baszuro"],"meta":["June 2013","Conference: X World Conference on Computers in EducationAt: Toru≈Ñ, Poland","Project: New approaches to programming education"],"references":["261174332_Automated_Assessment_of_Programming_Assignments_Visual_Feedback_Assignment_Mobility_and_Assessment_of_Students'_Testing_Skills","258697764_Gamification_in_Education_What_How_Why_Bother","234611318_Integrating_an_Automatic_Judge_into_an_Open_Source_LMS","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","230822093_Teaching_Programming_and_Algorithm_Design_with_Pythia_a_Web-Based_Learning_Platform","224169973_E-Assessment_as_a_Service","262294706_Online_python_tutor_Embeddable_web-based_program_visualization_for_cs_education","262042566_AUTOMATED_GRADING_AND_FEEDBACK_PROVIDING_ASSIGNMENTS_MANAGEMENT_MODULE","261311953_New_concepts_for_teaching_computer_programming_to_future_Information_Technology_engineers","260587274_Automated_Assessment_in_a_Programming_Tools_Course"]}
