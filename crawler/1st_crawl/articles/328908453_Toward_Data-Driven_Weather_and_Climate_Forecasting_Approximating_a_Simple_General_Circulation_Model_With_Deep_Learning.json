{"id":"328908453_Toward_Data-Driven_Weather_and_Climate_Forecasting_Approximating_a_Simple_General_Circulation_Model_With_Deep_Learning","abstract":"It is shown that it is possible to emulate the dynamics of a simple general circulation model with a deep neural network. After being trained on the model, the network can predict the complete model state several time steps aheadâ€”which conceptually is making weather forecasts in the model world. Additionally, after being initialized with an arbitrary model state, the network can through repeatedly feeding back its predictions into its inputs create a climate run, which has similar climate statistics to the climate of the general circulation model. This network climate run shows no long-term drift, even though no conservation properties were explicitly designed into the network.","authors":["Sebastian Scher"],"meta":["November 2018Geophysical Research Letters 45(10)","DOI:10.1029/2018GL080704"],"references":["343695591_Deep_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","328264084_Predicting_Weather_Forecast_Uncertainty_with_Machine_Learning","328014115_Challenges_and_design_choices_for_global_weather_and_climate_models_based_on_machine_learning","327487681_Deep_learning_to_represent_subgrid_processes_in_climate_models","326043857_Challenges_and_design_choices_for_global_weather_and_climate_models_based_on_machine_learning","323335153_Data-Driven_Forecasting_of_High-Dimensional_Chaotic_Systems_with_Long-Short_Term_Memory_Networks","324617987_Machine_Learning_Predictions_of_a_Multi-Resolution_Climate_Model_Ensemble","322277018_Tensorflow_Large-scale_machine_learning_on_heterogeneous_distributed_systems","320971059_Geometric_Deep_Learning_on_Graphs_and_Manifolds_Using_Mixture_Model_CNNs","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks"]}
