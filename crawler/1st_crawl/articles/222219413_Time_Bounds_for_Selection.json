{"id":"222219413_Time_Bounds_for_Selection","abstract":"The number of comparisons required to select the i-th smallest of n numbers is shown to be at most a linear function of n by analysis of a new selection algorithmâ€”PICK. Specifically, no more than 5.4305 n comparisons are ever required. This bound is improved for extreme values of i, and a new lower bound on the requisite number of comparisons is also proved.","authors":["Manuel Blum","Robert W.
