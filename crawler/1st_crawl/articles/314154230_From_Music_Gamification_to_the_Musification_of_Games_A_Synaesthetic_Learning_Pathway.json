{"id":"314154230_From_Music_Gamification_to_the_Musification_of_Games_A_Synaesthetic_Learning_Pathway","abstract":"Similar to the music investment of movies is the composition of audio effects and music for the escalating industry of video gaming. Gamification has been endorsed as an interdisciplinary factor for promoting entertainment along constructivist learning. As a result, the production of music for games has been promoted as a state-of-the-art research field in computer science. Apart from its business sense it also provides a developmental journey that promotes sets of different expectations and attracts new groups of vendors. Since the production of games is characterized by maximum activity in terms of complication and cost (the production of a 3-D multiplayer game can sum up to millions of dollars), the role of sound engineer/composer/programmer becomes crucial. This research describes how sound investment can endow stimulating musical compositions. State of the art systems and techniques that develop algorithmic music composition for this specific audiovisual activity are analyzed.","authors":["Dionysios Politis","Dimitrios Margounakis","Veljko AleksiÄ‡","Nikolaos Karanikas"],"meta":["February 2017","Project: Music and Games"],"references":["301776392_Psychometric_evaluation_of_the_reliability_of_IPVIS-OS_multiple_intelligences_assessment_instrument_for_early_adolescents","262357618_Image_to_sound_transforms_and_sound_to_image_visualizations_based_on_the_chromaticism_of_music","259973011_Technologies_for_foreign_language_learning_A_review_of_technology_types_and_their_effectiveness","258105716_Learning_by_Playing_and_Learning_by_Making","287895305_Algorithmic_music_as_intelligent_game_music","273947281_The_gamification_of_learning_and_instruction_Game-based_methods_and_strategies_for_training_and_education_San_Francisco_CA_Pfeiffer","271937664_Using_Games_and_Simulations_for_Supporting_Learning","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","270699454_Enriching_Archaeological_Parks_with_Contextual_Sounds_and_Mobile_Technology","242684825_Gaming_Literacy_Game_Design_as_a_Model_for_Literacy_in_the_Twenty-First_Century"]}
