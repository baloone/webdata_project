{"id":"281947314_The_Higgs_Machine_Learning_Challenge","abstract":"The Higgs boson machine learning challenge has been set up to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data used by physicists to optimize the analysis of the Higgs boson. The Challenge is organized by a small group of ATLAS physicists and data scientists. It has been hosted by Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson; the\nchallenge data is now available on https://opendata.cern.ch/education/ATLAS.\nThe original document provided the scientific and technical background for the Challenge. It has been minimally modified to serve as a permanent\ndocumentation for the corresponding dataset permanently available from opendata.cern.ch","authors":["David Rousseau","Claire Adam-Bourdarios","Glen Cowan","Cecile Germain"],"meta":["May 2015Journal of Physics Conference Series 664(7)","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/664/7/072015"],"references":["243685542_Kendall''s_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","238885792_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","45928545_Erratum_to_Asymptotic_formulae_for_likelihood-based_tests_of_new_physics","39001148_Kendall's_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics_Volume_1_Distribution_Theory"]}
