{"id":"352830730_IPG_as_a_new_method_to_improve_the_agility_of_the_initial_analysis_of_the_inventive_design","abstract":"TRIZ method has long proven its value without appearing to the industrial world as inevitable. Design researchers have therefore addressed the limitations of the TRIZ method and have overcome them with more systematic approaches. Among these, the Inventive Design Method (IDM) has been the subject of several articles and put into practice in the industry. It is considered an improvement over TRIZ but still suffers from some drawbacks in terms of the time-consuming nature of its implementation. We focused on the IDM process by trying to both identify its areas of inefficiencies while attempting to preserve the quality of its deliverables. Our approach consists of applying the precepts of Lean to IDM. The result is the Inverse Problem Graph (IPG) method, inspired by IDM, but offering significant progress in reducing the time required to mobilize experts while preserving its inventive outcomes. This article outlines our approach for the construction of this new method.","authors":["Masih Hanifi","Hicham Chibane","R.
