{"id":"334816391_Synchronous_at_Scale_Investigation_and_Implementation_of_a_Semi-Synchronous_Online_Lecture_Platform","abstract":"Online classes and degree programs continue to grow in popularity, in part due to the increased convenience and accessibility of education that technology has provided in recent years. As online education scales upwards and outwards, there is an increased need to provide students with an engaging and collaborative learning experience. In some online learning environments, student collaboration is perceived to be more difficult than it is in a physical classroom setting due to cultural or geographic distance between students. In particular, online class lectures often lack the collaborative spirit seen in most in-person classroom lectures. To improve upon the online classroom experience, this project first examines the benefits and drawbacks of several in-person and online lecture delivery techniques, then proposes an online lecture platform that allows students to facilitate their own collaborative classrooms on-demand through a semi-synchronous viewing area and chatroom.","authors":["Denise G.
