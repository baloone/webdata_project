We show that the minimum is unique and has the value , as was conjectured by Stanley. The minimizing function f0, , is given parametrically by (2)for 0 ⩽ x ⩽ 2; and f0(x) = 0 for x ⩾ 2. Closely related unpublished results have been obtained by Hammersley. We also find the minimum of H(f) subject to the constraints f(0) ⩽ a and f−1(0) = inf(x:f(x) = 0) ⩽b where a and b are given. Proofs of the results for the case of constraints are complicated and will be given elsewhere. Let λn be the shape of the random Young tableau with n unit squares obtained from sampling from the Schensted distribution where (3)where π(λn) is the product of the n hook lengths of λn. Consider the stochastic processes (4)where λn(t) is the height of the tableau λn at a horizontal distance t from the corner. We show in the sense of weak convergence in a certain metric, where f0 is the deterministic function in (2).Let l(σn) denote the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation σn of 1,2,…,n. Hammersley showed that (6)Schensted showed that l(σn) has the same distribution as λn(0) under the distribution (3) on λn. It has long been conjectured (apparently first by Baer and Brock) that c = 2. We show here that c ⩾ 2 as a by-product of (5).","authors":["B.F Logan","Lawrence Alan Shepp"],"meta":["November 1977Advances in Mathematics 26(2):206-222","DOI:10.1016/0001-8708(77)90030-5"],"references":["321308973_Natural_sorting_over_permutation_spaces","315232436_Characters_of_the_symmetric_groups_of_degree_15_and_16","302174239_Longest_increasing_and_decreasing_subsequences_Canad","255352668_Characters_of_the_symmetric_groups_of_degree_15_and_16","248885298_The_Theory_of_Group_Characters_and_Matrix_Representations_of_Groups_Second_Edition","246922694_Natural_Sorting_Over_Permutation_Spaces","245340668_An_Extension_of_Schensted's_Theorem","242921281_The_Largest_Degrees_of_Irreducible_Characters_of_the_Symmetric_Group","239398456_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers_Fifth_Edn","239063303_The_Hook_Graphs_of_the_Symmetric_Group","239063199_A_few_seedlings_of_research","230595873_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","220026735_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Fourier_Integrals","38362645_Subadditive_Ergodic_Theory"]}
