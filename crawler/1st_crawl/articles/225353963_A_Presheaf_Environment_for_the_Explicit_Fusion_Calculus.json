{"id":"225353963_A_Presheaf_Environment_for_the_Explicit_Fusion_Calculus","abstract":"Name passing calculi are nowadays one of the preferred formalisms for the specification of concurrent and distributed systems\nwith a dynamically evolving topology. Despite their widespread adoption as a theoretical tool, though, they still face some\nunresolved semantic issues, since the standard operational, denotational and logical methods often proved inadequate to reason\nabout these formalisms. A domain which has been successfully employed for languages with asymmetric communication, like the\nπ-calculus, are presheaf categories based on (injective) relabellings, such as \n\nSet\\mathbbISet^{\\mathbb{I}}. Calculi with symmetric binding, in the spirit of the fusion calculus, give rise to novel research challenges. In this work we examine the explicit fusion calculus, and propose to model its syntax and semantics using the presheaf category \n\nSet\\mathbbESet^\\mathbb{E}, where \n\n\\mathbbE\\mathbb{E} is the category of equivalence relations and equivalence preserving morphisms.\n\nKeywordsAlgebras–Coalgebras–Denotational semantics–Nominal calculi–Presheaf categories","authors":["Filippo Bonchi","Maria Grazia Buscemi","Vincenzo Ciancia","Fabio Gadducci"],"meta":["August 2012Journal of Automated Reasoning 49(2):1-23","DOI:10.1007/s10817-011-9224-3"],"references":["237107559_Towards_a_Mathematical_Semantics_for_Computer_Languages","319394405_Toward_a_Mathematical_Semantics_for_Computer_Languages","277296934_Universal_Coalgebra_a_Theory_of_Systems","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","262206069_Semantics_of_Name_and_Value_Passing","261042292_Fully-abstract_model_for_the_p-calculus","242914081_A_theory_of_bisimulation_for_the_p-calculus","234812536_Relating_coalgebraic_notions_of_bisimulation_with_applications_to_name-passing_process_calculi","225265074_Strong_Bisimulation_for_the_Explicit_Fusion_Calculus","225128456_Deriving_Bisimulation_Congruences_for_Reactive_Systems","222835045_Families_of_Symmetries_as_Efficient_Models_of_Resource_Binding","222709698_Relationally_Staged_Computations_in_Calculi_of_Mobile_Processes","225120327_Pseudo-distributive_laws_and_axiomatics_for_variable_binding","222840479_Universal_coalgebra_A_theory_of_systems","222673392_Category_theory_for_operational_semantics"]}
