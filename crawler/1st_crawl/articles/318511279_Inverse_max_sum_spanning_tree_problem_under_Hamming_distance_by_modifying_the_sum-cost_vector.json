{"id":"318511279_Inverse_max_sum_spanning_tree_problem_under_Hamming_distance_by_modifying_the_sum-cost_vector","abstract":"The inverse max \\(+\\) sum spanning tree (MSST) problem is considered by modifying the sum-cost vector under the Hamming Distance. On an undirected network G(V, E, w, c), a weight w(e) and a cost c(e) are prescribed for each edge \\(e\\in E\\). The MSST problem is to find a spanning tree \\(T^*\\) which makes the combined weight \\(\\max _{e\\in T}w(e)+\\sum _{e\\in T}c(e)\\) as small as possible. It can be solved in \\(O(m\\log n)\\) time, where \\(m:=|E|\\) and \\(n:=|V|\\). Whereas, in an inverse MSST problem, a given spanning tree \\(T_0\\) of G is not an optimal MSST. The sum-cost vector c is to be modified to \\(\\bar{c}\\) so that \\(T_0\\) becomes an optimal MSST of the new network \\(G(V,E,w,\\bar{c})\\) and the cost \\(\\Vert \\bar{c}-c\\Vert \\) can be minimized under Hamming Distance. First, we present a mathematical model for the inverse MSST problem and a method to check the feasibility. Then, under the weighted bottleneck-type Hamming distance, we design a binary search algorithm whose time complexity is \\(O(m log^2 n)\\). Next, under the unit sum-type Hamming distance, which is also called \\(l_0\\) norm, we show that the inverse MSST problem (denoted by IMSST\\(_0\\)) is \\(NP-\\)hard. Assuming \\({\\textit{NP}} \\nsubseteq {\\textit{DTIME}}(m^{{\\textit{poly}} \\log m})\\), the problem IMSST\\(_0\\) is not approximable within a factor of \\(2^{\\log ^{1-\\varepsilon } m}\\), for any \\(\\varepsilon >0\\). Finally, We consider the augmented problem of IMSST\\(_0\\) (denoted by AIMSST\\(_0\\)), whose objective function is to multiply the \\(l_0\\) norm \\(\\Vert \\beta \\Vert _0\\) by a sufficiently large number M plus the \\(l_1\\) norm \\(\\Vert \\beta \\Vert _1\\). We show that the augmented problem and the \\(l_1\\) norm problem have the same Lagrange dual problems. Therefore, the \\(l_1\\) norm problem is the best convex relaxation (in terms of Lagrangian duality) of the augmented problem AIMSST\\(_0\\), which has the same optimal solution as that of the inverse problem IMSST\\(_0\\).","authors":["Xiucui Guan","Xinyan He","Panos Pardalos","Zhang Binwu"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Global Optimization 69(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10898-017-0546-5","Project: inverse max+sum optimization problems"],"references":["318161406_Inverse_maxsum_spanning_tree_problem_under_weighted_l_1_l_1_norm_by_modifying_the_sum-cost_vector","279022559_Inverse_Max_plus_Sum_spanning_tree_problem_by_modifying_the_sum-cost_vector_under_weighted_linfinityNorm","251312713_Inverse_1-median_problem_on_trees_under_weighted_Hamming_distance","227333991_Some_inverse_min-max_network_problems_under_weighted_l_1_and_l_norms_with_bound_constraints_on_changes","260360166_ell_0-system_gain_and_ell_1-optimal_control","245753544_Computers_and_In_stractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness_W_H_Freeman_San_Fran","234840230_Minimum_deviation_and_balanced_optimization_A_unified_approach","230596652_Solving_Inverse_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Through_Network_Flow_Techniques","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","226358366_Solving_combinatorial_problems_with_combined_Min-Max-Min-Sum_objective_and_applications"]}
