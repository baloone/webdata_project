The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.","authors":["Ferhat Ucar","Deniz Korkmaz"],"meta":["April 2020Medical Hypotheses 140(July 2020):109761","DOI:10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109761"],"references":["346521704_COVID-Net_a_tailored_deep_convolutional_neural_network_design_for_detection_of_COVID-19_cases_from_chest_X-ray_images","343094700_Can_AI_help_in_screening_Viral_and_COVID-19_pneumonia","342508556_A_Deep_Learning_System_to_Screen_Novel_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_Pneumonia","340365814_Insight_into_2019_novel_coronavirus_-_An_updated_interim_review_and_lessons_from_SARS-CoV_and_MERS-CoV","340043598_Recognizing_Multiple_Types_of_Rocks_Quickly_and_Accurately_Based_on_Lightweight_CNNs_Model","339112553_Clinical_Characteristics_of_138_Hospitalized_Patients_With_2019_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China","335948996_RobNet_real-time_road-object_3D_point_cloud_segmentation_based_on_SqueezeNet_and_cyclic_CRF","320442366_A_systematic_study_of_the_class_imbalance_problem_in_convolutional_neural_networks","301878495_SqueezeNet_AlexNet-level_accuracy_with_50x_fewer_parameters_and_05MB_model_size","288060170_Recent_Advances_in_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","344354855_COVID-CAPS_A_capsule_network-based_framework_for_identification_of_COVID-19_cases_from_X-ray_images","340168195_Routine_childhood_immunization_may_protect_against_COVID-19","339908066_Squeeze-and-Excitation_SqueezeNext_An_Efficient_DNN_for_Hardware_Deployment","339772818_Positive_rate_of_RT-PCR_detection_of_SARS-CoV-2_infection_in_4880_cases_from_one_hospital_in_Wuhan_China_from_Jan_to_Feb_2020","339707234_Coronavirus_disease_2019_COVID-19_Role_of_chest_CT_in_diagnosis_and_management","339332106_A_deep_learning_algorithm_using_CT_images_to_screen_for_Corona_Virus_Disease_COVID-19","339316654_Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2_SARS-CoV-2_and_coronavirus_disease-2019_COVID-19_The_epidemic_and_the_challenges","339128296_Molecular_Diagnosis_of_a_Novel_Coronavirus_2019-nCoV_Causing_an_Outbreak_of_Pneumonia","338956445_Automatic_sleep_stage_classification_using_time-frequency_images_of_CWT_and_transfer_learning_using_convolution_neural_network","338828160_EEG_based_multi-class_seizure_type_classification_using_convolutional_neural_network_and_transfer_learning","336633609_Application_of_convolutional_neural_networks_featuring_Bayesian_optimization_for_landslide_susceptibility_assessment","336627614_Pneumonia_Detection_Using_CNN_based_Feature_Extraction","336558196_An_Expert_System_for_Brain_Tumor_Detection_Fuzzy_C-Means_with_Super_Resolution_and_Convolutional_Neural_Network_with_Extreme_Learning_Machine","336425412_DCCMED-Net_Densely_Connected_and_Concatenated_Multi_Encoder-Decoder_CNNs_for_Retinal_Vessel_Extraction_from_Fundus_Images","334670648_Fault_Diagnosis_of_High-Speed_Train_Bogie_by_Residual-Squeeze_Net","332557186_Hyperparameter_optimization_for_machine_learning_models_based_on_Bayesian_optimization","323373904_Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses_and_Treatable_Diseases_by_Image-Based_Deep_Learning","318192987_On_the_Bayes_Methods_for_Seeking_the_Extremal_Point","316443493_Deep_Learning_at_Chest_Radiography_Automated_Classification_of_Pulmonary_Tuberculosis_by_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
