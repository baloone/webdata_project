{"id":"266960317_On_a_12_conjecture","abstract":"Let us assign positive integers to the edges and vertices of a simple graph G. As a result we obtain a vertex-colouring of G with integers, where a vertex colour is simply a sum of the weight assigned to the vertex itself and the weights of its incident edges. Can we obtain a proper colouring using only weights 1 and 2 for an arbitrary G? We give a positive answer when G is a 3-colourable, complete or 4-regular graph. We also show that it is enough to use weights from 1 to 11, as well as from 1 to ⌊χ(G)/2⌋+1, for an arbitrary graph G.","authors":["Jakub Przybyło","Mariusz Woźniak"],"meta":["January 2010Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 12(1)"],"references":[]}
