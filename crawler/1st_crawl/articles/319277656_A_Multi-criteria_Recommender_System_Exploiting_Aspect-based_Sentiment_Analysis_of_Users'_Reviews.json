{"id":"319277656_A_Multi-criteria_Recommender_System_Exploiting_Aspect-based_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Users'_Reviews","abstract":"In this paper we propose a multi-criteria recommender system based on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, which exploits the information conveyed by users' reviews to provide a multi-faceted representation of users' interests.\nTo this end, we exploited a framework for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which automatically extracts relevant aspects and sentiment scores from users' reviews. As an example, in a restaurant recommendation scenario, the aspects may regard food quality, service, position, athmosphere of the place and so on. Such a multi-faceted representation of the user is used to feed a multi-criteria CF algorithm which predicts user interest in a particular item and provides her with recommendations.\nIn the experimental session we evaluated the performance of the algorithm against several state-of-the-art baselines; Results confirmed the insight behind this work, since our approach was able to overcome both single-criteria recommendation algorithms as well as more sophisticated techniques based on matrix factorization.","authors":["Cataldo Musto","Marco de Gemmis","Giovanni Semeraro","Pasquale Lops"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3109859.3109905","Conference: the Eleventh ACM Conference"],"references":["313575510_Sweetprolog_A_system_to_integrate_ontologies_and_rules","287871786_A_comparison_of_lexicon-based_approaches_for_sentiment_analysis_of_microblog","273915499_Augmenting_service_recommender_systems_by_incorporating_contextual_opinions_from_user_reviews","273285927_Recommender_systems_based_on_user_reviews_the_state_of_the_art","266412729_Multi-criteria_Ratings_for_Recommender_Systems_An_Empirical_Analysis_in_the_Tourism_Domain","257632073_Combining_user_preferences_and_user_opinions_for_accurate_recommendation","241623236_Accuracy_improvements_for_multi-criteria_recommender_systems","221343179_SweetProlog_A_System_to_Integrate_Ontologies_and_Rules","220788980_Large-Scale_Parallel_Collaborative_Filtering_for_the_Netflix_Prize","220360470_Experimental_Analysis_of_Design_Choices_in_multiattribute_Utility_Collaborative_Filtering","51951195_HOGWILD_A_Lock-Free_Approach_to_Parallelizing_Stochastic_GradientDescent","50378498_A_new_ANEW_Evaluation_of_a_word_list_for_sentiment_analysis_inmicroblogs","2903412_A_Language_Model_Approach_to_Keyphrase_Extraction","308960424_SABRE_A_sentiment_aspect-based_retrieval_engine","308953917_Amazon_com_recommendations_Item-to-item_collaborative_filtering","301388825_Rival","300575054_User_Preference_Learning_with_Multiple_Information_Fusion_for_Restaurant_Recommendation","300572451_Combining_Distributional_Semantics_and_Entity_Linking_for_Context-Aware_Content-Based_Recommendation","284039049_Recursive_deep_models_for_semantic_compositionality_over_a_sentiment_treebank","281943993_An_investigation_on_the_serendipity_problem_in_recommender_systems","241596612_Learning_Preference_Models_in_Recommender_Systems","226204259_Multi-Criteria_Recommender_Systems","221141063_Multi-criteria_service_recommendation_based_on_user_criteria_preferences","3454465_New_Recommendation_Techniques_for_Multicriteria_Rating_Systems","3419552_Linden_G_Smith_B_and_York_J_'Amazoncom_recommendations_item-to-item_collaborative_filtering'_Internet_Comput_IEEE_7"]}
