{"id":"285270806_A_Computational_Model_for_Amodal_Completion","abstract":"This paper presents a computational model to recover the most likely\ninterpretation of the 3D scene structure from a planar image, where some\nobjects may occlude others. The estimated scene interpretation is obtained by\nintegrating some global and local cues and provides both the complete\ndisoccluded objects that form the scene and their ordering according to depth.\nOur method first computes several distal scenes which are compatible with the\nproximal planar image. To compute these different hypothesized scenes, we\npropose a perceptually inspired object disocclusion method, which works by\nminimizing the Euler's elastica as well as by incorporating the relatability of\npartially occluded contours and the convexity of the disoccluded objects. Then,\nto estimate the preferred scene we rely on a Bayesian model and define\nprobabilities taking into account the global complexity of the objects in the\nhypothesized scenes as well as the effort of bringing these objects in their\nrelative position in the planar image, which is also measured by an Euler's\nelastica-based quantity. The model is illustrated with numerical experiments\non, both, synthetic and real images showing the ability of our model to\nreconstruct the occluded objects and the preferred perceptual order among them.\nWe also present results on images of the Berkeley dataset with provided\nfigure-ground ground-truth labeling.","authors":["Maria Oliver Parera","Gloria Haro","Mariella Dimiccoli","Baptiste Mazin"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 56(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0652-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["292943489_Computing_an_Exact_Gaussian_Scale-Space","289374511_Structural_information_theory_The_simplicity_of_visual_form","279348491_LSD_A_line_segment_detector","274375484_Illusory_Shapes_via_Corner_Fusion","282304247_Contour_Completion_of_Partly_Occluded_Skew-Symmetry_Objects","281981556_A_sourcebook_of_gestalt_psychology_Kapitel_Laws_of_organization_in_perceptual_forms","281542446_Modal_and_amodal_shape_completion","281519872_Differentiating_Local_and_Global_Processes_in_Amodal_Completion_Through_Dot_Localization","272048634_Amodal_completion_Simplicity_is_not_the_explanation","266505724_Semicontinuity_and_relaxation_properties_of_a_curvature_depending_functional_in_2D"]}
