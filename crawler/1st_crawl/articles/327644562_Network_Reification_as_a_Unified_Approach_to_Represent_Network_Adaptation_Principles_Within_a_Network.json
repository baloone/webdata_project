{"id":"327644562_Network_Reification_as_a_Unified_Approach_to_Represent_Network_Adaptation_Principles_Within_a_Network","abstract":"In this paper the notion of network reification is introduced: a construction by which a given (base) network is extended by adding explicit states representing the characteristics defining the base network's structure. Having the network structure represented in an explicit manner within the extended network enhances expressiveness and enables to model adaptation of the base network by dynamics within the reified network. It is shown how the approach provides a unified modeling perspective on representing network adaptation principles across different domains. This is illustrated by a number of known network adaptation principles such as for Hebbian learning in Mental Networks and for network evolution based on homophily in Social Networks.","authors":["Jan Treur"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-04070-3_27","Conference: 7th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Natural Computing, TPNC'18Volume: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer Publishers","Project: Self-Modeling Networks and their Applications"],"references":["328875364_An_Adaptive_Temporal-Causal_Network_Model_for_Decision_Making_Under_Acute_Stress","325391914_The_Ins_and_Outs_of_Network-Oriented_Modeling_From_Biological_Networks_and_Mental_Networks_to_Social_Networks_and_Beyond","313791285_On_the_Applicability_of_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Based_on_Temporal-Causal_Networks_Why_Network_Models_Do_Not_Just_Model_Networks","307990137_A_Temporal-Causal_Modelling_Approach_to_Integrated_Contagion_and_Network_Change_in_Social_Networks","305930006_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Addressing_Complexity_of_Cognitive_Affective_and_Social_Interactions","303996475_A_Temporal-Causal_Modelling_Approach_to_Integrated_Contagion_and_Network_Change_in_Social_Networks","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","279870651_The_Incompleteness_Theorems","271880695_Disconnection_and_reconnection_The_morphological_basis_of_maladaptation_to_stress","261589943_Models_for_Network_Evolution"]}
