{"id":"318504274_How_to_make_the_most_of_your_human_design_considerations_for_human-machine_interactions","abstract":"Reconsidering the function allocation between automation and the pilot in the flight deck is the next step in improving aviation safety. The current allocation, based on who does what best, makes poor use of the pilot’s resources and abilities. In some cases, it may actually handicap pilots from performing their role. Improving pilot performance first lies in defining the role of the pilot—why a human is needed in the first place. The next step is allocating functions based on the needs of that role (rather than fitness), and then using automation to target specific human weaknesses in performing that role. Examples are provided (some of which could be implemented in conventional cockpits now). Along the way, the definition of human error and the idea that eliminating/automating the pilot will reduce instances of human error will be challenged.","authors":["Paul Schutte"],"meta":["September 2017Cognition Technology and Work 19(6)","DOI:10.1007/s10111-017-0418-2"],"references":["270960170_Automation_surprises","267402671_Decomposing_Automation_Apparent_Simplicity_Real_Complexity","264622301_Exploring_the_Impact_of_API_Complexity_on_Failure-Proneness","319770455_Naturalistic_Decision_Making","304996013_Synergistic_Allocation_of_Flight_Expertise_on_the_Flight_Deck_SAFEdeck_A_Design_Concept_to_Combat_Mode_Confusion_Complacency_and_Skill_Loss_in_the_Flight_Deck","291279612_Crew_Resource_Management","276036095_Lessons_Learned_from_the_787_Dreamliner_Issue_on_Lithium-Ion_Battery_Reliability","267403286_Stress_Cognition_and_Human_Performance_A_Literature_Review_and_Conceptual_Framework","261669540_Higher_and_Lower_Needs","260135131_The_Recognition-Primed_Decision_RPD_Model_Looking_Back_Looking_Forward","258138719_How_in_the_World_Did_We_Ever_Get_into_That_Mode_Mode_Error_and_Awareness_in_Supervisory_Control","243767675_Cockpit_interruptions_and_distractions_Effective_management_requires_a_careful_balancing_act","247154057_The_Effectiveness_of_Airline_Pilot_Training_for_Abnormal_Events","246922908_Naturalistic_decision_making_Where_are_we_now","246866100_Monitoring_of_Automated_Systems"]}
