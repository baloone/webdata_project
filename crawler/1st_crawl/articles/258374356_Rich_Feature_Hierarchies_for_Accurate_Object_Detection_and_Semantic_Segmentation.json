{"id":"258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","abstract":"Can a large convolutional neural network trained for whole-image\nclassification on ImageNet be coaxed into detecting objects in PASCAL? We show\nthat the answer is yes, and that the resulting system is simple, scalable, and\nboosts mean average precision, relative to the venerable deformable part model,\nby more than 40% (achieving a final mAP of 48% on VOC 2007). Our framework\ncombines powerful computer vision techniques for generating bottom-up region\nproposals with recent advances in learning high-capacity convolutional neural\nnetworks. We call the resulting system R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. The\nsame framework is also competitive with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nmethods, demonstrating its flexibility. Beyond these results, we execute a\nbattery of experiments that provide insight into what the network learns to\nrepresent, revealing a rich hierarchy of discriminative and often semantically\nmeaningful features.","authors":["Ross Girshick","Jeff Donahue","Trevor Darrell","Jitendra Malik"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2014.81","SourcearXiv"],"references":["307562031_Visualizing_Object_Detection_Features","289917319_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_object_detection","267686145_Do_We_Need_More_Training_Data_or_Better_Models_for_Object_Detection","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition","261493845_Bottom-Up_Segmentation_for_Top-Down_Detection","260350533_Semantic_Segmentation_with_Second-Order_Pooling","240308781_Learning_Hierarchical_Features_for_Scene_Labeling","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","221364881_Neural_Network-Based_Face_Detection","221362642_Boosted_local_structured_HOG-LBP_for_object_localization","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221110937_Segmentation_as_selective_search_for_object_recognition","220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_challenge","51855547_CPMC_Automatic_Object_Segmentation_Using_Constrained_Parametric_Min-Cuts","48412209_Evaluation_of_GIST_descriptors_for_web-scale_image_search","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","271551071_Regionlets_for_Generic_Object_Detection","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","266089888_Object_Detection_with_Grammar_Models","262397182_Diagnosing_Error_in_Object_Detectors","261493954_Histograms_of_Sparse_Codes_for_Object_Detection","261263537_Sketch_Tokens_A_Learned_Mid-level_Representation_for_Contour_and_Object_Detection","261121676_A_data_driven_method_for_feature_transformation","260432401_Mitosis_Detection_in_Breast_Cancer_Histology_Images_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","244706524_Fast_Accurate_Detection_of_100000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine","243743707_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","237417270_Discriminatively_Trained_Mixtures_of_Deformable_Part_Models","233950915_Semantic_segmentation_using_regions_and_parts","233815499_Pedestrian_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Multi-Stage_Feature_Learning","232626819_Recognition_using_regions","224135925_Multiple_Kernels_for_Object_Detection","221750789_Measuring_the_Objectness_of_Image_Windows","221305422_Category_Independent_Object_Proposals","221111477_Semantic_contours_from_inverse_detectors","221110727_Adaptive_Deconvolutional_Networks_for_Mid_and_High_Level_Feature_Learning","221110114_Poselets_Body_Part_Detectors_Trained_Using_3D_Human_Pose_Annotations","220660299_Modeling_the_Shape_of_the_Scene_A_Holistic_Representation_of_the_Spatial_Envelope","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition","216792834_Original_approach_for_the_localisation_of_objects_in_images","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models","15829465_Neocognitron_A_self-organizing_neural_network_model_for_a_mechanism_of_pattern_recognition_unaffected_by_shift_in_position"]}
