{"id":"334579724_Syntax-based_Improvements_to_Plagiarism_Detectors_and_their_Evaluations","abstract":"Software plagiarism cheats students out of their own education and leads to unfair grading, making software plagiarism detection an important problem. However, many popular plagiarism detection tools are inaccurate, language-specific, or closed source, limiting their applicability. In this work, we seek to address these problems via a novel approach. We adapt the optimal Smith-Waterman sequence alignment algorithm to precisely measure the similarity between programs, greatly improving detection accuracy relative to competitors. Our approach is applicable to any language describable by an ANTLR grammar, which includes most programming languages. We also provide a new type of evaluation based on random program generation and obfuscation. Finally, we make our approach freely available, allowing for customizations and transparent reasoning about detection behavior.","authors":["Lawton Nichols","Kyle Dewey","Mehmet Emre","Sitao Chen"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3304221.3319789","Conference: the 2019 ACM Conference"],"references":["311912240_WASTK_An_Weighted_Abstract_Syntax_Tree_Kernel_Method_for_Source_Code_Plagiarism_Detection","268185911_The_truth_of_the_F-measure","261430885_Source_code_plagiarism_detection_and_performance_analysis_using_fingerprint_based_distance_measure_method","221219530_Syntax_tree_fingerprinting_for_source_code_similarity_detection","221214940_Winnowing_Local_Algorithms_for_Document_Fingerprinting","36451198_JPlag_finding_plagiarisms_among_a_set_of_programs","2840981_Winnowing_Local_Algorithms_for_Document_Fingerprinting","2832828_Finding_Plagiarisms_among_a_Set_of_Programs_with_JPlag","346695369_Sim_a_utility_for_detecting_similarity_in_computer_programs","327807480_ES-Plag_Efficient_and_sensitive_source_code_plagiarism_detection_tool_for_academic_environment","326918072_Automated_Plagiarism_Detection_for_Computer_Programming_Exercises_Based_on_Patterns_of_Resubmission","324053884_X9_An_Obfuscation_Resilient_Approach_for_Source_Code_Plagiarism_Detection_in_Virtual_Learning_Environments","289304036_AST-Based_Plagiarism_Detection_Method","286609799_Plagiarism_detection_A_tool_survey_and_comparison","271495549_AST-based_multi-language_plagiarism_detection_method","227650341_ANTLR_A_predicated-LLk_parser_generator","221419653_Program_Plagiarism_Detection_Using_Parse_Tree_Kernels","31104285_PDetect_A_Clustering_Approach_for_Detecting_Plagiarism_in_Source_Code_Datasets","15934339_Identification_of_Common_Molecular_Subsequences"]}
