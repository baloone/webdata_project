{"id":"220296928_On_the_Bent_Boolean_Functions_That_are_Symmetric","abstract":"Bent functions are the boolean functions having the maximal possible Hamming distance from the linear boolean functions. Bent functions were introduced and first studied by O. S. Rothaus in 1976.We prove that there are exactly four symmetric bent functions on every even number of variables. These functions are exactly the four symmetric quadratic polynomials of the given number of variables.","authors":["Petr Savick√Ω"],"meta":["July 1994European Journal of Combinatorics 15(4):407-410","DOI:10.1006/eujc.1994.1044","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220533161_Harmonic_Analysis_of_Polynomial_Threshold_Functions","256391988_On_bent_functions","3083846_The_covering_radius_of_the_Reed-Muller_code_is_at_least_16276","3083358_The_covering_radius_of_the_1288_Reed-Muller_code_is_56_Corresp"]}
