{"id":"333152148_Data_Analysis_of_Multivariate_Time_Series_of_Insect_Tracking","abstract":"Tracking animals using transmitters is a busy research branch in zoology. In this paper, we study the effect of a temperature and transmitter’s weight on a field cricket’s movement. We recorded the movement of 180 field crickets with a 4K camera and the captured movies were analyzed by a novel tracking algorithm based on a soft-computing technique called F-transform. The resulting data have a character of multivariate time series and we show how descriptive statistics, linear regression, linguistic fuzzy rules, and random forests might be used for analyzing such data.","authors":["Pavel Rusnok","Petr Hurtik","Oto Kaláb","David Musiolek"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2018.00128","Conference: 2018 Joint 10th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (SCIS) and 19th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (ISIS)"],"references":["311899453_Terrestrial_animal_tracking_as_an_eye_on_life_and_planet","291355077_Linguistic_Fuzzy_Logic_in_R","288920424_Image_reduction_method_based_on_the_F-transform","288543224_Observation_of_movement_and_activity_via_radio-telemetry_reveals_diurnal_behavior_of_the_neotropical_katydid_philophyllia_ingens_Orthoptera_Tettigoniidae","228451484_Classification_and_Regression_by_RandomForest","51866277_Tracking-Learning-Detection","6590345_Going_wild_What_a_global_small-animal_tracking_system_could_do_for_experimental_biologists","328082467_Software_for_Visual_Insect_Tracking_Based_on_F-transform_Pattern_Matching","313916289_Insight_into_Fuzzy_Modeling","312371270_Real-Time_Tracking_via_on-Line_Boosting","308072753_Regression_analysis_based_on_linguistic_associations_and_Perception-based_Logical_Deduction","302930173_Insight_into_Fuzzy_Modeling","286593879_Adaptive_Color_Attributes_for_Real-Time_Visual_Tracking","267989574_Applied_Predictive_Modeling","261154953_Visual_tracking_with_online_Multiple_Instance_Learning","257597650_Challenges_and_prospects_in_the_telemetry_of_insects","223634138_Fuzzy_transforms_Theory_and_applications","220932702_Forward-Backward_Error_Automatic_Detection_of_Tracking_Failures","220063693_On_the_semantics_of_perception-based_fuzzy_logic_deduction","3431793_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Strong_Tracking_Extended_Kalman_Filtering_for_GPS_Navigation"]}
