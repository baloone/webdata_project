{"id":"279273719_Open_Source_Engineering_Processes","abstract":"Software engineering in open source projects faces similar challenges as in traditional software development (coordination of and cooperation between contributors, change and release management, quality assurance, â€¦), but often uses different means of solving them. This leads to some salient distinctions between both worlds, especially with respect to communication and how technical issues are addressed. The variations within open source software (OSS) communities are considerable, and many different approaches are currently in use, ranging from informal conventions to highly systematic, formally specified and rigidly applied processes. We discuss the archetypal best practises in the field, illustrate them by presenting example projects, and provide a comparison to traditional approaches.","authors":["Wolfgang Mauerer","Michael C.
