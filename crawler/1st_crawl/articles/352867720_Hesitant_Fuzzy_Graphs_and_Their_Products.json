{"id":"352867720_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Graphs_and_Their_Products","abstract":"In this article, the notion of hesitant fuzzy graph is introduced. It an extended structure of a fuzzy graph that gives more precision, flexibility and compatibility to a system when compared with the system that is designed using fuzzy graphs. Several operations on hesitant fuzzy graphs are defined, namely Cartesian product, composition, tensor product and normal product. Furthermore, the relationship between the degree of vertices of the hesitant fuzzy graphs and the hesitant fuzzy graph obtained by their different products is developed. These operations are highly used in computer science, geometry, algebra, operations research, etc.","authors":["Muhammad Javaid","Agha Kashif Arshad Khan","Tabasam Rashid"],"meta":["April 2020Fuzzy Information and Engineering 12(2):238-252","DOI:10.1080/16168658.2020.1817658"],"references":["311712471_Trapezoidal_fuzzy_multi-number_and_its_application_to_multi-criteria_decision-making_problems","347505087_Graph_Theory_and_Its_Applications","337226189_Bipolar_FPSS-tsheory_with_applications_in_decision_making","336569848_A_TOPSIS_method_by_using_generalized_trapezoidal_hesitant_fuzzy_numbers_and_application_to_a_robot_selection_problem","330936920_Novel_decision-making_approach_based_on_hesitant_fuzzy_sets_and_graph_theory","329794396_Graph_Theory_and_Its_Applications","329574958_Hesitant_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_applications_in_decision_making","326689366_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Graph_and_Its_Application_to_Multi-attribute_Decision_Making","324494913_Hesitant_fuzzy_connected_and_hesitant_fuzzy_trees","314302632_Partial_orderings_for_hesitant_fuzzy_sets","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","283005097_On_some_operations_and_density_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","280067281_Some_Results_on_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
