{"id":"223148537_PerAc_A_neural_architecture_to_control_artificial_animals","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new neural architecture called PerAc witch is a systematic way to decompose the control of an autonomous robot in perception and action flows. The PerAc architecture is used for the simulation of a vision system with a moving eye and then for landmark-based navigation on a mobile robot to learn without any a priori symbolic representation.","authors":["Philippe Gaussier","St√©phane Zrehen"],"meta":["December 1995Robotics and Autonomous Systems 16(2):291-320","DOI:10.1016/0921-8890(95)00052-6","SourceDBLP","Project: Modelling visual navigation, path integration, planning and timing prediction"],"references":["319393728_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem","313529390_Eye_movements_and_visual_percention","285439959_Qualitative_navigation","284635335_A_proposed_model_of_the_hippocampal-cortical_memory_system_and_temporal_pattern_sensitivity_of_LTP_in_hippocampal_neurons","279435353_Honey_Bee_Learning","274540332_A_Study_of_Instinct","273233521_Bright_Air_Brilliant_Fire_On_the_Matter_of_the_Mind","272746346_Life_Cognition_The_Epistemological_and_Ontological_Significance_of_Artificial_Life","262399666_1994_Special_Issue_A_model_of_hippocampal_function","247162040_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem"]}
