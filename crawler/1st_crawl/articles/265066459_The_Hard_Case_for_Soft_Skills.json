{"id":"265066459_The_Hard_Case_for_Soft_Skills","abstract":"About five years ago, Annie McKee, managing director of the Center for Professional Development at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was meeting with the executive board of a Fortune 50 financial-services firm. The topic? A proposed leadership-development program for the company's senior executives. Just as McKee finished explaining how the program would work and what skills would be developed, one board member jumped to his feet and started pounding his fists on the table. \"This program sounds fine,\" he said. \"But how do we teach our executives to trust one another?\" McKee was startled. \"This wasn't the kind of place where you'd expect to find much tolerance for any discussion about emotion, but that was exactly what was happening,\" she says. Intuitively, this board member recognized that if the company were to be successful, its most senior leaders would not only need the right knowledge and experience, but they'd also have to be skilled at the softer side of management. Since that time, McKee has seen a dramatic change in the response of corporate executives to the notion of soft skills. \"They're starting to get it,\" she says --and it's about time. Companies have offered soft-skills training to employees for years. But as every battle-scarred trainer knows, these programs are typically the first to go when budgets are cut. Given a choice between funding a course on computer skills or a course on active listening, corporate bean counters more willingly sign off on the computer course. Why? Because until recently, there had been no hard evidence that soft skills make a difference.","authors":["Shari Caudron"],"meta":["January 1999The Personnel journal 78(7)"],"references":[]}
