{"id":"51464892_The_use_of_CADCAM_in_dentistry","abstract":"Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) have become an increasingly popular part of dentistry over the past 25 years. The technology, which is used in both the dental laboratory and the dental office, can be applied to inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns, fixed partial dentures, implant abutments, and even full-mouth reconstruction. This article discusses the history of CAD/CAM in dentistry and gives an overview of how it works. It also provides information on the advantages and disadvantages, describes the main products available, discusses how to incorporate the new technology into your practice, and addresses future applications.","authors":["Gary Davidowitz","Philip G Kotick"],"meta":["July 2011Dental Clinics of North America 55(3):559-70, ix","DOI:10.1016/j.cden.2011.02.011","SourcePubMed"],"references":["236342957_3D_Digital_Scanners_A_High-Tech_Approach_to_More_Accurate_Dental_Impressions","41120586_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Clinical_Performance_of_CADCAM_Single-Tooth_Restorations","5278341_A_comparison_of_fixed_prostheses_generated_from_conventional_vs_digitally_scanned_dental_impressions","44696859_Dentistry_a_la_carte_in-office_CADCAM_technology","21377452_CADCAM_imaging_in_dentistry","20400333_Chairside_computeraided_direct_inlays","20097055_CAD-CAM_in_dentistry","19842901_Computer-aided_design_and_manufacturing_in_dentistry_A_review_of_the_state_of_the_art","14384146_Accuracy_of_machine_milling_and_spark_erosion_with_a_CADCAM_system","7918139_The_state_of_fixed_prosthodontic_impressions_Room_for_improvement","7635784_Virtual-Designed_and_Computer-Milled_Implant_Abutments","6838905_The_evolution_of_the_CEREC_system"]}
