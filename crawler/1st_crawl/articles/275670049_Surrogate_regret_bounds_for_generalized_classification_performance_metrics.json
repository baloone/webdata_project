{"id":"275670049_Surrogate_regret_bounds_for_generalized_classification_performance_metrics","abstract":"We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary\nclassification by means of surrogate loss. We focus on a class of metrics,\nwhich are linear-fractional functions of the false positive and false negative\nrates (examples of which include $F_{\\beta}$-measure, Jaccard similarity\ncoefficient, AM measure, and many others). Our analysis concerns the following\ntwo-step procedure. First, a real-valued function $f$ is learned by minimizing\na surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample. It is\nassumed that the surrogate loss is a strongly proper composite loss function\n(examples of which include logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss,\netc.). Then, given $f$, a threshold $\\hat{\\theta}$ is tuned on a separate\nvalidation sample, by direct optimization of the target performance measure. We\nshow that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding\n$f$ on $\\hat{\\theta}$) measured with respect to the target metric is\nupperbounded by the regret of $f$ measured with respect to the surrogate loss.\nOur finding is further analyzed in a computational study on both synthetic and\nreal data sets.","authors":["Wojciech Kotłowski","Krzysztof Dembczyński"],"meta":["April 2017Machine Learning 106(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10994-016-5591-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313755920_Evaluating_and_optimizing_autonomous_text_classification_systems","313418906_Bayes_optimal_multilabel_classification_via_probabilistic_classifier_chains","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","306157345_Submodular_Multi-Label_Learning","289725154_Optimizing_the_F-measure_in_multi-label_classification_Plug-in_rule_approach_versus_structured_loss_minimization","288616344_Consistent_binary_classification_with_generalized_performance_metrics","288613340_On_the_statistical_consistency_of_plug-in_classifiers_for_non-decomposable_performance_measures","288613160_On_the_statistical_consistency_of_algorithms_for_binary_classification_under_class_imbalance","281911082_On_the_Bayes-Optimality_of_F-Measure_Maximizers","281694954_Optimizing_F-Measures_by_Cost-Sensitive_Classification"]}
