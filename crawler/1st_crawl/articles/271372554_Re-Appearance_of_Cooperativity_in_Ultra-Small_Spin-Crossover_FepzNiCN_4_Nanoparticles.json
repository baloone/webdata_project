{"id":"271372554_Re-Appearance_of_Cooperativity_in_Ultra-Small_Spin-Crossover_FepzNiCN_4_Nanoparticles","abstract":"A reverse nanoemulsion technique was used for the elaboration of [Fe(pz){Ni(CN)4}] nanoparticles. Low-temperature micellar exchange made it possible to elaborate ultra-small nanoparticles with sizes down to 2 nm. When decreasing the size of the particles from 110 to 12 nm the spin transition shifts to lower temperatures, becomes gradual, and the hysteresis shrinks. On the other hand, a re-opening of the hysteresis was observed for smaller (2 nm) particles. A detailed 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis was used to correlate this unusual phenomenon to the modification of the stiffness of the nanoparticles thanks to the determination of their Debye temperature.","authors":["Haonan Peng","Simon Tricard","Gautier Félix","Gábor Molnár"],"meta":["August 2014Angewandte Chemie International Edition 53(41):10894","DOI:10.1002/anie.201406710"],"references":["260811117_Finite_size_effects_in_molecular_spin_crossover_materials","260759310_Non-extensivity_of_thermodynamics_at_the_nanoscale_in_molecular_spin_crossover_materials_A_balance_between_surface_and_volume","258086218_Enhanced_Cooperative_Interactions_at_the_Nanoscale_in_Spin-Crossover_Materials_with_a_First-Order_Phase_Transition","243426932_Two-dimensional_Ising-like_model_with_specific_edge_effects_for_spin-crossover_nanoparticles_A_Monte_Carlo_study","317836626_Mossbauer_Spectroscopy","264761344_Spin_Crossover_at_the_Nanometre_Scale","258865256_Mossbauer_Spectroscopy","258015273_Interplay_between_elastic_interactions_in_a_core-shell_model_for_spin-crossover_nanoparticles","235554877_Thermal_hysteresis_in_spin-crossover_compounds_studied_within_the_mechanoelastic_model_and_its_potential_application_to_nanoparticles","229573033_Spin-Crossover_Nanocrystals_with_Magnetic_Optical_and_Structural_Bistability_Near_Room_Temperature","225646599_A_simple_formula_for_the_thickness_correction_of_symmetrical_mossbauer_doublets_Application_to_spin_cross-over_systems","225283089_Status_and_perspectives_in_thin_films_and_patterning_of_spin_crossover_compounds","51099940_Molecular_spin_crossover_phenomenon_Recent_achievements_and_prospects","23268315_Towards_the_Ultimate_Size_Limit_of_the_Memory_Effect_in_Spin-Crossover_Solids","11876363_Cooperative_Spin_Crossover_Behavior_in_Cyanide-Bridged_FeII-MII_Bimetallic_3D_Hofmann-like_Networks_M_Ni_Pd_and_Pt","7684208_Thermal_hysteresis_loop_of_the_spin-state_in_nanoparticles_of_transition_metal_complexes_Monte_Carlo_simulations_on_an_Ising-like_model","5261914_Spin-Crossover_Coordination_Nanoparticles","5227717_Spin-Crossover_Nanocrystals_with_Magnetic_Optical_and_Structural_Bistability_Near_Room_Temperature"]}
