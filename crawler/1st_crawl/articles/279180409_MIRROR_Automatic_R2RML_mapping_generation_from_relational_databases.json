{"id":"279180409_MIRROR_Automatic_R2RML_mapping_generation_from_relational_databases","abstract":"Two W3C recommendations exist for the transformation of RDB content into RDF: Direct Mapping (DM) and R2RML. The DM recommendation specifies the set of fixed transformation rules, whilst R2RML allows customising them. Here we describe the MIRROR system, which generates two sets of R2RML mappings. First, it creates a set of mappings that allow any R2RML engine to generate a set of RDF triples homomorphic to the ones that a DM engine would generate (they only differentiate in the URIs used). This allows R2RML engines to exhibit a similar behaviour to that of DM engines. Second, it produces an additional set of R2RML mappings that allow generating triples resulting from the implicit knowledge encoded in relational database schemas, such as subclass-of and M-N relationships. We demonstrate the behaviour of MIRROR using the W3C DM Test Case together with an extended version of one of its databases.","authors":["Luciano F de Medeiros","Freddy Priyatna","Oscar Corcho"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19890-3_21","Conference: 15th Internacional Congress of Web EngineeringAt: RotterdamVolume: 9114"],"references":["281530857_xR2RML_Relational_and_Non-Relational_Databases_to_RDF_Mapping_Language","264458232_Specifying_Complex_Correspondences_between_Relational_Schemas_and_RDF_Models_for_Generating_Customized_R2RML_Mappings","261961018_Formalisation_and_experiences_of_R2RML-based_SPARQL_to_SQL_query_translation_using_morph","228837475_D2R_Server_-_Publishing_Relational_Databases_on_the_Semantic_Web","221664724_On_Directly_Mapping_Relational_Databases_to_RDF_and_OWL_ExtendedVersion","221023344_Triplify_-_Light-weight_Linked_Data_publication_from_relational_databases","220254334_Survey_of_directly_mapping_SQL_databases_to_the_Semantic_Web","49911492_R2O_an_Extensible_and_Semantically_based_Database-to-Ontology_Mapping_Language","291223515_OBDA_Query_Rewriting_or_Materialization_In_Practice_Both","264274087_RML_A_Generic_Language_for_Integrated_RDF_Mappings_of_Heterogeneous_Data"]}
