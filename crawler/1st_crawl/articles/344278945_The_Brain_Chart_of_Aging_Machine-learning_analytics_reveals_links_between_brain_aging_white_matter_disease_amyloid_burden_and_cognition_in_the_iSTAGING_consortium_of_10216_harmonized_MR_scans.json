{"id":"344278945_The_Brain_Chart_of_Aging_Machine-learning_analytics_reveals_links_between_brain_aging_white_matter_disease_amyloid_burden_and_cognition_in_the_iSTAGING_consortium_of_10216_harmonized_MR_scans","abstract":"Introduction: \nRelationships between brain atrophy patterns of typical aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter disease, cognition, and AD neuropathology were investigated via machine learning in a large harmonized magnetic resonance imaging database (11 studies; 10,216 subjects).\n\nMethods: \nThree brain signatures were calculated: Brain-age, AD-like neurodegeneration, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Brain Charts measured and displayed the relationships of these signatures to cognition and molecular biomarkers of AD.\n\nResults: \nWMHs were associated with advanced brain aging, AD-like atrophy, poorer cognition, and AD neuropathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. High WMH volume was associated with brain aging and cognitive decline occurring in an ≈10-year period in CN subjects. WMHs were associated with doubling the likelihood of amyloid beta (Aβ) positivity after age 65. Brain aging, AD-like atrophy, and WMHs were better predictors of cognition than chronological age in MCI/AD.\n\nDiscussion: \nA Brain Chart quantifying brain-aging trajectories was established, enabling the systematic evaluation of individuals' brain-aging patterns relative to this large consortium.","authors":["Mohamad Habes","Raymond Pomponio","Haochang Shou","Jimit
