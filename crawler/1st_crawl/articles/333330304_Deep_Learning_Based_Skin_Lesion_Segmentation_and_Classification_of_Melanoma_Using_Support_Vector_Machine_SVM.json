It can be assist medical experts on early diagnosis of melanoma\non dermoscopy images. Methods: First A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based U-net algorithm is used for\nsegmentation process. Then extract color, texture and shape features from the segmented image using Local Binary\nPattern ( LBP), Edge Histogram (EH), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Gabor method. Finally all the\nfeatures extracted from these methods were fed into the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest\nNeighbor (KNN) and Na√Øve Bayes (NB) classifiers to diagnose the skin image which is either melanoma or benign\nlesions. Results: Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The Dice co-efficiency value\nof 77.5% is achieved for image segmentation and SVM classifier produced 85.19% of accuracy. Conclusion: In deep\nlearning environment, U-Net segmentation algorithm is found to be the best method for segmentation and it helps to\nimprove the classification performance.","authors":["Seeja R D","Suresh A"],"meta":["May 2019Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention 20(5):1555-1561","DOI:10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.5.1555"],"references":["325035613_stack_Auto-encoders_Approach_For_Malignant_Melanoma_Diagnosis_in_Dermoscopy_Images","314943241_Automatic_Skin_Lesion_Analysis_using_Large-scale_Dermoscopy_Images_and_Deep_Residual_Networks","314203318_Skin_Lesion_Classification_from_Dermoscopic_Images_Using_Deep_Learning_Techniques","266915521_Automatic_Detection_of_Malignant_Melanoma_using_Macroscopic_Images","261595890_Two_Systems_for_the_Detection_of_Melanomas_in_Dermoscopy_Images_Using_Texture_and_Color_Features","228732694_A_Descriptive_Algorithm_for_Sobel_Image_Edge_Detection","224386928_Comparison_of_Segmentation_Methods_for_Melanoma_Diagnosis_in_Dermoscopy_Images","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","317723958_Hybrid_dermoscopy_image_classification_framework_based_on_deep_convolutional_neural_network_and_Fisher_vector","317216927_Vector_based_classification_of_dermoscopic_images_using_SURF","311337332_Melanoma_Classification_on_Dermoscopy_Images_Using_a_Neural_Network_Ensemble_Model","309155614_Deep_Learning_Ensembles_for_Melanoma_Recognition_in_Dermoscopy_Images","230671814_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_of_Melanoma_Using_Border-_and_Wavelet-Based_Texture_Analysis","15310886_Epiluminescence_microscopy_A_useful_tool_for_the_diagnosis_of_pigmented_skin_lesions_for_formally_trained_dermatologists","11460537_Diagnostic_accuracy_of_dermoscopy","11458019_Dermoscopy_of_pigmented_skin_lesions_-_a_valuable_tool_for_early","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
