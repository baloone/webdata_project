{"id":"349500490_Industry_40_in_the_logistics_field_A_bibliometric_analysis","abstract":"Abstract Logistics plays an essential role in supply chain management to plan and coordinate the movement of products in a timely, safely and effectively way. The recent term Logistics 4.0 focusses on the specific applications of Industry 4.0 in the area of logistics and was created as an integral part of the Industry 4.0 concept. This study aims to contribute to the state‐of‐the‐art about this topic by analysing and reviewing the scientific literature relating to Industry 4.0 applied to the logistics field. By means of a query on the Scopus database (www.scopus.com), 131 articles were retrieved and judged in line with the research topic. A bibliometric analysis identified the most relevant articles, authors, keywords, countries and journals on this subject. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of Logistics 4.0 using bibliometric analysis. Finally, the research gaps identified will provide a reference point that will encourage and guide interested researchers for future study.","authors":["Barbara Bigliardi","Giorgia Casella","Eleonora Bottani"],"meta":["February 2021IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing 3(4)","DOI:10.1049/cim2.12015"],"references":["339132818_Process_model_for_the_successful_implementation_and_demonstration_of_SME-based_industry_40_showcases_in_global_production_networks","338591704_REDTag_A_Predictive_Maintenance_Framework_for_Parcel_Delivery_Services","338382178_Logistics_Optimisation_A_Cyber_Physical_Model","338172385_Exploring_human_factors_in_Logistics_40_empirical_evidence_from_a_case_study","339289836_Logistics_centers_in_the_new_industrial_era_A_proposed_framework_for_logistics_center_40","338376928_Logistics_40_Energy_Modelling","338172304_Mastering_fourth_industrial_revolution_through_innovative_personnel_management_-_A_study_analysis_on_how_game-based_approaches_affect_competence_development","338171745_A_Survey_on_Digitalization_for_SMEs_in_Brandenburg_Germany","338161524_Extended_Value_Stream_Mapping_Method_Harmonizing_Information_Flows_for_the_Control_of_Production_Processes","338160918_Maintenance_Repair_and_Operations_Parts_Inventory_Management_in_the_Era_of_Industry_40"]}
