{"id":"346325424_Improving_the_Quality_of_The_Internet_of_Things_Instruction_in_Technology_Management_Cybersecurity_and_Computer_Science","abstract":"Many universities require end of course evaluations for all courses taught as tool for academic accreditation purposes. The reality is that often many academic departments either do not do anything or have no idea what to do when evaluations continue to be poor. As a result, students have fought back against this process to create their own on-line rating program, Rate My Professor.com, which allows students to give other students insights into who is a quality professor and who is not. This paper explores the use of mock teaching simulations, which are also called Micro-teaching approaches, as a quality management tool to improve the way students are taught in Technology Management, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science degree and certificate programs.","authors":["Darrell Norman Burrell","Sharon L Burton","Maurice Dawson","Delores Springs"],"meta":["November 2020International Journal of Information and Communication Technology"],"references":["298091381_The_Innovation_and_Promise_of_STEM-Oriented_Cybersecurity_Charter_Schools_in_Urban_Minority_Communities_in_the_United_States_as_a_Tool_to_Create_a_Critical_Business_Workforce","285663965_A_comparison_of_beginning_and_experienced_teachers'_concerns"]}
