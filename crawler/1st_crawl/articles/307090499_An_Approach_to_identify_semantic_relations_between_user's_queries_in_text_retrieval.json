{"id":"307090499_An_Approach_to_identify_semantic_relations_between_user's_queries_in_text_retrieval","abstract":"The one size fits the all approach of commercial search engines is that whatever might be the context of the query, the same results are returned to different users. The problem arises as the existing methods concentrate more on the long-term interest which reduce the effectiveness of personalized web search to provide accurate predictions of the query context. Information overload is ongoing obstacle that loses the quality of data among the huge web by providing irrelevant results. To compute the semantic similarity between the query words is challenging task due to insufficient amount of information available in ambiguous keywords submitted by the users. This paper proposes an approach to that works in 2 stages. First from the user web log file, personalized ontology is created. Second, semantic mapper is used to identify semantic relation between query context/topic that improves evaluation measures used for computing semantic relatedness between words.","authors":["Kamlesh Makvana","Patel Jay","Parth Shah","Amit Thakkar"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1145/2905055.2905271","Conference: the Second International Conference"],"references":["313170906_Word_association_norms_mutual_information_and_lexicography","282847940_Review_on_web_search_personalization_through_semantic_data","282847781_A_novel_approach_to_personalize_web_search_through_user_profiling_and_query_reformulation","266370449_Semantic_Web_Mining_-A_Critical_Review","308953917_Amazon_com_recommendations_Item-to-item_collaborative_filtering","301951311_Query_Expansion_Based_on_a_Personalized_Web_Search_Model","289698551_An_implementation_of_web_personalization_using_web_mining_techniques","267794787_Personalizing_Search_Based_on_User_Search_Histories","261262657_Knowledge_extraction_for_semantic_web_using_web_mining","261036962_Architecture_of_personalized_web_search_engine_using_suffix_tree_clustering","242038985_Hybrid_Profiling_in_Information_Retrieval","254039997_A_hybrid_approach_to_personalized_web_search","252015445_An_online_recommendation_system_based_on_web_usage_mining_and_Semantic_Web_using_LCS_Algorithm","224289425_Context-Based_Adaptive_Personalized_Web_Search_for_Improving_Information_Retrieval_Effectiveness","223304304_Select-the-Best-Ones_A_new_way_to_judge_relative_relevance"]}
