{"id":"281898416_Genomic_variant_annotation_and_prioritization_with_ANNOVAR_and_wANNOVAR","abstract":"Recent developments in sequencing techniques have enabled rapid and high-throughput generation of sequence data, democratizing the ability to compile information on large amounts of genetic variations in individual laboratories. However, there is a growing gap between the generation of raw sequencing data and the extraction of meaningful biological information. Here, we describe a protocol to use the ANNOANNOANNOANNOVARAR (ANNOANNOANNOANNOtate VARARiation) software to facilitate fast and easy variant annotations, including gene-based, region-based and filter-based annotations on a variant call format (VCF) file generated from human genomes. We further describe a protocol for gene-based annotation of a newly sequenced nonhuman species. Finally, we describe how to use a user-friendly and easily accessible web server called wANNOANNOANNOANNOVARAR to prioritize candidate genes for a Mendelian disease. The variant annotation protocols take 5–30 min of computer time, depending on the size of the variant file, and 5–10 min of hands-on time. In summary, through the command-line tool and the web server, these protocols provide a convenient means to analyze genetic variants generated in humans and other species.","authors":["Hui Yang","Kai Wang"],"meta":["September 2015Nature Protocols","DOI:10.1038/nprot.2015.105"],"references":["280157736_Phenolyzer_phenotype-based_prioritization_of_candidate_genes_for_human_diseases","274782154_AVIA_v20_Annotation_visualization_and_impact_analysis_of_genomic_variants_and_genes","270289141_Comparison_and_integration_of_deleteriousness_prediction_methods_for_nonsynonymous_SNVs_in_whole_exome_sequencing_studies","311424207_Ultrafast_and_memory-efficient_alignment_of_short_DNA_sequences_to_the_human_genome","303271679_A_program_for_annotating_and_predicting_the_effects_of_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms_SnpEff_SNPs_in_the_genome_of_Drosophila_melanogaster_strain_w1118_iso-2_iso-3","286748723_A_map_of_human_genome_variation_from_population-scale_sequencing","282354121_The_GENCODE_v7_catalog_of_human_long_noncoding_RNAs_Analysis_of_their_gene_structure_evolution_and_expression","281238574_FastQC_A_Quality_Control_tool_for_High_Throughput_Sequence_Data","275410470_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools","275410466_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools"]}
