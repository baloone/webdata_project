{"id":"339959028_Retrospective_Motion_Correction_in_Multishot_MRI_using_Generative_Adversarial_Network","abstract":"Multishot Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising data acquisition technique that can produce a high-resolution image with relatively less data acquisition time than the standard spin echo. The downside of multishot MRI is that it is very sensitive to subject motion and even small levels of motion during the scan can produce artifacts in the final magnetic resonance (MR) image, which may result in a misdiagnosis. Numerous efforts have focused on addressing this issue; however, all of these proposals are limited in terms of how much motion they can correct and require excessive computational time. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based conjugate gradient SENSE (CG-SENSE) reconstruction framework for motion correction in multishot MRI. First CG-SENSE reconstruction is employed to reconstruct an image from the motion-corrupted k-space data and then the GAN-based proposed framework is applied to correct the motion artifacts. The proposed method has been rigorously evaluated on synthetically corrupted data on varying degrees of motion, numbers of shots, and encoding trajectories. Our analyses (both quantitative as well as qualitative/visual analysis) establish that the proposed method is robust and reduces several-fold the computational time reported by the current state-of-the-art technique.","authors":["Muhammad Usman","Siddique Latif","Muhammad Asim","Byoung-Dai Lee"],"meta":["March 2020Scientific Reports 10(1):4786","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-61705-9"],"references":["332383804_Identifying_the_Best_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_Progression_Assessment_and_Overall_Survival_Prediction_in_the_BRATS_Challenge","331576745_Identifying_the_Best_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_Progression_Assessment_and_Overall_Survival_Prediction_in_the_BRATS_Challenge","325359097_Retrospective_correction_of_motion_artifact_affected_structural_MRI_images_using_deep_learning_of_simulated_motion","321987298_DAGAN_Deep_De-Aliasing_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Fast_Compressed_Sensing_MRI_Reconstruction","320966887_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","327812054_Learning_Deep_Representations_Using_Convolutional_Auto-Encoders_with_Symmetric_Skip_Connections","327709541_Phonocardiographic_Sensing_Using_Deep_Learning_for_Abnormal_Heartbeat_Detection","326561583_Deep_Generative_Adversarial_Neural_Networks_for_Compressive_Sensing_GANCS_MRI","323195718_Using_deep_autoencoders_for_facial_expression_recognition","320968363_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_a_Generative_Adversarial_Network"]}
