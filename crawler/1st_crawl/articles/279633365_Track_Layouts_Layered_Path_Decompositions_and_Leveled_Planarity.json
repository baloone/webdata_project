{"id":"279633365_Track_Layouts_Layered_Path_Decompositions_and_Leveled_Planarity","abstract":"We investigate two types of graph layouts, track layouts and layered path\ndecompositions, and the relations between their associated parameters\ntrack-number and layered pathwidth. We use these two types of layouts to\ncharacterize leveled planar graphs, the graphs with planar layered drawings\nwith no dummy vertices. It follows from the known NP-completeness of leveled\nplanarity that track-number and layered pathwidth are also NP-complete, even\nfor the smallest constant parameter values that make these parameters\nnontrivial. We prove that the graphs with bounded layered pathwidth include\nouterplanar graphs, Halin graphs, and squaregraphs, but that (despite having\nbounded track-number) series-parallel graphs do not have bounded layered\npathwidth. Finally, we investigate the parameterized complexity of these\nlayouts, showing that past methods used for book layouts don't work to\nparameterize the problem by treewidth or almost-tree number but that the\nproblem is (non-uniformly) fixed-parameter tractable for tree-depth.","authors":["Michael J.
