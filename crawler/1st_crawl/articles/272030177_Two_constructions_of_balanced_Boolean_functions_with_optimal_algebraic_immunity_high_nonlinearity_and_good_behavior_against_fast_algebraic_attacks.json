{"id":"272030177_Two_constructions_of_balanced_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_high_nonlinearity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","abstract":"In this paper, two constructions of Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity are proposed. They generalize previous ones respectively given by Rizomiliotis (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 56:4014–4024, 2010) and Zeng et al. (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 57:6310–6320, 2011) and some new functions with desired properties are obtained. The functions constructed in this paper can be balanced and have optimal algebraic degree. Further, a new lower bound on the nonlinearity of the proposed functions is established, and as a special case, it gives a new lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng functions, which is slightly better than the best previously known ones. For \\(n\\le 19\\) , the numerical results reveal that among the constructed functions in this paper, there always exist some functions with nonlinearity higher than or equal to that of the Carlet-Feng functions. These functions are also checked to have good behavior against fast algebraic attacks at least for small numbers of input variables.","authors":["Jiao Li","Claude Carlet","Xiangyong Zeng","Chunlei Li"],"meta":["March 2014Designs Codes and Cryptography 76(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-014-9949-1"],"references":["262234576_Perfect_Algebraic_Immune_Functions","235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","224138802_Constructions_of_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions_Using_Primitive_Polynomials","221355226_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","221348082_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Feedback","221347953_Efficient_Computation_of_Algebraic_Immunity_for_Algebraic_and_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","221327270_An_Infinite_Class_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_Good_Immunity_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Good_Nonlinearity","220962943_Open_Problems_Related_to_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","220942492_Improving_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","220942300_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions_Construction_and_Analysis_in_Terms_of_Algebraic_Immunity","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","220337212_On_a_weakness_of_the_Tu-Deng_function_and_its_repair","220334210_Balanced_Boolean_Functions_with_Almost_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Very_High_Nonlinearity","220334098_A_Conjecture_on_Binary_String_and_Its_Applications_on_Constructing_Boolean_Functions_of_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","220333385_A_Method_of_Construction_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimum_Algebraic_Immunity","3085927_Algebraic_immunity_for_cryptographically_significant_Boolean_functions_Analysis_and_construction","246436452_Improving_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_Fast_Software_Encryption_2004","226676049_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","225527740_Construction_and_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions_of_2t1_Variables_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","224242527_Comments_on_Constructions_of_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions_Using_Primitive_Polynomials","224155509_On_the_Resistance_of_Boolean_Functions_Against_Algebraic_Attacks_Using_Univariate_Polynomial_Representation","221540831_On_the_Algebraic_Immunity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","221354680_Rewriting_Variables_The_Complexity_of_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","220848484_A_Note_on_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Higher_Order_Nonlinearities","220682886_More_Balanced_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Nonlinearity_and_Resistance_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","220639415_On_the_security_of_the_Feng-Liao-Yang_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","220639279_A_conjecture_on_binary_string_and_its_applicationson_constructing_Boolean_functions_of_optimal_algebraic_immunity","46946127_The_Stability_Theory_of_Stream_Ciphers","3086738_On_the_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","3086335_A_New_Attack_on_the_Filter_Generator"]}
