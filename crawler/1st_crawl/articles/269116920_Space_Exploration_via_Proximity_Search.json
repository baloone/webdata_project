{"id":"269116920_Space_Exploration_via_Proximity_Search","abstract":"We investigate what computational tasks can be performed on a point set in\n$\\Re^d$, if we are only given black-box access to it via nearest-neighbor\nsearch. This is a reasonable assumption if the underlying point set is either\nprovided implicitly, or it is stored in a data structure that can answer such\nqueries. In particular, we show the following: (A) One can compute an\napproximate bi-criteria $k$-center clustering of the point set, and more\ngenerally compute a greedy permutation of the point set. (B) One can decide if\na query point is (approximately) inside the convex-hull of the point set.\nWe also investigate the problem of clustering the given point set, such that\nmeaningful proximity queries can be carried out on the centers of the clusters,\ninstead of the whole point set.","authors":["Sariel Har-Peled","Nirman Kumar","David Mount","Benjamin Raichel"],"meta":["September 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9801-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256195163_The_Atomic_Force_Microscope","324427800_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","319770399_Approximate_nearest_neighbors_towards_removing_the_curse_of_dimensionality","292215841_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_and_Dense_Bipartite_Subgraphs_via_an_Approximate_Version_of_Caratheodory's_Theorem","288152216_Atomic_Force_Microscopy","267147479_Geometric_Approximation_Algorithms","265386006_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry_A_Survey","262325098_Geometric_reconstruction_problems","253239984_An_efficient_proximity_probing_algorithm_for_metrology"]}
