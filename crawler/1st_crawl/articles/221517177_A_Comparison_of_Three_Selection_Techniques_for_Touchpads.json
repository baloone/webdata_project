{"id":"221517177_A_Comparison_of_Three_Selection_Techniques_for_Touchpads","abstract":"Three methods of implementing the select operation on touchpads were compared. Two conventional methods -using a physical button and using \"lift-and-tap\" -were compared with a new method using finger pressure with tactile feedback. The latter employs a pressure-sensing touchpad with a built-in relay. The relay is energized by a signal Corn the device driver when the finger pressure on the pad surface exceeds a programmable threshold, and this creates both aural and tactile feedback. The pressure data are also used to signal the action of a button press to the application. In an empirical test with 12 participants, the tactile condition was 20% faster than l&and-tap and 46% faster than using a button for selection. The result was similar on the ISO-recomm ended measure known as throughput. Error rates were higher with the tactile condition, however. These we attriiute to limitations in the prototype, such as the use of a capacitive-sensing touchpad and poor mechanical design. In a questionnaire, participants indicated a preference for the tactile condition over the button and lift-and-tap conditions.","authors":["I.
