{"id":"238720638_A_4k2_kernel_for_feedback_vertex_set","abstract":"We prove that given an undirected graph G on n vertices and an integer k, one can compute, in polynomial time in n, a graph G′ with at most 4k2 vertices and an integer k′ such that G has a feedback vertex set of size at most k iff G′ has a feedback vertex set of size at most k′. This result improves a previous O(k11) kernel of Burrage et al., and a more recent cubic kernel of Bodlaender. This problem was communicated by Fellows.","authors":["Stéphan Thomassé"],"meta":["March 2010ACM Transactions on Algorithms 6(2):1-8","DOI:10.1145/1721837.1721848"],"references":["225136508_An_O2Okn3_FPT_algorithm_for_the_undirected_Feedback_Vertex_Set_problem","221499631_An_Osqrtv_E_Algorithm_for_Finding_Maximum_Matching_in_General_Graphs","221219864_Improved_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_Two_Feedback_Set_Problems","221025767_Fixed_Parameter_Tractability_and_Completeness","220992899_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Feedback_Vertex_Set","220430744_A_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithm_for_the_Directed_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem","29462499_The_Undirected_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem_Has_a_Polyk_Kernel","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","261861261_A_short_proof_of_Mader's_I_-paths_theorem_319","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","244750029_Finding_a_Minimum_Feedback_Vertex_Set_in_time_O17548n","242963388_Maximum-Minimum_Satze_und_verallgemeinerte_Faktoren_von_Graphen","238888030_Disjoint_A-paths_in_digraphs","225544116_On_disjoint_cycles","222669279_Asymptotically_optimal_Kk-packings_of_dense_graphs_via_fractional_Kk-decompositions","221543900_Faster_Fixed_Parameter_Tractable_Algorithms_for_Undirected_Feedback_Vertex_Set","221209544_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220995067_A_Cubic_Kernel_for_Feedback_Vertex_Set","220992962_A_Linear_Kernel_for_Planar_Feedback_Vertex_Set","220180238_On_Disjoint_Cycles","220081466_Faster_algorithms_for_feedback_vertex_set","220075999_A_Short_Proof_of_Mader's_sigma-Paths_Theorem","46677162_Open_Problems_in_Parameterized_and_Exact_Computation_---_IWPEC_2006","45338747_A_short_proof_of_Mader's_S-paths_theorem"]}
