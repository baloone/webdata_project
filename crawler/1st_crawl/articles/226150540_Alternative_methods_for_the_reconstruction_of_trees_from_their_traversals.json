{"id":"226150540_Alternative_methods_for_the_reconstruction_of_trees_from_their_traversals","abstract":"It is well-known that given the inorder traversal of a binary tree's nodes, along with either one of its preorder or postorder traversals, the original binary tree can be reconstructed using a recursive algorithm. In this short note we provide a short, elegent, iterative solution to this classical problem.","authors":["H. A. Burgdorff","Sushil Jajodia","F. N. Springsteel","Y. Zalcstein"],"meta":["June 1987BIT.
