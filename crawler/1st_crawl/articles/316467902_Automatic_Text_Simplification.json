{"id":"316467902_Automatic_Text_Simplification","abstract":"Thanks to the availability of texts on the Web in recent years, increased knowledge and information have been made available to broader audiences. However, the way in which a text is written—its vocabulary, its syntax—can be difficult to read and understand for many people, especially those with poor literacy, cognitive or linguistic impairment, or those with limited knowledge of the language of the text. Texts containing uncommon words or long and complicated sentences can be difficult to read and understand by people as well as difficult to analyze by machines. Automatic text simplification is the process of transforming a text into another text which, ideally conveying the same message, will be easier to read and understand by a broader audience. The process usually involves the replacement of difficult or unknown phrases with simpler equivalents and the transformation of long and syntactically complex sentences into shorter and less complex ones. Automatic text simplification, a research topi...","authors":["Horacio Saggion"],"meta":["April 2017Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies 10(1):1-137","DOI:10.2200/S00700ED1V01Y201602HLT032"],"references":["311317104_The_Influence_of_Pre-processing_on_the_Estimation_of_Readability_of_Web_Documents","301404409_Reliable_Lexical_Simplification_for_Non-Native_Speakers","295706920_One_Half_or_50_An_Eye-Tracking_Study_of_Number_Representation_Readability","280247184_A_Deeper_Exploration_of_the_Standard_PB-SMT_Approach_to_Text_Simplification_and_its_Evaluation","273067823_Improved_Semantic_Representations_From_Tree-Structured_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","271640179_Reconstructing_Readability_Recent_Developments_and_Recommendations_in_the_Analysis_of_Text_Difficulty","271521993_Frequent_Words_Improve_Readability_and_Short_Words_Improve_Understandability_for_People_with_Dyslexia","271451836_Revisiting_readability","270904580_Associative_Lexical_Cohesion_as_a_factor_in_Text_Complexity","268238583_Fluency_adequacy_or_HTER","264875990_Towards_a_French_lexicon_with_difficulty_measures_NLP_helping_to_bridge_the_gap_between_traditional_dictionaries_and_specialized_lexicons","262250828_ERNESTA_A_Sentence_Simplification_Tool_for_Children's_Stories_in_Italian","261797212_Readability_Assessment_for_Text_Simplification_From_Analyzing_Documents_to_Identifying_Sentential_Simplifications","261210178_iSimp_A_sentence_simplification_system_for_biomedical_text","257547187_The_English_Lexical_substitution_task","238769089_Findings_of_the_2009_Workshop_on_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Chris_Callison-Burch","234789404_One_sense_per_discourse","231361144_Question_Generation_for_French_Collating_Parsers_and_Paraphrasing_Questions","230876751_Efficient_Parsing_of_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Dependency_Structures","229060015_Rethorical_Structure_Theory_Toward_a_functional_theory_of_text_organization","226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","225119845_Translating_from_Complex_to_Simplified_Sentences","224950738_Erratum_to_Age-of-acquisition_ratings_for_30000_English_words","329977722_Problems_in_Current_Text_Simplification_Research_New_Data_Can_Help","321614309_Computational_Linguistics_and_Intelligent_Text_Processing_8th_International_Conference_CICLing_2007_Mexico_City_Mexico_February_18-24_2007_Proceedings","314793670_A_statistical_model_for_scientific_readability","304020796_YATS_Yet_Another_Text_Simplifier","291088432_Learning_to_Simplify_Children_Stories_with_Limited_Data","285704049_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Models","284131524_Translating_Text_into_Pictographs","278670441_Moses","276322061_Assessing_document_and_sentence_readability_in_less_resourced_languages_and_across_textual_genres","276322060_Computational_assessment_of_text_readability_A_survey_of_current_and_future_research","276321866_Making_numerical_information_more_accessible_The_implementation_of_a_Numerical_Expression_Simplification_System_for_Spanish","276256650_Making_It_Simplext_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_a_Text_Simplification_System_for_Spanish","272297956_Simplifying_Words_in_Context_Experiments_with_two_LexicalResources_in_Spanish","271452209_Models_for_sentence_compression","270878761_Simple_readable_sub-sentences","263588769_A_Spanish_Readability_Formula","262406619_Automatic_Text_Simplification_in_Spanish_A_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Complementing_Modules","262322067_Simplify_or_help_Text_simplification_strategies_for_people_with_dyslexia","262184200_Treebanks_Building_and_Using_Parsed_Corpora","258407368_Text_Speech_and_Dialogue","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","255652618_Simplifying_Text_in_Medical_Literature","243969510_Easy-to-read_Texts_for_Students_with_Intellectual_Disability_Linguistic_Factors_Affecting_Comprehension","243698081_Performance_Evaluation_of_Supertagging_for_Partial_Parsing","243480073_Tree_adjoining_grammar_and_the_reluctant_paraphrasing_of_text","235974936_Empirical_Identification_of_Text_Simplification_Strategies_for_Reading-Impaired_People","234812513_Automatic_evaluation_of_machine_translation_quality_using_n-gram_co-occurrence_statistics","221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","221614756_Personalizing_Web_search_results_by_reading_level","224890498_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Summaries_Using_n-gram_Co-occurrence_Statistics","222551887_Summarization_beyond_sentence_extraction_A_probabilistic_approach_to_sentence_compression","221652040_Helping_aphasic_people_process_online_information"]}
