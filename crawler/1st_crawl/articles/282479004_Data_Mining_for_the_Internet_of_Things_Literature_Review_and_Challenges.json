{"id":"282479004_Data_Mining_for_the_Internet_of_Things_Literature_Review_and_Challenges","abstract":"The massive data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) are considered of high business value, and data mining algorithms \ncan be applied to IoT to extract hidden information from data. In this paper, we give a systematic way to review data mining \nin knowledge view, technique view, and application view, including classification, clustering, association analysis, \ntime series analysis and outlier analysis. And the latest application cases are also surveyed. \nAs more and more devices connected to IoT, large volume of data should be analyzed, \nthe latest algorithms should be modified to apply to big data. We reviewed these algorithms and discussed challenges \nand open research issues. At last a suggested big data mining system is proposed.","authors":["Feng Chen","Pan Deng","Jiafu Wan","Daqiang Zhang"],"meta":["August 2015International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks 2015(9):1-14","DOI:10.1155/2015/431047"],"references":["307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","316799393_Big_Data","316694710_High_Performance_Discovery_in_Time_Series","313604619_A_two-step_method_to_construct_credit_scoring_models_with_data_mining_techniques","313059954_Twin_support_vector_machines_for_pattern_classification_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence","312449349_K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm","308263678_Dimensionality_reduction_for_fast_similarity_search_in_large_time_series_databases","307175251_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","296951769_Social_recommender_systems","296174084_Study_on_a_GA-based_SVM_decision-tree_multi-classification_strategy"]}
