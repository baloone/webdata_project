{"id":"304896323_On_a_Silicon-Based_Photonic-Crystal_Cavity_for_the_Near-IR_Region_Numerical_Simulation_and_Formation_Technology","abstract":"The production technology of a photonic-crystal cavity formed as a group of holes in a silicon strip waveguide by ion-beam etching is described. The parasitic effect associated with hole conicity which develops upon hole formation by the given technology is studied. Numerical simulation shows that the hole-conicity induced decrease in the cavity quality factor can be compensated with consideration for the hole volume. The influence of the waveguide thickness on the resonance wavelength and quality factor of the photonic-crystal cavity is analyzed.","authors":["Margarita V. Stepikhova","P.G. Serafimovich","N. L.
