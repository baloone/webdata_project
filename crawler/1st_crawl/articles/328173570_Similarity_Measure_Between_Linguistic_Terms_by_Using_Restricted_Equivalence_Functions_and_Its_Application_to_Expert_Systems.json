{"id":"328173570_Similarity_Measure_Between_Linguistic_Terms_by_Using_Restricted_Equivalence_Functions_and_Its_Application_to_Expert_Systems","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose a new similarity measure between linguistic terms by using restricted equivalence functions. We formally define it and prove that it fulfills similarity conditions. We explain how this measure can be employed for improving approximate reasoning in expert system inference engines and for maximizing similarity measures between linguistic terms. Finally, an experimental comparison between similarity measures is performed.","authors":["Clemente Rubio Manzano"],"meta":["January 2019Studies in Computational Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-00485-9_11","In book: Trends in Mathematics and Computational Intelligence (pp.97-102)","Project: Fuzzy Linguistic Prolog and Fuzzy Logic Programming"],"references":["262358878_A_Fuzzy_linguistic_prolog_and_its_applications","221359191_An_efficient_fuzzy_unification_method_and_its_implementation_into_the_BousiProlog_system","223851437_Weighted_fuzzy_pattern_matching","222025134_Relationship_between_restricted_dissimilarity_functions_restricted_equivalence_functions_and_normal_EN-functions_Image_thresholding_invariant","220646319_New_similarity_measures_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_application_to_pattern_recognitions","220528572_Image_thresholding_using_restricted_equivalence_functions_and_maximizing_the_measures_of_similarity","220527553_Restricted_equivalence_functions"]}
