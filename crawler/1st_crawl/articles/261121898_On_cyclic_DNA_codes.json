{"id":"261121898_On_cyclic_DNA_codes","abstract":"This paper considers cyclic DNA codes of arbitrary length over the ring R = F2[u]/(u4 - 1). A mapping is given between the elements of R and the alphabet {A, C, G, T} which allows the additive stem distance to be extended to this ring. Then, cyclic codes over R are designed such that their images under the mapping are also cyclic or quasi-cyclic of index 2 with designed hybridization energy. The hybridization energy and additive distance are shown to be functions of the neighborhood energy.","authors":["Kenza Guenda","T.
