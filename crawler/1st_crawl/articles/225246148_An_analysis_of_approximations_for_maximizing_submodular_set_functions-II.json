{"id":"225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","abstract":"Let N be a finite set and \na nonempty collection of subsets of N which have the property that \nand F\n2⊂F\n1 imply \n. A real-valued function z defined on the subsets of N that satifies z(S)≤z(T) for all S⊂T⊃-N and z(S)+z(T)≥(S∪T)+z(S∩T) for all S,T⊂-N is called nondecreasing and submodular. We consider the problem \n, z(S) submodular and nondecreasing} and several special cases of it.\n\nWe analyze greedy and local improvement heuristics, and a linera programming relaxation when z(S) is linear. Our results are worst case bounds on the quality of the approximations. For example, when (N, \n) is described by the intersection of P matroids, we show that a greedy heuristic always produces a solution whose value is at least 1/(P+1) times the optimal value. This bound can be achieved for all positive integers P.","authors":["M. L. Fisher","George L.
