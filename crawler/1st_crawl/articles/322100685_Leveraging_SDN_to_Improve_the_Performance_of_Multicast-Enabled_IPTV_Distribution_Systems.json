{"id":"322100685_Leveraging_SDN_to_Improve_the_Performance_of_Multicast-Enabled_IPTV_Distribution_Systems","abstract":"Distribution of live multimedia streams to a high number of end users through an ISP network may be efficiently implemented through IP mul-ticasting. Multicast traffic engineering with traditional decentralized approaches, however, is still a challenging problem for network operators. In this article we present a centralized approach to management of source-specific multicast traffic flows relying on software defined networking. Our approach is suitable for hybrid IP/SDN networks , where network nodes behave as traditional IP routers by default, but whose packet forwarding behavior may be customized for specific flows thanks to an OpenFlow-enabled control plane. We also describe a traffic management system that we implemented as a proof of concept, which can be used by an ISP to compute multi-cast distribution trees for a given set of channels to be distributed to their customers.","authors":["Simon Pietro Romano","Roberto Canonico"],"meta":["December 2017IEEE Communications Standards Magazine 1(4)","DOI:10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700036"],"references":["299861267_The_Virtual_Puppet_Master_Adaptive_Streaming_on_Top_of_an_SDN-Enabled_Virtual_Infrastructure","283228591_Experience_of_developing_an_openflow_SDN_prototype_for_managing_IPTV_networks","261959448_Opportunities_and_Research_Challenges_of_Hybrid_Software_Defined_Networks","312543702_Software_Defined_Networking_Architecture_Standardization","309170906_Emerging_transport_SDN_architecture_and_use_cases","305705930_Multicast_traffic_engineering_for_software-defined_networks","286680520_Traffic_engineering_in_SDNOSPF_hybrid_network","280696155_Multi-Tree_Multicast_Traffic_Engineering_for_Software-Defined_Networks","261060209_Traffic_engineering_in_software_defined_networks","234790963_An_Overview_of_Source-Specific_Multicast_SSM"]}
