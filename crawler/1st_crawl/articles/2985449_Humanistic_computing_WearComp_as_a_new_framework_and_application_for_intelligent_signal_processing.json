{"id":"2985449_Humanistic_computing_WearComp_as_a_new_framework_and_application_for_intelligent_signal_processing","abstract":"Humanistic computing is proposed as a new signal processing\nframework in which the processing apparatus is inextricably intertwined\nwith the natural capabilities of our human body and mind. The emphasis\nof this paper is on personal imaging applications of humanistic\ncomputing, to take a first step toward an intelligent wearable camera\nsystem that can allow one to effortlessly capture our day-to-day\nexperiences, help us remember and see better, provide us with personal\nsafety through crime reduction, and facilitate new forms of\ncommunication through collective connected humanistic computing. The\nauthor's wearable signal processing hardware currently provides the\ncomputational power of a UNIX workstation concealed within\nordinary-looking eyeglasses and clothing. Thus it may be worn\ncontinuously during all facets of ordinary day-to-day living, so that,\nthrough long-term adaptation, it begins to function as a true extension\nof the mind and body","authors":["Steve Mann"],"meta":["December 1998Proceedings of the IEEE 86(11):2123 - 2151","DOI:10.1109/5.726784","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["265003047_Humanistic_Intelligence","243764888_Motion_and_Structure_from_Motion_in_a_Piecewise_Planar_Environment","227132073_Performance_Of_Optical_Flow_Techniques","222450615_Determining_Optical_Flow","222444142_Improving_resolution_by_image_registration","221573423_Salient_Video_Stills_Content_and_Context_Preserved","221571937_Smart_clothing_Wearable_Multimedia_Computing_and_Personal_Imaging_to_Restore_the_Technological_Balance_Between_People_and_Their_Environments","220501370_A_computational_vision_approach_to_image_registration","220420450_Knowledge-Based_Augmented_Reality","30871774_Image_and_Brain_The_Resolution_of_the_Imagery_Debate","5556443_A_computation_vision_approach_to_image_registration","327305203_Low_power_microelectronics_Retrospect_and_prospect","313616418_Determining_optical_ow","312230773_A_method_for_the_solution_of_certain_nonlinear_problems_in_least_squares","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","285037396_Frequency-Domain_Fourier-Mellin_Descriptors_For_Invariant_Pattern_Recognition","284319069_Knowledge-based_augmented_reality_Communications_of_the_ACM","280299685_Wavelets_and_Chirplets_Time-Frequency_Perspectives_With_Applications","273140184_Method_and_apparatus_for_relating_and_combining_multiple_images_of_the_same_scene_or_object_s","262286685_Wavelets_and_Chirplets_time-frequency_perspectives_with_applications","260812488_Fuzzy_Logic","248192185_Ubiquitous_Computing_Definition_1","246243419_Frequency-domain_Fourier-Mellin_descriptors_for_invariant_pattern_recognition","245802778_Correcting_for_radial_lens_distortion_A_simple_implementation","243765052_Fuzzy_Thinking_the_New_Science_of_Fuzzy_Logic","243616389_Determining_3-d_motion_and_structure_from_optical_flow_generated_by_several_moving_objects","242524650_Compositing_multiple_pictures_of_the_same_scene_generalized_large_displacement_8-parameter_motion","242359778_Steps_toward_artificial_intelligence","239665704_Direct_estimation_of_displacement_histograms","239385181_An_Algorithm_for_the_Estimation_of_Nonlinear_Parameters","238690762_A_conceptual_framework_for_the_augmentation_of_man's_intellect","237128207_Synaesthesia_A_union_of_the_senses","236550097_Readings_in_Human-Computer_Interaction_A_Multidisciplinary_Approach","232598868_The_Formation_and_Transformation_of_the_Perceptual_World","228057968_Augmenting_Human_Intellect_A_Conceptual_Framework","226547554_Smart_ctothing_The_wearable_computer_and_WearCam","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","224927663_Affective_Computing","224377887_Determining_Three-Dimensional_Motion_and_Structure_from_Optical_Flow_Generated_by_Several_Moving_Objects","223083094_The_Lie_algebra_of_visual_perception","221678287_An_Algorithm_for_Least_Square_Estimation_of_Non-Linear_Parameters","220660429_A_novel_algorithm_for_color_constancy","220660147_Self-Calibration_of_Stationary_Cameras","220141646_Affective_Wearables","220089623_Architectural_Anatomy","216212779_A_Method_for_The_Solution_of_Certain_Non-Linear_Problem_in_Least_Squares","202165695_Turn_Signals_are_the_Facial_Expressions_of_Automobiles","30833725_Determining_optical_flow_A_retrospective","22226116_The_Retinex_Theory_of_Color_Vision","11804064_A_Sensate_Liner_for_personnel_monitoring_applications","3693287_Further_developments_on_HeadCam'_joint_estimation_of_camera_rotationgain_group_of_transformations_for_wearable_bi-foveated_cameras","3717874_An_historical_account_of_the_'WearComp'_and_'WearCam'_inventions_developed_for_applications_in_'personal_imaging'","3717838_A_Sensate_liner_for_personal_monitoring_applications","3683965_Simplifying_motion_and_structure_analysis_using_planar_parallax_and_image_warping","3683909_Direct_recovery_of_shape_from_multiple_views_A_parallax_based_approach"]}
