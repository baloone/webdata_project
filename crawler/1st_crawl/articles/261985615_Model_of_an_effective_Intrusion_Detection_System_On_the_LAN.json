{"id":"261985615_Model_of_an_effective_Intrusion_Detection_System_On_the_LAN","abstract":"Despite the development of new technologies of information\nand communication following the advent of the Internet and\nnetworks, computer security has become a major challenge,\nand works in this research are becoming more numerous.\nVarious tools and mechanisms are developed to ensure a level\nof security to meet the demands of modern life. Among the\nsystems, intrusion detection for identifying abnormal behavior\nor suspicious activities to undermine the legitimate operation\nof the system. The objective of this paper is the design and\nimplementation of a comprehensive architecture of IDS in a network.","authors":["Yousef Farhaoui"],"meta":["March 2012","Project: The design of an online learning system in Morocco (especially rural areas)"],"references":["261985360_Performance_Assessment_of_Tools_of_the_Intrusion_DetectionPrevention_Systems","232346896_NADIR_An_automated_system_for_detecting_network_intrusion_and_misuse"]}
