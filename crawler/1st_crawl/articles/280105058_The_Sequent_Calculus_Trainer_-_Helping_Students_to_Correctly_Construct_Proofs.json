{"id":"280105058_The_Sequent_Calculus_Trainer_-_Helping_Students_to_Correctly_Construct_Proofs","abstract":"We present the Sequent Calculus Trainer, a tool that supports students in\nlearning how to correctly construct proofs in the sequent calculus for\nfirst-order logic with equality. It is a proof assistant fostering the\nunderstanding of all the syntactic principles that need to be obeyed in\nconstructing correct proofs. It does not provide any help in finding good proof\nstrategies. Instead it aims at understanding the sequent calculus on a lower\nsyntactic level that needs to be mastered before one can consider proof\nstrategies. Its main feature is a proper feedback system embedded in a\ngraphical user interface. We also report on some empirical findings that\nindicate how the Sequent Calculus Trainer can improve the students' success in\nlearning sequent calculus for full first-order logic.","authors":["Arno Ehle","Norbert Hundeshagen","Martin Lange"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["238676683_Teaching_Theoretical_Computer_Science_at_the_Undergraduate_Level_Experiences_Observations_and_Proposals_to_Improve_the_Status_Quo","227450483_Inverting_the_Classroom_A_Gateway_to_Creating_an_Inclusive_Learning_Environment","220987572_Panda_A_Proof_Assistant_in_Natural_Deduction_for_All_A_Gentzen_Style_Proof_Assistant_for_Undergraduate_Students","220458453_Animating_Formal_Proof_at_the_Surface_The_Jape_Proof_Calculator","220091249_SyntacticSemantic_Interactions_in_Programmer_Behavior_A_Model_and_Experimental_Results","215835935_Cognitive_Tutors_Lessons_Learned","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","262271135_Rolling_the_dice_on_theory_one_department's_decision_to_strengthen_the_theoretical_computing_aspect_of_their_curriculum","36239572_Untersuchungen_uber_das_logische_Schliessen"]}
