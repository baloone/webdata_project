{"id":"344413339_Quantum_device_fine-tuning_using_unsupervised_embedding_learning","abstract":"Quantum devices with a large number of gate electrodes allow for precise control of device parameters. This capability is hard to fully exploit due to the complex dependence of these parameters on applied gate voltages. We experimentally demonstrate an algorithm capable of fine-tuning several device parameters at once. The algorithm acquires a measurement and assigns it a score using a variational auto-encoder. Gate voltage settings are set to optimize this score in real-time in an unsupervised fashion. We report fine-tuning times of a double quantum dot device within approximately 40 min.","authors":["Nina van Esbroeck","Dominic Lennon","Hyungil Moon","Vu Nguyen"],"meta":["September 2020New Journal of Physics 22(Focus on Machine Learning Across Physics)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/abb64c","Project: Efficiently tuning quantum devices using machine learning"],"references":["343740650_Machine_learning_enables_completely_automatic_tuning_of_a_quantum_device_faster_than_human_experts","337116767_Efficiently_measuring_a_quantum_device_using_machine_learning","334314829_Rapid_gate-based_spin_read-out_in_silicon_using_an_on-chip_resonator","333061552_Gate-based_high_fidelity_spin_readout_in_a_CMOS_device","332583404_Loading_a_quantum-dot_based_Qubyte_register","331660544_Gate-based_single-shot_readout_of_spins_in_silicon","331528944_Shuttling_a_single_charge_across_a_one-dimensional_array_of_silicon_quantum_dots","329203828_Single-Shot_Single-Gate_rf_Spin_Readout_in_Silicon","332163896_A_machine_learning_approach_for_automated_fine-tuning_of_semiconductor_spin_qubits","327047306_Single_double_and_triple_quantum_dots_in_GeSi_nanowires"]}
