{"id":"318660028_A_New_Cognitive_Hierarchy_Model_for_Applied_Computer_Science","abstract":"This paper outlines a new cognitive hierarchy that is designed specifically for learning in computer science. The primary motivator for the new hierarchy is that the existing cognitive hierarchies are still largely based on Bloomâ€™s taxonomy, which fits poorly to the field of applied computer science and remains problematic despite a number of revisions and adaptations. The new design is based on an empirical evaluation of learning in applied computer science and consideration of the computer security model.\n\nhttps://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=63106","authors":["Klaas Stoker"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":[]}
