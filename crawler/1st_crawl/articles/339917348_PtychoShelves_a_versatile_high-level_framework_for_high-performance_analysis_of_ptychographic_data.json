{"id":"339917348_PtychoShelves_a_versatile_high-level_framework_for_high-performance_analysis_of_ptychographic_data","abstract":"Over the past decade, ptychography has been proven to be a robust tool for non-destructive high-resolution quantitative electron, X-ray and optical microscopy. It allows for quantitative reconstruction of the specimen's transmissivity, as well as recovery of the illuminating wavefront. Additionally, various algorithms have been developed to account for systematic errors and improved convergence. With fast ptychographic microscopes and more advanced algorithms, both the complexity of the reconstruction task and the data volume increase significantly. PtychoShelves is a software package which combines high-level modularity for easy and fast changes to the data-processing pipeline, and high-performance computing on CPUs and GPUs.","authors":["Klaus Wakonig","Hans-Christian Stadler","Michal Kronenberg","Esther Hsiao Rho Tsai"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Applied Crystallography 53(2)","DOI:10.1107/S1600576720001776"],"references":["337704331_Alignment_methods_for_nanotomography_with_deep_subpixel_accuracy","330829829_X-ray_Fourier_ptychography","330639883_Fast_positioning_for_X-ray_scanning_microscopy_by_a_combined_motion_of_sample_and_beam-defining_optics","322783854_Iterative_least-squares_solver_for_generalized_maximum-likelihood_ptychography","320288729_A_three-dimensional_view_of_structural_changes_caused_by_deactivation_of_fluid_catalytic_cracking_catalysts","327705486_Resonant_Ptychographic_Tomography_Facilitates_Three-Dimensional_Quantitative_Colocalization_of_Catalyst_Components_and_Chemical_Elements","326943751_Performance_and_Ongoing_Development_of_the_Velociprobe_a_Fast_Hard_X-ray_Nanoprobe_for_High-Resolution_Ptychographic_Imaging","322009344_X-ray_ptychography","318562312_Three-dimensional_magnetization_structures_revealed_with_X-ray_vector_nanotomography","318043221_Further_improvements_to_the_ptychographical_iterative_engine"]}
