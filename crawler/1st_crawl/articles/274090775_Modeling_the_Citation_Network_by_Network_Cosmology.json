{"id":"274090775_Modeling_the_Citation_Network_by_Network_Cosmology","abstract":"Citation between papers can be treated as a causal relationship. In addition, some citation networks have a number of similarities to the causal networks in network cosmology, e.g., the similar in-and out-degree distributions. Hence, it is possible to model the citation network using network cosmology. The casual network models built on homogenous spacetimes have some restrictions when describing some phenomena in citation networks, e.g., the hot papers receive more citations than other simultaneously published papers. We propose an inhomogenous causal network model to model the citation network, the connection mechanism of which well expresses some features of citation. The node growth trend and degree distributions of the generated networks also fit those of some citation networks well.","authors":["Zheng Xie","Ouyang Zhenzheng","Pengyuan Zhang","Dongyun Yi"],"meta":["March 2015PLoS ONE 10(3):e0120687","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0120687","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260352810_Finding_Scientific_Gems_with_Google","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","298808365_The_Simultaneous_Evolution_of_Author_and_Paper_Networks","278658061_Citation_Networks","269992536_Networks_of_Scientific_Papers","262389568_Replaying_the_geometric_growth_of_complex_networks_and_application_to_the_AS_internet","257217843_Measuring_the_preferential_attachment_mechanism_in_citation_networks","254332090_On_a_generalization_of_the_POISSON_distribution","250428492_Laws_of_Graph_Evolution_Densiflcation_and_Shrinking_Diameters","238124458_Evolution_of_Networks_From_Biological_Nets_to_the_Internet_and_WWW"]}
