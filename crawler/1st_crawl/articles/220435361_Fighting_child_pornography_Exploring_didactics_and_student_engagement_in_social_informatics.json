{"id":"220435361_Fighting_child_pornography_Exploring_didactics_and_student_engagement_in_social_informatics","abstract":"[This is only an excerpt, not the full paper]-----------\nThis article describes a unique educational project that was implemented in the undergraduate study of computer science in 2002. Nesna University College has been using the example of sexual abuse of children in case study teaching in social informatics, in order to create an environment for intrinsically motivated learning. The project also gave the students a unique opportunity to get involved both emotionally and practically in the field of social informatics. The project is run in cooperation with Save the Children Norway and the Norwegian National Crime Squad. Nesna University College has the only computer science program in the world that has sexual abuse of children as the main topic on the curriculum. The computer science students provide both the Save the Children Norway and the National Criminal Investigation Service with reports on various topics such as secure chat, camera phones and possible abuse, Freenet as a tool for sexual abuse, etc. This exceptional cooperation between higher education and public and private organizations in this field makes the project not only unique, but might also be a major factor in both the willingness of students to learn social informatics and their development of skills in the various topics of social informatics.","authors":["Per Arne Godejord"],"meta":["February 2007Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58(3):446-451","DOI:10.1002/asi.20522","SourceDBLP"],"references":["233896880_Quality_of_Learning_With_an_Active_Versus_Passive_Motivational_Set","11946306_Self-Determination_Theory_and_the_Facilitation_of_Intrinsic_Motivation_Social_Development_and_Well-Being","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","233896840_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior"]}
