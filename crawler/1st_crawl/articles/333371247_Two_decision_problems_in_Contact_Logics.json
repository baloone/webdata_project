{"id":"333371247_Two_decision_problems_in_Contact_Logics","abstract":"Contact Logics provide a natural framework for representing and reasoning about regions in several areas of computer science. In this paper, we focus our attention on reasoning methods for Contact Logics and address the satisfiability problem and the unifiability problem. Firstly, we give sound and complete tableaux-based decision procedures in Contact Logics and we obtain new results about the decidability/complexity of the satisfiability problem in these logics. Secondly, we address the computability of the unifiability problem in Contact Logics and we obtain new results about the unification type of the unifiability problem in these logics.","authors":["Zafer Özdemir","Çiğdem Gencer","Philippe Balbiani"],"meta":["February 2019Logic Journal of IGPL 27(1):8-32","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzy016"],"references":["330422421_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422329_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","330422013_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_A_Proximity_Approach-I","264849783_Extending_Unification_in_EL_towards_General_TBoxes","251218417_Topological_logics_over_Euclidean_spaces","344486660_Modal_Logic","312835867_Admissibility_and_Unifiability_in_Contact_Logics","268546805_Sahlqvist_theorems_for_precontact_logics","261958593_Definability_and_Canonicity_for_Boolean_Logic_with_a_Binary_Relation","245215801_Admissibility_of_Logical_Inference_Rules","226341313_Region-Based_Theory_of_Space_Algebras_of_Regions_Representation_Theory_and_Logics","243773782_Spatial_representation_and_reasoning_in_RCC8_with_Boolean_region_terms","229710549_On_languages_with_two_variables","227125282_Axiomatic_classes_in_propositional_modal_logic","222709128_Unification_of_Concept_Terms_in_Description_Logics"]}
