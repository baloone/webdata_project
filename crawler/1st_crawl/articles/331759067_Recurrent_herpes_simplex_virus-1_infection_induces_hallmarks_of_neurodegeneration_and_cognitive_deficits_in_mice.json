{"id":"331759067_Recurrent_herpes_simplex_virus-1_infection_induces_hallmarks_of_neurodegeneration_and_cognitive_deficits_in_mice","abstract":"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a DNA neurotropic virus, usually establishing latent infections in the trigeminal ganglia followed by periodic reactivations. Although numerous findings suggested potential links between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a causal relation has not been demonstrated yet. Hence, we set up a model of recurrent HSV-1 infection in mice undergoing repeated cycles of viral reactivation. By virological and molecular analyses we found: i) HSV-1 spreading and replication in different brain regions after thermal stress-induced virus reactivations; ii) accumulation of AD hallmarks including amyloid-β protein, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation markers (astrogliosis, IL-1β and IL-6). Remarkably, the progressive accumulation of AD molecular biomarkers in neocortex and hippocampus of HSV-1 infected mice, triggered by repeated virus reactivations, correlated with increasing cognitive deficits becoming irreversible after seven cycles of reactivation. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that mild and recurrent HSV-1 infections in the central nervous system produce an AD-like phenotype and suggest that they are a risk factor for AD.","authors":["Giovanna De Chiara","Roberto Piacentini","Marco Fabiani","Alessia Mastrodonato"],"meta":["March 2019PLoS Pathogens 15(3):e1007617","DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1007617"],"references":["317935458_A_Novel_Method_to_Titrate_Herpes_Simplex_Virus-1_HSV-1_Using_Laser-Based_Scanning_of_Near-Infrared_Fluorophores_Conjugated_Antibodies","309270290_Herpes_Simplex_Virus-type1_HSV-1_Impairs_DNA_Repair_in_Cortical_Neurons","308130634_Amyloidogenic_amyloid-b-peptide_variants_induce_microbial_agglutination_and_exert_antimicrobial_activity","307666793_Fields_virology","303532914_Amyloid-_peptide_protects_against_microbial_infection_in_mouse_and_worm_models_of_Alzheimers_disease","299494332_The_amyloid_hypothesis_of_Alzheimer's_disease_at_25_years","326326557_Alzheimer's_Disease-Associated_b-Amyloid_Is_Rapidly_Seeded_by_Herpesviridae_to_Protect_against_Brain_Infection","318831468_Herpes_simplex_virus_type_1_and_Alzheimer's_disease_possible_mechanisms_and_signposts","310435927_Long-term_exposition_to_a_high_fat_diet_favors_the_appearance_of_b-amyloid_depositions_in_the_brain_of_C57BL6J_mice_A_potential_model_of_sporadic_Alzheimer's_disease","305678699_High_avidity_HSV-1_antibodies_correlate_with_absence_of_amnestic_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_conversion_to_Alzheimer's_disease","295902071_Anodal_transcranial_direct_current_stimulation_boosts_synaptic_plasticity_and_memory_in_mice_via_epigenetic_regulation_of_Bdnf_expression","291391626_Extracellular_Tau_Oligomers_Produce_An_Immediate_Impairment_of_LTP_and_Memory","284278224_Is_L-methionine_a_trigger_factor_for_Alzheimer's-like_neurodegeneration_Changes_in_Ab_oligomers_tau_phosphorylation_synaptic_proteins_Wnt_signaling_and_behavioral_impairment_in_wild-type_mice","283286248_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_type-1_infection_induces_synaptic_dysfunction_in_cultured_cortical_neurons_via_GSK-3_activation_and_intraneuronal_amyloid-b_protein_accumulation","292952934_Protective_Effect_of_Amyloid-b_Peptides_Against_Herpes_Simplex_Virus-1_Infection_in_a_Neuronal_Cell_Culture_Model"]}
