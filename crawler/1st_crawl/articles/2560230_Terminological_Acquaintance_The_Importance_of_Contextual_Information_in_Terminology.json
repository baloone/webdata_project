{"id":"2560230_Terminological_Acquaintance_The_Importance_of_Contextual_Information_in_Terminology","abstract":"This paper examines an idea we call terminological acquaintance, which considers the importance of contextual information for various applications in NLP. The importance of contextual information is not new to NLP, but it has rarely been considered in relation to terminological entities. Terminological contexts, however, are vast information sources waiting to be tapped, and are even more useful for domain-specific applications than for general language ones. We focus specifically on the relationships between these contexts and their neighbouring terms, and on how the relevant information from them can best be captured. We give examples of how such information can be clustered, and how this can be used for applications such as domain-specific lexical ontology development.","authors":["Diana Maynard","Sophia Ananiadou"],"meta":["July 2000"],"references":[]}
