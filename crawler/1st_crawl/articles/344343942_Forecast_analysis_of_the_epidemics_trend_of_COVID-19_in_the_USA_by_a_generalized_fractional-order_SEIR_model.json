Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number \n\nR\n0\n\nis derived. When \n\nR\n0\n\n<\n1\n\n, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When \n\nR\n0\n\n>\n1\n\n, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the USA is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model, which is divided the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, recovered, insusceptible and dead individuals. According to the real data of the USA, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the USA in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases is predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","authors":["Conghui Xu","Yongguang yu","YangQuan Chen","Zhenzhen Lu"],"meta":["August 2020Nonlinear Dynamics 101(3):1-14","DOI:10.1007/s11071-020-05946-3"],"references":["343467334_A_fractional-order_SEIHDR_model_for_COVID-19_with_inter-city_networked_coupling_effects","343136222_A_mathematical_model_of_COVID-19_using_fractional_derivative_outbreak_in_India_with_dynamics_of_transmission_and_control","340099989_Modified_SEIR_and_AI_prediction_of_the_epidemics_trend_of_COVID-19_in_China_under_public_health_interventions","339680382_A_conceptual_model_for_the_outbreak_of_Coronavirus_disease_2019_COVID-19_in_Wuhan_China_with_individual_reaction_and_governmental_action","339343754_2019_Novel_coronavirus_where_we_are_and_what_we_know","339323999_Epidemic_analysis_of_COVID-19_in_China_by_dynamical_modeling","338926289_Preliminary_estimation_of_the_basic_reproduction_number_of_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_in_China_from_2019_to_2020_A_data-driven_analysis_in_the_early_phase_of_the_outbreak","343628006_Generalized_SEIR_Epidemic_Model_fitting_and_computation","339450152_Stability_of_a_fractional_order_SEIR_model_with_general_incidence","330273959_Hopf_bifurcation_in_an_age-structured_SIR_epidemic_model","326983142_Fractional_Calculus_View_of_Complexity_Tomorrow's_Science","324738869_A_new_collection_of_real_world_applications_of_fractional_calculus_in_science_and_engineering","324520191_Analysis_of_a_fractional_SEIR_model_with_treatment","313947110_A_stochastic_SIRS_epidemic_model_with_nonlinear_incidence_rate","279288373_Global_stability_analysis_of_fractional-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_time_delay"]}
