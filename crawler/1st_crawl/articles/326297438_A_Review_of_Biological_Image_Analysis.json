{"id":"326297438_A_Review_of_Biological_Image_Analysis","abstract":"In recent years, there is an increasing number of researchers applying bioimaging techniques to generate a myriad of biological images. The growing image data pose great methodological challenges for image processing and quantitative analysis. The analyses of biological images range from the quantification of phenotypes to the visualization of biological structures. Objective: Accurate, high-throughput and quantitative biological phenotypes from images is becoming an important technique in many labs. More and more phenotype and genotype were generated, better utilization and mining connections from these data are important. This article provides an overview of the major studies based on biological images.","authors":["Weiyang Chen","Weiwei Li","Xiangjun Dong","Pei Jialun"],"meta":["July 2018Current Bioinformatics 13(4):337-343","DOI:10.2174/1574893612666170718153316"],"references":["285585225_Segmentation_of_Image_Data_from_Complex_Organotypic_3D_Models_of_Cancer_Tissues_with_Markov_Random_Fields","283544589_Mechanical_Coupling_between_Endoderm_Invagination_and_Axis_Extension_in_Drosophila","283540275_Quantitative_image_analysis_as_a_tool_for_Yarrowia_lipolytica_dimorphic_growth_evaluation_in_different_culture_media","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","305568406_Automated_cell_segmentation_with_3D_fluorescence_microscopy_images","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","285823884_The_genetics_of_ageing","284534446_Advancing_biomedical_imaging","283639942_Quantifying_morphological_features_of_actin_cytoskeletal_filaments_in_plant_cells_based_on_mathematical_morphology","283170371_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Rat_Dorsal_Root_Ganglion_Neurons_Cultured_on_Microelectrode_Arrays_Based_on_Fluorescence_Microscopy_Image_Processing"]}
