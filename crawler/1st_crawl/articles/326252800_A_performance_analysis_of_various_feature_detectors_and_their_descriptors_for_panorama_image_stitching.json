{"id":"326252800_A_performance_analysis_of_various_feature_detectors_and_their_descriptors_for_panorama_image_stitching","abstract":"Feature detectors and descriptors play an essential role in computer vision application such as image registration, object recognition, and image classification and retrieval. This paper presents the analysis of the performance of multiple feature detectors and descriptors, namely SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRIEF, BRISK, FREAK. It analyzed in terms of the number of features, the number of matching points in overlapping regions between images and subjective accuracy of stitching. Extraction of different symmetric features from image increases the chance of the requirement reliable matching among a variety of scene views. One result of the experiments shows that AGAST, FAST and BRISK detectors have the highest number of detected key points, whereas STAR, AKAZE, and MSER have a lower number of extracted key points. Moreover, the speed of each algorithm is registered.","authors":["I.H. Ali","S. Salman"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 119(15):147-161"],"references":[]}
