{"id":"330506923_Dynamic_Discretization_Discovery_for_Solving_the_Time_Dependent_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","abstract":"We present a new solution approach for the Time Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows. This problem considers a salesman who departs from his home, has to visit a number of cities within a predetermined period of time, and then returns home. The problem allows for travel times that can depend on the time of departure. We consider two objectives for the problem: (1) a makespan objective that seeks to return the salesman to his home as early as possible, and, (2) a duration objective that seeks to minimize the amount of time he is away from his home. The solution approach is based on an integer programming formulation of the problem on a time expanded network, as doing so enables time dependencies to be embedded in the definition of the network. However, as such a time expanded network (and thus the integer programming formulation) can rapidly become prohibitively large, the solution approach employs a dynamic discretization discovery framework, which has been effective in other contexts. Our computational results indicate that the solution approach outperforms the best-known methods on benchmark instances and is robust with respect to instance parameters.","authors":["Vu Duc Minh","Mike Hewitt","Natashia Boland","Martin Savelsbergh"],"meta":["January 2019Transportation Science","DOI:10.1287/trsc.2019.0911","Project: Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows"],"references":["283954809_Formulations_for_Minimizing_Tour_Duration_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","282135448_Finding_optimal_solutions_for_vehicle_routing_problem_with_pickup_and_delivery_services_with_time_windows_A_dynamic_programming_approach_based_on_state-space-time_network_representations","328797707_Time-dependent_asymmetric_traveling_salesman_problem_with_time_windows_Properties_and_an_exact_algorithm","318689137_The_Continuous-Time_Service_Network_Design_Problem","318196246_An_Integer_Programming_approach_for_the_Time-Dependent_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","299432306_Dynamic_Programming_for_the_Minimum_Tour_Duration_Problem","281786332_Time-dependent_routing_problems_A_review","274199975_Analysis_and_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Time-Dependent_Travelling_Salesman_Problem","270674128_A_Time_Bucket_Formulation_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","270634710_A_Note_on_the_Ichoua_Gendreau_and_Potvin_2003_Travel_Time_Model"]}
