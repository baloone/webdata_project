{"id":"313845605_International_Journal_of_Computer_Science","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology in the world. Devices are increasing day by day. So, people are connected with internet. IoT is sensor based technology. IoT has the role of sensing, processing and delivering of information. But, Internet of things is facing lots of issues and challenges. Particularly, security is one of the big challenges in internet of things environment. This paper deals with the security issues based on routing attacks in network. Routing attacks are the most destructive issue. The paper proposes watchdog technique to detect sinkhole attack in internet of things environment. The technique uses the successful link as parameter.","authors":["Raju Stephen","L Arockiam"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["311250306_PHYMAC_layer_attack_detection_system_using_neuro-fuzzy_algorithm_for_IoT_network","283782108_Detection_of_sinkhole_attacks_for_supporting_secure_routing_on_6LoWPAN_for_Internet_of_Things","283706490_Intrusion_Detection_System_against_Sink_Hole_Attack_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_with_Mobile_Sink","283622538_On_Resilience_of_Wireless_Mesh_Routing_Protocol_against_DoS_Attacks_in_IoT-based_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Applications","309464641_A_Misbehavior_Node_Detection_Algorithm_for_6LoWPAN_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","308709106_InDReS_An_Intrusion_Detection_and_response_system_for_Internet_of_Things_with_6LoWPAN","303673629_EyeSim_A_Mobile_Application_for_Visual-Assisted_Wormhole_Attack_Detection_in_IoT-enabled_WSNs","301258638_RAEED_A_formally_verified_solution_to_resolve_sinkhole_attack_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","286705430_Presenting_a_pattern_for_detection_of_denial_of_service_attacks_with_web_mining_technique_and_fuzzy_logic_approach","282580818_A_Taxonomy_of_Attacks_in_RPL-based_Internet_of_Things"]}
