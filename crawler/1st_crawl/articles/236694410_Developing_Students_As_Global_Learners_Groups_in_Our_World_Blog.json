{"id":"236694410_Developing_Students_As_Global_Learners_Groups_in_Our_World_Blog","abstract":"This case study investigates the use of online blogs as a teaching tool. A\ncollaborative blog was implemented in parallel classes on group processes\nin the United States and Germany. Our goal was to connect American\nand German graduate students by helping them to talk about group\ncommunication and meeting behaviors. Collected data included transcripts\nof the messages, as well as students’ evaluations of the blog (collected at the\nend of the project). Quantitative analyses assessed students’ participation\nrates and the content of their postings. Qualitative analysis examined the\nuse of the blog as a teaching and learning tool. The results showed that\nstudents interacted more on the blog than was required by the instructor.\nStudents valued blogging as a new learning experience. We discuss the\npedagogical implications of blog usage for teaching about groups and provide\nrecommendations for instructors interested in using blogs in their own\ncourses.","authors":["Annika Luisa Meinecke","Kim K.
