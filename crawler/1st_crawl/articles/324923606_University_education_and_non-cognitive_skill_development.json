{"id":"324923606_University_education_and_non-cognitive_skill_development","abstract":"We examine the effect of university education on students' non-cognitive skills (NCS) using high-quality Australian longitudinal data. To isolate the skill-building effects of tertiary education, we follow the education decisions and NCS-proxied by the Big Five personality traits-of 575 adolescents over eight years. Estimating a standard skill production function, we demonstrate a robust positive relationship between university education and extraversion, and agreeableness for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The effects are likely to operate through exposure to university life rather than through degree-specific curricula or university-specific teaching quality. As extraversion and agreeableness are associated with socially beneficial behaviours, we propose that university education may have important non-market returns.","authors":["Sonja C Kassenboehmer","Felix Leung","Stefanie Schurer"],"meta":["April 2018Oxford Economic Papers 70(2):538-562","DOI:10.1093/oep/gpy002"],"references":["311663873_Early_Maternal_Time_Investment_and_Early_Child_Outcomes","265340278_How_Different_Are_Higher_Education_Institutions_in_the_UK_US_and_Australia_The_Significance_of_Government_Involvement","263899024_Personality_and_Prosocial_Behavior_Linking_Basic_Traits_and_Social_Value_Orientations","258062122_Personality_Maturation_Around_the_World_A_Cross-Cultural_Examination_of_Social-Investment_Theory","237044956_Understanding_the_Mechanisms_Through_Which_an_Influential_Early_Childhood_Program_Boosted_Adult_Outcomes","51588000_Stability_and_Change_of_Personality_Across_the_Life_Course_The_Impact_of_Age_and_Major_Life_Events_on_Mean-Level_and_Rank-Order_Stability_of_the_Big_Five","51482482_A_Random_Walk_Down_University_Avenue_Life_Paths_Life_Events_and_Personality_Trait_Change_at_the_Transition_to_University_Life","49764225_Genetic_and_Environmental_Influences_on_Personality_Trait_Stability_and_Growth_During_the_Transition_to_Adulthood_A_Three-Wave_Longitudinal_Study","46442682_Analyzing_Social_Experiments_as_Implemented_A_Reexamination_of_the_Evidence_from_the_HighScope_Perry_Preschool_Program","12203625_SF-36_Health_Survey_update","328820834_College_What_It_Was_Is_and_Should_Be_-_Updated_Edition","321818029_Personality_IQ_and_Lifetime_Earnings","317571856_Does_education_strengthen_the_life_skills_of_adolescents","317288752_Getting_Weighed_Down_The_Effect_of_Childhood_Obesity_on_the_Development_of_Socioemotional_Skills","315891411_Origins_of_Adulthood_Personality_The_Role_of_Adverse_Childhood_Experiences","312144722_The_stability_of_personality_traits_in_adolescence_and_young_adulthood","289964055_The_Effects_of_Cognitive_and_Non-Cognitive_Abilities_on_Labor_Market_Outcomes_and_Social_Behavior","289962968_The_structure_of_phenotypic_personality_traits","285754219_How_Does_Your_Kindergarten_Classroom_Affect_Your_Earnings_Evidence_from_Project_Star","282352346_The_Medical_Care_Costs_of_Mood_Disorders_A_Coarsened_Exact_Matching_Approach","280972702_Amoral_Familism_Social_Capital_or_Trust_The_Behavioural_Foundations_of_the_Italian_North-South_Divide","278409478_How_the_Allocation_of_Children's_Time_Affects_Cognitive_and_Non-Cognitive_Development","275080001_Separating_uncertainty_from_heterogeneity_in_life_cycle_earnings","270461132_Investment_in_Human_Capital","259710119_Long-Term_Effects_of_School_Quality_on_Health_and_Lifestyle_Evidence_from_Comprehensive_Schooling_Reforms_in_England","256057030_The_College_Type_Personality_and_Educational_Inequality","254070596_The_Effects_of_Personality_Traits_on_Adult_Labor_Market_Outcomes_Evidence_From_Siblings","249674205_The_AUSEI06A_new_socioeconomic_index_for_Australia","234146008_The_Relationship_Between_Economic_Preferences_and_Psychological_Personality_Measures","232505712_The_Development_of_Markers_For_the_Big_Five_Factor_Structure","227369353_Multivariate_Matching_Methods_That_Are_Monotonic_Imbalance_Bounding","226320366_First-Generation_College_Students_Characteristics_Experiences_and_Cognitive_Development","223248147_Becoming_a_strategic_reader","222575573_The_Returns_to_Cognitive_Abilities_and_Personality_Traits_in_Germany","222574620_The_Effects_of_Personality_on_Earnings","222526718_Where_the_Boys_Aren't_Non-Cognitive_Skills_Returns_to_School_and_the_Gender_Gap_in_Higher_Education","43472818_The_generic_skills_debate_in_research_high_degrees","31237059_Matching_as_Nonparametric_Preprocessing_for_Reducing_Model_Dependence_in_Parametric_Causal_Inference","24106324_Investment_in_Human_Capital_and_Personal_Income_Distribution_Authors","24092295_Job_Market_Signaling","15353963_Mini-Markers_A_Brief_Version_of_Goldberg's_Unipolar_Big-Five_Markers","13992559_Plaster_or_Plasticity_Are_Adult_Work_Experiences_Associated_with_Personality_Change_in_Women","7840821_Altruism_Happiness_and_Health_It's_Good_to_Be_Good","5119640_Estimating_the_Effect_of_Personality_on_Male_and_Female_Earnings","5110468_2001_Lawrence_R_Klein_Lecture_Estimating_Distributions_of_Treatment_Effects_with_an_Application_to_the_Returns_to_Schooling_and_Measurement_of_the_Effects_of_Uncertainty_on_College_Choice","4981878_Human_Capital_Versus_Signalling_Explanations_of_Wages","4918427_Higher_Education_as_a_Filter","4894707_On_The_Specification_and_Estimation_of_The_Production_Function_for_Cognitive_Achievement","4720760_The_Theory_of_Screening_Education_and_the_Distribution_of_Income"]}
