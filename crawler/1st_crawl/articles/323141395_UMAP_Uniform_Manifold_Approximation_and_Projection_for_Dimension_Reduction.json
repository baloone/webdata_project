{"id":"323141395_UMAP_Uniform_Manifold_Approximation_and_Projection_for_Dimension_Reduction","abstract":"UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP as described has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.","authors":["Leland McInnes","John Healy"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["337722762_Visualizing_structure_and_transitions_in_high-dimensional_biological_data","337602487_The_art_of_using_t-SNE_for_single-cell_transcriptomics","331236536_The_single-cell_transcriptional_landscape_of_mammalian_organogenesis","330203269_Manifold_learning_of_four-dimensional_scanning_transmission_electron_microscopy","329381074_Dimensionality_reduction_for_visualizing_single-cell_data_using_UMAP","319312259_Fashion-MNIST_a_Novel_Image_Dataset_for_Benchmarking_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","331779381_Visual_Analytics_of_Multidimensional_Projections_for_Constructing_Classifier_Decision_Boundary_Maps","317425624_Clustering_with_t-SNE_Provably","316806285_Simplicial_Homotopy_Theory","313417416_A_Molecular_Census_of_Arcuate_Hypothalamus_and_Median_Eminence_Cell_Types"]}
