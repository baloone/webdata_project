{"id":"326880185_Development_of_Children's_Multiple_Intelligence_Based_on_Computer_Educational_Game_Platform","abstract":"To develop children's intelligence in a joyful way of learning, four kinds of teaching modes for the development of children's multiple intelligence in computer education games were proposed, including guidance mode, diagnosis mode, inquiry mode and practice mode. These four models basically covered the basic forms of computer education games used in teaching. On the basis of constructing a teaching model, a platform for computer educational game was designed around the multiple intelligence theory. The research results showed that the design of teaching model and game platform can play a guiding role in the development of children's multiple intelligence teaching practice. It is concluded that computer education game has a very broad prospect in preschool education.","authors":["Xueqiong Hong","Fengfeng Chen"],"meta":["August 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 394(5):052034","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/394/5/052034"],"references":["280916567_Game-based_learning_engagement_A_theory-_and_data-driven_exploration","292676571_Evaluation_of_a_Motion-Based_Platform_for_Practicing_Phonological_Awareness_of_Preschool_Children","289659900_The_use_of_augmented_reality_games_in_education_a_review_of_the_literature","284715516_The_use_of_augmented_reality_games_in_education_A_review_of_the_literature","281282116_Enhancing_Children's_Social_Emotional_Functioning_Through_Virtual_Game-Based_Delivery_of_Social_Skills_Training"]}
