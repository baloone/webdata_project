{"id":"220578095_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machine_Classifiers","abstract":"In this letter we discuss a least squares version for support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Due to equality type constraints in the formulation, the solution follows from solving a set of linear equations, instead of quadratic programming for classical SVM''s. The approach is illustrated on a two-spiral benchmark classification problem.","authors":["Johan A.K.
