{"id":"228678047_An_Efficient_Quasi-Maximum_Likelihood_Decoding_for_Finite_Constellations","abstract":"In Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems, maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding is equivalent to finding the closest lattice point in an N -dimensional complex space. In general, this algorithm is known to be NP hard. In this paper, we propose a quasi-maximum likelihood algorithm based on Semi-Definite Programming (SDP). We introduce several SDP relaxation models for MIMO systems, with increasing complexity. The resulting algorithms built on these models have near-ML performances with polynomial computational complexities.","authors":["Amin Mobasher","Mahmoud Taherzadeh","Renata Sotirov","Amir K Khandani"],"meta":["March 2005"],"references":["247456489_SDPA_SemiDefinite_Programming_Algorithm_User's_Manual_-_Version_600","50863306_Factoring_Polynomials_with_Rational_Coefficients","3319338_On_the_sphere-decoding_algorithm_I_Expected_complexity","2627645_A_New_Primal-Dual_Interior-Point_Method_for_Semidefinite_Programming","2276980_Semidefinite_Programming_Relaxations_For_The_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","254437715_Bundle_methods_in_combinatorial_optimization","233806997_Kronecker_Products_and_Matrix_Calculus","227660963_Capacity_of_Multi-antenna_Gaussian_Channels","224754286_MMSE-GDFE_lattice_decoding_for_solving_under-determined_linear_systems_with_integer_unknowns","222479733_Semidefinite_Programming_Relaxations_For_The_Graph_Partitioning_Problem"]}
