{"id":"338169104_Conventional_Vs_Enhanced_Sorting_Algorithm_A_Review","abstract":"Sorting problem is one of the most antique problems of computer science. From the beginning of computation, algorithms for sorting problem has been derived and analyzed by many researchers. The first sorting algorithm derived was bubble sort (1956). Many useful sorting algorithms are continually being invented like Merge sort, Timsort (2002), Library sort (2006). A vast number of sorting algorithms and their enhancements exists in the literature. One would really like to know that these enhancements of sorting algorithms are actually better than the conventional sorting algorithms. For this purpose authors have taken a case of classical merge sort and enhanced merge sort algorithm proposed by paira et al [12]. authors have tested the performance of both the algorithms using different random number distributions and found that there is no significant difference between the algorithms.","authors":["Pooja Gupta"],"meta":["December 2019"],"references":[]}
