{"id":"232442244_Rank_order_as_a_psycho-physical_method","abstract":"The author believes that the constant method in its ideal form is that of paired comparisons \"in which not one but all of the stimuli serve as standards.\" To reduce the labor of the extended series of comparisons necessary and to obviate the limitations when only one or two stimuli are used as standards, the author proposes a plan whereby, excluding intermediate category judgments, simple absolute rank order may be used in lieu of the laborious constant process method. \"Given the data for absolute rank order we shall extract the proportion of judgments 'A > B' for every possible pair of stimuli in the given series. These derived proportions will be used instead of the proportions that are obtained directly in the constant method. From these derived proportions the subjective separations between any pair of stimuli can then be readily calculated by the equation of comparative judgment.\" The data of Kate Hevner's dissertation, 370 handwriting specimens, were compared as to an order of merit arrangement and the method of paired comparisons. The two methods were found to give identical results when treated by the equation of comparative judgment. The fundamental assumption of zero correlation between discriminal errors of two specimens is verified, and it is also shown that the proportion of \"greater than\" judgments can be obtained directly from a frequency table of rank orders for each specimen, thus saving the laborious tabulation of all the \nn(n - 1) judgments for each subject implied in his arrangement of the \nn stimuli in a single rank order.
