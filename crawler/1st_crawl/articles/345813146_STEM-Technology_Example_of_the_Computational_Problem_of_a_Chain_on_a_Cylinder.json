{"id":"345813146_STEM-Technology_Example_of_the_Computational_Problem_of_a_Chain_on_a_Cylinder","abstract":"Considered the problem of the parameters of a closed-chain (with and without load) thrown over a horizontal cylinder. The numerical solution is found and its graphical interpretation is made by compiling a system of transcendental equations, as well as carrying out numerical optimization with constraints. The approximating analytical dependence is determined using the fitting functions. In the process of solving a number of concepts from mathematics, physics, computer science are examined. Some possibilities of using specialized mathematical packages and of working on online platforms are shown. Additional problems options for using STEM technology are presented.","authors":["Valery Ochkov","K. A. Orlov","Inna Vasileva","Evgeny V.
