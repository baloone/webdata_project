{"id":"345434127_Security_and_Privacy_Trends_in_the_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"This book, written by leaders in the protection field of critical infrastructures, provides an extended overview of the technological and operative advantages together with the security problems and challenges of the new paradigm of the Internet of Things in todayâ€™s industry, also known as the Industry Internet of Things (IIoT). \nThe incorporation of the new embedded technologies and the interconnected networking advances in the automation and monitoring processes, certainly multiplies the functional complexities of the underlying control system, whilst increasing security and privacy risks. The critical nature of the application context and its relevance for the well-being of citizens and their economy, attracts the attention of multiple, advanced attackers, with stealthy abilities to evade security policies, ex-filter information or exploit vulnerabilities. Some real-life events and registers in CERTs have already clearly demonstrated how the control industry can become vulnerable to multiple types of advanced threats whose focus consists in hitting the safety and security of the control processes. \nThis book, therefore, comprises a detailed spectrum of research papers with highly analytical content and actuation procedures to cover the relevant security and privacy issues such as data protection, awareness, response and resilience, all of them working at optimal times. Readers will be able to comprehend the construction problems of the fourth industrial revolution and are introduced to effective, lightweight protection solutions which can be integrated as part of the new IIoT-based monitoring ecosystem.","authors":["Cristina Alcaraz"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-12330-7","ISBN: 978-3-030-12329-1"],"references":[]}
