{"id":"305973922_A_deterministic_epidemic_model_taking_account_of_repeated_contacts_between_the_same_individuals","abstract":"We introduce a certain population contact structure and derive, in three different ways, the final size equation for a quite general superimposed epidemic process. The contact structure is characterized by the following two properties: (i) each individual contacts exactly k other individuals; (ii) these k acquaintances are a random sample of the (infinite) population.","authors":["Odo Diekmann","Mart C.M.
