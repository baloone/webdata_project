{"id":"261108195_Fast_Shared_On-Chip_Memory_Architecture_for_Efficient_Hybrid_Computing_with_CGRAs","abstract":"While Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) are very efficient at handling regular, compute-intensive loops, their weakness at control-intensive processing and the need for frequent reconfiguration require another processor, for which usually a main processor is used. To minimize the overhead arising in such collaborative execution, we integrate a dedicated sequential processor (SP) with a reconfigurable array (RA), where the crucial problem is how to share the memory between SP and RA while keeping the SP's memory access latency very short. We present a detailed architecture, control, and program example of our approach, focusing on our optimized on-chip shared memory organization between SP and RA. Our preliminary results demonstrate that our optimized memory architecture is very effective in reducing kernel execution times (23.5% compared to a more straightforward alternative), and our approach can reduce the RA control overhead and other sequential code execution time in kernels significantly, resulting in up to 23.1% reduction in kernel execution time, compared to the conventional system using the main processor for sequential code execution.","authors":["Jongeun Lee","Yeonghun Jeong","Sungsok Seo"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.7873/DATE.2013.320","Conference: Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2013"],"references":["255633818_CACTI_60_A_Tool_to_Understand_Large_Caches","221224497_VEGAS_Soft_vector_processor_with_scratchpad_memory","221005559_MediaBench_A_Tool_for_Evaluating_and_Synthesizing_Multimedia_and_Communicatons_Systems","220952896_Mapping_of_Regular_Nested_Loop_Programs_to_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Arrays_-_Constraints_and_Methodology","220914838_VLIW-SCORE_Beyond_C_for_sequential_control_of_SPICE_FPGA_acceleration","220884752_Edge-centric_modulo_scheduling_for_coarse-grained_reconfigurable_architectures","3940924_MiBench_A_free_commercially_representative_embedded_benchmark_suite","3216513_A_Coarse-Grained_Array_Accelerator_for_Software-Defined_Radio_Baseband_Processing","3044209_MorphoSys_An_integrated_reconfigurable_system_for_data-parallel_and_computation-intensive_applications","2955585_SimpleScalar_An_Infrastructure_for_Computer_System_Modeling","2670945_MediaBench_A_Tool_for_Evaluating_and_Synthesizing_Multimedia_and_Communications_Systems","221474575_SD-VBS_The_san_diego_vision_benchmark_suite","221148006_The_microarchitecture_of_FPGA-based_soft_processors","220759682_ADRES_An_Architecture_with_Tightly_Coupled_VLIW_Processor_and_Coarse-Grained_Reconfigurable_Matrix","220244730_DRAMsim_A_memory-system_simulator","220169944_Improving_Performance_of_Nested_Loops_on_Reconfigurable_Array_Processors","3713650_A_MIPS_Processor_with_a_Reconfigurable_Coprocessor"]}
