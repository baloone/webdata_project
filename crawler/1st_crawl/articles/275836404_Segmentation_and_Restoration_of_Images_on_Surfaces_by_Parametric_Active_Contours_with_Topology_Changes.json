{"id":"275836404_Segmentation_and_Restoration_of_Images_on_Surfaces_by_Parametric_Active_Contours_with_Topology_Changes","abstract":"In this article, a new method for segmentation and restoration of images on\ntwo-dimensional surfaces is given. Active contour models for image segmentation\nare extended to images on surfaces. The evolving curves on the surfaces are\nmathematically described using a parametric approach. For image restoration, a\ndiffusion equation with Neumann boundary conditions is solved in a\npostprocessing step in the individual regions. Numerical schemes are presented\nwhich allow to efficiently compute segmentations and denoised versions of\nimages on surfaces. Also topology changes of the evolving curves are detected\nand performed using a fast sub-routine. Finally, several experiments are\npresented where the developed methods are applied on different artificial and\nreal images defined on different surfaces.","authors":["Heike Frei","Harald Garcke"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 55(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-015-0616-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258291542_New_fast_and_stable_Lagrangean_method_for_image_segmentation","319770210_Introduction_to_Smooth_Manifolds","313617603_Lagrangean_method_with_topological_changes_for_numerical_modelling_of_forest_fire_propagation","313574535_Intrinsic_scale_space_for_images_on_surfaces_The_geodesic_curvature_flow","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","289190937_Image_segmentation_on_implicit_surface_based_on_Chan-Vese_model","284653608_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","277551253_Algorithm_832","275982913_Introduction_to_Differentiable_Manifolds","259432164_Finite_element_methods_for_surface_PDEs"]}
