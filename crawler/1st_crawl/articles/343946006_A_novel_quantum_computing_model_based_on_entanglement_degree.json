{"id":"343946006_A_novel_quantum_computing_model_based_on_entanglement_degree","abstract":"This paper shows a novel quantum computing model that solves quantum computing problems based on the degree of entanglement. We show two main theorems: the first theorem shows the quantum circuit that can be used to quantify the concurrence value between two adjacent qubits. The second theorem shows the quantum circuit of a proposed operator, called [Formula: see text] operator, which can be used to differentiate between the non-orthogonal states in the form [Formula: see text], with arbitrary accuracy, using the concurrence value. Then, the mathematical machinery for implementing the proposed model and its techniques using the circuit model is investigated extensively.","authors":["Mohammed Zidan"],"meta":["August 2020Modern Physics Letters B 34(35):2050401","DOI:10.1142/S0217984920504011"],"references":["335088712_A_Quantum_Algorithm_Based_on_Entanglement_Measure_for_Classifying_Boolean_Multivariate_function_into_Novel_Hidden_Classes","335020368_A_Novel_Autonomous_Perceptron_Model_for_Pattern_Classification_Applications","332223480_Quantum_Classification_Algorithm_Based_on_Competitive_Learning_Neural_Network_and_Entanglement_Measure","328251775_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol_Based_on_Modified_Generalization_of_Deutsch-Jozsa_Algorithm_in_d-level_Quantum_System","281673203_Concurrence_Measurement_for_the_Two-Qubit_Optical_and_Atomic_States","7155659_Experimental_determination_of_entanglement_with_a_single_measurement","2199413_Experimental_Quantum_Teleportation_of_a_Two-Qubit_Composite_System","338285134_A_quantum_classification_algorithm_for_classification_incomplete_patterns_based_on_entanglement_measure","334972795_The_fog_on_Generalized_teleportation_by_means_of_discrete-Time_quantum_walks_on_N-lines_and_N-cycles","321260698_Low-cost_autonomous_perceptron_neural_network_inspired_by_quantum_computation","273961721_Quantum_computing_with_photons_Introduction_to_the_circuit_model_the_one-way_quantum_computer_and_the_fundamental_principles_of_photonic_experiments","260940426_Quantum_metrology","231071696_Application_of_quantum_algorithms_to_direct_measurement_of_concurrence_of_a_two-qubit_pure_state","230991745_Degree_of_entanglement_for_anisotropic_coupled_oscillators_interacting_with_a_single_atom","228109531_Rapid_Solution_of_Problems_by_Quantum_Computation","13375764_Shor_P_W_Scheme_for_reducing_decoherence_in_quantum_computer_memory_Phys_Rev_A_52_R2493-R2496"]}
