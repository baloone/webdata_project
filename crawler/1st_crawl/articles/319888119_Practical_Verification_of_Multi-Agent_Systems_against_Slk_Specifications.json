{"id":"319888119_Practical_Verification_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_against_Slk_Specifications","abstract":"We introduce Strategy Logic with Knowledge, a novel formalism to reason about knowledge and strategic ability in memoryless multi-agent systems with incomplete information. We exemplify its expressive power; we define the model checking problem for the logic and show that it is PSpace-complete. We propose a labelling algorithm for solving the verification problem that we show is amenable to symbolic implementation. We introduce (black small square), an extension of the open-source model checker MCMAS, implementing the proposed algorithm. We report the benchmarks obtained on a number of scenarios from the literature, including the dining cryptographers protocol.","authors":["Petr Čermák","Alessio Lomuscio","Fabio Mogavero","Aniello Murano"],"meta":["August 2018Information and Computation 261(Part 3):588-614","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2017.09.011"],"references":["303617687_MCMAS_an_open-source_model_checker_for_the_verification_of_multi-agent_systems","284044719_AUTOMATA-THEORETIC_APPROACH_TO_AUTOMATIC_PROGRAM_VERIFICATION","279659585_Reasoning_About_Substructures_and_Games","269994338_Verifying_and_Synthesising_Multi-Agent_Systems_against_One-Goal_Strategy_Logic_Specifications","269994102_Reasoning_About_Strategies_On_the_Model-Checking_Problem","260595384_Rational_Play_and_Rational_Beliefs_under_Uncertainty","309697936_Abstraction_in_model_checking_multi-agent_systems","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","261439735_Symbolic_Model_Checking_Epistemic_Strategy_Logic"]}
