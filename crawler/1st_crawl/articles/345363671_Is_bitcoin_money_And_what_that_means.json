{"id":"345363671_Is_bitcoin_money_And_what_that_means","abstract":"In a recent article, Yermack (2015) argues that bitcoin is not money because it functions poorly as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. We offer a more conventional view. We maintain that the standard approach classifies an item as money if and only if it functions as a commonly-accepted medium of exchange. Then, we show that the demand for bitcoin is comparable to the demand for many government-issued monies. Finally, we argue that bitcoin is moneyâ€”though perhaps only over a relatively small domain at present.","authors":["Peter K. Hazlett","William J.
