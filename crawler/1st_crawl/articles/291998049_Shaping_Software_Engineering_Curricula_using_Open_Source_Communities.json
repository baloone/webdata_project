{"id":"291998049_Shaping_Software_Engineering_Curricula_using_Open_Source_Communities","abstract":"This paper documents four years of a novel approach to teaching a two-course sequence in software engineering as part of the ABET-accredited computer science curriculum at the College of Charleston. This approach is team-based and centers on learning software engineering in the context of open source software projects. In the first course, teams develop automated testing frameworks for their chosen free open source software (FOSS) project, and in the second course, team members join and contribute to a selected open source project, documenting the process through regular blog and wiki posts and an oral presentation. Results point to the transformative nature of such coursework on studentsâ€™ perception of software engineering. Discussion focuses on potential future iterations of this capstone model.","authors":["James F Bowring","Quinn Burke"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Interactive Learning Research 27(1):5-26","Project: Software Engineering Education"],"references":["282298917_Lessons_Learned_From_Teaching_Open_Source_Software_Development","244457271_Design_Experiments_in_Educational_Research","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","289920496_Student_software_engineering_learning_via_participation_in_Humanitarian_FOSS_projects","271429289_Design_Research_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Issues","269539593_The_Research_Act_A_Theoretical_Introduction_to_Sociological_Methods","265092033_Toward_a_Design_Science_of_Education","262292210_An_undergraduate_degree_in_data_science_Curriculum_and_a_decade_of_implementation_experience","262201757_Alternatives_to_lecture_Revealing_the_power_of_peer_instruction_and_cooperative_learning","247976242_The_Research_Art_in_Sociology_A_Theoretical_Introduction_to_Sociological_Methods"]}
