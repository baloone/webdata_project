{"id":"341140226_Modeling_as_Computational_Thinking_Language_Developing_a_Reference_Framework","abstract":"Modeling or building models is a widely spread concept that includes several competences relevant for every domain. Our Erasmus+ project \"Modeling at school\", hence, aims at integrating modeling techniques from the field of computer science such as class or activity diagrams in order to support teaching and learning in all subjects and levels of primary and secondary education. On the one hand, we introduce modeling as effective and brain-based learning strategy and, on the other hand, we use it as language that expresses, describes and trains computational thinking integrated in everyday life situations and topics. This paper describes the development of a reference framework following the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) that will serve as guideline and assessment tool for teachers without computer science background, who teach the Austrian curriculum \"Basic Digital Education\".","authors":["Barbara Sabitzer","Heike Demarle-Meusel","Marina Rottenhofer"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1145/3383923.3383960","Conference: ICEIT 2020: 2020 9th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology"],"references":["302377856_Language_Education_in_Europe_The_Common_European_Framework_of_Reference","228040206_Mental_Models_in_Cognitive_Science","220690137_Didaktik_der_Informatik_-_Grundlagen_Konzepte_Beispiele","36410018_Strictly_models_and_objects_first_-_Unterrichtskonzept_und_-methodik_fur_objektorientierte_Modellierung_im_Informatikunterricht","316099836_Informatische_Modellbildung_modellieren_von_Modellen_als_ein_zentrales_Element_der_Informatik_fur_den_allgemeinbildenden_Schulunterricht","308819529_Modeling_A_computer_science_concept_for_general_education","292653645_How_the_ELL_brain_learns","262257459_Competence_Measurement_and_Informatics_Standards_in_Secondary_Education","260118942_Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages_Learning_Teaching_Assessment","220352650_Entwicklung_eines_Kompetenzrahmenmodells_-_Informatisches_Modellieren_und_Systemverstandnis"]}
