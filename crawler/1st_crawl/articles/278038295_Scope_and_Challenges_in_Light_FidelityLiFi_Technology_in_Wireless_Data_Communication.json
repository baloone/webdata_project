The advantage of this device is that in addition to their lightening capabilities, it can be used for data transmissions as well. In the present study, the authors have made an exhaustive study on technology of Li-Fi and its applications in transferring data from one computer to another computer. The authors have also made study on advantages as well as disadvantages of using Li-Fi in transferring data from one computer to another computer. The massive use of Li-Fi may solve some bottleneck of data transmission in Wi-Fi technology. Finally the authors have also tried to explore the future scope of this new technology for using visible light as the carrier in data transmission and networking.","authors":["Shubham Chatterjee","Shalabh Agarwal","Asoke Nath"],"meta":["June 2015"],"references":["312410810_Li-Fi_light_Fidelity_the_future_technology_in_wireless_communication","308883094_Wireless_Communication_using_Li-Fi_Technology","261383563_Novel_Unipolar_Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiplexing_U-OFDM_for_Optical_Wireless","220761573_Visible_light_communication_for_intelligent_transportation_in_road_safety_applications"]}
