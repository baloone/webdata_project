{"id":"221539175_Modelling_Legal_Reasoning_in_a_Mathematical_Environment_through_Model-Theoretic_Semantics","abstract":"We introduce a mathematical model of legal reasoning using an underlying conditional logic semantics, to allow its tractability in some special cases. The main idea is to capture the entailment of legal consequences through a model of 0-1 programming. For such task, first we model legal reasoning with Lehmann's Lexicographic semantics and then we translate it to an instance of weighted MAXSAT problem, in order to compute the logical consequences of legal reasoning. Hence, combinatorial optimization algorithms can be used to yield the legal consequences of defeasible reasoning over legal conditional knowledge bases.","authors":["Samuel M.
