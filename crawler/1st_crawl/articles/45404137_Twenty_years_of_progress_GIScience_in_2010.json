{"id":"45404137_Twenty_years_of_progress_GIScience_in_2010","abstract":"It is 20 years since the term “geographic information science” was suggested to encompass the set of fundamental research issues that surround GIS. Two decades of GIScience have produced a range of accomplishments, in an expanding literature of research results as well as in the infrastructure of research. Several themes are suggested for future research, based both on gaps in what has been accomplished thus far, and on technology trends that will themselves raise research questions.","authors":["Michael Goodchild"],"meta":["July 2010Journal of Spatial Information Science 1(1)","DOI:10.5311/JOSIS.2010.1.2"],"references":["289932376_Ontological_Foundations_for_Geographic_Information_Science","272791441_GIS_Tool_or_Science_Demystifying_the_Persistent_Ambiguity_of_GIS_as_a_Tool_versus_Science","262404508_Towards_A_General_Theory_of_Geographic_Representation_in_GIS","316648757_Learning_to_Think_Spatially_GIS_as_a_Support_System_in_the_K-12_Curriculum","300058255_Cognitive_and_Linguistic_Aspects_of_Geographic_Space_An_Introduction","292519874_Theoretical_geography_1962_William_Bunge","287841484_Geographically_weighted_regression_the_analysis_of_spatially_varying_relationships","285696201_Effects_of_point_error_on_area_calculations_A_statistical_model","270618322_Geographically_Weighted_Regression_The_Analysis_of_Spatially_Varying_Relationships_review","270331974_A_New_Social_Atlas_of_Britain"]}
