{"id":"264084926_A_Comparative_Study_of_Meta-heuristic_Algorithms_for_Solving_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","abstract":"Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization\nproblem, therefore, solving the QAP requires applying one or more of the\nmeta-heuristic algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study between\nMeta-heuristic algorithms: Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, and Simulated\nannealing for solving a real-life (QAP) and analyze their performance in terms\nof both runtime efficiency and solution quality. The results show that Genetic\nAlgorithm has a better solution quality while Tabu Search has a faster\nexecution time in comparison with other Meta-heuristic algorithms for solving\nQAP.","authors":["Gamal Abd El-Nasser A.
