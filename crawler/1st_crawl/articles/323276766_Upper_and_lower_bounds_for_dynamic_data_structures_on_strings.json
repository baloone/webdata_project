{"id":"323276766_Upper_and_lower_bounds_for_dynamic_data_structures_on_strings","abstract":"We consider a range of simply stated dynamic data structure problems on strings. An update changes one symbol in the input and a query asks us to compute some function of the pattern of length $m$ and a substring of a longer text. We give both conditional and unconditional lower bounds for variants of exact matching with wildcards, inner product, and Hamming distance computation via a sequence of reductions. As an example, we show that there does not exist an $O(m^{1/2-\\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for a large range of these problems unless the online Boolean matrix-vector multiplication conjecture is false. We also provide nearly matching upper bounds for most of the problems we consider.","authors":["Raphael Clifford","Allan Gr√∏nlund","Kasper Green Larsen","Tatiana Starikovskaya"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["314819575_Verifying_candidate_matches_in_sparse_and_wildcard_matching","314797423_Crossing_the_Logarithmic_Barrier_for_Dynamic_Boolean_Data_Structure_Lower_Bounds","312435517_Which_Regular_Expression_Patterns_Are_Hard_to_Match","312078200_Faster_Online_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication","309663328_A_Dichotomy_for_Regular_Expression_Membership_Testing","308846160_Tight_Hardness_Results_for_LCS_and_Other_Sequence_Similarity_Measures","301268096_Higher_Lower_Bounds_from_the_3SUM_Conjecture","284579459_Unifying_and_Strengthening_Hardness_for_Dynamic_Problems_via_the_Online_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_Conjecture","271855479_Quadratic_Conditional_Lower_Bounds_for_String_Problems_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","269040603_Edit_Distance_Cannot_Be_Computed_in_Strongly_Subquadratic_Time_unless_SETH_is_false"]}
