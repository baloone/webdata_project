{"id":"335483692_What_Do_We_Do_When_We_Teach_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Many UK higher education institutions offer software engineering programmes, but the purpose and relevance of these programmes within computing science departments is not always obvious. The reality is that while advanced economies require many more skilled software engineers, universities are not delivering them. This is at least true in the context of the United Kingdom, where there are high numbers of software engineering vacancies and unemployed software engineering graduates. A possible explanation could be that curriculum content of software engineering programmes in universities needs to be reconsidered to meet the needs of industry. However, reconsidering curriculum content alone is unlikely to be transformative as there is little to be gained from changing to an emerging methodology, language or framework. Instead, an alternative direction could be to reconsider curriculum delivery and the identity of software engineering within computing science itself. In this paper, we contextualise the challenge by considering the history of software engineering education and some of its key developments. We then consider some of the alternative delivery approaches, before arguing cooperative programmes provide a opportunity for institutions to reconsider software engineering education.","authors":["Joseph Maguire","Steve Draper","Quintin Cutts"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.1145/3351287.3351295","Conference: the 1st UK & Ireland Computing Education Research Conference"],"references":["335363544_Industry_Trends_in_Software_Engineering_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","331319861_Industry_trends_in_Software_Engineering_Education_a_systematic_mapping_study","271764491_Software_Design_Studio_A_Practical_Example","266656687_Investigating_the_skill_gap_between_graduating_students_and_industry_expectations","265163421_A_Multi-Pronged_Approach_to_Work_Integrated_Learning_for_IT_Students","260044882_Student_Work_Placement_Friend_or_Foe_A_study_of_the_perceptions_of_university_students_on_industrial_work_placement","254340081_Is_Forcing_Them_Worth_the_Effort_Benefits_of_Mandatory_Internships_For_Graduates_From_Diverse_Family_Backgrounds_at_Labour_Market_Entry","239667177_A_Model_of_Work-Based_Learning","238077951_Software_development_an_attainable_goal_for_sustainable_economic_growth_in_developing_nations_the_Nigeria_experience","236165289_Studios_in_Software_Engineering_Education_Towards_an_Evaluable_Model","234771823_A_course_on_software_engineering_techniques","225755656_Knowledge_Cultures_and_the_Shaping_of_Work-based_Learning_The_Case_of_Computer_Engineering","221537616_Struggles_of_new_college_graduates_in_their_first_software_development_job","220689892_The_Mythical_Man-Month_Essays_on_Software_Engineering","3864314_Twenty_dirty_tricks_to_train_software_engineers","345403993_Teaching_software_engineering_at_university","334579432_Devising_Work-based_Learning_Curricula_with_Apprentice_Research_Software_Engineers","330018710_Success_through_Failure_The_Paradox_of_Design","326214214_Success_through_Failure_The_Paradox_of_Design","311468688_Finding_a_history_for_software_engineering","305295593_Teaching_software_development_in_a_studio_environment","305260146_A_course_on_software_engineering_techniques","300116260_ACM_Curriculum_Reports","295909257_The_Million-Dollar_Question_Can_Internships_Boost_Employment","283103144_A_systematic_mapping_study_on_practical_approaches_to_teaching_software_engineering","277951896_Understanding_successful_sandwich_placements_A_Bourdieusian_approach","266653558_Gaps_between_industry_expectations_and_the_abilities_of_graduates","266316410_The_Computer_Boys_Take_Over_Computers_Programmers_and_the_Politics_of_Technical_Expertise_History_of_Computing","262277777_Computer_technology_at_Case","257016048_Software_engineering_and_computer_science_the_impending_split","255675900_Computer_education_past_present_and_future","247877033_The_Failure_of_the_Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge","245289924_Failure_as_Source_of_Engineering_Judgment_Case_of_John_Roebling","239550637_The_Mythical_Man-Month_Essay_on_Software_Engineering","237454796_Application_Software_for_Insurance_in_the_1960s_and_Early_1970s","235196105_SEI_Report_on_Undergraduate_Software_Engineering_Education_for_1990","234816591_Report_on_a_conference_of_university_computing_center_directors_June_2-4_1960","234756360_The_Engineering_Institute_Bridging_Practice_and_Potential","234178317_The_History_of_Apollo_On-Board_Guidance_Navigation_and_Control","224398101_Software_engineering_in_a_first_degree","222882075_Collaborative_pre-competitive_RD_and_the_firm_1","222863877_Teaching_Software_Engineering_at_University","221560677_Finding_a_History_for_Software_Engineering","221538918_Teaching_software_development_in_a_studio_environment","220425566_Curriculum_68_Recommendations_for_academic_programs_in_computer_science_A_report_of_the_ACM_curriculum_committee_on_computer_science","220376890_The_reflective_practitioner_perspective_in_software_engineering_education","220300573_Forging_a_Discipline_An_Outline_History_of_software_Engineering_Education","213881760_Notes_on_Structured_Programming","3895429_The_Software_Factory_combining_undergraduate_computer_science_and_software_engineering_education","3640426_Software_engineering_education_from_an_engineering_perspective","3588490_The_software_engineering_initiative_the_past_and_the_future","3437572_Teaching_Robust_Programming","3331325_A_Brief_History_of_Software_Engineering","3331127_Computer_Science_Curriculum_Developments_in_the_1960s","3330934_Finding_a_History_for_Software_Engineering"]}
