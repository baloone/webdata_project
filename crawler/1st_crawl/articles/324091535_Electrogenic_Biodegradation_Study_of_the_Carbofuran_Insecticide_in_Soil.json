{"id":"324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","abstract":"In the development of this project the Carbofuran degradation was studied (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-benzofuran-7-yl-methylcarbamate) in soil, during a 28 days period. The trials were made under natural conditions (control) and conditions using electrodes in a sediment microbial Fuel Cell (SMFC). The affinity between the pesticide and the graphite electrode directly conditioned the results obtained in this research. Thus, a percentage of pollutant recovery obtained from the soil was seven times bigger with the natural degradation treatment not electrogenically simulated than in the case of the electrogenic treatment. This difference disclosed a low efficiency in the pesticide degradation. Studies of recovering were complemented with ecotoxicity trials, using aquatic algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). The growth inhibition in all treatments decreased with the incubation time. For the control treatment, in the absence of electrodes, and despite not detecting Carbofuran at the end of the test, an inhibition of the algal growth of 37.6% was reached. This result suggested the presence of toxic metabolites in the soil extract, probably because of a partial degradation of the pollutant.","authors":["Luis Carlos","Luis Carlos Losada Benavides","Luis Carvajal","Ruthber Rodriguez"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Applied Engineering Research 13(3)","Project: Industrial Power Systems"],"references":["318600784_Natural_Reserves_of_Civil_Society_as_Strategic_Ecosystems_Case_Study_Meremberg","313822935_PROTOTYPE_DESIGNING_AND_OPERATIONAL_ASPECTS_OF_MICROBIAL_FUEL_CELL_-_REVIEW_PAPER","308978531_Assessment_of_the_performance_of_SMFCs_in_the_bioremediation_of_PAHs_in_contaminated_marine_sediments_under_different_redox_conditions_and_analysis_of_the_associated_microbial_communities","297320192_Toxicology_of_Organophosphate_Carbamate_Compounds","262754711_Validation_of_an_analytical_method_for_carbofuran_determination_on_soils_by_high_performance_liquid_chromatography_with_UV_detection_HPLC-UV","336393603_Metodos_para_determinar_Carbofuran_23-dihidr0-22-_dimetilbenzofuran-7-il_metilcarbamato","316079799_Energy_sustainability_of_Microbial_Fuel_Cell_MFC_A_case_study","313056798_Effect_of_sorption-desorption_and_diffusion_processes_on_the_kinetics_of_biodegradation_of_organic_chemicals_in_soil","260340714_Rice_straw-derived_activated_carbons_for_the_removal_of_carbofuran_from_an_aqueous_solution","259317505_Microbial-electrochemical_bioremediation_and_detoxification_of_dibenzothiophene-polluted_soil"]}
