{"id":"334757423_Why_you_shouldn't_build_your_own_game_engine","abstract":"Developing a modern game engine from the ground up has become an increasingly rare opportunity, and with good reason. It is a costly commitment and coupled with the existing technologies readily available at reasonable pricing models, it is a hard sell for any startup to take on such a burden.\nThis paper focuses on a few key issues when developing such a technology base to serve as both a guide and a warning. Rather than discussing the implementation details and features of the engine, the paper will delve into the importance of efficient workflows; the challenges of outsourcing, and finally the lessons learned from building the technology and a game that runs on it.","authors":["Andr√©s Rivela"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3306307.3328180","Conference: ACM SIGGRAPH 2019 Talks"],"references":[]}
