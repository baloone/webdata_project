{"id":"224969497_Principles_of_GNSS_Inertial_and_Multisensor_Integrated_Navigation_Systems_Second_Edition","abstract":"Capturing a wave of innovation and creativity in the field, this greatly expanded edition of\nPrinciples of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems combines a comprehensive\nreview of the latest navigation and positioning technologies with clear explanations of their\nunderlying principles and details on how to integrate technologies for maximum accuracy and reliability.\nGlobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS), inertial navigation, terrestrial radio positioning, odometry,\npedestrian dead reckoning, magnetic heading determination, image-based navigation, and\nmap matching are explained alongside a host of other technologies suitable for air, land, sea,\nunderwater, indoor, and space navigation and positioning. As well as providing in-depth coverage\nof INS/GNSS and multisensor integration, the book describes fault detection and integrity monitoring,\ndiscusses design and testing, and incorporates the latest thinking on context-dependent and\ncooperative positioning.\nThe accompanying DVD includes MATLABÂ® INS/GNSS simulation software, extensive appendices,\nworked examples, and problems.\nProviding expert guidance for engineers, researchers, educators, and students in navigation and\npositioning, this book helps readers:\n- Design, develop, and debug INS/GNSS, and multisensor integrated navigation systems;\n- Select the right combination of technology and sensors to meet the requirements of particular\nnavigation or positioning applications;\n- Make more informed engineering and application decisions by better understanding the characteristics,\nperformance, and errors of different positioning technologies.","authors":["Paul Groves"],"meta":["March 2013","Publisher: Artech House"],"references":[]}
