{"id":"317523407_Meta-Graph_Based_Recommendation_Fusion_over_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","abstract":"Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a natural and general representation of data in modern large commercial recommender systems which involve heterogeneous types of data. HIN based recommenders face two problems: how to represent the high-level semantics of recommendations and how to fuse the heterogeneous information to make recommendations. In this paper, we solve the two problems by first introducing the concept of meta-graph to HIN-based recommendation, and then solving the information fusion problem with a \" matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM) \" approach. For the similarities generated by each meta-graph, we perform standard MF to generate latent features for both users and items. With different meta-graph based features, we propose a group lasso regularized FM to automatically learn from the observed ratings to effectively select useful meta-graph based features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Yelp, show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommendation algorithms.","authors":["Huan Zhao","Quanming Yao","Jianda Li","Yangqiu Song"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3097983.3098063","Conference: KDD 2017At: Halifax, Nova Scotia - Canada"],"references":["317083802_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","315116267_Accelerated_and_Inexact_Soft-Impute_for_Large-Scale_Matrix_and_Tensor_Completion","308030178_On_Transductive_Classification_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","305881437_Efficient_Learning_with_a_Family_of_Nonconvex_Regularizers_by_Redistributing_Nonconvexity","303697788_Meta_Structure_Computing_Relevance_in_Large_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","345756051_PathSelClus_Integrating_Meta-Path_Selection_with_User-Guided_Object_Clustering_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","312453300_Proximal_algorithms","307573604_Field-aware_Factorization_Machines_for_CTR_Prediction","305638407_Meta-Prod2Vec_-_Product_Embeddings_Using_Side-Information_for_Recommendation","304494685_Probabilistic_matrix_factorization"]}
