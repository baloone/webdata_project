{"id":"301276894_Survey_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_used_in_Healthcare_Domain","abstract":"Health care industry produces enormous quantity of data that clutches complex information relating to patients and their medical conditions. Data mining is gaining popularity in different research arenas due to its infinite applications and methodologies to mine the information in correct manner. Data mining techniques have the capabilities to discover hidden patterns or relationships among the objects in the medical data. In last decade, there has been increase in usage of data mining techniques on medical data for determining useful trends or patterns that are used in analysis and decision making. Data mining has an infinite potential to utilize healthcare data more efficiently and effectually to predict different kind of disease. This paper features various Data Mining techniques such as classification, clustering, association and also highlights related work to analyse and predict human disease.","authors":["Sheenal Hardik Patel","Hardik Patel"],"meta":["March 2016International Journal of Information Sciences and Techniques 6(1/2):53-60","DOI:10.5121/ijist.2016.6206"],"references":["261428234_Mining_medical_data_to_identify_frequent_diseases_using_Apriori_algorithm","261053678_A_diagnostic_software_tool_for_skin_diseases_with_basic_and_weighted_K-NN","228975672_Feature_selection_using_FCBF_in_type_II_diabetes_databases","224573931_Bayesian_Network_Model_for_Diagnosis_of_Psychiatric_Diseases","285743124_Medical_data_mining_using_BGA_and_RGA_for_weighting_of_features_in_fuzzy_K-NN_classification","235720350_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Data_Mining_Towards_a_Unifying_Framework","232631972_Combination_Data_Mining_Methods_with_New_Medical_Data_to_Predicting_Outcome_of_Coronary_Heart_Disease","224064160_Research_and_Application_of_Data_Mining_in_Traditional_Chinese_Medical_Clinic_Diagnosis","221378698_Medical_data_mining_model_for_oriental_medicine_via_BYY_Binary_Independent_Factor_Analysis","220766599_Mining_Infrequent_Causal_Associations_in_Electronic_Health_Databases","220426710_The_KDD_Process_for_Extracting_Useful_Knowledge_from_Volumes_of_Data","220218501_Applying_decision_tree_and_neural_network_to_increase_quality_of_dermatologic_diagnosis","5563852_Prediction_of_postoperative_morbidity_after_lung_resection_using_an_artificial_neural_network_ensemble","4341671_A_web-accessible_framework_for_the_automated_storage_and_texture_analysis_of_biomedical_images","4247535_Feature_Selection_for_Medical_Data_Mining_Comparisons_of_Expert_Judgment_and_Automatic_Approaches","3753739_An_unsupervised_neural_network_approach_to_medical_data_mining_techniques","2592502_A_Comparison_of_Linear_Genetic_Programming_and_Neural_Networks_in_Medical_Data_Mining"]}
