{"id":"345966880_DeepCOVID_An_Operational_Deep_Learning-driven_Framework_for_Explainable_Real-time_COVID-19_Forecasting","abstract":"How do we forecast an emerging pandemic in real time in a purely data-driven manner? How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DeepCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.","authors":["Alexander Rodriguez","Anika Tabassum","Jiaming Cui","Jiajia Xie"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.1101/2020.09.28.20203109"],"references":["349271970_Evaluating_epidemic_forecasts_in_an_interval_format","339757623_The_effect_of_travel_restrictions_on_the_spread_of_the_2019_novel_coronavirus_COVID-19_outbreak","328639130_DEFSI_Deep_Learning_Based_Epidemic_Forecasting_with_Synthetic_Information","325800258_Nonmechanistic_forecasts_of_seasonal_influenza_with_iterative_one-week-ahead_distributions","321843286_Forecasting_influenza-like_illness_dynamics_for_military_populations_using_neural_networks_and_social_media","349317144_Measuring_movement_and_social_contact_with_smartphone_data_a_real-time_application_to_COVID-19","341415297_Wrong_but_Useful_-_What_Covid-19_Epidemiologic_Models_Can_and_Cannot_Tell_Us","339369121_An_interactive_web-based_dashboard_to_track_COVID-19_in_real_time","334715036_EpiDeep_Exploiting_Embeddings_for_Epidemic_Forecasting","323166006_A_Smartphone-Driven_Thermometer_Application_for_Real-Time_Population-_and_Individual-Level_Influenza_Surveillance"]}
