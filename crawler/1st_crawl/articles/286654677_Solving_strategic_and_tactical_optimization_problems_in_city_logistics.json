An improved managem ent of the traffic related to the freight transport can have a positive impact in many respects : security, congestion of the road network, noise and air pollution, costs. City Logistics studies the dynamic management of urban freight transport in order to deliver distribution systems solutions that may be suitable for both the community and freight carriers. This thesis originates from the ANR Project MODUM, which proposes a freight distribution system based on a ring of Urban Distribution Centers (UDCs) located in the outskirts of a city. In the first part, this system is studied from both a strategic and a tactical point of view. The Multicommodity-Ring Location Routing Problem (MRLRP) considers long-term decisions, i.e. the installation of the UDCs and the ring connection, without disregarding more tactical aspects. The MRLRP has been tackled by three solution methods, which proved effective on a large set of test instances. In the second part of the thesis, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Intermediate Replenishment Facilities (VRPIRF) is studied. The VRPIRF is a more tactical problem that arises in City Logistics each time both the multi-trip and the multi-depot features, i.e. the possibility for a vehicle to be reloaded at one of a set of facilities, are present. Several exact algorithms, namely two of type Branch&Cut and two of type Branch& Price, have been developed for this problem. computational experiments on benchmark instances taken from the literature have been conducted to assess their performance, leading to very promising results.","authors":["Paolo Gianessi"],"meta":["November 2014"],"references":[]}
