{"id":"327416626_ReSyf_a_French_lexicon_with_ranked_synonyms","abstract":"In this article, we present ReSyf, a lexical resource of monolingual synonyms ranked according to their difficulty to be read and understood by native learners of French. The synonyms come fom an existing lexical network and thay have been semantically disambiguated and refined. A ranking algorithm, based on a wide range of linguistic features and validated through an evaluation campaign with human annotators, automatically sorts the synonyms corresponding to a given word sense by reading difficulty. ReSyf is freely available and will be integrated into a web platform for reading assistance. It can also be applied to perform lexical simplification of French texts.","authors":["Mokhtar Boumedyen Billami","Thomas Fran√ßois","Nuria Gala"],"meta":["August 2018","Conference: International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2018)At: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01861652","Project: Reading Aids to leverage Document Accessibility for Children with Dyslexia (ANR project, 2016-2020)"],"references":[]}
