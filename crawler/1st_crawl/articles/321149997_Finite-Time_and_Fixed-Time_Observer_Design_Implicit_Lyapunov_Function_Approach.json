{"id":"321149997_Finite-Time_and_Fixed-Time_Observer_Design_Implicit_Lyapunov_Function_Approach","abstract":"This work deals with the problem of finite-time and fixed-time observation of linear multiple input multiple output (MIMO) control systems. The proposed nonlinear dynamic observers guarantee convergence of the observer states to the original system state in a finite and in a fixed (defined a priori) time. Algorithms for the observers parameters tuning are also provided and a robustness analysis against input disturbances and measurement noises is carried out. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples that consider both noisy and noise-free measurements and a comparison with a high-gain observer is included.","authors":["Francisco Lopez-Ramirez","Andrey Polyakov","Denis Efimov","Wilfrid Perruquetti"],"meta":["January 2018Automatica 87(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.09.007"],"references":["316592710_Fixed-time_observer_with_simple_gains_for_uncertain_systems","299823515_The_Block_Control_Principle_I","292137519_Uniform_Robust_Exact_Differentiator","265442378_Linear_Multivariable_Controll_A_Geometric_Approach","260708574_Nonlinear_Feedback_Design_for_Fixed-Time_Stabilization_of_Linear_Control_Systems","260661794_Observer_Design_for_Nonlinear_Systems_Under_Unknown_Time-Varying_Delays","226551139_Input_to_State_Stability_and_Allied_System_Properties","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","3483437_Observing_the_State_of_a_Linear_System","3033027_Finite-Time_Observers_Application_to_Secure_Communication","3024434_A_continuous-time_observer_which_converges_in_finite_time","316062826_Robust_Exact_Uniformly_Convergent_Arbitrary_Order_Differentiator","313952592_Time-Varying_Parameter_Identification_Algorithms_Finite_and_Fixed-Time_Convergence","312325928_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_observers_design_via_implicit_Lyapunov_function","307714119_Differential_equations_with_discontinuous_right-hand_side","290181870_High-gain_observers_in_nonlinear_feedback_control","284677648_A_general_approach_to_synthesis_problem","277634623_Nonlinear_Observers_Robust_to_Measurement_Disturbances_in_an_ISS_Sense","267928734_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_stabilization_Implicit_Lyapunov_function_approach","267000811_Data_Assimilation_Making_Sense_of_Observations","260661772_A_Nonlinear_High-Gain_Observer_for_Systems_With_Measurement_Noise_in_a_Feedback_Control_Framework","259829288_Fault_Diagnosis_and_Fault-Tolerant_Control_and_Guidance_for_Aerospace_Vehicles","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","256661035_Robust_Exact_Differentiation_via_Sliding_Mode_Technique","250677663_On_Stability_in_Control_Systems","235057542_Nonlinear_Control_Systems","225755362_Pole_Placement_for_Controlling_a_Large_Scale_Power_System","224839919_A_New_Approach_To_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","224773148_A_New_Approach_to_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","222235464_High_gain_observers_with_updated_gain_and_homogeneous_correction_terms","221042406_Finite_time_stabilization_of_a_perturbed_double_integrator_-_Part_II_Applications_to_Bipedal_Locomotion","220259790_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Robust_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems","220159595_Interval_observers_for_linear_time-invariant_systems_with_disturbances","220159133_On_the_performance_of_high-gain_observers_with_gain_adaptation_under_measurement_noise","220157900_Soft_variable-structure_controls_A_survey","30858526_Finite-Time_Stability_of_Continuous_Autonomous_Systems"]}
