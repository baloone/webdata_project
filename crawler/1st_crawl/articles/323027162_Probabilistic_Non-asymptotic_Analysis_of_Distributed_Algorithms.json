{"id":"323027162_Probabilistic_Non-asymptotic_Analysis_of_Distributed_Algorithms","abstract":"We present a new probabilistic analysis of distributed algorithms. Our approach relies on the theory of quasi-stationary distributions (QSD) recently developped by Champagnat and Villemonais. We give properties on the deadlock time and the distribution of the model before deadlock, both for discrete and diffusion models. Our results are non-asymptotic since they apply to any finite values of the involved parameters (time, numbers of resources, number of processors, etc.) and reflect the real behavior of these algorithms, with potential applications to deadlock prevention, which are very important for real world applications in computer science.","authors":["Nicolas Champagnat","Ren√© Schott","Denis Villemonais"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: Quasi-stationary distributions"],"references":["315807337_Lyapunov_criteria_for_uniform_convergence_of_conditional_distributions_of_absorbed_Markov_processes","314654245_Convergence_of_a_non-failable_mean-field_particle_system","313844513_On_time_scales_and_quasi-stationary_distributions_for_multitype_birth-and-death_processes","301837020_Exponential_convergence_to_quasi-stationary_distribution_for_multi-dimensional_diffusion_processes","262937234_Sharp_asymptotics_for_the_quasi-stationary_distribution_of_birth-and-death_processes","261404786_Exponential_convergence_to_quasi-stationary_distribution_and_Q_Q_-process","305979088_On_quasi-stationary_distributions_in_absorbing_continuous-time_finite_Markov_chains","267433994_Mean_Field_Simulation_for_Monte_Carlo_Integration","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","227790613_Probabilistic_analysis_of_some_distributed_algorithms"]}
