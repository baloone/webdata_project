{"id":"51891283_Expander_Graphs_in_Pure_and_Applied_Mathematics","abstract":"Expander graphs are highly connected sparse finite graphs. They play an\nimportant role in computer science as basic building blocks for network\nconstructions, error correcting codes, algorithms and more. In recent years\nthey have started to play an increasing role also in pure mathematics: number\ntheory, group theory, geometry and more. This expository article describes\ntheir constructions and various applications in pure and applied mathematics.","authors":["Alexander Lubotzky"],"meta":["May 2011Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 49(1)","DOI:10.1090/S0273-0979-2011-01359-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["277916071_An_application_of_Ramanujan_graphs_to_C-algebra_tensor_products_II","268888026_Finite_representations_in_the_unitary_dual_and_Ramanujan_groups","323409508_Sur_certaines_hypotheses_concernant_les_nombres_premiers","313167315_Cayley_graphs_Eigenvalues_expanders_and_random_walks_Surveys_in_combinatorics_1995_Stirling","298925961_BOUNDED_GENERATION_AND_KAZHDAN'S_PROPERTY_T","293531364_Prym_Representations_of_Mapping_Class_Groups_In_memory_of_Nicolaas_H_Kuiper_1920-1994","285353703_On_the_representation_of_a_large_even_integer_as_the_sum_of_a_prime_and_the_product_of_at_most_two_primes_II","269000463_Functoriality_for_the_exterior_square_of_GL_4_and_the_symmetric_fourth_of_GL_2_Appendix_1_by_Dinakar_Ramakrishnan_Appendix_2_by_Henry_H_Kim_and_Peter_Sarnak","268891811_What_is_Property_t","268887069_Expander_graphs_random_matrices_and_quantum_chaos"]}
