{"id":"324478329_Spoken_Indian_language_identification_a_review_of_features_and_databases","abstract":"Spoken language is one of the distinctive characteristics of the human race. Spoken language processing is a branch of computer science that plays an important role in humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI), which has made remarkable advancement in the last two decades. This paper reviews and summarizes the acoustic, phonetic and prosody features that have been used for spoken language identification specifically for Indian languages. In addition, we also review the speech databases, which are already available for Indian languages and can be used for the purposes of spoken language identification.","authors":["Aarti Bakshi","Sunil Kumar Kopparapu"],"meta":["April 2018Sadhana 43(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12046-018-0841-y"],"references":["348215059_Change_in_Progress_Phonology_of_Marathi-Hindi_contact_in_astern_Vidarbha","307466234_Phonetic_implementation_of_geminates_in_Malayalam_nouns","303540711_Phonation_types_in_Marathi_An_acoustic_investigation","273745547_Development_of_Application_Specific_Continuous_Speech_Recognition_System_in_Hindi","321500481_The_Theory_of_Lexical_Phonology","310762062_A_Study_on_Detection_of_Intonation_Events_of_Assamese_Speech_Required_for_Tilt_Model","303475617_Malayalam_Phonology_Segmentals","302069754_Weight-sensitive_stress_and_acoustic_correlates_of_disyllabic_words_in_Marathi","268339601_Hindi-Urdu_stress-accent_or_non-stress_accent","267938540_Malayalam_a_Grammatical_Sketch_and_a_Text","267409344_GARHWALI_SPEECH_DATABASE","263441607_Development_of_Assamese_Phonetic_Engine_Some_issues","261268816_Creation_of_Marathi_speech_corpus_for_automatic_speech_recognition","261497676_Development_of_speech_corpora_in_Gujarati_and_Marathi_for_phonetic_transcription","261310992_Analysis_of_breathy_voice_based_on_excitation_characteristics_of_speech_production"]}
