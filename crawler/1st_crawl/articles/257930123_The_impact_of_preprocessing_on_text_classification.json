{"id":"257930123_The_impact_of_preprocessing_on_text_classification","abstract":"Preprocessing is one of the key components in a typical text classification framework. This paper aims to extensively examine the impact of preprocessing on text classification in terms of various aspects such as classification accuracy, text domain, text language, and dimension reduction. For this purpose, all possible combinations of widely used preprocessing tasks are comparatively evaluated on two different domains, namely e-mail and news, and in two different languages, namely Turkish and English. In this way, contribution of the preprocessing tasks to classification success at various feature dimensions, possible interactions among these tasks, and also dependency of these tasks to the respective languages and domains are comprehensively assessed. Experimental analysis on benchmark datasets reveals that choosing appropriate combinations of preprocessing tasks, rather than enabling or disabling them all, may provide significant improvement on classification accuracy depending on the domain and language studied on.","authors":["Alper Kürşat Uysal","Serkan Gunal"],"meta":["January 2014Information Processing and Management 50(1):104 - 112","DOI:10.1016/j.ipm.2013.08.006"],"references":["257015929_A_lexicon_model_for_deep_sentiment_analysis_and_opinion_mining_applications","250030718_Influence_of_Word_Normalization_on_Text_Classification","248591742_An_extensive_empirical_study_of_feature_selection_metrics_for_text_classification_J","221650814_Spam_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_-_Which_Naive_Bayes","221382983_The_Impact_of_Pre-processing_on_the_Classification_of_MEDLINE_Documents","220346182_Author_gender_identification_from_text","220320056_Forman_G_An_Extensive_Empirical_Study_of_Feature_Selection_Metrics_for_Text_Classification_Journal_of_Machine_Learning_Research_3_1289-1305","313607616_Turkish_anti-spam_filtering_using_binary_and_probabilistic_models","292059567_Pattern_Recognition","257404235_Automated_text_classification_using_a_dynamic_artificial_neural_network_model","252016006_Analysis_of_preprocessing_methods_on_classification_of_Turkish_texts","251574648_A_Bayesian_feature_selection_paradigm_for_text_classification","242637644_An_Algorithm_for_Suffix_Stripping","241185375_Developing_a_text_categorization_template_for_Turkish_news_portals","233835285_A_novel_framework_for_SMS_spam_filtering","233835272_On_Feature_Extraction_for_Spam_E-Mail_Detection","233835179_Subspace_based_feature_selection_for_pattern_recognition","230776006_A_novel_probabilistic_feature_selection_method_for_text_classification","228659183_The_Influence_of_Preprocessing_Parameters_on_Text_Categorization","227673604_Information_retrieval_on_Turkish_texts","225237261_A_comparative_study_on_text_representation_schemes_in_text_categorization","222690200_Feature_selection_with_dynamic_mutual_information","222654207_A_Noval_Feature_Selection_Algorithm_for_text_catogorization","220644742_A_comparison_study_on_multiple_binary-class_SVM_methods_for_unilabel_text_categorization","220433523_Feature_Reduction_Techniques_for_Arabic_Text_Categorization","220231025_Information_gain_and_divergence-based_feature_selection_for_machine_learning-based_text_categorization","220220306_Adapting_centroid_classifier_for_document_categorization","220218113_Using_chi-square_statistics_to_measure_similarities_for_text_categorization","220216327_A_Web_page_classification_system_based_on_a_genetic_algorithm_using_tagged-terms_as_features","220017707_An_algoritm_for_suffix_stripping","200773081_A_Vector_Space_Model_for_Automatic_Indexing","200033852_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository_Irvine","2454668_A_Comparative_Study_on_Feature_Selection_in_Text_Categorization","2395713_A_Probabilistic_Analysis_of_the_Rocchio_Algorithm_with_TFIDF_for_Text_Categorization"]}
