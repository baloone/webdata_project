We discretize the partial-differential equations into linear equation systems. An iterative scheme of linear systems is used. The ILU preconditioners of linear systems are performed on the different computation nodes of multi-central processing unit (CPU) cores. Firstly, the preconditioner of general tridiagonal matrix equations is tested on supercomputers. Then, the effects of partial-differential equation systems on the speedup of parallel multiprocessors are examined. The numerical results estimate that the parallel efficiency is higher than in other algorithms.","authors":["Yan-Hong Fan","Ling-Hui Wang","You Jia","Xing-Guo Li"],"meta":["November 2019Symmetry 11(12):1461","DOI:10.3390/sym11121461"],"references":["346054288_Parallel_ILU_preconditioners_in_GPU_computation","315498175_A_self-adaptive_arti_cial_bee_colony_algorithm_based_on_global_best_for_global_optimization","314775491_Parallel_Scalable_Unstructured_CPR-Type_Linear_Solver_for_Reservoir_Simulation","307610453_Multilevel_Pattern_Mining_Architecture_for_Automatic_Network_Monitoring_in_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Communication_Networks","303714555_Effective_and_Efficient_Image_Copy_Detection_with_Resistance_to_Arbitrary_Rotation","295192292_A_novel_collaborative_optimization_algorithm_in_solving_complex_optimization_problems","330202560_Coverless_Image_Steganography_Based_on_SIFT_and_BOF","313447833_Cross-Heterogeneous-Database_Age_Estimation_Through_Correlation_Representation_Learning","304816740_GPU-Accelerated_Preconditioned_GMRES_Solver","301316890_Structural_Minimax_Probability_Machine"]}
