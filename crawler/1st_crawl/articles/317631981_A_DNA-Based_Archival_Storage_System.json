{"id":"317631981_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","abstract":"Demand for data storage is growing exponentially, but thecapacity of existing storage media is not keeping up. UsingDNA to archive data is an attractive possibility becauseit is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm<sup>3</sup>(109 GB/mm<sup>3</sup>), and long-lasting, with observed half-life ofover 500 years.This paper presents an architecture for a DNA-basedarchival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store,and leverages common biochemical techniques to providerandom access. We also propose a new encoding schemethat offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability fordensity. We demonstrate feasibility, random access, and robustnessof the proposed encoding with wet lab experimentsinvolving 151 kB of synthesized DNA and a 42 kB randomaccesssubset, and simulation experiments of larger sets calibratedto the wet lab experiments. Finally, we highlight trendsin biotechnology that indicate the impending practicality ofDNA storage for much larger datasets.","authors":["James Bornholt","Randolph Lopez","Douglas Carmean","Luis Ceze"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Micro PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MM.2017.264163456"],"references":[]}
