{"id":"232645969_A_Study_of_Recent_Research_Trends_and_Experimental_Guidelines_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","abstract":"This work investigates and analyzes recent research trends and presents experimental guidelines on MANETs. More than 1,300 MANET related papers in IEEE/ IEE Electronic Library (IEL Online) from 1998 to 2003 were collected and surveyed. The research trends, qualitative analysis and simulation guidelines from fifteen major MANET issues are investigated to assist the user in conducting MANET research. Based on recent six year trends we found that some issues such as routing and power management attracted much attention. We also found that some issues have potential study value, such as IP addressing and fault tolerance. In the qualitative analysis, we found that some factors such as scalability, stability, and reliability attracted much attention in major MANET issues. The essential simulation metrics for various MANET issues are identified and listed for experimental guidelines. The analysis results demonstrate the utilization trends for various MANET simulators.","authors":["C. R. Dow","Pei-Jung Lin","S. C. Chen","J. H.
