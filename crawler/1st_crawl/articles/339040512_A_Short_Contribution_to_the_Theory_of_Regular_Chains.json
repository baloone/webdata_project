{"id":"339040512_A_Short_Contribution_to_the_Theory_of_Regular_Chains","abstract":"This paper contains short contributions to the theory of regular chains which follow a recent JSC paper by the same authors. These contributions apply to both the nondifferential and the differential context. They deal with the computation of normal forms and with the membership problem to ideals defined by regular chains.","authors":["François Boulier","François Lemaire","Marc Moreno Maza","Adrien Poteaux"],"meta":["June 2021Mathematics in Computer Science 15(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11786-020-00477-x"],"references":["221588708_Comprehensive_Triangular_Decomposition","221588698_On_the_Regularity_Property_of_Differential_Polynomials_Modulo_Regular_Differential_Chains","322817896_An_Equivalence_Theorem_For_Regular_Differential_Chains","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","298875755_Notes_on_triangular_sets_and_triangulation-decomposition_algorithms_-_II_Differential_systems","282615455_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","268311510_Elimination_Methods","265876500_Searching_dependency_between_algebraic_equations_An_algorithm_applied_to_automated_reasoning","242525468_Specializations_in_Differential_Algebra","222467774_On_the_Theories_of_Triangular_Sets","41106961_Representation_for_the_radical_of_a_finitely_generated_differential_ideal","220437488_A_Normal_Form_Algorithm_for_Regular_Differential_Chains","220271409_Notes_on_Triangular_Sets_and_Triangulation-Decomposition_Algorithms_I_Polynomial_Systems","220160830_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","200018952_Differential_Algebra"]}
