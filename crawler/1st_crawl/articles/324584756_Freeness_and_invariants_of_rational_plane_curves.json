{"id":"324584756_Freeness_and_invariants_of_rational_plane_curves","abstract":"Given a parameterization $\\phi$ of a rational plane curve C, we study some invariants of C via $\\phi$. We first focus on the characterization of rational cuspidal curves, in particular we establish a relation between the discriminant of the pull-back of a line via $\\phi$, the dual curve of C and its singular points. Then, by analyzing the pull-backs of the global differential forms via $\\phi$, we prove that the (nearly) freeness of a rational curve can be tested by inspecting the Hilbert function of the kernel of a canonical map. As a by product, we also show that the global Tjurina number of a rational curve can be computed directly from one of its parameterization, without relying on the computation of an equation of C.","authors":["Laurent Bus√©","Alexandru Dimca","Gabriel Sticlaru"],"meta":["April 2018Mathematics of Computation 89(323)","DOI:10.1090/mcom/3495","Project: Free and nearly free projective hypersurfaces"],"references":["323276282_On_the_Freeness_of_Rational_Cuspidal_Plane_Curves","321805015_Nearly_free_curves_and_arrangements_a_vector_bundle_point_of_view","320920359_A_remark_on_free_nearly_free_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","318488167_On_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves_and_the_local_cohomology_of_Jacobian_rings","307898201_Singularities_of_plane_rational_curves_via_projections","285458568_On_some_conjectures_about_free_and_nearly_free_divisors","274644782_Free_divisors_and_rational_cuspidal_plane_curves","259915235_Syzygies_and_logarithmic_vector_fields_along_plane_curves","285458942_On_the_exponents_of_free_and_nearly_free_projective_plane_curves","281119805_Freeness_versus_maximal_global_Tjurina_number_for_plane_curves","238343545_The_Enumerative_Theory_of_Singularities","232025280_Application_of_the_theory_of_the_discriminant_to_highly_singular_plane_curves","230568203_Homology_of_Homogeneous_Divisors","228702995_On_polar_Cremona_transformations","236985337_A_family_of_irreducible_free_divisors_in_P2"]}
