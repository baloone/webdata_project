Its program and information components are characterized. The virtualization as the technological ground of transforming from traditional electronic educational resources to cloud ones is reviewed. Such levels of virtualization are described: data storage device virtualization (Data as Service), hardware virtualization (Hardware as Service), computer virtualization (Infrastructure as Service), software system virtualization (Platform as Service), «desktop» virtualization (Desktop as Service), software user interface virtualization (Software as Service). Possibilities of designing the cloud educational resources system for physics learning researches support taking into account standards of learning objects metadata (accessing via OAI-PMH protocol) and standards of learning tools interoperability (LTI) are shown. The example of integration cloud educational resources into Moodle learning management system with use of OAI-PMH and LTI is given.","authors":["Oleksandr V.
