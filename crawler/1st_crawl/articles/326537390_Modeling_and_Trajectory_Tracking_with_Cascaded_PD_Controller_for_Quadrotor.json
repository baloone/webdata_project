{"id":"326537390_Modeling_and_Trajectory_Tracking_with_Cascaded_PD_Controller_for_Quadrotor","abstract":"In this paper, a nonlinear model of the quadcopter is developed using Newton-Euler formulations of motion and forces along with the design parameters. A cascaded robust PD controller is designed to track the given trajectory. The controller is designed in such a way that even if there are any disturbances, the system behaves well for the given set of inputs and the design parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is being tested in simulation for the Quadcopter model; the results demonstrate improved tracking performance with least settling time and overshoot compared to the results presented in the\nliterature","authors":["Subhechha Subudhi","Ezhilarasi Deenadayalan"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Computer Science 133:952-959","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.082","Conference: Procedia Computer ScienceVolume: 133"],"references":["321450669_Dynamics_and_control_of_quadcopter_using_linear_model_predictive_control_approach","276499059_A_Review_of_Control_Algorithms_for_Autonomous_Quadrotors","271285250_Attitude_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_with_Optimized_PID_Controller","225467146_Feedback_linearization_vs_adaptive_sliding_mode_control_for_a_quadrotor_helicopter_International_Journal_of_Control_Automation_and_Systems_73_419-428","312572114_Dynamics_modelling_and_linear_control_of_quadcopter","308810343_Dynamic_modeling_for_high-performance_controller_design_of_a_UAV_quadrotor","306114306_Quadrotor_helicopter_Attitude_Control_using_cascade_PID","288887473_Inner-Outer_Loop_Control_for_Quadrotor_UAVs_With_Input_and_State_Constraints","278074585_Quadrotor-tracking_controller_design_using_adaptive_dynamic_feedback-linearization_method","232639692_Modelling_and_PID_controller_design_for_a_quadrotor_unmanned_air_vehicle"]}
