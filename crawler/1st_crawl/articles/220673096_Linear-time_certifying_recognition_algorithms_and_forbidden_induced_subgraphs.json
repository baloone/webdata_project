{"id":"220673096_Linear-time_certifying_recognition_algorithms_and_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","abstract":"We give the first linear-time certifying algorithms to recognize split graphs, threshold graphs, chain graphs, co-chain graphs and trivially perfect graphs, with sublinear certificates for negative output. In case of membership in a given graph class our algorithms provide as certificate a structure for the input graph that characterizes the class, and in case of non-membership they provide as certificate a forbidden induced subgraph of the class. The certificates of membership can be authenticated in time O(n + m) and the certificates of non-membership can be authenticated in time O(1).","authors":["Pinar Heggernes","Dieter Kratsch"],"meta":["January 2007","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","263693824_Linear_time_algorithms_for_graph_search_and_connectivity_determination_on_complement_graphs","256416881_Complement_reducible_graphs","248087310_Threshold_Graphs_and_Related_Topics","247813028_The_Comparability_Graph_of_a_Tree","244968939_A_Note_on_The_Comparability_Graph_of_a_Tree","230596014_Theorie_der_Endlichen_und_Unendlichen_Graphen","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","225627867_Certifying_Algorithms_for_Recognizing_Proper_Circular-Arc_Graphs_and_Unit_Circular-Arc_Graphs","225573236_The_LEDA_Platform_for_Combinatorial_and_Geometric_Computing","223152842_Certifying_algorithms_for_recognizing_proper_circular-arc_graphs_and_unit_circular-arc_graphs","223118414_Trivially_perfect_graphs","222624264_Linear_time_algorithms_for_graph_search_and_connectivity_determination_on_complement_graphs","222531309_A_Simple_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Cograph_Recognition","222478520_Fixed-parameter_tractability_of_graph_modification_problems_for_hereditary_properties_1"]}
