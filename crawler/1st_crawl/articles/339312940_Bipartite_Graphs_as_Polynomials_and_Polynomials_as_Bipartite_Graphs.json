{"id":"339312940_Bipartite_Graphs_as_Polynomials_and_Polynomials_as_Bipartite_Graphs","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to show that any finite undirected bipartite graph can be considered as a polynomial P∈ℕ[x], and any directed finite bipartite graph can be considered as a polynomial P∈ℕ[x,y], and vise verse. We also show that the multiplication in the semirings ℕ[x], ℕ[x,y] corresponds to an operation of the corresponding graphs. This operation is exactly the product of Petri nets in the sense of Winskel [G. Winskel and M. Nielsen, Models of concurrency, in Handbook of Logic in Computer Science, Vol. 4, eds. Abamsky, Gabbay and Maibaum (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 1–148]. As an application, we give an approach to dividing in the semirings ℕ[x], ℕ[x,y], and a criteria for parallalization of Petri nets. Finally, we endow the set of all bipartite graphs with the Zariski topology.","authors":["Andrey Grinblat","Viktor Lopatkin"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Algebra and Its Applications 20(05)","DOI:10.1142/S0219498821500833"],"references":["303436310_Chromatic_Polynomials_and_Chromaticity_of_Graphs","235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","225522247_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","222277462_Petri_nets_algebras_morphisms_and_compositionality","220780344_Interlace_polynomial_A_new_graph_polynomial","220532665_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","267653938_Bipartite_Graphs_and_their_Applications_Hardback","267515536_A_note_on_the_values_of_independence_polynomials_at_-1","222396368_The_interlace_polynomial_of_a_graph","220296175_Two_remarks_on_the_adjoint_polynomial","2244559_The_Interlace_Polynomial_A_New_Graph_Polynomial"]}
