{"id":"298407140_Catching_the_Drunk_Robber_on_a_Graph","abstract":"We show that the expected time for a smart \"cop\" to catch a drunk \"robber\" on an n-vertex graph is at most n+o(n). More precisely, let G be a simple, connected, undirected graph with distinguished points u and v among its n vertices. A cop begins at u and a robber at v; they move alternately from vertex to adjacent vertex. The robber moves randomly, according to a simple random walk on G; the cop sees all and moves as she wishes, with the object of \"capturing\" the robber that is, occupying the same vertex-in least expected time. We show that the cop succeeds in expected time no more than n+o(n). Since there are graphs in which capture time is at least n-o(n), this is roughly best possible. We note also that no function of the diameter can be a bound on capture time.","authors":["Natasha Komarov","Peter Winkler"],"meta":["August 2014The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 21(3)"],"references":["225555273_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Carne's_Bound","285216010_Finite_projective_geometries","265422381_On_the_Cop_Number_of_a_Graph","240110427_Maximum_diameter_of_regular_digraphs","226730771_Sur_les_fonctions_convexes_et_les_inegualites_entre_les_valeurs_Moyennes","223146727_Vertex-to-vertex_Pursuit_in_a_Graph","221995121_Gibbs_Measures_and_Dismantlable_Graphs","220532828_Collisions_Among_Random_Walks_on_a_Graph","220192367_A_note_on_-cop_-robber_games_on_graphs","220185375_On_cop-win_graphs","220185303_The_capture_time_of_a_graph","38368034_On_Cumulative_Sums_of_Random_Variables"]}
