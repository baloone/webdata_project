{"id":"257674346_Distributed_Hash_table-based_routing_and_data_management_in_wireless_sensor_networks_A_survey","abstract":"Recent advances in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have led to a great breakthrough in sensors design and features. These technological novelties have brought additional challenges to WSN. Sensornets are seeking for new approaches for efficient data routing and management. The last few years have witnessed the emergence of several approaches that build Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) over WSN. DHTs are initially conceived for efficient data lookup in large-scale wired networks. The main objective of this combination is to manage location-independent data and nodes identification. DHT mapping over WSN brings however new challenges. This paper presents an analytical survey on applying DHT techniques in WSNs. It describes existing DHT-based routing and data management protocols and includes a detailed classification of them.","authors":["Ghofrane Fersi","Wassef Louati","Maher Ben Jemaa"],"meta":["February 2013Wireless Networks 19(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11276-012-0461-0"],"references":["229039240_Enabling_Inter-Domain_Routing_in_Virtual_Coordinate_Based_Ad_Hoc_and_Sensor_Networks","228943905_A_case_for_peer-to-peer_network_overlays_in_sensor_networks","226078072_Peer-to-Peer_Overlay_in_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Networks","222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","221611438_Ad-hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_Routing","221422428_Q-NiGHT_Adding_QoS_to_Data_Centric_Storage_in_Non-Uniform_Sensor_Networks","221234163_Virtual_Ring_Routing_Trends","221164420_Virtual_ring_routing_Network_routing_inspired_by_DHTs","221164091_Chord_A_scalable_peer-to-peer_lookup_service_for_internet_applications","220978596_7_Distributed_Hash_Tables","220951735_APTEEN_A_Hybrid_Protocol_for_Efficient_Routing_and_Comprehensive_Information_Retrieval_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220948730_TEEN_ARouting_Protocol_for_Enhanced_Efficiency_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220926448_GHT_a_geographic_hash_table_for_data-centric_storage","220926359_Rumor_Routing_Algorithm_for_Sensor_Netowrks","220926111_Next_Century_Challenges_Scalable_Coordination_in_Sensor_Networks","220884308_Building_an_efficient_P2P_overlay_for_energy-level_queries_in_sensor_networks","220747373_Virtual_Cord_Protocol_VCP_A_flexible_DHT-like_routing_service_for_sensor_networks","220706432_WSN_and_P2P_A_self-managing_marriage","220465880_Exploiting_Virtual_Coordinates_for_Improved_Routing_Performance_in_Sensor_Networks","321620507_Peer-to-Peer_Systems_and_Applications","321619778_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_Applications","306204254_Wireless_sensor_networks_Smart_Environments_Technologies","288180715_Application_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_to_Healthcare_Promotion","285854667_Teen_Arouting_protocol_for_enhanced_efficiency_in_wireless_sensor_networks","285480574_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","269653904_Event_Driven_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network-_A_Survey","269034336_Directed_Diffusion","261355675_APTEEN_a_hybrid_protocol_for_efficient_routing_and_comprehensive_information_retrieval_in_wireless","251696291_Wireless_sensor_and_actor_We_refer_to_entities_that_can_act_on_the_network_as_actors_They_are_sometimes_referred_to_as_actuators_in_related_literature_networks_research_challenges","247301508_Abstract_Pushing_Chord_into_the_Underlay_Scalable_Routing_for_Hybrid_MANETs","243767766_Chapter_Ad_hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_Routing","238808228_Wireless_sensor_and_actor_networks_research_challenges1","229593478_Porting_AODV-UU_Implementation_to_ns-2_and_Enabling_Trace-based_Simulation","228849137_Energy-aware_Virtual_Ring_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","228642668_Performance_evaluation_of_chord_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","228526810_Path_Heuristics_using_ACO_for_Inter-Domain_Routing_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_and_Sensor_Networks","228057919_Various_techniques_used_in_connection_with_random_digits","224395120_Advantages_of_virtual_addressing_for_efficient_and_failure_tolerant_routing_in_sensor_networks","224344417_Virtual_Cord_Protocol_VCP_A_flexible_DHT-like_routing_service_for_sensor_networks","224198266_Exploiting_Virtual_Coordinates_for_Improved_Routing_Performance_in_Sensor_Networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","221477940_Using_asymmetric_links_to_improve_SSR's_routing_performance","221461142_Pastry_Scalable_Decentralized_Object_Location_and_Routing_for_Large-Scale_Peer-to-Peer_Systems","221091371_The_Tenet_architecture_for_tiered_sensor_networks","220978655_8_Selected_DHT_Algorithms","220948457_Using_Linearization_for_Global_Consistency_in_SSR","220761452_Using_link-layer_broadcast_to_improve_scalable_source_routing","220639429_NBDT_An_efficient_P2P_indexing_scheme_for_web_service_discovery","220452102_Review_-_Adaptive_Protocols_for_Information_Dissemination_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220442985_The_Tenet_Architecture_for_Tiered_Sensor_Networks","27367037_A_Survey_of_Application_Distribution_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","4373246_Performance_Evaluation_of_Structured_P2P_over_Wireless_Multi-hop_Networks","36450314_Self-stabilizing_ring_networks_on_connected_graphs","4373303_A_Case_for_an_Overlay_Routing_on_Top_of_MAC_Layer_for_WSN"]}
