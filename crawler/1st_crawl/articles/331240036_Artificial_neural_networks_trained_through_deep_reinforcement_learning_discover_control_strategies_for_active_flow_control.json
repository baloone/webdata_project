It is shown that, in a two-dimensional simulation of the Kármán vortex street at moderate Reynolds number ( $Re=100$ ), our artificial neural network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8 %. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5 % of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found. This opens the way to a new class of methods for performing active flow control.","authors":["Jean Rabault","Miroslav Kuchta","Atle Jensen","Ulysse Reglade"],"meta":["April 2019Journal of Fluid Mechanics 865:281-302","DOI:10.1017/jfm.2019.62"],"references":["323026949_Efficient_collective_swimming_by_harnessing_vortices_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","319630822_Performing_particle_image_velocimetry_using_artificial_neural_networks_A_proof-of-concept","318430079_Model_identification_of_reduced_order_fluid_dynamics_systems_using_deep_learning","307930906_Drag_reduction_of_a_car_model_by_linear_genetic_programming_control","306049229_Visualizing_the_Hidden_Activity_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769991_Trust_Region_Policy_Optimization","313231782_Deep_learning_in_fluid_dynamics","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309727616_Machine_Learning_Control_-_Taming_Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Turbulence"]}
