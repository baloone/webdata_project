{"id":"267118543_Sandwiched_Renyi_divergence_satisfies_data_processing_inequality","abstract":"Sandwiched (quantum) α-Rényi divergence has been recently defined in the independent works of M.M. Wilde et al. [“Strong converse for the classical capacity of entanglement-breaking channels”, preprint http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1586 (2013)] and M. Müller-Lennert et al. [ibid. 54, No. 12, 122203, 20 p. (2013; Zbl 1290.81016)]. This new quantum divergence has already found applications in quantum information theory. Here we further investigate properties of this new quantum divergence. In particular, we show that sandwiched α-Rényi divergence satisfies the data processing inequality for all values of α>1. Moreover we prove that α-Holevo information, a variant of Holevo information defined in terms of sandwiched α-Rényi divergence, is super-additive. Our results are based on Hölder’s inequality, the Riesz-Thorin theorem and ideas from the theory of complex interpolation. We also employ Sion’s minimax theorem. ©2013 American Institute of Physics","authors":["Salman Beigi"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of Mathematical Physics 54(12)","DOI:10.1063/1.4838855"],"references":["248382175_Impossibility_of_Local_State_Transformation_via_Hypercontractivity","279357250_Interpolation_of_Lp-Spaces","267168963_Positive_Definite_Matrices","267137527_Interpolation_Theory","265423772_Non-commutative_L_p_-spaces","264955351_Interpolation_Spaces_An_Introduction","251471517_Chapter_34_Non-commutative_l_p-spaces","251172694_Interpolation_Spaces","248390410_Methods_of_modern_mathematical_physics_II_Fourier_analysis_self-_adjointness","241278754_Monotonicity_of_a_relative_R'enyi_entropy","235893712_Fundamental_Bound_on_the_Reliability_of_Quantum_Information_Transmission","241180021_Arimoto_channel_coding_converse_and_Renyi_divergence","240115570_Methods_of_modern_mathematical_physics_Academic_Press","237197932_On_quantum_Renyi_entropies_A_new_generalization_and_some_properties","235678449_A_note_on_the_p-q_norms_of_2-positive_maps"]}
