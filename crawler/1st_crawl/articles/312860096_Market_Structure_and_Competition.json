{"id":"312860096_Market_Structure_and_Competition","abstract":"An important aspect of decision-making by an entrepreneur concerns the environment within which the firm operates. A number of factors influence this external environment, the principal of which is the extent of competition coming from rival producers of the same product or a close substitute for it. Competition may come from rival producers in the domestic market, or from imports from abroad. The distinction between those two sources is not of critical importance in this chapter, although it may be important in other contexts â€” for example, balance-of-payments implications of high imports, quotas and controls on imports which do not apply to the home market, etc.","authors":["Julian Gough","Stephen Hill"],"meta":["January 1979","DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-16225-3_6","In book: Fundamentals of Managerial Economics (pp.75-93)"],"references":["316268388_Modern_Microeconomics","39000055_Modern_Microeconomics"]}
