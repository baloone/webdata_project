{"id":"327355962_Trajectory_Tracking_for_a_Commercial_Quadrotor_via_Time-Varying_Backstepping","abstract":"In this paper we propose a non-linear control law to achieve trajectory tracking in the 3D space for a commercial AR.Drone 2.0 quadrotor. The proposed control law is based on a non-linear time varying version of the Backstepping technique that takes into account the dynamics of the internal orientation controller of the AR.Drone. The stability of the control law is ensured by the design of recursive Lyapunov functions and its performance is tested by numeric simulations on MATLAb Simulink environment.","authors":["M.A. Rosaldo-Serrano","Eduardo Aranda-Bricaire"],"meta":["January 2018IFAC-PapersOnLine 51(13):532-536","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.334"],"references":["312572114_Dynamics_modelling_and_linear_control_of_quadcopter"]}
