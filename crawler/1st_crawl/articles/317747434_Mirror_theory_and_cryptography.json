{"id":"317747434_Mirror_theory_and_cryptography","abstract":"“Mirror Theory” is the theory that evaluates the number of solutions of affine systems of equalities (Formula presented.) and non equalities ((Formula presented.)) in finite groups. It is deeply related to the security and attacks of many generic cryptographic secret key schemes, for example random Feistel schemes (balanced or unbalanced), Misty schemes, Xor of two pseudo-random bijections to generate a pseudo-random function etc. In this paper we will assume that the groups are abelian. Most of time in cryptography the group is (Formula presented.) and we will concentrate this paper on these cases. We will present here general definitions, some theorems, and many examples and computer simulations.","authors":["Jacques Patarin"],"meta":["August 2017Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 28(4):1-18","DOI:10.1007/s00200-017-0326-y"],"references":["321319634_A_combinatorial_problem_on_abelian_groups","265374124_A_problem_in_combinatorial_group_theory","221462195_A_Proof_of_Security_in_O2","221355110_Security_of_Random_Feistel_Schemes_with_5_or_More_Rounds","221274785_The_Coefficients_H_Technique","220990610_A_Proof_of_Security_in_O2_n_for_the_Xor_of_Two_Random_Permutations","220833837_On_Linear_Systems_of_Equations_with_Distinct_Variables_and_Small_Block_Size","220335347_Security_of_balanced_and_unbalanced_Feistel_Schemes_with_Linear_Non_Equalities","220334214_Introduction_to_Mirror_Theory_Analysis_of_Systems_of_Linear_Equalities_and_Linear_Non_Equalities_for_Cryptography"]}
