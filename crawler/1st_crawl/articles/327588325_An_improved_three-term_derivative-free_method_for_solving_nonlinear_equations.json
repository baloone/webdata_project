{"id":"327588325_An_improved_three-term_derivative-free_method_for_solving_nonlinear_equations","abstract":"In this work, we proposed an improved three-term derivative-free method for solving system of nonlinear equations, which combines the ideas in Yan et al. (J Comput Appl Math 234:649–657, 2010) and Yuan and Zhang (J Comput Appl Math 286:186–195, 2015) with the projection method. The global convergence of the proposed method was established under some conditions. Numerical experiment shows that the method is efficient and promising compared to some existing ones. © 2018, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.","authors":["Auwal Bala Abubakar","Poom Kumam"],"meta":["September 2018Computational and Applied Mathematics 37(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40314-018-0712-5","Project: Nonlinear Monotone operator equations"],"references":["325105957_A_descent_Dai-Liao_conjugate_gradient_method_for_nonlinear_equations","319989578_A_family_of_conjugate_gradient_methods_for_large-scale_nonlinear_equations","317932625_A_positive_spectral_gradient-like_method_for_large-scale_nonlinear_monotone_equations","291390290_A_matrix-free_approach_for_solving_systems_of_nonlinear_equations","283259878_Two_New_PRP_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithms_for_Minimization_Optimization_Models","282544559_A_Modified_Hestenes_and_Stiefel_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Nonsmooth_Minimizations_and_Nonlinear_Equations","281233234_A_Globally_Convergent_Inexact_Newton_Method_for_Systems_of_Monotone_Equations","313592104_Global_convergence_of_BFGS_and_PRP_methods_under_a_modified_weak_Wolfe-Powell_line_search","311909370_A_Class_of_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Simultaneous_Equations","293220732_Equivalence_between_iterative_method_and_nonlinear_complementary_method_for_two_dimensional_contact_problem_with_friction"]}
