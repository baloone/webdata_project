{"id":"320882305_Teaching_with_physical_computing_devices_the_BBC_microbit_initiative","abstract":"There is a growing interest in small programmable devices that can be used in schools and in extra-curricular contexts to teach computer science. The BBC micro:bit is one such device; through a collaborative venture, micro:bits were recently distributed to every 11-12 year old in the UK. Although the technology itself is often of primary interest, a focus on how teachers can use the technology in the classroom to help students learn is increasingly being drawn out in the literature: this paper adds to that body of work Having interviewed 15 teachers and 54 students about their use and experience of the micro:bit, we present an analysis of the varied ways in which teachers are using the BBC micro:bit, and note a range of instructional styles. We classify different approaches to teaching with physical computing, identifying teachers who we describe as either inspirers, providers or consumers. Finally we make recommendations for more teacher professional learning opportunities around physical computing. The results of this qualitative study will be useful to teachers and teacher educators wishing to work more effectively with physical computing in the classroom.","authors":["Sue Sentance","Jane Waite","Lucy Yeomans","Emily MacLeod"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3137065.3137083","Conference: the 12th Workshop","Projects: Microbit reserachBBC micro:bit evaluation"],"references":["316947289_Creating_Cool_Stuff_Pupils'_Experience_of_the_BBC_microbit","316939924_Towards_Supporting_Scientific_Inquiry_in_Computer_Science_Education","301429315_The_network_of_teaching_excellence_in_computer_science_and_master_teachers","299135706_Designing_a_Blended_Middle_School_Computer_Science_Course_for_Deeper_Learning_A_Design-Based_Research_Approach","296846945_Differentiating_for_Diversity_Using_Universal_Design_for_Learning_in_Computer_Science_Education","284773069_The_Influence_of_Computer_and_Internet_Use_on_Teachers'_Pedagogical_Practices_and_Perceptions","262201733_Gears_of_our_Childhood_Constructionist_toolkits_robotics_and_physical_computing_past_and_future","261960783_A_Crafts-Oriented_Approach_to_Computing_in_High_School_Introducing_Computational_Concepts_Practices_and_Perspectives_with_Electronic_Textiles","255566914_Implementing_Computer_Technologies_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Practices","234810765_Computational_thinking_for_youth_in_practice","227041792_Cognitive_Load_Theory_and_Complex_Learning_Recent_Developments_and_Future_Directions","220612700_Developing_a_computer_science-specific_learning_taxonomy","215666096_Qualitative_Content_Analysis","318494168_Epistemological_Pluralism_Styles_and_Voices_within_the_Computer_Culture","308007075_Teaching_Elementary_Students_Programming_in_a_Physical_Computing_Classroom","306296469_Epistemological_Pluralism_Styles_and_Voices_Within_the_Computer_Culture","305726779_BitBlox_A_Redesign_of_the_Breadboard","303296565_Microsoft_touch_develop_and_the_BBC_microbit","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch","298769251_Students'_Attitudes_and_Motivation_During_Robotics_Activities","286873961_The_TangibleK_robotics_program_Applied_computational_thinking_for_young_children","282605828_My_Interactive_Garden_-_A_Constructionist_Approach_to_Creative_Learning_with_Interactive_Installations_in_Computing_Education","282605767_Key_Competences_with_Physical_Computing","269746769_The_Savage_Mind","266653987_Challenge_and_creativity_Using_NET_gadgeteer_in_schools","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools","264345477_Watching_creating_and_achieving_Creative_technologies_as_a_conduit_for_learning_in_the_early_years","259514433_Computational_thinking_and_tinkering_Exploration_of_an_early_childhood_robotics_curriculum","234814110_Teaching_programming_using_bricolage","234672868_Epistemological_Pluralism_Styles_and_Voices_within_the_Computer_Culture","2393019_Constructivism_in_Computer_Science_Education"]}
