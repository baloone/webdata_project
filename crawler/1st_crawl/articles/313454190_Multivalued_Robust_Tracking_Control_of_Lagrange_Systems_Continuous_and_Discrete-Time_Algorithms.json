{"id":"313454190_Multivalued_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_Lagrange_Systems_Continuous_and_Discrete-Time_Algorithms","abstract":"The robust trajectory tracking of fully actuated Lagrange systems is studied. Exogenous perturbations as well as parameter uncertainties are taken into account. A family of set-valued passivity-based controllers is proposed, including firstorder sliding-mode schemes. The existence of solutions and the stability of the closed-loop system are established in continuoustime. An implicit discretization approach is proposed and the well posedness and the stability of the closed-loop system are studied. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed discrete-time controller.","authors":["Felix Alfredo Miranda Villatoro","Bernard Brogliato","Fernando Castanos"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 62(9):4436 - 4450","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2662804"],"references":["304363950_Implicit_discrete-time_twisting_controller_without_numerical_chattering_Analysis_and_experimental_results","299375056_Robust_Output_Regulation_of_Strongly_Passive_Linear_Systems_With_Multivalued_Maximally_Monotone_Controls","286136987_Experimental_results_on_implicit_and_explicit_time-discretization_of_equivalent-control-based_sliding-mode_control","325423580_Tracking_control_of_non-linear_systems_using_sliding_surfaces_with_application_to_robot_manipulators","321620160_Convex_Functional_Analysis","321524747_Dissipative_Systems_Analysis_and_Control","319477781_Experimental_Comparisons_Between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Implementations_of_Discrete-Time_Sliding_Mode_Controllers_Toward_Input_and_Output_Chattering_Suppression","313643693_Adaptive_motion_control_of_rigid_robots_A_tutorial","301436522_On_Output_Regulation_in_State-Constrained_Systems_An_Application_to_Polyhedral_Case","296628386_Implicit_Euler_Time-Discretization_of_a_Class_of_Lagrangian_Systems_with_Set-Valued_Robust_Controller"]}
