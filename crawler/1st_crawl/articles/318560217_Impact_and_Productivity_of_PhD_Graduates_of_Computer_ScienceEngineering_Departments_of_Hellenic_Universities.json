{"id":"318560217_Impact_and_Productivity_of_PhD_Graduates_of_Computer_ScienceEngineering_Departments_of_Hellenic_Universities","abstract":"This article presents an anatomy of PhD programmes in Hellenic universities' departments of computer science/engineering from the perspective of research productivity and impact. The study aims at showing the dynamics of research conducted in computer science/engineering departments, and after recognizing weaknesses, to motivate the stakeholders to take actions that will improve competition and excellence. Beneficiaries of this investigation are the following entities: a) the departments themselves can assess their performance relative to that of other departments and then set strategic goals and design procedures to achieve them, b) supervisors can assess the part of their research conducted with PhDs and set their own goals, c) former PhDs who can identify their relative success, and finally d) prospective PhD students who can consider the efficacy of departments and supervisors in conducting high-impact research as one more significant factor in designing the doctoral studies they will follow.","authors":["Dimitrios Katsaros","Yannis Manolopoulos"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["314724624_Evaluation_of_50_Greek_Science_and_Engineering_University_Departments_using_Google_Scholar","287208708_The_research_activity_of_the_current_faculty_of_the_Greek_chemical_engineering_departments_a_bibliometric_study_in_national_and_international_context","275527716_Conferences_versus_journals_in_computer_science_Conferences_vs_Journals_in_Computer_Science","332085835_Bibliometrics_and_Research_Evaluation_Uses_and_Abuses","318080973_Suitability_of_Google_Scholar_as_a_source_of_scientific_information_and_as_a_source_of_data_for_scientific_evaluation-Review_of_the_Literature","305912469_Science_Dynamics_and_Research_Production_Indicators_Indexes_Statistical_Laws_and_Mathematical_Models","303345360_Handbook_of_Bibliometric_Indicators_Quantitative_Tools_for_Studying_and_Evaluating_Research","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","282206174_Ranking_Romanian_academic_departments_in_three_fields_of_study_using_the_g_-index","267393561_An_Evaluation_of_the_Greek_Universities'_Economics_Departments"]}
