{"id":"307856236_What's_the_Risk_Assessing_and_Mitigating_Risk_in_Cardiothoracic_Surgery","abstract":"The considerable global burden of surgery, combined with evidence of considerable variability in cardiothoracic surgical outcomes, and its associated costs create a “burning platform” to improve the delivery of health care. An important component of this effort involves a systematic, prioritized approach to risk assessment and management to improve safety, quality, and value in all aspects of surgical care. Each facility, health system, and individual practitioner has unique and important opportunities to learn, improve, and address these risks. Improvements in risk assessment and mitigation are founded on improved data mining, management, analysis, and widespread access by frontline health care professionals. Parallel improvements in technology and communication will enhance multidisciplinary teamwork and accelerate the transformation of networked, decentralized surgical care.","authors":["Kevin W
