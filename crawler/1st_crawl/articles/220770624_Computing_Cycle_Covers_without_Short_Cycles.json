{"id":"220770624_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles","abstract":"A cycle cover of a graph is a spanning subgraph where each node is part of exactly one simple cycle. A k-cycle cover is a cycle cover where each cycle has length at least k. We call the decision problems whether a directed or undirected graph has a k-cycle cover k-DCC and k-UCC. Given a graph with edge weights one and two, Min-k-DCC and Min-k-UCC are the minimization problems of finding a k-cycle cover with minimum weight.\nWe present factor 4/3 approximation algorithms for Min-k-DCC with running time O(n\n5/2) (independent of k). Specifically, we obtain a factor 4/3 approximation algorithm for the asymmetric travelling salesperson problem with distances one and two and a factor 2/3 approximation algorithm for the directed path packing problem with the same running time. On the other hand, we show that k-DCC is \\(\n\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}\n\\)-complete for k ≥ 3 and that Min-k-DCC has no PTAS for k ≥ 4, unless \\(\n\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}\n\\)\nFurthermore, we design a polynomial time factor 7/6 approximation algorithm for Min-k-UCC. As a lower bound, we prove that Min-k-UCC has no PTAS for k = 12, unless \\(\n\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}\n\\).","authors":["Markus Bläser","Bodo Siebert"],"meta":["August 2001","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44676-1_31","SourceDBLP","Conference: Algorithms - ESA 2001, 9th Annual European Symposium, Aarhus, Denmark, August 28-31, 2001, Proceedings"],"references":["220695898_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Complexity","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","256157863_A_matching_problem_with_side_conditions","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","239344419_A_Short_Proof_of_the_Factor_Theorem_for_Finite_Graphs","234108774_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","230596039_Matching_theory","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","226272308_Path_Trees_and_Flowers","226125997_Recursive_construction_for_3-regular_expanders","222470961_Optimization_Approximation_and_Complexity_Classes","221499215_Recursive_Construction_for_3-Regular_Expanders","221316849_The_Square-Free_2-Factor_Problem_in_Bipartite_Graphs","220896936_Approximation_Hardness_of_TSP_with_Bounded_Metrics","220138560_Approximation_Hardness_of_TSP_with_Bounded_Metrics","220114756_An_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Asymmetric_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","220075987_An_extension_of_matching_theory","3593095_Long_tours_and_short_superstrings","2493479_Some_optimal_inapproximability_results"]}
