{"id":"320470924_Paraconsistent_Artificial_Neural_Network_-_RNAP_applied_to_Dynamic_Databases_in_the_Extraction_of_the_Moving_Average","abstract":"The modules composed of logical computational arrangements made with algorithms based on Paraconsistent Annotated Logic with annotation of two values (PAL2v), called Artificial Neural Paraconsistent Cells (ANPCell), have been the subject of several researches on applications in the areas of engineering and computer science. Several works published with the ANPCell show that, since that first appeared in the year 2000, these modules have been widely applied in computer systems related to the area of Artificial Intelligence. In this work, we present a review of the fundamentais of the ANPC, highlighted by the performance ofthe Paraconsistent Artificial Neural learning Cell-leANPCell. Among the components of the ANPCell family the Cell- leANPCell is very important for presenting in its operation some properties that can be compared to the behaviour of a neuron. At the end of this work we present a computational structure that was built with 6 leANPCeIl's to detect the moving average of a dynamic database .","authors":["João Inácio da Silva Filho","Arnaldo Carvalho","Clovis Cruz","Maurício Conceição Mário"],"meta":["March 2017","Projects: Paraconsistent Logic in Automation & RoboticsLink Quality Estimator with PAL\"PAL2v Filter\""],"references":["279884008_Uncertainty_Treatment_using_Paraconsistent_Logic","234812689_Uncertainty_treatment_using_paraconsistent_logic_introducing_paraconsistent_artificial_neural_networks","314310246_Introduction_to_Statistical_Quality_Control","224686628_Annotated_Paraconsistent_Logic_applied_to_an_Expert_System_dedicated_for_supporting_in_an_electric_power_transmission_systems_re-establishment","220689849_Neural_Network_Learning_and_Expert_System","3247924_Statistical_process_control_to_improve_coding_and_code_review"]}
