{"id":"353004471_Entropy-based_dynamic_graph_embedding_for_anomaly_detection_on_multiple_climate_time_series","abstract":"Abnormal climate event is that some meteorological conditions are extreme in a certain time interval. The existing methods for detecting abnormal climate events utilize supervised learning models to learn the abnormal patterns, but they cannot detect the untrained patterns. To overcome this problem, we construct a dynamic graph by discovering the correlation among the climate time series and propose a novel dynamic graph embedding model based on graph entropy called EDynGE to discriminate anomalies. The graph entropy measurement quantifies the information of the graphs and constructs the embedding space. We conducted experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world meteorological datasets. The results showed that EdynGE model achieved a better F1-score than the baselines by 43.2%, and the number of days of abnormal climate events has increased by 304.5 days in the past 30 years.","authors":["Gen Li","Jason J.
