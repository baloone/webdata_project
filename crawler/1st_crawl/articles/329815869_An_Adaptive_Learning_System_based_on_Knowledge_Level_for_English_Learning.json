{"id":"329815869_An_Adaptive_Learning_System_based_on_Knowledge_Level_for_English_Learning","abstract":"Traditional learning approaches in teaching English assume that learners have same background, ability, and requirements. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning systems-knowledge level (ALS-KL) is a learning system that can personalize materials due to proficiency level of English language learners. A pre-test is given to measure the proficiency level of learners. The level is divided into elementary, intermediate and advanced. The ALS-KL provides the most suitable materials according to the needs of the learners. We applied the proposed system on 90 learners with different English proficiency level. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using post-test. The results of the post-test showed that the proposed system was able to improve learners with intermediate-level and advanced level 1.5 times and 4 times respectively while reducing the number of learners with elementary-level by more than 50%. These indicate the effectiveness of the proposed system.","authors":["Sfenrianto Sfenrianto","Yustinus B.
