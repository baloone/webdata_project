{"id":"311668600_TeKnowbase_Towards_Construction_of_a_Knowledge-base_of_Technical_Concepts","abstract":"In this paper, we describe the construction of TeKnowbase, a knowledge-base of technical concepts in computer science. Our main information sources are technical websites such as Webopedia and Techtarget as well as Wikipedia and online textbooks. We divide the knowledge-base construction problem into two parts -- the acquisition of entities and the extraction of relationships among these entities. Our knowledge-base consists of approximately 100,000 triples. We conducted an evaluation on a sample of triples and report an accuracy of a little over 90\\%. We additionally conducted classification experiments on StackOverflow data with features from TeKnowbase and achieved improved classification accuracy.","authors":["Prajna Upadhyay","Tanuma Patra","Ashwini Purkar","Maya Ramanath"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["312634895_Automatic_Entity_Recognition_and_Typing_in_Massive_Text_Corpora","299969711_Automatic_Entity_Recognition_and_Typing_from_Massive_Text_Corpora","259828897_DBpedia_-_A_Large-scale_Multilingual_Knowledge_Base_Extracted_from_Wikipedia","221605724_Toward_an_Architecture_for_Never-Ending_Language_Learning","221520099_Coupled_semi-supervised_learning_for_information_extraction","311488373_Generating_Quiz_Questions_from_Knowledge_Graphs","303793870_DeepDive_Declarative_Knowledge_Base_Construction","276465076_Knowledge_bases_in_the_age_of_big_data_analytics","266660245_Knowledge_vault_A_web-scale_approach_to_probabilistic_knowledge_fusion","221101345_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora"]}
