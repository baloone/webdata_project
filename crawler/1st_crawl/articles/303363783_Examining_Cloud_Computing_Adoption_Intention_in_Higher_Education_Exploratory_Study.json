{"id":"303363783_Examining_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_Intention_in_Higher_Education_Exploratory_Study","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examining the factors that lead to cloud computing adoption in a higher education setting. This cross-sectional empirical research is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework. Data was collected by surveying 96 students from University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania. The factors that affect cloud computing adoption in higher education were identified and tested using LISREL software. The findings suggested that factors identified can be successfully integrated in our conceptual model. Perceived value and usefulness have a strong positive influence on intentions to use cloud computing in higher education, but student’s attitude towards technology had no significant effects on dependent variable. Perceived risk has significant negative effects on students’ intentions to use cloud computing. The findings are expected to enhance the understanding of cloud computing adoption for students and faculty members. The implication of these findings for faculty members and students are discussed.","authors":["Gheorghe Militaru","Anca Alexandra Purcărea","Olivia Doina Negoiţă","Andrei Niculescu"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-32689-4_56","Conference: International Conference on Exploring Services Science"],"references":["276422694_Exploring_users'_attitudes_and_intentions_toward_the_adoption_of_cloud_computing_in_Saudi_Arabia_An_empirical_investigation","267990869_Toward_the_trend_of_cloud_computing","262358994_Success_Factors_for_Deploying_Cloud_Computing","233043760_Nurses'_motivations_for_Web-based_learning_and_the_role_of_Internet_self-efficacy","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","223248568_Consumer_Perceived_Value_The_Development_of_a_Multiple_Item_Scale","220260090_From_the_Vendor's_Perspective_Exploring_the_Value_Proposition_in_Information_Technology_Outsourcing","322738011_Cloud_computing_-_Issues_research_and_implementations","306364966_Cloud_computing_Paradigms_and_technologies","293431811_What_every_CEO_needs_to_know_about_the_cloud","274645440_The_effects_of_IT_capabilities_and_delivery_model_on_cloud_computing_success_and_firm_performance_for_cloud_supported_processes_and_operations","259920989_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_5","247644487_Technology_Acceptance_Model_3_and_a_Research_Agenda_on_Interventions","220437802_Internet_Self-Efficacy_and_the_Psychology_of_the_Digital_Divide","220377037_Mining_significant_factors_affecting_the_adoption_of_SaaS_using_the_rough_set_approach","220285850_Toward_Dynamic_and_Attribute_Based_Publication_Discovery_and_Selection_for_Cloud_Computing","220197084_Cloud_computing_-_The_business_perspective","220196321_Opportunities_and_risks_of_software-as-a-service_Findings_from_a_survey_of_IT_executives","4359604_Cloud_Computing_-_Issues_Research_and_Implementations"]}
