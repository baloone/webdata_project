{"id":"220089331_The_shortest_path_improvement_problems_under_Hamming_distance","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the shortest path improvement problems under Hamming distance (SPIH), where the weights of edges can be modified only within given intervals. Two models are considered: the general SPIH problem and the SPIH problem with a single pair of required vertices. For the first problem, we show that it is strongly NP-hard. For the second problem, we show that even if the network is a chain network, it is still NP-hard.","authors":["Zhang Binwu","Jian zhong Zhang","L.
