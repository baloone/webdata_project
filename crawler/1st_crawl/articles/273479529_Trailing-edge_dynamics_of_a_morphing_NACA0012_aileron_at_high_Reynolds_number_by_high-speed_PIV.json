{"id":"273479529_Trailing-edge_dynamics_of_a_morphing_NACA0012_aileron_at_high_Reynolds_number_by_high-speed_PIV","abstract":"Particle image velocimetry (piv) measurements are made at the trailing edge of a piezoelectric actuated aileron in order to investigate the physical effect on the flow via high-frequency low-amplitude actuation at high Reynolds numbers. The measurements at different actuation frequencies show the modification of the primary frequency components of the flow with the actuation frequency. A statistical analysis reveals the reduction of the Reynolds stress components which increases with the actuation frequency. Proper orthogonal decomposition (pod) analysis shows the modification of the spatial modes illustrating the vortex breakdown in the shear-layer and the reduction of the temporal mode spectral energy depending on the actuation. It has been shown that a specific low amplitude actuation frequency produces a significant reduction of the predominant shear-layer frequency.","authors":["Johannes Scheller","Maxime Chinaud","Jean-Fran√ßois Rouchon","Eric Duhayon"],"meta":["February 2015Journal of Fluids and Structures 55","DOI:10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2014.12.012"],"references":["274706683_Morphing_Winglets_for_Aircraft_Multi-Phase_Improvement","242683601_New_Actuators_for_Aircraft_and_Space_Application","241252469_Valves_Based_on_Amplified_Piezoelectric_Actuators","234151059_The_Proper_Orthogonal_Decomposition_in_the_Analysis_of_Turbulent_Flows","228598588_Preliminary_testing_of_a_Mach-scaled_active_rotor_blade_with_a_trailing_edge_servo-flap","23614531_Aeroservoelastic_and_Structural_Dynamics_Research_on_Smart_Structures_Conducted_at_NASA_Langley_Research_Center","290391684_Activation_d'une_voilure_deformable_par_des_cables_d'AMF_repartis_en_surface","272609010_Hybrid_Electroactive_Wings_Morphing_for_Aeronautic_Applications","268458515_Low_Reynolds_Number_Behavior_of_a_Solid-State_Piezocomposite_Variable-Camber_Wing","261802179_Investigation_of_the_three-dimensional_turbulent_near-wake_structure_past_a_flat_plate_by_tomographic_PIV_at_high_Reynolds_number","261055157_Thermo-mechanical_coupling_in_Nitinol_Application_to_an_electro-morphing_plate","259327378_Aerodynamic_Optimization_of_a_Morphing_Airfoil_Using_Energy_as_an_Objective","252184539_Design_and_testing_of_a_double_X-frame_piezoelectric_actuator","248025649_Atmospheric_Turbulence_and_Wave_Propagation_The_Structure_of_Inhomogeneous_Turbulence","230917059_Design_of_a_High_Efficiency_Large_Stroke_Electromechanical_Actuator","226446610_High_resolution_PIV_measurements_around_a_model_turbine_blade_trailing_edge_film-cooling_breakout","226011586_A_comparison_between_snapshot_POD_analysis_of_PIV_velocity_and_vorticity_data","225117468_A_Novel_SMA-based_Concept_for_Airfoil_Structural_Morphing","37243595_Analyse_physique_et_modelisation_d'ecoulements_incompressibles_instationnaires_turbulents_autour_d'un_cylindre_circulaire_a_grand_nombre_de_Reynolds","4675089_Motion_of_particles_with_inertia_in_a_compressible_free_shear_layer"]}
