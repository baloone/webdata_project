{"id":"251463767_Chapter_11_Network_reliability","abstract":"Network reliability encompasses a range of issues related to the design and analysis of networks which are subject to the random failure of their components. Relatively simple, and yet quite general, network models can represent a variety of applied problem environments. Network classes for which the models are discussed are particularly appropriate include data communications networks, voice communications networks, transportation networks, computer architectures, electrical power networks and command and control systems. The ultimate objective of research in the area of network reliability is to give design engineers procedures to enhance their ability to design networks for which reliability is an important consideration. Ideally, one would like to generate network design models and algorithms which take as input the characteristics of network components as well as network design criteria, and produce as output an \"optimal\" network design.","authors":["J.
