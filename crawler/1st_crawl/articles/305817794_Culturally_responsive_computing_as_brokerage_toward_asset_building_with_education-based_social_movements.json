{"id":"305817794_Culturally_responsive_computing_as_brokerage_toward_asset_building_with_education-based_social_movements","abstract":"Bridging schools and communities has been a goal, if not hurdle, for reformers who aim to improve the education of low-income and underrepresented students from the bottom-up. Strategies to create these connections are often characterized as ‘brokerage’, where individuals or organizations bridge two or more social worlds. This paper details the design and implementation of educational technologies that support the brokering of school–community connections using a ‘culturally responsive computing’ (CRC) framework. Culturally responsive education is often limited to content and learning styles, which misses the opportunities it creates for a brokerage process that also connects to education-based social movements for economic access in underrepresented communities. This paper provides empirical support for the claim that the CRC framework is well suited for both purposes. It allows schools and communities to build assets together, translating the knowledge and skills of underrepresented communities into math and computing education, while illuminating the ways in which technologies can motivate education-based social movement building.","authors":["Michael L Lachney"],"meta":["August 2016Learning Media and Technology 42(4):1-20","DOI:10.1080/17439884.2016.1211679"],"references":["312553162_Design_Agency","305426244_Boys'_Needlework_Understanding_Gendered_and_Indigenous_Perspectives_on_Computing_and_Crafting_with_Electronic_Textiles","303001934_MODELING_IN_ETHNOCOMPUTING_REPLACING_BI-DIRECTIONAL_FLOWS_WITH_RECURSIVE_EMERGENCE","299645479_Software_Design_in_the_Construction_Genre_of_Learning_Technology_Content_Aware_versus_Content_Agnostic","289999725_Blind_Spots_in_Youth_DIY_Programming_Examining_Diversity_in_Creators_Content_and_Comments_within_the_Scratch_Online_Community","280739503_Adinkra_Mathematics_A_Study_of_Ethnocomputing_in_Ghana","279362099_From_Ethnomathematics_to_Ethnocomputing","262893169_Democratizing_computer_science_knowledge_Transforming_the_face_of_computer_science_through_public_high_school_education","262314073_Toward_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_Education","262273595_Ethnocomputing_with_electronic_textiles_Culturally_responsive_open_design_to_broaden_participation_in_computing_in_American_Indian_youth_and_communities","258198650_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_in_Urban_After-School_Contexts_Two_Approaches","254074787_Toward_a_Theory_of_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy","249423501_Culturally_Situated_Design_Tools_Ethnocomputing_from_Field_Site_to_Classroom","247948482_The_Politics_of_Official_Knowledge_Does_a_National_Curriculum_Make_Sense","227994830_Math_in_a_Cultural_Context_Two_Case_Studies_of_a_Successful_Culturally_Based_Math_Project","220094488_Fractal_Simulations_of_African_Design_in_Pre-College_Computing_Education","37692151_Rethinking_Expertise","349861140_Unequal_By_Design_High-Stakes_Testing_and_the_Standardization_of_Inequality","297522900_Educational_Restructuring_Democratic_Education_and_Teachers","287613340_Forbidden_or_forsaken_The_misuse_of_a_forbidden_knowledge_argument_in_research_on_race_DNA_and_disease","287550683_Ideology_and_curriculum_Third_edition","287365829_Distrusting_educational_technology_Critical_questions_for_changing_times","287298170_The_new_political_economy_of_urban_education_Neoliberalism_race_and_the_right_to_the_city","286052107_Radical_Possibilities_Public_Policy_Urban_Education_and_A_New_Social_Movement","284286790_Leistungen_verschiedener_Gruppen_von_Besatzungskindern_in_Hamburg-Wechsler_Intelligenztest_fur_Kinder_HAWIK","283780415_Mapping_time_space_and_the_body_Indigenous_knowledge_and_mathematical_thinking_in_Brazil","282004300_The_Mismeasure_of_Man","281562613_The_Digital_Youth_Network_Cultivating_Digital_Media_Citizenship_in_Urban_Communities","281451983_Building_the_LEGO_Classroom","277937749_Exploring_the_Racial_Divide_in_Education_and_the_Labor_Market_through_Evidence_from_Interracial_Families","274769350_Ideology_and_Curriculum","271625645_Culturally_responsive_computing_a_theory_revisited","270712637_Digital_Engagement_for_Urban_Youth_From_Theory_to_Practice","270284675_Analyzing_educators'_online_interactions_a_framework_of_online_learning_support_roles","268310768_African_Fractals_Modern_Computing_and_Indigenous_Design","258198651_COMPUGIRLS'_Standpoint_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_and_its_Effect_on_Girls_of_Color","250144791_Rappin'_Reader_and_Say_Say_OH_Playmate_Using_Children's_Childhood_Songs_as_Literacy_Scaffolds_in_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments","247478377_Selections_From_Prison_Notebooks","247316941_Contending_with_Group_Image_The_Psychology_of_Stereotype_and_Social_Identity_Threat","242412547_Voluntary_and_Involuntary_Minorities_A_Cultural-Ecological_Theory_of_School_Performance_With_Some_Implications_for_Education","231835226_The_Javanese_Kijaji_The_Changing_Role_of_a_Cultural_Broker","229552932_When_112_Making_mathematics_in_central_Brazil","228017060_Aspects_of_Group_Relations_in_a_Complex_Society_Mexico1","225083682_The_Forms_of_Capital","46497414_An_empirical_analysis_of_'acting_white'","20781193_Culture_Brokering_in_Migrant_Farmworker_Health_Care","5186057_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_'Acting_White'"]}
