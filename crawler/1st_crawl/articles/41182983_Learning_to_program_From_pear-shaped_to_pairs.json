{"id":"41182983_Learning_to_program_From_pear-shaped_to_pairs","abstract":"The consistently high failure rate in Queensland University of Technologyâ€™s introductory programming\nsubject reflects a similar dilemma facing other universities worldwide. Experiments were conducted to\nquantify the effectiveness of collaborative learning on introductory level programming students over a\nnumber of semesters, replicating previous studies in this area. A selection of workshops in the introductory\nprogramming subject required students to problem-solve and program in pairs, mimicking the eXtreme\nProgramming concept of pair programming. The failure rate for the subject fell from what had been an\naverage of 30% since 2003 (with a high of 41% in 2006), to just 5% for those students who worked\nconsistently in pairs.","authors":["Donna Teague","Paul Roe"],"meta":["January 2009"],"references":["255645790_Learning_programming_by_programming_a_case_study","234820707_Broadening_participation_in_computing_Issues_and_challenges","234794070_Women_in_CS_and_biology","234782152_The_next_wave_of_gender_projects_in_IT_curriculum_teaching_at_universities","234779349_Adopting_XP_Practices_for_Teaching_Object_Oriented_Programming","228951124_In_Support_of_Pair_Programming_in_the_Introductory_Computer_Science_Course","313445271_Developing_collaborative_skills_early_in_the_CS_curriculum_in_a_laboratory_environment","305196412_Collaborative_Learning_Enhances_Critical_Thinking","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","234826597_Why_students_drop_out_CS1_course"]}
