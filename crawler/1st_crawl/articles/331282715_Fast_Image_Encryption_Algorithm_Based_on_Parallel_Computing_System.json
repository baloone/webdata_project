{"id":"331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","abstract":"To ensure security, image encryption algorithms generally include two stages: permutation and diffusion. The traditional image permutation algorithms include the sort-based permutation algorithm, Arnold-based permutation algorithm, Baker-based permutation algorithm and the cyclic shift permutation algorithm, etc. However, these algorithms have the disadvantages of either high time complexity or poor permutation performance. Therefore, in combination with cyclic shift and sorting, this paper proposes a permutation algorithm that can not only guarantees good permutation performance but also guarantee low time and space complexity. Most importantly, this paper proposes a parallel diffusion method. This method ensures the parallelism of diffusion to the utmost extent and achieves a qualitative improvement in efficiency over traditional streaming diffusion methods. Finally, combined with the proposed permutation and diffusion, the paper proposes a computational model for parallel image encryption algorithms.","authors":["Wang Xingyuan","Feng Le","Zhao Hongyu"],"meta":["February 2019Information Sciences 486(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2019.02.049"],"references":["326133347_A_Design_of_Autonomous_Error-Tolerant_Architectures_for_Massively_Parallel_Computing","323227362_Optical_double_color_image_encryption_scheme_in_the_Fresnel-based_Hartley_domain_using_Arnold_transform_and_chaotic_logistic_adjusted_sine_phase_masks","321262287_Performance_prediction_of_parallel_computing_models_to_analyze_cloud-based_big_data_applications","317174397_Quantum_image_encryption_scheme_with_iterative_generalized_Arnold_transforms_and_quantum_image_cycle_shift_operations","307997134_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_Baker_map_with_varying_parameter","292074684_Image_encryption_scheme_using_chaos_and_simulated_annealing_algorithm","291689904_An_effective_and_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_Chaos_and_interweaving_of_ranks","285401867_An_efficient_and_noise_resistive_selective_image_encryption_scheme_for_gray_images_based_on_chaotic_maps_and_DNA_complementary_rules","284929720_Fast_and_efficient_randomized_encryption_scheme_for_digital_images_based_on_Quadtree_decomposition_and_reversible_memory_cellular_automata","262392293_Harvesting_visual_concepts_for_image_search_with_complex_queries","323347158_An_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Josephus_Traversing_and_Mixed_Chaotic_Map","318848165_Image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_multiple_mixed_hash_functions_and_cyclic_shift","315914560_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_bit-level_improved_Arnold_transform_and_hyper_chaotic_map","313810848_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_shuffling_method","312471115_Phase_image_encryption_in_the_fractional_Hartley_domain_using_Arnold_transform_and_singular_value_decomposition","312402126_Symmetric_color_image_encryption_algorithm_using_fractional_DRPM_and_chaotic_baker_map","309738650_Action2Activity_Recognizing_Complex_Activities_from_Sensor_Data","307533293_A_novel_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_using_DNA_sequence_operations","301273723_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_map","299346134_An_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_the_MLNCML_system_using_DNA_sequences","296693069_A_novel_lossless_color_image_encryption_scheme_using_2D_DWT_and_6D_hyperchaotic_system","296473643_A_Distributed_Graph-Parallel_Computing_System_with_Lightweight_Communication_Overhead","293195955_Novel_Quantum_image_encryption_using_one-dimensional_quantum_cellular_automata","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","284277589_On_very_large_scale_test_collection_for_landmark_image_search_benchmarking","284122025_From_Action_to_Activity_Sensor-Based_Activity_Recognition","283890366_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_genetic_recombination_and_hyper-chaotic_systems","283872004_A_novel_bit-level_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_maps","282675599_A_novel_hybrid_color_image_encryption_algorithm_using_two_complex_chaotic_systems","276120197_On_Robust_Image_Spam_Filtering_via_Comprehensive_Visual_Modeling","275672459_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_scheme_using_DNA_sequence_operations","270455688_A_color_image_encryption_with_heterogeneous_bit-permutation_and_correlated_chaos","262191712_A_symmetric_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_mixed_linear-nonlinear_coupled_map_lattice","260214195_Spatiotemporal_chaos_in_mixed_linear-nonlinear_coupled_logistic_map_lattice","257635646_Image_encryption_using_DNA_complementary_rule_and_chaotic_maps","256721123_Local_Shanon_Entropy_Measure_with_Statistical_Tests_for_Image_Randomness","254004926_Oracle_in_Image_Search_A_Content-Based_Approach_to_Performance_Prediction","222443762_Pattern_dynamics_in_spatiotemporal_chaos_Pattern_selection_diffusion_of_defect_and_pattern_competition_intermettency","222392026_A_chaos-based_symmetric_image_encryption_scheme_using_a_bit-level_permutation","221828747_A_chaos-based_digital_image_encryption_scheme_with_an_improved_diffusion_strategy"]}
