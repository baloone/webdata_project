{"id":"318964469_A_Hierarchical_Learning_Control_Framework_for_an_Aerial_Manipulation_System","abstract":"A hierarchical learning control framework for an aerial manipulation system is proposed. Firstly, the mechanical design of aerial manipulation system is introduced and analyzed, and the kinematics and the dynamics based on Newton-Euler equation are modeled. Secondly, the framework of hierarchical learning for this system is presented, in which flight platform and manipulator are controlled by different controller respectively. The RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural networks are employed to estimate parameters and control. The Simulation and experiment demonstrate that the methods proposed effective and advanced.","authors":["Le Ma","yanxun Chi","Jiapeng Li","Zhongsheng Li"],"meta":["July 2017IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 224(1):012030","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/224/1/012030"],"references":["286702934_Selective_compliance_control_for_an_unmanned_aerial_vehicle_with_a_robotic_arm","286275844_A_Survey_of_Modelling_and_Identification_of_Quadrotor_Robot","282885826_Strategy_of_dynamic_modeling_and_predictive_control_on_3-dof_rotorcraft_aerial_manipulator_system","272845237_Mechanical_Design_Modelling_and_Control_of_a_Novel_Aerial_Manipulator","273393262_Stability_of_Helicopters_in_Compliant_Contact_Under_PD-PID_Control","255786198_Multirotor_Aerial_Vehicles_Modeling_Estimation_and_Control_of_Quadrotor"]}
