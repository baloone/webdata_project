{"id":"304021399_Diversified_Top-k_Subgraph_Querying_in_a_Large_Graph","abstract":"Subgraph querying in a large data graph is interesting for different applications. A recent study shows that top-k diversified results are useful since the number of matching subgraphs can be very large. In this work, we study the problem of top-k diversified subgraph querying that asks for a set of up to k subgraphs isomorphic to a given query graph, and that covers the largest number of vertices. We propose a novel level-based algorithm for this problem which supports early termination and has a theoretical approximation guarantee. From experiments, most of our results on real datasets used in previous works are near optimal with a query time within 10ms on a commodity machine.","authors":["Zhengwei Yang","Ada W.
