{"id":"325409463_SENSOR-TOPOLOGY_BASED_SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX_RECONSTRUCTION_FROM_MOBILE_LASER_SCANNING","abstract":"We propose a new method for the reconstruction of simplicial complexes (combining points, edges and triangles) from 3D point clouds from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS). Our main goal is to produce a reconstruction of a scene that is adapted to the local geometry of objects. Our method uses the inherent topology of the MLS sensor to define a spatial adjacency relationship between points. We then investigate each possible connexion between adjacent points and filter them by searching collinear structures in the scene, or structures perpendicular to the laser beams. Next, we create triangles for each triplet of self-connected edges. Last, we improve this method with a regularization based on the co-planarity of triangles and collinearity of remaining edges. We compare our results to a naive simplicial complexes reconstruction based on edge length.","authors":["St√©phane Guinard","Bruno Vallet"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-121-2018","Project: Simplicial complexes reconstruction from 3D LiDAR point clouds"],"references":["278798250_State_of_the_Art_in_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","274676667_Change_Detection_in_3D_Point_Clouds_Acquired_by_a_Mobile_Mapping_System","273525630_TerraMobilitaiQmulus_Urban_Point_Cloud_Analysis_Benchmark","256230377_Feature-Preserving_Surface_Reconstruction_and_Simplification_from_Defect-Laden_Point_Sets","236846208_Stereopolis_II_A_multi-purpose_and_multi-sensor_3D_mobile_mapping_system_for_street_visualisation_and_3D_metrology","221316494_Voronoi-based_variational_reconstruction_of_unoriented_point_sets","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","304781975_Efficient_large-scale_3D_mobile_mapping_and_surface_reconstruction_of_an_underground_mine","222837782_Knowledge_based_reconstruction_of_building_models_from_terrestrial_laser_scanning_data","220721618_Progressive_simplicial_complexes","40006271_Grammar_Supported_Facade_Reconstruction_from_Mobile_LIDAR_Mapping","26551591_A_Comprehensive_Automated_3D_Approach_for_Building_Extraction_Reconstruction_and_Regularization_from_Airborne_Laser_Scanning_Point_Clouds","2258823_Sampling_and_Reconstructing_Manifolds_Using_Alpha-Shapes","220506142_An_Optimal_Transport_Approach_to_Robust_Reconstruction_and_Simplification_of_2D_Shapes"]}
