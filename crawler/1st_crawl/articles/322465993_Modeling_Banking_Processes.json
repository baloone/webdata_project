{"id":"322465993_Modeling_Banking_Processes","abstract":"This paper describes modeling of banking processes provided by information technology (IT) services by capturing and conceptually describing the processes in a holistic manner to facilitate understanding by the IT organization. Banks have found that streamlining processes across organizational units, products, customers, and even geographies leads to real savings while improving ratio of cost to savings. A process refers to a series of activities, each of which is activated as a result of triggers occurring within its network. Currently, diagramming languages such as UML and PBMN are used in this context. This paper applies a new representation method based on the notion of flow of things. The result indicates a viable approach to representing bank processes in an integrated manner.","authors":["Sabah Al-Fedaghi","Mahmoud Wael Behbehani"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1109/INFOCT.2018.8356838","Conference: 2018 International Conference on Information and Computer Technologies (ICICT 2018)At: DeKalb, IL, USA"],"references":["322007324_Modeling_of_an_Enterprise_and_Information_System_Process_Specification_Based_on_the_Flow_of_Things","320624621_Software_Engineering_Modeling_Applied_to_English_Verb_Classification_and_Poetry","267200743_Object-Oriented_Database_Connectivity_for_Hand_Held_Devices","225955640_Analysis_and_Design_of_Business_Processes_Using_BPMN","324060686_Writing_Security_Specification_with_Things_That_Flow","322072273_Toward_Understanding_Dynamic_Behavior_in_Abstract_Machines","320508080_Integrated_Modeling_Methodologies_and_Languages","319351074_Orientation_in_Conceptual_Modeling_Frameworks","312665036_Flow-based_systems_modelling_application_in_airport_system_description"]}
