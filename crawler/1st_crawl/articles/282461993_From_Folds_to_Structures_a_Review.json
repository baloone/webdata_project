{"id":"282461993_From_Folds_to_Structures_a_Review","abstract":"Starting from simple notions of paper folding, a review of current challenges regarding folds and structures is presented. A special focus is dedicated to folded tessellations which are raising interest from the scientific community. Finally, the different mechanical modeling of folded structures are investigated. This reveals efficient applications of folding concepts in the design of structures.","authors":["Arthur Leb√©e"],"meta":["June 2015International Journal of Space Structures 30(2):55-74","DOI:10.1260/0266-3511.30.2.55"],"references":["294259095_Folding_Rigid_Origami_With_Closure_Constraints","289554770_Designing_of_self-deploying_origami_structures_using_geometrically_misaligned_crease_patterns","344170400_Reconstructing_David_Huffman's_Origami_Tessellations","328941861_Origami_Design_Secrets_Mathematical_Methods_for_an_Ancient_Art","317880345_P35_Development_of_Newly_Designed_Ultra-Light_Core_StructuresSHORT_ORAL_PRESENTATION_FOR_POSTERS_II","313432671_Curved_Folded_Plate_Timber_Structures","312138437_Stiffness_and_failure_behaviour_of_folded_sandwich_cores_under_combined_transverse_shear_and_compression","309109734_2-D_array_experiment_on_board_a_space_flyer_unit","290486823_Reconstructing_David_Huffman's_Legacy_in_Curved-Crease_Folding","284670779_Zeta-core_sandwich_-_Its_concept_and_realization"]}
