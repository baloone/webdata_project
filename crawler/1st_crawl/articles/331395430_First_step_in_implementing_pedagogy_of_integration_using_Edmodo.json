{"id":"331395430_First_step_in_implementing_pedagogy_of_integration_using_Edmodo","abstract":"Edmodo is become increasingly used in higher education. It helps teachers to easily share learning contents with students, and better communicate with them. Many researches demonstrate its effectiveness in improving students' results and satisfaction about the learning process. In this paper we describe our experience using Edmodo for a course in assembly language programming delivered in a blended learning mode. The learning scenario adopted for this course was already presented in our previous work on the pedagogy of integration. Results show that the implementation of our scenario model of the pedagogy of integration using Edmodo enhances both learning and teaching experiences.","authors":["Imane Ryane","Nour-eddine El Faddouli"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1145/3289402.3289541","Conference: the 12th International Conference","Project: e-learning"],"references":["310506533_Multidisciplinary_methods_in_educational_technology_research_and_development","296703553_Online_collaboration_for_English_learners_Implementing_and_international_project_with_Edmodo","287329867_M-learning_in_Nigerian_higher_education_An_experimental_study_with_Edmodo","275908791_Interactive_Youth_New_Citizenship_between_Social_Networks_and_School_Settings","275542807_Learning_Outcomes_and_Student_Perceptions_in_Using_of_Blended_Learning_in_History","272692485_The_Improvement_of_Students'_Academic_Performance_by_Using_Social_Media_through_Collaborative_Learning_in_Malaysian_Higher_Education","265253213_A_Study_on_Student_Preference_towards_the_Use_of_Edmodo_as_a_Learning_Platform_to_Create_Responsible_Learning_Environment","222863721_Blended_Learning_Uncovering_Its_Transformative_Potential_in_Higher_Education","282666821_Towards_a_Better_Adoption_of_the_Pedagogy_of_Integration_within_the_Moroccan_Educational_System","277753519_Stories_Models_and_Examples_from_the_Upcoming_Handbook_of_Blended_Learning_Global_Perspectives_Local_Designs_Part_2","266630082_Towards_a_Better_Adoption_of_the_Pedagogy_of_Integration_within_the_Moroccan_Educational_System","265346658_Microblogging_in_Higher_Education_The_Edmodo_Case_Study_among_Computer_Science_Learners_in_Finland","259143623_Mobile_Computing_Devices_in_Higher_Education_Student_Perspectives_on_Learning_with_Cellphones_Smartphones_Social_Media","235316599_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_1"]}
