{"id":"345719755_Centralized_Fog_Computing_Security_Platform_for_IoT_and_Cloud_in_Healthcare_System","abstract":"This chapter proposes an efficient centralized secure architecture for end to end integration of IoT based healthcare system deployed in Cloud environment. The proposed platform uses Fog Computing environment to run the framework. In this chapter, health data is collected from sensors and collected sensor data are securely sent to the near edge devices. Finally, devices transfer the data to the cloud for seamless access by healthcare professionals. Security and privacy for patients' medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. The main focus of this work is to secure Authentication and Authorization of all the devices, Identifying and Tracking the devices deployed in the system, Locating and tracking of mobile devices, new things deployment and connection to existing system, Communication among the devices and data transfer between remote healthcare systems. The proposed system uses asynchronous communication between the applications and data servers deployed in the cloud environment.","authors":["Chandu Thota","Revathi Sundarasekar","Gunasekaran Manogaran","Varatharajan R"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.4018/978-1-5225-2947-7.ch011","In book: Exploring the Convergence of Big Data and the Internet of Things (pp.141-154)"],"references":["303810349_A_Fluctuation-Based_Modelling_Approach_to_Quantification_of_the_Technical_Debt_on_Mobile_Cloud-Based_Service_Level","303302092_Big_data-driven_optimization_for_mobile_networks_toward_5G","299471498_Climate_change_and_disease_dynamics_-_A_big_data_perspective","270880243_Smart_e-Health_Gateway_Bringing_Intelligence_to_Internet-of-Things_Based_Ubiquitous_Healthcare_Systems","221548933_Securing_Medical_Sensor_Environments_The_CodeBlue_Framework_Case","38413517_CodeBlue_An_Ad_Hoc_Sensor_Network_Infrastructure_for_Emergency_Medical_Care","23469135_Future_delivery_of_health_care_Cybercare","3437071_Sensor_Networks_for_Emergency_Response_Challenges_and_Opportunities","345773997_Big_Data_Security_Framework_for_Distributed_Cloud_Data_Centers","325247756_Disease_Surveillance_System_for_Big_Climate_Data_Processing_and_Dengue_Transmission","322812822_Health_data_analytics_using_scalable_logistic_regression_with_stochastic_gradient_descent","320785937_A_survey_of_big_data_architectures_and_machine_learning_algorithms_in_healthcare","316092329_Spatial_cumulative_sum_algorithm_with_big_data_analytics_for_climate_change_detection","316072195_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","315857599_Big_Data_Security_Intelligence_for_Healthcare_Industry_40","312025191_Big_Data_Knowledge_System_in_Healthcare","303848524_MetaCloudDataStorage_Architecture_for_Big_Data_Security_in_Cloud_Computing","303018373_Assessment_of_Vaccination_Strategies_using_Fuzzy_Multi-_Criteria_Decision_Making","295858864_End-to-End_Security_Scheme_for_Mobility_Enabled_Healthcare_Internet_of_Things","280390770_Spatial_Big_Data_Analytics_of_Influenza_Epidemic_in_Vellore_India","260542095_Compressed_Sensing_Signal_and_Data_Acquisition_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_Internet_of_Things","246998877_On_Certain_Integrals_of_Lipschitz-Hankel_Type_Involving_Products_of_Bessel_Functions","233870762_Smart_Border_Routers_for_eHealthCare_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224210245_Mobility_Support_for_Health_Monitoring_at_Home_Using_Wearable_Sensors","224193065_Intra-mobility_for_Hospital_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_6LoWPAN","221091825_TinySec_A_link_layer_security_architecture_for_wireless_sensor_networks","220775858_HWSN6_Hospital_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Based_on_6LoWPAN_Technology_Mobility_and_Fault_Tolerance_Management","220426090_The_platforms_enabling_wireless_sensor_network"]}
