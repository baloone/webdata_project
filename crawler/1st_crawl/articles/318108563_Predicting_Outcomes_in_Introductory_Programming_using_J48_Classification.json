{"id":"318108563_Predicting_Outcomes_in_Introductory_Programming_using_J48_Classification","abstract":"In Computer Science (CS) major, introductory programming becomes a substantial course which determine whether students can complete that major or not. Thus, this study evaluates the correlation between student data with their capability to pass that course. Such correlation is exploited based on data mining technique which is called J48. For each student, our work incorporates personal, prior education, admission, and assessment data. Based on our evaluation with 41 student data, national test score for mathematics is the most promising attributes, followed with admission test score. The result of this study is expected to provide a brief insight for CS lecturer and university so that they can handle uprising issues in CS education, especially the high retention rate.","authors":["Mewati Ayub","Oscar Karnalim"],"meta":["July 2017World Transactions on Engineering and Technology Education 15(2):132-136"],"references":["220807520_The_Effect_of_Student_Attributes_on_Success_in_Programming","220613063_Interacting_factors_that_predict_success_and_failure_in_a_CS1_course","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","303206384_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","268001177_A_Study_of_Factors_Promoting_Success_in_Computer_Science"]}
