{"id":"260320713_Sketch_Algorithms_for_Estimating_Point_Queries_in_NLP","abstract":"Many NLP tasks rely on accurate statis-tics from large corpora. Tracking com-plete statistics is memory intensive, so recent work has proposed using compact approx-imate \"sketches\" of frequency distributions. We describe 10 sketch methods, including ex-isting and novel variants. We compare and study the errors (over-estimation and under-estimation) made by the sketches. We evaluate several sketches on three important NLP prob-lems. Our experiments show that one sketch performs best for all the three tasks.","authors":["Amit Goyal","Hal Daum√©","Graham Cormode"],"meta":["July 2012"],"references":["234813790_Popularity_is_everything_A_new_approach_to_protecting_passwords_from_statistical-guessing_attacks","228531010_New_estimation_algorithms_for_streaming_data_Count-min_can_do_more","221619859_One_sketch_for_all_Theory_and_Application_of_Conditional_Random_Sampling","221214473_Spectral_Bloom_Filters","220907001_On_Classification_of_High-Cardinality_Data_Streams","220873631_A_Simple_Similarity-based_Model_for_Selectional_Preferences","220817262_Streaming_for_large_scale_NLP_Language_Modeling","220816759_A_Study_on_Similarity_and_Relatedness_Using_Distributional_and_WordNet-based_Approaches","215990714_Hash_Kernels_for_Structured_Data","215470778_The_General_Inquirer_A_Computer_Approach_to_Content_Analysis","200044323_Measuring_Praise_and_Criticism_Inference_of_Semantic_Orientation_from_Association","2477223_Word_Association_Norms_Mutual_Information_and_Lexicography","1772519_A_Uniform_Approach_to_Analogies_Synonyms_Antonyms_and_Associations","308797129_Distributional_structure","261850164_New_directions_in_traffic_measurement_and_accounting","242445578_Approximate_frequency_counts_over_data_streams","238697185_A_synopsis_of_linguistic_theory_1930--1955","232878134_Contextual_Correlates_of_Semantic_Similarity","229099940_A_synopsis_of_linguistic_theory_1930-55","222823543_An_improved_data_stream_summary_The_Count-Min_Sketch_and_its_applications","221620053_Streaming_Pointwise_Mutual_Information","221604129_Lossy_Conservative_Update_LCU_Sketch_Succinct_Approximate_Count_Storage","221463096_Pan-Private_Streaming_Algorithms","221212820_Statistical_analysis_of_sketch_estimators","221013326_Large_Language_Models_in_Machine_Translation","221013173_Stream-based_Randomised_Language_Models_for_SMT","221012915_Discriminative_Learning_of_Selectional_Preference_from_Unlabeled_Text","221012788_Approximate_Scalable_Bounded_Space_Sketch_for_Large_Data_NLP","221012652_Smoothed_Bloom_Filter_Language_Models_Tera-Scale_LMs_on_the_Cheap","220875055_Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences","220874851_Online_Generation_of_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Signatures","220874691_Randomized_Language_Models_via_Perfect_Hash_Functions","220874196_Randomized_Algorithms_and_NLP_Using_Locality_Sensitive_Hash_Functions_for_High_Speed_Noun_Clustering","220815608_Probabilistic_Counting_with_Randomized_Storage","220815097_Succinct_Approximate_Counting_of_Skewed_Data","220538585_Finding_frequent_items_in_data_streams","220424808_SpaceTime_Trade-Offs_in_Hash_Coding_With_Allowable_Errors","2889337_Finding_Frequent_Items_in_Data_Streams","2867751_Chapter_31_Approximate_Frequency_Counts_over_Data_Streams"]}
