{"id":"300131575_Automata-Based_Abstraction_for_Automated_Verification_of_Higher-Order_Tree-Processing_Programs","abstract":"Higher-order model checking has been recently applied to automated verification of higher-order functional programs, but there have been difficulties in dealing with algebraic data types such as lists and trees. To remedy the problem, we propose an automata-based abstraction of tree data, and a counterexample-guided refinement of the abstraction. By combining them with higher-order model checking, we can construct a fully-automated verification tool for higher-order, tree-processing functional programs. We formalize the verification method, prove its correctness, and report experimental results.","authors":["Yuma Matsumoto","Naoki Kobayashi","Hiroshi Unno"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26529-2_16","Conference: Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems"],"references":["266856757_Towards_Static_Analysis_of_Functional_Programs_Using_Tree_Automata_Completion","262312016_Abstract_Refinement_Types","225142568_Z3_an_efficient_SMT_solver","221336395_Model-checking_higher-order_functions","221323270_Verification_of_Tree-Processing_Programs_via_Higher-Order_Model_Checking","220997331_Higher-order_multi-parameter_tree_transducers_and_recursion_schemes_for_program_verification","220752033_Predicate_Abstraction_and_CEGAR_for_Higher-Order_Model_Checking","314854531_Predicate_abstraction_and_CEGAR_for_higher-order_model_checking","308730811_Automata-Based_Abstraction_Refinement_for_HORS_Model_Checking","307174777_Tree_Automata_Techniques_and_Applications","298725106_Verifying_Relational_Properties_of_Functional_Programs_by_First-Order_Refinement","286345189_Saturation-based_model_checking_of_higher-order_recursion_schemes","281959174_Counterexample_finding_and_abstraction_refinment_for_automated_Verification_of_higher-order_tree_transducers","262356782_Towards_a_scalable_software_model_checker_for_higher-order_programs","262322891_Model_Checking_Higher-Order_Programs","232621268_On_Model-Checking_Trees_Generated_by_Higher-Order_Recursion_Schemes","225125542_On_Global_Model_Checking_Trees_Generated_by_Higher-Order_Recursion_Schemes","220997299_Verifying_Higher-Order_Functional_Programs_with_Pattern-Matching_Algebraic_Data_Types","220752199_Type-based_Data_Structure_Verification","3854908_Automatic_structures","2540855_Tree_Automata_Techniques_and_Applications_-_Chapter_5_Tree_Set_Automata"]}
