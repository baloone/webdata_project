{"id":"324122911_Maintenance_Decision-making_Model_Based_on_Markov_Process_for_Traction_Power_Supply_Equipment_and_Its_Application","abstract":"Traditional planned maintenance mode for traction power supply equipment may lead to excessive maintenance or inadequate maintenance. The gradual improvement of information technology of maintenance units and traction substations makes possible the replacement of planned maintenance mode by condition-based maintenance mode. In this paper, the equipment health status was introduced in the maintenance decision-making for traction power supply equipment and a health condition-based maintenance decision-making model was proposed based on Markov decision process. The model took into account the health status deterioration process based on Gauss-Poisson process of the whole life cycle of the equipment and planned preventive maintenance process. With the maintenance cost per unit time of the whole life cycle of the equipment as the optimization goal, the strategy iteration method was used to realize the optimal maintenance mode and maintenance cycle of the traction power supply equipment under different health conditions. Case study proved the validity and effectiveness of the method, which provides a basis for the optimization of maintenance scheme and realization of condition-based maintenance of traction power supply equipment.
