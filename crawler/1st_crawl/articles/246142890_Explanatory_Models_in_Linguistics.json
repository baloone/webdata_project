{"id":"246142890_Explanatory_Models_in_Linguistics","abstract":"A traditional grammar has serious limitations so far as linguistic science is concerned. Its basic inadequacy lies in an essential appeal to what can be only called as the “linguistic intuition” of the intelligent reader. It is important to realize that a taxonomic grammar of the traditional kind is not merely a partial grammar that omits certain facts about the language. The understanding of a reader contributes not in identifying new facts, but a technique for organizing and arranging facts. With diligence and application, an intelligent adult can use a traditional grammar to develop some degree of mastery of a new language. A young child is able to gain perfect mastery of a language with incomparably greater ease and without any explicit instruction. Any serious investigation of syntax will quickly bring to the light peculiarities of distribution that appear to require numerous special and isolated rules. The so-called “anomalous finite verbs” of English provide a simple illustration. A constituent structure grammar containing only rewriting rules can cover all the facts only by a variety of special rules.","authors":["Noam Chomsky"],"meta":["December 1966Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 44","DOI:10.1016/S0049-237X(09)70617-2"],"references":[]}
