{"id":"282001406_Deep_neural_network_based_instrument_extraction_from_music","abstract":"This paper deals with the extraction of an instrument from music by using a deep neural network. As prior information, we only assume to know the instrument types that are present in the mixture and, using this information, we generate the training data from a database with solo instrument performances. The neural network is built up from rectified linear units where each hidden layer has the same number of nodes as the output layer. This allows a least squares initialization of the layer weights and speeds up the training of the network considerably compared to a traditional random initializa-tion. We give results for two mixtures, each consisting of three instruments , and evaluate the extraction performance using BSS Eval for a varying number of hidden layers.","authors":["Stefan Uhlich","Franck Giron","Yuki Mitsufuji"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178348","Conference: ICASSP 2015","Project: Audio Source Separation"],"references":["277866916_Beta_Divergence_for_Clustering_in_Monaural_Blind_Source_Separation","263807651_The_Good_Vibrations_Problem","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","312466014_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Networks","277510183_Algorithm_862","269295108_Deep_learning_for_monaural_speech_separation","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262877467_Blind_Source_Separation_Advances_in_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","261159435_On_rectified_linear_units_for_speech_processing","260693018_REpeating_Pattern_Extraction_Technique_REPET_A_Simple_Method_for_MusicVoice_Separation"]}
