{"id":"268691822_Machine_learning_fMRI_classifier_delineates_subgroups_of_schizophrenia_patients","abstract":"The search for a validated neuroimaging-based brain marker in psychiatry has thus far been fraught with both clinical and methodological difficulties. The present study aimed to apply a novel data-driven machine-learning approach to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data obtained during a cognitive task in order to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in two schizophrenia subgroups: schizophrenia patients with and without Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD).Methods16 schizophrenia patients with OCD (“schizo-obsessive”), 17 pure schizophrenia patients, and 20 healthy controls underwent fMRI while performing a working memory task. A whole brain search for activation clusters of cognitive load was performed using a recently developed data-driven multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach, termed Searchlight Based Feature Extraction (SBFE), and which yields a robust fMRI-based classifier.ResultsThe SBFE successfully classified the two schizophrenia groups with 91% accuracy based on activations in the right intraparietal sulcus (r-IPS), which further correlated with reduced symptom severity among schizo-obsessive patients.Conclusions\nThe results indicate that this novel SBFE approach can successfully delineate between symptom dimensions in the context of complex psychiatric morbidity.","authors":["Maya Bleich-Cohen","Shahar Jamshy","Haggai Sharon","Ronit Weizman"],"meta":["November 2014Schizophrenia Research 160(1-3)","DOI:10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.033"],"references":["47403014_Developing_Constructs_for_Psychopathology_Research_Research_Domain_Criteria","41414635_Comparative_Analysis_of_Cognitive_Function_in_Schizophrenia_with_and_without_Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder","23798470_Revealing_representational_content_with_pattern-information_fMRI_-_An_introductory_guide","23651574_Machine_learning_classifiers_and_fMRI_A_tutorial_overview","10761697_Callicott_JH_An_expanded_role_for_functional_neuroimaging_in_schizophrenia_Curr_Opin_Neurobiol_13_256-260","7242010_Information-based_functional_brain_mapping","5577415_fMRI_Activity_Patterns_in_Human_LOC_Carry_Information_about_Object_Exemplars_within_Category","278666190_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","261182701_From_Circuit_Activity_to_Network_Connectivity_and_Back_The_Case_of_Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder","247661144_Structured_clinical_interview_for_DSM-IV_Axis-II_disorders","243966213_The_effect_of_obsessive-compulsive_symptomatology_on_executive_functions_in_schizophrenia_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","237839788_Working_memory_dysfunction_in_schizophrenia_patients_with_obsessive-compulsive_symptoms_An_fMRI_study","235378697_Neural_correlates_of_executive_functions_in_healthy_G2019S_LRRK2_mutation_carriers","232495554_Modified_Scale_for_the_Assessment_of_Negative_Symptoms_SANS","221806586_Using_Support_Vector_Machine_to_identify_imaging_biomarkers_of_neurological_and_psychiatric_disease_A_critical_review","221764261_Functional_integration_of_parietal_lobe_activity_in_early_Alzheimer_disease","220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","51875960_Does_feature_selection_improve_classification_accuracy_Impact_of_sample_size_and_feature_selection_on_classification_using_anatomical_magnetic_resonance_images","51755374_Obsessive-compulsive_symptoms_in_schizophrenia_Implications_for_future_psychiatric_classifications","41175500_Effective_Functional_Mapping_of_fMRI_Data_with_Support-Vector_Machines","20472318_The_Yale-Brown_Obsessive_Compulsive_Scale_I_Development_use_and_reliability","12713739_Obsessive-compulsive_disorder_in_patients_with_first-episode_schizophrenia","12358018_Ventricular_enlargement_in_schizophrenia_spectrum_patients_with_prodromal_symptoms_of_obsessive-compulsive_disorder","7493386_Mourao-Miranda_J_Bokde_AL_Born_C_Hampel_H_Stetter_M_Classifying_brain_states_and_determining_the_discriminating_activation_patterns_support_vector_machine_on_functional_MRI_data_NeuroImage_28_980-995","5895402_Pattern_Classification_of_Sad_Facial_Processing_Toward_the_Development_of_Neurobiological_Markers_in_Depression"]}
