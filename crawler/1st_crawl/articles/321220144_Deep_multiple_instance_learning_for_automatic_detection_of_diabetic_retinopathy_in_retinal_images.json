{"id":"321220144_Deep_multiple_instance_learning_for_automatic_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_in_retinal_images","abstract":"As a weakly supervised learning technique, multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown an advantage over supervised learning methods for automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR): only the image-level annotation is needed to achieve both detection of DR images and DR lesions, making more graded and de-identified retinal images available for learning. However, the performance of existing studies on this technique is limited by the use of handcrafted features. The authors propose a deep MIL method for DR detection, which jointly learns features and classifiers from data and achieves a significant improvement on detecting DR images and their inside lesions. Specifically, a pre-trained convolutional neural network is adapted to achieve the patch-level DR estimation, and then global aggregation is used to make the classification of DR images. Further, the authors propose an end-to-end multi-scale scheme to better deal with the irregular DR lesions. For detection of DR images, they achieve an area under the ROC curve of 0.925 on a subset of a Kaggle dataset, and 0.960 on Messidor. For detection of DR lesions, they achieve an F1-score of 0.924 with sensitivity 0.995 and precision 0.863 on DIARETDB1 using the connected component-level validation.","authors":["Lei Zhou","Yu Zhao","Jie Yang","Qi Yu"],"meta":["November 2017Image Processing, IET 12(4)","DOI:10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.0636"],"references":["304002663_Classifying_and_segmenting_microscopy_images_with_deep_multiple_instance_learning","297659797_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Medical_Image_Analysis_Fine_Tuning_or_Full_Training","293012616_Multi-Instance_Deep_Learning_Discover_Discriminative_Local_Anatomies_for_Bodypart_Recognition","288001997_Red_Lesion_Detection_Using_Dynamic_Shape_Features_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Screening","45603253_A_New_Supervised_Method_for_Blood_Vessel_Segmentation_in_Retinal_Images_by_Using_Gray-Level_and_Moment_Invariants-Based_Features","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","308999955_Detection_of_exudates_in_fundus_photographs_using_deep_neural_networks_and_anatomical_landmark_detection_fusion","306276482_Improved_Automated_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_on_a_Publicly_Available_Dataset_Through_Integration_of_Deep_Learning","304408732_Simpler_Non-Parametric_Methods_Provide_as_Good_or_Better_Results_to_Multiple-Instance_Learning","301732947_Guest_Editorial_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Imaging_Overview_and_Future_Promise_of_an_Exciting_New_Technique","293640715_Fast_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Training_Using_Selective_Data_Sampling_Application_to_Hemorrhage_Detection_in_Color_Fundus_Images","288918787_Automatic_detection_of_referral_patients_due_to_retinal_pathologies_through_data_mining","269187621_Computer-aided_diagnosis_from_weak_supervision_A_benchmarking_study","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","260015440_An_ensemble-based_system_for_automatic_screening_of_diabetic_retinopathy","259510585_Global_estimates_of_diabetes_prevalence_for_2013_and_projections_for_2035_for_the_IDF_Diabetes_Atlas","259045011_Computer-aided_diagnosis_of_diabetic_retinopathy_A_review","258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","230591867_A_multiple-instance_learning_framework_for_diabetic_retinopathy_screening","228114038_Multimodal_Retinal_Vessel_Segmentation_From_Spectral-Domain_Optical_Coherence_Tomography_and_Fundus_Photography","222481041_Solving_the_Multiple_Instance_Problem_with_Axis-Parallel_Rectangles","221259835_DIARETDB1_diabetic_retinopathy_database_and_evaluation_protocol","49809077_Optimal_Filter_Framework_for_Automated_Instantaneous_Detection_of_Lesions_in_Retinal_Images"]}
