{"id":"220358877_An_efficient_parallel_strategy_for_the_perfect_domination_problem_on_distance-hereditary_graphs","abstract":"A graph is distance-hereditary if the distance stays the same between any of two vertices in every connected induced subgraph containing both. Two well-known\nclasses of graphs, trees and cographs, both belong to distance-hereditary graphs. In this paper, we first show that the perfect\ndomination problem can be solved in sequential linear-time on distance-hereditary graphs. By sketching some regular property\nof the problem, we also show that it can be easily parallelized on distance-hereditary graphs.","authors":["Sun-Yuan Hsieh"],"meta":["January 2007The Journal of Supercomputing 39(1):39-57","DOI:10.1007/s11227-006-0003-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["279310296_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Upper_Domination","245310437_Note_A_note_on_'optimal_payment_time_under_permissible_delay_in_payment_for_products_with_deterioration'","229605706_Dominating_sets_in_n-cubes","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","223032823_Distance-hereditary_graphs","221209413_Dominating_Cliques_in_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","220616758_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs_Steiner_Trees_and_Connected_Domination","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220181029_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Some_Perfect_Graph_Classes","3300676_An_efficient_parallel_algorithm_for_the_efficient_domination_problem_on_distance-hereditary_graphs","302558561_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","279055455_Efficient_parallel_algorithms_on_distance-hereditary_graphs_extended_abstract","278425651_Characterization_of_efficiently_parallel_solvable_problems_on_distance-hereditary_graphs","267470494_The_weighted_perfect_domination_problem","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","250956109_The_kDomination_and_kStability_Problems_on_Sun-Free_Chordal_Graphs","243768649_Hamiltonian_problems_on_distance-hereditary_graphs","234819609_R_-Domination_in_Graphs","230596019_On_the_Algorithmic_Complexity_of_Total_Domination","229008801_The_path-partition_problem_in_bipartite_distance-hereditary_graphs","228057792_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Shared_Memory_Machines","225630410_On_domination_related_concepts_in_Graph_Theory","223071318_Labeling_algorithms_for_domination_problems_in_sun-free_chordal_graphs","223060190_Completely_separable_graphs","222553514_A_Simple_Paradigm_for_Graph_Recognition_Application_to_Cographs_and_Distance_Hereditary_Graphs","222541224_A_Faster_Implementation_of_a_Parallel_Tree_Contraction_Scheme_and_Its_Application_on_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","222510858_A_Simple_Parallel_Tree_Contraction_Algorithm","222194255_Efficient_parallel_recognition_algorithms_of_cographs_and_distance_hereditary_graphs","221644550_Parallel_Decomposition_of_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","221543557_Dynamic_Programming_on_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","221426745_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Hamiltonian_Problem_on_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","220688506_An_Introduction_to_Parallel_Algorithms","220586904_Hamiltonian_Cycle_Problem_on_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","220569454_The_Hamiltonian_problem_on_distance-hereditary_graphs","220568481_The_Weighted_Perfect_Domination_Problem_and_Its_Variants","220439684_Efficient_Parallel_Algorithms_on_Distance_Hereditary_Graphs","220209624_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Connected_r-Domination_and_Steiner_Tree_on_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","220150248_Weighted_connected_-domination_and_weighted_-dominating_clique_in_distance-hereditary_graphs","220114433_Polynomial_Time_Algorithms_for_Hamiltonian_Problems_on_Bipartite_Distance-Hereditary_Graphs","220113097_A_Linear_Algorithm_for_the_Domination_Number_of_a_Tree","31262180_A_characterization_of_distance-hereditary_graphs","2731134_Weighted_connected_domination_and_Steiner_trees_in_distance-hereditary_graphs_Extended_abstract"]}
