{"id":"281368033_Phase-shift_fault_analysis_of_Trivium","abstract":"This paper deals with the phase-shift fault analysis of cipher Trivium. So far, only bit-flipping technique has been presented in the literature. The best fault attack on Trivium [13] combines bit-flipping with algebraic cryptanalysis and needs to induce 2 one-bit faults and to generate 420 bits per each keystream. Our attack combines phase-shifting and algebraic cryptanalysis and needs to phase-shift 2 registers of the cipher and to generate 120 bits per each keystream.","authors":["Viliam Hromada","Juraj Varga"],"meta":["June 2015Studia Scientiarum Mathematicarum Hungarica 52(2):205-220","DOI:10.1556/012.2015.52.2.1308"],"references":["262217067_ElimLin_Algorithm_Revisited","262215215_Solving_Trivium-based_Boolean_Equations_Using_the_Method_of_Syllogisms","278653474_Introduction_How_to_Use_this_Book","221540878_Floating_Fault_Analysis_of_Trivium","221291571_Fault_Analysis_of_Stream_Ciphers","220944525_Attacking_Bivium_Using_SAT_Solvers"]}
