{"id":"271218384_Optimal_hot_rolling_production_scheduling_for_economic_load_dispatch_under_time-of-use_electricity_pricing","abstract":"Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing provides a new opportunity for\nindustrial user to reduce their power costs and improve the efficiency of power\nenergy. Although many methods for Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) under TOU\npricing in continuous process industry have been proposed, there is difficulty\nin batch-type process industry because of that the power load units are not\nfixed but closely related with production planning and scheduling. In this\npaper, for hot rolling, a typical batch-type and energy intensive process in\nsteel industry, a multi-objective production scheduling optimization model for\nELD is proposed under TOU pricing, in which the objective is to minimize the\npower costs on the premise of ensuring the product quality. A NSGA-II based\nproduction scheduling algorithm is proposed to generate Pareto-optimal\nsolutions, and then the TOPSIS based multi-criteria decision-making is\nperformed to recommend an optimal solution to facilitate filed operation.\nExperimental results on practical production data show that the proposed method\ncut down the power costs by creating load units corresponding to electricity\nprice and shifting loads to avoid on-peak time periods.","authors":["Mao Tan","Bin Duan","Yongxin Su","Feng He"],"meta":["March 2017Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2017(12)","DOI:10.1155/2017/1048081","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281966238_Scheduling_on_a_single_machine_under_time-of-use_electricity_tariffs","271960234_A_hybrid_NSGA-II_and_VNS_for_solving_a_bi-objective_no-wait_flexible_flowshop_scheduling_problem","330356933_Multiple_attribute_decision_making_Methods_and_applications","317219370_A_fast_elitist_non-dominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_for_multi-objective_optimization_NSGA-II","300473471_Hot_Strip_Mill_Scheduling_Under_Consideration_of_Energy_Consumption","287761053_Energy_optimization_of_medium_plate_rolling_schedule_based_on_improved_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","282563228_A_new_hybrid_algorithm_of_scatter_search_and_Nelder-Mead_algorithms_to_optimize_joint_economic_lot_sizing_problem","263375278_A_multi-objective_optimisation_algorithm_for_the_hot_rolling_batch_scheduling_problem","261268993_An_integrated_optimization_model_for_generation_and_batch_production_load_scheduling_in_energy_intensive_enterprise","261153397_Multi-objective_optimization_of_rolling_schedules_for_tandem_hot_rolling_based_on_opposition_learning_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm"]}
