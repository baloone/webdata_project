{"id":"309284024_A_Neural_Network_Approach_to_Predicting_and_Computing_Knot_Invariants","abstract":"In this paper we use artificial neural networks to predict and help compute the values of certain knot invariants. In particular, we show that neural networks are able to predict when a knot is quasipositive with a high degree of accuracy. Given a knot with unknown quasipositivity we use these predictions to identify braid representatives that are likely to be quasipositive, which we then subject to further testing to verify. Using these techniques we identify 84 new quasipositive 11 and 12-crossing knots. Furthermore, we show that neural networks are also able to predict and help compute the slice genus and Ozsv\\'{a}th-Szab\\'{o} $\\tau$-invariant of knots.","authors":["Mark C.
