{"id":"265101755_Class_Break_Point_Determination_Using_CK_Metrics_Thresholds","abstract":"The design and development of any project has got a well-defined project development cycle. But once the project or the product has been developed, it is subject to change due a lot a policy changes on the part of the organization or the government. These changes are implemented on the code but most of the time these changes are not reflected on the design document. This leads to inconsistencies in terms of design and code thereby causing depreciation in terms of quality. In this work we propose to use the object oriented metrics which uses the parameters mentioned in the CK metrics suite to assess the quality of the software at the class level. The proposed tool namely ―Class Break Point‖ which could be used to determine the class design validity. This tool can be used to check if the class is adhering to the OO design specifications. The tool is useful in predicting the decomposition point of the class.","authors":["E Chandra","P Edith Linda"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["3189649_Empirical_Analysis_of_Object-Oriented_Design_Metrics_for_Predicting_High_and_Low_Severity_Faults","3188321_Empirical_Analysis_of_CK_Metrics_for_Object-Oriented_Design_Complexity_Implications_for_Software_Defects","305296096_Towards_a_Metrics_Suite_for_Object_Oriented_Design","234780737_The_Practical_Implementation_of_Software_Metrics","220691208_Managing_Software_Process"]}
