{"id":"289427964_Slot_scheduling_for_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"In wireless sensor networks (WSN), one of the most important challenges is power saving, then various contributions are suggested since a decade. In this paper, we propose a distributed and adaptive gossiping technique able to guarantee communications over all sensors and to save a high amount of energy. The aim is to allow to the network to achieve a self-organizing procedure in order to provide an efficient structuring approach for communications over all sensors. The medium access will be TDMA (Time Division Medium Access) like. Indeed, each sensor will have a particular slot for listening and another one for sending. The slot assignment is achieved in a distributed manner and is continuously reconfigurable. That means when a sensor leaves the network, its assigned slot will be recovered and when a new one wants to join the network, the last available slot will be assigned to it.","authors":["Thibault Bernard","Hac√®ne Fouchal"],"meta":["November 2012Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering 12:1-12","DOI:10.3233/JCM-2012-0432"],"references":["220098484_An_energy-efficient_scalable_and_collision-free_MAC_layer_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks"]}
