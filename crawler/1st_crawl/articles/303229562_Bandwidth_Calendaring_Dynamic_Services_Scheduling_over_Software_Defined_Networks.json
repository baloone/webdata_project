{"id":"303229562_Bandwidth_Calendaring_Dynamic_Services_Scheduling_over_Software_Defined_Networks","abstract":"Software Defined Networking enables centralized network control and hence paves the way for new services that use network resources more efficiently. Bandwidth Calendaring (BWC) is a typical such example that exploits the knowledge of future to optimally pack the arising demands over the network. In this paper, we consider a generic BWC instance, where a carrier network operator has to accommodate at minimum cost demands of predetermined, but time-varying, bandwidth requirements. Some of the demands may be flexible, i.e., can be scheduled within a specific time window. We demonstrate that the resulting problem is NP-hard and we propose a scalable problem decomposition based on column generation. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed solution approach is near-optimal and outperforms state-of-the art methods based on relaxation and randomized rounding by more than 20% in terms of network cost.","authors":["Lazaros Gkatzikis","Stefano Paris","Ioannis Stiakogiannakis","Symeon Chouvardas"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2016.7510888","Conference: IEEE ICC 2016At: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"references":["266660161_Dynamic_Scheduling_of_Network_Updates","305513228_BwE_Flexible_Hierarchical_Bandwidth_Allocation_for_WAN_Distributed_Computing","305510314_BwE_Flexible_Hierarchical_Bandwidth_Allocation_for_WAN_Distributed_Computing","285897917_B4_Experience_with_a_globally-deployed_software_defined_WAN","282680369_Guaranteeing_deadlines_for_inter-datacenter_transfers","266660084_Calendaring_for_Wide_Area_Networks","263893802_A_roadmap_for_traffic_engineering_in_SDN-OpenFlow_Networks","262364586_B4_Experience_with_a_Globally-Deployed_Software_Defined_WAN","262250548_Achieving_High_Utilization_with_Software-Driven_WAN","235246925_The_Only_Constant_is_Change_Incorporating_Time-Varying_Network_Reservations_in_Data_Centers"]}
