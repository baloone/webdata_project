{"id":"236896558_FOREX_Daily_Trend_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","abstract":"Foreign Currency Exchange market (Forex) is a\nhighly volatile complex time series for which predicting the\ndaily trend is a challenging problem. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the prediction of the High exchange rate daily\ntrend as a binary classification problem, with uptrend and\ndowntrend outcomes. A large number of basic features\ndriven from the time series data, including technical analysis\nfeatures are generated using multiple history time windows.\nVarious feature selection and feature extraction techniques\nare used to find best subsets for the classification problem.\nMachine learning systems are tested for each feature subset\nand results are analyzed. Four important Forex currency\npairs are investigated and the results show consistent success\nin the daily prediction and in the expected profit.","authors":["Areej Baasher","Mohamed Waleed Fakhr"],"meta":["November 2011","Conference: Wseas-Recent Researches in Applied Informatics and Remote SensingVolume: ISBN: 978-1-61804-039-8","Project: Masters Degree Publication"],"references":["249789555_An_Efficient_Method_for_Variables_Selection_Using_SVM-Based_Criteria","228581394_Forecasting_Volatility-Evidence_from_Indian_Stock_and_Forex_Markets","226762803_Financial_Forecasting_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","224746570_Forecasting_of_currency_exchange_rates_using_ANN_A_case_study","288704154_Using_the_component_garch_modeling_and_forecasting_method_to_determine_the_effect_of_unexpected_exchange_rate_mean_and_volatility_spillover_on_stock_markets","284868064_Time_Series_Analysis_Forecasting_and_Control","265186175_Master's_Thesis_Algorithmic_Trading_Hidden_Markov_Models_on_Foreign_Exchange_Data","243772019_Recognition_using_class_specific_linear_projection","232638202_Mid-long_Term_Load_Forecasting_Using_Hidden_Markov_Model","222735629_Zhang_GP_Time_Series_Forecasting_Using_a_Hybrid_ARIMA_and_Neural_Network_Model_Neurocomputing_50_159-175","221996079_An_Introduction_of_Variable_and_Feature_Selection","24070523_Forecasting_Volatility_in_the_New_Zealand_Stock_Market","221996663_Variable_Selection_Using_SVM_based_Criteria","221619642_Metric_Learning_by_Collapsing_Classes","23794321_A_simple_neural_network_for_ARMApq_time_series"]}
