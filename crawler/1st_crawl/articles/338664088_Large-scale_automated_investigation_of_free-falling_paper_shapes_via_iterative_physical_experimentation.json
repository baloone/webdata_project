{"id":"338664088_Large-scale_automated_investigation_of_free-falling_paper_shapes_via_iterative_physical_experimentation","abstract":"Free-falling paper shapes exhibit rich, complex and varied behaviours that are extremely challenging to model analytically. Physical experimentation aids in system understanding, but is time-consuming, sensitive to initial conditions and reliant on subjective visual behavioural classification. In this study, robotics, computer vision and machine learning are used to autonomously fabricate, drop, analyse and classify the behaviours of hundreds of shapes. The system is validated by reproducing results for falling discs, which exhibit four falling styles: tumbling, chaotic, steady and periodic. A previously determined mapping from a non-dimensional parameter space to behaviour groups is shown to be consistent with these new experiments for tumbling and chaotic behaviours. However, steady or periodic behaviours are observed in previously unseen areas of the parameter space. More complex hexagon, square and cross shapes are investigated, showing that the non-dimensional parameter space generalizes to these shapes. The system highlights the potential of robotics for the investigation of complex physical systems, of which falling paper is one example, and provides a template for future investigation of such systems. The dynamics of paper shapes in free fall are still not fully understood, despite being discussed for more than 150 years. Collecting large amounts of data has the potential to give us new insights and a robotics system could generate and analyse data in large quantities.","authors":["Toby Howison","Josie Hughes","Fumiya Iida"],"meta":["January 2020Nature Machine Intelligence 2(1):1-8","DOI:10.1038/s42256-019-0135-z"],"references":["334059916_Physics_driven_behavioural_clustering_of_free-falling_paper_shapes","320362356_The_trade-off_between_morphology_and_control_in_the_co-optimized_design_of_robots","310329157_Exploration_A_Study_of_Count-Based_Exploration_for_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","305517096_Holes_stabilize_freely_falling_coins","337602058_A_robotic_Intelligent_Towing_Tank_for_learning_complex_fluid-structure_dynamics","324402303_Robot-scientists_will_lead_tomorrow's_biomaterials_discovery","322607419_Model-Free_Design_Optimization_of_a_Hopping_Robot_and_Its_Comparison_With_a_Human_Designer","317005986_Evolutionary_Developmental_Robotics_Improving_Morphology_and_Control_of_Physical_Robots","312972605_On_a_particular_case_of_the_descent_of_a_heavy_body_in_a_resisting_medium","304145990_The_behavior_of_large_particles_falling_in_quiescent_liquids","303992986_Optimization_Methods_for_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning","303822096_Unifying_Count-Based_Exploration_and_Intrinsic_Motivation","281768572_Discovering_governing_equations_from_data_Sparse_identification_of_nonlinear_dynamical_systems","301233046_Introduction_to_Nonlinear_Science","285679030_Numerical_study_of_the_unsteady_aerodynamics_of_freely_falling_plates"]}
