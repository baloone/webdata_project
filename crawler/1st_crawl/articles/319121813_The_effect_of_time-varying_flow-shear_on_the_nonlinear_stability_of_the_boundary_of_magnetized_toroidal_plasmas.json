{"id":"319121813_The_effect_of_time-varying_flow-shear_on_the_nonlinear_stability_of_the_boundary_of_magnetized_toroidal_plasmas","abstract":"We show, with the help of a generalized Ginzburg-Landau model, that the time-varying perpendicular sheared flow is crucial to the dynamics of fluid instabilities observed in the boundary of toroidal magnetized high-temperature plasmas. The model reproduces key dynamical features of the boundary instabilities (called edge-localized modes) including quasi-steady states, mode transitions, and rapid relaxation. More precisely, we consider two cases for the model: single mode and coupled modes. Including the time-varying shear strength, we show that it is possible to reproduce quasi-steady states for the single mode and mode transitions for the coupled partial differential equations, respectively.","authors":["Youngmin Oh","Hyung Ju Hwang","Michael Leconte","Gunsu S.
