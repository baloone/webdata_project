{"id":"304537483_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","abstract":"A rerouting sequence is a sequence of shortest -paths such that consecutive paths differ in one vertex. We study the Shortest Path Rerouting Problem, which asks, given two shortest -paths and in a graph , whether a rerouting sequence exists from to . This problem is PSPACE-hard in general, but we show that it can be solved in polynomial time if is planar. In addition, it can be solved in polynomial time when every vertex has at most two neighbors closer to and at most two neighbors closer to . To this end, we introduce a dynamic programming method for reconfiguration problems, based on using small encodings of reconfiguration graphs.","authors":["Paul Bonsma"],"meta":["June 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 231(5â€“6)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2016.05.024"],"references":["276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","273158401_The_Complexity_of_Dominating_Set_Reconfiguration","272521478_Reconfiguration_on_Sparse_Graphs","262264509_Reconfiguration_over_Tree_Decompositions","261673053_Shortest_Reconfiguration_Paths_in_the_Solution_Space_of_Boolean_Formulas","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","221543279_Sorting_with_Complete_Networks_of_Stacks","220770584_Solutions_to_Real-World_Instances_of_PSPACE-Complete_Stacking","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220194396_Connectedness_of_the_graph_of_vertex-colourings","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","320047136_Shortest_Reconfiguration_Paths_in_the_Solution_Space_of_Boolean_Formulas","307947435_The_complexity_of_dominating_set_reconfiguration","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","282844715_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs_and_their_Generalizations","264963171_The_height_and_length_of_colour_switching","264005478_The_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_for_Bounded_Pathwidth_Graphs","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","235601904_Recoloring_bounded_treewidth_graphs","226472035_Reconfiguration_of_List_Edge-Colorings_in_a_Graph","224836520_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","222548494_PSPACE-Completeness_of_Sliding-Block_Puzzles_and_Other_Problems_through_the_Nondeterministic_Constraint_Logic_Model_of_Computation","221543845_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220994909_Motion_Planning_with_Pulley_Rope_and_Baskets","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148404_Shortest_paths_between_shortest_paths","46585526_The_Complexity_of_Rerouting_Shortest_Paths","2527856_Dynamic_Programming_On_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth"]}
