{"id":"337612906_Predicting_the_Long-term_Outcomes_of_Biologics_in_Psoriasis_Patients_using_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Despite the vast amount of data on the efficacy of biologics in psoriasis treatment, therapeutic decision‐making is still based on a trial‐and‐error approach. In a real world setting over 50% of patients needing dose adjustment during therapy and 20‐50% of patients experiencing a relapse of the disease requiring a switch to another medication.","authors":["Sepideh Emam","A.X.
