{"id":"228570328_Continuous_frames_in_Hilbert_spaces","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a mean of a continuous frame which is a generalization of discrete frames. Since a discrete frame is a special case of these frames, we expect that some of the results that occur in the frame theory will be generalized to these frames. For such a generalization, after giving some basic results and theorems about these frames, we discuss the following: dual to these frames, perturbation of continuous frames and robustness of these frames to an erasure of some elements.","authors":["Asghar Rahimi","Abbas Najati","And Y N Dehghan"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","250719886_Generalized_frames_and_their_redundancy","288921766_Continuous_frames_on_Julia_sets","276268823_Theory_of_Communication","265368685_Coherent_States-Wavelets_and_Their_Generalizations","248557437_Frames_containing_a_Riesz_basis_and_approximation_of_the_frame_coe_cients_using_nite_dimensional_methods","244456109_Frames_Associated_with_Measurable_Spaces","239284539_Frames_Containing_a_Riesz_Basis_and_Approximation_of_the_Frame_Coefficients_Using_Finite-Dimensional_Methods","228765624_An_Introduction_to_Wavelets","225469605_Perturbation_of_Operators_and_Applications_to_Frame_Theory"]}
