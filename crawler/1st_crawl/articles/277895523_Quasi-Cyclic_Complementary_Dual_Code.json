{"id":"277895523_Quasi-Cyclic_Complementary_Dual_Code","abstract":"LCD codes are linear codes that intersect with their dual trivially. Quasi\ncyclic codes that are LCD are characterized and studied by using their\nconcatenated structure. Some asymptotic results are derived. Hermitian LCD\ncodes are introduced to that end and their cyclic subclass is characterized.\nConstructions of QCCD codes from codes over larger alphabets are given.","authors":["Cem Güneri","Buket Özkaya","Patrick Solé"],"meta":["June 2015Finite Fields and Their Applications 42:67-80","DOI:10.1016/j.ffa.2016.07.005","SourcearXiv","Project: LCD codes"],"references":["296687034_Complementary_Dual_Codes_for_Counter-Measures_to_Side-Channel_Attacks","3080523_On_the_algebraic_structure_of_quasi-cyclic_codes_I_Finite_fields","3078820_Algebraic-Geometric_Codes_and_Multidimensional_Cyclic_Codes_A_Unified_Theory_and_Algorithms_for_Decoding_Using_Grbner_Bases","2822436_On_the_Dimension_of_the_Hull","266532070_A_Bound_on_the_Minimum_Distance_of_Quasi-cyclic_Codes","260302742_The_Concatenated_Structure_of_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_and_an_Improvement_of_Jensen's_Bound","256158228_The_condition_for_a_cyclic_code_to_have_a_complementary_dual","223063864_Multidimensional_cyclic_codes_and_Artin-Schreier_type_hypersurfaces_over_finite_fields","222484919_Linear_codes_with_complementary_duals","220618152_Factorization_of_Symmetric_Matrices_and_Trace-Orthogonal_Bases_in_Finite_Fields","220301316_A_Relation_Between_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_and_2-D_Cyclic_Codes","220301260_On_complementary-dual_quasi-cyclic_codes","220247409_Reversible_Codes","220188089_Linear_codes_with_complementary_duals_meet_the_Gilbert-Varshamov_bound","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language","3085500_On_the_Algebraic_Structure_of_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_III_Generator_Theory","3084248_The_Concatenated_Structure_of_Cyclic_and_Abelian_Codes"]}
