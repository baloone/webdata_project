{"id":"222467774_On_the_Theories_of_Triangular_Sets","abstract":"Different notions of triangular sets are presented. The relationship between these notions are studied. The main result is that four different existing notions of good triangular sets are equivalent.","authors":["Philippe Aubry","Daniel Lazard","Marc Moreno Maza"],"meta":["July 1999Journal of Symbolic Computation 28(1-2):105-124","DOI:10.1006/jsco.1999.0269","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220806333_Ritt-Wu's_Decomposition_Algorithm_and_Geometry_Theorem_Proving","220266652_Computations_with_Parametric_Equations","41106961_Representation_for_the_radical_of_a_finitely_generated_differential_ideal","316518690_Wu-Ritt_characteristic_sets_and_their_complexity","285022943_A_zero_structure_theorem_for_polynomial_equations_solving","285000921_Some_Recent_Advances_in_Mechanical_Theorem-Proving_of_Geometries","265876500_Searching_dependency_between_algebraic_equations_An_algorithm_applied_to_automated_reasoning","265537275_On_the_dimension_of_an_arbitrary_ascending_chain","265365578_On_zeros_of_algebraic_equations_-_An_application_of_Ritt_principle","243772553_An_implementation_of_the_characteristic_set_method_in_MAPLE","243530434_Systems_of_algebraic_equations_algorithms_and_complexity","222738684_Solving_zero-dimensional_algebraic_systems","222604610_A_Generalized_Euclidean_Algorithm_for_Computing_Triangular_Representations_of_Algebraic_Varieties","222304991_Triangular_Sets_for_Solving_Polynomial_Systems_a_Comparative_Implementation_of_Four_Methods","222266471_A_new_method_for_solving_algebraic_systems_of_positive_dimension","221420467_Polynomial_Gcd_Computations_over_Towers_of_Algebraic_Extensions","220162120_An_Elimination_Method_for_Polynomial_Systems","220161779_Decomposing_Polynomial_Systems_into_Simple_Systems","220160667_Algorithmic_Properties_of_Polynomial_Rings","200019149_Basic_Principles_of_Mechanical_Theorem_Proving_in_Elementary_Geometries","200019113_On_Wu's_Method_for_Solving_Systems_of_Algebraic_Equations","200018952_Differential_Algebra","200018470_Ideals_Varieties_and_Algorithms","2823431_Wu-Ritt_Characteristic_Sets_and_Their_Complexity","2819784_Efficient_Algorithms_and_Bounds_for_Wu-Ritt_Characteristic_Sets"]}
