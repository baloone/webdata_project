{"id":"222521501_On_the_descriptional_complexity_of_Watson-Crick_automata","abstract":"Watson–Crick automata are finite state automata working on double-stranded tapes, introduced to investigate the potential of DNA molecules for computing. In this paper, we continue the investigation of descriptional complexity of Watson–Crick automata initiated by Păun et al. [A. Păun, M. Păun, State and transition complexity of Watson–Crick finite automata, in: G. Ciobanu, G. Paun (Eds.), Fundamentals of Computation Theory, FCT’99, in: LNCS, vol. 1684, 1999, pp. 409–420]. In particular, we show that any finite language, as well as any unary regular language, can be recognized by a Watson–Crick automaton with only two, and respectively three, states. Also, we formally define the notion of determinism for these systems. Contrary to the case of non-deterministic Watson–Crick automata, we show that, for deterministic ones, the complementarity relation plays a major role in the acceptance power of these systems.","authors":["Elena Czeizler","Eugen Czeizler","Lila Kari","Kai Salomaa"],"meta":["August 2009Theoretical Computer Science 410(35):3250-3260","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2009.05.001","SourceOAI"],"references":["285351535_Codes","221467475_Watson-crick_automata_Determinism_and_state_complexity","221150055_State_and_Transition_Complexity_of_Watson-Crick_Finite_Automata","31596781_A_Short_Survey_on_Watson-Crick_Automata","5498861_Kemp_elimination_catalysts_by_computational_enzyme_design","268869815_Watson-Crick_o-automata","268312295_Computational_Complexity","253961257_Bringing_DNA_computers_to_life","234829070_On_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","222336827_On_partially_blind_multihead_finite_automata","221212491_The_Role_of_the_Complementarity_Relation_in_Watson-Crick_Automata_and_Sticker_Systems","220530431_State_Complexity_of_Finite_and_Infinite_Regular_Languages","220520552_Descriptional_Complexity_of_Finite_Automata_Concepts_and_Open_Problems","31596530_Watson_Crick_omega-automata","31593279_Watson-Crick_finite_automata","7074146_Tapping_the_computing_power_of_biological_molecules_gives_rise_to_tiny_machines_that_can_speak_directly_to_living_cells","2622982_State_and_Transition_Complexity_of_Watson-Crick_Finite_Automata"]}
