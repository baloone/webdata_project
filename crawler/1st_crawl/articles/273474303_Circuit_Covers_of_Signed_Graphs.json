{"id":"273474303_Circuit_Covers_of_Signed_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce the concept of a signed circuit cover of a signed graph. A signed circuit cover is a natural analog of a circuit cover of a graph and is equivalent to a covering of the corresponding signed graphic matroid with circuits. As in the case of graphs, a signed graph has a signed circuit cover only when it admits a nowhere-zero integer flow. In the present article, we establish the existence of a universal coefficient such that every signed graph G that admits a nowhere-zero integer flow has a signed circuit cover of total length at most . We show that if G is bridgeless, then , and in the general case .","authors":["Edita Mácajová","André Raspaud","Edita Rollová","Martin Škoviera"],"meta":["March 2015Journal of Graph Theory 81(2)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.21866"],"references":["266354500_Graphs_with_the_Circuit_Cover_Property","264623884_Nowhere-Zero_Flows_on_Signed_Eulerian_Graphs","264123002_Characteristic_flows_on_signed_graphs_and_short_circuit_covers","238127875_Orientation_of_Signed_Graphs","223112560_Signed_graph_coloring","220898525_Covering_a_Graph_by_Circuits","303658133_Graphs_with_the_circuit_cover_property","285899345_On_the_notion_of_balance_of_signed_graph","265373928_Nowhere-zero_flow_problems","250956239_Covering_Multigraphs_by_Simple_Circuits","242793474_Signed_graphs_To_T_Zaslausky_Discrete_Appl_Math_4_1982_47-74","232346487_Signed_graphs","229694418_Orientation_embedding_of_signed_graphs","228705395_Flows_on_bidirected_graphs","225838050_Flows_in_3-edge-connected_bidirected_graphs","223372390_Characterization_of_the_maximum_genus_of_a_signed_graph","223141062_Nowhere-zero_integral_flows_on_a_bidirected_graph","222601671_Shortest_covering_of_graphs_with_cycles","222387707_Nowhere-zero_integral_chains_and_flows_in_bidirected_graphs","222361007_Flows_and_generalized_Coloring_Theorems_in_graphs","222286750_Short_cycle_covers_and_the_cycle_double_cover_conjecture","220617351_Covering_Graphs_by_Simple_Circuits","220548953_Short_Cycle_Covers_of_Graphs_and_Nowhere-Zero_Flows","220186605_On_flows_in_bidirected_graphs","220078614_Proofs_of_Two_Minimum_Circuit_Cover_Conjectures","220075263_Circular_flow_on_signed_graphs","38322649_On_the_Notion_of_Balance_of_a_Signed_Graph","30516115_Flots_et_couvertures_par_des_cycles_dans_les_graphes_et_les_matroides_These_de_3eme_cycle"]}
