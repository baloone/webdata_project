{"id":"266988884_On_some_metric_properties_of_the_Sierpinski_graphs_Snk","abstract":"Sierpiński graphs S(n,k), n,k∈ℕ, can be interpreted as graphs of a variant of the tower of Hanoi with k≥3 pegs and n≥1 discs. In particular, it has been proved that, for k=3, the graphs S(n,3) are isomorphic to the Hanoi graphs H 3 n . In this paper, the chromatic number, the diameter, the eccentricity of a vertex, the radius and the centre of S(n,k) are determined. Moreover, an important invariant and a number-theoretical characterization of S(n,k) are derived. By means of these results, the complexity of Problem 1, that is the complexity to get from an arbitrary vertex v∈S(n,k) to the nearest and to the most distant extreme vertex, are given. For the Hanoi graphs H 3 n , some of these results are new.","authors":["Daniele Parisse"],"meta":["January 2009Ars Combinatoria -Waterloo then Winnipeg- 90"],"references":["285889619_Completeness_of_the_Lipscomb_space","284698156_On_the_residue_of_a_binomial-theorem_coefficient_with_respect_to_a_prime_modulus","268613709_Lipscomb's_LA_Space_Fractalized_in_Hilbert's_l_2_A_Space","243078273_On_Imbedding_Finite-Dimensional_Metric_Spaces","220110521_A_Probabilistic_Analysis_of_an_Error-Correcting_Algorithm_for_the_Towers_of_Hanoi_Puzzle"]}
