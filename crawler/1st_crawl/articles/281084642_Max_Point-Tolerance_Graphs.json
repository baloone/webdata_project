{"id":"281084642_Max_Point-Tolerance_Graphs","abstract":"A graph $G$ is a \\emph{max point-tolerance (MPT)} graph if each vertex $v$ of\n$G$ can be mapped to a \\emph{pointed-interval} $(I_v, p_v)$ where $I_v$ is an\ninterval of $\\mathbb{R}$ and $p_v \\in I_v$ such that $uv$ is an edge of $G$ iff\n$I_u \\cap I_v \\supseteq \\{p_u, p_v\\}$. MPT graphs model relationships among DNA\nfragments in genome-wide association studies as well as basic transmission\nproblems in telecommunications. We formally introduce this graph class,\ncharacterize it, study combinatorial optimization problems on it, and relate it\nto several well known graph classes. We characterize MPT graphs as a special\ncase of several 2D geometric intersection graphs; namely, triangle, rectangle,\nL-shape, and line segment intersection graphs. We further characterize MPT as\nhaving certain linear orders on their vertex set. Our last characterization is\nthat MPT graphs are precisely obtained by intersecting special pairs of\ninterval graphs. We also show that, on MPT graphs, the maximum weight\nindependent set problem can be solved in polynomial time, the coloring problem\nis NP-complete, and the clique cover problem has a 2-approximation. Finally, we\ndemonstrate several connections to known graph classes; e.g., MPT graphs\nstrictly contain interval graphs and outerplanar graphs, but are incomparable\nto permutation, chordal, and planar graphs.","authors":["Daniele Catanzaro","Steven Chaplick","Stefan Felsner","Bjarni V Halld√≥rsson"],"meta":["August 2015Discrete Applied Mathematics 216(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2015.08.019","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281657852_p-BOX_A_new_graph_model","259135786_Approximating_hitting_sets_of_axis-parallel_rectangles_intersecting_a_monotone_curve","256766504_Planar_graphs_as_VPG-graphs","236009981_Planar_graphs_as_VPG-Graphs","235784799_Equilateral_L-Contact_Graphs","233724034_An_Integer_Programming_Formulation_of_the_Parsimonious_Loss_of_Heterozygosity_Problem","231337868_Combinatorial_and_Geometric_Properties_of_Planar_Laman_Graphs","230596115_Efficient_Vertex-_and_Edge-Coloring_of_Outerplanar_Graphs","220639625_Vertex_Intersection_Graphs_of_Paths_on_a_Grid","50347202_The_Clark_Phaseable_Sample_Size_Problem_Long-Range_Phasing_and_Loss_of_Heterozygosity_in_GWAS","316799542_Geometric_Graphs_and_Arrangements","268614802_On_powers_of_interval_and_unit_interval_graphs","266010311_INDEPENDENT_SET_and_CLIQUE_problems_in_intersection-defined_classes_of_graphs","265444422_The_Complexity_of_Coloring_Circular_Arcs_and_Chords","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","260490196_Independent_and_Hitting_Sets_of_Rectangles_Intersecting_a_Diagonal_Line_Algorithms_and_Complexity","257069080_Independent_and_Hitting_Sets_of_Rectangles_Intersecting_a_Diagonal_Line","257048084_Coloring_Relatives_of_Intervals_on_the_Plane_I_Chromatic_Number_Versus_Girth","244448656_A_generalization_of_interval_graphs_with_tolerances","243777916_Some_polynomial_algorithms_for_certain_graphs_and_hypergraphs","240500205_Tolerance_graphs_Cambridge_Studies_in_Advanced_Mathemat_-_ics","239059987_Interval_Orders_and_Interval_Graphs_-_A_Study_of_Partially_Ordered_Sets","235219139_Asymmetric_Uplink-Downlink_Assignment_for_Energy-Efficient_Mobile_Communication_Systems","230596032_Representation_of_a_Finite_Graph_by_a_Set_of_Intervals_on_the_Real_Line","230595977_A_recognition_algorithm_for_the_intersection_graph_of_paths_in_a_tree","230595911_Extensions_of_permutation_and_interval_graphs","229750144_On_the_homogeneous_representation_of_interval_graphs","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227731834_A_digraph_represented_by_family_of_boxes_or_spheres","226975828_Linear-Time_Recognition_of_Circular-Arc_Graphs","225125495_On_rigid_circuit_graphs","223928535_A_recognition_algorithm_for_the_intersection_graph_of_directed_paths_in_directed_trees","223393468_Finding_the_connected_component_and_a_maximum_clique_of_an_intersection_graph_of_rectangles_in_the_plane","223145998_A_weighted_min-max_relation_for_intervals","222804892_A_characterization_of_interval_catch_digraphs","222707724_On_orthogonal_ray_graphs","222614160_An_optimal_greedy_heuristic_to_color_interval_graphs","222545054_Approximating_the_minimum_clique_cover_and_other_hard_problems_in_subtree_filament_graphs","222370980_Intersection_graphs_of_curves_in_the_plane","222187124_Linear_time_algorithms_on_circular-arc_graphs","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","221462793_Coloring_and_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Rectangles","220780018_Max-Tolerance_Graphs_as_Intersection_Graphs_Cliques_Cycles_and_Recognition","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220570175_Algorithms_for_Interval_Catch_Digraphs","220532808_Domination_on_Cocomparability_Graphs","220186609_Characterization_of_the_graphs_with_boxicity_2","220114671_Linear_Algorithms_to_Recognize_Outerplanar_and_Maximal_Outerplanar_Graphs","220113547_Optimal_Packing_and_Covering_in_the_Plane_are_NP-Complete","220111925_A_Unified_Approach_to_Domination_Problems_on_Interval_Graphs","46706018_Large_recurrent_microdeletions_associated_with_schizophrenia_Nature","44329868_Algorithmic_graph_theory_and_perfect_graphs_Martin_Charles_Golumbic","41710669_Clique_partitioning_of_interval_graphs_with_submodular_costs_on_the_cliques","38346920_Incidence_Matrices_and_Interval_Graphs","35276411_Representations_of_indifference_relations"]}
