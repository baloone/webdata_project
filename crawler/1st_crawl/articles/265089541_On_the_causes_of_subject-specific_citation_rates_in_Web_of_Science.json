{"id":"265089541_On_the_causes_of_subject-specific_citation_rates_in_Web_of_Science","abstract":"It is well known in bibliometrics that the average number of citations per\npaper differs greatly between the various disciplines. The differing citation\nculture (in particular the different average number of references per paper and\nthereby the different probability of being cited) is widely seen as the cause\nof this variation. Based on all Web of Science (WoS) records published in 1990,\n1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 we demonstrate that almost all disciplines show\nsimilar numbers of references in the appendices of their papers. Our results\nsuggest that the average citation rate is far more influenced by the extent to\nwhich the papers (cited as references) are included in WoS as linked database\nrecords. For example, the comparatively low citation rates in the humanities\nare not at all the result of a lower average number of references per paper but\nare caused by the low fraction of linked references which refer to papers\npublished in the core journals covered by WoS.","authors":["Werner Marx","Lutz Bornmann"],"meta":["August 2014Scientometrics 102(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-014-1499-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262556738_Chapter_1_MEASURING_SCIENCE_CAPITA_SELECTA_OF_CURRENT_MAIN_ISSUES","235251464_What_do_citation_counts_measure_A_review_of_studies_on_citing_behavior_J_Doc_64145-80_DOI_10110800220410810844150","46441527_Differences_in_Impact_Factor_Across_Fields_and_Over_Time","321877961_Citation_Analysis_in_Research_Evaluation","269660146_Citation_Indexing-Its_Theory_and_Application_in_Science_Technology_and_Humanities","227778658_The_Publication_and_Citation_Impact_Profiles_of_Angewandte_Chemie_and_the_Journal_of_the_American_Chemical_Society_Based_on_the_Sections_of_Chemical_Abstracts_A_Case_Study_on_the_Limitations_of_the_Jo","220433288_The_publication_and_citation_impact_profiles_of","220195733_What_lies_behind_the_average_and_significance_of_citation_indicators_in_different_disciplines","44535015_Citation_indexing-its_theory_and_application_in_sciences_technology_and_humanities_Eugene_Garfield","1920105_Differences_in_Impact_Factor_Across_Fields_and_Over_Time"]}
