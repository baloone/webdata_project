{"id":"225194195_The_Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_AIA_on_the_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_SDO","abstract":"The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides multiple simultaneous high-resolution full-disk images of the corona and transition region up to 0.5R\n⊙ above the solar limb with 1.5-arcsec spatial resolution and 12-second temporal resolution. The AIA consists of four telescopes\nthat employ normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics to provide narrow-band imaging of seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band\npasses centered on specific lines: Fe xviii (94Å), Fe viii, xxi (131Å), Fe ix (171Å), Fe xii, xxiv (193Å), Fe xiv (211Å), He ii (304Å), and Fe xvi (335Å). One telescope observes C iv (near 1600Å) and the nearby continuum (1700Å) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with\nimages from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6×104K to 2×107K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010. AIA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of solar variability and of how the\nSun’s energy is stored and released into the heliosphere and geospace.\n\nKeywordsSolar corona–Solar instrumentation–Solar imaging–Extreme ultraviolet","authors":["James R.
