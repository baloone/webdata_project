{"id":"339362503_The_2019_WHO_classification_of_tumours_of_the_breast","abstract":"The newly published World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the breast features significant changes compared to earlier editions. In this review, we outline the major changes in this important reference source for those diagnosing tumours, or engaged in cancer research, and describe the significant changes. For breast cancer, the overview acknowledges the treatment‐relevant subtypes of invasive carcinoma (based on ER and HER2 status) and new data is added to support the differences in pathogenesis, treatment response and prognosis of these clinically relevant groupings. The WHO Classification of Tumours is increasingly evidence‐based, with a clear update cycle, improved quality of illustrations, as well as content, led by an editorial board comprising pathologists, but increasingly incorporating input from other disciplines. The advent of the new website allows the use of whole slide images, and hyperlinks to evidence or external bodies that produce guidance on staging or reporting.","authors":["Puay Hoon Tan","Ian Ellis","Kimberly H Allison","Edi Brogi"],"meta":["February 2020Histopathology 77(2)","DOI:10.1111/his.14091","Project: Tumour classification"],"references":["327191958_A_common_classification_framework_for_neuroendocrine_neoplasms_an_International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer_IARC_and_World_Health_Organization_WHO_expert_consensus_proposal","324127516_Solid_Papillary_Breast_Carcinomas_Resembling_the_Tall_Cell_Variant_of_Papillary_Thyroid_Neoplasms_Solid_Papillary_Carcinomas_with_Reverse_Polarity_Harbor_Recurrent_Mutations_Affecting_IDH2_and_PIK3CA_","262534195_Papillary_and_neuroendocrine_breast_lesions_The_WHO_stance"]}
