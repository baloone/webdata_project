{"id":"285895867_Hydro_power_energy_resources_in_Nigeria","abstract":"Energy is one commodity on which the provision of goods and services depend. Its availability and consumption rate is an economic index to measure the development of any community. In Nigeria, there is a limitation to power supply from the National grid which has adversely affected the economic and social development of the populace. This really necessitates the need for decentralized power source as a viable alternative to which hydro power schemes readily fits in. Major rivers and dam's development provide an enviable energy potential for the exploitation of hydro energy in Nigeria. This study presents analysis of hydro power as renewable energy resource potentials in Nigeria with the status of the database including its adequacy and gaps. A detailed analysis of the technical and technological assessment, present demand and supply situation is also made.","authors":["Krishpersad Manohar","Anthony A.
