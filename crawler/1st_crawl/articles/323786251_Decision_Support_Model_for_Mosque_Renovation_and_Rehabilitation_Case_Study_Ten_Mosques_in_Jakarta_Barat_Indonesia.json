{"id":"323786251_Decision_Support_Model_for_Mosque_Renovation_and_Rehabilitation_Case_Study_Ten_Mosques_in_Jakarta_Barat_Indonesia","abstract":"Mosque, for Muslim, is not only a place for daily worshipping, however as a center of culture as well. It is an important and valuable building to be well managed. For a responsible department or institution (such as Religion or Plan Department in Indonesia), to practically manage a lot of mosques is not simple task to handle. The challenge is in relation to data number and characteristic problems tackled. Specifically for renovating and rehabilitating the damaged mosques, a decision to determine the first damaged mosque priority to be renovated and rehabilitated is problematic. Through two types of optimization method, simulated-annealing and hill-climbing, a decision support model for mosque renovation and rehabilitation was systematically constructed. The method fuzzy-logic was also operated to establish the priority of eleven selected parameters. The constructed model is able to simulate an efficiency comparison between two optimization methods used and suggest the most objective decision coming from 196 generated alternatives.","authors":["Ditdit Nugeraha Utama","Yaya Sudarya Triana","Maulana Muhammad Iqbal","M Iksal"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 978(1):012057","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/978/1/012057","Project: ecoDSS for Intelligent Village and City"],"references":["343648607_The_Optimization_of_the_3-d_Structure_of_Plants_Using_Functional-Structural_Plant_Models_Case_Study_of_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_in_Indonesia","309891866_Defining_Issue_of_Thermal_Comfort_Control_through_Urban_Mosque_Facade_Design","303940922_The_Use_of_Fuzzy_Alpha_Cut_to_Improve_the_Forecasting_Range_Results_of_the_ARIMA_Model_Assist_Decision_Making_Process","303391702_Implications_of_Stereotype_Mosque_Architecture_on_Sustainability","286530488_The_Civic_and_Cultural_Role_of_the_Sheikh_Zayed_Grand_Mosque","285815372_Communal_Mosques_Design_Functionality_Towards_the_Development_of_Sustainability_for_Community","275540865_Impact_of_Hot_and_Arid_Climate_on_Architecture_Case_Study_Varzaneh_Jame_Mosque","271865079_The_Importance_of_Islamic_Art_in_Mosque_Interior","283426774_A_multi-criteria_decision_support_model_for_evaluating_the_performance_of_partnerships","279958039_Artificial_Intelligence"]}
