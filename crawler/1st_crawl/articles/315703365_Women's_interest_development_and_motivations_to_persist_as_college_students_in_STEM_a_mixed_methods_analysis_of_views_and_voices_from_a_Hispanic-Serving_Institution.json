A review of the literature regarding interest development and motivation as related to women as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learners in diverse communities is presented. The goal of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences women credited for influencing the development of their career interest goals and the sources of motivation they attribute to success in their academic course outcomes in their fields of study.","authors":["Kimberly Grau Talley","Araceli Martinez Ortiz"],"meta":["March 2017International Journal of STEM Education 4(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40594-017-0059-2"],"references":["292547534_Bridging_Cultural_and_Developmental_Approaches_to_Psychology_New_Syntheses_in_Theory_Research_and_Policy","346606347_Editor's_Commentary_Defining_Retention","345983962_Falling_Behind_Boom_Bust_and_the_Global_Race_for_Scientific_Talent","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","313713893_Interest_and_learning_from_text","306199590_Research_and_practice_of_student_retention_What_next_Journal_of_College_Student_Retention_Research","305389482_Focus_Groups_A_Practical_Guide_for_Applied_Research","297095776_BEHAVIORALLY_BASED_MASCULINE_AND_FEMININE_ACTIVITY_PREFERENCE_SCALES_FOR_PRESCHOOLERS_-_CORRELATES_WITH_OTHER_CLASSROOM_BEHAVIORS_AND_COGNITIVE_TESTS","292669919_Exploring_Faculty_Insights_Into_Why_Undergraduate_College_Students_Leave_STEM_Fields_of_Study-_A_Three-Part_Organizational_Self-Study","289848834_Impact_of_self-efficacy_on_interest_and_choice_in_engineering_study_and_careers_for_undergraduatewomen_engineering_students"]}
