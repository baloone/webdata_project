{"id":"309890140_A_meta-analysis_of_the_impact_of_technology_on_learning_effectiveness_of_elementary_students","abstract":"The existing studies suggest that if technology is interwoven comprehensively into pedagogy, it can act as a powerful tool for effective learning of the elementary students. This study conducted the meta-analysis by integrating the quantitative findings of 122 peer-reviewed academic papers that measured the impact of technology on learning effectiveness of elementary students. The results confirmed that the technology has a medium effect on learning effectiveness of elementary students. Further, this study analysed the effect sizes of moderating variables such as domain subject, application type, intervention duration, and learning environment. Finally, the impact of technology at different levels of moderating variables has been discussed and the implications for theory and practice are provided.","authors":["Sumedha
