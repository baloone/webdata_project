{"id":"8463904_Simple_swimmer_at_low_Reynolds_number_Three_linked_spheres","abstract":"A simple one-dimensional swimmer consisting of three spheres linked by rigid rods was proposed and its swimming velocity was calculated. A swimmer consist of three hard spheres that are linked through two arms. The new model are characterized by low reynolds number that measures the ratio between the inertial term and the viscous term in the hydrodynamical equation of motion. The advantage of this model are that the analysis of the hydrodynamics problem could be performed more easily and model swimmer could be used in making molecular-sized machines with controllable motion.","authors":["Ali Najafi","Ramin Golestanian"],"meta":["July 2004Physical Review E 69(6 Pt 1):062901","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.69.062901","SourcePubMed"],"references":["316735834_Low_Reynolds_number_hydrodynamics","256197412_An_Introduction_to_Fluid_Dynamic","253687264_A_note_on_swimming_using_internally_generated_traveling_waves","246797597_Mechanics_of_Swimming_and_Flying","244945756_An_Introduction_To_Fluid_Dynamics","243681363_Analysis_of_the_Swimming_of_Microscopic_Organisms","231982085_Brownian_Diffusion_of_Particles_With_Hydrodynamic_Interaction","231964231_On_self-propulsion_of_micro-machines_at_low_Reynolds_number_Purcell's_three-link_swimmer","229091490_Life_at_Low_Reynolds_Number","13899174_The_efficiency_of_propulsion_by_a_rotating_flagellum"]}
