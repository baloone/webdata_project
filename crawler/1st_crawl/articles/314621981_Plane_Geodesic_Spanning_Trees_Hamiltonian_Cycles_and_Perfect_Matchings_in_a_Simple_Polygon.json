{"id":"314621981_Plane_Geodesic_Spanning_Trees_Hamiltonian_Cycles_and_Perfect_Matchings_in_a_Simple_Polygon","abstract":"Let S be a finite set of points in the interior of a simple polygon P. A geodesic graph, \\(G_P(S,E)\\), is a graph with vertex set S and edge set E such that each edge \\((a,b)\\in E\\) is the shortest path between a and b inside P. \\(G_P\\) is said to be plane if the edges in E do not cross. If the points in S are colored, then \\(G_P\\) is said to be properly colored provided that, for each edge \\((a,b)\\in E\\), a and b have different colors. In this paper we consider the problem of computing (properly colored) plane geodesic perfect matchings, Hamiltonian cycles, and spanning trees of maximum degree three.","authors":["Ahmad Biniaz","Prosenjit Bose","Anil Maheshwari","Michiel Smid"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-28678-5_5","Conference: International Conference on Topics in Theoretical Computer Science"],"references":["256606254_Geodesic-Preserving_Polygon_Simplification","45072322_Edge-Removal_and_Non-Crossing_Configurations_in_Geometric_Graphs","300636388_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Plane_Matchings_in_Multipartite_Geometric_Graphs","297651875_Properly_Colored_Geometric_Matchings_and_3-Trees_Without_Crossings_on_Multicolored_Points_in_the_Plane","247699059_Computing_Geodesic_Properties_Inside_a_Simple_Polygon","228600739_Discrete_Geometry_on_Red_and_Blue_Points_in_the_Plane_-_A_Survey_-","221584433_On_the_Maximum_Degree_of_Bipartite_Embeddings_of_Trees_in_the_Plane","220618273_Optimal_Search_in_Planar_Subdivisions","220569305_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220223671_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Visibility_and_Shortest_Path_Problems_Inside_Triangulated_Simple_Polygons","34558743_Maximum_matchings_in_complete_multipartite_graphs","2907862_Geodesic_Ham-Sandwich_Cuts"]}
