{"id":"316284124_The_AES-256_Cryptosystem_Resists_Quantum_Attacks","abstract":"Privacy of information can be maintained using two cryptographic techniques i.e. symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography. For securing data using symmetric key cryptography, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the trusted cryptographic algorithms. AES is a block cipher based symmetric key cryptographic algorithm which can resist conventional computers as well as quantum computers. In recent years, many researches have been done that exploit the property of quantum mechanics to solve mathematical problems that are ever difficult for conventional computers. Many of the cryptographic algorithms can be broken if large scale quantum computers are ever made. This paper depicts the proof of AES-256 using Grover's algorithm which can resist quantum.","authors":["Sandeep Rao","Dindayal Mahto","DILIP KUMAR YADAV","Danish Ali Khan"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Advanced Computer Research 8(3):404-408"],"references":["312190500_A_Survey_on_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","308208673_Security_Analysis_of_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_and_RSA","283117937_Quantum_Cryptography_Beyond_Quantum_Key_Distribution","278782992_Security_Improvement_of_One-Time_Password_Using_Crypto-Biometric_Model","273920359_Enhancing_Security_of_One-Time_Password_Using_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_with_Finger-Print_Biometric","273918366_Enhancing_security_of_one-time_password_using_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_with_biometrics_for_e-commerce_applications","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","312147834_NIST_Report_on_Post-Quantum_Cryptography","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","241466442_From_Schrodinger's_equation_to_the_quantum_search_algorithm"]}
