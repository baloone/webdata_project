{"id":"336819042_Nonlinear_Causal_Link_Estimation_Under_Hidden_Confounding_with_an_Application_to_Time_Series_Anomaly_Detection","abstract":"Causality analysis represents one of the most important tasks when examining dynamical systems such as ecological time series. We propose to mitigate the problem of inferring nonlinear cause-effect dependencies in the presence of a hidden confounder by using deep learning with domain knowledge integration. Moreover, we suggest a time series anomaly detection approach using causal link intensity increase as an indicator of the anomaly. Our proposed method is based on the Causal Effect Variational Autoencoder (CEVAE) which we extend and apply to anomaly detection in time series. We evaluate our method on synthetic data having properties of ecological time series and compare to the vector autoregressive Granger causality (VAR-GC) baseline.","authors":["Violeta Teodora Trifunov","Maha Shadaydeh","Jakob Runge","Veronika Eyring"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-33676-9_18","In book: Pattern Recognition (pp.261-273)","Project: Deep graphical models"],"references":["336819520_Time-Frequency_Causal_Inference_Uncovers_Anomalous_Events_in_Environmental_Systems","330523197_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_in_Time_Series_Data_using_Deep_Learning","326598170_Causal_network_reconstruction_from_time_series_From_theoretical_assumptions_to_practical_estimation","324643715_Detecting_Regions_of_Maximal_Divergence_for_Spatio-Temporal_Anomaly_Detection","355989126_Estimating_individual_treatment_effect_Generalization_bounds_and_algorithms","335749219_Time-Frequency_Causal_Inference_Uncovers_Anomalous_Events_in_Environmental_Systems","331089977_Deep_learning_and_process_understanding_for_data-driven_Earth_system_science","329477144_The_Interpretation_of_Interaction_in_Contingency_Tables","326847690_Causality_analysis_of_ecological_time_series_a_time-frequency_approach","323164727_Neural_Relational_Inference_for_Interacting_Systems"]}
