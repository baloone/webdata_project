To examine this question, we describe a project based learning embedded system course that we have taught and identify which topics are covered in it compared to the IEEE/ACM recommendations. The major contention lies in the idea that students can access and use an open source community that is focused on getting things working as opposed to strictly looking at low-level technical aspects of embedded systems. Additionally, the presence of open source and reusable designs makes it difficult to identify what a student is doing. In our experience, using the Arduino exposes students to sufficient complexity and challenges for an embedded system course.","authors":["Peter Jamieson"],"meta":["April 2012"],"references":["277289974_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Teaching_Engineering_Design","263063836_Engineering_Design_Thinking_Teaching_and_Learning","234803702_Hands-on_oriented_curriculum_and_laboratory_development_for_embedded_system_design","234781248_The_Delft_MS_Curriculum_on_Embedded_Systems","228379484_Educational_Robotic_Platform_based_on_Arduino","221538928_Open_source_projects_in_programming_courses","221537808_Open_source_software_intellectual_challenges_to_the_status_quo","221516688_The_LilyPad_Arduino_Using_computational_textiles_to_investigate_engagement_aesthetics_and_diversity_in_computer_science_education","220707230_Building_a_framework_for_the_senior_capstone_experience_in_an_information_computer_technology_program","220094318_What_Is_Embedded_Systems_and_How_Should_It_Be_Taught-Results_from_a_Didactic_Analysis","38090858_Preparing_students_for_capstone_design_Senior_Design","3050934_A_Project-Based_Learning_Approach_to_Design_Electronic_Systems_Curricula","3050788_An_introductory_digital_design_course_using_a_low-cost_autonomous_robot","266316641_Processing_A_Programming_Handbook_for_Visual_Designers_and_Artists","234790521_Organizing_and_evaluating_course_on_embedded_programming","228391181_Nexos_A_next_generation_embedded_systems_laboratory","224207158_Lab_kits_using_the_Arduino_prototyping_platform","3923387_A_first_course_in_digital_design_using_VHDL_and_programmable_logic","2985645_Embedded_systems_education_for_the_future"]}
