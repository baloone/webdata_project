{"id":"328925048_Sphericity_and_Roundness_Computation_for_Particles_using_the_Extreme_Vertices_Model","abstract":"Shape is a property studied for many kinds of particles. Among shape parameters, sphericity and roundness indices had been largely studied to understand several processes. Some of these indices are based on length measurements of the particle obtained from its oriented bounding box (OBB). In this paper we follow a discrete approach based on Extreme Vertices Model and devise new methods to compute the OBB and the mentioned indices. We apply these methods to synthetic sedimentary rocks and to a real dataset of silicon nanocrystals (Si NC) to analyze the obtained results and compare them with those obtained with a classical voxel model.","authors":["Irving Cruz","Dolors Ayala","Daniel Hiller","Sebastian Gutsch"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Computational Science 30","DOI:10.1016/j.jocs.2018.11.005"],"references":["322113269_Determination_of_Shape_and_Sphericity_of_Silicon_Quantum_Dots_Imaged_by_EFTEM-Tomography","288918286_3D_quantitative_shape_analysis_on_form_roundness_and_compactness_with_mCT","281208362_An_Efficient_Alternative_to_Compute_the_Genus_of_Binary_Volume_Models","279449012_Traditional_soil_particle_sphericity_roundness_and_surface_roughness_by_computational_geometry","277653784_Quantifying_Morphology_of_Sands_Using_3D_Imaging","275648021_Micromorphology_characterization_and_reconstruction_of_sand_particles_using_micro_X-ray_tomography_and_spherical_harmonics","275260352_Observing_the_morphology_of_single-layered_embedded_silicon_nanocrystals_by_using_temperature-stable_TEM_membranes","267961527_EFFECT_OF_CUTTING_PARAMETERS_ON_THE_ROUNDNESS_OF_CYLINDRICAL_BARS_TURNED_OF_1018_STEEL","331892650_Nitrogen_at_theSi-nanocrystalSiO2interface_and_its_influence_on_luminescence_and_interface_defects","292211931_Two-dimensional_percolation_threshold_in_confined_Si_nanoparticle_networks"]}
