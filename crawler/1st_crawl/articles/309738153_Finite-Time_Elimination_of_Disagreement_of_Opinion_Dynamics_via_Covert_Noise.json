{"id":"309738153_Finite-Time_Elimination_of_Disagreement_of_Opinion_Dynamics_via_Covert_Noise","abstract":"Eliminating disagreement in a group is usually beneficial to the social stability. In this\npaper, using the well-known Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, we design a quite simple\nstrategy that could resolve the opinion difference of the system in finite time and induce the\nopinions synchronized to a targeted value. To be specific, we intentionally introduce weak\nrandom noise to only one agent to affect its opinion in the evolution and also a leader agent\nwith fixed opinion in a divisive group, then strictly prove that the disagreement is finally\neliminated and the opinions get synchronized to the leaderâ€™s opinion in finite time. Other\nthan that, we calculate the finite stopping time when the opinions synchronously reach the\nobjective opinion value, which could provide further guide for designing more efficient noise\nintervention strategy.","authors":["Wei Su","Ge Chen","Yongguang yu"],"meta":["November 2016IET Control Theory and Applications 12(4)","DOI:10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0918"],"references":["312153320_Mixing_beliefs_among_interacting_agents","281367392_Opinion_Dynamics_and_the_Evolution_of_Social_Power_in_Influence_Networks","276298294_The_Problem_of_Social_Control_and_Coordination_of_Complex_Systems_in_Sociology_A_Look_at_the_Community_Cleavage_Problem","345981480_Rationality_and_the_Analysis_of_International_Conflict","330436559_MANAGING_CONFLICT_IN_ORGANIZATIONS","329027305_A_discrete_nonlinear_and_non-autonomous_model_of_consensus_formation","321522705_Probability_Theory","315467637_Soft-control_for_collective_opinion_of_weighted_DeGroot_model","287249892_Noise_Leads_to_Quasi-Consensus_of_Hegselmann-Krause_Opinion_Dynamics","282987558_Fluctuation_analysis_of_a_long-range_opinion_dynamics"]}
