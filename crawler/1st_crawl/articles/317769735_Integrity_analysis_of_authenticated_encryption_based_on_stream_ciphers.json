{"id":"317769735_Integrity_analysis_of_authenticated_encryption_based_on_stream_ciphers","abstract":"We study the security of authenticated encryption based on a stream cipher and a universal hash function. We consider ChaCha20-Poly1305 and generic constructions proposed by Sarkar, where the generic constructions include 14 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) schemes and 3 DAEAD (deterministic AEAD) schemes. In this paper, we analyze the integrity of these schemes both in the standard INT-CTXT (integrity of ciphertext) notion and in the RUP (releasing unverified plaintext) setting called INT-RUP notion. We present INT-CTXT attacks against 3 out of the 14 AEAD schemes and 1 out of the 3 DAEAD schemes. We then show INT-RUP attacks against 1 out of the 14 AEAD schemes and the 2 remaining DAEAD schemes. Next, we consider ChaCha20-Poly1305 and show that it is provably secure in the INT-RUP notion. Finally, we show that the remaining 10 AEAD schemes are provably secure in the INT-RUP notion.","authors":["Kazuya Imamura","Kazuhiko Minematsu","Tetsu Iwata"],"meta":["October 2018International Journal of Information Security 17(3):1-19","DOI:10.1007/s10207-017-0378-9"],"references":["226167634_Authenticated_Encryption_Relations_among_Notions_and_Analysis_of_the_Generic_Composition_Paradigm","312710446_How_to_Securely_Release_Unverified_Plaintext_in_Authenticated_Encryption","266559218_Reconsidering_Generic_Composition","259636455_Modes_of_operations_for_encryption_and_authentication_using_stream_ciphers_supporting_an_initialisation_vector","243518911_Counter_with_cbc-mac_ccm","237128405_Encode-then-encipher_encryption_How_to_exploit_nonces_or_redundancy_in_plaintexts_for_efficient_encryption","229028741_ChaCha_a_variant_of_Salsa20","226841875_A_Provable-Security_Treatment_of_the_Key-Wrap_Problem","225181563_The_EAX_mode_of_operation","222080693_The_Security_of_the_Cipher_Block_Chaining_Message_Authentication_Code","221327027_Authenticated_Encryption_Relations_among_Notions_and_Analysis_of_the_Generic_Composition_Paradigm","221609935_Authenticated-encryption_with_associated-data","221355038_UMAC_Fast_and_Secure_Message_Authentication","221347851_The_Security_of_Triple_Encryption_and_a_Framework_for_Code-Based_Game-Playing_Proofs","221326911_Encode-Then-Encipher_Encryption_How_to_Exploit_Nonces_or_Redundancy_in_Plaintexts_for_Efficient_Cryptography"]}
