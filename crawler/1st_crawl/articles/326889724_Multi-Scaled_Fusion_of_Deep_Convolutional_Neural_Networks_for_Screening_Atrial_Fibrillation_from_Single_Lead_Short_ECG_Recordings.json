{"id":"326889724_Multi-Scaled_Fusion_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Screening_Atrial_Fibrillation_from_Single_Lead_Short_ECG_Recordings","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common sustained chronic cardiac arrhythmia in elderly population, associated with a high mortality and morbidity in stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease, systemic thromboembolism, etc. The early detection of AF is necessary for averting the possibility of disability or mortality. However, AF detection remains problematic due to its episodic pattern. In this paper, a multi-scaled fusion of deep convolutional neural network (MSCNN) is proposed to screen out AF recordings from single lead short ECG recordings. The MS-CNN employs the architecture of two-stream convolutional networks with different filter sizes to capture features of different scales. The experimental results show that the proposed MS-CNN achieves 96.99% of classification accuracy on ECG recordings cropped/padded to 5 seconds. Especially, the best classification accuracy, 98.13%, was is obtained on ECG recordings of 20 seconds. Compared with artificial neural network (ANN), shallow single-stream convolutional neural network (CNN), and VisualGeometry group network (VGGNet), the MS-CNN can achieve better classification performance. Meanwhile, visualization of the learned features from the MS-CNN demonstrates its superiority in extracting linear separable ECG features without hand-craft feature engineering. The excellent AF screening performance of the MS-CNN can satisfy most elders for daily monitoring with wearable devices.","authors":["Xiaomao Fan","Qihang Yao","Yunpeng Cai","Fen Miao"],"meta":["August 2018IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JBHI.2018.2858789"],"references":["321805775_On_the_performance_of_GoogLeNet_and_AlexNet_applied_to_sketches","317297097_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Learning_ECG_Features_for_Screening_Paroxysmal_Atrial_Fibrillation_Patients","277411157_Deep_Learning","277023475_High_Performance_Offline_Handwritten_Chinese_Character_Recognition_Using_GoogLeNet_and_Directional_Feature_Maps","272195367_Gated_Feedback_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","224807152_Guidelines_for_the_management_of_atrial_fibrillation_The_Task_Force_for_the_Management_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_of_the_European_Society_of_Cardiology_ESC","224807149_Guidelines_for_the_management_of_atrial_fibrillation_The_Task_Force_for_the_Management_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_of_the_European_Society_of_Cardiology_ESC","224375463_Detection_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_Using_Model-based_ECG_Analysis","220320677_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","50593697_A_Simple_Method_to_Detect_Atrial_Fibrillation_Using_RR_Intervals","26298520_Automatic_Real_Time_Detection_of_Atrial_Fibrillation","324046276_Rhythm_and_Quality_Classification_from_Short_ECGs_Recorded_using_a_Mobile_Device","324044679_AF_Detection_and_ECG_Classificationbased_on_Convolutional_Recurrent_Neural_Network","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319363302_Atrial_fibrillation_detection_by_multi-scale_convolutional_neural_networks","311610155_Convolutional_Two-Stream_Network_Fusion_for_Video_Action_Recognition","309708053_An_Extended_Bayesian_Framework_for_Atrial_and_Ventricular_Activity_Separation_in_Atrial_Fibrillation","308827673_High_performance_offline_handwritten_Chinese_character_recognition_using_GoogLeNet_and_directional_feature_maps","308152498_An_overview_of_gradient_descent_optimization_algorithms","301878129_Convolutional_Two-Stream_Network_Fusion_for_Video_Action_Recognition","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","281680408_Impact_of_the_presence_of_noise_on_RR_intervals-based_Atrial_Fibrillation_detection","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos","224202713_A_Novel_Method_for_Detection_of_the_Transition_Between_Atrial_Fibrillation_and_Sinus_Rhythm","221344937_On_Optimization_Methods_for_Deep_Learning","220658170_Detection_and_delineation_of_P_and_T_waves_in_12-lead_electrocardiograms","15076323_The_signal-averaged_P_wave_duration_A_rapid_and_noninvasive_marker_of_risk_of_atrial_fibrillation","10832777_On_the_momentum_term_in_gradient_descent_learning_algorithms","7520660_Prevention_of_Cardiovascular_Events_in_Elderly_People","3470211_Communication_In_The_Presence_Of_Noise"]}
