{"id":"280033985_Some_properties_of_skew_codes_over_finite_fields","abstract":"After recalling the definition of codes as modules over skew polynomial\nrings, whose multiplication is defined by using an automorphism and a\nderivation, and some basic facts about them, in the first part of this paper we\nstudy some of their main algebraic and geometric properties. Finally, for\nmodule skew codes constructed only with an automorphism, we give some BCH type\nlower bounds for their minimum distance.","authors":["Luis Felipe Tapia Cuiti√±o","Andrea Tironi"],"meta":["November 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 85(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0311-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267141678_sd-codes","257554963_Linear_codes_using_skew_polynomials_with_automorphisms_and_derivations","236274399_Sigma-Delta_Codes","230609710_Noncommutative_polynomial_maps","267334617_Free_Rings_and_their_Relations","266282029_Generalizations_of_the_BCH_bound","256206327_Vandermonde_and_Wronskian_matrices_over_division_rings","237053839_Dual_codes_of_product_semi-linear_codes","228830141_Constacyclic_codes_as_invariant_subspaces","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language"]}
