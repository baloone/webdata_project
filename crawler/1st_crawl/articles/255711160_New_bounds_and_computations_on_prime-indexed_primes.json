{"id":"255711160_New_bounds_and_computations_on_prime-indexed_primes","abstract":"In a 2009 article, K. A. Broughan and A. R. Barnett [J. Integer Seq. 12, No. 2, 10p. (2009; Zbl 1228.11010)] considered the set of prime-index primes. If the prime numbers are listed in increasing order (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,···), then the prime-index primes are those which occur in a prime-numbered position in the list (3,5,11,17,···). Barnett and Broughan established a prime-indexed prime number theorem analogous to the standard prime number theorem and gave an asymptotic for the size of the nth prime-indexed prime. The authors give explicit upper and lower bounds for π 2 (x), the number of prime-indexed primes up to x, as well as upper and lower bounds on the nth prime-indexed prime, all improvements on the bounds from 2009. We also prove analogous results for higher iterates of the sequence of primes. They present empirical results on large gaps between prime-index primes, the sum of inverses of the prime-index primes, and an analogue of Goldbach’s conjecture for prime-index primes.","authors":["Jonathan Bayless","Dominic Klyve","Tomás Oliveira e Silva"],"meta":["July 2013Integers 13:#A43"],"references":["267701160_Computing_px_the_combinatorial_method","245578016_Autour_de_la_fonction_qui_compte_le_nombre_de_nombres_premiers","242922074_Computing_px_The_Meissel-Lehmer_Method","268697176_On_Sums_of_Inverses_of_Primes","267166169_Empirical_verification_of_the_even_Goldbach_conjecture_and_computation_of_prime_gaps_up_to_410_18","266958056_Eine_Eigenschaft_der_Funktion_uber_die_Verteilung_der_Primzahlen","266198382_About_sequences_series_and_applications_in_prime_number_theory","245037116_The_segmented_sieve_of_eratosthenes_and_primes_in_arithmetic_progressions_to_10_12","243119663_On_Maximal_Gaps_between_Successive_Primes","242921508_Sharper_Bounds_for_the_Chebyshev_Functions_thx_and_psx_II"]}
