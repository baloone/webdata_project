{"id":"260282920_A_Few_Useful_Things_to_Know_About_Machine_Learning","abstract":"MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. 15 Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell 16 and Witten et al. 24). However, much of the \"folk knowledge\" that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.","authors":["Pedro Domingos"],"meta":["October 2012Communications of the ACM 55(10):78â€“87","DOI:10.1145/2347736.2347755"],"references":["221995234_Controlling_The_False_Discovery_Rate_-_A_Practical_And_Powerful_Approach_To_Multiple_Testing","221345426_A_Unifeid_Bias-Variance_Decomposition_and_its_Applications","220451900_Controlled_experiments_on_the_web_Survey_and_practical_guide","220343893_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Voting_Classification_Algorithms_Bagging_Boosting_and_Variants","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","2755783_The_Lack_of_A_Priori_Distinctions_Between_Learning_Algorithms","329476370_Controlling_the_False_Discovery_Rate_A_Practical_and_Powerful_Approach_to_Multiple_Testing","312596137_Big_data_The_next_frontier_for_innovation_competition_and_productivity","306495676_Bayesian_Theory","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","232955275_On_the_connection_between_the_complexity_and_credibility_of_inferred_models","225197318_The_Role_of_Occam's_Razor_in_Knowledge_Discovery","222362755_Grammatically_Biased_Learning_Learning_Logic_Programs_Using_an_Explicit_Antecedent_Description_Language","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220343891_Machine_Learning_as_an_Experimental_Science","220111707_Occam's_Razor","215990907_Markov_Logic_Networks","200033835_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","12204039_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","2862672_Bayesian_Averaging_of_Classifiers_and_the_Overfitting_Problem","2846430_A_Unified_Bias-Variance_Decomposition_and_its_Applications","2578724_On_the_Optimality_of_the_Simple_Bayesian_Classifier_Under_Zero-One_Loss","2569141_Mining_Complex_Models_from_Arbitrarily_Large_Databases_in_Constant_Time","2256832_Preventing_Overfitting_of_Cross-Validation_Data"]}
