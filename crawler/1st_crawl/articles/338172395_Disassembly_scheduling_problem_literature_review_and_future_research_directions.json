{"id":"338172395_Disassembly_scheduling_problem_literature_review_and_future_research_directions","abstract":"This paper presents a literature review on disassembly scheduling problem, one of the important operational problems in disassembly systems. It can be generally defined as the problem of determining the timing and quantity of the end-of-life products while satisfying the demand of their parts/ sub-assemblies over a given planning horizon. First, we review the existing research papers on disassembly scheduling problem and analyze the different models and methods of resolution used to solve this problem. Then, the complexity of product structures is discussed. Finally, we suggest several future research directions. Further study is still needed to address the stochastic parameters, the limit on product return, extra capacity and the setup time in the disassembly scheduling problem.","authors":["Ilhem Slama","Oussama Ben-Ammar","Faouzi Masmoudi","Alexandre Dolgui"],"meta":["January 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(13):601-606","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.225"],"references":["281197321_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_with_parts_commonality_and_start-up_cost_and_its_industrial_application","340774666_Heuristics_for_disassembly_lot_sizing_problem_with_lost_sales","319295975_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_under_stochastic_yield_and_demand","312337935_Robust_single-item_lot-sizing_problems_with_discrete-scenario_lead_time","306073798_Heuristics_for_multi-product_capacitated_disassembly_lot_sizing_with_lost_sales","305923778_Multi-period_disassembly_levelling_and_lot-sizing_for_multiple_product_types_with_parts_commonality","295753368_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_Minimizing_the_number_of_products_disassembled","292664141_Disassembly_Scheduling_with_Parts_Commonality_Using_Petri_Nets_with_Timestamps","287561380_Remanufacturing_scheduling_systems_an_exploratory_analysis_comparing_academic_research_and_industry_practice","282634942_How_yield_process_misspecification_Affects_the_solution_of_disassemble-to-order_Problems"]}
