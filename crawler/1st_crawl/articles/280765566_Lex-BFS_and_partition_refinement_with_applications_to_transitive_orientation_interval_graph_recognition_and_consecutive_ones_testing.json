The algorithms we give are easy to understand and straightforward to prove. They do not make use of sophisticated data structures, and the complexity analysis is straightforward.","authors":["Michel Habib","Ross Mcconnell","Christophe Paul","Laurent Viennot"],"meta":["March 2000Theoretical Computer Science 234(1):59-84","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975%2897%2900241-7"],"references":["230595632_An_Incremental_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Recognizing_Interval_Graphs","220779687_Efficient_and_Practical_Modular_Decomposition","311556606_A_new_linear_algorithm_for_modular_decomposition","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","244509429_The_intersection_graphs_of_a_path_in_a_tree_are_exactly_the_chordal_graphs","238262769_Ma_Substitution_decomposition_on_chordal_graphs_and_applications_In_ISA''91_Algorithms","226376494_Transitiv_orientbare_Graphen","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","220779298_Linear-Time_Modular_Decomposition_and_Efficient_Transitive_Orientation_of_Comparability_Graphs","220617665_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Vertex_Elimination_on_Graphs","220616541_Three_Partition_Refinement_Algorithms","220569648_Classes_of_bipartite_graphs_related_to_chordal_graphs"]}
