{"id":"352773478_The_Employment_Profile_of_Graduates_in_a_State_University_in_Bicol_Region_Philippines","abstract":"The conduct of a tracer study is a potent tool that documents the profile of the graduates which gives implications of how well pre-service training is given. This study focused on the employment profile of the graduates of Bicol University Gubat Campus, Philippines from 2015 to 2017 and analyzed the congruence of courses taken and the employment of the graduates. It gathered feedback from the employers of the graduates as to extent of the competencies they demonstrated in the performance of the job assigned to them. The study covered the seven (7) courses offered namely: Bachelor in Secondary Education, Bachelor of Elementary Education, AB in Peace Studies, BS in Computer Science, BS in Entrepreneurship, BSBA major in Microfinance, and Bachelor of Agricultural Technology. Using the descriptive data analysis method, the study probed on the frequency of responses of its key informants/subjects. Data generated were taken from two sets of instruments administered to both graduates and their employers. Results revealed that the graduates are employable. Most of the graduates were in jobs that are highly congruent with their school training. However, the college must still take measures to improve the skills of the graduates.","authors":["Evan Carlo BOMBASE Deblois"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.52631/jemds.v1i1.10"],"references":["346492283_Institutional_Study_on_Employability_and_Scope_of_Nursing_Graduates_with_Master_of_Arts_Degree_in_Philippines","343803138_Employability_tracer_study_of_Information_Technology_Education_graduates_from_a_state_university_in_the_Philippines","333708847_Development_of_Integrated_Curricula_for_the_Master_of_Engineering_Programs_using_the_CDIO_Framework","333210323_The_importance_of_family_to_people","331785210_Development_and_Effectiveness_of_a_Textbook_on_Advanced_Mathematics_for_Engineering_Programs","330753840_Development_and_Acceptability_of_the_Simplified_Text_in_Differential_Calculus_for_Engineering","330133991_Employability_among_Statistics_Graduates_Graduates'_Attributes_Competence_and_Quality_of_Education","327550245_Employability_Skills_and_Task_Performance_of_Employees_in_Government_Sector","324230977_Graduates'_Competence_on_Employability_Skills_and_Job_Performance","321751650_Employability_Skills_among_Information_Technology_Professionals_A_Literature_Review","320761235_Employability_Capital_A_Conceptual_Framework_Tested_Through_Expert_Analysis","275543928_The_Importance_of_Communication_Competency_for_Employability","273188748_Tracing_University_of_San_Carlos'_science_and_mathematics_education_graduates_How_well_are_we_in_developing_teacher_professionals","257714412_Academic_Performance_and_Perceived_Employability_of_Graduate_Students_in_Business_and_Management_-_An_Analysis_of_Nationwide_Graduate_Destination_Survey","288442810_Personal_Academic_and_career_development_in_higher_education_SOARing_to_success"]}
