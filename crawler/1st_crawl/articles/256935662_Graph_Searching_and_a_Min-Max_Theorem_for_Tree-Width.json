{"id":"256935662_Graph_Searching_and_a_Min-Max_Theorem_for_Tree-Width","abstract":"The tree-width of a graph G is the minimum k such that G may be decomposed into a \"tree-structure\" of pieces each with at most k + l vertices. We prove that this equals the maximum k such that there is a collection of connected subgraphs, pairwise intersecting or adjacent, such that no set of ≤ k vertices meets all of them. A corollary is an analogue of LaPaugh′s \"monotone search\" theorem for cops trapping a robber they can see (LaPaugh′s robber was invisible).","authors":["P.D. Seymour","R.
