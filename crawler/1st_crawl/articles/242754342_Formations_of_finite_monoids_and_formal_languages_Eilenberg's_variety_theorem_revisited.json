{"id":"242754342_Formations_of_finite_monoids_and_formal_languages_Eilenberg's_variety_theorem_revisited","abstract":"We present an extension of Eilenberg's variety theorem, a well-known\nresult connecting algebra to formal languages. We prove that there is\na bijective correspondence between formations of finite monoids and\ncertain classes of languages, the formations of languages. Our result\npermits to treat classes of finite monoids which are not necessarily\nclosed under taking submonoids, contrary to the original theory. We\nalso prove a similar result for ordered monoids.","authors":["Adolfo Ballester-Bolinches","Eric Pin","Xaro Soler-Escriv√†"],"meta":["January 2012Forum Mathematicum","DOI:10.1515/forum-2012-0055"],"references":["275685346_Languages_associated_with_saturated_formations_of_groups","250112007_Languages_recognized_by_finite_supersoluble_groups","268673121_Finite_semigroups_and_the_logical_description_of_regular_languages","266980129_Finite_soluble_groups","266751084_Varieties_of_languages","265980614_On_finite_subformations_of_varieties_of_algebraic_systems","265898142_Subword_counting_and_nilpotent_groups","251221913_Kennzeichnung_gesttigter_Formationen","250603257_Product_of_formations_of_algebraic_systems","247485874_Semigroups_An_Introduction_to_the_Structure_Theory"]}
