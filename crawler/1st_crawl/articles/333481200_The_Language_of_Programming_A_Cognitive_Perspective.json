{"id":"333481200_The_Language_of_Programming_A_Cognitive_Perspective","abstract":"Computer programming is becoming essential across fields. Traditionally grouped with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, programming also bears parallels to natural languages. These parallels may translate into overlapping processing mechanisms. Investigating the cognitive basis of programming is important for understanding the human mind and could transform education practices.","authors":["Evelina Fedorenko","Anna Ivanova","Riva Dhamala","Marina U.
