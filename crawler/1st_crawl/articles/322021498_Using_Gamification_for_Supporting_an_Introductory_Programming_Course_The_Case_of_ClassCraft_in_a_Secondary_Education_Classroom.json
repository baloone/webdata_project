{"id":"322021498_Using_Gamification_for_Supporting_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_The_Case_of_ClassCraft_in_a_Secondary_Education_Classroom","abstract":"Old teaching methods mechanisms are no longer beneficial to the students. In traditional instructional methodology, where the lecture classes are perceived to be tedious by students, the gamification technology has a great advantage to solve the problem as it can improve learning motivation of students. Various studies have shown that gamification under appropriate conditions may create an environment conducive to learning and lead to large increases in students' interest in programming. ClassCraft is a game that it can be used in the classroom to help students to have fun, promote teamwork, and become better learners. In this paper, we present a pilot teaching intervention. The results showed that the general studentsâ€™ performance has not been affected positively. On the other hand, their engagement has been affected positively.","authors":["Stamatios J Papadakis","Michail Kalogiannakis"],"meta":["October 2017","Conference: 2nd EAI International Conference on Design, Learning & InnovationAt: Heraklion, Crete, Greece","Project: Teaching programming in novices"],"references":["323181812_The_use_of_computer_games_in_classroom_environment","322176533_Comparing_novice_programing_environments_for_use_in_secondary_education_App_Inventor_for_Android_vs_Alice","320546761_A_proposal_for_teaching_ScratchJr_programming_environment_in_preservice_kindergarten_teachers","320546665_Pre-service_kindergarten_teachers_acceptance_of_ScratchJr_as_a_tool_for_learning_and_teaching_computational_thinking_and_Science_education","319173328_The_Appropriateness_of_Scratch_and_App_Inventor_as_Educational_Environments_for_Teaching_Introductory_Programming_in_Primary_and_Secondary_Education","315066728_The_Combined_Use_of_Lego_Mindstorms_NXT_and_App_Inventor_for_Teaching_Novice_Programmers","313849509_Using_Scratch_and_App_Inventor_for_teaching_introductory_programming_in_secondary_education_A_case_study","312931525_Knowledge_for_games_games_for_knowledge_designing_a_digital_roll-and-move_board_game_for_a_law_of_torts_class","318664953_Is_the_US_education_system_ready_for_CS_for_all","313376327_Surveying_in-service_teachers'_beliefs_about_game-based_learning_and_perceptions_of_technological_pedagogical_and_content_knowledge_of_games"]}
