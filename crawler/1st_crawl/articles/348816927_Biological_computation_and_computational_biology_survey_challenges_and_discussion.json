{"id":"348816927_Biological_computation_and_computational_biology_survey_challenges_and_discussion","abstract":"Biological computation involves the design and development of computational techniques inspired by natural biota. On the other hand, computational biology involves the development and application of computational techniques to study biological systems. We present a comprehensive review showcasing how biology and computer science can guide and benefit each other, resulting in improved understanding of biological processes and at the same time advances in the design of algorithms. Unfortunately, integration between biology and computer science is often challenging, especially due to the cultural idiosyncrasies of these two communities. In this study, we aim at highlighting how nature has inspired the development of various algorithms and techniques in computer science, and how computational techniques and mathematical modeling have helped to better understand various fields in biology. We identified existing gaps between biological computation and computational biology and advocate for bridging this gap between “wet” and “dry” research.","authors":["Zaineb Chelly Dagdia","Pavel Avdeyev","Md.
