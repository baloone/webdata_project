{"id":"322459256_Accelerated_computer_generated_holography_using_sparse_bases_in_the_STFT_domain","abstract":"Computer-generated holography at high resolutions is a computationally intensive task. Efficient algorithms are needed to generate holograms at acceptable speeds, especially for real-time and interactive applications such as holographic displays. We propose a novel technique to generate holograms using a sparse basis representation in the short-time Fourier space combined with a wavefront-recording plane placed in the middle of the 3D object. By computing the point spread functions in the transform domain, we update only a small subset of the precomputed largest-magnitude coefficients to significantly accelerate the algorithm over conventional look-up table methods. We implement the algorithm on a GPU, and report a speedup factor of over 30. We show that this transform is superior over wavelet-based approaches, and show quantitative and qualitative improvements over the state-of-the-art WASABI method; we report accuracy gains of 2dB PSNR, as well improved view preservation.","authors":["David Blinder","Peter Schelkens"],"meta":["January 2018Optics Express 26(2):1461","DOI:10.1364/OE.26.001461","Project: INTERFERE"],"references":["305036604_Hybrid_approach_for_fast_occlusion_processing_in_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","257533790_Occlusion_culling_for_computer_generated_hologram_based_on_ray-wavefront_conversion","232272349_Phase-added_stereogram_calculation_of_hologram_using_computer_graphics_technique","5257949_Accurate_phase-added_stereogram_to_improve_the_coherent_stereogram","313856940_An_accelerated_hologram_calculation_using_the_wavefront_recording_plane_method_and_wavelet_transform","289676090_Introduction_to_fourier_optics","236188526_Band-limited_double-step_Fresnel_diffraction_and_its_application_to_computer-generated_holograms","41467019_Stereoscopic_approach_to_3_D_display_using_computer_generated_holograms","14288880_Modelling_the_Power_Spectra_of_Natural_Images_Statistics_and_Information","6645283_Use_of_Fresnelets_for_Phase-Shifting_Digital_Hologram_Compression"]}
