In EVE, systems are modelled using the Simple Reactive Module Language (SRML) as a collection of independent system components (players/agents in a game) and playersâ€™ goals are expressed using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae. EVE can be used to automatically check the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in such concurrent and multi-agent systems and to verify which temporal logic properties are satisfied in the equilibria.","authors":["Julian Gutierrez","Muhammad Najib","Giuseppe Perelli","Michael Wooldridge"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_35","In book: Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis (pp.551-557)"],"references":["317318149_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Games_with_Lexicographic_Preferences","303930692_A_Tool_for_the_Automated_Verification_of_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Games","323635059_Imperfect_information_in_Reactive_Modules_games","316080793_From_model_checking_to_equilibrium_checking_Reactive_modules_for_rational_verification","314720288_Sacrificing_serializability_to_attain_high_availability_of_data_in_an_unreliable_network","313571219_Weighted_voting_for_replicated_dataA","311475883_Efficient_solutions_to_the_replicated_log_and_dictionary_problems","309196503_Reasoning_about_equilibria_in_game-like_concurrent_systems","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","268552348_Introduction_to_mechanism_design_for_computer_scientists"]}
