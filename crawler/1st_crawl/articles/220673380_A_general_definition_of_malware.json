{"id":"220673380_A_general_definition_of_malware","abstract":"We propose a general, formal definition of the concept of malware (malicious software) as a single sen- tence in the language of a certain modal logic. Our definition is general thanks to its abstract formulation, which, being abstract, is independent of—but nonetheless generally appli- cable to—the manifold concrete manifestations of malware. From our formulation of malware, we derive equally gen- eral and formal definitions of benware (benign software), anti-malware (\"antibodies\" against malware), and medware (medical software or \"medicine\" for affected software). We provide theoretical tools and practical techniques for the detection, comparison, and classification of malware and its derivatives. Our general defining principle is causation of","authors":["Simon Kramer","Julian C.
