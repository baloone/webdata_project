{"id":"3227139_Computing_with_neural_networks","abstract":"The resurgence of interest in neural networks is discussed. This interest is prompted by two facts. First, the nervous systems of simple animals can easily solve problems that are very difficult for conventional computers. Second, the ability to model biological nervous system functions using man-made machines increases understanding of that biological function. Two popular models of neural networks, the feedforward model and the feedback model, are described. Adaptation or learning, a major focus of neural network research, is detailed.< >","authors":["M.N.O.
