{"id":"303532940_A_Machine_Learning_Driven_Sky_Model","abstract":"Sky illumination is important for generating realistic renderings of virtual environments in a number of applications ranging from entertainment to archaeology. Current solutions use complex analytical models which can be costly to compute interactively; or require the capture of sky environment maps which constitute a laborious and impractical task in order to obtain smooth animations. In this work, we present an alternative model for sky illumination based on machine learning. For analytic models, our approach leads to a low, constant runtime cost for evaluating lighting. When applied to environment maps, our approach approximates the captured lighting at a significantly reduced memory cost, and enables smooth transitions of sky lighting. Our method encodes the non-linear mapping of sun and view direction to radiance values using a single layer Artificial Neural Network. The network is trained using a sparse set of samples which capture the properties of the lighting at various sun positions. Results demonstrate accuracy close to the ground truth for both analytical and capture based methods. Our approach has a low runtime overhead meaning that it can be used as a generic approach for both offline and real-time applications.","authors":["Pinar Satilmis","Thomas Bashford-Rogers","Kurt Debattista","Alan Chalmers"],"meta":["May 2016IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine: the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society 37(1):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MCG.2016.67"],"references":["256097709_Global_illumination_with_radiance_regression_functions","309697799_Neural_Network_Design","286161090_A_Framework_for_the_Experimental_Comparison_of_Solar_and_Skydome_Illumination","284258214_Texture_and_Reflection_in_Computer-Generated_Images","278653176_Brief_Introduction_of_Back_Propagation_BP_Neural_Network_Algorithm_and_Its_Improvement","262149273_Adding_a_Solar-Radiance_Function_to_the_Hosek-Wilkie_Skylight_Model","258073661_An_artificial_neural_network_ensemble_model_for_estimating_global_solar_radiation_from_Meteosat_satellite_images","257929571_Advanced_High_Dynamic_Range_Imaging_Theory_and_Practice","255680381_A_survey_of_the_modelling_and_rendering_of_the_Earth's_atmosphere","254461111_An_Analytic_Model_for_Full_Spectral_Sky-Dome_Radiance","248594699_Efficient_Spherical_Harmonics_Lighting_with_the_Preetham_Skylight_Model","242513955_Display_method_of_the_sky_color_taking_into_account_multiple_scattering","246899051_Multilayer_feedforward_networks_are_universal_approximator","242462012_Rendering_with_radiance_the_art_and_science_of_lighting_simulation","240745168_Rendering_Outdoor_Light_Scattering_in_Real_Time"]}
