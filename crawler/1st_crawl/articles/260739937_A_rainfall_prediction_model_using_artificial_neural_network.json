{"id":"260739937_A_rainfall_prediction_model_using_artificial_neural_network","abstract":"The multilayered artificial neural network with learning by back-propagation algorithm configuration is the most common in use, due to of its ease in training. It is estimated that over 80% of all the neural network projects in development use back-propagation. In back-propagation algorithm, there are two phases in its learning cycle, one to propagate the input patterns through the network and other to adapt the output by changing the weights in the network. The back-propagation-feed forward neural network can be used in many applications such as character recognition, weather and financial prediction, face detection etc. The paper implements one of these applications by building training and testing data sets and finding the number of hidden neurons in these layers for the best performance. In the present research, possibility of predicting average rainfall over Udupi district of Karnataka has been analyzed through artificial neural network models. In formulating artificial neural network based predictive models three layered network has been constructed. The models under study are different in the number of hidden neurons.","authors":["Kumar Abhishek","Abhay Kumar","Rahul Ranjan","Sarthak Kumar"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287140","Conference: Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC), 2012 IEEE"],"references":["290859395_Prediction_of_rainfall_using_back_propagation_neural_network_model","272832321_An_introduction_to_neural_networks","225067619_An_Introduction_to_Neural_Networks","200734688_Rainfall_Forecasting_Using_Soft_Computing_Models_and_Multivariate_Adaptive_Regression_Splines","29630274_An_Artificial_neural_network_model_for_rainfall_forecasting_in_Bangkok_Thailand","313565175_A_time_series_reconstruction_of_precipitation_records_using_artificial_neural_networks","249612578_An_Objective_Method_to_Modify_Numerical_Model_Forecasts_with_Newly_Given_Weather_Data_Using_an_Artificial_Neural_Network","247935154_An_Efficient_Weather_Forecasting_System_using_Artificial_Neural_Network","222522770_Comparison_of_Short-Term_Rainfall_Prediction_Models_for_Real-Time_Flood_Forecasting","2568037_Rainfall_Prediction_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks"]}
