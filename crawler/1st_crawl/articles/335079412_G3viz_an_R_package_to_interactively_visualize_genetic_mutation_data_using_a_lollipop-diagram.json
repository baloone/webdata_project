{"id":"335079412_G3viz_an_R_package_to_interactively_visualize_genetic_mutation_data_using_a_lollipop-diagram","abstract":"The lollipop-diagram is one of the widely used graphical representations to visualize and explore translational effects of genetic mutations in cancer genomics. However, an easy-to-use lollipop-diagram tool with full functionality is still lacking. Here, we introduce g3viz, an R package that enables researchers to explore genetic mutation data using a lollipop-diagram in a web browser. With a few lines of R code, users can interactively visualize data details, annotate findings, and export resultant diagrams in high-quality figures. Because of usefulness and usability, g3viz can be generally exploited by researchers with different levels of bioinformatics skills and programming experience.\n\nAvailability and implementation: \nThe R package is freely available under the MIT license from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/g3viz). The g3lollipop JavaScript package is freely available under MIT license at GitHub (https://github.com/g3viz/g3lollipop.js).\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Xin Guo","Bo Zhang","Wenqi (Wayne) Zeng","Shuting Zhao"],"meta":["August 2019Bioinformatics 36(3)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz631"],"references":["305886764_Lollipops_in_the_Clinic_Information_Dense_Mutation_Plots_for_Precision_Medicine","301822553_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_TCGA_An_immeasurable_source_of_knowledge","251233694_Plot_protein_Visualization_of_mutations","224966136_The_cBio_Cancer_Genomics_Portal_An_Open_Platform_for_Exploring_Multidimensional_Cancer_Genomics_Data","8954964_The_Pfam_Protein_Families_Database","328396251_Maftools_efficient_and_comprehensive_analysis_of_somatic_variants_in_cancer","316842947_Mutational_Landscape_of_Metastatic_Cancer_Revealed_from_Prospective_Clinical_Sequencing_of_10000_Patients","316236431_ggplot2","312532307_Integrative_analysis_of_complex_cancer_genomics_and_clinical_profiles_using_the_cBioPortal","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","273548297_The_Pfam_Protein_Families_Database","236101222_Integrative_Analysis_of_Complex_Cancer_Genomics_and_Clinical_Profiles_Using_the_cBioPortal","51751977_D-3_Data-Driven_Documents"]}
