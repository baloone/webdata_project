{"id":"350603975_Re-visioning_Consciousness_as_a_Newly_Emergent_Concept_in_the_European_History_of_Studia_Humanitatis","abstract":"Human consciousness, or the uniquely human quality of self-consciousness has been a widely contested topic of study and has been dominated by scientific domains of psychology, neuroscience, biochemistry, computer science and even mechanical engineering. But the concept itself seems to have been misconceived and more often misrepresented in those domains which attempt to take a reductive approach. We propose that consciousness is a concept that has always been a topic of discussion under the domain of literature, which first attempted to bring a core human element into serious matter of study. Studia Humanitatis, the precursor to all disciplines \nof humanities, defined and centralized the study of the human subject as a subject. Therefore, it was man studying man as an object of interest. Lacanian psychoanalysis, brought forth this approach of man‟s self-representation back into serious consideration. It attempted to explain man‟s relation with the world and itself in a way similar to the Italian humanists and the modern German philosophers: through symbolism and textuality.","authors":["Tanya Lohan"],"meta":["February 2021"],"references":[]}
