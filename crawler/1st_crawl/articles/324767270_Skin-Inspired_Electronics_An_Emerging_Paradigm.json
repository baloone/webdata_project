{"id":"324767270_Skin-Inspired_Electronics_An_Emerging_Paradigm","abstract":"Future electronics will take on more important roles in people’s lives. They need to allow more intimate contact with human beings to enable advanced health monitoring, disease detection, medical therapies, and human–machine interfacing. However, current electronics are rigid, nondegradable and cannot self-repair, while the human body is soft, dynamic, stretchable, biodegradable, and self-healing. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new class of electronic materials that incorporate skinlike properties, including stretchability for conformable integration, minimal discomfort and suppressed invasive reactions; self-healing for long-term durability under harsh mechanical conditions; and biodegradability for reducing environmental impact and obviating the need for secondary device removal for medical implants. These demands have fueled the development of a new generation of electronic materials, primarily composed of polymers and polymer composites with both high electrical performance and skinlike properties, and consequently led to a new paradigm of electronics, termed “skin-inspired electronics”.","authors":["Sihong Wang","Jin Young Oh","Jie Xu","Helen Tran"],"meta":["April 2018Accounts of
