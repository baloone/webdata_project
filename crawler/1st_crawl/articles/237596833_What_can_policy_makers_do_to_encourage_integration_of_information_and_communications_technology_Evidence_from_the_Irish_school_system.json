{"id":"237596833_What_can_policy_makers_do_to_encourage_integration_of_information_and_communications_technology_Evidence_from_the_Irish_school_system","abstract":"While most countries have invested heavily in information and communications technology (ICT) in education in recent years, the progress with integration of ICT into the teaching of other subjects has often been disappointing. How to encourage integration remains a serious question for policy makers and teacher educators. This article proposes some answers to that question, based on examination of data from the Irish school system. It suggests that ICT integration is associated with two kinds of teacher professional development: postgraduate ICT courses, and short in-service courses focused on specific integrated uses of ICT. The data reveal a strong association between the use of ICT in the school and the ICT usage of the school principal. Finally, it calls into question the use of pilot projects as the agents of change.","authors":["Aidan Mulkeen"],"meta":["July 2003Technology Pedagogy and Education 12(2):277-293","DOI:10.1080/14759390300200158"],"references":["289837929_The_partnership_challenge","275852941_Teachers_and_Machines_The_Classroom_Use_of_Technology_since_1920","246511911_Internet_Use_by_Teachers_Conditions_of_professional_use_and_teacher-directed_student_use","246429150_Implementing_Change_in_Education_The_Integration_of_Information_Technology_into_post-primary_schools","235362849_A_Diffusion_of_Innovations","234646171_The_Use_of_Computers_in_Education_Worldwide_Results_from_a_Comparative_Survey_in_18_Countries","222460024_Attitudes_of_school_principals_and_teachers_towards_computers_Does_it_matter_what_they_think","221644293_Integration_of_IT_into_the_school_curricula_perceptions_of_kindergarden_to_highschool_K-12_teachers","220694510_Diffusion_of_innovations_5_ed","44819972_Successful_School_Improvement_the_Implementation_Perspective_and_Beyond","44819246_The_IEA_study_of_Computers_in_Education_COMPED_implementation_of_an_innovation_in_21_education_systems","31705338_Change_Forces_The_Sequel_M_Fullan"]}
