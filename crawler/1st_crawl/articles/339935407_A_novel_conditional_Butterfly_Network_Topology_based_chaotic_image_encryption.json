{"id":"339935407_A_novel_conditional_Butterfly_Network_Topology_based_chaotic_image_encryption","abstract":"Nowadays, multimedia information, particularly images are shared via the internet and the security of this shared images is a major consideration due to lack in internet security. In this paper, a novel Conditional Butterfly Network Topology (CBNT) based bit-wise confusion, simple pixel-level based confusion and diffusion, based on simple XOR operations is suggested to securely transfer images over an insecure channel like social networks. First, an adaptive image content based initial vector generation is recommended to realize good plain image sensitivity with the aim of withstanding chosen/known plain text attacks. This will change the keys for every plain image in the encryption process. From these initial vectors, Henon map is iterated to acquire the key values to be utilized over the confusion and diffusion processes. To confuse the bits totally in random manner, conditional structure based Butterfly Network Topology (BNT) is utilized. Pixel-based permutation is performed, to disrupt the neighboring correlation of each pixel. Finally, a simple XOR based diffusion is implemented to diffuse the intensity of each pixel. Different security measures are encountered to investigate the amount of security of the suggested system using simulations. From simulations, Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changed Intensity (UACI) values of 99.64% and 33.46% and an entropy value of 7.9995 are achieved. Moreover, the proposed model has very less computation time with high level of security.","authors":["R. Vidhya","M.
