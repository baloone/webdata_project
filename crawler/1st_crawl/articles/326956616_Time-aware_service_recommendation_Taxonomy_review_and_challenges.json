{"id":"326956616_Time-aware_service_recommendation_Taxonomy_review_and_challenges","abstract":"Nowadays, a huge number of available Web services offer the same functionalities and a high quality of service, which makes the selection of suitable services a difficult task. In such situation, the services must be differentiated by additional criteria such as users' ratings. To meet this goal, recommendation techniques become a natural choice to cope with the challenging task of optimal service selection and to help consumers satisfy their needs and preferences. However, most existing models on service recommendation are static, whereas in the real world, the perception and popularity of Web services may continually change, and users' preferences and habits also shift frequently. Time is becoming an increasingly important factor in recommender systems, since time effects influence users' preferences to a large extent. In addition, quality‐of‐service performance of Web services is strongly linked to the service status and network environments, which are variable against time. Recently, a wide range of service recommendation approaches, dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies, have been proposed. Thus, the purpose of this survey is to present a comprehensive study and analysis of the state‐of‐the‐art on time‐aware service recommendation. We identify the techniques used in recommender systems to provide the best services. Moreover, we present a classification of time‐aware recommender systems based on the target recommendation time, the type of relationship between users, and the type of feedback. Besides, we present a comparison between time‐aware recommendation approaches, and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, challenges and requirements of time‐aware service recommendation as well as the future directions are identified according to the studied approaches.","authors":["Haithem Mezni","Mayssa
