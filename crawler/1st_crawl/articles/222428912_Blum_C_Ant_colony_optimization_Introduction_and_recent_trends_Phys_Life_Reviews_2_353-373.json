{"id":"222428912_Blum_C_Ant_colony_optimization_Introduction_and_recent_trends_Phys_Life_Reviews_2_353-373","abstract":"Ant colony optimization is a technique for optimization that was introduced in the early 1990's. The inspiring source of ant colony optimization is the foraging behavior of real ant colonies. This behavior is exploited in artificial ant colonies for the search of approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems, to continuous optimization problems, and to important problems in telecommunications, such as routing and load balancing. First, we deal with the biological inspiration of ant colony optimization algorithms. We show how this biological inspiration can be transfered into an algorithm for discrete optimization. Then, we outline ant colony optimization in more general terms in the context of discrete optimization, and present some of the nowadays best-performing ant colony optimization variants. After summarizing some important theoretical results, we demonstrate how ant colony optimization can be applied to continuous optimization problems. Finally, we provide examples of an interesting recent research direction: The hybridization with more classical techniques from artificial intelligence and operations research.","authors":["Christian Blum"],"meta":["December 2005Physics of Life Reviews 2(4):353-373","DOI:10.1016/j.plrev.2005.10.001"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","301232799_The_Self-Organizing_Exploratory_Pattern_of_the_Argentine_Ant","277677057_Exact_and_Approximate_Nondeterministic_Tree-Search_Procedures_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","277294862_An_Ant_Approach_to_the_Flow_Shop_Problem","277284831_MAX-MIN_ant_system","270572630_An_Ant_Approach_to_Membership_Overlay_Design","260449008_A_new_rank_based_version_of_the_ant_system_A_computational_study","247757097_Dynamic_Scheduling_and_Division_of_Labor_in_Social_Insects","238085345_FUTURE_PATHS_FOR_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_AND_LINKS_TO_AR_TIFI_CIAL_INTELLI_G_EN_CE","235439153_Ant_sytem_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","233553880_Ants_Can_Colour_Graphs","230596114_The_Scope_of_Integer_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","229048650_An_ant_colony_algorithm_for_multiple_sequence_alignment_in_bioinformatics","226910029_Recovering_Beam_Search_Enhancing_the_Beam_Search_Approach_for_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","225962136_Rollout_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Optimization","225454526_Ant_Algorithms_for_Assembly_Line_Balancing","225251159_Multilevel_Refinement_for_Combinatorial_Optimisation_Problems","222721339_Future_Paths_for_Integer_Programming_and_Links_to_Artificial_Intelligence_Computers_Operations_Research_13_533-549","221900771_Metaheuristics_in_Combinatorial_Optimization_Overview_and_Conceptual_Comparison","221492391_Ant_Colonies_as_Logistic_Processes_Optimizers","221492380_A_New_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_Using_the_Heterarchical_Concept_Aimed_at_Optimization_of_Multiminima_Continuous_Functions","221492378_An_Ant-Based_Framework_for_Very_Strongly_Constrained_Problems","320552967_An_Ant_Colony_Optimisation_Algorithm_for_the_Set_Packing_Problem","313753049_An_ant_approach_for_the_flow_shop_problem_Proceedings_of_the_6th_European_congress_on_intelligent_techniques_and_soft_computing","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","312187901_The_ant_colony_metaphor_for_searching_continuous_design_spaces","274732323_A_new_rank_based_version_of_the_ant_system_A_computational_study","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","265453391_The_traveling_salesman_problem_Bibliography","247274387_Programming_with_Constraints_An_Introduction","247074873_Optimization_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","243773378_Multilevel_computations_Review_and_recent_developments","243770427_Ant_algorithm_for_discrete_optimization","243768893_An_Island_Based_Ant_System_with_Lookahead_for_the_Shortest_Common_Supersequence_Problem","242365911_The_travelling_salesmart_problem","239060942_La_Reconstruction_du_Nid_et_les_Coordinations_Interindividuelles_chez_Bellicositermes_Natalensis_et_Cubitermes","239020197_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","235439125_Meta-heuristics_in_combinatorial_optimisation_Overview_and_conceptual_comparison","234778972_Diversity_and_adaptation_in_populations_of_clustering_ants","233595657_Comparing_an_ACO_algorithm_with_other_heuristics_for_the_single_machine_scheduling_problem_with_sequence-dependent_setup_times","233461933_Filtered_beam_search_in_scheduling","227320793_The_Ant_Colony_Metaphor_for_Searching_Continuous_Design_Spaces","222430971_Beam-ACO_-_Hybridizing_ant_colony_optimization_with_beam_search_An_application_to_open_shop_scheduling","222393705_D-ants_Savings_Based_Ants_Divide_and_Conquer_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","221613159_The_Ant_Colony_Metaphor_for_Searching_Continuous_Design_Spaces","221582240_Combining_Ant_Colony_Optimization_with_Dynamic_Programming_for_Solving_the_k-Cardinality_Tree_Problem","221492398_An_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_2D_HP_Protein_Folding_Problem","221492384_Modelling_ACO_Composed_Permutation_Problems","221228624_Solving_Multi-criteria_Optimization_Problems_with_Population-Based_ACO","220901709_ACO_for_Continuous_and_Mixed-Variable_Optimization","220901689_An_Ant_Colony_Optimisation_Algorithm_for_the_Set_Packing_Problem","220901602_M_Ants_can_play_music","220901597_On_the_Design_of_ACO_for_the_Biobjective_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","220901518_Mesh-Partitioning_with_the_Multiple_Ant-Colony_Algorithm","220901524_Integrating_ACO_and_Constraint_Propagation"]}
