{"id":"309338817_On_the_noise_impact_in_the_L1_based_reconstruction_of_the_sparse_time-frequency_distributions","abstract":"Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) are powerful tools for analysis of nonstationary signals, which allow us to observe signal energy distribution as a function of both time and frequency simultaneously. However, TFDs are often corrupted by artifacts, a mathematical byproduct of TFD quadratic nature. A method for artefact suppression is compressive sensing (CS) of signal ambiguity function (AF) in such a way to discard corrupted samples, and leaving only a small subset of artifact-free signal samples. However, in order to obtain a high-resolution TFD, one needs to solve a linear unconstrained optimization problem. In this paper, we analyse noise effect on TFD reconstruction based on various l 1 norm algorithms for different sizes of CSAF regions of interest.","authors":["Ivan Volaric","Victor Sucic"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1109/COBCOM.2016.7593495","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Broadband Communications for Next Generation Networks and Multimedia Applications (CoBCom)"],"references":["294107540_Wavelet-Compressed_Representation_of_Landscapes_for_Hydrologic_and_Geomorphologic_Applications","285087573_A_measure_of_some_time-frequency_distributions_concentration","259638779_Compressive_Sensing_Based_Separation_of_Non-Stationary_and_Stationary_Signals_Overlapping_in_Time-Frequency","256993637_Measure_of_some_time-frequency_distributions_concentration","255602271_User's_Guide_for_YALL1_Your_ALgorithms_for_L1_Optimization","238445979_A_Fixed-Point_Continuation_Method_for_'1-Regularized_Minimization_with_Applications_to_Compressed_Sensing","234067259_Time-Frequency_Mixed-Norm_Estimates_Sparse_MEEG_imaging_with_non-stationary_source_activations","224253615_Compressed-Sensing-Enabled_Video_Streaming_for_Wireless_Multimedia_Sensor_Networks","224117963_A_Fast_Alternating_Direction_Method_for_TVL1-L2_Signal_Reconstruction_From_Partial_Fourier_Data","24344326_NESTA_A_Fast_and_Accurate_First-order_Method_for_Sparse_Recovery","5755670_A_New_TwIST_Two-Step_Iterative_ShrinkageThresholding_Algorithms_for_Image_Restoration","3315110_Matching_Pursuit_with_Time-Frequency_Dictionaries","3085823_Compressed_Sensing","313508668_Compressive_sensing","303430710_Time-Frequency_Signal_Analysis_and_Processing_A_Comprehensive_Reference","301204988_A_Compressive_Sensing_Based_Method_for_Cross-Terms_Suppression_in_the_Time-Frequency_Plane","269634028_l1-MAGIC_Recovery_of_Sparse_Signals_via_Convex_Programming","261029471_Amplify-and-Forward_Compressed_Sensing_as_an_Energy-Efficient_Solution_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","259910613_Time-Frequency_Based_Instantaneous_Frequency_Estimation_of_Sparse_Signals_from_an_Incomplete_Set_of_Samples","258839764_Gradient_Hard_Thresholding_Pursuit_for_Sparsity-Constrained_Optimization","258793245_Sparse_Time-Frequency_Decomposition_and_Some_Applications","256994175_L-statistics_based_modification_of_reconstruction_algorithms_for_compressive_sensing_in_the_presence_of_impulse_noise","224242573_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_for_Sparse_Signal_Recovery_With_Noise","220735533_Sparse_Reconstruction_by_Separable_Approximation","220685538_Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_for_Sparse_Signal_Recovery_With_Noise","220411419_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Reconstruction_Based_on_Shrinkage_Subspace_Optimization_and_Continuation","220321543_Sparse_reconstruction_by_separable_approximation","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","43253192_Time-Frequency_Energy_Distributions_Meet_Compressed_Sensing","43079805_Fast_Image_Recovery_Using_Variable_Splitting_and_Constrained_Optimization","30767985_Imaging_via_Compressive_Sampling_Introduction_to_compressive_sampling_and_recovery_via_convex_programming","3481532_Gradient_Projection_for_Sparse_Reconstruction_Application_to_Compressed_Sensing_and_Other_Inverse_Problems","3321892_Compressive_Sensing_Lecture_Notes","2107851_An_Iterative_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems_with_a_Sparsity_Constrains"]}
