{"id":"261115789_Self-Organized_Resource_Allocation_in_LTE_Systems_with_Weighted_Proportional_Fairness","abstract":"We consider the problem of LTE network self organization and optimization of resource allocation. One particular challenge for LTE systems is that, by applying OFDMA, a transmission may use multiple resource blocks scheduled over the frequency and time. There are three key components involved in the resource allocation and network optimization: resource block scheduling, power control, and client association. We propose a distributed protocol that aims to achieve weighted proportional fairness (WPF) among clients by jointly consider them. The cross-layer design includes: (i) an optimal online policy for resource block scheduling, (ii) a heuristic for transmit power control, and (iii) a selfish strategy for client association. The proposed scheme only requires limited local information exchange and thus can be easily implemented for large networks. Simulation results have shown its effectiveness in both the system throughput and user fairness.","authors":["I-Hong Hou","Chung Shue Chen"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2012.6364444","Conference: Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on"],"references":["228857466_Distributed_power_allocation_and_user_assignment_in_OFDMA_cellular_networks","48207514_Distributed_Resource_Allocation_for_Proportional_Fairness_in_Multi-BandWireless_Systems","313570761_LTE_-_The_UMTS_Long_Term_Evolution_From_Theory_to_Practice_Second_Edition","292252868_LTE_the_UMTS_long_term_evolution_from_theory_to_practice","221166545_Self-Optimization_in_Mobile_Cellular_Networks_Power_Control_and_User_Association","220658276_Round-robin_power_control_for_the_weighted_sum_rate_maximisation_of_wireless_networks_over_multiple_interfering_links","3481556_Dynamic_Spectrum_Management_Complexity_and_Duality"]}
