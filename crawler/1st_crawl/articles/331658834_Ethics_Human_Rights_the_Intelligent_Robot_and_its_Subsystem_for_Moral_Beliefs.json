{"id":"331658834_Ethics_Human_Rights_the_Intelligent_Robot_and_its_Subsystem_for_Moral_Beliefs","abstract":"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifies a number of properties that characterize human beings, such as ‘dignity’, ‘conscience’, and several others. In this article we focus on these properties and on how they have been defined in the history of philosophy. We show how they can be interpreted in terms of a prototypical architecture for an intelligent robot, and how the robot can be provided with several aspects of ethical capability in this way. The key idea is to provide the robot with a Moral Belief System that cooperates with, and moderates the robot’s capability of planning and action.","authors":["Erik Sandewall"],"meta":["July 2021International Journal of Social Robotics 13(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12369-019-00540-z"],"references":["331828762_Cultivating_Personhood_Kant_and_Asian_Philosophy","220605213_Machine_Ethics_Creating_an_Ethical_Intelligent_Agent","303457570_Automated_Planning_and_Acting","269386413_Artificial_moral_agents_are_infeasible_with_foreseeable_technologies","265581530_Oration_on_the_Dignity_of_Man_by","244428452_Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Morals","2819507_Free_Will_-_Even_For_Robots"]}
