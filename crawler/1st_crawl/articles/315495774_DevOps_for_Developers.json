{"id":"315495774_DevOps_for_Developers","abstract":"DevOps for Developers delivers a practical, thorough introduction to approaches, processes and tools to foster collaboration between software development and operations. Efforts of Agile software development often end at the transition phase from development to operations. This book covers the delivery of software, this means the last mile, with lean practices for shipping the software to production and making it available to the end users, together with the integration of operations with earlier project phases (elaboration, construction, transition). DevOps for Developers describes how to streamline the software delivery process and improve the cycle time (that is the time from inception to delivery). It will enable you to deliver software faster, in better quality and more aligned with individual requirements and basic conditions. And above all, work that is aligned with the DevOps approach makes even more fun! Provides patterns and toolchains to integrate software development and operations Delivers an one-stop shop for kick-starting with DevOps Provides guidance how to streamline the software delivery process What youll learn Know what DevOps is and how it can result in better and faster delivered software Apply patterns to improve collaboration between development and operations Introduce unified processes and incentives to support shared goals Start with or extend a tool infrastructure that spans projects roles and phases Address pain points in your individual environment with appropriate recipes Break down existing walls that make up an unnecessarily sluggish delivery process Who this book is for DevOps for Developers is for motivated software engineers, particularly programmers, testers, QA, system admins, database admins, both beginners and experts, who want to improve their software delivery process. Its the perfect choice for engineers who want to go the next step by integrating their approaches for development and delivery of software. This book is for engineers who want to shape their processes and decide on and integrate open source tools and seek for guidance how to integrate standard tools in advanced real world use cases.
