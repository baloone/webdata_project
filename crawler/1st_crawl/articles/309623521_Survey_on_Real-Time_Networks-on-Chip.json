{"id":"309623521_Survey_on_Real-Time_Networks-on-Chip","abstract":"Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs) have emerged as an evolution trend to meet the growing complexity of embedded applications with increasing computation parallelism. Particularly, real-time applications make out a significant portion of the embedded field. Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) are the backbone of communications in an MPSoC platform. However, the use of NoCs in real-time systems imposes complex constraints on the overall design. This paper discusses the challenges faced, when designing NoCs for real-time applications. Contributions in this area are surveyed on the level of guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, adaptivity, and energy efficient techniques. Furthermore, the evaluation methodologies and experimental performance measurements of real-time NoCs are examined. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing endeavors in real-time NoCs and gives an insight towards future promising research points in this field.","authors":["Salma Hesham","Jens
