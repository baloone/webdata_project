{"id":"224460758_On_Computational_Tools_Computational_Thinking_and_Computational_Methods","abstract":"The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.","authors":["Zhang Xiaofeng","Zou Hailin"],"meta":["April 2009","DOI:10.1109/ETCS.2009.120","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Education Technology and Computer Science, 2009.
