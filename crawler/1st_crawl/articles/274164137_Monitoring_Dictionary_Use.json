{"id":"274164137_Monitoring_Dictionary_Use","abstract":"This paper is about finding out what people actually do when they consult their dictionary for help with a translation. The\nmethodology described here was devised for, and tested at, a EURALEX workshop attended by 71 participants from 15 different\nlanguage communities. A slightly modified version was subsequently applied in an analysis of dictionary use carried out amongst\na homogeneous group of 32 Finnish translation students. As so many EURALEX members were involved, we have tried to give as\ncomplete an account as possible, warts and all, of how the experiments worked.\n\nA database was made of the results of the study, and an account is given of the information it holds on different aspects\nof dictionary use: the various steps in the process of consulting a dictionary, the type of information commonly sought, the\nchoice between a bilingual and a monolingual dictionary, the outcome of the searches, strategies employed when a search failed,\netc. It is argued that studies such as this one produce essential information both for lexicographers and for language teachers.","authors":["B.
