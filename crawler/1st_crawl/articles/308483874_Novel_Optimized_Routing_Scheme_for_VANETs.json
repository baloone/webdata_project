{"id":"308483874_Novel_Optimized_Routing_Scheme_for_VANETs","abstract":"The Vehicular ad -hoc networks (VANETs) are a specific type of Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). However, the main problem related to it is the potential high speed of moving vehicles. This special property causes frequent changing in network topology and instability of communication routes. Consequently, some of the challenges that researchers focus on are routing protocols for VANETs. They have proved that the existing MANET proactive routing protocols are the most used for vehicular communication. Yet, they are not as adequate as they are for VANETs. The main problem with these protocols in dynamic environment is their route instability. This paper combines multi-agent system approach and PSO algorithm to solve the above mentioned problems. We carried out a set of simulations tests to evaluate the performance of our scheme. The simulation part shows promising results regarding the adoption of the proposed scheme.","authors":["Samira Harrabi","In√®s Ben Jaafar","Khaled Ghedira"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 98:32-39","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.008","Project: VANETS Routing"],"references":["320717062_The_Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol_Evaluation_through_Experiments_and_Simulation","269273320_A_multi-agent_proactive_routing_protocol_for_Vehicular_Ad-Hoc_Networks","268420070_A_Survey_on_Routing_Protocols_and_its_Issues_in_VANET","228586111_The_optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_evaluation_through_experiments_and_simulation","224761043_Vehicular_Ad_hoc_Networks_VANETs_Challenges_and_perspectives","308520279_RoutingInVehicularAdhocNetworkSurvey","285878299_A_Survey_of_Vehicular_Ad_hoc_Networks_Routing_Protocols","274634544_Performance_Optimisation_for_DSDV_in_VANETs","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","232646855_A_new_cluster_based_routing_protocol_for_VANET"]}
