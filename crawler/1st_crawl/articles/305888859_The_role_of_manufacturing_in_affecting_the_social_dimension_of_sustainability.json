{"id":"305888859_The_role_of_manufacturing_in_affecting_the_social_dimension_of_sustainability","abstract":"Manufacturing affects all three dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and society. This paper addresses the last of these dimensions. It explores social impacts identified by national level social indicators, frameworks, and principles. The effects of manufacturing on social performance are framed for different stakeholder groups with associated social needs. Methodology development as well as various challenges for social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) are further examined. Efforts to integrate social and another dimension of sustainability are considered, with attention to globalization challenges, including offshoring and reshoring. The paper concludes with a summary of key takeaways and promising directions for future work.","authors":["John W. Sutherland","Justin S. Richter","Margot J.
