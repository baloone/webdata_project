{"id":"335329602_Semantic_Structures_for_Spatially-Distributed_Multi-Agent_Systems","abstract":"Spatial constraint systems (scs) are semantic structures for reasoning about spatial and epistemic information in concurrent systems. They have been used to reason about beliefs, lies, and group epistemic behaviour inspired by social networks. They have also been used for proving new results about modal logics and giving semantics to process calculi. In this paper we will discuss the theory and main results about scs.","authors":["Frank Valencia"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.300.3"],"references":["290402640_An_Algebraic_View_of_SpaceBelief_and_ExtrusionUtterance_for_ConcurrencyEpistemic_Logic","237073699_Continuous_Lattices_and_Domains","327526049_Real-Time_Rewriting_Logic_Semantics_for_Spatial_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_12th_International_Workshop_WRLA_2018_Held_as_a_Satellite_Event_of_ETAPS_Thessaloniki_Greece_June_14-15_2018_Proceedin","325245495_Characterizing_Right_Inverses_for_Spatial_Constraint_Systems_with_Applications_to_Modal_Logic","322068027_Declarative_Framework_for_Semantical_Interpretations_of_Structured_Information_-_An_Applicative_Approach","315849678_D-SPACES_Implementing_Declarative_Semantics_for_Spatially_Structured_Information","313067517_Deriving_Inverse_Operators_for_Modal_Logic","308129937_Belief_Knowledge_Lies_and_Other_Utterances_in_an_Algebra_for_Space_and_Extrusion","256555153_Nondeterminism_and_infinite_computations_in_constraint_programming","227998801_Semantical_Analysis_of_Modal_Logic_I_Normal_Modal_Propositional_Calculi"]}
