{"id":"302493756_Google_Analytics_Fundamentals","abstract":"Google Analytics (GA) is an easy-to-use tool to measure activity on a website. A basic setup might take as little as a few minutes, and many of the standard reports are quite accessible and understandable without any special training or prior knowledge of web analytics. Because of this, many users jump into GA without knowing much about its underpinnings—how the data is structured and gathered—and that’s fine for the basics. But eventually, users can outgrow this intuitive understanding of GA and its data, and need deeper insight into how it works and what it can do.","authors":["Jonathan Weber"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4842-0265-4_1","In book: Practical Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager for Developers (pp.3-10)"],"references":[]}
