{"id":"350789280_Concept_of_Web_Programming_An_Overview_of_PHP_Vol_1","abstract":"computer science and its application have come this far and it is standing on a solid ground. But its strength is fully determined by the nature of controls being set in motion by its users. Most often, people tend to say one programming language is better compared to another. Yes; that is not disputed, but the beauty of a programming language is totally defined by the programmer who uses such language. This paper tries to bring out the concept of programming; covering php (hypertext preprocessor) in regards to web development. In this volume (1), the basic concept of this language is looked into so that those who tend to run off its usage should have reasons to say, indeed; programming is not about the software you use, but your skill and understanding of the subject matter.","authors":["Sylvester Ohimogbo Alih","Emmanuel Ogala"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research 10(12):1-6","Project: Web Programming"],"references":[]}
