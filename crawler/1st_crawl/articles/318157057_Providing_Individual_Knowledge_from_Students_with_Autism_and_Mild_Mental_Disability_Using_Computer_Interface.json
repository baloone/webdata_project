{"id":"318157057_Providing_Individual_Knowledge_from_Students_with_Autism_and_Mild_Mental_Disability_Using_Computer_Interface","abstract":"This research is related to the students with autism (SWA), mild mental disability and their interactions with the computer. In this study, Individual knowledge from the students with SWA and mental disabilities were provided by using a computer interface. The students have a very low-level social interaction. The goal of the study is to design the interesting computer-interface with keeping their concentration on a high-level based on cognitive theories. In the study, a computer interface was developed for their efficient learning and use. Thus, user experience is very vital to create a suitable interface. Test questions is prepared to learn their abilities and personal preferences. The test questions are related to their-color like, theory of mind, cognitive theories, etc. This is the novel approach to measure and use these theories to develop a human-computer interface for the students with autism and mild mental disability. The study shows that they are learning well with specific computer interface design while the computer interface helps us to aggregate knowledge about SWA and mild mental retardation. The study includes interesting and beneficial results for their attraction computer interface, learning methods and providing individual knowledge from them by designing suitable computer interface.","authors":["N.
