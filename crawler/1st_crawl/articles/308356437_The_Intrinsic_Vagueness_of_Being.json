{"id":"308356437_The_Intrinsic_Vagueness_of_Being","abstract":"In this paper, we take the approach of the lexicon makers: We contemplate human language instead of trying to resist its forces. Basically, some sigmatoids seem to have been created to be free of boundaries: We fence them as we please when we apply them to our assertions, but they are quite vague in the lexicon. We here identify at least two types of such sigmatoids: The synthetisers and the specifiers. The former would originate from our capacity of isolating common features of objects that, in principle, have no possible intersection. The latter would originate from our attempt of describing the 3D World by means of 2D entities. We conclude that the intrinsic vagueness of these sigmatoids is something not only acceptable, but either pleasant or necessary.","authors":["Marcia Ricci Pinheiro"],"meta":["September 2016","Project: Paradoxes of Language"],"references":["307886803_Quantifiers_1998","287206279_Words_for_Science","287181697_Willard_van_Orman_Quine"]}
