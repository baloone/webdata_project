{"id":"245331566_Effective_activity-based_costing_for_manufacturing_enterprises_using_a_shop_floor_reference_model","abstract":"The accurate evaluation of production costs has become absolutely essential for companies today. Over the past few decades, the ABC method has offered a solution for allocating indirect costs using the cost driver concept. However, the activity-based costing method does not propose general criteria for identifying the relevant resources, activities and cost drivers on the shop floor. This article proposes a reference activity model that enables the activities and resources related to most of the cost objects of a particular shop floor to be deduced systematically. An industrial application illustrates the use of this model. The value of this approach is also discussed.","authors":["Marc Barth","Alexandre Livet","Roland DE GUIO"],"meta":["February 2008International Journal of Production Research 46(3):621-646","DOI:10.1080/00207540600845750"],"references":["274074374_Enterprise_Modeling_and_Integration_Principles_and_Applications","261592181_Use_of_activity-based_costing_and_economic_value_analysis_for_the_justification_of_capital_investments_in_automated_material_handling_systems","250717901_Integrating_simulation_with_activity-based_management_to_evaluate_manufacturing_cell_part_sequencing","229714576_Industrial_Implementation_of_Production_Flow_Analysis","223936660_Activity-based_costing_and_process_modeling_for_cost-conscious_product_design_A_case_study_in_a_manufacturing_company","223701584_A_generalised_cost-estimation_model_for_job_shops","222837035_Activity-based_costingmanagement_and_its_implications_for_operations_management","222541115_A_note_on_optimal_cost_driver_selection_in_ABC","222462378_The_Effect_of_Strategy_and_Organizational_Structure_on_the_Adoption_and_Implementation_of_Activity-Based_Costing","222402487_Application_of_a_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_and_neural_network_approach_in_activity-based_costing","222021275_Activity-based_Costing_Concepts_for_Quality_Improvement","4915901_Implementation_of_activity-base_costing_in_manufacturing","4915836_On_the_applicability_of_activity_based_costing_as_a_planning_instrument","4871643_Improving_activity-based_costing_heuristics_by_higher-level_cost_drivers","4739182_An_international_comparison_of_manufacturing-friendly_cost_management_systems"]}
