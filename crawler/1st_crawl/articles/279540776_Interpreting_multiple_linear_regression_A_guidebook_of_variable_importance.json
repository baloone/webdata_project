{"id":"279540776_Interpreting_multiple_linear_regression_A_guidebook_of_variable_importance","abstract":"Multiple regression (MR) analyses are commonly employed in social science fields. It is also common for interpretation of results to typically reflect overreliance on beta weights (cf. Courville & Thompson, 2001; Nimon, Roberts, & Gavrilova, 2010; Zientek, Capraro, & Capraro, 2008), often resulting in very limited interpretations of variable importance. It appears that few researchers employ other methods to obtain a fuller understanding of what and how independent variables contribute to a regression equation. Thus, this paper presents a guidebook of variable importance measures that inform MR results, linking measures to a theoretical framework that demonstrates the complementary roles they play when interpreting regression findings. We also provide a data-driven example of how to publish MR results that demonstrates how to present a more complete picture of the contributions variables make to a regression equation. We end with several recommendations for practice regarding how to integrate multiple variable importance measures into MR analyses.","authors":["Laura Nathans","Frederick L Oswald","Kim Nimon"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.4159/harvard.9780674063297.c1"],"references":["313637557_Dividing_the_indivisible_using_simple_symmetry_to_partition_variance_explained","309254394_Psychometric_Theory","308077506_Regression_commonality_analysis_Demonstration_of_an_SPSS_solution","291035302_Why_Won't_Stepwise_Methods_Die","289963221_A_study_in_factor_analysis_The_stability_of_a_bi-factor_solution","287833103_Typology_of_Analytical_and_Interpretational_Errors_in_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Educational_Research","271690031_A_Development_of_Multiple_Regression_for_Analysis_of_Routine_Data","265322650_Decomposition_of_R_2_in_multiple_regression_with_correlated_regressors","250183826_Partitioning_Variance_in_Multiple_Regression_Analyses_as_a_Tool_For_Developing_Learning_Models","249836096_Commonality_Analysis_Partitioning_Variance_to_Facilitate_Better_Understanding_of_Data"]}
