{"id":"227624117_Asymptotics_and_Calibration_in_Local_Volatility_Models","abstract":"We derive a direct link between local and implied volatilities in the form of a quasilinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation. Using this equation we establish closed-form asymptotic formulae for the implied volatility near expiry as well as for deep in- and out-of-the-money options. This in turn leads us to propose a new formulation near expiry of the calibration problem for the local volatility model, which we show to be well posed.","authors":["Henri Berestycki","J.
