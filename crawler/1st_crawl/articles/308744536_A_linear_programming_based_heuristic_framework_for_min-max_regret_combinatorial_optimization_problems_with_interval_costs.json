{"id":"308744536_A_linear_programming_based_heuristic_framework_for_min-max_regret_combinatorial_optimization_problems_with_interval_costs","abstract":"This work deals with a class of problems under interval data uncertainty, namely interval robust-hard problems, composed of interval data min-max regret generalizations of classical NP-hard combinatorial problems modeled as 0-1 integer linear programming problems. These problems are more challenging than other interval data min-max regret problems, as solely computing the cost of any feasible solution requires solving an instance of an NP-hard problem. The state-of-the-art exact algorithms in the literature are based on the generation of a possibly exponential number of cuts. As each cut separation involves the resolution of an NP-hard classical optimization problem, the size of the instances that can be solved efficiently is relatively small. To smooth this issue, we present a modeling technique for interval robust-hard problems in the context of a heuristic framework. The heuristic obtains feasible solutions by exploring dual information of a linearly relaxed model associated with the classical optimization problem counterpart. Computational experiments for interval data min-max regret versions of the restricted shortest path problem and the set covering problem show that our heuristic is able to find optimal or near-optimal solutions and also improves the primal bounds obtained by a state-of-the-art exact algorithm and a 2-approximation procedure for interval data min-max regret problems.","authors":["Lucas Assunção","Thiago Ferreira de Noronha","Andréa Cynthia Santos","Rafael Castro de Andrade"],"meta":["September 2016Computers & Operations Research 81(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2016.12.010","Project: Master's thesis research"],"references":["335961944_On_the_Finite_Optimal_Convergence_of_Logic-Based_Benders'_Decomposition_in_Solving_0-1_Min-Max_Regret_Optimization_Problems_with_Interval_Costs","307939831_On_the_Finite_Optimal_Convergence_of_Logic-Based_Benders'_Decomposition_in_Solving_0-1_Min-Max_Regret_Optimization_Problems_with_Interval_Costs","281645600_Scenario-based_heuristics_with_path-relinking_for_the_robust_set_covering_problem","276422223_Heuristic_and_Exact_Algorithms_for_the_Interval_Min-Max_Regret_Knapsack_Problem","270673975_The_Robust_Minmax_Regret_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_with_Interval_Flows","265668231_Accelerating_Benders_Decomposition_Algorithmic_Enhancement_and_Model_Selection_Criteria","316794719_Nonconvex_Optimization_and_Its_Applications","274425476_Quality_of_service_based_routing","273479195_A_New_Bound_for_the_Midpoint_Solution_in_Minmax_Regret_Optimization_with_an_Application_to_the_Robust_Shortest_Path_Problem","264913332_Introduction_to_Stochastic_Search_and_Optimization_Estimation_Simulation_and_Control"]}
