{"id":"350336376_Mask_use_risk-mitigation_behaviours_and_pandemic_fatigue_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_five_cities_in_Australia_the_UK_and_USA_A_cross-sectional_survey","abstract":"Objectives\nTo determine patterns of mask wearing and other infection prevention behaviours in cities where mask wearing is not a cultural norm, over two time periods of the pandemic.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey of masks and other preventive behaviours in adults â‰¥18 years was conducted in five cities (Sydney, Melbourne, London, Phoenix and New York). Data was analysed according to the epidemiology of COVID-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing.\n\nResults\nThe most common measures used were avoiding public areas (80.4%), hand hygiene (76.4%), masks (71.8%) and distancing (67.6%). Over 40% of people avoided medical facilities. These measures decreased from March-July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was associated with younger age, low perceived severity of COVID-19 and declining COVID-19 prevalence.\nPredictors of mask wearing were location (US, UK), mandates, age <50 years, education, having symptoms and knowing someone with COVID-19. Negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of COVID-19 reduced mask wearing. Most respondents (98%) believed that hand washing and distancing were necessary, and 80% reported no change or stricter adherence to these measures when wearing masks.\n\nConclusion\nPandemic mitigation measures were widely reported across all cities, but decreased between March and July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was more common in younger people. Cities with mandates had higher rates of mask wearing. Promotion of mask use for older people may be useful. Masks did not result in reduction of other hygiene measures.","authors":["Chandini Raina Macintyre","Phi Yen Nguyen","Abrar Ahmad Chughtai","Mallory J Trent"],"meta":["March 2021International journal of infectious diseases: IJID: official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases 106(January (1))","DOI:10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.056"],"references":["343780117_Social_and_behavioral_consequences_of_mask_policies_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic","343708973_Improving_the_impact_of_non-pharmaceutical_interventions_during_COVID-19_Examining_the_factors_that_influence_engagement_and_the_impact_on_individuals","342217226_Practice_and_technique_of_using_face_mask_amongst_adults_in_the_community_A_cross-sectional_descriptive_study","341812100_Physical_distancing_face_masks_and_eye_protection_to_prevent_person-to-person_transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_and_COVID-19_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","341809483_Physical_distancing_face_masks_and_eye_protection_for_prevention_of_COVID-19","341045223_A_rapid_systematic_review_of_the_efficacy_of_face_masks_and_respirators_against_coronaviruses_and_other_respiratory_transmissible_viruses_for_the_community_healthcare_workers_and_sick_patients","346331880_To_mask_or_not_to_mask_amid_the_COVID-19_pandemic_how_Chinese_students_in_America_experience_and_cope_with_stigma","342447870_Mask_use_during_COVID-19_A_risk_adjusted_strategy","341892075_Prevalence_of_Asymptomatic_SARS-CoV-2_Infection_A_Narrative_Review","340960861_Risk_factors_for_predicting_mortality_in_elderly_patients_with_COVID-19_A_review_of_clinical_data_in_China"]}
