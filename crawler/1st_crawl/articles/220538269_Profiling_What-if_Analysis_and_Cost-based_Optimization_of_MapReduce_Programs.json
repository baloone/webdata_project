{"id":"220538269_Profiling_What-if_Analysis_and_Cost-based_Optimization_of_MapReduce_Programs","abstract":"MapReduce has emerged as a viable competitor to database systems in big data analytics. MapReduce programs are being written for a wide variety of application domains including business data processing, text analysis, natural language processing, Web graph and social network analysis, and computational science. However, MapReduce systems lack a feature that has been key to the historical success of database systems, namely, cost-based optimization. A major challenge here is that, to the MapReduce system, a program consists of black-box map and reduce functions written in some programming language like C++, Java, Python, or Ruby. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first Cost-based Optimizer for simple to arbitrarily complex MapReduce programs. We focus on the optimization opportunities presented by the large space of configuration parameters for these programs. We also introduce a Profiler to collect detailed statistical information from unmodified MapReduce programs, and a What-if Engine for fine-grained cost estimation. All components have been prototyped for the popular Hadoop MapReduce system. The effectiveness of each component is demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation using representative MapReduce programs from various application domains. 1.","authors":["Herodotos Herodotou","Shivnath Babu"],"meta":["August 2011Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 4(11):1111-1122","DOI:10.14778/3402707.3402746","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242638109_Hadoop_Making_a_Yellow_Elephant_Run_Like_a_Cheetah","228852869_No_One_Cluster_Size_Fits_All_Automatic_Cluster_Sizing_for_Data-intensive_Analytics","314796514_A_recursive_random_search_algorithm_for_large-scale_network_parameter_configuration","314374779_Optimizing_Multiway_Joins_in_a_Map-Reduce_Environment","313580075_A_simulation_approach_to_evaluating_design_decisions_in_mapreduce_setups","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters","312752006_Automatic_optimization_of_parallel_dataflow_programs","240918764_Hadoop_The_Definitive_Guide","224095123_A_simulation_approach_to_evaluating_design_decisions_in_MapReduce_setups","221596266_A_recursive_random_search_algorithm_for_large-scale_network_parameter_configuration","221213817_A_Comparison_of_Join_Algorithms_for_Log_Processing_in","220988112_Starfish_A_Self-tuning_System_for_Big_Data_Analytics","220881050_Automatic_Optimization_of_Parallel_Dataflow_Programs","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220831913_Towards_Automatic_Optimization_of_MapReduce_Programs"]}
