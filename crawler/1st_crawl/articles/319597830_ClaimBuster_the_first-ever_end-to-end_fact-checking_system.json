{"id":"319597830_ClaimBuster_the_first-ever_end-to-end_fact-checking_system","abstract":"Our society is struggling with an unprecedented amount of falsehoods, hyperboles, and half-truths. Politicians and organizations repeatedly make the same false claims. Fake news floods the cyberspace and even allegedly influenced the 2016 election. In fighting false information, the number of active fact-checking organizations has grown from 44 in 2014 to 114 in early 2017. ยน Fact-checkers vet claims by investigating relevant data and documents and publish their verdicts. For instance, PolitiFact.com, one of the earliest and most popular fact-checking projects, gives factual claims truthfulness ratings such as True, Mostly True, Half true, Mostly False, False, and even \"Pants on Fire\". In the U.S., the election year made fact-checking a part of household terminology. For example, during the first presidential debate on September 26, 2016, NPR.org's live fact-checking website drew 7.4 million page views and delivered its biggest traffic day ever.","authors":["Naeemul Hassan","Anil Kumar Nayak","Vikas Sable","Chengkai Li"],"meta":["August 2017Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 10(12):1945-1948","DOI:10.14778/3137765.3137815"],"references":["305730974_Comparing_Automated_Factual_Claim_Detection_Against_Judgments_of_Journalism_Organizations","301801279_The_Quest_to_Automate_Fact-Checking","301800740_Detecting_Check-worthy_Factual_Claims_in_Presidential_Debates","302877356_Semilar_The_semantic_similarity_toolkit","241265029_Question_Generation_via_Overgenerating_Transformations_and_Ranking"]}
