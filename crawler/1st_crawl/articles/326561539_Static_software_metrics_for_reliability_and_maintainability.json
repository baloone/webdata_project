{"id":"326561539_Static_software_metrics_for_reliability_and_maintainability","abstract":"This paper identifies a small, essential set of static software code metrics linked to the software product quality characteristics of reliability and maintainability and to the most commonly identified sources of technical debt. An open-source plug-in is created for the Understand code analysis tool that calculates and visualizes these metrics. The plug-in was developed as a first step in an ongoing project aimed at applying case-based reasoning to the issue of software product quality.","authors":["Jeremy Ludwig","Steven Xu","Frederick Webber"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3194164.3194184","Conference: the 2018 International Conference"],"references":["260649631_Estimating_the_Principal_of_an_Application's_Technical_Debt","221494987_A_systematic_review_of_software_maintainability_prediction_and_metrics","220534289_Exploring_the_Structure_of_Complex_Software_Designs_An_Empirical_Study_of_Open_Source_and_Proprietary_Code","346012783_Software_Metrics_A_Rigorous_and_Practical_Approach_Third_Edition","341713463_The_application_of_software_maintainability_models_in_industrial_software_systems","314507805_Hidden_Structure_Using_Network_Methods_to_Map_Product_Architecture","308859303_A_Case_Study_in_Locating_the_Architectural_Roots_of_Technical_Debt","303830568_Technical_Debt_and_System_Architecture_The_Impact_of_Coupling_on_Defect-Related_Activity","303099272_Identifying_and_quantifying_architectural_debt","300721030_Software_metrics_for_measuring_the_understandability_of_architectural_structures","299909727_Measure_it_Manage_it_Ignore_it_software_practitioners_and_technical_debt","279815205_System_design_and_the_cost_of_architectural_complexity","278647324_Software_Product_Quality_Models","264888784_Empirical_evidence_on_the_link_between_object-oriented_measures_and_external_quality_attributes_a_systematic_literature_review","263392218_Hidden_structure_Using_network_methods_to_map_system_architecture","257390984_Software_fault_prediction_metrics_A_systematic_literature_review","249780477_Textile_Education_at_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","242426219_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_Engineering_Systems","233813965_Technical_Debt_From_Metaphor_to_Theory_and_Practice","220377797_The_application_of_software_maintainability_models_in_industrial_software","3995263_Massachusetts_institute_of_technology"]}
