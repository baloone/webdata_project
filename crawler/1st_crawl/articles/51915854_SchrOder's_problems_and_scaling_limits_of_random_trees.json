{"id":"51915854_SchrOder's_problems_and_scaling_limits_of_random_trees","abstract":"In a classic paper Schr\\\"oder posed four combinatorial problems about the\nnumber of certain types of bracketings of words and sets. Here we address what\nthese bracketings look like on average. For each of the four problems we prove\nthat a uniform pick from the appropriate set of bracketings, when considered as\na tree, has the Brownian continuum random tree as its scaling limit as the size\nof the word or set goes to infinity.","authors":["Jim Pitman","Douglas Rizzolo"],"meta":["July 2011Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 367(10)","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9947-2015-06254-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["344486841_Enumerative_Combinatorics","314006356_Wiley_Series_in_Probability_and_Statistics","267120942_Random_trees_An_interplay_between_combinatorics_and_probability","250969158_Limit_Distributions_of_the_Height_of_a_Random_Forest","247818733_The_Continuum_Random_Tree_II_an_overview","246691020_Limit_distributions_of_the_height_of_a_random_forest_consisting_of_plane_rooted_trees","239030788_On_the_Altitude_of_Nodes_in_Random_Trees","238686375_The_Asymptotic_Distribution_of_Maximum_Tree_Size_in_a_Random_Forest","225842678_Branching_processes_random_trees_and_a_generalized_scheme_of_arrangements_of_particles","220693528_Analytic_Combinatorics","51944069_Invariance_principles_for_Galton-Watson_trees_conditioned_on_the_number_of_leaves","51891361_Scaling_limits_of_Markov_branching_trees_and_Galton-Watson_trees_conditioned_on_the_number_of_vertices_with_out-degree_in_a_given_set","41222059_Continuum_tree_asymptotics_of_discrete_fragmentations_and_applications_to_phylogenetic_models","38360866_The_Continuum_Random_Tree_I","38360674_The_continuum_random_tree_III","38351793_The_depth_first_processes_of_Galton--Watson_trees_converge_to_the_same_Brownian_excursion","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics","2319580_Enumerations_Of_Trees_And_Forests_Related_To_Branching_Processes_And_Random_Walks","2128092_Random_real_trees","2117074_Probabilistic_and_fractal_aspects_of_Lvy_trees","1885473_Gibbs_Fragmentation_Trees"]}
