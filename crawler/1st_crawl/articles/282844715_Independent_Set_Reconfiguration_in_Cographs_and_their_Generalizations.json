{"id":"282844715_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs_and_their_Generalizations","abstract":"We study the following independent set reconfiguration problem, called TAR-Reachability: given two independent sets I and J of a graph G, both of size at least k, is it possible to transform I into J by adding and removing vertices one-by-one, while maintaining an independent set of size at least k throughout? This problem is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. For the case that G is a cograph on n vertices, we show that it can be solved in time , and that the length of a shortest reconfiguration sequence from I to J is bounded by (if it exists). More generally, we show that if is a graph class for which (i) TAR-Reachability can be solved efficiently, (ii) maximum independent sets can be computed efficiently, and which satisfies a certain additional property, then the problem can be solved efficiently for any graph that can be obtained from a collection of graphs in using disjoint union and complete join operations. Chordal graphs and claw-free graphs are given as examples of such a class .","authors":["Paul Bonsma"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of Graph Theory 83(2)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.21992"],"references":["262919947_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Cographs","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","255731177_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220194396_Connectedness_of_the_graph_of_vertex-colourings","46137419_Even-Hole-Free_Graphs_A_Survey","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","285207706_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring_and_CSP_Reconfiguration","262071298_Reconfiguration_in_bounded_bandwidth_and_treedepth","260483018_Reconfiguring_Independent_Sets_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","260107740_Independent_Set_Reconfiguration_in_Cographs","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","235601904_Recoloring_bounded_treewidth_graphs","225519934_Mixing_3-Colourings_in_Bipartite_Graphs","222548494_PSPACE-Completeness_of_Sliding-Block_Puzzles_and_Other_Problems_through_the_Nondeterministic_Constraint_Logic_Model_of_Computation","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","222183106_Algorithme_de_recherche_d'un_stable_de_cardinalite_maximum_dans_un_graphe_sans_etoile","220994909_Motion_Planning_with_Pulley_Rope_and_Baskets","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220908415_Approximability_of_the_Subset_Sum_Reconfiguration_Problem","220618077_Algorithms_for_Minimum_Coloring_Maximum_Clique_Minimum_Covering_by_Cliques_and_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_a_Chordal_Graph","220616628_A_Linear_Recognition_Algorithm_for_Cographs","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148404_Shortest_paths_between_shortest_paths","220074814_On_maximal_independent_sets_of_vertices_in_claw-free_graphs","46585526_The_Complexity_of_Rerouting_Shortest_Paths","30526552_Mixing_3-colourings_in_bipartite_graphs_extended_abstract"]}
