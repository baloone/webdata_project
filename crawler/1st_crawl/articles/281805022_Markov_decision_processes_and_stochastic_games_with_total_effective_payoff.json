{"id":"281805022_Markov_decision_processes_and_stochastic_games_with_total_effective_payoff","abstract":"We consider finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) with undiscounted total effective payoff. We show that there exist uniformly optimal pure stationary strategies that can be computed by solving a polynomial number of linear programs. We apply this result to two-player zero-sum stochastic games with perfect information and undiscounted total effective payoff, and derive the existence of a saddle point in uniformly optimal pure stationary strategies.","authors":["Endre Boros","Khaled Elbassioni","Vladimir Alexander Gurvich","K.
