For a broad class of distribution functions of the servicing time under conditions of a high load, it is shown that the distribution of a normalized number of orders in the system in a stationary regime is asymptotically equivalent to an exponential distribution. An explicit expression is found for the normalization parameter.","authors":["A.V. Pavlov"],"meta":["November 1983Engineering Cybernetics 21(6)"],"references":[]}
