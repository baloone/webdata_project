{"id":"263479544_Mapping_Planar_Graphs_into_Projective_Cubes","abstract":"Projective cubes are obtained by identifying antipodal vertices of hypercubes. We introduce a general problem of mapping planar graphs into projective cubes. This question, surprisingly, captures several well‐known theorems and conjectures in the theory of planar graphs. As a special case , we prove that the Clebsch graph, a triangle‐free graph on 16 vertices, is the smallest triangle‐free graph to which every triangle‐free planar graph admits a homomorphism.","authors":["Reza Naserasr"],"meta":["November 2013Journal of Graph Theory 74(3)","DOI:10.1002/jgt.21703"],"references":["267007135_Firefighting_on_trees_How_bad_is_the_greedy_algorithm","262248282_Planar_Graphs_of_Odd-Girth_at_Least_9_are_Homomorphic_to_the_Petersen_Graph","257407041_Graphs_with_Average_Degree_Smaller_Than_3011_Burn_Slowly","238873873_Countable_Homogeneous_Tournaments","231821111_Finite_quasi-injective_groups","228827064_Surviving_rates_of_trees_and_outerplanar_graphs_for_the_firefighter_problem","225573651_Remarks_on_homomorphism-homogeneous_lattices_and_semilattices","220991216_On_symmetric_realizations_of_the_simplicial_complex_of_3-crossing-free_sets_of_diagonals_of_the_octagon","220357926_Homomorphism-Homogeneous_Relational_Structures","220343098_Partitioning_3-Colored_Complete_Graphs_into_Three_Monochromatic_Cycles","299217659_Grad_and_classes_with_bounded_expansion_III_Restricted_graph_homomorphism_dualities","286031944_Aspects_of_structural_combinatorics_Graph_homomorphisms_and_their_use","285285834_Regular_Partitions_of_Graphs_Colloques_Internationaux_CNRS","277125114_Homomorphisms_and_bounds","266863871_Properties_of_graphs_with_large_girth","265461639_Indifference_graphs","265332413_On_minimizing_the_effects_of_fire_or_a_virus_on_a_network","265226266_The_Firefighter_Problem_A_survey_of_results_directions_and_questions","264470280_2_-Coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_large_odd-girth","263891970_The_surviving_rate_of_digraphs","247810754_The_classification_of_countable_homogeneous_directed_graphs_and_countable_n-tournaments","245809223_Countable_Ultrahomogeneous_Undirected_Graphs","242938380_d-homogeneous_and_d-ultrahomogeneous_linear_spaces","235058342_Regular_Partitions_of_Graphs","229675598_Graphs_and_Homomorphisms","227704219_Circular_flows_of_nearly_Eulerian_graphs_and_vertex-splitting","226816873_Countable_homogeneous_partially_ordered_sets","222962781_The_surviving_rate_of_an_infected_network","222832843_An_improved_bound_for_the_monochromatic_cycle_partition_number","222822818_Extremal_Infinite_Graph_Theory","222686061_Homomorphisms_of_sparse_graphs_with_large_girth","222660856_Extending_Precolorings_to_Circular_Colorings","222576294_Homomorphisms_and_edge-colorings_of_planar_graphs","222525199_Homomorphism_bounded_classes_of_graphs","222410572_Partitioning_a_Graph_into_a_Cycle_and_an_Anticycle_A_Proof_of_Lehel's_Conjecture","222288448_Vertex_coverings_by_monochromatic_cycles_and_trees","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","220548960_Homomorphism-Homogeneous_Graphs","220548845_Forcing_highly_connected_subgraphs","220533661_The_Surviving_Rate_of_a_Graph_for_the_Firefighter_Problem","220453117_Topologically_Sweeping_Visibility_Complexes_via_Pseudotriangulations","220442037_On_end_degrees_and_infinite_cycles_in_locally_finite_graphs","220357746_Partitioning_Two-Coloured_Complete_Graphs_into_Two_Monochromatic_Cycles","220357550_Covering_Two-Edge-Coloured_Complete_Graphs_with_Two_Disjoint_Monochromatic_Cycles","220296814_Grad_and_classes_with_bounded_expansion_III_restricted_dualities","220186884_Posets_homomorphisms_and_homogeneity","220185876_On_the_chromatic_number_of_cube-like_graphs","220078608_Sachs'_Linkless_Embedding_Conjecture","220077663_Homogeneous_and_Ultrahomogeneous_Linear_Spaces","220076410_A_polynomial-time_algorithm_to_find_a_linkless_embedding_of_a_graph","46587653_Multitriangulations_Pseudotriangulations_and_Primitive_Sorting_Networks","200621929_Modern_Graph_Theory","48200515_Forcing_Large_Complete_Topological_Minors_in_Infinite_Graphs","48199470_Computing_Pseudotriangulations_via_Branched_Coverings","46586410_A_new_perspective_on_k-triangulations"]}
