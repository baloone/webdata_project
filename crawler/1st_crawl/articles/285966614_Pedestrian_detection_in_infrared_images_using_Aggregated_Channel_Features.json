{"id":"285966614_Pedestrian_detection_in_infrared_images_using_Aggregated_Channel_Features","abstract":"We propose a method for detecting pedestrians in infrared images. The method combines a fast region of interest generator with fast feature pyramid object detection. Knowing the appearance model of pedestrians in infrared images we infer some edge and intensity based filters that generate the regions in which pedestrian hypotheses may appear. On those regions we apply the Aggregated Channel Features introduced by [1]. We train and test the proposed solution on an infrared pedestrian data set and the results show a good detection accuracy and small execution time of about 30fps.","authors":["Raluca Brehar","Cristian Cosmin Vancea","Sergiu Nedevschi"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICCP.2014.6936964","Conference: Proceedings - 2014 IEEE 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and ProcessingAt: Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"references":["261608822_Thermal-Infrared_Pedestrian_ROI_Extraction_through_Thermal_and_Motion_Information_Fusion","252014257_Evidential_combination_of_SVM_road_obstacle_classifiers_in_visible_and_far_infrared_images","264579180_Fast_Feature_Pyramids_for_Object_Detection","262159113_Thermal_cameras_and_applications_A_survey","261124171_Near-infrared_based_nighttime_pedestrian_detection_by_combining_multiple_features","261116598_Intensity_self_similarity_features_for_pedestrian_detection_in_Far-Infrared_images","251666815_Detection_of_pedestrians_in_far-infrared_automotive_night_vision_using_region-growing_and_clothing_distortion_compensation","250651979_Contrast_Invariant_Features_for_Human_Detection_in_Far_Infrared_Images","247381020_Reinforcing_the_reliability_of_pedestrian_detection_in_far-infrared","232632415_Pedestrian_detection_A_benchmark"]}
