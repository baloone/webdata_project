As an important place for the training of Russian talents, colleges and universities need to keep up with the pace of development of the times, comprehensively and scientifically understand the development opportunities brought by the “Belt and Road” initiative to Russian students in colleges and universities, and constantly enhance students’ professional ability to meet the needs of the market for professional Russian talents. Therefore, Russian teaching in colleges and universities must accurately grasp the ideological connotation of the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, comprehensively examine the existing problems in Russian teaching, and constantly reform and innovate the strategies of Russian teaching in colleges and universities and strengthen the mode of talent training according to the talent demand standard proposed by the \"Belt and Road\" initiative. At the same time, the continuous development of computer science and technology provides us with a variety of convenient methods for analyzing problems. Based on this background, this article studies the solutions to problems in the professional teaching of Russian independent colleges based on computer-aided technology.","authors":["Chenchen Li","Laimei Guo","Lanlan Li"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1648(2):022022","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1648/2/022022"],"references":[]}
