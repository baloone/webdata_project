{"id":"220617732_The_Nilpotency_Problem_of_One-Dimensional_Cellular_Automata","abstract":"The limit set of a cellular automaton consists of all the configurations of the automaton that can appear after arbitrarily long computations. It is known that the limit set is never empty — it contains at least one homogeneous configuration. A CA is called nilpotent if its limit set contains just one configuration. The present work proves that it is algorithmically undecidable whether a given one-dimensional cellular automaton is nilpotent. The proof is based on a generalization of the well-known result about the undecidability of the tiling problem of the plane. The generalization states that the tiling problem remains undecidable even if one considers only so-called NW-deterministic tile sets, that is, tile sets in which the left and upper neighbors of each tile determine the tile uniquely. The nilpotency problem is known to be undecidable for d-dimensional CA for d≥2. The result is the basis of the proof of Rice’s theorem for CA limit sets, which states that every nontrivial property of limit sets is undecidable.","authors":["Jarkko Kari"],"meta":["June 1992SIAM Journal on Computing 21(3):571-586","DOI:10.1137/0221036","SourceDBLP"],"references":["344822006_Computation_and_Automata","275809077_Sequential_Machines_Selected_Papers","243780596_Formal_Language_Characterizations_of_Cellular_Automaton_Limit_Sets","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem","232030314_The_topological_entropy_of_cellular_automata_is_uncomputable","226606019_Undecidability_and_Nonperiodicity_for_Tilings_of_the_Plane","222733193_Reversibility_and_Surjectivity_Problems_of_Cellular_Automata","220616859_On_the_Limit_Sets_of_Cellular_Automata"]}
