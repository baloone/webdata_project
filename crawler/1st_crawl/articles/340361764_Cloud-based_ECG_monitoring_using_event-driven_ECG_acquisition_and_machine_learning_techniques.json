{"id":"340361764_Cloud-based_ECG_monitoring_using_event-driven_ECG_acquisition_and_machine_learning_techniques","abstract":"An approach is proposed for the detection of chronic heart disorders from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. It utilizes an intelligent event-driven ECG signal acquisition system to achieve a real-time compression and effective signal processing and transmission. The experimental results show that grace of event-driven nature an overall 2.6 times compression and bandwidth utilization gain is attained by the suggested solution compared to the counter classical methods. It results in a significant reduction in the complexity and execution time of the post denoising, features extraction and classification processes. The overall system precision is studied in terms of the classification accuracy, the F-measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the Kappa statistics. The best classification accuracy of 94.07% is attained. It confirms that the designed event-driven solution realizes a computationally efficient automatic diagnosis of the cardiac arrhythmia while achieving a high precision decision support for cloud-based mobile health monitoring.","authors":["Saeed Mian Qaisar","Abdulhamit Subasi"],"meta":["April 2020Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine 43(2)","DOI:10.1007/s13246-020-00863-6","Project: Event Driven ECG acquisition, processing and classification for an effective Diagnosis of the Cardiovascular Diseases"],"references":["332080130_Practical_Guide_for_Biomedical_Signals_Analysis_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","327622394_A_61-nW_Level-Crossing_ADC_with_Adaptive_Sampling_for_Biomedical_Applications","324660854_Highly_Efficient_Compression_Algorithms_for_Multichannel_EEG","309442120_An_error_measurement_for_resampled_level_crossing_signal","282875299_A_prospective_comparison_of_remote_monitoring_systems_in_implantable_cardiac_defibrillators_potential_effects_of_frequency_of_transmissions","271394937_Effect_of_Multiscale_PCA_De-noising_in_ECG_Beat_Classification_for_Diagnosis_of_Cardiovascular_Diseases","268291613_Combined_Peak_and_Level-Crossing_Sampling_Scheme","262240257_Adaptive_rate_filtering_a_computationally_efficient_signal_processing_approach","261163026_An_efficient_signal_acquisition_with_an_adaptive_rate_AD_conversion","224439343_Wavelet-Based_Denoising_and_Beat_Detection_of_ECG_Signal","223472473_Integration_of_type-2_fuzzy_clustering_and_wavelet_transform_in_a_neural_network_based_ECG_classifier","220521319_ECG_Signal_Compression_and_Classification_Algorithm_With_Quad_Level_Vector","215446357_Cardiac_Arrhythmias_Detection_In_An_ECG_Beat_Signal_Using_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_and_Artificial_Neural_Network","3416062_Classification_of_Electrocardiogram_Signals_With_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","345653113_Real-Time_Digital_Signal_Processing_from_MATLAB_to_C_with_the_TMS320C6x_DSPs","344959877_Biomedical_Signals","335946363_Efficient_mobile_systems_based_on_adaptive_rate_signal_processing","333438150_On_Quasi-Isometry_of_Threshold-Based_Sampling","327681120_An_Adaptive_Rate_ECG_Acquisition_and_Analysis_for_Efficient_Diagnosis_of_the_Cardiovascular_Diseases","325564787_A_61-nW_Level-Crossing_ADC_With_Adaptive_Sampling_for_Biomedical_Applications","324046139_Model-based_Delineation_of_Non-Uniformly_Sampled_ECG_Signals","323489217_ECG_signal_compression_and_denoising_via_optimum_sparsity_order_selection_in_compressed_sensing_framework","317439523_Feature_extraction_of_electrocardiogram_signals_by_applying_adaptive_threshold_and_principal_component_analysis","315343992_Level_Crossing_Speech_Sampling_and_its_Sparsity_Promoting_Reconstruction_using_an_Iterative_Method_with_Adaptive_Thresholding","313467818_Pseudo_Asynchronous_Level_Crossing_adc_for_ecg_Signal_Acquisition","311533119_Heart_disease_and_stroke_statistics_2016_update","304187728_ECG_Denoising_Using_Marginalized_Particle_Extended_Kalman_Filter_With_an_Automatic_Particle_Weighting_Strategy","297676576_High-Performance_Personalized_Heartbeat_Classification_Model_for_Long-Term_ECG_Signal","288857675_ECG-based_Heartbeat_Classification_for_Arrhythmia_Detection_A_Survey","282490728_A_novel_technique_for_cardiac_arrhythmia_classification_using_spectral_correlation_and_support_vector_machines","273479261_QRS_detection_algorithm_based_on_the_quadratic_filter","271330120_A_300-mV_220-nW_event-driven_ADC_with_real-time_QRS_detection_for_wearable_ECG_sensors","267680859_Real-time_digital_signal_processing_From_Matlab_to_C_with_the_TMS320C6x_DSK","259810163_ECG_signal_processing_for_abnormalities_detection_using_multi-resolution_wavelet_trans-_form_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_Classifier","257403794_Detection_of_cardiac_arrhythmia_in_electrocardiograms_using_adaptive_feature_extraction_and_modified_support_vector_machines","255722725_Application_of_principal_component_analysis_to_ECG_signals_for_automated_diagnosis_of_cardiac_health","251542190_A_novel_fuzzy_c-means_method_for_classifying_heartbeat_cases_from_ECG_signals","46219596_Correlation_technique_and_least_square_support_vector_machine_combine_for_frequency_domain_based_ECG_beat_classification","44637991_Classification_of_the_electrocardiogram_signals_using_supervised_classifiers_and_efficient_features","11895647_The_impact_of_the_MIT-BIH_arrhythmia_database"]}
