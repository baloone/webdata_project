This study examines the global maritime network dynamics from multi-layers (bulk, container, and tanker) and multidimensional (e.g., point, link, and network) structure perspectives. A spatial-temporal framework is introduced to construct and analyze the global maritime transportation network dynamics by means of big trajectory data. Transport capacity and stability are exploited to infer spatial-temporal dynamics of system nodes and links. Maritime network structure changes and traffic flow dynamics grouping are then possible to extract. This enables the global maritime network between 2013 and 2016 to be investigated, and the differences between the countries along the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road and other countries, as well as the differences between before and after included by 21st-century Maritime Silk Road to be revealed. Study results indicate that certain countries, such as China, Singapore, Republic of Korea, Australia, and United Arab Emirates, build new corresponding shipping relationships with some ports of countries along the Silk Road and these new linkages carry significant traffic flow. The shipping dynamics exhibit interesting geographical and spatial variations. This study is meaningful to policy formulation, such as cooperation and reorientation among international ports, evaluating the adaptability of a changing traffic flow and navigation environment, and integration of the maritime economy and transportation systems.","authors":["Hongchu Yu","Zhixiang Fang","Feng Lu","Alan T.
