{"id":"271012617_Reliability_analysis_MG1_queues_with_general_retrial_times_and_server_breakdowns","abstract":"This paper concerns the reliability issues as well as queueing analysis M/G/1 retrial queues with general retrial times and server subject to breakdowns and repairs. We assume that the server is unreliable and customers who find the server busy or down are queued in the retrial orbit in accordance with a firs-come-first-served discipline. Only the customer at the head of the orbit queue is allowed for access to the server. The necessary and sufficient condition for the system to be stable is given. Using a supplementary variable method, we obtain the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the reliability function of the server and a steady state solution for both queueing and reliability measures of interest. Some main reliability indexes, such as the availability, failure frequency, and the reliability function of the server, are obtained.","authors":["Jinting Wang"],"meta":["September 2006Progress in Natural Science 16(5):464-473"],"references":["220462465_An_MG1_Retrial_Queueing_System_with_Two-Phase_Service_and_Preemptive_Resume","220084590_Reliability_Analysis_of_the_Retrial_Queue_with_Server_Breakdowns_and_Repairs","280794792_A_survey_on_retrial_queues","265457378_A_Service_Model_in_Which_the_Server_Is_Required_to_Search_for_Customers","245124782_Accessible_bibliography_on_retrial_queues","242932060_Technical_Note--Mean_Drifts_and_the_Non-Ergodicity_of_Markov_Chains","227974539_Stochastic_Analysis_of_a_Single_Server_Retrial_Queue_with_General_Retrial_Times","227102515_Retrial_queues_with_server_subject_to_breakdowns_and_repairs_Queueing_Systems_72_191-208","226516169_AnMM1_retrial_queue_with_control_policy_and_general_retrial_times","226332837_Single_line_queue_with_repeated_demands","226210929_Single_line_queue_with_recurrent_repeated_demands","223041628_Analysis_of_an_MG1_queue_with_constant_repeated_attempts_and_server_vacations","222084087_An_MG1_retrial_queue_with_recurrent_customers_and_general_retrial_times","220084571_A_Survey_on_Retrial_Queues","24065611_A_classified_bibliography_of_research_on_retrial_queues_Progress_in_1990-1999"]}
