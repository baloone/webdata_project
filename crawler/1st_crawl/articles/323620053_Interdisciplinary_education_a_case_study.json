{"id":"323620053_Interdisciplinary_education_a_case_study","abstract":"Today, interdisciplinary education is a hot topic (Nature. [2015]. Interdisciplinarity. http://www.nature.com/news/interdisciplinarity-1.18295#/Editorial. Gaining an insight into the nature of interdisciplinary education may help when making design decisions for interdisciplinary education. In this study, we argue that, derived from interdisciplinary research, the choice of problem, the level of interaction between different disciplines and constructive alignment are variables to consider when designing interdisciplinary education. Several models of analysis have been used in two descriptive case studies to gain insight into the design parameters for interdisciplinary education. In this study, we AIM to describe (a) the level and nature of integration, (b) the problem definitions as a guiding principle for constructive alignment for (c) the design and execution of interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary education.","authors":["Renate G.
