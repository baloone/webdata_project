{"id":"346073403_Understanding_manager_resistance_to_blockchain_systems","abstract":"Blockchain technology has received much attention in the media and there is an increasing interest amongst organizations within financial services due to the potential benefits. As blockchain-based systems are a nascent technology, the requirements of the technology need to be understood, to allow blockchain systems to be successfully integrated within financial service organizations. There are gaps in academic research in understanding how managers evaluate the value of a blockchain-based system. This study develops a model to explain manager resistance to implementing blockchain-based systems in financial services organizations. This research advances the theoretical understanding of managers’ perspectives on blockchain-based systems and models their resistance to blockchain technology.","authors":["Clara Walsh","Philip O’Reilly","Rob Gleasure","John Mcavoy"],"meta":["October 2020European Management Journal 39(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.emj.2020.10.001"],"references":["341913793_The_Truth_About_Blockchain","341674743_Blockchain_for_5G_and_Beyond_Networks_A_State_of_The_Art_Survey","340456461_Blockchain_and_agricultural_supply_chains_traceability_research_trends_and_future_challenges","335258940_Decentralized_Access_Control_for_IoT_Data_Using_Blockchain_and_Trusted_Oracles","341719849_Blockchain-Based_Trusted_Cross-organizational_Deliveries_of_Sensor-Equipped_Parcels","338538551_Risks_of_the_Blockchain_Technology","338437313_Perceived_Benefit_and_Risk_as_Multidimensional_Determinants_of_Bitcoin_Use_A_Quantitative_Exploratory_Study","336735093_Blockchain_Smart_Contracts_Formalization_Approaches_and_Challenges_to_Address_Vulnerabilities","335897787_BLOCKCHAIN_IN_FINANCIAL_SERVICES","334658727_Blockchain_platform_and_future_bank_competition"]}
