{"id":"261387574_Real-time_accurate_crowd_counting_based_on_RGB-D_information","abstract":"Real-time accurate crowd counting is one of important tasks in intelligent visual surveillance systems. Most previous works can only count passing people robustly without heavy occlusions which are very common in the practical surveillance scenes. To solve this difficult problem, we propose a new method for crowd counting for RGB-D (RGB plus depth) data using a commodity depth camera. In our method, we first detect each head-shoulder of the passing or still person in the surveillance region with fast template matching based on depth information including pedestrian filling with convex hull segmentation. Then, we track and count each detected head-shoulder based on RGB information bidirectionally. By using this approach, we have built a practical system for robust and fast crowd counting. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvement comparing to states-of-the-art approach, and the built system is not only robust to heavy occlusions, but also can be deployed in the real time crowd counting application scenes.","authors":["Huiyuan Fu","Huadong Ma","Hongtian Xiao"],"meta":["September 2012Proceedings / ICIP ...
