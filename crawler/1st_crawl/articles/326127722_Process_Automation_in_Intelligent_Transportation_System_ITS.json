{"id":"326127722_Process_Automation_in_Intelligent_Transportation_System_ITS","abstract":"Collectively, process simulation is an intricate element within an intelligent transport system (ITS); arrange of modeling techniques and subsequent transition operations also form components of such a system. Although the ITS incorporates asset of process automations such as systematic prototypes and simulation, it also integrates computational modeling, and therefore, efficient operational transitions. Processes such as automation, modeling, and operational transitions are at the core of a fastidious ITS. Accordingly, these system elements need to be holistically integrated and amalgamated through effective computationbased methods. Fittingly, the main objective of this study is to examine the utilization of process automation- and computation-based methods as the basis for ITS integration perspectives. In doing so, Sydney Metro will be included as a case study to further elucidate such integration processes.
