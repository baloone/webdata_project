{"id":"265277373_Technical_Manual_for_Strata","abstract":"The computer program Strata performs equivalent linear site response analysis in the frequency domain using time domain input motions or random vibration theory (RVT) methods, and allows for randomization of the site properties. The following document explains the technical details of the program, as well as provides a userâ€™s guide to the program.","authors":["Albert Kottke","Ellen Rathje"],"meta":[],"references":["274955740_Description_and_validation_of_the_stochastic_ground_motion_model","270283546_Using_Inverse_Random_Vibration_Theory_to_Develop_Input_Fourier_Amplitude_Spectra_for_Use_in_Site_Response","247509918_Shear_Modulus_and_Damping_in_Soils_Design_Equations_and_Curves","286337000_Probabilistic_Seismic_Hazard_Mapping_of_the_Mississippi_Embayment","275031189_Development_of_New_Family_of_Normalized_Modulus_Reduction_and_Material_Damping_Curves","273566505_Random_Fields_Analysis_Synthesis","259741744_Tectonic_stress_and_the_spectra_of_seismic_shear_waves_from_earthquakes_including_correction_in_Journal_of_Geophysical_Research_1971_vol_76_page_5002","258464775_Hybrid-Empirical_Ground_Motion_Models_for_Georgia","247504148_SHAKE--a_computer_program_for_earthquake_response_analysis_of_horizontally_layered_sites","246056908_Empirical_Response_Spectral_Attenuation_Relations_for_Shallow_Crustal_Earthquakes"]}
