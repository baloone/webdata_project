{"id":"321697628_Assessment_of_Physical_Activity_among_Adolescents_A_Cross-sectional_Study","abstract":"Introduction: Inadequate Physical Activity (PA) is a common\nfeature running through most public health problems across\nthe world. PA declines during the lifespan, especially during\nadolescence. We studied the current status of PA of children in\nAnand, Gujarat India.\nAim: To study the current status of PA of children in Anand,\nGujarat, India in the age group of 10-19 years.\nMaterials and Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted\nusing a self-reported modified Physical Activity Questionnaire\n(PAQ-A) which has consistently high validity and moderate\nreliability. It comprehensively captures the PA in last seven days.\nSelf-reported anthropometric data and socio-demographic data\nwere also recorded. Anthropometric data was not reported in\n709 out of 3337 participants. Descriptive statistics {mean (SD),\nFrequency (%)} were used to depict the characteristics of the\nstudy population and PA levels. Using age and sex-specific\nWHO growth charts for BMI, we determined the prevalence\nof overweight (z≥+2 SD), obesity (z≥+3 SD) and undernutrition\n(z≤-2 SD) in our study population.\nResults: Mean PA level (n=3337) amongst adolescents\nwas 2.62 (SD=0.72). It was significantly higher in males as\ncompared to females {2.66 (0.73 SD) vs 2.56 (0.71 SD),\np","authors":["Hemal Dave","Somashekhar Marutirao Nimbalkar","Rohitkumar Vasa","Ajay Phatak"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research 11(11):SC21-SC24","DOI:10.7860/JCDR/2017/27080.10870"],"references":["280632233_An_evaluation_of_outdoor_school_environments_to_promote_physical_activity_in_Delhi_India","262266241_Influence_of_behavioral_determinants_on_the_prevalence_of_overweight_and_obesity_among_school_going_adolescents_of_Aligarh","260683154_Recent_changes_in_school-based_policies_on_physical_activity_and_nutrition_in_Spain","255956039_Behavioural_Determinants_for_Obesity_A_Cross-sectional_Study_Among_Urban_Adolescents_in_India","236091686_Prevalence_and_socio-demographic_distribution_of_eating_physical_activity_and_sedentary_behaviours_among_Australian_adolescents","236067192_Promising_school-based_strategies_and_intervention_guidelines_to_increase_physical_activity_of_adolescents","51976743_Physical_Activity_and_Performance_at_School_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature_Including_a_Methodological_Quality_Assessment","51670320_Secular_trends_A_ten-year_comparison_of_the_amount_and_type_of_physical_activity_and_inactivity_of_random_samples_of_adolescents_in_the_Czech_Republic","279891995_Convergent_Validity_of_the_Physical_Acivity_Questionnaire_for_Adolescents","221779293_Determinants_of_Overweight_and_Obesity_in_Affluent_Adolescent_in_Surat_City_South_Gujarat_region_India"]}
