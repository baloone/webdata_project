{"id":"313269610_The_effectiveness_of_wikis_for_project-based_learning_in_different_disciplines_in_higher_education","abstract":"Concerning the effectiveness of using wikis for project-based learning in higher education, this study compared the perceptions and actions among students in three undergraduate courses of different disciplines, English Language Studies, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering, who used wikis in their course assignments. Using a triangulation methodology, the study shows that students mostly hold positive attitudes towards the use of wikis for project-based learning. However, significant differences exist in 5 aspects, such as “Motivation” and “Knowledge Management”, in the questionnaire among all participants. Additionally, the level of participation and core actions on the wikis vary among students of the three disciplines. These findings can be explained by the variations in participants' previous learning experiences, their technical backgrounds and the relationship between learning goals and collaborative learning. A series of insights are offered in the context of the use of wikis in project-based learning in higher education.","authors":["Samuel Kai Wah Chu","Yin Zhang","Katherine Chen","Chi Keung Chan"],"meta":["February 2017The Internet and Higher Education 33","DOI:10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.005"],"references":["311651498_Wikis_for_group_work_Encouraging_transparency_benchmarking_and_feedback","276244962_Wikis_and_collaborative_learning_in_higher_education","272786975_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_and_Learning_Activity_Types_Curriculum-based_Technology_Integration_Reframed","270740985_Interdisciplinary_project-based_learning_an_online_wiki_experience_in_teacher_education","264467167_Pedagogies_of_Engagement_Classroom-Based_Practices","233183904_Wikis_What_students_do_and_do_not_do_when_writing_collaboratively","225516657_Scaffolding_Reflection_and_Articulation_of_Scientific_Explanations_in_a_Data-Rich_Project-Based_Learning_Environment_An_Investigation_of_Progress_Portfolio","225164246_Engaging_by_design_How_engagement_strategies_in_popular_computer_and_video_games_can_inform_instructional_design","220606573_Utilizing_Wiki-Systems_in_higher_education_classes_A_chance_for_universal_access","38138872_Motor_learning_enhances_perceptual_judgment_A_case_for_action-perception_transfer","38009610_Students'_Perceptions_of_Terrascope_A_Project-Based_Freshman_Learning_Community","257496458_Cutting_the_distance_in_distance_education_Perspectives_on_what_promotes_positive_online_learning_experiences","232718028_The_application_of_wiki_technology_in_medical_education","222680658_Using_Wiki_technology_to_support_student_engagement_Lessons_from_the_trenches","200773191_The_good_the_bad_and_the_wiki_Evaluating_student-generated_content_for_collaborative_learning"]}
