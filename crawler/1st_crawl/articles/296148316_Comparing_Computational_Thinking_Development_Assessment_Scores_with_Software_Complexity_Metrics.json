{"id":"296148316_Comparing_Computational_Thinking_Development_Assessment_Scores_with_Software_Complexity_Metrics","abstract":"The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead’s metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.","authors":["Jesús Moreno-León","Gregorio Robles","Marcos Román-González"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474681","Conference: IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2016At: Abu DahbiVolume: Pages: 1040 - 1045"],"references":["284181364_Dr_Scratch_a_Web_Tool_to_Automatically_Evaluate_Scratch_Projects","283118935_Automatic_Detection_of_Bad_Programming_Habits_in_Scratch_A_Preliminary_Study","283118856_The_Europe_Code_Week_CodeEU_initiative_Shaping_the_skills_of_future_engineers","283118749_Computer_programming_as_an_educational_tool_in_the_English_classroom_a_preliminary_study","281714025_Dr_Scratch_Automatic_Analysis_of_Scratch_Projects_to_Assess_and_Foster_Computational_Thinking","262215334_Hairball_Lint-inspired_static_analysis_of_scratch_projects","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","280559547_To_Block_or_not_to_Block_That_is_the_Question_Students'_Perceptions_of_Blocks-based_Programming","271479544_Raspberry_Pi_and_Arduino_Boards_in_Control_Education","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12"]}
