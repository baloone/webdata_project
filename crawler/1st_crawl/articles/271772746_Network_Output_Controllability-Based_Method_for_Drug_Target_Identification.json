{"id":"271772746_Network_Output_Controllability-Based_Method_for_Drug_Target_Identification","abstract":"Biomolecules do not perform their functions alone, but interactively with one another to form so called biomolecular networks. It is well known that a complex disease stems from the malfunctions of corresponding biomolecular networks. Therefore, one of important tasks is to identify drug targets from biomolecular networks. In this study, the drug target identification is formulated as a problem of finding steering nodes in biomolecular networks while the concept of network output controllability is applied to the problem of drug target identification. By applying control signals to these steering nodes, the biomolecular networks are expected to be transited from one state to another. A graphtheoretic algorithm has been proposed to find a minimum set of steering nodes in biomolecular networks which can be a potential set of drug targets. Application results of the method to real biomolecular networks show that identified potential drug targets are in agreement with existing research results. This indicates that the method can generate testable predictions and provide insights into experimental design of drug discovery.","authors":["Lin Wu","Yichao Shen","Min Li","Fangxiang Wu"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE transactions on nanobioscience 14(2)","DOI:10.1109/TNB.2015.2391175","SourcePubMed"],"references":["321663699_Integrating_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Networks_with_Gene-_Gene_Co-Expression_Networks_improves_Gene_Signatures_for_Classifying_Breast_Cancer_Metastasis","267735760_Identifying_disease_genes_by_integrating_multiple_data_sources","267044743_Disease_gene_identification_by_using_graph_kernels_and_Markov_random_fields","262789756_Detection_of_driver_metabolites_in_the_human_liver_metabolic_network_using_structural_controllability_analysis","261920689_Transittability_of_complex_networks_and_its_applications_to_regulatory_biomolecular_networks","249965508_Discovery_of_a_kernel_for_controlling_biomolecular_regulatory_networks","242333283_Realistic_Control_of_Network_Dynamics","236129754_Attack_Robustness_and_Centrality_of_Complex_Networks","233724833_Computational_approaches_to_predicting_essential_proteins_A_survey","231743151_Control_Centrality_and_Hierarchical_Structure_in_Complex_Networks","229324382_Iteration_method_for_predicting_essential_proteins_based_on_ontology_and_protein-protein_interaction_networks","228116419_Nodal_Dynamics_Not_Degree_Distributions_Determine_the_Structural_Controllability_of_Complex_Networks","228101603_Network-based_characterization_of_drug-regulated_genes_drug_targets_and_toxicity","51968342_Controlling_edge_dynamics_in_complex_networks","51898937_Integrating_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Networks_with_Gene-Gene_Co-Expression_Networks_improves_Gene_Signatures_for_Classifying_Breast_Cancer_Metastasis","51234826_Two-stage_flux_balance_analysis_of_metabolic_networks_for_drug_target_identification","51117462_Controllability_of_complex_networks","49689407_Network_Medicine_A_Network-based_Approach_to_Human_Disease","47644669_Proof_of_Concept_Network_and_Systems_Biology_Approaches_Aid_in_the_Discovery_of_Potent_Anticancer_Drug_Combinations","46818401_A_systems_biology_approach_to_identify_effective_cocktail_drugs","41103157_Associating_Genes_and_Protein_Complexes_with_Disease_via_Network_Propagation","37509382_Determination_of_Generic_Dimensions_of_Controllable_Subspaces_and_Its_Application","23452285_Finding_multiple_target_optimal_intervention_in_disease-related_molecular_network","12710574_From_Molecular_to_Modular_Cell_Biology","12709522_KEGG_kyoto_Encyclopedia_of_Genes_and_Genomes","12290611_The_Large-Scale_Organization_of_Metabolic_Networks","7928620_The_efficiency_of_multi-target_drugs_The_network_approach_might_help_drug_design","7254780_Low_Degree_Metabolites_Explain_Essential_Reactions_and_Enhance_Modularity_in_Biological_Networks","7167941_Predicting_disease_genes_using_proteinCprotein_interactions","5645530_Biomolecular_network_querying_A_promising_approach_in_systems_biology","5621595_Mining_metabolic_network_for_optimal_drug_targets","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","297040568_Structural_controllability","285356137_Introduction","264718116_Nanoscale_Adhesive_Properties_of_Graphene_The_Effect_of_Sliding_History","256101217_Identifying_Protein_Complexes_Based_on_Multiple_Topological_Structures_in_PPI_Networks","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","239948537_Identifying_protein_complexes_and_functional_modules-from_static_PPI_networks_to_dynamic_PPI_networks","234794391_Modern_Control_Engineering","223410803_Control_System_Engineering_Education","220045413_Mathematical_Description_of_Linear_Dynamical_Systems","40040914_Detecting_drug_targets_with_minimum_side_effects_in_metabolic_networks","9066434_Innovation_Target_discovery","7487401_Virtual_Identification_of_Essential_Proteins_Within_the_Protein_Interaction_Network_of_Yeast","7245731_Prostaglandin_E_Synthase_A_Novel_Drug_Target_for_Inflammation_and_Cancer","5237781_Identification_of_Information_Flow-Modulating_Drug_Targets_A_Novel_Bridging_Paradigm_for_Drug_Discovery","3027595_Structural_Controllability_of_Multi_input_Systems","3027079_Structural_Controllability","3020649_Note_on_a_Graph-Theoretic_Criterion_for_Structural_Output_Controllability","3020537_On_the_Generic_Dimension_of_Controllable_Subspaces"]}
