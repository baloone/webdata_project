{"id":"320852115_Data_Literacy_for_Greater_Civic_Participation_in_Smart_Cities-Visualising_Open_Mobility_Data","abstract":"Nowadays, governments are faced with multiple challenges, often regarding the use of technology as an enabler, to tackle urban problems. Amidst recent ‘Smart City’ initiatives, open data is becoming a defining element to bridge the needs of citizens with decision-making processes of public actors. However, getting the data out in the right technical format is not enough. This study examines how open data and its visualisations allow for effective citizen engagement and sense making, drawing from the experience of four European pilot studies in the OpenTransportNet project. Results about data literacy were collected through regular self-assessment questionnaires with civil servants and pilot coordinators, logging statistics, and qualitative feedback gathering during workshops, observations and interviews. The results of this project show that the open data movement is at its next frontier: data literacy. Publishing open data is not enough; sense making, through visualisations for example, can support a wider range of citizens to take active citizenship about certain topics of mobility in the city.","authors":["Carina Veeckman","Gavin McCrory","Nils Walravens"],"meta":["June 2017","Conference: 21st Conference of the Environmental and Sustainability Management Accounting Network (EMAN)At: Liège, Belgium"],"references":["347531630_Creating_an_Understanding_of_Data_Literacy_for_a_Data-driven_Society","326309915_Living_Labs_as_Open-Innovation_Networks","310716477_Data_Literacy_-_What_is_it_and_how_can_we_make_it_happen","294894481_Opening_up_Smart_Cities_Citizen-Centric_Challenges_and_Opportunities_from_GIScience","280625326_A_Tale_of_Open_Data_Innovations_in_Five_Smart_Cities","313363112_datagovuk_-_The_Linked_Data_Revolution"]}
