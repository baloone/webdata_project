{"id":"313870728_Toward_development_of_automated_plasmodium_detection_for_Malaria_diagnosis_in_thin_blood_smear_image_An_overview","abstract":"This paper illustrates a comprehensive review about malaria identification method on thin blood smear, including conventional identification by expert and computer-aided identification. Even though effective way to overcome the malaria has been discovered, in fact these cases is still growing among developed country and murdering 1 million people annually; 90% of them are children from Africa. There exist clinical, laboratorial, and molecular method in diagnosing malaria, however the whole process mostly committed conventionally using microscope and expertise. Nowadays, with the presence of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) â€” Image Processing, plasmodium identification of malaria can be performed rapidly, affordable, and more accurate.","authors":["Wahyu andi Saputra","Hanung Adi Nugroho","Adhistya Erna Permanasari"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICITSI.2016.7858228","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI)"],"references":["258244970_Short_Report_Polymerase_Chain_Reaction_Detection_of_Plasmodium_vivax_and_Plasmodium_falciparum_DNA_from_Stored_Serum_Samples_Implications_for_Retrospective_Diagnosis_of_Malaria","257068690_Colour_Image_Segmentation_Approach_for_Detection_of_Malaria_Parasites_Using_Various_Colour_Models_and_k-Means_Clustering","229087913_Fuzzy_tumor_segmentation_based_on_iterative_watersheds","229035721_Automatic_Detection_of_Malaria_Parasites_for_Estimating","225199502_Blood_Cell_Image_Segmentation_A_Review","23448865_Short_Report_Evaluation_of_Two_New_Immunochromatographic_Assays_for_Diagnosis_of_Malaria","23427417_Operational_accuracy_and_comparative_persistent_antigenicity_of_HRP2_rapid_diagnostic_tests_for","8183544_Overdiagnosis_of_malaria_in_patients_with_severe_febrile_illness_in_Tanzania_A_prospective_study","281806951_Automated_system_for_malaria_parasite_identification","281171706_Blood_Smear_Image_Based_Malaria_Parasite_and_Infected-Erythrocyte_Detection_and_Segmentation","272582039_An_Introduction_to_Dynamic_Programming","261527960_Automated_malaria_parasite_detection_in_thin_blood_films-_A_hybrid_illumination_and_color_constancy_insensitive_morphological_approach","220815053_Hierarchical_Genetic_Algorithms_Operating_on_Populations_of_Computer_Programs","216300097_Genetic_Programming--An_Introduction","26259163_Malaria_Diagnosis_A_Brief_Review","25394432_A_Manual_of_Tropical_Medicine","23937288_A_semi-automatic_method_for_quantification_and_classification_of_erythrocytes_infected_with_malaria_parasites_in_microscopic_images","15659067_QBCR_and_Giemsa-stained_thick_blood_films_diagnostic_performance_of_laboratory_technologists","11577441_Rapid_Diagnostic_Tests_for_Malaria_Parasites","7801817_Clinical_algorithms_for_malaria_diagnosis_lack_utility_among_people_of_different_age_groups","6440886_Comparison_of_Immunofluorescence_Antibody_Testing_and_Two_Enzyme_Immunoassays_in_the_Serologic_Diagnosis_of_Malaria","5434579_Comparative_study_of_peripheral_blood_smear_quantitative_buffy_coat_and_modified_centrifuged_blood_smear_in_malaria_diagnosis","3887538_Automatic_thresholding_of_infected_blood_images_using_granulometryand_regional_extrema"]}
