{"id":"264947516_A_PTAS_for_the_disk_cover_problem_of_geometric_objects","abstract":"We present PTASs for the disk cover problem: given geometric objects and a finite set of disk centers, minimize the total cost for covering those objects with disks under a polynomial cost function on the disksâ€™ radii. We describe the first FPTAS for covering a line segment when the disk centers form a discrete set, and a PTAS for when a set of geometric objects, described by polynomial algebraic inequalities, must be covered. The latter result holds for any dimension.","authors":["Pedro J.
