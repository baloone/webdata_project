{"id":"311103293_Tractable_Classes_for_CSPs_of_Arbitrary_Arity_From_Theory_to_Practice","abstract":"The research of this thesis focuses on the analysis of polynomial classes and their practical exploitation for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with finite domains. In particular, I worked on bridging the gap between theoretical works and practical results in constraint solvers. Specifically, the goal of this thesis is to find explanation for the effectiveness of solvers, and also to show that studied tractable classes are not artificial since several real-problems among the ones used in the CSP 2008 Competition belong to them.","authors":["Achref El Mouelhi"],"meta":["July 2017Constraints 22(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-016-9262-x","Project: Tractability, constraint decomposition, value merging, variable elmination"],"references":[]}
