{"id":"220153974_Testing_Equivalences_for_Processes","abstract":"Given a set of processes and a set of tests on these processes we show how to define in a natural way three different equivalences on processes. These equivalences are applied to a particular language CCS. We give associated complete proof systems and fully abstract models. These models have a simple representation in terms of trees.","authors":["Rocco De Nicola","Matthew Hennessy"],"meta":["December 1984Theoretical Computer Science 34(1-2):83-133","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(84)90113-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220431839_A_Theory_of_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","213877138_Data_Types_as_Lattices","2314427_Experience_with_processes_and_monitors_in_MESA","262396232_Communicating_Sequential_Process","256221902_Power_domains","234780570_Initial_Algebra_Semantics_and_Continuous_Algebras","232646452_Possible_futures_acceptances_refusals_and_communicating_processes","225503765_A_Theory_of_Non-Determinism","222379573_Varieties_of_ordered_algebras","221534815_Powerdomains_and_nondeterministic_recursive_definitions","221150033_A_Complete_Set_of_Axioms_for_a_Theory_of_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","220975701_A_term_model_for_CCS","220897101_On_Observing_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency","220896867_A_Theory_of_Nondeterminism","220688271_Algebraic_Semantics","220688100_A_Calculus_of_Communicating_System","220574345_Semantics_of_Nondeterminism_Concurrency_and_Communication","220421990_Distributed_Processes_A_Concurrent_Programming_Concept","220246930_A_Term_Model_for_Synchronous_Processes","220070445_The_Programming_Language_Concurrent_Pascal","213881955_A_Powerdomain_Construction","46102582_A_model_for_communicating_sequential_process","35720078_Formal_semantics_of_nondeterminism_and_parallelism","4354698_Algebraic_families_of_interpretations"]}
