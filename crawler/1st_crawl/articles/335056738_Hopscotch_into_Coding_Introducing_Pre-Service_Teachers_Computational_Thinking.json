{"id":"335056738_Hopscotch_into_Coding_Introducing_Pre-Service_Teachers_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"Researchers and educators have advocated computational thinking (CT) should be integrated into K-12 settings as early as elementary schools. However, there has been a lack of knowledge of how pre-service K-8 teachers would be engaged in the learning of CT and its integration in different subject areas. In this study, we taught a flipped learning module in an undergraduate Educational Technology course. Pre-service teachers learned and practiced CT knowledge and skills using a block programming app called Hopscotch. Results of this first iteration of design-based research showed that the orchestration of the technology and instructional methods, such as team-based learning, flipped classroom, and pair programming, supported studentsâ€™ transformative learning experience. It improved their understanding and application of CT concepts. Meanwhile, the mixed-method analysis found some instructional issues that needed to be addressed in future iterations. Suggestions were provided at the end of the paper.","authors":["Shenghua Zha","Yi Jin","Pamela Moore","Joe Gaston"],"meta":["August 2019TechTrends 64(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-019-00423-0"],"references":["326225116_Using_NVivo_for_Literature_Reviews_The_Eight_Step_Pedagogy_N71","318675079_Resetting_educational_technology_coursework_for_pre-service_teachers_A_computational_thinking_approach_to_the_development_of_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_TPACK","316446592_Computational_Thinking_in_Teacher_Education","331843099_Team-Based_Learning_A_Transformative_Use_of_Small_Groups_in_College_Teaching","325781581_Coding_in_K-8_International_Trends_in_Teaching_ElementaryPrimary_Computing","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","324346734_Simultaneous_Statistical_Inference","322017704_Learning_About_Makerspaces_Professional_Development_with_K-12_Inservice_Educators","318600661_Changing_a_Generation's_Way_of_Thinking_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_Through_Programming","318082927_Team-Based_Learning_in_a_Community_Health_Nursing_Course_Improving_Academic_Outcomes"]}
