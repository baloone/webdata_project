{"id":"264197576_scikit-image_Image_processing_in_Python","abstract":"scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms and\nutilities for use in research, education and industry applications. It is\nreleased under the liberal \"Modified BSD\" open source license, provides a\nwell-documented API in the Python programming language, and is developed by an\nactive, international team of collaborators. In this paper we highlight the\nadvantages of open source to achieve the goals of the scikit-image library, and\nwe showcase several real-world image processing applications that use\nscikit-image.","authors":["Stéfan Johann van der Walt","Johannes Lutz Schönberger","Juan Nunez-Iglesias","François Boulogne"],"meta":["July 2014PeerJ 2(2)","DOI:10.7717/peerj.453","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282663628_Scipy_Lecture_Notes","234781122_IETF_Working_Group_Guidelines_and_Procedures","233730490_Mahotas_Open_source_software_for_scriptable_computer_vision","232232556_Open_is_Not_Enough_Let's_Take_the_Next_Step_An_Integrated_Community-Driven_Computing_Platform_for_Neuroscience","322276713_The_openCV_library","313557209_Random_sample_consensus_A_paradigm_for_model_fitting_applications_to_image_analysis_and_automated_cartography","312796739_Style_Guide_for_Python","295713063_Therapeutic_interventions_for_acute_spinal_cord_injury_in_rats","247283421_Proper_Treatment_Of_Pixels_As_Integers","233950935_The_Opencv_Library"]}
