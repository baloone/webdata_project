{"id":"320201724_Eve_An_Automated_Question_Answering_System_for_Events_Information","abstract":"The objective of this research was to create a closed-domain of automated question answering system specifically for events called Eve. Automated Question Answering System (QAS) is a system that accepts question input in the form of natural language. The question will be processed through modules to finally return the most appropriate answer to the corresponding question instead of returning a full document as an output. The\nscope of the events was those which were organized by Students Association of Computer Science (HIMTI) in Bina Nusantara University. It consisted of 3 main modules namely query processing, information retrieval, and information extraction. Meanwhile, the approaches used in this system included question classification, document indexing, named entity recognition and others. For the results, the system can answer 63 questions for word matching technique, and 32 questions for word similarity technique out of 94 questions correctly.","authors":["Ivan Christanno","Priscilla Priscilla","Jody Johansyah Maulana","Derwin Suhartono"],"meta":["March 2017ComTech Computer Mathematics and Engineering Applications 8(1):15","DOI:10.21512/comtech.v8i1.3781"],"references":["283161590_Using_Vector_Space_Model_in_Question_Answering_System","228617419_An_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Relatedness_Between_Words_via_Related_Terms","228455968_From_Minimal_Logical_Forms_for_Answer_Extraction_to_Logical_Graphs_for_Question_Answering","226032053_Answering_questions_with_an_n-gram_based_passage_retrieval_engine","279345259_Encyclopedia_of_Database_Systems","270877457_Comparing_Word_Relatedness_Measures_Based_on_Google_n-grams","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach"]}
