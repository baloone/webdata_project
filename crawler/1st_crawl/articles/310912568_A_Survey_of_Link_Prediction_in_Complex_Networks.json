{"id":"310912568_A_Survey_of_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks","abstract":"Networks have become increasingly important to model complex systems comprised of interacting elements.\nNetwork data mining has a large number of applications in many disciplines including protein-protein interaction\nnetworks, social networks, transportation networks, and telecommunication networks. Different\nempirical studies have shown that it is possible to predict new relationships between elements attending\nto the topology of the network and the properties of its elements. The problem of predicting new relationships\nin networks is called link prediction. Link prediction aims to infer the behavior of the network link\nformation process by predicting missed or future relationships based on currently observed connections. It\nhas become an attractive area of study since it allows us to predict how networks will evolve. In this survey\nwe will review the general-purpose techniques at the heart of the link prediction problem, which can be\ncomplemented by domain-specific heuristic methods in practice.","authors":["Víctor Martínez","Fernando Berzal","Juan-Carlos Cubero"],"meta":["December 2016ACM Computing Surveys 49(4):69","DOI:10.1145/3012704","Project: NOESIS"],"references":["326710867_Hierarchical_organization_in_complex_networks","316966500_Assessing_and_Predicting_Protein_Interactions_Using_Both_Local_and_Global_Network_Topological_Metrics","314818914_SimRank_a_measure_of_structural-context_similarity","312911596_A_method_of_establishing_groups_of_equal_amplitude_in_plant_sociology_based_on_similarity_of_species_and_its_application_to_analyses_of_the_vegetation_on_Danish_commons","308796991_A_measure_of_similarity_between_graph_vertices_Applications_to_synonym_extraction_and_web_searching","304496880_Link_prediction_in_complex_networks_A_survey","301233236_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","291099186_Similarity_Measures_for_Link_Prediction_Using_Power_Law_Degree_Distribution","289196872_A_link_prediction_algorithm_based_on_socialized_semi-local_information","277289291_Link_Prediction_Using_Supervised_Learning","288970909_Method_of_establishing_groups_of_equal_amplitude_in_plant_sociology_based_on_similarity_of_species_content_and_its_application_to_analyses_of_the_vegetation_on_Danish_Commons","288055897_Adaptive_degree_penalization_for_link_prediction","284568271_Spectral_Graph_Theory","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks"]}
