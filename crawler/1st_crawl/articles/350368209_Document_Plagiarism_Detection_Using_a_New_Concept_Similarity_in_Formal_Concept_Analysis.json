{"id":"350368209_Document_Plagiarism_Detection_Using_a_New_Concept_Similarity_in_Formal_Concept_Analysis","abstract":"This paper proposes an algorithm for document plagiarism detection using the provided incremental knowledge construction with formal concept analysis (FCA). The incremental knowledge construction is presented to support document matching between the source document in storage and the suspect document. Thus, a new concept similarity measure is also proposed for retrieving formal concepts in the knowledge construction. The presented concept similarity employs appearance frequencies in the obtained knowledge construction. Our approach can be applied to retrieve relevant information because the obtained structure uses FCA in concept form that is definable by a conjunction of properties. This measure is mathematically proven to be a formal similarity metric. The performance of the proposed similarity measure is demonstrated in document plagiarism detection. Moreover, this paper provides an algorithm to build the information structure for document plagiarism detection. Thai text test collections are used for performance evaluation of the implemented web application.","authors":["Jirapond Muangprathub","Siriwan Kajornkasirat","Apirat Wanichsombat"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Applied Mathematics 2021(10):1-10","DOI:10.1155/2021/6662984"],"references":["328811108_Scalable_formal_concept_analysis_algorithms_for_large_datasets_using_Spark","319210927_A_Novel_Technique_for_Detecting_Plagiarism_in_Documents_Exploiting_Information_Sources","304997524_A_comprehensive_survey_on_formal_concept_analysis_its_research_trends_and_applications","341287659_A_New_Hybrid_Technique_for_Detection_of_Plagiarism_from_Text_Documents","323586700_Unmasking_text_plagiarism_using_syntactic-semantic_based_natural_language_processing_techniques_Comparisons_analysis_and_challenges","322351472_Fast_plagiarism_detection_based_on_simple_document_similarity","319022526_A_linguistic_treatment_for_automatic_external_plagiarism_detection","308826403_Investigating_the_impact_of_combined_similarity_metrics_and_POS_tagging_in_extrinsic_text_plagiarism_detection_system","301163966_Ahnlichkeit_als_Distanz_in_Begriffsverbanden","298546744_Formal_concept_analysis_as_mathematical_theory_of_concepts_and_concept_hierarchies"]}
