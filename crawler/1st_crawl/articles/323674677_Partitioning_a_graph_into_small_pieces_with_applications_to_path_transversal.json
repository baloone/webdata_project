(Formula presented.)-Edge Separator), where the goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices (resp. edges) such that each connected component in the resulting graph has less than k vertices. We also study (Formula presented.)-Path Transversal, where the goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices such that there is no simple path of length k. Our main results are the following improved approximation algorithms.(Formula presented.)-approximation algorithm for (Formula presented.)-Vertex Separator that runs in time (Formula presented.). It improves the simple k-approximation, and runs faster than the lower bound (Formula presented.) for exact algorithms assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) when (Formula presented.). We also prove that there is no (Formula presented.)-approximation algorithm that runs in time (Formula presented.) assuming the ETH.(Formula presented.)-approximation algorithm for (Formula presented.)-Edge Separator that runs in time (Formula presented.). It improves the best previous graph partitioning algorithm for small (Formula presented.).(Formula presented.)-approximation algorithm for (Formula presented.)-Path Transversal that runs in time (Formula presented.). Previously, the existence of an (Formula presented.)-approximation algorithm for fixed (Formula presented.) (even using (Formula presented.) time) was open.
