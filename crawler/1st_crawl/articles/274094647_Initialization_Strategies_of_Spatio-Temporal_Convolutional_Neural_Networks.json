{"id":"274094647_Initialization_Strategies_of_Spatio-Temporal_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We propose a new way of incorporating temporal information present in videos\ninto Spatial Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) trained on images, that\navoids training Spatio-Temporal ConvNets from scratch. We describe several\ninitializations of weights in 3D Convolutional Layers of Spatio-Temporal\nConvNet using 2D Convolutional Weights learned from ImageNet. We show that it\nis important to initialize 3D Convolutional Weights judiciously in order to\nlearn temporal representations of videos. We evaluate our methods on the\nUCF-101 dataset and demonstrate improvement over Spatial ConvNets.","authors":["Elman Mansimov","Nitish Srivastava","Ruslan Salakhutdinov"],"meta":["March 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319770438_Long-Term_Recurrent_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition_and_Description","273705018_Exploiting_Image-trained_CNN_Architectures_for_Unconstrained_Video_Classification","272423336_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Video_Representations_using_LSTMs","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","308860420_Beyond_Gaussian_Pyramid_Multi-skip_Feature_Stacking_for_action_recognition","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","269116104_C3D_Generic_Features_for_Video_Analysis","268820193_Beyond_Gaussian_Pyramid_Multi-skip_Feature_Stacking_for_Action_Recognition"]}
