{"id":"280912325_Improving_Decision_Analytics_with_Deep_Learning_The_Case_of_Financial_Disclosures","abstract":"Decision analytics commonly focuses on the text mining of financial news\nsources in order to provide managerial decision support and to predict stock\nmarket movements. Existing predictive frameworks almost exclusively apply\ntraditional machine learning methods, whereas recent research indicates that\ntraditional machine learning methods are not sufficiently capable of extracting\nsuitable features and capturing the non-linear nature of complex tasks. As a\nremedy, novel deep learning models aim to overcome this issue by extending\ntraditional neural network models with additional hidden layers. Indeed, deep\nlearning has been shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of\npredictive performance. In this paper, we adapt the novel deep learning\ntechnique to financial decision support. In this instance, we aim to predict\nthe direction of stock movements following financial disclosures. As a result,\nwe show how deep learning can outperform the accuracy of random forests as a\nbenchmark for machine learning by 5.66%.","authors":["Ralph Fehrer","Stefan Feuerriegel"],"meta":["August 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","31955014_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Decision_Support_Systems_Research","7327312_Competing_on_Analytics","314477032_Is_News_Sentiment_More_than_Just_Noise","301222516_Extended_Boolean_information_retrieval","288906520_Random_forests","287379657_News_or_Noise_How_News_Drives_Commodity_Prices","284679162_Business_Intelligence_and_Analytics_From_Big_Data_to_Big_Impact","284039049_Recursive_deep_models_for_semantic_compositionality_over_a_sentiment_treebank","279367818_Applied_Predictive_Modeling","279353497_Applied_Predictive_Modeling","274037232_Text_mining_for_market_prediction_A_systematic_review","263726795_Using_'Big_Data'_for_analytics_and_decision_support","254051649_Automated_News_Reading_Stock_Price_Prediction_Based_on_Financial_News_Using_Context-Specific_Features","251565065_Forecasting_in_Management_Science","228877499_Text_mining_systems_for_market_response_to_news_A_survey","228255520_Event_Study_Methodologies_in_Information_Systems_Research","224183837_Deep_Machine_Learning_-_A_New_Frontier_in_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_Research_Frontier","223693335_An_intraday_market_risk_management_approach_based_on_textual_analysis","222422983_Intraday_stock_price_effects_of_ad_hoc_disclosures_the_German_case","220893308_Data_Mining_meets_Decision_Making_a_Case_Study_Perspective","220890877_A_Text_Mining_Approach_to_Support_Intraday_Financial_Decision-Making","220426168_Business_applications_of_data_mining","215470760_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","208033762_Foundations_of_Statistical_Natural_Language_Processing","47405468_Twitter_Mood_Predicts_the_Stock_Market","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","4728645_Event_Studies_in_Economics_and_Finance","2529128_Currency_Exchange_Rate_Forecasting_from_News_Headlines"]}
