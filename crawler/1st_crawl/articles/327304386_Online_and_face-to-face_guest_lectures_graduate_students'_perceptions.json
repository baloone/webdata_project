{"id":"327304386_Online_and_face-to-face_guest_lectures_graduate_students'_perceptions","abstract":"Using guest lectures can provide graduate students with the opportunity to link theories with practice. This study aims to investigate perceptions towards online and face-to-face guest lectures among graduate students specialized in Curriculum and Instruction of Computer Science. Data was collected via reflection logs, semi-structured interviews and observations, revealing mainly positive experiences of both types of guest lecture. The participants acknowledged the flexibility and accessibility of an online guest lecture; on the other hand, they found that a face-to-face guest lecture facilitated better interaction and discussion. It is recommended to consider three issues for a successful guest lecture: guest speaker selection, teaching strategy of guest speaker and the role of the course lecturer. Future research based on identified gaps is recommended.","authors":["Reem A.
