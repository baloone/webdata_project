{"id":"223227606_Counterexample_to_a_conjecture_on_edge-coloured_tournaments","abstract":"We call the tournament T an m-coloured tournament if the arcs of T are coloured with m colours. In this paper we prove that for each n⩾6, there exists a 4-coloured tournament Tn of order n satisfying the two following conditions: (1) Tn does not contain C3 (the directed cycle of length 3, whose arcs are coloured with three distinct colours), and (2) Tn does not contain any vertex v such that for every other vertex x of Tn, there is a monochromatic directed path from x to v. This answers a question proposed by Shen Minggang in 1988.","authors":["Hortensia Galeana-Sánchez","Rocío Rojas-Monroy"],"meta":["May 2004Discrete Mathematics 282(1-3):275-276","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2003.11.015","SourceDBLP"],"references":["243788242_On_monochromatic_paths_in_m-coloured_tournaments","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs"]}
