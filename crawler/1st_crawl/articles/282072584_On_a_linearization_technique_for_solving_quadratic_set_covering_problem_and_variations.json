Arora, A Linearization technique for solving the Quadratic Set Covering\nProblem, Optimization, 39 (1997) 33-42. In particular, we observe that their\nalgorithm need not guarantee optimality, contrary to what is claimed.\nExperimental analysis with the algorithm has been carried out to evaluate its\nmerit as a heuristic and compared with CPLEX. The results disclose that for\nsome class of problems the algorithm is reasonably effective while for some\nother class, it's performance is very poor. we also discussion similar\ninaccuracies in another related paper.","authors":["Pooja Pandey","Abraham P.
