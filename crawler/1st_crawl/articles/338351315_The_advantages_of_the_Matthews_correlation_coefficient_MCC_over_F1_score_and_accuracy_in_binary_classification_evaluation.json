Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.\n\nResults: \nThe Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.\n\nConclusions: \nIn this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.","authors":["Davide Chicco","Giuseppe Jurman"],"meta":["January 2020BMC Genomics 21(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12864-019-6413-7"],"references":["336085238_Why_Cohen's_Kappa_should_be_avoided_as_performance_measure_in_classification","330377101_Enhancing_Confusion_Entropy_CEN_for_binary_and_multiclass_classification","330298818_Computational_prediction_of_diagnosis_and_feature_selection_on_mesothelioma_patient_health_records","329766457_Local_epigenomic_state_cannot_discriminate_interacting_and_non-interacting_enhancer-promoter_pairs_with_high_accuracy","329500075_Distillation_of_the_clinical_algorithm_improves_prognosis_by_multi-task_deep_learning_in_high-risk_Neuroblastoma","327148996_Classification_Assessment_Methods_a_detailed_tutorial","345676142_Virtual_ChIP-seq_predicting_transcription_factor_binding_by_learning_from_the_transcriptome","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","331638378_Evaluation_of_approximate_rank-order_clustering_using_matthews_correlation_coefficient","331402961_The_impact_of_class_imbalance_in_classification_performance_metrics_based_on_the_binary_confusion_matrix"]}
