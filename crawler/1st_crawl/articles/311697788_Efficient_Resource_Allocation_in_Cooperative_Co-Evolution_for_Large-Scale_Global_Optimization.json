{"id":"311697788_Efficient_Resource_Allocation_in_Cooperative_Co-Evolution_for_Large-Scale_Global_Optimization","abstract":"Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is an explicit means of problem decomposition in multipopulation evolutionary algorithms for solving large-scale optimization problems. For CC, subpopulations representing subcomponents of a large-scale optimization problem co-evolve, and are likely to have different contributions to the improvement of the best overall solution to the problem. Hence, it makes sense that more computational resources should be allocated to the subpopulations with greater contributions. In this paper, we study how to allocate computational resources in this context and subsequently propose a new CC framework named CCFR to efficiently allocate computational resources among the subpopulations according to their dynamic contributions to the improvement of the objective value of the best overall solution. Our experimental results suggest that CCFR can make efficient use of computational resources and is a highly competitive CCFR for solving large-scale optimization problems.","authors":["Ming Yang","Mohammmad Nabi Omidvar","Changhe Li","Xiaodong Li"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2016.2627581","Project: Cooperative Co-evolution Framework: CCFR"],"references":["309915353_Dynamic_Selection_of_Evolutionary_Operators_Based_on_Online_Learning_and_Fitness_Landscape_Analysis","284178898_A_Competitive_Divide-and-Conquer_Algorithm_for_Unconstrained_Large_Scale_Black-Box_Optimization","279952972_Effective_decomposition_of_large-scale_separable_continuous_functions_for_cooperative_co-evolutionary_algorithms","313606923_Sparse_dynamic_programming","313108693_Acooperative_coevolutionary_approach_to_function_optimization","309083849_Airfoil_and_wing_design_through_hybrid_optimization_strategies","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","277936716_A_comprehensive_comparison_of_large_scale_global_optimizers","277634558_Are_All_the_Subproblems_Equally_Important_Resource_Allocation_in_Decomposition_Based_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms","277142686_A_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Contribution-Based_Cooperative_Co-evolutionary_Algorithms","264537767_Differential_Evolution_With_Auto-Enhanced_Population_Diversity","276414276_Multi-population_differential_evolution_with_balanced_ensemble_of_mutation_strategies_for_large-scale_global_optimization","268804971_Improving_Differential_Evolution_With_a_Successful-Parent-Selecting_Framework","265834889_Evolutionary_Optimization"]}
