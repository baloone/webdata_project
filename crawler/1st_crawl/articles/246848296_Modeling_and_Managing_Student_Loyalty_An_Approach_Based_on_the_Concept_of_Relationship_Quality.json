{"id":"246848296_Modeling_and_Managing_Student_Loyalty_An_Approach_Based_on_the_Concept_of_Relationship_Quality","abstract":"The loyalty of customers is widely accepted as a critical factor in the long-term success of a service firm. In this ar- ticle, the authors develop a model of student loyalty by combining the growing body of knowledge on relationship marketing in the context of services with insights from more traditional educational research. Their relationship quality-based student loyalty (RQSL) model proposes that student loyalty is mainly determined by the dimensions of relationship quality. The model also includes students' in- tegration into the university system and external commit- ment as second-order factors. The authors test the RQSL model using the structural equation modeling approach and empirical data from a survey of several German uni- versities. Among other things, the results indicate that the quality of teaching and the students' emotional commit- ment to their institution are crucial for student loyalty. However, there are clear differences between the results obtained from different courses of study.","authors":["Thorsten Hennig-Thurau","Markus F.
