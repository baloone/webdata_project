{"id":"269417023_Distinguishing_Cause_from_Effect_Using_Observational_Data_Methods_and_Benchmarks","abstract":"The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a\nfundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal\ndiscovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes\nX, given joint observations of two variables X, Y . This was often considered\nto be impossible. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing this\nbivariate causal discovery problem were proposed recently. In this paper, we\npresent the benchmark data set CauseEffectPairs that consists of 88 different\n\"cause-effect pairs\" selected from 31 datasets from various domains. We\nevaluated the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on\nthese real-world benchmark data and on artificially simulated data. Our\nempirical results provide evidence that additive-noise methods are indeed able\nto distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data. In\naddition, we prove consistency of the additive-noise method proposed by Hoyer\net al. (2009).","authors":["Joris Mooij","Jonas Peters","Dominik Janzing","Jakob Zscheischler"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Machine Learning Research 17(32):1-102","SourcearXiv"],"references":["291448776_GNU_Parallel_-_The_Command-Line_Power_Tool","287546509_7he_Population_Biology_of_Abalone_Haliotis_species_in_Tasmania_I_Blacklip_Abalone_H_rubra_from_the_North_Coast_and_Islands_of_Bass_Strait","329654602_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","329471201_A_Test_for_Normality_Based_on_Sample_Entropy","318392852_The_Use_of_Confidence_or_Fiducial_Limits_Illustrated_in_the_Case_of_the_Binomial","308300968_Modern_Applied_Statistics_with_S","303269133_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","268245244_Toeplitz_and_circulant_matrices_a_review_Print_version_of_Foundations_and_Trends_in_Communications_and_Information_Theory_Vol_2_No_3_2005","266935279_Toeplitz_forms_and_their_applications_Teplicevy_formy_i_ich_prilozenija"]}
