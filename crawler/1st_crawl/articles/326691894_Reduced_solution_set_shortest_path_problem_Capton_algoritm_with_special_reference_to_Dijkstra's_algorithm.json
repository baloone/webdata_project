{"id":"326691894_Reduced_solution_set_shortest_path_problem_Capton_algoritm_with_special_reference_to_Dijkstra's_algorithm","abstract":"To find the shortest path between the nodes of a graph, Different algorithms like Bellman-FordDijkstraFloyd- Warshall and Johnson exist. However, in this paper, the issue of shortest path problem with special reference to Dijkstra's algorithm is presented. An idea of shortlisting the appropriate nodes in a graph is proposed and presented, which is then used to find the shortest path with the help of Dijkstra's algorithm. This complete work - named Capton algorithm- provides a solution to single source shortest path problem with minimized time complexity as compared to Dijkstra's algorithm.
