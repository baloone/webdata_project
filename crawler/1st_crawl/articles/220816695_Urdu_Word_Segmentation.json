{"id":"220816695_Urdu_Word_Segmentation","abstract":"Word Segmentation is the foremost obligatory task in almost all the NLP applications where the initial phase requires tokenization of input into words. Urdu is amongst the Asian languages that face word segmenta- tion challenge. However, unlike other Asian languages, word segmentation in Urdu not only has space omission errors but also space insertion errors. This paper dis- cusses how orthographic and linguistic features in Urdu trigger these two problems. It also discusses the work that has been done to tokenize input text. We employ a hybrid solution that performs an n-gram ranking on top of rule based maximum matching heuristic. Our best technique gives an error detection of 85.8% and over- all accuracy of 95.8%. Further issues and possible fu- ture directions are also discussed.","authors":["Nadir Durrani","Sarmad Hussain"],"meta":["January 2010","SourceDBLP","Conference: Human Language Technologies: Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics, Proceedings, June 2-4, 2010, Los Angeles, California, USA"],"references":["243659316_Word_segmentation_for_Thai_in_machine_translation_system","234804515_Letter-to-sound_conversion_for_Urdu_text-to-speech_system","228674840_Spelling_error_trends_in_Urdu","3786212_Feature-based_Thai_unknown_word_boundary_identification_using_Winnow","283363395_Written_Chinese_word_segmentation_system_-_CDWS","243777513_Automatic_Thai_Unknown_Word_Recognition","243777508_Dictionary-based_Thai_Syllable_Separation","238157657_A_hybrid_approach_to_unknown_word_detection_and_segmentation_of_Chinese","226161742_Empirical_Support_for_Winnow_and_Weighted-Majority_Algorithms_Results_on_a_Calendar_Scheduling_Domain","2602251_Srilm_---_An_Extensible_Language_Modeling_Toolkit"]}
