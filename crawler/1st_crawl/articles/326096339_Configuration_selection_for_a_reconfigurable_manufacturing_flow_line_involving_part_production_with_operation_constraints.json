{"id":"326096339_Configuration_selection_for_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_flow_line_involving_part_production_with_operation_constraints","abstract":"Configuration selection for reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) is one of the key issue that needs to be addressed to transform RMS implementation from its nascent stage to a mature one. The problem is of vital importance because of the fact that the selection of machine configurations for operations to be performed on any job/part is based on multiple objectives, which often conflicts each other. In the present work, a framework for configuration selection for a manufacturing flow line (MFL) is proposed and demonstrated using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The proposed framework is explained with the help of a mathematical illustration. Results are presented in the form of non-dominated solutions obtained for machine configurations encompassing manufacturing of a product using a multi-tage reconfigurable serial product flow line (RSPFL). The outcome of this work would help in improving the performance of RMSs while considering multiple objectives as the selection criterions. The findings are finally discussed in detail in the light of previous works on the topic.","authors":["Masood Ashraf","Faisal Hasan"],"meta":["September 2018The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 98(5-8)","DOI:10.1007/s00170-018-2361-7","Projects: Reconfigurable Manufacturing SystemsOptimal configuration selection for RMS."],"references":["311793017_A_COMPREHENSIVE_APPROACH_FOR_PART_FAMILY_FORMATION_USING_PRODUCTION_SIMILARITIES","311792864_Product_family_formation_for_RMS_-_A_review","311792773_Grouping_of_PartProduct_Variants_Based_on_Operation_Sequence_Similarity","311792693_Optimum_Allocation_of_Machines_with_Multiple_Objectives_using_NSGA-II","310537785_Modular_and_reconfigurable_desktop_microfactory_for_high_precision_manufacturing","306528781_A_study_on_the_use_of_advanced_manufacturing_technologies_by_manufacturing_firms_in_a_small_geographically_isolated_developed_economy_the_case_of_Malta","299513500_Product_family_formation_based_on_multiple_product_similarities_for_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","330356933_Multiple_attribute_decision_making_Methods_and_applications","320535429_Choosing_the_system_configuration_for_high-volume_manufacturing","300371299_Part_family_formation_using_skip_moves_and_lazy_machines_in_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","296787980_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_Systems_and_Transformable_Factories","294734424_Value_creation_through_design_for_scalability_of_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems","287705221_Multi-Objective_Optimal_Configuration_of_Reconfigurable_Test_Platform_A_Modified_Discrete_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Approach","282420803_Genetic_Modelling_for_Selecting_Optimal_Machine_Configurations_in_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_System","280769943_Prediction_of_machine_reconfigurability_using_artificial_neural_network_for_a_reconfigurable_serial_product_flow_line"]}
