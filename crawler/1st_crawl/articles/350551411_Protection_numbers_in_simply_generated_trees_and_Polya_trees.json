{"id":"350551411_Protection_numbers_in_simply_generated_trees_and_Polya_trees","abstract":"We determine the limit of the expected value and the variance of the protection number of the root in simply generated trees, in P?lya trees, and in unlabelled non-plane binary trees, when the number of vertices tends to infinity. Moreover, we compute expectation and variance of the protection number of a randomly chosen vertex in all those tree classes. We obtain exact formulas as sum representations, where the obtained sums are rapidly converging thus allowing an efficient numerical computation of high accuracy.","authors":["Bernhard Gittenberger","Zbigniew Gołębiewski","Isabella Larcher","Malgorzata Sulkowska"],"meta":["January 2021Applicable Analysis and Discrete Mathematics","DOI:10.2298/AADM190329010G"],"references":["313893529_Protection_Number_in_Plane_Trees","272845279_Scaling_limits_of_random_P'olya_trees","257299329_Protected_nodes_and_fringe_subtrees_in_some_random_trees","327596829_Cost_functionals_for_large_uniform_and_simply_generated_random_trees","276083687_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Protected_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","273339171_Limit_laws_for_functions_of_fringe_trees_for_binary_search_trees_and_random_recursive_trees","271897528_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Additive_Tree_Parameters_with_Small_Toll_Functions","269416899_On_a_random_search_tree_Asymptotic_enumeration_of_vertices_by_distance_from_leaves","267120942_Random_trees_An_interplay_between_combinatorics_and_probability","257294253_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_random_binary_search_trees","230805956_Protected_points_in_k-ary_trees","239030788_On_the_Altitude_of_Nodes_in_Random_Trees","225578539_Kombinatorische_Anzahlbestimmungen_fur_Gruppen_Graphen_und_Chemische_Verbindungen","222544163_The_Shape_of_Unlabeled_Rooted_Random_Trees","220533210_Singularity_Analysis_of_Generating_Functions"]}
