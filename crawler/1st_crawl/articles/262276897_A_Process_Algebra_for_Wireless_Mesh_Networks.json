{"id":"262276897_A_Process_Algebra_for_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","abstract":"We propose a process algebra for wireless mesh networks that combines novel\ntreatments of local broadcast, conditional unicast and data structures. In this\nframework, we model the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing\nprotocol and (dis)prove crucial properties such as loop freedom and packet\ndelivery.","authors":["Ansgar Fehnker","Rob van Glabbeek","Peter HÃ¶fner","Annabelle McIver"],"meta":["March 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-28869-2_15","Conference: Proceedings of the 21st European conference on Programming Languages and Systems","Project: FM for Wireless Network Protocols"],"references":["259483155_A_Process_Algebra_for_Wireless_Mesh_Networks_used_for_Modelling_Verifying_and_Analysing_AODV","256430321_A_calculus_of_broadcasting_systems","227019842_A_Process_Calculus_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","284602927_Ad_hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","268244970_Priority_in_Process_Algebra","251911576_The_proof_of_AODV_loop_freedom","235118354_An_Introduction_to_InputOutput_Automata_Revision","225735515_A_Calculus_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","224137053_Routing_Primitives_for_Wireless_Mesh_Networks_Design_Analysis_and_Experiments"]}
