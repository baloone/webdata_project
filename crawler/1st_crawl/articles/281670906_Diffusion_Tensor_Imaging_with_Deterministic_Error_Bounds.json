{"id":"281670906_Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging_with_Deterministic_Error_Bounds","abstract":"Errors in the data and the forward operator of an inverse problem can be\nhandily modelled using partial order in Banach lattices. We present some\nexisting results of the theory of regularisation in this novel framework, where\nerrors are represented as bounds by means of the appropriate partial order.\nWe apply the theory to Diffusion Tensor Imaging, where correct noise\nmodelling is challenging: it involves the Rician distribution and the nonlinear\nStejskal-Tanner equation. Linearisation of the latter in the statistical\nframework would complicate the noise model even further. We avoid this using\nthe error bounds approach, which preserves simple error structure under\nmonotone transformations.","authors":["Artur Gorokh","Yury Korolev","Tuomo Valkonen"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 56(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10851-016-0639-7","SourcearXiv","Project: Inverse Problems with Inaccurate Forward Models and Applications in Biomedical Imaging"],"references":["290519322_Adjugate_Diffusion_Tensors_for_Geodesic_Tractography_in_White_Matter","281395011_Bilevel_Parameter_Learning_for_Higher-Order_Total_Variation_Regularisation_Models","277958800_A_Second_Order_Non-Smooth_Variational_Model_for_Restoring_Manifold-Valued_Images","277075674_Automatic_Total_Generalized_Variation-Based_DTI_Rician_Denoising","344477911_Testing_Statistical_Hypotheses","316794441_Geometric_Measure_Theory","314735239_Testing_Statistical_Hypotheses","309571856_Bilevel_Parameter_Learning_for_Higher-Order_Total_Variation_Regularisation_Models","296694487_A_Novel_Riemannian_Metric_for_Geodesic_Tractography_in_DTI","279386281_Banach_Lattices_and_Positive_Operators"]}
