{"id":"305871010_Induced_Minor_Free_Graphs_Isomorphism_and_Clique-width","abstract":"Given two graphs G and H, we say that G contains H as an induced minor if a graph isomorphic to H can be obtained from G by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge contractions. We study the complexity of Graph Isomorphism on graphs that exclude a fixed graph as an induced minor. More precisely, we determine for every graph H that Graph Isomorphism is polynomial-time solvable on H-induced-minor-free graphs or that it is isomorphism complete. Additionally, we classify those graphs H for which H-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded clique-width. Those two results complement similar dichotomies for graphs that exclude a fixed graph as an induced subgraph, minor or subgraph.","authors":["RÃ©my Belmonte","Yota Otachi","Pascal Schweitzer"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53174-7_21","Conference: International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science"],"references":["287251089_Graph_Isomorphism_in_Quasipolynomial_Time","249386923_Width_Parameters_Beyond_Treewidth_and_their_Applications","221580450_Planar_Graph_Isomorphism_is_in_Log-Space","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220181029_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Some_Perfect_Graph_Classes","314133296_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Canonization_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","312167792_Graph_isomorphism_for_graph_classes_characterized_by_two_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","304890985_Clique-Width_of_Graph_Classes_Defined_by_Two_Forbidden_Induced_Subgraphs","302502264_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Rank_Width","302067893_Bounding_the_clique-width_of_H-free_split_graphs","283280119_Induced_minors_and_well-quasi-ordering","279369058_Isomorphism_of_Planar_Graphs_Working_Paper","276296047_Isomorphism_Testing_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Rank_Width","268079441_Towards_an_Isomorphism_Dichotomy_for_Hereditary_Graph_Classes","268020566_Isomorphism_on_Subgraph-Closed_Graph_Classes_A_Complexity_Dichotomy_and_Intermediate_Graph_Classes","262690520_Clique-Width_of_Graph_Classes_Defined_by_Two_Forbidden_Induced_Subgraphs","261369015_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Canonization_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","261217323_Reduction_Techniques_for_Graph_Isomorphism_in_the_Context_of_Width_Parameters","260428998_Classifying_the_Clique-Width_of_H-Free_Bipartite_Graphs","247265144_Problems_Polynomially_Equivalent_to_Graph_Isomorphism","242014484_Clique-width_and_edge_contraction","240904272_The_isomorphism_problem_for_classes_of_graphs_closed_under_contraction","240024329_Graph_Theory_Electronic_Edition_2000","230609740_Graph_Isomorphism_for_Graph_Classes_Characterized_by_Two_Forbidden_Induced_Subgraphs","229305506_On_graph_contractions_and_induced_minors","227929863_On_testing_isomorphism_of_permutation_graphs","227193226_The_complexity_of_induced_minors_and_related_problems","225128670_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs_in_Hereditary_Classes","225035759_Graph_Theory","222833707_Rank-width_and_vertex-minors","222434550_Approximating_clique-width_and_branch-width","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","221580715_Isomorphism_of_Planar_Graphs","221209576_Isomorphism_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Number","220995273_Graph_Isomorphism_is_in_the_Low_Hierarchy","220770635_Contraction_Bidimensionality_The_Accurate_Picture","220752980_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220618462_On_the_Relationship_Between_Clique-Width_and_Treewidth","220570000_Recent_developments_on_graphs_of_bounded_clique-width","220431912_A_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Deciding_Interval_Graph_Isomorphism","51952019_Structure_Theorem_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_with_ExcludedTopological_Subgraphs","2548600_On_the_Band-_Tree-_and_Clique-Width_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Vertex_Degree"]}
