{"id":"347092193_Life_cycle_assessment_and_comparative_exergoenvironmental_evaluation_of_a_micro-trigeneration_system","abstract":"The cascading use of energy distinguishes trigeneration systems from simple heat recovery strategies and conventional separate electric and thermal energy systems. Small-scale trigeneration is referred to as micro-trigeneration, and is a potentially sustainable energy solution. Despite the demonstrated benefits from economic, energy, and environmental perspectives, the adoption of micro-trigeneration systems has been undoubtedly underexplored in the tertiary sector. This study presents a detailed Life Cycle Assessment for a natural gas-fueled micro-trigeneration system, encompassing the equipment and energy flows. Two endpoint environmental assessment methods were employed, the Eco-indicator 99 and ReCiPe. The environmental data was utilized to develop exergoenvironmental assessments. The specific environmental impact for both methods, despite presenting different absolute values, show the same behavior. The highest environmental impacts are found at the internal combustion engine and steam generator. Regarding the evaluation of exergoenvironmental parameters, the absorber heat exchanger and steam generator should be the focus of improvement efforts. This study contributes to improving the understanding of which processes within a micro-trigeneration system contribute the most to exergy destruction and generation of environmental impacts.","authors":["Adriano Marques","Monica Carvalho","Alvaro Ochoa","Raphael Abrah√£o"],"meta":["November 2020Energy
