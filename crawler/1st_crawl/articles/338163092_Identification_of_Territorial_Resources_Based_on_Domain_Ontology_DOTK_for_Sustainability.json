{"id":"338163092_Identification_of_Territorial_Resources_Based_on_Domain_Ontology_DOTK_for_Sustainability","abstract":"Ontology is one of the useful tool that can explicit and represent the territorial knowledge for sustainability within industry. This research proposed a descriptive ontology for territorial knowledge (DOTK) which can help the sustainability and enhance the sustainable knowledge of actors of industries. Moreover, this ontology is applied in the specific territory to identify the intangible and tangible resources of this real case. In this way, it is proved that DOTK can act as a guide to identify the territorial resources which can assist the sustainability within industries.","authors":["Amer Ezoji","Matta Nada"],"meta":["December 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(13):683-688","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.132"],"references":["322692071_An_Ontology-Based_Knowledge_Modelling_for_a_Sustainability_Assessment_Domain","273064409_Inclusion_of_terrtorial_resources_i_the_product_development_process","228706578_Engagement_semantique_et_engagement_ontologique_conception_et_realisation_d'ontologies_en_ingenierie_des_connaissances","228674060_A_Comparison_of_Upper_Ontologies_Technical_Report_DISI-TR-06-21","225213719_Foundational_choices_in_DOLCE","327911393_How_Territorial_Knowledge_Effects_on_the_Sustainable_Development_within_Companies","326332955_DOLCE_Ergo_SUMO_On_Foundational_and_Domain_Models_in_the_SmartWeb_Integrated_Ontology_SWIntO","296271129_Governance_maturity_grid_A_transition_method_for_integrating_sustainability_into_companies","281500779_Le_territoire_comme_un_systeme_complexe_un_concept_operatoire_pour_l'amenagement_et_la_geographie","229027431_Online_Presentation_of_an_Upper_Ontology"]}
