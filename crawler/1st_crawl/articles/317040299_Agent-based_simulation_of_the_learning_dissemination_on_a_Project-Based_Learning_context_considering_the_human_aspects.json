{"id":"317040299_Agent-based_simulation_of_the_learning_dissemination_on_a_Project-Based_Learning_context_considering_the_human_aspects","abstract":"This work presents an agent-based simulation (ABS) of the active learning process in an Electrical Engineering course. In order to generate input data to the simulation, an active learning methodology developed especially for part-time degree courses, called Project-Based Learning Agile (PBLA), has been proposed and implemented at the Regional University of Blumenau (FURB), Brazil. Through the analysis of survey responses obtained over five consecutive semesters, using partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), it was possible to generate data parameters to use as an input in a hybrid kind of agent-based simulation known as PLS agent. The simulation of the scenario suggests that the learning occur faster when the student has higher levels of humanist's aspects as self-esteem, self-realization and cooperation.","authors":["Laio Oriel Seman","Romeu Hausmann","Eduardo Bezerra"],"meta":["May 2017IEEE Transactions on Education PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TE.2017.2754987"],"references":["328774079_Mesa_An_Agent-Based_Modeling_Framework","299347373_Statistical_Analysis_Using_PLS_of_a_Project-Based_Learning_Application_in_Electrical_Engineering","237136880_Rethinking_and_Redesigning_Curriculum_Instruction_and_Assessment_What_Contemporary_Research_and_Theory_Suggests","232430439_Intelligence_Knowns_and_Unknowns","225160925_Opening_the_'Black_Box'_of_Simulations_Increased_Transparency_and_Effective_Communication_Through_the_Systematic_Design_of_Experiments","1911890_Looking_Beyond_Content_Skill_Development_for_Engineers","309253979_Education_for_life_and_work_Developing_transferable_knowledge_and_skills_in_the_21st_century","308018952_An_assessment_of_the_use_of_partial_least_squares_structural_equation_modeling_in_marketing_research","303041063_The_PLS_agent_Predictive_modeling_with_PLS-SEM_and_agent-based_simulation","295830344_A_tool_for_supporting_the_design_of_DC-DC_converters_through_FPGA-based_control","289963904_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivations_Classic_definitions_and_new_directions","265620641_The_Agile_Manifesto","264409926_On_Becoming_a_21st_Century_Engineer","264409847_The_Human_Face_of_Engineering","260710885_Project-Based_Learning_in_Embedded_Systems_Education_Using_an_FPGA_Platform","260587269_Application_of_Project-Based_Learning_PBL_to_the_Teaching_of_Electrical_Power_Systems_Engineering","259683237_Context_and_Challenge_for_Twenty-First_Century_Engineering_Education","250763345_Rational_optimist","242376908_An_Introduction_to_The_Bootstrap","239066468_An_Open_Framework_for_Agent-based_Modeling","238162544_A_Review_of_Research_on_Project-Based_Learning","232472927_Toward_A_Psychology_of_Being","224574285_System-on-Chip_Design_and_Implementation","224148759_A_project-based_learning_approach_to_teaching_power_electronics_Difficulties_in_the_application_of_Project-Based_Learning_in_a_subject_of_Switching-Mode_Power_Supplies","220675729_An_Ill-Structured_PBL-Based_Microprocessor_Course_Without_Formal_Laboratory","220049076_An_Introduction_To_The_Bootstrap","215915914_The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society","200465482_The_Rise_of_Network_Society","44824164_Seven_complex_lessons_in_education_for_the_future","30859284_Engineering_for_a_Changing_World","3346353_Engineering_the_Information_Age","3052830_Project-Based_Lab_Teaching_for_Power_Electronics_and_Drives"]}
