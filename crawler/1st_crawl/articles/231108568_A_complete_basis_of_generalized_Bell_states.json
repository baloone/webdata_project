{"id":"231108568_A_complete_basis_of_generalized_Bell_states","abstract":"A generalization of the Bell states and Pauli matrices to dimensions which are powers of 2 is considered. A basis of maximally entangled multidimensional bipartite states (MEMBS) is chosen very similar to the standard Bell states and constructed of only symmetric and antisymmetric states. This special basis of MEMBS preserves all basic properties of the standard Bell states. We present a recursive and non-recursive method for the construction of MEMBS and discuss their properties. The antisymmetric MEMBS possess the property of rotationally invariant exclusive correlations which is a generalization of the rotational invariance of the antisymmetric singlet Bell state.","authors":["Denis Sych","Gerd Leuchs"],"meta":["January 2009New Journal of Physics 11(1):013006","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/11/1/013006"],"references":["228790513_Critical_error_rate_of_quantum-key-distribution_protocols_versus_the_size_and_dimensionality_of_the_quantum_alphabet","13243740_Maximal_violation_of_Bell_inequalities_for_mixed_states","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","235538324_Quantum_key_distribution_using_multilevel_encoding","231807293_Discussion_of_Probability_Relations_between_Separated_Systems","228109650_Quantum_Theory_Concepts_and_Methods","228109624_Quantum_mechanics_vs_local_realism_near_the_classical_limit_A_Bell_inequality_for_spin_s","200703048_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_Complete","23419107_Adaptive_estimation_of_qubits_by_symmetry_measurements","13385798_Quantum_states_with_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_correlations_admitting_a_hidden-variable_model"]}
