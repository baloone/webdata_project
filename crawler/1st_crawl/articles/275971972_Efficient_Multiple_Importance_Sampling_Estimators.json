{"id":"275971972_Efficient_Multiple_Importance_Sampling_Estimators","abstract":"Multiple importance sampling (MIS) methods use a set of proposal\ndistributions from which samples are drawn. Each sample is then assigned an\nimportance weight that can be obtained according to different strategies. This\nwork is motivated by the trade-off between variance reduction and computational\ncomplexity of the different approaches (classical vs. deterministic mixture)\navailable for the weight calculation. A new method that achieves an efficient\ncompromise between both factors is introduced in this paper. It is based on\nforming a partition of the set of proposal distributions and computing the\nweights accordingly. Computer simulations show the excellent performance of the\nassociated \\mbox{\\emph{partial deterministic mixture} MIS estimator.","authors":["VÃ­ctor Elvira","Luca Martino","David Luengo","Monica F.
