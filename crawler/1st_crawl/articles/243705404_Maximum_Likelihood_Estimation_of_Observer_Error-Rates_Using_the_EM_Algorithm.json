{"id":"243705404_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Observer_Error-Rates_Using_the_EM_Algorithm","abstract":"In compiling a patient record many facets are subject to errors of measurement. A model is presented which allows individual error-rates to be estimated for polytomous facets even when the patient's \"true\" response is not available. The EM algorithm is shown to provide a slow but sure way of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest. Some preliminary experience is reported and the limitations of the method are described.","authors":["Alexander Philip Dawid","A. M.
