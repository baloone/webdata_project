{"id":"319654149_ACTUALIZATION_OF_THE_MATHEMATICAL_COMPONENT_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_LESSONS","abstract":"This article discusses the type of the task of the USE in computer science with the point of view of the mathematical apparatus. When analyzing assignments, graphic and algebraic approaches are used to solve problems. Special attention is given in the article to the urgency of mathematical preparation in the question of the concept of the development of mathematical education in the Russian Federation. One of the purposes of the present concept is the popularization of mathematical knowledge and mathematical education, and the application of this knowledge in other fields. Implementation of the conception implies the conclusion of mathematical education to a new level, which will improve the teaching of other disciplines. In addition, it can be shown that the allocation of more attention to mathematics on other subjects makes it possible to improve the quality of education in computer science, in particular. The same concept helps to create and apply new mechanisms for the development of education, which can be used in other subjects. The purpose of this article is to attract the educational community (both teachers and students) to use more mathematical tools in solving tasks in computer science. The examples given in the article show that this approach makes it possible to solve problems more rationally and quickly.","authors":["I.N.
