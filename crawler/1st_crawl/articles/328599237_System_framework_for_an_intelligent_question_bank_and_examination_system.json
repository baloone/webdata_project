{"id":"328599237_System_framework_for_an_intelligent_question_bank_and_examination_system","abstract":"This documentary research purposed to design the System Framework for an intelligent question bank and examination system. It was divided into three periods: (1) the synthesis for functions in the question bank system; (2) design of the system framework for an intelligent question bank and examination system; (3) to evaluate the appropriateness of the system framework for an intelligent question bank and examination system. A content analysis was applied to analyze the data. The results found that: 1. The question bank system consisted of five modules: 1. User Management, 2. Question Management, 3. Examination Management, 4. Evaluation Management and 5. Scoring Management. 2. The system framework of the question bank system consisted of three parts: 1. Relevant persons for the question bank system: teachers, students, and administrators; 2. Framework of the question bank system consisted of five main modules and 15 sub-modules: 1. User Management: 1.1 Login, 1.2 Edit Profiles, 1.3 Set Permission. 2. Question Management: 2.1 Item Management, 2.2 Setting Item, 2.3 Classification Machine Learning. 3. Examination Management: 3.1 Setting Examination, 3.2 Monitoring Examination, 3.3 Select Item Machine Learning. 4. Evaluation Management: 4.1 Evaluation Examination, 4.2 Suggestions, 4.3 Prediction Machine Learning. 5. Scoring Management: 5.1 View Scores, 5.2 View Item Statistics, 5.3 Export Scores and 3.NUMBER? Cloud Computing. 3. The evaluation of the appropriateness of the intelligent question bank system and examination system was checked by five experts regarding the question bank system and machine learning. Statistics used in this research were the mean and standard deviation. The results found that the rate of this framework was in \"the most appropriate\" (overall mean was 4.70 and S.D. was 0.50.).
