{"id":"320409565_Immersive_Point_Cloud_Manipulation_for_Cultural_Heritage_Documentation","abstract":"A point cloud is the basic raw data obtained when digitizing cultural heritage sites or monuments with laser scans or photogrammetry. These data represent a rich and faithful record provided that they have adequate tools to exploit them. Their current analyses and visualizations on PC require software skills and can create ambiguities regarding the architectural dimensions. We propose a toolbox to explore and manipulate such data in an immersive environment, and to dynamically generate 2D cutting planes usable for CH documentation and reporting.","authors":["Jean-Baptiste Barreau","Ronan Gaugne","Valérie Gouranton"],"meta":["October 2017","Project: Conservatoire Numérique du Patrimoine Archéologique de l’Ouest"],"references":["282064465_Immersia_an_open_immersive_infrastructure_doing_archaeology_in_virtual_reality","271456174_The_West_Digital_Conservatory_of_Archaelogical_Heritage_Project"]}
