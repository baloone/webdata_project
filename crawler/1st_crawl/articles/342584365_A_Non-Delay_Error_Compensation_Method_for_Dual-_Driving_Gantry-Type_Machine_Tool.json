{"id":"342584365_A_Non-Delay_Error_Compensation_Method_for_Dual-_Driving_Gantry-Type_Machine_Tool","abstract":"The drive at the center of gravity (DCG) principle has been adopted in computer numerical control (CNC) machines and industrial robots that require heavy-duty and quick feeds. Using this principle requires accurate corrections of positioning errors. Conventional error compensation methods may cause vibrations and unstable control performances due to the delay between compensation and motor motion. This paper proposes a new method to reduce the positioning errors of the dual-driving gantry-type machine tool (DDGTMT), namely, a typical DCG-principle-based machine tool. An error prediction method is proposed to characterize errors online. An algorithm is proposed to quickly and accurately compensate the errors of the DDGTMT. Experiment results verify that the non-delay error compensation method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of the DDGTMT.","authors":["Qi Liu","Hong Lu","Xinbao Zhang","Yu Qiao"],"meta":["June 2020Processes 8(7):748","DOI:10.3390/pr8070748"],"references":["334493298_Multivariate_orthogonal_polynomial-based_positioning_error_modeling_and_active_compensation_of_dual-driven_feed_system","333504547_Simplifications_of_the_volumetric_error_model_because_of_the_structural_loop_of_machine_tools","333100312_A_volumetric_positioning_error_compensation_method_for_five-axis_machine_tools","333095558_Pre-compensation_of_servo_tracking_errors_through_data-based_reference_trajectory_modification","328232929_Two-Degree-Of-Freedom_Dynamic_Model-Based_Terminal_Sliding_Mode_Control_with_Observer_for_Dual-Driving_Feed_Stage","325536001_Study_on_mapping_rules_and_compensation_methods_of_cutting-force-induced_errors_and_process_machining_precision_in_gear_hobbing","322956818_Cross-coupled_fuzzy_logic_sliding_mode_control_of_dual-driving_feed_system","322648085_A_framework_for_a_large-scale_machine_tool_with_long_coarse_linear_axes_under_closed-loop_volumetric_error_compensation","334461524_Prediction_method_of_thermal_errors_of_the_screw_system_in_lathes_based_on_moving_thermal_network","321067214_Machining_error_decomposition_and_compensation_of_complicated_surfaces_by_EMD_method"]}
