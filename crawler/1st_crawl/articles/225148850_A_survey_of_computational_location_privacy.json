{"id":"225148850_A_survey_of_computational_location_privacy","abstract":"This is a literature survey of computational location privacy, meaning computation-based privacy mechanisms that treat location\ndata as geometric information. This definition includes privacy-preserving algorithms like anonymity and obfuscation as well\nas privacy-breaking algorithms that exploit the geometric nature of the data. The survey omits non-computational techniques\nlike manually inspecting geotagged photos, and it omits techniques like encryption or access control that treat location data\nas general symbols. The paper reviews studies of peoplesâ€™ attitudes about location privacy, computational threats on leaked\nlocation data, and computational countermeasures for mitigating these threats.","authors":["John Krumm"],"meta":["August 2009Personal and Ubiquitous Computing 13(6):391-399","DOI:10.1007/s00779-008-0212-5","SourceDBLP"],"references":["238301075_Privacy_Indexes_A_Survey_of_Westin's_Studies","229007416_Some_techniques_for_privacy_in_Ubicomp_and_context-aware_applications","228934814_Map_Matching_with_Travel_Time_Constraints","228614340_How_much_is_location_privacy_worth","228348484_Non-Inference_An_Information_Flow_Control_Model_for_Location-based_Services","226257893_Survey_on_Location_Privacy_in_Pervasive_Computing","225115844_Safeguarding_Location_Privacy_in_Wireless_Ad-Hoc_Networks","221609936_Preserving_privacy_in_GPS_traces_via_uncertainty-aware_path_cloaking","221607195_A_Spatiotemporal_Model_of_Strategies_and_Counter-Strategies_for_Location_Privacy_Protection","221607181_Project_Lachesis_Parsing_and_Modeling_Location_Histories","221600708_Simulation_of_Obfuscation_and_Negotiation_for_Location_Privacy","221568630_Control_Deception_and_Communication_Evaluating_the_Deployment_of_a_Location-Enhanced_Messaging_Service","221568594_Predestination_Inferring_Destinations_from_Partial_Trajectories","221519838_A_study_of_preferences_for_sharing_and_privacy","221342196_A_study_on_the_value_of_location_privacy","221335503_On_the_Anonymity_of_Periodic_Location_Samples","221331797_Anonymity_Unobservability_and_Pseudonymity_-_A_Proposal_for_Terminology","221310386_The_New_Casper_Query_Processing_for_Location_Services_without_Compromising_Privacy","221234537_Anonymous_Usage_of_Location-Based_Services_Through_Spatial_and_Temporal_Cloaking","221204676_Extracting_places_from_traces_of_locations","221015892_A_Formal_Model_of_Obfuscation_and_Negotiation_for_Location_Privacy","220815047_Inferring_Long-term_User_Properties_Based_on_Users'_Location_History","220267217_Geographic_location_tags_on_digital_images","220265912_PEPYS_Generating_Autobiographies_by_Automatic_Tracking","220141506_Starner_T_Using_GPS_to_learn_significant_locations_and_predict_movement_across_multiple_users_Personal_and_Ubiquitous_Computing_75_275-286","43138500_A_diary_study_of_rendezvousing_implications_for_position-aware_computing_and_communications_for_the_general_public","4795248_The_Economics_Of_Traffic_Congestion","4318557_Anonymous_Data_Collection_in_Sensor_Networks","4305180_A_Comparison_of_Spatial_Generalization_Algorithms_for_LBS_Privacy_Preservation","4294414_User-Controllable_Security_and_Privacy_for_Pervasive_Computing","313889417_User-controllable_security_and_privacy_for_pervasive_computing","312973479_Anonymous_usage_of_location-based_services_through_spatial_and_temporal_cloaking","279837045_Providing_lightweight_telepresence_in_mobile_communication_to_enhance_collaborative_living","270130293_Privacy_and_Freedom","263882456_ACHIEVING_k-ANONYMITY_PRIVACY_PROTECTION_USING_GENERALIZATION_AND_SUPPRESSION","246465638_Inferring_high-level_behavior_from","234459510_Multiple_Target_Tracking_With_Radar_Applications","228963718_Privacy_in_location-based_services_concern_vs_coolness","228686581_Route_Prediction_from_Trip_Observations","228356134_A_Markov_Model_for_Driver_Turn_Prediction","225524770_Location-Aware_Information_Delivery_withComMotion","221655560_Louis_Lester_and_Pierre_Three_Protocols_for_Location_Privacy","221568284_Learning_and_Recognizing_the_Places_We_Go","221253708_Privacy_Management_Mechanism_for_Location_based_Application_with_High_Performance","221038557_Protecting_Privacy_Against_Location-Based_Personal_Identification","221015951_Place_Lab_Device_Positioning_Using_Radio_Beacons_in_the_Wild","221015920_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Activity_Recognition_STAR_Using_Many_Anonymous_Binary_Sensors","221015883_Inference_Attacks_on_Location_Tracks","220141343_User_needs_for_location-aware_mobile_services","4305172_Protecting_Moving_Trajectories_with_Dummies","4230315_Protecting_Location_Privacy_Through_Path_Confusion","3437194_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Traffic-Monitoring_Systems","3436938_Stajano_F_Location_Privacy_in_Pervasive_Computing_IEEE_Pervasive_Computing_2_46-55","4173431_An_Anonymous_Communication_Technique_using_Dummies_for_Location-based_Services","2940296_Location-Based_Services_for_Mobile_Telephony_a_study_of"]}
