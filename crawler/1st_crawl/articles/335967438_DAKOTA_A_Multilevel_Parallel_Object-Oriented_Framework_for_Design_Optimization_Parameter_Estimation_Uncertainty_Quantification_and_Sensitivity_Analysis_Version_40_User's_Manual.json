{"id":"335967438_DAKOTA_A_Multilevel_Parallel_Object-Oriented_Framework_for_Design_Optimization_Parameter_Estimation_Uncertainty_Quantification_and_Sensitivity_Analysis_Version_40_User's_Manual","abstract":"The DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) toolkit provides a flexible and extensible interface between simulation codes and iterative analysis methods. DAKOTA contains algorithms for optimization with gradient and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, reliability, and stochastic finite element methods; parameter estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensi-tivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter study methods. These capabilities may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or optimization under uncertainty. By employing object-oriented design to implement abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems analyses, the DAKOTA toolkit provides a flexible and extensible problem-solving environment for design and performance analysis of computational models on high performance computers. This report serves as a user's manual for the DAKOTA software and provides capability overviews and procedures for software execution, as well as a variety of example studies. 4","authors":["Michael Scott Eldred","Anthony A Giunta","Shannon L Brown","Brian M Adams"],"meta":["October 2006","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.20773.45288","Report number: SAND2006-6337Affiliation: Sandia National Laboratories","Project: Numerical Optimization"],"references":["335967522_DAKOTA_A_Multilevel_Parallel_Object-Oriented_Framework_for_Design_Optimization_Parameter_Estimation_Uncertainty_Quantification_and_Sensitivity_Analysis_Version_40_Developers_Manual","335967434_DAKOTA_A_Multilevel_Parallel_Object-Oriented_Framework_for_Design_Optimization_Parameter_Estimation_Uncertainty_Quantification_and_Sensitivity_Analysis_Version_40_Reference_Manual","349091393_Navigating_Expensive_and_Complex_Design_Spaces_Using_Genetic_Algorithms","321133827_A_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Selecting_Values_of_Input_Variables_in_the_Analysis_of_Output_from_a_Computer_Code","314821184_Effective_two-point_function_approximation_for_design_optimization","313205295_New_adaptive_move-limit_management_strategy_for_approximate_optimization_Part_1","312897852_An_analysis_of_transformations","307534448_Response_Surface_Methodology_Process_and_Product_Optimization_Using_Designed_Experiments","306146157_Structural_reliability_under_combined_load_sequence","285327420_Structural_reliability_under_incomplete_information","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","275188793_Asymptotic_Approximations_for_Multinormal_Integrals","271644099_Introduction_To_Optimum_Design","269891688_Simple_Approximations_for_Improving_Second-Order_Reliability_Estimates","269224338_Multigrid_approach_to_the_optimization_of_systems_governed_by_differential_equations"]}
