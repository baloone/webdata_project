{"id":"330629851_Robust_Real-Time_Whole-Body_Motion_Retargeting_from_Human_to_Humanoid","abstract":"Transferring the motion from a human operator toa humanoid robot is a crucial step to enable robots to learn fromand replicate human movements. The ability to retarget in real-time whole-body motions that are challenging for the humanoidbalance is critical to enable human to humanoid teleoperation.In this work, we design a retargeting framework that allows therobot to replicate the motion of the human operator, acquiredby a wearable motion capture suit, while maintaining thewhole-body balance. We introduce some dynamic filter in theretargeting to forbid dangerous motions that can make the robotfall. We validate our approach through several experimentson the iCub robot, which has a significantly different bodystructure and size from the one of the human operator.","authors":["Luigi Penco","B.
