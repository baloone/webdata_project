{"id":"305805791_Self-assembly_of_fully_addressable_DNA_nanostructures_from_double_crossover_tiles","abstract":"DNA origami and single-stranded tile (SST) are two proven approaches to self-assemble finite-size complex DNA nanostructures. The construction elements appeared in structures from these two methods can also be found in multi-stranded DNA tiles such as double crossover tiles. Here we report the design and observation of four types of finite-size lattices with four different double crossover tiles, respectively, which, we believe, in terms of both complexity and robustness, will be rival to DNA origami and SST structures.","authors":["Wen Wang","Tong Lin","Suoyu Zhang","Tanxi Bai"],"meta":["August 2016Nucleic Acids Research 44(16):gkw670","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkw670"],"references":["291801654_Folding_DNA_to_create_nanoscale_shapes_and_patterns","267744296_DNA_Brick_Crystals_with_Prescribed_Depth","260367276_Numerical_Evidence_for_Nucleated_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Brick_Structures","295169929_Self-assembly_of_DNA_into_Nanoscale_Three-Dimensional_Shapes","294920320_Design_and_Synthesis_of_Triangulated_DNA_Origami_Trusses","280389197_DNA_rendering_of_polyhedral_meshes_at_the_nanoscale","280242556_Complex_wireframe_DNA_origami_nanostructures_with_multi-arm_junction_vertices","278096299_Two_computational_primitives_for_algorithmic_self-assembly_Copying_and_counting","261600839_Wireframe_and_Tensegrity_DNA_Nanostructures","258822617_Design_Space_for_Complex_DNA_Structures"]}
