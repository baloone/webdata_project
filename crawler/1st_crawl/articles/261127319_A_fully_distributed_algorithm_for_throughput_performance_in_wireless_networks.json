{"id":"261127319_A_fully_distributed_algorithm_for_throughput_performance_in_wireless_networks","abstract":"We study link scheduling in wireless networks under stochastic arrival processes of packets, and give an algorithm that achieves stability in the physical (SINR) interference model. The efficiency of such an algorithm is the fraction of the maximum feasible traffic that the algorithm can handle without queues growing indefinitely. Our algorithm achieves two important goals: (i) efficiency is independent of the size of the network, and (ii) the algorithm is fully distributed, i.e., individual nodes need no information about the overall network topology, not even local information.","authors":["Eyjólfur Ingi Ásgeirsson","Magnús M.
