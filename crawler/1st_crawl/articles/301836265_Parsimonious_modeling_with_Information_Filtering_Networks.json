{"id":"301836265_Parsimonious_modeling_with_Information_Filtering_Networks","abstract":"We introduce a methodology to construct sparse models from data by using information filtering networks as inference structure. This method is computationally very efficient and statistically robust because it is based {on} local, low-dimensional, inversions of the covariance matrix to generate a global sparse inverse. Compared with state-of-the-art methodologies such as lasso, our method is computationally more efficient producing in a fraction of computation time models that have equivalent or better performances but with a sparser and more meaningful inference structure. The local nature of this approach allow{s} dynamical partial updating when the properties of some variables change without the need of recomputing the whole model. We discuss performances with financial data and financial applications to prediction, stress testing and risk allocation.","authors":["Wolfram Barfuss","Guido Mario Previde Massara","Tiziana Di Matteo","Tomaso Aste"],"meta":["February 2016PHYSICAL REVIEW E 94(6)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.94.062306"],"references":["262983475_A_Gaussian_graphical_model_approach_to_climate_networks","254211576_High-dimensional_covariance_estimation_by_minimizing_-penalized_log-determinant_divergence","236185432_Spread_of_risk_across_financial_markets_Better_to_invest_in_the_peripheries","231119887_Correlation_structure_and_dynamics_in_volatile_markets","46462363_Hierarchical_Structure_in_Financial_Markets","7155656_Weak_pairwise_correlations_imply_strongly_correlated_network_states_in_a_neural_population","324339955_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Statistics","312443656_Covariance_selection","309301457_Compressed_Sensing_Electron_Tomography_Theory_and_Applications","286347219_The_Annals_of_Mathematical_Statistics","280230530_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_A_New_Way_of_Thinking_in_Financial_Modelling","279775041_Spartan_Gibbs_random_field_models_for_geostatistical_applications","273134799_Estimating_the_Dimension_of_a_Model","267125807_Coherent_stress_testing_A_Bayesian_approach_to_the_analysis_of_financial_stress","266476655_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","259142594_Markov_Random_Field_Modeling_Inference_Learning_in_Computer_Vision_Image_Understanding_A_Survey","258647193_A_new_type_of_climate_network_based_on_probabilistic_graphical_models_Results_of_boreal_winter_versus_summer","251335830_Dynamical_networks_from_correlations","245935349_Direct_Methods_for_Sparse_Linear_Systems","227604843_Zou_H_Hastie_T_Regularization_and_variable_selection_via_the_elastic_net_J_R_Statist_Soc_B_2005672301-20","224407538_Computationally_Efficient_Spatial_Interpolators_Based_on_Spartan_Spatial_Random_Fields","222812561_Modeling_by_shortest_data_description","220694854_Kernel_Methods_for_Pattern_Analysis","220024164_Information_Theory_and_Statistical_Mechanics_2","220022167_Information_Theory_and_Statistical_Mechanics_I"]}
