{"id":"280969769_Scheduling_Chained_Multiprocessor_Tasks_onto_Large_Multiprocessor_System","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed an effective approach for scheduling of\nmultiprocessor unit time tasks with chain precedence on to large multiprocessor\nsystem. The proposed longest chain maximum processor scheduling algorithm is\nproved to be optimal for uniform chains and monotone\n(non-increasing/non-decreasing) chains for both splitable and non-splitable\nmultiprocessor unit time tasks chain. Scheduling arbitrary chains of\nnon-splitable multiprocessor unit time tasks is proved to be NP-complete\nproblem. But scheduling arbitrary chains of splitable multiprocessor unit time\ntasks is still an open problem to be proved whether it is NP-complete or can be\nsolved in polynomial time. We have used three heuristics (a) maximum\ncriticality first, (b) longest chain maximum criticality first and (c) longest\nchain maximum processor first for scheduling of arbitrary chains. Also compared\nperformance of all three scheduling heuristics and found out that the proposed\nlongest chain maximum processor first performs better in most of the cases.","authors":["Tarun K.
