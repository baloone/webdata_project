{"id":"349739395_Electric_Vehicle_Route_Optimization_under_Time-Of-Use_Electricity_Pricing","abstract":"This paper addresses an electric vehicle routing problem with time window (E-VRPTW) under time-of-use (TOU) pricing where retail prices vary hour-by-hour to reflect changes in wholesale prices. The proposed solution aims to minimize the electricity-cost as well as traditional objectives: number of used vehicles and total travel distance. In particular, the proposed solution cleverly shifts battery charging to off-peak periods and adjusts the charging duration in order to reduce costs. First, the problem is carefully carved in a mixed integer linear programming model. Second, a constraint programming model is built. Third, a combined model is constructed to exploit the strengths of both models. The computational study based on the well-known benchmarking test instances demonstrates we can reduce the electricity cost by 3.1% on average while not compromising other objectives. We provides benchmarking instances and CPLEX source codes, in order to promote related-research, thus expediting the adoption of energy-efficient scheduling by autonomous taxi company.","authors":["Andy Myoungsoo Ham","Myoung-Ju Park"],"meta":["March 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063316"],"references":["342139631_A_Machine_Learning_Framework_to_Infer_Time-of-Use_of_Flexible_Loads_Resident_Behavior_Learning_for_Demand_Response","339012554_Logistic_Optimization_for_Multi_Depots_Loading_Capacitated_Electric_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_From_Low_Carbon_Perspective","337966514_Large-scale_energy-conscious_bi-objective_single-machine_batch_scheduling_under_time-of-use_electricity_tariffs_via_effective_iterative_heuristics","334775947_Electric_vehicle_routing_problem_with_single_or_multiple_recharges","332995939_A_Survey_on_the_Electric_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Variants_and_Solution_Approaches","341486591_A_Novel_Techno-Economic_Multi-Level_Optimization_in_Home-Microgrids_with_Coalition_Formation_Capability","337724050_Drone-Based_Material_Transfer_System_in_a_Robotic_Mobile_Fulfillment_Center","336186827_The_electric_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows_partial_recharges_and_satellite_customers","334518714_A_new_formulation_of_the_electric_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows_considering_concave_nonlinear_charging_function","332202286_Development_of_energy_consumption_optimization_model_for_the_electric_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows"]}
