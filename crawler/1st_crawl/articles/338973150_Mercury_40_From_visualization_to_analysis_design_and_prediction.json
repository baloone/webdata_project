{"id":"338973150_Mercury_40_From_visualization_to_analysis_design_and_prediction","abstract":"The program Mercury , developed at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, was originally designed primarily as a crystal structure visualization tool. Over the years the fields and scientific communities of chemical crystallography and crystal engineering have developed to require more advanced structural analysis software. Mercury has evolved alongside these scientific communities and is now a powerful analysis, design and prediction platform which goes a lot further than simple structure visualization.","authors":["Clare F.
