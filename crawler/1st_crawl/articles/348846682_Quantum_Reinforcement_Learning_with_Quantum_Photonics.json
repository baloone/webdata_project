{"id":"348846682_Quantum_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Quantum_Photonics","abstract":"Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising paradigm that could accelerate machine learning calculations. Inside this field, quantum reinforcement learning aims at designing and building quantum agents that may exchange information with their environment and adapt to it, with the aim of achieving some goal. Different quantum platforms have been considered for quantum machine learning and specifically for quantum reinforcement learning. Here, we review the field of quantum reinforcement learning and its implementation with quantum photonics. This quantum technology may enhance quantum computation and communication, as well as machine learning, via the fruitful marriage between these previously unrelated fields.","authors":["Lucas Lamata"],"meta":["January 2021Photonics 8(2):33","DOI:10.3390/photonics8020033"],"references":["346575836_Reinforcement_Learning_Decoders_for_Fault-Tolerant_Quantum_Computation","344859382_Machine_Learning_for_Long-Distance_Quantum_Communication","341764131_A_differentiable_programming_method_for_quantum_control","341761601_Quantum_machine_learning_and_quantum_biomimetics_A_perspective","341665355_Deep_Q-learning_decoder_for_depolarizing_noise_on_the_toric_code","341521374_Measurement-Based_Adaptation_Protocol_with_Quantum_Reinforcement_Learning_in_a_Rigetti_Quantum_Computer","341296297_A_reinforcement_learning_approach_for_quantum_state_engineering","348476338_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_to_Nonequilibrium_Quantum_Thermodynamics","345598040_Supervised_Learning_with_Quantum_Computers","342544008_Learning_to_Optimize_Variational_Quantum_Circuits_to_Solve_Combinatorial_Problems"]}
