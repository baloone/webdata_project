{"id":"326849523_Community_Structure_Detection_Using_Firefly_Algorithm","abstract":"This article describes how parallel to the continuous growth of the Internet, which allows people to share and collaborate more, social networks have become more attractive as a research topic in many different disciplines. Community structures are established upon interactions between people. Detection of these communities has become a popular topic in computer science. How to detect the communities is of great importance for understanding the organization and function of networks. Community detection is considered a variant of the graph partitioning problem which is NP-hard. In this article, the Firefly algorithm is used as an optimization algorithm to solve the community detection problem by maximizing the modularity measure. Firefly algorithm is a new Nature-inspired heuristic algorithm that proved its good performance in a variety of applications. Experimental results obtained from tests on real-life networks demonstrate that the authors' algorithm successfully detects the community structure.","authors":["Ameera Jaradat","Safa'a Bani Hamad"],"meta":["October 2018International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing 9(4):52-70","DOI:10.4018/IJAMC.2018100103"],"references":["305779642_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","287011000_Multiobjective_Firefly_Algorithm_for_Continuous_Optimization","277598076_A_Discrete_Bat_Algorithm_for_the_Community_Detection_Problem","333115533_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","313366372_Finding_and_evaluating_community_structure_in_networks_Phys","311707105_Metaheuristics_for_Big_Data","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","308295609_Metaheuristics_for_Big_Data","303858908_Community_detection_in_networks_Modularity_optimization_and_maximum_likelihood_are_equivalent","281491352_Is_Normalized_Mutual_Information_a_Fair_Measure_for_Comparing_Community_Detection_Methods"]}
