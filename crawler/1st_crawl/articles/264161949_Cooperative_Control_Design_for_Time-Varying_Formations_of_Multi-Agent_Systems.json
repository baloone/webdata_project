{"id":"264161949_Cooperative_Control_Design_for_Time-Varying_Formations_of_Multi-Agent_Systems","abstract":"This paper deals with cooperative control design for nonlinear multi-agent systems. The control objective is to ensure that a group of agents reaches a formation characterized by external time-varying parameters. First, a translation control design is presented to stabilize the multi-agent system to a circular motion tracking a time-varying center. Then, we propose a new framework based on affine transformations to extend previous results to more complex time-varying formations. Moreover, both control laws are improved adding a cooperative term to distribute the agents uniformly along the formation.","authors":["Lara Briñón-Arranz","Alexandre Seuret","Carlos Canudas-de-Wit"],"meta":["August 2014IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 59(8):2283-2288","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2014.2303213"],"references":["260686706_Collective_Motion_Sensor_Networks_and_Ocean_Sampling","228890606_Elastic_Formation_Control_Based_on_Affine_Transformations","224640595_Controlled_collective_motion_for_trajectory_tracking","224627386_Oscillator_Models_and_Collective_Motion_Splay_State_Stabilization_of_Self-Propelled_Particles","224220464_A_Distributed_Reconfigurable_Control_Law_for_Escorting_and_Patrolling_Missions_using_Teams_of_Unicycles","224162549_Source_Seeking_via_Collaborative_Measurements_by_a_Circular_Formation_of_Agents","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","271480776_Application_of_Remote_Sensing_Optical_Properties_of_Ship_Wakes_at_Sea_Area_out_of_Dalian_Harbor","267108978_Introduction_to_Computer_Graphics","261152425_Tracking_expanding_star_curves_using_guidance_vector_fields"]}
