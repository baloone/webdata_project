{"id":"275587932_A_Note_on_the_Rainbow_Connectivity_of_Tournaments","abstract":"An arc-coloured digraph $D$ is said to be \\emph{rainbow connected} if for\nevery two vertices $u$ and $v$ there is an $uv$-path all whose arcs have\ndifferent colours. The minimun number of colours required to make the digraph\nrainbow connected is called the \\emph{rainbow connection number} of $D$,\ndenoted $\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{rc}(D)$. In \\cite{Dorbec} it was showed that if\n$T$ is a strong tournament with $n\\geq 5$ vertices, then $2\\leq\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{rc}(T)\\leq n-1$; and that for every $n$ and $k$ such\nthat $3\\leq k\\leq n-1$, there exists a tournament $T$ on $n$ vertices such that\n$\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{rc}(T)=k$.\nIn this note it is showed that for any $n\\ge6$, there is a tournament $T$ of\n$n$ vertices such that $\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{rc}(T)=2$.","authors":["Jes√∫s Alva Samos","J.
