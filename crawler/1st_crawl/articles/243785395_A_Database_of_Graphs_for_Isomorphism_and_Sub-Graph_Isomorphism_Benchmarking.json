{"id":"243785395_A_Database_of_Graphs_for_Isomorphism_and_Sub-Graph_Isomorphism_Benchmarking","abstract":"Despite of the fact that graph based methods are gaining more and more popularity in different scientific areas, it has to be considered that the choice of an appropriate algorithm for a given application is still the most crucial task. The lack of a large database of graphs makes the task of comparing the performance of different graph matching algorithms difficult, and often the selection of an algorithm is made on the basis of a few experimental data available on it. In this paper we describe a database containing 72,800 couples of simple graphs especially devised for comparing the performance of isomorphism and graph-subgraph isomorphism algorithms. The 72,800 couples are split into 18,200 couples of isomorphic graphs and 54,600 couples of graphs with a sub- graph isomorphism mapping among them. The graphs include different categories as Randomly Connected Graphs, Regular Meshes (2D, 3D and 4D), Bounded Valence Graphs, Irregular Meshes and Irregular Bounded Valence Graphs. The size of the graphs ranges from few dozens to about 1000 nodes.","authors":["Pasquale Foggia","Carlo Sansone","Mario Vento"],"meta":[],"references":["224279054_Performance_evaluation_of_the_VF_graph_matching_algorithm","313638822_Efficient_attributed_graph_matching_and_its_application_to_image_analysis","263796310_PATTERN_RECOGNITION_BY_GRAPH_MATCHING-COMBINATORIAL_VERSUS_CONTINUOUS_OPTIMIZATION","234831436_An_Algorithm_for_Subgraph_Isomorphism","234827536_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Graph_Isomorphism","228854771_A_Performance_Comparison_of_Five_Algorithms_for_Graph_Isomorphism","222510396_Model_matching_in_robot_vision_by_subgraph_isomorphism","222442364_Isomorphism_of_bounded_valence_can_be_tested_in_polynomial_time","222275919_Introduction_to_graph_grammars_with_applications_to_semantic_networks","221356317_Efficient_Attributed_Graph_Matching_and_Its_Application_to_Image_Analysis"]}
