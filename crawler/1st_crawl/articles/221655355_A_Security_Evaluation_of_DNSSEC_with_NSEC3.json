{"id":"221655355_A_Security_Evaluation_of_DNSSEC_with_NSEC3","abstract":"Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence (NSEC3) are slated for adoption by important parts of the DNS hierar- chy, including the root zone, as a solution to vulnerabili- ties such as \"cache-poisoning\" attacks. We study the secu- rity goals and operation of DNSSEC/NSEC3 using Mur', a finite-state enumeration tool, to analyze security prop- erties that may be relevant to various deployment scenar- ios. Our systematic study reveals several subtleties and po- tential pitfalls that can be avoided by proper configuration choices, including resource records that may remain valid after the expiration of relevant signatures and potential in- sertion of forged names into a DNSSEC-enabled domain via the opt-out option. We demonstrate the exploitability of DNSSEC opt-out options in an enterprise setting by con- structing a browser cookie-stealing attack on a laboratory domain. Under recommended configuration settings, fur- ther Mur' model checking finds no vulnerabilities within our threat model, suggesting that DNSSEC with NSEC3 provides significant security benefits.","authors":["Jason Bau","John C.
