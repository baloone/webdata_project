{"id":"335567810_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENTS_AS_FOR_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TEACHING","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses are part of many Computer Sciences and Engineering\nmajors, and its learning process is challenging for both the students and teachers. In this\ncontext, the Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) can improve the teaching-learning process\non this issue. The VLE provide graphical and interactive scenarios that show solutions on\nvarious AI search problems, making the teaching-learning process becomes much more\nintuitive. Thus, this work proposes three VLEs to solve classical search problems: the\nTravelling Salesperson Problem, the Maze Problem and the N-Pieces Puzzle Problem. The\ndeveloped VLEs for these problems include the most famous search algorithms presented by\nthe literature, allowing the user not only to change the implemented algorithms code, but also\nto develop new algorithms and heuristics. By using these VLEs, the user can visualize the\nstep-by-step development of each solution, and compare the performance of the distinct\nalgorithms, their efficiency, completeness, among other parameters.","authors":["Ruy De Oliveira","Mario Anderson de Oliveira","Gabriela G Santos","Matheus C Teixeira"],"meta":["September 2019"],"references":["312491056_Analise_do_Desempenho_de_Algoritmos_Classicos_de_Busca_de_Caminho_em_Ambiente_de_Navegacao","265215573_Algoritmos_de_busca_em_tempo_real_aplicados_a_jogos_digitais","319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","290437107_Problem-based_learning_applied_to_the_artificial_intelligence_course","279311649_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Game_Artificial_Intelligence_Education_Using_Angry_Birds","273395655_ReAct_An_Interactive_Educational_Tool_for_AI_Planning_for_Robotics","271517893_Using_Semantic_Web_Technologies_in_a_Web_Based_System_for_Personalized_Learning_AI_Course","265374065_The_travelling-salesman_problem","260375727_INSOS-Educational_system_for_teaching_intelligent_systems","224363078_Maze_Solving_Algorithms_for_Micro_Mouse","215480946_Peer_Review_To_Improve_Artificial_Intelligence_Teaching","221603804_Large-Scale_Parallel_Breadth-First_Search","220045421_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing","3051021_Teaching_Introductory_Artificial_Intelligence_Using_a_Simple_Agent_Framework"]}
