{"id":"298716447_Using_SAT_solvers_in_large_scale_distributed_algebraic_attacks_against_low_entropy_keys","abstract":"In this paper we study large scale distributed algebraic attacks with SAT solvers in a specific scenarios. We are interested in the complexity of finding low entropy keys with the help of SAT solvers. Moreover, we examine how to efficiently distribute this process on multiple computing nodes. Finally, we show that the average cost of the attack per key decreases, if the attacker has access to many different encryptions with different keys.","authors":["Viliam Hromada","Ladislav Öllős","Pavol Zajac"],"meta":["September 2015Tatra Mountains Mathematical Publications 64(1):187-203","DOI:10.1515/tmmp-2015-0048"],"references":["268414490_Algebraic-Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES","266703704_Cryptanalysis_of_GOST_in_the_multiple-key_scenario","264277388_A_Comparison_of_Local_Reduction_and_SAT-Solver_Based_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_JH_And_Keccak","257619123_Local_reduction_and_the_algebraic_cryptanalysis_of_the_block_cipher_gost","221291741_Algebraic_side-channel_attacks_on_the_AES_Why_time_also_matters_in_DPA","220337181_Using_the_Cloud_to_Determine_Key_Strengths","220336724_Efficient_Methods_for_Conversion_and_Solution_of_Sparse_Systems_of_Low-Degree_Multivariate_Polynomials_over_GF2_via_SAT-Solvers","267080271_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_Present_Based_on_the_Method_of_Syllogisms","254044436_The_Science_of_Guessing_Analyzing_an_Anonymized_Corpus_of_70_Million_Passwords","242563585_On_the_Complexity_of_Derivation_in_Propositional_Calculus"]}
