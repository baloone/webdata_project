{"id":"261700950_Witness_structures_and_immediate_snapshot_complexes","abstract":"This paper deals with mathematics of immediate snapshot read/write shared\nmemory communication model. Specifically, we introduce and study combinatorial\nsimplicial complexes, called immediate snapshot complexes, which correspond to\nthe standard protocol complexes in that model.\nIn order to define the immediate snapshot complexes we need a~new\nmathematical object, which we call a witness structure. We develop the rigorous\nmathematical theory of witness structures and use it to prove several\ncombinatorial as well as topological properties of the immediate snapshot\ncomplexes.","authors":["Dmitry N.
