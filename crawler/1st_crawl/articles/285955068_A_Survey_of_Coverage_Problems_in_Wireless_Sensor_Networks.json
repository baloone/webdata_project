{"id":"285955068_A_Survey_of_Coverage_Problems_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Coverage problem is an important issue in wireless sensor networks, which has a great impact on the performance of wireless sensor networks. Given a sensor network, the coverage problem is to determine how well the sensing field is monitored or tracked by sensors. In this paper, we classify the coverage problem into three categories: area coverage, target coverage, and barrier coverage, give detailed description of different algorithms belong to these three categories. Moreover, we specify the advantages and disadvantages of the existing classic algorithms, which can give a useful direction in this area.","authors":["Liang Junbin","Ming LIU","Xiaoyan KUI"],"meta":["January 2014Sensors and Transducers 163(1):240-246"],"references":["263525099_Dynamic_Coverage_in_Ad-Hoc_Sensor_Networks_Algorithmic_Solutions_for_Wireless_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_and_Sensor_Networks_Guest_Editors_Amotz_Bar-Noy_Alan_A_Bertossi_Cristina_M_Pinotti_and_Cauligi_S_Raghavendra","258390199_Differential_Evolution_for_Lifetime_Maximization_of_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","344283816_The_Holes_problem_in_Wireless_Sensor_networks_A_survey","292080062_Multiple_targets_associated_coverage_algorithm_in_wireless_sensor_network","290947001_Density_control_algorithm_based_on_probability_coverage_model_in_wireless_sensor_networks","283633117_Coverage_analyses_of_plane_target_in_sensor_networks_based_on_clifford_algebra","278716512_An_adaptive_energy-efficient_area_coverage_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","272730128_Equitable_Direction_Optimizing_and_Node_Scheduling_for_Coverage_in_Directional_Sensor_Networks","271177168_Adaptive_Clustering_for_Maximizing_Network_Lifetime_and_Maintaining_Coverage","268995306_Analysis_of_the_multi-coverage_problem_in_wireless_sensor_networks"]}
