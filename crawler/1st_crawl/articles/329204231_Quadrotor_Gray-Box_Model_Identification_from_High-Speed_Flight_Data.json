{"id":"329204231_Quadrotor_Gray-Box_Model_Identification_from_High-Speed_Flight_Data","abstract":"To explore the aerodynamic effects on a quadrotor in the high-speed flight regime and establish an accurate\nnonlinear model, free-flight tests with a quadrotor are carried out in a large-scale wind tunnel. The flight data reveal\nthat complex aerodynamic interactions could appear and significantly influence the forces and moments acting on the\nquadrotor, which indicate the inaccuracy of state-of-art models established based on helicopter aerodynamic theory.\nTo cope with this problem, gray-box models considering these effects are identified from flight data using a stepwise\nsystem identification approach, which combines both prior knowledge of rotorcraft aerodynamic properties as well as\ndata observations. Previous models introduced in the literature are compared with the gray-box models. Validation\nresults show an 80% reduction of moment model residuals and a 20% reduction of force model residuals.","authors":["Sihao Sun","Coen De Visser","Q. P.
