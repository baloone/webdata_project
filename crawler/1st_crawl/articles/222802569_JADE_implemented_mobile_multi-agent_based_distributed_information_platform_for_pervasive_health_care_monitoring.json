{"id":"222802569_JADE_implemented_mobile_multi-agent_based_distributed_information_platform_for_pervasive_health_care_monitoring","abstract":"In this paper we aim to implement a highly distributed information infrastructure—MADIP by using Intelligent Agent paradigm, which is able to notify the responsible care-provider of abnormality automatically, offer distance medical advice, and perform continuous health monitoring for those who need it. To confront the issues of interoperability, scalability, and openness in heterogeneous e-health environments, a FIPA2000 standard compliant agent development platform—JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) was adopted for the design and implementation of the proposed intelligent multi-agent based MADIP system.","authors":["Chuan-Jun Su","Chia-Ying Wu"],"meta":["January 2011Applied Soft Computing 11(1):315-325","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2009.11.022","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262240868_SAgent_a_security_framework_for_JADE","253725124_Security_Measures_in_a_Medical_Multi-Agent_System","249956636_A_Security_Analysis_on_JADE-S_V_32","238684489_Mobile_Software_Agents_for_Network_Monitoring_and_Performance_Management","222709180_A_mobile_agent_platform_for_distributed_network_and_systems_management","221455604_An_open_agent_architecture_for_assisting_elder_independence","221450429_A_Multi-Agent_System_for_Organ_Transplant_Co-ordination","221204644_An_Agent_Architecture_for_Distributed_Medical_Care","220355911_Agent-based_approach_to_health_care_management","220308754_Provision_of_agent-based_health_care_services","220080056_A_domain-specific_software_architecture_for_a_class_of_intelligent_patient_monitoring_agents","8353158_WRAPIN_New_generation_health_search_engine_using_UMLS_knowledge_sources_for_MeSH_term_extraction_from_health_documentation","4071572_Multi-agent_system_architecture_for_heart_failure_management_in_a_home_care_environment","3760384_Coordinated_hospital_patient_scheduling","314721437_An_open_agent_architecture_for_assisting_elder_independence","250037464_Implementing_Mobile_Agent_Design_Patterns_in_the_JADE_framework","246573418_JADE_a_white_paper","244955453_A_domain-speci_c_software_architecture_for_a_class_of_intelligent_patient_monitoring_systems","232638265_Security_Support_for_Mobile_Grid_Services_Framework","224702399_Middileware_Interoperability_based_Mobile_Healthcare_System","223457913_Designing_strategy_for_multi-agent_system_based_large_structural_health_monitoring","223367616_An_evaluation_on_the_multi-agent_system_based_structural_health_monitoring_for_large_scale_structures","222425961_Intelligent_environment_for_monitoring_Alzheimer_patients_agent_technology_for_health_care","222415293_JADE_A_software_framework_for_developing_multi-agent_applications_Lessons_learned","221450619_Management_of_Hospital_Teams_for_Organ_Transplants_Using_Multi-Agent_Systems","221155353_A_Test_Suite_for_the_Evaluation_of_Mobile_Agent_Platform_Security","220391833_Building_software_agents_for_training_systems_A_case_study_on_radiotherapy_treatment_planning","41452828_Context_Awareness_in_a_Handheld_Exercise_Agent","13501676_MARVIN_multi-agent_softbot_to_retrieve_multilingual_medical_information_on_the_Web","12902580_A_framework_for_building_cooperative_software_agents_in_medical_applications_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Medicine_163_223-249","10828392_Formalizing_an_electronic_institution_for_the_distribution_of_human_tissues","4067076_Multi-agent_system_for_security_service","3876540_Patient_care_management_using_a_multi-agent_approach","2580215_Agents_In_Medical_Informatics","2283774_Software_Agents_A_Review"]}
