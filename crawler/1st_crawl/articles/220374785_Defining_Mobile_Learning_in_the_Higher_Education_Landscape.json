{"id":"220374785_Defining_Mobile_Learning_in_the_Higher_Education_Landscape","abstract":"The article seeks to clarify the meaning of mobile learning by applying its key concepts to learning experiences in post-school education. In other words, it seeks not to discuss one fixed meaning of mobile learning but to disassemble the basic components and provide an interpretation of the model in the context of higher education. The article argues that in order to comprehensively understand and define mobile learning, we should from the outset separate its key components and arrange them under three different concepts. The first concept relates to the mobility of the technology. The second concept hinges on increased learner mobility. The third concept examines the mobility and dynamism of the learning processes and the flow of information. The article concludes that knowledge in the modern world is transformed by the development of revolutionary technologies in society.
