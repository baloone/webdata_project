{"id":"275669345_Optimal_randomness_certification_in_the_quantum_steering_and_prepare-and-measure_scenarios","abstract":"Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of intrinsically random processes.\nContrary to classical randomness, this lack of predictability can not be\nattributed to ignorance or lack of control. Here we propose a method to\nquantify the amount of randomness that can be extracted in two scenarios: (i)\nthe quantum steering scenario, where two parties measure a bipartite system in\nan unknown state but one of them does not trust his measurement apparatus, and\n(ii) the prepare-and-measure scenario, where additionally the quantum state is\nknown. We use our methods to compute the maximal amount of local randomness\nthat can be certified by measuring systems subject to noise and losses and show\nthat randomness can be certified from a single measurement if and only if the\ndetectors used in the test have detection efficiency higher than 50%.","authors":["Elsa Passaro","Daniel Cavalcanti","Paul Skrzypczyk","Antonio Ac√≠n"],"meta":["April 2015New Journal of Physics 17(11)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/17/11/113010","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284717145_Full-field_implementation_of_a_perfect_eavesdropper_on_a_quantum_cryptography_system","281817324_Detection_of_entanglement_in_asymmetric_quantum_networks_and_multipartite_quantum_steering","270906128_Entanglement_steering_and_Bell_nonlocality_are_inequivalent_for_general_measurements","269997923_Multipartite_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_steering_and_genuine_tripartite_entanglement_with_optical_networks","263773579_Joint_Measurability_of_Generalized_Measurements_Implies_Classicality","290213681_Necessary_detection_efficiencies_for_secure_quantum_key_distribution_and_bound_randomness","272194656_Verifying_the_quantumness_of_a_channel_with_an_untrusted_device","270593963_Genuine_High-Order_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Steering","267734990_Joint_Measurability_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Steering_and_Bell_Nonlocality","261914888_Certifying_the_Dimension_of_Classical_and_Quantum_Systems_in_a_Prepare-and-Measure_Scenario_with_Independent_Devices"]}
