{"id":"335835961_Higher_Learning_Institute_Module_Organization_vis-a-vis_the_Criteria_of_Curriculum_Development_for_Problem_Solving_Skill_Development","abstract":"In this paper, an attempt is made to disclose the state of philosophy and the nature of curriculum development in Higher\nLearning Institutes (hereafter HLIs) of Ethiopia. This paper also tries to reflect on the existing literature on the different\nviews of authorities about the forms, values, and assumptions of using modules in HLI programs. Lastly, the theoretical\nframework for HLI module organization vis-à-vis the criteria of curriculum development for problem solving skill\ndevelopment is reviewed. The review is expected to benefit both decision makers at any educational level and\npractitioners in their attempt to bring the younger generation who passed through any higher learning institutes to\nteach the skill of ‘learning how to learn’ in this swiftly changing world. It is also of help for creating citizens who are well\nversed with the skill of problem solving which has been the vernacular of this nation since the inception of the current\neducation policy. It further shows the status of module organization in Ethiopian Higher Learning Institutes.","authors":["Solomon Mengistie"],"meta":["September 2019International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology 5(3):13-18"],"references":["274659165_Curriculum_A_Comprehensive_Introduction"]}
