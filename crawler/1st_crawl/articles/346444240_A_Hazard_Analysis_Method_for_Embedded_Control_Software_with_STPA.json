{"id":"346444240_A_Hazard_Analysis_Method_for_Embedded_Control_Software_with_STPA","abstract":"p>This paper proposes an analysis method for hazards that are occurred by interactions between hardware and software when using an apparatus installed an Embedded Control Software (EBSW). Hazard means a state that negatively affects the apparatus when some bad conditions are satisfied. Especially, the purpose of the method is clarifying the EBSW portions that cause the hazards. The outline of the proposed method is as follows; (1)Develop EBSW specifications written in Unified Modeling Language (UML) and accident information, (2) Conduct safety analysis (System-theoretic Process Analysis: STPA) by inputting EBSW specifications and accident information, and generate the list of hazards and hazard scenarios, (3) Develop sequence diagrams corresponding to the hazard scenarios, and clarify program portions (Hazard Causal Factor: HCF) that are causes of the hazards, and (4) Conduct Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and apply countermeasures to avoid occurrences of the hazards. As a result of applying this method to the sample EBSW, we can confirm that the safety EBSW is developed.</p","authors":["Masakazu Takahashi","Yunarso Anang","Yoshimich Watanabe"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.17352/tcsit.000029"],"references":["4001015_Automatic_synthesis_of_dynamic_fault_trees_from_UML_system_models","329654446_Engineering_a_Safer_World_Systems_Thinking_Applied_to_Safety","286119040_A_proposal_of_Fault_Tree_Analysis_for_control_programs","280940150_Engineering_a_Safer_World","260928097_A_Proposal_of_Operational_Risk_Management_Method_Using_FMEA_for_Drug_Manufacturing_Computerized_System","223926188_Enhancing_software_safety_by_fault_trees_Experiences_from_an_application_to_flight_critical_software","3189659_Analyzing_Software_Safety"]}
