Schools are usually afforded the freedom to deploy the AI-ALS that they prefer. However, even before artificial intelligence autonomously develops into artificial superintelligence in the future, it would be remiss to entirely leave the students to the AI-ALS without any independent oversight of the potential issues. For example, if the students score well in formative assessments within the AI-ALS but subsequently perform badly in paper-based post-tests, or if the relentless algorithm of a particular AI-ALS is suspected of causing undue stress for the students, they should be addressed by educational stakeholders. Policy makers and educational stakeholders should collaborate to analyze the data from multiple AI-ALS deployed in different schools to achieve strategic oversight. The current paper provides exemplars to illustrate how this future-ready strategic oversight could be implemented using an artificial intelligence-based Bayesian network software to analyze the data from five dissimilar AI-ALS, each deployed in a different school. Besides using descriptive analytics to reveal potential issues experienced by students within each AI-ALS, this human-centric AI-empowered approach also enables explainable predictive analytics of the studentsâ€™ learning outcomes in paper-based summative assessments after training is completed in each AI-ALS.","authors":["Mengleong How"],"meta":["July 2019Big Data and Cognitive Computing 3(3):46","DOI:10.3390/bdcc3030046"],"references":["334488565_Educing_AI-Thinking_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_Arts_and_Mathematics_STEAM_Education","333999095_Harnessing_Entropy_via_Predictive_Analytics_to_Optimize_Outcomes_in_the_Pedagogical_System_An_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Bayesian_Networks_Approach","333225707_Educational_Stakeholders'_Independent_Evaluation_of_an_Artificial_Intelligence-Enabled_Adaptive_Learning_System_Using_Bayesian_Network_Predictive_Simulations","333049260_AI_Governance_and_the_Policymaking_Process_Key_Considerations_for_Reducing_AI_Risk","333043563_Artificial_Intelligence_Smart_Classrooms_and_Online_Education_in_the_21st_Century_Implications_for_Human_Development","332374122_The_Supermoral_Singularity-AI_as_a_Fountain_of_Values","331241534_Global_Solutions_vs_Local_Solutions_for_the_AI_Safety_Problem","330180894_Beneficial_Artificial_Intelligence_Coordination_by_Means_of_a_Value_Sensitive_Design_Approach","329960580_Towards_AI_Welfare_Science_and_Policies","328734944_Super-Intelligent_Machine_Operations_in_Twenty-First-Century_Manufacturing_Industries_A_Boost_or_Doom_to_Political_and_Human_Development"]}
