{"id":"331036627_Pseudospectral_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Pendulum_Equations","abstract":"The article searched on mathematics and numerical solutions for the nonlinear pendulum (Chaotic pendulum). The numerical solution that was used for our research suitably the pseudospectral methods. With these equations, we studied and calculated on the interval [−1, 1], with boundary conditions already known. We used the software Mathematica 10.4 to calculate the results of the problems. \n\ny and l is the length of the pendulum. The fact that the pendulum is placed in a friction environment, the drag force on the pendulum is calculated accordance with the Stokes law and is propertied to the instantaneous velocity of the pendulum because of the environment has value friction the equation of motion (1) becomes d 2 dt 2 θ(t) = −v 2 sin θ(t) − α d dt θ(t), (2) and here by α is the coefficient of friction of the environment and show that is α > 0. To resist the friction, we need to add some external force, to simplified we choose the external periodic force and so the equation of motion becomes the equation: d 2 dt 2 θ(t) = −v 2 sin θ(t) − α d dt θ(t) + β cos(wt), (3) here β is amplitude and w is frequency. When α = 0 and then (3) becomes d 2 dt 2 θ(t) = −v 2 sin θ(t) + β cos(wt), (4) * leanhnhat@mail.ru c ⃝ Siberian Federal University.
