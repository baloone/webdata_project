{"id":"330635968_Research_on_a_Thangka_Image_Classification_Method_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machine","abstract":"As an art image, Thangka images have rich themes, various forms of expression, complex picture content and many layers of color representation. This paper mainly constructs a multi-core support vector machine (SVM) based on the information entropy feature-weighted radial basis kernel function. In this paper, the kernel function is optimized, and the feature reduction is performed by using the random forest feature selection algorithm with average accuracy degradation. Finally, the effective classification of the icon image and the mandala image in Thangka is realized. The research results provide support for the follow-up study of Thangka image annotation and retrieval.","authors":["Tiejun Wang","Weilan Wang"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence 33(2)","DOI:10.1142/S0218001419540302"],"references":["317496930_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification_A_Comprehensive_Review","307747289_Show_and_tell_A_neural_image_caption_generator","286840452_Graph_Characterization_from_Entropy_Component_Analysis","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","220244925_Impressionism_Expressionism_Surrealism_Automated_Recognition_of_Painters_and_Schools_of_Art","3322056_Image_processing_for_artist_identification","346944711_The_BP_Neural_Network_for_Improvement_of_Classification_Accuracy_in_Remote_Sensing_Image","320393043_Deep_Compression_on_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Artistic_Style_Transfer","317317531_Research_on_dynamic_energy_consumption-aware_task_scheduling_of_computing_resources_in_the_cloud_platform","312871660_GA-SVM_Algorithm_for_Improving_Land-Cover_Classification_Using_SAR_and_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Data","310738714_Research_of_Advanced_GTM_and_Its_Application_to_Gas-Oil_Reservoir_Identification","302631298_A_Personalized_Time-Sequence-Based_Book_Recommendation_Algorithm_for_Digital_Libraries","296676415_Perceptually-Inspired_Artistic_Genre_Identification_System_in_Digitized_Painting_Collections","275257817_Visual_feature_coding_for_image_classification_integrating_dictionary_structure","234163829_An_Ontology_Enhanced_Parallel_SVM_for_Scalable_Spam_Filter_Training","220644744_Recognizing_image_style_and_activities_in_video_using_local_features_and_naive_Bayes"]}
