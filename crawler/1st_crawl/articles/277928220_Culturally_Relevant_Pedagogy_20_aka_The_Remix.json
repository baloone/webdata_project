{"id":"277928220_Culturally_Relevant_Pedagogy_20_aka_The_Remix","abstract":"In this article, Ladson-Billings reflects on the history of her theory of culturally relevant pedagogy and the ways it has been used and misused since its inception. She argues for the importance of dynamic scholarship and suggests that it is time for a \"remix\" of her original theory: culturally sustaining pedagogy, as proposed by Paris (2012). Ladson-Billings discusses her work with the hip-hop and spoken word program First Wave as an example of how culturally sustaining pedagogy allows for a fluid understanding of culture, and a teaching practice that explicitly engages questions of equity and justice. Influenced by her experience with the First Wave program, Ladson-Billings welcomes the burgeoning literature on culturally sustaining pedagogy as a way to push forward her original goals of engaging critically in the cultural landscapes of classrooms and teacher education programs.","authors":["Gloria Ladson-Billings"],"meta":["April 2014Harvard Educational Review 84(1):74-84","DOI:10.17763/haer.84.1.p2rj131485484751"],"references":["247948482_The_Politics_of_Official_Knowledge_Does_a_National_Curriculum_Make_Sense","249400340_A_Movement_Against_and_Beyond_Boundaries_Politically_Relevant_Teaching_Among_African_American_Teachers","233152922_Like_lightning_in_a_bottle_Attempting_to_capture_the_pedagogical_excellence_of_successful_teachers_of_Black_students"]}
