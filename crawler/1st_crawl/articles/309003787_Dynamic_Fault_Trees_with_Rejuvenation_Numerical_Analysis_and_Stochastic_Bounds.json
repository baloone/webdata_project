{"id":"309003787_Dynamic_Fault_Trees_with_Rejuvenation_Numerical_Analysis_and_Stochastic_Bounds","abstract":"This paper presents an extension of a methodology that we have introduced recently to analyze Dynamic Fault Trees (DFT). The failure time distributions of the components are obtained from measurements leading to discrete failure time distributions. The gate outputs in a DFT are numerically analyzed from the input failure time distributions. This paper presents one major extension in which maintenance operations are considered such that some components are replaced by new ones to increase the availability of the system.","authors":["Jean Michel Fourneau","Nihal Pekergin"],"meta":["October 2016Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 327:27-47","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2016.09.022"],"references":["283883095_A_Numerical_Analysis_of_Dynamic_Fault_Trees_Based_on_Stochastic_Bounds","222817760_Dynamic_Fault_Tree_analysis_using_Monte_Carlo_simulation_in_probabilistic_safety_assessment","324384553_Probability_and_Statistics_with_Reliability_Queueing_and_Computer_Science_Applications","313390668_DFTSim_A_simulation_tool_for_extended_dynamic_fault_trees","309050332_DFTSim_a_simulation_tool_for_extended_dynamic_fault_trees_Spring_Simulation_Multiconference","281048917_Stochastic_Bounds_and_Histograms_for_Network_Performance_Analysis","276074725_Fault_tree_analysis_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_in_modeling_analysis_and_tools","275815118_Probability_and_Statistics_With_Reliability_Queuing_and_Computer_Science_Applications","264960784_Comparison_Methods_for_Stochastic_Models_and_Risks","246173691_Fault_Tree_Handbook_with_Aerospace_Applications_Draft"]}
