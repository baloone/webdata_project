{"id":"348323494_Self-regulated_learning_and_satisfaction_A_key_determinants_of_MOOC_success","abstract":"MOOC is an innovative method in modern education, particularly important for sharing of excellent educational resources worldwide. To realize the full potential of MOOC, we need to understand the factors influencing MOOC success. In this study a theoretical framework has been proposed by integrating a self-regulated learning theory and DeLone and McLean success model to investigate the determinants of successful MOOC. This study aimed to (1) examine the relationships between quality factors and satisfaction; self-regulated learning and (2) understand the role of satisfaction as a mediator of the quality factors /self-regulated learning relationships. Six hundred twenty-two structured questionnaires collected from undergraduate students in Malaysia. The subsequent analysis employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) revealed three main results: first, system quality has a positive impact on satisfaction; second, satisfaction and service quality have a positive impact on self-regulated learning; finally, system quality has an indirect effect on SRL via satisfaction. The findings provide by the study will guide MOOC designer and developer to formulate methods and strategies that could further improve the adoption of MOOC successfully.","authors":["Nour Awni Albelbisi","Ahmad Samed Al-Adwan","Akhmad Habibi"],"meta":["May 2021Education and Information Technologies 26(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-020-10404-z","Project: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) in Malaysia"],"references":["344127642_Systematic_Review_Of_A_Nationwide_Mooc_Initiative_In_Malaysian_Higher_Education_System","342245041_Investigating_the_drivers_and_barriers_to_MOOCs_adoption_The_perspective_of_TAM","340848026_Development_and_validation_of_the_MOOC_success_scale_MOOC-SS","338830117_A_MOOC_Taxonomy_Based_on_Classification_Schemes_of_MOOCs","335293361_Assessing_eLearning_Systems_Success_in_Nigeria_An_Application_of_the_DeLone_and_McLean_Information_Systems_Success_Model","334756512_Factors_Influencing_Learners'_Self_-Regulated_Learning_Skills_in_a_Massive_Open_Online_Course_MOOC_Environment","330121289_The_role_of_quality_factors_in_supporting_self-regulated_learning_SRL_skills_in_MOOC_environment","325302721_Mapping_the_Factors_Influencing_Success_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOC_in_Higher_Education","325200685_Factors_Affecting_MOOC_Usage_by_Students_in_Selected_Ghanaian_Universities","325901781_Gamification_A_Key_Determinant_of_Massive_Open_Online_Course_MOOC_Success","320654931_MOOC_Success_Factors_Proposal_of_an_Analysis_Framework","317343742_Examining_the_Relationship_Between_Overall_Quality_User_Satisfaction_and_Internet_Usage_An_Integrated_Individual_Technological_Organizational_and_Social_Perspective","317312014_Assessing_Self-Regulation_of_Learning_Dimensions_in_a_Stand-alone_MOOC_Platform","316002900_Learner_Satisfaction_with_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","314248660_Understanding_the_quality_factors_that_influence_the_continuance_intention_of_students_toward_participation_in_MOOCs"]}
