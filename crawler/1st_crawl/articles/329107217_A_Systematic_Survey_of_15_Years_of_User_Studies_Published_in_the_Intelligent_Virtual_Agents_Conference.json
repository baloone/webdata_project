{"id":"329107217_A_Systematic_Survey_of_15_Years_of_User_Studies_Published_in_the_Intelligent_Virtual_Agents_Conference","abstract":"The field of intelligent virtual agents (IVAs) has evolved immensely over the past 15 years, introducing new application opportunities in areas such as training, health care, and virtual assistants. In this survey paper, we provide a systematic review of the most influential user studies published in the IVA conference from 2001 to 2015 focusing on IVA development, human perception, and interactions. A total of 247 papers with 276 user studies have been classified and reviewed based on their contributions and impact. We identify the different areas of research and provide a summary of the papers with the highest impact. With the trends of past user studies and the current state of technology, we provide insights into future trends and research challenges.","authors":["Nahal Norouzi","Kangsoo Kim","Jason
