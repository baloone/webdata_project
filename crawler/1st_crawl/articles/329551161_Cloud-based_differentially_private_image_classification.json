{"id":"329551161_Cloud-based_differentially_private_image_classification","abstract":"In this paper, our aim is to design and develop an anonymous full-duplex image classification framework under Differential Privacy. We work under the assumption that both, the cloud and the querier are semi-trusted entities, thus their data should remain safe and confidential. That is, neither the querier nor the cloud should be able to link a particular individual from the other party to an image while maintaining, to a certain extent, suitable classification accuracy. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to transform sample images into anonymized vectors; differentially private synopsis of PCA vectors, and we ensure that the individuals in these vectors remain unidentifiable.","authors":["Elie Chicha","Bechara AL Bouna","Mohamed Nassar","Richard Chbeir"],"meta":["December 2018Wireless Networks","DOI:10.1007/s11276-018-1885-y"],"references":["322034092_Face_authentication_in_encrypted_domain_based_on_correlation_filters","318475367_K-NN_Classification_under_Homomorphic_Encryption_Application_on_a_Labeled_Eigen_Faces_Dataset","312908738_k-Nearest_Neighbors_From_Global_to_Local","317608755_Security_Issues_in_Cloud_Computing","312658082_Multi-Biometric_Template_Protection_Based_on_Homomorphic_Encryption","311488812_Differentially_Private_K-Means_Clustering","308061191_The_Algorithmic_Foundations_of_Differential_Privacy","307994858_Different_Image_Encryption_Techniques-Survey_and_Overview","286383018_Near-optimal_differentially_private_principal_components","285827412_Differential_privacy_33rd_international_colloquium_on_automata","280589882_Exploring_Privacy_Preservation_in_Outsourced_K-Nearest_Neighbors_with_Multiple_Data_Owners","275363962_Differentially_Private_k-Means_Clustering","229006003_Support_vector_machines_with_binary_tree_architecture_for_multi-class_classification","284219627_Wishart_Mechanism_for_Differentially_Private_Principal_Components_Analysis","266607038_A_First_Course_in_Numerical_Methods"]}
