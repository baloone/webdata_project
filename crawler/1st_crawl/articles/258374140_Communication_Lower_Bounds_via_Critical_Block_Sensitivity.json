{"id":"258374140_Communication_Lower_Bounds_via_Critical_Block_Sensitivity","abstract":"We use critical block sensitivity, a new complexity measure introduced by Huynh and Nordström (STOC 2012), to study the communication complexity of search problems. To begin, we give a simple new proof of the following central result of Huynh and Nordström: if S is a search problem with critical block sensitivity b, then every randomised two-party protocol solving a certain two-party lift of S requires Ω(b) bits of communication. Besides simplicity, our proof has the advantage of generalising to the multi-party setting. We combine these results with new critical block sensitivity lower bounds for Tseitin and Pebbling search problems to obtain the following applications.\n• Monotone circuit depth: We exhibit a monotone function on n variables whose monotone circuits require depth Ω(n/log n); previously, a bound of Ω(√n was known (Raz and Wigderson, JACM 1992). Moreover, we prove a tight Θ(√n) monotone depth bound for a function in monotone P. This implies an average-case hierarchy theorem within monotone P similar to a result of Filmus et al. (FOCS 2013).\n• Proof complexity: We prove new rank lower bounds as well as obtain the first length--space lower bounds for semi-algebraic proof systems, including Lovász--Schrijver and Lasserre (SOS) systems. In particular, these results extend and simplify the works of Beame et al. (SICOMP 2007) and Huynh and Nordström.","authors":["Mika Göös","Toniann Pitassi"],"meta":["November 2013Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/2591796.2591838","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261054351_Average_Case_Lower_Bounds_for_Monotone_Switching_Networks","247330407_Random_Walks_on_Graphs_A_Survey_Combinatorics_Paul_Erdos_is_Eighty","242371169_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","230872913_Outline_of_an_Algorithm_for_Integer_Solutions_to_Linear_Programs","227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","221590478_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","220618173_Communication_Complexity_of_Simultaneous_Messages","220533721_Search_Problems_in_the_Decision_Tree_Model","220532929_Monotone_Circuits_for_Connectivity_Require_Super-Logarithmic_Depth","220532729_A_Hierarchy_of_Relaxations_Between_the_Continuous_and_Convex_Hull_Representations_for_Zero-One_Programming_Problems","266445265_Communication_Networks","265764648_Some_trade-off_results_for_polynomial_calculus","265374798_Algorithms_and_Computation_20th_International_Symposium_ISAAC_2009_Honolulu_Hawaii_USA_December_16-18_2009_Proceedings","265333503_Random_Walks_on_Graphs_A_Survey","262410755_Communication_Lower_Bounds_Using_Directional_Derivatives","249316467_Pebble_Games_Proof_Complexity_and_Time-Space_Trade-offs","242608674_On_minimal_models_for_secure_computation","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","239761523_Tight_bounds_for_monotone_switching_networks_via_fourier_analysis","239761513_On_the_virtue_of_succinct_proofs_Amplifying_communication_complexity_hardness_to_time-space_trade-offs_in_proof_complexity","238720626_Integer_Programming_and_Combinatorial_Optimization_8th_International_IPCO_Conference_Utrecht_The_Netherlands_June_13-15_2001_Proceedings","236871631_A_Tight_Bound_for_Set_Disjointness_in_the_Message-Passing_Model","233282306_Approximability_and_proof_complexity","228057650_Multiparty_Protocols_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Logspace_and_Time-Space_Trade-offs","225135552_Efficient_Multi-party_Computation_over_Rings","224354145_Linear_Level_Lasserre_Lower_Bounds_for_Certain_k-CSPs","222757593_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","222569158_Complexity_measures_and_decision_tree_complexity_A_survey","222475748_A_simple_lower_bound_for_monotone_clique_using_a_communication_game","222450604_Bounded-width_polynomial-size_branching_programs_recognize_exactly_those_languages_in_NC1","222439046_Probabilistic_Encryption","222431754_An_Information_Statistics_Approach_to_Data_Stream_and_Communication_Complexity","222419630_Edmonds_polytopes_and_a_hierarchy_of_combinatorial_problems","222289867_On_the_Distributional_Complexity_of_Disjointness","222288962_An_observation_on_time-storage_trade_off","221591793_A_minimal_model_for_secure_computation_extended_abstract","221591039_Multi-Party_Protocols","221590794_Integrality_gaps_for_Sherali-Adams_relaxations","221590685_CSP_gaps_and_reductions_in_the_Lasserre_hierarchy","221590339_Towards_Optimal_Simulations_of_Formulas_by_Bounded-Width_Programs","221543821_On_the_Tightness_of_the_Buhrman-Cleve-Wigderson_Simulation","221316747_An_Explicit_Exact_SDP_Relaxation_for_Nonlinear_0-1_Programs","220994857_Asymptotically_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_on_the_NIH-Multi-Party_Information_Complexity_of_the_AND-Function_and_Disjointness","220779924_Optimal_Construction_of_Edge-Disjoint_Paths_in_Random_Regular_Graphs","220690121_Communication_Complexity","220618028_The_Pattern_Matrix_Method","220617668_Lower_Bounds_for_Lovasz-Schrijver_Systems_and_Beyond_Follow_from_Multiparty_Communication_Complexity","220617506_Integrality_Gaps_of_2-o1_for_Vertex_Cover_SDPs_in_the_Lova-acutesz--Schrijver_Hierarchy","220555854_The_story_of_set_disjointness","220533834_The_Probabilistic_Communication_Complexity_of_Set_Intersection","220441716_Ramanujan_Graphs","220138751_Time-Space_Tradeoffs_in_Resolution_Superpolynomial_Lower_Bounds_for_Superlinear_Space","220430535_Hard_examples_for_Resolution","220138931_A_Linear_Round_Lower_Bound_for_Lovasz-Schrijver_SDP_Relaxations_of_Vertex_Cover","220138378_CSP_Gaps_and_Reductions_in_the_Lasserre_Hierarchy"]}
