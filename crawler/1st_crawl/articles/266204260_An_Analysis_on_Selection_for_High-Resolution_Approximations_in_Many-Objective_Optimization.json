Several search-assessment indicators are defined to trace\nthe dynamics of survival selection and measure the ability to simultaneously\nkeep optimal solutions and discover new ones under different population sizes,\nset as a fraction of the size of the Pareto optimal set.","authors":["Hernan Eduardo Aguirre","Arnaud Liefooghe","Sebastien Verel","Kiyoshi Tanaka"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10762-2_48","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature"],"references":["317219370_A_fast_elitist_non-dominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_for_multi-objective_optimization_NSGA-II","290742100_Adaptive_e-Sampling_and_e-Hood_for_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization","221883565_Borg_An_Auto-Adaptive_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Computing_Framework","216457303_Indicator-Based_Selection_in_Multiobjective_Search","216300535_A_fast_elitist_non-dominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_for_multi-objective_optimization_NSGA-II","4089892_Insights_on_properties_of_multiobjective_MNK-landscapes","2523573_A_Fast_Elitist_Non-dominated_Sorting_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multi-objective_Optimization_NSGA-II"]}
