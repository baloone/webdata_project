{"id":"356259604_A_novel_aerial_manipulator_system_compensation_control_based_on_ADRC_and_backstepping","abstract":"This paper proposes a fully-actuated control method for a novel aerial manipulation system (AMS). A customized carbon frame structure supports the servo actuators, on which eight propellers group into pairs located. We present kinematics and dynamics modeling of the AMS based on Craig parameter method and recursive Newton–Euler equation, respectively. Then, an Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC)—Backstepping—Compensation controller is designed to control the exact position and orientation of the manipulator in the Cartesian space. Finally, the performance of the system is demonstrated through simulations and virtual experiments.","authors":["Le Ma","Yiming Yan","Zhiwei Li","Jie Liu"],"meta":["November 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-01628-1"],"references":["323328890_Aerial_Manipulation_A_Literature_Review","321874484_A_Novel_Robotic_Platform_for_Aerial_Manipulation_Using_Quadrotors_as_Rotating_Thrust_Generators","318964469_A_Hierarchical_Learning_Control_Framework_for_an_Aerial_Manipulation_System","314229874_A_New_6-DOF_Quadrotor_Manipulation_System_Design_Kinematics_Dynamics_and_Control","286805558_Adaptive_control_for_UAVs_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","332063495_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation_of_a_Neural_Network_Based_Quadcopter_UAV_System","327673368_Design_modeling_and_dynamic_compensation_control_of_fully-actuated_aerial_manipulator","320255366_Dexterous_Aerial_Robots-Mobile_Manipulation_Using_Unmanned_Aerial_Systems","315119831_Uncalibrated_Visual_Servo_for_Unmanned_Aerial_Manipulation","301435490_Adaptive_Control_for_UAVs_Equipped_with_a_Robotic_Arm","280310678_Modeling_Control_and_Design_Optimization_for_a_Fully-actuated_Hexarotor_Aerial_Vehicle_with_Tilted_Propellers","272819834_Mechanical_Design_Modelling_and_Control_of_a_Novel_Aerial_Manipulator","286679659_Dynamics_and_control_of_quadrotor_with_robotic_manipulator","283801421_Operating_an_unknown_drawer_using_an_aerial_manipulator","273393262_Stability_of_Helicopters_in_Compliant_Contact_Under_PD-PID_Control"]}
