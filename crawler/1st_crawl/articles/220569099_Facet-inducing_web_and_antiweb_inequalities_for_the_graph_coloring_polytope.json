{"id":"220569099_Facet-inducing_web_and_antiweb_inequalities_for_the_graph_coloring_polytope","abstract":"For a graph G and its complement (G) over bar, we define the graph coloring polytope P(G) to be the convex hull of the incidence vectors of star partitions of (G) over bar. We examine inequalities whose support graphs are webs and antiwebs appearing as induced subgraphs in G. We show that loran antiweb (w) over bar in G the corresponding inequality is facet-inducing for P(G) if and only if (w) over bar is critical with respect to vertex colorings. An analogous result is also proved for the web inequalities.","authors":["Gintaras Palubeckis"],"meta":["November 2010Discrete Applied Mathematics 158(18):2075-2080","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2010.08.016","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220589310_Exploring_the_Relationship_Between_Max-Cut_and_Stable_Set_Relaxations","220441760_The_stable_set_polytope_of_quasi-line_graphs","29613785_Almost_all_webs_are_not_rank-perfect","287594441_On_the_graph_coloring_polytope","266421276_Special_issue_Workshop_on_discrete_optimization_DO'_99_Surveys_on_the_State_of_the_Art_RUTCOR_-_Rutgers_Univ_Center_for_Operations_Research_Piscataway_NJ_USA_Summer_1999","251146468_A_Polyhedral_Approach_for_Graph_Coloring1","222984416_A_Class_of_Facet_Producing_Graphs_for_Vertex_Packing_Polyhedra","222686598_Pseudo-Boolean_Optimization","222546097_Clique_family_inequalities_for_the_stable_set_polytope_of_quasi-line_graphs","222430784_A_construction_for_non-rank_facets_of_stable_set_polytopes_of_webs","220589305_Clique-circulants_and_the_stable_set_polytope_of_fuzzy_circular_interval_graphs","220569668_On_the_asymmetric_representatives_formulation_for_the_vertex_coloring_problem","220568600_A_class_of_web-based_facets_for_the_generalized_vertex_packing_problem","220567979_On_packing_and_covering_polyhedra_of_consecutive_ones_circulant_clutters","220461332_Facets_of_the_Graph_Coloring_Polytope","220090627_Set_covering_and_packing_formulations_of_graph_coloring_Algorithms_and_first_polyhedral_results","220081922_On_the_asymmetric_representatives_formulation_for_the_vertex_coloring_problem","216877631_New_0-1_integer_formulations_of_the_graph_coloring_problem","216877618_On_the_Facet-Inducing_Antiweb-Wheel_Inequalities_for_Stable_Set_Polytopes","213877008_On_the_recursive_largest_first_algorithm_for_graph_colouring","47723895_Clique-connecting_forest_and_stable_set_polytopes","46787899_A_one-to-one_correspondence_between_colorings_and_stable_sets"]}
