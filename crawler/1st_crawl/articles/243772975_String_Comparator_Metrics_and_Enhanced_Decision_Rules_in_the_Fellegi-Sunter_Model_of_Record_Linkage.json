{"id":"243772975_String_Comparator_Metrics_and_Enhanced_Decision_Rules_in_the_Fellegi-Sunter_Model_of_Record_Linkage","abstract":"This paper describes a string comparator metric that partially accounts for typographical variation in strings such as first name or surname, decision rules that utilize the string comparator, and improvements in empirical matching results. The string comparators are used in production computer matching software during the Post Enumeration Survey for the 1990 Census. The Post Enumeration Survey will use capture/recapture and other statistical techniques to produce a set of adjusted Census cotmts.","authors":["William E.
