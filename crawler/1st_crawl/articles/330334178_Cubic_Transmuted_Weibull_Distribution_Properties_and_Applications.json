{"id":"330334178_Cubic_Transmuted_Weibull_Distribution_Properties_and_Applications","abstract":"In this paper, a cubic transmuted Weibull ( CTW ) distribution has been proposed by using the general family of transmuted distributions introduced by Rahman et al. (Pak J Stat Oper Res 14:451â€“469, 2018). We have explored the proposed CTW distribution in details and have studied its statistical properties as well. The parameter estimation and inference procedure for the proposed distribution have been discussed. We have conducted a simulation study to observe the performance of estimation technique. Finally, we have considered two real-life data sets to investigate the practicality of proposed CTW distribution.","authors":["Md.
