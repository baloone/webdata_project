{"id":"221489251_The_ESTER_phase_II_evaluation_campaign_for_the_rich_transcription_of_French_broadcast_news","abstract":"This paper gives the final results of the ESTER evaluation cam- paign which started in 2003 and ended in January 2005. The aim of this campaign was to evaluate automatic broadcast news rich transcription systems for the French language. The evalua- tion tasks were divided into three main categories: orthographic transcription, event detection and tracking (e.g. speech vs. mu- sic, speaker tracking), and information extraction. The last one, limited to named entity detection in this evaluation, was a pre- liminary test. The paper reports on protocols and gives the re- sults obtained in the campaign.","authors":["Sebastian Galliano","Edouard Geoffrois","Djamel Mostefa","Khalid Choukri"],"meta":["September 2005","DOI:10.21437/Interspeech.2005-441","SourceDBLP","Conference: INTERSPEECH 2005 - Eurospeech, 9th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, Lisbon, Portugal, September 4-8, 2005"],"references":["2355264_Performance_Measures_For_Information_Extraction","247868579_The_ESTER_Evaluation_Campaign_for_the_Rich_Transcription_of_French_Broadcast_News","235744973_Organisation_de_la_premiere_campagne_AUPELF_pour_l'evaluation_des_systemes_de_dictee_vocale","224612826_Approaches_and_applications_of_audio_diarization"]}
