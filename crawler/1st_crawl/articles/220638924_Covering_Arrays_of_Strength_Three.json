{"id":"220638924_Covering_Arrays_of_Strength_Three","abstract":"A covering array of size N, degree k, order v and strength t is a k × N array with entries from a set of v symbols such that in any t × N subarray every t × 1 column occurs at least once. Covering arrays have been studied for their applications to drug screening and software testing. We present explicit constructions and give constructive upper bounds for the size of a covering array of strength three.","authors":["M. A. Chateauneuf","Charles J. Colbourn","D. L.
