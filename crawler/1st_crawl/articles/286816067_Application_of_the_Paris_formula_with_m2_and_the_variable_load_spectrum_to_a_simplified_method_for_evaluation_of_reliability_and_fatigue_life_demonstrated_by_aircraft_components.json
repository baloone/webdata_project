Due to the different nature inherent to analytic forms of solutions for the Paris equations with their exponential parameter m = 2, that special case is the subject of a separate analysis. This paper also uses the transformation of a real spectrum with variable values of fatigue cycles into a homogenous spectrum with weighted cycles. The method was developed that uses the transformed spectrum to evaluate fatigue life for a selected component of the aircraft structure when the component suffers from an initial crack. The method for modeling of the crack length expansion uses a differential equation that is then subjected to transformations to obtain a partial differential equation of the Fokker-Planck type, which has a particular solution, explicitly the length density function for the crack of the component in question. That length density function served subsequently to determine reliability and fatigue life of a structural component where the crack length expanded from the permissible value ldto the critical threshold lkr.","authors":["Henryk Tomaszek","Michał Jasztal","Mariusz Zieja"],"meta":["January 2013Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc - Maintenance and Reliability 15(4):297-304"],"references":["289310963_A_simplified_method_to_assess_fatigue_life_of_selected_structural_components_of_an_aircraft_for_a_variable_load_spectrum","288582793_A_probabilistic_analysis_on_variability_of_fatigue_crack_growth_using_the_markov_chain","245198408_Reliability_solution_for_the_stochastic_fatigue_crack_growth_problem","245197581_Micromechanics_theory_of_fatigue_crack_initiation_and_propagation","245185769_Early_Fatigue_Crack_Growth_as_the_Damage_Accumulation_Process","245096489_A_stochastic_model_for_estimating_the_fatigue_life_of_structural_steel_details","239370984_Cumulative_jump-correlated_model_for_random_fatigue","229558690_Load_interaction_effects_during_fatigue_crack_growth_under_variable_amplitude_loading-a_literature_review_Part_I_Empirical_trends","229449035_Load_interaction_effects_during_fatigue_crack_growth_under_variable_amplitude_loading-a_literature_review_Part_II_qualitative_interpretation","229277244_A_new_probabilistic_model_for_crack_propagation_under_fatigue_loads_and_its_connection_with_Wohler_fields","228577053_Stochastic_fatigue_damage_modeling_under_variable_amplitude_loading","227872128_Significance_of_fractography_for_investigations_of_fatigue_crack_growth_under_variable-amplitude_loading","222625019_Fatigue_crack_growth_in_the_aluminium_alloy_D16_under_constant_and_variable_amplitude_loading"]}
