{"id":"319636187_Disease_Staging_and_Prognosis_in_Smokers_Using_Deep_Learning_in_Chest_Computed_Tomography","abstract":"Rationale: \nDeep learning is a powerful tool that may allow for improved outcome prediction.\n\nObjectives: \nTo determine if deep learning, specifically convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis, could detect and stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predict acute respiratory disease events (ARD) and mortality in smokers.\n\nMethods: \nA CNN was trained using CT scans from 7,983 COPDGene participants and evaluated using 1000 non-overlapping COPDGene participants and 1,672 ECLIPSE participants. Logistic regression (c-statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test) was used to assess COPD diagnosis and ARD prediction. Cox regression (c-index and the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino test) was used to assess mortality.\n\nMeasurements and main results: \nIn COPDGene, the c-statistic for the detection of COPD was 0.856. 51.1% of participants in COPDGene were accurately staged and 74.95% were within one stage. In ECLIPSE, 29.4% were accurately staged and 74.6% were within one stage. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE the c-statistics for ARD events were 0.64 and 0.55 respectively and the Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.502 and 0.380 respectively, suggesting no evidence of poor calibration. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE, CNN predicted mortality with fair discrimination (c-indices 0.72 and 0.60 respectively), and without evidence of poor calibration (Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino p-values of 0.307 and 0.331 respectively).\n\nConclusions: \nA deep learning approach that uses only CT imaging data can identify those smokers who have COPD and predict who are most likely to have ARD events and those with the highest mortality. At a population level CNN analysis may be a powerful tool for risk assessment.","authors":["Germán González","Samuel Ash","Gonzalo Vegas Sánchez-Ferrero","Jorge Onieva"],"meta":["September
