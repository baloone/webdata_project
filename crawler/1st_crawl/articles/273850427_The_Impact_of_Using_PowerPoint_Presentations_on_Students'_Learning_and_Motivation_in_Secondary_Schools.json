It enhances learning by providing a better understanding of the topic as well as motivating students. This study was carried out in Lar to investigate the effectiveness use of technology on teaching English (TEFL) process and if the learners prefer this new way of teaching over traditional instruction methods. Fifty-six female students of a secondary school in Lar were the subjects of this study. The subjects were split into two groups, (Experimental and Control). Each group was taught separately, one by using technology in class(e.g; video-projector, power-point, …), the other through a traditional method such as textbooks. An independent sample t-test was carried out and showed that there was a significant difference between the means of the two groups. It represented that teaching based on the use of technology had a significant positive effect on learners’ scores. Analyses showed that the experimental group learners performed better than the control group.","authors":["Fateme Samiei"],"meta":["May 2014Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 98:1672-1677","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.03.592"],"references":["286042743_Teaching_English_as_a_Global_Language_in_Smart_Classrooms_with_PowerPoint_Presentation","277106137_Using_multimodal_presentation_software_and_peer_group_discussion_in_learning_English_as_a_second_language","255566575_Social_Studies_Teachers'_Perspectives_of_Technology_Integration","237741274_Student_perceptions_on_language_learning_in_a_technological_environment_Implications_for_the_new_millennium","228864078_Can_PowerPoint_Presentations_Effectively_Replace_Textbooks_and_Blackboards_for_Teaching_Grammar_Do_Students_Find_Them_an_Effective_Tool","30807703_The_Value_of_Technology_in_the_EFL_and_ESL_Classroom_Using_the_Smartpen_to_Enhance_the_Productivity_and_Effectiveness_of_ESL_Instruction","26872602_Effect_of_technology_on_motivation_in_EFL_classrooms"]}
