{"id":"330250828_Homotopy_comultiplications_on_the_k-fold_wedge_of_spheres","abstract":"Regarding the calculation of homotopy classes of comultiplications on a wedge of spheres, the more spheres that appear in the wedge, the more complicated proofs and computations become. In this paper, we concentrate on the calculations of the comultiplications and the associative and commutative comultiplications on the k-fold wedge of spheres ∨i=1kSⁿⁱ for sufficiently large values of k as a generalization of the papers [3,4]. In particular, we observe extraordinary regularities and patterns on the conditions of associative and commutative comultiplications on the k-fold wedge of spheres.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee","Sunyoung Lee"],"meta":["March 2019Topology and its Applications 254(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.topol.2019.01.001"],"references":["314981629_Comultiplication_structures_for_awedge_of_spheres","251815135_Comultiplications_on_free_groups_and_wedges_of_circles","284953931_Co-H-spaces","271898514_On_the_generalized_same_N-type_conjecture","268017564_Comultiplications_of_the_Wedge_of_Two_Moore_Spaces","254209856_On_the_number_of_co-multiplications_of_a_suspension","247040843_On_the_Homotopy_Groups_of_the_Union_of_Spheres","243066665_On_the_same_N-type_conjecture_for_the_suspension_of_the_infinite_complex_projective_space","242983669_On_the_same_N_-type_structure_for_the_suspension_of_the_Eilenberg-Mac_Lane_spaces","238852710_Properties_of_comultiplications_on_a_wedge_of_spheres","238852057_Homotopy_associativity_and_finite_cw_complexes","238849699_Equivalence_classes_of_homotopy-associative_comultiplications_of_finite_complexes","227335951_Rational_Co-H-Spaces","226468341_Cogroups_and_suspensions","225177580_Comultiplications_on_a_wedge_of_two_spheres","45914741_On_the_same_N-type_of_the_suspension_of_the_infinite_quaternionic_projective_space"]}
