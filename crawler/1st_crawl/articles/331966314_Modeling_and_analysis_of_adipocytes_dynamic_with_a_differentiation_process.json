{"id":"331966314_Modeling_and_analysis_of_adipocytes_dynamic_with_a_differentiation_process","abstract":"We propose in this article a model describing the dynamic of a system of adipocytes, structured by their sizes. This model takes into account the differentiation of a population of mesenchymal cells into preadipocytes and of preadipocytes into adipocytes; the differentiation rates depend on the mean adipocyte radius. The considered equations are therefore ordinary differential equations, coupled with an advection equation, the growth rate of which depends on food availability and on the total surface of adipocytes. Since this velocity is discontinuous, we need to introduce a convenient notion of solutions coming from Filippov theory. We are consequently able to determine the stationary solutions of the system, to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions and to describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions in some simple cases. Finally, the parameters of the model are ﬁtted thanks to some experimental data and numerical simulations are displayed; a spatial extension of the model is studied numerically.","authors":["Jerome Gilleron","Thierry Goudon","Frédéric Lagoutière","Hugo Martin"],"meta":["January 2019ESAIM Proceedings and Surveys 67","DOI:10.1051/proc/202067013"],"references":["332147556_Numerical_schemes_for_the_aggregation_equation_with_pointy_potentials","316737181_Tissue_growth_pressure_drives_early_blood_flow_in_the_chicken_yolk_sac","315096041_Simple_mechanical_cues_could_explain_adipose_tissue_morphology","311859330_A_mixture_model_for_the_dynamic_of_the_gut_mucus_layer","261032354_Adipocyte_Stiffness_Increases_with_Accumulation_of_Lipid_Droplets","320075192_Convergence_analysis_of_upwind_type_schemes_for_the_aggregation_equation_with_pointy_potential","303779646_Emerging_Roles_of_Adipose_Progenitor_Cells_in_Tissue_Development_Homeostasis_Expansion_and_Thermogenesis","265418532_Model_of_adipose_tissue_cellularity_dynamics_during_food_restriction","265332949_Differential_equations_with_discontinuous_right-hand_side_Differentsial'nye_uravneniya_s_razryvnoj_pravoj_chast'yu","256291552_Nuclear_Lamin-A_Scales_with_Tissue_Stiffness_and_Enhances_Matrix-Directed_Differentiation","224915133_A_fluid_dynamics_model_of_the_growth_of_phototrophic_biofilms","7474412_Tissue_Cells_Feel_and_Respond_to_the_Stiffness_of_Their_Substrate","240111534_Measure_solutions_to_the_linear_multi-dimensional_transport_equation_with_non-smooth_coefficients","236637579_Modelling_adipocytes_size_distribution","51824751_Mechanotransduction_in_adipocytes"]}
