The fractal structure was obtained by using electrochemical deposition technique. The measured return loss of the proposed antenna present multi- and wideband behaviors. Three resonant bands around frequencies 1.4, 2.6, and 3.7 GHz with impedance bandwidth 16.6, 23.3, and 17.6% are observed, respectively. The measured gain is between 2 and 3 dBi at the cited resonant frequencies. The designed antenna permits various wireless operations in both L- and S-bands such as radar detection and 2.4 GHz WLAN. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
