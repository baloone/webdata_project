{"id":"326619334_Dynamic_Analysis_and_Control_of_Industrial_Robotic_Manipulators","abstract":"Robot simulation has developed quickly in recent decades. Along with the development of computer science, a lot of simulation soft-wares have been created to perform many purposes such as studying kinematic, dynamic, and off-line program to avoid obstacle on manipulator robots. The main objective of this study is therefore to analyze kinematic, dynamic characteristics of an R-R robotic manipulator in order to control this robot. Newton-Euler method was used to calculate the torque acting on each joint of the robot. Then, a numerical model of the robot was established by a multi-body dynamics software to compare with the results obtained by Newton-Euler theory. After that, a feed-forward control system was created by RecurDyn/CoLink to control the end-effector of the robot following a desired trajectory. The results showed that this research can be used for efficient simulation of structural kinematics, dynamics as well as control of the real manipulator robot with the robot structure in a virtual environment.","authors":["Yunn-Lin Hwang","Jung Kuang Cheng","Van-Thuan Truong"],"meta":["July 2018Applied Mechanics and Materials 883:30-36","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.883.30","Project: Dynamics"],"references":["298208505_Recursive_Newton-Euler_formulation_for_flexible_dynamic_manufacturing_analysis_of_open-loop_robotic_systems","279743788_Computer-Aided_Dynamic_Analysis_and_Simulation_of_Multibody_Manufacturing_Systems","274622188_Kinematic_Modelling_and_Simulation_of_a_2-R_Robot_Using_SolidWorks_and_Verification_by_MATLABSimulink","271643627_Model-Based_Control_of_A_Robot_Manipulator","256156293_Kinematic_and_Dynamic_Simulation_of_Multibody_Systems-The_Real-Time_Challenge","246274871_Fundamentals_of_Robotic_Mechanical_Systems_Theory"]}
