{"id":"282049958_A_scattered_point_set_hole-filling_method_based_on_boundary_extension_and_convergence","abstract":"A hole filling method for scattered point set based on boundary extension and boundary convergence is presented. The algorithm fills the holes by moving the boundary points along the extension direction into the missed regions. Firstly, the boundary points are extracted from the point cloud, and the extension direction of the boundary points are calculated by their neighborhood points, and then a repulsion operator is used to move the boundary points along the extension direction into the missed regions. In the process of repulsion operator, we introduce a smooth operation for smoothing the boundary points to enhance the correlation between adjacent points in the boundary points, which makes the boundary points converge together after the iterative repulsion operation, and then achieve hole-filling. Besides, we introduce the Boundary Convergence method to fill holes on the surface of the scanning model, which has proved to be effect. The experiment results show that the proposed hole-filling algorithm can get better results.","authors":["Xiaojun Wu","Wenlue Chen"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1109/WCICA.2014.7053624"],"references":["260584468_Iterative_Consolidation_of_Unorganized_Point_Clouds","220184139_Parameterization-free_projection_for_geometry_reconstruction","3766232_Consensus_Surfaces_for_Modeling_3D_Objects_from_Multiple_Range_Images","3410878_The_Ball-Pivoting_Algorithm_for_Surface_Reconstruction","2951980_A_New_Voronoi-Based_Surface_Reconstruction_Algorithm","2371369_Automatic_Reconstruction_of_Surfaces_and_Scalar_Fields_from_3D_Scans","318780128_Consolidation_of_Unorganized_Point_Clouds_for_Surface_Reconstruction","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","248495440_Zippered_polygon_meshes_from_range_data","229699790_Interpolatory_Refinement_for_Real-Time_Processing_ofPoint-Based_Geometry","228811812_3-subdivision","222399270_From_laser-scanned_data_to_feature_human_model_A_system_based_on_fuzzy_logic_concept","221316529_Screened_Poisson_Surface_Reconstruction","220721237_Zipped_polygon_meshes_from_range_images","220506839_Interpolatory_Refinement_for_Real-Time_Processing_of_Point-Based_Geometry","220184367_Consolidation_of_unorganized_point_clouds_for_surface_reconstruction","3962036_Filling_Holes_In_Complex_Surfaces_Using_Volumetric_Diffusion","2916943_A_Volumetric_Method_for_Building_Complex_Models_from_Range_Images"]}
