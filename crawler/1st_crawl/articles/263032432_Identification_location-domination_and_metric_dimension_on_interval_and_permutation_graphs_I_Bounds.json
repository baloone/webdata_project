{"id":"263032432_Identification_location-domination_and_metric_dimension_on_interval_and_permutation_graphs_I_Bounds","abstract":"We consider the problems of finding optimal identifying codes, (open) locating-dominating sets and resolving sets of an interval or a permutation graph. In these problems, one asks to distinguish all vertices of a graph using a subset of the vertices and either the neighborhood within the solution set or the distances to the solution vertices. Using a general reduction for this class of problems, we prove that the decision problems associated to these four notions are NP-complete, even for graphs that are at the same time interval graphs and permutation graphs and have diameter~2. On the other hand, we describe linear-time algorithms for cographs. We also give new upper bounds for the order of a (unit) interval graph, a (bipartite) permutation graph or a cograph of given solution size to all these problems.","authors":["Florent Foucaud","George B.
