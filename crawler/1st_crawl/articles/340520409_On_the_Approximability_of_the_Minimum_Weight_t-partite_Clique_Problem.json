{"id":"340520409_On_the_Approximability_of_the_Minimum_Weight_t-partite_Clique_Problem","abstract":"The Minimum Weight t-partite Clique Problem MWtCP is the\nproblem of finding a t-clique with minimum weight in a complete edge-\nweighted t-partite graph. The motivation for studying this problem is its\npotential in modelling the problem of identifying sets of commonly ex-\nisting putative co-regulated, co-expressed genes, called gene clusters. In\nthis paper, we show that MWtCP is NP-hard, APX-hard in the general\ncase. We also present a 2-approximation algorithm that runs in O(n^2) for\nthe metric case and has 1+(1/t)-approximation performance guarantee for the ultrametric subclass of instances. We further show how relaxing or tightening the application of the metricity property affects the approximation ratio. Finally insights on the application MWtCP to gene cluster discovery are presented.","authors":["Geoffrey Aserios Solano","Guillaume Blin","Mathieu Raffinot","Jhoirene B.
