{"id":"340104554_A_12-Lead_ECG_Database_to_Identify_Origins_of_Idiopathic_Ventricular_Arrhythmia_Containing_334_Patients","abstract":"Cardiac catheter ablation has shown the effectiveness of treating the idiopathic premature ventricular complex and ventricular tachycardia. As the most important prerequisite for successful therapy, criteria based on analysis of 12-lead ECGs are employed to reliably speculate the locations of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia before a subsequent catheter ablation procedure. Among these possible locations, right ventricular outflow tract and left outflow tract are the major ones. We created a new 12-lead ECG database under the auspices of Chapman University and Ningbo First Hospital of Zhejiang University that aims to provide high quality data enabling detection of the distinctions between idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia from right ventricular outflow tract to left ventricular outflow tract. The dataset contains 334 subjects who successfully underwent a catheter ablation procedure that validated the accurate origins of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia.","authors":["Jianwei Zheng","Guohua Fu","Kyle Anderson","Huimin Chu"],"meta":["March 2020Scientific Data 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41597-020-0440-8"],"references":["335585856_The_V1-V3_transition_index_as_a_novel_electrocardiographic_criterion_for_differentiating_left_from_right_ventricular_outflow_tract_ventricular_arrhythmias","333021981_2019_HRSEHRAAPHRSLAHRS_expert_consensus_statement_on_catheter_ablation_of_ventricular_arrhythmias_Executive_summary","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","330035848_V3RV7_Index","327750493_Lead_I_R-wave_Amplitude_to_Differentiate_Idiopathic_Ventricular_Arrhythmias_with_Left_Bundle_Branch_Block_Right_Inferior_Axis_Originating_from_the_Left_versus_Right_Ventricular_Outflow_Tract_XIE_et_al","322834488_Heart_Disease_and_Stroke_Statistics-2018_Update_A_Report_From_the_American_Heart_Association","291005445_Recommendations_for_the_standardization_and_interpretation_of_the_electrocardiogram_Part_I_The_electrocardiogram_and_its_technology","274460615_Differentiating_the_origin_of_outflow_tract_ventricular_arrhythmia_using_a_simple_novel_approach","260681320_A_Novel_Electrocardiographic_Criterion_for_Differentiating_a_Left_from_Right_Ventricular_Outflow_Tract_Tachycardia_Origin_The_V2SV3R_Index","227861506_Development_and_Validation_of_an_ECG_Algorithm_for_Identifying_the_Optimal_Ablation_Site_for_Idiopathic_Ventricular_Outflow_Tract_Tachycardia"]}
