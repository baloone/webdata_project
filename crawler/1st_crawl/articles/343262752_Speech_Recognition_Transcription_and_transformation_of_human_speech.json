{"id":"343262752_Speech_Recognition_Transcription_and_transformation_of_human_speech","abstract":"The specified subfield of computational linguistics and computer science can said to be linked with speech recognition. Speech recognition can develop new variation technologies as well as methodologies generated as interdisciplinary concept. It can be considered to translate and recognize and satisfy the capability towards understanding and translating the words that are already spoken. It is more preciously said that in the most recent times this field has secured positive feedback by intense learning of voice recognition. Such evidences shows the proof that it has more market demand for implementing the application of specific data as voice recognition. Deployment of speech recognition systems can be utilized as the evidence shown to its analyzing methods that is helpful for designing each and every individual's future. It is said that the computer plays an important role for this process as by this all the translated words can be acknowledged by the texts also.","authors":["Vishal Dineshkumar Soni"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal on Integrated Education 2(6):257-262"],"references":["323227534_Continuous_Punjabi_speech_recognition_model_based_on_Kaldi_ASR_toolkit","315046299_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_Predicts_Speech_Intelligibility_and_Comprehension_for_Listeners_With_Simulated_Age-Related_Hearing_Loss","348915614_Adversarial_Attacks_Against_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_Systems_via_Psychoacoustic_Hiding","329564028_Ontology_for_Transcription_of_ATC_Speech_Commands_of_SESAR_2020_Solution_PJ16-04","327389166_Unsupervised_Adaptation_with_Interpretable_Disentangled_Representations_for_Distant_Conversational_Speech_Recognition","327388902_The_Fifth_'CHiME'_Speech_Separation_and_Recognition_Challenge_Dataset_Task_and_Baselines","322710766_Unsupervised_domain_adaptation_for_robust_speech_recognition_via_variational_autoencoder-based_data_augmentation","322707033_Listening_while_speaking_Speech_chain_by_deep_learning","317692941_The_phoneme_set_influence_for_lithuanian_speech_commands_recognition_accuracy"]}
