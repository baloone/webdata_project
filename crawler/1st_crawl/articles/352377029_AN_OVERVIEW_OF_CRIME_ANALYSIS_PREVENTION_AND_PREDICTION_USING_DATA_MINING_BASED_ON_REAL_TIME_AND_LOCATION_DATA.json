{"id":"352377029_AN_OVERVIEW_OF_CRIME_ANALYSIS_PREVENTION_AND_PREDICTION_USING_DATA_MINING_BASED_ON_REAL_TIME_AND_LOCATION_DATA","abstract":"Crime analysis and prevention is a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in crime. The system can predict regions which have high probability for crime occurrence and can visualize crime prone areas. With the increasing advent of computerized systems, crime data analysts can help the Law enforcement officers to speed up the process of solving crimes. Using the concept of data mining, real time and location data, the system can extract unknown, useful information from an unstructured data. Here we have an approach between computer science and criminal justice to develop a data mining, real time and location data procedure that can help solve crimes faster. Instead of focusing on causes of crime occurrence like criminal background of offender, political enmity etc. we are focusing mainly on crime factors of each day. To have a better response towards criminal activity, it is very important that one should understand the patterns in crime. I analyses these patterns by taking crime datasets from the Nigeria Police zone six (6) Calabar, Cross River State and town planning bodies. This dataset includes different streets of the city of Calabar. The major aim of this mission is to expect which category of crime is most probably to take place at a detailed time and places in Calabar.","authors":["Okeke Ogochukwu C","Oranyelu Forster O."],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.33564/IJEAST.2021.v05i10.015"],"references":["316446574_Prediction_of_crime_occurrence_from_multi-modal_data_using_deep_learning","302986671_Survey_of_Crime_Analysis_and_Prediction","280722606_Crime_Analysis_and_Prediction_Using_Data_Mining","333117394_Naive_Bayes_Approach_for_the_Crime_Prediction_in_Data_Mining","323277973_Survey_paper_on_crime_prediction_using_ensemble_approach","313454337_Area-Specific_Crime_Prediction_Models"]}
