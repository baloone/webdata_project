{"id":"264006074_Creating_Social_Intelligence_for_Product_Portfolio_Design","abstract":"Increasing numbers of people are using social media to express their personal experiences. Recently, these plentiful user-generated data sources have been utilized promisingly by enterprises for product creation. In this research, we propose a social intelligence mechanism that can extract and consolidate the reviews expressed via social media and derive insights (product feature specification and feature importance) to help enterprises to make decisions on developing next-generation products by analyzing the reviewersâ€™ knowledge and authority and their opinion sentiment toward the target products. The experimental results obtained using Epinion.com show that the proposed mechanism outperforms other benchmark approaches in market trend prediction and customer acceptance.","authors":["Yung-Ming Li","Hsuan-Ming Chen","Jyh Hwa Liou","Lien-Fa Lin"],"meta":["July 2014Decision Support Systems 66","DOI:10.1016/j.dss.2014.06.013"],"references":["227447713_Deriving_the_Pricing_Power_of_Product_Features_by_Mining_Consumer_Reviews","221444736_Red_Opal_Product-feature_scoring_from_reviews","220434402_Twitter_Power_Tweets_as_Electronic_Word_of_Mouth","215470695_Entity_Discovery_and_Assignment_for_Opinion_Mining_Applications","200772541_Power_of_the_Few_vs_Wisdom_of_the_Crowd_Wikipedia_and_the_Rise_of_the_Bourgeoisie","200044296_Mining_Opinion_Features_in_Customer_Reviews","200044289_SentiWordNet_A_Publicly_Available_Lexical_Resource_for_Opinion_Mining","5198170_Deriving_the_Pricing_Power_of_Product_Features_by_Mining_Consumer_Reviews","4047551_Sentiment_Analyzer_Extracting_sentiments_about_a_given_topic_using_natural_language_processing_techniques","2474110_A_Model_of_Textual_Affect_Sensing_Using_Real-World_Knowledge","2378662_Topic_Detection_and_Tracking_Pilot_Study_Final_Report","273045398_Foundations_of_Behavioral_Research","259119044_What's_buzzing_in_the_blizzard_of_buzz_Automotive_component_isolation_in_social_media_postings","257016136_RETRACTED_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Decision_Sciences_Research_An_Illustration_to_IT_Governance","257015945_To_whom_should_I_listen_Finding_reputable_reviewers_in_opinion-sharing_communities","257015931_Making_objective_decisions_from_subjective_data_Detecting_irony_in_customer_reviews","257015862_Deriving_market_intelligence_from_microblogs","241088885_Providing_product_use_knowledge_for_the_design_of_improved_product_generations","235250838_Social_enterprise_through_the_eyes_of_the_consumer_prepared_for_the_National_Consumer_Council","224364168_Study_for_industrial_design_based_on_knowledge_management","222822772_Product-form_design_model_based_on_Genetic_Algorithms","222821584_Identification_of_influencers_-_Measuring_influence_in_customer_networks","222417569_Estimating_aggregate_consumer_preferences_from_online_product_reviews","222413365_Using_text_mining_and_sentiment_analysis_for_online_forums_hotspot_detection_and_forecast","221012739_Low-Quality_Product_Review_Detection_in_Opinion_Summarization","220591681_Design_and_Use_of_Preference_Markets_for_Evaluation_of_Early_Stage_Technologies","220219577_Developing_the_index_for_product_design_communication_and_evaluation_from_emotional_perspectives","220197153_Multi-criteria_group_consensus_under_linear_cost_opinion_elasticity","220040835_Co-Creation_Toward_a_Taxonomy_and_an_Integrated_Research_Perspective","200044309_WordNet_A_Lexical_Database_for_English","44831074_Principal_component_analysis_2nd_ed","31737393_Interaction_design_beyond_human-computer_interaction","6502536_The_marketing_implications_of_affective_product_design","3114081_Consensus_Diagnosis_A_Simulation_Study"]}
