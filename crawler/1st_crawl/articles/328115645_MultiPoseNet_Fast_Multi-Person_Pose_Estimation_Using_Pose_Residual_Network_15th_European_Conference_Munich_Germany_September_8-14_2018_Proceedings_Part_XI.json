MultiPoseNet can jointly handle person detection, person segmentation and pose estimation problems. The novel assignment method is implemented by the Pose Residual Network (PRN) which receives keypoint and person detections, and produces accurate poses by assigning keypoints to person instances. On the COCO keypoints dataset, our pose estimation method outperforms all previous bottom-up methods both in accuracy (+4-point mAP over previous best result) and speed; it also performs on par with the best top-down methods while being at least 4x faster. Our method is the fastest real time system with \\(\\sim 23\\) frames/sec.","authors":["Muhammed Kocabas","Salih Karagoz","Emre Akbas"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01252-6_26","In book: Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2018 (pp.437-453)"],"references":["332814678_Bayesian_SegNet_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architectures_for_Scene_Understanding","329747444_Cascaded_Pyramid_Network_for_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation","345150970_Recurrent_Human_Pose_Estimation","331858737_Self_Adversarial_Training_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","325000451_A_Greedy_Part_Assignment_Algorithm_for_Real-Time_Multi-person_2D_Pose_Estimation","323027025_Encoder-Decoder_with_Atrous_Separable_Convolution_for_Semantic_Image_Segmentation","322060396_Mask_R-CNN","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","322059220_RMPE_Regional_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation","322058669_A_Coarse-Fine_Network_for_Keypoint_Localization"]}
