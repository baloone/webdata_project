{"id":"307627966_A_survey_on_algorithms_of_hole_filling_in_3D_surface_reconstruction","abstract":"The surface reconstruction of 3D objects has attracted more and more attention for its widespread application in many areas, such as computer science, cultural heritage restoration, medical facilities, entertainment. However, due to occlusion, reflectance, the scanning angle, raw data preprocessing, it is inevitable to lose some point data, which leads to holes in the reconstruction surface, making it undesirable for various applications. Therefore, methods for filling holes in the process of surface reconstruction are critical to the final results of reconstruction. This paper makes a survey of existing well-known hole-filling algorithms, classifies the algorithms into two main categories, analyzes and compares these algorithms from the viewpoints of theories and experimental results to make a clear introduction of their performance. At the end, the paper points out the possible development direction of hole filling in the future and hopes to be a good guide for other researchers.","authors":["Xiaoyuan Guo","Jun Xiao","Ying Wang"],"meta":["January 2018The Visual Computer 34(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00371-016-1316-y"],"references":["285385649_Extraction_of_Reliable_Primitives_from_Unorganized_Point_Clouds","276440851_Filling_holes_in_digitized_point_cloud_using_a_morphing-based_approach_to_preserve_volume_characteristics","275104101_Poisson-driven_seamless_completion_of_triangular_meshes","317512321_METHOD_OF_HOLE-FILLING_ON_TRIANGULAR_MESHES_USING_LOCAL_RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION","300209770_Free_Open_Source_Mesh_Healing_for_TCAD_Device_Simulations","282049958_A_scattered_point_set_hole-filling_method_based_on_boundary_extension_and_convergence","268689488_Reverse_Engineering_Point_Clouds_to_Fit_Tensor_Product_B-Spline_Surfaces_by_Blending_Local_Fits","267464150_Implicit_Shape_Reconstruction_of_Unorganized_Points_Using_PDE-Based_Deformable_3D_Manifolds","265260952_Completing_a_model_based_on_laser_scan_generated_point_cloud_data","262403734_Context-Based_Coherent_Surface_Completion","262175346_Polygon_Mesh_Repairing_An_Application_Perspective","261421143_Filling_large_holes_in_LiDAR_data_by_inpainting_depth_gradients","261232212_Depth_hole_filling_using_the_depth_distribution_of_neighboring_regions_of_depth_holes_in_the_Kinect_sensor","257070307_Reverse_Engineering_Point_Clouds_to_Obtain_Tensor_Product_B-Spline_Surfaces","251962218_Hole_filling_based_on_local_surface_approximation"]}
