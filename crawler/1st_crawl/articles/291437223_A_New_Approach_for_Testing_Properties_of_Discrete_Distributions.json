{"id":"291437223_A_New_Approach_for_Testing_Properties_of_Discrete_Distributions","abstract":"We study problems in distribution property testing: Given sample access to\none or more unknown discrete distributions, we want to determine whether they\nhave some global property or are $\\epsilon$-far from having the property in\n$\\ell_1$ distance. In this paper, we provide a simple and general approach to\nobtain upper bounds in this setting, by reducing $\\ell_1$-testing to\n$\\ell_2$-testing. Our reduction yields optimal $\\ell_1$-testers, by using a\nstandard $\\ell_2$-tester as a black-box.\nUsing our framework, we obtain sample-optimal and computationally efficient\nestimators for a wide variety of $\\ell_1$ distribution testing problems,\nincluding the following: identity testing to a fixed distribution, closeness\ntesting between two unknown distributions (with equal/unequal sample sizes),\nindependence testing (in any number of dimensions), closeness testing for\ncollections of distributions, and testing $k$-histograms. For most of these\nproblems, we give the first optimal testers in the literature. Moreover, our\nestimators are significantly simpler to state and analyze compared to previous\napproaches.\nAs our second main contribution, we provide a direct general approach for\nproving distribution testing lower bounds, by bounding the mutual information.\nOur lower bound approach is not restricted to symmetric properties, and we use\nit to prove tight lower bounds for the aforementioned problems.","authors":["Ilias Diakonikolas","Daniel Kane"],"meta":["January 2016","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280330247_Optimal_Testing_for_Properties_of_Distributions","275274916_Testing_Closeness_With_Unequal_Sized_Samples","265848025_An_Automatic_Inequality_Prover_and_Instance_Optimal_Identity_Testing","255971869_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Testing_Closeness_of_Discrete_Distributions","344477911_Testing_Statistical_Hypotheses","314795262_The_complexity_of_approximating_entropy","308814715_Optimal_Algorithms_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Testing_Closeness_of_Structured_Distributions","269269397_Sublinear_algorithms_for_outlier_detection_and_generalized_closeness_testing","266591412_Competitive_Classification_and_Closeness_Testing","254006518_Approximating_and_Testing_k-Histogram_Distributions_in_Sub-linear_Time"]}
