We prove that in some cases this relaxation provides us with a constant relative accuracy estimate for the exact solution.","authors":["Yurii NESTEROV"],"meta":["January 1998Optimization Methods and Software 9(1)","DOI:10.1080/10556789808805690"],"references":["242371169_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","246503665_Interior_point_polynomial_time_method_for_truss_topology_design","245766163_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","230725447_Interior-point_polynomial_algorithms_in_convex_programming","2946487_Approximating_quadratic_programming_with_bound_constraints_Yinyu_Ye"]}
