{"id":"305220222_STREAM_The_Stanford_Data_Stream_Management_System","abstract":"Traditional database management systems are best equipped to run one-time queries over finite stored data sets. However, many modern applications such as network monitoring, financial analysis, manufacturing, and sensor networks require long-running, or continuous, queries over continuous unbounded streams of data. In the STREAM project at Stanford, we are investigating data management and query processing for this class of applications. As part of the project we are building a general-purpose prototype Data Stream Management System (DSMS), also called STREAM, that supports a large class of declarative continuous queries over continuous streams and traditional stored data sets. The STREAM prototype targets environments where streams may be rapid, stream characteristics and query loads may vary over time, and system resources may be limited.","authors":["Arvind Arasu","Brian Babcock","Shivnath Babu","John Cieslewicz"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-28608-0_16","In book: Data Stream Management (pp.317-336)"],"references":["243766281_Load_Shedding_on_Data_Streams","221559970_Models_and_Issues_in_Data_Stream_Systems","221213261_Chain_Operator_Scheduling_for_Memory_Minimization_in_Data_Stream_Systems","220779401_Caching_queues_in_memory_buffers","220225149_Characterizing_memory_requirements_for_queries_over_continuous_data_streams","3297049_Exploiting_punctuation_semantics_in_continuous_data_streams","2901127_The_CQL_Continuous_Query_Language_Semantic_Foundations_and_Query_Execution","2558505_Matching_Events_in_a_Content-based_Subscription_System","247341437_READY_A_high_performance_event_notification_system","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221559914_Flexible_Time_Management_in_Data_Stream_Systems","221311547_Maximizing_the_Output_Rate_of_Multi-Way_Join_Queries_over_Streaming_Information_Sources","221213980_Filtering_Algorithms_and_Implementation_for_Very_Fast_PublishSubscribe","221213490_Adaptive_Ordering_of_Pipelined_Stream_Filters","221213076_StreaMon_An_Adaptive_Engine_for_Stream_Query_Processing","221212916_Dynamic_multidimensional_histograms","220424808_SpaceTime_Trade-Offs_in_Hash_Coding_With_Allowable_Errors","4133433_Adaptive_Caching_for_Continuous_Queries","4084770_Load_Shedding_for_Aggregation_Queries_over_Data_Streams","2926081_Exploiting_k-Constraints_to_Reduce_Memory_Overhead_in_Continuous_Queries_over_Data_Streams","2438276_Approximate_Query_Processing_Using_Wavelets"]}
