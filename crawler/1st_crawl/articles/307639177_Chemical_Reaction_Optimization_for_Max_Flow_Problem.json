{"id":"307639177_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_for_Max_Flow_Problem","abstract":"This study presents an algorithm for MaxFlow\nproblem using \"Chemical Reaction Optimization algorithm\n(CRO)\". CRO is a recently established meta-heuristics algorithm\nfor optimization, inspired by the nature of chemical reactions.\nThe main concern is to find the best maximum flow value at\nwhich the flow can be shipped from the source node to the sink\nnode in a flow network without violating any capacity constraints\nin which the flow of each edge remains within the upper bound\nvalue of the capacity. The proposed MaxFlow-CRO algorithm is\npresented, analyzed asymptotically and experimental test is\nconducted. Asymptotic runtime is derived theoretically. The\nalgorithm is implemented using JAVA programming language.\nResults show a good performance with a complexity of O(I E2),\nfor I iterations and E edges. The number of iterations I in the\nalgorithm, is an important factor that will affect the results\nobtained. As number of iterations is increased, best possible maxFlow\nvalue is obtained.","authors":["Reham Barham","Ahmad Abdel-Aziz Sharieh","Azzam Sleit"],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(8):189-196","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070826"],"references":["264380035_Constrained_Maximum_Flow_in_Stochastic_Networks","262277073_Max_flows_in_Onm_time_or_better","257779624_Chemical_Reaction_Optimization_A_tutorial","228057808_A_Faster_Deterministic_Maximum_Flow_Algorithm","292025923_Algorithm_for_solution_of_a_problem_of_maximum_flow_in_a_network_with_power_estimation","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242392457_A_New_Max-Flow_Algorithm","228057720_Flows_In_Networks","228057718_Maximal_Flow_Through_a_Network","224090271_Chemical-Reaction-Inspired_Metaheuristic_for_Optimization"]}
