{"id":"300078491_Interpolants_in_Nonlinear_Theories_Over_the_Reals","abstract":"We develop algorithms for computing Craig interpolants for first-order formulas over real numbers with a wide range of nonlinear functions, including transcendental functions and differential equations. We transform proof traces from \\(\\delta \\)-complete decision procedures into interpolants that consist of Boolean combinations of linear constraints. The algorithms are guaranteed to find the interpolants between two formulas A and B whenever \\(A \\wedge B\\) is not \\(\\delta \\)-satisfiable. At the same time, by exploiting \\(\\delta \\)-perturbations one can parameterize the algorithm to find interpolants with different positions between A and B. We show applications of the methods in control and robotic design, and hybrid system verification.","authors":["Sicun Gao","Damien Zufferey"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_41","Conference: International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems"],"references":["271140454_Spatial_Interpolants","267800834_SMTInterpol_an_Interpolating_SMT_Solver","264387646_Online_Verification_of_Automated_Road_Vehicles_Using_Reachability_Analysis","263736754_Parameter_Synthesis_for_Cardiac_Cell_Hybrid_Models_Using_Delta-Decisions","262365576_The_MathSAT5_SMT_solver","262333922_Automated_Verification_of_Recursive_Programs_with_Pointers","262213254_Ufo_A_Framework_for_Abstraction-_and_Interpolation-Based_Software_Verification","235656617_Generating_Non-Linear_Interpolants_by_Semidefinite_Programming","225145312_Generalizing_DPLL_to_Richer_Logics","225104380_An_Interpolating_Sequent_Calculus_for_Quantifier-Free_Presburger_Arithmetic","224040040_Delta-Complete_Decision_Procedures_for_Satisfiability_over_the_Reals","221551015_Whale_An_Interpolation-Based_Algorithm_for_Inter-procedural_Verification","221550980_Interpolant_Strength","321524558_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","313771315_Partial_cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition_for_quantifier_elimination","301972004_dReach_d-Reachability_Analysis_for_Hybrid_Systems","299850095_Constraint_solving_for_interpolation","297313532_An_interpolating_theorem_prover","288823390_Flow-Sensitive_Fault_Localization","273398201_Designing_and_verifying_distributed_cyber-physical_systems_using_Multirate_PALS_An_airplane_turning_control_system_case_study","266024290_Proof_Generation_from_Delta-Decisions","266012406_Error_Invariants","262349672_Explaining_inconsistent_code","262274229_dReal_An_SMT_Solver_for_Nonlinear_Theories_over_the_Reals","262167988_Flow_An_Analyzer_for_Non-linear_Hybrid_Systems","261959651_Simulation-guided_lyapunov_analysis_for_hybrid_dynamical_systems","260737049_Interpolants_from_Z3_proofs","258144854_Satisfiability_modulo_ODEs","251470831_Chapter_16_Continuous_and_Interval_Constraints","226659904_A_Tutorial_on_Computable_Analysis","225637959_Interpolation_and_SAT-Based_Model_Checking","225129002_A_Combination_Method_for_Generating_Interpolants","224872172_Delta-Decidability_over_the_Reals","223652348_Partial_Cylindrical_Algebraic_Decomposition_for_Quantifier_Elimination","221551154_Interpolants_and_Symbolic_Model_Checking","221477417_Widening_and_Interpolation","221403002_Lazy_Abstraction_with_Interpolants","38383876_Lower_Bounds_for_Resolution_and_Cutting_Plane_Proofs_and_Monotone_Computations","38376746_Linear_reasoning_A_new_form_of_the_Herbrand-Gentzen_theorem"]}
