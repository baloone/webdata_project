{"id":"306037301_Springer_Series_on_Cultural_Computing","abstract":"This exciting new book explores the relationship between cultural traditions and computers, looking at how people from very different cultures and backgrounds communicate and how the use of information technologies can support and enhance these dialogues.\nHistorically we developed our understanding of other cultures through traditional means (museums, printed literature, etc.) but the advent of information technologies has allowed us access to a plethora of material. Tosa asks the question “Can we understand other cultures using computers as media to supplement thinking and memorization?” Starting with a survey of art and technology, moving into the area of culture and technology, the book culminates with a vision of a new world based on an understanding of these relationships, allowing cultural creators and viewers the opportunity to reach a better and more profound understanding of the role information technology will play going forward.","authors":["Naoko Tosa"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4471-6512-5","ISBN: 978-1-4471-6511-8"],"references":[]}
