{"id":"289000475_An_Analogy_between_Bin_Packing_Problem_and_Permutation_Problem_A_New_Encoding_Scheme","abstract":"The bin packing problem aims to pack a set of items in a minimum number of bins, with respect to the size of the items and capacity of the bins. This is an NP-hard problem. Several approach methods have been developed to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a new encoding scheme which is used in a hybrid resolution: a metaheuristic is matched with a list algorithm (Next Fit, First Fit, Best Fit) to solve the bin packing problem. Any metaheuristic can be used but in this paper, our proposition is implemented on a single solution based metaheuristic (stochastic descent, simulated annealing, kangaroo algorithm). This hybrid method is tested on literature instances to ensure its good results.
