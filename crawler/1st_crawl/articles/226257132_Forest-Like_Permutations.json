{"id":"226257132_Forest-Like_Permutations","abstract":"Given a permutation p Î Sn\\pi \\in {{\\mathcal{S}}}_{n}, construct a graph G\nπ on the vertex set {1, 2,..., n} by joining i to j if (i) i <j and π(i) <π(j) and (ii) there is no k such that i <k <j and π(i) < π(k) <π(j). We say that π is forest-like if G\nπ is a forest. We first characterize forest-like permutations in terms of pattern avoidance, and then by a certain linear map\nbeing onto. Thanks to recent results of Woo and Yong, these show that forest-like permutations characterize Schubert varieties\nwhich are locally factorial. Thus forest-like permutations generalize smooth permutations (corresponding to smooth Schubert\nvarieties).\n\nWe compute the generating function of forest-like permutations. As in the smooth case, it turns out to be algebraic. We then\nadapt our method to count permutations for which G\nπ is a tree, or a path, and recover the known generating function of smooth permutations.","authors":["Mireille Bousquet-Mélou","Steve Butler"],"meta":["December 2007Annals of Combinatorics 11(3):335-354","DOI:10.1007/s00026-007-0322-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["2119495_On_Degrees_in_the_Hasse_Diagram_of_the_Strong_Bruhat_Order","2099034_Generic_Singularities_Of_Schubert_Varieties","286546825_Counting_1324-avoiding_permutations","266706614_Combinatorics_of_Coxeter_Groups","266509514_Turan's_Graph_Theorem","246544506_Metabolic_cofactors_play_an_important_role_in_fibrosis_progression_in_initially_mild_chronic_hepatitis_C","229218405_Singularites_generiques_et_quasi-resolutions_des_varietes_de_Schubert_pour_le_groupe_lineaire","225921714_Criterion_for_smoothness_of_Schubert_varieties_in_SlnB","225699070_Some_order-theoretic_properties_of_the_Robinson-Schensted_correspondence","223343803_Linear_recurrences_with_constant_coefficients_The_multivariate_case","222814838_Wilf-equivalence_for_singleton_classes","222775975_A_combinatorial_proof_of_J_West's_conjecture","222652364_When_is_a_Schubert_variety_Gorenstein","222559799_On_the_Stanley-Wilf_limit_of_4231-avoiding_permutations_and_a_conjecture_of_Arratia","222519403_Governing_Singularities_of_Schubert_Varieties","220192290_Lattice_animals_and_heaps_of_dimers","220189950_Permutations_avoiding_certain_patterns_The_case_of_length_4_and_some_generalizations","220077730_1_Introduction_Symmetric_Functions_and_P-Recursiveness","2312990_The_Permutation_Classes_Equinumerous_to_the_Smooth_Class","2116029_Generating_Functions_for_Generating_Trees"]}
