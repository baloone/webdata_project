{"id":"301836273_Quantum_algorithms_for_Gibbs_sampling_and_hitting-time_estimation","abstract":"We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in $\\sqrt{N \\beta/{\\cal Z}}$ and polynomial in $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, ${\\cal Z}$ is the partition function, and $\\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ and quadratically improves the dependence on $\\beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For a sparse stochastic matrix $P$, it runs in time almost linear in $1/(\\epsilon \\Delta^{3/2})$, where $\\epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation and $\\Delta$ is a parameter determined by $P$, and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ and $1/\\Delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations.","authors":["Anirban Chowdhury","Rolando D.
