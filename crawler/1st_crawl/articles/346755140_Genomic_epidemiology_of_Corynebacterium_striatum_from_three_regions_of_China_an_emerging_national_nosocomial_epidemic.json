{"id":"346755140_Genomic_epidemiology_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_from_three_regions_of_China_an_emerging_national_nosocomial_epidemic","abstract":"Background\nCorynebacteritum straitum has been considered as an emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen. Isolation of MDR C. striatum as the only organism from respiratory samples from hospitalized patients is increasing in China.\n\nAim\nTo elucidate the genomic epidemiology and evolution of C. striatum in China.\n\nMethods\n260 isolates from 2016 to 2018 were collected from three hospitals in three regions of China. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on all isolates. Whole genome sequencing was applied to all isolates to assess their genomic diversity and relationships and detect the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) and ARG cassettes.\n\nFindings\nNearly all isolates (96.2%, 250/260) showed multidrug-resistance. Genome sequencing revealed four major lineages with lineage IV emerging as the epidemic lineage. Most of the diversity was developed in the last six years. Each hospital has its own predominant clones with potential spread between Hebei and Guangdong hospitals. Genomic analysis further revealed multiple ARGs.\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggested that four lineages of C. striatum have spread in parallel across China, causing persistent and extensive transmissions within hospitals. MDR C. striatum infection has become a national epidemic. Antibiotic-driven selection pressure may have played significant roles in forming persistent and predominant clones. Our data provide the basis for surveillance and prevention strategies to control the epidemic caused by MDR C. striatum.","authors":["Xuebing Wang","Haijian Zhou","Pengcheng Du","Ruiting Lan"],"meta":["November 2020The Journal of hospital infection 110","DOI:10.1016/j.jhin.2020.10.005"],"references":["334521657_Whole-Genome_Sequencing_Reveals_a_Prolonged_and_Persistent_Intrahospital_Transmission_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_an_Emerging_Multidrug-Resistant_Pathogen","313147909_Detection_of_Multiple_Parallel_Transmission_Outbreak_of_Streptococcus_suis_Human_Infection_by_Use_of_Genome_Epidemiology_China_2005","311566753_Susceptibility_to_Aminoglycosides_and_Distribution_of_aph_and_aac3-XI_Genes_among_Corynebacterium_striatum_Clinical_Isolates","309567441_Multidrug-Resistant_Corynebacterium_striatum_Associated_with_Increased_Use_of_Parenteral_Antimicrobial_Drugs","308548535_Native_Valve_Endocarditis_due_to_Corynebacterium_striatum_confirmed_by_16S_Ribosomal_RNA_Sequencing_A_Case_Report_and_Literature_Review","236968959_Minimum_Core_Genome_Sequence_Typing_of_Bacterial_Pathogens_a_Unified_Approach_for_Clinical_and_Public_Health_Microbiology","40696508_De_novo_assembly_of_human_genomes_with_massively_parallel_short_read_sequencing","23713264_Clonal_Multidrug-Resistant_Corynebacterium_striatum_Strains_Italy","23658128_Nosocomial_valve_endocarditis_due_to_Corynebacterium_striatum_a_case_report","15652407_Phylogenetic_Analysis_of_the_Genus_Corynebacterium_Based_on_16S_rRNA_Gene_Sequences","14254516_Corynebacterium_striatum_Meningitis_Case_Report_and_Review_of_an_Increasingly_Important_Corynebacterium_Species","14214130_Clinical_Microbiology_of_Coryneform_Bacteria","7883488_Relationship_between_Mutations_in_the_gyrA_Gene_and_Quinolone_Resistance_in_Clinical_Isolates_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_and_Corynebacterium_amycolatum","7389307_ISfinder_The_reference_centre_for_bacterial_insertion_sequences","6413171_Nosocomial_Outbreak_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_Infection_in_Patients_with_Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease","5624969_SOAP_Short_Oligonucleotide_Alignment_Program","338432096_Prevalence_of_fluoroquinolone_macrolide_and_sulfonamide-related_resistance_genes_in_landfills_from_East_China_mainly_driven_by_MGEs","338414683_Clinical_microbiology_of_coryneform_bacteria","319344547_When_Good_Bugs_Go_Bad_Epidemiology_and_Antimicrobial_Resistance_Profiles_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_an_Emerging_Multidrug_Resistant_Opportunistic_Pathogen","308302469_Clinical_and_bacteriological_analyses_of_bacteremia_due_to_Corynebacterium_striatum","302342160_BLAST_architecture_and_applications","275410470_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools","263935158_Recurrent_Breast_Abscess_in_a_33-Year-Old_Woman","236183271_Epidemiological_investigation_of_a_nosocomial_outbreak_of_multidrug-resistant_Corynebacterium_striatum_at_one_Belgian_university_hospital","233999856_Non-diphtheriae_Corynebacterium_species_An_emerging_respiratory_pathogen","230781090_Microbiological_investigation_and_clinical_significance_of_Corynebacterium_spp_in_respiratory_specimens","220263165_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools","51525654_Multidrug-resistant_extensively_drug-resistant_and_pandrug-resistant_bacteria_An_international_expert_proposal_for_interim_standard_definitions_for_acquired_resistance","15370148_Expression_and_identification_of_the_strA-strB_gene_pair_from_streptomycin-resistant_Erwinia_amylovora","15309763_Native_Valve_Endocarditis_Due_to_Corynebacterium_striatum_Case_Report_and_Review","14343341_Patient_to_patient_spread_of_single_strain_of_Corynebacterium_striatum_causing_infections_in_a_surgical_intensive_care_unit","12582881_The_51409-bp_R-plasmid_pTP10_from_the_multiresistant_clinical_isolate_Corynebacterium_striatum_M82B_is_composed_of_DNA_segments_initially_identified_in_soil_bacteria_and_in_plant_animal_and_human_path","7366194_Emergence_of_multidrug-resistant_Corynebacterium_striatum_as_a_nosocomial_pathogen_in_long-term_hospitalized_patients_with_underlying_diseases","6119927_Outbreak_of_multi-resistant_Corynebacterium_striatum_infection_in_an_Italian_general_intensive_care_unit"]}
