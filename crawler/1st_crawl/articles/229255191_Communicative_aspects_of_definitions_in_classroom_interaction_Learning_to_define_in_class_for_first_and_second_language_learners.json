The classes that were chosen are classes which consisted solely or for a large part of second language learners, as definitions might have a special importance for them in their second language acquisition. Three categories of definitions will be analyzed: teacher definitions, pupil definitions and jointly formulated definitions. It will be shown that teacher definitions have a very important communicative function. They help the pupils grasp the words and the worlds associated with them. Pupil definitions on the other hand – like most pupil utterances in classroom interaction – often have a completely different communicative function: their main goal is to express the pupil's knowledge.As far as the interactive structure of the definitions is concerned, there appears to be a huge difference between teacher definitions and pupil definitions. Teacher definitions resemble dictionary definitions most. A pupil definition on the other hand is mostly not a one-liner by one person. It often develops into a jointly formulated definition, which is a process of information exchange between teacher and pupil, in the course of which the definition is being built up gradually.","authors":["Martina Temmerman"],"meta":["June 2009Linguistics and Education 20(2):126-144","DOI:10.1016/j.linged.2009.04.003"],"references":["32885258_Triadic_Dialogue_in_Oral_Communication_Tasks_What_are_the_Implications_for_Language_Learning","293206135_Contextualization_and_understanding","287827237_Sociocultural_contexts_of_language_development_in_Beyond_language_Social_and_cultural_factors_in_schooling_language_minority_children","287237597_Language_in_Late_Modernity_Interaction_in_an_Urban_School","285360698_Contextualization_and_understanding_Rethmkmg_context","270240234_Bilingualism_and_Special_Education_Issues_in_Assessment_and_Pedagogy","270238227_The_Development_of_Word_Definitions_in_Children","256590067_Adult-child_discourse_Outline_of_a_model_of_analysis","249237199_Definitions_in_Science_Lectures","248451370_Pragmatic_modifications_on_the_'representative'_speech_act_of_defining","244422629_Creating_Effective_Definitions_for_Young_Word_Learners","242459713_Towards_an_Analysis_of_Discourse_The_English_Used_by_Teachers_and_Pupils","238322975_Sociocultural_contexts_of_language_development","233642664_Dutch_Anaphoric_Dat_in_Definitions","232400100_Are_you_human_beings_Order_and_knowledge_construction_through_questioning_in_primary_classroom_interaction","44434264_Ways_with_words_language_life_and_work_in_communities_and_classrooms_Shirley_Brice_Heath"]}
