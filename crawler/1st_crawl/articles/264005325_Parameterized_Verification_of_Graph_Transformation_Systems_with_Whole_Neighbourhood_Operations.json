{"id":"264005325_Parameterized_Verification_of_Graph_Transformation_Systems_with_Whole_Neighbourhood_Operations","abstract":"We introduce a new class of graph transformation systems in which rewrite\nrules can be guarded by universally quantified conditions on the neighbourhood\nof nodes. These conditions are defined via special graph patterns which may be\ntransformed by the rule as well. For the new class for graph rewrite rules, we\nprovide a symbolic procedure working on minimal representations of upward\nclosed sets of configurations. We prove correctness and effectiveness of the\nprocedure by a categorical presentation of rewrite rules as well as the\ninvolved order, and using results for well-structured transition systems. We\napply the resulting procedure to the analysis of the Distributed Dining\nPhilosophers protocol on an arbitrary network structure.","authors":["Giorgio Delzanno","Jan St√ºckrath"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-11439-2_6","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Workshop on Reachability Problems"],"references":["266345725_On_the_Complexity_of_Parameterized_Reachability_in_Reconfigurable_Broadcast_Networks","264848138_On_the_Decidability_Status_of_Reachability_and_Coverability_in_Graph_Transformation_Systems","243769368_Well_structured_transition_systems_everywhere_Theoretical_Computer_Science","290635199_Uncovering_Symmetries_in_Irregular_Process_Networks","278690979_Verification_of_Directed_Acyclic_Ad_Hoc_Networks","267080404_Decidability_and_Complexity_Results_for_Verification_of_Asynchronous_Broadcast_Networks","264928034_Parameterized_Verification_of_Broadcast_Networks_of_Register_Automata","263237697_A_General_Framework_for_Well-Structured_Graph_Transformation_Systems","242910683_Subgraphs_and_well-quasi-ordering","228989595_Adaptive_star_grammars_and_their_languages"]}
