{"id":"265442307_Algebraic_Simplification","abstract":"Some basic techniques for the simplification of terms are surveyed. In two introductory sections the problem of canonical algebraic simplification is formally stated and some elementary facts are derived that explain the fundamental role of simplification in computer algebra. In the subsequent sections two major groups of simplification techniques are presented: special techniques for simplifying terms over numerical domains and completion algorithms for simplification with respect to sets of equations. Within the first group canonical simplification algorithms for polynomials, rational expressions, radical expressions and transcendental expressions are treated (Sections 3–7). As examples for completion algorithms the Knuth-Bendix algorithm for rewrite rules and an algorithm for completing bases of polynomial ideals are described (Sections 8–11).","authors":["Bruno Buchberger","Ruediger Loos"],"meta":["January 1983","DOI:10.1007/978-3-7091-7551-4_2"],"references":["319394137_Resolution_d'Equations_dans_des_Langages_d'ordre_12w","262210872_Simplification_of_radical_expressions","238732204_On_the_uniform_halting_problem_for_term_rewriting_systems","321877962_On_the_Integration_of_Algebraic_Functions","319394655_Equations_and_Rewrite_Rules_A_Survey","319393600_A_Course_in_Mathematical_Logic","305261446_Determining_the_Equivalence_of_Algebraic_Expressions_by_Hash_Coding","305260056_Algebraic_Simplification_A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed","295608601_ANALYSIS_OF_CONSTRUCTED_MATHEMATICAL_RESPONSES_BY_NUMERIC_TESTS_FOR_EQUIVALENCE","284514280_ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPES_AS_INITIAL_ALGEBRAS_THE_CORRECTNESS_OF_DATA_REPRESENTATIONS","268827624_Exponential_Diophantine_Representation_of_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets","268493360_Algebra_of_Polynomials","266227070_A_Canonical_Basis_for_the_Ideals_of_a_Polynomial_Domain","265505460_How_to_prove_algebraic_inductive_hypotheses_without_induction_with_applications_to_the_correctness_of_data_type_implementation","257000639_Ideals_inZx_y","256257710_On_constructing_bases_for_ideals_in_polynomial_rings_over_the_integers","255681534_On_solving_systems_of_algebraic_equations_via_ideal_bases_and_elimination_theory","250916555_Some_properties_of_conversion","250765174_Heterogeneous_Algebras","248415929_Well-founded_orderings_for_proving_termination_of_systems_of_rewrite_rules","247589871_SOME_SIMPLE_WORD_PROBLEMS_IN_UNIVERSAL_ALGEBRAS","247048989_On_the_termination_of_Markov_algorithms","244953977_A_computer_application_to_finite_p-groups","244444568_The_Diamond_lemma_for_ring_theory","243071791_Transcendental_Numbers_and_Diophantine_Approximations","243002226_Uber_B_Buchbergers_Verfahren_Systeme_algebraischer_Gleichungen_zu_losen","242682490_Hilbert's_Tenth_Problem_is_Unsolvable","242637564_Decision_procedures_for_simple_equational_theories_with_commutative-associative_axioms_complete_sets_of_commutative-associative_reductions","242609210_The_Problem_of_Integration_in_Finite_Terms","242606257_Computational_logic_The_unification_computation","242541752_Code_optimization_and_finite_church-rosser_theorems","242530250_Toward_a_formal_implementation_of_computer_algebra","242529411_Canonical_algebraic_simplification_in_computational_logic","242503288_An_on-line_system_for_algebraic_manipulation_ph","242462788_The_Decision_Problem_for_Exponential_Diophantine_Equations","242411703_A_recursively_defined_ordering_for_proving_termination_of_term_rewriting_systems","242403284_A_simple_explanation_of_inductionless_induction","242373361_On_Theories_with_a_Combinatorial_Definition_of_Equivalence","242328601_A_data_type_verification_system_based_on_rewrite_rules","240241458_Simplifi_cation_of_radicals_with_applications_to_solving_polynomial_equations","239595674_The_sac-1_polynomial_system","239591974_Building_in_equational_theories","239555190_An_on-line_algebraic_simplify_program","238873379_Constructions_in_Algebra","238759591_Rational_Exponential_Expressions_and_a_Conjecture_Concerning_p_and_e","238384275_Diophantine_representation_of_enumerable_predicates","235942018_Symbolic_Mathematical_Computation","235021801_A_Catalogue_of_Canonical_Term_Rewriting_Systems","234827085_Equations_and_Rewrite_Rules_A_Survey","234824567_A_new_REDUCE_model_for_algebraic_simplification","234819901_A_Simplified_Proof_of_the_Characterization_Theorem_for_Grobner-Bases","234820871_On_the_Problem_of_Recognizing_Zero","234819482_Attempts_in_local_simplification_of_non_nested_radicals","234813174_Qualitative_analysis_of_mathematical_expressions_using_computer_symbolic_mathematics","234811678_Symbolic_and_algebraic_computer_programming_systems"]}
