{"id":"321015941_A_flexible_design_methodology_to_solve_energy_management_problems","abstract":"This paper investigates the design and simplification of energy management problems (EMP) through a dedicated functional model for energy systems. The proposed framework extends the concept of energy-hub by adding a layer of information based on standardized communication ports. As a result, the EMP can be expressed directly from the model as a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem. Taking advantage of the modularity of the approach, methods to substantially reduce EMP complexity are proposed: one manages the energy demands based on a discrete set of precomputed local regulators (configurations); another decomposes the problem using an appropriate set of sub-problems. The framework and the methodology are shown to be flexible and efficient through the case study of a hybrid serial refrigerating truck.","authors":["Clement Fauvel","Fabien Claveau","Philippe Chevrel","Philippe Fiani"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems 97","DOI:10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.11.005"],"references":["267870161_Optimal_management_of_hybrid_PVfuel_cellbattery_power_system_A_comparison_of_optimal_hybrid_approaches","260019865_Optimization_of_an_off-grid_hybrid_PV-Wind-Diesel_system_with_different_battery_technologies_using_genetic_algorithm","260008147_MES_multi-energy_systems_An_overview_of_concepts_and_evaluation_models","224161868_Real-Time_Energy_Management_of_a_Stand-Alone_Hybrid_Wind-Microturbine_Energy_System_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","221661510_Game_Theoretic_Methods_for_the_Smart_Grid","220539024_Optimal_Control_of_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles_Based_on_Pontryagin's_Minimum_Principle","318692801_An_efficient_cost-reliability_optimization_model_for_optimal_siting_and_sizing_of_energy_storage_system_in_a_microgrid_in_the_presence_of_responsible_load_management","317325493_A_cost-emission_framework_for_hub_energy_system_under_demand_response_program","299405190_Optimization_framework_for_distributed_energy_systems_with_integrated_electrical_grid_constraints","294579333_Optimal_planning_and_scheduling_of_energy_hub_in_presence_of_wind_storage_and_demand_response_under_uncertainty","284078149_Multiple_energy_carrier_optimisation_with_intelligent_agents","273697254_Energy_Management_in_Multi-Consumers_Multi-Sources_System_A_Practical_Framework","271559906_A_robust_optimization_approach_to_energy_hub_management","260586133_Power_Smoothing_Energy_Management_and_Its_Application_to_a_Series_Hybrid_Powertrain","260523784_A_Decomposed_Solution_to_Multiple-Energy_Carriers_Optimal_Power_Flow","224192930_Autonomous_Demand-Side_Management_Based_on_Game-Theoretic_Energy_Consumption_Scheduling_for_the_Future_Smart_Grid","223002997_Paradigm_shift_in_urban_energy_systems_through_distributed_generation_Methods_and_models","222530957_Intelligent_unit_commitment_with_vehicle-to-grid_-A_cost-emission_optimization","222324236_Stochastic_economic_emission_load_dispatch_through_a_modified_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","4128133_Power_management_strategy_based_on_game_theory_for_fuel_cell_hybrid_electric_vehicles","3438487_Energy_hubs_for_the_future","3267799_Optimal_Power_Flow_of_Multiple_Energy_Carriers"]}
