{"id":"279896083_A_Privacy_Preservation_Model_for_Health-Related_Social_Networking_Sites","abstract":"The increasing use of social networking sites (SNS) in health care has resulted in a growing number of individuals posting personal health information online. These sites may disclose users' health information to many different individuals and organizations and mine it for a variety of commercial and research purposes, yet the revelation of personal health information to unauthorized individuals or entities brings a concomitant concern of greater risk for loss of privacy among users. Many users join multiple social networks for\ndifferent purposes and enter personal and other specific information covering social, professional, and health domains into other websites. Integration of multiple online and real social networks makes the users vulnerable to unintentional and intentional security threats and misuse. This paper analyzes the privacy and security characteristics of leading health-related SNS. It presents a threat model and identifies the most important threats to users and SNS providers. Building on threat analysis and modeling, this paper presents a privacy preservation model that incorporates individual self-protection and privacy-by-design approaches and uses the model to develop principles and countermeasures to protect user privacy. This study paves the way for analysis and design of privacypreserving mechanisms on health-related SNS.","authors":["Li Jingquan"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Medical Internet Research 17(7)","DOI:10.2196/jmir.3973"],"references":["262561757_Integrating_and_Mining_Virtual_Communities_across_Multiple_Online_Social_Networks_Concepts_Approaches_and_Challenges","262339267_Anonymity_Versus_Privacy_Selective_Information_Sharing_in_Online_Cancer_Communities","261283276_Online_multiple_profile_manager_for_eHealth_information_sharing","258034359_Sociotechnical_Challenges_and_Progress_in_Using_Social_Media_for_Health","257885092_Social_network_integration_and_analysis_using_a_generalization_and_probabilistic_approach_for_privacy_preservation","257349011_Can_Anonymous_Posters_on_Medical_Forums_be_Reidentified","236228331_Privacy_policies_for_health_social_networking_sites_Table_1","233931066_Privacy-preserving_heterogeneous_health_data_sharing","228441975_Not_all_my_friends_need_to_know_A_qualitative_study_of_teenage_patients_privacy_and_social_media","228070489_Building_public_trust_in_uses_of_Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act_de-identified_data","226656635_Decentralized_Social_Networking_Services","221866652_De-identification_Methods_for_Open_Health_Data_The_Case_of_the_Heritage_Health_Prize_Claims_Dataset","49694302_Never_too_old_for_anonymity_A_statistical_standard_for_demographic_data_sharing_via_the_HIPAA_Privacy_Rule","27297739_Privacy_Information_Technology_and_Health_Care","3437667_Privacy_and_rationality_in_individual_decision_making","288093122_Controllable_Information_Sharing_for_User_Accounts_Linkage_across_Multiple_Online_Social_Networks","273393670_Ensuring_Privacy_in_a_Personal_Health_Record_System","260526167_Data_Protection_in_Healthcare_Social_Networks","236835376_Improving_Chronic_Disease_Self-Management_through_Social_Networks","234827580_Social_networking_applications_in_health_care_Threats_to_the_privacy_and_security_of_health_information","234818903_Characterizing_Privacy_in_Online_Social_Networks","224180032_Social_networks_for_health_care_Addressing_regulatory_gaps_with_privacy-by-design","222047459_Privacy_threat_model_for_data_portability_in_social_network_applications","220520113_A_Brief_Survey_on_Anonymization_Techniques_for_Privacy_Preserving_Publishing_of_Social_Network_Data","26331688_A_Globally_Optimal_k-Anonymity_Method_for_the_De-Identification_of_Health_Data","24191179_Privacy_As_An_Enabler_Not_An_Impediment_Building_Trust_Into_Health_Information_Exchange","4339941_Robust_De-anonymization_of_Large_Sparse_Datasets"]}
