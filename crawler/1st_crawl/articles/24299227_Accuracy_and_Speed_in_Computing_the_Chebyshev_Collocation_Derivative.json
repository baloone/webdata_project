{"id":"24299227_Accuracy_and_Speed_in_Computing_the_Chebyshev_Collocation_Derivative","abstract":"We studied several algorithms for computing the Chebyshev spectral derivative and compare their roundoff error. For a large number of collocation points, the elements of the Chebyshev differentiation matrix, if constructed in the usual way, are not computed accurately. A subtle cause is is found to account for the poor accuracy when computing the derivative by the matrix-vector multiplication method. Methods for accurately computing the elements of the matrix are presented, and we find that if the entities of the matrix are computed accurately, the roundoff error of the matrix-vector multiplication is as small as that of the transform-recursion algorithm. Results of CPU time usage are shown for several different algorithms for computing the derivative by the Chebyshev collocation method for a wide variety of two-dimensional grid sizes on both an IBM and a Cray 2 computer. We found that which algorithm is fastest on a particular machine depends not only on the grid size, but also on small details of the computer hardware as well. For most practical grid sizes used in computation, the even-odd decomposition algorithm is found to be faster than the transform-recursion method.","authors":["Wai Sun Don","Alex Solomonoff"],"meta":["November 1995SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 16(6):1253-1268","DOI:10.1137/0916073","SourceNTRS"],"references":["284239232_Reducing_round-off_error_in_Chebyshev_pseudospectral_computations","265460930_Spectral_methods_in_fluid_dynamics_2nd_corr_printing","265449023_Numerical_analysis_of_spectral_methods_Theory_and_applications","253533009_An_Instability_Phenomenon_in_Spectral_Methods","222486224_On_the_errors_incurred_calculating_derivatives_using_Chebyshev_polynomials","216756208_Spectral_Methods_in_Fluid_Dynamic","23596004_A_fast_algorithm_for_spectral_differentiation"]}
