{"id":"267924536_Implementation_of_an_efficient_workflow_process_for_gel_dosimetry_using_3D_Slicer","abstract":"One challenge in gel dosimetry is the manipulation and analysis of complex data sets from different systems. In this paper, we describe a simple and fast gel dosimetry analysis tool for radiation therapy dose deliveries. Using the open source medical imaging software 3D Slicer, an extension was designed and implemented for the purpose of importing treatment planning system dose, CT imaging from simulation and at treatment, and optical CT gel dosimeter data. The extension also allows for calibration of gel dosimeter data, registration, and comparison of 3D dose distributions. The development of an open source gel dosimetry processing environment may help adoption of gels in the clinic.","authors":["Km Alexander","Csaba Pinter","J Andrea","Gabor Fichtinger"],"meta":["September 2014Journal of Physics Conference Series 573(1)","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/573/1/012042","Conference: IC3DDoseAt: Ystad, Sweden","Project: Current Research: Cobalt radiation delivery and 3D dosimetry"],"references":["314051672_Polymer_gel_dosimetry","260833106_Stereotactic_body_radiation_therapy_delivery_validation","243673030_Historical_overview_of_the_development_of_gel_dosimetry_A_personal_perspective","38027881_Radiochromic_leuco_dye_micelle_hydrogels_I_Initial_investigation"]}
