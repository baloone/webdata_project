{"id":"313893529_Protection_Number_in_Plane_Trees","abstract":"The protection number of a plane tree is the minimal distance of the root to a leaf; this definition carries over to an arbitrary node in a plane tree by considering the maximal subtree having this node as a root. We study the the protection number of a uniformly chosen random tree of size $n$ and also the protection number of a uniformly chosen node in a uniformly chosen random tree of size $n$. The method is to apply singularity analysis to appropriate generating functions. Additional results are provided as well.","authors":["Clemens Heuberger","Prodinger Helmut"],"meta":["February 2017Applicable Analysis and Discrete Mathematics 11(2)","DOI:10.2298/AADM1702314H"],"references":["303749784_k-Protected_Vertices_in_Unlabeled_Rooted_Plane_Trees","257299329_Protected_nodes_and_fringe_subtrees_in_some_random_trees","251283457_Zur_Auswertung_Gewisser_Numerischer_Reihen_Mit_Hilfe_Modularer_Funktionen","230805956_Protected_points_in_k-ary_trees","228406241_Periodic_oscillations_in_the_analysis_of_algorithms-and_their_cancellations","276083687_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Protected_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","261065509_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_ternary_search_trees","236263770_K-Protected_vertices_in_binary_search_trees","235118572_The_Average_Height_of_Planted_Plane_Trees","222477553_Mellin_Transforms_and_Asymptotics_Harmonic_Sums"]}
