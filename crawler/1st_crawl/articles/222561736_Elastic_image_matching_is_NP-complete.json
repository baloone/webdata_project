{"id":"222561736_Elastic_image_matching_is_NP-complete","abstract":"One fundamental problem in image recognition is to establish the resemblance of two images. This can be done by searching the best pixel to pixel mapping taking into account monotonicity and continuity constraints. We show that this problem is NP-complete by reduction from 3-SAT, thus giving evidence that the known exponential time algorithms are justified, but approximation algorithms or simplifications are necessary.","authors":["Daniel Keysers","Walter Unger"],"meta":["January 2003Pattern Recognition Letters 24(1-3):445-453","DOI:10.1016/S0167-8655(02)00268-4","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["303384402_Face_recognition_using_Hidden_Markov_Models","3916865_Handwritten_character_recognition_using_piecewise_linear_two-dimensional_warping","3887890_Experiments_with_an_extended_tangent_distance","3887574_Piecewise_linear_two-dimensional_warping","3817385_Handwritten_character_recognition_using_monotonic_and_continuous_two-dimensional_warping","3765021_Monotonic_and_continuous_two-dimensional_warping_based_on_dynamic_programming","3532347_Dynamic_planar_warping_for_optical_character_recognition","2824077_An_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Two-Dimensional_Warping","2446490_An_Efficient_Two-Dimensional_Warping_Algorithm","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","224377453_A_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_the_Distance_Between_Two_Finite_Areas","221113845_Variational_Image_Motion_Computation_Theoretical_Framework_Problems_and_Perspectives","220695896_Graph_Drawing_Algorithms_for_the_Visualization_of_Graphs","220644311_Optimal_linguistic_decoding_is_a_difficult_computational_problem","3659896_A_Bayesian_similarity_measure_for_direct_image_matching","3314303_Data_Driven_Search_Organization_for_Continuous_Speech_Recognition","3192323_Keyword_Spotting_in_Poorly_Printed_Documents_using_Pseudo_2-D_Hidden_Markov_Models","2915962_A_Super_Fast_Registration_Algorithm","2787408_Graph_Drawing_'93"]}
