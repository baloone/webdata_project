Neck extensions to several vertical postures occurred most often. Winners extended,their heads higher than losers. Gapes and bite attempts occurred frequently, but physical contact was rarely observed. Males were dominant over fe- males, and contacts between females were uncommon. Saddle-backed tortoises contacted one another more,often and performed,neck,extensions and gapes more,often than dome-shelled tortoises. Dominance,in saddle-backed tortoises was related to shell shape and neck and limb length. The saddle-backed morphology,appeared,to increase the effectiveness of ritualized fight- ing.","authors":["Susan F. Schafer","C.
