{"id":"339954593_Quantum_image_steganography_algorithm_based_on_modified_exploiting_modification_direction_embedding","abstract":"A novel quantum steganography scheme is investigated based on efficient embedding algorithm of modified exploiting modification direction in this paper, which embeds two \\( 2^{n} \\times 2^{n} \\) binary images (secret information) into a \\( 2^{n} \\times 2^{n} \\) color image (carrier image). To improve the security of the secret information and enhance the robustness of the proposed scheme, a \\( 2^{n} \\times 2^{n} \\) binary image (secret key) is generated according to the exclusive or operation of two secret images. The secret key acts as the control key of choosing two channels from the carrier imageâ€™s three channels of R, G and B (i.e., R, G or R, B channels chose as the pixel-group) to hide the secret information. In addition, the effective quantum circuits for investigated quantum steganography scheme are illustrated to better understanding the procedure of embedding algorithm. The experiment results simulated on the classical computer with MATLAB environment, and the numerical analyses demonstrate that the presented algorithm has good performance on imperceptibility and security.","authors":["Wen-Wen Hu","Ri-Gui Zhou","Xing-Ao Liu","Jia Luo"],"meta":["March 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-020-02641-5"],"references":["335424468_Quantum_Image_Watermarking_Algorithm_Based_on_Haar_Wavelet_Transform","326953632_A_novel_quantum_image_steganography_algorithm_based_on_exploiting_modification_direction","325304317_Quantum_realization_of_the_nearest_neighbor_value_interpolation_method_for_INEQR","323665525_A_Novel_Quantum_Image_Steganography_Scheme_Based_on_LSB","319233095_A_novel_quantum_LSB-based_steganography_method_using_the_Gray_code_for_colored_quantum_images","318833507_Quantum_red-green-blue_image_steganography","330318341_QRCI_A_new_quantum_representation_model_of_color_digital_images","327850482_A_Quantum_Image_Representation_Based_on_Bitplanes","326562895_Quantum_Implementation_Circuits_of_Quantum_Signal_Representation_and_Type_Conversion","323739748_A_novel_quantum_steganography_scheme_for_color_images","318578794_Quantum_watermarking_scheme_through_Arnold_scrambling_and_LSB_steganography","315941002_Quantum_image_processing_A_review_of_advances_in_its_security_technologies","311962365_A_novel_quantum_representation_of_color_digital_images","306295622_Least_significant_qubit_algorithm_for_quantum_images","312888624_Efficient_steganographic_embedding_by_exploiting_modification_direction"]}
