{"id":"286513259_Progress_Towards_the_Total_Domination_Game_frac34-Conjecture","abstract":"In this paper, we continue the study of the total domination game in graphs\nintroduced in [Graphs Combin. 31(5) (2015), 1453--1462], where the players\nDominator and Staller alternately select vertices of $G$. Each vertex chosen\nmust strictly increase the number of vertices totally dominated, where a vertex\ntotally dominates another vertex if they are neighbors. This process eventually\nproduces a total dominating set $S$ of $G$ in which every vertex is totally\ndominated by a vertex in $S$. Dominator wishes to minimize the number of\nvertices chosen, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The game total domination\nnumber, $\\gamma_{\\rm tg}(G)$, of $G$ is the number of vertices chosen when\nDominator starts the game and both players play optimally. Henning, Klav\\v{z}ar\nand Rall [Combinatorica, to appear] posted the $\\frac{3}{4}$-Game Total\nDomination Conjecture that states that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices in\nwhich every component contains at least three vertices, then $\\gamma_{\\rm\ntg}(G) \\le \\frac{3}{4}n$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture over the\nclass of graphs $G$ that satisfy both the condition that the degree sum of\nadjacent vertices in $G$ is at least $4$ and the condition that no two vertices\nof degree $1$ are at distance $4$ apart in $G$. In particular, we prove that by\nadopting a greedy strategy, Dominator can complete the total domination game\nplayed in a graph with minimum degree at least $2$ in at most $3n/4$ moves.","authors":["Michael A.
