{"id":"241178541_A_self-adaptive_nonuniformity_correction_algorithm_for_infrared_images_combined_with_two-point_correction_along_the_rim","abstract":"Nonuniformity correction plays an important role in improving image quality of the infrared focal plane array. A self-adaptive nonuniformity correction algorithm for infrared images combined with two-point correction along the rim is proposed in this paper. With the help of perimeter blackbody in low and high temperature, two-point correction is executed initially to perimeter detectors. Then based on the scene information and shift between adjacent frames, a special algebraic algorithm is proposed to transport correction parameters from perimeter detectors to those interior un-corrected ones. In this way, the correction parameters of the whole field of view (FOV) are calculated. All calculations are algebraic, with a low computation load. This algorithm can realize adaptive two-point correction without covering the central FOV rapidly. It proves to get a satisfying correction effect after being tested by using real infrared images.","authors":["Chongliang Liu","Weiqi Jin","Yan Chen","Bin Liu"],"meta":["December 2010","DOI:10.1109/COMPSYM.2010.5685510"],"references":["231585357_Radiometrically_accurate_scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_for_array_sensors","290545821_New_dynamic_algorithm_for_IRFPA_bad_pixel_detection_and_compensation_based_on_statistics","253435510_Summarize_on_the_scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_algorithms_for_IRFPA","243481900_Nonuniformity_two-point_linear_correction_errors_in_infrared_focal_plane_arrays","234250243_Linear_theory_of_nonuniformity_correction_in_infrared_staring_sensors","216809451_A_scene-based_non-uniformity_correction_technique_for_IRFPA_using_perimeter_diaphragm_strips"]}
