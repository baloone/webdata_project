{"id":"345971587_Optimized_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_Realization_of_an_Enhanced_Energy-Aware_Location-Aided_Routing_Protocol_in_MANET","abstract":"Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANETs) is a wireless network topology with mobile network nodes and movable communication routes. In addition, the network nodes in MANETs are free to either join or leave the network. Typically, routing in MANETs is multi-hop because of the limited communication range of nodes. Then, routing protocols have been developed for MANETs. Among them, energy-aware location-aided routing (EALAR) is an efficient reactive MANET routing protocol that has been recently obtained by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with mutation operation into the conventional LAR protocol. However, the mutation operation (nonuniform) used in EALAR has some drawbacks, which make EALAR provide insufficient exploration, exploitation, and diversity of solutions. Therefore, this study aims to propose to apply the Optimized PSO (OPSO) via adopting a mutation operation (uniform) instead of nonuniform. The OPSO is integrated into the LAR protocol to enhance all critical performance metrics, including packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, overhead, and end-to-end delay.","authors":["Taj-Aldeen Naser Abdali","Rosilah Hassan","Ravie Chandren Muniyandi","Azana Hafizah Mohd Aman"],"meta":["November 2020Information (Switzerland) 11(11)","DOI:10.3390/info11110529","Project: Ad Hoc Networks in the Internet of Things"],"references":["343782575_Genetic_Optimized_Location_Aided_Routing_Protocol_for_VANET_Based_on_Rectangular_Estimation_of_Position","340091859_Power_Consumption_Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Forest_Fire_Detection_based_on_Mobile_Sensor_Networks","339745554_An_Adaptive_on-Demand_Multipath_Routing_Protocol_With_QoS_Support_for_High-Speed_MANET","337303091_Bat_Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol_for_Energy-Aware_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","336375660_A_Study_Review_on_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Network_Characteristics_Applications_Challenges_and_Routing_Protocols_Classification","335843016_A_review_of_forest_fire_surveillance_technologies_Mobile_ad-hoc_network_routing_protocols_perspective","340969465_Extensible_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Technique_Using_Route_Set_Choosing_Algorithm_in_MANET","340353473_Delay_differential_equations_modeling_of_rumor_propagation_in_both_homogeneous_and_heterogeneous_networks_with_a_forced_silence_function","336952796_Role_of_Bio-Inspired_Algorithms_for_Designing_Protocols_in_MANET-Review","336105169_Survey_Paper_on_Routing_in_MANETs_for_Optimal_Route_Selection_Based_on_Routing_Protocol_with_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_and_Different_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Protocol"]}
