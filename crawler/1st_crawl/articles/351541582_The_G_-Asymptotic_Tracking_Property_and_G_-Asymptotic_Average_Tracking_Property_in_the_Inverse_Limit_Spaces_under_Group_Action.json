{"id":"351541582_The_G_-Asymptotic_Tracking_Property_and_G_-Asymptotic_Average_Tracking_Property_in_the_Inverse_Limit_Spaces_under_Group_Action","abstract":"Firstly, we introduce the definitions of G-asymptotic tracking property, G-asymptotic average tracking property, and G-quasi-weak almost-periodic point. Secondly, we study their dynamical properties and characteristics. The results obtained improve the conclusions of asymptotic tracking property, asymptotic average tracking property, and quasi-weak almost-periodic point in the inverse limit space and provide the theoretical basis and scientific foundation for the application of tracking property in computational mathematics, biological mathematics, and computer science.","authors":["Zhanjiang Ji"],"meta":["May 2021Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 2021(4):1-6","DOI:10.1155/2021/5576389"],"references":["273916870_Some_remarks_on_d_-shadowing_property","267067589_Consequences_of_Shadowing_Property_of_G-spaces","243963794_On_almost_specification_and_average_shadowing_properties","238870185_Shadowing_Property_for_Inverse_Limit_Spaces","303338714_Shadowing_property_for_inverse_limit_spaces","264948757_Some_properties_about_the_shift_maps_on_the_inverse_limit_spaces","257003646_A_note_on_the_average_shadowing_property_for_expansive_maps","256760582_On_partial_shadowing_of_complete_pseudo-orbits","251474104_The_average-shadowing_property_and_strong_ergodicity","243026103_Sub-shadowings","231873998_Metric_properties_of_e-trajectories_of_dynamical_systems_with_stochastic_behaviour","229356094_The_average-shadowing_property_and_transitivity_for_continuous_flows","228920002_Average_shadowing_properties_on_compact_metric_spaces","222549523_On_shadowing_Ordinary_and_ergodic","222164148_The_asymptotic_average_shadowing_property_and_transitivity"]}
