{"id":"342517968_Grand_challenges_for_the_spatial_information_community","abstract":"The spatial information (SI) community has an opportunity to address major societal and scientific problems including public health, climate change, air pollution, transportation, and others. Beyond the significant contributions made by the SI community, more can be done by focusing the efforts of the community, and generalizing them. Focus can be achieved by an IMAGENET-like spatial information database and competition. Generalization can be achieved by solving spatio-temporal information problems in disciplines such as neuroscience, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and engineering.","authors":["Leye Wang","Ouri Wolfson"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Spatial Information Science","DOI:10.5311/JOSIS.2020.20.667"],"references":["338027364_GeoAI_at_ACM_SIGSPATIAL_progress_challenges_and_future_directions","307816790_Twitter_location_Sometimes_matters_Exploring_the_relationship_between_georeferenced_tweet_content_and_nearby_feature_classes","301879687_Building_Machines_That_Learn_and_Think_Like_People","283432987_A_multi-source_dataset_of_urban_life_in_the_city_of_Milan_and_the_Province_of_Trentino","264561742_4W1H_in_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing","229110178_The_Movebank_data_model_for_animal_tracking","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","220478096_Google_Street_View_Capturing_the_World_at_Street_Level","32896731_OpenStreetMap_User-Generated_Street_Maps","341686499_JUST_JD_Urban_Spatio-Temporal_Data_Engine","337230744_Temporal_Geo-Social_Personalized_Search_Over_Streaming_Data","337229753_Accident_Risk_Prediction_based_on_Heterogeneous_Sparse_Data_New_Dataset_and_Insights","328944419_Understanding_the_human_brain_via_its_spatio-temporal_properties_vision_paper","328944285_Efficient_astronomical_query_processing_using_spark","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","283617540_Co-Planar_Stereotaxic_Atlas_of_the_Human_Brain3-Dimensional_Proportional_System_An_Approach_to_Cerebral_Imaging","277679296_Urban_Computing","269306448_Mercury_A_memory-constrained_spatio-temporal_real-time_search_on_microblogs","262328181_GeoCrowd_Enabling_query_answering_with_spatial_crowdsourcing","223001491_A_distributed_geospatial_infrastructure_for_Sensor_Web","222418660_Integration_of_heterogeneous_geospatial_data_in_a_federated_database","220282575_GeoLife_A_Collaborative_Social_Networking_Service_among_User_Location_and_Trajectory","7757517_Do_we_have_brain_to_spare"]}
