{"id":"309820037_Fast_Approximation_Algorithms_for_p-centers_in_Large_delta_d_-hyperbolic_Graphs","abstract":"We provide a quasilinear time algorithm for the p-center problem with an additive error less than or equal to 3 times the input graphâ€™s hyperbolic constant. Specifically, for the graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) with n vertices, m edges and hyperbolic constant \\(\\delta \\), we construct an algorithm for p-centers in time \\(O(p(\\delta +1)(n+m)\\log _2(n))\\) with radius not exceeding \\(r_p + \\delta \\) when \\(p \\le 2\\) and \\(r_p + 3\\delta \\) when \\(p \\ge 3\\), where \\(r_p\\) are the optimal radii. Prior work identified p-centers with accuracy \\(r_p+\\delta \\) but with time complexity \\(O((n^3\\log _2 n + n^2m)\\log _2({{\\mathrm{diam}}}(G)))\\) which is impractical for large graphs.","authors":["Katherine Edwards","Sean Kennedy","Iraj Saniee"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49787-7_6","Conference: International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph","Project: \\delta-hyperbolic networks"],"references":["301648557_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_p-centres_in_large_delta-hyperbolic_graphs","267868110_Diameters_centers_and_approximating_trees_of_d-hyperbolic_geodesic_spaces_and_graphs","243963660_On_the_Hyperbolicity_of_Large-Scale_Networks","242375515_A_Best_Possible_Heuristic_for_the_k-Center_Problem","225315617_Packing_and_Covering_d-Hyperbolic_Spaces_by_Balls","222445958_A_Simple_Heuristic_for_the_p-Center_Problem","265681744_Hyperbolic_Groups","246815356_Metric_Spaces_of_Non-Positive_Curvature","244958697_A_Min-Max_Theorem_for_p-Center_Problems_on_a_Tree","239469185_Comparison_Of_Four_Models_For_dispersing_Facilities","232346486_Easy_and_Hard_Bottleneck_Location_Problems","225125061_Facility_dispersion_problems_Heuristics_and_special_cases","223091165_The_Discrete_P-Dispersion_Problem","222945342_A_Comparison_of_p-Dispersion_Heuristics","213878731_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Shortest_Paths_in_Sparse_Networks"]}
