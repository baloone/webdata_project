{"id":"250419789_On_the_Complexity_of_Randolph's_Robot_Game","abstract":"Abstract We introduce a type of movement,constraints for a swarm,of robots in a grid environment, which is inspired by Alex Randolphâ€™s board game,Ricochet Robot and new,to the field of robot motion,planning. This type of movement,may,be used to model,robots with very limited abilities for self localization: We assume,that once a robot starts to drive in a certain direction, it does not stop its movement until it hits an obstacle wall or another,robot. We give some,lower bounds,on the number of robots needed to reach every cell. Especially, it is easy to see that three robots are necessary and sufficient to reach every cell in a simple rectangular environment. Further, we consider the question, whether,a certain cell can be reached,is in arbitrary environments. A Java applet for simulating robot swarms,moving,with these constraints can be found in http://www.geometrylab.de/RacingRobots/ Key words: Robot navigation, unknown environment, navigation error, robot swarms, NP-hardness, PSPACE-completeness. 1,Introduction Robot motion,planning has received a lot of attention both in computational","authors":["Birgit Engels","Tom Kamphans"],"meta":[],"references":["226207439_Algorithms_for_Rapidly_Dispersing_Robot_Swarms_in_Unknown_Environments","221561897_Finding_Optimal_Solutions_to_Atomix","279389547_Robot_Motion_Planning","268661157_Algorithmic_motion_planning","247370141_Reducibility_among_combinatorical_problems_of_computer_computaions","247161853_Robot_Motion_Planning","246855619_Models_and_Algorithms_for_Online_Exploration_and_Search","245237440_Algorithmic_and_Geometric_Aspects_of_Robotics","236478108_Advances_in_robotics_Algorithmic_and_geometric_aspects_of_robotics_Volume_1","222545256_Competitive_on-line_coverage_of_grid_environments_by_a_mobile_robot"]}
