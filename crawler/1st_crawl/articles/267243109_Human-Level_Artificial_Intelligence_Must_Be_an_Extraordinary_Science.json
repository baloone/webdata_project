{"id":"267243109_Human-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_Must_Be_an_Extraordinary_Science","abstract":"Aiming to create a cognitive system with human-level intelligence is as different from normal scientific objectives as reaching artificial immortality is to the goals of modern medicine. Most researchers in artificial intelligence, along with the institutions that support them, advocate that AI research should conform to normal scientific standards and methods. I argue that these are often incidental and even antithetical to achieving human-level intelligence and that a different approach is required. In this essay, I propose some principles on which to base such an approach.","authors":["Nicholas L Cassimatis"],"meta":[],"references":["233820788_AI_The_Tumultuous_History_of_the_Search_for_Artificial_Intelligence","14191119_The_Analogical_Mind","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","232485936_Duncker_K_A_qualitative_experimental_and_theoretical_study_of_productive_thinking_solving_of_comprehensible_problems_Pedagogical_Seminary_and_Journal_of_Genetic_Psychology_33_642-708","229068177_Models_of_Man_Social_And_Rational","223714484_Understanding_Natural_Language","221996750_Artificial_Intelligence_-_A_Modern_Approach","220605170_A_Cognitive_Substrate_for_Achieving_Human-Level_Intelligence","220080103_Microcosms_for_testing_common_sense_reasoning_abilities","216301049_Deterministic_Nonperiodic_Flow","2473889_Interpretation_as_Abduction"]}
