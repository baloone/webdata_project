{"id":"342046524_Comparative_Study_of_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_and_its_Applications_in_China_Japan_and_Korea","abstract":"Harmony Search (HS) is a music-inspired optimization algorithm for solving complex optimization problems that imitate the musical improvisational process. This paper reviews the potential of applying the HS algorithm in three countries, China, South Korea, and Japan. The applications represent several disciplines in fields of study such as computer science, mathematics, electrical/electronic, mechanical, chemical, civil, and industrial engineering. We anticipate an increasing number of HS applications from these countries in near future.","authors":["Mohammad Nasir","Ali Sadollah","Jin Hee Yoon","Zong Woo Geem"],"meta":["June 2020Applied Sciences 10(11):3970","DOI:10.3390/app10113970"],"references":["336930389_An_Efficient_Representation_Using_Harmony_Search_for_Solving_the_Virtual_Machine_Consolidation","336834118_Enhanced_harmony_search_algorithm_with_circular_region_perturbation_for_global_optimization_problems","334408657_Japanese_management_and_the_climate_of_the_time","337087926_Optimal_scheduling_model_for_smart_home_energy_management_system_based_on_the_fusion_algorithm_of_harmony_search_algorithm_and_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","336961043_Data-efficient_parameter_identification_of_electrochemical_lithium-ion_battery_model_using_deep_Bayesian_harmony_search","336335162_Japanese_Economic_Growth_an_Overview","335804592_Adaptive_Exploration_Harmony_Search_for_Effective_Parameter_Estimation_in_an_Electrochemical_Lithium-Ion_Battery_Model","335638275_Re-emergence_of_Asia_and_the_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Japanese_Economy_in_Super_Long_Waves_of_Capitalist_World_Systems","335531296_A_harmony_search_variant_and_a_useful_constraint_handling_method_for_the_dynamic_economic_emission_dispatch_problems_considering_transmission_loss","332002213_Review_of_harmony_search_with_respect_to_algorithm_structure"]}
