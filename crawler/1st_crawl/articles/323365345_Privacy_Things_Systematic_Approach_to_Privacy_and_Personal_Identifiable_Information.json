{"id":"323365345_Privacy_Things_Systematic_Approach_to_Privacy_and_Personal_Identifiable_Information","abstract":"Defining privacy and related notions such as Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is a central notion in computer science and other fields. The theoretical, technological, and application aspects of PII require a framework that provides an overview and systematic structure for the discipline's topics. This paper develops a foundation for representing information privacy. It introduces a coherent conceptualization of the privacy senses built upon diagrammatic representation. A new framework is presented based on a flow-based model that includes generic operations performed on PII.","authors":["Sabah Al-Fedaghi"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 16(2)"],"references":["271285013_Experimentation_with_Personal_Identifiable_Information","263725968_Open_Data_Data_Protection_and_Group_Privacy","333020420_17_Identity_and_Anonymity_Some_Conceptual_Distinctions_and_Issues_for_Research","332170173_Privacy_and_Freedom","310822099_Privacy_is_an_essentially_contested_concept_a_multi-dimensional_analytic_for_mapping_privacy_Table_1","284892729_Big_Data_and_Due_Process_Toward_a_Framework_to_Redress_Predictive_Privacy_Harms","281822013_Policy_forum_Data_privacy_and_the_greater_good","274578340_Information_and_Information_Systems","270372626_Naming_and_Reference_the_Link_of_Word_to_Object","262173866_Characterizing_and_predicting_postpartum_depression_from_shared_Facebook_data","261020439_Perceived_Privacy","247253527_Privacy_and_Social_Freedom","243774534_In_Inquiries_Into_Truth_and_Interpretation","243767167_Introduction_to_Dataveillance_and_Information_Privacy_and_Definition_of_Terms","242530382_The_conduit_metaphor_---_a_case_of_frame_conflict_in_our_language_about_language"]}
