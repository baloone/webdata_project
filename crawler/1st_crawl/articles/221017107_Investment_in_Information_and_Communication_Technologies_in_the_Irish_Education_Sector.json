{"id":"221017107_Investment_in_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_in_the_Irish_Education_Sector","abstract":"Ireland's economy has experienced phenomenal growth over the last ten years, in particular in the ICT sector. With today's rising global competition, Ireland faces the challenge of sustaining this growth, particularly in the software sector. A core component of this challenge is to produce a steady stream of qualified graduates in the ICT area. Funded by the Irish government, Lero—the Irish Software Engineering Centre has begun two educational initiatives to address this issue: the establishment of the Lero Graduate School in Software Engineering (LGSSE) and the Lero Education and Outreach Programme. This paper describes both initiatives in detail and their uniqueness in the Irish context.","authors":["Clare Mcinerney","Mike Hinchey","Eamonn Mcquade"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-03115-1_9","SourceDBLP","Conference: Education and Technology for a Better World, 9th IFIP TC 3 World Conference on Computers in Education, WCCE 2009, Bento Gonçalves, Brazil, July 27-31, 2009.
