{"id":"240426917_Zipf's_Law_and_the_Internet","abstract":"Zipf's law governs many features of the Internet. Observations of Zipf distributions, while interesting in and of themselves, have strong implications for the design and function of the Internet. The connectivity of Internet routers influences the robustness of the network while the distribution in the number of email contacts affects the spread of email viruses. Even web caching strategies are formulated to account for a Zipf distribution in the number of requests for webpages.","authors":["Lada A.
