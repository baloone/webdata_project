{"id":"319393279_A_Theory_of_Conditionals","abstract":"This chapter was the first exposition and defense of an axiom system and model theory for a conditional logic in the possible worlds framework, a theory designed to model counterfactual propositions. It is argued, using a version of the Ramsey test, that the truth-conditions for conditionals that are provided can explain why we assess counterfactuals in the way we do. Counterexamples are given for various principles that are often taken to be valid for conditionals, but that are invalid on the semantics provided. It is argued that the theory helps to explain how propositions that are ostensibly about counterfactual possible situations can be confirmed or disconfirmed by evidence about the actual world.","authors":["Robert C Stalnaker"],"meta":["January 1968","DOI:10.1093/oso/9780198810346.003.0010","In book: Studies in Logical Theory, American Philosophical Quarterly (pp.98-112)Publisher: Blackwell Publishers"],"references":[]}
