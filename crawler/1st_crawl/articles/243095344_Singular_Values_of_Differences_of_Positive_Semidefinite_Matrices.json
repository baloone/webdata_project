{"id":"243095344_Singular_Values_of_Differences_of_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices","abstract":"Let M-n be the space of n x n complex matrices. For A is an element of M-n, let s (A) = (s(1) (A),..., s(n)(A)), where s(1)(A) greater than or equal to ... greater than or equal to s(n)(A) are the singular values of A. We prove that if A, B is an element of M-n are positive semidefinite, then (i) s(j) (A - B) less than or equal to s(j) (A+B), j = 1, 2,..., n, and (ii) the weak log-majorization relations s (A-\\z\\B) <(wlog) s (A + zB) <(wlog) s (A + \\z\\B) hold for any complex number z. This sharpens some results due to R. Bhatia and F. Kittaneh.","authors":["Xingzhi Zhan"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1137/S0895479800369840"],"references":["225987772_Norm_Inequalities_for_Positive_Operators","266279152_Log-majorizations_and_norm_inequalities_for_exponential_operators","247047254_On_the_Singular_Values_of_a_Product_of_Operators","242986193_Inequalities_for_CS_seminorms_and_Lieb_functions","227169748_Norm_inequalities_related_to_operator_monotone_functions","225846343_Comparison_of_norms_f_A-f_B_and_f_A-B","220026774_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Linear_Non-Selfadjolt_Operators"]}
