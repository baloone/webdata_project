{"id":"338386725_Hankel_determinant_of_order_three_for_familiar_subsets_of_analytic_functions_related_with_sine_function","abstract":"In this paper we define and consider some familiar subsets of analytic functions associated with sine functions in the region of unit disk on the complex plane. For these classes our aim is to find the Hankel determinant of order three.","authors":["Muhammad Arif","Mohsan Raza","Huo Tang","Shehzad Hussain"],"meta":["December 2019Open Mathematics 17(1):1615-1630","DOI:10.1515/math-2019-0132"],"references":["331288825_Some_Subclasses_of_Uniformly_Univalent_Functions_with_Respect_to_Symmetric_Points","331090443_Starlike_Functions_Related_to_the_Bell_Numbers","328311264_Third-Order_Hankel_Determinant_for_Certain_Class_of_Analytic_Functions_Related_with_Exponential_Function","328271641_The_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions","326189147_The_Sharp_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions_of_Order_1_2","323187444_Radius_Problems_for_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_the_Sine_Function","312945036_On_Booth_lemniscate_and_starlike_functions","324231370_THE_SHARP_BOUND_FOR_THE_HANKEL_DETERMINANT_OF_THE_THIRD_KIND_FOR_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS","320458414_Second_Hankel_determinant_for_close-to-convex_functions","320075518_Some_coefficient_inequalities_related_to_the_Hankel_determinant_for_strongly_starlike_functions_of_order_alpha"]}
