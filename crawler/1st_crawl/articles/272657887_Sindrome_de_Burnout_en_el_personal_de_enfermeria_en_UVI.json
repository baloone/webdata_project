{"id":"272657887_Sindrome_de_Burnout_en_el_personal_de_enfermeria_en_UVI","abstract":"Introduction: The burnout syndrome occurs when a supportive relationship is maintained with a strong interpersonal relationship with the beneficiaries of that work. Several studies have considered the nursing staff as a fragile group. Some studies revealed that units that generate greater stress are those that meet critical or terminal patients: the environment, physical and emotional continuing demands to the nurses who are subjected by patients, and role ambiguity are characteristics that predispose the development of this syndrome. Objectives: The main objective is to determine the degree of burnout in the team ICU nursing Hospital Medical Ramon y Cajal. Material and methods: Sample of 68 nurses and assistants working in the ICU. As an instrument, we used Maslach Burnout Inventory in its Spanish version, self administered. Results: Low scores on the three dimensions of the syndrome (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment), and most sample with a 45.6%, tendency to suffer. Conclusions: Profile of workers suffering burnout is: nurse, 35 to 44 years, with contract fixed, experience over 16 years and an age of 1-5 years in that job.","authors":["Patricia Sánchez Alonso","Víctor Manuel Sierra Ortega"],"meta":["January 2014Enfermeria Global 13(1)","DOI:10.6018/eglobal.13.1.176811"],"references":[]}
