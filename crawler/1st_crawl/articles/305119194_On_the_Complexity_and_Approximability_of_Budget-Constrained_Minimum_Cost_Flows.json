{"id":"305119194_On_the_Complexity_and_Approximability_of_Budget-Constrained_Minimum_Cost_Flows","abstract":"We investigate the complexity and approximability of the budget-constrained minimum cost flow problem, which is an extension of the traditional minimum cost flow problem by a second kind of costs associated with each edge, whose total value in a feasible flow is constrained by a given budget B. This problem can, e.g., be seen as the application of the {\\epsilon}-constraint method to the bicriteria minimum cost flow problem. We show that we can solve the problem exactly in weakly polynomial time $O(\\log M \\cdot MCF(m,n,C,U))$, where C, U, and M are upper bounds on the largest absolute cost, largest capacity, and largest absolute value of any number occuring in the input, respectively, and MCF(m,n,C,U) denotes the complexity of finding a traditional minimum cost flow. Moreover, we present two fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the problem on general graphs and one with an improved running-time for the problem on acyclic graphs.","authors":["Michael Holzhauser","Sven O.
