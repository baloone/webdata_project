{"id":"327401043_Design_of_Linear_Time_Varying_Flatness-Based_Control_for_Single-Input_Single-Output_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, the control of linear discrete-time Varying Single-Input Single-Output systems is tackled. By using flatness theory combined with a dead-beat observer, a two degree of freedom controller is designed with high performances in terms of trajectory tracking. The aim of this work is to avoid the choice of closed loop poles in linear discrete-time varying framework which build a very serious problem in system control. The effectiveness of this control law is highlighted by simulation results.
