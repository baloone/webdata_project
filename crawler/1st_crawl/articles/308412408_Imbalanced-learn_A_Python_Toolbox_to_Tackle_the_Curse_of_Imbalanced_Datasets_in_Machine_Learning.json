{"id":"308412408_Imbalanced-learn_A_Python_Toolbox_to_Tackle_the_Curse_of_Imbalanced_Datasets_in_Machine_Learning","abstract":"Imbalanced-learn is an open-source python toolbox aiming at providing a wide range of methods to cope with the problem of imbalanced dataset frequently encountered in machine learning and pattern recognition. The implemented state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into 4 groups: (i) under-sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) combination of over- and under-sampling, and (iv) ensemble learning methods. The proposed toolbox only depends on numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn and is distributed under MIT license. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with scikit-learn and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported project. Documentation, unit tests as well as integration tests are provided to ease usage and contribution. The toolbox is publicly available in GitHub: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn.","authors":["Guillaume Lema√Ætre","Fernando Nogueira","Christos K.
