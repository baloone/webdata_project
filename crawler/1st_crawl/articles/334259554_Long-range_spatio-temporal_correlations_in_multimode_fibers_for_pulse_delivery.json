{"id":"334259554_Long-range_spatio-temporal_correlations_in_multimode_fibers_for_pulse_delivery","abstract":"Long-range correlations play an essential role in wave transport through disordered media, but have rarely been studied in other complex systems. Here we discover spatio-temporal intensity correlations for an optical pulse propagating through a multimode fiber with strong random mode coupling. Positive long-range correlation arises from multiple scattering in fiber mode space and depends on the statistical distribution of arrival times. By optimizing the incident wavefront of a pulse, we maximize the power transmitted at a selected time, and such control is significantly enhanced by the long-range spatio-temporal correlation. We provide an explicit relation between the correlation and the power enhancement, which agrees with experimental results. Our work shows that multimode fibers provide a fertile ground for studying complex wave phenomena. The strong spatio-temporal correlation can be employed for efficient power delivery at a well-defined time.","authors":["Wen Xiong","Chia Wei Hsu","Hui Cao"],"meta":["July 2019Nature Communications 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-10916-4"],"references":["329102709_Statistical_description_of_transport_in_multimode_fibers_with_mode-dependent_loss","319478083_Complete_Polarization_Control_in_Multimode_Fibers_with_Polarization_and_Mode_Coupling","318392714_Correlations_between_reflected_and_transmitted_intensity_patterns_emerging_from_opaque_disordered_media","316956321_Spatiotemporal_mode-locking_in_multimode_fiber_lasers","316235060_Super-_and_Anti-Principal_Modes_in_Multi-Mode_Waveguides","313690728_Correlation-enhanced_control_of_wave_focusing_in_disordered_media","309720572_Shaping_the_light_amplified_in_a_multimode_fiber","313845019_Light_fields_in_complex_media_Mesoscopic_scattering_meets_wave_control","307934986_Principal_modes_in_multimode_fibers_exploring_the_crossover_from_weak_to_strong_mode_coupling","307904265_Tailoring_Correlations_of_the_Local_Density_of_States_in_Disordered_Photonic_Materials"]}
