The proofs are taken from standard sources\n(books by Hankin and Barendregt), and cover: equational theory, reduction theory, residuals, finiteness of developments, and\nthe standardisation theorem. The issues in mechanising pen-and-paper proofs are discussed; in particular, those difficulties\narising from the sources’ use of the Barendregt Variable Convention.","authors":["Michael Norrish"],"meta":["September 2006Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation 19(2):169-195","DOI:10.1007/s10990-006-8745-7","SourceDBLP","Project: Mechanised Lambda-Calculus"],"references":["244440889_Residual_Theory_in_-calculus_A_Formal_Development","222646726_The_Mechanisation_of_Barendregt-Style_Equational_Proofs_the_Residual_Perspective","266430952_Lambda_calculi_A_guide_for_computer_scientists","250400155_Alpha-Structural_Recursion_and_Induction_Extended_Abstract","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","239229106_The_Primitive_Proof_Theory_of_the-Calculus","238719544_Theorem_Proving_in_Higher_Order_Logics_18th_International_Conference_TPHOLs_2005_Oxford_UK_August_22-25_2005_Proceedings","227020474_Nominal_techniques_in_IsabelleHOL","225454179_A_Formalised_First-Order_Con_uence_Proof_for_the_l-Calculus_Using_One-Sorted_Variable_Names_Barendregt_Was_Right_after_all_almost","225225200_Some_Lambda_Calculus_and_Type_Theory_Formalized"]}
