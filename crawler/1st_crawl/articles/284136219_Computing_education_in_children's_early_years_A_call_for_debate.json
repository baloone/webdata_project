{"id":"284136219_Computing_education_in_children's_early_years_A_call_for_debate","abstract":"International changes in policy and curricula (notably recent developments in England) have led to a focus on the role of computing education in the early years. As interest in the potential of computing education has increased, there has been a proliferation of programming tools designed for young children. While these changes are broadly to be welcomed, the pace of change has arguably led to more attention to the tools than to key questions about pedagogy. This paper proposes three areas of research (Logo; computational thinking; and teaching STEM subjects of science, technology , engineering and mathematics) that may inform computing education for young children and suggests that a greater focus on thinking skills and connections to manifestations of computers in the real world is needed. Above all, the paper calls for an informed debate about the trend towards introducing computing education to children in the early years. Introduction The trend towards computing education for children in the early years presents an exciting opportunity to tap into children's early potential for learning, especially if it takes place before some of the gender stereotypes associated with computing (Robertson, 2013; Wajcman, 2007) begin to influence their choices. Children in the UK start school at about the age of 5, and in this paper we refer to the 'early years' as the period immediately before and after this transition, including children between the ages of 3 and 6.","authors":["Andrew Manches","Lydia Plowman"],"meta":["December 2015British Journal of Educational Technology 48(1):n/a-n/a","DOI:10.1111/bjet.12355"],"references":["289963945_Conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge_of_mathematics_Does_one_lead_to_the_other","272655349_Algorithmics_for_Preschoolers-A_Contradiction","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","232539181_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_Young_Children's_Cognition","220420371_Computational_thinking","43462811_Electronic_blocks_Tangible_programming_elements_for_preschoolers","37596649_Using_Computer_Technology_to_Provide_a_Creative_Learning_Environment_for_Preschool_Children","32231248_Logo_Programming_and_Problem_Solving","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","343364402_Running_on_Empty_the_Failure_to_Teach_K--12_Computer_Science_in_the_Digital_Age","289962978_Conceptual_and_procedural_knowledge_of_mathematics_Does_one_lead_to_the_other","286873961_The_TangibleK_robotics_program_Applied_computational_thinking_for_young_children","286569240_Education_and_the_Family_Passing_Success_Across_the_Generations","285185066_The_art_and_craft_of_teaching","265092570_Building_and_Learning_With_Programmable_Bricks","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools","263330841_The_influence_of_a_game-making_project_on_male_and_female_learners'_attitudes_to_computing","262253499_Designing_ScratchJr_support_for_early_childhood_learning_through_computer_programming","259166238_Exploring_the_use_of_the_pedagogical_framework_for_creative_practice_in_preschool_settings_A_phenomenological_approach","257556889_The_Effect_of_a_Classroom-Based_Intensive_Robotics_and_Programming_Workshop_on_Sequencing_Ability_in_Early_Childhood","257171388_Problem_solving_by_5-6_years_old_kindergarten_children_in_a_computer_programming_environment_A_case_study","251353846_Tangibles_for_learning_A_representational_analysis_of_physical_manipulation","240605149_Editorial_Understanding_the_past-illuminating_the_future","239066366_A_Critique_of_Technocentrism_in_Thinking_About_the_School_of_the_Future","237063312_Shut_Down_or_Restart_The_Way_Forward_for_Computing_in_UK_Schools","226869830_Connecting_theory_and_practice_Results_from_the_teaching_of_Logo","45348020_From_women_and_technology_to_gendered_technoscience","43982079_Early_Childhood_Matters_Evidence_from_the_Effective_Pre-School_and_Primary_Education_Project","37533484_Logo_A_cause_for_concern","37244678_Children_play_and_computers_in_pre-school_education"]}
