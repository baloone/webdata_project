{"id":"327492569_Application_of_URREF_Criteria_to_Assess_Knowledge_Representation_in_Cyber_Threat_Models","abstract":"Abstractâ€”Systems for threat analysis enable users to understand\nthe nature and behavior of threats and to undertake a\ndeeper analysis for detailed exploration of threat profile and\nrisk estimation. Models for threat analysis require significant\nresources to be developed and are often relevant to limited\napplication tasks. This paper investigated the implicit and explicit\nuncertainty assessments to be taken into account for threat\nanalysis systems to be effective for providing a relevant threat\ncharacterization. The intent of this paper is twofold. The first\nis to present and discuss an approach to define a model for\ncyber threats within a simplified expert model and to translate\nit into a Bayesian network as a tool for the development of\npractical scenarios for cyber threats analysis. The second is to\naddress the question of assessing the Bayesian network build\nand its intrinsic knowledge representation model and to show\nhow modeling decisions impact the outcome of the system. The\npaper describes the construction of an expert model and the\ncorresponding BN to analyze cyber threats, investigates various\ntypes of induced uncertainty with the URREF criteria simplicity\nand expressiveness and implements an assessment procedure to\nevaluate the overall approach.","authors":["Valentina Dragos","Jurgen Ziegler","Johan Pieter De Villiers"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455832","Conference: 2018 International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","Project: Evaluation Techniques for Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning"],"references":["318788261_Evaluation_metrics_for_the_practical_application_of_URREF_ontology_An_illustration_on_data_criteria","312153418_A_framework_for_inferring_predictive_distributions_of_rhino_poaching_events_through_causal_modelling","307415327_A_Model-Based_Approach_for_Aviation_Cyber_Security_Risk_Assessment","305279024_Uncertainty_evaluation_of_data_and_information_fusion_within_the_context_of_the_decision_loop","282074100_Uncertainty_representation_quantification_and_evaluation_for_data_and_information_fusion","280223608_A_Critical_Assessment_of_Two_Methods_for_Heterogeneous_Information_Fusion","273440103_A_framework_for_inferring_predictive_distributions_of_rhino_poaching_events_through_causal_modelling","267227127_Automatic_Generation_of_Large_Causal_Bayesian_Networks_from_User_Oriented_Models","261316990_An_ontological_analysis_of_uncertainty_in_soft_data","261193628_Towards_unbiased_evaluation_of_uncertainty_reasoning_The_URREF_ontology","257207213_URREF_reliability_versus_credibility_in_information_fusion_STANAG_2511","251890108_Quantitative_Assessment_of_Cyber_Security_Risk_using_Bayesian_Network-based_model","220957917_Using_Bayesian_Networks_for_Cyber_Security_Analysis","220579567_Appraisal_of_companies_with_Bayesian_networks","4370057_User-oriented_Bayesian_identification_and_its_configuration","318788268_Subjects_under_evaluation_with_the_URREF_ontology","308864395_Security_situation_management_-_developing_a_concept_of_operations_and_threat_prediction_capability","308789965_URREF_Reliability_versus_Credibility_in_Information_Fusion_STANAG_2511","283082687_Dissecting_uncertainty-based_fusion_techniques_for_maritime_anomaly_detection","262735300_URREF_Self-Confidence_in_Information_Fusion_Trust","236944356_Risk_Assessment_and_Decision_Analysis_With_Bayesian_Networks","229891938_Terrorism_Risk_Management","222205204_Crimes_analysis_software_'Pins_in_Maps'_clustering_and_Bayes_net_prediction_Expert_Systems_with_Applications_254_569-588","216301244_Probabilistic_Reasoning_in_Intelligent_Systems_Networks_Of_Plausible_Inference"]}
