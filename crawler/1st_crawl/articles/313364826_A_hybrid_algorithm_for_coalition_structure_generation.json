{"id":"313364826_A_hybrid_algorithm_for_coalition_structure_generation","abstract":"The current state-of-the-art algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation is IDP-IPâ€”an algorithm that combines IDP (a dynamic programming algorithm due to Rahwan and Jennings, 2008b) with IP (a tree-search algorithm due to Rahwan et al., 2009). In this paper we analyse IDP-IP, highlight its limitations, and then develop a new approach for combining IDP with IP that overcomes these limitations.","authors":["Talal Rahwan","Tomasz Michalak","Nicholas R.
