{"id":"353982456_Mapping_K-12_Computer_Science_Teacher's_Interest_Self-Confidence_and_Knowledge_about_the_Use_of_Educational_Robotics_to_Teach","abstract":"This paper reports a case study, developed in K-12 Portuguese Education, that aimed to analyze the computer science teachers’ knowledge, interest, and self-confidence to use educational robotics and other programable objects in classroom activities to teach computer science concepts and to promote students’ computational thinking skills. The research design was organized into a descriptive and exploratory quantitative approach. The participants were 174 in-service computer science teachers of Portuguese public education. The data was gathered from the participants, through the online application of the Robotics Interest Questionnaire scale (RIQ). Very positive levels of teacher’s knowledge, interest, and self-efficacy to use educational robotics for teaching purposes were reported in the study outcomes. These constructs were underlined in several studies as relevant factors to promote the use of educational robotics and other similar technologies by the teachers. Despite the study limitations and the small context, a set of relevant results was highlighted on computer science in-service teachers’ interest and preparation to use robotics and to support their students in learning activities with these artifacts.","authors":["Nuno Dorotea","João Piedade","Ana Pedro"],"meta":["August 2021Education Sciences 11(8):443","DOI:10.3390/educsci11080443","Project: Computer Science Teacher Education"],"references":["351107401_Attitudes_towards_the_Use_of_Educational_Robotics_Exploring_Pre-Service_and_In-Service_Early_Childhood_Teacher_Profiles","349855873_Supporting_Teachers_on_Their_STEAM_Journey_A_Collaborative_STEAM_Teacher_Training_Program","349108706_Teacher_Perspectives_on_Teaching_the_STEM_Approach_to_Educational_Coding_and_Robotics_in_Primary_Education","344380045_Pre-service_and_in-service_teachers'_interest_knowledge_and_self-_confidence_in_using_educational_robotics_in_learning_activities","343761152_On_Teaching_Programming_Fundamentals_and_Computational_Thinking_with_Educational_Robotics_A_Didactic_Experience_with_Pre-Service_Teachers","340206364_Preservice_Preschool_Teachers'_Self-efficacy_in_and_Need_for_STEM_Education_Professional_Development_STEM_Pedagogical_Belief_as_a_Mediator","332816054_As_tecnologias_de_informacao_e_comunicacao_na_formacao_inicial_de_professores_do_1_ciclo_do_ensino_basico_-_fatores_constrangedores_invocados_pelos_formadores_para_o_uso_das_tecnologias","343663010_Measuring_teacher_beliefs_about_coding_and_computational_thinking","335707188_Effects_of_robotics_programming_on_the_computational_thinking_and_creativity_of_elementary_school_students","334113768_Using_robot-based_practices_to_develop_an_activity_that_incorporated_the_6E_model_to_improve_elementary_school_students'_learning_performances"]}
