{"id":"303830001_On_Alternate_Relaying_With_Improper_Gaussian_Signaling","abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the potential benefits of adopting improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) in a two-hop alternate relaying (AR) system. Given the known benefits of using IGS in interference-limited networks, we propose to use IGS to relieve the inter-relay interference (IRI) impact on the AR system assuming no channel state information is available at the source. In this regard, we assume that the two relays use IGS and the source uses proper Gaussian signaling (PGS). Then, we optimize the degree of impropriety of the relays signal, measured by the circularity coefficient, to maximize the total achievable rate. Simulation results show that using IGS yields a significant performance improvement over PGS, especially when the first hop is a bottleneck due to weak source-relay channel gains and/or strong IRI.","authors":["Mohamed Gaafar","Osama Amin","Aissa Ikhlef","Anas Chaaban"],"meta":["August 2016IEEE Communications Letters 20(8):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2577029"],"references":["265908649_Benefits_of_Improper_Signaling_for_Underlay_Cognitive_Radio","258247343_In-Band_Full-Duplex_Wireless_Challenges_and_Opportunities","229438063_Transmit_Optimization_With_Improper_Gaussian_Signaling_for_Interference_Channels","224599537_Catching_resource-devouring_worms_in_next-generation_wireless_relay_systems_Two-way_relay_and_full-duplex_relay","224168142_Interference_Alignment_With_Asymmetric_Complex_Signaling-Settling_the_Host-Madsen-Nosratinia_Conjecture","220127507_AF_Two-Path_Half_Duplex_Relaying_with_Inter-Relay_Self_Interference_Cancellation_Diversity_Analysis_and_its_Improvement","3434301_Recovering_Multiplexing_Loss_Through_Successive_Relaying_Using_Repetition_Coding","3236495_Spectral_Efficient_Protocols_for_Half-Duplex_Fading_Relay_Channels","308814825_Lattice-based_cooperative_communications_for_two-path_relay_channels_with_direct_link","308807440_Spectrum_sharing_opportunities_of_full-duplex_systems_using_improper_Gaussian_signaling","282844358_Spectrum_Sharing_Opportunities_of_Full-Duplex_Systems_using_Improper_Gaussian_Signaling","220087650_On_Achievable_Rates_of_Two-Path_Successive_Relaying","3078254_Proper_Complex_Random_Processes_with_Applications_to_Information_Theory"]}
