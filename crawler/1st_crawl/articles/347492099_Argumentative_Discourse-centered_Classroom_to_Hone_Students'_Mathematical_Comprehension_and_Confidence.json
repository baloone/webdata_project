{"id":"347492099_Argumentative_Discourse-centered_Classroom_to_Hone_Students'_Mathematical_Comprehension_and_Confidence","abstract":"The study determined the effect of argumentative discourse-centered classroom on the participants' mathematical comprehension and self-confidence. It used a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental control group design. The experimental group was exposed to Argumentative Discourse-centered Classroom model while the control group was exposed to DepEd 4A's model. Two research instruments were used: concept mapping to assess mathematics comprehension and confidence self-test. The data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, and ANCOVA Equal n's. The analysis revealed that the scores of those who were exposed to Argumentative Discourse-centered Classroom model are comparable to those exposed to DepEd 4A's model in terms of mathematical comprehension and confidence. The researchers recommend that mathematics teachers may use Argumentative Discourse-centered Classroom model not only in Mathematics but also in other Mathematics related subjects to enable students experience how to express their own ideas with their classmates to exhibit their conceptual understanding and enhance oral communication skills.","authors":["Mae Antonette Ticar","Charita Luna","Rosie Tan"],"meta":["May 2020American Journal of Educational Research 8(5):304-308","DOI:10.12691/education-8-5-13"],"references":["276358105_Arguing_collaboratively_Argumentative_discourse_types_and_their_potential_for_knowledge_building","336075624_Mathematics_Anxiety_Factors_and_Their_Influence_on_Performance_in_Mathematics_in_Selected_International_Schools_in_Bangkok","311482177_The_silent_and_the_vocal_Participation_and_learning_in_whole-class_discussion"]}
