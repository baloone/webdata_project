{"id":"283032149_Wireless_ZigBee_home_automation_system","abstract":"The home automation system concept existed for many years but in the last decade, due to the rapid development of sensors and wireless technologies, a large number of various such \"intelligent homes\" have been developed. The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the flexibility, reliability and affordability of home automation projects, based on a simple and affordable implementation. A wireless sensing and control system have been developed and tested, having a number of basic functionalities such as switching on/off the light according to ambient lighting and turning on/off the central heating. The system has been built around low power microcontrollers and ZigBee modems for wireless communication, using a set of Vishay 640 thermistor sensors for temperature measurements and Vishay LDR07 photo-resistor for humidity measurements. A trigger is activated when the temperature or light measurements are above/below a given threshold and a command is transmitted to the central unit through the ZigBee radio module. All the data processing is performed by a low power microcontroller both at the sensing device and at the control unit.","authors":["Razvan Craciunescu","Simona Halunga","Octavian Fratu"],"meta":["February 2015Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering 9258","DOI:10.1117/12.2072262"],"references":["224567738_A_ZigBee-Based_Home_Automation_System","286044209_Wireless_Sensor_and_Actuator_Networks","254056610_Centralised_Smart_Home_Control_System_via_XBee_transceivers","224154272_Enhanced_Self-Configuration_Scheme_for_a_Robust_ZigBee-based_Home_Automation"]}
