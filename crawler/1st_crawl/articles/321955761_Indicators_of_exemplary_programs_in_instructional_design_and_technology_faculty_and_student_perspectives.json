{"id":"321955761_Indicators_of_exemplary_programs_in_instructional_design_and_technology_faculty_and_student_perspectives","abstract":"This exploratory study investigated what faculty and current students in Instructional Design and Technology (IDT) programs perceive as indicators of an exemplary program. We surveyed a sample of the faculty and students and asked them to identify the most important indicators of an exemplary program and rank their own programs according to those indicators. We contacted programs from 11 different countries, though the majority of contacted programs were from the United States of America. We coded and analyzed the respondentsâ€™ 941 indicator statements and created 35 thematic indicators. The frequency and percentage of occurrence of these themes across the programs for both faculty and students were analyzed. Their mean rating of their programs for each theme was also calculated. The paper presents the results of this analysis and examines the differences across students/faculty and program types. The findings of this survey, albeit limited due to the low response rate, could benefit IDT programs in terms of performance improvement and assist students by offering criteria by which they can select a graduate program.","authors":["Thomas Logan Arrington","Aubteen Darabi"],"meta":["December 2017Educational Technology Research and Development 66(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11423-017-9561-y"],"references":["236777446_What_Matters_for_Excellence_in_PhD_Programs_Latent_Constructs_of_Doctoral_Program_Quality_Used_by_Early_Career_Social_Scientists","225741576_Are_You_Satisfied_PhD_Education_and_Faculty_Taste_for_Prestige_Limits_of_the_Prestige_Value_System","224029397_A_General_Inductive_Approach_for_Analyzing_Qualitative_Evaluation_Data","319030110_What_Matters_for_Excellence_in_PhD_Programs_Latent_Constructs_of_Doctoral_Program_Quality_Used_by_Early_Career_Social_Scientists","283954668_Live_and_Learn_Informal_Learning_Among_Future_Professionals","274669455_Counting_Chickens_Before_They_Are_Hatched_An_Examination_of_Student_Retention_Graduation_Attrition_and_Dropout_Measurement_Validity_in_an_Online_Master's_Environment","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","258160358_Teacher_Value_Added_as_a_Measure_of_Program_Quality_Interpret_With_Caution","248115140_Instructional_design_career_environments_Survey_of_the_alignment_of_preparation_and_practice","248114166_Twenty_years_of_productivity_in_ETRD_by_institutions_and_authors","247718451_Graduate_Education_of_the_Top_Contributors_to_the_School_Psychology_Literature_1987-1995","229726059_Human_Competence_Engineering_Worthy_Performance","229491824_Increasing_student_retention_in_graduate_and_professional_programs","227414398_Is_it_where_you_go_or_who_you_know_On_the_relationship_between_students_PhD_program_quality_dissertation_advisor_prominence_and_early_career_publishing_success","227373883_Selection_Bias_in_Web_Surveys","221862169_Educational_Factors_Outweigh_the_Importance_of_Lifestyle_Factors_for_Residency_Program_Applicants_An_International_Comparative_Study","47410113_The_National_Research_Council_Graduate_Program_Ratings_What_Are_They_Measuring","11751983_Americas_Best_Medical_Schools_A_Critique_of_the_US_News_World_Report_Rankings","11570807_Two_Perspectives_on_the_Indicators_of_Quality_in_Psychiatry_Residencies"]}
