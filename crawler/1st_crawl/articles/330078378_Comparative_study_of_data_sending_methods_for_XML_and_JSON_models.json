{"id":"330078378_Comparative_study_of_data_sending_methods_for_XML_and_JSON_models","abstract":"Data exchange between different devices and applications has become a necessity nowadays. Data is no longer stored locally on the device, but in the cloud. In order to communicate with the cloud and exchange data, web services are being used. To keep the communication consistent across different devices and platforms, the data needs to be formatted using a standard data format, such as JSON or XML. This paper compares both standards and provides an in depth analysis of their performance. In order to perform the analysis a web API was built in the PHP framework Laravel, which was then tested with the help of the API development environment called Postman for different number of transferred items. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","authors":["Anca-Raluca Breje","Robert Gyorodi","Cornelia Győrödi","Doina Zmaranda"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(12)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.091229"],"references":["329707959_Comparison_of_JSON_and_XML_Data_Formats","311750440_Comparative_analysis_of_AMF_JSON_and_XML_technologies_for_data_transfer_between_the_server_and_the_client","265874991_Using_JSON_for_Data_Exchanging_in_Web_Service_Applications","316849641_JSON_Data_model_Query_languages_and_Schema_specification","265816300_HTTP_The_definitive_guide","220922905_Comparison_of_JSON_and_XML_data_interchange_formats_A_case_study"]}
