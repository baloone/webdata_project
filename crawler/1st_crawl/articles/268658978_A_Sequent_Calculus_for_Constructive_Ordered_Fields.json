{"id":"268658978_A_Sequent_Calculus_for_Constructive_Ordered_Fields","abstract":"The theory of constructive ordered fields, based on a relation of strict linear order, is formalized as a proof-theoretical system, a sequent calculus extended with nonlogical rules. It is proved that structural rules, the rules of cut and contraction in particular, can be eliminated from derivations. The method of extension by nonlogical rules is applied also to the theory of real closed fields, starting from a quantifier-free axiomatization.","authors":["Sara Negri"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/978-94-015-9757-9_13"],"references":["267164992_Kreisel's_unwinding_of_Artin's_proof","243698945_Mathematical_intuitionism_-_Introduction_to_proof_theory","220690164_Structural_Proof_Theory","220592606_Sequent_Calculus_Proof_Theory_of_Intuitionistic_Apartness_and_Order_Relations","220592224_The_continuum_as_a_formal_space","220150923_Constructive_Mathematics_A_Foundation_for_Computable_Analysis","38373131_Cut_Elimination_in_the_Presence_of_Axioms","31677950_Foundations_of_mathematical_analysis_JK_Truss"]}
