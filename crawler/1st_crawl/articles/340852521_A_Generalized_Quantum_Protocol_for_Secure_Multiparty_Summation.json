{"id":"340852521_A_Generalized_Quantum_Protocol_for_Secure_Multiparty_Summation","abstract":"The secure multiparty quantum summation is an important primitive of quantum cryptography. The existing multiparty quantum summation protocols have \n$(n, n)$ \nthreshold approach, where \n$n$ \nout of total \n$n$ \nplayers need compute the summation protocol. In this brief, we present a generalized secure multiparty quantum summation protocol. In our protocol, the linear secret sharing (LSS) and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) are used to take the advantages of both classical and quantum summation. We show that the outside and participant attacks are not possible in our protocol. We simulate it using the real quantum processor released by IBM corporation on “cloud”.","authors":["Kartick Sutradhar","Hari Om"],"meta":["April 2020Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, IEEE Transactions on PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCSII.2020.2989447"],"references":["333906188_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication_with_Mutually_Unbiased_Bases","324658413_Secure_multi-party_quantum_summation_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","318755023_Quantum_solution_to_a_class_of_two-party_private_summation_problems","317934887_An_Novel_Protocol_for_the_Quantum_Secure_Multi-Party_Summation_Based_on_Two-Particle_Bell_States","291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","236447392_Efficient_multiparty_quantum-secret-sharing_schemes","313321156_Multi-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party_based_on_single_particles","294723100_Efficient_Sorting_Architecture_for_Successive-Cancellation-List_Decoding_of_Polar_Codes","293178577_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","282990572_Efficient_implementation_of_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_using_vote_count_circuit","276455918_Three-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party","260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","259228663_Quantum_entanglement_for_secret_sharing_and_secret_splitting","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","225809116_An_Efficient_Protocol_for_the_Secure_Multi-party_Quantum_Summation","222575138_Multiparty_quantum_secret_sharing_with_pure_entangled_states_and_decoy_photons","3451170_Quantum_switching_and_quantum_merge_sorting"]}
