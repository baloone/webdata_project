{"id":"280912053_Deterministic_Algorithms_for_Submodular_Maximization_Problems","abstract":"Randomization is a fundamental tool used in many theoretical and practical\nareas of computer science. We study here the role of randomization in the area\nof submodular function maximization. In this area most algorithms are\nrandomized, and in almost all cases the approximation ratios obtained by\ncurrent randomized algorithms are superior to the best results obtained by\nknown deterministic algorithms. Derandomization of algorithms for general\nsubmodular function maximization seems hard since the access to the function is\ndone via a value oracle. This makes it hard, for example, to apply standard\nderandomization techniques such as conditional expectations. Therefore, an\ninteresting fundamental problem in this area is whether randomization is\ninherently necessary for obtaining good approximation ratios.\nIn this work we give evidence that randomization is not necessary for\nobtaining good algorithms by presenting a new technique for derandomization of\nalgorithms for submodular function maximization. Our high level idea is to\nmaintain explicitly a (small) distribution over the states of the algorithm,\nand carefully update it using marginal values obtained from an extreme point\nsolution of a suitable linear formulation. We demonstrate our technique on two\nrecent algorithms for unconstrained submodular maximization and for maximizing\nsubmodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. In particular, for\nunconstrained submodular maximization we obtain an optimal deterministic\n$1/2$-approximation showing that randomization is unnecessary for obtaining\noptimal results for this setting.","authors":["Niv Buchbinder","Moran Feldman"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch29","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265480108_Monotone_Submodular_Maximization_over_a_Matroid_via_Non-Oblivious_Local_Search","259212146_Bounds_on_Double-Sided_Myopic_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Non-monotone_Submodular_Maximization","242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","228720638_Gadgets_Approximation_and_Linear_Programming","227444614_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","225662604_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Maximization_via_a_Structural_Continuous_Greedy_Algorithm","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220770367_Submodular_Max-SAT","220138499_Optimal_inapproximability_results_for_MAX-CUT_and_other_2-variable_CSPs","314053102_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","284504706_Submodular_Maximization_with_Cardinality_Constraints","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","275669643_Streaming_Algorithms_for_Submodular_Function_Maximization","271387865_Online_Submodular_Maximization_with_Preemption","266477774_Comparing_Apples_and_Oranges_Query_Tradeoff_in_Submodular_Maximization","265490239_Approximations_for_Monotone_and_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Maximization_with_Knapsack_Constraints","265365884_On_the_Uncapacitated_Location_Problem","261211772_A_Tight_Linear_Time_12-Approximation_For_Unconstrained_Submodular_Maximization","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","224678314_Approximation_algorithms_for_allocation_problems_Improving_the_factor_of_1_-_1e","222306805_An_0828-approximation_algorithm_for_the_uncapacitated_facility_location_problem","221669789_Probability_and_Computing_Randomized_Algorithms_and_Probabilistic_Analysis","221498436_A_Unified_Continuous_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Submodular_Maximization","220779820_Combinatorial_approximation_algorithms_for_the_maximum_directed_cut_problem","220779129_Tight_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_General_Assignment_Problems","220778896_An_improved_approximation_algorithm_for_combinatorial_auctions_with_submodular_bidders","220618371_Maximizing_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Functions","220617718_A_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Multiple_Knapsack_Problem","220617298_Maximizing_a_Monotone_Submodular_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint","220533377_Maximizing_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Functions_under_Matroid_or_Knapsack_Constraints","220112983_An_efficient_approximation_for_the_Generalized_Assignment_Problem","51947040_Symmetry_and_Approximability_of_Submodular_Maximization_Problems","45928450_Submodular_Maximization_by_Simulated_Annealing","2493479_Some_optimal_inapproximability_results","2457699_0878_approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_CUT_and_MAX_2-SAT_Proc_26th_ACM_Symp_Theory_Comput1994_422-431_Updated_as_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_cut_and_satisfiability_problems_using_semi","2237681_Approximating_the_value_of_two_prover_proof_systems_with_applications_to_MAX_2SAT_and_MAX_DICUT"]}
