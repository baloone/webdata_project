{"id":"326667031_Approches_multiagents_pour_l'allocation_de_courses_a_une_flotte_de_taxis_autonomes","abstract":"This work is interested in decentrally solving a taxi allocation problem over a fleet of autonomous taxis. Classically, to solve this problem, requests are centralized into a portal where a dispatcher allocates requests to taxis (ideally, in an optimal manner). This requires taxis have continuous access to the portal. However, getting access to such global communication infrastructureis very expensive for taxi companies. The idea here is to use new affordable vehicle-to-vehicle communication technologies to coordinate taxis without global communication infrastructure. Our approach is presented and empirically evaluated via simulations. We have developed different scenarios with different communication infrastructure and coordination mechanisms, and we analyze, their resulting quality of service, user welfare, gain and robustness to message loss.","authors":["Gauthier Picard","Olivier Boissier","Flavien Balbo"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.3166/RIA.32.223-247"],"references":[]}
