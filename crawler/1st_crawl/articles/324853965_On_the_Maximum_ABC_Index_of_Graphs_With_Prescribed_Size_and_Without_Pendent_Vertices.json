{"id":"324853965_On_the_Maximum_ABC_Index_of_Graphs_With_Prescribed_Size_and_Without_Pendent_Vertices","abstract":"The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index is one of the most actively studied degree-based graph invariants, which are found in a vast variety of chemical applications. For a simple graph G, it is defined as ABC(G) = ∑uvE(G)√d(u)+d(v)−2/(u)d(v), where d(v) denotes the degree of a vertex v of G. Recently in [17] graphs with n vertices, 2n – 4 and 2n – 3 edges, and maximum ABC idex were characterized. Here, we consider the next, more complex case, and characterize the graphs with n vertices, 2n-2 edges and maximum ABC index.","authors":["Zehui Shao","Pu Wu","Xiujun Zhang","Darko Dimitrov"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2831910"],"references":["308980649_Remarks_on_the_maximum_atom-bond_connectivity_index_of_graphs_with_given_parameters","283159084_On_atom-bond_connectivity_index_and_its_chemical_applicability","282601977_Fast_Computer_Search_for_Trees_with_Minimal_ABC_Index_Based_on_Tree_Degree_Sequences","279279040_On_the_atom-bond_connectivity_index_and_radius_of_connected_graphs","319618119_Efficient_computation_of_trees_with_minimal_atom-bond_connectivity_index_revisited","319617811_On_structural_properties_of_trees_with_minimal_atom-bond_connectivity_index_IV_Solving_a_conjecture_about_the_pendent_paths_of_length_three","319123037_On_the_maximum_ABC_index_of_graphs_without_pendent_vertices","297177034_On_structural_properties_of_trees_with_minimal_atom-bond_connectivity_index_III_Trees_with_pendent_paths_of_length_three","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","268618397_Extreme_Atom-Bond_Connectivity_Index_of_Graphs"]}
