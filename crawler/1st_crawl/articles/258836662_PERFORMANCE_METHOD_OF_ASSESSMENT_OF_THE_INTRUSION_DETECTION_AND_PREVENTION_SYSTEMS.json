{"id":"258836662_PERFORMANCE_METHOD_OF_ASSESSMENT_OF_THE_INTRUSION_DETECTION_AND_PREVENTION_SYSTEMS","abstract":"The intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems (IDS / IPS) are the latest tools of the security of the computerised data of a company although the evaluation of their performance and efficiency is important. In [13], we tried to assess the performance of these tools with regard to the analysis methods, reliability, etc; in [14], with regard to the objectives of the computer security; and in [15], we evaluated the performance of the IDS and IPS on the basis of the artificial neural network. This article is organized as follows: section 2 presents the assessment of the analysis method, reliability, responsiveness, easiness of implementation and adaptability, etc; section 3 presents the performance assessment in relation to the objectives of the computer security embodied in integrity, confidentiality, authenticity and availability; section 4 presents an IDS and IPS performance evaluation based on the artificial neural network. The article closes up with a conclusion.","authors":["Yousef Farhaoui","Equipe Sccam","Asimi Ahmed"],"meta":["January 2012","Project: The design of an online learning system in Morocco (especially rural areas)"],"references":["221609849_Defining_categories_to_select_representative_attack_test-cases","248594299_Detecting_wireless_LAN_MAC_address_spoof_-_ing","221427433_Sequence_Number_Based_MAC_Address_Spoof_Detection","221056921_Intrusion_Detection_Introduction_to_Intrusion_Detection_and_Security_Information_Management","220545032_Revised_taxonomy_for_intrusion-detection_systems","2414434_Weakness_in_the_Key_Scheduling_Algorithm_of_RC4"]}
