{"id":"230698422_Next-Generation_Digital_Information_Storage_in_DNA","abstract":"Digital information is accumulating at an astounding rate, straining our ability to store and archive it. DNA is among the most dense and stable information media known. The development of new technologies in both DNA synthesis and sequencing make DNA an increasingly feasible digital storage medium. We developed a strategy to encode arbitrary digital information in DNA, wrote a 5.27-megabit book using DNA microchips, and read the book by using next-generation DNA sequencing.","authors":["George Church","Yuan Gao","Sriram Kosuri"],"meta":["August 2012Science 337(6102):1628","DOI:10.1126/science.1226355","SourcePubMed"],"references":["312412866_Cell_volume_increase_in_Escherichia_coli_after_shifts_to_richer_media","275410466_The_Sequence_AlignmentMap_format_and_SAMtools","274102559_Long-Term_Storage_of_Information_in_DNA","273970167_Microvenus","258722535_Search_for_Pore-fection","244489845_Eigler_D_M_Schweizer_E_K_Positioning_single_atoms_with_a_scanning_tunneling_microscope_Nature_344_524-526","244365357_Synthetic_Biology_Tinkering_Biology_and_Artificial_Biology_What_are_We_Learning","236652467_When_It_Rains_It_Pores","232801100_For_anyone_who_ever_said_there's_no_such_thing_as_a_poetic_gene","224897497_Genome_sequencing_Search_for_pore-fection"]}
