{"id":"239524502_The_hard-core_model_on_random_graphs_revisited","abstract":"We revisit the classical hard-core model, also known as independent set and\ndual to vertex cover problem, where one puts particles with a first-neighbor\nhard-core repulsion on the vertices of a random graph. Although the case of\nrandom graphs with small and very large average degrees respectively are quite\nwell understood, they yield qualitatively different results and our aim here is\nto reconciliate these two cases. We revisit results that can be obtained using\nthe (heuristic) cavity method and show that it provides a closed-form\nconjecture for the exact density of the densest packing on random regular\ngraphs with degree K>=20, and that for K>16 the nature of the phase transition\nis the same as for large K. This also shows that the hard-code model is the\nsimplest mean-field lattice model for structural glasses and jamming.","authors":["Jean Barbier","Florent Krzakala","Lenka Zdeborov√°","Pan Zhang"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of Physics Conference Series 473(1)","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/473/1/012021","SourcearXiv"],"references":["231100266_Potts_Glass_on_Random_Graphs","225491592_Glass_models_on_Bethe_lattices","258873733_On_coloring_random_graphs","243006654_Limit_theorem_for_decomposable_multi-dimensional_Galton_Watson_processes","241533306_Phase_Transitions_in_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems_Basics_Algorithms_and_Statistical_Mechanics","235929805_Information_Physics_and_Computation","231964851_Cliques_in_random_graphs","226622102_Single_Machine_Precedence_Constrained_Scheduling_Is_a_Vertex_Cover_Problem","225168222_Hard_Constrained_Vertex-Cover_Communication_Algorithm_for_WSN","222645992_Statistical_mechanics_perspective_on_the_phase_transition_in_vertex_covering_of_finite-connectivity_random_graphs"]}
