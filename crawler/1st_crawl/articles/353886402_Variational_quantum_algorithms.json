{"id":"353886402_Variational_quantum_algorithms","abstract":"Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.","authors":["Marco Cerezo","Andrew Arrasmith","Ryan Babbush","Simon Charles Benjamin"],"meta":["August 2021","DOI:10.1038/s42254-021-00348-9"],"references":["355600410_Entanglement-Induced_Barren_Plateaus","355346257_Absence_of_Barren_Plateaus_in_Quantum_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","354625517_Exponential_Error_Suppression_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Devices","353812255_Measurement_Cost_of_Metric-Aware_Variational_Quantum_Algorithms","353529329_Unified_approach_to_data-driven_quantum_error_mitigation","352718881_The_power_of_quantum_neural_networks","352267385_Correlation-Informed_Permutation_of_Qubits_for_Reducing_Ansatz_Depth_in_the_Variational_Quantum_Eigensolver","351843382_Multi-exponential_error_extrapolation_and_combining_error_mitigation_techniques_for_NISQ_applications","351842418_Parallel_quantum_simulation_of_large_systems_on_small_NISQ_computers","351651802_Solving_nonlinear_differential_equations_with_differentiable_quantum_circuits","351332719_Error_mitigation_on_a_near-term_quantum_photonic_device","351321141_Quantum-optimal-control-inspired_ansatz_for_variational_quantum_algorithms","351170200_Qubit-ADAPT-VQE_An_Adaptive_Algorithm_for_Constructing_Hardware-Efficient_Ansatze_on_a_Quantum_Processor","350206836_Minimizing_Estimation_Runtime_on_Noisy_Quantum_Computers","350192046_Cost_function_dependent_barren_plateaus_in_shallow_parametrized_quantum_circuits","349988902_Universal_variational_quantum_computation","349936559_Mitigating_Realistic_Noise_in_Practical_Noisy_Intermediate-Scale_Quantum_Devices","349068263_Efficient_and_noise_resilient_measurements_for_quantum_chemistry_on_near-term_quantum_computers","348758575_Layerwise_learning_for_quantum_neural_networks","348643716_Efficient_quantum_measurement_of_Pauli_operators_in_the_presence_of_finite_sampling_error","347461467_Exploring_Entanglement_and_Optimization_within_the_Hamiltonian_Variational_Ansatz","347278134_Variational_quantum_algorithm_for_nonequilibrium_steady_states","346515701_Sequential_minimal_optimization_for_quantum-classical_hybrid_algorithms","346089844_Iterative_qubit-excitation_based_variational_quantum_eigensolver","345208443_Variational_fast_forwarding_for_quantum_simulation_beyond_the_coherence_time","345088937_Orbital_optimized_unitary_coupled_cluster_theory_for_quantum_computer","344005111_Stochastic_gradient_descent_for_hybrid_quantum-classical_optimization","343831767_On_the_universality_of_the_quantum_approximate_optimization_algorithm","356008925_Iterative_quantum-assisted_eigensolver","352766156_Variational_algorithms_for_linear_algebra","351803716_On_barren_plateaus_and_cost_function_locality_in_variational_quantum_algorithms","351536478_Barren_Plateaus_Preclude_Learning_Scramblers","351385726_Noise-Assisted_Quantum_Autoencoder","350987000_Expressibility_of_the_alternating_layered_ansatz_for_quantum_computation","350775292_Mitigating_measurement_errors_in_multiqubit_experiments","350713174_Low-Depth_Gradient_Measurements_Can_Improve_Convergence_in_Variational_Hybrid_Quantum-Classical_Algorithms","350704041_Higher_order_derivatives_of_quantum_neural_networks_with_barren_plateaus","350507327_Natural_Evolutionary_Strategies_for_Variational_Quantum_Computation","350397588_Effects_of_Quantum_Noise_on_Quantum_Approximate_Optimization_Algorithm","350359303_Effect_of_data_encoding_on_the_expressive_power_of_variational_quantum-machine-learning_models","350335643_Variational_Circuit_Compiler_for_Quantum_Error_Correction","350085405_Abrupt_transitions_in_variational_quantum_circuit_training","350072826_Hybrid_Quantum-Classical_Algorithms_and_Quantum_Error_Mitigation","348514868_Characterizing_the_loss_landscape_of_variational_quantum_circuits","348433727_Estimating_the_gradient_and_higher-order_derivatives_on_quantum_hardware","348261025_Large_gradients_via_correlation_in_random_parameterized_quantum_circuits","347839108_Strategies_for_solving_the_Fermi-Hubbard_model_on_near-term_quantum_computers","347338302_Variational_Quantum_Generators_Generative_Adversarial_Quantum_Machine_Learning_for_Continuous_Distributions","346984806_Noise-resilient_variational_hybrid_quantum-classical_optimization","346172124_Yaojl_Extensible_Efficient_Framework_for_Quantum_Algorithm_Design","343751565_Characterizing_local_noise_in_QAOA_circuits","343142092_Expressive_power_of_parametrized_quantum_circuits","343122480_Resource_Estimation_for_Quantum_Variational_Simulations_of_the_Hubbard_Model","342769578_The_Born_supremacy_quantum_advantage_and_training_of_an_Ising_Born_machine","343503981_Variational_quantum_eigensolver_for_frustrated_quantum_systems"]}
