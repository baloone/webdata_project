{"id":"224169975_A_Virtual_Reality_Dance_Training_System_Using_Motion_Capture_Technology","abstract":"In this paper, a new dance training system based on the motion capture and virtual reality (VR) technologies is proposed. Our system is inspired by the traditional way to learn new movements-imitating the teacher's movements and listening to the teacher's feedback. A prototype of our proposed system is implemented, in which a student can imitate the motion demonstrated by a virtual teacher projected on the wall screen. Meanwhile, the student's motions will be captured and analyzed by the system based on which feedback is given back to them. The result of user studies showed that our system can successfully guide students to improve their skills. The subjects agreed that the system is interesting and can motivate them to learn.","authors":["Jacky C. P. Chan","Howard Leung","Jeff K. T.
