{"id":"286148325_Overview_of_the_6th_international_competition_on_plagiarism_detection","abstract":"This paper overviews 17 plagiarism detectors that have been evaluated within the sixth international competition on plagiarism detection at PAN 2014. We report on their performances for the two tasks source retrieval and text alignment of external plagiarism detection. For the third year in a row, we invite software submissions instead of run submissions for this task, which allows for cross-year evaluations. Moreover, we introduce new performance measures for text alignment to shed light on new aspects of detection performance.","authors":["Martin Potthast","M. Hagen","A. Beyer","M.
