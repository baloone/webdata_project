{"id":"242862861_Astronomically-oriented_markings_on_Stonehenge","abstract":"In view of the years of careful study that have been devoted to\nStonehenge it may seem unlikely that any more information could be\nextracted from the monument, or at least from that part of it above\nground. During the past two years, however, further markings have come\nto light that are, at least, interesting, and possibly important. These\nmarkings are a series of at least 11 pits on the upper surfaces of the\nthree contiguous lintels (130, 101 and 102) that span the well-known\nline of sight from the centre of the sarsen circle north-eastward\ntowards the heel stone. For an observer diametrically across the circle,\n9 of these pits identify directions of the rising moon at significant\npoints in its 18.6-yr cycle.","authors":["Richard F.
