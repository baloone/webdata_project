{"id":"227075311_Rediscovering_Froebel_A_Call_to_Re-examine_his_Life_Gifts","abstract":"This article examines the life of Friedrich Froebel, the founder of the kindergarten movement and his first 10 “gifts to children.” The author suggests that Froebel’s philosophy of German Romanticism caused the waning use of his methods. He continues to state that Froebel’s development of instructional material and structured play-based curricula is worth re-examining during this time for greater accountability and expectation for the early academic success of children.","authors":["John P.
