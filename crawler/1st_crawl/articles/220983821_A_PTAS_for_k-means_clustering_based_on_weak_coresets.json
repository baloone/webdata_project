{"id":"220983821_A_PTAS_for_k-means_clustering_based_on_weak_coresets","abstract":"Given a point set P Rd the k-means clustering problem is to find a set C=(c1,...,ck) of k points and a partition of P into k clusters C1,...,Ck such that the sum of squared errors i=1kp Ci |p -ci |22 is minimized. For given centers this cost function is minimized byassigning points to the nearest center.The k-means cost function is probably the most widely used cost function in the area of clustering.In this paper we show that every unweighted point set P has a weak (, k)-coreset of size Poly(k,1/) for the k-means clustering problem, i.e. its size is independent of the cardinality |P| of the point set and the dimension d of the Euclidean space Rd. A weak coreset is a weighted set S P together with a set T such that T contains a (1+)-approximation for the optimal cluster centers from P and for every set of kcenters from T the cost of the centers for S is a (1±)-approximation of the cost for P.We apply our weak coreset to obtain a PTAS for the k-means clustering problem with running time O(nkd + d Poly(k/) + 2Õ(k/ε)).","authors":["Dan Feldman","Morteza Monemizadeh","Christian Sohler"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1247069.1247072","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry, Gyeongju, South Korea, June 6-8, 2007"],"references":["234804011_Applications_of_weighted_Voronoi_diagrams_and_randomization_to_variance-based-clustering","234054500_Optimal_Time_Bounds_for_Approximate_Clustering","228057833_The_Geometry_of_Graphs_and_Some_of_Its_Algorithmic_Applications","224678297_The_Effectiveness_of_Lloyd-Type_Methods_for_the_k-Means_Problem","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","245848484_Decompositional_searching_problems_I_static-to-dynamic_transformations","243183177_On_k-Median_clustering_in_high_dimensions","238990297_Decision_theoretic_generalization_of_the_pac_model_for_neural_net_and_other_learning_applications","227273551_On_Approximate_Geometric_k-Clustering","226410503_Smaller_Coresets_for_k-Median_and_k-Means_Clustering"]}
