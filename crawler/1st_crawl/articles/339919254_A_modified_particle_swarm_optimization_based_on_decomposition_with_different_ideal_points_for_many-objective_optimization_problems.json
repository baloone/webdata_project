In this paper, we propose a modified particle swarm optimization based on decomposition framework with different ideal points on each reference vector, called MPSO/DD, for many-objective optimization problems. In the MPSO/DD algorithm, the decomposition strategy is used to ensure the diversity of the population, and the ideal point on each reference vector can draw the population converge faster to the optimal front. The position of each individual will be updated by learning the demonstrators in its neighborhood that have less distance to the ideal point along the reference vector. Eight state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-/many-objective optimization algorithms are adopted to compare the performance with MPSO/DD for solving many-objective optimization problems. The experimental results on seven DTLZ test problems with 3, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 objectives, respectively, show the efficiency of our proposed method on solving problems with high-dimensional objective space.","authors":["Shufen Qin","Chaoli Sun","Guochen Zhang","Xiaojuan He"],"meta":["March 2020Complex & Intelligent Systems 6(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40747-020-00134-7"],"references":["319482375_An_Indicator_Based_Multi-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_with_Reference_Point_Adaptation_for_Better_Versatility","315841610_An_Improved_Decomposition-Based_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_with_a_better_Balance_of_Convergence_and_Diversity","312308071_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_With_a_Balanceable_Fitness_Estimation_for_Many-Objective_Optimization_Problems","312061859_PlatEMO_A_MATLAB_Platform_for_Evolutionary_Multi-Objective_Optimization","289825861_A_Reference_Vector_Guided_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","335069502_A_New_Selection_Strategy_for_Decomposition-based_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization","305001282_A_Vector_Angle-Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Unconstrained_Many-Objective_Optimization","304757007_A_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Reference_Direction_for_Multiobjective_and_Many-Objective_Optimization","304293357_Balancing_Convergence_and_Diversity_by_Using_Two_Different_Reproduction_Operators_in_MOEAD_Some_Preliminary_Work","284048685_The_particle_swarm_explosion_stability_and_convergence_in_multi-dimensional_complex_space"]}
