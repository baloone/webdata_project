{"id":"261282487_Tool_support_for_an_automatic_transformation_of_GRAFCET_specifications_into_IEC_61131-3_control_code","abstract":"GRAphe Fonctionnel de Commande Etape Transition (GRAFCET) is a powerful graphical modeling language for the specification of discrete event systems and an international standard since 1988. Since GRAFCET is a specification language and not a programming language, a GRAFCET specification (Grafcet) still has to be interpreted manually, e.g. as a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program according to IEC 61131-3. For this reason, the authors subsequently present a tool prototype, which allows the development of a Grafcet according to IEC 60848 definitions and additionally offers the opportunity to automatically generate IEC 61131-3 compliant control code. To facilitate tool integration into industrial applications, the prototype is based on a widely-used office software.","authors":["Frank Schumacher","Sebastian Schr√∂ck","Alexander Fay"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/ETFA.2013.6648109","Conference: Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA), 2013 IEEE 18th Conference on"],"references":["281462947_A_primer_on_the_Petri_Net_Markup_Language_and_ISOIEC_15909-2","228930799_Translating_Grafcet_specifications_into_Mealy_machines_for_conformance_test_purposes","29611764_Logic_controllers_dependability_verification_using_a_plant_model","316807690_Discrete_Continuous_and_Hybrid_Petri_Nets","313211796_Close_integration_between_UML_and_IEC_61131-3_New_possibilities_through_object-oriented_extensions","271477821_Logic_controllers_dependability_verification_using_a_plant_model","271465760_Transforming_Hierarchical_Concepts_of_GRAFCET_into_a_Suitable_Petri_Net_Formalism","261268707_Transforming_time_constraints_of_a_GRAFCET_graph_into_a_suitable_Petri_net_formalism","252053304_Requirements_and_obstacles_for_the_transformation_of_GRAFCET_specifications_into_IEC_61131-3_PLC_programs","239831043_Software_and_Systems_Engineering_-_High-level_Petri_Nets_-_Part_2_Transfer_Format","224087296_Close_integration_between_UML_and_IEC_61131-3_New_possibilities_through_object-oriented_extensions","3207988_Discrete_Continuous_and_Hybrid_Petri_Nets"]}
