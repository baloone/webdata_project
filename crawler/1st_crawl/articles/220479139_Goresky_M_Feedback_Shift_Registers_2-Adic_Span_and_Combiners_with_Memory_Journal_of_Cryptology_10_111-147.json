Many parallels with the theory of linear feedback shift registers (LFSR's) are presented, including a synthesis algorithm (analogous to the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for LFSR's) which, for any pseudorandom sequence, constructs the smallest FCSR which will generate the sequence. These techniques are used to attack the summation cipher. This analysis gives a unified approach to the study of pseudorandom sequences, arithmetic codes, combiners with memory, and the Marsaglia-Zaman random number generator. Possible variations on the FCSR architecture are indicated at the end.
