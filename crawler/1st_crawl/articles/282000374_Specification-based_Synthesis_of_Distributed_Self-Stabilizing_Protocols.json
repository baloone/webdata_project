{"id":"282000374_Specification-based_Synthesis_of_Distributed_Self-Stabilizing_Protocols","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an SMT based method that automatically\nsynthesizes a distributed self stabilizing protocol from a given high level\nspecification and the network topology. Unlike existing approaches, where\nsynthesis algorithms require the explicit description of the set of legitimate\nstates, our technique only needs the temporal behavior of the protocol. We also\nextend our approach to synthesize ideal stabilizing protocols, where every\nstate is legitimate. Our proposed methods are fully implemented and we report\nsuccessful synthesis of Dijkstra`s token ring and a self stabilizing version of\nRaymond`s mutual exclusion algorithm, as well as ideal stabilizing leader\nelection and local mutual exclusion.","authors":["Fathiyeh Faghih","Borzoo Bonakdarpour","Sebastien Tixeuil","Sandeep Kulkarni"],"meta":["September 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["226014121_Symbolic_synthesis_of_masking_fault-tolerant_distributed_programs","300009759_Synthesizing_Self-stabilization_through_Superposition_and_Backtracking","285448511_On_the_Complexity_of_Adding_Convergence","280531035_SMT-Based_Synthesis_of_Distributed_Self-Stabilizing_Systems","273166810_Specification-Based_Design_of_Self-Stabilization","262334289_On_the_Self-stabilization_of_Mobile_Oblivious_Robots_in_Uniform_Rings","239552157_Self_stabilizing_systems_in_spite_of_distributed_control","227236993_Self-stabilizing_group_communication_in_directed_networks","221540552_Multicore_Constraint-Based_Automated_Stabilization","221540443_Self-Stabilizing_Group_Communication_in_Directed_Networks"]}
