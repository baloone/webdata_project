{"id":"235008632_Theory_of_codes_with_maximum_rank_distance_translation","abstract":"The article considers codes over GF(q**N). A new metric, called the rank metric, is introduced; the maximum number of coordinates of vector x equals (x//1,. . . ,x//n) that are linearly dependent over GF(Q) is called its norm. For this metric a theory analogous to the theory of MBD codes is formulated. Codes with maximum rank distance are described; their spectrum is obtained; and encoding and decoding algorithms are given.","authors":["Ernst Gabidulin"],"meta":["January 1985Problems of Information Transmission 21(1):1-12"],"references":[]}
