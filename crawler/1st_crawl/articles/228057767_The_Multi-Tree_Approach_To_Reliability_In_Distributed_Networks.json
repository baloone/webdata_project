{"id":"228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","abstract":"A network of asynchronous processors communicating by sending messages over unreliable lines is considered. There are many advantages to restricting all communications to a spanning tree. To overcome the possible failure of k prime greater than k edges, the authors describe a communication protocol that uses k-rooted spanning trees having the property that for every vertex v the paths from v to the root are edge-disjoint. A linear algorithm for finding two such trees in a 2-edge-connected graph is described. This algorithm has a distributed version that finds the two trees even when a single edge fails during their construction. Finally, a method is given for transforming centralized algorithms to distributed, reliable, and efficient ones.","authors":["Alon Itai","Michael Rodeh"],"meta":["January 1984Information and Control 79:43-59","DOI:10.1109/SFCS.1984.715910"],"references":["220898525_Covering_a_Graph_by_Circuits","267187308_On_Orientations_Connectivity_and_Odd-Vertex-Pairings_in_Finite_Graphs","256554846_Computing_an_st-Numbering","242577925_An_algorithm_for_planarity_testing_of_graphs","228057708_Edge-disjoint_Branchings","223126082_Depth-First_Search_is_Inherently_Sequential","220617351_Covering_Graphs_by_Simple_Circuits","220114012_A_Good_Algorithm_for_Edge-Disjoint_Branching","220113584_Edge-Disjoint_Branching_in_Directed_Multigraphs","200031719_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process"]}
