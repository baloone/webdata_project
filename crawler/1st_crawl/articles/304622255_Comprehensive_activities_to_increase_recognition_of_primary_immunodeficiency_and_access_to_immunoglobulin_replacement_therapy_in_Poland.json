This is the result of comprehensive activities by PWGID supported by governmental institutions, outstanding foundations, and patient's organization.\n\nWhat is known: \n• Immunoglobulins' treatment has substantially changed the life of individuals with PAD. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) can live and lead a near normal life. Early diagnosis of the disease followed by earlier implementation of appropriate treatment, including gammaglobulin replacement therapy, improves the quality of life. • Targeted efforts of health care professionals and government are required to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic approach for PAD. What is New: • Comprehensive activities of PWGID lead to better recognition of PID individuals and should improve reporting Polish PIDs to the ESID database. • Following the joint efforts of immunologists, patient's, and governmental organizations in the end of 2014, the Therapeutic Program for Treatment Adults with PID was introduced, leading to universal access to currently available treatment options and to improve the quality of life.","authors":["Malgorzata Pac","Ewa Bernatowska"],"meta":["August 2016European Journal of Pediatrics 175(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00431-016-2746-2"],"references":["288381136_Twenty_five_years_of_investigations_into_primary_immunodeficiency_diseases_in_the_Department_of_Immunology_the_Children's_Memorial_Health_Institute_Warsaw","270220602_Europe_Immunoglobulin_Map","269700611_Primary_immune_deficiencies_-_principles_of_care","295690982_The_French_national_registry_of_primary_immunodeficiency_diseases","282731831_Primary_Immunodeficiency_Diseases_an_Update_on_the_Classification_from_the_International_Union_of_Immunological_Societies_Expert_Committee_for_Primary_Immunodeficiency","277560965_The_Swiss_National_Registry_for_Primary_Immunodeficiencies_Report_on_the_first_6_years'_activity_2008-2014","267928382_Primary_immunodeficiencies_in_the_Netherlands_National_patient_data_demonstrate_the_increased_risk_of_malignancy","266945373_Epidemiology_of_Primary_Immunodeficiency_in_Iceland","265691715_The_use_of_databases_in_primary_immunodeficiencies","260485259_Clinical_picture_and_treatment_of_2212_patients_with_common_variable_immunodeficiency","236264671_The_German_National_Registry_for_Primary_Immunodeficiencies_PID","224919232_Primary_Immunodeficiency_Diseases_An_Update_on_the_Classification_from_the_International_Union_of_Immunological_Societies_Expert_Committee_for_Primary_Immunodeficiency","259635091_Modeling_Primary_Immunodeficiency_Disease_Epidemiology_and_Its_Treatment_to_Estimate_Latent_Therapeutic_Demand_for_Immunoglobulin","248396066_The_United_Kingdom_Primary_Immune_Deficiency_UKPID_Registry_Report_of_the_first_4_years'_activity_2008-2012","236091981_Controversies_in_IgG_replacement_therapy_in_patients_with_antibody_deficiency_diseases"]}
