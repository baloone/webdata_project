{"id":"321254293_An_imperialist_competitive_algorithm_in_mixed-model_assembly_line_sequencing_problem_to_minimise_unfinished_works","abstract":"Mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) are a type of production lines where a variety of product models similar to product characteristics are assembled in a just-in-time production system. Usually, MMAL consists of a number of stations linked by a conveyor belt and each station has a work zone limited by upstream and downstream boundaries. To avoid improper interference between operators in the adjacent stations and excess of machine moving range, operators are forced to complete their operations within their predetermined work zone. There is a set of criteria on which to judge sequences of product models in terms of the effective utilisation of these lines. In this paper, the sequence of models for minimising the total unfinished work within their work zone is discussed. A novel imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is developed for solving this problem in small-, medium- and large-scale problems. The solutions obtained via ICA are compared against solutions obtained via B&B, a heuristic procedure, GRASP and BDP-2 in small problems, and also against a proposed genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing in small, medium and large problems. Experimental results show that this algorithm provides reasonably good solutions with low computational costs.","authors":["Mostafa Zandieh","Hadi Moradi"],"meta":["November 2017International Journal of Systems Science 6(2):1-14","DOI:10.1080/23302674.2017.1401152","Project: Mixed-model assembly line sequencing problem"],"references":["271924591_Two-sided_assembly_line_balancing_with_operator_number_and_task_constraints_a_hybrid_imperialist_competitive_algorithm","307513552_A_hybrid_dynamic_programming_for_solving_a_mixed-model_sequencing_problem_with_production_mix_restriction_and_free_interruptions","287151665_GRASP_for_sequencing_mixed_models_in_an_assembly_line_with_work_overload_useless_time_and_production_regularity","281137350_Consideration_of_human_resources_in_the_Mixed-model_Sequencing_Problem_with_Work_Overload_Minimization_Legal_provisions_and_productivity_improvement","280939966_Quality_Engineering_Using_Robust_Design","279618362_Modifying_Mixed-Model_Assembly_Line_Sequencing_Methods_to_Consider_Weighted_Variations_for_Just-In-Time_Production_Systems","279395066_Toyota_Production_System","279368822_The_Toyota_Production_System","279368493_Toyota_Production_System","276955642_Scheduling_algorithms_to_minimize_utility_work_at_a_single_station_on_a_paced_assembly_line","276425213_Modeling_and_solving_multi-objective_mixed-model_assembly_line_balancing_and_worker_assignment_problem","275252266_Scheduling_of_multi-component_products_in_a_two-stage_flexible_flow_shop","264558724_Engineering_Statistics","257161686_Order_acceptancerejection_policies_in_determining_the_sequence_in_mixed_model_assembly_lines","257119222_Zandieh_M_An_imperialist_competitive_algorithm_for_a_mixed-model_assembly_line_sequencing_problem_Journal_of_Manufacturing_Systems_321_46-54","256570203_A_sequencing_problem_for_a_mixed-model_assembly_line_in_a_JIT_production_system","245330187_Sequencing_Jobs_on_an_Automobile_Assembly_Line_Objectives_and_Procedures","243779885_Algorithms_for_Scheduling_Multi-Level_Just-In-Time_Production_Systems","240915118_Product_sequencing_problem_in_Mixed-Model_Assembly_Line_to_minimize_unfinished_works","229346344_Designing_a_mixed-model_assembly_line_to_minimize_the_costs_of_idle_and_utility_times","227851768_Efficient_methods_for_sequencing_minimum_job_sets_on_mixed_model_assembly_lines","227446747_Mixed-Model_Sequencing_to_Minimize_Utility_Work_and_the_Risk_of_Conveyor_Stoppage","227446523_Level_Schedules_for_Mixed-Model_Just-In-Time_Processes","227446297_Sequencing_to_Minimize_Work_Overload_in_Assembly_Lines_with_Product_Options","227414931_Solving_mixed_model_sequencing_problem_in_assembly_lines_with_serial_workstations_with_work_overload_minimisation_and_interruption_rules","224302036_Imperialist_Competitive_Algorithm_An_Algorithm_for_Optimization_Inspired_by_Imperialistic_Competition","223539427_Algorithms_for_Real-Time_Scheduling_of_Jobs_on_Mixed_Model_Assembly_Lines","222997531_Improved_immune_algorithm_for_global_numerical_optimization_and_job-shop_scheduling_problems","222812108_Minimizing_work_overload_in_mixed-model_assembly_lines","222036796_Algorithms_for_sequencing_mixed_models_on_an_assembly_line_in_a_JIT_production_system","46475797_Sequencing_mixed-model_assembly_lines_to_minimize_the_number_of_work_overload_situations"]}
