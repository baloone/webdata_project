{"id":"243418691_TOPICAL_REVIEW_Deterministic_thermostats_theories_of_nonequilibrium_systems_and_parallels_with_the_ergodic_condition","abstract":"Deterministic 'thermostats' are mathematical tools used to model nonequilibrium steady states of fluids. The resulting dynamical systems correctly represent the transport properties of these fluids and are easily simulated on modern computers. More recently, the connection between such thermostats and entropy production has been exploited in the development of nonequilibrium fluid theories. The purpose and limitations of deterministic thermostats are discussed in the context of irreversible thermodynamics and the development of theories of nonequilibrium phenomena. We draw parallels between the development of such nonequilibrium theories and the development of notions of ergodicity in equilibrium theories.","authors":["Owen Jepps","Lamberto Rondoni"],"meta":["April 2010Journal of Physics A Mathematical and Theoretical 43(13)","DOI:10.1088/1751-8113/43/13/133001"],"references":["287996327_Canonical_Dynamics_Equilibrium_Phase-Space_Distributions","260785375_Thermostats_for_Slow''_Configurational_Modes","257995764_New_observations_regarding_deterministic_time-reversible_thermostats_and_Gauss's_principle_of_least_constraint","257993285_Configurational_temperature_Verification_of_Monte_Carlo_simulations","256142641_Isothermal_Molecular_Dynamics_Calculations_for_Liquid_Salts","243370255_Supersymmetric_Yang-Mills_equations_and_supertwistors","241283060_INVITED_ARTICLE_Fluctuations_in_nonequilibrium_statistical_mechanics_models_mathematical_theory_physical_mechanisms","268895559_The_Art_of_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulaton","264965169_Microscopic_Chaos_Fractals_and_Transport_in_Nonequilibrium_Statistical_Mechanics","263558665_On_amplitudes_in_the_self-dual_sector_of_Yang-Mills_theory","261143709_Generalized_Hamiltonian_Dynamics","259073665_The_Quantum_Theory_of_Fields","257291005_Unraveling_mathcal_L_n_k_grassmannian_kinematics","256532369_Equilibrium_time_correlation_functions_under_gaussian_isothermal_dynamics","255885462_Asymptotic_Form_of_the_Structure_Function_for_Real_Systems","255212631_Dual_superconformal_symmetry_from_AdS_5_S_5_superstring_integrability","253703636_Instantons_and_monopoles_in_Yang-Mills_gauge_field_theories","253486024_The_Fermi-Pasta-Ulam_Problem","253283091_Supersymmetric_instanton","253064975_Ergodicity_in_simple_and_not_so_simple_systems_and_Kubo's_condition","252521959_High-Strain-Rate_Plastic_Flow_Studied_via_Nonequilibrium_Molecular_Dynamics","248864279_Conversations_on_Nonequilibrium_Physics_With_an_Extraterrestrial","247261059_Probability_of_second_law_violations_in_steady_flows","246204013_Fluctuations_and_irreversible_processes_I","244599564_Configurational_temperature_and_pressure_molecular_dynamics_Review_of_current_methodology_and_applications_to_the_shear_flow_of_a_simple_fluid","243545538_Contributions_to_Statistical_Mechanics_Far_from_Equilibrium_IV_Improved_and_Simplified_Treatment_of_Non-Steady_States","243545476_Application_of_Mode-Coupling_Theory_to_Nonlinear_Stress_Tensor_in_Fluids","243389495_Supermanifolds","243311324_Kac-Moody_algebras_and_exact_solvability_in_hadronic_physics","243264545_Super-selfduality_for_supersymmetric_Yang-Mills_theory","243208011_Multigluon_cross_sections_and_5-jet_production_at_hadron_colliders","243106535_Uber_Ein_Neues_Allgemeines_Grundgesetz_der_Mechanik","242359864_Two-loop_amplitudes_of_gluons_and_octa-cuts_in_Script_N_4_super_Yang-Mills","241779660_One-loop_N8_supergravity_amplitudes_from_MHV_diagrams","241611708_Computer_''experiment''_for_nonlinear_thermodynamics_of_Couette_flow","240664990_Statistical-Mechanical_Theory_of_Irreversible_Processes_I_General_Theory_and_Simple_Applications_to_Magnetic_and_Conduction_Problems","239557996_TASI_Lectures_on_Solitons_Instantons_Monopoles_Vortices_and_Kinks","239442544_A_super_MHV_vertex_expansion_for_n4_SYM_theory","239015883_Dimostrazione_che_in_generale_un_sistema_meccanico_normale_E_QUASI_-_ergodico","238922500_The_hidden_symmetry_of_chiral_fields_and_the_Riemann-Hilbert_problem","238484238_Scattering_into_the_fifth_dimension_of_N_4_super_Yang-Mills","238017807_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Nonequilibrium_Liquids","237566323_Current_uctuations_in_the_nonequilibrium_Lorentz_gas","236753480_Temporal_asymmetry_of_fluctuations_in_the_nonequilibrium_FPU_model","235496923_Theory_of_Nonlinear_Transport_Processes_Nonlinear_Shear_Viscosity_and_Normal_Stress_Effects","235470424_Kac-Moody_algebra_in_the_self-dual_Yang-Mills_equation","235470271_Leading_singularities_of_the_two-loop_six-particle_maximally_helicity_violating_amplitude","235459750_More_about_hidden-symmetry_algebra_for_the_self-dual_Yang-Mills_system","235446089_Supergravity_and_the_S_matrix","234990716_Entropy_and_Molecular_Correlation_Functions_in_Open_Systems_I_Derivation","234952912_Nonequilibrium_thermostats_and_thermodynamic_limit","234914790_On_the_effects_of_assuming_flow_profiles_in_nonequilibrium_simulations","234953941_Reply_to_''Comment_on_Extensions_of_the_molecular_dynamics_simulation_method_II_Isothermal_systems''","234944677_The_Nose-Hoover_thermostat","234912975_Diffusion_in_Lennard-Jones_Fluids_Using_Dual_Control_Volume_Grand_Canonical_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation_DCV-GCMD"]}
