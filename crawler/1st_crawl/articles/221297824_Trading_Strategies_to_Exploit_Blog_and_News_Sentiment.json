{"id":"221297824_Trading_Strategies_to_Exploit_Blog_and_News_Sentiment","abstract":"We use quantitative news data generated by a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) news analysis system to perform a comprehensive study on how a company's re- ported news frequency, sentiment polarity and subjectivity anticipates or reflects its stock trading volumes and finan- cial returns. Our analysis provides concrete evidence that news data is highly informative, as previously suggested in the literature - but never studied on our scale of over 500 newspapers daily for over four years. Building on our find- ings, we give a news-based market-neutral trading strategy which gives consistently favorable returns with low volatil- ity over a four year period (2005-2008). Our results are significant in confirming the performance of general senti- ment analysis methods over broad domains and sources.","authors":["Wenbin Zhang","Steven Skiena"],"meta":["January 2010","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, ICWSM 2010, Washington, DC, USA, May 23-26, 2010"],"references":["228892903_Using_news_articles_to_predict_stock_price_movements","222535436_Stock_Price_Reaction_to_News_and_No-News_Drift_and_Reversal_after_Headlines","221614593_Language_Models_for_Financial_News_Recommendation","221580193_Lydia_A_System_for_Large-Scale_News_Analysis","220895244_News_Sensitive_Stock_Trend_Prediction","215470679_Movie_Review_Mining_a_Comparison_between_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Classification_Approaches","228877499_Text_mining_systems_for_market_response_to_news_A_survey","224890479_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","224683309_NewsCATS_A_news_categorization_and_trading_system","221298077_International_Sentiment_Analysis_for_News_and_Blogs","215470709_Large-Scale_Sentiment_Analysis_for_News_and_Blogs","5176857_What_Moves_Stock_Prices","4992674_Is_All_That_Talk_Just_Noise_The_Information_Content_of_Internet_Stock_Message_Boards"]}
