{"id":"228768181_Search_and_Pursuit-evasion_in_Mobile_Robotics","abstract":"This paper surveys recent results in pursuit-evasion and autonomous search relevant to applications in mobile robotics. We provide a taxonomy of search problems that highlights the differences resulting from varying assumptions on the searchers, targets, and the environment. We then list a number of fundamental results in the areas of pursuit-evasion and probabilistic search, and we discuss field implementations on mobile robotic systems. In addition, we highlight current open problems in the area and explore avenues for future work.","authors":["Timothy Chung","Geoffrey Anton Hollinger","Volkan Isler"],"meta":["November 2011Autonomous Robots 31(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10514-011-9241-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["296833045_Branch_and_bound_methods_for_a_search_problem","275623071_The_Theory_of_Search_I_Kinematic_Bases","274180381_A_Mathematician's_Miscellany","266436782_A_mathematician's_miscellany_Matematicheskaya_smes'_Transl_from_the_English_by_V_I_Levin_5th_ed_rev","266019873_About_a_man_and_lions","265540923_Search_and_Its_Optimization","264957063_A_Mathematician's_Miscellany","263983505_A_VISIBILITY-BASED_PURSUIT-EVASION_PROBLEM","263561179_The_complexity_of_pursuit_on_a_graph","262406817_Finding_Approximate_POMDP_solutions_Through_Belief_Compression"]}
