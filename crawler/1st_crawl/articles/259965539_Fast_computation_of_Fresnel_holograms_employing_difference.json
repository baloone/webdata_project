{"id":"259965539_Fast_computation_of_Fresnel_holograms_employing_difference","abstract":"For practical holographic video system, it is important to generated\nholographic fringe as fast as possible. We have proposed an\napproximation method that can calculate the Fresnel hologram fast. To\ncompute the hologram, an object is assumed as a collection of\nself-illuminated points and the fringes from each object point are\nsuperposed. To determine the fringe, a distance between object point and\nsampling point on the hologram is used to obtain phase of the light.\nSince sampled hologram usually has small pixel intervals, the difference\nof the distance values between adjacent pixels is also small and its\nn-th order difference becomes a constant. Therefore, the distance value\nat certain pixel can be obtained from the neighbor pixel with simple\nadditions. We have investigated approximation errors and computational\nspeed of the method. The numerical results show that the proposed method\nis quite effective. The distance error can be reduced less that one\nwavelength with practical parameters and the computational speed becomes\n16 times faster than conventional method. With the proposed method, a\nhologram, which has horizontal parallax only, 1.3 mega- pixels and 1,000\nobject points, can be calculated less than on second with a personal\ncomputer.","authors":["Hiroshi Yoshikawa","Susumu Iwase","Tadashi Oneda"],"meta":["March 2000Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering 3956:48-55"],"references":[]}
