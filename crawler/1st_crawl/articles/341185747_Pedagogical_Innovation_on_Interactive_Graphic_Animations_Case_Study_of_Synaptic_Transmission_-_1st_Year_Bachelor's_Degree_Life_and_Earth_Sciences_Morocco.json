This paper reports aims to study the evolution of the conceptions of students in the first year of the baccalaureate, option life and earth sciences concerning the concept of synaptic transmission by using animation. This course covers many concepts that are difficult to teach and learn due to the impossibility of visualizing and manipulating in the real world. To achieve our objective, which is to study the impact of animations on studentsâ€™ learning, we worked with two groups, a control group with which we chose the traditional method of using textbooks and an experimental group with which we used interactive graphic images and animations as teaching tools. The results showed that the learners in the experimental group, who received the course in an innovative way, performed better than the learners in the control group who used traditional teaching tools.","authors":["Sara el Hammoumi","Rajae Zerhane","Rachid Janati-Idrissi"],"meta":["January 2020SSRN Electronic Journal 3(1)","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3584413"],"references":["281318139_Functions_of_animations_in_comprehension_and_learning","228363751_The_animation_and_interactivity_principles_in_multimedia_learning","221517316_Does_Animation_in_User_Interfaces_Improve_Decision_Making","7823627_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology_Animations_Development_and_Impact_on_Student_Learning","294695360_Color_graphics_and_animation_in_a_computer-assisted_learning_tutorial_lesson","272435621_La_charte_nationale_d'education-formation","248975135_Using_Static_and_Dynamic_Visuals_to_Represent_Chemical_Change_at_Molecular_Level","248498154_Instructional_animation_versus_static_pictures_A_meta-analysis","225115576_Learning_Using_Dynamic_and_Static_Visualizations_Students'_Comprehension_Prior_Knowledge_and_Conceptual_Status_of_a_Biotechnological_Method","220663170_Erratum_Who_benefits_from_learning_with_3D_models_The_case_of_spatial_ability_Journal_of_Computer_Assisted_Learning_2006_22_392-404"]}
