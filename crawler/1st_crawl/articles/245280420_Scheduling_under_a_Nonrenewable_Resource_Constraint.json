{"id":"245280420_Scheduling_under_a_Nonrenewable_Resource_Constraint","abstract":"This paper examines a single-machine, non-renewable-resource-constrained scheduling problem where jobs have arbitrary processing times and resource requirements. Unit supply of a resource is assumed at each time period. Performance criterion is makespan. It is proved that this problem is identical to the two-machine flowshop problem, enabling the use of Johnson's algorithm. Immediate extensions of this result are presented.","authors":["Aysegul Toker","Suna KÃ¶ksalan Kondakci","M. H.
