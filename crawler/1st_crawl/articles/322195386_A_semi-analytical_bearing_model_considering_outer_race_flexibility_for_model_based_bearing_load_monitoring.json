{"id":"322195386_A_semi-analytical_bearing_model_considering_outer_race_flexibility_for_model_based_bearing_load_monitoring","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel semi-analytical bearing model addressing flexibility of the bearing outer race structure. It furthermore presents the application of this model in a bearing load condition monitoring approach. The bearing model is developed as current computational low cost bearing models fail to provide an accurate description of the more and more common flexible size and weight optimized bearing designs due to their assumptions of rigidity. In the proposed bearing model raceway flexibility is described by the use of static deformation shapes. The excitation of the deformation shapes is calculated based on the modelled rolling element loads and a Fourier series based compliance approximation. The resulting model is computational low cost and provides an accurate description of the rolling element loads for flexible outer raceway structures. The latter is validated by a simulation-based comparison study with a well-established bearing simulation software tool. An experimental study finally shows the potential of the proposed model in a bearing load monitoring approach.","authors":["Stijn Kerst","Barys Shyrokau","Edward Holweg"],"meta":["May 2018Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 104:384-397","DOI:10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.11.008"],"references":["317553289_Full_Dynamic_Ball_Bearing_Model_with_Elastic_Outer_Ring_for_High_Speed_Applications","312350814_Wheel_force_measurement_for_vehicle_dynamics_control_using_an_intelligent_bearing","302848504_Bearing_monitoring_using_a_fiber_Bragg_grating","301273121_Reconstruction_of_Wheel_Forces_Using_an_Intelligent_Bearing","277247629_Anti-Lock_Braking_Control_Based_on_Bearing_Load_Sensing","262911869_Combined_Vibration_and_Thermal_Analysis_for_the_Condition_Monitoring_of_Rotating_Machinery","258440016_Prognostics_and_health_management_design_for_rotary_machinery_systems-Reviews_methodology_and_applications","245367037_3D_Simplified_Finite_Elements_Analysis_of_Load_and_Contact_Angle_in_a_Slewing_Ball_Bearing","241638093_Capacitive_Sensor_Device_for_Measuring_Loads_on_Bearings","237675815_Bearing_defect_diagnosis_and_acoustic_emission","314703633_Continuous_wheel_force_measurement_for_passenger_vehicles_and_commercial_vehicles","313017155_A_comparison_of_cepstral_editing_methods_as_signal_pre-processing_techniques_for_vibration-based_bearing_fault_detection","312503805_Lubricating_Oil_Conditioning_Sensors_for_Online_Machine_Health_Monitoring_-_A_Review","302060040_Load_sensing_bearing_based_road-tyre_friction_estimation_considering_combined_tyre_slip","286479732_A_review_of_wind_turbine_bearing_condition_monitoring_State_of_the_art_and_challenges","284243071_Acoustic_emission-based_condition_monitoring_methods_Review_and_application_for_low_speed_slew_bearing","282491031_Distributed_bearing_fault_diagnosis_based_on_vibration_analysis","275093594_A_General_Theory_for_Elastically_Constrained_Ball_and_Radial_Roller_Bearings_Under_Arbitrary_Load_and_Speed_Conditions","273398943_A_summary_of_fault_modeling_and_predictive_health_monitoring_of_rolling_element_bearings","267047895_A_time-dependent_parametric_model_order_reduction_technique_for_modelling_indirect_bearing_force_measurements","258805384_Roller_element_bearing_fault_diagnosis_using_singular_spectrum_analysis","247161422_Four-Point_Contact_Ball_Bearing_Model_With_Deformable_Rings","245388359_BEAST_-_A_rolling_bearing_simulation_tool","245387568_Dynamic_behaviour_of_rolling_bearings_Simulations_and_experiments","245370049_Static_Rolling_Bearing_Models_in_a_CAD_Environment_for_the_Study_of_Complex_Mechanisms_Part_I-Rolling_Bearing_Model","245369618_Equilibrium_and_Associated_Load_Distribution_in_Ball_and_Roller_Bearings_Loaded_in_Five_Degrees_of_Freedom_While_Neglecting_Friction-Part_I_General_Theory_and_Application_to_Ball_Bearings","245368898_Rolling_Bearing_Analysis","245314686_Analysis_of_High-Speed_Intershaft_Cylindrical_Roller_Bearing_with_Flexible_Rings","236236241_Infrared_Thermography_for_Condition_Monitoring-_A_Review","233758771_Theoretical_Analysis_of_High-Speed_Cylindrical_Roller_Bearing_with_Flexible_Rings_Mounted_in_a_Squeeze_Film_Damper","223740431_Intelligent_monitoring_of_ball_bearing_conditions","223733156_Nonlinear_dynamic_analysis_of_cylindrical_roller_bearing_with_flexible_rings","222755767_Rolling_element_bearing_diagnostics_in_run-to-failure_lifetime_testing","222662373_Towards_automatic_detection_of_local_bearing_defects_in_rotating_machines","222504620_A_Review_of_Vibration_and_Acoustic_Measurement_Methods_for_the_Detection_of_Defects_in_Rolling_Element_Bearings","222129909_An_integrated_approach_to_fault_diagnosis_of_machinery_using_wear_debris_and_vibration_analysis"]}
