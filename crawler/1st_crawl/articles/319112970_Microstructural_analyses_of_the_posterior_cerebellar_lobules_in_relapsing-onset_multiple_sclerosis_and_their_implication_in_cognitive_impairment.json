Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated within each lobule and in the cerebellar peduncles. We investigated the correlations between cognitive outcomes and the diffusion parameters of cerebellar sub-structures and performed multiple linear regression analysis to predict cognitive disability.\n\nResults\nFA was generally lower and MD was higher in the cerebellum and specifically in the vermis Crus II, lobules VIIb and VIIIb in CIPwMS compared with PwCIS and HS. In hierarchical regression analyses, 31% of the working memory z score variance was explained by FA in the left lobule VI and in the left superior peduncle. Working memory was also associated with MD in the vermis Crus II. FA in the left lobule VI and right VIIIa predicted part of the information processing speed (IPS) z scores.\n\nConclusion\nDTI indicators of cerebellar microstructural damage were associated with cognitive deficits in MS. Our results suggested that cerebellar lobular alterations have an impact on attention, working memory and IPS.","authors":["Amandine Moroso","Aur√©lie Ruet","Delphine Lamargue-Hamel","Fanny Munsch"],"meta":["August 2017PLoS ONE 12(8)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0182479"],"references":["324237011_Cerebellar_Projections_to_the_Prefrontal_Cortex_of_the_Primate","283525440_Cognitive_evaluation_by_tasks_in_a_virtual_reality_environment_in_multiple_sclerosis","275647428_DIR-visible_grey_matter_lesions_and_atrophy_in_multiple_sclerosis_Partners_in_crime","272098112_Clinical_and_imaging_assessment_of_cognitive_dysfunction_in_multiple_sclerosis","264127084_Microstructural_Changes_in_the_Striatum_and_Their_Impact_on_Motor_and_Neuropsychological_Performance_in_Patients_with_Multiple_Sclerosis","309518416_Posterior_lobules_of_the_cerebellum_and_information_processing_speed_at_various_stages_of_multiple_sclerosis","297591790_The_substrate_of_increased_cortical_FA_in_MS_A_7T_post-mortem_MRI_and_histopathology_study","280328246_Contribution_of_the_cerebellum_to_cognitive_performance_in_children_and_adolescents_with_multiple_sclerosis","269185958_Information_processing_speed_impairment_and_cerebellar_dysfunction_in_relapsing-remitting_multiple_sclerosis","262265047_Thalamic_atrophy_and_cognitive_impairment_in_clinically_isolated_syndrome_and_multiple_sclerosis"]}
