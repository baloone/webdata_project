{"id":"342371575_Online_learning_amid_the_COVID-19_pandemic_Students_perspectives","abstract":"This research study examines the attitudes of Pakistani higher education students towards compulsory digital and distance learning university courses amid Coronavirus (COVID-19). Undergraduate and postgraduate were surveyed to find their perspectives about online education in Pakistan. The findings of the study highlighted that online learning cannot produce desired results in underdeveloped countries like Pakistan, where a vast majority of students are unable to access the internet due to technical as well as monetary issues. The lack of face-to-face interaction with the instructor, response time and absence of traditional classroom socialization were among some other issues highlighted by higher education students.","authors":["Kainat Anwar","Muhammad Adnan"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Pedagogical Research 1(2):45-51","DOI:10.33902/JPSP.2020261309"],"references":["341301384_Best_Practices_in_Middle_Level_Quaranteaching_Strategies_Tips_and_Resources_Amidst_COVID-19","341190633_secondary-school-mathematics-teachers-views-on-e-learning-implementation-barriers-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-the-case-of-indonesia","340680378_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Higher_Education_amid_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_The_Philippine_Context","340560537_Transition_to_Online_Education_in_Schools_during_a_SARS-CoV-2_Coronavirus_COVID-19_Pandemic_in_Georgia","340341491_COVID-19_20_countries'_higher_education_intra-period_digital_pedagogy_responses","340064187_Is_Pakistan_prepared_to_tackle_the_coronavirus_epidemic","339942263_From_Offline_to_Online_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Entrepreneurship_Education_Following_the_COVID-19_Pandemic","283683642_Online_Higher_Education_Beyond_the_Hype_Cycle","261749408_School_closures_during_the_2009_influenza_pandemic_National_and_local_experiences","261461767_FOSS_Localization_A_Solution_for_the_ICT_Dilemma_of_Developing_Countries","26477397_Empowerment_of_women_through_distance_education_in_Pakistan","26477395_Effectiveness_of_mobile_learning_in_distance_education","340063000_WHO_declares_COVID-19_a_pandemic","322781791_Strategic_Barriers_in_the_Effective_Integration_of_ICT_in_the_Public_Schools_of_Pakistan","316748868_Analyzing_the_factors_that_can_limit_the_acceptability_to_introduce_new_specializations_in_higher_education_institutions_A_case_study_of_higher_education_institutions_of_Southern_Punjab_Pakistan","275098329_Identification_and_Prioritization_of_Critical_Issues_for_the_Promotion_of_E-learning_in_Pakistan","267690408_Key_Factors_for_Determining_Student_Satisfaction_in_Distance_Learning_Courses_A_Study_of_Allama_Iqbal_Open_University","220707247_Integrating_m-learning_with_e-learning","7329751_Online_education_a_survey_of_faculty_and_students"]}
