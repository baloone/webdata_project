{"id":"318920444_Toward_Automated_Fact-Checking_Detecting_Check-worthy_Factual_Claims_by_ClaimBuster","abstract":"This paper introduces how ClaimBuster, a fact-checking platform, uses natural language processing and supervised learning to detect important factual claims in political discourses. The claim spotting model is built using a human-labeled dataset of check-worthy factual claims from the U.S. general election debate transcripts. The paper explains the architecture and the components of the system and the evaluation of the model. It presents a case study of how ClaimBuster live covers the 2016 U.S. presidential election debates and monitors social media and Australian Hansard for factual claims. It also describes the current status and the long-term goals of ClaimBuster as we keep developing and expanding it.","authors":["Naeemul Hassan","Fatma Arslan","Chengkai Li","Mark Tremayne"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3097983.3098131","Conference: the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["301801279_The_Quest_to_Automate_Fact-Checking","301800740_Detecting_Check-worthy_Factual_Claims_in_Presidential_Debates","301599046_Discriminative_Predicate_Path_Mining_for_Fact_Checking_in_Knowledge_Graphs","301405022_Fact_Checking_Task_definition_and_dataset_construction","281376035_The_Data_Journalism_Handbook","270905908_Computational_Fact_Checking_from_Knowledge_Networks","299970688_CoupledLP","287571835_Rumor_cascades","287092454_Pillaging_the_environmentalists_The_Cook_Report","276211631_A_Survey_on_Truth_Discovery"]}
