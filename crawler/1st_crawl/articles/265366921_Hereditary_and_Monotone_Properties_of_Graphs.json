{"id":"265366921_Hereditary_and_Monotone_Properties_of_Graphs","abstract":"Given a hereditary graph property Ρ let Ρ\nn\nbe the set of those graphs in Ρ on the vertex set {1, …, n}. Define the constant cn\nby \\(\\left| {P^n } \\right| = 2^{cn(_2^n )} .\\) We show that the limit limn → ∞ cn\nalways exists and equals 1 − 1/r, where r is a positive integer which can be described explicitly in terms of Ρ. This result, obtained independently by Alekseev, extends considerably one of Erdős, Frankl and Rödl concerning principal monotone properties and one of Prömel and Steger concerning principal hereditary properties.\nAMS Subject Classification: Primary 05C35, Secondary 05C30.","authors":["Bela Bollobas","Andrew Thomason"],"meta":["January 1997","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-60406-5_7"],"references":["243778189_Asymptotic_Enumeration_of_Partial_Orders_on_a_Finite_Set","308120882_Extremal_graph_theory","268833229_Hereditary_classes_and_coding_of_graphs","265821290_On_the_structure_of_edge_graphs","265332130_K_l1_-Free_Graphs_Asymptotic_Structure_and_a_0-1_Law","256935666_On_the_Size_of_Hereditary_Classes_of_Graphs","250969212_On_the_entropy_values_of_hereditary_classes_of_graphs","249743197_On_the_Structure_of_Edge_Graphs","244491733_Projections_of_Bodies_and_Hereditary_Properties_of_Hypergraphs","244454505_Asymptotic_enumeration_of_Kn-free_graphs","242535453_On_an_extremal_problem_in_Graph_Theory","241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic","235058342_Regular_Partitions_of_Graphs","230595857_Extremal_Graph_Theory","229749244_Excluding_Induced_Subgraphs_III_A_General_Asymptotic","226589670_The_asymptotic_number_of_graphs_not_containing_a_fixed_subgraph_and_a_problem_for_hypergraphs_having_no_exponent","221569511_The_asymptotic_structure_of_H-free_graphs","220569524_Excluding_Induced_Subgraphs_II_Extremal_Graphs","220358034_Almost_all_Berge_Graphs_are_Perfect","220187866_On_universality_of_graphs_with_uniformly_distributed_edges","31219145_On_the_Erdos-Stone_Theorem"]}
