{"id":"344142412_Performance_and_Sensitivities_of_Home_Detection_on_Mobile_Phone_Data","abstract":"In this chapter, the authors develop one such quality assessment for home detection methods from call detailed record (CDR) data. They argue that little research exists on the validity and related errors of home detection methods and that the sensitivity of results to researcher choices when setting up home detection algorithms (HDAs) is poorly understood. The authors present an extensive empirical analysis of home detection methods when performed on a nationwide CDR dataset of traces from about 18 million mobile phone users in France in 2007. They analyze the validity of nine different HDAs and assess different sources of uncertainty that relate to them and the obtained results. The authors discuss different measures for validation and investigate the sensitivity of results to researcher choices such as HDA parameter choice and observation period restriction. They use aggregated population counts from census data as a ground truth dataset to compare against aggregated user counts.","authors":["Maarten Vanhoof","Clement Lee","Zbigniew Smoreda"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.1002/9781118976357.ch8","In book: Big Data Meets Survey Science (pp.245-271)"],"references":["330286093_Mobile_Phone_Indicators_and_Their_Relation_to_the_Socioeconomic_Organisation_of_Cities","329712197_Assessing_the_Quality_of_Home_Detection_from_Mobile_Phone_Data_for_Official_Statistics","325563327_Comparing_Regional_Patterns_of_Individual_Movement_Using_Corrected_Mobility_Entropy","324139783_Closer_to_the_total_Long-distance_travel_of_French_mobile_phone_users","324108054_Exploring_the_use_of_mobile_phone_data_for_domestic_tourism_trip_analysis","323550345_Understanding_Human_Mobility_Flows_from_Aggregated_Mobile_Phone_Data","321278661_Geographical_veracity_of_indicators_derived_from_mobile_phone_data","316489770_Identifying_and_modeling_the_structural_discontinuities_of_human_interactions","304164217_An_analytical_framework_to_nowcast_well-being_using_mobile_phone_data","282906549_Choosing_the_Right_Home_Location_Definition_Method_for_the_Given_Dataset","282869681_Using_Big_Data_to_study_the_link_between_human_mobility_and_socio-economic_development","281558593_Big_Data_as_a_Source_for_Official_Statistics","269339160_Estimating_Food_Consumption_and_Poverty_Indices_with_Mobile_Phone_Data","267449917_Dynamic_population_mapping_using_mobile_phone_data","259457328_Delineating_Geographical_Regions_with_Networks_of_Human_Interactions_in_an_Extensive_Set_of_Countries","258424433_Exploring_Universal_Patterns_in_Human_Home-Work_Commuting_from_Mobile_Phone_Data","257868398_A_planetary_nervous_system_for_social_mining_and_collective_awareness","44617573_Network_Diversity_and_Economic_Development"]}
