{"id":"286545163_Ultimacy_and_the_Philosophic_field_of_Metaphysics","abstract":"Since the inception of metaphysics with Aristotle as a delineated area of philosophic concern, it has labored under the burden of being “first” to all other philosophy. Being “first” means being fundamental in some sense. Vaguely speaking, metaphysics is considered fundamental to all other areas of philosophy by being their conceptual underpinning. Often, questions raised in one area, for instance epistemology, are directed to its own bases, and, as a result, are considered to be more fundamental than the inquiry conducted within the area itself. In the most abstract and general reaches of philosophy such questions are said to be on a metaphysical level, and since they concern bases of another area they are more fundamental than that area.","authors":["Donald S.
