{"id":"326076039_Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_Models_for_Cross-Version_Defect_Prediction","abstract":"Sorting software modules in order of defect count can help testers to focus on software modules with more defects. One of the most popular methods for sorting modules is generalized linear regression. However, our previous study showed the poor performance of these regression models, which might be caused by severe multicollinearity. Ridge regression (RR) can improve the prediction performance for multicollinearity problems. Lasso regression (LAR) is a worthy competitor to RR. Therefore, we investigate both RR and LAR models for cross-version defect prediction. Cross-version defect prediction is an approximate to real applications. It constructs prediction models from a previous version of projects and predicts defects in the next version. Experimental results based on 11 projects from the PROMISE repository consisting of 41 different versions show that: 1) there exist severe multicollinearity problems in the experimental datasets; 2) both RR and LAR models perform better than linear regression and negative binomial regression for cross-version defect prediction; and 3) compared with two best methods in our previous study for sorting software modules according to the predicted number of defects, RR has comparable performance and less model construction time.
