{"id":"236271662_On_the_complexity_of_the_selective_graph_coloring_problem_in_some_special_classes_of_graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the selective graph coloring problem. Given an integer k >= 1 and a\ngraph G = (V;E) with a partition V1; : : : ; Vp of V , it consists in deciding whether there exists a\nset V^*  in G such that |V  \\cap Vi| = 1 for all i \\in {1; : : : ; p}, and such that the graph induced by V^* \nis k-colorable. We investigate the complexity status of this problem in various classes of graphs.","authors":["Marc Demange","Jérôme Monnot","Petrica C.
