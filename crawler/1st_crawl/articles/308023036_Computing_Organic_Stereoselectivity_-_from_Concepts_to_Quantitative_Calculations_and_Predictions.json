{"id":"308023036_Computing_Organic_Stereoselectivity_-_from_Concepts_to_Quantitative_Calculations_and_Predictions","abstract":"Advances in theory and processing power have established computation as a valuable interpretative and predictive tool in the discovery of new asymmetric catalysts. This tutorial review outlines the theory and practice of modeling stereoselective reactions. Recent examples illustrate how an understanding of the fundamental principles and the application of state-of-the-art computational methods may be used to gain mechanistic insight into organic and organometallic reactions. We highlight the emerging potential of this computational tool-box in providing meaningful predictions for the rational design of asymmetric catalysts. We present an accessible account of the field to encourage future synergy between computation and experiment.","authors":["Qian Peng","Fernanda Duarte","Robert Paton"],"meta":["September 2016Chemical Society Reviews 45(22)","DOI:10.1039/C6CS00573J","Project: computational asymmetric catalysis"],"references":["296477001_Dynamic_behavior_of_rearranging_carbocations_-_Implications_for_terpene_biosynthesis","289502095_Computational_ligand_design_in_enantio-_and_diastereoselective_ynamide_52_cycloisomerization","272266368_The_Houk-List_transition_states_for_organocatalytic_mechanisms_revisited","260152105_Dissecting_non-covalent_interactions_in_oxazaborolidinium_catalyzed_cycloadditions_of_maleimides","258822692_How_much_do_van_der_Waals_dispersion_forces_contribute_to_molecular_recognition_in_solution","245028589_C-HO_Non-classical_Hydrogen_Bonding_in_the_Stereomechanics_of_Organic_Transformations_Theory_and_Recognition","225805102_The_M06_suite_of_density_functionals_for_main_group_thermochemistry_thermochemical_kinetics_noncovalent_interactions_excited_states_and_transition_elements_two_new_functionals_and_systematic_testing_o","47545698_How_reliable_are_DFT_transition_structures_Comparison_of_GGA_hybrid-meta-GGA_and_meta-GGA_functionals","301737280_A_Practical_Guide_for_Predicting_the_Stereochemistry_of_Bifunctional_Phosphoric_Acid_Catalyzed_Reactions_of_Imines","301217753_Prediction_of_Stereochemistry_Using_Q2MM","299396020_The_Study_of_Reactive_Intermediates_in_Condensed_Phases","297893525_Theory_and_Modeling_of_Asymmetric_Catalytic_Reactions","296469378_Development_of_a_True_Transition_State_Force_Field_TTSFF_from_Quantum_Mechanical_Calculations","272890718_ChemInform_Abstract_Enantioselective_Desymmetrization_of_Prochiral_Cyclohexanones_by_Organocatalytic_Intramolecular_Michael_Additions_to_ab-Unsaturated_Esters","271597963_Origins_of_Stereoselectivity_in_Intramolecular_Aldol_Reactions_Catalyzed_by_Cinchona_Amines","270654341_ChemInform_Abstract_Computational_Organic_Chemistry_Bridging_Theory_and_Experiment_in_Establishing_the_Mechanisms_of_Chemical_Reactions","262538769_Computational_Ligand_Design_for_the_Reductive_Elimination_of_ArCF3_from_a_Small_Bite_Angle_Pd-II_Complex_Remarkable_Effect_of_a_Perfluoroalkyl_Phosphine","262381855_Dispersion-correcting_potentials_can_significantly_improve_the_bond_dissociation_enthalpies_and_noncovalent_binding_energies_predicted_by_density-functional_theory","261569456_Computational_Kinetics_of_Cobalt-Catalyzed_Alkene_Hydroformylation","244234266_On_the_mechanism_of_stereoselection_in_direct_Mannich_reaction_catalyzed_by_BINOL-derived_phosphoric_acids","237527264_Computational_Approaches_to_Asymmetric_Synthesis","233422254_Why_the_Standard_B3LYP6-31GModel_Chemistry_Should_Not_Be_Used_in_DFT_Calculations_of_Molecular_Thermochemistry_Understanding_and_Correcting_the_Problem","231533254_Proline-Catalyzed_Direct_Asymmetric_Aldol_Reactions","231247794_Assessment_of_Popular_DFT_and_Semiempirical_Molecular_Orbital_Techniques_for_Calculating_Relative_Transition_State_Energies_and_Kinetic_Product_Distributions_in_Enantioselective_Organocatalytic_Reacti","230565474_Silver-Catalysed_Enantioselective_Addition_of_OH_and_NH_Bonds_to_Allenes_A_New_Model_for_Stereoselectivity_Based_on_Noncovalent_Interactions","230564240_Aromatic_Interactions_as_Control_Elements_in_Stereoselective_Organic_Reactions","228844607_NCIPLOT_A_program_for_plotting_noncovalent_interaction_regions","224877367_Current_Status_of_Transition-State_Theory","50362032_Transition_State_Charge_Stabilization_Through_Multiple_Non-Covalent_Interactions_in_the_Guanidinium-Catalyzed_Enantioselective_Claisen_Rearrangement","24222290_Hydrogen_Bonding_and_-Stacking_How_Reliable_are_Force_Fields_A_Critical_Evaluation_of_Force_Field_Descriptions_of_Nonbonded_Interactions","23266214_The_advent_and_development_of_organocatalysis","23152138_Phosphoric_Acid_Catalyzed_Enantioselective_Transfer_Hydrogenation_of_Imines_A_Density_Functional_Theory_Study_of_Reaction_Mechanism_and_the_Origins_of_Enantioselectivity","10886228_Quantum_Mechanical_Predictions_of_the_Stereoselectivities_of_Proline-Catalyzed_Asymmetric_Intermolecular_Aldol_Reactions","8592434_Chiral_Brnsted_Acid-Catalyzed_Direct_Mannich_Reactions_via_Electrophilic_Activation","7251152_Do_the_Terms_ee_and_de_Make_Sense_as_Expressions_of_Stereoisomer_Composition_or_Stereoselectivity","5269214_Enantioselective_Mannich-Type_Reaction_Catalyzed_by_a_Chiral_Brnsted_Acid"]}
