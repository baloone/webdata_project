{"id":"312483915_Model-Driven_Engineering_for_Mission-Critical_IoT_Systems","abstract":"Mission-critical Internet of Things (MC-IoT) systems involve heterogeneous things from both the digital and physical worlds. They run applications whose failure might cause significant and possibly dramatic consequences, such as interruption of public services, significant business losses, and deterioration of enterprise operations. These applications require not only high availability, reliability, safety, and security but also regulatory compliance, scalability, and serviceability. At the same time, they're exposed to various facets of uncertainty, spanning from software and hardware variability to mission planning and execution in possibly unforeseeable environments. Model-driven engineering can potentially meet these challenges and better enable the adoption of MC-IoT systems.","authors":["Federico Ciccozzi","Ivica Crnkovic","Davide Di Ruscio","Ivano Malavolta"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Software 34(1):46-53","DOI:10.1109/MS.2017.1","Projects: FLYAQ - Enabling Non-Expert Users to Program Missions of Autonomous MulticoptersMOMENTUM: analysis of fUML and ALF for optimised model compilation"],"references":["282822508_Enabling_high-level_application_development_for_the_internet_of_things","281352752_Weaving_Concurrency_in_eXecutable_Domain-Specific_Modeling_Languages","260541297_IoT_Reference_Model","347983323_Weaving_concurrency_in_executable_domain-specific_modeling_languages","321572367_Modelsruntime_Foundations_Applications_and_Roadmaps","309222348_Leveraging_Collective_Run-Time_Adaptation_for_UAV-Based_Systems","309201475_Modelsruntime_dagstuhl_seminar_11481","303393587_Enhancing_Dependability_of_Cloud-Based_IoT_Services_through_Virtualization","301888287_That_'Internet_of_Things'_Thing","301307218_Toward_Building_a_Safe_Secure_and_Easy-to-Use_Internet_of_Things_Infrastructure"]}
