{"id":"279411424_Contagion","abstract":"Each player in an infinite population interacts strategically with a finite subset of that population. Suppose each player's\nbinary choice in each period is a best response to the population choices of the previous period. When can behaviour that\nis initially played by only a finite set of players spread to the whole population? This paper characterizes when such contagion\nis possible for arbitrary local interaction systems. Maximal contagion occurs when local interaction is sufficiently uniform and there is low neighbour growth, i.e. the number of players who can be reached in k steps does not grow exponentially in k.","authors":["Stephen Morris"],"meta":["January 2000Review of Economic Studies 67(1):57-78","DOI:10.1111/1467-937X.00121"],"references":["228702826_Proximity_of_Information_in_Games_with_Incomplete_Information","222442330_Approximating_Common_Knowledge_With_Common_Beliefs","4821349_The_Robustness_of_Equilibria_to_Incomplete_Information","223304559_Costs_of_flexibility_and_equilibrium_selection","222864739_Evolution_interaction_and_Nash_equilibria","200775200_Communication_and_Coordination_in_Social_Networks","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","4971522_The_Coexistence_of_Conventions","4952057_How_Much_Common_Belief_Is_Necessary_for_a_Convention","4898592_Dominance_and_Belief_Potential","4898504_Learning_Local_Interaction_and_Coordination","4898442_Learning_Mutation_And_Long_Run_Equilibria_In_Games","4878119_The_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Best-Response_Strategy_Revision","4783364_Noisy_Contagion_Without_Mutation","4783361_Basins_of_Attraction_Long-Run_Stochastic_Stability_and_the_Speed_of_Step-by-Step_Evolution","4765249_Path_Dependence_and_Learning_from_Neighbors"]}
