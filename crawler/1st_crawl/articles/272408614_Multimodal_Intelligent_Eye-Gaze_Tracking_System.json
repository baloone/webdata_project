{"id":"272408614_Multimodal_Intelligent_Eye-Gaze_Tracking_System","abstract":"This paper presents a series of user studies to develop a new eye gaze tracking based pointing system. We developed a new target prediction model that works for different input modalities and combined the eye gaze tracking based pointing with a joystick controller that can reduce pointing and selection times. The system finds important applications in cockpit of combat aircraft as well as for computer novice users. Our user studies confirmed that users can perform significantly faster using this new eye gaze tracking based system for both military and everyday computing tasks compared to existing input devices. As part of the study we also found that the amplitude of maximum power component obtained through Fourier Transform of pupil signal significantly correlate with selection times and perceived cognitive load of users in terms of TLX scores.","authors":["Pradipta Biswas","Pat Langdon"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction 31(4):150203052917007","DOI:10.1080/10447318.2014.1001301"],"references":["336576040_Modelling_perception_using_image_processing_algorithms","288650470_An_HCI_survey_on_elderly_users_in_India","318039469_Eye_Tracking_Methodology","316823497_Inclusive_Human_Machine_Interaction_for_India","314824198_Application_of_Fitts'_law_to_eye_gaze_interaction","289924063_Application_of_inclusive_user_modelling_web_service","277428331_Fitts'_law_and_expanding_targets","266656012_Multimodal_target_prediction_model","266655728_Mouse_pointing_endpoint_prediction_using_kinematic_template_matching","266655032_Eyeboard_an_enhanced_eye_gaze-based_text_entry_system_in_Hindi"]}
