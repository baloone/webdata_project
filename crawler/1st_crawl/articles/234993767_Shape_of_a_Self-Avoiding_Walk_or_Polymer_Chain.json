{"id":"234993767_Shape_of_a_Self-Avoiding_Walk_or_Polymer_Chain","abstract":"If pn (r) is the probability density of self-avoiding walks of m steps which reach the point r it is proved rigorously that the generating function ∞ P(θ, r) = ∑ pn(r) exp(-nθ) n=1 decays exponentially with r. This result is used to derive restrictions on the form of the distribution pn(r). In particular it is argued that if, for large n the distribution in d dimensions approaches a limiting shape, R n-dF(r/Rn), where the scaling length R n, which measures the mean end-to-end distance, varies as W, then the shape factor has the form F(y)=A(y) exp(-yδ), where δ= 1/(1-v) and where A (y) does not vary exponentially fast for large y. Accepting the values v2=3/4 and v3=3/5 for d=2 and 3, as suggested originally by Flory and since supported by numerical and theoretical calculations, yields δ2=4 and δ3 = 2 1/2 so that F(y) has the form conjectured recently by Domb et al. on the basis of the numerical analysis of finite lattice chains.","authors":["Michael E.
