{"id":"334720515_Forwarding_stabilization_in_discrete_time","abstract":"The paper deals with stabilization of discrete-time cascade dynamics. The notion of average passivity is used to achieve stability through an\niterative design procedure for feedforward cascaded connections. Academic simulated examples illustrate the performances and compare\nthe proposed solution with the one available in the literature.","authors":["M.
