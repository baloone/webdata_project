{"id":"325190436_Big_Data_Analytics_Machine_Learning_and_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Next-Generation_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"The next-generation wireless networks are evolv- ing into very complex systems because of the very diversified service requirements, heterogeneity in applications, devices, and networks. The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks regarding operation and optimization cost-effectively. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self- adaptive and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelli- gent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of machine learning, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, self- adaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are presented concerning data analytics. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and benefits of adopting big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in the next-generation communication systems.","authors":["Mirza Kibria","Kien Nguyen","Gabriel Villardi","Ou Zhao"],"meta":["May 2018IEEE Access PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2837692"],"references":["312093800_Machine_Learning_Paradigms_for_Next-Generation_Wireless_Networks","281312728_Wireless_Communications_in_the_Era_of_Big_Data","321440701_The_Big-Data-Driven_Intelligent_Wireless_Network_Architecture_Use_Cases_Solutions_and_Future_Trends","320175514_An_Introduction_to_Deep_Learning_for_the_Physical_Layer","318576730_Big_Data_Enabled_Mobile_Network_Design_for_5G_and_Beyond","317487840_Mobile_Big_Data_The_Fuel_for_Data-Driven_Wireless","317395142_Multi-Beam_Antenna_Technologies_for_5G_Wireless_Communications","315908735_Survey_of_wireless_big_data","313450607_Fair_Robust_Predictive_Resource_Allocation_for_Video_Streaming_under_Rate_Uncertainties","312668677_Exploiting_Mobile_Big_Data_Sources_Features_and_Applications"]}
