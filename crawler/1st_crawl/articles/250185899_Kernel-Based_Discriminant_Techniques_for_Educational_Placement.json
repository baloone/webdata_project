{"id":"250185899_Kernel-Based_Discriminant_Techniques_for_Educational_Placement","abstract":"This article considers the problem of educational placement. Several discriminant techniques are applied to a data set from a survey project of science ability. A profile vector for each student consists of five science-educational indictors. The students are intended to be placed into three reference groups: advanced, regular, and remedial. Various discriminant techniques, including Fisher’s discriminant analysis and kernel-based nonparametric discriminant analysis, are compared. The evaluation work is based on the leaving-one-out misclassification score. Results from the five school data sets and 500 bootstrap samples reveal that the kernel-based nonparametric approach with bandwidth selected by cross validation performs reasonably well. The authors regard kernel-based nonparametric procedures as desirable competitors to Fisher’s discriminant rule for handling problems of educational placement.","authors":["Miao-hsiang Lin","Su-Yun Huang","Yuan-chin Chang"],"meta":["June 2004Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics 29(2):219-240","DOI:10.3102/10769986029002219"],"references":["258135728_Instructional_Program_Coherence_What_It_Is_and_Why_It_Should_Guide_School_Improvement_Policy","234682443_Indicators_of_Science_Achievement_Options_for_a_Powerful_Policy_Instrument","38358197_The_Strong_Uniform_Consistency_of_Nearest_Neighbor_Density_Estimates","261805714_Comparison_of_Discrimination_Techniques_Applied_to_a_Complex_Data_Set_of_Head_Injured_Patients","259970293_Estimation_of_Error_Rates_in_Several_Population_Discriminant_Analysis","224817362_On_the_Smoothing_of_Probability_Density_Functions","224817268_Non-Parametric_Estimation_of_a_Multivariate_Probability_Density","223158382_Multivariate_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Density_Estimates","38367114_Remarks_on_Some_Non-Parametric_Estimates_of_a_Density_Function","38359192_An_Asymptotically_Optimal_Window_Selection_Rule_for_Kernel_Density_Estimates","38358892_Optimal_Global_Rates_of_Convergence_for_Nonparametric_Regression","38358533_Unbiasedness_of_the_Likelihood_Ratio_Tests_for_Equality_of_Several_Covariance_Matrices_and_Equality_of_Several_Multivariate_Normal_Populations","38358153_Consistency_Properties_of_Nearest_Neighbor_Density_Function_Estimators"]}
