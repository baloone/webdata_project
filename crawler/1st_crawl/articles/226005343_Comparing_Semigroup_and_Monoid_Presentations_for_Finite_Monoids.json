{"id":"226005343_Comparing_Semigroup_and_Monoid_Presentations_for_Finite_Monoids","abstract":" It is known that for any finite group G given by a finite group presentation there exists a finite semigroup presentation for G of the same deficiency, i.e. satisfying . It is also known that the analogous statement does not hold for all finite monoids. In this paper we give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a finite monoid M, given by a finite monoid presentation, to have a finite semigroup presentation of the same deficiency.","authors":["Colin Campbell","James David Mitchell","N.
