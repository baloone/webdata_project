{"id":"340491247_COVID-19_and_the_Heart","abstract":"Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus produces a clinical syndrome known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When severe, COVID-19 is a systemic illness characterized by hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, and elevations of cardiac injury biomarkers. Here, we review what is known about the pathophysiology of COVID-19, its cardiovascular manifestations, and emerging therapeutic prospects. In this rapidly moving field, this review was comprehensive as of April 3, 2020.","authors":["Akbarshakh Akhmerov","Eduardo Marban"],"meta":["April 2020Circulation Research
