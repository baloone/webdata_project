{"id":"265366403_On_Smoothness_Characterized_by_Bernstein_Type_Operators","abstract":"We characterize the higher orders of smoothness of functions in C[0, 1] by Bernstein polynomials and Kantorovich operators. This task is carried out by means of the rate of convergence for combinations of these operators and the behavior of their derivatives.","authors":["Ding-Xuan Zhou"],"meta":["June 1995Journal of Approximation Theory 81(3)","DOI:10.1006/jath.1995.1052"],"references":["265458303_Linear_Combinations_of_Bernstein_Polynomials","246535294_Inverse_Theorems_for_Bernstein_Polynomials","245584022_Bernstein_type_operators_and_their_derivatives","242815967_Lp-saturation_of_some_modified_Bernstein_operators","242815939_On_a_conjecture_of_Z_Ditzian","242815189_A_global_inverse_theorem_for_combinations_of_Bernstein_polynomials","242815174_The_Lp-saturation_of_the_Bernstein-Kantorovitch_polynomials","234809671_Rate_of_convergence_for_Bernstein_polynomials_revisited","226871430_Lp-approximation_by_Kantorovic_operators","226709309_Approximation_by_Meyer-Knig_and_Zeller_type_operators","225971366_A_Global_Approximation_Theorem_for_Meyer-Knig_and_Zeller_operators"]}
