The aim of this paper is to present basic concepts of digital humanities as they relate to music and musicology, as well as the term digital musicology, in order to encourage in Croatia a greater use of the new possibilities of research provided by this fi eld. Based on A Companion to Digital Humanities (chapter Music by I. Fujinaga and S. Forscher Weiss), this overview includes the following subjects: Notation software and optical music recognition (OMR); MIDI and MP3 as technical standards; databases; computer applications for music scholars; and music information retrieval (MIR) systems. For each subject, some basic sources and materials are off ered and some (more or less) current activities and projects are presented, with special consideration of Croatian perspectives.","authors":["Lucija Konfic"],"meta":["January 2017Arti Musices 2(2):227-239","DOI:10.21857/ypn4oc8039"],"references":["2352627_Modern_Information_Retrieval","344952807_Vinko_Jelic_and_Ivan_Lukacic_Two_Migrants_Between_the_Mediterranean_and_Central_Europe_in_the_MusMig_Project_and_Its_Database"]}
