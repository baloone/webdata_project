{"id":"220591893_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Relationships_among_End-User_Information_Systems_Acceptance_Training_and_Effectiveness","abstract":"With the advent of powerful microcomputers and software, end-user computing has become an important competitive weapon for organizations. However, little is known about what factors should be considered in designing end-user training programs. This empirical study investigates the factors that are essential for successful end-user training. The study results indicate both the importance of end-user information system (IS) acceptance and the strong relationships among end-user IS acceptance, end-user IS satisfaction, and end-user job satisfaction.","authors":["Sang Lee","Yeong R.
