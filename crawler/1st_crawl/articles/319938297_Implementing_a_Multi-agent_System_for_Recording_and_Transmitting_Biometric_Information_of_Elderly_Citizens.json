{"id":"319938297_Implementing_a_Multi-agent_System_for_Recording_and_Transmitting_Biometric_Information_of_Elderly_Citizens","abstract":"Canada and many other developed nations around the world are facing a growing population of elderly citizens. As a result, the economic and resource cost associated with providing high quality healthcare will increase as the population of elderly citizens grows. The primary objective of this paper is to present the architecture and prototype implementation of a Multi-Agent System designed to facilitate healthcare for elderly citizens. A Computer Science perspective is applied to theoretical research conducted on the subject of Multi-Agent Systems in healthcare. A prototype application to monitor and disseminate health information about patients to healthcare professionals is developed and presented. We focus on the implementation specifics of the proposed system and presented prototype application. Future work and open issues with this research are discussed.","authors":["Malcolm Reid","Elhadi M.
