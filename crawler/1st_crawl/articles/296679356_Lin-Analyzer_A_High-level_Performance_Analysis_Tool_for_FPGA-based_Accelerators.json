{"id":"296679356_Lin-Analyzer_A_High-level_Performance_Analysis_Tool_for_FPGA-based_Accelerators","abstract":"The increasing complexity of FPGA-based accelerators, coupled with time-to-market pressure, makes high-level synthesis (HLS) an attractive solution to improve designer productivity by abstracting the programming effort above register-transfer level (RTL). HLS offers various architectural design options with different trade-offs via pragmas (loop unrolling, loop pipelining, array partitioning). However, non-negligible HLS runtime renders manual or automated HLS-based exhaustive architectural exploration practically infeasible. To address this challenge, we present Lin-Analyzer, a high-level accurate performance analysis tool that enables rapid design space exploration with various pragmas for FPGA-based accelerators without requiring RTL implementations.","authors":["Guanwen Zhong","Alok Prakash","Yun Liang","Tulika Mitra"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2897937.2898040","Conference: The 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference 2016, DAC '16."],"references":["265380606_Design_Space_Exploration_of_Multiple_Loops_on_FPGAs_using_High_Level_Synthesis","254461080_Divide_and_Conquer_High-Level_Synthesis_Design_Space_Exploration","221224896_LegUp_High-level_synthesis_for_FPGA-based_processoraccelerator_systems","314816114_A_compiler_approach_to_fast_hardware_design_space_exploration_in_FPGA-based_systems","301368036_Resource-Aware_Throughput_Optimization_for_High-Level_Synthesis","300717577_Exploiting_Loop-Array_Dependencies_to_Accelerate_the_Design_Space_Exploration_with_High_Level_Synthesis","277295015_An_Implementation_of_Swing_Modulo_Scheduling_with_Extensions_for_Superblocks","271455545_Aladdin_A_pre-RTL_power-performance_accelerator_simulator_enabling_large_design_space_exploration_of_customized_architectures","261851821_A_Fast_and_Autonomous_HLS_Methodology_for_Hardware_Accelerator_Generation_Under_Resource_Constraints","261204393_On_learning-based_methods_for_design-space_exploration_with_High-Level_Synthesis"]}
