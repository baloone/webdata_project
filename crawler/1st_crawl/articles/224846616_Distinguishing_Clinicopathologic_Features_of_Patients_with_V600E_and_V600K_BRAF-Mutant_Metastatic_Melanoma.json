{"id":"224846616_Distinguishing_Clinicopathologic_Features_of_Patients_with_V600E_and_V600K_BRAF-Mutant_Metastatic_Melanoma","abstract":"Certain clinicopathologic features correlate with BRAF mutation status in melanoma including younger age and primary subtype. This study sought to determine the BRAF mutation status by age-decade and whether BRAF-mutant genotypes correlated with clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma. Methods: A prospectively assembled cohort of Australian patients were followed from diagnosis of metastatic melanoma (N = 308). Clinicopathologic variables were correlated with BRAF mutational status, genotype, and survival.\nForty-six percent of patients had a BRAF mutation; 73% V600E, 19% V600K, and 8% other genotypes. An inverse relationship existed between BRAF mutation prevalence and age-decade (P < 0.001). All patients <30 years and only 25% ≥ 70 years had BRAF-mutant melanoma. Amongst BRAF-mutant melanoma, the frequency of non-V600E genotypes (including V600K) increased with increasing age. Non-V600E genotypes comprised <20% in patients <50 years and >40% in those ≥ 70 years. A higher degree of cumulative sun-induced damage correlated with V600K but not V600E melanoma (P = 0.002). The disease-free interval from diagnosis of primary melanoma to first distant metastasis was shorter for patients with V600K compared with V600E melanoma (17.4 vs. 39.2 months, P = 0.048), with no difference in survival thereafter. In patients BRAF tested at diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, one year survival from diagnosis of metastasis was significantly longer for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with an inhibitor (83%), than those not treated with an inhibitor (29%, P < 0.001), or patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma (37%, P < 0.001).\nDifferent genotypes exist within BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma, representing biologically and clinically discrete subtypes, suggesting distinct etiology and behavior.","authors":["Alexander Menzies","Lauren E Haydu","Lydia Visintin","Matteo S Carlino"],"meta":["April 2012Clinical Cancer Research 18(12):3242-9","DOI:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0052","SourcePubMed"],"references":["323034128_P-02_NRAS_and_BRAF_mutations_in_melanoma_tumours_in_relation_to_clinical_characteristics_a_study_based_on_mutation_screening_by_pyrosequencing","313956424_The_impact_of_multiple_primary_cutaneous_melanomas_on_survival_of_2942_patients_with_metastatic_melanoma","313947692_Phase_III_study_to_assess_safety_pharmacokinetics_and_efficacy_of_the_oral_MEK_12_inhibitor_GSK1120212_GSK212_dosed_in_combination_with_the_oral_BRAF_inhibitor_GSK2118436_GSK436","295114498_PHASE_12_STUDY_OF_GSK2118436_A_SELECTIVE_INHIBITOR_OF_V600_MUTANT_MUT_BRAF_KINASE_EVIDENCE_OF_ACTIVITY_IN_MELANOMA_BRAIN_METASTASES_METS","292021092_Constitutive_activation_of_the_Ras-Raf_signaling_pathway_in_metastatic_melanoma_is_associated_with_poor_prognosis","286784353_A_Phase_II_study_of_the_MEK1MEK2_inhibitor_GSK1120212_in_metastatic_BRAFV600E_or_K_mutant_cutaneous_melanoma_patients_previously_treated_with_or_without_a_BRAF_inhibitor","285142881_Frequency_of_mutations_associated_with_targeted_therapy_in_malignant_melanoma_patients","285098203_GSK2118436_Phase_12_study_of_a_selective_inhibitor_of_V600_mutant_Braf_kinase_Evidence_of_activity_in_melanoma_brain_metastases","284931596_Phase_III_study_of_GSK2118436_a_selective_inhibitor_of_oncogenic_mutant_BRAF_kinase_in_patients_with_metastatic_melanoma_and_other_solid_tumors","284626658_Inhibition_of_mutated_activated_BRAF_in_metastasic_melanoma"]}
