{"id":"319913659_Automated_measurement_of_syntactic_complexity_in_corpus-based_L2_writing_research_and_implications_for_writing_assessment","abstract":"Research investigating corpora of English learnersâ€™ language raises new questions about how syntactic complexity is defined theoretically and operationally for second language (L2) writing assessment. I show that syntactic complexity is important in construct definitions and L2 writing rating scales as well as in L2 writing research. I describe the operationalizations of syntactic complexity measurement in corpus-based L2 writing research, focusing on the Biber Tagger (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999), Coh-Metrix (McNamara, Graesser, McCarthy, & Cai, 2014), and L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (Lu, 2010), which are three tools commonly used to automate syntactic complexity analysis. A review of findings from recent corpus-based L2 writing studies on the relationship of syntactic complexity to L2 writing quality follows. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of these multiple perspectives on the definition of syntactic complexity in L2 studies.","authors":["Xiaofei Lu"],"meta":["October 2017Language Testing 34(4):493-511","DOI:10.1177/0265532217710675","Project: Lexical and syntactic complexity: conceptualizations, measurement and applications"],"references":["323368958_The_relationship_between_L2_writing_quality_and_objective_measures_of_syntactic_and_lexical_complexity","305847090_Same_language_different_functions_A_cross-genre_analysis_of_Chinese_EFL_learners'_writing_performance","291770049_Scales_for_rating_language_performance_Descriptive_models_formulation_styles_and_presentation_formats","281131428_A_corpus-based_comparison_of_syntactic_complexity_in_NNS_and_NS_university_students'_writing","280289927_Does_writing_development_equal_writing_quality_A_computational_investigation_of_syntactic_complexity_in_L2_learners","265887417_Complexity_Accuracy_and_Fluency_in_Second_Language_Acquisition","264372709_TESOL_Quartely_What_Linguistic_Features_Are_Indicative_of_Writing_Quality_A_Case_of_Argumentative_Essays_in_a_College_Composition_Program","259823581_Task_complexity_task_difficulty_and_task_production_Exploring_interactions_in_a_componential_framework","257483763_On_the_relation_between_automated_essay_scoring_and_modern_views_of_the_writing_construct","26656402_The_components_of_paraphrase","350683457_Theory_and_Practice_of_Writing","313552930_Fast_exact_inference_with_a_factored_model_for_natural_language_parsing","302054558_The_Linguistic_Development_of_Students_of_English_as_a_Second_Language_in_Two_Written_Genres","288494375_Rating_written_performance_What_do_raters_do_and_why","286335617_Assessing_Writing","286069528_Automated_evaluation_of_text_and_discourse_with_Coh-Metrix","280257078_Exploring_multiple_profiles_of_L2_writing_using_multi-dimensional_analysis","280256988_Conceptualizing_and_measuring_short-term_changes_in_L2_writing_complexity","279070416_Syntactic_complexity_in_college-level_English_writing_Differences_among_writers_with_diverse_L1_backgrounds","277943021_A_Comparison_of_EFL_Raters'_Essay-Rating_Processes_Across_Two_Types_of_Rating_Scales","276831728_Predicting_Patterns_of_Grammatical_Complexity_Across_Language_Exam_Task_Types_and_Proficiency_Levels","275164153_Automated_Essay_Scoring_by_Capturing_Relative_Writing_Quality","273834396_Different_topics_different_discourse_Relationships_among_writing_topic_measures_of_syntactic_complexity_and_judgments_of_writing_quality","271567544_DISCOURSE_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_WRITING_AND_SPEAKING_TASK_TYPES_ON_THE_TOEFL_IBT_R_TEST_A_LEXICO-GRAMMATICAL_ANALYSIS","264821423_Understanding_expert_ratings_of_essay_quality_Coh-Metrix_analyses_of_first_and_second_language_writing","264692460_Should_We_Use_Characteristics_of_Conversation_to_Measure_Grammatical_Complexity_in_L2_Writing_Development","260354329_A_Corpus-Based_Evaluation_of_Syntactic_Complexity_Measures_as_Indices_of_College-Level_ESL_Writers'_Language_Development","251642784_Rating_scales_for_diagnostic_assessment_of_writing_What_should_they_look_like_and_where_should_the_criteria_come_from","249870330_Measuring_grammatical_complexity_The_Gordian_knot","249237888_Towards_an_Organic_Approach_to_Investigating_CAF_in_Instructed_SLA_The_Case_of_Complexity","243653192_Variation_Across_Speech_and_Writing","238410072_Syntactic_Complexity_Measures_and_their_Relationship_to_L2_Proficiency_A_Research_Synthesis_of_College-level_L2_Writing","233686598_Automatic_analysis_of_syntactic_complexity_in_second_language_writing","227510144_Decision_Making_while_Rating_ESLEFL_Writing_Tasks_A_Descriptive_Framework","31777153_Language_Testing_in_Practice_Designing_and_Developing_Useful_Language_Tests_LF_Bachman_AS_Palmer","27483374_Discourse_and_assessment","2530760_The_Longman_Grammar_of_Spoken_and_Written_English"]}
