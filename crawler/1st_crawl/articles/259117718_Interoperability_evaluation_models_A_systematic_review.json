{"id":"259117718_Interoperability_evaluation_models_A_systematic_review","abstract":"Interoperability is defined as the ability for two (or more) systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged. There is increasing demand for interoperability between individual software systems. Developing an interoperability evaluation model between software and information systems is difficult, and becoming an important challenge. An interoperability evaluation model allows knowing the degree of interoperability, and lead to the improvement of interoperability. This paper describes the existing interoperability evaluation models, and performs a comparative analysis among their findings to determine the similarities and differences in their philosophy and implementation. This analysis yields a set of recommendations for any party that is open to the idea of creating or improving an interoperability evaluation model.","authors":["Reza Rezaei","Thiam Kian Chiew","Sai Peck Lee","Zeinab Shams Aliee"],"meta":["January 2014Computers in Industry 65(1):1â€“23","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2013.09.001"],"references":["265923135_The_Interoperability_Score","255430588_Towards_Standardising_Interoperability_Levels_for_Information_Systems_of_Public_Administrations","250408767_Model_Problems_in_Technologies_for_Interoperability_Web_Services","249629153_Mrs_Miller_Moves_House_The_Interoperability_of_Local_Public_Services_in_Europe","245824858_Current_Perspectives_on_Interoperability","242487006_Measuring_System_Interoperability_An_i-Score_Improvement","237762381_Towards_the_Edge_and_Beyond_The_Role_of_Interoperability","237367408_Achieving_Enterprise_Application_Interoperability_Design_Patterns_and_Directives","237132093_System_of_Systems_Interoperability_SOSI_Final_Report","220921695_Enhancing_Application_Interoperability_and_Enabling_B2B_Transactions_over_the_Internet_for_Small_and_Medium_Enterprises_The_PRAXIS_Project","220921500_Enterprise_Interoperability_Framework","292704377_Enabling_interoperability_of_transactional_enterprise_applications","289660523_Towards_a_Scientific_Foundation_for_Interoperability","288394327_Digging_into_the_real-life_Enterprise_Interoperability_areas_definition_and_overview_of_the_main_research_areas","277664945_IEEE_Standard_Glossary_of_Software_Engineering_Terminology","267224622_Integration_and_Interoperability_Models_for_Systems_of_Systems","267222352_Interoperability_in_Digital_Public_Services_and_Administration_Bridging_E-Government_and_E-Business","265936093_Interoperability_for_Joint_and_Coalition_Operations","262254437_Systematic_Approaches_for_Designing_B2B_Applications","261452533_Measuring_medical_informatics_systems_interoperability_using_the_LISI_model","245528830_A_review_of_electronic_government_interoperability_frameworks_Patterns_and_challenges","241636054_Introduction_to_Cloud_Infrastructures_and_Interoperability_Minitrack","236851125_The_Business_Interoperability_Quotient_Measurement_Model","236591755_Infusing_Scientific_Foundations_into_Enterprise_Interoperability","235187035_Measuring_Systems_Interoperability_Challenges_and_Opportunities","235182727_Interoperability_Assessment","235127205_An_Organisational_Interoperability_Agility_Model","235013447_An_Interoperability_Road_Map_for_C4ISR_Legacy_Systems","234832022_Semantic_interoperability","229593407_The_Authoritative_Dictionary_of_IEEE_Standards_Terms","228857825_An_analysis_of_basic_interoperability_related_terms_system_of_interoperability_types","228790120_Non-technical_interoperability_The_challenge_of_command_leadership_in_multinational_operations","228595306_Organisational_Interoperability_Maturity_Model_for_C2","226807104_Enabling_Cross-Border_Interoperability_Modelling_Legal_Rules_for_Electronic_Transactions_in_the_European_Union","226665430_Object_Interoperability","226612713_ISO_Standards_for_Interoperability_a_Comparison","226321509_Developing_a_Science_Base_for_Enterprise_Interoperability","224732624_Interoperability_in_Defense_Communications","224686784_An_Interoperability_Framework_for_Pan-European_E-Government_Services_PEGS","224142297_Cloud_Computing_Issues_and_Challenges","222425197_Semantic_interoperability_in_eGovernment_initiatives","222409081_Business_to_business_interoperability_A_current_review_of_XML_data_integration_standards","222006910_Architectures_for_Enterprise_Integration_and_Interoperability_Past_Present_and_Future","221443649_Enabling_Cross-Border_Interoperability_Modelling_Legal_Rules_for_Electronic_Transactions_in_the_European_Union","221443633_Enabling_Cross-Organizational_Interoperability_A_Hybrid_e-Business_Architecture","221192191_Cloud_Computing_Issues_and_Challenges","220918046_Semantic_Interoperability_for_e-Business_in_the_ISP_Service_Domain","220724244_Social_Semantic_Web_at_Work_Annotating_and_Grouping_Social_Media_Content","220688931_Web_Services_Principles_and_Technology","220609766_An_evaluation_and_selection_framework_for_interoperability_standards","220457382_An_Interoperability_Approach_to_System_Software_Tools_and_Libraries_for_Clusters","44938666_Towards_an_Excellence_Framework_for_Business_Interoperability","220594383_Towards_a_Systemic_Formalisation_of_Interoperability","216841546_System_of_Systems_Interoperability_Types_and_Characteristics_in_Joint_Command_and_Control","200827675_IT_Architectures_and_Middleware_Strategies_for_Building_Large_Integrated_Systems"]}
