{"id":"321018091_Evaluation_of_bioinspired_algorithms_for_the_solution_of_the_job_scheduling_problem","abstract":"In this research we used bio-inspired metaheuristics, as artificial immune systems and\nant colony algorithms that are based on a number of characteristics and behaviors of living\nthings that are interesting in the computer science area. This paper presents an evaluation of\nbio-inspired solutions to combinatorial optimization problem, called the Job Shop\nScheduling or planning work, in a simple way the objective is to find a configuration or job\nstream that has the least amount of time to be executed in machine settings. The\nperformance of the algorithms was characterized and evaluated for reference instances of\nthe job shop scheduling problem, comparing the quality of the solutions obtained with\nrespect to the best known solution of the most effective methods. The solutions were\nevaluated in two aspects, first in relation of quality of solutions, taking as reference the\nmakespan and secondly in relation of performance, taking the number evaluations\nperformed by the algorithm to obtain the best solution.","authors":["Wilfredo Ariel Gómez Bueno","Edson Flórez","Nelson Diaz","Lola Bautista"],"meta":["November 2017"],"references":["273441805_Algoritmo_Inmune_de_Seleccion_Clonal_para_el_problema_de_Job_Shop_Scheduling","256846085_An_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_for_job_shop_scheduling_problem","236017370_Algoritmo_Basado_en_Una_Red_Inmune_Artificial_para_La_Alineacion_de_Patrones_de_Puntos","278665330_Job_Shop_Scheduling_using_the_Clonal_Selection_Principle","267413313_OAT_HowTo_High-Level_Domain_Problem_and_Algorithm_Implementation","243704096_Meta-heuristics_Combined_with_Branch_Bound","239660128_Supplement_to_Resource_Constrained_Project_Scheduling_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_Heuristic_Scheduling_Techniques","238838171_The_Clonal_Selection_Algorithm_with_Engineering_Applications_1","238691740_The_Complexity_of_Flowshop_and_Jobshop_Scheduling","228795617_Ant_colony_optimization_for_job_shop_scheduling_problem","228776617_Un_algoritmo_voraz_para_resolver_el_problema_de_la_programacion_de_tareas_dependientes_en_maquinas_diferentes","226469800_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedures_Advances_Hybridizations_and_Applications","221900771_Metaheuristics_in_Combinatorial_Optimization_Overview_and_Conceptual_Comparison","221506597_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Indic_Script_Using_Clonal_Selection_Algorithm","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
