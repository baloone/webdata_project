It seems both sensible and necessary to expand the conventional school curriculum to include the systematic implementation of Computational Thinking (CT), i. e. solving problems or tasks with the help of algorithmic solution strategies, drawing on fundamental computer science concepts (Wing 2006, 33). This has already been implemented in many countries worldwide (Bocconi et al. 2016). Professionalization of teachers is considered particularly important for successful implementation (Pollak and Ebner 2019). In the Austrian province of Burgenland, an integrative curriculum has been implemented to promote CT for the primary level, and the elective subject Coding and Robotics has been introduced for secondary level 1 (Leitgeb 2019). In order to provide further training for teachers, a two-year university course in Coding and Robotics has been developed and implemented at the Burgenland University of Education. This paper presents the theoretical framework, background and conception, the contentual and didactic design and the goals of the course, together with results of an evaluation conducted after the first year of study.","authors":["Thomas Leitgeb","Alexander Zimmermann","Wolfram Rollett"],"meta":["April 2021MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung 42(Optimierung):17","DOI:10.21240/mpaed/42/2021.04.29.X","Project: Educational Computational Thinking  \"Vom Greifen zum Begreifen\""],"references":["341469204_Computational_Thinking_Is_More_about_Thinking_than_Computing","339473617_Ein_gelungener_Ubergang_von_der_Primarstufe_in_die_Sekundarstufe_I_-_die_VS_und_MS_St_Michael_zeigen_es_vor","337963535_The_Missing_Link_to_Computational_Thinking","336982988_Coding_und_Robotik_fur_alle","332122595_Robotics_to_develop_computational_thinking_in_early_Childhood_Education","327302966_Computational_thinking_-_a_guide_for_teachers","326640787_Towards_a_Formal_Definition_of_Educational_Robotics","324497912_Publication_Trends_Over_10_Years_of_Computational_Thinking_Research","328527684_The_Cognitive_Benefits_of_Learning_Computer_Programming_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Transfer_Effects","322179197_Robotics-Based_Learning_Interventions_and_Experiences_From_our_Implementations_in_the_RobESL_Framework","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","312039564_Developing_Computational_Thinking_in_Compulsory_Education_Implications_for_policy_and_practice","305140678_A_K-6_Computational_Thinking_Curriculum_Framework_Implications_for_Teacher_Knowledge","301525438_Teachers'_perspectives_on_successful_strategies_for_teaching_Computing_in_school","286627370_Recht_Technik_Roboter"]}
