{"id":"317949713_Separating_Time-Frequency_Sources_from_Time-Domain_Convolutive_Mixtures_Using_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of under-determined audio source separation in multichannel reverberant mixtures. We target a semi- blind scenario assuming that the mixing filters are known. Source separation is performed from the time-domain mixture signals in order to accurately model the convolutive mixing process. The source signals are however modeled as latent variables in a time-frequency domain. In a previous paper we proposed to use the modified discrete cosine transform. The present paper generalizes the method to the use of the odd-frequency short-time Fourier transform. In this domain, the source coefficients are modeled as centered complex Gaussian random variables whose variances are structured by means of a non-negative matrix factorization model. The inference procedure relies on a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. In the experiments we discuss the choice of the source representation and we show that the proposed approach outperforms two methods from the literature.","authors":["Simon Leglaive","Roland Badeau","GaÃ«l Richard"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170036","Conference: WASPAA 2017At: New Paltz, New York, USA"],"references":["311617537_Multichannel_audio_source_separation_Variational_inference_of_time-frequency_sources_from_time-domain_observations","308399966_Multichannel_Audio_Source_Separation_With_Probabilistic_Reverberation_Priors","281657427_Alpha-Stable_Matrix_Factorization","280047188_Cauchy_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","267917604_Probabilistic_Modeling_Paradigms_for_Audio_Source_Separation","317725190_Audio_source_separation_based_on_convolutive_transfer_function_and_frequency-domain_lasso_optimization","304361019_Student's_T_nonnegative_matrix_factorization_and_positive_semidefinite_tensor_factorization_for_single-channel_audio_source_separation","281886469_Low-Rank_Time-Frequency_Synthesis","281075767_Sparse_Component_Analysis","280940018_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning"]}
