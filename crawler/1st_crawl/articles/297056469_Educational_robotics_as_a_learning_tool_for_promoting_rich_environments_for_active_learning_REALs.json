However, current educational practice in schools seems to be moving away from helping to educate our future innovative and creative workforce. With the extensive focus on assessments through standardized testing, the concern is raised that more and more teachers are forced to teach to the test. In this chapter, educational robotics is introduced as a transformational tool for learning, which promotes learning of computational thinking, coding, and engineering, all increasingly being viewed as critical ingredients of STEM learning in K-12 education. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the importance of integrating educational robotics as a technological learning tool into K-12 curriculum to promote Rich Environments for Active Learning (REALs) to prepare students for the technology-driven future.","authors":["Amy Eguchi"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-8363-1.ch002"],"references":["226927353_Developing_Climbing_Robots_for_Education","29811997_Rich_environments_for_active_learning_in_action_Problem-based_learning","4077094_Formal_measures_of_learning_in_a_secondary_school_mobile_robotics_course","274045249_Critical_Exploration_in_the_Classroom","3981464_Using_FIRST_LEGO_League_to_enhance_engineering_education_and_to_increase_the_pool_of_future_engineering_students_work_in_progress"]}
