{"id":"242503194_Stochastic_R0_Matrix_Linear_Complementarity_Problems","abstract":"We consider the expected residual minimization formulation of the stochastic $R_0$ matrix linear complementarity problem. We show that the involved matrix being a stochastic $R_0$ matrix is a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution set of the expected residual minimization problem to be nonempty and bounded. Moreover, local and global error bounds are given for the stochastic $R_0$ matrix linear complementarity problem. A stochastic approximation method with acceleration by averaging is applied to solve the expected residual minimization problem. Numerical examples and applications of traffic equilibrium and system control are given.","authors":["Haitao Fang","Xiaojun Chen","Masao Fukushima"],"meta":["May 2007SIAM Journal on Optimization 18(2):482-506","DOI:10.1137/050630805"],"references":["246989637_On_Homotopy-Smoothing_Methods_for_Box-Constrained_Variational_Inequalities","278524530_Error_bounds_in_mathematical_programming","269902039_The_Linear_Complementarity_Problem","248146352_Traffic_equilibrium_and_variational_inequality","245077717_A_special_Newton-type_optimization_method","244462245_Finite-Dimensional_Variational_Inequalities_and_Complementarity_Problems-Volume_I","243787416_Stochastic_Approximation_and_Its_Applications","242933045_Traffic_Equilibria_and_Variational_Inequalities","238877249_Error_Bounds_for_Piecewise_Convex_Quadratic_Programs_and_Applications","236736848_Real_analysis_Modern_techniques_and_their_applications_2nd_ed"]}
