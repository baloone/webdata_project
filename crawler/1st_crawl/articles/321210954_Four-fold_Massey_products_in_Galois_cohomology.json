{"id":"321210954_Four-fold_Massey_products_in_Galois_cohomology","abstract":"We study the vanishing of four-fold Massey products in mod p Galois cohomology. First, we describe a sufficient condition, which is simply expressed by the vanishing of some cup-products, in direct analogy with the work of Guillot, Min\\'a\\v{c} and Topaz for p=2. For local fields with enough roots of unity, we prove that this sufficient condition is also necessary, and we ask whether this is a general fact. We provide a simple splitting variety, that is, a variety which has a rational point if and only if our sufficient condition is satisfied. It has rational points over local fields, and so, if it satisfies a local-global principle, then the Massey Vanishing conjecture holds for number fields with enough roots of unity. At the heart of the paper is the construction of a finite group $\\tilde U_5(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, which has $U_5(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ as a quotient. Here $U_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is the group of $n\\times n$-matrices with entries in the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ with p elements, which are upper triangular with 1's on the diagonal. It is classical that $U_{n+1}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is intimately related to n-fold Massey products. Although $\\tilde U_5(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is much larger than $U_5(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, its definition is very natural, and perhaps surprisingly, it is easier to study.","authors":["Pierre Guillot","Jan Minac"],"meta":["November 2017Compositio Mathematica 154(09)","DOI:10.1112/S0010437X18007297","Project: Massey products in Galois cohomology and structure of maximal pro-p quotients of Absolute Galois groups"],"references":["313268073_Counting_Galois_U4Fp-extensions_using_Massey_products","269997990_Triple_Massey_products_and_absolute_Galois_groups","269997749_Triple_Massey_products_vanish_over_all_fields","266396637_Vanishing_of_Massey_Products_and_Brauer_Groups","265337508_On_the_fibration_method_for_zero-cycles_and_rational_points","260909552_Triple_Massey_products_over_global_fields","251876269_Triple_Massey_products_and_Galois_theory","243111357_Hasse_principle_and_weak_approximation_for_pencils_of_Severi-Brauer_and_similar_varieties","35812091_Witt_Rings_and_Galois_Groups","2126838_Automatic_realizations_of_Galois_groups_with_cyclic_quotient_of_order_pn","1774437_On_the_descending_central_sequence_of_absolute_Galois_groups","1733430_On_motivic_cohomology_with_Zl_coefficients","321609934_Algebraic_Number_Theory","312821032_On_3-Nilpotent_Obstructions_to_p1_Sections_for_mathbbP1_mathbbQ-01_infty","270593922_Construction_of_unipotent_Galois_extensions_and_Massey_products","267665044_Cohomology_of_Number_Fields","265948585_The_arithmetic_of_rational_varieties","259220317_The_kernel_unipotent_conjecture_and_the_vanishing_of_Massey_products_for_odd_rigid_fields","256703380_When_is_a_fourfold_Massey_product_defined","256205954_The_Brauer_group_and_the_center_of_generic_matrices","247752704_The_algebraic_topology_of_smooth_algebraic_varieties","246772663_Massey_products_and_maps_between_groups","243111996_On_certain_analogies_between_knots_and_primes","243111856_On_the_Galois_group_of_2-extensions_with_restricted_ramification","243086700_Milnor_invariants_and_Massey_products_for_prime_numbers","243017040_Cohomologische_Invarianten_quadratischer_Formen","242982004_Homology_massey_products_and_maps_between_groups","238248310_Infinitesimal_computations_in_topology","236814180_Descent_on_fibrations_over_the_projective_line","234059929_The_Zassenhaus_filtration_Massey_Products_and_Representations_ofProfinite_Groups","232276091_Splitting_Varieties_for_Triple_Massey_Products","228361630_The_norm_residue_isomorphism_theorem","226781703_Norm_Varieties_and_the_Chain_Lemma_After_Markus_Rost","226660052_Relations_between_K2_and_Galois_cohomology","226037878_Quadratic_forms_under_algebraic_extensions","225227740_Real_homotopy_theory_of_Khler_manifolds","222431641_Norm_Varieties","38335434_Algebraic_Extensions_of_Arbitrary_Fields","2108260_Massey_Products_and_Ideal_Class_Groups","1846105_Families_of_rationally_connected_varieties"]}
