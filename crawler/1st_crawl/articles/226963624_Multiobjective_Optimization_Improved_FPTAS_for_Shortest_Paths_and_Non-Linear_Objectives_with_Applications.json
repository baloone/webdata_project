{"id":"226963624_Multiobjective_Optimization_Improved_FPTAS_for_Shortest_Paths_and_Non-Linear_Objectives_with_Applications","abstract":"We provide an improved FPTAS for multiobjective shortest paths—a fundamental (NP-hard) problem in multiobjective optimization—along\nwith a new generic method for obtaining FPTAS to any multiobjective optimization problem with non-linear objectives. We show how these results can be used to obtain better approximate solutions to three related problems, multiobjective\nconstrained [optimal] path and non-additive shortest path, that have important applications in QoS routing and in traffic\noptimization. We also show how to obtain a FPTAS to a natural generalization of the weighted multicommodity flow problem with\nelastic demands and values that models several realistic scenarios in transportation and communication networks.","authors":["George Tsaggouris","Christos Zaroliagis"],"meta":["January 2006Theory of Computing Systems 45(1):162-186","DOI:10.1007/s00224-007-9096-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["266456558_IMPROVED_FPTAS_FOR_MULTIOBJECTIVE_SHORTEST_PATHS_WITH_APPLICATIONS","242932701_A_Method_for_Computing_Network_Equilibrium_with_Elastic_Demands","268886120_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Analysis_State_of_the_Art_Surveys","266256557_Multiple_Criteria_Optimization_-_State_of_the_Art_Annotated_Bibliographic_Surveys","265372525_Bicriterion_Path_Problems","250073605_Solving_a_Best_Path_Problem_when_the_Value_of_Time_Function_is_Nonlinear","242379576_Decision_Making_Based_on_Approximate_and_Smoothed_Pareto","230595783_Approximation_of_Pareto_Optima_in_Multiple-Objective_Shortest-Path_Problems","230595730_Studies_in_Economics_of_Transportation","230595724_Approximation_Schemes_for_the_Restricted_Shortest_Path_Problem"]}
