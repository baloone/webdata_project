{"id":"320516883_Forward_Analysis_for_WSTS_Part_III_Karp-Miller_Trees","abstract":"This paper is a sequel of \"Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part I: Completions\" [STACS 2009, LZI Intl. Proc. in Informatics 3, 433-444] and \"Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part II: Complete WSTS\" [Logical Methods in Computer Science 8(3), 2012]. In these two papers, we provided a framework to conduct forward reachability analyses of WSTS, using finite representations of downwards-closed sets. We further develop this framework to obtain a generic Karp-Miller algorithm for the new class of very-WSTS. This allows us to show that coverability sets of very-WSTS can be computed as their finite ideal decompositions. Under natural assumptions on positive sequences, we also show that LTL model checking for very-WSTS is decidable. The termination of our procedure rests on a new notion of acceleration levels, which we study. We characterize those domains that allow for only finitely many accelerations, based on ordinal ranks.","authors":["Michael Blondin","Alain Finkel","Jean Goubault-Larrecq"],"meta":["October 2017","Project: Well Structured Transition Systems"],"references":["243769368_Well_structured_transition_systems_everywhere_Theoretical_Computer_Science","220896734_A_Generalization_of_the_Procedure_of_Karp_and_Miller_to_Well_Structured_Transition_Systems","350671895_Forward_Analysis_for_WSTS_Part_II_Complete_WSTS","303862672_Coverability_Trees_for_Petri_Nets_with_Unordered_Data","279287687_o-Petri_Nets_Algorithms_and_Complexity","267434453_A_Constructive_Proof_of_the_Topological_Kruskal_Theorem","266013493_Dimension_de_Krull_des_ensembles_ordonnes_Krull_dimension_of_ordered_sets","223353973_Expand_Enlarge_and_Check_New_algorithms_for_the_coverability_problem_of_WSTS","221498280_Parallel_Program_Schemata_A_Mathematical_Model_for_Parallel_Computation","220430605_On_Context-Free_Languages"]}
