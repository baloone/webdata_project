{"id":"341458408_Accurate_deep_neural_network_inference_using_computational_phase-change_memory","abstract":"In-memory computing using resistive memory devices is a promising non-von Neumann approach for making energy-efficient deep learning inference hardware. However, due to device variability and noise, the network needs to be trained in a specific way so that transferring the digitally trained weights to the analog resistive memory devices will not result in significant loss of accuracy. Here, we introduce a methodology to train ResNet-type convolutional neural networks that results in no appreciable accuracy loss when transferring weights to phase-change memory (PCM) devices. We also propose a compensation technique that exploits the batch normalization parameters to improve the accuracy retention over time. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.7% on CIFAR-10 and a top-1 accuracy of 71.6% on ImageNet benchmarks after mapping the trained weights to PCM. Our hardware results on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-32 demonstrate an accuracy above 93.5% retained over a one-day period, where each of the 361,722 synaptic weights is programmed on just two PCM devices organized in a differential configuration.","authors":["Vinay Joshi","Manuel Le Gallo","Simon Haefeli","Irem Boybat"],"meta":["May 2020Nature Communications 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-16108-9"],"references":["341319430_Mixed-Precision_Deep_Learning_Based_on_Computational_Memory","339362267_An_overview_of_phase-change_memory_device_physics","338905647_Fully_hardware-implemented_memristor_convolutional_neural_network","335406015_CMOS-integrated_memristive_non-volatile_computing-in-memory_for_AI_edge_processors","340288631_Memory_devices_and_applications_for_in-memory_computing","339266288_Reducing_the_Impact_of_Phase-Change_Memory_Conductance_Drift_on_the_Inference_of_large-scale_Hardware_Neural_Networks","338797903_Phase-Change_Memory_Models_for_Deep_Learning_Training_and_Inference","338551638_Resistive_switching_materials_for_information_processing","337117275_Monolithically_Integrated_RRAM-_and_CMOS-Based_In-Memory_Computing_Optimizations_for_Efficient_Deep_Learning","336161392_Improving_Noise_Tolerance_of_Mixed-Signal_Neural_Networks"]}
