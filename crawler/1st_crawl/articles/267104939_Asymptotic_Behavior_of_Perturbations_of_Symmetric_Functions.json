{"id":"267104939_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Perturbations_of_Symmetric_Functions","abstract":"In this paper we consider perturbations of symmetric Boolean functions \\({{\\sigma_{n,k_1}} +\\ldots+{\\sigma_{n,k_s}}}\\) in n-variable and degree k\ns\n. We compute the asymptotic behavior of Boolean functions of the type\n$${\\sigma_{n,k_1}} +\\ldots+{\\sigma_{n,k_s}} +F(X_1, . . . , X_j)$$for j fixed. In particular, we characterize all the Boolean functions of the type\n$${\\sigma_{n,k_1}} +\\ldots+{\\sigma_{n,k_s}} +F(X_1, . . . , X_j)$$that are asymptotic balanced. We also present an algorithm that computes the asymptotic behavior of a family of Boolean functions from one member of the family. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we provide a relation between the parity of families of sums of binomial coefficients.","authors":["Francis Castro","Luis A Medina"],"meta":["September 2014Annals of Combinatorics 18(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00026-014-0230-0"],"references":["257770227_Finding_Hamming_weights_without_looking_at_truth_tables","257770216_Weights_of_Boolean_cubic_monomial_rotation_symmetric_functions","239921608_On_a_conjecture_for_balanced_symmetric_Boolean_functions","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","226218829_On_the_Correlation_of_Symmetric_Functions","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","51952918_On_-Variable_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","47805479_Distortion_maps_for_supersingular_genus_two_curves","3086750_Balanced_Symmetric_Functions_Over_hboxGFp","3085505_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","288174377_Bent_Boolean_functions","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","267078413_Cryptographic_Boolean_Functions_and_Applications","256391988_On_bent_functions","223083757_Correlation_immunity_and_resiliency_of_symmetric_Boolean_functions","222592149_K-th_order_symmetric_SAC_boolean_functions_and_bisecting_binomial_coefficients","221671565_A_Note_on_a_Conjecture_for_Balanced_Elementary_Symmetric_BooleanFunctions","220638891_Asymptotic_Nonlinearity_of_Boolean_Functions","220638191_On_Boolean_functions_with_the_sum_of_every_two_of_them_being_bent","220442010_Polynomials_with_two_Values","220349114_On_Cryptographic_Properties_of_Random_Boolean_Functions","220296928_On_the_Bent_Boolean_Functions_That_are_Symmetric","220187657_Balancedness_and_Correlation_Immunity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220113134_Linear_structures_of_symmetric_functions_over_finite_fields","48194964_Linear_Recurrences_and_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Exponential_Sums_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","45873270_Asymptotic_enumeration_of_correlation-immune_boolean_functions","3086421_A_Note_on_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity_in_Odd_Number_of_Variables","3085145_On_the_Degree_Nonlinearity_Algebraic_Thickness_and_Nonnormality_of_Boolean_Functions_With_Developments_on_Symmetric_Functions","3080777_Maximum_nonlinearity_of_symmetric_Boolean_functions_on_odd_number_of_variables"]}
