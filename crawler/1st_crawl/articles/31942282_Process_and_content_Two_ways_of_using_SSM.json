{"id":"31942282_Process_and_content_Two_ways_of_using_SSM","abstract":"Soft systems methodology (SSM) includes several ways of gaining a rich appreciation of the problem situation addressed. ‘Analysis One’, exploration of the intervention itself, is the subject here, since it is sparsely covered in the literature. The analysis is conducted in terms of three roles: ‘client’, ‘problem solver’ and ‘problem owner’. Whoever is in the role of ‘problem solver’ is free to define a list of possible ‘problem owners’, which brings many perspectives to bear on the situation. It was realized that ‘client’ and ‘problem solver’ should themselves feature in the ‘problem owner’ list. The ‘problem’ owned by the ‘problem solver’ is that of undertaking the intervention. This led to a realization that SSM is relevant to both the content of a perceived situation (SSMc) and the process of dealing with that content (SSMp). This development is described and illustrated by work in the National Health Service. The focus of the SSM use was to define the intellectual process for a service specification project which NHS professionals would themselves carry out.Journal of the Operational Research Society (2006) 57, 1435–1441. doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602118 Published online 28 December 2005","authors":["P Checkland","M Winter"],"meta":["December 2006Journal of the Operational Research Society 57(12)","DOI:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602118"],"references":["264082838_System_Thinking_System_Practice","261992222_Soft_System_Methodology_in_Action","247568200_Soft_Systems_Methodology_a_30-year_retrospective","245280953_Obituary_C_West_Churchman_1913-2004","238362212_Toward_a_Systems-Based_Methodology_for_Real-World_Problem_Solving","226335548_The_problem-solving_system_Another_problem-content_system"]}
