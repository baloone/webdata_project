{"id":"309484116_Computations_of_the_Mertens_Function_and_Improved_Bounds_on_the_Mertens_Conjecture","abstract":"The Mertens function is defined as $M(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\mu(n)$, where $\\mu(n)$ is the M\\\"obius function. The Mertens conjecture states $|M(x)/\\sqrt{x}| < 1$ for $x > 1$, which was proven false in 1985 by showing $\\liminf M(x)/\\sqrt{x} < -1.009$ and $\\limsup M(x)/\\sqrt{x} > 1.06$. The same techniques used were revisited here with present day hardware and algorithms, giving improved lower and upper bounds of $-1.837625$ and $1.826054$. In addition, $M(x)$ was computed for all $x \\leq 10^{16}$, recording all extrema, all zeros, and $10^8$ values sampled at a regular interval. Lastly, an algorithm to compute $M(x)$ in $O(x^{2/3+\\varepsilon})$ time was used on all powers of two up to $2^{73}$.","authors":["Greg Hurst"],"meta":["October 2016Mathematics of Computation 87(310)","DOI:10.1090/mcom/3275"],"references":["254910472_Further_systematic_computations_on_the_summatory_function_of_the_Mobius_function","230868342_Linear_relations_of_zeroes_of_the_zeta-function","38338558_On_the_Order_of_the_Mertens_Function","2355126_Disproof_of_the_Mertens_Conjecture","268608471_The_Theory_of_the_Riemann_Zeta-Function","226422613_A_Successive_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Divisor_SummatoryFunction","222459000_Computing_px_An_analytic_method","38338255_Computing_the_Summation_of_the_Mobius_Function"]}
