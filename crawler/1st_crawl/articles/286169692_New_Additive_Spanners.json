{"id":"286169692_New_Additive_Spanners","abstract":"This paper considers additive and purely additive spanners. We present a new purely additive spanner of size Õ(n7/5) with additive stretch 4. This construction fills in the gap between the two existing constructions for purely additive spanners, one for 2-additive spanner of size O(n3/2) and the other for 6-additive spanner of size O(n 4/3), and thus answers a main open question in this area. In addition, we present a construction for additive spanners with Õ(n 1+δ) edges and additive stretch of Õ(n 1/2-3δ/2) for any 3/17 ≤ δ < 1/3, improving the stretch of the existing constructions from O(n1-3δ) to Õ(√n1-3δ). Finally, we show that our (1,n 1/2-3δ/2)-spanner construction can be tweaked to give a sublinear additive spanner of size Õ(n1+3/17) with additive stretch O(√distance).","authors":["Shiri Chechik"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973105.36"],"references":["234810199_Additive_spanners_and_a_b-spanners","234785685_New_constructions_of_a_b-spanners_and_purely_additive_spanners","220778960_Sparse_Distance_Preservers_and_Additive_Spanners","220452641_On_Sparse_Spanners_of_Weighted_Graphs","220431797_Trade-off_between_space_and_efficiency_for_routing_tables","220390585_Computing_Almost_Shortest_Paths","1960170_A_near-optimal_fully_dynamic_distributed_algorithm_for_maintaining_sparse_spanners","262372119_Compact_routing_schemes_with_improved_stretch","234802032_1_eB_-spanner_constructions_for_general_graphs","229335749_Spanners_and_message_distribution_in_networks","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","227725251_Graph_spanners","225177720_Deterministic_Constructions_of_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_Spanners","225110587_Additive_Spanners_in_Nearly_Quadratic_Time","221499080_Lower_Bounds_for_Additive_Spanners_Emulators_and_More","221343405_An_Optimal_Synchronizer_for_the_Hypercube","220779411_Spanners_and_emulators_with_sublinear_distance_errors","220618243_1_epsilonbeta-Spanner_Constructions_for_General_Graphs","220616824_Fast_Estimation_of_Diameter_and_Shortest_Paths_Without_Matrix_Multiplication","2907921_Compact_Routing_Schemes"]}
