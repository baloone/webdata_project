{"id":"340976152_A_Hybrid_Downlink_Scheduling_Approach_for_Multi-Traffic_Classes_in_LTE_Wireless_Systems","abstract":"The developments in wireless technology and applications in recent years have increased the interest in downlink scheduling and resource allocations among researchers. Moreover, fair scheduling and balanced Quality of Service (QoS) delivery for various forms of traffic are needed for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless systems. This paper proposes hybrid QoS-aware downlink scheduling approaches that aim to address different traffic classes and balance the QoS delivery with improvements to the overall system performance under channel and bandwidth constraints. Moreover, this research introduces a taxonomy that classifies the scheduling algorithms into four main classes: delay aware, queue aware, target bit-rate aware and hybrid aware. The latter class is the scheduling class that is proposed in this paper; it considers channel, queue and delay parameters in its scheduling metric. Using simulations, we compare and analyze different downlink scheduling rules for their network-centric performance metrics, e.g., average packet loss ratio, average throughput, average packet delay, system fairness, and system spectral efficiency. The simulation results show that the queue-aware and delay-aware scheduling rules deliver the best QoS performance for video traffic classes, whereas our proposed hybrid scheduling rules deliver balanced QoS for various types of traffic classes. Employing QoS balancing scheduling rules in an LTE downlink is suggested to provide high QoS delivery for different traffic classes.","authors":["Moustafa M.
