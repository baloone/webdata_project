{"id":"260780408_Z2Z4-linear_codes_generator_matrices_and_duality","abstract":"A code ${\\cal C}$ is $\\Z_2\\Z_4$-additive if the set of coordinates can\nbe partitioned into two subsets $X$ and $Y$ such that the punctured code\nof ${\\cal C}$ by deleting the coordinates outside $X$ (respectively,\n$Y$) is a binary linear code (respectively, a quaternary linear code).\nIn this paper $\\Z_2\\Z_4$-additive codes are studied. Their corresponding\nbinary images, via the Gray map, are $\\Z_2\\Z_4$-linear codes, which seem\nto be a very distinguished class of binary group codes. As for binary\nand quaternary linear codes, for these codes the fundamental parameters\nare found and standard forms for generator and parity check matrices are\ngiven. For this, the appropriate inner product is deduced and the\nconcept of duality for $\\Z_2\\Z_4$-additive codes is defined. Moreover,\nthe parameters of the dual codes are computed. Finally, some conditions\nfor self-duality of $\\Z_2\\Z_4$-additive codes are given.","authors":["Joaquim Borges","Cristina Fernández-Córdoba","Jaume Pujol","Josep Rifa"],"meta":["October 2007"],"references":["241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","320136842_On_extremal_additive_F4_codes_of_length_10_to_18","268974567_The_Association_Schemes_of_Coding_Theory","268533745_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","267478927_On_Z_2_Z_4_-linear_codes_and_duality","265373520_Group_Partitions_and_Mixed_Perfect_Codes","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","251148604_Every_Z2k-Code_is_a_Binary_Propelinear_Code","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes"]}
