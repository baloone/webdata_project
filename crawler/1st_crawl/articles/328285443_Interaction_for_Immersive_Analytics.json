{"id":"328285443_Interaction_for_Immersive_Analytics","abstract":"In this chapter, we briefly review the development of natural user interfaces and discuss their role in providing human-computer interaction that is immersive in various ways. Then we examine some opportunities for how these technologies might be used to better support data analysis tasks. Specifically, we review and suggest some interaction design guidelines for immersive analytics. We also review some hardware setups for data visualization that are already archetypal. Finally, we look at some emerging system designs that suggest future directions.","authors":["Wolfgang BÃ¼schel","Jian Chen","Raimund Dachselt","Steven M.
