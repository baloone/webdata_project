{"id":"261853697_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_the_P-median","abstract":"Consider a set L of potential locations for p facilities and a set U of locations of given users. The p-median problem is to locate simultaneously the p facilities at locations of L in order to minimize the total transportation cost for satisfying the demand of the users, each supplied from its closest facility. This model is a basic one in location theory and can also be interpreted in terms of cluster analysis where locations of users are then replaced by points in a given space. We propose several new Variable Neighborhood Search heuristics for the p-median problem and compare them with Greedy plus Interchange, and two Tabu Search heuristics.","authors":["Pierre Hansen","Nenad Mladenovic"],"meta":["December 1997Location Science 5(4)","DOI:10.1016/S0966-8349(98)00030-8"],"references":["277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","267954908_A_CHAIN-INTERCHANGE_TABU_SEARCH_METHOD_Tabu_search_in_solving_p-facility_location-allocation_problems","258338051_A_reverse_elimination_approach_for_the_p-Median_problem","255636835_Chain-interchange_heuristic_method","242931046_Heuristic_Methods_for_Estimating_the_Generalized_Vertex_Median_of_a_Weighted_Graph","227444614_Location_of_Bank_Accounts_to_Optimize_Float_An_Analytic_Study_of_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms","222810270_An_efficient_tabu_search_procedure_for_the_p-Median_Problem","220589774_Cluster_Analysis_and_Mathematical_Programming","266162785_Heuristic_cluster_algorithm_for_multiple_facility_location-allocation_problem","265367157_Graph_theory_An_algorithmic_approach","248656173_TSPLIB-A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","247632014_Stabilisation_dans_la_cadre_de_la_gmaonmaoration_de_colonnes","243772842_A_Fast_Algorithm_For_The_Greedy_Interchange_For_Large-Scale_Clustering_And_Median_Location_Problems","242916234_A_heuristic_for_large-size_p_-median_location_problems_with_application_to_school_location","242515197_A_new_adaptive_multi-start_technique_for_combinatorial_global_optimisation","242356629_A_Dual-Based_Procedure_for_Uncapacitated_Facility_Location","239328605_A_Dual-Bounded_Algorithm_for_the_p_-Median_Problem","235446798_An_Algorithmic_Approach_to_Network_Location_Problems_II_The_p_-Medians","235445120_Discrete_Location_Theory","234990840_Towards_practical_'neural'_computation_for_combinatorial_optimization_problems","227447865_A_Heuristic_Program_For_Locating_Warehouses","227446096_An_Overview_of_Representative_Problems_in_Location_Research","225804893_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Satisfiability_Problem","222474461_Variable_Neighborhood_Search","222444611_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","222291551_A_comparison_of_two_dual-based_procedures_for_solving_the_p-median_problem","220668826_TSPLIB_A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","220353907_On_the_Location_of_Supply_Points_to_Minimize_Transportation_Costs","4941356_Fast_primal_and_dual_heuristics_for_the_p-median_location_problem","4940366_A_note_on_solving_large_p-Median_problems"]}
