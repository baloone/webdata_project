{"id":"1770548_Approximation_of_definable_sets_by_compact_families_and_upper_bounds_on_homotopy_and_homology","abstract":"We prove new upper bounds on homotopy and homology groups of o-minimal sets in terms of their approximations by compact o-minimal\nsets. In particular, we improve the known upper bounds on Betti numbers of semialgebraic sets defined by quantifier-free formulae\nand obtain, for the first time, a singly exponential bound on Betti numbers of sub-Pfaffian sets.","authors":["Andrei Gabrielov","Nicolai Vorobjov"],"meta":["November 2007Journal of the London Mathematical Society 80(1)","DOI:10.1112/jlms/jdp006","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265373640_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_and_Sub-Pfaffian_Sets","242160156_Complexity_of_computations_with_Pfaffian_and_Noetherian_functions","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","312641475_Estimates_of_the_Betti_numbers_of_real_algebraic_hypersurfaces","266003854_Sur_l'homologie_des_varietes_algebriques_reelles","247029122_On_the_Betti_Numbers_of_Real_Varieties","243772840_On_the_Topology_of_Real_Algebraic_Hypersurfaces","238849686_Betti_numbers_of_semi-Pfaffian_sets","228392940_An_introduction_to_O-minimal_geometry","227280719_On_Bounding_the_Betti_Numbers_and_Computing_the_Euler_Characteristic_of_Semi-Algebraic_Sets"]}
