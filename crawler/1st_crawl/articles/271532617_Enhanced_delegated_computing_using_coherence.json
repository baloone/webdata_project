{"id":"271532617_Enhanced_delegated_computing_using_coherence","abstract":"A long-standing question is whether it is possible to delegate computational\ntasks securely. Recently, both a classical and a quantum solution to this\nproblem were found. Here, we study the interplay of classical and quantum\napproaches and show how coherence can be used as a tool for secure delegated\nclassical computation. We show that a client with limited computational\ncapacity - restricted to an XOR gate - can perform universal classical\ncomputation by manipulating information carriers that may occupy superpositions\nof two states. Using single photonic qubits or coherent light, we\nexperimentally implement secure delegated classical computations between an\nindependent client and a server. The server has access to the light sources and\nmeasurement devices, whereas the client may use only a restricted set of\npassive optical devices to manipulate the light beams. Thus, our work\nhighlights how minimal quantum and classical resources can be combined and\nexploited for classical computing.","authors":["Stefanie Barz","Vedran Dunjko","Florian Schlederer","Merritt Moore"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.032339","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268525365_A_quantum_approach_to_homomorphic_encryption","262452719_Quantum-enhanced_Secure_Delegated_Classical_Computing","259826560_Quantum_computing_on_encrypted_data","240309006_An_optimized_photon_pair_source_for_quantum_circuits","221768819_Demonstration_of_Blind_Quantum_Computing","275400394_Verification_for_measurement-only_blind_quantum_computing","259983793_Efficient_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","253753748_Nonadaptive_measurement-based_quantum_computation_and_multi-party_Bell_inequalities","241210519_Density_Operators_for_Coherent_Fields","229834176_Secure_multiparty_computation_with_a_dishonest_majority_via_quantum_means"]}
