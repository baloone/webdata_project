{"id":"286547684_Some_History_of_Human_Performance_Modeling","abstract":"The history of modeling aspects of human behavior is as long as the history of experimental psychology. However, only since the 1940s have integrated models reflected human perceptual, cognitive, and motor behavior. This chapter describes three major threads to this history: manual control models of human control in closed-loop systems; task networks models that fundamentally predict the probability of success and performance time in human-machine systems; and cognitive architectures that typically capture theories of human performance capacities and limitations, and the models derived from them tend to be more detailed in their representation of the substance of human information processing and cognition. In the past fifteen years, interest in using these kinds of models to predict human-machine performance in applied settings has accelerated their development. Many of the concepts originated in the early models, such as \"observation noise\" and \"moderator functions,\" live on in today's cognitive models.","authors":["Richard W.
