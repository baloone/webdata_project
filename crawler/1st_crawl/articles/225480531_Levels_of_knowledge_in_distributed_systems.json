{"id":"225480531_Levels_of_knowledge_in_distributed_systems","abstract":"We correlate the levels of knowledge of certain formulas in agroup of individuals with certain regular, downward closed, sets of strings. We show that in suitable circumstances, all such sets can occur as\nlevels of knowledge but that the lack of synchrony, or the lack of asynchrony when there are only two processors in the group,\ncan create more or less severe restrictions.","authors":["Rohit Parikh","Paul Krasucki"],"meta":["April 1992Sadhana 17(1):167-191","DOI:10.1007/BF02811342"],"references":["220567061_How_Processes_Learn","2597885_A_Little_Knowledge_Goes_a_Long_Way_Knowledge-based_derivations_and_correctness_proofs_for_a_family_of_protocols","240924567_Well-partial_orderings_and_hierarchies","238717639_Ordering_by_Divisibility_in_Abstract_Algebras","226100185_Programming_Simultaneous_Actions_Using_Common_Knowledge","221443221_Levels_of_Knowledge_in_Distributed_Computing","220827117_Distributed_Processes_and_the_Logic_of_Knowledge","213876567_Time_Clocks_and_the_Ordering_of_Events_in_a_Distributed_System","38358133_Agreeing_to_Disagree","4976746_Communication_consensus_and_knowledge"]}
