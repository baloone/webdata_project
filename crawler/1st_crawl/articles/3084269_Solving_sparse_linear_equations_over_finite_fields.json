{"id":"3084269_Solving_sparse_linear_equations_over_finite_fields","abstract":"A \"coordinate recurrence\" method for solving sparse systems of linear equations over finite fields is described. The algorithms discussed all require O(n_{1}(omega + n_{1})log^{k}n_{1}) field operations, where n_{1} is the maximum dimension of the coefficient matrix, omega is approximately the number of field operations required to apply the matrix to a test vector, and the value of k depends on the algorithm. A probabilistic algorithm is shown to exist for finding the determinant of a square matrix. Also, probabilistic algorithms are shown to exist for finding the minimum polynomial and rank with some arbitrarily small possibility of error.","authors":["DH WIEDEMANN"],"meta":["February 1986IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 32(1):54 - 62","DOI:10.1109/TIT.1986.1057137","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["269005589_Optimal_Rearrangeable_Multistage_Connecting_Networks","268730311_Continued_Fractions_and_Linear_Recurrences","266848407_Linear_recurring_sequences_and_error-correcting_codes","265352688_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","264376675_Optimal_Rearrangeable_Multistage_Connecting_Networks","250294811_On_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring_Integers","243582152_Analysis_and_comparison_of_some_integer_factoring_algorithms","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","234812500_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Verification_of_Polynomial_Identities","226117369_Schnelle_Multiplikation_von_Polynomen_ber_Krpern_der_Charakteristik_2","222617821_Coping_with_Errors_in_Binary_Search_Procedures","222441959_Fast_solution_of_Toeplitz_systems_and_computation_of_Pad_approximants","220685175_Fast_evaluation_of_logarithms_in_fields_of_characteristic_two","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","3081461_Shift-Register_Synthesis_and_BCH_Decoding"]}
