{"id":"337386416_CONCEPT_OF_DYNAMIC_BANDWIDTH_ALLOCATION_AND_SCHEDULING_ALGORITHMS_IN_PASSIVE_OPTICAL_NETWORKS","abstract":"Passive optical network is a broadband access technology that provides a cost effective infrastructure between the server and the users. PON is a point-to-multipoint optical network that uses passive components like optical splitter/combiner that provides a path between the user and the server. The performance evaluation of the optical access network is an important factor and is measured in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER), packet delay, packet loss probability, interference etc. Scheduling algorithm, DBA algorithm, network topology and crosstalk interference are the various issues that affects the performance of an optical network. In this paper, we have surveyed various DBA Algorithms.","authors":["Amit Kumar Kadian","Pushparaj Pal","Vishal Goyal"],"meta":["January 2013"],"references":["224439611_Implementation_of_Intra-ONU_Scheduling_for_Quality_of_Service_Support_in_Ethernet_Passive_Optical_Networks","216545888_Passive_optical_networks_Principles_and_practice","50315828_A_NOVEL_VIEW_ON_PASSIVE_OPTICAL_NETWORK_STRATEGIES_IN_THE_COMPUTER_COMMUNICATION","3454699_Ethernet_passive_optical_network_architectures_and_dynamic_bandwidth_allocation_algorithms","3417243_Intra-ONU_Bandwidth_Scheduling_in_Ethernet_Passive_Optical_Networks","296272603_PONs_for_the_broadband_local_loop","224126117_Remote_Repeater-Based_EPON_With_MAC_Forwarding_for_Long-Reach_and_High-Split-Ratio_Passive_Optical_Networks","4362769_A_framework_for_dynamic_bandwidth_allocation_algorithms_in_TDM_ethernet_passive_optical_networks","4173210_Analysis_of_a_bandwidth_allocation_protocol_for_Ethernet_passive_optical_networks_EPONs","4165898_A_high_efficient_dynamic_bandwidth_scheme_for_QoS_over_EPON_system"]}
