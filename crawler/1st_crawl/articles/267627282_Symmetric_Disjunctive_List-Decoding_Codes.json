{"id":"267627282_Symmetric_Disjunctive_List-Decoding_Codes","abstract":"A binary code is said to be a disjunctive list-decoding $s_L$-code, $s\\ge1$,\n$L\\ge1$, if the code is identified by the incidence matrix of a family of\nfinite sets in which the union (or disjunctive sum) of any $s$ sets can cover\nnot more than $L-1$ other sets of the family. In this paper, we consider a\nsimilar class of binary codes which are %symmetric disjunctive list-decoding\n$s_L$-codes and based on a {\\em symmetric disjunctive sum} (SDS) of binary\nsymbols. By definition, the symmetric disjunctive sum (SDS) takes values from\nthe ternary alphabet $\\{0,1,*\\}$, where the symbol $*$ denotes \"erasure\".\nNamely: SDS is equal to $0$ ($1$) if all its binary symbols are equal to $0$\n($1$), otherwise SDS is equal to $*$. List decoding codes for symmetric\ndisjunctive sum are said to be {\\em symmetric disjunctive list-decoding\n$s_L$-codes} (SLD $s_L$-codes). In the given paper, we remind some applications\nof SLD $s_L$-codes which motivate the concept of symmetric disjunctive sum. For\nthe ensemble of binary constant-weight codes we develop a random coding method\nto obtain lower bounds on the rate of these codes. Our lower bounds improve the\nknown random coding bounds obtained up to now using the ensemble with\nindependent symbols of codewords.","authors":["Arkadii Dâ€™yachkov","Ilya Vorobyev","Nikita Polyanskii","Vladislav Shchukin"],"meta":["January 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 82(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0278-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263811664_Almost_Disjunctive_List-Decoding_Codes","259954173_Lectures_on_Designing_Screening_Experiments","335204696_Binary_representations_of_underdetermined_data_and_superimposed_codes","312253181_List_decoding_for_a_multiple_access_hyperchannel","308829267_Symmetric_disjunctive_list-decoding_codes","269269431_Bounds_on_the_rate_of_superimposed_codes","268305684_On_constructions_of_list-decoding_superimposed_codes","268246467_Superimposed_distance_codes","266931866_Symmetric_binomial_group-testing_with_three_outcomes","266063828_Information_Theory_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Memoryless_Systems"]}
