{"id":"286729072_Design_and_Development_of_Novel_Ventilated_Clothing","abstract":"In the modern industry, operators have to face more and more extreme high-temperature environment. There is an urgent need to study how to reduce heat stress effectively. Air cooling system is an important way to reduce heat stress, but it is seldom used in general industry with high-temperature environment. In this study, a novel tube-style ventilated clothing with front opening and unsealed ventilation was designed and developed. The novel ventilated clothing has the characteristics of wearing easily, portability, small resistance, and better ergonomics, which can be integrated into various operation modes to solve the heat stress for workers. This helps air cooling system to be more widely applied in high-temperature environment.","authors":["Xinmei Guo","Xingjuan Zhang","Xiugan Yuan"],"meta":["October 2014Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering 259:451-459","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38968-9_52"],"references":["22665997_Fighter_Index_of_Thermal_Stress_FITS_guidance_for_hot-weather_aircraft_operations","328250252_Human_Thermal_Environments_The_Effects_of_Hot_Moderate_and_Cold_Environments_on_Human_Health_Comfort_and_Performance_Third_Edition","294361530_Physiological_basis_and_medical_requirements_for_the_design_of_liquid-cooled_garment_equipment"]}
