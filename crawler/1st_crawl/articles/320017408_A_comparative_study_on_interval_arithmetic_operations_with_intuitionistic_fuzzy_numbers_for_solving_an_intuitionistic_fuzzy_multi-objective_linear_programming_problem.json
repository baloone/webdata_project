IVIFNs are a construction which helps us to avoid such a prohibitive complexity. This paper is focused on two types of arithmetic operations on interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) to solve the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective linear programming problem with pentagonal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (PIFNs) by assuming different","authors":["Rajendran Vidhya","Irene Hepzibah"],"meta":["September 2017International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science 27(3)","DOI:10.1515/amcs-2017-0040"],"references":["304251055_An_adaptive_multi-spline_refinement_algorithm_in_simulation_based_sailboat_trajectory_optimization_using_onboard_multi-core_computer_systems","301731321_P_A_MODIFIED_NEW_OPERATIONS_FOR_INTERVAL_VALUED_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS_IVIFNS_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING_PROBLEM_WITH_HEXAGONAL_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS","267176217_A_multivariable_multiobjective_predictive_controller","267168310_Evolutionary_optimization_of_interval_mathematics-based_design_of_a_TSK_fuzzy_controller_for_anti-sway_crane_control","335973250_On_Interval_Valued_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","326415546_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_interval_valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","264149810_THE_ONE-SIDED_QUADRANGULAR_FUZZY_SETS","256992299_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst","245032035_Multiple_objective_linear_programming_models_with_interval_coefficients_-_an_illustrated_overview","243658533_Fuzzy_Logic_With_Engineering_Applications"]}
