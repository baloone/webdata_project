How to extract efficient and objective features to precisely identify the oil-water two-phase flow patterns is still a significant issue. Inspired by the deep learning hierarchically feature extraction way. We in this paper employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify oil-water two-phase flow patterns. First, we carry out oil-water two-phase flow experiment and collect different oil-water flow pattern images. Then we propose an image segment algorithm based on minimum gray level to obtain interest region that reflect the flow pattern characteristics. At last we employ three frequently used convolutional neural networks which are LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG-16 net to extract the image features and identify typical oil-water two-phase flow patterns. The results show that networks with more deep structures preserve relatively high flow pattern recognition accuracy. Our works provide a novel application of deep learning method to the oil-water two-phase flow identification.","authors":["Meng Du","Hongyi Yin","Xiaoyan Chen","Xinqiang Wang"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2888733"],"references":["328250452_Classification_of_machine_learning_frameworks_for_data-driven_thermal_fluid_models","322459621_Use_of_Deep_Learning_for_Characterization_of_Microfluidic_Soft_Sensors","321069732_Applications_of_Deep_Learning_and_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Biological_Data","319349778_Power_of_Deep_Learning_for_Channel_Estimation_and_Signal_Detection_in_OFDM_Systems","318360321_A_Deep_Learning_Architecture_for_Temporal_Sleep_Stage_Classification_Using_Multivariate_and_Multimodal_Time_Series","317062624_Deep_Learning_as_a_Tool_to_Predict_Flow_Patterns_in_Two-Phase_Flow","309487032_Artificial_neural_network_for_bubbles_pattern_recognition_on_the_images","305440641_Trunk-Branch_Ensemble_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Video-Based_Face_Recognition","292177312_A_New_Void_Fraction_Measurement_Method_for_Gas-Liquid_Two-Phase_Flow_in_Small_Channels","284578950_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition","277411157_Deep_Learning","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","326001874_Experimental_study_of_the_factors_affecting_the_flow_pattern_transition_in_horizontal_oil-water_flow","325478602_Classification_of_natural_circulation_two-phase_flow_image_patterns_based_on_self-organizing_maps_of_full_frame_DCT_coefficients","324934898_A_Light_CNN_for_Deep_Face_Representation_with_Noisy_Labels","323158731_Identification_of_liquid-gas_flow_regime_in_a_pipeline_using_gamma-ray_absorption_technique_and_computational_intelligence_methods","321955206_A_Novel_Multiplex_Network-Based_Sensor_Information_Fusion_Model_and_Its_Application_to_Industrial_Multiphase_Flow_System","321738697_Deep_Shrinkage_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Adaptive_Noise_Reduction","321138551_Fiber-Optic_Acoustic-Based_Disturbance_Prediction_in_Pipelines_Using_Deep_Learning","320050134_An_End-to-End_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Simultaneous_Speech_Dereverberation_and_Acoustic_Modeling_for_Robust_Speech_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319038540_Wavelet_Multiresolution_Complex_Network_for_Analyzing_Multivariate_Nonlinear_Time_Series","317297400_NetVLAD_CNN_architecture_for_weakly_supervised_place_recognition","316663744_Multiplex_multivariate_recurrence_network_from_multi-channel_signals_for_revealing_oil-water_spatial_flow_behavior","312665594_Complex_network_analysis_of_time_series","312538118_Support-vector_networks","309454521_Advanced_Neural_Network_prediction_and_System_Identification_of_Liquid-Liquid_Flow_Patterns_in_circular_microchannels_with_varying_angle_of_confluence","309270861_Reynolds_averaged_turbulence_modelling_using_deep_neural_networks_with_embedded_invariance","301846626_Frankenstein_Learning_Deep_Face_Representations_Using_Small_Data","299499587_A_Four-Sector_Conductance_Method_for_Measuring_and_Characterizing_Low-Velocity_Oil-Water_Two-Phase_Flows","266082888_Deep_Architecture_for_Traffic_Flow_Prediction_Deep_Belief_Networks_With_Multitask_Learning","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","261636111_PCANet_A_Simple_Deep_Learning_Baseline_for_Image_Classification","257445644_Image_Reconstruction_for_Invasive_ERT_in_Vertical_Oil_Well_Logging","254506550_Characterization_of_Oil-Water_Flow_Patterns_in_Vertical_and_Deviated_Wells","241114311_PIV_investigation_of_oil-mineral_interaction_for_an_oil_spill_application","239329278_A_new_method_and_means_for_recognizing_complex_pattern","229966777_The_Upward_Vertical_Flow_of_Oil-Water_Mixtures","223074686_Hilbert-Huang_transform_based_signal_analysis_for_the_characterization_of_gas-liquid_two-phase_flow","223032776_Performance_comparison_of_artificial_neural_networks_and_expert_systems_applied_to_flow_pattern_identification_in_vertical_ascendant_gas-liquid_flows"]}
