{"id":"325966558_A_Novel_Energy-Efficient_Protocol_for_WSN_based_on_Optimal_Chain_Routing","abstract":"Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Network is one of the most significant aspects of routing in these networks. WSN consist of thousands of sensory nodes densely distributed over wide geographical network. As these nodes are deployed in remote areas where recharging is not possible, even if it is possible it will incur high cost. So there is a need of a protocol which facilitates less energy dissipation and thereby enhances the overall performance of the network. We surveyed several protocols such as LEACH, PEGASIS, ACT etc. and concluded that important performance measures are First Node Die (FND), Half Node Alive (HNA) and Last Node Alive (LNA). Values for above mentioned parameters vary for different protocols. In this paper we present a new protocol Energy Efficient Optimal Chain Protocol (EEOC) which outperforms all above mentioned protocols. We compared the results of all these protocols with EEOC and found that with respect to FND, HNA and LNA EEOC performs way better than others.","authors":["Arun Agarwal","Khushboo Jain","K P Yadav"],"meta":["March 2016","Conference: Proceedings of the 10th INDIACom; INDIACom-2016; IEEE Conference ID: 37465 2016 3rd International Conference on “Computing for Sustainable Global Development”, 16th - 18th March, 2016At: Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management (BVICAM), New Delhi (INDIA)","Project: data management in WSN"],"references":["261958666_Fundamentals_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Theory_and_Practice","224466643_An_Adaptive_LLC-Based_and_Hierarchical_Power-Aware_Routing_Algorithm","224181975_Distributed_Minimum_Transmission_Multicast_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220670260_Improvement_on_LEACH_protocol_of_wireless_sensor_network_VLEACH","220198704_T-LEACH_The_method_of_threshold-based_cluster_head_replacement_for_wireless_sensor_networks","224071752_Energy-efficient_communication_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","220766568_W-LEACH_Weighted_Low_Energy_Adaptive_Clustering_Hierarchy_Aggregation_Algorithm_for_Data_Streams_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220465718_Rendezvous_Planning_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_with_Mobile_Elements","220315102_Arranging_cluster_sizes_and_transmission_ranges_for_wireless_sensor_networks","4359937_A_Cluster_Maintenance_Algorithm_Based_on_LEACH-DCHS_Protoclol","3199342_A_Centralized_Energy-Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3181314_Cluster_based_self-organization_management_protocols_for_wireless_Sensor_Networks","3968599_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems"]}
