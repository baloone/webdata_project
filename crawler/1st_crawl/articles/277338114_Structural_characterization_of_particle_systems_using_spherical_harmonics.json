{"id":"277338114_Structural_characterization_of_particle_systems_using_spherical_harmonics","abstract":"Many important properties of particulate materials are heavily influenced by the size and shape of the constituent particles. Thus, in order to control and improve product quality, it is important to develop a good understanding of the shape and size of the particles that make up a given particulate material. In this paper, we show how the spherical harmonics expansion can be used to approximate particles obtained from tomographic 3D images. This yields an analytic representation of the particles which can be used to calculate structural characteristics. We present an estimation method for the optimal length of expansion depending on individual particle shapes, based on statistical hypothesis testing. A suitable choice of this parameter leads to a smooth approximation that preserves the main shape features of the original particle. To show the wide applicability of this procedure, we use it to approximate particles obtained from two different tomographic 3D datasets of particulate materials. The first one describes an anode material from lithium-ion cells that consists of sphere-like particles with different sizes. The second dataset describes a powder of highly non-spherical titanium dioxide particles.","authors":["Julian Feinauer","Aaron Spettl","Ingo Manke","Stefan Strege"],"meta":["August 2015Materials Characterization 106(26)","DOI:10.1016/j.matchar.2015.05.023"],"references":["306277353_Use_of_watersheds_in_contour_detection","275648021_Micromorphology_characterization_and_reconstruction_of_sand_particles_using_micro_X-ray_tomography_and_spherical_harmonics","265158823_Paper_No_11-3891_Life-Cycle_Analysis_for_Lithium-Ion_Battery_Production_and_Recycling","259214318_In_Situ_Microtomographic_Monitoring_of_Discharging_Processes_in_Alkaline_Cells","258227420_Defining_Shape_Measures_for_3D_Star-Shaped_Particles_Sphericity_Roundness_and_Dimensions","256606239_Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Volumes_from_Digital_Grey-Scale_Images","232748534_Slow_relaxation_and_compaction_of_granular_system","231647784_3D_Imaging_of_Catalyst_Support_Corrosion_in_Polymer_Electrolyte_Fuel_Cells","230837870_The_Morphological_Approach_to_Segmentation_The_Watershed_Transformation","228397075_Stochastic_watershed_segmentation","221293057_Measuring_Intrinsic_Volumes_in_Digital_3d_Images","202232994_The_Watershed_Transform_Definitions_Algorithms_and_Parallelization_Strategies","51957437_Spatial_modeling_of_the_3D_morphology_of_hybrid_polymer-ZnO_solar_cellsbased_on_electron_tomography_data","51642439_Quantitative_Structural_Assessment_of_Heterogeneous_Catalysts_by_Electron_Tomography","2879434_The_Watershed_Transform_Definitions_Algorithms_and_Parallelization_Strategies","284777079_The_Aesthetics_and_Practice_of_Designing_Interactive_Computer_Events","284025787_Glossary_of_atmospheric_chemistry_terms_Recommendations_1990","271923572_Approach_to_structural_anisotropy_in_compacted_cohesive_powder","263295141_Intensive_Dry_and_Wet_Mixing_Influencing_the_Structural_and_Electrochemical_Properties_of_Secondary_Lithium-Ion_Battery_Cathodes","259515716_Low-temperature_charging_of_lithium-ion_cells_part_I_Electrochemical_modeling_and_experimental_investigation_of_degradation_behavior","259214298_3D_visualization_of_PEMFC_electrode_structures_using_FIB_tomography","258741951_From_Particle_to_Powder_Properties_-_A_Mesoscopic_Approach_Combining_Micro-Scale_Experiments_and_X-ray_Microtomography","257224546_Influence_of_electrode_preparation_on_the_electrochemical_performance_of_LiNi08Co015Al005O2_composite_electrodes_for_lithium-ion_batteries","256606242_Local_Digital_Algorithms_for_Estimating_the_Integrated_Mean_Curvature_of_r-Regular_Sets","248147456_Training_structuring_elements_in_morphological_networks","244156778_Breaking_characteristics_of_different_materials_and_their_effect_on_stress_intensity_and_stress_number_in_stirred_media_mills","243770937_Sulla_Determinazione_Empirica_di_una_Legge_Distribuzione","242654550_Stochastic_3D_modeling_of_La06Sr04CoO_3-d_cathodes_based_on_structural_segmentation_of_FIB-SEM_images","242359044_Modeling_of_Galvanostatic_Charge_and_Discharge_of_the_LithiumPolymerInsertion_Cell","240568667_Volume_Shape_and_Roundness_of_Quartz_Particles","240568636_Sphericity_and_Roundness_of_Rock_Particles","239270283_Glossary_of_Atmospheric_Chemistry_Terms","238167932_Evaluation_of_sphericity_error_from_form_data_using_computational_geometric_techniques","236629057_Stereological_Modelling_of_Random_Particles","233951998_Neutron_tomographic_investigations_of_water_distributions_in_polymer_electrolyte_membrane_fuel_cell_stacks","230019437_Effect_of_Important_Precipitation_Process_Parameters_on_the_Redispersion_Process_and_the_Micromechanical_Properties_of_Precipitated_Silica","224817392_On_Estimation_of_Probability_Density_Function_and_Mode","223652980_Slurry_Rheology_in_Wet_Ultrafine_Grinding_of_Industrial_Minerals_A_Review","222827647_Three-dimensional_mathematical_analysis_of_particle_shape_using_X-ray_tomography_and_spherical_harmonics_Application_to_aggregates_used_in_concrete","222432148_Calculating_geometric_properties_of_three-dimensional_objects_from_the_spherical_harmonic_representation","222264687_Recent_advances_in_lithium_ion_battery_materials","220913937_Shapes_and_Metrics","220610665_Estimation_of_surface_area_and_surface_area_measure_of_three-dimensional_sets_from_digitizations","216046085_In_situ_Synchrotron_X-ray_Radiography_Investigations_of_Water_Transport_in_PEM_Fuel_Cells","38367114_Remarks_on_Some_Non-Parametric_Estimates_of_a_Density_Function","38364039_Choosing_a_Point_from_the_Surface_of_a_Sphere","24221326_Electron_Tomography_and_Holography_in_Materials_Science","2476331_Rotation_Invariant_Spherical_Harmonic_Representation_of_3D_Shape_Descriptors","2271262_A_Fast_Transform_for_Spherical_Harmonics"]}
