{"id":"261264584_Achieving_Pareto_Optimal_Equilibria_in_Energy_Efficient_Clustered_Ad_Hoc_Networks","abstract":"In this paper, a decentralized iterative algorithm, namely the optimal dynamic learning (ODL) algorithm, is analysed. The ability of this algorithm of achieving a Pareto optimal working point exploiting only a minimal amount of information is shown. The algorithm performance is analysed in a clustered ad hoc network, where radio devices are assumed to operate above a minimal signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) threshold while minimizing the global power consumption. Sufficient analytical conditions for ODL to converge to the desired working point are provided, moreover through numerical simulations the ability of the algorithm to configure an interference limited network is shown. The performances of ODL and of a Nash equilibrium reaching algorithm are numerically compared, and their performance as a function of available resources is studied. The gain of ODL is shown to be larger when the amount of available radio resources is scarce.","authors":["Luca Rose","Samir Perlaza","Christophe J.
