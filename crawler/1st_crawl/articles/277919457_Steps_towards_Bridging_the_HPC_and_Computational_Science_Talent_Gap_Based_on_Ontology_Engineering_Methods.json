{"id":"277919457_Steps_towards_Bridging_the_HPC_and_Computational_Science_Talent_Gap_Based_on_Ontology_Engineering_Methods","abstract":"The paper describes an ontology-based methods and framework for design of learning courses covering the HPC and Big Data areas and how to include these into Computational Science training within the remit of existing courses of Master Programme entitled “Applied Mathematics and Computer Science” (Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Perm State University, Russia). It helped bringing together the university and IT-companies around a real industry projects in the field of Big Data with active participation of master's students. In this paper, the visual tools and ontology-based methods for computer-supported collaborative learning environment will be also presented.","authors":["Svetlana Chuprina"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 51(1):1705-1713","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.308"],"references":["270980044_Development_of_Multiplatform_Adaptive_Rendering_Tools_to_Visualize_Scientific_Experiments","257719865_Adaptive_Scientific_Visualization_System_for_Desktop_Computers_and_Mobile_Devices","290561818_Using_ontology_and_metadata_to_integrate_elearning_resources_and_administrative_information_system_of_university","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","220374724_Evaluating_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_Design_Patterns_the_DEPTHS_Experience"]}
