{"id":"346535654_CR_Rao_Articleshort-AmStatNews_Sept_2020","abstract":"We review the foundational contributions of Professor C.R. Rao to the science of statistics, in celebration of his 100th birthday. Rao, a living legend, has had profound and continuing influence on statistical theory and practice since 1941. A brief summary of his work in each of five areas of statistics is presented: (1) design of experiments; (2) estimation theory; (3) information geometry; (4) hypothesis testing; and (5) multivariate theory and practice. Rao's work, although often theoretical in nature, was often motivated by problems from other sciences. As a result, it had great impact across a broad array of disciplines from the biological, medical and social sciences to theoretical physics, computer science and engineering. He is recognized as as one of the greatest scientists in history.","authors":["B.L.S. Prakasa Rao","Randy L. Carter","Frank Nielsen","Alan Agresti"],"meta":["December 2020"],"references":[]}
