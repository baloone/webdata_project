{"id":"338619166_Design_and_analysis_of_the_rotational_binary_graph_as_an_alternative_to_hypercube_and_Torus","abstract":"Network cost is equal to degree × diameter and is one of the important measurements when evaluating graphs. Torus and hypercube are very well-known graphs. When these graphs expand, a Torus has an advantage in that its degree does not increase. A hypercube has a shorter diameter than that of other graphs, because when the graph expands, the diameter increases by 1. Hypercube Qn has 2ⁿ nodes, and its diameter is n. We propose the rotational binary graph (RBG), which has the advantages of both hypercube and Torus. RBGn has 2ⁿ nodes and a degree of 4. The diameter of RBGn would be 1.5n + 1. In this paper, we first examine the topology properties of RBG. Second, we construct a binary spanning tree in RBG. Third, we compare other graphs to RBG considering network cost specifically. Fourth, we suggest a broadcast algorithm with a time complexity of 2n − 2. Finally, we prove that RBGn embedded into hypercube Qn results in dilation n, and expansion 1, and congestion 7.","authors":["Jung-Hyun Seo","HyeongOk Lee"],"meta":["September 2020The Journal of Supercomputing 76(10)","DOI:10.1007/s11227-019-03115-x"],"references":["327162124_A_New_Static_Cost-Effective_Parameter_for_Interconnection_Networks_of_Massively_Parallel_Computer_Systems","321074228_The_hierarchical_Petersen_network_a_new_interconnection_network_with_fixed_degree","315955318_Fault-tolerant_routing_methodology_for_hypercube_and_cube-connected_cycles_interconnection_networks","261832769_Link-Disjoint_Broadcasting_Algorithm_in_Wormhole-Routed_3D_Petersen-Torus_Networks","325422540_SuperSim_Extensible_Flit-Level_Simulation_of_Large-Scale_Interconnection_Networks","324401027_Interconnection_Networks","321828302_Cube-Connected_Circulants_as_Efficient_Models_for_Interconnection_Networks","301908101_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_nk-Star_Graphs_under_the_PMC_Model","301854456_Recursive_cubes_of_rings_as_models_for_interconnection_networks","301728170_Embedding_Algorithm_among_Half_Pancake_Pancake_and_Star_Graphs","257666442_Three-dimensional_Petersen-torus_network_A_fixed-degree_network_for_massively_parallel_computers","244447263_Why_Network_Diameter_is_Still_Important","221994997_Hierarchical_star_A_new_two_level_interconnection_network","220379328_Hierarchical_Hypercube_Networks_HHN_for_Massively_Parallel_Computers","3300964_3D_hexagonal_network_Modeling_topological_properties_addressing_scheme_and_optimal_routing_algorithm"]}
