{"id":"324976346_Hausdorff-Besicovitch_Dimension_of_Lake_Nasser_Coastline_from_Satellite_Imagery","abstract":"The paper is proposing a method for evaluating the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension of natural coastlines from satellite images.\nA fractal dimension is a statistical index which is describing the complexity of a given pattern embedded in given spatial dimensions. In particular, this index is providing a measure of the capacity the considered fractal pattern has to fill the space in which it is embedded .","authors":["Amelia Carolina Sparavigna"],"meta":["January 2018Philica 2018(1221)","Project: Image Segmentation"],"references":["326367528_Image_segmentation_applied_to_satellite_imagery_for_monitoring_water_in_lakes_and_reservoirs","321572582_Measuring_the_blood_cells_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","321209886_An_image_segmentation_for_the_measurement_of_microstructures_in_ductile_cast_iron","321049043_Image_Segmentation_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Fabric_Textures","319537185_Measuring_the_size_of_tubules_in_phloem_and_xylem_of_plants","313569115_Image_segmentation_applied_to_micrographs_of_microcellular_plastics","311737982_Analysis_of_a_natural_honeycomb_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","309573462_Entropies_and_fractal_dimensions","299457328_Fractal_Growth_Phenomena_Chapter_4","268018789_Space-Filling_Curves"]}
