{"id":"315653996_A_Novel_Network_Security_Algorithm_Based_on_Encrypting_Text_into_a_White-page_Image","abstract":"â€”Nowadays, data security becomes a big issue and a\nchallenge when sending sensitive data through the Internet. For\nexample; sending user password, performing money\ntransaction (e-business) using a master card, and invoking\nmethods on a remote PC. All these activities require a secure\nalgorithm for protecting data from hackers and thus keep\ninformation private and save.\nThere are various methods for securing data when they are\nsent through the global network. Some of these techniques are\nbased on data encryption algorithms where the text message is\nencrypted (scrambled) to another form that is not readable by\nhumans. One of the encryption techniques is based on the\ntransformation of a text into an image. In this paper, we\npropose a simple and a novel data encryption algorithm based\non encrypting a text into a white page image (White-Page\nImage Encryption Algorithm or the WPI algorithm).\nIn this paper, the proposed White-Page Image Encryption\nAlgorithm is tested and analyzed.","authors":["Ahmad Abusukhon","Zeyad Mohammad","Talib Mohammad"],"meta":["October 2016","Conference: Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering and Computer ScienceAt: San Francisco, USAVolume: 1"],"references":["298438434_Encryption_of_a_Binary_String_Using_Music_Notes_and_Graph_theory","291019303_A_Secure_Network_Communication_Protocol_Based_on_Text_to_Barcode_Encryption_Algorithm","282656955_Distributed_Text-to-Image_Encryption_Algorithm","282656545_Analyzing_the_Efficiency_of_Text-to-Image_Encryption_Algorithm","282656379_BLOCK_CIPHER_ENCRYPTION_FOR_TEXT-TO-IMAGE_ALGORITHM","265380788_A_Symmetric_Key_Algorithm_for_Cryptography_using_Music","316072195_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","293302060_Time_Stamp_Based_ECC_Encryption_and_Decryption","268183026_A_n_2_n_MQV_Key_Agreement_Protocol","263928465_Innovative_Approach_to_Improve_Hybrid_Cryptography_by_Using_DNA_Steganography"]}
