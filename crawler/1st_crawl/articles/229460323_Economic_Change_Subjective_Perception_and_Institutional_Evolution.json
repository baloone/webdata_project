{"id":"229460323_Economic_Change_Subjective_Perception_and_Institutional_Evolution","abstract":"Following Hayek's intuitions on the role of subjective perception in economics, I attempt to integrate path-dependent dynamics in evolutionary economics, as emerging in the recent theorizing about economic change. The starting point is an open question in evolutionary economics: is there a unifying principle which characterizes change at individual, organizational and institutional levels? In the attempt to answer this question, I propose some considerations on the nature of learning processes and on the mechanisms of adjustment, discovery and selection that are consistent with cognitive psychology and contemporary neurobiology. In particular, I link imperfect perception to guided variations, like those contained in Dosi's technological paradigms. More generally, I attempt to integrate the evolutionary theory as conceived by Nelson and Winter with the evolutionary theory as conceived by Hayek.","authors":["Salvatore Rizzello"],"meta":["December 2002Metroeconomica 51(2):127 - 150","DOI:10.1111/1467-999X.00084"],"references":["24058202_Artificial_Worlds_and_Economics_Part_I","228776267_Evolutionary_economics_and_the_extension_of_evolution_to_the_economy"]}
