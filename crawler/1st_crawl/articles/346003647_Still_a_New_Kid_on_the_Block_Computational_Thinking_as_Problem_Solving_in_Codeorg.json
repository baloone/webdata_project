{"id":"346003647_Still_a_New_Kid_on_the_Block_Computational_Thinking_as_Problem_Solving_in_Codeorg","abstract":"Computational thinking is a means to understand and solve complex problems through using computer science concepts and techniques. While there is an increase in the number of initiatives focusing on coding, whether they (a) address computational thinking and problem-solving skills and (b) use methods of teaching problem solving is yet to be explored. As a preliminary step, this study focuses on examining 3rd grade lesson plans at Code.org. The analysis identified various components of computational thinking and problem solving as well as specific problem-solving teaching methods used to address these skills. Besides such cognitive outcomes, the findings also revealed affective, reflective, and social aspects of learning supported in the lessons.","authors":["Ugur Kale","Jiangmei Yuan"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Educational Computing Research 59(6)","DOI:10.1177/0735633120972050"],"references":["341402771_Relationships_between_Computational_Thinking_Skills_Ways_of_Thinking_and_Demographic_Variables_A_Structural_Equation_Modeling","337386137_Computational_Thinking_Mathematics_and_Science_Elementary_Teachers'_Perspectives_on_Integration","327382793_A_study_of_primary_school_students'_interest_collaboration_attitude_and_programming_empowerment_in_computational_thinking_education","325110126_Debugging_during_block-based_programming","324596211_Computational_What_Relating_Computational_Thinking_to_Teaching","303463820_Identifying_middle_school_students'_challenges_in_computational_thinking-based_science_learning","282603860_Computational_thinking_in_compulsory_education_Towards_an_agenda_for_research_and_practice","265855816_Learning_problem-solving_through_making_games_at_the_game_design_and_learning_summer_program","258134754_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Field","233824384_Problem_Solving_and_Computational_Thinking_in_a_Learning_Environment","220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","32957977_Content_Analysis_A_Flexible_Methodology","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","342406194_Focus-Fight-Finalize_3F_Problem-Solving_Steps_Extracted_From_Behavioral_Patterns_in_Block_Based_Programming","318350441_Reflective_abstraction_in_computational_thinking","317953648_Naturalistic_inquiry","312894224_Classical_content_analysis_A_review","309253979_Education_for_life_and_work_Developing_transferable_knowledge_and_skills_in_the_21st_century","305628802_From_computational_thinking_to_computational_participation_in_K--12_education","305193002_Learning_to_Solve_Problems_An_Instructional_Design_Guide","248437021_Naturalistic_inquiry_Beverly_Hills_CA_Sage_Publications_1985_416_pp_2500_Cloth","232564298_Problem-solving_transfer","226873200_Toward_a_Design_Theory_of_Problem_Solving","220017639_Content_Analysis_An_Introduction_To_Its_Methodology"]}
