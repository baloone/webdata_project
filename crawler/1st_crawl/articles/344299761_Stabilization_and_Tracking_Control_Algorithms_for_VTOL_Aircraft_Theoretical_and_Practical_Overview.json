{"id":"344299761_Stabilization_and_Tracking_Control_Algorithms_for_VTOL_Aircraft_Theoretical_and_Practical_Overview","abstract":"Control theory applied to multirotor aerial systems (MAS) has gained attention with the recent increase on the power computation for embedded systems. These systems are now able to perform the calculations needed for a variety of control techniques, with lower cost of sensors and actuators. These types of control algorithms are applied to the position and the attitude of MAS. In this paper, a brief overview evaluation of popular control algorithms for multirotor aerial systems, especially for VTOL-Vertical TakeOff and Landing aircraft, is presented. The main objective is to provide a unified and accessible analysis, placing the classical model of the VTOL vehicle and the studied control methods into a proper context. In addition, to provide the basis for beginner users working in aerial vehicles. In addition, this work contributes in presenting a comprehensive analysis of the implementation for the Nonlinear and Linear Backstepping, Nested Saturation and the Hyperbolic Bounded Controllers. These techniques are selected and compared to evaluate the performance of the aircraft, by simulations and experimental studies.","authors":["Julio Betancourt","Pedro Castillo Garcia","R.
