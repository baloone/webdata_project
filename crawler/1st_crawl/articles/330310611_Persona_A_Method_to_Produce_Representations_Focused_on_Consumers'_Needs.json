{"id":"330310611_Persona_A_Method_to_Produce_Representations_Focused_on_Consumers'_Needs","abstract":"At the beginning, ergonomics was aimed at adapting products for professionals working in the fields of safety, industry, aerospace, banks, health, etc. In other words, ergonomics was focused on qualified, skilled, and trained people who would often give us enough time to analyze their tasks, and understand their needs. Methods were employed which produced results that engineers and designers made operational while taking into account technical, time, and budgetary constraints. These methods are well known: task analysis, verbal protocol analysis, job analysis, subjective assessment, knowledge elicitation, accident reporting and analysis, mental workload assessment, etc.","authors":["Eric Brangier","Corinne Bornet"],"meta":["June 2011","DOI:10.1201/b10950-5","In book: Human Factors and Ergonomics in Consumer Product Design (pp.37-62)"],"references":["247913139_Activites_de_conception_et_creativite_de_l'analyse_des_facteurs_cognitifs_a_l'assistance_aux_activites_de_conception_creatives","221629534_Using_dramaturgical_methods_to_gain_more_dynamic_user_understanding_in_user-centered_design","221441576_From_user_to_character_an_investigation_into_user-descriptions_in_scenarios","221248300_Personas_in_Action_Ethnography_in_an_Interaction_Design_Team","215500610_Personas_From_Theory_to_Practices","51369194_The_Functional_Architecture_of_Human_Empathy","47802997_Persona_comme_outil_de_design_de_services_interactifs_principes_et_exemple_en_e-maintenance","10902889_Functional_imaging_of_'Theory_of_Mind'","282701026_Real_or_imaginary_The_effectiveness_of_using_personas_in_product_design","245154716_Exploring_design_options_for_interactive_video_with_the_Mnemovie_hypervideo_system","228594908_Personas_Participatory_Design_and_Product_Development_An_Infrastructure_for_Engagement","222301530_Evaluating_web_sites_Exploiting_user's_expectations","221517768_Making_personas_memorable","221096817_Personas_Layering_A_Cost_Effective_Model_for_Service_Design_in_Medium-Long_Term_Telco_Research_Projects","220054701_Fictional_characters_in_participatory_design_sessions_Introducing_the_design_alter_egos_technique","200827792_Personas_Practice_and_Theory","10634180_Limits_on_theory_of_mind_use_in_adults"]}
