{"id":"337360335_Recent_Approaches_of_Forecasting_and_Optimal_Economic_Dispatch_to_Overcome_Intermittency_of_Wind_and_Photovoltaic_PV_Systems_A_Review","abstract":"Renewable energy sources (RESs) are the replacement of fast depleting, environment polluting, costly, and unsustainable fossil fuels. RESs themselves have various issues such as variable supply towards the load during different periods, and mostly they are available at distant locations from load centers. This paper inspects forecasting techniques, employed to predict the RESs availability during different periods and considers the dispatch mechanisms for the supply, extracted from these resources. Firstly, we analyze the application of stochastic distributions especially the Weibull distribution (WD), for forecasting both wind and PV power potential, with and without incorporating neural networks (NN). Secondly, a review of the optimal economic dispatch (OED) of RES using particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. The reviewed techniques will be of great significance for system operators that require to gauge and pre-plan flexibility competence for their power systems to ensure practical and economical operation under high penetration of RESs.","authors":["Manzoor Ellahi","Ghulam Abbas","Irfan Khan","Paul Mario Koola"],"meta":["November 2019Energies 12(22):4392","DOI:10.3390/en12224392","Project: Self-Predictive Optimizing algorithm for Optimal Economic Dispatch of Renewable Energy Sources"],"references":["334049905_Intermittent_Renewable_Energy_Sources_The_Role_of_Energy_Storage_in_the_European_Power_System_of_2040","331094623_Optimal_Scheduling_of_Energy_Storage_Using_A_New_Priority-Based_Smart_Grid_Control_Method","330234472_Application_of_micro-grid_control_system_in_smart_park","328586893_A_Hybrid_Wind_Speed_Forecasting_Method_and_Wind_Energy_Resource_Analysis_Based_on_a_Swarm_Intelligence_Optimization_Algorithm_and_an_Artificial_Intelligence_Model","328323213_A_Short-Term_Wind_Speed_Forecasting_Model_by_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks_with_Stochastic_Optimization_for_Renewable_Energy_Systems","327796368_New_Monitoring_System_for_Photovoltaic_Power_Plants'_Management","337331516_Determination_of_Probability_Distribution_Function_for_Modelling_Global_Solar_Radiation_Case_Study_of_Ibadan_Nigeria","331551771_Energy_Storage_Systems_for_Intermittent_Renewable_Energy_Systems","330447032_A_Distributed_Coordination_Framework_for_Smart_Microgrids_From_Design_to_Laboratory-Scale_Implementation","328664650_How_to_deal_with_uncertainties_in_electric_power_systems_A_review"]}
