{"id":"221176335_Author_Name_Disambiguation_for_Citations_Using_Topic_and_Web_Correlation","abstract":"Today, bibliographic digital libraries play an important role in helping members of academic community search for novel research.\nIn particular, author disambiguation for citations is a major problem during the data integration and cleaning process, since\nauthor names are usually very ambiguous. For solving this problem, we proposed two kinds of correlations between citations,\nnamely, Topic Correlation and Web Correlation, to exploit relationships between citations, in order to identify whether two citations with the same author name refer to\nthe same individual.The topic correlation measures the similarity between research topics of two citations; while the Web\ncorrelation measures the number of co-occurrence in web pages. We employ a pair-wise grouping algorithm to group citations\ninto clusters. The results of experiments show that the disambiguation accuracy has great improvement when using topic correlation\nand Web correlation, and Web correlation provides stronger evidences about the authors of citations.","authors":["Kai-Hsiang Yang","Hsin-Tsung Peng","Jian-Yi Jiang","Hahn-Ming Lee"],"meta":["September 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-87599-4_19","SourceDBLP","Conference: Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, 12th European Conference, ECDL 2008, Aarhus, Denmark, September 14-19, 2008.
