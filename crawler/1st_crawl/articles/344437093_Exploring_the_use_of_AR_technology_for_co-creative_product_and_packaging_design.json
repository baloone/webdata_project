{"id":"344437093_Exploring_the_use_of_AR_technology_for_co-creative_product_and_packaging_design","abstract":"Extended Reality technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), are being applied in a wide variety of industrial applications, but their use within design practice remains very limited, despite some promising research activities in this area over the last 20 years. At the same time, design practice has been evolving to place greater emphasis on the role of the client or end-user in the design process through ‘co-creative design’ activities. Whilst offering many benefits, co-creative design activities also present challenges, notably in the communication between designers and non-designers, which can hinder innovation. \n\nIn this paper, we investigate the potential of a novel, projection-based AR system for the creation of design representations to support co-creative design sessions. The technology is tested through benchmarking experiments and in-situ trials conducted with two industrial partners. Performance metrics and qualitative feedback are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the new technology in supporting co-creative design sessions. Overall, AR technology allows quick, real-time modifications to the surfaces of a physical prototype to try out new ideas. Consequently, designers perceive the possibility to enhance the collaboration with the end-users participating in the session. Moreover, the quality and novelty of ideas generated whilst using projection-based AR outperform conventional sessions or handheld display AR sessions. Whilst the results of these early trials are not conclusive, the results suggest that projection-based AR design representations provide a promising approach to supporting co-creative design sessions.","authors":["Gaetano Cascini","Jamie O'Hare","Elies Dekoninck","Niccolò Becattini"],"meta":["December 2020Computers in Industry 123:17","DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2020.103308","Project: SPARK, SPatial Augmented Reality as a Key for co-creativity"],"references":["329091365_Defining_requirements_for_an_Augmented_Reality_system_to_overcome_the_challenges_of_creating_and_using_design_representations_in_co-design_sessions","325136664_Analysis_Of_Co-Design_Scenarios_And_Activities_For_The_Development_Of_A_Spatial_Augmented_Reality_Design_Platform","325134472_EXPLORING_THE_PERFORMANCE_OF_AUGMENTED_REALITY_TECHNOLOGIES_IN_CO-CREATIVE_SESSIONS_INITIAL_RESULTS_FROM_CONTROLLED_EXPERIMENTS","279867852_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality_Technologies_Applications_and_Limitations","273113031_Spatial_augmented_reality_for_product_appearance_design_evaluation","262851486_Probes_toolkits_and_prototypes_Three_approaches_to_making_in_codesigning","262046838_Quantifying_the_Creativity_Support_of_Digital_Tools_through_the_Creativity_Support_Index","259510225_Mutual_awareness_in_collaborative_design_An_Augmented_Reality_integrated_telepresence_system","228971468_A_user_study_of_interpretability_of_engineering_design_representations","225477822_Mixed_prototyping_for_product_assessment_A_reference_framework","221308699_DisplayObjects_Prototyping_functional_physical_interfaces_on_3D_styrofoam_paper_or_cardboard_models","220286331_The_anatomy_of_prototypes_Prototypes_as_filters_prototypes_as_manifestations_of_design_ideas","42796660_Against_Ambiguity","7454468_Augmented_Reality_Projects_in_the_Automotive_and_Aerospace_Industries","327992195_Situation-dependent_remote_AR_collaborations_Image-based_collaboration_using_a_3D_perspective_map_and_live_video-based_collaboration_with_a_synchronized_VR_mode","325138495_REAL-TIME_CODING_METHOD_FOR_CAPTURE_OF_ARTEFACT-CENTRIC_INTERACTIONS_IN_CO-CREATIVE_DESIGN_SESSIONS","324451137_Crowdsourcing_Augmented_Reality_Environment_CARE_for_aesthetic_evaluation_of_products_in_conceptual_stage","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","313819220_Developing_metrics_to_assess_technology-enabled_creative_co-design_sessions","313518502_Development_of_NASA-TLX_results_of_empirical_and_theoretical_research","290198147_A_comprehensive_survey_of_augmented_reality_assembly_research","284360249_The_effects_of_representation_on_idea_generation_and_design_fixation_A_study_comparing_sketches_and_function_trees","277564222_Connections_Between_the_Design_Tool_Design_Attributes_and_User_Preferences_in_Early_Stage_Design","268693375_AIR-MODELLING_A_tool_for_gesture-based_solid_modelling_in_context_during_early_design_stages_in_AR_environments","262275237_Sketch-Based_Interfaces_and_Modeling_SBIM_Investigating_three-dimensional_sketching_for_early_conceptual_design-Results_from_expert_discussions_and_user_studies","262255992_Validating_constraint_driven_design_techniques_in_spatial_augmented_reality","260289082_Design_Fixation_in_Physical_Modeling_An_Investigation_on_the_Role_of_Sunk_Cost","259099398_Augmented_and_Virtual_Reality_techniques_for_footwear","257001603_Mixed_prototyping_with_configurable_physical_archetype_for_usability_evaluation_of_product_interfaces","245588238_Boeing''s_Wire_Bundle_Assembly_Project","234776610_Understanding_Representation_in_Design","233691825_Virtual_reality_in_product_evaluations_with_potential_customers_An_exploratory_study_comparing_virtual_reality_with_conventional_product_representations","224189086_Exploring_the_Benefits_of_Augmented_Reality_Documentation_for_Maintenance_and_Repair","222672623_Metrics_for_measuring_ideation_effectiveness","221221375_Validating_Spatial_Augmented_Reality_for_interactive_rapid_prototyping","200085976_Development_of_NASA-TLX_Task_Load_Index_Results_of_empirical_and_theoretical_research","2418711_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality"]}
