{"id":"355382765_Computational_Aesthetics_of_Fine_Art_Paintings_The_State_of_the_Art_and_Outlook","abstract":"Fine art painting is an essential component of art. The computational aesthetics of fine art painting is a computable human aesthetic process realized by machines, which has significant application value and scientific significance in the automatic analysis of large-scale paintings and computational modeling for aesthetic. Given its interdisciplinary characteristics, for the first time, the computational aesthetics of fine art paintings is completely summarized into three aspects: Attribute recognition, content understanding, and aesthetic judgments according to the key processes of human aesthetics that include perception, cognition, and evaluation. The key scientific issues involved in each aspect are summarized, such as problem modeling, data acquisition, and frontier methods. Also, the three research contents of computational aesthetics of fine art painting are compared, and the future development of this field is discussed.","authors":["Y. Lu","C. Guo","Y.-L. Lin","F.
