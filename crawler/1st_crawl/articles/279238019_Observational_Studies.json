{"id":"279238019_Observational_Studies","abstract":"An observational study is a nonexperimental investigation of the effects caused by a treatment. Unlike an experiment, in an observational study, the investigator does not control the assignment of treatments, with the consequence that the individuals in different treatment groups may not have been comparable prior to treatment. Analytical adjustments, such as matching, are used to remove overt bias, that is, pretreatment differences that are accurately measured and recorded. There may be pretreatment differences that were not recorded, called hidden biases, and addressing these is a central concern.","authors":["Paul R Rosenbaum"],"meta":["January 2002","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4757-3692-2","Edition: 2ndPublisher: SpringerISBN: 978-1-4419-3191-7"],"references":["285355312_Methods_for_assessing_the_sensitivity_of_statistical_comparisons_used_in_Title_VII_cases_to_omitted_variables","16125748_Lead_absorption_in_children_of_employees_in_a_lead-related_industry","9761910_Statistical_criticism"]}
