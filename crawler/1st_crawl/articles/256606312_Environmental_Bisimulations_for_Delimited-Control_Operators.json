{"id":"256606312_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators","abstract":"We present a theory of environmental bisimilarity for the delimited-control\noperators {\\it shift} and {\\it reset}. We consider two different notions of\ncontextual equivalence: one that does not require the presence of a top-level\ncontrol delimiter when executing tested terms, and another one, fully\ncompatible with the original CPS semantics of shift and reset, that does. For\neach of them, we develop sound and complete environmental bisimilarities, and\nwe discuss up-to techniques.","authors":["Dariusz Biernacki","Sergue√Ø Lenglet"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-03542-0_24","SourcearXiv","Conference: Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems"],"references":["220997464_Extensional_normalisation_and_type-directed_partial_evaluation_for_typed_lambda_calculus_with_sums","220676492_A_monadic_framework_for_delimited_continuations","220606975_Axioms_for_control_operators_in_the_CPS_hierarchy","220370562_From_Applicative_to_Environmental_Bisimulation","50983437_Polymorphic_Delimited_Continuations","2846845_A_Sound_and_Complete_Axiomatization_of_Delimited_Continuations","1958398_An_Operational_Foundation_for_Delimited_Continuations_intheCPSHierarchy","261055522_A_Higher-Order_Distributed_Calculus_with_Name_Creation","243536627_X-calculus_models_of_programming_languages","223630020_A_bisimulation_for_dynamic_sealing","222687008_A_Co-Inductive_Proof_Method_for_Contextual_Properties_in_Untyped_l-Calculus_with_References_and_Deallocation","221947364_Fully_abstract_models_of_typed_l-calculi","221667118_Normal_Form_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators","221323189_The_Higher-Order_Call-by-Value_Applied_Pi-Calculus","221252244_Reasoning_with_Continuations_II_Full_Abstraction_for_Models_of_Control","220997548_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_First-Class_Prompts","220997492_Representing_Monads","220404737_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Higher-Order_Languages","51978342_Applicative_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators","4263860_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Higher-Order_Languages","2924765_Abstracting_Control","2788765_Syntactic_Abstraction_in_Scheme","2624704_A_Functional_Abstraction_of_Typed_Contexts","2484282_Reasoning_with_Continuations_II_Full_Abstraction_for_Models_of_Control"]}
