{"id":"308182610_Multidisciplinary_design_optimization_architecture_to_concurrent_design_of_satellite_systems","abstract":"The design of space systems is a complex and multidisciplinary process with multiple conflicting objectives, large number of design variables, and constraints that limits application of the existing multidisciplinary design optimization architectures to this class of design problems. This paper presents an enhanced multidisciplinary design optimization architecture to concurrent holistic design optimization of a satellite system. The proposed multidisciplinary design optimization architecture extends concepts of multidiscipline feasible and bi-level integrated system synthesis into a unified architecture using metamodels. The proposed architecture was evaluated and compared with the existing multidisciplinary design optimization architectures that include all-at-once, bi-level integrated system synthesis, and multidisciplinary design optimization using a remote sensing small satellite in low earth orbit. The satellite design optimization problem deals with the minimization of the total mass of the satellite, involving disciplines of mission analysis, payload, structures, attitude determination and control, communication, command and data handling, power and thermal. The computational performance and accuracy of the proposed architecture were compared with multidisciplinary design optimization benchmark problems. Then the proposed architecture is successfully applied to the satellite system design problem. The results obtained show that metamodel-based bi-level integrated system synthesis-multidisciplinary design optimization architecture presented in this paper provides an effective way of solving large-scale design problems.","authors":["Parviz Mohammad Zadeh","Mohadeseh Sadat Shirazi"],"meta":["September 2016Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part G Journal of Aerospace Engineering 231(10)","DOI:10.1177/0954410016665412"],"references":["286479775_Application_of_permutation_genetic_algorithm_for_sequential_model_building-model_validation_design_of_experiments","283039087_High_fidelity_multidisciplinary_design_optimization_of_a_wing_using_the_interaction_of_low_and_high_fidelity_models","253166227_Analytical_Target_Cascading_in_Aircraft_Design","251850665_Aircraft_Family_Design_Using_Decomposition-Based_Methods","246111886_Evaluation_of_Multidisciplinary_Optimization_Approaches_for_Aircraft_Conceptual_Design","241862709_A_surrogate_based_multistage-multilevel_optimization_procedure_for_multidisciplinary_design_optimization","235703327_Analytical_Target_Cascading_in_Automotive_Vehicle_Design","235703317_Target_Cascading_in_Vehicle_Redesign_A_Class_VI_Truck_Study","233927306_Target_cascading_in_optimal_system_design_J_Mech_Des_Trans_ASME","233861037_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization_A_Survey_of_Architectures","226148840_Application_of_the_optimal_Latin_hypercube_design_and_radial_basis_function_network_to_collaborative_optimization","225737347_Extension_of_the_Target_Cascading_Formulation_to_the_Design_of_Product_Families","225552086_Metamodel-based_collaborative_optimization_framework","225474702_On_the_development_of_Bi-Level_Integrated_System_Collaborative_Optimization","222112603_Benchmarking_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization_Algorithms","33984207_Target_cascading_in_optimal_system_design","2759746_Response_Surface_Based_Concurrent_Subspace_Optimization_For_Multidisciplinary_System_Design","344915469_Parameter_Identification_for_Nonlinear_Constitutive_Models_Finite_Element_Simulation_-_Optimization_-_Nontrivial_Experiments","287238030_Multidisciplinary_Design_and_Optimization_Methods","270236906_Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiment","269224426_An_analysis_of_collaborative_optimization_methods","268580525_Multi-Fidelity_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization_Based_on_Collaborative_Optimization_Framework","268477729_Numerical_Comparison_of_Multi-Level_Optimization_Techniques","268477139_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithm_Concurrent_Subspace_Optimization_MOGACSSO_for_Multidisciplinary_Design","268316575_Modelling_and_Approximation_Strategies_in_Optimization_-_Global_and_Mid-Range_Approximations_Response_Surface_Methods_Genetic_Programming_Low_High_Fidelity_Models","259671749_Multi-Objective_Pareto_Concurrent_Subspace_Optimization_for_Multidisciplinary_Design","259234323_Collaborative_Optimization_Using_Response_Surface_Estimation","245425204_Bilevel_Integrated_System_Synthesis_for_Concurrent_and_Distributed_Processing","245424952_Bilevel_Integrated_System_Synthesis","242934608_Concurrent_Subspace_Optimization_Using_Design_Variable_Sharing_in_a_Distributed_Computing_Environment","239059337_Non-hierarchic_system_decomposition_in_structural_optimization","238038776_Analytical_and_Computational_Aspects_of_Collaborative_Optimization_for_Multidisciplinary_Design","234253912_Space_Mission_Analysis_and_Design","228718384_Multidisciplinary_design_optimization_-_Some_formal_methods_framework_requirements_and_application_to_vehicle_design","227167722_A_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization_Approach_For_High_Temperature_Aircraft_Engine_Components","227085212_Approximation_Concepts_for_Optimum_Structural_Design_-A_Review","225999243_Computational_study_of_a_nonhierarchical_decomposition_algorithm","225409954_Comparison_of_MDO_methods_with_mathematical_examples","225321285_A_method_to_improve_computational_efficiency_for_CSSO_and_BLISS","222430986_Analytic_target_cascading_in_simulation-based_building_design","220442792_On_Decomposition_Methods_for_a_Class_of_Partially_Separable_Nonlinear_Programs","36419135_Robust_Design_Optimization_Based_on_Metamodeling_Techniques","33709589_Collaborative_optimization_an_architecture_for_large-scale_distributed_design","27312970_Simultaneous_model_building_and_validation_with_uniform_designs_of_experiments","24326802_Optimization_by_decomposition_A_step_from_hierarchic_to_non-hierarchic_systems","24288463_Optimization_of_coupled_systems_A_critical_overview_of_approaches","24161495_Multidisciplinary_Optimization_Methods_for_Aircraft_Preliminary_Design","23875832_Analytical_and_Computational_Properties_of_Distributed_Approaches_to_MDO","4705682_Implementation_and_Performance_Issues_in_Collaborative_Optimization","4684408_On_options_for_interdisciplinary_analysis_and_design_optimization","2649710_Problem_Formulation_for_Multidisciplinary_Optimization","2293718_Mdo_Test_Suite_At_Nasa_Langley_Research_Center"]}
