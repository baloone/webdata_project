{"id":"320962643_Simulating_Colour_Vision_Deficiency_from_a_Spectral_Image","abstract":"People with colour vision deficiency (CVD) have difficulty seeing full colour contrast and can miss some of the features in a scene. As a part of universal design, researcher have been working on how to modify and enhance the colour of images in order to make them see the scene with good contrast. For this, it is important to know how the original colour image is seen by different individuals with CVD. This paper proposes a methodology to simulate accurate colour deficient images from a spectral image using cone sensitivity of different cases of deficiency. As the method enables generation of accurate colour deficient image, the methodology is believed to help better understand the limitations of colour vision deficiency and that in turn leads to the design and development of more effective imaging technologies for better and wider accessibility in the context of universal design.","authors":["Raju Shrestha"],"meta":["August 2016Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 229:392-401"],"references":["283110454_Spatial_Intensity_Channel_Replacement_Daltonization_SIChaRDa","278667357_Multispectral_imaging_Fast_acquisition_capability_extension_and_quality_evaluation","276455941_A_Content-Dependent_Naturalness-Preserving_Daltonization_Method_for_Dichromatic_and_Anomalous_Trichromatic_Color_Vision_Deficiencies","266163870_A_Model_for_Simulation_of_Color_Vision_Deficiency_and_A_Color_Contrast_Enhancement_Technique_for_Dichromats","262023860_Spectrogenic_imaging_A_novel_approach_to_multispectral_imaging_in_an_uncontrolled_environment","37683505_Intelligent_modification_for_the_daltonization_process_of_digitized_paintings","26501594_Quantification_and_Standardized_Description_of_Color_Vision_Deficiency_Caused_by_Anomalous_TrichromatsAAAPart_II_Modeling_and_Color_Compensation","285188941_Standard_response_functions_for_protanopic_and_deuteranopic_vision","264376074_Defective_Colour_Vision","262317044_So_that's_what_you_see_building_understanding_with_personalized_simulations_of_colour_vision_deficiency"]}
