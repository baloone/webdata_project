{"id":"282570965_Classification_of_Programming_Tasks_According_to_Required_Skills_and_Knowledge_Representation","abstract":"Tasks represent a central part of computer science lessons, and aim to practice programming skills or to concrete abstract concepts for example. We have investigated, which types of tasks are given to novice programmers, typically. For that purpose, we have analyzed and generalized tasks from textbooks and exercise sheets. The result is a list of twelve task types classified according to required skills and knowledge representation. In addition, we found that the task types differ very much regarding their incidence. Finally, we tried to relate the three found forms of knowledge representation to concepts of cognitive psychology.","authors":["Alexander Ruf","Marc Berges","Peter Hubwieser"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25396-1_6","Conference: 8th International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution, and Perspectives"],"references":["289805286_Type_of_questions_-_The_case_of_computer_science","277177235_Didaktisches_System_fur_objektorientiertes_Modellieren_im_Informatikunterricht_der_Sekundarstufe_II","262198228_Types_of_Assignments_for_Novice_Programmers","250144949_Gender_Differences_in_Types_of_Assignments_Preferred_Implications_for_Computer_Science_Instruction","245032114_Concept_specification_maps_-_Displaying_content_structures","274970033_Note_to_self","266992922_Guide_to_teaching_computer_science_An_activity-based_approach","264234775_Informatik_II_Objektorientierte_Modellierung","245104165_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_revision_of_Bloom''s_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objec","242542592_Karel_the_robot_a_gentle_introduction_to_the_art_of_programming_second_edition","233869626_Towards_an_overview_map_of_object-oriented_programming_and_design","233869624_Computer_Science_Education_in_Secondary_Schools_--_The_Introduction_of_a_New_Compulsory_Subject","235465787_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives","234781951_Getting_More_Oomph_from_Programming_Exercises","230595759_Java_How_to_Program"]}
