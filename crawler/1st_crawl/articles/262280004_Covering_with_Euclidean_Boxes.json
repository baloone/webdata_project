{"id":"262280004_Covering_with_Euclidean_Boxes","abstract":"Parallelopipeds of the d -dimensional Euclidean space ℝ d with faces parallel to the axes are called boxes and box( p , q ) denotes the intersection of all boxes containing the points p , q ∈ ℝ d . Here we prove the existence of a constant c depending only on d such that any compact set V ⊂ ℝ d has a subset of cardinality at most c which induces a box-cover of V , that is V ⊂ ∪ p,g ∈ S box( p , q ). That result is used to derive further covering theorems in combinatorial geometry and hypergraph theory.","authors":["Imre Bárány","Jeno Lehel"],"meta":["April 1987European Journal of Combinatorics 8(2):113-119","DOI:10.1016/S0195-6698(87)80001-X"],"references":["313218100_The_Computation_of_Fixed_Points_and_Applications","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","268833465_Sous_Les_Paves","265370143_A_Hellytype_problem_in_trees","265350821_The_Computation_of_Fixed_Points_and_Applications","262202637_An_extension_of_the_Erdos-Szekers_theorem_on_large_angles","242792931_Monochromatic_paths_in_edge-colored_graphs","225885151_A_Ramsey-type_problem_in_directed_and_bipartite_graphs","225529698_Hypergraph_families_with_bounded_edge_cover_or_transversal_number","225135158_On_the_structure_of_linear_graphs","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs"]}
