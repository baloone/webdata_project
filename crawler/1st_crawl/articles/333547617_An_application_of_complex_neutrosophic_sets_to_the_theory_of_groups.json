{"id":"333547617_An_application_of_complex_neutrosophic_sets_to_the_theory_of_groups","abstract":"In this article we introduce the concept of complex neutrosophıc subgroups (normal subgroups). We define the notion of alpha-cut of complex neutrosophıc set, give examples and study some of its related results. We also define the Cartesian product of complex neutrosophic subgroups. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of image and preimage of complex neutrosophic set and prove some of its properties.","authors":["Muhammad Gulistan","Amir Abdullah","Florentin Smarandache"],"meta":["November 2018International Journal of Algebra and Statistics 7(1-2)","DOI:10.20454/ijas.2018.1455","Project: Cubic sets and generalizations"],"references":["301346438_Complex_neutrosophic_set","262047656_Single_valued_neutrosophic_sets","258391930_Complex_Atanassov's_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Relation","287455637_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_groups_induced_by_t_s-norm","283811887_An_approach_to_neutrosophic_subgroup_and_its_fundamental_properties","258045048_Fuzzy_groups","256992299_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst","229092085_Operation_properties_and_-equalities_of_complex_fuzzy_sets","222878484_Fuzzy_complex_numbers","222385773_Turksen_LB_Interval_valued_fuzzy_sets_based_on_normal_forms_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst_80_191-210"]}
