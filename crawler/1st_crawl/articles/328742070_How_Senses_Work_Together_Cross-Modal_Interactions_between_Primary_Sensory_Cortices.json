{"id":"328742070_How_Senses_Work_Together_Cross-Modal_Interactions_between_Primary_Sensory_Cortices","abstract":"On our way through a town, the things we see can make us change the way we go. The things that we hear can make us stop or walk on, or the things we feel can cause us to wear a warm jacket or just a t-shirt. All these behaviors are mediated by highly complex processing mechanisms in our brain and reflect responses to many important sensory inputs. The mammalian cerebral cortex, which processes the sensory information consists of largely specialized sensory areas mainly receiving information from their corresponding sensory modalities. The first cortical regions receiving the input from the outer world are the so called primary sensory cortices. Strikingly, there is convincing evidence that primary sensory cortices do not work in isolation but are substantially affected by other sensory modalities. Here we will review previous and current literature on this cross-modal interplay.","authors":["Manuel Teichert","Jurgen Bolz"],"meta":["December 2018Neural Plasticity 2018","DOI:10.1155/2018/5380921"],"references":["328132017_Cross-modal_Restoration_of_Juvenile-like_Ocular_Dominance_Plasticity_after_Increasing_GABAergic_Inhibition","327872745_Cross-Modal_Reinstatement_of_Thalamocortical_Plasticity_Accelerates_Ocular_Dominance_Plasticity_in_Adult_Mice","324569289_Visual_Performance_in_Mice_Physiology_meets_behavior","324543208_Cross-modal_restoration_of_ocular_dominance_plasticity_in_adult_mice","323155310_Visual_Information_Present_in_Infragranular_Layers_of_Mouse_Auditory_Cortex","321861114_Cross-modal_refinement_of_visual_performance_after_brief_somatosensory_deprivation_in_adult_mice","321637197_Homeostatic_plasticity_and_synaptic_scaling_in_the_adult_mouse_auditory_cortex","319420487_Data_on_the_effect_of_conductive_hearing_loss_on_auditory_and_visual_cortex_activity_revealed_by_intrinsic_signal_imaging","319009339_Audio-visual_modulation_in_mouse_V1_depends_on_cross-modal_stimulus_configuration_and_congruency","318568521_Simultaneous_intrinsic_signal_imaging_of_auditory_and_visual_cortex_reveals_profound_effects_of_acute_hearing_loss_on_visual_processing"]}
