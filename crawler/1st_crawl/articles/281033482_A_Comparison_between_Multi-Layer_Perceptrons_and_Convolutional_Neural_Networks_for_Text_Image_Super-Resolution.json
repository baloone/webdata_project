{"id":"281033482_A_Comparison_between_Multi-Layer_Perceptrons_and_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Text_Image_Super-Resolution","abstract":"We compare the performances of several Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for single text image Super-Resolution. We propose an example-based framework for both MLP and ConvNet, where a non-linear mapping between pairs of patches and high-frequency pixel values is learned. We then demonstrate that for equivalent complexity, ConvNets are better than MLPs at predicting missing details in upsampled text images. To evaluate the performances, we make use of a recent database (ULR-textSISR-2013a) along with different quality measures. We show that the proposed methods outperforms sparse coding-based methods for this database.","authors":["Cl√©ment Peyrard","Franck Mamalet","Christophe Garcia"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.5220/0005297200840091","Conference: VISAPP 2015At: Berlin"],"references":["277517347_Real-Time_Document_Image_Super-Resolution_by_Fast_Matting","272031125_Super-resolution_A_comprehensive_survey","271554920_Restricted_Boltzmann_machine_approach_to_couple_dictionary_training_for_image_super-resolution","239762638_Local_Consistency_Constrained_Adaptive_Neighbor_Embedding_for_Text_Image_Super-Resolution","319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","284182774_Efficient_Example-Based_Super-Resolution_of_Single_Text_Images_Based_on_Selective_Patch_Processing","262323537_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution","262226002_A_Statistical_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Sparse_Representations_for_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","262211450_High-Frequency_Restoration_Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_for_Super-resolution","260580330_New_image_super-resolution_scheme_based_on_residual_error_restoration_by_neural_networks"]}
