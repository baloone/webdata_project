{"id":"302292616_Modern_and_Postmodern_Metaphors_of_Self_Mind_and_Memory","abstract":"Throughout the history of psychology, metaphors have been used to describe and explain psychological phenomena. The term metaphor derives from the Greek word “metapherein” which means to transfer the quality of one entity to another (Peavy, 1993, p. 11). While discourse on metaphor can be traced to Aristotle (330 B. C./1924), the role that metaphor is believed to play in relating to and understanding the external world is viewed very differently from modern and postmodern perspectives. Modernist thinkers, for example, have viewed metaphors as a stylistic form of speech or simile that is used to make comparisons. Consequently, within the modernist tradition, metaphors are often described as mere ornaments of language and not a constitutive part of language and understanding. By way of contrast, postmodern scholars suggest that metaphors are basic to understanding, and consequently that they are not so much a form of speech but rather a fundamental form of thought (Leary, 1990). For instance, scientists and linguistics such as Black (1962), Gould (1983), Kuhn (1993), Lakoff and Johnson (1980) have studied the way in which metaphors function as a constitutive part of communication as well as of scientific inquiry. When viewed as a constitutive aspect of language, metaphors actively contribute to our understanding of experience rather than “merely” being mirrors that reflect reality. Thus postmodern scholars suggest that perceived realities may change as the metaphors used to understand “reality” change.","authors":["George Schreiner","William J.
