{"id":"282692604_Distance-2_MDS_Codes_and_Latin_Colorings_in_the_Doob_Graphs","abstract":"The maximum independent sets in the Doob graphs D(m,n) are analogs of the\ndistance-2 MDS codes in Hamming graphs and of the latin hypercubes. We prove\nthe characterization of these sets stating that every such set is semilinear or\nreducible. As related objects, we study vertex sets with maximum cut (edge\nboundary) in D(m,n) and prove some facts on their structure. We show that the\nconsidered two classes (the maximum independent sets and the maximum-cut sets)\ncan be defined as classes of completely regular sets with specified 2-by-2\nquotient matrices. It is notable that for a set from the considered classes,\nthe eigenvalues of the quotient matrix are the maximum and the minimum\neigenvalues of the graph. For D(m,0), we show the existence of a third,\nintermediate, class of completely regular sets with the same property.","authors":["Denis S Krotov","Evgeny Bespalov"],"meta":["September 2018Graphs and Combinatorics 34(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-018-1926-4","SourcearXiv","Project: Codes in Doob gaphs"],"references":["290889865_On_the_number_of_maximum_independent_sets_in_Doob_graphs","257912722_On_extensions_of_partial_n-quasigroups_of_order_4","235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","45883427_Arithmetic_completely_regular_codes","286512838_MDS_codes_in_the_Doob_graphs","261254007_Perfect_colorings_of_the_12-cube_that_attain_the_bound_on_correlation_immunity","237640100_A_bound_on_correlation_immunity","233932988_Distance-Regular_Graphs","226604246_On_r-partition_designs_in_Hamming_spaces","225473293_Perfect_2-colorings_of_hypercube","2213305_n-Ary_Quasigroups_of_Order_4","2127723_Asymptotics_for_the_number_of_n-quasigroups_of_order_4","29600581_On_r-partition_designs_in_hamming_spaces","2129470_On_reducibility_of_n-ary_quasigroups","2122376_On_decomposability_of_4-ary_distance_2_MDS_codes_double-codes_and_n-quasigroups_of_order_4"]}
