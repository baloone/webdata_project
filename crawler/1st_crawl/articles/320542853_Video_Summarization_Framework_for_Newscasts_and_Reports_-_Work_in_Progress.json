{"id":"320542853_Video_Summarization_Framework_for_Newscasts_and_Reports_-_Work_in_Progress","abstract":"This paper presents a framework for summarization for newscasts and reports, that is a part of an ongoing research towards multilingual opinion analysis system conducted under the CHIST-ERA project “Access Multilingual Information opinionS” (AMIS). We present the results of qualitative analysis of newscast and reports published in the Internet by leading English, French and Arabic TV channels. We show the method used for creation of a database that contains 300 h of such content on controversial topics. Finally, we show the design and operation of our summarization framework. The framework is designed in such a way, that it allows for easy experimentation with different approaches to video summarization. The description is followed by a presentation of high- and low-level metadata extraction algorithms that include detection of the anchorperson, recognition of day and night shots and extraction of low-level video quality indicators.","authors":["Mikołaj Igor Leszczuk","Michał Grega","Arian Koźbiał","Jarosław Gliwski"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69911-0_7","Conference: International Conference on Multimedia Communications, Services and Security","Project: AMIS:  Access Multilingual Information opinionS"],"references":["311624010_Software_package_for_measurement_of_quality_indicators_working_in_no-reference_model","254024970_Perceptual_quality_assessment_for_H264AVC_compression","242233577_Framework_for_the_Integrated_Video_Quality_Assessment","220905684_Accuracy_vs_Speed_Trade-Off_in_Detecting_of_Shots_in_Video_Content_for_Abstracting_Digital_Video_Libraries","51903487_Algorithm_for_Video_Summarization_of_Bronchoscopy_Procedures","3940582_Rapid_Object_Detection_using_a_Boosted_Cascade_of_Simple_Features","240224936_Rapid_object_detection_using_a_boosted_cascade_of_simple_features","224591811_Modeling_subjective_tests_of_quality_of_experience_with_a_Generalized_Linear_Model","222337229_An_integrated_system_for_content-based_video_retrieval_and_browsing","221571226_Video_Parsing_Retrieval_and_Browsing_An_Integrated_and_Content-Based_Solution"]}
