{"id":"1913681_Fast_Unfolding_of_Communities_in_Large_Networks","abstract":"We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our\nmethod is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to\noutperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time.\nMoreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the\nso-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian\nmobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million\nnodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad\nhoc modular networks.","authors":["Vincent D.
