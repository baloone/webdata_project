{"id":"224248869_Performance_Analysis_of_Cloud_Computing_Centers_Using_MGmmr_Queuing_Systems","abstract":"Successful development of cloud computing paradigm necessitates accurate performance evaluation of cloud data centers. In this paper we describe a novel analytical model for performance evaluation of cloud server farms and solve it to obtain important performance indicators such as mean number of tasks in the system, blocking probability, and probability of immediate service, as well as the complete probability distribution of the request response time. This model allows cloud operators to determine the relationship between the number of servers and/or input buffer size, on one side, and the values of blocking probability and probability that a task request will obtain immediate service, on the other.","authors":["Hamzeh Khazaei","Jelena Mišić","Vojislav Misic"],"meta":["May 2012IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 23(99):1 - 1","DOI:10.1109/TPDS.2011.199","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["266416071_Performance_Analysis_of_Cloud_Computing_Centers","261457614_Availability_Analysis_of_Cloud_Computing_Centers","305981546_Approximations_for_the_steady-state_probabilities_in_the_MGc_queue","305978439_Approximations_in_finite-capacity_multi-server_queues_by_Poisson_arrivals","305978323_Customer_average_and_time_average_queue_lengths_and_waiting_times","305975732_Approximation_of_the_queue-length_distribution_of_an_MGIs_queue_by_the_basic_equations","265682047_Customer_Average_and_Time_Average_Queue_Lengths_and_Waiting_Times","265458990_Probability_and_Random_Processes","248767384_Probability_and_Random_Processes","245468831_Approximations_for_the_MGm_Queue"]}
