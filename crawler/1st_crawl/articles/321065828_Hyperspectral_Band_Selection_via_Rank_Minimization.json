{"id":"321065828_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_via_Rank_Minimization","abstract":"Band selection is an important preprocessing technique for hyperspectral imagery, through which a subset of critical and representative spectral bands can be selected from a raw image cube for compact yet effect representation. Among the valid selection strategies, performing band selection in an unsupervised manner is usually considered more general due to its application-independent characteristic. This letter proposed a novel unsupervised hyperspectral band selector that can capture the interband redundancy nature of hyperspectral images through low-rank modeling. Experiments on three real-world hyperspectral data sets demonstrated that the proposed band selector can generate band subsets suitable in the context of hyperspectral pixel classification.","authors":["Zhu Guokang","Yuancheng Huang","Shuying Li","Jun Tang"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters PP(99):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2017.2763183"],"references":["262772218_A_Fast_Volume-Gradient-Based_Band_Selection_Method_for_Hyperspectral_Image","262391178_Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso","260800451_Structured_Priors_for_Sparse-Representation-Based_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","258836693_Nature-Inspired_Framework_for_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection","224342471_Similarity-Based_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Analysis","3205663_Clustering-Based_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Using_Information_Measures","3204105_Constrained_band_selection_for_hyperspectral_imagery","320094124_Locality_Adaptive_Discriminant_Analysis_for_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images","311396907_Hyperspectral_Imaging_Techniques_for_Spectral_Detection_and_Classification","309776972_Squaring_weighted_low-rank_subspace_clustering_for_hyperspectral_image_band_selection","308819806_A_novel_hyperspectral_image_anomaly_detection_method_based_on_low_rank_representation","308807260_Hyperspectral_image_classification_with_low-rank_subspace_and_sparse_representation","302204208_On_the_mean_accuracy_of_statistical_pattern_recognizers","298902600_Salient_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_via_Manifold_Ranking","282546574_Unsupervised_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Dominant_Set_Extraction","282531833_Robust_Kernel_Low-Rank_Representation","275256889_Band_Selection_Using_Improved_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery_Classification","265968186_Collaborative_Representation_for_Hyperspectral_Anomaly_Detection","264743775_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Multitask_Sparsity_Pursuit","261113001_Hyperspectral_image_compressed_sensing_via_low-rank_and_joint-sparse_matrix_recovery","260711623_Progressive_Band_Selection_of_Spectral_Unmixing_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","260502075_Graph-Regularized_Low-Rank_Representation_for_Destriping_of_Hyperspectral_Images","221344982_Robust_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Low-Rank_Representation","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","3421219_Supervised_classification_in_high-dimensional_space_Geometrical_statistical_and_asymptotical_properties_of_multivariate_data"]}
