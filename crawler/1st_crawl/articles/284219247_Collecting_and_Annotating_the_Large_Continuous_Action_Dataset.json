{"id":"284219247_Collecting_and_Annotating_the_Large_Continuous_Action_Dataset","abstract":"We make available to the community a new dataset to support\naction-recognition research. This dataset is different from prior datasets in\nseveral key ways. It is significantly larger. It contains streaming video with\nlong segments containing multiple action occurrences that often overlap in\nspace and/or time. All actions were filmed in the same collection of\nbackgrounds so that background gives little clue as to action class. We had\nfive humans replicate the annotation of temporal extent of action occurrences\nlabeled with their class and measured a surprisingly low level of intercoder\nagreement. A baseline experiment shows that recent state-of-the-art methods\nperform poorly on this dataset. This suggests that this will be a challenging\ndataset to foster advances in action-recognition research. This manuscript\nserves to describe the novel content and characteristics of the LCA dataset,\npresent the design decisions made when filming the dataset, and document the\nnovel methods employed to annotate the dataset.","authors":["Daniel Paul Barrett","Ran Xu","Haonan Yu","Jeffrey Siskind"],"meta":["October 2016Machine Vision and Applications 27(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00138-016-0768-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["314874420_Robust_Subspace_Estimation_Using_Low-Rank_Optimization","313245185_Discriminative_subvolume_search_for_efficient_action_detection","310842565_Action_MACH_A_spatio-temporal_maximum_average_correlation_height_filter_for_action_recognition","308807116_A_discriminative_CNN_video_representation_for_event_detection","300408292_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_with_3D_Convolutional_Networks","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","286127111_Generating_natural-language_video_descriptions_using_text-mined_knowledge","284562463_Action_Recognition_by_Time-Series_of_Retinotopic_Appearance_and_Motion_Features","282310627_Segment-Phrase_Table_for_Semantic_Segmentation_Visual_Entailment_and_Paraphrasing"]}
