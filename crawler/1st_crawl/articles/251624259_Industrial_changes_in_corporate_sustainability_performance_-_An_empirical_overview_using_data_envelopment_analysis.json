The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the SAM Group. All of the corporate sustainability indicators used in the present study were developed independently from the original data provided by the SAM Group by the authors of this article. Any possible errors in the interpretation of the data remain the sole responsibility of the authors. conducted at the industry-level. The aim of the study was to determine the change in corporate sustainability performance over time. A composite index of corporate sustainability performance was created using DEA relative efficiency scores in sixteen industries, and the changes in efficiency were measured using the Malmquist index for three consecutive years. The findings indicate that sustainability performance varies across industries and reflect a trend of on-going improvement in corporate sustainability performance in most industries. Of the 16 industries, 7 industries have improved their sustainability performance consistently during the three consecutive years. The natural resources sector tends to have more consistent and stable sustainability performance than the other sectors.","authors":["Dong-shang Chang","Li-chin Regina Kuo","Yi-Tui
