{"id":"326075089_Bees_Algorithm_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Time_Windows","abstract":"This paper presents the bees algorithm for vehicle routing problems within time windows (VRPTW). The VRPTW aims to determine the optimal route for a number of vehicles when serving a set of customers within a predefined time interval (the time window). The objective in VRPTW is to minimize overall transportation cost. Various heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been developed in literature to produce high-quality solutions for this problem because of its high complication rate and extensive implementation in real-life applications. This research investigates the use of bee algorithms (BA) for VRPTW and identifying the strengths and weaknesses.
