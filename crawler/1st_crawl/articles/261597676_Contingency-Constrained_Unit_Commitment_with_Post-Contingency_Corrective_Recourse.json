{"id":"261597676_Contingency-Constrained_Unit_Commitment_with_Post-Contingency_Corrective_Recourse","abstract":"We consider the problem of minimizing costs in the generation unit commitment\nproblem, a cornerstone in electric power system operations, while enforcing an\nN-k-e reliability criterion. This reliability criterion is a generalization of\nthe well-known $N$-$k$ criterion, and dictates that at least $(1-e_ j)$\nfraction of the total system demand must be met following the failures of $k$\nor fewer system components. We refer to this problem as the\nContingency-Constrained Unit Commitment problem, or CCUC. We present a\nmixed-integer programming formulation of the CCUC that accounts for both\ntransmission and generation element failures. We propose novel cutting plane\nalgorithms that avoid the need to explicitly consider an exponential number of\ncontingencies. Computational studies are performed on several IEEE test systems\nand a simplified model of the Western US interconnection network, which\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods relative to current\nstate-of-the-art.","authors":["Richard Li-Yang Chen","Neng Fan","Ali Pinar","Jean-Paul Watson"],"meta":["February 2017Annals of Operations Research 249(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-014-1760-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257794984_Optimal_power_flow_a_bibliographic_survey_II","257794983_Optimal_power_flow_a_bibliographic_survey_I","317415393_Power_generation_operation_and_control","291317896_Energy_and_reserve_scheduling_under_an_N-K_security_criterion_via_robust_optimization","272969162_Power_generation_operation_and_control_-_2nd_Edition","263048080_The_Next_Generation_of_Unit_Commitment_Models","260509643_Two-Stage_Robust_Optimization_for_N_-k_Contingency-Constrained_Unit_Commitment","260509631_Vulnerability_Analysis_of_Power_Grids_With_Line_Switching","259137417_Optimal_power_grid_protection_through_a_defender-attacker-defender_model","257516145_The_unit_commitment_model_with_concave_emissions_costs_A_hybrid_Benders'_Decomposition_with_nonconvex_master_problems"]}
