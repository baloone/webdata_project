This article proposes a review of the main work conducted at an international level these past years on factors encouraging or hindering autonomy and social participation of persons with an intellectual deficiency. It seems that adaptative skills constitute a prerequisite for successful educational, social and professional integration, and it is therefore necessary to design tools and systems making it possible to develop them.","authors":["Jacques Bouchand"],"meta":["January 2013La nouvelle revue - Éducation et société inclusives 63(3):167","DOI:10.3917/nras.063.0167"],"references":["228683527_The_Exchangeability_of_IQs_Implications_for_Professional_Psychology","51865734_Strengths_and_weaknesses_in_executive_functioning_in_children_with_intellectual_disability","45798772_Executive_functions_in_individuals_with_intellectual_disability","26713034_Public_Policy_and_the_Enhancement_of_Desired_Outcomes_for_Persons_With_Intellectual_Disability","26260392_Characteristics_and_Needs_of_People_With_Intellectual_Disability_Who_Have_Higher_IQs","8588555_Ethical_Analysis_of_the_Concept_of_Disability","6917751_A_comparison_of_mainstream_and_special_education_for_teenagers_with_Down_syndrome_Implications_for_parents_and_teachers","5645380_Predictors_of_academic_attainments_of_young_people_with_Down's_syndrome","287177754_Disability_Rights_and_Wrongs","249835087_Academic_and_Social_Attainments_of_Children_with_Mental_Retardation_in_General_Education_and_Special_Education_Settings","240287359_Functional_Life_Skills_Curricular_Interventions_for_Youth_With_DisabilitiesA_Systematic_Review","233973878_Evaluation_of_An_Activities_of_Daily_Living_Scale_for_Adolescents_and_Adults_with_Developmental_Disabilities","230782431_Using_iPods_R_and_iPads_R_in_teaching_programs_for_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities_A_systematic_review","229300843_La_reeducation_cognitive","228060941_Still_a_Health_Issue","222023436_Analytical_creative_and_practical_intelligence_as_predictors_of_self-reported_adaptive_functioning_A_case_study_in_Russia","216007015_Handbook_of_Intellectual_and_Developmental_Disabilities","49811763_Outcome_Evaluation_of_Active_Support_Training_in_Taiwan","46133051_Supported_Employment_for_People_with_Intellectual_Disability_The_Effects_of_Job_Breakdown_on_Psychological_Well-Being","24305621_Outcomes_in_Different_Residential_Settings_for_People_With_Intellectual_Disability_A_Systematic_Review","23226880_A_comparison_of_the_social_competence_of_children_with_moderate_intellectual_disability_in_inclusive_versus_segregated_school_settings","23218732_Active_support_A_critical_review_and_commentary","7967271_Patterns_of_employment_and_independent_living_of_adult_graduates_with_learning_disabilities_and_mental_retardation_of_an_inclusionary_high_school_vocational_program","7000520_Deinstitutionalisation_and_community_living_Progress_problems_and_priorities","6591559_The_role_of_cognition_and_adaptive_behavior_in_employment_of_people_with_mental_retardation","5398147_Activity_limitations_among_young_adults_with_developmental_disabilities_A_population-based_follow-up_study"]}
