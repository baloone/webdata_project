{"id":"346764545_Analogicity_in_Computer_Science_Methodological_Analysis","abstract":"Analogicity in computer science is understood in two, not mutually exclusive ways: 1) with regard to the continuity feature (of data or computations), 2) with regard to the analogousness feature (i.e. similarity between certain natural processes and computations). Continuous computations are the subject of three methodological questions considered in the paper: 1a) to what extent do their theoretical models go beyond the model of the universal Turing machine (defining digital computations), 1b) is their computational power greater than that of the universal Turing machine, 1c) under what conditions are continuous computations realizable in practice? The analogue-analogical computations lead to two other issues: 2a) in what sense and to what extent their accuracy depends on the adequacy of certain theories of empirical sciences, 2b) are there analogue-analogical computations in nature that are also continuous? The above issues are an important element of the philosophical discussion on the limitations of contemporary computer science.","authors":["Pawe≈Ç Stacewicz"],"meta":["September 2020Studies in Logic 63(1):69-86","DOI:10.2478/slgr-2020-0028"],"references":["332568219_From_Computer_Science_to_the_Informational_Worldview_Philosophical_Interpretations_of_Some_Computer_Science_Concepts","315437614_Computing_as_Empirical_Science_-_Evolution_of_a_Concept","326720589_O_roznych_sposobach_rozumienia_analogowosci_w_informatyce","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","279958039_Artificial_Intelligence","257051024_The_Extended_Analog_Computer","246964414_Non-Turing_Computers_and_Non-Turing_Computability","243775087_Mathematical_theory_of_the_differential_analyzer","243772509_Neural_Networks_and_Analog_Computation_Beyond_the_Turing_Limit","239578559_Turing_AM_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungs_problem_Proc_Lond_Math_Soc_Ser_2_42_230-265","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","236631125_Handbook_of_Natural_Computing","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","222561733_Analog_computers_and_recursive_functions_over_the_reals","222476328_Recursion_Theory_on_the_Reals_and_Continuous-Time_Computation"]}
