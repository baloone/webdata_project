{"id":"303503739_Tertiary_student_attitudes_to_invigilated_online_summative_examinations","abstract":"The outcomes of a trial implementation of an invigilated, online examination at a regional university in Australia and their implications for online education providers are discussed. Students in a first year online psychology course were offered the opportunity to complete their final examination task online with invigilation conducted via webcam. About a quarter of the students (125) initially elected to complete the online examination; however, after they had undertaken a practice online examination, only 29 (6.3 %) students elected to continue in the trial and proceed to take the final exam online. The study concluded that many students have substantial challenges with the idea of major stakes examinations being online. While lower associated costs and time requirements were motivations, many were challenged by the process due to technical difficulties and insufficient support. ICT infrastructure and reliable connectivity remain significant barriers to successful completion of online examinations under secure, proctored conditions.","authors":["Rosalind James"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1186/s41239-016-0015-0"],"references":["345760163_A_Multidimensional_Scaling_of_College_Students'_Perceptions_of_Academic_Dishonesty","307631852_Assessment's_place_in_the_new_MOOC_world","289417707_Mastering_the_Online_Summative-Assessment_Life_Cycle","286568301_Dishonesty_deterrence_and_detection_How_technology_can_ensure_distance_learning_test_security_and_validity","283405096_Cost-effectiveness_of_online_education","281830485_Kryterion_Online_Examination_Software_Trial_Evaluation_of_Student_Experience_P072_Online_Examination_Trial_Project_Final_Report_February_2012","281673778_Unsupervised_online_constructed-response_tests_Maximising_student_learning_and_results_integrity","277222724_Point_Click_and_Cheat_Frequency_and_Type_of_Academic_Dishonesty_in_the_Virtual_Classroom","266178317_Preventing_Online_Cheating_with_Technology_A_Pilot_Study_of_Remote_Proctor_and_an_Update_of_Its_Use","263488269_Sophisticated_tasks_in_e-assessment_What_are_they_and_what_are_their_benefits"]}
