{"id":"291437388_Integrity_Constraints_for_General-Purpose_Knowledge_Bases","abstract":"Integrity constraints in databases have been studied extensively since the\n1980s, and they are considered essential to guarantee database integrity. In\nrecent years, several authors have studied how the same notion can be adapted\nto reasoning frameworks, in such a way that they achieve the purpose of\nguaranteeing a system's consistency, but are kept separate from the reasoning\nmechanisms.\nIn this paper we focus on multi-context systems, a general-purpose framework\nfor combining heterogeneous reasoning systems, enhancing them with a notion of\nintegrity constraints that generalizes the corresponding concept in the\ndatabase world.","authors":["Lu√≠s Cruz-Filipe","Isabel Nunes","Peter Schneider-Kamp"],"meta":["August 2018Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 83(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10472-018-9577-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["318224357_Semantics_for_Active_Integrity_Constraints_Using_Approximation_Fixpoint_Theory","282906517_repAIrC_A_Tool_for_Ensuring_Data_Consistency_-_By_Means_of_Active_Integrity_Constraints","273896784_Grounded_fixpoints_and_their_applications_in_knowledge_representation","326432312_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_OWL_and_Relational_Databases","312719871_Information_Flow_within_Relational_Multi-context_Systems","312660913_Integrity_Constraints_for_General-Purpose_Knowledge_Bases","308361569_Active_Integrity_Constraints_for_Multi-Context_Systems","305440373_Grounded_Fixpoints_and_Active_Integrity_Constraints","282676588_Evolving_multi-context_systems","282318011_Distributed_Evaluation_of_Nonmonotonic_Multi-context_Systems"]}
