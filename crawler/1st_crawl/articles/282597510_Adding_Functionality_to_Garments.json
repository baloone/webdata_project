{"id":"282597510_Adding_Functionality_to_Garments","abstract":"Consumers expect the garments they buy to meet a multiplicity of end use and wear conditions, and this means manufacturers need to build functionality, or multifunctionality, into the garments they produce. This chapter discusses the ways in which various functionalities, such as retention of appearance, durability, comfort, handle and tailorability can be enhanced in garments. The tests used to assess and quantify the different functionalities are described.","authors":["L. Hunter","J.
