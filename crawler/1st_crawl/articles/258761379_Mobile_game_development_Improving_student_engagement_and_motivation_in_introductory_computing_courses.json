{"id":"258761379_Mobile_game_development_Improving_student_engagement_and_motivation_in_introductory_computing_courses","abstract":"Computer games have been accepted as an engaging and motivating tool in the CS curriculum. However, designing and implementing a playable game is challenging and is best done in advanced courses. Games for mobile devices, on the other hand, offer the advantage of being simpler and, thus, easier to program for lower-level students. Learning context of mobile game development can be used to reinforce many core programming topics, such as loops, classes and arrays. Furthermore, it can also be used to expose students in introductory computing courses to a wide range of advanced topics in order to illustrate that CS can be much more than coding. This paper describes the authorâ€™s experience with using mobile game development projects in CS I and II, how these projects were integrated into existing courses at several universities, and the lessons learned from this experience.","authors":["Stan A Kurkovsky"],"meta":["June 2013Computer Science Education 23(2):138-157","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2013.777236"],"references":["346493719_Augmented_Learning_Research_and_Design_of_Mobile_Educational_Games","345768288_Influence_of_Social_Interaction_on_Cognition_Connected_Learning_in_Science","344718519_Session_details_Computer_games_in_the_classroom_or_how_to_get_perfect_attendance_even_at_8_am","311472375_Experiencing_aspects_of_games_programming_in_an_introductory_computer_graphics_class","311465220_Games_stories_or_something_more_traditional_the_types_of_assignments_college_students_prefer","277436510_Games_as_a_flavor_of_CS1","275714433_Women's_Way_of_Knowing_The_Development_of_Self_Voice_and_Mind","275435703_Introductory_game_creation","271689705_Influence_of_Social_Interaction_on_Cognition_Connected_Learning_in_Science","270200131_Knowing_and_Reasoning_in_College_Gender-Related_Patterns_in_Students'_Intellectual_Development","262175066_Short_mobile_game_development_projects_for_introductory_CS_courses_conference_workshop","255601159_Using_XNA-GSE_Game_Segments_to_Engage_Students_in_Advanced_Computer_Science_Education","270009951_Women's_Ways_of_Knowing_The_Development_of_Self_Voice_and_Mind","262392995_Teaching_computing_for_everyone","262165591_Games_as_a_flavor_of_CS1"]}
