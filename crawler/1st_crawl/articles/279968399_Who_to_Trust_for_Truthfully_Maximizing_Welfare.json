{"id":"279968399_Who_to_Trust_for_Truthfully_Maximizing_Welfare","abstract":"We introduce a general approach based on \\emph{selective verification} and\nobtain approximate mechanisms without money for maximizing the social welfare\nin the general domain of utilitarian voting. Having a good allocation in mind,\na mechanism with verification selects few critical agents and detects, using a\nverification oracle, whether they have reported truthfully. If yes, the\nmechanism produces the desired allocation. Otherwise, the mechanism ignores any\nmisreports and proceeds with the remaining agents. We obtain randomized\ntruthful (or almost truthful) mechanisms without money that verify only $O(\\ln\nm / \\epsilon)$ agents, where $m$ is the number of outcomes, independently of\nthe total number of agents, and are $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximate for the social\nwelfare. We also show that any truthful mechanism with a constant approximation\nratio needs to verify $\\Omega(\\log m)$ agents. A remarkable property of our\nmechanisms is \\emph{robustness}, namely that their outcome depends only on the\nreports of the truthful agents.","authors":["Dimitris Fotakis","Christos Tzamos","Emmanouil Zampetakis"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257246600_Combinatorial_Auctions_Without_Money","241764114_Price_Discrimination_Through_Communication","241623206_Mechanism_design_From_partial_to_probabilistic_verification","228115487_On_the_Power_of_Deterministic_Mechanisms_for_Facility_Location_Games","227300491_The_Power_of_Verification_for_One-Parameter_Agents","286244155_Optimal_Allocation_with_Costly_Verification","282470636_Truthfulness_Flooded_Domains_and_the_Power_of_Verification_for_Mechanism_Design","268019959_The_Design_of_Approximation_Algorithms","262294123_Mechanism_design_for_fair_division_Allocating_divisible_items_without_payments","247153032_Truthful_Approximations_to_Range_Voting"]}
