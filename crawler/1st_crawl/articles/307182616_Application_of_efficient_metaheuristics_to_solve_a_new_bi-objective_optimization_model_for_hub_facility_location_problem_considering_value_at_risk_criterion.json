In addition, the second objective\nminimizes total costs of the network. Furthermore, some constraints\nare nonlinear in this model and it is aimed to linearize\nthem by efficient approximate procedures. This paper tries\nto apply three efficient solution procedures to solve the biobjective\nmodel. Thus, three algorithms are Îµ -constraint,\nnon-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and\nmulti-objective particle swarm optimizers (MOPSO) which\nare creativity ways used in this paper to approximate the\nPareto-optimal solutions. Taguchi experimental design is\nused to find the right parameter settings for metaheuristic\nalgorithms. A comparative study of three proposed algorithms\ndemonstrates the most effectiveness algorithm with\nrespect to five existing performance measures for numerous\ntest problems. Finally, the comparison within each two algorithms\nis completed by applying multiple statistical tests and\ndiagrams. The obtained solutions by MOPSO are better than\nNSGA-II at 95% confidence level.","authors":["V. R.
