{"id":"338249354_Gamification_Applied_in_Computer_Science_Education_A_Preliminary_Approach","abstract":"This paper presents a preliminary approach for implementing a gamification-based system that can be used by the bachelor’s degree program students from our faculty in order to improve their computer science learning experience. Based on the state-of-art elements specific to gamification and on a briefly literature review of the existing gamification platforms and studies related to its efficiency when it comes to learning computer science, we identified a platform, in the name of Kahoot, that can be used as a preliminary step in our gamification approach. The obtained results and the students’ feedback look promising and open the door for future additions and improvements.","authors":["Bogdan Iancu"],"meta":["September 2019","DOI:10.12948/ei2019.01.06"],"references":["345959032_Gamification-based_e-learning_Platform_for_Computer_Programming_Education","272151679_Study_of_Gamification_Effectiveness_in_Online_e-Learning_Systems","271647254_Gamification_of_MOOCs_for_Increasing_User_Engagement","265789392_Gamification_for_Engaging_Computer_Science_Students_in_Learning_Activities_A_Case_Study","262395542_An_experience_report_on_using_gamification_in_technical_higher_education","230854710_From_Game_Design_Elements_to_Gamefulness_Defining_Gamification","315403667_Learning_a_Language_for_Free_While_Translating_the_Web_Does_Duolingo_Work","271298075_Engaging_Computer_Science_Students_through_Gamification_in_an_Online_Social_Network_Based_Collaborative_Learning_Environment","265852843_Gamification_in_software_engineering_-_A_systematic_mapping","261844724_A_case_study_in_the_gamification_of_a_university-level_games_development_course"]}
