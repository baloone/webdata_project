{"id":"281475703_Design_of_processing_system_for_agricultural_pests_with_digital_signal_processor","abstract":"In order to solve the problem of weak real-time in the pest identification and calculate the number of agricultural pests, it is necessary to design an agricultural recognition system of pests with digital signal processor. The hardware system includes the curtain for collecting pests, H-shaped mobile platform, and recognition hardware system for agricultural pests. The software system consists of image segmentation based on single-threshold segmentation, and mathematical morphology de-noising, and pests edge extraction according to wavelet transformation, and pest counting based on a closed curve. The rice plant-hopper is used as an example. The video camera is applied to shoot crop video. The images are input video signal to the recognition system, and identify the image of rice planthoppers. These algorithms run in the recognition system that can achieve real-time identification requirements, and provide a basis for further identification of the pest.","authors":["X. Zou","W.
