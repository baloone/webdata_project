{"id":"343128561_Writing_for_Journal_Publications_A_Case_Study_of_Eight_Computer_Scientists_in_Algeria","abstract":"Journal publications written in English are a sina qua non condition for national and international recognition. Recent literature in applied linguistics and other fields has denounced the existence of some conventions and “rules” that govern a given research writing. That is, using a concise, clear and error-free language is demanded in order to increase accessibility and ease of understanding. With the aid of textual descriptive analysis, this paper attempts to review the most common linguistic reasons behind papers’ rejection. Eight papers of Ph.D. computer science students were collected and analyzed qualitatively in order to diagnose the main problems and challenges Ph.D. students face while writing for scholarly publication. Other than other linguistic lacunes, it is found out that the authors had problems mainly with using the right tone, choosing the correct words and the adequate tense use. Indeed, the results of this study are supposed to be of some use to writers who want to know what writing conventions, if there are any, are adequate for paper publication. Finally, some recommendations related to students’ problems in writing for scholarly publication are made.","authors":["Anissa Cheriguene","Kebbache Tayeb","Chaker Abdelaziz Kerrache"],"meta":["July 2020Arab World English Journal 6:102-113","DOI:10.24093/awej/call6.7"],"references":["352005969_A_CASE_STUDY_CORPUS_FOR_ACADEMIC_ENGLISH_WRITING_BY_NNS_AUTHORS","336652665_Improving_Students'_Scientific_Writing_Ability_through_Blended_learning-Based_Collaborative_Learning","329547095_Linguistic_Injustice_in_the_Writing_of_Research_Articles_in_English_as_a_Second_Language_Data_From_Taiwanese_and_Mexican_Researchers","323316382_New_Data_on_the_Linguistic_Diversity_of_Authorship_in_Philosophy_Journals","272657857_Lexical_errors_in_second_language_scientific_writing_Some_conceptual_implications","333480824_'The_constant_rejections_hurt'_Skills_and_personal_attributes_needed_to_successfully_complete_a_thesis_by_publication","333042107_The_dominance_of_english_as_a_language_of_science_Effects_on_other_languages_and_language_communities","327722932_WASP_Write_a_Scientific_Paper_Structuring_a_scientific_paper","283601236_Writing_without_conviction_Hedging_in_research_articles","275689251_Boosting_hedging_and_the_negotiation_of_academic_knowledge","233660049_The_dominance_of_English_in_the_international_scientific_periodical_literature_and_the_future_of_language_use_in_science","265229604_Contemporary_Business_Communication","240920269_Native_speaker_performance_validity_In_vain_or_for_gain","235342105_The_Dominance_of_English_as_a_Language_of_Science_Effects_on_Other_Languages_and_Language_Communities","223891035_Scientific_publishing_in_developing_countries_Challenges_for_the_future"]}
