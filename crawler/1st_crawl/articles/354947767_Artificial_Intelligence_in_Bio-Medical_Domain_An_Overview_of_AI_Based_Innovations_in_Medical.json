{"id":"354947767_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Bio-Medical_Domain_An_Overview_of_AI_Based_Innovations_in_Medical","abstract":"In this era and in the future, artificially intelligent machines are replacing and playing a key role to enhance human capabilities in many areas. It is also making life style better by providing convenience to all including normal human beings and professionals as well. That is why AI is gaining huge attention and popularity in the field of computer science by which it has revolutionized the rapidly growing technology known as expert system. The applications of AI are working in many areas with huge impact and being used widely as well. AI provides quality and efficiency in almost every area, we are evolving it in. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the area of medical and health-care with respect to AI along with 'Machine Learning', and 'Neural Networks'. This work explores the current use of AI in innovations, in the particular field of Bio-Medical and evaluated that how it has improved hospital inpatient care and other sectors related to it i.e. smart medical home, virtual presence of doctors and patients, automation in diagnostic, etc. that has changed the infrastructure of medical domain. Finally, an investigation of some expert systems and applications is made. These systems and applications are widely used throughout the world and a ranking mechanism of their performance has proposed accordingly in an organized manner. We hope, this work will be helpful for the researchers coming to this particular area and to provide a syntactic information that how computer science (i.e. AI, ANN, ML) is revolutionizing the field of bio-medical and healthcare.","authors":["Muhammad Salman","Abdul Wahab Ahmed","Ahmad Khan","Basit Raza"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 8(8):319-327"],"references":["315631443_Automatic_matching_of_surgeries_to_predict_surgeons'_next_actions","327189856_Healthcare_Information_Management_Systems","311164171_Adapting_to_Artificial_Intelligence_Radiologists_and_Pathologists_as_Information_Specialists","310486284_A_Review_on_Big_Data_Security_and_Privacy_in_Healthcare_Applications","310239212_From_stay_to_play_-_A_travel_planning_tool_based_on_crowdsourcing_user-generated_contents","305672199_Overview_of_Clinical_Decision_Support_Systems","295894144_Animating_eco-education_To_see_feel_and_discover_in_an_augmented_reality-based_experiential_learning_environment","295098079_Applied_artificial_intelligence_and_trust-The_case_of_autonomous_vehicles_and_medical_assistance_devices","293237224_The_location_of_health_centers_in_a_rural_region_using_a_decision_support_system_a_Zambian_case_study","287769074_A_survey_on_artificial_intelligence_approaches_for_medical_image_classification"]}
