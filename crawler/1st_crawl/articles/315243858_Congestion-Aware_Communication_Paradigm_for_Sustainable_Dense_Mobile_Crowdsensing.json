{"id":"315243858_Congestion-Aware_Communication_Paradigm_for_Sustainable_Dense_Mobile_Crowdsensing","abstract":"Mobile crowdsensing, as an emerging sensing paradigm, relies significantly on wireless communication networks to provide QoS guaranteed data transmission among smartphone users on phenomena of common interest. The explosively growing number and varieties of smartphones impose heavy burdens on the communication infrastructures of mobile crowdsensing. The communication performance of crowdsensing may deteriorate in some high-density areas due to the overwhelming communication requests, while the wireless bandwidth in other areas may not be fully utilized with sporadic and infrequent communication requests. Therefore, it is of great necessity to consider the imbalanced utilization of wireless resources in the design of a communication paradigm in mobile crowdsensing to meet the stringent QoS requirements. To this end, in this article we propose a congestion-aware communication paradigm for sustainable dense mobile crowdsensing in order to achieve efficient load balancing and reliable communication in mobile crowdsensing.","authors":["Wen Sun","Jiajia Liu"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Communications Magazine 55(3):62-67","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600742CM"],"references":["280696068_When_Crowdsourcing_Meets_Mobile_Sensing_A_Social_Network_Perspective","260189250_Surface_Coverage_in_Sensor_Networks","254464487_Crowdsourcing_to_smartphones_Incentive_mechanism_design_for_mobile_phone_sensing","284765420_Participatory_Sensing_Meets_Opportunistic_Sharing_Automatic_Phone-to-Phone_Communication_in_Vehicles","283227724_An_incentive-based_evolutionary_algorithm_for_participatory_sensing","276398009_Collaborative_Recognition_of_Queuing_Behavior_on_Mobile_Phones","264561848_Opportunities_in_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing","264561564_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_in_Space_Weather_Monitoring_The_Mahali_Project","262204646_Lowering_the_barriers_to_large-scale_mobile_crowdsensing","241770553_How_Long_to_Wait_Predicting_Bus_Arrival_Time_With_Mobile_Phone_Based_Participatory_Sensing","221037294_Sell_your_experiences_A_market_mechanism_based_incentive_for_participatory_sensing"]}
