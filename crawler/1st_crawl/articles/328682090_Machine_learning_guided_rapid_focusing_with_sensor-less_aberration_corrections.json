{"id":"328682090_Machine_learning_guided_rapid_focusing_with_sensor-less_aberration_corrections","abstract":"Non-invasive, real-time imaging and deep focus into tissue are in high demand in biomedical research. However, the aberration that is introduced by the refractive index inhomogeneity of biological tissue hinders the way forward. A rapid focusing with sensor-less aberration corrections, based on machine learning, is demonstrated in this paper. The proposed method applies the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can rapidly calculate the low-order aberrations from the point spread function images with Zernike modes after training. The results show that approximately 90 percent correction accuracy can be achieved. The average mean square error of each Zernike coefficient in 200 repetitions is 0.06. Furthermore, the aberration induced by 1-mm-thick phantom samples and 300-Âµm-thick mouse brain slices can be efficiently compensated through loading a compensation phase on an adaptive element placed at the back-pupil plane. The phase reconstruction requires less than 0.2 s. Therefore, this method offers great potential for in vivo real-time imaging in biological science.","authors":["Yuncheng Jin","Yiye Zhang","Lejia Hu","Haiyang Huang"],"meta":["November 2018Optics Express 26(23):30162","DOI:10.1364/OE.26.030162"],"references":["324549998_Deep_learning_massively_accelerates_super-resolution_localization_microscopy","316955101_Deep_Learning_Microscopy","316184521_Deep_Learning_for_Photoacoustic_Tomography_from_Sparse_Data","278718197_Adaptive_optical_microscopy_The_ongoing_quest_for_a_perfect_image","278331390_Direct_wavefront_sensing_for_high-resolution_in_vivo_imaging_in_scattering_tissue","260153683_Direct_phase_measurement_in_zonal_wavefront_reconstruction_using_multidither_coherent_optical_adaptive_technique","46034145_Shack-Hartmann_wavefront-sensor-based_adaptive_optics_system_for_microscopy","40786338_Adaptive_optics_via_pupil_segmentation_for_high-resolution_imaging_in_biological_tissues","5784569_Closed-loop_aberration_correction_using_a_modal_Zernike_wavefront_sensor","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","323114545_Adaptive_optical_microscopy_for_neurobiology","315913177_Adaptive_optical_fluorescence_microscopy","315898179_In_vivo_imaging_of_neural_activity","310122378_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Inverse_Problems_in_Imaging","304665464_Accelerating_magnetic_resonance_imaging_via_deep_learning","304006163_Interferometric_method_for_phase_calibration_in_liquid_crystal_spatial_light_modulators_using_a_self-generated_diffraction-grating","281666966_Guidestar-assisted_wavefront-shaping_methods_for_focusing_light_into_biological_tissue","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","259241634_Adaptive_Optics_for_Astronomical_Telescopes","229407982_A_wavefront_sensor-less_adaptive_optical_system_for_a_solid-state_laser","221725167_Wave-front_estimation_from_wave-front_slope_measurements"]}
