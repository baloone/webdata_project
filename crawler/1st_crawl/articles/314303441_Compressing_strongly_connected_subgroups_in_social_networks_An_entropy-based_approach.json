{"id":"314303441_Compressing_strongly_connected_subgroups_in_social_networks_An_entropy-based_approach","abstract":"To detect and study cohesive subgroups of actors is a main objective in social network analysis. What are the respective relations inside such groups and what separates them from the outside. Entropy-based analysis of network structures is an up-and-coming approach. It turns out to be a powerful instrument to detect certain forms of cohesive subgroups and to compress them to superactors without loss of information about their embeddedness in the net: Compressing strongly connected subgroups leaves the whole net’s and the (super-)actors’ information theoretical indices unchanged; i.e., such compression is information-invariant. The actual article relates on the reduction of networks with hundreds of actors. All entropy-based calculations are realized in an expert system shell.","authors":["Dominic Brenner","Andreas Dellnitz","Friedhelm Kulmann","Wilhelm Rödder"],"meta":["March 2017Journal of Mathematical Sociology 41(2):84-103","DOI:10.1080/0022250X.2017.1284070"],"references":["281367392_Opinion_Dynamics_and_the_Evolution_of_Social_Power_in_Influence_Networks","260344711_Social_Network_Analysis_for_Information_Flow_in_Disconnected_Delay-Tolerant_MANETs","235437090_Entropy_Production_in_Stationary_Social_Networks","222538101_Centrality_and_Network_Flow","221404350_Optimal_junction_Trees","221366745_Reflections_on_Logic_and_Probability_in_the_Context_of_Conditionals","51944496_Information_Transfer_in_Social_Media","316793638_Strukturanalyse_sozialer_Netzwerke","313073813_Local_Computations_with_Probabilities_on_Graphical_Structures_and_Their_Application_to_Expert_Systems","304374264_Centrality_in_social_networks_Conceptual_clarification","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","264349959_Entropy_based_evaluation_of_net_structures_-_Deployed_in_Social_Network_Analysis","251879806_Networks_and_Political_Process","249954506_From_Information_to_Probability_An_Axiomatic_Approach","232548298_Who_shall_survive_A_new_approach_to_the_problem_of_human_interrelations_Nervous_and_mental_disease_monograph_series_no_58","229068400_The_Acquaintance_Process","226393627_Discovering_Sets_of_Key_Players_in_Social_Networks","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","222662586_Entropy_as_a_measure_of_centrality_in_networks_characterized_by_path-transfer_flow","222447730_Centrality_in_Social_Networks'_Conceptual_Clarification","221023174_Probabilistic_models_for_discovering_e-communities","220815043_Knowledge_Processing_under_Information_Fidelity","220688047_Conditionals_in_Nonmonotonic_Reasoning_and_Belief_Revision_-_Considering_Conditionals_as_Agents","220545767_Characterizing_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Cross-Entropy_Within_a_Conditional-Logical_Framework","220314770_Recall_and_Reasoning-an_information_theoretical_model_of_cognitive_processes","220063234_From_information_to_probability_An_axiomatic_approachInference_is_information_processing","216636713_Eigenvector-Like_Measures_of_Centrality_for_Asymmetric_Relations","216634004_Social_Network_Analysis_Methods_And_Applications","202187111_Die_Regeln_der_soziologischen_Methode","200110868_Discovering_important_nodes_through_graph_entropy_the_case_of_Enron_email_database","38362523_I-Divergence_Geometry_of_Probability_Distributions_and_Minimization_Problems","31398459_Features_of_the_expert-system-shell_SPIRIT","6375717_An_Information-Theoretic_Framework_for_Resolving_Community_Structure_in_Complex_Networks","3083296_Axiomatic_Derivation_of_the_Principle_of_Maximum_Entropy_and_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Cross-Entropy"]}
