{"id":"225522247_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","abstract":"The Tutte polynomial is a notoriously hard graph invariant, and efficient algorithms for it are known only for a few special\ngraph classes, like for those of bounded tree-width. The notion of clique-width extends the definition of cograhs (graphs\nwithout induced P\n4), and it is a more general notion than that of tree-width. We show a subexponential algorithm (running in time expO(n\n2/3)) for computing the Tutte polynomial on cographs. The algorithm can be extended to a subexponential algorithm computing the\nTutte polynomial on on all graphs of bounded clique-width. In fact, our algorithm computes the more general U-polynomial.\n\n2000 Math Subjects Classification: 05C85, 68R10.\n\nKeywordsTutte polynomial-cographs-clique-width-subexponential algorithm-\nU polynomial","authors":["Omer Gim√©nez","Petr Hlineny","Marc Noy"],"meta":["December 2005","DOI:10.1007/11604686_6","Conference: Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science"],"references":["227323313_Approximating_Rank-Width_and_Clique-Width_Quickly","226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","222354208_An_algorithm_for_the_Tutte_polynomials_of_graphs_of_bounded_treewidth","220753023_Approximating_Rank-Width_and_Clique-Width_Quickly","344904542_The_Theory_of_Partitions","239066782_A_weighted_graph_polynomial_from_chromatic_invariants_of_knots","231831212_On_the_computational_complexity_of_the_Jones_and_Tutte_polynomials","223529096_Edge_dominating_set_and_colorings_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","222434550_Approximating_clique-width_and_branch-width","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs"]}
