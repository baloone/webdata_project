{"id":"318550766_The_Frobenius_FFT","abstract":"Let Fq be the finite field with q elements and let ω be a primitive n-th root of unity in an extension field Fqd of Fq. Given a polynomial P ∈ Fq [x] of degree less than n, we will show that its discrete Fourier transform (P (ω⁰), ..., P (ωn - 1)) ∈ Fqdⁿ can be computed essentially d times faster than the discrete Fourier transform of a polynomial Q ∈ Fqd [x] of degree less than n, in many cases. This result is achieved by exploiting the symmetries provided by the Frobenius automorphism of Fqd over Fq.","authors":["Joris van der Hoeven","Robin Larrieu"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1145/3087604.3087633","Conference: Proceedings of the 42th international symposium on symbolic and algebraic computation"],"references":["325041552_Modular_composition_via_factorization","305455665_Fast_Polynomial_Multiplication_over_F_260","263930025_Faster_Polynomial_Multiplication_over_Finite_Fields","318550683_The_Truncated_Fourier_Transform_for_Mixed_Radices","311556588_Algorithm_for_the_machine_calculation_of_complex_Fourier_series","287932314_Highly_composite_numbers_by_srinivasa_ramanujan","267004817_Computational_Complexity","265616982_An_Equivariant_Fast_Fourier_Transform_Algorithm","265426627_Highly_composite_numbers_Annotated_by_Jean-Louis_Nicolas_and_Guy_Robin","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra"]}
