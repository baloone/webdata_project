{"id":"241739256_Influences_on_Students'_Choice_of_College_Major","abstract":"In this study, the authors surveyed undergraduate students at a large northeastern business school concerning influences on their choices of major. The authors examined factors such as why students initially select particular majors and which positive and negative factors relate to any later changes in those choices. Results show that interest in the subject was the most important factor for incoming freshmen, regardless of gender. For women, the next most influential factor was aptitude in the subject. However, men were significantly more influenced by the major's potential for career advancement and job opportunities and the level of compensation in the field. Students appeared to be driven to change their major because of positive factors about the new major, rather than negative factors related to the old major.","authors":["Charles Malgwi","Martha A.
