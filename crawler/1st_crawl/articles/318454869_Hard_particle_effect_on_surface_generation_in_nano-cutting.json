{"id":"318454869_Hard_particle_effect_on_surface_generation_in_nano-cutting","abstract":"The influence of the hard particle on the surface generation, plastic deformation and processing forces in nano-cutting of aluminum is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations. In this investigation, a hard particle which is simplified as a diamond ball is embedded under the free surface of workpiece with different depths. The influence of the position of the hard ball on the surface generation and other material removal mechanism, such as the movement of the ball under the action of cutting tool edge, is revealed. The results show that when the hard particle is removed, only a small shallow pit is left on the machined surface. Otherwise, it is pressed down to the subsurface of the workpiece left larger and deeper pit on the generated surface. Besides that, the hard particle in the workpiece would increase the processing force when the cutting tool edge or the plastic carriers interact with the hard particle. It is helpful to optimize the cutting parameters and material properties for obtaining better surface quality in nano-cutting of composites or other materials with micro/nanoscale hard particles in it.","authors":["Feifei Xu","Fengzhou Fang","Xiaodong Zhang"],"meta":["July 2017Applied Surface Science 425","DOI:10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.07.089"],"references":["317911476_A_finite_element_analysis_of_the_orthogonal_cutting_of_SiCpAl_composites_Effects_of_particle_fracture_and_tool-particle_relative_location","317784691_Sequence_analysis_of_chromosome_1_revealed_different_selection_patterns_between_Chinese_wild_mice_and_laboratory_strains","317389498_Side_Flow_Effect_on_Surface_Generation_in_Nano_Cutting","316345598_Study_on_Crystallographic_Orientation_Effect_on_Surface_Generation_of_Aluminum_in_Nano-cutting","312337354_A_study_on_the_tool_edge_geometry_effect_on_nano-cutting","281589434_Effect_of_cutting_parameters_on_heat_generation_in_ultra-precision_milling_of_aluminum_alloy_6061","259085302_Recent_advances_in_modelling_of_metal_machining_processes","258851915_Nano-scale_machining_of_polycrystalline_coppers_-_effects_of_grain_size_and_machining_parameters","257399705_Study_on_critical_rake_angle_in_nanometric_cutting","256114682_Anisotropy_of_Single_Crystal_3C-SiC_during_Nanometric_Cutting","234068130_Study_on_nanometric_cutting_of_germanium_by_molecular_dynamics_simulation","233953533_Automated_identification_and_indexing_of_dislocations_in_crystal_interfaces","232103146_Atomistic_investigation_of_scratching-induced_deformation_twinning_in_nanocrystalline_Cu","222823911_Precision_machining_of_microstructures_on_electroless-plated_NiP_surface_for_molding_glass_components","303423892_The_effects_of_pore_and_second-phase_particle_on_the_mechanical_properties_of_machining_copper_matrix_from_molecular_dynamic_simulation","300408137_Origins_for_the_size_effect_of_surface_roughness_in_diamond_turning","298329278_A_molecular_dynamics_investigation_into_plastic_deformation_mechanism_of_nanocrystalline_copper_for_different_nanoscratching_rates","287507576_Study_of_nanoindentation_mechanical_response_of_nanocrystalline_structures_using_molecular_dynamics_simulations","281544730_A_review_of_surface_roughness_generation_in_ultra-precision_machining","272487930_Fast_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Short-Range_Molecular_Dynamics","271604109_A_study_of_the_performance_of_cutting_polycrystalline_Al_6061_T6_with_single_crystalline_diamond_micro-tools","261528586_Latitude_drives_diversification_in_Madagascar's_endemic_dry_forest_rodent_Eliurus_myoxinus_subfamily_Nesomyinae","260007840_Effect_of_material_microstructure_and_tool_geometry_on_surface_generation_in_single_point_diamond_turning","256673338_Structure_of_Micromachined_Surface_Simulated_by_Molecular_Dynamics_Analysis","251509267_A_study_of_the_cutting_performance_of_poly-crystalline_oxygen_free_copper_with_single_crystalline_diamond_micro-tools","245226930_Modelling_of_Material_Side_Flow_in_Hard_Turning","245096378_Modeling_and_experimental_investigation_on_nanometric_cutting_of_monocrystalline_silicon","240380896_Nano-turning_of_single_crystal_silicon","235556709_Intrinsic_long-range_bond-order_potential_for_carbon_Performance_in_Monte_Carlo_simulations_of_graphitization","231407213_Molecular-Dynamics_Study_of_Melting_and_Freezing_of_Small_Lennard-Jones_Clusters","231147987_The_effects_of_hard_particles_on_the_surface_quality_when_micro-cutting_aluminum_6061_T6","231135238_Machining_with_micro-size_single_crystalline_diamond_tools_fabricated_by_a_focused_ion_beam","229313850_Effect_of_Crystallographic_Orientation_on_Cutting_Forces_and_Surface_Quality_in_Diamond_Cutting_of_Single_Crystal","229293416_Workpiece_surface_quality_when_ultra-precision_turning_of_SiCpAl_composites","229230863_Mechanism_of_Micro_Chip_Formation_in_Diamond_Turning_of_Al-Mg_Alloy","229085177_Visualization_and_Analysis_of_Atomistic_Simulation_Data_with_OVITO_-_the_Open_Visualization_Tool","222914356_Effect_of_plastic_side_flow_on_surface_roughness_in_micro-turning_process","222682969_Molecular_dynamics_simulations_on_nanoindentation_mechanisms_of_multilayered_films","222646224_Atomic_scale_structure_of_sputtered_metal_multilayers","222159290_Feasibility_Study_on_Ultimate_Accuracy_in_Microcutting_Using_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation"]}
