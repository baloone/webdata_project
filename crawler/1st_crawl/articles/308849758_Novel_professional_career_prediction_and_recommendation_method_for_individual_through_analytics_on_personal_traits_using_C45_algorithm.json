{"id":"308849758_Novel_professional_career_prediction_and_recommendation_method_for_individual_through_analytics_on_personal_traits_using_C45_algorithm","abstract":"The awareness of choosing the right option for career is increasing among the students. The students fail to know their strengths and choose career randomly which leads to frustration and demoralization. The automated systems used by the counsellors are to evaluate the personality traits of the individual. The accuracy of prediction depends on the set of relevant skill parameters and analytics on these., The research in view to design the accurate prediction and recommendation systems shows use of mining and statistical algorithms. In this work we propose the improved accuracy approach for prediction where C4.5 algorithm for rules generation and applying statistical correlation on the results.","authors":["Lokesh S Katore","Bhakti S Ratnaparkhi","Jitendra Umale"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1109/GCCT.2015.7342798","Conference: 2015 Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT)"],"references":["228641079_Why_do_IQ_scores_predict_job_performance_An_alternative_sociological_explanation","273310225_Comparative_Study_of_Recommendation_Algorithms_and_Systems_using_WEKA","269861843_Research_on_the_Graduate_Career_Decision-making_Based_on_Rough_Set_Theory_and_Decision_Tree_Method","259084524_Gender_differences_in_applying_social_cognitive_career_theory_in_engineering_students","252039961_Research_about_the_college_students_career_counseling_expert_system_based_on_agent","224097941_Applying_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Placement_Chance_Prediction","222402930_Should_I_Stay_or_Should_I_Go_Career_Choice_Intentions_of_Students_with_Family_Business_Background","222065108_Predictive_and_construct_validity_of_six_experimental_measures_of_career_maturity","221273565_Applying_Link_Prediction_to_Ranking_Candidates_for_High-Level_Government_Post","221086846_Analysis_of_Individual_Career_Decision-Making_Based_on_Partial_Least-Squares_Regression_Model"]}
