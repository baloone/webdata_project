{"id":"313581856_Automatic_generation_of_English_language_test_questions_on_parts_of_speech","abstract":"This paper describes computer algebra aided generation of English language test questions for evaluating learners' knowledge of the different parts of speech. The aim of our work is automatic generation of test questions, which are automatically assessed as well. This is a further development of our recent work in the domain; in our previous work we have proposed methods for automatic generation of English language test questions connected with evaluating learners' knowledge of the lexical and grammatical structures that are met in the text; matching words and their meaning; matching parts of the whole; finding synonyms, antonyms and generalizations/specializations of words; test questions for adverbs and adjectives as well as word formation, particularly negative forms of adjectives. As a result, we obtain reduced time consumption during tests authoring, application of equal criteria, fair assessment and decreased influence of subjective factors.","authors":["Anna Malinova","Olga Rahneva","Angel Golev"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 111(3)","DOI:10.12732/ijpam.v111i3.14"],"references":["328268790_Distributed_Platform_for_e-Learning-DisPeL","314443819_NEW_ELECTRONIC_EDUCATION_SERVICES_USING_THE_DISTRIBUTED_E-LEARNING_PLATFORM_DisPeL","313877941_Automatic_generation_of_English_language_test_questions_using_Mathematica","303248329_COMPUTER_ALGEBRA_AIDED_GENERATION_OF_ENGLISH_LANGUAGE_TESTS","283865726_Automatic_Generation_of_English_Vocabulary_Tests","271199938_Automation_of_electronic_testing_examination_in_English_language_using_DeTC","256461759_The_Use_of_ICT_for_the_Assessment_of_Key_Competences","234773217_New_challenges_in_e-learning_of_mathematics_via_EVLM_and_IDeLC_projects","228924333_A_framework_for_automatic_generation_of_grammar_and_vocabulary_questions","228853575_Assisting_cloze_test_making_with_a_web_application"]}
