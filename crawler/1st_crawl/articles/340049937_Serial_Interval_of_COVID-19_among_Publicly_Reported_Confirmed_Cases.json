{"id":"340049937_Serial_Interval_of_COVID-19_among_Publicly_Reported_Confirmed_Cases","abstract":"We estimate the distribution of serial intervals for 468 confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus disease reported in China as of February 8, 2020. The mean interval was 3.96 days (95% CI 3.53–4.39 days), SD 4.75 days (95% CI 4.46–5.07 days); 12.6% of case reports indicated presymptomatic transmission.\n\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0357_article","authors":["Zhanwei Du","Xiao-Ke Xu","Ye Wu","Lin Wang"],"meta":["March 2020Emerging Infectious Diseases 26(6)","DOI:10.3201/eid2606.200357","Project: Computational Epidemiology"],"references":["338904336_Early_Transmission_Dynamics_in_Wuhan_China_of_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia","305343426_Outbreaks_of_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_in_Two_Hospitals_Initiated_by_a_Single_Patient_in_Daejeon_South_Korea","7157412_Transmission_Dynamics_and_Control_of_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome","6352980_How_generation_intervals_shape_the_relationship_between_growth_rates_and_reproductive_numbers","339239053_Epidemiological_research_priorities_for_public_health_control_of_the_ongoing_global_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_outbreak","338958716_Nowcasting_and_forecasting_the_potential_domestic_and_international_spread_of_the_2019-nCoV_outbreak_originating_in_Wuhan_China_a_modelling_study","7731693_The_estimation_of_SARS_incubation_distribution_from_serial_interval_data_using_a_convolution_likelihood","6626445_A_note_on_generation_times_in_epidemic_models","5457374_Generation_interval_contraction_and_epidemic_data_analysis"]}
