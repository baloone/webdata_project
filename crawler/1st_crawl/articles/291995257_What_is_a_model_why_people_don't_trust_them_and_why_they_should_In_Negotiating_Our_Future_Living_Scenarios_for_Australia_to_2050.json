Even when facing a very complex problem, we are rarely in a state of full ignorance: some expectation on system behaviour and on the level of risk arising from uncertainty is usually available and it is on this expectation that most decisions are taken. Humans use models, which are mental or formal representations of reality, to generate these expectations, employing an ability that is shared, more or less, by all forms of life. That is, whether it is a tree responding to shortening day length by dropping its leaves and preparing its metabolism for winter – in advance of winter – or a naked Pleistocene ape storing food in advance of winter for the same reasons, both are using models. This view leads to two outcomes. First, predictions, seen as an expectation of ranges of future behaviours, are not just desirable, but necessary for decision making; the often- asked question ‘do models provide reliable predictions?’ then shifts to ‘given a certain problem, what type of models provides the most useful and reliable prediction?’ Second, modelling is no longer a scientist’s activity, rather a social process and different types of models can be employed in order to ensure that all available information is included in model building and that model results are understood, trusted and acted upon.","authors":["Fabio Boschetti","Elizabeth A Fulton","Roger Hudson Bradbury","John Symons"],"meta":["January 2012","Project: Computer modelling and decision making"],"references":["325671831_The_psychological_bases_of_ideology_and_prejudice_Testing_a_dual_process_model","265288308_The_Role_of_Models_in_Prediction_for_Decision","265235988_Who_Is_Rational_Studies_of_Individual_Differences_in_Reasoning","298846417_Not_only_the_tragedy_of_the_commons_misperceptions_of_feedback_and_policies_for_sustainable_development","291993237_Policyftheory_data_models_tools_Rational_solutions_to_coral_reef_conservation","289852568_Computational_Irreducibility_and_the_Predictability_of_Complex_Physical_Systems","286270780_Judgment_Under_Uncertainty_Heuristics_and_Biases","285509913_Why_believe_a_computer_Models_measures_and_meaning_in_the_natural_world","263271569_Institutions_climate_change_and_cultural_theory_towards_a_common_analytical_framework","260135134_Anticipatory_Systems","259867085_Can_we_learn_how_complex_systems_work","248771145_Towards_a_Coherent_Philosophy_for_Modeling_the_Environment","248552627_Modelling_conditional_prediction","247504179_A_Dual-Process_Motivational_Model_of_Ideology_Politics_and_Prejudice","248497573_Predictions_and_policy_decisions"]}
