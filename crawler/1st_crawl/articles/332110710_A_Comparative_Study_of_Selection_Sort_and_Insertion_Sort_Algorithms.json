{"id":"332110710_A_Comparative_Study_of_Selection_Sort_and_Insertion_Sort_Algorithms","abstract":"The ordering of numbers in an integer array in computer science and mathematics is one of the research topics in the literature. For the purpose, there are a large variety of sorting algorithms like Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Radix sort, Merge sort and Bubble sort. In this study, two sorting algorithms of these algorithms are investigated as Selection and Insertion sort. This study compares performance of Selection sort and Insertion sort algorithms that are used commonly in terms of running time.","authors":["Fahriye Gemci"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":[]}
