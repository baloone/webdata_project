{"id":"345671726_The_structure_and_knowledge_flow_of_building_information_modeling_based_on_patent_citation_network_analysis","abstract":"Building information modeling (BIM) creates new business value and innovation in the construction engineering industry. This study identifies BIM technology structure and the characteristics of knowledge flow through a patent citation network. A technology patent database was collected with backward and forward citation patents currently registered in the US Patents and Trademark Office and identified by the Cooperative Patent Classification. Technology citation networks interact and follow the power law distribution. The analysis of individual patent characteristics and intermediaries revealed digital data processing and telemetry systems as core technology fields stimulating innovative BIM technology. This study overcomes the limitations of previous methods of technology forecasting that have depended on expert opinion or peer review by performing a patent big data analysis to ascertain the domain of the BIM industry. This approach could soon be applied to R&D strategy planning and competition in business and the development of cutting-edge technology.","authors":["Yoo-Na Park","Yoon-Sun Lee","Jaejun Kim","Tai Sik Lee"],"meta":["March 2018Automation in Construction 87:215-224","DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.023"],"references":["312367456_Big_Data_in_Civil_Engineering"]}
