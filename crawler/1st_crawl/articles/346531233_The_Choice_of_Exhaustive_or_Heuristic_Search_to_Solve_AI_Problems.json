{"id":"346531233_The_Choice_of_Exhaustive_or_Heuristic_Search_to_Solve_AI_Problems","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is an appealing area of research in computer science because it is concerned with the discovering of effective techniques that have been mainly motivated from human beings or their living environments to solve problems that have special nature. In this research, we aim first to introduce and analyze the common characteristics of problems that artificial intelligence interested in, and then we will highlight how to prepare such problems to solve them by search. The main goal of our study is helping us to decide which search strategy is better through investigating the behavior of most popular search strategies to find out the desired solution for two examples of a simple artificial intelligence problem. Our experiments presented that the required time and memory space to solve the problem mainly affected by many factors such as the applied search mechanism, the solution position, the number of available solutions, and the complexity in search.","authors":["Dalya Gatsh"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.54172/mjsc.v34i2.81"],"references":["326039952_Search_In_Artificial_Intelligence_Problem_Solving","335141602_Artificial_Intelligence_Foundations_of_Computational_Agents","333958571_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Soft_Computing_Behavioral_and_Cognitive_Modeling_of_the_Human_Brain","244454769_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Guide_to_Intelligent_Systems","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach"]}
