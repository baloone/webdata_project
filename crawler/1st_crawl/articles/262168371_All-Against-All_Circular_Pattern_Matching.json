{"id":"262168371_All-Against-All_Circular_Pattern_Matching","abstract":"Given a text T=T[1 … n] and a circular pattern P=P[1 … m], the circular pattern matching (CPM) problem is to find all occurrences of P in T. We present the first algorithm that exploits suffix links to solve the exact CPM (ECPM) problem in O(n log |Σ|) time and O(n) space, where Σ is the symbol alphabet. Then, we present a q-gram-based algorithm for the approximate CPM (ACPM) problem using the idea of bidirectional edit distance. Our algorithm\nfinds all k-approximate occurrences of P in T. We then extend each algorithm to solve the all-against-all variant of the CPM problem for both exact and k-approximate matches. Although the CPM problem has been studied since the 1980s, this is the first attempt on the all-against-all variant, without using a trivial application of standard CPM algorithms. Given a database S=S1$1S2$2 … SZ$Z of Z sequences, our algorithms solve the all-against-all ACPM problem in O(kmaN) time on average and O(kmmN2) worst case, where k is the error parameter, N=∑i=1Z(|Si|+1), ma=N/Z and mm=maxi=1,2,… Z{|Si|}. Space complexity is O(N). These can be compared with the O(N2malog ma) average and O(N3log mm) worst case time required by the best available ACPM algorithm.","authors":["Jie Lin","Donald Adjeroh"],"meta":["July 2012The Computer Journal 55(7):897-906","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxr126"],"references":["220403390_Distance_measures_based_on_the_edit_distance_for_permutation-type_representations","12709592_ProDom_and_ProDom-CG_tools_for_protein_domain_analysis_and_whole_genome_comparisons","12571894_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Detecting_Circular_Permutations_in_Proteins","7946674_Rapid_motif-based_prediction_of_circular_permutations_in_multi-domain_proteins","226522434_Two_algorithms_for_approxmate_string_matching_in_static_texts","224068487_Speeding_up_the_computation_of_the_edit_distance_for_cyclic_strings","223115327_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","222281145_Computing_suffix_links_for_suffix_trees_and_arrays","220407164_Fast_Canonization_of_Circular_Strings","220247783_Optimal_Canonization_of_All_Substrings_of_a_String","220112663_On_a_Cyclic_String-To-String_Correction_Problem","220110729_Lexicographically_Least_Circular_Substrings","3192110_Dynamic_Programming_Alignment_of_Sequences_Representing_Cyclic_Patterns"]}
