{"id":"269775327_A_Crash_Severity-Based_Black_Spot_Identification_Model","abstract":"The objective of this research is to develop a new black spot model incorporating the severity of crashes with high consistency. Crash history from 2005 to 2009 of the Ipswich Motorway, in Australia, was used to identify black spots by using simple ranking and empirical Bayes approach. The results of these analyses were then compared via two consistency tests. These tests revealed that for the simple ranking method and the empirical Bayes method, the crash type analysis was more consistent than the crash frequency analysis and the collective risk analysis. Further research into the validity of the proposed indicator would be recommended due to its incorporation of the crash severity and the high consistency it demonstrated in this study, both of which are of great benefit from a practical point of view.","authors":["Stephen Da Costa","Xiaobo Qu","Partha Mani Parajuli"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Transportation Safety & Security 7(3)","DOI:10.1080/19439962.2014.911230"],"references":["291116380_Effect_of_street_pattern_on_single_vehicle_crash_severity","270213808_Effect_of_Street_Pattern_on_Road_Safety","263926702_Freeway_Accident_Likelihood_Prediction_Using_a_Panel_Data_Analysis_Approach","258953877_Safety_Evaluation_for_Expressways_A_Comparative_Study_for_Macroscopic_and_Microscopic_Indicators","233972833_Analysis_of_the_Frequency_and_Severity_of_Rear-End_Crashes_in_Work_Zones","230229521_Logistic_model_of_injury_risks_in_single_vehicle_crashes_in_urban_neighborhoods","275384449_Uncertainty_Propagation_in_Quantitative_Risk_Assessment_Modeling_for_Fire_in_Road_Tunnels","272718436_Analyses_and_Implications_of_Accidents_in_Singapore_Strait","265968793_Bus_stop-skipping_scheme_with_random_travel_time","260559079_A_note_on_hotspot_identification_for_urban_expressways","260217244_Applying_quantile_regression_for_modeling_equivalent_property_damage_only_crashes_to_identify_accident_blackspots","257551200_Optimal_distance_tolls_under_congestion_pricing_and_continuously_distributed_value_of_time","257550986_The_economic_importance_of_the_Straits_of_Malacca_and_Singapore_An_extreme-scenario_analysis","245562564_Comparative_Analysis_of_Techniques_for_Identifying_Locations_of_Hazardous_Roads","238048251_Property_Damage_Crash_Equivalency_Factors_to_Solve_Crash_Frequency-Severity_Dilemma_Case_Study_on_South_Korean_Rural_Roads","237534108_New_Criteria_for_Evaluating_Methods_of_Identifying_Hot_Spots","237189288_Gaussian_background_mixture_model_based_automatic_incident_detection_system_for_real-time_tracking","225185722_Estimation_of_rear-end_vehicle_crash_frequencies_in_urban_road_tunnels","220214633_Design_and_implementation_of_a_quantitative_risk_assessment_software_tool_for_Singapore_road_tunnels","45799106_A_probabilistic_quantitative_risk_assessment_model_for_the_long-term_work_zone_crashes","41450878_A_comparative_analysis_of_hotspot_identification_methods","9007978_Prioritising_road_safety_initiatives_fatality_versus_social_cost","7780820_Experimental_evaluation_of_hotspot_identification_methods"]}
