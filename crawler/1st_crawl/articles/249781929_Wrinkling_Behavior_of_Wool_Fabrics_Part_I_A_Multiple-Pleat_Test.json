{"id":"249781929_Wrinkling_Behavior_of_Wool_Fabrics_Part_I_A_Multiple-Pleat_Test","abstract":"A multiple-pleat test has been developed for measuring the change in wrinkling properties of light to medium-weight wool fabrics following various finishing and chemical treatments. Accordion pleats are inserted in a fabric sample (6 in. X 3 in.) by two meshing sets of 30째 wedges under uniform load. After holding under the required conditions, the sample is removed and the average pleat angle is measured optically at three intervals over a period of one day.\nThe complete wrinkling behavior is given by two terms, the percentage wrinkle recovery WR at a specified time (usually 15 min) and the recovery rate RR (WR change per unit log time).\nA sequence of short conditioning and pleating times at 85% RH and 30째C, with recovery at 65% RH and 21째C, is used to develop a large wrinkling effect. The method requires fewer samples than conventional 180째-fold methods and is more versatile under the specified testing conditions. Results show that the change in wrinkling properties during storage or after steam-pressing must not be overlooked in interpreting the results.","authors":["H. J.
