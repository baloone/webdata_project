{"id":"233933844_Searching_Data_Using_Centralized_Diamond_Architecture","abstract":"Azurin is copper-containing protein called cupredoxin protein. This protein mainly involve in electron-transfer. In the present study, azurin proteins from different Pseudomonas species were analysed for their primary, secondary structure, physiochemical analysis and phylogenetic relation. The present study indicated that amino acid composition, molecular weight varies among the azurin protein. Alanine is the most common and abundant amino acid. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the azurin protein of various species of Pseudomonas had a common ancestor, closely related and the sequences are highly conserved.","authors":["Masumeh Damrudi","K J Aval"],"meta":["January 2011Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 8:807-811"],"references":["234148608_Parallel_Algorithmic_Techniques_For_Combinational_Computation","233933838_A_new_parallel_sorting_on_Diamond_architecture","226774422_Skin_Lesions_Diagnosis_Based_on_Fluorescence_Image_Processing_Simple_Parameters_Scanning","224483213_Some_computer_organizations_and_their_effectiveness_IEEE_Trans_Comput_C-21948","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","221472180_Skin_Lesion_Diagnosis_Using_Fluorescence_Images","220897758_Parallel_Algorithmic_Techniques_for_Combinatorial_Computation","220695437_Algorithms_for_Image_Processing_and_Computer_Vision","220413715_Cursor_Movement_Control_Development_by_Using_ANFIS_Algorithm","19993060_Pearson_WR_Lipman_DJ_Improved_tools_for_biological_sequence_comparison_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_85_2444-2448","13913948_In_vivo_studies_disprove_an_obligatory_role_of_azurin_in_denitrification_in_Pseudomonas_Aeruginosa_and_show_that_azurin_expression_is_under_control_of_RpoS_and_ANR","13434542_Iterated_profile_searches_with_PSI-BLAST-A_tool_for_discovery_in_protein_databases","2989747_Very_High-Speed_Computing_Systems","2948417_Margin_Based_Feature_Selection_-_Theory_and_Algorithms","313560953_Some_computer_organizations_and_their_effectiveness","284650481_Improved_Tools_for_Biological_Sequence_Comparison","261423549_The_optimal_running_time_from_computational_models_by_comparing_two_parallel_searching_procedures","240364160_Two_Dimensional_Image_and_Signal_Processing_Prentice-Hall","235890195_Digital_Image_Processing","233933840_ENOD_sort_on_Diamond_architecture","224099805_Diamond_architecture_with_NOD_sorting","220689600_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Parallel_Algorithm","220329152_A_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithm_for_Feature_Subset_Selection","200132376_Two-dimensional_signal_and_image_processing","15143195_Rack-induced_bonding_in_blue-copper_proteins","3823141_Neuro-fuzzy_control_of_a_steam_boiler-turbine_unit","3687514_On_developing_an_adaptive_neural-fuzzy_control_system","3511383_Efficient_parallel_algorithms_for_selection_and_searching_on_sorted_matrices","3351972_Fuzzy_neural_networks_and_application_to_the_FBC_process"]}
