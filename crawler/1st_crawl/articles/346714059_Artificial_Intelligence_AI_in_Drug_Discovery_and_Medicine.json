{"id":"346714059_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_in_Drug_Discovery_and_Medicine","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of algorithms that seek to simulate human intelligence. The phrase “artificial intelligence” was likely coined during a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. The earliest work of medical AI dates back to the early 1970s. Over years, AI has found implications in various fields. In this article, we summarize its applications in drug discovery and medicine.","authors":["Varun Ahuja"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.46619/joccr.2019.2-1043","Project: Drug Safety Assessment"],"references":["326408967_Machine_Learning_of_Toxicological_Big_Data_Enables_Read-Across_Structure_Activity_Relationships_RASAR_Outperforming_Animal_Test_Reproducibility","322722712_The_rise_of_deep_learning_in_drug_discovery","322695006_Scalable_and_accurate_deep_learning_for_electronic_health_records","322651286_Brain_tumor_segmentation_in_multi-spectral_MRI_using_convolutional_neural_networks_CNN","322367205_De_Novo_Design_of_Bioactive_Small_Molecules_by_Artificial_Intelligence","321235948_A_machine_learning_approach_to_triaging_patients_with_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","323373904_Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses_and_Treatable_Diseases_by_Image-Based_Deep_Learning","322319200_Methodologic_Guide_for_Evaluating_Clinical_Performance_and_Effect_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Technology_for_Medical_Diagnosis_and_Prediction","322133343_An_Interpretable_Machine_Learning_Model_for_Accurate_Prediction_of_Sepsis_in_the_ICU","321832537_Automating_drug_discovery","315369547_Use_of_a_Novel_Artificial_Intelligence_Platform_on_Mobile_Devices_to_Assess_Dosing_Compliance_in_a_Phase_2_Clinical_Trial_in_Subjects_With_Schizophrenia","320821952_Performance_of_a_Deep-Learning_Neural_Network_Model_in_Assessing_Skeletal_Maturity_on_Pediatric_Hand_Radiographs","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318259423_Cardiologist-Level_Arrhythmia_Detection_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","316443493_Deep_Learning_at_Chest_Radiography_Automated_Classification_of_Pulmonary_Tuberculosis_by_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
