{"id":"331198438_Wavelet_OFDM_with_Overlap_FDE_for_non-Gaussian_channels_in_precoded_NOMA_based_systems","abstract":"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered as a prominent multiple access technique for fifth generation (5G) systems mainly because of its high spectral efficiency (SE). NOMA based system employs superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the transmitter and receiver side respectively. Classical multi-carrier NOMA adopts orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as a multi-carrier modulation (MCM) technique; however, high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and cyclic prefix (CP) inclusion makes OFDM an inadequate choice for NOMA. To improve SE of the OFDM-NOMA, wavelet transform (WT) has been proposed for NOMA. This article proposes new physical layer techniques based on OFDM-NOMA and Wavelet OFDM (WOFDM) -NOMA for tactile internet and investigates their performance in the presence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian channels. Overlap frequency domain equalization (OFDE) is proposed as a robust equalization technique to improve the performance of SIC in the presence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian channels for OFDM-NOMA and WOFDM-NOMA. Moreover, to enhance the equalization efficiency of the OFDE, linear precoding (LP) in the form of Walsh Hadamard transform (WHT) is also recommended for OFDM and WOFDM based NOMA transceivers which improves the reliability of the network. Performance of the proposed precoded OFDM-NOMA and precoded WOFDM-NOMA with OFDE is analyzed in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulse noise for Rayleigh fading channel. Link level performance of the presented structures for downlink NOMA is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER), PAPR, SE and computational complexity (CC). Furthermore, performance of the proposed architectures is also compared in the presence of impulse noise having different intensities. Simulation results via computer show that the proposed precoded WOFDM-NOMA with OFDE transceiver incorporates low latency through waveform shaping and enhanced reliability through precoding and efficient equalization. Thus, proposed advanced physical layer not only performs better than its counterparts but presence of OFDE enhances SIC performance even in the presence of impulse noise at the expense of slight elevation in CC.","authors":["Arsla Khan","Saud Khan","Sobia Baig","Hafiz Asif"],"meta":["February 2019Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2019.02.025"],"references":["321121432_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_in_a_mmWave_Based_IoT_Wireless_System_with_SWIPT","319869593_A_Precoding_Based_Multicarrier_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_Scheme_for_5G_Cellular_Networks_Baig","313464630_Faster-Than-Nyquist_Signaling_An_Overview","301798200_BER_assessment_of_FFT-OFDM_against_WHT-OFDM_over_different_fading_channel","296484314_MIMO-NOMA_Design_for_Small_Packet_Transmission_in_the_Internet_of_Things","294108489_5G-Enabled_Tactile_Internet","289895647_A_new_Discrete_Hartley_transform_precoding_based_interleaved-OFDMA_uplink_system_with_reduced_PAPR_for_4G_cellular_networks","281486941_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_With_Underlaid_Device-to-Device_Communications_Performance_and_Tradeoffs","276306605_Low_Complexity_Discrete_Hartley_Transform_Precoded_OFDM_System_over_Frequency-Selective_Fading_Channel","276121985_DWMT_transceiver_equalization_using_overlap_FDE_for_downlink_ADSL","261090393_Experimental_Verification_of_Frequency_Mappings_with_Hadamard_Transform_for_Power_Line_Communications_Channel","233885988_The_PAPR_problem_in_OFDM_transmission_New_directions_for_a_long-lasting_problem","231175237_Precoding_techniques_in_OFDM_systems_for_PAPR_reduction","226342122_Improved_Robust_Techniques_for_Multiuser_Detection_in_Non-Gaussian_Channels","4330667_Advanced_signal_processing_for_PLCs_Wavelet-OFDM","3317116_Robust_multiuser_detection_in_non-Gaussian_channels","3160809_Multiuser_detection_in_flat_fading_non-Gaussian_channels","327263958_Comparison_of_Limited_Feedback_Schemes_for_NOMA_Transmission_in_mmWave_Drone_Networks","318107713_Linear_precoded_wavelet_OFDM-based_PLC_system_with_overlap_FDE_for_impulse_noise_mitigation","317655650_A_Survey_on_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_for_5G_Networks_Research_Challenges_and_Future_Trends","317394578_Walsh_Hadamard_transform_based_transceiver_design_for_SC-FDMA_with_discrete_wavelet_transform","315906326_Linear_Precoding_Techniques_for_OFDM-Based_NOMA_over_Frequency-Selective_Fading_Channels","314648827_Low_Complexity_User_Pairing_and_Power_Allocation_Algorithm_for_5G_Cellular_Network_Non-orthogonal_Multiple_Access","312477718_Performance_of_Non-orthogonal_Multiple_Access_NOMA_with_a_Novel_Asynchronous_Interference_Cancellation_Technique","309441628_Wavelet_OFDM-Based_Non-orthogonal_Multiple_Access_Downlink_Transceiver_for_Future_Radio_Access","308847145_Receiver_Design_for_Downlink_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_NOMA","306075842_A_General_Power_Allocation_Scheme_to_Guarantee_Quality_of_Service_in_Downlink_and_Uplink_NOMA_Systems","301836578_Power_and_Channel_Allocation_for_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_in_5G_Systems_Tractability_and_Computation","290508902_Layered-Division-Multiplexing_Theory_and_Practice","263319981_Designing_non-contiguous_orthogonal_frequency_division_multiplexing_transceiver_based_on_wavelet_transform_and_removable_cyclic_prefix_for_spectrum_sharing_in_cognitive_radio_systems","261377915_Non-Orthogonal_Multiple_Access_NOMA_for_Cellular_Future_Radio_Access","260664762_Effect_of_PAPR_Reduction_on_Spectrum_and_Energy_Efficiencies_in_OFDM_Systems_With_Class-A_HPA_Over_AWGN_Channel","257803267_Zadoff-Chu_Matrix_Transform_Precoding-Based_Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiple_Access_Uplink_Systems_A_Peak-to-Average_Power_Ratio_Performance","257758727_PAPR_reduction_in_mobile_WiMAX_A_new_ZCMT_precoded_random_interleaved_OFDMA_system","254908767_Ripples_in_Communication_Reconfigurable_and_Adaptive_Wireless_Communication_Systems_based_on_Wavelet_Packet_Modulators","224603722_Errors_per_scale_statistics_for_a_wavelet_OFDM_transmission_in_flat_fading_channels","220241432_Iterative_overlap_FDE_for_multicode_DS-CDMA","4253186_A_Frequency_Domain_Equalizer_in_Discrete_Wavelet_Packet_Multitone_Transceiver_for_In-Home_PLC_Lans","4062474_Low_complexity_CDMA_downlink_receiver_based_on_frequency_domain_equalization","3853400_PAPR_reduction_in_OFDM_transmission_using_Hadamard_transform"]}
