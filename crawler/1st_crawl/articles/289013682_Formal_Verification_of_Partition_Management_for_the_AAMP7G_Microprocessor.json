{"id":"289013682_Formal_Verification_of_Partition_Management_for_the_AAMP7G_Microprocessor","abstract":"The AAMP7G microprocessor, currently in use in Rockwell Collins high-assurance system products, uniquely supports strict time and space partitioning in hardware. In this chapter, we describe the formal modeling and proof effort that led to an NSA multiple independent levels of security (MILS) certification for the AAMP7G. The MILS certificate allows a single AAMP7G CPU to concurrently process Unclassified through Top Secret codeword information. We discuss the formal model architecture of the AAMP7G at several levels, including the microcode and instruction set levels. We describe how the ACL2 theorem prover was used to develop a formal security specification, called GWV, and outline a mathematical proof (machine-checked using ACL2) which established that the AAMP7G trusted microcode implements that security specification, in accordance with EAL 7 requirements. We also discuss the evaluation process, which validated that the formalizations accurately model what was actually designed and built. Finally, we provide an overview of a technique for compositional reasoning at the instruction set level, using a symbolic simulation-based technique.","authors":["Matthew M.
