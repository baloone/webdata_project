{"id":"225408169_Prime_number_generation_using_memetic_programming","abstract":"For centuries, the study of prime numbers has been regarded as a subject of pure mathematics in number theory. Recently, this\nvision has changed and the importance of prime numbers has increased rapidly, especially in information technology, e.g.,\npublic key cryptography algorithms, hash tables, and pseudo-random number generators. One of the most popular topics to attract\nattention is to find a formula that maps the set of natural numbers into the set of prime numbers. However, to date there\nis no known formula that produces all primes. In this article, we use a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, called the memetic\nprogramming (MP) algorithm, to generate mathematical formulas that produce distinct primes. Using the MP algorithm, we succeeded\nin discovering an interesting set of formulas that produce sets of distinct primes.\n\nKey wordsHybrid evolutionary algorithm–Iterated local search–Memetic programming–Prime number","authors":["Emad Mabrouk","Julio Hernandez-Castro","Masao Fukushima"],"meta":["June 2011Artificial Life and Robotics 16(1):53-56","DOI:10.1007/s10015-011-0890-3"],"references":["228791048_Memetic_Programming_Algorithm_with_Automatically_Defined_Functions","221410845_Memetic_programming_with_adaptive_local_search_using_tree_data_structures","221009327_Predicting_Prime_Numbers_Using_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming","239066731_Genetic_Programming_On_the_Programming_of_Computers_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection"]}
