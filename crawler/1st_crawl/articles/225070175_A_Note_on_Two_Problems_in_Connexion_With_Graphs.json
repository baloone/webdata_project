{"id":"225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","abstract":"We consider a graph with n vertices, all pairs of which are connected by an edge; each edge is of given positive length. The following two basic problems are solved. Problem 1: construct the tree of minimal total length between the n vertices. (A tree is a graph with one and only one path between any two vertices.) Problem 2: find the path of minimal total length between two given vertices.","authors":["Edsger Wybe.
