{"id":"320079018_Everyday_Functioning_Benefits_from_an_Assisted_Living_Platform_amongst_Frail_Older_Adults_and_Their_Caregivers","abstract":"Ambient assisted living technologies (AAL) are regarded as a promising solution to support aging in place. Yet, their efficacy has to be demonstrated in terms of benefits for independent living and for work conditions of caregivers. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the benefits of a multi-task AAL platform for both Frail older Individuals (FIs) and professional caregivers with respect to everyday functioning and caregiver burden. In this context, a 6-month field study involved 32 FIs living at home (half of them were equipped by the platform and the remaining half were not, as a control condition) and their caregivers. Everyday functioning measures were reported by frail participants and caregivers. Self-reported burden measures of caregiver were also collected. The main results showed that the caregiver's estimates of everyday functioning of equipped participants were unchanged across time, while they decreased for the control participants. Also, a reduction of self-reported objective burden was obtained after 6 months of AAL intervention for the equipped group, compared to the control group. Overall, these results highlighted the potential of AAL as a relevant environmental support for preventing both functional losses in FIs and objective burden professional caregiver.","authors":["Lucile Dupuy","Charlotte Froger","Charles Consel","Hélène Sauzéon"],"meta":["September 2017Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 9:302","DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2017.00302","Project: HomeAssist project"],"references":["326053839_Designing_an_accessible_and_engaging_email_application_for_aging_in_place","312253012_From_Activity_Recognition_to_Intention_Recognition_for_Assisted_Living_Within_Smart_Homes","313616326_Assessing_self-maintenance_activities_of_daily_living_mobility_and_instrumental_activities_of_daily_living","313209725_Caregiving_and_the_stress_process_an_overview_of_concepts_and_their_measures","313084646_The_timed_Up_and_Go_A_basic_test_of_functional_mobility","312609767_Mini-mental_state-practical_method_for_grading_cognitive_state_of_patients_for_clinicians","309563553_Usability_accessibility_and_ambient-assisted_living_A_systematic_literature_review","308183621_Self_determination-based_design_to_achieve_acceptance_of_assisted_living_technologies_for_older_adults","305998497_A_Unifying_Notification_System_To_Scale_Up_Assistive_Services","301542008_Smart_homes_and_home_health_monitoring_technologies_for_older_adults_A_systematic_review"]}
