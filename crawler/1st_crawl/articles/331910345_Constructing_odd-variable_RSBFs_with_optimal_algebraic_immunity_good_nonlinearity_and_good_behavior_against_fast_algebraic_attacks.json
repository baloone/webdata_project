This paper presents a new construction of odd-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. The nonlinearity of the new functions is higher than some existing theoretical constructions of rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. Further, it is also checked that such functions have almost optimal immunity against fast algebraic attacks for small variables. Besides, the algebraic degree of the constructed functions is also high enough.","authors":["Yindong Chen","Fei Guo","Jie Ruan"],"meta":["March 2019Discrete Applied Mathematics 262(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2019.02.041"],"references":["235640002_Highly_Nonlinear_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_Good_Behavior_Against_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","224242489_Balanced_rotation_symmetric_boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","221348381_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Decomposition_of_Boolean_Functions","221348082_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers_with_Linear_Feedback","221347953_Efficient_Computation_of_Algebraic_Immunity_for_Algebraic_and_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks","221327270_An_Infinite_Class_of_Balanced_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_Good_Immunity_to_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_and_Good_Nonlinearity","220942650_Results_on_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_and_Correlation_Immune_Boolean_Functions","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","3085927_Algebraic_immunity_for_cryptographically_significant_Boolean_functions_Analysis_and_construction","345035877_Constructing_Odd-Variable_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity_and_High_Nonlinearity","303878694_Construction_of_odd-Variable_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","284357688_New_Construction_of_Even-variable_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Optimum_Algebraic_Immunity","272030177_Two_constructions_of_balanced_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_high_nonlinearity_and_good_behavior_against_fast_algebraic_attacks","257554710_Construction_of_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_optimal_algebraic_immunity_and_high_nonlinearity","242518319_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_optimal","223319299_Rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions-Count_and_cryptographic_properties","221540671_Results_on_Algebraic_Immunity_for_Cryptographically_Significant_Boolean_Functions","221354680_Rewriting_Variables_The_Complexity_of_Fast_Algebraic_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","221282484_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","220681072_Two_Classes_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimum_Algebraic_Immunity_Construction_and_Analysis","220639279_A_conjecture_on_binary_string_and_its_applicationson_constructing_Boolean_functions_of_optimal_algebraic_immunity","220334165_Construction_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity_on_Odd_Number_of_Variables","220097102_New_constructions_of_even-variable_rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity"]}
