{"id":"276152381_Current_status_and_advancement_of_cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","abstract":"This paper presents the current status and the latest advancement of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in manufacturing. In order to understand CPS and its future potential in manufacturing, definitions and characteristics of CPS are explained and compared with cloud manufacturing concept. Research and applications are outlined to highlight the latest advancement in the field. CPS shows great promise in factories of the future in the areas of future trends as identified at the end of this paper.","authors":["Lihui Wang","Martin TÃ¶rngren","Mauro Onori"],"meta":["May 2015Journal of Manufacturing Systems 37(2):517-527","DOI:10.1016/j.jmsy.2015.04.008"],"references":["318775505_Cyber_Manufacturing_Research_and_Applications","266461166_Evolvable_production_systems_Mechatronic_production_equipment_with_process-based_distributed_control","321621304_Changeable_and_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_Systems","319549601_Architecting_principles_for_systems-of-systems","305750766_Using_timing-based_side_channels_for_anomaly_detection_in_industrial_control_systems","285855850_A_model_for_types_and_levels_of_human_interaction_with_automation","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","269820960_An_overview_of_function_block_enabled_adaptive_process_planning_for_machining","269100126_Evolvable_Production_Systems_Environment_for_New_Business_Models","264292731_Architecting_Principles_for_System_of_Systems"]}
