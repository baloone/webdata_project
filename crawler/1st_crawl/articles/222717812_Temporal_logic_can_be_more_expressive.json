{"id":"222717812_Temporal_logic_can_be_more_expressive","abstract":"It is first proved that there are properties of sequences that are not expressible in temporal logic, even though they are easily expressible using, for instance, regular expressions. Then, it is shown how temporal logic can be extended to express any property definable by a right-linear grammar and hence a regular expression. Finally, a complete axiomatization and a decision procedure for the extended temporal logic are given and the complexity of the extended logic is examined.","authors":["Pierre Wolper"],"meta":["February 1983Information and Control 56(1-2):72-99","DOI:10.1016/S0019-9958(83)80051-5"],"references":["317560162_On_the_temporal_analysis_of_fairness","285374185_Verification_of_concurrent_programs_the_temporal_framework_in_The_Correctness_Problem_in_Computer_Science","269002639_Verification_of_Sequential_Programs_Temporal_Axiomatization","256554868_An_elementary_proof_of_the_completeness_of_PDL","249639046_Specification_and_synthesis_of_communicating_processes_using_an_extended_temporal_logic","248072786_Theory_of_-languages_I_characterizations_of_-context-free_languages","242477758_Verification_of_concurrent_programs_the_temporal_framework","242367571_Weak_monadic_second_order_theory_of_succesor_is_not_elementary-recursive","239563075_Software_Specification_Languages_Based_on_Regular_Expressions","226906547_The_temporal_logic_of_branching_time","222973089_Theory_of_o-languagesI_Characterizations_of_o-context-free_languages","222466168_The_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Deterministic_Well-Structured_Programs","222461895_Process_Logic_Expressiveness_Decidability_Completeness","222216339_Relationships_between_nondeterministic_and_deterministic_tape_complexities","221591865_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Looping_and_Converse","220997033_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Branching_Time","220897186_Characterizing_Correctness_Properties_of_Parallel_Programs_Using_Fixpoints","220827120_Synthesis_of_Communicating_Processes_from_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","220688095_First-Order_Dynamic_Logic","220575001_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Regular_Programs","36247933_Synthesis_of_communicating_processes_from_temporal_logic_specifications_microform","35991539_Tense_logic_and_the_theory_of_linear_order","4355244_The_prepositional_dynamic_logic_of_deterministic_well-structured_programs","4355234_Propositional_dynamic_logic_of_context-free_programs","4354738_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Programs"]}
