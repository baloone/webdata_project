{"id":"301832002_A_discussion_of_fault-tolerant_supervisory_control_in_terms_of_formal_languages","abstract":"A system is fault tolerant if it remains functional after the occurrence of a fault. Given a plant subject to a fault, fault-tolerant control requires the controller to form a fault-tolerant closed-loop system. For the systematic design of a fault-tolerant controller, typical input data consists of the plant dynamics including the effect of the faults under consideration and a formal performance requirement with a possible allowance for degraded performance after the fault. For its obvious practical relevance, the synthesis of fault-tolerant controllers has received extensive attention in the literature, however, with a particular focus on continuous-variable systems. The present paper addresses discrete-event systems and provides an overview on fault-tolerant supervisory control. The discussion is held in terms of formal languages to uniformly present approaches to passive fault-tolerance, active fault-tolerance, post-fault recovery and fault hiding.","authors":["Thomas Moor"],"meta":["May 2016Annual Reviews in Control 41","DOI:10.1016/j.arcontrol.2016.04.001"],"references":["267958925_On_the_Computation_of_Supremal_Sublanguages_Relevant_to_Supervisory_Control","261672601_Computation_of_Supervisors_for_Fault-Recovery_and_Repair_for_Discrete_Event_Systems","296076582_Zur_Methodik_und_Anwendung_fehlerverdeckender_Steuerungsrekonfiguration_fur_eine_Klasse_ereignisdiskreter_Systeme","283897483_Fault-Tolerant_Supervisory_Control","279749705_Fault-Tolerant_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_with_Lower-Bound_Specifications","278695662_Fault-Tolerant_Design","269264894_A_Fault_Modeling_Approach_for_InputOutput_Automata","266858903_Control_Reconfiguration_of_Dynamical_Systems","264006690_Framework_for_Optimal_Fault-Tolerant_Control_Synthesis_Maximize_Prefault_While_Minimize_Post-Fault_Behaviors","262725827_A_Framework_for_State_Attraction_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_under_Partial_Observation"]}
