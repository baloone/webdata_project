{"id":"324592886_Transition_from_Passive_Learner_to_Critical_Evaluator_through_Peer-Testing_of_Programming_Artefacts","abstract":"Offering timely feedback on programming while encouraging learners to engage in critical evaluation of programs are the objectives of peer-testing. We report on a peer-testing experiment with students on distant campuses using a Web platform. The experiment shows the potential that peer-testing has to help students transition from passive learners to critical evaluators.
