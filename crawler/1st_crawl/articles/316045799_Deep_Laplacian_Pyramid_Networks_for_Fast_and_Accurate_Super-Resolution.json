{"id":"316045799_Deep_Laplacian_Pyramid_Networks_for_Fast_and_Accurate_Super-Resolution","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality reconstruction for single-image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose the Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network (LapSRN) to progressively reconstruct the sub-band residuals of high-resolution images. At each pyramid level, our model takes coarse-resolution feature maps as input, predicts the high-frequency residu-als, and uses transposed convolutions for upsampling to the finer level. Our method does not require the bicubic interpolation as the pre-processing step and thus dramatically reduces the computational complexity. We train the proposed LapSRN with deep supervision using a robust Charbonnier loss function and achieve high-quality reconstruction. Furthermore , our network generates multi-scale predictions in one feed-forward pass through the progressive reconstruction , thereby facilitates resource-aware applications. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy.","authors":["Wei-Sheng Lai","Jia-Bin Huang","Narendra Ahuja","Ming-Hsuan Yang"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2017.618","Conference: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"references":["308152499_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_a_Generative_Adversarial_Network","312830456_Super-Resolution_Using_Sub-Band_Self-Similarity","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","311611431_Deeply-Recursive_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","308852884_Fast_and_accurate_image_upscaling_with_super-resolution_forests","308278288_Accelerating_the_Super-Resolution_Convolutional_Neural_Network","308278045_Learning_to_Refine_Object_Segments","308277743_Laplacian_Pyramid_Reconstruction_and_Refinement_for_Semantic_Segmentation","307925703_Real-Time_Single_Image_and_Video_Super-Resolution_Using_an_Efficient_Sub-Pixel_Convolutional_Neural_Network","307895539_Super-resolution_through_neighbor_embedding","305779418_Accelerating_the_Super-Resolution_Convolutional_Neural_Network","301836893_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution","300412657_Deep_Networks_for_Image_Super-Resolution_with_Sparse_Prior","300412517_Video_Super-Resolution_via_Deep_Draft-Ensemble_Learning","288640908_A_Adjusted_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Super-Resolution"]}
