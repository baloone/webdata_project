{"id":"272199155_Equivalence_classes_of_Dyck_paths_modulo_some_statistics","abstract":"We investigate new equivalence relations on the set of Dyck paths relatively to the three statistics of double rises, peaks and valleys. Two Dyck paths are -equivalent (respectively -equivalent and -equivalent) whenever the positions of their double rises (respectively peaks and valleys) are the same. Then, we provide generating functions for the numbers of -, - and -equivalence classes of .","authors":["Jean-Luc Baril","Armen Petrossiana"],"meta":["April 2015Discrete Mathematics 338(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2014.12.003"],"references":["280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","230799571_Counting_Dyck_Paths_According_to_the_Maximum_Distance_Between_Peaks_and_Valleys","220915842_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","267130795_Some_strings_in_Dyck_paths","265823769_The_Statistic_number_of_udu's_in_Dyck_Paths","244437174_ON_THE_PRIME_DECOMPOSITION_OF_DYCK_WORDS","230802625_Statistics_on_Dyck_paths","230801578_Counting_peaks_at_height_k_in_a_Dyck_path","223085901_Some_statistics_on_Dyck_paths","222392289_Dyck_path_enumeration"]}
