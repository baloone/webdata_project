{"id":"232474646_Drug_Use_Violence_and_Victimization_among_White_American_Mexican_American_and_American_Indian_Dropouts_Students_with_Academic_Problems_and_Students_in_Good_Academic_Standing","abstract":"Problem-prone behaviors of White American, Mexican American, and American Indian high school dropouts, students in good academic standing, and students in poor academic standing were surveyed. Generally, dropouts were most involved with drugs, perpetration of violence, and victimization by violence, students in poor standing were the next most involved, and students in good standing were least involved. Ethnicity did not interact with academic status, suggesting that differences between dropouts and students were similar across ethnic groups. Some ethnicity and gender main effects were found. Findings were related to R. Jessor's (see record \n1992-23064-001) theory of problem-prone behaviors, to peer cluster theory, and to intervention design.
