{"id":"295856189_EcceTERA_Comprehensive_gene_tree-species_tree_reconciliation_using_parsimony","abstract":"A gene tree-species tree reconciliation explains the evolution of a gene tree within the species tree given a model of gene-family\nevolution. We describe ecceTERA, a program that implements a generic parsimony reconciliation algorithm, which accounts for\ngene duplication, loss and transfer (DTL) as well as speciation, involving sampled and unsampled lineages, within undated,\nfully dated or partially dated species trees. The ecceTERA reconciliation model and algorithm generalize or improve upon most\npublished DTL parsimony algorithms for binary species trees and binary gene trees. Moreover, ecceTERA can estimate accurate\nspecies-tree aware gene trees using amalgamation.\n\nAvailability and implementation: ecceTERA is freely available under http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/download_sources/16__ecceTERA and can be run online at http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/subsection/softExec.php?soft=eccetera.\n\nContact: celine.scornavacca{at}umontpellier.fr\nSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Edwin Jacox","Cedric Chauve","Gergely J Szollosi","Yann Ponty"],"meta":["February 2016Bioinformatics 32(13)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw105"],"references":["283793198_A_fast_method_for_calculating_reliable_event_supports_in_tree_reconciliations_via_Pareto_optimality","283446016_SylvX_A_viewer_for_phylogenetic_tree_reconciliations","272081409_EUCALYPT_efficient_tree_reconciliation_enumerator","269223962_Improved_Gene_Tree_Error-Correction_in_the_Presence_of_Horizontal_Gene_Transfer","268985519_Joint_Amalgamation_of_Most_Parsimonious_Reconciled_Gene_Trees","262159398_Accounting_for_Gene_Tree_Uncertainties_Improves_Gene_Trees_and_Reconciliation_Inference","262072398_Reconciliation_of_Gene_and_Species_Trees","258247450_The_Inference_of_Gene_Trees_with_Species_Trees","257757099_Support_Measures_to_Estimate_the_Reliability_of_Evolutionary_Events_Predicted_by_Reconciliation_Methods","255706829_Efficient_Exploration_of_the_Space_of_Reconciled_Gene_Trees","236933392_Bio_Efficient_Extensible_Libraries_and_Tools_for_Computational_Molecular_Evolution","236249563_Representing_a_set_of_reconciliations_in_a_compact_way","235377213_Lateral_Gene_Transfer_from_the_Dead","230827164_Inferring_duplications_losses_transfers_and_incomplete_lineage_sorting_with_nonbinary_species_trees","225736315_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_GeneSpecies_Trees_Parsimonious_Reconciliation_with_Losses_Duplications_and_Transfers","225293579_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Reconciliation_Problem_with_Gene_Duplication_Horizontal_Transfer_and_Loss","221686015_Modeling_Gene_Family_Evolution_and_Reconciling_Phylogenetic_Discord","221530268_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_GeneSpecies_Trees_Parsimonious_Reconciliation_with_Losses_Duplications_and_Transfers","51665291_Models_algorithms_and_programs_for_phylogeny_reconciliation","49754049_Simultaneous_Identification_of_Duplications_and_Lateral_Gene_Transfers","49694635_Rapid_evolutionary_innovation_during_an_Archaean_Genetic_Expansion","45693962_The_Cophylogeny_Reconstruction_Problem_Is_NP-Complete","45237377_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_GeneSpecies_Trees_Parsimonious_Reconciliation_with_Losses_Duplications_and_Transfers","41561383_Jane_A_new_tool_for_the_cophylogeny_reconstruction_problem","7183102_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","292800734_Duplication_Rearrangement_and_Reconciliation_A_Follow-Up_13_Years_Later","290013218_A_hybrid_micro-macroevolutionary_approach_to_gene_tree_reconstruction","272593588_Fitting_the_Gene_Lineage_into_its_Species_Lineage_a_Parsimony_Strategy_Illustrated_by_Cladograms_Constructed_from_Globin_Sequences","264935741_A_promoter-level_mammalian_expression_atlas_Nature_507_462-70_doi_101038nature13182","249276420_Maps_Between_Trees_And_Cladistic_Analysis_Of_Historical_Associations_Among_Genes_Organisms_And_Areas"]}
