{"id":"356547761_Generative_adversarial_networks_in_medical_image_segmentation_A_review","abstract":"Purpose\nSince Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was introduced into the field of deep learning in 2014, it has received extensive attention from academia and industry, and a lot of high-quality papers have been published. GAN effectively improves the accuracy of medical image segmentation because of its good generating ability and capability to capture data distribution. This paper introduces the origin, working principle, and extended variant of GAN, and it reviews the latest development of GAN-based medical image segmentation methods.\n\nMethod\nTo find the papers, we searched on Google Scholar and PubMed with the keywords like “segmentation”, “medical image”, and “GAN (or generative adversarial network)”. Also, additional searches were performed on Semantic Scholar, Springer, arXiv, and the top conferences in computer science with the above keywords related to GAN.\n\nResults\nWe reviewed more than 120 GAN-based architectures for medical image segmentation that were published before September 2021. We categorized and summarized these papers according to the segmentation regions, imaging modality, and classification methods. Besides, we discussed the advantages, challenges, and future research directions of GAN in medical image segmentation.\n\nConclusions\nWe discussed in detail the recent papers on medical image segmentation using GAN. The application of GAN and its extended variants has effectively improved the accuracy of medical image segmentation. Obtaining the recognition of clinicians and patients and overcoming the instability, low repeatability, and uninterpretability of GAN will be an important research direction in the future.","authors":["Siyi Xun","Dengwang Li","Hui Zhu","Min Chen"],"meta":["November 2021Computers in Biology and Medicine 140:105063","DOI:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.105063"],"references":["354519522_Deep_generative_models_for_automated_muscle_segmentation_in_computed_tomography_scanning","354440456_IAS-NET_Joint_Intra-classly_Adaptive_GAN_and_Segmentation_network_for_unsupervised_cross-domain_in_Neonatal_Brain_MRI_segmentation","354195746_Lung_nodule_segmentation_using_Salp_Shuffled_Shepherd_Optimization_Algorithm-based_Generative_Adversarial_Network","354057803_Realistic_Image_Normalization_for_Multi-Domain_Segmentation","353843442_S-CUDA_Self-Cleansing_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_for_Medical_Image_Segmentation","353827066_Scalable_quorum-based_deep_neural_networks_with_adversarial_learning_for_automated_lung_lobe_segmentation_in_fast_helical_free-breathing_CTs","353710047_Bidirectional_cross-modality_unsupervised_domain_adaptation_using_generative_adversarial_networks_for_cardiac_image_segmentation","353316021_Dual_adversarial_convolutional_networks_with_multi-level_cues_for_pancreatic_segmentation","353153133_Multi-discriminator_adversarial_convolutional_network_for_nerve_fiber_segmentation_in_confocal_corneal_microscopy_images","352884940_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_to_Synthesize_Missing_T1_and_FLAIR_MRI_Sequences_for_Use_in_a_Multisequence_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_Model","351892278_Generative_Adversarial_Network_Based_Automatic_Segmentation_of_Corneal_Subbasal_Nerves_on_In_Vivo_Confocal_Microscopy_Images","351350190_JAS-GAN_Generative_Adversarial_Network_Based_Joint_Atrium_and_Scar_Segmentation_on_Unbalanced_Atrial_Targets","352770729_Weakly_Supervised_Anomaly_Segmentation_in_Retinal_OCT_Images_Using_An_Adversarial_Learning_Approach","351593985_Abdominal_multi-organ_segmentation_with_cascaded_convolutional_and_adversarial_deep_networks","351070161_Axial-SpineGAN_simultaneous_segmentation_and_diagnosis_of_multiple_spinal_structures_on_axial_magnetic_resonance_imaging_images"]}
