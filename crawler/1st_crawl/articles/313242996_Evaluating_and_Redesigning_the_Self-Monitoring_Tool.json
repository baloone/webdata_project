{"id":"313242996_Evaluating_and_Redesigning_the_Self-Monitoring_Tool","abstract":"In order to facilitate self-monitoring interventions designed by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, a web-based self-monitoring tool was created. This paper aims to evaluate the tool regarding its usability and user-experiences prior to its wide adoption. The User-Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to evaluate the self-monitoring tool. The tool was implemented in a Human-Computer Interaction course during odd semesters and the evaluations were taken by the participants of the course. The evaluation results were analyzed to help determine whether the tool needs to be enhanced or improved. Based the results, a new design of self-monitoring tool was developed using the interface design principles.","authors":["Harry B.
