{"id":"353105178_Follow_the_white_robot_Efficacy_of_robot-assistive_training_for_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorder","abstract":"Background\nSocially assistive robots have the potential to become a powerful therapeutic tool for individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, to date, only a few studies explored the efficacy of robot-assisted training embedded in structured clinical protocols. The current study aimed at investigating the beneficial effects of introducing a toy robot, as a new tool for clinicians, in the treatment plan carried out by an Italian healthcare institution.\n\nMethod\nIn collaboration with the healthcare professionals of Piccolo Cottolengo Genovese di Don Orione, we designed a robot-mediated activity aimed at improving social skills in children with ASD. Twenty-four children with ASD (Age = 5.79 Â± 1.02, 5 females) completed the activities with the robot in a cross-over design, during a period of ten weeks. Their social skills were assessed before and after the robot intervention activities, using the Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS).\n\nResults\nResults showed that the combination of robot-assisted training with standard therapy was more effective than the standard therapy alone, in terms of improvement of social skills. Specifically, after the robot-assisted training, children with ASD improved in their ability to generate and respond to behavioral requests, and in their tendency to initiate and maintain social interaction with the adult.\n\nConclusions\nOur results support the idea that robot-assisted interventions can be combined with the standard treatment plan to improve clinical outcomes.","authors":["Davide Ghiglino","Pauline Chevalier","Federica Floris","Tiziana Priolo"],"meta":["August 2021Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders
