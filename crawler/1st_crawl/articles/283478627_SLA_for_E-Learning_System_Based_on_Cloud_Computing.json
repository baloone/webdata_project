{"id":"283478627_SLA_for_E-Learning_System_Based_on_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"The Service Level Agreement (SLA) becomes an important issue especially over the Cloud Computing and online services that based on the ‘pay-as-you-use’ fashion. Establishing the Service level agreements (SLAs), which can be defined as a negotiation between the service provider and the user, is needed for many types of current applications as the E-Learning systems. The work in this paper presents an idea of optimizing the SLA parameters to serve any E-Learning system over the Cloud Computing platform, with defining the negotiation process, the suitable frame work, and the sequence diagram to accommodate the E-Learning systems.","authors":["Doaa Elmatary","Samy Abd","Wael Awad","Fatma Abd El-Sattar Omara"],"meta":["October 2015International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 6(10)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2015.061027"],"references":["309822023_Cloud_Computing_Services_A_Survey","254035330_Cloud_computing_-_concepts_architecture_and_challenges","225252747_Cloud_Computing_State-of-the-art_and_Research_Challenges","272912305_Implementation_of_Cloud_Computing_in_Education_-_A_Revolution","266646567_The_SLA_Evaluation_Model_for_Cloud_Computing","247560605_SNAP_A_Protocol_for_Negotiation_of_Service_Level_Agreements_and_Coordinated_Resource_Management_in","228577884_Measuring_the_efficiency_of_cloud_computing_for_E-learning_systems","224185363_Conceptual_SLA_framework_for_cloud_computing","224172259_Cloud_Computing_The_New_Frontier_of_Internet_Computing","224142297_Cloud_Computing_Issues_and_Challenges"]}
