{"id":"228889087_An_agent-oriented_architecture_for_holonic_manufacturing_control","abstract":"Many manufacturing paradigms promise to meet the challenges of the next century much better than present approaches do. Two of these paradigms, holonic and agent-oriented manufacturing, have received a lot of attention in academia and industry lately. Their visions, however, have many concepts in common, such as autonomy, cooperation, and self-organization. In order to assess the difference between both paradigms, this paper compares the ideas and concepts of holonic and agent-oriented manufacturing. It will show that both paradigms have different, but compatible views on manufacturing control and that a combination is benefi-cial to both paradigms. To support this thesis, the use of agent technology to design and implement the information processing in a holonic manufacturing system is discussed.","authors":["Stefan Bussmann"],"meta":["January 1998"],"references":["236897613_Design_of_an_Intelligent_Manufacturing_Cell","234125565_Holonic_Manufacturing_Systems_Initial_Architecture_and_Standards_Directions","220908031_A_Multi-Agent_Approach_to_Dynamic_Adaptive_Scheduling_of_Material_Flow","220816423_Decision-Making_in_an_Embedded_Reasoning_System","37685286_Distributed_Negotiation-based_Task_Planning_for_a_flexible_Manufacturing_Environment","2691448_Holonic_Planning_and_Scheduling_for_a_Robotic_Assembly_Testbed","248897153_The_Design_of_Intelligent_Agents_-_A_Layered_Approach","243699419_The_IMS_International_Collaborative_Program","238997605_Manufacturing_Experience_with_the_Contract_Net","234800312_Organizational_intelligence_and_distributed_artificial_intelligence","224388372_An_Architecture_for_Heuristic_Factory_Control","220907995_Generic_Configurable_Cooperation_Protocols_for_Multi-Agent_Systems","220838548_Controlling_Distributed_Manufacturing_Systems_by_a_Market_Mechanism","220809868_Task_Bidding_and_Distributed_Planning_in_Flexible_Manufacturing","220809857_Fractal_Actors_for_Distributed_Manufacturing_Control","3600620_Holonic_control_of_a_water_cooling_system_for_a_steel_rod_mill","3600612_Results_of_the_holonic_control_system_benchmark_at_KU_Leuven","2597264_Intelligent_Agents_Theory_and_Practice","2586664_THE_DESIGN_OF_AN_INTELLIGENT_MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM_-_A_Multi-Agent_System_Approach","2428123_Understanding_the_Emergence_of_Conventions_in_Multi-Agent_Systems"]}
