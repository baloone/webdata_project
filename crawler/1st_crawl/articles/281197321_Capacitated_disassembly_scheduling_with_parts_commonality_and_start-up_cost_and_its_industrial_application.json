{"id":"281197321_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_with_parts_commonality_and_start-up_cost_and_its_industrial_application","abstract":"This paper discusses the capacitated disassembly scheduling with parts commonality and start-up cost, which has broad applications in remanufacturing and many other production systems. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model. A Lagrangian heuristic is developed, where the lower bound problem reduces to a linear model, and the upper bound can be obtained with a two-stage procedure in polynomial time. The algorithm is tested on randomly generated problems. The results reveal that the approach outperforms CPLEX significantly for all the test instances, and for real-scale problem it provides sufficiently good solutions within acceptable time. Sensitivity studies on capacity, parts commonality and start-up cost are also conducted, which provide some useful insights for industrial managers. Moreover, a real-world case from a valve disassembly factory is studied, which illustrates the application of the proposed approach and gives managerial insights. Finally, conclusions are drawn and some potential extensions are discussed.","authors":["Xiaocong Ji","Zhi-Hai Zhang","Simin Huang","Lefei Li"],"meta":["June 2015International Journal of Production Research 54(4):1-19","DOI:10.1080/00207543.2015.1058536","Project: closed-loop supply chain"],"references":["329862999_A_sample_average_approximation_method_for_disassembly_line_balancing_problem_under_uncertainty","276336372_Generating_complete_disassembly_sequences_by_utilising_two-dimensional_views","271819386_Partial_disassembly_sequencing_considering_acquired_end-of-life_product_age_distributions","271710761_A_network-based_shortest_route_model_for_parallel_disassembly_line_balancing_problem","292664141_Disassembly_Scheduling_with_Parts_Commonality_Using_Petri_Nets_with_Timestamps","287561380_Remanufacturing_scheduling_systems_an_exploratory_analysis_comparing_academic_research_and_industry_practice","287321479_Advanced_disassembly_planning_Flexible_price-quantity_dependent_and_multi-period_planning_approaches","279049797_The_Lagrangian_Relaxation_Method_for_Solving_Integer_Programming_Problems","278090826_Optimal_maintenance_scheduling_for_a_complex_manufacturing_system_subject_to_deterioration","270724886_Demand-driven_disassembly_optimization_for_electronic_products"]}
