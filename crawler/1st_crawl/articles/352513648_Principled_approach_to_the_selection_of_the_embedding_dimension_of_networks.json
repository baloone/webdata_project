{"id":"352513648_Principled_approach_to_the_selection_of_the_embedding_dimension_of_networks","abstract":"Network embedding is a general-purpose machine learning technique that encodes network structure in vector spaces with tunable dimension. Choosing an appropriate embedding dimension – small enough to be efficient and large enough to be effective – is challenging but necessary to generate embeddings applicable to a multitude of tasks. Existing strategies for the selection of the embedding dimension rely on performance maximization in downstream tasks. Here, we propose a principled method such that all structural information of a network is parsimoniously encoded. The method is validated on various embedding algorithms and a large corpus of real-world networks. The embedding dimension selected by our method in real-world networks suggest that efficient encoding in low-dimensional spaces is usually possible. Network embedding is a machine learning technique for construction of low-dimensional representations of large networks. Gu et al. propose a method for the identification of an optimal embedding dimension for the encoding of network structural information inspired by natural language processing.","authors":["Weiwei Gu","Aditya Tandon","Yong-Yeol Ahn","Filippo Radicchi"],"meta":["June 2021Nature Communications 12(1):3772","DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-23795-5"],"references":["339647126_The_impossibility_of_low-rank_representations_for_triangle-rich_complex_networks","327295865_Characterizing_the_Analogy_Between_Hyperbolic_Embedding_and_Community_Structure_of_Complex_Networks","326202548_Adversarially_Regularized_Graph_Autoencoder_for_Graph_Embedding","321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","319896834_Representation_Learning_on_Graphs_Methods_and_Applications","334715322_Graph_Recurrent_Networks_With_Attributed_Random_Walks","334115961_SemAxis_A_Lightweight_Framework_to_Characterize_Domain-Specific_Word_Semantics_Beyond_Sentiment","324055041_The_Geometry_of_Culture_Analyzing_Meaning_through_Word_Embeddings","322969719_Multi-Dimensional_Network_Embedding_with_Hierarchical_Structure","321241613_Word_Embeddings_Quantify_100_Years_of_Gender_and_Ethnic_Stereotypes"]}
