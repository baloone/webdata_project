{"id":"320722921_Automatic_Software_Repair_A_Survey","abstract":"Despite their growing complexity and increasing size, modern software applications must satisfy strict release requirements that impose short bug fixing and maintenance cycles, putting significant pressure on the developers who are responsible for timely producing high-quality software. To reduce developers workload, repairing and healing techniques have been extensively investigated as solutions for efficiently repairing and maintaining software in the last few years. In particular, repairing solutions have been able to automatically produce useful fixes for several classes of bugs that might be present in software programs.","authors":["Luca Gazzola","Daniela Micucci","Leonardo Mariani"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSE.2017.2755013"],"references":["345843594_Reversible_Debugging_Software_Quantify_the_time_and_cost_saved_using_reversible_debuggers","318294553_Policy_Enforcement_with_Proactive_Libraries","309327927_On_the_evaluation_of_automatic_program_repair_techniques_and_tools","317919488_Verified_Models_and_Reference_Implementations_for_the_TLS_13_Standard_Candidate","310821492_Understanding_and_generating_high_quality_patches_for_concurrency_bugs","308868848_CARAMEL_Detecting_and_Fixing_Performance_Problems_That_Have_Non-Intrusive_Fixes","308858592_Safe_Memory-Leak_Fixing_for_C_Programs","308851249_Automated_Program_Repair_in_an_Integrated_Development_Environment","308729036_Toward_improving_graftability_on_automated_program_repair","307091061_BovInspector_automatic_inspection_and_repair_of_buffer_overflow_vulnerabilities"]}
