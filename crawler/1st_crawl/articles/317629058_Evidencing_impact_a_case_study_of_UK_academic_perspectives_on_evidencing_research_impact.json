Articulating the Public Value of Academic Research.” Tertiary Education and Management 18 (2): 115–30). This article takes a case study approach, examining one university faculty in depth in relation to research impact. Comprising an analysis of 18 Research Excellence Framework impact case studies submitted by the faculty in 2014, alongside a survey of 68 faculty staff and PhD students, and interviews with four research centre or group leaders, the case study explores the perceived benefits and challenges of evidencing research impact amongst a range of disciplines, as well as the ‘transferable’ skills which researchers utilise in evidence gathering.","authors":["Clare Wilkinson"],"meta":["June 2017Studies in Higher Education 44(1):1-14","DOI:10.1080/03075079.2017.1339028"],"references":["303872272_Measuring_the_Impact_of_Research_Lessons_from_the_UK's_Research_Excellence_Framework_2014","297202939_Beyond_REF_2014_The_impact_of_impact_assessment_on_the_future_of_information_research","282806884_Assessing_and_Maximizing_the_Impact_of_the_Social_Sciences_A_British_Perspective","281742077_Progressing_research_impact_assessment_A_'contributions'_approach","280570677_Publishing_and_perishing_an_academic_literacies_framework_for_investigating_research_productivity","303979068_Impact_case_studies_submitted_to_REF_2014_The_hidden_impact_of_nursing_research","301481343_Selling_'impact'_peer_reviewer_projections_of_what_is_needed_and_what_counts_in_REF_impact_case_studies_A_retrospective_analysis","295871308_Artifice_or_integrity_in_the_marketization_of_research_impact_Investigating_the_moral_economy_of_pathways_to_impact_statements_within_research_funding_proposals_in_the_UK_and_Australia","284338246_Global_transition_and_teacher_professionalism","282163277_The_Impact_Market"]}
