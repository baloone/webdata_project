{"id":"284219406_Geometric_analysis_of_pathways_dynamics_application_to_versatility_of_TGF-beta_receptors","abstract":"We propose a new geometric approach to describe the qualitative dynamics of\nchemical reactions networks. By this method we identify metastable regimes,\ndefined as low dimensional regions of the phase space close to which the\ndynamics is much slower compared to the rest of the phase space. Given the\nnetwork topology and the orders of magnitude of kinetic parameters, the number\nof such metastable regimes is finite. The dynamics of the network can be\ndescribed as a sequence of jumps from one metastable regime to another. We show\nthat a geometrically computed connectivity graph restricts the set of possible\njumps. We also provide finite state machine (Markov chain) models for such\ndynamic changes. Applied to signal transduction models, our approach unravels\ndynamical and functional capacities of signaling pathways, as well as\nparameters responsible for specificity of the pathway response. In particular,\nfor a model of TGF$\\beta$ signalling, we find that the ratio of TGFBR1 to\nTGFBR2 concentrations can be used to discriminate between metastable regimes.\nUsing expression data from the NCI60 panel of human tumor cell lines, we show\nthat aggressive and non-aggressive tumour cell lines function in different\nmetastable regimes and can be distinguished by measuring the relative\nconcentrations of receptors of the two types.\nopen access link : http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264716301174","authors":["Satya Swarup Samal","Aurélien Naldi","Dima Grigoriev","Andreas Günter Weber"],"meta":["November 2015Bio Systems 149","DOI:10.1016/j.biosystems.2016.07.004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282997153_A_Geometric_Method_for_Model_Reduction_of_Biochemical_Networks_with_Polynomial_Rate_Functions","282278566_The_Disintegrin_and_Metalloprotease_ADAM12_Is_Associated_with_TGF-b-Induced_Epithelial_to_Mesenchymal_Transition","281262330_Analysis_of_Reaction_Network_Systems_Using_Tropical_Geometry","280042375_Symbolic_Dynamics_of_Biochemical_Pathways_as_Finite_States_Machines","279988630_Geometry_of_the_Gene_Expression_Space_of_Individual_Cells","273157725_Model_Reduction_of_Biochemical_Reactions_Networks_by_Tropical_Analysis_Methods","259893563_A_Constraint_Solving_Approach_to_Model_Reduction_by_Tropical_Equilibration","301232961_Dynamical_principles_in_neuroscience","270281541_A_tropical_method_based_on_Newton_polygon_approach_for_algebraic_analysis_of_biochemical_reaction_networks","256497738_Dynamic_and_Static_Limitation_in_Reaction_Networks_revisited"]}
