{"id":"317696965_New_Paper_The_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_high_school_students'_reasoning_skills_and_self-efficacy_and_problem_solving_in_Mathematics","abstract":"In this paper we investigate whether computer programming has an impact on high school student’s reasoning skills, problem solving and self-efficacy in Mathematics. The quasi-experimental design was adopted to implement the study. The sample of the research comprised 66 high school students separated into two groups, the experimental and the control group according to their educational orientation. The research findings indicate that there is a significant difference in the reasoning skills of students that participated in the “programming course” compared to students that did not. Moreover, the self-efficacy indicator of students that participated in the experimental group showed a significant difference from students in the control group. The results however, failed to support the hypothesis that computer programming significantly enhances student’s problem solving skills.","authors":["Sarantos Psycharis","Maria Kallia"],"meta":["October 2017Instructional Science 45(5):583–602","DOI:10.1007/s11251-017-9421-5"],"references":["352288377_Establishing_a_Benchmark_for_the_Deductive_Reasoning_Abilities_of_United_Arab_Emirates_University_Business_Students","288928296_The_effect_of_web-based_mathematics_instruction_on_mathematics_achievement_attitudes_anxiety_and_self-efficacy_of_6th_grade_students","348867655_Mathematics_Education_Models_and_Processes","329654173_Changing_Minds_Computers_Learning_and_Literacy","317953379_Historical_perspectives_on_problem_solving_in_the_mathematics_curriculum","313037166_Social_cognitive_theory_and_self-regulated_learning","306201541_Learning_with_technology_using_computers_as_cognitive_tools","296337709_Self-efficacy_beliefs_of_adolescents","288842196_Problem_solving_and_modeling","288069112_Combining_Problem-Solving_Instruction_and_Programming_Instruction_to_Increase_the_Problem-Solving_Ability_of_High_School_Students","287346897_The_Impact_of_Computational_Experiment_and_Formative_Assessment_in_Inquiry-Based_Teaching_and_Learning_Approach_in_STEM_Education","286151865_The_wild_wild_wild_wild_wild_world_of_problem_solving_A_review_of_sorts","284504019_Problems_with_problem-based_learning_Comments_on_model-centered_learning_and_instruction_in_Seel_2003","281345345_Optimum_Experimental_Designs","280321247_Understanding_Computational_Thinking_before_Programming"]}
