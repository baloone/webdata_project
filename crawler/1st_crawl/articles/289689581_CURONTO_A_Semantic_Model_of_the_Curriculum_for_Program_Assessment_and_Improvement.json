{"id":"289689581_CURONTO_A_Semantic_Model_of_the_Curriculum_for_Program_Assessment_and_Improvement","abstract":"The Continuous Improvement Process (CIP) of an academic program in higher education is a tedious and time consuming task. Updating any part in the curriculum requires a thorough review of all the related and subsequent courses. Since 2008 the B.Sc. program of Information Technology (BSIT) in King Saud University (KSU), has initiated a CIP based on outcomes of both course and program levels in response to ABET accreditation requirements. To ensure the program delivers its educational objectives and student outcomes through a well-designed curriculum, we propose, in this paper, a semantic representation to model a complete curriculum using OWL ontology. Using such representation permits a global view of the internal relations and dependencies within elements of a curriculum and hence enables the CIP to be carried out easily.","authors":["Auhood Abdullah Alfaries","Maha Al-yahya","Henda Chorfi","Remya P George"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Engineering Education 30(5):1083-1094"],"references":["228857266_A_survey_of_ontology_evaluation_techniques","226279556_What_Is_an_Ontology","220374630_Developing_Domain_Ontologies_for_Course_Content","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","230124777_A_model_for_facilitating_curriculum_development_in_higher_education_A_faculty-driven_data-informed_and_educational_developer-supported_approach","220830316_Ontology_Evaluation_through_Usability_Measures"]}
