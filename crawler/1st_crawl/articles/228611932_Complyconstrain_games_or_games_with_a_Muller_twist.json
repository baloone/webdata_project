{"id":"228611932_Complyconstrain_games_or_games_with_a_Muller_twist","abstract":"In this paper we call attention to a category of combinatorial games, which we call comply/constrain games or games with a Muller twist. We say that we put a Muller twist on a familiar game if we modify that game so that each move in the familiar game is followed by a constraint on the next player's move. We solve Odd-or-Even Nim, which is a variant of Nim with the Muller twist that each player specifies whether their opponent's next removal is to be of an odd or even number of objects, solve a generalization of Tall-or-Short Wyt Queens, which puts a Muller twist on Wyt Queens, report some results for Fibonacci-or-Not Nim, which is a take-away game in which the possible constraints are that the number removed be a Fibonacci number or not, and propose some other games, such as Nought-or-Cross.","authors":["Furman Smith","Pantelimon St˘ Anic˘"],"meta":["January 2002"],"references":["267089905_Partizan_and_impartial_combinatorial_games","265423473_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_IV_3_parts","242385361_Blocking_Combinatorial_Games","242383393_New_mathematical_diversions_from_Scientific_American","236853724_Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays","234370523_Knotted_Doughnuts_and_Other_Mathematical_Entertainments","39765370_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_vol_1_Fundamental_Algorithms","37692925_Hexaflexagons_and_Other_Mathematical_Diversions_The_First_Scientific_American_Book_of_Puzzles_and_Games","36966588_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_1_Fundamental_algorithms"]}
