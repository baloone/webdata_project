{"id":"342678200_Data_Science","abstract":"The presence of new science does not necessarily occur just like that. Every science starts from interests, discussion, and looks for a basic foundation, but in general the main foundation of science is mathematics. Data science includes structured and systematic knowledge about data. However, many other sciences that has a relationship with the data in question, ranging from statistics to computer science. This paper aims to reveal the obstacle and limitations of other science into a data science completely, on that basis the definition of data sciences needs to be elaborated, then confirm data science as new science and not depend directly on several other sciences.","authors":["Mahyuddin K.
