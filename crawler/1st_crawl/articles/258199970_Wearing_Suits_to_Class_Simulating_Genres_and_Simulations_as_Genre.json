{"id":"258199970_Wearing_Suits_to_Class_Simulating_Genres_and_Simulations_as_Genre","abstract":"Using the theoretical perspective offered by recent genre studies, this study compares student and professional discourse within the same field through a set of case studies written for a third-year course in financial analysisâ€”writing that was conceived and designed by the instructor to simulate workplace discourse. Observational and textual analyses revealed the radically distinct social action undertaken in this student writing as compared to related workplace discourse, despite the simulation. Social motives, exigent rhetorical contexts, social roles, and reading practices were all distinct in ways that profoundly affected both discourse processes and products. At the same time, certain commonalities were apparent in the student and workplace writing. These shared features point to ways in which student writing enables and enacts entry into sociocultural communities.","authors":["AVIVA FREEDMAN","CHRISTINE ADAM","Graham Smart"],"meta":["April 1994Written Communication 11(2):193-226","DOI:10.1177/0741088394011002002"],"references":["258199967_Records_as_Genre","249738642_Essayist_Literacy_and_Other_Verbal_Performances","249738419_Physicists_Reading_Physics_Schema-Laden_Purposes_and_Purpose-Laden_Schema","243782627_A_Social-Interactive_Model_of_Writing","238749675_Genre_as_Social_Action","277391692_Writing_in_the_College_Years_Some_Indices_of_Growth","274814943_Rhetoric_Innovation_Technology","272929910_Generalizing_about_Genre_New_Conceptions_of_an_Old_Concept","272928398_Teaching_Discourse_and_Reproducing_Culture_A_Critique_of_Research_and_Pedagogy_in_Professional_and_Non-Academic_Writing","272928298_Writing_Teaching_and_Learning_in_the_Disciplines","254311897_Essayist_literacy_and_the_rhetoric_of_deproduction","249730716_Power_Relations_Technical_Writing_Theory_and_Workplace_Writing","248056274_The_Uses_of_Argument","242421672_Writer-Based_Prose_A_Cognitive_Basis_for_Problems_in_Writing","240711327_Rethinking_Genre_from_a_Sociocognitive_Perspective"]}
