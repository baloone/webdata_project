{"id":"277962219_Analysis_of_an_Advisor-Advisee_Relationship_An_Exploratory_Study_of_the_Area_of_Exact_and_Earth_Sciences_in_Brazil","abstract":"been adopted to address the question of how collaboration has evolved in terms of publication output, numbers of coauthors, and multidisciplinary trends. One particular type of collaboration that has received very little attention concerns advisor and advisee relationships. In this paper, we examine this relationship for the researchers who are involved in the area of Exact and Earth Sciences in Brazil and its eight subareas. These pairs are registered in the Lattes Platform that manages the individual curricula vitae of Brazilian researchers. The individual features of these academic researchers and their coauthoring relationships were investigated. We have found evidence that there exists positive correlation between time of advisor–advisee relationship with the advisee’s productivity. Additionally, there has been a gradual decline in advisor–advisee coauthoring over a number of years as measured by the Kulczynski index, which could be interpreted as decline of the dependence.","authors":["Esteban F Tuesta","Karina Delgado","Rogerio Mugnaini","Luciano A.
