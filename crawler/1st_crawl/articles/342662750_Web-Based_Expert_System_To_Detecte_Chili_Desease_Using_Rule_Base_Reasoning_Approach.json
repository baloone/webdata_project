{"id":"342662750_Web-Based_Expert_System_To_Detecte_Chili_Desease_Using_Rule_Base_Reasoning_Approach","abstract":"Along with the progress of global Era, the development of science is also growing rapidly especially for the progression of technology, information and communication. Artificial intelligence is part of computer science specifically aimed for designing intelligent automation of behavior in system of computer intelligence. Expert system as part of the application of artificial intelligence is for combining knowledge, facts and search technique to solve the problem that normally requires expertise from an expert. One of directions from the system of expert in agriculture is the system expert for detecting diseases of chili plant. In this study, the expert system was designed to detect disease of chili plants on web-based using the rule-based reasoning approach method, because the method can decide a disease of chili plant with a set of facts - symptoms or symptoms that exist in a sequential manner and this approach can also provide an explanation of the steps in achieving the solution for the disease. Web-Based Expert System To Detecte Chili Desease Using Rule Base Reasoning Approach is expected to solve the problems in agriculture quickly, precisely and accurately especially for the chiliâ€™s farmer.","authors":["Suhartini","Intan komala dewi","Lalu Kerta Wijaya"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1539(1):012026","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1539/1/012026"],"references":["283170856_Swine-Vet_A_Web-based_Expert_System_of_Swine_Disease_Diagnosis","257945102_A_Novel_Web-based_Human_Advisor_Fuzzy_Expert_System","257743661_Verifying_regional_climate_model_results_with_web-based_expert-system","338308078_Investigation_and_analysis_of_relationship_between_mineral_elements_alteration_and_cork_spot_physiological_disorder_of_Chinese_pear_'Chili'_Pyrus_bretschneideri_Rehd","337928171_High-humidity_hot_air_impingement_blanching_HHAIB_efficiently_inactivates_enzymes_enhances_extraction_of_phytochemicals_and_mitigates_brown_actions_of_Chili_pepper","337749789_Determination_of_Sudan_dyes_in_chili_products_by_micellar_electrokinetic_chromatography-MSMS_using_a_volatile_surfactant","337070426_The_effectiveness_of_chemical_solutions_on_the_removal_of_carbaryl_residues_from_Cucumber_and_Chili_presoaked_in_carbaryl_using_the_HPLC_technique","334280557_Magnetic_naphthalene-based_polyimide_polymer_for_extraction_of_Sudan_dyes_in_chili_sauce","328833621_Perception_and_Liking_of_Soups_Flavored_with_Chipotle_Chili_and_Ginger_Extracts_Effects_of_PROP_Taster_Status_Personality_Traits_and_Emotions","257549398_A_web-based_fuzzy_expert_system_for_frost_warnings_in_horticultural_crops","223754681_Fish-Expert_A_web-based_expert_system_for_fish_disease_diagnosis","223621524_A_web-based_expert_system_to_assess_the_complexity_of_manufacturing_organizations","222793562_Web-based_expert_system_for_food_dryer_selection","222334513_An_integrated_approach_of_MAS-CommonKADS_Model-View-Controller_and_web_application_optimization_strategies_for_web-based_expert_system_development","222003398_A_Web-enabled_hybrid_approach_to_strategic_marketing_planning_Group_Delphia_Web-based_expert_system"]}
