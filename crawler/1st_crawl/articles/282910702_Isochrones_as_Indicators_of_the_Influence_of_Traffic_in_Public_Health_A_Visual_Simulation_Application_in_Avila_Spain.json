{"id":"282910702_Isochrones_as_Indicators_of_the_Influence_of_Traffic_in_Public_Health_A_Visual_Simulation_Application_in_Avila_Spain","abstract":"It is well known that excessive rescue times after traffic accidents negatively affect the health of those injured. There is a need to quantitatively measure the impact of unexpected events like ambulance availability, weather, floating population and congestion in those rescue times. A family of indicators based on isochrones is disguised and proposed to understand the risk of the whole population as the probability of not being assisted on time. Indicators of health risk for local towns are also defined. The indicators are calculated using a simulation model and visualized in web format. The framework of analysis is validated using Ávila (Spain) and the problem of the optimal deployment of ambulances as a test-bench.","authors":["Javier Otamendi","David García-Heredia"],"meta":["October 2015International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 12(10):12556-12576","DOI:10.3390/ijerph121012556"],"references":["277342623_Assessing_Traffic_Accident_Occurrence_of_Road_Segments_through_an_Optimized_Decision_Rule","273525260_Cost-effective_analyses_for_emergency_medical_services_deployment_A_case_study_in_Shanghai","271225303_Managing_emergency_department_overcrowding_via_ambulance_diversion_A_discrete_event_simulation_model","277253888_Assessing_traffic_and_industrial_contributions_to_ambient_nitrogen_dioxide_and_volatile_organic_compounds_in_a_low_pollution_urban_environment","276071339_Economic_cost_of_permanent_disability_caused_by_road_traffic_injuries_in_Mexico_in_2012","268128719_Joint_Analysis_of_Queuing_Delays_Associated_With_Secondary_Incidents","263127231_A_simulation_study_to_improve_the_performance_of_an_emergency_medical_service_Application_to_the_French_Val-de-Marne_department","262921633_Two_New_Models_for_Redeployment_of_Ambulances","262193428_A_cross-cultural_analysis_of_aggressive_driving_Evidence_from_Serbia_and_Romania","262044919_Reducing_Ambulance_Response_Times_Using_Discrete_Event_Simulation"]}
