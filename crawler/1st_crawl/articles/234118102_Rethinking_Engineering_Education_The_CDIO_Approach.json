{"id":"234118102_Rethinking_Engineering_Education_The_CDIO_Approach","abstract":"This book describes an approach to engineering education that integrates a comprehensive set of personal and interpersonal skills, and process, product, and system building skills with disciplinary knowledge. The education of engineers is set in the context of engineering practice, that is, Conceiving, Designing, Implementing, and Operating (CDIO) through the entire lifecycle of engineering processes, products, and processes. The book is both a description of the development and implementation of the CDIO model, and a guide to engineering programmers worldwide who seek to improve their programs.","authors":["Edward F.
