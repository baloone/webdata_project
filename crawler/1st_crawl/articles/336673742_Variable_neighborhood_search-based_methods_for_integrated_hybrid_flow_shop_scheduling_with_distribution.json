{"id":"336673742_Variable_neighborhood_search-based_methods_for_integrated_hybrid_flow_shop_scheduling_with_distribution","abstract":"With the rapid development of make-to-order pattern including E-commerce and takeout and catering service in restaurants, the study of integrated scheduling and distribution receives more and more attentions. Based on a practical order picking and distribution system, a three-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with distribution is studied. Each order is processed on the hybrid flow shop which consists of identical parallel machines with sequence-dependent setup times at stage 1, identical parallel machines at stage 2 and dedicated machines at stage 3, followed by a multi-trip traveling salesman problem with capacitated vehicles for customers of different destination areas. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the maximum delivery completion time. A variable neighborhood search (VNS)-based method, a four-layered constructive heuristic method (denoted by \\(CH_{VNS}\\)) and a hybrid heuristic method (denoted by \\(CONS_{VNS}\\)) which combines the VNS method and the \\(CH_{VNS}\\) method are developed to solve the problems with practical size. Computational experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.","authors":["Shijin Wang","Ruochen Wu","Feng Chu","Jianbo Yu"],"meta":["June 2020Soft Computing 24(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-019-04420-6"],"references":["332335539_Continuous-time_scheduling_of_production_distribution_and_sales_in_photovoltaic_supply_chains_with_declining_prices","328888540_Integrated_Production_Scheduling_and_Distribution_Planning_with_Time_Windows_Optimization_Models_and_Algorithms","326463059_Same-Day_Delivery_with_Pickup_Stations_and_Autonomous_Vehicles","320581351_Integrated_supply_chain_network_planning_and_financial_planning_respecting_the_imperfection_of_the_capital_market","333425471_An_integrated_production_scheduling_and_delivery_route_planning_with_multi-purpose_machines_A_case_study_from_a_furniture_manufacturing_company","330048733_Integrated_production_scheduling_and_distribution_planning_with_time_windows","328312712_Integrated_Production_and_Multiple_Trips_Vehicle_Routing_with_Time_Windows_and_Uncertain_Travel_Times","326400049_Integrated_multi-factory_production_and_distribution_scheduling_applying_vehicle_routing_approach","321750124_A_hybrid_variable_neighborhood_search_algorithm_for_the_hot_rolling_batch_scheduling_problem_in_compact_strip_production","320039849_A_coordinated_algorithm_for_integrated_production_scheduling_and_vehicle_routing_problem","316002439_Integrated_production_scheduling_and_vehicle_routing_problem_with_job_splitting_and_delivery_time_windows","318045132_Permutation_Flow_Shop_Scheduling_With_Batch_Delivery_to_Multiple_Customers_in_Supply_Chains","317123149_The_Same-Day_Delivery_Problem_for_Online_Purchases","317108441_Toward_an_integrated_modeling_approach_for_production_and_delivery_operations_in_flow_shop_system_Trade-off_between_direct_and_routing_delivery_methods","315466504_A_Benders_decomposition-based_heuristic_for_a_production_and_outbound_distribution_scheduling_problem_with_strict_delivery_constraints"]}
