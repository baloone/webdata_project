{"id":"229566504_Planning_and_Optimization_of_a_Numerical_Control_Machine_in_a_Multiple_Response_Case","abstract":"This paper focuses on a specific case of experimental planning and optimization in a multiresponse case. Particularly, our attention is dedicated to a numerical control machine and our final goal is to improve this machine's measurement accuracy for a general dental implant. This work substantially aims at addressing two issues: the optimization methods in the presence of more response variables and the related problem of weighting according to the actual importance of these variables. About simultaneous optimization, we suggest an improvement by a new function which takes care of location and dispersion effects.
