{"id":"225941594_Improving_the_Space-Bounded_Version_of_Muchnik's_Conditional_Complexity_Theorem_via_Naive_Derandomization","abstract":"Many theorems about Kolmogorov complexity rely on existence of combinatorial objects with specific properties. Usually the\nprobabilistic method gives such objects with better parameters than explicit constructions do. But the probabilistic method\ndoes not give “effective” variants of such theorems, i.e. variants for resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. We show that\na “naive derandomization” approach of replacing these objects by the output of Nisan-Wigderson pseudo-random generator may\ngive polynomial-space variants of such theorems.\n\nSpecifically, we improve the preceding polynomial-space analogue of Muchnik’s conditional complexity theorem. I.e., for all\na and b there exists a program p of least possible length that transforms a to b and is simple conditional on b. Here all programs work in polynomial space and all complexities are measured with logarithmic accuracy instead of polylogarithmic\none in the previous work.","authors":["Daniil Musatov"],"meta":["June 2011Theory of Computing Systems 55(2):64-76","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-20712-9_6","SourcearXiv","Conference: Computer Science - Theory and Applications - 6th International Computer Science Symposium in Russia, CSR 2011, St. Petersburg, Russia, June 14-18, 2011.
