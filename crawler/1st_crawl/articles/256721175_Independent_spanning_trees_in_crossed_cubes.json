{"id":"256721175_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","abstract":"Multiple independent spanning trees (ISTs) can be used for data broadcasting in networks, which can provide advantageous performances, such as the enhancement of fault-tolerance, bandwidth, and security. However, there is a conjecture on the existence of ISTs in graphs: If a graph G is n-connected (n ⩾ 1), then there are n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in G. This conjecture has remained open for n ⩾ 5. The n-dimensional crossed cube CQn is a n-connected graph with various desirable properties, which is an important variant of the n-dimensional hypercube. In this paper, we study the existence and construction of ISTs in crossed cubes. We first give a proof of the existence of n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in CQn(n ⩾ 1). Then, we propose an O(N log2N) constructive algorithm, where N = 2n is the number of vertices in CQn.","authors":["Baolei Cheng","Jianxi Fan","Xiaohua Jia","Zhang shu Kui"],"meta":["June 2013Information Sciences 233:276–289","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2013.01.010"],"references":["228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","221450180_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Folded_Hypercubes","220587447_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Hypercubes","220329881_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Multidimensional_Torus_Networks","220149255_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_Gcd","220089257_Edge-fault-tolerant_hamiltonicity_of_locally_twisted_cubes_under_conditional_edge_faults","3301188_Reducing_the_Height_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Chordal_Rings","3300403_Edge_congestion_and_topological_properties_of_crossed_cubes","3300347_Fault-free_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_faulty_arrangement_graphs","3299614_The_crossed_cube_architecture_for_parallel_computing","3045079_Pancyclicity_on_the_Mbius_cube_with_both_faulty_nodes_and_faulty_edges","313755300_A_linear-time_algorithm_to_find_independent_spanning_trees_in_maximal_planar_graphs","287496671_Some_misunderstandings_on_the_new_generation_floating_population","279894561_On_the_fault-tolerant_Hamiltonicity_of_faulty_crossed_cubes","264859486_Conditional_Edge-Fault_Hamiltonicity_of_Matching_Composition_Networks","264719533_Three_tree-paths","242790259_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_GcdmdGcdmd_with_d2d2","227103332_Independent_trees_in_graphs","226950322_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_to_Find_Four_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Four-Connected_Planar_Graphs","223853286_Reliable_broadcasting_in_product_networks","223085074_Finding_nonseparating_induced_cycles_and_independent_spanning_trees_in_3-connected_graphs","222865638_Topological_properties_of_the_crossed_cube_architecture","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","221450091_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_for_Hypercubes_and_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","220908199_Hamiltonicity_of_Matching_Composition_Networks_with_Conditional_Edge_Faults","220753037_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_to_Find_Four_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Four-Connected_Planar_Graphs","220752925_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Product_Graphs","220752486_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_to_Find_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Maximal_Planar_Graphs","220618379_Finding_Four_Independent_Trees","220616592_Disjoint_Rooted_Spanning_Trees_with_Small_Depths_in_deBruijn_and_Kautz_Graphs","220533621_Pancyclicity_of_Restricted_Hypercube-Like_Networks_under_the_Conditional_Fault_Model","220397812_Independent_Trees_in_Planar_Graphs_Independent_trees","220379349_Independent_spanning_trees_on_twisted_cubes","220359122_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Odd_Graphs","220339166_Multi-node_broadcasting_in_all-ported_3-D_wormhole-routed_torus_using_an_aggregation-then-distribution_strategy","220315077_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_twisted_cubes","220314376_Independent_spanning_trees_on_even_networks","220310652_Edge-pancyclicity_and_path-embeddability_of_bijective_connection_graphs","220224179_Embedding_of_Cycles_in_Twisted_Cubes_with_Edge-Pancyclic","220209086_Independent_spanning_trees_on_folded_hyper-stars","220155182_Constructing_independent_spanning_trees_for_locally_twisted_cubes","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","220115861_Multiply-Twisted_Hypercube_with_Five_or_More_Dimensions_is_not_Vertex-Transitive","220112312_Connectivity_of_the_Crossed_Cube","49763245_Formaldehyde_gas_sensing_chip_based_on_single-walled_carbon_nanotubes_and_thin_water_layer","32164419_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Chordal_Rings","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks","3301166_Optimal_Embeddings_of_Paths_with_Various_Lengths_in_Twisted_Cubes","3300330_Efficient_broadcasting_in_wormhole-routed_multicomputers_A_network-partitioning_approach","3043516_Embedding_binary_trees_into_crossed_cubes","3042877_A_Variation_on_the_hypercube_with_lower_diameter"]}
