{"id":"312186592_Favoriser_l'enseignement_de_l'algorithmique_en_mathematiques_une_question_de_distance_aux_mathematiques","abstract":"We are interested in the perception that mathematics teachers has of the introduction of algorithmic in the mathematics curricula at the high school in France: what are their representations of these new contents? Which difficulties do they declare they meet in implementing these programs? Our research reveals the existence of a tension in the interviews undertaken with mathematics teachers, reflecting the official instructions ambiguities, between two possible approaches of algorithmic: one turned towards mathematics, minimizing the technological context, the other one distant from mathematics, turned towards the data-processing programming. We make the assumption that the knowing this tension and taking into account this distance are significant components to be considered while building training sessions for the mathematics teachers in order to support the teaching of algorithmic in class of mathematics.","authors":["Mariam Haspekian","Claver Nijimbéré"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.4000/educationdidactique.2609"],"references":["309236936_Teachers_Practices_and_Professional_Geneses_with_ICT","294426354_INTEGRATION_D'OUTILS_INFORMATIQUES_DANS_L'ENSEIGNEMENT_DES_MATHEMATIQUES_ETUDE_DU_CAS_DES_TABLEURS","242748247_Algorithmique_et_apprentissage_de_la_preuve","226262115_Learning_Mathematics_in_a_CAS_Environment_The_Genesis_of_a_Reflection_about_Instrumentation_and_the_Dialectics_between_Technical_and_Conceptual_Work","36379340_Une_didactique_de_l'informatique","277118145_Etude_didactique_de_l'introduction_d'elements_d'algorithmique_et_de_programmation_dans_l'enseignement_mathematique_secondaire_a_l'aide_de_la_calculatrice","266685988_Algorithmic_Thinking_and_Mathematical_Thinking","225683960_Signification_et_fonctionnement_du_concept_de_variable_informatique_chez_des_eleves_debutants"]}
