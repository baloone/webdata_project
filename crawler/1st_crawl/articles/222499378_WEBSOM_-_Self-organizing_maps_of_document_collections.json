{"id":"222499378_WEBSOM_-_Self-organizing_maps_of_document_collections","abstract":"With the WEBSOM method a textual document collection may be organized onto a graphical map display that provides an overview of the collection and facilitates interactive browsing. Interesting documents can be located on the map using a content-directed search. Each document is encoded as a histogram of word categories which are formed by the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm based on the similarities in the contexts of the words. The encoded documents are organized on another self-organizing map, a document map, on which nearby locations contain similar documents. Special consideration is given to the computation of very large document maps which is possible with general-purpose computers if the dimensionality of the word category histograms is first reduced with a random mapping method and if computationally efficient algorithms are used in computing the SOMs.","authors":["Samuel Kaski","Timo Honkela","Krista Lagus","Teuvo Kohonen"],"meta":["November 1998Neurocomputing 21(1-3):101-117","DOI:10.1016/S0925-2312(98)00039-3","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["221299037_A_Self-Organizing_Semantic_Map_for_Information_Retrieval","3753708_Dimensionality_reduction_by_random_mapping_Fast_similarity_computation_for_clustering","3651964_Exploration_of_full-text_databases_with_self-organizing_maps","2794395_Creating_an_Order_in_Digital_Libraries_with_Self-Organizing_Maps","2791923_Content-Based_Document_Classification_With_Highly_Compressed_Input_Data","2733848_Self-Organizing_Maps_of_Document_Collections_A_New_Approach_to_Interactive_Exploration","2675347_Browsing_Digital_Libraries_with_the_Aid_of_Self-Organizing_Maps","2424530_Contextual_Relations_of_Words_in_Grimm_Tales_Analyzed_by_Self-Organizing_Map","2342815_Map_of_WSOM'97_Abstracts_-_Alternative_Index","2306447_Lessons_Learned_in_Text_Document_Classification","2257771_Newsgroup_Exploration_with_WEBSOM_Method_and_Browsing_Interface","2243270_Content-Based_Software_Classification_by_Self-Organization","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","291181909_Unsupervised_methods_for_finding_linguistic_categories","270819378_The_self-organizing_map","265919274_Self-organizing_maps_2nd_ed","262198555_WEBSOM_--_A_Status_Report","262198554_Self-Organizing_Maps_of_Very_Large_Document_Collections_Justification_for_the_WEBSOM_method","243763586_Automatic_methods_for_finding_linguistic_categories","243626833_Learning_semantotopic_maps_from_context","242608902_Selj-organization_o_software_libraries_an_artificial_neural_network_approach","238758021_Internet_Categorization_and_Search_A_Self-Organizing_Approach","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","226722882_Computationally_Efficient_Approximation_of_a_Probabilistic_Model_for_Document_Representation_in_the_WEBSOM_Full-Text_Analysis_Method","226434431_Self-organizing_semantic_maps","222029218_The_self-organizing_map","220693038_Subsymbolic_natural_language_processing_An_integrated_model_of_scripts_lexicon_and_memory","220688577_Introduction_To_Modern_Information_Retrieval","220637671_Neural_Navigation_Interfaces_for_Information_Retrieval_Are_They_More_than_an_Appealing_Idea","220466559_HNC's_MatchPlus_system","220433471_Map_Displays_for_Information_Retrieval","220017453_Using_Linear_Algebra_For_Intelligent_Information_Retrieval","45678860_A_spatial_user_interface_to_the_astronomical_literature","3769182_Structuring_software_for_reuse-the_case_of_self-organizing_maps","3705354_Exploration_of_very_large_databases_by_self-organizing_maps","3595689_Application_of_self-organizing_feature_maps_with_lateral_inhibition_to_structure_a_library_of_reusable_software_components","3529489_Unsupervised_learning_and_the_information_retrieval_problem","3513435_Visualization_for_the_document_space","2681039_Very_Large_Two-Level_SOM_for_the_Browsing_of_Newsgroups","2659405_Neural_Networks_and_Information_Extraction_in_Astronomical_Information_Retrieval","2260986_Text_Document_Classification_with_Self-Organizing_Maps"]}
