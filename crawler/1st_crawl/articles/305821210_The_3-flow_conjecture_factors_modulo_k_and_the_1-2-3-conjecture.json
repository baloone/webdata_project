Then, for each mapping , G has a subgraph H such that each vertex v has H-degree modulo k. We apply this to prove that, if is a proper vertex-coloring of a graph G of chromatic number or , then each edge of G can be assigned a weight 1 or 2 such that each weighted vertex-degree of G is congruent to c modulo k. Consequently, each nonbipartite -edge-connected graph of chromatic number at most k (where k is any odd natural number ≥3) has an edge-weighting with weights such that neighboring vertices have distinct weighted degrees (even after reducing these weighted degrees modulo k). We characterize completely the bipartite graph having an edge-weighting with weights such that neighboring vertices have distinct weighted degrees. In particular, that problem belongs to P while it is NP-complete for nonbipartite graphs. The characterization also implies that every 3-edge-connected bipartite graph with at least 3 vertices has such an edge-labeling, and so does every simple bipartite graph of minimum degree at least 3.","authors":["Carsten Thomassen","Yezhou Wu","Cun-quan Zhang"],"meta":["August 2016Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 121","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2016.06.010"],"references":["303470172_Inhibition_of_Macrophage_Migration_Inhibitory_Factor_Protects_against_Inflammation_and_Matrix_Deposition_in_Kidney_Tissues_after_Injury","220200458_Vertex-colouring_edge-weightings_with_two_edge_weights","220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","306190316_The_factors_of_graphs_Can","259994274_Graph_factors_modulo_k","259096420_Nowhere-zero_3-flows_and_modulo_k-orientations","251506498_The_weak_3-flow_conjecture_and_the_weak_circular_flow_conjecture","247153065_Vertex-Coloring_Edge-Weighting_of_Bipartite_Graphs_with_Two_Edge_Weights","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","225795841_Edge-decompositions_of_highly_connected_graphs_into_paths","225540132_The_Erdos-Posa_Property_for_Odd_Cycles_in_Graphs_of_Large_Connectivity","222679264_Vertex-Coloring_2-Edge-Weighting_of_Graphs","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220549086_Claw-decompositions_and_Tutte-orientations","220441404_Vertex-Colouring_Edge-Weightings","220200541_On_the_complexity_of_vertex-coloring_edge-weightings","220074779_Vertex_coloring_edge_partitions"]}
