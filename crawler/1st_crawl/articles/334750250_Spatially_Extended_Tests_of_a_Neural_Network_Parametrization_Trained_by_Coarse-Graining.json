{"id":"334750250_Spatially_Extended_Tests_of_a_Neural_Network_Parametrization_Trained_by_Coarse-Graining","abstract":"Abstract General circulation models (GCMs) typically have a grid size of 25–200 km. Parametrizations are used to represent diabatic processes such as radiative transfer and cloud microphysics and account for subgrid‐scale motions and variability. Unlike traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) can readily exploit recent observational data sets and global cloud‐system resolving model (CRM) simulations to learn subgrid variability. This article describes an NN parametrization trained by coarse‐graining a near‐global CRM simulation with a 4‐km horizontal grid spacing. The NN predicts the residual heating and moistening averaged over (160 km)2 grid boxes as a function of the coarse‐resolution fields within the same atmospheric column. This NN is coupled to the dynamical core of a GCM with the same 160‐km resolution. A recent study described how to train such an NN to be stable when coupled to specified time‐evolving advective forcings in a single‐column model, but feedbacks between NN and GCM components cause spatially extended simulations to crash within a few days. Analyzing the linearized response of such an NN reveals that it learns to exploit a strong synchrony between precipitation and the atmospheric state above 10 km. Removing these variables from the NN's inputs stabilizes the coupled simulations, which predict the future state more accurately than a coarse‐resolution simulation without any parametrizations of subgrid‐scale variability, although the mean state slowly drifts.","authors":["Noah D.
