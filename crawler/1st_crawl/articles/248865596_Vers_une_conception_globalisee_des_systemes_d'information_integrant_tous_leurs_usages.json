This article attempts to shed some light through the contrasting views of two researchers from the two disciplines involved. Starting with some innovative elements concerning the communication and approach to information systems the authors reflect upon the various present and potential uses of CIS in organizations. The article goes on to describe new applications (Blog, Wiki, RSS...) allowing the development of a creative variety which is lacking in present information systems. This analysis concludes with the suggestion of a world concept of CIS allowing us to integrate secure structured fields but also more informal zones which generate a greater possibility for people to express themselves and to adapt to new situations.","authors":["Noy Claire","Jacques Ruiz"],"meta":["February 2007La Revue des Sciences de Gestion Direction et Gestion 223(223):87-97","DOI:10.1051/larsg:2007008"],"references":[]}
