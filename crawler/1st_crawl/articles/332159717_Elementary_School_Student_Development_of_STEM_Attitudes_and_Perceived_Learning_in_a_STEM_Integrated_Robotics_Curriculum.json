{"id":"332159717_Elementary_School_Student_Development_of_STEM_Attitudes_and_Perceived_Learning_in_a_STEM_Integrated_Robotics_Curriculum","abstract":"Robotics has been advocated as an emerging approach to engaging K-12 students in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study examined the impacts of a project-based STEM integrated robotics curriculum on elementary school students’ attitudes toward STEM and perceived learning in an afterschool setting. Three elementary school teachers and 18 fourth to sixth graders participated in an eight-week-long program. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed, and showed students’ attitudes toward math improved significantly at the end of the robotics curriculum. Three specific areas of perceived learning were identified, including STEM content learning and connection, engagement and perseverance, and development and challenge in teamwork. The findings also identified the opportunities and challenges in designing a STEM integrated robotics afterschool curriculum for upper elementary school students. Implications for future research studies and curriculum design are discussed.","authors":["Yu-Hui Ching","Dazhi Yang","Sasha Wang","Youngkyun Baek"],"meta":["April 2019TechTrends 63(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-019-00388-0"],"references":["320637894_Implementing_a_Robotics_Curriculum_in_an_Early_Childhood_Montessori_Classroom","303806832_Using_Robotics_and_Game_Design_to_Enhance_Children's_Self-Efficacy_STEM_Attitudes_and_Computational_Thinking_Skills","293328901_Constructionist_Gaming_Understanding_the_Benefits_of_Making_Games_for_Learning","281345525_Motivational_Beliefs_Values_and_Goals","277651432_Teaching_Robotics_at_the_Primary_School_An_Innovative_Approach","262310824_Using_Robotics_to_Motivate_'Back_Door'_Learning","262143204_Design_and_development_issues_for_educational_robotics_training_camps","254639116_Considerations_for_Teaching_Integrated_STEM_Education","235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology","234725693_Acquisition_of_Physics_Content_Knowledge_and_Scientific_Inquiry_Skills_in_a_Robotics_Summer_Camp","227151040_What_pupils_can_learn_from_working_with_robotic_direct_manipulation_environments","32231247_Cognitive_Technologies_for_Mathematics_Education","7352709_Math_and_Science_Motivation_A_Longitudinal_Examination_of_the_Links_Between_Choices_and_Beliefs","327170840_Why_are_we_learning_this_Using_mixed_methods_to_understand_teachers'_relevance_statements_and_how_they_shape_middle_school_students'_perceptions_of_science_utility","324843220_Developing_Computational_Thinking_with_Educational_Technologies_for_Young_Learners","323372050_Student_Perceptions_of_a_Summer_Robotics_Camp_Experience","318155236_Developing_an_Integrative_STEM_Curriculum_for_Robotics_Education_Through_Educational_Design_Research","311663204_Student_Perceptions_of_a_Summer_Ventures_in_Science_and_Mathematics_Camp_Experience_STEM_Perceptions","297056469_Educational_robotics_as_a_learning_tool_for_promoting_rich_environments_for_active_learning_REALs","287738099_Learning_approaches_to_applying_robotics_in_science_education","283172966_Evaluating_the_impact_of_educational_robotics_on_pupils'_technical-_and_social-skills_and_science_related_attitudes","281390875_Teachers'_perceptions_of_the_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_integrating_educational_robots_into_primaryelementary_curricula","273835648_Measuring_Choice_to_Participate_in_Optional_Science_Learning_Experiences_During_Early_Adolescence","273458545_Implementation_and_integration_of_engineering_in_K-12_STEM_education","272416866_The_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Measure_of_Student_Attitudes_Toward_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Math_S-STEM","271992251_Impact_of_Robotics_and_Geospatial_Technology_Interventions_on_Youth_STEM_Learning_and_Attitudes","259514433_Computational_thinking_and_tinkering_Exploration_of_an_early_childhood_robotics_curriculum","239563835_Application_of_Case_Study_Research","233820393_Social_Foundations_of_Thought_Action_A_Social_Cognitive_Theory","230557894_Case_Study_Research","230202999_Pipeline_Persistence_Examining_the_Association_of_Educational_Experiences_With_Earned_Degrees_in_STEM_Among_US_Students","222554690_Expectancy-Value_Theory_of_Achievement_Motivation","220140191_Exploring_the_educational_potential_of_robotics_in_schools_A_systematic_review","31849692_Applications_of_Case_Study_Research_RK_Yin"]}
