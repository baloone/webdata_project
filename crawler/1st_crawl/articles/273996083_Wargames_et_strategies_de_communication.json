{"id":"273996083_Wargames_et_strategies_de_communication","abstract":"Wargames are a kind of games used notably by professionals to simulate and prepare business strategies. Their use goes back to the eighteenth century at least, when the armies have adapted a war game to train officers to take command. Nowadays, they are used in economic intelligence with the name of business wargames. They are a particular and coordinated adaptation of a role playing games and maps to solve a strategic problem. If their usefulness as a tool to help for reasoning or the strategic anticipation has been studied, we observed that works about their uses and communicational practices were strewn. Thus, we have wanted to gather in this paper a set of information and experiences related to the issue of potentialities and communicational risks of wargames whether in military contexts, economic or historical.","authors":["St√©phane Goria"],"meta":["December 2012Communication & Organisation","DOI:10.4000/communicationorganisation.3903","Project: Jeux et acquisition d'information"],"references":["281356291_Les_utilites_du_jeu_video_serieux_finalites_discours_et_mises_en_correlation","254191296_Ex_ante_strategy_evaluation_The_case_for_business_wargaming","30453738_Questions_sur_la_neutralite_des_outils_de_type_jeux_de_role_et_cartographie_participative_dans_une_experience_de_gouvernance_fonciere_au_Senegal","26883425_First-Person_Shooter_Games_as_a_Way_of_Connecting_to_People_Brothers_in_Blood","324435643_Le_game_design_de_jeux_videos_une_approche_communicationnelle_et_interculturelle","228802717_Business_wargaming_simulations_guide_crucial_strategy_decisions","227447760_The_Role_of_Management_Games_in_Education_and_Research","222652966_Constructing_futures_A_social_constructionist_perspective_on_foresight_methodology","46955442_The_Power_of_Maps"]}
