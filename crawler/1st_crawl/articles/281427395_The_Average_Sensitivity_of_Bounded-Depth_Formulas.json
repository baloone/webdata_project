{"id":"281427395_The_Average_Sensitivity_of_Bounded-Depth_Formulas","abstract":"We show that unbounded fan-in boolean formulas of depth $d+1$ and size $s$\nhave average sensitivity $O(\\frac{1}{d}\\log s)^d$. In particular, this gives a\ntight $2^{\\Omega(d(n^{1/d}-1))}$ lower bound on the size of depth $d+1$\nformulas computing the \\textsc{parity} function. These results strengthen the\ncorresponding $2^{\\Omega(n^{1/d})}$ and $O(\\log s)^d$ bounds for circuits due\nto H{\\aa}stad (1986) and Boppana (1997). Our proof technique studies a random\nprocess where the Switching Lemma is applied to formulas in an efficient\nmanner.","authors":["Benjamin Rossman"],"meta":["June 2018computational complexity 27(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-017-0156-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259044488_Formulas_vs_Circuits_for_Small_Distance_Connectivity","245730978_Complexity_of_the_realization_of_a_linear_function_in_the_case_of-circuits","242807208_-Formulae_on_Finite_Structures","242356818_Z_formulae_on_finite_structures","238737028_On_time-hardware_complexity_tradeoffs_for_Boolean_functions","227216931_Complexity_of_the_realization_of_a_linear_function_in_the_class_of_II-circuits","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","222610119_The_average_sensitivity_of_bounded-depth_circuits","51960974_The_Quantum_Query_Complexity_of_Read-Many_Formulas","4355018_Separating_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy_by_oracles","2631399_Almost_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Small_Depth_Circuits"]}
