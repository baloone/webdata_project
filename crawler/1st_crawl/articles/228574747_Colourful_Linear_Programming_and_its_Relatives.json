{"id":"228574747_Colourful_Linear_Programming_and_its_Relatives","abstract":"We consider the following Colourful generalization of Linear Programming: given sets of points S, ... , Sk C Rd, referred to as colours, and a point b E Rd, decide whether there is a colourful T = {s ..., Sk such that b E conv(T), and if there is one, find it. Linear Programming is obtained by taking k = d + 1 and S = = Sd,+. + If k = d + 1 and b E nf I+ conv(S) then a solution always exists: we describe an efficient iterative approximation algorithm for this problem, that finds a colourful T whose convex hull contains a point e-close to b, and analyze its real arithmetic and Turing time complexities. In contrast, we show that Colourful Linear Programming is strongly AT-complete. We consider a class of linear algebraic relatives of Colourful Linear Programming, and give a computational complexity classification of the related decision and counting problems that arise. We also introduce and discuss the complexity of a hierarchy of (w,, w2)-Matroid-Basis-Nonbasis problems, and give an application of Colourful Linear Programming to the algorithmic problems of Tverberg's theorem in combinatorial geometry.","authors":["Imre Bárány","Shmuel Onn"],"meta":["September 1997Mathematics of Operations Research 22(3)","DOI:10.1287/moor.22.3.550"],"references":["244954707_A_Generalization_of_Radon's_Theorem","210304600_On_a_Theory_of_Computation_and_Complexity_over_the_Real_Numbers_NP-Completeness_Recursive_Functions_and_Universal_Machines","265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","249701278_Piercing_convex_sets_and_the_Hadwiger-Debrunner_-problem","244956494_A_generalization_of_Radon's_theorem_II","244956300_A_generalization_of_Carath_eodory''s_theorem","242501875_On_a_theory_of_computation_and_complexity_over_the_real_numbers_np-completeness","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming","226173315_Tverberg's_theorem_via_number_fields","225444867_Improved_bounds_on_weak_-nets_for_convex_sets","224945038_Personal_Communication","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","220453228_Signable_Posets_and_Partitionable_Simplicial_Complexes","2509645_On_the_Geometry_and_Computational_Complexity_of_Radon_Partitions_in_the_Integer_Lattice"]}
