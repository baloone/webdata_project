{"id":"275279783_On_the_Lov'asz_Theta_function_for_Independent_Sets_in_Sparse_Graphs","abstract":"We consider the maximum independent set problem on graphs with maximum degree d. We show that the integrality gap of the Lovasz Theta function-based SDP has an integrality gap of O~(d/log3/2 d). This improves on the previous best result of O~(d/log d), and narrows the gap of this basic SDP to the integrality gap of O~(d/log² d) recently shown for stronger SDPs, namely those obtained using poly log(d) levels of the SA+ semidefinite hierarchy. The improvement comes from an improved Ramsey-theoretic bound on the independence number of Kr-free graphs for large values of r.\nWe also show how to obtain an algorithmic version of the above-mentioned SAplus-based integrality gap result, via a coloring algorithm of Johansson. The resulting approximation guarantee of O~(d/log² d) matches the best unique-games-based hardness result up to lower-order poly (log log d) factors.","authors":["Nikhil Bansal","Anupam Gupta","Guru Guruganesh"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1145/2746539.2746607","SourcearXiv"],"references":["242913993_Approximating_the_independence_number_via_the_-function","226956676_On_Turan's_theorem_for_sparse_graphs","220673327_Improved_Approximations_of_Independent_Sets_in_Bounded-Degree_Graphs_via_Subgraph_Removal","220358127_A_General_Upper_Bound_on_the_List_Chromatic_Number_of_Locally_Sparse_Graphs","3083181_On_the_Shannon_capcity_of_a_graph","2618856_Approximations_of_Weighted_Independent_Set_and_Hereditary_Subset_Problems","2521821_A_Comparison_of_the_Sherali-Adams_Lovasz-Schrijver_and_Lasserre_Relaxations_for_0-1_Programming","1961276_Approximate_Graph_Coloring_by_Semidefinite_Programming","321514881_Algorithms_and_Combinatorics","301466233_Separation_between_Estimation_and_Approximation","282312000_Approximating_independent_sets_in_sparse_graphs","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","267123912_Approximation_Algorithms_and_Semidefinite_Programming","266659428_Distributed_algorithms_for_the_Lovasz_Local_Lemma_and_graph_coloring","262170383_Approximation_resistance_from_pairwise_independent_subgroups","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","244507082_The_choice_number_of_sparse_graphs","244462698_Graph_Colouring_and_the_Probabilistic_Method","244418327_Asymptotic_choice_number_for_triangle_free_graphs","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","228903659_Convex_Relaxations_and_Integrality_Gaps","222801325_A_note_on_Ramsey_numbers","222472913_Coloring_Graphs_with_Sparse_Neighborhoods","222159459_A_note_on_the_independence_number_of_triangle-free_graphs","221580624_Inapproximability_of_Vertex_Cover_and_Independent_Set_in_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","220898247_Better_Inapproximability_Results_for_MaxClique_Chromatic_Number_and_Min-3Lin-Deletion","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220617850_Set_Partitioning_via_Inclusion-Exclusion","220533300_Approximating_Maximum_Clique_by_Removing_Subgraphs","220431158_Dependent_rounding_and_its_applications_to_approximation_algorithms","220406982_Fast_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Brooks-Vizing_Colorings","220357749_On_Brooks'_Theorem_for_Sparse_Graphs","220345657_Independence_numbers_of_locally_sparse_graphs_and_a_Ramsey_type_problem","220345287_On_the_Independence_Number_of_Sparse_Graphs","216877580_Geometric_Algorithms_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","51941179_Concentration_and_Moment_Inequalities_for_Polynomials_of_IndependentRandom_Variables","3593086_Approximate_Graph_Coloring_by_Semidefinite_Programming","2388029_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Vertex_Cover_Problem_in_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","1784794_Coloring_Simple_Hypergraphs"]}
