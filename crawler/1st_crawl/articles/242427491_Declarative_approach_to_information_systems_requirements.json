{"id":"242427491_Declarative_approach_to_information_systems_requirements","abstract":"The specification of requirements is among the most critical activities of information system development, and yet it is very prone to errors. A number of actions are proposed here to improve the situation: (1) shifting the concern from the target system towards its environment; (2) using an expressive language close to the natural way future users of the system express their requirements; and (3) using a formal language to ensure unambiguity, and to provide the deductive capabilities that will help in validating the requirements. A requirements expression language called ERAE is presented, which is inspired by some of the knowledge representation techniques in artificial intelligence, and by the so-called ‘declarative’ conceptual modelling languages in databases. The author also illustrates how the accompanying methodology makes the best use of the language's characteristics.","authors":["Jacques Hagelstein"],"meta":["September 1988Knowledge-Based Systems 1(4)","DOI:10.1016/0950-7051(88)90031-7"],"references":["2997616_A_knowledge_representation_language_for_requirements_engineering","285011736_A_process_model_for_requirements_engineering","262295932_Active_and_passive_component_modelling_ACMPCM","247867809_The_Entity-Association_Model_Towards_a_Unified_View_of_Data","238727588_On_concepts_and_strategies_for_requirements_and_information_analysis","223291836_A_Requirements_Modeling_Language_and_Its_Logic","221395849_Principles_of_good_software_specification_and_their_implications_for_specification_languages","221329700_Information_Modeling_in_the_Context_of_System_Development","221309334_The_ERAE_model_a_case_study","220965972_A_Data_Model_for_Requirements_Analysis","220225407_Database_Description_with_SDM_A_Semantic_Database_Model","220225384_Database_abstractions_aggregation_and_generalization","3189503_An_Operational_Approach_To_Requirements_Specification_For_Embedded_Systems","2960280_Knowledge_Representation_as_the_Basis_for_Requirements_Specifications","2960239_A_Taxonomy_of_Current_Issues_in_Requirements_Engineering"]}
