{"id":"314283206_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Sentence_Embeddings_using_Compositional_n-Gram_Features","abstract":"The recent tremendous success of unsupervised word embeddings in a multitude of applications raises the obvious question if similar methods could be derived to improve embeddings (i.e. semantic representations) of word sequences as well. We present a simple but efficient unsupervised objective to train distributed representations of sentences. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised models on most benchmark tasks, and on many tasks even beats supervised models, highlighting the robustness of the produced sentence embeddings.","authors":["Matteo Pagliardini","Prakhar Gupta","Martin Jaggi"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["318084717_SemEval-2017_Task_1_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_-_Multilingual_and_Cross-lingual_Focused_Evaluation","306093724_Siamese_CBOW_Optimizing_Word_Embeddings_for_Sentence_Representations","305334586_Learning_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_from_Unlabelled_Data","329977655_A_Latent_Variable_Model_Approach_to_PMI-based_Word_Embeddings","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","319770220_Bag_of_Tricks_for_Efficient_Text_Classification","318741395_Bag_of_Tricks_for_Efficient_Text_Classification","305388986_Enriching_Word_Vectors_with_Subword_Information","304037295_Improving_Distributional_Similarity_with_Lessons_Learned_from_Word_Embeddings","303921530_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Word-Sequence_Representations_from_Scratch_via_Convolutional_Tensor_Decomposition"]}
