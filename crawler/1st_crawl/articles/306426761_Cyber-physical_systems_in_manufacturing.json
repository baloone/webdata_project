{"id":"306426761_Cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","abstract":"One of the most significant advances in the development of computer science, information and communication technologies is represented by the cyber-physical systems (CPS). They are systems of collaborating computational entities which are in intensive connection with the surrounding physical world and its on-going processes, providing and using, at the same time, data-accessing and data-processing services available on the Internet. Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), relying on the latest, and the foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th industrial revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4.0. The paper underlines that there are significant roots in general – and in particular to the CIRP community – which point towards CPPS. Expectations towards research in and implementation of CPS and CPPS are outlined and some case studies are introduced. Related new R&D challenges are highlighted.","authors":["Laszlo Monostori","Botond Kádár","Thomas Bauernhansl","Shinsuke Kondoh"],"meta":["August 2016CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology 65(2):621–641","DOI:10.1016/j.cirp.2016.06.005"],"references":["318775505_Cyber_Manufacturing_Research_and_Applications","309345839_Complementary_Research_and_Education_Opportunities-A_Comparison_of_Learning_Factory_Facilities_and_Methodologies_at_TU_Wien_and_MTA_SZTAKI","349874275_Modular_Configuration_of_an_RFID-based_Hybrid_Control_Architecture_for_a_Situational_Shop_Floor_Control","321831647_Strukturstudie_INDUSTRIE_40_FUR_BADEN-WURTTEMBERG","316835161_Smarter_statt_schneller_Was_bringen_intelligente_Werkzeuge","306219443_Sustainable_increase_of_overhead_productivity_due_to_cyber-physicalsystems","306204452_Auf_dem_Weg_zur_selbstuberwachenden_Werkzeugmaschinen","306204446_Industrial_automation_services_as_part_of_the_Cloud_First_experiences","306202113_Intelligent_Manufacturing_Systems-_A_Tentative_Forecast","306202041_Sensoren_fur_die_digitale_Produktion","306200031_Synthesis_and_Emergence_Proceedings_of_International_Workshop_on_Emergent_Syn","306199839_Cyber-physical_production_management","306199608_Modelling_and_analysis_of_autonomously_controlled_production_networks","306199378_Cyberphysical_system_for_self-organised_and_flexible_labour_utilisation","306154353_Begrifflichkeiten_um_Industrie_40_Ordnung_im_Sprachwirrwarr"]}
