{"id":"352191445_Complementary_methods_for_SARS-CoV-2_diagnosis_in_times_of_material_shortage","abstract":"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 resulted in increasing demands for diagnostic tests, leading to a shortage of recommended testing materials and reagents. This study reports on the performance of self-sampled alternative swabbing material (ordinary Q-tips tested against flocked swab and rayon swab), of reagents for classical RNA extraction (phenol/guanidine-based protocol against a commercial kit), and of intercalating dye-based one-step quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCRs (RT-qPCR) compared against the gold standard hydrolysis probe-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The study found sampling with Q-tips, RNA extraction with classical protocol and intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR as a reliable and comparably sensitive strategy for detection of SARS-CoV-2â€”particularly valuable in the current period with a resurgent and dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections and growing shortage of diagnostic materials especially for regions limited in resources.","authors":["Thaisa Lucas Sandri","Juliana Inoue","Johanna Geiger","Johanna-Marie Griesbaum"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91457-z"],"references":["351510203_AACC_Guidance_Document_on_Laboratory_Investigation_of_Acute_Kidney_Injury","343646651_Contact_Settings_and_Risk_for_Transmission_in_3410_Close_Contacts_of_Patients_With_COVID-19_in_Guangzhou_China_A_Prospective_Cohort_Study","343512566_Lower_cost_alternatives_for_molecular_diagnosis_of_COVID-19_conventional_RT-PCR_and_SYBR_Green-based_RT-qPCR","343143367_Comparison_of_Unsupervised_Home_Self-collected_Midnasal_Swabs_With_Clinician-Collected_Nasopharyngeal_Swabs_for_Detection_of_SARS-CoV-2_Infection","340591428_Long-term_predictions_for_COVID-19_pandemic_dynamics_in_Ukraine_Austria_and_Italy","340265448_Report_from_the_American_Society_for_Microbiology_COVID-19_International_Summit_23_March_2020_Value_of_Diagnostic_Testing_for_SARS-CoV-2COVID-19","338788554_Detection_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_by_real-time_RT-PCR","349609101_The_Effects_of_Dry_Swab_Incubation_on_SARS-CoV-2_Molecular_Testing","340616852_Diagnostic_Testing_for_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome-Related_Coronavirus-2_A_Narrative_Review","340294095_Prediction_of_the_time_evolution_of_the_Covid-19_Pandemic_in_Italy_by_a_Gauss_Error_Function_and_Monte_Carlo_simulations"]}
