{"id":"321302981_Survey_of_Four_Uncertainty_Quantifications_Methods_in_Systems_Engineering","abstract":"Uncertainty is an inherent property of engineering systems. Many methods for quantifying uncertainty have been proposed and applied to systems engineering. In this paper, we survey some of the literature on uncertainty quantification and comment on some criticisms of various approaches. We specifically focus on four selected methods: Monte Carlo simulation, cross entropy methods, fuzzy theory, and evidence theory. Â© Springer International Publishing AG 2018.
