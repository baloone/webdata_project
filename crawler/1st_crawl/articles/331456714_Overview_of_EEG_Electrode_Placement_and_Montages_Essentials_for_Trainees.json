{"id":"331456714_Overview_of_EEG_Electrode_Placement_and_Montages_Essentials_for_Trainees","abstract":"Brain works with electricity. EEG records the electrical activity of the neurons in the brain. The international 10â€“20 system is used for electrode placement. A bipolar montage method of electrode placement localizes abnormal brain discharges as phase reversal, while in a referential montage the amplitude of the waveforms localize epileptiform abnormalities. This chapter describes the EEG leads application methods, montages as well as filter and amplifier settings in a simple and easy to understand way.","authors":["Mona Sazgar","Michael G.
