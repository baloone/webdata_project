{"id":"2827537_On_Piecewise_Testable_Starfree_and_Recognizable_Picture_Languages","abstract":"We isolate a technique for showing that a picture language (i.e. aâ€œtwo-dimensional language/rd) is not recognizable. Then we prove the non-recognizability of a picture language that is both starfree (i.e., definable by means of union, concatenation, and complement) and piecewise testable (i.e., definable by means of allowed subpictures), solving an open question in [GR96].\nWe also define local, locally testable, and locally threshold testable picture languages and summarize known inclusion results for these classes. The classes of piecewise testable, locally testable, and locally threshold testable picture languages can, as in the word case, be characterized by certain (fragments of) first-order logics.","authors":["Oliver Matz"],"meta":["March 1999Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/BFb0053551"],"references":["2813073_Regular_Expressions_and_Context-Free_Grammars_for_Picture_Languages","222841414_Shallit_J_A_lower_bound_technique_for_the_size_of_nondeterministic_finite_automata_Inform_Process_Lett_59_75-77","220994328_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic_Over_Pictures_and_Recognizability_by_Tiling_Systems","220115100_The_State_Complexity_of_Sigma_L_and_its_Connection_with_Temporal_Logic","3707370_Monadic_quantifier_alternation_hierarchy_over_graphs_is_infinite","2818549_Star-free_Picture_Expressions_are_Strictly_Weaker_than_First-Order_Logic","2422930_Two-Dimensional_Languages"]}
