{"id":"283043651_The_complexity_of_signed_graph_and_edge-coloured_graph_homomorphisms","abstract":"The goal of this work is to study homomorphism problems (from a computational\npoint of view) on two superclasses of graphs: $2$-edge-coloured graphs and\nsigned graphs. On the one hand, we consider the $H$-COLOURING problem when $H$\nis a $2$-edge-coloured graph, and we show that a dichotomy theorem would imply\nthe dichotomy conjecture of Feder and Vardi. On the other hand, we prove a\ndichotomy theorem for the $(H,\\Pi)$-COLOURING problem for a large class of\nsigned graphs $(H,\\Pi)$. Specifically, as long as $(H,\\Pi)$ does not contain a\nnegative (respectively a positive) loop, the problem is polynomial-time\nsolvable if the core of $(H,\\Pi)$ has at most two edges and is NP-complete\notherwise. (Note that this covers all simple signed graphs.) The same dichotomy\nholds if $(H,\\Pi)$ has no digons, and we conjecture that it holds always.","authors":["Richard C.
