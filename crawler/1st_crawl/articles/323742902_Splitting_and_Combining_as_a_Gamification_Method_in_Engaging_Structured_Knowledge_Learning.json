{"id":"323742902_Splitting_and_Combining_as_a_Gamification_Method_in_Engaging_Structured_Knowledge_Learning","abstract":"The understanding of the structure of knowledge is an essential step of education. Although teachers offer the information foundation and relationship among knowledge points, there are still few methods to encourage students to explore the structure of knowledge by themselves outside of classes. This paper explores the gamification method and the knowledge structure of computer science. We assess the gamification method of “splitting and combining” (SC) to encourage students to finish the process of learning structured knowledge in the university. The results show that this method works well in promoting learning enjoyment and that splitting demonstrates better performance than combining. We can consider the SC method when recommending a gamification method to engage students in structural learning assistance in future smart university education.","authors":["Donglei Song","Daqian Shi","Rusi Wang","Hao Xu"],"meta":["March 2018Sustainability 10(3):800","DOI:10.3390/su10030800"],"references":["286716753_The_Bloomsbury_Companion_to_Heidegger","272095154_Study_Designs_in_Medicine","264860703_Case_Studies_and_the_Flipped_Classroom","262312974_Gamification_at_Work_Designing_Engaging_Business_Software","317254853_An_Enjoyable_Learning_Experience_in_Personalising_Learning_Based_on_Knowledge_Management_A_Case_Study","317027867_Theory_of_knowledge_Structures_and_processes","300588016_Gamification_of_Education_A_Review_of_Literature","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","268426233_Building_Blocks_for_Mobile_Games_A_Multiplayer_Framework_for_App_Inventor_for_Android","262358663_The_effect_of_virtual_achievements_on_student_engagement"]}
