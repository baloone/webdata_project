{"id":"267678051_From_Time_to_Space_Fast_Algorithms_That_Yield_Small_and_Fast_Data_Structures","abstract":"In many cases, the relation between encoding space and execution time translates into combinatorial lower bounds on the computational complexity of algorithms in the comparison or external memory models. We describe a few cases which illustrate this relation in a distinct direction, where fast algorithms inspire compressed encodings or data structures. In particular, we describe the relation between searching in an ordered array and encoding integers; merging sets and encoding a sequence of symbols; and sorting and compressing permutations.","authors":["Jérémy Félix Barbay"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40273-9_8","Project: Adaptive Analysis of Algorithms"],"references":["220994280_Compressed_Representations_of_Permutations_and_Applications","220779801_RankSelect_Operations_on_Large_Alphabets_a_Tool_for_Text_Indexing","220779709_Fully-Functional_Succinct_Trees","220390389_Succinct_indexes_for_strings_binary_relations_and_multilabeled_trees","46588172_LRM-Trees_Compressed_Indices_Adaptive_Sorting_and_Compressed_Permutations","45886582_Efficient_Fully-Compressed_Sequence_Representations","45849945_Fully-Functional_Static_and_Dynamic_Succinct_Trees","2567898_High-Order_Entropy-Compressed_Text_Indexes","1888921_Succinct_Indexable_Dictionaries_with_Applications_to_Encoding_k-aryTrees_Prefix_Sums_and_Multisets","268372587_Upper_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Text_Indexing_Data_Structures","256720267_Sorting_trees_and_measures_of_order","242909903_Sorting_unsorted_and_partially_sorted_lists_using_the_natural_merge_sort","225541963_Two_Probabilistic_Results_on_Merging","225533292_Sorting_shuffled_monotone_sequences","225246528_Binary_Interpolative_Coding_for_Effective_Index_Compression","225195440_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Rank_and_Select_Indexes","224578655_Merge_Source_Coding","223253320_A_framework_for_adaptive_sorting","221590107_Scaling_and_Related_Techniques_for_Geometry_Problems","221543940_Deterministic_Algorithm_for_the_t-Threshold_Set_Problem","221314130_A_Fast_Set_Intersection_Algorithm_for_Sorted_Sequences","220780448_Adaptive_set_intersections_unions_and_differences","220618277_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Merging_Two_Disjoint_Linearly_Ordered_Sets","220535872_An_Overview_of_Adaptive_Sorting","220329243_Measures_of_Presortedness_and_Optimal_Sorting_Algorithms","220246349_Sorting_Shuffled_Monotone_Sequences","220224453_Sublinear_Merging_and_Natural_Mergesort","220111547_An_Almost_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Unbounded_Searching","200034178_Sorting_and_Searching_in_Multisets","51930271_Succinct_Representations_of_Permutations_and_Functions","23647393_Optimal_Succinctness_for_Range_Minimum_Queries","4696426_Adaptive_Variable-Length_Coding_for_Efficient_Compression_of_Spacecraft_Television_Data","3880913_Lower_bounds_on_the_efficiency_of_generic_cryptographic_constructions","3501857_Space-efficient_Static_Trees_and_Graphs","3082524_Universal_Codeword_Sets_and_Representations_of_the_Integers","2301118_A_Survey_of_Adaptive_Sorting_Algorithms"]}
