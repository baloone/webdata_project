{"id":"309383969_Hub_network_design_problems_with_profits","abstract":"This paper presents a class of hub network design problems with profit-oriented objectives, which extend several families of classical hub location problems. Potential applications arise in the design of air and ground transportation networks. These problems include decisions on the origin/destination nodes that will be served as well as the activation of different types of edges, and consider the simultaneous optimization of the collected profit, setup cost of the hub network and transportation cost. Alternative models and integer programming formulations are proposed and analyzed. Results from computational experiments show the complexity of such models and highlight their superiority for decision-making.","authors":["Armaghan Alibeyg","Ivan Contreras","Elena Fernandez"],"meta":["December 2016Transportation Research Part E Logistics and Transportation Review 96","DOI:10.1016/j.tre.2016.09.008"],"references":["289586258_Exact_and_heuristic_approaches_for_the_cycle_hub_location_problem","279585374_Hub-and-spoke_networks_in_air_transportation_An_analytical_review","269805332_Twenty-Five_Years_of_Hub_Location_Research","268982774_Hub_Location_Problems_with_Price_Sensitive_Demands","255353181_Traveling_Salesman_Problems_With_Profits","248452426_The_Hub_Network_Design_Problem-A_Review_and_Synthesis","239283479_Networking_Policies_for_Hub-and-Spoke_Systems_with_Application_to_the_Air_Transportation_System","236509352_Twenty-Five_Years_of_Hub_Location_Research","229793327_Hub-and-Spoke_Networks_in_Air_Transportation_An_Analytical_Review","229713657_Hub_Networks_and_Simulated_Schedule_Delay","227447627_Hub_Arc_Location_Problems_Part_I---Introduction_and_Results","222135577_Integer_Programming_Formulations_of_Discrete_Hub_Location_Problem","23527549_Hub_Location_with_Flow_Economies_of_Scale","320338811_Exact_Solution_of_Hub_Network_Design_Problems_with_Profits","306146168_Hub_location_problems_A_review_of_models_classification_solution_techniques_and_applications","283030508_Hub_Location_Problems","280743478_The_Maximal_Covering_Location_Problem","276889990_The_Hub_Line_Location_Problem","276486371_Exact_and_Heuristic_Algorithms_for_the_Design_of_Hub_Networks_with_Multiple_Lines","271601349_Multi-period_hub_location_problems_in_transportation","270635496_Hub_Location_as_the_Minimization_of_a_Supermodular_Set_Function","263389813_Fuel_Burn_and_Environmental_Implications_of_Airline_Hub_Networks","263173534_The_hub_covering_flow_problem","260367723_A_Stackelberg_hub_arc_location_model_for_a_competitive_environment","257424736_Network_design_approach_for_hub_ports-shipping_companies_competition_and_cooperation","257196505_Exact_approaches_for_solving_robust_prize-collecting_Steiner_tree_problems","257196235_General_Network_Design_A_Unified_View_of_Combined_Location_and_Network_Design_Problems","257177841_Uncapacitated_single_allocation_p-hub_maximal_covering_problem","256089758_Modeling_the_airline_hub_location_and_optimal_market_problems_with_continuous_approximation_techniques","251566399_A_competitive_hub_location_and_pricing_problem","245473041_Airline_Network_Design_and_Hub_Location_Problems","237011257_Modeling_Economies_of_Scale_in_Transportation_Hub_Networks","229397850_Selective_multi-depot_vehicle_routing_problem_with_pricing","227427325_Liner_shipping_hub_network_design_in_a_competitive_environment","223407062_Benders_decomposition_for_the_uncapacitated_multiple_allocation_hub_location_problem","222691572_Adapting_polyhedral_properties_from_facility_to_hub_location_problems","222676989_Hub-and-Spoke_Network_Alliances_and_Mergers_Price-Location_Competition_in_the_Airline_Industry","222675577_A_Conditional_P-Hub_Location_Problem_with_Attraction_Functions","222626897_Network_Hub_Location_Problems_The_State_of_the_Art","220470602_On_the_Selection_of_Hub_Airports_for_an_Airline_Hub-and-Spoke_System","220208950_Solving_the_hub_location_problem_in_a_star-star_network","46495391_The_competition_game_on_hub_network_design","46491946_The_Tree_of_Hubs_Location_Problem","37762102_Location_of_Hubs_in_a_Competitive_Environment","23984449_Solving_the_Prize-collecting_Rural_Postman_Problem","4939587_Competitive_facility_location_and_design_problem"]}
