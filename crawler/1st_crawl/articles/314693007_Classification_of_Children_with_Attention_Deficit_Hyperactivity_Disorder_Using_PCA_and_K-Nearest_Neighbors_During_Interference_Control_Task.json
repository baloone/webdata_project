{"id":"314693007_Classification_of_Children_with_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Using_PCA_and_K-Nearest_Neighbors_During_Interference_Control_Task","abstract":"This study investigates the EEG signals obtained from Children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing (TD) children while performing a hybrid Simonâ€“spatial Stroop task, which is aimed to achieve a high classification rate. First, a subset EEG channels were selected using principal component analysis (PCA) to preserve as much information as the full set of 128 channels. Second, the feature set consisted of the time-domain amplitude in all the segmentation time windows from 30 subjects with leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation strategy, which was collected from the optimal channels in prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal area during four different conditions. Then, K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify ADHD and TD. The results showed that the best classification accuracy of 83.33 % was achieved by K-NN classifier, suggesting that the method could detect ADHD effectively.","authors":["Jiaojiao Yang","Wenjie Li","Suhong Wang","Jieru Lu"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-0207-6_61","In book: Advances in Cognitive Neurodynamics (V) (pp.447-453)"],"references":["261315607_Detecting_ADHD_children_using_symbolic_dynamic_of_nonlinear_features_of_EEG","233995768_Using_non-linear_features_of_EEG_for_ADHDnormal_participants'_classification","224225828_Optimizing_the_Channel_Selection_and_Classification_Accuracy_in_EEG-Based_BCI","262278484_Analysis_of_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_and_Control_Participants_in_EEG_Using_ICA_and_PCA","262166926_Channel_selection_by_Rayleigh_coefficient_maximization_based_genetic_algorithm_for_classifying_single-trial_motor_imagery_EEG","260044482_Age_dependent_electroencephalographic_changes_in_Attention_DeficitHyperactivity_Disorder_ADHD","236691113_Interference_control_in_6-11_year-old_children_with_and_without_ADHD_Behavioral_and_ERP_Study","8487890_Common_and_distinct_neural_substrates_of_attentional_control_in_an_integrated_Simon_and_spatial_Stroop_Task_as_assessed_by_event-related_fMRI"]}
