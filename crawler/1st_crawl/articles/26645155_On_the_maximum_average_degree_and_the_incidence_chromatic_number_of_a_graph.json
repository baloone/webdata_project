It is known that the incidence chromatic number of every graph G with maximum average degree mad(G)<3 is at most Δ (G)+3. We show that when Δ (G) ≥ 5, this bound may be decreased to Δ (G)+2. Moreover, we show that for every graph G with mad(G)<22/9 (resp. with mad(G)<16/7 and Δ (G)≥ 4), this bound may be decreased to Δ (G)+2 (resp. to Δ (G)+1).","authors":["Mohammad Hosseini Dolama","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["December 2005Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 7(1)","DOI:10.46298/dmtcs.349"],"references":["220185407_Incidence_coloring_of_k-degenerated_graphs","2565260_On_the_Maximum_Average_Degree_and_the_Oriented_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","222769578_The_Star_Arboricity_of_Graphs","222499233_On_incidence_coloring_and_star_arboricity_of_graphs","220193152_On_incidence_coloring_for_some_cubic_graphs","220190429_The_incidence_coloring_conjecture_for_graphs_of_maximum_degree_3","220187764_The_incidence_coloring_number_of_Halin_graphs_and_outerplanar_graphs"]}
