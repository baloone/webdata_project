{"id":"3625964_The_role_of_experimentation_in_software_engineering_Past_current_and_future","abstract":"Software engineering needs to follow the model of other physical sciences and develop an experimental paradigm for the field. This paper proposes the approach towards developing an experimental component of such a paradigm. The approach is based upon a quality improvement paradigm that addresses the role of experimentation and process improvement in the content of industrial development. The paper outlines a classification scheme for characterizing such experiments","authors":["V.R.
