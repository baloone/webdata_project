{"id":"314948271_Structured_Peer_Learning_Program_-_An_Innovative_Approach_to_Computer_Science_Education","abstract":"Structured Peer Learning (SPL) is a form of peer-based supplemental instruction that focuses on mentoring, guidance, and development of technical, communication, and social skills in both the students receiving assistance and the students in teaching roles. This paper explores the methodology, efficacy, and reasoning behind the practical realization of a SPL program designed to increase student knowledge and success in undergraduate Computer Science courses. Students expressed an increased level of comfort when asking for help from student teachers versus traditional educational resources, historically showed an increased average grade in lower-level courses, and felt that the program positively impacted their desire to continue in or switch to a Computer major. Additionally, results indicated that advances in programming, analytical thinking, and abstract analysis skills were evident in not only the students but also the student teachers, suggesting a strong bidirectional flow of knowledge.","authors":["Teresa Leyk","Robert McInvale","Ling Chen"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["234792021_Programming_in_an_undergraduate_CS_curriculum","269981310_College_Peer_Groups_Problems_and_Prospects_for_Research","246671933_Learning_Together_Peer_Tutoring_in_Higher_Education","229801198_Enhancing_the_lecture_Revitalizing_a_traditional_format","226817678_Student_Peer_Teaching_An_Innovative_Approach_to_Instruction_in_Science_and_Engineering_Education","226669554_Peer_Teaching_in_Higher_Education_A_Review","220017715_Does_Active_Learning_Work_A_Review_of_the_Research","44821650_The_Effectiveness_of_Peer_Tutoring_in_Further_and_Higher_Education_A_Typology_and_Review_of_the_Literature","2607785_Computer_Science_The_Discipline"]}
