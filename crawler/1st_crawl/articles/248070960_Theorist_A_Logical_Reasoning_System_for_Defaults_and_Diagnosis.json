{"id":"248070960_Theorist_A_Logical_Reasoning_System_for_Defaults_and_Diagnosis","abstract":"We provide an introduction to Theorist, a logic programming system that uses a uniform deductive reasoning mechanism to construct explanations of observations in terms of facts and hypotheses. Observations, facts, and possible hypotheses are each sets of logical formulas that represent, respectively, a set of observations on a partial domain, a set of facts for which the domain is a model, and a set of tentative hypotheses which may be required to provide a consistent explanation of the observations.\nTheorist has been designed to reason in a fashion similar to how we reason with and construct scientific theories. Rather than monotonically deduce theorems from a fixed logical theory, theorist distinguishes facts from hypotheses and attempts to use deduction to construct consistent theories for which the observations are logical consequences. A prototype, implemented in Prolog, demonstrates how diagnosis, default reasoning, and a kind of learning can all be based on the Theorist framework.","authors":["David Poole","Randy Goebel","Romas Aleliunas"],"meta":["January 1987","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4612-4792-0_13"],"references":[]}
