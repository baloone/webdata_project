{"id":"352142086_Ensuring_the_Correctness_of_Regular_Expressions_A_Review","abstract":"Regular expressions are widely used within and even outside of computer science due to their expressiveness and flexibility. However, regular expressions have a quite compact and rather tolerant syntax that makes them hard to understand, hard to compose, and error-prone. Faulty regular expressions may cause failures of the applications that use them. Therefore, ensuring the correctness of regular expressions is a vital prerequisite for their use in practical applications. The importance and necessity of ensuring correct definitions of regular expressions have attracted extensive attention from researchers and practitioners, especially in recent years. In this study, we provide a review of the recent works for ensuring the correct usage of regular expressions. We classify those works into different categories, including the empirical study, test string generation, automatic synthesis and learning, static checking and verification, visual representation and explanation, and repairing. For each category, we review the main results, compare different approaches, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss some potential future research directions.","authors":["Li-Xiao Zheng","Shuai Ma","Zu-Xi Chen","Xiangyu Luo"],"meta":["June 2021International Journal of Automation and Computing 18(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11633-021-1301-4"],"references":["336447233_Automatic_repair_of_regular_expressions","348827835_FlashRegex_deducing_anti-ReDoS_regexes_from_examples","347306293_An_Empirical_Study_on_Regular_Expression_Bugs","346784287_Fast_Learning_of_Restricted_Regular_Expressions_and_DTDs","345506840_String_Generation_for_Testing_Regular_Expressions","345473132_A_Lightweight_Framework_for_Regular_Expression_Verification","342180651_Multi-modal_synthesis_of_regular_expressions","338512035_Regexes_are_Hard_Decision-Making_Difficulties_and_Risks_in_Programming_Regular_Expressions","338507045_Testing_Regex_Generalizability_And_Its_Implications_A_Large-Scale_Many-Language_Measurement_Study","336340361_Regular_Expression_Learning_with_Evolutionary_Testing_and_Repair","335495288_Exploring_Tools_and_Strategies_Used_During_Regular_Expression_Composition_Tasks","335084180_Why_aren't_regular_expressions_a_lingua_franca_an_empirical_study_on_the_re-use_and_portability_of_regular_expressions","334115503_SemRegex_A_Semantics-Based_Approach_for_Generating_Regular_Expressions_from_Natural_Language_Specifications","331872251_Exploring_Regular_Expression_Evolution","328903388_Research_Paper_Automatic_Checking_of_Regular_Expressions"]}
