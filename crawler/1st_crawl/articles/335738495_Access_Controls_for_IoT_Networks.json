{"id":"335738495_Access_Controls_for_IoT_Networks","abstract":"The message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol is becoming the main protocol for the internet of things (IoT). In this paper, we define a highly expressive attribute-based access control (ABAC) security model for the MQTT protocol. Our model allows us to regulate not only publications and subscriptions, but also distribution of messages to subscribers. We can express various types of contextual security rules (temporal security rules, content-based security rules, rules based on the frequency of events, etc.).","authors":["Alban Gabillon","Romane Gallier","Emmanuel Bruno"],"meta":["September 2019SN Computer Science 1(1)","DOI:10.1007/s42979-019-0022-z"],"references":["319596994_Dynamic_Policies_in_Internet_of_Things_Enforcement_and_Synchronization","318707529_Security_towards_the_Edge_Sticky_Policy_Enforcement_for_Networked_Smart_Objects","317936413_OAuth-IoT_An_access_control_framework_for_the_Internet_of_Things_based_on_open_standards","317645466_P4SINC_-_An_Execution_Policy_Framework_for_IoT_Services_in_the_Edge","333429553_ECC_based_inter-device_authentication_and_authorization_scheme_using_MQTT_for_IoT_networks","328535320_A_Security_Model_for_IoT_Networks_5th_International_Conference_FDSE_2018_Ho_Chi_Minh_City_Vietnam_November_28-30_2018_Proceedings","327453486_Regulating_IoT_Messages_14th_International_Conference_ISPEC_2018_Tokyo_Japan_September_25-27_2018_Proceedings","324543121_Access_Control_in_the_Era_of_Big_Data_State_of_the_Art_and_Research_Directions","324543119_Access_Control_Enforcement_within_MQTT-based_Internet_of_Things_Ecosystems","319393716_OWL_2_Web_Ontology_Language_Document_Overview","315857122_Attribute-Based_Access_Control_Scheme_in_Federated_IoT_Platforms","303816152_AUPS_An_Open_Source_AUthenticated_PublishSubscribe_system_for_the_Internet_of_Things","302615228_Dynamic_access_control_in_a_content-based_publishsubscribe_system_with_delivery_guarantees","290882468_iCore_A_Cognitive_Management_Framework_for_the_Internet_of_Things","277287914_SWI-Prolog_29_-_Reference_Manual"]}
