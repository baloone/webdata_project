{"id":"342990931_Cities_and_countries_in_the_global_scientist_mobility_network","abstract":"Abstract Global mobility and migration of scientists is an important modern phenomenon with economic and political implications. As scientists become ever more footloose it is important to identify general patterns and regularities at a global scale and how it impacts a countryâ€™s scientific output. The analysis of mobility and brain circulation patterns at global scale remains challenging, due to difficulties in obtaining individual level mobility data. In this work we trace intercity and international mobility through bibliographic records. We reconstruct the intercity and international mobility network of 3.7 million life scientists moving between 5 thousand cities and 189 Countries. In this exploratory analysis we offer evidence that international scientist mobility is marked by national borders and show that international mobility boosts the scientific output of selected countries.","authors":["Luca Verginer","Massimo Riccaboni"],"meta":["July 2020Applied Network Science 5(1)","DOI:10.1007/s41109-020-00276-0"],"references":["327886798_Multiscale_impact_of_researcher_mobility","323502497_Science_of_science","284689712_The_War_for_Talent","324776982_International_research_networks_Determinants_of_country_embeddedness","322780598_Cross-country_Perspectives_on_Migration_and_Development_INTRODUCTION","317108299_People_on_the_move_The_science_of_migrations","317075079_Introducing_ORCID","317074690_A_mobility_boost_for_research","316328454_Context_Factors_and_the_Performance_of_Mobile_Individuals_in_Research_Teams","292442579_The_International_Mobility_of_Talent_Types_Causes_and_Development_Impact"]}
