{"id":"283757813_Planar_graphs_with_D_8_are_D_1-edge-choosable","abstract":"We consider the problem of list edge coloring for planar graphs. Edge coloring is the problem of coloring the edges while ensuring that two edges that are incident receive different colors. A graph is k-edge-choosable if for any assignment of k colors to every edge, there is an edge coloring such that the color of every edge belongs to its color assignment. Vizing conjectured in 1965 that every graph is (Δ+1)-edge-choosable. In 1990, Borodin solved the conjecture for planar graphs with maximum degree Δ ≥ 9 and asked whether the bound could be lowered to 8. We prove here that planar graphs with Δ ≥ 8 are (Δ + 1)-edge-choosable.","authors":["Marthe Bonamy"],"meta":["January 2015SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 29(3):1735-1763","DOI:10.1137/130927449"],"references":["258817413_Planar_graphs_with_maximum_degree_D_at_least_8_are_D1-edge-choosable","256694183_Colorings_of_plane_graphs_A_survey","227965771_Graphs_of_degree_4_are_5-edge-choosable","223112124_Planar_graphs_with_maximum_degree_D9_are_D1-edge-choosable-A_short_proof","220317423_Choosability_and_edge-choosability_of_planar_graphs_without_5-cycles","220191270_Structural_properties_and_edge_choosability_of_planar_graphs_without_4-cycles","220190131_Edge_choosability_of_planar_graphs_without_small_cycles","220078851_List_Edge_and_List_Total_Colourings_of_Multigraphs","220076935_Planar_Graphs_of_Maximum_Degree_Seven_are_Class_I","2819104_Graphs_of_Degree_4_Are_5-Edge-Choosable"]}
