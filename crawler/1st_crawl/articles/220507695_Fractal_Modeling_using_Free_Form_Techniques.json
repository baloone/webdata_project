{"id":"220507695_Fractal_Modeling_using_Free_Form_Techniques","abstract":"IFS models have become a powerful tool for the construction of fractal sets. They offer a straightforward way to generate complex, self-similar figures as attractors. However, they present the fundamental disadvantage of providing little control over the global form of the attractor. In contrast, free form techniques give a high control over smooth man-made objects with the use of a set of control points.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach of fractal modeling which is based on IFS theory. We shall use free form techniques to give a practical and efficient way to build controlled fractal attractors. The resulting effect consists on the ability to deform a fractal shape interactively into the desired shape, in the same way as parametric forms (BÃ©zier, splines).","authors":["Chems Eddine Zair","Eric Tosan"],"meta":["August 1996Computer Graphics Forum 15(3):269-278","DOI:10.1111/1467-8659.1530269","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242608845_Rendering_methods_for_iterated_function_systems","242505713_Iterated_Function_Systems_and_the_Global_Construction_of_Fractals","224377499_A_Theoretical_Development_for_the_Computer_Generation_of_Piecewise_Polynomial_Surfaces","222879272_Computing_curves_invariant_under_halving","220251376_Modeling_and_rendering_of_nonlinear_iterated_function_systems","220221083_Computing_surfaces_invariant_under_subdivision","220184385_Markov_Chains_and_Computer_Aided_Geometric_Design_II_-_Examples_and_Subdivision_Matrices","220183951_Markov_Chains_and_Computer-Aided_Geometric_Design_Part_I_-_Problems_and_Constraints"]}
