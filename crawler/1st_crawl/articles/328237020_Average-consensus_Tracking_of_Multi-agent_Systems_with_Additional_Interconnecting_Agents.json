{"id":"328237020_Average-consensus_Tracking_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_Additional_Interconnecting_Agents","abstract":"Average-consensus tracking problem is investigated for first-order multi-agent systems composed of valid agents and additional interconnecting agents. Valid agents have constant reference inputs, while additional interconnecting agents do not have reference inputs. Average-consensus tracking algorithms are proposed for the agents converging to the average value of constant reference inputs of valid agents. Under symmetric and connected topology, consensus conditions are obtained for the agents without and with communication delay, respectively, by using generalized Nyquist criterion. Numerical examples illustrate the correctness of theoretical results.","authors":["Liang Shan","Cheng-Lin Liu"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of the Franklin Institute 355(17)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.10.007","Project: Robot-assisted pedestrian flow control of a controlled pedestrian corridor"],"references":["264386295_Continuous-time_average_consensus_under_dynamically_changing_topologies_and_multiple_time-varying_delays","320666428_Containment_Control_of_Heterogeneous_Fractional-Order_Multi-Agent_Systems","318334565_Robust_dynamic_average_consensus_algorithm_for_signals_with_bounded_derivatives","312890364_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","286512969_Consensus_of_Hybrid_Multi-Agent_Systems","276549031_Average_Consensus_Over_High-Order_Multiagent_Systems","276542848_Average_consensus_on_strongly_connected_weighted_digraphs_A_generalized_error_bound","271419547_Scalable_robustness_for_consensus_protocols_with_heterogeneous_dynamics","267213803_Distributed_Average_Tracking_for_Reference_Signals_With_Bounded_Accelerations"]}
