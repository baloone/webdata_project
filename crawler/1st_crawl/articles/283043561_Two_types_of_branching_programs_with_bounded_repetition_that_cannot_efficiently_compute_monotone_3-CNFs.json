{"id":"283043561_Two_types_of_branching_programs_with_bounded_repetition_that_cannot_efficiently_compute_monotone_3-CNFs","abstract":"We prove exponential lower bounds for two classes of non-deterministic\nbranching programs (NBPs) with bounded repetition computing a class of\nfunctions representable by monotone 3-CNFs. The first class significantly\ngeneralizes monotone read-$k$-times NBPs and the second class generalizes\noblivious read $k$ times branching programs. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first separation of monotone NBPs with bounded repetition from monotone\nCNFs as well as the first separation of oblivious read-$k$-times branching\nprograms (even determinisitc ones) from CNFs. The lower bounds remain\nexponential for $k \\leq \\log n/a$ where $a$ is a sufficiently large constant.","authors":["Igor Razgon"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["282844196_On_Oblivious_Branching_Programs_with_Bounded_Repetition_that_Cannot_Efficiently_Compute_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","303787226_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","267812027_On_the_Read-Once_Property_of_Branching_Programs_and_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","263619967_No_Small_Nondeterministic_Read-Once_Branching_Programs_for_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","255971731_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","220574979_Meanders_and_Their_Applications_in_Lower_Bounds_Arguments","38383836_Interpolation_Theorems_Lower_Bounds_for_Proof_Systems_and_Independence_Results_for_Bounded_Arithmetic","2501038_A_Non-linear_Time_Lower_Bound_for_Boolean_Branching_Programs","2309643_Lower_Bounds_for_Deterministic_and_Nondeterministic_Branching_Programs"]}
