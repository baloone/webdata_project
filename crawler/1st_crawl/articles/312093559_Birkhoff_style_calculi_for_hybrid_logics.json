{"id":"312093559_Birkhoff_style_calculi_for_hybrid_logics","abstract":"We develop an abstract proof calculus for hybrid logics whose sentences are (hybrid) Horn clauses, and we prove a Birkhoff completeness theorem for hybrid logics in the general setting provided by the institution theory. This result is then applied to particular cases of hybrid logics with user-defined sharing, where the first-order variables in quantified sentences are interpreted uniformly across worlds.","authors":["Daniel Găină"],"meta":["January 2017Formal Aspects of Computing","DOI:10.1007/s00165-016-0414-y","Project: Mathematical structures for developing reconfigurable software systems"],"references":["316529434_Foundations_of_logic_programming_in_hybrid_logics_with_user-defined_sharing","292461721_Foundations_of_Logic_Programming_in_Hybridised_Logics","276384653_Downward_Lowenheim-Skolem_Theorem_and_interpolation_in_logics_with_constructors","274151032_Quasi-varieties_and_initial_semantics_for_hybridized_institutions","319393842_General_Logics","301846899_Implicit_Kripke_Semantics_and_Ultraproducts_in_Stratified_Institutions","298329599_Proof_theory_for_hybridised_logics","280721389_Encoding_hybridized_institutions_into_first-order_logic","269723210_Refinement_in_hybridised_institutions","267976766_13_questions_about_universal_logic_13_questions_to_Jean-Yves_Beziau_by_Linda_Eastwood"]}
