{"id":"282514254_Efficient_Noise_Reduction_Method_Based_on_Multilinear_Tools_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","abstract":"In the hyperspectral images (HSI) acquired by the new-generation hyperspectral sensors the signal dependent noise is an important limitation to the detection or classification. Therefore, noise reduction is an important preprocessing step to analyze the information in the hyperspectral image (HSI). A signal dependent noise cannot be reduced by conventional linear filtering. Therefore, a new method based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) decomposition is proposed to estimate the noise of hyperspectral remote sensing image. Then, the estimated noise is used for whitening the colored structural noise. By using this transformation, the data noise from new-generation hyperspectral sensors is diminished, thereby allowing a minimization of negative impacts on hyperspectral detection and classification applications.","authors":["Josselin Juan","Caroline Fossati","Salah Bourennane"],"meta":["May 2015Journal of Remote Sensing Technology","DOI:10.18005/JRST0302002"],"references":["258656438_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_Employing_a_Spectral-Spatial_Adaptive_Total_Variation_Model","304425264_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","284686548_The_PARAFAC_model_for_three-way_factor_analysis_and_multidimensional_scaling_in_Research_Methods_for_Multimode_Data_Analysis_ed_by_Law_HG_Snyder_CW_Jr_Hattie_JA_and_McDonald_RP_Praeger","260604007_Reduction_of_Signal-Dependent_Noise_From_Hyperspectral_Images_for_Target_Detection","258792903_Multiple-Spectral-Band_CRFs_for_Denoising_Junk_Bands_of_Hyperspectral_Imagery","257405089_Analysis_of_classification_accuracy_for_pre-filtered_multichannel_remote_sensing_data","254063233_Nonwhite_Noise_Reduction_in_Hyperspectral_Images","253531979_Reliably_estimating_the_noise_in_AVIRIS_hyperspectral_images","248977058_Principal_Components_transform_with_simple_automatic_noise_adjustment","228995742_Noise_estimation_in_remote_sensing_imagery_using_data_masking"]}
