{"id":"328652435_Formalization_Techniques_for_Asymptotic_Reasoning_in_Classical_Analysis","abstract":"Formalizing analysis on a computer involves a lot of \"epsilon-delta\" reasoning, while informal reasoning may use some asymptotic hand-waving. Whether or not the arithmetic details are hidden using some abstraction like filters, a human user eventually has to break it down for the proof assistant anyway, and provide a witness for the existential variable \"delta\". We describe formalization techniques that take advantage of existential variables to delay the input of witnesses until a stage where the proof assistant can actually infer them. We use these techniques to prove theorems about classical analysis and to provide equational Bachmann-Landau notations. This partially restores the simplicity of informal hand-waving without compromising the proof. As expected this also reduces the size of proof scripts and the time to write them, and it also makes proofs more stable.","authors":["Reynald Affeldt","Cyril Cohen","Damien Rouhling"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Formalized Reasoning 11(1)","DOI:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/8124"],"references":["319203540_A_Formal_Proof_in_Coq_of_LaSalle's_Invariance_Principle","303955695_Proving_Divide_and_Conquer_Complexities_in_IsabelleHOL","268325896_Formalization_of_O_Notation_in_IsabelleHOL","262332132_Type_Classes_and_Filters_for_Mathematical_Analysis_in_IsabelleHOL","262177836_Canonical_Structures_for_the_Working_Coq_User","271573415_Coquelicot_A_User-Friendly_Library_of_Real_Analysis_for_Coq","265577838_Cours_de_mathematiques-3_Complements_d'analyse_Classes_preparatoires_1er_cycles_universitaire","258456211_Formalized_algebraic_numbers_construction_and_first-order_theory","239724138_Axiom_of_Choice_and_Complementation","51962965_Wave_Equation_Numerical_Resolution_A_Comprehensive_Mechanized_Proof_of_a_C_Program"]}
