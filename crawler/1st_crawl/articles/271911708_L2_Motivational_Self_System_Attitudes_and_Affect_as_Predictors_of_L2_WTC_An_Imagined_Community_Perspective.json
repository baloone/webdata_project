{"id":"271911708_L2_Motivational_Self_System_Attitudes_and_Affect_as_Predictors_of_L2_WTC_An_Imagined_Community_Perspective","abstract":"This study explored the interrelationships between the three components of second language (L2) motivational self system (i.e., ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self, and L2 learning experience), international posture, L2 anxiety, and willingness to communicate (WTC) using structural equation modeling. Questionnaire data were collected from 1,013 university students in China. The results showed that ideal L2 self was predicted by learning experience, ought-to L2 self, and international posture. Ideal L2 self and ought-to L2 self exerted, respectively, a negative and positive effect on L2 anxiety. L2 WTC was found to encompass two distinct factors: WTC inside and outside the classroom. The former was predicted by L2 anxiety, learning experience, and international posture, whereas the latter had international posture as its only direct predictor. This model marks the first step toward drawing on L2 motivational self system to account for foreign language learnersâ€™ communication intention from the perspective of an imagined global community.","authors":["Jian-E Peng"],"meta":["June 2014The Asia-Pacific Education Researcher
