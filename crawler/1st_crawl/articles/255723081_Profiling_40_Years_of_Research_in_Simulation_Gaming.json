{"id":"255723081_Profiling_40_Years_of_Research_in_Simulation_Gaming","abstract":"The authors apply the research profiling method to review all the research that has been published in Simulation & Gaming since the journal’s inauguration in 1970. The data include 2,096 articles, of which 1,046 are research articles. The authors identify the prolific authors and their institutional affiliations. They tally referenced articles, title phrases, and descriptors. They find that the most prolific authors neither engage in more work division nor author more conventional thinking articles than less prolific authors and that the 51 prolific authors fall into 7 to 11 clusters.","authors":["Johanna Bragge","Precha Thavikulwat","Juuso Töyli"],"meta":["December 2010Simulation & Gaming 41(6):869-897","DOI:10.1177/1046878110387539"],"references":["263455394_Research_profiling_Improving_the_literature_review","247740398_Developments_in_Business_Gaming_A_Review_of_the_Past_40_Years","236031787_Statistical_Bibliography_or_Bibliometrics","297908482_The_intellectual_development_of_management_information_systems_1972-1982_a_co-citation_analysis_vol_32_pg_156_1986","285341095_Generating_and_Presenting_Innovation_Indicators","251874270_Understanding_the_Role_and_Methods_of_Meta-Analysis_in_IS_Research","247740384_Evolving","243787854_Visualising_science_through_citation_mapping","239822774_Mapping_the_Intellectual_Structure_of_MIS_1980-1985_A_Co-Citation_Analysis","235242534_Response_to_Comment_on_Clustering_by_Passing_Messages_Between_Data_Points"]}
