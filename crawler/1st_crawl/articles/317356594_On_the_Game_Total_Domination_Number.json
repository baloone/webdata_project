{"id":"317356594_On_the_Game_Total_Domination_Number","abstract":"The total domination game is a two-person competitive optimization game, where the players, Dominator and Staller, alternately select vertices of an isolate-free graph $G$. Each vertex chosen must strictly increase the number of vertices totally dominated. This process eventually produces a total dominating set of $G$. Dominator wishes to minimize the number of vertices chosen in the game, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The game total domination number of $G$, $\\gamma_{{\\rm tg}}(G)$, is the number of vertices chosen when Dominator starts the game and both players play optimally. Recently, Henning, Klav\\v{z}ar, and Rall proved that $\\gamma_{{\\rm tg}}(G) \\le \\frac{4}{5}n$ holds for every graph $G$ which is given on $n$ vertices such that every component of it is of order at least $3$; they also conjectured that the sharp upper bound would be $\\frac{3}{4}n$. Here, we prove that $\\gamma_{{\\rm tg}}(G)\\le \\frac{11}{14}n$ holds for every $G$ which contains no isolated vertices or isolated edges.","authors":["Csilla Bujt√°s"],"meta":["May 2018Graphs and Combinatorics 34(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-018-1883-y"],"references":["309410061_Transversal_game_on_hypergraphs_and_the_34-conjecture_on_the_total_domination_game","301274687_Game_total_domination_for_cycles_and_paths","291437578_Bounds_on_the_Game_Transversal_Number_in_Hypergraphs","285575603_Total_Version_of_the_Domination_Game","263545410_On_the_Game_Domination_Number_of_Graphs_with_Given_Minimum_Degree","261439505_Domination_game_on_forests","250917606_Domination_game_Effect_of_edge-_and_vertex-removal","301312391_The_45_upper_bound_on_the_game_total_domination_number","286513259_Progress_Towards_the_Total_Domination_Game_frac34-Conjecture","264919524_Extremal_Problems_for_Game_Domination_Number"]}
