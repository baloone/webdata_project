{"id":"277333990_A_Novel_Normalized_Sign_Algorithm_for_System_Identification_Under_Impulsive_Noise_Interference","abstract":"To overcome the problem that the performance of adaptive filtering algorithm\ndegrades in the presence of impulsive noise, a novel normalized sign algorithm\n(NSA) based on the convex combination strategy is proposed in this paper, which\nis an adaptive combination of two NSA filters with the different step sizes,\ncalled NSA-NSA. The proposed approach is capable of solving the conflicting\nrequirement of fast convergence rate and low steady-state error for the single\nNSA filter. To further improve the robustness for impulsive noise, a mixing\nparameter updating formula based on a sign cost function is derived. Moreover,\na tracking weight transfer scheme of coefficients from a fast NSA filter to a\nslow NSA filter is presented for speed up convergence rate. Finally, the\nproposed algorithm is verified by theoretical analysis and simulation studies.","authors":["Lu Lu","Haiquan Zhao"],"meta":["September 2016Circuits Systems and Signal Processing 35(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00034-015-0195-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261091324_A_low-complexity_strategy_for_speeding_up_the_convergence_of_convex_combinations_of_adaptive_filters","260025394_LMSF_algorithm","220578016_Towards_the_Optimal_Learning_Rate_for_Backpropagation","289452949_Variable_Step_Size_Normalized_Sign_Algorithm_for_fast_convergent_adaptive_filters_with_robustness_against_impulse_noise","281133417_A_novel_convex_combination_of_LMS_adaptive_filter_for_system_identification","260615377_Variable_Step-Size_Affine_Projection_Sign_Algorithm","224733790_Dual_Sign_Algorithm_for_Adaptive_Filtering","224150424_A_variable_step-size_normalized_sign_algorithm_for_acoustic_echo_cancelation","224098609_An_Affine_Projection_Sign_Algorithm_Robust_Against_Impulsive_Interferences","221933062_Fundamentals_of_Adaptive_Filtering","3618479_Convergence_analysis_of_sign-sign_LMS_algorithm_for_adaptive_filters_with_correlated_Gaussian_data","31307353_Convergence_Analysis_of_Adaptive_Filters_Using_Normalized_Sign-Sign_Algorithm","4015694_An_adaptive_step-size_code-constrained_minimum_output_energy_receiver_for_nonstationary_CDMA_channels","4015414_A_normalized_mixed-norm_adaptive_filtering_algorithm_robust_under_impulsive_noise_interference","3643475_Analysis_and_implementation_of_the_max-NLMS_adaptive_filter"]}
