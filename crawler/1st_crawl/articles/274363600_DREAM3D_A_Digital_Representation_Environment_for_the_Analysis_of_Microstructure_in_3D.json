{"id":"274363600_DREAM3D_A_Digital_Representation_Environment_for_the_Analysis_of_Microstructure_in_3D","abstract":"This paper presents a software environment for processing, segmenting, quantifying, representing and manipulating digital microstructure data. The paper discusses the approach to building a generalized representation strategy for digital microstructures and the barriers encountered when trying to integrate a set of existing software tools to create an expandable codebase.","authors":["Michael A Groeber","Michael A Jackson"],"meta":["February 2014Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation 3(1):5","DOI:10.1186/2193-9772-3-5"],"references":["230827051_ImgLib2_-_Generic_Image_Processing_in_Java","267901251_Materials_Genome_Initiative_for_Global_Competitiveness","267354894_Integrated_Computational_Materials_Engineering_A_Transformational_Discipline_for_Improved_Competitiveness_and_National_Security","248495823_3D_Reconstruction_and_Characterization_of_Polycrystalline_Microstructures_Using_a_FIB-SEM_System","222669993_A_framework_for_automated_analysis_and_simulation_of_3D_polycrystalline_micro_structures_Part_2_Synthetic_structure_generation","222539268_A_framework_for_automated_analysis_and_simulation_of_3D_polycrystalline_microstructures_Part_1_Statistical_characterization"]}
