{"id":"249335443_Formation_of_cartels_in_glove_markets_and_the_modiclus","abstract":"We discuss market games or linear production games with a large but finite set of agents. The representing distributions of initial assignments are assumed to be uniform distributions with disjoint carriers. Thus, the agents decompose into finitely many disjoint groups where each holds a corner of the market. Following a paper of Hart we argue that the formation of cartels should be explained endogenously. Accordingly, we exhibit a solution concept that not only predicts cartelization but also explains the profits of the long side by its preventive power. This concept is the modified nucleolus or modiclus.","authors":["Peter Sudhölter","Joachim Rosenm�ller"],"meta":["January 2002Journal of Economics 73(3):217–246"],"references":[]}
