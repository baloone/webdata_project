{"id":"259893563_A_Constraint_Solving_Approach_to_Model_Reduction_by_Tropical_Equilibration","abstract":"Model reduction is a central topic in systems biology and dynamical systems theory, for reducing the complexity of detailed models, finding important parameters, and developing multi-scale models for instance. While singular perturbation theory is a standard mathematical tool to analyze the different time scales of a dynamical system and decompose the system accordingly, tropical methods provide a simple algebraic framework to perform these analyses systematically in polynomial systems. The crux of these methods is in the computation of tropical equilibrations. In this paper we show that constraint-based methods, using reified constraints for expressing the equilibration conditions, make it possible to numerically solve non-linear tropical equilibration problems, out of reach of standard computation methods. We illustrate this approach first with the detailed reduction of a simple biochemical mechanism, the Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction model, and second, with large-scale performance figures obtained on the http://biomodels.net\nrepository.","authors":["Sylvain Soliman","Fran√ßois Fages","Ovidiu Radulescu"],"meta":["January 2014Algorithms for Molecular Biology 9(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13015-014-0024-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260135944_The_QSSA_in_Chemical_Kinetics_As_Taught_and_as_Practiced","256088241_Complexity_of_solving_tropical_linear_systems","236935758_Tropicalization_and_tropical_equilibration_of_chemical_reactions","344485022_Algebraic_Curves","291205156_Max-plus_algebra_and_system_theory_where_we_are_and_where_to_go_now","265365356_Algebraic_curves_Unabridged_and_corrected_republication","260064596_Solving_Systems_of_Polynomial_Equations","256088335_Tropicalization_and_tropical_equilibration_of_chemical_reactions","247824022_The_CSP_method_for_simplifying_chemical_kinetics","243763400_SWI-Prolog_Reference_Manual"]}
