{"id":"303901466_New_Deterministic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Fully_Dynamic_Matching","abstract":"We present two deterministic dynamic algorithms for the maximum matching problem. (1) An algorithm that maintains a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching in general graphs with $O(\\text{poly}(\\log n, 1/\\epsilon))$ update time. (2) An algorithm that maintains an $\\alpha_K$ approximation of the {\\em value} of the maximum matching with $O(n^{2/K})$ update time in bipartite graphs, for every sufficiently large constant positive integer $K$. Here, $1\\leq \\alpha_K < 2$ is a constant determined by the value of $K$. Result (1) is the first deterministic algorithm that can maintain an $o(\\log n)$-approximate maximum matching with polylogarithmic update time, improving the seminal result of Onak et al. [STOC 2010]. Its approximation guarantee almost matches the guarantee of the best {\\em randomized} polylogarithmic update time algorithm [Baswana et al. FOCS 2011]. Result (2) achieves a better-than-two approximation with {\\em arbitrarily small polynomial} update time on bipartite graphs. Previously the best update time for this problem was $O(m^{1/4})$ [Bernstein et al. ICALP 2015], where $m$ is the current number of edges in the graph.","authors":["Sayan Bhattacharya","Monika Henzinger","Danupon Nanongkai"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1145/2897518.2897568","Conference: the 48th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["301268186_Faster_Fully_Dynamic_Matchings_with_Small_Approximation_Ratios","289156563_Improved_streaming_algorithms_for_weighted_matching_via_unweighted_matching","279310645_Fully_Dynamic_Matching_in_Bipartite_Graphs","273513632_Fully_Dynamic_Maximal_Matching_in_Olog_n_Update_Time","50292009_Fully_Dynamic_Maximal_Matching_in_O_log_n_Update_Time","301268317_Dynamic_1_-Approximate_Matchings_A_Density-Sensitive_Approach","301268096_Higher_Lower_Bounds_from_the_3SUM_Conjecture","284579459_Unifying_and_Strengthening_Hardness_for_Dynamic_Problems_via_the_Online_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_Conjecture","269116826_Deterministic_Fully_Dynamic_Data_Structures_for_Vertex_Cover_and_Matching","261056395_Fully_Dynamic_1_e-Approximate_Matchings","260022136_Popular_Conjectures_Imply_Strong_Lower_Bounds_for_Dynamic_Problems","242530345_On_an_estimate_of_the_chromatic_class_of_a_p-graph_In_Russian","239338292_The_chromatic_class_of_a_multigraph_in_Russian","228325437_Simple_Deterministic_Algorithms_for_Fully_Dynamic_Maximal_Matching","222006240_An_improved_maximal_matching_parallel_algorithm","221591836_Towards_polynomial_lower_bounds_for_dynamic_problems","221590842_Maintaining_a_Large_Matching_and_a_Small_Vertex_Cover","220780096_Faster_dynamic_matchings_and_vertex_connectivity","51960654_Maximum_Matching_in_Semi-Streaming_with_Few_Passes"]}
