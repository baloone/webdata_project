{"id":"322262515_Multiscale_modeling_of_a_low_magnetostrictive_Fe-27wtCo-05wtCr_alloy","abstract":"The present paper deals with the improvement of a multi-scale approach describing the magneto-mechanical coupling of Fe-27wt%Co-0.5wt%Cr alloy. The magnetostriction behavior is demonstrated as very different (low magnetostriction vs. high magnetostriction) when this material is submitted to two different final annealing conditions after cold rolling. The numerical data obtained from a multi-scale approach are in accordance with experimental data corresponding to the high magnetostriction level material. A bi-domain structure hypothesis is employed to explain the low magnetostriction behavior, in accordance with the effect of an applied tensile stress. A modification of the multiscale approach is proposed to match this result.","authors":["Maxime Savary","Olivier Hubert","Anne-Laure Helbert","T.
