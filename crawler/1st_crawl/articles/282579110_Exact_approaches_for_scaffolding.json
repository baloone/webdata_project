{"id":"282579110_Exact_approaches_for_scaffolding","abstract":"This paper presents new structural and algorithmic results around the scaffolding problem, which occurs prominently in next generation sequencing. The problem can be formalized as an optimization problem on a special graph, the \"scaffold graph\". We prove that the problem is polynomial if this graph is a tree by providing a dynamic programming algorithm for this case. This algorithm serves as a basis to deduce an exact algorithm for general graphs using a tree decomposition of the input. We explore other structural parameters, proving a linear-size problem kernel with respect to the size of a feedback-edge set on a restricted version of Scaffolding. Finally, we examine some parameters of scaffold graphs, which are based on real-world genomes, revealing that the feedback edge set is significantly smaller than the input size.","authors":["Mathias Weller","Annie Chateau","Rodolphe Giroudeau"],"meta":["October 2015BMC Bioinformatics 16(Suppl 14):S2","DOI:10.1186/1471-2105-16-S14-S2"],"references":["282601868_An_Integer_Linear_Programming_Approach_for_Genome_Scaffolding","269188058_Extensive_Error_in_the_Number_of_Genes_Inferred_from_Draft_Genome_Assemblies","267742905_The_Genomes_OnLine_Database_GOLD_v5_A_metadata_management_system_based_on_a_four_level_metagenome_project_classification","311424207_Ultrafast_and_memory-efficient_alignment_of_short_DNA_sequences_to_the_human_genome","292783731_Scaffolding_of_Ancient_Contigs_and_Ancestral_Reconstruction_in_a_Phylogenetic_Framework","282621487_A_complexity_and_approximation_framework_for_the_maximization_scaffolding_problem","281920240_Complexity_and_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Algorithms_around_the_Scaffolding_Problem","281387823_Space-efficient_and_exact_de_Bruijn_graph_representation_based_on_a_Bloom_filter","274261060_Scaffold_assembly_based_on_genome_rearrangement_analysis","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity"]}
