{"id":"228425153_Investigation_into_Knapsack","abstract":"The 0/1 Knapsack problem has been a highly researched problem in computer science dating back to the 1970's when it was first proven to be a NP-complete problem. There have been many different algorithms developed that can solve the knapsack problem, and all of them have different benefits and drawbacks associated with them. We intend to study five different algorithms that can be used to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem and determine what types of datasets these algorithms will be successful and when they will fail.","authors":["Wesley Kerr"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["220375001_An_Overview_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Parameter_Optimization","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220432022_Fast_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Knapsack_and_Sum_of_Subset_Problems","44534100_Computers_and_intractibility_A_guide_to_the_theory_of_NP-_Completeness_Michael_R_Garey_David_S_Johnson","4354709_Fast_approximation_algorithms_for_knapsack_problems","2777138_The_0-1_Knapsack_Problem_-_An_Introductory_Survey"]}
