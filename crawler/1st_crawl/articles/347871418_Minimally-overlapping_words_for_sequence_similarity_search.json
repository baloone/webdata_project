{"id":"347871418_Minimally-overlapping_words_for_sequence_similarity_search","abstract":"Motivation\nAnalysis of genetic sequences is usually based on finding similar parts of sequences, e.g. DNA reads and/or genomes. For big data, this is typically done via “seeds”: simple similarities (e.g. exact matches) that can be found quickly. For huge data, sparse seeding is useful, where we only consider seeds at a subset of positions in a sequence.\n\nResults\nHere we study a simple sparse-seeding method: using seeds at positions of certain “words” (e.g. ac, at, gc, or gt). Sensitivity is maximized by using words with minimal overlaps. That is because, in a random sequence, minimally-overlapping words are anti-clumped. We provide evidence that this is often superior to acclaimed “minimizer” sparse-seeding methods. Our approach can be unified with design of inexact (spaced and subset) seeds, further boosting sensitivity. Thus, we present a promising approach to sequence similarity search, with open questions on how to optimize it.\n\nAvailability and Implementation\nSoftware to design and test minimally-overlapping words is freely available at https://gitlab.com/mcfrith/noverlap.\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Martin C Frith","Laurent Noé","Gregory Kucherov"],"meta":["December 2020Bioinformatics 36(22-23)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1054"],"references":["341337346_Terminating_contamination_Large-scale_search_identifies_more_than_2000000_contaminated_entries_in_GenBank","327641501_A_fast_adaptive_algorithm_for_computing_whole-genome_homology_maps","326100778_Asymptotically_optimal_minimizers_schemes","323663940_Improving_the_performance_of_minimizers_and_winnowing_schemes","322877594_Comparing_fixed_sampling_with_minimizer_sampling_when_using_k-mer_indexes_to_find_maximal_exact_matches","320178008_Designing_small_universal_k-mer_hitting_sets_for_improved_analysis_of_high-throughput_sequencing","309285807_rasbhari_Optimizing_Spaced_Seeds_for_Database_Searching_Read_Mapping_and_Alignment-Free_Sequence_Comparison","266859824_An_improved_branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","263736737_KMC_2_Fast_and_resource-frugal_k-mer_counting","325106640_Minimap2_Pairwise_alignment_for_nucleotide_sequences"]}
