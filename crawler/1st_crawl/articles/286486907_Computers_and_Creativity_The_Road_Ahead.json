{"id":"286486907_Computers_and_Creativity_The_Road_Ahead","abstract":"This final chapter proposes a number of questions that we think are important for future research in relation to computers and creativity. Many of these questions have emerged in one form or another in the preceding chapters and are divided into four categories as follows: how computers can enhance human creativity; whether computer art can ever be properly valued; what computing can tell us about creativity; and how creativity and computing can be brought together in learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.
