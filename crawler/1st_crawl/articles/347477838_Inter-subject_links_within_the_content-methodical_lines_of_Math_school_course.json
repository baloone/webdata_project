The course of Math at school is permeated with inter-subject links, which are the foundation of the subject and through which a succession is implemented in teaching of Mathematics. The implementation of inter-subject links in teaching Mathematics requires a special organization of educational material and the process of its study and, therefore, acts as a didactic principle. In this paper, inter-subject links are revealed at two levels: the level of content and the level of methods for solving problems. The inter-subject links at the substantial level are learning numerical sequences and linear equations and inequalities, while at the level of methods - examples of transcendental equations. The implementation of inter-subject links at the content level takes place in conjunction with their implementation at the level of methods and has a wide practical application at Mathematics lessons. The conducted researches have shown that inter-subject links naturally extend on the subject area Mathematics and Computer Science according to the Federal state educational standards of the basic and secondary general education. The practical significance of the study is that its results can be used for teaching Mathematics at school.","authors":["Natalya Vasilievna Kononenko","Julia Sergeevna Tokareva","Pavel Aleksandrovich Chukhriy"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.17816/snv201983310"],"references":[]}
