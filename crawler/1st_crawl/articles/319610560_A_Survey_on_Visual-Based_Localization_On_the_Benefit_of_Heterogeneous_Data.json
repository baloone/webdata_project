{"id":"319610560_A_Survey_on_Visual-Based_Localization_On_the_Benefit_of_Heterogeneous_Data","abstract":"We are surrounded by plenty of information about our environment. From these multiple sources, numerous data could be extracted: set of images, 3D model, coloured points cloud. When classical localization devices failed (e.g. GPS sensor in cluttered environments), aforementioned data could be used within a localization framework. This is called Visual Based Localization (VBL). Due to numerous data types that can be collected from a scene, VBL encompasses a large amount of different methods. This paper presents a survey about recent methods that localize a visual acquisition system according to a known environment. We start by categorizing VBL methods into two distinct families: indirect and direct localization systems. As the localization environment is almost always dynamic, we pay special attention to methods designed to handle appearances changes occurring in a scene. Thereafter, we highlight methods exploiting heterogeneous types of data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on promising trends that could permit to a localization system to reach high precision pose estimation within an area as large as possible.","authors":["Nathan Piasco","Désiré Sidibé","Cédric Demonceaux","Valérie Gouet-Brunet"],"meta":["September 2017Pattern Recognition 74(X)","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2017.09.013"],"references":["321815853_Improving_condition-_and_environment-invariant_place_recognition_with_semantic_place_categorization","319535111_Learned_Contextual_Feature_Reweighting_for_Image_Geo-Localization","318474151_Retrieving_real_world_clothing_images_via_multi-weight_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","317191080_Filtering_3D_Keypoints_Using_GIST_For_Accurate_Image-Based_Localization","317083797_Hamming_Embedding_and_Weak_Geometric_Consistency_for_Large_Scale_Image_Search","316902678_Cross-domain_image_localization_by_adaptive_feature_fusion","316004565_FreMEn_Frequency_Map_Enhancement_for_Long-Term_Mobile_Robot_Autonomy_in_Changing_Environments","315849902_State-of-the-art_in_visual_geo-localization","315788135_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Hand-Crafted_and_Learned_Local_Features","315116078_Convolutional_neural_network_architecture_for_geometric_matching","313524182_On-the-Fly_Adaptation_of_Regression_Forests_for_Online_Camera_Relocalisation","310820349_CNN_vs_SIFT_for_Image_Retrieval_Alternative_or_Complementary","310743341_Image_features_for_visual_teach-and-repeat_navigation_in_changing_environments","309797671_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_6-DOF_Image_Localization","345143870_Enhancing_Place_Recognition_Using_Joint_Intensity_-_Depth_Analysis_and_Synthetic_Data","342750619_Large-scale_real-time_visual-inertial_localization_revisited","329748112_Towards_CNN_Map_Representation_and_Compression_for_Camera_Relocalisation","322058819_TorontoCity_Seeing_the_World_with_a_Million_Eyes","322058592_Revisiting_IM2GPS_in_the_Deep_Learning_Era","321217693_Relative_Camera_Pose_Estimation_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","320972016_Geometric_Loss_Functions_for_Camera_Pose_Regression_with_Deep_Learning","320971103_Cross-View_Image_Matching_for_Geo-Localization_in_Urban_Environments","320968206_Pyramid_Scene_Parsing_Network","320965316_On-the-Fly_Adaptation_of_Regression_Forests_for_Online_Camera_Relocalisation","320965011_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Architecture_for_Geometric_Matching","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","319770370_Three_things_everyone_should_know_to_improve_object_retrieval","319770284_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges","319770010_Local_Convolutional_Features_with_Unsupervised_Training_for_Image_Retrieval","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","318689568_Random_forests_versus_Neural_Networks_-_What's_best_for_camera_localization","318344959_Multi-modal_Feature_Fusion_for_Geographic_Image_Annotation","317820104_Improving_Condition-_and_Environment-Invariant_Place_Recognition_with_Semantic_Place_Categorization","317693172_GeoPose3K_Mountain_Landscape_Dataset_for_Camera_Pose_Estimation_in_Outdoor_Environments","317193735_Exploiting_Random_RGB_and_Sparse_Features_for_Camera_Pose_Estimation","317161158_Panorama_to_Panorama_Matching_for_Location_Recognition","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","315928425_Are_Large-Scale_3D_Models_Really_Necessary_for_Accurate_Visual_Localization","314635458_Visual_Place_Recognition_Using_Landmark_Distribution_Descriptors","314270723_Content_based_image_retrieval_with_sparse_representations_and_local_feature_descriptors_A_comparative_study","314200686_Indoor_Relocalization_in_Challenging_Environments_With_Dual-Stream_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","314182407_Towards_CNN_Map_Compression_for_camera_relocalisation","314115680_Billion-Scale_Similarity_Search_with_GPUs","313682839_247_Place_Recognition_by_View_Synthesis","313394916_Relative_Camera_Pose_Estimation_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","312830648_Visual_Vocabulary_with_a_Semantic_Twist","311611056_Large-Scale_Location_Recognition_and_the_Geometric_Burstiness_Problem","311240888_1_year_1000_km_The_Oxford_RobotCar_dataset","310602611_Neural_Bag-of-Features_Learning","309424820_End-to-End_Learning_of_Deep_Visual_Representations_for_Image_Retrieval","308864003_Vehicle_localization_using_mono-camera_and_geo-referenced_traffic_signs","309612842_Night-time_indoor_relocalization_using_depth_image_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","308879480_Photogrammetric_Computer_Vision","308862106_Pairwise_geometric_matching_for_large-scale_object_retrieval"]}
