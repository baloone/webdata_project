{"id":"220154144_Natural_computation_and_non-Turing_models_of_computation","abstract":"We propose certain non-Turing models of computation, but our intent is not to advocate models that surpass the power of Turing Machines (TMs), but to de- fend the need for models with orthogonal notions of power. We review the na- ture of models and argue that they are relative to a domain of application and are ill-suited to use outside that domain. Hence we review the presuppositions and context of the TM model and show that it is unsuited to natural computation (computation occurring in or inspired by nature). Therefore we must consider an expanded definition of computation that includes alternative (especially ana- log) models as well as the TM. Finally we present an alternative model, of con- tinuous computation, more suited to natural computation. We conclude with remarks on the expressivity of formal mathematics.","authors":["Bruce Maclennan"],"meta":["June 2004Theoretical Computer Science 317(1-3):115-145","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2003.12.008","SourceDBLP"],"references":["257824046_Transcending_Turing_Computability","222105183_Continuous_Symbol_Systems_The_Logic_of_Connectionism","222105179_Logic_for_the_New_AI","222105178_Technology-independent_Design_of_Neurocomputers_The_Universal_Field_Computer","210304600_On_a_Theory_of_Computation_and_Complexity_over_the_Real_Numbers_NP-Completeness_Recursive_Functions_and_Universal_Machines","37532524_Grounding_Symbols_in_the_Analog_World_with_Neural_Nets","28762616_Continuous_Computation_and_the_Emergence_of_the_Discrete","3498779_On_a_theory_of_computation_over_the_real_numbers_NP_completeness_recursive_functions_and_universal_machines","2716226_Field_Computation_A_Theoretical_Framework_for_Massively_Parallel_Analog_Computation_Parts_I_--_IV","2419798_Words_Lie_in_our_Way","2364176_Can_Differential_Equations_Compute","2329291_Grounding_Analog_Computers","2307695_Continuous_Formal_Systems_A_Unifying_Model_in_Language_and_Cognition","292812531_Complete_discrete_2-d_gabor_transforms_by_neural_networks_for_image_analysis_and_compression","284150994_The_representation_of_Boolean_algebras","284081056_Uncertainty_relation_for_resolution_in_space_spatial_frequency_and_orientation_optimized_by_two-dimensional_visual_cortical_filters","268651696_Lattices_and_topological_spaces","268499083_Topology_without_points","266508126_Universal_limit_Turing_machines","266190195_Elementary_General_Topology","265989800_Partially_ordered_sets_separating_systems_and_inductiveness","265660416_The_Theory_of_Algorithms","265365686_Qualitative_Theory_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","264949524_An_Introduction_to_Natural_Computation","260477020_Analog_VLSI_and_neural_systems","257051024_The_Extended_Analog_Computer","248291502_The_symbol_grounding_problem","247162040_The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem","245112152_A_Theory_of_Computation_and_Complexity_over_the_real_numbers","243775087_Mathematical_theory_of_the_differential_analyzer","243757740_An_information-theoretic_view_of_analog_rep-resentation_in_striate_cortex","243077936_Abstract_Computability_and_Its_Relation_to_the_General_Purpose_Analog_Computer_Some_Connections_Between_Logic_Differential_Equations_and_Analog_Computers","243074622_Applications_of_the_Theory_of_Boolean_Rings_to_General_Topology","242650242_The_Theory_of_Representations_for_Boolean_Algebras","223885600_Field_Computation_in_Natural_and_Artificial_Intelligence","222504328_Field_Computation_in_Motor_Control","222476328_Recursion_Theory_on_the_Reals_and_Continuous-Time_Computation","222443035_Characteristics_of_Connectionist_Knowledge_Representation","222105182_Field_Computation_in_the_Brain","221557186_Continuous_Information_Representation_and_Processing_In_Natural_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks","221206341_Topological_algorithms","50334067_Introduction_to_Topology","38390255_A_universal_differential_equation","19140456_Uncertainty_relation_for_resolution_in_space_spatial_frequency_and_orientation_optimized_by_two-dimensional_visual_cortical_filters","17644235_Mental_Rotation_of_Three-Dimensional_Objects","16688785_Spatial_visual_channels_in_the_Fourier_plane","7192503_Partially_Ordered_Sets_and_Topology","3551535_Outline_of_a_theory_of_massively_parallel_analog_computation","3175286_Complete_Discrete_2-D_Gabor_Transforms_by_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Analysis_and_Compression_IEEE_Trans_on_Acoustics_Speech_and_Signal_Processing_361169-1179","2456541_Beyond_The_Universal_Turing_Machine","2252199_Gabor_Representations_of_Spatiotemporal_Visual_Images"]}
