{"id":"285270715_Well-Balanced_Nodal_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Method_for_Euler_Equations_with_Gravity","abstract":"We present a well-balanced nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for\ncompressible Euler equations with gravity. The DG scheme makes use of\ndiscontinuous Lagrange basis functions supported at Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre\n(GLL) nodes together with GLL quadrature using the same nodes. The\nwell-balanced property is achieved by a specific form of source term\ndiscretization that depends on the nature of the hydrostatic solution, together\nwith the GLL nodes for quadrature of the source term. The scheme is able to\npreserve isothermal and polytropic stationary solutions upto machine precision\non any mesh composed of quadrilateral cells and for any gravitational\npotential. It is applied on several examples to demonstrate its well-balanced\nproperty and the improved resolution of small perturbations around the\nstationary solution.","authors":["Praveen Chandrashekar","Markus Zenk"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Scientific Computing 71(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-016-0339-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283897756_Well-Balanced_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Methods_for_the_Euler_Equations_Under_Gravitational_Fields","281444700_A_SECOND_ORDER_WELL-BALANCED_FINITE_VOLUME_SCHEME_FOR_EULER_EQUATIONS_WITH_GRAVITY","277907270_A_Second_Order_Well-Balanced_Finite_Volume_Scheme_for_Euler_Equations_with_Gravity","314820229_Quadrature-free_implementation_of_discontinuous_Galerkin_method_for_hyperbolic_equations","312370910_Wave_propagation_methods_for_conservation_laws_with_source_terms","260666265_Exactly_well-balanced_discontinuous_Galerkin_methods_for_the_shallow_water_equations_with_moving_water_equilibrium","259505862_Well-balanced_schemes_for_the_Euler_equations_with_gravitation","255813563_High_Order_Well-Balanced_WENO_Scheme_for_the_Gas_Dynamics_Equations_Under_Gravitational_Fields","243770478_Numerical_Approximation_of_Hyperbolic_System_of_Conservation_Laws","243768049_Riemann_Solvers_and_Numerical_Method_for_Fluid_Dynamics_-_A_Practical_Introduction"]}
