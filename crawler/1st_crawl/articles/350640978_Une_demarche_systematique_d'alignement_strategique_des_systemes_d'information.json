With the evolution of Information and Communication Technologies(ICT), information systems have become complex and difficult to master in the absence of the necessary metricsand the assistanceof all stakeholders. Previous researcheson AS arecategorized into two approaches: conceptual and diagnostic. The first aims todefine the AS and the secondproposesways to measure its success. These two approaches are criticized for not responding to the concerns of managers. Thus, a new processes and actions centred approach has emerged. Within this framework, we propose a method centered objectives, processes and functions. This methodis based on the use of metricsto determine the portfolio of IS projects to be carried outwith the aimto align the ISwith the strategy of the organization. We illustrate the implementation of the method through a case study.","authors":["Salah Jadda","Nawfal ACHA","Hafid BARKA"],"meta":["April 2021","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4595809"],"references":[]}
