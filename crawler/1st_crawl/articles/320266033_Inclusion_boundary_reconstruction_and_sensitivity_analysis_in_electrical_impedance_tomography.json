{"id":"320266033_Inclusion_boundary_reconstruction_and_sensitivity_analysis_in_electrical_impedance_tomography","abstract":"Reconstruction of conductive inclusions in a homogeneous background medium is commonly seen in electrical impedance tomography (EIT). One of the methods to deal with the inclusion reconstruction problems is the shape-based method. With prior knowledge of conductivity of target inclusions, the boundary of inclusions is parameterized by several shape coefficients and recovered from EIT measurements. This paper presents a shape-based inclusion reconstruction method and its numerical implementation with boundary element method (BEM). A shape perturbation method (SPM) is proposed to calculate the shape sensitivity in EIT. To evaluate the accuracy of the presented method, a series of numerical tests are conducted. The characteristics of EIT shape sensitivity are analysed. Some factors influencing the reconstruction performance are discussed.","authors":["Shang-Jie Ren","Manuchehr Soleimani","Y Y Xu","Feng Dong"],"meta":["October 2017Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering 26(4):1-25","DOI:10.1080/17415977.2017.1378195","Project: Shape inverse method for Discontinuous Impedance Distributions"],"references":["310764345_Convergence_study_of_2_D_forward_problem_of_electrical_impedance_tomography_with_high-order_finite_elements","295097598_Solving_the_complete-electrode_direct_model_of_ERT_using_the_boundary_element_method_and_the_method_of_fundamental_solutions","262979993_Reconstruction_of_the_three-dimensional_inclusion_shapes_using_electrical_capacitance_tomography","280172567_Resolution-Controlled_Conductivity_Discretization_in_Electrical_Impedance_Tomography","279958004_Boundary_element_techniques_Theory_and_applications_in_engineering","263480765_A_conformal_mapping_method_in_inverse_obstacle_scattering","262894058_A_Matlab_toolkit_for_three-dimensional_electrical_impedance_tomography_a_contribution_to_the_Electrical_Impedance_and_Diffuse_Optical_Reconstruction_Software_project","260622654_Sensitivity_Calculations_for_Poisson's_Equation_via_the_Adjoint_Field_Method","258275573_Integral_equation_methods_for_the_inverse_obstacle_problem_with_generalized_impedance_boundary_condition","257524225_Diagnosis_of_Breast_Cancer_Using_Electrical_Impedance_Tomography","257396463_Galerkin_boundary_element_method_for_the_forward_problem_of_ERT","245588919_Boundary_Element_Techniques_for_efficient_2-D_and_3-D_Electrical_Impedance_Tomography","239981253_Existence_and_Uniqueness_for_Electrode_Models_for_Electric_Current_Computed_Tomography","239374604_Application_of_Electrical_Resistance_Tomography_to_Two-phase_Pipe_Flow_Parameters_Measurement","231056501_A_Matlab_based_toolkit_for_three-dimensional_electrical_impedance_tomography_A_contribution_to_the_EIDORS_project"]}
