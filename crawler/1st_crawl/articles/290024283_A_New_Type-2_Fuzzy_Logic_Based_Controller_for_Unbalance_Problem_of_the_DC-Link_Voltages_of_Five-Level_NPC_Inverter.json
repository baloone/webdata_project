{"id":"290024283_A_New_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Controller_for_Unbalance_Problem_of_the_DC-Link_Voltages_of_Five-Level_NPC_Inverter","abstract":"This paper describes a new dc-link voltages controller based on interval type-2 fuzzy systems for the cascade made up by two pulse width-modulation current source rectifiers and fivelevel inverter supplying an induction motor. The dc-link voltages balancing issue is addressed and a new balancing circuit with reduced number of power switches is proposed. Of particular interest, the used cascade guarantees balanced capacitors voltage and provides sinusoidal line currents having nearly unity input power factor. The power converters and the associated control algorithms based on the newly emerged type 2 fuzzy systems are presented and a set of simulations are carried out in order to highlight the good performances of the proposed control scheme. Moreover, a comparison between a type-2 fuzzy controller and a PI controller is made.","authors":["S.
