{"id":"264046371_A_Hypergraph_Kernel_from_Isomorphism_Tests","abstract":"In this paper, we present a hypergraph kernel computed using\nsubstructure isomorphism tests. Measuring the isomorphisms between\nhypergraphs straightforwardly tends to be elusive since a hypergraph\nmay exhibit varying relational orders. We thus transform a\nhypergraph into a directed line graph. This not only accurately\nreflects the multiple relationships exhibited by the hypergraph but\nis also easier to manipulate isomorphism tests. To locate the\nisomorphisms between hypergraphs through their directed line graphs,\nwe propose a new directed Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test for\ndirected graphs. The new isomorphism test precisely reflects the\nstructure of the directed edges. By identifying the isomorphic\nsubstructures of directed graphs, the hypergraph kernel for a pair\nof hypergraphs is computed by counting the number of pairwise\nisomorphic substructures from their directed line graphs. We show\nthat our kernel limits tottering that arises in\nthe existing walk and subtree based (hyper)graph kernels.\nExperiments on challenging (hyper)graph datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our kernel.","authors":["Lu Bai","Peng Ren","Edwin Robert Hancock"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICPR.2014.665","Conference: International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2014"],"references":["251275816_Witten_IH_Frank_E_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","234786663_Fast_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines_Using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization","221620453_Learning_with_Hypergraphs_Clustering_Classification_and_Embedding","322715583_Data_Mining_practical_machine_learning_tools_and_techniques","261357339_A_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Graph_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","260707708_Backtrackless_Walks_on_a_Graph","247372464_A_reduction_of_a_Graph_to_a_Canonical_Form_and_an_Algebra_Arising_during_this_Reduction_in_Russian","236110992_Graph_Kernels_from_the_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","229078404_Machines_using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization","221900847_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_And_Techniques"]}
