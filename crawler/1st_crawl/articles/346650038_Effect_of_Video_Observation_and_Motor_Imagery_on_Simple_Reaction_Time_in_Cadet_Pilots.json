{"id":"346650038_Effect_of_Video_Observation_and_Motor_Imagery_on_Simple_Reaction_Time_in_Cadet_Pilots","abstract":"Neuromotor training can improve motor performance in athletes and patients. However, few data are available about their effect on reaction time (RT). We investigated the influence of video observation/motor imagery (VO/MI) on simple RT to visual and auditory stimuli. The experimental group comprised 21 cadets who performed VO/MI training over 4 weeks. Nineteen cadets completed a sham intervention as control. The main outcome measure was RT to auditory and visual stimuli for the upper and lower limbs. The RT to auditory stimuli improved significantly post-intervention in both groups (control vs. experimental mean change for upper limbs: −40 ms vs. −40 ms, p = 0.0008; for lower limbs: −50 ms vs. −30 ms, p = 0.0174). A trend towards reduced RT to visual stimuli was observed (for upper limbs: −30 ms vs. −20 ms, p = 0.0876; for lower limbs: −30 ms vs. −20 ms, p = 0.0675). The interaction term was not significant. Only the specific VO/MI training produced a linear correlation between the improvement in the RT to auditory and visual stimuli for the upper (r = 0.703) and lower limbs (r = 0.473). In conclusion, VO/MI training does not improve RT when compared to control, but it may be useful in individuals who need to simultaneously develop a fast response to different types of stimuli.","authors":["Felice Sirico","Veronica Romano","Anna Maria Sacco","Immacolata Belviso"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology 5(89)","DOI:10.3390/jfmk5040089"],"references":["341651340_Effectiveness_of_Workplace_Yoga_Interventions_to_Reduce_Perceived_Stress_in_Employees_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","335864776_Jump_and_balance_test_in_judo_athletes_with_or_without_visual_impairments","319868726_Enhancement_of_motor_skill_learning_by_a_combination_of_ideal_model-observation_and_self-observation","319402332_The_impact_of_stress_on_body_function_A_review","315581876_The_future_for_PETTLEP_A_modern_perspective_on_an_effective_and_established_tool","308839928_Do_Brain-Training_Programs_Work","339686493_Effectiveness_of_Tai_Chi_on_Balance_Improvement_in_Type_2_Diabetes_Patients_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","326099950_A_Pilot_Study_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Sleep_Deprivation_on_Analogue_Measures_of_Pilot_Competencies","322922850_Pilot_workload_and_fatigue_on_four_intra-European_routes_a_12-month_mixed-methods_evaluation","320057506_European_Journal_of_Sport_Science_Do_the_physical_and_environment_PETTLEP_elements_predict_sport_imagery_ability"]}
