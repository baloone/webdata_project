{"id":"305954205_The_role_of_ICT_self-efficacy_for_students'_ICT_use_and_their_achievement_in_a_computer_and_information_literacy_test","abstract":"Students' self-efficacy in using information and communication technology (ICT) is among the most important motivational constructs that are related to their ICT acceptance, use, and literacy. The present study attempts to generate new knowledge about the role of ICT self-efficacy for students' ICT use and their computer and information literacy (CIL). Using the Norwegian data obtained from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) in 2013 (N = 2,410 students in grade level 9), we distinguish between self-efficacy in basic and advanced ICT skills and examine the relations to studentsâ€™ ICT use for different purposes (school-related task learning, study purposes, and recreation) and their achievement in a CIL test. The results show that: (1) self-efficacy in basic ICT skills is positively related to CIL achievement, whereas self-efficacy in advanced ICT skills shows a negative relation; (2) ICT use and ICT self-efficacy are positively correlated for some of the ICT use purposes; (3) there is an indirect effects of ICT use on CIL achievement via ICT self-efficacy; (4) this indirect effect holds for both female and male students. Our findings point to a potential mechanism that links ICT use, self-efficacy, and CIL. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.","authors":["Anubha Rohatgi","Ronny Scherer","Ove Edvard Hatlevik"],"meta":["August 2016Computers & Education
