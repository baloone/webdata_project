{"id":"342220042_Complete_Topological_Mapping_of_a_Cellular_Protein_Interactome_Reveals_Bow-Tie_Motifs_as_Ubiquitous_Connectors_of_Protein_Complexes","abstract":"The network topology of a protein interactome is shaped by the function of each protein, making it a resource of functional knowledge in tissues and in single cells. Today, this resource is underused, as complete network topology characterization has proved difficult for large protein interactomes. We apply a matrix visualization and decoding approach to a physical protein interactome of a dendritic cell, thereby characterizing its topology with no prior assumptions of structure. We discover 294 proteins, each forming topological motifs called “bow-ties” that tie together the majority of observed protein complexes. The central proteins of these bow-ties have unique network properties, display multifunctional capabilities, are enriched for essential proteins, and are widely expressed in other cells and tissues. Collectively, the bow-tie motifs are a pervasive and previously unnoted topological trend in cellular interactomes. As such, these results provide fundamental knowledge on how intracellular protein connectivity is organized and operates.","authors":["Kristoffer Niss","Cristina Gomez-Casado","Jessica X.
