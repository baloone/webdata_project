{"id":"221557261_Bipartite_Embeddings_of_Trees_in_the_Plane","abstract":"In this paper we consider the following embedding problem. A point set P in the plane in general position is partitioned into two disjoint sets R and B, and we are asked to embed a tree T in P without crossings and with the additional property that all the edges connect a point in R to another point in B. We study several problems related to such bipartite embeddings.","authors":["Manuel Abellanas","Jesus Garcia-Lopez","Gregorio Hernandez","Marc Noy"],"meta":["January 1996Discrete Applied Mathematics 93(2):1-10","SourceDBLP","Conference: Graph Drawing, Symposium on Graph Drawing, GD '96, Berkeley, California, USA, September 18-20, Proceedings"],"references":["220111842_Degree_Constrained_Tree_Embedding_Into_Points_in_the_Plane"]}
