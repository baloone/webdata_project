{"id":"275279894_Route_Planning_in_Transportation_Networks","abstract":"We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation\nnetworks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in\nmilliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide\ndifferent trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and\nquery time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond,\nwhile others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on\npublic transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a\nsignificantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and\nmulticriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive\nqueries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances\nrequires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning\nproblem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses,\ntrains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on\napproximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.","authors":["Hannah Bast","Daniel Delling","Andrew Goldberg","Matthias MÃ¼ller-Hannemann"],"meta":["April 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["302741547_Graph_partitioning_with_natural_cuts","300450292_Hub_Labels_Theory_and_Practice","318779856_Parallel_Computation_of_Best_Connections_in_Public_Transportation_Networks","313423525_Stochastic_delay_prediction_in_large_train_networks","308264305_Towards_Mobile_Time-Dependent_Route_Planning","307632051_Ultrafast_shortest-path_queries_via_transit_nodes","301928765_Customizing_Driving_Directions_with_GPUs","301724923_Distance_Oracles_for_Time-Dependent_Networks","301439727_Frequency-based_search_for_public_transit","300356033_Robust_Distance_Queries_on_Massive_Networks"]}
