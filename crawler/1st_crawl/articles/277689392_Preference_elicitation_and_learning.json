{"id":"277689392_Preference_elicitation_and_learning","abstract":"Preferences are fundamental to decision processes, because decision analysts must account for the preferences of the stakeholders who participate in these processes and are impacted by the decision outcomes. To support the elicitation of stakeholder preferences, many models, procedures and methodologies have been proposed.These approaches to preference elicitation and learning will become more and more important with the proliferation of semi-automated computerized interfaces and the adoption of decision support systems which build on increasingly large datasets.","authors":["Vincent Mousseau","Marc Pirlot"],"meta":["May 2015EURO Journal on Decision Processes 3(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s40070-015-0044-2"],"references":["276559232_Elicitation_of_2-additive_bi-capacity_parameters","276398655_Extension_of_the_MACBETH_approach_to_elicit_an_ordered_weighted_average_operator","273136123_Minimax_Regret_Approaches_for_Preference_Elicitation_with_Rank-Dependent_Aggregators","228877056_Eliciting_ELECTRE_TRI_category_limits_for_a_group_of_decision_makers","282309033_Evaluation_and_Decision_Models_With_Multiple_Criteria_Case_Studies","262392499_Robust_ordinal_regression_for_multiple_criteria_group_decision_UTAGMS-GROUP_and_UTADISGMS-GROUP","235660556_Justifying_Dominating_Options_when_Preferential_Information_is_Incomplete","227414919_Preference_disaggregation_and_statistical_learning_for_multicriteria_decision_support_A_review","222683672_A_review_of_methods_for_capacity_identification_in_Choquet_integral_based_multi-attribute_utility_theory_Applications_of_the_Kappalab_R_package","220546585_A_general_framework_for_explaining_the_results_of_a_multi-attribute_preference_model"]}
