{"id":"328096023_Sharp_Bounds_for_partition_dimension_of_Generalized_Mobius_Ladder","abstract":"The concept of minimal resolving partition and resolving set\nplays a pivotal role in diverse areas such as robot navigation, networking,\noptimization, mastermind games and coin weighing. It is hard to\ncompute exact values of partition dimension for a graphic metric space,\n(G; dG) and networks. In the present article, we give the sharp upper\nbounds and lower bounds for the partition dimension of generalized\nM¨obius ladders, Mm;n, for all n � 3 and m � 2.","authors":["Mobeen Munir","Muhammad Shoaib Saleem","Zaffar Hussain","Zaffar Iqbal"],"meta":["December 2018Open Mathematics 16(1)","DOI:10.1515/math-2018-0109","Project: Dimensions of some graphs"],"references":["326609997_Computing_Metric_Dimension_and_Metric_Basis_of_2D_Lattice_of_Alpha-Boron_Nanotubes","325232338_Super_a_d_-_C_4_-antimagicness_of_book_graphs","267657439_Metric_dimension_of_wheels","267474657_On_the_metric_dimension_of_Mobius_ladders","265368874_On_Metric_and_Partition_Dimensions_of_Some_Infinite_Regular_Graphs","324826257_Wiener_polarity_index_of_quasi-tree_molecular_structures","268766527_Remarks_on_Detection_Problems","265443592_Dominating_and_reference_sets_in_a_graph","265367217_The_metric_dimension_of_unicyclic_graphs","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
