{"id":"319553465_Lessons_from_culturally_contrasted_alternative_methods_of_inquiry_and_styles_of_comprehension_for_the_new_foundations_in_the_study_of_life","abstract":"Contemporary scientific approaches to Biology are the result of some cultural ideas considered as universal by Western reductionist traditions. The study of the cultural, symbolic and historical approaches to reality and Life provides us important lessons about the necessity of integrating Eastern holistic views into the study of Life. This is both an epistemological and ontological enhancement which provides more powerful and insightful ways to deal with Life and its understanding.","authors":["Jordi Vallverdu","Marcin J.
