{"id":"330928585_Using_paradata_to_collect_better_survey_data_Evidence_from_a_household_survey_in_Tanzania","abstract":"Data are a key component in the design, implementation, and evaluation of economic and social policies. Monitoring data quality is an essential part of any serious, large‐scale data collection process. The purpose of this article is to show how paradata should be used before, during, and after data collection to monitor and improve data quality. To do this we use timestamps, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, and other paradata collected from an 800‐household survey conducted in Tanzania in 2016. We demonstrate how key paradata can be used during each phase of a research project to identify and prevent issues in the data and the methods used to collect it. Our results corroborate the importance of collecting and analyzing paradata to monitor fieldwork and ensuring data quality for micro data collection in developing countries. Based on these findings we also make recommendations as to how researchers can make better use of paradata in the future to manage and improve data quality. We argue for an expansion in the understanding and use of varied paradata among researchers, and a greater focus on its use for improving data quality.","authors":["Johanna Choumert‐Nkolo","Henry Cust","Callum Taylor"],"meta":["February 2019Review of Development Economics 23(4)","DOI:10.1111/rode.12583"],"references":["315440535_Agriculture_in_Africa_-_Telling_myths_from_facts_A_synthesis","311453883_Investigating_Multiple_Household_Water_Sources_and_Uses_with_a_Computer-Assisted_Personal_Interviewing_CAPI_Survey","283256282_Poverty_in_a_Rising_Afirca","282419926_Interviewer_Effects_in_Subjective_Survey_Questions_Evidence_From_Timor-Leste","281772466_Who_counts_Challenges_and_biases_in_defining_'households'_in_research_on_poverty","280660447_Analyzing_Paradata_to_Investigate_Measurement_Error","276377105_From_Tragedy_to_Renaissance_Improving_Agricultural_Data_for_Better_Policies","276043033_A_Comparison_of_Tablet-Based_and_Paper-Based_Survey_Data_Collection_in_Conservation_Projects","269629260_Poverty_in_African_Households_the_Limits_of_Survey_and_Census_Representations","257072756_A_Novel_Electronic_Data_Collection_System_for_Large-Scale_Surveys_of_Neglected_Tropical_Diseases","228313253_Reliability_of_Recall_in_Agricultural_Data","225307427_The_Effect_of_Interview_Method_on_Self-Reported_Sexual_Behavior_and_Perceptions_of_Community_Norms_in_Botswana","46513295_Using_Global_Positioning_Systems_in_Household_Surveys_for_Better_Economics_and_Better_Policy","44132207_The_effect_of_computer-assisted_interviewing_on_data_quality_a_review_of_the_evidence","346959916_Poverty_in_a_Rising_Africa","346918584_Developing_a_socially_inclusive_and_sustainable_natural_gas_sector_in_Tanzania","320579781_Not_your_average_job_Measuring_farm_labor_in_Tanzania","315907369_How_Much_Should_We_Trust_Micro-data_A_Comparison_of_the_Socio-demographic_Profile_of_Malawian_Households_Using_Census_LSMS_and_DHS_data","311480877_How_Much_Will_a_Data_Revolution_in_Development_Cost","302055691_The_Challenge_of_Measuring_Hunger_through_Survey","299541003_Africa_by_numbers_Reviewing_the_database_approach_to_studying_African_economies","299519259_When_the_Data_Source_Writes_the_Conclusion_Evaluating_Agricultural_Policies","279342999_Survey_Paradata_A_Review","274266017_The_Invisibility_of_Wage_Employment_in_Statistics_on_the_Informal_Economy_in_Africa_Causes_and_Consequences","274265920_Statistical_Tragedy_in_Africa_Evaluating_the_Data_Base_for_African_Economic_Development","266339025_Household_Interview_Duration_Analysis_in_CAPI_Survey_Management","260138621_Using_Paradata_to_Explore_Item_Level_Response_Times_in_Surveys","254946491_Challenges_and_Opportunities_of_Mobile_Phone-Based_Data_Collection_Evidence_from_South_Sudan","240711087_From_Papi_to_Capi_The_Case_of_the_British_Household_Panel_Survey","229338934_Improving_consumption_measurement_and_other_survey_data_through_CAPI_Evidence_from_a_randomized_experiment","223587701_First_impressions_count_Interviewer_appearance_and_information_effects_in_stated_preference_studies","31402548_Reaching_Migrants_in_Survey_Research_The_Use_of_the_Global_Positioning_System_to_Reduce_Coverage_Bias_in_China"]}
