{"id":"313348019_To_Cognize_is_to_Categorize_Cognition_is_Categorization","abstract":"We organisms are sensorimotor systems. The things in the world come in contact with our sensory surfaces, and we interact with them based on what that sensorimotor contact “affords”. All of our categories consist in ways we behave differently toward different kinds of things -- things we do or don’t eat, mate-with, or flee-from, or the things that we describe, through our language, as prime numbers, affordances, absolute discriminables, or truths. That is all that cognition is for, and about.","authors":["Stevan Harnad"],"meta":["December 2005","Conference: Summer Institute in Cognitive Sciences on Categorisation"],"references":[]}
