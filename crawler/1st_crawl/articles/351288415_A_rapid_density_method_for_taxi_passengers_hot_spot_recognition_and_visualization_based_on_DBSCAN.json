{"id":"351288415_A_rapid_density_method_for_taxi_passengers_hot_spot_recognition_and_visualization_based_on_DBSCAN","abstract":"With the development of city size and vehicle interconnection, visual analysis technology is playing a very important role in the course of city calculation and city perception. A Reasonable visual model can effectively present the feature of city. In order to solve the problem of traditional density algorithm that cluster the large scale data slowly and cannot find cluster centers to adapt taxi track data. The DBSCAN+ (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise plus) algorithm that can split data and extract maximum density clusters under the large scale data was proposed in the paper. The passenger points should be cleaned from the original point of the passenger trajectory data firstly, and then the massive passenger points are sliced and clustered cyclically. In the clustering process, the cluster centers can be extracted based on maximum density, and finally the clustering results are visualized according to the results. The experimental results show that compared with other popular methods, the proposed method has significant advantages in clustering speed, precision and visualization for large-scale city passenger hotspots. Moreover, it provides important decisions for further urban planning and promotes the traffic efficiency.","authors":["Hao Zheng","Shangbing Gao","Cai Chuangxin","Zhigeng Pan"],"meta":["May 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):9420","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-88822-3"],"references":["321753740_Research_on_the_Parallelization_of_the_DBSCAN_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Spatial_Data_Mining_Based_on_the_Spark_Platform","319854367_HOTSPOTS_DETECTION_FROM_TRAJECTORY_DATA_BASED_ON_SPATIOTEMPORAL_DATA_FIELD_CLUSTERING","313416819_Investigating_Public_Facility_Characteristics_from_a_Spatial_Interaction_Perspective_A_Case_Study_of_Beijing_Hospitals_Using_Taxi_Data","338603699_Point_of_Interest_Recommendation_by_Exploiting_Geographical_Weighted_Center_and_Categorical_Preference","337627089_Iterative_DBSCAN_I-DBSCAN_to_Identify_Aggressive_Driving_Behaviors_within_Unlabeled_Real-World_Driving_Data","326798500_Fast_and_Scalable_Big_Data_Trajectory_Clustering_for_Understanding_Urban_Mobility","325424261_Mining_Trip_Attractive_Areas_Using_Large-Scale_Taxi_Trajectory_Data","322114660_Road2vec_a_Visual_Analysis_Method_of_Urban_Road_with_Taxi_Trajectory_Data","321813841_PAM_clustering_based_taxi_hotspot_detection_for_informed_driving","313584973_Taxi_cab_service_optimization_using_spatio-temporal_implementation_to_hot-spot_analysis_with_taxi_trajectories_a_case_study_in_Seoul_Korea","308500452_Analysis_of_Berlin's_taxi_services_by_exploring_GPS_traces","308449344_When_Taxi_Meets_Bus_Night_Bus_Stop_Planning_over_Large-scale_Traffic_Data","311491254_TaxiRec_recommending_road_clusters_to_taxi_drivers_using_ranking-based_extreme_learning_machines","308810519_Density_Peaks_Clustering_Approach_for_Discovering_Demand_Hot_Spots_in_City-scale_Taxi_Fleet_Dataset","308038702_How_does_taxi_driver_behavior_impact_their_profit_discerning_the_real_driving_from_large_scale_GPS_traces"]}
