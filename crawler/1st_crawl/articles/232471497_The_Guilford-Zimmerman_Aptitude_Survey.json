{"id":"232471497_The_Guilford-Zimmerman_Aptitude_Survey","abstract":"Recent experimental work demonstrated that human abilities fall into a larger variety of separate and distinct traits than was previously supposed. When completed, the Guilford-Zimmerman Aptitude Survey will include tests of approximately 20 primary abilities. At present 7 tests are available which cover abstract intelligence, clerical aptitude, and mechanical aptitude. Reliability, validity, and intercorrelations figures for the 7 tests are given, and also a list of occupations for which it is believed each part of the Aptitude Survey is predictive. 9 references.
