{"id":"348972513_QM7-X_a_comprehensive_dataset_of_quantum-mechanical_properties_spanning_the_chemical_space_of_small_organic_molecules","abstract":"We introduce QM7-X, a comprehensive dataset of 42 physicochemical properties for ≈4.2 million equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures of small organic molecules with up to seven non-hydrogen (C, N, O, S, Cl) atoms. To span this fundamentally important region of chemical compound space (CCS), QM7-X includes an exhaustive sampling of (meta-)stable equilibrium structures-comprised of constitutional/structural isomers and stereoisomers, e.g., enantiomers and diastereomers (including cis-/trans-and conformational isomers)-as well as 100 non-equilibrium structural variations thereof to reach a total of ≈4.2 million molecular structures. Computed at the tightly converged quantum-mechanical PBE0+MBD level of theory, QM7-X contains global (molecular) and local (atom-in-a-molecule) properties ranging from ground state quantities (such as atomization energies and dipole moments) to response quantities (such as polarizability tensors and dispersion coefficients). By providing a systematic, extensive, and tightly-converged dataset of quantum-mechanically computed physicochemical properties, we expect that QM7-X will play a critical role in the development of next-generation machine-learning based models for exploring greater swaths of CCS and performing in silico design of molecules with targeted properties.","authors":["Johannes Hoja","Leonardo Rafael Medrano Sandonas","Brian Ernst","Alvaro Vazquez-Mayagoitia"],"meta":["February 2021Scientific Data 8(43)","DOI:10.1038/s41597-021-00812-2"],"references":["341087731_The_ANI-1ccx_and_ANI-1x_data_sets_coupled-cluster_and_density_functional_theory_properties_for_molecules","340104634_DFTB_a_software_package_for_efficient_approximate_density_functional_theory_based_atomistic_simulations","335238513_Quantum_mechanical_static_dipole_polarizabilities_in_the_QM7b_and_AlphaML_showcase_databases","325349176_Efficient_nonparametric_n-body_force_fields_from_machine_learning","353614662_Merck_molecular_force_field_III_Molecular_geometries_and_vibrational_frequencies_for_MMFF94","353606157_Merck_molecular_force_field_II_MMFF94_van_der_Waals_and_electrostatic_parameters_for_intermolecular_interactions","343342511_Accurate_Many-Body_Repulsive_Potentials_for_Density-Functional_Tight-Binding_from_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Networks","342126478_Exploring_chemical_compound_space_with_quantum-based_machine_learning","339373899_Approaches_for_machine_learning_intermolecular_interaction_energies_and_application_to_energy_components_from_symmetry_adapted_perturbation_theory","331082268_Operators_in_quantum_machine_learning_Response_properties_in_chemical_space"]}
