We carried out a bibliographic analysis of the international Scopus database in order to describe the status of research work in, on, and around education. We established a global map â€“ mainly in the English speaking world- consisting of eighteen distinct clusters connected together by sets of bibliographic resources. These clusters differ in their shared references and in the aspect of educational research that they focus on. Some clusters share references whose publications are highly connected and deal directly with teaching and learning (e.g., the Learning cluster), while other clusters share references in a less connected way and deal with cross-topics between education and other fields of inquiry (e.g. the Sociology of Education cluster).","authors":["Kristine Lund","Heisawn Jeong","Sebastian Grauwin","Pablo Jensen"],"meta":["October 2017Les Sciences de l'education pour l'ere nouvelle 50(1)","DOI:10.3917/lsdle.501.0067"],"references":["291870921_Bibliographic_coupling_between_scientific_articles"]}
