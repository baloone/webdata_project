{"id":"260735137_Systems_modeling_analysis_and_control_SMAC_toolbox_An_insight_into_the_robustness_analysis_library","abstract":"The analysis library of the new SMAC Toolbox for Matlab implements a set of μ-analysis based tools to evaluate the robustness properties of linear time-invariant systems affected by time-invariant uncertainties. These tools allow to compute both lower and upper bounds on the (skewed) robust stability margin, the worst-case H∞ performance level, as well as the worst-case gain, phase, modulus and time-delay margins. The key idea is to solve the problem on just a coarse frequency grid and to perform a fast validation on the whole frequency range, which results in guaranteed but conservative bounds on the aforementioned quantities. Some heuristics are then applied to determine a set of worst-case parametric configurations leading to over-optimistic bounds. A branch and bound scheme is finally implemented, so as to tighten these bounds with the desired accuracy, while still guaranteeing a reasonable computational complexity.","authors":["Clément Roos"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1109/CACSD.2013.6663479","Conference: Computer Aided Control System Design (CACSD), 2013 IEEE Conference on"],"references":["254054578_Robust_stability_of_time-delay_systems_with_structured_uncertainties_A_m-analysis_based_algorithm","252052107_A_set_of_m-analysis_based_tools_to_evaluate_the_robustness_properties_of_high-dimensional_uncertain_systems","224390996_Computational_Complexity_of_Calculation","4124384_A_Skew_Mu_Toolbox_SMT_for_robustness_analysis","271526965_User_Manual_of_the_Linear_Fractional_Representation_Toolbox_Version_20","265425612_A_Practical_Approach_to_Robustness_Analysis_with_Aeronautical_Applications","256430385_A_Measure_of_Worst-Case_HPerformance_and_of_Largest_Acceptable_Uncertainty","245217906_Computation_of_the_Robustness_Margin_with_the_Skewed_m_Tool","245158246_Reliable_computation_of_the_robustness_margin_for_a_flexible_aircraft","239029970_Analysis_of_Feedback_Systems_with_Structured_Uncertainty","229713183_Computing_bounds_for_the_mixed_m_problem","227687895_Robustness_analysis_of_flexible_structures_Practical_algorithms","225075788_Robust_and_Optimal_Control","224239064_Robustness_analysis_using_the_n_tool","224186102_A_practical_approach_to_worst-case_H_performance_computation","224162039_Efficient_computation_of_a_guaranteed_stability_domain_for_a_high-order_parameter_dependent_plant","220157150_A_Gain-Based_Lower_Bound_Algorithm_for_Real_and_Mixed_m_Problems","3869770_Results_on_worst-case_performance_assessment","3022713_A_lower_bound_for_the_mixed_m_problem"]}
