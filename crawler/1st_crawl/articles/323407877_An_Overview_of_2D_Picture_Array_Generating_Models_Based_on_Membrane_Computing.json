{"id":"323407877_An_Overview_of_2D_Picture_Array_Generating_Models_Based_on_Membrane_Computing","abstract":"A variety of two-dimensional array grammar models generating picture array languages have been introduced and investigated, utilizing and extending the well-established notions and techniques of formal string language theory. On the other hand the versatile computing model with a generic name of P system in the area of membrane computing, has turned out to be a rich framework for different kinds of problems in a variety of fields. Picture array generation in the field of two-dimensional (2D) languages is one such area where P systems with array objects and array rewriting, referred to as array P systems, have been fruitfully employed in increasing the generating power of the 2D grammar models. A variety of array P systems have been proposed in the literature. The objective of this survey is to review and describe the salient features of the major types of array P systems, which have served as the basis for developing other kinds of array P systems. Applications of these array P systems are also briefly described besides indicating possible new directions of investigation.","authors":["K G Subramanian","Sastha Sriram","Bosheng Song","Linqiang Pan"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-73216-9_16","In book: Reversibility and Universality (pp.333-356)"],"references":["301829217_On_Languages_Generated_by_Cell-Like_Spiking_Neural_P_Systems","300333950_A_Membrane_Computing_Model_for_Generation_of_Picture_Arrays","289164565_Parallel_Array-rewriting_P_Systems","344548880_Formal_Models_Languages_and_Applications","313804676_Rewriting_P_Systems_with_Flat-Splicing_Rules","313804654_Array-Rewriting_P_Systems_with_Basic_Puzzle_Grammar_Rules_and_Permitting_Features","312774526_On_Parallel_Array_P_Systems","300779620_P_Systems_with_Parallel_Rewriting_for_Chain_Code_Picture_Languages","286910524_Picture_languages_-_a_survey","284583822_CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY_OF_TWO-DIMENSIONAL_REGULAR_ARRAY_GRAMMARS","271922668_Contextual_array_grammars_and_array_P_systems","283682945_Chomsky_Hierarchy_Control_on_Isotonic_Array_P_Systems","283597293_Control_Languages_Associated_with_Spiking_Neural_P_Systems","283006210_On_string_languages_generated_by_sequential_spiking_neural_P_systems_based_on_the_number_of_spikes","271002917_On_languages_generated_by_spiking_neural_P_systems_with_weights"]}
