{"id":"220284943_VDB-MR_MapReduce-based_distributed_data_integration_using_virtual_database","abstract":"Data Integration is becoming very important in many commercial applications and scientific research. A lot of algorithms and systems have been proposed and developed to address related issues from different aspects. Virtual database systems are well-recognized as one of the effective solutions of data integration. The existing execution modules in virtual database systems are very ineffective. MapReduce (MR) is a new computing model for parallel processing and has a good performance on large-scale data execution. In this paper, we propose a new distributed data integration system, called VDB-MR, which is based on the MapReduce technology, to efficiently integrate data from heterogeneous data sources. With VDB-MR, a unified view (i.e., a single virtual database) of multiple databases can be provided to users. We also conducted a series of experiments to evaluate VDB-MR by comparing it with an open source data integration system OGSA-DAI and two DBMSs in parallel. Experiment results show that VDB-MR significantly outperforms OGSA-DAI and the DBMSs in parallel.","authors":["Yulai Yuan","Yongwei Wu","Xiao Feng","Jing Li"],"meta":["October 2010Future Generation Computer Systems 26(8):1418-1425","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2010.04.001","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228882346_Database_access_and_integration_services_on_the_Grid","220910159_Dynamo_Amazon's_highly_available_key-value_store","3301153_Multimedia_Object_Placement_for_Transparent_Data_Replication","2493278_Supporting_Pervasive_Business_via_Virtual_Database_Aggregation","288915084_Measures_of_reproductive_estimates_in_rural_buffalo_herds_of_Meerut_district_of_Uttar_Pradesh_India","262356588_Google's_MapReduce_programming_model_-_Revisited","232614914_VDM_Virtual_Database_Management_for_Distributed_Databases_and_File_Systems","223008200_Virtual_database_Spatial_analysis_in_a_Web-based_data_management_system_for_distributed_ecological_data","222837781_A_service-oriented_system_for_distributed_data_querying_and_integration_on_Grids","221548986_Autoplex_Automated_Discovery_of_Content_for_Virtual_Databases","221394508_The_TSIMMIS_Project_Integration_of_heterogeneous_information_sources","221213823_Implementation_Techniques_for_Main_Memory_Database_Systems","221213021_DIRECT_A_query_facility_for_multiple_databases","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220566391_SQL_language_summary","220566028_Interoperability_of_Multiple_Autonomous_Databases","220538346_HadoopDB_An_Architectural_Hybrid_of_MapReduce_and_DBMS_Technologies_for_Analytical_Workloads","220415630_Virtual_Database_Technology","220283284_Virtual_Database_technology_XML_and_the_Evolution_of_the_Web","220040448_Multidatabase_Interoperability","24435931_Integrating_Open_Grid_Services_Architecture_Data_Access_and_Integration_with_computational_Grid_workflows","15543609_BibleCard_network-based_virtual_database_for_laboratory_information","11391139_Heterogeneous_Database_Integration_in_Biomedicine","3735046_Virtual_database_technology","3556878_Multidatabase_query_optimization_issues_and_solutions","2646777_The_TSIMMIS_Project_integration_of_heterogeneous_information_sources"]}
