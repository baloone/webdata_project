{"id":"341740148_Welcome_to_JPhys_Complexity","abstract":"JPhys Complexity is a new open access journal reporting high-quality quantitative research in complexity. Complexity pervades natural and man-made systems including the brain, the climate, society and the economy; and requires a highly interdisciplinary approach at the frontiers between physics, mathematics, computer science, biology, economics and the social sciences. JPhys Complexity will showcase exciting new research in this cutting-edge field and provide a platform for research favouring the exchange of knowledge between different disciplines.","authors":["Ginestra Bianconi"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Physics Complexity 1(1):010201","DOI:10.1088/2632-072X/ab92fc"],"references":["341751152_Reconstructing_irreducible_links_in_temporal_networks_Which_tool_to_choose_depends_on_the_network_size","341743450_No-boarding_buses_agents_allowed_to_cooperate_or_defect","341740548_Digraphs_are_different_why_directionality_matters_in_complex_systems","341740149_Preserved_layout_features_embedded_in_road_network_development","341740101_Network-based_ranking_in_social_systems_three_challenges","341739192_Simplicial_complexes_higher-order_spectral_dimension_and_dynamics","215929641_More_Is_Different"]}
