{"id":"321325762_Analysis_and_exploration_for_new_generation_debuggers","abstract":"Locating and fixing bugs is well-known to be a time consuming task. Advanced approaches such as object-centric or back-in-time debuggers have been proposed in the literature. still in many scenarios developers are left alone with generic tools such as manual breakpoints and execution stepping that, while usable, cannot adapt to specific debugging scenarios to make the life of developers easier. In this position paper we explore several advanced on-line debugging techniques such as contextual breakpoints and on-line execution comparison, that could help developers solve complex debugging scenarios. We analyse the open research challenges these techniques pose, as well as the underlying mechanisms they require. We present early but promising prototypes we built using the Pharo programming language. We finally identify future research paths by analysing existing research and connecting it to the techniques we presented before.","authors":["Thomas Dupriez","Guillermo Polito","St√©phane Ducasse"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1145/3139903.3139910","Conference: the 12th edition of the International Workshop"],"references":["254041570_Object-centric_debugging","221496601_Dynamic_Query-Based_Debugging","221496480_Practical_Object-Oriented_Back-in-Time_Debugging","221321481_Call_Graph_Construction_in_Object-Oriented_Languages","220878654_Flow-Centric_Back-in-Time_Debugging","48907864_Sub-method_Structural_and_Behavioral_Reflection","2440118_Evaluating_Message_Passing_Control_Techniques_in_Smalltalk","344939878_Chapter_6_Scientific_Debugging","315749885_Transition_Watchpoints_Teaching_Old_Debuggers_New_Tricks","309443541_Pillar_A_Versatile_and_Extensible_Lightweight_Markup_Language","284575217_The_Moldable_Debugger_A_Framework_for_Developing_Domain-Specific_Debuggers","283750883_Practical_domain-specific_debuggers_using_the_Moldable_Debugger_framework","221560415_Stateful_breakpoints_A_practical_approach_to_defining_parameterized_runtime_monitors","221322063_Using_events_to_debug_Java_programs_backwards_in_time","220691048_Why_Programs_Fail_A_Guide_to_Systematic_Debugging","2480135_Isolating_Cause-Effect_Chains_from_Computer_Programs"]}
