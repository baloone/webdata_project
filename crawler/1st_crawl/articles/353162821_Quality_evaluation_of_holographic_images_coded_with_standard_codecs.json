{"id":"353162821_Quality_evaluation_of_holographic_images_coded_with_standard_codecs","abstract":"Recently, more interest in the different plenoptic formats, including digital holograms, has emerged. Aside from other challenges that several steps of the holographic pipeline, from digital acquisition to display, have to face, visual quality assessment of compressed holograms is particularly demanding due to the distinct nature of this 3D image modality when compared to regular 2D imaging. There are few studies on holographic data quality assessment, particularly with respect to the perceptual effects of lossy compression. This work aims to study the quality evaluation of digital hologram reconstructions presented on regular 2D displays in the presence of compression distortions. As there is no established or generally agreed on compression methodology for digital hologram compression on the hologram plane with available implementations, a set of state-of-the-art compression codecs, namely, HEVC, AV1, and JPEG2000, were used for compression of the digital holograms on the object plane. Both computer-generated and optically generated holograms were considered. Two subjective tests were conducted to evaluate distortions caused by compression. The first subjective test was conducted on the reconstructed amplitude images of central views, while the second test was conducted on pseudovideos generated from the reconstructed amplitudes of different views. The subjective quality assessment was based on mean opinion scores. A selection of objective quality metrics was evaluated, and their correlations with mean opinion scores were computed. The VIFp metrics appeared to have the highest correlation.","authors":["Hadi Amirpourazarian","Antonio M G Pinheiro","Elsa Fonseca","Mohammed Ghanbari"],"meta":["July 2021IEEE Transactions on Multimedia PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMM.2021.3096059"],"references":[]}
