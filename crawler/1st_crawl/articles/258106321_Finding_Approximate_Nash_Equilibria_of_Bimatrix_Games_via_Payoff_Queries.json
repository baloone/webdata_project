{"id":"258106321_Finding_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","abstract":"We show several results concerning finding approximate Nash equilibria in $k\n\\times k$ bimatrix games via payoff queries. For approximate Nash equilibria,\nwe give a randomized algorithm for finding a $(\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} +\n\\epsilon)$-Nash equilibrium using $O(\\frac{k \\cdot \\log k}{\\epsilon^2})$ payoff\nqueries. For well-supported Nash equilibria (WSNE), we first give a randomized\nalgorithm for finding an $\\epsilon$-WSNE of a zero-sum bimatrix game using\n$O(\\frac{k \\cdot \\log k}{\\epsilon^4})$ payoff queries, and we then use this to\nobtain a randomized algorithm for finding a $(\\frac{2}{3} + \\epsilon)$-WSNE in\na general bimatrix game using $O(\\frac{k \\cdot \\log k}{\\epsilon^4})$ payoff\nqueries. We also show two lower bounds for finding well-supported Nash\nequilibria in bimatrix games. We show that finding an $\\epsilon$-WSNE requires\n$k - 1$ payoff queries for any $\\epsilon < 1$, even in win-lose games. Then we\nshow that finding a $\\frac{1}{3k}$-WNSE requires $\\Omega(k^2)$ payoff queries,\neven in win-lose constant-sum games.","authors":["John Fearnley","Rahul Savani"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1145/2600057.2602847","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266658384_Bounds_for_the_query_complexity_of_approximate_equilibria","257142896_Polylogarithmic_Supports_Are_Required_for_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_below_23","235509448_Learning_Equilibria_of_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","225754383_Well_Supported_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","220853479_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220853326_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games","220465612_An_Optimization_Approach_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","220152526_Polynomial_algorithms_for_approximating_Nash_equilibria_of_bimatrix_games","200033999_Progress_in_approximate_nash_equilibria","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","243458309_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria","226347977_Polynomial_Algorithms_for_Approximating_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games","222871046_On_sparse_approximations_to_randomized_strategies_and_convex_combinations","222101118_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_Below_Two-Thirds","222069855_A_note_on_approximate_Nash_equilibria","221606716_Methods_for_Empirical_Game-Theoretic_Analysis","221444972_Approximating_Nash_equilibria_using_small-support_strategies","41386442_New_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","2862728_Playing_Large_Games_using_Simple_Strategies","2418414_On_Sparse_Approximations_To_Randomized_Strategies_And_Convex_Combinations","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
