{"id":"320427919_A_Correlative_Approach_to_Capture_and_Quantify_Substructures_by_Means_of_Image_Registration","abstract":"The quantification of microstructures is crucial for the development of new materials as well as for the quality assurance. The progress in material science is accompanied by more and more complex and fine microstructures. With this, the quantification of these microstructures is becoming increasingly challenging. One way to get more information from microstructures is by combining images made with different imaging techniques, like scanning electron microscopy and light optical microscopy. Despite a wide variety of commercial software, these different images can still not be combined without a considerable proportion of manual work. In this work, we present a workflow to combine micrographs of different imaging sources by means of image registration with the open source tool Fiji and describe how to extract and analyse single grains concerning their substructure with Matlab © on the example of a martensitic dual phase steel.","authors":["D.
