{"id":"293009282_Efficient_R-Tree_Based_Indexing_Scheme_for_Server-Centric_Cloud_Storage_System","abstract":"Cloud storage system poses new challenges to the community to support efficient concurrent querying tasks for various data-intensive applications, where indices always hold important positions. In this paper, we explore a practical method to construct a two-layer indexing scheme for multi-dimensional data in diverse server-centric cloud storage system. We first propose RT-HCN, an indexing scheme integrating R-tree based indexing structure and HCN-based routing protocol. RT-HCN organizes storage and compute nodes into an HCN overlay, one of the newly proposed sever-centric data center topologies. Based on the properties of HCN, we design a specific index mapping technique to maintain layered global indices and corresponding query processing algorithms to support efficient query tasks. Then, we expand the idea of RT-HCN onto another server-centric data center topology DCell, discovering a potential generalized and feasible way of deploying two-layer indexing schemes on other server-centric networks. Furthermore, we prove theoretically that RT-HCN is both space-efficient and query-efficient, by which each node actually maintains a tolerable number of global indices while high concurrent queries can be processed within accepted overhead. We finally conduct targeted experiments on Amazon's EC2 platforms, comparing our design with RT-CAN, a similar indexing scheme for traditional P2P network. The results validate the query efficiency, especially the speedup of point query of RT-HCN, depicting its potential applicability in future data centers.","authors":["Yang Hong","Qiwei Tang","Xiaofeng Gao","Bin Yao"],"meta":["June 2016IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 28(6):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2526006"],"references":["262281876_Aspen_trees_Balancing_data_center_fault_tolerance_scalability_and_cost","260585525_Expandable_and_Cost-Effective_Network_Structures_for_Data_Centers_Using_Dual-Port_Servers","234828564_VL2_A_scalable_and_flexible_data_center_network","234805283_VL2_A_Scalable_and_Flexible_Data_Center_Network","224500462_FiConn_Using_Backup_Port_for_Server_Interconnection_in_Data_Centers","221325404_MDCube_a_high_performance_network_structure_for_modular_data_center_interconnection","221244824_Theory_and_Network_Applications_of_Dynamic_Bloom_Filters","221242026_BCN_Expansible_network_structures_for_data_centers_using_hierarchical_compound_graphs","221212985_Paths_to_stardom_Calibrating_the_potential_of_a_peer-based_data_management_system","221092104_DPillar_Scalable_Dual-Port_Server_Interconnection_for_Data_Center_Networks","220851751_Finding_a_Needle_in_Haystack_Facebook's_Photo_Storage","220624179_Cassandra_-_A_Decentralized_Structured_Storage_System","220538817_A_Framework_for_Supporting_DBMS-like_Indexes_in_the_Cloud","220538410_Efficient_B-tree_Based_Indexing_for_Cloud_Data_Processing","220465609_Survey_Network_Applications_of_Bloom_Filters_A_Survey","220429211_Scalable_and_Cost-Effective_Interconnection_of_Data-Center_Servers_Using_Dual_Server_Ports","220072272_Clustering_Uncertain_Data_Using_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_R-Tree_Index","2539494_Network_Applications_of_Bloom_Filters_A_Survey","2450636_Indexing_the_Positions_of_Continuously_Moving_Objects","313708771_The_R-tree_An_efficient_and_robust_access_method_for_points_and_rectangles","313038610_A_scalable_commodity_data_center_network_architecture","312917980_The_Google_file_system","309108808_Finding_a_needle_in_haystack_Facebookars_photo_storage","308846853_FT-INDEX_A_distributed_indexing_scheme_for_switch-centric_cloud_storage_system","304408251_Design_and_optimization_for_distributed_indexing_scheme_in_switch-centric_cloud_storage_system","278639526_Dynamo","278412054_Dcell","277679300_Towards_a_Painless_Index_for_Spatial_Objects","271417881_On_the_design_and_analysis_of_Data_Center_Network_architectures_for_interconnecting_dual-port_servers","269483998_Snowflake_A_New-Type_Network_Structure_of_Data_Center","262363395_Spanner_Google's_Globally_Distributed_Database","260329380_A_MapReduce-supported_network_structure_for_data_centers","257582265_DPillar_Dual-port_server_interconnection_network_for_large_scale_data_centers","257457497_Spatial_query_processing_for_fuzzy_objects","239545688_R-treesa_dynamic_index_for_spatial_searching","221310753_BATON_A_balanced_tree_structure_for_peer-to-peer_networks","221213065_Indexing_Multi-dimensional_Data_in_a_Cloud_System","221164412_A_scalable_commodity_data_center_network_architecture","220988133_Megastore_Providing_Scalable_Highly_Available_Storage_for_Interactive_Services","220977971_Building_mega_data_center_from_heterogeneous_containers","220910111_The_Google_File_System","220283230_An_Indexing_Framework_for_Efficient_Retrieval_on_the_Cloud","33030362_The_R-Tree_An_Efficient_and_Robust_Access_Method_for_Points_and_Rectangles","2888765_A_Scalable_Content-Addressable_Network"]}
