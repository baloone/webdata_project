{"id":"341847295_Progressive_System_A_Deep-Learning_Framework_for_Real-Time_Data_in_Industrial_Production","abstract":"Deep learning based on a large number of high-quality data plays an important role in many industries. However, deep learning is hard to directly embed in the real-time system, because the data accumulation of the system depends on real-time acquisitions. However, the analysis tasks of such systems need to be carried out in real time, which makes it impossible to complete the analysis tasks by accumulating data for a long time. In order to solve the problems of high-quality data accumulation, high timeliness of the data analysis, and difficulty in embedding deep-learning algorithms directly in real-time systems, this paper proposes a new progressive deep-learning framework and conducts experiments on image recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective and performs well and can reach a conclusion similar to the deep-learning framework based on large-scale data.","authors":["Yifeng Liu","Wei Zhang","Wenhao Du"],"meta":["May 2020Processes 8(6):649","DOI:10.3390/pr8060649"],"references":["258391331_Differential_and_Statistical_Approach_to_Partial_Model_Matching","220860992_Best_Practices_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Visual_Document_Analysis","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","297680357_A_cost-efficient_architecture_for_the_campus_information_system_based_on_transparent_computing_platform","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","257435908_3D_image_retrieval_based_on_differential_geometry_and_co-occurrence_matrix","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","2762849_Solving_Ill-Conditioned_And_Singular_Linear_Systems_A_Tutorial_On_Regularization"]}
