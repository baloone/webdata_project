{"id":"237128841_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Reactive_and_Concurrent_Systems_Safety","abstract":"Reactive systems are computing systems which are interactive, such as real-time systems, operating systems, concurrent systems and control systems. These are among the most difficult computing systems to program. Temporal logic is a formal tool/language which yields excellent results in specifying reactive systems, and this volume (the first of two), offers an introduction to temporal logic and to the computational model for reactive programs which has been developed by the authors.","authors":["Zohar Manna","Amir Pnueli"],"meta":["January 1992","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4612-0931-7","ISBN: 978-1-4612-6950-2"],"references":[]}
