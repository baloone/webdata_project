{"id":"329829390_The_Minimum_Latency_Problem_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the minimum latency problem (MLP). The problem is a variation of the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP) in which sum of arrival times at the nodes is minimized. The problem arises in many real-life applications such as logistics for relief supply, scheduling and data retrieval in computer networks. The computational results on TSPLIB instances show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Finally, a comparative study is carried out against an existing state-of-art algorithm to establish the goodness of our algorithm. The study shows the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid algorithm.","authors":["Zakir Hussain Ahmed"],"meta":["November 2018"],"references":["274310248_An_Improved_Genetic_Algorithm_using_Adaptive_Mutation_Operator_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","274310229_A_Simple_Genetic_Algorithm_using_Sequential_Constructive_Crossover_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","262237452_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Bottleneck_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","261375073_The_Ordered_Clustered_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm","257885945_An_experimental_study_of_a_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_for_the_maximum_traveling_salesman_problem","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","243686554_Optimization_for_Engineering_Design_Algorithms_and_Examples","229547398_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Cumulative_Costs","229517184_Time-Dependent_Traveling_Salesman_Problem-The_Deliveryman_Case"]}
