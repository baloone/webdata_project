{"id":"227312702_Combining_rough_decisions_for_intelligent_text_mining_using_Dempster's_rule","abstract":"An important issue in text mining is how to make use of multiple pieces knowledge discovered to improve future decisions.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach to combining multiple sets of rules for text categorization using Dempster’s rule\nof combination. We develop a boosting-like technique for generating multiple sets of rules based on rough set theory and model\nclassification decisions from multiple sets of rules as pieces of evidence which can be combined by Dempster’s rule of combination.\nWe apply these methods to 10 of the 20-newsgroups—a benchmark data collection (Baker and McCallum 1998), individually and\nin combination. Our experimental results show that the performance of the best combination of the multiple sets of rules on\nthe 10 groups of the benchmark data is statistically significant and better than that of the best single set of rules. The\ncomparative analysis between the Dempster–Shafer and the majority voting (MV) methods along with an overfitting study confirm\nthe advantage and the robustness of our approach.","authors":["Yaxin Bi","Sally Ida McClean","Terry Anderson"],"meta":["January 2006Artificial Intelligence Review 26(3):191-209","DOI:10.1007/s10462-007-9049-y","SourceDBLP"],"references":["313484584_On_combining_classifiers","249749473_Combining_classiers_Soft_computing_solutions","313151120_Methods_of_combining_multiple_classifiers_and_their_application_to_handwriting_recognition","294691750_From_Rough_Sets_Theory_to_Evidence_Theory_Advances_in_the_Dempster-Shafer_Theory_of_Evidence","290882608_Semantic_Information_Retrieval","247990349_The_rough_set_theory_and_evidence_theory","244498683_Experiment_With_a_New_Boosting_Algorithm","243686015_LERS-A_System_for_Learning_from_Examples_Based_on_Rough_Sets","243134514_BoosTexter_A_Boosting-based_System_for_Text_Categorization","242565137_Computer_systems_that_learn_classification_and_prediction_methods_from_statistics"]}
