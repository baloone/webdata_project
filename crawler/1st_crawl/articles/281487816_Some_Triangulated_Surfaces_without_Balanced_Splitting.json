{"id":"281487816_Some_Triangulated_Surfaces_without_Balanced_Splitting","abstract":"Let G be the graph of a triangulated surface $\\Sigma$ of genus $g\\geq 2$. A\ncycle of G is splitting if it cuts $\\Sigma$ into two components, neither of\nwhich is homeomorphic to a disk. A splitting cycle has type k if the\ncorresponding components have genera k and g-k. It was conjectured that G\ncontains a splitting cycle (Barnette '1982). We confirm this conjecture for an\ninfinite family of triangulations by complete graphs but give counter-examples\nto a stronger conjecture (Mohar and Thomassen '2001) claiming that G should\ncontain splitting cycles of every possible type.","authors":["Vincent Despr√©","Francis Lazarus"],"meta":["November 2016Graphs and Combinatorics 32(6)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-016-1735-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["229701514_Note_on_irreducible_triangulations_of_surfaces","316805509_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","268246627_Map_Color_Theorem","265372265_Topological_graph_theory_Reprint_of_the_1987_orig","248851962_Separating_cycles_in_triangulations_of_the_double_torus","238680661_Classical_Topology_Combinatorial_Group_Theory","230322393_On_the_orientable_genus_of_graphs_embedded_in_the_klein_bottle","229751872_Some_problems_in_topological_graph_theory","227622249_On_the_number_of_triangular_embeddings_of_complete_graphs_and_complete_tripartite_graphs","227620125_Triangular_embeddings_of_complete_graphs_neighborly_maps_with_12_and_13_vertices","226316734_All_2-manifolds_have_finitely_many_minimal_triangulations","225463200_Separating_Cycles_in_Doubly_Toroidal_Embeddings","222516091_Splitting_Complicated_Surfaces_is_Hard","222395588_Irreducible_triangulations_are_small","221569482_On_nonnull_separating_circuits_in_embedded_graphs"]}
