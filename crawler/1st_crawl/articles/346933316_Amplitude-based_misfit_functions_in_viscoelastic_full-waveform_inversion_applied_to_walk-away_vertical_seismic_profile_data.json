{"id":"346933316_Amplitude-based_misfit_functions_in_viscoelastic_full-waveform_inversion_applied_to_walk-away_vertical_seismic_profile_data","abstract":"Viscoelastic full-waveform inversion is applied to walk-away vertical seismic profile data acquired at a producing heavy-oil field in Western Canada for the determination of subsurface velocity models (P-wave velocity [Formula: see text] and S-wave velocity [Formula: see text]) and attenuation models (P-wave quality factor [Formula: see text] and S-wave quality factor [Formula: see text]). To mitigate strong velocity-attenuation trade-offs, a two-stage approach is adopted. In Stage I, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] models are first inverted using a standard waveform-difference (WD) misfit function. Following this, in Stage II, different amplitude-based misfit functions are used to estimate the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] models. Compared to the traditional WD misfit function, the amplitude-based misfit functions exhibit stronger sensitivity to attenuation anomalies and appear to be able to invert [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] models more reliably in the presence of velocity errors. Overall, the root-mean-square amplitude-ratio and spectral amplitude-ratio misfit functions outperform other misfit function choices. In the final outputs of our inversion, significant drops in the [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] ratio (~1.6) and Poisson’s ratio (~0.23) are apparent within the Clearwater Formation (depth ~0.45–0.50 km) of the Mannville Group in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Strong [Formula: see text] (~20) and [Formula: see text] (~15) anomalies are also evident in this zone. These observations provide information to help identify the target attenuative reservoir saturated with heavy-oil resources.","authors":["Wenyong Pan","Kristopher A.
