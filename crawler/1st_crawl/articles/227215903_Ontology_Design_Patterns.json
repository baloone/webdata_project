{"id":"227215903_Ontology_Design_Patterns","abstract":"Computational ontologies in the context of information systems are artifacts that encode a description of some world, for\nsome purpose. Under the assumption that there exist classes of problems that can be solved by applying common solutions (as\nit has been experienced in software engineering), we envision small, task-oriented ontologies with explicit documentation\nof design rationales. In this chapter, we describe components called Ontology Design Patterns (OP), and methods that support\npattern-based ontology design.\n\nWe present a typology of OPs, and then focus on Content Ontology Design Patterns in terms of their background, definition,\ncommunication means, related work beyond ontology engineering, exemplification, creation, and usage principles. At the time\nof chapterâ€™s final version, recently performed experiments of patternbased ontology design show remarkable quality improvement\nwithin some sample ontology design projects, specially in terms of compliance to tasks expressed as competency questions or\nscenarios.","authors":["Aldo Gangemi","Valentina Presutti"],"meta":["May 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_10","In book: Handbook on Ontologies (pp.221-243)","Project: Ontology design patterns"],"references":["243786306_A_Formal_Ontology_Framework_to_Represent_Norm_Dynamics","238771380_D221_Methods_for_Selection_and_Integration_of_Reusable_Components_from_Formal_or_Informal_User_Specifications","319393500_FOAF_Vocabulary_Specification_091","314721753_FONTE_factorizing_ONTology_engineering_complexity","314410623_Ontology_Design_for_Interaction_in_a_Reasonable_Enterprise","289842249_Ontology_design_for_interaction_in_a_reasonable_enterprise","261289043_The_Timeless_Way_of_Building","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","239066624_Defining_Nary_Relations_on_the_Semantic_Web_Use_With_Individuals","238784091_D113_NeOn_Formalisms_for_Modularization_Syntax_Semantics_Algebra"]}
