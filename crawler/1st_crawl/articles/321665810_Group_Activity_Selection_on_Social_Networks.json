{"id":"321665810_Group_Activity_Selection_on_Social_Networks","abstract":"We propose a new variant of the group activity selection problem (GASP), where the agents are placed on a social network and activities can only be assigned to connected subgroups (gGASP). We show that if multiple groups can simultaneously engage in the same activity, finding a stable outcome is easy as long as the network is acyclic. In contrast, if each activity can be assigned to a single group only, finding stable outcomes becomes computationally intractable, even if the underlying network is very simple: the problem of determining whether a given instance of a gGASP admits a Nash stable outcome turns out to be NP-hard when the social network is a path or a star, or if the size of each connected component is bounded by a constant. We then study the parameterized complexity of finding outcomes of gGASP that are Nash stable, individually stable or core stable. For the parameter `number of activities', we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case where the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for cliques (i.e., for standard GASP); similar results hold for individual stability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the number of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for standard GASP and when the social network is a star. For the parameter `number of players', all problems we consider are in XP for arbitrary social networks; on the other hand, we prove W[1]-hardness results with respect to the parameter `number of players' for the case where the social network is a clique.","authors":["Ayumi Igarashi","Robert Bredereck","Dominik Peters","Edith Elkind"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["318829728_Fair_Division_of_a_Graph","301857431_Hedonic_Games_with_Graph-restricted_Communication","262277073_Max_flows_in_Onm_time_or_better","260003471_Group_Activity_Selection_Problem","325675612_Hedonic_games","319195196_Group_Activity_Selection_on_Graphs_Parameterized_Analysis","312709311_Coalitional_Games_on_Sparse_Social_Networks","300540901_Group_Activity_Selection_from_Ordinal_Preferences","288039891_Characteristic_function_games_with_restricted_agent_interactions_Core-stability_and_coalition_structures","260929602_On_core_membership_testing_for_hedonic_coalition_formation_games"]}
