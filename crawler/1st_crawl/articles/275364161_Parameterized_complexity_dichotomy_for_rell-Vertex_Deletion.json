{"id":"275364161_Parameterized_complexity_dichotomy_for_rell-Vertex_Deletion","abstract":"For two integers $r, \\ell \\geq 0$, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is an\n$(r,\\ell)$-graph if $V$ can be partitioned into $r$ independent sets and $\\ell$\ncliques. In the parameterized $(r,\\ell)$-Vertex Deletion problem, given a graph\n$G$ and an integer $k$, one has to decide whether at most $k$ vertices can be\nremoved from $G$ to obtain an $(r,\\ell)$-graph. This problem is NP-hard if\n$r+\\ell \\geq 1$ and encompasses several relevant problems such as Vertex Cover\nand Odd Cycle Transversal. The parameterized complexity of $(r,\\ell)$-Vertex\nDeletion was known for all values of $(r,\\ell)$ except for $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$,\nand $(2,2)$. We prove that each of these three cases is FPT and, furthermore,\nsolvable in single-exponential time, which is asymptotically optimal in terms\nof $k$. We consider as well the version of $(r,\\ell)$-Vertex Deletion where the\nset of vertices to be removed has to induce an independent set, and provide\nalso a parameterized complexity dichotomy for this problem.","authors":["Julien Baste","Luerbio Faria","Sulamita Klein","Ignasi Sau"],"meta":["October 2017Theory of Computing Systems 61(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9716-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262326838_Faster_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_Split_Graphs","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","299256330_Improved_parameterized_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","287680005_Subexponential_parameterized_ODD_CYCLE_TRANSVERSAL_on_planar_graphs","281508198_Partitions_of_graphs_into_one_or_two_independent_sets_and_cliques","275669406_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Deletion_to_rl-graphs","265824090_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_rl-Partization","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","228741795_Simplicity_is_beauty_Improved_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","256720832_Split_Vertex_Deletion_meets_Vertex_Cover_New_fixed-parameter_and_exact_exponential-time_algorithms","223355468_Partitions_of_graphs_into_one_or_two_independent_sets_and_cliques","223295622_Finding_odd_cycle_transversals"]}
