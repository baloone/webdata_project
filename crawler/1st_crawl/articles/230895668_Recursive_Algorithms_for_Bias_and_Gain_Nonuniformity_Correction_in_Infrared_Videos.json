{"id":"230895668_Recursive_Algorithms_for_Bias_and_Gain_Nonuniformity_Correction_in_Infrared_Videos","abstract":"Infrared (IR) focal-plane array (FPA) detectors suffer from fixed-pattern noise (FPN), also known as spatial nonuniformity, which degrades image quality. In fact, FPN remains a serious problem despite recent advances in IRFPA technology. This work proposes new scene-based correction algorithms to continuously compensate for bias and gain nonuniformity in focal-plane array sensors. The proposed schemes use recursive least square (RLS) and affine projection (AP) techniques that jointly compensate for both bias and gain for each image pixel, presenting rapidly convergence and robustness to noise. Experiments with synthetic and real IRFPA videos have shown that the proposed solutions are competitive with the state-of-theart in FPN reduction, while presenting recovered images with higher fidelity.","authors":["Daniel Rodrigues Pipa","Eduardo A.
