{"id":"339726231_A_community_perspective_on_the_concept_of_marine_holobionts_current_status_challenges_and_future_directions","abstract":"This working group gathers 31 scientists from ten different countries, with expertise covering different scientific disciplines including philosophy, evolution, computer sciences, marine biology, ecology, chemistry, and microbiology, who participated in a workshop on marine holobionts, organized at the Roscoff Biological Station in March 2018. Their aim was to exchange ideas regarding key concepts and opportunities in marine holobiont research, to start structuring the community, and to identify and tackle key challenges in the field.","authors":["Simon M Dittami","Enrique Arboleda","Jean-Christophe Auguet","Arite Bigalke"],"meta":["March 2020","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.3696771"],"references":["340126931_Holobiont_Evolution_Mathematical_Model_with_Vertical_vs_Horizontal_Microbiome_Transmission","339007558_Spatial_metabolomics_of_in_situ_host-microbe_interactions_at_the_micrometre_scale","336237289_Using_chemical_language_to_shape_future_marine_health","332980065_Microbial_gardening_by_a_seaweed_holobiont_Surface_metabolites_attract_protective_and_deter_pathogenic_epibacterial_settlement","331468697_Algae_bacteria_interactions_that_balance_the_planktonic_microbiome","330400456_Fueled_by_methane_deep-sea_sponges_from_asphalt_seeps_gain_their_nutrition_from_methane-oxidizing_symbionts","345674121_Microbial_Culturomics_Paradigm_shift_in_the_human_gut_microbiome_study","332660377_Marine_DNA_Viral_Macro-_and_Microdiversity_from_Pole_to_Pole","331420447_Algal_Remodeling_in_a_Ubiquitous_Planktonic_Photosymbiosis","329862678_Citation_Chemically-Mediated_Interactions_Between_Macroalgae_Their_Fungal_Endophytes_and_Protistan_Pathogens"]}
