{"id":"332269412_OSHDB_a_framework_for_spatio-temporal_analysis_of_OpenStreetMap_history_data","abstract":"OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project collecting geographical data of the entire world. The level of detail of OSM data and its data quality vary much across different regions and domains. In order to analyse such variations it is often necessary to research the history and evolution of the OSM data.\nThe OpenStreetMap History Database (OSHDB) is a new data analysis tool for spatio-temporal geographical vector data. It is specifically optimized for working with OSM history data on a global scale and allows one to investigate the data evolution and user contributions in a flexible way. Benefits of the OSHDB are for example: to facilitate accessing OSM history data as a research subject and to assess the quality of OSM data by using intrinsic measures.\nThis article describes the requirements of such a system and the resulting technical implementation of the OSHDB: the OSHDB data model and its application programming interface.","authors":["Martin Raifer","Rafael Troilo","Fabian Kowatsch","Michael Auer"],"meta":["April 2019Open Geospatial Data Software and Standards 4(1):3","DOI:10.1186/s40965-019-0061-3","Projects: Geographic Social Media AnalyticsOpenStreetMap Data Quality Analytics (VGI Big Spatial Data Analytics)AGORA: A Geospatial Open Collaborative Approach for Building Resilience against  Disasters and Extreme EventsA framework for measuring the fitness for purpose of OpenStreetMap data based on intrinsic quality indicators"],"references":["327274124_Linked_Open_Data_Vocabularies_for_Semantically_Annotated_Repositories_of_Data_Quality_Measures","326332634_AN_OPEN_SOURCE_APPROACH_FOR_THE_INTRINSIC_ASSESSMENT_OF_THE_TEMPORAL_ACCURACY_UP-TO-DATENESS_AND_LINEAGE_OF_OPENSTREETMAP","326031747_Improving_the_Quality_of_Citizen_Contributed_Geodata_through_Their_Historical_Contributions_The_Case_of_the_Road_Network_in_OpenStreetMap","325581794_The_Effect_of_Tectonic_Plate_Motion_on_OpenStreetMap_Data","325403543_Open_source_data_mining_infrastructure_for_exploring_and_analysing_OpenStreetMap","325397280_Towards_Using_the_Potential_of_OpenStreetMap_History_for_Disaster_Activation_Monitoring","319880969_The_OpenStreetMap_Folksonomy_and_Its_Evolution","319052118_The_world's_user-generated_road_map_is_more_than_80_complete","316348512_Assessing_OpenStreetMap_Data_Using_Intrinsic_Quality_Indicators_An_Extension_to_the_QGIS_Processing_Toolbox","312775005_MapReduce_Simplified_data_processing_on_large_clusters"]}
