{"id":"281795604_Methodological_Pathways_for_Avoiding_Pitfalls_in_Multivocality","abstract":"This chapter explores multivocality from a methodological perspective. A conceptual model is presented for thinking about multivocality and how it relates to methodological traditions. We reflect back on what we have learned through experimentation with multivocality through the five data sections of the book and draw principles for best practices that we offer to the broader research community. As a running theme throughout the chapter, and as an invitation to disseminate multivocality to the next generation of researchers in our field, we contrast the experience of expert analysts whose work is presented in the preceding data sections with the experience of students working in groups on their first discourse analysis project in the context of a Computational Models of Discourse Analysis (CMDA) class.","authors":["Carolyn Penstein Ros√©","Kristine Lund"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-8960-3_32","ISBN: 978-1-4614-8959-7"],"references":["312694283_Social_Metacognition_Micro-Creativity_and_Justifications_Statistical_Discourse_Analysis_of_a_Mathematics_Classroom_Conversation","312693146_A_Multivocal_Process_Analysis_of_Social_Positioning_in_Study_Groups","289666222_Some_Practices_for_Referring_to_Persons_in_Talk-in-Interaction","281249195_Gaining_Insights_from_Sociolinguistic_Style_Analysis_for_Redesign_of_Conversational_Agent_Based_Support_for_Collaborative_Learning","278759313_Epistemological_Encounters_in_Multivocal_Settings","278692571_Statistical_Discourse_Analysis_of_an_Online_Discussion_Cognition_and_Social_Metacognition","267379067_Successful_Knowledge_Building_Needs_Group_Awareness_Interaction_Analysis_of_a_9th_Grade_CSCL_Biology_Lesson","249712616_Discourse_Pragmatics_Conversation_Analysis","245767291_Confirming_Allusions_Toward_an_Empirical_Account_of_Action","318421480_'Natural'_and_'Contrived'_Data_A_Sustainable_Distinction","312694282_Exploring_Pivotal_Moments_in_Students'_Knowledge_Building_Progress_Using_Participation_and_Discourse_Marker_Indicators_as_Heuristic_Guides","312694086_Focus-Based_Constructive_Interaction","312693145_Group_Scribbles-Supported_Collaborative_Learning_in_a_Primary_Grade_5_Science_Class","312693052_Socio-Dynamic_Latent_Semantic_Learner_Models","312692885_Cascading_Inscriptions_and_Practices_Diagramming_and_Experimentation_in_the_Group_Scribbles_Classroom","312692875_Development_of_Group_Understanding_via_the_Construction_of_Physical_and_Technological_Artifacts","291257176_Critical_Reflections_on_Multivocal_Analysis_and_Implications_for_Design-Based_Research","291246743_Multivocality_in_Interaction_Analysis_Implications_for_Practice","290767457_Interaction_Analysis_of_a_Biology_Chat","283656943_Discourse_in_the_novel","281994559_'Discourse_in_the_Novel'_in_the_Dialogic_Imagination_Four_Essays","281795700_Network_Analytic_Techniques_for_Online_Chat","280710410_Conceptual_Change_and_Sustainable_Coherency_of_Concepts_Across_Modes_of_Interaction","271238480_In_Search_of_a_Good_Death_Observations_of_Patients_Families_and_Providers","262398162_Towards_Academically_Productive_Talk_Supported_by_Conversational_Agents","254088158_'Natural'_and_'contrived'_data_A_sustainable_distinction","249237828_Studying_Compliment_Responses_A_Comparison_of_DCTs_and_Recordings_of_Naturally_Occurring_Talk"]}
