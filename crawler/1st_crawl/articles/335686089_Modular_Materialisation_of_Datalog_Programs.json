{"id":"335686089_Modular_Materialisation_of_Datalog_Programs","abstract":"The seminaïve algorithm can be used to materialise all consequences of a datalog program, and it also forms the basis for algorithms that incrementally update a materialisation as the input facts change. Certain (combinations of) rules, however, can be handled much more efficiently using custom algorithms. To integrate such algorithms into a general reasoning approach that can handle arbitrary rules, we propose a modular framework for computing and maintaining a materialisation. We split a datalog program into modules that can be handled using specialised algorithms, and we handle the remaining rules using the semina¨ıve algorithm. We also present two algorithms for computing the transitive and the symmetric– transitive closure of a relation that can be used within our framework. Finally, we show empirically that our framework can handle arbitrary datalog programs while outperforming existing approaches, often by orders of magnitude.","authors":["Pan Hu","Boris Motik","Ian Horrocks"],"meta":["July 2019Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 33:2859-2866","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33012859"],"references":["303854811_Incremental_Update_of_Datalog_Materialisation_the_BackwardForward_Algorithm","259828897_DBpedia_-_A_Large-scale_Multilingual_Knowledge_Base_Extracted_from_Wikipedia","225035500_Foundations_of_Databases","213883593_Maintaining_views_incrementally","326342457_LUBM_A_Benchmark_for_OWL_Knowledge_Base_Systems","321070122_Optimised_Maintenance_of_Datalog_Materialisations","313680135_Column-Oriented_Datalog_Materialization_for_Large_Knowledge_Graphs","301246816_Inferray_fast_in-memory_RDF_inference","285521183_Maintenance_of_transitive_closure_and_transitive_reduction_of_graphs","251696247_WebPIE_A_Web-scale_Parallel_Inference_Engine_using_MapReduce_vol_10_pg_59_2012","220967163_Implementing_an_Inference_Engine_for_RDFSOWL_Constructs_and_User-Defined_Rules_in_Oracle","220575544_FactForge_A_fast_track_to_the_Web_of_data","220575516_OWLIM_A_family_of_scalable_semantic_repositories","220111554_On-Line_Computation_of_Transitive_Closures_of_Graphs","30408902_SKOS_Simple_Knowledge_Organisation_System","3880920_Fully_dynamic_transitive_closure_Breaking_through_the_On2_barrier","2241831_Incremental_Maintenance_of_Externally_Materialized_Views"]}
