{"id":"317055434_Design_of_Approximate_High-Radix_Dividers_by_Inexact_Binary_Signed-Digit_Addition","abstract":"Approximate high radix dividers (HR-AXDs) are proposed and investigated in this paper. High-radix division is reviewed and inexact computing is introduced at different levels. Design parameters such as number of bits (N) and radix (r) are considered in the analysis; the replacement schemes with inexact cells and truncation schemes of exact cells in the binary signed-digit adder array is introduced. Circuit-level performance and the error characteristics of the inexact high radix dividers are analyzed for the proposed designs. The combined assessment of the normal error distance, power dissipation and delay is investigated and applications of approximate high-radix dividers are treated in detail. The simulation results show that the proposed approximate dividers offer extensive saving in terms of power dissipation, circuit complexity and delay, while only incurring in a small degradation in accuracy thus making them possibly suitable and interesting to some applications and domains such as low power/mobile computing.","authors":["Linbin Chen","Fabrizio Lombardi","Paolo Montuschi","Jie Han"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1145/3060403.3060404","Conference: the"],"references":["3043862_Division_algorithms_and_implementations","3043364_Very-High_Radix_Division_with_Prescaling_and_Selection_by_Rounding","286536261_Digit-Serial_Arithmetic","283283310_On_the_Design_of_Approximate_Restoring_Dividers_for_Error-Tolerant_Applications","260585402_New_Metrics_for_the_Reliability_of_Approximate_and_Probabilistic_Adders","224582879_Signed-Digit_Numbe_Representations_for_Fast_Parallel_Arithmetic","220695630_Computer_arithmetic_-_algorithms_and_hardware_designs","3850724_High-radix_parallel_VLSI_dividers_without_using_quotient_digit_selection_tables","3048962_On-the-Fly_Conversion_of_Redundant_into_Conventional_Representations","3044304_Boosting_very-high_radix_division_with_prescaling_and_selection_by_rounding"]}
