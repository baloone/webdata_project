{"id":"343468637_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Symmetry_2009-2019","abstract":"Symmetry is an international journal in the research fields of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science, theory and methods, and other scientific disciplines and engineering. The first paper was published in 2009. Here, we make a bibliometric analysis of publications in Symmetry from 2009 to 2019. According to Web of Science (WoS), we obtained 3215 publications in this journal. First, we explore the publications, citation number, and citation structure based on bibliometric indicators. Second, we analyze the most influential objects, including countries/regions, institutions, authors, and papers. Cooperation networks are also presented. Next, the co-citation and burst detection analyses are conducted according to the techniques of visualization tools, i.e., VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Furthermore, the co-occurrence analyses and timeline view analyses of keywords are investigated, aiming to explore the research hotspots. Finally, this paper provides relatively thorough perspectives and reviews and discloses the future development trend of this journal and challenges for scholars, which will promote the development of the journal and in-depth research of scholars.","authors":["Bo Li","Zeshui Xu","Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas","Jurgita Antucheviciene"],"meta":["August 2020Symmetry 12(8):1304","DOI:10.3390/sym12081304"],"references":["342451825_The_Knowledge_Domain_of_The_Baltic_Journal_of_Road_and_Bridge_Engineering_Between_2006_and_2019","340167480_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_Economic_Research-Ekonomska_Istrazivanja_2007-2019","337429782_Comprehensive_bibliometric_study_of_Journal_of_Environmental_Engineering_and_Landscape_Management_from_2007_to_2019","337027935_Bibliometric_analysis_of_support_vector_machines_research_trend_a_case_study_in_China","335242342_A_bibliometric_overview_of_the_International_Journal_of_Strategic_Property_Management_between_2008_and_2019","332826078_Bibliometric_analysis_of_the_Journal_of_Civil_Engineering_and_Management_between_2008_and_2018","332685205_The_evolution_of_Technological_and_Economic_Development_of_Economy_a_bibliometric_analysis","329784509_Digital_competences_computer_skills_and_information_literacy_in_secondary_education_mapping_and_visualization_of_trends_and_concepts","324215632_Theme_trends_and_knowledge_structure_on_choroidal_neovascularization_A_quantitative_and_co-word_analysis","328065691_Renewable_energy_source_integration_into_power_networks_research_trends_and_policy_implications_A_bibliometric_and_research_actors_survey_analysis"]}
