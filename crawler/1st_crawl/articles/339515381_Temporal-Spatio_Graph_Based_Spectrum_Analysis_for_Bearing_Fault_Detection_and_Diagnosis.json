{"id":"339515381_Temporal-Spatio_Graph_Based_Spectrum_Analysis_for_Bearing_Fault_Detection_and_Diagnosis","abstract":"This paper suggests the correlation information, hidden in spatial configuration and temporal dynamic of frequencies, is an important indication for bearing health condition. To consider this information, we extend graph-modeling strategy, and introduce a bearing fault detection and diagnosis technique based on temporal-spatio graph. First, short-time periodogram is extracted from vibration signal, and then modeled by a temporal-spatio graph. In fault detection phase, the spectrum of temporal channel graph is used to map short-time periodogram to acquire the so-called graph-mapped spectrum (GMS). The principal frequency in resulting GMS is found highly related with the health condition of monitored bearing. Thus, any change of health condition can be detected by checking this principal frequency over time. Once a fault is detected, the spatio channel graph is fed to K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, coupled with a specific graph distance metric, for fault type identification. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmarking data sets along with theoretical interpretation demonstrate the superiority of proposed method over state-of-the-arts. The proposed temporal-spatio graph provides a signif- icant extension of existing spectrum analysis for fault detection and diagnosis.","authors":["Teng Wang","Zheng Liu","Guoliang Lu","Jie Liu"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIE.2020.2975499"],"references":["320362054_Statistical_Spectral_Analysis_for_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Rotating_Machines","302593826_Automatic_characteristic_frequency_association_and_all-sideband_demodulation_for_the_detection_of_a_bearing_fault","302571013_The_Vibration_Monitoring_Methods_and_Signal_Processing_Techniques_for_Structural_Health_Monitoring_A_Review","291387753_An_Intelligent_Fault_Diagnosis_Method_Using_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_Towards_Mechanical_Big_Data","283339119_Rolling_element_bearing_defect_diagnosis_under_variable_speed_operation_through_angle_synchronous_averaging_of_wavelet_de-noised_estimate","282389149_Application_of_MEMS_Accelerometer_for_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_Multiple_Faults_in_the_Roller_Element_Bearings_of_Three_Phase_Induction_Motor","279213491_An_extensive_review_of_vibration_modelling_of_rolling_element_bearings_with_localised_and_extended_defects","276248554_Rolling_Element_Bearing_Diagnostics_Using_the_Case_Western_Reserve_University_Data_A_Benchmark_Study","274095916_A_review_on_prognostic_techniques_for_non-stationary_and_non-linear_rotating_systems","270742189_Detection_of_Localized_Bearing_Faults_in_Induction_Machines_by_Spectral_Kurtosis_and_Envelope_Analysis_of_Stator_Current","225625329_Web_graph_similarity_for_anomaly_detection","223556476_Wavelet_filter-based_weak_signature_detection_method_and_its_application_on_rolling_element_bearing_prognostics","222655848_An_automated_methodology_for_performing_time_synchronous_averaging_of_a_gearbox_signal_without_speed_sensor","3899400_A_DSP-based_FFT-analyzer_for_the_fault_diagnosis_of_rotating_machine_based_on_vibration_analysis","3219791_Fault_Detection_in_Induction_Machines_Using_Power_Spectral_Density_in_Wavelet_Decomposition","330893862_A_Novel_Statistical_Time-Frequency_Analysis_for_Rotating_Machine_Condition_Monitoring","330185189_An_intelligent_fault_diagnosis_approach_based_on_transfer_learning_from_laboratory_bearings_to_locomotive_bearings","327412322_Graph-Based_Change_Detection_for_Condition_Monitoring_of_Rotating_Machines_Techniques_for_Graph_Similarity","321443531_Machinery_health_prognostics_A_systematic_review_from_data_acquisition_to_RUL_prediction","317624725_Graph-based_structural_change_detection_for_rotating_machinery_monitoring","306285500_A_Spectral_Graph_Theoretic_Approach_for_Monitoring_Multivariate_Time_Series_Data_From_Complex_Dynamical_Processes","291029817_Motor_Bearing_Fault_Detection_Using_Spectral_Kurtosis_Based_Feature_Extraction_and_K-Nearest_Neighbor_Distance_Analysis","276900559_A_Survey_on_Wind_Turbine_Condition_Monitoring_and_Fault_Diagnosis","274514360_A_novel_bearing_fault_diagnosis_model_integrated_permutation_entropy_ensemble_empirical_mode_decomposition_and_optimized_SVM","266853637_Plemmons_RJ_Nonnegative_Matrices_in_the_Mathematical_Sciences_SIAM_Philadelphia_PA","260303852_Semisupervised_Distance-Preserving_Self-Organizing_Map_for_Machine-Defect_Detection_and_Classification","259584418_Motor_Bearing_Fault_Diagnosis_Using_Trace_Ratio_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis","259516591_Wavelet_leaders_multifractal_features_based_fault_diagnosis_of_rotating_mechanism","257177736_Automatic_bearing_fault_diagnosis_based_on_one-class_n-SVM","229335575_The_spectral_kurtosis_Application_to_the_vibratory_surveillance_and_diagnostics_of_rotating_machines","225664653_Life_Information_Theory_and_Topology","224345241_Advances_in_Diagnostic_Techniques_for_Induction_Machines","223708312_Antoni_J_Cyclic_Spectral_Analysis_of_Rolling-Element_Bearing_Signals_Facts_and_Fictions_Journal_of_Sound_and_Vibration_304_497-529","223191876_A_modified_low-speed_balancing_method_for_flexible_rotors_based_on_holospectrum","222940479_Robust_sound_localization_using_conditional_time-frequency_histograms","222595608_Early_detection_of_gear_failure_by_vibration_analysis--ii_interpretation_of_the_time-frequency_distribution_using_image_processing_techniques","221996178_Analysis_of_Complex_Statistical_Variables_into_Principal_Components","221932947_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","3081159_Nearest_neighbor_pattern_classification_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory_IT-13121-27"]}
