{"id":"322841075_Stream_Ciphers_A_Practical_Solution_for_Efficient_Homomorphic-Ciphertext_Compression","abstract":"In typical applications of homomorphic encryption, the first step consists for Alice of encrypting some plaintext m under Bob’s public key \\(\\mathsf {pk}\\) and of sending the ciphertext \\(c = \\mathsf {HE}_{\\mathsf {pk}}(m)\\) to some third-party evaluator Charlie. This paper specifically considers that first step, i.e., the problem of transmitting c as efficiently as possible from Alice to Charlie. As others suggested before, a form of compression is achieved using hybrid encryption. Given a symmetric encryption scheme \\(\\mathsf {E}\\), Alice picks a random key k and sends a much smaller ciphertext \\(c' = (\\mathsf {HE}_{\\mathsf {pk}}(k), \\mathsf {E}_k(m))\\) that Charlie decompresses homomorphically into the original c using a decryption circuit \\(\\mathcal {C}_{{\\mathsf {E}^{-1}}}\\). In this paper, we revisit that paradigm in light of its concrete implementation constraints, in particular \\(\\mathsf {E}\\) is chosen to be an additive IV-based stream cipher. We investigate the performances offered in this context by Trivium, which belongs to the eSTREAM portfolio, and we also propose a variant with 128-bit security: Kreyvium. We show that Trivium, whose security has been firmly established for over a decade, and the new variant Kreyvium has excellent performance. We also describe a second construction, based on exponentiation in binary fields, which is impractical but sets the lowest depth record to \\(8\\) for \\(128\\)-bit security.","authors":["Anne Canteaut","Sergiu Carpov","Caroline Fontaine","Tancrède Lepoint"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Cryptology 31(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00145-017-9273-9","Project: Homomorphic encryption"],"references":["321094753_Boolean_functions_with_restricted_input_and_their_robustness_application_to_the_FLIP_cipher","345661900_Introduction_to_Modern_Cryptography","325097136_Cube_Attacks_on_Non-Blackbox_Polynomials_Based_on_Division_Property","318822999_Degree_Evaluation_of_NFSR-Based_Cryptosystems","318821981_Cube_Attacks_on_Non-Blackbox_Polynomials_Based_on_Division_Property","312833937_Match_Box_Meet-in-the-Middle_Attack_Against_KATAN","312830017_Ciphers_for_MPC_and_FHE","312771359_Bootstrapping_for_HElib","309774041_Faster_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Bootstrapping_in_Less_Than_01_Seconds","309018544_Minimizing_the_Number_of_Bootstrappings_in_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption"]}
