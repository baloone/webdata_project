{"id":"326516264_Predicting_teamwork_group_assessment_using_log_data-based_learning_analytics","abstract":"The application of learning analytics techniques to log data from Learning Management Systems (LMS) has raised increasing interest in the past years. Advances in this field include the selection of adequate indicators and development of research frameworks. However, most research has focused on individual students, which has hampered the development of learning analytics for team assessment in collaborative learning contexts. From a four-dimensional view of teamwork, this study proposes a set of log data-based indicators to facilitate group assessment in project-based learning courses, and identify relevant predictors of final project results.","authors":["Ángel Hernández-García","Emiliano Acquila-Natale","Julián Chaparro-Peláez","Miguel Conde-González"],"meta":["July 2018Computers in Human Behavior 89","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.016","Project: Teamwork Competence Assessment using Learning Analytics"],"references":[]}
