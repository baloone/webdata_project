{"id":"259090840_The_complexity_of_complex_weighted_Boolean_CSP","abstract":"We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for the most general form of Boolean #CSP where every constraint function takes values in the field of complex numbers CC. We first give a non-trivial tractable class of Boolean #CSP which was inspired by holographic reductions. The tractability crucially depends on algebraic cancelations which are absent for non-negative numbers. We then completely characterize all the tractable Boolean #CSP with complex-valued constraints and show that we have found all the tractable ones, and every remaining problem is #P-hard. We also improve our result by proving the same dichotomy theorem holds for Boolean #CSP with maximum degree 3 (every variable appears at most three times). The concept of Congruity and Semi-congruity provides a key insight and plays a decisive role in both the tractability and hardness proofs. We also introduce local holographic reductions as a technique in hardness proofs.","authors":["Jin-Yi Cai","Pinyan Lu","Mingji Xia"],"meta":["February 2014Journal of Computer and System Sciences 80(1):217â€“236","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2013.07.003"],"references":["226999241_On_Counting_Homomorphisms_to_Directed_Acyclic_Graphs","220138790_On_counting_homomorphisms_to_directed_acyclic_graphs","268614150_Complexity_Classifications_of_Boolean_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","265080713_The_complexity_of_counting_graph_homomorphisms_DRAFT_1_April_1999","261468879_A_Dichotomy_for_Real_Weighted_Holant_Problems","226869314_The_Complexity_of_the_Counting_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problem","225402905_From_Holant_to_CSP_and_Back_Dichotomy_for_Holantc_Problems","224871797_A_Complete_Dichotomy_Rises_from_the_Capture_of_Vanishing_Signatures","224678308_Accidental_Algorthims","224354148_Holographic_Algorithms_by_Fibonacci_Gates_and_Holographic_Reductions_for_Hardness","223375742_The_Complexity_of_Partition_Functions","223053040_Complexity_of_Generalized_Satisfiability_Counting_Problems","221590994_On_the_complexity_of_CSP","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","221590705_Holant_problems_and_counting_CSP","221580840_Non-negativelyWeighted_CSP_An_Effective_Complexity_Dichotomy","220618207_The_Complexity_of_Enumeration_and_Reliability_Problems","220617478_Computational_Complexity_of_Holant_Problems","220616837_The_Complexity_of_Counting_in_Sparse_Regular_and_Planar_Graphs","220431974_A_dichotomy_theorem_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems_on_a_3-element_set","220345436_Corrigendum_The_complexity_of_counting_graph_homomorphisms","220247478_Towards_a_dichotomy_theorem_for_the_counting_constraint_satisfaction_problem","220138878_Holographic_Algorithms_From_Art_to_Science","220138740_Holographic_Algorithms","51953153_Complexity_of_Counting_CSP_with_Complex_Weights","50274476_The_Complexity_of_Weighted_Boolean_CSP_Modulo_k","45910323_From_Holant_to_CSP_and_Back_Dichotomy_for_Holant_c_Problems","24167413_Graph_Homomorphisms_with_Complex_Values_A_Dichotomy_Theorem","23678738_The_Complexity_of_Weighted_Boolean_CSP_with_Mixed_Signs","4038194_Towards_a_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_the_Counting_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problem","1919044_A_Complexity_Dichotomy_for_Partition_Functions_with_Mixed_Signs","1888095_The_complexity_of_weighted_Boolean_CSP"]}
