{"id":"314398551_Research_Performance_of_the_Indian_Institutes_of_Technology_IITs","abstract":"This article presents a computational analysis of the research performance of 16 relatively older\nIndian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in India. The research publication data indexed in Web of\nScience for all the 16 IITs is used for the analysis. The data is computationally analysed to identify\nproductivity, productivity per capita, rate of growth of research output, authorship and collaboration\npattern, citation impact and discipline-wise research strengths of the different IITs. The research\nperformances of the IITs have been compared with those of two top ranking engineering and\ntechnology institutions of the world (MIT-USA and NTU-Singapore) and most cited papers from\nthese IITs have also been identified. The analytical results are expected to provide a informative,\nup-to-date and useful account of research performance assessment of the IITs.","authors":["Sumit Kumar Banshal","Vivek Kumar Singh","Aparna Basu","Pranab K.
