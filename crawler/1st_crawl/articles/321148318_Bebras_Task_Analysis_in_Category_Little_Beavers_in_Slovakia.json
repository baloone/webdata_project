{"id":"321148318_Bebras_Task_Analysis_in_Category_Little_Beavers_in_Slovakia","abstract":"In Slovakia, there has been an international Bebras competition (iBobor) since 2007. The first category named Little Beavers (Primary or Bobríci) includes pupils aged between 7 and 10 (2nd - 4th grade of primary school). In this article, we analyse tasks and results from this category collected in years 2012–2017. By qualitative and quantitative research methods, we have created a new categorisation of tasks based on their text analyses in order to better understand some patterns (and correlations) between the tasks and the results. We have created four different categories: Programming oriented tasks, Algorithmic, Logic and Digital Literacy. Using qualitative task analysis, we have also defined several subcategories and, based on analysis of contestants’ results, we have found different grade- and gender-to-performance correlation.","authors":["Lucia Budinska","Karolína Miková","Michaela Veselovská"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-71483-7_8","Conference: International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution, and Perspectives"],"references":["315831218_Developing_a_Two-Dimensional_Categorization_System_for_Educational_Tasks_in_Informatics","308497334_How_to_Attract_the_Girls_Gender-Specific_Performance_and_Motivation_in_the_Bebras_Challenge","303239675_Bebras_-_a_Sustainable_Community_Building_Model_for_the_Concept_Based_Learning_of_Informatics_and_Computational_Thinking","221437671_Bebras_International_Contest_on_Informatics_and_Computer_Literacy_Criteria_for_Good_Tasks","309061291_What_Makes_Situational_Informatics_Tasks_Difficult","290746984_Reasoning_on_Children's_Cognitive_Skills_in_an_Informatics_Contest_Findings_and_Discoveries_from_Finland_Lithuania_and_Sweden","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","267205602_Students'_Attitude_to_Programming_in_Modern_Informatics","224892368_Doing_qualitative_research_a_practical_handbook","221437591_Little_Beaver_-_A_New_Bebras_Contest_Category_for_Children_Aged_8-9","220396214_Information_Technology_Contests_-_Introduction_to_Computer_Science_in_an_Attractive_Way"]}
