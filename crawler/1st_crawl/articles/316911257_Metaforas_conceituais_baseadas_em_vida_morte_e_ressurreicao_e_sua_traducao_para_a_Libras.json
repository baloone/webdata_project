{"id":"316911257_Metaforas_conceituais_baseadas_em_vida_morte_e_ressurreicao_e_sua_traducao_para_a_Libras","abstract":"This research analyzes in which ways the conceptual metaphors based in “life”, “death” and “resurrection”, presents in the John`s Gospel of the Bible in Portuguese language, were translated into Brazilian Sign Language (Libras). Firstly, I do a mapping of the metaphors, and later on I check how the cognitive aspects underlying each one of them are structured, both in the source language as in the translation of them. In this regard, I use the postulates of the Theory of Conceptual Metaphor, designed by Lakoff and Johnson (2003), the postulates of Fauconnier and Turner (2002) about the conceptual blending and the postulates of Kövecses (2005, 2010) about the role of cultures upon their own conceptualizations. In order to explain some phenomena, specifically from translation, such as the new implicit information, I bring some discussion about some views of the Relevance Theory, from Sperber and Wilson (2001), whereby I also check in which ways the translator`s inferences keep or change the conceptual metaphors from a religious sensitive text in the Brazilian deaf culture. As it can be seen, the research upon this thesis connects the Translation Studies and the Cognitive Linguistics, and some of the results propose that the same embodied experience can generate distinct conceptual metaphors in two also distinct cultures. As I am analyzing the translation of the Bible as a sensitive text, some of the results also point to changes in the conceptual metaphors, due to the translation, may cause changes in the chains of significances related to the Christian symbols.","authors":["Emerson Cristian Pereira dos Santos"],"meta":["December 2016","Thesis for: MasterAdvisor: Robert Brose Pires"],"references":[]}
