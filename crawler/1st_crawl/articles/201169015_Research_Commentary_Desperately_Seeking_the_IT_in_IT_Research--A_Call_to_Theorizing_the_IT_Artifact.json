{"id":"201169015_Research_Commentary_Desperately_Seeking_the_IT_in_IT_Research--A_Call_to_Theorizing_the_IT_Artifact","abstract":"The field of information systems is premised on the centrality of\ninformation technology in everyday socio-economic life. Yet, drawing\non a review of the full set of articles published in Information\nSystems Research (ISR) over the past ten years, we argue that the\nfield has not deeply engaged its core subject matterâthe information\ntechnology (IT) artifact. Instead, we find that IS researchers tend\nto give central theoretical significance to the context (within which\nsome usually unspecified technology is seen to operate), the discrete\nprocessing capabilities of the artifact (as separable from its context\nor use), or the dependent variable (that which is posited to be affected\nor changed as technology is developed, implemented, and used). The\nIT artifact itself tends to disappear from view, be taken for granted,\nor is presumed to be unproblematic once it is built and installed.\nAfter discussing the implications of our findings, we propose a research\ndirection for the IS field that begins to take technology as seriously\nas its effects, context, and capabilities. In particular, we propose\nthat IS researchers begin to theorize specifically about IT artifacts,\nand then incorporate these theories explicitly into their studies.\nWe believe that such a research direction is critical if IS research\nis to make a significant contribution to the understanding of a world\nincreasingly suffused with ubiquitous, interdependent, and emergent\ninformation technologies.","authors":["Orlikowski","Wanda J.","Iacono","C.
