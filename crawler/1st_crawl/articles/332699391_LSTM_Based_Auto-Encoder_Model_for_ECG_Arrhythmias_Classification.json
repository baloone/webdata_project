{"id":"332699391_LSTM_Based_Auto-Encoder_Model_for_ECG_Arrhythmias_Classification","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based algorithm that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) based auto-encoder network with support vector machine (SVM) for ECG arrhythmias classification. The LSTM based auto-encoder network (LSTM-AE) is used to learn the features from ECG arrhythmias signals and the SVM is used to classify those signals from the learned features. The LSTM-AE consists of an encoder model, which extracts high-level feature information from ECG arrhythmias signals through LSTM network, and a decoder model which outputs reconstruct ECG arrhythmias signals from high-level features through LSTM network. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn better features than traditional method without any prior knowledge, presenting a good potential for ECG arrhythmias classification. In classification of five heartbeats types, including normal, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature complexes (APC), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), the proposed method achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.74%, 99.35% and 99.84%, respectively, in the beat-based cross-validation approach, and 85.20%, 62.99% and 90.75%, respectively, in the record-based cross-validation approach, in public MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. While based on the AAMI standards, the proposed method achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.45%, 98.63% and 99.66%, respectively, in the beat-based cross-validation approach.","authors":["Borui Hou","Jianyong Yang","Pu Wang","Ruqiang Yan"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIM.2019.2910342"],"references":["325587637_Automated_diagnosis_of_arrhythmia_using_combination_of_CNN_and_LSTM_techniques_with_variable_length_heart_beats","325558755_A_novel_application_of_deep_learning_for_single-lead_ECG_classification","322213305_Application_of_stacked_convolutional_and_long_short-term_memory_network_for_accurate_identification_of_CAD_ECG_signals","319271551_A_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model_to_Classify_Heartbeats","318571456_Combining_Low-dimensional_Wavelet_Features_and_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Arrhythmia_Beat_Classification","317336647_Automated_Detection_of_Coronary_Artery_Disease_Using_Different_Durations_of_ECG_Segments_with_Convolutional_Neural_Network","309343427_Arrhythmia_Classification_Based_on_Multi-Domain_Feature_Extraction_for_an_ECG_Recognition_System","305924292_ECG_Classification_Using_Wavelet_Packet_Entropy_and_Random_Forests","281081141_Real-Time_Patient-Specific_ECG_Classification_by_1D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262150762_Entropy_Index_in_Quantitative_EEG_Measurement_for_Diagnosis_Accuracy","260721206_Application_of_Cross_Wavelet_Transform_for_ECG_Pattern_Analysis_and_Classification","243458990_Application_of_Artificial_Metaplasticity_Neural_Networks_to_Cardiac_Arrhythmias_Classification","237094219_Application_of_higher_order_cumulant_features_for_cardiac_health_diagnosis_using_ECG_signals","50890888_A_robust_method_for_diagnosis_of_morphological_arrhythmias_based_on_Hermitian_model_of_higher-order_statistics","45630541_Automatic_Classification_of_Heartbeats_Using_Wavelet_Neural_Network","26671670_Cardiac_Health_Diagnosis_Using_Higher_Order_Spectra_and_Support_Vector_Machine","8629996_Support_Vector_Machine-Based_Expert_System_for_Reliable_Heartbeat_Recognition","8459885_Automatic_Classification_of_Heartbeats_Using_ECG_Morphology_and_Heartbeat_Interval_Features","7299575_Comparative_study_of_morphological_and_time-frequency_ECG_descriptors_for_heartbeat_classification","5553794_Cardiac_state_diagnosis_using_higher_order_spectra_of_heart_rate_variability","3094178_Wavelet_Distance_Measure_for_Person_Identification_Using_Electrocardiograms","326478516_An_Efficient_Compression_of_ECG_Signals_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Autoencoders","324056729_A_novel_wavelet_sequence_based_on_deep_bidirectional_LSTM_network_model_for_ECG_signal_classification","323975435_Sparse_representation_of_ECG_signals_for_automated_recognition_of_cardiac_arrhythmias","317724232_ECG-based_biometrics_using_recurrent_neural_networks","316822901_Multiresolution_wavelet_transform_based_feature_extraction_and_ECG_classification_to_detect_cardiac_abnormalities","312204763_ECG_Signal_Analysis_Using_DCT-Based_DOST_and_PSO_Optimized_SVM","311004316_A_Novel_Method_for_Classification_of_ECG_Arrhythmias_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks","310627500_A_stacked_contractive_denoising_auto-encoder_for_ECG_signal_denoising","303132021_Discrete_Wavelet-based_Fuzzy_Network_Architecture_for_ECG_Rhythm-Type_Recognition_Feature_Extraction_and_Clustering-Oriented_Tuning_of_Fuzzy_Inference_System","297676576_High-Performance_Personalized_Heartbeat_Classification_Model_for_Long-Term_ECG_Signal","293174514_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Active_Classification_of_Electrocardiogram_Signals","291385336_Arrhythmia_Recognition_and_Classification_using_Combined_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Features_of_ECG_Signals","288024040_Automatic_classification_of_heartbeats_using_ECG_morphology_heartbeat_intervals_features","282490728_A_novel_technique_for_cardiac_arrhythmia_classification_using_spectral_correlation_and_support_vector_machines","277049319_Automatic_classification_of_heartbeats_using_ECG_morphology_and_heartbeat_interval_features","270825542_Automatic_ECG_arrhythmia_classification_using_dual_tree_complex_wavelet_based_features","262691323_Detection_of_electrocardiogram_signals_using_an_efficient_method","259810163_ECG_signal_processing_for_abnormalities_detection_using_multi-resolution_wavelet_trans-_form_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_Classifier","257093667_An_ECG_signal_compression_technique_using_ASCII_character_encoding","255738430_Cardiac_decision_making_using_higher_order_spectra","255722725_Application_of_principal_component_analysis_to_ECG_signals_for_automated_diagnosis_of_cardiac_health","230712157_Heartbeat_Classification_Using_Morphological_and_Dynamic_Features_of_ECG_Signals","222432753_Optimal_selection_of_wavelet_basis_function_applied_to_ECG_signal_denoising","51709897_Weighted_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Supervised_Interpatient_Heartbeat_Classification"]}
