{"id":"288857801_Evaluation_of_the_height_3D_roughness_parameters_of_concrete_substrate_and_the_adhesion_to_epoxy_resin","abstract":"In this work a newly designed three-dimensional (3D) scanner was used in order to evaluate and describe the morphology of selected concrete substrate surfaces. A special focus was placed on the advantages and disadvantages of the latter over the other scanners. The interseting results of such an investigation for 3 differently treated existing concrete substrates are selected and presented. It was found that with an increase of maximum aggregate grain size in concrete, the values of arithmetical mean height (Sa), the root mean square height (Sq) and skewness (Ssk) for the shotblasted surface also increase, while the value of the kurtosis (Sku) grows for ground surfaces and decreases for the shotblasted surface. It was also found that there is a relation between the values of height parameters Sku and the maximum height of peaks (Sp) with the pull-off adhesion (fb) of the epoxy resin added layer and these surfaces.","authors":["Lukasz Sadowski","Sławomir Czarnecki","J.
