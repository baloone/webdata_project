{"id":"336796013_Assessment_of_Reference_Architectures_and_Reference_Models_for_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Systems_Results_of_a_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) intends to support the everyday lives of elderly people, promoting mainly their independence and dignity. Due to the growing interest on AAL from both academia and society, AAL software systems have widely contributed to set up an AAL research area. Similarly to most software areas that are in their infancy, AAL is in need of fundamental research, dealing with the basic aspects required by a new domain, e.g. software architectures. In this perspective, the investigation of Reference Architectures (RA) and Reference Models (RM) specialized for the domain of AAL is expected to be interesting to both researchers and practitioners of this community. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of a complete, detailed state of the art on RA\\&RM for the AAL domain. This lack makes the selection of RA\\&RM, when intending to use them to develop, standardize, and evolve AAL systems, a rather difficult task. In this paper we present the state of the art on such RA\\&RM, through a systematic literature review. As main results, we identified and analyzed important RA\\&RM for AAL, and spotted interesting research directions that should be explored in order to improve existing and future RA&RM for that domain.","authors":["Lina Garc√©s","Flavio Oquendo","Elisa Yumi Nakagawa"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of E-Health and Medical Communications 11(1):17","DOI:10.4018/IJEHMC.2020010102","Project: HomecARe: A reference architecture for healthcare supportive home systems from a systems-of-systems perspective"],"references":["324681957_Ambient_Assisted_Living_system's_models_and_architectures_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","304762619_Reference_Architecture_Representation_by_an_Ontology_for_Healthcare_Information_Systems_Software_Product_Line","304762438_Quality-Based_Bottom-up_Design_of_Reference_Architecture_applied_to_Healthcare_Integrated_Information_Systems_Qualty-Based_RA_Design","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","300887773_Ambient_Assisted_Living-From_Technology_to_Intervention","319141053_Two_Perspectives_on_Reference_Architecture_Sustainability","312745539_AAL-Onto_A_Formal_Representation_of_RAALI_Integration_Profiles","309486707_Quality_attributes_and_quality_models_for_ambient_assisted_living_software_systems_A_systematic_mapping","305333213_A_Quality_Model_for_AAL_Software_Systems","300008498_Using_the_NIST_Reference_Model_for_Refining_Logical_Architectures"]}
