{"id":"327428840_Integrating_tertiary_Gleason_pattern_5_into_the_ISUP_grading_system_improves_prediction_of_biochemical_recurrence_in_radical_prostatectomy_patients","abstract":"Although the presence of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 is reportedly related to unfavorable prostate cancer characteristics, few data are available regarding the effects of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 on the new ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grading system in radical prostatectomy patients. In this study, we evaluated the effect of tertiary Gleason pattern 5 on biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. We retrospectively evaluated 1000 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. The ISUP Grades were as follows: Grade 1, 16.3%; Grade 2, 48.1% (with tertiary Gleason pattern 5, 8.0% and without tertiary Gleason pattern 5, 40.1%); Grade 3, 21.9% (with tertiary Gleason pattern 5, 9.1% and without tertiary Gleason pattern 5, 12.8%); Grade 4, 3.9%; and Grade 5, 9.8%. Biochemical recurrence-free survival differed significantly among the five groups (Grade 1â€“5) (P < 0.0001). Grade 2 with tertiary Gleason pattern 5 had a significantly worse prognosis than Grade 2 without tertiary Gleason pattern 5. Similarly, Grade 3 with tertiary Gleason pattern 5 demonstrated a significantly worse prognosis than Grade 3 without tertiary Gleason pattern 5. When Grade 2 and Grade 3 were divided with or without tertiary Gleason pattern 5, the survival curves differed significantly among Grade 1, Grade 2 without tertiary Gleason pattern 5, Grade 2 with tertiary Gleason pattern 5, Grade 3 without tertiary Gleason pattern 5, Grade 3 with tertiary Gleason pattern 5, and Grade 4 (P < 0.0001) (hazard ratios: 1, 1.14, 1.86, 2.23, 3.53, and 6.30). In a multivariate analysis, integrating tertiary Gleason pattern 5 into the ISUP Grade, PSA, and surgical margin status significantly predicted biochemical recurrence (P < 0.0001). Integrating tertiary Gleason pattern 5 into the ISUP grading system will improve the accuracy of patient outcome prediction following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.","authors":["Masashi Kato","Akihiro Hirakawa","Yumiko Kobayashi","Akiyuki Yamamoto"],"meta":["September 2018Modern Pathology 32(1):1","DOI:10.1038/s41379-018-0121-8"],"references":["307599332_EAU-ESTRO-SIOG_Guidelines_on_Prostate_Cancer_Part_II_Treatment_of_Relapsing_Metastatic_and_Castration-Resistant_Prostate_Cancer","304898250_The_2014_International_Society_of_Urological_Pathology_ISUP_Consensus_Conference_on_Gleason_Grading_of_Prostatic_Carcinoma_definition_of_grading_patterns_and_proposal_for_a_new_grading_system","283206368_The_2014_International_Society_of_Urological_Pathology_ISUP_Consensus_Conference_on_Gleason_Grading_of_Prostatic_Carcinoma","341384961_HISTOLOGICAL_GRADE_HETEROGENEITY_IN_MULTIFOCAL_PROSTATE_CANCER_BIOLOGICAL_AND_CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS","313758566_TNM_classification_of_malignant_tumors","313390195_A_class_of_k-sample_tests_for_comparing_the_cumulative_incidence_of_a_competing_risk","312769304_Estimation_offailure_probabilities_in_the_presence_of_competing_risks_new_representationsof_old_estimators","312369580_TNM_Classification_of_malignant_tumors_Sixth_Edition","311791992_The_Effect_of_Limited_Tertiary_Gleason_Pattern_5_on_the_New_Prostate_Cancer_Grade_Groups","310424215_The_prognostic_role_of_tertiary_Gleason_pattern_5_in_a_contemporary_grading_system_for_prostate_cancer","309624007_Significance_of_Gleason_Score_7_With_Tertiary_Pattern_5_at_Radical_Prostatectomy","304810626_Prognostic_Significance_of_Percentage_and_Architectural_Types_of_Contemporary_Gleason_Pattern_4_Prostate_Cancer_in_Radical_Prostatectomy","303140129_A_contemporary_prostate_cancer_grading_system_A_validated_alternative_to_the_Gleason_score","298795725_The_2016_WHO_Classification_of_Tumours_of_the_Urinary_System_and_Male_Genital_Organs-Part_B_Prostate_and_Bladder_Tumours","283992889_UICC_TNM_classification_of_malignant_tumours","283543668_Clinical_Utility_of_Quantitative_Gleason_Grading_in_Prostate_Biopsies_and_Prostatectomy_Specimens","280806248_Fine_JP_Gray_RJA_proportional_hazards_model_for_the_subdistribution_of_a_competing_risk_J_Am_Stat_Assoc_94496-509","280060534_A_Contemporary_Prostate_Cancer_Grading_System_A_Validated_Alternative_to_the_Gleason_Score","269175824_Validation_of_tertiary_Gleason_pattern_5_in_Gleason_score_7_prostate_cancer_as_an_independent_predictor_of_biochemical_recurrence_and_development_of_a_prognostic_model","265015548_Adenocarcinoma_of_the_Prostate_with_Gleason_Pattern_5_on_Core_Biopsy_Frequency_of_Diagnosis_Morphologic_Subpatterns_and_Relation_to_Pattern_Distribution_Based_on_the_Modified_Gleason_Grading_System","260149191_A_Tertiary_Gleason_Pattern_in_the_Prostatectomy_Specimen_and_its_Association_with_Adverse_Outcome_after_Radical_Prostatectomy","254287847_Fine_JP_Gray_RJA_proportional_hazards_model_for_the_subdistribution_of_a_competing_risk_J_Amer_Statist_Assoc_94_496-509","245819520_Heterogeneity_of_prostate_cancer_inradical_prostatectomy_specimens","227768173_Histological_Grade_Heterogeneity_in_Multifocal_Prostate_Cancer_Biological_and_Clinical_Implications","221834213_Upgrading_and_Downgrading_of_Prostate_Cancer_from_Biopsy_to_Radical_Prostatectomy_Incidence_and_Predictive_Factors_Using_the_Modified_Gleason_Grading_System_and_Factoring_in_Tertiary_Grades","38360331_A_Class_of_K-Sample_Tests_for_Comparing_the_Cumulative_Incidence_of_a_Competing_Risk","26744481_Tertiary_Gleason_Patterns_and_Biochemical_Recurrence_After_Prostatectomy_Proposal_for_a_Modified_Gleason_Scoring_System","23185757_Prevalence_of_a_Tertiary_Gleason_Grade_and_Its_Impact_on_Adverse_Histopathologic_Parameters_in_a_Contemporary_Radical_Prostatectomy_Series","21599566_Gleason_DF_Histologic_grading_of_prostate_cancer_Hum_Pathol_23273-279","13094430_Estimation_of_failure_probabilities_in_the_presence_of_competing_risks_New_representations_of_old_estimators","12559817_The_Prognostic_Significance_of_Tertiary_Gleason_Patterns_of_Higher_Grade_in_Radical_Prostatectomy_Specimens_A_Proposal_to_Modify_the_Gleason_Grading_System","8601213_The_Prognostic_Significance_of_Tertiary_Gleason_Pattern_5_in_Radical_Prostatectomy_Specimens","7699736_Does_the_Tertiary_Gleason_Pattern_Influence_the_PSA_Progression-Free_Interval_after_Retropubic_Radical_Prostatectomy_for_Organ-Confined_Prostate_Cancer","7178562_Tertiary_Gleason_Pattern_5_is_a_Powerful_Predictor_of_Biochemical_Relapse_in_Patients_With_Gleason_Score_7_Prostatic_Adenocarcinoma"]}
