{"id":"237837519_GAMA_Multi-level_and_complex_environment_for_agent-based_models_and_simulations","abstract":"Agent-based models are now used in numerous application domains (ecology, social sciences, etc.) but their use is still impeded by the lack of generic yet ready-to-use tools sup- porting the design and the simulation of complex models in- tegrating multiple level of agency and realistic environments. The GAMA modeling and simulation platform is proposed to address such issues. It allows modelers to build com- plex models thanks to high-level modeling language, various agent architectures and advanced environment representa- tions and built-in multi-level support.","authors":["Alexis Drogoul","Edouard Amouroux","Philippe Caillou","Benoit Gaudou"],"meta":["May 2013","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 international conference on Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems","Project: Gama Platform"],"references":["234734570_A_new_BDI_agent_architecture_based_on_the_belief_theory_Application_to_the_modelling_of_cropping_plan_decision-making","229423421_An_Hybrid_Equation-based_and_Agent-based_Modeling_of_Crowd_Evacuation_on_Road_Network","221524111_GAMA_A_Simulation_Platform_That_Integrates_Geographical_Information_Data_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Multi-scale_Control","221523909_Towards_Virtual_Epidemiology_An_Agent-Based_Approach_to_the_Modeling_of_H5N1_Propagation_and_Persistence_in_North-Vietnam","278705872_Improving_Individual_Accessibility_to_the_City","278101032_A_Declarative_Model_Assembly_Infrastructure_for_Verification_and_Validation","245629134_Center_for_Connected_Learning_and_Computer-Based_Modeling"]}
