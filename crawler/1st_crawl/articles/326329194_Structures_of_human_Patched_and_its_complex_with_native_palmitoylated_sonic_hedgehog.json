{"id":"326329194_Structures_of_human_Patched_and_its_complex_with_native_palmitoylated_sonic_hedgehog","abstract":"Hedgehog (HH) signalling governs embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis in mammals and other multicellular organisms1-3. Whereas deficient HH signalling leads to birth defects, unrestrained HH signalling is implicated in human cancers2,4-6. N-terminally palmitoylated HH releases the repression of Patched to the oncoprotein smoothened (SMO); however, the mechanism by which HH recognizes Patched is unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human patched 1 (PTCH1) alone and in complex with the N-terminal domain of 'native' sonic hedgehog (native SHH-N has both a C-terminal cholesterol and an N-terminal fatty-acid modification), at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structure of PTCH1 has internal two-fold pseudosymmetry in the transmembrane core, which features a sterol-sensing domain and two homologous extracellular domains, resembling the architecture of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein7. The palmitoylated N terminus of SHH-N inserts into a cavity between the extracellular domains of PTCH1 and dominates the PTCH1-SHH-N interface, which is distinct from that reported for SHH-N co-receptors8. Our biochemical assays show that SHH-N may use another interface, one that is required for its co-receptor binding, to recruit PTCH1 in the absence of a covalently attached palmitate. Our work provides atomic insights into the recognition of the N-terminal domain of HH (HH-N) by PTCH1, offers a structural basis for cooperative binding of HH-N to various receptors and serves as a molecular framework for HH signalling and its malfunction in disease.","authors":["Xiaofeng Qi","Philip Schmiege","Elias Coutavas","Jiawei Wang"],"meta":["August 2018Nature 560(7716)","DOI:10.1038/s41586-018-0308-7"],"references":["318992512_33_A_structure_of_Niemann-Pick_C1_protein_reveals_insights_into_the_function_of_the_C-terminal_luminal_domain_in_cholesterol_transport","304249935_Activities_of_the_Cytoplasmic_Domains_of_Patched-1_Modulate_but_are_not_Essential_for_Regulation_of_Canonical_Hedgehog_Signaling","318575375_Conformational_Changes_of_CFTR_upon_Phosphorylation_and_ATP_Binding","308399474_Mechanism_of_inhibition_of_the_tumor_suppressor_Patched_by_Sonic_Hedgehog","304008766_Structure_of_human_Niemann-Pick_C1_protein","303862256_Frealign_An_Exploratory_Tool_for_Single-Particle_Cryo-EM","303634014_Structural_Insights_into_the_Niemann-Pick_C1_NPC1-Mediated_Cholesterol_Transfer_and_Ebola_Infection","303137041_Identification_of_NPC1_as_the_target_of_U18666A_an_inhibitor_of_lysosomal_cholesterol_export_and_Ebola_infection","291765296_UCSF_Chimera-A_visualization_system_for_exploratory_research_and_analysis","281081900_CTFFIND4_Fast_and_accurate_defocus_estimation_from_electron_micrographs","273118976_Identification_of_a_Family_of_Fatty-Acid-Speciated_Sonic_Hedgehog_Proteins_Whose_Members_Display_Differential_Biological_Properties","271219501_Tools_for_macromolecular_model_building_and_refinement_into_electron_cryo-microscopy_reconstructions","265342202_An_atomic_model_of_brome_mosaic_virus_using_direct_electron_detection_and_real-space_optimization","273784390_Regulation_of_the_oncoprotein_Smoothened_by_small_molecules","266081856_Alignment_of_cryo-EM_movies_of_individual_particles_by_optimization_of_image_translations"]}
