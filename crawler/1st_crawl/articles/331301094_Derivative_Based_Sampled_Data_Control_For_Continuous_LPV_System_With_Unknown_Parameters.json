{"id":"331301094_Derivative_Based_Sampled_Data_Control_For_Continuous_LPV_System_With_Unknown_Parameters","abstract":"This paper deals with the robust stabilization of a class of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in the sampled data control case. Instead of using a state observer or searching for a dynamic output feedback, the considered controller is based on output derivatives estimation. This allows the stabilization of the plant with very large parameter variations or uncertainties. The proof of stability is based on the polytopic representation of the closed-loop under Lyapunov conditions and system transformations. The result is a control structure with only one parameter tuned via very simple conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via a numerical example of a second-order LPV system.","authors":["Sonia Maalej","Alexandre Kruszewski","Lotfi Belkoura"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement and Control 141(8)","DOI:10.1115/1.4042947"],"references":["308387885_Robust_Control_for_Continuous_LPV_System_with_Restricted-Model-Based_Control","281353125_First_steps_towards_a_model-free_control_of_a_freeway_traffic_flow","260540673_Development_of_Linear-Parameter-Varying_Models_for_Aircraft","307800221_On_the_model-free_control_of_an_electropneumatic_system","284967741_A_refined_input_delay_approach_to_sampled-data_control","269308376_Derivative_based_control_for_LPV_system_with_unknown_parameters_An_application_on_a_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Motors","265707302_Use_of_models_with_aftereffect_in_the_problem_of_design_of_optimal_digital_control","261498514_Derivative_based_control_for_LTV_system_with_unknown_parameters","258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","251943089_Terminal_sliding_mode_observer_based_parameter_estimation_method_for_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor_control_system"]}
