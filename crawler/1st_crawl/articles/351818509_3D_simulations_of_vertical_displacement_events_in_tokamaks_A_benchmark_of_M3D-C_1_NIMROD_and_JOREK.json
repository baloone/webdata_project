{"id":"351818509_3D_simulations_of_vertical_displacement_events_in_tokamaks_A_benchmark_of_M3D-C_1_NIMROD_and_JOREK","abstract":"In recent years, the nonlinear 3D magnetohydrodynamic codes JOREK, M3D-CÂ¹, and NIMROD developed the capability of modeling realistic 3D vertical displacement events (VDEs) including resistive walls. In this paper, a comprehensive 3D VDE benchmark is presented between these state-of-the-art codes. The simulated case is based on an experimental NSTX plasma but with a simplified rectangular wall. There are differences between the physics models and numerical methods, and the VDE evolution leads to sensitivities on the initial conditions that cannot be avoided as can be done in edge localized modes (ELM) and sawtooth simulations (due to the non-cyclical nature of VDEs). Nonetheless, the comparison serves to quantify the level of agreement in the relevant quantities used to characterize disruptions, such as the 3D wall forces and energy decay. The results bring confidence regarding the use of the mentioned codes for disruption studies, and they distinguish aspects that are specific to the models used (e.g., reduced vs full MHD models). The simulations show important 3D features for a NSTX plasma, such as the self-consistent evolution of the halo current and the origin of the wall forces. In contrast to other reduced MHD models based on an ordering in the aspect ratio, the ansatz-based JOREK reduced MHD model allows capturing many aspects of the 3D dynamics even in the spherical tokamak limit considered here.","authors":["F.
