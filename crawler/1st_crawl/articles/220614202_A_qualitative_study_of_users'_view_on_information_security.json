{"id":"220614202_A_qualitative_study_of_users'_view_on_information_security","abstract":"Users play an important role in the information security performance of organisations by their security awareness and cautious behaviour. Interviews of users at an IT-company and a bank were qualitatively analyzed in order to explore users' experience of information security and their personal role in the information security work. The main patterns of the study were: (1) users state to be motivated for information security work, but do not perform many individual security actions; (2) high information security workload creates a conflict of interest between functionality and information security; and (3) documented requirements of expected information security behaviour and general awareness campaigns have little effect alone on user behaviour and awareness. The users consider a user-involving approach to be much more effective for influencing user awareness and behaviour.","authors":["Eirik Albrechtsen"],"meta":["June 2007Computers & Security 26(4):276-289","DOI:10.1016/j.cose.2006.11.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242104189_Technical_opinion_Information_system_security_management_in_the_new_millennium","232469062_Risk_Attitudes_and_Behavior_Among_Norwegian_Adolescents_The_Effects_of_a_Behavior_Modification_Program_and_a_Traffic_Safety_Campaign","229749634_The_Theory_of_Risk_Homeostasis_Implications_for_Safety_and_Health","223438478_Accident_prevention_Presentation_of_a_model_placing_emphasis_on_human_structural_and_cultural_factors","220427273_Users_Are_Not_the_Enemy","313153415_How_safe_is_safe_enough","290736993_Strategies_of_risk_communication_Observations_from_two_participatory_experiments","286274120_Fundamentals_of_qualitative_data_analysis","284439323_The_Organization_of_Hypocrisy_Talk_Decisions_and_Actions_in_Organizations","278910783_Risk_homeostasis_and_risk_assessment","248432154_Which_Risks_are_Acceptable","247411146_Risk_and_Culture_An_Essay_on_the_Selection_of_Technological_and_Environmental_Dangers","243768124_Secrets_and_Lies_Digital_Security_in_a_Networked","243690111_Human_Errors_A_Taxonomy_for_Describing_Human_Malfunction_in_Industrial_Installations","242618822_Scandinavian_design_On_participation_and_skill","240321457_The_Organization_of_Hypocrisy","240080970_Labor_and_Monopoly_Capital","235362971_The_Basics_of_Qualitative_Research","233869902_Risk_Society_Towards_A_New_Modernity","233506427_Experience-based_processing_of_risk_information_The_case_of_the_millennium_bug","222663292_Computer_security_impaired_by_legitimate_users","222525321_Analysis_of_end_user_security_behaviors","222504330_Risk_Management_in_a_Dynamic_Society_A_Modelling_Problem","220615235_The_human_factor_in_security","220614096_Security_training_and_awareness_-_Fitting_a_square_peg_in_a_round_hole","215666056_InterViews_An_Introduction_to_Qualitative_Research_Interviewing","30522491_Current_directions_in_IS_security_research_Towards_socioorganizational_perspectives","10947728_A_New_Approach_to_Risk_Evaluation_and_Management_Risk-Based_Precaution-Based_and_Discourse-Based_Strategies1"]}
