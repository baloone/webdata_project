{"id":"231830925_Policy_Recommendations_for_Multi-Actor_Implementation_An_Assessment_of_the_Field","abstract":"One goal frequently professed in the research field of multi-actor implementation is to assist those actually involved in the policy process by developing good, empirically-based recommendations. The primary objectives in this article are to investigate the degree of progress attained thus far toward this aim and, as a consequence, to suggest an agenda for future research. The literature is found to impose a number of restrictions on the quality of advice available to practitioners. The field is complex, without much cumulation or convergence. Few well-developed recommendations have been put forward by researchers and a number of proposals are contradictory. Almost no evidence or analysis of utilization in this field has been produced. Two reasons for the lack of development are analyzed: normative disagreement and the state of the field's empirical theory. Yet there remain numerous possibilities for increasing the quality of the latter. Efforts in this direction are a necessary condition of further practical advance.","authors":["Laurence J O'Toole Jr"],"meta":["April 1986Journal of Public Policy 6(02):181 - 210","DOI:10.1017/S0143814X00006486"],"references":["278100003_Policy_output_model_of_interorganizational_relations","274711388_Policy_Failure_An_Issue_Deserving_Analysis","249624936_Inter_Organizational_Policy_Systems_and_Research_on_Public_Organizations","347254288_Politics_and_Policy_Implementation_in_the_Third_World","343506488_The_Implementation_Perspective_A_Guide_for_Managing_Social_Service_Delivery_Programs","321600261_Policy_Implementation_in_Federal_and_Unitary_Systems_Questions_of_Analysis_and_Design","318179084_Eleven_Implementation_Amidst_Scarcity_and_Apathy_Political_Power_and_Policy_Design","312885212_Implementation_A_Theoretical_Perspective","310650394_Exchange_and_Power_in_Networks_of_Interorganizational_Relations","304115925_5_FOLLOW_THROUGH_PLANNED_VARIATION","304115845_4_TITLE_V_OF_ESEA_THE_IMPACT_OF_DISCRETIONARY_FUNDS_ON_STATE_EDUCATION_BUREAUCRACIES","300516548_Beyond_Organizational_Design_Contextuality_and_the_Political_Theory_of_Public_Policy","300516294_Small_Firm_Employment_Creation_An_Assistance_Structure_Explanation","300515998_Strategic_Interaction_Learning_and_Policy_Evolution_A_Synthetic_Model","292790644_Interorganizational_coordination_in_environmental_management_process_strategy_and_objective_USA","287112799_Anticipating_Failure_The_Implementation_of_Rural_Development_Programs","285353004_Why_is_implementation_so_difficult","283701445_Forward_and_Backword_Mapping_Reversible_Logic_in_the_Analysis_of_Public_Policy","279742415_Title_I_of_ESEA_The_Politics_of_Implementing_Federal_Education_Reform","279742331_Street-Level_Bureaucrats_and_Institutional_Innovation_Implementing_Special-Education_Reform","279404921_Bureaucratic_Discretion_and_the_National_Health_Service_Corps","274928441_Evaluating_the_New_Federalism_National_Goals_and_Local_Implementors","274839790_The_Politics_of_Policy_Implementation","274125997_Implementing_Federal_Programs_at_the_Local_Level","272587220_EPA_TVA_and_Pollution_Control_Implications_for_a_Theory_of_Regulatory_Policy_Implementation","272587137_Redirecting_the_Implementation_of_a_Law_The_Reagan_Administration_and_Coal_Surface_Mining_Regulation","271809088_Implementation_of_the_Federal_Surface_Mining_Control_and_Reclamation_Act_of_1977","271795948_Interorganizational_Policy_Implementation_A_Theoretical_Perspective","271697769_Some_Critical_Issues_in_Government_Centralization_and_Decentralization","271184717_Congress_Courts_and_Agencies_Equal_Employment_and_the_Limits_of_Policy_Implementation","270325694_Backward_Mapping_Implementation_Research_and_Policy_Decisions","270242588_Implementation","270203605_Prohibitive_Policy_Implementing_the_Federal_Endangered_Species_Act","270168582_Implementation_and_Evaporation_The_Record_of_MBO","270101790_Toward_a_Theory_of_Policy_Implementation_An_Organizational_Perspective","264120846_Interorganizational_Policy_Studies_Issues_Concepts_and_Perspectives","258122229_Implementing_Workmen's_Compensation_Programs_in_the_States","251880029_The_Utilization_Process_A_Conceptual_Framework_and_Synthesis_of_Empirical_Findings","249794899_The_Utility_of_a_Longitudinal_Approach_in_Assessing_Implementation_A_Thirteen-Year_View_of_Title_I_ESEA","249691435_Implementation_of_Judicial_DecisionsAn_Organizational_Analysis","249624942_Implementation_and_Safety_RegulationVariations_in_Federal_and_State_Administration_Under_OSHA","249624892_From_Complacence_to_ComplianceToward_a_Theory_of_Intragovernmental_Regulation","249624864_The_Policy_Implementation_ProcessA_Conceptual_Framework","249624741_From_Idea_to_ActionNotes_for_a_Contingency_Theory_of_the_Policy_Implementation_Process","248560292_Bargaining_in_Regulative_Policy_Implementation_The_Case_of_Air_and_Water_Pollution_Control","247951485_Program_Implementation_The_Organizational_Context","247951403_Bureaucracy_and_Policy_Implementation","247951398_Implementation_Revisited_The_Case_of_Federal_Demonstrations","247951113_The_Policy_Process_in_the_Modem_Capitalist_State","247733743_Interorganizational_Co-operation_and_the_Implementation_of_Labour_Market_Training_Policies_Sweden_and_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","244508407_The_Distribution_of_Power_in_Exchange_Networks","240276178_Application_of_Network_Analysis_to_the_Implementation_of_a_Complex_Project","240276128_A_Mandated_Basis_of_Interorganizational_Relations_The_Legal-Political_Network","247732765_Implementation_Structure_A_New_Unit_of_Administrative_Analysis","240689756_The_Implementation_of_Environmental_Policy_in_ChinaA_Comparative_Perspective"]}
