{"id":"276452412_Community-Academic_Partnerships_Developing_a_Service-Learning_Framework","abstract":"Academic partnerships with hospitals and health care agencies for authentic clinical learning have become a major focus of schools of nursing and professional nursing organizations. Formal academic partnerships in community settings are less common despite evolving models of care delivery outside of inpatient settings. Community–Academic partnerships are commonly developed as a means to engage nursing students in service–learning experiences with an emphasis on student outcomes. The benefit of service–learning projects on community partners and populations receiving the service is largely unknown primarily due to the lack of structure for identifying and measuring outcomes specific to service–learning. Nursing students and their faculty engaged in service–learning have a unique opportunity to collaborate with community partners to evaluate benefits of service–learning projects on those receiving the service. This article describes the development of a service–learning framework as a first step toward successful measurement of the benefits of undergraduate nursing students' service–learning projects on community agencies and the people they serve through a collaborative community–academic partnership.","authors":["Heather Voss","Launa Rae Mathews","Traci Fossen","Ginger Scott"],"meta":["March 2015Journal of professional nursing: official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing 31(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.profnurs.2015.03.008"],"references":["238334854_Community-Centered_Service_Learning_Moving_from_Doing_For_to_Doing_With","236140471_How_Health_Systems_Could_Avert_'Triple_Fail'_Events_That_Are_Harmful_Are_Costly_and_Result_in_Poor_Patient_Satisfaction","236036774_Content_analysis_and_thematic_analysis_Implications_for_conducting_a_qualitative_descriptive_study","221739019_SERVICE-LEARNING_in_Nursing_Education_Its_Impact_on_Leadership_and_Social_Justice","51747145_Service-Learning_in_the_Nursing_Curriculum_Are_We_at_the_Level_of_Evidence-Based_Practice","40847124_Long-Term_Effects_of_Prenatal_and_Infancy_Nurse_Home_Visitation_on_the_Life_Course_of_Youths","26753399_Tackling_the_Wider_Social_Determinants_of_Health_and_Health_Inequalities_Evidence_from_Systematic_Reviews","5376537_The_Triple_Aim_Care_Health_and_Cost","316683735_The_Future_of_Nursing_Leading_Change_Advancing_Health","271945601_Service-Learning_Critical_Traditions_and_Geographic_Pedagogy","263014431_Interprofessional_Global_Health_Education_at_Oregon_Health_and_Science_University_The_Interprofessional_Community_Health_and_Education_Exchange_iCHEE_Experience","262791477_Community-based_education_and_service_The_HPSISN_experience","259567077_The_Social_Determinants_of_Health_It's_Time_to_Consider_the_Causes_of_the_Causes","257814900_Service-Learning_in_Baccalaureate_Nursing_Education_A_Literature_Review","235930887_Social_Determinants_of_Health","228329483_A_Public_Health_Nursing_Research_Agenda","200602721_Service_Learning_Integrating_Student_Learning_and_Community_Service","49775690_Linking_service-learning_with_community-based_participatory_research_An_interprofessional_course_for_health_professional_students","49721728_Three_Population-Patient_Care_Outcome_Indicators_for_Public_Health_Nursing_Results_of_a_Consensus_Project","49702289_The_social_determinants_of_health_health_equity_and_human_rights","47457733_The_Bucket_List_A_Service-Learning_Approach_to_Community_Engagement_to_Enhance_Community_Health_Nursing_Clinical_Learning","41406018_From_Biloxi_to_Cape_Town_Curricular_Integration_of_Service_Learning","11077887_Partners_in_Caring_and_Community_service-learning_in_nursing_education","11077886_Theoretical_Foundations_of_Service-Learning_in_Nursing_Education","9029678_Using_Polvika's_Model_to_Create_a_Service-Learning_Partnership","8013136_Does_Service-Learning_Increase_Cultural_Competency_Critical_Thinking_and_Civic_Engagement"]}
