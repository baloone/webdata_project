{"id":"326427440_A_comparative_study_of_algorithms_constructing_decision_trees_ID3_and_C45","abstract":"Decision tree is a very popular and efficient supervised technique of machine learning. It is used and developed in order to detect meaningful rules of classification from data. Decision trees employ the top-down-divide-and-conquer strategy to get smaller and more homogeneous subsets as the construction of the tree progresses. ID3 and C4.5 are two classical algorithms of the decision trees theory; this paper discusses in detail these algorithms and presents a comparative study of them by giving the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them.","authors":["Halima Elaidi","Zahra Benabbou","Hassan Abbar"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1145/3230905.3230916","Conference: the International Conference","Project: An idea of a clustering algorithm using support vector machines based on binary decision tree"],"references":["320885751_Improvement_of_ID3_Algorithm_Based_on_Simplified_Information_Entropy_and_Coordination_Degree","265162251_A_comparative_study_of_decision_tree_ID3_and_C45","282303413_Comparative_Analysis_of_Decision_Tree_Algorithms_ID3_C45_and_Random_Forest","262349823_Probabilistic_decision_trees","235961479_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","232502159_Concept_Learning_An_Information_Processing_Problem","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","224007143_Theorie_de_l'information_et_du_codage","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","30515502_Une_approche_probabiliste_pour_le_classement_d'objets_incompletement_connus_dans_un_arbre_de_decision"]}
