{"id":"322336604_Automated_Whole-Body_Bone_Lesion_Detection_for_Multiple_Myeloma_on_68_Ga-Pentixafor_PETCT_Imaging_Using_Deep_Learning_Methods","abstract":"The identification of bone lesions is crucial in the diagnostic assessment of multiple myeloma (MM). ⁶⁸ Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT can capture the abnormal molecular expression of CXCR-4 in addition to anatomical changes. However, whole-body detection of dozens of lesions on hybrid imaging is tedious and error prone. It is even more difficult to identify lesions with a large heterogeneity. This study employed deep learning methods to automatically combine characteristics of PET and CT for whole-body MM bone lesion detection in a 3D manner. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), V-Net and W-Net, were adopted to segment and detect the lesions. The feasibility of deep learning for lesion detection on ⁶⁸ Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT was first verified on digital phantoms generated using realistic PET simulation methods. Then the proposed methods were evaluated on real ⁶⁸ Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT scans of MM patients. The preliminary results showed that deep learning method can leverage multimodal information for spatial feature representation, and W-Net obtained the best result for segmentation and lesion detection. It also outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as random forest classifier (RF), k -Nearest Neighbors ( k -NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The proof-of-concept study encourages further development of deep learning approach for MM lesion detection in population study.","authors":["Lina Xu","Giles Tetteh","Jana Lipkova","Yu Zhao"],"meta":["January 2018Contrast Media & Molecular Imaging 2018:1-11","DOI:10.1155/2018/2391925"],"references":["320307474_Automatic_digital_quantification_of_bone_marrow_myeloma_volume_in_appendicular_skeletons_-_Clinical_implications_and_prognostic_significance","318298794_Prospective_Evaluation_of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_and_18FFluorodeoxyglucose_Positron_Emission_Tomography-Computed_Tomography_at_Diagnosis_and_Before_Maintenance_Therapy_in_Symptomatic_Patients_With","318168830_Semi-automatic_Bone_Marrow_Evaluation_in_PETCT_for_Multiple_Myeloma","313857497_Automatic_Liver_and_Tumor_Segmentation_of_CT_and_MRI_Volumes_using_Cascaded_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","313686555_Whole-body_low-dose_computed_tomography_in_multiple_myeloma_staging_Superior_diagnostic_performance_in_the_detection_of_bone_lesions_vertebral_compression_fractures_rib_fractures_and_extraskeletal_fin","312067495_Efficient_multi-scale_3D_CNN_with_fully_connected_CRF_for_accurate_brain_lesion_segmentation","312015747_68GaPentixafor-PETCT_for_imaging_of_chemokine_receptor_CXCR4_expression_in_multiple_myeloma_-_Comparison_to_18FFDG_and_laboratory_values","320772783_Practical_Considerations_for_Bone_Health_in_Multiple_Myeloma","315817750_Role_of_F-18-FDG_PETCT_in_the_diagnosis_and_management_of_multiple_myeloma_and_other_plasma_cell_disorders_a_consensus_statement_by_the_International_Myeloma_Working_Group","313072928_Automatic_Liver_and_Lesion_Segmentation_in_CT_Using_Cascaded_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_3D_Conditional_Random_Fields"]}
