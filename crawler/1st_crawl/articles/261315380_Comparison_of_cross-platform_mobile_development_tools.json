{"id":"261315380_Comparison_of_cross-platform_mobile_development_tools","abstract":"Mobiles are an integral part of daily life. With time, customers are expecting good and very versatile applications in less time. It is a big challenge to develop high performance mobile applications in this competitive market that would meet the expectation of customers. Mobile operating systems vendors are giving their best available resources for making applications in more convenient ways, although the development of new applications for each mobile operating system in short time is fairly a problem. Cross-platform mobile application development tools contribute in solving this problem largely. This paper presents a pragmatic comparison among four very popular cross platform tools, which are Rhodes, PhoneGap, DragonRad and MoSync. One of the main focuses of the comparison is to provide an overview on the availability of application programming interfaces, programming languages, supported mobile operating systems, licences, and integrated development environments. Furthermore, it also presents some critical points such as the factor of extensibility in tools and the effects that they may bring on market share. The comparison is aimed at supporting developers to make the right choice with respect to their needs/constraints.","authors":["Manuel Palmieri","Inderjeet Singh","Antonio Cicchetti"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICIN.2012.6376023","Conference: Intelligence in Next Generation Networks (ICIN), 2012 16th International Conference on"],"references":["293139863_Pro_smartphone_cross-platform_development_iPhone_BlackBerry_windows_mobile_and_android_development_and_distribution","267206027_SMARTPHONE_CROSS-PLATFORM_FRAMEWORKS_A_case_study","224196645_Challenges_for_mobile_application_development"]}
