{"id":"279632503_Assume-Admissible_Synthesis","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a novel rule for synthesis of reactive systems,\napplicable to systems made of n components which have each their own\nobjectives. It is based on the notion of admissible strategies. We compare our\nnovel rule with previous rules defined in the literature, and we show that\ncontrary to the previous proposals, our rule defines sets of solutions which\nare rectangular. This property leads to solutions which are robust and\nresilient. We provide algorithms with optimal complexity and also an\nabstraction framework.","authors":["Romain Brenguier","Jean-Francois Raskin","Ocan Sankur"],"meta":["February 2017Acta Informatica 54(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-016-0273-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304341728_Synthesis_with_rational_environments","324396684_Game_Theory","313555762_Temporal_and_modal_logic","312830447_Synthesis_with_Rational_Environments","309692695_Doomsday_equilibria_for_omega-regular_games","301868002_Environment_Assumptions_for_Synthesis","300712377_Automatic_Compositional_Synthesis_of_Distributed_Systems","267132783_Game_Theory_in_Wireless_and_Communication_Networks_Theory_Models_and_Applications","264122910_How_to_Handle_Assumptions_in_Synthesis","263808401_Temporal_and_Modal_Logic_Handbook_of_Theoretical_Computer_Science"]}
