{"id":"330106902_On_some_quadratic_APN_functions","abstract":"A construction of APN functions using the bent function B(x,y)=xy is proposed in Carlet (Des Codes Cryptogr 59:89–109, 2011). At this time, two families of APN functions using this construction are known, that is, the family of Carlet (2011) and the family of Zhou and Pott (Adv Math 234:43–60, 2013). In this note, we propose another family of APN functions with this construction, which are not CCZ equivalent to the former two families on F28. We also propose a family of presemifields and determined the middle, left, right nuclei and the center of the associated semifields.","authors":["Hiroaki Taniguchi"],"meta":["September 2019Designs Codes and Cryptography 87(9):1-11","DOI:10.1007/s10623-018-00598-2"],"references":["314122252_A_family_of_semifields_in_odd_characteristic","301874256_A_family_of_semifields_in_characteristic_2","314292343_Some_Results_on_the_Known_Classes_of_Quadratic_APN_Functions","279717940_Finite_semifields","273181405_Projective_polynomials_a_projection_construction_and_a_family_of_semifields","265950829_On_involutorial_associative_division_algebras","257554695_More_translation_planes_and_semifields_from_Dembowski-Ostrom_polynomials","257481817_On_the_equation_xl21xa0x2l1xa0_over_GFk2GF2k","257481640_On_xq1axb","243071783_On_associative_division_algebras","220639061_Relating_three_nonlinearity_parameters_of_vectorial_functions_and_building_APN_functions_from_bent_functions","220335739_A_new_almost_perfect_nonlinear_function_which_is_not_quadratic","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language","51945673_On_a_Class_of_Quadratic_Polynomials_with_no_Zeros_and_its_Application_toAPN_Functions","50599861_A_new_family_of_semifields_with_2_parameters"]}
