{"id":"308734573_Learning_Outcome_Enhancement_via_Serious_Game_Implementing_Game-Based_Learning_Framework_in_Blended_Learning_Environment","abstract":"This study aims to enhance learning outcome with serious game. Game-Based Learning (GBL) framework was implemented in a blended learning environment on a specific topic namely Java programming at the foundation level. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used as research methodologies, which included a learning satisfaction survey, interviews, and classroom observations.
