{"id":"301099799_Feature_Extraction_and_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Characters_by_Homogeneous_Layers","abstract":"Artificial systems for solving difficult problems of pattern recognition are still very inefficient compared to the human visual system — at least if we regard the error rate. On the other hand characters are formed in such a manner that they can be easily distinguished by the human visual system which defines their meaning. It is not necessary that an artificial recognition system is constructed in the same way as neuronal systems; but if it is based on the same principles of perception — as far as they are known — it might have a better chance of performing the same recognition operation.","authors":["H.
