{"id":"347909824_A_Review_on_various_approaches_in_Machine_Translation_for_Sanskrit_Language","abstract":"Machine Translation is an emerging field in computer science. It is one of the most significant applications of Natural Language Processing. Aim to focus on Sanskrit in Machine Translation is to come across the language suitability, its morphology and employ appropriate Machine Translation techniques. A review has been conducted on various approaches in Machine Translation in this paper. It begins with introduction to Natural Language Processing and its applications. Different types of ambiguities are discussed. Silent features of Sanskrit language are discussed. Then focuses on Sanskrit is used for Machine Translation and highlights the language features for Machine Translation. Different approaches of Machine Translation are given like Rule based, Statistical based, Direct etc. A survey of the work done on various machine translation systems either developed or under the development. General structure for Sanskrit Machine Translation system (SMTS) is discussed.","authors":["Santosh Deshpande","Kulkarni Neha"],"meta":["January 2020"],"references":["327287889_Study_of_various_approaches_in_Machine_Translation_for_Sanskrit_Language","295257888_Sanskrit_Machine_Translation_Systems_A_Comparative_Analysis","260766552_Study_of_Example_Based_English_to_Sanskrit_Machine_Translation"]}
