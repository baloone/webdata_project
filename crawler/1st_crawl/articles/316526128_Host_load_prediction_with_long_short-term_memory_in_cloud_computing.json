{"id":"316526128_Host_load_prediction_with_long_short-term_memory_in_cloud_computing","abstract":"Host load prediction is significant for improving resource allocation and utilization in cloud computing. Due to the higher variance than that in a grid, accurate prediction remains a challenge in the cloud system. In this paper, we apply a concise yet adaptive and powerful model called long short-term memory to predict the mean load over consecutive future time intervals and actual load multi-step-ahead. Two real-world load traces were used to evaluate the performance. One is the load trace in the Google data center, and the other is that in a traditional distributed system. The experiment results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher accuracy in both datasets.","authors":["Binbin Song","Yao Yu","Yu Zhou","Ziqiang Wang"],"meta":["December 2018The Journal of Supercomputing 74(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11227-017-2044-4"],"references":["262397441_Characterization_and_Comparison_of_Cloud_versus_Grid_Workloads","262290042_Dynamic_energy-aware_capacity_provisioning_for_cloud_computing_environments","243781690_Untersuchungen_zu_dynamischen_neuronalen_Netzen","335788237_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","276096202_Multi-step-ahead_host_load_prediction_using_autoencoder_and_echo_state_networks_in_cloud_computing","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267721890_A_Practical_Guide_to_Applying_Echo_State_Networks","261302758_Host_Load_Prediction_in_a_Google_Compute_Cloud_with_a_Bayesian_Model","233730646_On_the_difficulty_of_training_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","224243861_Managing_cost_performance_and_reliability_tradeoffs_for_energy-aware_server_provisioning","220951346_Improving_accuracy_of_host_load_predictions_on_computational_grids_by_artificial_neural_networks","220594861_Improving_accuracy_of_host_load_predictions_on_computational_grids_by_artificial_neural_networks","224273557_A_genetic_algorithm_for_training_recurrent_neural_networks"]}
