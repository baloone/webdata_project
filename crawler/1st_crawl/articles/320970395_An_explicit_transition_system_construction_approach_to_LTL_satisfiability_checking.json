{"id":"320970395_An_explicit_transition_system_construction_approach_to_LTL_satisfiability_checking","abstract":"We propose a novel algorithm for the satisfiability problem for linear temporal logic (LTL). Existing automata-based approaches first transform the LTL formula into a BÃ¼chi automaton and then perform an emptiness checking of the resulting automaton. Instead, our approach works on-the-fly by inspecting the formula directly, thus enabling to find a satisfying model quickly without constructing the full automaton. This makes our algorithm particularly fast for satisfiable formulas. We construct experiments on different pattern formulas, the experimental results show that our approach is superior to other solvers under automata-based framework.","authors":["Jianwen Li","Lijun Zhang","Shufang Zhu","Geguang Pu"],"meta":["November 2017Formal Aspects of Computing 30(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00165-017-0442-2","Project: LTL Reasoning"],"references":["284044719_AUTOMATA-THEORETIC_APPROACH_TO_AUTOMATIC_PROGRAM_VERIFICATION","269311291_LTL_Satisfiability_Checking_Revisited","234785237_The_complexity_of_propositional_linear_temporal_logics_Journal_of_the_ACM_JACM_323_733-749","229157050_On_the_Relationship_between_LTL_Normal_Forms_and_Buchi_Automata","316824232_Assertion-Based_Design","284411763_An_extensible_SAT-solver","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","242614441_NuSMV_2_An_OpenSource_tool_for_symbolic_model_checking","238753709_The_tableau_method_for_temporal_logic_An_overview","236023432_The_Model_Checker_-_SPIN","225178220_Bounded_Model_Checking_Using_Satisfiability_Solving","225110362_LTL_Satisfiability_Checking","228759631_The_SMV_language","225637959_Interpolation_and_SAT-Based_Model_Checking","225158750_A_practical_decision_procedure_for_Propositional_Projection_Temporal_Logic_with_infinite_models"]}
