{"id":"224943871_Convergent_message_passing_algorithms_-_A_unifying_view","abstract":"Message-passing algorithms have emerged as powerful techniques for\napproximate inference in graphical models. When these algorithms converge, they\ncan be shown to find local (or sometimes even global) optima of variational\nformulations to the inference problem. But many of the most popular algorithms\nare not guaranteed to converge. This has lead to recent interest in convergent\nmessage-passing algorithms. In this paper, we present a unified view of\nconvergent message-passing algorithms. We present a simple derivation of an\nabstract algorithm, tree-consistency bound optimization (TCBO) that is provably\nconvergent in both its sum and max product forms. We then show that many of the\nexisting convergent algorithms are instances of our TCBO algorithm, and obtain\nnovel convergent algorithms \"for free\" by exchanging maximizations and\nsummations in existing algorithms. In particular, we show that Wainwright's\nnon-convergent sum-product algorithm for tree based variational bounds, is\nactually convergent with the right update order for the case where trees are\nmonotonic chains.","authors":["Talya Meltzer","Amir Globerson","Yair Weiss"],"meta":["May 2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235356658_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_for_Approximate_Inference_An_Empirical_Study","226423176_Convergent_Message-Passing_Algorithms_for_Inference_over_General_Graphswith_Convex_Free_Energies","224191037_Norm-Product_Belief_Propagation_Primal-Dual_Message-Passing_for_Approximate_Inference","220416605_Graphical_Models_Exponential_Families_and_Variational_Inference","8444912_Stochastic_Reasoning_Free_Energy_and_Information_Geometry","228058935_Convergent_Propagation_Algorithms_via_Oriented_Trees","221620593_Fixing_Max-Product_Convergent_Message_Passing_Algorithms_for_MAP_LP-Relaxations","220319866_Tree_Block_Coordinate_Descent_for_MAP_in_Graphical_Models","6336336_A_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_Max-Sum_Problem_A_Review","3085610_MAP_Estimation_Via_Agreement_on_Trees_Message-Passing_and_Linear_Programming","3085496_A_New_Class_of_Upper_Bounds_on_the_Log_Partition_Function","3085472_Constructing_Free-Energy_Approximations_and_Generalized_Belief_Propagation_Algorithms"]}
