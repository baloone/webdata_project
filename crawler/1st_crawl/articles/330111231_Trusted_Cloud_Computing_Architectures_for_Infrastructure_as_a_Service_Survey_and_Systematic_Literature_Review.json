{"id":"330111231_Trusted_Cloud_Computing_Architectures_for_Infrastructure_as_a_Service_Survey_and_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Cloud computing is no longer the future but the present. Security and trust are critical in cloud computing, but how can cloud service tenants trust cloud service providers to store all their private data on the cloud? Trusted computing is one of the new technologies in the last decade, and the integration between cloud computing and trusted computing can create a new architecture for infrastructure as a service that motivates more cloud service tenants to trust cloud service providers. This paper provides a survey and systematic literature review on the suggested architectures for this integration.","authors":["Fady Mohamed","Elsayed Hemayed"],"meta":["May 2019Computers & Security 82","DOI:10.1016/j.cose.2018.12.014"],"references":["327028721_M2M-REP_Reputation_System_for_Machines_in_the_Internet_of_Things","301581264_A_Trusted_Architecture_for_Virtual_Machines_on_Cloud_Servers_with_Trusted_Platform_Module_and_Certificate_Authority","288434372_Agent-based_cloud_resource_management_for_secure_cloud_infrastructures","284086694_An_improved_vTPM-VM_live_migration_protocol","272179399_Distributed_Trust_Protocol_for_IaaS_Cloud_Computing","266319064_Digital_Trust_-Trusted_Computing_and_Beyond_A_Position_Paper","262407263_A_Remote_Attestation_Approach_for_a_Secure_Virtual_Machine_Migration_in_Federated_Cloud_Environments","261568392_OB-IMA_out-of-the-box_integrity_measurement_approach_for_guest_virtual_machines","261375074_Trusted_Computing_Strengthens_Cloud_Authentication","314699097_NeuronVisor_Defining_a_Fine-Grained_Cloud_Root-of-Trust","311622540_Security_in_container-based_virtualization_through_vTPM","303393538_Trust_Modeling_in_Cloud_Computing","301428381_On_the_Control_Plane_of_a_Self-service_Cloud_Platform","299962625_An_access_control_architecture_based_on_IF-map_for_cloud_environments","296486502_TEE_A_Virtual_DRTM_Based_Execution_Environment_for_Secure_Cloud-End_Computing","296485774_Theory_and_Methodology_of_Research_on_Cloud_Security","291199996_OOAP_A_Novel_Authorization_Protocol_for_Access_to_Sensitive_Data_in_Trusted_Cloud_Computing_Platforms","287458365_Trust_Model_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment_Based_on_Fuzzy_Theory","286681479_A_novel_service_oriented_approach_of_trustworthiness_attestation_in_cloud_computing","284086865_A_security-improved_scheme_for_virtual_TPM_based_on_KVM","283819173_A_distributed_approach_towards_trusted_cloud_computing_platform","283766062_Client_Oriented_Remote_Attestation_Model_in_Cloud_Environment","283581723_An_E2E_trusted_cloud_infrastructure","281476779_A_Security_Protocol_for_Trusted_Access_to_Cloud_Environment","279014565_DTSTM_Dynamic_Tree_Style_Trust_Measurement_Model_for_Cloud_Computing","278714505_TVDc","278703088_Study_on_Security_Supervising_and_Managing_Methods_of_the_Trusted_Cloud_Computing_Based_on_Petri_Net","278665123_Terra","278305840_Design_and_Implementation_of_Remote_Anonymous_Attestation_Protocol_Based_on_Trusted_Cloud_Computing_Platform","277844896_Building_trust_into_utility_cloud_computing","276032859_A_User-specific_Trusted_Virtual_Environment_for_Cloud_Computing","273026789_Trust_Enhanced_Security_for_Tenant_Transactions_in_the_Cloud_Environment","271552131_Secure_and_reliable_VM-vTPM_migration_in_private_cloud","271478164_Research_and_implementation_of_a_role-based_trustworthiness_mechanism_for_IaaS","271417038_Real-time_remote_attestation_of_IaaS_cloud","270809581_T-YUN_Trustworthiness_Verification_and_Audit_on_the_Cloud_Providers","269364619_Research_on_Cloud_Computing_Security_Based_on_the_Remote_Attestation","269198970_Property-based_attestation_for_computing_platforms","266643243_A_Trusted_VM-vTPM_Live_Migration_Protocol_in_Clouds","262352668_Cloud_computing_security_The_scientific_challenge_and_a_survey_of_solutions","262333980_Design_and_implementation_of_a_trusted_monitoring_framework_for_cloud_platforms","261500928_Integrity_Protection_and_Attestation_of_Security_Critical_Executions_on_Virtualized_Platform_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment","261490012_The_analysis_and_design_of_trusted_computing_applied_into_cloud","261424317_Analysis_on_cloud_computing_and_its_security","261308486_Building_Trust_and_Compliance_in_the_Cloud_for_Services","261279888_TVPDc_A_Model_for_Secure_Managing_Virtual_Infrastructure_in_IaaS_Cloud","261207382_Clouds_Trust_Anchors","261042729_A_Trust_Based_Approach_for_Increasing_Security_in_Cloud_Computing_Infrastructure","260673521_Intrusion_damage_assessment_for_multi-stage_attacks_for_clouds","260607489_Counteracting_security_attacks_in_virtual_machines_in_the_cloud_using_property_based_attestation","258861311_Trusted_Launch_of_Virtual_Machine_Instances_in_Public_IaaS_Environments","255564431_Credo_Trusted_Computing_for_Guest_VMs_with_a_Commodity_Hypervisor","260309105_CloudAC_A_cloud-oriented_multilayer_access_control_system_for_logic_virtual_domain","257593331_Security-Preserving_Live_Migration_of_Virtual_Machines_in_the_Cloud","254040212_A_Trusted_Cloud_Service_Platform_Architecture"]}
