{"id":"322987854_Computational_Thinking_in_Secondary_Education_Where_does_it_fit_A_systematic_literary_review","abstract":"Computational Thinking has been described as an essential skill which everyone should learn and can therefore include in their skill set. Seymour Papert is credited as concretising Computational Thinking in 1980 but Jeanette Wing popularised the term in 2006 and brought it to the international communityâ€™s attention. Since then, increased focus and attention have been placed on Computational Thinking and more and more research has been conducted on Computational Thinking in education.\nThe first aim of this systematic literary review is to give second-level educators who are looking to include Computational Thinking into their schools and classrooms ideas and options when looking at how to achieve this. The hope is also to present reasons as to why it is important to teach Computational Thinking, along with potential issues.\nSecondly, we aim to give education researchers an overview of what work has been carried out in the domain, as well as potential gaps and opportunities that still exist. Thirdly, this is the first stage in a longer-term project to develop a Computational Thinking based curriculum which is taught using Computer Science. It is hoped that the problems, opportunities and ideas that are presented here will underpin this curriculum.\nOverall it was found in this review that, although there is a lot of work currently being done around the world in many different educational contexts, the work relating to Computational Thinking is still in its infancy. Along with the need to create an agreed-upon definition of Computational Thinking lots of countries are still in the process of, or have not yet started, introducing Computational Thinking into curriculum in all levels of\neducation. It was also found that Computer Science/Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach Computational Thinking, has yet to become a mainstream subject in some countries, although this is becoming more common. Of encouragement to educators is the wealth of tools and resources being developed to help teach \nComputational Thinking as well as more and more work relating to curriculum development. For those teachers looking to incorporate Computational Thinking into their schools or classes then there are bountiful options which include programming, hands-on exercises and more.","authors":["James Lockwood","Aidan Mooney"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.21585/ijcses.v2i1.26","Project: Computer Science To Go"],"references":["303943002_A_Framework_for_Computational_Thinking_Based_on_a_Systematic_Research_Review","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","296696274_The_Influence_of_Problem_Solving_Abilities_on_Students'_Performance_on_Different_Assessment_Tasks_in_Introductory_Programming","308842515_Problem_Posing_and_Solving_Strategic_Italian_Key_Action_to_Enhance_Teaching_and_Learning_Mathematics_and_Informatics_in_the_High_School","308840675_GK-12_DISSECT_Incorporating_computational_thinking_with_K-12_science_without_computer_access","308812666_DISSECT_Exploring_the_relationship_between_computational_thinking_and_English_literature_in_K-12_curricula","305082229_Teaching_High_School_Students_Computational_Thinking_with_Hands-on_Activities","305081700_Introducing_Computational_Thinking_to_K-5_in_a_French_Context","304285881_Collaboration_and_Computational_Thinking_A_classroom_structure","301429175_Introducing_teachers_to_computational_thinking_using_unplugged_storytelling"]}
