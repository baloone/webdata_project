{"id":"344942126_An_Optical_Flow-Based_Gesture_Recognition_Method","abstract":"The efficient human-machine interaction is an essential and current problem of computer science. The paper presents a gesture recognition method which applies optical flow calculation and an aggregation for obtaining a heatmap-like representation of the motion trajectories. After the overview of the image processing workflow, the paper introduces six symbols for providing some measurements. The described experiments show the robustness of the method against color, shape and time variance.","authors":["Dániel Zoltán Nagy","Imre Piller"],"meta":["June 2020Acta Marisiensis Seria Technologica 17(1):22-26","DOI:10.2478/amset-2020-0005"],"references":["325360023_A_Precise_Technique_for_Hand_Gesture_Recognition","278048481_Flowing_ConvNets_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_in_Videos","236160250_Hand_gesture_recognition_with_depth_images_A_review","224135926_Recognizing_Actions_by_Shape-Motion_Prototype_Trees","221546357_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_for_Human-Machine_Interaction","220774493_Gesture_recognition_using_Microsoft_KinectR","331681240_Visual_Gesture_Recognition_for_Text_Writing_in_Air","329396499_Abnormal_Behavior_Detection_in_Crowded_Scenes_Using_Density_Heatmaps_and_Optical_Flow","323148698_Structured_Dynamic_Time_Warping_for_Continuous_Hand_Trajectory_Gesture_Recognition","260721607_A_New_Writing_Experience_Finger_Writing_in_the_Air_Using_a_Kinect_Sensor","51520720_Recognizing_Human_Actions_by_Learning_and_Matching_Shape-Motion_Prototype_Trees","2913929_Lucas-Kanade_20_Years_on_A_Unifying_Framework"]}
