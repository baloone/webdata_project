{"id":"333911435_Oracle_separation_of_BQP_and_PH","abstract":"We present a distribution D over inputs in {−1,1}2N, such that: (1) There exists a quantum algorithm that makes one (quantum) query to the input, and runs in time O(logN), that distinguishes between D and the uniform distribution with advantage Ω(1/logN). (2) No Boolean circuit of quasi-polynomial size and constant depth distinguishes between D and the uniform distribution with advantage better than polylog(N)/√N.\nBy well known reductions, this gives a separation of the classes Promise-BQP and Promise-PH in the black-box model and implies an oracle O relative to which BQPO ⊈PHO.","authors":["Ran Raz","Avishay Tal"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3313276.3316315","Conference: the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["301819329_A_Note_on_Oracle_Separations_for_BQP","268689723_Forrelation_A_Problem_That_Optimally_Separates_Quantum_from_Classical_Computing","2822536_On_the_Power_of_Quantum_Computation","301870213_Succinct_quantum_proofs_for_properties_of_finite_groups","300571455_Forrelation","280181400_On_the_Correlation_of_Parity_and_Small-Depth_Circuits","242911284_Relative_to_a_Random_Oracle_A_bf_PA_ne_bf_NPA_ne_textco-bf_NPA_with_Probability_1","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","220430379_Constant_Depth_Circuits_Fourier_Transform_and_Learnability","51949185_A_Counterexample_to_the_Generalized_Linial-Nisan_Conjecture","45880343_BQP_and_the_Polynomial_Hierarchy","31318879_On_a_Formula_for_the_Product-Moment_Coefficient_of_any_Order_of_a_Normal_Frequency_Distribution_in_any_number_of_Variables","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2441438_Quantum_complexity_theory_SIAM_J_Comput"]}
