{"id":"325628401_The_Boundary_Element_Method_Applied_to_the_Resolution_of_Problems_in_Strength_of_Materials_and_Elasticity_Courses","abstract":"Strength of materials and elasticity are included within the core subjects in the School of Engineering. Modeling and simulation are fundamental in early stages of engineering design and testing. For this reason, we propose the use of a Java application named BEMAPEC in combination with hand made problems to improve the motivation of the engineering students. BEMAPEC applies the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to solve thermoelastic problems of one 3D solid, among other functionalities. Thus, with this application the students could compare solutions and visualize how the tractions and displacements are distributed on the typical problems solved in Strength of Materials and Elasticity courses. BEMAPEC provides a helpful tool for self-learning and a better understanding of the theoretical concepts.","authors":["J.
