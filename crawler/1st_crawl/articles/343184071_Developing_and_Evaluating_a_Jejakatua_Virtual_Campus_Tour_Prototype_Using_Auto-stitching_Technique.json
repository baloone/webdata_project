{"id":"343184071_Developing_and_Evaluating_a_Jejakatua_Virtual_Campus_Tour_Prototype_Using_Auto-stitching_Technique","abstract":"This paper describes the design and manufacture of virtual campuses with auto-stitching techniques. The automatic stitching technique using Insta360 allows getting a panoramic view of the 360 ⁰ campus area. The creation of a virtual campus is built by each campus to support campus promotion more fully and more closely. The prototype of the Virtual Campus Exploration (Jejakatua) application was implemented at the Faculty of Computer Science UPN “Veterans” Jatim the Jejakatua application page and evaluated by users using a set of questionnaires distributed using Google Forms. The results of testing by the black box test the built system is in accordance with the design and can be operated properly. Studying the questionnaire to 30 respondents from UPN “Veteran” Jatim academicians gave a pretty good average response. So Jejakatua is fully built using the auto-stitching method using Insta360 and is quite feasible to be implemented on Campus.","authors":["Tri Lathif Mardi Suryanto","Nur Cahyo Wibowo"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1569(2):022055","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1569/2/022055"],"references":["334236573_Web-based_Campus_Virtual_Tour_Application_using_ORB_Image_Stitching","328690208_Rancang_Bangun_Aplikasi_Jelajah_Virtual_Panorama_Berbasis_Web_Pada_Universitas_PGRI_Madiun","312485345_Smartphone_Based_Virtual_Reality_Systems_in_Classroom_Teaching_-_A_Study_on_the_Effects_of_Learning_Outcome","345469744_Educational_Games_as_A_learning_media_of_Character_Education_by_Using_Multimedia_Development_Life_Cycle_MDLC","334302013_Virtual_Tour_Panorama_360_Derajat_Kampus_Universitas_Sam_Ratulangi_Manado","334236932_Self-Efficacy_a_Critical_Factor_of_Information_System_An_Investigation_using_DeLone_McLean","332528085_Adaptive_Campus_Virtual_Tour_using_Location-Based_Services","330962904_Understanding_the_Dominant_Factors_towards_the_Intention_to_Use_Youtube_continuously_in_Indonesia","330959707_Impact_Analysis_of_System_Support_toward_Computer_Self-Efficacy_and_Effectiveness_of_User_Performance","318971281_A_Mobile_Exploration_Solution_for_Virtual_Libraries_in_Higher_Education"]}
