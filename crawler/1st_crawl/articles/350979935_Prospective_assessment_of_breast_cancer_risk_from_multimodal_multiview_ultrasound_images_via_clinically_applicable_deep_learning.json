{"id":"350979935_Prospective_assessment_of_breast_cancer_risk_from_multimodal_multiview_ultrasound_images_via_clinically_applicable_deep_learning","abstract":"The clinical application of breast ultrasound for the assessment of cancer risk and of deep learning for the classification of breast-ultrasound images has been hindered by inter-grader variability and high false positive rates and by deep-learning models that do not follow Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) standards, lack explainability features and have not been tested prospectively. Here, we show that an explainable deep-learning system trained on 10,815 multimodal breast-ultrasound images of 721 biopsy-confirmed lesions from 634 patients across two hospitals and prospectively tested on 912 additional images of 152 lesions from 141 patients predicts BI-RADS scores for breast cancer as accurately as experienced radiologists, with areas under the receiver operating curve of 0.922 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.868–0.959) for bimodal images and 0.955 (95% CI = 0.909–0.982) for multimodal images. Multimodal multiview breast-ultrasound images augmented with heatmaps for malignancy risk predicted via deep learning may facilitate the adoption of ultrasound imaging in screening mammography workflows. An explainable deep-learning system prospectively predicts clinical scores for breast cancer risk from multimodal breast-ultrasound images as accurately as experienced radiologists.","authors":["Xuejun Qian","Jing Pei","Hao Zhang","Xinxin Xie"],"meta":["June 2021Nature Biomedical Engineering 5(6):1-11","DOI:10.1038/s41551-021-00711-2"],"references":["340177557_Artificial_intelligence_versus_clinicians_Systematic_review_of_design_reporting_standards_and_claims_of_deep_learning_studies_in_medical_imaging","338830826_Computer-Aided_Diagnosis_of_Breast_Ultrasound_Images_Using_Ensemble_Learning_from_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","333228756_End-to-end_lung_cancer_screening_with_three-dimensional_deep_learning_on_low-dose_chest_computed_tomography","339837779_BIRADS_features-oriented_semi-supervised_deep_learning_for_breast_ultrasound_computer-aided_diagnosis","339222903_Breast_Cancer_Classification_in_Automated_Breast_Ultrasound_Using_Multiview_Convolutional_Neural_Network_with_Transfer_Learning","338960771_A_combined_ultrasonic_B-mode_and_color_Doppler_system_for_the_classification_of_breast_masses_using_neural_network","337584286_Added_Value_of_Quantitative_Ultrasound_and_Machine_Learning_in_BI-RADS_4-5_Assessment_of_Solid_Breast_Lesions","336755911_Computer-aided_diagnosis_system_for_breast_ultrasound_images_using_deep_learning","332089712_Automatic_classification_of_ultrasound_breast_lesions_using_a_deep_convolutional_neural_network_mimicking_human_decision-making","329715894_An_explainable_deep-learning_algorithm_for_the_detection_of_acute_intracranial_haemorrhage_from_small_datasets","326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","329803445_Automated_diagnosis_of_breast_ultrasonography_images_using_deep_neural_networks","329740202_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","325588367_A_Radiomics_Approach_With_CNN_for_Shear-Wave_Elastography_Breast_Tumor_Classification"]}
