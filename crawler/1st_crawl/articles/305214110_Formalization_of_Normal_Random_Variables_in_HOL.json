{"id":"305214110_Formalization_of_Normal_Random_Variables_in_HOL","abstract":"Many components of engineering systems exhibit random and uncertain behaviors that are normally distributed. In order to conduct the analysis of such systems within the trusted kernel of a higher-order-logic theorem prover, in this paper, we provide a higher-order-logic formalization of Lebesgue measure and Normal random variables along with the proof of their classical properties. To illustrate the usefulness of our formalization, we present a formal analysis of the probabilistic clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks.","authors":["Muhammad Qasim","Osman Hasan","Elleuch Mouna","Sofi√®ne Tahar"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-42547-4_4","Conference: International Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics"],"references":["262677365_Towards_the_Formal_Reliability_Analysis_of_Oil_and_Gas_Pipelines","259162807_Modeling_and_Evaluation_of_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Protocols_by_Stochastic_Timed_Automata","225127549_Formal_Probabilistic_Analysis_of_Stuck-at_Faults_in_Reconfigurable_Memory_Arrays","221234920_Three_Chapters_of_Measure_Theory_in_IsabelleHOL","221234907_On_the_Formalization_of_the_Lebesgue_Integration_Theory_in_HOL","221234892_Formalization_of_Entropy_Measures_in_HOL","221027168_Formalization_of_Finite-State_Discrete-Time_Markov_Chains_in_HOL","220805480_Formalization_of_Continuous_Probability_Distributions","220532316_Performance_Analysis_and_Functional_Verification_of_the_Stop-and-Wait_Protocol_in_HOL","220532315_Using_Theorem_Proving_to_Verify_Expectation_and_Variance_for_Discrete_Random_Variables","220488739_Modelling_Clock_Synchronization_in_the_Chess_gMAC_WSN_Protocol","314738042_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","305977613_Long-Range_Dependence_of_Markov_Chains_in_Discrete_Time_on_Countable_State_Space","285396395_Evaluation_of_anonymity_and_confidentiality_protocols_using_theorem_proving","275809816_Methods_of_Real_Analysis","271953342_Formal_probabilistic_analysis_of_detection_properties_in_wireless_sensor_networks","271512781_Probability_and_Measure","266196708_Methods_of_real_analysis","265356585_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis","264906545_Formal_Analysis_of_Memory_Contention_in_a_Multiprocessor_System","257680256_Formal_Reasoning_About_Finite-State_Discrete-Time_Markov_Chains_in_HOL","224113256_Model-checking_the_Flooding_Time_Synchronization_Protocol","221284113_Adaptive_clock_synchronization_in_sensor_networks"]}
