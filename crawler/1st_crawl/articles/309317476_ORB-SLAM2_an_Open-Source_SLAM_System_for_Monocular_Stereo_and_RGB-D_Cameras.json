{"id":"309317476_ORB-SLAM2_an_Open-Source_SLAM_System_for_Monocular_Stereo_and_RGB-D_Cameras","abstract":"We present ORB-SLAM2 a complete SLAM system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, including map reuse, loop closing and relocalization capabilities. The system works in real-time in standard CPUs in a wide variety of environments from small hand-held indoors sequences, to drones flying in industrial environments and cars driving around a city. Our backend based on Bundle Adjustment with monocular and stereo observations allows for accurate trajectory estimation with metric scale. Our system includes a lightweight localization mode that leverages visual odometry tracks for unmapped regions and matches to map points that allow for zero-drift localization. The evaluation in 29 popular public sequences shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, being in most cases the most accurate SLAM solution. We publish the source code, not only for the benefit of the SLAM community, but with the aim of being an out-of-the-box SLAM solution for researchers in other fields.","authors":["Raul Mur-Artal","Juan Domingo Tardos"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Robotics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TRO.2017.2705103"],"references":["291954561_The_EuRoC_micro_aerial_vehicle_datasets","281217090_Stereo_Parallel_Tracking_and_Mapping_for_robot_localization","276120886_Real-time_large-scale_dense_RGB-D_SLAM_with_volumetric_fusion","271823237_ORB-SLAM_a_versatile_and_accurate_monocular_SLAM_system","263621033_Fast_Relocalisation_and_Loop_Closing_in_Keyframe-Based_SLAM","261353760_A_benchmark_for_the_evaluation_of_RGB-D_SLAM_systems","258140919_Vision_meets_robotics_the_KITTI_dataset","224332456_Inverse_Depth_Parametrization_for_Monocular_SLAM","224252449_G2o_A_general_framework_for_graph_optimization","221344410_Scale_drift-aware_large_scale_monocular_SLAM","221221368_KinectFusion_Real-Time_Dense_Surface_Mapping_and_Tracking","221111151_ORB_an_efficient_alternative_to_SIFT_or_SURF","220396434_Large_scale_6-DOF_SLAM_with_stereo-in-hand","321816852_Meaningful_maps_with_object-oriented_semantic_mapping","315400957_KinectFusion_Real-time_dense_surface_mapping_and_tracking","309288676_Visual-Inertial_Monocular_SLAM_with_Map_Reuse","308855101_Large-scale_direct_SLAM_with_stereo_cameras","308751869_ElasticFusion_Real-time_dense_SLAM_and_light_source_estimation","261353146_Dense_visual_SLAM_for_RGB-D_cameras","260635123_Bags_of_Binary_Words_for_Fast_Place_Recognition_in_Image_Sequences","260520054_3-D_mapping_with_an_RGB-D_camera","221110313_Double_window_optimisation_for_constant_time_visual_SLAM","220659997_RSLAM_A_System_for_Large-Scale_Mapping_in_Constant-Time_Using_Stereo"]}
