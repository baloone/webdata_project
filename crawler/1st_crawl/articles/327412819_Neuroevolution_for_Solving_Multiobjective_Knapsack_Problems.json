{"id":"327412819_Neuroevolution_for_Solving_Multiobjective_Knapsack_Problems","abstract":"The multiobjective knapsack problem (MOKP) is an important combinatorial problem that arises in vari- ous applications, including resource allocation, computer science and finance. When tackling this problem by evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs), it has been demonstrated that tradi- tional recombination operators acting on binary solution representations are susceptible to a loss of di- versity and poor scalability. To address those issues, we propose to use artificial neural networks for gen- erating solutions by performing a binary classification of items using the information about their profits and weights. As gradient-based learning cannot be used when target values are unknown, neuroevolution is adapted to adjust the neural network parameters. The main contribution of this study resides in de- veloping a solution encoding and genotype-phenotype mapping for EMOAs to solve MOKPs. The proposal is implemented within a state-of-the-art EMOA and benchmarked against traditional variation operators based on binary crossovers. The obtained experimental results indicate a superior performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is advantageous in terms of scalability and can be readily incorpo- rated into different EMOAs.","authors":["Roman Denysiuk","Antonio Gaspar-Cunha","Alexandre C. B.
