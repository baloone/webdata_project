{"id":"222553025_Collecting_Statistics_Over_Runtime_Executions","abstract":"By collecting statistics over runtime executions of a program we can answer complex queries, such as “what is the average number of packet retransmissions” in a communication protocol, or “how often does process P1 enter the critical section while process P2 waits” in a mutual exclusion algorithm. We present an extension to linear-time temporal logic that combines the temporal specification with the collection of statistical data. By translating formulas of this language to alternating automata we obtain a simple and efficient query evaluation algorithm. We illustrate our approach with examples and experimental results.","authors":["Bernd Finkbeiner","Sriram Sankaranarayanan","Henny B.
