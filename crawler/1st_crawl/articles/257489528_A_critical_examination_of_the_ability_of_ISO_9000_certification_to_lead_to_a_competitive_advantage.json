{"id":"257489528_A_critical_examination_of_the_ability_of_ISO_9000_certification_to_lead_to_a_competitive_advantage","abstract":"The ISO 9000 series of standards has formalized systems for evaluating the ability of any firm to consistently design, produce, and deliver quality products and services. Despite its widespread international acceptance, ISO 9000 is surrounded by controversy and criticism. The literature is clearly divided in its assessment of ISO 9000, which is viewed as either a variant of Total Quality Management (TQM) or a paper-driven process of limited value. The primary objective of this article is to address the competing views of the standard in an attempt to show that ISO 9000 certification can be leveraged into a competitive advantage.","authors":["Sime Curkovic","Mark Pagell"],"meta":["December 1999Journal of Quality Management 4(1):51â€“67","DOI:10.1016/S1084-8568(99)80095-9"],"references":["342364990_A_ticking_time-bomb","316594935_Automotive_Quality_Systems_Handbook","313711999_Total_quality_management_and_supplier_partnerships_A_case_study","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","312602982_Creating_a_Quality_Culture_through_Organizational_Change_A_Case_Analysis","312602801_The_hot_new_seal_of_quality","312602554_ISO_9000_The_auto_impact","287823507_'UK_quality_management-policy_options'_The_Royal_Society_and_the_Royal_Academy_of_Engineering","281545394_Implementing_the_ISO_9000_standards_in_Belgium","251880092_Qualitative_Data_Analysis","247477669_Book_Review_Hybrid_Factory_The_Japanese_Production_System_in_the_United_States","246557506_ISO_9000_and_Other_Metastandards_Principles_for_Management_Practice","242569642_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","231381554_Quasi-Experimentation_Design_Analysis_Issue_for_Field_Settings","229904067_Total_customer_satisfaction_as_a_business_strategy"]}
