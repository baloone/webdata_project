{"id":"41106961_Representation_for_the_radical_of_a_finitely_generated_differential_ideal","abstract":"We give an algorithm which represents the radical J of a finitely generated differential ideal as an intersection of radical differential ideals. The computed representation provides an algorithm for testing membership in J. This algorithm works over either an ordinary or a partial differential polynomial ring of characteristic zero. It has been programmed. We also give a method to obtain a obtain a characteristic set of J, if the ideal is prime.","authors":["François Boulier","Daniel Lazard","François Ollivier","Michel Petitot"],"meta":["July 1995","DOI:10.1145/220346.220367"],"references":["245577282_Automatique_et_corps_differentiels","200018406_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Basis_for_the_Residue_Class_Ring_of_a_Zero-Dimensional_Polynomial_Ideal_in_German","36993086_Differential_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Groups"]}
