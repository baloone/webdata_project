{"id":"262330105_Bounded_epistemic_situation_calculus_theories","abstract":"We define the class of e-bounded theories in the epistemic situation calculus, where the number of fluent atoms that the agent thinks may be true is bounded by a constant. Such theories can still have an infinite domain and an infinite set of states. We show that for them verification of an expressive class of first-order µ-calculus temporal epistemic properties is decidable. We also show that if the agent's knowledge in the initial situation is e-bounded and the objective part of an action theory maintains boundedness, then the entire epistemic theory is e-bounded.","authors":["Giuseppe De Giacomo","Yves Lespérance","Fabio Patrizi"],"meta":["August 2013","Conference: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third international joint conference on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["267560949_An_Abstraction_Technique_for_the_Verification_of_Artifact-Centric_Systems","221667855_Verification_of_Relational_Data-Centric_Dynamic_Systems_with_ExternalServices","220465353_Foundations_for_the_Situation_Calculus","239577899_A_formal_theory_of_knowledge_and_action","236655908_Bounded_Situation_Calculus_Action_Theories_and_Decidable_Verification","235736561_Verification_of_Description_Logic_Knowledge_and_Action_Bases","226124485_Embedded_Finite_Models_and_Constraint_Databases","225070561_Some_Philosophical_Problems_from_the_Standpoint_of_Artificial_Intelligence","222548773_Knowledge_action_and_the_frame_problem","221604508_What_Is_Planning_in_the_Presence_of_Sensing","2585573_Reasoning_about_Noisy_Sensors_and_Effectors_in_the_Situation_Calculus","2495684_The_Frame_Problem_and_Knowledge-Producing_Actions","2455648_Model_Checking_and_the_Mu-calculus"]}
