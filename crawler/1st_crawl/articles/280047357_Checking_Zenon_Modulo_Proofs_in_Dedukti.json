{"id":"280047357_Checking_Zenon_Modulo_Proofs_in_Dedukti","abstract":"Dedukti has been proposed as a universal proof checker. It is a logical\nframework based on the lambda Pi calculus modulo that is used as a backend to\nverify proofs coming from theorem provers, especially those implementing some\nform of rewriting. We present a shallow embedding into Dedukti of proofs\nproduced by Zenon Modulo, an extension of the tableau-based first-order theorem\nprover Zenon to deduction modulo and typing. Zenon Modulo is applied to the\nverification of programs in both academic and industrial projects. The purpose\nof our embedding is to increase the confidence in automatically generated\nproofs by separating untrusted proof search from trusted proof verification.","authors":["RaphaÃ«l Cauderlier","Pierre Halmagrand"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.186.7","Conference: 4th Workshop on Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP 2015)At: Berlin, Germany"],"references":["281884930_Proof_Certification_in_Zenon_Modulo_When_Achilles_Uses_Deduction_Modulo_to_Outrun_the_Tortoise_with_Shorter_Steps","280046771_The_BWare_Project_Building_a_Proof_Platform_for_the_Automated_Verification_of_B_Proof_Obligations","265504955_Zenon_Modulo_When_Achilles_Outruns_the_Tortoise_Using_Deduction_Modulo","262317947_A_TFF1_The_TPTP_typed_first-order_form_with_rank-1_polymorphism-Version_10","287313905_Lambda_calculus_with_types","281885609_The_lP-calculus_Modulo_as_a_Universal_Proof_Language","280852081_A_Shallow_Embedding_of_Resolution_and_Superposition_Proofs_into_the_lP-Calculus_Modulo","278798643_CoqInE_Translating_the_calculus_of_inductive_constructions_into_the_lP-calculus_modulo","266859603_Why3_-_Where_Programs_Meet_Provers","265455944_The_B-book_Assigning_programs_to_meanings_Forewords_by_Professor_A_Hoare_and_Pierre_Chapron","225727410_Boogie_A_Modular_Reusable_Verifier_for_Object-Oriented_Programs","220818739_A_Proposal_for_Broad_Spectrum_Proof_Certificates","220806461_Experimenting_with_Deduction_Modulo","256082013_Lambda_calculus_with_types","220695256_The_B-book_-_assigning_programs_to_meanings"]}
