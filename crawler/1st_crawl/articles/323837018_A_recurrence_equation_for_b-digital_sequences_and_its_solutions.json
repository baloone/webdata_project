{"id":"323837018_A_recurrence_equation_for_b-digital_sequences_and_its_solutions","abstract":"The b-parts of real numbers were introduced and studied by M. H. Hooshmand. Those have some applications to b-digital sequences, radix or b-adic, and also unique finite b-representation of real numbers. Applying them for radix representation of the sum of two real numbers x and y, we obtain a recurrence equation in generalized form (for every two-sided number sequences xn and yn): Mn = [xn + yn +Mn-1/b]; n ∈ ℤ, where b≠0 is a fixed real number. In the way, we show that this equation has infinitely many solutions and, in particular, that some of them have many more properties regarding to their series and b-parts. Moreover, we prove a uniqueness theorem for the equation whenever b > 2 is an integer number and xn, yn are b-digital sequences. © International Journal of Mathematics and Computer Science, 2018.","authors":["M.H.
