{"id":"321728358_On_the_need_of_projections_in_input-error_model_reference_adaptive_control","abstract":"The main objective of this note is to contribute, if modestly, toward the understanding of the input-error model reference adaptive control scheme revealing an instability mechanism that arises if the projection of the plant high-frequency gain coefficient estimate is omitted. In addition, a self-contained proof of global convergence of the scheme with the projections for a simple first-order plant is given.","authors":["Nikita E.
