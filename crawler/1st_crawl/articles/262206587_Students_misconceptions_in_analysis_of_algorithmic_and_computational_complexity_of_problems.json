{"id":"262206587_Students_misconceptions_in_analysis_of_algorithmic_and_computational_complexity_of_problems","abstract":"Course \"Computability and Complexity\" allows students to get familiar with limits of computation and degrees of algorithmic (decidable, enumerable, undecidable) and computational (P, NP, NP-complete) complexity of problems. Students learn to use reducibility techniques for analysis of language complexity. Due to the formal and abstract nature of the studied concepts, students tend to develop a variety of misconceptions that turn such analysis to a wrong path. In our research, we analysed typical misconceptions arising in this context and their sources. We then developed a series of special purpose examples that help students to actively construct a proper understanding by confronting their misconceptions.","authors":["Mark Trakhtenbrot"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1145/2462476.2465604","Conference: Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education"],"references":[]}
