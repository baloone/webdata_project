{"id":"319393762_Foundations_of_Constructive_Mathematics","abstract":"The reader of this chapter is presumed to have some familiarity with the practice of constructive mathematics, acquired for example by studying the first half of either Bishop [1967] or Bridges [1979], together with the preceding chapter of this book. He or she will then be in a position to reflect fruitfully on the foundations of the subject. Every approach to the foundations of mathematics begins by analyzing the fundamental notions that occur again and again in the actual mathematics, and in terms of which the mathematics can be understood.","authors":["Michael Beeson"],"meta":["January 1985","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-68952-9","Publisher: Springer VerlagISBN: 978-3-642-68954-3","Project: Foundations of Constructive Mathematics"],"references":[]}
