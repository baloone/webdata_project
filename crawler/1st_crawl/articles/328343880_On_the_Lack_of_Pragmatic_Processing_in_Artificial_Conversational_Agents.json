{"id":"328343880_On_the_Lack_of_Pragmatic_Processing_in_Artificial_Conversational_Agents","abstract":"With the increasing demand for automated agents able to communicate with humans, a lot of progress has been made in the field of artificial intelligence in order to produce conversational agents able to sustain open or topic-restricted conversations. Still, they remain far from the capacity of interaction displayed by humans. This article highlights the challenges still faced in artificial social interaction regarding the contextualization of utterances within a conversation, either in chatbots or in more complex social robots, through processing of the pragmatic clues of conversations, using current knowledge in psychology and linguistics. It also suggests a number of points of interest for the development of artificial agents aimed at improving their communication with humans, the relevance of their utterances, and the relationship with the people interacting with them. We believe that in order to be recognized as a social agent, an artificial agent must follow similar rules humans follow themselves when conversing with each other.","authors":["Baptiste Jacquet","Olivier Masson","Frank Jamet","Jean Baratgin"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-02053-8_60","In book: Human Systems Engineering and Design (Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Human Systems Engineering and Design (IHSED2018): Future Trends and Applications, October 25-27, 2018, CHU-Universit√© de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France) (pp.394-399)Publisher: Springer Nature Switzerland AG"],"references":["229058790_Assistive_social_robots_in_elderly_care_A_review","224623303_Designing_robots_for_long-term_social_interaction","221473520_Footing_in_human-robot_conversations_How_robots_might_shape_participant_roles_using_gaze_cues","343383906_Looking_for_Humanity_The_Influence_of_Inferences_on_the_Humanness_of_a_Conversational_Partner_in_the_Turing_Test","327006446_The_Gricean_Maxims_of_Quantity_and_of_Relation_in_the_Turing_Test","319567561_NAO_robot_as_experimenter_Social_cues_emitter_and_neutralizer_to_bring_new_results_in_experimental_psychology","317871182_NAO_Robot_Transmitter_of_Social_Cues_What_Impacts_The_Example_with_Endowment_effect","300409314_NAO_robot_and_the_endowment_effect","276421804_Artificial_Conversations_for_Customer_Service_Chatter_Bots_Architecture_Algorithms_and_Evaluation_Metrics","259703577_Relevance_Communication_Cognition","246049244_ELIZA_a_computer_program_for_the_study_of_natural_language_communication_between_men_and_machines","227741916_Facial_Affect_and_Verbal_Context_in_Conversation","226787126_The_anatomy_of_ALICE","222555021_Pragmatics_in_human-computer_conversations","221221944_Making_Robots_Persuasive_The_Influence_of_Combining_Persuasive_Strategies_Gazing_and_Gestures_by_a_Storytelling_Robot_on_Its_Persuasive_Power","220421826_Wiezenbaum_J_ELIZA_-_A_computer_Program_For_the_Study_of_Natural_Language_Communication_Between_Man_and_Machine_Communications_of_the_ACM_91_36-45"]}
