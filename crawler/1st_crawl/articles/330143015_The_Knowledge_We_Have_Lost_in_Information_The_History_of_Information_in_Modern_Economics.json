{"id":"330143015_The_Knowledge_We_Have_Lost_in_Information_The_History_of_Information_in_Modern_Economics","abstract":"In contrast with conventional histories of “economic rationality,” in this book we propose that the history of modern microeconomics is better organized as the treatment of information in postwar economics. Beginning with a brief primer on the nature of information, we then explore how economists first managed their rendezvous with it, tracing its origins to the Neoliberal Thought Collective and Friedrich Hayek. The response to this perceived threat was mounted by the orthodoxy at the Cowles Commission, leading to at least three distinct model strategies. But the logic of the models led to multiply cognitively challenged agents, which then logically led to a stress on markets to rectify those weaknesses. Unwittingly, the multiple conceptions of agency led to multiple types of markets; and the response of the orthodoxy was to shift research away from previous Walrasian themes to what has become known as market design. But internal contradictions in the market design programs led to a startling conclusion: just like their agents, the orthodox economists turned out to be not as smart as they had thought. A little information had turned out to be a dangerous thing. © Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah 2017.
