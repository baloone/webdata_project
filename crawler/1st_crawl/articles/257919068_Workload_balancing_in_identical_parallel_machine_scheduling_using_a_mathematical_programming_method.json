{"id":"257919068_Workload_balancing_in_identical_parallel_machine_scheduling_using_a_mathematical_programming_method","abstract":"This paper addresses the workload balancing problem in identical parallel machines context. The problem consists of assigning n different jobs to m identical parallel machines in order to minimize the workload imbalance among the different machines. This problem is formulated as a linear mixed integer program to minimize the difference between the greatest and smallest workload assigned to each machine. Based on some numerical examples reported in the literature, we establish that the classical formulation which consists of minimizing the greatest machine completion time does not provide the optimal workload repartition. That is why we consider a new mathematical formulation based on the minimization of the difference between the workload of the bottleneck machine and the workload of the fastest machine. The proposed programming method is also used to provide optimal solutions in reasonable computational times for different test problems presented in the literature by Raghavendra and Murthy (10) to test their genetic algorithm.","authors":["Yassine Ouazene","Farouk Yalaoui","Hicham Chehade","Alice Yalaoui"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 7(sup1):58-67","DOI:10.1080/18756891.2013.853932"],"references":["251961332_Parallel_Machine_Scheduling_with_Load_Balancing_and_Sequence_Dependent_Setups","220778961_Better_bounds_for_online_load_balancing_on_unrelated_machines","289973998_Workload_balancing_in_identical_parallel_machine_scheduling_while_planning_in_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_genetic_algorithm","265459019_Parallel_machine_scheduling_problems_A_survey","226693814_A_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_loading_problem_in_flexible_manufacturing_systems","225720680_Workflow_balancing_in_parallel_machines_through_genetic_algorithm","225692353_Workflow_balancing_strategies_in_parallel_machine_scheduling","222392869_A_genetic_algorithm_for_minimizing_the_makespan_in_the_case_of_scheduling_identical_parallel_machines","222087594_An_operator_load-balancing_problem_in_a_semi-automatic_parallel_machine_shop","222029329_Minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_square_for_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors"]}
