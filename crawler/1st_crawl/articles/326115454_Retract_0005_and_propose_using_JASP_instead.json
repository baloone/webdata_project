{"id":"326115454_Retract_0005_and_propose_using_JASP_instead","abstract":"Seeking to address the lack of research reproducibility, Benjamin et al. propose a pragmatic solution: use a stricter 0.005 standard for statistical significance when claiming evidence of new discoveries. Notwithstanding its potential impact, the proposal has motivated a large mass of authors to dispute it. In reality, a simpler and better suited alternative proposal exists, perhaps the only one the authors could be entitled to make from their Jeffresian perspective: Use JASP, the stand-alone, free-to-download, R-based statistical software with user-friendly GUI for learning more about your error statistics and your beliefs.","authors":["Jose Perezgonzalez","Dolores Fr√≠as-navarro"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.31234/osf.io/t2fn8","Project: Research practices.
