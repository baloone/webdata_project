{"id":"329126323_ShExML_An_heterogeneous_data_mapping_language_based_on_ShEx","abstract":"Data interoperability is currently a problem that we are facing\nmore intensely due to the appearance of fields like Big Data or IoT.\nMany data is persisted in information silos with neither interconnection\nnor format homogenisation. Our proposal to alleviate this problem is\nShExML, a language based on ShEx that can map and merge heterogeneous\ndata formats into a single RDF representation. We advocate the\ncreation of this type of tools that can facilitate the migration of nonsemantic\ndata to the Semantic Web.","authors":["Herminio García-González","Daniel Fernández-Álvarez","Jose Emilio Labra Gayo"],"meta":["November 2018","Conference: EKAW 2018"],"references":[]}
