{"id":"315137160_Mobile_educational_applications_for_children_What_educators_and_parents_need_to_know","abstract":"The popularity of smart mobile devices is growing fast. These digital devices represent a new generation of technological tools that offer remarkable access to content as well as opportunities for creative use even by young children. Most the best-selling paid apps in the education category are targeted towards children. At the same time, the educational value of those applications is difficult to be determined. Parents and educators, who are turning to those devices for the potential educational benefits they expect for their children and/or their students, have a limited number of tools with which to evaluate these apps. With regard to the literature review, we present the latest findings related to the real educational value of these ‘self-proclaimed’ educational apps. Our analysis concludes that while there are thousands of apps available today, choosing the most appropriate educational ones for children is difficult and problematic for both teachers and educators.","authors":["Stamatios J Papadakis","Michail Kalogiannakis"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Mobile Learning and Organisation 11(2):1","DOI:10.1504/IJMLO.2017.10003925","Project: Educational apps assessment"],"references":["313849509_Using_Scratch_and_App_Inventor_for_teaching_introductory_programming_in_secondary_education_A_case_study","313087810_Designing_and_creating_an_educational_app_rubric_for_preschool_teachers","310744349_Creativity_and_innovation_in_European_education_10_years_eTwinning_Past_present_and_the_future","310733787_Using_Scratch_and_App_Inventor_for_teaching_introductory_programming_in_Secondary_Education_A_case_study","309861834_Comparing_Tablets_and_PCs_in_teaching_Mathematics_An_attempt_to_improve_Mathematics_Competence_in_Early_Childhood_Education","305390965_Developing_fundamental_programming_concepts_and_computational_thinking_with_ScratchJr_in_preschool_education_A_case_study","346836811_iPlay_iLearn_iGrow","319260872_The_Universal_Access_Handbook","305218395_Focus_on_Inclusive_Education_Evaluating_Apps_for_Students_With_Disabilities_Supporting_Academic_Access_and_Success_Bradley_Witzel_Editor","303173972_Qualitative_Examination_of_Two_Year-Olds_Interaction_With_Tablet_Based_Interactive_Technology"]}
