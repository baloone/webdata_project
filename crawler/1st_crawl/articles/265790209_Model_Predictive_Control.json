{"id":"265790209_Model_Predictive_Control","abstract":"From power plants to sugar refining, model predictive control (MPC) schemes have established themselves as the preferred control strategies for a wide variety of processes.\n\nThe second edition of Model Predictive Control provides a thorough introduction to theoretical and practical aspects of the most commonly used MPC strategies. It bridges the gap between the powerful but often abstract techniques of control researchers and the more empirical approach of practitioners. Model Predictive Control demonstrates that a powerful technique does not always require complex control algorithms.\n\nThe text features material on the following subjects:\n\ngeneral MPC elements and algorithms; \n\ncommercial MPC schemes; \n\ngeneralized predictive control \n\nmultivariable, robust, constrained nonlinear and hybrid MPC; \n\nfast methods for MPC implementation; \n\napplications. \n\nAll of the material is thoroughly updated for the second edition with the chapters on nonlinear MPC, MPC and hybrid systems and MPC implementation being entirely new. Many new exercises and examples have also have also been added throughout and MatlabÂ® programs to aid in their solution can be downloaded from the authors' website at http://www.esi.us.es/MPCBOOK. The text is an excellent aid for graduate and advanced undergraduate students and will also be of use to researchers and industrial practitioners wishing to keep abreast of a fast-moving field.","authors":["Eduardo F.
