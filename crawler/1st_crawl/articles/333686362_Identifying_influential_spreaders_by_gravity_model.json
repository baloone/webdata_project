{"id":"333686362_Identifying_influential_spreaders_by_gravity_model","abstract":"Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks is crucial in understanding, controlling and accelerating spreading processes for diseases, information, innovations, behaviors, and so on. Inspired by the gravity law, we propose a gravity model that utilizes both neighborhood information and path information to measure a nodeâ€™s importance in spreading dynamics. In order to reduce the accumulated errors caused by interactions at distance and to lower the computational complexity, a local version of the gravity model is further proposed by introducing a truncation radius. Empirical analyses of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) spreading dynamics on fourteen real networks show that the gravity model and the local gravity model perform very competitively in comparison with well-known state-of-the-art methods. For the local gravity model, the empirical results suggest an approximately linear relation between the optimal truncation radius and the average distance of the network.","authors":["Zhe Li","Tao Ren","Xiaoqi Ma","Simiao Liu"],"meta":["June 2019Scientific Reports 9(1):8387","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-44930-9"],"references":["323184481_Destination_Choice_Game_A_Spatial_Interaction_Theory_on_Human_Mobility","290522336_The_H-index_of_a_network_node_and_its_relation_to_degree_and_coreness","279633303_Influence_maximization_in_complex_networks_through_optimal_percolation","275588384_Locating_influential_nodes_via_dynamics-sensitive_centrality","262189601_Asymmetrically_interacting_spreading_dynamics_on_complex_layered_networks","318917040_Local_Higher-Order_Graph_Clustering","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","283598027_Learning_to_discover_social_circles_in_ego_networks","276211427_Identifying_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks_based_on_gravity_formula","273354153_The_Spread_of_Obesity_in_a_Large_Social_Network_Over_32_Years"]}
