{"id":"283279798_Reversing_Single_Sessions","abstract":"Session-based communication has gained a widespread acceptance in practice as\na means for developing safe communicating systems via structured interactions.\nIn this paper, we investigate how these structured interactions are affected by\nreversibility, which provides a computational model allowing executed\ninteractions to be undone. In particular, we provide a systematic study of the\nintegration of different notions of reversibility in both binary and multiparty\nsingle sessions. The considered forms of reversibility are: one for completely\nreversing a given session with one backward step, and another for also\nrestoring any intermediate state of the session with either one backward step\nor multiple ones. We analyse the costs of reversing a session in all these\ndifferent settings. Our results show that extending binary single sessions to\nmultiparty ones does not affect the reversibility machinery and its costs.","authors":["Francesco Tiezzi","Nobuko Yoshida"],"meta":["October 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278623175_Causal-Consistent_Reversibility","275103612_Reversible_session-based_Pi-calculus","272373402_Session_typing_and_asynchronous_subtyping_for_the_higher-order_p-calculus","265089483_Compliance_for_reversible_clientserver_interactions","262412073_Globally_Governed_Session_Semantics","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","228796126_Reversible_Communicating_Concurrent_Systems","222527205_Language_Primitives_and_Type_Discipline_for_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming_Revisited_Two_Systems_for_Higher-Order_Session_Communication","221602730_Language_Primitives_and_Type_Discipline_for_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming","220997896_Multiparty_Asynchonous_Session_Types","220997541_Minimal_and_Optimal_Computations_of_Recursive_Programs","220716176_Asynchronous_Session_Types_and_Progress_for_Object_Oriented_Languages","220700934_Reversible_Communicating_Systems","220700540_Controlling_Reversibility_in_Higher-Order_Pi","220700366_Transactions_in_RCCS","220431629_Minimal_and_Optimal_Computations_of_Recursive_Programs","220118443_Reversing_algebraic_process_calculi","303789186_Multiparty_asynchronous_session_types","280218254_Sub-behaviour_relations_for_session-based_clientserver_systems","233765921_A_Reversible_Abstract_Machine_and_Its_Space_Overhead","221218680_Reversible_structures","220700991_Reversing_Higher-Order_Pi","220248383_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_I"]}
