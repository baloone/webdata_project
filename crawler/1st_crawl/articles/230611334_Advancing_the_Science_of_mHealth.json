{"id":"230611334_Advancing_the_Science_of_mHealth","abstract":"Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to greatly impact health research, health care, and health outcomes, but the exponential growth of the technology has outpaced the science. This article outlines two initiatives designed to enhance the science of mHealth. The mHealth Evidence Workshop used an expert panel to identify optimal methodological approaches for mHealth research. The NIH mHealth Training Institutes address the silos among the many academic and technology areas in mHealth research and is an effort to build the interdisciplinary research capacity of the field. Both address the growing need for high quality mobile health research both in the United States and internationally. mHealth requires a solid, interdisciplinary scientific approach that pairs the rapid change associated with technological progress with a rigorous evaluation approach. The mHealth Evidence Workshop and the NIH mHealth Training Institutes were both designed to address and further develop this scientific approach to mHealth.","authors":["Wendy Jean Nilsen","Santosh Kumar","Albert Shar","Carrie Varoquiers"],"meta":["May 2012Journal of Health Communication 17 Suppl 1(sup1):5-10","DOI:10.1080/10810730.2012.677394","SourcePubMed"],"references":["51626394_Quasi-Experimental_Designs_in_Practice-based_Research_Settings_Design_and_Implementation_Considerations","47679194_Open_mHealth_Architecture_An_Engine_for_Health_Care_Innovation","237035223_Clinical_Practice_Improvement_Methodology_Implementation_and_Evaluation","51037730_N-of-1_Trials_in_the_Medical_Literature","49849502_iPhone_Apps_for_Smoking_Cessation","8142358_An_experimental_design_for_the_development_of_adaptive_treatment_strategies","7662423_A_strategy_for_optimizing_and_evaluating_behavioral_interventions","6956598_Design_and_analysis_of_stepped_wedge_cluster_randomized_trials","6572634_Expanding_Priorities_-_Confronting_Chronic_Disease_in_Countries_with_Low_Income","4041765_Sensing_and_modeling_human_networks_using_the_sociometer"]}
