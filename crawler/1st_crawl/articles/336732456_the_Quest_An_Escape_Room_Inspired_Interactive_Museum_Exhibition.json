{"id":"336732456_the_Quest_An_Escape_Room_Inspired_Interactive_Museum_Exhibition","abstract":"In this project, we report on designing an interactive museum exhibit in a technology museum, inspired by escape room game mechanics and technology. The project aims to create a deeper more immersed engagement with and interest in the exhibition, and thereby increase the interest in the exhibit's subject. In the game, the players take on the role of grandchildren to a known (fictitious) turn-of-the-century explorer and set out to find the treasures she hid around the world during her years of adventure. Clues to the treasures are hidden within the museum exhibition and by using knowledge found around the exhibition the players can solve the riddles and find the treasure, while also picking up some knowledge along the way.","authors":["Jon Back","Svante Back","Emma Bexell","Stefan Stanisic"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1145/3341215.3356987","Conference: Extended Abstracts of the Annual Symposium"],"references":["348870975_Escape_Room_Games_Can_you_transform_an_unpleasant_situation_into_a_pleasant_one","37688338_Shared_Fantasy_Role-Playing_Games_as_Social_Worlds"]}
