{"id":"348946639_A_digital_twin_of_Earth_for_the_green_transition","abstract":"For its green transition, the EU plans to fund the development of digital twins of Earth. For these twins to be more than big data atlases, they must create a qualitatively new Earth system simulation and observation capability using a methodological framework responsible for exceptional advances in numerical weather prediction.","authors":["Peter Bauer","Bjorn Stevens","Wilco Hazeleger"],"meta":["February 2021Nature Climate Change 11(2):1-4","DOI:10.1038/s41558-021-00986-y"],"references":["340002829_Drones_and_global_navigation_satellite_systems_current_evidence_from_polar_scientists","338991757_From_Smart_Farming_towards_Agriculture_50_A_Review_on_Crop_Data_Management","337713342_The_scientific_challenge_of_understanding_and_estimating_climate_change","336039354_Make_more_digital_twins","333447860_Global_Observing_Needs_in_the_Deep_Ocean","333174652_Global_Cloud-Resolving_Models","316240052_Big_IoT_Data_Analytics_Architecture_Opportunities_and_Open_Research_Challenges","281516336_The_quiet_revolution_of_numerical_weather_prediction","346046871_Europe_is_building_a_'digital_twin'_of_Earth_to_revolutionize_climate_forecasts","336546017_A_Distributed_Small_Satellite_Approach_for_Measuring_Convective_Transports_in_the_Earth's_Atmosphere","331089977_Deep_learning_and_process_understanding_for_data-driven_Earth_system_science","322315957_Science_and_research_policy_at_the_end_of_Moore's_law","278099828_Atmospheric_circulation_as_a_source_of_uncertainty_in_climate_change_projections","222549799_Strategies_to_Adapt_to_an_Uncertain_Climate_Change"]}
