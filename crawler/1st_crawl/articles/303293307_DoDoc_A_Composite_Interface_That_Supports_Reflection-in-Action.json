{"id":"303293307_DoDoc_A_Composite_Interface_That_Supports_Reflection-in-Action","abstract":"In this exploratory design study, we present DoDoc: a system that enables users to collect and keep traces of embodied activities using four different media. DoDoc has been designed to support learning by doing pedagogies by collecting digital material for reflection during making or playing activities. We report the results of the deployment of DoDoc during a French Digital Technology Fair; we derive the concept of composite interfaces; and we discuss the importance of flexibility when designing trace-collecting systems. We also map the different use-cases suggested by the users, which sketches a design space for future explorations.","authors":["Pauline Gourlet","Sarah Garcin","Louis Eveillard","Ferdinand Dervieux"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1145/2839462.2839506","Conference: Proceedings of the TEI '16: Tenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied InteractionAt: Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"references":["281495128_Digital_Fabrication_and_'Making'_in_Education_The_The_Democratization_of_Invention","272741194_Les_instruments_transitionnels_une_proposition_pour_etudier_la_diachronie_des_activites_narratives","271482308_Interaction_Design_as_a_Bricolage_Practice","262406805_Conceptualising_tangibles_to_support_learning","262360047_Kids_story_writers_POGO_Tell-Tale_Sprite","309476264_The_computer_for_the_21_st_century","282982363_Escaping_the_Sandbox_Making_and_Its_Future","276935294_Comment_inciter_les_regulations_metacognitives_pour_favoriser_la_resolution_de_problemes_mal_structures","266658272_Product_versus_process_Representing_and_appropriating_DIY_projects_online","257918991_The_Computer_for_the_21st_Century"]}
