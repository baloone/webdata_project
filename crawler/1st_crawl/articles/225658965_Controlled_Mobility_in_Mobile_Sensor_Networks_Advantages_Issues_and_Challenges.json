{"id":"225658965_Controlled_Mobility_in_Mobile_Sensor_Networks_Advantages_Issues_and_Challenges","abstract":"Recently, wireless self-organizing networks are attracting a lot of interest in the research community. Moreover, in the last\ndecade many mobile devices have appeared in the market. Exploiting mobility in a wireless environment, instead of considering\nit as a kind of disturbance, is a fundamental concept that the research community is beginning to appreciate now. Of course,\nthe advantages obtainable through the use of the mobility imply the knowledge of the different types of mobility and the way\nto include it in the management architecture of the wireless networks. In this work we claim that mobility and wireless sensor\nnetworks can be considered as two synergetic elements of the same reality. For this purpose, we sketch a macro-classification\nof the different objectives which can be pursued by controlled mobility. Moreover, we identify and highlight the interactions\nbetween this specific type of mobility and the layers of the control stack. Lastly, this paper reports a case study in which\nwe show how controlled mobility can be exploited practically.\n\nKeywordsControlled mobility–Mobile sensor networks–Self-organizing networks","authors":["Enrico Natalizio","V.
