{"id":"315967207_Demystification_of_Vedic_Multiplication_Algorithm","abstract":"The Vedic multiplication algorithm is a very fast way of oral\ncalculation. However, the basis of the algorithm is not available so far. The present\npaper demystifies the general Vedic algorithm for multiplication by\nestablishment of foundation of the Vedic algorithm of product finding through\nend results of conventional multiplication. This novel approach, i.e.,\nfinding algorithm from the end results of conventional calculations may be\nuseful in devising algorithms similar to Vedic in cases of other calculations.\nThough the availability of cheap calculators made the Vedic Method obsolete,\nthe present trend resurrected Vedic algorithms by their use in the design of\ncomputer processors for enhancing speed and performance.","authors":["Manohar Mathur","Aarnav"],"meta":["January 2017American Journal of Computational Mathematics 07(01):94-101","DOI:10.4236/ajcm.2017.71008"],"references":["334121989_High-Performance_FIR_Filter_Implementation_Using_Anurupye_Vedic_Multiplier","271832356_Vedic_Mathematics_in_Computer_A_Survey","271156937_Ancient_Indian_Vedic_Mathematics_based_32-Bit_Multiplier_Design_for_High_Speed_and_Low_Power_Processors","266863131_Vedic_Mathematics_Based_32-Bit_Multiplier_Design_for_High_Speed_Low_Power_Processors","242433833_Vedic_Computation_Redefining_Computer_Science_in_the_Light_of_Maharishi_Vedic_Science","343627264_Application_of_Vedic_Mathematics_In_Computer_Architecture","254572355_Secrets_of_Mental_Math_The_Mathemagician's_Guide_to_Lightning_Calculation_and_Amazing_Math_Tricks"]}
