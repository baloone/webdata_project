{"id":"304860437_Multimedia_Learning_Second_Edition","abstract":"For hundreds of years verbal messages such as lectures and printed lessons have been the primary means of explaining ideas to learners. Although verbal learning offers a powerful tool, this book explores ways of going beyond the purely verbal. Recent advances in graphics technology have prompted new efforts to understand the potential of multimedia and multimedia learning as a means of promoting human understanding. In Multimedia Learning, Second Edition, Richard E. Mayer asks whether people learn more deeply when ideas are expressed in words and pictures rather than in words alone. He reviews twelve principles of instructional design that are based on experimental research studies and grounded in a theory of how people learn from words and pictures. The result is what Mayer calls the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, a theory introduced in the first edition of Multimedia Learning and further developed in The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning.","authors":["Richard Mayer"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511811678"],"references":["240220411_Effects_of_a_Visible_Author_in_Statistical_Texts","232552432_Signaling_in_Expository_Hypertexts_Compensates_for_Deficits_in_Reading_Skill","229696315_Preschool_children's_visual_attention_to_attributes_of_television","225479808_Encoding_and_Retaining_Information_in_the_Visuals_and_Verbals_of_an_Educational_Movie","284573317_Instructional_strategies_for_virtual_aviation_training_environments","249022591_The_Effect_of_Related_and_Unrelated_Details_on_the_Recall_of_Major_Ideas_in_Prose","248114078_Learning_with_media_Restructuring_the_debate","232431319_Effect_of_Interest_on_Attention_and_Learning","226827042_The_effects_of_technical_illustrations_on_cognitive_load","15229796_Improving_examples_to_improve_transfer_to_novel_problems"]}
