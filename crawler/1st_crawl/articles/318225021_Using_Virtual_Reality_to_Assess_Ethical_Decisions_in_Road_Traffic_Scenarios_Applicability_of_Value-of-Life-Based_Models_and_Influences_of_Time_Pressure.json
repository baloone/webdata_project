{"id":"318225021_Using_Virtual_Reality_to_Assess_Ethical_Decisions_in_Road_Traffic_Scenarios_Applicability_of_Value-of-Life-Based_Models_and_Influences_of_Time_Pressure","abstract":"Self-driving cars are posing a new challenge to our ethics. Previous research has shown that moral judgment and behavior are highly context-dependent, and comprehensive and nuanced models of the underlying cognitive processes are out of reach to date. Models of ethics for self-driving cars should thus aim to match human decisions made in the same context. Our model comparison shows that simple models based on one-dimensional value-of-life scales are suited to describe human ethical behavior in these situations. Furthermore, we examined the influence of severe time pressure on the decision-making process. This study also demonstrates the suitability of virtual reality for the assessment of ethical behavior in humans, delivering consistent results across subjects, while closely matching the experimental settings to the real world scenarios in question.","authors":["Leon Sütfeld","Richard Gast","Peter König","Gordon Pipa"],"meta":["July 2017Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 11","DOI:10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00122","Projects: Moral Decision MakingSocializing Sensorimotor Contingencies - socSMCs"],"references":["309007020_Virtual_Morality_Transitioning_from_Moral_Judgment_to_Moral_Action","305267388_Autonomous_Cars_In_Favor_of_a_Mandatory_Ethics_Setting","301293464_The_Social_Dilemma_of_Autonomous_Vehicles","300567119_Machine_Ethics_and_Automated_Vehicles","300136522_Why_Ethics_Matters_for_Autonomous_Cars","280807310_Ethical_Decision_Making_During_Automated_Vehicle_Crashes","270662033_Forced-choice_decision-making_in_modified_trolley_dilemma_situations_A_virtual_reality_and_eye_tracking_study","306178254_Sollte_mein_Auto_mich_umbringen_wollen_mussen_Das_Google-Auto_und_die_Ethik","304403484_Our_driverless_dilemma","274411823_The_Trolley_Problem"]}
