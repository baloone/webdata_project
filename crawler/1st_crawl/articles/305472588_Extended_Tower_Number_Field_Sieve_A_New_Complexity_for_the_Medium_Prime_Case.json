{"id":"305472588_Extended_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve_A_New_Complexity_for_the_Medium_Prime_Case","abstract":"We introduce a new variant of the number field sieve algorithm for discrete logarithms in \\(\\mathbb {F}_{p^n}\\) called exTNFS. The most important modification is done in the polynomial selection step, which determines the cost of the whole algorithm: if one knows how to select good polynomials to tackle discrete logarithms in \\(\\mathbb {F}_{p^\\kappa }\\), exTNFS allows to use this method when tackling \\(\\mathbb {F}_{p^{\\eta \\kappa }}\\) whenever \\(\\gcd (\\eta ,\\kappa )=1\\). This simple fact has consequences on the asymptotic complexity of NFS in the medium prime case, where the complexity is reduced from \\(L_Q(1/3,\\root 3 \\of {96/9})\\) to \\(L_Q(1/3,\\root 3 \\of {48/9})\\), \\(Q=p^n\\), respectively from \\(L_Q(1/3,2.15)\\) to \\(L_Q(1/3,1.71)\\) if multiple number fields are used. On the practical side, exTNFS can be used when \\(n=6\\) and \\(n=12\\) and this requires to updating the keysizes used for the associated pairing-based cryptosystems.","authors":["Taechan Kim","Razvan Barbulescu"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53018-4_20","Conference: Annual Cryptology Conference"],"references":["260870163_Implementing_Pairings_at_the_192-Bit_Security_Level","255673189_Discrete_Logarithms_in_GFP_Using_the_Number_Field_Sieve","225673791_A_Taxonomy_of_Pairing-Friendly_Elliptic_Curves","221355610_The_Number_Field_Sieve_in_the_Medium_Prime_Case","221274540_Pairing-Friendly_Elliptic_Curves_of_Prime_Order","324435437_Algorithms_for_discrete_logarithm_in_finite_fields","312823567_The_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_with_Conjugation_and_Generalized_Joux-Lercier_Methods","311160765_On_Instantiating_Pairing-Based_Protocols_with_Elliptic_Curves_of_Embedding_Degree_One","305782223_A_Homomorphic_LWE_Based_E-voting_Scheme","301670589_New_Complexity_Trade-Offs_for_the_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_Algorithm_in_Non-Prime_Fields","281886478_Improving_NFS_for_the_Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_in_Non-prime_Finite_Fields","281184304_Algorithms_of_discrete_logarithm_in_finite_fields","278828652_The_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_with_Conjugation_Method","278619833_The_Tower_Number_Field_Sieve","268022030_The_Special_Number_Field_Sieve_in_mathbbF_pn","266999067_The_Multiple_Number_Field_Sieve_for_Medium_and_High_Characteristic_Finite_Fields","245942202_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Local_Units","242987595_Bounds_for_resultants_of_univariate_and_bivariate_polynomials","239665570_The_future_of_integer_factorization","239524620_A_Heuristic_Quasi-Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Logarithm_in_Finite_Fields_of_Small_Characteristic","227161686_Constructing_Pairing-Friendly_Elliptic_Curves_with_Embedding_Degree_10","221425405_High-Speed_Software_Implementation_of_the_Optimal_Ate_Pairing_over_Barreto-Naehrig_Curves","221327071_Unbelievable_Security_Matching_AES_Security_Using_Public_Key_Systems","221010620_An_Algorithm_to_Solve_the_Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_with_the_Number_Field_Sieve","220577527_Using_number_fields_to_compute_logarithms_in_finite_fields","220334575_Factorization_of_RSA-180","44795383_A_Kilobit_Special_Number_Field_Sieve_Factorization","28641142_Factoring_Integers_with_Elliptic_Curves","3084269_Solving_sparse_linear_equations_over_finite_fields"]}
