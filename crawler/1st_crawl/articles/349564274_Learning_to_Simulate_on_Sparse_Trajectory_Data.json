{"id":"349564274_Learning_to_Simulate_on_Sparse_Trajectory_Data","abstract":"Simulation of the real-world traffic can be used to help validate the transportation policies. A good simulator means the simulated traffic is similar to real-world traffic, which often requires dense traffic trajectories (i.e., with high sampling rate) to cover dynamic situations in the real world. However, in most cases, the real-world trajectories are sparse, which makes simulation challenging. In this paper, we present a novel framework ImIn-GAIL to address the problem of learning to simulate the driving behavior from sparse real-world data. The proposed architecture incorporates data interpolation with the behavior learning process of imitation learning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the data sparsity issue for behavior learning problems. We investigate our framework on both synthetic and real-world trajectory datasets of driving vehicles, showing that our method outperforms various baselines and state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Hua Wei","Chacha Chen","Chang Liu","Guanjie Zheng"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-67667-4_32","In book: Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases: Applied Data Science Track (pp.530-545)"],"references":["337017491_CoLight_Learning_Network-level_Cooperation_for_Traffic_Signal_Control","334715234_PressLight_Learning_Max_Pressure_Control_to_Coordinate_Traffic_Signals_in_Arterial_Network","331344124_Joint_Modeling_of_Dense_and_Incomplete_Trajectories_for_Citywide_Traffic_Volume_Inference","326504263_IntelliLight_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_for_Intelligent_Traffic_Light_Control","326203889_Behavioral_Cloning_from_Observation","312760577_Imitating_Driver_Behavior_with_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","305881121_Generative_Adversarial_Imitation_Learning","272521272_Trust_Region_Policy_Optimization","260305214_Calibrating_car-following_parameters_for_snowy_road_conditions_in_the_microscopic_traffic_simulator_VISSIM","259896651_Recent_Development_and_Applications_of_SUMO_-_Simulation_of_Urban_MObility","241633217_Reducing_Uncertainty_of_Low-Sampling-Rate_Trajectories","228692769_Traffic_jams_without_bottlenecks_-_experimental_evidence_for_the_physical_mechanism_of_the_formation_of_a_jam","221606352_Maximum_Entropy_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning","221589740_Map-matching_for_low-sampling-rate_GPS_trajectories","1916918_Calibrating_Car-Following_Models_by_Using_Trajectory_Data_Methodological_Study","341690904_Learning_to_Simulate_Vehicle_Trajectories_from_Demonstrations","341686491_Online_Anomalous_Trajectory_Detection_with_Deep_Generative_Sequence_Modeling","333067562_CityFlow_A_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_Environment_for_Large_Scale_City_Traffic_Scenario","330592166_Multi-Agent_Imitation_Learning_for_Driving_Simulation","330058801_Efficient_calibration_of_microscopic_car-following_models_for_large-scale_stochastic_network_simulators","318810624_Imitating_driver_behavior_with_generative_adversarial_networks","303970230_A_scalable_end-to-end_Gaussian_process_adapter_for_irregularly_sampled_time_series_classification","292093747_Development_and_applications_of_traffic_simulation_models_at_the_karlsruhe_institut_fuer_verkehrswesen","277945276_Trajectory_Data_Mining_An_Overview","245684303_Cognitive_Models_from_Subcognitive_Skills","224795177_Microscopic_Modeling_of_Traffic_Flow_Investigation_of_Collision_Free_Vehicle_Dynamics","2947330_Apprenticeship_Learning_via_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning","2622278_Algorithms_for_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning"]}
