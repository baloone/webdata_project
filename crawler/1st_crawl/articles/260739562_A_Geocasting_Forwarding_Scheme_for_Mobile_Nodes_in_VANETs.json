{"id":"260739562_A_Geocasting_Forwarding_Scheme_for_Mobile_Nodes_in_VANETs","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a geocasting forwarding scheme for mobile nodes in vehicle ad hoc networks. Geocasting is used for sending messages to nodes in a specified area. In this paper, we invest the concept of Fermat point region, a region that the sum of distances of the vertices of the triangle to this region is minimum, to forward packets. The Fermat point regions (FPRs) are used as routing regions to forward data packets to the specified area with the greedy routing algorithm. Performance evaluations show that it can improve the packet transmission efficiency during packet geocasting.","authors":["Tz-Heng Hsu","Ding-Horng Chen","Yi-Hsing Tung"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1109/ISBAST.2013.15","Conference: Biometrics and Security Technologies (ISBAST), 2013 International Symposium on"],"references":["261499543_Adaptive_routing_protocol_for_VANETs_in_city_environments_using_real-time_traffic_information","288963065_A_Cross-Layer_AOMDV_Routing_Protocol_for_V2V_Communication_in_Urban_VANET","224562554_An_improved_AOMDV_routing_protocol_for_V2V_communication","224386044_A_Proposal_of_Link_Metric_for_Next-Hop_Forwarding_Methods_in_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","224177400_An_adaptive_cross-layer_multi-path_routing_protocol_for_urban_VANET","224175447_Fastest-Vehicle_Multi-hop_Routing_in_Vehicular_Ad_hoc_Networks","224123237_Vertex-Based_Multihop_Vehicle-to-Infrastructure_Routing_for_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","221109366_ABSRP_-_A_Service_Discovery_Approach_for_Vehicular_Ad-Hoc_Networks","220271336_Geometry-driven_Scheme_for_Geocast_Routing_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","220133781_Flooding-Based_Geocasting_Protocols_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","4302788_Macro-Level_and_Micro-Level_Routing_MMR_for_Urban_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","3789597_Geocasting_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks_Location-based_multicast_algorithms"]}
