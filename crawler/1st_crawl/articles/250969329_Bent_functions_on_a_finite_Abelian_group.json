{"id":"250969329_Bent_functions_on_a_finite_Abelian_group","abstract":"We introduce the notion of a bent function on a finite Abelian group which in the case of the elementary Abelian 2-group coincides with the well-known notion of a Boolean bent function. Using methods of the theory of characters and commutative harmonic analysis we obtain a number of properties of bent functions which generalize the corresponding properties of Boolean bent functions. We construct some classes of bent functions.","authors":["Oleg Logachev","A. A. SALNIKOV","V. V.
