{"id":"324752674_Privacy-Aware_Multidimensional_Mobile_Service_Quality_Prediction_and_Recommendation_in_Distributed_Fog_Environment","abstract":"With the ever-increasing popularity of mobile computing technology, a wide range of computational resources or services (e.g., movies, food, and places of interest) are migrating to the mobile infrastructure or devices (e.g., mobile phones, PDA, and smart watches), imposing heavy burdens on the service selection decisions of users. In this situation, service recommendation has become one of the promising ways to alleviate such burdens. In general, the service usage data used to make service recommendation are produced by various mobile devices and collected by distributed edge platforms, which leads to potential leakage of user privacy during the subsequent cross-platform data collaboration and service recommendation process. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique has recently been introduced to realize the privacy-preserving distributed service recommendation. However, existing LSH-based recommendation approaches often consider only one quality dimension of services, without considering the multidimensional recommendation scenarios that are more complex but more common. In view of this drawback, we improve the traditional LSH and put forward a novel LSH-based service recommendation approach named SerRecmulti-qos , to protect usersâ€™ privacy over multiple quality dimensions during the distributed mobile service recommendation process.","authors":["Wenwen Gong","Lianyong Qi","Yanwei Xu"],"meta":["April 2018Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 2018(4):1-8","DOI:10.1155/2018/3075849"],"references":["320959906_Singular_integral_equations_of_convolution_type_with_Hilbert_kernel_and_a_discrete_jump_problem","318184563_Adaptive_group_bridge_estimation_for_high-dimensional_partially_linear_models","322521469_Theory_of_rotated_equations_and_applications_to_a_population_model","321638662_Amplified_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing_for_Privacy-Preserving_Distributed_Service_Recommendation","320541235_Two-Phase_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing_for_Privacy-Preserving_Distributed_Service_Recommendation","320261594_A_Distributed_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing-Based_Approach_for_Cloud_Service_Recommendation_From_Multi-Source_Data","320252620_Location-privacy-aware_review_publication_mechanism_for_local_business_service_systems","319637520_Privacy-Preserving_Distributed_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing","319231601_Bifurcation_of_periodic_orbits_by_perturbing_high-dimensional_piecewise_smooth_integrable_systems","316566484_Restricted_profile_estimation_for_partially_linear_models_with_large-dimensional_covariates"]}
