{"id":"271546214_Aplicacao_da_Realidade_Aumentada_para_simulacao_de_experimentos_fisicos_em_dispositivos_moveis","abstract":"This study presents the development experience of a Reality Augmented application and discusses its utility as support tool for physics experiments simulation on mobile devices. The growing popularity of mobile devices provides a wide range of users, such as basic education students, who are the focus of this work. Using the ubiquitous computing and experimentation concepts, we report the development of interactive applications and dynamic learning proposing experimentation through Augmented Reality to support the scientific concepts learning. Moreover, the target operating system and software implementation are open source, in manner to reduce costs and facilitate development.","authors":["A. N. A.
