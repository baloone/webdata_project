{"id":"355180925_Social_status_and_novelty_drove_the_spread_of_online_information_during_the_early_stages_of_COVID-19","abstract":"Access to online information has been crucial throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed more than eight million randomly selected Twitter posts from the first wave of the pandemic to study the role of the authorâ€™s social status (Health Expert or Influencer) and the informational novelty of the tweet in the diffusion of several key types of information. Our results show that health-related information and political discourse propagated faster than personal narratives, economy-related or travel-related news. Content novelty further accelerated the spread of these discussion themes. People trusted health experts on health-related knowledge, especially when it was novel, while influencers were more effective at propagating political discourse. Finally, we observed a U-shaped relationship between the informational novelty and the number of retweets. Tweets with average novelty spread the least. Tweets with high novelty propagated the most, primarily when they discussed political, health, or personal information, perhaps owing to the immediacy to mobilize this information. On the other hand, economic and travel-related information spread most when it was less novel, and people resisted sharing such information before it was duly verified.","authors":["Antonis Photiou","Christos Nicolaides","Paramveer Dhillon"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):20098","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-99060-y"],"references":["354794601_Social_media_conversations_reveal_large_psychological_shifts_caused_by_COVID-19's_onset_across_US_cities","349486657_An_exploratory_study_of_COVID-19_misinformation_on_Twitter","348210671_The_Social_and_Psychological_Changes_of_the_First_Months_of_COVID-19","344949844_Assessing_the_risks_of_'infodemics'_in_response_to_COVID-19_epidemics","341361980_Global_sentiments_surrounding_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_Twitter","341159470_Evidence_from_internet_search_data_shows_information-seeking_responses_to_news_of_local_COVID-19_cases","340658737_COVID-19_infodemic_More_retweets_for_science-based_information_on_coronavirus_than_for_false_information","353355261_Beliefs_about_COVID-19_in_Canada_the_UK_and_the_USA_A_novel_test_of_political_polarization_and_motivated_reasoning","347235230_Quantifying_the_Effects_of_COVID-19_on_Mental_Health_Support_Forums","343336853_Interdependence_and_the_cost_of_uncoordinated_responses_to_COVID-19","340502400_Types_Sources_and_Claims_of_COVID-19_Misinformation","339923047_Coronavirus_Goes_Viral_Quantifying_the_COVID-19_Misinformation_Epidemic_on_Twitter","339757623_The_effect_of_travel_restrictions_on_the_spread_of_the_2019_novel_coronavirus_COVID-19_outbreak","334168754_Likes_retweets_and_polarization","323649207_The_spread_of_true_and_false_news_online"]}
