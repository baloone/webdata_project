{"id":"328248524_Femtosecond_laser-inscribed_harsh_environment_fiber_bragg_grating_sensors","abstract":"With the increasing need for health monitoring in structures such as bridges, tunnels, dams, highways, aircraft wings, and spacecraft fuel tanks, it is critical to develop effective sensor networks, which can measure strain, pressure, and temperature. Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) have the advantages of high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and wavelength division multiplexing capability. Thus, they have been widely investigated as effective sensing elements since their first demonstration in the sensing application by Meltz et al.","authors":["S. Yin","C. Zhan","P.B.
