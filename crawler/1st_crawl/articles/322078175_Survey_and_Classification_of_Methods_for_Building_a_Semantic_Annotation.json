{"id":"322078175_Survey_and_Classification_of_Methods_for_Building_a_Semantic_Annotation","abstract":"Though Arabic is one of the five most spoken languages, little work has been done on building Arabic semantic resources. Currently, there is no agreed-upon method for building such a reliable Arabic semantic resource. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of different methods for building or enriching Arabic semantic resources; to study and analyze each method; and to categorize the methods according to their properties. This work should contribute to the definition of new methods and help researchers on Arabic semantics to fit their work in the panel of existing ones.","authors":["George Lebbos","Abed Hajjar","Gilles Bernard","Mohammad Hajjar"],"meta":["December 2017International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 8(12)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2017.081264"],"references":["280851488_WordNet_et_son_ecosysteme_un_ensemble_de_ressources_linguistiques_de_large_couverture","280254877_Using_an_Arabic_Ontology_to_Improve_the_QA_Task","280253920_Amine_une_plate-forme_pour_le_developpement_de_systemes_et_d'agents_intelligents","280044822_Constitution_d'une_ressource_semantique_arabe_a_partir_de_corpus_multilingue_aligne","257547335_Erratum_to_On_the_evaluation_and_improvement_of_Arabic_WordNet_coverage_and_usability","256537362_Arabase_A_Database_Combining_Different_Arabic_Resources_with_Lexical_and_Semantic_Information","321064783_Towards_the_Enrichment_of_Arabic_WordNet_with_Big_Corpora","305404956_Arabic_WordNet_New_Content_and_New_Applications","288038524_An_Analysis_of_Ontologies_and_their_Success_Factors_for_Application_to_Business","266358043_AraSeg_un_segmenteur_semi-automatique_des_textes_arabes","230585377_EuroWordNet_A_Multilingual_Database_of_Autonomous_and_Language-specific_Wordnets_Connected_via_an_Inter-Lingual-Index","228980241_Using_the_Yago_ontology_as_a_resource_for_the_enrichment_of_Named_Entities_in_Arabic_WordNet","228848243_Ontologies_in_Amine_Platform_Structures_and_Processes","228527520_Improving_QA_Using_Arabic_Wordnet","228737483_Automatically_extending_ne_coverage_of_arabic_wordnet_using_wikipedia"]}
