However, a completely different situation can be observed abroad, where, for many years, prominent experts have been making proposals to change the concept of teaching so that pupils are not only educated to become active technology users, but are also encouraged to try to devise their own procedures, propose tools for solving specific problems and develop the so-called computational thinking. So, what does the specific educational content of IT subjects at the 1st and 2nd stage of Czech primary schools look like? Which IT topics are actually taught? Are there any topics in teaching that are not embedded or accentuated in the curriculum documents? We will try to answer these questions in the submitted paper, which presents some partial outputs of the conducted research focused primarily on the issue of the acceptance of educational content of IT subjects taught at primary schools.","authors":["Milan Klement"],"meta":["August 2021","DOI:10.33543/1101_klement","Project: ICT versus teachers: adoration or resistence?"],"references":["345183113_Perception_and_Possibilities_of_ICT_Tools_in_the_Education_from_the_Teachers'_Perspective","340375234_Mapping_Digital_Competence_Towards_a_Conceptual_Understanding","330412908_Vybrane_vysledky_vyzkumu_rozvoje_digitalnich_kompetenci_zaku_na_ZS","284085761_On_the_philosophical_foundations_of_psychological_measurement","282860020_DIGCOMP_a_Framework_for_Developing_and_Understanding_Digital_Competence_in_Europe","275532027_ICT_Competencies_and_their_Development_in_Primary_and_Lower-secondary_Schools_in_the_Czech_Republic","274309848_Computational_Thinking","220283690_Characterization_and_evaluation_of_similarity_measures_for_pairs_of_clusterings","344517843_Tvorba_kurikularnich_dokumentu_v_Ceske_republice_historicko-analyticky_pohled_na_pripravu_kurikularnich_dokumentu_pro_zakladni_vzdelavani_v_letech_1989-2013","308836584_Teaching_research_and_practice_of_blended_leaning_model_based_on_computational_thinking","40332396_Uloha_skoly_v_rozvoji_vzdelanosti"]}
