{"id":"282844130_Unbounded_randomness_certification_using_sequences_of_measurements","abstract":"Unpredictability, or randomness, of the outcomes of measurements made on an\nentangled state can be certified provided that the statistics violate a Bell\ninequality. In the standard Bell scenario where each party performs a single\nmeasurement on its share of the system, only a finite amount of at most $4\nlog_2 d$ bits of randomness can be certified from a pair of qudits. In our\nwork, it is shown that this fundamental limitation can be overcome using\nsequences of (non-projective) measurements on the same system. More precisely,\nwe prove that one can certify any amount of random bits from a pair of qubits\nin a pure state as resource, even if it is arbitrarily weakly entangled. In\naddition, this certification is achieved by near-maximal violation of a\nparticular Bell inequality for each measurement in the sequence.","authors":["Florian Curchod","Markus Johansson","Remigiusz Augusiak","Matty J.
