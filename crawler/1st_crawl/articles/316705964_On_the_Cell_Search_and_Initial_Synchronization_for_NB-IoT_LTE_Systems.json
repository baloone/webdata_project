{"id":"316705964_On_the_Cell_Search_and_Initial_Synchronization_for_NB-IoT_LTE_Systems","abstract":"In Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) LTE systems, the device shall be able to blindly lock to a cell within 200 KHz bandwidth and with only one receive antenna. In addition, the device is required to setup a call at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of -12.6 dB in the extended coverage mode. New set of synchronization signals have been introduced to provide data-aided synchronization and cell search. In this paper, we present a procedure for NB-IoT cell search and initial synchronization subject to the new challenges given the new specifications. Simulation results show that this method does not only provide the required performance at very low SNRs, but also it can be quickly camp on a cell, if any.","authors":["Abdelmohsen Ali","Walaa Hamouda"],"meta":["May 2017IEEE Communications Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2700864"],"references":["303969949_A_Primer_on_3GPP_Narrowband_Internet_of_Things_NB-IoT","296479892_New_3GPP_Standard_for_IoT_Mobile_Radio","254056899_Neighboring_Cell_Search_for_LTE_Systems","251986101_Complexity_effective_cell_search_scheme_for_OFDM_cellular_system","251985457_An_area-efficient_implementation_of_Primary_Synchronization_Signal_detection_in_LTE","224084771_SSS_detection_method_for_initial_cell_search_in_3GPP_LTE_FDDTDD_dual_mode_receiver"]}
