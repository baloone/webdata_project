Here we elucidate the functional significance of these novel microRNAs. Of the seven microRNAs, over expression of miRNA-6852 (miR-SX4) mimic induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induces necrosis in HEK293 and panel of cervical cancer cells (Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infected cell lines; HeLa, CaSki and SiHa cells). To define the mechanism of the miR-SX4-mediated G2/M arrest, a microarray gene chip array and western blot analysis were performed. FoxM1, a transcription factor is identified as a key protein down-regulated by miR-SX4, even though the miR-SX4 does not target 3'UTR of FoxM1. Knock down of FoxM1 using si-RNA demonstrate that FoxM1 silenced cell induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and necrosis. Our data demonstrated for the first time that miR-SX4 could be a potent anti-cancer microRNA.","authors":["Deepak Poudyal","Andrew Herman","Joseph W.
