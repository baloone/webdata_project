Physiol.116, 424–448; Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952,J. Physiol.116, 449–566). Its general object is to discuss the results of the preceding papers (Section 1), to put them into mathematical form (Section 2) and to show that they will account for conduction and excitation in quantitative terms (Sections 3–6).","authors":["A.
