{"id":"340356472_A_multi-stage_stochastic_integer_programming_approach_for_a_multi-echelon_lot-sizing_problem_with_returns_and_lost_sales","abstract":"We consider an uncapacitated multi-item multi-echelon lot-sizing problem within a remanufacturing system involving three production echelons: disassembly, refurbishing and reassembly. We seek to plan the production activities on this system over a multi-period horizon. We consider a stochastic environment, in which the input data of the optimization problem are subject to uncertainty. We propose a multi-stage stochastic integer programming approach relying on scenario trees to represent the uncertain information structure and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm in order to solve the resulting mixed-integer linear program to optimality. This algorithm relies on a new set of tree inequalities obtained by combining valid inequalities previously known for each individual scenario of the scenario tree. These inequalities are used within a cutting-plane generation procedure based on a heuristic resolution of the corresponding separation problem. Computational experiments carried out on randomly generated instances show that the proposed branch-and-cut algorithm performs well as compared to the use of a stand-alone mathematical solver. Finally, rolling horizon simulations are carried out to assess the practical performance of the multi-stage stochastic planning model with respect to a deterministic model and a two-stage stochastic planning model.","authors":["Franco Quezada","CÃ©line Gicquel","Safia Kedad-Sidhoum","Dong Quan Vu"],"meta":["April 2020Computers & Operations Research 116(22)","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2019.104865"],"references":["315369024_A_stochastic_production_planning_problem_in_hybrid_manufacturing_and_remanufacturing_systems_with_resource_capacity_planning","299575444_Capacitated_dynamic_production_and_remanufacturing_planning_under_demand_and_return_uncertainty","279763268_Hybrid_manufacturing_and_remanufacturing_lot-sizing_problem_with_stochastic_demand_return_and_setup_costs","232879513_Production_planning_and_control_for_remanufacturing_Literature_review_and_analysis_Production_planning_control","224584419_Multiperiod_Remanufacturing_Planning_With_Uncertain_Quality_of_Inputs","220589867_A_Branch-and-Cut_algorithm_for_the_stochastic_uncapacitated_lot-sizing_problem","220244415_Cutting_Planes_for_Multistage_Stochastic_Integer_Programs","23977370_The_uncapacitated_lot-sizing_problem_with_sales_and_safety_stocks","347398734_Production_planning_and_control_for_remanufacturing_industry_practice_and_research_needs","322225740_Heuristic_policies_for_the_stochastic_economic_lot_sizing_problem_with_remanufacturing_under_service_level_constraints","268237653_A_MIP-Based_Heuristic_for_the_Stochastic_Economic_Lot_Sizing_Problem_with_Remanufacturing","267763798_A_Branch-and-Cut_Method_for_Dynamic_Decision_Making_Under_Joint_Chance_Constraints","263732331_A_two-stage_robust_programming_approach_to_demand-driven_disassembly_planning_for_a_closed-loop_supply_chain_system","257581232_Production_planning_optimization_for_manufacturing_and_remanufacturing_system_in_stochastic_environment","245331482_A_stochastic_dynamic_programming_based_model_for_uncertain_production_planning_of_re-manufacturing_system","245331129_Production_planning_for_closed-loop_supply_chains_with_product_recovery_and_reuse_An_analytical_approach","245190299_Production_Planning_and_Control_for_Remanufacturing_A_State-of-the-Art_Survey","239395955_Multi-item_capacitated_lot-sizing_with_demand_uncertainty","233358621_Solution_algorithms_for_dynamic_lot-sizing_in_remanufacturing_systems","228385295_A_multi-stage_stochastic_programming_approach_for_production_planning_with_uncertainty_in_the_quality_of_raw_materials_and_demand","222567588_Lot-sizing_on_a_tree","222548315_Production_Planning_and_Control_for_Remanufacturing_Industry_Practice_and_Research_Needs","38032833_Environmentally_Conscious_Manufacturing_and_Product_Recovery_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Art"]}
