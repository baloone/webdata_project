{"id":"282716825_Development_of_a_person_counting_system_using_a_3D_laser_scanner","abstract":"The purpose of the present study is to develop a person counting system using a 3D laser scanner. The system consists of a person-detection component, a tracking component, and a counting component. The person-detection component detects human bodies as a point cloud, even if a number of people are close to each other. To achieve this, we use a method of grouping the point cloud towards the bottom from the top. The tracking component tracks the detected person using a Kalman filter. The counting component counts the number of people who enter and exit a structure. Experimental results obtained in the present study reveal that the proposed system can recognize individual pedestrians and count the number of people passing through crowded outdoor environments.","authors":["Shun-ichi Akamatsu","Naohiro Shimaji","Tetsuo Tomizawa"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090627"],"references":["224829348_Human_Sensing_in_Crowd_Using_Laser_Scanners","286672736_Development_of_Intelligent_Automatic_Door_System","221262364_Automatic_Counting_of_Interacting_People_by_using_a_Single_Uncalibrated_Camera","3884560_Person_counting_using_stereo","3835235_A_method_of_counting_the_passing_people_by_using_the_stereo_images"]}
