{"id":"274902604_Faster_Algorithms_for_the_Constrained_k-means_Problem","abstract":"The classical center based clustering problems such as\n$k$-means/median/center assume that the optimal clusters satisfy the locality\nproperty that the points in the same cluster are close to each other. A number\nof clustering problems arise in machine learning where the optimal clusters do\nnot follow such a locality property. Consider a variant of the $k$-means\nproblem that may be regarded as a general version of such problems. Here, the\noptimal clusters $O_1, ..., O_k$ are an arbitrary partition of the dataset and\nthe goal is to output $k$-centers $c_1, ..., c_k$ such that the objective\nfunction $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in O_{i}} ||x - c_{i}||^2$ is minimized. It\nis not difficult to argue that any algorithm (without knowing the optimal\nclusters) that outputs a single set of $k$ centers, will not behave well as far\nas optimizing the above objective function is concerned. However, this does not\nrule out the existence of algorithms that output a list of such $k$ centers\nsuch that at least one of these $k$ centers behaves well. Given an error\nparameter $\\varepsilon > 0$, let $\\ell$ denote the size of the smallest list of\n$k$-centers such that at least one of the $k$-centers gives a $(1+\\varepsilon)$\napproximation w.r.t. the objective function above. In this paper, we show an\nupper bound on $\\ell$ by giving a randomized algorithm that outputs a list of\n$2^{\\tilde{O}(k/\\varepsilon)}$ $k$-centers. We also give a closely matching\nlower bound of $2^{\\tilde{\\Omega}(k/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})}$. Moreover, our\nalgorithm runs in time $O \\left(n d \\cdot 2^{\\tilde{O}(k/\\varepsilon)}\n\\right)$. This is a significant improvement over the previous result of Ding\nand Xu who gave an algorithm with running time $O \\left(n d \\cdot (\\log{n})^{k}\n\\cdot 2^{poly(k/\\varepsilon)} \\right)$ and output a list of size $O\n\\left((\\log{n})^k \\cdot 2^{poly(k/\\varepsilon)} \\right)$.","authors":["Anup Bhattacharya","Ragesh Jaiswal","Amit Kumar"],"meta":["January 2018Theory of Computing Systems 62(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-017-9820-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259742996_Improved_analysis_of_D2-sampling_based_PTAS_for_k-means_and_other_Clustering_problems","234804011_Applications_of_weighted_Voronoi_diagrams_and_randomization_to_variance-based-clustering","220984093_Applications_of_Weighted_Voronoi_Diagrams_and_Randomization_to_Variance-Based","220983821_A_PTAS_for_k-means_clustering_based_on_weak_coresets","220431812_Linear-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Clustering_Problems_in_Any_Dimensions","300766404_A_Unified_Framework_for_Clustering_Constrained_Data_without_Locality_Property","243183177_On_k-Median_clustering_in_high_dimensions","227273551_On_Approximate_Geometric_k-Clustering","221591411_Approximation_schemes_for_clustering_problems","221591136_On_coresets_for_k-means_and_k-median_clustering","220390396_Clustering_for_Metric_and_Nonmetric_Distance_Measures","51990674_A_Simple_D_2-Sampling_Based_PTAS_for_k-Means_and_other_Clustering_Problems","2913205_Approximate_Clustering_via_Core-Sets"]}
