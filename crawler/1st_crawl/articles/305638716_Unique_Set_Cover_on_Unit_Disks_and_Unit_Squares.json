{"id":"305638716_Unique_Set_Cover_on_Unit_Disks_and_Unit_Squares","abstract":"We study the Unique Set Cover problem on unit disks and unit squares. For a given set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $D$ of $m$ geometric objects both in the plane, the objective of the Unique Set Cover problem is to select a subset $D'\\subseteq D$ of objects such that every point in $P$ is covered by at least one object in $D'$ and the number of points covered uniquely is maximized, where a point is covered uniquely if the point is covered by exactly one object in $D'$. In this paper, (i) we show that the Unique Set Cover is NP-hard on both unit disks and unit squares, and (ii) we give a PTAS for this problem on unit squares by applying the mod-one approach of Chan and Hu (Comput. Geom. 48(5), 2015).","authors":["Saeed Mehrabi"],"meta":["July 2016"],"references":["30508708_Fixed-Location_Circular-Arc_Drawing_of_Planar_Graphs","281704228_A_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Geometric_Unique_Coverage_Problem_on_Unit_Squares","278393843_A_431-Approximation_for_the_Geometric_Unique_Coverage_Problem_on_Unit_Disks","269724665_Geometric_red-blue_set_cover_for_unit_squares_and_related_problems","254852858_Optimization_and_approximation_on_systems_of_geometric_objects","221462647_PTAS_for_Weighted_Set_Cover_on_Unit_Squares","220779848_Approximating_geometric_coverage_problems","220779231_Combination_Can_Be_Hard_Approximability_of_the_Unique_Coverage_Problem","220452184_Improved_Results_on_Geometric_Hitting_Set_Problems","220432249_Approximation_Schemes_for_Covering_and_Packing_Problems_in_Image_Processing_and_VLSI","50305747_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Pseudo-Disks","1880314_The_Problem_of_Compatible_Representatives"]}
