{"id":"326592454_Parameterized_complexity_of_machine_scheduling_15_open_problems","abstract":"Machine scheduling problems are a long-time key domain of algorithms and complexity research. A novel approach to machine scheduling problems are fixed-parameter algorithms. To stimulate this thriving research direction, we propose 15 open questions in this area whose resolution we expect to lead to the discovery of new approaches and techniques both in scheduling and parameterized complexity theory.","authors":["Matthias Mnich","Ren√© van Bevern"],"meta":["July 2018Computers & Operations Research 100","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2018.07.020","Project: Parameterized approaches to scheduling problems"],"references":["342122158_Wireless_Scheduling_Graph_Classes_and_c-Colorable_Subgraphs","319895140_New_Algorithms_for_Minimizing_the_Weighted_Number_of_Tardy_Jobs_On_a_Single_Machine","319700687_On_The_Parameterized_Tractability_of_the_Just-In-Time_Flow-Shop_Scheduling_Problem","317101064_Combinatorial_n-fold_Integer_Programming_and_Applications","315874889_A_parameterized_approximation_algorithm_for_the_mixed_and_windy_capacitated_arc_routing_problem_Theory_and_experiments","313852592_Parameterized_and_approximation_results_for_scheduling_with_a_low_rank_processing_time_matrix","344846036_Scheduling_and_fixed-parameter_tractability","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","316113637_Structural_Parameters_for_Scheduling_with_Assignment_Restrictions","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms"]}
