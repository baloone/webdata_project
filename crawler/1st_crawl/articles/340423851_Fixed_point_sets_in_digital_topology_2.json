{"id":"340423851_Fixed_point_sets_in_digital_topology_2","abstract":"We continue the work of [10], studying properties of digital images determined by fixed point invariants. We introduce pointed versions of invariants that were introduced in [10]. We introduce freezing sets and cold sets to show how the existence of a fixed point set for a continuous self-map restricts the map on the complement of the fixed point set.","authors":["Laurence Boxer"],"meta":["April 2020Applied General Topology 21(1):111","DOI:10.4995/agt.2020.12101"],"references":["340425907_Fixed_point_sets_in_digital_topology_1","312091386_Alternate_Product_Adjacencies_in_Digital_Topology","306186519_Generalized_Normal_Product_Adjacency_in_Digital_Topology","301857077_Fundamental_Groups_and_Euler_Characteristics_of_Sphere-like_Digital_Images","279968212_Digital_Fixed_Points_Approximate_Fixed_Points_and_Universal_Functions","277648964_Homotopy_Equivalence_in_Finite_Digital_Images","324461217_Digital_Topology","236176949_Fundamental_Groups_for_Digital_Products","223704833_'Continuous'_functions_on_digital_pictures","222479916_Digitally_continuous_functions"]}
