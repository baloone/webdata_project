{"id":"282254900_Light-hierarchy_for_provisioning_multiple_multicast_requests_in_sparse_splitting_WDM_networks","abstract":"We consider the problem of provisioning multiple multicast requests in WDM networks simultaneously. We aims at minimizing the number of wavelengths used while satisfying all the requests. Instead of using the traditional light-trees, we propose to use the light-hierarchy structure to route multicast requests, which permits more flexible routes and thus enables us to reduce and/or balance the usage of network resources. A coupled adaptive heuristic algorithm that integrates both routing and wavelength assignment in one step is proposed to compute the approximate solutions for this NP-hard problem. The simulation results show that it is more advantageous to provision multiple multicast communications using light-hierarchies since they are able to save up to 10% wavelength usage compared to light-trees. We also conduct other simulations to verify the advantage of adaptive approach over static one in terms of resource consumption.","authors":["Le Dinh Danh","Fen Zhou","Miklos Molnar"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069456","Conference: 2015 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications, ICNC 2015"],"references":["268008030_Hierarchies_to_Solve_Constrained_Connected_Spanning_Problems","288350416_A_Pratical_Appproach_for_Routing_and_Wavelength_Assignment_in_Large_Wavelength-Routed_Optical_Networks","273621227_Cisco_Visual_Networking_Index_Forecast_adn_Methodology_2013_-_2018","263766135_Cost-Effective_Implementation_of_Multicasting_in_Wavelength-Routed_Networks","243782978_Connection_management_for_survivable_wavelength-routed_WDM_mesh_networks","242327080_An_approximate_solution_of_the_Steiner_problem_in_graphs","241171214_Routing_and_wavelength_assignment_computed_jointly_for_a_given_set_of_multicast_trees_reduces_the_total_wavelength_conversion","226921679_Layered-routing_approach_for_solving_multicast_routing_and_wavelength_assignment_problem","226637838_Virtual_Source_Based_Multicast_Routing_in_WDM_Optical_Networks","226234189_Allocation_of_Splitting_Nodes_in_All-Optical_Wavelength-Routed_Networks"]}
