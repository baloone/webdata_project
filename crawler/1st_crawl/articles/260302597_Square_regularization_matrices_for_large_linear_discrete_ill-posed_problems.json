{"id":"260302597_Square_regularization_matrices_for_large_linear_discrete_ill-posed_problems","abstract":"Large linear discrete ill-posed problems with contaminated data are often solved with the aid of Tikhonov regularization. Commonly used regularization matrices are finite difference approximations of a suitable derivative and are rectangular. This paper discusses the design of square regularization matrices that can be used in iterative methods based on the Arnoldi process for large-scale Tikhonov regularization problems.","authors":["Marco Donatelli","Arthur Neuman","Lothar Reichel"],"meta":["December 2012Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications 19(6)","DOI:10.1002/nla.1833"],"references":["251484046_Large-scale_Tikhonov_regularization_via_reduction_by_orthogonal_projection","228956429_An_iterative_method_for_Tikhonov_regularization_with_a_general_linear_regularization_operator","228350681_Greedy_Tikhonov_regularization_for_large_linear_ill-posed_problems","226982475_Orthogonal_projection_regularization_operators","225983965_A_weighted_pseudoinverse_generalized_singular_values_and_constrained_least_squares_problems","220393744_Algorithms_for_range_restricted_iterative_methods_for_linear_discrete_ill-posed_problems","344551018_Computational_Methods_for_Integral_Equations","266732088_Matrix_Computations","261987212_Computational_Method_for_Integral_Equations","256476658_Rank-Deficient_and_Discrete_III-Posed_Problems_Numerical_Aspects_of_Linear_Inversion","243782885_Regularization_Methods_for_Large-Scale_Problems","243083790_The_Use_of_Auto-correlation_for_Pseudo-rank_Determination_in_Noisy_III-conditioned_Linear_Least-squares_Problems","242944123_Multiparameter_regularization_techniques_for_ill-conditioned_linear_systems","235890194_Regularization_of_Inverse_Problem","234814397_Invertible_smoothing_preconditioners_for_linear_discrete_ill-posed_problems","228896062_Discrete_ill-posed_least-squares_problems_with_a_solution_norm_constraint","228869692_Implementations_of_range_restricted_iterative_methods_for_linear_discrete_ill-posed_problems","228336917_Simple_square_smoothing_regularization_operators","226357761_A_bidiagonalization_algorithm_for_solving_large_and_sparse_ill-posed_systems_of_linear_equations","222404583_Arnoldi-Tikhonov_regularization_methods","220656453_Smoothing-Norm_Preconditioning_for_Regularizing_Minimum-Residual_Methods","220431913_A_Technique_for_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Certain_Integral_Equations_of_the_First_Kind","220411615_A_Projection-Based_Approach_to_General-Form_Tikhonov_Regularization","220393837_Regularization_tools_version_40_for_MATLAB_73","34901803_Numerical_Methods_for_Least_Squares_Problems","2834604_Estimation_of_the_L-Curve_via_Lanczos_Bidiagonalization"]}
