{"id":"309005658_MLearning_and_pre-service_teachers_An_assessment_of_the_behavioral_intention_using_an_expanded_TAM_model","abstract":"This paper presents the results of a study conducted in the University of Salamanca, on the behavioral intention of using mobile devices within the future teaching practice of pre-service primary education teachers. To this end we elaborated a technology adoption model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), to which we incorporated the constructs of self-efficacy and mobile anxiety. The study consisted of 678 participants from the Primary Education Teacher Bachelor's Degree at said university.","authors":["José Carlos Sánchez-Prieto","Susana Olmos","Francisco José
