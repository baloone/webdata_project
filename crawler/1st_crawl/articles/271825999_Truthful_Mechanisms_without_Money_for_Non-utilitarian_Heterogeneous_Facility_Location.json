{"id":"271825999_Truthful_Mechanisms_without_Money_for_Non-utilitarian_Heterogeneous_Facility_Location","abstract":"n this paper, we consider the facility location problem un-\nder a novel model recently proposed in the literature, which\ncombines the no-money constraint (i.e. the impossibility to\nemploy monetary transfers between the mechanism and the\nagents) with the presence of heterogeneous facilities, i.e. fa-\ncilities serving different purposes. Agents thus have a signif-\nicantly different cost model w.r.t. the classical model with\nhomogeneous facilities studied in literature. We initiate the\nstudy of non-utilitarian optimization functions under this\nnovel model. In particular, we consider the case where the op-\ntimization goal consists of minimizing the maximum connec-\ntion cost of the agents. In this setting, we investigate both de-\nterministic and randomized algorithms and derive both lower\nand upper bounds regarding the approximability of strate-\ngyproof mechanisms.","authors":["Paolo Serafino","Carmine Ventre"],"meta":["January 2015","Conference: AAAI 2015"],"references":["267390246_Heterogeneous_Facility_Location_without_Money_on_the_Line","257246600_Combinatorial_Auctions_Without_Money","254005952_Mechanism_design_on_discrete_lines_and_cycles","228115487_On_the_Power_of_Deterministic_Mechanisms_for_Facility_Location_Games","226038155_On_Strategy-Proofness_and_Single_Peakedness","222403517_Strategy-proof_Location_on_a_Network","221445084_Approximate_Mechanism_Design_without_Money","221256571_Scheduling_Without_Payments","220853203_Tighter_Bounds_for_Facility_Games","220442825_Strategyproof_Approximation_of_the_Minimax_on_Networks"]}
