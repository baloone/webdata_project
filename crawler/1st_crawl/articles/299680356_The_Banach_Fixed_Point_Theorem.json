{"id":"299680356_The_Banach_Fixed_Point_Theorem","abstract":"This chapter is devoted to the Banach fixed point theorem and some of its immediate consequences. In particular, we shall prove the usual version of the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces and present some applications to boundary value problems. This requires knowing the basic notions of differentiation in Banach spaces, which, for the readerâ€™s convenience, are presented here.","authors":["Pablo Amster"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-8893-4_2","In book: Topological Methods in the Study of Boundary Value Problems (pp.29-51)"],"references":["226602126_A_simple_proof_of_the_Banach_contraction_principle","26842119_The_contraction_mapping_principle_and_some_applications","269005596_Monotone_Approximations_and_Rapid_Convergence","265372694_Sur_l'application_des_methodes_d'approximations_successives_a_l'etude_de_certaines_equations_differentielles_ordinaires","248426320_What_the_tortoise_said_to_achilles_and_other_riddles","243450076_Sur_les_Oprations_dans_les_Ensembles_Abstraits_et_leurs_Applications_aux_Equations_Intgrales","31717655_The_Implicit_Function_Theorem_History_Theory_and_Applications_SG_Krantz_HR_Parks","7200121_Nonexpansive_Nonlinear_Operators_in_a_Banach_Space"]}
