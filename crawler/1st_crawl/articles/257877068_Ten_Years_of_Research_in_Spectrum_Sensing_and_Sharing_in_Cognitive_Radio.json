{"id":"257877068_Ten_Years_of_Research_in_Spectrum_Sensing_and_Sharing_in_Cognitive_Radio","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) can successfully deal with the growing demand and scarcity of the wireless spectrum. To exploit limited spectrum efficiently, CR technology allows unlicensed users to access licensed spectrum bands. Since licensed users have priorities to use the bands, the unlicensed users need to continuously monitor the licensed users' activities to avoid interference and collisions. How to obtain reliable results of the licensed users' activities is the main task for spectrum sensing. Based on the sensing results, the unlicensed users should adapt their transmit powers and access strategies to protect the licensed communications. The requirement naturally presents challenges to the implementation of CR. In this article, we provide an overview of recent research achievements of including spectrum sensing, sharing techniques and the applications of CR systems.","authors":["lu lu","Xiangwei Zhou","Uzoma Onunkwo","Geoffrey Li"],"meta":["December 2012EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2012(1)","DOI:10.1186/1687-1499-2012-28"],"references":["260508397_Optimal_Multiband_Joint_Detection_for_Spectrum_Sensing_in_Cognitive_Radio_Networks","306202752_Public_safety_and_emergency_case_communications_Opportunities_from_the_aspect_of_cognitive_radio","305114036_Brain-empowered_wireless_communications","257671837_Cognitive_radio_methods_for_the_detection_of_free_bands","254059639_ProSpect_A_Proactive_Spectrum_Handoff_Framework_for_Cognitive_Radio_Ad_Hoc_Networks_without_Common_Control_Channel","251953237_Cooperative_Amplify-and-Forward_relaying_in_cognitive_radio_networks","247933056_Cognitive_Radio_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","241230280_Downlink_Channel_Assignment_and_Power_Control_for_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_Using_Game_Theory","239764545_Cooperative_spectrum_sensing_for_primary_user_detection_in_cognitive_radio","228959630_Some_Fundamental_Limits_on_Cognitive_Radio"]}
