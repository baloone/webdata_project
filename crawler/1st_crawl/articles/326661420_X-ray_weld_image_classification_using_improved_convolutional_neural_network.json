{"id":"326661420_X-ray_weld_image_classification_using_improved_convolutional_neural_network","abstract":"The defect detection of X-ray weld images is an effective method to improve product quality and safety. Due to the low contrast of the image, the way of using traditional feature extraction and machine learning has low accuracy. In this paper, combined theory with practice, the technique based on improved convolutional neural network is proposed to classify X-ray weld images. In comparison with conventional methods, it avoids de-noising, extracting and enhancing features. Experimental results on the images obtained from the actual production show that the introduced method has superior accuracy of the classification.","authors":["Nana Yang","Haijun Niu","Liang Chen","Guihua Mi"],"meta":["July 2018AIP Conference Proceedings 1995(1):020035","DOI:10.1063/1.5048766","Conference: 2018 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MECHANICS, STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS SCIENCE (MSMS 2018)"],"references":["308834365_Analysis_of_function_of_rectified_linear_unit_used_in_deep_learning","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","277411157_Deep_Learning","235671258_Welding_Defect_Detection_and_Classification_Using_Geometric_Features","314596453_Toward_an_optimal_convolutional_neural_network_for_traffic_sign_recognition","308846031_Recurrent_convolutional_neural_network_for_object_recognition","280211869_Weld_Defect_Detection_of_X-ray_Images_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machine","223601063_Real-time_arc-welding_defect_detection_and_classification_with_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks"]}
