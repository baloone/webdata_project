{"id":"346481113_Color_image_encryption_based_on_chaotic_compressed_sensing_and_two-dimensional_fractional_Fourier_transform","abstract":"Combining the advantages of structured random measurement matrix and chaotic structure, this paper introduces a color image encryption algorithm based on a structural chaotic measurement matrix and random phase mask. The Chebyshev chaotic sequence is used in the algorithm to generate the flip permutation matrix, the sampling subset and the chaotic cyclic matrix for constructing the structure perceptual matrix and the random phase mask. The original image is compressed and encrypted simultaneously by compressed sensing, and re-encrypted by two-dimensional fractional Fourier transform. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm.","authors":["Xingyuan Wang","Yining Su"],"meta":["October 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-75562-z"],"references":["342237810_A_new_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_coupling_map_lattices_with_mixed_multi-chaos","345648723_Double-image_compression_and_encryption_algorithm_based_on_co-sparse_representation_and_random_pixel_exchanging","344961587_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing","342427293_Adaptive_Payload_Distribution_in_Multiple_Images_Steganography_Based_on_Image_Texture_Features","342340354_Image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_the_matrix_semi-tensor_product_with_a_compound_secret_key_produced_by_a_Boolean_network","341996451_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Chaotic_Sub-Block_Scrambling_and_Chaotic_Digit_Selection_Diffusion","336181028_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_compressive_sensing_and_hyperchaotic_map","335501611_A_Novel_Chaos_Based_Optical_Image_Encryption_Using_fractional_Fourier_transform_and_DNA_Sequence_Operation","335212164_Image_encryption_algorithm_for_synchronously_updating_Boolean_networks_based_on_matrix_semi-tensor_product_theory","334140462_An_image_compression_and_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing"]}
