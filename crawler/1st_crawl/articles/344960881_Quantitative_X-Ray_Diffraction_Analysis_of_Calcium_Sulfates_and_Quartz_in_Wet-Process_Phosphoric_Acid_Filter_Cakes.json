{"id":"344960881_Quantitative_X-Ray_Diffraction_Analysis_of_Calcium_Sulfates_and_Quartz_in_Wet-Process_Phosphoric_Acid_Filter_Cakes","abstract":"A quantitative X-ray diffraction method has been developed for rapid determination of the crystalline phases present in by-product filter cakes from wet-process phosphoric acid manufacture. A new technique to reduce preferred orientation of the crystallites by removing the top layer of the X-ray samples with adhesive tape is described, statistical analysis of synthetic sample mixtures of CaS0 4 .2H 2 O, CaSO 4 · 0.5H 2 0, CaSo 4 , and α-Si0 2 indicates that the calcium sulfate phases present in typical filter cakes can be determined with an accuracy of about 3% at the 95% confidence level; quartz can be determined at about 14%. The method has been applied to the analysis of 10 filter-cake samples from an experimental hemihydrate plant. The results are in good agreement with data from X-ray fluorescence and chemical analyses","authors":["Kjell R.
