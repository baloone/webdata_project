{"id":"324278932_Biometric_student_registration_and_verification_system","abstract":"This project work is devoted to present a biometric identification system based on fingerprint recognition. Biometrics can be taken literally as 'life measurement' but the term is usually associated with the measurement and use of unique physiological characteristics to identify an individual person. Biometric Identification Systems are widely used for unique identification and verification of humans. At present, there are many types of biometric technology have been used; such as, fingerprint recognition, face recognition, voice recognition, iris recognition, etc. Fingerprint recognition is considered to be the best and fastest method for biometric identification. The biometric fingerprints features are secure to use, unique for every person and do not change in one's lifetime. The aim of this project is to develop a fingerprint recognition system that can accurately identify the students of the department as well as the university. The proposed system used Minutiae Matching Algorithm to identify student's fingerprints. In this project work, all the software modules were implemented using C# Software Development Kit (SDK) and tested in windows PERSPECTIVE 52(252),","authors":["Md.
