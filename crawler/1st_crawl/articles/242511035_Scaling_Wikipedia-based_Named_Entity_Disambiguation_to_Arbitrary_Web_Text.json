{"id":"242511035_Scaling_Wikipedia-based_Named_Entity_Disambiguation_to_Arbitrary_Web_Text","abstract":"This paper investigates the \"named-entity disam- biguation\" task on the Webâ€”identifying the refer- ent of a string, found on an arbitrary Web page. The GROUNDER system, introduced in this paper, ad- dresses two challenges not considered by previous work: how to utilize a priori information (e.g., Bill Clinton is more prominent on the Web than Clin- ton County) to improve disambiguation, and how to compose this prior information with contextual evidence. GROUNDER addresses both challenges by leverag- ing the user-contributed knowledge in Wikipedia and providing a novel formulation of the task. On a sample of strings drawn from the Web, GROUNDER achieves precision of 1.0 at recall 0.34, and preci- sion 0.90 at recall 0.60.","authors":["Anthony Fader","Stephen Soderland","Oren Etzioni"],"meta":["January 2009"],"references":["221012903_Large-Scale_Named_Entity_Disambiguation_Based_on_Wikipedia_Data","220906965_A_Latent_Dirichlet_Model_for_Unsupervised_Entity_Resolution","220947174_Using_Encyclopedic_Knowledge_for_Named_entity_Disambiguation","220873256_The_Tradeoffs_Between_Open_and_Traditional_Relation_Extraction","220817069_Robust_Reading_Identification_and_Tracing_of_Ambiguous_Names","31324597_THE_MEANING_OF_'MEANING'"]}
