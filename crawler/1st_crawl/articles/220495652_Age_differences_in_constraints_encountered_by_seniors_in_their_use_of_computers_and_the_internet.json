{"id":"220495652_Age_differences_in_constraints_encountered_by_seniors_in_their_use_of_computers_and_the_internet","abstract":"The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore older computer users’ constraints at various age stages. We investigated perceived barriers experienced by older adults in the use of computer-mediated information technology in different age segments (the pre-senior, the young–old, and the older-old). Two hundred forty-three senior computer users participated in the study. Respondents’ ages ranged from 50 to 93. Results from exploratory factor analysis and one-way analysis of variance suggested that there were four dimensions of constraints encountered by seniors while dealing with computer-based technologies: Intrapersonal, interpersonal, structural, and functional constraints. These results indicated that senior users might face diverse barriers at different age stages. Implications for developing an effective programming for older adults and research limitations were discussed at the end.","authors":["Bob Lee","Yiwei Chen","Lynne E Hewitt"],"meta":["May 2011Computers in Human Behavior 27(3):1231-1237","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2011.01.003","SourceDBLP"],"references":["251347862_Benefits_and_Privacy_Concerns_of_a_Home_Equipped_with_a_Visual_Sensing_System_A_Perspective_from_Older_Adults","248984005_Computer_Internet_and_E-mail_Use_Among_Older_Adults_Benefits_and_Barriers","248983896_Lifelong_Learning_Becoming_Computer_Savvy_at_a_Later_Age","237264578_Social_Isolation_in_America_Changes_in_Core_Discussion_Networks_Over_Two_Decades","225193833_The_Role_of_Computer_Tuition_in_Community_Health_A_Grounded_Theory_Approach","220437958_Multimodal_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Social_Support_among_Older_Chinese_Internet_Users","41422596_Enhancing_the_Attitudes_and_Self-Efficacy_of_Older_Adults_Toward_Computers_and_the_Internet_Results_of_a_Pilot_Study","13534527_Age_Differences_in_Attitudes_Toward_Computers","5959750_Promoting_Older_Adults'_Well-Being_through_Internet_Training_and_Use","5431128_Internet_Use_and_Loneliness_in_Older_Adults","5296418_Effects_of_Computer_Training_and_Internet_Usage_on_the_Well-Being_and_Quality_of_Life_of_Older_Adults_A_Randomized_Controlled_Study","285794281_Statistical_Methods_for_Health_Care_Research","285747914_The_communication_of_social_support_within_an_on-line_community_for_older_adults_A_qualitative_analysis_of_the_SeniorNet_community","285294812_Market_in_motion","284650734_Psychological_perspectives_on_successful_aging_The_model_of_selective_optimization_with_compensation","283832198_Assistive_technology_computers_and_Internet_may_decrease_sense_of_isolation_for_homebound_elderly_and_disabled_persons","283820745_Computer_use_by_middle-aged_and_older_adults_with_disabilities","281219931_Social_Isolation_in_America_Changes_in_Core_Discussion_Networks_over_Two_Decades","249689691_When_you_retire_does_everything_become_leisure_Information_and_communication_technology_use_and_the_workleisure_boundary_in_retirement","248984002_Reviewing_and_Critiquing_Computer_Learning_and_Usage_Among_Older_Adults","248983996_Older_Computer-Literate_Women_Their_Motivations_Obstacles_and_Paths_to_Success","248983975_Internet_Use_among_Young_and_Older_Adults_Relation_to_Psychological_Well-Being","248983751_Senior_Adults_and_Computers_in_the_1990s","248983565_Teaching_older_adults_to_use_computers_Recommendations_based_on_cognitive_aging_research","245771003_A_Web-Based_Approach_for_Helping_Communities_Become_More_Aging_Friendly","244917035_Meeting_Seniors'_Information_Needs_Using_Computer_Technology","233139126_Pro-Nets_Versus_No-Nets_Differences_in_Urban_Older_Adults'_Predilections_for_Internet_Use","228633458_Aging_and_Information_Technology_Use","227651953_Understanding_interpersonal_interaction_in_an_online_professional_development_course","223707963_Computer_use_among_older_adults_in_a_naturally_occurring_retirement_community","43073309_The_Effects_of_a_Web-Based_Intervention_on_Psychosocial_Well-Being_Among_Adults_Aged_60_and_Older_With_Diabetes_A_Randomized_Trial","24011559_Usability_and_acceptability_of_a_website_that_provides_tailored_advice_on_falls_prevention_activities_for_older_people","22060052_Adult_Development_and_Aging","12650532_Modeling_Computer_Interest_in_Older_Adults_The_Role_of_Age_Education_Computer_Knowledge_and_Computer_Anxiety","11590724_Examining_age_differences_in_performance_of_a_complex_information_search_and_retrieval_task","11349589_Older_Adults_Living_Through_and_With_Their_Computers","8556202_Older_Women_and_the_Internet","7744909_Teaching_Elderly_Adults_to_Use_the_Internet_to_Access_Health_Care_Information_Before-After_Study","7708190_The_digital_divide_Internet_and_e-mail_use_by_the_elderly","7708189_Psychological_barriers_to_Internet_usage_among_older_adults_in_the_UK","6429473_Accessibility_Accommodations_for_Older_Adults_Seeking_e-Health_Information","6157594_Look_Closely_at_All_the_Lonely_People"]}
