{"id":"342784190_Pandemic_designs_for_the_future_perspectives_of_technology_education_teachers_during_COVID-19","abstract":"Purpose\nThe disruption caused by the pandemic declaration and subsequent public health measures put in place have had a substantial effect on teachers’ abilities to support student engagement in technology education (TE). The purpose of this paper is to explore the following research question: How do TE teachers see emergency remote teaching (ERT) transitions to blended learning into the next academic year affecting their profession?\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA snowball and convenience sampling design was used to recruit specialist teachers in TE through their professional organization and were asked to respond to the question: What are your concerns about the future of teaching TE remotely? The qualitative data collected from the participants (N = 42) was analyzed thematically (Braun and Clarke, 2006).\n\nFindings\nThe analysis revealed that the switch to ERT impacted the teachers’ ability to support hands-on competency development owing to inequitable student access to tools, materials and resources, all of which affected student motivation and engagement. As a result, teachers raised questions about the overall effectiveness of online learning approaches and TE’s future and sustainability if offered completely online.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research is the first of its kind exploring the experiences of TE teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In answer to the challenges identified by teachers, the authors offer a blended learning design framework informed by pandemic transformed pedagogy that can serve as a model for educators to use when designing blended instruction.","authors":["Jillianne Code","Rachel Ralph","Kieran Forde"],"meta":["July 2020Information and Learning Sciences ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print)","DOI:10.1108/ILS-04-2020-0112"],"references":["340535196_The_Difference_Between_Emergency_Remote_Teaching_and_Online_Learning","317525957_Four_key_challenges_to_the_design_of_blended_learning_A_systematic_literature_review","315828330_Positioning_Technology_and_Engineering_Education_as_a_Key_Force_in_STEM_Education","285544567_Motivation_Interventions_in_Education_A_Meta-Analytic_Review","254439409_Hybrid_Learning_Environments_Merging_Learning_and_Work_Processes_to_Facilitate_Knowledge_Integration_and_Transitions","235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology","228620687_Educating_for_Sustainability_Competencies_Practices_for_Transformative_Action","48322927_Authentic_and_self-directed_learning_in_vocational_education_Challenges_to_vocational_educators","337237713_The_Maker_Movement_and_Education_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature","303376768_The_operational_definition_of_competency-based_education","288863319_An_overview_on_transformative_learning","263022716_The_equity_imperative_in_tertiary_education_Promoting_fairness_and_efficiency","244959338_A_Motivational_Science_Perspective_on_the_Role_of_Student_Motivation_in_Learning_and_Teaching_Contexts","233464565_What_is_Technology_Education_A_Review_of_the_Official_Curriculum","228941497_From_learning_environments_and_implementation_to_activity_systems_and_expansive_learning","223577073_In_search_of_common_ground_A_task_conceptualization_to_facilitate_the_design_of_elearning_environments_with_design_patterns","215615125_Effective_networked_learning_in_higher_education_notes_and_guidelines"]}
