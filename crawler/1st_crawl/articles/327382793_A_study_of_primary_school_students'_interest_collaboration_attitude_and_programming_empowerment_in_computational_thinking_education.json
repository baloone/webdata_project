{"id":"327382793_A_study_of_primary_school_students'_interest_collaboration_attitude_and_programming_empowerment_in_computational_thinking_education","abstract":"Building on Seymour Papert's view of empowering students by mastering programming, this study conceptualized programming empowerment as consisting of four components: meaningfulness, impact, creative self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy. A sample of 287 primary school students in grades four to six completed a corresponding survey. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. A structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. Also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. Boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. Students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy. These results support future studies that evaluate the impacts of interest-driven computational thinking and programming curricula with ample collaboration opportunities.","authors":["Siu-cheung Kong","Ming Ming Chiu","Ming Lai"],"meta":["September 2018Computers & Education 127(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2018.08.026","Project: Computational Thinking and Coding Education"],"references":["319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","317696965_New_Paper_The_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_high_school_students'_reasoning_skills_and_self-efficacy_and_problem_solving_in_Mathematics","301716623_Computer_science_in_K-12_school_curricula_of_the_2lst_century_Why_what_and_when","316597429_A_K-6_Computational_Thinking_Curriculum_Framework_Implications_for_Teacher_Knowledge","316447356_Making_Computer_Science_Attractive_to_High_School_Girls_with_Computational_Thinking_Approaches_A_Case_Study","311004023_A_framework_of_curriculum_design_for_computational_thinking_development_in_K-12_education","303849505_The_power_of_student_empowerment_Measuring_classroom_predictors_and_individual_indicators","303719849_The_relationship_among_college_students'_psychological_capital_learning_empowerment_and_engagement","303290851_Empowering_the_elderly_population_through_ICT-based_activities_An_empirical_study_of_older_adults_in_Korea","292457151_Empowerment_What_is_it"]}
