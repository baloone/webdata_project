{"id":"252554029_Monitoring_an_online_course_with_the_GISMO_tool_A_case_study","abstract":"This article presents GISMO, a novel, open source, graphic student-tracking tool integrated into Moodle. GISMO repre- sents a further step in information visualization applied to education, and also a novelty in the field of learning manage- ment systems applications. The visualizations of the tool, its uses and the benefits it can bring are illustrated through a detailed case study of an online course. GISMO provides visualizations of behavioral, cognitive and social data from the course, allowing constant monitoring of students' activi- ties, engagement and learning outcomes.","authors":["Riccardo Mazza","Luca Botturi"],"meta":["January 2007Journal of Interactive Learning Research 18(2)"],"references":["253856852_Modular_Object-Oriented_Dynamic_Learning_Environment_What_Open_Source_Has_To_Offer","239929444_Development-oriented_Open_Source_eLearning_Tool_Evaluation_the_Edukalibre_Approach","228605577_Web_based_training_What_do_we_expect_from_the_system","226320983_The_um_toolkit_for_cooperative_user_modelling","221413394_Supporting_Learning_by_Opening_the_Student_Model","221023146_Visualising_student_tracking_data_to_support_instructors_in_web-based_distance_education","220691172_Readings_in_Information_Visualization_Using_Vision_To_Think","253989143_INFORMING_THE_DESIGN_OF_A_COURSE_DATA_VISUALISATOR_AN_EMPIRICAL_STUDY","243784829_Good_teaching_is_good_teaching_An_emerging_set_of_guiding_principles_and_practices_for_the_design_and_development_of_distance_education","243784828_Monitoring_student_learning_in_the_classroom"]}
