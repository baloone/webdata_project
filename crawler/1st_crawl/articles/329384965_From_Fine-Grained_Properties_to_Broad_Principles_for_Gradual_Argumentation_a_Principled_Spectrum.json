{"id":"329384965_From_Fine-Grained_Properties_to_Broad_Principles_for_Gradual_Argumentation_a_Principled_Spectrum","abstract":"The study of properties of gradual evaluation methods in argumentation has received increasing attention in recent years, with studies devoted to various classes of frameworks/ methods leading to conceptually similar but formally distinct properties in different contexts. In this paper we provide a novel systematic analysis for this research landscape by making three main contributions. First, we identify groups of conceptually related properties in the literature, which can be regarded as based on common patterns and, using these patterns, we evidence that many further novel properties can be considered. Then, we provide a simplifying and unifying perspective for these groups of properties by showing that they are all implied by novel parametric principles of (either strict or non-strict) balance and monotonicity. Finally, we show that (instances of) these principles (and thus the group, literature and novel properties that they imply) are satisfied by several quantitative argumentation formalisms in the literature, thus confirming the principlesâ€™ general validity and utility to support a compact, yet comprehensive, analysis of properties of gradual argumentation.","authors":["Pietro Baroni","Antonio Rago","Francesca Toni"],"meta":["December 2018International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 105","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2018.11.019"],"references":["327446033_Imprecise_Probability_and_the_Measurement_of_Keynes's_Weight_of_Arguments","318830209_Acceptability_Semantics_for_Weighted_Argumentation_Frameworks","308610578_A_Multi-Aspect_Evaluation_Framework_for_Comments_on_the_Social_Web","326826062_Argument_strength_in_formal_argumentation","320204026_Quantitative_Argumentation_Debates_with_Votes_for_Opinion_Polling","320201555_Abstract_Games_of_Argumentation_Strategy_and_Game-Theoretical_Argument_Strength","318179732_Evaluation_of_Arguments_in_Weighted_Bipolar_Graphs","316285494_Ranking_Arguments_With_Compensation-Based_Semantics","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","279952015_Equational_approach_to_argumentation_networks","272364999_Automatic_evaluation_of_design_alternatives_with_quantitative_argumentation","222403708_Weighted_argument_systems_Basic_definitions_algorithms_and_complexity_results","220297914_A_Logical_Account_of_Formal_Argumentation"]}
