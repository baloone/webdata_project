{"id":"241631722_Revisiting_Atari_2600_on_an_FPGA","abstract":"In this work we revisit the Atari 2600, the first widely popular home video game, recreating it on a programmable hardware. The console is designed from the scratch using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and prototyped on an FPGA board. The analog television system is replaced by the VGA system without relying on a framebuffer. The project is full featured including joystick controls and audio.","authors":["Guilherme Flach","Calebe Conceição","Marcelo Johann","Ricardo Reis"],"meta":["March 2012","DOI:10.1109/SPL.2012.6211805"],"references":["329957275_Racing_the_Beam_The_Atari_Video_Computer_System","273947373_Racing_the_beam_the_Atari_video_computer_system_Nick_Montfort_and_Ian_Bogost","256398550_Translation_of_VHDL_for_logic_synthesis","247061273_OpenGL_Programming_Guide_The_Official_Guide_to_Learning_OpenGL","31730833_VHDL_for_Logic_Synthesis_A_Rushton","30398000_CRYSTAL_PROGRAMMER'S_GUIDE"]}
