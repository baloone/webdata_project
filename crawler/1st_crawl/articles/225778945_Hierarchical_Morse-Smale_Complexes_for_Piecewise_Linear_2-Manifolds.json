{"id":"225778945_Hierarchical_Morse-Smale_Complexes_for_Piecewise_Linear_2-Manifolds","abstract":"Abstract. We present algorithms for constructing a hierarchy of increasingly coarse Morse—Smale complexes that decompose a piecewise\nlinear 2-manifold. While these complexes are defined only in the smooth category, we extend the construction to the piecewise\nlinear category by ensuring structural integrity and simulating differentiability. We then simplify Morse—Smale complexes\nby canceling pairs of critical points in order of increasing persistence.","authors":["Herbert Edelsbrunner","John Harer","Zomorodian"],"meta":["July 2003Discrete & Computational Geometry 30(1):87-107","DOI:10.1007/s00454-003-2926-5","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["274215361_Geometric_Theory_of_Dynamical_Systems_An_Introduction","267121438_Geometry_and_Topology_for_Mesh_Generation","267056103_Differential_topology_First_steps_2nd_print","246764408_Marching_Cubes_A_High_Resolution_3d_Surface_Construction_Algorithm","244253320_Topological_considerations_in_isosurface_generation","243774379_Models_for_the_Perception_of_Speech_and_Visual_Form","243002021_Computation_of_geometric_properties_from_the_medial_axis_transform_in_Onlogn_time","242609353_An_Introduction_to_Morse_Theory","242561006_Critical_Points_and_Curvature_for_Embedded_Polyhedral_Surfaces","242397003_Sur_les_Points_Singuliers_d'une_Forme_de_Pfaff_Completement_Integrable_ou_d'une_Fonction_Numerique"]}
