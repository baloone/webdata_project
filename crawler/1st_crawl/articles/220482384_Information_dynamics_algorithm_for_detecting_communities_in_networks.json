{"id":"220482384_Information_dynamics_algorithm_for_detecting_communities_in_networks","abstract":"The problem of community detection is relevant in many scientific\ndisciplines, from social science to statistical physics. Given the impact of\ncommunity detection in many areas, such as psychology and social sciences, we\nhave addressed the issue of modifying existing well performing algorithms by\nincorporating elements of the domain application fields, i.e. domain-inspired.\nWe have focused on a psychology and social network - inspired approach which\nmay be useful for further strengthening the link between social network studies\nand mathematics of community detection. Here we introduce a community-detection\nalgorithm derived from the van Dongen's Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL) method\nby considering networks' nodes as agents capable to take decisions. In this\nframework we have introduced a memory factor to mimic a typical human behavior\nsuch as the oblivion effect. The method is based on information diffusion and\nit includes a non-linear processing phase. We test our method on two classical\ncommunity benchmark and on computer generated networks with known community\nstructure. Our approach has three important features: the capacity of detecting\noverlapping communities, the capability of identifying communities from an\nindividual point of view and the fine tuning the community detectability with\nrespect to prior knowledge of the data. Finally we discuss how to use a Shannon\nentropy measure for parameter estimation in complex networks.","authors":["Emanuele Massaro","Andrea Guazzini","Franco Bagnoli","Pietro Lio"],"meta":["December 2011Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation abs/1112.1224(11)","DOI:10.1016/j.cnsns.2012.03.023","SourceDBLP"],"references":["248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","235737451_Evolution_of_networks","232585558_Priming_Effects_in_Word-Fragment_Completion_are_Independent_of_Recognition_Memory","232543328_Repetition_and_frequency_attenuation_in_lexical_access","226557063_The_bottlenose_dolphin_community_of_Doubtful_Sound_features_a_large_proportion_of_long-lasting_associations","49653132_Heuristic_Decision_Making","45925112_Impact_of_network_structure_on_a_model_of_diffusion_and_competitiveinteraction","13229461_Superparamagnetic_Clustering_of_Data","11499120_Models_of_Ecological_Rationality_The_Recognition_Heuristic","7797121_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","1910341_Detecting_the_overlapping_and_hierarchical_community_structure_in_complex_networks","285382029_Epidermal_Wound_Healing","274451446_Social_Network_Analysis_A_Handbook","265329790_Mathematical_biology_2nd_ed","259173905_Social_Network_Analysis","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","237625155_Critical_behavior_of_a_two-species_reaction-diffusion_problem_in_2D","233822567_A_Behavioral_Model_of_Rational_Choice","232771086_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","225130449_Newman_MEJ_Detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Eur_Phys_J_B_382_321-330","220656489_Graph_clustering_via_a_discrete_uncoupling_process_SIAM_J_Matrix_Anal_Appl_30121-141","201169073_A_Behavioral_Model_of_Rational_Choice","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","30013070_On_Finding_Graph_Clusterings_with_Maximum_Modularity","12240125_Critical_behavior_of_a_two-species_reaction-diffusion_problem","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","1827666_Statistical_Mechanics_Of_Complex_Networks"]}
