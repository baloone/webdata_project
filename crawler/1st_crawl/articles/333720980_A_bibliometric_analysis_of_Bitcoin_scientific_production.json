{"id":"333720980_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_Bitcoin_scientific_production","abstract":"Blockchain technology, and more specifically bitcoin (one of its foremost applications), have been receiving increasing attention in the scientific community. The first publications with bitcoin as a topic, can be traced back to 2012. In spite of this short time span, the production magnitude (1162 papers) makes it necessary to make a bibliometric study in order to observe research clusters, emerging topics, and leading scholars. Our paper is aimed at studying the scientific production only around bitcoin, excluding other blockchain applications. Thus, we restricted our search to papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, whose topic is “bitcoin”. This database is suitable for such diverse disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. This bibliometric study draws the landscape of the current state and trends of bitcoin-related research in different scientific disciplines.","authors":["Ignasi Merediz-Solá","Aurelio F.
