{"id":"331973476_Design_and_Application_of_a_Platform_of_Wireless_Sensor_and_Control_Network_in_Robotics_Course_of_Mechanical_Engineering_Technology","abstract":"Robotics is one form of interdisciplinary field\nwhich involves the tight integration of mechanical systems,\nelectrical systems, computer systems, and information systems.\nHowever for students enrolled in the Engineering Technology\nprograms, especially the Mechanical Engineering Technology\n(MET) program to learn robotics, they are confronted with two\ndifficulties: (1) limited number of fundamental robotics-related\ncourses, (2) limited robotics course hours. In order to help the\nstudents of MET to overcome these two difficulties, a wireless\nsensor and control network (WSCN) platform is designed and\nemployed. This platform has two advantages: affordable and\nfoolproof. Therefore, students can avoid exposing themselves to\ncomplicated algorithms. They can focus on the applications of\nrobotics to develop sophisticated projects. Before introducing\nWSCN,, the existing entry-level robotics course was redesigned\nbased on the pre-class survey results and the assessment of the\nstudents’ abilities. Subsequently, the students were instructed to\nfamiliarize themselves with the basic sensors and actuators, the\nArduino development kit and the c-based programming. Then,\nthe platform was implemented in the course. In addition, a series\nof homework and projects were assigned. Through these\nassignments, the students were able to design practical projects\nusing the platform. It was proven that the platform enhanced the\nstudents’ understanding of the fundamental concepts, inspired\nthe students’ interest in this course, and improved their\nperformance in the robotics classes.","authors":["Zhou Zhang","Andy Zhang","Mingshao Zhang","Sven Esche"],"meta":["March 2019Computers in Education Journal 10(1)"],"references":["335757090_Development_of_an_Interface_and_Connectivity_Platform_for_a_Basic_IoT_Training_Module","308795979_A_Virtual_Laboratory_System_with_Biometric_Authentication_and_Remote_Proctoring_Based_on_Facial_Recognition","288753059_Novel_experiential_learning_practices_in_engineering_education_based_on_inexpensive_3D_printers","278727923_Universal_Range_Data_Acquisition_for_Educational_Laboratories_Using_Microsoft_Kinect","278727833_A_Platform_for_Mechanical_Assembly_Education_Using_the_Microsoft_Kinect","269333347_Integration_of_Physical_Devices_into_Game-based_Virtual_Reality","268366683_Development_of_a_senior_level_robotics_course_for_engineering_students","267595016_Integration_of_a_Real-Time_Remote_Experiment_Into_a_Multi-Player_Game_Laboratory_Environment","327620366_Design_elements_of_a_mobile_robotics_course_based_on_student_feedback","267004023_Wireless_Sensor_and_Actuator_Networks_Algorithms_and_Protocols_for_Scalable_Coordination_and_Data_Communication"]}
