{"id":"330919391_On_some_bounds_of_the_topological_indices_of_generalized_Sierpinski_and_extended_Sierpinski_graphs","abstract":"Sierpiński graphs are extensively studied graphs of fractal nature with applications in topology, mathematics of Tower of Hanoi and computer science. The generalized Sierpiński graphs are defined by replication of exactly the same graph, yielding self-similar graph. Certain graph invariants referred to as topological indices are used to determine a large number of properties like physico-chemical properties, thermodynamic properties, chemical activity and biological activity of chemical graphs. In QSAR/QSPR study, these graph invariants play a vital role.\nIn this article, we study the topological indices of generalized Sierpiński and extended Sierpiński graphs with an arbitrary base graph. We obtain bounds for the atom-bond connectivity index, harmonic index, Zagreb indices and sum-connectivity index for the generalized Sierpiński graphs and extended Sierpiński graphs.","authors":["Imran Javaid","Hira Benish","Muhammad Imran","Amna Khan"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Inequalities and Applications 2019(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13660-019-1990-1"],"references":["319967972_Some_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Base-3_Sierpinski_Graphs_341","315642509_On_topological_properties_of_sierpinski_networks_250","291295547_On_Multiple_Zagreb_Indices_of_TiO2_Nanotubes","283335471_On_the_General_Randic_index_of_polymeric_networks_modelled_by_generalized_Sierpinski_graphs","276059309_Zagreb_indices_and_their_polynomials_of_the_linear_parallelogram_of_benzenoid_graph_114","269873646_On_Multiple_Zagreb_indices_of_Circumcoronene_Homologous_Series_of_Benzenoid_103","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","277942106_Sum-connectivity_index_of_a_graph","268071040_Multiplicative_Versions_of_First_Zagreb_Index","266612433_Note_on_multiple_Zagreb_indices"]}
