{"id":"242693463_IS_A_HIGH_GPA_STILL_THE_MOST_IMPORTANT_FACTOR_FOR_JOB_OPPORTUNITY_-_AN_EMPIRICAL_INVESTIGATION","abstract":"The Information Technology (IT) industry changes rapidly. MIS departments need to periodically review and revise their curricula in order to equip their graduates with the most marketable knowledge and skills for future job markets. Little empirical study has been conducted in this area. In this exploratory study, we tried to answer the following research questions: (1) Is GPA still the most important factor for MIS graduates to find a job in this changing business environment? (2) If not, what are other factors that are becoming more important? (3) How can we revise our current MIS curricula to meet the challenges and new requirements from industries in the changing world? In answering the above research questions, a survey was sent to 120 senior MIS students in a big public university. The results of the survey were analyzed and the implications are discussed.","authors":["Wayne Huang"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
