{"id":"283028019_A_Cloud-Based_Experiment_Platform_for_Computer-Based_Education","abstract":"The computer-based education is the most popular teaching method in universities. Maintaining an all-purpose experiment environment based on physical computers is hard because different courses need different environments. Meanwhile, hardware-related experiment is suffering from the restriction of equipment location. This paper presents a work in progress on the development of a cloud-based experiment platform. We customize an IaaS cloud for the experiment context and propose solutions for software-based experiment and hardware-related simulation respectively. For a prototype system, the virtualization efficiency and user experience are discussed. In contrast with the traditional experiment environment, the cloud-based approach is more extensible for software-based experiments and it can extend the applicable scope of laboratory equipments.","authors":["Yu Liu","Bo Li","Jianwei Niu","Qinghua Cao"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1109/UCC.2014.100"],"references":["288264141_A_Proposed_Architecture_of_Cloud_Computing_for_Education_System_in_Bangladesh_and_the_Impact_on_Current_Education_System","235746561_Supporting_self-regulated_learning_in_computer-based_learning_environments_Systematic_review_of_effects_of_scaffolding_in_the_domain_of_science_education","234832849_Cloud_computing_infrastructure_prototype_for_university_education_and_research","228864221_Using_Cloud_Computing_in_Higher_Education_A_Strategy_to_Improve_Agility_in_the_Current_Financial_Crisis","229034213_Cloud_computing_for_education_and_learning_Education_and_learning_as_a_service_ELaaS","228661937_KVM_The_Linux_virtual_machine_monitor","2923693_Xen_and_the_Art_of_Virtualization"]}
