{"id":"325479145_The_g-extra_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_crossed_cubes","abstract":"Connectivity and diagnosability are two important parameters for the fault tolerant of an interconnection network G. In 1996, Fàbrega and Fiol proposed the g-extra connectivity of G. In 2016, Zhang et al. proposed the g-extra diagnosability of G that requires every component of G−S has at least (g+1) vertices. The g-extra connectivity of G is necessary for g-extra diagnosability of G. In this paper, we show that the g-extra connectivity of the crossed cube CQn is n(g+1)−[Formula presented]g(g+3) for n ≥ 5, 0≤g≤⌊[Formula presented]⌋ and the g-extra diagnosability of CQn is (n−[Formula presented]g)(g+1) under the PMC model for n ≥ 5, 0≤g≤⌊[Formula presented]⌋ and the MM* model for n ≥ 7, 0≤g≤⌊[Formula presented]⌋.","authors":["Shiying Wang","Xiaolei Ma"],"meta":["November 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 336:60-66","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.04.054"],"references":["305749910_The_2-Extra_Connectivity_and_2-Extra_Diagnosability_of_Bubble-Sort_Star_Graph_Networks","293328537_On_extra_connectivity_and_extra_edge-connectivity_of_balanced_hypercubes","282834688_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_k_-ary_n_-cube_networks","273490370_The_g_-extra_conditional_diagnosability_and_sequential_t_k_-diagnosability_of_hypercubes"]}
