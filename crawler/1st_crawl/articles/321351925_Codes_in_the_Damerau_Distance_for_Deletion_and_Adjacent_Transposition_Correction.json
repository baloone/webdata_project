{"id":"321351925_Codes_in_the_Damerau_Distance_for_Deletion_and_Adjacent_Transposition_Correction","abstract":"Motivated by applications in DNA-based storage, we introduce the new problem of code design in the Damerau metric. The Damerau metric is a generalization of the Levenshtein distance which, in addition to deletions, insertions and substitution errors also accounts for adjacent transposition edits. We first provide constructions for codes that may correct either a single deletion or a single adjacent transposition and then proceed to extend these results to codes that can simultaneously correct a single deletion and multiple adjacent transpositions. We conclude with constructions for joint block deletion and adjacent block transposition error-correcting codes.","authors":["Ryan Gabrys","Eitan Yaakobi","Olgica Milenkovic"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2778143"],"references":["318406357_Portable_and_Error-Free_DNA-Based_Data_Storage","313228704_Codes_Correcting_a_Burst_of_Deletions_or_Insertions","279969077_DNA-Based_Storage_Trends_and_Methods","276211156_A_Rewritable_Random-Access_DNA-Based_Storage_System","268223352_Codes_for_Correcting_Three_or_More_Adjacent_Deletions_or_Insertions","265787917_On_Single-Deletion-Correcting_Codes","261201907_A_note_on_non-binary_multiple_insertiondeletion_correcting_codes","235375794_Towards_practical_high-capacity_low-maintenance_information_storage_in_synthesized_DNA","233402452_Non-asymptotic_Upper_Bounds_for_Deletion_Correcting_Codes","230698422_Next-Generation_Digital_Information_Storage_in_DNA","8448486_MEGA3_Integrated_software_for_Molecular_Evolutionary_Genetics_Analysis_and_sequence_alignment","306116108_On_ordered_syndromes_for_multi_insertiondeletion_error-correcting_codes","305745141_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","303905278_A_DNA-Based_Archival_Storage_System","301898316_Exact_Reconstruction_From_Insertions_in_Synchronization_Codes","280329908_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","272195041_New_Multiple_Insertion-Deletion_Correcting_Codes_for_Non-Binary_Alphabets","260542515_Graded_Bit-Error-Correcting_Codes_With_Applications_to_Flash_Memory","235008707_Intoduction_to_Coding_Theory","220424167_A_Technique_for_Computer_Detection_and_Correction_of_Spelling_Errors","51986583_Binary_Codes_Capable_of_Correcting_Deletions_Insertions_and_Reversals","9045046_Endogenous_DNA_double-strand_breaks_Production_fidelity_of_repair_and_induction_of_cancer","3080972_On_Codes_Derivable_from_the_Tensor_Product_of_Check_Matrices","3079942_Asymptotically_Good_Codes_Correcting_Insertions_Deletions_and_Transpositions","2552471_An_Improved_Error_Model_for_Noisy_Channel_Spelling_Correction"]}
