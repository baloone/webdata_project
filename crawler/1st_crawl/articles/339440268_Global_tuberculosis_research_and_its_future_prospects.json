{"id":"339440268_Global_tuberculosis_research_and_its_future_prospects","abstract":"Tuberculosis is the infectious disease that causes the most deaths each year in the world. Around 25% of the population is estimated to be infected with, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that gives rise to the disease, and more than one and a half million people die each year from this cause. A rigorous bibliometric analysis has been developed around tuberculosis disease, and the most remarkable results are presented in this paper. It is observed that interest in tuberculosis is growing, and the control of its spread has become one of the main health priorities in the world, with the United States, the United Kingdom, and India, leading the research in this area. On the other hand, it has been observed that there are two main health concerns around the tuberculosis: drug-resistant tuberculosis and co-infection with HIV. Finally, conclusions are offered, playing a frontline role in science policy decisions and research performance evaluations.","authors":["José A Garrido-Cárdenas","Cristina de Lamo Sevilla","M.T.
