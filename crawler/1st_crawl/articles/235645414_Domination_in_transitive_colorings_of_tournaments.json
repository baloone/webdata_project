{"id":"235645414_Domination_in_transitive_colorings_of_tournaments","abstract":"An edge coloring of a tournament $T$ with colors $1,2,\\dots,k$ is called \\it\n$k$-transitive \\rm if the digraph $T(i)$ defined by the edges of color $i$ is\ntransitively oriented for each $1\\le i \\le k$. We explore a conjecture of the\nsecond author: For each positive integer $k$ there exists a (least) $p(k)$ such\nthat every $k$-transitive tournament has a dominating set of at most $p(k)$\nvertices.\nWe show how this conjecture relates to other conjectures and results. For\nexample, it is a special case of a well-known conjecture of Erd\\H os, Sands,\nSauer and Woodrow (so the conjecture is interesting even if false). We show\nthat the conjecture implies a stronger conjecture, a possible extension of a\nresult of B\\'ar\\'any and Lehel on covering point sets by boxes. The principle\nused leads also to an upper bound $O(2^{2^{d-1}}d\\log d)$ on the\n$d$-dimensional box-cover number that is better than all previous bounds, in a\nsense close to best possible. We also improve the best bound known in\n3-dimensions from $3^{14}$ to 64 and propose possible further improvements\nthrough finding the maximum domination number over parity tournaments.","authors":["Dömötör Pálvölgyi","András Gyárfás"],"meta":["February 2013Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 107(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2014.02.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265521433_Kernels_by_monochromatic_directed_paths_in_3-colored_tournaments_and_quasi-tournaments","24269300_Unparticle_self-interactions","262280004_Covering_with_Euclidean_Boxes","243788242_On_monochromatic_paths_in_m-coloured_tournaments","230596110_Transitive_Orientaion_of_Graphs_and_Identification_of_Permutation_Graphs","225788503_Almost_tight_bounds_fore-Nets","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs","222632875_Monochromatic_sinks_in_nearly_transitive_arc-colored_tournaments","222575665_Dominating_sets_in_k-majority_tournaments","220442224_Bounding_the_Vertex_Cover_Number_of_a_Hypergraph","220441754_Covering_graphs_by_the_minimum_number_of_equivalence_relations","220441324_Eigenvalues_geometric_expanders_sorting_in_rounds_amd_Ramsey_theory","220397687_Monochromatic_Paths_and_at_Most_2-Coloured_Arc_Sets_in_Edge-Coloured_Tournaments","37464993_A_Remark_on_Transversal_Numbers"]}
