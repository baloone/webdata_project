{"id":"320320944_Comprehensive_functional_genomics_using_Caenorhabditis_elegans_as_a_model_organism","abstract":"We have been working on functional genomics using C. elegans as a model organism. We first used cell-type specific markers and preexisting mutants to investigate how genotype-phenotype causal relationships are regulated. With the aid of transgenic methods, we analyzed various biological processes in C. elegans. We have developed efficient methods to isolate gene knockout strains. Thousands of strains isolated this way are used by many researchers and have revealed many biological mechanisms. We have also developed methods to examine the functions of genes in a comprehensive manner by integrating transgenes into chromosomes, designing conditional knockouts, and creating balancers for lethal mutations. A combination of these biological resources and techniques will be useful to understand the functions of genes in C. elegans, which has many genes that are orthologous to those of higher organisms including humans.","authors":["Shohei Mitani"],"meta":["October 2017Proceedings of the Japan Academy Ser B Physical and Biological Sciences 93(8):561-577","DOI:10.2183/pjab.93.036","Project: functional genomics using C. elegans and mammalian cell lines"],"references":["308418601_Engineering_new_balancer_chromosomes_in_C_Elegans_via_CRISPRCas9","285392273_Locus-specific_integration_of_extrachromosomal_transgenes_in_C_elegans_with_the_CRISPRCas9_system","280567777_Longevity_Genes_Revealed_by_Integrative_Analysis_of_Isoform-Specific_daf-16FoxO_Mutants_of_Caenorhabditis_elegans","327478779_Efficient_gene_transfer_in_Celegans_extrachromosomal_maintenance_and_integration_of_transforming_sequences","320559675_The_fluorescent_toolbox_for_assessing_protein_location_and_function","309026585_Next-Generation_Sequencing-Based_Approaches_for_Mutation_Mapping_and_Identification_in_Caenorhabditis_elegans","306920317_Distinct_roles_of_the_two_VPS33_proteins_in_the_endolysosomal_system_in_Caenorhabditis_elegans_Distinct_roles_of_two_Vps33_proteins","306075941_Programmed_Cell_Death_During_Caenorhabditis_elegans_Development","301217323_Analysis_of_589306_genomes_identifies_individuals_resilient_to_severe_Mendelian_childhood_diseases","281265089_The_Structure_of_the_Nervous_System_of_the_Nematode_Caenorhabditis_elegans"]}
