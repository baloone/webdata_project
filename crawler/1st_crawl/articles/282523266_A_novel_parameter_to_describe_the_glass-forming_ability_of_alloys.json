{"id":"282523266_A_novel_parameter_to_describe_the_glass-forming_ability_of_alloys","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new parameter for glass-forming ability (GFA) based on the combination of thermodynamic (stability of stable and metastable liquids by ΔTm=Tmmix-Tl and ΔTx=Tx-Tg, respectively) and kinetic (resistance to crystallization by Tx) aspects for glass formation. The parameter is defined as ε=(ΔTm+ΔTx+Tx)/Tmmix without directly adding Tg while considering the whole temperature range for glass formation up to Tmmix, which reflects the relative position of crystallization curve in continuous cooling transformation diagram. The relationship between the ε parameter and critical cooling rate (Rc) or maximum section thickness for glass formation (Zmax) clearly confirms that the ε parameter exhibits a better correlation with GFA than other commonly used GFA parameters, such as ΔTx (=Tx-Tg), K (=[Tx-Tg]/[Tl-Tx]), ΔT∗(=(Tmmix-Tl)/Tmmix), Trg (=Tg/Tl), and γ (=[Tx]/[Tl+Tg]). The relationship between the ε parameter and Rc or Zmax is also formulated and evaluated in the study. The results suggest that the ε parameter can effectively predict Rc and Zmax for various glass-forming alloys, which would permit more widespread uses of these paradigm-shifting materials in a variety of industries.","authors":["E.
