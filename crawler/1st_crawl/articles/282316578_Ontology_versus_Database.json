{"id":"282316578_Ontology_versus_Database","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to clarify the differences between ontologies and databases. The article describes, in a step-by-step manner, the parts in which differences occur. However, there are also similarities proving that ontologies and databases are not completely different. Based on these aspects, this paper presents various approaches to transforming a database to ontology. The conclusion summarizes and highlights the most important similarities and differences.","authors":["Michal Sir","Zdenek Bradac","Petr Fiedler"],"meta":["December 2015IFAC-PapersOnLine 48(4):220-225","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.07.036"],"references":["262215357_Ontology_for_sensors","251332115_Ontologies_versus_relational_databases_Are_they_so_different_A_comparison","243772462_Ontology_Development_101_A_Guide_to_Creating_Your_First_Ontology","220853947_A_Metamodel_and_UML_Profile_for_Rule-Extended_OWL_DL_Ontologies","303166890_Ontologies_versus_relational_databases_Are_they_so_different","221651335_Towards_the_Semantic_Web_-_An_Approach_to_Reverse_Engineering_of_Relational_Databases_to_Ontologies","29453963_An_HTML-Form-Driven_Approach_to_Reverse_Engineering_of_Relational_Databases_to_Ontologies"]}
