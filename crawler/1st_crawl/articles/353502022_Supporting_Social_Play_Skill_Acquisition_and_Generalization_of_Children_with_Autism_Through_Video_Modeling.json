{"id":"353502022_Supporting_Social_Play_Skill_Acquisition_and_Generalization_of_Children_with_Autism_Through_Video_Modeling","abstract":"This study assessed the effects of portable video modeling on social interactions of four children with autism, three boys and one girl, 4- to 5-year-olds, in preschools in Iceland. Participants were shown 1-min videos on a small handheld device where a peer model initiated social interactions and played with two peers. A multiple-probe-across-participants design showed that video modeling reduced latency to social initiation and increased reciprocal play and language use per 5-min play sessions. Improvements generalized to other peers, a larger group, and to the main classroom and were maintained post intervention. These preliminary findings suggest that video modeling with a handheld device could support the acquisition and generalization of social play of preschool children with autism in natural settings.","authors":["Anna-Lind Pétursdóttir","Thorhalla Gudmundsdottir"],"meta":["July 2021Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders","DOI:10.1007/s10803-021-05204-4"],"references":["311553232_Evaluating_the_Efficacy_of_Video-Based_Instruction_VBI_on_Improving_Social_Initiation_Skills_of_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_ASD_A_Review_of_Literature","298213931_Antecedent_Social_Skills_Interventions_for_Individuals_With_ASD_What_Works_for_Whom_and_Under_What_Conditions","270825355_Peer-Video_Modeling_Teaching_Chained_Social_Game_Behaviors_to_Children_with_ASD","260395082_Using_Portable_Video_Modeling_Technology_to_Increase_the_Compliment_Behaviors_of_Children_with_Autism_During_Athletic_Group_Play","279272366_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Video_Modeling_and_Video_Self-Modeling_Interventions_for_Children_and_Adolescents_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders","275216454_An_Evaluation_of_the_Quality_of_Research_on_Evidence-Based_Practices_for_Daily_Living_Skills_for_Individuals_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder","271632218_Video_Modeling_Interventions_to_Improve_Play_Skills_of_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","270344180_The_Comparative_Effectiveness_of_Portable_Video_Modeling_vs_Traditional_Video_Modeling_Interventions_with_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders","263337102_Single_case_research_methodology_Applications_in_special_education_and_behavioral_sciences","247857008_Multiple-probe_technique_A_variation_of_the_multiple_baseline","245925424_Evaluating_the_Effectiveness_of_Video_Instruction_on_Social_and_Communication_Skills_Training_for_Children_With_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Review_of_the_Literature","247856998_An_implicit_technology_of_generalization1","247784892_The_Use_of_Video_Modeling_via_a_Video_iPod_and_a_System_of_Least_Prompts_to_Improve_Transitional_Behaviors_for_Students_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_in_the_General_Education_Classroom","247784860_Using_Video_Modeling_to_Teach_Complex_Play_Sequences_to_a_Preschooler_with_Autism","247784813_Effects_of_Video_Modeling_and_Video_Feedback_on_Peer-Directed_Social_Language_Skills_of_a_Child_With_Autism"]}
