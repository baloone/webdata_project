{"id":"308026907_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Regular_Graph_Covers","abstract":"A graph $G$ covers a graph $H$ if there exists a locally bijective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We deal with regular covers in which this homomorphism is prescribed by the action of a semiregular subgroup of ${\\rm Aut}(G)$. Regular covers have many applications constructions and studies of big objects all over mathematics and computer science. We study computational aspects of regular covers that have not been addressed before. The decision problem RegularCover asks for given graphs $G$ and $H$ whether $G$ regularly covers $H$. When $|H|=1$, this problem becomes Cayley graph recognition for which the complexity is still unresolved. Another special case arises for $|G| = |H|$ when it becomes the graph isomorphism problem. Our main result shows that RegularCover can be solved for planar inputs $G$ in FPT time $O^*(2^{e(H)/2})$ where $e(H)$ denotes the number of the edges of $H$. In comparison, B\\'ilka et al. (2011) proved that testing general graph covers is NP-complete for planar inputs $G$ when $H$ is a small fixed graph such as $K_4$ or $K_5$.","authors":["Jiří Fiala","Pavel Klavík","Jan Kratochvíl","Roman Nedela"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["305322048_Graph_Isomorphism_Restricted_by_Lists","263773666_Automorphism_Groups_of_Geometrically_Represented_Graphs","260231547_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Regular_Graph_Covers_with_Applications_to_Planar_Graphs","288923398_Moore_graphs_and_beyond_A_survey","284415293_The_theory_of_groups_Graphical_representation","279458869_IV-matching_is_strongly_NP-hard","265459658_Riemann_surfaces_2nd_ed","265435167_A_Combinatorial_Decomposition_Theory","265366563_Automorphisms_of_Trivalent_Graphs","256157518_Automorphism_groups_of_planar_graphs_I"]}
