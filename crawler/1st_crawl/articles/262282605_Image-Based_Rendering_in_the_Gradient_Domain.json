{"id":"262282605_Image-Based_Rendering_in_the_Gradient_Domain","abstract":"We propose a novel image-based rendering algorithm for handling complex scenes that may include reflective surfaces. Our key contribution lies in treating the problem in the gradient domain. We use a standard technique to estimate scene depth, but assign depths to image gradients rather than pixels. A novel view is obtained by rendering the horizontal and vertical gradients, from which the final result is reconstructed through Poisson integration using an approximate solution as a data term. Our algorithm is able to handle general scenes including reflections and similar effects without explicitly separating the scene into reflective and transmissive parts, as required by previous work. Our prototype renderer is fully implemented on the GPU and runs in real time on commodity hardware.","authors":["Johannes Kopf","Fabian Langguth","Daniel Scharstein","Richard Szeliski"],"meta":["November 2013ACM Transactions on Graphics 32(6)","DOI:10.1145/2508363.2508369"],"references":["262354511_Depth_Synthesis_and_Local_Warps_for_Plausible_Image-Based_Navigation","254461917_Image-Based_Rendering_for_Scenes_with_Reflections","227212533_Stereo_and_Specular_Reflection","221110968_Piecewise_Planar_Stereo_for_Image-based_Rendering","220721484_Multi-image_Interpolation_based_on_Graph-cuts_and_Symmetric_Optical_Flow","220183603_High-Quality_Video_View_Interpolation_Using_a_Layered_Representation","38412938_Unstructured_Lumigraph_Rendering","7305070_Stereo_matching_with_linear_superposition_of_layers","3854220_Blind_recovery_of_transparent_and_semireflected_scenes","3816609_Polarization-based_decorrelation_of_transparent_layers_The_inclination_angle_of_an_invisible_surface","3813415_Computing_rectifying_homographies_for_stereo_vision","3636248_Skin_and_bones_Multilayer_locally_affine_optical_flow_and_regularization_with_transparency","3507747_Unified_computational_theory_for_motion_transparency_and_motion_boundaries_based_on_eigenenergy_analysis","3192055_A_three-frame_algorithm_for_estimating_two-component_image_motion","2912574_View_Interpolation_for_Image_Synthesis","2908246_The_Lumigraph","2670286_Skin_and_Bones_Multi-layer_Locally_Affine_Optical_Flow_and_Regularization_with_Transparency","2633361_Computing_Rectifying_Homographies_for_Stereo_Vision","2480841_Computing_Occluding_and_Transparent_Motions","2412193_Multi-View_Scene_Capture_by_Surfel_Sampling_From_Video_Streams_to_Non-Rigid_3D_Motion_Shape_Reflectance","2357395_Polarization-based_Decorrelation_of_Transparent_Layers_The_Inclination_Angle_of_an_Invisible_Surface","339504448_Image-Based_Rendering","297786710_Multi-view_scene_capture_by_surfel_sampling_From_video_streams_to_non-rigid_3D_motion_shape_and_reflectance","274422361_Moving_gradients","230630412_An_Introductionto_the_Conjugate_Gradient_Method_Without_the_Agonizing_Pain","227673852_Floating_Textures","222528309_Extracting_layers_and_analyzing_their_specular_properties_using_epipolar-plane-image_analysis","221364082_Overcoming_visual_reverberations","220694078_Image-Based_Rendering","220506608_Reflected-Scene_Impostors_for_Realistic_Reflections_at_Interactive_Rates","220184526_Moving_Gradients_A_Path-Based_Method_for_Plausible_Image_Interpolation","220184251_Ambient_Point_Clouds_for_View_Interpolation","220184195_Photo_tourism_exploring_photo_collections_in_3D_ACM_Trans_Graph_253835-846","220183775_Poisson_image_editing","45174936_Ambient_point_clouds_for_view_interpolation","32896299_Multi-camera_Scene_Reconstruction_via_Graph_Cuts","5764827_Hirschmller_H_Stereo_processing_by_semiglobal_matching_and_mutual_information_IEEE_PAMI_302_328-341","5582193_Blind_Separation_of_Superimposed_Shifted_Images_Using_Parameterized_Joint_Diagonalization","4082225_Separating_reflections_from_a_single_image_using_local_features","3854142_Layer_extraction_from_multiple_images_containing_reflections_and_transparency","2876471_Light_Field_Rendering","2584325_Layered_Depth_Images","2386241_Modeling_and_Rendering_Architecture_from_Photographs_A_Hybrid_Geometry-_and_Image-Based_Approach"]}
