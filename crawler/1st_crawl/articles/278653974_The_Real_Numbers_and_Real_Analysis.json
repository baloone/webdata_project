{"id":"278653974_The_Real_Numbers_and_Real_Analysis","abstract":"In this chapter, our final one, we bring together a number of ideas that we saw in previous chapters. We learned about sequences of numbers in Chapter 8, and series of numbers in Chapter 9. In the present chapter we study sequences and series of functions, which we will then use to further our study of power series (which was commenced in Section 9.5), and finally to construct a continuous but nowhere differentiable function, a fitting point at which to conclude our study of introductory real analysis.","authors":["Ethan D.
