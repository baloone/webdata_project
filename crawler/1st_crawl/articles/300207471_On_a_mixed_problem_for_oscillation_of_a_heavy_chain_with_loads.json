{"id":"300207471_On_a_mixed_problem_for_oscillation_of_a_heavy_chain_with_loads","abstract":"A mixed hyperbolic problem is considered. The dependence between the boundary values, right-hand term and the solution is given explicitly, using the Laplace transform. The simplicity of the eigenvalues is proved with the help of integral representation of the Hankel function.","authors":["N. Yu. Kapustin","A. A.
