{"id":"309777746_Robotics_and_programming_Attracting_girls_to_technology","abstract":"This paper presents the Metabotix project: Teaching Robotics and Programming for girls, which is being developed since 2014 at Instituto Federal de Goiás - Campus Luziânia, using free/open hardware and software, and recyclable electronic materials. The project counts on interdisciplinary methodology for learning robotics. Students apply the knowledge acquired in high school classes aiming to grow girls interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas.","authors":["Christiane Borges Santos","Deller James Ferreira","Maria Carolina Borim do Nascimento Rodrigues de Souza","Andressa Rodrigues Martins"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732353","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)"],"references":["262346747_DOROTHY_Integrating_Graphical_Programming_with_Robotics_to_Stimulate_Interest_in_Computing_Careers","261960783_A_Crafts-Oriented_Approach_to_Computing_in_High_School_Introducing_Computational_Concepts_Practices_and_Perspectives_with_Electronic_Textiles","241623861_Learning_to_Program_with_Personal_Robots_Influences_on_Student_Motivation","220094538_Why_Latino_High_School_Students_Select_Computer_Science_as_a_Major_Analysis_of_a_Success_Story","220140191_Exploring_the_educational_potential_of_robotics_in_schools_A_systematic_review","220094596_INSPIRED_high_school_computing_academies"]}
