{"id":"262327365_Cake_Cutting_Not_Just_Child's_Play","abstract":"Experts suggest that computer scientists need to play a key role in proper allocation of limited resources between unlimited wants and demands. Experts state that such fair division is considered a significant subfield of microeconomic theory. Experts illustrate the example of cake cutting to reveal the significance of fair allocation of resources among all concerned parties. Cake cutting is a useful metaphor for the more formal-sounding task of allocating a heterogeneous divisible good among multiple players with different preferences. The study of fair cake-cutting algorithms has originated with Steinhaus, Knaster, and Banach in Poland during World War II and has attracted mathematicians, economists and political scientists over a period of time. Reasoning about the complexity of cake-cutting algorithms requires a model specifying what such an algorithm can do.","authors":["Ariel D.
