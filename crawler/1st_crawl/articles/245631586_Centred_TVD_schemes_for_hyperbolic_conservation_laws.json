{"id":"245631586_Centred_TVD_schemes_for_hyperbolic_conservation_laws","abstract":"New first- and high-order centred methods for conservation laws are presented. Convenient TVD conditions for constructing centred TVD schemes are then formulated and some useful results are proved. Two families of centred TVD schemes are constructed and extended to nonlinear systems. Some numerical results are also presented.","authors":["Eleuterio Toro","S. J.
