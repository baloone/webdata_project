{"id":"327449663_Verification_of_Scheduling_Properties_Based_on_Execution_Traces","abstract":"Despite the use of scheduling analysis when designing hard real-time systems, some erroneous temporal behaviors may still occur at runtime. Monitoring the execution of the system during runtime is a way to spot faulty behaviors. We focus on inline and embedded monitoring for the verification of general but essential temporal properties: scheduling properties. This paper presents an approach for the temporal scheduling properties verification part of monitoring. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a benchmark, detecting missed deadlines, priority inversions, deadlocks and locked resources, in keeping with scheduling analysis and simulation results.","authors":["Valerie-Anne Nicolas","Mounir Lallali","St√©phane Rubini","Frank Singhoff"],"meta":["December 2018Ada User Journal 39(4):pp291--295","Project: Project Cheddar,  a  tool for real-time scheduling analysis"],"references":["317963575_Predictive_Runtime_Verification_of_Timed_Properties","234827571_Cheddar_A_Flexible_Real_Time_Scheduling_Framework","320089731_Assertion-Based_Verification_for_SoC_Models_and_Identification_of_Key_Events","313951461_Run-time_verification_of_regularly_expressed_behavioral_properties_in_robotic_systems_with_logic-labeled_finite_state_machines","220431427_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multiprogramming_in_Hard-Real-Time_Environment","220115026_A_Note_on_Preemptive_Scheduling_of_Periodic_Real-Time_Tasks"]}
