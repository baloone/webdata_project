{"id":"289756047_Co-Word_Analysis","abstract":"In formulating and executing broad spectrum research policy, it is important to understand how research thrusts have interrelated and evolved over time, how they are projected to evolve, and how different types of interventions from sponsors and policymakers can affect the evolution and impact of research. While a panel of experts could provide an acceptable view of the trends and interrelationships within a narrowly-defined research area, identification of the connectivity of a broad range of areas is well beyond the expertise of any one panel of experts, and perhaps beyond a group of panels. An integration of topics and trends requires supplementation to the standard peer or analyst group evaluation. Much recent effort has been focused on development of more objective quantitative approaches for analyzing and integrating written and survey information to supplement analysts or groups of peers in understanding research trends.","authors":["Ronald N.
