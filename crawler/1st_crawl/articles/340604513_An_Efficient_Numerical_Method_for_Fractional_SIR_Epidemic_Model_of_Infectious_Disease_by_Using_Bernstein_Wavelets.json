{"id":"340604513_An_Efficient_Numerical_Method_for_Fractional_SIR_Epidemic_Model_of_Infectious_Disease_by_Using_Bernstein_Wavelets","abstract":"In this paper, the operational matrix based on Bernstein wavelets is presented for solving fractional SIR model with unknown parameters. The SIR model is a system of differential equations that arises in medical science to study epidemiology and medical care for the injured. Operational matrices merged with the collocation method are used to convert fractional-order problems into algebraic equations. The Adams–Bashforth–Moulton predictor correcter scheme is also discussed for solving the same. We have compared the solutions with the Adams–Bashforth predictor correcter scheme for the accuracy and applicability of the Bernstein wavelet method. The convergence analysis of the Bernstein wavelet has been also discussed for the validity of the method.","authors":["Dr. Sunil Kumar","Ali Ahmadian","Ranbir Kumar","Devendra Kumar"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.3390/math8040558"],"references":["340031319_SARS-CoV-2_and_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_What_We_Know_So_Far","338734509_An_efficient_numerical_scheme_for_fractional_model_of_HIV-1_infection_of_CD_4_T-cells_with_the_effect_of_antiviral_drug_therapy","338589652_A_new_Rabotnov_fractional-exponential_function-based_fractional_derivative_for_diffusion_equation_under_external_force","338130495_Analytical_approach_for_time_fractional_wave_equations_in_the_sense_of_Yang-Abdel-Aty-Cattani_via_the_homotopy_perturbation_transform_method","336087027_Numerical_solutions_of_nonlinear_fractional_model_arising_in_the_appearance_of_the_strip_patterns_in_two-dimensional_systems","340356231_A_study_of_behaviour_for_immune_and_tumor_cells_in_immunogenetic_tumour_model_with_non-singular_fractional_derivative","338308580_Similarities_in_a_fifth-order_evolution_equation_with_and_with_no_singular_kernel","337122863_Nonlinear_Dynamics_of_Cattaneo-christov_Heat_Flux_Model_FOR_Third-grade_Power-law_Fluid","335878064_A_new_analysis_of_fractional_Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson_model_with_exponential_memory","335842040_An_efficient_technique_for_nonlinear_time-fractional_Klein-Fock-Gordon_equation"]}
