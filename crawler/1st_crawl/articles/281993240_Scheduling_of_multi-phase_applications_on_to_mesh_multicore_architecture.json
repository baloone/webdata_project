{"id":"281993240_Scheduling_of_multi-phase_applications_on_to_mesh_multicore_architecture","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a new approach for off-line scheduling and binding of multi-phase applications onto multicore where cores are connected using mesh topology. Multi-phase application can be easily modeled as chain of multiprocessor task. Our scheduling strategy uses critical tasks first heuristic along with dynamic programming to schedule the chain of multiprocessor task on to multiprocessor system. We modeled binding (phases to processors) problem in information theoretic model, geometric model and sequence alignment model. Finally using chain creation and efficient chain mapping strategy (based on mixed of all three model) to bind scheduled phases on to processor grid to reduce overall data movement overhead. Experiment results shown that our scheduling strategy takes up to 31% less makespan time than the simple critical first strategy to schedule all applications. Binding strategy reduces up to 49% data movement overhead compared to naive and others binding strategies.","authors":["Desai Suresh Kumar Amrutlal","Aryabartta Sahu"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1109/INDICON.2014.7030459"],"references":["225838492_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Two-Processor_Systems","221458572_Critical_Path_Analysis_for_the_Execution_of_Parallel_and_Distributed_Programs","3635337_Analysis_evaluation_and_comparison_of_algorithms_for_scheduling_task_graphs_on_parallel_processors","2954491_Task_scheduling_in_multiprocessing_systems","277298441_A_Minimal_Fragmentation_Algorithm_for_Task_Allocation_in_Mesh-Connected_Multicomputers","242428320_Bounds_for_Certain_Multiprocessing_Anomalies","242361504_Parallel_Sequencing_and_Assembly_Line_Problems","230595985_Optimization_and_Approximation_in_Deterministic_Sequencing_and_Scheduling_A_Survey","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","223778632_On_the_effectiveness_of_phase_based_regression_models_to_trade_power_and_performance_using_dynamic_processor_adaptation","223427704_Scheduling_multiprocessor_tasks_with_chain_constraints","222911742_Analysis_and_evaluation_of_heuristic_methods_for_static_task_scheduling","222638389_Scheduling_chain-structured_tasks_to_minimize_makespan_and_mean_flow_time","222154429_NP-Complete_Scheduling_Problems","220884799_Complexity-based_program_phase_analysis_and_classification","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220618170_Scheduling_Interval-Ordered_Tasks","220566518_Static_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Allocating_Directed_Task_Graphs_to_Multiprocessors","220420238_A_Comparison_of_List_Schedules_for_Parallel_Processing_Systems","4020452_Phase_tracking_and_prediction","3226436_Energy-_and_Performance-Aware_Incremental_Mapping_for_Networks_on_Chip_With_Multiple_Voltage_Levels","3186906_A_taxonomy_of_scheduling_in_general-purpose_distributed_systems","3046368_A_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_the_Critical_Path_Method_for_Scheduling_Tasks_on_Multiprocessor_Systems","2556955_Phase_Tracking_and_Prediction","2325139_A_Comparison_of_Multiprocessor_Scheduling_Heuristics"]}
