{"id":"320512078_Unmet_needs_for_analyzing_biological_big_data_A_survey_of_704_NSF_principal_investigators","abstract":"Author summary\nOur computational needs assessment of 704 principal investigators (PIs) with grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) confirmed that biology is awash with big data. Nearly 90% of BIO PIs said they are currently or will soon be analyzing large data sets. They considered a range of computational needs important to their work, including high performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics support, multistep workflows, updated analysis software, and the ability to store, share, and publish data. However, a majority of PIs—across bioinformatics and other disciplines, large and small research groups, and 4 NSF BIO programs—said their institutions are not meeting 9 of 13 needs. Training on integration of multiple data types (89%), on data management and metadata (78%), and on scaling analysis to cloud/HPC (71%) were the 3 greatest unmet needs. Hardware is not the problem; data storage and HPC ranked lowest on their list of unmet needs. The problem is the growing gap between the accumulation of big data—and researchers’ knowledge about how to use it effectively.","authors":["Lindsay Barone","Jason Williams","David Andrew Micklos"],"meta":["October 2017PLoS Computational Biology 13(10):e1005755","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755"],"references":["323345363_A_Library_of_Congress_Worth_of_Data_It's_All_In_How_You_Define_It","303747619_Early_Engagement_in_Course-Based_Research_Increases_Graduation_Rates_and_Completion_of_Science_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Degrees","279863341_Big_Data_Astronomical_or_Genomical","279183691_Future_opportunities_and_trends_for_e-infrastructures_and_life_sciences_Going_beyond_the_grid_to_enable_life_science_data_analysis","260486291_Assessment_of_Course-Based_Undergraduate_Research_Experiences_A_Meeting_Report","242485770_IT_Engagement_in_Research_A_Baseline_Study","220042256_Atkins_Report_Revolutionizing_Science_and_Engineering_Through_Cyberinfrastructure_Report_of_the_Blue-Ribbon_Advisory_Panel_on_Cyberinfrastructure_National_Science_Foundation_2003","307912731_A_vision_for_collaborative_training_infrastructure_for_bioinformatics_Training_infrastructure_for_bioinformatics","302921628_NSF_director_unveils_big_ideas_with_an_eye_on_the_next_president_and_Congress","276932701_Data_Carpentry_Workshops_to_Increase_Data_Literacy_for_Researchers"]}
