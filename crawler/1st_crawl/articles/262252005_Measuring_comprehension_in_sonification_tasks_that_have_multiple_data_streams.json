{"id":"262252005_Measuring_comprehension_in_sonification_tasks_that_have_multiple_data_streams","abstract":"When the goal of an auditory display is to provide inference or intuition to a listener, it is important for researchers and sound designers to gauge users' comprehension of the display to determine if they are, in fact, receiving the correct message. This paper discusses an approach to measuring listener comprehension in sonifications that contain multiple concurrently presented data series. We draw from situation awareness research that has developed measures of comprehension within environments or scenarios, based on our view that an auditory scene is similar to a virtual or mental representation of the listener's environment.","authors":["Jonathan H.
