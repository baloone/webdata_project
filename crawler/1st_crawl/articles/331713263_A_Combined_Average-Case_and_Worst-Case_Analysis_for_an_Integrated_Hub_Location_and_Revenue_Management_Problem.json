{"id":"331713263_A_Combined_Average-Case_and_Worst-Case_Analysis_for_an_Integrated_Hub_Location_and_Revenue_Management_Problem","abstract":"This paper investigates joint decisions on airline network design and capacity allocation by integrating an uncapacitated single allocation p-hub median location problem into a revenue management problem. For the situation in which uncertain demand can be captured by a finite set of scenarios, we extend this integrated problem with average profit maximization to a combined average-case and worst-case analysis of this integration. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic programming framework to maximize the profit, including the cost of installing the hubs and a weighted sum of average and worst case transportation cost and the revenue from tickets over all scenarios. This model can give flexible decisions by putting the emphasis on the importance of average and worst case profits. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is applied. Computational results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed formulation.","authors":["Jia-Zhen Huo","Yan-Ting Hou","Feng Chu","Jun-Kai He"],"meta":["March 2019Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society 2019(3):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2019/8651728"],"references":["308383481_A_biased_random-key_genetic_algorithm_for_the_tree_of_hubs_location_problem","306239538_A_Combined_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Simulated_Annealing_Approach_for_Solving_Competitive_Hub_Location_and_Pricing_Problem","320405643_Approximability_and_inapproximability_of_the_star_p_-hub_center_problem_with_parameterized_triangle_inequality","320001383_Mathematical_modeling_for_a_p_-mobile_hub_location_problem_in_a_dynamic_environment_with_a_genetic_algorithm_solution_approach","319948862_Developing_an_integrated_hub_location_and_revenue_management_model_considering_multi-classes_of_customers_in_the_airline_industry","316721735_Combining_Worst_Case_and_Average_Case_Considerations_in_an_Integrated_Emergency_Response_Network_Design_Problem","312116069_Survey_paper-airline_yield_management_an_overview_of_seat_inventory_control","309383969_Hub_network_design_problems_with_profits","306146168_Hub_location_problems_A_review_of_models_classification_solution_techniques_and_applications","303779171_A_Fuzzy_Control_Model_for_Restraint_of_Bullwhip_Effect_in_Uncertain_Closed-Loop_Supply_Chain_With_Hybrid_Recycling_Channels"]}
