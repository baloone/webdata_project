{"id":"228544374_Distributed_CTL_Model-Checking_and_counterexample_search","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for CTL model-checking and a counterexample search whenever the CTL formula is not satisfied. The distributed approach is used in order to cope with the state space explosion problem. A cluster of workstations performs collaborative verification over a partitioned state space. Thus, every process involved in the distributed verification executes a labelling procedure on its own partial state space, and uses the parse tree of the CTL formula to evaluate sub-formulas and delay the synchronisations so as to minimise idle time. A counterexample search consists in a distributed construction of the tree-like corresponding to the failure executions. Some experiments have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of this approach.","authors":["Boukala Mohand Cherif","Laure Petrucci"],"meta":["July 2009","DOI:10.14236/ewic/VECOS2009.6","Conference: Conference nameAt: Marrocco"],"references":["234807189_Automatic_Verification_of_Finite_State_Concurrent_Systems_Using_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","228714978_Towards_Distributed_Verification_of_Petri_Nets_Properties","225748551_Accepting_Predecessors_Are_Better_than_Back_Edges_in_Distributed_LTL_Model-Checking","225168619_CTL_model_checking_on_a_shared-memory_architecture","222573260_Using_Assumptions_to_Distribute_CTL_Model_Checking","302282300_Induction_and_Model_Checking","239538939_The_spin_model_checker","238691206_Model_Checking_A_Hands-On_Introduction","234794946_Systems_and_Software_Verification_Model-Checking_Techniques_and_Tools","228591348_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Negative_Cycles"]}
