{"id":"346727967_The_influence_of_boundary_and_edge-plasma_modeling_in_computations_of_axisymmetric_vertical_displacement","abstract":"A number of previously published studies apply extended-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) computations to model macroscopic dynamics of tokamak vertical displacement events (VDEs). The characteristic plasma-wall contact and resistive-wall diffusion imply sensitivity to boundary conditions in a general sense, but which conditions have significant influence depends on how the plasma is modeled. This work examines these dependencies by comparing results of axisymmetric extended-MHD computations with different sets of boundary conditions, plasma thermal-conduction models, and wall resistivity values. The geometry and plasma parameters of the computations represent a modest-sized tokamak. The forced-displacement scenario and computational setup are similar to those used in previous 3D computations [C. R. Sovinec and K. J. Bunkers, Phys. Plasma Controlled Fusion 61, 024003 (2019)]. The results show that for a given wall resistivity, the VDE time scale is most sensitive to variations in the boundary and thermal-conduction parameters that affect electron thermal transport. The electrical conductivity depends on electron temperature, and the dependence on thermal transport stems from its influence on the electrical circuit that includes the open-field halo current. Conditions that lead to hotter, broader halo regions slow the evolution. Significant sensitivity to the boundary condition on plasma flow-velocity exists when electron thermal conduction is restricted and electron energy loss is convective, which is expected for conditions at the entrance of the magnetic presheath.","authors":["K.
