{"id":"315682990_An_analytical_approximation_technique_for_the_duffing_oscillator_based_on_the_energy_balance_method","abstract":"In this paper, an analytical approximation technique has been presented\nof obtaining higher-order approximate solutions for highly nonlinear Duffing oscillator\nbased on the energy balance method (EBM). Higher-order approximate natural frequen-\ncies have been obtained in a novel analytical way. The accuracy of the solution method\nis evaluated within as error analysis. It is highly remarkable that using the presented\ntechnique, the approximation solutions produces desired results even for large oscillation\nas compared with the exact ones. Moreover, the solution method yields much better\nresults than existing solutions after using a suitable truncation formula. The presented\ntechnique is applied to well-known Duffing oscillator to illustrate its novelty, reliability\nand wider applicability.","authors":["Md. Alal Hosen","M. S.  H.
