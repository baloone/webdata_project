{"id":"255658606_Buried_Treasure_The_Impact_of_Computer_Use_on_Young_Children's_Social_Cognitive_Language_Development_and_Motivation","abstract":"Increasingly, young children are being exposed to computers at home and at school despite disagreement regarding the appropriateness and potential impact of technology on young children's development. Many views that predominant the debates lack empirical support and are too broad in their scope. This study examines the existing empirical studies from 1985-2004 on the impact of computer use on preschooler's social, cognitive, language development and motivation. Findings are discussed within the framework of social and cognitive theories by Erikson, Piaget, and Vygotsky.","authors":["Katy McCarrick","Xiaoming Li"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["258933237_The_effective_use_of_computers_with_young_children","258932198_Computers_and_early_childhood_education","255567423_Effective_Learning_Environments_for_Young_Children_Using_Digital_Resources_An_Australian_Perspective","234839719_Young_Children_Parents_Computers_and_the_Internet","234652658_Social_Play_at_the_Computer_Preschoolers_Scaffold_and_Support_Peers'_Computer_Competence","228557118_Strip_Mining_for_Gold_Research_and_Policy_in_Educational_Technology-A_Response_to_Fool's_Gold","12076318_Who's_Wired_and_Who's_Not_Children's_Access_to_and_Use_of_Computer_Technology","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","297220311_CHILDREN_AND_COMPUTERS_-_APPROACHING_THE_21ST-CENTURY","293422092_Young_Children_and_Technology_A_Cautionary_Note","271674314_Teacher-Assisted_Computer_Implementation_A_Vygotskian_Perspective","262412066_Microcomputers_and_Preschoolers_Working_Together_in_a_Classroom_Setting","262326750_An_exploratory_study_of_how_pre-kindergarten_children_use_the_interactive_multimedia_technology_implications_for_multimedia_software_design","258932001_Young_children_and_computers_Crossroads_and_directions_from_research","257496312_Young_children's_collaborative_interactions_in_a_multimedia_computer_environment","255567580_Computers_for_Cognitive_Development_in_Early_Childhood-The_Teacher's_Role_in_the_Computer_Learning_Environment","255567426_Developmentally_Appropriate_LOGO_Computer_Programming_with_Young_Children","255567422_Let's_Play_'Puters_Expressive_Language_Use_at_the_Computer_Center","249737632_Social_Stratification_and_the_Digital_Divide","248909278_The_Effects_of_Computers_on_the_Social_Behavior_of_Preschoolers","248055865_Enhancing_children's_sense_of_self_and_community_through_utilizing_computers","240801801_Cognitive_and_Affective_Effects_of_Various_Types_of_Microcomputer_Use_By_Preschoolers","240793059_An_Examination_of_Software_Used_with_Enhancement_for_Preschool_Discourse_Skill_Improvement","237398789_Technology_Access_for_Low-Income_Preschoolers_Bridging_the_Digital_Divide_1","234721492_One_Head_Start_Classroom's_Experience_Computers_and_Young_Children's_Development","234673567_The_Effect_of_Computer_Software_on_Preschool_Children's_Developmental_Gains","234623524_The_Microcomputer_in_the_Kindergarten","234592078_Social_Patterns_and_Computer_Use_among_Preschool_Children","234577444_Computer_Assisted_Instruction_and_Cognitive_Development_in_Preschoolers","233897157_The_Childhood_and_Society","232934513_The_Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Microcomputers_in_Early_Childhood_Education","232604923_Microcomputers_in_the_preschool_Effects_on_social_participation_and_cognitive_play","232559785_Social_Influences_on_Children's_Problem_Solving","232556070_Computers_and_preschool_children's_play_Are_they_compatible","232496941_Microcomputers_in_Education_Motivational_and_Social_Issues","232491137_Effects_of_computers_and_training_in_Head_Start_curriculum","232485967_Patterns_of_Motivation_and_Social_Behavior_Associated_With_Microcomputer_Use_of_Young_Children","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","222634370_Emotions_and_the_microcomputer_An_exploratory_study_of_young_children's_responses","222450958_Preschool_children's_problem-solving_interactions_at_computers_and_jigsaw_puzzles","8532322_Early_Childhood_Computer_Experience_and_Cognitive_and_Motor_Development"]}
