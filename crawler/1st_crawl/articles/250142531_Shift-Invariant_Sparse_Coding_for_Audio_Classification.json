{"id":"250142531_Shift-Invariant_Sparse_Coding_for_Audio_Classification","abstract":"Sparse coding is an unsupervised learning al- gorithm that learns a succinct high-level rep- resentation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it represents each input as a sparse lin- ear combination of a set of basis functions. Originally applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse coding has also been shown to be useful for self-taught learning, in which the goal is to solve a supervised classification task given access to additional unlabeled data drawn from dierent classes than that in the supervised learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is an ex- tension of sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using all of the basis functions in all possible shifts. In this paper, we present an ecient algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively solving two large convex optimiza- tion problems: The first, which computes the linear coecients,","authors":["Roger Grosse","Rajat Raina","Helen Kwong","Andrew Y.
