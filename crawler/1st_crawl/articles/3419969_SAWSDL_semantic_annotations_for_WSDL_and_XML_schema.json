{"id":"3419969_SAWSDL_semantic_annotations_for_WSDL_and_XML_schema","abstract":"Web services are important for creating distributed applications on the Web. In fact, they're a key enabler for service-oriented architectures that focus on service reuse and interoperability. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has recently finished work on two important standards for describing Web services the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2.0 and Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL).
