{"id":"334834078_rPrism_-_A_Software_for_Reactive_Weighted_State_Transition_Models","abstract":"In this work we introduce the software rPrism, as a branch of the software PRISM model checker, in order to be able to study weighted reactive state transition models. This kind of model gathers together the concepts of reactivity – which consists of the capacity of a state transition model to alter its accessibility relation – and weights, which can be seen as costs, rates, etc.. Given a specific model, the tool performs a simulation based on a Continuous Time Markov Chain. In particular, we show an example of its application for biological systems.","authors":["Daniel Figueiredo","Eugenio Rocha","M. A.
