The strains were chosen to provide a wide view of pangenomic and plasmidic diversity for this important foodborne species.","authors":["Valentin Loux","Gwendoline Coeuret","Monique Zagorec","Marie-Christine Champomier Verg√®s"],"meta":["April 2018Genome Announcements 6(16):e00082-18","DOI:10.1128/genomeA.00082-18"],"references":["257074200_Population_Genetics_of_Lactobacillus_sakei_Reveals_Three_Lineages_with_Distinct_Evolutionary_Histories","233799051_MicroScope-An_integrated_microbial_resource_for_the_curation_and_comparative_analysis_of_genomic_and_metabolic_data","44889778_Darling_AE_Mau_B_Perna_NT_progressiveMauve_multiple_genome_alignment_with_gene_gain_loss_and_rearrangement_PLoS_ONE_5_e11147","23711737_Intraspecies_Genomic_Diversity_and_Natural_Population_Structure_of_the_Meat-Borne_Lactic_Acid_Bacterium_Lactobacillus_sakei","7495299_The_complete_genome_sequence_of_the_meat-borne_lactic_acid_bacterium_Lactobacillus_sakei_23K","6931094_AGMIAL_Implementing_an_annotation_strategy_for_prokaryote_genomes_as_a_distributed_system","46221583_Using_the_Velvet_de_novo_Assembler_for_Short-Read_Sequencing_Technologies"]}
