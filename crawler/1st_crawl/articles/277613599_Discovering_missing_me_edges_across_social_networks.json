{"id":"277613599_Discovering_missing_me_edges_across_social_networks","abstract":"Distinct social networks are interconnected via membership overlap, which plays a key role when crossing information is investigated in the context of multiple-social-network analysis. Unfortunately, users do not always make their membership to two distinct social networks explicit, by specifying the so-called me edge (practically, corresponding to a link between the two accounts), thus missing a potentially very useful information. As a consequence, discovering missing me edges is an important problem to address in this context with potential powerful applications. In this paper, we propose a common-neighbor approach to detecting missing me edges, which returns good results in real-life settings. Indeed, an experimental campaign shows both that the state-of-the-art common-neighbor approaches cannot be effectively applied to our problem and, conversely, that our approach returns precise and complete results.","authors":["Francesco Buccafurri","Gianluca Lax","Antonino Nocera","Domenico Ursino"],"meta":["October 2015Information Sciences 319:18-37","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2015.05.014"],"references":["266400930_Driving_Global_Team_Formation_in_Social_Networks_to_Obtain_Diversity","261282737_Internetworking_Assortativity_in_Facebook","257868094_Link_creation_and_information_spreading_over_social_and_communication_ties_in_an_interest-based_online_social_network","243963336_Reciprocal_and_Heterogeneous_Link_Prediction_in_Social_Networks","236116500_De-anonymizing_Users_Across_Heterogeneous_Social_Computing_Platforms","235779481_Discovering_Links_among_Social_Networks","235356886_Studying_User_Footprints_in_Different_Online_Social_Networks","226566834_A_Survey_of_Link_Prediction_in_Social_Networks","224597148_User_identification_across_multiple_social_networks","221520151_When_Will_It_Happen_-_Relationship_Prediction_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","221273574_Foundations_of_Multidimensional_Network_Analysis","220895424_Link_Prediction_on_Evolving_Data_Using_Tensor_Factorization","220784035_Virtual_private_social_networks","51963861_Using_Proximity_to_Predict_Activity_in_Social_Networks","43148428_Catastrophic_Cascade_of_Failures_in_Interdependent_Networks","3297646_Duplicate_Record_Detection_A_Survey","316660248_A_Model_to_Support_Multi-Social-Network_Applications","304377748_Measuring_Betweenness_Centrality_in_Social_Internetworking_Scenarios","286245141_Joint_Link_Prediction_and_Attribute_Inference_Using_a_Social-Attribute_Network","276033134_De-Anonymization_of_Dynamic_Social_Networks","272600121_A_Self_Training_Semi-Supervised_Truncated_Kernel_Projection_Machine_for_Link_Prediction","265016100_OWA_operator_based_link_prediction_ensemble_for_social_network","263671281_A_system_for_extracting_structural_information_from_Social_Network_accounts","262240493_Connecting_users_across_social_media_sites","261959501_De-anonymizing_social_graphs_via_node_similarity","261040931_Link_Prediction_and_Recommendation_across_Heterogeneous_Social_Networks","259090141_Moving_from_social_networks_to_social_internetworking_scenarios_The_crawling_perspective","257801170_Supervised_methods_for_multi-relational_link_prediction","257676620_Multidimensional_networks_Foundations_of_structural_analysis","256991612_Fast_and_accurate_link_prediction_in_social_networking_systems","256720767_Characterizing_user_navigation_and_interactions_in_online_social_networks","254006820_Stalking_Online_on_User_Privacy_in_Social_Networks","246546930_An_efficient_reconciliation_algorithm_for_social_networks","241624233_Towards_Multiple_Identity_Detection_in_Social_Networks","239761817_Using_community_information_to_improve_the_precision_of_link_prediction_methods","235779496_Bridge_analysis_in_a_Social_Internetworking_Scenario","228439925_SybilDefender_Defend_Against_Sybil_Attacks_in_Large_Social_Networks","222576669_Cena_F_User_Identification_for_Cross-system_Personalisation_Inf_Sci_179_16-32","222546212_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaborations_Physica_A_Statistical_Mechanics_and_its_Applications_3113_590-614","221653511_On_the_Privacy_of_Anonymized_Networks","221614999_Topic_sentiment_analysis_in_Twitter_A_graph-based_hashtag_sentiment_classification_approach","221421120_Steganography_and_Secure_Communication_on_Online_Social_Networks_and_Online_Photo_Sharing","221273643_Probabilistic_Subgraph_Matching_on_Huge_Social_Networks","220783163_A_Forensic_Analysis_of_Images_on_Online_Social_Networks","220310753_The_SocialTrust_framework_for_trusted_social_information_management_Architecture_and_algorithms","49907784_Link_Prediction_by_De-anonymization_How_We_Won_the_Kaggle_SocialNetwork_Challenge","47326911_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks_A_Survey","24165609_De-anonymizing_Social_Networks","11024286_Assortative_Mixing_in_Networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks"]}
