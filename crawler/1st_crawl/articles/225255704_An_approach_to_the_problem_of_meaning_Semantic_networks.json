{"id":"225255704_An_approach_to_the_problem_of_meaning_Semantic_networks","abstract":"An approach to the problem of meaning through the postulation of semantic networks is presented. Subjects generated them for ten concrete and ten abstract nouns with two different procedures. Comparisons were made between the semantic network and the set of associations given to each concept. Finally, both the concrete concepts' and the abstract concepts' networks were compared. It was suggested that a form of meaning is given by the semantic network of the concept, by a reconstructive memory process.","authors":["Jesús G. Figueroa","Esther G. González","Víctor M.
