{"id":"335639181_Management_Capabilities_for_Mobile_and_IoT_Devices_An_Evaluation_Framework","abstract":"Recent experience indicates that mobile and connected devices are increasingly becoming a key enabler of advanced services and applications. Specifically, in the case of the enterprise, they represent a land of opportunities to grow in efficiency and quality with reduced costs and time-to-market. However, mobile and IoT also exposes enterprises to new challenges, such as security and safety risks, scale, heterogeneity, resources constraints, or context fluctuations. This paper introduces an evaluation framework that elicits the needed capabilities to enroll, control, and manage mobile and IoT devices, towards properly integrating them with the organization workflow, in accordance with internal policies. To demonstrate the usability of the framework, the paper presents a comprehensive review of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) and Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions. A preliminary evaluation is conducted with various companies to prove the framework's relevance, ease of use and completeness.","authors":["Asmaa Achtaich","Ra√∫l Mazo","Nissrine Souissi","Camille Salinesi"],"meta":["August 2019International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology 8(6):420-430","DOI:10.35940/ijeat.E7822.088619"],"references":[]}
