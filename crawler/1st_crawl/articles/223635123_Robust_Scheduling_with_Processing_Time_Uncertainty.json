{"id":"223635123_Robust_Scheduling_with_Processing_Time_Uncertainty","abstract":"The scheduling of batch chemical processes has been the focus of a substantial amount of research interest. Work to date has focused primarily on building schedules for processes which are assumed to operate in a deterministic manner. In real world chemical processing facilities uncertainty exists in all facets of the manufacturing environment. The deviations which are considered in this work are those which can be represented as processing time variations. A framework is presented which when used open-loop is an effective tool for evaluating the expected performance and robustness of various scheduling strategies. Two scheduling tools are compared, one which uses the uniform time discretized model and the other uses a non uniform discretization of time.","authors":["S.J. Honkomp","L. Mockus","Gintaras V.
