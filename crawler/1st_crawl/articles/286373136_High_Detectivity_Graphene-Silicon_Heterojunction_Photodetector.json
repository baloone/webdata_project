{"id":"286373136_High_Detectivity_Graphene-Silicon_Heterojunction_Photodetector","abstract":"A graphene/n-type silicon (n-Si) heterojunction has been demonstrated to exhibit strong rectifying behavior and high photoresponsivity, which can be utilized for the development of high-performance photodetectors. However, graphene/n-Si heterojunction photodetectors reported previously suffer from relatively low specific detectivity due to large dark current. Here, by introducing a thin interfacial oxide layer, the dark current of graphene/n-Si heterojunction has been reduced by two orders of magnitude at zero bias. At room temperature, the graphene/n-Si photodetector with interfacial oxide exhibits a specific detectivity up to 5.77 × 10(13) cm Hz(1/2) W(-1) at the peak wavelength of 890 nm in vacuum, which is highest reported detectivity at room temperature for planar graphene/Si heterojunction photodetectors. In addition, the improved graphene/n-Si heterojunction photodetectors possess high responsivity of 0.73 A W(-1) and high photo-to-dark current ratio of ≈10(7) . The current noise spectral density of the graphene/n-Si photodetector has been characterized under ambient and vacuum conditions, which shows that the dark current can be further suppressed in vacuum. These results demonstrate that graphene/Si heterojunction with interfacial oxide is promising for the development of high detectivity photodetectors.","authors":["Xinming Li","Miao Zhu","Mingde Du","Zheng Lv"],"meta":["February 2016Small 12(5):595","DOI:10.1002/smll.201502336"],"references":["273578242_TiO2_Enhanced_Ultraviolet_Detection_Based_on_GrapheneSi_Schottky_Diode","268515793_Solution-processed_hybrid_perovskite_photodetectors_with_high_detectivity","263292696_GrapheneSi-nanowire_heterostructure_molecular_sensors","258341641_High_Responsivity_GrapheneSilicon_Heterostructure_Waveguide_Photodetectors","255759567_Graphenesemiconductor_heterojunction_solar_cells_with_modulated_antireflection_and_graphene_work_function","236915833_Self-powered_flexible_and_transparent_photovoltaic_detectors_based_on_CdSe_nanobeltgraphene_Schottky_junctions","234119622_Experimental_observation_of_plasmons_in_a_graphene_monolayer_resting_ona_two-dimensional_subwavelength_silicon_grating","224978948_Graphene_Barristor_a_Triode_Device_with_a_Gate-Controlled_Schottky_Barrier","45925709_Graphene_Photonics_and_Optoelectronics","6177912_Detection_of_individual_gas_molecules_adsorbed_on_graphene","1763893_The_electronic_properties_of_graphene","282344975_CarbonSilicon_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells_State_of_the_Art_and_Prospects","276364522_High_Responsivity_Broadband_and_Fast_GrapheneSilicon_Photodetector_in_Photoconductor_Mode","272421801_Role_of_Interfacial_Oxide_in_High-Efficiency_Graphene-Silicon_Schottky_Barrier_Solar_Cells","272375428_Photo-induced_selective_gas_detection_based_on_reduced_graphene_oxideSi_Schottky_diode","268154343_Near-Ultraviolet-Sensitive_GraphenePorous_Silicon_Photodetectors","267628019_High-Responsivity_GrapheneInAs_Nanowire_Heterojunction_Near-Infrared_Photodetectors_with_Distinct_Photocurrent_OnOff_Ratios","265732532_50_GBits_Photodetectors_Based_on_Wafer-Scale_Graphene_for_Integrated_Silicon_Photonic_Communication_Systems","264744042_Photovoltaic_Mode_Ultraviolet_Organic_Photodetectors_with_High_OnOff_Ratio_and_Fast_Response","264268601_Anomalous_Behaviors_of_Graphene_Transparent_Conductors_in_Graphene-Silicon_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells","262573612_Hybrid_Heterojunction_and_Solid-State_Photoelectrochemical_Solar_Cells","262381178_Ideal_GrapheneSilicon_Schottky_Junction_Diodes","261139036_Vertical_junction_photodetectors_based_on_reduced_graphene_oxidesilicon_Schottky_diodes","260647000_Ultra-Broadband_Photodetector_for_the_Visible_to_Terahertz_Range_by_Self-Assembling_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide-Silicon_Nanowire_Array_Heterojunctions","260410459_Near-Infrared_Light_Photovoltaic_Detector_Based_on_GaAs_Nanocone_ArrayMonolayer_Graphene_Schottky_Junction","259955920_Light_trapping_and_surface_plasmon_enhanced_high-performance_NIR_photodetector","259491482_Tunable_Reverse-Biased_GrapheneSilicon_Heterojunction_Schottky_Diode_Sensor","259282595_The_Physics_of_Solar_Cells","257778997_Fabrication_of_large_area_hexagonal_boron_nitride_thin_films_for_bendable_capacitors","256663786_Monolayer_GrapheneGermanium_Schottky_Junction_As_High-Performance_Self-Driven_Infrared_Light_Photodetector","236098875_Chemically_Modulated_Graphene_Diodes","236069135_Colloidal_Anti-Reflection_Coating_Improves_Graphene-Silicon_Solar_Cells","236049467_Monolayer_Graphene_Film_on_ZnO_Nanorod_Array_for_High-Performance_Schottky_Junction_Ultraviolet_Photodetectors","235379995_Ion_doping_of_graphene_for_high-efficiency_heterojunction_solar_cells","235373031_Tunable_Graphene-Silicon_Heterojunctions_for_Ultrasensitive_Photodetection","234866772_Oxide_Growth_on_Etched_Silicon_in_Air_at_Room_Temperature","231025774_Studies_of_tunnel_MOS_diodes_I_Interface_effects_in_silicon_Schottky_diodes","230756452_Graphene_An_Emerging_Electronic_Material","229777187_Photoresponse_Properties_of_CdSe_Single-Nanoribbon_Photodetectors","224707051_Graphene_Photonics_Plasmonics_and_Broadband_Optoelectronic_Devices","224515938_Growth_of_native_oxide_on_a_silicon_surface","224411635_MIS-Schottky_theory_under_conditions_of_optical_carrier_generation_in_solar_cells","223538845_Metal-silicon_Schottky_barriers","221780337_Focusing_on_Energy_and_Optoelectronic_Applications_A_Journey_for_Graphene_and_Graphene_Oxide_at_Large_Scale","51074055_Graphene-Silicon_Schottky_Diodes","43081248_Graphene-On-Silicon_Schottky_Junction_Solar_Cells","31839813_Semiconductor_Physics_and_Devices_Basic_Principles_DA_Neamen","4378000_Nonvolatile_Semiconductor_Memory_Technology_A_Comprehensive_Guide_to_Understanding_and_Using_NVSM_Devices"]}
