{"id":"242383678_Polarized_category_theory_modules_and_game_semantics","abstract":"Motivated by an analysis of Abramsky-Jagadeesan games, the paper con- siders a categorical semantics for a polarized notion of two-player games, a semantics which has close connections with the logic of (finite cartesian) sums and products, as well as with the multiplicative structure of linear logic. In each case, the structure is polarized, in the sense that it will be modelled by two categories, one for each of two polarities, with a module structure connecting them. These are studied in considerable detail, and a comparison is made with a dierent notion of polarization due to Olivier Laurent: there is an adjoint connection between the two notions.","authors":["Robin Cockett","R.
