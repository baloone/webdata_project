{"id":"274729977_A_Multiphase_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Fuzzy_Membership_Functions_and_L1-Norm_Fidelity","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a variational multiphase image segmentation model\nbased on fuzzy membership functions and L1-norm fidelity. Then we apply the\nalternating direction method of multipliers to solve an equivalent problem. All\nthe subproblems can be solved efficiently. Specifically, we propose a fast\nmethod to calculate the fuzzy median. Experimental results and comparisons show\nthat the L1-norm based method is more robust to outliers such as impulse noise\nand keeps better contrast than its L2-norm counterpart. Theoretically, we prove\nthe existence of the minimizer and analyze the convergence of the algorithm.","authors":["Fang Li","Stanley Osher","Jing Qin","Ming Yan"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Scientific Computing 69(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-016-0183-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["300887209_Automatic_Prior_Shape_Selection_for_Image_Segmentation","279633786_Multi-Region_Active_Contours_with_a_Single_Level_Set_Function","321620115_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_the_Calculus_of_Variations","312943271_Fast_Texture_Segmentation_Model_based_on_the_Shape_Operator_and_Active_Contour","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","301822646_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1_regularized_problems","275024240_Fast_Partitioning_of_Vector-Valued_Images","274772654_Kernel_Density_Estimation_Based_Multiphase_Fuzzy_Region_Competition_Method_for_Texture_Image_Segmentation","267022926_A_Two-Stage_Image_Segmentation_Method_for_Blurry_Images_with_Poisson_or_Multiplicative_Gamma_Noise","266551628_Mathematical_problems_in_image_processing_Partial_differential_equations_and_the_calculus_of_variations_Foreword_by_Olivier_Faugeras_2nd_ed"]}
