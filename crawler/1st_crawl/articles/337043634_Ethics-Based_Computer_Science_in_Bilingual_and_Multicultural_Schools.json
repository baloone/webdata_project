{"id":"337043634_Ethics-Based_Computer_Science_in_Bilingual_and_Multicultural_Schools","abstract":"For decades, schools have adapted to a technologically-dependent world—developing courses, faculty positions and curricula to begin explicitly teaching with and about technology. Recognizing the need for deepening education in this area, the Lycée Français de New York, a bilingual and multicultural school, developed the digital learning department to lead the school’s thinking and practice around technology and computer science education. Over time, the department shifted its focus from first only the use of computer applications, to an emphasis on computer programming, to a more recent era which includes technology ethics as an equally important area of study. In serving a bilingual school, the Lycée’s digital learning team adapted teaching methods for a bilingual student body. The multiculturalism of the school presents the opportunity for fertile ethics discussions, since cultural values often impact values regarding technology use.","authors":["Adena Dershowitz"],"meta":["November 2019Languages 4(4):87","DOI:10.3390/languages4040087"],"references":["5034005_The_Skill_Content_Of_Recent_Technological_Change_An_Empirical_Exploration","331144485_iPadding_Sixth_Graders_to_Impact_Language_Learning","265402742_Remarks_by_the_President_in_State_of_Union_Address","259822877_The_Teaching_Brain_and_the_End_of_the_Empty_Vessel","240601782_Reference_librarians_and_the_Internet_A_qualitative_study","237795915_Foreword_21st_Century_Skills_Why_They_Matter_What_They_Are_and_How_We_Get_There","237748408_STEM_STEM_education_STEMmania"]}
