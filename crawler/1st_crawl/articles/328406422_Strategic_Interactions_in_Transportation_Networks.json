{"id":"328406422_Strategic_Interactions_in_Transportation_Networks","abstract":"We critically review laboratory experiments on route choice in transportation networks with a focus on strategic interactions among network users. Specifically, we present and evaluate a representative set of experimental studies on route choice in directed networks under strategic uncertainty. We are most concerned with the following question: do the conclusions of theoretical analysis – such as game‐theoretic equilibria in networks with enormous multiplicity that require challenging tacit coordination – and the stark conclusions of major traffic paradoxes that spring from equilibrium analysis of specific models translate into human choice behavior in the reviewed studies? Our survey suggests that the answer to this question is typically affirmative.","authors":["Amnon Rapoport","Vincent Mak","Karen Donohue","Elena Katok"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1002/9781119138341.ch16"],"references":["281127171_Cost-sharing_in_Directed_Networks_Experimental_Study_of_Equilibrium_Choice_and_System_Dynamics"]}
