{"id":"335080518_Research_on_Application_of_Microlecture_to_Teaching_Reform_of_Higher_Normal_Education","abstract":"The progress in computer sciences and information technology provides more teaching modes. Recently, the microlecture has drawn extensive attentions, which could make the knowledge points clear in a shorter teaching time than traditional ways. In addition, it is not limited by time and space. This study makes some explanations and discussions on microlecture in order to apply it to higher normal education. First, the basic concept of microlecture is presented to explain the background. Afterwards, the teaching mode and advantages of microlecture are discussed. Accordingly, its potential in higher normal education can be inferred. Finally, some feasible ways are suggested to apply microlecture to the higher normal education. Conclusions are drawn based on all these analyses. And it is promising that microlecure could make contributions to the teaching reform of higher normal education.","authors":["Li Shuping","Liu Taotang","Zhao Jie"],"meta":["August 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 563(4):042029","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/563/4/042029"],"references":["255705290_Online_formative_tests_linked_to_microlectures_improving_academic_achievement","318418713_Application_Research_of_the_Microlecture_Teaching_Model_in_the_Higher_Vocational_Education_and_Teaching_Reform","308821582_Responsive_mobile_micro-lecture_online_learning_platform_under_MOOC_model","305727975_Exploration_on_the_Application_of_Microlecture_in_Presentation-Assimilation-Discussion_Class","303950576_Exploration_and_Application_of_Micro-Lecture_Platform_in_Modern_Design_Teaching","280217975_Design_of_a_Microlecture_Mobile_Learning_System_Based_on_Smartphone_and_Web_Platforms"]}
